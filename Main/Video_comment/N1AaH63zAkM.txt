Ole out.
Ole should have gone after the CL exit.
Title race? We're doing ok - but top of the league - no way
Not many teams will cope when city play like that u just gotta accept the better team won
I agree with you
Oh my days, No wonder united fans are so deluded.
Maguire looks like a horse rider 🤣 rather than a footballer omg hes not qualified to be a united player at all
Second team Cavani Bailey both help we lost 2-0 so what the league more important I mean that cup not being funny it is never on the cards Europa cup and definitely the Premier League January window coming up
When we have the players out that we have you really should win those games , at home too.
Sack ole
Gold bridge: can I just say as well I’m wearing boohooMAN ........   Me: skips 30 seconds 😂   (I know I ain’t the only one)
Poch is no longer available, cue Ole slump
BOTTLERS 😂😂😂
Bailey and Lindelof, Maguire is weak via low crosses
0:59 I make 172 daily using *f u n d a i l y p a y*
"If that footbal was covid, Harry and Lindelof did a great job at avoiding it....."  Lol
Hahahahahahahaha!!! Nothing again for another year for the ushited fans!!! Manc Cnuts!
I hope Bruno leaves this club soon
MANCHESTER IS BLUE
0:19 I recieve 101 per day with the aid of this right here *f u n d a i l y p a y*
I was always of the opinion that Maguire and Lindelof's combination is a super failure. Yet, Solskjaer always insists on this combination. These two players will definitely sink United for sure. Why do we have to learn every time the hard way?
I could have that focus Mark on all teams every round that let in goals🤣🤣! Focus on why there is no good coaching and playing style! A good coach can make a team play better or we can all be coaches. Manchester City knows how to play without de Bruyne! Manchester United can’t win without Fernandez
When you lost 1-6 against Tottenham you played Bailly but I agree with you, Bailly generally plays with much more gusto than Lindelof and without Bailly against Spurs you would have probably lost by more....
Shame shame On you and your agenda! Why the talk against Lindelof and not Macguire🤔! The loss has nothing to do With the defense Mark! You need to create!
bruno never performs against top six teams
Can't blame manager, the players don't give their all, they lose, ole needs a hard up approach of fergy, you don't perform! You don't play! Too many taking their place for granted
Luke Shaw MOTM ??????????????
BoohooMan is an appropriate sponsor when we lose
How is manU joint top of the league? 🤔
You don't realise it's ole fault, AGAIN? OLE OUT
every time you excel at a job I come for and each time strive to do more better which is better rewarding. this the shout out I promised to make *HARRY_MANDERAKE* keep up the good works
every time you excel at a job I come for and each time strive to do more better which is better rewarding. this the shout out I promised to make *HARRY_MANDERAKE* keep up the good works
Maguire cant play for such a big team and captain it ,luke shaw is not a good player he is a bench warmer give Williams and telles a chance
I'm sure Bailey didn't play as he had a back problem?
people thinking its an agenda against the manager no worry, i just beg u to never make the call Ole out even after u'll later find out his management & tactic knowledge is way way below average. he's constantly clueless and if it wasn't for Bruno we would be nowhere near there. city & liverpool win games no matter who's playing, its called philosophy, system, everyone knows their role. for Utd man mark bruno and its over. Ole cant even set up a team though....
Ole has to take the blame for this
He is definitely the best midfielder in the league but he is either coincidentally always tired by the time they play the big games or he just is ineffective against them period
I disagree saying that Bruno is overrated. However it is quite clear, based off stats alone, that Bruno has such little impact against the big six compared to when Man Utd play lower teams or the likes of everton/leciester etc. No goals in any of the manchester derbies, two pens against spurs, no goals against arsenal or chelsea.
Ole is a useless manager.Ole out.
Mark, if Ole carry on with His cb's....Aston Villa will cme fro behind an steal MU spot...
Ole in 😂😂😝
Ole who
Man Utd loses because they try hard to get a penalty but failed. Martial dive is a joke. So desperate.
Crap game. Need new center backs, the ones we got now doesn't score. We didn't score, lost the game, we need new center backs - that scores. Simple as that.
You cant blame one player ...
I love how he doesn’t mension that Stones was Shaws man, I love Shaw but it’s was a poor performance from him
Could it be that City are just a better team?
Ole Semi Solksjaer
Hahahaha ”if that ball was covid”, classic
We need penalty to win 😭😭😭
Cowboys
We haven’t won against a top team all season.
Shame there was no VAR here to help Bruno n United YET AGAIN 🤔 ..
Bailley pronunciation = bae
Thomas frank for man u manager....
When it comes to crunch ole can't bite
Shaw got double teamed Goldbridge gets double teamed by flex and Ricky every weekend fucking flake
Getting a bit fed up of Ole always playing his favourites.
Bailly is a lot better then lindelof why doesn’t ole play him
Give ole a break, Bailly and Maguire are the pair which conceded 6 against spurs
Pep changed his philosophy. Strong defence, fast transition, no tiki-taka any more.
Martial had moments to hold up the ball and pass and move but does not do it . He lost the ball so much . And when he had the ball did not run at the defence par cheating for a pen . He was no attacking threat at all
It is clear now, Solskjaer took United only so far. It is time for a new solution to take it further.
Ole el kalb out
Why do we have to make Maguire look better ? Get rid or bench the fridge !
Solskjaer out
i've never been Ole out, i've been Martial out for a long time however.
city didnt win because united missed a clearance from the free kick. they dominated 80% of the game time, thats why you lost
Ole never learns. Maguire and Bailly should form a partnership. They must try Lindelof and Tuanzebe as a pair. Mctominay is not good enough for our midfield
Perhaps Ole rested Bailly since he had played 4 full 90 minutes in a row so he’s being rested for the league.
Maguire will NEVER be a Rio or Vidic.. Ole's blind favouritism will cost us this season.. mark my words.. no matter how badly bloody Maugire plays, he knows he will start the next game
Like if we should start Bailly and Tuanzebe in central defence 👇
Ole sold us out to fail by dropping Bailly and matic.
Cavani was our big miss.  If baile had played it would have lost been 5 - 0
I totally agree with you Mark! Leaving Bailly on the bench was a grave mistake. Our foward line was starved as well.
when he started it was im not even going to go on. 15 mins in and still going on about it
Only quality we had was from Pogba and Shaw the rest were not at it last night,just set up wrong needed Eric in there from the the start
Goldbridge  always hating on playing too epic ill droping defenders in the same defense line  Maguire & Lindelof. And he is right who agrees.
I feel like the loosing streak have just started again
Ole the Walley
City are levels above United and will show that over the season. Yet again the manager gets out thought in a semi final
See u in the europa final Olie will bottle it again!!
Ole should not be our manager if we have to be somewhere next season  we lost our chances in the champions league because of this manager  we don't need ole we don't need pochetino  we need ningelsman
Gys let's stop this lie that Ole juss needs a fast CB he is not good enough to manage this club
The team are not good enough to win trophies, that's the bottom line.  We had to man mark them in our half but we didn't and gave them time to receive the ball and make their passes.  Naive tactics again
Was Ole proving to the board he needs signings this window ??
Shaw bullied cancelo
I get your point mark, but I think ole has to manage bailley’s fitness. He can’t play a string of games, we need him for for a pacey Liverpool. So if I had to rest him, I’d do it for this game, because for me, the burnley game is more important.
United lost because they didn't  get a penalty.
Bailly makes me nervous personally. I can see your point about Maguire and Lindelof but they’re more reliable than Bailly. He’s always one minute away from a brainfart or an unnecessary tackle which puts him out for months again. Lindelof and Maguire can’t be doing that badly when we’re top of the league.
Play tuanzebe with bailly when we upamecano comes then play with bailly and upamecano
ole needs to go for sure we are not going to win any thing wiz him walai
It's just useless playing Martial, Pogba, Maguire n Lindelof. It turns out our senior players are most useless, all any top team needs to do is mark Bruno out if the game n we are doomed
Stop talking about Ole’s favorites because you find excuses all the time for Martial and Shaw when they play badly...
If cavani had started he would’ve held the ball up a lot better. It felt like martial lost the ball every time he touched it. Really killed our attacks.
Groundhog Day again. We get carried away after a couple of decent results and then reality hits. It’s clear we have a talented squad but Ole is the issue because he selects the team and formation. He’s getting it right most of the time but every time it matters he choses the wrong team and set-up. 4 semi final defeats and out of the champions league - all due to poor team selection and game management from our coach.
Please, Stop saying we are in a TITLE RACE...... Both City and Liverpool will finish ahead of us....
It's a Scandinavian thing with lindalof I think,he and ole speak the same language
As much as we keep on depending on ole rashford and martial we will never win anything, ole can't help us and we are going to crumble the best we will finish is position 5 simply because ole can't learn will never learn and he succeeds through luck ,
Harry Maguire the fridge is playing the wrong fucking sport. Man can't defend and united spent £80 mill on him. Gonna lose against Liverpool too. If this is the defense for the rest of the season or the future we are not getting any silverware ANY!
Ole at the wheel. Fu(k the 🥕 cup. Yooooonnnnnnniiiiiitid!
Not sure why we don’t look at tuanzebe. We know this pairing doesn’t work and Bailly can’t play every game. He kept Mbappé quiet for heaven sake!
Ole IS CLUELESS ! He's a legend as a player but as a manager he hasn't learned from his rotation mistakes.   TELLES, BAILLEY, DE GEA, VAN DE BEEK had to play ! We.could of won maybe 2-1/1-0
maguire and lindelof just about as effective on defense as the US capitol police today
Luke Shaw had a say in the first one not just the CBs
RioVidic 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really dont understand this Manager when it comes to team selection at times. First of all, I dont see how the hell Dean Henderson is rated better even than Sergio Romero. Then Maguire and Lindelof  are so damn poor, why does the manager stick to these two heads????!!!!!
Also please bench Martial for sometime.. he has been awful
What does Bailey not playing got to do with Bruno Pogba Martial and Rasford continuously loosing, miscontrolling and shooting the ball away...The Dellusional Stand
As soon as i saw the line up.. magurie and lindelof together..  i knew we were  in for a defensive blunder..
There is no loyalty to playing well! It will cost us the league 💯
I feel for van de beek
Mctominay IS TERRIBLE idk why Ole thinks he's better than Donny I really hate Mctominay
Why bother buying another CB? We already have a better CB Ole won't use him. Why bother buying anybody? Ole don't use new signnings. We can kidnap Van Dijk and Ole will still favor Lindelof and McGuirre. Ole is preference over quality.
The headbutt Luke Shaw gave Cancelo was the best thing he did all match
He's not strong enough or good enough I'm afraid played right into shitys hands last night
whenever scot and lindelof play in the same team we lose.
there is def favoritism bro. it's very obvious. dvb on the bench for scott? Scot is useless I'm telling you, he is the lindelof of the midfield.
Eish
Ole had the opportunity to win 4 titles by now and he bottled it everytime.
80 mil for Harry maguire 😂😂
Macguire n Lindelof  and  Mctominay n Fred....the reasons why Ole will get himself sacked.
don't see how shaw was motm, average game at best but keep defending him
mark is mum about his favourite player luke shaw ho was also poor
Why didn't he pick Tuanzebe and lindelof, they worked against PSG, Maguire and lindelof dont work.. They both slow and makes our midfield look bad.. Because they must protect those two slow centre-backs, and then they will have a bad game because they always out of position because they defending too much..
BET YOUR EYES ARE SHOT .......WATCHIN THAT DRIZZLE FOR 5 YEARS !!!!
PENANDEZ GOT A SEMI   !!!!!
alternate reality ......glasses boy !!!! got a semi is it ? neer mind sure to get a penandez !!!!
OLE OUT!!!!
Mark goldbridge>>dt
You are not in title race. Even Spurs were top of table few weeks ago. Liverpool and City are the only sides capable of creating the consistency unlike Utd. Few poor games and fight for top 4 shall begin
They didn't want to win...Sorry but POGBA plays crap, he must go.
Hey Mark
I coulda sworn the green screen flickered for a second and I could see martial’s colon
Ole won't buy a fast CB or play Bailly because he's got Victor the vacuum!😭
We have all the girth and length but can’t get past a semi. Take some viagra and get a CB this month
Our coach is not good enough to handle big matches..sad 😭 but its true..😡
Do our coaches watch this to get a few pointers
He favors Lindelof way too much. Scandinavian connection. Nowhere near City with half their team out.
Mark is on the sat down with friends before the game and everyone said the exact same thing we are just a different team with Bailly in the centre making those darting runs across midfield and passing it off...wtf is Ollie doing he did the same in the semifinal against Sevilla when Eric had an excellent game the previous quarter final..my fucking word what does he Se that we are not seeing
eric bay-hee
Sell Lindelof and Mcguire. Not good enough for top level football.
Please stop imagining this team will challenge for the premier league title because they won't! OGS is clueless.
It will take Ole more than 5years to win what Jose won in 2yrs.
We had the opportunity to get Ruben Dias for 54 mil but we went on to spend 80 mil on that fuckin slabhead. That is called stupidity.
I don’t want a manger that has favorites btw
I don't know why Henderson was that high and Lindelof and Maguire were that low? Come on, it's set pitch? What did you expect them to do, it's zone defend? It was about the team's system, not any individuals? Maguire was great in the match anh Lindelof didn't make any mistakes, what did you expect?
If you're tired of talking about them, then talk about your boyfriend, Shaw who left his man! Simple football.
United should own up they made mistake with Maguire. Buy new one like city did. And bench him.. otherwise it will cost us more than 80mil overall.
Why can’t maguire ever keep his body on the line
Maguire out
Mark I reckon he dropped Bailly to give him a rest because he's made of fine china & the league is the holy grail? I hope anyway because a one eyed man could see our defence is better with Bailly.
Ole is a joke. That game needed Erick, Matic, and Van De Beek to start in place of Victor, Fred, and McT
Ole on the wheel 🚒🚜
I am tired of moaning about that stupid partnership😌
Eric Bailly for captain!
Does anyone honestly think Ole can win us a trophy? We seem to be outplayed whenever we face teams with quality players with a tactically good manager. Just don’t see how we win that game even if we had better players.....didn’t look like we had a clue.
Doing the same thing and expecting the same result is the result of insanity. Bench Lindelof please
Ole is stubborn and arrogant for no reason
Maguire keep watching d ball passing him  by in the box.. foolish
Goldbridge is aging and u hate to see it
I would rather play Bailey against Burnley and Liverpool I don’t think he wanted to risk Bailey because he’s injury prone.
Liverpool and ManCity has passed their previous Defensive woes to us to solve while they have solved it with Gomes and Van Dyke;and Dias and Stones Respectively; Liverpool and ManCity have solved their  CB pairing issues while our Manager and Coaching staff are still denying what is so obvious for all to see ! : that our CB pairings is Shambolic !
I think bailey was dropped because ole knows he is injury prone and wants to save him for the better games of the season... We need to buy a bloody cb or start playing tuannzebe and mengi
Calm down you dork ffs
I'm sad 😔
Manchester is Blue
MARTIAL OUT....IMMEDIATELY
I told from the start that this manager will take us nowhere if he wins you forget his weakness.   Players are good but manager is useless his selection is poorest
I honestly think FRED is no good either This dude is too aggressive with the slides he does not need to slide when the situation does not demand
so table is fake.. ole always bottles it. favoritism...4th semi final lost.
Maybe ole was resting bailey
Ole should have taken Bruno off for DVB. Even the best players have off days of fatigue from time to time. Leaving Bruno on for 90 mins is criminal when you’re chasing the game, and cowardice from our manager.
De Bruyne looks tired this season.  Lots of puffing and panting.
I really don't care about the CB situation, yeah it sucks, I'm more concerned about having strikers that can't score.
You keep criticizing the cbs but we don’t see you criticizing the clowns Rashford and martial they’ve been playing for 5 years now and we still didn’t see anything from them that says they are man United players ! One is so lazy the other can’t make the right runs and can’t finish !
have a question is harry worldclass when he was at leicester?
Bailly need to be secured only for PL matches. We are in a title race !!!
Ole will never learn even if his life depended on it. He is a stubborn bull. All the BJ he gets from Lindelof probably...a swedish Bj...probably better than his norwegian wife. Tired of his bloody selection.
There is too much support for Rashford from management. Lot of good players on bench way better than him
As I’m watching this I’m feeling more and more relaxed. Maybe this loss is a blessing in disguise, League wise.
Should have played Shaw as left sided cb, telles on the left, replace maguire with Bailey, and donny for mctommony
SHAW Man Of The Match for sheer passion alone.   Well done, Luke.
I don't  why when we play bigger team's  we go in the game with the mentality of we have to defend  why can't  we play like Southampton did when they play why liverpool  Why do we go to the game to lose
We are not in a title race...what a load of bolax
Our cb pair should be Maguire and Baily......Lindelof  and Tuanzebe..... This is perfect pairing I guess
Ole out 👞 rashford out 👞 martial out 👞
This couch is fucking fool
United got schooled so bad. From my couch i felt suffocated watching that game.
Rubbish result. No Bailley..i knew we would lose. Seeing the defensive partnership between laurel and hardy...i am not surprised by the result. Negative tactics...7 man defense..its bullshit.
Dan James Football IQ: 6  Marcus Rashford Football IQ:5
We are not in a title race with this form sorry, when was the last time we beat the one of the big six?
We cant win them all...but Ole need to do the right thing by playing the right players...
Huhhhhh. Solskjaer 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. He is so stubborn it costs us when we need it the most. Goldbridge was so pissed his English failed him.
As soon as soon as i saw victor alongside harry..i knew we'd lost...why bailey didn't play still baffles me.
All I want from Bruno is to do the simple things right. That was a zero rating performance from Bruno.
Ole out already ... Missed on Poche....
scapegoating lindelof but bruno didnt put a foot wrong
I will be pissed off if Ole plays Maguire & Lindelof together at defence again, just can't understand what's his obsession with these two where they don't compliment each other. Whenever Bailly plays at the defence with either of them, United defend well coz Bailly & Maguire compliment well each other. Except Bailly none of these two defenders can defend low cross from either side of the box, we often see that, we even saw that against Sevilla in Europa League last season. On the other hand, Bailly alz throws himself in front of the ball, we've so many evidences of his defence. Even the fans can see that, some of the United greats can see that but Ole can't see 😑. I'm still Ole in but with these two at defence together he just can't win any trophy that's for sure.   Even SAF said once "Attack wins you matches but defence wins you titles".  Rio Ferdinand said just a few days ago "Those two defenders give me nightmare". But still there are some fans around here who really don't think that we need a CB ASAP.
We need a new defense and manager.
I think why he played this Team could have been that Ole was afraid of Man. City. He feared a team that is over rated, he gave them to much respect. Mcgiure and Lindalof play too deep, Bailly works hard and gives Mcguire a means to stay deep. If Ole keeps this up United will end up Mid Table. Stop fearing Liverpool and man City, if they were great both would be leading the league  by a least 5 points.  best team in England don't make laugh.
Donny sold go this window again his a super star is better than man united should of waited for a better club he was linked to real madrid
The scoreline shows where United stands! Arsenal will soon catch us in the league too, watch and see guys!
On top of the result, bailly probably thinking like " what do I gotta do to get a fair run?" Bailly was in form, lindelof was off the heels of an injury. Like, make it make sense.
Maguire it terrible. Is it possible to get smalling back so he can play alongside Eric.  Maguire it done and he is are captain. Shambles
hope he doesnt start Bailey in that stupid FA cup....out focus should be only PL
I think we need to touch up on our tactical understanding if we think Eric Bailly would have meant we would have won this game.
Disappointed but TBH you have to rotate ur squad explains for the exclusion of Bailly..But still baffles me why VDB is not starting games when Bruno clearly needs a rest..Win against Burnley and Scousers at any cost..
I rlly don’t want to see mctominay again he hops around like a rabbit and Lindelof jockeys and cant win a tackle he afraid of being next to maguire get bailly in the game
Poch joins PSG and we lose the next game... strange isn't it 🤔
I would have Bailly-Lindelof as first choice, and Tuanzebe-Maguire as backup... but of course a new fast CB would be amazing!
Not a bad game?? he shook his head at the ball time and again at crosses and clearly plays “after you Claude” when defending.
Maguire and Bailly should play together until we get a new cb who is quick
Bloody hell he has Boohoo and now betting. This guy is worse then the Glazers for taking Utd fans to the cleaners.
Go back a few years and play Ferdinand wake up and smell reality - OGS - obstinacy will only take this great club down a tunnel of mediocrity.
Why does he keep on bottling crucial games 🤦‍♂️
Don’t defend Martial he should be prosecuted for non trying to impersonate a CF.
Mark.....Oli never learn.... i hope he learn fast...we can win the title..we must use Eric Bailly or axel tuanzebe with Harry Maguire or victor lindelof...
How has tuanzebe barely played as a centre back since his amazing PSG performance
Dalot playing like best RB in seria A and in world and we loaned him to keep a player who can't play but just tackle.
OGS shows time and again his tactical naivety coupled with his sub decisions clearly shows that this manager attempting to learn on the job is taking this great club nowhere which will clear to be seen in the coming fraught months.
This is what happens when we missed on another good coach i.e poch n stick with this idiot..
Uniteds problem is not only putting Bailly on the pitch, its much deeper than that. U will see.
Mark do you think ole thinks maguire and  lindelof are good enough and he thinks a  new cb is a backup.
It’s no surprise both those CB’s move like tankers if not worse as many a time they are static and stand and watch.
Honestly, Bruno's worst game today even though City played well. We had in really good positions at times in first half and Burno's final ball was appalling for his standard
Ole keeps on saying players need rest and now not making subs is like ...
Maybe top 4 behind Man City - Liverpool -  Tottenham - although 5th if Southampton  continue progressing.
When things go bad then the heads drop now I am worried about burnley
We lost... that’s it. Don’t need to be ‘fuming’ every time we lose. Look at the run we have been on. If he had made changes tonight and they won you would say great squad use by Ole...
Title race or not, Ole needs to be sacked for making the most obvious and glaring errors over and over and over again. Get him out.
Saying we can win the title is niev as this players are bunch of bottlers. Now we have lost 4 semi final.
Ole OUT IN TUCHEL
Comback lukaku & ibra , trio pogba ibra lukaku
Mark why Maguire isn't being dropped. Making Maguire the captain of the team is the greatest error Ole has made
Mark your so right ole dont wanna use bailey idk why
maguire and lindelof just don't work, can't ole just see this fact, omg
Semi Final F.C
we should have draw to brentford
The main problem with ole is, he dares to try something new, which is good, but when the pressure comes, he caves back to his own former beliefs. 4 semi finals now, and it's a recurring story.   He has done a great job, but if we really want to win titles, he's not the man.
Bloody Burnley
It not the end of the world but you see how Ole can't change his mind, he's going in circles all the time. Maguire-Lindelof, McTominay, James, not picking VDB... I'm fed up. We're not winning the league with Ole as manager.
Like martial but he has got to stop diving it’s ridiculous, even I could see it. Tbh he is ruining some chances by diving when he could continue his run.
Losing a game after being undefeated 9 in a row makes a manager a pe teacher and his players dumb idiots. A warm welcome to the glory hunters cause we have just lost a game
Ole in fans deserves this 😂
We still not on City’s level,de bryne is on another level in midfield..We only can improve but we not there yet..We not ready to be champions yet,they all look tired and worn out.
We need a defender to partner Baiiley. Maguire and lindoloft are crap
You're just not that good. You've been awful most of the season. The only reason you're "in the title race" is because Sky and the Premier League want a Man U vs Liverpool title race so the officials have been helping you every game. If football wasn't so corrupt you would be midtable.
Harry Maguire let that ball come across him and took no responsibility to clear it.   Scott McTominay was an invisible man losing the ball all the time and did he make a tackle at all Ole?!   When we had the ball we could not keep any pressure on them, who would have helped? DONNY VAN DER BEEK on the bench!
Your not angry because its the league cup and were not Tottenham
Shouldn't even be in the title race fraud officials giving away all them free penalties kloop is right
I am harsh on this channel!!!!! Transfer window is a joke here BUT I honest believe goldbridge knows the best team. Ole is a fucking joke!!!! Get him out
Solskjear out u muppets
You all guys are scared to blame ole for four semi finals defeats, we cannot win any thropies with ole. He has no idea about the football  he only has a coaching badge. He spends more time on the bench as a  coach than when he was a player for Manchester united
I knew we would lose after seeing that lineup. We could have made 5 subs and saved the game. I can't believe we messed this one up.
OLE OUT
WHY THIS OLE ALWAYS PUT RASHFORD ON CF!!??HE IS NOT BLOODY CF,HE IS WF!!!ALWAYS PUT MAGUIRE ON CAPTAIN WHO IS BIG FRIDGE 😤😡😡
Goldie are you thick ??? Bailey is not Maguire who can play every game....so ole needs to choose games in which he can play so that he lasts as long as possible how can you not see it it's cause you're too rational and someone who loves to moan all the time
Maguire needs too be droped not lindelof
if we play bailly, we don’t have to play mcfred, would love to see bailly with fred and donny in midfield
u proably are a better coach then ole
Ole cost us the games..city,Leipzig, psg,Sevilla n Leicester
We lost the ball up front nearly every time we got there
Mark stop saying Alaba we sticking with the Fridge and lindeldof
Mark stop talking about signing we won’t sign cause ole do not use them. Our slump will be starting soon
Now title contender, in 6 games time  sack Ole
“Maguire and Lindelof would sit in the stands if they could they play so deep.”. Lol 😂 😂 😂 😂
Bruno is fantastic but Luke Shaw is our player of the season so far. The backlash he gets is ridiculous and it reveals an absolute lack of understanding of the game.
Bruno played like Andreas today 😔
We are not in the title race. We are second rate with a third rate manager. Rashford and Martial need to be dropped and replaced by Cavano (after suspension) and greenwood. Rashford could score five own-goals and United fans would still think he's great. He's not and Martial is even worse.
Is Vdb doing the dirty with Ole’s ting or what!?? Free the Mandem!!
Neva deserves to be in the final
Lindelof gets a full match while Van Der Beek gets four minutes.
Just say it...Ole suck
You sound as deluded as Ty on AFTV if you think picking bailly would have changed things. To be fair you guys were in it. You had some decent moments looking on t to he counter but if you don’t get dodgy decisions you will falter. How many pens have your mob had?? It s disgraceful. Begging for pens all g tot he time. Why want Martial booked for that disgraceful, conning, cowardly dive tonight??
A title race is more than just being level on points but go off chief 😂
Deja vu.....happening again...wheels are coming off..... another trophyless season...
I now know our players are good but  the manager is bottler.
Ole needs to focus on winning some form of silverware. FA cup's our only hope now since we're not even close to competing with Liverpool for the title nor do we have a chance of winning the Europa League
Drop maguire he has to be one of the worst defenders I’ve ever seen gets away with it because he’s English lindelof is well better then him
I did my predicted lineup and the two players that were missing, bailly and de gea😑 could’ve been game changers
If ole doesn’t recognize he needs bailly in his defence than I’ll be joining the ole out brigade! Can’t believe that he doesn’t slot in beside Maguire, the new centre half connection we needed!!!
He is probably sparing Eric bailly for the Premier League games
Dont church further whay eric baily dont it just because he is not a english
Man brings on VDB with 4 minutes to go.. what a dickhead I feel sorry for donny like what kinda message is ole sending him..
He should stay till may but then it’s time to go even if we win the league..it will be in spite of ole not because of him. Literally one of my favorite players growing up but he should know he is out of his depth and have brought In a A+ coaching and training staff not ones that are as green as he is.
beaten all over the pitch and its the centre backs fault ! Pathetic excuse.
We need a cb soon
Title race?!! You can't be serious 🤔
Man united is becoming traditionaly semi final club 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Literally only good thing the less games more focus😂🤦🏻‍♂️, bring on FA Cup & Europa & Prem
You spend too much time faulting Man U. City played so well tbh
Man United will go as far as Bruno can carry them.. 39% possession vs City at Old Trafford, Spurs were the same at Anfield. City and Liverpool are still by far the two best teams in the country. Man United are improving but they aren’t quite there yet.
utter bullshit.
If ole drops Bailey for lindelof in the league he has to go period.
When do we ask why we always play like the minnow? Against any team worth a damn we sit back and defend! Always...we never try to boss the game against decent opposition
We may be in a title race, but we can't win the race with these performances 😕 sigh!
Ole is useless and full of player favoritism that's  his biggest down fall as a P.E Teacher!!
maybe he played maguire and lindelof so he would get a cb in january
I pray we bring in that much needed CB this window, its the only signing that could make a difference for where our season will go weather challenging for the title or just another upset season falling down the table..
Klopp did lose 7 finals tbh
Utd will always  be second best to city BLUE MOON RISING
But nah seriously what’s wrong with martial he was unreal last season and now it’s as if he’s forgotten how to pass and shoot
Why is tuanzebe not starting we need a centre back and caicedo
U are absolutely wrong mark. Ole did big mistake. How many mistake that a manager did to make him to be sacked? Ole did many mistakes. He even didn't know his first eleven. Played a very wrong players to play in a big game. What kind of manager he is. The worst manager not only in EPL but in the whole world. Boring, hate, and fed up to se his smile
JOINT SEMI-FINALISTS 😂😂😂😂
Ole signing a new player Viagra,  hopfully get them over a semi
Ole doesnt seem to have it all together
Yet to see Bruno turn up in a big game🤷‍♂️
Guys, can u see mictominay? He looked so cool and Happy even he played so worst. U know why? Because as long as ole as a Man United's manager, he is always in safe position because ole always chose him as first eleven over VDB.
Martial does too much sometimes instead of shooting and fernandes was poor today probably his worst game since his arrival  same with rashford wasn’t great but we didn’t play all bad just didn’t create enough now let’s just move on to Watford who we should beat and carry out form in the league and win Burnley then anfield just heads up and bailly has to start next game and every game now if your Gna rest him start tuanzebe we lose suddenly as bailly isn’t here and sometimes know when to start matic coz he’s effective but let’s move on now
UTD are shite.
It’s as if he was taking the piss when he brought van de beek on
No mark. Ole never learned anything. How many semi finals he lost? He is so stubborn, full of ego. Mictominay bulshitt but ole still played him over VDB because he love mictominay and not to VDB. He played lindelouf over baily because he love lindelouf than baily. Believe me, he never played baily over lindelouf and VDB over mictominay. This two player he chose as first eleven.
OLE FUCKING EXPOSED BY FAVOURTISM
Spent £40 at boohooMAN to make myself feel better. Didn’t help
I'm loving it.... unlucky KG. 🤣🤣👍
Ole is poor
Ole the bottler.. Ole is not a Top Coach...
I'll say it for you, MG.....Ole doesn't have enough tactical nous!  He is extremely limited even with his tinkering 'lucky dip' tactics!
I believe that the biggest problem in  Manchester United is Harry Maguire.  Absolutely useless player who doesn't deserve a sh*t. And at the end he is our captain. Ole and harry out. you can't depend on both of them
Be honest Mark. Just say ole out. It's not hard to say that because from now on, man united is going to drop point because his stupidity. Honestly, even u said pochettino didn't won anything, but if pochettino be a man united as a manager with players like ole have, he difinitely did better than ole because ole is really blind, clueless, and so bias. Ole must full responsibility by asking the board to sack him
Pogba agenda again!
😂😂😂😂💙🌛💙🌛💙🌛 Blue moon you saw me standing alone ....MANCHESTER IS BLUE
PE teacher
We're in the title race- Utd fans: the gift that keeps giving.
no penalty, no party haha
martial had the ball and tried to dribble THROUGH players about 5 times that match, when will he learn that he can’t do that? he does it every game. and don’t call this an agenda mark, this is a fact. i like martial normally, but the amount of times he tried to be smart instead of simply put the ball in the net or passing to a teammate was shocking.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2-0 bottle jobs 🍼🍼🍼😂😂😂😂😂
Or maybe City was just better than us on the day...of course disappointing - but the league is what matters. I'm sure, Eric will be back fresh for Liverpool. He has been out for a long time, I think it was right, to rest him for this one and maybe also for the Watford game.
Tbh the minute I saw Maguire and Lindelof, I knew United were going to lose. What really bugs me, however, is why Luke Shaw never thinks of slipping Martial a through ball?! He had multiple opportunities today. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Need score to Win. Sell Maguire! sell McT. Wan bissaka is a benchplayer, need a offensive RB, CB, CDM, CM and RW (left fot)
Another semi-final loss hurts man. I need some silverware Ole, it matters for establishing winning mentality and momentum. Hopefully we can make a decent run in the FA cup, Europa League and the Premier League, and our efforts will be rewarded with a title
Some fans said Maguire is better and epl proven...... Actually, he is a crap proven... Slower CB in epl.. Crap... Crap... Crap......... 80mil wasted just like that
Bailly had a back injury, how you gonna blame Ole for picking Lindeloff because of that ffs
Well said mate poor choice poor plan bailey deserves it garbage game today’ from Man Utd a bottom league side result
Play higher up against city?? R u kiddin, they punish every team who does that. Lets face it they were much better then us today. Bailly would not have made a change on the result. Bailly usually makes mistakes or gets red card in high intensity games like this where he gets over excited
Rashford on the right doesn’t work im sorry. Get Greenwood back in on the right and put Rashford on the left
Let's be real, he didn't include Bailly to prevent injuries for the Burnley game. He doesn't want to be greedy.
Sell Maguire, Pogba, Lindelof, Shaw, Wan Bissaka. Play Van De Beek every game.
Don't despair, Ole the Legend, the chosen one , the confident one will lead United to greatness.  Liverpool we will be coming for you after this defeat. This will be another amazing run after a defeat.
Mark are you saying they need to cockblock more?
We will be fighting for top 4 at the end of the season trust me
We really have a weak man as our manager. Grow a spine, Ole! It’s now 4 semifinal loses.
Ole is bad.making wrong decision. Worst, he is as stubborn as an ox
It’s Fernandinho not fernando
Unfortunately Mark there’s no replay our second 🦵 for Eric to prove how wrong you would be 😂😂👍 city city city blue 🌝
Yet again playing with fear... defensive, not compact and when we put pressure its only the front line who does it not the whole team as a unit because the back line is so deep. Small club mentality and meanwhile we have one of the most expensive squads in football history, there is simply no excuse for using the same tactics as Big Sam.
ole will bottle it against Liverpool, no doubt about it.
Wdym martial didn’t get any service, he lost the ball so many times and Rashford put an amazing cross across the front post in yeh second half and martial just doesn’t attack it  Someone saying not a clinical striker based on this game wasn’t right, but he wasn’t a instinctive striker tonight and his general performance when he got on the ball was bad
Masih aja percaya ama oleng, nyuk2
On this display, we are miles away from winning the championship.
Wtf are you on guys. Harry was great tonight
Just  proves we r not that good
It that hard to admit Man City is a better team?? Why everytime Man U loses is their own fault? I dont know man... give some credict to the rival from time to time
Ole hasn't a clue.
Bruno always disappeared in important matches. Overhyped midfielder in this whole world.
Players dont get managers sacked. Managers get themselves sacked. If Ole continues to select Lindelof&Maguire together we will fail. If Mctominay starts regularly we will fail.
💀💀💀💀💀 Bottled 4 semifinals in the row.
i mean city just was the better team
Big clubs cry about # of subs then don't even use them
Ole is making the same mistakes over and over again. When Bruno has a bad game we lose and it really exposes how much we depend on individuals to perform for us. He drops our best defender which then completely changes how we play. I’m not comparing baily to VVD in anyway but dropping baily is like Klopp dropping vvd to play matip instead and what the hell does Donny have to do to get a game. If he plays this same lineup which he will Liverpool will dominate the midfield and suffocate the living day lights out of us.
Cant believe we were on a high after the villa game then Ole just bursts our balloon by picking Maquire and Lindelof again 😠😡😤 and Mcfred 😠😡😤
All Ole know are semis, legend has it that Ole only makes love to his wife with a semi.
Does anyone actually care about this cup? Please forgive me, I'm not English.
Leave it out Mark you're the one with an agenda. Luke Shaw weren't that great, so every match we play you're just going to give him a 7 ffs.
Just sack him!! !! Before it getting worse. In the end, he still pick the donkey in this team.
HAHAHAHAH
The partnership of lindeloft and mcguire is a failure. It is obvious. I dun understamd why Ole still plays them together. Look at the records
Mark has gone asperger with vnl obsessive agenda
We don’t show up in the big games, struggle with a decent/top team
Manchester united is in titale race just like totenham were some days ago,with this coach and without any playing style we will not win anything , all those who think we r in titale race after 16 games r totally deluded its becuse we have not won anything in years so people want to think we will win , we will be in fight for top 4 , remember my words all united fans people talking about titale r just out of their mind
So confused as to why ole keeps making the same mistakes
MAGUIRE CANT EVEN DEFEND, WHAT IS WROING WITH THIS GUY, HE IS USELESS
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE SHOCKING PERFORMANCE, WE WERE DREADFUL, WE COULDNT EVEN STRING PASSES TOGETHER
Everyone laughs when bailly puts his body on the line. Now we can see why.
Mark just realized man City is gonna win the league easily. Aguero back real soon. The league is so weak that a team with no defenders are top. Man United needed to be +10p clear to have real hope.
OLE THE PE TEACHER ! At this point I rather just lose every game till we sack him ! What a disgrace 🤦🏽‍♂️
I remember not that long ago man United fans abusing Klopp for “bottling every final” do you know what’s worse then that? Not even being able to make a single final 😂 joke of a club
Where is tuanzebe??? Plays a mint game against mbappe and Neymar never see him again .  Bailly our best cb. Van de beek has to play more . I love ole but he makes odd team selections at times . I see and mostly agree with his tactics . But he has a hard on for Maguire and lindelof
Ole, the gift that keeps on giving.
The very moment I saw Victory Lindalouf in the team, I gave the match to City. We haven’t learnt our lessons yet until when we start sinking again.
Can someone inform me of the assets McTominay possesses that Van De Beek lacks? I won't accept height as an answer.
Ole has done great job to get MU to the top of the PL....today was the example of killing off the momentum...MU are not finished article and lets hope that Ole will sort it out...
Martial a disgrace
Why doesn't Greenwood go down the middle when he comes on? He's useless out wide. Why would anyone ever play two slow CBs next to each other? Every time I think he's learning...sigh
Maguire and Lindelof should not start together.
i hope meguire breaks a leg , thats the only chance he wont play .
Harry couldn't head a ball for Toffee.
We will never win anything under ole, just keeps playing is favourites, that's four semi finals lost thought ole he's to blame
Mark and his metaphors, lmao, if the divorce doesn't happen between Lindelof and maguire than ole really is clueless...  tuanzebe needs to start playing too!
Looking at Dias at City, makes me awe in envy. Made maguire look like he was playing the wrong sport. Need a new CB
Making Bailly sound like Paolo Maldini. He aint that good
So annoying that we didn’t play Bailly and it’s very frustrating to be knocked out of the cup in another semi final, but we are having a great season right now, can go outright top of the league next week, still in the FA Cup and still in the Europa League (unfortunately not the UCL), having high standards is great but I feel like we are getting ridiculous, we lost a game to a team that has proved over the last number of years they’re a stronger side than us, we are progressing but we are going to lose games in the mean time like every team does! Couldn’t care less about Watford at the weekend but buzzing for the Burnley game!
Disgraceful which way donny is being treated.
We need CAM before CB... Bruno has an off day and we lose !!!!
That's what maguire does he leaves the ball and bailly cleans up but no bailly today😑
Why didnt the " world class Bruno Pen-andes " just dive for pens as he usually does Mark?
Do United really think they are in the title race? Not even half way into the season? Surely you’re smart enough to know that you have yet to beat a big team this season. Eventually city and liveprool will walk away with it and united will be top 4.
Let’s not be naive, bailly wouldn’t have made a difference. We neees a cdm. I mean Fred and mctominay were getti mg breached so badly. We need a midfield general. No one player incredibly bad nor did anyone play above a 7/10, but city wanted it more. If we want to win we DO need to play Bailly but he wont drive us. It’s disapppinting. We lost because they are a better team. Big up the boys, “there’s no failure without success” let’s go get afloat the Prem. CMONNNNN
Tbh 4 semis and 4 losses that's possitve its only matter of time befor we win one
rumour  has it ole is going to put a ring on lindelofs finger next week.
Another failure in the semi. He will never bring us over the line if he keep tinkering..
I feels sorry for VDB.....
Will you ever try out coaching mark. You never know what the outcome could be
Bruno shouldn't have started this match or at least taken him off at half time. He looked tired, lethargic and was inefficient but still kept trying those ambitious passes resulting in loss of possession.
Ole never does subs and yet always complains about player welfare
Maguire is the worst CB I have seen at UTD. he is terrible, overrated english defender.
Rashford should be dropped, not good enough atm. Rather see James on the wings
How can we be in 4 semi-finals and bottle them all
Lol dean henderson a 7? Lol the guy is overrated
Let us make the top 4 first!. Ole is clueless!
The difference between Ole and Pep is that even whilst 1-0 up, he motivates and shouts at his players. Ole sits all comfy on the chair and looks at the bloody iPad
Maguire is non existent
I agree re Bailly - but Bruno, Martial,Pogba and Rashford were all poor too.
Give it a rest fs outclassed from start to finish a different cb wouldn't have changed a thing
He keeps making these crazy decisions. Come on ole stop this madness be brave.
Guys relax , I reckon he was resting bailly for the league. We are allowed to loose
Way too much Abuse towards Maguire/Lindelof. Didnt do a half bad job at all today. Forwards too flat and didnt offer enough today.
mc tominay was quality
We were just outclassed today. I think we need a LW aswell as a CB to give us more options.
UTD have been brought back down to earth. They were getting too mouthy for their own good. Come on city
Its maguire... maguire the harry potter is the problem
Just drop Maguire
Bailly should have started 💯jury still out on ole
We didn't even bother turning up tonight :( !!
Like them full of it 17 in fact🤠
The shocking revelation tonight is that Man city are the biggest threat to Liverpool's title! Unless something changes United are not challenging for anything.
The diving was sub par today
You’re in a title race because the officials are letting you be in one
Lost a carabao cup game and hearing lots of negativity ...one thing I will say is we missed Bailey big time tonight !
You can calm your ass now Goldbridge , you won couple of games due to the help of referees and you forgot who you are, crap team
Actually giving Bruno the same rating as Pogba, the favouritism needs to stop🤦🏼‍♂️
Poor, team selection and tactics.  Ole and coaches again prove they cannot react to anything mid game. No leadership on or off the field.
Bailly should have kept his place and was like playing with 10 men when Paul pogbas picked in the starting line up
I don’t wanna hear any negative comment on Luke Shaw till the end of time
We’re in a title race?😂, let’s wake up, we’re there by sheer chance , the defence ain’t good enough without Bailey. City gonna catch up Soon, and Liverpool will win the league
Maybe ole was making a point to the board that we need a cb
ole can't win us a trophy
No penalty, no party 😂😂😂
Mark Goldbridge lives matter
Bad coaching period..
Bruno has a bad game we lose. He is the reason we good not crap Ole
Bailly & Lindelof should be our CB pair & get a young fast CB in Jan. Badiashile/Kamara
Ole NEEDS to play Bailly against liverpool or our title hopes will be dashed
Bailey carnt play games consecutively he's made of glass think he was saved for prem chase
Semi final bottle FC
Nerdbridge
SIT DOWN...again
Ole playing 4d chess, pressure was building on us with title contender shouts from the media, losing the Mickey mouse cup takes the mounting pressure off the team and back onto him. Tactical masterclass.
Am guessing everyone’s ole out to night then seems the why to go every time we lose
Olli the idiot. .picked the wrong team agian. .
Problem isn't centerbacks. It's the striking and attacking. Lindelöf has been great all season but Marks being autistic about vnl. All his videos are all about vnl needing to go. He keeps repeating himself so much I started turning off the video . He is all about agendas
It's not odd behavior Mark it's scared Behavior you're going to play scared against Liverpool individual Brilliance should win the game but you're going to play scared
How many times are we going to see maguire lindelof Fail and still use it ffs 😐
Even though we lost and it’s disappointing, we didn’t actually play that bad tho. I’m glad we played well in some areas
Back to reality. Hahaha
Back to reality 😂 now a spanking from the champions and everything is back to normal 😂
All 4 of the semi finals we have lost under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have been the same back 4. Shaw/Williams, Lindelof, Maguire, And AWB
Title race after 17 games?
Sad
Just passing by waiting for all the Oleoutists to come out after two months.
We going to win nowt mate.
United has been brought to reality. This is more than enough proof that shows. Man United will not win the Premier League. They will not compete. But will get 3rd place. OLE IN!
I'm telling you guys Ole is a crap manager, the reason he's doing well is because of individual brilliance, bruno single handedly saved ole's job. Ole bottled about 4 semi finals, he always fails the big games. If he cant win a carabao cup then what makes you think he would win us a champions league trophy or anything like that. We will win nothing with this manager.
“If that ball was covid, Harry maguire and victor lindelof did a great job avoiding it” 😂😂😂
United are always delighted with Ali and his Scare Tactics as long as somebody comes along to save the day in the last 5 or 10 minutes you just got to take it when it doesn't happen play scared and hope for the best
Why does it always take ole so long to do Subs. When is the guy gonna learn. What is donny gonna do with three minutes at the end of the game when we r 2 nil down.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Haaaaaaaa....am so sad cos number 2 &  9 so please sells  and I want see real number 9  ole please weak u ole....
As you've said if Lindelof and Maguire remain our CBs ole will lose his job.
OLE NEEDS TO BE SACK IF HE DOESN'T START A PROPER LINE UP.I'M SICK OF IT.EVERYTIME WE'RE IN THE SEMI-FINAL,WE BOTTLED IT.WE'VE BEEN BOTTLED IT FOR THE 4th TIME.THIS IS WHY WE DESERVED TO GET OUT OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP STAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PROPER LINE UP AND THE FORMATION AND TACTICS FROM OLE WAS SO FRUSTRATING TO WATCH
MANCHESTER IS RED HUH? RED FOR PENALTY R'NOW! HAHA
🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Ole lost 4 semi final 😂😂😂😭😭😭 Better than Frank Lampard yeah?🥴
Treatment of VDB is disgraceful. If another club comes to take him, don't be surprised he wants to leave.
I really hope ole shows Maguire and lindelof replays of them on set pieces being diabolical because that's the only way to improve otherwise its insanity.
We got completely outclassed today, a lot of people not at the races but I'm still confident we can push on in the league
Ole cant be united manager if he cant make tough decisions and dropping players If they're not performing. Just buy a CB that he will actually play and give him till may
Terrible game set up by ole. We lost because of the midfield and defence.  Our attacker were poor but that was because of the midfield.  I don't understand the martial slander. He , rashford, Bruno didn't have a good game so why are we focusing on martial. Rashford was invisible and so was greenwood. Why focus on him. Rashford didn't even do anything in the second half and you lot are mute smh
Let's just hope this stupid board buys us a new CB.
This shows how important buying a centre back is, city needed one, got Ruben Dias and now he’s killing it and there defence is so much better!
I'm proud to be Ole out.
🎵 Back to life, Back to reality 🎵
We bottled another semi final this is not progression he’s not learning from his mistakes 😭
Back to reality.
🚫OLE OUT🚫
