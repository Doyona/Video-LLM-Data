That BOMB TD to Evans Had Me and My Sister Absolutely Freaking out With Excitement...When We Tied The Game We Could Not Contain ourselves...When Stafford Hit Krup With The Winning Catch We Were DEVASTATED!....We Lost But it Was a GREAT Sporting Experience
Tom Brady couldn't be that good no one comes into the NFL as a backup quarterback and then doubles the all time record for superbowls like the closest is a couple with six and here Brady is with 10. I am sure after he retires in sometime there will be a huge scandal into how he really succeeded.  What he leaves the Patriots and then at age 44 he wins again.
His last post game interview ever 😓😓😓💔💔💔💔 dam man I never wanted him to retire
In 2004 my cusin made me sit down and watch football before that i didnt like it .  But soon as i saw tom brady payton manning mcnabb i fall in love with football .. after seeing every tom brady season game playoffs this game never will be the same for me .. there's no one comes close not even manning this guy is once in a life time player ! Congratulations brady ! Playoffs it just not gonna be the same with out you ! I feel depressed about him retiring 😞 😢.. but i can say i say i watched the greatest most valuable most perfect qb ever !
Who’s here after he announced his retirement 😌 love touchdown Tommy 🏈   Always ❤️‍🩹
I love how he removed the Gatorade from the podium. He eats super healthy and would never touch that poison. Classy move!
He cherishes his wife and family - great role model for kids, he's a winner not only on the football field.
If Tom does or doesn’t retire, I just want to say, Thank You. Whenever I turn on a game where Tom Brady is involved, it is truly something special to watch. Thank You Tom 🐐
This idiot coach NUKE the Buccaneers
AB made his retirement much easier
This just goes to show you that life is short and this is what you do with your life you get a chance and this is what somebody can do somebody has done in their lifetime it's like words of the poets and the prophets on the subway walls as graffitis
I don't think Tom Brady is going to retire I mean not completely he's probably going to be like Phil Jackson take a year off maybe
Legend & gentleman of the sport 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Todd bowles is the most overrated coordinator in the NFL. Playing zero coverage with little time on the clock ??
Respect from a chiefs fan
Happy retirement sir. You accomplished so much. I hated him at first in the beginning of his career but then cheered him on later in his career.  The nfl will miss you and i will miss watching you play. Always the 🐐
We will miss this man 🐐
The greatest cheat of all time!  GCOAT
He’s retiring cause he has to. Arrested for crimes against humanity. 2019 paid 7.8 million or 15 years in prison for being with children. Belichick fired him. But now he’ll be serving his time. We’ve all been fooled
Can’t win ‘em all just most of them.
GOAT
Watching Brady and Rodgers lose was pure heaven for me. Both are entitled babies with bloated egos.
I honestly think people are over thinking his possibly retirement I honestly think he will be back next season  I mean he had one of the best seasons he has had in a long time statistically this year and I feel he still has the urge to play and can still play at a high level
Bucs Defense just needed one more stop and unfortunately they could not come up with it.
guess he dosnt like Gatorade lol
I swear refs favored the rams same with the chiefs
refs can't do it for you every year tom.
GOOD BYE… RETIRE WE ARE SICK OF SEEING YOU……GO PLAY WITH YOUR HORSE ON YOUR RANCH!
Bucks had an amazing season.  If AB hadn't short circuited and there had been fewer injuries they could have easily been in the super bowl again.  I hope he comes back but I wouldn't count on it.  Last year he said "Oh course I'm coming back."  So he hasn't decided yet or doesn't want to announce his retirement yet.   Either way.
Ever since the divisional round all we hear about is Brady even though there are top notch quarterbacks still playing. What’s up with the idolatry of this guy!? I know his wife is a practicing witch but what kind of spell has he cast on the NFL?! It’s all about him going on 20 years now
Brady needed to come back home for his last season. Get one more ring, and show Mac the ropes of the NE system.
That Rams QB Safford is getting really close to holding that trophy. I think he has really become  the MVP of the league, All those Years in Detroit he never gave up.
When you say the GOAT. In this sport every one knows who you are referring too!
Unfortunately, the loss to the Rams was pretty much on Brady. Tom Brady(G.O.A.T.) wasn't accurate, stayed in the pocket, didn't run when he had open space, and just tried the running game to no avail. The comeback from a 27 - 3 deficit was amazing, but the comeback should've begun in the 2nd quarter instead of the second half. I'm almost sure if they would have gotten pass the Rams, the Buccaneers would have had it easy against San Fran this weekend.
Tu eres único tienes una bella esposa súper modelo famosa no tienes nada que envidiar a nadie tienes belleza carácter .Mahones nada de pesentación no sé que pasa que camina sin estilo
Eres el mejor no hay nadie que sea igual que tú por más que digan Mahones tiene un buen equipo sin el no sería bueno aa un así nos que gane otro anillo será igual tu eres el MVP .
Tom braydi You beatifull
Its always about HIM. 👎
History will say that he is one of the Greatest football player of History of football.
Ha this man is still a front line QB.better than a whole lot of them.come back get a player or two you will win our 8th ring
We ❤️ U GOAT!!
Biggest cheating crybaby in sports history.
I have a question? Was that Brady last game ?
Coming from an ignorant nfl spectator in AUSTRALIA , if any young potential future player isn’t modelling themselves from Tom Brady they got rocks in the head . What a player , what a man 👍🏼
Gatoraid ain't paying him, he hid that quick lol
Incredible season, love ya Tom!
TB. 12 .....doesn't have to answer to use you already seen all the plays.. so what's up get the marbles out of your mouth news reporters.. everybody else talking trash about him. Things that make you go... Hahaha. It is what it is. TB.12.. the best hit the like button stop hating.. everybody on the streets in the homes saying he always wins he always wins.. y'all hit ..... So hit the like button. He's the greatest  .ever play the game 🏈 football TB12
BRADY AND THE BUCANEERS WILL BE BACK TO WIN 🏆  SUPER BOWL  🏈  57TH HE IS A LEGEND! GOD BLESS YOU BRADY. CHUCK,JANICE, LAUREN S.A.F.D.
HE IS LEGEND, AND IS BLESSED 🙌  AND THERE WILL NEVER BE A QUARTER BACK BETTER BRADY, 🙏  THAT REF SHOULD BE  FIRED, HE DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO BRADY, HE IS A LEGEND🏈
Stand up guy!  I’m a huge Bills fan that is a really big T Brady fan! GOAT!  Great Father, husband to his lovely wife..family man!
Sucks his defense blew it!!
Brady is a legend
Tom go enjoy your family sexy wife and $$$$ life is short
GOAT
Tom Never stop playing. Just Never stop. Retire at 50!
One-Of-A-Kind in football!😎
Tom Brady look a like of Justin beiber! Almost identical.
He’s a class act. Great person,teammate, player. The first half was a disaster. Too many mistakes to come back from. Key plays in first half that killed them was the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and after sacking their quarterback and putting them back on their 30 with I think third and 22 something like that they let them throw  a pass for first down. Those two plays did them in. I hope Brady plays next year. He’s a generational player and there won’t be anyone like him to come along for a long time if ever. I loved Montana Jordan Ali and my idol was Seaver. never missed a start while he was a Met. I’m 63 I’ve been lucky enough to see a lot of the greats in my time. Brady certainly one of them.
God bless you TB12.  May the Lord continue to bless you and your family
I love the casual Gatorade removal. TB12 knows that stuff isn't great for you. Drink water!
He said he feels fine physically my take 1 more year is possible how many years did he sign?
Worldwide this guy is an inspiration, hope he goes around again from Australia
Tom Brady has always maintained a high level of class throughout his storied career. People that can't see that are anti-winning.
Patriot fans still love TB12
Don't worry about it Brady you been to 10 super bowls and you got 7 rings, you have nothing to prove I hope you play one more year and win another one
Tom Brady is the only reason I watch the WOKE NFL. When Tom goes the NFL will be history.
Gutted with the result. Ironic that the TD to level it gave the advantage to LA!
He's been a super bowl champion too many times already just retire what more does is he try to do its his fault for bringing in Antonio brown
Shouldn't have cut AB!
The goat comes back next year wins another super bowl crazy 8 he wins every second year.
Now You See You Can’t Win, When You Don’t Cheat. Sorry Not Sorry
I don't think Tom Brady has anything to prove. Even though I and about a million other fans would like him to come back in 2022, he should retire.  And if he does, you can be sure Gronk won't be back either.
RIP Gatorade bottle
SOLD OUT
Ah! I never utilize the terminology you see on the screen Tom. But you are awesomely good! Not averaged EXCELLENCE. But you know, Mr. Brady.
He's  selfish 😒.  Go  away,  let someone  else  win  !  I mean  really  ?
Good greif, never enough for some people. Stay on track, you go this
Brady luvs the Bucs, but will retire as a Patriot. If he only signs for a day or so. GUARANTEE
I don't even watch football unless you're in it Brady I have not watched one thing about football since the loss I'm only watching it cuz you're on it
THE BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
It’s been a privilege living in a Tom Brady era, thanks for all the heart burn and stress.  Wish you the best in your next endeavor.  Hope it’s retirement but hey, your 45 and still playing better than 95% of QB’s period.
A great champion.
Class act
When  BOBBY ORR LEFT THE GAME OF HOCKEY I STOPPED WATCHING HOCKEY..WHEN LARRY BIRD RETIRED FROM THE CELTICS I STOPPED WATCHING BASKETBALL WHEN BRADY LEFT THE PATRIOTS I BECAME A BUCS FAN AND WHEN HE RETIRES FROM FOOTBALL AS A QUARTERBACK THEN I WILL STOP WATCHING FOOTBALL..BUT IF HE BECOMES A COACH I WILL WATCH AND ROOT FOR HIS TEAM
To put down this huge and gigantic quaterback was the only chance to win this game against the baceneers! If he had a chance doing his thing...it would have looked different...for sure!  This season was fun to watsh an full of excitment..looking forward to the super bowl! ! ! I am a fan of tom brady...his way to turn a game is magic...even when a game ends like this...👏👏👏👏👏👏well don mr brady! Keep on rocking!
The positive thing about the bucs losing is Tom will be back,he won't go out like this,had he won the superbowl this year he probably would have retired.Glad the bucs will get one more year of his greatness.Tom ,you are the Greatest Of All Time
"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"
lol they always ask him to compare his losses and wins to others like he’s got them ranked up in his head
Thanks to the New England Patriots for making Tom Brady not Tampa. 🤣🤣
Ahhh .. poor Tom.:(  He couldn't get someone to cheat for him or take the fall, if he got caught cheating again. He'll always be the G.C.O.A.T.
He needs to retire before he his kids are fully grown
Tom and this team are still championship calibur, it would be sad to see him retire. I'd much rather see him make it to the Superbowl one more time! 🐐
There is only one great quarterback and that is Tom Brady.
What a game! Good job guys!
Love the fact he removed the Gatorade too, class Act.
I didn't know we picked up so many injuries during the game geeze. If we don't pick up any more in the off or pre-season I think you're going to see a very angry very vengeful Bucs rip through the league
why do people root against Tampa Tom if not Patriot Tom?? Same person, tho it seems like he got outta shawshank with the Tom and Gronk Episodes
i hope he comes back i love heroes and tom is that
LMMO 😆 Rams !!!!
I’m hearing that Brady may actually retire? Cmon bro, NO - and I’m a Raider’s fan. I get u need talk to the family, I get all that. U need me to talk to them for u? Brady is as much is football as baseball is watching paint dry, errrr I mean apple pie.
Go Bucs!  I think Brady is coming back! 813 all day
When will coaches in the NFL figure out that “prevent” defense never works.
Crazy game
They went out swinging
I'm a Bucs fan!
Thank you Tom Brady for this season🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Dude looks 32 at most
Simply the best
did you guys see how was the first play was 27-3, and he went back on 27-27, where can you find any QB like him did that??? .. He is still the best Quarterback ever, And if he is retiring this coming season, He still the best He win this thing with more superbowl rings most than any player on the history. We love you Tom
He got his face kicked in for 3 quarters and the Rams had some turnovers to make it a game. Big deal. He can barely run 2 miles an hour anymore, that statue was on the ground for much of the game and Jimmy G is going to see the same thing. He got beat down, easily.
this is because arron rodgers didn't get the vaccine somehow
Tom, don't beat your self up at all. Your the goat. You did great, see you next season
love you Tom you are the best
Did they come back or the rams try to give it away
Tom Brady is and always be the goat
Brady lost………lol. Karma came to pay him a visit for all his lefty woke BS. We had a nice celebration, hats off to the Rams!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love you TOM!! Always a fan. 🏈🏈
It was a great season Bucs. Let's get ready for next year.
Go help the Jets or Browns Tom. Don’t retire just yet. Maybe even the Texans or Dolphins.
Tom is so great that the other team makes mistakes that they normally dont make. They know hes in the game and it puts that nervous feeling inside of you. His presence is magic.
I’m a buccaneer, Brady fan, but that being said , I’ll pull for L.A. now.  There quarterbacks career was WASTED in Detroit, so Maby he can now have a chance for glory.    I hope Brady stays for another year, he’s not done yet
You did a tremendous job Tommy. Heck of a game……👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Ha Ha no Brady its back to the same old Buc's  !! Will return to suckville.
The guy just is a class act, nobody's perfect but he's a consumat pro!!!!
Why are there dingbats in the Media pretending that Brady is going to retire when he is coming off a great game even in a loss? The GOAT is still playing at a high level. Something is really special about Brady. He looks like he could play for 10 more years. Now I won't say he will do that because I think he'll eventually retire but I don't think it's anytime soon and I think it's ridiculous that the Media brought it up. Now Big Ben has played like poo for the past couple seasons so It's not shocking people are asking when he will retire but why the heck would someone that is playing like a beast like Brady retire? To say Retire at top is a dumb answer. Brady will leave the sport when he realizes he doesn't have it anymore and if that's at the age of 60 then by god maybe he'll be one of the oldest quarterbacks to play this sport at a high level. Not many are built like Brady. He is special.
Love my BUCS win or lose it's Tampa Bay for Life this season was a hellva ride went down swinging tho next year we coming back
No one seems to admit , Brady and Rogers depend on Flags ! No flags , mediocre outcomes. They are both Great , but nobody’s perfect.
Lame stream media masked up so tight can barely hear them...smh
He’s got about 8, maybe 10, more seasons in him.
Press sucks. Hey Brady are you throwing in the towel yet? Thinking about giving up? Close enough to those words.  At least Brady handled it with class.
Brady played a heck of a game -- he did come through and made a huge comeback in the end. Unfortunately, the defense took a nap in the final minute enough for that Rams´ dude just walk through, made a play enough for a field goal. Gut-wrenching...
Tom is the goat he should play until he is 50.
MVP Better season than Rogers. Lost key players and still almost did it. Still the king.
Who cares
Tom Will be back no doubt. Plus. You never stop till the clock hit 0:00 then you stop
Respect 🏈 for Brady, for the entire team 👍 regardless if you’re a Tom Brady/Bucs fan or just overall a NFL fan, this Man is the Greatest Player that ever played this game ✌️ Just appreciate and enjoy the fact that Brady is still playing at a high level coz we won’t see anyone like him once he retires 🏈 Respect
Offensive line would have given TB an extra 45-60 seconds throughout the game would have allowed him more time to complete the passes. That was the killer.
They'll improve and Brady will retire next season after hoisting the Lombardi trophy once more.
The secondary safety get rid of them all quit talking about Brady it's on the defense I hope everyone else see this besides me
I'm here to laugh at the bandwagons
Tom Brady come and join the raiders 😎
Cant win em all. I feel like he's coming back for one more and Tampa will go all in for one last ride with Brady. He deserves it for them to dedicate all resources for next year even if it means mortgaging the future. You have the greatest to ever play still playing at an incredibly high level, Tampa won't ever have this good of an opportunity to win it all again, with the best ever leading the charge for a final ride.
Honestly, how many Brady haters out there had to change their undershorts when the Bucs tied it at 27 ?
Losses still hurt this man like he has the desire to keep playing. Biggest question is his wife and kids. I would bet next year will be his last no matter what.
Regardless of how you feel about this man, Tom is the GOAT !
#40 on trending
Frick Gatorade!! lol
We will be back stronger 💪
Brady was never the same after the vaccine. Bad performance this year
Smoking that brady pack!!!
Brady is not done…. I see it in his mannerism and calmness but he’s boiling inside I sense it from him
Tom Brady is the goat
L
I love his answers when they kept hounding him about if hes retiring or not.  He's thinking about how it could have gone different and then he gets better next time. Smartest Person on the field and in life!
The bucs should have never wasted their money on AB he contributed to the loss. This could’ve been legendary for Brady. I hope he comes back at least for one more season and gets one last ring unless it’s the dallas cowboys.  I’m a dallas cowboy fan. But also a fan of Tom Brady
What a great season it wasn't a big one but we know you got another season for us go buccaneers all the way no matter what we are still number one anyway you look at it go Brady and team all the way I'll be waiting next year to watch
Tom will be back. He’s a winner and he will go out on a win.
He's so good he's heated by lots people!!! The legend lost!! Better luck next year!!!!
He'll be back next year and  better then ever  rams may have won but it could've easily ended with a bucs win.  point is rams dodged a bullet. And they should't get cocky going forward  nevertheless im proud of how my bucs played regardless  hard fought game till the end.
Well he'll be playing in the NFL until he's 60 lol.
Clone wife a witch
Man, he despises losing  that mindset  is his life no moral victories here
O THANK GOD FINALY A TOM BRADY FREE SUPER BOWL . I HOPE HE GETS FIRED OR RETIRES .
I'm picking up a funky vibe.
You can tell in the way he says and words things, HE WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR!!!! Unless he decides to go somewhere else again! Either way, it’s every other year and he’s in or winning The Super Bowl!!!!
Amazing composure.
Great job Tom and team! That was a great game.  We are proud of you all!
I see right through this. So fake
It's scripted.  Jig is up retire
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  John 3:16
Gracias Tom Brady !!
As a patriots fan and all the conspiracy theory’s of them cheating, I’m happy the chat isn’t talking about bad stuff about him
Thanks Tom brady.. I witness the greatness in you.. A very humble and class act player.. Hate him or love him he win it or lose the game but no one can surpass his greatness and his indiviual achievements.. Always acknowledge a team effort and a very unselfish person..
Them kickers only have one job!
I hope to watch him play again!!! He is the man!
TB did not let fans down one bit. They played a fine, exciting season! 👍 If I were team management, I wouldn’t do a rebuilding next year. There’s only one position that needs to be filled since he walked off the field in the middle of a game.
Brady is in the twilight of his career and he knows he doesn't have many more chances to win it all.  Of course this hurts, it could be the last time he plays or if he plays, this could be the last time he gets this far into the playoffs.  Tampa came out flat and it took them 3 quarters to figure anything out.  The Rams did what they needed to do and they played a better end to end game.
This game was a classic Brady comeback. So close after coming from so far behind. Win or lose I love watching Tom's talent, dedication to his craft and ultra competitive nature.
Thanks to Antonio brown leaven! Brady didn't have no good reciver
Some high level questions by these reporters......
He's got one more year in him. Dudes only 44 he can't retire yet.
Todd Bowles blitzing constantly was the dumbest call throughout the whole game.
The GOAT. Regardless Brady is a national treasure.
TB is still the man; no doubt. The greatest QB; no doubt.
Love you Tommy!!! The GOAT in all sports
Tbh that first pass to cupp in the final drive by the rams wasn’t out of bounds i rewatched it a bunch of times on the nfl app. I’d love to see it from a different angle but from the angle I saw it from it honestly didn’t look out of bounds and that one play changed the entire out look on the game. Had they ruled that in bounds the clock would have kept ticking and they probs woulda had to use a time out so the next play would have had to been on the side line to get out of bounds to kick a FG but great game none the less
As a die hard Bucs fan, thank you for everything Tom. You’ve done so much for the city and the franchise. I pray that you come back for one more run. Whatever you choose, you choose, and I will support you no matter what.
This loss is on Bruce Arians.
This Leader is respected & admired everywhere. Thanks GOAT Tom Brady. Greetings 🇨🇭
Interesting that Tom refused to answer the question about the unsportsmanlike penalty because, if he did, he might be fined. Any fine the league imposed would be a drop in the bucket given his football and non-football income, and they can’t suspend him for this season because his season is over, so hopefully Tom is thinking that he can’t jeopardize next season by getting a suspension. I hope there is a next season with the Bucs for him.
TAMPA DEFENSE IS DISGUSTING
I doubt this is it
Played like champions
why did bucs pick that thumbnail?!. hahaha. hahahaha.
Amazing resilience by a the Bucs. Nothing went their way in the first half. Offensive line injured and besides Mike Evans, the remaining WRs playing in the game had a total of 100 yards COMBINED this year. Thank you Bucs and Tom Brady for another incredible season!
Bowles took the football away from Brady with horrible defensive scheme in the end. I have no doubts they win that game in overtime.
Breaking news. Tom Brady is gonna announce retirement soon. Thanks for the memories goat
Wondering what the outcome would have been if Antonio Brown played in the game?
But hey at least you guys made to the playoffs.
Selfishly I hope he doesn’t retire. I’ve been watching the NFL for 58 years and I’ve never seen anyone that even comes close to Brady in so many categories. He is the GOAT.
If I could earn a few million for working an hour or so every weekend for half the year, I wouldn't quit.
Why I love Tom Brady.  Did you see him remove the bottle of poison from the rostrum?
Even his enemies love him---What a guy!
I love u Brad please come back next year..
Convenient scripted turnovers just like SB 51
As a Patriots fan I miss this guy. He really is the GOAT.
You should be able to bash the refs without getting fined.  The guy slammed the top of his helmet into his chin FFS, and that idiot ref suddenly goes blind?
What a privilege watching you Tom!  Thanks for the memories, regardless of retirement choice!!
Nobody would know the coaches name had it not been for Tom Brady. All you TB fans need to wake up and face REALITY! no front line to protect him means no St. Brady! All the new QB's have no front line and still manage to win! Wake up! Josh and Mahomes know how to SCRAMBLE.! Brady cant RUN!!! LOL
Brady was Great. The defence SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The  DB MUST GO AWAY. !!!!!!!!!!! You gave the Game away..
Head off for the whole team . very proud of the team
I can’t believe the call man. Blitz and leave their best wr in a 1on 1 against your safety in the most crucial part of the game. I just don’t understand 😐
If we where full strength we would have bet them easy
Like him or hate him but Antonio Brown was the missing component yesterday. Tampa would have won if AB was in the game.
NFL is WWE without the admittance. Enjoy it like a good movie.
Only Quarterback to get caught cheating We can say most of his championships are not validate due to not knowing how many games he/they cheated!!!! FACTS
First Thank You Tampa Buccaneers for a great season. Obviously we all wish it wasn’t over but you guys all showed huge heart playing through all the injuries and tough times. And Thank You to Tom Brady for all your class and leadership. You show not only your teammates but anybody who watches football what a true quality human being is.
If anyone can score two touchdowns in 4 minutes it's Tom Brady -a text message I sent to my sister before Brady scored two touchdowns in 3 minutes
He is so amazing. He even caught the Gatoreade bottle in front of him and moved it.
This guys should be every guys role model. I can't say one bad thing about him and the fact that in his 22 year carreer noones come out with any negative dirt. Defines the kind of guy this man is true legend. I'm thankful for all he's given the game and fans true goat no question...the fact that game ended and then buffalo and kansas city ended the way it did , to me the way mahomes and Allen performed that was the passing of torch...
One of those crying yt boys who didn’t get his way lol
I hope that puts an end to "Todd Bowles should be a head coach" That defense was a cluster fook all day.  Can't even play "Tampa" two correctly.  The GD defense was invented in Tampa.
:-(
Ask Rob. Know Rob.
So sad bucs lose the game . Love Tom Brady
Tom Brady Clothes line Made In The USA or made overseas China ? Anyone know ?
Brady. ✨🐐✨
Bucs will be trash after Brady retires and all the bandwagons will leave tampa never had all them fans until Brady bye
Now Brady and Rogers can go fishing together. Good riddance.
The look on his face when asked about the ref exchange he had says it all about how much he hates to lose and how truly competitive he is
I'll always root for the Chiefs, but I hope Brady and Rodgers stick around for a few more years...No one will catch Brady's SB wins...
Good riddance !  we don't need another Brady superbowl !
Two goals, care about your teammates and care about winning everything else you have to put aside. Can’t help but wonder if that was directed to AB.
G.O.A.T.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Please come back for another year.
Been a bucs fan for a while ever since I got into football which was back in 2013, Brady coming on a debut season with a superbowl win is a miracle for our team and hopefully when he retires it can at least give our team a little boost of having a strong team still.
Much to the GOAT and the team. The comeback they organized was amazing, it did not worked out the way any of us wanted it, but that's the game.
What a comeback.. Tough start to the game.. Tom and company nearly produced another miracle.. I wish he had but I was impressed none the less..
((d|-(<O>)-| |-(<O>)-|b))  ®   /,|<0> | <0>|,\   You still R the GOAT to us..
You always have Heart .. For yourself and the BUCS. As a Fan the feeling is Mutual I'm down and out for you guys. I think you guys killed it last two quarters. I'm proud of you 👏💯 congratulations to a wonderful season and Tom have Nice time with your family. Enjoy
Keep your head up Brady and bucs. Great year lots of key players were hurt u fought hard great season
Honestly I was upset but I’m so proud of the fight we showed in the end! We almost came back and had them…it was a shame we didn’t have Wirfs that game.
No one’s perfect and at the end of the day it’s only a game. My goodness Tom Brady it s such a standup guy and family man!
love you sweet guy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We have to play better next year  stop the slow starts and playing from being offensive line was not good at all take this time to reflect and fix the bad and improve the good...TB12 will be back this is Florida not New England
Really good game
Still the goat
As a huge Bucs fan.. that was so hard of a loss when we came back at the end.. We were all running and jumping and hugging. Then the rams 2 shots down field in absolutely no time, it was such a gut punch. Long love the GOAT no matter what he decides.. Thank u so much Tom! I will never forget last years superbowl road and how it was impossible.. but we did it!
Losing by scratch with Injured OL against Aaron Donald , Von Miller and non existent secondary against Kupp and OBJ is nothing but remarkable ! Tough loss
Still he most of the time do it well, anyways I decided to give Patriots 2018 final against Eagles because during the game nielegalne okrzyki West Pointu były używane, oni wiedzieli o mojej obecności w USA w tamtym momencie bylem w Trenton w barze Parti demokratycznej, w kluczowym momencie gdy Patriots byli w ataku dokładnie w momencie gdy Wiśniewski coś tam zrobił został użyty okrzyk ❗ baczność tenhuth który kofudował QB w związku z moją obecnością w USA, takie zagrania są dozwolone podczas gry w baseball i to poza stadionem a nie podczas Super Bawl, sprawa wygląda tak że jest to połączone z konspiracja która odbywa się we wsi Bratkowice gdzie mieszka mój szwagier notabene rodzina Toma Brady'ego oraz rodzina Wiśniewskiego która mieszka na nielegalnie wykonanym domu ze względu na brak zezwolenia na budowę na cudzym polu. Cała sprawa jest druzgocąca dla sytuacji rodzinnej mojej siostry która jest w stanie zrozumieć dlaczego rozeszła się z Damianem Kujda. Sprawa powinna zostać opisana w mediach ponieważ dotyczy ona nie tylko Footbolu oraz spraw nielegalnych zalieszkan czytaj holocaust ale również całej globalnej spławy przeciwników NWO. Tom wiem że i tak masz wiele piersieci ale nie zdziw się jak ten za 2018 jakoś trafi w twoje ręce tak samo jak puchar bo masz do niego prawo zakorzenione w podświadomości byłem wtedy w USA i jak normalnie staram się nie ingerować w Football to tego dnia wiedziałem że stanie się coś złego i poszedłem oglądać, potem wróciłem do Polski poszedłem do pracy i przestałem tam pracować z okazji hanuki, wczoraj zaczolem się coś interesować ta sprawa i okazało się że osoba która mieszka w Bratkowice oraz ten Wiśniewski wyglądają identycznie, to jest niedozwolone z uwagi na ekonomię oraz sprawy rodzinne. Proszę NFL o wzięcie mnie za dowód w sprawie o zwrócenie trofeum oraz pierścieni oraz uiszczenia opłaty zwrotnej za nielegalne zachowanie oraz negatywny wpływ na postrzeganie ludzi z Bratkowic przez moją rodzinę  co w efekcie odbija się na dzieciach, dodam ten z Bratkowic La głuche dziecko za to ma a wy go jeszcze za mój budżet nagradzacie opieka. Sprawa jest poważna i warto by było aby zostało to opisane chociaż bo ten to nie tylko Kongo.
One of the greatest of all times and humble heart!
I wanna not feel bad for this guy lol. But he really is the BEST! 🤦‍♂️
the rams tried to give it away             nice penalty brady got        the refs know your not bigger than the game           when you retire     the nfl goes on
I think he should retire, lots of question marks on that Bucs team.
Comparing that to the Atlanta game is hilarious Atlanta didnt fumble four times.
What a diva first thing he does is remove the Gatorade lol if it was some concussion water or something him and his snake oil salesmen are selling he would have it front and center.
It's all good next we taking it injuries play against us and finally caught up too us 💫💫💫💫💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💯💯💯
I LOVE YOU TOM.B...SORRY FOR THE LOSS . YOU DID GREAT.
Tom should go to Seattle and win his last superbowl with a 3rd team. Never done before.
The only thing that saved the Rams was going up 27-3 instead of 28-3.
I think its time to retire for goat
Love how the nfl has everyone by the balls. Cant say anything or you'll probably get fined.
Tom will end his career with 8 rings we saw him come back with a broken bucs team next year is his year
Just not our year
Cowardly Ram coaching let them back in the game. With a big lead, the coach decided to play safe and was lucky to win. Happy for Stafford.
Both the O and D-line was not up to par today. They did make some plays but not enough. Will be interesting to see if Tom is back next year.
Hope he comes back of course but we only played for 1Q. Very tough schedule next season but the changes in the team could actually freshen it up .Godwin,Cap should be the priorities. Secondary needs some strengthening
Rams played well
Spanked hard
Lol
Tom? You’re still the best!
We love you tom
Thanks for posting Tom you the best will never be the same if you quit good luck next year
He will come back he looks healthy
Win or lose, Brady is a grown man.
TB12 what a devastating  loss. Antoine Windfield Jr I wish you would have been there to deny Kupp but a lot of things obviously could have went some much better and different. What a bitter loss after all the momentum change
Retire. No way he wins another Super Bowl. It will just be heartbreak after heartbreak.
Take notes, Brady is the face of the NFL, a class act.
Both him and Gronk will retire
🐏
Just could not keep guys healthy and having your line compromised in the playoffs isn’t great - didn’t play well and there you have it
At least he showed up
Brady is still the GOAT..great season..with all those injuries..and AB screwing the team over..still great job..go BUCS ❤️ forever!
Tom Brady needs to put soul into the ball , not slow into the ball.  Too short - touch then no down - too slow. Was Joe Biden there ?
Only is ONE G O A T
Tom we love you so much! Thank you for a legendary last season another amazing run this year. You're amazing man, I can't thank you enough for what you've done for this team! Beyond thankful and no words!
This guy is a total class act...and he's 44!!...can't believe he still gets hate, jealousy is such a bad trait
Brady has to be proud, Even though he's not, He did his job 100%. He put them in position to win and the Defense fukked it up Period !!!!!!!!!
One play cooper cupp that was the game a deep pass
Losing Godwin was the difference
Brady is 44 yrs. Old. And he is still a great quarterback!! Even better then most good quarterbacks in the league. Please keep playing!!
Clearly last year they won because of AB not Tom smh
What’s his contract situation?
I'm a huge Tom Brady fan and the whole Buccaneers Team. What an impressive 👏👌🙌 comeback in just few minutes away before the end of the  4th quarter.  We, the fans were so happy and ecstatic watching him what he does best. Watching the highlights was so fun to watch and the crowd. WOW!! Thank you Tom Brady, my NFL Quarterback of all time!! Good luck on whatever you want to pursue after the Sunday's game.
"Tom do you plan on retiring after this season"?  Tom Brady "Winning"
GOAT proving all his wisdom in 5 minute interview. Such composure, such intelligence. Great to see. 👍👏  Better luck next year, Brady!
"Way too many mistakes"  True, that about sums up that game, on both sides mind you.  But what a comeback it was. Only GOAT can give NFL audience this kind of matches.
who said it was a great season?no last year was a great season all the injury bs tom had to endure throughout the year
It's been an honor sir Thomas.
Can't end now.  He can't retire after the second half he gave us!!  See you next year, Brady!
He literaly played against a 'Dream Team' because the Rams is loaded with all star players and he almost got the W at the age which is impressive af.
No reason to retire. I have watched many NFL videos, but never seen a TB "in the clutch delivery comeback" live. This was one, it was great even if the team struggled for 3 quarters, and finally not being glorious. Some strange and bad luck situations in bucs defense and offense took the Rams to the win.
The Gatorade didn’t deserve that
Thank you Tom and team. You guys did a great job. We appreciate you all for making this a great season even with all the injuries.
Tom will come back if Edelmen joins him. :)
For me the NFL will never be the same when Brady retires.
It was an awesome season. Despite all the injuries, they came this far. Proud to be a Bucs fan.
With all the rams turnovers Tampa should be ashamed they didn't win
I never in a thousand years would have ever believed it? But the NFL is fricken "RIGGED" from players and coaches to entire organizations they're all involved! Refs is a given💯 Now that I 👀 @it! Antonio Brown's exit was a pre planned or paid? Maybe a blackmailed💉coordinated effort👫👬👭 His ankle injury is BS! Just like the meme he put out after the game💯 Entertainment via confrontation = REVENUE $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  WATCH👀 Bengals will beat the chiefs considering the new "Poster Burrow" And Stafford will get his💍in LA💥

Bye bye Tommy traitor...could've happened to a better traitor...
Thank you Bucs for a very good season. Helped make my year. Great comeback too.
He's leaving
Unfortunately  the first half put them on the back foot. But to fight back the way the TEAM did was nothing short of epic and a true testament to how this team has grown. TB12 is a true legend, team player and gracious in defeat. NO Doubt he is the G.O.A.T , hopefully not his last season. But look forward to seeing what he does with his career both off and on the field.
Brady throwing shade on that Gatorade bottle.
We had WAY TOO MANY INJURIES & DEWs were against the Bucs. Cmon Tom don’t listen to your mind listen to your heart, PLEASE come back for 2 more years. Most people work til their 60s and you have this unbelievable opportunity to keep playing , please come back strong 🙏
The bucs, hahahahahahahahahaha
Tom ain’t leaving
🤔Guess they needed AB after all, should of helped AB get that bag 💰 now it costs a championship🏆 🙄 😒
He schould retire next season Bucs will not be near like this.
Tom...your amazing....sorry you lost today.....hope to see you next year. Hugs ...grew up in San Francisco...in Ireland 9 years  All the best
some of the worst ref calls ive ever seen in my life. that on top of all the injuries we had its amazing how far we managed to make it. looking forward to next season
Huge bucs fan here, so happy that the major comeback happened, im so happy that i get to watch this team play, love you all
it was so much fun watching the bucs come back from 27-3. heartbreaking to lose how we did after that. still love what tom brady has done for my team and im so excited for next season!!!
anyone notice he took the gatorade bottle out the way 👀👀
Please be proud!  You all faced so much injury and adversity....and still you fought so hard.  I was so proud of the team today!!!!!! Love you guys
Tom Brady did all he can do gotta give him props for the effort
It doesn’t feel right when he’s not in the super bowl it hurts so bad
This guy is such a competitor. You can tell he's seething underneath all his composure.
Bucs will come back. But after what Arian’s did to AB, this was well deserved
The saddest part about the bucs season is that they brought everybody back and we never saw them all play in 1 one game together. I still think this was the best roster ever put together just sad we didn't get to prove it this year.
Thank you Tampa Bay Buccaneers, we have nothing but love for you guys. We lost, it hurts, my energy and love for my Bucs will never change. Anyday we hit that field they fear and respect us. LA and New Orleans we will meet again.
Wow! So close!!! Bucs did everything they could in the end to win but it was just too many mistakes in the beginning cost them in the end! Yes the defense missed two big tackles on Kupp but it all started from the slow start and bad plays on all sides of the ball! I pray Brady tries one more time and comes back to the Bucs and they stay mostly healthy and win Brady's 8th!!!
Tom Brady retire already your to old...
Brady seems relieved/over it quickly. I'm kind of shocked
What a season - you guys killed it even with a skeleton crew coming on to play with you guys. I honestly thought this was going to be a comeback story of a game, and I'm heartbroken to see this team and these guys miss the chance to repeat Super Bowls - and I KNOW if everyone had been healthy and playing up to their abilities, NO ONE could have beaten the Bucs. PERIOD. But I pray this loss fuels TB12's burning competitive fire enough to get him back for one more season (along with Gronk) so they can get another ring that is BEYOND well deserved. Nothing but love and support for all my Bucs! We still raising the flags!!!!!!!! We support you guys!
It just seems like the fire wasn’t there in his eyes today. Still the GOAT.
Ironic thing is I heard that Brady would have retired if he beat the Giants and got that perfect season. Thankfully he lost that game and got 4 more rings.
They'll be back next year!
This is sport… win and loss… move-on… still bucs! Still a GOAT… I’m waiting for the nxt season
Great to see the refs standing up to Tom Brady
Brady has another 10 years in him!
Was anyone surprised that they didn't go for the 2 pt conversion to win it, rather than take a chance on the coin toss in OT?
The WR core had no Pop.   Thank Bruce Arians.
Still the 🐐
Brady didn't lose. The Bucs did.
Fire Bruce Arians.
Cue the haters. Send in the clowns. Tom will forever live rent free in your pathetic little minds. Long after you are worm food, Tom will still be a household name while your grandchildren won’t remember yours. Truly a heroic performance and a fighter to the end.
Be Proud Tom, you hang in there until the end.  Great season
Thanks ab. Thanks Todd bowles.thanks o line for ending the season
It would be CRAZY if he and Rodgers quit, in the same year as Ben R. Truly a changing of the guard
Thanks defence for ending our season
Wish the offense and defense had played alot better the first half. Hopefully you guys will be back next year.
Can’t win ‘em all, Tom. Though you certainly try! You’re still awesome
Bruh I looked at the comments on an Aaron Rogers video (talking about when he lost against the 49ers) and I saw nothing but negative comments but in this MF comment section positive asf like nah g
Selfishly I hope he doesn’t retire. I’ve been watching the NFL for 58 years and I’ve never seen anyone that even comes close to Brady in so many categories. He is the GOAT.
Tom Brady isn't gonna retire. Tom Brady led the league in passing yards and touchdowns and made the Pro Bowl. Tom Brady ain't going no where baby
Tod Bowles should be fired right NOW
Thank you Tom Brady for what you have done for Tampa Bay. Really hope you don't retire
Bucs will be coming back next year.🏆🏆
You are already amazing man. You played better than last year, this loss is not on you. Great comeback.
If the Bucs had a healthy Oline they would have destroyed the rams
Legacy already set in stone, Tom Brady the 🐐
We died standing...that's my bucs
IM GOING TO NEED THE SAME ENERGY LIKE YOU WON EVEN THO YALL LOST  THAT'S A REAL LEADER OF MEN
All the best with retirement.
respect
LEGION OF THE BRADY 12, THATS WHO WE ARE! GO TB12 GO! 💯
Should have gone for that extra point Tom! That big comeback to hand them an opportunity like that is nonsense. The Rams down by 1 with 35 seconds left would have been a very different team than the Rams tied with 35 seconds left. Bucs didn’t want to look bad if they made the wrong decision, but that’s the risk you should have taken, because that’s always the right decision, win or lose on your own terms, not the opponent’s.
We put up such a fight man, heartbreaking 💔 😢 😔
Fix that secondary lol
Tom Brady’s like I’m sure it’s hard to be a safety cause I destroy them every game
Rams did everything they could to almost choke.
Tom Brady looks like he wants to hit that safety that blew his coverage and loss them the game
Tom, stay active and retire after Rodgers disappears.  Just saying. 🥶😬🙄
If we're not eating, Brady not eating, GO RAMS & Patriots‼👏🏿😁 🏈
Hopefully Tom will be back next year! He's a thrill to watch! There will never be another Quarterback like Tom Brady The G.O.A.T!
Tom said it perfect, this sucks!!!  The comeback was phenomenal and there's no way we should have lost. I'm devastated for real!
PLEASE DONT LEAVE TB!!
Buccs fans desperate not to be the gutter team before tom came along
It was rigged!
simply the G.O.A.T
I hope you keep playing Tom.  I know your efforts make many ppl feel good about themselves.
should of treated antonio brown better
This actually really sad this game could be tb 12 last game. But definitely was fun  to watch tb 12 44 throw like he was 24. Thank you for 2 amazing years
This can’t be the end. I refuse to believe that this is the end. Not after the season he’s had. Not after how well he’s played. Still never got to see him play in person and I really should have gone.
Tom Brady still da 🐐
Ram's vs KC
Brady let go for one more season!! Let get the last ring before your retirement!!! We got this next season
Super team wasn't so super.🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been a fan of Brady’s since ‘06 and I’m truly gonna miss him on the field but this  Coach doesn’t deserve him and Brady doesn’t deserve a Coach like Arians he’s ungrateful and doesn’t give his players any credit, Brady doesn’t need him But he (Arians) needs Brady
Tom. GOAT. Thats just the truth.
I guess he doesn't like Gatorade 🤷
The goat bit his own face and cried about it to the ref
The defense got that key turnover which was amazing. But how you get beat deep and give up two big plays to let them in field goal range in 37 seconds is mind boggling. I mean come on man, that was just horrendous defense.
Defense was flat all day. Not ready for the game. Tom did great as did the offense.
Missing so many starters and still almost pulled it off. That’s the goat
That thumbnail lol
🐐
does that mean there season is over
Rams 1st half MVP:  Shawn Hochuli
Not a gatorade fan...
i'm conflicted too.  and because, old as you are, excuse me, i'm 65, but i remember being tired of baseball, round my 40's.  but in you i still see tremendous passion and that is so cool, so just make up your mind and do what you do.  you are beautiful
Bucs fans feeling better now after that bills-chiefs game
for a lot of these Bucs losing these playoff games can be crushing, for Brady winning / losing in the playoffs has been his entire career. He's won and lost in the biggest moments consistently for 20 years. He'll be back for 1 more!
What a quitter
love to brady.  i have no right say.  u like frank do it your way, but, i feel, be with your family.  i know for a fact, tell truth, you could play to 50.  weigh it out and i know you will but now you know my vote.  love you goat.
Cover 0 Blitz . Todd Bowles at his finest. Terrible play call.
Overrated, time to retire.
Well Tom,maybe you wont 3peat but beat your old mentors record of 8
I’d ratha stay blown out then to lose like this
Succop makes that field goal they win
What a game!!  As a Brady fan, it was so hard to watch. I almost turned it off but am so glad I didn’t.  Bucs did a great job coming back.  Kudos to the Rams but I think the Bucs played a heck of a great game and hopefully saw how resilient they are.  They were really short-handed but still came really close. So proud of what the Bucs achieved. Thank you!!  👍
That’ll be 30 cases of dew skip Bayless haaaaaa 😂
Tom is done and he doesn't want to face it
BA needed AB out there 😁
Tom Brady is big reason for me to watch NFL . Hopefully I still could see Tom Brady next season 🙏🙏
Guess they needed Antonio Brown
He needs to call it quits. At this point it's not brady who is winning  these games.
Nothing short of a legend
Brady sounds so much like bill after games sometimes sucks we lost proud they performed even with all the injuries
He ain’t trippin Giselle bout give this man a flight to Boston with Olympic speed while she on them strong knees of hers
He's healthy
TB12 = G.O.A.T.  The vacuum he will leave will not be filled in mine or many more lifetimes from now.
I have been watching you for so many years. I will always cheer for you guys,don't matter what...
Brady, keep playing. You owe it to all to see just how long you can go.
Sucks losing Brown & Godwin. Rams are a great team
Thank you, Tommy. It’s been a blessing watching you. The Rams D-line was tough. I bet Tom is sore and in pain next week. Please retire before you get hurt. 🙏🏽❤️
That one more play than you guys was Matthew Stafford. Just goes to show you that Stafford was held back from doing good things in Detroit.
You really let us down. Hopefully the 49ers or the Bengals can take it all.
Anyone but Brady. Doesn't belong in pro football. He's a cheat and I hope he's done.
1st undertaker retired last year now Brady. There goes my connection to my youth.
PLEASE DONT RETIRE. ONE MORE YEAR!
Please retire
Living Legend!!
Please play one more year with Gronk....and fire 65 useless...the weakest link.  went around him all game long ...
I applaud this man.  He is 45 years old more than excelling in the NFL. Wow jus wow
GOAT! Grande profissional ! 💯🏉🇧🇷
One of the worst performances of the goat's life. Pathetic really.
Brady, as reigning champs, ya'll showed heart and tenacity...being down and fighting your way back to give yourself a chance was epic. Nothing to hang your head down about, it's been a rough year, but even in all that y'all ended up winning your div and the 2 seed..I hope you will return but family is the most important. Whatever you do, you're a winner...continue to win in life as well.....
If we had Antonio Brown we would have made it to the super bowl but the head coach wanted to feel like a big shot.
I hope Brady retires now
This one’s tough
If this was it,  we'll never see anything like it again.
Such class.  I wish all losing QBs interviewed like this after tough playoff losses.  There are some pouty ones in this league, that's for sure.
The goat
Gotta make them field goals!!
Why they be acting like they don’t drink Gatorade.
GOAT
To me, It feels like we lost that game twice.
I was never a Brady fan til he came to the Bucs. It's impossible not to admire the passion this man has for the game. Thanks Tom for bringing life to the Bucs.
Go away and take Gronk with you.
How you cover Kupp with just a safety on the most important play of the game is beyond me. It was the only thing that could beat you in regulation. And it did.
Don’t retire GOAT! Come back for one more year and if he does man it’s been an honor and privilege to see him play! Win or lose he’s the greatest of all time!
What a season. Bucs kept their Super-Bowl-winning roster intact, only to have a bunch of them fall away with injuries. "Next man up" became the mantra, and week after week this team cobbled together a group of starters and a plan to win, and went 13-4. Regardless of the playoff outcome, they were an inspiration, a lesson in perseverance and true grit. I'm very proud of the 2021 Bucs.
Goat man! Almost led the second biggest comeback after the atl comeback but our genius dc blitzed and left kupp 1 on 1  3 different times this game & so many other mistakes but great game! One more year Brady!
One more set of good hands and we would of ran over the Rams. Our wanna be star coach told him to get the F off the field. Coach change
Go Bucs! See ya next year!
Brady thanks for the memories. I'm grateful for having the privilege to watch your entire career. You're the GOAT 🐐 and a living legend.
I think Brady will be back. I hope the coach won't.
The fact that it came down to that last play was a true testament of the quality and grit of everyone on the team...I am a BUCS fan and had the game on a blowout when they announced #78 was OUT, Gronk had to block for Wells sooooooo many times, reducing the offensive playbook even further ...and they STILL came back and almost got it done...What a game !!! Lost HUGE as a BUCS fan, won some coin on betting so a small consolation...Don't think everyone will make it back but it was fun while it lasted...                                 <<<<<<<<<LET'S GO BUCS >>>>>>>> SB LVII
Love you TB12! CLASS ACT!
Should kept A.B.
Tom after a loss owned up aa Ron blamed special teams immediately
I think he will come back. Bucs gonna make another run next season watch
Was all about the opening run from Chargers and the Miss block
As far as I'm concerned when he retires they should just discontinue football.
The 🐐 needs to punch all his coaches in the face for not having a safety with 28 seconds left and no time outs for the rams. Unbelievable
Amazing, true leader!!
Tom Brady holds all the NFL quarterback records he might play a full year if part of the year telling you he wants to be with his kids watching grow up
Todd bowles your days are numbered
He's not done! Just watch! He'll be back! Good season fellas! 🤙 GO BUCS!!
He sounds just like Bill
Blame the kicker who missed the 3 points would have made a world of difference. A kicker lost it for the goat
Thanks Tom brady.. I witness the greatness in you.. A very humble and class act player.. Hate him or love him he win it or lose the game but no one can surpass his greatness and his indiviual achievements.. Always acknowledge a team effort and a very unselfish person..
I feel he will be back. He loves our team. Remember, he chose us! We love and respect you Tom! Go Bucs. Go Team.
Brady is nfl!!!
Why does Tom never know what down it is. lol. Do us all a favor and retire. Did the film crew record the practice for you well enough. Did they miss anything?
They lost because they wanted to. Disappointing game.
TIME FOR THE GABBERT ERA
Both teams played their hearts out……next TB
WOW the Bucs were flippin amazing coming back to tie the game!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!😳😳
amazing when you don't get 47 calls a quarter what happens
Brady still a top five quarterback
TB12 not a Gatorade advocate...😀😀😀
Time to speak to Aaron Rogers’s agent
Christ, the guy was 3 points from making the second biggest comeback of Football history. Amazing considering he's already played the Biggest Comeback in NFL history.  Man, what a football game.
they lost with 4 seconds left by a field goal. Please don't retire GOAT!
My heart will break if he doesn't return next year. I'm hoping he will return and sign a great WR too and win 8th.
Too big an ego to retire, he'll have to break his arm or leg to retire. Or maybe Gisele will walk.
Master
Hate to say it but having AB would have been nice but id still rather see them lose w/out him than put up w/his BS and I think missing the other recievers had as much as a impact also. Also all the other players.
The way he nonchalantly grabs the Gatorade and hides it from view in the beginning. He's ultra-aware of the brands he represents intentionally and otherwise.
At this point Brady is simply playing for the love of the game... no other reason, he is beyond the greatest of all time, its not even comparable, let him play until he chooses he has had enough.
🏆
If Tom does come back, maybe Bucs needs a new HC?
Tom Brady will not retire on a L. He will be back. 🐐
If by “the goat” you mean Greatest of all Teeth, yeah, you are 100% right 👍🏻😂
He should be very proud and all the Bucs!!!
I wish Todd and Byron would have put the interviews off until after the playoffs. I blame Bruce for not telling them it needed to wait. It was obvious the gameplan was not set up very well and alot of play calls left me scratching my head! AB betraying him a few weeks ago? Guys dropping like Flys? Nobody could stay healthy.... Todd Bowles leaving Kupp wide open with a chance to go to overtime? Tom did what he could but this is on everybody else not putting in the work that would have let them earn it. Today he could not throw past 5 yards without getting popped, he had very little time to throw most of the time.. A sad day for the game of football.
Come back next year Best quarterback of all time Glad we get to see him his whole career
Class act. That he's even doing what he's doing at his age is nothing short of epic. Huge respect.
I’m a Rams fan and a Tom Brady fan too.  I’m happy the Rams won but I think Brady will be back.
LoL 🤣 get that Gatorade out of here ! They're not paying me!
Go bucs
Brady baby. Long live the king.
He is the GOAT.
I'll guess he goes one more season. He ain't going out like dat!
That secondary 🗑️
Rams have a better luck than Bucs this game. See Bucs go to a superbowl again next year. 🏈💥🎊🎉
its a honor to root for this man!!!!!!!!
The calls by the ref were trash
Thank you Tom Brady you are a Hero a Legend the GOAT ❤️
Just retire
Proud of you boys!
This defense under performed all season long! Todd Bowles deserves some blame now, healthy or not. upon
Hopefully we see Tom back. Watching him on this team has made me love football again.  As far as this team. I want to see 7 DBs drafted. This secondary is a joke. I don't care what Bowles called. To get burnt twice down field in less than 60 secs is pathetic
Class act
D was a let down all season.
I hope he has at least one or two more seasons in him!
Your still the goat in my eyes you will always be a winner! If you do retire god bless you and your family. You have been a great part of my childhood and adulthood. Hope to see you again if not have a career man!
Not the result I wanted, but we played well all season for all the injuries/drama.
Only 40 seconds to overtime!
Bucs got nothing to feel ashamed of, what an awesome year! Looking forward to DOMINATING next year!
Class Act.
Refs tried to lift him one more time but he didn't have enough. Sad!
Brady doesn't just come to play football and win, he comes to slay your team. He is a savage.
The team never up. Wat an amazing comeback. Brady can't retire. Needs 1 more superbowl. Or atleast 1 more season. Great season guys. Bucs fan for life!!
Great game no matter what!!
Anyone know why he's wearing a Jean jacket in the thumbnail but a white shirt in the video
They will be on a revenge tour next season Tom always remembers
Antoine Winfield 🚮
Thank You for being you. Great team, great leadership, great season… love & gratitude to ALL.
I absolutely guarantee that was his last game. He just launched a clothing brand 2 weeks ago called Brady Brand. The coaches and team players will be going elsewhere for more money. Tom Brady like Aaron Rodgers does not want to do a team rebuild. If he didn't win it this year which was just a continuence from last year,  he definitely wont win next year. He also used to respond to question of retirement saying "No Way". He's not saying it now.
NFL > WWE
“I was thinking about winning” Sums him up
I'm very disappointed that the Bucs defense is messed up. 😞
What a LEGEND! Love you TB12
Thank you.
Still great season Tom Next year we'll have Godwin back and we'll be in good shape again
i was thinking about winning~!     That's kind of my mentality !  ;-)-         Yes Sir!
I consider myself lucky to have seen that guy play.
As a MAJOR Bucs fan, I’m sad about the loss but very happy that the Bucs made a huge comeback last minute. We put up a good fight
Tom Brady is overrated
Tough loss aft a great comeback.  This was NOT just on you, so don't go there.  The TEAM & coaches all have to each own their failed contributions to this game. They know who they are. Be proud of the 13- 4 , 2nd seed winning season.   Next season, would love to have you back for 1 more, buuut I know you will make the right decision for you.   Stay healthy.  Enjoy the off season Tom.
If Tom does retire even with the loss this is a very Tom Brady way to go out with a amazing comeback to tie the game
Why does he have to leave.
Word on the street is that Tom Baby blew his brains out after the press conference.
Thank you Tom!! You are still the goat!
It's gonna be a sad day when this man hangs it up. Legend thank you Tom! Hope he comes back next year. Go Bucs!
Well done Bucs! No superbowl this year but you did dam good.
If you include the WRs that went down in this game, the Bucs lost 6 WRs since the Saints game. SIX. They had 3 WRs on the starting roster by 4th quarter, I have no clue how they even made this a game
one question What could prevent our guys from trying to stop at the say half yard line by running out of bounds and leaving just a few seconds left on the clock or something is there a rule that prevents clock manipulation like this?
Hey! We stole a super bowl last year. So I’m happy with the Brady signing.
Happy for Stafford!
Boles does a blitz  and leaves the safety alone with Rupp inexcusable imo. But the Rams made the plays in the end, dont know  how the roster will look next year l. But hopefully Tom comes back and then team makes one more run
not even my team but who doesn't wanna see greatness at it's finest
I hope I am wrong but feel Tom will retire. 22 years is a long time to play in NFL and getting burned out.
That blitz was a ridiculously bad call
*ANY GAME BUT ESPECIALLY A PLAYOFF GAME WHERE TOM BRADY CAN'T CHEAT HIS WAY TO A WIN IS A THING OF BEAUTY!!! TOM BRADY IS THE GOAT OF CHEATING LOL!!!*
Brady if you decide to keep playing football please stay with Bucs.
Did TB12 just put away the Gatorade? 😂
I’ve been a Patriots fan for 30 years and will always be a Tom Brady fan.  I can’t picture him deciding that this frustrating loss was the last game of his career.  If they won the Super Bowl I can see him saying “enough” and retiring
Hope he does not retire we need Tom Brady🏈
Im proud of the bucs for having a great season nonetheless
If they had Godwin it be different outcome
LEGEND OF THE GAME KING BRADY🙏🙏 GREAT HUMAN BEING.. win or loses stil grateful for everything and stil care for his teammates ✊👍
Moved that Gatorade immediately
Too much class to quit now, Brady will be back
Respect this man
Great season in total. Sucks to not move forward, definitely is a gut punch, but can’t complain looking back on the season
Too many key injuries.
Hey Tom and team, I still love you guys!!!!  Chit happens......
LOVE TOM, LOVE THE BUCS GREAT JOB ALL YEAR!!! WE'LL BE BACK
Bye bye Brady
Just hope he comes back, so strange if he leaves, it be like loosing a brother, the dude has been with us since 1999, when I used to watch Michigan, it be a real strange Sunday when the NFL games start without TB12, but I guess times change, and all in the end we are left with  Memories
Linesman Smith wasn't playing, he allowed three sacs, five hits. He signal handedly lose the game. Was he paid off by the Rams?
Still not winning the Superbowl Rams.
Love you bro ! You are the face of the NFL. Greatest of all time.  Whatever decision you make, love always and football would not be the same.  Respect TB12. What a human being . I know you will be back for one more season.
Well maybe next year
yeah i haven’t cried over a game in a LONG time
I say there were two plays that changed the game and refs had their hands in it one Brady gets hit in the jaw after completing the 20 yard pass bloody lip and he tells the ref they give him the penalty should have been ruffing the passer call  Also that hit on Evans late in the jaw again said play was dead ? Dead ? It was a split second if that somebody blew the whistle that quick ceez that should had a flag on the defender it was a rip $$$ maybe ..sort of strange though !!!
I’m happy its not a blowout what a game.
Thanks Tom
2 outta 3 next year sounds good to me!!
Lot of key guys missing but still keep it close game Hats off to you Mr. Brady
I love you Tom Brady!!! You have nothing to prove! Be with your family while you are still GQ and Athletic. Great comeback though!
It's okay Tom. Next season starts now. The Superbowl will be yours again soon, where it belongs. Keep grinding. At the end of the day everything will always be okay. 💗🧸🏆🤘🏼🤙🏽🎸
Bye bye
Please come back
It’s sad that a team can give the ball away 4 times and still win. The refs were in blue today…. I’ve always said that a good team can’t beat the other and the refs…
proud of you Tom.
No one knows the outcome had the game gone into O.T, but Tampa definitely had the momentum. The defense did incredible in the 2nd quarter, unfortunately the play calling was horrendous in that last drive.
Love you Tom hope you come back
Thank you for another great season Tom.
What a privilege to see this man play. Definition of a leader. Thank you, Tom.
I can hear  the  rest of the teams !!! Tom’s out we have a chance 😎
T.Brady's leadership and excellence has totally turned the Bucs from a low graded team to highly respected Superbowl champions. Tampa needs to send Brady a huge thank-you card. He's definitely the G.O.A.T. 🐐
Should had been more dumping the ball that got Brady all those yards in the past. Too many long dangerous passes.
From Patriots to Tampa Bay Buccaneers he gave his all to the game of football. if he's really done and retiring it will be hard to watch the NFL without Brady. it's like when MJ stepped away in 98 it was surreal. I couldn't watch the NBA the same way I used to.
Should have never gotten rid of AB I told everybody‼️ now this really proves my point‼️
Let’s run it back! Sign everyone back to 1 year contracts and let’s give Brady his “last dance” 🐐
This man is a LEGEND you will NEVER SEE anyone like him again. GOAT🙌
Love you tom
If bucs had Wirfs and CG. Would have been a different outcome. I mean Cameron Brate was a slot receiver LOL. Great effort by the Bucs
Proud of our TEAM!
Undisputed 🐐
Thank you Brady!!!
I think next season they'll be back and they'll be much healthier
TOM ROCKS IT...NEXT YEAR ..WOULD LOVE TO SEE BRADY & GRONK TOGETHER AGAIN 1 MORE TIME...SUPER BOWL NEXT YEAR !!🐐🏈🐐🏈STILL THE GOAT !!!
Amazing season. Many set backs and it came down to a first down.
The Buccs offensive line (even the starters) played absolutely terrible.  I understand the starting RT being out, but the starters were just atrocious.  Surprised that Tampa Bay was able to make it competitive in the end.
Gatorade is not happy with that
It was a great season Bucs. Let's get ready for next year.
Injuries got em in the end.
I just hope this isn’t the last time we see the goat. He has one more year on his contract I hope he comes back.
Greatest quarterback to have ever play the game of football and the greatest NFL player of all time. He'll be back.
Nothing to be ashamed about. Amazing season. Rams just played better today and the Bucs never gave up.
Team never gave up. Great season despite all the problems they had.
Very fortunate to be able to watch Tom Brady at his greatness in yr 22 and hopefully this isn't the last time we see Tom Brady in a Buc/NFL jersey
First comment   Buccaneers should have won
Tom Brady will win the Super Bowl next year mark my words
