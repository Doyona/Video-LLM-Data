# when Larry Elder said that he was the black piece a white supremacy the day that was his downfall and every other black grifters worst nightmare when you are friends with Benedict Donald
The Californians Voters have decided to keep Governor Newsom in office because they are Comfortable with him with High Taxes High Gasoline Prices over $6.00 Per gallon Homeless policy that has Failed Also Crimes with Crimmals ruining the Community with DA George Gascon letting them out into the Streets so if you enjoy this keep me for the Democraties and and Governor Newsom in Charge
Don’t run ever!
Even to this day...he still a 🤡
“After doing all that you can: STAND!”
God bless him
Let's go Brandon
I completely 👏🏾 this man, but his Opponent had help with celebrity’s and what’s worse is,that NO Celebrity not even #1 came to have Elder’s back,now that tells you a lot.
This man didn’t lose, the DemonRats want their people in control. Trump didn’t lose either... people received voting papers for people that were dead for over 14years.  Says enough doesn’t it?
While I agree with Mr Elders message, government will never have the answer no matter who's elected. It's a big club and you and me are not in it. We need separation from our abusive handlers. I'm not even sure they're human at this point.
WHY LARRY ELDER LOST >>>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiI09qkaWAo
Glad you lost Larry!
Sorry about Larry losing seem such a nice straight up guy. I think the same thing will happen next year in 2022 with the mid terms, remember the democrats still control the counting and who's doing the counting. With them moving covid positive and unvaccinated illegal migrants around America in an effort to keep the virus going. While also trying to force American citizen to get vaccinated or they will force harsh penalty on them by bring in vaccine passports which will effect their work and how they vote.   Wait and see mail-in voting will become the norm, making it easier for them to play round with the counting especially when there's no auditing(forensic). Mask mandates will continue for everyday citizen while the elite only wear their's in front of the cameras, just like they do with social distancing. Hollywood has been's, democrat politicians, famous people and the rich all get a free pass.   ANYONE WHO THINKS THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE UP CONTROL EASILY ARE FOOLING THEMSELVES.
Larry look me up!
Probably the biggest mistake California has ever made.
and the cheat still continues.   biden brought the diminion machines again.to california.
That’s too bad.
I'm glad this idiot lost.
Nice guy... but he listened to McCarthy and Nunes and other Trump lackeys!  We said, "Larry, don't listen to them... Trump is toxic, voters will crucify you if you support Trump!"   So, what does Larry do?  He supports Trump!  Some people will sadly never learn.  🙄
How  are you  going to win the war ? When the elections  are fixed ! Tired of hearing  the false hope, when you  know  darn well  that the corruption  will never be overcome  ! IT'S TO LATE !
2Tim. 3:12 “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.” I guess we can’t expect very many wins these days 🙁
Brace yourselves!
How could he lose  majority of cali people were behind larry unless dead people out voted them
What happened to 1.7 m ppl recalled.newsom
Why u didn't win!!! You are.true n honest as far.as I know. Run again
Ppl said they were told already voted but they didn't. Recal Newsom
His kuuning azz really thought the people in CA was gonna actually elect him as gov, SERIOUSLY?
Ca is lost for ever 😕😔
Its California's loss.....
Mexican Americans for Trump and LARY ELDER 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Larry L Nerd
The cheating is still going on  huh?
Maybe this uneducated crackpot can now go find a real job or something
Larry is a bit fake. He is on record describing how his father was a total shitbag that disowned him. So when he talks about being "inspired" by the advice his father gave him: that is fake shit. I am a nr1 fanboi of Larry, btw. But fake is fake
At least this guy isn't claiming the vote was rigged...he isn't creating a 'big lie"....
I hope this jerk goes away and never comes back.
Not convinced he actually lost
Republican, check Delusional, check Loser, check Nobody is being forced to do shit by your sorry ass.
My opinion is that they cheated … They had envelopes that you could view how people voted. Larry Elder is the adult in the room…
What a class act - CA lost out. We could use Mr Elder in Washington state.
a joke
True unity, we don't divide by race...? Look at all those Black folks in the crowd!
thats why you loss moron
NC needs a new Governor, Larry! I know you haven’t been a politician long, but you are exactly what our country needs in state leadership…common sense! Here we have our Governor choosing CRT and no voter ID because…you guessed it - racism! I love to hear you spew facts! California will suffer under the hands of the Democrats - they already have!
Oh please Republicans are nothing but garbage
Hahaha oh please devil
Aww poor baby do you need your diaper change
Democrats are praying that Larry Elder runs for gov again in 2022. 😂
Hey if ur poor how do u vote republican I'm just asking cus if ur voting for rich people shouldn't u share in that in some form or fashion 🤔
How do ya'll feel about atheists though? I was raised in a very bad cult and I don't believe that absolute freedom of religion is a good thing and I don't believe religions doctrines should affect laws what so ever. I imagine you're equally and love stops with me. Because I believe in human rights and love before God.
He didn’t have a chance.
You loose tho  That means your father taught you wrong. There's no way ANYONE. Listening to you at anytime clearly. Looserrrrrrr
Such a great an honorable man.
Larry, you gave this an honest and classy effort and that's all you can do.  California has  been too skewed to help for decades, yet you have made major inroads for us, at great personal risk, and we appreciate it.  Those of us who voted for you, believe in you and hope you will keep trying.  Keep watching the count numbers (and live map) until the end, because, although we certainly won't win this one, you will see definite progress.  For instance, it's predictably a landslide in the more populated areas (around 70/30% in LA and more like 85/15% in/around the Bay Area), but the whole rest of the state to the east (including Orange and San Diego counties) is either turning red, or very close to it.  I'm not sure we've seen this for a very long time, if ever.   Granted, the Bay Area is enough to offset the near defeat (or actual defeat) in other counties to the tune of 60/40% overall (where I believe it may land when 100% votes are counted).  60/40 in this backwards state is a monumental achievement if you ask me and the obvious polarization of the state seems an opportunity in the election next year.  Keep bringing the failings of the state and its leadership to light.  People can't ignore it forever.
SPRAY TAN LARRY LOST "beautifully" NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF RECALLS HAS SOMEONE LOST IN SUCH LARGE NUMBERS. TRUMP PITY PARTY TO FOLLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Since it's all rigged, Republican's need to make a stand and never vote again. It's the only way.
Question tho if u had the numbers to have recall election in first place how hell u lose?
California deserves whatever comes to them. All good Americans like Mr. Elder should just abandom the sinking ship.
I have some info you might find important , check who counted the votes in the recall “Tommy Gong” and how he resigned before the recall but they didn’t appoint a new clerk until he counted the ballots … The person who counted the recall resigned before the count but counted anyways, hmmmm …
Judge Robert Bork. .book " Sliding to Gomorrah..."  You are. There Mexifornia...
We all new that all elections would be rigged especially after the election was stolen and no one was held accountable or arrested.
Wow I can't believe  anybody thinks Gavin Newsom is doing a good job. Please wake up . Gavin Newsom is not keeping us safe.The non pandemic is a fear tactic. If it was a pandemic people would be dropping dead in the streets. Listen to all these front line doctors, not Faucci. God Shed his light on thee. Amen😇😇🇺🇸🇺🇸
Yes we all going to win the war
God bless elder
Larry elder only lost because this just like the presidential election was rigged. People showed up and told them that the votes had already been casted in what other elections had that been an issue besides this one in the presidential election it's a trick question there wasn't one
LARRY ELDER WON.
Hey Larry..I am with your Truth... Move to Portland or Seattle ..Too git the Vibe of Mexifornia...
There is NO elecrions these days, its all fraud😤
Nobody wants to Hear the Truth... Larry Love Shine 0n.. Happy Trillions America..

👏👏👏💪🙏🌎💯
They voted for Gavin Nuesancs over this man? Smh
Would have been a great governor and much better than newsom
Larry elder in his own element here funny noticing his supporters hes the one that sticks out the most if you catch my drift!!!! They must line his pockets real good!!!!!!!!
The Pimp Elder is now sweeping the forest floors for El Trumpo
Can't believe he lost its probably like Biden thay stolen votes
not all of them
the votes have not been counted yet
This dude delusional! What a template of a speech. https://youtu.be/vYhdiOy6ZgM
Larry got beat so bad it could be Elder Abuse
No state whose homeless population exceeds the overall dwellscore of other states combined is in a decent position to pat itself on the back.
Reading some of these comments makes me sick and it shows how ignorant some of you brain washed people are. Larry Elder is an awesome human being and y’all cant stop calling him names and bashing him for standing up for what’s right. Enjoy your communist utopia of corruption. Y’all deserve it.
Those darn masheens again!  Changing things after the tallly....
lol...lmao.
Elder learnt how to lose from one of the world's biggest losers, #TraitorTrump. The result speaks for itself, an absolutely humiliating drubbing, glorious
Larry Elder you are a class act  despite losing.  Voting does not  seem to count because somehow they are able to steal them.  Larry you are a good man hats off to your parents.
Did he lose or did the machine win???
Is there a filter on this video's comments to block certain types of posts? Nothing too bad but maybe certain keywords, etc.?
Larry's a real class act! Pls run for Michigan gov. Cali isn't worth your talents!
Elder's skin may be black but his soul is not. When it comes to who I (and I am white) vote for, it has more to do with his soul and his ideals than what color he is. History has taught us that evil can reside under any color and in this case his soul has been blackened and corrupted by Trump.
Where where all those liberals who liked to call anyone who opposed Obama a racist.  "you didn't vote for him because he's black"  Sound familiar?
A third rate entertainer that makes a living pandering to frightened trumpsters.
Ha ha!  Republicans haven't forced anything with this bogus recall effort other than them into a corner.  It not only failed, but strengthen the Democrats.
VOTE BLUE in 2022!!!
Great message from your dad.   Trump needs to hear that too.  He lost period!  We believe in democracy. We cannot allow anyone to divide us. We must stick to the truth and only the truth.  Ignore the lies!  We are United States of America.  Regardless who you voted for, we need to respect each other. God bless us all!!!
Republicans dont care about homelessness dont care about failing schools dont care about rising cost of living they so 2faced. Make me sick!!
Can't believed newscum won
Personal accountability: Larry has it. Gavin doesn't.
So all you Newsom fans?  Stay your asses in Cali; don't come to Texas anymore, because we now have CONSTITUTIONAL CARRY (Oh, NO!!  Scary guns!), the Heartbeat Bill (you can't use abortion as your main form of birth control anymore), and we're red as red can be.  You love Newsom for your own freaky reasons......you can keep him and - better yet, HE CAN KEEP YOU.
HELL of a maiden voyage, Larry!!  You really got AMERICA'S attention - not just California's.  So, this was NOT a defeat by any means.  Stay the course, but don't put yourself down by calling yourself a "politician": you are (thankfully) NOT a politician, but a AMERICAN with the knowledge that WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER!!!!  Love ya, buddy.  We know, in spite of what Ahhhhhnold says, that YOU'LL BE BACK!
No one is paying attention to you
Larry I'd a great man the democrats are literally modern day nazis
republicans waste 300 million on a recall then vote no on funds for homeless programs
This is what Republicans need. No more Trump stuff. Stick to the real issues.
I knew Elder was going to get trounced long ago.  How?  When he said he believed Biden won fair and square.  When he said he believed that Jan 6 was a riot.    And sure enough.  They ran the same fraud scheme they did on trump... and instead of making sure that there were people in poling centers ready to kick in doors and expose their fraud.  He let them walk away with his victory.  He just got bulled by beta boy newsome  Civility is whats getting you killed out there.
Walgreens Cooling Gel
Elder may complain about everything, BUT you have no solutions for anything whatsoever!
California is officially done for!
How can the average California resident actually vote for Newsom why ? The guy sucks and is a total fraud. So if you voted for Newsom please please tell me why you did and what has he done that's so great for California ? Please..i honestly want to understand. Thank you.
Larry won but got illegally cheated out because if career crooked politician Newsom got booted it would cause a gigantic dominion effect. Democrooks are scared to death they need California as a stronghold for their decades of failures no promises and massive debt. So if you actually voted Newsom than your a damn fool.
what a scam. ballots found on homeless people, but I'm sure it was fair
Elder the 2021 Governor of California LOSER🥚 🥚 🥚
Elder - a dangerous, vindictive, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and willfully ignorant narcissist.
Sir you lost. Nobody is listening to you.  YOU LOST!!!!  Head back to Candy Land
Is that Gwen Stefani on stage behind Larry?
Smartest man.i look up to you larry
Sorry to see this, all the best Larry, fight on my man.
California needs an Audit like the one in Arizona. If republicans knew the election was going to be rig why didn’t they stop it BEFORE the election?
Love you Larry!!!
No doubt in my mind  there was probably cheating
I've seen organized paid left democratic activist committing voting fraud.  They have an office next to mine.  Hate politics now. I don't believe in the current democratic system.
California wasn’t ready for  A Black Governor they Have a lot of Hidden  Racism 🙈 like Most ‘  States that are  Southwest hahahahaha 👈🏼👁
Will they do anything different now? I don't think so...
Be smart Larry and do it most others are doing and flee that manure pile of a state known as california. There is a reason it's losing population and companies.
Larry will win, the movement is growing. The fight is never over!!!!!!
No election happened. California decided not to have one.
I don’t know how you think an administration who frees repeat criminals will play fair on any election.
Goodbye. Goodbye goodbye. Now I’m happy
YOU LOSE. THANK GOD. NOW GO AWAY
Elder has no black supporters and he can't bond with them, he takes black votes for granted. Can't win doing that. Lmao 🤣
Shocker ballots lost from Red counties……my entire family’s ballots haven’t even been counted and it was called so early.  Everyone knew Pelosi wouldn’t allow her family to be recalled. There is a reason that people are leaving this state in droves and prices are going through the roof….starts with state leadership.  Tax the hell out of the workers and small business owners to hand it over to the ones who refuse to work or attempt to fend for themselves.  Sad and pathetic that this state is rated one of the lowest in the country in so many categories yet the highest in so many as well. None that we could be proud of. Crime, taxes, fuel, housing, foreclosures and bankruptcy. At one point California will have more takers than givers and that’s when keeping the lights on might be an issue.  Keeping voting Blue and let’s see where we are in 5-10 years.  Waste land
LIKE A BOSS...
Jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 losers Republicans
Anyone who claims fraud BEFORE an election "IS" the fraud
Glad to see Larry as a loser it fits him well.
You are forcing them to celebrate you lost!
Energy, homelessness, forest/climate change ? When Obama pushed these issues years ago nothing but disdain, and naysaying  from republicans
Mr Elder did excellent for just 2 months in the political game, look how established he has become! Mr Elder will be announcing again he will be running for political office. We are with you Mr Elder 100%.
He admitted that he lost . Surprised that he didnt claim it was rigged.
Kicked in his proverbial ass at the polls just like trump, got his ass kicked.  😂
Now this fool can go away. Hopefully for good.
Loser Larry
you should have to pay to sign a recall petition. that exercise in futility just cost the state 276 million dollars.
They arrested a guy with his car full of ballots everyone just watched them cheat so hard
Losers like these are killing the US was it stolen AGAIN.
If you voted Yes for recall, evacuate from this sunshine GULAG asap.
Another trumpster Bites the Dust don't worry you'll get to see him on Fox news he has probably already signed a contract with them.
If CA fails to audit like Arizona, this was ALL for nothing.
As an outsider, I hoped he was going to win
We didn't lose, it was stolen. Wake up!!
This is said news for California so keep a asshole that won't work for you state same as Oregon we tried to recall are governor 4 time I know how you feel corruption at its finest
born in the 3rd base?! Dems listen to poor better than any Reps
California Dominion , on such a sunny day ? I went to vote , and was turned away , turned away , they said that i already voted? no need to stay , no need to stay ,i got very angry and said there must be away , must be away ? they gave me a provisional ballot , that they just threw away ! they threw it away ! Dominion voting , blocking us all the way ! banana republic , They took the USA away !
Meet who I want to be Trump's vice president pick. All the way Larry
Thank goodness this man lost... he has absolutely no substance... just observe he constantly repeats things he has said at previous campaign stops... same old same old...
Why Demonrats and Californians made black racists and make California weak?
At least he has more Balls than Trump and conceides. If only he wasnt Trump sicko he would probably would have WON, some of the things he says in this video EVERYBODY can agree to
Larry L-der 😂😂😂😂😂 hold this L Larry😂😂😂😂
The Leftist Nazis must be so proud of their Media Networks -  I never thought Cali would be the Nazi base for America,  but damn it happened and they are proud of it.
what a loser... an idiot who does not know governance
Unfortunately California is like a prostitute who doesn’t know anything better but to run back to her pimp (Democrats) because he’s familiar and gives her just enough crumbs to keep her hanging around.  Larry Elder would have been a breath of fresh air to this State!
Loser like his idol
At least now everyone knows how corrupt Gavin Nuisance is. I Hope Larry will run again.
lmao are you kidding me?!...Larry Elder doesn't even care about homelessness. Larry Elder wanted Castro style communism, where everybody works for  ZERO minimum wage.  Thank god he lost... Larry is probably now going to go cry to papa Bannon after this, back on his radio show.
All you had to do is focus on the water crisis AND blame it ALL on Gavin Newsom. They don't like water storage, dams reservoirs because the water quality is lower and it's bad for the fish. We only have water for half the state in a WET year. That's why Newsom won't talk about it
We here in California can not have someone like Larry Elder come into power and threaten our greatest industry, homelessness!!
Thank you California for making the right decision! We will not be Texas or Kentucky.
That's sick 🖕SOB forgot🖕🏿one thing that he is black 👩🏿‍🦲👩🏿‍🦲👩🏿‍🦲.........FOOL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oU96x_QaoY
I would like to thank Candace Owens for helping Larry Elder lose the election by exposing his WS talking points against black African Americans, and how he believed racism/slavery against black African Americans was ok because they were property. 🤔 So thank you Candace Owens you did good this round. He is a danger to the black community period. I am not a fan of Gavin Newsom, but I'd take him over Larry Elder any day. Now, he wants to speak as if black African Americans are important to him because he loss. Yay!!!! Glad he was defeated!!!!
Mr Elder, support to you from Belgium 🇧🇪✊🇺🇸
Larry!  Sir!  We still have the future...  The IDES of 2022 and of 2024 are fast approaching...!
Oh, Lar! Nice try. “THE ELDERS” are probably proud of your effort……FAILED tho it was. 😊
HOUSES IN TEXAS (REPUBLICAN RUNED STATE) ARE ABOVE $400 THOUSAND TOO. UNLESS YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT WHERE TERE ARE NO JOBS THEN HOUSES ARE CHEAP. AND LETS TALK ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES AVERAGE IN TEXAS IS 1.8%  WHERE IN CALIFORNIA AVERAGE IS .73%
Did Larry Elder have any policies to push? Or was he one of Trumps *my favourite black* stooges to just spout platitudes
Cmon Cali y’all about them Black Lives Matter let him be a government
Ladies and Gentleman winner by majority decision and still Californians Champion Gavin Newsom.😎 big Loco East Los Angeles Califas 💯 🇲🇽 🇺🇸.
Newsom was saved by Elder ...
Voter ballot fraud!!!!! Newsom cheated! Man found d with thousands of ballots sleeping in his car!
North Korea or California take your pick both are pretty much the same.
The crowd didn't cheer when he mentioned homelessness.
Lol Larry is a joke. They forced nothing. Lost their fucking asses. It was a landslide… completely REJECTED. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Gavin Newsom signed over 100 fracking permits. Why is Elder lying?
The election went the same way as Biden and President Trump
Elder's "war" is a war on Democracy. Elder pushes Fascism. He's a fake American, as are most Republicans. Elder shows he doesn't care if people die, all he cares about is getting power. Don't listen to what Republicans say, watch what they do. They're taking away the right to vote, they don't want to end the pandemic or save lives, they don't want to improve the country's future. Only the stupid and narrow minded can't see that.
Vote for trump or any his dumb minions and you will lose
He didn't lose he was robbed just like Trump just like decades and decades of Democrats leadership they can't prove they won a single election not one They purposely hide burn dispose of all the evidence like they did in Georgia when they got that guy to blow up the f****** building where they kept all the ballots
I look at that crowd and I see mostly white people.  It baffles me why more black people and immigrants don’t jump on board with us. All the values that he is talking about, hard work, being responsible for your effort etc, are true American values that this country is built on.  And most black people and immigrants are hard working people.  Instead they cling to the same old Democratic philosophy that we need the government to take care of us and control our lives.
What a loser!
nothing will change larry. Newsom will make it worst and worst. that's what they do. most people don't even care what happens in their lives so they don't vote, they just complain. the people who voted for him are directly responsible but I have a feeling he probably cheated just like Biden did. thats what they do. trump is getting to the bottom of this. the swamp is vast.
He asked "How am I doing?" Answer:  Well you lost - loser!
Black lives matter racist leftist cheated larry elder. They are the true white supremacist
LOL
California, you may have blown your last chance to recover from a fast down hill slide t I the abyss.
An eloquent loser at the end of the day 💩 a typical american politician🐍
As long as there are "print your own mail in votes" republicans will never win another election for Governor in California ever again.
A majority of voters would have literally nobody before this smurf, lmao
Thank you Larry, for at least acknowledging the loss.  You shouldn't have started yelling "fraud" without proof or evidence.  Your idol Trump was also someone who started life on 3rd base and thought he hit a home run.  If you had decided to run in a real election instead of sliding into a spot with less than the popular vote, I might have considered you.  But following the Trump playbook and propagating the smaller lie isn't the way to go.  I'm not a Newsom supporter, and I would probably consider Faulconer as he may well be both a more rational Republican (in the mold of Baker or Hogan), although the last time CA elected a mayor of San Diego as governor, he fucked it up for all Republicans going forward (with the exception of Arnold).
Elder did good. Now Trump has all the info from this riged election again tied to  the Demonrats. 70% of the GOP could not vote in person at the polls cause they already voted for the Demoncrats ?
Nacys nephew.
The Newsoms, Pelosis, and Gettys have had CA under democrap control for decades. The Gettys are especially powerful with deep pockets. They're so wealthy they have two museums named after them. I'm pretty sure the Gettys took Newsom in and groomed him as a young man when he went to live with them. Now add to that the largest demographic and illegals. They're pretty much oblivious and subservient to big government and socialism. When the predominant religion of a country controls their slaves' minds, it's pretty easy to blindly accept a communist or socialist government. This is what was happening in Europe and other nations for centuries. Some religious people still have a subservient ,victim mindset. I want to be optimistic but it's very hard. I've been living in a leftists leaning SoCal my entire life. Grandpappy and poppa saw a very different CA from the 20s until the early 60s. They saw what was comin' and came it did!
Jack Pot!!! Larry lost!!!! Now we know that the elections are rigged in CA also!!! Because seriously no one in their right mind voted for Gabbin Nuisance!!! Larry Elder is man of the year in my books. Eventually the infectious spread of DEMOCRATIC FASCISM will be beaten and when it is Larry elder will be there!!!   : )
Larry got his ass kicked. He should just move from the state.  Democrats in Red States have done better. Then again they didn't proclaim that rapist, race breeders, and  murder s get reparations for property loss during slavery.
How are you doing as a politician? Well, can you say LOSER!
DONT FORGET CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES!!!  If its global warming, then all 50 states are going to have out of control worst wildfires.   but no, its just california
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I'd seriously love to see CA vote to @/calexit, so we can watch it become a north american version of Brazil: a middle/upper class of white and asian nerds creating all the wealth, a permanent black and brown underclass, some exotic people in the backcountry, and some flashy beautiful people in the largest city.  But it's all progressive 'nd diverse, ya know? At least Brazil has prettier, more feminine women.
TRUMP WILL ALWAYS BE A ONE TERM PRESIDENT
I'll let everyone in on a little secret, no politician is actually trying to help you. They're only in it for the corporate money and power. They could care less about you.  Most people can't even fathom that, but its true.   50 years ago, the differences between political parties were pretty minor. The government actually worked.  Now everyone is at each others throats because of what X politician says. All politicians are liars, thieves and cheats, they only do something when they can benefit from it.
They stole it SMDH
This guy was just controlled opposition.  The fact that he wouldnt touch the subject of election fraud, shows just how desperate people are to believe anything.  This was just a test, to see if you threw an R in front of someone's name that it would get them elected in Cali.  Newsom is only the 2nd recalled official to beat out thier recall.  Guess who was the first, lighting striking 2x for Dems with Cuomo.  How can they both have dodged the lightening strike?? Statistically, it's not in thier favor, but they pulled off the upset somehow
I Feel so sad he should've won , the Democrats are so EVIL , When will people wake up and embrace Capitalism again?
The people of CA don't know what they are missing out on.  They could have been a beacon of light for America to show the other states that there are people that will indeed step up and want our state to be great again.  I am praying we don't end up suffering more now that Newsom may end up feeling entitled.  I pray you will run for Governor in our next election.  You have my vote and my daughter's.  God has His reason/s for this outcome.  Be encouraged you did great for someone that was running for just 2 months.
Larry I live in WA. Would come here and reun against Insley? Love you!
California is DOWN T DRAIN. IM NOT SURPRISED.
Republicans lost Senate 2018. Lost Congress 2020. Lost Presidency 2020. Republicans lost both run off elections in Georgia. Now they also lost this election. LOOOOOOOOOSERS! I hope they keep going father and father right. It's really working out for them LOLZ
In a way, I'm glad Larry lost. California doesn't deserve anything good. Everyone living there is either rich enough to where they don't notice [or care] about the problems the state faces or grew up voting left, parents likely did and it's what they know. The best thing Cali could do for the US is to start on fire again and then sink into the ocean lmao.
God Bless Larry Elder for the MAN he is, for what he stands for, and what he's trying his hardest to accomplish. CA needs a man like him, someone who has a vision, and a plan to improve the problems in CA.  Larry Elder for President 2024 🇺🇸💥👍🏻
Loser
California is just hopeless, it’s a lost cause
This guy got absolutely hammered at the poles, and the lunatics still have the nerve to say the election was stolen! They've shown their true colors, expect this from now on every time.
Well we are going to miss you California...not!
This election result is the reason why California has net out-migration, despite being blessed with some of the best natural resources, climate, and geographic beauty in the USA. People keep voting for stupid, scaring away everyone who doesn't want to submit to left-wing authoritarianism and has other options.
Took at least 1 1/2 years as beginning of 2020 I remember them collecting signatures
Larry Elder says all the things about black people that white people love to hear.
you just can't win against a party that throws free money to incentivize people not to work in a place where the majority of voting population strongly back freeloading off goverment. people of cali don't think about what's good for the society but just care of what's personally beneficial. it's all about me me me here.
Democrats are strategizing to figure out a way to get this clown to run in other states.
even rep voted no on recall
Trying to put my finger on how Democrats benefit from Newsome being their leader.?? Who are these Democrats? What jobs do they have in California? ...well, I know most of who lives here in California are Central and South American immigrants. Then it turns out that for years the government has given them  payouts to start businesses. Then the banks will come in and give them loans to pay off for years. In the 1970's California banks turned their focus on Central America to build up their nations. Ronald Reagan and his administration also focused on Central America. Finally, after decades of nation-building, the ties between California Banks, the State government, the Cartel and nations of Central America were solidified without any hint of wearing down.
Imagine this goofball being the leader of California, an embarrassment 😳.
This is the result of getting endorsed by an Orange Buffoon.
you're not forcing them to do anything, they know they got it in the bag because they have jampacked their state with illegal so much there's no way in hell a democrat can lose in CA for the next 100 years Good bye, CA, you've been officially dubbed a sh1thole
What a class act….he is amazing 👍👍👏👏🥂
GREAT AMERICAN HERO
Overheard that Larry got beat so bad it was practically Elder abuse..🥴
This election was stolen. How can Californians vote for a tyrant yet again. I don’t believe it.
it amazes me to see all this idiot woke losers on twitter bashing larry elder on twitter about losing , but then what has gavin newsome done for the state of california , absolutely nothing. it sickens me that they cant see logic they want a corrupt state thats the bottom line here . its pretty sickening how hopeless the people of california have become to keep relecting a person who does nothing for the city.
Larry Elder is a joke. You lost to a Governor who is deeply disliked even by democrats. Being a complete nut job and a sleezy dishonest attorney is not a winning formula.
I respect and appreciate Larry for atleast admitting and accepting defeat and not pulling a "Tr%mp  big lie".  So happy that Mr Elder at least has respect for a working voting system. Good on you, Larry for NOT lying and attempting a "tr*mp Big Lie".  Surprisingly refreshing.
You didn't lose Larry, you lost big, you were never in the race. You've accomplished nothing but wasting taxpayers time and money.
Yep Larry that’s what I call a good ol fashion ass whoopin loser
aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhha lol ..now go a way
Positive attitude and bright side Gavin has a 90% chance of getting defeated in the next election.
NA NA NA NA HEY HEY HEY GOODBYE TRUMP BOOT LICKER....SELL OUT!!!
We avoided all the wackos!!!😓
*ready my name please*
😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you say so... LOL
Sooo much ignorance on this feed, it boggles my mind. People don't know about Elder because they don't do research. I could go on, but most would not grasp it. SMH
I’m glad he lost!
LE and the GOP got smoked by a landslide again. What a waste of millions, now the GOP has to spend more millions to find all the massive fraud that was happening just nobody wants to report it. Because there was none. LOL LOL
I voted for Larry but he’s not forcing the establishment to do anything. The man got 4.7% of vote. The idiots who engineered this recall ensured that Larry would lose and the incumbent would win. They basically triggered this recall so Newsom can enjoy the biggest landslide in CA history.
You made the wrong choice California!
How do you lose what you never had? Larry Elder can and will bring freedom back to the communist colony of China formally known as California
I think Republicans should get out of California not if but when it falls into the ocean we don’t want to lose no good people
How much things went wrong in this election I DONT TRUST IT
You got to be joking
This FN
Rock on Larry Elder!!!
And to the republic for which WE STAND! Stay United my people we got this!
California is a cancer
25 was born on third base but thinks he hit a triple.
As soon as a Republican loses, they start screaming "rigged" 🤣
Larry never conceded! He said, ‘stay tuned!’ There’s a part 2 since only 52% of the votes have been counted…’may take weeks to count the mail-in ballots’…
gee all the supporters are white...
Trump wins
So almost 2M people signed the petition and only 3.5M voted yes for a recall?  Something doesn’t smell right.
I came from almost nothing. I was a busboy in the summers in North Carolina when I was 13 on. I have worked just about every day since. I now own a beautiful home in Orange County, a wife and two beautiful children and I am proud of what I have achieved. I am proud of being a Californian and proud of Newson kicking everyone's ass. Oh, and guess what you are on youtube which is a California company ( have you heard of Google?) btw so thanks for supporting California.
I got the jab c19 GUESS WHAT!!!! I had a pain in my penis for 2 weeks 😪 than I realized my penis became thicker and got 2 inches extra length! GO GET THE VACCINE NOW AMAZING 👏🙌😉
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Banana Republic is a real thing.
Funny how mentions of the word war has the crowd breaking out in spontaneous orgasms. We've got nothing on Germany 1933 when it comes to fascist stupidity.
No one can pull us out of this.. no one is coming to save us.. we will have  to stand up to these tyrants who literally HATE US... however I feel for Larry , as they did in the past.. they cheated and pull their bs w/ this recall... but until we stand up they will continue to do this type of stuff  and it will get worse.
Not gonna happen bro.
Looks like the GOP has turned into a party of thieves , trying to steal elections by hook or Crook.
Could of given the homeless the millions wasted on this recall. A recall that was just the snow flake  Republicans having a temper tantrum. A very expensive temper tantrum.
62% combined tax for California here it comes for the life of me I have no idea why major corporation still do business in California.
Fake elections !  Larry Elder is the winner!!
hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahAAAAA HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAHAHHAHAHAHA then he said he wants to pay reparations to Slavers HAHAHA and he said that shit in California HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHH
You are awesome Larry. Thank you for trying. Love to you man.
A class act. We are with you. Thank you
Max respect Mr. Elder
Man I love this guy. Sad he lost, but life goes on.  It’s a long shot but hopefully he’ll win in 2022
Why do I feel like they cheated
You lost by a wide margin. You just confirmed that Newsom has a mandate from the voters of California. Oh, and if you could force Newsom or anyone else to do anything at all, you would have done it already. So, are we back to false and unpatriotic claims of a rigged election, Mr. Elder? Had your 15 minutes of fame. Probably get another 15 minutes in the next California election. Then be graceful and move on.
Perhaps do a forensic recount of a forensic recount of a forensic recount of the recall vote, and have Larry Elder pay for it all?
Even in defeat there is composure and genuineness , speaks a lot about Larry Elder . The red tide has begun 🇺🇸
#Blump
He would make a great president
Oh look the accusations of voter fraud with ZERO evidence!      I do have some evidence of election fraud  it's Trump asking the Georgia election staff to "find" votes.
California Republicans should get a clue.
😂 😂.. Republican'ts.. 😂
Another rigged election. CNN even showed the rig with about a million being there one second then moved the next
I don't feel sorry for people anymore. They keep voting in Democrats that screw everything and rob us and throw out republicans who support the people, jobs and are looking out for the American people like Trump did. Now, if you're screwed, good, it's most likely your own fault.
The poorest, least educated, most unhealthy (obese),  least opportunity for career growth, lowest paid workers, are all______(fill in the blank) states.
California has 40 million population, 22 million registered voters were sent recall ballots, about 9 million cast votes. Apathy has taken hold when only 22% of the population even bothers to vote. Shocking....Is it Why bother when the Sacramento politicians end up doing whatever they want anyway?
I love you Larry Elder my hero
Hahaha!
Raise a man? Do you have any issue with your masculinity? What about hard working women? And the Martin Luther King reference? This guy is so confused. No surprise he got destroyed.
Another stolen election. As soon as Americans GET IT that the Wuhan Flu is the golden ticket to stolen elections, there will blood in the cities & state capitals first....
“He lost and let us down… I don’t like losers,” - Donald Trump
Help the homeless. Help black students. But not by increasing ttaxes/spending.  Hold the homeless accountable for drug addiction. Realize that there are differences in intelligence. Those that struggle in school need to study harder. Buying housing for the homeless and spending more on education has proven NOT to solve anything Larry.
I love the dem 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑 in California  Poverty pimps
If he's a man, why would he post that crap about election fraud on his website.
Was the election fair? Did Elder have an observers watch the counting?
California and ALL democRATs are racist and will not elect blacks to office. Joe girl sniffing Biden an old WHITE man. And before you answer , obammy was not black.
What a shithole
United States of California...Hope they get everything they deserve.
MLK, you are damn right Larry.
You can’t be a supporter of Dr King, and Trumplican at the same time. All Trump does is spread division and hate. At the end of this speech, you sounded exactly like Trump. But at least you can admit that you lost, and you lost bigly
The poorest, least educated, most unhealthy (obese),  least opportunity for career growth, lowest paid workers, are all______(fill in the blank) states.
🤡 Thanks for the laughs son of tRump Larry
Shout it out
Liberal Californians don’t come to Texas. You’re not welcome. Stay where you voted to be at. 🤠✌🏽
What's wrong with the VOTE
I voted for you Larry!  This May have not turned out the way many of us wanted but we’re not given up either! There is still hope.
🤣😂🤣😂
Woke
You wanna hear something funny ? Trump / Elder 2024, Hahaha !!!!!!!
There is always next election to get gruesome Newsom!
Well. Calis f cked
I voted to recall that pig. I knew it probably wouldn't have succeeded but at least I tried. California is lost.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOSER!!!!!! 🤣🤣
what a loser
Larry Elder! Come run for Governor of Illinois!! Please?! We need you!
Voters were able to download ballots at home for recall election, sparking security concerns.   Also, the Dem state legislature passed a measure to send out mail ballots to every registered voter, regardless if they asked for one or not.   All factual info. You now make the judgement, about the likelihood, of cheating to occur.
Yes Republicans, please leave California. Dems and Conservatives are happier without each other. Hate us all you want, just don't live with us.
It's a shame Elder doesn't realize that Republican denial, mischief, and greed have led to the problems he cites in his odious speech. The only thing Elder is forcing the Governor to pay attention to is the far-right's "every man for himself" approach to America's challenges. I am pleased Californians turned away Republican efforts to recall Governor Newsom..
Looks like Larry "the Democrats are cheating with their votes again even though the election isn't even over!" Elder wasn't so lucky in the end. Oh well. It's a shame CA had to spend all that money on an election that had an inevitable result.
Larry here's what you could have done... You could have gotten with your Republican congressman to make sure you have election integrity for California. I believe you got the election stolen from you only because you didn't plan ahead and try to secure election integrity..
I bet those GOP lemmings down in Huntington Beach must have collapsed in shock.
Here's the truth about the California recall! Gruesome Newsom pissed off everybody in Cali, so much so that even the dumbOcrats welcomed the chance to recall this clown... Alas once the less than savy Cali voters got a look at the republiScum slate of candidates EVERYBODY decided Gruesome was the lesser of two evils. Guess we'll have to live with foolish tax & spend politics for a few more years.
This truly shows, votes don’t matter!!!
Republican concerns about "Homelessness?" Oh really? What is the republican plan for homelessness? More shelters?
No one is gonna pay attention to you or your demands. You’re not that important sir… I’m sorry but you don’t have what it takes for the Conservative party
All this talk, why don't they just do something? It's annoying yr after yrs. Nothing done are accomplished.
Massive loser.
Your parents raised not only a man, but a man of the people.  Others have only raised scum to the surface.  MLK is applauding loudly FOR YOU.
Newsom Orders New Lockdown So French Laundry Will Be Available For Victory Dinner
Elder if elected would have taken away all gay rights he can't even keep a women in his life what does this say
A politician with  seven to eight weeks of  experience and wants to run California
Larry elder will run again in 1 year unless marxist Newsome has completely destroyed the state and started a civil war, which Patriots would win cause the leftist useful idiots are all anti gun. Stay tuned. This aint over. We got cheated and lost the battle, but we will win the war next governor election. Larry will be back and will win.
Just like the Orange nightmare another loser
"I have been a politician for seven or eight weeks - how am I doing?"  You're a loser, that's how you're doing.
I don’t get it, conservative county’s like Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino all voted NO on the recall?
270 million dollars spended  by Republicans on this election for what?
i mean they stole the presidential election no one shouldnt actually thought this be any different
That dude should have won... California will continue in chaos
Why would California choose tok elssct a cis white male over this man?
There was no chance California would’ve gone to the GOP. The only option is to escape the once great state.
Racism!
Good he lost this man is not stable
Did Mr. Elder lose...or was it stolen?
How were absentee ballots already counted? Why were we showing already voted. We drank your lying cool aid.
Larry will be back, and win next time.
Where are the lawyers you said you would have ready for fraud?   The info ain't adding up. I just seen you on video saying you think Biden won fairly!!!!  That's  a problem. You dang sure aren't a republican.    Just unsubscribed to your lying a$$.
"Losing is like a disease, as contagious as syphilis"
Larry Elder is part of the swamp. No man gives up this easily. Newmsom and Elder are on the same team.
Clear the forests?  They are almost all federal land?
Look Larry ran to raise his profile and get money out of the crazy base.
shame wannabee trump,. BYE FELICIA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a sociopath…
It’s funny, so-called progressives couldn’t stand the thought of a black man as governor. A black man that never used his race as a qualification or taken a drink of the victimhood kool-Aid. I guess if you claim victimhood status and you run for office progressives will vote for you. I suspect because they are already being controlled and still part of the democrat plantation. Well done Californians showing the union out of control taxes, no affordable homes, dictatorship, homelessness, China dependent lithium batteries, unreliable power grid, dwindling job market, free money healthcare housing food for refugees and illegal aliens. Have you ever asked yourself why the politicians are becoming richer and richer buying multi million dollar homes? Is that progressiveness?
Wow... A GOP candidate lost and no conspiracy theory? No rigged election?
I mean did you honestly expect California to get rid of a Dem that easily
351k recall yes votes disappear in real time via CNN.  Give me a break, wake the hell up.
Your parents raised a liar, a hater of science, and a tRump tool.  You were crushed.  Take your divisive words back to the dying medium of AM radio, where you can preach your vitriol to the old, scared, and uneducated.
Elder isn't forcing anyone to do ANYTHING except vote blue. Clown.
Aside from the CA recall being a foregone conclusion, I like how a lot of dems are acting like cocky assholes for keeping Newsom when he's going to keep governing like a tyrant and not help California. I mean for fucks sake, you guys could've at least voted for another slightly better Democrat lmfao.
There is No way Newsom  legally won.  BS.
Larry did you concede to this? You won by a long shot!
Mr. Elder is Amazing!
Captain Hairgel has connections Joe Bernie Kamala Elizabeth Barack The Times was even compelled to call  Larry Elder a 'White Supremacist' and downplayed an actual hate crime committed against him.
I have a difficult time understanding why Californians continue to vote for officials that don't make notable improvements  in one of the richest states in America. Someone please name Gavin's achievements to date. Costs of Living is prohibitive. Homelessness has never been worse. No way are we going to build ourselves out of this within a term or two. Initiatives to solve this issue are literally Trash. There is no control or solution over Immigration. Just look at how Harris went abroad recently as our VP resulting in nothing. Where again did she come from? Benefits (Ex. Welfare and all the handouts that have become the norm) reward those who do the least (not including our senior and disabled population that the system should support). Climate Change is taking over regardless of the decades of reduction laws and crazy taxes to boot that Californians keep implementing on themselves like a dog chasing it's tail. Jobs? Our Government ran the last Car manufacturer out to Nevada and Texas for one example. Otherwise costs of doing business and taxes will take care of the rest. They killed tons of small business during the pandemic even though it did no good. People were getting infected at the big name retailers no different than they would have at a smaller business. When do we stand up and say enough? When do we really hold people accountable for their positions and results? Why can't we fire our Government officials when they don't do their jobs?
Sure religion helps him, but now I won't go church until new priest  arrives
LOL thought you got the message we don't want you or your ideas
🤣🤣🤣
He was happy at the back of the bus !!!!
So great that the Covid ignorant, recipient of domestic abuse charges, no minimum wage advocate Trump ass kissing toadie was denied a chance to promote his poison.  Still a black man dancing for his white overlord. You must be so proud that even this low bar was beyond your reach.
Elder lost election, worst alternative than current one
We ,the wonderful decent , level headed , progressively minded Californian people told him and his irk to kcuf off permanently.  Goodness will always prevail over evil.
Commiefornia proves to the world yet again how stupid it's voters are.  **IDIOT JOE NEEDS TO GO**
Another stolen election, I believe.  I don’t believe the people of California would vote against their life’s, their children’s life’s and their own livelihoods in such huge numbers.
Elder is a wanna be politician with Trump's talent for getting it wrong, wrong, wrong.... go back to your radio show Larry.
The dirty puppet lost
The suit speaks volumes who in the world wears a suit like that Oreos people who think slave owners deserve reparations after the 13th amendment
California is a progressive state and leads the nation in tax revenue. Quality of life couldn't be better. Ask anyone trying to afford a home in San Jose or just about anywhere else in the state.
This quirky comment section is better experienced with popcorn and a reclining seat.
So happy he kost
Considering all the business owners who wanted Newsom out, it’s obvious that this election was 100% rigged! Don’t worry! They will have their day. The wrath of God is coming! All those who are corrupt on both sides will face the judgment of the Lord God Most High. He is the King of Kings and, Lord of Lord, Nothing done in secret will remain secret, Newsom, Cuomo, Biden, Harris, Pelosi, Milley, zuckerberg, Dorsey, all world leaders and, all those corrupt judges, lawyers, doctors, police officers and, businessmen. You all know who YOU are and, God does too, Everything is being recorded in Heaven. It will ALL be brought to light. The only reprieve you have is repentance and calling upon the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy!
he need to get off the stage and go back to fox news
I have no idea what "conservative" means.
he a dirt bag, ask his ex wife!
Lived in CA all my life.  Next time Republicans complain about Democrats I will tell them that it is their fault because they didn't go out and vote that's why you have some homeless guy living on your porch .
Yahoo! Tell em! They haven’t heard the last of you!
They stole another election? Not surprised. Democrats couldn’t win otherwise.
Like GOP has ever given a crap about homelessness.
So proud of you, Larry!!! You are a good man! You are a winner no matter what.
Nope, you lost. Move on.
Keep spreading the "American Lie"  that "hard work wins".  Sad coming from a black man who knows better, but panders to the base controlled by racists and white supremacists.
Elder is mini Trump.  He's always been a loser.  He believes the minimum wage should be "zero".  He justified the MURDER of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman and would welcome Zimmerman to live in his (Elder's) neighborhood.  Elder said that white slave owners should receive reparations.  Before the election results were announced, Elder's camp setup a website to attempt to claim that the recall election was "rigged" and fraught with fraud.  Did elder even realize that the recall effort could easily end up costing California taxpayers over $280 Million.  Well, it has and what a freakin' waste of CA taxpayer money.  I am NOT a Democrat and I am NOT a Newsom fan, but I'm a truth, justice and equality-loving Californian and I will never imagine having a Trump surrogate as our governor.  Add Larry Elder to the list of black pundits and propagandists that have forgotten they're black.  Several others who belong on that list are Candace Owens, Terrence K. Williams, Kim Klacik, Herschel Walker, Tim Scott, Daniel Cameron.  I don't disparage the above  because they're black, but because they idolize racist Trump, who truly is and has always been a fraud.
Newsom's campaign just got woke.  But history always repeats itself, it's only a matter of time.  Stay tuned.
California also needs to correct the election law right away! And get away from fear of virus !  God bless California 🙏
What? No claims of election fraud? How else could he lose?
Larry Elder lost to a rigged election system, shocking.
Voter fraud is real amazing how everyone is okay with letting our country being stolen
Newsom is a coward who caved to big business and opened the state far too early during the pandemic, but this guy is somehow even worse!
Thank God!  he lost.   Another POS  want to be personality candidate for Fuhrer.
This guy had no chance in california , your gonna say yeah I don't believe in a minimum wage,  yeah i dont believe in vaccines and covid protections , which are actually popular there,  yeah I'm not gonna home the homeless , I'm not for healthcare for all , he had no chance in hell.
Motherhood and apple pie, wow controversial stuff there. He's a risk taker, yep. Did you ask the orange boy what to say? If he was standing there at least he could have insulted people better.
Yeah since when has a Republican ever cared about anything but their rich Rep donors and corporate donors. Reps always vote down every measure that would help lift people out of poverty or prevent them from slipping into poverty in the first place .
NOBODY CLAPED WHEN HE SAID HE WAS A MAN. Hahahahaha
Thank god this black white supremacist trumptard lost.
Wow he couldn't be any more full of sh*t. This republican scam wasted MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS
The U.S. is way too far gone. The corruption is unbelievable....
Shut up, Larry.  You do not care about anything except for yourself as a token African-American Repubican/QAnonist!
Larry Elder is another black hooded Klan member lacky of Trump & his minions.  He will betray the Black & minority communities in a heartbeat if he got into office.
This is so sad for california. I knew in my life time I would not see the good if Larry would win,but I was hoping for my grandchildren would have a good life.
They don’t listen and don’t care they have their voters programmed
If Elder thinks he would do a better job he needs to look at the states that have right wingnut republican Governors like him.  Thank God he lost and gave so many California residents the reason to keep a Democrat as Governor.
Donald J. Trump committed Quid Pro Quo with a foreign country. He was not impeached in the U.S. Senate NOT because he wasn't guilty. It was because if they had impeached him, Pence would have resigned making Nancy Pelosi President of the United States. No way would the GOP go for that. The reason they gave us was the Quid Pro Quo didn't rise to the level of impeachment hahaha. That said, how can Newsome be recalled for covid decisions and hypocrisy?
LOSER
I only hope this serves as a wake up call to Newsome over three million voters wanted him recalled , that's plenty of people wanting a change now the question is will he decide on improving what's wrong.
THANK YOU LARRY ELDER
Not a Californian so I have no dog in the fight, but first time I've heard this guy speak and can't argue with what he is saying.  But when I read about him on Wikipedia it sounded like his policy positions are from the 1950s. So who really is Larry Elder?
All this funding could have went towards the homeless people of California
Larry Elder come pilas
Being a sellout wins, that is what you mean! Punk brochista!
The Democrats aren't going to learn anything from this. They are going to keep doing the same things they have been, because enough people apparently like what a garbage job they're doing that they don't have to change.
Larry ... how do you be up 32.9% in votes on CNN , them right before my eyes it went down to 29.3 ... wait . what?  How does that happen. You should never go backwards. At least if anything if you never get another vote from that point on. It should stay the 32.9%  It shouldn’t go backwards.  This is the Kind of BS that people don’t Trust anymore!!
he is a trumper. period. end
What a COMPLETE WASTE of time and money from the Trump cult club. They spent millions only to LOSE AGAIN. Not sure Trump or his followers could feel any worse right now.
What a joke these people are.
Dignity ??? Larry Elder, Maga you can have your Cockroach
Fck  California
Elder is another Republican passing disinformation
Thats CRAP republicans suck!
I called it. Elder would lose. California is a hybrid of socialism and fascism
AUDIT TIME
🙏🙏🙏Please Larry run for government. California needs
STAYING TUNED, LARRY. STAYING TUNED...
Larry Elder is a total joke. republicans spent 250 million dollars of the states money to be completely humiliated. How anyone could vote for him, if only for dog catcher, is a mystery to anyone with an IQ of 80 or more.
I was just telling my son this morning before watching this "I THINK LARRY ELDER IS GOING TO BE MORE DETERMINED TO KEEP GOING." And I am glad for that.
The BIGGEST LOSER!!!!!!!! Now put Trump in front of a military firing squad for TREASON.
Don't worry Larry being a token, and grifter pays good money, this is the "black friend" conservatives is talking about when they say they have a black friend, this guy and Candace Owens👍
What a clown. How can you combine "War" and "Unity" speaking in regards to All Americans... (California's) for this instance. I have no party affiliation to be precise, not even to any party. Do we really think someone like this Man can change Millions within 2 months of promoting himself? Political preference at its best. It's like serving you a bone with no meat.   And 1more thing to the rest of the 49 states.. mainly the ones that talk trash on Californians... Who gets to funnel money to the rest of the states in an emergency? The "Federal Government "..??! Really..?!  We CALIFORNIANS pay income taxes like crazy  so the rest can get back on their feet.
300 million dollars of tax payers money for this recall. Then conservatives complain about Dems being expensive🤡🤡
I see where Elder messed up at however I'm not going to say, let people figure it out with theories.
He lost by several million votes to 'nobody'. He speaks of unity while belonging to the party of disunity.
You are tooo good for us. Thank you💕
Hahahahahahahhaahhaahah Watching republicans fail is just the funniest
If they can Rob President Trump, what chance does anyone else have.
How to concede with dignity.
Blue waves everywhere!
Larry Elder stupidity was what helped the governor stay. Larry sounded like the governors of Texas or Florida, what a disaster for RepubliKKKans.
Larry Elder had something to say?    My, my, isn't that a surprise!
That may need to shut up he’s a racist he loves white people he doesn’t even like he’s on black skin
It's a loss for everybody, sadly democrats just don't realize that
The definition of crazy is repeating the same thing over and over.. reelecting Gavin Newsom is that craziness!  I mean it would not have mattered if they put in another democrat or a republican as long as they got Gavin Newsom out of office he is terrible. Again he will be sitting back laughing at all these dumb ass people that support him.
You are not winning anything as a trumpf chronnie.
No Human can win this War  -  Only Jesus at this point
Clean the Forest ? Is this the rake the Forest to prevent forest fires thing again ?
Glad to see that he lost.
He lost because he’s the black face of white supremacy!
Well said Mr. Elder I wish you all the best keep fighting for our country and for the state of California which is in total disarray
Californians love high taxes, crime with no punishment, homelessness, terrible roads, failed high speed rail debacle, lockdowns, and overbearing regulations.
I knew this senseless and useless recall election would bring out all the Trumpster conspiracy theories. It's the Republican thing to do if they lose a fair election. Let the endless recounts begin.
Newsome Was about to get recalled till this loser showed up along with Orange man. Now Trump is calling election rigged.  Nothing new here.
He should be trumps vp pick if he runs in 2024 elder is a good man
Over 5000 comments for Elder speech versus over 500 comments on Newsom’s speech. Both comment section overwhelmingly for change in California, Where is the praise for keeping Newsom? Just Black Mirror stuff.
Damn…this guy lost to that plastic shill. This is not over. Far from it!
California Republican'ts are powerless because they refuse to adapt to contemporary realities. Evolution is real. Adapt or die. Oh, that's right, their leaders are already killing them off by lying about healthcare.
so educated, yet so ignorant.
Surprised that he didn’t just go with the new republican strategy and deny that he lost!
This fucking clown pretends he would do anything about homelessness. This piece of shit would send the cops in, destroy their tents and belongings, and ship them off to another town.
All the money raised by Newsome and the three hundred others who participated in this could have been used for something useful...like the homeless issue.
A fucking grifter, poor guy.
Elder's speech: one of hope Newsom's spech: one of fear and division
The reason Nuisance wasn’t removed is the same reason he’s in the governors mansion. Guess why??? Because some people don’t care enough about their fellow man, BY NOT GOING TO VOTE!!! I’m disgusted.
So glad Elder didn't win. Thank goodness
The election was rigged they did not count my vote or my wife's vote they never even scaned it into the system so how was every vote counted, if they can rig the presidential election that involves the whole united states they can rig California election
I will bet like Virginia's governor race that most of his adds did not get out and their was plenty of slander calling him a Trump supporter. The cities will always remain brainwashed. The 2022 elections will be a joke.
This guy is what an American is!
After they stole the presidency do you really believe that the Democrats would do anything fairly after that? Ever at any time?
Do he said thanks to El Chapo 🤭🤭🤭🤭
Ef him. Just a shock jock. I vote for Howard Stern before him. 🤣
Mail in ballot = fraud. Millions of out of state $s= fraud. There are no free elections in America, there is no equal justice. There will be a war.
hahahahahahahahahaha (pee break) hahahahahahahahahahaha
You lost because you were a charlatan and an opportunist that’s why you lost!! You had ZERO chance to win.
If they can rig the general election why not California
What a dolt.
Right go man
It’s rigged. So obvious!
Oops 😂🤣😅
This man defended a grown man shooting a unarmed teen pretty sure the minority community didn't vote for him 🤣
California does not deserve Larry Elder, Gavin Newsom is much for fitting for them. An elitist Bay Area politician that was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, masquerading as a champion of working class people, I hope you are happy with your state continuing to go down the sewer.
The reps been losing the war 😂
As soon as mail in ballots were being shipped out, the fix was in.  So sorry California.  Good luck with Newscum.
Who is the lady behind him?
Oh, that’s right you lost so that people care about the environment.
Not always true: work hard and hardy all your life and you get what you want not necessarily true! 🏳️‍🌈
The democrat socialists cheated again .
Everybody saw through Larry Elder as a big fake just like every single Republiconartist
Larry get a life,my brother
Blah blah blah!!!!
Now he knows exactly how President Trump feels. Get rid of the machines, and the fraud. This is supposed to be the land of law and order. TAKE IT BACK!
“California is a cesspit” --YouTube commenters from Arkansas  Hopefully we can aspire to one day achieve the same quality of life as your famously successful red states
I would never, in a million years, vote for that *TRAITOR who supported the failed coup of January 6th*
Ayo make this man president!!
Sacramento bee should be rename to "Sacramento BIAS"
If u spoke this way the last 7 weeks maybe u woulda had a chance but u tought that trump playbook was gonna work
I'm not so sure that we are winning this war. It seems to me that we no longer live in a republic. This means that everything we're doing is meaningless no matter do we vote for the same people stay in charge.
Gruesome Newscum won’t let us force him into doing better… instead he will be punishing us californians for the recall election. The next year will be even more hellish here as we must endure the wrath of that rich, spoiled, entitled, privileged, tyrannical devil clown who stole this election too.
well, lots of stupid sheep in Cal. Elder don't give up run next  year for gov.
Cannot believe how dumb California voters have gotten. How the hell do people think the established DNC robots care about Californians???
Commicrats have it set up to NEVER LOSE!!!
This is reason I dumped CA a long time ago.....you either go along with the heard mentality or get lectured on from the high horse loser politicans like NEwsom. Great speech Larry the 3rd base comment was classic and true!  Yes you will never see these a** clown liberals like Biden or Newsom ever get into an actually debate with the opposition.  They would be hung out to dry, so they get elected by the morons of society and carry handlers all around them that shield them from answering questions on the real issues. Weak beyond weak just as the people who prop them up and elect them.
Props for losing with DIgnity!  Something Trump and his like should learn to do.
To the 1000+ morons who thumbs-down'ed this video... You deserve Newsom and his abject incompetency, your high taxes and gas prices and the homeless situation that all of you continue to ignore. BTW, stay there, don't move to Texas, Florida or anywhere else that you haven't managed to fck up yet. Fckng idiots.
It's time to split California into North and South
Im a democrat and I voted for elder we seriously need a change there's no need for the same sh! under newsom he has destroyed our state and Larry is here to save it 🔴🔴
Well thats what you get when you  offend and ostracize the blk vote. Larry said he would love  for George Zimmerman to be his neighbor. Larry needs to know when to watch his stupid mouth. Education doesnt cancel out willful ignorance. It was no reason to bring Trayvone into this. His case is over.RIP. Only reason was to dog whistle the good ole boys  Confederate boys ASSEMBLE come give your boy a pat on his stupid nappy head. Its the only pat he will ever get. Ask Ben Carson. Micheal Steel.  Herman Cain. Slaves without shackles are Volunteers. .  There is no reason ppl CAN NOT oppose eachother respectfully. Only indignant uncivilived  heathens behave in such away. Without opposition we fall into barbaric dictatorship we dont grow or become better. DEMOCRACY never needed racism. The greedy does. .
Thank you Larry (TRUMP) Elder............you waste of skin!!!!!!!
You couldn't win a lucky bag as long as you depend the Great Dictator Trump
What an amazing man! Class act
Elder….such a good candidate….Larry go for it again!
Larry, you didn't lose, the election was rigged just like it was against our real President Trump. Mail in ballots, no voter ID, millions of illegals voting. Love you Larry!
the only men that came to him were crying for him to "GET OUT OF VENICE BEACH" when he went for a publicity shoot.  trying hard to fit in with the homeless.  mini orange
Californian's must like living in a sinking, burning, highest taxed state in the union...I hope they enjoy Newsom for a while longer....even when the whole state turns to absolute shit and all freedoms are stripped, they will still vote democrat.
California should be sad, they didn't get the intelligent human being to be their voice. They stuck up with this garbage Newsom. Sad days... Anyone would be better than him. Democrat or Republican. Doesn't matter.
*#1 Religion has no business in Politics....*
The loser from South Central
How about a “good man” or “bad man”, of course your a freaking man you dolt. Let’s also not forget Trump HATES losers.
Keep goin, Mr. Elder.  Got plenty of folks all over the country rooting for you - even here in Chicago.
Black Trump
Stop Yapping Loser
Rigged machines or just more straight up cheating 4 No 1 wants this idiot in office any Longer.
I'm glad you lost
It's so funny, did you just gain concern when seats were lost or do you really care about the issues of California? Define Retirement?
America is going towards an economic crash anyway. California being the biggest state will have the worst of it unfortunately. Newsom won't do any good.
Ha,ha,ha...." We united"...your dad Trump  ( racist)...divided all country ;  you will do same thing in California, I want you to go East LA...ha, ha ha...why you didn't came to E,LA ?  Montebello, Pico Rivera,  El Monte , Bell, ,Bell Gardens.... because you wanted the racist vote..... where you found it ?....Orange county.... with the Rich people $$$ ... that makes you a racist same as you looser former president "Dump"..." We the people"  dumped your clown....and you...
*Larry Elder was the butt of the joke at Fox News' The Five, now he's the butt of the joke of the Republican Party!*
Great speech
Why not force an actual count of all ballots? So many were not counted. How many people were told, "You already voted!"? Is a forensic audit out of the question? Some have captured the switching of votes midstream. How much other manipulation of votes has occurred?
A moderate Republican that appealed to both parties and ditched Trumpism probably could have won. Trumpism is a cancer. I'm very proud of my state today for rejecting all the hate and lies and killing this nonsensical recall effort.
Heard a story of people going to vote and were informed they had already voted.
There are times when a loss can then be used as a gain.  Calif. should  use this election so-called "loss" (which would have never occurred had it not been for more Dem massive cheating) use that 'loss' as the opportunity to FORCE an audit.  It'll be far easier to Prove massive cheating by using this Calif. Recall election than it was/is to try to prove that Trump's so-called 2020 'loss" was only caused by Dem massive cheating. ….If Dem cheating  during the CA Newscom Recall election can be proven, then  most people who still doubt that Biden won ONLY by massive Dem cheating - those people will Then see that Trump probably lost the same way as Larry Elder. ….WHY hadn't the Recall election have been to decide ONLY IF Gruesome Newsom should have been recalled or not, and with No mention during that election as to who should replace him if he were recalled?  I'd like to know how many people in total actually voted FOR recalling Newscom. . …..Do it, Calif.  Spend the money and time for an audit -- Because if Dem cheating can be "proven" to have taken place  in Calif.,  then "doubters" should also  realize at least the probability that Biden also "won" by Dem cheating.  ...Dems think Nothing about forcing U.S. taxpayers to waste billions of $$ on their Dem  "demands" - So we must force them to agree that our taxpayers should spend a fraction of that amount on automatic Audits after every federal government election.  The justification  is this:  Any stockholder of a company on any of the world's several "Exchanges" is a stockholder Only with the understanding that that corporation's financial records be "AUDITED" to prove the numbers and claims  are accurate  - The question of 'Why audit?" is immaterial to such stockholders because most of them already have some business sense.   Corporation Audits are Mandatory by LAW as part of the corporation's privilege to claim to be a corporation -- and for good reason:  to protect their stockholders.  There should always be checks and balances to keep a corporation - or any form of business - viable.   It's part of Common Business Sense - which there is very little of nowadays - with the present group of mostly dim-witted female Dem politicians.
This dude is not very smart.
Love this man. Gracious in defeat. Genuine. Something most californians have forgotten what it is to be!
I did my part! Rounding up hundreds of illegals at Home Depot. Vote harvesting rest homes in conservative areas. Having EVERY dead relative im my family vote. Twice. It was worth it. We just can't afford to have a dishonest Republican in the Governor's Mansion. Victory party @ the French Laundry tonight!! WOO-HOO!!!
At this point I’d just like to leave this once beautiful state and let it burn
Fantastic speech, but still a fool.
I condemn the media for giving so much play to to Newsom’s lies and benefactors (Barry, Joe & Arnie). He’s wrecked our schools, forests, businesses, health, water supply and sense of public morality. And STILL an ignorant public permits him to stay.
He didn’t lose!
This man makes too much sense , I knew California wouldn’t elect him
Elder’s mistake was that he thought  the majority of Californians want to improve their state.  The recall election proved otherwise
He got his panties kicked in his azz🤣
A black man with a white brain.
Newsome was  bought and paid for buy the crooks  of Hollywood just shows what goes on in elections
Elitist CA liberals rejoice! I’m leaving this shit hole state. It’s an embarrassment to humanity.
You conceited before the numbers were tabulated!!
Thank you, governor newsom! Thank you for always standing up for america!
So we're supposed to believe. That Joe Biden is the most popular man in America. And Gavin newsom is the most popular man in California.  It just really doesn't seem likely.
The Democrats worked on overtime to keep the Governorship.  It'd be politically embarrassing for them to lose the home state of both The Vice President and the Speaker of the House (who also happens to be Governor Newsom's aunt).   Could the recall be a warmup, for a Governors race in  2022 of Elder vs. Newsom?
Amen so true
I’ll back any politician who will seriously take care of this housing crisis in California from these incredibly overpriced rent to the inflated cost of buying a house.  Sick of it all
Dam why the good ones can't win. I wish you won Larry
Elders problem is he used trumps play book to much!!! You don't run in a state and 2 days before a vote is cast and claims it's rigged.. That doesn't work anymore. Especially in a blue state.. then the corvid California is pro mask and vaccine. He better forget about trump and come up with something different.
Californians deserve the sh**storm they voted themselves. The state is an embarrassment.
Translation from politi-speak to English;  We are forcing them to spend tax dollars on our power grab recall election, rather than schools or homeless people, you know, all of the things that have never been on any republican agenda.
He did'nt lose !
Yes.. 👏👏👏 But just sick over elec
California is a disaster place to living under democrats party so i guess it was fake election oh american and illigals voters love living in a third country
He could run again and actually get to embarrass Newsom in a debate.
He could run again and actually get to embarrass Newsom in a debate.
What a joke wake up america total discrase
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQPPfUN4F3QqHEuvK2rLxBcoYELHpHNcM
California had a chance to recover and pissed it away
Thanks... you did a great job of making Newsom a household name 👏
You knew it was fixed! We will never have an election again
Larry Elder’s parents raised a GREAT MAN! Thank you, Larry! I hope you run again! You would be a fantastic governor!
This idiot and his victim girlfriend...liar uncle larry...
As soon as the words "this will be cleanest election in California history" I knew he was going lose.
The "Republicans" had a chance to address all of the issues this puppet is mouth mocking back with Reagan
Speaking like a true loser😄😄😅😅
Nothing like most useless President ever, endorsing the most useless Governor ever. Shows just how gullible some people are.
All of the the republican voters already moved out of that state. All that’s left is libs.
What a liar. His opponent was born on third base? Newsom's mother worked three jobs and they didn't always get gifts on Christmas. They opened their home to foster children. His father would give away his earnings. Newsom worked several jobs in high school to support his family. These lies are the best conservatives have to offer?
California is slowing spreading to the east. Reno is feeling it. You also have to remember greety people love Californians moving in because they can pay more for a house. This is a problem that needs to be solved in California.
California deserves what it gets if it can't stand up and get it done.
Yes, your father was very right! Now stfu and disappear!
Mail-in ballots were intended for deployed military. Now anyone can use them. Here's the deal : If Grandma can wear her 4 foot in diameter hat to Easter service, then the lazy bitch can get one of her 22 nieces or nephews to take her to vote. And the voting parameters need tightening. If you are concerned about who is in charge of Britney's $$, or if Demi Lowvowto tried to whack herself again, you probably don't need to vote !!!
People continue to vote for candidates that are so deeply entrenched in the establishment and I don’t understand it…
POTUS/VPOTUS?
dumb ass you lost......huge!!
California likes being a shithole just like Chicago. Let those people suffer. They don't want to listen. Maybe California will burn up and an earthquake will suck it in
This guy is such a doof.
All I hear is a sad sore loser and the GQP party crying as usual for losing in a landslide 😂
trump speaks after losing the California recall.
Good luck CA. Newsome isn’t going fix anything.
California’s loss.
He would have been a disaster for this state or any state, he's a another Trump, a nightmare.
Humans simply can't tolerate change... Look at it on a small scale, working retail -in general cases we're groomed into accepting what we have, complacency
When the only way you could try to win was exploiting a loop hole in the impeachment process. That way someone with WAY less support has a chance to be governor.
Elders, go somewhere and sit down. Nobody cares you're not forcing anything; this is a multi-cultural state, & we don't prescribe to you or Trump's ideology. So, take your rhetoric & go away we don't need you or your kind here!!!!!! We're forward thinking ppl...This make America great nonsense works in the South not here.
Larry Elder, the guy who never had a chance, but wasted $300M in taxpayer dollars to pretend he had a chance.
California doesn’t have a chance with congress women like Maxine Waters and Pelosi !
"We believe in the dream of Martin Luther King" Just by the way, MLK was a very big advocate of socialism.
he is an idiot... rationalizig his LOSS... the pro confederate idiots LOST... they just never figured it out... tRUMP LOST...
California Counties that use Dominion: Alameda, Butte, Contra Costa, Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Fresno, Glenn, Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Marin, Mono, Monterey, Napa, Placer, Plumas, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sonoma, Sutter, Tehama, Tulare, Tuolumne, Ventura, and Yuba. 39 counties among 58 counties (67%) use Dominion. Question is do we have 100% trust in Dominion??
Oh Larry! When will you learn?
Nothing like denying a black man a position as governer while BLM and Antifa cry about equal rights
I guess Californians don’t care how they are treated.  The “rules” apply to the “regular” people, but not Newsom.  Californians must like high taxes, failing schools, must like being unemployed, like homelessness, like unaffordable housing, like lockdowns, and like all the services paid for by taxpayers going to no citizens.  I am not optimistic that the lives of Californians will improve.
Your father was wrong Those who CHEAT win
He did not get recall cuz there was no option to replace him really
I was surprised when I vote in person that they don't ask for my ID.  So in Cali anyone can vote.
The load of Bullshhhitt this guy spews is impressive.  But it's still Bullshhhitt.
Larry you didn’t lose brother... Pelosi stole it from you with fraudulent ballots. Proud of you.
Whining brats are going to call 'election fraud' on every lose they get for the rest of time. Babies.
The DNC controls all aspects of CA's election process, they could run a bag of dog shit and win easily.
Great news for the middle class of CA! You can still enjoy high rates of violent crime, high taxes, completely unaffordable real estate, drought, and out of control wildfires. But that is not all! Rampant homelessness, public defecation and discarded hypodermic needles lining your streets are all yours to keep! Congratulations
If I was conservatives, businesses and Republicans I would relocate let liberals and democrats live in the over taxed sh!+ hole
Not two but twenty years ago!!!
What about the other 42 legitimate contenders, Lar?
Californians must hate their state.
California should just turn Red and see how it goes it can’t get worse with the people in power right now .
He didn’t lose the recall election, we the people did.
California just got dumber
Everyone who would have voted for Larry moved out months ago haha
Your a  Larry running your mouth on a radio station does not make you ready for Government
Good speech but there is a reason why Gavin Newsom won
I think Republicans should get out of California not if but when it falls into the ocean we don’t want to lose no good people
We lost the battle but won the war??? Wtf 🤬 🤬🤬🤬
I'm glad Texas will not let Dominion machines in.
As a liberal would say “ if you voted for Gavin you’re a racist”
You'll never be able to vote out the criminals ever again.
People of calif deserve what they get! They are BLIND OR BOUGHT!
Audit
C’mon man..you know it’s guaranteed win…he went against potato head, camel’s toe, and negative crooked Nancy…they’re experts at winning…I mean cheating..
There is a God.
Pack your bags up 0 minimum wager! How can you run on that and no mask mandates or vaccine mandates and ban abortions in the state and really expect to WIN an election!😂🤣again you cons are on the wrong side of the 80/20 issues😂🤣keep it up we live it!
Thank goodness he lost, he was and remains an absolute joke just another Donald Trump clown & court jester.
I left California 4 years ago, but I have been a cheerleader for Mr. Elder.  He's the one person who could actually make a difference in that state.
I’m not sure if people in Comifornia  really that stupid or Democrats did another election
Nothing like the death rattles of the dying Qpublikkklans! #Tre45on get outta here!
Need to demand a recount
Certified weirdos
Mail in BALLOTS?
All you had to do was offer every struggling Californian money 💰  I guess Newsoms budget tactics worked.
I'm laughing at republicans thinking they can still win elections in deep blue states after 2020. Stop it. Don't even bother voting. You are wasting your time.
Love this guy
Elder for president 👀
I'm sure it was rigged just like the last presidential election!
Damn better luck next time.
Its utter B.S. How the hell did Gavin Newsom get put on the ballot for a recall in the first place! Californians put him in a recall for his abuse of power etc. So wtf happened? These people didnt waste money & at the last minute changed their minds. The money is what kept him as governor not the people. No one here in CA wants him as governor its lies & full of sh*%. How do we know for certain that our votes were actually counted & not corrupted or thrown out in the trash. Anyone who feels cheated by the system by our leaders should not obey or conform to a dictatorship. Dont give up ur freedoms & rights. CA is a loss to save. Its the most greediest toilet hell to live in. Dont come here unless u wanna suffer greatly.
A man who wakes up every morning hating the fact he's Black. His remedy is going through life cuddling with white, populous xenophobes who don't even care about him. Self hatred runs deep among conservatives - especially the Black ones.
Keep giving it to them and we will never win
tax all evangelicals they are evil
Cleaning the Forrest, Really !!!!!!! Wow you Magatards are something else. By the way now you guys are voting for a black dude?  You guys supposed to be racist, common. Nothing against black people here, just trying to figure out Magatards.
Glutens for punishment
If you hate Cali than leave. By all means, let me grab the door for you. If you love Cali and wish for a different outcome, I respect that and I respect you. Bitching and complaining does nothing.
no big surprise here   the mail-in ballots decided another election
What happened to 300k votes disappearing last nite ???
All those people in the crowd are like “what’s that black dude talking about? Where’s our candidate”? Lol
If you voted for Newsome; you are racist!
with all your respect mr. Elder go back to wherever hole you came from , this is California not Texas 🤷🏻‍♂️ we as Californians may not be perfect but our state is the most beautiful state of this awesome country !!!
Elder didn’t have enough felons transporting completed ballots to drop boxes on his behalf. California didn’t need that white supremacist anyway. Thank goodness they still have that rich white man as governor. Can’t wait to see what new edicts he has in store for his populace after meeting with his lobbyists at the French Laundry!
The petite adult sicily educate because daisy behaviorally imagine during a rough shade. hard-to-find, barbarous cherries
Men walk up to him crying, and saying "now you give us hope",  and him alone is going to end homeless-ness, been a politician for a few weeks,  How am I  doing?  Stay tuned!   Shit! This moron is in the wrong business he's tele-evangelist material and real good potential to become a millionaire.
Stay tuned for what. More singing dancing and lying 🤥
Pretty sure the election was the war but ok sure.
IM SORRY CALIFORNIA...WILL BE PRAYING FOR YOU...
So glad you lost.
I spoke with a couple of family members yesterday and they intended on going to the polls. TO VOTE FOR YOU!  However, once they heard you start saying yesterday that it was basically POINTLESS for them to exercise their right fo vote, bc instead of handling POTENTIAL defeat, you decided to “SET UP” the whole “tHeY cHeAtEd” trope—they just didn’t vote at all.  They figured you knew what you were talking about and were so busy at work that it just didn’t give them any confidence that even if they voted, it would matter.   What you effectively did, was convinced many republicans and others who intended to vote for you to not even bother.   You wouldn’t have been crying that BS if the polls showed you far in the lead and you know that.  Without the whole “TheY ArE gOiNg To ChEaT!” yesterday, just as DJT did in November, you may have had more success.   Instead, you convinced even more republicans that voting isn’t going to even make a difference.  WHAT A FU&KING SHAME! Now? We are stuck with Gavin.
California deserves to burn to the ground for reelecting that moron
Larry, Your pathetic & allowed the people to get robbed. All the people who worked for you & donated. They will do nothing. Larry soon as you seen mail n ballots where they can cheat & republicans getting  turned away at the poles, YOU SHOULD OF BEEN WATCHING BUT YOUR TO BLIND.
California is doomed.
As usual the demonrats cheat in another election - this will be resolved and all gone to jail or hang - along with the idiots that run this paper - err toilet paper company
Losing has become common for the Republican Party. They’re out of touch with mainstream society.
I mean with mail in ballots how did you expect to win like it's a normal election? As long as those exist im sure it's easy to falsify a win. As soon as I heard mail in ballots were going to exist, I knew the recall was over.  I gave up on California and moved out last year.
Lol what a schmuck! He got creamed by Gavin and his 400 pounds of hair gel! What’s up with that crazy looking Barbie doll in the background?
Larry did not loose California, it was taken from him.
there mo .. they stole the votes
War world 3 was predicted this year!!!
family members went to vote and told me they were told they already voted, boy are they pissed.
CALIFORNIA LOVE TO LARRY ELDER!!! THE REAL CHAMPION, FAIR AND SQUARE!!!
Bra this world. Mass up bra teacher. We all to wear it bra white and black
Pathetic
California its a a p.s with demonrats
I'm still waiting on a massive earthquake to take that shithole off the map with all these dumbass, low IQ democrats with it.
Burn California down.
Get in loser! We’re going to lose the election by a landslide- Trump to Elder
They won't do a better job they don't care and they have the audacity to say "locals matter"
newsome only won because of the help of his rich auntie, and hollyweird
The only truth he said was look in the mirror…you fucking clown!!!…
Kinda hard to believe he didn’t see this coming… lol he was born in the dugout and he’s still sitting on the bench lmao  I love how he says he doesn’t divide by race after saying Newsom was born on 3rd base! Why? Because he’s white? Lol black ppl may not be able to b racist, but prejudice looms large in black communities.  I voted for Newsom over Elder not because Elder is black but because Newsom is simply a better politician. Hands down.
My husband and I got sent two ballots to each of us! And we were at DMV a month before the election getting a "Real ID" and now we got double ballots! Imagine what is going on...🤦🏻‍♀️ I don't get how it was going to take a month until we can get the results and now in a two hours after the lection "we know that we lost the battle" 🧐 something don't match up!
It was rigged
“We lost the battle but we’ll win the war” I don’t like the use of that phrase against fellow Americans.
Such a shame. Larry is so much better of a person than gruesome newsome
Larry Elder is a total hack. He's all hot air and oppurtunism. Not a fan. He's been dislikeable for years. So much co-towing to white supremiscists is insulting to those of us with real awareness.
Clearly, California is not ready for Larry Elder and they aren't ready for change. I had two assumptions about this election. 1. If Larry elder won, that would be a sign that even the progressives are having their eyes opened by the harsh realities of bad Democrat policies that have never resolved any issues for decades. If Larry could save California, he would well be on his way to save our great country. 2. If Larry lost, then too many sensible people left California during the Great Exodus in 2019. Additionally, voter fraud is rampant in California; resulting in continued Democrat power in the state. I hoped Larry would win, but I doubted it. The only positive thing about this is that more than double the amount of signatures needed to recall Gavin was achieved. Because of that, Gavin may not win the next election. Knowing Californians, they are not keen supporters of individual freedoms and small government, and they love to listen mindlessly to celebrities, the MSM, and "good intentioned" Democrat politicians; so it's unlikely a Republican (not a RINO) will be elected anytime soon.
That's some rigged bullshit
This guy is a Trump proxy. What clown.
Biden sucks,,klamidia sucks harder
THANK GOD WE DONT NEED ANOTHER GUY WHO ANSWERS TO TRUMP TAKE THAT CLOWN SHOW ELSEWHERE
CLOWN!
Biden called him a Trump clone hahaha that’s funny . I don’t see Trump or any of his cohorts ever getting in office as well as his family . After what happened with Trumps presidency & how people seen right through it I don’t see any republicans becoming President any time soon neither , people are waking up to how the Republican Party are trying to run this country & are getting wise to how corrupt they are & how there only for them selfs & not the people . George Washington didn’t want a 2 party house or a to party senate he wanted the country’s leaders to come together as one unit .
You're not forcing California to do anything. They're forcing you out. You lost. Not because of political values or moral values, you lost because Democrats care more about what team you're on then they care about empowering black Americans. If you doubt me do some research into the racist comments of Joe Biden. Democrats think African Americans are too dumb to read and write, they think mainstream African Americans are dirty and inarticulate. Remember Joe Biden got the most votes is the history of the US. EVERY democrat had to come out and vote for him for him to get those numbers. EVERY democrat. So do you think they truly care about racism in America? No, they ARE the racist party in America. The same party from 1900 to 2021. Nothing has changed but the words they use.
Larry you didn't have a CHANCE when joe and haris pelosi and the LEFT  got involved   just like 2020 election    GOD will have JUSTICE over EVERYTHING
Lol! Now you can have all the George Zimmerman's living your neighborhood that you want.  He's your Republicans
Maybe you should knock on the doors of those that went to vote and we're told they already had voted
Don't forget he believes slave owners deserved reparations since the government took their "property"
So much confirmation bias in these comments. If you want better results, present better candidates and alternatives instead of spewing partisan aspersions, excuses, and hollow platitudes. It isn't a "leftist" or "right wing" problem, it's an apathetic constituency that would rather whine as a crowd than do their due diligence to fix their own neighborhoods.  I must also say how hilarious the conspiracy talk is. As I hear it, conservatives seem to think that Democrats have an all-powerful, all-reaching ability to influence the course of elections and legislation that is so pervasive, it must be present in absolutely every place that a conservative loses. For a "do nothing" party, they seem to be capable of doing quite a bit at a high level. How does that work again?
Rigged
It's sad that the best California could do is Larry Elder and Gavin Newsom.
Amen 🙏🏻 for our country
A lot of you Larry haters know very little about him and it shows when you state he had hollow promises when addressing things like rising costs of CA and the homeless population. He's had multiple interviews tackling these issues and addresses that he would revoke laws that have make it harder to buy land, or to construct lower costing/quality buildings in CA from the previous leaders that gained money from upping land regulations for higher priced buildings and buisnesses in order to get away with higher taxes. Everyone knows taxes are based off of incomes, and if you keep everyday people from creating lower end buildings in high demand areas the retail price for that local land stays high. Ensuring only people who can pay such prices stays in that area to where lower in come groups are forced out of that area for the rich to buy up the land that has now been priced up too high for lower class and middle class. The rich flip the land for their own desires and this continues like some disgusting assimilation for larger cities. This is why people move to smaller towns.
The hopelessness of CA remains. Flee the state. You will always have bad politicians, who care more about enriching themselves than in helping their people. Wake up Calis before your state becomes the worst place to live.
Is it possible that Larry Elder won, but the voting system is still broke and cheating happened again, causing him to "lose"?
This "us vs. them" narrative is so very tiresome.  First this guy goes on and on about how "we"  (Republicans, conservatives) are "forcing" "them" (those evil, heartless Democrats) to look at all issues that are glaringly apparent to all.   For example: one would have to be both blind and deaf not to notice how many people are living in tents or in their cars all over the West Coast right now!  Then he send the rest of his speech claiming to be such a uniter!  Sir, you do not win any points with all the holier-than-thou talk about how your Daddy taught you the value of hard work bla bla bla. - This is no different from what most parents try to teach their kids.  Maybe shock jocks work hard?  Certainly no harder than the maids and CNAs and waittresses that are having to live on the street right now because people like you "don't believe in" the minimum wage.
Thank You Larry, See You in the Next Campaign
Calofornia is destroyed by liberal tyrants.  People have to do their best to not allow total dictatorship.
I'm so shocked the black face of white supremacy lost in California.....
Blah, blah, blah....Elder, you didn't do shit. No one cares about your right-wing ideas in California. Just like practically every other right-winger, you flip-flopped all over the place for expediency and have no principles. Try running elsewhere, perhaps.
I love how the Dems always cheat their way to power. Like if they are so caring and saying all the crap they do about the little person, why cheat? Actions should show not lies
If you didn't have your face up trump's a$$ might have won
I guess no sleazy trump in Sacramento.
Deuces
sir , dont be a token for djt
You know what? Californians are happy,they don't want change
Newson cheated .We are proud of you Larry.
Elder for Governor 2022
California is too stupid to save.
Newsom won and California lost. Don’t come to my state when shit hits the fan. We don’t want you.
Larry Elder is full of shit. That's about it.
Soon cheating will be normal. Why bother to vote? By the way, you already voted.
Loser
Seven or Eight weeks Politicians, is that All the training they Need??
What happened to all the voter fraud you loser?
And we are to believe it was honest? Aaaaaàant!
Here is an idea Larry; why don't you run in the general election next year so you can really understand that California doesn't need or want any version (black or white) of Donald Trump.  You will be severely trounced in a general election.  In the meantime, why don't you just STFU.
Get use to these Republican party losing speeches. They lost the majority of the votes its over for Republican. Trump couldnt win no1 can. Tud Cruz is washed up.
Can't control outcome, I like that
So disappointed.  Thought Elder had this one. All I can say is, Wyoming, here I come!
wait a minute, wasn't this the war, the battle was getting the recall done. so he won a battle then lost the war.
They cheated  again! You know them city people all steal. Except for Larry, one of the few good ones like Smiln Tim Scott , Dr. Carson, Justice Thomad and OJ Simpson.
Larry Elder!!! Thank you for stepping up and making Newsom pretend to campaign...never an issue discussed, just attacks on you and DJT. Life will never change if men and women of character like you do not step up to lead. Thank you and God bless you.
How do the people vote for politicians that ruin them , makes no sense ….
Mr. Elder needs to go back home and look in the mirror
Forcing them? From the people who claim, can’t force to take vaccine… confused?
Larry Elder retired with dignity.  You are not going anywhere.
You deserve a government you voted for 😤 The rest leave that state or get involve in school board , local political seats and fight with these corrupt people .
How about those votes that disappeared?
The largest addition of homelessness folk was when Ronald Reagan closed the mental institutions
I like the raise a man part. Thanks for trying.
I like this guy...
Eddie Guerrero's theme song is also the Democrats theme song
obviously this guy is a trumper through and through; 🙄remember when trump recommended California 'sweeping the forest' to prevent fires 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When did Clayton Bigsby get his sight back?  https://youtu.be/BLNDqxrUUwQ
I'm sad to see this outcome, Larry! You would have been so good for the state.
Have always been a Liberal BUT..I hope the frustration that Newsome experienced is a wake up call.
All those poor slave owners who won't get another reparation check..... So sad /s
They forced you to realize that loud mouthed idiots like you mean nothing to this State
Your parents raised a black trump
Gavin Newsom is the real white supremacist.
That Inside Edition piece made our poor Larry Elder look like a sex freak, oh well.  Somebody now queue up Junior Walker's "Way Back Home"
Sorry your not the winner! I was super excited about the idea of you being Govenor    I love this state but it's turned into a hell hole I want to run away from.
They cheated in the president election what makes everyone think they didn't cheat here i registered to track my vote they said they got it and was counted then 2 days later they said I didn't vote what a bunch of crap
Maybe Republicans should stop running Trump clones across the country if they ever want to win 🤷🏻‍♂️
Did they really think Nancy's nephew would lose Elder probably won to bad there is no fairness in voting anymore why bother
if we don't fix election 2020 then we will never win, cheat and cheat is in Democrat's blood. Election need ID required, need registration required. If not, California forever under Communist DemoCRAT and soon to be USA.
I voted yes on the recall and voted for Denver stoner well I guess that didn’t work out
All the voters who said no deserve shitty govt and corrupt state politics……the voters don’t want change so be it…..stay in California
love his crowdwork. "how many y'all like sex?"
Biden flies to California bofore election, why? To go coerce people in power to make it go a particular way.
The team that has corrupt referee on their site always win. What a joke.  The man that talks nonsense wins the election??
Ahahahha u didn't do anything for us California's elder calm down.. forcing nothing but are taxpayer money to be spended for this dumb recall election.. wasted all this money for NOTHING.. could have ended homelessness or atleas done something instead of wasting the money on this clown
As long as california remains a democratic shithole, all the good states will remain red states, because they all have a good example of what NOT to be.😂😅😄😂
If anyone thinks for a minute that Cali Democrats are listening , you are crazy
I’ve been a Republican for 7 weeks. How am I doing?  Well, Larry. Not too well by the looks of everything.
Like I said before DEMOCRATSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  are like a mafia they will make sure no one that is out of their circle joins in. They fear of an outsider finding out their crookedness!
He was never going to win anyway
Congratulations for winning the election Larry elder
When our president and vice president  put their  hands on it, Newsom always win, the country should celebrate all year round.
Not forcing them to do shit.
Once again, Democrats flagrantly steal an election. There were hardly any more “yes” votes than signatures for the recall. They really do think we’re stupid.
Well I guess California is doomed to be a shit hole. Good luck
Communism full throttle so stupid !!! Silicon JERKS and Hollywierd rules the rest struggle.  Larry is to good for them...🤔🤫!!
Not surprised he didn't win..the dems are shady
Wow I guess Gavin is doing great things there 🙂
>You get out of life what you put into it >You cannot control the outcome  One of these things doesn't belong!
California will be the first state to collapse, don’t come running to red states seeking jobs etc and bringing your politics. We’ll gladly remove you.
I'm not gonna watch this a-hole. He's a Trumper, so he supports a liar who tried to force his way into an unelected 2nd term. That's a grotesque level of dishonesty and violates the US Constitution.
CORRUPT ELECTION
Another day, another rigged election.
Larry elder probably won the Democrats have cheated in everything they've done
Was it a FAIR election? What about those that were told they already voted? Everyone sees what a mess California is.
They wont do anything about  the homeless or anything. Dont fool yourself. Need to escape California while you still can.
“I’m a Zionist” - Joe Biden https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1vDx-5b7T8M If you don’t yet know what a Zionist is, just AshkeNAZI😅😂😂😂😮😮😮😮😮😅😅😅😅😅
All the good Californians are GONE 🤣
at least he admits he lost.
Larry is a true hero. Came from nothing to have everything and yet dominion still wins.
70% of voters West San Fernando Valley told they couldn’t vote because someone mailed in a fraudulent ballot in their name. We can’t change anything until We take the mail in ballot fraud away from the democrats.
California is absolute TRASH! Keep that shit hole state!
...and if we don't win the war, we will say the democrats cheated and stole the war.
Once again Californians did own grave …
California you Deserve the downfall you’re such idiots in that state.
A lot of voters would prefer all the crap that is going on than to cross-party line to vote for someone that might actually clean up the mess.
Why don’t you force the unmask to get the vaccine and mask up so others won’t die. I don’t care about them because they don’t care about themselves and children.
It's only cheating if you lose. Seems like great logic.
California is die-hard Democrat,  Any attempt by California Republican is utter waste of time.  Focus on something attainable.
It’s strange to me that people are complaining so much about homelessness right now.  Ever since I was little California has had a very large homeless population.  This isn’t a current issue.  You’ve had numerous republican men in power that never did anything about it.  So why is it suddenly a huge issue that has to be solved now.  Why not then?
Larry Elder, u are delusional.
Larry didn’t lose...California did
People don't realize that all the amazing stories we have heard about California came from a time when it was completely controlled by Republicans.
Amazing how people are willing to live in a shit hole, the get what they deserve and will have to live with it.
Shut up and congratulate your opponent. That will show that you are a real man.
I wish more “politicians” were like Elder.
We see you.  Go home, retire.  Repent.
If that was a concession speech, I wonder how long his victory speech would have lasted.
Larry Elder is a fool.
Lol it’s funny because his followers don’t give two shits about homelessness, climate crisis, the forests, or any of that shit
I can't believe Californians want their state to stay like a third world country. Anyway, congratulations to all who voted Newsom, you deserve it and to the people who voted Larry Elder, you deserve a better state so get out if you want!!!
I feel sorry for black conservatives and libertarians. They have to put up with so much racism and hatred from the "tolerant" left who constantly tell them they have to tokenise themselves.
Another rigged election smfh! Hopefully another Earth quake will wipe California out
So sad… you would of been a great Governor
Just shut up sore loser!  Go cry to your orange master.
This is a real landslide 67% to 33% more than double the votes and 2022 will be similar
I can't believe Californians voted for the same sh.it I can't believe this country voted for dementia joe. Why are we letting these politicians destroy our country?
I would just like to point out, Larry Elder, the man who was born and raised in Compton was called the black face of white supremacy by Gavin Newsom, a man who has lived his entire life a millionaire.
How can we force this idiot off the air!!!
🥱
California will crumble into obscurity now!
Elder is a broken McDonald's Happy Meal toy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😥😥😥😥😥 POOR THING!!!!!
Let Kalifornia BURN
Keep in mind that these same Democrat Californians that re-elected Gavin “The Tyrant” Newsom are the same ones who love to cry about “racism” and how black ppl and black politicians are always put underneath the white man. Remember this everybody, The hypocrites strike again!!!
It would seriously serve RINO's good and proper if, after all their efforts to destroy democracy in America, the Democrats cancelled the next election and decided to stay in power instead.  Listen to them bitch whine then!
Y’all just need to get out of California bro, we don’t want y’all here trust 🤣🤣🤣
Gavin Newsom is the worst governor in the history of this country after Andrew Cuomo. How does an epic failure like him remain in office? Wait, let me ask Joe Biden.
I was born and raised in California. I am so sorry what has happened to our beautiful state. I too will be forced to leave my beloved California. I cannot afford to retire here. I am so sorry for my state and our beautiful country because we are doomed 💔💔💔
Aye aye aye Good BYE ✌🏽
California knows how to party.
Frump Jr
This guy never stood a chance against a RIGGED system..You can't win when the outcome is already pre-determined by the powers that be. A football team cannot win when the referees are fixed, the other team is on steroids & the other teams has your playbook ahead of the game, IMPOSSIBLE.
i like how he talks like the contest is still going on. you lost bucko. take the L. quit acting like you're still in it lmao
Good try, Larry you doing great job.
LOL! What a tool!
California corruption.
Homelessness? Schools? Forest Clearing? Energy? Oh, you mean the things republicans couldn’t care less about except when it’s election time? Give me a break. I’ve never heard a Republican/“Conservative” talk about those issues at length other than we should cut funding for all those types of programs. Then they turn around and falsely claim “government doesn’t work”. Well, not if you govern like right wing idiots it doesn’t. Go away Elder.
People who support Newsom suffer from various mental disorders including but not limited to Stockholm syndrome,  cognitive dissonance,  trump derangement syndrome,  and a disease called leftism.  They feed the crocodile hoping it eats them last.
How did your BS recall go REPUBTARDS???
Democrats stole it as usual nothing to see here folks
No forest fires are real. It's all burnout warfare. Homelessness is by design with all the Vatican and Royal family dope allowed into the country every day
Dude, was cheated out of the election.
What a sack of shit
Death to the democratic party
BLA BLA BLA... WWE BLA BLA BLA.... slither back to your SWAMP, Larry... California IS NOT TEXAS OR FLORIDA!!
Sad day
Larry, we love you, we thank you, we support you, we stand by you, and we await to see where we are all going next.  Do not quit!!!!
Conservatives need to vote with their $$$... get out of California.  Move out of the cities and into conservative 'towns'.  These people have all our tax dollars and they are attacking us with our own money.
Dominion won.
Sad day
Bless Elder and his family, they can move to  NC. We'll welcome them with open arms.
Dammit
Marxist government in control of Washington and Commiefornia.  The useful idiots who vote Newsome did not outnumber Patriots for Elder. It was rigged 100% and numerous instances of Republicans showing up to vote and told they already voted.
You were Given Harvey Dent in black and you cast him aside. I'm not even religious but may your god have mercy on you when they spill over whatever it is the Left is cooking.
Bla. Bla bla. , Looser. ,go home to cry ,
I'm glad Newsom retained his seat. Had he been voted out, Elder would have been put in the impossible position of trying to save California in the face of a Democrat-controlled Legislature. Lef Newsom take California the rest of the way to total ruin and chaos.
Good speach !!! Now go and be a consultant for TRUMP...he doesn't get it !!! Stop kissing up to Trump and keep on working ...What you say is awesome now start doing what you just said !
Democrat's have declared war on white Americans all across our nation it is a war and its starting to turn violent
Californians are gonna keep their awful governor in office, then move to other states when things continue to get worse in their own state lol
RIGGED !! RIGGED RIGGED!!! CORRUPTION ELECTION!! THERES NO WAY THAT CROOK NOOSUM WON!!!! HELL NO! SATAN IS FOOLIN YOU ALL!!!
Say what ever you want!!! Change nothing 👎👎👎
California's problem's are AMERICA'S PROBLEM'S every state has the same problems
He didnt lose the Gubernatorial recall, he never had a chance, we voted NO to the recall, not yes, then somebody else, NO as in NO we don't want it!
Mail in votes allow lazy morons that wouldn’t have otherwise voted vote. That’s why Democrats love it. They know the average retard will vote for them
This BS
6.9 Subscribers lol
THANK GOD
They scamed election again WTF 70 vs 30 no f way they want you  believe that more people want vaccines and kids with mask yeah right
Let California burn. This is not the plan of man, but that of the Creator. Do not be deceived for God will not be mocked. Stand tall Larry. People can see the difference between dark and light regardless of skin color. God knows.
Larry elder belong to jail
California have to fix there voting system first
YOU ARE A LOSER....... and  don't like losers...
Much respect to Larry Elder.  He’s a great man.
We love you Larry, you are so inspiring and so right!! You are the best and most gracious man, you are wonderful!!!!!
Dear Republicans:  please explain to me how it is that if elections are being rigged it is only Democrats who are doing it.  Am I supposed to believe that Repubs are too honest to do so?  Or is it that they don't know how?
CA was and is continuing to be F-cked. So glad I left that hell hole.
So sorry you didn't win. You will win the war!!🇺🇸
What did the people of California expect? I mean come on people u kept the same voting machines. U got this outcome because u didn't change the machines!
This dude is a bum. Well Larry I guess you didn’t work hard enough
"Elder 2024, because Republicans love crazy more than they hate Blacks, and I'm crazier than a shithouse rat."
Democrats stole another election. Rigged elections strike again....
Oh shut up all ready. Put your money where your mouth is. It takes a village, town, city and metropolis to reduce all your complaints. Work together and get it done.
Run for president please 💙🙏🙏
the new agents of racist propaganda machines are the White Baptist churches of America. They have turned Christianity which is the religion of love into a religion of segregation hate and division Blasphemous churches they have become the Church of the devil himself Who oppress the poor the migrant and the destitute  and stand and embrace and support capitalism with all of its gluttony.
We lost, but I’m going to spin so lies until you believe them.
There still needs to count ballots sent in by mail.... right ?
You cut off the beginning, where he said "we recognize we lost the war, I mean we recognize we lost the battle"
Larry Elder didn’t lose. We the people did.
California is dead.
When republicans take back the house and we rub it in your fascist communist crybaby faces, you will do a Jan 6th and call it a peaceful protest lol. “Rules for thee but not for me” far leftist ❄️
He won it's just a damn rigged system
Larry should've come out. California loves that.
Larry Elder went on about being raised a Man. How to be a Man ,  let's see if he lets the  outsiders influence him to whine about an unfair election resulting in his one sided loss. Lets watch and see.
If the TRAITOR RepubliKKKan Party "wins the war" it would be terrible for the planet, the economy, the country, the state, and for every single person. You don't "unite" when you try to make Trump into our dictator.
He needs to get out there and help to clean up that forest!
People will never own anything there with a democrat mind set voting for big government taking more of there money
This is a sad day for California.
Its time for EVERYONE REGISTERS AS DEMOCRAT.  screw the labels.  REGISTER DEMOCRAT NO MATTER WHAT
Humblemumble...IM SURE THIS GUY WON...YOU KNOW THEY STOLE IT...AGAIN
larry     dont give it up          they cheated anyway and we know it!
California !!! Elder is a true man !!! I can’t believe that you would not vote for this man !!! True American !!!!
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT.  BULLSHIT.  BULLSHIT
Damn look at the smear campaign they ran against elder and they said he would not concede and said it was voter fraud already.  None of that was true.
my concern is less with that he lost, but more with how the vote was executed.  Was it fair?  Of course we are hearing rumors of peoples votes not being counted or told they already voted.  Scary that we may be looking at another unfair election, horrible national implications,  I truly hope not.
You know they cheated their asses off
Republicans worried about homelessness? Hmm
I don’t think so!
If a State won't elect Larry Elder. They are truly rooted in evil. Larry Elder stands for great wisdom and logic. Stands for great morals and true freedom. Its sad to see that he wasn't elected. I dont usually care about elections because they are usually trash people all around. But i was really rooting for Larry. California and New Yorl are gonna be the worst states to live. Wait, they already are smh
I’m confused. Where was the “voter fraud” claim? Didn’t he blame his loss on voter fraud the day before the election?  How can a guy who doesn’t believe in a minimum wage even mention the name Martin Luther King Jr? King was assassinated in Memphis, TN supporting a Sanitation Workers strike. That was workers rights King was supporting. Things may be bad in Cali, but Elder’s not a force for constructive change, just destructive change.
Almost like the only solution is lyrics from System of a down Pluck
I lived there for almost a year, (always wanted to, because of the sun) got there and it was a shit hole......bums on every corner, pan handling, high prices.....hard to get medical, and it poured rain all of the time......I have also lived in WA and AZ  but CA was the worst....
All of the emotional liberals are saying "conservative tears will fix the drought" and I'm here thinking no. Elders proposal to establish more desalination water treatment plants would have, because it's almost unlimited water from our oceans. As a young 18 year old, I was democratic, I'm 26 years old, and I realized that nothing drastic has gotten done....
Positive things are happening... The Best is Yet to Come
I was saying this from the beginning that they pulled a trump election on us. Arnold said it : F your freedom!!! 😡😡😡
Good riddance, blackface
No election will be legal until the illegally votes are stopped!
Went to vote......they advised me that I had already voted....I was escorted off property.....dam corrupt COMUNIST PIGS 💯.....I have my Ballot in front of me!!!!!!!!!
The only thing Martin Luther King Jr. said that Republicans fully stand by is that "[t]his country has socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor." And they'll do whatever they can to keep it that way!
The poll has been tallied. Result: 62% of Californians are gossip believing mongers, are gullible and oblivious to obvious lies deceit and deceptions, are clueless patsies in a land of evil and don't even recognize that "they are the target".
You lost when you lost the Bipartisan Effort to a Republican Take over.
F this guy.
good speech but still Trump loyalist . California don't want him .
It really sucks that this man didn’t succeed. There’s no hope for Commieville
Let Cali go to hell
California dumb asses vote for newsom and your poor lol wake the F up Democrats are taking you lol you will never own anything with that mind set
Larry Elder, don't forget, we only lost the vote about whether to run the election. That doesn't mean that California doesn't like you. Run again next election. Maybe you will be chosen.
Thank goodness this butt kissing trump hustler didn't make it. At least he accepted defeat, unlike that whacko loser trump.
Californians, you did it to yourself again. When are you going to open your eyes to see how living in California has degraded ? Homelessness, crime, poor education, high property prices, etc.
Did he lose‼️
That was a long "I lost" speech...
You are embarrassment to every black man woman and child around the world Please do not come around black people anymore stay with the ones you worship the racist white people.
Let it 🔥
No lost just stone in the road. Hammer time.
“Wrong does not cease to be wrong because the majority share in it.” ― Leo Tolstoy, A Confession  People think just because more people believe in something that it makes it true.  More CA people voted for the guy who has lied and drenched in corruption and fraud.  Does that mean they were right?  But that's how democracy works.  2 wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner.  Truth does not need the support of the majority of people to make it true.
Very gracious. Good speech. Some people in the comment section should actually listen to him on how to deal with bad things. Class act
Thank God he is not are governor! We could’ve ended up like Florida or Texas or one of those other Republican governor states, they really don’t care about their citizens do they?
I’m gonna take a page from the Democrat handbook here: They are all racist for not voting for the black man. How could they not support him cause he’s black
When has voting out tyranny ever worked?
California is a mess thanks to years of Democrats and leftist policies.
Hurray for California!!!! You made an AWESOME statement by sending this sick SORRY SOB home!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Just goes to show how many dumb ass liberals are in the state. 🤢🤮☠ California needs God!🙏
You did not lose you got cheated... They cheat to win.
Sweet Jesus. 64% of the people who voted rejected the recall. This Trump wannabe couldn't force his blow up doll to do the pow chika pow wow no matter how hard he tries. Actually he's a little better than the Orange Nimrod he admitted that he lost.
Crazy thing he is not saying voting was fraudulent
If it was so easy to cheat on a Presidential election, this election was a piece of cake!
Newsome does not care about anything other then his own political outcome to be President one day the guys as crooked as old ass creepy auntie PELOSY Drain the Swamp
The democrats always cheat. I'm sure they stole this election also.
California deserves Gavin
It’s amazing how quick it was known that he lost. Literally less than 24hrs. Voters had already voted without even voting. If that doesn’t tell you something then we’re completely hopeless
No, you mean he LIES after losing the California Gubernatorial Recall Election.
I standing with you Elder love your speech
NOW THAT NEWS SON WON CAN CALIFORNIANS GO BACK TO CALI AND GET OUT OF TEXAS?
California for years and decades has been screaming to succeed from the United States ----believe me we want you to go !
Nice guy, but he ran in the wrong state.
What a crock of crap!
Wait, so Newsom won again? Damn, I really had faith for California for a second.
Americans don't elect losers.
Ok I’m not much of a conspiracy theorist but I would say this election felt rigged. I don’t understand how Newsom won by a landslide and the results came in only 45 minutes after the polls closed.
He’s a great example of Sell-out
This guy is Trash lmao
Thank you Mr Elder you are a true patriot! God bless you and your family!!!
Go back to broadcasting!
It's unfortunate that corruption is winning as of late..but the truth will come out
Stolen again
Dear Larry, you walked around constantly telling people how much you hate them and they saw through your lies. The rejected you for the fascist scumbag you are.
“Rigged system”
Hey Californians please  don't move no one likes you..
Sorry Mr. Elder!
Now the liberal Democrats want to change the way you vote for a recall election ! These people are vile disgusting ! Communists !
no not really, Newsome won easily, similar margin to the loss Drumpf had.
Producers will continue to move out and those that produce nothing will grow.
Democrats outnumber Republicans in ,-California more than 2 to 1.   Of course it wasn’t rigged.
Loser.
This is shameful I can't even listen to this crap.
A republican using overarching liberal talking points and talking about uniting while pushing election fraud - yeah ok
"many many men came up to me crying saying they now had hope"...the dude even stole trumps shtick
Go away, Elder!
Why don't you just wear white sheet You are a traitor to all black people around the world. Why don't you bleach your skin white wear blonde wig and blue contact lenses from now on. I frankly don't care about politics but the comment you made on national TV saying white slave owner should be compensated that  shows what kind of  disgusting despicable warm you are. I know a good job for you be a a supervisor of a plantation house That is more of a fitting job for you than a governor Trader
Hey Larry, give Candace Owen's a call! You two should get along just fine....
Another election stolen by the dirty left.
After "losing" due to cheating. There....fixed it for ya.
God bless you Larry!  Hang in there for the next election. America needs you!
With all the witnessed fraud, why is nobody doing anything about it. Changing numbers live on tv, stolen ballots, 70% of Republican voters told they already voted when the went to the polls, etc. 🤬🤬
Considering when Republicans went to cast their vote and they were told they already voted it was a rigged game.
This election was corrupt, no ID check when going in person to vote, hundreds of mail in ballots found on a drunk driver in Torrance, mail in ballots from people out of state no longer living in California. Even the setup was misleading when choosing candidates.
Another Loser...
He says "we" as if he's been doing something  💥☄
This is a message to everyone out there we live in a controlled environment and it's a waste for us to even vote I can totally tell this is a controlled environment just know that anything that you want you're not going to get look what just happened here stuck with this jackass again.
God bless the best man lost.
We don't need to hear from losers. Why I can't understand why the press keep posting stories about Trump; the biggest loser of all. They have absolutely nothing to say.
I lost faith 8n the mail in ballots cause it makes it easier to cheat
Black guy is wanna be white nationalist. Only in America.
Remember when gav told everyone to mask up and locked them up in their houses, and shortly after that he went mask free out to eat? I do.
Larry the Loser
hell yeah you lost. Why would anyone vote for you LOL
This stunt was just another attempt for the crybaby Republicans to take another bite at the Apple after they lost. Frivolous recall campaigns should not be allowed in the future. And you didn’t force anybody to do anything,  your speech was one big lie just like your life
He asks the crowd 'I have only been a politician for a few weeks, How am I doing?'. Well, HE GOT HIS BUTT KICKED sorely by Gavin Newsom and the people of California. 64% of Californians clearly DO NOT WANT YOU or the GOP, Larry. Stay tuned Larry, because the writing is on the wall for you.
Californians have reaffirmed how much they do not want POC in power in their state
California wants this! Why I left and why most people I know left
Can we sell CA back to Mexico and.give Puerto Rico statehood in their place?
We shut up on the election, YOU F LOST!!!! NOW STFU!!!!
At least this Forest Whittaker Jr. admitted he lost, unlike crybaby Trump lol
Guess now we all know that next 2024 Presidential will be a democrat president again. Dominion strikes again
If he had given this speech in the middle of his campaign, he would have gotten more votes.....probably still not won, but a better showing
The only way to to win anything is to get rid of it so now you're going to tell me that our votes were once more jeopardized I don't understand this what the heck is going on we vote for something and I know California because I live here we don't want newsome what the hell is going on so he's staying anyways complete fraud all of it is fraud against our own wills yeah there's judgment Day for all this all of you will pay corruption.
I bite that Sacramento bee would not be reporting on this if Larry won !
Who was president 2 years ago
LMAO...There were many who didn't think there was a problem with the 2020 election, THEY DO NOW!🤣🤣
A Loser Says What?
Look at all those white supremacists...
It was stolen. He won by a large margin.
"forcing them to clear the forests"....y'all know almost all the forest area in Calif is federal land right?
L
I want to ask you a question why are you a Republican Larry Elder
You mean trump terrorist
California can go to hell for all I care.
Snake oil peddler, he's part of pushing the big lie and destabilizing our elections. He started screaming fraud the day BEFORE the election.
No we’re not
California can suck it
Sour graping
You didn’t force them to pay attention anything because you lost in a landslide
Homelessness? What the hell is the republicans’ plan to fight it??? Schools? What’s the problem? Too much teaching going on?? He’s ridiculous, like every republican.
For all you people who live in California who hate democrats, hate our state, hate our governor, please move and just leave already. Quit complaining and move to a red state. Do something productive instead of whining like your daddy Trump.
Larry, you ain't forcing crap. The people of California looked at you and said "HELL NO!"
No one voted for Newsom. Corrupt America and it’s finest!!
"Stay tuned" baby!
conceding like a little bitch
Helluva recall effort. It was so close.
Hey Cali how do you like those gas prices? thank Newsome and the other corrupt Dems. Lets watch the Audit now!
This means Californians must be happy with everything they got, good for them.
Shut up sellout.
You lost, move on.
Sorry to all the sane Californians that will continue to suffer because of all the insane Californians that passed up the chance to send a message to Newsom and all the other Dems that have destroyed that state.
Lol 😂 smh 🤦‍♂️ stop being a big baby.  Clear our forest? How are u going to do that?
What's wrong with you? Literally 380K votes switched on live TV. Thought you were tougher than this!
The "war" he speaks of...doesn't exist. The pandemic of misinformation, is being noticed by the many, not the few. Any doubt Larry, check election results.
Yup dominion doing its thing again. American elections are not so free.
Congrats to the GOP. Fail Fail Fail
It’s all rigged seriously it’s been going on on both sides for centuries
California: highest prices (by far) in the country, highest homeless population, 2nd highest unemployment rate (behind Nevada), the highest amount of unfunded liabilities in the country, homicides increased 31%, power shortages, water shortages, more residents and businesses leaving than ever before, and people taking huge 💩 on sidewalks   California Democrats: but we have a budget surplus, the largest economy in the country and strict covid restrictions. We like the direction we’re headed in, we’ll keep the same people in charge thank you very much.
I hope he runs again.
They didn’t let republicans vote. Ever since they stole the presidential election they don’t even hide it any more.
WHAT!?!?  No cries of fraud and cheating!  No calls for recount and ballot stuffing.
I don’t understand how Californians love homelessness and corruption…their mentality is beyond me
What's one good thing gavin has done for California
No you're not. This won't get better. Welcome to the end of days.
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
California will vote democrat for many generations. The demographics changed, game over.
*Make Trumptards Mad Again!* 🤡
This is all rigged people wake up I see it and I'm not from there
Black nazi lost. Yeah!
"Hard Work" sounds like another Michelle Obama plagerized speech!
What a surprise, someone who wants a $0.00 minimum wage was rejected in a state with high costs
dawww boo hoo the boomers are upset
Socialism, corruption and freebies continues…
Contrast this to Newsoms speech...  https://youtu.be/Yy8EmTZvkQc
Poor guy got the election stolen from him by the crooked Democrats and there useful idiots lol so pathetic I wonder if all the people that actually signed that petition to remove Newsome actually got to vote I’m sure the Democrats voted for them so pathetic
Why not audit?
The problem is the Republican not stick together and back stepper , look what happen to Trump , they back stepped him  so sad
If you don’t vote for old pasty white Democrats you ain’t Black
Out. Out. Horrible  republicans trumpis. Horrible. Out
“…that they have in fact raised a man.” I wonder if his parents are convinced yet. He is 69 years old.
I’ve heard closet racist Republicans use Larry Elder to excuse their racism. “I’m not racist, I listen to the black community because I listen to Larry Elder” this man represents an excuse to deny racism exists.
Wow he admitted to losing fair and square.  Trump needs to do the right thing now to save our democracy.
its time to leave California
Tried to turn the two blue giants, New York and California red as they did the Supreme Court. First by getting rid of their powerful governors. They want to replace New York governor Cuomo with Rudy Giuliani's son. Governor Cuomo was also a hopeful in 2024.
Is a shame because he could have revived California
It’s so obvious by what I’m hearing from my friends that there was some shady things going on with this election. Many being interviewed said they TRIED to vote only to hear it looked like they already voted!
Larry forgot he was a black man.
God is so good. He lifts up one & seats another down! I just pray Larry Elder gets somewhere & sits down🙏🏽👏🏽🙌🏾
Larry supports compensating former slave owners for the property the government took from them. Google it you can see the video of Larry making this statement and it was not taken out of context that what this man believes. hard to hear that from a white person harder to hear it from a "black" man. This mentality should never be allowed to lead anything. Think about it. What if a white man said that running for office.
Let the trashy democrats have it
AKATA!
California's last chance at turning from evil. Now we just sit back and wait for the accountability, I mean the big quake.
loser
LOL, the attempted Republican power grab fails. “Just say the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R congressmen." Again.
people in California deserve what the get.
Newsome won conservative Orange County and orange elephants can fly you to Catalina Island from LA too.
Hahaha he lost!!! I’m so glad he did
Democrats are all cheaters, try this crap in TEXAS and see what happens. Vote you down!!!!
Everyone  start moving out of CA
"All I need you to do is find me 2,677,236 votes." - Larry Elder 🤔😅😂
Corruption is everywhere. Time to come together and weed it out of our politics.
I’m a working class California resident but idk for how long I feel like I’m being squeezed out of my own state I just can’t afford anything and I actually have a good job I’m 25 and I feel like if I stay here I will never own a home they average 400k in my little town I don’t understand how the price sky rocketed
Enjoy your high taxes, homeless people and dictatorship..  😆
The white hats let him keep his throne even though they know there was rampant cheating and they have the evidence.  Now why do you think they did that?  You leave him in the spotlight for the pain that is coming.  Enter Rose McGowan and the evidence of pedophelia and crimes against humanity!
He seems out of breath and sweaty.....Covid? 🤷‍♀️  This fraud shit is ridiculous. How stupid can you be. There is no fraud. People are just done falling for the GQP bullshit.
How are you forcing anything when you lost in epic proportions?
🤣🤣
You ran a clean race for sure, keep going I know you will make it the next time....is anyone checking the votes.....??? With all the support you had,  hard to believe you didn't win !!!!! so more to follow eh ? There is next time.....and you will succeed ....remember it took ------  how many times ???? At least you lost honest.....and you can go to bed with a good conscience ..... God knows you did it honest too..... !!!!.....I don't know what it is going to take for people to see the real truth !!! The homeless on the street is so sad, so all we can say is God help them, and God Bless you Larry Elder.....Brighter days ahead of you for sure.....
Trump and the Patriots have all the election fraud captured and documented.   The military is key.  Always let the enemy think you are weak when in reality, you are strong.
Hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha , what a joke boy he sounds like trump lapdog
The GOP wouldn’t endorse a single candidate for the recall? Why?
California is a shit show....How do you keep voting Democrat??  Stupid ass voters.
Newsom! Highest taxes and gas prices, Highest DMV fees! Fix the damn highways!
Honestly I dont know what to say. I think it was rigged they said it could take days to count the votes but miraculously they had them all counted by 10pm? It took 2 hours to count all the votes from the most populated state in the country? Theres bs going on.
Californians complain about everything. Then when they have the chance to see real change from someone who actually cares…na
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Elder is a f-ing loser, just listen to the crap that comes out this assholes mouth!
Larry Elder should have won this election. He's a good man and stands up for what he believes in I can't believe California didn't vote for him; are people in California really this stupid to vote for someone who is openly destroying their state Gavin Newsom is literally killing their state, and they want to keep him in office people shame.
Ok. Now go back home and drink some more Orange Julious Ceaser. Bye...
Republican black puppet ,pack your bag and move to Florida or Texas or Kentucky,anywhere but California.
Thanks for wasting hundreds of millions of dollars, taking time away from the Gov to do its job, and causing more division for this country. I feel like recalls are going to be common for almost every elected official in the coming years
Mr. Elder knew he was gonna lose because of Voter Fraud. Not Surprised at All, This just gives the People more Evidence to Hang these Scumbags With.
Larry is racist against his own people so not best candidate for all people!! HE SUCKS!!
This proves democrats are that dumb.
I love the way they had to scare people into voting for gavin instead of Larry
California lost.
That’s how you gracefully lose, unlike trump.
California is lost. How Elder lost to freaking Newsom is just insane. California, you wanted Newsom... you got him and all that comes with that mess of bullshit.
Stop whining, California will not be Red!, no matter how much they “GOP” try, and stop talking about socialism like you all know what the f your talking about. That slogan will not change our minds and Ideas, equality is what matters.
Keep crying Republicunts hahahahhhaha
The libertarian laboratory gaslighting radio host wont be in cali capital doing fox news, rightist rallies as extortion to get policies thru like diaper dump trump did. The zero minimum wage didnt become elders reality. 30 years of elders racebaiting for profit on radio was his example of hard work. The republican party will throw you out for minstrel show no jangled fundraising like candace Owen's, the stooge that said hitler made germany great that cost her a mass jewish voter following. Tokens on payrolls never learn. Many hate you larry for the garbage spewed you are for corp masters who hates the worker masses.
It’s not over Larry. You are still a force for conservatism. 💕
You can't win the war if you get you destroyed in the battle
You have to have a flu shot or join the army. Im asking.
Looks like the Dems back to cheating again
Yeppppp..i voted n doubt it will be cohnted...until voter id becomes a law, election is coming a banana republic.
He probably didn't realize how many racist people were in California.  REALLY an  egg and a gorilla mask.
*This fool is a boondocks character* 😂
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. I am sure Larry is a good man.
Well I guess the democrats brought out their dominion voting machines again .
And here comes the Big Lie parrots crawling out from under their rocks. We live in a democracy, people loose.
I hope Cali burns in hell. They don't deserve Larry Elder, can't wait to see what kind of punishment they'll have with newsom for trying to recall him. lol
One more thing you are SOS Stuck on stupit
God Bless Larry Elder. God sees all, Don't back down.
Buhbye Larry...Please try again! ;)
In the words of Ace Ventura  " La hoo zer "  😅😂🤣
Glad to see the Black Trump lost.   Such an embarrassment.  MLK would laugh in your face boy.
Time for the State of Jefferson
Just another fake election, hell they have had so much practice and with all the right people in all the right places along with the fake news. We really need to take our country back and quit letting this continue.
Everytime the wicked right gets out voted they can't believe it in there  trumploving CT minds .
Wow ! What an awesome speech ! God bless you sir.
It's pretty fukken funny when Republicans CRY "Voter fraud"...but ONLY when  they LOSE!
Another stolen election, whoops dont let me say that the radical left will label me a racist and fascist
With Larry out of the way, Gavin can go full dictator now
California's get what they deserve it turned from hay remove a shit governor to media lies of oh they trying to put a republican in you do knkw the second qustion was who do you want in office you could have just left it blank
This so called man cried and whined about cheating that didn't happen.  He talks a big game, but he is a little person in a party of little people.  And by the way, what's this about complaining about people born with money but when it comes to Trump, no problem?
Elder said it forces them to do what they should have done 2 years ago. Does he think we are stupid. Biden just took office this year and his budget is set for next year. Republicans controlled the Senate up until this last election and now it is 50-50. So with Elder's logic, the things he is talking about should have been taken care of, should have been handled by Trump and the Republican controlled Senate 2 years ago. So this tells me that Trump and the GOP didn't care about the issues that needed to be addressed for the American people. Now it's up to the Democrats to take care of what Americans need but it will come with a budget increase and tax increase. Looks like the largest tax cuts in history did not pay for themselves and we are now going to pay for it. Hope Republicans that voted for Trump are paying close attention to these words. Also, it turns out that 15 cases of the corona virus did not go down to almost zero and the virus did not disappear in April of 2020, as Trump stated on national TV.
Bahahahaha
Best shit ever...now let that bitch burn when the riots start...that state supports 75% of starbucks annual revenue...the best version of a man in California are the bro's at the track days...the rest are pumpkin spice drinking internet gangsters
How racist to choose the white man over the black man. (Sarcasm because some can’t comprehend that)
so apparently the DS still has ways to change votes. How much longer do we have to suffer with them?
Newsom isn't a very good governor in my opinion but I'd rather deal with him than some crazy Covid loving anti-vaxx Trump worshipper.
I was not surprised, I expected this like I expected Biden to win. Evil loves evil .
L O S E R
Gavin Newsom wasn't born on third base. Although I recognize white privilege, he had a tough childhood and his family struggled financially. As your group likes to say, "he pulled himself up by his bootstraps". He has also figured out how to become a success with a major learning disability. I find him to be a great role model for kids with dyslexia.
Larry got screwed
With a ton of conservatives turned away saying they voted already & all the other stuff that they did with Trump voters, did you really think they were going to let Elder win?!?!!
So close...NOT! 😆
Republicans....the scumbags who cried wolf at it again!  LMAO!
Here’s the cold, hard truth: Even though Elder lost (according to what the public is allowed to know), the Deep State has been thoroughly shaken. The Deep State’s power stems from only two things— the people’s ignorance and the people’s willingness to help out in destroying themselves. Both of those things took a serious blow in every event leading up to the recall. Newsom and the CCP Deep State crew did everything they could to prevent California flipping, and we got literally within inches of beating them. The big new target the people should focus their attacks on is the news. That’s the main weapon the Deep State uses to maintain ignorance and compliance. Once that weapon is disabled, the Deep State’s lifespan will shorten from decades to about a week.
Just look at the name "Dominion"  that's all you need to know
Gavin my friend, I told you that Dominion will deliver...so now, just give California what it’s deserving !
Elder had good foundational points (he got my vote) but he was too far Right field on a lot of supplemental issues including not believing in minimum wages & women's reproductive rights. That is ultimately what lost him a ton of voters
No way he lost there is no way, open borders folks how can they call this a legitimate election when so many people that went to the polls found out their ballots were already cast I guarantee you they counted those false ballots
Shut up why didn’t the republicans do all of this when they had total control. Please sit down
The Democrat party has not been nearly as hijacked by "the squad" as the Republican Party has by that "orange wad." Many moderate people are holding their nose and voting for the Democrat.
Anther fake and fraudulent election
I would encourage all California Republicans to move to nearby Arizona, Texas, Nevada, Colorado. Or even venture down to North Carolina, Georgia, or Florida. Last nights vote clearly showed you have no home in California. Your rights and values will never be respected in that Marxist hellhole.
The other guy ruin California , let’s vote for him so he can keep messing things up
Californians had a chance to make it right.  They effed up.  They are ideologically brainwashed devoid of any kind of rational thinking.  I don't give two hoots or a tinkers damn what happens to California or the people who live there.  Let it burn because they won't harvest old timber, let it dry out,because they dump fresh water into the ocean over some  fish, let  all private businesses close down and leave because they refuse to arrest and prosecute thrives.  I DONT CARE. 😶
🙏🏽💭⏱
Glad to see taxs dollars paid sleepy  an joker go help clown Newson
Republicans are such sore losers, the real snowflakes! Hahahahaha GAVIN NEWSON IS STILL YOUR GOVERNOR! You dumb asses wasted over $200 million on this recall bs and still got your asses handed to youse!
Read my lips….
The hilarious Republicans trying to screw California like they screwed up all they states they governed.
Just another trumpublican liar
Looooser!!! Just like Trump!!!
I like Larry and wanted him to win but he is delusional if he thinks that that Newsom and the demoncrats will take this in any other way then as a victory of their administration   and a green light to go ahead with  their disastrous policies. Their arrogance knows no bounds.
He didn't lose. He was robbed.
Mark Zuckerberg admitted facebok is left winged. So they are biased against certain users on facebook. They are acting just what the whined about republicans are doing. Facebook doesn't actually ban people who actually post hate speech. Which is what they mostly whine about. They put 30-day bans on people who post facts and truth.  They are laws even private companies have to obey. Facebook isn't obeying them like how they're discriminating against their white users.
Californians voted Trump out because “Covid mismanagement.” CA ranks worst in Covid deaths and infections. They don’t blame newsom.
U didn’t work hard enough elder..keep crying like trump..
Elder 🏆WON.  JUST LIKE TRUMP DID. 👍 SIR,  after the evil 😈Dominion  machines are  ILEGAL Newsome will only be  new at  GITMO.   you can bet that TRUMP  will be back soon and he will remove 😉 The nasty machines FOREVER.   HALLELUJAH JESUS CHRIST WINS 🏆🙏 !!
Democrats I have seen them cheat before2020
Damn u got smoked. Sorry dude blue state ?  But keep up the hate ? U can't still. Bleed your base.
Larry Elder speaks after Newson CHEATED AGAIN..........WE GOT YOU........
weak republicans cry cry your tears are nothing
Trump's loser clone
This election was stolen just like 2020 people were turned away from the ballot saying they had already voted. Nothing has changed the Republicans will be rolled over in 2022
Nuts
I can't believe with all the hoops Cali's had to jump thru to get Newsome recalled, that it didn't take place!!!!
Insane speech. I never thought he was a puppet til now.
Valiant effort against the forces of evil, but you can't defeat someone with the system on their side. "Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything."
Repeat 2020 election, full of fraud.
I say- organize another Recall Newsom campaign and get those signatures again and again and again…..until he’s out. NOBODY SHOULD QUIT AFTER 1 FAILED ATTEMPT. liberals have never let up since 1960’s….while the rest of us just let it happen. FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM
Look on the bright side. California will continue to be the butt end of jokes for the foreseeable future
Thank you California for sending another extremist home.
Very Good!..
I'm not a Newsom supporter. But California is 1/50 states in the US. If you don't like it here, no one's telling you that you need to live here.
Good job California, you voted against white supremacy by voting against a black man.
OH STFU and go away....FAR AWAY, LOSER!!!!! 🙄🤣
You Didnt Lose Elder
How the heck are you going to win the war? You lost dude. California would rather burn than turn.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In my prayers.  Keep the faith Cali's we sure do know who wins in the end❣🙌✝️🙌
Totally rigged.  the election rigging department is right down the street from me.  Provisional ballots were used big time in this BS "Election"
lol What a  joke. He's fake news. Wasted  everyone's time  with BS. False recall election that shouldn't have happened anyway. A waste of taxpayer's money forcing a recall for no  good reason .
Yes please run again as.nothing would be better than beating the hell out of you again. You lost by landslide this time you will lose even worse the next time. You are a poor excuse  of a human being.
Elder didn't lose anymore than Trump lost..
Bye Larry Elder
How EVER did people in California not want him as a Governor?    lol
What a tremendous wee of taxpayer's money this election was. If Democrats had done this Republicans would be going crazy complaining about the stupidity. CA needs to change the recall requirements so these clowns can't disrupt government and waste money.
No more clown , ignorant fool should hold office
Dems cheated again!  Hundreds of fake ballots were found, along with voters that were told thy already voted!  And that's all they FOUND!  Imagine what was not found!!!
Alabama...Georgia... Texas...Now California...  Republicons everywhere are quickly learning that a Trump endorsement is poison at the polls.
Stop the Steal lol
The fact that Newsom did not resign with all the Hate America expressed towards the prick shows how LITTLE he cares for the people🤮
Just like any 3rd world country...Elections in America are 500% rigged...UNITED STATES OF TERRORISM.
The GOP deserves to get dominated the way Larry did when all you give us is radio talk show hosts and reality tv stars. Larry had absolutely no substance or experience, but wanted to be the leader of the 5th largest economy in the world. Is anyone really shocked by the outcome?
Lol. California is a failed state.
Praying for the few good people left in commiefornia to move out! 🙏🙏
Larry did not lose this election he did not
we all knew there was no way that Pelosi would allow her nephew be recalled....
White supremacists keep in power by racists and commies..
Elder can run for governor in Florida or any office. Florida has Florida man and Trump also Desantis, Scott and Rubio. Move to the  villages in Florida.  Where he can even swap  wives. Florida man
There is no war.  You did not fight for anyone but yourself. We need fire hoses not hot air.
They left only knows hate and mocking.  I mean they flooded the area with people that do nothing but lie and intimidate people into submission or build up an idea to watch people fall flat. They dont care about actual people. This proves it
People it's California live with it or move out
LOSER.. trumptard LOSER 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
They don't give a shit, Newsome is gonna go back to getting blown by big tech and the teachers union. Conservatives don't use their mouth to climb.
Your parents should be proud
No. you won’t win the war. Your selfish lies win you nothing but empty selfishness
the junkies must be so happy!! they can continue to poop in stores uninterrupted
As  a republican i hate living in california not cause of a singular party or person but becasue california as a whole is a shithole of idiots and ignorance and NOBODY CAN FUCKING DRIVE.I for one cant wait to leave before gavin dumbass tries to tax me 10 years for leaving cali
Take a good look at the mess that used to be California, people. This is what happens when "Liberalism" is allowed to spread unchecked...everyone suffers, except the ruling class!
I really wonder how can he stomach being the lapdog of a party that is fueled by white supremacists.
What a shame.
What a great guy
Trey Gowdy exposed the giant scandal that just exploded in Nancy Pelosi’s hometown  Democrats really don’t want Americans to know about this story.  But that’s no longer possible.  And it is all because Trey Gowdy exposed the giant scandal that just exploded in Nancy Pelosi’s hometown.   On his Sunday night Fox News show former South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy informed viewers of outrageous programs in New York and San Francisco to pay criminals not to shoot people.  San Francisco is running a pilot program paying ten high-risk criminals $300 per month not to shoot anyone.  New York is paying violent criminals $1,000 a month to refrain from gun violence.  Gowdy called these programs “extortion” and claimed he could not believe liberals now want to pay criminals while advocating for defunding the police.   “I just never thought government or any other noncriminal enterprise would actually encourage this kind of shakedown or extortion,” Gowdy stated.  “Think about where we are as a country right now. Some progressives are advocating for cutting funding for the cops but paying criminals so they will stop at least until the check clears being criminals.”  “Let that sink in for a second. Really think about that,” Gowdy added. “Some progressives want to stop paying cops but start paying criminals. And these are the same folks who tell us we need more social workers and more psychologists because we all know how great social workers are at processing crime scenes and collecting DNA samples.”      Democrats being soft on crime is one reason Joe Biden’s poll numbers began to slide this summer.  The last thing Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer want as the calendar turns towards 2022 is media stories focusing on crime and the left’s lack of support for police officers.  But kooky leftwing officials in New York and San Francisco are making sure that crime will be at the forefront of the discussion with crazy policies to pay violent criminals not to shoot people.  Renewed Right will keep you up-to-date on any new developments in this ongoing story.  Related
Look, a black Trump.
California got what they deserved.
Remember this California, you wanted this in a higher percentage. I mean you actually wanted this.
If your Californian and you want to fight this left administration, you have to find a new home. We need to be taking actions that get their attention and show them we will not stand for their wrong doing ways, if we don’t, we may very well loose our freedom.
He said he would end homelessness, but has yet to say how. He do understand that building low income housing is not going to end that. How please tell are they going to be able to pay rent, light bill,water bill, buy food? You know the necessities everyone needs in order to live..... Oh guess he never gave that a thought.
I live in California and they can keep voting for democrats all they want. I love seeing this shit hole burn to the ground. Can’t wait to leave!
Goodbye California, this was the last chance at redemption. May the fires of hell swallow this state.
They should stop calling themselves the Republican Party. The GOP is dead and buried. RIP GOP Some possible names: Pro-Death Party (PDP); Pro-Virus Party (PVP); Party of Lies (PoL); Party of Trump (PoT); Anti-Democracy Party (ADP); Anti-American Party (AAP); Anti-Life Party (ALP); Anti-Reality Party (ARP); Anti-Science Party (ASP); Anti-Women Party (AWP); American Fascist Party (AFP); Hooray For Me and F*ck Everyone Else Party (HFMFEEP).
They ain't listening. They won. Winners don't have to listen, they just rule.
Racist Democrats kept him from winning  Democrats are a criminal organization.
I respect that he lost grasfuly and brought attention to matter's that are important to many Americans. Hopefully the new governor will pay attention and resolve at least some of the issues .
Are they (Trumptrash) going to ransack the state capitol now?
He just knows there are more homeless people in California so he decided to lean on them for 🗳. But they know the truth.
The people have spoken. Adolf Newsome is not wanted. Communism is not welcome here. We destroy nazis like Adolf Newsome and his communist democrat party. Get off your asses people
Another politician.
The GOP once again shoots it’s self in the foot.
Republicans don't believe in unity and Martin Luther King Jr would be rolling in his grave having larry elder say his name
Any moron who still supports trump or his ideas needs to be booted off this planet.
Who cares . Go back to ur radio show
Hey Steven,  Django is coming for you.
Should Mr. Elder decide to run again I will financially support him-and I don't even live in California.
Whatta turd on society
California voluntarily embraced tyranny. They deserve what they get.
Rigged Election and democrats will keep doing till you burn there butts on it make an audit and make them prove he won .
I live in Oakland. I don't know the answer but it is clear California is not on the right path. I didn't like Trump, but I also don't like Newsom. I wish there was a third party for reasonable people to meet. People who believe in freedom but also acknowledge the reality that not everything can be blamed on nebulous concepts of "white supremacy" and "climate change". Newsom is a child. He thinks like a child. He is not part of the people. He is an elitist who believes that the middle and lower classes can be manipulated by slick messaging. Anyways, I don't want to leave California, but I think our family may.
Elder is a good man. He will be here for Americans for a long time to come. All Americans.
"Elections" are nothing but window dressing.
This sounds like he is getting the people to accept the fraud vote outcome. I stead of fighting for truth and declaring a honest voting system!!!! Gavin did not win!!!!!!! All liars will not inherit the kingdom of heaven
Hey Steven,  Django is coming for you.
Sorry Larry they are laughing out loud at the Weak Republican Party
Larry keep up the good fight, it's worth it.  Next time you'll get em.
Whew! CA, and the country, dodged a bullet. We don’t need another TX or FL. It’s sad to see conservatives and White supremacists acting out their fears on such a large scale. They’ve literally come out of the woods, traded the white hoods for suits and declared war on their own country. It’s starting to feel a little too 1860-ish around here.
You lost it is what it is 😭🤣
Just gonna take a wild guess, did they use Dominion Machines?
I knew he couldn’t beat dominion- it does us no good to vote!
Another totally fair, totally legitimate election.
I mean it was obvious he was going to lose. He was failing in the polls. A majority of California is Democrat. Republicans have no power in California and haven't for more than a decade. His platform was toxic and inviting morons like Rose McGowan who lives in MEXICO was useless.
A drug dealer had missing ballots in his car when police pulled him over..the news only reported on it once lol so corrupt!
CALIFORNIA IS DOOMED
I think alot more people were open to dumping Nuesome. BUT there were too many examples of bad republican governors that tarnished Elder. Elder was also his own worse enemy with his past statements.
Larry Elder didn't lose the recall election,  California did
Thank the Republican Party for allowing another stolen election  they knew months ago how this was going to go  Print your own ballots mail in voting , drop boxes  no ID required  envelopes with windows to see who the vote is fore  fold the ballots thru the challengers name so the machines will reject it felon with thousands of Newsome ballots caught by police  this was 2020 all over again the Republicans are so weak expect the same in 2022 midterms
❤️
According to liberal logic, everyone who criticized this man is a racist because he’s black :)
If this guy would have won he would've done nothing for the homeless. Just like all the other states with homeless issues. Politition bs everytime one thinks they can do better.
Get this blob fish tf off the air already, his 15 minutes are over!
THE SAME LOUDMOUTH ISAW & HEARD SAY=  "SLAVE OWNERS MAY DESERVE REPARATIONS BECAUSE THEIR PROPERTY WAS TAKEN FROM THEM>>"   I KID U NOT!!   HE IS TOTAL PHONY INCOMPETENT.  GO  FIND A DEEP HOLE & CRAWL IN!!!!
Sore Looser, we dont divide, 😅😅😅tell that to Trump pendejo.
Move to Texas clown.
That’s the only way, forcing them, cause they have no idea on how do it on their own, facts.   It’s sad to see many people liking to be in the same precaurious  situation, after a failure of their government, they decided to keep him.  Elder is the man!
White privilege  is keeping Newsome in power.
There was ZERO CHANCE this second coming of Marjorie Taylor Green was going to win in the bluest of blue states.
Larry Elder is a fine man - California doesn't deserve him - R.I.P. Callie!!!
Wamp wamp
California's simply want socialism.  Can we just give it back to Mexico and be done with it
Back to Candieland for Stephen.
Elder go home and look for a job! Of course you are loser like 45
The idiots in this comment section make me realize just how doomed California is. Congrats morons, you have played yourselves for the umpteenth time.
California really love the Democrats.
He sounds like a Democrat: caring about issues such as forests, schools , environment, health.  When did the GOP care about these issues unless it was to push richman white supremacy.
A silly guy who said  “The minimum wage should be ZERO” thought that people with common sense were going to vote YES for him. All I can tell him is to get his ASS back to the radio station and keep grinding
This is simply a donation machine.
Larry if you came to my state, I’d vote for you. But you’re not getting me to move there.
You did not loose sir! It was rigged! Soon you will be the governor because you really one!
Stop your bs stop claiming fraud every time a republican don’t win, after trumps ineptitude republicans winning  in a fare free election is next to none that’s why republicans are conducting voting oppression. Texas, Georgia, Florida and many more strong holes trying to follow. Shame on you 🐑!
The left followers are committing suicide with their decisions and they aren’t suicidal, they’re just not seeing clearly.
Imagine if Elder became the governor, that motor mouth of his would drive me crazy. He thinks he's going to be another Martin Luther King. The reason we have too many homeless because thousand people move here from other states to join other homeless.
hilarious inflated sense of his own importance
Don't give up..keep up the good fight mr. Elder
Who is Larry Elder? I don’t recall 🤣
Controlled opposition equals no competition
All these racist in California don't want a Black Man as Governor.
U started the battle and lost the war u are only a mini me cult trumpet and Cali didn’t need a trump and u lost because u are a liar u started that rigged bull this is why we have issues now like Jan 6 please go sit down somewhere
Cali is a nice place to visit, but not a nice place to live
Newsome didn't have much supporters
Why would I vote for a guy who thinks slave owners deserve reparations?
We need to recount the ballots
How can you lose because lots of ballots stills sitting in the post office today?
Another GOP grifter and con man wasting nearly $300 million of CA tax payer money, he must be proud
Are Ca.voters crazy?Its no wonder the State has so many problems.They deserve the radical Left agenda
Just imagine the energy this wind bag would create if he only stood in front of a wind mill!
He did not accomplish anything notable.
radio host who tell bullshit.
Hard work, that’s right Larry. All your hard work has elevated you to the ranks of America’s greatest losers.   Robert E Lee. Donald J Trump  Larry Elder Keep up the good work, democrats support you running as an (R).
Larry .. Until you are ready to come to grips with the fact that you lost BEFORE the election .. and that it had already been decided by the power elite..  you are just going to keep talking until you drop..  and NOTHING will ever get done. FIX ELECTION INTEGRITY FIRST - BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE.
Larry Elder has to watch out for Gavin Newsom taking autocratic measure to put him in jail as a tool of vengeance for running the recall campaign.
He should teach Trump how to not be a sore loser and accept defeat like a man.
I never thought Newsome would be recalled.  Isn't he Pelosi's nephew?
So California rejected Larry Elder. Weird that a large, racially diverse state doesn’t want to be led by a guy who thinks George Zimmerman is a hero, Stephen Miller should be president, slaveowners deserved reparations, COVID should proliferate and the minimum wage should be $0.
Let those voters stew in their own shlt if that’s what they want...
Democrats  suck. They elect the same people over and over, then cry for change, lol, they are Idiots, but don't anyone tell them that,  they believe the are the educated party.
Too bad so sad u lost 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Dominion wouldn't allow Pelosi's nephew to lose .....hahahaba
I’ve never seen a purple suit Wherever would you buy one But I can tell you anyhow I’d rather die than try one.
Another GOP loser. The GOP needs to change or they will never win any election. Electing basic morons as candidates every time will not help.
Oh, now the election wasn’t rigged? 🙄
The voters united and said no to you home slice.
They cheated slot of people didn't like him
RIP CALIFORNIA
parlo con Joe baiden lui detto ispostare tua pro memoria io Cosa devo fare
I hope they have shit in all their streets and beach boardwalks in the future.
Republicans don’t believe in nothing he saying, look at their actions now
Democrats  suck. They elect the same people over and over, then cry for change, lol, they are Idiots, but don't anyone tell them that,  they believe the are the educated party.
TELL ME MORE ! !
"Look in the mirror and ask yourself what you could have done to affect the outcome".  Larry, looking in the mirror: "I'll say the election was rigged".   👍😉😂
I see Larry Elder is spewing worthless nothing from his mouth as usual. You lost because no one wants you or believe anything you say.
religion is just a cult without any facts, religion separate people.
This is rigged
Do you liberal DUMB PHUCKS find it odd that only 3 Families have been in charge of California the past 80 years... go ahead and fact check it..
should not have conceded. This will change nothing. If anything the communists will be even worse.
Bye Felicia 👋 ✌️
He must have a brother
Another fortified election.

Now recall DeSantis in Florida!
🤔🤔🤔
The truth is California was between a rock and a hard place. Neither one of these candidates were good candidates and now California gets to suffer even further under Newsom. Terrible.
What a goon, talking " unite" minorities to the white supremacists.
For all the people who voted for Newsome, you have no right to complain about ANYTHING! Newsome stands for Homelessness, high taxes, communism, deceit,  dictatorship, mockery and so many other negative things. Good Luck California!
I was hopeful.  It seems that Larry Elder was the Last Best Hope for California.
God bless you Larry  Elder. Keep  fighting for your state.
GOP whiners need to shut up.
Trump still winning elections...for Democrats.
Probably rigged that election too.
Great, election fraud? How many times can you can make the excuse without showing proof!
At this point in time….with all of the cheating and nefarious acts that happened during the voting(?) process, that another election was just STOLEN from the Californian people by the democRat party crime syndicate?
It made zero sense anyway.  Republicans used another foolish person to do their dirt.  Republicans have never cared about any of those years and it is clearly on record how they vote and what policies they support.  Social service has NEVER been a concern of the Republican Party.  Go away
Looks like he WON the popular YouTube VOTE! Interesting how that didn't translate to California....Makes you go....Hmmmmmm...What's up with that.....
the democrates want to solve problems republicans create problems that don`t exist.
Larry elder should leave California he would do better in another state. Sorry you lost.
BYE!!! LARRY!!! Good Riddance!!!
Buck dancing pos!!
I bet they pulled of a Dominion steal again.
California people must be so proud of their App that finds human sh*t in the streets so you can avoid it only in Cali...
I knew he wasn't going to win but damn I was hoping he did.
The recall election was a waste. Being against Newsom isn't enough incentive to get people to vote. You have to offer a great alternative and Larry Elder is not that.
Why do y'all always bring up Martin Luther king!?
You're doing bad... according to your policies and conspiracy theories. That's why you lost. Unity under the republican party is ppl awful. I hope your radio show goes under
Stolen again!
California had a second chance... they blew it.
Typcial racist democrats!!
how you doing well you lost.
As a born and raised CA native taxpayer I want a forensic audit of the California election system.  The recall election AND the presidential election in 2020.
LOSERS!! GQP is the cult of trump and California said, “ NO”! Wasted 250+ million dollars on what? Lame power grab🙄
Hey, you a holes in Cali deserve what you get. I left that state years ago because of this crap. You morons love this governor? Good, you deserve what you all get out there in Cali.
It must be fraud 😂
Your just as stupid as trump! You suck as a politician, you should be honest not start out as a liar.
go away
Nobody cares what he has to say, period.
...My guess is all your voting machines were rigged...All the HollyWeird LibTARDs having TDS about the recall...Sounds all fixed in CA.....If wasn't on the East coast, I'd vote for Elder!
We need this man in Texas. California may not recognize the gem they have, but we do. Let us have him.
THE SEXY GIRL ARE  XGIRLS.UNO      THREE IN ONE  YOUTUBE: THIS IS FINE.  SOMEONE: SAYS ''HECK''.  YOUTUBE: BE GONE  Life's story is a short journey so have fun before sleeping forever  #Чо #эт #делает #на #2 #месте #в #тренде #однако #я #люблю #таких #рыбаков .#垃圾.
Please run against Newsom. There's no way Newsom will change course after the recall failed.  Love what you're standing for Larry!
Gavin was so popular that they needed a recall vote.
they raised a trump junkie.
all the morons who hate Trump who was helping this country and praise the dems who are hurting us
The election is over, now it's time to work together for the betterment of the state. Stop the foolishness,  all are to blame in some way for the eroding of our states and country.
He's just so uppity!
It was a republican by the name of Ronnie Reagan who started this tidal wave of homelessness.  He began closing mental hospitals to save money. He put many mental patients on the street. He had promised them some type of housing and out patient care.  They got nothing.  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. No assistance for you. That's the republican meme. If you are poor well then go F××k yourself. Rub in your chest and die. That's the  Republican way. We want more taxes but not from the super wealthy.  Pay up poor people.  😢.  Yessiree the Republicans are just fine compassionate people. You just gotta love them. Trumps new slogan. MAWA.  Make America white again.  What a slug.
Did they already count all the drop-off ballots and mail-in ballots?  It seems that California calls the elections before mail-in and drop-off ballots are counted.  Why is that?
Surprise. Surprise. Elections are rigged. Surprise.
You had one chance California, so don't come begging later!!
California SUCKS
A politician who says there is a "war" between fellow countrymen?  Yeah Republicans are funny like that.
It’s nice watchin all these republicans taking L’s 😂😂
For all the money wasted on campaigning that could have built shelters and fed the homeless.
How can I believe there is a God when evil always wins?! I’m sick of it!!!
California SUCKS
He just named off everything Republicans do not care about !!
Oh well, California had a good chance to get out of the mess that is California. Good man, wish he was a governor somewhere
Im from New York and this saddens me.
Ok fine so let CA wallow in the cesspool's it is.  Now, more businesses will be leaving than ever
There is nothing “conservative “ about the modern RepubliKKKant party.
Larry Elder did not lose the election. He won since he outperformed all the other candidates. The people of California were the ones who lost since they were unable to recall their tyrant of a governor.
Margin of error must be at about 35/45% if you include fraud
With Trump's endorsement Elder with his VP "Grennell" are on their way to the White House. This loss CLEARS the way for Elder to take DOWN treason Milley et al
They only voted against elder because he's black
LMFAO! That list Elder says they are forcing us to pay attention to are exactly the things Republicans have refused to work on or  even acknowledge exist. Typical right wing fuckery.
"Losing" in fingerquotes.  The democratic election fraud system remains STRONG ladies and gentlemen.
We aren't making them do shit lol civilians don't have power when it comes to politicians
Potatohead looking ish
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Newsom, the $limeball that won, Elder, the $limeball that lost.
Only Cure For California Is A 10.2 Mega Quake At Rush Hour On A Friday!
$276,000,000 up in smoke for this GQP nonsense
God will not bless us while we keep killing babies. Our country has been seduced into worshiping Moloch by calling it "pro choice". Until we repent and turn from our wicked ways, only then will God hear us. "if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land." 2 Chronicles 7:14
You're a big joke
Elder abuse going on in the white house and now in CA.
"A man" doesn't imply the system is rigged without concrete evidence he can produced at a moments notice upon demand.... only a child does that.
It’s over for California and US, the snakes completely took over people’s minds.
We just forced your Ridiculous ASS OUT of CA!
That Trump [___] didn’t work!! 😂 Larry felt for it!! 😄
....unhappy people think that everyone is unhappy about the mask and vaccines, and all that........and make a lot of noise....  The truth is that the majority are not against the mask mandate or the vaccines... and that is that.
democrats are killing our country
The deep state cheated with mail in ballots again
Time will tell how legitimate this election really was. Guess who was watching?
Lmao 😆
We don't divide by race... We don't divide by gender.. We don't divide by sexual orientation  We don't divide by ethnicity We don't divide by religion We Unite.  That's all Trump republicans are doing right now! Voting restrictions (Texas) A women's right to decide what she does with her body (republicans, and a republican majority supreme court) I could do on an on, but Larry is sipping all the trump rhetoric. Even tried to plant seeds that the recall was rigged, until you got that ass drove in dirt overwhelming.  I'm not saying Newsom is the best, but when you look at the alternative it was not close.    And for the doubters about Cali, when Gov Gray Davis a democrat was screwing up and got recalled we replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger a republican we are equal opportunity even with our problems.
See ya Chumplican
So this guy is using the Bernie sanders strategy of just running in order to bring political issues to the voters attention? Lol socialist
Gotta leave commiefornia asap. Wouldn't be surprised if many move out soon.
Almost $300 million dollars for this recall election.    What a waste of our money.   We should have just waited until next year.
Yay the racist lost!
Good . Now he can continue  to finally destroy Cali.  They deserve it  . But please  libs stay in Cali. Don't  come to our states with your leftist  policies  and try to destroy  them also . Stay in your garbage  . PLEASE  !!!
CHALLENGE THE VOTES???!!!!!!
If you win be gracious and humble.  If you lose be gracious in defeat. Only babies cry when everything doesn't work out for them.
LOL.....Elder you are just a bad choice of competition.....lost by like 30 friggen points.
Well Larry,if I lived in California YO WULD HAVE MY VOTE, THATS FOR SURE,!  GOD BLESS YOU!
Anyone else amazed at all the comments from Republicans thinking they aren't stupid
Nice try Clayton Bigsby 😂😂😂
Newsom is a pile of crap
Just stay loyal to your lovely loyal one party Democratic state in CA and don’t leave to another state if you voted no to this recall and complain about the high gas prices, high taxes, and high cost of leaving eating up most of your paycheck for the middle class because you supported these policies.🤣
I guess are votes don’t count no more liberals and Democrats got the cheating machines
They did it again!!2020 all over again!!
Are y’all really surprised that a Democrat won in a overwhelmingly Democrat state? So every time a Republican loses it was stolen?
YEAH BOI ! KEEPING CALIFORNIA A 💩 SHITHOLE 💩 👍👍👍👍👍
Lol
No surprise here…the corrupt democrats had the fix in from the beginning 🤬🤬. Californians deserve what they get for not voting the corrupt Newsom and his cronies out of office…enjoy the mess that is now California 🤮🤮
Sunk like the rock you're. If God/god is just why would he want to have a spokesman like you.
Sorry Larry, too bad for California !! Socialists want Socialism even though they don’t know how bad it will get when NOBODY is working in that state.
Mr Elder,sorry that you lost,California must not be ready for a black Governor, after I saw the utter racist attack a week ago, they still want to ruin their state further and keep the rich white boy,and Iwill day this for the ones complain later and want to escape, your not welcome in my state,I live in a state where everyone from blue states are going to,yes California, where dreams die.
Loser
Or maybe you should be having this Governor recall in Texas if you want to take care of problems, for better yet maybe Florida.
Only potato heads would think that Newsome is the best choice to fix the problems, that he himself helped create. 😆
They raised an idiot!
With all the feces on the street and all the wildfires caused by policies from idiots it's fun to watch. It's like you have to be air dropped into the nice places because you will get literally sick if you drive thru any of the other. Lol looking forward to season 7 of lockdowns and rolling blackouts.
I believe that the people of California lost....
I don’t know why  evil always win .. so sad
You notice brother they didn't & wasn't 👏 👏 👏 👏 clipping when you spoke about MLK SO STUPID 🥸
OH SHUTUP AND GO BACK TO SLEEP, . GUESS YOU DIDN'T WORK HARD ENOUGH  CAUSE YOU LOST!!! LOSER
Elder will do nothing about climate change a good reason he lost.
The whole idea of today's Republicans spouting the ancient truisms and adages of their Protestant-Ethic-inspired parents goes beyond laughable into the farcical.
He lost but he wants all the credit
Why not try another recall you anti-democratic losers? When you lose, grow up and accept it. You turds did nothing but waste money that could have gone to the "homeless" that you suddenly care so much about. You hypocrites and liars will keep losing.
You trust the vote. Come on guys!
Ummm if anything California is the  the example state that you do not want to become I mean let's be realistic they have horrible policies put in place. The governor doesn't know what he's doing. You want a good example how you can Thrive and keep going look at us Texas. And before any leftist trys coming for me im a person of color and it is racist to attack me. Im Hispanic as well
Would never live in California…  You folks are brainwashed and indoctrinated beyond all hope…😎
As long as Trumpism is around the GOP will never win!!! USA is better than that!
He'll be working for fox soon
Clayton Bigsby. Only he isn't visually blind.
The result is just proof that once again you can't fix stupid. Seems like the only solution at this point is for every conservative/republican/independent to move out of California and go to another State. At least that way California will have either a lower population or pull liberals from other States and therefore have less impact on the National elections. ie less population less Electoral Votes
Forget building a wall along Mexcian Border...   Need to build a wall along the Cali border... Cut Cali off, save the rest of the country....
Darth Newsom dark lord of the sith foretold this
This election was completely legitimate, Elders first words "We recognize that we lost the battle"
Another STOLEN Election!!!
Californians are racist.
when Democrats win, they obviously cheated When Republicans win it was free and fair election.  the logic of Republicans.
Absolute huge L, Complete waste of taxpayer's money. CA GOP is a joke. Can't win a real election nor this fake one. Sad, really.
Many Red states have the same problems, woe you hypocrites. May these words of your mouth and this meditation of our heart be pleasing in Americans sight.             Speak the truth #45 was frightening to USA & Allies. 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 USA
Good man, he is setting an example to people who cannot accept the cold hard truth. I have no idea what party these guys are in and don't care I vote by common sense.
The real MVP 💯💯💯
Man I can't wait till this s*** hole falls in the ocean come on earthquake
The fool lost. Thank God
Patriots, business , move out  of state let California burn down to the ground! These stupid people are hopeless. Let them feel Gods Wrath. Their our better places to live  for your families. In a safe, crimeless area where your  kids can run in play without falling over homeless body's, and needles, and crap!! Without people burning down your businesses, looting, watching your family members being killed or rape because of crime! The democrats that voted for that governor again are just plain stupid! The democrats there are the most stupid ever! What a bunch of Numb skull!!!
It's a shame good people are not elected in democrat states. One day the people will realize the big mistake they just made.
There should have never been a recall. The election is the election and sore losers want a second chance, but the election is the election.
So much for black equality in kakafofnicate.   Looks like white power is as strong there as anyplace else.   It's was expected.   I'm sure the recall was fixed.  Either that or kakafornicate is just another racist state.
Another fixed vote.
notice how none of them cheered when he brought up MLK lmao
Boooooo!!! You SORE LOSER! You cannot threaten California Democratic voters with your claim to using "the fourth box" to kill them. All your lies were revealed. Get lost!
How are you doing he ask. You suck.!! If you really know who this guy is. And was in the audience. You would telling him. Larry you forgot to put on your white klan hood.
California is a big ass mess under Newsome... and the people who live there like it like that?  Pathetic!
Newsome  needed the BIG guns only cuz he is a looser !
Goes to show you that California really is dumbest state in the country....
This guy is full if BS. The trumpublican cult he belongs to lost the respect its once had when it ceased being the Republican party. They do not care about the environment, homelessness, across the board civil rights, or uniting the Nation. That is why he lost.
He would’ve sucked too, as evidenced by the content in this video.
Ha. Too bad.   MAGA = Many Angry Goofy Assholes.
Can't wait to sit back and watch the dems in California get all the shit they deserve. Say bye bye to what little freedoms you have left, you are now living in a dystopian state.
If you dont make 150 grand a year your a Democrat....these people dont give a crap about people that live under 80 grand a year....see how much taxes amazon pays....all the big companies....00000...now how much did you pay?.. Now say your a Republican
This is why federalism is important.  The types of morons that keep Newsome in power in California shouldn't get to decide how people live in other states.
MAGA clowns 🤡 🤣
The the Golden Shower State asked for it, and here it comes.  Enjoy Dystopia.
People are tired of the lies, the crazy talk, and Rs trying to take away constitutional rights. Go away.
They stole another election. You were defeated by dead people and illegal "votes" . We do not have a democracy anymore.
All lies, such a fucking liar glad you lost
What a coincidence that they found a passed out guy in a car with 300 recall ballots. This was a stolen election.
Go meet Trump.
You can't fix stupid in Cali!!LMAO
California would never elect a tRUMPIST
Say it with me....LOSER
Lmao! No. No you won't.
Republicans are against abortion and against feeding children also
He’s not trumping and saying that he actually won. Thank you Larry Elder, I’m proud to say I voted for you and you have earned my respect as a man and as a person.
He is such a tool.  The only thing you have forced is (1) people didn’t want this recall (2) your failure to win (3) California isnt into playing games with a wanna be trump in black face 0
We need a election ballot count.
"We believe in the vision of Martin Luther King" Hey bud, when MLK was shot he was preaching against economic inequality and standing up for unions. Meanwhile, taxes were already way way way way way further left than anything the furthest left has proposed in the last 40 years. Anyone calling themselves a conservative today is an idiot extremist.
Get out of California while you can.
I'm dissapointed 😔  I can't believe this is out government now. Whats next to see?? It makes me sick the democrats are winning everything they are full of lies and they don't care about we the people. I have no hope in this country anymore. 😔
Elder Is A Looser, Just Like Trump And All His Cronies And Enablers.
Haha. Now I can text my brother and tell him his state still sucks.. Learn to swim see you down in Arizona Bay.
Hi Guys....BACK WHERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR CO HOST......CONGRATS ...FOX ...
The racist, corrupt California Democrats just rigged another election - this time so a black man couldn't become Governor of California.  Good job, racist Democrats.
Rip to California
Go away elder, move to Texas or Florida
I desperately want a better california. Newsom is not the one to do it. We need to take care of the homeless problem and faultering schools. That said, a right wing conspiracy theorist who is a contributor to the Epoch Times is absolutely not the right person to do it either.  Dr. Drew For Governor!
What  a waste.
Liked the speech Larry,but does anyone out there think newsome will wake up and make some changes? I don’t, I think now he’s going to be convinced he can do no wrong and if anything, things will get worse for California. The only people he cares about are the elites, people like his worthless scumbag aunt
He sounds a bit delusional. Elections have consequences. You lost. And the war is a figment of your imagination. There is no war. And if there were you would lose it. Republicans lose because their ideas suck and people don't like them. If you accidentally decide to do something for the people you would get in trouble with the RNC. So get used to losing. Have a nice day.
"L"   - the big L - for both you and your buddy Trump.
Hahahahha well I guess I’ll just keep laughing at the homeless families in Cali just stay out my trash can
It was a good effort. The opposition did a better job at getting out the vote, that’s all.  Has anyone thought that the Democratic Party stuffed the ballot boxes…again?   My dad voted again,  but he has been dead for six years.  Now that is a miracle.
So much for churches and government being separated he thanks a bunch of ministers, because they don't care about the Constitution.. it's fine if churches want to lobby for their guy but they shouldn't get tax exemption, they should pay taxes like all the rest of us do and then they can do what they want... But I do give him a little credit, he didn't claim the vote was fixed... I seriously thought he would do that...
Uncle Larry didn't win nothing! GTFOH!
Man these comments have some small pp energy ngl
Dodged that bullet! Thank god! Bye!
It turns out. Larry elder's was a Sell out and a fraud.
Why would the Government just cheat in the 2020 presidential election,  they were caught but never prosecuted.  So, every election from 2020 forward will be an illusion....
What war is Elder talking about? Next failure of the Republicans? Now you talk about unite? Boy, you’ve got no shame! Cut the BS and go away.
He thought kowtowing to angry white Republicans and crazies was worth selling out to his race, and pissing on the struggles of his accessors. But what he didn't want to factor in is that he is BLACK, he can take a shit on "Critical Race" that I'm sure he couldn't define, buy he's plantation BLACK and despite California's Devon Nunes and Kevin Crazy Quaker Oats Looking McCarthy, California is not ready for a Trumpian BLACK, Republican governor.
There’s a bunch of copium in this comment section.
LARRY, HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED TO BECOME THE GOVERNOR OF MINORITY ?
Like I said they would find away lot of people said they went to vote and told they already voted and people said Larry's name not on ballet I don't live in California but I'm tired of this The Democratic party has destroyed America !!!
Everyone in here bitching about election integrity have nothing else to argue. Do a better job at constructing an actual argument instead of saying “rigged” you whiners.
Everyone new Elder was gonna loose he just a big mouthpiece for the rich powerful and corporations. He a trumpster come on people this a blue state! Always has been! Always will be! Newsom is not perfect but is doing lots of good things for californians
Republicans knew they wouldn't flip california. They just wanted to make all the money they could fundraising for it.
"Lost" the recall election.
California gets the government it deserves.
This black man obviously was shielded by his mother and never got the opportunity to get smacked down by law enforcement. He was lucky..!
Mail in voting. The new Democrat shoe in.
What speaks is that majority of people who voted for newsom are from la or the city and that’s where newsom and messed up the most lives
Two California that voted for Gavin you will be sorry that you did because now he's going to come back with a vengeance to the 40% that didn't vote for him. Need to wake up it's going to come back around to you one day.
THERE ‼️ his way of revenge "meaning" let's start a war⁉️ So people be aware TRUMPS coming back⁉️ it's about to start all over⁉️
Weak
At least he didn't cry "FRAUD!" like many expected. He's a bigger man than Trump.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not a true Trump clone because he accepted defeat (I guess it's difficult even for him to claim fraud for such a colossal loss). Otherwise a complete moron like his orange master.
Good Solid Man.. Lord help Cali...     Most Shocking Story today is the usurpation of Civilian Control over the Military.      MSM says Trump is crazy and backs Milley.. Have they even watched their guy attempt to read a TelePrompTer? Have they even taken a casual glance at what has happened in Af? Supposedly ordered by joe and carried out by Milley?     NK (once again testing ballistic missiles under joe) , Russia, Iran, China (just inked a $400 billion deal with Iran and is presently reverse engineering hi-tech Military Equip left for the Taliban AND is moving into Bagram).. ALL backed off under Trump. Not to mention the Trump Abrahamic Accords in the Mid East bringing peace..     I’m registered unaffiliated- put down the Kool Aid folks and actually engage in research.
What a Liar with God and power on his mind.  Not all is lost Larry, Trump backs up your false face and lies.  California is smart not to give you a second thought.  Yes, we have problems, however it will take all of us to solve them not just you and your evaluation of our very popular Governor of California.  I give you thumbs up for not saying the election  was rigged as it was not.  Thanks.  The people have spoken.
Cry for me
In California is called a WIPE OUT!
Hilarious money laundry.
and the reign of Newsolinni continues......
Lol you lost by more than 50%! Your views was too dangerous just to keep it real !
Larry you admitted you lost?  What about what you said yesterday that if you lost it was voter fraud?  You're a joke tRumpist like the rest of the Clowns.
bye bye
Man watching the death of the Republican Party is almost sad, they really have no idea that they’re done for.
Are. You..people..dumb. In..california..voting..for .NEWSOME. YOU. Will..be. Sorry. How. Sad
All you none character Democrats and Republicans player’s wake up and smell what these politicians are feeding you and it’s not truth that’s for sure so keep on being divided by your leaders only the weak follow !!!!
You lost get the hell out of our hair
California is infested with dems, there was no way he could win.  Losers like to be governed by losers.
Listening to this dude lie through his teeth. Party of unity my ass.
The Republicans care about homelessness------What a Joke .!
King of the kakakakooooons
Well all you libtards can thank Dominion Voting machines !!!! Once again!!! Free and fair elections??? LMAO! They’re agenda is almost complete
God bless Larry Elder, sadly the better man lost this election.  However, Californians are the biggest loser and I don’t care what the Hollywood elite, liberal media or anyone else says.  The Exodus to leave California will accelerate.  Good luck renting a U haul.  They cost 5x to leave Ca compared to arriving.  Don’t believe me?  Go to the U haul site and look at the cost to leave San Francisco to any city in the Midwest, then write that number down.  Then reverse the origin and destination and look at that cost.  Facts don’t lie.
never heard a republiscum care about any of those issues, he must be making money off each one of them in someway.
GREAT JOB LARRY!!!!!.u opened many eyes not living in that state of the true embarrassment to this country that it is...This should be the sign for the real honest, law abiding Americans, the little that are left to RUN FOREST RUN!!!!.Leave it to those America hating lunatics..
How could you NOT vote for Larry!? Makes no sense to me. Either they cheated the election again with the machines OR people are idiots. SMH
DEMOCRATS & BIDEN are attempting to DESTROY AMERICAN BUSINESS & REDUCE US MILITARY by 50%, all with MANDATORY VAX!  WEAKENING AMERICA for CHINA TO INVADE! EVERY WALKING IS RESPONSIBLE!
L COLUMN
I guess it's true, Californians really do want to live in a cesspool. They are going to get just exactly what they deserve.
Oh brother!! What was Elders plan?? Complaining.
Love this man!
Deplorable man with no honor.
Laughing what a fool
You lost bro that's how you are doing
How many signatures did they have to have to get the recall like a million and a half or something like that. But when it came time to vote they didn't get that many the game is rigged. Just like the presidential election how come the media didn't cover the crackheads that had thousands of ballots in his car that were opened how come people were getting turned away at the polling stations because they were told they already voted none of this stuff is being brought up the game is rigged the courts are rigged from state to Federal. All we got is our guns
Hard work wins ? Is that why the Kardashians are gazillionaires by showing off their a$$es ? Having the right connections doesn’t make a difference ?  How much effort did those Powerball lottery winners make ?
Haha. This guy was full of hot Air. All fake words. I'm glad he lost.
Hey at least he didn't cry like a big baby unlike trump....Larry lost by a ton he never had a chance and he never will
Im not fan of newsom but Im glad he won.  Larry is AWEFUL.  He thinks Slave owners are owed money, the min wage should be 0 and so on. During his speech he brings up someone was robbed and the crowd was clapping. He was then forced to change tune after calling them a tough crowd.   Stop being a bunch of low IQ idiots everyone
Get this crap I caught the apartment building manager lying she told me she called my case manager a week ago and I found out from my case manager this morning that is not true my case manager says the apartment building manager did not call her about me needing to clean my apartment so I wonder if she was lying about anything else
This definitely was a set up 💯💯
They rather keep a corrupt white governor, than you Larry, what does that say about you.🤔 they 💩 all on you.
YOU, a fking REPUBLICAN think that YOU are forcing democrats to address homelessness and taking care of the forests? For heaven's sake, you're more delusional than I thought from your nonsense last week.
You enforcing the Democrats to do anything  you  lost your mind go back to your freaking talk show worthless elder
I am glad that he lost...
Looooserrrr!🤣🤣🤣🤣
God Bless you Larry
WITHOUT VOTER ID ANYBODY CAN VOTE 1 TIME OR 500 TIMES  THAT IS WHY NEWSOM WAS NOT RECALLED BECAUSE MAIL IN  BALLOTS IS THE BIGGEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF ELECTIONS AND AUNTIE PELOSI THE MASTERMIND NO DOUBT WAS BEHIND THIS  LIKE SHE WAS BEHIND ILLEGITIMATE BIDEN. ALSO WITH THE HELP OF FAKE NEWS TO BELIEVE THE FAKE REALITY.
Did anyone think this guy would win?
I cant imagine being this delusional smh.
This has been a huge disappointment.
Every black Republican after Trump 🤔🤔🤔
Are elections really honest and free in the world's greatest bastion of democracy now?
Sure would've liked Larry Elder to become Cali's new governor smh! Hate that we have to be stuck with Newscum again 😠 😔
God Bless Larry and they will get their day and get rid of the rats in the swamp
and a heck of a man he is stay tough Larry
crawl back in to the radio shithead ... where you came from..... newsome is trash for sure..... but we need to do much better than this
🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🦝🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑=🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺
The people have spoken. Go home!
Haaaa HAHAHAHAh! You moved to CA just to run for Gov and you lost! HAAHAHAHAH!
How could Cali be so racist? Denying a POC the election like that, for shame!   Is that how it works?
They keep trying to say the elections are rigged but the voters voices speaks louder. I think some of the republican election winners needs to be recalled or investigated. They only cry fraud if they loose or if they think they can gain a seat.
The irony is that Newsome would likely have been recalled if not for Elder and his flirtation with Trumpism. He scared the liberal majority into voting for Newsome instead of sitting out.
That's it.. Republicans shouldn't even bother to vote its all rigged
Just another Trump clone loser licking his wounds .!
True Elder, You brought up a lot of topics and possible solutions for California's problems. Newsom will continue to look like a fk-ing idiot if he doesn't fix any of the problems you brought up.
CA has spoken: We believe in getting vaccinated, wearing mask.  Bye Bye Larry Elder. Move to Florida to be with your puppet Master Trump.
Get the fudge out of here crazy larry.
Wow an actual republican admitting defeat.... this is what we need more of. I respect this guy for at least that
I'd make the guess that the winner was DOMINION !
I totally figured the very first word would be fraud.
effing republicans should play the power ball every week..they seem to know whats going to happen in the future??? and they can't or won't stop it in the present???? and their maga idiots believe them....lol
THANK GOD HE LOST.. CALIFORNIA DODGED A BOMB... AND AMERICA HAS ONE LESS SH°IT STAIN TO CLEAN UP AFTER BEING WORN....
So what does this guy actually stand for then?
😂 😂 😂
May the wind be at your back
"How am I doing?" You lost so ....not so good? Was it close? :(
Knowing Democrats They are good in rigging the system so I doubt it. It's rigged same procedure as always
No one's listening to you Larry and you are never going to win anyway LOSER
Why tho? Why air stupidity?
His "fraud" complaint copy+pasted multiple pages from Lin Wood's "fraud" complaint from last year. Touch grass, loser.
Loser Larry! LOL
California the home for the homeless and illegals, jobs for all in California especially around San Francisco area..
You got to be kidding I am tempted to leave California because Newson needs to go
Yayy he lost!  Now we can go back to paying 50% income tax and wading through protests, homeless, and fires on the way to work!  Oh wait, I need gas, only $4.95?  Its cheap today!  Orange man bad!
Loser larry. Now let's turn Callie Commie!
Thanks big Koch and Right wing, anti worker con money for pushing for a recall that ultimately cost the tax payor of California 200 plus million dollars.  Take you phony Right wing populism & get lost.
At least he conceded. There's that.
Another Joke ... "how am I doing?"... YOU LOST, GO SIT DOWN. Nobody cares what you do next!
Still waiting for a health care plan from the GQOP. Finger pointing in the conservative circle jerk won't get you votes. Giving money to the 700 club EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN HYPOCRITES BUTTHURT bc their fuehrer/messiah wannabe lost the election will only get you [ thoughts and prayers ] they'll get a newer plane.
Now let's see if he can out-Trump Trump.  You think he has Trump-like tantrums in him?
Simple takeaway,  You were wrong on the issues from a California perspective,  We voted, we chose decisively..,.perhaps move to a redder state where your politics might work,  But Larry, don't play the Trump "rigged" card,,,it won't fly here in our state,
He played the RACE card........the election was stolen.
Newsom deserved a recall. Let’s hope that California gets governed better
It's OK Larry you were up against an evil mob of cheating Communists. Space Force has the real count and many more traitors just got caught.
I HEARD  THAT GAVIN NEWSOM WON LIKE ERICK ADAMS??? 🤔🤔🤔 REMEMBER WHAT BIDEN SAYS ONCE : “ NO MATTER WHO “ VOTES” IS  WHO COUNTED THE VOTES” SO...., WHO COUNTED THE VOTES HERE?....🤔
Losing is the Non for them 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Go
No one can hear you.
😳
You know what I just come to realize United States citizens are just as bad as politicians now see if you can figure out what I mean by that......
How pathetic of the people in Cali , your state is going to shit . But you keep voting the same ole people in office . Sad sad pathetic people
Oh poor Larry elder the republicans don’t care bout you they just care that u we’re gonna remove masks 😂
The democrats in that state are the most stupid ever! I have no respect for them any more! Patriots, Businesses, just move out of state! The governor, And democrats their are just going to make your lives miserable!
Sorry you lost Larry. You would have made a great Governor.
*NEWSOM* yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy💃💃💃💃💃💃💃🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕴🕴🕴🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺 I am Black, and I approve this message!
CONGRADULATIONS DEMOCRATS , YOU ALL MANAGED TO STEAL AND CHEAT ANOTHER ELECTION, LARRY ,YOU ARE FAR MORE BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA!!!
FIX THE ELECTION PROCESSSSSSSSS. MAKE IT WORK.
Aww I’m so sorry he lost his campaign! Joyce Carr Jones
Libertarians believe Government should fun police, Army... that's about it.
The people there must be either stupid or stupid. They continue voting for their state to decline. You would think that they would jump at the idea of getting Gavin out. I truly don't understand.
Larry Elder is keeping it real!
you deserve what you voted for.. I guess California people don't want a change...
It's a good speach but I don't think it falls in line with his party's national message.
Well THAT was a massive waste of taxpayer dollars ! Thanks Elder!
Carry your SA and go
It’s all just free-advertising for this clown...don’t cover him.
The link will help you understand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UC96g1A4Nc
Larry is brilliant, well spoken, and straight up classy.  It's too bad Californians made the choice they did :,(
Larry the loser!
We will put up the remember January 6th insurrection memorial
Awww his wife “ Mrs Snow White  stood there in a drunken stupor trying to figure out how to get as much money from the divorce as possible .
Since no officials will dare to do a forensic audit in Cali. Next step is for folks to leave the state and crash its economy for good.
Bahahahhaa 😂
And now, Newsom is in place to continue his decimation of California. The people of California are now officially held hostage by terrorist newsom. Disgraceful.
What were these people thinking? Republican for the republic of California?
Bye You P.O.S
Donald Trump should take notice. This is how you act when you lose an election. I don't live in California, I probably wouldn't have voted for Mr. Elder if I did, but I can respect him for this.
Gasssss!!! Prices
We went to thank the republicans for waisting a bunch of money just to prove that we hate your racest guts.
California DESERVES to continue its spiraling, free fall into a facist distopia.
Republicans: "Hollywood and entertainers are the devil and they drink the blood of children!"  Also Republicans: "Oh boy, I can't wait to vote for reality tv stars and talk show radio hosts!"
Two things. Audit the recall. Elect Larry Elder 2022.
Love to see a token black man in a party of white supremacists. He must love the attention and the money.
Wow, Read the comments and you can feel the passion that many have for keeping things the way they are.  California is already it's own Country; Similar to Venezuela, so lets make it official by removing California from the U.S.
He lost just like Republicans lost the 2020 election lmaooo 😂😂😂 bye ✌️ Elder get over it
Larry Elder and his supporters lost.  Now move on.
"How am I doing "?  He lost  ...  lol  ...   Reparations for slave holders who lost their 'property'? He is off his rocker like his idol....
Another Loser GOP. Not surprising in any way. Losers
Democrats cheated. Again.
Your not a black man you're a black man trying to be white
The GOP is on its way out......
Used to like Larry Elder until he said the 2020 election was free and fair. Very predictable that this election would be stollen from him
So full of shit….give me a break.
What a fake
California lost  😡 not this guy
California just showed us that it's happy living on the streets shooting heroin, it doesn't want help. We're in big trouble. And I don't mean California, I mean the human race if there's this many people who believe everything CNN tells them.
Just like his protégée “Uncle Ben”.  White folks won’t be having him at the dinner table anymore
Stand up people
Well, at least he didn't go the Trump route and continue on his "if I don't win it's fraud" theme. It'll be the death of democracy if one side scream cheating everytime the get whipped at the ballot box.
Rigged election once again
What a loser
Cry baby sit down shut up you lost again
Audit, Audit, Audit!!!!
They rigged presidential election, and does anyone think this wasn't rigged as well, cmon man
Oh no. You mean we're stuck with Gavel Newsom? God help us
The people have spoken. 💪🏽🇺🇲
I HEAR A ABONDENCE OF RAIN vibes from this
Go back to your talk show idiot
I didn’t always side with Elder, but man this guy knows how to handle loss—major props for that.
I for one am happy you lost, thank God.
The black face of white supremacy.
newsom murdered citizens and then bribed their neighbors at the same time taxing them more lmao what a crap show
Fraud all you sheep out there
It’s not who votes, it’s who counts the Votes that matters.  I am not surprised one bit, and there was no way he was going win against The rigged voting machines.  That how Dem’s get re-elected every time. It’s the only way Demarats can win. Been doing it for years now.
This wasn't an election loss, it was Elder abuse. Pick the most obnoxious candidate you can and expect to win. Just gotta love the GOP.
Trump and Elder lost 2 to 1.  Trump's big lie is losing everywhere.
none of those things you said are republican values! those are gavins values. your SCAM didnt work! maybe in the south it would. but we are SMART! NOONE WANTS YOU! 7-8 weeks? you are a joke. go back where you came from. you are as "smart" as trump. bye bye, annoying man. you are in the wrong party. you DONT UNITE! you are a lying 2-faced foole.
I voted for Larry Elder. They didn't ask for I.D., because it's easier to committ fraud
I LOVE THIS GUY!
Very gracious.  If we didn't know who Larry Elder is, we do now.
Elder would have been an awesome governor. It's too bad that so many people would rather live in squalor than give the other side a chance. Have fun with your high taxes, crap roads, failing schools and human feces on your sidewalks.
The sign "california or bust" still apply?
Thank God I don't live there! California is a bunch of idiots for not voting for the right man! Keep on going Larry
Trump the great divider.....
For the record, Larry elder did not lose. California just tighten the noose that was already around its neck, and pulled the lever.
MAGAs got crushed.  You love to see it.
Now please go hide back up tRumps ass.
,                              IF NEWSOM IS NOT DOING HIS JOB HE SHOULD NOT BE CASHING HIS CHECK  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Oh my god he really pulled a play straight out of trump’s playbook with people coming up to him crying lmaooooo. Does he not realize no one believes that dog shit?
Question why were the envelopes different colors per party isn't that a form of cheating. Newsom allowed criminals to be set free and kill again he is forcing body violation his choices have caused massive division his hypocrisy has caused mistrust in government. Other then handing out free money what has he done? Half of kaisers nurses are quiting. The reality is  Bleak
Nah, he won. There are real-time videos (from CNN and MSNBC) of hundreds of thousands of votes begin erased from the "YES" row on live air. A few thousand, I could understand. But hundreds of thousands? Nah. The cabal stole this one just like they stole the 2020 election and GA's senatorial race.
If Elder is the California Republican champion then we are fucked.  Faulkner, former mayor of SD should have been the Republican flag bearer.  But Republicans are too fucking stupid to support a good candidate.
Elder is the Match🔥what a Hero trying to save the zeros !
They’re not going to listen now, it’s back to business as usual. Until the way the Left Riggs elections is addressed nothing will change.
What is this guys plan to fix  homelessness... is it more mean spirited individualism?
He certainly gave it one heck of a try.
Like the 2020 election this one wasn't fair either. Pray for us people. Newsom is going to go on a rampage. He will make us pay, just wait.
Biggest loser!
All you leftist democrats in California get what you deserve. And don't cry about later when it all falls down!
California voted no to conspires, lies, and trump.  God Bless America.
Proud of this Black for wanting to solve the problems to HIGH TAXES, HOMELESS PPL, etc, etc.
When I hear someone complain about "white privilege" then turn around and vote for the definition of white privilege...Gavin Newsom! 🙄
Those libs RIGGED the recall election …by appealing to intelligent adults!  (a LOT MORE) How are Republicans ever supposed to compete against THAT kind of strategy?!
You lost!    Get over it!   And a black Republican?    You fools ain't even real!
Much as I dislike Elder, this wasn't a bad speech. But he should have been gracious and conceded.
Looks like Newsom will win the recall election with a higher percentage of the vote than in his original 2018 landslide victory. You spent millions of CA tax dollars to make your opponent look even MORE popular. There is no possible way for you to spin this as any kind of victory.
Didn’t Gavin promise everyone a $500.00 a month….learned to try to pay for votes like Biden did….well if that is why you voted for him I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting. Not a peep about it since. What a disgrace that state has turned into to. SHEEP
be quiet Elders America has had enough of failed conservatism.  it may take us 50 years to pay off the conservatives $30 trillion dollar National Debt, but we will never forget it is conservatism that failed and nearly bankrupted America
What a shame. I seems like nothing can save California, specially when it doesn't want to be helped.
Chasing the "American Dream" marrying a white woman, still won't work, and it won't get you to be Governor, But continue to go against black people, you can go a lot further.
These fools wannabe trump so bad that they even adore losing and being a loser just like him😂  They even follow and tell his same exact lies that have been proven over and over again to be exactly that, LIES!   Can't make this shit up if I wanted to of this disconnected, domestic terrorist and racist complicit party who call themselves conservatives.
Thanks for trying Larry
Cheaters and LIARS  like Newsome and his cronies will soon be brought  to justice.....their day is coming ....justice will be served ..
This guy really thought simply parroting trump was going to get him elected
Another election stolen right in front of our faces. After all the Gavin has put California through do you really believe he won😂🤣🙄. We are turning into Venezuela corrupt and a government full of cheaters.
Hey Trumptards, the people have spoken. They don't like Trump, they don't like Trump mini me's, they don't like false claims of fraud! Hope you don't learn anything from this.
The most eloquent and optimistic concession speech I have ever heard. I'll stay tuned Mr. Elder.
Loser thinks that he is "forcing" someone.  We are only forced to put up  with the idiocy of this idiotic traitorous party.
Did he really just say he raised attention about energy to the establishment. I think this loss made Larry forgot which party he’s in lmaoooo
its a shame he didn't win......if they always do what they always did they'll always get what they always got.....California is the crotch of America when it comes to people in charge.
California is predominantly a Democrat state.  Getting all the Republican votes will not get you the win.  You need people to cross the line.  You need democrats to vote for you as well. You need a common ground. You win by votes.
Can't get pass the huge lips...sorry lol
Sore loser 😆
If you don't believe in Science you'll end up at the ICU begging to believe.
Californians, can you please go kill yourselves now? Stupidity like what you just displayed should not be allowed to exist.
Claim Election Fraud; The new way of The GOP to cheat to win; F'n embarrassing that Trump started this BS. tactic.
Dadabhoy I love myself so me Larry Elder. He is the future of California
Impatience is part of why this did not succeed.  We should have held on to hope to change leadership when Newsom's term was over.  Patience is always important, bide your time and we'll get we want.
Yeah, and the south shall rise again... the Democrats might not do good work, but a radio personality like Elder is hardly the champion of fixing it.
When a state is 2/3 democrat we can keep expecting these results. They stick together like Biden's hands on children. We just have to fight California as a nation and stand up to the progressives.
Dear California. Live with what you have even as you burn and please don't bring your ignorance to Texas.
He's concerned about homelessness, but wants the minimum wage to zero? The math ain't mathing...
Larry’s the man!
The Trump endorsement works its magic once again........lol
Good thing Larry kept his day job!
get ready for fuhrer newsome to take revenge with covid mandates
So funny they believe the election was rigged when trump lost but Not when he won 🤣😂🤣✌🏼
Me at the California polls - the BALLOT doesn't tie your name to it!  No bar-code saying this VOTE is YOURS!  Yes, you sign at the door only. The ballot is a number tally within that precinct!  WE NEED VOTER-ID NOW!
Give an example of the uniting please.
Larry is the best,,, God bless him 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️
“Hard work wins” ?!?! This clown posted allegations of voter fraud to his website the night BEFORE voting day. This dishonest Trump sycophant posted that he lost due to voter fraud before any votes were cast. The whole GOP strategy is to constantly scream “Fraud!” without any evidence, so they can pass legislation to disenfranchise voters. They know they cannot win if everyone votes.      They will cheat as they loudly proclaim they have been cheated. There is no longer any honor in the GOP.
God bless Larry, don't give up, we are still with you.
Larry when you run for President you have my vote
This idiot is blaming everyone but himself hahaha 🤣 what a fucking joke of a person
Shut up, you goddamned Fascist.
Will you admit that you got crushed?
California has decided there fate.  Now we wait and see
Yeah we're pretty stupid out here. 🤦
Okay bye Larry. Go back to doing whatever the hell it is you do.
Not sure if you won or not but I am positive the recall vote was fraudulent
Blather blather blather… meaningless.
This self-loathing, loud mouth fast-talking used car salesman got a spanking last night and I think he liked it - freaky!!!!
Haha let’s keep rolling the dice on the word freedom .God save us all .
All this man has are conspiracy theories.
he souds like trump
I DO NOT BELIEVE WE LOST AGAIN THEY STOLE OUR ELECTION,EVIL DEMOCRATS CHEATED ON THE VOTE,THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN  DEMOCRATS ARE EVIL CORRUPTED LIERS GOD ONLY CAN DESTROY THEM ,GOD WILL LET THEY DESTROY THEIR OWN SELF ,HOW DESTROY CALIFORNIA OUR KIDS ARE IN THE STREETS FULL OG DRUGS,CORRUPTION BECAUSE OF THIS ADULT LET DRUGS COME  TO DESTROY OUR KIDS, VERY  sAD 😢
What they stolen  again  unbelievable,  this people are the worse. Well sorry California😥😥😥😥
loser... complete loser.
Damn! America is toast.
Stop the steal!!
Please tell us mr Elder what was your plan to end homelessness
Republicans can’t beat the liberal Democrats. There are not listening, California is going to steam roll there full control over the people. Say good by freedom, but there is one way to actually win. Do not comply with vaccine mandates, do not put mask that do not work at on your face. And stand against law breaking communist in America. Or we will not have freedom any longer. This goes for all states. God bless you all
THIS ASSWIPE NEWSOM PAID BIG MONEY TO GET VOTES.
Oh please!
The bull$#*t rhetoric didn't help his chances. . .
Why do liberals have so much hate for conservatives?
Hahahaha, you are just "upset" you lost big time Mr. Elder. We can tell by your straight face, no smiles no expression. You didn't promise anything good to this state - maybe after this big disappointment on your side you will learn to offer at least something good to people; but, I know you don't even know how to offer a good thing - you belong to the trump clan.
Yeah they would have done a better job if trump giving them the help I don’t see you telling the truth another trump cult lier
Republicans would take care of the California homeless issue in weeks... it would involve buses, towboats, barges, and scuttling explosives
you bitch about things, but offer no plan on how to fix them.   the entire republican platform is "bitch/complain/blame"  but you take no accountability, you take no effort to pay for programs that the community needs, you take the needed funds and give it to the least needy among us (corporations and megarich).  You don't focus on the issues that actually affect our country.  So what do you actually stand for besides complaining and finger pointing?   WHen was the last time the republicans actually stood for something besides their megarich donors?      Seriously Larry, you lost because you are out of touch and are part of a bandgwagon of hate/apathy and ignorance that you can no longer control and you all are just trying to ride like a tidal wave thats about to crash down on our country and wreck it from within with the sheer volume of angry idiots that have joined your cause.   Push for education, push for voters rights, push for making democracy MORE inclusive,   PUsh for things like Ranked choice voting systems and Non Gerrymandered redistricting.  Push for environmental regulations that stop the issues plaguing us as a society.  But you wont...you'll blame/deflect/rile and shirk responsibility just like mitch and the others.   IM glad you lost.   Newsom is not the best candidate for California, but he is a damn sight better than any republican that is running.
YOU AIN’T FORCING ANYONE TO DO SPIT, BUT WHAT YOU DID DO WAS MAKE VOTERS RUNNNNN TO THE POLES TO MAKE SURE YOU DID NOT TAKE OFFICE!
Poor Ole Larry
Ha ha ha ha ha
BLM movement had a lot of force behind them..... look what that caused.
PURE COMEDY 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Delusional trumptards are delusional.
Taxafornia citizens are not the brightest bulb in the box. Larry Elder is the man.
Trump-Elder 2024 🇺🇸
You wanted to force him out.
This dorky idiot is talking as if he lost an election, not a watery, lame recall.
Guess being a Mini Trump is not the path to success that he thought it was?  If he would have been a voice of reason, others might have listened. Actually if he would have come out with the words in this speech instead of the rhetoric of the Orange Menace, he might have done well. 🤷🏻‍♀️
You almost CERTAINLY ARE NOT,....SIR!
Larry said he forced us to change things that should have been changed 2 yrs ago💡💡💡 Wasn't your beloved trump in charge then 🤣🤣🤣So you admit he didn't know a Damn thing Just like yourself Larry. You're a Big @$$ Joke 🤣
The recall was another GOP $276,000,000 boondoggle. Wasting Californians money, again!
Why pay attention  to a bunch of corrupted  Republicans  you lost just like your  ex lying president    liars vote Blue if you want to save this country  from lies vote vote
It's not force. It's pressure! You are pressuring him to do better, but failed to convince the people that you are that better person.
Holy cow he actually admits he realizes he lost. Big babby steps for conservatives
THATS ALL THE FIRE HE HAS ?,,,DISAPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST,,,IM DONE WITH TRUMP, ,AND IM DONE WITH ELDER !
California has a glimmer of hope..... and then they said "no" to Larry Elder.  Keep your homelessness California.  Keep your drugs.  Keep your outrageous housing rates.  Keep it all!  You're a tourist state.  You post pictures of what everyone thinks CA SHOULD look like.  But it doesn't really look like that.  It looks like trash.  I hope you're happy!
If he stays away from Trump's b******* he might be all right but if he jumps in line with Donald Trump f*** him
Somewhere a cuckoo clock is missing its cuckoo.
I love the way he thinks. I contributed to his campaign and I’m sad to see that he lost but very hopeful for the future
Last I heard there was still 4.5illion votes to count. How is it over?
Leave it up to the white elite to throw a black man under the bus and place a rich white man on a pedestal.. no surprise there.
You take the vaccine the story ends , you wake up in your bed & believe whatever you want to believe . You remain unvaccinated you stay in wonderland , & you’ll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes . - Unvaccinated Morpheus 2021
Don't expect anything to be done for CA
Y’all know he won! Ballot printing mofos!
Larry doing what he does best. Grift, rake in the cash from idiot cons, and stir up drama. He knew he was going to lose, he just sees and opportunity to make a ton of money for himself and his racist buddies.
That is a good man! Any one who says different is a fool. God will use him for the good of California despite the demoncrats.
California wants to stay the sheep they are.  They oughta annex themselves.
Two politicians and neither are qualified to do the job. Damn sounds familiar
This man has nothing but platitudes to say.  Totally empty suit.
That sellout can get lost. He got a ass whipping.
Look at all the racist democrats in the comments 😂🤣😂 You can pass all of the civil rights you want but you can't take the racist out of the democrats. Always have been always will be.
So we are suppose to believe California voters voted for newsom?  I absolutely don't believe that one bit.
It was a farce. Election fraud
Yay Woo Hoo 😎 delusions of grandeur.
Isn't this the same guy who was on tv in the 80s as a judge 🤔 if so I now have a better understanding of the type of people in the new opertunist party. Cause the Republican party died with John McCain.
You didn't force Trump to do anything but divide and betray this country. Look at black Trump, I hope his radio station tank. Larry Elder quit lying we are are stupid enough to believe anything coming from your mouth.
They (Californians) all realized just how big a mistake it would have been to have the trumpian minion elder as gov. You lost, go away. Another delusional republican.
See what happens when u go against you YourOWN people u Loose
So sorry MR Elder. I was hoping you would have won..prayer from Michigan...I read how some went to vote but couldn't cause they were told they already voted. That fraud
Hey democrats,  if you call this a win you are even more stupid than we thought you were. And to all of you dip shitz that think  newsome is good for California,  you have oatmeal for brains just like joe🖕
His father probably rolling over in his grave looking at what and who his son has become.
Since when have Republican politicians cared about homeless people? Note, I said Republican politicians specifically. Don't  @ me. 😂😂😂
Another WAKE UP moment for Americans. The system is rigged!
Larry elder used to be white but, he drank too much of the orange koolaid and woke up the next day a confused black man.
Leftists hate God, love high rent prices, high gas prices, high amounts of homelessness, love forest fires etc. California has been destroyed due to decades of leftist policies.
More than likely rigged. Gavin was extremely disliked. But hell. People love living in a shit show and getting free things. I love getting given free money
California deserves whatever the hell happens.
Win what war? Most of the homeless people don’t want help. Los Angeles tried to get them off the streets but they won’t leave. The GQP believe in nothing but division and hate. Trump is your god and we rejected him in CA.
Guess he didn’t work hard enough. Loser.
I no longer believe in justice on this earth. What a FARCE. No one liked Newsom. This man DESERVED to win. California is being run by a tyrant. God help California. God help the USA too. Our president is a tyrant and not even paying attention to the science all the while accusing conservatives of being anti-science. It is absolute insanity.
The biggest losers from the recall are California taxpayers who have to pay for this Republican scam.  During the first impeachment of Trump, didn't' they dismiss it by saying "That's what elections are for"?
What the hell has happened to the Republican Party? Bunch of phony conmen.
Forcing them to pay attention to all these things while spending money on this election?  Even if Newsom needed to go, this guy lost the election by throwing in his ridiculous wants.  Oh well.
This smells fishy, Biden shows up in Long Beach, the biggest cheater in our country, then Gava trash wins the recall. Please.
I'm surprised Newsom still has a job? Are dems wacked out there!?
Did this guy get bumped on the head???
Losers Lose...
Hope these Californians don’t come to Colorado  then
Got your ass whipped.  What a loser.  Trump will drop this guy so fast for embarrassing him
Another gd loser for the republicans to martyr.
Traitor trump lost the popular vote TWICE, meaning the majority of Americans don't want trumpism. Yet the GOP keep on propping up these trump clones who keep losing elections and can't figure out why they loose 🤣🤣🤣
Yes, the election was lost but we will win the war. Oh my gosh what a MAN he is!
Larry is one big crackpot.  He's like Herman "9-9-9" Cain but crazier.  If you remember, Herman refused to get vaccinated, went to a Trump event, and died of COVID related illnesses.  Larry are you next?
It wasn't close. It's over. The people of California made their choice. Next topic.
But yet you contested the election...C'mon MAN!!!
We already know there was fraud
Another rip off!
You where robbed... When are we going to say enuff bullshit ... Votes don't count If it's rigged
Larry and his ilk knew they were going to lose. They admitted it before the election even started. They just wanted to cry "rigged elections!" and waste more money and time while people like Larry rake in donations for themselves. Conservatives are fools.
Rigged again. Terrorist runs the country
Conservatives "will we ever have an honest election again ?"  Also Conservatives "oh wait, we won?  MOST SECURE ELECTION EVER!!!"
RIGGED!
Trump stooge.
Mr elder, I just want you to know we in Oregon wish that you would come up here and get rid of our governor and help straighten Oregon out again. California is a wasted useless state and you might as well go somewhere that could really and want your help. Come up here and help us. All those people that would not recall Gavin newsom gets exactly what they deserve. You had great ideas you had a way to help California become a great state again and they didn't want to do it probably because they're not very educated and they didn't see what the garbage that's in Congress right now is doing. Come here and help us. The hell with California just let it fall apart. My friends that live down there are totally disgusted that they didn't recall the biggest loser that they've ever seen in the United States along with our president. That's why most of our companies will not come to California because of exactly what just happened. They don't want to do the right thing. I'm very sorry that you didn't win and I'm very sorry that the people in California are just that ignorant. Reconsider coming to Oregon and helping us. Best regards.
Its because california is racist
I'd you didnt vote for larry you are a racist.
all elections are rigged not elected but appointed if we dont fix 2020 we dont have secure elections!
Same old, same old, how honest do you think the election was?
Loser! Just like Trump
Shame on you Larry,  Bye bye, you act like you are Martin Luther king.
California has an opportunity to unfuk itself but chose not too. Should just purge that state from America.
Buh-bye black Trump.
I blame Larry Elder for Gavin Newsom keeping his job. I'm sure a ton of Californians would have considered recalling Gavin Newsom if the alternative wasn't Larry Elder. I'm not even sure at this point anymore, but Republicans would do much better if they could get behind a moderate or a conservative Democrat.
You lost the battle, I we will make sure you DONT win the war. Sit down...nobody wants to go back to where we were 50 years ago. Racists know that one of their greatest tools is using black people to keep other black people down. All of the bs is coming to the light...and you can thank your last president for exposing you.
It's official, California is racist.
Sorry California couldn't recognize a good man when they had the chance
People went in to vote and were told that they had ALREADY VOTED!! Probably just the tip of the election fraud iceberg! If we tamely submit to this bullshit we'll eventually lose everything!
California is a shithole who deserves a shithead to run it. I will never go back.
rats... recall didn’t work... Let’s impeach Gov Newsom !!
Good job larry! Back to conspiracy radio for you bum!
Hey at least he admitted that he did not win.  Very different from november
As a Californian my warning to people in other states is this: Please don't let people from my state move to your state unless you have properly vetted them. They will ruin your states just like they did this one if you don't! Before selling Californians any property, make sure they aren't Leftists! Check their social media if you have to! If they are Leftists, do not sell any property to them! Force them to wallow in the very hell they have created and voted for here! Thank You.
BLAH BBAH BLAH KICK ROCKS
No place for an Afro American to become a black governor in a racist state.
This recall was a waste of taxpayer money.
Larry Elder didn’t lose.  The truth will ooze soon.  It always does.
go home u lost
What a waste of money.
California is racist for not selecting Larry Elder.
No way in hell did larry lose...this was stolen!!!
Sure would be a shame if there was fraud found in this election.
Goes to show we don't vote for someone because "they are Black". Every skin folk is not Kin folk!
We all know this election was rigged- democrats in charge guarantees fraud
Elder is part of the same plan like Trump  Fake
Larry Elder was humiliated!!!!!!!!         🇺🇸
