I wish we could help people like that.
Aw bless you, sweet doggy.
Bless you for saving this precious soul! 👍🏻❤️🙏🏻
So in California; the vet doesn't speak English; they're most likely illegal a.d need to be deported; doesn't matter of their knowledge of dogs
i'm BEGGING anyone who's even slightly lost in life to read Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers. i'm not kidding when i say it cracked me open in the best way. i'm crying and healing and evolving all at once ❤
always love your videos
And now he lives with someone who is convinced he's reactive and mussles him in public 😂 fuckin glossed over that one didnt ya dodo
Bravo! Dogs are Love!
Anyone can adopt an easy non reactive dog.  To adopt a Reactive dog takes a special person.  Great job Danielle.  You saved him.  Sometimes I see people with these easy dogs and I wonder if they've ever owned a reactive dog.  What a great story.  Glad he found you
It's videos like this that get me through the day.
Beautiful story, beautiful hearts.
Why can't people be half as awesome as dogs.
God bless all of you who helped Dennis recover and to those of you who continue to have a positive impact on his life. Great little video
That happy sad 'Byeee, Dennyyy !' at the end: 😥🥹💔😢😭
malinois have crazy memory, they come back you ask "dude where's your ball?" then they go tearing off two fields back straight for where they left it. They're such a life changing dog to own
THANK YOU for being a good person.
Star Chambers for anyone who abuses animals...
What a beauty. ❤
When is met my Nikki (a Belgian, as many cop pointed out) in ASPCA she was curled up in the back corner of her kennel cage and the only dog that was nonreactive as I passed. My last pass she looked at me and that was it. Our first stop leaving the pound was vet. A few thousand bucks later she spent her life of 16 years by my side. Never one regret.
I fucking love dogs soooo much.  People who hurt them are evil!
"But you're here, and you have a person now" that's when i lost it. 😭♥️
Hit him with a shovel?  Doesn't that seem oddly specific?  Unless there was a shovel shaped imprint on the dog, how would a vet determine the dog was struck with a shovel.  Not a car bumper somewhere nearby.  Not a 2-by-4 or a really good kick.  Vet thinks it was attacked with a shovel.
THANK YOU!
where did you get your sandals please bro?
Graças a Deus dogajudado brigada 🙏🙏🐕‍🦺👏👏🌞🌞🌞😋😋😋😋👍👍👍🐕‍🦺☝️☝️🙏🙏🙏🙏
Overwhelming. Thank you. (More than words) thank you.❤
how did they know to film the whole thing?  it always seems suspicious.
Oh lord he was meant to be your dog 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The woman speaking is so fake. Clearly reading very badly from a script.
WTF is up with saying "Oh my _goodness!"_ to pets in the most babyish voice possible, and how do we get people to stop?
Dog wants to leave her
I love people some are good
Ugh 😣, I want to cry thinking about this poor sweet boy getting hit with a shovel and being terrified of humans 😢. There’s a special place in Hell for people who do things like that to defenseless, innocent animals. Thank you for saving him!
💛
After tons of warmongering and doomsday messages all day this video gives me hope for humanity.
Someone said, “we don’t deserve dogs.”
Such a lovely outcome.
Thank you both!
Lovely
God Bless him and all of you who helped him.
💙
A precious handsomee Malinois
Love this story!
Beautiful dog and people.
A throw away by Mexican military. US gives them lots of dogs and they treat them like trash. The only people worse are in the Middle East.  US gives them lots of military dogs, too.
Thank You  or these videos.  I watch them because they restore  my faith in humanity and the pure, unconditional  love of animals.
He looks just like my kooky girl! Such wonderful kiddos with only love to give!!
Morley Field! COOL!
How can you hurt a dog there a loving gift from god.
Incredible. I'm obsessed with this breed🤗🥰
What a sweet boi!!  Thank you for loving him!
I have a shelter Dutch/Mal and she's just a lovebug.
What a beautiful dog. I can't think of what would happen if you didn't pull him out of the mud. Life would go out of him real fast. Good to be so active and don't hesitate like too many people always do. Direct action is so important in many ways. THANK YOU!!!
Praise God for these people
God bless white people, the true caretakers of the world's animals. third world countries lack empathy.
BEAUTIFUL LOVELY ENDING HAPPY DAYS !!!!
Beautiful dog, I’m not  seeing  how anybody could hurt him like that. That’s just horrible. 😢 thank you for saving them.
Thank you
Thank you Jesus ❤. Blessed
Beautiful puppy ❤
All animals remember who helped them out. Such a happy ending for a sweet, beautiful pup.
Beautiful dog - ugly 'human". God bless the rescuer and vets.
Great !
Thanks
Who, in this world, would hit a dog wit a shovel???  What kind of monsters live on this planet?  This is coming from an avid hunter. I never want my prey to suffer any more than it has too. Doing this to a dog is evil and hateful. Lord help me if I ever see a human abusing a defenseless creature.
I hope that every living being that is suffering finds someone like both of you to help them. 💕
Mexicans
I utterly despise a lot of humans! Dogs are sent by god to show us what real love looks like. Imagine being that evil you hit one with a shovel.
I just don't get this 'foster' thing that happens in the US.  Animals think they have a new home and then get torn away from it. It must make them fearful for the rest of their days. Here in the UK they are adopted from the adoption center and they go off to their 'forever' homess with their new family.
A lovely story, thank you. Go Vegan.
You people are awesome . You saved him.
Animal abuser -> no matter what they do or how much effort they put into something will never prosper.
Poor little baby
😣🥹ty❤
❤❤❤ thank you
Animals don't forget.
GOD BLESS YOU!  thank you so much for helping this angel!
Very good of you to help him. I would think finding a badly injured dog it would be best to get advice before moving it in case you make the injury worse.
this is a very handsome dog, happy story! thanks.
He is a beautiful doggie.
This made me cry!
💙💙💙💙
Love this, it brought tears to my eyes.
Schlimm bei dieser Hunderasse ist vor allem, dass der Hund denkt, er hat was falsch gemacht. Sie sind immer nah beim Menschen, wollen alle Erwartungen erfüllen.
What a good boy!
Finally, this is what the world needs to see more of, not what is being shown everywhere these days, god bless these two wonderful people. And bless the pup as well.
I love happy endings. Yay!🤗😊
He didn't need to smell, he recognized his voice
Thank you ❤
thank u for saving his life! What a beautiful dog!  LOOK at that nose and eyes. Wow. Best from Colorado!
What a sweet boy.  So glad he was rescued.😊
Of course Denny remembers! Dogs are more intelligent than humans and here to teach us unconditional love ❤ Karma on that perpetrator! People that torture animals are sociopaths who eventually do bad things to humans next. I love that Denny is happy and strong and pulling at his leash even!!! 😊 What a wonderful story and thank-you to his rescuer and new forever person! You deserve only the best Denny!  🐶 ❤
You are a godly man
should i call him?yes ,just let him sniff you.....denny-hold my bone
wow this one got me............back to the onions
What a wonderful dog! Glad it worked out.
You dont do this to animals! Pure evil did this to the trusting dog. Karma will come!
We are so lucky to have them in our lives.  ❤❤dogs
I love a happy ending  😊
Thanks to the rescuer but I am very uncomfortable with a world where the first reaction to seeing an animal (or person) in distress is to whip out a cell phone and record the act of rescue. The only thing on anyone's mind should be to end the suffering, not make a self-congratulatory video about it.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What sort of abusive monster hits an animal with a shovel.   Animal abuse must be prosecuted by all countries.
Evil tried to crush that innocent, joyful, loving creature, but love and kindness won.
So Thankful she adopted him! He has been through enough and found his forever home!!❤ You are his Angel!
Rescues come with a ton of baggage, but they are still the BEST! Who’s a good boy? 😁
Love these stories but seeing how people always have a phone out to record.  Live and experience life. Tell the story
I love this channel!
I love that there are fosters who take in dogs, but that woman is not right for him. She's way too nervous and mals are very intelligent dogs and her nervousness will absolutely hold this dog back.  Mals are not for pet owners, especially one's who have no clue to working line dogs, let alone mals.
Oh this made me so happy to see. Thank you to all the people who have helped him on his recovery from abuse. It’s not always easy but oh so rewarding. ❤❤❤
What a wonderful dog!
WOW!  That would be A LOT for a first time dog mom to handle!  Great job!!
No good deed is ever wasted.  :)  Best to everyone involved.
Thanks for making me ball like a baby 😊 he will never forget what you did for him!!!
Absolute shame on you. This should not be about if this dog remembers you! Is this your show?! How depressingly human-centric.  Is your ego okay now?  🤢
A rescued dog like that will be a dog that will defend his rescuers with his life. Most dogs will. But a real rescued dog knows things a little bit different
You are both amazing humans!!!!! what a great story, thank you for sharing! 😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE FOR THE DOG AND OWNER
LOVELY
Of course he remember 😢his hero
I always pray and beg  to God everyday to protect all dogs in the world. God's love is always with them ! Sadhu Sadhu Sadhu
Denny, wishing you the happiest life. L o v e
I love animals more than I do most people, so when I hear of people abusing animals I get mad. This morning my brother wanted me to go outside with him and showed me a lost pug sitting in our neighbors yard. Then my other brother said that he had seen a dachshund running around earlier in the morning. So we spent an hour trying to get the pug and looking for the dachshund. The pug just kept running away and we were afraid that it would get too spooked and run into traffic. We are old people who can't run very fast.
God bless Benny and the people that saved him!
A stupid woman with a reactive dog...oh goody..
Good people.  Great dog.🎉
GOOD HUMANS!
Warms my heart THAT SWEETHEART WILL NEVER FORGET THE ONE WHO SAVED HIM 😢🙏👍👍
HE KNOWS AS SOON AS HE HERD THAT VOICE HELL YEAH NOTHING STOP HIM BLESS HIS HEART HE KNOWS HIS PEOPLE
People HURT HIM BUT HES A BRAVE BOY 🥲👍💙🙏
People like YOU ARE WHAT MAKES HUMANITY GREAT BY SAVING ANOTHER SOUL IN NEED
So Heartwarming.. ♥️
Definitely grab the tissues for this one❤❤
Super special puppy!!! ❤❤❤
A-dor-a-ble! 💞💞💕💕💗💗💝💝❤️💖💘💘🥰👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
❤
That proud, I found a stick walk, is adorable 💕🐾!
Beautiful ❤️❤️
You two are just the angels Denny needed to come into his life!   As for the criminal behaviour of his abuser…How can anyone treat any living thing with such cruelty?!!   You are considered lower than 💩, and not just by polite society, but by 95% of all society.
Beautiful boy! I think he smelt you even before he heard you and then saw you! Dogs never forget those who show them kindness and love. 💙
I thought he was a service dog because his harness says do not pet.
Special dog, special people.
Who could’ve hurt a dog like Denny! So nice of all of you to help him and thank you to Danielle for adopting such a good boy! ❤
😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG! The vet thinks he was hit in the head with a shovel!? Makes me feel sick and then really angry🤢😡 God bless you for rescuing him and showing him what love is!Awe ❤❤❤ some! xxoxxo
This is beautiful!  I hope Henry gets to have more visits with Denny.  Danielle is proving herself to be a great dog mom.
Thank You !!!!❤❤
❤🥹
Denny is absolutely gorgeous! Thank you so much for saving him! 🐾✨🙏❤️🙏❤️
My heart 🥹
He knew exactly 💯 who that guy was as soon as he laid eyes on him..she kept the leash so short I did not understand that part..he knew who his rescuer was.. immediately
How could any one strike an animal is beyond me. I am so happy you were there to help him and he now is learning what real love and trust is. Bless you all
Thank you for helping him. He knows who saved him! Love this!!
I actually met my wife at a animal shelter. I just met her and seeing her being so passionate about helping innocent animals, it was love at first sight. Never regret that decision for a second in my whole life
Absolutely wonderful video. Thank you so much for sharing Denny's story. ❤
Love him so much!
What a wonderful story with an even more wonderful reunion...
i would love to see another up date on this but something tells me she foster failed. i know i would have. you both did a great job with Denny.
A malinois! She who found him is the luckiest one.
Thank God this beautiful dog did heal! 🥰
Angels on earth❤
Thank goodness we have wonderful people in this world.
I love this!!!!
A soulful face with sweet eyes looking back at you. What monster could do that to an animal!
About a year ago my dog late at night escaped and found herself drowning in my neighbours pool. Thankfully the neighbour heard some noises outside and saved her.  Last month my dog had cancer and on her dying bed she didnt moved, just occasionally wagging her tail. My neighbour who saved her, came to say last goodbyes. As soon as she saw him, she got up instantly, smiling and wagging her tail. It was the last time she showed happiness.  Yes they do remember!
I love dogs like this color and breed
❤always in our hearts the ones who love us and who we love 💝
I’m crying this is the sweetest thing I have saw . Thank you guys for being Angels around the world my heart goes out to you ALL of you. He’s Happy they didn’t break is Spirit. Hallelujah.
What’s with the muzzle 🤬🤬🤬
Simply genius! And yes, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest in Greyzar Drinbo's PE Solution and now she keeps dragging me back lol
I love that there's gonna be a next time🖤
I hate people who could be so cruel to pick on something so helpless and and who abandoned their dog. Animals in a house can't find food like wild animals.  The do not possess the skills. Horrible people.
Denny is a champion! ❤
schäferhund mit maulkorb, why.
Awesome!
❤️❤️❤️🥰🤩😍👍🇨🇦
Fantastic
Oh my gosh! So sweet! Makes me want to be a better person.
those eyes ❤
OUTSTANDING   SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM WALK  BLESS YOUR HEARTS    good work   good job if you ever need help w/ a dog in alaska  let me know
Yep thanks for this, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest by Greyzar Drinbo and now she just can't have enough
God bless you Henry for rescuing this beautiful dog...I chose to focus on the uplifting spirit of people like yourself to do something to erase someone's cruelty to one of God's creatures...
Bless you all❤❤❤
Easily one of the most beautiful dogs i've seen
I'm not crying, you're crying.
He really wanted the dog and it got odopted out from under him the rescuer.
What a beautiful story 🥲🥹🥰. They do remember. A friend had pups and I gave her to my aunt. I had the pup for 1 night. Years later she still remembered me.❤
Dammit I was just watching clips about Dennis Wilsons' death and now I watched this clip about a dog named Denis and somebody around here is cutting up onions.
Salute to the handsome man with a great heart ! Thank you for saving Denny.
Global warming nope can't use that getting colder climate change make all those weather maps red . Raise carbon taxes turn propaganda machine to Max
Only an evil pos would harm a dog.
What a beautiful story! Thank you both for saving Denny!
What a beautiful doggie 😍 ❤️ 💕
Poor puppy. Amazing recovery! Thanks for helping him out.
I wait…I knew it was Henry from van life videos!!   Thank you so much for rescuing Denny!  Denny is a beautiful soul and so is Henry!   Dennys transformation is amazing!  Thank you to his foster parent for taking such great care of him!!   Wish I Could adopt Denny!
Morley field dog park in san diego!
มาขโมยกินหรือ
there is incredible cruelty in Mexico… i pray for more humane treatment of all animals.. & enlightenment..& for generous souls who bring love to these beautiful spirit dogs
Great story, wonderful for Denny
He is so BEAUTIFUL!!  He remembered you!🙏🙏♥️🥰😍😊
Belgian Malinois. Can't say enough about this amazing breed. I love them very much🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The girl is reading from a cue card. I hope you didn't send him to obedience school
❤
😍
Thank you so much.
Absolute perfection
Thank you ❤️🙏❤️🙏
The sadistic Mexican creep that hit a Malinois with a shovel could have sold it. Malinois prices for an adopted Mainois are up to $500 or much more if it's a good pedigree or trained.
An injured and abandoned Belgian found in a Mexican field, literally on his last legs? I bet this guy has a story to tell. And happy he's living to be a part of future stories.
This man is a hero…this dog will protect his family with his life. Thank you, Danielle ❤
Thank you to all who helped the poor guy.
Whoever hit him with a shovel deserves exactly the same.
More lies from scam artists
Poor baby. Hes so sweet. Who ever hurt him is a monster.
Fom Belgium, had 2 malinois. They're difficult, but the most precious loyal dogs. Enraged by thinking who would do something like that to such innocent souls...
Melt my ❤😊🐕
I never get why people would hurt an animal. It´s such a coward thing to do. Thankfully there will always be people around helping them out.  The unconditional love of an animal is most likely the best version of love.
Well done. We have a three year old blue rhone cocker and he is the best thing that has happened to us, dogs are simply beautiful. We are getting another puppy in a few months now. Kindness is so special and this lovely fella knows he’s ok now thanks for changing his life.
This dog looks so so much like my last GSD K9, kinda like NY new? But so much like Brie!
Good people doing Good Deeds reminding us that something as simple as showing love to an abused animal and seeing the immediate return of that same caring.
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
If you find out who hit him just let me know, I would love to show them my shovel.
So you just happen to come across a dog, in a field, half paralysed and can’t walk?? How t F did the dog get there??? BS!!!! And all you gullible idiots fall for this crap!!!! “Hit with a shovel” more steaming BS!! Wake up!!
“Let him sniff you first” shut up lol he knew that dog was okay 😂
You are amazing, keep doing!
beautiful turn around
That bit when he was offered food in the back of the car and instead just rested his nose in the hand. Onions!
Just give the address of who hit him with a shovel like that.... Give that address
Beautiful ending for Denny Thank You for all that made this happen,,,
The best !
Foster fail ❤️ Animal lovers of the world, unite! No more wars, factory farming, dog fighting. No more Bidens and Trumps and Putins. No more.
“he started to show “fear based reactivity” to strangers”  Can’t we just say “fear”?
You guys are amazing. Jesus bless you all. Amen ❤❤❤❤❤
thank you for helping these animals
Thank you for caring and helping.
Stray dogs in Mexico are treated like pests.  There is a joke that goes, "How do you tell the difference between a Mexican dog and an American dog?  When you bend over the Mexican dog runs."  This is because people in Mexico routinely throw rocks at strays.  They will swerve to hit them with cars, etc.  They do not have the spay or neutering culture that the US and Canada have.  It's really sad.  That is where this pup came from.  It's great to see him doing well now, but the overwhelming majority of strays are not so lucky there.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍🍏🦘🇦🇺
Thank you
Best video 💗💗💗💗💗
👍👏👏👏👏👍

one saved, great job, unfortunately many more not saved and never will be, they suffer at the hands of evil humans. I would dearly love to take a shovel to the abuser.
Friendship is forever !!
Lovely.
You just need to look at his eyes during the bath and the first walk, to see that this is an exceptionally smart dog. He will adapt and learn everything he needs to know, very quickly.
These uploads are gut wrenching sad but it's great to see another pup shown the love they deserve and come back from such trauma . well done to all responsible you have my complete and utmost respect.
Whay a great pup and story of redemption
God bless you for helping the helpless 😢❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
And some people say dogs don’t have emotions!!
He looks like a German Shepard/Greyhound mix.
I hope someone takes a BIGGER to the evil one who hurt this beautiful dog. So glad he got the happy ending & love he deserves❤️🐶👍🐾😊
These rescues always make my eyes wet.
That’s a great video
love this....
my gosh he is such a beautiful dog.
These are my kind of people. Love to you.
❤
Dogs Rule!
I prefer animals to people.
OMGGG, bless you so much for saving this dog's life... bless you...❤❤❤
I just don’t understand why people would do that to an animal.
The way he recognised his saviour shows us how smart dogs are and it shows that they've got great memory
What a great story and it's great to see that you rescued him to live a loving life as I know how much joy dog's bring to one's life I had to put my best friend to sleep as he was suffering from liver cancer I am lost without him by my side we had a beautiful 15 year's together I hope you guys have a great time together as he seems like a beautiful friend who will give you as much love as you give him
That's sweet!
A nice video
I like this story. It's better than my life.
a horror story ends like a fairy tale. thank you to everyone involved in giving this boy the life he deserves.
Dogs usually remember people they meet.  So, yeah.
I 💖 these people! 😍 It's Great to see the dogs personality return with a spring in the step!
so what if he doesnt like all people. neither do i! keeps you safer being more wary!
Why do they assume someone hit him with a shovel?  That was a strange assumption.  Farmers like dogs that chase away rabbits, gophers, crows, wild pigs, etc
♥
Like to hit the dirty Mexican that did this with a shovel.
Ah....damn allergies...
By the end of this sweet video, I was hoping for the Hollywood ending...two people bond over a rescue dog and fall in love.  Doggie gets to keep them both!
I sure do wish the previous person could feel the wrath of a shovel!!!!!!
❤🙏🏼
There's nothing quite like the love of a Malinois  - love this story
Thank you kind people 😅
Animal abuse and cruelty is such a trigger for me. People who abuse or hurt animals intentionally belong in the deepest depths of hell
Its not hard to act like a decent human being. Thank you for saving that dog he deserved to live a good life.
❤❤❤
I have A Belgian Malinous, he was 2500$, so smart!!   They are great dogs!!
Hurting a dog is an act of ultimate betrayal. Our species created dogs and in doing so ingrained a natural love for humans in them with all the emotional connections that come with it. Betraying that is an act of pure villainy IMO.  We have domesticated many other animals for sure but dogs have been with us so long they know and share in our emotions, tend to always be willing to trust in us, and rely on us for help.  We must always keep them in a special place in our society.  That dog would have probably loved up to the same person who hit it with a shovel in time if it was the owner. They are that loyal.  Lets respect that and always treat them kindly.
Some humans are just so amazing they are beyond awesome!! Thank you so much for helping Danny and helping him heal and finding him a beautiful home. Awesome
Beautiful ❤ Love ❤❤
God Bless him
Hit with a shovel….. 😔
Beautiful dog and Beautiful people well done
Infinitas gracias 🙏
I don’t understand people man. Malis are faithful to death. Super emotionaloh intelligent. How could you violate that bond? Glad he’s safe and loved.
Beautiful animal. Beautiful people.
Why was he wearing a muzzle?
Beautiful creature.  Thank goodness you guys cared!😊
humans & dogs, the perfect match.
Just so beautiful!!
A lovely story.
Firm handshakes all around!!!… its really sad how our species can treat other life on this planet!… we’ve pillaged and destroyed everything we’ve encountered all throughout history.. a human that leaves another life in the condition this dog was in, has no place in our society.. imo.. animal abusers are no different than child abusers.
WowTHANK YOU FOR ALL U DO
You two should go out. (bring the dog too) 😅
Thank you for rescuing him!!!!
He's beautiful. Love how he finds sticks to play with.
protocol? wtf
countless stars of thanks
That was heartwarming the fact that he never forgot his buddy that helped to change his life.
Real recognise real
Excellent share.
God bless Henry for saving him and God bless Dennis! He’s a good boy! The very best good boy!❤️
To everyone who invested in this dog's well being, safety and happiness...  😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you, thank you, thank you all for your kindness & love!
“Nervous of the world”. Poor baby, my heart breaks for him. So glad kind hearts found him and took care of him ❤
He's a gorgeous malinios
First of all , what a brave , handsome dog ! In this day and age of one horrible thing after another throughout the entire world , this fabulous story certainly hits the 'hopeful for the future ' spot . I dont know about anyone else , but i have a complete feeling of being younger and happier when i am made aware of such a wonderful feel good factor story like this one ? To all of the kind hearted souls who made bad into good in this event , i offer my thanks and sincere gratitude to all of you .... Greetings from Scotland and wishing youall the very best !
God Bless You ❤❤❤
Thank you ❤
Thanks for helping him ❤
More loyal than trump lawyer
this is what i live for not humans
Godspeed
Malinois' are not the average dog. There are some pretty intelligent dogs out there, but Malinois', well there really isn't words to actually describe how absolutely brilliant they are. I thought my huskys we funny, she puts them to shame, lol. It's amazing t see how far he had come!!❤❤
Good work guys ❤
Beautiful dog. Beautiful happy ending. Thank you for making this big guy 😭...
What a sad but beautiful story - thank you so much for saving this beautiful boy and to his new mom loving him and believing in him - God bless you all and what an incredibly handsome boy!!!!
Sadly one little pup… one of a whole litter… people obviously who will just continue to breed. One abused mom dog breeding up to a 100 of this pure soul. He was so lucky. Imagine the rest ? Please let’s start fighting like crazy to stop these monsters who breed unloved dogs destined for abuse. Please…. No one will like you…. But just from Denise’s bloodline hundreds of his brothers in worse conditions 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I love Denny ❤him. He’s a good boy.
so heartwarming .  thankyou for rescuing him.  hes lovely.
God is love!🥰🥰😍😍😍
❤
Another fake rescue video where you beat him then "rescue" him. Sick stuff
a millon million thanks
Thank y’all so much❤️
That's a good looking dog and with someone that cares for him.
Successfully resocialising a traumatized malinois as a first time dog-owner is a formidable accomplishment. Congratulations, lucky him
I have two rescues I found in the Navajo and I took them to a friend of mine who takes hard to place animals.  After being away for three years they still remembered me and how I know this is because of the reason they were hard to place.   They will bite and have to be triple fenced for safety. They came right up to me, tails waging, and extremely happy to see me.  They are 12 and 14 yrs old and have had an excellent life.  Both were skin and bones and never had families when I found them in the desert.
I thank God for these beautiful people everyday saving and being kind to animals.  I can’t imagine the darkness in a person that would injure an innocent animal, but I hope they either change to be better or get the punishment they deserve.
Great job, everyone!!! 👏 👌✌️
What a bautiful dog!
Thank you for rescuing this sweet boy.
Of course he remembers you, you saved his life!
Just love how they love u back at the end dogs and animals are the best loyal friends..
Thank you all
Baiii dennyyyyyyy 😂
Gracias por darle tanto cariño y amor a este hermoso perrito Dios los bendiga 🙏🥰❤️
❤❤❤
I’m not crying you are!
This is an old story but a touching one.
Beautiful dog and beautiful story, thank God for the kindness of people who rescue these wonderful animals!❤❤❤
❤❤❤
That poor dog!  Thank you for helping him!
♥
The love of a dog is like nothing else!!! They are my amazing 😘
To the new dog mum - you are doing great!
Beautiful malanois It’s a man’s dog-women cannot lead this dog horry
There is NO way I can be a foster mom because I would not be able to let them go. My love for them is forever ❤.
Such a handsome boy, he def rememberd that man
Someone hit him with a shovel,  I'd really love to treat those humans how they treat animals
Parabéns !!!! Não sei como explicar direito más no olhar e expressão do cachorro parecia que ele tinha sido abandonado e ele mesmo, já tinha desistido de viver, mas o amor de vcs o reavivou de alguma forma, parabéns novamente, vcs meio que deram um novo sentido e vontade de viver pra ele, Deus abençoes vc eternamente🤙🏼✌🏼
This has,melted my heart💗💗💗
WOW, that's what happened to a malnutrition, abused dog. What an amazing turn around. He's beautiful and so happy.  He loves his owner and I love that she finds joy in seeing her dog have so much love for you.  It was a great reunion.
That man who first rescued that poor dog was the only light of care & goodness that dog may have ever seen. He knew right away who was his first savior.  Bless that man and lady who adopted him.
Another successful injured dog finding a home and family story🥲.
great rescue! the gal is overdoing it with all the apparatus on him; he doesnt need a muzzle on, even when out in public, he never showed any outright attack mode behaviour. the fact that hes a bit fear based doesnt mean he has to wear a muzzle out in public, just keep him away from scary stuff until he calms down. most dogs wearing a harness will PULL in that harness, making a walk more like a human pull sled object, not fun.
Спасибо за спасение добрые люди  У вас все получится  Удачи
😎
Cant express how much i hate the human kind when they hurt animals..
Sooo handsome. THANK u so much for loving him❤
Why are Mexicans, Central Americas, so terrible to dogs? Why do they not take care of their dogs?  So many of these rescues are from South America or Puerto Rico... what is it with Hispanics and dogs?
❤
Omg, this made me cry. Thanks everyone for helping him.
Sincerely THANKYOU
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don't give rescued dog anything to eat in case he needs anesthesia at vets cause he could inhale it.
the gooddest boy
Man, I miss my dog.
That is a dangerous dog. Be careful when he picks up those branches, not sticks, and starts swinging and throwing them. Ask me how I know lol. Awesome dog, awesome humans👍
so beautiful!
I'm not crying.. You're crying!
What a great story.
You have a person Danny 😭😭😭😭
Such a beauty
🐾🐾🌈🙏🏽🐾🐾
He’s a beauty. Thank you for saving him
they do it specifically to make a movie, they hurt animals for the movies, you help from the heart without a camera
they do it specifically to make a movie, they hurt animals for the movies, you help from the heart without a camera
These videos make me cry every time.  Happy tears. Thank you for your kindness.
That's so beautiful and special. Especially the reaction of the sweet dog, when he meet his rescuer again. You can say he loves his life saver. The way the dog is watching after the rescuer when they say goodbye again is heartwarming 🐶🐕🐾🐕‍🦺
such a good baby..
I love belgian malinois.  I've always wanted one and still do. I think that breed is good for me because they are super energetic, just like me. Can't wait till I find one.
what a beautiful animal thankyou for helping him
What a sweet dog. Incredible transformation!!  I really do hope that there is a ‘special’ place in hell for those that harm animals. 🙏
I love my rescue dog.
Thank you for being beacons of positivity.  We can’t call creatures without wings angels, so we call them friends.
Part 2 : Find the original owner, and hit him with a shovel until his legs are broken
Agradecer por siempre a estás personas de luz y empatía con  los animales, personas y todo ser vivo❤
The vet suspected someone got him with a shovel? How did she draw that conclusion? This rescue thing has gotten ridiculous. People are literally making up the most tragic story they can think of. Or just making up a story to call it a rescue. Just love your dog. Period. Sanctimonious people make me 🤢.
Bless all you good people.
...it's shameful that in a "civilized" society, ...such as we😂...we do not punish animal abuse sufficiently...but then...we do not punish child molesters sufficiently...
He started being aggressive towards people because of his owners timidness. Bad owners equal bad dogs
Be still my heart ❤️ 🐾🙏🙏🙏🙏
Debemos tratar mejor a nuestros cachorros en Mexico.
What a beautiful story!! Tears are running down my cheeks. Lovelovelove ❤❤❤❤❤
Dogs are Man's best friend and are without sin.
I'd like a few moments with the jerk who hit this dog with a shovel.  Then leave him out in a muddy field.
As it should be . Pets depend on human beings love compassion . Great job .    Thanks
Can't expect God to be kind to us when we're constantly being so unkind towards his beloved creation. It's why we're being punished.
People when they hear he was probably hit with a shovel: Angry mob noises. "Fetch the shovels!"
They are smart and they remember us, and especially how we treat them. They are love personified.
His owner needs the experience.
So we are taking on Mexico’s stray dogs too? 🤣
Dankeschön 🇦🇹❤👍🏻
Somewhere in this world is a person I'd like to kneecap with a shovel.
Denny remembered his friend's voice immediaty. Such a precious dog.
♥️🐕‍🦺
What kind of vacant reprobate would hit a dog with a shovel? DISGUSTING. I'D HIT THAT A-HOLE WITH A SHOVEL YOU F*ING BET I WOULD.
They know through your smell who you are
These kind of videos bring out tears in me every single time. Thank you!!
How I wish every human that hurts an animal would get The Very Same done to them.  Thank you earth angels for helping his helpless animal in his time of need. ❤
God bless you folks for being so kind! ❤
What a lovely dog.
The ideal that dogs instinctively think the family dynamic explains a lot to me. We don’t deserve them!
Bye Dennyyyyyy! Lol ❤❤❤❤
Please pass the Kleenex. ❤️💕🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️
Best video of the year!
This channel and its people ❤
Beautiful story ❤
Loved Denny's reaction when the guy started calling him😍🐕💓
How can humans hurt this beutiful creature, s that only ask for love and attention back.
Such a great looking boy, he's got sooo much love.
Que hermoso este perro porque lo abandonaron este animal lo usan para rescate los policia ellos da  su vida por su dueño hermso que bueno lo recataron donde estan me gustaría que mi hijo lo adoptara
Beautiful story!!❤
I have a Belgian at home I can’t ever imagine someone hurting these dogs they are such loyal and loving you guys need to charge whoever hurt him!
❤
I would sincerely enjoy doing to the person what that person did to Dennis to cause the initial back injury. God bless all who helped to rescue this handsome dog.
Oh, what a terrific story! ❤🥰
It's tough resisting to talk to dogs and cats with 2nd voice.
It gets emotional for me to see videos like this because life us hard enough for these beautiful animals without the cruelty of the dark side of humanity piling on even more. I think we could and should do so much better. Whenever we see any animal exploited, abused, or killed for our heartless, selfish whims, more and more of us need to react harshly and swiftly to it.
There's a special place in the lake of fire for people who abused the animal kingdom,

Oh my gosh,  he's such a cutie!
I will NEVER understand how anyone can hurt an animal. What a beautiful dog !  I am so glad he was rescued !
Bless him 🙏
Nice, he saved the Dog and banged the Lady. Win/Win.
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
One of the rules of first help, do not give food, or give water to drink ( in most cases). Especially when you are not sure what happend to the one in need of help. Can cause vomiting, choking, internal problems...
This is so beautiful ❤
Dear Lord take that muzzle off
YES
All of you are amazing. Especially Denny❤!
We love you too babe
What a cutie pie ❤❤❤
Beautiful boy
🐕🙏🙏👍👍👍❤❤
What a beautiful dog. If someone did hit him with a shovel, I hope life hits them between the eyes with a shovel, over and over.
I need to stop watching this channel. I all ready have too many pets.
Man I would love that dog. Fun fact, belgian Malinois is the dog breed that Navy Seals use. They are highly intelligent and athletic dogs. If you saved a Belgian, it would definitely remember you or your scent.
There must be a nobile prize for people who save animals and penalty to life to people who abuse animals
AHHHHG too SWEEEEET 🐕❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💖💖💖💖💖💖
He is a handsome boy!  You guys are awesome.
Good looking dog! I think he has a great personality. With love and patience he will learn to relax around people. I have seen it happen even if some minor management might still be necessary.
Such a beautiful dog! I love when my dogs grab a sticks bigger than them and drag it around the yard with that proud face saying, "Look at me and what I did. I couldn't imagine my life without any of my dogs! God bless you for rescuing Deny!!
Beautiful story!
Animals remember those who help them❤. A lot of people don't think they do, that they have shorter memories or some other thing, but they really do remember the ones that show them kindness! And the ones that don't...😑. I don't understand how people can do the kind of thing that was done to Dennis. It breaks my heart💔. Luckily there are more Henry's than there are bullies❤😊!
🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️
Wunderbar ❤❤
Bless anyone that helps out these heartbreakingly needy animals.❤❤❤❤👊🏻
These videos are the best.
Dennis is 😘😍💖💖💖🐾🐾🐶...
Malinois are such loyal and fluffy goofballs.. Good he got a good home
Ahhhhhh🌺
Why muzzle him?  A biter?
Thamks human angel
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awsome ❤
Thank GOD for people like you. GOD bless your kind heart toward these fury creatures.💞⚘️
Dont cry dude
why he have "DO NOT PET " on it?
Yes he definitely remember someone good in his life ❤❤❤❤
Poor precious cutie ❤❤❤❤
It bothers me that most of you people watching this video can show so much affection to this little dog, yet you have no problem eating cows meat - which has the same level of intellect.
Thanks 🙏
That lady has no business fostering a dog.
So many bad people need to leave this planet. Anyone who EVER hurts an animal or children can leave first. 🤬  Thank you for helping this sweet boy. ❤❤❤❤❤🇦🇺🦘
BS for likes
Love these guys❤❤❤❤❤
How could such a beautiful dog and an intelligent dog end up in that condition?
Awe thank u to every one that help lovely dog 👍🤗🙏💖🇬🇧
What a wonderful story and a gorgeous dog.
When people are cruel to animals, they’re basically spitting in the face of our lord. Every little act of kindness counts, and helps to make the world a better place. Much in the way of blessings and thanks to those who rescue. ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Ga-boy!!!
He has such kind eyes.
😢
I love this so much!
🥹❤️❤️❤️
Gut gemacht ! Ein wirklich hübscher Malinois !
That’s so awesome!
😃
Oh ya bastards.. ya made me tear up.
I love that you rescued him, but this need to tell a story of a dogs past is actually pathological. If you do not know the past, don't make it up to explain dog behavior, especially if you are new to rescuing dogs. It might make you feel better and bolster your need to help, but it actually just slows down the rehab of the dog, your anxiety will effect the dogs behavior. They are pack animals and you are the pack leader. You should stop sympathizing and start leading right away. Creating a fictional backstory that includes trauma that changes your attitude and create anxiety for you just makes you a less stable, less calm, less dependable pack leader and that will come out as behavioral issues with the dog. To quickly move on from a past event, stop narrating it for your friends, stop holding it preeminent in your mind, stop telling the story of the imagined trauma, stop giving it room in your head. Just be a good pack leader.
This is the saddest Dodo video ever. I absolutely love dogs and German Shepherds, especially, that this must be, is the favorite of my life. I would drive forever to rescue this amazing and beautiful dog!! wherever he is,  I love him,too,  forever. I have owned 3 German Shepherds myself and 1 Belgian Tervuren in my life and they're in my heart forever, and have Crossed the Rainbow  Bridge  years ago. God Bless your beautiful dog, forever!!
Nothing makes me happier and puts a huge smile on my face than a happy animal rescue, always be kind to animals.
What a gorgeous boy!💗
Wonderful!
Is this a Malinois?? One of the best dogs as i know!!
I was moved to tears when I watched your video. To see the state of Denny when you first found him was absolutely heartbreaking, but thanks to wonderful people like you he now has a happy life ❤️
BEAUTIFUL RESCUE STORY❤ THANK YOU❤
Beatifull love❤‍🩹❣
Who's cutting onions again?
❤
We have this GORGEOUS White female dog where I work. My team leader and a few of the workers leave food out for her to eat.Most of the time she is nervous or scared. She has been living at this plant for years. Sadly she finds Away to get in,poops, and dumos  all the garbage cans for food. The dog catchers ate always called in but she is to fast and the plant is HUGE! About a block down the road there is a HUGE park. Its Spring and Summer time right now so baseball is played Friday nigts there. I was driving by the park and ahe was in the middle of the road with traffic going both ways. I know she was going there to get food and maybe affection. She was almost getting run over so parked to the side and put my emergency blinkers on. I wasn't trying to be mean so at first I tried safely to get her come to me but would run across the road. So many people in such a hurry would no see her neither my handspointing at her. Way to many close calls. I finally just chased her back to the plant. For at least thirty minutes I stayed by the road watching for her to keep her safe. I hope I did what was right. I wasn't trying to hurt her. Just couldn't have her blood on my hands since we saw her every morning. I haven't seen her in a week since then but all the dumped trash cabs shows she is still alive.
What a wonderful dog. <3
Love it!!!!
Thanks for taking care of this guy! He was able to learn good things about humans, and we can see it does not take much to have a good relationship with our ❤ canine friends! 😊
Really wonderful!!!
Jesus, imagine getting a Malinois as your first dog...
Thank you rescuers!❤
This was an awesome video to watch! Thank you for sharing! Enjoy life Denny!!!
Does he remember you? Mate, he will never forget your smell and how happy you make him feel.
Wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful ❤😢😊🎉
Beautiful story, thanks for sharing.
How can any one hurt a animal, so glad you found him hese beautiful.💯
The weird giggling of that idiot female handler went right through me.  "Let's try to be cute and tell the guy who saved the dog's life how to behave with it!"    Jeezuss.
Thank you for your kindness and help. He is gorgeous 😍 ❤️ 💖 💕 💗
May god bless and reward you
Wow this video is so heart warming the dog really looked so sad and you can see the happiness come to life in him throughout the video thank you to the guy that saved him and thank you to the lady that adopted him as well you guys are amazing I love videos like this one
He is a very good looking dog once healthy!! Nice looking boy he is.
He looks more Anatolian color wise to me. Sweet boy
Great story, beautiful dog.
Bless Denny & his savers!! Damn this made me cry, laugh, & then just beam!!
This made me cry.  But that is ok...happy tears for Denny.  🙂
I'd have him put down. No progress made, He's aggressive towards strangers.
He remembers u & he will never ever forget u believe me. He's so thankful to u saving him. He knows what u both have done for him. He loves u both. Thank the lord for u both 🙏 ❤❤
I Love the work that you guys do on this channel but honestly this stuff "How CRUEL and InHuman "  people can be makes it really hard to watch.  Although I so profoundly happy to see these animals saved by the compassion and love that Good people have  in there hearts.
Remember people, pull out your phone, if you ever go save an animal. Then make a video to get clicks and views. Yay. That be the lesson I guess.
Yes, we need more dogs in this world and we need to spend billions rehabilitating them.  (Nevermind those human children over there.)
Bravo!!!!! Hierdie is 'n wonderlike storie. Seën en eer aan almal wat hierdie hondjie en ander gered het.
"I would just let him sniff you first" while he's proceeding to jump all over him 😂 I think he remembered as soon as he seen his saviour ❤️❤️
This is awesome
That's the most handsome branch manager I've ever seen 😍
Sorry,  Dennis. People destroy and hurt everything,  but a few good people exist
I have a malinois and they LOVE their person soooo much. I have never had 1 b4, I've had GS's but a Malinois is soooo different.  Lena will not let me out of her sight, is soooo loving, is skittish of strangers but SOOOO Smart. I love this breed and she's my 1st but not my last.
Dogs are truly mans best friend! 😊
So sad that such a wonderful dog would have to suffer so much. I also have a Mex adopted dog, she had similar problems with trust and has recovered and learned to trust again.  God bless you for all your kindness and love,  what a handsome, beautiful dog. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is beautiful
Jesus Christ I cringed so hard when she said "Dog Mom". Why couldn't she just say "dog owner" like a normal person?
Guy hurts dog with shovel then pretends to rescue it  👎👎👎👎👎👎
That is so wonderful that he rescued the dog in Mexico, and he ended up with the best Mom for him!  Love how he remember his Rescuer!  Can u say HERO!  Such a wonderful ending!!!❤❤
Renews my faith in Human kind!. Good on you guys! Made a grumpy old man cry!.. Nuff said!.
Someone hit him on the back with a shovel?????? Omg i would trade off my left arm to get a couple of rounds with those people who hurt dogs. Even with one arm i wil change their face and cut everything off from him so he wil remember the day of Hell right here on earth. I'm so glad you people safed this poor dog. He must have been in so much pain.
😭😭😭😭😭😭🐕😭😭😘😘🏠👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏💖💖❤️❤️👍👍👍
This is beautiful. Our sinful nature causes us to abuse the animal kingdom but God is counting on us to be caring and look after the animals he places on this earth. They are important
I wanted to be left alone  from u stupid zergling voltaire wurld for a little bit
They're smarter than we think. And man that dog's eyes reminds me of my dog's eyes. Go Denny! What a wonderful man btw. And great job by that lady.
God bless all the people who helped this dog recover and have a good life!!!  Sometimes I love animals more than humans...
I've been lucky to own several Belgian Malinois in my life, this is an extremely touching video.
(Let me do it for you) ITS THE DOG MEME
Awesome. Thanks.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE this rescue story.
He deserves love❤I love Belgian Malinois.
😊well done and thank you from the dog!❤
He’s a Belgian Malinois and you are an Angel
Beautiful. Just beautiful. Good work, guys. ❣❣❣
Sweet baby pooch! Good job dog mom!
From no friend to two. ♥
Beautiful dog,he,ll be your best friend forever.
May you receive back 1000 fold for your good deeds
Such a beautiful story and gorgeous ending. I hope you're both rewarded a million times over for you're love and compassion to help this gorgeous dog. 😍
Whoever had Denny/Henry before he was rescued did one of the hardest things in the world to do. They broke the spirit of a Belgian Malinois. This shows the absolute horror that this dog must have endured.  Thank you so much for helping him. I have three rescued Malinois who also suffered abuse. I don't know why anyone would do such a thing to such amazing animals.
Dennis is such a beautiful dog who got the perfect owner! I love him! 🥰
my physical therapist says that this type of dog harness restricts the natural range of motion in the shoulder.  Please do not use such harnesses.
OMG my HEART!!!!!
Pfff would love to get my hands on the "human" that hurt him like that, that poor beautiful boy, those eyes said it all. Thank you so much for being there for him !!! And no doubt he remembered you, dogs are extremely thankful and loyal, and Malinois certainly are. They are smart and very very loyal. He is so handsome and happy now !!
❤❤❤
What a beautiful heart warming story!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful
I wish the worst on people that are cruel to animals.
I can watch a kid get run over by a car but show me a video of an animal that got hurt or discovered love and i'm crying like a newborn baby
You guys are a blessing 😊
I know the Dodo has connections to help her get a real trainer and show the owner the magnitude of what this dog can do athletically. I bet he needs a more intense exercise plan.
Wonderful story ❤
This is SUCH a beautiful story!! 🫶🏻
You have a person ❤
Thank you 💔💔💔😨😪😪😱🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
my neighbour got a male belgian malinois, have chance to watch Kert grew up from tiny pup to now 3.5 years old.. love that doggo, very smart, very hyper.. i will move back to my home country later this year, appreciate the memories
Get me a name and address! I will be happy to go visit the subhuman/s who hit him!🤬
We have a whole lot of evil against animals here in the USA 🇺🇸 a lot!
Of course he remembers U why would he be running towards U
Wtf who does this to animals they can’t help them selves
Hit it with a shovel is oddly specific...
My sister adopted two malinois-podenco siblings from Spain. One of them is asquirky as Henry, the other more cautious. They are too lovely.
These stories make my daze I jus lost my senior chihuahua to age & health issues suddenly, so thx so much for helping Denny!
Thank You for Helping and caring for this doggie-- we have 3, rescues--- would have 50 , if could could afford it-- they cost 700-900 month for killer care and food/each-- they are the children , we never have-- praise God, for giving us doggies for companions and and family!!-- all the best t o all the Dog lovers- keep on keeping on
GREAT  stuff, folks!   Now all  that's missing is  to  find out  who put  him into  that position: and  send  me the  bill for  whatever it cost  to erdicate the scunbag.
God bless your sole
Thank you, bless you both.
first help people not dogs.
Awesome story awesome people
I'm not crying, y..you're crying 😢❤
Beautiful outcome..can't be doing with scummy behaviour,hurting animals..thank God for the loving kind folk of this world🌈X
That's just so beautiful ❤
As a handler of two rescued Mals, this makes me cry a little bit.  They are such strong and confident dogs normally.  With compassion, everyone wins.  He looks like a proud, strong and very happy Belgian Malinois now because of kindness and compassion.  Win <3
I prefer dogs to most or the useless eater
Handsome  boy !!! Has the Belgium Malinois look and build.   Lucky couple  to have him as part of the family  ❤😊
<3 <3 <3
I love people that love animals this much ❤
I wish these 2 could hook up  and give that doggy a happy family
People who abuse animals deserve the same punishment they don’t deserve to be in society! Thanks for rescuing him ❤
Beautiful dog and a beautiful story. Except the part of the story where he was abused. God bless you for helping this innocent animal. He needed you and you were there for him. You are beautiful people for helping him. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.🙂❤👍
They know who was good to them ❤
As long as I live I will never, ever understand animal abusers... 😮‍💨
Thank you so much for giving him his best life, I pray that whoever hurt him gets their karma.
Awesome recovery. So happy for Denny and his dog mama and his friend. I hope they stay in touch. He really needs that to help him with trusting people again.
I Love These Kinda Stories. Animals are our friends and depend on us. It's so wrong to mistreat and abuse them the way that people do.... I'm glad to see everything worked out for this beautiful dog
The new owner treats that dog like a slave. Stupid lesbo. Doesnt know how to be a owner. She needs a man husband
Does he bite?
What a wonderful  way to show rescue is so very important ❤️!
good humans doing great stuff for amazing dogs. There is hope! Yay for Denny!
If I ever saw or found the person who hit him with a shovel……he would be begging that all I would use is a shovel…..he’s a beautiful boy
God bless you and thank you for rescuing him.  How can people mistreat such awesome animal.
😂❤thank you.  Gracias. Grazies. Taken care of him all you bless all 🙌   wonderful  we happy yoo
👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I don’t think he will ever forget you.
I hope there is Karma and the scum that hurt that poor dog is now suffering in some way somewhere .  😞
Want kind of evil basted would harm a sweet dog like that !wow I'm so glad he found a sweet person who loved him into wholeness
So beautiful 😍 I love it❤
❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍🙏
Thank you both for being angels to this beautiful dog.
👏👏👏❤❤❤👍👍👍🐕☝🐕❤❤❤👍👍❤👍
He is so beautiful and all it took was someone to invest time, effort and love in him. Every dog deserves those things and a good life. Happy rest of your life Dennis.
Wish i was a super hero that found people that mistreat dogs, so i can mistreat them.
Of course he remembers you. He knows who you are and what you have done for him.
Why would you hit a dog with a shovel 😥😥
Beautiful.  Great!
Beautiful story!
Why are their so many evil heartless people in the world?  I am so glad these beautiful kind people found this sad broken dog. Animals have such an amazing capacity to forgive humans and trust them even after they have been abused by them.  Thank u to this couple for helping this beautiful dog
That was well worth the 4 mins.
❤
Beautiful
I will never understand why we have to live with such monsters. Our world would be so much better without them. I love animals very much and will always save them if I would see an animal in need. I rescue even the smallest flies from the water if I would see it drown. Everything that lives should be respected. We don't own the planet.
Dios te bendiga por ayudar y darle una oportunidad de vida digna y feliz mil bendiciones 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😊
Lovely story and bless his hero who found him in Mexico.  His life is grand now.  He's even become the Branch Manager!
Test
God Bless you people.  Peace.
Thank you
What a beautiful dog. Thank you everyone who helped in his rescue!
Heartwarming  beyond belief ! Thank you both for saving this wonderful dog.
I love you guys , hearts of gold
Cool dog 🐶
Please everyone rescue animals they need us!!
What a beautiful dog
dogs never forget very good video
Fake video. The dog didnot respond normally seeing a stranger. Which means this dog was let to suffer to create this video. Marketing strategy for raising funds may be.
Seems to be a Turkish kangal mix but a beautiful one! I don't know why people doing something?
I cried so hard!! Because I’ve rescued so Many dogs! What a beautiful success story!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
👍❤️🙏🥰💯
Its really sad that humans can be so cruel. I sit and cry seeing these. Ive owned cats and dogs all my life, im closing in on 65 so had many animals over the years, and NEVER have i or my family been cruel to any of them. Not even a raised voice. God pity the fool i ever see a using an animal,, or Child.
How people can do such awful things to animals is beyond me.  So glad that Denny was rescued and is now living his best life.  Sadly, not all cases of this kind have happy endings.  🙁
Tearsss
Very heartwarming!
It was cool until that dude did his really creepy baby talk.
I vote we hit whoever hurt him with a shovel too. See how they like it.
What an angel to have been an abused mali and not have the urge to kill everyone lucky people and very lucky dog
可愛い😍🐾😍🐾
you are awesome!!
They remember everything 😊 hit with a shovel 😢
Humans are without a doubt the worst thing on this planet 😢 no respect for mother nature and all the other living creatures we share life with…. I really try to see good in humanity but, it’s hard how can anyone hit a animal with a shovel??  (Major respect to people that do there best to protect any/all animals)
Beautiful. Denny’s story and the people who helped him makes me happy to be alive.
I will pray to GOD to increase your Life expectancy
Very nice.
i dont like humans that hit helpless animals. bless you rescuers
Only a despicable creature could do this to an animal. Unfortunately it happens often.
best story ever! 💜
I hope that someone hits the person who hit him with a shovel and hits him really hard. Just seeing him lying there in the field made me cry.
All 3 of you are awesome,God Bless!!!!
I hope this is a true story because it's just making me to sad and happy. I just can't always believe how people start with saving a dog to how well it looks. I mean who's going to get their phone out and record every detail like this. I know I wouldn't because my only thought would be to get a hurt animal to a vet not filming everything that happens along the way. To many people trying to get kick backs off you tube so what do you believe anymore.  The dog is precious and I hope it is living a good life with a great family. ♥️
🙌🙌🙄🙄👏👏👏👏👍👍
I’m Sobbing, Happy Happy Tears 💙🐾💙🐾💙
PEOPLE PLEASE STOP HURTING OUR SWEET FUR BABIES 💙🐾💙🐾💙
Thank god for rescuer's as you and loving foster homes. Such a beautiful dog. Thank you for what you all do.
Thank you very much for sharing and caring
People who can hurt a loving dog shouldn’t be around humans
I really got chocked up!  I want me a dog!
"The vet suspect somebody hit him with a shovel." Yes. That is the world we live in. 😡
This made me cry
I LOVE YOU BOTH FOR RESCUING HIM AND CHANGING HIS FROWN UPSIDE DOWN!😢😅
🐶🐾🤩💕😃😁
What a beautiful boy!! Praise God for rescuing him.
From sad to happy!❤
♥️♥️♥️
Do you remember? Well yeah they a brain
I was so glad when I saw him walk!!! 😢
Thank you for rescuing him! Omgosh..so awesome 🥰
It's really hard to sound natural when you're reading and speaking at the same time.
🖤
Belgian Malinois hold special places in my heart❤
beautiful video good man!
They are all beautiful gorgeous amazing animals.
Thank you kind loving people for rescuing this beautiful gorgeous amazing dog!🥰🐕🥰
GOD WANTS US TO PROTECT HIS ANIMALS AS WELL.❤ I'M HAPPY THE DOG HAS A LOVING HOME NOW.
What a handsome dog he became after he was healthy!
It makes me sick to my stomach that someone would do that.  God love you for saving him🙏
Beautiful pup
As soon as he locked onto him he absolutely remember that you saved his life
Aww how could anyone hurt such a beautiful dog. <3
Thanks for sharing….God bless you all for helping him….👮🏽💪🇵🇭🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🐶🐶
Good job all thank you all. May you always be blessed with the best. What you do is just a god thing to do. Maybe god failed and you did not.
My husband and I have fostered over 100 dogs with 2 foster fails. The first one came from a litter of 15 puppies found in a ditch. A few had been killed. Mine and one other had broken skulls. We think they all would have been killed if the woman who found them didn't turn around to check the ditch when she saw movement. I fostered our puppy for 3 months, then started taking her to adoption events. The volunteers said she would hide in the corner and shake until I came to get her. Finally, after several unsuccessful adoption events, one day we went to drop her off again. I looked at my husband and my eyes filled with tears. I couldn't put ger through any more. He let me keep her, but insisted that her nickname, Lumpy, become her actual name. She had a large lump on her head for several months from the skull fracture. She was always shy around strangers, but was the sweetest, most loyal dog. We lost her in 2019 after a long battle with lymphoma. This video reminded me of her. I wish Dennis and Danielle all the happiness we had with Lumpy.
Thank you for saving him!!!!
That is a Malinois…it takes an experienced handler to get a rescue Mal to that wonderful place.
Shhhh this is making my Monday better.
thuh dingo
Man, the rescuer and Denny look like twins! Seriously.
❤️😍🥰😘❤️
What a sweet face! Good boy!
Great outcome guys , Beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dios bendiga hoy y siempre a este joven por ayudar y rescatar al 🐶 gracias a ustedes el tiene otra oportunidad de vida, hogar y amor de familia 🐶👏👏
People who abuse animals are to be separated from society.
What a beauty 🥰🐶
Beautiful. To no someone  are
This video is so beautiful! But I don’t think his rescuer was “the first person to show him love” - Denny wouldn’t have let him take him and would have immediately bit his hand when he pet him as he got close.
Thank God for people like you . I am a disabled veteran . I served with k-9 scout teams after leaving the military I received a rescue dog . With work and loving care he has become my battle buddy sdi service dog love him
Such a Beautiful Boy, How in the world can people be so cruel. He got a good loving home which does my heart good!!! Bravo Bravo
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                      .,/////,./ ,/.,,

Thank You  for rescuing  Denny and giving him a loving forever home❤️🐶. Of course he remembers kindness from his rescuer💜🙏🏿.
This dog is so HANDSOM. 🤗🐶🤗🐶🤗🐶🤗
God bless you for rescuing him in the first place and God bless the Vets that treated him and God bless him with and awesome and happy and healthy life!  God bless his new MOM too!
Bless you all,for your kindness.
See what a little bit of love and care can do?
PEOPLE THAT DOES THIS TO THIER ANIMALS OR SOMEONE'S ELSE'S!!!! SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT BEHIND THE BARN WITH THE SAME SHOVEL AND TAUGHT JUST HOW MUCH IT HURTS!!! THEN ARRESTED!!!! MASSIVE FINES AND OR PRISON!!!!
Gorgeous sweet pup.
You should of adopted him
You are a true HERO.
Bruh I’m literally in tears😂😂😂😂
Wow…… I love Happy Endings…..😂
BRAVO 👏 👏 👏 ❤❤❤😊
Pet's no matter what happens to them they always give love and loyalty.
Denny got a person 😭🥹
Lovely people, wonderful soul! God bless you for saving and loving that beautiful friend. He loves you as all of us for your kindness and humanity. 👏👏👏👏
😂😂Lots of Love
❤❤❤
Im glad you keep visiting Danny he obviously adores you both
Thank you for saving him❤
God bless you guys
👏🏻🐾The Dodo always makes my day, lowers my stress & puts a smile on my face. I like how this one was honest & realistic about how Denny is still healing. Having someone far away approaching him positively seems like it would help his reactions with strangers. Like the more positive “strangers” interaction he has, the better he will be. I would have different friends not afraid of him or his potential bite approach him periodically over & over just to override what is a completely normal response after he was hurt by a human. She’s putting so much time, patience & love into his recovery, while most ppl don’t wouldn’t want to adopt a dog who needs all that. 🙏🏻💗
May the person that abused this dog get genital cancer
He is so much loved. That really warms my hard on a sad day. ❤ Thank you The Dodo for showing those amazing and touching stories.
ty for loving this baby
When I watch videos like these amazing, short stories, it brings me my faith back in humanity. Thank you.
So heartwarming! 💓💓💓
Thank goodness for those who care! Denny is such a handsome boy! I'm so glad that he was found and has a loving, forever home now! Bless you all! ❤❤❤
I miss my dog ​​that just passed away😢😭🦮
Thank you for caring.
Reaping good seeds,   in forever home ❤   God blessings to you and family.   ❤

It breaks my heart that someone would hit that beautiful angel with a shovel.

Beautiful💖💝💕❤
Beautiful ❤
What a great story.
Another good man
인간이든 짐승이든 사랑을 주는 만큼 변화된다.
The adopters have done a fantastic job of training him and getting him out of his shell
I own two rescued Malinois, the stranger reactivity is totally normal. They just need tons of contact with strangers to get rid of the sensitivity and being corrected when they misbehave. Malinois need exercise, discipline and love. They won't be the friendliest dog to strangers but they will start ignoring most people. Note: No need of strong physical corrections, your voice is usually enough.
Thank you so much for rescuing this lovely dog!!!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🌼🌼🌼🌺🌺🌺
Thank you guys soooooo much ❤❤you guys are truely hero’s 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
God bless people like you who help animals who have been hurt left neglected. It’s the worst kind of thing people do. Why I don’t know. The happy endings are so special and I wish there are lots of those❤️
There are very few things as beautiful as a playful dog with his tongue sticking out, running around.
Malinois are such smart, soulful animals. I can't imagine what kind of monster would abuse one. Happy for this beautiful boy.
this is all about selling stray dogs you idiots!
Those ears 😭
Thank you so much for helping him you are his angels your awesome love heals all God Bless.
Who the duck hits a dog with a shovel? Only a subhuman person who lacks empathy. I don’t consider human beings without empathy actual humans. I consider them to be subhuman.
Get down Denny, Bless you!🙏🏾💞
This is true sigma
What a lovely ending. With that handsome boy. And the beautiful people who care. Can never understand the evil of scum bags that can hurt innocent animal/ child etc. ❤❤❤
💙💜💙
He is gorgeous. THANK YOU FOR SAVING HIM
That was so sweet that Denny remembers him
Even dogs knew who's that nice to them, while most human bite the hand that feeds them... ironic... I've learned a lot in this life, watching the dodo reminds me about that overtime... not anti social, only social cautious 😄.
Как же так, породистые прекрасные собаки остаются на улице….😢 спасибо этому парню за помощь!❤
You can see in his eyes that he just wants someone to show him some love…and you did! He’s beautiful, great save.
I'm so glad Denny found so much love!!!
What a handsome boy!!!
There are no bad dogs and an over abundance of bad people.
So cute baby sona dog and cat good morning dear good night good evening good afternoon save animals safe animals please 🙏 💞😇🙏
You are awesome
Ohh 😮 that's so special 😢😊❤
That's a good boy right there.
This dog is something! What a doll baby!!
If you are both single please date each other.
I don’t like muzzles
They found their match 🫶🏽❤ 🐾
Thank goodness he found you guys because it is hard work ❤I wish that young man could have kept him he is obviously his dog. Shepherds are extremely loyal to their saviour, so he will always belong to that young man.
Thanks 🙏🏻❤ for saving little 🐕
not a dog. this appears to be a perfect angel baby
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This dog reminds me of a dog that I saw in a county shelter once.   He was a young adult Malinois in cage #7 & he was on his last day at a kill shelter. He was  to be euthanized the next morning.   I looked at him through the cage door sitting in the back shadows of the enclosure & proceeded to  make every dog-friendly noise I could think of to get him to approach me, so I could see him a little better.  I talked to him in my best squeaky voice & got down low in front of the enclosure so I would not threaten him.  (I'm a 6 '2" 240# male, so I know that can intimidate a dog!). He would not respond to any of my entreaties to approach me.  After five minutes, I left him and went to every dog on that double row of enclosures, but none of the other dogs offered any resistance to my calls.   Each dog had a reaction to my calls.  I returned to the dog in  #7 & tried to entice him forward.  He would not budge.  I know he heard & saw me because he turned his head to hear & see me better.  After  a few minutes, I left him again & checked on the other adoptable dogs on the other aisles in the shelter.  Every dog responded to me, some wagging their tails, some coming to their gate, some barking.  In fifteen minutes,   I returned to the dog in #7 & emplored him to approach me.  No good!  I went away for another walk around the shelter to see that cats, the other animals the impounded dogs.  It's a big shelter.  After about half an hour, I returned to #7 & gently called to the young Mal.  This time he stood up on all fours & approached the front of the cage & sat down with his right side nearest me.  Without looking at him I put my fingers through the cage & let him smell them.  After a minute of that, he shifted his weight a little & got closer to me, letting me stroke his chest & neck.  I stayed with him for about 15 minutes, talking softly, mostly nonsense, &  finally I asked him if he would like to go Home & if he liked the name Bud.  He showed very little reaction, but he wanted more touching.  I left him & went to one of the caretakers & asked him how to get #7 out of the cage.  He let Bud out with a leash on& we walked around a little.  No training was apparent.  I told the man I'll take him & I paid for his release.  He became one of the best, smartest & most capable dogs I ever had.  He was with me for almost fifteen years.  I miss him every day!   Give those special dogs an extra look when picking out a new friend. ❤🐕‍🦺🔍😎❤
Love this video! So glad this beautiful dog is safe and loved!!
Just so so so beautiful. I LOVE videos like this. God bless these 2 angels for rescuing and adopting him. Thanks
God Bless You All..🙏🏻❤️✝️🐕  Thank You Soo Much...this makes me sooo Happy! 😊👍 To see a dog, this poor dog, betrayed by some pathetic person who hurt him...hurts my heart, but, You've ALL made my heart have Faith again in GOOD, LOVING, people, as I am, and, ALL the other GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I can't Thank You Enough...let's ALL PLEASE BE KIND TO ALL ANIMALS!   And, if you see one that needs help, PLEASE STOP and HELP....it's soo important...animals ARE defenseless, and, they ALL need our LOVE and CARE.  Just be careful how you approach them, because if they have been hurt really bad, they might bite you..call a vet while you are at their side and ask them what you should do.. WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART.  GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU! ❤️🩷🧡💛💚💙🩵💜🤎🖤🩶🤍 and the Sparkling Heart 💖 for how much unconditional love and trust and devotion our animals give to us Human Beings.
I seriously love stories like this! ❤
Thank you for rescuing this beautiful dog. I had a Husky that had escaped and was beaten by people who claimed to think it was a wolf.  I can’t stand animals abusers. Thank you for being an animal lover.
Could totally write a movie based on this story. :)
You did a great job rescuing this dog and are very well meaning and kind people. But... you have not understood his behavior. You need to be a leader for this dog,  he is very insecure. Pampering him when you go out, telling others to stay away, and modifying your behavior to suit the dog's tyranny is the wrong method of training. Take your dog everywhere, use a pinch collar for control, and assert yourself to correct his behavior BEFORE he gets into it.  Turn him off before he begins. The dog has to feel confident of your leadership, in order to relax and not keep everyone at bay. His behavior does not stem from past trauma. His behavior stems from your making excuses for his conduct and not setting expectations, boundaries, and corrections.  He needs to meet other dog and be socialized, not fearful. What you are doing is wrong and reinforcing his insecurities.  Watch Caesar Millan.  Do not excite him with high pitched excited calls, that ramps him up more. Don't call. Keep it low key and be calm, let him sniff you. Correct him immediately if he misbehaves. No pets, no cuddles, no cutesy talk, just silent meeting.  Establish respect for you in the dog first. Then the cuddles can come. When you have a very high strung dog like a Malinois, do not speak excitedly or he will be keyed up even more. Keep it low key. Dogs are not kids, it's a very different psychological profile.
Beautiful…
Anything positive that you give to a dog you will get back tenfold.
My 17 y/o Belgian Malinois just passed a few months ago. They are such special special dogs!  ❤❤❤🐾🐾🐾
There's still a lot of good people in this world. Thank you for making me cry with so much happiness for Denny.
💔💔💜💜💕💕🕊🕊
Cute
Nice video 😍😍
I don't like that thing over his mouth when you have him out
❤❤❤
Thank God you showed him all the love he deserves..terrible start amazing ending❤
You have a heart of gold sir.
🥰 So Beautiful..   Bravo to you!! 👏🏽 You Rescued Denny and gave him a Second Chance At Life!!  What a success story!!  I love it!
Tears in my eyes his sooooo adorable and thankful for his rescuer
He absolutely remembers. I read somewhere they can remember previous people for like 7 or 8 yrs
What kind of monster to hurt this sweet baby.  Praises he's was rescued given love and care made me cry ❤❤so sweet. Love is all you need. Thank you for his care.
Oh no…how evil to hit him
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can't believe they gave a Belgian Malonois to an inexperienced dog person and he is wearing a muzzle.  Totally recognized the original rescuer.  No doubt about that.  Dog is no dummy.
He was kinda confused when he's walking away bidding goodbye like "Why is he not coming with us?". You could tell he wanted to have more time with his rescuer. I hope they reunite again soon!
HANDSOME BOY...
❤❤❤
Sweet. I’m glad she adopted. Reactive dogs usually get euthanized if they don’t have a home
Thanks for being heros.❤
😭😭😭😭😭
❤❤❤❤
Gorgeous malinois.  Why would anyone abuse or abandon him?
What a precious dog!!!
Thank you for your humanity.  He es a beautiful dog and deserves love, care and compassion ❤
This ended up being a beautiful story.  I was in tears at the end because of his reaction to his rescuer.
Great Rescue, people are cruel, but dog met a real human
Of course he remembers the earth angel who saved his life loved him for real !!! Denny is sooo beautiful.
Hope we can have more people like you❤❤❤❤❤
There's nothing more joyful than a life genuinely turned around. Every person and animal deserves a chance.
Just imagine being abused to the point where you could only craw across the ground, thirsty and starving and STILL being able to trust people again. Dogs are such a gift. As are people willing to give dogs in even the absolute worst circumstances a chance for a better life.
Thank you to everyone who rescues fur babies and makes sure they get healthy and find their furever homes!
He’s so beautiful
What a handsome dog and a handsome rescuer.
Lies lies lies
Oh my gosh, a shovel??? Look at his eyes, how could anyone hurt him? Well you made my cry my face off when Denny saw you & remembered you! Sweet baby. I'm so happy he is 😍 😍
😊 beautiful story.
Wtf is wrong with people? 😡
I had a Malinois just like him once. Best dog I ever met. He too would grab enormous branches, trees themselves really, and treat it like a standard stick. If friends came over to my home. I would introduce them, then tell them not to make any sudden moves for 30 minutes. If they complied, he fully accepted them. If they did make a sudden move he would stare at them hard, and the clock would start again.
😢❤
guys be very aware  and wary of people who dont like dogs. i hire and manage people and the biggest psychopaths/sociopaths ive ever hired didnt like dogs. thats the only trait ive identified they all shared.
Dogs, and animals in general have the amazing capacity to heal and learn to trust and love humans again. It deeply saddens and disturbs me to hear of their mistreatment. I am grateful for all the kind and generous people who step up and do the right thing, to offer care and safety to these innocent and trusting animals. I am so happy for Dennis and Danielle. Wishing Dennis a long happy, healthy and joyful life. He is loved.
Poor baby😢😢😢
Humans are the only animal that inflicts pain on others out of sick enjoyment. Makes you wonder sometimes
😭🥹😃🥰🙏🏽
He is adorable😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂❤love that dog. . Kindness a lot and love  !! After having a bad life . 😏💖💖💖💖
❤Thank you ❤️ Awesome human souls, you all are ❤️ poor poochy 🙏🏼😊💙💙
Nice every Day I see more people care for. The dogs  Thank your guy . God bless you ❤😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💖💖💖🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💖
Malinois are among the most misunderstood dogs in the world and yet they are one of the most loving and protective dogs of their owners EVER. I have my first Malinois and along with my Labrador I cannot choose between which is my favorite breed. And I am a LONG TIME Labrador owner! They are the perfect two dogs together. Lizzie keeps Darcy calm and Darcy keeps Lizzie active. My dog life is complete.
Fake
PURE LOVE!!!!!🐾❤️🐾
If you abuse an animal, whatever you did to that dog should be your punishment, along with jail time.
🥹
Clearly the person who hit him never has felt the love of a dog. I hope one day they will.
A true adaptation solely because of love!  Thank you for giving him a life of possibilities and purest kindness!
Those sweet and innocent eyes 😢
I love people who take care of animals "The single best human beings on the planet, rescue and take care of animals"In my mind, you are all,"the most important heros in the world!Thank you, for all your hard work and supreme compassion! Godspeed 🍀
Who would have hurt this dog? People are sh*t sometimes!😢 Thanks for helping him.😊
Dogs are the sweetest & most loyal humans don’t deserve them this breaks my heart everytime I’m glad he was found & rescued & rehabilitated those sad eyes got me 😭
He looks like a Malinois.  They are definitely “careful” about trangers.  I’ve had several and the each had this type of personality at different levels.  This breed is the kind where training has to be amazing.  I’ve never found the breed to be jumpy and excited to meet new people.  He was loving to you. It was amazing!
Saying God like cussing is offensive and devaluing, which is taking His name in vain!
All I need is a shovel and address of the loser that did this.
What a special boy❤❤❤❤
🙏🙏🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🐕🐾🎉🎉🇧🇷🇧🇷
Most likly the dog probably escaped its owner and attacked somebodys chickens and thats why he was hit with a shovel. Im not saying it was ok but thats what im guessing happened.
Bless you all!!  Special dog.  Very handsome.
Humans can be so awful.  So thankful to The Dodo and all the hero's that step up for animals.
God bless you all he's wonderful.i.hope who ever did this to him pay big time pure evil.xx❤
Seems strange that you should find a Belgian Malinois like that in Mexico.  I wonder if he was rejected from a security dog training program.  The US military pulls in these dogs for their programs in San Antonio, TX.  I believe that the military likely buys them from contractors in that area.  Many dogs are not selected, but there's no telling how much aggression training they may be subject to before that point.  Also, it's a fairly naturally protective breed and a real working dog.  Typically they need an owner that can give them a lot of training and enrichment to keep down their anxiety.   Perhaps it was purchased for private security use and somehow got into a bad situation.  Intriguing situation.
What a Wonderful Dog Story of  ❤ Love ❤.    Thanks for Sharing.  It was A Feel Good Story.  ❤️.  Blessings To All. ❣️
Was für ein toller Hund  viel Spaß noch mit ihm
非常乖巧!
Bless your hearts beautiful people who show love to animals ❤️
Life in Mexico is hard… they can’t worry about a dog..
That's awesome that guy could be Dermot Mulroney son dam he looks like him so much.... great ending....😊🌷✝️💜🙏💞
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

This was just the BEST ❤️❤️🥰❤️🥰🥰
Dennis so beautiful, I’m glad he’s doing a lot better. 👏🏼

In love 🥰🥰🥰
hit him with a shovel? ffs what is wrong with people
What fking idiot gave that dog to someone with no experience with dogs?! Wtaf is wrong with these idiots?!?!
Hermoso e inteligente, está felíz 👏👏👏🦮❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pretty sure the worst day of his life would have been the day he was broken and dumped.  What an egomaniac.
What a heartwarming reunion!!!
Denny is so cute friend 😁
How precious, Jesus bless them!🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
Its Belgian shepherd!
This is such a wonderful rescue story! And I am so glad it's a foster fail too.
He looks like a Malinoise
Handsome doggy!
To see THAT breed unable to move, speaks volumes about how rough the shape he is in really is.😢
Great, great story.
Is it just me or do Mexican dogs overwhelmingly have that coat color mixture
Trying to watch a little dodo but my dogs looking at me crazy....she gets mad if she knows I'm watching another dog lol
What a handsome boy and such a great story!!  Thank you for saving him, Henry and Danielle!!
This is priceless man.  You're a good human being.
💬🙏🏼❣️
A beautiful story of how love conquers all. Thank you all.💜💜💜
He is so stinking cute with his MASSIVE sticks.  😅😂
What an absolutely gorgeous boy Denny is!  How on earth could anyone hurt him?  Such an inspirational story, bless his rescuers and Danielle for having faith in him and restoring him to his beautiful, healthy self.  Love the part of the video when he's snuggling and has that self-satisfied content toothy grin! 🐶🐾💜
Absolutely love it beautiful thank u God bless u both
That reunion was so emotional for me. But also annoying that they didn't give the dog credit for his ability to remember his rescuer. It was so obvious.
So amazing how he remembers his rescuer even after a whole year! Omg my heart ❤
That is the most heartwarming story I have seen on your channel in a while! I'm a grown ass man and I was crying. Good Work You Guys!  ♥🐶👏
I'd like to find that idiot that hit this dog
Well Hi there precious little puppy!😊
Fanno piangere questi video. Perché li pubblicate? Per " mi piace" ( soldi). 😬😵😬😵😬😵
1:17 You can see he is so fearful, his ears are plastered back.  2:12 Foster fail!
Such a good-looking handsome boy
Whats with dogs and big sticks. My jack Russell once dragged what can only be called a half a tree home from six blocks away. Everyone who passed was laughing in enjoyment watching her
Thank you Canada
God bless Henry, Sydney and Danielle
I’m glad this was a happy ending. I just don’t get how people can treat a dog so bad. Those people are the scum of the earth.  🤬
What an absolutely beautiful dog and such a huge baby
God bless you for helping 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💋
What a wonderful happy story 👍
There are decent human beings in the world.
As a kid, we had a GSD, a retired K9 unit, bcz she was abused by her handler.
Made me cry.  We do not deserve dogs.  They are so special and .precious and humans can be so cruel and unthinking.
What a gorgeous dog. How fortunate that those who hit him with the spade didn't break his back.
Dogs remember. The moment he picked up his scent it undoubtedly triggered memory of who he was. I have seen dogs remember people they haven't seen for 8+ years. They may not at first visually recognize someone (they have crap eyesight generally compared to us), but their sense of smell is 40 to 200 times stronger than ours (depending on breed) and a person's scent is all they need to remember / recognize people.
Of course he remembered the human that showed him kindness and care. He will never forget you.
Wow! He makes you HAPPY to be alive;  he found love and comfort-🙏🏽💯🐶🏆
You are his daddy the reason why I said that is because you rescue him that horrible person that hit him with the shovel I hope someone could hit them like that so you gave him life gave him hope on top of that you gave him his soul back
This a lovely 😍 extremely dog I have one before and was my favorite angel  when she passed away was devastated 😢for me
SO beautiful!
Doesn’t Henry date another young lady that does YouTube van life videos?
somebody hit him with a shovel???  please please give me 5 minutes and a shovel with whoever that POS was.  Man I hate people.
If the guy in this thing is not married he needs to start dating Danielle. That would be so cool. If they could make it work and give Denny a family that would be great!  Cuz let's face it Danielle's is never ever going to be able to marry anybody that Denny doesn't like and it would be really just Disney perfect if his other rescuer became Danielle's husband that would be really cool.
I loved this video! I've seen lots of evidence that animals do remember pivotal events and people in their lives. Both these people are very special, as is Danny.
💖💖💖
I know what I would do  with the shovel to the person who hit him!!!
Que história linda :)
Oh bless. That was just so magical ❤
I honestly don't know how I'd cope without animals in this world.
This crazy , but I had a dream last night that I was carrying a crippled dog. Useless premonitions... anyway I think it’s awesome that you were all so kind to him.
Denny's tail said it all! He recognized you right away and wanted to show you love the way you showed him love from day one. Cried with happiness for all 3 of you!
He's so cute!
I love the irony in the footage here.  Harness says "Do not pet." *PETTING INTENSIFIES*
He's got the life that he for so long has deserved.  Thank you to the gentleman that  saved him.  He has a wonderful life now, he's loved. ♥️
Love u guys. You are amazing. Keeper going! ❤
🇧🇷👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍⚘️
A very nice ending for an abused, beautiful dog. She needs to watch some Cesar Milan videos. Nurturing insecurity instead of becoming the pack leader will never work.
Thank youuuuu ❤❤❤❤❤❤
People who help animals make this  world a much better place
That melt my heart ❤️
What a beautiful dog he turned out to be. Live long and prosper Denny!!!!❤
Thank you so much ❤ Beautiful dog soul 🙏🐾💖
💕💖💜💚🤍😍😍🙏🙏
I never expect myself to react the way I do with watching these. Bless it's heart. My heart hurts for these beautiful creatures. I could NEVER be cruel,  it's just not in me. I'm SO sorry for this. Ok, now I need to just go walk outside  for a bit. *Sighs* 😢
"He won't recognize me" I don't understand why people say that because that never happens. The animal always instantly recognizes the person and is thrilled to see them again. But people continue to believe that the animal in question won't recognize them.
Denny is such a good boy. I hope that he continues to heal and leave that other life behind him. Blessings on the people who rescued him.
I love this so much!
in tears! ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
These are holy people!
Beautiful dog.. beautiful human beings ❤
Thank you for saving him🙏❤
May GOD Continue To Bless ALL of you, and give you everything that you need ❤❤❤THANK YOU ALL FOR SAVING "BEAUTIFUL DENNIS"❤❤❤
Dammn allergies.. I'd like to use a shovel on the horrible person that hurt that beautiful dog.. im so glad he has a super loving home 🏡 and remembered his friend that saved him.. love it..thankyou for saving him. 💛💛💛💛💛💛
That is a good lookin' dog!
One of the most awesome breeds❤
This video made me cry and then my heart was lifted when he started walking and found a loving home. One more angel rescued. Bless you.❤
❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He's beautiful🥰
When he recognized his rescuer, I welled up 🥲 That was beautiful! 🩵
Спасибо добрым людям что спасли собаку. Thanks 🤝👌👍👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Busy bear 82
This made me so so happy! So much that I cried! Thank God for saviors!!! Love you Denny!!!
Beautiful dog, beautiful outcome.
what a lovely story and what a lovely dog ❤
Your videos are always heart fulfilling,  soul satisfying and inspiring.  You restore my faith in humanity.
his eyes are so lovely. thank you for rescuing him<3333
What is wrong with people who not only don't want their dogs anymore but have to break it's back too. Why not finish the job totally or let it go unhurt so at least it has a chance. This is a common thing esp in places like Greece, and surrounding countries. I am sure there are many true dog lovers as well like takis in Greece, one amazing man who never gives up on dogs, cats, goats and birds too
Such a good story
Cute as f..k! But then are'nt all dogs? (And animals overall........)
Your good people.. bless you for saving the animals 😊
Denny is a very special dog through and through
Omg! My heart actually broke when I saw how sad and heartbroken he was! To see him recover made my heart swell and I actually cried! Thank you for helping him!! ❤❤
Pretty pup!
Truly noble work.  Thank you and God bless.
:)
What a wonderful dog and what wonderful people you are for saving this dogs life and showing him love probably for the first time in his life. If there is a God i hope he blesses you.    David from England UK          I beg everyone, please be kind to animals,  they only want to be loved like the rest of us.
Damn beautiful animal! Why are we so cruel as a species :/ makes no sense to me, just takes less effort imo to be nice and kind over violent and cruel. Nice to see denny thriving in life! Best outcome for sure!
I DESPISE PEOPLE!!!!! HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD ANYONE HURT AN ANIMAL ON PURPOSE????? THIS DUSGUSTS ME!!!!! I'm elated that it turned out so wonderful,  I cried!!! We don't deserve dogs😢😭😢😥
Wow such a good looking boy! This makes me want to go look for someone to rescue. Go Dodo!
God bless you bro , for giving this dog a life he deserves ( and god bless the lady who adopted him )
That reaction right there, is what makes all that hard work of rescue so worth it
Thank you for saving Denny.
You guys are my favorite people. God bless your golden hearts. 🐶💛💛💛💛💛
How could anyone treat that face badly ❤😊
STE SKVELY STE VYNIKAJÚCI 💑💙💜 Že ste ho zachránili 🐕👦💛👏 Haf 🐕💕🌹 Haf
I don't understand if there are animals in the world that are as hideous as humans, I don't know how an innocent dog can be hurt with a knife?
Beautiful people snd handsome baby boy 😍🥰😇😊 God bless you all 🙏
My Belgian Tervuren, Luna, 17 y/o, had not eaten for about 05 days.   Seemed like ataxia, and nerve damage were affecting her.  Possibly from Bravecto.     I do not like the combined medications.    I still prefer Interceptor, heart worm prevention and the Front line for fleas and ticks.  I also suspect a neighbor poisoned her.    At the Veterinarian hospital, appointment for 1440/02:30 pm, 10 March 2023,         I had spoke, rhetoric, of I was not sure if a laboratory sample or X-rays/MRI, would change the prognosis.       I had mentioned we thought if euthanising.    The female, DVM, was very happy to  get the paper work started.      I have never been an immediate advocate of euthanisation.      I had thought, she, or any DVM, would suggest or do the diagnostic procedures.      This particular hospital, Saint Bernard Animal hospital, has always been aloof, callous, and never passed messages. Maybe once in about July 2021, since 1998.      I cannot interact, even with the kennel techs.  No emotional support, includes certain family members.  Thank you for your endeavors.
Beautiful mal
I couldn’t help but notice the harness that read “Do not pet”. I didn’t even know those harnesses existed! Kinda cool for those pups that are healing from emotional and physical abuse/trauma.  I heard Malinois dogs can be very stubborn and dangerous/territorial. I’m not sure if that’s true but someone I know has a dog who was charged by one that their neighbor let off leash for some reason.   Any thoughts? Any tips for people with Malinois to help them become better socialized with other dogs? Tips for other dog owners that are around Malinois dogs?
Of COURSE HE REMEMBERS HIM!!!HE SAT W HIM AT THE VET AND RESCUED HIM.HE WILL NEVER FORGET HIS RESCUE GUY.. NEVER!!!!❤️
Thank you to these unsung heroes. People like these make the world beautiful. So, thank you from the bottom of my heart 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🏵️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
So so beautiful thank you for saving this incredible dog!!!!!!!!
Blessed are those who help and care for God's creatures...
I love his rescuer despite his sandals!!🤣🤣
That face, he's such a Beautiful boy. I cried for him in the beginning of his journey, you can tell  people weren't very good to him. I'm so happy you rescued him and helped him recover and get adopted. Love you Denny❤❤❤
I'm so glad for you🙏❤️
Belgian Malinois.
Thank u for saving him.👏👏👏🙏
You're a good dude.
👏👏👏❤
I hate stories like this because it never give me the satisfaction of knowing that the person that hurt him in the first place is still walking around... They need to be held responsible for his injuries but at least he's safe and in a good home now.     😊❤️
Beautiful
He is so beautiful. Thank you for saving him.
That dog has such beautiful eyes.  That long stick reminds me so much of my last dog, she'd pick the longest in the woods!
He is becoming a dog when carrying his stick.
beautiful i almost cry from happieness
How can you not help those eyes ? Some (people ?)
man im so curious as to why every guy featured on dodo they sound so natural with their speech and all women sound like theyre staring at a script while they talk, its so jarring
Denny will never forget that scent, that's the greatest scent of his life.
I love dogs thanks from saving him from that beaner evil farm where they hit him in the legs
❤
The demon that hit him with a shovel deserves life in prison.
So so cool. You guys are the best
I hope whoever knows the arsehole who left this little beauty badly hurt and on his  own, tells someone so they can be prosecuted! Thank you to the lovely man who found Denny, and took him to the vet. His foster lady really is special so very glad she is now his mummy, god bless all
He's so beautiful, I love how happy and playful he is with the sticks in his mouth. I'm so glad he's been rescued and is now safe and sound ❤❤❤🐾🐾🐾
That was just a gorgeous story😢
Tears guys. Fantastic.
Cобакам могут помочь только люди.Ой, какой стал красавчик!
Those two should get together. What better story of "how I met your mother" than this?
Só pessoas com o coração do tamanho do mundo faz estas coisas parabéns 🐕🥰🥰🥰
MANY BLESSINGS TO EVERYONE!!😢❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Miracles happen with loving patience. Lovely people, beautiful Dennis
What a beautiful baby
Beautiful happy dog❤️ wonderful story
꧁GOD BLESS YOU GOD BLESS YOU GOD BLESS YOU GOD BLESS YOU!꧂
Once again.  Got me reaching for the Kleenex.  ❤
Some people are worse than animals and should not have them.  If you are human  don't use a shovel. This is just a pup and we should know better.  Glad better human found him.
I would LOVE TO BE a Dog Rescuer, but I can’t even walk, myself! Woe is me!
What a great rescue story.  He’s such a beautiful dog.  Thank God that wonderful man came to his rescue and Danielle for adopting him, along with all the veterinary workers.  Thanks, Dodo.
Denny is SO proud of his sticks! 😊
Who saves a life saves the whole world 😄🐶💖👍
Wonderful story beautiful animal friend
Yes, despite in México r new laws to animal protection, the problem IS Not Over...but thanks to all the people Who love them and rescued them, God Bless You!!!❤❤❤
Who's crying????? Um, definitely not me  Nope   Lies
This is the most heartwarming thing on Mother's Day,for crying out loud... I love it so much.
Dogs take patience and training so I was glad to see how you worked with him and thanks for being transparent about the big commitment.  He looks like an amazing dog.
Wonderful story
Thanks for the great story!   Most of what we see in the news is bad.
I know it's everywhere but it really does seem that Catholic countries exhibit more than their fair share of cruel behaviour
This REALLY made my heart do leaps of joy. What a great rescue and an amazing foster fail story! I just LOVE hearing foster fail stories! I have often entertained the idea of being a foster for our local shelter, but then I would know I could never trust anyone else with that dog. My heart couldn't take it!  My dog Bella was returned TWICE in the first 5-months of her little life. Their excuse was "she has no manners, boundaries, or self-control." When the adoption counselor told me that, I was shocked to my core. She's a PUPPY!! They aren't born with manners, boundaries, or self-control! They must be taught! So, I adopted her and told her I was the end of the line for her. She's four years old this month, and I adore her more and more each day. Did she destroy stuff? OH yeah, but stuff can be replaced over time. The love, laughter, and joy I have experienced and the love I have been able to give to this precious pup is PRICELESS. She's my baby, she's my family.
What a beautiful, intelligent and loving dog.  His first abusive owner is a total loser.
💖💖💖
Such a wonderful story! So happy for Denny❤️🐶
Dennys like wait... you're coming too right? as he leaves the park aww lol
😭
Mexico is not kind to animals, I'm glad he was rescued
Tear jerker alert! He will never forget the angel who saved him. It must be confusing to him that the species responsible for such pain and fear is the same species who saved and loves him. He doesn't know it's confusing to us humans as well. To all who love and care for animals,  thank you. ❤
Collar says "Do not pet"  Proceeds to give a heckin' good amount of pets.
We were created for dogs and dogs were created for us.
Beautiful boy! Very very very very cool!
Did Danielle say she was a first time dog owner? I was impressed with her ability to adapt quickly to it.
This channel reinvigorates my faith in humanity. Anybody that wants to spread positive energy into the world, I'd recommend volunteering at an animal shelter ❤. One of the most fulfilling things somebody can do, is finding dogs their happy homes.
My heart breaks when I hear how cruel humans can be.  Thank you for rescuing this beautiful fella.  God bless you.
He's turning around when they're leaving like "come on, aren't you going with us?"....
wow that made me cry tears of joy and love ❤🙏
Not to be rude if you were new to being a dog mom fostering a dog with issues isn’t really a good idea, glad everything turned out ok though.
Made my day!!
Makes me cry - dogs remember everyone! 💙 They’re so smart - of course he’ll always remember that kindness, his life was saved that day. 😊 I wouldn’t forget him either.
Bye from Half Earth distance Denny! I miss you. Humanity has good Ppl too. So enjoy life with the good ones
Thank you to all. He's Beautiful 😍
My heart is so full watching Dennis’ story. Bless all those who aided in his rescue and rehabilitation. You guys are awesome!
Love is the cure for EVERYTHING.
More blessings 🙏
You can learn a lot about a person’s heart by the way they treat animals
What a beautiful dog he is so playful
DOODOO
Ugh my heart
🙏🙏🙏😭🙏🙏
You are one brave awesome foster mom. A first time dog mom and you took in an injured and traumatized Malinois! Glad everything worked out. ❤️
🐶❤️👏🏻🙏🏻
Sweet baby and human!
Some people have hearts of gold....❤❤🤗👍
What a lovely, lovely story.
💜💜💜💜💜
What a beautiful story!
So much love!!
It's a heartwarming story ❤❤❤
That is the breed I have had the honor to have for 21 years so far wow I hate people who harm animals at all.GOD BLESS YOU ALL he is sweet trust me how sweeeeeeeeeeeet.
Beautiful story .  Thank you.
My uncle gave me a dog he rescued from the street 20 years ago. And I remember every time he comes to visit, our dog would just lose it's mind. It doesn't matter if our dog doesn't see him for months or even years. She has never forgotten him.
What a beautiful dog he had two people never gave up on him, this woman made this dog stronger 💪 and I think that this dog will be happy with this woman because she's a special individual and so is that God bless each and everyone of you..... this dog's journey will be a happier one.❤❤❤❤❤
Wonderful story.Thank you to his rescuer and new owner
You did a good thing, my brother.
So Beautiful to see the loving kindness
I LOVEEEEEEE THISISSSSS FUCKIINGGGG CHNANNNEEEEEEEEL UGH!!!!!!! MY EEYS ARE FULL OF TEARS LOL
Props to the new dog mom for picking up on and learning how to help Dennis with his insecurities.
every doggo knew who treats them good n bad. my baby drags me to nearly every person's house who has been friendly to her jst incase their in the garden again. thank god for doggos
It so good to see the people who saved his life in many ways.
Tears of joy ❤
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
THANK YOU!! This made my day!!❤️🙏
Necessary to muzzle a dog when aggressive however this dog is NOT
Thank you for respecting his life 💜
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊thank you so much for helping this poor Danny ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What an absolutely beautiful face he has. Thank you for helping him. Son of a B. I am not a fan of humans to begin with. And these abuse stories do not help. I wish the damn law would make strong animal abuse laws. Like a huge fine, maybe jail time. And never being able to own another animal, not even a rat.
What an awesome recovery and amazing new life.
Amazing people saving animals that's what it's all about. Thank you so much for doing that.❤❤❤❤
THANK YOU FOR SAVING THIS BEAUTIFUL DOG 🐕.  MAY GOD BLESS YOU 🙌.  SO BEAUTIFUL  HAPPY DOG  ALL THEY NEED IS LOVE, CARE, HOME, FOOD WATER N TREATS, THEY DON'T ASK FOR MUCH.......❤😊
How wonderful!
I'm trying to figure out how such an expensive breed ended up abandoned. Makes you wonder if he was protecting his person when he got hurt. Thank you for helping him, he's beautiful. ❤️
you know the character of a human when you see how they treat animals.     i am convinced of it.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
why would anyone hit a dog with a shovel..
Beautiful,  The Bible teaches that we are to love and respect Animals Genesis 24:19
I'm not crying. This is just too beautiful.
That woman definitely reading off a page.
My goodness, he wanted you to go home with him!!💖💖💖💖💖💖
i wish all animals got help like this :(  the people involved need many years in prison :(
Love you
What a beautiful dog how could anyone be so cruel, so glad he is recovering and is now well loved and cared for, happy tears🥲 glad Denny recognised the wonderful man who saved him, heroes both of them 🥰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
Our Best friends since long time, able to learn wide variety of tasks, good at reading people, yet many of us treat them poorly? Glad to be subscribed this channel, maybe we're salvagable!
Poor puppers.  😳💔 So glad that these kind people rescued him from a terrible fate.  👍😊 There are good people in this world...despite the terrible humans that are in it.  Thank you for sharing this video with us.  👍🇨🇦😊
Thank you! You are a blessing to all. ❤puppy love is the best
I HATE ANIMAL ABUSERS 🤨🤔😤🤬💯
Los perritos conocen a las personas que los ayudan y lesdan mucho amor 😍 está bien agradecido ❤❤❤❤❤
❤️  thank you for such a beautiful share!
Angels walk the earth…you all are the proof! Thank You for helping him…and God bless you. Keep up the good work! (All four of you!)

You wonderful man, wonderful foster fail Mama and beautiful boy. Thank you so much for rescuing Denny he is so loving and happy now. 🙏🏼🐾
Another life-affirming story of love, hope and triumph over adversity from The Dodo! 😊❤️🐶
People that abuse animals are sick people. Please go away forever
❤❤❤
Hit with a shovel?!😮 WTH is wrong with people?!?😮😮
Great story. thanks for this
I bet you you they put that dog there 😉 for the video.  To show it's been rescued after 😋😁
Dennis, you all- - thank you for saving him..He is a beautiful boy, so wonderful!
How do you say"man's Best friend"in spanish? Cause it's so nice seeing some animal love from the mostly cold and distant humanity that two language barely cut it for me. Tell if you agree!
What a handsome boy. Thank you to the folks who gave him a better second chapter to his life. For real
Great, great story! Go Denny!!!❤
Sharky🦈🖐️.... Thank you for saving that lovely dog, a fine example of humanity that is needed around the world.God Bless.👍🤗🐕💓🙉🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Cool guy.
Henry, Sidney, Danielle....awesome people who did not hesitate to save and love this dog. He looks beautiful and happy. Thank you Henry for walking in that muddy field to get Dany out of his misery! Great job everybody and Danielle got the biggest prize: to keep Dany.
It’s great see the fear and pain that’s so evident in his eyes at the start fall away. This dog has every reason to hate people but recognizes love when it’s exhibited.
Thank you for saving this beautiful soul. ❤️🌹💋
He is a beautiful handsome boy.❤❤
I'm crying. How is it possible that he had to suffer so much before he found love. To all the people in the world who rescue and love animals: Thank you!
💕🇿🇦
Most animals think in pictures only, and not in language. It does not make their memories weaker than ours, just different.
I’m 70 and I want a dog badly but I would have to give up my holidays abroad.  I had a dog but it died.  I love dogs so much
BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤😊😊😊
Shame he couldn’t stay with the guy who rescued him
I'm not crying 😂
Thank you so much.
I don't believe in heaven or hell.  But, if I'm wrong these two people deserve to be in the VIP, first class section of heaven for all eternity when their journey is over.
Such a cool rehabilitation.  And the joy on his face seeing his rescue. Prof  dogs rember everything which is good
He found him like that "in Mexico." That's of no suprise. Thanks to the kind man who obviously isn't from there.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Only humans forget what other humans helped in the past
🌷🌷🌷🌷🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This guy is just a great human being!
I am so happy you were saved Denny!  Thank you to all who helped you!
Thank you for the rescue! What a beautiful animal! Dennis is a gorgeous Malignois. I don’t know if I could let him go! 🐾♥️🐾
a rollercoaster of emotions
A dog's heart never forgets. 😢😢😢
God bless these incredible people. The doggy is absolutely precious. Animals are God’s angels.
Heartwarming but I think that guy is who should be taking care of him. The life you save, you become responsible for.
The person/s who did this to him will get Karma... 👌
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Of the millions of species of animal on this planet, the human race is both, by far, the worst AND the best!
My buddy Denny is a lot like this one abused by people his whole life but still managing to be a good dude amazing work
its always kinda sad how quickly dogs start to trust people after being literally physically abused. but thank god for the most part those dogs get a loving owner and protector
Your foster-fail is your greatest triumph. He's amazing!! And so are you both.
Well done young man....welldone !
He's beautiful! You guys rock!
Saving a life is great feeling!
Gracias ❤️🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹
❤❤❤
How could you not keep a dog you’ve gone through so much with? Unless you couldn’t financially make it work. Especially one so handsome & smart!
❤❤❤❤ Thank you for all those wonderful  and lovely rescuers also worldwide! 🙏❤️
Thank you to all involved ❤
Thanks 😊 😢😮 so much God bless you 🙏
Malinois?
I’m 25 seconds in and I’m bawling. We lost our two German sheps and my heart breaks for him. So glad he’s safe and happy now. Thank you!
I am soooo glad to see Denny walking around with a muzzle. Here in NYC people have dogs they think are reactive, and instead of putting a muzzle on them and proceeding to help them gain confidence and have positive experiences until they’re better, people instead use *only* avoidance for the rest of the dog’s life. The humans make the dog cross the street whenever any dog or person is approaching, which not only doesn’t rehabilitate the dog, but actually reinforces the dog’s impression that other people or other dogs are dangerous enemies to be avoided. The dog starts off fearful, then is taught that it’s human is *also* fearful, so it will be even more aggressive to protect the human who clearly doesn’t want anyone approaching. Complete avoidance of everyone is no way for a dog to live, especially in a dense city.
Such a touching story and a beautiful doggo!  He’s happy and blessed and he absolutely remembers the man that saved his life!  I’m so happy he has a forever home, because he has a lot of love to give.
*Every person has a distinct smell,  & dogs remember that.*
I ᖇEᗰEᗰᗷEᖇ YOᑌ

There are beautiful souls left in this world, ❤

Go Dennis!!!
ကုသပေးသောသင်၏ကျန်းမာရေပိုပီးကောင်ပါစေ
Looks like a Malinois
Cried again.. So cool.
Heartwarming. Thanks to all who put in the effort to save this boy’s life.
What a sweet gorgeous boy. Thank you for saving him.🐶
Hit him with a SHOVEL?! I hope that whoever did that suffers for the rest of their life.
Man, being helpless must be hard for any dog, but a Malinois? I can't imagine what he must have felt like.
😢😢
Such a beautiful dog ❤ I am so grateful that yall took care of him and that he found his forever loving home 🏡 ❤
His mission in life is to find the biggest stick he can possibly carry.😂 Sha baby boy.
Thank you to all the rescuers. I can barely look at an injured animal, let alone do anything to help it. I will never understand how some people can be so cruel to animals. People who rescue animals are a rare breed. I am awed by you.
All heroes❣️❤️❣️
Bless you and all of you who gave this beautiful second chance to Deny...
the only news I need <3
This is awesome
Was hit with a shovel, God I hate humans sometimes.
This guy is silly
See how evil some people are hitting him with a shovel why I’d like to hit them with a shovel!! Thanks to the good people for helping him
Poor baby.😢💚
Beautiful boy ❤️❤️
HAPPY BLESSED MOTHERS DAY❤❤❤
Wait, a new dog mom and you took a Belgian Malinois??? Those are for experienced owners/handlers.
I always cry at these.  Bless you ❤️❤️
Poor Denny!  That's so horrible what (we suspect) happened to him and so wonderful that he was rescued!  The adopter is doing an excellent job of training him and letting him come out of his shell.  Seeing him reunite with his original rescuer is sooo heartwarming!  Denny is living his best life now.  ❤
I would have absolutely 💯 percent wanted him!! He's gorgeous and an incredibly intelligent breed, with a lot of love, he will continue to thrive!❤❤❤❤
❤❤🐾🐾🐕🐕🐕🐕❤❤🍀🍀🌞🌞😊😊
What absolute monsters could hurt this poor baby 😢. My heart breaks for all abused animals. I'm so happy Dennis is happy and loved ❤
Beautiful
I cant believe someone would do that. That is an amazing bree of dog
This is the stuff i love waking up to.
Hermoso simplemente y muy bendecido, gracias humanos por haberlo ayudado. Bendiciones para ustedes too. Amén. Gloria a Dios. 👼🏻🙏🏻👼🏻🇨🇴❤️🇨🇴
Amazing what Kindness can do ❤
Such a sweet dog. God bless you all for rescuing him❤
❤️❤️❤️
Oh my gosh the girl that adopted  him - is laying down a list of rules the guy that rescued him has to follow - just to say hi, he ever has to ask her if he can say the dogs name 🙄 She also had read her lines for her little segment. Oh my gosh this doggy got adopted by a serious Karen.  The dog wanted the original rescuer to rescue him a second time.
Yup, he absolutely remembered.  Dogs don’t forget kindness.
Who's a good boy!?!?!?!!!!
Thank you sir
Dogs will always remember ❤ so sweet. Such a beautiful dog, and glad he’s in a happy home!
Thank you for rescuing him. God bless you!!
He had such sad eyes. 🌷💚🙃
He's sweet
Easily the best video of the day.....I am happy for them...😊😊😊
What's the prison time for beating to death a person with their own shovel????
Kind Sir... The question was never does he remember you? the question was always how could he ever forget you?❤‍🩹
❤ ❤ ❤
Thank you for saving this sweet dog.
🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤
❤❤
These people are such beautiful inside and out. Shout out to Denny💪
So beautiful guys!!!!❤❤❤
This one is just ADORABLE!!!!
How could anyone not melt to those eyes and big smile?!! Great story!
What a beautiful dog!!! A huge thank you to all of you for giving this darling a second chance at life!!!
Why somebody hit him with a shovel is beyond me. That monster deserve a shovel in the face. tsk tsk
Dodo best channel of human and pet's bonding dogs even after 10 years will remember his human friend
Gorgeous boy!!Thank god for these people!
cute
This is what a wonderful life is about, loving and caring about each other 🥰. Have a blessed day everyone ❤️🤗♥️!
❤Big hugs to you all
With gratitude... For saving this precious... Creature of love
Mexico is not a good place for a stray anything, let alone a dog. So glad Dennys life has changed
Omg - awesome!  Thank you for saving him. You have such a kind, loving spirit and no doubt Denny could sense that and knew he could trust you. ❤❤ very handsome too 😊
Bless you for rescuing this beautiful boy and not giving up on him❤❤😊
I can remember myself when i saw a stray like this on the street who couldnt walk, Bless this man ❤❤❤
Beautiful ❤
He's so sweet 🥰
"We assume someone hit him with a Shovel"  *John Wick Mode intensifys*
"the lasting effects of his previous life started top show" NO just stop there! NO! He got agressive against others because you didn't take a leadership role and became the alpha of the flock. Thats why he is aggressive towards others to protect you. Dogs don't care about the past the ONLY live in the present and anyone who says otherswise is delusional and don't know how a dogs brain work. The leader of the pack WALKS FIRST and commands a leader presents will be respected the first time you tell. But if your dog walks in front of you and doesn't obey commands it knows all the time then you are NOT the leader of the pack plain and simple.
Rescue dogs that turn in to stick dogs is something that will always make me smile.
❤
He was right to trust you and for your kindness he will forever have a bond with you!!! ❤ thank you
Truly BEAUTIFUL.
❤❤❤
❤👍❤️
ईश्वर आपको आपके काम के लिये ढेर सारी आशीष दें ।
The face of the dog is so telling. I am so happy he got the use of his legs again.
Sorry but I don't think he is a reactive do.. almost guarantee he is reactive do to the energy his new owner puts out.. when she see people she put out the energy OMG how will denny react.. people think animals don't respond to energy they .. if he was reactive it wouldn't have mattered if it was 6 months or a year he would have displayed Reactivity when he initially reunited with his rescuer and didnt
Happy family for ever

John 3:16 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Romans 3:10-12 King James Version 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. 12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  Luke 13:3 [3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  John 14:6 [6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Jeremiah 29:13 King James Version 13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.   John 8:31-32 King James Version 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; 32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.   John 8:12 [12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.   Matthew 4:17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.   Luke 6:27-38 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,  6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.  6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.  6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.  Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  Matthew 24:4-14  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   Exodus 20 King James Version 20 And God spake all these words, saying,  2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;  6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.  7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:  10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:  11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.  13 Thou shalt not kill.  14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  15 Thou shalt not steal.  16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.  17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.    ..,..,..,..,..  ..,..,..,..,.. ............. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, .,,........,,. ,.,..
