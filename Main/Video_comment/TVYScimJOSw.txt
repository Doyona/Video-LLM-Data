Can someone explain to me why a billionaire or a consortium of billionaires would buy Man United for 4-6 billion and spend another 10-12 billion to make it great? What is the incentive if they don’t make Return of Investment? Is it an asset to show off or an uncorrelated asset to sell later at a higher price?
I am Indian and would be gutted if Ambani takes over LFC. I was hoping he goes for Utd. If he goes in to LFC we are gonna have a huge fight on our hands ....he is obsessed with winning whatever he gets into.
ManU has been sold to Primark.
why was these parasites allowed to buy club on debt placed on the club now they looking at 8 bill profit ,never should been allowed to buy club in 1st place.
Some that wants this great club to be a top force in the EPL again simple
Thank Ronaldo for glazers out
This man is so deluded in soooo many ways, Ps love how frequently he changes his opinion maybe more often than I change my socks
to all the Indians shitting on ambani dont forget the internet u r using at a privelege/reasonable price it was him who revolutnised the mobile services in India which was once exploited by those services by charging higher rates
You are assuming, assumptions doesn't make it fact.
Fact: man united go up for sale after CR7 interview
Man Utd needs a new stadium. England's 2028 Euros bid doesn't even include Old Trafford. It's an embarrassment and a liability these days.
No Ambani please
Funny mark is like I wouldn't be surprised if a  class of 92 member is part of it , yes mark you won't be surprised because the papers told you this morning 😂😂😂😂
If Ambani buys Man United then the same thing will happen with him as what is happening with Qatar by hosting world cup.
Have you guys looked at Bayern Muenchen organizational model?
frankly i dont want Sir Jim, rather i wish we have someone like the ambani's as owners who are successful and knows how to bring in success. Sir Jim has been a bad owner so far for Nice
Showing your true colours Mark!! Utd do not need Fantasy football owners!¡!!!
You can be sure whatever this guy predicts won't happen , hes just a mouthpiece ,the same guy who went  on about frenkie de jong all summer
Don't want middle east owners. Oil and gas is going down and will continue to.
More yanks will buy it maybe worse than Glazers!  As for the Arabs history America exercutes a lot more people than Saudi even women and people with mental health issues. The Saudi's have never bothered the geordies and perhaps learnt a few things.
Ambani will take every peny...he will do penitration marketing like he did in jio. Good luck united rotten club🤣🤣🤣
If ambani takes evem some shares of united...cr7 is already right n he will be more right
Ambani will be grt for united, he will take more than glazers. We indians know🤣🤣🤣
Will whoever buys united fix the holes in the roof, sort out the rodent infestation and buy some big screen TVs?
Mark. I thought you were intelligent and experienced regarding football. It’s disappointing to hear you repeatedly state that Ronaldo’s interview had nothing to do with this final straw that broke the camel’s back. Ronaldo‘s voice is powerful; he’s a celebrity that people consider to be the best ever. For heaven’s sake the man has the most Instagram followers in the world. Once he came out and announced his anger and disapproval regarding certain things at the club, do you not realize how many people at that point was being made aware of certain things for the first time? Do you not also realize how many people who were already aware of ALL the details (from the outdated kitchen to the sagging infrastructure), were now going to take it more seriously? Do you not realize how and why owners of any business would take advantage of this public awareness to announce the investment/buying opportunity in order to reach the biggest audience?
Man said guitar haha
bring in ELON maybe he would release the deadwood at UNITED needed this for many years!!
Musk would be the best owner.   Elon is a G.
Nah mark you’re having a laugh Ronaldo was the nail in the coffin
We will never be at the very top ever again. Football has changed. To do so, the club would’ve to build everything from the ground up while other clubs wait around for them.
sell it to the fans
Here to watch the video because of Mukesh Ambani in the Thumbnail. I wish he buys it! Mumbai Indians is handled very well. 🇮🇳
Barney the dinosaur would be better than the Glazer's tbh
Someone who is loaded who will spend it 😂😂
find it crazy that people seem to think you can be a billionaire and hold the moral high ground. Anyone that rich was either born into it or fucked multiple people over to get their wealth. any new owner is going to have a bad history. its just the nature of capitalism.
So let me get this straight. The Glazers rebuked the Sheikh back in 2008 because they didn't want to sell. They rebuked the Saudi Royal Family's enquiry regarding the club's sale because they were "here for the long haul". Only to put the club up for sale less a year later. We would've been the richest club in the world with the richest owners but missed a massive opportunity and have now gained another direct rival. Well done Glazers...inept, clueless pr-ats...
I don't think the timing of the Ronald interview and the club being put up for sale is a coincidence, so thank you Ronaldo!
The Fans and Ronaldo pushed the Glazers over the edge. With Team Viewer demanding to pull out of their $235 million 5 year deal. Was the last straw
Mukesh Ambani is great candidate to take ownership of Manchester united ❤️
Lot of people don't want indian owners because they are jealous. After ruling indians now it's thr time to rule you pûßßies.
I hope I am wrong may be this is a stunt from glaziers  knowing they are being pressured to sign since Ronaldo left   negotiate with new owners till transfer windows go by  while still getting dividends as owners
So basically what You want is a owner who just put cash in the Club. And dont care about business because United has best supporters in the world. Dude You dont have a ounce of idea How economics works😂😂😂
4:30 running twitter in the ground 🤣 didn't know having over million new users means that.
Musk is a must lol
If the glazers leave, it will only be down for one and only one reason. Their  own incompetence
Ronaldo putting pressure 🤣😂😂 my opinion, Fight yourself about it.
God please give me 200 billion, so that I can buy Man United for 10 billion, build a stadium and training complex that nobody has ever seen before in this earth and rest for squad, salary and maintenance for many years.
I am hoping that Sir Jim buy's our club
Let's hope and pray that the potential new owners will not be of Glazers type!
Sir Jim is not wealthy enough the owner must have north of 20 billion to compete now.  I would accept Sir Jim and the wealthiest person in Netherlands.  If it must be Americans I would only accept the Walton family although I’m sure they’re no better than the Glazers.
I want Saudis or Qataris to buy Man Utd or Jim Ratcliff. Ambani can't stand with them.
Roy Keane will buy and first act will be to revoke fergies ticket till he apologizes 🤣🤣 Most of the Chelsea terms were set by abromovic so the club wasn't hollowed out the womens team the training grounds and the charity he set a standard all had to adhere to
Only if Elon Musk want to buy us
Anyone but Qatar. They've obviously got a thing for football.
Ambani would actually be good. Can't believe I am saying this; I hate Mumbai Indians almost as much i hate arsenal. But the amount of football development he has done for his city ,Mumbai it's really astonishing.
Glazers selling to an owner who wants to make it the best will highlight how bad the glazers are.  That's my concern
Elon Musk used the same debt-ridden strategy to buy Twitter that the Glazers did to buy ManUtd.
Seems to me like most utd fans would drop their pants for anyone who has the cash to buy us irrespective of where the cash comes from...
Don't care who buys Man U as long they have ambition to win trophies and Don't take the fans as fools Glazers out GGMU
What an incredibly cowardly stance: "Other people have amoral owners so why shouldn't we?"
Ambani is really closely associated  with the government  in India if they topple ambani has a lot of scams under his name and it will be publicised  and it will be the same situation as roman at chelsea he doesn't even care for his own brother let alone the club he is buying will probably  look at it as a profit or a loss kind of guy he has to stay away from our club
Mike Ashley did this for years to take the heat off him and make it so he didn't have to buy in the transfer windows...how confident are we that this isn't just a distraction stunt?
I want the richest possible owner who can compete with Newcastle and City and will not want a cent back from the club.
'The similarities are similar' very wise words mark
Investment corporation of Dubai. Networth 305billion.
I hope the glazers don’t go, best owners ever
Indian PM now Indian Owner.
Jim Ratcliffe alone can't afford the club it would swallow his whole net worth within a few years the initial purchase alone would cut his net worth in half, we need someone with hundreds of billions not 13.5 billion.
I want Arabs to buy United💯❤️❤️
Some fans are thanking Ronaldo for pressing the Glazers to sell.The Glazer's will have known for a long time,honestly a long time that they intend to sell this football club.It's now been  made public but if you are the Glazer's you don't wake up one day and say let's sell Manchester United,it just doesn't happen like that.
Mark I been saying AMBANI in your chat for years people just don't get how powerful India has become. Every Country is trading with them..
Just want owners who care bout club and want club to be successful
I been saying for years AMBANI.. Even if its GAUTAM ADANI bring it on.
If ppl say it wasn’t cr7 then why did they leave when he had the interview
Marks starting to piss me off, Ronaldo was a big impact on why glazers are selling now
I think its good but only if we get someone in who has a english football brain no more American owners
i bet they’re just gonna take the highest bid but we need someone who will do their due diligence and find the right director of football and higher ups to run the club. also it helps if they pay off the debt.
finally some good news as long as glazers r gone!!!ggmu lets go!!!
got glazers 2.0 written all over it be sold to somebody they know and they will still have control by proxy what a way to appease the fans and still have a say
I.m so Happy… cos were gonna get our football club Back… just hope its for the good of our Beloved club and not just for profit 👹👹👹👹
Whoever buys utd will be billionaires. You don't become a billionaire by being nice, so they will all have issues for fans to argue about.
Mark you should have bought Manchester United instead the studio.
Ronaldo will be back at United after the Dubai bought United from Glazers...😅
Ambani is one of the most corrupt people in India - we'd be selling the soul of our club again
What about the one point six billion debt.where does that go?it ain't gonna disappear down some black hole.
Considering Ambani is around 90 billion worth and has experience of running football league in India, him being in race can be a plus.  Also, he doesn't like to lose. His cricket club franchise is very successful so they do know thing or two about running sports clubs.
Ambani could be the best thing happening to united by miles he is better than anybody literally anybody in the world. As a businessman as a human we Indians consider him as the  second most respected  businessman only after Ratan tata.
Mukesh Ambani
It was the ripple effect @Mark . Ronaldo just gassed it up to push it faster.
Do you want to have a moral high ground or titles?
Give credit where it’s due, you knew nothing of a sale prior to any part of the interview was released. It’s called a domino effect
Trump in, MUGA!
They will change stadium name
Saudi Prince if you want to compete with man City....and now Newcastle unfortunately that's just the only way we get a new stadium as well
Sir Jim if I could choose but someone like Man City and Newcastle. End of the day "beggers can't be choosers"
Either Knighton or Radcliffe
Donald Trump a winner with Sir Alex Fergusons attitude  !
Not sure UAE ownership can be classed as morally dubious, it’s a much more cosmopolitan country than the rest of the gulf, I’d take anyone over the Glazers
Glazers out
Guitar 🎸?
I don't care who buys us just as long as they have utds best interest at heart
happiness is warm gun
Viva Ronaldo glazers out
Glazers have made the right decision sell the club for the better of the future, and with us on transition it's food time to sell
I feel like if we do get an owner thats wants to be the best that they almost certainly will want to bulldoze OT and make a better stadium. Wonder how that will go down
Ronaldo, Beckham and Ratcliffe to buy.
Ambani should be the man.. the way they built Mumbai Indians team was incredible..
Elon Musk is asset rich not cash rich
For all their controversies Man City and Newcastle are performing  very well as a club, so I’m impressed with what the Saudi investment has done for them
Ambani are massive
Also clean sweep board
WE are the only people in a position to scrutinise the scrutineers, Fans are in control now surely, the motivation & clubs future well-being are intertwined. 🔴❤️ Glazers Out.
Really doesn't matter as long as they invest & put us on right track. & Dont sack Tenhag for at least rest of season. Or further.
Bet we don't spend big in January now
I honestly can't stand any American fakeness near the club. I would be happy with any other nationality that has the clubs best interests at heart ♥
they may not sell yet
Mark the way you're speaking is totally wrong. How can someone worship football?  Football is only fun to watch but it's not religion.
Elon musk let's go!!!
Cristiano ronaldo was main influence to sell united bro..
Mark I’m from South Africa why ain’t you broadcasting in the new studios
Black Friday Sale
They used Ronaldo for their last chance of salvaging a few quid before selling. Mark has recently became a bit of a Diva.
The investment was a smoke screen so they don't get a crap deal.  It makes business sense to say we're looking for investment rather than we're having a fire sale
Bigger than the World Cup. Sheesh
Spiffing show, old bean!
Dnt care who the owner will be as long as they have great ambition, football wise
Just a few months earlier Sir Jim Ratcliffe said in his interview that the Glazers told him United wasn't for sale. Who lied?
Ronaldo’s ego is so big he probably thinks he is the reason. People who think that he is the reason they have no clue how the economy works.
We don’t want ambani he is a fraud Indian people suffer while he rocks a roll Royce no thanks
SO RONALDO HAS DONE A GOOD JOB, WHY CRITICIZING HIM THEN ???
Idiot who said a middle eastern oligarch is the same as a billionaire from the US or UK, it's not. You're clearly not thinking. A UK billionaire has never invaded anyone. It was the government. The oligarchs in the middle east are fucking royals. They do have a say in the human rights abuses.
Watch what you say Mark. You will have to make an hour long apology and do a interview on how not be that.
Its like Glazers holding Manchester United hostage.
Until they take out dividends, then it's Ambani Out or Sir Jim must jump off a Cliff  🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
the best owners are the arabs
as an Indian i hope Mukesh Ambani buys it rather than Arabs. Indian subcontinent have passionate fans but Arab doesnt.
Beckham is likely to be a figurehead for a bid.
Jim Radcliffe won’t personally buy United it would be done as INEOS to add to their sports portfolio
Ambani is the guy who actually commercialized the football scene in India and made the game more viable to the public!! Ambani actually is helping Indian football to go up now than before which was just played among a very less audience! I support this man to take over United as I know that he wants success as much as profit! He will make success and profit both together!
The fans scared off sponsors as well.
MuskChester United!!
I hope Ambani buys Liverpool , Man United are too entitled and would need more work.
From old Trafford to new Delhi 🤞🤞🤞
Don't remember ronaldo say he is responsible for glazers selling the fans said that them selves so how is it being disrespectful
It was all because of Ronaldo , it’s no coincidence.
Pls no more American owners they have no idea whatsoever about English football. We need decent owners who care about and want to invest in this club, we don't need another lot of Americans draining us dry
I put credit on Cristiano Ronaldo
Ronaldo is the future and the present
Morals 😂. United is owned by the glazers.
RICH ARABS PLEASE
Ambani way to go
We need to be careful what we wish for here. I'm hoping of course it's someone who has on the pitch football interests at heart rather than just for profit.
I think it's going to be dubai they seem to be favourites
Rothschild being the glazers  financial advisers 👀 it's a rich man's game
Love the superchat  how is.musk running twitter in the ground  🤣
CR7 wasn’t the reason the Glazers are selling, but I do think he caused their intent to sell to be made public much sooner than they probably wanted to.
Oh the US owners have better morals than the middle east! Please!
you dont become a billionaire being ethical 😂 don't be naive
Ambani is best for the club . They have a cricket franchise and runs a football league in India . Never shys to take big decision .
Don’t mind who it is as long as they ain’t as bad as the glazers, don’t sack ETH and treat us as a football team so we can get back to where we were
Well I will say goodbye, was only here because of Ronaldo, sayonara Man united fans and good luck!
As shady as Ambani might be, putting all that aside, he really knows how to manage a sports franchise. His company (reliance foundations) founded the Indian Super league (India's PL equivalent) and he also bought the streaming rights for the WC in India (jio Cinema).
Don’t get picky now. The Glazers are going apparently which is all we all wanted
No doubt Ambani 🎉 Mumbai Indians is the best team in IPL and they are the owners of MI
Black Friday sale at Utd 😜
Not heard from Knighton for a couple of months
When you gonna say thanks to Cristiano 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Ambani is very inteligent.  Meaning he's gonna buy a liverpool (good team) or go man city way.  Buy for less n invest.  But hope adani don't buy united because he's gonna make united bankrupt.   As a Indian i think Radcliffe is the best.
Ask the glazer who they want to sell not the fans LMFAO
Ronaldo is not the only reason but his interview has had some impact dont lie to yourself mate
Ambani's will be great owner but I don't think they will buy man u i just don't think they want to if they did it will be very exciting because this guy can make anything workable
Anyone but fucking Ken Griffin and his dodgy hedge fund friends.
We need to be debt free
DUBAI ARE BUYING MAN-UTD.👍
Im worry about a mega billionaire ego maniac is that they try to run every aspect of the club like at psg or chelsea.
I think I would want someone who will help get back the club back to the top where it should be
Anyone but State-owned (e.g. Newcastle) or Americans
Disagree totally 100% Ronaldo speaks out and everyone listened ..we been protesting 17 yrs .. whether you like it or not the Ronaldo interview has been a big last boot put in ..sponsers listened to that interview to ...very Very daming yes they wanted investment but now they want out ..they told sir Jim not selling afew wks ago .
Glazers had the World Cup as a pre-decided date to put the club on the market for a long time as they know how many Middle Eastern and American billionaire eyes will be on football right now. Selling a multibillion£ football club is not an overnight decision nor process. Ronaldo leaving at same time is purely coincidence
ambani's wife literally started the indian super league in india  his circket team are the most successful team in the ipl as well
They are selling because they have wrung out every penny they can. The well is dry, that is the reason.
Whoever buys us I hope they don't do a Boehly and get an itchy trigger finger so Ten Hag can have a good go as manager
Fire the TikTok and Instagram admin 😅
i dont mind who the owners area slong as they sack all the idiots than run ManU atm not our manager ofcourse
It will be nice though... with new ownership maybe we can win the epl
It’s not a cheat code when you’ve made the history to get yourself at the top and build a brand only for others to cheat their way at the top. DUBAI PLEASE!
Everything is about 💸. Has long the new owners invest in the Club and get things back on track. I will be happy with that ☺️.
UK or European based fans don't quite understand what an Ambani ownership is like.They are monster mentality owners,their setup at Mumbai Indians is a kind of which every cricketer wants to be involved with.They just don't own IPL franchise but many different teams.Also great promotors of football as sport in India since ISL launch.
We will be shouting ambani out soon
Although I’m loving the fact United are potentially up for sale. Having the glazers orchestrate the deal worries me. I feel it’s only to benefit them and how much they can get and sell to their mates just to be in the same situation all over again. Let’s wait and see
I’d sell United to Old Nick as long as he’s a Red Devil! Let’s not talk about human rights issues in the Middle East although they’re disgustingly wrong. Let’s look at what Britain and the USA have done around the world in the last 200 yrs, that’s also disgustingly wrong. Love United, hate Glazers!
Ronaldo is not solely responsible but he is one of the reasons for what he said about the club and facilities. When legend like ronaldo speaks against the club facilities and how it is being managed then it is worrying for owners. The ronaldo situation should be the last nail in the coffin. The way it is all handled has broken hearts of man utd fans.
10bn! Twitter is 100 times bigger than united but sold for 44bn. 🙂
hopefully not Indian owners
Cricket people does not understand Football, would love to have Football people buying Man United, American owners out
Elon Musk?😄😄
I’m with Liverpool fans. I don’t want stupidly rich or Arab owners. It’s ruining sport and I don’t like how easily you can just buy the best. Man U have been about recognising talent and making a great squad rather than buying big name. That’s why I respect Klopp as a manager
"As Picasso said, you've to destroy it to rebuild it... and if they start with me, for me, it's not a problem". Cristiano Ronaldo. In my opinion Ronaldo sped up the process, a player of that magnitude solidifying the statement of no change in facilities for over 20 years really put Glazers under even more pressure.
Man UTD Christmas Sale 😄😄😄
Your wrong as always mark Ronaldo has a lot to do with it you always think you are Wright but your not
well at last Man Utd can breathe
Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Foundations also founded India's current premier football competition , The Indian Super League. If he is investing in MUFC, it means he understands what it will take to run the club. The man practically runs an entire competition in India.
The Glazers would have taken in to account the lost revenue from the ronaldo situation and may have been a final nail in the coffin don't forget Ronaldo wanted to leave in August. This also means the Glazers won't spend a penny now no signing in January
Please excuse my ignorance..if an owner  can't take dividends..what  financial  benefit  do they have?..investment  for a future  sale?
jack ma..... now he's mostly retired, maybe it's time to get his billions to work......
They guy moved a coke can and devalued that brand.  If you think someone with 500 million followers had no influence on this...
It’s a build up cr7 finishEd them offf
A filthy rich billionaire who backs a world class manager, invests in the club, revamps Old Trafford and leaves transfers to experienced director of football and scouts. Is that asking too much
Whatever happens I hope there won't be an MU jersey with Amazon written on it. ( Napoli can screw themselves )
Radcliffe is a great option, I want an individual who supports the club and cares. I do not want a consortium, I want us to be ran like a club and not a business
We need to be different to man City and Newcastle morals should still matter its Man united our morals should be brought back time for fans to make a stand
I want Dubai ! They will make us GREAT AGAIN and will put the right people on the board to ensure that.
get chinese in ....
“12 billion is needed” Do you know how much a billion is?! Mark please get someone who understand maths and business to speak on this because you’re talking nonsense
Ambani is fine but I believe he will not have enough understanding to handle mufc..India is Cricket feed country mostly loving cricket with bcci earnings 2x more then Icc. Football is not gonna work.
Elon Reeve Musk
Dont care who buys us now as long as long as they invest in everything we need, team stadium, training ground, decent board who want utd to be successful no matter what!
JR would probably  be our best an safest bet, going by the love he has for the club GGMU ❤️🤍🖤
Some accounting information. The debt will not be cleared. The net assets will be purchased, i.e. the shares. This will not influence the debt. The buyer will carry the debt. Also, there has been talk about why the Glazer's don't sell players. The accrual principle means if you pay 80m or 10m for Maguire, he is worth 80 mil or 10 mil in the books as an asset. The leverage ratio = debt divided by equity, so the higher the assets, the better the ratio, so, not selling AWB or Maguire improves their debt interest.
Imagine the chicanery if Ronaldo bought Man Utd
You would not want Indian owners. They are tightfisted prats.
Glazers out!!! 😊😊😊
The person who is passionate about football and winning ,,must buy Manchester United other then that all will be same as glazers
You don't understand the Indian market. If Ambani buys United then Indian sponsors will line up with a fat check. United will open more stores in India than uk. So much cash flow will get in that Ambani won't take anything less than best.
Ambani would be a fantastic owner. His Mumbai IPL team priorities top level scouting and having fans at the centre of the club.
Ambani would straight away get United Competing for the league plus Ambanis do always share a good relation with match officials.
For goodness sake! You completely miss the point. No one is saying the Ron interview caused this! What we are saying is it is no coincidence that the sale announcement follows on so close to his interview. Yes, they may well have been planning for sometime. But, it is the timing of the announcement. Why do you call all fans who do not say it as you "idiots?" We too love United...not just you Mark
Team Viewer wanted out. Once Ronaldo was out
CR7 is our savior. He got the Glazer to sell!!!
If you think Ronaldo is not responsible for the sale then you thick!!!😂
Once it’s not American owners, we’re good. We need owners from Asia, Europe.
I mean Elon Musk joked about  buying the club back in August.... Imagine 🤑
Emirati group would be good. Imagine a manU jersey with fly Emirates
Can we just ban Americans from buying any more British clubs!! There have wrecked enough of our clubs!!!
Don’t want dubious owners but be sponsored by Nike and adidas 😂😂
If Mukesh Ambani group gets  the club he will definitely get things very much better with a clear path. But just don't expect anyone to match the spending power of state owned clubs.
Cristiano did this .
Nope, just listening
The problem with wealthy people....they are impatient. ETH will be fired.if the results are not good.
No oil Bois please 🤣
Give me a Saudi I don’t care anymore
the big rumour is sold by christmas
As long as its someone who buys players for the club to be successful and updates OT and Carrington I don't care if its an Eskimo from Alaska just be the right person to take United forward
They said consider  I believe investment is what they want  Don’t trust the glazers
I find the ownership rhetoric hypocritical now, a lot of these conglomerates in india/America have dubious moral issues. We would end up with no owner at this rate
I think I’m the only one that wants Dubai to buy us. But having said that, at the level we’re gonna be sold for I don’t think anyone will expect any kind of profit from the club. I mean you could leave 6 billion in a bank and make far more profit just from the interest payments then you would from owning man United
We got glazer out... We got glazer out.. Greedy glazet.. We got glazer out...
Most likely to be Dubai owners, Glazers wouldn’t sell to an English because he might make the Glazers look terrible. Ambani is too controversial, because United heading to another owner who knows little about football.
Who we want and who we get could be miles apart. Whoever it is needs to invest BIG TIME. Cristiano called it out, so IF he influenced the Glazers selling up, goon on him
So RONALDO WAS RIGHT. Let's get this out of the system hey! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ambani is a great owner to have. He has left no stone unturned at Mumbai Indians.
As an Indian I can understand putting Mukesh Ambani in thumbnail is hilarious 😂
Jim radcliffe
Elon musk needs to pull through 😂
i don't care who buys aslong as they invest obviously sir jim would be first choice
Mr Mukesh Ambani won't ever buy at the valuation Glazers are asking for.
new owner new manager????? like Newcastle?
Mukesh Ambani is one of the most successful owners of IPL teams, Mumbai Indians. He used a turnaround strategy while his team was not performing well during the early IPL years. That’s the major reason why Mukesh Ambani would be a perfect owner to bring back the structure in place.
We need Dubai owners that are financially strong like City, Newcastle and Psg if we are going to overtake those clubs and become better than Madrid
New Glazers?
I'm afraid.. I won't be comfortable until the glazers are gone, but even then we could end up with the same trash or even worse...
As much as I would love to hear someday that Mr. Ambani is the new owner of MUFC, I would rather prefer an english owner of MUFC, who really understands worth of Man Utd  for England fans and English FA.
Id take anyone that wants the best for the club thats whats needed
I'd have dubai. Their royal family is worth 150 billion.
Don't want any Arabs!! I'll walk away!! Chinese not much better but maybe another big American!! Difficult one!!!
Sir Jim Radcliffe is ideal
That interview really made an impact.
No one has anything to say?
Ronaldo is bigger then united
