I am truly honoured to collab with you Julen🥹 what a wonderful process, video, experience, and end result nail polish collection💅 you do be bringing the vibes and I cannot thank you enough✅✅✅
Omg what a chaotic Aries energy in the end 😂😂
Hows Jenna
Dude.. from jenna 2010 to julen 2024. Im just crying. Im so proud and its clear we all are and i know jenna is proud! Just ugh FEELS. 🎉🎉🎉
Omg the hair 👎
I read "magical hostage" instead of "magical mustache" for the brown nail polish and now I'm a little disappointed 💀
Yooooyou need the drip dry drops from OPI or Morgan brand i belive has one aswell. Game changer!! Plus it conditions the cuticles so its a nice finishing touch :) Makes such a difference.
Bro go back to jujitsu
YouTube didn’t deserve Jenna and Julien. They were too sweet and wholesome. They needed to be protected at all costs and we ruined it.
Our great grandfathers, dying in WW2 to protect the world from evil. Men in 2023, “let me show you my nail polish!” 🤮  “Hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men.”
The chaos energy of Julien brings me so much joy. Thank you sir for being as you are.
Why does he look like he's coming straight outta a Electric Callboy musicvideo? :')
I wonder if you'd like the UV gel because its SO FAST and lasts longer without chipping! <3 I haven't been able to go back since
They have the same chaotic energy 😭
He looks Australian ❤and hot❤
I really vibe with your editing style. Your vibe is felt thru the vid.
I am so glad you made this video! I always thought I would never be able to do my nails because I have short nails and it would look weird, but the way you do this, talk about it and how you generally approach the subject; makes me feel like I too can wear nail polish one day. That it isn't about having long nails or just one nail colour. Its to be expressive and loud, or subtle if thats what you want. Genuinly happy this video exist. I'll definitely rewatch if I ever feel sad <3
you shuld have nails and long ones for a video and do stuff like play games make food etc
“I don’t know what your doing but Stop” 🤣😂 that gave Jenna energy
Julien looks like a young, alternative Marc Maron.
That kitchen is unnecessarily HUGE. I personally perfer a cozy kitchen to cook in.
she really felt like what living with julian is like
Is he gay now am confused what happened?
I miss Jenna!!
I love how expressive you are. You are unapologetically yourself and it’s beautiful
Juliooooliooooo. Can we go back to the man bun…z.
Happy birthday it’s my birthday today aswell April 17th
Bro where did he go?😢
I miss julen vlogs :c
We have the same name
I wish you and Jenna still making videos. There was and never will be anybody on YouTube like your wife and you were a formidable force also. I gotta tell you out of all the wacky hair styles you've had, this one has got to be the worst. Ya, I still love you and miss you.❤
His wedding ring makes me so happy.
When I’m going through ptsd or panic attacks I try to look for details. I can look around my room and see nothing but if I focus on details, like fur of my cats or the details of a video, it helps bring me out of the flash back. Jenna and Julian do that for me with no effort on my part. I don’t have to concentrate to see the details in things. Jennas and Juliens. Voice/videos immediately ring me out of it And I will love you guys until the end because of that. I will keep rewatching videos because of that. I love you guys with all my hearts. Thank you and all I hope for y’all is that y’all have a happy life with no struggle. Love you more than you know.
Why I am i surprised there isn’t a yellow 😂
You know he had to do it to em  Congrats Julien 🎉 This looks sick!  Hope Jenna and the doggos are all well ❤
Is je na every coming back and when are you going to do some new videos
Julien, I think you would really suit a Trilby hat (possibly the slightly shorter peak favoured by Frank Sinatra. And maybe a nice sports jacket. I'm channelling the classic Hollywood 1940s style (think: James Stewart). This would involve painting your nails with a clear varnish rather than a colour. Keep up the great vids, anyway, they are very entertaining.
Hey Julien! I’m so grateful you’ve kept making videos and letting us even a little into your life (because you didn’t have to!) and congratulations on your collab!   If you ever make anymore Aries’ Kitchen would you consider attempting a vegan baklava? It’s one of my favourites and I just can’t seem to find any since going vegan.   No pressure at all, and I hope you and yours are happy and healthy!
Thank you for being awesome
Miss you posting on this channel 😢 love the collection though, it’s gorgeous!
Shave your face, get your normal hair.
Thank you. Thank you and Jenna. I wish you safety and forever love and best of health for you two, family, dogs, anyone and everyone. Friends. I personally love you guys from the internet. Thank for making the YouTube so wonderful. Goodbye. :)
Random but I sincerely hope that the reason Jenna left YouTube is because of a spiritual awakening. I feel as though she was on her way to understanding the world for what it is etc. 🙏❤️
How's Kermit?
I’m so happy for you! I’m crying because I’m happy but it’s cause I’m having period lady emotions. 😂
I'm really sorry about the recent incident affecting you Jenna your furry babies, and your lovely home! I hope you all still feel safe and your life is yours! Sending love.
Why is the combo a look. I’m sorry julien but I was judging and now I’m judging myself. I like all of them now that i see the combo
for all of you people who are against men painting their nails...you DO know a LOT of "feminine" things now were originally meant for men? skirts, heels, makeup, PINK, wigs, and i'm sure much more. so who cares if a man paints his nails? is it hurting you personally? does a man with painted nails take ANYTHING away from you? no? then what's the issue lmao
Julien is definitely better in applying nail polish than I am!
thankfully this guy decided to stop turning men into women by uploading these ridiculous videos
the wolverine pose is actually a vision! imagine it being professionally shot, you have pointy extensions on and each fingernail is between 2 bottles. so cool!
HEY JULIEN CAN YOU PLEASE TELL JENNA MARBLES TO MAKE VIDEOS AGAIN!? SHE LITERALLY GOT ME THROUGH THE DEPRESSION OF MY BREAKUP FROM MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL BF AND I WAS IN BED FOR W MONTH LITERALLY WATCHING HER VIDEOS ALL DAY EVERYDAY! Fucking Black Lives Matter ruined her videos and I can be openly honest about it because I know she cares about black people but they found horrible example ways thinking she doesn’t but she does. Sigh and I’m NATIVE. Maybe I should say NATIVE LIVES MATTER ! Hopefully the president will approve of and will make it as small and important as Black Lives Matter was
A straight guy talking about painting his nails and actually painting them. Why? Why? Why? Is it common among straight men in the us? It’s something a guy’s ass can be beaten in Russia. I am sorry, I don’t judge. I am just a little confused.
“Jennas Channel” did she come back to YouTube?
my dad was the replacement for the guy who got fired at 24:08
Congratulations on the marriage!!! I miss seeing Jenna on YouTube. She got me through some rough days 💜. Hoping you guys continue having a beautiful life together.
My dream (and I’m sure yours too) has come true, you two are my favorite people and I shed a tear when I found out. I hope this happily ever after lives on forever, you two finally being married has truly made my life. Thank you beautiful people for all you do/did for us, these videos truly got a lot of us through tough times and I will be forever greatful.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND JENNA OMG YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT AT YOUR WEDDING :(((((
King behavior 👑 having hobbies has nothing to do with one's gender, hobbies are not for any one specific gender. Anyone who thinks otherwise is only missing out on the fun things they won't do because it's not "the gender norm". Periodt.
Have you heard the song Remiwolf by Guerilla? Because they stole your AYE BEP BEP BEP. But I now love the song because it reminds me of you and your ariesness hehe.
Where has he gone? :-(
O
Strictly an #ad
I miss Jenna a lot...
The contained Julien chaos has me dying 😂
I just need to know if the dogs are ok
very gay and feminine. what a shame.
Bro I’ve been watching juliens twitch for a hot min but I never put together that the Jenna he talked about WAS JENNA EFFING MARBLES
Always dink fam ❤️
I wish we could have Jenna back in the fold. But I wish more so that she is loving life and being Awesome like always. We miss you Jenna ❤❤❤
I don’t know if it’s the screen I’m watching on or just how nail polish is but it seems like the colors look different in the bottle than on your nails?
Miss you guysssssssssss
Why does that look like a tattoo of dahmer on his arm??
Happy Thanksgiving to Everyone ❤️
Cool, congrats Julie! Oh, and I miss Jenna so much it hurts. ❤ Love from Sweden
Julieeeeeeen🎉 beech a beautuber beech 🤩🤩 so happy for you 🥹
I want that polish
Hey ! I just realised how tattooed you have become! Cool! If you ever come to Bergen, Norway,  I'd lo e to have you come visit our cozy little tattoo shop at Bryggen
As much as Julien is still good by himself im videos - I really do miss Jenna  I hope she really knows that. The internet and the trolls & stupid history police suck for whatever theyve done to Jenna.  Poop
Throw me like a grenade into the Grand Canyon.
Jenna I love you I hope you reading it 😢❤please come back we needs your videos more than ever
Julian please come back
Oh my gosh are they married now!? I know they got engaged but are they now married now!?! 😭❤️
Is Marble still alive????
miss you❤
Let's goooo
Fuck ya Julin!! 💅 ♈️
Did Jenna stop uploading because she got sick of it/bored of trying to come up with a video every week? She was great and so successful I don't get it
putting your fingers in cold water dry's your nails polish  faster🤓
Jenna we miss you :(
julien look like a new up n coming pop artist
I expected some lemon yellow (Julien yellow) but these shades are really nice, too
Ur not even cute tho
Jesus loves you!!!
Ok I’m getting Jeramy Gritter vibes from the Voidz
Miss you Jenna
I paint my elbows and the head of my dick. Any questions?
julien is just like the cool dad of YouTube
its been awhile since ive been here and my god, ur looking strange. when the bi or gay coming out thing gona happen?
Man I tried to go to the site to get your nail polish and it's not there anymore 😒 darn it that sucks
Now I really wanna paint my nails!
I remember when goth kids painted their nails black and was ruthless bullied constantly now "Influencers" do it and it's fab and cool...
First jenna and now julien? 😢😢 My favourite youtubers all slowly disappeared. It really feels like the end of a great era
I am 💀 at the aries-loud mullet. You go, Julien!
First of all I love this whole set. And also as a pro tip: it’s easier to paint from pinkies to thumbs. Way less possible smudging 🙃
#bringjennaback 😩
Jk
Where did you go
?
HELLO!
so you're only going to make a video when you have something to sell us?
I miss Jenna 😭
JULIE, where'd you go??
WHY IS HE WEARING A WEDDING BAND
How are you and Jenna doing??? It's been a minute so wanted to check on you guys! ❤️
It might sound really weird and stupid but I really never thought that I’d miss Jenna Marbles THIS bad. I found her videos when I was in middle school and I’m 26 with my own family now and I something’s think about her videos. It be cool if she was still around but I understand. 🖤
Just over here thinkin about marbles (mubuls*). Hope you and Jenna and doggies are doing great
I'm sorry that this comment isn't about the video, but can someone tell me if Mr. Marbles is okay? I was thinking about that little man and his lil cute tongue sticking out. I hope him and all the other pups are doing well 💕
But where is Jenna tho
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU JULIEN
I can't find a newer non stream so I'll say it here. A few videos ago, you were showing off your plants and you gave me the courage to buy a monstera. I said if it dies it's all your fault.  Welp it's been over a month and it's growing new leaves. I can't believe this happened. I bought one before and it almost immediately died.   For any other plant killers out there who wanna try it. I got a monstera adansonii from a brand called leaf joy. It comes in a glass jar and all you need to do is dump out the water and refill it once a week. I'm using tap water.   I can't fricken believe it's still alive. Thanks Julien.
The http doesn't work states it isn't found
Can we have a dog update? How is marbles doing?
Love this! Even though I enjoy your stuff, please give Jenna a HUGE hug from us. We miss her so much and hope she's doing well <3
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JENNA MARBLES, I still watch your videos every morning getting ready, I love that you’re a ✨36 year old laaaddyyy✨ now, I hope you’re thriving love you
Happy Birthday Jenna Bean. We love you
Where have you gone julien??? Tell Jenna she’s still missed.  Hope you guys are good
Your nails are already nice without the color on them! Still learning how to do my own and your cuticles look healthy af.
Hello. Super glad you’re well. Just watch old clips of Jenna and you and I realized how good of a role model your guys relationship was for me during my formative years. My partner and I treat each other how you guys do each other. Love to see you’re both doing well, and I’m really happy to hear about that rescue you guys are doing for all the pups. I usually don’t do these weird para social relationship comments sorry about this y’all won’t even see it but if I could give back even an ounce of the positivity y’all brought to my life it’s so worth it bro <3
I hope that someday I can have a fraction of the confidence that Julien has
doggy update?
Nail polish…
When you miss regular vids from him and Jenna 😔😢
TELL JENNA I MISS HER SO MUCH SHE IS THE BADDEST BADDIE TO EVER BADDIE. The OG drunk tutorialist. The OG dog mom. The OG of everything
So happy for you! All the shades look great 🔥
So you're gay
Jenn! Hop you are all doing great❤🙏🏽 miss her video days🙏🏽❤🙏🏽
I want the Here You Grow as a poster or a tshirt design tbh
THAT IS MY LITERAL FAVORITE SHADE OF GREEN OMG IT’S SO HARD TO FINDDD 😍
You’re so dope ❤️ Keep doing what you love and sharing your art!
So yeah no
I love the monstera
My life is boring without Jenna i can't take this anymore😭😭 But im also happy for her doing what she needs.
Why isn't it available anymore 😢
Did he and Jenna get married????
videos went from good to cringe real fast
Is marbles still alive?!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
So feminine
link is broken?
As a straight guy I've thought about painting my nails a ton of times but always decided not to because of societal norms but I saw this video and finally decided "f*ck societal norms - I want to do it - I like how it looks" and today I went to work for the very first time with painted nails and it felt AMAZING.   I know he'll never see this but thank you @julien for giving this guy the confidence to be who the fuck he is and not be ashamed of it. Love you brother.
Oh damn...now I want her to make a box of chocolates pack
I wish my boyfriend expressed his personality through his clothes/ nails
Will we ever get a life update from Jenna? I miss her so much
Im not liking the vibe of this lady… is it just me
Hello
I'm sad I missed this because this is the coolest thing ever I'm legit jealous. So I'll just be using my boring ol' Revlon nail polish to paint along with Julen today
Omg his haircut makes him look like joe exotic!! Lmao
But doesn’t the skittles package show the colors you get?
Can we please have a dog update soon, it would be nice to see mango, Mr marbles, bunny and cement again :)
Haven't seen you in years. Julien, you look like you're trying way too hard to take on an identity that doesn't fit. It makes sense considering all the rushed tattoos, the try hard haircut, and painting your nails and general tool appearance. Clearly you became addicted to attention while being with Jenna. Your appearance screams NOTICE ME and it's getting worse by the year.
Since when did your make your arms look like an 8th grade binder? Come on, you can do better.
How did you go from so hot to looking like you are going through a crisis?
Not the mullet!
Thankyooou so much for your videos, Julien. I am so inspired by your content. You were actually the reason to start my own channel and trust in the power of being yourself. All the Best for you, the Jenna and the whole gang !! xx
am i the only one that got super excited when seeing the title hoping jenna’s coming back
Julen- you are the dopest shit. I can’t even figure out how to paint my nails as a lady (huge lesbian who plays guitar and also designs and decorates cake for a living [also my nails are man smarties and I don’t see the point]). Also, please confer to you future and/or current wife that I totally respect her decision to stop posting but she is desperately missed. One of my fav videos she posted was her plant hoard.
I miss Jenna
God he got so fucking cringe and tryhard. Since he lives in LA he had to go full-blown  far left cringe.
I hope jennas doing okay too :(
Please let Jenna know she totally lit up so many peoples lives and she continues to with her data left on her channel, I’ve lost my pop to covid, my best friend who was tragically pregnant, all in 6 months, now I have covid, feeling miserable and shit, watching her and you makes me laugh and reminds me life isn’t so horrible, and to be grateful with what you have, I will continue to laugh and be strong 💪 I believe that is the right way to be x
maybe the next set should be a fast-drying formula for you!!
I hope you and Jenna have a great basketball game tomorrow 💜
WHY DOES JULIEN SOLOMITA LOOK LIKE GABBIE HANNA?
Where are you? We are missing you.
Can you come back and do a video with the nail polish as MOK? mock?  I forgot how to spell the characters name.
okay if the dogs were a color (not their fur just their personality) what color would each one be
So what you're taking me is they aren't quick dry.. 🤣
Dude, wth. No.
I love Jules but I miss seein Jenna so much! I miss them together. Even tho she would NOT agree w this lol...I just want to beat the ever lovin FVCK out of the MINISCULE amount of ppl that TRIED to go after Jenna to "cancel" her. (Even tho it didn't work & ppl just came for them) but I wish they could be exposed on a list lol.
Love you julen however I want Jenna back 🥲 please come back Jenna.. just make a vid saying “got youuu” cuz this has to be a joke 😂
Yep I'll buy it.
Oh look, gender envy!
How is Jenna doing?
Julienuh, your mullet is SLAPPING!
It's been a while since I've watched you dawg! Love it.
I have had issues with my nails being too short for nail polish to ever look good on them, but this really makes me wanna get some polish on them 👏👏👏
Juli turning into the badass Ken doll ❤️
Always the 80s daddy
wow, besides the grey, these are my normal colours that i hardly ever differ from. add to cart!
aaa a useless collab. that is what we need in life. how lame
Good lord that hand tattoo is so ass
So he's finally coming out gay after he ruined his girlfriend's career!!!
damn wheres my body builder that evolves into this beautiful human bean
I need julien to upload a video of him just fucking around with jujitsu but no audio, just "glimpse of us" as background music lmao
OMG so excited for you and your new product line! So happy for you and Jenna as well!
You should of did this as maq
I’m crying. Julien I’m so happy for you!
Hey you’re a cool person Julien, really love the vibe you put out and how you express yourself here with sincere and quality content. 💯
I miss Jenna :(
I never wear greens but Monstera went directly on my fingernails and toenails when I received my box - and my 13 year old stole it to use it on their nails too. I love the entire aesthetic of this collab. Holo is the best - can't wait to mix and match my other HT with this collection :)
Waiting for nails to dry sucks for EVERYONE. Def not a skill women possess either Julien lol 😆 Just gotta ask some chicks 🐥 for their own tricks/hacks. I tend to paint my nails before bed. May sound like a bad idea, but works for me. Takes about 24 hours for a TRUE dry.  PS. ❤️ Miss you Jenna xoxo ❤️
i dropped a whole box of holo taco polish last week.... but! the only nail polish to break was an old top coat from a drug store brand 😅
He’s a 10 but can’t tell the difference between Sandra bullock, Julia Robert’s and Anne Hathaway🙃
Eh
jus noticed your ratty Betty rings!!! love love love
THE BEPS GOT ME PUMPED
If my boyfriend wore nail polish; I'd have questions lol
SLAYYYY
IM SO PROUD OF YOU CANT WAIT TO BUY
I got into painting my nails as a femme with Simply and Julen has played a big part in feeling comfy painting my nails now that I’m more masc and this collab bringing both of them together just makes me so happy. 💅🏻💗
I've been a fan of Jenna and Julien for years, and I've been away living under a rock apparently! I didn't know they were engaged! I haven't happy cried in a long time :D
This gave me all the warm fuzzy feelings ❤ congrats on your collab!!
We love you julien and we miss Jenna. Can she make a guest appearance? Her videos kept me going through rough times in my life. I hope she knows how much we love her! Congrats on your collab and love the colors!
Those shades are absolutely wonderful great job
the video you shared is great, it's a pleasure to connect with you, wish you happiness and success 💖💖💖
I think men would be able to feel a lot better about themselves if they were openly able to express themself like Julien through nails, or light makeup, or fashion or anything like that. It just sucks how misogynistic society is where stuff like that is seen as "girly"
I absolutely HATE HIS HAIR
I still miss jenna so much... I can only imagine she helped paint his nails behind scenes... 😍
IM LITERALLY SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS
Julien, you are cool
You look like Gabbie Hanna
Let's live our life..loudly. Thankyou for such a beautiful life motto. 👾❤️
I bought the set as soon as I could, and let me tell you. SO GOOD. Absolutely love every one!
That blue 😍😍😍😍
Omggggg plz plz plz do more cooking vids
I love these colors!!! If you're a big nail polish collector you'll know that sometimes it's hard to find a nice forest green and medium brown like that!!! Plus thar powder blue, purple, and gray are absolutely GORGEOUS 😍
Julien ending up being the beautuber is just *chef's* *kiss* !
Please please please bring Jenna back we all miss her! I hate how she felt she "offended" Somebody we all need her content again we miss her!!!!
Wait did anyone notice that he pronounces his name as Jule-in?! Have we all be mispronouncing it wrong this whole time? 🤯
Great news 👏 👍 🙌 😀
I love this!!!!!! Please drop some bowling shirts I will buy literally 18
Three things, first, so proud of you, Julen! Second, the purple looks a different color in the bottle, than on your finger, at first. Is it somewhat sheer, or is that just because it's wet? How many coats for it? Just the two? Third, the brown seems out of place, thematically, but from a practical standpoint, you picked a pretty good palette, because you can use brown in a lot of ways. Also, once it's on the fingers, it somehow works with the others. Such an Aries move, but it's genius! There are other things I wanna say. But, this has been a long enough comment lol.
holy shit I haven't watched any videos of this dude in a long time.. Did you get into a fight with a printer and lose?
Happy for you, but I miss Jenna life's not the same without her :(
these shades are so you, and your humor is unmatched as usual <3
Is Marbles still with us?
You've got to try her quick dry top coat! It will save you some drying time!  I do love the collab but I'm so happy that you were her 1st collab! I've heard nothing but good things about you the deserving people being recognized.
My daughter bought some from Julian,we live in Sydney Australia, its really nice nail polish ,I like them too,we both like to have different colours on our nails
Is the “here you grow” inspired by the poet Dan Smith of Listener? He says that at every show.
Nail polish just doesn't look aesthetically pleasing on chunky man hands, sorry
Julien gives me the happiness of Steve from Blues Clues vibes with an Oliver Tree haircut. So proud of you!
I miss them both but I'm glad they are happy!!!
I want one
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Love seeing that wedding band on Julien’s finger 🥰
FRICK OFF JULEN!♡♡♡♡♡♡  YOUVE COME SO FREAKING FAR, FROM WATCHIN URS AND JENNAS FACEAPP WHACKASS VIDEOS, SEEING YOU FIND YOUR FIRST LIGHTS OF HAPPINESS and WHO U ARE THERE  AND LAUGHING UR ASS OFF ON THE INTERNET... AND TO THISSS!! WOWOWOWOWOW!!♡♡ IM SO- I CANNOT. ♡ we love you. ♡♡♡
I absolutely love this. Thank you Julie for normalizing masculine heterosexual men wearing nail polishes!
Am I the only one racing here to see him saying Jenna is coming back to us 😭
Am I trippen or did he get The Debbie Machine tattooed on his bicep ????! 😆
the collab I never knew I needed but am so happy about! <3
HOW IS THERE NO "JULIEN YELLOW"?!
Hello! It’s been a while Aries! I love your vids and I’m still sad Jenna has left. You are one of my most favourite YouTubers!
i miss her and i hope someday she will come back to say hello to all of us again i hope your having a blessed day julien
can we get a tattoo tour soon 🙏🙏🙏
I hope you and Jenna are doing great. I love you and Jenna and I am glad you still mention Jenna every so often because it makes me want to cry knowing she chose to leave just because of a few mistakes she made ten years ago. And I hope she can come back and update us every so often as well because I miss her too.
Does anyone know if Julien has any social media still? I made a garbage plate!!! Obvs inspired by him and Jenna bc I’ve been binging their videos and I had to make it lol. I wanted to send a picture to them so If anyone knows can u please lmk. Love u Jenna and Julien ❤️
Is that a wedding ring?!!! Did we not get told something here
I don't really keep up with Julien, so I have to ask. Are half the people commenting his name spelling it wrong unintentionally? Or is there some kind of joke I missed? Half the comments here are spelling his name "Julen" instead of "Julien".
Not here looking for dog month upload.
I miss Jenna xoxo
That's awesome, I love nail polish, I need to get new polish.
When she said "jullliienn" it helped with my Jenna need lol
Your hands look sooooooooo good!!! I'm obsessed with every color, all of them are such vibes. The purple and the green blow me away💘💘💘
Helllllll yeahhh
Omg!! Do Gel colour next pleaseeee!!
I showed this video to my son cos he’s always liked painting his nails and as soon as he gets home from school he asks me to take it off cos of how the kids  are about it. As soon as he heard your reasoning for painting your nails, he said “that’s like me!” Thank you from a proud momma ♥️
These look devine!
why the hair? wtf
I am so unbelievably happy for you! Xox
I did not even no Julien still made vids
Lol...It's Joe Exotic.
How to know you've lived in LA for too long: When your arms look like a child drew all over you while you were sleeping, you have the hairstyle of bully from an 80s movie, your latest " hobby" as an adult male is..painting your nails.. something that used to typically be associated with 13 year old girls and slumber parties. If I see you driving a van I'm calling the police.
OMG CONGRATS JULEEEN ❤️❤️❤️❤️
HELL YEAH, been needing this . Thanks julien
“She liked it so she put a ring on it”
I'm so late and now it's sold out 😭
I was just watching an “explore with us” video on the murder of a 19 year old girl named Sarah stern. In the video was clips of Sarah meeting several of her favorite YouTubers and Jenna and Julien were included. I don’t know if they knew about it but I found it extremely sad
That hair though 😰 That with the porn stache gives me 80s teachers and their sexual harassment
the blue 😍😍 that is my ultimate favorite shade of blue nail polish❤️❤️ so proud of you!!
So this dude on “Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend” episode 1…  Totally trying to steal Julians look.   Jussayin…   He has no Holo Taco though so…  Eat that imposter dude!
I've never needed something more in my life
This is so cool !! 💖 You’re better then me at painting nails damn. Also say hiii to Jenna we miss & love her !!!
Omg just made my night
Ok  whatevs lol
I’m watching while I wait for monstera with a glossy taco to dry! Loved the colours! Bought three shades!
you are the cutest, long live holo taco
who tf are you? and why haven't you followed my twitchchannel that I play pokemon unite and make it a fun competitive game <3
Looking great julien and love that shirt on u
He got da twitch purple and called it I'm Live this is genius
"Don't be done breathing!" - Excellent advice there
This is such a delightful crossover - much love to everyone involved 💅🏼💚
I loove the I'm live one <3! Great name and colour. Win!
I thought he was proposing to Jenna …. :/
Was I the only one thinking he was gonna say they were pregnant and he now had someone to paint his nails just me?  Ok..
BEP BEP BEP BEP!!
I'm so excited!!! I just got magical mustache and I can't wait to use it to not paint mustaches but instead sunflowers on my fingies. Thanks Julen :D 🌻
I like the idea of a nail salon where everyone dries their nails by doing "bep bep bep" claps until they're dry.
Yess beautouber Julien!!
Omg I thought you were going to put up wedding photos of you and Jenna or something. It's nail polish. 😂
this is so freaking awesome!! as someone who’s watched both you and cristine religiously for YEARS, it’s like a dream come true that y’all have collaborated on something so great. so happy for you julien <3
I JUST GOT GREYT IN THE MAIL!!!!! And sunset simulation lol. They’re beautiful!
i thought this was going to be about their wedding.... :(
Will you be restocking your Aries crewneck merch??? Pretty please with sugar on top!!! Congrats on your nail collection- can’t wait for my order to arrive 💜
Where’s Jenna?! I miss her SO much!! I used to spend hours watching her videos! She’s so funny and adorable and real! Jenna, please come back!
julien seems to be doing a lot of promos lately... perhaps saving for a wedding? ;) <3
Congrats, Julien & Simply 💅🏼🖤💜💙💚🤎
What happened to the Shane Dawson podcast on the Jenna Julien channel?  It was hilarious and one of your most viewed.  ???
Couldn't this have been done painting dogs toe nails... birthday month😔
Can you please tell Jenna we miss her and want her to come back
Do you sell them separately?...because the green is just 🥰
That’s awesome man
You picked some pretty great colors! I really love the purple. Congrats on the collab!!
I absolutely love all of these colors! Including the brown, however, the saying is “green thumb” 😆
I discovered you by accident and I lovvveeed what I saw. You and your gf are relationship goals 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
So cute, I love it!!
Love this! Clearly and genuinely something you believe in. The gunmetal gray and the baby blue are my favorites!
Loves!!!!
i am so surprised there isnt a julien yellow!
I know I’m broke but I quite literally need every color. These are ALL perfect for my taste. Only thing Julien needs is a Julien yellow (neon yellow) an Aries energy (orange red) and a peach for peach!
I'm so into these colors!  Totally would wear all of these colors.
Just got my order!!! I couldnt afford all of them even though i REALLY wanted them all! But i got grey and green, and I cant wait to wear it!!! Theyre gorgeous <3
Such a beautiful person
Is there gonna be a restock?? 😭
Jenna please come back. Life is just too short for you not to make us all smile again 🥹. It genuinely makes me depressed that you left 😭
Can we talk about the Monstera leaves on the box though?!?! So pretty! ♥️🍃
I was dreaming so much last night that Jenna came back with new videos it felt too real
So happy that men increasingly are allowing themselves to enjoy hobbies that are considered feminine. It feels so good to just let who we truly are unfold and be seen. Fuck gender norms!
Jenna please come back.
SO PROUD OTTER JULIIIIIIEEE 🥺🤍
Love all the colors but I think I like monstera the most. It's not so bright and not so dark. Like how do i explain it, it still feels alive even if it's not too bright?
BEP 💅 BEP 💅BEP 💅
The whole collection feels very cohesive, giving me nature vibes with a touch of... I don't know the right words. A human element? Like a park bench shaded by some trees, overlooking a field of flowers. The trees and flowers would have been nice on their own, but the bench is hella inviting and makes you want to play with them all the more. That grey out here making me want to play with nail art for the first time in years, especially if all those other colors come with it... Congratz on the collab collection! It looks awesome!
Jenna needs a real man
I didn't know of you but what said about nail polishes is totally true and I agree with you 100%👏👏💅💅
Congratulations!
You should invest in some quick dry spray for your nails. You can get it at any beauty store including ulta or Sephora
I turn on a video to keep me from getting bored while waiting for my nails to dry. I love holo taco because it drys fairly fast. I also fan my nails to dry them.
Seeing the kitchen sure makes me miss aeries kitchen vids
Christine still has her sizing sticker from purchase on her right arm/sleeve lol
Dream collaboration! Gonna buy with next paycheck! Happy to support you Julien and (&Jenna&Marbles&Kermit&Peach) Cristine (&Ben&Menchie&Zylar)
Congrats Julian !! I know it doesn’t mean much cause I’m just one little comment out of tons and tons but I’m happy to see you grow and do what you love!:) <3
AND SHES VEGAN
loVE
I'm waiting for another announcement, one revolving around June 18th 2020😅🙃
I can't wait to get this bundle on Saturday!!! <3

So sad that I’m just now seeing this and the collection is already SOLD OUT!!! 😭😭 Congrats, Julien!!! ❤
Miss Jenna so much
Scream runs around the house 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ *Fuck yes , do it to’em*
"I'm... sorry?" offended Canadian at fistful of nail polish
Ive never been brave enough to paint my nails... I think it is about to change because I can kinda follow along with this video

Half wishing there was a "julien yellow" in there but i respec the aesthetic

Im so freaking happy for you dude!!!!!! this is amazing! My uncle has a polish brand here in Brazil, I'm already dreaming of a collab of you & him lol I loooooooved the shades of your collab!

Im wearing now one of my favorites, which is a clay shade vibe, I think you would love it!!!

This is so cute! Congrats Julen!
Are they restocking?!
I started painting my nails black almost two years because I thought yours looked so cool — now, I paint my nails all kinds of colors! I always hated being too "girly," but now I just embrace it, so believe it or not it's been a process for me lol — anyway, CONGRATS! This is so cool :)
really just came back for the cash grab. gtfo bro
Awesome colors!!!! I miss Jenna and the dogs.
This is magical✨
That's really cool it takes me back to model paint like for cars or star wars figures,Its brilliant.😎🔪💅.
im very excited about ur holo taco collab... also can we get a marbles update?
IM SO PROUD OF YOU BESTIE!!!!
Not me running to go buy love you and henna I’m so excited this is so cool!
Cool 🙂
Did Julie forget he used to be a professional photographer/videographer? 🙃
This kitchen is the size of my apartment lol
This is amazing I love it! Congrats Julien!!!
I was literally painting my nails 💅🏽 with halo tacos Menchie the cat polish when I started watching! I had no clue about this collab. It was meant to be 💜💙💚🤎
What is this aries urg to have a color sleeve and a b/w sleeve? Cuz currently same.
MOK!
Hoping you'll get the polishes back in stock soon!
I’m so proud of you ❤️
I just wanna know what's going on with the mullet. I live in Australia and I see enough of them these days.
Not julien saying let’s paint our nails WHILE IM PAINTING MY NAILS!
Not julien saying let’s paint our nails WHILE IM PAINTING MY NAILS!
Vegan and cruelty free <3 <3 <3
Ah HEW YEA
Beautuber alert 🚨
OMG, that smile melts My heart
i'm sooooo sad holo taco doesnt ship to my country😢
Mine will be here tomorrow and I’m SO EXCITED!!! Congratulations on the successful launch 💜💙🤎🖤💚
No Julien yellow?
THIS IS SO EXCITING!!! CONGRATULATIONS  JULIEN I AM SO SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU <3
I painted my nails with one-coat black while watching this. Thanks for the reminder!
This is so great Julien!!!!
This is awesome!! so proud of you Julien!!! congratulations 🎉🎉 I'm just sad I missed it (didn't get notified of this video) love you so much ❤❤❤  ps. was able to get the brown mustache color since it's the only one left in stock :/ glad to have one rather than none ❤❤❤❤❤ can't wait to use it!!
Oh. I do like this halo taco collaboration
And a stash
Mullet
They’re engaged????
I'm so upset, I had to wait to get paid and now they're sold out :(   I really want to get them for my brother, will there be a restock?
This gave me brother sister vibes :) I love this collaboration 😍
CONGRATULATIONS!!! That is so freaking awesome!!
I always assumed the nail painting was a secret athlete insider thing.
The smirk at the beginning when you said HOLO everybody
AHHHH
When I say I say I yelled when I saw the purple😱😭❤️❤️❤️
This guy lookin like a dirty sanchez
Though was a baby. Turns out it's a ... 'check notes' ... nail polish collab... Western civilization is doomed
Bring Jenna back or I’ll kill my yak
i still miss Jenna voiceee soo muchh of she could show up just 5 min i would be happy😍🥰hope is well🥰🥰🥰
not me thinking this was Juliens coming out video...
The collab we didn’t know we needed 😍😍😍
I want these!!!!!
The amount of chaos Julen brings exactly matches the amount of chaos Cristine brings. I am 100 percent here for it 😹
This collaboration makes my heart happy. ❤️
Julien! you should invest in a nail dryer lamp unless you enjoy walking around flapping your hands to dry your nails faster, a trick that has always worked for me is to start with multiple thin layer. thin layer and either putting hands in freezer near ice maker, or sticking fingers in bowl of ice water to harden nails polish therefore it'll no longer be wet in between painting thin layers. I'll paint about 2-3 thin layers but these steps and tricks have given me the best results with painting my nails, thought I'd leave some suggestions because the WAIT TIME really does suck and I'm super impatient! Happy for you on the nail polish product line and launch! I've watched you literally since you and Jenna started dating and I had started watching Jenna back during maxnosleeves times, and she was barely getting out there and being known, at this time when I started watching, she had around 60k subscribers so I've been watching her forever and it broke my heart that she has retired from making videos but I know she what was best for her but im. sooooooo happy you and Jenna found each other and having created such a good life with each other and your dog babies! cant wait to see what the future holds for you guys!
Pretty much all sold out 😩 I hope there’s a restock 🤞
Congrats! All the colors are amazing 🤩
I used to paint my nails a lot but now I only do it around halloween, I like to cook and bake a lot and I don't like touching food with nail polish 'cause it could flake in my food, Idk how people who cook and have nice nails do it, I guess I just can't afford the quality topcoats they use because it always gave me issues, also everything took forever to dry al the time and I'd smudge al my hard work. But I do miss the art. I wish I had a good remover so I could paint my nails and then remove it as soon as I need to do stuff with my hands or as soon as it starts to look trash. But I can never find anything that actually works that doesn't make my nails feel rubbering and weird. And I have thick, strong nails. Not sure what's up with that. But I can't just have it flaking off. So I just don't paint them much anymore.
that green is gorgeous
We love you but we miss Jenna so much...also is that a wedding ring! AHHHH !
You should stop your YouTube channel and get in a cave instead of Jenna. She was genuinely so cool and fun and real.
How awesome! That's super cool
I can't believe you didn't do a Julen yellow, such a missed opportunity!
YESSSS JULIEN ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
This is so greyt 🤩
I’ve so loved watching this man grow over the years. Losing Jenna will always be an ache in my heart, but I’m so glad he still allows us into his life bc he doesn’t have to. Well done, Julen. I’m so proud of your new product.
HOLOMITA shade missing!!!!! what a shame
I’m just now seeing this and they’re all sold out in THREE DAYS!! Holy crap congrats Julien!!
Love Holo Taco !! Congratulations Julien((: So happy for you ❤️🥰💋🙏❣️❣️
HOLO WVERYBODY STOP
We love you Julien and your energy is amazing but I can speak for majority of us I believe who would love to see jenna start a channel again. Only if she's ready of course but the internet loves her, especially women my age who have grown up with her on youtube and love to relate to her growth
does anyone not see the wedding ring, did jenna and you get married
I literally was looking at your nails when you were at the Gentle Barn thinking, 'damn that purple looks amazing, I bet he wanted to match it to twitch!' and then you dropped this.... boy, you be doin it to em
Love you guys missed your face!!! Give Jenna my love!
I can't believe I missed it. I'm so proud of you omg.
i ate chikcen nuggets while watching rhis
It’s the opening that’s a dead give away!! I’m so stoked to!!!
Love the hairrrrrrr!!!!
I haven't bought nailpolish in years buuutt... 🤔  AND it's cruelty free?!  OK 😻
these colors are too good! im excited dude congrats on this <3
I guess Google reads minds now because literally two days ago my brain was wondering how Julie is going and now here you are in my YT feed. Congratulations on the new product! Not sure about the hair though.
OBSESSSSSSEEDDDDDDDDDD
Julien in his Tiger King era ???
YAAAAY JULIEN I LOVE IT
Happy belated birthday to Marbles btw!
helpful tip: dont forget to wait 17 minutes (min) between painting each layer! :-D
Every other person advertising their collabs: this is the perfect product for everyone.  Julen: I just made this bc it makes me happy, and if you like it too that's a bonus.   😝💖✌️
Going to Canada when? I just want to point out Christine has cats. In case anyone likes cats
Going to try it!
I was kinda hoping this was going to be Jenna's come back 🥺 I miss her
I am a bit triggered by the fact that he left the bottles open while he was waiting for his nail polish to dry
This is so cute I love watching both of you guys and seeing this happening is great congratulations julien so happy to see you happy
LET THE DOGS PAINT
LET THE DOGS PAINT
If you’re getting into nail polish, what about non toxic paint? Especially for animals? Green for Kermit
That's so cool!! 😀 💖
So wholesome as always
Dang... almost everything is sold out
The most precious - this makes me so excited for you
I've been watching nail logical for years now. She came off a bit odd in this video though
so pure and nice. I love you and simply :,)
Well holo thereee!
MYBBROKE ASS IS IN TEARS
beautiful shades! also everything about your style is what I aspire to be. ultimate gender envy
Wow, I haven't seen Julian in years then I come across this 😮
I hope it restocks soon. The stickers and the brown color are still available but I was hoping to get the whole thing. I'll have to watch out
Not “Bep Bep Blue” 😂
“ she liked it so she put a ring on it” I would love to see a wedding video with Jenna and Julien 🥺
Very cool 😎
I hope Julien and Jenna finally got married since she put a ring on it, hopefully he did too! This video is so bitter/sweet to watch. I still miss Jenna so much but enjoy getting to see Julien
i’m just sad that there’s not a julien yellow :(
julen, soy excite for you!!!
Julen!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations Julien!!! Top tier beautuber!!!!
When does it restock?
Omg it sold out :(
veganism has really handed you the gay card
- Here Hoping The Announcement Was Jenna Is Coming Back To Her Channel 🥲  But Still Congratulations 🎉
NGL I thought this was going to be a coming out vid 2 mins into it :D Keep it up Julien!!
I’m so happy, this made my day
Wish the collection wasn’t sold out :(
The Aries-ness really shines during the posing
imagine if they did another collab but it was just Julien and Jenna’s dogs, kinda like the menchie and zyler polishes
BEP BEP BEEEHHHHHPPP🥰 Congrats Julien!!!
It sold out so fast!😭
Bbuuuutttt did you and Jenna get married?
Julien is so great at modelling the nail polish. I like the masculine wolverine grasp! It looks awesome
You could do an entire Bob Ross painting using the colors from this set!
I still miss Jenna. So frigging much.
Soooo pretty
Oh no I missed this and it's sold out already! Greyt still available as a solo. Going to try out Holo Taco. I miss painting my nails.
Exciting!!!! So excited & happy for you. Love you & Jenna both; hope she is doing okay & is happy + healthy. Wish the same to you too. 💕💕
Omg i would call it a Skittle Nails because my nails are so round and when I cut them super short, they look like round Skittles!
im SCREAMING I CANNOT WAIT!!!!
As if nail dryers dont exist JULIEEEN! Haha love the shades
My two favorites collabing on fun content! Loving the Monstera! Julien and Cristine, GREYT job! 🖤
The realness of teaching a client how to pose their hands is the HARDEST thing to do except for when they hold their hands as hard as a statue making me have to basically break fingers lol. I'd rather do an 80 work week of pedicures tbh 😂 (I have a genuine foot phobia and yes, I'm still a licensed nail tech lol)
DUDE! That's so cool!! And the colour are amazing🤩 so happy this happend☺
holy shit what a collab combo!!
CHRISTINE IS COMING IS ALL I HEAR. 😂❤️
not even joking, the end bit wit hthe "aaand cut" as soon as he said it, my power went out for half an hour 😂how the FUCK, that coincidence is staggering. powerful aries energy in this one gg
I started crying cause I thought Jenna was gonna come out😭
But why the tiger king vibes lol 😆 🤔 😂
An easy way to take picture of your nails is to use a coffee mug or tumbler and photograph your hand holding it. Put some hand moisturizer and cuticle oil on and 🤌💋 chefs kiss
I do lots of super thin thin layers and I notice it dries a lot faster. I also use a blow dryer at times hahaha
I already need a 2nd collar of colors. Here’s some ideas:  Julien Yellow (a neon yellow similar to his extensions pony tail), Peachy girl (peach color), Marbles (a black w white holo), Bunny (a Pinkish brown), Cermet (a lighter nastier green), “It’s a Murda” (a manly blood red), JULIEEENNNN (an obnoxious neon color with tons of holo & glitter) “Aries Energy” (A orangish red)
i miss jenna 😞
the ring on his finger......my parents!!! i love them so much
woah this is epic
These are beautiful and the fact that they launched ON my 30th birthday makes my heart all happy. Congrats Julien!
Definitely thought this was a coming out video, but this is good too
A twenty minute video is perfect to have on while I paint my nails. Congrats julen:)
HAHAHA CRISTINE IS A VIRGO JULIEEEEEHNNNN DONT WOLVERINE THE POLISHES
I love how Julen chaotically applies the polish and it still looks perfect
IM SO PROUD OF YOU!!!!  you certainly made the most perfect set
I miss Jenna so much. I wish she would come back
You sweet baby Aries! I love seeing you thrive and jive! Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️
I call my cat bep bep and now I’m def purchasing just for the blue. Haven’t even seen the other colors yet
“Do you know anyone who could help me ..?” 🥹🥹🥹 yes but no
you kay
Julian what is that mullet
I’m just now seeing this and it’s already sold out! I’m so happy for you and I hope there will be a restock!!
I love looking back at julien when we first met him to now, fully fun and mulleted and tattooed and making nail polish. It’s just so cool to see people comfy expressing themselves. I think all of us grew up in very restricting environments, especially at school, and we’re all learning to fully be ourselves, and few exemplify that better than julien!
I absolutely LOVE this for you
BEEEEEEIIIIIIIAAAAASHHHH ***in Jenna’s voice
Is it Aries season again. Yeah. Sure. Let's end it with 420. That's how lit we are!!
this collab is going to text your man!!!!!!!!!
as a fan of you, and a nail tech myself, this make my heart so happy!
Audio isn't working
I WAS LITERALLY DOING MY NAILS WHEN I FOUND THIS VIDEO OMG
These are so awesome! The dry time is definitely the worst. 😂
I love this!!! So happy for you and excited to get these! I miss your videos so much!! I used to watch your vlogs every time they were up!! And all your cooking videos were my favorite!
Julieeeeennuuhh! These are all some of my fav colors and I need them. 💛  Remember to close your lids, bbz!
I haven't seen Julien in a long time....the hair threw me off so much.  I was born and raised in Southern VA, and I've seen that haircut all my life. I'm not a fan, but at least he likes it, which is what matters.
the brown...the greeeeeen!!!! THE BLUE!!!!!! congrats j dawg
"I'm not flipping you off. I'm just showing you my nail." 💅
WAIT YAY OMG IM SO PROUD OF YOU JULEN
I love these!!!!!!! That’s so exciting
Quick dry Taco 🌮
Yes!!! Oh my gosh what a treat
So proud to see how much you have achieved and the contents you have made. you've done so well, continue to push on jules.
I will be buying 🤍
When's the restock?!
I am in love with the green and brown they are like the perfect green and brown
So wait …. Did he just also announce that him and Jenna got married???!!!
I'm surprised that he didn't do a Julian yellow color lol
I love you Julien! Your doing such great things for the world <3 <3 <3
We need a Julian yellow called “Aries BS”
I need Jenna! She got me through so much for so many years and holy crap I miss her
This is awesome! We love you Julien!
I just found out about this, and I’m so sad it’s pretty much sold out already! I want the whole box set so badly! I’m a trans masc person who loves nail polish (especially Holo Taco!), and my name is Julien (I was actually inspired by you when i chose my name ❤️)! I really wish I could have a box with these awesome colors and my/your name on the cover. I don’t know if you have any control over this, but could you maybe see if Holo Taco could do a restock?
I miss Jenna
I’ve been looking for that shade of green!!!
Awesome
A collaboration I never knew I needed
The title caught my attention within 0.00003 seconds BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP
No way!!! So cool!!!🥹😍
Had a busy weekend, it took me 2 days to watch this video... And why are my eyes feeling wet? I'm just incredibly proud of your accomplishment, we all are. I can go on and on but I just wanna say, hell yeah Julien!
Cop
Aww Julien-UHH. This collab is 🫶🏻
those colours look absolutely gorgeous with your tattoos
this is amazing, will this ever be back in stock or is this a limited run?
My dude I was craving a baby blue on my nails this week and just bought a cheap one, ofc the same exact weekend yall come out with this, I'm only a little mad at myself for not waiting lmao
SO excited for your collab! ❤️ Just a tip- if you screw the lid back on between coats, it keeps the polish from getting goopy for a while longer. (But if it does happen, there's always polish thinner! 👍)
The PERFECT opportunity to say "You know we had to do it to 'em."  and didn't.  lol Simply Nailogical had a teensy taste of what it feels like in the presence of that chaotic Aries energy!🤣🤣🤣 Way to go @Julien solomita! We are all so proud of you!!! It's a blessing to continue being able to watch you grow, thank you so much for allowing us to be a part of it! Lots of love from the Dink Fam! <3 YOU KNOW HE HAD TO DO IT TO 'EM
I won’t be able to get them for a bit but I am soooo excited for when I finally do!
I'm so upset at you and Cristine. I had been lingering, pondering, braced upon the precipice of wanting to buy, needing to buy, unable to afford, trying to convince myself that I already have enough nail polish. But you finally pushed me off that cliff and I hit a bunch of rocks on the way down. I ended up caving and getting your release, 2 other collections plus some extras.
I am so happy for your Julien. I can't wait for mine to arrive!
Arghh! The lids haven’t been put back on during the drying time. Juliiiieeeeeeeeeeennnnn!
He's finally done it guys, he's become a BeauTuber
Love the colors. Ive never thought I'd like a brown, but it would be great to have for nail art. I wish I could but this for my bday (June 16th) but the dogs decided to develop allergies so for my bday, im buying them allergy shots instead lol. So someone please buy this and tell me how amazing it is!!! ♡
restock restock restock (╥_╥) congrats Julien!!!!!!!!
Yay! I'm so happy for you!
I am honestly so happy that more things are getting less ’gendered‘, like people should be allowed to paint their nails or wear makeup or dresses regardless of their gender and sexuality! And I love that that’s slowly but surely becoming more and more of a reality!
I remember cristine sending her first polishes pr box to julien and julien was fangirling over it. :)  +how come we don't get "Peachy" named polish in peach color, c'mon. And for the oldest ones we need "f u dale" named one :D .
get a nail dryer lmao
I could just hear Jenna screaming “JULIENNNNNN” as you opened every cabinet in the kitchen 😭
I’m so very happy for you. One of these days I will be able to afford Holo taco hopefully your collection will still be around then. Fingers crossed. I wish you nothing but luck deserve it all of it
Julien it is only 3 days later and I went to check out holo taco thanks you and I just want to say congrats on the successful launch!
This look is very Eskimo Callboy.
Screaming!!! This is so awesome
Dude, that “I’M GRAYT” looks like glossy pencil lead. What a fun collection!  So happy for you Julien and for Cristine and the Holo Taco family!! ETA: love the mix of Julie and Christine’s chaotic energies. It’s hilarious watching Cristine trying to reign it in. Lol
You actually seem genuinely interested in getting your own nail polish collection. Unlike other personalities like shane Dawson's makeup collection..
Lol I bet Jenna walked in and told him to close all the cabinets 😆
I miss his videos SO MUCH!
Already sold out?! I want some… 🥹
Me: vibing and listening to him talk 9:03 Me: *eyelids widen with panic* Julen: *moves open bottle off the literal edge of the box* Me: *eyes chill*
He a beautuber, tho. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Remember when Julian looked “normal”
OMG I just realized Miss Jenna marbles herself is most likely editing and recording most videos yes we love and know  you don't want to be in the Limelight I am an introvert and have a child born on your birthday I understand you but I understand that you are so much more then the person Jenna Marbles but and a not creepy way
I almost feel like Jenna is behind most of this yes ratchet salon
The most beautiful collab and all internet history I love all of you each person that gave to this gave me the best time ever in the worst time of my life
:’) this made me tear up. so happy for you. also hope you, jenna, and the sweet pups are all doing very well.
so proud of u !! can’t believe how far you’ve come :,)
Take a shot every time you hear “skittles mani”
Miss Jenna soo so much 🥲 Glad everything is going well for you guys! Y’all deserve it! ❤️
I love this!!! Cannot be more excited for you!!
I just know Jenna is so proud of the beautuber you’ve become 🥹
soo happy for your julien but i started sobbing when you kept aying do yall know anyone... and it wasn jenna Q_Q  im 31 and crying lmao
Man that mullet IS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
I’m so proud and happy! This had me smiling so hard.
Like watching an aries bob ross tutorial. Happy little bep bep blue.
Yooooo, those colors look SO GOOD!  I think my favorite is.... All of them.  Yeh.  All of them.
Ah  yes the adhd struggle to sit still and not smudge the nails. I know it too well
I’m glad you paint your nails. People need to stop making it only for women.
Love you Julen!!!
AP BEP BEP BEP!!! So happy for you 😀
not me doing my nails while watching videos thinking to myself... damn this is a sign LOL haven't done my nails in MONTHS ya'll
I’ve officially given up on Jenna.
Two astonishing people,  two different but amazing types of vibes, this collab is just one of the best ever !
YES! I'm so excited for you!
JULEN We're all so proud!! And I super want Monstera -- that is one of my FAVORITE colors ever ❤️
I didn't think Joe Exotic was getting out any time soon.
Congrats julien!!!!!!
the colors are nice but not on a dude
No Jenna see you
What happened to this guy?
As a new nail tech, I’m so proud of you Julie! Juliens nasty boy salon 👌🏼
dang, im out of town with no wifi for one weekend and i miss this launch! 😭 I'm bummed it's sold out, but also very happy people bought it! I hope there's a restock soon 🧡
This makes me so happy to see you so happy ❤️
The colours are gorgeous! Can't wait to buy these 💚💜💙
But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world-  It would be the worst thing in the world! It would!   I am truly grateful and impressed at the subconscious office references.
OMG THEY SOLD OUT B4 I GOT TO IT NOOOOOO
I MISS JENNA SO SO SO MUCH😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m so happy i was able to get the box set before it sold out!! 😭♥️
“I’m done breathing.” “Don’t be done breathing.”
That blue would look fantastic with the Vinyard Vines polo
congrats!!!
I want Jenna back to making videos but it’s nice to see that you can have a beautiful table she won’t destroy In the process 😂
It's 'abomination' purple! Like Amitys' hair in The Owl House!
I love u Julien
Did anyone else get Uber excited when he mentioned Jenna’s channel? Jenna, we miss and love you!💜💜💜
So happy for you! Seeing that ring on your finger makes me so happy! I hope Jenna is doing well, we all miss her. 💕
so proud of you, bestie!!! the full collection is already sold out... which is sooo exciting, but also sad! :') lmao i'm excited for y'all to restock so i can grab a set <3
You're so Gender (affectionate)
I am so happy that you and Jenna and Christine exist, and I've wanted to try her polishes for ages but I've been too depressed to do much fancy stuff. But I'm motivated now, I just need to find that stuff to put around my ball because I'm shaky af
Wait that's actually so fucking cool! Congrats man, that is like a dream come true kind of thing to happen, hell yeah! <3
Soo.... you got married????
I love you but part of me thought you were gonna say Jenna is coming back 😭
I'm so sad it's already all sold out, nooo 😭😭 I just got back from camping and was so psyched to see this announcement 😅😅
Julien: Holo everyone Me: Hahahaha like holo taco? Julien: I love holo taco Me: Oh! Well then 😂 Love to see it!! This was a really fun video!!

I’ve missed this man
Yaaay Julien!!! You’re so awesome 😀😀😀
congratulations Julien!! I am so happy for you and so incredibly excited for this collab
let me tell you something important, as a fellow Aries. nail-polish drying spray. it works. it's wonderful. spray it, maybe wave your hand once, boom.
Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 u!!!!!
Yaasssssss, congratulations Julien, they are such good colours
Let's just take a moment to realize the progress of Julien and SimplyNailogicals channels 💕 y'all are amazing
So just to be clear, it is perfectly okay if I drop the nail polish?
We have the same haircut 😁 mines just neon yellow ❤️
That's so awesome, Julien! Congrats! I've also been watching Cristine for years. She has always seemed like good people. I hope it goes well for the both of you! Hoping to try some Holo Taco of some kind out relatively soon.
Love this!
Good for you Julie. Proud of you 💕
Quick dry topcoat anyone? XD
Sold! These colors are 🔥 I'm so excited to snag these! Congrats Julien!!! Send Jenna my love!!💕💕
This made me sooo happy when I saw the ad!!! You two are my favorite youtubers!! 💜💜
Congrats julie. You did an amazing job and you deserve this so much! Not sure if that ring means you're married now but i hope you both have a long and wonderful future together. 🥰
Will there be a restock? Didn't see this til it was too late! Dying for 2 of these colors that are sold out!
I'm a little surprised there weren't any shades called "paesh", "cermit", "nasty", or "meebles"
I adore Holo Taco but it doesn't ship to my location. Totally gutted!!
Julien nails look fabulous. The purple shade is so pretty.
I’m so glad you didn’t table this discussion
Sweet!!!! Congratulations julien!!! So proud of you! I bet Jenna is too!
Bruh I’ve been looking for that shade of green for AGES 🤩
I love your videoed and I apologize that I’m unable to watch you videos because it just makes me too sad thinking of Jenna
Congrats on the wedding 💕❤️💖
FINALLYYYYYY
That green is what has been missing from my life 😭 I’ve never found a nice deep green like that before 💚
This mani but with the homemade acrylics
Super happy for you Julien
a fancy pinky situation is what it is is...Thanks Julien for bringing the smiles and colors!!
a fancy pinky situation is what it is is...Thanks Julien for bringing the smiles and colors!!
yesss that purple!!! thats the best purple!
watching you talk about waiting for your nails to dry while i’m waiting for mine to dry and I look down and they’re all messed up and have fingerprints in them lmao
they’re sold out 😭 are they restocking?
i heard ''h o l o , everbody..'' and i knew enough
I lovvve this! But also, I wanted to yeet it but wanted to keep it inside and I did....kinda 🤣
Julien is honestly such a style icon
I just learned not to be heavy handed with my nail polish bc of you. Thank you
I remember when he and Jenna did their first ratchet salon vid and he tried painting Jenna’s nails and look where he is now 🥹🥹
I’m in love with every color! So excited for you doing this 🥰
Love the collection! The colors are gorgeous! The stickers? Immaculate! All around great work from everyone involved! <3
Loving the banter!!! Omg lol
Sweet!
Aw yay!! I'm so happy for you julien!!
Congrats Julien!
Lmao. I'm dead.  Or should i say,  "I'm done breathing"
Is he cosplaying right now?
That green is beautiful! woahhh
I love Julien, he's so kind and sweet, funny, and always makes me smile. But, I can't help to feel a little sad seeing the full kitchen behind him and thinking about all of the funny videos Jenna did in there. I'm so proud of how far Julien has come. It's bittersweet knowing that we won't get to see Jenna interacting (cause y'all know it would be such an amazingly chaotic video). I really hope she's doing well and I can't wait for what the future holds for you both 🖤🖤🖤
Really don't drop the nail polish. My Matcha Maker green fell off my desk and the top broke off and it spilled all over my dogs bed that was under the desk.
I just did the stupidest chuckle of my entire life when I saw "here you grow" 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣 pure joy!
jenna must have been the man of this relationship
“julen”
I am so excited to try out the green and brown!!!
The box, the shade names, all of it is so cool! Thanks for sharing julien! We love you!
this is so cute
Congratulations on your colors Julian x. . They look wonderful. Gret addition to the Halo Taco collection
OBSESSED with bep bep blue * realizes shes missing out * * smiles *
you guys should think before commenting. i’m sure julien doesn’t care for all the comments saying they’re basically only here for Jenna, or was disappointed Jenna wasn’t here or you couldn’t hear her, etc. don’t watch if all you’re watching for is Jenna. She’s done. RESPECT THAT. and be respectful to Julien and his channel by not making that the ONLY thing you care about.
Garbage content warning ⚠️
The off kilter lid on the bottle of nail polish made me so uncomfortable
Fuck I miss Jenna, but it has been absolutely wonderful getting to know you Julien and just, thank you for all the wonderful content. This is such a cool idea and I'm glad you're finding things that bring you joy! ❤️
I miss Jenna
Did I miss something?? Are Julien and Jenna engaged or married???
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT IS.   NOTHING OWO
🖤🤎💚💙
I hope when you and Jenna get married you guys match your nails 😭😭💖💖💖
Cermet gray? Paesh peach? Marpel white? Bunny beige? 😁😁😁😁
Thank you so much for posting this on YouTube!! I missed your last merch drop because I missed the twitch vods. But I will absolutely be getting this for me and my bf (I got him to start painting his nails to stop biting them and now he loves it) if it's not sold out yet lol
Nice
String up.
All of the Aries energy I’m obsessed with this congratulations Julien 🎉😂
Love the color combo though
Why don’t you say Jenna’s name like it’s a curse? I don’t understand why you alienate Jenna from your account
i loved this so much 🥺❤️
The colors look amazing. I love that each shade represents something about you. Also, your hands are very nice, you look great with nail polish. I love that you’re embracing more colored polish. Additionally… what a great gender neutral box of polish that seems high quality. Love that. Congrats!!
😍💅🏼
I felt a constant hum of anxiety until Julien mentioned the base coat. Phew! I am so relieved. Good job, Julien *thumbs up*
.... joe exotic ?
God I love him 😍
Love this for you Julien!!!
Jenna!!
Who’s a beauty Guru now biatches! I’m so excited bout this it’s ridiculous! 🎉🎉🎉🎉👍🏼💅🏼💆🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🐝🐝🐶🎉 You are amazing Julien you truly know how to entertain and I thank you so much for putting yourself out there and managing to mix and combine “a few of my favourite things”! 💜💕🎂🐝🍹🍹🐶🐈🤨Pleasz ‘Neez some more wholesome doggo content.🐩🐩👍🏼💙🧡🤍🐕‍🦺🐶🦮  Love the Color’s, they match my basketball Spectator outfit wonderfully🤩😜🥳You have outdone yourself with some pretty impressive editing but that wonderful Aries Energy spilled everywhere, it’s INFECTIOUS.  Cristine is right you bring the vibes and what’s more you bring them to share with everyone. 😊🎉💕 ♉️🐝
The first Holo Taco collection I would actually buy! I love all the shades!
That is a manly selection of colors.
Bep bep blue 🥹
So cool!
I love this friendship 🥹🫶
This is a full circle for Cristine! Halooooo!! 😆 She loves Julien and Jenna!
I'm so surprised you didn't have a color that says " had to do it to them"
I freaking love your mullet!! By far your best haircut yet
I think this might be my fav holo taco collection, I wish there was a holo in there but nothing a holo taco(top coat) can't fix
Did anyone else think that he was going to announce that Jenna was pregnant or that they already had their wedding?
Fuckkk these are so pretty🥺🥺🥺🥺
the combination of it being june and me not having followed Julien for a while meant i interpreted that title emoji a lot differently... this was still an excellent video
So freaking cool, love the colors, adore the packaging, this collab is the moment… so proud and excited for you mate 👏
Wait a minute - when did y’all get married?!? Congratulations 🎉🎈🍾🎊
Bought for my Aires kiddo.  😘 so excited!  HAD to do it to him!  🥰🥰🥰
i kinda wish there was a yellow/orange/red one called Aries Season
Ah yes just what we need!!! Another man capitalising on something women have been made fun of caring about for years!
Whole video ICONIC
OMFG 2 QWEENS CANT WAIT TO GET IT AHHHHHHH
I always express myself via my nails. Life is just more fun with paint on your nails

Order a nail dryer like in the nail salons!
You've gotten really good at painting your nails. I'm proud of you!
Jehovah God, You are a great Father.Thank You for your Son, Yeshua Ha Massiach (Jesus The Messiah) Jesus is our Living Passover. Acts Chapter 4 verse 12: " There is no salvation through anyone else, nor is there any other name under heaven given to the human race by which we are to be saved." Isaiah 9 vs. 6, " For unto us a Child is born. Unto us a Son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. " Who is Christ? Who is Jesus? Born of a virgin, Mary. Matthew Chapter 1 verse 20: " behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him (Joseph), in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that (Christ)which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. Jesus, the Christ, is God's word made flesh. Jesus is Jehovah God's (The Creator's) Word made into flesh. 1 John chapter 5 verse 7: " For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one." John chapter 1 verse 1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John chapter 1 verse 14: " And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." John chapter 1 verse 10: " He was in the world, and the world  knew Him not." Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12: " For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." How beautiful and awesome is God's Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, magnificent in all His glory, is He. Amen! John's Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven: Revelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3: " Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald." Why did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us? Christ (God's Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam's flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh(Jesus Christ's flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death  shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell. Christ, who is God's Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions. Christ died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,  Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power(God). Through Christ's sacrifice we gain Salvation through God's abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus. John chapter 3 verse 16: " For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life." Romans chapter 5 verse 8: " But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Christ came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam. Death in Adam, Life In Christ: Romans chapter 5 verse 19: " For as by one man's disobedience(Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man's obedience(Jesus) , many will be made righteous." Romans chapter 5 verse 18: " Therefore, as through one man's (Adam's) offense, judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man's (Christ's) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life." Romans chapter 5 verse 17: " For if by the one man's offense(Adam's offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One(Jesus Christ). Romans chapter 5 verse 12: " Therefore, just as through one man (Adam), sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned." Romans chapter 5 verse 21: " "So that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Do you now see that through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly? Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation. Adam's flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation. 1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, "For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive." Christ's sacrifice, the crucifixtion  of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, life, resurrection, eternal life, salvation Christ is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, waring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all. Amen! Amen! Hallelujah! Revelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: " And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. " Now do you see friends, Why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes. Now, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes. Christ is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men(us humans). God loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God's Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us. Will you accept Christ and be saved? Romans chapter 6 verse 23: "  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." John Chapter 3 verse 16: " For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that who ever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life." Salvation is free! Christ already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach, repent of your sins, and keep His commands. So who is Christ? He is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life. He is The Rock. Amen! I love you Lord! God created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know, that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes. John chapter 14 verse 6: " Jesus said to him," I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Colassians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16: He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven, and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him." John chapter 1 verse 1 to 4: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men." I hope that you know Christ, and understand Christ better now, to the glory of God. Amen! Christ is for all who will receive Him. This is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13: "Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen." Now that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Amen! Repent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name. Submit to Jehovah-God. Love God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God's Commandments. Love one another. Forgive one another. It is written, "resist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you." Hate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Only Jesus The Christ, can baptize you with God's Holy Spirit. Only Christ can give you The Holy Spirit, and the Gifts of The Spirit. Acts 11 vs. 15 to 16, " And as I began to speak, The Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, "John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit." Read Exodus Chapter 20, The 10 Commandments of God. Share the Gospel of Christ with others. God forgives. Mercy still abounds. But one day mercy will seize, and the wrath of God will come upon all the earth.
So are y'all married yet or
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh my gosh oh my gosh let me tell you I have the exact same problem when I paint my nails I’ll get done they’ll look absolutely stunning and my dumb Aries moment kicks in and I have to do something like two minutes after I paint my nails and I always always always always always… Always fuck it up, and then I have to redo whatever nails get fucked up and I am not kidding you it’s all the fucking time lmao
And so the student has become the master
I have the Holo Taco Grape cremè and it’s pretty but, this purple is stunning. So happy for you Julian. Congratulations on getting married to the coolest lady on the planet.
this is sosososo cool and i cant wait to get mine
Does this make Julen an official beautuber??
Ahhh I’m one day late and the box is already sold out!!! Sad for me but CONGRATS ahhhhh what a wonderful collab and complete success! 💕💕

BEP BEP BLUE

Well this is fun, lol. Yay, Julien.  Love seeing uploads from you.
OMG I recognize bep bep blue from a while ago omg hahahah sneaky sneaky
only criticism- where's the julien yellow
Oh thank god, I thought something happened to the dogs, good for you juli
Watched this with my 11 yo son and when Julien's waiting for his nails to dry he said "that's me" xD Two Arieses with ADHD. LOL.
I personally love glittery polishes, as well as pastel colors, bright colors, deep jewel tones, and fake nails. I do love my fake nails. I love OPI but also sample lots of other brands.
Julen this is SICK!!! I never paint my nails but I want to start now just bc ALL your colors are stunning and unique, packaging is so beautiful, and you look so happy about it all. I love this so much 👏
happy for you, sad for me as a Starbucks barista who will never get to wear these 🥲
That BLUE!!! Gorgeous <3
Lets all celebrate you Narc
mera ek YouTube se milte hai...  https://youtube.com/channel/UC6-egfxBPqq9HScsJv0JJoA

Omg i love this for you and Christine! What an unexpected, but perfectly matched collab

Did him and Jenna get married?? He’s wearing a silver band
It's already sold out :(( Been following you both for years and I'm so sad I couldn't grab the collection as a whole! But I will still support with monstera - beautiful color!!!
Hey there, please give Jenna a great big hug and tell her she still has fans out here and we miss her a ton.   I also wanted to say you have amazing hair and I’m super glad you made this collab. ❤️
Your father is disappointed. Even if he doesn’t show it.
wish you guys made a quick dry formula, would have been perfect
so cool juli! manicures are so much fun!
There's a reason why it's called a MANicure! But seriously, I love that periwinkle color and the gray.
Gulp gulp gulp metaphorically
Nasty
Ew
Julien is so hot
It looks so beautiful, Julen!!! My gosh, I'm so proud of you! Congrats, really! I bet everyone who buys it will enjoy the shades very much, they look truly beautiful and they are so you.
The box is sold out and I’m very upset about it 😭

I'm a simple man.  I see 'BEP BEP BEP' in the title, and I click.
H.omo

this makes my whole heart so happy
Congrats Julen this is amazing. So happy for you, much love!

Awww it’s THE kitchen 😭
so happy for u julien!! wanted to get the box for my friend but unfortunately u dont ship to my country
this video made me so happy you’re such an aries 😁
Holy shit it's Freddy from Borderlands 3.
OK but that but at the beginning about being able to express himself and being more comfortable is actually making me emotional? Like I’m so excited for this collection and for Julen and it makes me really happy. Congrats Julien!!!
Drying nails are the worst I just say ah f-ck it it’s gonna look good from afar
I love these colours!! These skittles nails look so so good on you! This collection is amazing, so many congratulations 💕 I don’t currently wear polish enough to justify getting this shipped to the UK particularly as I’m in the process of moving, but in the unlikely event they don’t sell out almost instantly I might just “accidentally on purpose” buy them and make sure I wear them constantly. Love the slogan in the box so much, it fits so so well! You always create the best things and also this video was also so so fun. Can’t wait to keep seeing everything else you do ☺️
You're a BEAU-TUBER WITH THEIR OWN COLLAB OMG
*not me thinking that JnJ were pregnant*
Eeeeekk I’m so excited for you. I LOVE the colors and the little stickers. So proud of you. 🥰😍
Hasan used your polish on stream yesterday with Valkyrae and they loved the colors. The polish was so pretty.
Can’t wait to wear the polish and my Fanny pack around
TAKE MY MONEY
I got mine! So excited
So happy for you Julien!!!!
how much estrogen are u injecting?
Thanku for this!!! I’d been procrastinating my pedi so this was perfect to work with. I’m so excited for these colors too wow
JULIEN?!?!?! I'm so proud of you!
When you were talking at first about painting your nails and only loving one brand, I thought, “No way! There’s no brand better than Holo Taco. So you can’t say you love any other brand before you try Cristine’s Holo Taco!” Then you surprised us with this news! This is so exciting! Congratulations!!
Eeeemotional damage
AHHH THIS IS SO COOL !! IM SO EXCITED TO GET SOME JULIE !
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
The world needed mom and dad to create this.
Congratulations!! So happy that you're happy😊 i don't wear polish but i want it still😂 just to support you❤️  and its vegan and cruelty free!
To get my nails to dry faster I used to stick my hands in the freezer. I swear it worked, but I'd always get yelled at for having the freezer door open too long :(
Yuhhhhhs
I felt your pain! At least you found a beautiful natural finger pose hahaha. I remember seeing nail polish on you over the many years, but you teamed up with Christine and did a Halo Taco special with NO HALO! BLASPHEMY! Still, totally unexpected and COMPLETELY amazing! I love it. I love you, Julien... and you Christine!  Maybe you could make some videos showing men techniques for painting their nails 💅? Hahah  Keep being amazing, Julien!
OMG JOO-LEE-UHNNN! This man must be protected at all costs!  🥰✨ We love a king who is secure enough in his masculinity to not adhere strictly to gender norms. Nail polish is beautiful and everybody should feel free & comfortable to wear it if they want to!
Stinky pinky 🤣
BEP BEP BLUE IS ME IN A BOTTLE! SO HAPPY FOR THIS COLLAB. GOOD JOB HOLO TACO AND JULIEN 👏🏼
Omg....I thought it was a fun update like maybe you and Jenna had a baby!!! Not nail polish for guys🤣🤣🤣🤣🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄😫🥴
I respect Jenna's decision to leave YouTube, and if she ever made (1) more video it would get 90M views in 1 day!
I love how happy you are about your nail polish line! I am so proud of you. Congratulations! This collection is going to be such a success I bet you will be smiling for a week straight. Also I think you should dye your hair purple to match the nail polish.
Ehhhhh bep bep bep bep
Green us down uNdA 🤪
I live this. It's so wholesome.missed watching your videos!!😁🥰
Heck YEAH Julian!!!!!! Congrats and the best of luck to you with this beautiful new product line!
I am sorry. WHAT? BOI, IF YOU DONT. I am a VIRGO!!! how you gonna just drop this here imma freak OUT OH MA GAWWHHDD!!!
That purple is super pretty! I scooped up a bottle last night ☺️
💜💜💜💜💜
Julien have you not discovered drying drops? Manicure dry time GAME CHANGER!! 💜💙🤎🖤💚
ahhhh!! Love this! :D Is this nail polish a limited edition? Or will it be around for a while? I really want to purchase this collection and the stickers but don't have the funds at the moment!
please tell Jenna I love her 🥲
So my job doesn’t let me paint my nails… just ordered mine though 🥰🥰🫶🏼 love you julien🤭
ive been on the hunt for a good brown nail polish for soooo long so im def picking that one up!
I love you and your family so much I am so excited to be able to get this!
So awesome. Love this collab. I wish we could see J's reaction. Love you there in the background OG Queen.
Give small creators a chance, smh. You all are millionaires just making each other more and more rich
Love when two amazing people work together to make something awesome!
Christine’s energy matches Jenna saying STOP 🥹♥️ love this collab!
Congratulations
The tats!!! Looking more and more like throw back goth Julie each day 😊
what's funny if you filmed the intro after you painted your nails you would've been still and calm long enough for them to basically dry lol.
Oh man, what a guy you've become. The first time I saw you was in Jenna's photobooth challenge, and now you look like a whole different person - so full of life, glowing. Painting nails sounds like a very nice hobby, I always wished to be good at nails but I'm super impatient lol. Congrats on the launch!!! Your enthusiasm makes me wanna get better at nail art too. :D
It would be so amazing to see Julian and try a dip powder manicure for the first time. 🌈
HELL YEAH!
🥺 i can only imagine how excited Jenna is about this ahahaha
wish you'd be a bit more honest and upfront about this whole video being an ad
Slay
Ha Gayyyyyyy
this is so beautiful! the time and care that was out in is so obvious and it’s so wonderful to see! i can’t wait to get these colors! ❤️
Watched Julen’s stream, watched Cristine’s stream, bought my favs, and now am watching the announcement, so damn proud of you!! Seeing your design sense and style come to life through merch and now this is so incredible! Also just wonderful to see what makes you happy and what you’re passionate about, can’t even explain how much joy that brings us all!! Love ya, papa!
This was so heartwarming 💖✨ I watched you yesterday on stream and I connected with you, I know why Cristine choose you ✨
I absolutely love this. It’s taking nail polish out of its boring “glamorous, beauty” past and bringing it into a more fun, colourful, arty present.
That green bro!!!! 💅😉👉
“BEP BEP BLUE” 😭
I have never been excited about nail polish, and the colors. I am excited about the nail polish and colors! It's the monstera and the moustache shades, but also the combo of all of them in your skittles style!
I thought u guys got married ugh bye
Watching this while I’m painting my nails lol feels like I’m just sitting at a friends house and we’re doing our nails together
Repent ye, for the kingdom of God is nigh at hand!
Love the green! Sorry Julien, love you but, we now need a JennaX kit and you will have a full on ratchet polish salon.
Guy you could have worn all of these and when people asked what you were wearing you could have said, “idk it’s polish I found that jenna had laying around.”
I'm a gay male who just started painting my nails this year. How long should i wait in between coat applications?
This is a collab I didn't know I needed in my life. 💖💖💖
I ordinarily would never buy a brown nail polish, but julen is a style icon and I trust the process. 😂 I was devastated that I missed the clothing merch drop, so glad I could catch this.
Haven't seen him in years but I have only one question- WTF happened Julian?!!!!!
Oh man that talk about expressing your creativity is so relatable, I only hope I get to express myself completely pretty soon! 💖😫💖
This actually makes me so happy. Normalize wearing nail polish! Love the colors.
Tiger King Season 3 Pilot
Anytime I’m on the verge of a panic attack.. I turn on your videos Julien 🥺 there is almost nothing that can stop an attack, but I know that any vid of yours is gonna be so calming. I mean.. painting your nails?! C’mon lol. It’s something about your energy tho 😭 I know it’s not cool to bring up the other J in J&J.. but I used to use her videos for the same thing 🥺 idk if there’s a connection or something there. Anyways, love you both and wishing you the best. Congrats on the Holo polish! Can’t wait to try it.
I don’t think I’ve related to something more than I relate to the waiting game for drying nail polish.
Shocked that orange or yellow is not in the set. Looks great tho!
How is Julien rocking this mullet!
Rumor has it Julien has noting but intrusive thoughts.
Omg i noticed the blue when you and Jason both had it on if it was the same one 😳🙈
Hell Yea!!
I’m so stoked to get my collection! Congrats Julien!!! Edit: honestly, it’s so nice seeing a male so excited over nail polish. I clearly don’t follow enough men who do their nails! 🥰
Hehe I got the notification and saw the title for the video but I decided to go to the Holo Taco site this morning first because I've been trying to catch up on the colors, and as soon as I saw the set I knew that's what the video was about! aw yay for you, and such nice colors :)
The Seche vite quick dry top coat will save you so much time
tell me why this week i got an itch to paint my nails after NOT for many many years…. then see this???? i LOVE all the shades. no-brainer purchase. excited for 3pm heheh
Almost cried when he opened all the cabinets
I knew the acrylic nails from Jenna’s ratchet salon wasn’t the end…..he has now taken full form! 💅🏽
This is awesome!
Omg sooo cool Julien 😎 😍 👌
I was fully expecting Cristine creeping by in the background, holding an equally creeping Kermit. But alas geography is not on my side. Love these shades! Can't wait :)
😍💜
I wish I was emotionally stable enough to watch this… I miss mom so flippin bad. I wish I could just hear her voice. 😭
I miss Jenna...
congrats julen!
I got sooooo excited almost jumped off my chair!!! I love this collab!!! Good job guys! ❤️❤️❤️
I love this color palette-gunmetal, purple, & sky blue are some of my favorite colors to wear when it comes to nail polish
I’m so happy about this😭❤️
I have the bump in the thumbnails too! Idk what is going on with it.
I hope Jenna is okay <3
I was just thinking about you guys yesterday😭💕
Congrats!! This is so dope!!
You need a quick dry top coat! Try Sally Hansen, it dries instantly! ❤️❤️
julien honoring jennas ratchet salon
Beautiful collection, congratulations! Literally buying that blue right this second. Side note, plz restock on merch soon. Dank! 💙💅🏻
What is going on with the hair?😊You dont need all that. Your natural look is good .Really.
I have seriously never bought something faster
the hair is givin me strong Julien Exotic vibes. Iggy King n Queen: Makeup, Marinating, and Mr Marbles
Love the colors and the box design!!
This is so so fun!! Congrats!
I feel like struggling to hold the polish bottle for pretty pics is such a #shortnailproblem and I commiserate so much
I can't believe I went looking for nail polish because of this video!
Okay. But where’s Jenna? 🥺
Julen 🥺
Welcome to Julien’s ratchet nail salon 💅🏽 ✨
the cabinet throwback!
I can't wait to get some!!
Anyone else announces this and I'm probably like :/ but JS? 🎈🎉🥳💙👍🌈
I don’t know why but I can still hear the “juLIennnnnn!” 🥺
Not me thinking Jenna was coming back lol. Love you two both!!! Can't wait to see it all.
Nailed it.
My speshul boi such a cute lil businessman gonna make me buy youtuber merch for the first time I'm so proud and so angry
I've been rocking black nails myself and this gave me an idea. I like those purple and blue colors. I'd definitely try those colors. I don't think I can order since I'm overseas but thanks Julian! I'm a dude and you're definitely right, having blank nails is just freaking boring.
JULIENNNN OMG THIS IS AMAZING… brb gonna go but the entire set 🏃‍♀️
I feel like I can never find nice shades of green nail polish so I'm definitely picking Monstera up, THANK YOU
YEAH BOIIII
I’ve needed a green like that for my wedding nails 😭 thanks julien and Cristine!
i subconsciously thought my nails were wet this entire video and I was sad when my phone charm brushed my pinkie bc I didn’t wanna mess it up and then I realized my nails are literally naked currently
15:24 felt like you were blessing us. Also I just realised she's wearing your merch ☺️. Pickle juice electrolytes for the win.
For the first time EVER I bought two collection boxes! I don’t know to who or how yet but I plan on possibly(not a 100% yet)selling the second box at a fair price, not crazy high scalper prices. I wanted doubles of all the polish’s and it was cheaper than added them individually.
I haven't watched one of his videos in so long and he's changed so much!
Really glad simply nailogical came on, she has a similar energy to our dear Jenna
Dude that nail drying mood...my adhd self every time (and partly why I don't do it any more). So excited for you all. Big mood. Big moment. That personal nail coach call 😅 skittle, every colour of the rainbow. You right julen.
So excited!!! And snagged it!!!!
I miss Jenna
Yes 🙌🏻🥹🤍😭👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I named my son Julien after you and now I need to paint his nails bep bep bep blue
Hahaha this video made me laugh so much. So proud of you both making such a fun collab! I’d love to see more shades!
We miss Jenna man
😲
Called me a consumer
Why did I think this was a baby announcement 😂
This is the most perfect collab there could have been <3 If you haven’t used Holo Taco before and have trouble staying still I highly recommend their polishes! They dry wicked fast and are a lifesaver for us that can’t sit still 😄
This is so exciting!
glad for you julien!!
Sweet chaotic Aries boy waiting for his nails to dry is my favorite
I want to see hasanabi wear these
🥰🥰🥰💅
So proud of you Julen!! Why am I crying??
Balance the fifth one on top of your fist
Omg yesssssssssss
Holo!
julien i am so so sooo proud of you!!! i cant believe how far youve come in the years ive been watching. this is so exciting and feels so truly you, i love everything about the collection! <3 congratulations!!
congratulations!!! i just know jennas so excited for you and christine!
Yasss
Rad!!
😭😭😭😭😭💞✨
bep bep blue speaks to my soul
As a fellow plant lover I am so happy to see the monstera color!!
Jenna has a channel? Someone tell me plz, i love Jenna
Yay JULIEN! This is so awesome. My fiancé loves when I paint his nails. I know he will love all these colours. I wish Jenna was painting your nails at her ratchet salon 👱🏼‍♀️💖 CONGRATS!
We need more Julien and Cristine content!!! I was laughing so hard at this <3 love you guys and congrats on the collab! P.S DON'T DROP THE NAIL POLISH!
You are giving me delightful Tiger King mullet vibes and I love it! 🥰
This is so exciting Julien! Ive also randomly gotten into painting my nails again. I didnt for years because Ive always worked physical jobs and didnt see the point. I still work a demanding job. I wear gloves to cover my hands so they never see the light of day. Maybe its just that Im more bored lately. Maybe its because summer is here. But I cant wait to get my hands on these and FINALLY try some HT.
if I paint my nails every time without fail I will need to pee right after even if I pee before
I was seeking that exact shade of blue for my sister's wedding. Thanks for making it 4 years later lol 😆
I'm in love this is the best collab! If I weren't broke I would be all over this. THAT GREEN THOOO 😍 👌🏾
As soon as you announced the collab, didn’t even see the colors, went to the website and purchased the whole box. You, sir, have become what I aspire to be. I loved seeing your transformation over the years of becoming yourself!
Is Jenna coming n back
Looks like he is turning into the "Greyhound King"
I’m crazy excited about this. And so happy and excited for youuuuuu! And I love iT.
Julien's simply Aires salon... coming soon to a location near you!
do Not get paint on the table!
HELL YEA BOII
Congratulations! While this is a great announcement, I’m going back into hibernation until you make an announcement about Jenna coming back.
The sign language I love you pose was the cutest 🤟🏼
Can't wait to get mine 🥰
I just know Jenna’s so proud of you rn🥺 Congrats Julen, you’re doing amazing sweetie
'I'm done breathing' - but I am not done laughing at that sir!
So exciting!!
Same man literally same
I thought you were going to announce your debut Drag Show, I was so excited for you to join us big girls. 🤘🌼
THE STICKIES!!!!!!!!!!! omg i love it all ! What an amazing collab ! *Q*
“I need to take beauty shots, do you know anyone that could help me?” Julen, you know Jenna owns the best beauty salon
JULIEN please make a video with Hasan Piker (a fellow nail painting king) you are both twitch streaming, nail painting KINGS. Maybe a nail painting stream? I adore you both and cannot wait to paint these bad boys on my nails! Please give my regards to Jenna, you are my IDOLDS and I wish you and Jenna all the happiness in the world. It was hard when Jenna left (however I completely understand) and your amazing content and personality has kept me going these past few years. I wish you both (and all the doggos) all the happiness in the world, and thank you for all you have done. Love, from a 10 year fan. I cannot thank you enough for the content and dedication. You keep me going Julien, thankyou truely ❤️❤️❤️
Ahhh!!! I'm so happy for you and proud of you Julennnnn ❤️❤️❤️ I cant wait to get these nail polish colors!!
what an awesome birthday present x thanks Julien
I think it's called a Skittles mani because it's "taste the rainbow" but there's only five colors, not six
So dope!
I don't keep up with him enough. A toddler and baby keep me so busy. Are they married yet or does he just wear an engagement ring? I love them so much!
do u have a tattoo of the debbie machine
Wow!! These are fantastic colors!! So unique! Love them!!
Sending love Julen. Congrats!!!
Legit purchased immediately. I’m so excited for Monstera specifically, but imma use all them little bitches
Just ordered some!!!!! I'm so excited :D and happy that two of my favorite people got to collab <3
Love the theme of growth. It suits you so well.
bumps I'm your nails are typically a sign of health problems. Please, ask your doctor about it some time.
congrats Julien, I've been following Jenna/you for many years and love to see all your achievements; also love to see the plants made it onto the packaging 🌿😅
Honestly this collection is BEAUTIFUL!! The colors are so good for either gender; some of my favorites that Holo Taco has released!  It's so satisfying to see a truly GRAYT male polish collection, after the crappy ones that Cristine reviewed a few months ago.
SOOOO HAPPY FOR YOU!   p.s. did I miss the marriage announcement?❤️
Just ordered! so excited!!!
Am I tearing up? Also, I adore these shades! Yay Julien!
Makes me so hppy
I didn't know you were in a band, Julien https://youtu.be/75Mw8r5gW8E
julen holomita
That's so awesome congrats!!
thank you for my early birthday present
STOPPPPPP I CANT OMG IM SO EXCITED BEP BEP BEPPPP
I should start by saying I NeVEr buy myself anything more then $20 but 5 minutes into this video I already had this in my shopping cart and was about to click buy when my boyfriend desperately grabs my phone away from me. I thought he was going to lecture me for spending money but It turns out that he may have already gotten me this for my birthday next week… He said he camped your stream and everything! I thought it was to funny and had to share.   Anyway I will be back when the package arrives so I don’t spoil the surprise any more. Love your vids!
BEST COLLAB EVER
The Bep Bep Blue is EVERYTHING I’ve wanted in a shade of blue!!!
Not a video I thought would make me cry and yet!? I’m obsessed with you, Julen 💜
Look at you. Living your best life! I love it!!
BEP BEP BEP  ORDERED
So its anyone gonna tell him about the quick dry top coat?
Awww look who's a Beautuber now!!   JULIEN'S RACHET SALON IS OPEN
This is amazing! 👏🏼👏🏼🎉
Ever since the 2014 funky webcam video youve become a hero of mine.
DUDDEE YALL HILARIOUSSSS!!!!!
Congrats Julien! I’m so proud of you and this collection is gorgeous! Just ordered 😊
10/10 favorite collab ngl
Julien have you thought about getting a UV nail drying lamp? :)
100% bought the Monstera one because that green is just so perfect
Brown skittles?  Just kidding, congrats sir.
i had no clue what this is about, but as soon as you said "we're gonna sit here and im gonna paint my nails" iwas like "oh he should do a collab with cristine!!" and lo and behold, lmao
Boy his videos have not popped up in my feed in quite some time
WANT! Congratulations Julien!
judged. thank you.
I'm so jealous! I can't wear nailpolish due to work but these look wonderful. Really happy for you!
This is my dream come true TT
Came to the video to see how to style that brown polish because it's so different broooo helpp
I don't wear nail polish enough to buy it, but dang the grey is exactly what I'd use! Love this colour palette overall!
I don’t even use nail polish but that box design and those colors are so beautiful I’m considering the purchase! 😬 plus, why wouldn’t I want a jump scare from Julien every time I open that thing haha congrats on the collab!!
My faves collabing💜💜
So proud Julen, you're a beautuber now😭😭
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Best collab ever!!! It makes me so happy to see you both so proud and excited about this collection! You both deserve all the success that comes your way!
You Bep Bep Blue me away. Mr. Sir. Julien’s Salon is Live! Congrats to our favorite Aries Monstera beautuber, with a face & personality to rock any Magical Mustache. Can’t wait for my S/O & I to step up our manis from good to Greyt!🌈💅🏾🥳
I'm so proud of you, Julien! This is a great collection.
From Jenna’s ratchet salon, to Julien's salon 💅
I can’t get over this but I love Juliens style. He just looks so cool 😂
tattoo tour would be cool
💛🥹💅
I love your streams but I cannot watch much because I get over stimulated .
This is so cute! Love the colors!
I'm so so so so proud of you Julen! What an amazing collab! I'm sooooooo excited to get mine!!!!
I find it virtually impossible to wait for my nails to dry. If the nail polish doesn’t dry in 60 seconds I WILL mess it up 😂
This is so exciting!!
When two of your biggest comfort YouTubers collab. lol.
Why do you have the same vibe as Mr. Rogers
YES MY FAVS, TOGETHER
He's officially one of the beautiful people :O Congrats Julien!
I just want Jenna. I never realized how much control she had over my endorphins. 😑
Are you the first straight man to drop a line???
This happiness is so contagious. Especially seeing the "Julien" written on it :)
When he talked about his ringfinger and said "she liked it so she put one on it" my heart melted, they're so cute and I'm so happy for them <3
JENNA PLEASE COME BACK 😢💔
Julien, you’ve really come so far from being Jenna’s Ratchet Salons apprentice! 😂
Will simply ever collab with Jenna? I would be first in line for a jenna holotaco nail polish.  I'm definitely buying juliens 😊
Bep Bep Blue, that’s such a cute name 💙
“She liked it so she put a ring on it” 🥲🥹 I love you guys! And I love this collection, the colors are beautiful and I can’t wait to play with them when the box comes in! Congratulations, Julen! Of all the humans to collab with, I’m glad Simply collabed with you. Couldn’t be a more perfect pair.
I remember Jenna’s videos showed me Cristine’s channel! Now seeing that Julien and Cristine are doing a collab makes my heart swell. Both of you are amazing and positive influencers. Congrats on the collab and I hope there are more to come! 💙
I love all the colors !! Good job juuuul. Also we all love and miss jenna . hope she comes back one day
I also struggle with the waiting process!
Omg! So exciting! 😊
don't be done breathing! LOL
ugh I wanna watch this now but I wanna wait till I get home so I can paint my nails with you as I watch. 😅 BRB❤
"Don't be done breathing." -Cristine, 2022  such a great quote with or without context 💅
DID I MISS SOMETHING? IS THAT A WEDDING BAND?? I KNEW THEY GOT ENGAGED BUT DID THEY TIE THE KNOT??
🤢🤮🤢🤮
The fact that I started this video while I was doing my nails bitch… I am about 2 min into the video… haven’t even shown the product and I ordered the collection right away lmaooo can’t wait to try them!!
1. Love the collab 2. Love the return of the Aries energy
You go Glen Coco!
What a beautiful collection!!!
I’m begging, please do a jewelry haul. Your style has evolved to be so fkn dope!!! P.s ordered purple and green! ♡
the waiting is something I relate to way too much.
Just noticed the wedding ring congrats
love that green
I absolutely love this. So proud of you Julen! Stay you dude! 💛
SO COOL! two lovely, fab and kind creators collabing, amazing:)
Tell Jenna I miss and love her
Smiling on entire video and so proud of you Julen ❤, what an unexpected collaboration 😂.
watching julen get excited about painting his nails makes me so giddy
This is awwwwesome
Your hands are beautiful 😍
This is such a great collab, I’m so impressed
with that intro I thought it was a coming out vid hahaha
I’m so proud of you Julie❤️❤️❤️ I’ve always been a big fan of nail polish and that’s how I found simply, and I don’t know why but it feels so nice to know that you love it too, it’s something that even though it’s become normal for guys to wear nail polish it still feels pretty special and really transformative trust you started your own collection of nail polish just because you enjoyed the expression it brought, it’s so simple yet inspiring❤️ and I’m so good you worked with cristine she’s just such a pure lovely soul that I know will be so good to you and take care of you and genuinely listen to your thoughts and give honest business feedback, congratulations Julian super happy for you❤️ ’
does anyone else, with how Julien looks, want to see him have an MMA bout with Jake Paul?
I dont use nail polish because of the smell 🙃 never liked it even as a child. Even when the nail polish is dry it smells so intensely it wakes me up at night haha
As a transgender man, I used to paint my nails all the time when I was still in the closet. Now that I've been out for many years, I still can't bring myself to wear nail polish because people already question my gender so much - it would be one more thing for people to point to and say "see! You're not a real man"  I hope someday I can be more confident to wear nail polish again, though, cause you rock it so well Julien. Congrats on your collab!
blonde looks great on you! brings put your eyes
“these (bare) nails are boring. let’s put some damn color on them, and love our lives loudly and expressively” - julien solomita, 2022  that’s going to be my motto for the rest of time.
What's the track on 3:07???
"dont be done breathing" lmao
Juul you are very slay.
THIS IS SO COOL
In this video, Julien loses his mind waiting for his nails to dry
i thought the cactus was your stand emote at first💀💀🤣💀🤣🖤🕴🏼
Love the magical mustache, bep bep bep, and greyt
I love this. I didn't even know they did collabs.
how sweet is this!??!
You seem genuinely happy and proud of your collab which is awesome! Congrats Julen!
She did like it and put a ring on it 💍
So happy to see you happy
Christine reminds me of Jenna so much. I can only imagine how much fun this project was for everyone involved!
I thought this was Esikomo/Electro Callboy
This is a very Aries video
I remember the video where you dyed your hair yellow and you were so excited about it because your parents never let you haha It's amazing to see how you have evolved as a person since then!
I'm legitimately surprised that I'm 10 comments deep, and not one person is talking about that sweet, sweet mullet. His whole vibe is impeccable.
I love and absolutely support Julien’s style evolution through years!!!
This makes me so happy. I have had one of the stinkiest weeks. Lost partners luggage and laptop, missed 2 weeks of uni because I was away, when we came back we got covid so then lost 7 more days of uni, dealt with stinky people and stinky triggers. To now sit down at my computer and find out my girl Cristine and my pal Julen are collaborating. BIGGEST AWWWWWWW
“intrusive thought” *says it out loud*
I love this!!! The “Bep Bep Blue” & “I’m Live” are definitely my favorites!! I stopped wearing polish ages ago but love these colors & both you & Christine so might have to splurge! I love the packaging too! The only thing cooler would have been one of your pins coming with it. Maybe if you ever do another collab you could add a limited edition pin? Maybe one that matches the box art? 🍃 😃
Best collab in history 💿
Quik dry nail spray!
GAYEEEEE!!!!!
This is so cool, honestly, I love this
Julien, no lie, I barely watch you now, but nail polish has become such a huge self care routine for me in the last few months.  Watching you paint is still me some days, but it's so rewarding and I have to say, the selection is great.  Your enthusiasm is rad my dude.
This is so coool guys!!!😍😍😍
From the first time we were introduced to you to this day, you've changed a lot!  I don't mean that in a bad way, cuz everything about you is simply awesome.  I was taken aback by the sleeves and hair.  So badass!
Me thinking he was gonna announce Jenna's return. Oh well. Nice collab tho🔥
Uhhhh I need those
As an Aries I just want to say, “I know how to act right, I’m just remembering.” Is peak Aries energy. Besitos y’all
I've seen the titel with the nail paint emoji and thought "oh no, why is he launching his own nail polish line, when he'd better collab with holo taco"
5:49 I love how it's OUR thumb
I've been looking for than monstera green for YEARS!!!!!
They should do a nude polish line, and have a shade called ‘bottomless to get to the top’ and reference Julien’s skin tone
Nobody asked for 😂 and nobody actually cares. We just clicked because we hoped it had something to do with Jenna/her coming back 😅
Congrats Julien. The colours are epic.
I love this so much
OMG...when did they get married???? I'm just NOW seeing his wedding ring!!!!! Congrats to the both of you!!!! Way to go on the colab as well!
I didn't know I needed this video. Julien painting his nails is a great mood.
Julien!!!!!! These are the perfect colors 🥹🥹💛💛
Love the colour choices!
Wowow! Best new I've gotten all day. Congrats Julien!!!!
BRING BACK JENNA!!¡!!!!!¡!¡
I don’t know if anyone of you notice but he’s wearing a ring on his finger 💅🏼💍 does that mean he propose to Jenna or did they get married?
I miss seeing jenna in your videos :,(
OMFGGGG IM GRINNING LIKE CRAZY LOL
I thought Jenna was finally pregnant
The way you were stressing out Christine 😂😂
Yessssssss Juuuleennnn I’m so pumped for thiiiissss
My dude lookin like a member of Eskimo Callboy
Tigre king lookin different
Yessss!!! This is everything!!!!!!!
I keep getting thrown off when he calls I’m Live purple bc it’s like that confusing shade between purple and blue and I personally thought of it as more blue haha
I feel that Jenna is responsible for that hair 😂 Please always paint your Nails 🤠
When Julien went to open all the cupboards I literally said “ oh my god you’re going to give Jenna a heart attack” 😂❤️
is he bi?
Ayoooo?? 👀 let's fuckin go! I am wearing Holo Taco rn and pretty much all the time. I am so surprised by this collab but I love it, they really are amazing polishes!!
I thought jenna was pregnant 🥲
I've never been so gutted to be allergic to nail polish, I'm gonna throw UP... I will be buying this for friends though
These colours are so good. Perfect! Will be ordering it for my two teen daughters.
YAAASSSS this brought me so much joy i started crying when you said it, i aaaam so excited, best collab ever! And i 100%agree on expressing yourself through what you wear and what you look like! Loved every sec of the video and the nail polishes! 😱😱 so excited! 😍😱😍😱🎉
He looks sooooo good I’m going crazy!
about bloody time
I miss jenna i feel like low key there married and now have babies lol
So happy for you ☺️ They’re beautiful!
I watched once, went and bought, then watched three more times. I’m so freaking excited for you and holotaco!
Can you imagine a more aggressively Guy From California person, aesthetically? (I think it's cool)
That purple threw me back to Cobra Starship and the hoodies they had.  I love this collab v much
I love you guys so much but do we need to be worried because there are more and more men like this? 🥲
Sadly because of my Job i dont really wear Nail Polish but I am so proud, they look really good!
Congratulations ❤ this is soooo cool 😍
The coaching part was so chaotic and fun!
When you opened all the cabinets I can just hear Jenna yelling, “Julien! OMG! IM A VIRGO YOU MONSTER!” 🤣
Omg this makes me so happy! I know Jenna loves Christine!

Ehhh BEP BEP BEP BEP!!! Love you, Jenna, and Miss Christine!!! I miss Jenna so much and I really hope she comes back at some point 🥺 been a fan for many many years.

We have come full circle, love you both.
this is genuinely the coolest thing I’ve ever seen happen
Nail polish is awesome love them, also on men pretty damn stylish! Congratulations! Beautiful shades dud.
It’s like Cristine being Jenna trying to steer Julien into something resembling some order 😂 Absolutely loved it! Beautiful colours! The purple is stunning!
Oh my gosh! I am so happy for you Julian!!!!
I need more information about the pickle juice for cramps!
congratz !!!! :D
Everyone get you a Box!!
The mullet omg
Pro tip: if you lick your fresh nails and it’s bitter, the nailpolish needs more time to dry. When it’s fully dry it tastes like nothing.
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh YESSSSSSSSSSSS
he gave it away with the HOLO everybody! Congratulations!!!! These colors are stunning.
A collab between two of my favourite people on the internet, doing what they love. This is indeed inspiring 💜
You're so cute x happy for you

I’ve literally been growing out my nails this is perfect
I stopped right when he said it’s up to buy and I bought the set lmao
Enjoy the collaboration! Loooove our girl Simply 😁😁😁 is Jenna okay? Please can you give us an update on her and the dogs? We miss her so much 😭😭😭

Can’t wait for my bep bep and greyt. So proud of you both
Petition to have julien get his nails done in the nail salon I’m talking flames and smiley faces CRAZY
I am happy for you julen. You seem so excited about this project and it's just a joy to watch that.
Julie stifling his Aries energy to put on yet ANOTHER coat of Halo Top Coat and not do various things is a level of patience I still strive to achieve.  Well done Cristine
Hasan abi would love this  nail polish kit!
collab of the century the avengers couldnt even dream of this
Watching this made me want to paint my nails!
SO EXCITED FOR U JULIE!!!!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖
I'm surprised the grey wasn't called Greyhound, but otherwise, loving the collection!

Love this for you homie! As an avid nail expression enthusiasts, it's lovely to see more dudes also expressing themselves these days. Fun nails are for everyone! ☺... My absolute favorite shade is 'I'm live'. Also, congrats for you and Jenna! Yall are so good together. I loves her! This video gives me Aries energy for sure!. Lol 😆
Before the release I didn't think I would buy this, because I already have too many nail polishes, but this is such a great collection that it's already in my shopping cart :D great job
So proud of you Julien and I don't know you personally but I want all the best for you and Jenna. ❤️❤️❤️ I hope she knows how much she's loved and missed.
So happy for you🥹. I’ll never stop missing seeing you and Jenna together but I wish you both all the best♥️

HELLLLLLL YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAA
THIS IS NUTS!
YES THE WAITING FOR POLISH TO DRY IS BY FAR THE HARDEST THING I'VE HAD TO DO IN LIFE
The drying polish segment kills me 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
God I miss Aries kitchen
Your ring makes you look extra handsome 🥰
Love it
BEP BEP BRP Omg I missed that
UGH NOW IM DEBATING IF I SHOULD GET THE PACK OR JUST TWO COLORS SWXNUDNCUIRNCJIENJKCER
No Julien yellow????
so freaking cool bep bep!!
im sorry but seeing julien opening all the cabinets i immediately heard jenna's voice in my head JULIENNNNAAAH
O my fucking gawd! Yes 2 of my loved combined
That shot with all the cabinets open lmaoo
Lord have I missed the EH BEP BEP BEP BEP chaotically while you are in the kitchen 😂✨
this just made my day 🤍
Sooo… I’ve actually been meaning to order from Holo Taco for *FOREVER* now. My only issue thus far has been deciding exactly which polishes to pick up as there are sooooo many incredible options! And even though Cristine keeps everything priced _extremely_ fair, considering how high quality everything is, it’s still _waaaaay_ too easy for me to basically bankrupt myself due to wanting _sooooooo_ many of the amazing polishes! lol  So, naturally, as soon as I heard that Julen was doing a collaboration with Holo Taco, I knew what had to be done! LOL. I honestly didn’t even care what colors were gonna be in the set (Though I must say, I absolutely *LOVE* all 5 polishes!! Normally the purple would’ve been the only one I’d go for straight away, so I’m *hella* pumped to be getting 4 other *gorgeous* polishes that I wouldn’t have normally picked out on my own but that I genuinely really love! Plus, I don’t have anything currently like _any_ of them, including _I’m Live_ somehow! lol Also, 98% of my polishes are on the spectrum of “shitty to meh” in terms of quality, so I’m super excited to be adding _several_ new, *high quality* polishes to my collection!!  Anyway, my Holo Taco shopping adventure did _not_ end there! lol Not even close to it, in fact. After spending all of this time _thinking_ about buying from Holo Taco, combined with the fact that I’ve been doing *really* well saving money/watching my spending recently, AND the fact that my birthday is right around the corner (It’s on Monday, in fact!)… well, I went a little crazy! lol  After I’d successfully purchased the _Julien X Holo Taco_ set, I got back onto the website and _also_ ordered: _The Rainbow Bundle,_ _The Bold Rainbow Crème Bundle,_ _Electrostatic,_ _Rainbow Snow,_ _The Floor Is Guava,_ _Missed-Shift,_ _Encryption Key,_ _Cats’ Evasion,_ *AND* a bottle of _Flakie Holo Taco!!!_ lol  Sooooo… yeah, I think that I may’ve gone a bit overboard. lol And when I think about how much money I’ve spent on nail polish over the past 24 hours (Over $350! YIKES!!), well… it doesn’t feel too good!! However, I can currently afford it and it’s a great big birthday present to myself after a couple of pretty rough/shitty/barf years. lol (Plus, I’mma be set on nail polish for a hot ass minute!! lol) Once it all gets here, I’m sure any slight regrets I have will completely fade away and I’ll be right back to being 100% thrilled!! (I’m still pretty freaking pumped, TBH!) Especially for _Julien X Halo Taco!!!_ I can’t wait to do my nails with Julen’s set!!! Yay!!!
As a guy that loves to paint his I will definitely be buying and I will now dream of u painting my nails someday
I saw the announcement on fb originally and jumped at it! I am so excited! I haven’t actually bought any Halo Taco products before, but figured it was time to buy this collection along with some Halo basics!
oohmy fuckkinnn Gooaasshh THIS NEEDDSS TO BREAK THE INTERNET YALL
Yaaaaassss Julien!! 😍😍😍
Back when i was able to wear polish (can’t because food handling job/strict work policies) I would paint my nails in college/ high school right before i was supposed to sit down and write an essay. It would force me to stay at my keyboard and not do anything else but type because my nails were drying. Worked really well with my nail length and keyboard at the time
Congratulations on the nail polish 💅 Collab they all look great
What's up with the BepBep sweatshirt?
Two of the most genuine, kind, relatable people on the interwebs, working together to create beautiful things! Thank you Julen and Cristine! 😍🥲
Tell Jenna we miss her. 😥
Box of Chocolate: Boc. Julen plus Boc. Boc strikes again.
I love watching what you do in life over the years. You have had quite the journey since your very first youtube video. I hope you are all doing great. 💜 Definitely buying this!!!
this made me smile
Dude I saw your collab on Hasan's stream today!
So happy and proud 🥲 🥹  Never seen a better collab! 🥰
Hey man you can't just say "if you've been watching me...on Jenna's channel" I actually went and checked 😞
YES! I'VE BEEN WAITING
Need a Jenna X Christine Collab (all respect to Jenna for not wanting to be on camera and all disrespect to JULEN for wide nails)
How convenient I just started painting my own nails again 😌
I am so excited about this Collab!!! I love Julien and Cristine and Holo Taco!! THE BEST COLLAB OF THE YEAR BABY👶🏼!!!! ❤️❤️
Yesss! This is so awesome! Much proud, many happy 🤗
JULEN!!! CAN u help Christine with shipping prices to the UK cause they're like 3X time cost of the bottle. Sorry for yelling xx 😘
I miss Jenna 😭🥹☹️🥰
How dare you. I didn't even need to add to my nail polishes... and I was doing wonderful before that. Now I'm doing Greyt.
This collab makes me so happy
already ordered!
Julie’s a beutuber
LOVEE
He left the nail polishes open while his nails were drying. Someone get mom.
Guys,  I'm a little bias because I've been a fan of Cristine for years now but I LOVE Holo Taco!  I have some auto immune issues and an iron deficiency,  so my nails are not great.  They are thin,  brittle,  wouldn't last 2 days without chipping,  etc. HOWEVER!  Since March,  I have been using the Holo Taco base coat,  top coat,  glass nail file,  and jojoba oil.  I've had one or two nail polishes from Holo Taco but not what I just mentioned.   My nails have never looked and felt so good!  They are longer than ever,  stronger,  and don't chip for like 4 days even with scrubbing my bird's cage and dishes(without gloves).  It seems silly but its a real confidence booster when I do my nails🤗
Julien launching a nail polish..  Cristine wearing Juliens merch.. I love it
OKAY JULIE YOU POPPED OFF WITH THOSE COLORS YEAASSSSSS
SCREAMING the absolute best thing to happen in 2022
THIS IS SO ICONIC WHAT THE HECK OH MY GOD
That green is everything
F8cking Bad Bunny and his style creating trends to this extent.
Yooo thats so cool!!! I'm so proud of you!:D
Is marbles still alive
I remember my summer camp sending boys home for having their nails painted by girls when i was a kid and look how far we’ve come. Lets keep going, lol. The purple is sick
I love this! ❤️
jUlenn, you made it! You're a BEAUTUBER!!
I'm so pumped!!!  I knew this was going to happen one day!  Julen's Ratchet Salon is open for business!
yes. YES! This is amazing.
Have Cristine on next time!
His journey from not wanting Jenna to do his nails to loving it and always having it done is so sweet
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!!!
Afterfact of other previous comment…that purple seems kinda close to Twitch purple? Coincidence? I think not 😝 bepbepbepbep
Aw, congrats Julien!!! That's total brilliance! Men should be able to have colorful nails too!! Love it!
Holy shucks, man. I thought something Actually bad was happening. Do ya nails, beech. Also, can you spot me that $10 Peach owes me.
I met you on Tuesday at the Dodger game 😁💛👋 you're just as nice as you are in your videos.
Hi…so, to answer your question I found you through Jenna and you two together made me laugh so much which is great. I used to enjoy painting my own nails but recently with a new job regular nail polish flakes off too much too quickly so I got some dope gel cat eye nail polish atm. Magnets and stuff. I hope your dogs are doing well and I look forward to seeing awesome detailed wedding videos whenever that happens. Also, holo taco is some delicious nail polish. I love the holographic top coat aka tacos…anyway this is dope that you collabed with her. I definitely was not expecting this…I hope to see more cooking videos in the not so distant future. >>>Ideas Hot sauce? Salsa? Pickles? Beef Jerky? Whatever your fancy. Shalom and God Bless Ya Dude
When he was walking around the kitchen i was fully expecting him to jump on the counter lmaoo
ya boy just likes to paint OMG I JUST SPOILED MYSELF THE COLLAB WITH CRISTINE
🦵👁️🦶
I am beyond excited for you two! However, 18€ shipping cost to Europe are just too much for me at the moment :(
I’ve never bought anything from Halo Taco before. Always wanted to but the stuff I wanted was always sold out or limited edition. I did get to pick up Bep Bep Blue, I’m Live, and Greyt. I love the color choices. I hope you guys do another collab!
i’m so excited and i just miss julien on youtube so much
Congratulations on the launch! I love the colors, but the purple and the green are gorgeous!! 😊👏💯❤️
Where’s Jenna
Boi! Close the damn bottles! 😂
Omg that’s so cool I graduated yesterday lol
Love you Julie! Send love to Jenna I miss you two doing ridiculous stuff together 🥹
Yesss! This is awesome!
Why??? Why does he keep holding the bottle with the tips of his fingers 😂 i looked so harsh guy who is trying but still looks to awkward. I just ❤ him lol
So excited for you!! So much fun
Tell Jenna I say hi
“It’s just way more exciting than *not* painting your nails” I felt that in my soul. 😌 Can’t wait to get my box!!!
Yay Julie!!!!
I really need an aries kitchen video
God I love the claw energy Juli is giving with the “poses” 😂😂😂
Bold yet subtle, leaning a bit on the masculine side without being boring and dull. It looks cool as hell and I’m so excited to get my order! That bright purple especially is absolutely gorgeous!
IM SO HERE FOR THIS
I ordered mine already 😁 I can’t wait for them to come in!
is Jenna a active on any other social media ? I feel like an appearance is LONG overdue.
BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP!
Just placed my order ❤️❤️
So incredibly proud and happy for you. You deserve nothing but the best.
I WANTED THE "IM BISEXUAL" VIDEO FUCK 😂😂😂😂💅💅💅
omgg thats so amazing!! i love it and i want it
I like the skittles manicure title lol
I missed you so much
I'm so excited for this collab. Two of my favorite creators working together to create something magnificent. Can't wait to get my hands on these amazing colors. Simply × Julien: you nailed it.
Happy Birthday month to the 🐶 🐶🐶🐶❤️❤️❤️
Mazal Tov  So cool to see a male join this space  Love
Julien!  They look great!  Use a fast dry top coat and it will change your life.  Try Seche Vite. It dries in less than 5 minutes and makes it super glossy and smooth.  You can do your matte top coat over if you want later. But this speeds up your painting process so much!
I just know Jenna is so proud and excited for you Julen! Keep being you❤️
It was already spoiled. Y wait this long?????
So dope Julian! Happy for you!
Niceeeeee
NOW WHO’S THE BEAUTUBER
cristine teaching julien how to nail polish model was just that scene from Spongebob "FIRMLY GRASP IT IN YOUR HAND"
I don't know anything about you, but this gives me the heebie jeebies. California fruitcake. I'm done, and out.
NO ONE MAKES THIS GREEN ANYMORE! THANK YOU, JULIE!!!
A nail polish collection with men 🥹 I feel so seen
me throughout the whole video 😃😃😃😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
OMGGGGG AHHH
Hard to do the hand pose for sure. Just ordered Julien Nail Stickers, I'm Live, and Greyt.. catch the blind samurai with badass man paint on lemme knowww how you feel Haha 😄
i couldn't be prouder!! juuuulen this is absolutely amazing 🥳❤️❤️❤️
Omg I love all of the colors!
I feel so vulnerable when I express myself...in my case, when making a song, or more likely, laying down a few notes, discomfort sets in and I abandon the idea..
Listening you talk about things makes me emotional in a good way
you and harry styles are gonna bring so much power to the guys who wanna paint their nails 💗💗💗💗
You did it: I've been wanting to take the plunge into getting a HoloTaco bundle for a while. The I'm Live purple did me in. I've made my first purchase today! And I'm so excited!
Plzzz do a Julien Yellow in the next collection.
Literally my two fav YouTubers coming together 🥰I bought 4/5!
I’ve been trying to find a good purple shade for SO LONG,, thank you for this collab I love all of ‘em
Wow this was a great collaboration. I love the jewelry collection. My favorite colors were the purple, green, and the grey. Might be a great gift for my boyfriend.
Julien is looking so hot!!!
Did they officially get married 🥺👉👈
soooooo happy for you
Me checking in with my mental self awareness to avoid a panic attack: this is my table and I am sitting at it. I'm here ... at my table.
Yes! Bought it!! Also do you get married?
Flawless collab, Holo Taco never brings anything less than excellence!
OUR BOI MAN JULIE JUST DID THAT! A straight burly guy just launched nail polish! Julien, you are genuine, you're gold, you're the first in history and I don't care if your not really the first one. Tell Jenna iluvher.
Omg the GRAY is GORGEOUS!
OMG SO COOL!!!!❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
So excited for you!
Yayyyy very happy for you Julien, I was going to buy the collection but $63 is a bit much for me atm, but none the less so excited for this collab!!!
Beautiful packaging and the colors are so on brand for you and gorgeous! Congratulations, Julien! I hope I can get ahold of this collection!❤️
"You're clenching" 🤣
I bought it and I can't wait to get them and play with them! 💜
Congratulations Julien!!!!
This is so cool Julien!! I have tons of nail polish but I only ever end up using my Holo Taco polishes because I agree with you - they're the best polishes ever. Love your collection, just made my order! <3
They are all so beautiful and honestly it just makes me so happy for some reason to see him enjoying a hobby so much and having so much passion for it ♡ I'm surprised though that these weren't made to be quick drying for an Aries hehe
Just bought the collection, I’m so excited!!💚
What’s the shirt? Love ittttt need itttttt
This collab is awesome! Way to go to both ❤️❤️❤️
I love this so much
We all know that the day this all started was when Jenna put acrylic nails on him. Let's be honest. 😎💅🏼💪🏽
YESSIR
I was just gonna get one but now I want all them ahhh
Don't take my lunch money
Bought 3 of the colors as soon as it was available!! The website had me "wait in line" and I got so scared I couldn't get them for a minute. So excited and happy for you guys!! The first combo I'm doing is I'm Live with The Floor is Guava!!! They just seem like a fun Summer combo!! The green will match my eyes!!
I literally just bought ...bep bep blue and the purple one ..I support you bro so happy for you . also thank you for breaking gender norms my son loves your content and he's been wanting his nails painted but has been kind of wary about it ill show him this video It may help
Did anyone else get major tiger king vibes from the mustache/blonde mullet.....oooohh, shade name for the next collection, Blonde Mullet.
I loved this but the Aries energy is so strong when you’re holding glass bottles 😂
when are you getting breast implants bro? asking for a friend
I can imagine the wholesome joy of you and Jenna sitting together and paint each other's nails
Bought this so fast oml so happy I could get something that you put so much thought into, I’ve been watching you since middle school and I’m gonna flaunt these colors so hard. I’m gonna use this as motivation to stop biting my nails. So much love for you Julen! 🖤🖤🖤
congratulations! you did a fantastic job. I ordered right away!
ordered mind 🖤 this made me so happy, thank you for being you, julen 🥹
Pls tell Jenna I miss her ❤️
Congratulations!
1. AAAAAAAAAHHH this is so exciting!!!! Perfect partnership ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ maybe some bts banter Julen-Cristine? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 2. Julen can make a blonde mullet with bangs, a brown mustachio, hipster glasses, tattoos, pink buttoned down shirt and nail polish from his own nail polish collection. King 🤴🏻
Get a UV nail light!! That way you can dry them much faster than normal. I used to think they were only for gel polish, but then I realized that they use them at salons even when they don't use gel polish, so I tried my light at home and it totally worked!! And I got mine on Amazon for like $20. Or you can hold them in front of a fan, or a hair dryer on the cool setting. Cause no one ain't got the time and patience for that!! It takes so freaking long lol. And just like you said, if you do ANYTHING then your nails will totally be messed up. I swear I've had to restart my nails so many times just because I did something simple like get a drink, or looked at my phone.
Ehp, bep, bep, be-lue! So awesome!
1) already bought it. 2) WHERE IS THE JULEN YELLOW
Haha the brown thumb joke had me 😂
For your nail drying needs: OPI has a product called “drop dry” and you just drop a couple of these tear dropper drops on them and the nail polish dries In half the time at least! It’s magic and I can’t do my nails without it now. Also, congratulations on the collab!! So happy for you!
I struggle to convince myself to buy things without waiting a day or two but I bought this as soon as you showed the box I’m so so so proud of Julien!!!
please paint cerment's nails
This is up there with the Jimmy Timmy Power Hour.
As a lifelong lover of nail polish (and all things beauty),it makes me really happy to see men get to discover that joy. My 11 year old  son used to enjoy me painting his nails when he was little. He's not interested anymore but it was fun while it lasted.  EVERYONE should know the fun of expressing yourself with nail polish who wants to! Congratulations on your collaboration! It looks so awesome! The colors are beautiful!
NO BECAUSE TELL ME WHY I JUST BOUGHT FROM HER STORE LAST WEEK AFTER WATCHING YOU DRINK YOUTUBER ALC NOW I HAVE TO PAY SHIPPING TWICE love you though and so happy this exists please take my money
This is so cool!!!! I love the color selection ♥️ it’s awesome!!!!
I cant believe holo taco collabed with tiger king
Bro i seriously love this color story like 🤤 I’m watching this at 11 pm so I was happy it wasn’t sold out and I got one. HoloTaco is also the only nail polish I use.
Congrats on the collab julien, I so seen this coming lol I’d be sad if it never did. Wish I could get the collection but this girl gotta save her moola for the baby boy I’m having in August, idk might have to get some polishes since I’m bored and on bed rest due to health issues but happy baby is doing good. I love how I just rant on different stuff lol anyways congrats I’m sure it will sell out. 💜🖤🤘🏼😊 the purple is my fave and green I’d so rock those shades
you have such a big house
Y’all would break the internet if y’all make a video together and it would be the best thing to go viral since the invention of hugging
Julien is giving 80s vibes and I'm here for it!
Congrats 🎊
Bringing honor to Jenna’s ratchet salon 💇‍♀️
I have never really bought anything from any of the influencers I support, mainly because I'm a broke college student lol. But I started watching you on Jenna's channel (I hope she is doing well :) ) and I've been following you and watching you as much as I can even now. I am truly honored to be able to support you and your collab. I'm so happy for you and Jenna and I have never been so excited to get something from an influencer. I can't put into words how much your content has helped me with my anxiety, I have  a hard time sleeping sometimes and putting on your stream or videos helps chill me out with your plants, dogs, and just overall calming vibe. I can't wait to get my box and use the polishes. Thank you thank you thank you. All the love to you and your family. :)
This will too work for me Julien as I too have wide nails. So thanks.
I’m sorry but why have I never noticed how beautiful your hands are?
So what’s jenna been doing for the past years? If she use to stream, game or makeup YouTube videos. What’s she been doing?
You have a very tiger king vibe going on right now and honestly I’m here for it
So much free serotonin in one video.
You have girl hands.
THISBIS SO COOL
👏
♥️♥️♥️♥️
As I’m watching it I was feeling Christine’s vibe…. THEN I SAW HER COMMENT! Congrats to you both!!!!
time to EH BEP BEP BEP BEP my way to getting this collab once im paid next week, this is a godly collab and I absolutely ADORE these shades
I absolutely LOVEEE these colors!!! You never see see them and especially together. For sure going to try and get them!
Beyond excited to get my Julien x HT collection box! The launch was crazy fun. Chat was insane and I loved it. Menchie Gang Bep Bep Bep!
Ugh…. A video to advertise no
Not even 7 min in and already ordered the full collection for my wife!
You guys should’ve made bigger julen hand bottles!
aaaand they all go together
HUGE congratulations!!!!!!!
The collab we didn’t know we needed
I thought 'here you grow' was like a nice little cute motivational message about expressing yourself etc, but then he just said "here you grow" like 'here you go' and its much more on brand like that
I have ruined my and my boyfriend's eardrums screaming please be a Holo Taco collab
Julie! I'm so proud of you! Now gimme!
Right! I’m a masculine guy in Oklahoma but I love painting my nails and enjoy it, and I don’t think it’s gay. I think a dude that rocks it is cool and more confident, and wish it was that way here! It’s just fun and cool! I love it man!! ❤️
The colors are really good!! And the metalic gray one looks incredible!! Congratulations on this collab.
When did he turn into a porn star?
YES
He said, painting inside the lines🤣🤣🤣 i chuckled
Love it all, very sweet and wholesome even if it wasn't the intended effect of the video. Wonderful colors, love the box and sticker drawings so much.
I love that she made sure to tell Julien not to drink the nail polish lol 😂😂
HELL YES JULEN!
Love you both, but gosh I miss Jenna and her bubbly, authentic, kind, funny, positive self ❤️❤️❤️
I ordered mine today. Can't wait to see what you put together for us!!
julien’s only step in his moustache routine is putting a coat of ‘magical moustache’ over it in the morning
So great for you. I miss JENNA
😱😱😱😱😱 My reaction to seeing Holo Taco nail collab with Julian. And then actually seeing Cristine in the video. ♥️♥️♥️
IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY!
Greyt is down under LOL
DUDEEEE this is SO cool, congrats!!!!!! Totally checking them out
the comment about the ring 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥹🥹🥹
Ahhh I wish I could order 😫 I need I'm Live, it is my favorite color
It why does Julian look like the tiger king???????!!!!!
Congrats! Your colors are gorgeous, you did a beautiful job!
This video is such Aires energy.  It’s like Julien in the kitchen with Jenna.  Congrats on the collab and may the blessings flow.
Most realistic nail tutorial ever. The drying is the hardest part
Now Cristine understands Jenna’s pain😂😂 *aries activities*
Ran and purchased as soon as you said it was with holo taco. Didn't need to see anything! Lol 2 of my favorite YouTubers and my absolute favorite nail polish brand. So happy for ya!
wow look at blonde over here, i see  new ink on your arm, miss your cooking shows
Living for my besties collabing !! Jenna would be so proud !
Congratulations Julien! This whole video made me miss Jenna even more 😢
You’re wearing a wedding band Julen!!  Is it done ? Did you do it ? 😳😳♥️
Just ordered the blue and purple. I'm so excited
Julien's fingers can not manage the same position that the lady can manage because his hands and fingers are so much bigger than hers lol
I've painted my little dudes nails when they ask, usually when I am painting mine. No shame in expressing yourself, no matter what that looks like. 👏👏
I like the colors!
Ahhhh!  Two of my favorite peeps!  Seriously though, Julien, I love the style and feel of your videos and I’m gonna love the polishes just as much!
My boyfriend has been experimenting with nail color, and every week he goes over to my collection and picks out a new color for me to paint on his nails ❤️ I love doing it for him, his favorite color is way back chrome
How is Jenna? I miss her :(
He’s become the ultimate hipster
I didn’t even recognize him lol
A bonafide Beautuber in the house WATCH OUT Harry Styles here comes JULEN!!!!!!!
I bought the pack 😭 I’m so excited!!!
Fantastic colours and great stickers too, an all round beautiful set of bep bep bep polish fo' yo' fingernails!!!
I know I'll get hate for this comment but it's been really depressing watching Julien lose his masculinity to veganism. It's not the pink shirt or the hair either so don't get it twisted, he literally looks like a different person and so feminine compared to the past. This happens to most vegan men and I hate to see it.   If you truly feel healthy keep doing your thing but don't continue for the public if you're suffering. You look sick.
Congratulations!! I love that Christine chose you to do a collab with. You are such a wonderfully genuine human, and so are Ben and Christine. This is everything!
Love ya and the collection, happy for ya but I can't get over the fact that u look like the killer from The lovely bones. Lol
I my be getting old her, but this was unthinkable 10 years ago. I would have thought it was a joke if a guy used nail polish. But WAY NOT! It’s amazing, I have no idea who you are but seeing you with all the tattoos, and a pink shirt. I straight away though “ of course everyone can use nail polish” it’s just another way of expressing your self.  I just needed some make me see the connection. Som years ago I set at a table with my kindy kids (4-5 years old) one boy got teased by the girls for playing dolls with his sisters at home. I asked all the kids way the girls could play with cars, climb trees, run, play dress up and family, but the boys had limited and could only play boy game and wear boy clothes. It gave them and some of the stuff something to think about.  Thanks you for being you!
Julien could take pictures with dirty, bloody nails & id still be like, 🙀he’s so cool, I want whatever he’s buying.
This video was absolutely precious, yall play off of each other so nicely! I picked up I'm Live and the stickers. I know I'd never wear the other colors and couldnt justify it to myself...but im so excited to have any of it at all period! Thank you Cristine for making us dinks very happy!
not me going back to other podcasts to see him wearing the polish all sneaky!!
JULIE IS A BEAUTUBER!!! IT'S OFFICIAL
Julien is my favorite internet uncle
Just bought Bep Bep Blue and Monstera!
The blue is super cuteeee and great for spring/ summer . All of them are cute honestly !
I'm so excited for this!! Can't wait!!
I'm with you! LOVE that purple. Definitely going to get this and give my nails some love. I'm a massage therapist, so we don't get to do this often.
AHHHHHHH!
How are you not a clip from the mid 80’s ? Jesus Christ, you look like a Soul Train regular, lol!!!
I knew you were wearing Holo taco but I never saw this coming!
That purple is INCREDIBLE ❤
The serotonin this video and collab has giving me and continues to do so when I think of it is 😘🤌🏻 THANK YOU,  and CONGRATULATIONS!!! EH BEP👏🏻 BEP👏🏻 BEP👏🏻 BEP👏🏻 BEP 👏🏻BEP👏🏻 BEP👏🏻 BEP👏🏻 BEP👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I wanna hit Monstera with the Celestial lights topper…. Ugh. I need. Lol
I like the 60 second ones...
Can you tell me that Julien song? I've been trying to find it. GTA has a song that makes me think about it and reminds me of it..
I see that ring! Does that mean you guys got married?
That's so Aries of you! Love it! Please don't go away. I miss Jenna.. Can't lose you too..
Get a nail dryer my friend so you don't have to wait! XO 💞
I feel like I’ve seen a lot more straight men proudly painting their nails in recent years and it makes me SO. HAPPY. You guys should get to enjoy pretty nails too.
I'm so glad to see Julien does *exactly* what I do when I'm waiting for my nails to dry lmao 😂😂 I'm so happy for this collab! I love holotaco, I hope I can pick some of the stuff up before it sells out but I also have no money to spend 😭
Any other ADHDers really relating to the struggle of doing nothing while your nails dry?
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY HI!!!! IM SO HAPPY AND EXCITED FOR YOU
No black 🖤?
Basically I just wanted them to work for me so if they work for you that's a bonus
I’ve been dying for a dark green creme, Monstera is mine!!!
Congrats!! 🥳🥳
Love your work juulinn
I love your box! I'm so excited to get mine! I love the green! I'm live is the perfect shade of purple!
I love the monstera color! Speaking of - do you still have 100+ house plants?
julien has changed so much over the years i’ve watched him and it’s just so amazing to see him express himself the ways he does now.
I was at work when it launched but gave my mom my info to order it for me! I’m so excited to get it in the mail! I love you and Cristine both so much! The colors are all so amazing! They suit you so well and the quality of Holo Taco is unreal so the collab is just 😍 I’m so happy for you!  Edit: cracking up and Cristine ‘don’t stop breathing!’ 😂
What happened to Julien!? Is he channeling Tiger King??
These colors are SO pretty and they look really really good together,, good job Julen!!
I’m overly amped for the green and brown
This while video is just julien being an Aries
Oh this makes me SO happy! YAY!
Congratulations  Julien!
I’m so so proud🥺
off topic but ur hair looks amazin
Me thinking this was in the works since they were on the same table at Safiya's wedding
So cute, so cool, always impressed!
I GOT BEP BEP BLUE BC ITS MY FAV SHADE OF BLUE AND MY FAV RUNNING JOKE WITH YOUR CHANEL AND MONSTERA BC I LIKE PLANTS
These are so cute! The pausing “do you know anyone who can help me” gave me Blues clues vibes lol If people don’t send you pics holding all 5 bottles in one hand I’ll be upset 🤣
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OMG HE'S AN OFFICIAL BEUTUBER! Seriously though, this warmed my heart to be back at the JennaJulien kitchen table of craft/self expression watching Julie paint his nails and talk about his accomplishments. Yay Julie! So proud of you!
Bitch ur kidding me !!!oh my god don’t play w me rn✨I just got mine done as of ten minutes ago 😌we are all on the same wavelength. happy Friday y’all ✅💅
Love the green 💚
Thought you were announcing a baby... but this is just as cool and ur own baby
No freaking way.
Rumor has it there is an actual Julen mustache hair in each bottle of magical mustache.
I miss jenna
I literally do not have the faintest idea who this guy is/why this video showed up on my recommended but good for you dude!! Nice mullet!!
Julien: "Do you know who?" Me: "JENNA"
I can hear Jenna ... far away..... crying laughing watching Julen and saying JULIENNN... 😂
Wow, a collab with some of the best creators online! I would not have predicted this one but love seeing it 💜 Great colors!
Oh Julie has bi husband energy
Love them!!! 💛, but can we see them on acrilic nails 👀😏 IYKYK, congrats Julen they look amazing!
I freaking love this character upgrade !! Amazing I love seeing your nails painted no these colours are very you !
It’s been fun seeing the expressive evolution of Julien over the years
Wahhhhhhhhhhtttttttttt 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
As soon as you said you’ve been working on a collab and it’d be out June 3rd I immediately bought some
The only explanation I have for why you're on the top of my youtube homepage is because of the connection to Simply Nailogical. I was very confused.
Congrats! You truly looked so happy when you introduced your holo taco box!
IM BUYING THESE AS SOON AS IM PAID YO IM HYPED
It ALMOST felt like Jenna was here for a min 🥹
I have to get Bep Bep Blue!! Keep expressing yourself in every way that appeals to you
So excited. Holo taco is the only nail polish brand I use. Made it 2:59 into this video before I had to pause and go purchase this set. Can't wait to get it in the mail. 😆
This is a truly worthwhile product collab 😍
Ordered Monstera and I’m live for my hubbie! 🖤 congrats Julien
I love this so much!!! Congrats Julen!!!
I frickin’ love this, Julien! Way to go.
Waiting for them to dry is just me testing my patience 🙃
no judging just supporting:’) ehhh bep bep
I cried seeing marbles in the background of the pic with the Gatorade (for Jenna’s basketball game tomorrow)
I am so excited!! Just placed my order 🥹
Beautiful colors 😍😍😍 happy for the first colab 🥳🥳🥳
collab of the century!! ❤❤
I miss this kind of content from you 😍😍😍
That’s so awesome!!! I love Holo Taco! They make the best nail polish EVER!!!
JULEN IS A BEAUTUBER
I love this so much! You guys have always been so supportive of each other, I'm so glad you were able to finally collab!!
Gorgeous colours. Ive been enabling my 14 yr old nephew express himself with nail polish and makeup. I even helped him come out to the family this last Christmas. Since then he has truly grown into his person now he knows we all support him being himself.
Groovy colors and congrats on the collab, Julien! :)  Also... Missing Jenna bad these days. Will you give her a (platonic) fan hug from me (just a random fan) ... and also hugs for the pups! :) Thanks.
As an OG vlog watcher I need to see all your old hair colors in a nail polish collection! Those magical neons though!!!!
I love it already
this is great, Julien!!! i picked up a bottle of Greyt and Monstera! 💕
That green shade is chefs kiss
Aw, Julie, those colors are so you. I love this. Congrats :) <3
So very proud of you dad 🥹
Omg the inside of the box!
Tell Jenna we miss her and love her.  :(
Hey Julien I saw you have a fern tattoo! We have heaps of native ferns here in New Zealand and it's cool to see you representing one! Whether it's for fun or if there's more to it! P.s love the nailpolish! From a Kiwi 🇳🇿
Okay but like.. where can i get the bep bep hoodie christine has? Will there be a restock? Cuz i have plant energy, now i need aries energy
JULENNNNN ♡ wish more creators would do wholesome shit like this. Like julen likes painting his nails >> julen likes simply nailogical >> they both feel humbled and collab together out of their shared love of nailpolish >> julen gets to do something he always wanted >> they both benefit.  Vs two huge content creators collabing ONLY because they want to make more money...  Julen wants to share this for the pure love of being able to share something with us that he worked really hard on and is really proud of 👏 👏 👏   Some people like tana etc just pump out garbage just to scam/ make money.   Love humble passionate authentic creators.   Julens excitement is so sweet
The way I was counting down the hours and snatched that shit so quick
Safiya and Tyler are high-fiving because you met at their wedding.  I just bought my set!  Also, is Julien’s necklace Stormbreaker? Because that is awesome.
My Virgo ass stressing the Aries leaving the bottles open in between coats 🫣
I love this. I haven’t smiled in a moment for myself and this actually made me feel happy feelings inside 🤍 proud for Julie & Cris ❤️ y’all did good
Dude I’ve been looking everywhere for that type of purple!!! 💜 I’m obsessed.
Christine being a whole hand model while buff Julien is cramping up because he's a 31 year old ladaaaay 🌈
The names are awesome 😂
Love you Julien! ❤️
LOVE these colors! Honestly the green is amazing??? You don’t find a lot of good green nail polish — bought an extra one for my little sister 🥰
What a beta male.
I am so proud. Beyond. 🥹
I want these so bad
🎉🎉🎉 congrats you guys 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹 so happy for all of you!! we appreciate you and all you do ❤
WHAT??? Male nails and no "Just kidding we're pregnant!"?
Gosh, I wish I could get these but shipping to my country is probably really expensive and I'm poor lol. Best of wishes and luck to you though! I love you
Excited for you! Hope you, Jenna and all the doggos are doing well 🙂
I love the colors
I miss Jenna… ❤️
Aaaahhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
I love this! My 9 year old has showed interest in painting his nails and it's nice to have someone he looks up to show it's okay for boys to paint their nails. Thank you for being you!!❤
Wooop 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I Love this so much and I am so happy for you and proud of you!!!
THOSE COLORS ARE SO NICEEEE BUT O DONT USE NAIL POLISH
IM SO FUCKING EXCITED JULIIIIIE!!!! U DID IT TO ALL OF EM
I love you guys so much and miss Jenna with all my heart. I’m happy for both of y’all and hope y’all are doing great! God bless y’all!!!
Julien your entire aesthetic is just 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽 I love this for you. 10/10 will  buy these nail colors stat
That ring though 😍 💍
Omg I fucking WISH I could get these! I can’t afford :( 😭😭😭😭
Bruh if I wasn't financially ruined rn, I would be snatching that Monstera polish faster than a blink. Congrats y'all, this looks AMAZING~
OMG! iM INTO IT JUULEN!
Got confused about the launch time, thank goodness there was enough left for me to get a box today!
Already grabbed Bep Bep Blue and I'm Live! 💜💙
Wait .. I’ve been out of touch, are they married otters?  Congratulations! It’s so cool how you e turned your creativity into a tangible object and the colors are so neat! Purple and green are my faves! I’ll be getting em!
My fave name is Bep Bep Blue
So awesome!!!!
Julien you're dead right, painting nails is cool man 💅
love it!!!!!!!!!!
Omfg no way!!!!
My husband was getting regular Pedicure before the Princess Padme happened.  I got the drop today and can't wait for us to go back to getting pedis together.🦄💅
Julien waiting for his nails to dry is the most accurate representation of my ADHD I’ve seen 😂 Congrats Julie, I’ve been watching since your first vlog and I’m so excited for you 💕
I LOVE HOLO TACO but a collab with Julien? How could anything get better! This is the promotion the brand deserves, normalizing it not being a gender activity and who's better than this lovely being? 🥰
I see no mention of this unscippable 3 minute ad for volcanoe lovers?
cant even begin to express how excited i am for this, congrats julen and cristine!!
I love this friendship!!
I can imagine how many times Jenna told Julien that she wanted her own holo taco shade/collection 😆  I’m super excited for this 😍
I spy Kermit!💕💕
This was too cute! I love how excited the both of you are to work with each other!  Also leaving all the cabinet doors open must be an Aries thing, because I do it too XD
I love this so much  ❤️‍🔥
Where is Jenna Marbles??!! What did you do with her?
Did they just bully us with their nails? They look so good
My little Aries heart is so happy for this collab! 😌🤌🏼🎉
Im done. This is the best vid ever. Thank you for setting the bar so high for my future boyfriends
9:41 omg that metallic grey is to DIE FOR
That green is gorgeous! I’m gonna have to snag it.   Congrats on such a cool collection, Julien and Christine!
Julien. Julen. Eh bep bep bep. Genuine question. Can I get a tattoo of a monstera leaf that is on the box? They are so pretty! It isn’t enough to have the polish! 💚🖤🤍💚
i usually just choose 1-2 holo taco polishes per set but i guess i found the first full set im getting :')
Remember when julen was a basketball shorts gym bro .
This is crazy, my hubby asked me to paint his nails today out of nowhere. I was so excited i went and got all the polish and now he has a better manicure than me. Now this came up in my notifications.
17:55 The Aries energy has found a new victim.
YES!!!!! I love it so much!!
This video warmed my whole heart. 🥺
Just ordered! So excited for you both!!
This is so beyond cool I’m pumped! Congrats to you and cristine for such a banger collab 💖
It makes sense. I never expected this collab but I'm very glad it happened. The colors are all very earthy. The silver and purple are like spacey so the vibe to me is Planet Earth in Space. Which is pretty rad.
What a perfect collaboration!🎉❤ I lovvee this!
That Monstera is a whole vibe in itself! 💚💚💚
As someone who never has naked nails and loves doing nail art, these colours are SEXY
Who told you pickle juice helps cramps..? 😂🥰
Love this collab of YouTube icons, looks like a great product. Hooray for independent creators and for normalizing nail polish for everyone 💅
Omg I missed silly julen 🥹 can’t wait to get mine!!!
Just another thing guts can't do lol
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! I love the entire color range. Great job Julen!! & Halo Taco!!
You ever paint your nails and then have to take a poo?
I got Bob Ross/Mr. Rogers/Julien vibes from this and I’m in love
Just got me mine!  So looking forward to the delivery
I'm so excited and I happy for you!
Julen is THE beauty guru
Next time we need a Julien yellow!!
Watching this painting my nails, also that purple reminds me of Jenna ❤️ I’m so happy for you Julien!!!!
YOU DIDNT CALL IT THE JULIAN SOLO HOLO COLLECTION?
all of these colors are so perfect omg
Yay for Australian representation? I guess I'll have to buy that one 😂😜
How dare you break into Jenna's ratchet salon and do ur own nails! ..lol Love it!!!
If it’s not a baby announcement I don’t care
so incredibly happy for u julen🥹!!! definitely getting I’m Live
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU JULIEN WILL DEFINITELY BE GETTING !!!!
this makes me so happy edit: no shipping to my country, so a little less happy
Omg I needed this video. Julien's pure joy always makes me feel better. Him and Cris were too funny. 🤣 Thanks guys for this collab
AAAAAAAA I love you both so much and this is the collab that NEEDED to happen!! 💚💚💚💚
Miss you Jenna ❤️ Uh Love u Julien lol
after my paycheck hits you know I'm getting this collection <3
Getting the blue!
I love y'all 😭😭 this makes me happy
Wow julllieeee. You’re a LOOOK 🥰💕🤗
I JUST BOUGHT MINE!!! EH BEP BEP BEP!!! 💥💥💥 My two favs collaborated!!! I can die in peace🥹🫶🏽 🫶🏽💜💜
I'm definitely buying these. All the colors are awesome. ❤️
The colors are beautiful! Congrats on the collection. I was dying when with the posing, you two are hilarious.
Thought Julien was coming out bi or something sorry it's pride month
IVE BEEN SO ATOJED FOR THIS OMG OMG ALL DAYYYY
I miss jenna :(
See this is how you do a collab. Unlike Shane, Julien actually was interested in nail polish and painted his nails way before this collab. Shane wasn’t even “interested” in makeup when that palette got released. This feels so much more genuine and you can tell he’s actually so proud of it.
dope colors  and this whole endeavor exudes non-toxic masculinity. we love to see it
I bought it ❤❤❤
Dude! I love every color!!!!!
I could hear Jenna yelling his name as he was opening all the cabinets in the kitchen lmaooo
I live in Ireland and have only ordered Holo Taco because it’s the best nail polish I’ve ever used! I’m delighted that you have collaborated because omg my worlds are brought together 😂 I love it 🥰
You a beauty guru!!!!
😂😂😂😂I love julien and I can’t wait for Jena to come back ❤️❤️
I love how she's so serious about not dropping the nail polish
am i losing it or is that a wedding ring?? did i miss something?
"Don't be done breathing" hell yeah christine
I LOVE BROWN AND BLUE AND I'M TOTALLY BUYING THESE BEEBEEEEEEEE  And I rarely paint my nails. Maybe that's going to change.
Julian is a human manifestation of my inside brain
That axe necklace SHEEESH
I am so excited for this collab and kept wanting Jenna to yell “Heeellllll Yea boil!!” from the distance even though i knew it wasn’t going to happen. Love to you all!
Does Jenna have a new channel.
Yay!!! Love this collab ❤
How exciting julen!!!!
Sir, is that a wedding ring? Did I miss something?
If she put a ring on it…does that mean that y’all got married?
I ordered so fucking quick!! I don’t even really wear nail polish but these colors are actually what I would wear, and I just had to support two of my all time fave creators. So happy for you Julen!!!
That’s a big ahh kitchen 😍😍😍
I love the brown and the purple 💜 😍
Love your videos but my favourite video of all is cermit got paint on your table. He's such a nasty boy
Congratulations! Cool packaging! Cool colors! Ermmmm ARE YOU MARRIED YET? Dat ring! Congrats!
This is the best thing ever.
Well done Julian, this is awesome
True Aries energy in the kitchen while waiting on the dry by opening and leaving open every cabinet 🤣❤️
OMGGGG JULIEN
It’s after launch time so I panicked, paused the video, and ran to look. Grabbed monstera! Have a wedding in August and that’s the color we are using! It’ll match beautifully! Congrats.
I bought some before the video even finished. love you julen and thank you for expressing yourself so loudly🕺 this is EVERYTHING
I love the colors!!!
Julen I know I’m just some internet person, but please for me just let jenna know that I miss her and seeing her content. I miss the ratchet salon and everything else she contributed to the internet. I’ll forever hold her in a special place in my heart. I just really hope that one day soon she will be able to return to the internet machine. I am truly struggling without her. I love you both so much💙
My fav people on the YouTube’s! So happy for you two!! BUT 11:31…. Real dick move.. we miss you Jenna💔😭
Love seeing two of my favorite people together......🙂
I love everything about this ❤️😊
Seems more like an M&M manicure. Don't know of any brown skittles lol
Hi Julien! Missed y’all. Hi to Jenna n the doggies!
I just ordered my bundle! So excited!
Awww, this is so amazing!!! I remember Ben lightheartedly throwing out the idea of collabing with you years ago, quoting a potential color name of "Dink Pink", lol.
this is so incredible to see. i never paint my nails & still want to buy the whole collection
congratulations, Julien! i know i speak for everyone when I say we love seeing you express yourself in ways that make you happy and feel fulfilled. this brings me true joy during a rough week.
I JUST BOUGHT YOUR MERCH THEN U DROP THIS TAKE ALL MY MONEY JULIEEEEEN
OMG that blue is so pretty!! I wish I could afford it. Maybe when it's restocked. I love that you guys are doing this, two of my fave people on youtube coming together to make something so cool. I like the idea of further normalizing nail polish on men.
Wait......i just seen you're back on YouTube
Much love to the Dink and Holo Taco families!
This just makes me so happy,  the perfect collab!
julien there is no way you were actually trying for the nail poses. they were awful 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
JENNA
Are they already married? He’s wearing a ring
Congratulations! Thats cool! Kinda missing your cooming videos. Would love to see the odd random cooking upload when you feel like it. I love your vegan cooking.
I love that 'I'm Live' is the colour of the Twitch logo!!!!
Already purchased! 🎉🎉
You should consider going to school for nails it would be a fun career move
I just ordered mine. I am so proud. Bep bep bep
Did he come out of the closet? He looks so different?
Julien sending love to Jenna who is greatly missed, but totally understand, she is just the best <3 for Jenna
Julien went woke?
I knew it was a collab with Christine as soon as I saw the title omg!
10/10 BEPS 🤩
man i miss the scene phase of highschool where the whole gang would paint our nails and listen to emo. now everyone is married and starting to have kids and i hate it.
The second my sister told me about this I went "how do you make nailpolish chaotic?"
With peace and love... AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH😍
10:16 BIG aries energy lmao
Only slightly disappointed that I’m live wasn’t called come get y’all juice instead… so stoked for this collab though and can’t wait to get mine in the mail!
Me when my nails are drying for sure 😂
First off, not the sound effect in the video title 🤣 I don't know if I should be upset that it registered almost instantly and it's been months since I last heard you do it but now let me actually watch the video.  Edit: Aww heck yeah, nice nail polish! It's awesome! What a cool collab 😊
Julien, you're so adorable! These are amazing. <3
Surly he knows about her fast drying taco… come on Julian🤦‍♀️
I cried
OMG. That is the perfect green....
LOL I love that Julien is lovingly bugging Cristine instead of Jenna 🤌🤣
This is is so exciting and so well deserved. We love you Julen, official holo taco ambassador 😂🖤 can't wait for my box, I needed a purple in my collection!
Is that a wedding band 👀
This is so cool. Love this nail polish. I wish we could see Jenna too. I miss her so much.
This is amazing, I just got into doing my nails again and I used to be obsessed with simplynailogical when I was younger. Never thought I would see this collab and I am soo here for it! So much love for you julien !
i love how when julien can't hear the clap, he leans in closer, despite the fact that it's playing out of his airpods
Living for bep bep blue on principle lol
I’m so happy rn😭😭💕💕💕💕
MY TWO FAVS OMG
Ever since I saw the Cristine’s Tik Tok, I have been WAITINGGGG for this video!!
just ordered mine along with a base and top coat, and one-coat black! this is super awesome, i'm so happy for you julien :)
I have the bump on my thumb nails too, it think a lot of people have it cause of the amount we use our thumbs and the nail kinda gets bent over time!
I was definitely expecting Julien Yellow
Purchased before I finished the video! I love this!!!
Dope
masculine madonna
This is very exciting actually!!
IT WAS IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE CELEB ALCOHOL VIDEO?!?!???!?!??
The way I don’t like nail polish usually, but these are all colors that I genuinely do not see and have wanted to wear. Am I about to buy nail polish? I think I’m going to try.
This is like, basically the only creator for whom I'd buy their youtube collab. And Jenna. And it being Holo Taco bc they do make amazing polish.
Obsessed. Love this collab 💙
THE MOST ICONIC COLLABORATION ✨
Congratulations Julien and Christine! Love seeing two great YouTubers collab on something they’re both passionate about
Cristine shocked you with that question eh? Lol
No color for peach? No "do it em" ? No Aries season?  I love all these colors. They seem so you.  Maybe the next collection. 🤔
Your videos are always such a good vibe. Your energy is amazing. Congrats on the collab!! Shades are gorgeous
Yessss beeeeeeech! 🥳 *Jennas voice*
Julieeee!!! I’m so excited!!!! Ordered mine 🖤💜💙💚🤎

The way Julen opened all the cabinets and I IMMEDIATELY went “YOU BETTER CLOSE-“ and sighed when he did 😌 love these colors and I’m sooooo happy that he’s happy! 🥺
Painted nails are so lovely and colorful, they got me through many college exams and calmed me down a few times. I like painting other people's nails too. Don't be shy, live life in colour!
I have never missed a kitchen so much 🥹
Bought! So excited!!
Okay but the halo taco site name is genius lol
so proud and excited for you Julien. Snagged my collection set and CANNOT wait. Holo Taco got the best first collab 💙💅
Sitting around waiting for nails to dry is for the birds! next time make gel polishes for us gel heads!!😬🙏
Im so excited for this! The colors you chose look so cool
JULENN YOU ATE WITH THIS COLOR PALETTE!!! Not a want but a need !!
Gotta see them in aries' kitchen
The aries energy when posing with the bottles!!
With those amazing colours I would say Smarties more so than Skittles <3

Love love love!!! Bought it! I'm so excited to try them all!
Ordered the collection before I could finish the video!! I’m so proud and excited 🥹
Damn, I thought Jenna was preggers.

❤❤❤❤
we went from jenna doing you nails to you having this collab and wow, i’m so happy to have been here for the ride
I almost didn't recognize this was Julian , I thought this was like a back in the older days gay guy because that's what they exactly look like LMAO
oh purr!
Monstera is stunning and the stickers are darling - i ordered 2 sets 😃
julien I'm so glad you released a futch nail polish line just in time for gay pride!!!!!!!!!
10:23 - 10:29 Thanks Julien for reminding me to do my laundry! XD
Oh My God 😍😍😍 All my favorite colors in one collection.
when my nails are drying i just watch youtube for 5 minutes oh my god julien @ all the opened cupboards 🤦🏾‍♀🤦🏾‍♀🤦🏾‍♀🤦🏾‍♀
These colors are GORGE! And so Julien!! I love them 🥰🥰
After many years of being an apprentice at Jenna’s ratchet salon. Our Julie is a beautuber.
You should do more videos like this where you learn how someone else does something in their profession or something like that! This is one of my fave videos of you I’ve ever watched!! Congrats Julien!!! So cool 😊
He is driving her nuts 😂 love him
Enjoying The "Tiger King"  lewk ya got goin on.
Ok but where is jenna!?
YAY!! Sooo happy for you!!!!! 😍😍❤️
How did you not make a pad thai themed one?! Very happy for you, Julien.
Hetero Men who aren’t ashamed of painting their nails are true alphas 💅
That's wonderful :) Dreams can come true. Cute colors and fun names, I'm glad it's with Holo Taco, she has a really good formula and the colors are always cute.
Do I get my nails done professionally? Yes. Will I support JULEN any chance I get anyways? Also yes.
Man, this is so nice to see. Not only seeing cool people do cool stuff that's genuine and fulfilling, but also seeing how many others find comfort and validation in this form of self-expression (especially for folks who wouldn't be "allowed" to paint their nails in the past due to toxic expectations). And hearing about kids learning early to express themselves freely is the BEST.
I love love love this so much! Simply/ Cristine is a Canadian treasure!
lol i love watching simply try and rangle julien's chaotic energy
Been watching you and Cristine for years and knew this would happen one day! So cool! Congrats!
I was looking forward for this all day
Painting your nails is all about artistic and personal expression, and we shouldn't limit expression in the form of nail art to just one gender. It's good to see people with influence like Julien showing that they aren't afraid of change.
SHIIIIIIII
HELL YEAH JULIEN!!! THIS IS SO SICK! ❤️❤️❤️
Jenna HAS to be loving this!!!!!! Omg I’m so excited!!
The best collab to ever exist!!!!!!!!!!!
FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!
i love Cristine this is so exciting!
I love that I'm live color it makes my mouth water
Forever upset we’ll never get a JennaxSimplyNailogical collab
The other day one of my 5 year old student had his nails painted with watercolors and a boy said owww he is a girl he painted his nails, and I lost it.but I also educated him.lets educate our kids better
this video is so wholesome. we're so happy and proud of you Julien!! you look so happy 🥹
I read “here you grow” in Julien’s voice 😂
A bit off topic but my god I NEED to know where julien got that pink button down from. I WANT IT
Julien i appreciate you loving painting your nails! Nails without nail polish is boring, i myself will not have bare nails!  I love the collab! Yes Holo Taco is amazing!
HELL YEAH 🖤
No Aries???
AHHHH WE THOUGHT YOUR OWN ALCOHOL BUT NAIL POLISH?! IM SO DOWN!
I'm sure this is asked all the time but how's jenna? It's been so weird without her on YouTube, does she have plans to come back? What's she up to at the moment? I hope she's well and looking after herself
BEP BEP BLUE
I've had a $15 halo taco gift card for a year now and I'm so happy to have a perfect time to use it! Congrats!
Makes me smile. I’m happy to hear you talk about nails and what makes you happy
Congrats, Julen!!
Congratulations! Creativity is such a great process. I am so happy for your success! I love the Greyt color, and Monstera reminds me a bit of Nars polish Zulu. (I agree with you, no other nail polish comes close to the quality of Holo Taco. Not just saying.)
Whoooooo! So excited, did not know what this video was going to be about but I qm so excited for you! CONGRATULATIONS! (my set had been bought!)
Take a drink every time he says "nails"
Did anyone else get massive anxiety when he left the polish caps open while he waited for his nails to dry? Nope? Just me being Virgo? Oh ok bye.
CONGRATS JULEN!!! This is SO AMAZING and exciting!! Could not imagine a better collar for you other than this one!!!!! 😍😍😍
do some acrylics to bring back memories
I love watching the most Aries Aries trying to pose with these awesome nail polishes 😂🤟 FR tho, I love this, I love literally everything about this
how genuinely excited you seem is so heartwarming
I can imagine Jenna’s new “job title” being ✨Julian‘s manager✨
I can’t wait for the next box that includes Julien Yellow
Julien, do you have a tattoo of the ✨Debbie Machine✨?
Can we atleast see Jenna’s hand? With the paint please!!!! That’ll be goood enough I’d be so happy lol jus to see her hand
Side note: can you tell Jenna to please come back to YT we miss her
I was just bepbep-ing the other day in honour of you and Jenna. I don't do the twitch thing so I hope you're both well 🤍
Julie!! I'm impatient with nail drying too, I suggest a hair dryer on the cold setting to speed it up 😋
That was the shade of green I have been looking for and that purple! WOW WA WI WA🌟
Cool stuff.
That purple feels like the colour of my soul. Congrats to both you and Christine what an awesome work of art. 💜 Really looking forward to getting my order 💜
I love Julians hair here
BEP BEP BLUE B*TCH 💙💎🐬
Just bought the Green and brown 🥸🤌🏽 love ittttt
I love this! My nephew has recently started asking me to paint his nails, so its a hobby we share together every week painting his nails a different colour. He was worried at first that it wasn't a "boy" thing, but now he loves showing his nails off to people! Thank you for smashing the gender stereotypes Julien, the younger audience will love you for it 🖤
ARE U FUCKING KIDDING ME 😭😭😭😭😭✨❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I recognized bep bep blue from your celebrity alcohol tasting pt. 2 with Jason!!! Loved it ever since
Loved the little mini showcases of the colors at the end of the video- especially the Monstera with your hand 🤩✨
It's been a couple of years, a lot has changed O_O
love seeing Julien terrify Cristine with his Aries
Im looking at the website and  love the polish !!! But ok but where are juliens rings from 👀👀👀 anyone know ?
Im so excited about this!  I love both these humans and already eagerly support them both.  I could not be more happy about a purchase!  I will be getting the whole set if it's not already sold out. Congratulations on this collab!
9:58  Don’t think I’ve ever said someone had sexy fingers b4 But DAMN son 👴
I may have or not have missed something, but is he wearing a wedding band? If so, I'm so excited. If not that's fine. I love and miss him and Jenna on YouTube together
The energy of these two together.... I'm at a loss for words it's so warm, wholesome, and silly. Pure comfort. 💖😭 I'd love more of them together. This will be my first holo taco  purchase!
Just ordered, I cant believe two of my favourite creators made a polish collection together!! I usually don’t buy nail polish since I’m really bad about taking care of my nails, but I wanted to support you both so much and now is better than no time to start nail care and nail enhancement 😉
i have a bump on my thumb nails too. my mom did also. i know other ppl who do as well !
This collab makes me so happy! I literally bought the collection without looking a the shades cause i knew they would be 100% Julen 🥹
Why is he better at painting his nails than me 🥲
Dear julien so proud of you ❤️❤️❤️
Idk why but "Greyt" just sent me rolling on the floor 😂😂😂😂
YAY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU!! can’t wait to never wear another nail polish for the rest of my life (:
I just bought it bep bep squad
bep
Lahv it! 💜 Two of my favorite creators collaborating on one of my favorite things! 💅🏻 💿 🌮
The colors look so good !!! Especially all together I want to paint my nail just like that literally right now 😍
regarding the judging I was given permission to do: I would'a done lightest to darkest, starting at the thumbs. Thats all 💙💜💚🤎🖤
I would personally never where these colours together (you do you, boo), but HOLY FUCK they're all, like, the missing piece to any colour collection. Perfectly specific.
THE COLLAB WE NEEDED
DISNEY COMMERCIAL GTFO OF MY FACE BEP BOY IS BACK
You paint our souls with happiness homie!
WHAT
I just bought "I'm Live"! Loved the color, Julien!
I hope Jenna still scream laughs at you. I can hear it sometimes when I’m cracking up. Love you, congrats!!!!!!! 💛
Julien you are a light!
Just got it!!!! So happy😊
Best collab of 2022
i was hoping for something else, but congrats julie
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT FOREST GREEN FOR SO LONG! Ugh I can’t wait to COP
I CANNOT WAIT to rock the Monstera shade all the time. It’s my favorite in the collection.
This video is the essence of Julien. Same with the colours, they are very Julieny. Congrats both on the Collab!
CONGRATULATIONS JULENNN ❤️
This video made me smile, it was wonderful to see Cristine working with Julien! there was a small part of me though, watching Julien mess with her that reminded me of how he would mess with Jenna in her videos. It's a strange feeling, Almost like seeing a ghost. 15:51 - There's the smallest hint of a JULIEEEEEEN.
is that Jenna’s MOM on his arm?????
Can we get an update on Jenna marbles please
I DIDN’T KNOW I WANTED THESE BUT I NOW REALIZE I NEEDED THEM
When I tell you I audibly gasped 🥹 I’m so excited for you Julien. Thank you Simply Nailogical and Julien for giving us this collab! ❤
gahd I adore this boy
Don't forget that while you wait for your nails to try you ALWAYS have to pee. And you're always wearing like jeans.
Happy for you julien!! ❤️❤️ can't wait to see what happens next! Also, please tell Jenna we miss her 😔😔 and stroke the pups for us all here 🥰
in love with the green one :') im sadly im too poor to get it currently though, especially since uh shipping it to switzerland costs 20 bucks... almost twice the cost of the product, the european struggle
"Greyt is fine, he's good, Greyt is Australian!" XD Cristine was really facing some peak chaos Aries energy here
Darn, I was really hoping this was a Jenna pregnancy announcement.
Oh my goddddddd. I love both of youuuuu. I honestly don’t wear nail polish often so I never had a reason to buy holo taco. But now I neeeeed to get it! Just bought it <3 I’m so excited!!!
LITERALLY BUYING IT RIGHT MEEEEOOOOOW!!!!!!!
Congratulations!!
I need this in my life! I do my nails EVERY Sunday. Such a cool kit💋
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas 💅🏼
Julien genuinely has such pretty hands
I am so excited about the green and brown in particular. It’s so hard to find shades of each that I like, and these are absolutely perfect!
Omg!  Cristine and I have the same sweater! Living!
Yas! Holo
Literally the only nailpolish that I will buy and invest in and I love all of her shimmer and unicorn skin shades.
Congrats king!
They so are my favorite!!
the blue and purple are gorgeous and so vibrant!!
Julen what the hell one of these is a color I haven't been able to find with any brand for years and I am SO HAPPY
I actually started painting my nails somewhat recently like almost 2 years and mainly cause I saw how cool it looked on you
I’m so freaking excited!!!!!!
Can we watair the cermet? So he can grow?
HOLY SHIT HELL YEAH
Yes! Congratulations, Julien. I've been looking for a shade of green like Monsterra. It looks great.
TS 10:17 cold water makes it dry faster
My fiancé has been enjoying getting his nails painted lately, and I really appreciate as many people as possible sharing how it's okay to express yourself no matter who you are. I'm so happy for you, Julien, and it's people like you and Jenna who really brighten up this world and make me so proud to be here  :')
Why are half of these commenters calling Julien "Julen"? You know there's an "i" in his name right?
I loooooooveeeeeee this!!!
I can hear Jenna’s facial expression when you were complaining about having to wait for your nails to dry
Congratulations on yours & Simply Nailogical's collab 💅🏻 & success! 💅🏻🥳👍🏼🎉👏🏼
Oooo boy
Nailwerin. Just sain..
Do straight guys paint their nails now too, or is it only for gays?
I assume the hairstyle is much too exactly like tiger king for it to be accidental. Is that a troll with concerning devotion or is that something else.
Bep bep blue 😭
'I'm Live' was literally a color I was telling my partner I wanted, and now it exists!! I am so excited to use these colors on my entire life! GG
Omg I absolutely love this! And tell Jenna that we hope she’s practicing hard for her basketball game 🏀
I remember doing twin boys nails in elementary school. I was yelled at by their mom even tho they kept asking me to do their nails. I made lil smileys on them because it was that nail art kit advertised on the TV and I wanted to make friends
I laughed my ass off at you clenching the bottle like you don’t have opposable thumbs 😂😂😂
LOVE THIS SO MUCH
I want my hair to be that shade of green 😍
So cool for you Julien
It's really cool to see a holo taco collection with more "masculine" colour palette, the colors are super pretty but they also scream JULIEN!
“If it works for you, that’s just a bonus” the energy I aspire to have about anything and everything
Was really hoping that the grey shade would be named Nasty Boy but the name is pretty great too.
i have the bump on my thumbnail too🫣
Okay so you two are a fun vibe! More video collabs plz 👯‍♀️
THAT GREEN COLORRRR so niceeee the blue tooo
This is so wholesome I love it
You had to say grapefruit. The one fruit i can't have for 6 months while on blood thinners after a clot in my fractured leg....check your legs when injured and still people
Juliennnnnn Congratulations 🎊🎈🍾🎉 you absolutely deserve all the blessings you’re receiving. How dare you not make Julien yellow    Tell Jenna I miss her and the dogs so much!
Congrats Man!! That is amazing. So happy for you and the ability to express all of you!
I DIDNT EVEN FINISH THE SENTENCE ANNOUNCING YOU CAME OUT WITH IT AND SQUEALED AND RUSHED TO THE WEBSITE. I am SO excited for you Julien the colors are absolutely stunning and I can’t wait to have them in my hands 🥰🥰  Can’t think of a better way to spend my first paycheck post-graduation!!! CONGRATS 💕💕
tbh i thought you were coming out when i read the title😭😭BUT IM SO EXCITED FOR YOUUU
i never painted my nails because my nails are pretty short and wide so i thought it looked funny, but being a fan of both julien and simply/holo taco... i had to buy this 😌 plus i got to see them swatched on julien's hand which made me think maybe it'll be okay with my nails 🥲
That is not Jenna 😑 I couldn’t help but remember the 100 layers of polish and Jenna raving about holo taco :( When u called for an assistant I was so expecting Jenna.
I think u accidentally put Eddy Burback in your nail polish box 😂😋 For real this is cool. I love this for you, and I love this for us. Doesn't get any better than Holo Taco for Nail Polish. Video was hilarious. I love how a dude has a nail collection. By that I mean a dude, who doesn't have some perfect, long fake nails, like James Charles, but a normal dude like Julien, with his semi short nails, non perfect painting, and doesn't know how to pose his hands. Julien represents most of us out here. Men & women. Not perfect at painting nails, lots of clean up. Lots of needed help. Way to be super relatable Julien.
Painting your nails is always so therapeutic! Congrats on the collab!
Cristine working with Juliens' antics with whichJenna has to go on everyday for last few years is absolutely hillarious <3  -Don't drop the bottle *drops the bottle*
I loooooveee this, shades are sick Juilien! So happy more men are wearing nail polish now, it is fun and makes your nails look mad
It's crazy... Cristine gave me Jenna vibes😅  Julien good job on collab🤞
I have yet to meet an Aries i don’t adore.
This is awesome!! 💜
This made my whole day!!!!!!
AYYY BEP BEP BEP
Ooooo
Julien... Ive been looking for a good forest green forever. Its my favorite colour. I barely use nail polish but i need that ond
purpleeeeee
We have to get a Julien yellow in the next collab!!! 💕
The title suggested this might have been a different announcement video…
Watching your tattoos evolve is just watching Julien slowly become the punk edit irl 😜 and your nails have always been awesome
Cristine dealing with Aries Julien…. Hilarious.
The struggle of waiting for nails to dry is so difficult 😂
Love this collab and these humans!!
Ha ha that’s so me paint my nails and decide I need to laundry or go to the store and try to dig my keys out of my purse!🫠
I literally sat down to do my nails and didn’t know this was a nail video  So weird
I'm not usually much of a brown girl, but that Magical Mustache though... 👀
I fully expected you to be coming out as non-binary/queer just from the thumbnail and the intro ha ha! love the nail polish drop tho 💯
I actually cried. This is so wholesome. The only YouTube Collaboration that makes sense.
I miss Jenna so much. Hope that one day she’ll jump in front of the camera again 😄
THE INTROOOOOO
The box is stunning, the colors are stunning, I love the stickers. I’m so so so happy for you, Julien!!
I'm so excited!!
I really thought this was a Jenna coming back announcement wtf!! We need Jenna!!!!😭💔
I really miss Jenna😭🥺
The joy of you painting your Nails is sooooo cute, i love it 🥰 Congrats to both of Cristine and you, and all others involved in the process for making such cool concept come true.   Love 😍😍
all my life I underestimated how utterly sexy a man can look when painting his own nails
Oof...to all that thought the kitchen was coming back. Rip
The green 😍
Eeeeee I got the box set!!
I just ordered monstara and I'm live😁
YYEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHH WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HELLL UYEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

That purple tho 😍 I love that color scheme!!!
It all started at Jenna's Ratchet Salon 🥺
I love knowing Jenna is dying over this collab !!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
It's amazing to see how she just knows how to handle Julien, because she already lives with an Aries 🤣
AHHHHHHHHHH!!! SO EXCITED FOR THIS
This collab is gonna be awesome. But did anyone else low key think his big announcement was going to be Jenna coming back?? 😫😭💔 #ComeBackJenna 🥺
YOU HAVE OUTDONE YOURSELF!! I’m so excited to get them and I love the joy it brings to you🥹🥰❤️
Better be a shade called it’s not about you
Was so excited for this I went to go get my nail polish to paint along with you
21:43 I got excited that's Jenna 😅
Damn it, I’m broke!
i can hear jenna screaming watching the cabinets clip
I feel so relaxed now.
Boring
i love being an Aries because we can do whatever we want & nobody can tell us sh!T bc we don’t give a sh!T 😀
julen needs to get himself a whole nail drying station plss

21:06 okay cute af julien look at your nails!
Super cool collection julen! In your next collection you should name a polish “you know I had to Blue it to ‘em”
I was interested for this, but it's just an ad
Congratulations Julien and Simply!!!! I cant wait to get my box :)))
This is total genius.
15:32 ....was that a "don't drop the soap" joke...during pride month of all times... 😬
This is awesome Julien!!! Love to see great YouTubers doing great things!! I’m just surprised there’s no neon Julien yellow?!💛🫶🏼🔥
thanks for the 22 minute ad
Kind of irrelevant but your tattoo evolution is exquisite.
Juilen, I could NOT be happier for u!!!❤️❤️❤️ no one deserves it more I’m so proud of u!! U are an amazing human ….please give Jenna a big old kiss for me lol I miss Jenna and I promise to not kiss her if I ever met y’all lol ….just love u both so much I still watch the both of u when I go to bed every single night bc y’all both bring me peace and happiness and fills my heart and my head with happy thoughts and feelings as I go to sleep. Long rant but so proud and love u so much ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations Julien! Just bought it for my brother's birthday today, can't wait to try it out 😁
I just ordered the collab! First time I’ve ever bought a whole set. I can’t remember ever liking every single shade! Great work!
YAAASSS
definitely thought it was going to be a huge announcement like a pregnancy, and then you started going off on nails...... but knowing you, i gave it a good 45 seconds before i went "okay this is actually probably about nails" lol. congrats!! very cool
why am i cry? do you how do? who is why i? cry me? yes. cry.
This is a wholesome, chill video. Absolutely love this and the collection
*reads the comments to see if Jenna is coming back*   NOPE irrelevant.

Seeing men express themselves like this is so, so heartwarming.
Hey your on Facebook 🤗...oh another product to sell ☹
I’m so proud of you I originally was a fan of jennas when she was still making videos in NY and it makes me so happy to see how successful you both have been over these past for Jenna at least ten years I really miss her she always made me feel better and not alone keep moving up you guys I’ll always be watching even the old vids♥️♥️♥️♥️
Every time I click on a video of yours you just look cooler and cooler. Now you're looking like a mix between an avant-garde artist, and a rockstar. You pull it off so effortlessly. I would love to see a video about who inspires your aesthetic. 😇
AHHH IM SO EXCITED!!
I loveeee dark green and all the shades in this set. I don’t paint my nails but if I were too I’d definitely be using your colors
Painting nails is great and all, but you got to do something about that mullet my guy.
happpy for uuu :)))
MY 2 FAVORITE CREATORS COLLABED? I CAN DIE HAPPY😍
The bep bep blue looks super similar to the blue fabric Jenna used for his romphim🥺
I can’t not mess up my nails unless they are gel.. it doesn’t matter how long I wait
I miss her
💔💔💔💔❤️❤️❤️🖤🖤🖤
No way... that's freaking awesome!! ♡
More like a care bear Mani, Skittles aren't pastels lol. But they're not holo... 😞 #miss
The collab we’ve all been waiting for!! So proud of you from a fellow Aries BEP BEP BEP BEP
When did y’all get married?  Noticed the wedding ring.
Big love to you Julien. Your authenticity is always such a breath of fresh air. ✨
Collaboration box of nail polish
Congratulations julien!! 💖💖💖💖 The colors are gorgeous and the stickers are so cute 😭
I miss Jenna 🥺
You opening all the cabinets gave me Aries kitchen flashback
Love love love love!!
Nothing like a huge group of dink babies being proud of their dad :)) WE LOVE YOU JULIEN!!!!
my 2 childhood icons collaboration?! IM SO INVESTING IN THIS!! LOVE YOU BOTH!! ♡♡
A LARGE BOWL OF ICE WATER. DUNK YOUR HAND FOR 60 SECONDS AND YOU NAILS ARE DRY! YOURE WELCOME
Holding the bottle is giving me “toddler holding a crayon” lmao (love the collection though, I need that blue!)
So awesome, congrats!!
When is Jenna coming back I’ve missed her so much 🥺🥺
i wish i looked like julien but make it non-binary. i wish i could grow a moustache like you my guy
True Aries energy right there.... YOU LEFT THE BOTTLES OPEN!!   Lol. Love you Julien!! SUPER excited for this and proud of you!! Can't wait until I can get this!
Bring back jennaaaaaaaa
💌dink dink
Bep bep bep!
I miss Jenna!!!!
Love the purple!!
him showing his hands with the rings and the hand poses is serving such HARRY STYLES vibes
Peep Julien wearing a ring on the left ring finger… 👀
As soon as a I heard him say "holo"..I JUST FUCKING KNEW. THIS IS SO EXCITINGGG!!!
This is the most wholesome collab of all time
First step of don't your nails should always, ALWAYS, be going to the toilet. Even if you don't need to at the time, while you're waiting for them to dry, you will, and you won't be able to.
Incredible collab. What has saved me from the endless torture of waiting is a small fan to help dry them faster!
Hold on 👀 Magical Mustache looks like the perfect nude shade for us brown/black girls. I need to check that one out!
julennnnuuuuh so proud of you!
‘Maybe I was this way when I started life’ just sent me away 😂 congrats on the collab! I love the colours, love the stickers, everything!!! 💚
the collab that we all so desperately needed to see
Low key sad we didn't get a Jennas rachet salon manicure 😭
Very excited for you but a small part of me died when it wasn't Jenna's coming back 😭
Love this collaboration!! Also watching simply have to deal with Julens aries behavior 😂😂
Awe this video is so cute 🥰
Julien this is random, but you would be an amazing character in The Stranger Things
KINGO
JULIEN YAY!!!!!!!!
*Bump in your thumb nail*  when you damage your nail bed badly, you can have a permanent trauma mark where it was, even after it’s healed.  i.e. closing a finger in a door can cause this type of trauma
I pray one day Jenna will say something. We love Julien and we love Jenna. They both deserve to be happy, and I hope one day Jenna could find happiness in YouTube again. It hasn’t been the same here without her
Cuuute! Love this!
So so happy 🤍
I have never felt so SEEN than when you did the "waiting-for-the-nails-to-dry" dance.
I'm so happy for you!! I would buy it if I could. Congrats Julen
Simply doing her very best elementary teacher impression in this video
Love it Julien! There should be a special edition Julien Yellow <3
Congratulations on the colab.
you’ve got beautiful hands, julen.
You look like the lead singer of Walk The Moon  This is an unexpected, but very delightful collab. Congrats to both you and Cristine for creating this collection!
NEEEEEEEEEEEEED
Unexpected but extremely cool collab!
IM SCREAMINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG EYYYYY BEPBEPBEPBEP
Hey Google, Can seeing a kitchen be comforting?
YAY JULEN
You guys got married!? Aww I'm sad I missed it! I miss Jenna's videos so much 💕 I hope everyone is doing well
Okay, but that color story is amazing!!!!! I'd buy this collection even if it wasn't a collab between two of my favourite creators!
He’s gone and DONE IT TO EM!
Congratulations!! So happy for you 🥰
YEEEEEEEEEEES
I’M ONLY AT 3:32 & I AM FREAKING OUT— THIS PACKAGING??? THE COLOR CHOICES?!🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
THIS IS SO AWESOME!!!! Julen becoming a beautuber ☺️love you! Hope everyone is doing awesome!!!
Congrats! love that
I literally just mixed an extremely similar purple by combining Lavenduh and Indigo Away when I could’ve just waited 😫 So excited for you both! It’s awesome to see you guys collab even if I don’t need anymore cremes
This is so cool, congratulations 👏
The waiting for it to dry being the true skill is the most relatable
So cool! Two of my favorite creators !
So proud of you Julen!💜💜💜
He's come a long way from Jenna's ratchet salon.
I've always watched you Jenna and Cristine religiously and it's so cool to see such amazing people come together on such an amazing project! I also KNEW there would be a purple color exactly like that! Congrats!
Make a video painting Jenna’s nails ! Julian ratchet nail salon 😩
BEP BEP BEP
This is so exciting!! Love the colors💜 the whole second half had me laughing “drops bottle”
Giving Miami-style Tiger King vibes
this is the best collab ever made
i cant wait to buy everything
They should do a podcast together Great conversational chemistry Maybe even just Julien guest star only the simply podlogical podcast
THIS IS SO COOL! I’m so shocked that there is not a neon yellow!! V excited :)
All the best to you and Cristine-without-an-H and Jenna and Ben.  You are all wonderfully talented, fun, intelligent people who have helped so many of us stay somewhat sane over the years. Please give virtual hugs to Jenna; I imagine I can say for many of us that we miss her mightily, but hope she is happy and healthy. Peace.
when julien said ‘u know anyone who can help me’ i instinctively said out loud BEEEEENNNNNNNN
See you in half an hour bb
When does it come out as I couldn’t see it on the Holo Taco website?
This is so wholesome 🥹🥹🥹🥹 love you Julie!!!!!
I haven’t painted my nails since my teen years and yet… this masterpiece of a collab calls to me. Good looks fam 💅
This is amazing Juliennn!!! So happy for you!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Ah! What a great collaboration!! I love Cristine!!
I have never bought a collab product. I watched the whole dang Consiparcy series... I will buy this.
Omg I remember when you started getting tattoos haha
Wait wait wait am I late to the party or did you just say JENNA PUT A RING ON IT? Congrats!!!
YESSSSSSSSS!!! 🤩✨💛
“When do we do the fist full” 🤣🤣🤣
Tiger king
From a fellow Aries, I appreciate the energy in this video haha. Congrats Julien!
HELL YEAHHHHHH
Ahhhhh best collab I could have ever asked for!
the wedding ring!!! congrats!!!
My favorite people collabing on my favorite thing! I love the colors!
Ah fuck I just got hit by some jerk lady and I have to swallow 3k for car repairs but I still can't say no to this collection please forgive me bank account..
I won't use this on my nails (I mean what's the point where you work a job that'll make it chip off),but I will be using it as a paint because I like what I see and need some way to get these in my life. The colors beg me to use them,and I will.... eventually
JULIENUHHH!!! This is so great and awesome! I'm so happy for you😊 Thank you for showing boys that it's okay to express yourself and live out loud! You're someone my son will be able to look up to as he gets older! Hope you and Jenna and the pups are doing well! 😁
Okay but you missed a great opportunity to call that purple "come get y'all juice"
Watching this as my nails are drying, perfect timing :) congratulations Julen!!!
I love that monstera green 💚💚
You have pretty fingers lol
Congrats Julien!! What a perfect shade of green
Ahhhhh two of my favorite creators!!!
I LOVE this collab, I LOVE the view to like ratio, and I LOVE that I heard about this video on Safiya's and Tyler's stream 💕
Bep Bep Blue is all I could ever ask for Edit: Does Jenna borrow these?
If you spray your nails (lightly) with hairspray they set/dry much quicker
This is so inspiring! My 3 yr old boy  always wants to paint his nails. So thanks for the disclaimer but it will be for children🤫 with my supervision of course 😆
I thought the announcement was Jenna returning to our lives. The world has literally fallen apart without her, I need her energy back in my life
JUUUUULLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! I’m a Virgo! Please close those cabinets!!!!
I thought this was going to be about a Jenna return.
So awesome! Super excited for this!
Omg Julien and Cristine these look amazing 🥺
So cute omg
I love this so so much
Happy to see a Julien table vid, but even happier for this collab 🥰 It also totally feels right for the first collab Holo Taco has to be with a long-time supporter/user. Keeping a tab open and READY FOR THIS DROP!
The fact that you’re leaving the caps unscrewed is making me nervous but congratulations!
MMMMMBEPBEPBEPBEP I'm sorry was the sweater available in that color? Because I thought there was only the teal and pink... and it blended too much so I bought gray, but Cristine's is lovely
luv this! 💖
If I wasn't broke, I'd absolutely be buying that right now!!!! I adore you and her and everything about this!!!!
LIVE LIFE LOUDLY <3
I LOVE THIS I LOVE THIS I LOVE THISSSSS!!!!!!!!
Catch me at the nail salon clapping my hands and going “ehhhhh bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep bep” to get my nails to dry 💜😂
This friendship is everything. I was laughing so much at the nail polish photo lesson.
Stickers are extra cool!
This is so incredibly cool. The purple looks like if someone squeezed out my soul and put it in a bottle
The colors are so you, Julen! I knew this collab would happen someday and now it's here!
this makes me miss Jenna more, I would have loved to see them do this together.
love this ❤️
😱💕😱💕
Got that jujitsu grip haha
LMFAO Cristine is like... omfg is this what Jenna deals with? How?! haha LOVE THIS! So proud of you Julen!! I feel like a proud mom!!
SCREAMINNNNGGGGG!!!!! I cant wait!
love this collab 👌
That blue 💙😍
This is so fucking iconic. Congrats on an awesome collab Julien!!
First off... you rock Julien! Love you've collabed with Christine!! Second she needs to do gel polish.  I was so sick of my nails getting ruined now I only use gel polish so I can  cure it and be done in 60 sec. The best.  Anyhoo, good luck! You'll kill it!
Hey did I miss them getting married? I know they got engaged last year but I see he’s got a ring on…
I have never found the perfect green color until today!!!
I'm so excited!!
We have timers set, with the website opened so PUMPED
Love it! Wish you did a Julien yellow! Maybe the next collab 😉
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING HOLY FUCK HOLY SHIT
I've never worn holotaco before but you know I will now biiiitch
So excited! Love the Collab energy!
You know…at first Julien with the mustache looked like the pedo from Lonely Bones but now he looks like a hot country boy 😂
Yaaaay favorite colab
Those colors are AMAZING!!! I want the blue purple and green so badly
Good job both of you🤍🤍🤍
I see you fully embraced the tiger king fantasy
i totally wish Jenna would have just popped out of nowhere in this video..I miss her so much
You're amazing, pops. Love you 🖤
I’m loving the mullet! It looks awesome!
I want all of these. I feel like the brown would look amazing with a matte finish
Kermet has grayed so much! I miss Jenna and the rest of the fam 😭
BEP BEP BLUE
It nice to hear some one screaming "JULIAN!" again.
Oficially the most chaotic and wholesome nail polish launch
Okay buut where's the julien yellow 🤔 missed opportunity
Congratulations! I'm sure this will be a successful venture for you both!
This is so fricken hype dude, I'm very excited
I needed that ehhhh bep bep bep bep bep today. Thank you papa Julen. 🤣🤣
aaaa i love this
This is so awesome!! Love Holo Taco. What a rad collaboration. Nail polish is for all genders 🖤
Awesome!!
Best nail drying I've ever seen! 😆
Get yourself a manicure please.
This is legendary! I want them so bad
I want to know what combo Simply has on her pointer finger - that yellow/orange gradient 😍
When you’re poor af, but you like “I can go a day without food for some Bep Bep Blue and I’m Live” 🤣 no but seriously, I’m so unbelievably proud of you Julien!!! I hope these aren’t limited time only, but even so, these are gorgeous colors, and I’m so glad y’all collabed!!!! 💜
The colors are such a great representation of you as a person and creator! I'm also throughly impressed with these names! They work so perfectly! 🥹
Great colors for the collection! And those stickers match the vibe so well <3
This needed to happen 😌
Wait wait wait wait ... No JULIEN YELLOW?!?!? WHAAAAAT?
Awesome you become bad bunny lmao 🙂 but hey that's good tho
I love this!!!
THIS IS DOOPE!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💜💙🤎🖤💚
Omg Julien these colors are perfect 🤩
Working professionally with an Aires be like
10 happy fingernails/10
I can't wait to see Jenna's making those awful ramen nails with it
I am so excited to get these for me and my boyfriend (who is also named Julian coincidently)!!! We both love Holo Taco and love Julien’s videos and we were so pumped to here y’all are doing a collab!!!
So this is the most wholesome collab ever.  Honestly in love with the names and the collection box design
WHAT????????? OMG!!!!!!!!  Love and miss Jenna like crazy! 👑
OMG Julien, congrats!! The colors are amazing and I can’t wait to get them myself!!!
you gotta do a quick dry too coat bruh
I really love seeing men enjoying themselves with color and polish and whatever they think is really nice. You go boys! Enjoy yourselves!!
I was hoping this would happen and it did!
Wow I love this
goddamn it man you’ve sold me.  sidenote i’m not like a super regular viewer i’ve missed out a lot recently but idk it’s so cool to watch your growth, like first getting acrylics with jenna to now?  like seeing you start feeling yourself a lil bit in that video with your nails to now where you look like you’re expressing yourself more freely and creatively, is awesome
Using the collection box as a hand rest is such chaotic energy I could never
"It's ok to drop the nail polish"  "no it's not ok to drop the nail polish"  "Wouldn't be the worst thing ever" 🙃 18:48
Me: Never paints my nails.... Also me: NEEDS this ❤️
OMGGGG TWO FAVES!! EVERYTHING WE NEEDED IN LIFE
We love nontoxic masculinity! Julen is so wholesome. We love a man who is confident in himself, and not care about social norms, and will wear nail polish!!!! Honestly? A guy with his nails painted is hella hot in my opinion (because 9/10 he’s not a toxic male)
Love this!
Did Jenna “put a 💍 on it”?  🤔
The colours are fire🔥🔥🔥 And at first I thought they wouldnt go well together but man, they pair so nicely! Well done!😍
The collab I didn't know I needed. I also only wear holotaco! This honestly makes so much sense, love you both!!!
AHHH THIS IS SO COOL!!! CONGRATS
BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP BEP!!
All the Serotonin
i thought jenna was pregananant
I miss seeing this kitchen 😥❤
I'm so ready to buy these!! - Update: I can't wait for them to come in!!
love them. especially the green and grey. sucks not to live in the US sometimes
OMG!!! YAY Julien and Cristine/HoloTaco!!!  NGL, did not see this one coming but love that it happened! Love that he's painting his nails on a stack of his colab boxes 🤣
That green is everything 🤩
that adhd feel when Julien sets a timer and dicks around waving his hands and you feel Understood
I can’t wait to swatch these and make some nail art!!! Also lmao at the nail posing 101 I love it hahaha
This is so cute and I'm so excited!!! I can't thank you enough for being a role model for men who paint they're nails.
IM SO EXCITED
Julen if you get messy when you paint your nails just wash your hands and the remanent nail polish on your skin just comes off.
this is the most wholesome i love this collab so much
OMG!  So happy for you and proud of you.  I must have these!  Waited for this post for days and now I’m SO thrilled!❤️
Disappointed that there isn't a "Julien yellow" but love the whole collection
You dont know how lit I am that there's gonna be a brown nail polish on Holo !!!!
This is a dream come true! I’m so happy for you julen I can’t wait to order some!!!! AHHHHHHHHH ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭
What an exciting collab, and the colors are fantastic!
we need more julien solomita’s in this world
Love love ❤️
The box alone is fucking awesome and I wish I could afford to buy it just for that
That green is, what I consider, a perfect Christmas green!
Love them all. Shocked he didn’t do a julien yellow
My empanada got cold watching this so hard and smiling, this was so sweet to watch🖤
THAT PURPLE DAAAAMN. love the collection! congrats <3
The beautuber we needed
Julie, this is so exciting, I'm so happy for you !
JULIEN!!!!!!!! This is so friggen exciting! When I saw this video I was praying you had created a nail polish!
I have a dent in one of my thumb nails ever since someone closed a car door on it (surprisingly I was bruised and dented but nothing got broken!)  So unique thumbnail club!
Self leveling Julien…who woulda thunk it 😉
Super happy for you julien! The colours are so pretty and the video made me laugh uncontrollably
Congratulations! So happy for you x
did anyone else notice that they have a new table
For some reason running the nails under water helps them dry quicker for me, maybe you can try it in the future?🤷🏽‍♀️ I have no idea why but it helps 😁👍🏼
You look SO AMAZING Julien and I really missed your aesthetic vlogging style. This collab is EVERYTHING. Coming from a regular guy who loves to do his nails (and get tattoos). Keep rocking <3
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
The second he said halo everyone I knew
Love how I’m watching this. And when you get to the purple “I’m Live” - I literally get the notification “come get ya’ll juice” (aka saying that you’re live on twitch)!
THE SURPRISED PIKACHU FACE WHEN U DROPPED THE BOTTLE im dead
I'm so so so happy for UUUUU
In so happy for you, you look so happy🥺🖤 Congratulations!!!🎊🎊 All of the colors look so nice, for me 1. Grey 2. Green + Brown 3. Blue + Lavender  Sidenote: you remind me of a thin Hunter Hancock in this video jaja🌸🌸
I'm a girl who grew up with 2 brothers. Never painted my nails until college years. I did many other things to express myself, I always had music and illustration/design as creative outlets. I truly understand Julien's pain. Getting the nails done? Easiest thing in the world. Waiting for them to dry and stopping myself from immediately doing things with my hands? Mission impossible. My only real sadness is Holo Taco not shipping to Romania. Me and my friends are in pain every time - I'll have to wait to get them when I travel to the UK or something (although I most often go to Greece - but I assume not enough people in Greece want it either, so they're not shipping there either).
1 hour to go, kids! I'm really hoping shipping to Scotland isn't too bad... 🥵
CHAOTIC COLOR SELECTION YESSS
You’re the best Jul
this literally made me so happy!
So him and jenna will never have children???
HOLOOEHHHH BEP BEP BEP BEP LETS GOOOOO!!!!
So excited for this collection! As soon as the release time was announced, my alarm was set!
Dropping your project the day Mercury stations direct...nice...
It's the leaving the bottles open while your nails dry for me
These all look so amazing, but I am obsessed with that purple and that green! Amazing collection, and I can’t wait to buy it once it goes live!!!
“Don’t be done breathing”   Love this so much. Congratulations Julen and Simply 🥰
JULIENNNNN YAAAAY!! So cute so handsome so gorgeous BEP BEP BEP
AHHHHHHHH HOLOTACO I KNEW IT I WAS WAITING
I accidentally double clicked on this video because I already lived it so much 😂
what does the x stand for?
okay, I'm done breathing
SO EXCITED FOR THIS
I knew you had to do it to em with the bep bep blue!
It's been 4 months since Cristine uploaded a video on main channel and I'm not proud to say, but I completely forgot about her!
SSSOOOOO exiting! the Grayet is so special !!!!
super cool! way to go jewelen.
I swear he kept saying skilless mani not skittles. 😆😆
use a hair blow-dryer to dry your nails quickly!! I also hate waiting and don't want to haul a nail dryer everywhere, it works great for me and there's almost always one available wherever you go
While I know full well it's not a workable name, I somehow had completely convinced myself one of the shades would be called "doin' it to 'em" 😂
You look like the singer in HYPA HYPA and I love it
Is this the rebranding of Jenna's Ratchet Salon? Love it all!
Someone at the nail salon taught me this a long time ago. If you lightly touch your nails together and they are t tacky anymore then they are dry
Yes
It's the healthy masculinity for me
god we haven't gotten a good bep bep bep in  awhile <3 proud of u julen!! - seasons of rhye
EH BE BE BEP
I get the bumps too, mine are from biting my cuticles, I'm sure of it, when I don't bite them for a long time, they flatten out but it takes a year or more to grow the bump out. So so proud of you and happy for you. I've never wanted to buy a Collab more just because of you. Congratulations!!! The world is your oyster to enjoy with your otter 🦦🦦🦦
I'm so excited 😭😭 I wish I could buy it on drop!!
Hell yaaaaaa helll yaaaaaaaaaa
So happy for you, Julen!
It stresses me out seeing him leave bottles open 😭
I got so worried you weren’t going to use a glossy taco 😫
omg so excited!
YASSS!!! I’m excited and I’m definitely ready with my card! ♥️♥️♥️♥️ CONGRATS!!
Did you get married?! Is that a ring I see?
Can we get the individual shades or only with the collection?
Who misses Jenna's ratchet salon!💗🙋‍♂️😂🥳🥰
♥️
Idk why but I've literally never seen Brown mail polish which is so weird!
Holotaco is my absolute favorite and I will be trying to get this polish as soon as it comes out!!!
WHERE IS JULEN YELLOWWW
you made me finally get around to repainting my nails. thanks for the company
Yayyyyy we love artsy juulen
You should like hold several color bottles in both hands displaying the nails at the same time. Maybe some model promo pics grasping the holds on a rock climbing wall, or holding a potted plant lol idk im just thinking of things that would work for your hands while displaying the polish
YESSSSSS JULIEEEEEEN AND XTINEEEEE!!!!! Hell yessssssssssssss
"Greyt is Down-Undah" 😂 I'm so excited for this collection!
I screamed, omg 🥺 so proud!
The waiting time being way less with Holo Taco is one of the reasons I only use them instead of other brands because otherwise I always mess them up too.
This makes me heart so happy.
Not me screaming, must be you
I got Cristine's email newsletter with the words "eh bep bep" and literally went "ex-fukn-scuse me?" I love every part of this.
It's the perfect pride flag purple if that makes sense?? I hope I can get this in the UK!!
Not me cheesin' throughout the entire video.
Well, there goes all my money💰 so excited for you (and my nails)!!!
When I saw the combination of pride month + 💅 + "announcement" I thought he was coming out as bi or something HAHA
What in the tarnation
I’m so excited to see this collab and that you were able to do it with Holo Taco and Cristine
Eh bep bep bep bep bep
AHHHHH!
18:02 this had me dying
I’m not crying you’re crying!! 😭
I thought Jenna was coming back😭
Beautiful colors Julien I’m so proud of you 🥹
As an AVID holo taco fan (believe I have 50+ of their polishes) I have to limit myself to one collector's box a year.  This is ABSOLUTELY my box for 2022. Without a doubt.  Congratulations, Julien! What an awesome collab for you.
SO COOOOOL
Im glad there wasn't a multi chrome in there or else I would be 70$ poorer
You and Jenna will always be my favourite youtubers, you were made for each other ❤
EVERYTHING about this makes my heart happy! Proud of you, Julen!! Just when you thought someone couldn’t get any cooler 💅
Such a bummer. How can he like them? Their products start peeling after one day even if it's not the specific peel products. Maddening.
The Virgo in me cried when Julien opened all the cabinets at once
Imma need a red Julien. Happy for you.
Please tell Jenna we love her.
So excited for this julen x simply collab!!
Lol me at the end during the hand poses **JULIENNNUHHHHH**
Yessss! I am so proud of you Juliennnnuh! 🌸💅
Now your nails will look awesome for the basketball game in the morning 😁
This is so wholesome I grinned the whole way through
I KNOW I’m not the only one that is excited to be back in your kitchen. So excited for you and Simply!!
Who else thinks Julien should have his nails painted at Jenna’s ratchet salon featuring his own polish?????💅💅💅
10:56 I'M A VIRGGOOOOAAAUUUHH the ogs will know
Oh my God, this is the collab people have been wanting for such a long time! Congratulations, Julien! You deserve it for all your hardwork! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I have a phobia of stickers, but I’m still going to buy this collection box, I’ll consider it flooding therapy 😅
congrats!
Is that …aquamarine for … ARIES season?!
straight up thought this was a coming out video lol congratz julen! ^^
Proud of you bud 💙
I really want these but yes same I can’t wait for them to dry so I only use gel now 🥹 it’s impossible they mess up Everytime 🙃
This got me nostalgic thinking about old videos with Jenna 🥺 congrats Julen! Can't wait to try the polish ❤️
Congratulations to you and simply lovely colors and amazing colab🥰
Congratulations.  Yyyaayy Bep Bep Blue to a wedding or graduation, oohh la la :) <3
I used to enjoy watching Julien, and Jenna. Even though this is Julien's channel, it was never the same after Jenna went away. I hope she comes back some day. Also, I didn't realize Julien had the Joe Exotic look going on.
I love the shades. I want to buy this!
I have PTSD from Jenna posting an announcement video and then leaving my life forever 😂 I thought this was going to be the same thing 😭😂
I am Julien when my therapist asks me certain questionable life decisions when Christine asked him why it's called the Skittles Mani.
I’m so glad it’s you! What a dreamy collab! Only the best vibes to everyone involved! 😍
That’s so cool Julien! Congrats! I love how happy this makes you
It is so beautiful to see having true friends do a collaboration like this. Both of you came so far and did awesome jobs individually and now together. Love seeing this! <3 Respect for the values you stand for.
Absolutely love this collaboration!!
It looks fantastic julen and cris!
i clicked on this video while i was painting my nails and it is a truly unexplainable feeling
YESSSSSSS
Hear me out. You say “do you know anyone that can help me do my nails?” And then Jenna Marbles walks in.   Please god. Please, just give us seconds of Jenna 😭
Monstera being the shade of Keisha makes my heart smile.
I have been searching for a nail polish in that green for half a decade. Thank u Julen
I remember suggesting Bep Bep Blue and Dink Dink Pink polish with Christine during the very early COVID days and I cannot believe it's become a thing! So happy for you and Simply Nailogical for this. ❤ I absolutely love the colours you chose and the packaging is amazing as well!
Julieeeee! Awesome collab
OMG??!!?!?
“The fistfull”
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS COLLAB! Love you all! ❤️ Halo Taco is the best! This is how you know these are cool REAL people!
shut up!  I need to pause the video and pray they aren't sold out!
This is so amazing. Two of the best humans on YouTube being the best humans together. 🥲
Let’s all take picks of us gripping the bottles wayyyy too hard lol
‘She liked it so she put a ring on it’ Julieeeeeen that’s so cute 🥺💗
You'd think all the Aries Tornado-ing would have dried those nails so fast! 😂   I'm so excited for these colors, especially the purple and green, and I'm dying to see what the green looks like under the matte topcoat, omg
So proud and happy for you two! Lovely colors
wowowwo i was just talking with my husband about how he wants to paint his nails... what a perfect opportunity thnk u
Please send one to Jacob sharpe! He is always rocking some cool polish
Can't wait to buy these!! I'm so excited for you!!
Looove it! Also…MISS YOU JENNA

7:02 Julien really said "Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss uwu"
Julen please PLEASE say ‘you know we had to do it to em’ in anyyy of your promotion/marketing content😂😭😂😭
The bep beps got me! Listening up now
This makes me so happy, I feel fluffy inside 😊
Oh it's an #ad

I thought Julien was gonna come out lol
Also, the mullet be looking v nice 👌🏻
I miss Jenna- idk I used to like julien when he did the cooking thing but lately he just isn’t for me- (I swear I thought he was on drugs in his last three videos excluding this one) crazy how people change!!!
I feel you Julen, I’d paint my nails way more often if I didn’t have to wait for them to dry 😅
EHHHHH BEP BEP BEP BEP LOVE U MAN
wedding ring? 💕
That is such a pretty purple tho
I am so proud of you 😭 I’m a new nail tech and this is perfect timing. I love that I can buy products for my work and support you at the same time. 💖
Didn’t even listen to the drop date and RAN over to the website only to find out I’m early lol 😅 I was panicked I’d miss out
I envy Julien, he can willingly wear what he wants and acts however he wants. If I dressed how I want I will immediately get fired lol
Congratulations guys. Xxx😍😍😍
Congratulations on your collab!! So exciting!! Love the colours!!
Julian looks like he needs to be on Trailer Park Boys but of course under a different name Bc that name is clearly already taken.
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH
Looks like Barry m nail varnish
The Holo Julien cinematic universe is so needed rn in the world
Yes yes yes !!!
NOT ALL THE CABINETS OPEN 😂😂😂😂
I need this collection!! The Colours are so good
Never saw this coming! Your latest Instagram captions dropping hints all this time!! 💅😂
i’m so excited for you both😭❤️
I miss Jenna and her smile.  I resonate with her personality and I'm 51!  Congrats J...not gonna lie, thought this was a baby on board thing :)
💖✨️💅
So excited for you!! Congrats!
So excited!!!

👏👏👏👏👏
Jenna needs some for the ratchet salon. We miss her.
I screamed JULIEEENNNNNNNNNNN when he left all the cupboard doors open
I have no need for it personally, but love and appreciate these designs you made!
I'm all about my nails 💅  I'll be getting these for sure!!
Congrats on the collab! So proud of you and Cristine for putting this together. I can't wait to rock these colors and stickers this summer 👽🌈🌞🦄
The collab I've been waiting for and didn't even realize it.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!
Im so mad at you for having that in the background
I have loved these two separately for soooo long, so this collab feels like a personal gift from JulienXSimply for enduring these past couple of years. So proud 🥺
Juliennnn we are all so excited for you and proud of your super cool accomplishments 💕 very ready for this launch!!
Ohhh there's that purple creme that's been teased for months!! I don't even like cremes that much but it's so prettyyyyyy (mostly because my fave color of all time is purple, I can't help it)
🥺 two of my faves coming together
THE WEDDING RING
I HAVE JUST ENOUGH TIME TO WATCH THIS BEFORE STREAM STARTS
Lmfao omg you are awesome 🤣😊
nothing has ever made me feel more butch than I do right now and I'm honestly living for it. go off, julen! I understood a third of everything you said, but your nails look cute as hell!!
That’s a dope shirt 👚
I wondered if you would do a collab when I first heard you on stream saying you used them years ago!! So excited, wish I had the funds for this, it looks AMAZING!!
Wow Julien, I was somewhat skeptical of how the colors would go together, but they are a perfect match for each other! And they look incredible on you!
Not the cupboards!! Close them! iykyk  Im so happy and proud to see both of my favourite content creators making my favourite nail polish 💅
You're SO giddy, you have the worst pokerface 😂❤️ so happy with this collab!
THIS MAKES MY HEART SO HAPPY! My favourite YouTube creators collabing makes me so giddy!!!
Next pack in this colab needs to be a top coat with orange and white flecks called Bunny
If the announcement is not that Jenna is coming back… then I’m done!
Oh def buying this julen! Congrats the colors are GORGEOUS!!!!!
I’ve been a terrible nail biter for like 25 years, super embarrassing. Finally decided to break the habit bc I loved your nails! My nails grew out just in time for your polish lol
never has a nail polish collection launch given me such a strong urge to tend to my nails retroactively. these colors make me  e m o t i o n a l
Woo dream collab ❤ 🎉  very exciting
Awsome gift to myself for my 30th birthday today. Great job collaborating 🥳💕💅🏽
Congrats Julen! Bep Bep Bep!
YES JULEN IM SO HQPPY FOR YOU
Ever since Jenna gave you them acrylics!  I love this for you and Christine...a collab that was destined to happen!  ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Watching this video as I'm painting my nails 💅
I'm also incapable of waiting for my nails to dry, so I always make sure to have my laptop out, because I can use my keyboard without screwing my nails up
ZZZZzzzzz…….
Was waiting for the BEP BEP BEP
That purple 😭❤️
My battery died while I was vlogging, sat down while its charging and your video has perfect timing. I painted my nails with you. You did a hell of a lot better than me lol love your nails.
Paints nails in Aries.
Congrats Julien so happy for you guys. Can't wait to get my hands on it ( I mean my nails ).
I can just hear Jenna now “JULIENNN you’re gonna knock those over, put the lid on all the way!”😂 congratulations this is amazing
These are amazing!! On a other note did julien get married?
I never imagined this Collab happening but now i can't imagine it not existing 😭❤️
I AM SOSOSOSOS EXCITED FOR ALL OF THIS BUT SIDENOTE IVE BEEEEN LOOKING FOR THAT SHADE OF GREEN FOR FOREVER MY DUDEEEEEEE--SOON AS I SAW YOU SHOWING IT OFF IN THE RECENT POSTS BUILDING UP TO THE LAUNCH I WAS LIKE AHHHHHH THATS THE GREEEEN
Didn't expect that this video would make me cry but here I am! I am so insanely proud of the man I've seen you grow and flourish into over the last 7-8 years, Julien. I am forever grateful for you 💜
Simply beplogical
julien i am so happy for you!
Love love love love this. Love this energy. Love this community you’ve created
👌🏻❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for uploading today. I just had to put my dog of 14ish years down today, and I really needed this. His name was Dobie.
Oh my god that box art is so good!! A collab made in heaven - hats off to all involved. <3<3<3<3
I'm really excited for you Julien! I totally expected a Julien yellow, but you subverted my expectations! If do a commercial, can it be you running in slow motion whilst holding five bottles in each hand with all the dogs run behind you?
what a perfect collab !!!!!!!
🥂 Congratulations Julien 💅🏻 !!!🥂 Wishing You & Holo Taco Great Success !!! - Cheers 👊🏻 From 🇨🇦
So happy for you julen !! Congratulations they all look so good 💜💜💜💜💜💜
I'm so excited!!!! I hoped you two would one day collab! I cannot afford this, but also .... eh bep bep beeeeppppp!
julien, my 5 year old son secretly painted his nails one day and when we found out he thought he was going to get in trouble. i let him know that there was nothing wrong with painting his nails, he just needed some supervision. later that week my very conservative dad tried to make him feel embarrassed about his nails. “boys don’t paint their nails” and it broke my son. i introduced him to you, showed him your nails, and he has loved seeing your nails when you show them on stream. i want you to know that you’ve helped him so much and have made him feel so comfortable. i told him about you coming out with this nail polish and we agreed that we both needed the whole collection. thank you thank you thank you for helping my son feel comfortable in his own skin 🤍
Flashback to Jenna’s ratchet salon😭😭😭love you guys
Shut up! Love this!
lula livre no final ali kkkkkkkkkkkk
Lets goooo! I am just patiently waiting for the stream to start lol. I started off as a huge Jenna fan many many years ago and then found Julien and Simply along the way. I have a ton of Holo Taco and know the quality is the best there is! Can't wait to get the collection with my two faves on the internet!! <3<3<3
Like why am I crying right now? That’s some serious parasocial love for you and Cristine. I’m a broke student that doesn’t paint my nails enough to make it worth it for me but know I’m so so so happy for y’all.
OMGGGGGGGGGG KS SKSNSKDSKBSD
Well this is adorable
So excited for this, two of my favorite people! Can't wait to buy it💜
Not it being 4pm eastern and me thinking I can get some 6 better hit soon
ITS HAPPENINGGGGGGGGGG
OBSESSED
"holo" everybody lol
Dammit, I was really hoping to NOT spend $60 on nail polish, but every single one of those is a color I want.
I was not prepared for how emotional this video made me. I can't wait to support the collaboration of two of my favorite content creators. Congratulations to you both!!! Please take all of my money now 😅😅😅
I am so utterly happy for you, Julien. How amazing is it that we get the honor of a nail collection that is as amazing as You and Cristine! I am sure this is going to be a huge hit. Your collection colors are beautiful and unique, just as you are. All the best to you, and thank you for sharing this collection with those of us that love you. 💜
Ooo the purple is giving me hella Unit01 vibes 💜
Julien without polish is like a cat without hair
Omg obsessed.
OH I wasn't expecting to see everything before the lives!
I'm not sure why, but whenever I see an announcement on this channel, I always pray its to tell everyone Jenna is coming back.
I’ve never needed anything more 😭
Seeing Julien and Cristine in the same video is freaking me out a little bit, but in the best way
I’m so happy and excited for you!! This is so fun. I laughed out loud at the brown thumb bit. And the colors are so beautiful!
MONSTERA GREEEEEN!!! I KNEW IT 💜  I am so happy and excited for you and Simply - great collab 👏 👏 👏  now... bep bep blue needs a dink fam pink 😉
Pop off queen love u
I never buy anything on launch day, but you had to do it to em. I’m so excited that my favorite people on YouTube have a collab!
SCREAMING!  I’m so excited
This collab makes me so happy!
EHHBEPBEPBEPBEP   (holo it's me Juline again✨)
Hey BEP BEP BEP BEP BAYBEEEEEE. My holo heart is happy with this collaboration!!!!!!
The waiting is the worst.  I've been doing my nails for 7+ years but every single time I give myself a manicure my ADHD ass bumps them against my keyboard or hair or clothes or something and they get dented.  Clothes are the worst though because once you get nail polish on something you either stop wearing it or commit and splatter some paint on the rest of it.
YESSSSAAAS AMAZINGGGGGGGG
HOLO SEXUAL BABIIEEEEEEEEE!!! 😻😻😻😎🥰
Omg Julen why you do this to me 😭  I’ve been wanting to try Holo Taco for so long, and I especially feel like I NEED this special Julien box, but I’m nowhere near being able to afford it. Uggggh  However, enough self pity, I’m so happy for you, this is so bleppin’ cool man. Beautiful collection, I feel the personality seeping through each color 😌💅🏻
Yooo
I’m so excited to try and get my hands on this collection!!! 💅🏼
missed u guys hope ur doing good also muy excited for the polish
OMG WICKED! HOLO CROSSOVER!
I’m getting some forest and campfire vibes from the palette. Love it.
Sorry if I missed this somewhere in the video but will they be sold individually ever? I rarely paint my nails but would love the green one!
This will be such an awesome collab! Also, I forgot how amazing your kitchen is.
Love this for you Julien. Gotta say dude, I've been watching your videos since....yow, since a little after you got Peach!! Lordy I'm old. >__< I loved your vlogs. The warmth and humor in your vlogs comforted me at times when things were very hard for me. I needed something to get my mind off of it all, and you and Jenna and the doggos offered such a wholesome distraction. I appreciated how you never seemed to chafe against Jenna's celebrity, didn't seem to need a cookie to continue to be supportive. And now in recent years since she stepped away, it's been cool to watch you build a community as you experimented with the kind of content you wanted to produce. Keep doing you and what feels right for you. Much love to you and the dink fam.
This is so awesome dude proud of you
YESSSSSSSSS I will purchase this immediately
My heart! This is so magical Julian! Everything from the packaging, to the colors, and all the little details... it's just so great. As someone that has followed you since the AMP days, I've gotta say I'm just so proud of you!
EBEPBEP AYEEEEEEEEEEEE HELLL YES LETS GO💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💅🏼
I‘m so excited julen!! Literally my dream collab
halo cristine! ❤❤❤
Man Julien this is so exciting! Proud of all you've done with your merch releases and now this!
I'm so excited!!!!!!
I can hear this video title
One of my favorite collabs ever!
SOOO EXCITED
The CHAOS Mani. :D <3
buying
Watching you struggle to do the hand pose and clenching the bottle so hard is making me cry with laughter lmao
Would love to have it myself as well, (in Turkey, can't order) I am really happy to see all the youtubers that I love have become friends and you are collaborating for nail polish (has my fav colors in it julien such a good job!) I know it will do so well, congratz!
Why does every color feel like it represents the many sides of Julien? I need this in my life, dude.
I've missed your videos. Congrats on the collection
I love love love that you are Collabing with Simply! Two of my favorite youtubers coming together. :') Only problem is I JUST bought nailpolish from her.... should I get more? Lol.
omg I love this!!! How awesome, congratulations!!!
Hiding the box in the celebrity alcohol shot omg whatta trollllll haha CONGRATS julien! Can't wait to try it out
Excited to see you enter the beau-tuber phase of your career
yess juliennnnn i love thisss im painting my nails with you ^~^
JULENNNNN. HOLO DINK DINK
Congratulations.   The colors look so good.
Two of my fave people 🥹
Your kitchen is so beautiful!
The VIBES!! I'm so excited to add this one to my collection. Two of my favorite people on the planet making my favorite polish in some of my favorite colors?? Serotonin booooost for days!  ✨️✨️💅💅💕💕
Gel manicure could be good for you. It dries instantly
♥️
Congratulations on your debut. I love your energy Julien. It’s contagiously good. 💙
the waiting is easily the worst part haha. that glossy taco is a lifesaver
I love the way he refers to his fingers as our fingers
I have never related to Julien more than when he was talking about having to learn to not be heavy-handed when painting his nails and then having to wait for them to dry. Both are soooo difficult for me!
Julien OMG, you are amazing thanks for being such a great creative, entertaining unique and beautiful human to watch on YouTube for creating with your art and being yourself while doing so. Love watching you thru the years. Congratulations in your collab keep creating ❤️
Very cool 😎.....people love you man. Congrats
Please don't sell out before my payday!!!🤞🏾😭
This video truly made me so happy. I could not stop smiling and laughing! So excited for the live launch 🤗 congrats julen and simply on the collab
Woo hoo!!! What a nice end to my day of so much writing.
It's stupid how happy this collab makes me! But Julen, close your nail polish bottles when you're done with them! They're gonna get all thiccc. 😆
wholesome
Well that was the most relatable sentence I’ve ever heard you say, Julen.  “Intrusive thought. Stayed in my head though.” -me being proud of myself every time I don’t unnecessarily veer into a semi while driving
NEED BLUE AND GREEN F
Yaaaas!!! I LOVE the Monstera color. So excited for you!  Also does anyone know where he may have gotten that pendant? It looks like stormbreaker and I love it
I'm so excitedddddd!!!!! Congrats Julie!!! I'm ready to pretty up my nails.
oh my god, now this is an exciting collab!
Watching him be so happy makes me so happy
Currently running around my house yelling BEP BEP BLUE repeatedly cuz I'm so fucking excited AHHHHH
Dad gave us the best pride month gift ever
cristine wearing kremes?? creams???
Oh babe. Get a quick dry top coat. It’s gonna up your game so much!
JULIEEENNN MY HEART IS SO HAPPY
I really hope I get paid in time to get this collection! The colors are so beautiful 🥺
I feel ya " J " in the free expression thing. I love when people, feel free about expressing their true nature... Great for you , this looks great ... !✨🌟👏💅
Use me as the waiting on launch button
He kinda looks like a “lesbian” I’m digging it
this is very reminiscent of how julien used to aries it up w jenna. love this dynamic!! can’t wait for the collection to launch
This is actually the perfect collab.
My nails need this polish! Now! 💅🏼
Omg!!!!! I love this!
IM GETTING THIS
EH BEP BEP BEP IT UP Julien: >starts semi calm Me: okay, we adjust the vibe.  Nailpainting? Hell yeah. I've been meaning to all week, thanks for letting me sit down with u/☆*~
Idk what it is yet but AYYY BEPBEPBEP
“Brown thumb” …literally paints pinky nail
Love the colours but wheres the Julien Yellow!
This is destiny. Ever since you let Jenna give you acrylic nails, and she commented on what beautiful nails you have, it was just obvious they were blank canvases that needed to be painted.
Peachy can help you with the beauty shots if you pay her! Pretty sure she still hasn't payed off her debt to Jenna.
🫶🏼
I'm so happy for you Julen!!!! what a lovely surprise
Tell Jenna I miss her so much !
I'm actually surprised there wasn't a yellow in the set... does that mean there'll be a second set of colors???? 🤔🙊 I CALLED IT!!!!!
Holooooo Tacooooo  This peel porn is about to be next level
is julien engaged or married?????? "she liked it it so she put a ring on it"
Gorgeous colors that I for sure don’t have in my collection yet! I’m so excited to buy the box!!!
Look at you, out here, smashing it. My dude.
I love monstera ! It's the green I've been looking for !!! Thanks Julian ☺️
I have to stay awake till 1am for the launch and I'm way too pregnant to do that. But I'm going to and imma buy this beech. Because I deserve it and I love it.
GO JULEN!!! You deserve every good thing that happens to you! 🧡🧡🧡
I am crying at the death grip julien has on the bottle
I love this so much! And you have pretty handsies 😍🥰
Ayy
Taco ‘bout awesome!!! 🙌🤩💅🏾♥️💜☀️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I love it!! 💅🌵✨🌠
HOLOOOO
BEP BEP 🌈🌈
JULIEN ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS IF YALL GOT MARRIED YET???? Also will be buying this AMAZUNG collab
Julien just Ariesing to the max when he interacts with Cristine
I'll keep wishing for a video without any ad or promo as the main motive
Congrats juliiiiiiien! I barely have any finger nails to paint but so excited for you and this collab looks amazing and also the colors! 💖💗
I totally relate to the nail drying process. 🤣
YOU BEST BELIEVE I'M COPPING THE MONSTERA COLOR
So as someone who only dresses in more earthy colored clothing, nail polish always stands out too much for me to wear it. These colors look like they'd actually complement my clothes tho so that's rad.
AHHHHHHHH i have been doing okay but i didn't realize how much I needed this 😭💕
“Do you know anyone that can help me” 🥹🥹🥹🥹 I do, I do know someone who can help. Miss you always Jenna 🤍
"the camera needs to be on, sir" - Crisitine with no H
Noooo I’m too broke for this Julien 😭😭new merch announcements always just make me sad
AHHH IM SO PROUD OF YOU!
Cristine is filling in for Jenna, telling him to Staaaaaahp Ariesing sooo hard!
Best collab EVER!!!
Think about a man painting his nails
So excited for this collection!
Awwww yay! These colors are right up my alley!
You’re becoming a female
You look like the tiger king if he turned to meth in his 20s
ngl part of me thought this was a coming out video because of the 💅 in the title lol. Congrats on the collab Julien!
"She liked it, so she put one on it" made me 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
You know they had to DO IT TO EM. Love this so much. Two really lovely people coming together for an awesome collaboration. I'm only two minutes in and I can't wait to see the different names for the polishes.
I've been waiting for this day!!! Eh BEP BEP BEP Best long distance collab ever
TERRIFY THE CUSTOMER
love the colors!!! So excited to order!
Im so excited and so happy you both collabed!!!!
So proud of our Son Juley-oolie-ooo!
Hell yea!! Love holo taco!! Iconic
IM SO HAPPY
Could we possibly request you and Jenna as hand models for the nail polishes?
Best Collab EVER! 😍
OPI Drip Dry Lacquer Drying Drops- try these and no more waiting for drying. 5 minutes and you are done
I’m not a nail painting person but this all looks very dope!  I wish Jenna was able to participate in this video because I honestly miss that but very happy for you either way. All the best.
Proud of you Julien!! So wholesome I love it😆
The Aries energy is strong on the waiting.
Yassssss live out loud king
Congratulations Julen!!! 😍😍😍 they’re beautiful!
this is noice👌🏼
Omg yay :)
I love you guys
This is so exciting. Congrats
I’m so excited about this!! But I must say I really wish there was a Julien yellow
MY HEART IS SO FULL
I thought it was gonna be a wedding thing 😭
I love them! I’m proud of you!!! ❤️
HOLO! I am so proud of you Julen!!
Wait.  Is that a weddin ring?!
I get my nails done but immmmmma get this.
I was hoping one of them would be called "DOIN IT TO EM"
“That’s how I know it’s my nail!  …..aside from the fact that it’s on my finger and hand”   STOP 🤣🤣😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Congrats Julien! You have come a long way from when i first saw you in one of Jennas videos in the beginning of your relationship. 🥰🥰💖
Not Julen leaving the nail polish bottles open while he waits for his nails to dry💀
This Collab is perfect
THIS IS SO COOL
'greyt is Australian' the LAUGH that just left my body
Is the whole household wearing these colours? And by that I mean, are dogs able to wear human nail polish?
Love this!!! Its so cool and the colors are amazing!!!!! You done good
I audibly yelled when you opened All the cabinet doors
YAASSS!! oh my goodness this is epic. congrats on this collection! 🥳🥳
There is no one that deserves this more than you! So proud of you!!
JULIEEEEEENNNNUHH how exciting for u all!! so proud, good luck and enjoy :) ily
June 3rd???? lorelei and luke's supposed wedding date????
Havent painted my nails in a while and only have one set but I’m excited to buy this one 💙
Man, you can see how proud and happy you are when you pick up the box. 💚  Unrelated (sort of) but I'm transmasc and idly thinking of getting back into painting my nails — this is exactly, perfectly gorgeous timing. I hope I can get a set sometime. Super proud of you Aries king 👑👑👑
woo! thats awesome!
Dude, this collab makes so much sense! I don't paint my nails bc lazy but if I did, I would totally wear these! Omg the fistful 💀
Holo, Julen! 😁🤚 Congratulations on the collab with Christine! 🫶
So excited this is amazing 👏
Congratulations, JULIEN! 🤩👍🏽
This is everything, congrats Julen!!!
I thought you were gonna announce your own celebrity alcohol 😂 But this is DOPE 💕
I recently just started painting my left thumb. Started with just testing my model paints or my model paint pens on my thumb, now i just do it because i like it. Idk why. But i do it for fun now
i love this so much omg 🥺❤️
*Julen opens ALLLLLL the cabinets* *panics in Jenna*
This is so cool! congratulations!
Awesome colors, awesome creators. Cannot wait to get it!
I picked up a nail art plate that had it was like a typewriter and it had all of the letters within a circle. So I use the ass to put on each finger when I do skittles nails. Makes it look really cute.
Two of my worlds colliding 🥰🥰 So happy for you ❤️
"no, and also don't drink the nail polish". bless you cristine, we all know he needs to be reminded from time to time
Yess I have alarms set to get this for my son.
If I don't get one I will cry
NOBODY GIVES A 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩!!!
i’m so proud of you and so excited for this collab🫡
Lit. Stay hydrated y'all
The wedding ring 🥹🥲💕
Best. Collab. Ever. Omg. I was so worried and this is so wholesome! <3 <3 <3
We are so happy for you!! EH BEP BEP BEP
This had me howling with laughter. Wishing I was a fly on the wall when you were trying to film this and winding each other up. Congratulations on the colab. Love you both.
I love these colors so much!!
Love the relationship between you guys and the Holos. So excited for you all!!
Congrats 🤩😍🇲🇦 my two fav youtubers  Bep Holo

Congratulations, Julien!! What a collab! 11/10. That black metallic is sick, reminds me of gunmetal! And the stickers!! 😍👏🏻
I'm gonna cry,, this is so wholesome!! So heckin proud of you, sir!! (Also the bep bep blue is giving me flashbacks to the episode nail painting animation,, oh no-)
I wish everybody would support any hobbies that make someone happy without judging .
My credit card info is on hand and I am ready
🥲
i physically feel your joy through the screen bc its just so infectious. im just really incredibly happy for you :') this is great <3
Hashtag ad.

Let’s gooooooooo!!!

this makes so much sense oh my god i love this so much
I am truly honoured to collab with you Julen🥹 what a wonderful process, video, experience, and end result nail polish collection💅 you do be bringing the vibes and I cannot thank you enough✅✅✅
I have bumps in my thumbnails too but it’s from psoriasis
9:54 Looks absolutely epic! 🤩
It’s blurple! I’ve been seeing it pop up in a lot of makeup lately too. 💜💙
LIVING
alternating the green and the brown would look so good, earthy vibes
HELL YEAH 💅🏽💅🏽
Omg I can’t wait to get it!
I love this collection !
BEP BEP YES.
why do you have it if it's supposed to be kept away from children? /j
HOLO JULEN
I’m wearing Holo right now! It’s all I wear. Can’t wait for the drop, congratulations on the collab!!
Julen the colours are perfection 😱
Oooh congratulations! Fantastic choice for the colors, I'm definitely buying this!

I’m here I’m here I’m here
BLOWIN' THIS SHIT UUUUPP
I hope they do another Collab of dog colors! Weach, Marble, Kermit, and Bunny. 😭
When I first saw the collection I read “I’m live” as in where you’re living and was so confused but happy to be involved
LOVE THIS! the colors, the box, EVERYTHING
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AS;LDKJG;ASKDG
Beyond happy to see you and Cristine created something that clearly brings you both so much joy ❤️❤️❤️ TAKE MY MONEY
so so excited for this!!!
These are stunning Julien! Also love that so many of these are referencing the greys & Jenna’s previous hair colours!!
“Hence the color of my mustache is brown”  I love how this implies he dyed his mustache 🕵🏽‍♂️ to match the nail polish 💅 rather than the other way around 😆
So exciting!!
my nails are horrendous bc i bite them but im still gonna buy because i love julen and cristine
I can't wait to get this collection!
Loved you, Jenna, Cristine and Bentendo for many many for years, so this is really exciting, congrats for the collab!
Please tell Jenna I love and miss her
OoOoo who else got a little spoiler from Safiya and Tyler’s live stream BUT this is still exciting! Congratulations 🥂
this is so exciting!! i just got into painting my nails and this is so exciting!!! i really love all the colors and hope i can buy it!!
WOOO SO EXCITING
I saw this comment somewhere else but damn I’ve never laughed harder  “You should name 3 of them Anne Hathaway, Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts and then just have them all be the same color”
I miss the cooking videos.😭
Ok I know this is going to sound really random, but I feel like you'd be really good at making self help audiobooks. Your voice is like the combo of calming and making me want to write a to do list.
im not crying you're crying
I’d love to get some of your polishes, but nail polish is a bad sensory trigger for me so I unfortunately can’t use it. Still though, so proud of how far you’ve come and so glad you are able to express yourself like this!
I'm crying!! So happy for you and Cris!!!
Ayooooo Table Gang
CONGRATULATIONS!!  CRISTINE & BEN are amazing people. I'm so glad to see your friendship has continued through the years
All I can say is congrats.. this is huge and so damn dope
Immediate yes, I’m always so happy to support you and Jenna ❤️
HOLY SHIT JULEN 🥹🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I’m so proud of you!! I cannot wait to purchase your collection 🥰
So proud of you papa you deserve the world!! The dink fam is so proud of you 🥺💖 I can’t wait to have matching nails with everyone!
I haven't been able to do ANYTHING today because I'm so excited for this launch. I'm just a mess
Yooooo!! So exciting! I started really painting my nails when I saw you would paint yours years ago. And while I'm not sure if I'll be able to get this set, I'm very happy for you!!
Yass Holo toco!
Thought the announcement was about Jenna 🥺
so happy for you Julen!!

Dink fam o7
I saw the tik tok with this announcement and was so excited. Congrats Julien!!!
I thought he was going to announce that him and Jenna were pregnant and I started tearing up before I watched the video
YAY! i’m so excited! i’m so happy for you! this is something so amazing, thank you for everything you do! 😭🥰
Really thought Julien would do more than almost all plain cremes in generic drugstore shades. They’re cute, but nothing special and it seems like a missed opportunity.
This is honestly everything! Everything about it from the colors to the beautiful packaging screams Julen and I’m so excited for you guys!!
be proud of yourself!!  I know I am.
Man’s style is so cool and explorative and funky. Of course you enjoy it- the fit demands some pretty ass nails
CONGRATS JULEN!
This will be the collab of the century!!!

Julen, y u do my bank account this way 😍😍
As someone who loved painting my nails before transitioning (FTM), and had to really build up that confidence to start doing it again after transition, I love seeing cisdudes rocking the painted nails. Just gives me a boost of confidence. Edit: look at this  comment section bein wholesome as hell ♥♥
