Jeffrey you are so happy, relaxed and passionate about nature and your animals. That is what my life is all about.... nature and animals. So grounding. Wish you well.
Jeffrey’s natural beauty is amazing he looks so good and so happy
Ryland is rude as fuck in real life, So I stopped watching him. Shane is very nice though!
back here in 2025 and i wanna say i love jeffree with eyebrows so much
Ok I still watch jefree star reviews on YouTube !!!
Definitely a nice grounding place for him, and nice home of course. I think I will always miss his pink house in Calabasas though 😢 the colors, the velvet, the chandeliers. That house was gorgeous 😌
WAIT ITS  CHRIS!!!!!!!! WHY DID I NEVER NOTICE THIS OMG
I’m so embarrassed I never showed you 0-60  And just gets done talking about I wrecked my car lalala dumb ass still showing off
I’m 29 never been on TikTok. Never had the app. Don’t see the appeal. I’m on YouTube all the time. Just saying
Jeffree come back tho :((((
I need another Shane and Jeffree series please 😭😭😭😭
Coming back two years later to say we stilllll need a Jeffree Shane Wyoming paranormal adventure 🎉🎉🎉
Such incredible talent.
This news is easy to understand.
I miss your videos Shane 😢
Such a beautiful voice.
Such incredible talent.
Such a beautiful voice.
Very reliable source of information.
Omg... Jeffrey so good and down to earth at the airport unbelievable. Hes such a great person. Hes scorpioness omg ...very me.
Rewatching this you can tell that Jeffrees vibe towards Shane Ryland and Chris are so off in this new series with him and as he should too!! He realized that you mfs are some shady ass people on the internet and absolutely shouldn’t be trusted. Like I got so much satisfaction with Jeffree called Ryland Adam’s an asshole 😭🤣🤣😂
Shane was being negative kinda making fun of Jeffries nee life. Like he misses all the material things Jeffrey had
Ghost hunting in Wyoming with Jeffree series? Yes, please.
How ru
Ghost hunt with him
We need a shane Jeffree update
We actually need a series with jeffree exploring paranormal and haunted places 😍
I can't beleive I trusted u
Jeffree is right. YouTube is dead. I used to watch so many YouTubers every single day and now I only come back for this series 2-3 times a year.
I miss them...
😭😢😪 please Jeffree Dunn quit I still love your videos
I love how h sis honest YouTube sucks! lol
Nahh I still watch Youtube. ☺️ When I got a new phone I didn’t download Tiktok back.
What they should have done, this past November relaunched the conspiracy collection or at least the palettes. That would have been a fun like happy 5th anniversary hiiiiiii.  I also know Jeffree has used a hunch of the colors from what was to be the doomsday palette but I’d still love that palette!! Even now in 2025 seeing some of those colors im like god I would love to have a color like this right now!! I have 8364849 palettes and some of those shades Shane made, aren’t in any palette.  And I still use the conspiracy palette. I  had bought 2, one to use and to just have because I love special collections and I’ll buy 2 of everything so I can use it but then hold on to things and never touch them … I am a mom, a wife, an intensivist … when I was in school and during my residency, makeup playtime was just like where I got to have time just for myself … especially during quarantine because I was away from my son and my husband for so long being a doctor I wasn’t about to go home and possibly bring Covid into the house. That was rough!! But it’s what I signed up for going to school for 8 years, doing 3 years of residency and a fellowship year….. I’m a critical care doctor, I work in the icu and that’s where all of our covid patients were. I was literally with Covid patients every single day. So I lived in a hotel for a few months. I knew my son was being taken care of by my husband, they had a blast just being the boys and the makeup especially palettes like the conspiracy and mini controversy palette gave me an outlet to decompress…. Then summer of 2020 when I was able to go home and things were still super scary but we understood a lot more at that point and it was becoming “normal” … it’s when I got pregnant with my twins!! Everyone is always like ohhh so after being apart for like 2-3 months you end up getting pregnant…. Even the baby was excited and decided to split 😂😂 identical twin girls. Aria jade and Morgan Nicole. Funnily enough I just found out that Ryland’s siblings are Morgan (I knew that) and AUSTIN!! And that’s my 16 year old son’s name. I’m like Mrs Ryland’s mama has good taste in names 😂😂 anyway it would be really cool if they had relaunched the conspiracy collection back in November 2024!! Missed opportunity. They should have done that AND did like a mini collection for the anniversary!! Like a mini palette and a highlighter… or 2!! And it could have been the babies collection!! Oh that would have been super cute too!!  Anyway, I still would love to have that doomsday palette!! Maybe not call it doomsday but the palette itself with all those colors TOGETHER!! I think a lot of people would love that even now in June 2025 baby
16:45 😂funny part
I love shane and @jefferystarr🎉..i kno this is 2yrs late but. ...im just catching up i am absolutely binge watching shane n Jeffrey
I can say this is true. YouTube isn’t what it used to be. Content is consumed so quickly now—Instagram and TikTok even added 2x speed buttons. Platforms evolve, like when we left cable TV for streaming services like Netflix. Jeffrey hasn’t posted in months. People usually go to YouTube for podcasts, reviews, or unboxings, not for entertainment like before.
Reminder that Jeffree star is mf transphobe
2 and a half years later and i’m asking for a haunted wyoming jeffrey series!!!
“billie eilish said that and she was like screaming and crying in that song so I don’t know” 🤣🤣🤣
Shane is so over the top broadway type drama queen
He is still very materialistic though😎 Just the conversation about the purses…. But good he is doing good!
Jefree you need a garden!!! 😢 you need flowers and medicinal plants lmao
Ryland: And so...   Everyone still talking...   Ryland: And so... but yeah   So on and so forth lol 😅
I don't use TikTok either
lmao him reframing losing an audience and tons of money and having to sell his shit to get by as "just changing priorities" is so fn funny
🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ I guess everyone is cool with supporting someone who openly talked about preying on children and made many sexual comments about children. More then that sadly. He even admitted doing unconsensual sexual things to the younger children in his neighborhood when he was a teen growing up. I'm just mind blown that people are supporting someone like this.
As long as you don’t say “they or them, you’ll be fine” I’m weak 😂
Hear me out an eyeshadow palette about the podcast
Watching in 2025 and I am SO happy Shane and Ryland didn't listen to Jeffrey Star about YouTube sucking. I have never even used TikTok or other social media but I ❤ YouTube!!! I only discovered Shane and Ryland about 4 years ago and have been obsessed ever since and if they stopped filming for YouTube I would be very very sad and upset
i live in Wyoming!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I love this video! The entire editing, I cried 😭
21:43 this part was so funny I cannot 😭
I must be old af at 46 because I watch yt almost everyday
JS is so happy and excited to show one of his bff his new home
The woman that bought hood house really did it justice and made it even more beautiful than it was and I love it
Jeffree is hilarious😂😂
Elton John!! 😂😂😂
trixie and kayta need to do Heartstopper season 3
2025?
Hope the friendship between you and Jefree lasts!
Spending my 1/365 of 2025 rewatching this😅
It’s a very humbly, very healthy environment for Jeffree star💖💖🌌🌟
Ok i watch youtube everyday n I loooove Jeffree, Shane, Ryland vlogs, Morgan vlogs, shane's podcast squad minus Sandi n Lizzie ~Dec 30th, 2024
❤❤❤❤
You got me
What cringeworthy over dramatic voiceovers from Voldemort, it’s just make up and a chance to fleece your fans again ffs!  These two grifters deserve each other. They will never find real happiness.
This is sick
To Shane and Jeffree - I still love watching you both on YouTube and I wish you would do another palette and series about it. You would MAKE Youtube popular again with that.
Lol when jeffree pulled the gun out, Shane's face, everything 😂
I absolutely loved the beautiful world with jeffree star ⭐.
54:35 🧍🏼‍♀️me jus watching this video for the 30th time after it was uploaded 2 years ago. ‘No one is clicking’
Awww
It’s almost 2025 and I STILL love YouTube and come to YouTube on a weekly basis 😊
has jeffree star met yalls babys yet
2 years!
Shane and Ryland are so sickeningly fake.
Man Jeffree really is living the dream. I don't even just mean the 600 acres of lucrative yak farm lmao is it not literally everyone's dream to come home to a house full of cute little dogs? 😂
I actually really appreciate jeffree including the little bit about never holding your finger on the trigger bc it's literally the number one like safety rule or whatever with guns and its shocking how many people hold a gun like that. Even people who act like they're super into guns and experienced and shit. It's scary.
Dude Wisconsin looks cool af. I always think of Minnesota as the cool Midwestern state (somewhat north Dakota in recent years solely bc Scott Cramer has convinced me lmao always making really cool videos doing cool shit there) but man Wisconsin seems pretty sweet. It's beautiful first off.. but also I had no idea it had such a low population and to someone like me, a socially awkward/anxious introvert who is scared to talk to strangers.. this sounds amazing 😂
Jeffree said "why have big house when big yard do trick?"
I miss the old youtube beauty community so fucking much. The perpetual drama that came from those same big like 10 or so youtubers was insane and I feel privileged to have been there to watch it all play out 😂😂😂 man those were the days..
38:21 not The Hobbit playing in the background! <3
I love Shane but his “oh my god” annoys me
comfort series
I'm sorry they're playing really loose with that gun Hope it's not loaded
Jeffree: "No one cares about YouTube." My husband: "Can we watch something other than YouTube?"
He said youtube sucks. New conspiracy vid- "vicky gets turbo cancer" Theres the title for shitn n gigs
a cold redbull and a glass of ketamine 💀
Am I the only one that noticed that Jeffrey seems more masculine living there?
I love YouTube. Definitely my most used app.. all day everyday with that shit
"Because of my cancelation, his make up palette ended up on the shelves at TJ Max"... WAS SO REAL OMG, I ABOUT DIED. 😂❤
Ryland is such a vibe!! And so is the cameraman!! ❤
I am all over anything that involves the paranormal. So intrigued by it all.
I love this video ❤❤❤
october 2024 - HAVE YOU MADE THE HAUNTED WYOMING SERIES YET???? WE ARE WAITING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I find your life fascinating!  I hope you never stop; the whole slowdown has an ebb and a flow; people will reengage because they do that.  You share your life and times and story and creations is Iconic and won't ever get dull.  Please don't stop!  Love you sharing all of you!!
fuck i want that hummer so bad
so this is what rich people do
Jeffrey,  so proud you. Congratulations for all you have done and continue to do. Love you.
He’s like YouTube sucks no one watches anymore… YouTube is the only thing I watch
Shane hoping to get another pallette collab as his income has disappeared 😂😂
lmao did anyone notice the last clip ryland tries to get a word in over jeffree and finally when he starts talking at the end the music cuts him off and the video ends😭🤣
Jeffree bihhh Thanos died 😩😭
😢
I love how Jeffree just causally went from selling makeup to selling yak meat
I don’t care how cancelled Jeffree and Shane are. I will always love them and they are my comfort series.
Hi how are U! When are we going to to get the Shane and Jeffree ghost hunting videos series????
53:17 - heartbreaking.
I love the state of Wyoming. I left Arizona 2 years ago and never missed it back home. I love Wyoming I see the Grand Tetons a lot but it never gets old..
I can’t believe I’ve only just seen this!   I LOVE this for Jeffree😍 slow living is my dream. He’s so down to earth and I’m so happy for him.
Jeffree is such an impressive person to me. It seems like he makes gold out of lead all the time. He got cancelled so many times and all he has done with that is growing his empire more and more and more. Reaching the freedom to leave and get rid of all you have to do your own thing and still always stay just as successful is something only a handful of people can do. And he’s not even scared of it, instead he just owns it. Absolutely amazing and admirable.
I still think the doomsday palette would sell like hot cakes, I think if yall did collab again, I'd definitely be first in line for it, and I know many others would too. Neither of you are canceled. You're still loved ❤
I'm ALWAYS revisiting old random Jeffree videos, especially when I'm doing my cleaning or need something to carry me through tedious work, he helps me through and it puts a smile on my face LOL!!
I still don’t know why you guys didn’t release the pallet. I missed the part on what happened.
So cool to hear Jeffree and Shane say “madi” is so cool lmao that’s my name
I really want haunted videos 😂
Yeah you tube does suck without you Jeffree, Come on Jeffree , your the Madonna of YouTube. You've done every thing in vlogs and looks & your no idiot, That's why you did what you had to do on Tic-toc, You know your audience and your costumers, so you know how you need to delegate you time. ❤❤❤
I just love watching them in videos, I do wish Shane and Jeffree can make another video I know they are still friends so it be so nice to see them in one video again.
Why is the background music so loud :(
150 yaks and I've finally leveled out, 8 dogs, we're done now. I felt that lol I want every animal I see!
Anyone else still hoping for a ghost hunting collab with Shane and Jeffree?
ryland is so….god
^-^🖤
I guess those of us that still do watch on YouTube or losers to you..? Nice to know😢
Jeffree saying no one watches Youtube anymore, I don't watch anything else, honestly. I consumed more YT during the pandemic than anything else.
Jeffrey⭐ is an amazing-free soul💗
What was the name of the video he showed a clip of at the beginning of 1:12
It’s 2024, and I’ve never given up on YouTube :,(…… this has been my favorite since 2014 😢… and I will miss the OGs 😢…I was 14 when I found YouTube. Now I’m 24 lol
I mean I get what Jeffree is saying about YouTube. Yes I’m still on it but I rewatch a lot of old content and never really anyone new or anything. I watch your videos or his or tanas or Trisha’s. The OGs
I'm just waiting for Jeffree and Shane to just get married
53:36 Yeaaaa, Jeffree, it's not that people aren't watching youtube anymore, people just aren't watching you, bud
Kinda shallow of jeffree to only be about clicks thought he was more down to earth than that
Hearing YouTube is dead just took me to a whole different world this world has took everything to a whole different level everyone is slowly becoming phone addicted no one actually goes outside everything is just slowly becoming this sad place that everyone is becoming stuck In
Pls launch stuff together again I beg I need another pallet
Why im getting this recommended now idk, but fine ill watch it.. again 😂
I love love love Jeffrey and Shane together!
The ending hit hard because I watch you tube still. I love Jeffrees yak farm. I've wanted to live in bfe for a long time.
People grow and change and it’s bitter sweet
Buffy, thought he meant the series lol
Nit jeffree with the silencer🤫
Did jeffree remove his bbl or butt implants?? His booty looks smaller and more natural??
Jeff deciding he’s the authority on YouTube.  Funny but this video had over 4 million views at the same time he said “NO ONE watches anymore.    Ummmmmm……sorry Jeff but you’re wrong.
You look so good with or without make up!
you two brings out the best in each other. naturally funny and genuine friendship
And we have officially reached, BYE FELICIA
How do we spell HYPOCRITE?  Pretty sure, it's spelled, JEFFREE STAR.
Think he's gorgeous just bare faced
Wish I could hang with Jeffree he seems super cool
Literally all I watch is YouTube. No streaming, no tik tok.
It took me almost to the end of the video to figure out why Jeffree looked so different to me (other than he looks healthy and happy)...he has eyebrows!!!  😆🤣
Jeffery saying you tube sucks I can see what he means but also tik tok kind of sucks too a little bit
its been so long i cant even remember what jeffrey did to get cancelled
I think people was way to hard on Jeffery, now was he wrong with some of the things he said and done, Yes! But did he deserve the amount of hate, cancelation, and very evil and vile things said and did to him no! I hate how we pick and choose who gets to be the hero and who gets to be the villain. I just feel like Jeffery shouldn't leave🥺 I've been with him for what 15 yrs I think, yeah 15 or 16 yrs I watched him create a lane for not only the beauty world but for content creators, this hurts my feelings so bad JEFFERY MIGHT NOT EVER SEE MY COMMENT BUT IF HE EVER DOES I WANT U TO KNOW I LOVE YOU, I STAND WITH U AND I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU GAVE US🥰😘❤️
Just watching this and cannot believe it's been a year already and even more since the first video you've made with Jeffree. He's such a sweet soul and I'm glad he's found true happiness!
We just lost MatPat, and now Jeffrey Starr😢😢😢
"Haven't seen you since the car accident. Let's go 0 to 60 in the hummer!"
35:04 omg the reaction to the ranch doors opening like mclaren doors was crazy
21:48 lol everyone's reaction to the pistol with a suppressor on it lol 😂
Jeffree sincerely looks at peace and his skin and face looks like healthy without makeup now, yknow? I feel before when he didn’t have makeup he looked so warm down, I’m so happy for him. 🥹
I’m personally going through a lot in my life right now and I often watch Shane’s videos of him and Jeffree cause it brings me so much happiness and joy and remembering the joy of watching the OG videos when they came out. I love how these two got away from the evils, grew from the bs that happened and importantly learned. Now they look so much happier and I love that for them.
Shane i need that haunting series in Wyoming please. When i say need i mean NEED ASAP 😂❤
I love him he’s so amazing fully support J⭐️
stop.. im starting to watch again.. im going back to my roots too jeffree
Never thought someone could make farming unrelatable
I'M LIKE YOU SHANE,  I KNOW. 😓 I DON'T HAVE TIKTOK ANYMORE I STILL WATCH YOUTUBE! I LOVE YOU TUBE! GOOD JOB JEFF,  AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE AND CHERISH YOU BOTH!
I love jeff he gives me hope  that I can do anything in this world forever have my love ❤
I guess no matter how many dramas they’ve been through,, I admire their friendship a lot ,❤❤it feels genuine,, its standing the test of time
Im watching this on YouTube… hmmm lol
I would love to kick it and chill with Jeffree at the ranch
omg Id love a video of Jeffree meeting the twins, Jet and Max! It would be so special
I used to live in Casper.. but I missed my home town in Montana.  I love my state so much. Its cool how much he has changed. He gets to see how peaceful it is living in a small city. Sooo peaceful. I love my small city of just over than 100,000 people. As an ex Casper resident I love the respect he's shown Wyoming.
What r you talking about no one watches youtube for enjoyment anymore? Lol ive been watching it since like 2010 for enjoyment and am still watching it for enjoyment
why are they friends
Miss u guys
i dont know if its only me, but every time i see shane and jefrree´s video´s theres a smile on my face the entire video
I love this Jeffree
"No one watches YouTube anymore." Me: *Spending 70 hours a week watching YouTube Videos* "Hi, my name is No one."
wkreceni isss goood fo my
Shane and Jeffree ft. a paranormal content!!!!!!!! That would be bomb!!!!!
YouTube is still very popular, but if you want to sell your makeup and cosmetics to kids.  The spoiled rotten kids of rich Mom and Dads that are constantly working, give their 10 year olds carte blanch to buy what they want.  There are countless vids of those brats going into Sephora and trashing out the testers , opening products, stealing and some 10 year olds and as young as 6 year olds that have their Mom or Dad’s credit card and they just charge $500.00 worth of stuff to be the cool kids at school.  It’s insane and you feed that insanity by just being on tic toc. It is mostly young kids there watching your videos and saying ..I need this.  They have no self control and are a wrecking ball to families just trying to get by with both parents working all day like slaves. You promote this bullshit by going on stupid tic toc and promoting your products there.  So you were pissed on by youtube a few times and cancelled over stupid shit that you did. to yourself...get over it already! 🌟
I watch YouTube pretty much only
Why would he sell meat omg and than eat it. :((
So sad to hear YouTube is dead 😢
Okaa but the “how did the movie end?” 😂😭😭 devastatingly🤣
I’ve edited down to YouTube only the last year and it has been great and freeing af ❤❤❤
Literally need more videos of Shane and Jeffree Star ❤love your chemistry!
A true Scorpio and cancer friendship ❤️
I still care Jeffrey
not him getting shane's prints all over the gun HAHA
@ 21:44 - Shane freaks out because hes never been around a gun, in any capacity. That he nervously laughs with fear.   Me- “Ooooooohhh… I wanna go SHOOT that RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!” The power that I would be holding in my hand, the feeling is like no other.    Also, this moment shows why I am a fan of Jeffree’s. Because he’s kind of like me in a way. He’s gay, but he LOVES BIG TRUCKS, and GUNS!!! He also loves “Basketball,” and sports. I love that about him.
Damn, but what if they did like a podcast palette?👀
I just watched this nasty video about Shane saying he was attracted to babies, sicko!!
I still have my pallet and REGRET not saving for more of the collection. Its the pallet I reach for first, even for blush.
Don’t watch these videos this person is a zoo file and a pdf file
Shane and Jeffree have the best energy together, times have changed, they are not the same as they were back in 2019, but who is, i just love seeing them together, brings so much joy, thank you Shane for these series
I CANNOT with Shane’s overacting UGH
Jeffrey is crazy, love him
Watching this a year later and truly you guys friendship is special. And Jeffree is naturally hilarious ❤
Hey yo! All I watch is youtube!
I watch youtube for fun, and I'll miss you Jeffree <3
Jeffree let's create a Canadian Pallette Will Be Epic totally !!
Jeffery is sadly right… YouTube isn’t the same. I find myself longing for more videos on YouTube but nothing really captures my attention anymore.
How am I ONLY just watching this now👀
He's so cute as a guy......
Wowwww, honestly I never thought I’d see the day Jeffree would be this grounded. So proud of him!!
my bf's family- his great grandpa was one of the first settlers in the valley in Wyoming. They still have his house till today- and its FREAKING haunted dude. No one is allowed to go upstairs. I learned the hard way. We were sleeping on the couch downstairs in the living room, and out of nowhere, the upstairs door creaked open, and a football came tumbling down. We can hear feet running around in the ceiling, and sometimes children. THERES NO KIDS AT THE HOUSE. Just us adults. Lots of Native American spirits and people died in Wyoming 😬😳😱😨
Jeffrey You are fully better see ❤ You are beautiful. You are art ❤ Seen you have a lot.....🎉
4mil on this upload is substantially lower than previous content, I get it BUT it highlights that all viewers - loyal ones to this day - are just a number. "NO ONE WATCHES ANYMORE, YOUTUBE IS SHIT," shits on all of us that do watch.
I love when celebrities find what our daily lives look like and fall in love with the small town country vibe❤️makes me more appreciative of what ive always known.
Why do I feel like I just watched this last month?
I would watch Jeffrey n Shane literally all day every day
It's the STARCADE
I love this so much I wanna go to Wyoming
You all are so much fun to be around. Thanks for the lift . I like the other times too. It's the full gambit.
Where is that Rainbow Rodeo I have heard about? It's unfortunate but sometimes us queers have to defend ourselves.  I really hate violence, but gave had some times where I had to defend me. My past training came in handy for defending my life but it stills hurts that I had to.
Jeffree is kind of right about YouTube, it was one of my downtime before the pandemic but now, all the YouTubers that I used to follow don't make a lot of videos anymore so now I am just video surfing here and there. Kind of the sad reality truth.
Finally, he woke up...
Not gonna lie, Jeffree got so shadow banned, I would watch every DAY, but all of the sudden it disappeared from my to watch lists.... and yes I'm subscribed.
Absolutely love this! ❤
Idc what nobody says…this new energy he has is beyond amazing 🙌🏾
~ 40:13 … I feel like I can see Soul in Jeffrey’s eyes again. It’s really beautiful. 🥲  Amazing what reconnection can do for a person. We should learn from this. ❤︎
I miss Jeffrey on YouTube
I’m so happy for Jeffery! 🖤💗🖤💗🖤
Wait where’s the Shane 2 palette ???
I care about youtube 😭😭
Jeffree you inspire me to not care anymore of what people say to me, or talk about me. How you now are seems so at peace and I want that and maybe I can get that too :)
What a great transformation of peace and tranquility! You still have your humor and of course your beauty. I've always loved that your so honest and deep. Loved watching your videos, your love for animals and your friends is deep. That my friend is rare! You are a super soul and thank you for sharing your life, love and fantastic self..❤
Shane seams like an amazing friend.   But I’m so pleasantly surprised at how friendly and welcoming Jeffree is as well.
Lovvvve a RED state oxo
Listen country life is where it's at. Don't have Jeffree Star money? Get yourself about 20 acres stick a trailer on it and you will never regret it, not for a single moment.
We gotta bring YouTube back. My entire upbringing era is ending and it’s sad. Jenna’s gone. Jeffrees gone. There’s no emo hair tutorials anymore. Christina grimmies tragedy happened. I’m just distraught. 😭😭
NO ME AND MY MOM LIVE ON HIM I'M GOING TO DIE WITHOUT HIM 😭😭😭😭
Hearing jeffree say no one cares about him on YT honestly broke my heart, I used to love ending the night with a jeffree video :/
Jeffree looks sooooo healthy and happy! That smile!!!!! 🥰🥰 It makes me super happy!
i will always watch Jeffreys youtube videos
I’m still here, watching YouTube. Watching and enjoying the content that lots of my favorite creators are making! Love you guys so so much!!🥺💜💜
No one is watching youtube anymore, except me. I love youtube.
You don't know how happy this video made me!! <3
Still here watching YouTube ❤
sometimes i lose my self in these jeffree and shane spirals
Can someone please remind me, why they got cancelled, I truly don’t remember what happened
I’ve watched these videos back to back more times than I can count. I never do that with anyone else. The internet destroyed the dynamic duo over jealousy. It’s upsetting. I love you two so much and if by chance Jeffree or Shane is reading this.. please don’t forget you have tons of silent supporters. I’m one of them and have been for years ❤️
What’s so sad is it YT would just STOP trying to control what creators posted, if they would STOP messing with the algorithm, if they would just let creators create & not be assholes about their platform, then the creators wouldn’t be shifting platforms. I said it a long time ago when YT started censoring what creators could & couldn’t do, when they started forcing creators to make family friendly content vs just being able to freely speak, I said another streaming platform is gonna come along & there’s gonna be a switch up, then YT is gonna be begging creators to come back, they are gonna wonder what they did. And I’ve seen other creators say they’ve spoken with YT & YT asked them what they wanted, how they can update their short form etc. Now YT is just a 2nd thought. Short content is made & posted to TikTok & then they say “Oh ya, go ahead and post it to YT if you want”. YT is trying to shift to short content while TikTok is extending video lengths. YT did it to themselves.
I’m so sad! I wanted this palette release SO bad!!! I’m praying they release it still 😢
Imagine Jeffrey Star approving meat in the United States of America. Then going global . Jeffrey if you do it, I want credit lol. Love u .
Going through the stress of DIA to fly to Wyoming!!! Crazy I rather drive lmao but you do you boo
Shane, 😅 he’s doomed from YouTube 😅
Jeffree just whipping out a gun with a suppressor 💀
yas
When a 1.1 million dollar home is assumed as a.....normal house????!!!
I feel like neither Shane or Jeffree are " horrid people"  like what others have said. I would kill to do an interview w Shane personally. Cancel culture isn't cute at all.  Sorry I said it, it's mostly kids and teens that are  "cancelling" everyone.... Why can't "cancel culture" be dropped off the deep end....like these aren't humans at the end of the day.
I have never ate yak , and  never will 😮
Holy shit I absolutely do not believe YouTube is dead what the actual fuck are you talking about  I don't know, I just believe there's more to YouTube than originally meets the eye
Rural Wyoming looks like rural Nevada 😂 so jeffree lives like us country folks now 😅
I love YouTube I hate watching TikTok’s really sad to see content creators think we don’t care anymore. 💔
Rewatching this after todays video.  I will die for a Scorpio palette. 🦂♏️❤
It warms my heart that he’s so happy and humble now fr
I absolutely love your humor 😂
Simple video of make up for people who are not working and need to be entertained.
I just found you and you are quitting. I wanted to see your make tutorials.
SO? 😂
LMAO when Jeffree killed the bug 💀
Jefree i love this you!! Ive always loved you but to see you with your yaks and dogs out in Wyoming.... Im so happy for you!!!
Your friendship is super cute! ❤❤❤
JS is so handsome
Insane how much better Jeffrey treats Chris than Ryland and that other bish.
I haze myself for watchin this
As each of jeffrees current videos have at least 1 million views.
As each of jeffrees current videos have at least 1 million views.
I LOVE seeing Jeffree and Shane back together again!! Yasss!!! Jeffree I’m so excited to see you really happy!! Keep doing you baby, True Happiness looks So good on you 🩷
Shane and Jeffrey's friendship is sooooo funny and relatable. They can go without seeing eachother for months, even years and still be as close as ever when they see eachother again. Honestly, it's exactly like this with my best friend and I
Jeffery quitting YouTube! Nooooo just take a mental health break and just do a video here and there don't quit all together us old bitches still like YouTube .... Lol
🎉🎉 good job Jeffrey detox from all the toxicity.   Being grounded humbles you.  It's not all about the money and fame.
SOOOOOOOO ⭐
Two thousand and late called they want their hair back.
I’m hoping to see Shane drop a new series with Jeffree soon. JEFFREE…PLEASE COME BACK TO YOUTUBE!!!!
Where did all those purses go? OH MY GOD to even have 1 or even make up would be sooooooo EPIC!!!! I’ve never been able to afford Jeffery star
Awee I watch this for enjoyment 😢 like I’m doing now. I wish there was more because I love seeing Jeffree in his home and seeing cool things rich people have and do that I can’t. Let me live through you!! Lol 😂😂
Makeup ended up tjmaxx hahahahah
Bro I’m on YouTube every day literally almost all day, anytime i have free time my most used app is definitely YouTube, as a 25 year old.. people are definitely still craving good content on this app and i love watching good, long videos still. Sad to hear creators quit
As a Texan it's hilarious seeing these cali boys shook af seeing those guns on the counter as if they'd magically come to life and start offing people LMFAO
37:14 Jeffree looks so good here like idk how to describe it he’s so handsome 😮
I Have To Say, This was such a Drastic Change For Jefree, Ive Got To Say Its Enspiring to Watch.
Casper, Wy is an AMAZING place! I spent a lot of time working there years ago and it was such an amazing place! Wonderful video, as a someone new to your content I’m 🤯 you held my attention for a majority of the whole video! Subscribed!!
I still watch YouTube religiously as tv when I get home .. that made me sad
Not buying it ! It's not real talk, juste advertisement ! COME ON DUDE
I remember when the first series shook Youtube... it was major !
I still watch youtube :(
Love Jeffree and Shane so so much ❤️
Watching this feels like reuniting with my old friends 🙁 I grew up watching them 🙁
I'm loving this.  So many iconic sayings "Finally levelled out" I adore you guys.  Now I have done some travel in my life...why weren't MY arrivals like this dammit!!!  It's coz I didn't go to Casper!!!
yuck
Watching this, and after the pandemic, tie-dye is not a phase. It’s a lifestyle 😍
The fact I’m nine months late shows Jeffree was right. I needed a tik tok break 😂
I missed this soooo much. I couldn’t with the little piece of jeffrees hair coming out the hat
PLS DONT QUIT YT
NO
I have loved watching Jeffree move through his different chapters...
maddie is fake
Hi i need more of all of you together. You guys just work. ❤
Idc how many times these two have been cancelled I’ve always loved them and really will and ryland is everything lol
Can we talk about how can talk about how some people can move their eyebrows 😮 Some people cannot
I like the new Jeffree. I think he’s damn close to becoming a conservative! I do miss his YouTube videos though but happy he is finding some peace.
So heartwarming to see personal growth journey.
Ok your gates are sickening!!!
I have watched 2 entire videos on your channel. To comment on the last thing Jeffery said on here - ya no one is "clicking" anymore .. I think because the videos are waayyyy too long
Please don't stop youtube i care ❤
OMG! I couldn't figure out why Jeffree looked so different. It's the brows! He's got brows! Love it.
RIP Diva! ❤
Seeing his expensive ride dirty and covered in bugs... is LIFE.
Jeff is so wrong. YouTube is the foundation of the internet. Never dies
dying
I’m so happy for Jeffree to finally be at peace with himself
Gosh I loved JS back in the day and I Absolutely love the new JS!!!!!  He’s a big boy now!!!! With an amazing honest heart.  ❤
Shane you need to do a haunted series with jeffree before you have children.
You are absolutely right! This looks completely fake and staged. Also, drama won't happen unless you and Jaffar make it happen. Mindblowing, I know...
“No one clicks anymore” but the video has 3 million views
Jeffrey in his Hannah Montana era
Being canceled these days is a cakewalk because everybody’s gonna look at his videos and he still going to get millions of views which equals millions of dollars so this is bullshit😊
The way I still come to shane and jeffree for enjoyment
In all seriousness, Jeffree does seem like such a genuine person, no beating round the bush, he just says it how it is and isn’t afraid to be honest because he doesn’t have anything to lose by being honest on YouTube, it’s not like it’s his main source of income that he’s reliant on, or that he’s scared of his reputation being ruined, I feel like it makes him surprisingly trust worthy.
I feel they will launch the pallette
Love you on YouTube!!! Don’t quit
im finding myself leaving tik tok and coming back to youtube. im tired of the ads and im tired of the people just promoting dumb stuff. I think i prefer videos like this one. i love seeing the behind the scenes and the hard work. It makes me more excited
Jeffree is a breath of fresh air!!! Every stage of his life we have watched him grow and evolve. I love seeing everyone happy and thriving.
Love you guys 💕
Am sorry but everyone makes mistakes, past or present or future, we are all only human, he could of done a hell of a lot worse like most of the YouTubers we know, I only came upon this channel and that today and binge watched all of it including the drama, and you know what…… I bloody love these guys and this channel!!! So wholesome and funny as hell all of them! Such great people!!! Keep strong Shane and family you are all incredible!! Definitely a subscriber here that’s for sure! Keep being you!! ❤❤❤
i haven't watched them in years idk how to feel about them
the ending of this video made me so sad because youtube is my favorite thing in the whole world and i would click every single video any of you guys put out.
im a whole 39 minutes in and just realized  Jeffree got eyebrows
what is with the camera work though
Right now the video I wanna see is as Shane suggested, where Jeffree drinks alcohol and Shane gets high.
What is the song at 36:20????
I am 🤣 but I like to be different anyway haha 😄 x
20:48 cracked me up
i love jeffrey he just speaks his mind
The dog poo on the floor was very humbling 😌
bad content
wait maddy getting high with jeffree omg i’m jealous i want her job
the Bible talks about how sinful for man to dress like woman and vice versa .  I've also heard the filthy words come out of jefries mouth.  sad you all praise a man who is obviously a lost soul!  We should all take a look within you are the company you keep
You and Jefree are so friend goals I wish I had a friend like that, feeling like i could be my genuine self with…
Baby u the baddest
Im happy for Jefree!
Love you
No one watches? What?! YouTube is still a great app to go watch stuff for free!! What?! No Jeffree you can't quit YouTube. Watching You literally takes me out of my life and get to imagine how to life a multi million dollar life... But still im watching!!!
17:02 as long as you don't use "They and Them" 🤣🤣🤣 I'm dying!
Omg he’s right
I care about YOUTUBE! I love you Jeffery Star and Shane too!
I will see ya on the tic Toc!
People forget the HARD WORK it takes to be a human. Like the self actualization process, learning who and what you need to surround yourself with. It’s brutal and it’s unfortunate that many humans have not gone through this process. You are both truly strong human beings and I can feel the healthy vibes!!!
I love speeding! I have a Mercedes and it kits 60 in 4 seconds!
Jeffery it’s so nice that you’re wanting to be grounded and not so materialistic. Even though you have the best of everything including your best self. Shane brings the best out of you he’s a keeper!
That gun OMFG!!!!!
I used to have only ONE horse and people have no idea how physically demanding it is to care for huge animals. I was a foster parent for a dog rescue too. I totally get that farming is hard work but it can be life changing!
Wow Shane! This is my first time meeting you and you remind me of the personality my group when I was in high school! I miss my friends so much! We would dance at TRAX, The Fox Hole, and BJ’s in Denver. Nice meeting you.
I like this version of jeffree. He's so charismatic and funny now when he is authenthic. Back then he was so theatrical and fake, so exagerated. Now he is very down to earth. I like that .
I casted this on my TV and my two year old kept calling Jeffree Star mom and Shane dad on the thumbnail LOL
I feel that Jeffrey is doing better he's in his element Something just feels a bit off about Shane
pleaseee do a paranormal haunted video about Wyoming with Jeffree!!
The pandemic brought me back to YouTube.
rest easy diva <3
Can i be your new camera guy?
This is really a testament to how people will accept you no matter what if you’re a decent neighbor and a hard worker and you have respect for what you have and what other people have! The cali people eat themselves! There’s a whole world out there that does not think the way they do. If you’re in a place where you’re being treated badly or being judged, just know, that’s not the majority! I live a completely opposite life of Jeffreestar but I still love him and his videos. I would love to hang with him on his ranch just as buds. I’m so happy for him and I have mad respect for him…I hope this makes sense to people.
this new cameraman?
I refuse tik tok I have been waiting to watch ur videos I love to hear about urban lives
I'm still watching ❤😮
So true I only came to YouTube to see if u had conspiracy videos because I missed them but if u had shorts on tictoc I'd be there lolololol damnnn
You know you've made it when you just don't give a shit about money or proving materialistically that you have money. All the 1% live that way now
Jeffree is so happy and healthy. So glad to see it.
Going to see Jeffree is like going to see the Wizard 😂❤
I’m so happy for Jeffree at first I was like why did he leave la😭 but I see how happy he is
Where’s the haunted videos with Jeffree?
Shane with a Glock is such a powerful image 😂😂
THIS CAMERA PERSON NEEDS TRAINING
JEFFREE COME BACK I’m still here watching YouTube !!! 😂😂 but seriously come back!!
All this money and things with no one to share it with other than people that want to use you Jeffery grab your children 😢
Okay I'll be real I dislike this video... And then I liked it... Because it was you... And because I love the style of the video... However I'm so sad about Jeffree Stars quitting YouTube... It makes me very sad but that's not your fault so you don't deserve a thumbs down
Hope Jeffree got his tax stamp for that suppressor.  Otherwise showing it off on camera like that is really, really stupid.
Super proud of you Jeffree Star!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I loved seeing Jeffree again. I think the last video I saw of him is when he and his boyfriend split up. He is so much less pretentious - even before he mentioned getting rid of his bags and stuff I could absolutely see the change. He is on the right path.
Haunted Series!
Love Jeffrey! Glad he’s grown so much.
You flew on my birthday ! August 16th babyyyy 🎉❤
Ghost hunting with Jeffrey would be so much fun to watch
Ok hear me out. I hear emperor Kuzko when Jeffery speaks
I watch Youtube every evening... don't recognise what Jeffree is saying :(
I love YouTube
I love Jeffree, anyone can say whatever they want about him, but of all creators/influencers I watch he’s probably the most humble
Omg im CRYINGGGGGGG. Jeffery is just so energetic and happy it’s radiating !!! AHHHHH THEY ARE BACKKKKK IMA CRYYYYYYY
Love this, and love you guys always. <3
Where did u get ur phone case?
Yo jeffree is hilarious 😂 why didn’t they release shames 2nd pallete tho???
I really wish Nate and jeffree stayed together 😢
Jeffrey ain’t messing around wit his guns everywhere 😂😂😂
Listen I LOVE these 2 together!!!!!❤
I can not believe YouTube took 6 months to let me know SHANE AND JEFFREE have another series! Are u kidding me Shane and jeffree are the only reason I watch long content on YT
How have I missed these videos?!! I love Shane and Jeffery and I’m just seeing this 6 months late!
Please do a ghost hunt with Jeffree!!!
9:22 has me WEEZING 😭😭😭
This makes me so sad I didn’t know Jeffrey star was basically retiring from yt🥹
Most of the reason people quit watching YouTube is because creators quit making regular content. I've watched every video Jeffree put up but yeah, when it's only a makeup launch every few months, it's not as much fun. I'm excited that Shane is finally making regular content again.
y’all when did jeffree get so funny🤣🤣
Jeffrey Star is astonishingly handsome😳 He seems very happy in Wyoming ❤️❤️❤️
is that a silencer on J stars gun😂
I still use youtube, tiktok is stressfull tbh, please dont leave
I would respect you so much more if you didn't work with Jeffrey at all, Jeffreys a POS. You kinda are too, but you aren't as bad as him. I miss the days when I loved your videos. Best regards
I still watch YouTube but am very selective.
I like Jeffree's new world. He's happy and grounded. Nothing like living in nature.
Chernobyl is back
I love the idea of them doing a haunted series together in Wyoming and Colorado it would be so funny and spooky and just amazing
I have all of j.s palettes and I will always be a fan of you all.
Flop
I freakin love the new Jeffree Starr! He is so humble and I love how he can finally be free and authentic💗
I watch YouTube all day then movies at night so some are still watching... and waiting
I miss Jeffery on YouTube 😢
Just seen this too thank you 🙏
Jeffree is handsome and gorgeous at the same time. I love the new him. And it’s great to see him just not give a fuck anymore. He has worked so hard to get where he is at and he deserves to just be.
I love ❤️ Shane and Ryland!
I still watch YouTube 😢 but I understand 😢
It sounds weird, but even though this series came out months ago, I love watching it like a re-run. Because you are one of my favorite YouTubers. 2nd is Morgan and 3rd is Ryland(Ryan)lol. Love y'all and keep posting vids!
This video is an odd overlay of a bunch of different timelines, stock footage and music montages from years old clips,  as well as footage from the previous video and there’s truly no point to it.   He gets ready and gets an Uber which is roughly the first twenty minutes of the video. Then he finally meets up with Jeffree, they mess around in the car/with a gun, for way too long. 30 minutes in and we are still traveling. They don’t bring up anything that we didn’t already know about. Finally at 35 minutes or so we get to Jeffree’s ranch. There’s actually a solid five minutes of advertising for Jeffree’s other palettes which is to be expected ofc. Also he started a yak meat business.   All in all, if you just want to listen to Jeffree and Shane talk about nothing for an hour, enjoy, otherwise save your time for something better because this was low effort content fr
Loved the soundtracks in this. Anyone else? I can make a list if people are interested
Omg yesssss Jeffree’s eyebrows 😍
shane don’t get any ideas about quitting youtube
I love the interior of this house so much more than his other homes
Broke my heart to hear that YouTube is dead 🥺 been watching since the time it came out and still watch now, it’s more personal and has this real charm to it
I am very happy that you are enjoying being in Wyoming!  The gate is wonderful,  I love the idea of how it opens.  I'm looking forward to your new building downtown this summer. Nice that you are taking an old building and giving it a second life.
People are REALLY into jerky😂 literally my families business for 40 years!
Awe I love seeing jefree like this
I love Jeffrey & Shane so happy see them do a collab video again-! Their friendship is absolutely genuine which is so rare when your A-1 celeb— also I have been dealing with spirit aka ghost since age 4- FYI— I know your beautiful mansion had some freaky things that occurred that Jeffrey never really spoke of, has a lot to do with souls from coming across negative people and or joining in occult like activities in his past like Quija board as “fun”- but un-be known to Jeffrey he has an attachment— but that’s neither here or there bc ironically I’m told Jeffrey is aware of attachment and laughs him off- I’m from Philadelphia— and just like Wyoming it is extremely haunted and as the Veil thins they become more and more prominent and able to allow us to know their around in videos photos in our depths”- aka or dimensions— surprising last in going to say is— good to know Jeffrey star is no longer as fearful of spirit/ghost as he once was—but I’m told Shane on the other hand gets freaked out and his anxiety is through roof— spirit clearly exclaimed that Shane was very concerned of his new home having any issues of malicious or Maleficent  spirits, luckily it isn’t, but I was told to relay that when submerged or drenched with the fear there of”- that is what you can, may and will attract! Try to stay enlightened— and so shall your life and the souls around you will not have malicious intent—-besides the normal demonic entities- which are of physical items or burial grounds or house foundations aka the soil-! Wish you both much Love 💗 and pray 🙏🏼 you continue to be successful in any and all endeavors life may throw your way💯🙏🏼❤️
Okay but I still come home and watch youtube and not Netflix or Prime
Honestly? I'd like to see a Jeffree Star/Jeremy Clarkson farming crossover.
Its so sad Jeffery is transphobic.. He and shanes videos always felt comforting but now i know id never actually be safe with them :(
shane i love the music u put in background. lowkey bangers. I loved in ur last vid u used "Route 101" by Damma
This comment section 😭😭😭
Lets have a glass of ketamine😂
Sorry Jeffrey but your wrong, my first choice is always youtube. Maybe just what he's creating on there is boring.
Hi much ♥️❤️🔥
Jeffree's new home and neighborhood is giving NOPE the movie vibes.
i am still watching. April 2023.
“Wow this feels like rehab……..I’ve never been, but…..”
I love that he's stays strapped and isn't afraid to show it
Jeffree looks more radiant than ever! Id imagine the quiet peace of his wyoming ranch has done his soul wonders. Jeffree speaking of "decluttering" all his handbag,  shoes & clothing collections really speaks of growing maturely from his past.  They say broken ppl collect material things in place of all the people they have lost ....so im happy for jeffree being able to let go of all that past baggage.  Thank you so much Shane for the update!!
WHEN JEFFREE PULLED OUT THE GUN I WAS STUNNED, IT SEEMED SO OUT OF CHARACTER AND OUT OF POCKET ☠️☠️☠️
I watch YouTube 24/7 I kinda care😢
You guy’s crack me up!! Hi from Brisbane 💗
It’s so crazy to watch this because I grew up in casper, just moved to Florida, and to just see my tiny town broadcasted on a channel so big and seeing you show these places where I have memories is so crazy
Ive been following jeffree since BOTDF emo days😅 i was so happy to see him thriving in make up and i felt bad when his old shit came and bit him in the ass bc he was truly a different person back in his emo/scene era, mostly bc of the toxic ppl he was around. Now seeing yet another evolution of jeffree, its just so inspiring. Im truly happy that he has finally found some peace in life. When he mentioned the paranormal stuff i thought it would be so fun to have a little series of the gang exploring and sharing some of the history behind those places. Youtube maybe dying lol but Shane, you have 19M subscribers and 3M views on this video. Just keep being yourself and creating content. Maybe invest in yourself something like wine, your own soda/energy drink, weightloss journey/protein/suppliments, restraunt, food critique, a club, fashionable clothes for plus sized ppl(im plus sized so i know how  hard it can be to find cute clothes that dont make me look like a middle aged parent.) Whatever your future ventures are, just make sure its something youre passionate about. Travel or take time on jefree's ranch to ground yourself so you can also evolve. Ppl will always judge your past but if your sucesses from your evolution out weighs the bad then theres nothing to be scared about. There will always be haters in your industry that dont want to see you thriving. All that matters is you and rylan's (sorry if i mispelled it lol) happiness. i truly wish the best for you and csnt wait to see what more shane dawson can do❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖 keep your head up and continue to be the strong person you are.
I love the eyebrows on Jeffree. I think cause it’s new to me.
Jefferee Your Transition Is Just Truly Inspirational To Me! You Did The Dam Thing And Still Doing It! Much Love And Best Of Luck From My End! ❤
Some how I just love and trust Jeffree
HASHSHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH SHANE AND JEFFREE JUST BEING ICONIC,.. THEY AND THEM ARE BS...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
i love youtube still and love the change you made
We need a Jeffree Yak Star ranch podcast ❤
I’m honestly loving the new Jeffree and Shane ❤️💙
7:45
It’s very annoying when somebody is talking seriously and others are making stupid jokes and laughing all the time. How does Jeffry can stand this I don’t know.
P e r f e c t
Inner peace is priority.
54:33  at least millions of people watch his videos!! I'm lucky to get like 5 views on my videos ROFL 🤣😥😭
i stopped watching youtube.  too much ads. Thats the main reason its annoying. Tiktok has less ads. hx repeats itself. Television and then Internet-Youtube- now Tiktok. I personally search Shane today to see whats up. i dont get any recommendations too from them all so i forgot about them
Please don’t quit Shane :( been watching you since I was 16 and I’m fucking 22 years old now. You’re so real on here and all your true fans appreciate that.
Me watching this YouTube video for entertainment and enjoyment:👁️👄👁️  Jeffrey star: No one cares anymore 🙂
* i feel really safe it is really normal * well
me watching this video on youtube jeffrey: No OnEs wAtChInG
PLEASE Jeffree x Shane haunting video!!
i love how im eating kfc and watching this 🤣
God l’d love to live in a place like that, only 8 neighbours that’s my idea of heaven. ❤
All of Jeffries videos have millions of views but here he is saying that nobody watches his videos it just shows how out of touch these people are like I get 3000 views and I’m like holy shit so many people watched my content
I thought jeffree and Shane weren’t friends … am I late ?
“I have a name so I’m fine!” 😂😂😂😂
Whipping out the gun w suppressor In The airport parking lot was wild😂😂
https://youtu.be/NSpSNx5U4sw
I’m curious as to what the intro song is 😂
So happy for you! You look amazing and you are such an amazingperson. Wish you all the success I adore you and glad you are really happy! Much Love to you!!
https://youtu.be/vmudisRy3ds
He kinda has a point- ppl have left youtube. But if Jenna came back, so would everyone else
29:38 Lol
I love this relaxed Jeffree
when its 430am and im watching jeffree explaining safe trigger practices
The end Shane was hit with reality
When money buys u happiness Iconic 😂❤
I am a Johnny come lately to the Jeffree/Shane "movement" and I swear, I am here for it all day long! Watching yall while I was going through one of the strangest times of my life ,and it just allowed me to get away from the madness for just a bit.  I would love to see more collabs in the future bc It really just works. ❤❤
It’s 2023 and I still come to YouTube
I had so much going on I didn’t even know about this video till tonight.   I laughed, I cried, and I missed all of your unique personalities.   I’m sorry for the lateness but thank you so much Shane and family for this video. ❤️
Jeffery has a beautiful smile
I love that Jeffree is growing up and realizing money doesn't buy happiness ❤
We love the second amendment 🙌🏻 it's the ultimate equalizer ❤ 🇺🇸 and I love seeing a responsible gun owner and operator

How about a episode where he goes ghost hunting for reals with (Sam and Colby) 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀 EDIT: WITH JEFFERY ❤️😩
Anyone else think Shane likes jeffery
now i wanna live in wyoming since it’s haunted and you can find dinosaur bones
I wish in my heart that this gets seen by Jeffrey. As much as he has been the GOAT of YouTube, I still care. I still watch and I am for this journey of elevation for him. I can't wait to see how his growth evolves his brand. Even if I am just one person commenting to say " think of all the small things that got you here...sometimes humbled and enlightened is a really great place to be". I love this version of Jeffrey and I am so thankful for you Shane on his behalf. The growth and love he has shared with us through your videos speaks volumes. Thank you Shane for showing him peace. For showing him that trust is still a thing and he is worthy of so much more. I love a good "started from the bottom" story. You did amazing. Thank you ❤️
Jeffrey is so FAKE!!!
jeffree: as long as you don't use they and them you'll be fine!  oh my gosh, 🤣🤣🤣
So crazy to see Shane at my citys airport! I literally grew up with Denver International Airport! So glad you moved to Colorado and are living your best life!!!!!
Cute. Cute. Cute
youtube is not dead, you just became irrelevant✨
Ok true..most of the posts on instagram are  from tictok anyways.i don't have a tictok and have never seen any of jefrees post.havent even seen him or shane since part 1 😅😢
Do i watch Jeffree anymore? No. But his comment about no one watching YouTube? That’s not true, me and a lot of people I know use YouTube as one of our comfort things and I will re-watch the same videos from my favorite Youtubers all the time
I think people just don’t wTch beauty stuff anymore.
4:27 am, and im watching shane and jeffree
Really good friends never forget each other
My favessss
First of all, I so needed this <3 I feel so proud and happy for them. These 2 literally raised me on YouTube lol & Jeffree's music was actually one of the very first songs I had as my MySpace profile song lol, I used to envy him bc of his scene days when he'd post pictures throwing up fruitloops, UGH my heart. If you know, you know yall ♥ ♥
Jeffree just 😂so funny ❤
Country living is the most peaceful thing in the world. I use to live in a big city but had major depression now I’m so peaceful.
When your gut turns with Shane's but you don't know why yet...
I can’t believe I waited so long to watch this, cause I love all these guys, especially when they’re together
Hi Shane! I've been watching you since the beginning of your YouTube career, but anywho that "portal to H3ll" comment SENT MEEE. 😂😂❤
Jeffree Star is a vile bully and does not deserve to have a platform. Neither do you.
shane i live in wyoming and i can tell you the ghost activity here is INSANE. we have old witch huts on the mountains, all kinds of crazy ghost towns you name it. i think you should do a video of ghost hunting here.
So real because I haven’t opened YouTube in so long and I’m just seeing this 3 months later
rewatching rn, and i just now figured out why jeffrey looks so oddly different. HE HAS EYEBROWS
i almost cry at the final part, so sad but true :((
Wow Jeffree looks beautiful in 36:58 woow
but i literally watch youtube videos all day long nonstop🥲 and while i do my makeup. i cant swipe on tik tok while doing my makeup or my laundry 🥺
I would love to see king form content of the ranch. We love following along your journey. Whether it’s the beauty world or your ranch, I’m just happy you’re happy. You deserve it❤
I hate flying too Shane.😂
I still watch YouTube, I don't like tiktok
I watch YouTube all the time!! I'm not a fan of tik tok
I’m so happy for Jeffery. He’s so happy and he’s started over for himself.
im watching late because i was too excited and afraid to watch this and have it end so quickly but... this is crazy to me because im excited to watch youtube videos everyday and i do, and i still watch from youtubers i have always loved
I want a party at Jeffree Stars Mansion do you need a Dragon King there 😉
Petition for them to drop the 2.0 palette.
Wow Jeffrey looks the most  beautiful I’ve ever seen him….you can really see the change he made on his inside shining through to his outside ❤ as someone as watched him and Shane for sooooo long, it brings so many memories and emotions to watch this full circle moment ….so happy for you guys
YouTube sucks now because of the CRAZY amount of adds….half the time I change the vid upon the first add
I don’t even watch tik tok! I love YouTube 😭😭🙏🏼
Can't blame Jeffrey for thinking about ditching Youtube. Shane, you just have to visit him time to time and let us know how he is doing. So...
Great choices Jeffrey! Wonderful life style changes, the real world!!
As I’m eating beef jerky while watching this lol yee haw
Omg I have the perfect last video for Jeffree  Ok imagine this him on a chair in a black room  with lights on him in giant robe with a “is it jeffree star approved” sign behind him his legs crossed one arm on his lap the other hand holding the first liquid lipstick he ever made or the first product he ever reviewed on the channel and hold it like you’d hold a cigarette he’d take puff and simple say it’s been a rollercoaster bye bitches
Aww Jeffrey looks so sad in so many diff parts of this. His eyes look sad
✨Brokeback mountain vibes ✨
We need Jeffrey and Shane ghost hunting!
Haunted series with Jeffree please!!!!!!!
I feel like people would watch YouTube more if it went back to OG YouTube videos
Omg I am so emotional. I have followed Jeffree since I was 15, and I am now 32. It’s the end of an era. I’m so happy for him but so sad 😢
this made me cry, I have been having a very hard time ion life recently and seeing jefree and you  made my heart smile....thank you :)
I’m just now watching this but THIS VERSION OF JEFFREY IS EVERYTHINGGGG! The heart the soul the energy the peace and comfort. He is also living my DREAM. That is slow living homesteading right there
i love that chris also interacts and talks in this video
black lives matter
THE PHOTOS ON THE PIN BALL MACHINE ARE ICONIC LMAO
dude... the amount of money i'd spend to spend a month with this group together with the yaks and just... i  wyoming. it's amazing i want to do this so bad
"I like to travel.  Just  not with... Elton John. "
The most irresponsible gun handling I've ever seen.
I guess they are back. LOL.
I still need the Doomsday palette though. I know it'll never happen. But I fucking need it.
Paranormal series noooow!!
I love Jeffree always have… MySpace to 2023. ❤
I love this new Jeffery
I love when Shane calls his shoes Shape Ups. Lol
Okay but I’m living for farmer Starr 🤣❤️
I really like your videos, but please drop the " I'm nervous " act, you are not brand new . and you are not nervous either
"I like traveling, just not with...Elton John"

❤️
Thats soo not true, I always waiting for Jefree or Shane and other too publish u guys are the reason YouTube it lit so if u guys stop it’s over
since when was he uncanceled ew
I seriously never wanted to be apart of the Shane & Jeffrey CANCELLATION train 🚂 smh! Life is way to short to judge, hate & gossip! I stand for their friendship!
"I'm alive!"  "He got gayer!"   😂💀
Take the freaking talc out of everything so I can wear makeup again! Non talc finishing powder holds better.
Jeffrey is an alien trying to fit into a human world and he is now adapting
👏👏👏👏👏👏🌟
Can you like please leave YouTube againxx
I just moved to Casper all the way from Tupelo MS and it was the BEST THING for me I live with my two handsome boyfriends   (One year EDIT) they were pretty abusive so I moved to Champaign Illinois and it was honestly for the best
Jefree literally keeps inspiring
The old Jeffree wouldn't have taken Shane's suitcase ❤
I love jefree
not the ending making me sad.
I think TikTok is bothersome because of how short the videos are and how things can be taken out of context reaaally easily. Then, we have thousands and thousands of people coming in with their opinions that’s solely based on those short clips. It just becomes overwhelming way too quick. If you’ve ever scrolled the comment section of any TikTok videos, you’ll realize how extremely chaotic it is and it’s not worth it. But, it’s great for exposure and becoming famous really quickly.  This is in response to @ 47:55
this is so inspiring and I missed you both so much ❤
I'm from Casper and it was so cool to see all of where I grew up on YouTube! I know that my grandparents old house is not too far from Jeffrees ranch on Hat Six road! It felt like I got to visit home in this video❤️
I think its because were all older and moving on in our lives. this generation of watching YouTube and these creators are all now 30 and up. im just out here raising my kids now
Awww I grew up on YouTube 😢and just the last portion of this video has me in tears ❤
Can we talk bout how handsome jeffree is with eyebrows like he can get it tbh
I’m rewatching for the billionssss timessssss we need a haunted series with Jeffery like I wanna see u explore hunted shit again 😭😭😭
I just started watching you and jeffree 2 weeks ago, and now he's planning to quit 😭 I'm not ready for it.. I really loved your friendship and have been really loving to see you together 🥺
I have been mia on social media for quite sometime and returning to see this video made me cry. 😭❤️
Me when Jeffery said he’s stopping youtube *😳😩💔* I watch YouTube more than Tiktok
Good for him. It hard to remember the things that truly matter
I ❤ u Jeffrey
Dude I watch YouTube every single night people are just not watching Jeffrey’s content as much as before , there’s competition and he isn’t able to keep up
Such a missed opportunity to call it the "Starcade" LMFAO!
I've been so busy trying to pick up the pieces of my life that I really had to stop watching youtube. But after so lone, trying to keep pace on what was going on with you shane and jeffree too. I was really sad hearing that jeffree would be not doing vids here anymore.
i believe god told him he needs to be more grounded and he didn't need the luxury
Lmaooo “because of my cancellation his palette ended up at TJmax”😂😂😂😂😂
omg i love jeffree
That's a lie I watch YouTube for fun and I care tbh 💖
Things have changed. Yep
Didn’t you have sex with your cats?
It took me a while to get over Jeffree owning (and slaughtering) yaks, but honestly, his facility is more humane than conventional meat factories. He lets the yaks live and roam, they have good lives, and then they become food at the end. In other places the animals would be kept in cages not big enough to even move in, the animals would suffer their whole lives, and then be killed in violent, slow ways. I may think it's odd that Jeffree owns yaks, but he's at least giving them good lives.
love you guys
All I do is sit on YouTube 😢
I’m late, but I hope Jeffery never quits YouTube! With him recently, shutting down all tiktok make up creators who get paid to sell us (small consumers) crap. We need him more than ever!
I still watch youtube ...
The fact they let a super small minority of IDIOTS cancel them baffles me. Like no
I care about Youtube! I'm still here!
one purse is a nice house for a family.... god damn. I hope I can Get a house soon.. let me find something to sell lol
I love a new Shane and jeffree series
JEFFRREE IS DEFINETLY RIGHT ABOUT YOUTUBE DYING... COUPLES ARE BREAKING UP AND CHANNELS ARE GETTING DRY ASF... ITS TIME FOR A NEW PHASE IN LIFE. SHANE.. I THINK YOUR NEW LIFE IS WITH JEFFREE HE LITERALLY GIVES YOUR ENTIRE PERSONALITY AND PERSONA MEANING AND PURPOSE. IVE SAID IT BEFORE AND ILL SAY IT AGAIN.. NEVER UNDERSTOOD RYLANDS FUCKING PURPOSE HE DOESNT COMFORT YOU OR CARRY YOUR EXCITEMENT THE WAY JEFFRREE DOES.. YOU SUIT EACHOTHER WELL IN THAT OF FLAWLESSLY GETTING ALONG AND UNDERSTANDING EACHOTHER. YOU GUYS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THIS IN A WAY THAT I KINDA HAVENT SEEN IN A LONGG TIME.. ILL BE SO MAD AT YOU IF YOU LET JEFFREE SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.. AT LEAST CREATE THE FUCK OUT OF SOME CONTENT WITH HIM.. YOU WILL EVENTUALLY SEE... JEFFRREE IS YOUR TRUE PAIR. LIKE A CHUBBBY FINGERED HANG FITTING INTO THE MOST FIT GLOVE.
OMG SO FRUSTRATING THAT HE LITERALLY SAID THIS FEELS RIGHT CUZ ITS WITH YOU AND HE THINKS HES TALKING ABOUT RYLAND BUT HIS PERSONALITY SHINES WHEN HES WITH JEFFRRE
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SHANE SHOULD DUMP RYLAND AND GET ON THAT STAR BOOTAY.
SAME SHIRT EYE ROLLLL RYLAND IS REALLY POINTLESS AS FUCKKKK OMG SHANE GET RID OF HIM ALREADY
SHANE TH EBOMB IS THAT YOUR INLOVE WITH JEFFERY YOU LITERALLY SAID IT YOU ARE JUST SCARED BUT YOU SHOULDNT BE YOU GUYS FLAWLESSLY UNDERSTAND EACHOTHER. YOU WERE NERVOUS BECAUSE YOU LIKE HIKMMMMM
SHANE... I DONT NOW IF YOU NOTICED BUT THE BOMB IS THAT YOU ARE INLOVE WITH JEFFERY AND SPOILER ALERT HES INTO YOU
Put the shitty music a little louder I can almost hear what you guys are saying
“YouTube sucks” gets 3.3 million in this video 😅
I still watch YouTube videos that’s my thing
actually i think its good to move away from youtube, why does society put so much pressure on youtubers to constantly make new videos. there is so much good content to rewatch and discover. lets go rewatch old videos of our fav creators
but i love youtube omg im a youtube generation baby
Stop 13:45 is my favorite part so accurate and funny that’s really how besties are🤣🤣
What he made selling a purse, HALF of it would allow me to eat everyday, but teeth to chew solid food with and buy a home for my son. The pandemic murdered 30 years of my hardwork and he talks about money like it grows on trees. I'm a creative, I'm actually talented (though admittedly a little bitter), but Michigan didn't foster... Anything. I can't tell you how many of Jeffree's videos I begged him to hire me for anything if he likes my work, ALL ignored. Glad he's over being successful, when some of us will never get a chance even.    Commence with the hate towards me for being honest and defeated.
OMG OMG YES YES YEEEESSS U GUYS R BACKKK
I love how Jeffree went from showing off his expensive bags to showing off his cool truck😂
The stock video of Athens, GA as Wyoming
43:48  looks like a young Michael kelso ( Ashton Kutcher )
From pink walls to black 🥹🥲🥲🥲
I just am so happy for Jeffree and Shane ! This makes me happy to see them together 😊 Jeffeee truly has grown up and has created a beautiful life in Wyoming. I love how he said he got tired of buying things and being surrounded by materialistic things. Just shows money and things don’t make you happy Ao happy for Jeffree and Shane you are doing such a good job ! Your killing it everyday you wake up 🤍🙏🏻
Kinda wonder if him and Nate would still be together if Jeffree came to this realization before. Either way im so happy for him.
GRIND CONSPIRACY THEORIES AGAIN PLZ
Love this series x honestly I pay for so many streaming services and I watch YouTube way more than any of them! Don’t ever quit Shane!
I still watch you tube ❤️
Please don’t leave YouTube! I love you guys!
I love how Shane's voice doesn't annoy me or disturb me which is one out of the ten reasons I love the videos and will continue to watch.
You guys have got to bring YouTube back!!! Get Jenna back on too and break the internet
I’m so sorry, but I am addicted to YouTube. I’m constantly on it and I love YouTube and I look forward to seeing Jeffree star all the time and I’m a old bat hope he dont leave
Ok but can we appreciate the camera man's obsession with the dogs?
Youtube is not dead, it's just dead for you guys because of how problematic jefree is still to this day. He lives off of drama and doesn't deserve to be an influencer with his shady behavior. It's not a good role model and his make business is shady too. AND LETS NOT GET INTO HIS RACISM
I need Jeffee's motivation when I start my next thing.....like he needs to teach motivation classes
This was the most refreshing content I’ve seen on YouTube in years. 🙏🏽
I live for YouTube ! Short form content is good but I love for this !
I thought this Shane guy was canceled? He keeps popping up on my shh.
Everyone is leaving LA… who is left there???…
Wow I've missed these two bring together so much. It's been too long. Their friendship brings beautiful vibes xo
Dammn i would definitely be down to watch Shane and jeffrey a paranormal series.
I absolutely adore this new Jeffrey!! So down to earth but also still in business making dat mon-ay 😂i love the country beautiful
Jeff whipped that shit out like "fuck around and find out." 🤣🤣🤣 and is that a silencer?? I hope so.
Omg I miss this
LEFT ON A CLIFF HANGER 🤯
Jeffree is so hot now sucks he gay. So glad he finally happy. You can see it .
lmao someone tell my why jeffree’s gun has a silencer on it 🤭
Very casual ad of hummers lol
Youtube obviously hates me for not alerting me about this sooner!!   This made me so emotional 🥹 Tbh one of my only regret in life was not buying the conspiracy collection in its entirety,
Okay, love them, hate them... but they're really fucking funny 😂😂😂 individually and together
I'm about to start a bull farm 😂 I feel like I'm connecting with Jeffree on a spiritual level
Don’t ever quit Jeffree. I love you and I’m here for you!
Not the silencer 😂
As this starts, everyone else goes down the path of decadence, and Jeffry experiences enlightenment, comes out of it, becomes straight and marries Madison.
I love this duo
Jeffree looks great here - looks like he's super relaxed and his humour and wit shone through
I love Jefferee omg...
wow, jeffree star is such a fucking creep. Just casually sexually harasses his employee on camera.
We can tailgate that comments a little sus after his recent announcement of an NFL, boyfriend
I feel like Jeffery staying away from Shane is a good thing. Shane is toxic.
i love jeffrey! shroom bae 4ever!
The biggest reason creators & in turn, viewers are leaving YT is really cause it’s become so overly censored & monetisation is being taken more than it’s given + dropped substantially even for the monetised ones… & videos taken down left & right, can’t even say the M or B words in True Crime videos anymore!!!!   It takes SO long to make a video & a lot of money too so creators are sick of it & feel they are better off on platforms where they’re appreciated & not under such overwhelmingly strict “rules” that it sucks all the creativity out of creating… & wherever the creators go, obviously viewers follow…
These fricken tik tokers stole my YouTubers 😢
Entire pandemic I watched nothing but YouTube an old stuff from years ago
YouTube I hope it’s not dead,, it’s happiness to me when I’m sad,, it’s just always been there, and to have creators slowly fading out of YouTube breaks my heart,, like I don’t want them to not enjoy life by making videos it’s just that,, I’m gonna miss that
That was such a sad way to end the video,, YouTube brings me so much joy in my life, it’s actually insane and kind of concerning,, but I don’t know, all you guys have been such a comfort in my life and I’m not gonna lie, it’s sad to see people who bring me so much joy loose their joy by doing the videos that bring me so much joy, you know? I don’t know
I know it was such a small part in the video, but the part about TikTok and that video that someone ACTUALLY had the audacity to film and post is soo sad! I fucking hate the Internet sometimes💀 soo disappointing
I’m obsessed with Jeffree’s eyebrows!! 😊❤
Jeffree: Sees Yellowstone once
14m is so cheap for the square footage holy crap
Jeffery might be in the most controversial shit but he is so mf mature  love him
JS, is right YouTube is dead it's getting old and boring.
I love you Jeffree❤❤❤
I think they don’t realize that the teenage girls that grew up watching them, like myself, are just adults now and I personally am so busy I can’t sit down and watch a 20-30 minute video and I feel like that’s the case for a lot of fans
As someone who lives in Wyoming I’m obsessed with the respect Jeffrey has for our home. We like it quiet here. And we like that he likes it like that 🖤 he really is a pretty grounded and “normal” person. He’s made mistakes. Addressed them. And has shown growth. Like the rest of us. He just did it in the public eye. But he promotes gun safety, he is a business owner, well spoken, a good friend, good host (the suitcase move? Humble humble)
“no one watches it anymore” every video has over a million views 😧
Absolutely love this Jeffery, he’s a different person and I’m happy that he’s found a new person in himself. Congratulations 😊
Hello beautiful souls 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🫶🏽 I absolutely love your Yaks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hugs from Northeast Minneapolis 🫂
When did Shane get uncancelled
He is so smart and so thrilled he rebuilt his life to a healthy existence 💖 💗 💕 ❤️
we watch youtube!
" a good heart and soul" lol. I love him.
i think this whole series has been planed ..😌 but i don't mind,i think this was a good idea at this point :)
Shane don’t quit YouTube! Lmao I watch YouTube a lot I feel like
I always watch YT!!!
My fiancé asked if I was watching a show this is exactly why yt will never die I wish Jeff wouldnt quit but I understand
This is my favourite version of Jeffree 🤍🤍
My brother & I went to a tiny red carpet event that Jeffree was doing in Hollywood for a Liz Taylor night years ago. My brother had to pee really bad as I parked. Jeffree was dancing & everyone was watching & my brother crossed in front of him not knowing who Jeffree was at the time & just trying to get around him to get to the bathroom. Jeffree was PISSED he wouldn't dance with him & I think it was his birthday too. So, when I got to the bar to get a drink, my brother says, "Don't look now, but there are 12 Elizabeth Taylor Transvestites that want to kill us both right now! I looked up & saw the scariest glares from all of the Liz's across the bar & was dying laughing!
YT lost us all when thay started sensur out the truth about C0r0na.. it was the first platform for real life and thay destroyed the illusion we had that we got the right information from them.🫣
💖💖💖
OK if this new pallet is it called “Canceled,” I swear to everything holy 🤯
I'm on YouTube everyday....
AND YOU TWO BETTER MAKE A PARANORMAL VIDEO SERIES ❤️
Shane looks so cute in his farmer outfit 😍
I watched it ... :( I loved every video so much. Who will is watch now... Im devastated.
Noooooo don’t go away.
Everything happens for a reason, it just is, and I'm really glad, that JS woke up!
love you and jefree star!
It’s beautiful to see how much not only Jeffree has grown but you as well Shane. I’ve grown up with you guys, seen the good, bad and horrible. You guys have never looked so happy healthy and put together before.
I’m literally crying🥹 this is just so wholesome it just made me so happy!!! I LOVEEE THEMMM!! They both look so amazing 🥹😭🫶🏼🫶🏼
I still love watching Jeffrey!!! This makes my heart cry!!
I literally ONLY watch YT, just whole different content than prior. I used to watch what everyone was watching now it's all true crime, prison n lawtube. I don't even know why I pay for cable or streaming services at this point. I don't thing nobody watches YT anymore. They're just not as much beauty/family/influencer content being watched on the app.
The amount of money Jeffree has always seems to surpise me 😂😂😂
IDK HOW THE HELL IM LATE TO THIS!!!! I binged ALL 2019/2020 (whatever that time was….)& IM SO HAPPY THE DUO IS BACK! Y’all are effortless chemistry forrealllllllll.
I LOVE YOU GUYS ❤ MISSED YOU TWO TOGETHER SO MUCH 🍄🐚💫
I feel like after his breakup with Nate it woke up the part of Jeffrey to leave it all… so glad for him
I miss you Shane. Nice to see you again.
I don’t understand how anyone can live in those overpriced, overcrowded cities. Country living, fresh air, riding horses is honestly the best thing ever!
I use YouTube for sleeping videos.  It does suck.
I miss 2016-2018 when we can enjoy full length drama and jokes on youtube instead 2:30 menits tiktok video
I'd love to see a video that includes a sit down interview with Jeffree and mama Star. I've only seen 1 picture of them together and she's beautiful. I've been a fan of Jeffree since MySpace and it's so nice to see him in a good space in life. He smiles more and seems to be happy just being Jeffree Steinenger.
I miss Jeffree
Oh I hope he decides to go down the paranormal route at some point- aside from experiencing some intense stuff, connecting to the paranormal is also great for spiritual development and growth and it seems Jeffree is on a spiritual journey at this point in his life. Just be safe and educate yourself BEFORE diving into the world - demonic and negative spiritual attachments are no joke - LA’s negative energy don’t have shit on demonic energy - if you think getting cancelled 10x over is tough, that ain’t nothin compared to the chaos demonic attachments or possessions can cause.
Hahaha. The humbled part because Jeffree's old house was 20x bigger than the new one 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and yet still way bigger than anyone elses lol
I'm SO HAPPY you're back! I've missed your series like this a lot <3 5 minutes in on the first video and I was laughing already, your videos bring me so much joy! All that said I have a constructive criticism. The music in this videos is quite loud and it makes it hard to understand when people are talking, get's worst when everyone is talking. For many people, with hearing problems (don't know if that's the appropriate term in English, as is not my first language) or people whose English is not our first language it's kinda of distracting so if you could lower the volume of the music a little bit for future projects it would be wonderfull. Also before anyone talks about subtitles, the YouTube generated subtitles are not the best.
I didn’t see the video by Christy Carlson Romano, was it part of some other video?
Nooooo Shane, what's this new Jake Dolittle video about? :(( I love you but...?
But yes on a new topic it would be VERY EXCITING to see a paranormal series and to see you and Jeffree discover new places and undiscovered things would be AWESOME! Love you both and don’t EVER feel discouraged that anyone is watching. You STILL have RIDE OR DIES that watch you (in a good way 😝). Love ya and your fans are still here! 😘
Youtube might be dead for Jeffree but people are still using it. I still watch it daily. I think he spoke from a place that might still be angry over all that cancel nonsense that happened.
If Jenna marbles came back ppl would be on YouTube again
I think the cancellation of Shane and Jeffree was something that really affected the extinction of Youtube.
It's really crazy how Jeffree here says that he's quitting and yesterday he said that he will be doing makeup reviews again (which I would personally love)😄
Why am I concerned about that they showed Jeffries actual home streets
Shane was me with my hillbilly’s fiancé with the 🔫😂
Saying hi from Idaho Falls, ID! I love watching you guys, it cracks me up and puts me in such a better mood!
Land investment is a very smart move from Jeffrey. He gets it $
No one watch YouTube anymore?! No one care abt YouTube?! This video alone has 3M views! That's a lame excuse! No one watch You Jeffree! You suck cause you abused the trust in ppl!
kinda sad jeffree wont b doin the youtube revels. but times are changing
I am so so so happy for him.  I feel like I grew up watching his success (and yours).  I want to hang out with him on the ranch and just be free.
I understand completely what Jeffery means about YouTube, but please don’t stop doing hit or miss on makeup products! Keep doing them on tictok we need you!!! WE NEED THE HONESTY
It's amazing Jeffree just literally left everything he thought he loved clothes, bags, house for a more quiet and humble life out in the countryside. I really want to do this too, get away from the city and social media and live in the countryside with my little family and have a small holding. My dream.
Ooh come on JS, we still want to watch you on YT!!
y'all fr supporting shane after everything he's done?
If you haven't already you should make a "Mother Earth: pallet, using earth\ wind\ water\ fire colors
Idk how else to explain it but seeing Jeffery like this truly brings happiness and joy to my heart.
Being a fan since they both made music to YouTube videos, to see  the evolution of both Shane and Jeffree feels very full circle, I hope Jeffree comes back to YouTube to updated us every now and then ❤️
Its cute that he was nostalgic with the shoes. But jeffree literally walked up in the same outfit he wore when they were putting their pallets together
Today in another episode of: "why the entire world hates america" another shane dawson video
I love Jeffree 😭😭😭😢😢😢I’m gonna miss him sm on YouTube 😭😭😭😭😭
Noooooo!!! I watch YouTube now more than ever, more than Netflix Disney Paramount and all of the others and I have all of them!  And what is funny is I’ve been watching you! Haha don’t stop making videos.
Jeffree needs to continue on utube. Love uuuu. Great life on the ranch. No one around, just a dream. ❤️
When Jeffrey pulled that suppressed out glizzy I was flabbergasted.  Dear God that man is wild 😹😹😹
Gonna say it again!!! JEFREE IS OPEN TO THE GHOST ADVENTURES, SO YOU MUST DOA. SERIES THERE AND INCLUDE JEFREE POSSIBLY!!!
Youtube will always be my number on place to look at great content. I draw a lot as a profession, and having Youtube videos in the background while working is the best thing I know. Can't do that with TikTok, I don't wanna watch a 10 seconds clip, I want actual long videos with feelings. Creating videos like this is like creating a piece of art, it takes time, emotions, heart... I don't know about everyone else, but for me personally, Tiktok will never be as great as Youtube.
I still love YouTube.
It’s so weird remembering you’re a creator, I watched from the start but don’t spend much time on YouTube since college and having my own kids, so I keep forgetting to see if you still make content 😂 it’s wild
Go HUMMER!!! they said it couldn't be done.....i was the stigma b/c i didn't care what anyone said i loved the full sized first hummers and everyone frowned on me......I love Hummers they are sooo beautiful
I just took time off work and thought I'd catch up on whats new on YT...... absolutely nothing!!!  Even though a month or 2 later, I'm saddened to hear about JS leaving YT. But I totally understand why. Jeffrey, just like My Space faded because the coming out of FB, now alot viewers are climbing aboard TT. Eventually FB & YT will be a thing of the past. I'll be keeping up with you for sure! Enjoy beautiful Wyoming.
The gun 😭
I love Jeffrey and I hope he has found some inner happiness in getting rid of all the materialistic things.
Ghost tour palette??? Scorpio palette ?😮
idc i still love jeffree
26:20 Shoutout to Jeffree for waking up and realizing that the life he was living before was shallow and based on Looks & money .  I think it’s great how much more down to earth he’s become …
Ugh   The end of an era   I hate getting old
As a Native Wyomingite, I'm so happy and fuzzy feeling over this video. I am so proud of the *new* Jeffrey! He has done incredible things for Casper.
I love him more now
I want more Shane glossin.
I literally only come to YouTube to listen to Fleetwood Mac and see the latest Shane video, keep it up!!!
This was everything 😭
I've missed you Shane ❤️
The real fans still here
You can say what you want or think what you want about Jeffree, but him leaving his LA castle to become a farmer is honestly so refreshing. He went from $10k Gucci clothes with the tags on to wrangler jeans and shitkickers. And he’s doing so much with the brand by selling quality farm raised food, and eventually so many more products from the yaks. He’s been doing well for himself and for others, the first step was leaving toxic LA. I’m happy for him and can’t wait to see where the ranch takes his business next!
Jeffree is absolutely right...nobody absolutely nobody cares about youtube and it 100% sucks. A few years ago i could come home from school and watch videos for hours but now it take me hours to find one video that interests me. Youtube fixed something that wasnt broken, from the YT shorts and the "premium" YT or whatever is was called to the sensitivity of the videos and copyrights all went into the downfall of YT and not just the beauty community died, the gaming community also died, couple community died, and the vlog community is dying. the only thing left is Mr.Beast type content, such as giving away and challenges
I’m confused why was jeffree dropped by morphe 😭 & im commenting while watching this don’t come at me !
I miss Jeffrey on YouTube !!!
Meanwhile I'm here wondering why nobody is posting anything. I'm not downloading Twitter or Instagram or the clock app. 😒
Some of us still love and care about YouTube ❤️
Proud of Jeffrey
This made me so happy. I'm from Cheyenne, WY about 2.5 hrs from Casper. Seeing all the scenery definitely made me miss home. This was great, I missed you guys all being together!
20:49 had me crying😭
Jeffree's skin is amazing here!
I love❤this reunion video. You guys have such a genuine energy. And Jeffry you look fantastic! I wish you both the best the future has to Offer.
Hii❤️ i still watch jeffrey, i enjoy youtube. I don't like tv shows, it's too fake.. so i watched my favorite youtubers and stuff about their life and that they sre willing to share.  But i understand, tiktok it is right now. The newer generatons don't appriciate longer videos, it needs to be quick and easy these days. That's ok, time changes everything and all of us❤️  But still, it's sad to hear, i hope it isn't true.  And i hope you guys don't quit😩 Much love❤️
I'm glad you're back buddy.
Honestly I could care less about the drama I love you and Jeffrey! He still makes the most killer make up!
Release the pallet and call is “the cancelled pallet”
Just know when it’s comes to you guys, I’m ALWAYS clicking that button and watching. I’ve been here for YEARSSSS
I’m leaving u tube Shane , u wan a quick buck ? One u can stretch out ? Love jeff
Oh Shane Dawson…. I cam’t stand you but can not stop watching! I wish you well but serioulsy everyone deserves to be forgiven but i just dont trust you 😢
The first thing I thought when I saw the gun was “ MERICA” 😂
Jeffery you really are amazing and I love watching you with Shane again. My niece absolutely loves you makeup and if you would like to send her some she would love it so much. Thank you Jeffery.
Jeffery I wanna come hang with you for a couple years. Live on the ranch help you take care of all your amazing animals. God I would love to be there with you.
Jeffree looks so gorgeous
Lol scorpios like to go fast it's so funny Jeffree showed you that
Jeffrey: there's no one here 😂😂😂😂 I FELT that haha
lol we've gone green now haha
Jefree is so adorable Omg
when jeffrey pulls put the gun with the silencer 💀😂
this is by far the best version of Jeffree Star
I'm just saying....watching the people watch you guys is hilarious....Jeffree is right🤣 no gay culture here...and the silencer?!? Omg 🤣 whhhhy
My dream is to smoke the best weed with Jeffery star and talk about all the conspiracy’s of the world
Okay but is Maddy still with Jeffree?? I saw she posted w him on her insta the other day Am confused
Jeffree is so down to earth, always has been. I love him and Shane!!
Just stay away from cats, Shane.... we all know you want to spread their legs.
I’m so proud of you Jeffree and the growth!
im crying i didnt know jeffree was done with youtube 💔
DISGUSTING...
Glad to see him doing extremely well
All these flashbacks from their palette launch makes me so sad. It shows how life used to be so happy and people were so much more kinder and not so ready to slit your throat.
You fucking Froot Loops all of you
I could listen to Jeffree speak for hours and hours, they are so fascinating 🙌🏻
That pallette is incredible....wow... Thats gorgeous!
52:55 so then i started bawling..... :(((
I love seeing these 2 back together. They're so fun. Amazing friendship
Where is Ethan’s comment wtf
Camera man needs a stabilizer
OK I’m watching so I guess I’m chopped liver because I don’t think I’m gonna stop watching YouTube
SO HAPPY YOU ARE SERVING US CONTENT AGAIN SHANE!!!! :)
Why am I crying for Jeffrey Star?
This is my reality tv, only think I follow religiously
Please for the love of god, do a ghost adventure
Although many people have been more on tik tok, if you make the content, people will come watch! I love YouTube, it's where I watch my favorites, always have(:    Love you Shane🖤 glad you're back
I here for the pro-gun culture. Go Jeffree!
I will say, I am not an OG JS fan but (!)Jeffree Star came into my life when I was going through a difficult break up in 2015. I was 24. Never played with make-up. I wasnt too much on computers or smart phones. I found JS on YouTube for makeup tutorials and I found such a peace and cathartic growth playing with something as simple as makeup. Because Jeffree unknowingly helped me through this dark time in my life, I have always wanted him to do well! I saw him at the Morphe store in Washington Square Oregon Mall opening. I feel like he has grown so much. I have too. At 32 yrs old now, I love, absolutely love how this is the chapter people need to experience in their life. To be humble. To rest. To reflect. I am still so happy for Jeffree. I feel like he is moving on to the next step of life. No longer showing off his success, which he certainly is. But now to shift towards significance. Who is Jeffree, who he has to share it with, not what he has now but what he leaves behind. I know this may come off so cheesy but I mean it with all sincerity. I love Jeffree and I am so excited for the future for Jeffree and JSC!
imagine what shane knows just bc is friend with jeffree
Youtube isnt dead, te toxic beauty community and drama filled channels are dead.. I use youtube just as much and honestly its so much better now.
Fucking missed Jeffree in his natural habitat! I do love how he is enjoying his life in the normal part of US! And he looks super handsome! And it is so nostalgic to look back at Conspiracy! Damn!
The traveling with Elton John comment by Shane killed me so hard ❤😂
Hes right the beauty industry is dead on Youtube especially but I dont think that means all of youtube is dead
GIRL WHAT THE FUCK ITS BEEN A MONTH
Im so sad 😭😭
me looking for ethans comment rn 😭
It's understandable that Hollywood sells californacation.
What is going on.
Yes Jeffrey is beautiful when all glammed up, but short hair no makeup he is very handsome
Love that Jeffree got away from the evil of Hollywood and can live to tell about it I knew it back in 2020 when he chose to leave that life that he was at a crossroads and the choices he made speaks volumes about his true morals he was portrayed as a villain when in all reality he is a good person
Jeffrey…we are all growing up where we just don’t want social media anymore and we are all like soooooo. We all get to the yak stage eventually
Shane, your audio is all over the place; the music is too loud, I can hear the hissing from the low-qual camera mic you're using, and why can I hear the scraping of your camera lens during every zoom? How do you not have this figured out yet
jeffree said nobody watches YT nomore when this vid got 3mil views with more than 100k likes lol
SHANE D!! You are naturally hilarious so put together a stand up routine?!?! Paused at 11:00 to write this.
So fake. Entertaining but fake
Time stamps please
shane gawping in silence then repeating everything jeffree says yawn
I still care 🥺❤ I know that may not mean alot but i still watch
Stop I literally missed this so much
It actually makes me so sad how Jeffree feels. He’s so hurt. I love these videos so much ❤
I love Wyoming Jeffree. While they weren't ready for this, I was!
the magazine reading clip 💀
Even if ur cancelled at least post conspiracy theories
The nervous “maybe you should take it back” is me with my moms guns just existing😬
Shane wearing his hat backwards 🤦🏼‍♀️ guuuurl get it together 😂
I love seeing Jeffree so happy, that makes me happy, but I'm really sad that he's quitting YouTube,  I'll really miss him. I know he won't read this comment, but I just wanted to say that even though I don't know him, he's been a really important part of my life, I love his videos, so, Am I sad that he's leaving YouTube? Yes, I really am, but on the other side, I'm really happy for him, with his new and healthier life. Congrats babe! Greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽 ❤️
i don't see anyone not caring, you got 3 mill just by collaborating i think  that counts as people caring.
I doesn't like this "Shane  Dawson" from the first Minute : He seems disgusting to me,  bääh, this is only a feeling inside of me, but in most of Time I'm absolutely fine and real true with my feelings!  Jeffree I 'didn't like in the Years before...okay...a bit I liked him,  to be true and honest, because He was honest, too !  He was an Asshole  - and He showed it clearly. 😉 Everybody can have his own Meaning and Opinion!  But Shane D. is only a disgusting, unpleasant looking and "changing Mind" Person I can't trust for 1 Minute!   To Jeffree : if He can find his inner Line,  his Feels, his healthy true Mind = 👍💖👏👏👏 Mother Nature in Wyoming maybe will clear up his Mind ...and SOUL  !  A wonderful Place for Healing❣👍💖😍🤗 I hope to the very Best, that He will learned something the importants Thing for him !  Stay creative - and fuck off to People which are not healthy for you, Jeffrey!   Find yourself  - and you will find the true important Life  ❣💖👍😍🤗
Love jeffree forever
Tôi rất thích video này
Awe nooo Jeffree 🥺
I still watch you tube non stop. Love this documentary ❤
Oh
Skipped through most
I love how much Jefree star has grown 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻😭😭😭🖤🖤🖤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love ALL OF THIS! So much love ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I think Jeffrey is a good looking guy I’ve never seen him look so good.
This was like a breath of fresh air. I didn’t realize how much I missed you guys. It’s good to see that you’re both doing well.
uh didn’t they spend like a whole two years trash talking each other lol
“YouTube is like myspace” that hit hard. Cause its true. But crazy to think where it started.
Off topic but I STILL use my conspiracy palette at least 1 a week 😅 I LOVE IT
who the hell in sane enough to watch this shit
Tôi thích thương hiệu này
Tôi  thích thương hiệu và đánh giá này
I would love to see a paranormal series with Jeffree and Shane!!
Oh my god! Shawn is so quirky and fun and funny!!! I don't know how he does it! Sooooo unique and quirky. (sarcasm)
It's the dog hairs on his clothes for me, either he never changes or that house is filf
Okay so Shane had a little “hint” about making a docu series on someone last episode. He said it would be iconic and we’d all be shook and it would be insane. Then he showed a bomb exploding behind a woman. Now this video ended, then popped back up with Jeffree mentioning Jenna Marbles. Just thrown in after the fact. If i’m right Shane, you better do everything you can to make that happen!
We didn't script this..... totally random..... have no idea what to expect 😱 This is just a makeup ad, ultimately 🤡
I feel that about YT. Went from making 1-2K a month to literally 30-40...
I'm so glad I clicked on this video. It's true YT is dying I usually come here to watch an interview or find a song. I've always loved shane and he made me love Jeffery! I love them together it's such a good watch. How bout we'll stay if you guys stay. Ok? 😁💕
https://youtu.be/wqHGU2K-wik
Love the reference to Billie Eilish 👌😄
Wait Jeffrey’s old teeth tho….
I just started watching YouTube again due to being in a deep addiction but I'm clean and back!! Nothing will beat YouTube feck tiktok
I heard it here first Jeffree is done with YT. He's been a pioneer on socials so I guess it's time. Thanks for this update!
Hearing YouTube sucks really struck a cord and almost made me cry. It made me feel like I aged 100 years in one second. What an era, I never thought this era would die. I guess I'm one of the few who still uses YouTube as their main source of entertainment. I love the youtubers I follow, I fan girl them, I give them likes and shares because I feel like it supports them. Jeffrey is incredibly smart and well connected, I know only good things will come his way with whatever he embarks on next! Good luck Jeffrey!
32:59 Yeah and when the depression stopped the pomeranians stopped.   Iconic
Hell yess good for u jeffrey!!!!
Shane I fucking love u  Thank.u for coming back !!! Missed ur videos way too much !
Ryland looks soo good I love the fit amd glasses!!! "We're going to see Jeffery I have to make a little buy of a statement!"
How tf was this posted a months ago and I didn't know.  Tf
Why are we still supporting these crappy people
22:49 😂
“As long as you don’t use they and them you’ll be fine” 😂
The magazines 😂
“You just casually wear Gucci when you workout?” 😂
😂 loving this
I guess I’m old so maybe it’s like the boomer generation discovering Facebook and now that we here (I’m an early millennial at 42) the young kids want nothing to do with us, because YouTube has been my got to for 2-3 plus years!! You’re still being watched! Just maybe not by the new Gens?? Am I wrong?
God I can’t stand rylan… go away.
I could have sworn I saw Shane in Casper!
I didn’t realize but I really missed you guys. This vlog made me so happy ❤
OMGosh!!! I have to admit it. I think Jeffree is the prettiest man ever.
52:50 really broke my heart ♥
Was that a p90
this was so good
This makes me cry. I love seeing Jeffrey so happy. 🎉❤
well that said a whole lotta nothing... video 55mins and not one interesting thing happened.
I love that the g-n had a silencer on it like 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I cannot believe someone actually made a tik tok like that about you Shane I would have been swinging
I mean 1 million in LA is humble so it is humble for him even if he moved to Montana or whatever
I looooooveeee Jeffery !!!! 💛💛💛
Jeffrey is completely right YouTube is dead! Beauty is dead! Everyone wants and is striving for a more natural living natural looks, real life. Only reason why I am here is because I saw Shane and I loved all the series with Jeffrey in them it was the most realistic thing to watch on here. Glad to see them back.
Shane i watched this whole video.. just so you know.
Shane. Please follow Jeffree’s lead and  retire from YouTube. Get into a different career. Spare us these horrible videos. Please just do us all a favor and move on.  Become a Instacart delivery driver. Find a hobby. Just not making new videos.  Thank you. God speed. 💯
Everybody -didnt they have a massive blowout fight last time they were together and the world exploded and the internet broke.  Reunion: Hey Girl!!! Its been too long...
Shane 's team thinking of ideas for videos...   Shane: wait I got it... life!
I still love watching Youtube 🥰
I frikkin still watch you tube... I can't deal with you gone where are we gonna be able to see you.  How is that possible that you're leaving.   Yup this SUCKS
I love watching all you guys together.  We all need us some starr & shane to be happy.  This makes me happier then watching js with all his material shit. That's when you were so empty jeffree. Some of us know what's up with people before themselves do.  Glad to hear you say it.  That's Peace, finally. ♡♡♡♡
I love you all together.  Stay friends always  you guys.💜💜💜💜   Ry, you look awesome.
So he is getting off of YT.  This sucks
Madi and many more need to stay gone, smell, i mean talk about phoney asf ppl around Jeffree. Legit he is smart and hard working and deserves what he has, he came from cockroaches/ motels sharing a sandwich with him, to laying in diamonds that smell of sweet bitter lust. No one needs to be around his property or sucking on a tit from a far. I honestly feel he has NO real friends they use him out of jelousy and what can i get out of him!      1 day i pray he's happy.
I missed y'all SOOOO MUCH please don't ever quit we are here for you still ❤
I still use my conspiracy palette, always keep in mind that there's always people that don't give a frick if you're "canceled" lol
Shane I don't know if you will see this but I never cared or really understood the cancel thing. I will always watch your videos.
Shane your in Colorado 😅 LOVE DIA
I love this
I found Shane change now you don't have that something what but it will be coming out again we are still loving and waiting you as same before bro🫰💕
I missed you guys so much you know finally I want more videos like you two
Love how Jeffree just walked in the airport doors like a model on a runway.
Back so much better after my traumatic accident. Precedes to floor it in new car😂❤️ honestly I’m so happy they are back together lol
I missed this..
36:00
Hear me out. This is the most attractive Jeffree has EVER looked. Like, that energy is so freaking good. Also, this video editing and the way it was shot is one of my favorites. I’m really proud of y’all. Shane and Ryland are one of my favorite couples on YouTube, and honestly Jeffree is back on my radar because of this absolute gem of a video. 🖤🖤🖤
Jeffree looks so fucking good
I'm so happy for jeffree
This is my favorite Jeffrey :) he feels more authentic.
HAHAHA the gun w the silencer xD
I appreciate seeing this side of all of you so much more.
When Jeffree is naming all his pallets after the conspiracy. 😂 Bro keeps BUSY.
Seeing Jeffree walk into the airport. 🥹🥹🥹🥹
we’ve already lost jenna no one else leave please!!!
I still watch and use youtube wayyy more than any other app. Of everyone stopped doing youtube I would have less joy in my life 😂 53:41
The way Shane about sh!$ himself when Jeffree pulls out a pistol had me rollin. Most of us in WY carry 😂 it’s just normal. I’m glad to see Jeffree doing great things for Casper. I’m about 2 hours away but I hope to meet him one day💜
Yay!! I'm so happy you're back!
Im 20 min in. Late af to this series. But im dying lmao at this editing 20:45
If it makes Jeffrey happy to quit YT that’s okay but his makeup reviews are my comfort videos💔🤍
Tbh I'm not interested in JS
Jeffree isn't wrong.  YT sucks.  The constant censoring, stupid ass algorithm, the general bs, etc.  Most of my once favorite channels are dead or completely deleted...or still doing the same thing after 10 yrs and I find myself not watching anymore.  I come here for mainly music (like I did back when I first started coming to YT 10-15 yrs ago) and independent journalist news since all the mainstream stuff is trash.  That's pretty much it.  That said, I'll NEVER go over to TikTok.  I've seen enough second hand crap that I know I want no part of that cancer.  I am really happy for Jeffree, though.  I'm glad he finally found some real peace, not the fake kind behind a bunch of expensive purses and a bunch of other meaningless crap.  I've never met him, probably never will, but I do wish him the best.  I'll always respect the fact that he is self-made and deserves everything that he has because he worked hard for it.
Im so sad he's saying he's leaving youtube when I still watch like i still enjoy it so much
As a farm girl, I am so happy to see Jeffree doing it right. Never name what you eat. It's absolutely impossible to cull anything you have named. However, farming is absolutely amazing work. Hard as shit. Animals could care less if it is freezing, smoldering, or the day. They want to eat, and be cared for. Living where there is no population is epic. Harder if you are a "commoner" but, absolutely wonderful.  I would like to also add.. The gun should point at the floor. Always. Never point at anything you don't intend to kill. That is just a well known rule of thumb. Accidents happen, so try to prevent it. Love to all.
I hope Jeffrey giving up YouTube doesn’t convince Shane to. I’ve been watching him since fkn middle school. I’m in college now 🥺
I love the music Shane picks out. I swear his a film maker for YouTube.
Not me wondering how much living costs are in Wyoming….
Jeffree having a loaded gun and passing it to Shane! 😮😂😂 Be careful y’all. Don’t want nothing bad to happen on camera! 😢
Wow I missed all of you guys! It took sometime and hopefully we all learn from past mistakes. Glad y’all finally collaborated again!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone! 2023 💗🙏🏽🎉🎉
Anyone else hate the camera man?
This was so freaking fun!!
First couple seconds where Jeffery came on camera and they were loading the truck he was literally talking like a gay southern dad and it was beautiful
No wayyy this isn't true Jeffrey doesn't care he just a stupid gayay
Anybody else notice the Missouri temp tags? 20:34
Jeffree was right… no one cares… took months to watch this, I would have been counting down the minutes refreshing every half second for every shane doc series episode to come out, just put it on cause nothing else to watch… sorry still love you
YouTube is not going to die (anytime soon, at least). The only way the platform will die is if it stops being profitable and a new platform becomes more popular. Odds are, this won't happen, as YouTube has the best infrastructure for user-generated video content. The beauty community is dead period
Omg jefffffffreee pls don't quit YouTube. I've watched every video and looove them. I've followed you since I was literally 10 from MySpace days 🥺
Jeffree and Shane, Im sure you won't see this but I've been a fan for so long and I know sometimes you help people. I'm a single mom of two kids and I just lost my job Friday I'm freaking out thinking I'm going to lose everything I've worked for. I've been working hand to mouth my whole existence and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do. Please please help. I pray you see this.
It's amazing to see how much Jeffree has grown since the accident. You can tell that NDE really opened his eyes to what matters, and it's no longer the material life ♡  On a different note, I was gagging at #Shane's face throughout the entire Wyoming trip so far 🤣  And I want to argue one thing Jeffree said...uh hmm...I watch YouTube everyday  😉 #Wrong!
yo I am so proud of Jeffree. Like it must've taken a LOT to sell his purses and bags and clothing, like he LOVED them. I am very proud of him!
I have A LOT of mixed feelings on this installment.   But what you said at the end of the video, Jeffree.... I completely and utterly agree with you....
I’m happy for Jeffree. Life like that has to be soooo fun.
Jeffree is so cute w/ Eyebrows ❤️
I need star wedding collection to wear on my wedding day June 10, 2023
What do you mean no one watches or cares ???both Shane and Jeffery have millions of view on every video new and old, the people are here for it!!!
If Jeffree talked like that... and didn't do only makeup... i would be in his channel more :) #choices
Haha I loooove your personality Shane!!!  I’m a new subscriber, I always heard about you but never actually tuned in!!  I’m curious what is your sun moon and rising signs?! ❤
I clicked. 🤷🏻‍♀️
How does Jeffree enjoy the windy season?
Shane got fat Ong
yea i don’t even have tictok or any streaming BESIDES youtube. i love the long content of my favorite people… don’t ever stop Shane !
shane we did not forget
I don't blame Jeffree for feeling that way about You Tube. I think the essence of what You Tube used to be has been sucked out. I don't think it's big channels like Jeffree feeling like this. I think small channels and new channels would get the brunt of this unless they really stand out (from what I observe...I can think of two ASMR and one history related channel gaining a lot of traction despite being on You Tube not long). I'm a small channel and been on here for four years. You Tube has made it hard to get monetized and when I started, in order to get monetized...you needed a thousand subscribers and four thousand watch hours within twelve months. Problem? Most people that watch You Tube aren't the type of people who can subscribe to channels. Even a lot of bigger channels notice that the majority of the viewers are non-subscribers. Most of my views (as I have at least three vids that have over a thousand viewes) are non-subscribers. However, you can't get people to come to your channel if you're small because the algorithem picks up vids with a lot of views and likes because they are usually from bigger channels or channels owned by companies/celebrities. Even if you let people know about your vids off of You Tube...it doesn't get a lot of views. And the thing that is annoying now is that You Tube started putting ads on vids of smaller channels (like mine)...but yet you don't get one damn dime even if your vid. So, my excitement with having a channel has dwindled in the last two years. Not that I aim to be monetize, but when you don't get the views...it takes out the excitement you have of creating videos. Hence, I decided to go back to college at forty and get a degree associated with disaster preparedness as that's the field I want to work in. And hopefully doing that, make vids based on that (I've done some already for the fun of it)
I will forever LOVE the dynamic of Shane & Jeffree!! They feed off one another & it's everything! Love how grown they both have become!!
WE MISSED YOU SHANE 😢😂💗
53:10 he is so right, they went to Walmart and got 30 million views that’s amazing
I seriously love jefree Star so humble and hard working! <3
Pretty sure I heard you say the greatest Texas accent!
I want the pallet🥲 with all my heart! Lol
Shane has always and still looks like he smells. He’s so greasy too. His weiner must be salty af 😂 Yeah I still love him lol.
I think he should just call the arcade the "Starcade".  Seems obvious...maybe he does and I just missed it.
Dude I was just in Wyoming back in September for a camping trip. I have been so much I need to update on! I'm so glad I clicked this, feels like old times.
Jeffree taking Shane’s suitcase 🥹🫶🏻
I just think that the quality of Shane's content has decreased .  The  video editing was poor.  I don't mind the cuts between past and present but it feels  all over the place and don't get me started with the camera guy laughing every 5 seconds. The whole Jeffery segment wasn't very interesting, so what if he chooses to leave YouTube, he doesn't ever take accountability for anything, he acts like a victim, when he started all the drama.    He mostly just posts when he has something to promote anyway.  Shane didn't have to make a whole series if he just wanted to show the unreleased pallet, a 5 minute video would have sufficed....this was a waste of time and effort.
Life moves on. What I'm most surprised is the roads are perfect for practicing racing. The Star Ranch looks like the perfect place to recharge and to calm the spirit and mind. If everything fails you can just race in the streets.  The creature that has the power to command stones in the movie Labyrinth looks like a yak. Jeffree looks like a cute kid in his youth. I though all the pinball machines are for Nathan before. If I have a pinball machine I could only have one but it would be the best in my opinion because I would be at a lost which to play. I do have a virtual pinball before in my computer.
Shane, when you and Jeffree film together it feels like magic. Sad to hear Jeffree is quitting YouTube, but I have been noticing the content is lacking, at least for me. Maybe it's the algorithm or maybe I'm missing something, but it is definitely not peak YouTube vibes anymore. I hope that changes one of these days as it used to be my go-to place to chill and escape the world.
The hammer was back on that gun. Which scares me as they don't seem like either knew much about guns. Gun safety.
Youtube definetly still has its place but its nothing like it used to be. I come on here for specific creators often geared towards either: health, stand-up comedy, interviews with my favourite actors etc. but never like i used to where i would scroll and find endless videos i didnt even know i wanted watch like make-up reviews etc. i never have or will wear make up but i watched them for some reason but thats faded off now because like other comments have stated, this world is so full of drama and stress, the last thing we want or need is more of it. Im so happy for jeffree, he looks good and seems from a viewers pov mentally strong and i love someone that can crack jokes at themselves so fucking good on him. well done!
2.9 m views is not no1 is clicking anymore?!
Hearing “ YouTube is dead” really hit me because these people I grew up with watching growing into amazing people and I mainly watch YouTube over any other app or platform ever .. so please you & him don’t quit YouTube we’ve watched yall from the good , heartbreak, the bad and the ugly but the growth of everyone I watch is insane
Sam and Colby rip off
Im apart of the 1% that still clicks on youtube. I dont even have tiktok. I went from watching shane and Jeffrey to watch tarot readings because theres no more content but i come on and check every fortnight to see if theres anything new and tell me why i was unsubed?????
okay I watch YouTube 😅😅😅
lol I just came for the drama
Also Jeffree is SO HANDSOME!!!
This was so wholesome to see Jeffree & Shane back together. Love you guys <3
The Wyoming stats of 9th largest state with less people in it than some counties kind if makes is super attractive.  God I would love to not have people.  The yaks look happy.  I have no issue with meat but I prefer nose to tail and prefer the animals not be tortured while alive.
I’m an Independent Latino. I love you Jeffree.  That is great you are healing yourself of mental health. Just don’t stay out to long, reality you are in your 40s. 53:33 What are you saying Jeffree???  You have been out in the “No where country“ for too long…..YouTube is still and always be LIT - especially SHORTS.
Does the camera man ever shut up? The forced laughs RUINED this whole series
Shane whats the video of you dressed as your home ec teacher and u say" this chocolate cake taste like shi* please lmk i cant find it
despite the cancellation, both jefree and shane raised me and my generation. i hope they grow successful again.
Watching Jeffree all these years really makes me feel like he’s a close friend. He’s hilarious but even more so when he becomes more silly with Shane
Disgusting that Jeffrey eats his pets
NOOOO! Don't quit YouTube Mr. Star I need my 20 min long makeup reviews and new makeup updates😭😭😭 Although keep living the life❤
HEYYY STOPPP WITH THE DRAMATIC ANNOYING TRAILER MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND. I CANT HEAR SHIT
Don't quit YouTube Jeffree 🥺
Can someone tell me why they need guns if they are less populated? 😕
Honestly the whole “quitting YouTube” bomb drop wasn’t that too dramatic. Kinda understandable. But I think it’s the beauty influencers audience that disappeared. I went from watching no YouTube to only YouTube in the past few years. But I’m not interested in drama. Reality is loaded enough with drama. I go to YouTube to watch distraction stuff like funny videos or video game play of people just screwing around. The last thing I need is one more thing demanding fuel from my stress level gas tank. It’s dry. Everyone stop being so dramatic about everything all the time. We all need a break 😂
Woulda been better if so much of it wasn’t advertisements. That’s why we hate YouTube now. TikTok creators are authentic.
I ride yaks, lmao I almost spit my drink everywhere. I get it though. It's an awesome part of growing up, not caring so much about what others think about you, they are going to think it regardless. Try to be happy with yourself,it's all you really have, treat yourself right
I'm sorry but Jeffree leaving YouTube is literal marking an end of an era. Makes me sad
i would kill to be able to hangout with them i would be weak for hours
I still wish Jeffree gave honest reviews on all new products. He saved people so much money and made brands work harder for better products.
I hate tic toc please don’t leave you tube jeffree
Here to say I'm exhausted by your bootleg Alex Jones schtick. STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION. Please. Humanity has suffered enough, and there are ethical means to make money that you could consider trying instead.
this is flopping lol
I love youtube so excuse me.
jeffrey is the definition of “ i want it , i got it “
Okay but Jeffree letting Shane hold the gun was iconic 😂😂😂😂little miss Colorado girl🤠😂 I love them so much 💕
Jeffrey is actually very handsome guy . Just never seen him without all the makeup and hair
y is no one talking about the unreleased palette? I want oneeeeee 😭
I’ll ALWAYS click on a Shane Dawson video js
Where r da hate comments ????
The gun! 😅
I have 2 social media platforms. Snapchat and YouTube!!!!! That’s it. OG YouTube fan. Don’t quit Jeffrey :(
I LOVE THIS FRIENDSHIP 😭🤍
no one watches youtube anymore bc all the good youtubers got cancelled so they stopped posting.
shane and jeffree are my literal favorite duo
I was ready to move to Wyoming until he started talking about all the paranormal activity there.
Me: 23 years old and still watches YouTube videos  😬 am I really that old?
youtuube died when jenna left, but i came back for Jeffery n Shane
this made me happy beyond belief, i love Shane n Jeffery. we all have said n done things we wouldn't be proud of only difference is were not famous n put on blast for it. at their core there not bad people. they didn't do anything worth being cancelled for honestly.
“Time to Jenna Marbles and do something else.” 🥺🥺
Yes Jeffrey really did it all
This documentary just cemented my belief that everyone should be given the chance to change and improve for the better. Seeing Shane and Jeffree genuinely find some peace and happiness, though not without its struggles, after being canceled by the whole internet makes me so happy. I'm happy for you guys.
what’s the name of the music 51:45 pls i need to know
It depressing to me...I watch every vid...what ever u put out...I watch...is it not worth it for the few of us who still watch...and don't use tik tok? I don't have a tik tok account...I find it stupid..I have been with u since MySpace! And I'm still with u! Even though I don't like tik tok...I will follow u anywhere! It's called being loyal!
Loved seeing your little reunion together! Wish we would have gotten a little more reasoning on his big move, but so nice seeing him thrive in his new element! Shane, please do more conspiracy videos & talk more heavily about conspiracies on your podcast! ♡ Much love. Xx
I fricking love when shane and jeffrey make these series together!!!! Best content on youtube
Love this!
jeffree should make a clean makeup line it goes with his new vibe
Why is this actually so funny but heartwarming 😂🥰 it’s giving kardashian/office vibes lmaoo
Can one of you adopt me ❤❤❤
I like YouTube still lol
Im on the bit where JS says about the 30m views and he's right.  I loved your first series and i love this.  I'll keep watching ❤
This made me so happy to watch. I didn’t realize how much I have missed this ❤
Ryland keeps getting more and more handsome... like, how does he do it?!
💜💜
Over a million views isn’t nothing jeffree! Those are a million people that care! That should be enough. And for most people the less content they put out the less views they get. Start actually making videos reviewing stuff like you used to and I bet it will go up. Every since I first found you like 2 years into your brand (I never even really new about high end makeup till then, at 21 years old). And I really enjoy watching your videos
I love this new life for Jeffree!!!! So happy he found his new home and new life
Love you Jeffery, and your adventures ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Rudeeee. I wait and wait for him to post and I looooove watching them  Might even do a binge watch on all his products
I am 100% here for the 2023 release of the "Sooo..?" Palette ⚘️♥️🌠~♡☆
I still watch YouTube daily if I’m being real but it’s definitely not what it used to be! Loved this video and can’t wait for more
DONT DO IT JEFFREE!!
Yeah fair… I usually only ever open YouTube nowadays is for Sam and colby
All I have to say is how proud I am of Jeffree!!!❤
Aww man Jeffree I watch YouTube when I’m depressed and it brings me joy
Man one donation of a bag from Jeffree could get me out of debt😢😮
Jeffree is a genius and he looks so incredible!! I have always been a fan but I love this new Jeffree...he looks happy and light no heavy burdens to carry! Wishing him all the best always .
Absolutly love seeing Jeffree like this, there is something very satisfying of watching someone find peace in their life. Im am here for it 💖
It's nice he downsized. I can't imagine being alone if that huge house with no family or relationship. He doesn't need something that big.
Not all YouTube channels are a waist of time. But it's also ok to no when you're done too, it just means you're moving on to different things, and there is nothing wrong with that.
I love the gun/yak jeffree
how 85% of the video was in the car lol
Okay JS is doing great, but I think what we all really wanna know is how Jenna is doing.
Love country Jeffree
Ok but scorpio and cancer— both fit their zodiac signs to a T . Textbook stereotypical cancer & scorpio
Idc abt y’all but forever and always supporting Shane 💕
That makes me so sad... I love and watch YouTube every day, it's not dead to me 🥺
They appear genuine whether their opinions will be seen as popular or not. Nay-sayers are steadily being revealed as oppressors who need to move on. Let people grow! Let people live.
Jeffrey is too muuuuch of everthiiiiiing!! I love him!!
When Jeffree said he was leaving YouTube I immediately thought of Jenna marbles and how she got canceled and left. I think Shane should do a podcast or video with her!!
it is true he doesnt need those things good thing that he made a right decision
Wait is that song Shane singing because thats iconic and i need it on my spotify😍
Jeffree looks good and both handsome and beautiful his glowing and happy so happy for him
I love this new jeffree
I watch YouTube. TikTok is addictive, I want to choose how to spend my time and how much time I want to spend. I can come back to YouTube anytime.
Is TJ max a ghetto store in America? It’s such a good store where i live 😭
I love y’all so much 😭😭😭
i love jeffery
say what you want, js literally has one of the best makeup pallets out there
I missed you two together 🥲
J is so sexy butch and masc no make up.
Hahaha when he pulled out the gun with the silencer 😂😂😂😂
Rich people never suffer the consequences of their behaviour but they think they do (the so scene it’s the proof of it). It amazes me every time how can you be so detached from reality wow
Youtube isn't dead Voldemort - it's dead for you and your minion Peter, who shouldn't have come back before Jenna Marbles did. Stans may forget - but other people won't. You still haven't done proper apology yet. Now that you got therapy you should start fixing your faults.
I love who Jeffrey has become.
Got Damn look at that hunchback!
Moving to Carper now, bye.
Show the million of views on this video, we still want YouTube videos!!!
Yaaaaaaaws!
"as long as you don't use they/them pronouns, you're good!" STOP LMAO
Rylands outfit change 🤣
That ending... he isn't wrong... this was 2 weeks ago and it has 2mil views. 3 years ago it would have been 20 million!
I absolutely love this for Jeffree. He deserves it.
Idk wat Jeff talking about I'm always on YouTube
Sam , Colby and Jeffree?
as a cattle farmer...this is oddly cool?
Ryland is so me
I WOULD PAYY TO SEE SHANE AND JEFFEREE DO A HAUNTED EXPLORING SERIES OMFGGG
i totally watch youtube and always will
"No one's watching no one cares youtube sucks..." Jeffree I watch youtube more than any other platform.  .... I felt so sad when he said no one cares. Especially after he said that he prefers the long from content so much more than tick tock.... 😞😣
The audacity.
Never watched Jeffrey but do love him in Shane's videos I think it's a good power move there is so much more going for Jeffrey and if YouTube isn't focusing on other things and stopping is a good idea I don't want to lose Shane though I literally don't have many YouTubers to watch and love Shane and Rylands videos and podcasts xx
the kids youtube channels however are POPPIN
Honestly I feel so bad for both of them , yea they made very bad decisions in the past but I feel like they both become a better person it’s like when big creates makes one mistake everyone dehumanizes them. They are people who are going to make mistake just like everyone else and people really need to see that, I wish the best for Jeffrey and so happy that he is making decisions to better himself and his happiness.
I’m in love with these two together. They should never be apart
I love seeing Jeffree this happy :)
People need to get over the damn killing animals for meat. That's kind of their point tbh
I lived in WY and I miss it every day
JEFFREE'S GLOW UPPPPP DANG
"ex-yack-ly".... lmao worth the entire video for that one joke.
YouTube is dying so I get why
Missed ya'll together so much!!!
Many many things and thoughts. I'll leave the longest thought on the final video but for now 1) YouTube DOES fucking suck. But. It's still my favorite place to come for my actual favorite people. TV doesn't provide the same connection. 2) if Jeffree wants to leave I 100% support him even though it'll break my heart. One of the few and only people I feel like is true and Raw about anything these days....
Purses can't make another, livestock can. they also  love and feed the soul and body.
We need a UFO hunting video on the Star Yak Ranch!!!!!
Wow Jeffree’s growth and awareness is inspiring ❤😢
8:12 Chris speaks for the people 💀💀💀
Literally, Jeffree is amazing. He's actually reallllly funny too :)
The yak meat scenes are horrible… dead animal and then showing the happy yaks in the field, so disturbing
So Jeffrey chooses which animals get to live and which get to die… and they’re all laughing about it… so weird, do they not realise they’re real live animals with thoughts and feelings.
ok I adore you all
😢noooooo Jeffrey!!!
Let me just say…. SHANE, RYLAND, CHRIS AND JEFFREE. That’s it, that’s the comment. 🖤💗🖤💗 I love y’all so much xx
I really enjoy Shane’s documentary series he shows everything about the music industry and is so authentic canceled where???
I’m so proud of both of you for doing better & what’s best for your mental health, disconnecting from the material things is soooo Important & being in nature is beautiful for the soul. Shane so proud of you for being confident in yourself & loving yourself, seriously congrats to both of you!
No one cares abt u Jefree, doesnt mean youtube has ended..really u can be so self centered
Shane u work out..thats a news🙄
Jeffree pulling off a gun like a lipstick ⚰️
We are still watching youtube, and I’m proud of you jefree
Sadly this is true YouTube is ending its era or at least for a while. Even me a big fan of YouTube spend more time on tiktok.
Me only going to YouTube to watch Shane and Morgan and rylands videos lol
Yow lol Jeff pulled out gun lol careful
I can’t wait to meet you guys
Yea 2.5 years later ❤ 😂😊
I mean...I'm still watching YouTube...
I really hope what Jeffree is saying about youtube isn't true. I watch YouTube almost exclusively and I dont want to have to go anywhere else ...this is my online home.
4:00 before watching the rest of the video I was like....Jefree is going to quit the makeup industry for the life change JUST MY THOUGHTS and or get back with nate which is not ever going to be real other than that...idk what else
NO.
YouTube is my main source of entertainment, I hate to see it replaced by TikTok
I would buy a Shane and jeffree 2 palette
I wanna go to the yak ranch 😂
That's not true about Youtube, it's as popular as ever. Millions of people use it for entertainment; I watch more Youtube than TV!  The reason Jeffree's videos aren't doing as well is because he doesn't post frequently enough. We would love to see more updates from Star Ranch. I also don't think his ego will be able to handle it and he will come back eventually.
That's so true about phones and so good that Jeffree is off his now
How come Jeffree doesn't drink but smokes pot?
Jeffree telling the story of how he almost died, and then immediately showing off how fast his hummer can go....
27:30 Jeffree really turned his life around, he looked so unwell back then. He looks much healthier now and obviously has better priorities
It's kinda crazy that Jeffree spent all this money renovating the new house, only to hardly use it and then sell it
The gun stuff is so gross TBH. Like it's really not cute Jeffree. I've never held a gun either Shane!
Not true, people still watch YouTube. I think a lot of people like myself are put off that Jeffree is unnecessarily introducing these adorable Yaks to the meat market and purposely creating a demand for this animal to be slaughtered in order to turn a profit. It’s a bit off…
I guess he is right. I only have like 3 people that I watch on YouTube for entertainment: Shane, Ryland and Colleen and that's really it. What I use YouTube for mostly now is finding how to do something irl or on WoW and that's my YouTube experience these days. Back before 2020 I would only watch YouTube and watch several different people daily. I do however spend hours on TikTok.
Legit will never stop watching YouTube, I don’t have tiktok and likely won’t be downloading it.
Talks about getting into an accident and immediately after starts driving 100mph.... ok
Just looked to see how long I watched YouTube last week and it was 54 hours, 7 minutes 😵‍💫 lol
This video brought me soo much serotonin
Jeffreee is sexy as fuck all masculine 😫🥵
Wait why did they get canceled??
Shane, you did SO much better Anxiety wise on the 🛫  good for you, sweetheart! ✊  I could NEVER! I'd freak tf out even WITH 3mg Xanax 😌 I wish I could live that luxuriant life for ONE day. Seems I've always been disadvantaged but I feel like I'm more in tune with others no matter who they are...Living on $1000 a month single mom but we're"okay"  Working my way to success.  by this time next year I'll be closer to my lifelong goal (a house) for me and my kids. Happy to see you all together again. Jeffree and all of you look SO much better, seem happier, and I agree with you, Shane: More humble! You can still be wealthy and practice humbleness and still be a little flashy.
I love watching Jeffree on YouTube but if he feels like he needs to move on then it's ok ... I watch all different YouTube videos everyday ... I have several chronic autoimmune diseases and sometimes can't get out of bed so watching TV is all I have some days ...
I don’t know if either of you are good people, but I do know…if you got business, I’m gonna be minding it. That’s a certainty.
Do Shane's videos usually go back and forth this much? The timeline is all over the place. Why do we keep going back to his closet. It's so distracting I have to keep skipping bits
Why is Ryland always lying on the couch like he's sick?
Guns??? That's it, I'm done.
Awww shane is back!!! ❤️❤️❤️ can't wait til he bring up how toddlers are "sexy" and looking up CP
That’s kinda true I don’t really watch YouTube anymore Jeffree is right it’s all about TikTok now days 😢
I know Jeffree needs to do what he feels is best for him, but to dismiss all of us on YouTube who have been here as diehard supporters, through the ups and downs, since day 1 is a bit upsetting. I don’t feel like he should be saying “no one clicks on my videos” when there are plenty of us that watch every single one
I don't watch Jeffree's videos so I don't know how many subscribers and views he has but tbh with you, I'm bigger on YouTube than I am on Tik Tok. I have a Tik Tok account but I don't get on much. It's like once every few months I'll check it. I just don't really care. Makes me wonder why I even still have an account lol but there's people I enjoy following. Close friends and my idols.
I could sense a difference in Shane as soon as he appeared on camera. I couldn’t put my finger on what it was until just now. Confidence. It’s the confidence, he’s got it! His whole image literally WAS lack of confidence, and that’s gone now. I’m loving this new Shane. It’s going to take a lot more bullshit to bring him down ever again, and no one has the capacity to do that. Loving this new era. ❤
“A good heart and soul!” 😆❤️ Jeffree really does seem so happy and authentic. I love this.
Jeffree , I still love YouTube ! I watch everyday.
Wow I gott say theres been youtubers I’ve just stopped watching randomly and jeffree is one of them but seriously i love seeing him and shane together
Are they releasing a pallet called “Cancelled”…. I’d buy it 😂
Shane, you are such a Drama Queen!.. Bit overreaction?
Love this series but the yak meat makes me so sad 😭
I mean jeffree is not wrong about no one clicking anymore. Look at the views from this to the first series done with jeffree. It’s sad but true🤷🏻‍♀️ YouTube is dying no matter how many say “I’m still here!”
SO WHEN IS THE PALETTE BEING RELEASED????👀👀 I’d buy it haha! Love yous. Your friendship has survived everything! You deserve some peace J star 🥰
shane: filming a third sad attempt at a youtube comeback   jeffree: no one watches youtube anymore, i did it all♥️♥️ i contaminated yellowstone with my makeup! it's time to rest 😋
Why not just drive to Wyoming it’s like a 3-4hrs drive
Lol I’m here every lunch to watch both of y’all’s video 😭💕 but ily guys
Jeffree hating on Youtube and saying it's done... Yet here I am watching the video! I don't follow all the TikToks so this is my way of keeping up. Sad if it's the end!
Clicked off in the first 50 seconds
ok but the gun part feels really weird for a Canadian... I was shocked.
They’re my favorite humans, when they’re together in a video I’m constantly smiling ❤
Youtube is my comfort place
I love you tube I still watch
Really heart broken over Jeffree leaving YouTube. We watch, we care. 😢
Love how this got 2.5
ρгό𝔪σŞｍ
anyone else notice and change in Jeffree? i love it
I cackled so hard at the echo of jeffree saying " hi, how are yaaa!"
my favorite part of the video was the ketamine part
I get Jeffrey quitting Youtube but it’s so sad and I know someday you probably will too but I’m really hoping that never happens<3
this brings me peace. i love seeing how unbothered and how uninvolved in the toxicity, that is social media, they are.
I did something I was not supposed to do at my job. I had to make egg salad for the residents, and there was extra green pepper from another dish and not enough eggs to follow the recipe precisely. So, I used the pepper to fill in the rest. The next time I can, I’m going to add the diced ham that is always left over as well. Denver egg salad. I thought I should share it here in case this is something you both might want to eat as well. You get more fiber, vitamins, minerals, protein… flavor palette expanded… choose a lean ham cut if you can as the mayo with the more fatty cuts might be too much
I hate that Jeffree feels no one cares about YouTube anymore 😢 It's literally half of what I watch. Of course I still watch Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff, too. But I still LOVE YouTube and follow lots of channels religiously and SO look forward to new uploads!
Idc what anyone says and idgaf about the whole “cancel culture” stuff because it’s stupid as hell. I just need to say I am SO PROUD of Shane for how far he has come!!! I will forever love Shane Dawson no matter what!!!
Always loved Jeffree Star, but I love the new Jeffree!
*No one watches youtube*  Me on YouTube 🥺😅
Awh breaks my heart to hear </3 "No one cares anymore" WE DO <3 but yes views/engagement everywhere is down, people are morphing and shifting. Youtube still needs you Jeffree, they need the new you..
All your flashbacks make me cry! Because I remember watching those videos! And it was so long ago 😭 and I’m getting so old. Things have changed so much. For everyone. Bro getting old makes me anxious
These videos are so incredible long cus Shane drags stuff for way too long instead of just fuckin say what he means. So annoying.
I haven't watched YouTube in almost a year. But I had to watch this.
YouTube is the best platform
Nooo we r watching Jeffery x don’t go bish!
“because of my cancellation his products ended up at tj max” 😭😂😭😂🤍
I just love them together want to see more videos of them together
shane and jefree spooky series sounds amazing thooo!!
I love JS, just watching him transform from MySpace to being done with YouTube is AMAZING. I’ll always buy his products
Me, watching this series on YouTube😳😭💔
I love love love you two together 💕💖 God really has some special plans for each of you... He loves you all so much 🥰 -Mindy
Jeffrees sense of humor felt so familiar and refreshing. He seems so much happier and grounded compared to the others. Also I LOVE how self aware everyone is about the drama and how they welcome talking about joking about it.
I’m waiting for the day that Jeffree stars yak meat is so known it’s sold in stores.🤩 excited for the future for both of you
Whoever does your editing is awesome!! I was eating my cheese and crackers and I had cheese projectiling out of my mouth from laughing so much😂😂🤣🤣
One purse could buy a house for someone that really needed it and then some. THATS INSANE. So proud of Jeffree
I don't do TikTok, so I'll miss you. I only watch YouTube.
it's crazy how their cancellations have made them isolate and double down more and it's everyone else that's wrong, that's why you're completely shut out from everyone who isn't your family 😭😭
lol rich people say they work so hard then they're like. yeah actually i don't have to be face to face with anyone at my company to run it and their day just consists of filming tiktoks lol
i'm soo not materialistic anymore, but i've made a filthy amount of money selling my 11-bedroom mansion, selling my hundreds of exclusive luxury designer goods, let me tell you about my multi-million dollar property, how i'm making additional income murdering my pet yaks when i'm already a multi-millionaire, my new electric hummer..::::.........i just wanted a more humble life, yknow? 🤭
Jeffrey is a total icon.   He made us see the humble zero to a ten. Glam and wild. To subtle and mute. Such 💯💯💯💯
ICONIC making the "Sooooo?" As a moto. Cmon thattt just made someeoneeesss lifeeee turnnn upside down .
OKAY WHEN THE GATE ... OPENED. I WAS SHOOKED. GAHD DAMNNN...
I still watch YouTube.. am I old 🤣
Oh my god the take off!! I love it! 😂
YouTube is my favourite platform and I hope people continue to post! I watch it everyday
Omg jeffree should open a gay club in Wyoming!
I love youtube. :( I dont think id ever stop watching videos.
God shane has become so unbearable to watch. Im 27 and use to watch him in 7th grade!! Back when he did shanaynay.   But, god… all this fabulous attitude gay shit, is too much.   His brand of being “fat” is just so fucking cringe man. He Truly has become a one trick pony.
The DIA suckkksssss
What really got me about Jeffrees new house was that he had just bought it, and wasn't even done fully renovating it before all of a sudden moving to Wyoming.
When he said "Shane I ride yaks, I get it"  I was expecting ryland to say that Jeffree was hitting on Shane instead of "I'll cook you right up!" LOL
My hometown is Casper.
jeffree is so fcking funny god damnit i missed this
Jeffree saying no one watched YouTube while Shane’s there to make a YouTube series🧐
I love you guys together
The editing is confusing a little, I don't know which is new and which is old clips.
I still watch YouTube, for enjoyment. Shane, try guys, Jeffree, Sam and Colby and others
"I like to travel but not with Elton John" hahahahahah that cracked me up
Jeffree is actually handsome underneath the fem wigs and make-up. He looks like a twink.
Noooo I have nothing to watch on YouTube jefree CAN NOT hang his boots up yet! 😢
Casper is like 4 hours drive from Denver. Why not just drive there??
now jeffree probably had less expenses & lower taxes then ever and makes a living killing animals when he definitely doesn't need that money.....idk personally i don't want or need to see a multi millionaire talking about the hundreds of thousands they made from selling their luxury shit. money is the only reason he's able to pretend to have this Material Possessions Don't Matter! moment in the first place.
Shane if you love those Gucci sneakers you should get some balenciaga sneakers! They come in all different colors!
Wyoming is the 4th biggest state.
This editing style is so disorienting. Like it’s so uncomfortable. I guess it’s just hard to get into it when it’s jumping all over the place. 😅
Did you know last year my hubby went to jail had to start selling all my stuff to survive to take care of my kids had to sell all my makeup collections but one thing I did not sell was the conspiracy collection I said I rather starve lmao you know how happy I am to have you guys again together I feel whole again you guys were my light. And can’t waitttttt for the next collection ready to break the internet again …..???????❤❤❤❤
shane you are adorable 💯 whenever I watch you and Jeffree together it's like looking and siblings just remember Shane fam is fam whether it is in blood or not
Where is the hate for Shane…
I would watch a 20 minute long video of Jeffree and his yaks lol. YouTube still has a place.
It's refreshing to see that someone who once were so materialistic now is more grounded and fine with a bit less things.
Me listening to how much money Jeffrey‘s purses were while I am at work making minimum wage and living off tips which ppl think that $.63 is a good tip Slay pussy, queen
What kind of tequila is this?! ❤❤
im so proud of them and you! life is far more important then social media by far and forever! nothing better then being humble, and living the country life! howdy ;)
So I got the breeze comforter and OH MY GOD!!! Absolute game changer, thanks shane!!!
Ergh
Constructive criticism:  your new videos are a bit too long and could be made into 20/25 min videos. Your old ones where really fresh, new and exciting. So watching an hour long episode was enjoyable because it was so different!  But I feel that these videos are a little to stretched out I get that you put A LOT of effort into these videos but it’s just how I feel as a viewer  Maybe explore a new area like the conspiracy videos or even a video on how you are feeling and the heat you got in 2020 because I feel like we missed your side of the story
Jeffrey os now a barn daddy ❤️
Anyone know the song during the ad at the beginning of the video?
SHANE!!!!! YOU NEED TO DO AN ESCAPE ROOM WITH JEFFREE
“Pulls out a suppressed pistol” lmfao that’s amazing
Sometimes I wonder if Shane blames himself for everyone he was close to being canceled am hope he realizes that is not  what happened 🤔
That tik tok of that person saying Shane looks fatter in person is deeply upsetting. I can’t believe someone would do that. So mean and evil. And Shane even blurred out the name of whoever posted that knowing people would have come for him/her. He’s always the bigger person and it just doesn’t seem fair for him.
SHANE TALK TO JENNA
Stopped supporting morphe after the way they treated you. Now they are filing for bankruptcy which goes to show you jeffree did far more for them than the other way around.  I can't wait to come see the retail store. I love your new life and animal's so much and obsessed with your makeup.
I literally watch YouTube every day
I love Jeffery’s Wyoming vibes
im sending much love and light to jeffery and shane & ryland and his team. Im happy everyone seems to be finding their true selves
Am I old for coming home and instantly getting on YouTube to relax😂😂
i think youd be a happier person if you stopped calling yourself fat every five minutes dude
OGs know ho far Shane has come for flying out of the Denver international airport
So good to see Jeffrey in a healthy space.
I fucking love the so...? energy. Adopting that forever
I forget in other parts of the country it is unusual to see guns everywhere lol.
i thought fat azz was cancelled. both of them.  why he got 2m views when they were awful a few months ago.  Cancelled with no sponsors
buffy sponsoring this series is iconic
I sit here watching this man wondering why? Anyone can make this content. It’s a mess. A man walking around with his house being nervous and dramatic over every little thing. If he didn’t know Jeffrey star he’d have no subject or concept. It’s literally a home video any average American male can make. At least his conspiracy videos “also poorly executed” have a supposed concept. I don’t get the appeal. Y’all need higher entertainment standards. 😂
DROP THE PALETTE please :)
@8:25 That edit 🤣
*holds gun in gay* 🤌🏻✨
the stars must be BEAUTIFUL at night out there 35:38
No one cares I check 24/7
I care so fucking much
I felt bad being angry at jeffree after every drama that occured from the past years. Now i do forgive him coz i realized that everyone deserves forgiveness and a fresh start. Reason we -his viewers, became disappointed at some parts of him is the fact that we love him and we dont want to see him loose what he already accomplished. We love you jeffree and shane
It's strange how THIS Jeffree has inspired me to do what makes me happy <3
i was really having fun watching, but hein jeffree was too exicted about the gun.......disgusting
Love Jeffrey and Shane together 😍💞
Every german when jeffree drives "fast"....meh 😂😂
Im honestly enjoying the series love seeing them together
I’ve been watching your channel from the very beginning before you got fired from JC. I love you always and forever and these series you put out send me, I love thiis I love you I love you!!!!
I just want to say. I've never felt you guys. I always watch all your content and if Jeffree leaves YouTube my heart will break. I don't do TikTok or insta or the Twitter I'm just an old fashioned YouTube and Facebook girl. I guess I have to get on getting on huh
No shade. Wishing you both all the best. I used to love watching ur videos…watching these videos from Iran, in the middle of a revolution ..I realized how privileged and first world all of ur dramas and problems and complaints are. I don’t even remember what i got out of watching these videos. That being said, i wish u all nothing but the best in life. Just not for me anymore i guess.
" I need a few calories" literally me lol
Just to give you a heads up Shane, there is a scammer pretending to be you replied to some of my comments trying to get people to contact them on telegram!
I would love to a haunted series with Shane & Jeffree! That would be awesome to watch!
He’s definitely right about YouTube. I barely come on here… I’m literally here for this video only
Jeffree saying that "YouTube sucks" was one of the funniest things I've heard in a while!
OMG THE STRANGER THINGS PIN BALL MACHINE IM LIVING
Shane still having the first pair of shoes that Jeffree got him a couple years ago was surprising!
"No one watches Youtube anymore" Bitch I do! Every single day! I have so, SO many videos saved that give me serotonine and dopamine and channels that I watch daily, videos that remind me why I shouldn't be suicidal, videos that ease me out of anxiety and even calm me out of a full blown fucking panic attack! I don't remember when I've opened up my TV, seriously. I watch Youtube every single day. I even fall asleep to some of my favourite creators because instead of my own thoughts, I hear their familiar voices. Listening to certain Youtubers just speak when I'm trying to fall asleep have even caused my night terrors and nightmares to be less often happenings.
hahaha omg i feel personally attacked by Jeffery while I am watching Shanes youtube series lol
I wish the background music & background sounds were just a bit quieter than the talking
Jeffrey saying no-one watches anymore YouTube.  Me: 👁️👄👁️💧
Shane kinda looks like he smells, maybe its the extra weight
I used the blood lust palette and conspiracy palette for my wedding in March 😭♥️
Honestly, I don't have TikTok, I still go to YouTube for just chilling.
You better be bringing out this palette you made and never brought out.  I want it.   💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
😭soo sad!
I'm going to be honest I don't watch YouTube like I used to I'm usually on tiktok or doing stuff that isn't on my phone just living in the moment I come here to watch Shane and that's it
I hate watching stuff about rich people. Dont get me wrong, i love shane and Jeffrey, theyre both amazing, but every time i hear about the money its like..well, ok, ill never own a home, but at least youre happy 😥
You tube might not be the hype but it will outlive tik tok I hope. Too many real educational tools, entertainment,  creativity etc...maybe Jeffery is just bitter that he's canceled. Only LA tracks social media like that. Where as most of America enjoys all the platforms.
Jeffree star better never quite you tube !! I totally care 😢
You guys helped me a lot of my depression. Thank you for everything. Jeffree and Shane, you are a gift.
I can just imagine a farmer looking out from his tractor and seeing the hummer “there’s Jeffree doing his lil car trick again”… 😅😅😅
wow what a difference! you can see the growth of jeffery, so nice to see. it’s so funny, you see so many celebs saying “ all i want is to live on a farm with my animals and away from everything” and it’s like SO GOO ! you have the means so shut up and go! i think i’m more talking about kendall’s recent comment on the kardashian saying how she wants to leave and it’s like girl? so go!
Always loved Jeffree! But I love how he has evolved and how he’s so much more grounded and giving back💕
The first part of the video was filmed on my birthday 🥰
PLEASE DONT LEAVE YOUTUBE i STILL WATCH /:
I STILL CARE ABOUT YOUTUBE
I regret not buying the conspiracy palette
Shane with a gun is literally me with any minor inconvenience that arises in my life 😂
i want that palette
Jeffrey is SO entertaining to watch
I watch because I care 😭
Whenever people visit us out in the country, they also get the royal tour including shooting a gun if they never have.
I appreciate that Jeffery is finally doing something more meaningful with his life. I definitely was a huge fan of his and I’m glad that he’s leaving his drama filled past behind him. On to bigger and better things stay blessed ❤
This makes me sad because I’ve always loved y’all and still do. I have always watched Jeffrey for enjoyment and because his content made me happy and I had a connection with it! It’s understandable though with how many negative people are on here though.
😭😭I'm so happy your back making some videos I missed you so much lmao your videos give me life
I'm very happy for Jeffree and the crazy thing is, the other day I just started thinking about him and who knows it might be the Scorpio thang but when I thought about him I was wondering how was he doing, and I got a sense of peace? Then I get this notification and it's Shane reuniting with his bestie.....who has finally found some tranquility in his life? Ugh! I really wish I could afford "Cremated or Conspiracy" as a  birthday present to myself(HAPPY BIRTHDAY MONTH, SCORPIOS!!! 🥰🦂♏🎂🥂🍾🎈🎁🎉🎊)  but being a mom has to always come first! I swear(IMO)nobody puts together a color coordination like Jeffree Star! Shane is such a sweetheart, I wish them both noting but the best. 🌈🌟🌞
I just want to say to both you and Jeffree keep striving to want what you want to achieve, and Jeffree thank you for all you have done with releasing your life to us and showing us behind the person we see on the camera. Hope you enjoy farming and wish you the best. 👌 Shane you as well thank you for letting us follow you and your journey over the years, you both are amazing, I wish you and your family the best.
Jeffrey should really write a book - he’s so inspiring and had such an interesting life. Would love to read all about it 🤩
Giving me so many new songs to listen to ! I love this and everything you do !
Si peaceful seeing how much he grew 😊
I am loving the new Jeffree! Wyoming looks good on him!
I guess i am just an old youtuber lover. It's all I know. please don't go lol I am here.  I am clicking.
OMG, in CASPER WYOMING. MY HOMETOWN. SO CRAZY. I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF THERE.
I miss the old YouTube days 💔
I meannnn I still watch YouTube basically every day..... But I am 35, so he's not wrong.
I honestly love Shane and Jeffrees friendship. They’re awesome together!
“No one watches youtube anymore” - yet views are in the millions/very high hundred thousands. That's pretty high, hun.  We all love YouTube, comments like this has people shook bcuz it's still home and escapism for so many. And now we’re scared its gna be taken. So don't give in to TikTok & stay true to what's fun and fuels you. There's enough people in the world (8 billion) to watch across both - it doesn't have to be either or ❤  Also, Shane - banging vids. We missed you xxx
his last video has 1m views....  no one watches it in my ass
i legit love this side of jeffree and you shane! literally......like......so??? not giving a shit about what others think is so damn freeing and refreshing!
I love YouTube 🥺 I get on it daily. I don't have tiktok
Im still watching yt for enjoyment..
I agree to an extent with Jeffree I used to rush to YouTube daily but in the past 2 years I click less and less.
I miss the old camera guy…the red head dude. Can’t remember his name rn.
Shane please don’t quit YouTube. We need you!
I have no idea what’s going on with this time line lol
Shane being terrified of the pew-pew 🔫 sent me 😂😂😂 also I’m so happy for Jeff. So glad to see him in such a downnto earth space and being so raw and natural. He is a beautiful person. I support him. Cancel culture is evil and honestly those people are just trying to keep themselves looking innocent.
20:50-21:09 LMAO 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Haunted series please 🥺👉🏼👈🏼
I still watch Youtube 😢 I dont like any other platform now as its too toxic
Keep being you Shane ❤️❤️
I love them so much 🥺✨❤
Jeffree is absolutely over analyzing, (as most perfectionist tend to do) he is absolutely fascinating and the parts of his life that he believes are boring and mundane are truly interesting just because of his personality
All i do is watch youtube 😭😭😭 Im going to miss Jeffery so much. He looks so healthy & happy though I cant be mad. Thank you for so many years of entertainment. This is a sad day 😢🤍
Jeffree: "... What's my motto for the year.., 'SO?!' " then laughs because he has changed so much and is no longer phazed by the old type of drama. Now, he takes things easy, is only on his phone for a fraction of time and is now FULLY ENJOYING and LIVING LIFE - peacefully.
really glad to see you guys on my screen again
YOUTUBE WILL ALWAYS BE MY HOME. i will never stop clicking, but i support your decision to move to bigger and better things jeffree <3
Grown men telling little girls how to dress
Wyoming paranormal hotspots  Shane and Jeffree x Sam and Colby - Collab 👀🤯😍
Sad the hear Jeffrey won't be making more YouTube videos. I'm more interested in this type of video over makeup reveals or tutorials.  I watch YouTube daily still, but not as many hours as I used to.  Love you two!
the world is finally healing
i love all of yalls content yall are raw and real and im here for it i hope jeffree doesnt quit youtube for good i watch every video yall upload and yall are proof that the storm does pass and brighter days are ahead. stay strong yall got this <3
Literally the only videos I care to watch are when you and jeffree are together, like fuck I’ve waited for this for 2 years. If there’s any reason to continue like it’s fucking together. This duo SLAYSSSS
Too much music, too much sound effects
Literally me coming home from work and going to YouTube… me literally watching YouTube right now
I love this!!!! I missed you guys
Im on YouTube daily all day, I don't watch TV at all anymore... PS I love this jeffree
A rebirth pallet! Like, a Pheonix themed.
Well not Jeffree and Shane making me freaking sob my eyes out 🥺. You guys are doing so amazing omgg, genuinely so so so so so proud of the two favourite people of mine I love you guys so much keep flourishing 🧡🧡
A lot of us care and I'm just hearing this now because I have been off social media for about 2 weeks so I'm trying to get caught up and hearing that he's done I mean no offense to the channel I'm watching us on right now but I watched Jeffrey now as of November 2022 more than I watch Shane so this is a little hard to handle Jeffrey's like a bright spot you know like you could be having an awful day and he just watched one of his reviews of makeup and even if it's not make up you ever intend to use or want to use or it's not right for your skin or your color whatever you still watch it because it's him and you're spending 20 minutes or 25 minutes with him! Like you're catching up with a bestie for a half hour. This sucks big time I pray he keeps his channel up so even though I've seen the videos and I'll end up seeing them three times over I'll just have to keep rewatching them
I still love youtube and click into it every day and binge watch a whole bunch of videos. Sad to see Jeffrey leave the platform though
Jeffree looks so good!! When he walked in with maddie he literally was glowing ❤ bless his little cotton socks I’m so happy for him. Shane and co also seem really content too. I’m so glad the moves out of CA and stepping out the spotlight has chilled everyone out. I’d rather this lot be happy and content rather than wearing themselves out online xxx
I'd still watch you jeffree
Just 5k.. and I’ll be set for a good couple months! Be able to pay rent and not have to worry
YES....
If this doesn’t end in a release of this pallet I’m gonna lose my shit 😂
This side of Jeffrey is awesome, as long as he is happy. That’s all that matters ❤❤❤❤❤
It' not bc no one watches Your videos, than YT is dead. Besides, Jenna Marbles came back.
Jeffrey is dead wrong about YouTube being dead.... like SOOO WRONG. i think after he got canceled it just wasn't worth it to him.
i’m telling you right now youtube is my favourite platform. i’m straight on when i wake up xxxx
He’s got a point. YouTube is downhill now
Instant gratification if Tik Tok has so many people spoiled. Nobody wants to commit 5 minutes anymore. I prefer a longer video but I’m also retired and while I stay busy, I also make my own schedule. I can work on tiling my sunroom floor at 2am if I cut my tile earlier because the tile cutter machine I bought is loud and will wake up my hubby who is still working and Son who is in college.
wouldn't HAVE, not wouldn't OF.
I love youtube!!!!!!!! Don’t leave
Kinda sad that it's something involving killing beings that don't need to b killed
Why does Jeffrey look soo good? Soo different but like in the best way possible
This video feels like when you meet up with your friends that you haven’t seen in a long time but when you get together it’s like nothing changed at all.
Not jeffree going 89 I wish I lived in Wyoming 😂😂😂
Cats
Well this is awkward…. As I’m watching this on YouTube lol.
Why did Shane get cancelled ?
Made me wanna pull out my conspiracy palette 😁 do something magical
I'm still watching.. I'm still clicking.. Especially on Shane and Jeffree
the energy between this 2 is everything I was laughing non stop since they reunited at the airport and the whole ride to the ranch 😅😅😅 living fot this documentaries
I don't remember ever seeing Jeffree be this quick-witted or cleverly funny before.  I love it.
I actually agree with Jeffrey. I'm still on YouTube vs tik tok.i also never drink just smoke lol 🤣
I'm just living and loving how this 2 had become this past few years u can tell they are happier and more content and hello 👋🏼 I still watching the videos lol huge fan and won't go anywhere!!!! love u guys and love the friendship u 2 have 💜❤💗
I can feel and see how much happier and grounded Jeffree is. I'm truly happy for him.
Why am i attracted to Jeffree for the first time? That hat.. the happiness… he is fine
I’m still on YouTube…. The problem is there’s nothing good to watch. It’s harder to find channels that feel wholesome and entertaining. The channels I watch are still getting a ton of views so I’m not sure what Ryland is talking about when he said YouTube is difficult for everyone right now?
I still watch YT ever day. Last 2 weeks I’ve watched some friends on twitch; but honestly twitch culture is so grating and I hate it.   Doesn’t mean Jeffree has to do YT, he should keep doing things where his interest leads, but I’m a YT person. (I have premium YT, and I don’t have any other sub services.)
I will forever remember you Shane and Jeffry. Jeffry stated that no one cares about YouTube no more but i do! YouTube is the only thing I have now having other social medias stressed me out! But now i feel so much better after deleting them. You guys are the reason why i love YouTube so much so thank you.
If I were rich like Jeffery, I'd have a big house and several decent size apartments. I'm surprised he doesn't live in a hotel.
You shouldn't be deleting comments it's a bad look 🙄
He should make a blood diamond pallet with jewel inspired colors
When he said no one watches his YouTube anymore I went to his channel and nearly every video has over 1M views 😅
YouTube is not dead.. maybe for his type of content but no.. YouTube overall is not dead
Lol. Shane saying that he uses their products every night we just saw you at pottery barn 😂
Tik tok is where it’s at, but I’m sure they don’t pay as much as YouTube right
Eyebrows wow looks good
Omg!! We need some videos of y’all ghost hunting!! Please make this happen! 😅👻  29:29
Jeffree being an elevated woke Scorpio we love to see it ❤🙌🙌
I love that Jeffree includes everyone in the conversation 🥹
We need a paranormal Series with you two and we need it now
He better not quit YouTube I swear
Love him lol unapologetically vain and humble at the same time. Hard not to admire it. You two are honestly friendship goals lol
Love him lol unapologetically vain and humble at the same time. Hard not to admire it. You two are honestly friendship goals lol
Make haunted series with Jeffree PLEASE!! Im begging
So dumb saying nobody cares about YouTube anymore when everyone be on YouTube everyday so many people uploading videos everyone watching tiktok is very short and simple YouTube is more longer and you can sit back and watch tiktok too short
22:38 I was fucking dying laughing jeffree teaching Shane to hold to the gun and he's like 😵😵‍💫 I haven't laughed this hard in so long. I love when you guys make videos together! Its everything And it literally breaks my heart jeffree is quitting YouTube no 😥 I also can't get over how good he looks like wow!
Youtube is all i have!! 😭😭😭
Wait… what? Where the fuck do I get my jeffree content? Please not the tok…
I’m just speculating at what he’s going to drop, I’m only at the start of the video and I haven’t read comments, I’m thinking sex change? Seems like a big personal change right? Let’s see!
as a Wyoming resident, I love this video!
Whattttt I watch 😅
Glad to see how you have both evolved and become happier by just chilling out. I was surprised Jeffrey is quitting YouTube but his audience has largely moved on. It’s not that the platform is dead, but simply the popular genres have shifted as they always do.
Jeffrey actually comes across as happy and giddy in this . He looks so happy
The music in the background is so distracting and makes everything hard to hear.
Do a gun safety from Jeffrey star and start selling your model of guns lol
Shane why you’re still F 4T? I thought you were working out, it’s so disappointing
❤
I just about shit myself when they were in the Hummer and Jeffrey pulls out the pistol with the silencer not because he had it but because he was holding it by the barrel and it was actually pointing at his own stomach and the hammer was cocked back holy shit talk about not using common sense and gun safety
im laughing so hard. i watched this after the finale..
its sad to hear jeffree wanting to leave youtube but i see his point. its always hard watching the people youve watched since almost day one leave never to return but everyone grows up at some point right? nothings the same as it was but that doesnt meant everythings bad now. i only hope that if (or when) shane decides to leave this platform he continues to do well in life <3 will always love you shane u crazy bastard lol
I’m always waiting for ryland and Shane and Morgan to upload videos it might be done fr Jeffrey but not u guys
Honestly, Jeffree star is right no one really watches YouTube how some people and me used to be obsessed with YouTube but now I’m more obsessed on watching TikTok
NOOOOOO!!!!! Jeff, whatever you create I'm gonna watch it. Please, be on YT. I personally don't like TT so I don't use it. Please, don't leave!!!
Jeffree looks so healthy now. It shows in his face that he's mentally in peace.
I feel bad but Jeffree is right. People don’t really watch utube anymore. I use to watch it all the time and now I only watch it for workout videos 😂. I watched this because it’s shane and it’s taken me ages to get through each episode and even now I have it on whilst painting my kitchen. People are addicted to short reels like tiktok because they’re quick and simple. Quick entertainment. The mind doesn’t have time to get bored and distracted. That’s the issue now, no-one has long attention spans. We’re all after a quick fix. Even when watching TV, most of us our on our phones. It’s a sad reality but Jeffree hit the nail on the head. I never watch beauty videos anymore and I used to binge watch them, but I feel once you’ve seen so many, you kinda seen them all.
This documentary reminded me that depression isn't forever. The sun too will shine again ☀️💖 thanks
I love seeing the great awakening of the world. If you are reading this, I hope you are waking up too. Remember all those YouTube videos that said the world is about to go through a great awakening? Well...don't fight it. Breathe, pray, love life and don't listen to mainstream media anymore.
I'm just here to say that Jeffree looks so beautiful without makeup. He's an absolutely fascinating human being.
I'm sorry but the 0-60 had me dying lmaooo
Jeffree: "Just don't use they/them and you will be just fine." I mean...is that still a thing? Aren't we over that fad yet anyways? 🤔    A girl can hope! 🤣
Apparently I live under a rock because I had no clue these two were canceled. I appreciate them both very much, their energy and authenticity is sunlight to the soul. ❤  If you do any paranormal stuff in Montana, DM me. I’ll show you around and we can heckle the film free of Yellowstone for ruining our peace and quiet. 😂
I just wanted to say thank you for doing this series, I was sad with all that happened and i had put my conspiracy pallet away and hadn't touched it this whole time until i finished the series and it inspired me to pull it out and use and i forgot how much i loved it so thank you keep doing you and please do more series
Jeffree is fucking hilarious tho and i am shocked at his transformation. Congrats. and more people with your resources should be doing what you’re doing as far as your ranch goes. You are responsible for a boost in economy and feeding your community. God frickkkin bless.
Im so happy for jeff makes me so so happy to know he is living his true best life
THE SILENCERRRRRRR
WOW JEFFREY I LOVE YOUR HOME AND HOMETOWN
JEFFEREY HAS EYEBROWS!!
Engagement
Lovin this series so far!
Ghost hunting videos Jeffrey stop please do ghost hunting videos because I will click on that bitch so fast!!!! 😂❤️😍
Im so sad
Yesss! Shane x Jeffree making  paranormal videos, would love to see that happen....be funny as hell♡♡♡
I’m so proud of Jeffree’s growth. He’s really matured and come into his own these last few years. I will be so sad to see him leave YouTube though. I wish he did a content change or something instead of wholly quitting but honestly it’s more important that he’s happy :)
I literally watch YouTube…I don’t have tiktok
you need to go ghost hunting in Wyoming
I have to disagree with Jeffree, I quite literally ONLY use YouTube and I miss his content and yours and am so excited when I get to see both of your guys videos. ❤ I’m not just saying that either I’m genuinely serious.
He seriously said “a glass of ketamine” 19:35 I’m gagging
Jeffrey looks so handsome 😮 no make up face
Your content is top-notch! Thank you for doing another one of these series with Jeffree! I love you both so much!
No one can convince me that Shane and Trixie Mattel hire the same voice actor to voice their lives.
So am I the only one who actually still watches a lot of YouTube contrary to what Jeffree said?
I can assure you, that is not like rehab Shane 😂 🥰 Love y'all
Crazy rich uncle definitely describes Jeffery well 😂
I think what Jeffree is talking about is the average viewer's attention span - A lot of people might prefer shorter form of content like Tik Tok. But it all could be just a phase.
wild to see Jeffree in just like .. a normal house. it's really nice don't get me wrong, but like... it's just a regular wealthy house ? i
Jeffree talking about no one watching YouTube anymore and here I am watching YouTube all day 🥺
PLEASE PARANORMAL YESSSS
I was NOT expecting Jeffree to pull out a suppressed 9mm like it was nothing.
The haunted world of jeffree star.... Has a ring to it. You both should def do a ghost hunting video in Wyoming.
Jeffree getting to be a person and actually enjoy things. He literally spent 5 minutes of a car ride showing his friends how fast it goes to 60 lol. Relaxing normal fun. 💜
Im hollering with “B.C” abbreviation 😂
The airport in Bismarck North Dakota is also super small! Only one baggage claim and 4 gates
Omg the hummer 0-60 what belly laughs are for
oh. c'mon, i'm that dinosaur, that watches only youtube, i need you guys to eat my dinners xD
I still love YouTube.
This is kinda sad :( jeffrey saying goodbye to youtube. I love jeffrey ❤️
Dont be nervious just be you we hall have some dirt in our past its how you go forth that matters and you and Jeffrey have done wonderful be proud
Not sure "Let's blow this joint!" is the best phrase to use in the airport 😆
Meanwhile…… I’m here still watching YouTube
Thanks to Buffy for showing me who you partner with so I can avoid buying your products!
I LOVE THIS! i love you shane always have always will but I think we need a haunted video with jeffree
Me personally am so down for hauntings with Shane and Jeffree
I love Jeffree. He seems at peace. But totally off topic…I live 2 hours away from Casper & one time, my car was overheating when I was leaving Casper from shopping & I actually had to park my car at the Casper airport so it wouldn’t get towed. However I had to pay to get it out of that parking lot lol. Oh the memories 😂
i feal materialistic person is just a phase to most of the people, at the end when they get it they start looking for the next level. which is peace and quiet , become one with the nature to make it full circle
At first sight when Jeffree walked in the airport I immediately thought he looks so adorable more masculine and less feminine. His no makeup boy face is super cute!  My favorite part of Jeffree is the beautiful maturing he’s done over the past couple years. It absolutely shows in his whole demeanor AND I don’t know him obviously but I am so genuinely happy for his success and now he is able to do and live how he really wants. We all never stop growing and he must have realized “what the hell am I going to do with all of this material stuff, life is short and none of it is necessary anymore”. I’ve gone through the same growth experience myself and haven’t serial addictively shopped like I used to in years. I’m left with a house full of unnecessary things with tags on them. Being Gay and childless doesn’t give us many options to leave all of our cherished possessions and memories to many people who I personally feel are worthy and deserving, especially considering I’ve seen how they take care of their own things, I’m not leaving my things to be destroyed.  Ummm I seemed to have gone down a tiny dark path whoops 😬  Sorry y’all.. Oh Shane, you have been successful and famous but I noticed you appear to  be surprised by a lot of things still, how is that possible? One of your best friends is Jeffree Starr and you have your own celebrity you must have been around a lot more than you “pretend” Lol I’m not being insulting I promise, that’s why I put quotes, I’m curious if it’s just a cute little quirky trait of yours..? ✌🏼💋 Xoxo  P.S. Wyoming instantly makes me think of our dear departed Mathew Shepherd. Does anyone else? I like to think of him as a Patron Saint who looks after the LGBT Community. Please don’t tease me for that, I can’t help but mourn Mathew regularly. He will always have a special place in my broken heart
Nooo plzzz 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I love jeffery so much plzzz
i love getting into bed and watching my fav creator's
Nooo hearing jeffree say he’s quit actually made me sad. Can you guys keep doing videos together at least cause we love them
Can you buy your camera op a stabilizer please?
Damn dude. Jeffree is pretty harsh at 53:30  I guess i don't matter for shit. Kinda was insulting to Shane as well
Living for the change. Werk kings Werk! ❤️
What Jeffree said about people not clicking on their videos is so true but I just feel they should come up with the next trend and they'll be at the top again! I love Shane and Jeffree! They deserve the best! 🤎🤠
I honestly  missed watching Shane and Jeffree together they are so entertaining and Jeffree looks so happy like a breath of fresh air, tou can definitely tell he made the right choice
@shane you should take the sweat pattern from your jacket in the airport @14:20 and brand that Rorschach'ist image onto the back of your merch.  For me, your confidence runs deeper than image and you clearly demonstrate this by including that clip of you showing your sweat in the video this way.
The camera man sucks lol
Im so glad jeffree saw the ridiculousness of the wealth bragging... especially in the world we all currently live in. Glad he downsized his life and possessions
“After getting cancelled 10 times I just wanted peace and quiet” 😂
Jeffree looks hot with eyebrows.. and I love the energy, just shows that no matter what darkness you're in , there's always light at the end of the tunnel ! Thank you for making this documentary for us :)
Ex-yak-ly…I’m dead.
Ryland wanting to impress Jeffree then one of the very first thing he says is "we don’t have much of a gay culture in Wyoming" lol. I mean obviously that doesn’t mean he can’t dress any damn way he wants. I just thought it was funny. I love Ryland the most 😻
Somebody tell me the name of the "I don't want to love another" PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU
Shane and Jeffree are literally my favorite YouTubers canceled or not idgaf. I love them separately and even more together. Their friendship is everything. I love them. And these videos.
I’m a Scorpio ♏️ and my Fiancé is a Cancer ♋️ love to see the relationship between the two of you ❤
One thing I realized is the fact that Jeffree and Shane are actually true friends. We know there has been a lot of drama the past years but their friendship is seriously so much better than any other YouTubers. Even though they're quite different and imperfect together and individually, they are still their own person. I love how they're not antagonizing each other on the internet even after the cameras are off. I wish they both get happier in the next years. Love you guys 🤍
My head exploded at the fucking suicide style gates, Jeffery is my spirit animal. It was sooo cool to see you guys get to hang out together again and If you guys don't do a haunted wyoming series I may not find the will to live. Y'all have grown up so much it fills my heart. God Bless.
I still love YouTube!! Lol
Anyone that supports cancel culture is absolutely disgusting. Yall act like you've never made a mistake before. And just how would you feel if a bunch of people discovered that mistake and got you fired from your job for it?  Not to mention publicly shamed. Humans are allowed to make mistakes because that's how we learn, grow and change. Nobody should have to spend the rest of their lives paying for it. Unless of course you literally murdered someone. Please people, let's all learn to forgive and be more understanding of each other. That's the only way this world is ever going to get any better. 🖤
Idk what he's talking about. Maybe I'm old now but I still watch and support my YouTube creators. I feel bad for him 😞
Love love loveeeeeeeee this!!! Love u guys
I love this. So much. But Jeffree! So wrong about YouTube. I come home from work and literally go straight to YouTube to see if my favorites have a new video up. I love YouTube so much more than other apps
When Shane said jeffrees plan was full circle my first thought was "omg is he buying MySpace"???
Jeffree is right, youtube is dead.
This made me happy
I don’t believe that YouTube is dead I still use it daily I actually prefer it than other streaming sites
I love YouTube I’ll be so sad if jeffree quits 😭😭
I missed you Shane
It’s true about no one watching YouTube anymore. This is my first getting on YouTube in a long time!
Not me crying wtf.. I missed this so much
jeffree has eyebrows!
Ill be so sad to never see Jeffree on yt anymore. But I understand, time to be at peace and actually enjoy life with no stress. Thank you Shane! ❤
I care
I used to watch sooooo many vlogs. But YouTube just isn’t it anymore. That shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone, especially YouTubers lmao
Is it just me or has Jeffree never looked more attractive?
YouTube is all I watch 😂
Jeffree people are just not watching your types of videos anymore, I love the videos I watch on a weekly but they were never that kind of content js
jeffree genuinely looks so much healthier
Ok but can we see how good Shane's Skin looks with using Jeffrees products?!
Well I don't watch Jeffree Star on Youtube cuz, boring, so he can think youtube sucks ...while Shane, Ryland and Morgan are rockin my world on Youtube! ❤️
Jeffree we’re still here watching you
I was like “Jeffree looks so different he probably got more surgery” he has eyebrows. He has FUCKING EYEBROWS
I watch YouTube and Jeffree Star and Shane  Dawson are the two youtubers that I watch all the time. I don't want him to  leave youtube he was the reason i get into doing youtube videos. Also his last mystery box that he did i opened it up on my channel and it got 3 thousand views on  my video which was crazy. I just love ya guys. Thanks Shane for sharing this series with us
I need that truck lol I be trying to zoom zoom 😭🤣🤣
I'm still obsessed with YouTube and shane, you will always be my favorite! I live for your videos!!! Dont ever stop!!!!
I will watch Shane for as long as he creates YouTube won’t be the same with out y’all.
I still watch you for enjoyment 🥺 🥲🥰
how has Shane never held a gun?  what??!
Jeffrey is such a good looking person. It’s insane
For someone who’s says it became sickening to be surrounded by material things & he didn’t want that anymore, he sure does like to show off his millions of dollars of material things. They’re just different things. Oh here’s my guns and my car that they only made 50 in the world, and my ranch gate that I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to have them made to open like Lambo doors.  Sorry Jeff you seem to still be trying to fill that empty hole where you’re souls supposed to be with millions of dollars of material things. I think just bc they’re different things in a different place with different people, he doesn’t recognize he’s doing the same shit he’s always done
Please make Jeffree the Godfather 😭❤️🤣 lol
The next series should be Jeffree and Shane song collab😂
I care about YT. Hell it’s my own mental escape from my life and reality. Maybe my age I’m not about the tictok. I’m only 42 but know there are ppl that still go to yt. Like I am right now. It’s my escape and ty for posting 💜💜💜
I go here for enjoyment.pretty much for shane and Ryland
It's the silencer for me 🤣
I don't watch tictok
Farmer Jeffree with eyebrows 😳
Ooff.. I'm sad! I love to watch Jeffree Star, Shane, Morgan, Ryland and the family on YouTube :/ fu**... broke my heart to hear about Jeffree.
Honestly I'm still here for Jeffree. Cancel cultural is stupid. I'm glad he's happy and still on social media.
“you tube fuckin sucks”😂 I love how real jeffery is now 💯💯💖
“I havent changed” 😂😂😂
I remember that Shane had a conspiracy about the Denver Airport and that horrifying horse statue and how it killed its creator.
PLEASE DO A HAUNTED SERIES WITH JEFFREE!!!!!!!
I go to YouTube daily and rewatch all of your series!!!
Bro I love Shane’s conspiracy theories
Shaneeeee I want more ASAP!!!!!!! This was a fking tease!!!! I 🫶 u but more please!!! Lol u Fkin tease!! Hahahaha xo
Jeffree is such an inspiration. He excels in marketing himself and what ever business venture he finds himself in. He is obviously diligent with his investing. Truly inspiring.
Mmmm.... I disagree with Jeffree on the YouTube thing.... He said "no one watches YouTube anymore", yet this video has 2.3 million views and his videos are still going on high numbers.... Girl what are we then, no one? Seriously? 2.3 million people is "no one"???
Shane and his western look ❤️
Jeffrey pulled out that gat though!!! I died laughing when Shane could barely hold it!
The only thing I watch is YouTube, but I’m in the minority I guess. But I love documentaries, nature, history. They’re so abundant here. And makeup videos, Hannah, Kackie, Kristi. It’s different for sure but not dead. Or I’m just ‘old’.
WHAT? I still watch youtube.. Am I cancelled??
jeffree’s house is my worst nightmare if there was a serial killer on the loose 😭😭
Not Jeffree pulling out a gun 🤣🤣. Love the new Jeffree🥹
I grew up in casper. I miss my hometown so much.
CAN I JOIN ON GHOST HUNTING????? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! 😃
What's the name of the song at 51:43 Please 🙏🏻
As an Uber driver, I would’ve died if you got in my car. Also, if you ever come to Tampa Fl call me. My car has been deemed the funnest car in Tampa bay 😂❤
Broooo you guys should release the pallet
I feel jeffree is so ahead of everything and so aware of things moving on.
I love Jeff
How does Jeffree look his hottest right now? And I still love watching YouTube 🤣 I'm still obsessed. No other platform can beat some of the content you can get on here, especially paranormal and true crime...paranormal should be your next route shane!!!
You should produce the palette.
😭😭😭😭 I'm still clicking....
Jeffrey said it really can’t be that shocking. Like ummmmmm what jaw dropped
Cuando fue que me suscribí de este pendejo shane?
NOOOO I DONT WANT YOU TO QUIT YOUTUBE !!!! 🥺😢😢
Ahhh I love Jeffree!!! From one CA person to another, I 100% agree with him when it comes to not wanting material but to work hard. Love it!!
Really proud of jeffree and you too Shane ❤️
New episode in 9 mins!! 😍
I completely agree with Jeffree - YouTube wasn’t like it used to be - before TikTok it was the place to go for good quality videos. Like yours Shane! But now people move on to quick cheap entertainment like Tiktok. It’s short sweet and cheap entertainment. It doesn’t compare to they kind of quality you make. But I’m here for it!!! So glad Jeffree & Shane are back together again! Some of the happiest times of my life was during the conspiracy pallet. So excited to dive back into this!
The Elton John joke lol. I love it and sir Elton 😊
I agree with Jeffree at the end, no one is watching Youtube and it's dying. Don't get me wrong, I love Youtube. But people, society, and culture are changing so much. The Youtube "Overlords" fucking suck and have made using this app and creator's using the app impossible. The joy is often gone in the content. I will still watch and use Youtube as long as the creator's I enjoy still thrive. But with TikTok and short form content taking over everything it's hard to keep up. I just hope to see other long-form video content sites like Rumble be able to compete and put Youtube in it's place.
I’m sorry about the mess. In the snow
why does jeffree have a silencer on his gun 😅
Watching this for the 4th time ... or is it 6th. Well anyhow, gettin' ready!!!
I absolutely love Shane and Jeffree together. You feel the love, appreciation and true friendship between them.
Okay but Jeffree saying he’s quitting YouTube legit made me cry. :( I watch YouTube everyday, but it could be cause I’m old school. Makes me sad :( I’ve watched all of Jeffrees videos.
idk. it makes me sad hearing jeffree say nobody cares about youtube. maybe i am boring or have no life outside of work. but i watch youtube everyday, it makes me not think about my life.
Oh damn I watch YouTube still lol
I wanna have that bathroom wallpaper. 🤣
Shane, if you're reading this, I love your videos! You and Jeffree are an unbeatable team! I would love to interview you and Jeffree for my intro to business class!
I just hope Jeffrey is killing them for food for the world not for blood lust.
Cancel culture is a thing and a risk. You both are risk takers and that is possibly the price. And you and Jeffree when through that together. And together you can rise. And love seeing the supportive bonds you all have. I always thought of Jeffree at a ranch and his money would be better put towards animals... and wow, I am amazed that that unfolded a few years later... here we are... love the updates! I want a gate like that at my ranch lol! Yes!
That's pretty. That's so pretty.
I love it but for the young fans out there please respect Jeffries privacy.
So JS is no longer popular due to his own behavior and not evolving his content so that means YouTube is obsolete 🤨🤔, ok sure sure sure 🤣. JS: we're just wasting our time (pertaining to YouTube) his last bit of hold out fans: so we're what chop liver 👀
Love you guys 😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰
Allot of amazing water energy,   Scorpio and cancer,   Really awesome energy it is heavy and is 💯 % chance of opening and closing portals, ❤
WWJD
Don’t pan down lol
That person that said to name it that should get a cut of your selling price.
Love this sooo much happy for y’all 🫶🏽🥰 new adventure !!
The filmer needs to work on the lighting transitions and actually showing good b roll <3
I’m sad to hear that Jeffrey thinks YouTube is a waste of time. Now that I finally watch YouTube lol I only started watching YouTube about four years ago. I actually pay for no commercials. I still check out his stuff usually when I see it they just don’t always recommend it. I have that problem with a lot of people I like to follow though. I didn’t see a lot of Ryland‘s recent posts because they stop putting them in my feed. But that’s OK I go looking for you guys eventually and then I’ve binged everybody lol but I am really glad that everybody seems so much happier and that there was a silver lining to what happened to all of you. That whole cancellation thing was no joke and I’m sure that would’ve been hard to live through. I am grateful that it seems like everybody grew stronger, wiser, smarter and it looks like Everyone’s doing quite a bit better. I think that you guys together is a big draw. Don’t give up. The two of you together really is good content every time. I really love you guys and Ryland and just the vibe of a bunch of friends being together.
Can i just say.. I was not expecting this with Jeffery, But the surprise was a GREAT one. You all have grown so much as people. Love it love it love it! I am so proud of him for evolving like this and giving himself space from California etc.
Jeff crosses me as a total republican 🤣
He is back 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Im still clicking 🥺
I still watch YouTube all the time. I love catching a glimpse into peoples day, it makes me feel less alone while I do my daily activities. Once YouTube dyes off fr maybe I’ll move on to therapy 😂😂
😢
Why are you highlighting and joking.about the oppression and exploitation of sentient beings? It's really sad that those from the LGBTQ community would demean and abuse other marginalized beings. It doesn't make sense.
it feels like a chapter of my life is ending too lmaoooo
I just noticed that jeffree has eyebrows 😅😳
I get such a weird since if nostalgia now watching these videos. This series almost feels like Christmas time, maybe because last time I watched a Shane/Jeffree series it was the last Christmas that kinda felt normal probably to a lot of people. I’m so happy to see both Shane and Jeffree so happy with their new lives without so much of the ugliness they experienced behind the scenes every day.
the way his ranch gate opens exceeded my expectation 👏🏻 that’s sooo jeffree‼️  and we have to welcome his eyebrows back💖
Honestly it’s sad that Jeffrey is quitting YouTube. Maybe he just needs to change up his videos. I would love a more vlog style take. He’s done it before. And I feel like it’s more engaging then just sitting in front of the cameras. Or maybe a Jeffrey star reality show would cool too. 😢 🤷‍♀️
i'd never thought of the impact the pandemic actually had on youtube, you'd expect people to watch it more since everyone was indoors but i can say myself that even i hardly watch it anymore...
We love that ur back and making videos the true ones never left❤🙌🏼
I personally don't like tik tok and i think it damages a lot of ppl. Specially younger ones. But in anyway to me shorts video on insta or tik tok was a thing a youtube another. Like sometimes i want a long video, with explanation or crazy content. To me it's for 2 different desire and i prefer youtube way more. And hearing that jeffree migth leave, even tho i didn't watch many of his video cause i am not into make up, it's sounds like the begging of the end of the platform, wish i hope not.
Shane, I am letting you know if you ever quit YouTube I will find you and force you to make videos.
No one watches YouTube “me watching YouTube” 👁️ 👁️ 😂🖤
Stupid Texas ??? 💀 Jeffery we don’t talk like that either here
It's the silencer for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only one who low-key wants to ship Chris and jeffere
I'm that person that lives off YouTube and can never get into these hyped up tv shows so Jeffree leaving is v sad 😭😭 first Jenna now this, if Shane and ryland ever  leave I'm done rip 🥹🥹
So true. I used to be on youtube all the time now I'm hardly ever on it. I only came back for these videos ahahah.
Jeffree ain't playing. He's locked and loaded and has a damn silencer. 2nd Ammendment who? AndnHurting our ears to protect ourselves can't relate 🤣 I love that he's doing other big stuff like farming. Farming is super important. If you know a farmer, thank a farmer.
2 million views and not a real comment in sight.
“Nobody’s watching” cut to #1 Trending on YouTube 😂❤❤❤
I care!!!!!
Bruh, I DONT HAVE TIKTOK. 🙃 But I do get what Jeffree is saying, hence the YT shorts because YT recognizes short content is the new thing. But YT is still superior due to monetization! OnlyJeffree doesn't exactly need the revenue from YT but a platform people consistently consume content, so Tiktok it is, ig.
JS is just a POS! Don't know why u still treat him as a friend. If u notice, NO ONE colaberate with JS! Also, he kills his own animal and sell. He let fame and money get ahead of him.
I'm literally cryinggggg i just miss it so so much
😭😭😭😭😭 I MISS THISSSSSSSS
Of course my 30 year old ass still hops on YouTube and watches this shit for enjoyment 😅
I'm surprised I can't find any negative comments 🤨
I love all you’re videos and I can say that you are not wasting your time making these videos. ❤
I'm kind of in love with this Wyoming version of Jeffree. He looks so so soooo good in a natural state. And I love that he always puts 100% into everything he does. Love!
Shane I have watched you since 2010 and I will WATCH you till my LAST BREATH. If you were to only have 1 fan remaining on this Earth then that would be me.
Im not shocked to hear Jeffree will be leaving I'm just sad
A fan since 2013 ❤️
I still love YouTube as I don't have tiktok and won't get it either. I do love a good haunting series
I will always support you Shane <3
That airport pick up was the most likable I’ve ever found Jeffree. He seemed like a non-pretentious, chill bestie from the neighborhood. I much prefer this version of him
Just jefree with a single TUFT of hair out-of-place makes me so happy for him becuz he seems actually comfortable for once n his on screen life. Also p.s. so cool that he's more open about carrying guns becuz his last video packing up the big house there was a bunch left out on the counter and he got kinda off about it (my opinion what I thought, he seemed kinda sketched that it was recorded at thebtime) and now he's so happy and lackadaisical he's like he'll yeah I shoot every morning! And is just living his life! Good for him honestly!!! Inner peace is PRICELESS!!!!!! ALSO IM SO HAPPY MADDIE IS BACK 🥲 I really felt she cared the lost for Jeffrey's personal health during the first collab pallete (I also felt nate did too but we aren't talking about that rn) and Maddie wasn't praised enough but I really feel she did sooooo much more work than she was given credit for and that's why she left and jefree FELT her absence and wanted her back... glad he sees true friends .. u don't need yes men around u jefree OR Shane or Ryland! Ur real friends r the ones who call u out unapologetically! Like rylands mom! She was dope
❤❤❤
“I love travelling… just not with Elton John” 😂😂
Ok y'all, I live in OK I can say that, I am truly enjoying this. I dipped out shortly BC, just because it was getting too materialistic. I loved the 1st Jeffery videos and that journey and I felt such pride of you 2 and the success of the pallets. I am happy to see y''all back and somewhat more down to earth. Having a healthy love and respect for life looks good on ya! In my best Granny voice... If I don't see a ghost hunting series from y'all...!!! Love and all the best from Oklahoma!! Be your best selves Darlings! 🥰
I will never subscribe to Tik Tok, & I watch YouTube daily. The only way I get Jeffree’s content & learn about his launches are through Youtube. Guess he doesn’t want me as a customer anymore
YouTube isn’t dead. People just don’t like Jeffree anymore because of the you done goofed shit that he never aknowledges.
Look I watch YouTube everyday and I always click both of yalls videos every upload app idk what jeffree is talking about
I want to know who the camera man is unless it was ryland. I couldn’t tell.
What a pointless video. An hour of nothing, what a waste of time
Hey Shane why don't you make a video exposing all the spammers in your comment section trying to scam your viewers ? I mean it's happening all over on all channels.
i love shane but let me just say jeffree’s humor has became immaculate. i love this era for them.
the way my computer just froze when Jeffrey said he's quitting.. i cannot handle hahahaha even the computer is shooketh
I really miss you. I haven’t laughed like this in a long time shane. I love you 🤍🥺.. also im a cancer too so you already know im crying.
OMG quitting youtube?!  I kinda seen this coming since everynight when I get on youtube I have my fingers crossed that Jeffree uploaded a new video and I never see one :(  I hate tiktok so didn't know thats where he was uploading, youtube is just so much better to show the make up.. and oh how I miss make up tutorials! People are def still watching youtube but whatever is best for you.
JEFREE should HONESTLY get into his own reality tv show?? I’d love that imma miss him being in YouTube. But onto better things and I’m fully here to support him. Watched him from the beginning and he’s so calm so happy ! 🥹 I love you babes keep it up ! Love from Texas
What is Jeffree talking about?! I love YouTube!!!!
I’m that nobody that gets excited to watch your videos. 🙋🏽‍♀️ I’ve missed you!!!! 😍🥰🥰
Makes me sad Jeffree feels like no one cares.  I love watching him and always have.  Especially when y’all are together.  Can’t wait for part 3!
This series is giving me full blown memories. I’m like having a moment right now 😮
happy to see maddy, i really like her 😊
I im feeling this new Jeffree.
Ryland “8 dogs” 😭
Shane “What made you pick Wyoming?” Jeffree “There’s no one here.” I felt that
Yeah I only go on YouTube for asmr videos when I go to sleep. The only exception is if Shane posts something 😊
Damn, it’s very true… I used to watch YouTube everyday. Now not so much but it’s really just because I’m busy AF.
Shane I’ve watched you since I was a kid. I’ve always loved you, if you decide to quit YouTube as well I’ll be sad but if it makes you happy that’s all that matters.
I’m cracking up at Jeffree talking about “gay culture” in Wyoming 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ive always been a fan of you both together, thank you for doing another series like this. Im old school so Im still here on YT. 😁 So nice to see you both again
Unpopular opinion but Jeffree is right about YouTube being done but unfortunately for him it's mainly done for his type of content and the old drama laden beauty community😶. The people who are still killing it on YouTube have adapted, either doing vulnerable everyday relatable type vlogs, or just being more sincere, showing podcasts or other long form content like streamers gaming, the lawtube popularity rise, or doing lives in general. It's the juxtaposition to over indulgence in quick short form vapid content that thrives on tiktok. Content of substance is more popular, I actually watch YouTube more now than I ever did before🤷‍♀️. Whether you love or hate Shane, he has a real talent for creating curiosity and creating an atmosphere you want to know more about in his videos like this.
Meh, I completely disagree on the YouTube thing. Maybe when you're super successful and rich already it's pointless, but it's still a GREAT avenue for people starting out and a wonderful long-form way to create for people. It's also still making plenty of people rich. Maybe not 200 million dollars rich, but a few million yes. I think people leaving YouTube for TikTok are making a massive mistake.
You and Jeffree are so much happier and more content with who you are and I fucking love it
I am living for this series. 🦄🦄♥️
I think people underestimate Jeffree. He’s extremely intelligent and has a great team behind him to get the ball rolling. He makes great business decisions. His land is a business, tax write off. He’s glam but also I see the humble side of him too. Very proud of what he’s done so far in his life.
Is it tomorrow yet? I'm already awaiting the finale with tissues😞💖💐
"No one talks like that here. I'm doing like a stupid Texas twang." Me, a Texan, watching: 🤠🤠
2.2 million people are watching you... youtube isn't dead, everyone is leaving youtube and that's making youtube dead :(
25:28 That sync was a nice touch
Omg I love watching you both!
proud to say that i’m still here watching in 2022 🤍✨
Ayooo lol they literally just finished talking about Jeffrey’s car accident. Then you see the fear in Shane’s eyes as he accelerates the speed of the car
Shane I hope you know I click on youtube I watch Coryxkenshin, you when you post, cody ko, HJ evelyn, sturniolo triplets, etc. WE ARE STILL HERE FOR WHEN YOU POST.
jeffree is right though no one gives a rats ass about youtube anymore, yes i was excited about this video and enjoyed it but i didn’t know it existed if i didn’t see clips on tiktok. youtube is just a waste of money now it’s sad but true
Oh man I will miss his you tube videos but I kinda figured it was going in that direction since he hasn't been posting much.
Why did you wash your hair for the thumbnail but not for the video? Seriously want to know.
What saddens me is that Jeffree’s going to quit, I now deeply realize how much I love Jeffree as a content creator thanks to his life choices and mistakes that we’ve all (might have) learned from, idk ofc there’s an end to everything but for Jeffree as a content creator hope it never got to that point.
I felt Ryland so much when he said “There’s nothing for me to see”.  Meeeeeee yooooo YouTube is different. I’m so sorry Jeff⭐️is no longer going to make YT.
Dang...the "no one watches youtube for fun" hit me hard.. I actually think I am the only person out of most that I know except for 1 other person that watches youtube ALOT lol.
This is my favorite version of jeffree ever! 😭 he looks so happy and free. I love Shane and Jeffree together, they’re like cousins.. like they haven’t seen each other in years but always pick up where they left off. They make each other the best versions of themselves. It’s so fun to watch.
Aww ryland outfit was such a slay so cute<3
Jeffree still looks great even without makeup on. His skin is absolutely glowing and he looks so healthy and happier ever since he moved to Wyoming. Plus his natural eyebrows that grew in look so refreshing and handsome. I’m glad he’s in a better place in life. A change can be good 😊 His videos are so inspiring, creative, quirky and funny to watch because he puts so much effort into his videos. All of them, and not just the makeup and palette reveal ones. 💜💖🪩 A truly crafted gem of a YouTuber. 💜💖🪩
Except for products launches.
I still care Jeffree! I've LOVED all your YouTubes. I have not gotten onto TikTok and didn't want to. But to see you? May be time to sign up 🤩 It makes my heart so happy to see how truly happy you are! Love from Napa Ca🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jeffrey says no one is watching..with a video 2.2 million views! 🤣 we love you both  ♥️ the energy is there for me. Jeffrey is so happy to be in Shane's presence.
"You just casually wear Gucci while you work out?"🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm literally ALWAYS on YouTube 🥺🥺 for some of us it will never die
yeah please don’t pan down
DO THE HAUNTED THING YAS PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE
You and Jeffree need to do a haunted video together!! I swear! 🔥🎉
Jeffrey Star should host his own Throwback Type Warped Tour Festival there! I saw him perform at Warped back in the day and him doing that would be soo full circle. I know Star’s got another album or 3 left in him. ❤
omg as soon as u started getting nervous shane i actually wanted to cry this journey has been so special with you and i’m so beyond words that you’ve had us along with you every step of the way ! x
I LOVE JEFFREY SOOO MUCH!!!
“i have a name so i’m fine” - shane 2022 referencing jefree slaughtering yaks that are only nameless 😂
Noo! Ima miss jeffree star 😢😔 I go way back to when he starts on Facebook and then become big on YouTube. He made me feel like I can be rich, but I haven’t done anything with my life meanwhile I seen him glow up 💕 I hope he comes back to YouTube once in a while or does a Netflix show
He’s not wrong. YouTube really does suck now
BYEE THE GLOCK WIT THE SILENCER😭😭✊🏽✊🏽
I miss them 2 together 😢❤
its like im just confused about how THIS was what he was "SOOO PROUD OF" and cant wait for his fans to see like..... what are they supposed to be seeing lol i really dont understand. genuinley what is there to be proud of like its just an hour long vlog..
Jeffree is right, this is really the first time I’ve really sat down and watched YouTube in years
Why didn't you give that sponsor in the summer time nobody is gonna use it during the winter
~ omgosh , star really still be rich i could never .
I love that Blucifer made a cameo. Damn that demon horse...lol.
did anyone else spot downtown Athens, Georgia being used as b-roll footage of Wyoming???? lmao 23:49
I am so happy that Jeffrey has you two as friends that sticks with him through thick and thin and despite not being in contact in a while, you are still in good terms. I'm happy you are making JS videos again 🥺
Lol me just now realizing jeffree says woooo after every reveal and it cracks me up 🤣🤣 everytime he comes out with something imma wait for the woooo
I'm so happy Jeffree has found peace and happiness away from a very hectic lifestyle. I am sad to see him go away from YouTube. I do spend my time more on TikTok, I think it helps ppl that have adhd that just want to watch a quick video. It'd be amazing if he made his own gun line, I'd buy. And most def he needs to do a paranormal video with you😂🫂Glad you guys got together and had some fun 🥰
so goooooooood
I have binge watched every shane and Jeffree video since this has come out. I need more Shane/Jeffree content!!!!!
SOOOOO a new pallet called canceled would be ICONIC!!!
I disagree with Jeffree saying that noone uses youtube for fun anymore! Or that people don't get views, honestly it just has to be the right kind of video and I would love some sort of Jeffree content but I'm not really bothered about purely makeup reviews anymore unless I guess I plan to buy the product
hi guys
YouTube does not suck! Shane and Ryland - I watch all of your videos!
I’ll be devastated if Jeffry leaves youtube. I only go on you you’ve for cheer videos and him. You give me life Jeffry. I’m coming out there with a blunt and we will talk about it
HAUNTED SERIES WITH JEFFREE NOWWWWWWWW LOL
can u offer one suggestion. i mean u probably dont even read these but babe? constantly asking jeffree how much this was or how much that etc is really bad manners. u just dont do that hun. its embarassing and shows  like its just inappropriate. tacky kinda. so yeah try babe
So glad Jeffree found his happiness in his life. Gonna miss him on YouTube.  😥
Shane please do some haunted content with Jefferee
shane i just want you to know that i would trust you with my entire life
the gun im DEAD 😂
I still like to watch YouTube because if I have to watch Netflix, HBO, Hulu etc its like a commitment I can't handle lolll....But all the content on YouTube has been sucking lately. except this. Its like rare like this video.
I'm sitting in Lander Wyoming watching this. When Jeffree talks about the non-existent gay culture, I laughed. It's too true. Also, I'm from Casper. I have to say, after learning the impact Jefree has had on my hometown, honestly, I'm thankful. He really is doing a lot for the town. So thank you, Jefree.
loved the video and just them talking about the ghost I can see a very cool video with them ghost hunting there! Now that would be an amazing and fun video.
Jefree just has a new glow 2him and looks so much better  and Shane well done 2u both
“My SOUL wants this NOW” -Jeffrey Star  This line gave me chills. He seems like he’s just growing so much. It’s refreshing to see him in this light.
If Shane and Jeffrey made a haunted series I would literally never stop watching it!
I watched Jeffree for so many years - and was NEVER offended by his words or actions until today.  “Stupid Texan” and “nobody” watches hurt me.     Im probably just premenstrual and overreacting.  So I’ll keep watching but yeah I was a little hurt.
I love this series so far. It's the best one. I can't wait to see part 3. 😁😍😁😍  I love you, Shane. Never stop doing what you love to do. You are awesome. Okay. 🥰🥰🥰💕💕💕
Can you bring Jenna Marbles back too please? My wife would really appreciate it! Thank you!
go away
Jeffree is so inspiring
Literally no, everyone still loves YouTube
So sad jeffree is leaving YouTube! 😢💔🥺
YouTube ads have massively let the platform down😢 I much prefer to use tiktok… I least I can scroll the ad away
I’m so happy you’re back making a series!!! I love the Shane and Jeffree duo ❤
I love Jeffree but lets be real.. 1 million + views each video is not dead, yes it might not be 33mil but thats far from dead and a big over exaggeration 🤣
I love you guys before after cancellation lol <3
I’m here, watching!!  YouTube gives a connection to creators that a 60 second to 3 minute clip can’t.  I plan on hanging and waiting for the “return” of YouTube…..
I knew you would make a comeback 😍 so glad to have you & Jeff back!!
I missed them so much
17:16 that lady in the back 😂
Insane how much the viewership on y’all’s videos has dropped. Gone from 20-50m views per video to 2m
I just love Jeffrey Star he’s so funny
Ghost hunting with Jeffree😱
Jeffree casually pulling up an gun x'D
Awe don’t quit YouTube! So many people still care and watch! I still watch YouTube religiously!
Shane should do a series about himself entitled — Is My Youtube Channel Dying?  Like what he did before.  Since haters and bashers said that he’s very calculated and intelligent, we will see it in full view and I’m always here for it. 😂🎉
Shaneeeee please go look at my new tattoo lol it's so youuuuu, please 👀🖤 it has the breakdown glasses, and a blended dutch bros 🥰🥰 I tagged your podcast on IG
No please Jeffrey
Tbf I'm only watching Shane for Jeffree
Honestly I think Jeffree is 100% wrong.   Youtube isn't less popular. YouTube is still popular and YouTubers still get millions per episode.  I think the problem is that people aren't really interested in Jeffree anymore. Unfortunately the same for Ryland and Shane too.   I think it is okay for Jeffree to retire, that is 100% fine cause Jeffree doesn't really need YouTube he'll done fine without it. But it is kinda sad that Jeffree is making up excuses on why people aren't watching their content anymore. I think they know why it isn't as popular, but they refuse to acknowledge it and because they refuse to acknowledge it it will never be the same as it was.  It is a shame that this is the way it is. Hopefully Shane does a full 180, cause I miss his content. Now Unfortunately it just seems like he is making content because he has to, rather than because he wants to.
i still love youtube!! i enjoy long form content and all of the OG creators!! i hate tik tok and how everything is so short now a days😭 Make youtube great again😭
The 0-60 took me all the way out, I’ve miss you guys😂❤
I love jeffree and his humour honestly 😂
Jeffree just deserves to be happy. And so do you and Ryland. 🤍🤍🤍✨️✨️✨️
Who remembers that time Jeffrey said no one watches YouTube and Shane has 2.2million views and counting lol I LOVE THEM and am here for it 🙌🏽💕 I LOVE this new Jeffree!!!!!
The end of the video made me so sad.. He's right though. 2-3 years ago I was on YouTube ALL the time. It seems like no one makes interesting/fun videos anymore and that's why it died. Tiktok has completely took over all social media platforms. No matter what though if I see that one of my favorite YouTubers post I'm watching it asap! 🥰 So excited they are back together and making one last series together ❤ You all deserve happiness and I'm happy you all are finding it somehow 🥺
Hello I still watch YouTube 🥺🤣🤣
I bet the palette will be called Cancelled or Cancellation haha
Well it sucks he says no ones watching and youtube sucks n blah but here we are no one, watching.
The fact that jeffrey has a silencer on his gun is giving lmfaooooooooo jeffree wick
Jeffree is really really smart. He is making amazing moves towards happiness and success. It is so great to see all of you finding happiness
I love jeffree sm
Loved the video! Perfect for a snowy day and chores around the house 😎
YouTube is a prison lol
Your wrong Jeffrey, there’s MANY of us that I know that all still come home and watch videos on YouTube. I will miss you and I cate!
I lost it when he pulled the gun out to show Shane 😂
Jeffree is glowing in this
I love you guys... but....guns?? nope. please.
I still watch yt daily. But I'm also a dinosaur Era gal myself but daughter who is 9 does as well so there's 2 ppl lol drop in the bucket but I felt the urge to share it
Am I the only one still obsessed with YouTube? I watch a lot of TikTok every day, then binge a couple times a week over here. I don’t see YouTube going the way of MySpace or Vine. It’s the OG. I see a comeback on the horizon.
These two together again is the best
❤️❤️❤️
I have to disagree with jeffree - I still watch YouTube regularly and very rarely Netflix. I also don’t use tiktok, I much prefer long form content like YouTube and podcasts 🤷‍♀️
Why are we allowing him to be on YouTube again?
What if he’s actually lying and he planned this all and everybody’s just playing along
so happy that Jeffrey looks more relaxed and himself now :)
Omg the last line about Jenna 😭
Okay but first thoughts on this new Jeffree.. I starting to like him again
Honestly he has a point. I hardly ever watch youtube anymore. Feels like it is starting to die out
THIS is the content we needed thank you for the closure❤️
where is the conspiracy videos !!!!!!
Nah youtube is still my jam
i care!!!!!
I love how JEFFERY is against their and them.. if your a boy your a he if your born a girl your a her of you have an operation you are He or she.. there is no their and them.. Be real! If not then im a queen and wish to be addressed as queen! Love the honesty!
What did Jeffree say at 30:48 ?
You’re going to tell me you’re not going to sell the pallet? You didn’t make this video to show people this mystery pallet? You aren’t in this for a money grab?
Jeffrey sounds like such a bro in his car
Youtubers boasting about their money. Yep. Just what the young people need to hear
All I know - is I miss the old Jeffree content.   YT is far from dead - it’s just different.   I use it daily.   I don’t use tiktok.  I was mad at him.   This series makes me less mad.   I loved his tutorials.   His approved videos.   I trusted his opinion - and wanted it.   Here’s to hoping he will be back with more LONG FORM content.  ❤
it’s cool to see he confirmed the pallet is called canceled
I love youtube. Watch it every day. I dont have tik tok. Dont want it either.
yessss ive been wanting more of you guyssss!!!!!!!!!❤🤍
***** NO SHANES WERE HURT WHILE FILMING THIS VIDEO 🤣😂🤣 And can I say how much I appreciate Jeffree’s pure rawness. He has such a natural beauty, I mean obviously he’s fabulous when glammed, but his naturalness is game.
As much as I love tiktok for funny videos and cute animals- I prefer long form like YouTube for makeup and vlogs and whatnot. I always look forward to Jeffree’s videos. It’s such a bummer it’s not worth it for him anymore 😞
If Jeffree REALLY likes seclusion and quiet, he should visit the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. I grew up in the UP. There's only 301,000 in the Upper Peninsula. Most people don't know that Michigan has two parts.
Calling all of us watching him on youtube ‘nobody’. I literally come here for Jeffree and Shane. But I get it, I do
Jeffree looks so healthy, radiant and handsome like never before. Your skin is glowing, bitch!!!
i love youtube !! please dont leave shane
I remember the cremated cus he posted it on my birthday nd i wanted it 😩
Was I ready for that announcement? Never. It made me profoundly sad. I remember coming back from university or work and literally getting on YouTube on their channels. It just made me so so sad.
Shane was a real friend to Jeffree and JS didn’t leave him behind. JS weathered all the storms and stayed strong and resilient. Then when it was safe again, he’s providing Shane an avenue to return. Shane is no saint but sometimes cancel culture is just ridiculous. There are people that deserves to be canceled, but others just needs another chance.
YouTube is still a big part of what I watch. I watch Shane, Ryland and Morgan’s content as it comes out. I watch other moms, cleaning content..like I’m a new mom to a toddler! I relate to these people and it’s nice to have that sense of community.  Shane for the love of creation…please don’t quit YouTube. I understand where Jeffrey is at..he’s in a place in his life where he doesn’t need the spotlight anymore. He tried so hard for so long to get acceptance and prove himself to the haters from his youth..  but YouTube has been your creative space…whether people understood/understand your humor or not, you still have a lot of us who do and we love you. I’ve been here since I was a young teen in 2005 and I’m 31 now. I still eat up your content and thoroughly enjoy your humor.   Much love from the Colorado western slope!  Side note - were you guys in Grand Junction over the weekend 11/12/22? A black G wagon went down main and I’ve never seen one here!  I know you guys come here sometimes…I hope I can meet you some day!
I hope not ...YT is the only way I get to see Jeffree because I'm not interested in tiktok
I feel like Jeffree finally had the character arc we've been waiting for. It seems like he really is a better person now he has found something that adds to his life, that isn't just objects.
Wyoming Jeffree though ..
I love YouTube. It’s the first place I go to when I want to watch makeup content or something other than movies or tv shows. It makes me sad that Jeffree thinks it’s dying. They need to do a paranormal series. Please. I’m begging.
I loved the episode! I loved how we got to see both you and Jeffree behind the scenes, stripped down, vulnerable and no masks on. You both look so happy and humbled! Jeffree has become a whole different person he says he found peace and I find that believable! Moving out of California was the best decision for BOTH of you! I'm so excited for the upcoming episodes and I can't wait to see the pallete!
Jeffree and Shane should release the " cancelled " palette that would be so dope and call it cancelled!!! Lol
Me, slowly trying to grow a YouYube channel * Jeffree : YouTube sucks!
Sturdy camera footage please. It’s so shaky. Does it give anyone motion sickness
I AM HERE FOR THIS AGE OF JEFFREE!!! Love the guns, the land, the humility-ish, no Birkins, everything 🥰🥰🥰
YouTube is my go to app. I don’t have tik tok or twitter or paramount or whatever kids are into now days. YouTube is my go to I watch it religiously. Most people I know who are my age watch YouTube religiously.
His lips look SOO good ! He looks and sounds a lot more relaxed
I have been following Jeffree star since he was a MySpace queen. I still loved him even when these hoes were trying to cancel him. It’s sad that he’s leaving YouTube cause I hate tik tok. I’m high and my sad comment is all over the place. I love you jeffree. Shane I live in Denver. Hit me up in 30 years old lol we can hang out be old together. Ryland can come I’ll bring my wife cause I’m gay but have no friends rip.
This was refreshing to see that even crazy rich people need to find balance and downsize every now and then.
Jeffree still gets over a million views on his videos! I watch for enjoyment! I wish he would read more hate comments in asmr
Wowwwww Jeffree is open to ghost hunting 😍 let’s all hope that it really happens and we will all get to see them exploring different haunted places together in Wyoming!
Stay away from him.
Soooooo full disclosure I didn't know you were cancelled via Jeffree... I still use the conspirasy pallent daily when I get ready to stream on twitch. It's just an easy go to for me. Much love and hope you all are doing well!
Nooooo. I feel soo old. We lost MySpace and then Vine and now Youtube?!? My whole childhood bro!
He has a good point, I hardly watch YouTube anymore, very rarely. Even this video I’m 5 days late and views are not as high as they once were
But I watch YouTube 😢
Idk what’s more amazing that I live in the state of Colorado with Shane dawson or that Jeffery is just a state away now Lmao
i am only on youtube or facebook
Your cameraman was double masking on the plane 🤡😂😂
I see 2.1 million people came to YouTube and clicked on this video so I feel like that's not awful numbers considering there are other services available to watch. (Not for free though.) I understand leaving what's no longer enjoyable behind but he'll be missed by this who did watch his channel.
This makes me so sad to know Jeffree wont be making videos anymore. I watch youtube daily...Its really gonna miss seeing Jeffree on youtube. I really hope u and Ryland dont stop now!
I literally spend hours on YouTube every day. I rather watch my favorite youtubers it brings me joy.
okay no but Jefree is looking super handsome????????????????
Yeah man I’m super bummed. Just because you are not getting 5 millions plus views anymore, doesn’t mean “no one is watching.” I literally can not wait for you to release your videos. I literally look forward to it, to you! Don’t leave us aliens that never left you!
Shane where is the next video I’ve been checking every day
Jeffree is just BEYOND.   Love him.
I miss Jeffree's reviews and always will! He was the main reason I watched YouTube 💔
I see Jeffree's point about YouTube to an extent, but like so many others are saying....I STILL love YT. Tiktok just doesn't do it for me. I need my 45 min docu style videos...it's my escape 😔
Nooooooo Jeffrey don't stop YouTube i love watching your videos
I recommend going to Jackson Hole Wyoming it’s awesome and I’m sure you would love it. You could possibly ghost hunt there maybe in not sure
Honestly I love yalls friendship.
Jeffee looks so healthy & his eye brows are amazing 👏 😍
YouTube and the small group of influencers I follow still spark joy for me, I come here as an escape. I don’t watch TikTok’s and I hope guy all stay!
Youtube is at a weird state right now
Seeing the growth and happiness in Jeffree now makes me even more proud of him.  *THIS* is what he deserved for so long 💖 *EDIT* ...OK, a little more than halfway in and I just had to come back and say this...Jeffree is so much more relaxed and seems genuinely happy now. So glad he's finally finding inner peace.
❤❤❤❤❤
I've been on YouTube forever and I always watch it when I get done with anything it's my go to and I always watch Shane and Jeffree y'all are my comfort people when I'm down , I love everything you do
For me YouTube is everything, I watch it just for fun everyday. I don’t care at all about stupid TikTok and I never touch it. Instagram and YouTube only for me. I really hope Jeffree keeps doing collection reveals on YouTube, I hope he doesn’t quit YouTube 100%.
I do only go to YouTube for Shane videos now
I'm loving this series, it's so brilliant to see and feel the energy of these two again. I wish they would release the palette.
okay but i watch youtube every day, i don’t like the short tiktok content. i love youtube, like i don’t turn on netflix when i get home, i turn on youtube 😂i don’t think youtube is dying, i think the makeup community just died.
Also idk what Jeffree is talking about because I watch YouTube every single night before I sleep
Y'all should do a haunted series together it whould be everything
I’m so happy for Jeffree to finally get peace and growth but it’s kind of bittersweet. I’ve been following him since MySpace like yes TikTok but I love watching these series and videos.  It’s like an end of a really good book💕
36:55 jeffree reactions so attractive sometimes
Don’t listen To him ryan YouTube isn’t dead Jeffree is. Nobody cares anymore what he does.
It sucks that you're quitting YouTube because I watch every single video you have pretty much put out since 2013. For 10 years now I've supported you and I will continue no matter what that endeavor means. I guess I'll have to download tiktok again. I hope you post fun tutorials on tiktok because I trusted your word the most especially when you tried drugstore makeup. Absolutely love the series!!
I NEED this pallet 😭😭
i live for his makeup reveals and reviews and I was never into makeup until I started watching him and honestly I'm still not a big make up person but at least now I get it and I see what good makeup looks like and it's worth it but so glad he's so happy that's what really matters
I watch youtube for enjoyment
the ending upset me so much. “who cares?! no one watches youtube, no one likes youtube” ME. And BILLIONS of other users!!!! Youtube is a saving grace and always has been. I’m still watching just as many beauty videos as I used to - it’s the PEOPLE I invest in, not just the content. Not to mention, youtube is the only free long-form content app/website that we have. Most people across the world can’t afford all these streaming services etc. thank god for youtube. Long may it continue! And long may creators thrive on it.   Ryan trahan had a huge series this year! Mr beast is smashing it. Cooking shows are huge. Music videos, art, history, sports, news, tech, etc!!!!
Please dont stop making videos- people DO still watch YouTube
I think Jeffree has had a coming of age. Material things don't = happiness that said all I want in life is a bungalow (I'm disabled) and a dog. I work part time but it still feels so far away. If I had those two things I'd cry my eyes out x
Ryland’s hair looks GREAT!
I LOVED watching Ryland smile at Jeffery in adoration and love in the kitchen 😭 So sweet. I love seeing this side of Jeffery, too. It’s so humanizing- he seems so humble and appreciative. Love y’all! Cant wait to see more 🎉
No i will always watch shane and rylands youtube it does bring me joy
I mean i still watch youtube but everyone good is gone.
When Jeffrey says YT is dead, he means for his content. He did all he can for clicks and he doesn't have anything left. Sadly, his mindset only centers on HIS personal experience that's why he has an empty house. Shane may or may not still have things to offer YT. This is interesting content but won't be a job forever for Shane.
Just because Jeffree is done does not mean you hang the hat up too Shane!
It's such a nice feeling knowing that after everything shane and Jeffery went through, that they are still have a strong bond and friendship!! Most of everyone they knew bashed them online to get a view. I just love them together and their friendship!! 💜💗
Omgeee Shane I missed you
J quitting YouTube because “no one warches” baby, people still watch, they’re just over you and your drama. What a little baby. He doesn’t even get barely any views on tik either so. It’s YOU not the platforms
No. Youtube is not dead. Its his channel.
I still love and enjoy YouTube 😅
the part where Jeffree says "it feels so right, because its with you."  gave me chills
i fuckin love this i wanna be y’all’s friends 😭
idk if yall noticed but when Jeffree was talking about how youtube sucks now, Shane's face was kind of hurt in a way. Like he realized that something he has been doing for YEARS and loved could potentially be ending. So i feel like that kind of got him thinking about what he should do next. I mean he even started posting tiktok videos recently too so hes probably taking Jeffrees advice. Idk just a thought
I really love deglam'd Jeffree.
Aww I love it. Welcome to country living. Born and raised I couldn’t imagine living in a big city on top of each other.
That’s my dream too, to have a urinal lol
I’m still watching! ❤ I am so excited about the new series!! YouTube is my favorite thing! Jeffree I’ll still watch you. I may not be the world but you still matter to some of us!! Thank you so much Shane for filming this!! I laughed so much watching you all together again like old times ❤Keep the content coming!! I’m still here!! ❤
Love this Video so much !!!!!!
Noooooooo!!!!! Jeffrey don’t leave YouTube!!!!!! Please. No! I’m sad.
Wow Jeffrey seems so together.  Peaceful!
I'm still watching! The ending made me sad. A haunted video would be so great!
You know a lot of people are probably not happy about the guns. I’m Appalachian ,guns are just a thing  and there is such a thing as responsible gun use
I dont watch YouTube as much as I used to. But only because it's all been done before. There's nothing new. These series are really refreshing but the makeup reviews etc is just boring and you can view those on TikTok which get to the point and are shorter videos!
Gotta love Jeffree 😂
I feel like Jeffree was finally freed by the cancellation on you tube and social media. Sometimes we fear what is truly in our best interest for personal growth and development. I’m so glad to see him so healthy and happy.
the slut and the slutier , fakeness level God
"this feels like rehab" that should really make one reflect.
He's looking good. He's looking good in the face and eyes, more healthy.
JS, YouTube is not Myspace.
Cringe
So sad because I love YouTube. I don’t have TikTok. I’m going to be sad when Jeffree stops because I’ve been watching since the beginning and I’m so so proud of where he is in life rn. I feel lucky to be able to be Along for the journey. I’m rooting for you
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS
Oh! And Ryland, if you ever want to get rid of your LV white multicolor bag, I’d love to have it♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🌸😊
Hello Shane, Ryland and family! I’m 62, and my name is Vickie too! I adore you and your amazing family and I am so excited to see your baby when the time comes🙏🏻🕊🌸♥️
Maybe it's because I've been watching YouTube since 2007, but I know a lot of people who watch plenty on here
The fact the Beretta was cocked had me nervous
wow
Noones editing skills compare 🙌🏽
L
Does anyone agree that Shane needs to do a video with Marina Joyce like what happened.
Great end of the video ❤ i don’t want YouTube to die lol. But maybe I’m just an old MySpace dinosaur ✌🏾😂
Loooove Shane and Ryland adventures. Absolutely brings joy watching their love and passion. Xx
I'll be so sad if we don't get any spooky jeffree videos lol pleaseeeeee shaneeee lol
Ok. I just came back on this app after figuring my life out post pandemic and what I learnt - YouTube isn’t the same place  - big YouTubers have moved on and not creating content anymore  -tiktok is not just tiktok  - people rather binge series than keep up with youtuber content… or want short brainless content   What is going on 😂 YouTube was everyday!
Just saying, going shooting with Jeffrey out on open land, just targets, would be epic. Could also bring out my compound bow and just have fun shooting and drinking Starbucks. I am a weird girl but a purple bedazzled gun would be so 😎 cool. 😂
I think you and Jeffree should do a reunion show EVERY year!!  Love the energy with you guys so much.
Shane Dawson is so fucking hot.
I do have to say I’m 25 now and grew up on YouTube. I have to say when I get home from work or on my lunch break at work it was always YouTube but these days as Jeffrey said people just don’t anymore there is just way to many platforms and it’s really sad to see another generation of videos just slowly disappear:(
Okay yeah now I know that a haunted paranormal series would be Epic. But for Jeffree to just quit YouTube. NO WAY!!!! I love her she's amazing and beyond Stellar. She's a Goddess and she must stay. Otherwise I'm gonna go bat shit crazy. She keeps me sane with her makeup, skin care, beautiful dogs, amazing yaks and Star Ranch. She just simply can't go away.❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
It breaks my heart that Jeffree's leaving YouTube. I'm in my early 60's and YouTube is the only thing I watch. Don't have Instagram or ever looked at Tik Tok.  I will miss him so much.
“No one opens YouTube anymore.” ME LITERALLY WATCHING 5 videos a day on here. Also, Shane’s face when Jeffrey pulled out the hand gün & silencer. I lost it! It was just the most innocent thing I’ve ever seen. 🥰
His land is like a creative Minecraft world lol time to build 100 buildings
Uhmmm. ... Jeffree, Can I come live with you? I'll be happy to stay in the barn or the arcade. 😆🙂❤️
I literally cried when jeffree said he was quitting Youtube 😥 i'll follow his content wherever it goes if is Tik tok now i'll be there but I really enjoy watching everything he does on Youtube!  Shane and Jeffree are my favorite Youtubers 😍  A hunted series in Wyoming with Jeffree is a must THAT WILL DEFINITELY BE TRENDING!👻👻👻👻👻👻
I don't Tik Tok. I watch a lot of YouTube. I learn about Jeffree Star Cosmetics launches through YouTube. I get it, I'm in the minority...but sad to see you go. Ryland and Shane, please DON'T leave YouTube!!!
I love you guys.  Faithful fan
Wonderful to see you guys together again! I've missed all of you! I sense the growth in each of you and it feels so good - so right. Onward and upward! Yaks forever!
Awe This New's Literally Break's my Heart, Jeffrey leaving U-tube that's Horrible !!! I absolutely ❤LOVE Him & You soooo much & LOVE His u-tube Video's , it's the saddest thing ever...But I do want Him & You & Ryland too be immensely Happy and if that's what He need's too be Happy , then so be it !!!! I just Hope , He stay's on some Social Platform so we can Follow him...💙Love you ⭐Jeffrey Star⭐ !!! OMG I cannot Wait for You & Jeffrey's New Make-up Pallet ,  I'm sooooo Freaking Excited !! Congratulation's Shane & Jeffrey , I Pray it's a Huge Success..!!!!! 💖Love you , Shane & Ryland and Chris & Jeffrey and Diva & Diamond , Delicious and all the Beautiful pomeranian's...
stop with the loud background music it’s awful
Wait jeffree YouTube was everything with you.
The gun in the video was so unnecessary
FINALLY THANK YOU JESUS
I’m so glad you’re liking Wyoming. :3 I moved out here to riverton in 2017 to fix my mental health and it has made my life so full. I hope to meet you one day and chat about your experience here so far! 🖤🖤🖤
I actually still watch YouTube. 🙏🏻
You know… I would love if Jeffree lauched dog food, I’m in a serch of a good dog food, and I absolutely would trust Jeffree and his yaks with this thing. 😁
I still watch YouTube all the time
Shane is so dramatic lol
The way Jeffrey said yes you can to Chris wanting to pet that yaks sounded like he was a sugar daddy making a persons dreams come true lmao
Jeffree needs some trees! ;) And Jeffree we still care.
I don't use any other media outlet. I enjoy long content. It definitely sucks more people don't feel this way. Like I have Twitter, insta, FB but I literally don't use any of it. I come to YouTube.
Conspiracy Theories are what will help you break the internet again Shane
Why am I crying right now
Shane honey, you were NEVER canceled in my eyes. Your or Jeffree. Love y’all and can’t wait for part 2&3. Jeffree, I love your soul and how humble you have become. Xxoo
IM SCREAMING AT SHANE TRYING TO HOLD THE GUN😂😂
tbh yes… youtube is dead 😢 sad but true, i think it’s dead for entertainment… people prefer tiktok and short content
Conspiracy against airport baggage
Tbh Jeffree is just petty he's been cancelled, YouTube still has a lot offer, it's simply the quality of the content that is lacking
Please hunted houses with Jeffrey. You could do a pallette called "hunted" or "deceased". Merchandise the pig backpack red and black outfits and who knows what else. It will be amazing if you guys do that.
This might be an unpopular opinion but this is the most likeable jeffree i have ever seen. I always enjoyed the shane/jeffree content but every now and then i would be like "ugh i cant stand jeffree sometimes" it seemed like he would feed off drama for attention,  or try to play this over the top character for attention and it always rubbed me the wrong way. But this jeffree, I like. Happiness looks good on you Jeffree! I relate to it it seems like none of the other crap matters to him anymore and he just seems like the most real relatable version of himself and I enjoy watching it! 💚 and we love shane as always 😂
I still watch for entertainment 🥹
I love you both!!! More content together and I don’t want Jeffery to leave YouTube!! I haven’t watched for awhile, but they are bringing me back. It’s been on my tv all day with these two. Love you guys❤
Thank you for the videos keep ‘em coming please I love your YouTube videos
Nooooo Shane u have too convence her not to I look forward to watching pallet reviews....my 9year old loves watching him...she sits in her room and pretends to do videos...all I hear is "WATS SUP EVERY BODY WELCOME BAK TO MY  CHANNEL!!!! HI HOW ARE YA!!!" I am so saddened... Jeffrey star is my biggest inspiration the person I sat down and watched every day all day and taught me how to do my make up!!!! My biggest dream is to meet him and of course u..and sit down and just spend the day in products and shadow😭😭 I don't have any other social media..how will I watch tutorials and revels 😭😭 I love u Jeffrey starr
I still love YouTube 🥺
Ask jeffrey if he’ll adopt me. I bark
it never disappoint us ngl best duo 👌🥰
Maybe it’s cuz I’m an old school social media girl but I haven’t connected to TT like I do with YouTube.
Tbh I’m only liking this video for Jefree Lynn
die hard fan for both of you guys forever <3 no matter what ily
Oh my gosh I am so happy for Jeffree ❤ and his beautiful new look at life!  So happy for you Jeffree 💗
Jeffree, Shane & Ryland, and Maddie are all so adorable!
i watch youtube all the time 🤷🏼‍♀️
idk what the ending was about talking about no one uses youtube ironic when the camera that filmed you saying that got 2.1m
I hope this doesn't mean Shane quits YouTube. Because he's the only reason I come on youtube!
13:41 That look reminds me of the look you’d give your then childhood friend, when they would get upset they got an ”A” and not an ”A+”, while you stood next to them and hadn’t passed at all.
I love this new Jeffery, they definitely have grown. I would love to live somewhere like this,feels super toasty and warm. If Jeffery showed how he decorated for Christmas (if they decorated) I’d click so fast. 🎄
Personally, Jeffree is such a great friend. He feels like my friend. He is someone that Shane needs in his life, and I'm so happy for you Shane to have this friendship. Jeffree deserves the low key life. I haven't been on YouTube forever but I sat and watched all of these videos and made time. I'm proud of ya'll.
Omg loved it! Thank you for sharing your journeys with us and taking us along. And honestly Jeffrey is right... YouTube days are almost over. But we will go wherever you go. We just love you guys so much! Sending you the best vibes on your journey in life! ❤️💯
Shane should stop overacting , its so cringe 😬 , even jefree' s yak acts better
Is Jeffrey forreal he gets a million+ views on a bad day
I love it - Jeffree's legit got a rap: "my hair's gelled back / I'm performing tiktoks with yaks"
I was 9 when I became a fan. All started with you honking ur horn
We still love YouTube 😭
Yeah baby … well maybe baby …  Am I ok baby?   I mean, I’ve always been pretrend (ie. so prior to trend that I was pretrend never just ontrend) & Jeffrey’s closing statement completely annihilated that self belief in less than 2 mins …  Thanks Jeffrey. Loved it Shane - the whole time I was on tenterhooks while @ the same time totally invested (u no - zoned out floating in a medium running clean as animal free rock free sandy bottom creek - the journey was encompassing.   You ARE YouTube - plus if you have to jump ship and go to another platform - you’re up for it BUT I DI NIT THINK TIC TOK IS IT! It’s run by China which means Government control. I dunno dude?? Jeffrey has the dosh & loves biz ideas biz ventures & You have the nounce, the editing skills, the on screen likeability - people WANT to root for you - just play the vulnerability card occasionally.  Girls still love you and you are still funny. Come up with a new platform (has the functionality of you tube to show long form content while also the option to do Tic Tok like stuff - call it with already contracted major partners - like boring old Apple maybe - this new platform is on the device from brand new - it’s part of their basic programme pack. I know - Apple Is almost old fashioned now but there isn’t another choice as yet.   BRICK (as in building something - a biz - a group - a social media presence) & yes followed by a second word also starting with B & sounding like brick but that takes thinking and it’s late … BRICK TRICK? Too cumbersome too pedestrian - lose the Brick.   FLICK?  Girls doing a flick with fingers closeup wearing bikinis ??
Jeffree Star needs a makeup pallette inspired by his bold choice in cars. Car girls need shades too, especially to match their unique car wraps and paint codes and nobody's touching that market. I have some ideas👀
Haunted series with Jeffrey!! Omg yessss I miss all the haunted videos!
The music is awful
Its creators like you two who helped destroy this platform.  It's nice now that the dust is settling and people are abandoning the ship you guys set alight, ye can sit back and say "ah such a Shame YouTube is dead" yer a disgrace.  Everything ye produce how yer fans act the toxic communities built Round these personalities.  Get gone so this platform can start healing.
This was incredible-missed seeing you guys together!!
I literally watch YouTube 3 hours a day. I much prefer it to the other apps
why are ya’ll just being cool with shane being back after all that shit with him being a p3do came out? absolutely not
Just stop. All the documentaries are circulating around the same theme: Jefferee Star, his gay ass, Shane's gay ass and his gay life
Okay but that second palette really did look fire... 😶
It's. Been a long time since I've seen such a long video and didn't skip 😂
“isn’t that stunning” -jeffree when he guns it down the country road
Me: there is nothing that can bring sadness to this beautiful sunny day Youtube: Jeffree Star is quitting youtube. Sun: Um..ok..soo..I'm like gonna go... Me: ☠️
I'm not going to lie I really miss this series and I am very excited to know what's next..
this video had more flashbacks than a naruto episode
YAAAKK QUEEN! 😂
PLEASE DON'T GO AWAY JEFREE!!
ngl I first thought he just lost all his money then he showed off the car and his gate opening upwards and I was at a loss of words 😂 so glad to see you two together again 🥺🕺🏼
Does he have any plans to do anything with all the money? Like help people ?
ok but what is the song in the intro
Watching shane and jefree star doing series again love that. I still b watching yoy tube videos i just dont watch makeup videos anymore. Shane got cancelled temporary but hes bk on lik nothing still getting millions of views on his you tube videos there always so funny and keep me entertained. Shane only gt canceled temporarily...
Jeffree is comolitely different person now. Wow. Much better version of himself. Wow wow wow... He now Understand that having milions Clothes and all is not everything. Very smooth to watch ❤🥰love it.
tbh I never was a fan of jeffree cause I always thought he is too much of a person. But today I think he is such a great person. not too much anymore and I just love how he did his thing with the yak ranch. :)
I love this version of Jeffrey. He seems so much more humble and happy. I think he needed to be 'cancelled' to be able to find himself.  Don't get me wrong he deserves what he has for all the hard work he has put in but I think he needed to be presented with an opportunity to step back and reevaluate and the last couple of years have been just that x
Shane, I like you. This is from a good place. Please keep the camera sturdy!!!!!!!!! Too much zoom in zoom out makes watching unpleasant ( you might think it makes watching unique but NO) , keeps the camera as sturdy as possible when on movement, it will make watching more enjoyable. X
Please don't leave YouTube JS. I miss seeing you on YouTube
I Will be so sad if all we’ll have in the near future is short TikToks… I like the longer videos on YouTube.
I cant help but feel frustrated with Jeffree becoming a 'farmer'. What I loved about his brand was it was one of the first to be completely Vegan & Cruelty Free & I know he wasn't himself but I bought into thinking he cared about animal life, with how much he loved his dogs.   I find it really uncomfortable to watch this with him joking about the money he is making from the Yaks meat, it's really upsetting. Jeffree claims he's changed & lives a more peaceful life but how can you have a clear conscious making money off of killing animals? He doesn't need anymore money???   The point I'm trying to make is its exploitation - using these animals as content but then having them slaughtered to further make money. I hope Shane or Jeffree see this & see how fucked up it is. Keep the Yaks & care for them, rescue other animals FROM slaughter.  Jeffee says he sold all his bags because that didn't bring him joy anymore... what so killing animals does now?
I still care about you tube and can't wait to see if yall have a new one to watch. I keep waiting on jefrees and get so excited when he does.  I know plenty of people that still love you tube. I would hate to see Jefree go. So sad!!!!!!
The emotional glow up from Jeffree is so refreshing
This was to watch!
I luv watching u all and Jeffery together.. he seems content, happy even. He seems to be over LA and all the bs good to see him happy after all the ups n downs
Jefree Stars License plate viewed by 3 millions people 😅
The really reason he quit yt was cause morphie drop like an old hagg, Now he's going brokeeee.🤣😂🤣😂
Imagine Jeffrey like, "Stop, where'd you park your plane?"
I missed y'all together like that! I'm so happy.🥹
That truck was so efin cool
Shane and Jeffree were always there during my suicidal teen years, during my religious trauma forming years… y’all helped me understand the gay side of me was ok, I watched y’all while dissociating during my first marriage, and still now during my spiritual awakening… life is getting fucking real. We need real creators like y’all on YouTube. I’m still here , needing y’all.  I love y’all.
Anyone that want to see paranormal videos Check out Ghost Theory and Quija  Brothers.  Stop telling Shane yo make ghost videos. He doesn't care.
When Jeffrey pulled that gun out I was like 😮 and then 😂😂😂😂
i don’t even remember why shane got canceled
YouTube does suck now.
Its interesting to hear Jeffree talk about how no one watches YouTube anymore. I actually choose to watch YouTube over Netflex, Disney or anything like that because YouTube is more personalised to the things I like to watch.  Also, please do Ghost Hunting with Jeffree. I want to see how Jeffree handles reacts to the Paranormal and would be great to get his first paranormal encounter on Camera.
I don’t watch YouTube other than to watch Shane, Ryland And jeffree honestly
to be fair I watch more Youtube now than I ever have in the past. I probably watch it more than any other streaming plattform but I am happy to see Jeffrey evolving!
Noooo he’s quitting YouTube ☹️
shane never fails.. there's always something about his series
It was great to revisit the past and to look forward to the future. I love you guys, as a community we love you guys. You will never be cancelled. I love your content. Just do that and don't worry about the reactions. Jeffree has nailed this Shane. Do the same. Never, ever read a comment, except mine.
I love how happy, healthy & grounded Jeffrey looks. Gosh he deserves it so much. Wyoming looks good on him!!!
Just wanna say that I am definitely someone who still watches YouTube every single day for entertainment.
Jeffrey caught my attention at paranormal energy lol as a paranormal Investigator im intrigued
You have to do something paranormal related with Jeffree! I loved that type of content from you back when. I'm glad that your both doing well. 😊And both doing well mentally. 👍🏻
I love how this unfolded organically and you let it all happen and shared it with us, rather than making some big fake production outta it. I love how real u and Jeffrey are and I love and support u both so much! Thank u for sharing your lives with us! I know you sacrifice alot to make this happen for us, and take alot of shit from alot of ppl. But please know you and JS BOTH bring alot of comfort and light to alot of us when we need it most!! 🤗 xo
YouTube sucks… but yet that’s do a series for views as we show off a cancelled palette. Okay then
I personally watch YouTube everyday lmao. Please do a scary Wyoming series together!
I lied, I love it still watching lol!! I thought it was old footage for some reason haha.. missed y’all together ❤
I need Jeffree Star to adopt me pls.
It’s not no one cares about YouTube. It’s no one is watching Makeup tutorials, makeup reviews anymore. He needs to do vlogs, like just film everyday regular stuff
I’m so confused, aren’t these old videos?
In Jeffree's spare time he's just a Dad lmao
Shane and jeffre is the best combo! They complete each other. Is like so different but same 😊
I feel like Shane and Jeffre is the best combo! They complete each other😊
Skip to 16:20 for the Jeffree actually making an appearance lol.
Who would change their comforter to a different brand every night?? Like of course you use the products every night it’s bedding
DEF waiting to see the ghost hunting series in Wyoming!
I understand what he means by not many people go home and actively watch YouTube anymore it's just sad because I love YouTube and watching you guys through the years, I've been watching Shane since he started YouTube.  I'ts just sad Jenna Marbles left, Julien barely uploads, You were gone for awhile. Now Jeffree wants to leave! It makes me wanna cry what am I gonna watch. Netflix and streaming services just aren't the same, its not real people. At least I can religiously  watch your videos and listen to your podcast as well as Rylands podcast. THANK YOU for making content, I'm glad you are happy!
idk it's pretty hard to come back from p3doph3lia dont u think u should maybe leave and stay gone and also go to prison idk
I literally can’t… I watch YouTube and the idea of Jeffree not being on YT sucks!! Also, 307 represent! But seriously…. Jeffree  or you can not stop!! I love you both!! 😢😢😢
I´m literally crying my eyeballs out because of Jeffree quiting youtube. The fact that someone who has inspired me so much for so many years to just keep on going regardless of everything is now feeling so un inspired just breaks my heart. I always admired him so much for being such a strong person and being able to build an entire empire out of nothing. He never gave up, He still shoot he´s shot even when he lost everything after he´s music career and was living in a one bedroom apartment (like the one I currently live in) he never lost hope. Launched three lipsticks that ended up becoming a huge success. Someone average would’ve just given up and stepped back from the spotlight and just gotten a normal job but he never stopped dreaming, even tothis day. I love you Jeffree and I also love you Shane. I grew up watching both of you guys since back in the day when shane kissed Onision and Jeffree kissed Matthew Lush, lmao such a weird thing to point out but anyways. Keep up the good work Shane. I´m so sorry you guys had to go through that cancelation and all that negativity on the internet, nobody deserves that. You’re the best. I hope shane never leaves YouTube, It would crush my heart to see that happen but sill willsupportyou guys on whatever platforms you guys migrate to.  Lot`s of Love -Alex Dimension.
i watch youtube more than netflix or any other streaming platform lol
cant wait for part 2 and 3
Just as much as we have to give people grace and understanding as well as provide them room to learn and grow, we must also realize and accept that we are responsible for our own actions and ACTIONS speak louder than words highly influenced by the public actually holding said person accountable. U cant just tuck your tail and hide and say what u think people wanted to hear because if you were actually sorry you wouldnt of needed someone to basically force it out of you.
That ending was pretty sad with what Jeffree was saying 😢 hopefully he changes his mind because as of today (13th November) 19.5million YouTube users would disagree with him cus they’ve clicked and watched a video with him 😢
Please don’t leave YouTube. I watch every day
I hate that you guys just hid and ignored all the outrage and basically avoided taking full accountability for YOUR actions. Im more concerned with what you’re actually doing that positively effects you and others around you. I personally dont agree with profiting off of pointless irrelevant content when you have a platform to do so much more and help so many more people than someone like J. Star.
I understand and support learning and growing from past mistakes, however the disgusting and intentionally disrespectful and degrading things that these two have said, done, supported, and most importantly PROFITED from are just unforgettable. I find it odd that people are still willing to watch and support people who could ever think and act that way… im not seeing any REAL signs of growth and accountability.
Tictok has no substance for me.
outside the airport showing off the gun 👏🏼😂
Um..I love this.
I watch his Youtube lol
this is giving tiger king
Oh my god my heart I’m crying so bad , he doesn’t understand, we are still there and care
YAY!!!!
He's really right and it's sad. YouTube is dying out because people are so busy now. Like tik tok takes 5 seconds so you can watch it anytime and when people do finally have time it's all Netflix and Disney+ YouTube might not be around much longer 😥
I don't get the hype about tiktoc ! I'll always love YouTube 😢😢😢 I like the long videos.  💔💗💗💗 it will never die or It better not I'll be lost
😥 Jeffree!
Tell Jeffery that there are still people who watch!!! I watch it still and it’s my favorite thing to watch!!!
Can we just appreciate for a second how they flew in economy despite having more than enough money to buy first seat tickets? And how Jeffrey came to personally pick the guys up from the airport without security or anything? Having said that though, I HIGHLY disagree with Jeffree on his Youtube opinion. As someone who doesn't own a TV, Disney+, Netflix etc, I rely SOLELY on Youtube for my evening entertainment. Youtube is my only source of videos. Just because Jeffree got canceled due to his own actions and therefore lost viewers, doesn't mean Youtube is dead. I watch Youtube videos every single day and I know millions upon millions do too. I mean just look at this video. 2 MILLION views is just FOUR DAYS. Youtube will never die.
Can’t wait for the next episode! 🫶🏽
Oh fuk ya do a paranormal series ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does it just mean I'm old that I prefer YouTube to tiktok? The only way I can into tiktok is if I watch a YouTuber sharing tiktoks they've found lol.  I love the anticipation of looking forward to new content on YouTube, and I always will.~
I know it’s life and it’s way better than industrialized farms but I’m over here getting emotional at the cute yaks and babies that may be gone already😢
You guys are hilarious together naturally I love you guys
I believe the art of YouTube film will prevail
“No one’s clicking anymore” no we’re all depressed and miserable bc the internet itself sucks and cancels everything so we’re not allowed to enjoy anything without being scrutinized. I remember how much shit I got for saying I like you or Shane all throughout your guys cancellations. You guys got me through so much and then having no Shane videos or anything I liked to help get me through life just kinda kicked my ass so I barely even open YouTube anymore bc cancel culture and tea channels literally ruined it for me
The icons are back
I didn't realize that the conspiracy pallet came out before covid thats so long ago
So much growth! I love all of you even MOREEEE!!☺️☺️☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bitch lol I still click and watch YouTube! I do think a haunted series would be epic!
WE NEED THE CORONAVIRUS CONSPIRACY VIDEO PLEASE
help me kill my enemys or fuck off
I love the new jeffery. He looks at peace with himself.
I adore you both together. I'll forever admire, respect you and  Jeffree star despite the drama!  This is the comeback you both need, you all deserve this. Thank you for allowing us to be here for the journey ❤️
He’s botting, I can’t believe he’s still working with him he’s the reason you got cancelled anyways I hate both of them
I have never laughed so hard haha this episode was sooooo good your guys energy is absolutely amazing and fun and I love watching you guys together xoxoxo can’t wait for part 3!
I’m invested in this series, just seeing the both of you grow and Jeffrey being so happy and truly humbled makes me so happy for y’all 🥺
colorado air is actually very polluted 😂
HIRL DIDNT HE SHIT ON YOU??
I still watch YouTube and I still get excited when I see Jeffree has posted a video. Plz don’t quit ❤❤
Please don't let him quit I am one of the OG people and I literally only watch YouTube 😭😭😭
I still watch YT….   😮❤❤❤
"Hauntings of wiyoming in the mystery machine"
I disagree with the no one cares about YouTube statement. I myself and many of users are still YouTube watchers. I myself had TikTok since the pandemic but I can’t just sit there scrolling watching 100s of clips, I prefer watching YouTube videos with its podcasts, tutorials or just plain ole collaborations. With that being said I do understand his pov and I’m actually proud of his growth 🙏💕
I still love YouTube lol. Shane, Ryland, even Jeffree. Loved this videos.
I love your videos! Shane never quit YouTube!
I understand that TikTok is popular with the younger generation, but I’m 29 and I still watch YouTube all the time. We not be teenagers/the standard target demographic but there are still a lot of viewers that prefer the “older” apps/mediums. I also looked at Jeffers’s page and all of his recent videos have at least a million views (there are only 3 in the last 2 years under that and they are at like 850/950K) so I don’t quite understand how he thinks no one cares 🤔 maybe it’s not getting the same numbers as TikTok but that’s still significant, no?! I guess when you take into account the fact that his videos used to regularly get 17M, 30M views, I kind of see how 1M, 2M can seem disappointing…. but not really. I still feel like that is SO MANY fans lol.
I literally started clapping when Jeffree and Maddie walked into the airport. SO GOOD to see you together again.
I fucking love Jeffree he’s the same sexy bitch I fell in love with back in MySpace years and I’m sorry but no one can tell me his lips and concealer isn’t the best in the world because it is
Absolutely loving that J.S. Sharing the other side of fame. He really is so inspiring!!
like ❤if u guys want the conspiracy theories to come backkk
Just know that your videos have helped me through difficult times. Thank you for coming back. I'm happy to see you smiling.
awesome seires also the song thats in the buffy ad is so good :D
this is amazing!!! also it would break my heart if you and ryland and even morgan ever said that nobody cares about your videos anymore...its literally the highlight of my week when i see any of you posted! i wish i could just be yalls real friend lol!!! so proud of you and glad this series is happening!!!!!
Please don’t leave because jefree is leaving 😢
This video doesnt have 30 million views but Shane and Jeffree can still pull 2 million views in the first 4 days.
I’m so glad him and Maddie are OK. That’s amazing.
My soul felt so good watching this ❤❤❤ also side note…I love y’all but the music in the background while y’all are having a convo makes it hard to understand y’all and overstimulating 😅😅
PLEASE COLLAB WITH SAM AND COLBY❤
Please keep this duo together
HARD disagree on Jeffree’s view on YouTube, especially since this video and his last few videos still got millions of views.
It makes me so sad to hear Jeffree wants to quit YouTube. I’m more interested in him and his life than I ever was. I want to learn everything there is to know about yaks from none other than Jeffree freaking Star.
2 million views in 4 days. I think people are watching.. LMFAO
I watched this like three times already. I can't believe Jeffree's made 12 pallets since conspiracy. I wish I could buy them but I'm a broke ass bitch. However if they release the cancelled palette I will make sure to get it!
i'm sad.... i'm just freaking sad.... this is the end of an era... i'm not prepared, i don't want to... I love you guys TY for everything
2 million views my A! YouTube allows the inverts to play with the subscription numbers and views ☠️🤮🤮🤮🤮 sick!
Its so nice to see such love and respect towards each other
YOUTUBE IS NOT DEAD!!!!!!!
Such a feel good video!! <3 the music >
i was feeling so nervous about my performance to be on stage . watched this video and the memories it brought helped me get through the night for some reason, i had a great performance. i’m glad you guys are back doing videos together, i want moreeee!!!!!
Couldn't put my finger on why Jeffree looked so different but then I realized he actually has eyebrows now. They didn't look drawn on at least. Glad he's happy and stress free, he looks great.
Why watch scripted series when YouTube has real entertaining people to watch
Omg new pallet collab name should be called Cancelled! 😂
No one clicks 2 million views 😂😂😂
I'm going to miss seeing Jeffree on YouTube but I am SO proud of him for all of his progress. He's been someone I love watching since he was doing music and when he was on myspace back in the day. I have a lot of love for Jeffree and my heart is full seeing his new life. I am so fucking happy for him and I hope Shane is too. I can't really tell what he's thinking but I'm just so proud.
i hope they rebirth yt again bcause tiktok is starting to die off like keek 😭
miss these vibes 😭🥹
I really hope Shane doesn’t leave YouTube forever just because of what Jeffree said 😖
Okay hear me out. Do a Cancel Pallet and name the shades scandals y’all had. Bc I would buy the shit out of that and respect y’all so much for taking control of y’all’s bs drama!
Warning: Parts of this video isn’t vegan/vegetarian friendly.
Okay if there’s no follow up videos on the paranormal activity I QUIT😭😭😭
Shane x Jeffree Palette Yesssss please!❤ And so happy seeing you guys together! 🎉🎉 also ghost hunting pls! Love that.
Aww no, don't quit Youtube :(
"I Haven't CHANGED!!! It's all about my ankles, it's about health"
I still watch youtube daily, but my interests have changed I watch live stream resellers.
I love that all of you have finally realized the mantra of “this to shall pass” and I am so happy for you both!
I care. I still watch you tube.
What song is playing during the Buffy ad at the beginning of the video? Does anyone know?????
I disagree with Jeffree. If I am going to watch a video (rather than a tv show or movie) it's going to be a longer yt video or podcast. I am not into the shorty Lil videos. If I have a small amount of time in not thinking about videos, I'll do a game or a text or something. Never even been on tiktok before. Idk is just not my thing. Maybe I'm old tho
But Jeffree I watch you. I love your new life. I'd rather watch that then the freaking Kardashians. I need to see fancy things bc I don't have anything.
Im the girl that goes home and looks forward to watching YouTube!! It is not lost please convince jeffree otherwise!! And don’t stop your videos.
I truly love Jeffrey’s new perspective on life living with less I so much went through this in the last 18 months because I saw that losing my mom changed my way of thinking she had so much stuff but you truly cannot take it with you and it woke me up-I got rid of all my hand bags,some shoes and clothes basically cleared out my house and personal life of all the toxicity-I really enjoyed this-more please❤
36 thousand dislikes hahahah
It's so fucking admirable and amazing to see Jeffree just settling down and getting down to his roots, looking so happy and healthy and just unbothered and at peace 😌
Watching this with so many tears pouring down my face. As a fellow Scorpio, I know how intense we are. We love strong, we live large and we fall hard. Jeffree I am so proud  of you. So happy to see you this way.
I wish Shane would stop with the nervous fake laughing with that camera person and frustrated comedic commentary. He comes off so strange and not genuine
I love y’all soooooo much!!! Literally hysterical over the ending and ready for part 2!❤❤❤❤❤
Jeffree we don't want you to quit! You have brought so much amazing content and you make people strive to be like you. I just started my own collectibles business & opening my own collectibles store in Kingsland GA! I took a risk & I'm hoping it pays off. You prove that ambition & hard work pays off. Thank you for all the years of content & hard work. Shane please don't quit, we love all of you! Keep inspiring people! Much love from GA 💛
I watch YouTube and do not use tiktok at all cuz I’m 32 but understand everyone loves it 😂
I’m so here for this. Plz do the haunted series w Jeffree 🥺🥺
Im so excited for this series i love the conspiracy pallets 😫 they are so versatile i would buy if it came back ☺️☺️☺️
I think that you should do a series with a person of color......Share da spotlight with them. Show off your personal growth....
Jeffree: “a stupid Texas twang” Me, a Texan: 🥺
Did Jeffery just dox himself?
You always show the best side of Jeffery and it always gives me faith in him. His growth is everything!
Jeffrey's launching a star yak burger 🍔 wtf he has them as pets yet he can  eat them like there nothing 😆 omg thts hilarious
We will miss you if you leave youtube jeffree. During the pandemic i feel as if we just wanted more out of these channels, series like these are more enjoyable. Best of luck in your future businesses
Sure Youtube isn’t in it’s prime era right now but it’s not dead!!! Some of us still prefer youtube over Netflix, Disney and even tiktok!!!!
Jeffree looks so good!
I'm devastated about jeffree leaving... I feel like I'm losing a friend, a family member... I'm going to miss him so much, I'll be waiting for the day he comes back, I also feel so left alone, what does he mean nobody cares or nobody watches youtube anymore.. we're right here 😭
I don't blame Jeffree for quitting YT.. the best thing is that he knows where to find the true meaning of happiness
Youtube over short form will always be the actual way to keep a bond with us, short form feels so disconnected, the views on tik tok mean nothing to people
Just no way omgg that’s all I have to say
Broooo not Jeffery retiring I’m always on y’all side
I think I just fell in love with Jeffree Star all over again ❤️ And I think Jeffree has left Shane a bit shook .
Just got back from a cruise and cannot wait to watch! Catching up on all my vids xo
Shane, I PROMISE you no matter what you make I will click. I will watch. You have brought me so many laughs and I feel like you’re my only friend. I love you so much and so proud of you ❤❤❤
The car conversation felt so much like home, i can't even explain it
Shane please stay
I love this so much. Literally just so happy to see you all so happy❤️❤️
Okay, but I still love the long form content.! We're so thankful you're back with another series. It's unfortunate but Jeffree has a point. It's so hard to continue on this app. Short form has taken over. I dont think it's over though. YouTube is still the one treating content creators better than anyone else.
I feel like loads of us who have grown up with YouTube are all in our 30s now with kids etc so finding the time to watch YouTube jsut doesn’t happen anymore like it used to, can’t binge and be committed like we were 10 years ago when everyone was in the height of it!
and I'm over here watching dead Youtube.
The way Jeffrey walked in the airport is like “THIS IS JEFFREE WORLD”
vegans are quaking
ok but i can’t express how much i missed these videos, AND THEYRE BACK  it’s the Shane Jeffree combination for me. Jeffree was right, no one watches youtube for fun anymore (at least the makeup side) but THIS is everything!!!! Love you Shaffree❤️
I love the laughter between them all ❤
Shane please!!! We are waiting for new episode! I love this series so much! ❤
Youtube is my every day safe place!! My only escape, you guys really are a lot of people's safe place, please keep doing what you do, we're right here 💖💖
I watch it still!!!!!  That is absolutely heartbreaking that Jeffree feels that way about posting videos on YouTube anymore. I look forward to see videos of Jeffree and Shane and would hate for it all to go away. It helps me from going to a very dark place when I'm already struggling enough. So for what it's worth, I can't tell you how many times you've saved my life watching both of y'all's videos over and over again. 🥺
We just got an electric car and my husband did the 0-60 move and I felt my soul leave my body
So sad 😞
And this is how you avoid cancel culture- you don't give it any energy and live your best life. Bravo Jeffree and Shane!
the way it's so interesting to see jeffree change so drastically for his own good. Like moving out from LA would have been such a relief.
This making me wanna watch the full series for the 30th time <- actual number! ♥️😂
I Watch YouTube everyday. I like watching ppls real life not scripted Netflix
Of course he's got a silencer on that gun🙃😂☻
Jeff: “YouTube sucks and no one watches it”  All of us watching YouTube: 😳😅
No one is watching beauty content, that is trye. But the rest is fine.
Are you dressing for the Airport in Casper?  I'm like, please, I'm from Wyoming, you don't dress for anything.  And, if you do, they'll know you don't belong.  That said, Casper is a big town for Wyoming so, they like fancy and shit there.  Also, Wyoming, if you aren't rich, is hell, so there's no reason to worry about epening a porthole to hell.
“This feels like rehab” 🤨  Leave it up to Shane to say something stupid/offensive 🙄
12
I'm actually tearing up seeing Jeffree and Shane together again. I didn't pay attention to any of the drama or why they were canceled. Wear my Conspiracy palette frequently. I just love their friendship and wish them both the best.
Great music and great filming syncing with it!! Chris and Shane are so talented.
I say do whatever makes you happy, we (fans) will follow anywhere you go (through thick and thin) the naysayers will always be there because something wrong in there lives, don't let it affect you, feel pity for them and move on to happier things and those that follow, follow and those that don't, good luck 🤞 blessings always to you Jeffrey and to you Shane and Ryland a fan for life ♉
Missed these so much!!!
why did he change the title?
But where is king cobra mfs!!!!!!!😂
Shane acts like he’s poor and don’t got money but he’s worth over $10 milli so he got money if it’s 6 figures or more.
If you wake up full of sweat that’s disgusting and weird and u need to go see a doctor lmaooo
Loved and missed this type of video. Missed you Shane
I don’t watch Shane but I can see why ppl love him. I only watch Shane when he’s with Jeffrey cuz I love both energies together cuz it’s definitely a vibe.
I miss Jeffree 😢
Well it's quite clear, but I still watch Youtube lol. I don't understand TikTok.
The sheer joy and love they share is beautiful x
I only watch my fav ppl on yt... so sad to hear jeffree say no ones watching anymore... i rewatch his vids often...
I watch for enjoyment. I miss the old YouTube
I still watch YouTube like TV. I have Disney+ and other streaming services. But im still watching YouTube more than any other platform. Fuck Tik Tok!
Amazing!!!
Jeffree living his best life and shane living his is amazing ❤ so happy for you both
Love the song you put at the end it was perfect and thought out ! I finally started tiktok this yr myself because I don't like change sometimes 🙃
Ok I'm watching this late but omfg I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVVVEEE seeing you n Jeffree together again, you guys are such a vibe.  I never want this series to end soooo u need to make hundreds more, I'm sure with Jeffree ALONE u never know what he finna do.  I love u guys so much and Shane you're amazing n I'm so happy you're back
Shane don’t let him make you feel that way. There are still so many of us who LOVE YouTube and longer form video. I literally love it so much it interrupts my life! Lol I don’t get stuff done cause I’m watching youtube
Omg! I love ❤️ this reunion
I'm trying to get myself back together too, Shane.   All of your little victories are inspiring to me because I know they aren't so little.  So happy you are still here!
Watched twice cause I miss Jeffery so much 😢 YouTube ruined itself, it censored everyone ruining a lot of what made channels so entertaining like Jeffery Star early days before all the amazing pallets. Can’t wait for part two ❤
Jeffree leaving youtube is one of the saddest moments 💔 not true that nobody watches Jeffree. At least youtube is free not like Netflix and you are paying money and do not get the whole thing. Series and movies are shown based by regions? What? That's hella messed up. People should be able to see EVERY series/movies, unless the movie or series are affecting certain country negatively or goes against the country. But taking out series/movies without any value reason is just messed up and that just shows what a cashgrab Netflix is
SHANE .. PLS NEVER QUIT YOUTUBE UR ACTUALLY MY HAPPINESS I LOVE YOU WAY TO MUCH FOR U TO STOP POSTING
Please don’t let him quit YouTube 😭
after the last few years, I still can't get over JEFREE STAR living in my small little hometown of Casper, WY. The documentary is amazing, you're both amazing! I can't wait for PART 3! 💖
I haven’t finished watching yet, but I seriously love Jeffree and Shane together! Their energy is just radiating when they are together! 💕
Love how quick people are to forgive them lol. They could commit murder and people would still be like "OH BUT THEY HAVE CHANGED! WE ALL GROW AND LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖"
Not me crying that Jeffree is leaving YouTube but if it doesn’t bring him joy I fully support his decision
Shane holding the gun was my favorite- he so lost on what to do
All this is a no for me. Still two very problematic people who should live their life without doing YouTube.
Thank you sooo much!!! I love both you and Jeffrey!!! You both are the best, I was heart broken from everything that has happened the past couple of years. But I know that your comeback will be epic.. and I was right!!! Can’t wait for the next parts… wishin’ you all the best!!!
Jeffree is living the life that these Maga "alpha males" dream of He's truly an alpha
They’re not as censored as they used to be lol
Ommggg I can’t believe this is happening. I’m shocked . I’m mean wow that’s really good for him , i can tell he is not stress and not having anxiety everything going on . He looks happy and relax you know . I will miss him not ganna lie . I Just wanted to check up on him , how’s he doing
Ommggg I can’t believe this is happening. I’m shocked . I’m mean wow that’s really good for him , i can tell he is not stress and not having anxiety everything going on . He looks happy and relax you know
wrong youtube doesn't suck i still watc it. tiktok sucks
In all the series, I just can’t get over how Jeffree is stunningly beautiful! Almost ethereal.
Isn’t it mind blowing how all the big well known people that lived in LA. Have left? Just shows everyone runs thinking that LA is the place to get big. But literally everyone is leaving. ❤ it’s obviously not a good place.
This is the best he’s right no one goes on YouTube but it’s people like you or even him even JENNA MARBLES that I’m still sticking around for YouTube!
I still watch YouTube. Obviously.
Jeffrey looks so happy and healthy
Thank you for this vide o for your fans we love it and jstarrr!!!!
loved the video. cant wait for more. it was sad to hear yt is fizzling out. i still use it as my primary entertainment.
I love this iconic duo, I'm glad they're making vids again!
You are the only one I always want to see your videos on youtube 😢
The amount of growth everyone not just Shane and Jeffrey have done is just outstanding and it’s amazing to see friendship laughs and giggles not hiding the camera or “ speak off camera about that “ just living their best life’s and taking us on the journey amazing 🥺🥰
U may never see this.....  I never knew you from b4 being " canceled ".  I like who you are becoming!!  You and your sweet family are hilarious!!!  You have a new fan!!! XOXO
600 acres is every country boys dream and then some
Cant stand the new camera guy giggling all the time 🤦🏻‍♀️
WHY do yall have a USA flag? Stop trying to please straight ppl
Nooo don’t leave YT jefferee! We love you
Whan you have so much money you can stop care about everything...
I am SO happy for him. He is living a healthy, happy life now. I am on the SAME journey as him and it is so liberating. 🥰 I loved this video and I can't wait to see MORE!
I'm so glad to see you guys together!! I love Jefferees new house and life is beautiful!! That's how I wanna live in the middle of no where!! I don't even care if it's a small house!
The background music was so loud FOR WHAT
This is the best YouTube video I’ve seen in a long long time. So wholesome. So much love. ❤😢❤😢
Jeffree you truly changed for the better and have grown so much. Sending love 💕 I've been a supporter since the beginning and this stage of your life..... WOW. You lived, you learned, you've grown.
Eat the rich.
YouTube isn’t dead, people just stopped watching you guys lol.
Welcome back shane ❤
Me praying the palette is called "CANCELED" omg that would be everything
I feel like jeffree has truly grown with his audience. He's growing and taming life like those of us that have been there since the beginning. I'm happy for jeffree. He seems genuinely peaceful and content
I'm happy for your friendship and you guys are back together. I still watch YouTube lol.
👍
i will forever be a youtube girl. i think it should be addressed that part of the downfall of youtube was that the same creators who made youtube great ditched the platform. so many moved on from youtube to pursue other things or stopped posting as much, how can you expect the audience to stay? the loyalty goes both ways. i definitely feel a sort of abandonment over the years. it's easy to move on to tiktok but very few actually try and grow their youtube and expand their content with the times.
How does this creep still have a platform
This hurts seeing top creators quit and say YouTube is dead. It makes me fear that Shane and Ryland might end up feeling the same way!
I love you guys and your friendship soo much. This made me cry. 😢❤
Omg a second collection ❤❤❤❤ please
the last ten mins really got me I used to use YouTube for my primary entertainment
I literally jump on YouTube nowadays for Shorts and show highlights from Netflix or Anime. YouTube has changed alot. There's no real content that originates from YouTube, it's just a search engine now.
I'm not on YouTube but on Instagram and I have seen the change over the months, I totally understand Jeffree. Why put work into content that no one will see because the algorithm sucks ? If you don't pay for ads you never appear on anyone's feed
😢
youtube IS starting to suck. the worst is honestly the search engine lmao i hate it, its literally useless.
Honestly, it's really sad to see our favourite youtubers quitting but yknow what, I think Jeffree is the type of person to really think things through, at least from what I've observed in recent years, so I respect his decision and I think if he'll be happier without it, then it's amazing for him. I really see such a change in Jeffree and he seems so much happier and so much more at peace with himself and his life, this will be just one more big big step towards that direction and I'm sure he won't be quitting all other social media anytime soon so I look forward to seeing what he brings us in the future. Truly one of my all time favourite youtubers
Y'all saying Jeffree is leaving YouTube cause he's no longer popular and no longer getting views. I think he just doesn't enjoy YouTube anymore. I mean he's still one of the biggest beauty influencers out there and i feel like he's slowly transitioning to TikTok
Tictok sucks. I had a account and I could've gotten big over there with my cats but I don't trust the app. China is stealing data. V
But why is he a yak farmer now lmao
❤️ you
Jeffree Star is less than a joke!!!! NASTY 🤬!!!!
OH HELL NO!😳 NOT JEFFREE WANTING TO LEAVE YOUTUBE!!😭😭  I love his phenomenal makeup/realness/reviews/tutorials & the series/collabs with Shane are EPIC! I'm on YouTube more than any other app, I can't imagine not seeing new uploads from Jeffree, forreal I'm gonna be so heartbroken if he leaves!!💔🥺🙏
Tell Jeffree we need him in YouTube !! I deleted tiktok and don’t want it back:( less social media more positivity. Please don’t leave.
Not me coming home after a long day to watch YT videos lmaooo 👀
Huh, I go on tic tok for like 5 minutes and I am done
#UNcancelshanedawson #UNcancelshanedawson
The problem is considering everyone is turning to tiktok that app is utter trash and looking at younger generations their mental health is even shittier. I really don't blame jeffree for leaving youtube and the fact that he's parked in the middle of nowhere i think a lot feel the same way where we just want to block everyone out. But i feel like tiktok could grab hold of him again negatively, like he says he used to be on phone on the time but tiktok can bring you back into that negative mind space. But it's business at the end of the day. Interesting how he's not mentioned his weed business at all whether that's still going on.
The growth out of you two has been amazing 🙌 happy to see you more grounded and in a better place. Much love 🖤
I don't think YouTube is dead yet, tiktok is just a phase for kids and the wanna-be-trendy, I've never even had it either, maybe it's because I'm 34 and don't care to share myself lip-sincing and dancing lol.  Shane's videos definitely suit the YouTube platform, maybe Jeffrey's didn't... Would love to see more videos of Shane exploring weird or 'haunted' places with friends. Would also love to see the 'spooky boys' return!
Jeffree will be missed I love watching him and you guys.
This bring me so much joy like i watched the Docs back then and now woooaw!
I love this new Jeffree. Im here for it ❤
Nobody clicks on your videos anymore because your target demographic has grown up.  They’re still watching YouTube… they’re just watching content that is more in line with where they are now in life. You have to adjust and change with the times or you get left behind.  The younger viewers, who you would have originally attracted are more interested in the instant gratification they get from TikTok while your original subscribers have grown up and moved on.   People aren’t interested in toxicity anymore. It’s not cute. I think the pandemic made people acutely aware of how much toxicity was in their life and the source of it.  Just one viewer’s (and ex-subscriber of Jeffree) opinion.
That's the Jeffree we need, that's the Jeffree we love!
I'm w J⭐️ on the TikTok thing.. it's the 1st app I go to & spend the most time on. I don't watch YT like I use to but my notifications are on for my fav YouTubers!
Omfg the YouTube overseers shit themselves simultaneously during that last 1.5 minutes. What are they gonna do? Not invite you to YouTube rewind 😂
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
O haye uou
This content is so out of touch now
I wouldn’t say people are moving away from YouTube.. I would say trends are changing people get bored of channels and forget about them. Also doesn’t help that jeffree star often isn’t a nice person putting people off watching his channel. Similar with Shane those “scandals” didn’t help didn’t bother me but I just got bored of the silly ghost videos over reacting to a creaking floor board and calling it haunted..  the content is turning out to be over dramatised and often boring. 🤷🏽‍♂️ this is probably the first one I’ve watched due to another channel reacting to it which wasn’t a positive reaction they had to skip atleast first 10 mins because nothing was said just moaning and dramatising nothing because Shane wouldn’t say what it was..
🎉🎉🎉
No one is watching bcuz the content stopped. And the little dribs and drabs that were put out were mediocre in between launches. 🤷🏼‍♀️
YouTube really does suck. Their terrible algorithm and shady business practices have completely sucked the joy out of it. Though I still have a few ppl that I come on the watch and will be waiting for part 3 💕
"As long as you don't use they/them, you'll be fine" 😭😭
“YouTube sucks, no one watches it anymore” as we’re on YouTube 🤣
I mean … we’re still watching, we just don’t watch you anymore
YouTube over short videos.
I think he does realise less is more and he doesn’t want to live that life because it was not giving him happiness
When he said no one was watching I felt that cause I was saying this to myself the other day like damn I have so many videos to watch but that’s cause I’ll spend 2 weeks watching Netflix or Hulu never switching over to YouTube  so that made me sad ,however I do feel TikTok and instagram and more for makeup related videos and tutorials while YouTube is for vlogs and podcast now .   Also I really do love Jeffre like even before this it’s something about his personality that makes me smile
What's my motto of the year? SOOO 😅😅
Genuinely so glad he’s found real peace and happiness, everyone deserves this
I'm really sad jeffree is not doing YouTube anymore becuz I've been such a huge fan for so long.. but I understand. You have to move on and after going through what you two have gone through it's understandable.. I wish Nothing but happiness for you (shane) ALL of your family and Jeffree and all of his family. ❤❤ I hope he does check in's every so often. ❤❤❤ much love to all of you guys!!!
YOU JUST MADE MY DAY. YOU. MADE. MY. DAY !!! ❤❤❤❤
how can jeffree say no one watches it anymore with 890k views on his last upload?????? is that bad?
As I still watch YouTube everyday lol
I think YouTube is only dead because the creators stop creating :( they stopped filming stuff (like this) that people loved to watch and talk about
They gave away the name of the pallet  in the airport scene at about 14:08 when they put a unnecessary subtitle and the the word cancelled in italics.  Then I remembered what the said about the name being so fitting.
Shane is so cringe now….
😢 WoW! This is bittersweet! Can’t believe JEFREE, as soon as he said he sold millions for his stuff, I’m like WoW!! Now quitting YouTube? Now Ik I’m getting old! But hope he’s happy, that’s all what matters in the end!❤
i still care about youtube jeffree i love you and shane and ryland so much!! <3
Jeffree is so right about people going to tiktok and not YouTube. I literally barely check YouTube anymore xd
is that you singing shane?
i know people have a LOT to say but i like it when your with jeffree its a lot of fun, its a dream we all wish we were living and i love watching you live it. you and jeffree are just people like us so it feels great. keep it up. i dont care what the drama people say. they dont live your life and only know u online. go for it
This video made me so happy. Jeffree is so damn funny.
shane where did you get your iphone case!!!!!?????
Am I the only one who despises TikTok and only watches YouTube? Lol 😆
I genuinely thought about jeffree quitting youtube at the beginning and was stunned when I was right. I have to admit I do miss them together, this just took me back to 2019 I was crying and screaming
Ugh these videos are my happy place
Make a VCR case pallet and a tape pallet
People are leaving to rumble now 😂🙌
this is a everything i needed.
I love how Jeffree had so much conviction when he said “like we have the fucking stones” then it’s like he was overloaded with emotions and helplessness when he said “we’ll watch it later idk cheers and shrugs “
Jeffree is good at holding conversations
Don't leave YouTube, Shane. ❤ Please. Stay with us. We will always continue to watch. ❤
AMAZING to see you guys back together again 🥰 cannot wait for #2 & #3 😘
of course give the hispanic male a michelada >.<
Ryland comforting Shane on the plane by simply holding his hand and trying not to overreact is the sweetest thing ever. I don't think people realize how much of a positive impact Ryland has had on Shane's life... Absolutely adorable.
Jeffrey looks so healthy, happy and at peace! He honestly looks so great. Can't say I ever imagined Jeffery Star getting into the farm life and selling top tier meat. Kinda cool imo!  Hate or like Shane - you have to admit he knows how to film and produce. You can see the effort and passion he has for his productions and they're always interesting/entertaining. We've all been waiting for this, Shane. Haters included. :) Can't wait for the next part and to see your future projects!
I watch YouTube for fun still…
I love it!!! Jeffree looks so healthy and he’s glowing. Also he’s living my actual dream. I am so proud of you both 🎉❤😊
Dang. I am genuinely so happy to see you two again enjoying each other face-to-face, talking, reminiscing, being real, sharing your lives, feeling those deep emotions together... there is something about those kind of friendships that are so intense, so life-changing, so beautiful... priceless. And, ground moving. Even literally. Hahaha.   Shane, you inspire me to pursue my life with such raw honesty & watching your videos always gets my creative juices pumpin'. xD Continue to pursue your passions and what you feel is right for you in the moment, because it truly trickles down the lane and is so enlightening, especially for me as a person and a creator. If you ever see this, thank you. So much. :] ♡   I'm excited to see the rest of the series!!!
I don't believe or I should say, agree, with what Jeffree states about YouTube. Plenty of people are still watching if the content and/or the creator is worth watching!
I stopped watching youtube completely when cancel culture started and Shane and Jenna left. I have hope now
He gave up his collection of bags 😭 gosh he knows the real life
i died when jeffrey took out the gun lmaoo
Everything is cyclical but YouTube is still the best the views are just more spread out, as those streaming services keep increasing I think it will come back somewhat
Jeffrees a whole new type of badass now. I was around since youtube was made. I loved snuggling in bed after school and watching shane dawson, super mac, all that lol and I WATCH JEFFREE. The ending made me cry :(
Love this
The beauty community in YouTube is not the same anymore. People are so done with the dramas. Who cares with the dramas anymore. More and more youtubers are storming tiktok. I just watched nikkietutorials live make over yesterday in tiktok. I think tiktok pays more to the content creators. Aside from the gifts during live, payments are done with views/likes.  Jeffrey star doesn't need the fame anymore. He's happy in his 600 acres of land, the yak business. Even if he quits youtube, he still earning millions of money.
Honestly this makes me wanna smile, because Jeffree is kind of right in his own ay. Youtube is not DYING per se but there is definitely alternate platforms available, and he is growing up as well, so he is maturing and slowly branching out and doing other stuff. Its interesting, because he is a suave business man so he knows how the wind blows, he is slowly inching into the food/agricultural industry which is so interesting to me. Jeffree, Michelle Phan, they really know how to invest and do business really well.
I still want the Shane 2 palette 😢😢😢😢😢
Jeffrey looks so healthy and handsome and happy
I watch YouTube the most. And yeah you're not getting 30million clicks but the almost 2 million watches of your last video is from people who care. I haberdashery no desire for tiktok and beauty, it doesn't teach me how to do anything and so much is faked.
Jeffree with all of the jokes! I was laughing so much!
YouTube is slowly dying especially since they added the double ads. Everytime Shane posts I always want to watch. No matter what content he’s filming he makes it fun, interesting and relatable. ❤love you Shane
no ones clicking anymore... video gets 1.8 million views. But lets be honest youtube was not kind to shane or jeffree.
I love this Jeffrey! Happiness looks so good on him.🤍
now im sad
Shane we are still riding for you on you tube !! I will always watch if your uploading I know Jeffery is ready to chill out but the haunted series would be so hilarious!
I for one really enjoyed this 😭
It does seem all very fake and contrived tbh..
Did he just admit to smoking weed in Wyoming 😳
not gonna lie.. jeffree got funnier haha
Ugh I don’t care Jeffree is so funny 😭😭
Damn.. I watch YouTube like mad
they are so fucking funny together
I understand where Jeffrey is coming from, about quiting YouTube. But would would he at least leave the channel up for the true\real fans out there? For us to watch back or even binch watch lol :D
I dooooo I come here for enjoyment 🤍🤍🤍
shane i love your content but is there any way for you to add more accurate closed captions for your videos? i’m HOH and i’m sure I and all HOH folks out there who enjoy your videos would love some better captions so we can understand what’s actually going on in the video! keep up the great work !!!  ❤❤❤❤
I can't imagine YouTube without jeffree
i mean back in the day this video would already have 10 million views… So
Me living in Wyoming my whole life, currently living in Casper and watching this saying "I know this place been there!"
Star can't be done. Shane needs to film a reality show about the stars' new life.
I would like to try the Yak meat
I prefer YouTube than tiktok. Screens just different and the protection is different
I hope it’s not a cash grab for a make up palette
everything always comes to an end and Im happy for Jeffree for deciding it was time to do so! They're doing so well for themselves, YT is just something that was in the past and now it is time for a whole new chapter! Congrats to them for realizing it! I hope for the best for them of course; seems like Wyoming was God's calling for them all along! I hope to visit the state to trye their yak burgers one day! Looks delicious!
I’m heartbroken that he thinks nobody cares and that nobody watches. 2 videos? I’m gunna be replaying his old videos like a friends marathon.
Oh my GOD.. the jeffree and shane series is back ♡ ♥
I love YouTube you shane and star are my favorite YouTubeers I'll don't know what I'll do not being able to watch him it's good for my depression and heath but I know people grow I wish the best for you Jeffrey
Mhh yeah, i mean i still watch yt regulary, still but not makeup stuff ... just other things... ppl grow also up and generations change....  ppl watch tic toc wich i dont.... but i am.old woman lol on the  Internet from 94 on... I love jeffry with short hair and baseball cap... the farmer look suits him well... still jeffrey...
I watch Jeffrey star I'll miss him
Does Jeffree have an internship? 🤣 high key would apply the farming fits in my field
Omg this is everything to me. I wish I was apart of this crew surrounded by love and sincerity!!!! Been here since the days of Shane being Jeffree with shocks on top of shocks! Thank you for making this!!! Can't wait for the next episode 😍 #dynamicduo
I don’t think I have ever seen Jeffree look so beautiful as he does when he picked Shane, Ryland and Chris up from the airport. He is either wearing no, or very little makeup and he is just looking so incredibly beautiful. In Shane’s last series with Jeffree, doing the makeup palette, any time we saw Jeffree sans makeup, he just looked so tired, I guess. Like he said, he was just incredibly busy back then. His new life is certainly doing amazing things for him, because I don’t think I have ever seen him look this healthy! Wyoming certainly suits him. Oh, and I do think that Jeffree always looks stunning in his intense makeup looks, but I love seeing this softer side of him and it makes Jeffree so much more physically attractive in my eyes. I can’t wait to meet the yaks in the next episode. But I am stunned about Jeffree leaving YouTube! I mean, I am not really into makeup, but I do love skincare. I always love watching Jeffree in this style of video, more of a vlog than anything else. Plus I don’t ever watch TikTok! Excellent work Shane, I really love this video and can’t wait for the next. 😘🙏🏼💜🌸
Is it just me or is everyone especially Ryland literally laughing hysterically to the point of tears at the most benign things non-stop in this video? It’s making me so uncomfortable. Jeffree makes an innocuous comment and they’re all screaming of laughter, it’s disorienting and confusing.
I would watch a reality show of Jeffree so quick.
I cried....good tears and sad tears.
You live in my state now and in my town I will not hesitate to throw something at you in public or heckle you with my communication degree stay the hell away from Parker!
Why Jeffrey look so manly... dang!
YouTube is the only thing I watch. Im Shane’s age. I’m prolly holding onto nostalgia I guess.. but thinking about all my favorite creators being gone is soul crushing
It's true, I haven't sat on YouTube for over 15 minutes in IDK how long. But I made time to sit down and watch these 2 episodes and I missed this so much.❤ Shane and Jeffree brought me back. Anxiously waiting for new episodes.
Not even mad about that car advertisement. Damn it. Shane, that was slick. 👏
The long hair makes you look really creepy
❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕
Jeffree is living my dream life rn
That stray hair that kept poking out of Jeffrees hat drove me mad that entire car clip. 😂 Glad to see him happy though!
I used to always was Jeffrey’s videos after the Conspiracy palette, but the algorithm doesn’t push his content anymore.
You and Jeffree are amazing! So glad you're back. Love how it's like no time has passed between you two. True friendship is easy no matter the time or distance 🙂
I’m with you.  I’ve shifted over mainly to watching nail art tutorials cuz I’m new to that, and Diamond painting content.  I pretty much only watch Alexandria Ryan, roxxsaurus, and Mia maples from the beauty community now and that’s cuz they don’t focus on beauty anymore, they do other stuff.
Anyone knows the track at 31:11 ? 🙏
These videos are brilliant ! I love seeing Jeffrey again ❤
I love shane and Jeffrey. Haters are jealous and bad blooded people. Die haters die.
I love when people get jealous of shane and Jeffrey being together. Haters will die of jealousy. Love shane
God this made me love them even more. Jeffree needs to rock the short hair. It’s all good. I’m happy for them 😋
Shane blink twice if you are safe. Blink twice if Jeffrey didn't kidnap you
I come home from a hard day at work at the liquor store loosing a half person of weight and talking to ppl all day my hubby even knows i come home watch my favorites to escape my day and just chill sorry u all have to go threw it but know were here when and if u come or go
Please don't ever go this long without seeing eachother
Jeffree looks so healthy happy and amazing 🥰🥰
I wish there was less of Ryland I know you love him but he’s a hard one to watch
As he is talking about flipping his car and almost dying he stops to super charge that whore 😂😂😂
I love Jeffree so much, I'm so damn proud of his improvements and development throughout the years. Watching Shane and Jeffree together always puts a smile on my face, amazing energy 👏
Jeffree needs chickens for his ranch
Oh, so this is the first time I've seen Shane recommended. Interesting how you can do any dispicable shit and be relevant on YouTube still.
Love seeing you guys together and you both look much happier
Jeffrey looks handsome with short hair and no makeup.
SHANE, you’re NOT cancelled and don’t leave us again. YOU and JEFFREE ARE GOLD! ✨✨✨
I hope Jeffery doesn’t stop cause I honestly watch him for his work ethic not his makeup
You can see how much Jeffree has grown thru the years.. I’m so sad he’s gonna quit YouTube.. 💔
She's right about the lack of views on YT. I have millions of views on my old channel. Not  much on my new channel. It's very depressing.
new mandela effect: WASNT THERE TWO R’s IN STAR ????
Sick
Just checked how many views he got on his last videos... ppl are still watching but if u want to stop then stop
Jeff looks different now and I finally figured out why.... He has eyebrows now lol
I had forgotten how much I love jeffree and all the shit he says😂
OMG Jeffrey  looks so good . A paranormal series would be amazing.
Wowww, im on YouTube a lot. I don’t like tik tok lol
I love love love your short hair. It brings out you facial features so beautifully!
To see how far Jeffree has come, and he feels at peace is just beautiful. I will never forget when he was on MySpace and I was like who is this guy he's different and interesting. I enjoyed this post, Shane ❤
Bruh, I haven't seen you in over a decade. The nostalgia is real.
What plant do these people live on. Outer mind , outer space. Food prices are going  up. Jobs are going down. And millions of people are watching Jeffrey . Give me a break.
Why does YouTube got to be over? I’m really over Tiktok. It’s becoming so over saturated that I get bored easily on how hard people are trying. TikTok gives me anxiety these days.
YouTube is my main thing dude
its the i have the name he not gonna eat me
This world may "normalize" LBGQT......THE word of God has never and will never. 💯
I still love YouTube
I want more episode. Can't wait
Jeffree,  You would be so far ahead of the game if you'd just loose those hideous tatts.
I’m loving Jeffree’s growth! He seems so happy! But idk what I’m gonna do if he stops posting on YouTube 😢
Ugh I don’t want him to quit YouTube 😭😞😘
I don't know how this disgusting thumbnail got into my fucking list of things to watch.
YouTube without jeffree is not the same omg…..
Shane and Ryland you are not wasting your time! If you like doing it and feel inpsired it's never a waste. I still get so much joy and comfort from watching both of your videos and am so excited every time I see a new one. I'm so glad to hear that Jeffree is doing what's right for him, but it doesn't mean that youtube SUCKS :)
I disagree. YouTube is not dead. I always look forward to when one of my favorite creators posts. It’s sad to see many YouTube creators feel this way.
I watch you , ry, Jeffrey, and so much more just for fun
You and jeffree are my serotonin ❤❤❤ absolute gold can’t wait for more videos
we hate you both lol
OOHHH Plot twist Jeffree just cancelled Youtube
I know he said he’s happy finally, but the vibe was so weird. He seemed sad.
RELEASE THE PALLETTE
I love you and Jeffree sooo much!!
Loved this💙💙💙
This made me so happy Jeffrey seems so much lighter and he’s so funny. I was smiling the whole time
I love this duo!
shane’s back❤❤
We care!!  I will always watch yours abd your family’s YouTube videos
The backyard = the yakyard
I love youtube. I watch it everyday, Shane i've supported you through it all, all the times you've been cancelled, the breaks, all of it. I still get that excitement when i see you've uploaded. I just think the genre of content that Jeffree produces has died. I feel like the everything you could do with makeup has been done. But there will always be the fans that will love and support you no matter what.
The first five minutes had me so excited and I got goosebumps. Thank you For bringing the series back in a beautiful new way while also capturing the nostalgic feeling you brought us the first time. Literally making my year, cause its heen a brutal one. Keep creating, love to you, Ryland. Chris, Jeffree, Maddie, and the whole team❤

Jeffree really is so fun. Like him doing the Hummers W.T.F mode with you guys, just generally showing y’all such a good time in Wyoming, that’s so nice. Jeffree is just way better when he’s no longer trying to prove himself, and he’s just _being_ himself.
What was the pallette going to be called? 🤔
I gotta agree with Jeffree. YouTube (and mainly social media as a whole) has become a swarm of trying to cancel someone. While me personally I always watch Jeffrees videos, I realized I’m watching not because I’m interested in the products, but because of his personality. However not everyone is like that, and even with this video, other YouTubers already started making videos about The gang, and I can see where jeffree is coming from. What’s the point of doing YouTube when every time you post or do anything, people come for you, make videos about you, or say your being fake ect. However he seems really happy and I hope the best for him.
As part of the “older generation” of YouTube this hits home. It’s kinda true… but Shane and Jeff keep me here. Once they leave, YouTube is done for me.
Thank you guys for being here with us
Hahah "no one watches it its trash" literally 19.5 m people watch him say that in 3 days haha
Jeffree I'm sorry but you're wrong about Youtube. Listen to Mr.Beast. He knows what he's talking about. Your content is just old. Find something cool and new!!!
I still love YouTube..
omg no, i’ve waited so ling for them to be back on youtube 😭
Well I still watch YT. 😂
Omg!! I will die if Jeffrey leaves YouTube. I look forward to his videos. And to see  you to together again gave me goosebumps. You too are amazing together. I love you guys and I'm looking forward to more of of your videos.❤❤
Jeffree looks so hot as a dude omG
So love your series,  whow  just In shock 😲 can't wait tell the next! Shane your so good at this!
Okay so. My only comment about Mr stars YouTube is it just needs a massive f u c k I N g re Hall. It just the same things from before they need to change it up and get a little crazy.
Boring
17:36  the pilot mannequin kinda looks like Jeffrey, if  were overly masculine  Also 20:37  Missouri tags... in Wyoming is kinda of odd
I personally will always love and prefer YouTube over any other platform. Truly it’s part of my every day routine.
'Nobody watches youtube'  Me sitting here five hours deep in to a Youtube session...
So are you telling me that I have to download that stupid a** app TikTok to watch Jeffree Star now or are we never going to see him anymore that's very depressing.
I smiled all the way watching this glad use r back together I’ve missed it
Why do I feel like this is heading to the release of the next palette? What I love the most, is that, no matter how different there lives are since the first series, there friendship is still the same. Love it xx
I know he says nobody clicks and nobody watches anymore, but both of them still get shit tons of views. And they get ad revenue. Maybe they don’t get the easy money from paid partnerships and advertisements, but so many people would kill for the amounts of likes and views they get. A normal person would be able to quit their 9-5 and have a completely different life with the YouTube earnings these two get.
watching this reminded me how much i loved watching youtube. i totally understand jeffree and he’s right. no one watches it. But this video and this content is so genuine and authenticity joyful and entertaining that it makes you re-fall in love with it. I’ve been laughing and smiling at these videos, like i haven’t the past couple months and this brought back that joy and spark inside of me. So thank you shane and ryland and jeffree and chris and all. To go out and have fun with life. Love you guys
Not Elton John 😂😂😂😂
Looove you Jeffrey sorry cuz I wasn’t clicking for a minute but I am BACK NOW KEEP THEM COMING 🤩🍿
U need to release that palette!!!!! Pretty pretty plz
Jeffree's natural (?) eyebrows look so good
That was SO depressing. I just feel old now.
OH and Shane? PLEASE take Jeffree up on that paranormal Wyoming idea! I WANNA SEE THAT!
but like i love chris don’t even get me wrong
Omg please don’t quit YouTube Jeffery 😢
I'm older than 99% of your viewers, Shane, but I can totally understand why Jeffree wants/is quitting youtube. He's gotta take care of himself and if youtube is getting him down, he needs to just stop. I hope YOU don't stop, Shane, or Ryland. I watch youtube every single day. Several times a day. I have my creators that I watch every single thing they put out (including Jeffree) and I can see the writing on the wall...youtube's time is coming. I think it all started with demonetizing just about everyone and it's dropped since then. Anywho...I love Jeffree and I love you, Shane and Ryland. Always. Forever. I never canceled any of you. Love and watch Morgan as well.
I'm so sad Jeffree is quitting YouTube, but he's so happy. I'm glad to see him living his best life.
Jeffree looks really hot 🥵
Well if your nightmares involve falling off a cliff or demons which sounds bad there's meaning behind those kinds of dreams like a warning.
“No one watches YouTube.”  Me: Juggling my phone and food to watch this episode
I love this new series!!! Especially seeing Jeffree as a more relaxed version of what we've seen before.  Its good to see him be his funny, clever, quick-whitted, cracking puns self. ❤️
I love that Jeffree was very educational with gun safety and his farming 🖤🖤🖤
Ok but here I am still tuning in….
Why did I want to cry when jeffree said he's quitting YouTube 😢 😭
Absolutely love when these two are together!!! I laughed so much during the cad ride to his ranch lol
Wow. It really seems like Jeffrey has come down to earth in the best way. I’m cautiously optimistic! Still not there with Shane and Ryland, but I hope they learn and grow too.
i wish more large subscriber talent would tell YT to shove it. if talent supported another site, in unison, YT would just be a neutered yak, if you will.  they have too much power and they take way too much of the ad dollars.  they suck off talent and use them while stealing money. the audience must know their power.  yt should be relegated to old movies and tv shows.  the talent should go where the money is and the freedom.
I’ve actually gotten back into watching YouTube when you came back!
I don’t want Jeffry to stop making YouTube’s but as long as he makes videos with Shane still I’ll be gucci
The end of this made me sooooo sad!😞I knew jeffree star on MySpace😞
I’m really loving this series I do miss Al my YouTubers making YouTube though ❤❤❤
I never thought I would be crying about something like this. I’m devastated, but he is so happy now and thats what he deserves❤️❤️😔😔 we love you jeffree ❤️
Jeffree I know that you don’t know me from Adam but I want you to know I will forever watch your videos. If it’s on YouTube TikTok or instagram I am there. I will always support you and Shane. Forever a fan Melissa from Kansas.
it's amazing to see them both grow together and find each other again, im so glad things are getting better for them
Time to Jenna marbles 😭😂
I'm missing the mystery stuff
I exclusively watch YouTube. I don’t watch anything else.
I absolutely love how supportive Ryland is about everything. Your guys life is so beautiful to watch and I have nothing but love and aspiration for you all. ♥️
This just got depressing for me by the end shit
next episode less context of Maddie just so annoying
150 yaks I LEVELED OUT 🤣 okay yeah you can't hate them
Ok isnt it CRAZY how this video got 1.7 million views in 2 days??!! Are you kidding😂😂😂😂 jeffree may have lost his views I am sohurt him speaking that way. But we still love watch YouTube for entertainment. 🎉🎉 Love you shane ryland jeffree ❤
This was soooo good. I am so so so happy to see Jeffree fully happy and in a safe space mentality in life. The feels from seeing Shane and Jeffree together again is amazing. But it’s also really sad to hear that he’s quitting YouTube. But he’s right, no one watches it the same anymore. I mean, I do. I still go back and watch his old videos. They helped get me through so much in life.
Ok ow though I feel like a huge era of my life that involved jeffree is over now…I mean I’m so happy for his growth but ouf
Jeffree is not wrong. I’ll always love all of my faves, but it’s crazy to see less and less views on everyone’s content. Sad honestly. I really do love him on the clock app though! Shane and Ryland would be fun to watch on there too.. and Morgan!
Haven't finish the video yet, but was the gun real? O.o
I love rylands vlogs and Shane’s series. Don’t give up YouTube 😂 Jeffree star would have more views if he did more personal vlogs. I love his Star ranch videos
Welcome to the farm life.
ok but like did no one see jeffery glich 4.10
I felt so sad at the end when Jeffery was talking about YouTube being dead, I watch my favourite content creators every single day, it helps me get away from reality for a little bit, it’s so nice to see you all back together!❤️
If you dont come out with a new palette and its notncalled cancelled im gonna be mad !
I honestly love how JS finally found what makes JS happy. Not what everyone else wants JS to be.
How can Jeffrey say nobody is watching this has been viewed 1 million times and 11thousand comments
As soon as jeffree said he was done with youtube. I was kinda sad, i mean, ive been watching jeffree and shane and rylands videos for years. Its just something enjoyable to break up the scary haunted videos. But yeah like ryland said, “if it doesnt bring happiness then why do it?”. Obviously jeffree doesnt owe us anything. But its still kind of depressing to see him moving on. Im glad shane and ryland make videos still and im sure that jeffree will be in them periodically, which is great.
Jeffree is so right about YouTube the culture has changed so much with the tiktok wave. It's crazy.
You look good Shane
Ghost hunting series in Wyoming? Please? c:
I wish you didn’t choose to kill animals as a business move 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Excuse me: Jeffree and Shane start a network. I would watch. Thank You. Just a suggestion. Makeup, Conspiracy, Hauntings also Shane write a horror movie. 🤔🤔
https://youtu.be/WfpGsFbG2ho  If you’ve seen this video and are still here supporting Shane Dawson.. there’s something wrong with you.
I love seeing all you together again!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
It’s sad to see Jeffree leaving YouTube. I disagree that YouTube is dying but I think the beauty community side is dying and I’m glad he is moving to something he likes
Jeffrey Star is so fucking smart. Hell of a business man. He will have this success until the day he dies. Nice to see his mental growth and finding a true peace. So much love to him. ❤️ People may hate him, but there's really nothing u can say or do that'll end his very successful life. 🤘 He's impressive.
Jeffree Lynn!! No! I would always watch a video of yours! Girl I been a fan since 2005. I graduated highschool in 2007. I'll always be a fan and of Shane too. The internet can try and cancel you but I'm not falling for that BS anymore. I love you ALL so much! You are so genuine and real, honest, and I love you. always.
"You thought blood sugar was selling bitch" hahaha the tea!¡
Wow…… another masterpiece Shane …. You are so fucking talented .
finally leveled out!!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
creepy! is that a dude or a woman? Either way, its creepy.
SOME OF US ARE STILL HERE!
Youtube sucks? SO what is the point of this documentary? What's the point in shooting a documentary for a platform that you're making clear sucks? lol
Loving this Jeffree
Why are people still supporting you
Good for you Chris for wearing your mask on the plane !! Too many people don't care anymore & think the virus is forever gone.
I really like seeing this part of Jeffree, it just makes him a little more relatable, especially with all the mental health stuff. Just very down to earth and really nice to watch.
I watch YouTube all day every day,it's been over a year since I've watched Any TV or streaming,I love Shane And Rylan! I watch you both and always will,i brought y'all up at the dispensary just a few days ago, before hurricane Nicole,and the people there watch y'all and said how much they love you both!❤️❤️❤️
I think it’s the younger kids who go straight to TikTok and the older people who still come to YouTube. I have a TikTok but I’m only on there once a week maybe. I prefer long form content.
Seems a couple million of us are still here watching :)
i still watch :(
The end part breaks my heart, bc I use to religiously watch Jeffree and Shane every time something new was posted!! I was a YouTube whore for these two and to now have the realization that it is slowly coming to an end makes me feel old and sad!
i'm loving this documentary so far!!!
shane more like shame
I love watching your videos me and the family play it on the TV we all get so excited it would be so empty without you
im sad af thinking no more jeffree  on yt :/
Ok good. Jeffree is quiting YouTube. He is done with the million views he gets. That is no one. So can we be done making videos about him? I don't think you can think up any more stupid titles with his name tagged on. You should make the next one The stupid world of Jeffree Star.
Wow the pos making a video about the pos
Wait I thought he his Gucci’s to the gym because he didn’t like them, but he wears them ONLY to the gym to keep the in good shape 😢
Wow I just looked at the views from the last few years and Jeffree is right there are only a few of us now.
I'll honestly will never get bored of watching you guys!!! Thank you for sharing this with us all. I've loved & adored you both from the start of your careers & loved watching you both grow into who you you guys are now 💜🖤
Nooooooo not quitting YouTube 😭 I love his content
NOOOO I disagree with Jeffree... SHANE AND RYLAND, I LOVE WATCHING THE WEEKLY VLOGS. PLEASE DON'T STOP!!!! Seriously my favorite part of the week and Morgan's videos too!! 💛
What he said about "no one" watching youtube isn't true. He repeated it so many times. Said "youtube sucks." I think the truth is that HIS views are lower, and he's projecting that onto everyone else.
I love it and you guys so much.   ❤
Came to watch the video and am here now as well for those sheets.  Sleeping next to my husband… some mornings I forget I no longer am in that waterbed I had in high school and panic for a split second because I think the bed has sprung a leak.  😂
Shane!!! You better stay on Youtube!! Pleaaaaaassseeee
When is Jeffree going to learn to fly and get his own helicopter?
I’m so happy to see shane active again. 😊
What’s the song at the end of the video?
Omgggggggh yay! So excited about this series!!💕💛
Shane you should do a conspiracy video about DIA. I would love to hear your take on everything
Eyackly 😂
So glad both of them left the CA toxicity ✨
Flirts from toxemia-ville....... Mooches with an SSSSSS$
Only fans! Porn! Billion dollar buisness! I am kidding!
Hearing that Jeffree is longer gonna be on Youtube makes me so sad but Im glad that you're still gonna be using this platform!
Say hi to Chris everybody! He is behind the video cam! camming! 🤗 🤗
😂 😂 Jeffrey! exhausting game!
Not me crying at all the clips from the first series😭 I love them together & cant wait for parts 2&3. I think a lot of people could come to the conclusion that Jefree was done with YouTube, once Wyoming came into the picture. He seems like hes so calm and really found where he needed to be. Not that anyone's opinions matter, but it seems like they've both reflected on themselves the last two years and have come out better people in the long run. The ones who have been here since the beginning are still here, we'll never forget the memories you've shown us & we will always cherish you guys as content creators.❤
How does jeffrey go from SUPER rich to a deserted house in whyoming. Something else is going on. What is it.¿??
Need to put some in your home where the pool table is! Great stress release besides sex! ☺😁😚😋😛🤭🤫🤐
Jeffree looks so good. I'm so happy for him. 🖤
Views might be down for some creators, but I promise you there are still plenty of us here that enjoy this type of content!! I look forward to these docuseries and will continue to watch! I still open Youtube every day, I watch most of Jeffree's videos too. I'm not going anywhere!
A lot! me too Shane!
What did he say about Texas?!?! 🤨🤨🤨
It’s sad for the people who grew up watching jeffery and shane, being on their journey from day 1 watching; supporting and now to just give up and say we never cared is just sad and breaks my heart. makes me think jeffery ever cared about his viewers in the first place if he said that. but i’ll always love and support, do what makes you happy.
49:25 I am in that toxic state of mine! It is very dangerous to stay too long in that state of mine! How do you juggle taking medications and still having a loving sexual relationship, Shane? Please tell me the blue pill!
Idk if it’s the eyebrows but Jeffree looks like he has more emotion now 😂 it’s nice to see you all back together finally something to watch
It will be sad to say goodbye to Jeffrey His reveal videos helped me with a very difficult time in my life when I felt down and alone. I do understand also how tired he must be to be misunderstood and always judged....
Omgggg we need a haunted series in Wyoming!!!!
PLEASE MAKE THAT PALLET 😮 BEGGING YOU!!!!
This video trending lol 🤣 and the message of is that YT sucks ... JS is a business man, he knows where the  money at and it ain't here I guess
The duo I never knew I missed so much… 🤍
😂 😂 taco bell TikTok video re: Jeff
Can we get a pallet called CANCELED???
i dont know what Jeffree is talking about. I  still use Youtube all day everyday. It just depends on the type of content you're making. But either way, if its not bringing you joy then there are plenty of other things out there to do that will bring you happiness and benefit your life.  I haven't watched a Shane video in ages. Only because of his drama and his content was repetitive. This seemed interesting as I thought Shane and Jeffree weren't even friends anymore. So interesting that Jeffree is like a mature adult now.
❤️❤️❤️
PLEASE do a series on the Appalachians
Not me watching youtube for enjoyment and fun
I like  old conspiracy theory videos from this chanel
So happy to see Jeffree and Shane together again! Awesome series, Shane! Can't wait for part three. 💙
ok not Jeffree trying to hit the bug with an ELECTRIC swatter on the METAL sink
Jeffree is always a good entertainer, no one can take that from him !
just noticed millie (stranger things) and jeffree look similar lmaoo
Damn 1 million views in 2 days. A few years ago that would’ve been 20 million
👛👜👝🛍💰$300,000 wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for 1
TRENDING!!!!❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Also I don’t think YouTube or Jeffrey or Shane or anyone for that matter is the problem. Times are changing and tiktok was created in order to grasp the attention of someone in seconds. People don’t have the attention span that they use to in order to watch long videos. Scary but the world is changing.
I hate tik tok. It's early for the generations who have a 10 second attention span. I want to watch reveals. I want to watch reviews on makeup. These 30 sec or 1 min long videos ain't it sis.  Also, I am 1000% on board with Jeffree's motto for the year... "So..???" 😒 Legit how I am living this year!!
I would be nervous driving by Bluecifer! I’m happy to see you guys together again 😊
The look on your face Shane when Jeff brought out the gun with a silencer! Priceless!!!
Damn... so sad. I'm here for more vlog style vids from Jeffree and Shane... I love Jeffrees attitude and vibes. I always watch his videos.
😭I have to come home to Cali! My life is there! There is nothing & no one in Miami here for me! Culture very different here!
girlie garb
Damn Shane ! I did not know you get so white-knuckled when flying!
The moment Jeffree walked into the airport my heart started smiling big! ❤
11:04 Protect your joints! I do it all the time! I never leave the house without one 🪔😂 😂 Happy Thanksgiving you guys! 🤗 🤗.
I like how Jeffrey’s gun just has a huge silencer on the top😅😳😂
1.7 million views in 2 days! Way to go Shane!
YouTube is dead… Shane and Jeffree get 1.2m views in 2 days. I think people just got tired of the constant drama not the platform. It makes my heart happy to see you guys doing so well after social media literally came for your throats.
Nooo I love Jeffery and Shane I stuck with them even when they got canceled I never canceled them but awwwwww 🥺
Shane just acting shocked to see anything like always lol
okay yes im commenting a second time i feel tension with ryland and the camera and jeffree and shane like the man spoke once didnt finish got voiced over okay when they were outside ryland was on the floor with the dogs he only spoke once in the car like jeffree is trying to include everyone we love that but like is it just me or is it noticeable???
Jeffree is right, he know where to put his time and he see clear even if it’s hard to hear  He is a business man, business man do business move, not emotion moves
I am so happy to see you guys back together and overcoming those insane times <3
I’m so late. But I love watching as Shane grows into the person he is today through the years it took to build this series.
I’m am NOT here for the downfall of YouTube, I will rewatch every video on here to kid myself if I have too, it will always be my happiest place 🖤😢
GHOST HUNTING WITH JEFREEEEEE
Just got through watching with my son Michael and tears are about to fall due to hearing Jeffrey going to no longer be on youtube. Keeping up with Shane and Jeffrey on here has always be a son and mother time because we love you all so much. I want to say thank you Shane and Jeffery for sharing your lives with us and I always said told my son that if I ever got my make up done by anyone I would love to have Jeffery so it. Even though I know our life paths take us down separate roads I pray and wish you all nothing but the very best. Love and kisses from Eastern Kentucky.
I actually really enjoyed this, can't wait for part 2 and 3
No cus when I was younger I never thought about this… but who tops who lmao
Anyone else agree that this is Jeffree’s most attractive form? Just living life ❤
After the cancellation debacle I unfollowed Jeffree but after seeing this side of him just seemingly grounded is so refreshing. I think the world needed to see this not just for his reputation because who cares lol but just to see this side of him NOW, who he really is and the things he’s excited for that aren’t material.
not the silencer on the pistol
the end of a cycle
Does someone know the song in minute 51.47 cant find it haha
... okay I love Jeffery again. Idgaf
Shane! I love what you are doing. I cannot wait for the next part 👏 I feel I need more, like NOW. Hahaha. I guess I just have to be a little patient 😅 Thank you for the amazing job you do because I can tell that everything you do, it is made with love (even the tinniest details) 💖
Jeffree Star will always be a brilliant self-made entrepreneur, rare, gorgeous, dazzling Star to me.. Loves and Hugs Jeffree, You were at the right place, at the right time for that incredible unforgettable moment in your life.. You know what's up though, you're truly are smart and I love how when you know what you want to do and "make-up" your mind to do it and you actually do it.. that is solid gold mentality and a doer gets hella far in life and straight boss level status. You got this 🤟🏼💗💜💗🤟🏼👩🏻‍🎤🤟🏼💗💜💗🤟🏼
Please never quit YouTube!!!
YouTube is clearly dying 2023
Wow. This was insane
Who says no one watches anymore. We love watching you guys!
i would literally watch shane and jeffree do anything , idc i would watch anything that has this golden duo <3 please don't quit! we're still here!
I still watch… YouTube
I do love this side of jeffree but I also really love how you and him are together! He is so comfy and real w you!
Yesssd I’m so excited!!
I’m so glad to see Jeffree is doing better. He’s shining! I remember being pissed when he canceled his meet & greet in Amsterdam twice some years ago, but seeing this makes me happy for him because he’s chosing for his own peace and happiness. True inspiration!
Jeffrey humble is fun and Im loving it. All of it
I love this
I NEEED. A Scorpio and cancer palette
OMG Jeffree has gotten HOT AS HELL!!!! Dang
This documentary clearly put the fun back into Jeffrey as a person. This is the best documentary I’ve seen by far
Shane! Please never stop creating! ❤❤❤
I just orderd 3 jeffree star pallets for my mams xmas stocking because she used my conspiracy pallet and loved it 😍
YES! I needed Shane & Jeffree in my life xoxo ❤️❤️
I knew Jeffree could be funny but now he really seems happy and is a lot funnier.
Dang… Jeffrey is kind of right! But I love you Shane! I will always watch your videos! They are amazing! And very interesting. I love Jeffery and I am Sad that he is leaving :/
Eww
Totally feel Jeffery, like in the end of the day or world, it always you and yourself that be with you at the time. Thanks Shane for unfold the update of his life. Love and support
This video is amazing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo89I0mabuM
Jeffrey seems more fun and humorous
:( I love watching his collection reveals and makeup reviews 😢😢😢😢
You’re the reason I go to Youtube.
Wouldn’t say it’s a series… it’s a vlog
Oh so you offended Christy. I only that the feedback you, Ryland and Jeffrey should consider with things you want to do next year. The fans that stay will give you feedback NOT backlash
SHANE JEFFREE WE LOVE YOU
I'm so sad I always get home and watch YouTube after work it's still a safe space and comfortable without jefree it's gonna be weird
i love how they both changed. although its kinda sad how jeffree is going to leave youtube. despite all the drama i still love them though anyways whatever makes them happy <3
I love youtube & its my number 1 platform. I don't use tik tok at all. I go to YouTube before i turn on the tv lol. The tv is honestly used by my kids mostly.
Shane & Jeffery are literally two of my favorite humans EVER!!! So kind, funny, hard working, ambitious, and of course HILARIOUS!! I could watch y’all all day everyday! ❤
speaking 4 myself, i definitely enjoy YT on the daily
Omg please go ghost hunting or whatever together! That would be so fun, and exciting to see
I've really missed Shane and Jeffrees day to day adventures like this, but totally get why Jeffree has stripped back how much he shares online
Jeffrey I bet if you did more vlogs (daily life shit) you'd get more views.
21:45 but why does he need a silencer?
Keep the video tending!!!!
This has nothing to do with anything but the way I knew what hotel y'all were at before i even saw the doors.. 😂 weird to see my little hometown on such a large scale
I wish they didn't get rid of dislikes. I cannot believe that people just forgot all about what he did. It wasn't just past "drama" he's a p3d0.
I’m sad. 😢Great video Shane. I’m clicking Jeffree 😞
I’ll always love watching these videos. This brings me back to watching them the first time with all my friends. I still love my conspiracy pallete. Always gonna support you guys!❤❤
How do either of you still have fans? It's fucking baffling.
ALSO I know I’m not alone in thinking way preferring YouTube to tiktok!!
So now we all know where Jeffree lives! 😂
21:43 the most Jeff thing ever LOLOL
I am so happy your back making video documentaries. I have watched all your old videos multiple times. The key to making really good video is doing what makes you happy and what is interesting to you. Keep up the good work and I'm looking forward to the next video.  🤠 🇦🇺 🐨✌️
Something about Shane’s voice makes me feel very nostalgic 🥹❤️ Takes me back to pre Covid and being young and I love it xxx
I still use my palette all the time!
I know this is completely off topic, but I love Chris and the fact you can tell he's an animal lover! First thing I would want to do, too, is pet the yaks!
Makes me so so upset when I come to YouTube now and I'm like what is going on where are all the usual people I watch and love? So I have to go back through my subscriber list just to find they haven't posted for a year or two years with no explanation. I feel a lot of hurt from people abandoning the platform that put them where they are with no explanation and I get people need a break and sometimes enough is enough (Jenna Marbles) but do they not understand what they mean to their subscribers? Like fuck, no wonder I've got abandonment issues.
I mean its sad that Jeffree is leaving youtube I grew up watching him and he gave me so much confidence. And I mean clicks aren't everything I still like the youtube bcs here you can tell your story while you really can't do that in a one minute video.
This Jeffree is such a mood!! I’m obsessed with him!
I might join tiktok to watch him now i love Jeffree
I don't know why I'm so sad that Jeffree is leaving.. I get it but I also don't. He was talking about showing us everything about the ranch, vlogs etc and now just poof?
My sister lived in Casper Wyoming and every time I visited I would hope to see Jeffree out and about lol. I never did but I wish I would have.
People who want to escape everyday life watch these series.. really interesting and you leave world outside
YESSSS
"oh hahaha a gun" what a piece of shit
Idk how but Jeffree became attractive to me as a man in this video. Before I saw him as a sort of mogul deity thats untouchable. Now he has an aura thats more approachable as a stranger
Omfg I’d be obsessed with Shane and Jeffree ghost hunting 😮😍😍
There’s still people on YouTube it’s just now the content has to be up there and interesting. For makeup related yes it’s not the same as years ago when it was hyped. I think Jeffrey should explore other different types of content but if he’s honestly tired of it in general then that’s fine he’s been on here for soo many years. But for you Shane you better not leave.
needed this
YouTube isn’t dead. Us millennials still like watching long videos lol
You Tube sucks - but we are all here watching. I guess we are the nobody’s. 😮
Hey Jeffery , if you sell a bag or two , you could actually LITERALLY help me and my husband and kids buy our first and forever home. Just saying lol 😂 😅😢
Shane with a gun looks like a confused assassin lmao like “wait who do you want me to kill?”😂😂😂
Was that gun off the safety? Or am i dumb
I hope this doesn’t give Shane an idea too. Please don’t leave us 😭. I always watch your videos 🥺 and I’m so so glad you’re back. I’m still watching so many creators I’ve watched years ago already like Markiplier, Jacksepticeye and Mykie and a few others. I kinda agree though I’ve watched Jeffrees content in the past a lot more. Make up palettes aren’t as popular as it was in a few years ago I think. But if he would do a ghost hunting video in Wyoming this would be amazing 😍.
I truly have hope that the youth and the entire world will be moving more in this direction... Realness. Living through your eyes, not through a lens. Being in a moment, not watching it on a phone. Enjoying nature and protecting nature. Love for life, not things. But... also enjoying a FEW prized, USEFUL possessions. 😊 Finding peace in your heart and not worrying about others judgment. Etc etc etc. ❤️
I still watch youtube 😢
“What? That im quitting youtube”   When i tell you IM SOBBING RN No joke. 😢
It's Showtime!
YouTube is the best. Tiktok is terrible for this new generation.  Please stay on YouTube Shane and Jeffree. I constantly watch YouTube.  I love long form content. Us millenials need you <3
It makes complete sense for Jeffrey to quit YouTube because he has his own company making him millions and now this other Yack business, he has other means of promoting his product and none wants to watch his videos. But Shade and Ryland are a complete different story. People love to watch your life, you are like the family and friends that people have and for some maybe the only connection, it is so important for you to keep making YouTube videos.
Anyone know the song that plays second to last
How on earth did I miss this!!!!!?? I saw the link on Insta, clicked it and wow, I can't believe I missed this video.I love you both so I'll be watching the video pronto!!!!
Personally I love YouTube and 9/10 I come here for entertainment than a streaming service.
That was heartbreaking to hear that Jeffree is done with YouTube 😢 he was the reason I started watch YouTube
Jeffrey & Shane:  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE DO A HAUNTED WYOMING SERIES!!!!!
im still clicking and watching
I can’t wait for part three. I love this side of jeffree- I hope one day to reach that level of true peace and happiness in life. I’d LOVE to see a ghost hunting/paranormal activity series in Wyoming with Jeffree. It’s some of my favorite content to watch. Love this ❤️❤️❤️
DISAGREE with Jeffree 100%. This platform is alive and well. I'm on here alllllll the time. I need this platform to stick around. Long form content is my shit! I need it
loving the series shane <3 i’ve been hoping for new content from you for so long, happy to see you back :) it’s so relaxing to just sit down and watch your videos like old times
I’m still watching YouTube and I hate tik tok
This video is great, love the editing, beautiful images.. I don't agree with Jeffree, I watch Youtube everyday, Im not the only one !, It will be very sad if Jeffree would stop his channel...
From a business perspective I can totally understand where Jeffree is coming from with quitting YouTube. But man I wish he'd still do reviews and stuff for fun. He still brings in like over a million views per video.
Jeffree I love you but please don't murder animals, the world is not going there anymore❤️❤️❤️
Please do spooky content with with Ryland, Jeffree, Morgan and their mom as well!
As a Texan he’s living my dream. This is real living I want my own Ranch
I've missed these types of videos so much I truly love your content!!!!
I know Wyoming has dinosaurs when I drove through it because the scenery looks like the dinosaur movies 😭
Oh my God these documentaries are so good they should be on Netflix. This episode was very touching, and sentimental. It personally brought me back to a certain time in my life. During that time I was so excited about makeup, and you guys were coming out with your palette. I’ve been through a lot of changes since then, and watching this video transported me right back to that time. Please keep making great videos like these, and I can’t wait for the next part to come out 🖤
Chris is my inner voice when Shane said he wears the Gucci shoes to the gym 😂😂😂
So great to see you all back together again.
No don't quit YouTube!!!!😭😭😭
Mr. Star looks so comfy around y'all and it's so nice to see.
i still watch you tube more than other platforms
Um I still like youtube...... and I don't like tik tok....
YouTube over tiktok. 👍🏻
Jeffrees energy has done a full 180!! Definitely more grounded and at peace! Happy for him!
Why can’t he just go away? Shane is so gross
I still love youtube... i hope it never dies out :(
Jeffree please don't leave youtube!!! You are breaking my heart.
Icon
omg, i was laughing all the video to the moment when Jeffree said he is quitting youtube, now i`m literally crying  😢
I will miss jeffree on YouTube 😢
$300,000 I know I saw someone else with that bag 😲😲😲
Love this so much. I forgot much much I need the cremated palett. It’s so pretty but I just can’t afford her. Actually I have problems affording anything expensive these days. But pop off sis. Still love Jeffree and Shane 😊
Hey!! I love watching YouTube still! Especially Shane and rylands videos. Please don’t stop creating 💜
No one can beat Shane when it comes to docu series honestly!
i mean Jeffree still gets upwards of a million views on most current videos.. that's still nothing to sneeze at. Like he explained, he has a fixation of going "big" which means you always have to be relevant and move with the trends. I believe that's part of what makes him happy and he's learning to separate the materialistic part of being trending.
… literal me still clicking and watching YouTube haha
All I could think is what if you had an emergency and you live in the middle of nowhere. My anxiety could never lol
Jeffree you’re literally the only YouTuber I watch religiously as soon as you upload. You can’t do this to us 😭. But as a fan I’d support any decision you’d make for your own good. ❤
I love YouTube
Cancelled pallette hopefully you guys trademark it before someone else gets the idea from this
Real clips of Casper would have been cool at that one part….there ain’t no Ben N Jerry’s here, I wish.
I love Jeffree obvs Shane too but I still want his content!
I get it but where do we follow Jeffree???
Aww I love how they immediately went back to the friendship they had 4 years ago we all have that friend no matter how long we are away from each other when we see each other again for the first time it's like we never had a day apart
I’ve been a fan of Jeffree since 2014, & seeing him this happy & very well relaxed makes me so happy for him! He went through a lot of tough situations, creating make up, & putting up with bs that he deserves to be in this peaceful, happy environment he’s in. I’m so proud of him, & of course I’ll miss him dearly. ❤️  But, he’s right :( YouTube is somewhat dead. All the good people that I love watching is already gone from this app
No matter how much YouTube changes, I will always look forward to your video series.
Great to see how much they appreciate their viewer what a slap in the face! YouTube sucks who do you tuning bought all those products!
Another hour of almost nothing. This whole series could have been done by now.
I get what Jeffree is saying, but... we're literally watching him say no one watches YouTube, ON YouTube lol
SHANE if ur sweating THAT much every night it can be serious please have a doctor test you♡ not going to say all the possibilities but my ex used to have this prob and I don't wanna scare you but just go to the doctor and Get a blood test don't jump to conclusions its most likely something normal but pls if its rlly bad actually get yourself tested♡♡♡♡♡ night sweats and addiction to sugar can be key signs of cancer, I don't want to scare you but better to be safe than sorry, I'm sure ur fine just pls be proactive with ur health
i wanna say. i still love youtube. i still watch youtube all the time. i plop down everyday and watch shane, ryland, jeffree, and like 5 others religiously. i still need youtube, but i agree with what jeffree said. the pandemic ruined youtube.
I actually love YouTube. I watch it in the shower, I watch it before bed, I watch it in the morning. It sucks watching everyone leave because they think TikTok is the only platform.
Still love YouTube, found some great channels that are like families 💗
I don't mind tik tok but I LOVE Youtube and will always gravitate towards this platform. I hope all my favs stay on here.
Flight number had a 66 like Scorpio 😋
YouTube is my TV
stop uploading please
I guess Jeffree is kinda right. I come to YouTube daily for true crime and Shane’s podcast when it comes out but I’m not watching beauty YouTube as much anymore. I only watch beauty when it’s Jaclyn Hill or if I have no new true crime videos to watch. I hate to see him go but it seems like he’s going to be much happier without making content for YouTube, whereas I think Shane gets so much joy from making content for YouTube and he still has so many things he can do. I hope Shane stays on here forever.
WE WANT JEFFREE ON THE PODCAST!!!
I am sorry and I hate to say this but Ryland gets on my nerves. He is the same basic gold digger.
I wish I was important enough to have a series with you, maybe one day 😂 you’re so fucking good at what you do. Been here since day 1 and never left
Completely missed the opportunity to call his arcade the "Starcade"
Never thought I’d see Jeffree Star teaching Shane Dawson gun safety 🤣 LOVE IT
I still watch jeffree star and enjoy his YouTube videos. It will be seriously disheartening when he stops posting. 💔
Shane, that was a great video!
I think the older generation still looks forward to watching YouTube. Vs TikTok I honestly hate TikTok
The arcade should be called "The Starcade"
Jeffree actually looked like an attractive manly man in the kitchen for a bit circa 38:45. (Inspite of the pink hat)That was fun to see.
Gonna miss Jeffree on YouTube 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Next
You should go look at The Hoof GP, to see how popular agriculture is on You tube. 25 plus million followers. Jeffree might be onto the next big thing with Yaks.
ryland saying "you went shopping?" i can't tell if he was proud shane or upset he went without him haha
I am Mesmerized. I have Loved Jeffree since I first discovered him in 2018. I know, late to the show. I'm 60 Damn years old FFS! I find you all together so entertaining. I now live in Billings Montana myself since October 2019. We never got hit hard by the Pandemic because of our location. I moved here from an area in Wisconsin that was devastated by Covid. I'd probably be Dead if I hadn't moved as I am Diabetic, have Heart Failure and COPD. I just got Lucky. This part of the Country is stunning and we all live here now. I spent some time in Denver and Fort Collins CO and fell in Love with the State. I only drove thru Wyoming but Beautiful as well.  I hope all of you are Happy and Healthy. I will look forward to more episodes. The last Series was Fabulous.  Hugs and Kisses
So does Jeffree own the mineral rights too or is it just the land? Honest question coming from the country.
Jeffree quitting YouTube is genuinely so upsetting to hear. I had covid back in January, and I rewatched all of his old videos, and they were the thing that got me through that. Just wish he would stay around making contact for the people that do still watch.
I love the new Jeffree. He’s a conservative now. God, Guns, and Country as we say in Texas. 🎉
If this does not end with the launch of a new palette I'll cry 😭🤣❤️ also YouTube is NOT dead, Shane please don't go away!!!
jeffrees eyebrows look so fucking good  so happy they got back together!!
This is the first time in a long time I’ve watched a video on YouTube. I watch a few here and there but not like i used too. This reminded me of the old days. Jeffree is absolutely right. I used to watch makeup videos all night long. Now i cant remember the last time i did. I’m glad you’re looking so healthy mentally jeffree. And Shane you and Ry are so cute. Thanks so much for doing this video together guys!!! I think i need to go live like jeffree lol
I love YouTube and all your videos! Don’t stop!
I'm so happy for Jeffrey ☺️
YouTube is dead. As I’m still watching tons of content on YouTube. Awkward. 😅
Of course this new season had to be on scorpio season 🥰😍
Ummm…. I still enjoy scrolling through on the “Tube”,Jeffree!!  Can’t believe my palette is 4yo now… ohh well…. Wear that theory every day!!
Jeffrey blaming not getting views on the pandemic is a joke lol
I am so sad and shocked about Jeffree quitting YouTube !! My obsession on YouTube starts from Jeffree’s reviews and videos !!! NO WAY !! This is my religion and my daily rituals !! No way !! 😢😢😢
I still love YouTube. Just not huge into makeup anymore
Just casually have a gun at the airport
Okay, but Chris saying “they’re sooooo cute” at the dogs every time he saw one was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen 🥹🥹😭😭
I love Jefrees new life
I love this Jeffrey
I actually teared up when Jeffree star was talking about leaving YouTube. We’ve lost to Jenna Marbles, and Ryan Higa… it sucks.    But I would rather he be happy.
I came hete to if anything had changed in the last few months. But no, I just wasted my 55min. Thanks Shame D
So wait, did he just show his pallet in b&w?
I watch his stuff and your stuff Shane do I don’t know why he’s saying that!
good for Jeffree, he found peace
Wow though all those pallets I remember when I could name every pallet
I literally started crying when Jeffree said he was quitting YouTube. I literally watch YouTube every single day of my life, and have watched both Jeffree and Shane for so long. Im so sad to see that  my fav YouTubers are all slowly going away.
Love you Shane 🥰
First thing he does in the video is shove ads down ur throat
This is wverythingggg, my emotions are all over the place. I’m laughing, reminiscing, crying. Missed this type of content!
jeffery is honestly so genuinely funny
This new Jeffree era is so nothing more than Iconic
I love Jeffree’s videos I still watch them I wish he wouldn’t leave it
I loved seeing how humble Jeffree is but still having the humour 🥰😂 I would love to see you guys do Ghost hunts in the area😂 would be fun for sure. Missed seeing you guys all together
How the hell is this dawson still relevant???  Been like 6 years since this guy even crossed my mind. Feckin hell
How the hell is this dawson still relevant???  Been like 6 years since this guy even crossed my mind. Feckin hell
I just want to be Jeffree's dog sitter 😂 I'm being so serious. It's my job anyways.
Hun I adore y'all but, the yak eating is unsettling. You are amazing and l enjoy your family videos .  Please let the past be behind you. You are so sweet and kind. I like Jeffrey but you are so different from him. Congratulations on your Alpaca family!
Im honestly falling in love with jeffree. He deserves peace. And he seems so much happier. I’m gonna cry 😭
Oop. Me clicking every morning, night, and lunch break.  Sad that the Shane Dawson podcast is only once a month bc I want to watch it more often.  Sad that Jenna is gone.  About to google how long before part 2 of this comes out.  I watch Colleen’s vlog every day.  Added Brad Mondo into my rotation bc I needed a new YouTuber in my lineup. 😂   However, I will say I don’t watch makeup tutorials anymore. Unless it’s Ariana with REM and only bc I Stan  So we are still out here!!! Youtube is my primary source of entertainment! (But also I’m a millennial so maybe we are getting phased out.)
We still love you 😊
Noooo Jeffrey
The new pallete is called  . .   Canceled
I love seeing you and Jeffree together filming it's so awesome. I watch you, Jeffree, ryland  and Morgan every chance I get. I Can't wait to see next week's video. Much love to y'all 💜
Loved this, and also Jeffree pulling that gun with a silencer out of nowhere was everything lmao. 😂❤️
Guys! I SPEND ALL MY TIME ON YOUTUBE. We still need you, at least every once in a while. Xx   Do what makes you happy, BUT we still love you and love to see you.
I watch YouTube soooo much, all day every day!
this just made my day
What a pair of shysters 😂
Why didn’t you guys just drive down lol it’s like 5 hours
Loving this. Missed watching you🥹
The conspiracy launch was a moment in my life I'll never forget. As a former "M" 👎 employee, it was absolutely incredible how many people came out to support the launch. Jeffree was and is so iconic. I'm sad to see him go, but so happy he found peace of mind. And f*ck cancel culture. Yaall never deserved it.
me who loves YouTube just like 🧍🏻‍♀️
Ending on that note with 20k views and 10k comments 2 days later and that's LOW comparatively. Dang. She right. RIP YouTube, gonna ride this ship till the last life boat sets. Sad.
I love how everyone forgot about all the videos and nasty shit he did y’all muthafuckers all weirdos loving Two alleged“ pedos. Smh
I still love me some Jeffrey and Shane since the first time they linked up.
Since Jenna and Shane left and JS left  YouTube has not been the same All the OG makeup gurus have kids and don’t have time to make content and are just on instagram and TikTok I only come here for Philip DeFranco and the sorry girls and Rachel Metz. No one else is interesting or seem real Especially the family channels. They all are horrible parents The only true ones are the shaytards Forever love Shane and JS  Long live Jenna Marbles!
This was awful
the stranger things pin ball machine >>
I only watch yall on here
Wow, what a waste of time.
Omgosh please go ghost hunting with Jeffery lol iconic!
I’m so happy for Jeffree and Shane, they have came a long way. I don’t blame Jeffree for leaving Youtube! YouTube has not been the same… I miss OG YouTube!
Damn we really are growing up huh 💀
I think a flaming dude in makeup has worn out his welcome. Don't care if someone is gay. But the entire focus is flamboyance. If he spoke on chemistry,or history,geology, medical care, or subjects  that matter more than his narcissistic self promotion and exploitation,he might have relevance.
Blaming low viewer count on anything other than your own behavior is insulting. You both did bad stuff. You both didn't take actual responsibility for it. You both didn't change your behavior.  And people see thru it. It's not our fault. ITS YOURS.
Jeffree's right.. YouTube sucks.. not what it used to be.. and yet.. I always come back looking for all of you 🥺
Ugh I'd love to escape to Wyoming
I LOVE UTUBE 🥰❤️ over every other platform 👌🏻😌 just saying
I'm so sad :(
Makes me so happy that Jeffrey is living his best life drama free! He deserve it , also thank you Shane for your hard work!!  I love this new series!!
Honestly I love this so much...seeing Jeffree and Shane together again was just the greatest thing ever..I missed this
Freedom!!!
How do you still have fans
Damn this actually made me so sad! I’ve watched Jeffree since I was an emo kid like what 15years ago?? And at the beginning of this video I was so happy seeing them together again and now the ending 😢 Like as a business owner first I totally get his point of view but for long term fans to whom YT is not just content this is so sad
Jeffree looks amazing. So peaceful and humble. I just love this new version of him. Can't wait for part 3.  Anyway, I still hope he won't leave forever this platform. Cuz u know, someone watches and someone loves the content. He's my fav youtuber cuz of his humour and brutally honest make up reviews. So Jeffree don't leave, take a break but don't leave. <33
He has a million views on his most recent videos so wtf is he talking about??
NOOOO I LOVE JEFFREE DONT LEAVE YOUTUBE
Don't get me wrong, I love watching movies and tv shows on streaming services other than YouTube, but coming onto to YouTube to watch people like yourself and Jeffree is, as weird as it sounds, like a refreshing wash over my brain haha. It's so enjoyable to watch what you guys make. I grew up watching people like you guys, it's sad to see that people like Jeffree feel that it's time to hang up the hat, but it's understandable
Oh nooo 😢 not Jeffree leaving! I so love his sense of humor, his whole personality and everything. This is so sad!!!
I was waiting for this for soooo long just to find out it's maybe the last series 😢 my heart is broken.. I'm not an OG and still hurts... I'm so happy for Jeffree finally being in a good place but I'll miss him so much, YouTube won't be the same without him
Wow. You’re so right Shane.. so many questions! I’m excited to see more videos from me and I hope Jeffree leaving YouTube doesn’t deter you away from it as well You’re the only YouTuber I watch anymore and that’s because you’re videos are elite! I love you💙🥹
I still watch!! I refuse to download TikTok, it's a time suck, I watch my husband lose 3 to 5 hours a day to that app, no thanks! Please don't leave forever Jeffree, I thoroughly enjoy yours, Shane and Ryland's content!
I live for Jeffree doing Wyoming PR!
I wish you did more current conspiracy theories!! I loved your old content !  I understand doing YouTube rules but I miss you’re conspiracy’s so so much !!!
“This feels like rehab” 😂
Definitely will miss Jeffree's videos
IM WATCHING! ME! ME! I’m always looking for your newest podcast videos and series. I even find myself rewatching your old spooky videos just for comfort ❤😊 It’s crazy to look back and realize I was watching your videos when I was single and running the world. Many moons later, I’m STILL watching your videos but with 3 kids, a husband, and 2 furbabies. Do whatever makes you happy Shane but always know we are always here to support! 🙂
Maybe Jeffree should start a podcast
NOT TRUE I still love YouTube 😢😢 it’s the only thing I watch I can’t watch Netflix or Hulu those platforms are boring to me because it’s all scripted and fake I prefer YouTube because it feels more real and authentic
Honestly all I need is Shane and Jeffree content
I still go home and watch youtube :) ....and tiktok
This is the most insane video… idk how to even react but I love it 🥹
Its the silencer for me iconic ..lol.  and what was the deal with the Georgia college football flag flying in the shot in downtown
If it means anything, YouTube is my main form of watching things above Netflix, Disney plus, paramount etc - it makes me sad that creators who have a passion for their projects are turning away from them thinking people aren't interested and dont care 😣🥺
Shane please DON’T follow in on Jeffrey’s footsteps and leave YT!  Please don’t leave!  I’m sad Jeffrey’s leaving too but can’t lose you both
He is right about  youtube, I use ti watch YouTube all the TIME. watching vlogs, everything.  Now it's just boring and not the same,I'll watch it here and there. But not all the time like I use to
This broke my heart but Jeffree is speaking fact. I keep hearing people say the beauty community is dead and and drama killed it. Wrong! The beauty community is dead on youtube and youtube shameful and tiring algorithm killed it. Because the beauty community is very popular on Tik Tok. You don't have to be in some petty beef, talking about some DRAMA, buying the latest palette, and finding some way and some how to stretch a video to 10 minutes so the algorithm gods will hopefully pass favor on you. Tik Tok allows you to live in the moment. It allows you to be creative. Remember those days Youtube? I understand Jeffree Star feeling. Why should he keep slaving for a platform that can't even send the people who are SUBSCRIBED to his channel his uploaded videos? Hate him or love him there are still at least 15 million people who f*@ked with Jeffree ( his subscribers) and it makes no sense the his views don't reflect that. Unfortunately this isn't an isolated issue. Youtubers are being screwed over. Big and small.
SHANE UR VIDEOS MAKE MY DAY! :) Don’t quit! We love you!
Jeffrey should sell Yak yarn 🧶
But like can we actually get that pallete lmao
Honestly no one watches beauty content like they used to BUT if Jeffery did Yak Ranch Vlogs they’d watch! We just don’t want materialistic content anymore.
“No one is clicking” looking him up and seeing every video practically has over 1 million views 🤯 He just knows money is made better in other places.
I watch YouTube for fun!!! Haha
Ew
Damn Jeffree. Stuck with you through everything and still watch, but guess the million that still watch you is not enough. If you want to leave YT fine, but the way you said it, what a slap in the face for us million still watching.
Jeffree makes me want to live in Wyoming.
Yeah your right but I’m back after two years
I am not afraid to say it, I LOVE SHANE!!! Stop worrying about things he's done or said YEARS ago!!! He's got a fiancé, he's older, he's been through tough times that made him learn and wise up!! He's just so mf great with who he is!!! I believe Shane is one of the best people on Earth BECAUSE how much he's changed and how much he's grown! He's found his peace and his love for the world, himself, his friends, his job, and he's so much happier, and it DEFINITELY shows!!
Quality of viewers it's better than quantity
It really hurts my soul to see that people are quiting YouTube. I look forward to seeing my favorite creators share their lives with us. Even though Tiktok is instant gratification, it doesn't compare to the joy and anticipation that these documentaries and collabs bring me.
Honey we live for YouTube the hell
Hey I been watching both of you from my space days so I'm still here and sad to hear Jeffrey is stopping YouTube but I get it. Times change just wish it wasn't like this. I love your series together you guys are great ! Much love ❤️
omg! I.m literally cryyyinngg!!! OKAY, jefreee u do u! But, i`ll miss you! Lots of love! Always a fan <3
Except that he's right - at least for his generation. This video is #5 in trending right now & it's only had 1.5 million views?!! For Shane fucking Dawson & J Star? It is time for them to reinvent - that what being a creator is all about and if anyone can do it he can!
love y’all
i use youtube the most
wow jeffrey is so high
wow jeffrey is so hi
Screw tik tok YouTube is more up and personal will always love it. Something about mouthing songs and movie quotes isn't for me. Stupid as hell! Be more interesting Jeffree. It's that simple🤣
Anyone else waiting for the, surprise! we are making the palette? lol
Jeffree saying that at the end really broke my heart. Because i got into makeup and beauty because I found YouTube. It’s was during one of my darkest points in my life. And it saved me. I hate that it’s dead 😢😢😢
While SO many were saying “not another jeffree documentary” they soon realized this is what they needed. You can seriously tell how much better he feels, you can see how much happier he is. I love this so much. 🖤
I love how Jeffrey knows all these facts about Wyoming back to back 🤣💓
Hearing Jeffree say he is gonna quit youtube that no one watches, no one cares, no one goes on it for fun anymore... I was shocked, a little saddened...but I felt that. I have been on youtube for well over a decade and I remember how it used to be vs what it has turned into. There is so much ''business'' wrapped up in it now only certain types of videos make the cut, make it into your recommends, whether you watch them or not. It's not about creativity anymore it's about an algorithm and certain bias. It is sort of fading into the background of other media sites. But many youtubers I grew up with still post, so I still come back, I have found some newer channels that have great promise, but they don't beat what I know and love. So many youtuber's I grew up watching at 15, 16, 17 started quitting within the last 5 years or so. There is only a handful left and I still watch them loyally. I am sad to hear him say he is leaving but he literally has done everything he set out to do on this platform, if it is not engaging him anymore, making him happy in anyway and feels like a waste of time. Fair enough.
Goals!!! I cant wait to be in my "so...." era ☺
would love for wyoming paranormal stuff!!
Jaw DROPPED!
❤❤❤
Wow… Shane really is living he’s “new me” life!  We didn’t see him take his medication for the flight! Lol ❤️
YouTube is not dead, your channel is Jeffree. There's a difference
It’s so nice to see you guys together again. Love the friendship ❤
Please just retire
hearing Jeffree say he's done made me cry like I am so sad but relieved that jefree has had his time and he feels completed
Lots of people still watch YouTube so idk what jeffree ia talking about, I think people just dont really care for Makeup videos as much anymore.
YouTube isn’t dead though but he doesn’t need it anymore
Need more!!!!!!!
i never comment on stuff, but seeing you guys so happy and being your TRUE selves makes me smile, jefree i am loving your growth and energy!! ryland you are glowing and shane i resonate with you so much, you are perfect in every way. this is the most authentic iv ever seen you guys! ugh i cant love this video enough 💜💜
the guy screaming no one cares
I live in Casper Wyoming. I heard you guys ate at Johnny J’s like 10 minutes after I left. Crazy. Jeffery blocked me on insta it’s sad lol
54:26 YouTube Sucks. Yes
I absolutely LOVE youtube, it is still my main source of entertainment, and I've been watching the same creators for nearly 8 years, including Jeffree. but I totally see how hard it must be watching other platforms take over. i think whatever brings Jeffree the most joy should take precedent, and if that is not youtube anymore, than that's that <3
Please film together forever
Idk I think Jeffrey is going to do only fans hahaha
I hardly go on YouTube anymore I only came on to watch this video
jeffree new accent🤣🤣
i’m sorry but Jeffree being all loving to his yacks only to kill them for meat is disgusting
madison looks so happy omg
JEFFREE OMG IM IN TEARS I COME HOME FROM WORKING A STRESSFUL HEALTHCARE JOB AND YOUTUBE IS EVERYTHING TO ME I DONT WATCH NETFLIX OR ANYTHING I WATCH YOUTUBE WE ARE STILL OUT HERE!!🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
yesssssss
Water signs in zodiac  are pretty intuitive.
I love Shane and jeffree together they can actually be themselves around each other  ❤️
YouTube is def not dead... Yet. I think Jeffree's just losing interest in YouTube, which is also ok. They've been doing this for yeaaaaaaaars, so I think it's just a matter of when.
You do not need to make a 55 minute video being super overly dramatic just to say that Jeffree star might be retiring. I just think it’s crazy because I feel like you act extremely over dramatic for no reason and then when the tea actually comes, it’s really not that big of a deal. We are not dumb and we know that you’re just doing another cash bad and you really don’t care about Micha you’re probably just running out of money so you want to make another video and just like Jeffrey sorry because he’s losing a lot of viewers and losing money you guys just want to find anything to bring publicity
YouTube is the only social media I have and I still watch it everyday.  Sad you are leaving but wish you the best. You supplied me with years or entertainment
I love Jeffree🥰🥰🖤
Why not release the palette I would love to have that
Awe Jeffree.....don't quit youtube. I've been waiting for u to come back. You have to post for us to watch. I'm so sad. I care. 😭
I disagree with Jeffery saying YouTube is dead, I still watch daily and I know loads of others that do too. It makes me sad to think of everyone leaving!   I just think the beauty/makeup industry and drama stuff has fizzled right out since lockdown…
these videos make me so happy and i’m rlly proud of jeffrey and hope he is happy with his decision and found piece within himself without all the toxicity tbh. love u all so much💗💗 can’t wait for part 3 omg…
are you gay?
The song around ten minutes... I thought it was Shane singing 😆
"Time flies when yer farminnnn!" 💀🤣
I still watch Youtube all the time. There is just more options besides makeup content. Jeffrey had his moment so I understand why he is over making YouTube videos.
I dont agree with Jeffrey on the statement that "youtube is dead", sure maybe on the beauty side I don't know i was never a part of that community, but i still watch gaming videos 24/7, and when someone uploads a vlog, tea, storytime, conspiracy or any vid I always watch if its createdby a creator I like, I rarely watch tv, but im always on youtube.
DO PARANORMAAAL CONTENT!! I missed you guys so much tffff
The only reason I am watching this is because you both are in it. I am so mad at cancel culture and what it did to youtube.
It’s only because nobody watches him anymore!
PLEASE DO A PARANORMAL SERIES WITH JEFFREE IN WYOMING, PRETTY PRETTY PLEASE LIKE IM BEGGING YOU SHANEEEEEE.. I NEED THIS IN MY LIFEEEE
Although YouTube isn’t as crazy as it was even a couple years ago there’s still some of us that watch it. I hope that makes it worthwhile, knowing you guys still have fans and people that support you despite toxic cancel culture.  Watching this video was like catching up with “old friends”. Seeing how everyone’s lives have changed since Covid and seeing how successful you guys still are.
I love jeffree but YouTube isn't dead... Sadly his content is what died... I still watch his make up release videos but other than that I don't have much interest. I watch YouTube daily... it's just that I would likely click another video over his these days but there's still millions who love him
I feel like this is a healing video for both of them. And for us who were there when their friendship first started . 😅
Can't wait to see more
Shane… yer not an actor
Ahhhh I can't wait for more
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Chris is sweet and I really like him but he is a horrendous camera man..so many shots over exposed and shaky pointing the camera at the floor. Literally like every fight video ever filmed 😅
hearing jeffree mention jenna 🥺 i wish she would make a comeback but i do see where him and jenna were coming from. as people who have been on this platform for so long, they got to see it all. they’ve done everything and have built up their platforms to the point where it’s okay to leave them and start anew somewhere else. it’s sad to see but i do find myself watching less and less youtube because all my favorite creators are slowing down their posting schedules
Appreciate things while you still have them. 🥂
Why’s jeffree fine
The volcano at the bar was me
Ugh I just don't know how I feel about this yet
Lies Jeffree I love YouTube and watch it allll 😅
So Jeffrey fully established a whole second business within 2 years? That's amazing
Jeffree spoke facts— I used to only watch YouTube because of you guys honestly — and now I stream everything and said bye to YouTube. But I’m here for this. YouTube SUCKS.
sad
❤❤❤
when he brought out his gunnnnn🤣🤣love  Him!
I absolutely love this series. Thank you for always keeping it quirky and real 💯
This is crazy how much time has past. Last time you did the series with Jeffrey I had a 5 month old and was so excited for the conspiracy pallet. Now I'm holding my 2 month old and watching my 3 year old dance to the music in this video. We love you Shane and hope nothing but the best for you.
JEFFREE CANT QUIT NOOOOOO 😭😭
Well you and Ryland are literally the only youtube videos I watch!
God in Christianity, Jesus in Christianity, and Holy Spirit in Christianity help me be an ultimate genius.
I care I watch your videos 😢 what about the ones who have been there since the beginning you’ve help me so much Jeff
First- I love seeing your face again! Second- I love getting to see Jeffrey coming into themselves (sorry I don’t know their pronouns so I’m going with a safe option lol) and finding their true self!  I can’t wait to see what’s next! (I bet you enjoy the yak burger and didn’t expect to!)
Just know, I’m here. I care. I watch every single video. Love y’all so much
The fricking silencer on the gun 😂😂 bro are silencers on concealed carry firearms legal?
I mean I still watch YouTube every night to go to sleep to 🤷‍♀️
I'm do sad.. YouTube has been affected but I still want everyone to post videos. I still watch youtube!
Watching you guys literally fills me with joy. I don’t get why you guys were cancelled. Cause you are guys are so genuine and just great to watch!
When you don’t care anymore you become A BOSS!
When is part 2?
I am still watching!  Just saying.  But do understand where Jeffrey is coming from.  I did some videos and then my body and mentally illness took me down.  I want to do videos but why?  Thought about doing Snapchat...but why?  Watching still gives me joy. Making videos.... maybe if I was still young.  I really don't care if someone finds me beautiful or interesting.  We have all grown up and do different things.  But I miss everyone.  Still stay in contact with a few people.  The world keeps turning. 🥺
Trending #4 as I’m watching 🥲 I love Shane & jeffree .. super sad to see him just on TikTok it’s so toxic
I think it's so hard for YouTube because a lot of the era that watched a lot of YouTube have such busy lives now, all of us having kids, or working full time, dealing with a lot of health issues, having to look after others, people can be easily swept up in the circle of life and it's a shame that we've all forgotten to take time to watch people. I wish it would be different but, after everything we've all been through I think the mutual feeling was oh there's not enough time to get where we want to be. We love you Jeffree and Shane for this, it's something we all have needed!
Am I the only one concerned for Jefferee’s safety now? Like they were being so candid about the exact location of the ranch
Why morphe did that?
WE'RE STILL HERE
More conspiracy theories!! Pls 🙏 maybe more about the illuminati or something like that
the  elton john part killed me
Y’all really some country girls😂😂
😂😂😂 I died like ofc that’s Jeffrey , I love them sommfmfmdm
You know what?I love Jeffree's new life!!And let me just say how i love the look without wig and makeup!! Gorgeous!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m very proud of jeffree. I’ve watched him since I was 11-12 when he sung with BOTDF and warped tour events. I never put down the computer cause there was always a new video of jeffree. So sad to see him go but change is how jeffree is .. jeffree. He’s always onto the next thing, always on top, ten thousand steps ahead of the game. Way to go jeffree
Jeffree saying how no one watches YouTube is hilarious🤣 projecting much?  No sis, no one watches you or shane anymore 😬 YouTube is astoundingly popular with amazing creators, the people have voted and your 15 mins are done! Sad but true hun💅🏼
These clowns are the reason Western Civilization is failing so miserably.
I love you guys together!!  So happy your back!!!
People would watch if he posted. He posts like 1 video every few months. I get it he has been busy… but girl. I am here for just some real life vlogs Jeffree!! I love YouTube. I don’t even watch tik tok.
In literally crying from fear that this platform is literally over I HATE TT!!!! IT CAUSES ADHD IN EVERYONE!!!
I still watch youtube
And no taxes!😃in Wyoming
I feel like people still watch YouTube people just don’t watch makeup content anymore
I'm SHOCK
Jeffree we are here for your new life in Urube hopefully you reconsider.I like this new direction you are going
Same YouTube means a lot to me also. You will have my clicks until I can't physically click no more. ❤️ U Shane Tell Jeffrey to stop manifesting that for himself everyone has their ups and downs there is beauty to be found in both.
I LIVE FOR YT !!! ITS ALL I REALLY HAVE IN MY LIFE PLS DON'T LEAVE
I can't put into word how happy I am that you're back. Soooo. welcome back! Love U!!!
are we all in agreement that he’s deleting hate comments?
I remember seeing Jeffery live when he toured with brokencyde, crazy to see where he is now
I was really sad when Jeffrey Star said he was leaving YT. He is such an inspiration on many levels. He has grown so much. Love your series Shane I only pray for the best for you and your family.
First Jenna now jeffree 😢
That  36:40 Jeffree.  I want to know him.
I love YouTube still though 🥺❤️
Why do we have to watch 20 min of you being annoying before anything actually happens in your videos…..
“No one watches youtube anymore”  *gets 1.5 million views in one day*
Wow that really hit when Jeffrey said YouTube is basically dying I’ve grown up watching the both of you and I still watch your old videos all the time 🥰xx
L + RATIO
these series make me the happiest :')
This sucks because I always looked forward for the day Jeffree would do a foundation line and do a big reveal on youtube. Now I know I'll never see that 😭 I use youtube everyday so it's crazy he's leaving.
they are so funny together! but lmaoo, have jeffree finally truly lost his mind bahaha
my happiest moments is seeing shane smile like ongggg
I’ve been wanting to move out of WA state. Wyoming, Colorado, and Montana are my top picks for my family.
I've been here for the entire time. Like, i've seen every shane dawson video, Jeffrey grew on me when he did the collabs with Shane. And it was awesome... I really felt horrible when Shane left the internet and all. I really really love your content. And I already  love this series !! Luff u guys
Why did they take a plane, it would have been a 4 hour drive lol
God id love to learn how he did it. Star literally went from the bottom to the top like how?
No Jeffree, YouTube is still very much alive and well. Maybe your little bubble of peers and colleagues on YouTube are no longer popping like they used to be but YouTube is still very much a massive platform with hundreds of millions of viewers lol. And to complain about getting 1 million views on videos as if that's not enough is so clueless and messed up. He just can't accept that people don't want to watch HIM anymore because people know he's kind of a shit human being.
A relaxed Jeffree is gorgeous 49:20 wow beautiful face, body language and aura - just peaceful ❤
I forgot how effortlessly hilarious Jeffree is 💀💀💀
I still watch youtube regularly, NGL it gets me through my work days on most days lol. I prefer it to tiktok and the endless scrolling.
Ah Jeffree’s news made me tear up… I care😔😭 you all have no idea how many times you all have saved my depression… i love you guys😔😭
I love Ryland just absolutely roasting Shane the whole time ❤
STOP I NEED JEFREE
I love the energy Jeffree is emitting now. 🥺 Also I lived in Wyo for one year as an exchange student and I defo can attest to the ghost activities !
so you’re telling me shane dawson and jeffree star were hanging out in my town and i had no idea? 😧
Why are you giving away all your privacy to TikTok? When you just click on the Terms page, you are giving them access to EVERYTHING including all the apps you have, all your personal info across  ALL your devices, ALL of your financial info. When you just blindly click OK, you are giving ALL your info to a Chinese company.  Look it up!! YouTube is safer to use. If Jeffree goes to tiktok, I won’t go there. I am NOT giving away all my info for him.
'no ones clicking' - 19.5M views in a day on a 55 minute video .. 🙄
I get what Jeffree means, I mean nowadays it’s all about popularity and who has the most views or the most shocking/exciting content because there’s so much going on and the newer generation of viewers literally make and break creators. We (as in people who only dove into watching youtube 6/7 years ago) don’t know what that’s like because we used to watch real people doing real shit, it’s almost like those people were our friends. But now? There’s a fucking popular creator every 3 days and it’s like “ugh okay… what are you gonna do that I haven’t watched yet?” It’s almost saturated.
I would watch a reality show of Jeffree so quick.
I pray you never leave YT too, Shane and Ryland! That will be one heartbreaking day and I'm sure for more than just me
I can totally relate to Jeffree not wanting to show off his house on social media, that's why I feel like I will never have a media presence 🤫 I am just too secretive and private!! I want to be an influencer or a medialite but I just can't get past that privacy barrier. So...Stay true to what makes you HAPPY! 👏 So happy to see this series and the jeffree/shane combo again 💜
Don’t stop making videos Shane
not the dexter theme song 😂
I'm so sad Jeffree is leaving YT 😔 He's such a nostalgia and comfort on here. I hope he changes his mind!
thats sad because I look forward to videos from you 3 :(
Wtf I didn’t know jeffree came out with a pet line!!! Fuck yes I have a Pomeranian as well 😊
Happy Birthday Jeffree Star ❤
I only use YouTube now for shane, jeffree, Colleen, & jimmy & when I’ve watched all them I go to my secondary people. Sad I’m losing one if my favs🥲
i love shane and jeffery togheter:9
I LOVE YOUTUBE!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
jeffree literally looks so well and healthy, so happy for him!!! 😊😊
j and s ghost hunting lol
The camera keeps going zoom in zoom out, it is impossible to watch.....
I care... I'm here... I still want the old YouTube 😪 😩 😫
Anyone else think Jeffree kind of looks like Lucas now? The thin short hair, the lips.
Okay if youtubes dead then Shane can you get a series on netflix plz like interviews with hot celebs (tana and eugingie) vibes. Or conspiracy videos and all your jeffree videos. Because I can't deal with losing yall on YouTube
I watch YouTube every day! There’s still people here! I don’t want tik tok, so please don’t stop these series
I spend at least 1 to 2 hours on YouTube every day keeping up with my favorite people and I have notifications on for so many channels I love. It’s not dead what so ever.. I just did not love Jeffree’s attitude. He can step away from YouTube without that negativity. I think he’s projecting. It’s not that no one cares, it’s that he doesn’t care anymore which is fine. He looks like he’s doing well and I’m excited about this series
I want to encourage believers and non-believers of the faith of Jesus Christ.   First addressing the non-believers, please do the following:   1. Acknowledge you're a sinner in need of a savior 2. Repent / Confess your sins to the Lord 3. Accept Jesus as your Lord & Savior 4. Flee from your repented sins   Whether your sins are as little as lying or as big as murder, God will accept you no matter what you have done. The gospel is for all people. When you repent be honest with the Lord and confess everything to him and then walk in the way of the Lord (holiness).   Here are some scriptures to encourage you in this new journey of your life, but only if you choose to believe:   If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. - I John 1:9   For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. - John 3:16   Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. - Proverbs 3:5‭-‬6   Therefore “Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you.” “I will be a Father to you, And you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the Lord Almighty.” - II Corinthians 6:17‭-‬18   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, But fools despise wisdom and instruction. - Proverbs 1:7    Finally, for the believers or those who have just converted from above. I encourage you to meditate on the word of God more often so that we can be more fruitful in life. I want to share with you how I do so. I record my voice on my phone with a voice recorder while reading a scripture or scriptures and I constantly play it back. So, that his word may be planted in my heart. If you're a believer who has a hard time remembering scripture or wants to better their relationship with God then I would say give it a shot. This will help you overcome sins in your life and overall be a better disciplined follower of Christ.   Encouragement on meditation: I will meditate on Your precepts, And contemplate Your ways. - Psalms 119:15   But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night. - Psalms 1:2   “If you love Me, keep My commandments. - John 14:15   For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness. Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit. - I Thessalonians 4:7‭-‬8
Jeffery is gorg without makeup
I still love YouTube!!!!
fucking love the new Jeffery love a Queen who uses there 2nd admendment right!  all queens should be able to protect yourself!
Okay but the way I clicked so fast after seeing that you guys posted should be also be taken into consideration. I still watch YouTube. I absolutely do not care for TikTok. You two together are incredible.
It is really neat to see you guys come back together after taking some years to heal and grow. This is so nostalgic for me and I am so grateful you guys are doing this. You are an inspiration for anyone going through a hard time, it gets better ❤️ and then it will get bad again, but the light will always come. Congrats guys ❤️
I don’t understand why they got cancelled ? From videos they made years ago? Was that what it was . I thought we were over that
The gun scene should've been edited out. I know someone that was showing off their gun and someone was shot and killed by mistake.  They aren't Toys. WTF.
Wait did Morphe really drop Jeffree ?!
Devastated.... Absolute devastation.
I obviously lived under a rock during covid. But what happen to Shane's old videographer (is that how it's spelled, not English sorry!) From when he did the make up Series? The redhead? No hate to the new person but I'm just curious 😂
Jeffree is literally everything. Love him pulling out the gun 🤣
Jeffree with a "pew pew" is the content I've been waiting for!!! YAAASSSS BITCH lol
How the fuck am I gonna know if a product is good or not now???😭😭😭😭
Please don’t be encouraged to stop making YouTube videos. I’ve been watching you non stop for over 11 years. I’m excited to watch whatever you make. I would be heart broken.
What, YouTube is 100% the best social platform
Jeffree looks amazing and happy!! I left this episode a little sad tho. A lot of my favorite people have stopped really posting on youtube and I don’t want to lose any more. I much prefer long form content over short. 😢
Shane I have a serious question.  You have some great land, a pond and a ranch that you could use to make a really awesome horror movie.  Why aren't you? Ugh this is so boring and we all know that you want to do horror. Also should I just unsubscribe now or are you going to address Des?
You can definately tell that Jeffree has done a lot of healing. And I am so happy about that. Having been around watching since the first series and to see where he was then to see where he is now, and knowing everything that he's been through since, its a beautiful thing to see him genuinely happy.
Can't wait for YouTube to die and get replaced by another platform, it literally can't be worse than Google's reign of raining bullshit.
💀
I’m in love with this new series!!!!
I get what Jeffrey is saying about no one really watching YouTube anymore, but his makeup videos were honestly one of the things I really still looked forward to on YouTube.
Whoever is filtering the comments is soon a great job!
Only Shane knows how to put an Add that I won't skip lmao fast and cool
I don’t watch YouTube anymore but I will always watch your series
I really like this version of Jeffery. This seems like the *real* him. I'm happy he found inner peace.
No one on YouTube? So disconnected! He had 1.3 M views on his previous video and we are all struggling to get 1000. It sux? Really he still making bank off YouTube, albeit not as much as before but still more than most. Greedy much? Jeffrey doesn’t change — always biting the hand that feeds!
I just love you guys. You are inspiring!
Awe I love when my two least favorite pieces of shit land in the same toilet <3
I'm dying at Jeffree just whipping out a suppressed pistol 🤣
I love seeing new Shane and Jeffree content!❣️ also.. Avengers ended amazingly, but also sadly too😭
“ She’s hangin it up you hear “ 🥺 broke me. We need a proper farewell jeffree video or I don’t think I’ll be able to cope.
Someone  smack Jeffery  youtube is always popular  and all u guys are awsome pls dont stop
Gotta do what Matt Walsh said they can only cancel you if you let them
i was born i casper
I absolutely love this, I just came back so Hiii bitches! I’ve not watched YouTube in 2,3 years🤣
i watch youtube more than anything i’m still here 😢
"No one is clicking anymore" as this video as 1.4 Million Views.  And not to mention the amount of views Jefree's videos get, thousands to a few million views like, how many views are you expecting if that's not enough for you?? It could be more but thats still a lot of fucking people.. Like I watch actual TV like once every few months. Majority of the content me and my friends consume are on YouTube and tiktok, and I can't really watch tiktok when I'm eating or doing something else, I watch videos that are 30+ minutes multiple times a day if I can find something interesting, I totally understand why he wants to leave YouTube, but why need to bash on YouTube as a whole just cuz your channel isn't going good or you'rejust not interested anymore? I've grown up with YouTube, its not going anywhere, for me at least.
Please don't stop the videos!!! I just LOVEEEE YouTube and you guys are my fav
Speak for yourself Jeffree 🙄 people just stopped watching YOU because all you did was gloat and throw your money in people's faces! You got carried away and lost a lot of die hard fans! That's so fucked up you would say shit like that in front of them as they literally are making content FOR YouTube. And that makes my point you became so rude. PLEASE DON'T EVER LEAVE YOUTUBE SHANE AND RYLAND! YOU GUYS HELP SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING! ❤️
I'll deff miss Jeffree videos!!! Please don't follow in his steps..im still clicking lol
I love the self-growth here: Jeffree transitioning from being broke to being obsessed with materialism, to being “disgusted” with it and shedding all of his stuff and being happier now than ever. Love it!
Very sad to hear he will be leaving YouTube I love and still watch. But do what makes you happy in this life. ❤ Shane I hope you dont leave too.
You guys are always great together... Bye the way I still watch you tube lol
This is not it.
I'm still here. I still come here for enjoyment screw all of those other apps. We barely use them
I love this friendship!!! And the editing is on point!!!!! ❤
I watch Youtube almost everyday. I love watching you and this series. All of you guys are awesome.
I still watch YouTube every single day I found a bunch of new content creators that I really love I watch a lot of Mukbang and eating shows which is weird bc I’m vegan but this is my entertainment &mmy escape
Jeffree looks so much better without all the hair and makeup. Even the nails, I can't help but think, just take them off... lol, he works on a farm, it just doesn't seem genuine or authentic in the way it used to be. It's clear he prefers more tamed casual sort of look  His house I think reflects his true personality more. It's more masculine
I watch YouTube all day every day I haven’t had a TV since 2017 and I have no regrets about that I loved your first series I’m so sorry you guys had to go through what you went through but Jeffree star you will be missed I never had anything but love for you and I never even looked into any of the drama ever
I am so proud of both Jeffree and Shane. They have come so far after all the craziness of the past few years. They both seem so much happier.
OOMG I'm so sad.. I always loveee watching Jeffree, he's still one of my faves to watch :( Tbh I think it's so sweet how Jeffree makes Chris feel comfortable in the conversation. Such a nice video. Can't wait for the next one ❤✨
Nooo Jeffree star can’t quit YouTube
Damn….. Jeffree saying YouTube is dead 💀 hurts my soul, I watch YouTube daily! I’ve watched YouTube since I was 11 years old. I’m 23 now. I pay for YouTube red, like this site is my main source of entertainment. I would cry if the rest of the creators left, like so many already have. I kinda hate Tik tok, it’s not for me.
Watching you guys back together filming is soooo good. Jeffrey the Godfather 🤔maybe, he has a huge heart and a businessman with talent…perfect , congratulations a YouTube icon , that has done everything. This friendship will last a lifetime imagine baby shalan 🤗 living with alpacas and going on holidays to see Jeffies yak ….just a normal day 🥰 This was like no time had past and very emotional, love you all x
Jeffery knows business hunnyyy
Just sitting here, crying.  Feeling so happy for Jeffrey and Shane to be in a better place. I don’t have TikTok, I am going to say bye to you Jeffrey. Very very happy for you <3
I love him followed him since MySpace days ur so inspirational Jeffree 😢❤
noooooooooooooooooooooo nooooooooooooooooooo dont stop love from uk x
loving this ♥️
Jeffrey didn’t send his jet to pick you up? Lol
Long form content > short form content
Ugh. I’ve been here since 2007. YouTube is still my GO TO. I spend hours a day on here listening to podcasts while I work and watching videos after my little one is in bed.
I reeeeallly wanna see you guys go ghost hunting 😂😂😂
I never knew Wyoming could be so appealing haha
#4 on trending 🎉
I really hope Shane doesn’t quit YouTube as well. YouTube is what I watch on my downtime. I look forward to Shane’s videos. However, I’m so glad Jeffree is doing so well and humbled it seems. He’s changed so much since he’s moved && I’m here for it. I love this series so much.
I   watch YouTube at least 3x a day. Especially while im getting ready for the day!
Jeffree: Nobody is watch YouTube  Also Jeffree: recieves 700k views on his most recent video.  Maybe your not getting the views you once did but that's still A LOT of people watching you.
best content fr
I wonder if he will build a pool in that backyard? Or a hot tub?
I don't think YouTube is dead. But I think the YouTube Beauty Community is definitely dead. I discovered yt for beauty content and you couldn't pay me to watch a yt pallet reveal or tutorial now (15 years later)
Spider Fact: Although most people are under the impression that all spiders are venomous... Uloboridae are a family of spiders which have no venom glands at all. These spiders religh upon wrapping their prey quickly in silk. Once the prey is subdued, Uloboridae regurgitate digestive enzymes which then dissolve the victim into liquid food.
This series got a lot more interesting after this part. People don't come to youtube anymore because of the oversaturation of ads everywhere and the convenience of tiktok. Who wants to watch four ads on an eight minute video when you can watch a three minute video with no ads?
I love watching YouTube still.  I like the longer videos than tiktoks and Instagram reels. Don't quit jeffree 😭  I am always in need of new makeup reviews, brand launches and all things beauty.
Always breaks my heart seeing Casper. That’s where my ex is from and I miss her daily. Even tho she was crazy.
To save everyone some time, Shane and Ryland and Chris travel to Wyoming to see Jeffrey Star. Shane thinks he's funny. Jeffrey picks them up at the airport in his new green car. Jeffrey has a gun in his car. Haha Jeffrey says he's a changed person, he is less “materialistic”😉 thank God I'm watching this on 2x speed. They tour Jeffery's new ranch while talking about how great their lives were before they got canceled.... nothing happened. Don’t waste your time.
600 acres is almost as much as Central Park
I just love Jeffrey 💗 he’s just so real!
As someone who comes to youtube as an escape from all of the typical social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram or what may have you. I enjoy watching your YouTube videos as well as Jeffree Star's videos like OMGGGG!!! I enjoy seeing the content that y'all have posted and it makes me so incredibly happy to see this relationship after so many years. It is more of an escape for me to see people whose lives vary a lot from mine and it gives me a reason to be involved with my favorite creators additionally some of my favorite people on this planet. Everything that you do or Jefree does makes me happy to see y'all happy and finding some peace after this stupid cancellation spell, I mean what a joke!  I hate that people can't exist without someone being offended like be in your own lane and worry about your life and world; be kind and leave peoples lives alone. Everyone makes their own choices and it's not in your control or power. Anyways that's enough about my own rant, but I love you guys and God bless your lives and whatever it brings🤍
I missed the gang 🥰🫶🫶
I will always love YouTube and long form content
The day that Shane quits YouTube will be a very sad day for his fans and the YouTube community 😅 he’s the last person from my childhood YouTube era that is still making *amazing!* content. Love you Shane
WHY IS JEFFREE LIKE A FULL COMPLETE PERSON NOW. so much more calm (obviously still himself and sparkling from the inside out.) But seems truly content and at peace. Woah. This was sooo fun to see.
well shoot i still click..
I love YouTube!! I watch it so much!
Is it me or does Jeffree sound more southern because it suits him so much 😂❤️🥰
No plot, no commentary, no camera work, but This is a documentary this is just a boring vlog
…… this has gone to far 🤦🏽‍♀️
"you son of a bitch"😂
I will always love the Jeffrey Shane Ryland combo. Hilarious; I’m so proud of where you all are ❤️
So sad Jeffrey is quitting youtube. I still love YouTube I still love Shane's videos and ryland's videos that you guys put out. Thank you so much for the series Shane. I'm living for it.
Im actually shocked about the “no one watches YouTube” comment. I am someone that only watches YouTube. I’m in my 30s and I have never made a TikTok account and never will. It’s still my ritual to watch YouTube every morning after my kids get on the bus.  I have a 15 year old, 13 year old, and a 9 year old and all 3 of them almost always have YouTube playing on their TVs (whether they’re actually paying attention to it or not).  My parents watch YouTube and are always sending me videos.   Maybe it’s just us?
I have been watching you both since before conspiracy happened and I don't even know what happened that led to both of you being cancelled. I never realised what exactly happened.. I don't see a problem with anything. I wonder what went wrong and how did it affect so badly? I don't even feel the urge to Google about it because honestly, I don't care and I just don't believe that you were cancelled for something. Like ryland said.. when you block it all, you just don't know what's happening.
Jeffree is actually a really good person. The way he included Chris and also worked on his self awareness. That is maturity. I love it for him that he is happier cutting down on the material things in his life - I always thought it would be so overwhelming owning so much stuff
I only check YouTube for Shane. Jeffery isn’t wrong. I’d rather scroll on TikTok.
I thought all these ppl were cancelled, what happened??
You both have made this series so personal, vulnerable and a real kick to reality. I have been a personal fan of both you and Jeffree (Music Era) since I was 13 were my parents worried HAHA probably 😅 you have made this journey as if I've been friends with you guys and you just forgot to invite me 💁🏼‍♀️ I can't wait to see what's ahead
I live in Finland, the gun part was so weird for me 😅
I was dying to see Jeffree on YouTube like before.. 😭 Thank you Shane for bringing in so many hours of you and Jeffree together.. 🥺❤️🍀
He’s right the only time I come on here is for their combined content  🫠😅
It's funny how I can relate more with Jeffrey now 😂 living in the middle of nowhere, surrounded with cattle (instead of yacks), living in a decent sized house. And then I moved to Houston 🤣🤣 it was so overwhelming that we had to move to a smaller town in Texas.
I don’t think YouTube is dead but I think the beauty side has dramatically fizzled out, which is still primarily what Jeffree posts. You can tell it’s not his main passion anymore. If he switched his content to show his new life in Wyoming and this real side to him I think a lot more people would watch and his passion for YouTube could come back.
In all honesty I would LOVE to watch Jeffree do yak videos like yes queen teach me things I don’t know I love animals
its really coming to the end of the youtube era and im so upset i have watched yalls videos since i was 10 and im an adult now it makes me really sad that its coming to an end
I screamed seeing the Casper airport 🤣 like this is my home I knew exactly where everything was💓 probably one of the most decent places to be in the state of Wyoming… proud to be born and raised here and happy I never left. Can’t wait to see more of my town as the series continues. Welcome to Wyoming💛🤎
Dont you dare quit Youtube shane please!!
i lived in wyoming all summer i totally forgot Jeffery was one of the few ppl there with me loo
I love this Jeffree!!!
That ending hurt. I think the truest of fans stick around. I have watched Shane for half of my life. I see through the cancellations. People come and go, people move on, but the ones who truly love you stay.
EXCUSE ME I STILL WATCH YOUTUBE.  Fuck Tick  tok shhhiiiittt
Hearing that no one cares about youtube anymore, as tiny YouTubers just starting out, is so scary and disheartening. We love content creating but if the biggest are all leaving the platform, what does that tell us newbies?💔
I hate that Jeffree thinks YouTube is dead, TikTok is lame and cringy to me, I would see adds for it on youtube years before it blew up, so if he made videos like he used too, I guarantee he could bring it back to life
this is not a documentary, it's just a really dragged-out vlog.
exyaktly... I'm done ahahahahah
Ummm YouTube has been a part of over half my life! I'm not going anywhere!! I will continue to watch YouTube videos every single day!
As a fan, I've already lost Jenna. I'm afraid the rest will also slowly disappear and that only makes me depressed. I skipped this video which is really sad, I'll admit. but a haunted series exploring the paranormal hotspots in Wyoming with Jeffree would be great
YouTube is not dead, Yet!  Your videos get well over 1 million viiiews!!!
I’m so proud of Jeffree! He’s doing sooo good and he looks so healthy! You both have increased your happiness and healthy by leaving LA. LA sucked the life out of y’all!
I still watch YouTube😔
Jeffree I do care, dont give it up😢
i'm glad you too came back together
Honestly i love how transparent Jeffree and he doesn’t care to let you know how much he’s sold, how much things are worth, let’s you know exactly what you kind of want to know as a viewer. Idk if that makes sense but he’s just very straight forward and interesting to me
YouTube wouldn’t be “dying” if creators could stop being so problematic, upload consistently, and if creators stopped just ditching YouTube when their views start dipping.  That’s what’s creating the dying YouTube  Has NOTHING to do with us viewers on this app because I’m sure more than half of us use YouTube daily and we DO like long content. I just don’t have anyone left to watch on here that’s consistent with uploads and isn’t in a bunch of drama all the time.  We as viewers just want good, fun, drama free videos with consistency. That’s all we ask.   Also is creators stopped following the fastest cash grab and follow whatever platform is trending ie: creators leaving YouTube for TikTok or becoming less active on YouTube and more on tiktok then wonder why their YouTube views are dropping?
I understand where Jeffree is coming from when he says he's done with YouTube. Jeffree Star has the financial means and entrepreneur mindset to do so. Shane and others have founded their career off of YouTube so it wouldn't make sense for them to leave. If you read this Shane, please don't leave YouTube. I literally look forward to your videos. It's my only escape from feeling like I'm just a mom and wife. I love when I get to stay up late watching your videos.
It breaks my heart to hear, “nobody cares! Nobody clicks on here anymore, we’re wasting our time!” The world is recovering and healing. From trauma, a pandemic, from isolation, from depression and anxiety, emotional suffering. The world feels like an empty void, and people came out of this pandemic mentally torn apart. Myself included. YouTube is the only space that I feel I can go to in order to find some real sense of connection. Of course I care. Of course I want the next thing in this void and empty space. Of course I want change. Watching all of you since I was in high school over a decade ago, to watching every last one walk away? It leaves us feeling empty ourselves. It leaves us wondering if that connection even mattered in the first place. But it’s depression and anxiety, trying to heal from trauma. I hope you know there’s a place of love to be found here. Heartbroken, but we can heal together.
I’ve honestly missed y’all’s dynamic.  The two of you together is just something special and so joyful to watch
Shane, you always know how to keep me on a cliffhanger!!!! so excited to watch this series, love all of y'all so much - muah 💋
There is entirely too much fake laughing in this video!  I can't stand Shane and his clan, I only watched to see Jeffree!  Youtube is far from dead!!!  It will still be around when we are all dead!
Please please please stop posting. Just please go away
I watch YouTube I wish you would upload TikTok’s on here cause I’m not getting TikTok
I think you need to take a different approach Jeffree, I love you and many others do too. You don’t need to do beauty reviews anymore. Just be real and talk about life & show farm footage. Or whatever makes you feel inspired
I LOVED this! Every moment, all the laughs. ^_^
Awww :( this ended on such a sad note. I’m still watching though. Many of us are still watching. Jeffree looked so sad, I can’t even 😭😭😭
SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT EPISODE!!!!! I'm honestly so happy to see Shane and Jeffree hanging out again! I love their vibes together! I'd also LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE PARANORMAL STUFF! Maybe have a little ghost hunting moment on the Ranch!? 🤟👻⭐
I NEEED MORE! Never stawwwwp🎉
That made me sad that jeffrees leaving YouTube since I deleted all of my social medias and now only watching YouTube it’s hard to know one of my go to YouTubers I’d leaving☹️. But Shane and rylan you guys stay on YouTube please🥹🫶🏼❤️, even if it’s reviewing or daily blogs as long as you guys are in it and the funny jokes and laughs are everything, thank you guys for filming for us🫶🏼
Please don’t listen to the no one is watching because we are watch you and Ryland and Morgan we love you guys 😢💔
I don’t think YouTube is dead..I think the oversharing of lavish lifestyles and the nastiness is dead. If you’re creative, people will watch.
Jeffree is the only one who can give true makeup reviews anymore bc he doesn’t need the money, he can be brutally honest. I wish he would do more of them
That statement about youtube is false. Most people over the age of 20 still watch YouTube. Kids are slowly going to tiktok.
Tell everyone you are extremely mentally ill without actually verbalizing it and you end up with these clowns.
I watch YouTube for fun!! And hearing that Jeffree is gonna quit is actually kinda.... shocking and sad.
Imagine jeffree being 45 years old still following trends 🤣🤣 jeffree got hundreds of thousands of views just a few days ago but NO ONE is clicking?  Bs bro
hearing jeffree saying he's quitting youtube makes me so sad
i love this...
I have been waiting for this video for such a long time. I remember when some of the drama went down and I took a break. Yet, something told me to give them another chance. I still use my conspiracy palette among other Jeffrey Star products and still love them to this day. I’m incredibly proud of how each of you have gotten to this point and moved on from the past. Looking forward to more amazing content!
Wow que bonito queda!!
The end of this video made me sad. I don't really have friends in real life so watching my fave creators gives me comfort and happiness. I really hope it's just Jeffree's palette reveal videos that don't get as many views because there are just so many of them lol. But watching Shane and Jeffree together is hilarious and hopefully still pulls high numbers!
Love love these two together!!!!!!! ❤
He said at the airport the yak meats were in 5 restaurants then at the house he said 6 restaurants did anyone else catch that
Jeffree just called me a NOONE... excuse me, I still watch jeffree for his creativity, if he quits its gonna leave me so sad
Shane + Jeffree is my favorite content I’ve seen on YouTube I could watch this shit every day all day forever. Two people I adore and they’re so funny and amazing. Love it 10/10
Why does jeffree have a silencer on his gun 😅
IM LIVING FOR A PART 2 palette 🎨 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Maybe I’m part of the old generation (I’m 25) but I still watch YouTube for comfort! I think I’ll always watch it if it’s there 🥺 just hoping Shane doesn’t leave!!
Lmao why’re y’all still here
Ut feels like watching a tv series with big time jump so every character changed
I still watch YouTube and watched all your videos J and I'm not even into makeup
Jeffery before you leave Youtube PLEASE!!! Can you give us the tea on who does your nails? Like there so crazy but beautiful.
I CARE! youtube will not go anywhere for me.. i will pick my subscriptions over any netflix show..
Nooooo😭😭😭😭😭😭 JEFREEEEEEEEEE PLSSSSS
I’d buy the new pallet. Also it’s great that you both came to the realization that the industry is so toxic & LA is no place for anyone with a gentle heart like you guys. I’m so proud of all of you 🤍
wait....Jeffree's leaving youtube???
Listen I watch YouTube. YouTube has sucked for a long time like since 2015 almost but there isn't anything to replace it. I will never download tiktok
The Jefree Shane friendship is a goal.
Some reaction channels are not happy lmao
Jeffree seems like a genuinely good friend. 💜
Omg i really hope they do some paranormal activity together🥺
I’ll always open this app for a Jeffree, Shane, ryland, Morgan, Lizzie or Chris notification and that’s facts 🤷🏼‍♀️
youtube killed itself with all the demonitization, always striking other creater. Dont get me started on all the ads we have to sit thru. I click off a video after the 3rd ad that comes up.
I think whether or not youtube is dead depends on the content niche you’re in. A lot of communities are still growing and thriving on youtube but I guess for Jeffrey, the beauty community isn’t one of them.
THATS CAP WE ARE STILL HERE FOR YOU SHANE KEEP GOING !!
I still use the palet. In fact I'm wearing it today. I love the conspiracy palet.
“I like traveling! Just not with…Elton John..” 🤣🤣
Nooooo 😢 Jeffrey don’t leave
There is NO way shane isn't cheating with Jeffree.
Chris and Shane should just sleep together and get over it
I love the new Jeffree. As some who been with him since the beginning I love to see him changed and humble and happy. And we are birthday twins and the same age ☺️
THE ENDING OMGGG
Dexter music 😝
yaaassssss trending hshs yeah
I literally want to go back to my home town just to see if I run into Jeffery. Lol ❤ Casper, wyoming 🤘🏽🙌🏽   Yeeee hawww.
i need a haunted wyoming series with jeffree and shane
Lord not Jeffrey with the silencer 😂😂💀. In Texas we are open carry to. Lol
Isn't Shane a p*do????
I started watching YouTube around 2012 and 10 years later at the age of 27 I’m still here ❤️ I hope YT doesn’t die out because that would be a sad day.
I’m happy Shane’s back. I also don’t understand why he was canceled so hard in the first place. Idk love him tho
Truly enjoy your videos. It is great to see what Jeffrey is up to but not surprised at all that he is quitting YouTube. Really thought he had already
I NEED THESE VIDOES SOONER THAN A WEEK! I AM DYINGGGGG
Jeffree, uts nit that people aren't watching YouTube, it that they aren't watching you. People are enjoying so much content now.  Comedy podcasts are a huge deal since covid.people are still watching true crime, skin care, etc. I think people just get tired of you doing and saying the same stuff every video, release after release. It gets old after 5+ years. Like TV shows, they do great the first few seasons and then they just get redundant and ridiculous. Some people still watch because they've already invested so much time in a series but many people lose interest because the storyline. Just because one person loses interest in something doesn't mean everyone does. Just because jeffree wears makeup doesn't mean everyone does, just because jeffree isn't making videos doesn't mean everyone left youtube to go to tiktok.
I watch youtube everyday haha i’m so confused
I mean Jeffree is kinda right. Youtube is kinda dead. I have like 10000 videos on my "watch later" and I just cant find the interest or time to watch them, even tho I want to. By the time I get to them they are always deleted or hidden. Many great ones have left either by being harassed to quit by all this cancel culture sht or fearing they gonna get canceled for something they said or did 20 years ago when we all were so young... Its sad, but kinda true.
I cried. I enjoy his videos. He got me through so much 😢
Stop😭I want this 2nd palette so bad!
I basicly cry when He say " he gonna leave youtube ... " man i watch everything reveal and conversation , its my dinner company. Whyyyyyy . No 😣
Jeffrey looks like a different person, he looks do happy!!
When Jeffree said “no one watches YouTube” lowkey felt some type of way because here’s how many people watching them currently? Like just because not as many are viewing doesn’t mean you should basically disrespect the fans y’all actually do got. DO BETTER.
Loved the video! Honesty it’s true tho people attention spans are fucked because of TikTok!
OK BUT JEFFERY i love youtube!!!!!! i love youuuu i’m so glad you are gonna do what makes you happy but damn :(
i fucking love jeffree
I can't stop looking at Jeffrey's skin with no makeup, beautiful. 😊
NOOOOO 😭😭😭😭 I was hoping for jeffree vlogs not him quitting 💔💔  both your videos/ YouTube accounts make me happy😢
Shane, Please dont leave Youtube. You keep us going who cant afford all the movie apps :)
But its true, for myself, i have been watching youtube i.e my fav youtubers upload, religiously everyday since 2007, but 6 months before the pandemic started, started busineses and it took off quick, and left me no time for youtube anymore, come in off and on just to catch up with my favs latest vids , and it seems oddly strange that , youtube have become bland...comparing to other media outlet....i dont know whether due to age restrictions , the creators had to glide along the guideline so that their vids can be monitzed leaving contents becoming   less and less edgy following safe paths ..... i dont know maybe its just me
im still watching :( youtube is still my life. i miss you so much shane, please dont stop <3
I would have to agree with Jeffree I find myself on here less and less but when I saw that you two had a new little series I had to watch 😉
1.4 Mil views in a day? youtube isn’t dead yet! we are still here to see you Shane!
I’m literally only on YouTube for pimple popping videos and this series lol I love you guys and you make me want to be a better me ❤️
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
PARANORMAL VIDEO PLSSSSSSSS WITH JEFFREE
The comment about YouTube being dead made me genuinely so sad. I watch YouTube everyday, in the morning, during my lunch break and before going to sleep. I noticed all the YouTubers I have been watching for years started to dissappear or uploading rarely but when they do I watch it within 5h of uploading. I don't think YouTube will ever die for people in their 20s and 30s. I can only speak for myself but YouTube was really important part of my life during teenage and early 20s years. Other than Instagram I don't use any other apps and it's definitely sad to see YouTubers go but if they will decide to come back I'll be here waiting for their content. On more happy note I have noticed some new YouTubers appearing with really interesting content that I'm sure will interest people. I can recommend Coffeehouse crime if you are looking for something new to watch! 😊
Jeffree hanging up his you tube hat makes me so sad. I still watch and prefer the longer videos to short clips. But also I get it
It’s sad because a lot of people nowadays only work with short form media I prefer YouTube because I’d like more lengthy videos I guess it also comes with the generation you grew up with.
Oh no is J Star gonna be the reason I have to join Tik Tok?
People are definitely still watching YouTube , especially the older content that has aged like millllk. Like Shane’s old videos with tana or trevi moran for example.
23:50 why are you showing downtown athens, GA 😭 there’s literally UGA flags
I personally watch YouTube every day. Jeffree don’t leave YouTube xx
What is the outro song?? Cant find in the credits!!!
I love how humble Jeffree has become. You can tell he is genuinely happy inside and out and it shows. This made my heart happy. 💜
Lol no one watches YouTube anymore. While making a YouTube series
Shane and Jeffree doing a paranormal investigation would be AWESOME .. CARRY ON...!!!🙃🙃🙃🙃😉
Nooooo!!! I love Jeffree! I still watch him alot please don't gooooo
I still watch YouTube! 🎉❤
Jeffrey cannot quit!!! im so fkn sad
I personally still watch YouTube. It’s more addicting to me than TikTok.
Jeffree looks SO HAPPY!  I’m sad he doesn’t read the comments because he looks amazing, relaxed, and happy!
wowwwww filtered comments:)))))) ok:)))))))) how wonderful shane:))))))))) queeeen of taking accountability
1.4 M views but no one cares about YouTube no more 🫥 i hope this proves that we all still very much watch YouTube videos and that no one stops making videos because they are definitely appreciated.
Not on 'yakcident'
WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU JEFFREE!!!
I have been such a huge follower of shane and jeffree, no cap. I love their genuine energy. Drama happens all the time i live how they stayed above the cancellation and instead focused on themselves
Glad to have you back Shane I live in Denver and would be a dream to run into you guys sometime 😢❤
I litterly cried when jeffree walked through the door!
Is it just me or was that hummer moment super intense?
By far my favorite YouTube duo! Love you so much Shane!
Jeffree is literally ooozing happiness. I’ve never seen him so happy. I’m bummed about him leaving YouTube but also glad he has other platforms l.
Jeffree at the airport is such a mood
Dope camera shots and editing Chris!   I love y’all 🖤
Uhhh yes pretty please I need a haunted series with you two!!!!
YouTube is only a waste of time if you're doing it just to get attention and the most amount of views... YouTube is more of a time capsule that people should be uploading to for memories, having fun, and following passions. That is what YouTube started as... then people started getting paid and slowly turned YouTube into a shallow place. The best YouTubers literally do not give a crap about money. I watch Andrea Perron do her little episodes with guests and she gets crap all views, she would probably be stoked to get the amount of views Jeffery has, but even though she doesn't, she makes content for the few of us that do watch and that's a special thing. Intimate communities are the best, you can actually talk to the person you watch the most on YouTube and have more meaningful connections to them and their content.  Oh, by the way... Andrea Perron is the women behind the Conjuring film. She wrote the book about her families experiences in the house. You should absolutely make content with her. You'll absolutely fall in love with her Shane.
Maybe I'm a dinosaur but I love YouTube, I watch it daily I'm so sad that creators I love are fleeing to tik tok because I'm not really a fan of its format. I agree with Jeffree that I much prefer in depth content, it's why I don't like tiktok beauty videos as so many are just....look at my naked face wah now boom look at this incredible intricate look that you will have to work out how to create.  Everybody is different and everyone likes different things and I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.  Shane I'm loving this series you have a real talent and I hope you continue on YouTube 😊.
I really hope you guys will release the second palette!!
If leaving youtube will make your life more meaningful, its okay. We gotta take care of our well-being. Unlike Nikita Dragun in a jail doing same old sxxx. You do you Jeffree! xoxo 😇💝
i still love and watch youtube everyday!❤❤
I still watch YouTube! But will admit it is your s, Ryland, Morgan channels the most.  I think you make interesting content still.  Keep it up all of you!!!!
I love this new jeffree!! Sooooo free!!
well y'all hear it here. YouTube sucks and we shouldn't be even wasting our time here.
I love this 💕
Sis has EYEBROWS !! That’s a slay fr cause it just completes him
I thought you were going to announce that you're a polyamorous throuple now with Jeffrey 😂
Aaawww Jeffree…
I've missed this so much
Really sad to know he’s going to leave YouTube. 😢
I love you guys missed you so much so happy !!!!! ❤
I was late to YouTube, but it's mostly all I watch. I have  so much respect for Jeffree. I love the person who he has become. He is definitely living his best life right now! Things don't make the person, so I am glad to see that he is truly happy!
I just want to say that I am so in love with this series, it's so amazing,  and truly full of emotions.  I just hope Jeffree NEVER quits YouTube.. i know it might not seem like it, but, I care. I care so, so much. Literally watch YouTube while drinking my morning coffee then when I'm winding down after work I hope it never dies down. YouTube is my #1 face place to watch.  Its so RAW and real. Please Shane &Jeffree NEVER give up
https://youtube.com/channel/UCZKmkM2cfUq0tWeCnuTHF9A
“Because of my cancellation, his makeup ended up at Tj Maxx. And we’re still friends, soooo” ☠️☠️☠️☠️
YouTube is not dead. I love it so so much!!!!!
21:49 Jeffree has very good trigger discipline.
I’m not going to lie I’m devastated but if Jeffree is happy, all power to him but I’ll miss his videos for sureee. Been with Shane and Jeffree since day one and watching them grow and succeed has been a pleasure. You have been a really big part of my life and that sounds dramatic but watching YouTube is a big release for me (mental health wise) so thank you both for everything ❤❤❤
JStar… you say you’re in a really good place 🤔 But your ego & hatefulness -to say YouTube is dead. Youtube sucks. Nobody cares about Youtube. Not good enough for you 2m people care. Hell no. If not 20m. You cry and quit.
He’s not wrong. I haven’t been on YouTube for months until this series
Shane is genuinely the funniest person...sometimes unintended like the Gucci shoes in the gym lol
Everybody watching this on youtube is like… ummm, me and the 1.3m people are not nobodies.
WHAAAAAT!!! Jeffrey is quitting YouTube!!!! My heart is broken 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow 🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈
NOW WE'RE OVRLOOKING ALL THE SHIT SHANE DID?????
I cant get over the 600 acres 😨😨🤯🤯
Awh jeffree for a viewer of you for many years ill miss your videos❤☹ wishing you all the best in life 💗
I am so shocked and sad Jeffree quitting utube. Shane I am loving the series. Welcome back!!!! I hope you release the pallet.
Popat Ho Gya 😂 https://youtu.be/PSFndgFvpFk
Erm… I still watch YouTube 🙋🏼‍♀️
honestly jeffrees new life is way more life goals for me than his old one ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jeffrey looks, idk.. healthier? Also him with a bare face, eyebrows, not as ultra plumped up lips looks good on him
NO HE CANT STOP YOUTUBE I LOVE WATCHING HIS VIDEOS! 😭
Wait a min. Is he using dr Sheerin Idris skin line? ♥️♥️♥️♥️
😍😍😍😍
this is just so sad and melancholy at this point
“No one watches anymore” 1.3 million of us: 😳
So horrible that he KILLS animals now, and he doesn't even do it for a living
Youtube would be worth going to if it wasn’t for the insane amount of adverts that they force you to watch. Gone are the days of one ad that you could skip after five seconds. Youtube is dying and its not only because of tiktok- its because they’ve got greedy.
So happy JS finally found himself! 👏
*Shane stop hunching down so much ur getting kyphosis*
So glad to see Jeffree so happy ❤️
I watch YouTube….Jeffree just confirmed my fear…I’m nobody😭🤣
Love you guys seriously! The grounding and work to find the peace yall have done is so beautiful ❤ side note, I always watch YouTube! So sad to hear js leaving it. 😔
6:48 :( Animal agriculture and meat is the LAST thing that any rich and influential person should be investing in. "He doesn't eat the yaks that he names"... hmmm yes it's almost like you don't want to send animals you care about to a slaughterhouse! Guess why - because it's cruel, barbaric, inhumane, unnecessary, and is also one of the biggest contributors to climate change. Personally I unsubbed to Jeffree when the news broke that he was in the meat business, and the same will be the case for a lot of vegans and environmentalists. It's obvious that his make-up products are cruelty-free just as a money-making scheme, as he clearly doesn't actually care about animals whatsoever. Only when they can make him money.
That end part no one watches YouTube anymore- looking at the numbers they have dropped drastically. I have always watched and will always watch as long as my favourite creators are still on this platform. I love watching this style of content, the educational and the deep dive. I hope the social media doesn’t turn only into short instant gratification style videos and there’s no option for longer content 😢
I fricken love y'all so much!!! been watching y'all since the age of 15. and I only watch the OG videos and series, y'all really hold a very special in my heart. And the fact y'all got away from the city life and just living y'all life without the bright lights and being really humble always inspire me. Shane, Ryan, Jeffree y'all look fresh and relax and so humble and no matter what keep doing y'all!!! I love y'all in my middle school stages, before cancellation and after and still love y'all. please don't leave
Living in the middle of nowhere like that would make me feel soooooo Apprehensive just in case something where to happen helps not comming and where the hell can you go if you need help
this looks pretty much staged and thoroughly planned though he claims it isn’t 😅😅😅😅😅 cringe
For someone who claims to suffer from misophonia Shane sure leaves in a lot of smacking sounds of whenever Jeffree speaks w his mouth full......... i have to skip large parts of the video because of this honestly i might just watch someone elses summary on the next episode bc of this or drop the series altogether
Jeff is right. I barely come here anymore. And when i do the video suggestions dont feel personalized as much as they were before, even though im still subscribed to the same channels. I watch the podcast and a few other stuff and thats it. Im watching more series and when im bored and feel like scrolling i go on tiktok which is doing an amazing job at personalizing the content. So yeah TIME TO REINVENT and see how you can fit yourselves in the current wave.
You know what I love about Shane and Jeffree together, is that they are so naturally fun, funny, & they make the audience feel like you are there with them, these two have no filter and go with the flow, and I love it! I love their humor!!!
Jeffreee is living ❤
SHANE DON'T YOU DARE QUIT YOUTUBE BECAUSE US MENTALLY UNSTABLE ADULTS NEED YOU
Me watching this on YouTube like.... Oh.
I love YouTube and I look for Shane and Ryland all the time. But what Jeffreee dont realize maybe ppl dont click because of the way he was got old but  I think ppl would love his true real self now and maybe ppl need to know his hows he got to his new place in life. But if that is what he needs than good for him. But Shane dont you leave you are one of the person who got me here. Love you and the fam.
JS videos used to get 5-14 million views. Now he gets 1M, if that. YouTube is over saturated and kinda boring
i can easily see this becoming one of my comfort videos.
YouTube is still what I watch the most. Sad to see him leave. 💔
Jeffrey looks so so good with his short hair and eyebrows :D and very healthy and also his energy changed <3
Aww I love YouTube.
Me sitting on my couch after a 16 hour shift eating carrots watching this 😒😐 does that make me lame?! 😩🖤
I think Jefree has hit the main quest. Everything is just side quests now.
It was upsetting to hear Jeffree quitting YT. If I lost Shane I can't even think about it!!!! :(
Looking forward to watching the other part/parts to this mini series
This is video y'all are looking for.  https://youtu.be/zhSsnMP5EbM
i agree with what jeffree said, youtube just isnt the same anymore. back in 2019, youtube was really at its prime and now it just doesn't hit the same anymore
Why, is everyone getting these shitty dogs ... for real,the bark on everything even flys ... because they are scared of everything poor dogs i wish the world had never done this mistakes ...
I do think YouTube sucks when it comes to the beauty world now, it’s all on tik tok. But for someone like Shane who makes 30-60 min long documentary style videos.. there isn’t another platform to really put those on right now.
Why Jefree on an animals back..:(
I watch youtube every evening!!
Jeffrey is the definition of a bad bitch 💅😱🖤if you don't carry some type of weapon in your car or know how to protect yourself can you even really call yourself a baddie?
I love when u or Jeffree post. I watch every video. I really hope he doesn’t stop posting and changes his mind. I still watch YouTube everyday. ❤
Not true I watch YouTube everyday. Jeffrees content just sucks lol. It was good when Shane collabed
I think it's mostly the "younger" generation that's not watching YouTube...but I still watch it every day and I don't even have Tik Tok so don't forget about the people that are still here watching 🥺🙏
I hope you got mental help for your pedophilia thoughts and struggles. Hurt people continue to hurt people. People will only feel sorry for your struggles until you become your abuser. You can delete this comment, just wanted you to know I used to be a fan of yours because I was abused like you, and I always coped with shock comedy, but you brought it to a whole new level man. Also your money and views of the world got to your head. Hope you don't ever act on your sickness and get help. Best of luck to you
So I have a idea .... Release the makeup and make it $5 so everyone here can buy it. I think you could redeem yourself. There are so many comments on both of your channels of people that say they have never been able to to afford it. If it's not a cash grab and you truly want people to have it then make it cheaper.
Jeffrey said, "Pull a Jenna Marbles....." (and leave YouTube)....... But that scares me because Jenna didn't just leave YouTube, she's been MIA from the internet completely. Like not even any photos or written posts/updates from her. I hope Jeffrey doesn't do that and I also hope Jenna comes back!!!!
I felt that when Jeffrey said, "Nobody clicks on YouTube anymore"....... I do feel like TikTok has kind of taken over. But as much as I understand that people need to go where they'll make money and be able to sustain their lifestyle....I also hope they'll stick around on these older apps as well because I feel like it's still such a great platform to be able to get info quickly, connect with others, and have access to basically free entertainment. The politics of YouTube suck for sure, but that's kind of to be expected with any big company. I think the creators could stick it to YouTube big wigs even better by continuing to get sponsorships and creating content. I think podcasts have become as big as they have as a direct result of YouTube sensoring things to the extreme and not supporting creators, plus decreasing their pay scale. I give mad respect to those creators who looked outside the box and found ways to continue on YouTube. With that said, I wouldn't blame Jeffrey for leaving. He's always been more of business minded person and not necessarily a strictly YouTube dreamer and content creator. I have always looked up to him for that fact, and how much his entrepreneurial spirit shines through regardless of what he's taking on. Some may call that "greed" or something similar, but I call it drive....... desire to succeed in whatever you do..... etc.
I definitely didn’t trust Shane with that gun in his hand 💀😂
This video made me so unbelievably happy❤️ it’s so nice to see them come out of the other side of the drama, everyone’s so content with life it’s amazing ❤
“As long as you don’t use they and then you’ll be fine, right fellas?”😂😂
I think it’s because Jeffree used to get at least 5-10 Million views per video back before the pandemic happened, now even though he’s getting about 1 Million views, it doesn’t feel like it’s enough compared to before when he was super popular on YT back around 2017-2019
Im not really sure what is the purpose and message of this series. Unless they release the palette in the end, its not really showing anything. Also Rylands face when Jeffree Says that YT is cancelled and nobody watches it but its Rylands main source of content - priceless 😂😂😂 and one moment later Ryland instead of defending his Mind, goes to mode "yeah, everything is Changing". Or is it just me who sees it that waym
YouTube isn't dead. I can't relate to Jeffrey Star and never liked all the drama and shit he was
I'm crushing hard on jeffree in this video. Ranch life makes him look so sexy and I've never felt that way about him all these years of being a fan (straight woman🙋‍♀️)
To be honest JS is the last thing this sad world needs - but the town of CHILLINGBOURNE shines a light.
I will say I spend most of my free time watching/listening to YouTube videos lol
Going the way of the Grav3yardgirl, I see. 😉
I have so many thoughts. First of all I’m very proud of you both for overcoming the cancellation and for being in a good state mentally. Quitting YouTube was such a shock but y’all are right. It’s not like a lot of people use it. The world changes and it’s very scary but do what you gotta do to be happy it’s all that matters
1.3million views in 24hrs.  I don't think YouTube is dead.  It doesnt 'suck' sorry jeffree!
i feel like this needs to be a way more videos then this!!!
I'm loving this series. It brings back so many memories of past YouTube! We need longer videos then 30 second clips.
i'm still watching..........i still watch and will watch youtube everyday 🥺🤧
Hey! We’re still watching YouTube! We can’t just let the kids take over with their stupid TikTok!
Need the Wyoming paranormal video asap
Both these canceled clowns are boring and no one cares about them anymore Mr clown makeup got humble after is crash and the only reason he moved there was because of the Kardashians and the only reason shane is filming is because he has no more money sorry not sorry
Icônic
I agree with what Jeffree is saying, YouTube is dead. Tiktok is new wave for now. I’m surprised I’m even on YouTube keeping up with this series
im so sad jeffree went from bags to killing yaks ... rip
Love you Jeffree Star ⭐️ 💖 ive always admired how strong and extra he is and how he is so confident in doing it all I’ve followed him since myspace and to see where hes gotten himself to this day in 2022 is AMAZING beyond words!!! YOU GO GLENN COCO!💓
What’s the tl;dr?
Starting a petition for Jeffree to name his arcade “The Starcade” ✨
The scorpio of it all I’m just gonna say that lol 💜
All I watch is YouTube. We don't subscribe to one single streaming service. The wifi where our house is will not support it. (We still have cable too.) Maybe certain audiences are going in that direction, but many are still very happy here. PS: I want yak videos.  PPS: Jeffree looks different. Like he actually goes outside and has normal person skin coloring. Not to be mean, but he really looks happy and relaxed like a totally different person. I am very happy for him, and where do I get the stuffed yak? LOL!
Jefreeeee
Love Jeffree. He’s such an example of personal growth. That alone is a reason why I hope his YouTube channel never disappears. Even if he stops making videos, his channel wil be an epic archive of entrepreneurship and inspirational personal growth.
That end was rough
I love seeing them happy and enjoying spending time hanging out. I love Shane and Jeffree and I have stayed a fan through all the controversies and drama, they have both admitted to mistakes they have made and have put up with so much hate thrown at them that was so undeserved. I want all of them happy and to succeed in whatever they put their minds to. Shane and Rylan and Jeffree and all of the floof babies!
Will always be the queen of YouTube Jeffrey
Hi😊
I missed you guys so much! This series is like fresh air,
John 3:16-18    Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God and your souls
Love how Jeffree included Chris. Sometimes it's hard fitting in with mutual friends that already have history and are established. That was sweet how he would bring him in and make sure he felt a part of the conversations too.
22:45 this moment was really about to be a whole new title of this episode  “The Murder of Jeffrey Star”
THE SILENCER ON THE GUN
I love this comeback! I can see how happy is jeffrey now with his life..a lot happier!
I love Wyoming!!!  Its so beautiful there  ❤️ I camped out there at the grand Tetons iits soo beautiful
slaaay chris is doubled masked
That is true about YouTube. This is the first thing I’ve watched on YouTube in forever! And I only came here to watch this because I saw a clip on TikTok.
YouTube isn’t dead it isn’t dying , the gen Jeffery blew up in the teens are just growing up … it happened with prankvsprank and jennamarb and other content creators people are just growing up
Flop
Meanwhile I’m here watching hours of YouTube everyday still, and finding good content is harder and harder.   Just because another platform is getting more traction it does not mean there’s no people expecting long format videos other than movies or series.   I’m still right here where u left me 🥲
Forget the platform, Jeffree is funny and entertaining and I enjoy watching him
Bruh I still watch YouTube 🤣
I think hearing "YouTube is dead, no one watches it anymore" really hit me because I'm still on this app daily watching all my favs. As a fan, I already lost Jenna. I'm scared the rest are going to slowly disappear too and that's just depressing. I walked away from this video really sad, I'll admit.
Loved everything about this video! Jeffree is hot 🔥 Shane was literally hot with all that sweat on his white jacket! Haha, so glad this series is out!! Much love ❤️ 😍
Literally only have YouTube download on my phone anymore bcuz of Shane Dawson  !!! I understand what Jeffree is saying but don't let it discourage you Shane. We're here for you! Die hard fans!!!
Shane really credited EVERY song except the one we actually wanted to find... Sugarsweet by Zach Sorgen- thank me later
Lol who else is watching this from Wyoming
I only watch youtube. I like real.
Jeffrey star is so funny amd i forgot honestly..I love this updated version of him! Love him! And of course Shane and my family watches YouTube constantly so I don't really agree with YouTube being dead
Jeffrey Star leaving YouTube is like Steve Job leaving apple.
Idk if this will help anyone but I sweat so much to.it’s just hot hot hot and dry where I live in Hawaii and I found a brand called “carpe” I started using it on my face and omg game changer. Deodorants work great to!! Not trying to advertise but if anyone also suffers from sweating as much as Shane and I. Look it up lol
I just had to come back a day later to comment on Shane's supposed "cancelation" , this mf is #2 on trending. All y'all angry and upset and decided to hate on him because of the random shit posted 2 years ago, from 10 years ago that "cancelled" him,  how's it feel to be proved wrong? Shane always has and always will be the king of YouTube and you can feel differently, but the face that this is *#2 on trending* proves you wrong. Supporter since the begining and always will be. Love you Shane no matter what the loud minority may have to say against that. The people love you, listen to your fans, not your haters. Wishing you nothing but the best and to everyone who says otherwise, you can go ahead and just watch someone else. Just know you are missing out.
Damn when you think about it Star is right. YouTube while still great for Artist overall. Now as the previous generation of YouTubers are slowly going away it’s becoming dull. As times change so do people. I mean Jeffree is pushing 40 and has done it all literally!
Fuck I can't lose another I miss Jenna I I don't watching Shane and Jeffree stars, since I was like, 13, it's just gonna be so sad, another good person lost, I always watch YouTube I'm always here
I don't think I'd ever stop watching Shane & the gang honestly. Ive grown up with them and they are like family now. I still get excited whenever they post and will save it for that night when I'm alone and can give it my full attention, even if it's just a vlog. You guys got tons more to document in your lives so please don't feel like you should stop because there's so many of us anxiously waiting for the next video. we care.  I haven't seen much of Jeffree stars videos but I think he's really funny and clearly always on the go. Hopefully he continues to have that happy life he's after. He's got lots of company haha
Jeffree: "no one watches, no one cares" Shane: gets 1.2 million views in a day
Well that’s sad. An era has come to an end. I totally loved all their videos. Never bought anything. But I did enjoy these 2 crazy wonderful peoples chemistry. And I will miss it. 😢 and he is right. 4 million views just going to a mall. Now you can’t get a like for your life. So why bother. He doesn’t need us. We needed him. It’s a sad day.
I missed Shane and Jeffree on YouTube.
When Jeffrey said “ we are wasting our f$)/&ing time” I felt that.
These fake af comments.
Don’t leave YouTube guys
came to hate watch low-key but they actually look happy compared to how they used to be
YouTube is not dead so many are still watching look at the numbers 🎉
I like Shane being back, but Jeffree is a nope for me.
As a long time fan of Jeffree Star -- honey, you've never looked better.. you have such a glow and I'm so happy to see you so happy.
slow media is good for my productivity. i cook a meal and listen to people i've listened to for years, and i like seeing their reactions etc so youtube and twitch are like my happy place.
Please do paranormal content with Jeffree pretty please with whipped cream and a cherry on top. I love everything you two do together
YouTube is definitely not dead
imagine having so much money you don't care about one of the income sources because you have enough to retire :D
YouTube is not dead. The creators are not serving as well as they used to. There a plenty of channels still attracting the metrics of 2019. The first Shane/Jeffree series did so well because everyone was so enthralled by the volume of money in Jeffries closets and house. Without that, there’s not enough high performing content to appeal to such a broad audience. This is now niche content - you’ll get a niche audience to match. Don’t blame the platform or the audience.
so glad that after all the chaos, misery, and exploitation Jeffree committed on others, he’s able to retire peacefully and without any messy accountability or amends 😊
Jeffrey looks so healthy now! ❤ The throwback clips you can tell he was in a dark place…
I AM CONSTANTLY GLUED TO MY PHONE CHECKING YOUR CHANNEL FOR NEW CONTENT EVERY WEEK SHANE. NEVER QUIT! WE ARE STILL HERE!
At the beginning of thus video- I was so happy to be in my comfort zone watching Shane again  and then seeing Shane with Jeffree was just so sweet, I don’t have cable … YouTube is my cable, I watch it every day and then hit at the end really hurt my heart  I’m gonna miss Jeffree videos  I don’t have TikTok because I have Instagram reels If I need to I can just rewatch of the Jeffree star videos I guess
I love this more grounded jeffree
Please jeffree don't leave YouTube as you are the reason why I still watch YouTube these days. You, Shane and Ryland are the  reason I still watch YouTube
The Cancer/Scorpio thing is amazing.
Why did I get tears when Jeffree said he was gonna quit YouTube?
Did he change the title?
Hearing JS quiting YT made me really sad.. It will be really different without Jeffee.
Im- the words arent here. Im shook fr
Jeffree is so funny
I literally only come to YouTube to watch Shane, Ryan and family
Omg when the clip of someone seeing Shane at the store and saying that about him on a tiktok I got so emotional.. Like that's just such a fucked up thing to do to anyone.
wow, this gun is so unnecessary
the way they can look dead into the camera (subbing in for all of us plebs) and assume we won't see directly through the thinly veiled uwu bullshit, thinking we won't all realize this is just another long-form ad, is just plain insulting.
All I have to say is this is ICONIC ❤🎉
I need Jeffree to send his jerky to West Virginia 🥺🥺🥺🖤
When he free said two more videos and I’m done. It’s really the end of an era. 😩😩
I miss YouTube
How is everyone so 🔥 like absofuckinglutely KINGS
sooo no one’s gonna talk about the g*n with a silencer being waved around 😭
Jeffree was wrong for saying youtube is dead cause there is millions of people who still watch it
Haven’t been on YouTube for 6 months , as soon as this video popped out I had to watch!! Love the series to be honest !!
I love YouTube it’s the main app I use it’s sad YouTubers are stopping that I love 😭
Shane, please don’t leave YouTube
Shane and a hand full of other people are all I watch on YouTube but mostly only get on here when I don't know how to do something and need a tutorial. I gotta be in the mood for youtube
The ending was so true but sad. Few days back I wanted to purchase a product and I was looking for Jeffree’s review. But it’s true. It would be greedy to expect Jefree to stay here while we move on. I just hope you are the happiest in your life. And we love you.
I've always loved yallzez videos :}
A lot of youtubers that have been in it for decades are gradually moving on to other things/ platforms to keep them inspired. Simply nail logical moved to twitch, Jeffrey is moving to tiktok.. All of that is fine and good. Doesn't mean youtube is dead.
I still look forward to watching new YouTube videos 😢
Never thought I’d see jeffree star do burnouts
I don't think so. Maybe beauty channels are dead? YouTube is still awesome!! Lots of us are still loyal fans of Shane and Ryland's channels.  I watch every video u guys put on 💞💞💞
so happy and proud of both of you!! The growth you both have made is amazing to see☺️❤️
The Shane tiktok 😅😂
Oh my god. That ended so… abrupt.
Jeffree looks amazing! Happy and healthy.
I love seeing Jeffery so happy and at peace. I love seeing you guys together
youtube is relevant for me and my friends still. to hear that some of the youtubers i’ve been watching for years might stop posting hurts 🥺
This kind of collaboration makes me want to watch YouTube 😊 hoping to see more of you. More series ❤️
I still watch youtube everyday before bed.. it breaks my heart to see it going down . To me it’ll never get old. There’s still so much more to film and do.
Man... grasshoppers sound so similar to rattlesnakes though. Be careful because it's a bit hard to tell them apart unless you spot them.
I need this ghost 👻 content like yesterday plz🤌🙏
I watch YouTube DAILY for content!!!!:,(
Seriously between you Shane, Rylan ,and Jeffree y'all have helped me in so much depression. So keep that in mind friends
Not me choking on my Mac n cheese Jeffree saying " nobody" first of all some of us still love you. Im bawling , pure tears. I love watching all of you. My heart is broken
It's kind of wild that this starts off as "Hey, so guys, drama. We made a palette that wasn't released and let's talk about it." To Jeffree like "Hey. Here's a grenade. Byeeee" I swear we never know what we are getting with these series'.  How is the Über there and Ryland looks like he was in the middle of eating?  Shane, you better believe if you ever come for Christy Carlson Romano that she will come for your life.  I was half expecting after shane was reading the "fit over 50" magazine and him asking Chris "notice anything different about me." For Chris to say "Your deteriorating (or supple) joints?" Missed opportunity Chris.  If they do release or name the unreleased palette "canceled" I'm going to sue them for the most clumsiest name possible. There has to be a law in this god damn country that would back me in this.   Shane, as a fellow sweat-er - Gotta go with moisture wicking everything. Jackets, shirts. Just constant air flow.  Awww look Chris is the only one on the plane with a mask on. It's weird, it's like he's aware that we are STILL IN A PANDEMIC. Unlike, literally everyone else. But fuck everyone with a compromised immune system, right?   Chris sleeps like an exhausted angel.   I really hope that tiktok of shane isn't real. Because that's fucked up people.  The gun thing was frightening but funny but also frightening because that beretta looked cocked...  Also, reading between the lines - Jeffree seems to be leaning towards protecting his privacy A LOT. And he references not letting people know so much about his life, or where he lives. Like I know he lived in a gated community before with private security but it sounds like he hires his own for his ranch. Which is in the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles. In one of the least populated states... Guns everywhere... I feel like some things happened related to his safety???  But Jeffree does say when he does something he does it hard.   And that ending. Part of me feels like that was too quick an ending for the bomb that was dropped but at the same time it felt appropriate. End on not just that news, but the message and frustration behind it: Youtube - at least the culture that bloomed around it - is dying. If not already dead. And that's really sad. As someone who has been using this platform from its inception... it's sad every time I think about it. That gold age we got to witness - that shane got to experience - with all its ups and downs - is gone. Pretty heartbreaking... and frustrating.   But I think it's important to listen that Jeffree keeps saying "maybe." He still says he likes longer form educational content. So the passion isn't gone. But someone as experienced as him can tell when something isn't working.   Can't wait until the next video.
You took the words right out of my mouth with Ryland and the Elton John look-alike😅❤
I think YouTube has definitely changed. The way people vlog is so different now and not as interesting as it was before Covid. I definitely don’t watch YouTube as much anymore.
The gun with the silencer took me out LMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That jacket in your sponsor bit is fireeee!!
We are still here
YouTube is the only app I use now.
Omg Jeffreee we love your videos 😭
video bad did not like
So.. I don't use social media much or anything. But this is kinda weird...I love YouTube. I use it everyday. (Mostly for true crime videos) but I used to always watch Jeffrey. And its true, I just stopped watching him one day. I stopped clicking. Something about him was just giving me bad vibes, idk it's hard to explain. I think he's hilarious. I guess the makeup scene just doesn't interest me much anymore.
A real friendship is when you can pick things up anytime .... even after it’s been years and everything is still the same.  so blessed to have some of those kind of friends.  :D
😭😭😭I still watch YouTube, daily. So sad to see all the OGs leaving. If it makes you happy to step away, many blessing. I will miss you.
Oh my gosh stoppppp you can’t quit making videos jeffree!!! make videos for me!! I’m 26 years old and I still love YouTube. For recipes, for reviews, to watch you!!! Ugh just no
We need Shane to bring back the conspiracy theory videos
I'm crying
A Shane and Jeffree show is what we all need. I love seeing y’all together.
He’s not sick is he??? I’m scared
10:37 I seriously thought Shane was singing
Jeff just looks so so happy and it makes my younger fan self so content
Jeffree fucking roasting casper is accurate god being gay there fucking SUCKS
“As long as you don’t use they and then you’ll be fine”  I died haha
Cheetah flip rc car https://youtube.com/shorts/WuwFJde51Ts?feature=share
Jeffree kept morphe on the map they should have sold his yak in their stores lol jk
I think it’s pretty funny that “The Surprise” is Jeffree quitting youtube saying it’s dead & nobody watches it anymore.. for Youtube to then put this video as #1 trending on Youtube 🤣
i mean i’ll buy the pallet if you release it 👀 who cares what people say
When he said how should we dress for Casper I cackled my extended family lives there, basic normal clothes work, small town very small. And then if you wear ANYTHING flashy you will stick out like a sore tbh. I love but hate Casper.
Iconic Duo! You guys did that!! You should be proud of yourselves! I'm happy to see you guys evolving! Xx
Waittttt Jeffree is so funny! I love this new Jeffree!
Jeffree with eyebrows 😍
I’m still alive, he got gayer 😂😂😂😂
I think YouTube is definitely in a low right now.... but I still DAILY watch YouTube before bed. It's a must. I am a routine girl and YouTube is part of that! Pjs, watch YouTube an hour or two, read, go to sleep!
Bruhhh I just noticed that jeffree has eyebrows again
B happy do u. Everyone watching YouTube here like confused 🤔  I prefer this over other platforms just saying.
I'm saddened by Jeffree's statement about YouTube fizzling. I'm sure he's referring to having thousands instead of millions of views/subscribers and that's not enough for him. It hurts as an avid fan to hear that the most loyal don't matter, because its a numbers game for him.
Youtube viewership is about the same, peoples choices of content has just changed. We're simply bored of boring videos, how entertaining what poking eyeshadows palettes gonna stay realistically?
It makes me so happy knowing jeffrey is leaving youtube in a happy place and not from being cancelled
I'm over here in youtube daily & barely open my tiktok 😬😮‍💨
No one is on YouTube, yet Mr. Beast pulls 100m views per video. People are on YouTube still, they're just not watching the same content they were 2-3 yrs ago.
Jeffree has a creative mind, he is an Architect, he was born to build stuff, so it's not surprising to me that he moves on to something new. Like he said, he already did it all on Youtube. And good for him that he is living a more grounded life, far away from the parasites and materialistic mind of L.A.
It's  crazy to hear what Jeffery said about YouTube and no one is clicking because YouTube is like my Netflix, Disneyplus, etc.
I’m so sad. YouTube is my main source of entertainment. Am I alone in this? Am I just a dinosaur lol. Actually watching this series is bringing back such nostalgia. Like pre-pandemic 😔
OK So I'm here now Just started watching and I'll give u my honest opinion when I'm finished so BRB lol
I think you and Jeffree should do more videos together. Bring life back into the UTube. Going to miss him if he does quit Tube, but I get it. Been following him since MySpace, follow him on Instagram, which I only spend like 1-3hrs max a year on. -_- and not on any other socials. too busy working to kill time on them. I binge my favorite utubers before bed, in the shower, or on weekends when I'm taking a lazy day and doing nothing.
This is making me so happy to see you all having this reunion. I'm like actually crying to the thought of losing your videos and YOU on YouTube. Makeup might not be what we jump to on here for but I still spend more time on YouTube then any other app. I love seeing and relating to your life. I do in so many ways. I've watched you for more then 10 years. It doesn't matter if you post once a year or a couple times in a week EVERY single video you put out I'm 100% there watching it because of how much love I have for your entertainment skills. That includes your podcast and just sharing your life. I know its hard... I love you and Ryan more then you'll ever know. I have so much respect for you <3
How have we allowed things to get this bad?
The one thing I never thought I’d see…Jeffree using a tailgate😂😂 I’m here for it!
Hope Shane doesn’t step in Yak Poop in his Gucci shoes!!
No one clicking 9.2k comments
But I want the pallet
Ugh there's so so many of us who still watch and enjoy youtube. We aren't pointless. We are here and watch every single time you upload
Why does Jeffree have a silencer on that gun 😭😭
I really hope they’re still selling Weirdo and cremated because I WANT THEM. I literally had no idea all these great pallets came out. Except orgy I knew about that one lol. Jeffrey, YouTube hasn’t fizzled out. YouTube just likes to shadow ban “controversial” people for reals and it totally ruins peoples careers. I still watch everyone I love daily. No hate but I haven’t seen any of your videos advertised since the controversy happened with Shane. It’s nothing you’re doing it’s the higher ups and it’s so fucked up. Like I can tell how messed up the algorithm is because I have to actively search out the YouTubers I love to watch them. It’s annoying as hell. So yeah. Just know it’s not you.
No one cares get off the internet
I haven’t been paying attention to Shane much on the podcast or elsewhere in a while but I will always tune in to a Shane Dawson YouTube series!! I needed this right now!
Not a huge fan of this stuff. Always kind of watched this over my lady shoulder. Shane your a cool person. Keep doing you and you will be happy in life.
I’m still here clicking for you Shane!
😫😩😭😭 wait what 😭😭😩
the way chris kept saying the dogs were so cute warmed my heart 😭😭😭
We are still here watching Shane
Shane is here to end YouTube.
when did you fly?? i was at denver airport in september omg
Everyone on YouTube watching this 👁👄👁
I'm happy for Jeffree. But to be honest I'm surprised he has been able to get by as a man wearing those long ass nails in Wyoming. I know during my 6 years living there they aren't very LGBTQ+ accepting. And surely not to a man in full makeup dressed in unisex clothing in a wig with long acrylic nails.  I'm actually happy Wyoming doesn't require a license to carry and you can have a gun sitting in the passenger seat as you drive down the road. And a cop can pull up next to you and won't even bat a eye. Try that in Los Angeles or in Iowa where we lived for many years for Minnesota. Nope you are getting pulled out of your car and laying with your face in the dirt if you did that anywhere besides a few lose gun law states.
Um I love YouTube wtf 🤬 don’t go jeffrreeeeeeeee
So heartwarming
Also I have always LOVED both you and Jeffree, but this was refreshing. You both seem so much happier.
We need to keep the Shane and Jeffree series coming! YouTube is like a reality show where we can continue to connect with them and it feels like we’re hanging out on their journey.
Now what i need is for you guys to announce you're actually doing the canceled pallette
It’s crazy I used to hop on this app all the time now I’ve seen everything and the new people here aren’t funny or interesting I’ll stick w my old YouTubers but I wish I could go back to when I first found them it’s such a Christmas morning feeling😪
I still use YouTube for Shane Dawson only whether it’s new stuff or old so he’s got a point 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
Love seeing you two back together!
I'm sorry but this camera man sucks lol, every shot is shaky and pointless
What? I still watch youtube! I look forward to certain posts
Honestly I think I watch more YouTube than netflix,primevideo and all my other apps
Stop I’m getting sad 🥺 I’ll miss both of you two if you left Fr Fr
The way you can literally see Jeffrey being at peace ❣️❣️🫶🏻🫶🏻
Am I the only one who absolutely loves this side of Jeffree!! I am obsessed with him now!! I love the realness ❤️ and he is glowing with happiness 😊
I’m loving the new series!!
For the record, YouTube is still my platform of choice! Never give up if it gives you joy. If it doesn't though, then for sure leave it behind.
"When the depression stopped, the Pomeranians stopped... " As the daughter of a hoarder, who used to hoard dogs... I busted out laughing at this. Truly a thing.  I have one pom, her name is Bijou. 🥰
I WANT MOREEEEEEEE IM IN LOVE SHANE AND JEFFREE HAVE DONE SO WELL <3333
Not calling it a “Starcade” seems like a missed opportunity 😮‍💨
Just saying I still want the Conspiracy pallete and would love and new Shanexjeffree one just saying....
Who has used Jeffree skin?? Thoughts on it?
I genuinely love YouTube still. Short form videos are fun sometimes, but they don't entertain me like this does.
My aunt lives in Casper! That’s so crazy lol
It’s crazy to me that big YouTubers think it’s dying out. Like literally all everyone I know watches YouTube on the daily. We want more content there just isn’t any.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Wait... People don't watch YouTube like TV anymore? I literally only watch YouTube lol
Shane me representa cuando me subo al avión jajaja
🤍🤍🤍
Love seeing the Wyoming appreciation
4 years??? Sheesh time is really flying. We need to get our lives together.
I’m clicking
I still watched YouTube and I love watching my faves. It's bad enough we lost Jenna 💔 😞 don't go!
Honestly I would watch Jeffree stream video games or makeup or whatever on Twitch XD
I love YouTube though. 😢
I love Jeffree and wish him the best after YT. I agree with Shane, I don't think I have gone 1 day in the last 6 years without watching Youtube and i'm not slowing down. I alo use the music app everyday. Youtube is very much alive. CAn't wait to see the rest of the series!! Love to you all!
I am so excited to see where this series goes! Ever since conspiracy came out it is the only palette of mine that I use and wear every day! I hope this series ends with the second palette being released!!
I LITERALLY watch YouTube everyday 🤷🏽‍♀️
I love Shane. But his oh my gods are so annoying. That voice he does uhh
I still love watching youtube, I understand jeffree to a certain point. But shane i love a platform where i can watch what you choose to film. ❤
People complaining that the makeup palette is a cash grab. For eff sake they could release it in December and say it’s coincidental for people getting Christmas gift. If he released it in February you would say the same shii for Valentine’s Day. Y’all reaching for anything to blame. Lol It doesn’t even matter at this point, there will be haters. I support them plus Jeffrey star formula on his makeup is bomb af. Proud of all of them! 🤍
I knew there would be a point in time the channels and YouTubers I grew up watching would come to an end. I just didn’t want to believe it 😢
For me Jeff for us 😢
I just got done watching a Jesse and Jeanna video… haven’t been on yt since you were originally “cancelled”.. like y’all have uploaded again… and I’m literally confused where to comment and how to even view where things are… I’m relearning … I’m only 28!! 😂😂😂😂😂
I cant be the only one ready to cry! :(
YouTube is NOT dead.  Business as usual on YT, however, is over.  This platform needs to recognize that.  I'm here for this content, this FEEDS me, Shane.    I'm evolving. learning.  changing.  I want to see that reflected in anyone I follow.   Shane, Ryland, Morgan, Colleen, and now, my sweet Jeffree. We grow together, and your "showing the work" is motivating, encouraging,  and uplifting to watch.  Creators/YouTube:   We are here for THIS!  Do I watch TT when I'm bored, annoyed, need a quick distraction??? Absolutely.    But (especially after the Pandemic started), I went to YT for connection.  I am venturing out of my comfort zone, and I am emboldenedby Creators who recognize the need for self-growth, and have the courage to walk it out publicly.   If your goal is $ and views, then i hear you.  But if your goal is to make it is possible for one other person to feel equipped to KEEP TRYING,  then you are GOALS.  Please don't stop. You are necessary.
On YT for Shane and JS alone and Ryland ❤please keep the content going
These videos are my comfort videos
I’m sure someone out there is prepping a video to talk about the silencer…
The whole YouTube is dead & no one watches it anymore makes me sad how true thag is. I personally still love to chill & watch YouTube videos, but I understand these days with short content like tik tok & Instagram reels, peoples minds crave the quick there it is kinda content.  I’ll still keep watching but I understand 100% where Jeffree is coming from   Change is scary, but Shane don’t worry, think you’ll always have a place here because the longer content like this is what a lot of people still come to YouTube for ❤
I refuse to believe youtube is dead. I've been here since 2007. While I've noticed engagement is down by a fuckton...its cause all the other apps we got now to fuck around on. YouTube is still #1 for me. I respect J* decision. He's basically an internet dinosaur and if he wants to quit then he should. Many more accomplishments for him I'm sure
Omg 😆 LITERALLY Jeffery cracks me tf up 💀💀😂😂
I really hope Jeffree changes his mind and doesn't leave I know people say YouTube is dying and no one really watches it anymore pays attention but a lot of people do a lot of people still love Jeffree and Shane's videos even if they're the old ones but we just wait for them to make new ones I really hope Jeffree star doesn't leave YouTube
Great video!!!! I watch YouTube more now than I ever have but I guess now it’s for old fogeys like me considering that I’m in my late 40s😂❤
I’m not gonna lie, if this ends with the pallet coming out anyway, I will be buying it!
Ok but who tf posted that video of Shane on TikTok? 🤨 just asking for research purposes
I'm living for this new Jeffree ❤️❤️
Jeffree is too much I’m dyingggg😭😭
I watch YouTube!! I watch it everyday
I still love youtube content!!! Tik tok is not it for me
Like him or not Jeffree is extremely iconic (and funny)(and he looks good)
We care about YouTube ❤️
I think being number one in trending...number 4 right now...and sitting at over a million views proves people still watch YouTube.
I mean I still enjoy YouTube….. 😢❤these two!!!!!
i still watch it.......
im sad that hes leaving youtube but i get it  i still watch some things on youtube
I need the second pallete Shane and Jeffrey you still have so many people that do love you FUCK the HATERS!! you do all you do for those like me the SUPPORTERS AND FANS!! We love you don’t stop let’s get it!!❤ much love to you Jeffrey ryland Chris maddy the teams ect
I love YouTube:(
Only come to YT for Shane ❤
Not me from Casper WY looking at the people in the airport to see if I know anyone 😂
Hi love you and your new animal family
When @jeffree says nobody cares about videos anymore I literally felt so sad… I know I’m not the only one who watches @shane and his documentary over and over
Smartest thing for YouTube to do is give them a show together. I literally only watch YouTube for y’all!!
I love them
It's so great too see jeffrey looking happy 😀😍
Weird question but did uno die?
UM I WILL ALWAYS CLICK ON A SHANE DAWSOM VIDEO OG
I know that not a lot of people are on YouTube anymore, and it is your guys’ income. I just wanted to let you know that whenever Shane, Ryland, and Morgan post I get so excited. I wait until I’m home and winding down, and then I get all comfy and watch their videos. I understand the need to potentially step away if not enough people are tuning in, just wanted to let you know that as long as you are here you’ll have people like me that can’t wait to watch it.
Cant believe i actually started crying at the end 😢 😭 Sorry to see Jeffree quit youtube. Literally ONE OF THE OG's !!
the things i would give to be a fly on the window of jeffree's hummer with shane 😭
i’d love to be jeffrey’s friend and hang out at the house, get stoned, play some arcade games, walk or drive through the acres, pet some yaks, play w the pomeranians, idk, all of it😊
Why does Jeffrey look so good 😩
that wallpaper in the bath room is everything
I really thought the big news was going to be him and Nate getting back together or Jeffrey running for office and getting into politics 💀
CAREFUL MAN....HE GOT YOU TO TOUCH THE GUN......if theirs a murder and they find that gun they will see your finger prints on it
Wait, is that the Lord of the rings playing on Jeffrees living room TV? I love him even more 💕
I swear to god if Shane quits like Jeffrey and Jenna I will die I barely survived when he stoped posting these past 2 year 😭😭😭😭
I love YouTube it’s the main video service I use! I don’t think it’s dead!
I’m glad he’s found peace and enjoying his life, he’s worked so hard he deserves it
I am gutted Jeffree is leaving YouTube 😭
I agree with jeffree! I don’t watch YouTube nearly as much at I did years ago. It’s not my first choice anymore. Everything is clickbait, ads on ads, and just showing stuff off. It’s not my vibe anymore.   With that being said- I wasn’t sure how I was going to feel about this series and so far it’s been enjoyable and I’m excited to watch the rest of it. Great job!
Oh Shane I missed you and Jeffree together so glad he is happy
at 22:46 is the hammer back on that gun or am i just seeing things?
First off, from editing view, can I just say that I really loved the front of this video with the cutting in comparison of the previous series to the current time frame and with the music. :) good job
JEFFREE NOOOO
I watch YouTube everyday still. Just because it’s not trending or huge as it was doesn’t mean it’s going to go away. Maybe the makeup community will never be the same and thank God for that! 😅 too much access and waste.
Wait I love YouTube!! Why is no one watching YouTube
We still watch. 😢
it makes me sad knowing he’s gonna delete his YT cuz i always looked forward to anything he posted, it made me so happy no matter what 🥺💕🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Lol well than, IM FROM TEXAS JEFFREE!! 😒🙄😂
shut up shane
“Not a single person watches YouTube” all of us sitting here watching YouTube 👽 👽
Wishing ✌️ & ❤️ to all!
Jeff is a half way to republican and I'm here for it 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
bro if shane quits too i’m out
I love Jeffrey's new house and land, and how modest he has become. It's refreshing to see him not all about the materials. Love you all and so happy to see you filming together again!
whos going to tell jeffree that everyone is still on youtube, and the reason he's not getting clicks is not because youtube has "fizzled out"...?
I like traveling just not with like.. Elton John 🤣🤣🤣🤣
chris is such a good camera man
YouTube is my most used app 😅
We are watching!!!
We are watching and we absolutely love you and Jeffree and all the growth y'all have made! It's amazing to see! I will be sad if he quits but he has to do what his heart is telling him to do and Shane you better never quit! We'll still be here at 80 yrs old watching YouTube videos! 😁❤️😂😂❤️❤️ fr tho! 😁
Hearing Jeffree say he is quitting YouTube was very depressing. I genuinely pray that Shane never quits YouTube. I am still on here every day, watching my favorite game players or just vlogs. Shane videos are the highlight of my life, I drop everything just to watch them. While I think Jeffree needs to do what is inspiring to him, it doesn't sound like he likes TikTok either but does them for the views and to advertise. What happened to having fun, enjoying your work, and sharing that joy with others? That's what originally captivated me about Jeffree, and is still to this day why I admire and love Shane so much. He's genuine about his feelings, he doesn't sugar coat the struggles but he wants to share his passions with others. Shane, I hope you know there are a lot of us still out here who genuinely care very much about you as a human being, and love your content. We see your values and your intent, and we believe in you. We want you here with us on YouTube, and anywhere else you want to share with us. We want you to be happy and creative, and proud of your work, which you seem to be and that makes me happy for you.
I still watch stuff on YouTube like every day. Music in particular, but other stuff too. I'm going to miss JS's content a lot.. :(
I love Jeffree 😭 he seems so much more at peace. I’ll always be a supporter! His make up is unmatched and he will always be iconic!
So happy your back Shane, your videos bring me life on the worst days.
Awe I love YouTube still 🥺❤️
You and Jeffree need to do a ghost hunting series PLEASE 🙏
this was a 55 min video of regurgitated material with 6 ads in between. only information u need is that jeffrey quit youtube.
Love you Shane ❤❤❤❤
I am totally shocked, never thought I’d see the day. I care and love watching your vlogs. You are an entertainer and a great businessman, it’s lovely seeing what you’re doing💜
I understand, but I will still watch anything Shane or Jeffree put out 🥰🥰🖤
Please no jefree I lost Jenna marbles!! I can't lose you too!!!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS REUNION 😭🥰💕💕💕💕💕💕 I FREAKING LOVEEEE U GUYS🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻 im so happy omfgggg💕💕
I was wondering how Jackie got that bag
i know it doesn't seem like anyone cares, but there are people who love and adore all of you. jeffree, you have done so much for the youtube community and i can't believe it's coming to an end; you ran you're reign baby, we're so proud of you❤️  shane and ryland, we love you guys and are continually so proud of both of you. you have come so far, and i personally can't wait to watch your journey unfold! i can't wait for the baby and wedding, you guys deserve the utmost of happiness. i love you guys🫶🏼
I think the trouble with Youtube is their censorship, deep state connections, propaganda, shadowbanning, promotion of lamestream news, and it has pushed the content quality down in general and forced the best creators out to other platforms. Google is where creativity goes to die. That is why I left the left. You and Jeffrey have been pushed to the middle by the far left fascist corporatist mentality which authoritarians globally would love you to believe is "far right". In the land of the blind, the one eye'd man is king. You and Jeffrey are starting to see reality for what it really is now that you've stepped away from that liberal cesspool that is California. It's not a four letter word to feel some conservative leanings like gun ownership. My husband and I are a gay military family and honestly, there is a happy middle ground for Americans to coexist if we would stop allowing the billionaire class to divide and conquer us. Jeffrey and you are PROOF of this bridge.
Y’all talk so much shit about him but 1.2 million view Lmaoo wassssup
Thank you Shane for coming back and making videos. And if you or jeffree ever read this please. I go to YouTube and watch you guys. I watch you! Shane! Jeffree! Ryland! Morgan! You guys have made me happy! Youtube may not be the same as it was before the pandemic but that is okay! I have always clicked and supported your videos! Jeffrees stories with you shane has brought me to tears many times and it brought me sadness and joy at the same time ( idk if that is healthy Iol) I love you guys! I wish jeffree wouldn't quit youtube! I'm literally  crying right now because I have followed his journey through thick and thin. But I understand why we as human beings have to move on and go forward with life. We have to challenge ourselves to get uncomfortable  and leave things behind in order to move forward. I love you guys. Jeffree I love you!
We will miss you, Jeffree 😢
“He got gayer” 😂😂😂
I still watch YouTube 🥲
I just bought a YouTube pillow… YouTube isn’t dying wtf 😳
god I miss jenna
Why was there a shot of Athens Georgia around the 24:00 mark?
I’m loving this new series and I love seeing Jeffree so happy!
I'm sorry sorry sorry. There are infinite ways to say sorry. But hopefully Jeffrey mental,emotionally, spiritual happy.  Physically we can hide what we feel. But he happy😘
Jeffree is like a really cool uncle 😂
"Maddie's hair is red, and I'm now a farmer, but other than that... same hoes!" 😂😂😂 I'm DYING
I still go home and watch YouTube for fun 😅
I feel like the cancelation was what Shane and Jeffree needed to realize that the superficial isn’t always best. Jeffree kinda became one with the person he was running from which was the sad little boy he grew up as who had a bad start to life. He became an extremist bc he wanted the things he never had and I completely get it. I loved him then and I love him now. He’s an amazing person. Shane needed the readjustment to focus on what mattered, his relationship, his friends, his family. He was killing himself working so much and trying to churn out all these amazing videos which we’ve all watched and loved, but we never wanted them at the cost of his happiness and health. I’m glad to see their both doing so much better and that they’re way happier being who they are now. I look forward to the rest of this conversation. I am sad to see Jeffree leave this platform, but I will gladly continue to watch him on TikTok and elsewhere. My dream is to meet these two amazing men and just thank them for how much they’ve helped me grow as a person and how they showed me that no matter what knocks you down, you keep going. Loving yourself and having amazing memories is all that matters. Others opinions don’t have any effect on your life unless you let them. They’re amazing people and I can’t wait to continue to see what they do together
Jeffree Youtube loves you. Just gotta rebrand. please don't leave me!
I’ve watched you before you came out to the world and I will continue to watch you
I’m on YouTube constantly I’ve been on a countdown until I can watch this series part 2!!
Ugh im gonna miss her
What is happening?
Wow. I got a super slow notification! 🍅 Love love love everything about everything!!! 🍄🧅
I really wonder if Jeffree has heard of the artist Tyler Childers and has listened to his song Creeker... this video gives me those vibes. love you guys!
Go away
He's correct no one really watches you tube anymore.
Jeffree is lookin like trade with this slightly masculine vibe... flippin from handsome to beautiful is almost a skill lol
“Like avengers” “How did that movie end” “Idk but we can put in later”  These 2 have a dynamic that you can’t always find.  Opposites but they work so well together 😊
😎
That was really hard to hear Jeffree talk about YT like that cus I am STILL that person that comes home and turns on YouTube to catch up with my favs and that’s how I’ve always been for the past 15 years. I can’t picture a future where all my favorite creators, especially Shane, just give up and leave :( I’ve had so many laughs watching Jeffree too. This one hurt.
No. Jeffrey I luv you . If you give up makeupnreveals please keep making these types of series. I prefer seeing the real you and your life and your friendship with Shane. I've literally come back to YouTube just for this series . But luv you both
Love love love seeing Jeffree. The energy and joy this man brings is always another level!!   YouTube is not dead. Not in my opinion …don’t stop making videos Shane and Ryland cuz I watch yours every week and love them.
Homie is strapped! Good job.
responding to what jeffree said- i’m 20 years old. i’ve been watching your and shane both for YEARS now. i can literally be 40 years old still watching you guys! you guys feel like my bestfriends, i’ll never get tired of either of you:) gotten me through so much.
Oh no 😢 don’t quit on us we need you I can’t have another hole in my heart next to the hole Jenna left 😩
Watching Shane is really just watching Ryland tiptoe around the right fat jokes.
I watch it!!!!
Jeffery I'm still here Dx
No one enjoys youtube, yet here we are enjoying YouTube 😂
just hearing jeffree say he’s leaving YouTube makes my heart hurt. you’ve seen these two grow over the matter of years… I’m just left teary thinking about it. :,)
I watch YouTube every single day. I have to disagree with Jeffree. Shane & Ryland are creating such great content. If Jeffree wants to quit it, he definitely should but that is HIS perspective on YouTube.
Not going to lie the fact that the entire comment section is fawning over Shane has me a little suspicious. Also I enjoy YouTube, I just unsubscribed from Jeffree honestly
Jeffrey talking about how he does everything all out is sooo Scorpio of him. We are OBSESSIVE once we love something we LOVE IT
Shanes tiny hands
This is fabulous ❤
I’m crying, I’m so sad Jeffree won’t be posting videos soon anymore
Wait ummm I still watch YouTube for enjoyment and the point of staying on YouTube is for your fans we love watching you
Lol jeffie  saying youtube sucks when they were filming with Shane
omg i love seeing u  together,  i didnt expect that jefrees coming again in the lights, but im glad because he never stop fighting for his dreams or goals and thats quite inspirational. Besides Shanes ure so funny i cant stop laughing. 💖💖
True there is better media . People want to game, or be on Instagram & Tiktok
I get what Jeffree is saying tho about “Youtube being dead”. I think podcasts and gaming is really taking over YouTube instead of other content creation. Youtube is still something I go on daily and prefer to watch then any other platform because I like the more authentic videos instead of watching a show/ movie at times. Excited for pt 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If the new pallet is not announced or launched by the end of this series I’m gonna be hella sad 😭
Was that a silencer on the gun? Why would someone need that? 😳
This has been such a good series so far! And just so ya know there are still so many people that enjoy watching YouTube.  How else would we get to enjoy this amazing content?!
JEFFREE JUST BURTS OUT QUITTING YOUTUBE, NO FUCKS XD
Hmm does Shane live in Colorado? That’s DIA
Its so sad what this new generation has done to youtube and youtubers. they've basically killed it and made some of our favorites like jeffree and shane feel like they cant do it anymore because they don't get as many views and get hate from drama channels and comments from people that havent seen all their content. For those of us that grew up watching youtube and are older are still watching and still have love for these youtubers. I hope they dont quit for us that are left watching and actually support them.
Seeing you both together again just makes me so happy! ❤
Growing up with Shane, it’s probably time to hang this gig up and move on to something else. Same formula, boring.
Jeffrey explains for 5 straight minutes why he moved to wyoming....Shane then immediately asks "what made u move to Wyoming?" 🤪  Interview skills on point.
This series makes me so happy. I love seeing them together again and they just look so happy and healthy. Sad we will be seeing less Jeffree but love that he is fulfilled in his life and heart. Love you both💕
Morphed kicked me out of their stores, Wyoming welcomed me with open arms...best line ever
i’m so sad about jeffery leaving youtube </3 but i totally understand his reasonings and respect it. he has definitely grown into such a new human❤️we love you jeffery! we love you too shane!!!! xoxo
I love yall!! I love everything you do shane!! And Jeffrey as well!! Keep going you to!! Chris and Ryland as well!! All of yall great!!
I just had a little look at jeffrees channel and he's still getting over a million views each video so I don't get it, quit YouTube if you want, of course, but you can't say that no one cares or watches YouTube when you get over a million views on your videos.
😢Jeffree leaving YouTube? Nooooo😢 this is so freakin sad 😞
the guns 💀💀💀 why am i not surprised
Everyone is switching up creators. It's not dead ppl are bored with makeup. I keep YT going pretty much all day but now I watch educational videos and commentary channels. Young people that are just discovering makeup prefer fast Tiktoks.
Hide your cats
I LOVE WATCHING YOUTUBE. DONT LEAVE US HANGING ☹️
Wow Hummer really got Light Speed mode lol
after watching this i have a whole new respect for jeffery:)
So happy for Jeffree but going to miss him. I do get on YouTube to watch videos when I get home. So happy that his mental health has improved. So so important❤️❤️
No one cares anymore. Does that include the 1.1 million people who watched this？
Shane and Jeffree doing a paranormal investigation would be sooooo cool! yes!
all i am saying is youtube is my whole life so it better not end
I know you might not see this comment, but to Shane and Jeffree I just wanted to let you know I love your videos and always watch them for enjoyment. They bring a lot of laughter and happiness in my life especially on hard days. Life is so crazy I like to watch what goes on in your lives. Your lives are so interesting and different every day. I understand why Jeffree is quitting Youtube. I will miss his videos very much. Just know I am still loving every video you guys both post and am a huge fan. Wishing you all the best and most success. ❤ P.S. Merry Christmas! 🎄  Sincerely,  Corinne
This was truly enjoyable and entertaining. I'm so, so happy to see you all together again... THE OG'S!!! It warms my heart and it's very sad to hear Jeffrey say he's leaving😔 He can go to Rumble, say and do WHATEVER he wants! Could be something exciting. I don't know...🎶"it's so hard, to say goodbye, to yesterday"🎶 "Times, they are changing"
I’m so happy that Jeffree is happy now and he is doing whatever he has to do to keep himself happy 😊
He’s like “NOBODY WATCHES YOUTUBE” meanwhile it’s all I watch haha I don’t watch all the tv apps and stuff. Hopefully this isn’t a foreshadow of Shane quitting
Sadly what Jeffery said at the end is 100% true.
I love jeffree's hair boy short!
I hope that every hater, every sad loser that’s talked bad to either Shane or Jeffree on Twitter, every news media clickbait poster, anyone who has try to ruin Shane and/Jeffree based on old news or exaggerations and lies, sees this video and that they are both happy and thriving.
but WHERE does he sell the purses at? ebay? the real real?!
Jeffree to fly : “You son of a bitch - ZAP” 😂😂😂💕💕
😢😢😢
Jeffrey is right!! No one goes to youtube anymore? I know i have only come to youtube to watch this in the last two years
To be completely honest from watching Shane since about 2007 and growing up listening to jeffrees music from MySpace …I adore the friendship and the humbleness
I love how genuinely happy and at peace Jeffree seems! I still watch YouTube daily, I hope you continue to make amazing content Shane, it truly is the bit of light in the darkness I’m in.  It’s really sad to see Jeffree go, but I’ll support him regardless 🖤
God jeffree is literally glowing. ❤
Nobody watches YouTube anymore with 1.1 million views in one day about him
...If it's animals it's ranching not farming. And this is a hobby ranch.
Hearing Jeffree say he’s leaving YouTube is sad to think about. I get that not that many ppl watch youtube anymore but to see him leave isn’t going to be the same anymore.
Shane Do not quit YouTube!! I repeat
I am glad this series is back,  butttt I am going to have to have say if jefferee can reflect back on his singing career that would be cool, it is where I found out who jefferree star was and inspired me and helped in my younger years- plano center was EPIC
why is no one talking about the gun. ??
Plenty still watch youtube. I don't have tiktok and don't personally want to, but I may have to 🤷‍♀️
ME I STILL WATCH YOUTUBE
I love love love your content Shane , I’m excited for your projects , I’m sad jefree is leaving YouTube I love him as well 😢
Even though I am 1 person, I really do enjoy watching Shane and Ryland’s YouTube videos. If your passion is still there why not continue to make videos? I’ll still watch!!
I loved this. Jeffree has such a mix of feminine and masculine. Jeffree is so gorgeous manly with no makeup and the dark eyes
I love YouTube! Oh no...I am an old lady huh?!
Why did I cry when Jeffree walked through the door at the airport 😅🖤
I love that you are doing another series I absolutely look forward
I don’t have cable in my room.. all I watch is YouTube 😅 I’m sorry Jeffree 🥺
So sad people video shane in public like  yo say hi to him
WHOAH I am so DOWN with a Shane and Jeffree haunted series
JEFFREE has 600,000 views on his last video and is QUITTING YOUTUBE.
Jeffree: YouTube is dead no one cares!. Shane: 👁👄👁
As a full blown red blooded conservative I want to buy up all of JSs products! ❤️👏I will totally support him and I don’t even wear that much makeup lol
I click on all your videos Shane ❤️
Oh no Jeffree don't quit
Oh..sad to hear u tube does not have a space for Jeffrey. He looks sooooo healthy and happy . He had a lightness. Love his lil piece of happy with his yaks and pups and acres of freshness ! Its great seeing you all together.
Shane : I have been holding this BODY on my shoulders and im tired. Lmfaooo I felt that. 🤣
Jeffree looks amazingly healthy and extremely happy.  Proud of him so much!!!!
Stop it, when he said he was done I literally cried I love Jeffree so much, and you too Shane, y’all are literally my preteen up until now…hood 😢❤️ But I want him and you Shane to do what make’s each of y’all happy!!! Much love 💕
Shane tell Jeffree he can't leave us. So many people watch YouTube still. You, your podcast, Jeffree, ryland and his podcast and sister Morgan are all I ever watch. TV sucks. You all are the only thing I look forward to at the end of the day. Pop YouTube on and scroll till I find something from one of you guys to watch. I hope he changes his mind 😭
I may need some Buffy for my husband.
Boring
WE MISSED JEFFRY AND SHANE
I would rather watch YouTube than tick tock
Ngl, this was pretty dope.
It might be because I’m 29 but I watch everything on YouTube everyday. Idk what id do without YouTube 😭😭
awww jeffree your evolving yessss my favorite thing to say now days is im over it
Part three- Shane convinced Jeffery YouTube doesn’t suck and he doesn’t quit…. Right?! 😭❤️
I love the relaxed vibe of this video. You can really see the growth and quiet realisation of true importance of life that has happened since the last series but still maintaining their individual personalities. Many people strive for the professional and financial success they have achieved but don't understand the personal sacrifices or mental struggles they encountered to get there. I'm not sure it's worth it but they may say otherwise
Great now i want an electric hummer...
I can't believe yall are really supporting these two...omg
cant wait for the next episode omg!!! ily guys & missed yall
I should just skip to the last five minutes of all these parts, that’s where the new stuff is. The first fifty minutes are fun but filler
quickest 55 minutes ever :(
nah because i’m watching i’ve been waiting for shane to come back so i really hope he does
Idc if YouTube is going downhill, I will keep watching Shane’s videos until the earth gets absorbed into the sun
I’m sad to hear Jeffree is hanging up his heels from youtube. I guess I’m the only grandma still watching youtube😆🤷🏼‍♀️I watch all the videos! But i understand it not for him anymore.
Jeffree: Youtube sucks.. No one is clicking anymore... Youtube is dead. Shane: Gets over a million views in less than 24 hours...  I'm literally on Youtube everyday all day! It is NOT dying!
Oh god I feel so sad after watching this video. I think it's because I'm feeling the same way that Shane does. I mean I'm quite literally on my computer watching youtube, this is all I watch except for when I go to bed and turn on Bob's Burgers on Hulu for background noise. I don't feel like Youtube is dying out. But I do believe that Youtube has messed with its algorithms too much so thats why they're less views. Idk, it just sucks hearing Jeffree leaving Youtube.
It's so nice to see and hear the real Jeffree Star..not the fake High pitched Jeffree. I'm sooo here for it!
Pls do some actual interesting content 😅bored of Jeffree tbh
I just happy that they are happier now
Maybe its good hes leaving YouTube. Gives the younger generations to come a chance to shine!
Shane don’t you dare stop making videos
shane you and jeffree need to do a ghost haunting series! LOL
Totally called it the last like 10 videos you can just tell Jeffree isn’t in it anymore. Also he’s wrong though ALOT of people still watch YouTube they just watching gaming videos and true crime not makeup
it’s so sad to see youtube go down a hard slope because i still watch everyday but i know more and more people aren’t. i feel like i’m the only person out of my friends that watches everyone else is on tiktok or a podcast. i still watch podcasts but they’re just youtubers idk i definitely miss the old days when it was 30 million plus views a video because it felt like a real community of people
Okay if Shane were to bring on Jenna Marbles in this series for a small interview on YouTube and cancellation, I would DIE.
I legit ONLY watch YouTube DAILY.. I might watch some old shows on Netflix every once in a while, but the majority of my “sit down and watch something” time is spent watching YouTube videos.. I very rarely watch anything on tiktok tbh..  Edit: Just so all of you fake “you’ve won a prize! Send me a DM!” folks know, I report every single one of y’all.. I will NEVER fall for that BS! Just STOP! 🤬🖕🏻😤
99% of people don't subscribe to cancel culture. Its an over reported opinion of the minority. I think most people these days can understand that the small snippet they see of a person on YouTube is not the total person in real life. Every single person alive makes mistakes and I actually feel more connected to a flawed person over someone that pretends they are perfect
i still love clicking on youtube and watching Shane and Rylan, a lot of tiktokers are now starting youtube because its a great platform
That song at 10:42 really sounds like Shane at first to me 😅
Jeffee saying no one watches youtube and has millions and views and over 600k views on most videos!! My boyfriend and I watch YouTube daily for hours 😂 okaaay
As with any Shane and Jeffree video collab, I never want it to end bc they’re soooo good. There is so much truth and realness to this series which makes you open your eyes to how YouTube is slowly fizzing out and Jeffree realizes that. He’s humbled himself in the beautiful state of Wyoming and is living his best Yak life exactly the way he should be. ❤ I look forward to part 2 & 3! 😊
No one's clicking anymore yet this video got a million views okay Jeffrey 😆
I disagree with Jeffree, I care about youtube. I've been waiting for him to upload some videos for a hit minute. Which he has sporadically. But Tik tok is shit, it's sound bites. It's literally a fraction of the time and effort you put in as opposed to youtube where you can show the process.
I wuld run to YouTube if they made a full paranormal searis
Number two trending… YouTube sucks… YouTube still recommends the video .. he’s not lying I literally only come on here for Shane Dawson
No I'm literally manifesting a ghost hunting in Wyoming with Jeffree and Shane 😫
I will literally physically come for anyone who decides that they want to start shit again and cancel people. Like get a life. If your early adulthood was on camera, what would we find? Would you be canceled? I bet you would. STFU and let people live!
Wait. 😂 why are there no dinosaur ghosts 😂
I need a series of Shane and Jeffree ghost hunting for Casper the ghost in Casper Wyoming 🤣👻
You can’t do this to me… I have to wait for pt 3 😫 I swear these series are so amazing! Your wrong Jeffree I still click on your channel because I believe in supporting decent, honest, ppl like you and Shane.
Youtube isn't dying but the content people want to watch is changing. I love Youtube more than any other social media platform as it provides the background noise in my life as I don't watch TV. There are still plenty of makeup channels I watch but none of them have millions of subscribers or sensational personal lives. I purely watch for content quality rather than personalities. I've also started watching a lot of podcasts and artist videos. I think after covid we are all a bit more grounded in real life
Wow.. it’s the end of an era
omg Jeffree dont stop filming. you are a huge inspiration to me. omg. i will cry if he stops filming.
DUDE NOOOOOO!!!!! I DONT WANNA WATCH JEFREE ON TIK TOK JEFREE NEEDS TO STAY ON YT
I love you Jeffree 💖💯
If y’all don’t release that pallet imma be pissed lmfao
Me watching YouTube for entertainment daily ☠️
✨I feel like I’m back in 2019 when life was simpler✨ thank you Shane and Jeffree ♥️
Anyone else notice the photo of athens GA when Jeffrey’s talking about his small town in Wyoming lmao
The best part of these videos is how much you guys have grown and realizing that happiness is worth more than (I hate this word), clout or whatever your younger selves were looking for. You all have gone out, in search of your happiness and you knew it wasn't where you were at. It's actually very inspiring and I appreciate the growth. And you finding the importance to share it. Because it is significant
I’m so happy for Jeffree but so sad. Shane is gonna need to keep making these documentaries so we can keep watching these guys. I really missed these.
Just because Jeffree star doesnt get views it doesnt mean youtube is dying! Look at ishowspeed he is carrying 2022 youtube now
I am so sad that Jeffrey is quitting YouTube and the fact he/she thinks no one cares about his videos makes me rilly sad because I love his videos and he/she  really inspired me to do makeup. 🥺
i love youtube still! i still use all the streaming platforms but everynight i come on youtube to see my favorite people to watch!!
shane! i love the new outfits
Wowww. Firstly, I cried tears of joy seeing the iconic duo come back together. The emotions that come back to me was crazy. Secondly, I didn't stop laughing. The way these two bounce off each other is amazing. I haven't seen these sort of humour since before cancellation and honestly it left a massive empty spot in my life. It just hasn't been the same since. Thirdly, for that reason one of the biggest stars on YouTube cannot stop, Jeffree makes YouTube. It wouldn't be the same without him. It's sad that he sees YouTube as something that has died. Hopefully with this series Shane can bring it back! Kudos to you Shane, so far you've absolutely smashed it. You may not be everyone's cup of tea but you're my cup of tea with two sugars in it. Much love to you all ≤3
I bought cremated 🎉
I absolutely love this Jeffrey! He seems so much happier and looks amazing.
We need a Shane X Jeffree ghost hunting videos like sam & colby but you two PLEASE😻
I total feel the YouTube. I still watch trying to get the nostalgia I had in the past and it’s just impossible now 😢 we’re getting old..
I don’t think ill ever not come on YouTube. I come home from work and it’s all I look forward to. Such a shame to see all my favorite people walk away from it but I do understand it. Sad how things will never be like how they use to.
Please don’t pull a Jenna Marbles.
Jeffrey was right about the paranormal activity in wyoming, I lived there for 4 years and experienced some of the scariest moments of my life there
Jeffree seems so happy!! I'm so happy for you both. "SOOoooOOO?1?!" Iconic!!
The way I cried so hard at the end of this video :( love all of you so much
It's good to see you guys again! 😘
17:03 I'm fkn dead 😂
😮no way!!!!😢😢😢 I still look forward to watching Jeffrey on YouTube
“As long as you don’t use they and them, you’ll be fine” 😂
Oh it kinda makes me sad to hear Jeffree may quit YT. 😢 That was such an honest and genuine conversation when he said no one cares anymore. 🥺
Wow well part 2 didn’t disappoint. So good! When you and Jeffrey a few together it’s magic. The first part I was so confused it was hard to understand what was going on with the jumping back and forth but now understanding what’s happening thisepisode was so good can’t wait for the last
I still watch youtube. It's in my daily routine to check for new uploads
Am i the only one or do jeffree's new life has a sense of emptiness and loneliness? I know he looks like he's feeling better but i feel like it's almost like a mask to cover up a lot of scars   Idk how to explain it but I used to cover up things and act like I'm doing well but deep inside i felt nothing   I know I'm  looking too much into it but i do hope he's genuinely happy
The ending of the video frustrates me “nobody watches anymore, nobody cares. “thats not true!” it’s very true!!” Jeffree has always been famous in many different stages of his life for a long time and peaked an ultimate fame around 2020-21. I’m sorry Jeffree that you have decreased in views and think a few million is nothing anymore and you think hundreds of thousands of $ is nothing compared to what you have gotten to roll in faster. Good to know ig bye jeffree
Just watched for a second time!  Loved it again! ❤❤❤
But we’re happy to watch you guys again 💛 100% yes we do watch YouTube still, with all luv
Who made that tiktok of shane?!? Like what! Made me so upset
I’m so proud of Jeffrey and how much he’s accomplished. I hope he doesn’t disappear completely but I’m happy to know he’s happy and doing well, I’d love to travel one day and definitely visit his restaurants or possibly even see them in Australia one day! I love you Jeffrey! Keep being you and do what’s best for you, you’ll always be loved by so many. ❤
i understand why Jeffree would want to be done with youtube. but his statements just aren’t true— me, and almost everyone i know gets home from work or being out and sits down to watch youtube!
Shane not going to lie if I see you in person I'm giving you a hug!
i still don’t think wyoming is real
Ever since Jeffrey Star drama I cannot come two terms to support him because he's just a all around horrible person who treats his fans like crap. I don't know how anybody could support  somebody like him. It seems like a lot of people just forgot what happened, I used to like Jeffree Star a lot now I cannot even stand to watch him anymore. I do like Shane though, I know he's been through some tough s*** too, but it's very minor compared to Jeffree Star.
Ghost hunting with Jeffree star HELL YES
Shane, don't be getting any ideas from Jeffree quitting youtube
53:25 sorry Jeffrey it's just you😂
I still watch, I still love YouTube 🥺
I’m just wondering where Jeffree got his bathroom wallpaper!
Crying with your millions  O God
"No one watches it anymore"... this video with 1.1 million views in a day and top trending
Can Jeffrey just move to Colorado? I want to see more of their iconic duo
Love you Jeffree... You're so humble. Completely new person.. So awesome. Love how blunt you are. We would so be friends..
I dont want Jeffree to go but I understand if he feels he should.
I still watch YouTube!
I still watch YouTube daily tbh
Ok but I still need jeffrees life journey updates from somewhere! I'm so proud of him and glad to see Shane back at it. 🖤
Some things I can cope with but it’s bad enough that jeffree has said he’s stopping YouTube BUT if shane follows in these “quitting YouTube” antics I will cry fr I will sob because I need this elite duo to continue 😢
None of these people live in any sort of reality.
Jeffree looks so content and so good and healthy.  I'm sad to hear he's going to leave youtube, but time marches on.  Don't you go anywhere Shane.  You just got back.   Looking forward to seeing some beautiful yak footage in the next.
He's gets millions of views but YouTube is "dead" lol riiight
I genuinely LOVE how inclusive Jeffery was of Chris 🙏🏻 That was really beautiful and you can see how happy he is and at peace with himself and his past! I love that this series has come out!
sooooooooo WHEN are we getting a Shane and Jeffree ghost hunting series... like actually im BEGGING
I literally watch YouTube 24/7
These comments are more filtered than an insta model
So happy your back, you’re always there to distract me when something bad happens. It’s fate 😂
Why when I started this video did I think “damn I would hate to come on here one day and see Jeffree disappear….” His videos make me so happy like wow. 😢I’m so so so sad.
YouTube is where I come when I need a break from real life. I hate TikTok. Short term content doesn’t do it for me !!  ❤
As this video has 1.1 million views. We are watching!
What is the song at 14:12?
Jeffree with natural brows is fucking hot 🔥
I watch YouTube every single day while doing my dishes, cooking, and cleaning. I would be lost without it. Sad that Jeffree thinks it’s dead. But I definitely see a difference in the beauty industry.
SHANE'S SKIN Y'ALL HOLY FUCK I'M SHOOK!!!! the sunlight really hittin different from the studio lights, you can most definitely tell Shane feels better, and takes better care of himself physically and mentally! really proud of your growth Shaney, been here since 2014, ain't leaving now no matter what.<3
Wow amazing..... freaking love jeffree star!
Okay, then it's time to hit up Netflix, or Hulu and start a series. A Haunted Wyoming, with Shane and Jeffree!
I love you two working together and im so excited to see what you guys do next 💗
I love you guys. ❤
Jeffree trying to turn the narrative around and pretend like YouTube - a platform that still works for many creators - is dead, instead of the reality that he was chased out of it because he became irrelevant, both in content and personality, to his former fans due to too many controversies, too much showing off and not a lot of respect for those of us who watched.
i still watch youtube everyday please dont quit youtube jeffree star 💔
Can we talk about how he went from zero sponsorships to now 2? I see you Shane and I love you ❤❤
I fully disagree with Jeffree. I love YouTube. Every single night I’m in bed, I watch YouTube for hours.
Cried so much watching this. Jefree is such an inspiration.
This shows that people can change. You and jefree has changed so much for the better. I’ll always support and love you guys.
This is so sad! I love Jeffree and it's sad to know he will not longer make videos but it's great to know that he is happy and having the mental peace that's what it matters
Aww Jeffree I still watch your YouTube videos all the way from little old NZ 😭💜🇳🇿🌈
Anyone else uncomfortable with the cheating jokes?? I know we only get a glimpse of Shane and Ryland but Shane constantly flirting with Chris and then making weird jokes about Chris and Jeffree on camera just rub me the wrong way. I had to stop watching the podcast because it was just too much. I hope for the best with Shane and Ryland's relationship but those jokes can really cut deep and to have the mindset to even make them? It makes you wonder what happens off camera
Idk why but I’m watching this and having crazy déjà vu… anyone else? Idk I feel like I’ve seen this before. Mandela effect ?
Is true. Network are taking over YouTube. I rarely watch any other YouTuber.
Oh my god !!!!! Thank you Shane for This documentary. We really needed this.
Please, if any of you are going to stop doing YouTube, then I'm begging y'all to at least do a Wyoming Paranormal Activities Series! 🖤👻🖤🤍
I am SO Sad 😞 I will click Everytime either you or Jeffree post.... I wish I could be 30 million 😪
I'm sooooooo saaaaaaaaaaad now... I'm literally crying...........
I can't believe it!... Its like literally the end of the era and I"ve just realised it... "YouTube is dead" hit me to death.... That is sooooo not true. At list to me...
I love you Shane and Jeffree! Never stopped!
❤️❤️❤️
Gun control is such a funny joke im laughing so hard guys
I hope shane does YouTube until he’s an old man with grandkids
19:55 is so funny to me🤣
Jeffrees voice even sounds different! He’s just so relaxed it’s crazy. So happy he and Maddie are reunited 💕
How is Jeffree gonna get UberEats/Grubhub out there? :D lol
ICONIC. Can’t wait for part 3 ❤
Shane if you quit YouTube I stg
I’m so obsessed with new Jeffree ❤
I still care about YouTube 😭
I CAN BARELY HEAR WHAT THEYRE SAYING THE MUSIC'S TOO LOUD 😭
I missed them SO MUCH. So glad they are doing another series. They both seem to be in better places and much happier!!
The comment positivity… it makes me so happy. I’m scared to lose them both, too. I truly hope they don’t leave. TikTok isn’t the same as YouTube. It’s just short blurbs that are like vine, to me. There’s so much good content on here that’s just not being seen due to algorithms.
Hi how are ya to all the people who are still here watching and still watch YouTube
I can’t believe Jeffree  is leaving YouTube- I’m gutted. I’m gonna miss the light he brings to YouTube
Wow. Jeffery whether your dressed as a guy or girl. I don't care.You are a beautiful  person. Inside out. I would for sure fall in love with you. Your so gorgeous  and what a beautiful  soul.
He says that as he has 1.3 million views on videos
I dont watch tv i watch YouTube only. What are you talking about JS!!! Lol
Uncancelling..
so sad jeffree is leaving youtube. shane you better never do that to us
Fill me in... Jeffree was cancelled? For what?  Im confused
Hearing YouTube is dying hurst my heart as it’s all I spend my time on, but when I told a 13 year old I watch YouTube that looked at me like I’m crazy.
No Jeffree don’t leave YouTube 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This fills my heart im so happy they are moving on to better things YouTube isn’t everything we will miss you but the true fans will understand
I love you both so much ❤
Shane, if you read this!  Can you please tell Jeffree that he will be missed and he will forever be my favorite YouTuber!  ❤ Star World
I'm not leaving You or Ryland
Lol i love shane and ryland they’re the perfect ying and yang they constantly have me laughing at every joke😂😂 ❤❤ i love uuu shane ur my queen/king
Wasn’t this titled the retirement of jeffree star?
Ok but him with eyebrows looks good
loved this thanks
I only see this because of Jeffrey (not that he is a saint but at least he is funny)... So I can't believe Shane still does youtube after all his hardcore bs being displayed and the fact he isn't funny anymore
Love that jeffree has completely became a different person . He’s living his best life and he’s right he has done it all .. he is og and I still watch YouTube like everyday ! He will be missed on YouTube but I guess onto better things . 😢
I’m sorry but Jeffree is literally so hot. Something ab him holding the guns too like OML
I love YouTube actually and I do sit down and watch it for enjoyment
I still care about youtube 🥺
I love Jeffree so dang much!!!!!!!
I loved this video, I love you two together. I'm so happy for Jeffree for feeling better and feeling at peace. I hope.he doesn't quit YouTube though,  even if he gets half a million views only but if he uploads once every3 months is still something, I wqtch YouTube all day, hate tiktok. And also I love that he is a farmer, that's what we need ❤️ healthy animals= healthy food. I so want to try yak meat.
Jeffree you are glowing happy & at peace, it shows ✨️💖
He's right about youtube but it breaks my heart!!! Nobody watches cause yall quit doing these kind of videos....EVERYONE loves this shit!!!!! I freaking love yall!!!!
I seriously care about YouTube still, I have done since I was 13 years old and I’m Now 30, and I still watch it every single night . It means so much too me , I genuinely love it so much and seeing you all grow has been amazing 🌸 so Thanku for showing your life to us , it’s been an amazing and also hard journey for you . And just know I appreciate it all . I know I’m literally no one but just know I’ve loved every single episode from you Shane and Jeffree xx
Scary videos please!!!!!!
I'm gonna miss him
The pinky- I can’t 😂💀⚰️
The pics at 23:48 are not even of casper 😂 still love you though! ♥️
"No one goes to youtube" as we are all on youtube right now!
Low key Jeffree looks so amazing and cute I love it!
Oh my God this made me love Jeffrey even fucking more , when you pulled out that gun with a silencer hahhaha I fucking LOOOOVE YOU! I live in the boonies too & mam it changes you lol I wanna be where no one is too 👌🙌
Jeffree NOOO! The older people who have been with you this whole time are here... I'm literally crying... 😭
this content is fueling my soul so much i love watching you two together 😭
I’m truly so sad that Jeffrey is leaving YouTube. So many people still watch his videos. It will be hard to see him go but if that’s what is best for him then I understand. But I will say Shane is NOT allowed to follow. YouTube truly would be over if we lost Shane.
I truly love Jeffree, always have.. but each time you’ve made a series about him I just love him more!
Thank you so much for doing this serie! I think it was important to put a final end to all this « drama » and tornado that happened to both of you. I’m glad to see that you found happiness somewhere else than in the viewers eyes and love, you deserve happiness and peace of mind after all this. Can’t wait to see more! ❤️
I still watch YouTube daily. I hope my favorites never quit!
"Not one single person goes to youtube for enjoyment anymore. "  A million views later and number 1 on trending
Please never leave YouTube Shane. 😫 I watch YouTube all day every day lol. I will always be here to support you ❤️
Some of us definitely still watch YouTube but IMO the content on here is dead
I love Jeffree, Shane and Ryland.. This video left me feeling sad at the idea of Jeffree no longer being on YouTube. If that's what's best for you Jeffree, I support your decision. I will be sad and will have to watch the old videos to get my fix 🥴😅
I prefer YouTube over any other app, I watch it daily and I hate shorts I want real content.
I still love these two so much and to hear Jeffree is quitting upsets me but i understand some what why he feels this way
This is to show that Jeffrey cares a lot about producing “vegan” makeup…
Dream has a second channel?!
I’m still here on YouTube HELLO   😂
Awe... the end of this video Shane's documentaries are absolutely perfection & his face when Jeffree dropped the bomb was alot of us! I'm so glad Shane's back but man I'm going to miss Jeffree! But so glad he's happy! Hang up his button 😪
“No one watches YouTube anymore” meanwhile I’m still just as addicted to it lol
Imagine Jeffree Star and Ghost Adventures doing a lockdown lol I’d be down for that
“America”! Lmao I love Jeffree. The they/them comment was gold. He gets it.
I care Jeffery 😢
Shane if you and jeffeee keep making series I will ALWAYs watch 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
i dont want jeffree to stop, but i want him to do what he enjoys. I wish him the best
You tube beauty is dead but I loooove my blue cactus dairy goat channel
Yall are FREAKING AMAZING and always makes my day, this video was amazing as always !!!!!!!
Seeing that gun and how casual Jeffery was with it made me feel super uncomfortable tbh. I know it's for protection but I just think it's really sad that people feel the need to have one on them at all times. I live in Canada and gun violence is so rare here, but it's not uncommon to hear about tragic shootings in America. Also I respect Jeffery in his decision to quit YouTube but to say nobody watches his content anymore so what's the point... there's definitely still people who do watch his videos and have stuck by him through it all; so to say "nobody watches, what's the point" is kinda redundant. Just because he has lost a lot of his audience these past few years does not mean that YouTube is dead. I see many content creators old and new still thriving on here, infact many TikTokers have even created their own Youtube channels so they have another platform to share their content. I'm hoping Shane doesn't join Jeff on this "f*ck YouTube" mentality because I know so many people, myself included, who still come home after work and watch YouTube videos. I'm sorry YouTube isn't what it used to be for him, just like LA & designer purses isn't what it used to be for him..but that doesn't mean YouTube itself is dying. I'm genuinely happy for Jeffery living his best Yak Ranch life, but this video left me feeling not great. The editing was great tho, good job Shane!
I’m officially depressed…🥺
I watch utube all the time.  I prefer peoples videos over the polished stuff on the streaming platforms.  I watch this WAY more!  I subscribe to several of the streaming services but I alway check in here first to see if there is anything that interests me. And I hate all the nuts jobs on Tic Tok.
In regards to Jeffree saying no one watches his videos for fun anymore, I still do. I love him and I’ll always support his channel and whatever venture he chooses to go on. Love you all so much!! Thanks for this series ❤️
Love the vid! Just wanna say launching electric vehicles is so much fun! Also I really hope Jeffree doesn't quit YouTube 😭 I love watching his videos
beautiful video ♥️
Woaw that end was kind of shocking yeah. But I also totally understand his point. It's true we no longer consume like before
You and Jeffree are amazing together and bring comfort to one anothers souls like no other. What a kindred connection
This video felt like coming home. And seeing Jeffree now made me so happy for him <3 He is where he is supposed to be. And I don't think YouTube is dead, since I'm here every day. And TikTok ant exchange it at any point. So :)
Not the giant silencer on the end 💀 Gagged
Aww i miss Jenna. YouTube isn’t dead to me though, I still use it everyday lol!
Jeffree & Shane are the most humbled YouTubers I envy there friendship its so genuine and real. I Love them together. ❤️ I'm so sad that Jeffree is leaving YouTube.
Jeffree flooring his electric hummer with glee when he’s driven literally some of the fastest cars in the world was just so therapeutic to me
Jeffree look so beautiful with eyebrows
I wish Jeffree would of said “I went from giving hummers to owning a Hummer!”
To see Jeffree and Shane change to be the people that they are today makes me so proud of their healthy changes I’m glad I didn’t go away from you guys when you guys canceled because I always believed you guys.
It’s really unfair for him to sit there and say “ YouTube is dead “ only because Jeffrey’s Channel is dead, I mean how many makeup pallets can you make before it’s just too much? I think it’s also inappropriate to sit there and say “ nobody watches YouTube “ when Ryland literally makes weekly vlogs about his life etc. I feel like Jeffree should just speak the truth and say that his Channel is dead and nobody is really interested in him anymore. There’s still so many YouTubers that want to make more money and grow on YouTube, I think it’s really rude and cocky to say “ YouTube is dead “ only because he made all of his money already. I think saying what he said in a room with Ryland and Shane ( who are amazing at YouTube ) is just not on. He could of easily just said he doesn’t want to do it anymore and that’s that. Because he just needs to take a seat and release that there is still so many more YouTubers more and less successful than him that will be on YouTube for years. And he needs to humble himself down and release that his makeup line and YouTube channel is not interesting anymore whatsoever.
Jeffrey: nobody watches YouTube anymore  Everyone watching this on YouTube: 👀 👄 👀
Shane always picks the best music for his videos
I really hope he doesn’t quit YouTube I get so excited when he posts a reveal I wish he posted more content.
I'll never stop watching YouTube
Seriously if we don't get a Shane and Jeffree ghost hunt!
I basically only watch YouTube on my Tv… but I guess there’s been a switch in what people nowadays watch. I’m kind of a new YouTube-watcher (maybe started really finding channels 3-4 years ago.
You know, YouTube isn’t dead a new generation stepped up. Vlogginv and crazy videos isn’t  what they want anymore they want something new and existing. I’m the generation of YouTube and therefore It can never be boring to me. YouTube  was the invention of the 00s.   It will always be my GO2, yep we’re getting older 😂.
will forever be my comfort people
Nooooo Jeffery don’t leave YouTube… I still run to YouTube … this sucks if u stop YouTube.. messed up my night.
This made me so happy. I love how calm and happy everyone seems.
Shane you are right. Everything is planned out. It’s just not our plan it’s Gods.
'1st on trending' that's my Shane!!
Who knew I could love these humans even more than before!! Cancel them all you want, I'm here for always!!
Shane, you have done it again. This is a Masterpiece 🙌❤️‍🔥CHEF'S KISS 💋✨
Dang. I think hes right. This video is at 1m views after 24 hours of #2 trending. If this was 2018 this video would be at 20m+ views already.
jeff really is the only one making shane shine of happiness
It’s not so much that no one is watching on YouTube, I think it’s just natural for creators to grow and try new things (same with viewers). But the beauty of YouTube is you can really morph and change your content to anything. Shane’s content has evolved so much! I love this YT series, I look forward to it more than that new next episode on Netflix!
Can you lower the music,  like there's no audio balance. From barely hearing you to music being in the red.
It’s sad cause I literally only care about YouTube… that’s all that brings me joy…. Keeps my anxiety at bay…
I say no, don’t hang up the button 😢
The cremated palette was something I've been needing my whole life. I'm so glad he made that one. 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
As this has over a million views in a day.
I used to watch jefree non stop even my mom found it strange why i am watching u all the time . I still watch you’re videos ! We will miss you , but i see how happy you are and if quitting youtube will me you happier than why not . We love u ❤️
It’s so good to see Jeffree so happy is such a joy to me.  So sad to hear he is quoting YouTube though.  I still watch the app.  Obviously I’m on here now. Love ya’all
i know im just a nobody and maybe im just a 27 year old loser now, but i still love sitting down at night after i get my kids to sleep and catching up on my favs youtube uploads.... that's one of my favorite things to do... and im still a wanna be youtuber myself..... hearing jeffree put it like that kinda hurt my heart to be honest.. like if THE jeffree star is giving up on youtube, why should i even bother starting..? idk.. shane ryland and jeffree are literally some of my favorites on this planet and id be heartbroken to see them give up just because they arent getting a trillion views... like i know im just one singular view, but yall dont know how much your uploads mean to me.... love to you all <3
sorry Jeffree, you're wrong. There are still so many of us who still care, and Shane, please don't stop posting. Is 1 million views in 1 day nobody to you Jeffree? like cmon.
WE DO WATCH FOR JOY AND ENTERTAINMENT!!  Shane you’re literally #2 TRENDING on all of YOUTUBE. We clearly care or y’all’s number wouldn’t be so high!!
I know how Jeffree feels. I too had to get away from city life and I lived in Wyoming in a town of 300 people (Tensleep) and lived above a bar I worked at. I really enjoyed it it was probably one of the best times of my life. Keep going you can do whatever you want that makes you happy I’m so happy for you
I wish the videos was like 4 hours long lmao I swear I wanted to keep watching more 🥹💗💗
People still watch YouTube. It’s just no one cares about beauty videos anymore. The beauty community was nothing but drama and the same repetitive content.
I agree that people don't watch YouTube like they used to but then there are the creators I go to YouTube just to watch like jeffree and Shane 😭💔
I love how ryland is Shane support system whenever Shane is feeling anxiety or scared 💘💘🥺🥺🥺
Idk what I would do if Shane left 💀
But I agree I’m rarely on YouTube unless it’s to search up how to fix something in my house or on my car or to learn recipes I don’t care for YouTube like that anymore
I love seeing you together again. Kindred spirits! ❤
I hope to God there's a second shane pallette fuck yes I'd buy the crap put of it
i hate this new tik tok wave. the king videos are what get me through my day.
ok so I just had to pause this vid and leave a comment....no one watches youtube......yes we totally do i even canceled cable and just watch youtube, Netflix, and Disney plus. youtube is not dead because the new generation says so.
Jeffree!  What are you talking about?  There are 1 million hardcore Jeffree fans that are watching and sticking by you no matter what!!!!    So just fuck us right? We have been here since the beginning and now that You Tube is in a weird place and your not getting as many views as 3 years ago it's just over?   Everyone on You Tube their views are down... The pendulum always swings back!!!  Don't leave the people who have been with you from the beginning!  Tik Tok sucks it's just people scrolling that's the view your getting not real view from the ones that are actually fans and love you!!  The million or 2 that still watch every you tube video are the same ones who bought conspiracy!!!! That is who is still wT hing we aren't nobodies!!!!!     I hope you have reconsidered!!   I get joy out of watching your videos just like when I watch all of Shane's videos his podcast all Rylands videos and his podcast as well as Morgan!!!!!    I'm really sad.....  Seriously....    I can't even talk anymore I feel like I've been broken up with...
not jeffree saying youtubes dead and I'm still here :')
Why did you change the title of the video for?
Finally someone is talking about it though YouTube has been so dead I feel like I've seen everything on YouTube
Next
And then here we are #2 on trending and 1Million views....if you "fellas"(lmmfao) leave me I'm gonna have to become a TikTok fam jam girl ahhhh guess I'll see your ranch asses there lol lol like I'm not gonna, Ha, pálease
Please never stop creating I love you all so very much!
Omg Shane and Jeffree should do ghost hunting together and make a series out of it 😳 that would be amazing 😍
I disagree completely that no one watches youtube anymore, i much prefer it over streaming platforms etc youtube is my constant entertainment
I’m sad 😞 YouTube was my escape
Nooooooo I don't have tik tok but I'll have to just to see JS 😂
Jeffree I miss your videos. I do still follow you and Shane YouTube does not notify me when you’re on. Yes my button is click to let me know when you have uploaded a video it still does not notify me anymore. But I do still miss you and Shane. Please continue on don’t give up yet.
Ok im literally laughing out loud! Jeffree is SOOO FUNNY omg! Shane always has been but the 2 of yall together is insane 🤣🤣. IM SOOO HAPPY FOR THIS SERIES SHANE!!
I'll always love YouTube!! It's been there for me since I was a lonely 14 year old, I hope it never dies.
I thought you guys were friends. But it seems like you only hang out to film
No one watches you tube.... yet this video is already over 19 million views in 24 hours lol
My heart broke when he said no one watches youtube anymore.... I guess im no one.... I come to youtube to feel better.... watching Jeffree always brought me joy.... I am literally crying at his words!
35:55 literally nothing, just like KS my family’s home 💜love it not a neighbor for miles… outside Bennington
Well I guess Jeffrey was wrong on no one goes to YouTube anymore😂 can’t wait for the next one
The trashing of Youtube at the end seems a little bitter berries. He we all are now watching... on Youtube... I think maybe the viewers moved on? or got bored with self produced drama? It surely happens to most 'famous' people ups and downs of popularity but you can't blame that on the platform.
Love you not even watched yet xxxxx
YouTube is free, Netflix and all those other services are $10+ a month. I’m a college student, I ain’t got money for all that bs, I come on YouTube everyday and if the algorithm doesn’t give me what I want I just search for my favs…makes me sad to hear that even more content creators are switching to tiktok
I still click and I still watch. Love you guys
I'm so glad Jeffree has people like Maddie and the crew from conspiracy still in his life. Great friends are family we pick and they don't come easy. So happy they were able to adjust to the new life. I know it was a huge change, not all can handle that, but that's what family does😉💖💐💋🌟👑
I mean I guess Jeffree has a point cause this vid got like 1M but like other vids would get like 20M I mean from a numbers stand point I get it but like I’m still watching Shane until he decides to quit hopefully that’s when I’m dead and gone cause I really enjoy his content ❤
You know what??? I love Jeffree. I see a brighter version of him now. Even through all the cancellation bs I still love each person individually and always have. I REALLY don’t want him to quit. I really really don’t.
I still watch YouTube everyday
YOUTUBE SUCKS as I sit here binge watching YouTuber videos of my favs 😆 jefree shocks me Everytime
This makes me so sad that Jeffrey feels like this, I still love YouTube, would love a series exploring haunted places where he lives, would miss him so much if he stopped:(
All i have is youtube:( i wish he wouldnt say that but I understand what hes saying
I never stopped watching YouTube. I still love it. But I do understand a lot of people don't watch it anymore.  I never saw Jeffree as a villain, or Shane and many more YouTubers. I'm People don't get we're all human and make mistakes. Cancel culture literally ruined YouTube :/. But I want to see more from this series. Hopefully Jeffree doesn't disappear too
I love watching YouTube. I'm scared all my favorite people are gonna leave it now
jeffree at the airport: mom mode activated
2nd comment not 'there is nothing ' literally the pursuit of happiness. Which the founding fathers ment the pursuit of land/property #theamericandream
Jeffree looks SO HAPPY!  I’m sad he doesn’t read the comments because he looks amazing, relaxed, and happy! ❤️
Jeffrey isn’t wrong, I literally never come on YouTube anymore (I’ve been watching since 2009) it’s all about tik tok 🤣 although, I am here, watching this. So maybe if the content is good enough it’ll draw more people back in 😅
Alright first comment: So much before they even get to his house. The hummer, the gates, and the SILENCER!!! My husband had been going through the process of getting one for 1.5 years now which is .5 longer than regular. Go Jeffree.
i care A LOT about youtube. creators are my only friends. we're still watching.
SHHHAAANNEEEE FINALLY!!! Its so good to see you and Jeffree together again, iconic duo!! Love you guys! Much love from Mexico!
Is anyone else confused? I thought this documentary (based off the title of part 1 from last week) was gonna be about when him (& Jeffree) got canceled last year;  but especially Shane. And giving us like an inside look at what was going on around that time when it went down. Neither last episode nor this episode have done that….
I love YouTube and still watch daily! Don’t go guys we need you 🥺
Youtube is my comfort place. Hearing that YouTube is dead saddens me but jeffree does deserve to let go now
I get Jeffree wanting out. He *has* done it all. And most importantly, people these days are so fastidious with political correctness, that a person as wonderfully irreverent and smart as he is, must feel sooo tired of it all...
How do you know they have left California for real? RYLANDS TAN! He would fit right in yak ranch lol
I’m obsessed. With you two. With Chris, with Ryland, with this series, and with everything you do. Thank you for being a constant light 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I'm sad now.
the yak thing makes me sad :( but i get it
This just kinda made me sad. YouTube has been my only space where all my other problems disappear for awhile. Been watching Jeffrey for ten+ years on here. For him to say he's quitting is heartbreaking. I still look forward to every video that comes out. This is coming from someone who doesn't even wear makeup. I just love the personality. As someone who isn't a fan of TikTok whatsoever and the "instant satisfaction" trend it sucks seeing so many people switch over. Here's to hoping our favorites don't post for a last time.
What a breath of fresh air this is that even JEFFREE motherfucking STAR can realize that there is so much other fulfillment in life than items, videos, and fake friends that are in the same career as you are, that stuff empties a person.  YouTube has always been my happy & safe place to go to in a day &  I will forever miss his videos & I want him to know that I click, enjoy and I care ⭐️🤍
I think you should release the makeup palette 🎨 ✨️ 😍
stop the end has me SOBBING 😿
no be serious i love jeffree, thats so sad
I just love you huys souch! so happy to see you shine and healthy ❤❤❤
I missed them forgive and forget ❤ love you guys
What no jeffree not true I always watch YouTube is still my go to app. No please don’t plant this seed in Shane’s head we need him you both !
Every time I go to Casper, it’s 60+ mph winds 😭😭😭
I love YouTube I’ll never stop watching it .. I stop watching YouTube 😢
Jeffree just seems so happy. And seeing him and shane back together is so refreshing. Their vibes work so well together.
"YouTube is Dead, no one watches it anymore" seriously? 1 million views in a day 🤣
I really hope they announce when Jeffree Star is releasing his book! I can’t wait for that.
L0L Jeffree can be wrong y’all;)
Omg Jeffree leaving YouTube makes me so sad 😭😭 I live for seeing new videos from him on YouTube. I don't have cable so I primarily watch YouTube. It's not dead to me lol 😂😂
I love seeing you all look so happy, healthy and living your best lives. You and Jeffree have provided me with so much laughter and comfort over the years don't stop being you ❤️
I hear what Jeffree is saying.  You Tube has lost some luster, but not everyone has left. I still have my favorite that I watch regularly. I love seeing how happy Jeffree is. I will never have a friend as cool as him or Shane, but with these videos, I almost felt like I did. I rewatch the old stuff all the time. I get it, but will be sad to lose Jeffree.
So fuckin sad how he said everyone wants instant gratification not to watch a whole you tube video so sad I find that to be true about me now but of course I come to watch Shane and Jeffree!and will continue to
It’s funny what Jeffere says. I still come home and relax by watching YouTube. I enjoy YouTube a lot. It’s how i spend a lot of my free time, but it’s true not many people do anymore with streaming sites….
I'm so happy to see Maddie back!
So sad to hear that Jeffree is quitting YouTube but for real, YT is dying. I realized that this year that I wasn't interested in going to YouTube anymore like I used to everyday. When Jenna and the Dolan Twins quit I was like well there's always Netflix. the sad truth. Also I hate TikTok I'm sad Jeffree went to the dark side
Omg you guys have so much of a following I love you guys and I also think 💬 🤔 you should do the pallet if Jeffree is not doing you again cast the haters they know they don't hold candle 🕯️🕯️ to you guys come on 30 million views
I love this side if Jeffery.  But also sad he’s quitting YouTube. I still watch it as much as I did 5 yrs ago
Called an extremist 😂I know cuz I’m one lol it is pretty hard to deal with
Please for the love of everything goof go ghost hunting around Wyoming with jefree as a series I'm begging
looking forward to a potential haunted house series ShaneXJeffree <3
Lol i love that jeffree's moto is "so?" I find it funny because mine is "okay, and?" 🤣 its just funny to me how similar some folks are while also being very different. Im proud of all of you for making this series, its nice to know yall are still doing good for yourselves even after all the bs. Hell yes sis stand right back up and dust yourself off. No one is keeping yall down! Also id like to add that there is definitely some of us who still love youtube, i still aspire to be a youtuber someday. I sit around waiting for shane, morgan,jeffree, ryland and very few others to post. Yall make my days; But jeffree, I'd rather you be happy, so im proud of you for your choice; But ill miss you on youtube.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Shane when you took your time off I was so sad. Please don’t quit YouTube❤️
I am crying.
a couple days ago I started getting a really sick feeling about Jeffree... this is the kind of sick feeling I only get when something is going to happen to affect me harmfully but my choices can prevent it somehow...  idk how my choices can change how Jeffree affects me besides just not consuming content about him... but I really think thats not it.   but how else can I change this? or am I supposed to be protecting Shane somehow?
Aw 😢😢😢
He did not just say our texas slang Is stupid 🥲
I neeeeeeddd a paranormal series of jeffree and shane in Wyoming. Please please please please!
I don’t think YouTube is dead at all, I watch it daily and still enjoy it.
Gont
This turn from glam to guns and animal slaughter is GROSS! Worst series you could’ve done.
Jeffree it's not true! I'm still watching... Your videos, Shanes, Rylands... Tik tok sucks! Nobody needs this shit.
I still care about YouTube!! And I love YouTube still. Watch everyday and has done so good things for my mental health.
“His makeup ended up in tjmax , and we are still friends “ 😂😂 Broo I love them sm
This video was fun, it went by fast, it made sense.  I couldn't even finish that disjointed first episode.  Always fun to see Shane with Jeffree.
It’s heartbreaking hearing him say that YouTube is dying . I still to this day come home and watch YouTube everyday. I’d rather watch YouTube than watch shows on the tv.
Me loving YouTube 🥺 watches YouTube on a daily hearing Jeffree say he’s not going to do YouTube anymore 💔 I’d love to see his day in the life every now and then
This made my week.
It feels right cause it's you... ugh! So good. Also mad that I missed you in Denver airport... :(
Jeffree bringing out the big gun…LITERALLY…was fricken hilarious 🤣🤣
I love YouTube and I’m on it every single day. I look forward to Shane’s videos…
What is the song @ 52:33
I love YouTube. I know tiktok took over but I love long videos and vlogs 😢 I’m sad Jeffree said that
You guys together makes me so happy my fav duo 😂
YouTube isn’t dead. A lot of us go on daily. Maybe it’s just the younger people who don’t use it as much.
I love this, jefree and Shane together make me so happy ❤❤❤
UGHHH IF YALL DONT RELEASE THIS PALLET NOW, I QUIT.
Pausing quick to ask~I live in Colorado and avoid Denver airport if I can!  Why didn’t you just drive?  It would have probably been quicker than walking that damn hub!  In the words of Ralphie May, the end of that place is on the Kansas border! 🤣
But I still enjoy watching YouTube.  :(
The word “Cancelled” has been thrown around quite a bit in this series so far…😏makes me think 🧐 the new palette is called Cancelled, but like that’s wayy too easy of a guess right, like I feel like they’re doing a great job at teasing us 😆 yayy I can’t wait for what’s in store!!! 💄 💋👄
I'm on YouTube daily. It's the only app i open every single day for content. I watch all my faves here. Rewatch Shane's old content so hearing that YouTube is dead and no one cares got me. Because I've been afraid of that. That YouTube really is dead and that all the YouTubers i love to watch will walk away from it =/
Wow! Just wow! Jeffrey  has changed like really changed. His house his attitude his clothes and now leaving You Tube. I'm really happy for him. I can't tell he's just happy and st peace and living his life . I always wondered when everyone was just going to grow up and learn to slow in life.  With Shane and Ryland having a baby and Jeffery  learning money isn't everything  and the wild crazy life isn't for him.  I'm love this vedio so much
Not the "right, fellas?" at the airport
Bittersweet 🥺🥹 It is so refreshing to see the happiness and stress free environment that these hard working peeps have surrounded themselves with! Love you so much! 💜🥰
I still love YouTube but I get it Jeffree. I absolutely love you and Shane together. This series is great and I’m proud of you and Shane for all the growth
Clicked just to dislike ❤️
Excuse me, I’m still here.
Literally all I do is watch YouTube, particularly the older OG series and videos from my fave people like Shane because it really takes me back to a time of pure simple things and happiness. Life currently is this weird ball of weird feelings, over the past few years I’ve lost loved ones and had so many griefs and been in this funk I can’t get out of, I watch these videos that bring my mind back to the happier and easier times and I feel like that is what is truly getting me through this shit show we call life right now. Always have so much love for you Shane and Jeffree ❤️❤️
I rarely comments on these video but hearing Jeffree say no one watch and enjoys these videos makes me wants to say I do and that your energies do have an impact on me. Thank you! And please find a way to keep the connection! :) All th best
Just cause they don't post they think we aren't here. Looking for something... So Yes Shane YeS all they way.
I seriously go on YouTube just for you jeffree and for Shane !!! It is not dead ! Don’t quit YouTube pleaseeeeeeeeeee !! 😢
Okay. Jeffree and Shane are a whole vibe. I have been watching you guys for so so long. I legit just tested up when jeffree said he’s done with YouTube.  I’m a simple person. I don’t have TikTok or Twitter so I will be lost if he goes off of YouTube.  Side note. I am a cancer ♋️ and I have two little boys who are scorpios ♏️ my 2 year old with be three the day before Jeffries birthday. My littlest just turned one on 11/5
YouTube is not dead😂😂  It’s bigger than ever and growing
Jeffree talking about downsizing & wanting to be more grounded & closer to nature was so wholesome. He has came so far & I’m truly happy for him. He seems so much happier.
Youtube stop with the algorithm
No.1 on trending queen
😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰
Not everyone has got tik tok......
Sat in my ohmygod pig T-shirt still having a huge crush on Shane. Propper nostalgic watching these happy Shane videos. ❤
Please I can’t wait to see a second palette!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Nice to see you smiling like this again. You and Jeffree are epic.  Can't wait for the next video.
Jeffrey isn't wrong. YouTube is dying. As much as I love Shane... I did forward this (not the first video he posted recently). It's sad it's like this
I don't think he looks happy, he's not the first person who becomes unhappy and runs away from it all. There's something strange about each time he says he feels better, I just don't buy it, to me he looks like he went through a serious depression and is just now getting out of it.
Yes YouTube sucks
Omg I’ve been waiting for this love your videos and keep making more ❤
who still remembers their first video together 😢
Sigh 🥺 The pandemic changed everything for everyone, I've noticed the reaction channels are struggling for views too lately, I think Jeffery understands that culture is shifting as it always will, and change doesn't have to be dramatic to be draining, YouTube has been my comfort, distraction and education for so many reasons, and I won't be leaving anytime soon, I just hope the channels won't be deleted, the value of the content still matters 🦄
Christ is watching
what is Jeffree talking about, corono made youtube gain even more users and subscribers, his videos and content is still doing really good. I understand if its a hiatus but not for ever.
I watch youtube more then ever, I liiive for rylands videos
Sad to hear he is leaving I just found him recently and u as well and absolutely love watching it’s part of my routine
Shane if you follow in Jeffrey’s footsteps and leave YouTube I will actually cry. We’ve lost Jeffrey we’ve lost Jeanne etc don’t do it
I refuse to leave YouTube and download TikTok. I refuse. Wtf am I supposed to get outta a video that is a couple seconds long?
😭
Never knew Jeffree had restraunts in Wyoming, im in Colorado and Im definetly gonna make the drive just to go.!!
Me watching YouTube everyday only :’(
Jeffree literally just said it with no warning!!!!! 😩😩😩😩 like you can’t just do that do me! I literally choked on a piece of lettuce while eating my salad,cause it was so unexpected!
Loveeeee
The views you get on TIK Tok are a fraction off true views
I hope what Jeffrey is saying about YouTube being dead doesn’t make Shane walk away 😢 please don’t disappear
Happy and sad at the same time
I love YouTube and watching you guys do random stuff just brings me happiness! I can live without everything else but not your series. I live in Germany and I stay up till 11 at night to watch it. At that’s late for me!
YEEESSSSS Omfg omg omg omg Im soooooo excitedddddddd
My god the ending 😢
It seems Jeffree and Shane are both happier.
I’m putting money down now that the pallet is called “zodiac killer”
I think the whole YouTube is dead has a lot to do with how apparently new generations have lower attentions spans and prefer short videos like Tik Tok. That why songs are very rarely longer than 3 mins. I really hope it doesn’t die down. I love watching videos like these and let’s plays
More videos like this please!!!!!
To think I lived in Wyoming for 3 years and hated it so much, I left as soon as I could.
I was busy yesterday but I AM HERE TODAY!
I’m digging this new Jeffree… always liked the old Jeffree, always said i wanted to belong to the house of STAR lol but I’m definitely feeling this new hardy, more grounded Jeffree…
I’m actually sad. Jeffery can’t leave YouTube 😞.
I still watch YouTube daily and use the app often. For homework, social media, and how to do micellaneous things. I wouldn't say YouTube is "dead," per say, but definitely dwindling in viewers. If you want to put something on to play in the background, I always use YouTube. An app like Tik Tok doesn't provide that for me. I do understand where Jeffree is coming from, though.
The filming is so wiggly. Hard to watch🤐
I def still watch YouTube
I think riding Jeffree Stars coat tails isn't.a long term strategy for success Shane.  You do you
I love Jeffree and Shane life updates. You both seem so much more at peace these days 🥺🥰❤️👏🏻
This is the Jeffree that Jeffree was meant to beeee!  <3 He is so comfortable being HIM right now omg. We thought he was comfortable before, he has EVOLVED now.
The music is in this is so underrated
The way they slandered YouTube and this is trending 💀
Omggg i love how happy and beautiful jeffree’s new life is he don’t really show it on his videos but when Shane is around I love how he’s just shining baby yesss ❤️❤️❤️
Literaly cried when jefree said he’s quitting YouTube 😭😭😭 I still love YouTube 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I can't for the next episode!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️
i love this for you Shane yall both just light up my day I'm so proud of jeffree, and yalls growth is insane to me and so inspirational. <3
This broke my heart. I love Jeffrees YouTube I watch every video. I care :/
💀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💀
I still love you Shane, you’re not cancelled in my eyes :)
Actually I think it is smart Jeffree is always ahead of the game. I believe YouTube is over.
I still go on YouTube and watch videos for enjoyment.
I’m clicking them jefree stop I’m cryingggg
Awh but Jeffree we love you!!!
I never watch YouTube really. Tiktok killed attention spans
Jenna marbles 😭
Jeffree saying no one enjoys YouTube anymore or watches it...just isn't true. I already lost Jenna and was devastated by that. I still have my favorites I watch daily and those people have no plans to leave.
Crazy! Jeffree has become so humble and I'm living for it! Him and Shane are the only reasons I come to YouTube really, I don't even wear or buy make up but I still watch every pallet release and beauty update jeffree posts, and I literally live for any shane content that come out. It'll be sad to see him go but if it's what makes him happy then I don't mind, there will always be other platforms. Cannot wait for part 3 to see Shane and ryland living their best yak farm life!
Jeffree is the only person on the planet I wish i was friends with lol
It's understandable for people to say they're upset over Jeffree leaving YouTube, but do you guys see his new life? The new things he's doing? His life has entirely flipped. He deserves to do what's best for his new life. We will miss him, but we can't not support him
Jeffree had over a million views on all his vids up until the most recent two and those have 800k and 600k. How is that “nobody”?
New idea for t-shirt's one with"BOOM" and one with "POUFF"
YouTube is my tv I get home from work, or after a long day, I jump on and watch my favorite creators. It’s like keeping up with my friends and I feel a connection through the people on YouTube.
Jeffree has a point, sadly.  I always watched youtube since '07 but since 2020 I just dont anymore except for Shane's podcast, Sofia, old Jenna, old Simply and old Nikkietutorials.  Youtube just isnt the same anymore but I will always watch Shane's Videos ❤️  PS I wanna see this pallete and cry that I'll never be able to own it!! I love and still ise my conspiracy pallete...fuck the exp date 😂😂
Smart note to end it on... YouTube is dead. Of course it's not. I watch YouTube every day as many others have said here. I understand after so many years feeling like you've done everything. I would love to see Jeffery do GRWM collabs where he chats/interviews other entertainers like drag queens or YouTubers.
Huh? YouTube IS literally ALL I watch!! 😮
Ghost series of Wyoming with Jeffree???😅
💙
Loved this episode! Can’t wait to see part 3,❤
I love the new Jeffree <3
I still love YouTube though….😢
I'm so devastated. You all deserve nothing but happiness and fulfillment. Jeffree got me into makeup, at the age of 30. Something I never knew could be so fun, wonderful, and self expressive. I did my best Shane impression yelling "OH MY GOD!" at the TV. 😭
The last scene make me so f*** sad. Please don't feel that way Jeffree.😔 aw I'm always looking forward to all of your videos.
Jeffree Star makes me realize that no matter how old you get, you can always find your peace. You grow everyday and he's shown me that not everything lasts forever. It's almost breathing in fresh air.
i absolutely love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If Youtube is dead, then we are the ghosts haunting in the empty corridors, suprising sleeping content creators with occasional thumbs ups and eerie whispers in the comment sections. Who's with me? They can investigate our hauntings with REM pods and what not as much as they want - we aint going anywhere!
If he quits YouTube. Can we get a country album? Lol
so the 1million views is equal to no body :/ im nobody to jeffree lol
Can I just say wow jeffrey looks amazing flawless skin absolutely glowing
shane and jeffree ghost adventures PLEASE
YouTube isn’t dead… I check it everyday
it's so sad seeing Jeffree feeling the same way as me and saying the same things about Youtube when he's been my #1 inspiration over the last 10 years to show the magic and the power Youtube can have
Jeffree looks so healthy. He really has seen everything & had everything. To realize that wasn’t everything. I’m obsessed
No no no I love Jeffree and watching him oh my god please give him words of kindness to continue
honestly, i can tell how jeffree has changed. like, yea the phone thing but comparing this video to the last series is vastly different. jeffree’s demeanor is just so much more relaxed. you never really saw him without full glam and now he stays in sweatsuits and a hat. i love it
So sad hearing Jeffree saying “YouTube is dead” 😢 also not me just starting to post again on YouTube 😢 literally just follow what makes you happy
The underground bunker is the secret mansion. The wealthy are doing that while preaching Kumbaya and eat the rich.  Even careers at the level of doctors are doing it.
When Jeffrey brings out the michelada cup mix!!!!! Looovvveee☺️
Hi. Please tell Jeffrey not to quit. I look forward to both of your videos and I enjoy watching them, as soon as they release🥰 I enjoy watching stars videos more than tik tok as I get to enjoy the time he and yourself take the time to share your lives with us! I know I won’t make a difference but just wanted to say and I feel alot of people will think this alsoxx
What do you mean “YouTube is dead”? Glam and gore is BACK! Shane is back! And we are waiting for Jenna. YouTube is reviving ❤️‍🩹
I only watch YT when I’m falling asleep. I pick a video on my main feed click play and slide my phone in my pillow case and fall asleep 😂
Im a little like umm when he said no one watches YT anymore, that’s all I watch.
I loved this! ❤
It's actually sad that the main creators on Youtube think that there is no point of putting out new content, meanwhile me and I believe many more like me are going on YouTube daily to see wether there is something exciting to watch, and get disappointed because most of the time there isn't. I agree that YouTube is losing its popularity and isn't the most viral platform anymore, but only creators like you and Jeffree can still keep it alive.
People are watching Youtube, they just aren't watching YALL.
jeffree is doing so good right now! makes me happy
Jefree is admirable when it comes to how he takes what life throws at him changes things and still comes out successful
I love Jeffree Star ⭐️🫶🏼
i am so proud that jeffery came to that realization and is living a better life like he wanted and is happier. that's really what it's all about. He actually can relate to way way more people now too. so thankful for this
Lol , when Jefree pulls out the gun lol 😂 Shane looks like bitch What 😮 love y’all ❤❤❤❤
In case anyone can help, I'm staying on a friend's couch since my mom tried to pew pew me a few days ago. I have a job but I'd like my own place asap $Youngd0peproud
“YouTube is dead” looks like “finally we have all we wanted and we have enough money to live our luxury lives without your views and monetization, we don’t want to entertain you for money anymore, byyye”.
YouTube is dead for some, but not all. I’m still on here daily and love watching all of you guys. Seeing Shane, Ryland, Jeffrey, or Morgan upload literally makes my day. I find myself rewatching a lot of old videos to fill the void of people not uploading as much.
bruh i have youtube going at literally all hours of the day
I’m crying…. The ending is just 😩😩
Jeffree girl, we get that you're fierce and savage. It oozes from your face and aesthetic. I dont get why we're still acting this way mid 30s.  Personally as someone who has been sober and will not drink anymore, I'd never keep liquor in my home 🤷🏼 Idk dispute it, it's probably best he leaves
Jeffery looks so gorgeous and healthy. I love it so much.
Hello Shane! After so many years I could finally afford your pallete!! I'm in tears since yesterday because it was so hard to purchase from Brazil, but I did it! Just to let you know that are some people from far away, just like me, that still supports you and want to be a part of your accomplishments! Love u from all my heart
he could’ve done morning routines at the ranch , day in the life’s .. vlog style ! i think everyone would enjoy those from Jeffree..
This video alone at 19.5M views… people are still watching YouTube
Please don't ever quit YouTube Shane!! I Still watch YouTube every day and enjoy it just as much as I used to. I love long vlogs and no 30 second clip can ever replace it.
I truly adore this Jeffree. I hope it's not a facade and it's actually real. He's finally found true peace and happiness. That's amazing for him! California really makes people greedy. So glad they all got out of there! 🙏
Is it just me or do I just feel like I have a new respect for Jeffrey. This 360 is insane I respect his new persona.
Watching Jeffrey always give me nostalgic memories
I love ryland but who dresses to impress at an airport? I’ve never understood that need to garner attention and make people try to like you or impress them based off the way you look.
FAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!!
I love all of yall so much!! I just hope yall are living your best lives! I love seeing Jeffree so happy on his ranch and I love seeing Shane making videos again. It's bittersweet but love for all of yall 🧡🧡🧡🧡
Jeffree saying no one watches YouTube for fun anymore when I’m sitting here watching YouTube daily for my favourite channels. I watch it more than Netflix. 😢
Goes to see jefree star channel latest video 600k that's still alot
PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU GUYS DO A GHOST SERIES WHERE YOU HUNT AND STUFF. ITS THE ONLY SEROTONIN IN MY LIFE
Jeffree look sooooo good and happy… more than ever… i love to see him like that. And Shane&Ryland so so cute and they too look so happy and graunded more than ever like Jeffree.
“They only made 3 of these bags. Me, Beyoncé, and Rihanna have one.” DAAAAAAMN Jeffree’s that bitch.
YouTube is never dead for content this good ❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰 love you guys together !!!!! Release the pallet I’ll buy it lmao
I'm so sad. I love youtube. I still watch daily for fun.
I swear if Shane leaves youtube too im going to say fuck youtube and get my life together to as well, I'm over it watching all the people i watched as a kid up to 27 years leaving youtube, its become a cringe ass tick tock reacting hell hole on this platform and makes me so sad... 😭
Boost
Boost
Boost
Jeffree and Shane together ❤ my two favourites
Ironically I was reminiscing on how I used to love setting up the tv and snacks to watch my favorite YouTube influencers. Nowadays it’s so different with the shorts/reels and I agree with Jefferee. Thank you both for all the laughs, dark humor, and simply being yourselves. Can’t wait to see more 🫶 Do what makes you guys happy & fuck the rest 🧡💅🏼
Suggestion. Can we get a series of where Shane and friends travel across the USA exploring popular haunted locations. That would be fantastic 🤩
He’s not wrong but the only videos I get excited to watch and watch immediately are yours Shane! You ARE YouTube to me 🎉
WE NEED A PARANORMAL SERIES WITH SHANE AND JEFFREE. Side note tho, I absolutely love this, I missed all of you together, your all so happy 🥺💛
I actually like this Jeffree Star. He seems more at peace.
What song is there at 52:30 on the background?
Why did I not get notified about this video I've been so excited to watch and now almost a day after posted I'm seeing it
It's so nice to see you thrive again and to see this other side of jeffree. You both seem to bring out the best in each other 😊
I love this new series please don't stop you Shane or Jeffree Star please continue to do videos I love your videos
I love everything you put out, Shane. You and Jenna Marbles have kept me smiling and laughing for many years. When you went offline, I felt like I lost an important friendship - I always loved seeing your mom and all of the dogs when you still lived together. I hope you don't quit YouTube. You're honestly so talented and I can't wait to be sitting in theaters someday, nachos in my lap, anxiously awaiting your brilliant horror film. I'm still looking forward to that day... You're going to keep improving, especially with Ryland and Chris by your side.
i’m still watching from day 1 🥹🥹
I’ll always love watching you, Shane. Even Ryland. I immediately click when I see a new upload from either of you.
This video is sooo wholesome 🙏🏽 it’s giving me hope for my future. Currently going through some dark times and I’m praying to see some light at the end of my tunnel. Seeing you guys transition from dark times to the light is soo amazing. Wholesome to be exact 💙 I love it!
The ending of this made me feel very depressed, I literally have a channel where I post stuff on and I watch YouTube more then streaming stuff. I'll always be one of those people that's always on YouTube it's not gonna change.
oh my.. i live jeffie,, please do not give up. at least keep going into shanes vids please xxx
I don’t want YouTube to be dead. I don’t want to see all my favorites disappear. There are still people who watch. It makes me Worry that we aren’t going to have anyone to Watch anymore
Make more paranormal videos pleaseeeeeeeeee
I live on YouTube :( idk why all my favs are leaving
I love this series! Seeing all of what has happened and the growth they've both made is incredible! Can't wait for the next part. 🥰
I still care im still clicking to view i love watching yall
YouTube is not dead. Beauty YouTube might be but the numbers show, YouTube is still very much alive! Love you and love Jeffree… hope y’all keep creating forever!
Im actually so sad i will miss jeffrey on youtube but if this is what makes him happy i understand he made me so confident to wear makeup that is out of the ordinary him and shane made me feel more confident and i will forever be thankful for you both
I don’t think “YouTube is dead” I think maybe a certain type of content may be dead. But I know that when Shane took time away from YouTube I watched so many of his old videos waiting for this come back so YouTube isn’t dead we’re still here! I just think beauty and makeup videos aren’t it anymore but Shane’s style videos definitely are!!
News flash Jeffrey- I watch YouTube daily and I’ve been subscribed to you, Shane and Ryland for years! If you did vlogs like a day in my life….you would definitely have people watching. Yes people aren’t wearing makeup like they used too due to Covid and masks but ALL I watch is YouTube! Please don’t stop posting!  Shane and Ryland- don’t you dare stop posting either!!! I love all of you!!!
So sad to hear Jeffree is quitting youtube.. I'm on it all the time and 9 out of 10 times I'll watch what Jeffree posts.. but he's right.. the platform is dying even though many of us are still here watching content.. GEN Z doesn't have the attention span for it..
i miss shanes conspiracy theories where he use to just sit on a couch and talk
I think YouTube might be dead in the beauty community but idk I watch let’s players move from Twitch to YouTube all the time now and they’re thriving
Please read comments this time :(
PLEASE DO PARANORMAL VIDEOS OR SERIES WITH JEFFERY YOU GUYS ATE HILARIOUS AND I LOVE GHOSTS
Jeffree seems so chill 🥰
You know that feeling when you waited something for a long time and then forgot about it AND THEN it came out...that feeling is amazing.
Rug
the camera man needs to work on his filming.,,, the light is too overblended,,,
Love you guys are back together your videos are the only reason why I go on YouTube. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻☘️
🙄
I started crying when he was talking about quitting YouTube. I don’t know how to let go. Lol
It was a strategy so people go and watch lol I think
Jeffree leaving YouTube is gonna be a cultural reset 😭😭😭😭
Jeffree pulling out the gun was the funniest thing ever 😂😂 shane was SHOOOOK
This is so much better than I imagined. And I had high hopes.
I go on YouTube everyday looking for contemt to watch.. but youtubes stuoid fking algorithm only shows me the ssaaaammmmmeeee bs channels over and over and over and over even tho im subscribed to hundreds
I feel like YouTube is becoming more  and more of a ASMR platform and food review and product review platform  Tik Tok is taking over the more fun videos
It made me sad to hear Jeffree say that YouTube is dead considering I'm on here watching videos from all my favorite creators daily, but I also get it. YouTube really hit its peak ten years ago and has kind of gone downhill from there; a lot of people I used to watch have switched over to Tik Tok, or Twitch, or stopped making video content all together. It's disappointing but it's the reality of it, YouTube isn't nearly as hyped as it used to be 😕
JEFFREE DON’T LEAVE
Youtube is still my main entertainment center, I truly hate TikTok. Most of TikTok's content is based on vanity and I cannot stand those robot voices. It makes me sick. I think (and hope) this short-vanity-clips-with-robotic-voice trend ends soon with a big band. People will hopefully want to see good and meaningful content again. I really hope so. This short-clip content is like fast food - you might feel good for a second, but it doesn't really nurture your needs in the long run and you'll become sick and deprived. Youtube is not dead, the crowd is has run to see a temporary pop up show for a moment and they'll come back sooner or later when their souls get hungry again.
Cancel culture was such an uneeded. If YouTube died out it was thanks to cancel culture and their witch hunt. Never is there a need to attack a person till they are diminished from a Plat form, it's just ridiculous. Just the other day I kept thinking about how YouTube isn't what it used to be and a lot of my favorite videos are older videos and nothing new. Jeffrey really took the words out my mouth. He is so mature and instead of trying to keep hype from the same things he constantly makes things gold and flourishing. BIG respects to him, truly.
jeffrees lil nail glisten at 22:18 with the gun how fuckin perfect
So good to see you guys together again, love from chile.
I mean it is true. Shane used to have over 20 million views. It’s not the same to them. But I still watch all my favorite content creators from over 4 years ago.
So like as someone who lives on YouTube this hits.
I always open YouTube before any streaming service. Real fans are here still, you’re not getting as many views anymore because the drama and the cancel culture people aren’t around for it anymore. We’re here 🫠
Omg “as long as you don’t use they or them your fine”haha yes laughed out loud so hard
I just love Jeffrey and Shane to the moon and back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don't know, I feel like there's nothing to watch anymore, like the content from YouTube went away to apps I totally hate like TT or other. I remember how much I loved the videos you guys made, Jeffree made etc. I was waiting for them, I still cherish and watch the old videos over and over coz they mean something for me, not the new generation... It's just that the new content is stupid now, Shane is one of the few youtubers, for me, who keeps doing interesting and "deep" stuff... the time and the generation has changed. It's like my older sister said that Britney Spears and Rihanna were her everything well they're not for this generation anymore and for us it's sad, but we have to move on and that's OK
I'm mean he wasn't wrong in saying utube is dead. Look at how much time it takes to film and edit. To get less than 1 million views in 24 hours... on tiktok you can rack up views so quickly. I still love watching their videos but I'm just one person.
Aww I'm loving this! I love YouTube still and always watch everything you both put out it will be sad for him 2 go. Cant wait for part 3 ❤️
I love jeffree & seeing him in Wyoming makes me happy. I wish him so much happiness in this next chapter of his life ( after YouTube )
30:55 what is he saying?
i forgot how much i miss shane and jeffree together 😭❤
I know this comment isn’t gonna get attention but I have rewatched all your videos I love watching you create looks that are Always on point I’m soo happy your a Positive space thank you for all The  make up lesson they have helped me with my make thank you soo much. Jeffree star❤
I get so excited to see your videos , you guys are the best
Seeing Jeffree and Shane reunite made me so happy! 💖
It’s so nice to see you guys together . You guys still  friends to the good , bad and the BETTER. 😂❤
Jeffery cleaned the fuck up! what a queen... i love this side of him now... 💕
MORE OF y’all PLZ
Um listen I do still watch lots of YouTube but I feel it tho
Jeffree looks so good 🥰💖
Oh God part 2 to the Jeffree starr bullshit noone cares maybe you should retire too if this is what you wanna do is Interview a douche bag he should go to a island and isolate hisself away from everyone tbh he should have never been able to be on youtube I think this was the dumbest way to spend you time from the podcast I think you could have recorded yourself taking a sh1t for 60 mins and I would had watched that video before I'd watch either of these videos
I really hope you guys change your mind and release a different palette 🥰
The world is ready for nuclear war.  Definitely.
Respectfully Speaking: To hear Jeffree Star say he's going to make two videos on YouTube & then he's done because Humbly Speaking he believes that YouTube is dead & that no one watches his videos when literally my heart just overflowed with emotion because every time I get a notification I get so excited that he actually uploaded a YouTube video which I'm not the average person and no disrespect to anyone if it's a makeup review or new brand launch of an item or just a random vlog I'm excited to see it and yes he has the right to retire from YouTube if you want to because like you said he has worked his butt off and I will respect this decision but to say that no one watches his videos anymore that is absolutely 💯😪💯😪💯😪💯 Not True...!!! And like I said in the beginning of this I am not like the average person I am a young person who enjoys YouTube and Instagram only and when it comes to YouTube I enjoy long content when I do have the time to watch it after I complete things in my daily life I come on YouTube everyday after I say my prayers and before I go to sleep to watch all my favorite YouTubers and that is enough social media for me for other people who love to be on every form of social media and to all my other favorite creators who have tick tock I'm very happy for them I just don't want to overwhelm myself it's just not my thing to fully consume myself with social media if that makes sense Respectfully Speaking: & yes I know this comment is (LONG) but I really had to express how I was feeling after this episode I just wish Jeffree Star had a button that showed him the positive comments after he uploads a video no matter the content & the number of people who really are for him that are still (watching) his contact but but if it is about a high number for him like I said I will respect his decision if he decides to leave YouTube forever😪🌟  Os. I pray God continues to keep him blessed & his creativity continues to flow with all of his businesses no matter what he continues to do in this life with an unselfish heart God knows I mean it💯🙏🏼💯🙏🏼💯🙏🏼💯  &  (ALWAYS) I love you BOTH (ALWAYS) have (ALWAYS) WILL....!!!    ♿🌈📖💍🙏🏼Shalom🙏🏼💍📖🌈♿
Jeffrey is going to transition maybe ????
“No one watches YouTube anymore” - this video currently has 960k views. 🙃 I enjoy watching YouTube. Long-form videos are much better than short-form, in my mind.
You are amazing Shane! 💛
These  videos with Shane make me so emotional. I get goose bumps when the things he speak touch my soul. I am so proud of this group of people. I truly adore and respect this bunch! Thank you guys!
Honestly, I duno what Jeffree is talking about...I literally live on youtube over any other platform, I prefer content over shows!🤪
PLEASEEE sell the pallett!!!!!!!
It’s not fair, Jeffree is a hot dude too?! One person shouldn’t look so good in everything, come on.
WE ARE SEEING, YOU HEARD!!
I still watch YouTube everyday but I watch mostly vintage shop alongs since I resell. I only watch Ryland/Shane/Trixie. Glad your still doing videos 👍👍
❤❤❤
Jeffree's outlook on life these days is refreshing. Super inspiring so see someone who was such a core part of social media for so long take a step back and enjoy life without caring what others think anymore.
I love seeing you all together again 😍 the way life has changed for you all is amazing to see 🥰 I actually shed a tear watching this 🥹
Elton John 😂
Shane!! I woke up this morning feeling so down. Then I watched your video and smiling the whole time! I love these types of videos
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I hate that Jeffree feels like this because I still use YouTube because I get tired of all the other apps
27:25 shane you look cute here
I loved watching this! Jeffree seems so happy living out in Wyoming! I am sad to hear he doesn’t want to do YouTube anymore, but I also understand.
The comment section shows just how loyal Shane and Jefree's fan base is on Youtube. It sucks to leave so abruptly because it gives off the impression views are more important than the amazing community they have on Youtube.
Once you feel that you lived to your fullest potential and you just wanna feel free it’s time to do things is are happiness to you, and just live.
Love you guys so much <3 It brings me so much joy to you see you both together and happy!!!
I am shocked because I watch YouTube all the time and itmakes me sad that jeffree is talking about stopping YouTube. I hate tiktok it's so pointless damn this makes me so sad
So hes quitting Youtube? and gonna be on shitty TikTok instead??? Omg
YouTube is far from dead. Jeffrey has tunnel vision most of the time. Precisely why he made another video with you. Profit. He should thank YouTube.
I think ever since what happened w YouTube and y'all, it kind of tarnished my view. This place can be toxic like Twitter and I only hop on every once in a while. YouTube is kind of dead
I love Youtube more than I love any other app!!!
I’m sorry but Shane being afraid of the guns has me rolling 😂
Let the haters hate and we will just enjoy the good old times! Welcome back you two!!!!!!!
I cannot say goodbye to my comfort people they have helped me through everything
I watch jefreees vids
When you realize you live right by Shane Dawson omfg
Its awsom ikspily wen your pregnant
Omw we need that haunted series with jeffree, and don't forget Morgan. That'll be amazing.
I will always still watch Shane. YouTube or not. Still my favorite creator.
I feel like this videos a little shady lol 🌴🌚
Why did the name change from “The retirement of Jeffree Star” to “The new world of Jeffree Star” ???? Am I crazy?
Everybody is streaming now off YouTube— talk about changes.
No shade but maybe YouTube is dead for the content he would share but i def love what you and Ryland put out love the podcast love the daily blogs of Ryland and love your series and even Vlogs you guys are literally one of my top fav YouTubers and i look forward to when you guys post and can’t wait!!!! 🥺😭
I watch you all I CARE
YESSSS!!!!!!!! IM SO EXCITE! LES GOOOOO🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ THANK U FOR THIS SERIES! I feel like y’all my homies fr!! Obsessed with u both!
I completely disagree that YouTube is dead, It’s the only platform I go to for entertainment. Not a fan of TicTok. To short on the content, I want a nice long video. Hope you don’t quit Shane. 😢
😂 the end  YouTube is dead meanwhile this video is #1 on trending
J.S.  "NO ONE'S CLICKING" YOUTUBE #1 ON TRENDING.  There's definitely a decline but it's perhaps because creators are also burnt out, everyone needs a break, imagine doing the same job for so many years. 😭💛
I watch YouTube over any other app! So to hear this at the end saddens me a bit! 😥😢💔
NOOOO SHANE AND RYLAND!! I literally love your guys videos sooooo much do not think YouTube is dead i watch so much more YouTube than tv or streaming sights please read your comments and see the ppl still love you and YouTube 🥺🥺🥺
I love this series already, I must be in the minority that really loves YouTube though😢
If I ever see you guys at DIA, I will lose my mind with joy and excitement 😃😃
All I'm going to say is Good on Jeffree for quitting Youtube! It was time!
Jeffery just pulls out an gun 😂 Also one with a silencer. The only reason you need a silencer is if you kill someone and you don’t want anyone to hear. Jeffery a mobster.
I love this so much 😭😭😭 jeffree is living his best life and I’m obsessed. Couldn’t be happier for him 🥰
PLEASE JEFFREY DONT QUIT. PLEASE. SHANE KEEP GOING. RYLAND ILY. OMG I WILL CRY IF YOU GUYS GO AWAY 😭😭😭😭
Baby, we’re still watching YouTube. His views tanked because he got cancelled 😵‍💫
Seeing this video trending is proof that people still care.  Losing Jenna and Shane at around the same time left a huge void for so many of us.  I'm glad Shane is back, and I hope that Jenna is happy with however she's choosing to spend her life away from youtube.  I feel like there is finally some push back on cancel culture recently and I only hope the trend continues.
I love Jeffrey's shoes in the airport. Can I have them?
YouTube is literally all I watch for enjoyment and fun lol Shane please don’t quit 😭❤️
OMG when Jeffree said "quitting Youtube" my jaw instantly dropped but I get it. All the work needed for a video just goes away cause everybody is scrolling on Tik Tok. You do you Jeffree, find your inner peace :) <3
Breaks my heart, I’m on YouTube everyday!! I love YouTube so much
I still watch youtube for fun 🤧 Maybe im just...old...😭
What's with the fake laughter every 10 seconds?
SEEING THEM TOGETHER AGAIN MAKES SO HAPPY
What Jeffree said is kinda true lol no one watches YT anymore. I only check in to see like 5 ppl and that’s it.
Lol whatever. People will get burned out from TikTok too. There’s only so many times you can watch TikTok videos and not feel your brain cells rapidly deteriorating from all the fast paced videos you keep scrolling past over and over. I had to delete the app, it melts your brain. YouTube can make you sit down and actually hold your attention longer. Not as draining. People will learn
Release the palette!
Shane, I am 5’3 and pretty tiny 😅 I still rip the thighs out of my pants it happens to the best of us 😂
Love it love you guys
Anyone catch the video when it was called 'The Retirment of Jeffree Star?' I saw that n was like damn...wth. I get it tho.
Jeffree seems like a true entrepreneur who knows how to make money be it makeup or beef jerky 😂 loving this series so far.
WHAT  NO !!!!!!!!!!!  ATLEAST DO VLOGS JEFFREE PLEASE  IM 😭 OMG IM CRYING NOOOOOOOOOOOOO ATLEAST DO VLOGS PLEAZE 😭
I missed these videos from Shane so much it´s borderline embarrassing
honestly I felt as though Jeffree was going to quit youtube soon, I'm so proud of him and it's so nice to see he's found this side to him that he feels happier in. I cannot wait for the last video of this!!
I’m honestly so upset Jeffree doesn’t feel inspired and wants to retire 😢 I’m going to miss him 😭😭
The fact that this whole video was a hummer commercial like…
These are some sus af comments.
Shane im sending all this love from all the way in dubai I've been watching you ever since I was a kid and im 23 now love you, keep going never stop please
I love seeing this side of Jeffree. It makes me sad that “no one” is watching anymore. Guess I’m still a no one.
If I ever find out that you were completely done with YouTube and going to something else I will follow you but I will be severely sad even though it’s like once a year that I get a series to watch but I love your content don’t ever stop making it!!!!🎉❤❤❤
@3:34 deff making more makeup
I still use my conspiracy palette all the time ❤️
Shane and Jeffree together is so much good, contagious energy!!! Even though jeffree is quitting, i really hope he still does a lot of collabs with Shane. It makes me soooo happy
People are still watching YouTube. They're just not watching jeffree star.
I have been here following someway or another since day 1. Watching you leave YouTube is going to be the biggest timeline jump on a different level. I am so astonished with who you are today vs 2007 Jeffree. As a die hard fan, I'll be here till you don't want to be found❤️
"YouTube's dead no one watches anymore" meanwhile most of Jeffree's videos get well over 1 million views 😅🙈  It might not seem like a lot if you have 15m subs but that's still a LOT of people 😬 Then again you should do what makes you happy and gives you joy in life. I just hope Shane stays 🙏
So happy you guys are back together. Stay strong, be a family.
I LOVE youtube, I go here for everything ♡ I watch nerdy videos of interesting people living different lives.
Please tell him he should not quit YouTube. YouTube brings a lot of extra traffic along with TikTok even if his views have dropped to 1million each video. YouTube is one of the most used search engines along with TikTok and if something happens to TikTok because of things going on with the government and China, YouTube will still be around. Quitting YouTube would be a bad business move if he wants to have an extra way to earn easy side income with an already established audience.
I was smiling the whole video...then the end hit me 😔
Coming from a red state the shock of the gun left me unbothered. 🙃
Btw Shane you look really really good. So happy to see you
Jeffrey Star is a braindead weird ass.
I don't think he should quit YouTube, that's really sad. Jeffree says nobody is watching but he still gets a million views. It's sad when you don't value that
Jeffrey: “no one is clicking anymore,””YouTube sucks!”  YouTube: #1 trending ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jeffrey looks so handsome 🙃
I loved this video (:
omg I loved this video so much! but like I enjoy it so much, thank you shane and jefreey! so guys are so special for me.
I had a prejudice opinion about jeffree and Shane after the conspiracy series. But honestly, this side of them is so refreshing, I can feel that they’re being so genuine about their feelings and where they are in their lives. The self growth is amazing 🫶🏻
No Jeffrey. !!! You can’t quit YouTube
I'd say the beauty side of YouTube is dead.
I will respect Jeffree choosing to quit Facebook to make him happy but it will make me very sad to see him go. We love his content.
Jeffree saying he gets no views anymore - i go on his channel and every single video has one million plus views....
Got really emotional to see jeffree leaving YouTube, but I am so happy to see HIM happy. He deserves it ❤️
We really enjoy JS content hope he will still making more videos in YT.
The way he went from poor to wearing Gucci as his workout shoes
Shane you gotta sponsor???
Jefree is one very very clever business woman. Right you there with Kris Jenner! Except he is woke!
Jeffree if you need a dog babysitter hit me up!
I agree YouTube’s dying it too polluted with nonsense videos and tutorials, the top YouTubers kept getting cancelled for things left right n centre over silly n sometimes big issues but at the end of the day we loved them n we wanted to watch them n now they don’t want to anymore cause it’s been made so hard for them to do anything without backlash. We’ll watch them do anything like he said millions of views on a Walmart trip, it’s not about the content sometimes it’s about the person but it’s being made so hard for anyone to say or do anything on here or anywhere
Your true fans WILL ALWAYS WATCH!
I'm REALLY happy for Jeffree! He really does look like his heart is happy. For the record, I still watch YouTube 😂
Amazing, live for these videos 🤍💗
I love the grounded and real Jeffree!
I will forever watch YouTube I love it💕
jeffree is literally a fucking billionaire icon fucking business man fuckin legend😭😭😭
This was everything I had goosebumps multiple times watching this . I love this ✨️ and everything about it !
im so happpyyyyy seeing this group back together 🫶🫶🫶
during the pandemic i discovered you tube and ditched everything else looks like I'm 18 years too late!!
Why is Chris arm so shaky?
Jeffree star is the person I saw first influencer in YouTube when I purchased my phone for the first time in 2017 It was so fun everytime and I was inspired alot that now I want to start my own makeup line but seeing your video pic at the beginning broke my heart 😭
Are we just gonna act like they didn't do what they DID? Where the fans who love to say "but they apologized". Jeffree is a BAD influence on Shane. Scorpios are EVIL and manipulating puppet masters (Jeffree)
im so excited that your videos are trending ! Been here a long time and have always supported you. Im so glad to see your getting out of your shell and growing! Sending love!
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF JEFFREE I LOVE YOUTUBE!!!! 😆 ❤ #LOVEMESOMEYOUTUBE LOVE YOU ALLLLLLL
We need the Shane and Jeffree ghost series NOW!!
I care about YouTube!!
This is so wholesome! Love it! Glad you guys are back!
I needed this series
I love Shane and Jeffree’s friendship. This video gives off “we are going to see our super rich uncle Jeffree” and I’m all for it.
I need this faster then once a week 😢
I watched you all when I was a teenager and even younger now I’ve work all the time I’m too busy to watch unfortunately xx
"B.C. Before Cancelation" That was everything.
Shane and Jeffree together are my FAVORITE 🤣💕
Why do you keep posting about Jeffrey star? I’m just curious?? Is he paying you for this? I love your content but you’re always making it about him? Why
It’s so weird living in Casper almost my whole life, and watch Shane and Jeffery like 10 years ago as a kiddo….out of all the places…Casper Wyoming 😂😂 even weirder when I see them out and about. Wth 😂
Not a fan of Jeffrey but love Shane.
Fuck tick tock!! I feel like tick tock has no heart or substance. You watch a short clip of something and forget about it instantly. YouTube is amazing! I rewatch old videos of my favorite YouTubers and get so excited for new content. Please keep making your awesome video's.
Love seeing these two together again. Their friendship is so special. Shane has such an ability to make Jeffree be so relatable, and real. Sometimes I wish Shane wasnt as worried about the “series” when hanging with jeffree because you can  tell jeffree just wants to see his friend not be interviewed. Jeffree it’s so good to see you find peace and sanctuary and still be killing it! A true icon!
"Because I had a EXHAUSTING fucking game, what do mean??"
Jeffree looks awesome. I couldnt figure out what was so different about him until i noticed he has eyebrows lol I like.
Jeffree looks amazing. He looks young and healthy. I get that cosmetic things can be done BUT it looks different than that. We all do certains things or act a certain way after a major break up and it looks like Jeffree has fully bounced back. I'm 39 and it's funny to see grown folks suddenly grow up but we do. Funny how we evolve and still grow when we think we're already grown. Y'all are going in the right direction. ❤
Omg I miss these videos!!!! So happy to see you.
I'm still clicking!
I must be old school then, cause I love watching YouTube……going to miss you J⭐️
Omg those last 5 min broke my heart
Sooo happy for Jeffree BUT we do still care!!!! I can’t stand this app - I literally come here for Shane, Ryland, Jeffree, & Lizzie…. I come here SO happy when y’all post new videos!! We do care and still love y’all!!! ❤️❤️❤️
i still watch youtube. im so sad that all my favorites are giving it up since the pandemic. please shane. please... dont ever quit youtube.
I watch YouTube every day. There are so many creators on here I love, however, most of them are not in the beauty community. I think there are other communities that are doing fine, and getting 50k views on their videos for them is amazing. They’re not worried about 5 million views to feel relevant.
Petition for Jeffrey and Shane to release the cancelled pallet right before Jeffrey retires 🥲
When you realise that you’re a dinosaur. I hate tik toc! Lol
Jeffery looks so full of life and he is much more present! Like someone else in the comments I also teared up seeing Jeffery walk into the airport. Seeing you both reunited brings back conspiracy flashbacks 😢 LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH❤❤❤
I really hope this leads to a pallete release. 🥰
Well this was way more emotional than I expected it to be. 😢
he is kind of right about youtube fizzling out. there is still a place for it for sure and people still consume content here- but as with all things on the internet, things change. attention shifts. if you don't change with it, you get left behind.
Can we please have Jeffrey on the podcast? 🥹 Missed y’all’s content so much!!!
Lol @ Shane asking if Jeffrey puts his hand inside the yak
I am very happy for Jeffree, he looks so calm and relaxed, but "You tube" is not dead, come on, if it was, no one was gonna wait patiently for that series, for example. So for him maybe he feel like it and he want to move on with something else, but YT clearly is not dead, I literally can't wait on every video posted from the persons I follow, especially from Shane, the podcast, Ryland, Morgan... They are my therapy and my happy time! So please Do not quit You Tube, there are still millions of people wathching ! ❤️❤️❤️
i still watch youtube! i click! i literally watch multiples times a day  mornings on my lunch and when i get home!
I still love Youtube
Shane legit nutted his pants when Jeffrey mentioned Wyoming’s ghost activity 😂
I hope shane never quits , well atleast for now 🥲
I’m so thankful for everyone on YouTube. I watch it every single day. It helps me so much mentally and gives me a sense of friendship and community. I’ve gained so much perspective from watching and listening to people go through so much, and live such different and unique lives to my own. I think that people are craving community, socialization, adventure and humour so much now and that’s why people come back to watch their favourites again and again. YouTube has helped my mental health so much for over a decade, I don’t know where I would be without discovering creators through this app
I feel like everything is good again with these two back together 🥹❤️
I just love the whole vibe of this video! Jeffree just exudes happiness now! In LA I feel like he felt like he had to top everything and prove to himself he wasn’t struggling financially anymore and it just took over his life and eventually made him almost miserable but I feel like in Wyoming he has gotten in touch with who he was always meant to be and what he truly loves! You can just feel his happiness through the screen! And I know he said he quit doing Botox and fillers yet he looks sooo much younger now than he did when he was getting Botox and fillers! Happiness and peace looks so good on Jeffree! And I love when Jeffree and Shane are together, you can tell they genuinely love each other and have such a true and genuine friendship and I love that for both of them! 💕 Also I’m kinda sad Jeffree is quitting YouTube, that honestly shocked me but if it doesn’t bring him joy anymore then he should let it go and do what makes him happy! 💖
Loving the old, easy flow connection between y'all with a new vibe. It feels good. I hope the positivity continues. Also, Shane will always be effortlessly comical. He's just so good at delivering humor at the perfect moment whether it's 1 line, a reaction or whatever else he comes up with.
gahh - I forgot how much I love watching you guys all together 😭🫶🏼 missed it!!
It’s incredibly sad to hear Jeffree say YT is dead. That may be true (it’s not to me) but I just want to say that I’ve ALWAYS stayed with YouTube. I downloaded TikTok a literal year after it got popular and have only been on that app less than a handful of times. I don’t like shorter videos. I like this. I love yt and I know a lot of us still do and are sad to see you go. 😢but we support whatever you want to do, Jeffree and we’ll always be here if you want to come back. ❤️
was that a car commercial in the middle? 😉
This is such a calming video. Even with all the Jeffrees super conservative lifestyle. Which is hilarious and heart warming tbh. But like after following them both for year and years and years. We go through life riding waves and going through the motions. And I believe whole heartedly the meaning of life is contentment. Finding that happy place. And I think Jeffree’s done it. (I mean basically what he said but I’d have to agree)
It’s also hard to stay engaged when there is a video a month or wait 6 months for a video. I watched religiously back in 2018/2019
Y’all told me he was canceled 😣
YouTube videos have millions and billions of views, it for sure isn't dead. And yes a haunted series would be great, thank you!! Love y'all ❤️
How does Jeffree get internet out there?????
YES SHANE YESSSSSSS
Jeffrey is so right when he says TikTok has intensified our need for instant gratification now instead of enjoying the process of learning to get to the end result. Wow..loved this 🤍
That is so sad honestly I watch YouTube soooo much honestly and it’s my main form of entertainment still so it’s sad to see some of the best YouTubers leaving
I wish I could see Shane in person, also it's nice to see Jeffrey at peace.
Not my two favorite people rising from the ashes
I miss the Jeffree videos that showed stuff he was doing or just hanging out. I enjoy that type of stuff a lot. Seeing how happy You, Ryland and Jeffree are literally makes me cry. 😅I have missed all of you guys posting so much!! ❤ Love all you guys!
Im honestly here for it, but man the ending made me so nostalgic like im really growing up. Im about to be 26 and have been watching youtube since the 2010’s. The passing of time 🥲 like all the hp cast passing away recently. Such odd terms to come to in modern times
I love New Jefree
It's so obnoxious to say YouTube is dead just because you aren't getting the views you used to lol now more average ppl like us are able to have a shot to even be seen! Like y'all still get 100,000+ upto million or more views.. Be grateful.
Hellloooo I'm here....watching YT 😅😅😅
Jeffree has overcome so much throughout these last 5 years. Even though it's sad hearing him say Youtube is dead, I'm so happy for him that he's finding other business avenues. He looks so happy in Wyoming. He’s beginning to find his own peace and realize that materialistic things don't matter as much as people portray. Jeffree is so smart, he'll be successful no matter where he plants himself. We love you both, loving this series so far, Shane!!!
jeffery star is worse then the devil
Jeffree became so humble. I really love this side of him. Some of us still watch YouTube. If YouTube would stop changing algorithm everyday then the creator wont feel that YouTube is dead.
It is true that nobody is watching YouTube as much anymore and it sucks. Like this video, is #1 trending right now, with just shy of a million views. I know Shane probably blames being cancelled for the decrease in views but this video is #1 on trending, it's just views are down. I hope people come back to YouTube, I will always prefer it over TikTok
Tik tok is a scrolling doom.
❤️❤️❤️
I know YouTube isn't where it used to be, but it's better than what's happening to Twitter right now. Currently, I'm streaming on Twitch and I know there's a beauty/makeup platform on Twitch that may be worth checking out. But you can do more reviews on it live and also have VOD available for a time for those who want to rewatch or watch it for the first time. I still feel that getting Jeffree Star approved review videos is still a good thing. You don't have to do it a lot, but it would be something for those who want to know about new products. There's also a chat section to just talk with others, there's space for all sorts of things and I think you might have fun with it.  Times are changing, democracy is being undermined and there's a real threat that we could lose it in this next election cycle. This could be the last time we have a real election... so the world is a terrifying place right now. So being able to escape into a Twitch stream, a game, a movie, a book or a video is mental health right now. To remove the terror for just a little while so we can breathe.  You actually achieved the very thing I often would comment about. I wanted a windfall of cash, just to be able to pay off my debts, get a property to put a home on so I could have my sanctuary. So I could have peace of mind & be able to breathe. I'm going to be 60 in mid-Jan. I've barely 2k saved up, I'm drowning in $20k debt (made worse by having to use credit cards to survive COVID & not end up homeless like so many did) I make less than $850/month and if it wasn't for family/friends I wouldn't be able to afford living here. That's why I want my own 5acres (minimum for family farm with offers a lot of perks - like having a pond stocked with fish, having any native trees sent to you from the Arbor Assoc. & a lot more for a small farm.) But I've still a ways to go to reach min. of $5k for down payment or $10-15k to buy a property. Was looking into VA since I love the mountains & used to live there... cried when I had to move away over 25 years ago. I want to go back... There's an adorable business there called Two Witches Brewery and I so want to go see it! The vibe there is similar to the one in Savannah, GA - which is one of the most haunted places in the world & they embrace it. Garden of Good & Evil was filmed there too.  I'm just so happy you've found your sanctuary too.
"YouTube sucks" 😂 it's so true though! It's not what it used to be. I'll miss the Jeffree videos so much, I love him and his products. But I agree, people don't even post here as much anymore because it's fizzling out.
You have no idea how much this meant to me.  I love you all SO MUCH!!  I have missed all of the shenanigans. I love you, this legit hit me harder than my Prozac lol. Pure happiness 🎉😂❤
Please release the palette!
Honestly, Jeffree just looks like he is enjoying his life SO much more than he EVER did in LA. Watching him playing with the Hummer and that super fast speed mode was like watching a kid on a rollercoaster for the first time. He is just genuinely enjoying life now and it's so refreshing!
The car 🚘 😩 so beautiful
I watch Youtube every day. So for me it's not dead.
Yeah I feel like the generation, Who watched YT, like Jenna, Shane, Simply Nailogical etc... Is like Getting Jobs And starting families... Still makes me very very sad, what Jeffree Said... But it is True..  "wish ws could turn Back time to the good old dayyys"
I hope this will finally be your comeback. People need to get over themselves
I loved this so much i watched it twice ✌️
I still use YouTube for entertainment 😭
love 💕
LMAO just 'cause nobody's watching Jeffree anymore doesn't mean YouTube's dead. TickTok isn't a *thing* where I live and I assure you, YouTube's thriving.
I can't with the new camera guy.........
“No one watches YouTube anymore”   Me who uses YouTube as TV- 🤡
I CARE ABOUT YOUTUBE! LOVE YOU GUYS!!!
Psh, if you insist! I mean, true, but if you don't think youtube falls under streaming, (well, i'm mean, i guess technically, streaming is a separate thing on youtube (more live) but still!?!?!) If you insist!? I've got plenty of cartoon's to catch up on And (kinda) Binge anyway!!!! so, i mean, the only you youtuber i (kinda) really follow/ watch, (maybe) binge, and (might) catch up on is PewDiePie!?! so if you insist, then i'll be Done, your just casual at most, and fizzled out (like jeffrey said) at minimum, anyway!!!!!!!!!
Nooo please don't quit youtube!!!
Shane and Ryland just need to start an alpaca ranch next door to Jeffree. Jeffree can be their baby’s Auntie.
YouTube IS my Netflix, my cable, etc.  I get that I’m a millennial and not a gen Z kid and that can make a big difference in content consumption… but instead of watching Netflix series after Netflix series or paying for cable television I truly enjoy watching the creators I am subscribed to in my free time. I go on tik tok every once in a while but not often, at all.  Obviously creators should stop if it’s not sparking joy but I want them to know a lot of us do still watch. Daily. 😔
OMG, I cannot get enough of this series. Incredible like the last series!!
I’m going to miss Jeffree’s videos so much if he stops YouTube. I’M still clicking. I’M still coming home from work every day and getting excited to see he’s posted. Idk. I’m so so happy that he’s been so happy and free the past few years. If he wants to quit YouTube because he’s bored or it just doesn’t make him happy anymore that’s completely understandable and I’d encourage it. But Jeffree if you’re stopping because you don’t think we’re still here to love you and support you that’s just not true. Fuck the numbers, right?.. I mean maybe the people who are still watching are the ones who’ve been obsessed with you all this time. You made me love makeup and encouraged me to try new colors and have fun with it instead of wearing it all through high school because I whole heartedly believed I was ugly without it. You mean the world to me. You and Shane both do. I love you guys. I’ll be here for the next vid and the next one and the next 💕  I’m finally out of college now and money’s tight.. I haven’t been able to buy the last couple palettes but I’m setting money aside for them out of every paycheck cause I’m just so obsessed. I really wouldn’t be surprised if there were a bunch of other fans out there in my same situation. Every product I’ve bought from you has brought me so much joy. SUPER excited for Psychedelic Circus and will be buying the palette and maybe a liquid eyeshadow or two.. hoping to spook my coworkers with an obscenely bright look on Monday. I work at a bank. Wish me luck LMAO 🥰💕❤
I’m so glad that Shane and Jeffree are both living their good and happy lives now. It’s so exciting for me to see that because I grew up watching both of them struggle and now they are flourishing in their own lives and it’s pretty great! So happy for you guys!
Did he change the title?
My thing is I don’t think people understand how much Jeffrey has grown I was watching when I was like 10 Jeffrey sing a song called c u n t so you know the new age kids can be appalled  at whatever they want but there’s always gonna be loyal Jeffree star followers and I will always be one of them I love you Shane and you know sometimes the loudest comments are the crybaby comments about hating on just anything and I hope you know you’re stronger than all that you know you guys really shine
JEFFREY WITH A 9 🤩 AN THE CONFIDENCE WHILE HANDLING IT IS EVERYTHING!!❤❤❤❤
There are people who still care about YouTube. I just think Jeffree has rubbed some people the wrong way for a plethora of reasons. Very disappointed with him saying nobody cares, there are people who still care… are those people not enough because you’re not getting millions of views? I thought you didn’t care about the money anymore? Hm.
I’m surprised Jeffree Star hasn’t had the electric Hummer custom painted pink. I really like his pink Tesla. I laughed when Jefree brought out his gun. LOL Shane was so scared. I also love the pink Lamborghini.
I’m currently a senior in high school, but last year for my dual English class I had to write a 5 page essay on who had a big impact on my life and is the reason I am who I am today.  I wrote my whole paper on Shane Dawson. Paragraph by paragraph explaining how during my parent’s divorce in elementary school he was my comfort YouTuber, I would drop what I was doing during his upload time and watch him. Talk about how how him being so open on YouTube helped me develop as a person because he didn’t censor anything, he was real. I felt as if he was a big brother that was open with his mistakes and open about what he did to be successful. Not to mention I adapted his awkward humor.  Hearing Jeffery talk about YouTube being dead really hit something in me, because I’ve noticed that YouTube had been dying too. I didn’t want to think about it but now that someone said it, I just hope that Shane continues with his content and podcast with his brother, Ryland, and Chris.  I love your content Shane, thank you for being the reason many people smile 🤍
Jeffrey - "It really can't be that shocking"  *me literally yelling "NOOOO!! WHYYYYYY!!*
I really don't think Youtube is dying. It's some of the big Youtubers' channels that are dying but that doesn't mean the platform is at risk or anything. Plenty of other channels are doing better than ever frankly. People being over Shane and Jefree's drama doesn't mean the whole platform is dead lol.
youtube is my most used app 😭
lmao everytime Shane posts a video and changes the title I get excited that it's a whole diff video 😂
I would love to see Jeffree’s journey with the Yaks and his farm business :(
What an evolution for Jeffree Star!
just because youtube is dead for jeffery doesn’t mean it’s done for everybody
Literally I watch YouTube everyday I’m so sad 😭 I hate tik tok that shit is another platform to watch the same damn videos over and over again but with different ppl like it’s not impressive I’m so sad not another Jenna marbles that women took all sadness away when watching her videos
I love you guys ❤️ it sucks hearing that no one cares about YouTube. I’m still watching my faves and I’ve been for 14/15 years now. I can’t wait to watch the next video! Love y’all
Vegan make up to farm animals to slaughter 😳😢 well that sucks
oh no please Jeffrey don't it's really breaking my heart how my favorite YouTubers are now leaving.. youtube isn't the same anymore
I don’t want it to end 😢 Shane!!! Never stop YouTube! We need you!
i know people have said this enough but ill just add on to the fact that Shane and Jeffree is such a funny duo i actually cant. I love Jeffrees randomness <3
I’m confused by this alil  because even  though I have a lot of streaming f services I still watch YouTube a good chunk of the day  I don’t think it’s dead I think the algorithm messes with a lot and causes problems.  I think makeup is on the slow side and maybe that’s why.
YouTube isn't dead! Just different content is getting attention it isn't all about the beauty and drama anymore. I personally love the anti mlm content and lawtube side of YouTube
YouTube is the only source of entertainment videos that I watch. I don’t watch Netflix, Disney, TikTok etc. YouTube better not ever fizzle out because I love watching everyone’s YouTube videos over the past decade 😢 But whatever feels right in your heart is what you should do ❤️ Support you guys always. Jeffree was part of my scene stage in my teens listening to his music LOL I’ll never forget him and I enjoy seeing his growth. Same with Shane’s growth over the years I feel like I grew with you guys. LOTS OF LOVE 💕 I’ll continue to support you guys with whatever your journey holds xo
Is Jeffree completely done? Because...I desperately want a Wyoming ghost hunting series with y'all now 🤣🤣🤣
I watch YouTube DAILY!!! I LIVE for YouTube
I still love YouTube and watch it daily! I’m 30 and refuse to download Tick Tock.. I just still love the long content and feeling connected to who I’m watching and have been watching for years.  Also the plane ride reminds me of an old Shane video when he had his pills with him 😂❤️.  These series make me happy and I love Jeffree’s old make up videos too. I hope you guys never stop
Not true content creators on tt is being shadow banned every 3 days
love u jeffree but YOUTUBE IS NOT DEAD.
I still watch and still care but I get it...
Life was better when Shane was canceled and wasn't making content
The sad thing is that I've been coming back to YouTube lately because I've been exhausted from every other kind of entertainment and have just been missing old day YT. Hearing Jeffree say that he's leaving actually does kind of hurt 🥺
Damn Jeffree... Some of us still watch.  😔 But I support your decision and will always love you.
Love seeing jefree like this ❤
Shane . If you do not release this palette everyone is gonna DIE ..... OF HEARTBREAK. Let that sink in........ the choice is yours
🫶🏽🥰🇩🇰
I CARE!!!!!!! Just because you don’t have the same views during a scandal, doesn’t mean you don’t have a loyal fan base that watches every single video. My daughter and I watch Jeffree’s videos, and not at the same time!
I actually cried at the end of this video. I feel like i've grown up with Jeffree and Shane....
I find it very strange that a makeup seller is also selling...yak meat
no no no jeffrey i still watch and rewatch your videos. please dont leave.
YouTube is my favorite place to watch. So it makes me sad that Jeffree thinks no one cares 😭 Shane and his videos have gotten me through so much. And I would be so sad if he quit too..
love this! but hope to see some of the podcast soon i miss it
I almost exclusively watch YouTube now. Constant new content from creators I love. It is sad to see how few views videos get now compared to years ago.
Don't Go Jeffree 💔
Wow ok. I watch YouTube like daily. For school, enjoyment, and for entertainment when I’m not near a TV. I won’t lie I don’t watch Jeffrey’s stuff because I’m not that into makeup.. but I watch so many other channels. So I do understand what he is saying but I don’t think it’s dying for everyone. He has put grown it and good for him! But not everyone else has something to fall back on to with out YouTube like Jeffrey does.
Hallo
I still watch YouTube everyday lol
“As long as you don’t use they and them you’ll be fine” 😂😂 as a they/them I fucking feeeeel that hahaha omfg
I only watch YouTube lol. YouTube isn’t dead. They’re even turning into the gaming steaming play form to go to now. Twitch is dying not YouTube. TT will fizzle out and YouTube will still be here.
After the "scandal" dosent feel the same watching your videos, its not that  exciting or funny anymore but good for you.
I’m on YouTube more than Netflix!  Literally every single day on YouTube
I’m not trying to bash anyone but we’ve seen all of this before….. only last 5 min are new
23:49 is downtown Athens, Georgia
Noooo what??? Jefree is quiting youtube??? Damn he's the only makeup account I watch :(((
piggish behavior
Lmao YouTube is not dead, they killed themselves with their trash personalities.
Please, please don’t leave YouTube…it’s my go to, it’s how I unwind from MY life. You all mean the world to me…to us💕 Truly
Awesome video!!! Loved everything about it and I even cried to see you and Jeffrey together ❤️ can’t wait for the continuance!!
55min15 passed like 20 secondes.  I feel where is Jeffree now, physically and mentally : too busy living his life to care about others’ problems. ❤
I love that they have both grown so much and become so much happier
Number one on trending! 🖤🖤
Bro this video is making no sense so far 3:14
I still watch YouTube daily.
🔥🔥I am a YouTuber 🔥 🔥 💖💖Support me this is my second channel 💖💖 https://youtube.com/shorts/fZAmFa7Rt7A?feature=share
YouTube is alive and well. It's just that nobody watches Jeffery anymore.
https://youtube.com/shorts/fZAmFa7Rt7A?feature=share
My favorite thing about this is how much you all are laughing!!! Compared to anything Jeffree Star has been in. All of you hanging out you ALL seem so happy. What a difference. And a joy to see🥰 friends are so important.
I watch You Tube all the time Jeffree. Wow. But I get where he’s coming from, from his standpoint. He’s not making any coin from it. I’m sad about it though.
Lol a million views a video "no one watches any more" 🤣🤣🤣
LOVE YOU SHANE!!!
Little late but by the end o was like oh shit ok not what I thought but I really loved it of course should of know but I’m very excited now!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
So this is just basically saying jeffree is grown up and mature now.
I'm so happy for Jeffrey and how he is handling things with such maturity. I have been watching you Shane for years now and honestly it all started when you first collabed with him. I absolutely loved and still love the energy Jeffrey puts off and especially when the famous duo are together it is such a joy ride. it's so crazy that one week ago today I decided to rewatch the conspiracy pallet series, and then we get another series like it. it's so crazy how much growth you guys have been through and even though Jeffrey will be quitting YouTube, I know that I along with many many others will still enjoy watching and rewatching his videos along with yours! we all love you guys!
Hey Shane can you please put the music a little quieter when you edit ? Finding it hard to understand what you’re saying sometimes 😅
Okay but this made me sad YouTube is my only app i use and have used since I was a kid I’m 24 now
My heart breaks. All of us who grew up with you guys 😢 ugh you were comfort
All I want is Jeffrey happiness
Shane, please make more scary videos with Jeffree!!
Why the silencer? 😳
Here comes Shane to pull me out of my PP depression with his art! Your videos are like an old friend who’s always there when you need them! Love the new series, still love all the content on both channels, And love love love the new podcast! Missed you! ❤️
Jefree is seriously attractive bare face 😍
I was watching both you when I was pregnant with my youngest and now she's going 3 and seeing you both again in a YT series is THE BEEEEST! I love the energy you both have in one screen. ❤️❤️
I still love YouTube. But I tend to not come back to people who only upload to sell something or only post twice a year. I like weekly or daily uploads. I still watch some people daily.
COME THROUGH BUILDING THE SUSPENSE!
I’m actually fucking crying….
Dude jeffree is so funny 😅
I'm loving this so much I'm watching it twice!!! Thank you Shane for giving us a peek into yalls life. You're so genuine. Youre level of happiness is contagious. Thank you Thank you thank you.!!!!!
Dude jeffree is so funny 😅
All my favs are leaving an left YouTube I guess I have to open a TikTok now selling out for sure 👽
Wtf
Jeffree really had his own hallmark movie story arc
It’s true though youtube is not it anymore.
No matter what Jeffree chooses to do we will be by his side💗 please don’t stop the Shane and Jeffree Collabs
I am still on Youtube, anyone else?  Im also on tiktok, what tiktok doesnt have is long videos, youtube can provide that <3
Nooo Jeffrey was the only person I trusted with reviews because I know he is going to say if he doesn’t like something not like other people that if they get pay they give it a good review even if they don’t like it
Jeffree looks so healthy and happy. 💕
Please guys don’t quit I faithfully watch all of your content am not a fan of ticktock as much as seeing your you tube videos 😢
Weird, I didn't get a notification for this. I got the notification for the first one immediately but not this one lol weird
I love their friendship. It’s unbreakable. Also, JS is such an amazing businessman fr. This man will find ways to make money no matter what. Hustler fr
"Youtube is dead, no one watches it anymore" I watch it everyday! More than streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu, I find YouTube to be more entertaining and real. I enjoy content like this rather than a scripted series on Netflix. I am so sad about jeffery quitting YouTube!!!
PLEASE DO A PARANORMAL EPISODE IN WYHOMING!!!!
I love this side of Jeffree (and Shane). This whole video built me up I got so excited about the future of Jeffree only to get shattered in the end 😭💔 Can't wait for part 3
De edeting is soooo good, damm
could have a yak pallete with colours of the yaks
So happy for Jeffrey!!! He seems genuinely happy & at peace. I’ve deleted all social media and I highly recommend it. My mental health was suffering from the toxic environment of Facebook, Instagram & TikTok. I am so much happier now & have time to get things done
I'm here for this
I still love YouTube
I’m honestly so proud of Jeffrey. He had it all and realized life is more about finding who you are & all those materialistic things weren’t who he truly was. I’m so happy to see him so happy. ❤
no one watches youtube anymore... i must have missed the memo whoops
Gosh, I'm literally on Youtube all the time, t's probably my most used app!
Wow this is amazing he is so much more grounded.
Rusland so cringe at Jeff i can feel the pain
I think that might be a US thing because everyone i know including myself watch youtube way more than any other platform.
Ryan, please stop trying so hard. This isn’t high school. Ick.
No matter what takes over YouTube like tik tok and Disney plus and much more, I’d still watch Jeffree until I die. I know we all have our past but to see how much he has changed mentally and physically is jus moving. Shane’s and his relationship is so special and one of a kind. Atleast it be nice to see jeffree  in Shane’s videos once in awhile. Jeffree has inspired a lot of people. To change your life around for better and for yourself isn’t easy. Everyone wants to live this certain LA/Barbie lifestyle that jus isn’t what it seems behind closed doors. It means a lot to all of us for all the great work and content Jeffree gave us❤️ I really do wish him the best and glad to see the doggy angels happy as well. I’m just really happy to see him happy. Spread kindness and do what you love 💗
I still watch YouTube…….
I always loved Shane but he vocally apologize for his past actions.. he beat himself up for what lot of people kept pushing him .. as someone who suffers from depression anxiety I can see he is trying hard ❤
DO NOT QUIT YOUTUBE IM SORRY BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE WE LOST TOO MANY AND THIS SHIT HELPS US GET THROUGH LIFE
He looks free!
I think we can all say that there’s still a certain crowd like me who goes out and watches YouTube for entertainment almost everyday. I watch everything from gaming to Shane’s conspiracy pallet series and more. Especially during the pandemic I was on here a shit tone. If Jeffree is retiring then I hope his retirement is good he’s been on YouTube for 20 fucking years. There’ll always be the core audience that’ll watch you guys.
I dont think youtube is dead, I think the beauty community over did itself. There was so much product being pushed that buyers got overwhelmed and stopped caring. A lot of beauty I fluencers have moved on to other things like lifestyle, podcasts, and other interests to try and grow with their subscribers.
I absolutely love the energy and positivity that Shane's presence brings for Jeffree. You can see him become happier when Shane and Ryland are around 🥰 on a side note yall should definately make a series where Jeffree teaches Shane and Ryland about 2A and how to shoot  😂
YouTube isn’t dead. People may be tired of it but there still isn’t a better app to use. Dead is like vine. And YouTube may be slowly dying but it ain’t dead and probably won’t be for a while. Also people just got tired of Jeffrey’s bs so they stopping clicking on his videos. But just because you aren’t doing well doesn’t mean other people aren’t. But this is basic narcissistic behavior from Jeffrey. If they aren’t doing well then nobody could possibly be doing well.
“ it’s a little gay” my whole body dropped the floor 😂😂😂😂
I am soooo happy to see Shane’s channel continue to thrive no matter what state the world is in. 💗
JEFFREE I LOVE YOU BUT LETS NOT CONVINCE SHANE AND RYLAND TO STOP MAKING VIDEOS. ILL DIE.
This is such manipulation.  Jeffrey wants to say YouTube is dead instead of the fact that his actions is why he doesn't get 10 million views anymore. I stopped watching him because I was sick of the drama. I mean great he isn't apart of it anymore but its a little to late, ya know.  I still come on YouTube daily. It's not dead at all.
This clown still posts?
I’m glad. I love your new life! Congratulations! TikTok is ridiculous. But you gotta do what you gotta do with that platform. All good things come to an end.
Jeffree’s not wrong. Both him and Shane were getting 20m vies on their videos for a long time and now they’re only getting like 1m. YouTube is dying because of TikTok. These new generations don’t have the attention span to watch full videos.
So he's quiting YouTube bc he fell off cause idk about y'all but I'm on here everyday watching shit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I kinda side with the YouTube dying. I am only on here for this episode. A lot of my friends grew up on YouTube but it is getting MySpaced
Jeffree looks amazin! Skin is flawless 😍
Shane don’t listen to the YouTube is dead thing! I don’t watch regular tv! I only watch YouTube and Netflix period!
Poor Jeff going broke and needs simps to bail him out 👎
nostalgic  af
This whole series better not be leading up to Shane saying he is leave YouTube too because so help lord
Jeffree is honestly so funny 🤣
"We'll get to it later...😄 no but seriously, this is bomb Shane! Very interesting, I wanna see mooooore!!! Great job! 👏 I'm so glad Jeffree found peace and he's finally happy. PS: I still watch YouTube 😄
Kinda pissed Jeffree said no one watches YouTube. Out of all the streaming platforms I have, I click YouTube before any of the other ones. I get it, but don't. 🥺
Jeffree looks so good in this video! He is glowing. The tanned skin. The more masculine features. I’m loving it!
I love you guys but calling Texas stupid is offensive. I'm from Texas and I'm far from stupid, just because we talk a certain way.
you could just do it for fun maybe?? Idk im just so sad that all these youtubers that i grew up with are all slowly leaving…but i hope that everyone including jeffree find true happiness and satisfaction because the time that we did have together was very precious to us fans.
We're here because we all watch YouTube daily...
Even if you still hold a negative opinion on these two, you can't deny that they actually have matured after all that has happened to them. Like ffs, you literally can't ask more from someone... You know?
Very good episode ❤
I don’t understand how Jeffree can be happy in Casper Wyoming. I live here and I HATE IT
I don't undestand Jeffree tho, youtube is absolutely not dead. He gets 1.3M views per video Still, and even if thats a lot less than 20M or whatever, that is absolutely not dead and nothing to sneeze at.
If Shane feels like he has to clarify in every video that the shit he's doing "wasn't planned" and doesn't want people to think it is, he planned it, for the record. He says this every single time without fail. He's always planning and using you.
Meanwhile I can’t even get a subscriber to save my life 😂
This is all manipulation.
I appreciate the camera clip/angles that Chris does!
Shane is me when I fly. I hate it
The only videos I watch on YouTube or Shane Rylan Jeffree star and graveyard girl sometimes with her but you guys are the main reason I am on YouTube no one else I care to watch
Omg noooo, jeffree 😢 we do care and we do still watch
I realize watching and commenting on this videos adds to the problem, but I hope you all know Jeffree is saying that shit to get you to go watch his videos. He still regularly gets 1-2+ million views per video. He's bullshitting and throwing a tantrum because the beauty industry stopped peaking when pandemic hit and he's not getting 10+ million views for doing nothing he hasn't done before, so he's being dramatic in public again to get his fans to ramp him up. Don't fall for it.
I WATCH YOUTUBE FOR ENJOYMENT !! :/
this video just made me realize how much i’ve missed this duo, i’m happy you two are filming again 😭
These videos are such a mess it’s hard to follow
What in the hell is that gun safety etiquette?
Awe my two favorite YouTubers just a few hours from me 😱🫶🫶 hope you enjoyed Wyoming
As a person who is always on YouTube I don't agree with that...I just think people have changed and may have moved onto other things than make up....don't quit Shane 🙏
Jeffree i always watch i love his wittyness which is great. Please dont retire and hang your bathrob on. You give me so much laughter , lightness, honesty which is bold and brave.
This is the first time I’ve watched a video with jeffree in and genuinely liked him. He seems so much more grounded and genuine and not so intimidating, I really think he’s changed for the better. Not that I disliked him before, I just found his whole persona so annoying and kind of scary.  Also I don’t think youtube is dying, I think there’s just less creators now or too many creators making big videos or series so therefore they’re putting more work in and spending longer to perfect it rather than putting out shorter sillier videos more frequently. I go on YouTube every single day and most of the time can’t find absolutely anything to watch as the people I watch don’t upload often.
I watched one of raw beauty kristi’s videos awhile back and she said basically it comes and goes and right now people want the short quick videos but eventually we’ll want those long videos again with more info and detail. I think she’s right. I don’t think YouTube is dead forever but I do think right now it’s not as popular. But watching this makes me sad so for many reasons. I think back to how it was when they launched conspiracy and everything was so different. I was different. I have not watched YouTube as much as I used to. And I haven’t followed Shane and Jeffree like I used to and I feel so guilty because I genuinely think they’re good people.
Jeffrey with the zapper and saying " yeah things change"  I died.
Jeffree is right. This series is the first time I've watched YouTube in a while other than a collection reveal or the occasional Jaclyn video in years. Tiktok has changed our attention spans to 60 seconds. Anything longer than that and I'm bored.
I am so …wow
I so so strongly disagree with “Youtube is dead”. 😢 this video made me sad for real
I've been watching videos on YT for a long time, pretty much since the site launched. I def started watching more during the pandemic... not more beauty videos I'll admit but more YT content in general for sure. Sad to see more of my faves stepping away/back.
What’s the intro music .? Anyone knows
Sorry but Jeffrey is not correct in saying that YouTube is dying. It's larger than ever, as the 3rd most used app in the world, it continuously grows every month, every week. YouTube will never not be around, it might evolve, it might change, but it will likely outlive everything else because videos will always be a staple in human culture and as long as they keep access to it free, they will have a prime spot. Jeffrey was cancelled, that's why nobody is clicking *his* videos. That's not a reflection on YouTube as a whole.
I LOVE YOUTUBE :( for years this has be one my comfort zone I love watching at night before to bed , youtube is still a big part of many of us fan
I literally watch YouTube every single day lol
Oh noo are we going to see shane and jeffree ghost hunting?? Holy shitt unexpected comboo
I like this new Jeffrey.
You are not wasting your time making videos Shane. I will never stop watching them!
YouTube is my go-to!! That is so sad to hear Jeffrey say that :( I still watch him!!
I watch YouTube for true crime and haunting documentaries, but I still watch Shane, Ryland, Morgan and Jeffree….sad to think of it being gone
Honestly love this for them. I can’t imagine what it feels like to be cancelled. Having that many people hate your guts could literally destroy a person. I think they’ve learned and grown because of their mistakes. I’m here for the personal growth. A whole new era. People really act like they haven’t done something that would get them “cancelled” or hated on it they were famous.
I still watch YouTube 🙁
I love you Shane but this time the series is a bit boring so stretched almost an hour just to say travelled and met Jeffery and nothing excited happened, the camera man is laughing loudly into our ears not really capturing the best moments 🫤
I'm happy to see the arcade made the move :)
so glad Chris gets to come on this adventure with them this time it clearly makes him so happy <3
ngl i dont get the point of this series shane.. WHATS THE PLOT??? anyways still super good
I don't know what would happen to me and my mental health if youtube dies.. Youtube has saved me so many times and has been an escape for me from life.. new social media sucks.. Ugh 💔
YouTube is far from dead..
Jeffree is so right at the end! Quality videos that people put effort into don't get views anymore. The only videos that get views are less than 15 minutes and click batey.
We love our youtube daddies
*me a student at UGA, getting very confused at **23:49** when there was suddenly footage of downtown Athens being shown in a Shane Dawson video*
#wheresandrew
I am living for this. I would never be anything close to what Jeffree has accomplished but It's a dream of mine to own land and animals like that. Knowing the full story and how his self care brought him to this point is an amazing life story. Hate him if you want, but I'm into it. 👑👑
BeeBee Gunn didn’t give y’all permission to use the clip of her crying..
k but when jeffree said nobody watches him anymore 🥺 i’m like i get that enjoyment and sense of happiness watching him post on youtube UGH PLEASE DONT HANG UP THE BOOTS
So happy to see JS finally looking truly happy and it looks like he’s finding his true self out there ❤ YT is not dead tho, it’s just not the “it girl” anymore is all… instant gratification transformed YT vids into TT but a large population of us still come to YT to enjoy longer videos.. TT people are making accounts on YT now so it can’t be dead if they’re reverting back to it for longer content
Well... I think the YouTube community is still ok. Considering the millions of views on recent videos. But maybe it's just not for Jefree.
Omg I'm so heartbroken 💔
😭😭😭😭😓😓😓
Was this whole thing a Hummer Ad?
Anyone notice the 89mph on Jeffree's road? Lol still living on the edge in the middle of nowhere. Love him omg 🖤🤣
Really missed your videos, Shane🖤 I can't even explain the feeling I get while watching🖤
I’m so so so hoping they do a haunted series with jeffree it would be legendary
GHOST HUNTING SHANE X JEFFREE
That is so not true. I watch youtube for every reason every ocassion
His world includes lots of An*l Prolapse and Leakage.... Yuck!
Gut punch is an understatement.... don't leave us Jeffree!! 😢
every time shane posts a video it feels like a fever dream😭
People can say what they want but everyone grows and changes. I'm living for seeing you two again. Also, Shane, you're still so fucking hilarious, I can't lol
I promised myself I would be a Fox human on the internet anymore but like… how is this even a series. Imagine playing a victim after being held accountable for blatant racism
It hurt my heart hearing Jeffree say he’s leaving and that no one cares about YouTube anymore. I literally come on here every day and see if Ryland, Shane or Jeffree has updated their pages. If not, I rewatch old videos/series. I literally love them and their dynamic
Jeffree: I can't believe we're actually going to show our baby. To feel so excited about something and then to have such disappointment has been a lot.  My Parents: SAME!
I think what’s most beautiful about this video is the sincerity behind it. COVID ruined SO much, & life’s unexpected moments can take a toll on us BUT gives an opportunity to choose ourselves all over again. This is beautiful, Shane! I love you guys!
I was SO not ready. The ending of an era, the turning of a page. I hope this next chapter for Jeffree is full of many more smiles than tears!
Not gonna lie, as soon as Shane and Jeffree reunited I started to cry. A wave of emotions came over me and i remembered the old YouTube. How I miss the old content and Jenna too. So once Jeffree said he was quitting YouTube like Jenna it truly hit me. I miss the old days 😢
It’s the gun on the counter for me
YouTube is NOT dead. This is literally the only social media-type app I use. I get my news, entertainment, and everything else here. I really hope all my favorite creators don't start leaving 😭 hearing Jeffree say no one cares very literally broke my heart. YouTube is my happy place. That may sound stupid to some people but there are a lot of channels that have been a constant thing I could count on when I needed stability and distraction from life, and Shane and Jeffree are a couple of them. I don't really understand how he can say no one cares when he still has TONS of loyal viewers that want his long-form content like his reviews to come back. Definitely walking away from this video feeling a little sad. He said two more videos, and he's done, so maybe he's changed his mind since he's put out more than that since this was filmed.
I used to watch Jeffrey, these days I watch Rylan, Morgan and a couple of other you tube channels... I was excited for this combo of Shane and Jeffrey too, I am here for it, I love Jeffrey's humour, living 😍
Seeing how much Jeffree cares about you guys is so heartwarming I don’t know why but I got emotional when he grabbed the luggage and was talking about picking you up in the hummer!!!
I gotta say though if Jeffree really does quit YouTube I’ll be sad but I do respect it because it shows that he really has grown and doesn’t care about being the centre of attention anymore. And I really respect him for his new life that is much more down to earth and relatable.
Shane don't you stop YouTube
Dont you ever leave us Shane, literally watch you every day 🥹🥹🥹🥹😩❤️‍🔥
Okay no I'm definitely a Youtube gal. I watch video's daily and I LOVE yours en Jeffrey's content! Youtube is still at the top of my list when I want to watch something fun.
Jeffrey and Shane need to do this every 2 to 3 years he's serious be on points and it's better not to have them every year but you know in a span of three four years like that I love it it's a lot of catch up on a lot of wholesome moments a lot of sad exciting it's emotional and all that
i know jacksepticeye feels the same way as jeffree cuz he’s been backing away from youtube too. it’s hard to do youtube nowadays because of the environment and it’s draining
Why does this bring me so much joy ❤️
YouTube isn't dead😭 if Shane ever quits YouTube I will forever be sad😭
Growing up with Jeffree since I was a teen in 2003 and Shane for he last decade, I'm so fucking proud of their transitions into the even more beautiful humans they've become. 😭💜😭
#1 on Trending!!! Love you Shane and the whole fam.
YouTube may not be as poppin as it used to be but there are a lot of loyal YouTube lovers like me who’s literally been following Shane, Jeffree and the other OG’s since their first videos when I was a kid. It literally doesn’t matter where or what they’re doing, I’ll always care and follow. My dream is to meet them. They meant more to me than any Hollywood stars. I’ve grown with them and I’m 25 now. Thank you for continuing Shane. You mean so much more to me than you could ever know. There’s times I’ve had the worst anxiety attacks and crying my eyes out and Shane and Jeffree never failed to lift my spirit.  I know you’re done Jeffree and it’s totally understandable. You’ve accomplished so freaking much and you’ve had to deal with so much hate and cruelty from people. I’m thankful you’ve stuck around this long. I’d ask you to reconsider out of selfishness but you deserve complete, total peace and happiness. Love you ❤ thank you, truly.
Was looking forward to this reunion guys beautiful friendship
The Yak Ranch Star Arcade (I call them "Starcade") looks amazing, the yak ranch as a whole looks amazing. There's so much for words to even say.
Jeffery is just so hilarious 😭😭😭
About throw up ugh
I really hope that by Jeffery saying he is quitting YouTube doesn't mean shane and Ryland are going to quit. I love all of your videos and they are the highlight of my day.  You guys got me through highschool, college and now my everyday life. Please don't stop creating  🙏
I will always love Jeffrey, and I will never forget. I am so happy that Jeffrey found his happy place!!!
Omg the ending .. Please don’t quit YouTube ): this is my favorite app❤
I think the pandemic made us look into a different perspective. Shifting to more important things. Jeffree has a whole new maturity to him and I’m all for it 👏
Jeffree is honestly so funny, his quick one liners never flop.
Love love love
When Shane and Jeffree together, it's just... magical. It's fun, sweet, witty, sassy, cool and epic. Even if Jeffree quits youtube, I hope he still does a lot of collaboration with Shane. I suppose they don't expect it, but their friendship is everything.
Jeffree's tan is great
shane wearing gucci shoes to the gym is so ironically hilarious in so many ways
Dude I do watch youtube content to amuse and entertain. It has nothing to do with the applications of movies and series, for youtube videos that are of interest. If the videos are interesting, we'll see them!
Ok to see Shane and Jeffrey do a ghost hunt together would be litteraly everything lol Do it!!!
I’m so happy both Shane and Jeffree have moved on and found peace and happiness! I also hope both of them continue to do YouTube 😭 Even if there are less viewers, the real ones are STILL here and I hope that is enough!
Anyone else just loving this so much that it makes you wanna go back and watch the videos from 4 years ago??? Or is it just me ❤❤
I’m still watching 😭
going to miss jeffree so much😞💗but i’m so glad he’s doing what makes him happy. i’ll love him forever💗
Jeffree is literally a different person; relaxed and so sincere and so natural x
literally bout to cry because i love Shane and Jefree and I do still come to YouTube to feel happy. and tbh y'alls last series was my favorite and i feel like cancel culture ruined the good creators love to create.
Shane i love you and jeffree are amazing
YouTube is still my favourite app by far so I definitely disagree that is sucks and nobody watches it! I refuse to ever get tik tok and instagram isn’t my favourite because of how toxic it can be. Youtube is definitely still my favourite ❤❤
I watch YouTube everyday 🥴
Jeffree saying “YouTube sucks, no one’s watching” while Shane is filming a YouTube series was just classic Jeffree 😂 but I’m sad he’s leaving this app. I’ve never left, I’m still watching you guys, and will continue to do so! 🖤
This video made me cry at the end. I grew up listening to Jeffree and watching Shane and to hear Jeffree say no one watches made me feel scared that Shane and my other favorite people will disappear as well. You guys made my teen years up to being an adult.
I still care jeffree. I still watch you tube for u guys
I’m so sad rn   I still watch 😢❤️
#1 on YouTube trending I KNOW THATS RIGHT!!!!!!
I still watch videos for fun, so it would be sad if Jeffree realy dose quit youtube
Noooo Jeffrey don’t quit !!!!
We’ll I hope this proves to Jeffree that we care !
Lol not Shane realizing what he said when Chris calls him out for wearing Gucci shoes to work out 😂
My god Jeffree looks just so healthy and happy. I loved loved seeing him in his new chapter of life !! ♥️
I still watch YouTube. That’s what we’re watching now. Maybe beauty YouTube isn’t what it used to be but I still watch.
Jeffree and Shane are both so funny!
This is real as it gets. Love you guys, all of ya
hearing that jeffree said “youtube is dead” hurts my heart so bad. when shane stopped posting and went away for a while i watched EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of his old videos to help fill the void that he created by leaving. and now seeing him upload makes me happy. and i have to say , i’ve rewatched the jeffree series about 100 times now as if it was just uploaded 12 hours ago. you guys make an impact and i’m sure i’m not the only person who feels this way ❤. stay strong through the series , your fans love you!
I love Jeffree's new motto..."So?..." I'm sure it's quite freeing to have such a new and easy-going mindset. Good for you, Jeffree! Shane and Ryland: YOU guys better not follow suit!!! 🥰
I like how my mans just got a P90 laying on the counter. That is so funny.
Shane and Jeffree doing a paranormal investigation would be sooooo cool!
I’m going to cry. Don’t leave me y’all. You guys are the only ones I’ve ALWAYS watched and will continue to watch.
Jefferey is just so calm and relaxed.. it’s refreshing
Shane and Jeffree doing a paranormal investigation would be sooooo cool!
Okay but a haunted series exploring the paranormal hotspots in Wyoming with Jeffree would be sooooooooooooooooo goooooood
Honestly, I agree with jeffree. I still watch videos but it just seems like quality content isn't being recommended to viewers anymore. Many of my favorite YouTubers have slowed their posting because they feel screwed over by the algorithm.
I have no shame in admitting this, Jeffree and Shane, you guys are an inspiration. Watching you guys get out of the downward spiral and start thriving again and doing what you love doing is so peaceful and gives hope. Everyone has bad days, but it isn't the end after all. I am speechless and so happy you guys are doing this.
Jeffree living carefree and happy in the middle of nowhere is such a vibe. I love how relaxed and content everyone is now.
Actually teared up in the first 5 mins of this video. The jeffree x Shane era of YouTube was my favourite. I miss you both. I've lost Jenna Marbles and so many others already. Losing you guys would end YouTube for me. I know it's so #90skid #millennial but we
JEFREE LOOKS AMAZING!!! he’s not even wearing makeup and he looks flawless. his skin looks so glossy and heavenly like WOWWW
Love how Jeffree included Chris. Sometimes it's hard fitting in with mutual friends that already have history and are established. That was sweet how he would bring him in and make sure he felt a part of the conversations too.
We love you Jeffree🎉🎉🎉🎉
JEFFEREY LOOKS SO GOOD!!!
I love that Jeffrey is not afraid of outgrowing things, he is grateful for a moment but he’s also happy to sell things and let go. It’s so fucking healthy cause we are always changing and evolving, shit happens and we become different to who we were. I need to start letting go of things more.
When Jeffree said "just know it feels so right,  because it's with you"... I felt that.... you can tell how much they care and trust eachother. So sweet
I think hearing "YouTube is dead, no one watches it anymore" really hit me because I'm still on this app daily watching all my favs. As a fan, I already lost Jenna. I'm scared the rest are going to slowly disappear too and that's just depressing. I walked away from this video really sad, I'll admit.
Jeffree isn’t wrong. YouTube is dead. I’m only here to watch this, otherwise I never ever ever open my YouTube app. TikTok is definitely the new YouTube. I’m loving this Jeffree. The “so” Jeffree.
This series is everything I didn’t know I needed. Seeing you posting again Shane really makes me happy. I’m proud of all of you and I love every minute of this!❤
WAIT WHAT, NO NO NO Jeffree can't quit YouTube...😭 That's not true about NO ONE using YT, all I use is YT!
Loving every minute of this 😩🙌
Lol no code grower? Damn buffy
Oh great the two racists/pedos paired up
I disagree, I watch YouTube heavy and there is not a lot of content being made
Miss Jeffree with the trigger discipline lessons! *Snaps*  Also to really put the icing on the cake... This video is#1 trending and has something like 800k views. It's been dying for a while but my millennial self can't help but still watch 🤣
Maybe YouTube is dead but I still come back to watch Shane and Ryland. I hope you all stick around for awhile
yuck....no trees no mountains no lake  just windy planes
I really like jeffree in this episode. But he’s not quitting YouTube he just posted two days ago lol
Loved this!
I will admit I started watching Jeffrey because of Shane. So I think if they do a series together whether on Shane’s YT platform or Jeffrey’s YT platform I’ll definitely watch. Because when it’s both of them together, it’s just more entertaining. I’m not a fan of TikTok but I do see a lot of people prefer those short reel type videos, so I understand where Jeffrey’s coming from.
😢
“No one’s clicking anymore” Shane’s views say different…
I really hope he changes his mind and this doesn’t affect how Shane and Ryland think because I would totally be devastated if either of them are stopped, YouTube
so they're still friends?
I love ALLLLLLLL of this!!! I miss you all 😢. Living for this series… 🇨🇦❤️🇨🇦
Jeffree has a point about the state of YouTube, but there are still many of us where this remains our favorite video-viewing platform. I'll always click & I know there are a lot less of us around, but we will always be here to support y'all as long as you are enjoying the content you are putting out! I totally respect his choice to leave YT if he moves forward with it, but I'd encourage him to base that decision around his enjoyment, passion, and happiness (not on other peoples' opinions or lack of clicking) Sending so much love to you all <3
i love this series
Jeffree saying he's quitting youtube really brought me to tears. It feels like I know him personally and I'm gonna miss out on my friends life.
Maybe I’m a loser but I still really enjoy YouTube 😭🌈
i really hope Jeffrey doesn’t quit youtube yet! :((
I mean...... He pretty much quit YouTube a long time ago. He uploads a few times a year at most. Good for him, though. Get rid of what doesn't serve you anymore. I will miss him so much but I'm so happy and proud of how far he's come.
I love Jeffree Star my fellow Scorpio I just understand you and hilarious how shane reacted to how okay it is to have a gun in your hand to protect yourself cuz anywhere else you can't do it
I really needed this ❤️  Thank you
Next episode... Let's make our own YouTube.
I don’t care what anyone says I love these guys and always will
why is Shane always covered in dog hair
I fucking missed you guys 😭😂❤️
Shane reaction to EVERYTHING IS SO EPIC
I literally started to tear up hearing Jeffree is quiting YouTube but I'm also so happy that he is finally in a happy state of mind both of you! I still watch YouTube as much as possible between work and my kid but if that's what he wants to do fucking do it and live your life baby! Love you guys so much❤️❤️❤️😘
Please do some paranormal stuff in Wyoming! I’m so here for it! All and any of it 😁♥️
I had plans to move to Cheyenne but then covid happened & Jeffree moved there and now property values have SKYROCKETED
You should go into the cannabis industry by making infused jerky 😮‍💨
I don’t know if it’s YouTube or TikTok but I will follow these three anywhere! I come back to YouTube every week for Shane, Ryland, Lizzy, Morgan.. so it’s not dead to me.. at least not yet.
Seeing Jeffery doing so good on his Yak farm and living his best life is making my heart so happy ❤ I'm so glad everyone is doing good and moving forward with the things they're passionate about. Y'all are awesome, and we're all so very proud of you!
EXXAAAACCTTLLYY SHAAAANEEE GDVJNO PERIOD
🥹😩
I LOVE ur video’s ❤
JEFREE NOT THE SILENCER ATTACHED BITCH 😂
It literally feels like we have all just grown together and have all grown into these new versions of ourselves. I am so excited to see what the future holds for all of you. This is amazing.
So incredibly interesting!
Actually started crying at that announcement this can’t be real
Shane I hope that you don't put stock into that friendship.
When Jeffree entered in the airport so unexpected.. EPIC!
Jeffree looks and sounds amazing!  I am leaving this video very sad though.
I’m out. DONT BE ONE OF THOSE TAXODERMY ISNT OKAY ESPECIALLY SPECIAL ANIMALS THEIR BODIES NEED TO BREAK DOWN WITH THE EARTH FOR THEIR SPIRIT AND THEYRE THE COOLEST ANIMALS LIKE WHAAT NOO!! DONT U LIKE SPIRIT ANIMALS AND YOUD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL SO HOW WOULD U KNOW!! U took them from home bye bye peace
i love how ryland is dressed so extra because of jeffree i can tell he has his outfits for these occasions 😂❤
I love Jeffree and he's one of the only people I got on YouTube to see but he's right. If you compare views today to his older videos it's shocking. 43M views compared to not even 1M now.  I guess I'll have to finally get a tiktok :(
Incredible production, like always! Shane and Chris make an incredible team
Can’t wait for the next Episode!!! Really enjoyed watching this!!! ❤❤❤
😭
So happy you did this! You make me happy ❤
I’m fucking LIVING for the series
soon all my favorite youtubers are going to be gone :(
Jeffree i click on YouTube videos i just watch the content that makes me happy and does not feel fake. Which means I stopped watching your videos. I dont have the money to have a face full of injections, nor the will to. I dont like people flaunting their money nor do I like your persona anymore. I prefer to watch something closer to me. And after the whole drama and how you both handled it? I'm sorry but not interested. So maybe yes its time to quit YouTube and pursue other avenues. In any case I wish you the best in your new adventures.
YouTube is NOT dead, yes the algorithm is hurting creators but the app is used by millions, it’s not dead. YouTube is legit my tv essentially.
I'm so confused about Jeffree saying no one watches YouTube anymore. He still gets a million views on all his videos? :(
I think I would die if I saw shane at the airport I live in my piggy hoodies and carry the piggy purse or backpack all  the time.
I always remember the Shane x Jeffrey Era and remember how I loved every premier and I still feel like this with these 🥹🫶🏽
Don't give up Jeffree! There' more to YouTube than just beauty videos. I'm always on Youtube trying to find distractions, because I enjoy it more than Netflix or regular TV. I've never laughed so much while watching this and every series that Shane has made about you. Jeffree your personality mixed with Shane's brings me joy. I would definitely love a paranormal investigation with you guys together! PLease don't give up! xo
Jeffee's audience is mostly beauty community, I think that area changed, that's why he is not getting views. People still visit YouTube for the content like Shane produces.
47:14 the IT girl y’all silently chose to be without supporting
I just used your pallet the other day when I wanted a bolder look
I watch YouTube every day for hrs I'm gonna miss jeffree
Yaaasssz electric fly swat also u won’t die without killing yaks.
Jeffree says nobody watching YouTube anymore or clicking on the videos but literally every single one of his videos has at least 1M views or MORE. What does he mean nobody’s watching or clicking. There are millions of people still watching , me being one of those million lol……….I’m so confused 🫤
Next one now please
I don't know. I didn't see the purpose of this video. Instead of making fun of being canceled how about a real honest talk about why you were canceled and what have you actually learned from it. The joking of being canceled I find to be insincere.
Jeffree & Shane’s videos are my absolute fav. You two together are just fun to watch. The vulnerability, the authenticity, laughs, etc.
All my favorite people are leaving. we're still here watching and clicking and leaving likes. ): Sorry i can't be an extra 100 views for y'all.
I'm still here watching my favorites 🥺 This makes me sad. But i'm glad & happy everyone is at peace & living their best lives. I'm still here on the sidelines cheering them on ☺️🤍
Just kind of ironic that I only watch tiktok vids from YouTube or any other social media other than tiktok itself lol I can’t stand the setup of tiktok. I’ll be watching YouTube until they actually shut YouTube down themselves lol
I loved it when JEFFREE said HI UALL, IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT IS WHAT I SAY ,I LIVE IN WEST VIRGINIA
Not the thumbnail change 💀
That gate!!!!
Stop making me cry like why am I so emotional rn 😊I’m at the part where they just got into his house and I’ve cried 3 times already
I love watching Shane and Jeffree together because Ryland is always just chillin in the back trying to fit in and be included. 😭😂
Me watching Jeffree say no one watches YouTube anymore 👁👄👁
I am on the EDGE OF MY SEAT for this pallette... show it show it show it!!
Ive personally grown up on youtube and am very active daily, I do understand creators being frustrated tho.
I want more yak colors like that purple one. Also still trying to get Jeffree to do a rainbow yak for my 7 year old son. Also I watch YouTube all the time.
NOOOOOOOOOO JEFFREYYYYYYY 😢
I agree that YouTube sucks now. I only watch old videos of my favorite YouTubers. I'm not impressed with new content anymore except for Shane's. Everything just seems so try-hard now or extremely overdone. So I'm just left watching old content that I still love.
Aw. I can't wait to read Jeffree's book
I love to watch Jeffreys YouTube videos. But he have to do whatever he thinks is best for him❤️
Littt💥💥
I run to Jeffrees channel when a new vid drops. Same with Shane and crew. Other than that, don’t watch much else.
Jeffery sound low-key bitter. I live for Shane and Rylands podcasts and channels.
oh my god someone needs to tell ryland how iconic his airport fit was
BOY YOUTUBE IS VERY MUCH A THING. I’d die without it.
Hey now I watch YouTube on the daily lol
do they sell to Canada? I want the breeze comforter
A spiritual awakening caught on camera , thank you Jeffree for inspiring us.
Nothing brings me more joy than Jeffree and Shane together.
YouTube is very much a thing. It’s the only app I’m on anymore.
Does it feel like Shane doesn't keep up with his friends, even online?
babe ! we care about YouTube! don’t leave us. We absolutely love watching you, Shane etc.
I love you so much Shane!! ❤
Jeffree star quitting youtube is so sad to me. This guy had the entire makeup community in his hands at one point, sad how things change. Regardless of what you think of him, Jeffree is always going to be a legend. His impact has been unreal
this is my favorite era of jeffrey
Jeffree is an animal abuser and murderer and yall are partaking in it by eating his victims smh yall disgust me
Wait guys....I still love YouTube
I’m literally a mess right now 😭 no more YouTube
Damn I'm addicted again
Please Jeffree.. don't quit on us.😭  Please do a paranormal series with Jeffree! I feel like the ghosts and paranormal sh*t won't be able to handle both your energies 🤣
Jeffrey looks so good and seems so much happier. maybe more morose, but somehow happier. i love him. he looks so hot though
I definitely care I love YouTube I use this app literally all day
🤙🏻
I REALLY THINK YALL NEED TO RELEASE THE PALETTE! 😭 PLEASEEEEE! 🙏🤞
That gate is awesome
I'm fucking loving this evolved Jeffrey.. I mean I'm livviinngggg for it alll woooww ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Jeffree is actually so funny
I watch YouTube literally every day. I wish Jeffree still made makeup videos I loved his excitement amount makeup.
J: Chris have you met my Pomeranians?  C: I don’t think so?  … really?
All I want in this world is a small few acre farm and to be self sustaining.... I totally understand wanting a simple life!
Honestly, I don’t know how anyone could thrive within the mess that is “popularity and fame” in California - especially these days. Not only am I proud of Jeffree; seeing him just thrive in a more normal and peaceful environment; I’m also proud of you and Ryland, Shane. I’m sure the move outside of California wasn’t an easy one, but I see the same peace within you two, that I do in Jeffree!

I know Jeffree won't read this, but people do care about YouTube, just because is not the biggest thing anymore doesn't mean that there's not still a massive community that cares a lot about youtube
💜
There are  a ton of people that watch. We always loved you reviewing makeup. Review any kind makeup we would be happy. But on the other hand if youtube is a chore and you don’t get fulfillment then we understand. I always learn about new collections by you on youtube. Please don’t giveup on makeup we still want the high quality eyeshadows and the experience of every new collectioN❤
Ok so I'm late to the party but......WTF JUST HAPPENED?! I'm so sad now! No Jeffree u stay dammit! I still watch every video that's posted 😭😭 Shane, u and Ryland aren't leaving right?? Right?! I hate change 😭😭 I do understand where Jeffree is coming from and see his point, just sad to even see him want to leave YouTube.  Guess that's part of growing as a person and things changing, doesn't mean I have ta like it lol damn now I'm all bummed out n shit 😔
I would say to Jeffree, that there are people that love youtube still,  and it may not be millions and millions,  but that's ok.
For the record, I always watch Jeffree's videos. But I totally understand where he's coming from. I'm sad about it but am also so happy for him.
Jeffrey star just gained so much respect from me omg what an amazing person to take a mansion and sell it and buy a farm and start feeding the people in the town with clean meat that is the goal in life ❤❤❤❤
I absolutely love seeing Shane and Jeffree together. I’m so happy watching this!
i love youtube awh
Yalll I cried so hard seeing them in the car just talking and Jeffree talking about hard working people in his town I’m so proud of Him omg
Oh no..
Jeffree and Shane’s friendship is so iconic and such a vibe!  I kind of almost feel bad for Ryland when they’re all together because Jeffree and Shane just feed off of each other so well. But Ryland’s videos that he puts out are sooo good, I wish more people watched him because he deserves it with all the time he puts into those videos. I’m so dang excited for them to have a baby🥰
I loved this vlog. Thank you!
Stahp no..I’m crying :( plz don’t quit !!
Jeffrey somehow looks way more laid back and relaxed! Nature and cattle are good for him :) Much love!
I spend probably 40-60% of my day on youtube. I love youtube, I love supporting creators and I love watching and keeping up to date with people. However I noticed youtubers don't post as much, more big streamers are what's popular gaming is becoming more of a thing you like to do in private then share with everyone, every creator his a clique they play with and more. I feel the creators are getting more tired of youtube then youtube is getting of them. I tried my fair share of making garbage content on here and I have to say the reward you get doesn't seem to cut close to work you put in. Staying revelant in this world is hard so I don't blame jeffree for moving into the meat industry and just focusing on his brands because creating content isn't where it's at right now unless you are a group of streamers that boost each other.
I disagree i love youtube still
UGH PLEASE THE BABIES!!
I’m still here every day hoping YouTube will go back to how it used to be. Long form all the way
I swear if jeffree stops YouTube I’m dying 😢
I see what Jeffree is saying but i gotta disagree, i love YouTube! But i see how tik tok could become the future with instant gratification. But i love YouTube.
I WATCH! I CARE! NOOOO.I NEED JEFREE STAR APPROVED.
It’s scary to hear Jeffrey say that YouTube is dead. I suffer from severe manic depression and the way I calm down when I’m super manic or lighten the mood when I’m super depressed is by watching YouTube. It has literally saved my life. I feel so sad for Jeffrey that he feels like no one cares. I care and I’m sure there’s a lot of other people out there that feel the same way.
WE NEED A PARANORMAL SERIES WITH SHANE & JEFFREE IN WYOMING OR MAYBE ALL OVER AMERICA...THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY INSANE & HILARIOUS! 🙏🤞🤣
Been waiting to watch this since last week
Still watching and I appreciate how mature you are.
Im sad that yaks are being eaten.
I figured Jeffree was done creating content for Youtube but it does suck hearing him confirm it. His love for makeup always shined through in his videos & it's so rare to find that nowadays. A lot of creators in the makeup world are boring, have no sense of humor, stray off topic, or have no business even reviewing or doing tutorials. So idk, it just sucks to see one of the greats go. I do love where Jeffree is at in life, he seems so happy... & less social media/internet is surely never a bad thing. I would just hate to see him hop off Youtube just to go over to TicTok. Cuz I refuse to get TicTok, idc. 😂
I am so happy that Shane and Jeffree are so happy. But i agree with others here that i don't agree about YouTube. We watch hours a day..... Still love y'all 💞
I feel exactly the same as Jeffree. My soul is screaming to be some where else than where I am. I'm just a poor bitch that will never have the chance to actually settle my soul. 🥲
Stop trying to make Jeffree happen, it's not happening. Side note: when was the last time you talked to Eugenia? Have you seen her recent videos? Are you not worried?
I miss the old youtube days but I love the new real documentary style videos too..........
Jeffries living situation is what I dream of.
He made how much off of a purse 😮 want to donate 200,000 to a girly in need to pay off a house 😂
Good luck to Jeffree and his journey ❤️
YEAH AND I ONLY EAT LOWER FOOD CHAIN ANIMALS LIKE FISH AND BIRD AND ONLY 2 WELL KNOWN BIRDS 🦃🐓AND NO OTHER BIRDS EVER. AND NO BIG SEA ANIMALS THAT ARE HOLY LIKE YAKS ON EARTH ONLY SEAFOOD I CAN GET AND IM SO HAPPY. &&ID CONSIDER THEM MY FAMILY- IMAGINE- YOU RAISE THEM. AND DONT THINK ABOUT EATING YOUR DOGS!!
I haaaate that people are leaving youtube 😭 i dont want 5 second videos on tiktok. I want 40 minutes vlogs on youtube god damn it! 😭😭 please dont EVER leave yotube Shane, Ryland and Morgan 🙏
love you guys so much. keep going pls. it brings me joy
I was a latecomer to the beauty world on YouTube. I only used YouTube for music videos, until one hungover day back in 2018 I got a recommendation on my homepage for a JS video based on a make up tutorial I watched for a night out… I ended up watching JS videos all day/night and through that was introduced to you Shane. What a journey it’s been these last few years. JS catapulted me into a world of make up I never knew existed and as a result I’ve built my make up collection and have products I’d never even considered buying in the past. Shane’s world catapulted me into a world of YouTube I didn’t even know existed and it’s been fascinating. I thank you both. It’s sad to hear about JS quitting YouTube but I get it. Life is ever changing and you have to go with the ebbs and flows of it all. TikTok is fun but it’s nothing like YouTube. I’ll still be tuning in to my fave content creators for as long as they keep making content. I feel people will get bored of tiktok a lot quicker than any other platform and YouTube will always be here to stay… hopefully !!!
Finally someone noticed how fuckin creepy and haunted wyoming is!! We have all the activity here!
Swore Well over 5 years ago to keep meat out of my diet and my periods that were 3 weeks long where I’d pass out stopped and became regular again. They’re normal now! I always knew it was wrong and couldn’t deny it even in a YUM UNDENIABLE MOMENT but still that’s that. Not a whole murder factory home gone rogue. Fk JEFFREE I’m hurt. ☮️🌎
I haven’t left YouTube , it’s my #1 choice on top of all the Disney and Netflix apps. And the fact that Jeffery is leaving makes me sad 😢
So I live in Wyoming! I ate at the firerock and had the yak burger and it was soooooo good! I was so surprised! I love seeing Shane and Jeffree and even ryland just in a good place
I understand Jeffree wanting to leave YouTube but it saddens me as I don't watch anything but YouTube.  Shane and Ryland's videos are my favorites. Most of my favorite YouTube favorites have already left. I hope Shane and Ryland never leave me.
It’s crazy bc I still watch YouTube religiously
Jeffree better not give you any ideas of quitting YouTube! I’m still watching daily! I feel sad he’s leaving and will be the saddest if you and Ryland left! You don’t know us, but you are like family to us!!!❤
AND ANY OTHER OF JEFFREES MONOCHROMATIC MOMENTS OF SOME HIGHLIGHTERS ESPECIALLY THE ONES ON LOCK W THE PEARL PIGMENTS WOULDVE SLAYED AT THAT LIGHTING 13:40 BYE MF
how many "haha" are in this video
Laughing in European at what they consider a normal house =)))))
I understand where Jeffree is coming from. TikTok will always be people's preferred way of watching videos. You can record up to 10 minutes. Also with our attention spans we like quick content. Everyone on Tiktok promotes their YouTube channel but it doesn't get the following or views like Tiktok does. I can feel the frustration that YouTube doesn't reach as many people anymore  or new followers. I watch YouTube on a daily basis but I end up watching Tiktok.
Yes Shane n Jeffree do ghosties ??
This is such a cash grab, like he isn't even hiding it. I thought the beauty world was to much "drama" for little old poor Shane. Yet here we are.
My god I love Jeffree❤️❤️❤️
I love the whole Jeffree/Shane dynamic.
I get it. I do. But I that last comment 😭 I miss Jenna Marbles so much. I feel like I’m losing friends.
Wow what a aye opener he seems happy being out there I'm happy for him away from all. The shit I wish i had that amount of money to get the fuck away from everything
Ryland I think you shouldn’t have changed your clothes. You looked like you were going to the beach and wanted all the attention. What you had on was fine.
I love that Shane is back to making YouTube videos, but maybe turn back the dial on the drama because it’s really anti-climatic. It’s also not what people want anymore. This is 100% interesting to a lot of people but maybe take a more informative approach and produce a genuine video that excels in videography and story telling instead of trying to capture that shock value. No one wants it anymore and it’s just really not that “shocking”.
Omfg I don’t want Jeffrey to leaveeee 😢
Jeffree saying that YouTube isn’t fun anymore and that he’s gonna quit soon really made me think. And that sad truth is that as creators in this platform we all have to face that eventually wether is cancel culture that ruined it or just the endless possibilities of streaming services are out there. I feel like once you get big on youtube you have to face that eventually your gonna be outdated and sometimes we don’t know why this happens to us or why no one cares anymore but I just feel like we people always like to see what’s new in store, and even though new can be scary, at the same time it can lead us to something even bigger that no one has ever imagined. I really do wish the best for Jeffree and Shane.
- That……. ENDING……. 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞
YouTube is still my favorite, the problem is that Jeffree hasn’t evolved with YouTube content. Many creators have evolved and have a lot of views with vlogs or podcasts for example.
Jeffree I will watch n share n die to keep you on YouTube omg I'm so fucking safe fuck this
I miss the old YouTube… I’m so happy for this series!! Conspiracy was the best series!! I’m watching right now hoping one day the cancelled palette gets produced!! I’d kill for it 😭😭
I hate tik tok ok it's like watching nothing I don't get the shorter content thing I know it's sad so many have left YouTube but I don't think it'll ever die because we all want or crave the creative if we want the old YouTube back we have to be louder than the tik tokers
It makes me sad to think YouTube might die. I only watch YouTube… 😢
I still love my pallets and I love them my jawbreaker and the mini for that got stole but my conspiracy one
I absolutely loved this! 😍😍
BITCH LET ME TELL YOU THIS I am DREAMING about Conspiracy palette and i can’t get her and IT’S BEEN TWO FUCKING YEARS!!!! I watch every video of you and every Jeffrey video, and if any of you stop posting i’ll be watching all your old stuff and that’s all. i’m a little human i can’t change anything i just take what was given
Wasnt this called the retirement of jeffree star… I didn’t watch it so idk
Jeffree is iconic af. That’s all.
I look to YouTube so often and I can see it dying. It makes me so sad everyday. I miss all of my favorite creators that have left. Ryland is my only consistent comfort on YouTube because of the sip podcast
I love this.
Jeffree looks calm, content and happier than I ever remember seeing him. Its wonderful to see him so grounded. I wonder if he'll just slowly disappear off all social media in the near future?......He's definitely living his best life, and that makes me so happy. 🥰
When Ryland changed into his 2nd outfit all I could think about was Crawl from Son-in-Law! LMAO
Jeffree made the right choice getting out of California.
Jeffee we still watch . Love this even better than the last one. Thank You Shane. Chris is an amazing job getting this content 👏
MO JEFFREE NOOOO WHAT DO I DO I TIHOIGHT THE YAKS WERE YOUR FAMILY JUST BECAUSE YOURE A SCORPIO DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO KILL ANYTHING YOU RULE THE EARTH WITH LOVE AND BY LOVING I GET IT BUT NOOO ND SAME BUT NO DONT KILL AMD EAT THEM OR SAY U DID A FEW TIMES AND YOURE SORRY AND YOUD NEVER DO IT EVER AGAIN LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED WHHAT HAPPENED TO THE MOTHER JEFFREE I KNEW U ALSO RULED CAPRICORN BY  CARING AND SANCTIONING THEM PRIVATELY I KNOW BITCHES BE WEIRD AND MESSED UP BUT U WERENT BAE!! CMON PLS MOTHER EARTH IN JEFFREE STAR BE REBORN OR I AM BROKEN FOREVERRR!!
Jeffree is so funny lol
🙋 all I watch is YouTube . don't leave me !!!!!😭😭😭
I hope that you two can bring YouTube back with this series even if jeffree hangs up his hat he can make cameos in videos I love both of you guys
Not me sitting here with YT premium cuz I hate Instagram and Tiktok lol. 😂 I’m sad to hear that especially as a new creator but I understand it.
I’ve always respected Jeffree and his hard work, but my respect for him is at a whole new level after this! Just as life should be! Living it how you want and not caring what others think!!
Go DAWGS!🥰  (If you know, u know😂)
Wait jeffree wtffffffff?!?!?! I absolutely love YouTube videos!! Every time I’m cooking or cleaning or getting ready I rewatch the Shane and Jeffree series! It’s entertaining, comforting and familiar to us all!!! It was an epic time in the makeup game and no one did it like u two!! I absolutely love this series and I wish u guys just made your own channel!! The makeup industry has been dead and this launch would be EVERYTHING🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉!!!! I absolutely need a pallet 🎉🎉🎉  Shane this is amazing and I can see how happy this makes u❤ it’s like the good old days without the drama,I’m living for this
here I am watching this for enjoyment and fun... 53:38
When they approach the ranch, Shane was having his Annie moment from Parent Trap.
Just over here feeling like a nobody now… I don’t even have TikTok.. I’m on YouTube DAILY… right now…. But the Star doesn’t even pop on my feed anymore???
Ryland is so supportive. I hope Shane really appreciates him.
Jeffree is more himself ❤ I love it !!
watching the ending as an 07 raised on youtube, everyone from shane to buzzfeed unsolved it's so sad to see all this come to an end. i will never stop watching youtube but i know people around me have and that makes me so incredibly sad
Jeffree nooooo😢 don’t quit
I'm more into his skin range as he has amazing skin
For me this really shows that Jeffree Star and Shane have grown and matured. Jeffree might be walking a different path from Shane when it comes to using Youtube but that is because he is a business man, and I totally get that. I am so happy for them.
This video just made me wanna buy makeup and an expensive ass Hummer for no reason
I will always watch you guys🥺
love you guy don’t leave the tube just create your own website
Jeffree making jerky and using a silencer 😅 just when I thought this b  couldn’t get more iconic
ok but i'm with you shane.. I'm terrified of planes too no matter how many times ride them😂
Do you think Jeffrey was showing shade at Dawson when he said YouTube is dead???
PLEASE DO A HAUNTED SERIES IN WYOMING WITH JEFFREE THAT WOULD BE EVERYTHING
Just wanna say I always watch Jeffree's youtube. I'm not a makeup girl myself but I watch for the energy and always lifts my mood. Thank you.
This video broke my heart 😢 Jeffree Stars personality as well as Shanes and Rylands have always gave me not only happiness, joy, and laughter but also a sense of comfort. I get that life goes on & this day was going to come one day but I'm not ready for that day to happen just yet😢😢😢😢
yt dyeing cause all the ads to be honest.  I am just to old though probley^^  tic tock ok I can't stay on it   its to plan no story no actual conection to the story.   and for the love of god ryald u do u  your style is so good when u just pick the pieces u love.
So basically Jeffree sold his bags and bought a whole farm with that money
youtube is absolutely not dead
Love Jeffree's new life
I am watching YouTube every day.  I like walking around listening to YouTube .  People may not be watching makeup videos anymore.  It is nice to see the perspective of the business owner, it's all about the money not the audience.   I have a small channel but do it for the love of it not for money.
Odd, making Tik Toks and not reading comments, doesn't care, just wants to play with makeup, adjust to the current market, but will stop making YouTube videos because no one is clicking and it's not worth it. Seems like a contradiction. If the Tik Toks are make it because you enjoy it, why couldn't YouYube be that way? I mean, if you're genuinely unhappy, absolutely, you do you. But from the cut of that conversation we saw, there's a lot of emphasis on numbers. For the record, I'm here! 🙋‍♀️ Lots of people are here and enjoy the content of both Jeffree and Shane!
I'm shocked you don't get dekonitized for pew pews. I watch another channel and he can't show his ot even say the word.
Sorry you are wrong. I watch it all the time. I watch all of you to slot videos. I watch food videos. You just called me boring I guess. This time, I think you are throwing in the towel to soon. Just my opinion. Take care.
i loke only watch youtube , I spend my life on youtube
Not gonna lie, seeing how happy & relaxed Jeffree is now, happens to awesome! Not having much stress, able to think more clearly, not having noisy neighbours!
Shane grabbing the gun with the pinky up 😂
You can see how much Jeffree has changed. He looks so much more healthier and happy. 💜
I miss old YouTube sooo much. Everything is for show now and feels like an ad
I could watch them for hours lol
my new favorite jeffree and shane lol !!
I live for the fact that jefferee mentioned ghosts yo
Did you rename this episode? I thought it said The Retirement of Jeffree Starr
IM STILL ON YOUTUBEEEE WE STIL CARE AND LOVE YOU GUYS . please don’t make my depression worse by taking away the only thing i had for joy😩 honestly . you guys are the reason why some of us are still on this planet.
I watch YouTube and fb videos more than anything else. I'm sad that jeffree feels this way! 😭
Chris asking “can I pet a yak” 🥺🥺🥲
i love this
When he calls it a « jenna marbles » i cried. Jennaaa gurrrrrrl 😢
I’m loving this so much right now and jeffree looks happier than ever. But also bittersweet knowing he’s leaving YouTube 🥺
Shannnnnnnne please don't ever leave you tube .Ever !
Yo! That new hummer features looks so fun!
Please don't leave youtube Jeffree :/
21:48 jeffree is giving masc4masc energy here, he even sounds so different. let me have that wyoming detox now, miss hunny!
There are people that still care, like me, that like watching are favorite people on YouTube.
youtube is still my niche, i still love it so much 🥺
I still have my pallet ❤️ I will never get rid of it
The friken P90 and MP9 just CASUALLY on the counter 😆😆😆😆😆
OMG! Im living for this sooo much!!❤❤❤❤ I love every single one of you!
I love you and Jeffree together. I'm so sad to hear he's thinking of quitting youtube. There are still plenty of us who support you and don't want you to leave 💙
Wtf does being cancelled mean? Like I’d it literally thst YouTube has taken your rights to upload for a period of time or is it words you all throw around lightly ..
Damn we're getting old , I was here from the start . This series is getting really emotional 😢
Jeffree looks even hotter now and he does look more relaxed and at peace. Happy for him
I have watched Shane & Jeffree pretty much since their first years of starting youtube. And watching how almost 180 they have come from going bigger and badder to just so simple and down to earth is just a beautiful journey. The energy just simply in this video is soo calm, simple, and honest. Grateful to not have followed the cancelled train. Sticking through and watching their journeys fully through. Its just beautiful.
Well, never thought I'd want to watch a Ghost video with Jeffree in it but here we are...
Jeffree’s Youtube channel is basically just promoting his company. Not dogging it, just saying. He’s right, the cosmetic industry has tanked and Covid played a huge part in it. He seems happier and enjoying Wyoming. That chapter has closed. I do wish he’d maybe try to either make more content with his life in Wyoming because he is a very interesting and entertaining person. I honestly wouldn’t mind watching like how he got his burgers into restaurants, his marijuana dispensaries, etc. At this point too, maybe Shane and Jeffree should move to streaming services as well.
Jeffree: ‘Nobody watches anymore’ ‘nobody’s clicking anymore’ ‘wasting our time’  Also jeffree: still has millions of views on every single video
I mean if it wasn’t for you guys I wouldn’t be here ❤
It’s the end of an era 😢
Jeffree mentioned Jenna and about to quit YT is like a hammer hitter my face. 😢 But I get how they feel. YouTube sucks.
Wait!! Wait.... Jefree bought the castle before covid. Huh? I've lost 3 years... like poof.. gone. Noo really... wait... the fudge....
Dude I’m on YouTube for like hours a day most days. Keep in mind, I have a full life. This is just where I consume most of my media. All my favorite creators are here, and I feel actually inspired and happy because of their content.. I was low key triggered hearing Jeffree say that. Not true.
YouTube will never die! ✌️
Okay don’t get me wrong I get what you’re saying… but I don’t think YouTube is dead yet like, I just one person but I’m on here a lot and I appreciate the content y’all put out 🖤
I feel bad for Ryland. He has to watch shane endlessly flirt with chris while being treated like a personal assistant.   Meanwhile his family is the only reason shanes image was rehabbed. You don’t need tell your audience that you and ryland fight in an ad read. its embarassing
When Jeffree said "thats the future" about TikTok I laughed out loud as much as ya'll that is terrifying LOL
It's so great seeing you guys together again! I've missed the chemistry you have, it's awesome
I watch youtube all the time, like everyday, but i am so happy for you Jeffree that you are in a good place in life, that's all that matters, i truly adore you and admire you, of course i love you Shane, Ryland and Chris too :D Can't wait to the other part :)
You guys are such an inspiration ❤ International fan of Jeffree, Shane and his family. ❤ from 🇮🇳
This is such a full circle moment. I watch you and Jeffree’s videos on repeat everyday, they bring me so much comfort and help my anxiety. Seriously shane you are a safe haven and comfort place for so many people. Thank you!!!!! This is also my first comment ever on YouTube and I have been watching since food videos, hahahaha
Its to sad for me hering jeffree saying that about YouTube because for me someone how love you gays and living far away in Africa to not be able to see all of you and And I hear you and live with you a life that I can't dream of even very sad I think that you became like my family on YouTube we lost you like the loss of a family member because you give me ambition and dream with everything I live in my daily life all the racism and conspiracies bullying and family disease I forget all that while I am And I hear you and live with you a life that I can't dream of even very sad I think that you became like my family on YouTube we lost you like the loss of a family member because you give me ambition and dream with everything I live in my daily life all the racism and conspiracies bullying and family disease I forget all that and I watch you so I wish if Jeffrey knows that and knows that I am very happy with everything new in your life it is the new life and happiness for you I love you all my family ❤️
I’m still clicking😮😢….
Its a very far fetched statement saying that no one watches or cares about youtube anymore. I am on it daily trying to find something interesting to watch but imo good and unique content is lacking these days. Ever since the youtube drama and everyone becoming so sensitive to everything, youtube became more boring because creators seem to be afraid to produce videos just in case they do or say something that will get them cancelled in the future. I am just finding my self watching the most random docs about the most random subjects like how Tutankhamun's family tree was so inbred for example....  🤦‍♀
Am I crazy or was the title changed?
I am ☠ over the pinball Hall of Fame pictures 🤣
paranormal series PLEASE
I’m crying because YouTube is really the only thing I use. I especially only have this app for Jeffree ❤😢
Honestly, Jeffree is so damn funny. I would LOVEEEE to be friends with him!
I stil watch YouTube, I don’t have tik tok so I’m still here!! I love you Shane and jeffree
Am I the only one who gets motion sick from the camera angle/ maneuvering?   Still enjoyed it, and still selfishly want jeffree to stay :<
I HAVE to say that YouTube is still one of my main platforms to get content. I watch YT everyday because it's my favorite type of content. The passion you can feel from Shane is just different. I understand Jeffree needing to retire from YouTube, but Shane, we still need you!
I’m sorry… you’re telling me, when I was in Wyoming, looking for dinosaur bones for a class, I could have seen Jeffree fucking star??
I just saw a tik tok that Shane is in love with Jeffree and now imma watch this with that in mind.
My parents lived in Dubois, Wyoming in a cabin on a mountain for six years and my mom made friends with a bunch of deer she'd feed. They recently moved back to Washington to be closer to family but I still regret never getting a chance to visit Wyoming.
When Jeffree pulled out the gun I died laughing.
Watching Jeffree after so long☺️☺️☺️
To be a part of this friendship would b unreal ❤️
Maybe I’m the weird one but I’m watching more YouTube than I used to, not the other way around.
i’m sorry but ryland is sooooo irritating:(
22:00 did it REALLY felt it necessarry to leave the absurd gun handling bit in the video?
Not me crying when Jeffree star say he done with YouTube 😭😭😭
Shane holding a gun 😂😂
Wasn’t this called the retirement of Jeffery star? Or did I slip into another dimension?
D E A D Ryland : " i'LL cook you right up XD"
I been watching Shane since the dmv parody this is beautiful
So crazy to really think YouTube is “dead” I mean I hardly watch anything only my favourites.. very scary for the future really of what will be next
I am here for this
I hate that it’s true but YouTube just isn’t the same. I never even see good content anymore. I’m still into watching vlogs, beauty, tutorials but the creators just aren’t into it anymore. So sad
I disagree with Jeffree that yt doesn't matter anymore... I still watch it a lot but maybe bc im older idk
This made me so sad because I still use YouTube for joy…everyday maybe it’s because I literally grew up watching Shane and Jeffree and now I love Ryland, Morgan, the podcastS (plural!!) I’m so so sad I hate tik tok I don’t want to scroll through those videos and small little enjoyment I love hour long videos of my favorite people. I could actually sob 😢
My heart just broke hearing him say he’s quitting YouTube and that no one cares to watch anymore 😭💔
I wish they would of made the pallet 🥺
I still watch YouTube, it's better watch a long video with some explanation: like podcasts or tutorials, or even just a review than a 1 min video..
youtube still alive, everyones cares about youtube, you not care about youtube because u already made the money
I watched YouTube every single day. I never turn on Netflix or Hulu...
Like how come Jeffery looks so much better! Like best is yet to come!
Jeffrey becomes relaxed and himself when u r together.
Drop the pallet Shane plenty of people will buy it !!!
The real reason rich people and elites are selling up their big houses and expensive clothes, items and moving out big cities is because they know there’s about to be a huge financial crash and it will all be worthless. That’s what the farmlands they’re buying up are for, food and water will be the most expensive thing that people need.
I did not know Jeffrey was on tiktok, I hope keeps creating contents in his own time
.... one of those two last videos better be "riding a space x rocket for my new galaxy (Uranus) eyeshadow  pallet
Jeffree  i will miss your videos on here... all the best it was a crazy ride 😆
Shane and Jeffree together is awesome and seeing how they are both in a good space is amazing!
Honestly, fuck TikTok. It's so fake and shallow with its short attention span scripted content. I would watch a 1 hour video on YT any day over 5 minutes spent on TikTok. I'm happy for Jeffree, he seems in such a better place, but I'll miss the sit down and chill vibes.
Haha poor Shane when he held the gun I think he forgot how hardcore and crazy Jeffrey is
The lack of gun safety going on in the hummer 🥴 Shane is just practically pointing it at Jeffree’s thigh 🥴 maybe let’s not flail a gun around like it’s a toy 😅
Miss this
i’ve always loved jeffree. he keeps it so real and does what he wants even if he’s been cancelled a billion times
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
This is so sad! 😢
Me when Jeffree says no one watches youtube anymore 👁👄👁
i dont mind jeffree but don't agree i watch YouTube basically all day everyday lol
I feel bad for Ryland being left out
So Jefree please start your own mega TV company! Yasssss You are so much bigger than YouTube.
This can’t be real
I still love youtube :'( gutted jeffree quitting. What an amazing video though  cant wait for the next. Hope they sell it because I'd by that up so fast
I think I’m one of the only people that still comes home and watches YouTube for hours after a long day 😅
Jeffery's transition from a glamorous, boujee lifestyle in Los Angeles filled with designer fashion and mansions, to a secluded yak ranch in the middle of nowhere and just living life as a farmer is... Just the best vibe ever. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that LA lifestyle, I just love that it seems like he's trying to live life as his more authentic self and he seems so happy and proud of what he has. He's still into all the makeup and fashion, but he's choosing to express himself more authentically and that is so beautiful to see.
No matter the different platforms to watch tv shows and stuff like that  I will always click YouTube  As I am here now x I don’t watch Jeffree as much anymore because it became repetitive x
Not me wanting to move to Casper to be close to Jeffree 😭
I live in TX & own guns myself, but having all those big ass guns just out and about casually laying in his car and around his house is so irresponsible
Shit man - didn’t see that one coming!!!! 😢 I love Jeffree and I love you tube I’m on here everyday but I can see how the younger milienials are watching ricochet and doing more with instagram now, but I love you use !
My favorite thing of the entire video is Jeffree saying, " don't put your finger on the trigger. We don't want shoot the new hummer." Hahahah ♡
I still like YouTube! It’s a daily thing for me - not just for entertainment, but for information and learning. TikTok has its place in the world of course, short forum content is the trend - but I see it as a snack, whereas YouTube is the main meal xx ❤❤
I’m so so sooooo sad Jeffree Star is quitting YouTube!😭 I completely disagree. I still watch YouTube every day and would watch anything he posted… and I think a whole bunch of people would agree with me, we miss him!😭♥️ Thank you for posting a video about him Shane.. of course I click anything you post too😋 And Ryland of course. But seriously… YouTube is not dead! Your loyal fans are still here and we miss you. And PS, I hate tic toc. Love you guys and it’s so good to see you all back together♥️♥️♥️🎉
Omg please please please do you guys ghost hunting! That'd be fantastic
I watch youtube everyday. I don't know what he is talking about :).
All good things come to an end, however I think people should be happy for Jeffree. He seems so happy and just at peace which he deserves. It has been an absolute crazy ride and I wish it would never end. I honestly wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors 💕  I hate how popular TikTok is, I absolutely still love YouTube and will continue to support my favorite creators 🥲
the thing i love more than this vid is how good of friends they are like the world has thrown so much shit as the both of them and it has just strengthened the bond, they have it is the best thing to watch and can't wait to see what's next for the both of them
I literally been staring at Jeffree trying to figure something out and I’m like “OMG THE EYEBROWSSS! HE HAS EYEBROWS” (also love that he has guns and was showing Shane safe gun procedures for not even 2 minutes)
I watch YouTube every day still, but just not Jeffrey or Shane or that older type of video.   I love the true crime community! Paranormal shit and conspiracy videos Yanno. It’s all person preference but I ain’t watching YouTube for makeup or that sorta stuff anymore
I literally do not know what id do without YouTube
Youtube may be dying, but I still go to youtube for entertainment
Y'all were playing with a gun in an airport parking lot 🤣
i hate this back and forth between new and old videos, just do the whole thing in order :( it drives me nuts
Jeffree looks so much healthier 😊
Girl I love a good suppressor!!!! ❤ ha ha. I love you!
I’m freakin LOVING Ranchy Jeffree! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I think Jeffree is missing a point here with whole Youtube-Tiktok comparison. He has 35 million views of his jumping near a yack. So? Its a 4 second video. People forgot about it after watching next 3 shorts on Tiktok. While youtube you create conctent for 10-20-50 min. People that watch your youtube video invest time in you, dont just scroll down to watch random 3 sec tiktoks. Thats Youtubes value. I bet if you ask your new tiktokers if they remember a blond guy jumping on his ranch they would be like “what are you talking about, I saw 500 tiktoks today, i dont remember.
to be honest , i don’t watch makeup content  anymore but i would 1000000% still watch jeffeee if he did like day in the life type stuff
I feel like everyone is going to leave YouTube and we will have no one to watch anymore. Fml
I still care, but I guess the 1 million + views won't ever be enough 😓
Ugh honestly lot of us still watches youtube, yes theres tiktok and all of these app on tv to watch but nothing is closer as a content creator, lot of us trying  to leave that "daily" routine and spend time for ourselves by watching our favorite youtubers after a long day. As a mom and business owner i have little time and gotta be honest everytime shane uploads im here to watch it, move my schedule around it. I been supporting you since the very begining and i will until the end. 😢
My heart breaks to think I won't see Jeffree on YouTube launching make up and reviewing products anymore, but I am so happy he's found a peaceful and fulfilled live in Wyoming. Seeing him there with you, Shane, and Ryland, Chris and Maddie made my heart so full. I hope it lasts forever ❤️
Maybe people just don’t watch Jeffries videos … plenty of people still love YouTube and watch daily
I watch youtube almost everyday still. I still follow and subscribe to a bunch of people... so that isn't true.
Jeffree literally living the dream life
Omg the stock footage at 23.49 is of my town 🥹
800K people watched this episode and all within the last 15 hours.. Still think Youtube sucks, Jeffree?
Shane u better not stop YouTube! Can’t like you either 😢
I am sorry, I dont have tiktok and not planning to. If Jeffree quits Youtube I am done with him. I am not gonna jump on TikTok wagon, no missy
this video makes me so happy 🤩 seeing Shane and Jeffree back together makes my heart smile!
YouTube has definitely reached its peak and has been in decline. I miss the heyday but I’m old enough to have seen so many online spaces fall in and out of popularity. But on a positive note, it may bring back the days where this was just a creative outlet for people and views didn’t matter much because not many people were even on here. I can understand Jeffree feeling like he’s done it all and as a business owner wants to focus on the best platform to market his cosmetics. I hope he comes back to collab with Shane or others in the future, long form videos let us see his personality and how sharp, funny and interesting he is and I’ll miss that. I’ll always have a special place in my heart for Shane and Jeffree, especially together. I live for your friendship! Y’all got me through some dark shit in life ❤❤
Please do a haunted adventure with Jeffree!
I’m sorry but Jeffree’s energy is UNMATCHED
Truly if i never got a goodbye or they suddenly didnt post anymore or wasnt making content, genuinely i would be so upset. They make me truly feel like were all on the journey together and the past cant be chnaged, but, it doesnt mean theres no light at the end of the tunnel
"Let's not shoot the new hummer."  Fuck I missed this duo
this isnt a docu, it's a long vlog💀
SHANE DONT LEAVE US!! WE ARE CLICKING ON YOUR VIDEO MATE DONT LEAVE US
Lots of people still click and watch Youtube.  Please don't abandon us. LOL
What??? Watching YouTube is the only place I watch anything 😢 noooooo don’t stop Jeffrey
16:30 he better WALK in ✨
i wish youtube wasn’t dying. i still try and find videos to watch and get so excited when i do find something. but yah no one is clicking and no one is producing anymore
I think like Jefree said he does things to the max so that’s why he doesn’t feel like there’s a point in YouTube but I still watch and so do a lot of other people maybe not 35million but think about how many of those views were out of hate and not because they want to see you successful
Podcast destroyed youtube!!!! Everybody and their mom has a podcast and youtubers got lazy on being creative
I love YouTube still but I watch True Crime only on here, stopped with the beauty stuff a longggg time ago… BUT I’ll always come back for Shane & Jeffree 😍
Please do more Jeffree and Shane content!!! 😭😭 I love y’all’s vibe!!!
What is the name of the very last song that’s played? It’s driving me crazy hunting it down. HELP!
"don't you dare take away my victory" ROFL 😂
YouTube is all I have…..😮😢
Ok I was laughing and smiling so much watching this so happy decided to do another video with Jeffery Ryland and Chris. Sooooo sad that Jeffrey thinks YouTube is dead yes I watch less but that’s because content is less and few and far between this is what the OG’s live for this type of content . I’m living for it if you’ll had a tv series I would watch it where ever Netflix or whatever . Please continue as long as it makes you happy to do so. So happy to see Jeffrey living his authentic self he seems genuinely happy too without all the BS of LA he’s thriving yesss. Anyway thank you thank you 🙏
Oh my GOD, I had so many different emotional tears, Happy tears, sad tears, what if tears, and OH MY GOD tears... so many thoughts went through my head; how awesome your friendship is, how brilliant and epic the conspiracy launch was, what could've been if you both continued on the same trajectory, but how you've both come through this positively and grown so much and your friendship is still strong... I really, really REALLY HOPE you launch the second palette.  I watch YouTube more than I watch TV, I actually cancelled my Disney+, amazon prime subscriptions, and I haven't taken up paramount+, I only kept my Netflix. I also deleted ALL my social media and have not taken up TikTok, and it's been so great not being stuck to my phone scrolling.  I look forward to my subbed YouTube videos and I have regular channels I watch religiously, I prefer the YouTube Beauty reviews Jeffree does and I don't like these new 'Shorts' or 'Reels'.  So I really hope you release the second palette, and maybe a collection, you smashed the records for a collection release, and you would smash it again, and I would soo buy it all.  Sending you all Love and Blessings from Cornwall, UK 🙏🏻🤍🙏🏻
I watch it…. Lol
I love YouTube so I’d be so sad without it🥺
Jeffrees address is 6969 S. Star creek road
I come to watch ryland & Shane every week! Lol
omg not the gun
If you take anything from this video- let it show you that everything most people online tell you is going to make you happy and what is “cool” is not fulfilling! Also both Shane and Jeffree moved to states that are “freer” and less egotistic. Wonder why they are happier there?
Weird ending, just seemed like a strange place to cut. It just didn't feel like a natural ending to the video.
I still watch YouTube and all of the people I love watching are quitting or posting like once a month which isn’t enough to keep coming back…. Grateful you’re still making vids!
I have enjoyed this second part so much. is the second time I watched lol. It feels good to see you guys thriving after all the things that have happened. This reminds me that no matter what happens in life we just need to continue to go forward with my head high. Sending many blessing to all of you!
The music choices and timing/editing slaps in this
YouTube is all I watch
Shane... 1) make a paranormal series we would all ❤️ that soooo much! 2) We NEED the pallet ASAP! 3) We love you and your creative gold with every series you  put out I am always on pins and needles waiting for the next episode ,I could watch hours of this and still need more ! Basically you are amazing and some of us love you and Ryland and everything you do so thank you ! ❤️
Jeffree is such a leader
That is the sad truth about youtube. it's all about tiktok type videos, people just want content in shorter forms. I still watch youtube everyday, but it is slowly dying out and theyre trying to do things to keep it alive, and it's working for now, but who knows for how much longer.
I think to anyone part of this zeitgeist where Shane and Jeffrey got canceled, we have shifted the kind of content that we want to watch. most of us grew up and also don't care about the drama that "shock value content" does because it does not really stick anymore. I feel like vlogs that do well are not so much about popularity but the vulnerability of the creator. people have their niches and know what they like which makes them feel good. jeffrey's right about "nobody cares" in that context.
You tube sucks now that it's not making u as much money and it helped create a community where you were canceled... yakin funny
Jeffree leaving YouTube will make me sad. I hate getting sucked into tiktok.
20 minutes in and I already love it ❤️❤️
getting to the end.. and i just.. awwwww    :(      i think being able to follow on your journeys is a privilege for sure, and if it doesn't bring you joy then of course its not an obligation. but you do (both/all) still have a loyal fan base that supports you and looks forward to your content. i know that i personally seek out you tube regularly for not just shane content, but the podcast, ryland, lizzie, jeffree, chris and everyone else in this circle, and it does bring me joy.  Its weird to say "i love you guys" cause obviously your all strangers.. but after so many years of following it does give the dedicated viewers a since of family and inclusion. i just know that know matter where your (any of your) journey takes you, you have a community here on youtube that will support it.
jefrey seems to be so much happier... and I feel like his voice deepened lmao. this and the first few series is gonna be pretty heartwarming to rewatch in 50 yrs or so
Omg jeffree and Shane ghost hunting is my dream content 😭
I missed y’all ❤
I actually laughed hahahahah
Love y'all
“No one watches YouTube anymore” JEFFREE I BINGE WATCH YOUR OLD VIDEOS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK! They are my favorite things to have on while I get ready for school and work! I have Shane’s videos from 5 years ago on my recommended page and I watch all of them over and over again! I watch every new video y’all put out! WYM?!?!
JESUS CHRIST! Had NO idea how much I'd missed and waited for this!  Never thought you'd be back! Thank you!
This makes me forget the outside world for an hour...thank you 🖤
A whole load of to do about nothing. Welcome to the new Shane documentaries. This is why no one's watching anymore. We're all still on YouTube...
The comments are way too positive to be legit, like even ignoring outside factors, its youtube comments.... oopa.
It is so good to see Shane & Jeffree together again.  It was sad to hear Jeffree say YouTube is dead, I will/do click on and watch all my favorite YouTubers videos!!!!
Jeffree became so humble. I really love this side of him. Some of us still watch YouTube. If YouTube would stop changing algorithm everyday then the creator wont feel that YouTube is dead.
Doubt they will see this but I would watch this new Jeffree(YouTube or TikTok). I loved his old videos and seeing his life but he looks sooo much healthier and happier in these new clips. I think as we are all getting older with them we are realizing the actual important things in our life’s and protecting our peace. Love the new Jeffree.
What Jeffree said at the end really hurt bc I am on YouTube everyday. I would rather watch real people I can relate to on YouTube instead of any of the other apps he mentioned, yes I subscribe to all of them but I am on YouTube 1000% more than those. This sux that they aren’t happy unless they get 30million views. That’s not realistic anymore but there are a lot of people who just don’t want to go on tik tok, I personally think there is too much going on. YouTube knows what and who i like and shows me when there is new stuff, I literally would have to look up someone every time I wanted to see if they uploaded a new tik tok every time. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Jeffry in Part 3, will start with YouTube no one cares anymore…. Not!!! Lol there will be a pallet from Shane Ryland n Jeffry💖
Omg I love seeing this new Jeffrey! And Shane you really are so happy now like it makes me so happy ! I loved your series from years ago and now this series! Ugh! Cant wait for the rest!
I love ryland "does the drama happen if you don't see it? I blocked everything "
JEFFREE DONT QUIT!!
I think Jeffree Is always a head of the trends. The YouTube, it was so accurate. Even looking at how many views this video got versus the first video is such a teller of how many people are actually watching YouTube
seeing my two favorite youtuber  in my hometown 🥺
I love traveling just not with Elton John😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
14:44  When the Conspiracy pallet released I was pregnant with my oldest son and had my husband, who by the way doesn’t care about makeup, using his devises to load the website too so I could get it. We had multiple cell phones and computers up to get that. And I still have mine :)
My heart hurts 💔 knowing he's leaving YouTube 🥹 I still watch it lol.
At this moment this video has 55k likes and zero dislikes 14 hours after upload.... That should say something for them.
I love the ad lol
My level of respect for Jeffree has skyrocketed. Well done my friend!
PLEASE DO A PARANORMAL/GHOST HAUNTING VIDEO WITH JEFFREE AAAAA LOVE U GUYS
Shane and Ryan do not go anywhere YouTube isn’t dead for y’all maybe others but you guys and Morgan and the pods I’m still watching we all are
Thank you for bringing us to Wyoming, really enjoy the warm vibe you guys bring. Lookin forward to watching the next one
Nooo…. I miss him so much already
I still love YouTube and it’s my comfort place
I’m still here 😂 I watch everyday ❤
What did Jeffree said about Jenna ? I'm asking because of the music being so loud.... 😭😭😭
Awwww, im gonna miss jeffre on here
Jeffree saying YouTube is dying is pure cope- the statistics do not point towards this. His videos don’t receive the same amount of views as they used to for reasons that are obvious- the various controversies. Rather than reflecting on why this might be, he’s taking the easy route by blaming the platform.   I love Jeffree’s content, he is a born entertainer and incredible business person but his lack of self awareness is pretty clear to see.
Again this editing, top tier. Love this series
Ryland might be the most unlikable person on this platform. Nowhere near the worst, just the most unlikable.
The giant silencer 😂
I'm proud of you jefree. You are definitely making good choices on your spiritual journey. ✨️ God loves you all. ❤️
I watch on YouTube sometimes, but there's so much censorship, that it's really hurt influencers etc that use it. Same with algorithms. I mostly use Instagram for influencers and sometimes fb. But hate tik tok, so don't really go on there. I think social media is dieing in a way though. I think there needs to be something new and not censored and built better than fb and IG. I do like watching these series on here though.
1:24  "oh...." "OH..."  lmaoooooo
SHANE, YOU BEST NOT LEAVE ME BOI 😭😭😭😭
I love YouTube so much especially for Jeffree, Shane and ryland omfg 🤯🙈😔😔🥺🥺🥺
My wind down every night once kids go to sleep is bing watch YouTube for few hrs. I sleep with something playing when doing cleaning it's playing in background .it's not dead
I still watch YouTube for fun. I love YouTube. ❤️
Shane please don't pull a Jeffree and quit YouTube it would literally devastate me I have been watching you for so many years that you feel like part of my family and your videos make me so happy I don't know what I would do if you permanently stopped making videos. It sucks Jeffree is quitting because I have been watching him forever too it seems like all the YouTubers I love are leaving the platform and the new YouTubers stepping in just don't hit the same.
I love YouTube tic toc is a FAD.
I still come here to watch uploads from the old school YouTubers 😭 I'm closer to 30 now and watching these guys still takes me back when I was 14 and watching their og videos! Please don't stop ):
Y’all HAVE to do another series of ghost hunting with Jeffery in Wyoming !!!! Like seriously!!!
Shane. I've been watching you since I was 10 or 11. I'm 22 now. I just wanted to thank you for being at every stage of my life, canceled or not HONEY
Low key excited to see how he gets his high quality tiktoos
Awww jeff was like funny today I loveeee ittt
YouTube dying is very depressing between cancel culture, and community guidelines, monetization. A lot of creators are over it.
TikTok has been YouTube’s biggest demise.  I hope YouTube gets a wave of popularity back! Not all of us are pleased with 30 seconds of fun 😂
Luvvvvvvv ❤
LA really is toxic. You guys look soooooo much better now!!!
It saddens me to hear him say no one cares. Hi I'm here I still care and find so much enjoyment out of watching YouTube especially of Shane and Jeffree. When we sit down at night we DO open the YouTube app on our TV. It's definitely not dead. I respect his opinion and decision to move on but I'll still be here. I'm sad to hear this.
He's right look at the views on this video
I happy to see that Jeffrey is a healthier version of him self. I cant wait to be able to get peace like that for my family.  The housing market is so expensive it seems impossible.
Me : yup yup  that's jeffree ... ✨️🌟🌟🌟🌟✨️
Jeffree and Maddie walking into the airport like2 bosses….. Stan
Missed your editing skills 🥲
Jeffree overdid it with the palettes… the amount of them that came after conspiracy was crazy, like half of them i‘ve never even heard of
good for you chris still wearing your mask omg muah muah muah
people hate Jeffreee, i love that bitch 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️🫶🏻
Jeffree Star genuinely seems so much more happier, more himself, I have never seen him like this before and I love it so much. It makes me sad he is quitting YouTube, but I don’t blame him. Unfortunately, YouTube is dying to many older YouTubers because of cancel culture. We lost some great people I grew up watching, Shane Dawson (though he came back thank god), Jenna marbles, now Jeffree star. 😔❤️love all your content Shane, this series brings up nostalgia for me, can’t wait to see what you do next
Its wierd.. I can't find a single thing to compliment about this video. it's just all so bad
Omg can we pleeeeeeeeeease get a ghost hunting series with Jeffrey in Wyoming!!!
My old ass sitting here thinking damn who am I gonna watch now if everyone is leaving YouTube 🥺😭😭 On another note Jeffrey in his cap and tracky is looking hot 🔥 🥵
Leaving this video sad … really sad.
When jeffree said he’s quiting youtube soon, i cried 😢😢 been his fan since myspace days. I was so happy when he started his YouTube channel many years ago cuz i can watch him with his craziness (in a good way ofcourse). Instagram & tiktok arent the same because i like longer duration videos of him.
So up set with the fact Jeffree would quit youtube
We still love you Shane and jeffree
Can we just talk about Shane’s sick playlist thooooo ✨✨✨
Go off, give us nothing
Boring
🎉
So glad they are finally back together. Shane and Jeffree always made me feel like I was part of their venture. And this is no different. They both seem happier than ever. This makes me happy 🖤
Thanks for an amazing episode. Seeing the evaluation of all of you is great amazing. Thanks for sharing it. Love need jefree
What happened to the RETIRED title??...
maybe not for Jeffree but it's alright
I missed this.
but I watch YouTube daily
“Just not with Elton John” 💀
Anyone with eyes and ears can tell that Jeffree's heart hasn't been in YouTube for a long time. I'm sure he'll be doing stuff here and there, he still has a cosmetics company to run but he can do that without having a camera following him all over the place.
youtube is not that dead tho idk. i still use it daily
the pallete?! where is itttttt! oomgg. Should ne called Cancelled hihi. I care. I only see youtube. :(
I definitely prefer watching on YouTube 😬
Yassss❤
I grew up watching you guys on YouTube and also Jenna and it makes me sad all of the OG creators are leaving YouTube I still watch YouTube every day it’s part of my routine and it sucks that all you guys are leaving. So glad Jeffery is doing what is going to make him the happiest but it is still sad. And Shane was literally the first YouTuber I ever watched on YouTube and I’ve been through all of the stages of his videos and have loved all of them. I really don’t want YouTube to die
I just feel like TikTok is the number one platform rn so it’s hard competing with that. I want Jeffree to be happy and he already Doesn’t really post that much on YouTube anymore. But it dose make me really sad if he does decide to quit YouTube. He is the reason I become obsessed with make up. His make up reviews are always my favorite and I know I could trust his opinion. And looking forward to new make up launch videos. He will be missed if he leaves 🥺 but I do understand why he would want to. Either way we love you Jeffree ❤️ and Shane ❤️ but please do a haunted series together in Wyoming! That would be iconic! Love you both! ❤️
''go to tiktok'' ? never !
I think the reason no one clicks as much on Jeffree's channel is because recently its mainly been just about the pallettes and people want his old content back
That was Really interesting.  Good for him to find what you like & enjoy & to stop trying to please everyone else in the endless pursuit of bull💩 that is social media. 👍
i watch your vids almost every time a new one comes out!! Please Jeffree DONT leave Youtube!! Please shane tell him ppl still care
I love Shane and Jeffries new lives and I think YouTube kinda is dead I’m only on here for Shane , Jeffree and 1 other creator. If Jeffree wants to quite YouTube go for it and just stick with make up
i appreciate Jeffree for who he is but oh my gif he brags and skites SO much about literally everything, it’s insufferable. i am eye rolling constantly. it must be so exhausting constantly needing peoples validation and it’s like a bottomless pit, it will never be enough. Sad
I've never seen Jeffree in true peace. Ever. It was always so clear to me and the general public that he was unhappy no matter how rich and glamorous his life was. I am so excited for this new chapter in Jeffrees life. He deserves happiness as much as everyone else. Fuck his past. I've done and said very problematic things in my life as well, unlike him I wasnt crucified for it in front of the world. Live your life Jeffree! Love the new life slogan "...So." ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not the clip of downtown Athens in GEORGIA when they’re talking about Wyoming 😂
In certain categories, yeah Youtube's dying.
Well I still go on YouTube everyday lol I don’t have tictock
Cannot say I didn't see it coming. It still hit me hard to hear it. I lived for Jeffree's content on YouTube!
I would love to live out there! As long as a grocery or some type of store is close enough!
I relate to Jeffree alot cause he's also scorpio and around the same age as me. I personaly don't have tiktok I'm scared I would get addicted to it. But it's thrue youtube is not what it used to be.
Shane in the first episode “his like that rich crazy uncle where your like ohh what’s he gonna do” then in this episode Jeffree pulls out a gun with his silencer on just casually 😂 Jeffree never disappoints lol
Seeing how even Jeffree mentions that Youtube is dying slowly made me realize that we really are shifting to a new erra. I mean, these past years have been crazy. Not only the content creators or the people but the media itself too. I realised that in these two years instead of watching youtube videos, I have been scrolling through my recommendations and subscriptions more than watch anything. It has changed and I agree on it "dying". My childhood was with all of you guys and this just gave me chills all through and on my body. A wave off sadness indeed, but I'm happy that Jeffree is full behind what he says and more confident and relaxed. Without realizing, I have already accepted that youtube is dying. I hope it won't cease completely, as I still have a few youtubers I love to watch.
Okay the title was definitely the retirement of Jeffree star for sureeeeeee
YouTube is my favorite platform. I gave up all social media this month and YouTube is the only thing I watch anymore. I wish the people I subscribed to posted more bc I never have anything to watch
He seems so at peace on the farm 😊
When Jeffree said "just know it feels so right,  because it's with you"... I felt that.... you can tell how much they care and trust eachother. So sweet
It’s lovely to see everyone so relaxed and happy. True friends just drop back into it regardless of time apart
Shane, you better not quit YouTube!😡
I absolutely LOVE your videos and series like this! The editing is actually so perfect it's like a movie. Can't wait for the next part Shane! ♥
Shane and Jeffree playing with a gun was horrifying omfg
y'all sure forget all the shit these ppl have done huh
Wow truth really just hit me. Jeffrees right as much as I love jeffree he's right, even when I look in the 3rd person myself he's right ik not watching YouTube as much as I use too. But I don't know if I'm ready to let it go, but we all have to one day. 💚💚
Did anyone else cry when Shane and Jefree finally reunited?!? Just me? Ok, that's cool.. 😭😭😭 I Love this for both of you!
I LOVE IT
I loooove the Colorado/Wyoming vids cuz I’m born and raised in northern CO but it kills to watch people live out your entire life dream and casually say “it’s only a couple million dollars” 😂
I honestly haven’t been a huge fan of Jefferee star in the past but I really appreciate his growth now. Providing for his community in ways that I’m sure is needed so there’s more food recourses. And same with Shane, it doesn’t feel like I’m watching videos that are mainly there for stupid comedy, or talking about drama all the time.  They’ve both made major changes in their lives to live something more positive and made channels that really draw me in way more than they did before.  I’m honestly not so surprised about what Jefferee said, I think it was a long time coming, but he knows what’s best for him, and considering social media and attention all the time of any kind isn’t his drive any more honestly makes me wish he would stay on YouTube longer than two more videos. (Sorry if this is a spoiler to anyone) I feel like now I’m able to connect with the way that he does things right now, and the fact that he’s letting the Yak’s live out their lives and letting them die humanely, and breeding them for the community so that people can have their own means of making money or a way for food is honestly really admirable.  I’m surprised, yet not surprised.  They’re both doing great in my eyes.  People are free to their own opinions, but I think that they both really put in the effort and the work to become better versions of themselves :)
love this & love them!
I care , some loyal followers are still here
Short of the occasional movie with my kids my entertainment comes almost solely from YouTube, with that being said you have to do what you have to do for yourself whatever that might be because whatever your life or any other person's life becomes I'm not going to have to live with it somebody else isn't going to have to live with it so if something like YouTube isn't working out for somebody anymore personally in the grand scheme of their life I could totally understand not doing it anymore.
I love your videos so much, I need them in days that’s not so easy! I cracked up when you called Ryland Elton John omg 😂   I just hope you guys know you do have a lot of support from many fans all over the world, just saying I fricking hate cancel culture 🥲❤️   Also just wanted to say I’m so happy for Jeffree doing so good 💕 I’m so into paranormal stuff I was so curious when he mentioned the hauntings there 😱 I’d love to see videos like that haha. Sad to hear he’s quitting youtube though because I love his videos 😢
It’s so nice to see the two of you enjoying life and being your true selves ❤
But Jeffree.... we are watching THIS on Youtube😭😭 I will always watch yourube!❤❤❤
Honestly, if jeffree quits youtube, i will miss him so much
I hate tiktok
I used to watch Jeffrey, these days I watch Rylan, Morgan and a couple of other you tube channels... I was excited for this combo of Shane and Jeffrey too, I am here for it, I love Jeffrey's humour, living 😍
Wow and wow. so enjoyed this, thanks Shane
noooooo i love youtube its so much better then tiktok. Like i just feel so much better after watching youtube for an hour then if i've wasted time on tiktok. I want tiktok to get banned so that youtube can make a comeback
Does everyone remember back when Shane asked Jeffrey to make him rich? Well he did. Now we got two rich men talking about how millions of dollars living on that ranch is very reasonable.  It all just sounds insane.  If Jeffrey didn't care about the money then he wouldn't be quitting YouTube.  That fact that he is saying YouTube sucks and the views aren't there and doesn't mention that it's his fault ? Whatever to all of this.
it’s so sad hearing Jeffree say he’s leaving youtube we truly gonna lose an icon and someone i enjoy watching :(
If you go out Jeffrey you better go out with a bang💥BABY❣️
Yeah... I don't like this. He's wrong. It's one thing if he's not enjoying it and wants to quit but to say that an entire platform is dead when it's absolutely not true it's completely out of touch with reality. Just because he's not getting the views doesn't mean no one is
I honestly don't relate to a single thing Jeffree said at the end. About how streaming services have taken people's interest away from YouTube. YouTube is a place where you can find unique, consistent, and specified content to your interests that's constantly evolving, for better or worse. I watch something on a streaming service maybe once a month, if that, but YouTube is my daily hobby. And I live for Jeffree's videos, whether they be makeup reviews or brand announcements.
what jeffree said at the end about youtube is so true and sad, i dont know whats happened to it i dont know iof its because of tiktok but youtube is so dead at the moment
So cool to see all of this!! I don't think Jeffree quitting YT is surprising but it's saddening because of the 'end of an era' feeling. I still very much watch YT every single day and I do not use TikTok. My main content was the beauty community but I've been watching a different community for a while. I don't think I've been watching anything in the beauty community for about 2yrs. So for Jeffree this probably seems like the next logical step if he feels that viewership has moved. I'd be wayyyy more shocked if Shane quit since I don't believe his style of vids would suit TikTok or any other platforms so I think it's just a matter of different communities on different platforms. But both of them seem happy with where they are at and that's all that matters. I doubt Jeffree will take down the channel so it will always be there and he will still very much have an online presence, just somewhere else.
Think Jeffrey shouldn't say that YouTube sucks now because  Might not. Be the same but she gotta remember where she came from   and how  big of a platform YouTube was in her career and her makeup line ... ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
I love YouTube though 😱😭😭
I want Jeffrees hat!
I still absolutely love youtube and really miss all the original youtube no longe making content or as much content🤍
Jeffree looks so genuinely happy! We all need to go live in the middle of no where to find our inner peace lol. So happy for him 🥰
I'm so poor, I didn't know gates could open like that in front of your house 😭
I still watch 😫
Jeffree quitting Youtube will be such a loss to a really big community. He's the one who started everything. It's really sad but if that will make him happy then why not. He can live his best life however he wants.
I watch YouTube for enjoyment! I come home and watch it all the time it’s my evening watch your videos and loads of others
Is it hyped like it once was? Maybe not but we’re still watching. Those who matter! Your fans! We’ll watch anything you’ll post. Maybe transitioning from beauty into more personal or vlog style maybe would help. But either way we’ll support but miss Jeffreee. 😢
Thanks a lot you liberal cancel culture degenerates!
Jeffree can stop if his videos aren’t getting the same attention. But it’s a bit dramatic to say everyone hates YouTube now. Look at the numbers Shane gets on his last years worth of videos.  Clearly people are watching.  It’s just there are thousands of makeup videos and perhaps people are tired of that?   Don’t listen to him Shane. Keep going, we love your creativity.  You too Ryland and Morgan!
Gotta say I love the grounded Jeffree he seems so calm.and free.
Can Shane & Jeffree bring back YouTube? ❤ I don’t want jeffree to leave 😢
We're still here on YouTube and we still care I watch every video Jeffree puts out
NOOOOO jeffree stay please !!!! we love you ❤❤
I can not get over how calm and well you both look! That big sky ticket is a good thing.
Youtube is STILL my life. Every day. Please don't leave.
Amazing to see them together again as if nothing has changed but both are in so much better spaces.
Please come back again with your series.... you are so funny!!!!!!
Jeffree saying No one cares about YT anymore.?? And yet this 12 hr old YT video already has 53k likes and 800k views. Uhmmm…..beg to differ my dude.
Nobody goes to YouTube for the beauty content anymore but we are here for the real life stuff like vlogs and just hangout and chat. The beauty channels are just dead.
this series is curing me from depression
Jeffree is actually quite handsome here. More attractive than he’s ever looked before. Wyoming looks great on him.
I don’t feel like they was cancelled lol. If they kept posting we’d all keep watching.
Love you Shane ❤
YouTube is still my favourite longform content to watch! Nothing feels comforting and personal than watching your favourite YouTubers, especially ones you've been watching for years!! This video had me absolutely gripped, it was amazing Shane❤️
Shane: “I don’t think I’ve ever been so much with a person” Ryland 👁👄👁
20:50 literally Fuck you Assholes who makes those Tiktioks about Shane. How tf can You do that to a Person and still Feel sane afterwards?? I hope you Scroll on Social media all day and Feel absolutely miserable About Yourself
So sad when this ended! I could watch for hours and these bring me such joy! Can’t wait for part 3!!!
The way I literally just burts into tears @ 52:58
Shane changed the Title of it 😂 idk why bc you would get more clicks with the last one
no im obsessed with his videos , i click , i watch , i still care about youtube and jeffree quiting is the end of an era
I love Jeffree but it felt REALLY out of touch with reality when he said no one watches or cares about YouTube anymore when he gets over a MILLION views on nearly every video he uploads….
Please don't stop YouTube. Or let me come hangout for a day! I can't walk great but I would miss your content so much!
Shane is so right for thinking he's making a big mistake ! SO MANY youtubers love doing youtube, so many with way under a milion views subscribers and they go on. Jeffree has over a milion views on every single video and he literally says no one cares to see his videos. hahahahaha so very ungrateful !!!!
such fun series but very true what Jeffrey says at the end, nowadays even Instagram is dead many influencers were devastated when they started to push the "reels and tiktok trend" as Jeff said is a bit empty thing to do not bringing too much "educational" content
I’m sorry but jeffree is wrong when it comes to watching YouTube. My joy everyday is coming onto YouTube and watching my favourite subs new videos. I don’t even watch Netflix as much as I watch YouTube.
I watch yourube every day
I would love to buy land in a place like Wyoming.....but I know people my color aren't really welcomed
Youtube makes me feel like im still a kid in a way its nostalgic , but what jefree said its true😢
im begging you shane don’t also quit youtube. your literally one of the last og youtubers 😭
I live on YouTube i dont have tv or cable... Guys you cant leave us too we lost way to many of the ogs and fav youtubers.. I love seeing the happy shane and jeffree I live for it.. So happy that even after the cancelations everyone's thriving and living their best lives. This authentic content is all we ever wanted. Don't fuckin leave us... That's really upsetting.
The timeline jumps are super confusing 🥴
So he just gonna do makeup reveals on IG???
Jeffree, No one watches beauty videos anymore but i would watch your adventures🥹 i think you should just change your content and be more real on youtube (btw you’re the realist person but it only shows on shane’s vids) much love💋💋 Ps: love you shane and ry
So happy that you're doing these types of videos again!!!
I watch youtube every day, i dont wanna lose my fave creators😭
I am living for this!!!!!!!
It is so great to see you two back together a true friendship in this crazy environment
A lot of us still love YouTube and come here in the morning and at night. It may not be the numbers you’re used to but there’s millions still
Shane, I love you but these episodes are way too long for the actual content that they have. They could be 30 minutes shorter. I get that you want to get the revenue from ads but it's hard to stay engaged with all the flashbacks and super long introductions.
This is everything!! Great job - both of you! 🙌🏼
I'm so sad that Jeffree is leaving Youtube 😪
I really wish all the negative stuff didn’t  happen with Shane and jeffree I’ve been such a long time fan of both but this doc is just not the same as the others , doesn’t hit right , I hope y’all sell the palette cuz I’ll buy it but so disappointing I got SO excited for everything they did together now it seems unimportant to me :(
Omg! Didn't expect to hear that! Say it isn't so!!!
Shane holding the gun I am DYINGGGG 😂
This is absolutely beautiful!!! Welcome to the peaceful country life.
Jeffree is leaving the beauty world or closing his YouTube channel.
I love that Jeffrey is not afraid of outgrowing things, he is grateful for a moment but he’s also happy to sell things and let go. It’s so fucking healthy cause we are always changing and evolving, shit happens and we become different to who we were. I need to start letting go of things more.
I’m still watching 🥺
I’ve been watching Shane and jeffree from the beginning, love them! To hear jeffree say he’s gonna stop YouTube broke me 😭😭  Love you Shane
20:33 gave me the ick wtf why was that so unnecessary 😖
I’m so proud of them all, Seems that Jefferey and Shane got to where they thought they wanted to be afew years back but everything unfortunately went badly for them and they’ve both really came back with a vengeance, Both so in tune with what they really want now and you can see true happiness in them now, So beautiful to see:)
Please start paranormal investigations together omg *-*
I fucking love the Shane Jeffree collabs, I’ve missed you both so much. I’ve made too many mistakes in my life to ever judge somebody else, I’m just grateful to see you both looking happy and enjoying life ❤❤❤❤ Ps: still have and love all your palettes
Made me so sad that Jeffree actually wants to quit youtube :(
If u quit Jeffree i swear to god ill dieeee..........
Jeffree looks so much happier and at peace. I'm gonna miss his videos tho 🥲
Yes paranormal stuff! Oh please Shane please do more vampire videos! And ghosts ! ❤❤❤
I love YouTube and always will
So many people do still watch and do still care! I still love Youtube and watch a heap of content on it!
I think they fail to mention that one potential reason views went down could be the whole drama situation and people falling off the wagon. I used to watch Jeffree all the time and then stopped as time went by with all the bs; but not only because of the drama, beauty content went from product reviews to pr unboxing, so as a consumer I no longer get the information I used to get 5 years ago- what products work, actual make up advise and tips, how-tos, etc. That completely disappeared so I have no incentive to watch, I get nothing out of it. I also think whats happened is that the audience matured and people who were in their late teens or early twenties just outgrew the content, while the teens now dont really know these influencers and are on tik tok.
I love YouTube! ❤I still watch videos of Shane and Jeffrey so yes we’re still watching! Don’t believe the lies hun your not cancelled not in my book! Cancel culture can go F off! ❤
❤❤❤❤ I love you both and Ryland and I still love YouTube❤❤❤❤
Im still watching YouTube! I love  vlogs and stuff, post good content and people WILL watch
got a notification that it was called the retirement of jeffree star.. anyone else or am i just high
bored
I love Jeffree XD
Hate to say this, but I feel like you need to change either your camera or the camera man. It's so shaky!!! 😭
A dinosaur and a giant turtle
Look jeffrey... I watch you tube every day. And I have been waiting for your adventures and reviews... im sad to hear that you want to give up on us.... have a great life. Loved you while I had you... shane!!! Don't you dare!!!! We just got you back!!!! Rylan!!! Don't you dare either!!!!
Don’t leave me 😢 Jeffrey, Jenna, Shane, Joey, maranda, Gabbie I could go on. We came here for you guys because we found like minded people. We are with you
You and Jeffree have been greatly missed! I love your podcast but you and jeffree together is amazing!!!! ❤
OMG !! If you both were to release that palette, of course you both should name it the  CANCELED palette.
-
So happy to see you guys visiting Jeffrey again. I love how you guys are all best buddy’s. One day I would love to meet you guys . Sadly I live in the uk so prob will never happen
Anyone else a little disappointed with this part? 55 minutes long and we saw them essentially land in Wyoming and drive to the house 😅 I was hoping for a tinyyyy bit more given we have to wait a week each time.
Jeffree’s strong opinion of YouTube isn’t everyone’s. The look on Shane’s face I feel like that comment hurt him. Keep creating the content you know & love Shane ❤
So the 19.5 million people who watched this are no one…? I like Jeffrey but I don’t watch his videos often bc they got boring but I watch Shane and ryland almost daily
Honestly, views may not be the same as they were for whatever reason. Who knows, but everyone watching Shane and Jeffery now are faithful supporters through and through 3. Million of us are no less loyal, ride-and-die subscribers and love you both.
When I seen the blue horse I thought you was gonna go off on a Denver airport conspiracy 😂
YouTube is my escape from my own reality! This made me sadddddd. 😢
I love their friendship
i am so happy you guys are back❤
Jeffree doing a realistic day in his life and vlogs would be so cool
You saved my life I f.cking love you
It's actually a great move from Jeffree tho. The world's economic status is dooming, living in the countryside and having a farm is a great idea. In the end, people need food. He knows what he is doing...
Oh how I have missed shane's series
Jeffree’s energy is iconic 😂 the airport moment has me smiling ear to ear!
i love love love this. i always did bc it makes me feel like im right there with you guys and we are having so much fun. lol that sounds sad but you really make us all happy
I still come to youtube, but for things I actually care about.
So excited ♥️
Eating animals in 2022 is plain crazy. I'm not buying anything from Jeffree. He's making money on somebody's blood.
This is my favourite ok this two together from the beginning is everything the way they support eachother is love and the the way jeffry is living his life brings smile on my face rooting for this friendship here and can’t wait to see this two together till I m alive here on this earth ❤
i think what Jeffrey is sayig about the end of youtube is true. there are so many amazing series out there, and with those we cant compete. the only thing is what youtube is capable (and netflix etc cant) is that showing REAL people. cut the bullsht everyone, dont try to be perfect, show your real face and people will click!
This is so sad.. I still watch YouTube and support those I follow. It hit me to hear Jeffree say he is quitting YouTube bu I can understand his point. I don’t think YouTube is dead though.
Love you guys  So great for Jeffrey to know when to leave with class before the party ends. He is an icon. ❤️
Ok but when jeffree and shane came together again. Ah I missed this!!!
I still watch I look at Jefs channel all the time to watch videos
:(
We watch YouTube as our daily TV, we hardly watch any of the pay to subscribe players.  But I do think peoples tastes have changed and I have stopped watching make-up channels.  I also think that the younger generations are using Tik Tok rather than YouTube though.
Truthfully it's sad JS is quitting youtube, although he really only posts when he has something to sell so what is he really quitting. I don't blame him though with everything he has going on in his life and youtube just isn't the same as it used to be, but I am on it every single day watching a lot of people! I'm just glad it wasn't Shane making that announcement. I would be so sad!
Just so you know i still watch yt! ❤
we need a paranormal video in wyoming
I still watch YouTube. And so do the people that care about you guys. I literally watched Shane eating and trying out a bunch of random ass shit in the beginning of his YouTube career Lol. And now seeing how much hes changed and how much his life is changing for the better. Its Amazing to be apart of the journey. So YouTube will always and forever be that bitch. Period❤💀
People are on YouTube but not watching you and Jeffree because your content has become stale
Jeffree has changed ALOT, seems much more connected
Jefree: no one watches YouTube anymore  Me: 👁👄👁
I still prefer long form content and miss the pre 2020 YouTube. I'm over here watching Uncle Roger vids now.
Shane! Don't you dare get any ideas! You can't stop doing YouTube! 😅❤️
I still watch YouTube every day. You all are my favorite creators....
These are the videos that I live for💕
i LOVE youtube. I watch youtube everyday and night. I just dont gravitate towards beauty gurus.  I love shane & Ryland. I cant see youtube without Shane! If shane goes... ill go. I'll go wherever  he goes. lol
I watch you tube more than anything else. Now I feel more irrelevant. Sadness came across me. I'm one of those that does not like tic toc or other platforms. I need more than a WHAM BAM THANK YOU MAM.... FORPLAY IS ALWAYS THE BEST
Shane looks so good! <3
I am no one !!!! I come here for enjoyment every day. I love my Shane and my Jeffree and ryland Colleen Rachel. I have been here for a loooooong time watching and I will be very sad for anyone of you not to be here
I would totally buy a shane 2 palette for sure.
JS trying to cancel YouTube? 🤣  I still watch - a lot 🤷‍♀️
I just realized I’ve been following/watching you guys for damn near 15 years. I’m old 🥹
Lmfao I love that your jean jacket had a sweaty bunny 🐰 😂🤍
I haven’t laughed so much in aduch a long time. Love it when these guys get together
But but.. I've been watching Youtube for like 15 years now and I still  log on Youtube EVERY SINGLE DAY and watch videoes from a few Youtubers..  I've also been rewatching a lot too - even waiting for this new series, I went back and watches the old series with Jeffree; no one makes videos like that. So everytime Shane uploads, it's like a happy cry and I watch it just like going to the movies XD
I think Jeffree couldn’t be more wrong about YouTube. I think people are still watching but the focus has changed. I know for me I went from watching more beauty to now more home Reno’s/Vlogging videos. I think just the type of content has shifted and because it’s not in his wheel house he says it sucks. I think he needs to remember that without YouTube his makeup business wouldn’t be the empire it is today. Clearly the new Jeffree is not so new and changed. He should be greatful that YouTube was able to provide him a platform that enabled him to grow his empire. Instead he took what he needed from it and now he has nothing but negative things to say. That was pretty unfortunate to hear him say.
Im happy you both making new episodes I was waiting for this since you both have been canceled I hope you show everyone that you still can make this trend alwAys hope you keep on what you are doing we still love watching you guys never stop.
Nooooo I'm honestly going yo miss jeffrees videos r u kidding me
You tube isn’t great anymore ?😮 new to me NOW all the bs rules lost all the money and views it’s crazy I’ve never downloaded tic toc and never will like Jeffrey said everything is just to fast for our minds and getting such fast gratification good it takes away so much value it’s sad (not to mention the way our brains actually take information in and hold it ) Jeffrey I’m so proud of you  You are amazing and beautiful and everything you said truly inspired me and for real needed to hear all that right now ✌🏼
i missed jeffree and shane sm 😭
I still love YouTube ❤️
He’s saying no one is watching YouTube… completely untrue, look at the millions of views on new videos. Numbers don’t support his viewpoint. Just because TikTok is popular doesn’t mean people will leave YouTube completely. Numbers don’t lie.
Yeah I still come on here.. I love YouTube for the podcasts everyone is making especially. Also I love your videos Jeffree, I still support your makeup and everything you do. I will only wear your makeup because it’s the best!! You have so many true fans who do still care! I will follow you through anything you do.  Thank you Shane for this video I love you all so much and loved seeing the mix up of the throw back videos as well. Sending love! 💕💕
Everybody is watching you tube still. Just not jefree star unfortunately 😕
I loved the jeffree makeup reviews, they were quite entertaining, 😢sad to hear he won’t be doing them anymore. I think it’s a generational thing? I’m 32 now, and I still refuse the tik tok trends, and still like to see my faves doing long videos and hearing them speak
I still love youtube. Im still on it daily.
I know what Jeffries are about. I still watch YouTube and TikTok. I've just added another platform into my watching roster
Love you all and I'm forever greatful for your content (both Shane and jeffree) it truly got me through the hardest parts of my life
I'm still watching YouTube! 😅
8:47 Schrodinger’s drama 😂
I've been a fan over the last six years at the least during this time I've watched DRAMA go on with former friends of yours the make up pallet and the cancelation  also I've watch you live in three different houses we've met your mom and bother as well as Roland's folks your family started to feel like our family and not once did I ever turn my back on you because during my life's hardships you were always there and when you weren't your loved ones were like Jeffree I admit for a minute I unsubscribed from his channel only because I felt someone should have stood by you Shane. But later when you said you guys were still friends I subscribed back to his channel.  YouTube isn't dead we are here we aren't going anywhere I am a fan of Jeffree not because the make up or his money just because he seems like a good person who has had issues and dealt with them the best he can no one is perfect I hate to see him go, but if he is thank you jeffree for the entertainment.
Correction: no one clicks on JEFFREES videos anymore, this doesn't mean youtube is dead
Jeffree don't leave youtube 🥺 youtube is so boring now without you guys
Loved this made me sad jeffree doesn’t want to do YouTube anymore I loved the videos so much people care u guys filly day with joy in my life love you guys there are people that care about you even if u think they don’t 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I guess I'm the last who still winds down and opens YouTube? I hate tiktok. I only get stuck on YT shorts and reels if I'm ever on Instagram...and I hate getting stuck. It's bizarre. I'm screwed...
YouTube is NOT dead! I watch videos everyday! Don’t ever stop
Leave a like on this comment if YouTube is still very much alive in ur heart!!!
"This feels so right because it's with you" Jeffree really trusts and loves shane🥲
That fucking song😵😵😵
So exciting to see you guys..I saw Shane and Jeffree grown up so much..but when you guys meet..it's like highschool reunion..FYI..I still watch your videos from 2-5 years ago over and over..love u guys so much..Shane ❤️Jeffree ❤️
After watching this twice now I've come to have even more respect for Jeffree, his business mind and creativity, and the way he values his life and the people around him. He came from nothing yet has experienced so much more in his short life than many would ever experience in a lifetime. It's so awesome seeing Shane and Jeffree together again. I really hope Jeffree doesn't leave youtube as it's still an amazing platform. Even if we can just keep up with not only what he's up to but how he's doing as well. There are still a LOT of people who still love Jeffree including me! This was so  awesome getting a glimpse of Jeffree's life post LA. ❤
So happy shane is back on YouTube! Been watching him since the start and he gives me so much life
I'm actually really digging the more masculine natural look Jeffrey has going on when he isn't made up in full makeup....and his natural brows completely compliment his face, much better than ANY drawn on ones ever did...
YouTube is very much still alive for the new generation, it's just that the views go toward gaming videos, gaming YouTubers, Vtubers, educational videos and tutorials on coding, digital art, using programs like blender, mmd etc etc. It is the older generations that are abandoning YouTube for a more peaceful drama free experience by watching TV shows and series etc, but the younger generations are still here, they just watch other stuff, the makeup world doesn't interest them, vlogs don't interest them, they like memes, games, anime & other stuff that I can not remember at the top of my head. The celebrity drama, makeup obsession and vlogging era is over and YouTube has migrated towards niche videos to suit individual tastes.
I freaking love the new jeffree, so Happy 😊 I love it ❤
youtube is on it's way out in 1st world countries just like facebook. everything is so fast paced in there that people's attention span has drastically shorten. not everyone has the interest to waste their time on ever single thing. and i can understand that very much.  however, these apps are still very popular in other regions like SEA for example. i'm from philippines and facebook is still very popular here, same goes with youtube.
Bitch I'm shook I love YouTube, it's still my favorite platform to watch but I do understand what Jeffree means, most people are not interested anymore or not as much as they were used to
I’ve never felt so attacked for being on an app😂🫣
31:35 god im dead 😂😂😂😂
Jeffree literally threw Shane under the bus years ago and Shane is still doing documentaries about him, it just shows what kind of person Shane is. It's sad because I used to love Jeffree and have been following him since the myspace days, I bought tons of Jeffree's merch from concerts, hot topic, and makeup line. This is just sad, But I wish him the best.
This made me super sad. 😥  Im still here hourly-daily-weekly watching y'all on you tube. Please don't leave us.
The arcade should be called the star-cade
Jeffery pulling the gun out 😂
I watch YouTube the most. I don't do TV anymore. It's on YouTube mostly to get the info & see so many places, people, news, & so on. I see a lot of people turning away from tick toc.
wow this shit hit so hard i miss y’all fr
The last part hits hard. There are still many sides of YT that's still popular up to these days but it's also true that it's not as hyped as it was before. Still, hearing that Jeffree will quit feels really sad. The previous series was released when I was still in highschool, and now that I'm in college I still feel the memories and fun that I have from watching it, knowing the beauty and make up side on YT (even though I rarely wear any make up daily), etc. But, more important thing is I'm glad that you are in a better mental health, feeling happy and free from the previous toxic part of your life and I hope it keeps improving, either in career wise or personal things wise. Also, cheers to the new series. Definitely love the dramatic aspect in here, like everything is so fun and I actually found this series accidentally (thank you YT algorithm) right when I need a new series to watch. So excited for the next episode! A̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶r̶e̶l̶e̶a̶s̶e̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶p̶a̶l̶l̶e̶t̶e̶
I actually liked this
No jefree we need you in the YouTube era 🥺 Allot of us watch you. Tik tok isn’t the same as YouTube we see you in YouTube. 🥺
I’m literally crying y’all can’t quit YouTube is still my happy place I watch Jenna’s videos and y’all’s videos all the time still for years and years now on repeat
I’m so sad Jeffree is quitting 😢 but unfortunately I do kinda agree that YouTube is dying. It’s been harder to find content to watch compared to back in the day when there was so much & everyone was into it
WHAT THE F WHAT THE F WHT THE F WHAT THE FFFFFFFFFFFFF GUYS!!!!! I GET IT I DO BUT WHEN JENNA QUIT A PART OF ME LITERALLY DIED I AM WHO I AM BECAUSE OF LITERALLY YOU 3
When Jeffree said I’m done with YouTube i actually started balling 🥺☹️😢
Aw, I love YouTube lol. I actually can't stand tiktok. Maybe that is where it's at now  with this new generation, but I've never liked the idea of going with the flow of something just because it was popular. I'll always prefer to watch, to listen, to learn.  It is a shame, but I understand it when you've been doing it for so long and you're in a place where it's no longer something you go back to.   Meanwhile I wanna see the palette already! Lol can't wait until the next video.
Jeffery single handedly canceling you tube. BOOM
YALL CANT QUIT
….I go to YouTube for reveals 😢 I watch YouTube for enjoyment and because I care 😢
sad you say youtube is dead.  i still watch.  am i a loser?
Don’t quit! I love ur videos im just not entertained with Netflix or TikTok I always come to YouTube 😐😭 plz….. I love u Jeffrey & Shane 😔
32:30 this kind of driving is also super dangerous because a lot of deer and wildlife hang around the roads and if you hit one of them at this speed you can die or get severely injured!
Why did you change the video name ?
31:31 imagine if someone was crossing the road!! Super dangerous!
Knowing Jeffree wants to quit YouTube makes me a little sad. I hope he still does videos for his releases because it helps me really take in his products and know what I want and what I’m buying. But also knowing he’s healing and becoming more grounded makes me really happy. This is the last thing people would have expected from him but it’s the best thing for him
I still watch YT daily! And I click so fast whenever Jeffree posts a video. I miss his beauty videos. I bet if he posted more videos on him testing new makeup, and not palette launches, he'd be surprised with how many ppl watch.  I don't have tik tok and I honestly don't want it nor need it.
so true. YouTube fucked up this website with harming creators and cancelling ppl. now they become digital website holding of tvs production
What about a pregnancy makeup palette?
Omg noooo the end :((((
Wait I had to look up on Google when Jeffrey Stars birthday is. I'm Scorpio to and my son is going to be born a Scorpio.
Hahaha when Jeffrey said quitting YouTube, I heard “quick tooth” and so thought it was the name of the unreleased pallet  and thought what, that’s awful 😂had to rewind cos it didn’t make sense
In my opinion youtube is for the pros and older kids and Tik tok Is more just the eh....mediocre folks and now a days a bunch of small kids. I go there every now and then bc I see some of my fav youtubers using it but I really can't get myself to enjoy it that much.. I get too tired of it fast. I  don't think youtube will be the next vine or MySpace. Youtube is bigger than that and it's not dying anytime soon. Too much to do on here from shorts, medium lengths, longer forms, movies, now seeing Podcasters in person ect. Youtube will always be top priority for a lot of people regardless the fuss about tik tok...I'm confident enough to say...YouTube ain't going anywhere bc we are still here watching it but podcast are what's in right now. Podcast seem to be the next big thing on here so jump aboard Jeffree, if you want a piece of the next big wave. 💕
I stay on YouTube EVERY NIGHT. I watch podcasts only through YouTube because I like a face to the conversation. I’m shocked Jeffree feels this way!
Nooooooo Jeffree don't leave YouTube 😔 there are still a lot of us who love watching your YouTube videos.  I love all videos that Shane an Jeffrey do together ❤️
when next episode please
YouTube is like my T.V I watch it way more than Netflix. I love the both of you guys and grew up watching each one of you💕
i still love the old videos
No I love YouTube and your videos Jeffree and Shane. Will miss you.
Ending it with a paranormal 2 part series would be everything. Nothing but love an best wishes however they see fit for their futures💛💛 When I first started watching Shane couldn't be any more happy to find someone to relate on how the hurt that dwells within one's being an never ending laughter from dark humor ugh thank you so so so much for the content an life experiences you shared ❤️‍🩹 seeing how much you've grown as a human being has been such a gift once again thank you , you beautiful soul don't stop shining 🌠
Sad but Jeffree has a point, there was a time where I could spend a whole day watching all my favorite creators on YT. These days I only check up once a week or so to watch select creators for a couple hours. It’s just dry.
I’m sad about the leaving YouTube because I don’t watch t.v anymore because YouTube is my main source of entertainment.😢
I love watching YouTube. Being autistic youtube is one of the things I can reply on to help me settle down and smile. It’s a place I can go and watch something with real people and real interactions. I’ve watched it since 2012 and literally haven’t stop since. I don’t plan to anytime soon. I also don’t watch drama stuff because it’s too negative and biased opinions. I came here for a smile and enjoyment not another sprinkle of depression
WOW OMG!!!!!
I love seeing them together and i used to rewatch the old series so much bc it brought me joy, but now seeing Jeffree talk like this makes me so sad to turn back and look at the past 😔
content for the gullible. throw your hard earned pennys at him, foools $$$$$$$
I still watch YouTube religiously 🥹
I'm on youtube everyday. Its my happy place honestly. Kinda sad that tiktok and quick instant gratification has taken over. I'll always love YouTube, especially since I can rewatch old videos and reminisce on the joy I felt when I first watched them.
I'm so happy Shane is back making vids like this! 👏🏽❤️🥰
I only watch stuff on YouTube so I hope Shane and Ryland don't quit next
everyone looks so happy and healthy, i miss them hanging out together ❤
“They’re like little yaks” 😂
when Jeffree said, “it launches this November” I WAS SO READY FOR IT 😂😭 like please release it 😩
how come all his cameramen have annoying aah laughs. I CANT
I just fucking love Jeffree
Just passed the gun bit and I’m wondering why is it off safe lmao 😂
🌍
Be careful with where you put the gun it can easily roll behind the brakes and cause you to not be able to press it! Never put anything near the driving area or around people have died that way!!
omg this ending Noooooooo, dont leave me hanging .....Love that this serie is back <3
I'm on YouTube every night I got rid of cable lol
I really don't think that YouTube is dead, I just don't think that it's Jeffree's thing anymore... I watch YouTube almost every day and I enjoy it very much! Especially this kind of series (Ryland's channel too). 😊❤️
Ugh i still watch and love YouTube so much. Don’t leave us. You bring so many people so much joy!!
NO ONE CAN CREATE CONTENT LIKE THIS! SO HAPPY YOU ARE BACK!
I still come to watch my favs on yt and I deffo miss jeffrees content but not a big shock tho. But please don’t you and ryland leave!  It is getting harder and harder to find good new content to enjoy on here tho
fkn hell Shane, the vibes on these videos is impeccable. I remember how excited I was for the first series and every. fkn. episode. I feel it again, even more, the nostalgia and excitement. You really are outdoing yourself. Thankyou for making this new series, I'm in love
I understand why js leaves yt but i am sad 😭 i am one of those who watshes still ALLLLL the videos and i love to see shanes and rhylands vlogs and series. Please do not stoppen it 🥺🥺🥺
Missed seeing you both together ❤ my comfort videos 🥰 I love you Shane !!
I must be 1 of the few remaining people who love YouTube. I’m going to miss seeing Jeffree’s videos, a lot. I do understand the need to move on to something newer and fresher though. I loved the 2nd part in the series and can’t wait for the next one.
Shane you have lost all concepts of money. So has Jeffrey.  You think a million dollars is nothing. You say he lives in a normal house at 1 million dollars and He says that land is cheap like 1 million dollars.  Do you even realize that people work their entire lives and never make 1 million dollars???
Why did the title change?
This series is already so good !! We need moreeeeee
The last scene gutted me hard. It's so sad that nobody watches youtube anymore. Change is really inevitable and we have to live with it.
meanwhile all i ever go on is youtube.....
It definitely feels like YouTube has aged..
Jeffree looks amazing but….😢 I still watch. :( I still love YouTube and miss his videos :( this made me sad but I wasn’t surprised. I can’t jump on the TikTok wagon and it’s gonna suck not having him to watch
I still remember watching your last series together, and to me, that was the time of peak YouTube. It was so much fun to watch you do makeup reviews, talk about your life, or just go and be goofy. It reminded me that there is happiness out there and people who want to just have fun and enjoy the things they enjoy. If this series ends up being Jeffree's farewell series then while I am sad to see him disappear, I will watch and like all of the videos with the knowledge he didn't leave BECAUSE he was cancelled, but because he was ready to retire. He continued on afterwards, then said, you know what, the writing is on the wall and I'm done. To that, I say good for you. I will miss you, but I'm happy for you.
Hearing Jeffree say “im quitting YouTube after 2 more videos” made my heart drop I’ve been watching jeffree since middle school and im a college student right now🥺 but seeing how great his life is going and seeing jeffree and Shane together again make me so happy ❤️ I love the two when they are together❤️
No not another one of my Youtubers😢 literally none of the og ones are around anymore. As a millennial I’m dying rn.  YouTube is not dead! Not posting reliably and expecting the same views is crazy. We have trust issues please don’t abandon us Shane!!!!
How sad. I’ve spent 15 years of my life enjoying YouTube. This is still my go-to platform. TikTok is fun, but it’s such a blip into the lives of people I’m interested in. I prefer YouTube. I’ve been following you since JC… don’t you dare jump ship now, Shane ❤
Well now we know how he flipped his car! 🤦🏼 lol
Looking forward to the next episode!!!
i think shane is obsessed with being on Jeffrees dick 🤭
there is no youtube without Jeffree this broke me
OMFG!!!!!! I'M FUCKING LOVING THIS. Jeffree and Shane back together. Jeffree is suck an inspiration.
As a closeted guy, Jeffree your videos always gave me laughter and inspiration
I will never chose Netflix, AppleTv over youtube Jeffree❤❤
The fact that Jeffrey Star says in this video that he had 2 YouTube videos left to do and is still posting means that he is just talking crap. Also the fact that he gets 1 million views on each video and says no one is watching is a real slap in the face to the million that do still watch him. His true supporters.  He sounds so ungrateful saying YouTube sucks as we all watch this on YouTube.
Guys please you need to go to the Conjuring house!!
There's no need for a house that big 😰 makes me feel sad I'd much rather have lot of land and small house than vice versa cause I'd want to make a difference and have rescue animals, if I had even one spare room if be opening it for someone that needed it
I’ve been re watching Modern Family and Shane and Rhyland are so Mitchell and Cameron
Jeffree’s journey has always been inspiring. It shows that people can make mistakes, grow, change, and become better. He proves to us that success isn't the answer to everything, that there's more to life beyond ambition.
Pssh I have 1 neighbor! Ha
I guess because I’m older 66 that YouTube is my go to. I’m refuse to open a TicToc account. I hope Jeffree will reconsider but I understand.
Gone? Or gone as in a metaphor type of way where he's preparing for something new...? Hmmm.
Dressing to impress… my response “it’s Casper” 💀😂😂 I wish I could of met you Shane I’m a HUGE FAN
Some of us refuse to get those paid subscription services. Just big corporations getting more rich. I prefer YT. Stay with us Jeffries! Show us your new happiness. 😁
I only watch a handful of YouTube and Shane & Jeffree are at the top of the list. After what they all went through in the past I can't say I blame Jeffree for wanting to leave. Gonna miss it. Wonder how his launches will go in the future?
I'm sure mr beast would have alot to say haha
i literally can agree to jeffree. i think youtube is dying bc of every other app that has came out since the pandemic but also i can’t agree on where everyone stopped watching his videos. since you both have been canceled, a lot of people just agreed about what others have said about you guys and think you haven’t changed but in reality if they actually watch your videos, they can see how much you both have grown and know you guys made mistakes and learned from it. you guys are amazing people and it hurts to see that jeffree wants to quit youtube but if that’s what he wants, we should support his decision. he may come back later in his life but who knows, i just hope for the best for jeffree star and hope he lives his life to the fullest off camera 🫶🏽
You should name ur new pallete 'the cancelled pallete" 😆
so happy use all back together
JEFREE LOOKS AMAZING!!! he’s not even wearing makeup and he looks flawless. his skin looks so glossy and heavenly like WOWWW
Jeffree: "no one watches YouTube anymore" Me, on here daily: 👁️👄👁️
BABE?
I’m so happy Shane is making videos again 😭
I literally live for YouTube it’s my happy place. I watch YouTube more than I watch anything else. Makes me really sad Jeffree is leaving.   Also after 2 years I still wear my conspiracy palette every day to work couldn’t live without so thank you Shane & Jeffree ❤
I'm happy for Jeffree. I agree that maybe the main focus of people these days isn't youtube, but it's still my main form of entertainment and I'll miss him being on it.  But I get what he means.
We love a humble queen now 🙌🏼
I love YouTube ❤
I do!!!!!!
The culture of YouTube has changed so much it’s scary, I forgot just how much I missed old YT until seeing this. The problem is that we aren’t clicking because we are bored, we get the same isht in our suggested feed day in and day out it’s seriously over saturated the hype isn’t there anymore. I feel Jeffrey’s pull to move to a ranch and switch off more than ever, I’m burnt out after Covid, I’m bored and I’m sick of petty drama and just want to reconnect to the earth and switch off the frequency of everything
aint no way-
So sad wishing Jeff we would reconsider because I love watching them YouTube’s is something I search for 😢😢
There are plenty of people Still on YouTube....most people just aren't watching the same content as they used to anymore. Mainly because the economy is so bad, that watching people who live excessively while the majority of us are now struggling to just buy necessities just makes us depressed instead of being entertaining. It's also why the beauty community on YouTube has taken a massive dive....we just can't watch channels that keep pushing new products every 3 seconds because it's unrealistic to our lives. Want to Stay relevant? Change your content to reflect what's really going on in the world, then more people will be comfortable watching it. It's actually AMAZING that Jeffrey isn't going to be doing that anymore....it shows that he has grown BEYOND just selling products and makes him much more relatable as a person. I would give anything to be on a yak farm in the middle of nowhere during the madness in our country right now. Good for him!
Jeffree’s sense of humour is in its PRIME. I am living for Wyoming  Jeffree!
I’m on here daily, and I love Shane and jeffree, but if it’s what makes him happy, then that’s what matters. I would love to meet these guys 😭
I watch YouTube more than anything else.. not so much makeup stuff but lifestyle, vlogs, gardening and homesteading
As we are all watching youtube😅
Shane don’t stopp making YouTube videos. You’re the only reason I’m still on here
I love the new Jeffree wow! He's awesome ! Besides u an Ryland n family u guys are all my fav! Love the down to earth y'all have become
JEFFREE our here living his best dream ❤ | That’s goals. He seems so HAPPY.
Omg stfu. Love you all.   Babes
SO SAD that Jeffree is quitting youtube. I live for his youtube videos.
I gifted my conspiracy palette to my exes sister because it “ connected us lol but I needed it back so bad found it on Amazon paid too much but when it arrived I was sooooo happy it was like a piece of art a piece of history and this time I’m not letting anyone take it ! ♥️🤠🦬🌀🤍🖤🤍🖤 GuRL and was Jeffree free balling in sweats ?!!!
I’m scared of planes also 😅
Jeffree and Shane I just want to say, I care, I do want to be the person that begs you to release this pallet #2, that begs for you guys to not quit on yourselves and everything you have built. I’m proud of you so much and even tho it feels like no one cares about me either, I know there are people out there that do give a F and will reach me when the time is perfect because the universe has a plan. It may be what I envision or even better.  Thanks for letting me have a space where I have a voice. I just wanted to remind you all that YOU MATTER & I love you.  -janmichaelmua  One day I’ll be noticed and be able to reach my goals and go fuckign hard on everything.
Can you make a rumble channel???
I’m always on YouTube I prefer it then TikTok I just like watching a 30 minute video then a 1 minute and I’m just biased and hate TikTok😅
So much character development , I’m living for this . I’ve missed the content with them my heart is full now ❤
I love you Shane and I will always support your journey! <3
If not bringing joy remove it ... but honestly Jeffrey seem so at peace at star ranch I'm truly happy for him .  I wish him all the best.
I’m so happy to see Jeffree looking so down to earth and looking so happy thank you so much Shane for helping bring this to life omg I’m so proud of you for pulling your self out of the dark and back into the light !!!!!
Yes youtube had its peak and now its downhill and in few years we will remember it like mellenials talk about blackbuster
Oh gosh I love Shane and everything he does! 😭😁❤️
I clicked. 🥰I care.  💕I'm happy to see you here. ♥ And I know I'm not the only one.😘
Ok. So I’m only 3m20s into this video. Is “the big thing” (that Jeffery wants to talk about) setting up an OF for Shane?!
I was thinking to myself man, I must be old because I still watch YouTube Daily & thought I had seen all Jeffree’s videos & updates. Just checked his channel, nope. I’ve missed a bunch of his videos apparently! I never saw them suggested to me so I literally assumed he was still on his break. Now I’m sad :/
Shane always making me lmaof 😂❤
Jeffree is just everything ❤ I love him !!
I remember 2013 was the start for YouTube and it was good, I loved watching Pewds and all gamers on YouTube and of course OG ones but now I beraly come here. Because why would I watch YouTube if Tiktak gives you 15sec videos.
The suicide gate lol
I still watch you Jeffree, but I can understand the changes you're making to your life and respect your decision to leave YouTube, as do all of your true and loyal fans I'm betting. We hope you have the happiest (and most private) life you could ever wish for! ❤  Also, side note: Jeffree got HOT, holy hell. 😂
If Jeffree made ranch videos, I’d always watch them, as a closeted ranch boy, I find him and his yak ranch so interesting.
I will continue to watch all Shane, Ryland and Jeffree content on YouTube as long as the videos/podcasts keep coming. YouTube is my escape and it's so hard to hear Jeffree say noone cares and noones clicking... I am and I care lol!!!
Please never stop making videos. You light my day up everytime i watch you. It helps with my depression so much.
Actually teared up in the first 5 mins of this video. The jeffree x Shane era of YouTube was my favourite. I miss you both. I've lost Jenna Marbles and so many others already. Losing you guys would end YouTube for me. I know it's so #90skid #millennial but we need our people. We're all in this crazy world together. We love you shane
bro who tf cares about this Jeffrey guy what are you? his adverizer? jesud christ its sad to see what you became
Yes! I want a paranormal Shane and Jeffree series!
Loving this series 😍
I still watch YouTube daily and I'm really going to miss Jeffree.💔 I have watched him for so long and supported him though all the drama and I only wish him happiness.💖🌟
My heart DROPPED when Jeffree said he was quitting Youtube…  Not gone lie, I had been feeling that it was dying out (Even tho I utilize it daily)… It’s just sad because it’s not the same as it once was. The sad part is, the only ones I SERIOUSLY follow is Shane and Jeffree…   Jeffree I am loving this era. You may not see this but your growth is to be admired 💯❤️
OMG i miss the OG cast
Jeffrey please dont quit youtube I watched every single video of yours for 5 years straight but if u do i cant respect that but just want to send you hugs kisses and love 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm just gonna keep the mean comments to myself I love u so much Shane but he got to go 🙈🙈
omg why is it not next week already!!
you pick the best songs. . .
So we are not getting the paranormal content from Wyoming ....??
The YouTube is dying conversation is so short sighted. To be frank, just cause no one is watching you specifically, doesn’t mean the whole platform is dead or dying. Irrelevance comes for everybody at some point
I prefer long form content to short form, so I watch YouTube just as much as I used to. I don’t agree that nobody wants to watch it anymore. Great job on the series, Shane.
48:58 new concept for a palette? "So...?"
This was so entertaining I love you guys together it’s so much fun I really enjoyed this so much
Wait no I don’t want Jeffrey to leave I love this new him !!
TicTok is going to be banned from the United States because the Chinese are stealing people's data. So what then? I am disappointed.  I watch YouTube every day and Jeffrey still gets about 1 million views on YouTube videos.  He sounds like such a selfish rich man... saying no one watches me. Because those are his most loyal supporters that give him those views . He is so ungrateful.  Whatever makes you the most money Jeffrey. 🙄 I thought it wasn't about that anymore. Clearly it is. This hit me wrong. The ending ... it would be 1 thing if he had other reasons for ending his YouTube but its all about how youtuber sucks and the views aren't there meanwhile we are all watching this on YouTube. Just whatever.
We are still watching, we are still excited with you and Shane doing these.
YESSSSSSSSSSS ILYUUUUUUUUUU
Jeffree... Please don't stop YouTube.. I still love watching you 💔🤍🤍🤍 I also went from being a city girl my whole life and moved to the country in southern Idaho. I love it now, and I understand why you love it as well. It all comes full circle and I love you and your brand EVEN MORE!!!   Side note... I got a speeding ticket in casper 4 years ago 😳 it was on my first cross country road trip. Go figure 🤣
Jeffree is such a funny and entertaining person
Gonna say it: Jeffree, on this, is wrong. His channel might not be getting as many likes and views as before but I just started a channel here and it's doing well. And, I am on this app multiple times a day for my entertainment. If it's dead in Jeffree's world, that's on him.
Gates
why tf does he have a silencer??
This is so sad
Love how Jeffree included Chris. Sometimes it's hard fitting in with mutual friends that already have history and are established. That was sweet how he would bring him in and make sure he felt a part of the conversations too.
At the moment im at home with a burn-out, and this video made me happy. Its so nice, your friendship is so good to see. Thank you guys love you❤
I disagree with YouTube being dead. I use it daily and would be super sad if all the content creators dropped off 😕
This was awesome! Thank you all ❤
Jeffree says no one watches anymore yet he still gets a million views per video
Maddie is here.. OMG i miss her!!
ok i lost all my respect for jeffreey when he has started a farm where he kills animals : |
If Jeffrey leaves YouTube 💔💔💔
i love that Jeffree has found joy. The man he is today is 400 million miles away from the angry punk on myspace. shane is the same. if you cut all the scenes of shanes mouth hanging open as if he just arrived on earth...this video would be 20 mins long
Jeffrey can live in a shoe and make it fabulous
I'm still here and watching Shane!
Poor Yaks.
That’s so sad cause it was so much fun to come home and watch his videos and just have so much joy. But if he feels there’s not much more he can offer of content then I understand his view especially after everything.
This video is the best thing on any social media this year 🎉. So happy to see Jeffree and Shane colaborating again. And how both feel geniune happy and tranquil.
This is sooooo good!!! Omg the best thing I've watched on YouTube for some time. Loved it so much!!!
JEFFREE ALL GANGSTA PULLS OUT A WHOLE GUN 😭 IM STRAIGHT FROM THE GUETTOO YET HE GOT THE BOUJEE GUNS WE DONT SEE IN THE CHAIN
ok let’s home this isn’t boring like the last one
High key low key hoping for a palette surprise launch 😭😭😭
As a European it's so disturbing to see the obsession with guns. It's ffing disgusting!
I love how hilarious Jeffree is
❤️
You tube sucks made me laugh…I still watch it.😂
This was so so good. I wasn’t ready for it to be over. This video flew by. I’m very much looking forward to the next installment.
All I watch is youtube... I only watch tv and movies when my husband makes me lmao. I am so sad at the thought of my favorites leaving youtube. :(
Seeing his property from a different angle, like brub when he said he wanted peace and quite he was by kidding.
I just realised he’s moved himself to the middle of nowhere with 100guns somethings seriously spooked him (or he’s felt the need to lock himself down)
It’s sad to hear that Jeffree Star is leaving Youtube when I started when I went to your music concert when being a scene kid in middle school was everything in 2007/2008era
23:47 that’s not Wyoming that’s my home town
I’m so happy to be watching this but also so sad because I don’t want Youtube to disappear with all my favorite Youtubers like Shane, Ryland, Morgan, and Jeffree 😢 I’ve been watching for years and don’t want to stop
I will say... watching Jeffree evolve has been really interesting. I know a lot of people have different opinions about zodiac signs and personality traits along with it, but as someone who wants to understand people and their psyche/personalities/traits, I can tell he has evolved and matured. I myself used to be a troublesome Scorpio, I mean who hasn't had their immature years, But seeing myself grow and evolve, makes me realize how Jeffree has reached that point in his life now.  Besides that, even if he quits Youtube, he is still going to continue making money anyways, he is a business person, which is honestly the greatest move he made from content creation. It sucks that he wants to quit but if he truly made up his mind,  and him being a Scorpio?... he for sure will quit. I'm guessing he'll continue on TikTok instead,  expand more on his business and maybe show up once in a while on someone else's videos, probably Shane? But creative-wise, spending A LOT OF TIME creatively thinking and creating? He would rather do it on tiktok instead for sure! So yeah! cheers to his new life! I only hope he finds peace and quiet, continue growing maturely and do well :D
Jeffree has changed a lot! He does look happier but I can see there's still something missing. I'm really vibin w his new attitude. There's definitely something off though. Idk man if he doesn't bring you peace Shane, I'm not sure he's really your people. This screams business to me... Like there's some underlying motive. Something's not genuine. He's definitely got some work to do to earn his place back in my life. Honestly, Shane, I feel like you made Jeffree peak. Not the other way around. Don't underestimate the value you bring to the table is all I'm saying
Loved this video! It was SO good to see Jeffree and Shane back together. I didn't realize how much I missed their collabs. It was sad at the end, though. I never go on TikTok. I've been on it a couple of times, but I just don't get it. I don't really enjoy just watching a 24 sec to a 1 min quick video of someone that I would much rather see in longer vids where I can really enjoy their personality and get to know them (so to speak). I hope that Jeffree doesn't talk Shane and Ryland into leaving YT. That would be really sad. In the meantime, this was a great video and a great series, You do such a great job, Shane! (And Ryland, never leave YT because I don't know what I'd do without your vlogs and The Sip!)
I will forever love and cherish you and Jeffree for all you’ve done
I’m so happy to see you both back together. And I want Jeffree to know, you have some real ones that are always watching, me included. I’ll miss you more then anything! You make my days better! And Shane and Ryland do the same! At the end of the day, your happiness is most important, just know your true blue fan family supports you no matter what. Can’t wait to see the next episode. Love you all! 💋💋
ending made me cry. I feel like we will eventually lose Jeffrey, and I can’t help but think shane thought that as well. It’s scary and sad, emotional. That some day he will just move on and stop posting. I like how laid back these videos have been, but we need answers shane!!
Shane, I sincerely hope this doesn't mean you're going to follow suit and quit YouTube too. There are a lot of us out here that still watch you and would be very disappointed & saddened if you left. That doesn't mean you can't pursue other ventures, just means that we hope you still post here too. Much love from Canada to you, Ryland, Chris, Jeffree & all your many assorted critters. ❤
YouTube is my favourite platform I’m on YouTube literally all  day whenever I can, I’m finding it really hard to find new videos to watch now. And Jeffrey’s not wrong it really is dying. That breaks my heart because it’s been the most entertaining platform for me. I’ll be pretty sad if we lost YouTube which is how it’s looking. I absolutely am loving this series I need more!!!
jeffree looks more handsome now 😂😂 shitttt not me fall in love with his new looks n life
Jeffree looking like Alfalfa this whole video lol
I did get ripped off my jeffree star cosmetics. Js. Last year I bought blood money while in vegas. Someone stole it from me and jsc like didn't believe me. Like if I had the palette I would wear it. But they happily took my money. I wrote jeffree on Twitter too.
Honestly I’m sure people with hate it but I actually think it’s practical to use the sneakers… I means what’s the point of a gift or indulgence, if not to enjoy???
I know no one will read this but I feel that they should have blurred the faces of the other people in the airport in the beginning of the video if they didn't give them consent to be filmed. Otherwise I love watching these videos and I am so invested!
Tbh I love YouTube more than any streaming service but I understand JS’s opinions
I have no shame in admitting this, Jeffree and Shane, you guys are an inspiration. Watching you guys get out of the downward spiral and start thriving again and doing what you love doing is so peaceful and gives hope. Everyone has bad days, but it isn't the end after all. I am speechless and so happy you guys are doing this.
If you don't release that Palette and call it 'cancelled' you'll be a silly goose!
I totally disagree. YouTube is still my favorite app. The best part of my day is when my favorite people upload new content. It makes me feel close to people. The three minute videos are not for me.
I’m so sad
I’m not into makeup myself though I think it’s pretty cool. I’d rather see Jeffree making videos of just being himself having fun doing whatever he wants.
2 more videos and then you’re done!? Omg I’m sad! Jeffree you’re my life! What am I supposed to do with my life now 😢
Chris’ videography skills and Shane’s editing 😢❤
I was smiling this whole video🥺I can see how at peace Jeffree is and I also love seeing all of them back together❤️I definitely got emotional when jeffree said he’s hanging it up, but we just wanna see y’all happy!
It is hard to invest time into YouTube now - I really only check a handful of channels for new videos then get out.
I am still watching  please Shane and Rylan don't leave YouTube, the 3 of you were my go to watch. I don't like tictok. Don't you two go
It makes my heart so happy seeing you together again 🥺💗
Noooo!!! I love YouTube!!! I miss being doing makeup stuff on YouTube!!!
As a person who watches YouTube on the daily to see my favs, this hit me hard. Just because you aren’t getting millions of views doesn’t mean you don’t have loyal fans that care. We’re still here… that makes me sad..
SHANE! I’m SO Excited you’re back!  Being in Wyoming, dear, the Mountains do something that just make you Happy and down to Earth.  Something though, that I am not Grounded about…. I bought your first Palette and the “Put It Back!” Controversy Palette. I moved to Sheridan, WY on August 30 of this Year. I shipped all of my Items and my Make-Up Bin got lost. Yours was in there and I’m extremely sad that UPS lost it. I just bought Mascara and Eyebrow Gel.   Welcome to the Wyo! 😘
Ahhh SHANE. DO. NOT.QUIT.YOUTUBE.
Jeffree did a whole 360 on his lifestyle but its good hes happy with his new more quite life. Chill vibes only.
I missed Shane and Jeffree so much❤ they have been through so much yet they have come out of it  much stronger. I have been watching them for so many years and they are still my safe spot.
Must be more to the world than 1 minute videos. PLEASE! I do not want to watch 50 people do one line of the same song for an hour. I watch but maybe I have a nitch that works here. I like watching crafters of all kinds create. I love people using their minds to make things.
I hate cliff hangers, now I have to wait another week for more “reveal”!
As an elder millennial I don't have tik tok and definitely still watch YouTube daily! We're still here lol!
He will just be in another app and also living his life.  Kudos Jeffree! Do you boo! We will follow you ❤️
❤
ew why are you both back i forgot i was subscribed
I am over here still watching YouTube and looking for new content.  I’m too old for that TikTok life as I find it so superficial. I will miss Jeffree uploading and telling us his thoughts because he knows his shit and tells it like it is but I’m happy for him if he’s happy and chillin out of the limelight living out his yak farmer dreams. I’m still watching his uploads and following his content on ig ….. it will be sad to see him go and wasn’t expecting the video to end on such a sombre note. Sending love and continued good vibes.  Healing is a powerful thing and may everyone find their true peace and happiness.
Jeffree with no makeup, with eyebrows, living in Wyoming. Also he’s talking normal. He’s a totally different jeffree and I’m kinda digging it.
Ughhhh!!! I miss these gang!!! My heart is happy because you and Jeffree is living in a normal life 🥹❤️
Not jeffree making me feel lame for being high key addicted to YouTube 😂
really hope this doesnt encourage shane's thoughts to continue to distance from youtube.. but jeffree is really onto something. Shane and Ryland are the only ones I still come to youtube for...
I loveeee the star yak ranch. Living in the open country like that is just so iconic
🥺 it's very shocking
There are people that are still watching, but y’all are changing up your content.  Thank God Shane and Ryland still give us what we want.  🙏🏻
Could we get the next series on jenna marbles?🤔  That would break youtube!
*deletes tik tok immediately* 😪
BRING ON THE SPOOKY CONTENTTTT. 👻👻👻
I love YouTube 😭
Hoping Shane's video gets millions of views to prove JS wrong😭😭😭😭
shane’s face when the gun came out 😂
Jeffree and Shane are the only reason I still watch YouTube. I've literally grown up watching their videos, and honestly I don't blame them. They've been on the internet for over 20 years and if they don't find any joy in YouTube anymore then they need to peruse the things that make them happy. I love yalls videos, I love the inspiring stories, and I'll forever come back to these videos and remember how excited I was to see a new video from you guys but you deserve to be happy before you feel the need to make videos. I love you guys sm. Thank you for making my childhood, and I'll always click on yalls videos forever and always❣
when ur sweat stains create a Rorschach Test 🥰 #relatable #me #singlemomlife #slayingandpraying #wap🍷
Don't ever quit YouTube.  I love watching you shane I click on every video
JEFFREE GOT ME FUUUUUUCKED UP ALLA TIME. IM READY FOR IT ALL 😭😭😭💖💖💖💖
This video was sooo good. I loved seeing your reunion ❤️ I'll miss Jeffree on YT but can totally understand where he's coming from - he's done it all, and  more importantly, he's happy ❤️❤️
I was shocked to hear jeffree say he has two more videos and he's done.. im always double checking for new videos. I stopped watching YouTube as much when jeffree and Shane stopped posting as much
31 years old and got into watching Shane’s videos after hearing the “drama” about him but after watching him and jeffrees and now rylands vlogs! I literally am a huge fan of all of you. It’s crazy how your lives are literally in the sum of videos and the crazy shit you’ve gone through because of it. And the hate you’ve all gotten! I think you are all good ass people with human flaws I thank god my dirt is known by small amounts of people or I’m sure I would be canceled faster than all of you boys! Your all amazing in your own way thanks for letting us be apart of your lives Shane Jeffree and ryland❤❤❤
This title really changed from “The Retirement of Jeffree Star” to “The New World of Jeffree Star”…. Like wth those are completely two different things?!
NOOOOOOO Jeffree don't quit! my millennial heart can't deal with moving strictly to Tik Tok!
thats not true i will watch it always jeffree but go your path will allways love you !!!!
Jeffree ummm Im still there and millions of us ...I come home from work and check your channel if you uploaded. I check Shane , Ryland , Morgan and others that I follow for many many years. Im sad Jenna left...but we have to remember. Life is like a roller coaster...we go up and down...all we need to do is hold on tight and enjoy the ride.
I miss YouTube content being good. I’m sick of the trending list. It’s full of lames.
whats the background music in 31:20 during the car ride
I was happy at the beginning of this video but by the end i was really sad. I get were Jeffree is coming from youtube has changed so much alot is not for the good and alot of the reason is because of the viewer its all for the algorithm and people who have a problem how people film there videos with a lot is complains that this is safe for kids it needs more retraint more control and thats making it hard for the people who make videos because everything they do is looked through with a fine tooth comb. And with shorter viewing time with tik tok and all these other shorten times for what you want. Like with Disney plus, Netflix, hulu, and all the other platforms are making it easier to watch the things that you love without waiting. And me personally i love my short time waiting but i also love haveing to wait, its like that build up to watching your favorite TV show that comes only on Tuesday nights you would set that day and plan for it to watch it so you don't miss it. I miss that, there are some youtube that have kinda started doing that one being Shane he makes these fantastic series and he doesn't just put them all at once he spaces them out have people excited for them. Other youtubers i watch who have started do these things and thats what i feel like what is needed the wait the excitement more freedom to the youtubers to create something they love and are happy with throughs are the people who do great and continue to do great and what people come back too. I am so happy for Shane and him coming back to Youtube and continuing on youtube has been in my life for so long and alot of youtubers i grew up on watch are leaving. Youtube is my main form of entertainment. And I'd hate to see the people who i look forward to and watch leave this platform. Its a free platform to watch because not lot of people can afford to pay for these other platforms. And coming here to watch Shane and the other youtubers i watch takes me away to another place of less stress or sadness and its FREE! I love the long videos that youtubers do. I love that they make things that they want to share with us in there worlds. But things get abused and people miss up a good thing. But I do love and am happy that Shane is and continues to be happy and great so is Ryland and Jeffree.
Omg, wowwwwww. Why.. I still love watching YouTube soooooooo much…… I wish Jeffrey star will sa
All I want is shanes new pallet or a conspiracy restock
Youtube is not dead i come on here to look for a mix playlist while im taking a shower😩😩
I think everyone just gets the wrong idea about Jeffree. It’s shocking how much he has changed. But he does look healthier I can’t really say happier cuz I sensed he’s feeling lonely. I love you Shane tho for always being YOU! And I’ll never go anywhere I love anything you post as long as your in it. Just always loved your vibe and Ryland and your brother! ❤❤
I’m so happy to see all you guys back together! You tube hasn’t been the same ! Keep doing what your doing ! Smashing it ! Form England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
awww love u both this makes my soul happy
I love that Jeffree sees his faults, but he will always be a more business oriented influencer. Shane is that raw, authentic YouTube that fights for that original effect and influence YouTube had over so many people. He still holds onto that and believes it's not dead. It's wholesome that we see so many aspects of people just doing what makes them happy nowadays❤️
Noooo I don’t want TikTok to be the new thing it’s not the same
Well good thing podcast are in... can we get a Shane and Jeffree podcast?! That might be spreading everyone too thin having multiple podcast but I know so many people would be living for it.
I care about YouTube!!! I love you guys so much!
Is it weird I started to tear up at Jeffree leaving YouTube?  For better or worse, end of an era for sure...
In my opinion Youtube isn't dying. The fact is we all come to Youtube every day for DRAMA. If Jeffree is cleansing his life from drama, people aren't interested.  All his popular videos are ADDRESSING KANYE SITUATION, WE BROKE UP, KYLIE SKIN REVIEW, PINK VAULT TOUR. Now its Pallet Reveal, Makeup Review, New Brand, New Puppy. I guess it's just our nature to watch drama as it gives us the adrenaline rush we desire. So I don't believe the platform is dying, it's just you say it yourself, you're becoming boring to watch.
Love your CONTENT thats right nobody is clicking the like button anymore… but I try to😜👍❤️❤️
the only reason i come to youtube anymore is for this channel, maybe we collectively need to show jeffree more love also 🥺🖤
Americans pull out a weapon every 2 seconds. And when they go to mexico and see a gun they act like they have never seen a gun before. 🤣🤣
youtube is everything to me. I don’t even watch tv usually I choose youtube. when I wake up, on my lunch breaks, and when I come home lol literally addicted!
Noooo jeffreee!! Dint leave us 😭😭😭
Jefree, please don't say goodbye to YouTube- maybe just take a break?... I know I don't have TikTok...the closest thing to it is I'll occasionally watch YouTube shorts. You're right, it does feel we've watched  you do a ton of tutorials and 'is it Jefree Star approved' videos and I'd watch a ton more.....but watching you & Shane collab, go to Wal-Mart & switch lives for the day is the type of content I know I want to see from you. Let's see more of daily life on the farm or BTS running JSC at the same time. I've enjoyed watching you do podcasts as well! The numbers may not be what they were once, but that's not a reflection of the quality of viewers still here ❤ ☆ ❤ ☆ ❤☆  Ever since I had a stroke in 2020 at 31, I've not been able to buy any of these beautiful pallets or support in other ways like buying merch, so I watch every video, sit thru *most* of the ads, and try to post  comments/like to feed the almighty algorithm.
Wow this is so tender. Seeing Jeff was so special, the energy was sublime. Good to see them back- yet again !! Best wishes to u all ! Thanks for sharing.
Waited for.. this..
Im still watching 😢 💔
Im still watching 😢 💔
damn the ending… jeffree couldn’t be more wrong!! i’ve never downloaded tiktok, i’ve always stuck to youtube and I love my youtubers!! i’ve found even more within the last couple years! I love youtube so much and I will never get tiktok lol
Honestly, as long as us millennials are alive, YouTube will still be watched. We're creatures of comfort and I still watch almost every night
So he’s quitting YouTube? Mehhh he’s legit on tiktok which is the next platform compared to YouTube lol
Please tell the camera guy to stop shuffling over the mic please or whatever the heck he's doing lol
Growing up with Jeffree since I was a teen in 2003 and Shane for he last decade, I'm so fucking proud of their transitions into the even more beautiful humans they've become. 😭💜😭
I care about YouTube 😭
Let's normalize youtubers and tiktokers living normal fucking lives! Not everyone aspires to live in LA. That place sounds like hell.
Really enjoyed this.  Just chilled on the lounge smiling.  Can't wait for next one 💓
Born and raised in Wyoming, I love my state. Jeffree has made such a huge contribution to our economy, we love having him call it home. It's truly like no other place 💜💜
Shane and Jeffree doing a paranormal investigation would be sooooo cool!
I still watch jeffree videos almost everyday. I’ll miss him so much. He was my legit entire childhood, taught me how to do makeup, be myself. Love love jeffree ❤
please convince Jeffrey to not leave, some of us still watch youtube just for fun and we will support you and him.
"Literally NO ONE  watches YouTube anymore. It sucks" I guess we're nobodies 😭😂
I still watch you tube every day
Thankyou for coming back ❤ for us, your die hard fans this is everything
Depressing 😢
I still watching!😳😵‍💫😨
I’m not a Shane or Jeffree  “stan” but because of my age I do have history with J Star. So I’ve been there since he was trying to get his foot in the door for music I was in Highschool. I had no issues with him. As I got older I realized he had made mistakes but I never hated him. Shane I’m indifferent to. I’m not a subscriber and probably never will be but I’ve kept up with the drama like a normal curious person who was into drama that wasn’t theirs. It was escapism let’s be real. I say all that to say, watching this series has brought me back and it feels nostalgic in a dare I say *good* way. I’m impressed that Shane has managed to keep this series as just information. I’m taking it as it is. I appreciate the transparency and the humanity this brought back to YouTube/ the make up community/ influencer community. It literally feels like a new chapter but with a few sprinkles of the genuine joy the original series brought that was innocent and pure from diehard fans. I have no ill will towards either celebs and just want to say thank you for just putting it all out there without all the fluff and sparkles promos, any of that extra stuff. This is actually really refreshing and good to see. Thanks for the memories and just going with the flow. It’s appreciated. It actually feels appropriate to close 2022 like this. Best wishes to all involved. The growth is visible. Congratulations on hopefully finding the higher versions of yourself.
Cowboy Jeffree is suuuuuuuch a vibe!! I’m obsessed with this reunion, I can’t get enough of you all! So happy to see you all back together again (including Maddy!!!) ❤❤❤
Absolutely love this for him 😍😍😍
I can’t believe he is done. Wow that right there was big.
JEFFREE IM WATCHING I LOVE YOU
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
No, YouTube is alive very much! ✊🏼❤️
Everyone if you loved this series lets show our support and like everything: video's, community posts, instagram posts and stories.... Lets keep Jeffree and Shane feel welcome i really can't miss their content :(
I think that personally I will always come to Youtube
Starting to get the vibe this series is just round two to sell another palette and make these millionaires richer than they already are…
omg i'm so excited for this. missed you Shane!
I honestly only watch youtube, no tv/netflix etc. I really look forward so much to Jeffree and yours content together. I have rewatched your old 2 series about 15 times whole... Love it so much it helps me a lot
You can tell when Jeffree was talking about how YouTube is dead and no one watches it anymore, Shane got deep in his head right there. He didn’t say anything stayed quiet and contemplated if it’s time to move on from YouTube. 😥🥲
For better or worse it might be the end of an era
Ok.i LOVE youtube.  1 unlike paying for streaming its free. I find enjoyment out of it and so many of my favorites are just leaving. Also I have been so excited for these videos!
Also jeffree just released his new palette like last week. On YouTube. If he's gonna retire at least I guess that palette is bomb as fuck and I want it! And that mushroom mirror! Lol.
Not gonna lie when Jeffrey says no one watches me any more or no one see youtube broke my heart and I cry becuz I dont wanna say bye Jeffrey 😔😰 I always watch every video he makes I am not ready to say good bye...
When Shane and Jeffree together, it's just... magical. It's fun, sweet, witty, sassy, cool and epic. Even if Jeffree quits youtube, I hope he still does a lot of collaboration with Shane. I suppose they don't expect it, but their friendship is everything.
I’m still watching jeffree ❤ but I totally understand where your coming from
I feel so sad that amount the "no one watches anymore" I'm one of those numbers... And even if I couldn't contribute by buying anything cuz I'm broke as f.. 😭😂 I know God's gonna change that. But that hit different Jeffree, you have no idea how much you mean to even the 10people that still are the first to click on ur video over shanes🙄sorry not sorry Shane... I love that ur back.. But we gotta make jeffree stay these tik tok bs honestly just leads to people having shorter attention spans.. Commooon yack ranch channel life... The sweet life on the star yack ranch.. We can work on it but common Jeffree😭 my anxiety can't deal... Yall are the voice of calmness, the voice of percerverance, the voices of chaotic reason, like even if I don't agree with some things I can discern for myself but that's why yall are so good.. You know the "CONTREVERSY" ah.. Well I still watch.. And I'm sorry I'm not big enough for you to care about🙏🌼it's selfish I know... Me wanting u on YouTube just for me.. Like that's selfish but on God I'm greatful to be able to 5yrs from now say ur videos word for word.
I heard that "should I give her the canceled palette?" 😁😁😁 SHANE give me the canceled palette! Lmfao
Please release the palette
Even in countryside, jeffree never cease to amaze us
WE NEED THIS PALLETTE
Jef we miss u 😢
I think I feel the same as you Shane! I really didn't see that coming! I have every pallet he's made and I love watching his content! I don't know how to feel about it... I just want you ALL to be happy and healthy! If this is what he wants to do, I have to respect that! But I still watch!!! Jeffree, Ryland, Shane and Morgan! I look forward to ALL of you! ❤️
I Hope this vidéo will make 30m views so Jeffree dont quit… o literally have All thé streaming services à available and I end up watching YouTube… is this generational?
YouTube is still one of my favorite hobbies while doing the dishes or making dinner 😔
Guess I came late to the show, I watch u-tube everyday.  I'm sad JS is quitting.  I would love to watch his new life. I sure hope Shane and Rylan don't  quit. I look forward to every video they produce. I'm just kinda sad now.
Honestly it’s people that grew up with it I’ve been a Shane Dawson fan since the beginning and I mean “the beginning” YouTube is first on my favorites, I have my subscriptions and I can’t wait for that day of the week, TikTok has ruined it more expecting something soooooooo often the creator never has a chance to even breathe, that’s why they come and go so fast. 😅😢
I still watch YT and I love your art/masterpieces.. Please tho, add serial numbers to your videos’ titles; I binged watched previous series with JS and the order didn’t make sense 😂
This is so amazing to see how much both of you have grown. I love jeffrees energy now, hes so at peace with himself and his life. When he said he was happy. Like you can genuinely see it, and know hes so happy. My heart is so happy for you jeffree.
Love it. ❤ looking forward to part 3!!
💜
I'm not letting go of youtube. Jeffree DONT YOU DARE. LEAVE BEAUTY COMMUNITY ON YOUTUBE AND NOW YOU'RE IN THE YAK TUBE. 😀
When Jeffree made that comment about having “the stone” from marvel and Shane asked how that movie ends….it ends with massive, devastating destruction & loss but in a few years, everyone comes back! This is you Shane and Jeffree! Loss and destruction but in the end, you guys COME BACK! I understand Jeffree’s decision to quit YouTube but I will literally have 1 less reason to live if you quit too Shane! PLEASE MAKE CONTENT FOREVER!   Love you all so much! 💕
Imagine getting 1million views per video and saying youtube is dead O.o You know how many people are happy they got 10k views... lol I mean I am glad he is quitting for himself, but to say youtube is dead, is just wrong.
I literally love you guys together
Idk how I feel about jeffree saying YouTube is dying when I olny watch YouTube and twitch daily so him saying it’s dying does it mean I’m the odd one out because I still watch it hmm 🤔
This makes me sad, because I still watch youtube videos while I shower and get ready for work every day. I’m a travel ultrasound tech so I leave my family for a few months at a time. Watching YouTube content honestly helps kill some of the loneliness because it still feels like you can connect with the content creator. I can’t get that with tiktok because they’re short videos. I also don’t always want to watch a full on show/series on streaming platforms either. Seeing people tell stories or review things still makes me feel connected to people. I will say I do agree with “Beauty Youtube” changing and fading out. It got super toxic right before the pandemic hit, and I think the pandemic really did change everything…. No one wants that fakeness anymore because the pandemic showed us we need to focus more on what matters and makes us happy. I still find joy in many YouTube creators and I have found myself smiling so much watching you and Jeffree together again. You both seem like renewed people and Jeffree’s whole energy has changed. I love that you both are in such better places now and I wish you the best on your future endeavors. 💜
I really love all of you. You’re wonderful and to me? YouTube isn’t dead. Unless you’re unhappy doing it, please keep making videos because I will always watch. You two have genuine great chemistry together and a great friendship and that’s rare so. I really hope you allow us to keep viewing this amazing content from the behind the scenes of what it takes to create things to just joking around together. Most importantly is you guys individual happiness. Do what you love. Life is short enough. Thank you for continuing to share with the world, and for the content that brings so many of us joy.  You’re really great. To me. You were never canceled so. You should have released the palette. Us fans will ALWAYS support. Always watch the content, always root for you. Btw. So don’t forget. Never forget you’re not alone, through all the hate even. We care. 🖤❤️ always have, always will. Much love. Please don’t quit YouTube.
Anyone remember when Jeffree hinted at a foundation? I think it’s been years but I haven’t forgotten… still waiting and hoping for that launch
Nothing is more sad to me then to hear Jeffree say YouTube sux because i love my daily fix of YouTube on my TV not phone or computer. So to hear TicToc and Instagram are the thing just saddens me no end. I love my docuseries and all the daily clips pls Shane don't ever be the same stay your lane and keep me entertained hear on YouTube.
You should do a astrology pallet
I mean i still watch youtube but its kinda true. More people tends to go to other platforms like netflix tiktok and all.
Jeffrey has a point youtube is basically only for music videos  or at least that’s what I use it for lol
Jeffree, I watch your videos, all your new release. How can you say no one watches it😢
I love this new Jeffree he looks way happier. Yeah it makes me kinda sad to see him leave YouTube, but it's the way of life and yeah all good things has an end. I am glad he took this decision with himself for himself. Yeah it's time for him to move on, start on new bases and breath again. Idk if he will come back one but I do hope that he will heal his traumas and get away (REALLY this time) from all the toxicity he has been surrounding himself with. Anyway love you guys, hope you will continue to grow into better versions of yourself.
I don’t want Jeffery to leave he saved my life
Not sure that "YouTube is dead, no one watches, you all suck" is the mic drop moment you wanted to abruptly end this on while we wait a week for the next ep. That's an insult and middle finger to all your viewers that came here to watch your video
jeffree: "no one's clicking anymore." Also jeffree: *has 1mil+ views per video on recent uploads*
PLEASE DONT QUIT YOUTUBE 🥺
I literally spend soooooo many hours watching my favorites on YouTube more than I spend on any other platform. Hearing Jeffree say no one cares and no one watches hit me in the feels
I don't know how many times I have re watched the Jeffrey and Shane videos they just never get old, I still cry happy proud tears every time and I get so excited for anything new. I would legit watch Shane do anything the editing is so good it makes it such a joy to watch, please don't ever stop making videos fuck them hoes :) <3 sooo much love for you all
I honestly hate tiktok because it took from us the comfort and joy we used to have when we came to YouTube to watch our favorite creators just live their life. Tiktok does not give me the same excitement and joy that YouTube did, its just something I mindlessly scroll through when I need to pass the time. I miss the days when we could just sit down with our favorite creator for a little while and escape. It feels like they've turned their backs on their subscribers and abandoned us for the easy views on tiktok. It really is heartbreaking especially when you've made these people a part of your every day life for so long. It's like losing a friend
I love jeffree being so comfortable and happy. Shane & ryland as well. This is all so genuine. It saddens me greatly to hear of jeffree wanting to quit youtube… but i get what hes saying… but jeffree if you ever see this comment… know that you have fans that will always watch you. Know that
Jeffree has a bit if a southern accent now😂😂😂
It was only a matter of time. I knew this day was coming quick. Every good thing real does have a short lifespan. But I’m glad Jeffree got out of all this mess before it ruined him. While some creators are still hanging on by a thread and some false hope. But sooner or later they’ll have to move on. Fans will grow up and change interests. Trends will always quickly come and go. And there will be nothing left for these celebrity gossip vultures to ruin. But in the end there’s one thing I know for sure… Jeffree and Shane will go down as legends, heros, conquerors, victors, masters, survivors, and angels. I hope that by the end they understand just how much they helped so many people around the world. How many lives they’ve touched. Despite all that they’ve been through they came out stronger than ever and that speaks a lot. Especially toward their fans. I’m so proud of them and only wish them the greatest in everything they do from here on. May they succeed and prosper in life and all they do. I know this isn’t the end for them but I just want to take the time to say “THANK YOU!!” With all my heart and all my love “thank you!” Thank Jeffree!! Thank you Shane!! 🥹❤️🥰
☝🏻😪 TBH… I think everyone needs to do what’s best for them.. also I use YouTube the same as I did when I was 9 in 2008 as I do now at 22 in 2022…. I never watch tv 📺 and I use YouTube 18 out of 24 hours of my day.. soooooo for STARRRR to say that nobody watches his vids anymore that feels insane to me 😢because what?!? But like I said everyone do what you gotta do.. no pressure ❤
My YouTubers can not leave me :(
Feels like im waiting for game of thrones episode every week, i lovee shane and jeffree ❤❤
I only watch YouTube for you, Ryland, Lizzie & Morgan anymore (Bailey Sarian but she’s not part of ya fam as far as I know, sorry😂) ! Keep doing what you do 🥰 I have loved watching you all grow as I grow up! I watched you when I was probably way too young & now I’m almost 24, planning my wedding & watching your videos to wind down after a long night working in healthcare! Thank you for being you❤️‍🔥
You all together is YouTube Gold 🥺💛✨✨✨✨✨✨
I have to say im 36 and my kids and i still watch YouTube and Jeffrey i still watch you and love you so much ♥️
I will always click on y’all’s videos and this one is epic asf
Why did I cry when Jeffree said he was quitting YouTube? It really made me sad. I have loved both of your videos for years. Ill admit I haven't been watching his videos like I used to and he hasn't been posting like he used to. Honestly, im happy to see his growth and if it means him being at peace with himself and happier, then that is great!
Jeffrey looks do happy. Love this
Jeffree if your reading this your die hard fans will miss miss you
“YouTube sucks‼️‼️ No one ever clicks anymore!”   The 19.5M of us 👁️👄👁️
I love youtube I make tiktoks but don't watch them I mean tiktoks are boring. Short videos of literall nothingness.
Shane and jeffree is the funniest thing i have ever seen I mean their sense of humor is hilarious 😂 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
shane twisting the top off of a flip top smartwater bottle is jail
i’m gonna be so sad if jeffree actually leaves youtube. like my two favorites are shane and jeffree and idk how i would feel if one of them left. JEFFREE I WATCH ALL OF YOUR VIDEOS!!! YOUTUBE IS NOT DEAD
Move in to other things that should be smiling and laughing...thats a.fucking goal bro...glad to see him happy.
SHANE!!!!!….I understand what Jeffree is saying and even how Ryland has mentioned how it’s rough to be a YouTuber because the views just aren’t there anymore but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE DON’T EVER QUIT YOUTUBE…..I literally am still the few who come home after a very stressful day and find peace and happiness in your videos & Rylands and Morgan’s videos 😢  I would be so devastated. I’d feel like I lost a life long friend.
It was nice seeing Jeffree again, makes me wish I knew you guys in person. Thanks for another great video, Shane, looking forward to the next!
I watch YouTube more than anything 🥺🥺
Um. I see Jeffree brushing out those yaks and the fiber that is flying away sorta makes me want to cry a little. Yak wool would be amazing to spin into yarn! Also, is Jeffree utilizing the fiber part of his herd?
Changed the title from the retirement to the new world of Jeffrey star?
if jeffree just went to like weekly vlogging i’d love it tbh i mean i get him wanting to stop completely because it’s toxic and shit but i couldn’t imagine not seeing his content anymore.
Nooo, i literally re watch all your old videos . I love jefree . But I would love to see more vlogs
Jeffrey I still love watching you Shane, Ryland, Morgan and Lizzie I will be really sad if you end up leaving YouTube because then what else is there to watch I can’t relate or feel close to any younger generation YouTube creators because I’m not in there age range :(
i reallyyy hope u guys go ghost hunting in the next eps!! i feel like it’d be hilarious with jeffrey😂
Youtube is not dead is just depends on the content you make. Makes me sad jeffree is done with yw. I guess gen z took over and maybe even the generation after that.  I don't have tiktok or snap so I guess I'm officially old as a 31 year old. 😶
I still open Youtube daily to watch content, and look forward to planned releases from my favs. It's just that the people who put on a video out of boredom moved to TikTok to do the same there, but those who truly enjoy the content stayed here - like the countless people who have already commented here. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit sad from this news, but I completely agree - if it's not making you happy, move away from it. Maybe Jeffree will be back on Youtube one day, maybe not. But it makes no sense to keep doing something that doesn't make you happy when you don't need to do it. ♥sending love ❤
YouTube isn’t dying, many people watch it daily,, it’s my main streaming service because it’s free lol
I’m living for this series ❤ Also a ghost haunting video with Jeffree would be everything
You guys need to still do YouTube tho 😢
idk why this 55 minutes felt like 15 😭😭
Peep at 23:50 of downtown Athens Ga on College Av. Of Ben & Jerry’s, The Clubhouse (clothing store), The Grill(famous to Athenians but SADLY closed down a month ago), and Henry’s Clothing Store!!! ❤️🤍🖤❤️ #godawgs
I absolutely love wyoming! yellowstone national park is incredible 🥹 10/10 would live there
Me literally on youtube everyday for hours on end and use it even to watch things with my kiddies but ok LMFAOO
God im so fucking proud and so happy for you guys. You've grown so much. I just love you two together ♥️  Sending you so much love, support and prayers from my family and I here in Wollongong NSW Australia ♥️💙
Jeffree & Shane had YouTube ON THE MAP! ... And Im here to watch it happen AGAIN.  Youre born for this Filming and Editing Shane, we're here FOR IT !! ❣️❣️
I was so happy when Shane started making youtube videos again. I will be so sad if him and Ryland stop youtibe. Tiktok is not the same! You cant get invested into videos on tiktok.
Omg this makes me so sad!! YouTube is always my first option when I turn the TV on! It makes me so sad so see how Low views have gotten, TikTok really out here ruining the good stuff!! I am loving this series and it’s made me realise how much I miss Jeffree, I don’t care for make up videos now but if he did other content I would watch every day!! Shane promise you’ll never leave us! 😢
So amazing to see everybody's growth & how everyone is truly flourishing & where they want to be / on the right path to healing. Also I understand Jeffrey's decision to leave YouTube, as it wasn't a very big surprise - but I do want to comment that for me personally I can't afford streaming services, and I refuse to go on tiktok so YouTube has remained the number one platform for me. I know I can't be the only one. Other social media platforms may be dying due to TikTok but YouTube can be revamped, it's still remains a top tier platform through and through, and keeps a place that isn't just for instant gratification like literally every other platform now. So please don't stop now lol 💜💜 luv you forever no matter what
OMG I'm only 20 minutes in to this video and I'm obsessed loving it 😍
I am in tears! Times has gone by so fast and feels full circle. After losing my dad this past summer. This has really been a wonderful distraction/outlet the past two weeks. Thank you guys! Love you, Jeffree and the crew so much!
time to jenna marbles and do something else, at the very end really hit me… i miss the good ole times but its true we are all grown and we should let go of things that dont spark joy
I guess for Jeffree it makes sense that he feels like Youtube sucks and is over because he really has been on here for soooo long. He already did everything he could think of and maybe now he's just done with creating for Youtube. Doesn't mean Youtube is dead lol Actually Youtube is getting more and more viewers everyday! But for someone like Jeffree it may be repeitive or overdone. If he feels like Tiktok is more for him that's great! Do what makes you happy :)
Shane did you hear yourself say “The Cancelled Palette”!? Easter egg or you should TM that shit asap
I get that JS is over YouTube, but as a viewer, I still watch it. But, I am pretty selective about what I watch and probably consume way less than average. But I look forward to Shane, Ryland, Morgan, Jeffree, and a couple others. I will always miss Jenna.  But some of the YouTubers that were big and were always on my feed, I don’t even say their names out loud, because I don’t want my phone to start showing me their stuff.
No no no. Please don't let Jeffree quit youtube. I hate the idea of having to go to tiktok to watch him. I LOVE Jeffree. I look forward to every single one of his uploads, he's one of my idols and inspirations. I'm in a damaging horrible home life right now at 18 and he's my inspiration that I can change. That I can get tf out, that I can have it all and be happy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have this kind of hope for myself. Seeing his videos every few months grounds me even though I wish he'd upload more. We do watch. And we do care. I'd be so depressed if he quit youtube.
Jeffery got a silencer o.o
What is the name of the song playing at the very end?
Hearing he’s quitting YouTube is actully very sad it’s an end of an era😭 but I’m actually so happy for him he seems so happy and accomplished love that for him. But why did he get canceled this last time? I heard nothing about that
The people i watch regularly are getting views, but i don’t think there are as many females watching as there were before tik tok 🙃
I really enjoy this Jeffrey - he seems genuinely happy ❤
How much did Hummer pay you for this video???????
Why am I crying a lot watching this 😭😭😭 God I love Shane sooooo much 🥺🖤
I want 🔫  videos from Jeffree Star randomly 😩 😫 😭 i pay for all you sub services and still end up on youtube also triple platform your tiktoks to shorts and reels there are ways to make videos still its just different then it used to be JEFFREE START REACTION CHANNEL 😉  I would 💀 is it jeffree approved and you could make a 10 min reaction video for youtube then break that down to 3-5 tiktok/short/reels if i wasnt one of those ppl who work 24/7 to keep the lights on and my babies happy i would do the things bought the camera and all but just never made the jump
the paranormal series would be SO GOOD PLEASE DO IT!!! 😭😭😭😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
the paranormal series would be SO GOOD PLEASE DO IT!!! 😭😭😭😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I watch or listen to YouTube in the background almost24\7. But if this makes him happier I support him!
Seeing Shane in the last row of a commercial flight was such a stark contrast to the shots of him on the private plane. What a difference a few years can make. But Jeffree sums it up perfectly... "we've gone green now!"
No Jeffree, we’re still here........
When he said no one watched it no more, but this is me everyday 👁👄👁 😂😂 DON’T GO JEFFERY!! 🥺💗
“I saw Shane in person and he’s fatter in person” 💀💀💀💀💀
great vid shane!! ur content has always given me so much serotonin, looking forward to the next😎
I know it's cool to hate on you guys, but as someone who grew up with you Shane I am SO happy you're back
makes me wanna cry a little but i guess i get it. if youtube no longer feels like a good place to be then maybe good to call it quits TAT
The nostalgia of this series has made me so incredibly happy! Hearing Jeffree is leaving honestly breaks my heart, i still watch YouTube for enjoyment so for him to think it’s dead is so sad. 😕
I am sure some things can be topped on youtube Jeffree. I think you have just found upir new space in life! Glad you did! However youtube is not dead for everyone
Jeffree is being really freaking smart. Moving out of California if you, can do it! Everything’s overpriced probably has to do with how overpopulated it is now that only certain people can afford that luxurious lifestyle while middle class can barely afford groceries now.
I love how genuine they’re friendship is. No drama between them and they can relate with each other in so many levels.
You should make a conspiracy of the Denver airport or the tunnels under Vegas
Jeffree gets over a million views on every video what does he mean no one is watching
Jeffree saying he’s leaving YouTube it brought tears to my eyes 😢
Shane and Jeffree are going to single handedly bring back the YouTube clicks with this series! PERIOOOODDDD 👏👏👏👏
jeffery this is fucked up 😕
The dynamic duo rides again!
youtube is dying. it’s so liberal media now
Yall heard it here first  YOUTUBE SUCKS  DAMN RIGHT IT DOES
The Cancelled pallet is the perfect name for it tbh.. Cancelled
so he blue balled showing the pallet again….
I used to watch a lot of YouTube, now I'm down to shane, ryland, jeffree and rich lux for entertainment. He's right in a way, but I'm sure some creators out there would love to have the views these guys get
OMG you know this will be a SERIES!! BITCHES! FYI this is getting OLD! I’m older than Jeffree and I am ready to RETIRE BC everyone is lazy af and those we WATCH are working so hard yet the viewers are wishing to be them…. Come on.   I’m a Gen Xer and I wish those were raised in my generation. It’s the best ever! Before social media and all the BS…
I’m so happy seeing this yet so sad knowing there’s only one more part and it’s done😭. Praying we get this gorgeous pallet! I’m so comforted by these series Shane does. So freaking nostalgic!☺️
I'm on YouTube for pure enjoyment.  I'm here to have fun, learn, and be engaged in its multiplicity content. Maybe he's right, and it's become like MySpace. But, there's still people out there who will meet you with the same energy. Maybe it's not the same numbers as before. But at the end of the day, would you really want that kind of self-serving energy around? As I get older, it's more important to find peace. And to me, success just  means being happy. I have far less "acquaintances" and even fewer genuine friends. And I'm good with that. My desire is to manifest quality relationships and leave a footprint of encouragement and light.  Regardless of the outcome, I'm here for this energy. And I can respect anyone who is on the path of becoming disconnected from the shallow emptiness of just EXISTING, but instead, they are more connected with actually LIVING and finding out what that truly means to themselves. 🩷🩷🩷
Me personally a 22 year old female who works full time, I’d much rather watch YouTube before starting any show or movie. I love catching up with the YouTubers I practically grew up with. On that note, I love that Jeffree is happier now more than ever. He truly deserves some peace after having to non stop grind for years trying to make it.
Hi shane many parts the audio wasnt clear and you didnt add captions please focus on that next time thank you and love the series
I dont want Jeffree to leave youtube😥😥😥😥 he was the first makeup guru i watched!!
I think places with mountains have more paranormal activity, lumestones a conductor
I still love and watch YouTube!!! I mean I grew up watching all my favorite YouTubers . I'm still here.
I really love the new  Jeffree
510k views and 44k likes in just 7 hours kinda proves YouTube ain’t dead
SHANE PLEASE NEVER STOP MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS I WILL LITERALLY DIE I WILL CRY FIRET THEN DIE THEN ROLL OVER AND CRY MORE
WHAT????? NOOOOOO 🥲
I'm so happy for Jeffree, genuinely. He looks so much more healthier, happier, peaceful, and excited about his new chapter. He has changed so much, literally getting rid of his million dollar home, most of the Birkins and a lot of the lavish style we knew him for. I like this new Jeffree because now I see him and think "Jeffree the farmer", "Jeffree who cares for his animals", etc. It's such a nice thing of Shane to do to show us this new chapter of Jeffree's life, I couldn't stop smiling. From someone who's seen his videos from WAY back in the day and saw who he was then to the person he is now, I'm so happy for him and only wish him the best💓
The end made me so sad 😢 through the whole video I was smiling and so happy cuz I missed this content soooo much !!! It always inspired me to live life . YouTube is my main source of entertainment but I guess cuz I’m 38 and this is what I’ve always lokked to ,, I love the long content , I hate tic tok ,, too much stimulation and so bad for us . Please Ryland , Shane , Morgan all the vets who are still making content don’t leave us faithful fans and followers .
They look like little cotton balls while barking at Shane. 😭
I have so many emotions about this
Wow
Not true about YouTube I watch lots of channels lol just not jeffree
dream team!!!
As someone who has rebinged the last series withbu and Jeffree 3x, i’m living for this series. I can watch 10 more episodes 😢
dream
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amen
I have lived in the middle of nowhere my hole life and could never do city life
14:06  Did Shane accidentally release the new palettes name ?! 😯
Idk...I'd hate to loose youtube...that's where everything  started...
I watch YouTube way more than I watch all of the streaming services I have or all of the other social media platforms, but I guess that’s just me! 🤷🏼‍♀️ Regardless, it makes my heart genuinely happy to see Jeffrey and Shane are still good friends and that they’ve both left the toxicity of L.A. behind them and are living their best lives and are genuinely happy. 💗
jeffree is so much funnier I can’t explain 😭
I just love Jeffrey and Shane together, I missed you guys so much! I cant wait for all the parts!
🥲I missed seeing both of your'll together its sickening. I too em afraid of loosing my greatest content creators on youtube if one click of mine could equate to a million i will click on your videos a million times Jeffree i really love your content. Shane awesome as ever and please you and Jeffree should create a ghost video or a few before Jeffree hangs his...well button i guess🙏🙏🙏
As soon as Jeffrey said “quitting YouTube” I got teary eyed.
Absolutely love the new jeffree and love how happy he is but I really don’t want him to leave YouTube. And so happy to see Shane and jeffree together again.
Ngl I’m gonna miss coming home watching your videos , this makes me really sad 💔
I get it. You were suffocated as everyone who shouts be yourself doesn’t really want you yo be yourself unless it fits into their narrative. So you went somewhere where you could be yourself bc hello there’s not many people even there to care!
Can I just please have the name of the song he uses in the beginning for the Buffy ad!!
I know Chris just wanted to pet the Pomeranians the whole time 😂
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Damn. Got rid of tt for my mental wellbeing, now YouTube is just slowly disappearing? Ugh. Pandemic fucked so much up
It's not that youtube is dead. People are still watching but you must be prepared that if you want to make commercial content on YouTube you can't do what you're doing. There are different generations of viewers here. So we, older viewers won't watch some contents that may be pleasing to 15-20 year old viewers. We aren't in their headspace and maybe we never were as we grew up in different generation.
if youtube is dead where is everyone gonna go??
oopsie poopsie!
This was sooo anti climatic... I mean JS rarely posts here on YT so it was kinda obvious.
Youtube will never die I look forward to every week to see shane and jeffery
ryland 😅
PLEASE DO A SPOOKY SERIES 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
jeffery looks like my friend luis tbh
"time to jenna marbles and do something else" that hit HARD
I.. love this new Jeffree… Maturity!
I can't even come close to expressing the sadness that I feel when Jeffree said he's quitting YouTube. I think he'd get more views if every video he releases is more than just an ad for his next release. I miss his tutorials and makeup reviews. I miss JEFFREE.
Jeffrey,  ryland and shane are my go to channels. I remember jeffrey back in the myspace days.
i didnt realise how much i missed jeffree and i almost forgot how entertaining it was to watch him. hes not wrong about youtube. quite literally i no longer sit and click on makeup videos here anymore. i click on shows like kitchen nightmares for more white noise than actually paying attention — i think majorly because reels, shorts, and tiktoks have shortened my attention span for slower educational type videos. Im so glad to see him being so truly happy. it seems like past years he was wrapped up and sucked into social media which could become so toxic for one to be in.. Im so glad hes out of that phase in his life now
I refuse to use tiktok… Am I the only one who still watches YouTube consistently? Am I getting old or something? 😅
I loved your past series with Jeffree. And I am so happy that you're doing it again 😍. Love watching your videos ❤💜❤
I still watch YouTube but not the beauty channels anymore, but I loved this video brings back so any emotions ❤️ plus being a Wyomingite I love seeing my state ❤
Honestly, after the cancellation i watch Shane and Jeffree series religiously. I just this duo and they literally make me happy just by watching them, i burst into tears seeing this episode because i was waiting for this for YEARS. I definitely will miss Jeffree on youtube, but whatever makes him happy i’ll be on board. I wish nothing but happiness for Shane and Jeffree❤
Absolutely adore this group of people. Shane and Jeffree have had a special place in my heart for YEARS. It brings me so much joy to see them happy and living their best lives. My heart broke when I heard Jeffree say that he's quitting Youtube. I feel like there's still so many of us who get on this app everyday to watch our favorite creators. I know I do. Between Shane, Ryland, and Morgan's content, to Jeffree's, some ASMR/gaming/misc creators, one of my faves Colleen Ballinger - I check this app everyday.   When Shane and Jeffree upload especially it's something I'm looking forward to and gets me through whatever I'm doing knowing I'll get to sit down and watch this later. I've absolutely loved Shane having another series, he brings me so much joy. The whole gang does with their passion and talent for creating. I just feel like we'll be missing out on a lot of Jeffree's life. I'll miss him here. I'm not much of a tik toker myself. Definitely more of a Youtube gal. Kinda don't even know what to say or how to feel. Feel very happy but sad that he's leaving but seeing the place/state he's in now makes it worth it. It's not like he's leaving the internet, just a big piece.   Just breaks my heart one day knowing there's a chance I'll come on this platform to none of them :/ Loving this series so far Shane and all. Please, for as long as it makes you happy, keep creating. It brings so many joy. Love you guys!
Noooo I love jeffree 💖  I watch every video
Jeffree is very wrong about YouTube. Why the fuck would I be watching this video if I didn’t want enjoyment? Maybe no one cares about HIS videos. YouTube is part of Shane’s work so it’s weird that Jeffree was shitting on it so hard. I watch YouTube almost every day because of the creators I enjoy watching.
So well done❤️I’m so proud of you😭and so happy you’ve came back to YouTube
500k in this many hours isn't nothing. It's not millions but it's isn't noone caring. P.s. I miss Jenna so much.
-I...
🤬🤬🤬
I'm not super hip with current music, anyone know the song at 43:38?
Loved this
I think I missed Jeffree....?
😭 Jeffree ❤️ I'm so proud of you and who you have now become! It's going to be sad for you to leave YouTube as so many still keep wanting to know what your up to and now how the ranch is. You do what is best for you but know that we still want updates and Shane! You keep intouch with Jeffree and do a video now and then, don't let that fabulous Star fade away  Or.... Shane & Jeffree Star Ghost Hunting & conspiracy in Wyoming series needs to happen. Holy Yak farm that would be amazing and the laughs would be so funny.
🥳   I ❤️ Shane and Jeffrey when they get together!! My heart just feels whole and I'm so happy to c u both together again and that you both have found happiness after everything u both have been through!!
Jeffree star needs to make vlogs I would love to see that .
Some hackers must be protecting Shane ...cam-girl free (pretty much) comment section btloi.
Jeffrey seems so happy it makes me fell whole seeing him finally being happy and not worried about the materials anymore. Also- He looks amazing physically he just has this glow about him.
The yay sounds after each pallet
please don't leave
shane plaece tell jeffree i always look at his videos and you
I missed those videos so so much! I hated seeing Shane being canceled, it was all nonsense, and I feel like world is healing now! Thanks for those uploads! ❤
Me if I stole a gun from my kidnapper: 22:48
I will respect whatever jeffree decides I will miss him on YouTube he makes me happy everytime I see his YouTube,tiktok and Snapchat’s and Instagram stories they make me happy and feel amazing about myself I will always love jeffree 💖🥺
It’s so refreshing that Shane is back and making amazing amazing videos ! I love Shane and ryland so much. These videos take all my stress away. I’ve been binge watching all of Shane’s old videos and so happy to see new ones! Never stop Shane 💕
Jeffery no... we.. I still love the content...ugh...Shane keep it up. Both of your energy is lovely to see. It brings me happiness.
At the end jeffrees 100% correct, if you didn't already make it big on YouTube back then starting now and getting as big as the top creators is impossible
The ending really made me super sad because I watch youtube daily on my phone and TV. It makes my whole day when my favs put out a new video. And it’s harder and harder because my favs are slowly leaving… I’m sad to see Jeffree go and I hope Shane and Ryland and Morgan won’t go anywhere for a long time…
i love the white jacket 🤍🖤
Rylan is so cute 😊
It feels like my childhood has come to an End with this news! I am scared Shane will do the same and then I really feel like my childhood has been ripped from underneath me. 😩😭
After they both moved from L.A they both seem so much more happier and that’s great
Where's the shade for the yaks
Okay but I really want shane to take a deep dive into the Denver International Airport conspiracy theories they are so crazy
I love you Ryland your hilarious
YouTube isn't dead, your content is Jeffree.
I still love YouTube and it will always be my safe space as far as social media goes. I think so many people still watch but it’s definitely not like it used to be. 🥺
Jeffrey is Lucifer
Idk why…but Jeffree seems so funny and real in this video…
I’m so happy to see you all together again. Iv always felt such a connection to all of you, as iv been following most of ya for, fuck, well over ten years.
I literally only watch you tube this really killed me but I am happy for him
jeffrey is such a main character - the moment he walked in to the airport, my simp ass was in awe - so was shane and ryland lol
It was actually enjoyable watching Jeffree in this! He just seemed real unlike any other time I’ve seen him. Can’t wait for 3!!!!!
I only watch YouTube..
I'm 34:24 minutes in and I'm only after notice jeffrees eyebrows. Only compliments from me.  Like slay 🌟
This makes me so sad, I love watching him on youtube, all of you really:( it makes me sad 😔
As much as I am happy for Jeffree it hurt me to see him leave YouTube. He helped me so much when I was dealing with being closeted from the public and he even helped me semi come out. It’s just wow, it hurts me but I’m also happy for him yk. Love you guys
So for someone who's quitting YouTube, he was just uploading two days ago and before that once a month that's not quitting that's just not uploading as often
wowwe your content is so amazing 🥲 it nice seeing how happy, raw, authentic and real with jeffree! you two have a true friendship! i love everything you upload Shane - it could just be you talking to the camera and i would click!   makes me sad Jeffree is going to quit youtube, you and him were one of the first people i subscribed too! but i get he’s growing and life is taking him in another direction it’s just weird…🥺 i feel like slowly the OGs are going away 😩 thank you Shane for doing this!!!
I love YouTube, seriously watched every single one of Jeffrees videos and Shane’s and rylands to this day I check YouTube and if they all stop YouTube idk what I’m gunna do 😢 please don’t stop Shane and ryland I’ll die ❤
I am loving this series so far, and just watching and hearing about things is just so interesting!! 😁 can’t wait for pt 3! I’m just so intrigued about it!
Cancel culture doesnt exist !
We dont forget the fact that you are cancelled
omg go dawgs
Hearing jeffree say he's quitting YT and Psychedelic Circus just dropped means there's 1 video left 🥲🥺 and that made me really sad. I watch his videos on repeat for comfort and Rylands vlogs got me thru some of the most depressing times in my life I truly hope he's happy we love you jeffree!!!!!💕💕💕💕
really happy to see that jeffree is healing and living his dreams in his 600 ACRE RANCH??! just seeing shane and jeffree brings back so many funny memories!! it’s been 4 yrs since the last series and when I tell you i was so sad when it finished:( shane and jeff is bond of friends that can never be broken! and if any any of y’all see this comment I just wanna say you are special no matter what! go and make your dreams come true! you may never know what’s abt to come! anyways congratulations jeff on you’re new makeup collection and congrats to shane for his new series on yt!! I literally can’t wait for more series !! and when jeff said “Wyoming is known for their spooky stories”it rlly brought back memories of when they used to take trips to haunted places:(( LOVE YALL
i loved this video so so much. so glad you guys are back x
Long form video isn't having a moment anymore for creators, and the influx of TT short form creators has replaced a lot of the OGs but there is a place for both.
This just seems like a really dragged out long unedited day in the life of someone. I don't know what happened to you. Shane, I mean your fan still seem to love it and that's all that matters. But yeah it's a bit s***
This whole I'm quitting YouTube is a crock of crap. Let's actually see if it's true or if they just really had no storyline for this docko so they made one up because really what? What are we talking about a pallet that's not coming out? How is this relevant? No it'll be relevant because you are going to bring it out and he is going to stay on YouTube promoting makeup. Yeah right? Like why didn't you make it about somebody else? This is kind of lame now. It's just like a really long f****** dragged out day in the life of
Yikes.. is this the end of YouTube??....😬
Still don’t have the first collab sadly but I’m definitely wanting this collab for sure
Jeffree got aMichelada mix 😋🤤💖
I LOVE YOU SHANE OMG 🥺 I been watching you since ASK SHANE ON MONDAYS ! you’re all I watch I love you so much 😊thank you for making my life better
I see what you did there.
long live  YouTube🖖
Ive never been so excited  to see something on YT like these kind of series especially with JS. Its because of him I started loving makeup.  I hope he really doesnt leave and abandon us 😢
I’m still on YouTube daily I love you guys you all have gotten me thru some really hard times
Jeffree looks good.
I missed the family 😢
I hope Jeffery doesn't stop making content for YouTube. People do watch and by saying you're only going to do it if the numbers are such and such. Is saying well the rest of your die hard fans that come regardless don't matter. I know myself well come i care less if he only got 20 views. YouTube not going anywhere it has a wealth of videos. People come to every day. And many people are still getting tons of high views. SO not sure where that's coming from. It's not quite like myspace quite yet i see it living for long time to come. It's good to change and he has no need to stop but in the end up to him but many we'll be upset.
I use YouTube way more than any of the tv/movie streaming apps. It’s been my go-to since high school ❤️
Literally everyone I know watches YouTube for entertainment. We are in the Midwest and those viewers aren’t leaving.
Shane you left us on a cliffhanger!!!  Can’t wait for the continuation video ❤️ I fucken! Loved it 👏🏻
I don’t even have tiktok lol I still just watch YouTube
Me thinking the big reveal would be JS addressing him slaughtering his “pets” (yes I know he has different yaks for slaughter 🙄) but nope of course no remorse for that.
This just makes me miss Nathan. Lol ☹️
I’m on YouTube every day for whatever it’s worth haha
People still care about YouTube. A lot of people still watch YouTube videos daily and watch some of their favorite creators. It’s not that people don’t use YouTube or care about it. People just don’t care to watch him anymore maybe????
I have the pallet it’s my fave and have used it so much I have bought it twice !!! Plus you and Jeffrey were never canceled to me !! Happy to see back better then ever !!
Yes queen
Jeffree is wrong about YouTube. Yeah maybe the younger crowd with there 30 second attention span are making Tik Tok famous but YouTube  is where we go to learn and now even Tik Tok had to increase from 30 sec to 3 min because the OG watchers can't stand the flash and move on of Tik Tok.
I feel that Shane was destined to go to Wyoming with Jeffrey, because Shane seeing Jeffrey be happy without social media, no publicity, not giving a fuck what people think etc. will make himself happy. If Shane leaves YouTube I would be sad but understandable. Maybe it’s time.
Wait why did you change it from the Retired Life of Jeffery Star to the New World of Jeffery Star??
OMG OMG ONG IM SO EXCITED EARLYYYYY
We do watch and we do care. I'm literally hanging on by a thread, literally and this series happened. I'm not being dramatic but its helping me, it saved me in a way, I'm not feeling down all the time. Thank you Shane.
I LOVE YOUTUBE I cried at the end of the video pls don’t stop!
People say YouTube is dead? Look at the amount of views on Shane’s videos 😮
The only reason why people aren’t watching Jeffree stars videos is because he’s not doing anything relevant or interesting don’t get me wrong. I love Jeffree star, but he’s getting lazy on YouTube, and it really shows in the views.
This is bittersweet… When Jeffree first started posting videos on YouTube, I was in a very dark place and his videos were a tool to disassociate from the real world. Now that he is leaving, I will be moving from California, and I have let go of a lot of materialistic things as well. I am in a better place mentally, and I am moving on, just like him. A full circle for me, if you will. 🤍
I'm so sad rn don't do this to me!!!
Me waiting for you to land in Casper seeing a perspective of my town from a fancy and new perspective 👁️👄👁️
Kinda hurt me to hear Jeffree say the Yourube is dead and sucks 😢 I’m still on everyday watching
Im happy for Jeffery but this made me so sad. Please don't quit Shane, you have no idea the happiness your videos bring to people.
I haven't been following these two since the conspiracy palette but I'm so happy that both of them are genuinely happy and content
I love you Shane and Jeffree very much and I always have watched and supported you guys since the beginning until now and thru the whole canceled bs. You guys have grown so much and are doing better and getting away from the toxic bs and living your lives to the fullest. Hope you guys continue your journey with peace and happiness.
❤❤❤❤❤
I still go to yt to watch all my favorite people including you and jeffree..
It’s so sad Jeffree has been so strict about making his products vegan and cruelty free, and now he’s farming Yaks for meat. It’s really put me off the cosmetics brand and I used to buy EVERY palette 😢
Love jeffree sm
Maybe no one watches beauty videos anymore but I personally am addicted to YouTube….
ahhhh love it 🥰🥰🥰
Honestly Jeffree is looking fucking sexy these days lol. The natural brows with the short cut dude he’s soooo handsome!! 😍😍😍
Shane your editing is so next level!
Just an fyi, I love your YouTube content!!!
Youtube is still my favorite app. Its so sad seeing everyone leaving 💔🥺
I still watch YouTube every single day. I always look to see if Jeffree posted new videos about upcoming products. I’ll understand if he quits, but I will still watch him no matter what
If we don’t get a pallet out of this I’m suing
Jeffree Star leaving youtube makes me sad :(
No one watches youtube for fun Me here for fun
YT is the only social media that I use... its sad that its dying
this makes me relise how fast time has flown byyy and still with u guys through it all
Wow you can really feel Jeffree's change in this video. A good change.  I'm still here for YouTube 💯
What happened to the old title? Retirement of Jefree Star ?
My family and I literally watch YouTube all day long.. and when my kids go to bed I’m on YouTube watching Shane, Jeffree, etc.. I miss their old videos messing around at Walmart and doing things like that 😂 I’m sad he’s quitting YouTube!
Jeff wrong on nobody watches YouTube all the YouTubers i watch still get just as much views as they always have It's just the beauty side of YouTube
Jeffrey seems a 1000x more happy than he was prior to COVID. He looks more healthy and relaxed and that makes me so happy. I’m glad he’s deciding to do what’s best for him, even if it means stepping away from YouTube. I wish nothing but the best for him ❤
I think if you switched it around and went the yake ranch homestead thing on youtube i would watch that over makeup theses days idk if anyones said this yet im sure someone  has
Going to miss you on here however dont think il be on this platform much longer either.. Much love xx
So much to unpack here! I have always admired Jeffrey’s intelligence and work ethic; it is good to see him in a better place and look so healthy. Also, I still watch You Tube, especially Shane, Ryland (and Lizze) so please don’t stop!
Jeffree talking about how no one cares about him on YouTube breaks my heart 😢
Doubt he’s going to quit, every time he’s promoting a new palette, he’ll Be here.
I feel like I definitely would watch more YouTube content if there were less ads and youtube didn’t pressure/push “YouTube red” so much. That was a huge turn off for me when they started all the commercialization of it all. Regardless I’m so happy to see this reunion ❤
jefrees new look here with grown out brows is giving justin bieber! u look hot mama!
Loving the new series! I know I’m seconding so many other comments but it’s just so crazy to me to hear that “YouTube is dead”… I literally go to YT for my content 99% of the time, the only reason I would ever turn to Netflix etc is when there’s no new content from my subs. I just don’t agree w Jeffree 🧐
Wait I’m so sad now jeffree is gonna leave :( I’m sad
I still use my palette often!
sooo are they making the pallet?!
omg that is crazy,its hard to see such a big influence leave and hearing that "youtube is dead and no one watches it" is wild because im here almost 24/7
So at we getting a new pallet or what??
The natural chemistry Jeffree and Shane have have as friends is the best thing to watch. There's never a dull moment and it makes you wish you were there to experience it all in person. Thank you Shane for making another series we definitely needed it. I'm so excited to watch what's coming next.
Jeffre is an icon ❤ i love you guys. You guys are part of our history 😍 Im so glad to share lifetime in the same time as you.
nah why am i crying at him stopping youtube, end of an era fr 😭😭
😂😂😂 We are on YouTube to watch you and Shane 😢 we do still come to YouTube, at least make an appearance of who you are now, kind of like a journal to encourage someone else, life comes in seasons!! Proud of you Jeffery! 💖💖💖
Jeffree looks so good
Cancel culture is incredibly ridiculous! We all fuck up! We are fucking human! The difference is that the majority of us don’t do it in front of millions of people. All we can do is grow, learn, and do the best we can! There are a few content creators that I have grown up watching that have brought so much joy and they all make mistakes! It’s so awesome when some of them decide to push through the bullshit and continue to share their lives with us and help us in ways that they don’t even realize. I may sound naïve because they make money with what is shared but we also benefit from the content they create. This was such a special video and I appreciate that it was released. I can only imagine how hard it must have been to release to the masses. It was risky, but thank you for trying! These people are human! They have to endure in the public eye. That changes the game and most of us can’t even imagine how hard this must be! Thank you again for sharing this content! Inspiration all over the place! I care about YouTube and always will.  I guess we all can see what has happened to the YouTube space. It is devastating to so many of us and can only hope there is a major shift and our favorite content creators can find love an passion again and continue to share it with us! It means the world to so many of us. Youtube is still my escape fuck everything else!
It makes me really sad to hear that he may leave YouTube! I still watch all my faves on Youtube! I could never imagine him leaving, makes me want to cry!
Can confirm, the ghost history is crazy in Wyoming
I watch YouTube every day, that’s all I do thanks Jeffree 😒
The thing is that Jeffrey does not have YouTube audience anymore, he said it himself, he has done everything and I used to watch him because he was so eccentric but for the past 2-3 years he really became irrelevant and boring. While I still watch bunch of other youtubers like Shane, Ryland, Morgan and so many other ghost hunting, crime channels that are very interesting. Yes, YouTube is not in its prime, I feel like the prime was between 2010-2020 but it is a multi-million dollar company its not going to disappear just like that.
I watch YouTube for fun 😭
yay trigger discipline right away!
Ugh my 2019 heart 🥹❤️
Does anyone know the name of the song Shane used in his intro??!!! It sounds like a vibeeeee
"as long as you don't use they/them you'll be fine" - deceased!!
I still watch YouTube like everyday 😭 maybe it’s bc I don’t have TikTok.. I hate it, it’s too addictive and brainwashing for me 😅 real people like you guys are on here, I watch every single rylan vlog, because it’s just about life and real shit, love you guys 🥹🙏 btw Jeffree your literally such a big inspiration 😭😭 😢
Lol the speeding car hahahahaa full circle Star creek road!!!!
Im confused, just went to Jeffrey's channel and hes still pulling great views, so what?
Did the title change? *I could’ve sworn it said “The retirement of Jeffree Star” a few hours ago.* 😂
I still love these series i don't care about the whole "cancelled culture" thing and i actually enjoy Shane's videos and jeffrees always have tbf.
to not have the news app bc you're afraid of what might pop up about you vs. all the things that are going on in the rest of the world is.......a lot.
its not on my home page i think the video is shadow banned
Happy to have y’all back, yearned for this lol
Omg... now I'm sad.....
Wow.....that's all I can say!
Jeffree gets more views on YouTube, he gets almost nothing on TikTok
If Morgan Shane and Ryland stopped posting I wouldn’t be on YouTube anymore 💀 I already lost all my other fav YouTubers ☠️
Never saw that coming. No more Jeffree on YouTube. I’ll miss him on here but I’m happy he found his peace. Can’t wait til the next part. Awesome series Shane.
Jeffree, I watch 🥺 I definitely care but  I understand things are moving to TikTok…but I can’t do it!! I’m so gutted to hear you’re done with YouTube. I love how you left California and moved to a better environment, I wish I could do that right now. You’re living a quiet and simple life which I’m super jealous of. I’ll be sad to see you leave YouTube but do what makes you happy ❤ never stop making makeup and being yourself 🥰🥰🥰
this videos are confusing.
To hear Jeffree quitting YouTube was like a stab to the heart. I still go on you tube all the time. I always watch you guys. Yes I have tiktok but I don't ever use it. Idk maybe it's me, because I'm older and I'm not the type of person now to go on tiktock really. What about  snap chat, like I loved snapchat but I still always come back to YouTube. Well its Jeffrees decision he knows what he wants and I'll respect that . But Shane please 🙏 don't leave us too. This is what your Amazing at and I mean that from the bottom of My ❤️. Chris, Ryland and Shane you guys together I just look forward too so much. My life is literally ha crap and i always look to you guys and Jeffree for just inspiration to do better in my life.  I'm not just saying that. Can't wait for the next chapter. Love you guys.  Xoxo 😘
Shane you HAVE to do a conspiracy video about the Denver airport
I had the drunkest weekend of my life in Casper wy
29:10 omg SHANE AND JEFFREE HAUNTING SERIES
I still love youtube.
My heart sank when Jeffree said he was quitting youtube.. I still watch him DAILY I rewatch all the series everything. You two were such an iconic amazing entertaining and most of all REAL friends to watch. I will always miss this <3
I didn't saw that coming! 😭 Jeffrey quiting no....
The part jeffree said we went to Walmart and got 30 million views like damn I’m bawling my eyes out from the news even tho I haven’t really watched in years so yeah he’s right no one is clicking anymore but tbh you know what all the cancel couture is what did it. It really sucks it had to end that way because watching everyone post back in the day really made me so happy all the trends were amazing and honestly legendary and iconic ❤️❤️❤️
I watched the new Jenny Nicholson video about an obscure niche theme park. A video about how the concept of it was beautiful and grand and in reality is very sad and abuses its employees. I watched that 4! 4 hours long video. 3 times. 3 times because I was so fascinated. Totally engrossed the whole way through.   I could not watch the first 5 minutes of this. Skipped over. I didn't understand the strange ad? I assume? That took the first like 5 minutes, and then the next 15 minutes I skipped through every time Shane thinks he's fucking edging me with good content. It's not. Show me. Literally it's a basic device of good story telling. SHOW ME don't TELL me. Don't talk about this crazy thing that might happen for 15 minutes. You know who cares? You your mom and the asshole doing it with you. Not fucking me.  Really engaging hour long video for sure.. Literally throw out half your build up, bullshit footage. Make 3 parts just 1 long ass vid. And it probably won't be that entertaining. But at least your not wasting my time promising a more exciting part 2 and 3.   All that I wrote above was before I'd finished watching. I wrote it. Reread it and told myself it was a little unfair to critique an entire video in 20, boring, minutes. I skipped alot with no consequence to the understanding of the underlying idea and end point of the video. But still I should probably watch the entire thing before I judge. And then I did that. I only skipped over a couple of bits that were gratuitous and took too long to get to the point. (What was the car thing? You have a cool car that goes fast. Vroom vroom. And also get fucked) I watched the whole thing in under 30 minutes probably. And in the end. I have a worse opinion of everyone. Shane is shit at making content. How about after being weird and creepy and being cancelled for it you don't make what's essentially a super long vlog about your more famous friend. Including all the bits of you awkwardly laughing. And doing the same filler bullshit as in the first series.  And for Jeff. I was almost swayed. And then he says the dumbest out of touch bull shit to come out of a social media persons mouth.  Like I Said when I started this I had just watched a 4-hour long video by a creator I adore, three times over. I loved every second of it, it was amazing. I'm looking forward to her next video when it comes down the pipeline in 3 to 4 months. Or maybe 9 months who knows. The video currently has 1.4 million views. It's not 33 million views of going to fucking Walmart doing fuck all but obviously it's engaging enough about a nonsense topic that nobody would know anything about to pull in that many people so I would say in my opinion. You're a dick head, and just doing it fucking wrong. However if all that matters is 30m views per video. Then babe. Your still not getting the fucking point. So in conclusion FUCK BOTH THESE CUNTS. I SPENT MORE TIME ANGRILY CORRECTING THE GRAMMAR ON THIS COMMENT THAN I DID WATCHING THIS GODDAMN VIDEO.
Jeffree saying no one watches YouTube  Me watching all of Shane Dawson videos 😳
I’ve been watching YouTube for about 13 years now. Shane was the first person I ever watched. 13 years of funny, sad, happy creative videos. Jeffree saying YouTube is pretty much dead makes me sad cause I know it’s true. Jeffree seems so much happier though not having to deal with all the bull crap of LA, hate comments and everything else. It’s nice to see Shane & Jeffree in a better place then they ended 2 years ago.
Lol ouch. Boy do I feel like a loser watching YouTube now 😅🤦‍♀️
IF THEY DON’T GO GHOST HUNTING AND MAKE A VIDEO MY LIFE WONT BE COMPLETE
I don’t see Shane as a makeup person. He’s doing it for money.
“we might open up a portal to hell” “I think we did that” LOL
Thank you for the videos Shane! I'm super sad the Jeffree is quitting youtube, but I'm glad he's got other things to do. When you really "rock" with someone you're happy if they're happy.
My jaw dropped.
53:47 I DO. I CARR
That's not true Jeffree. I love watching your videos. ❤️
What an awesome kiss goodbye for YouTube with y'all re-breaking the internet AGAIN on the way out.  👏 bravo,  well done. Btw love Jeffree guns 101 and Shane's face.  Love the 2A support ❤️
No but he’s not wrong, YouTube is not what it used to be at all. These vids are like the last of the good ones
I loved living in Wyoming (we were in Douglas which was about 49min east of Casper). Beautiful, peaceful, and full of kind people
YouTube doesn’t suck. Makeup reviews on YouTube suck. Jeffree is the master of pivoting, if he were to have a podcast on YT like Shane, I think he would kill it. He’s hilarious and has some wild stories. Getting the fuck out of California did wonders for you all.
53:56 I just found out Texas is keeping Abbot! I don’t need anymore bad news.😭 YouTube is my safe haven, I watch to get out of the world. We will miss you Jeffery.😔❤
Shaaaaaneeeee! You can't just end a video like this!!! I was literally on my toes!!! Can't wait for the next one!!!
I love seeing Jeffree pop up with approval videos! It’s going to be sad to see him leave. I honestly watch more YouTube than I do anything else.
SHANE WITH A GUN? I love this series so much already
The fact that Jeffery says that no one is clicking. Shows how that’s all he cares about, doesn’t care about the people or anything, glad that he’s quitting cause I never watched him anyways.
I love Shane and jeffree togetherrrrrr
Slay
Hahahaa this was hilarious  The gun and LA air lol
Please Shane do not stop making videos, you make a difference in a lot of peoples lives for the better, don’t have that mindset, that it’s all about view’s because it’s not!
Jeffree is right the people that I see thriving the most on YouTube are literally getting a consistent 5 million views a video per week. That's much less than what we've seen in the past (10+ million easy).
Youtube itself is dead, but I care deeply about the people on the platform. Shane's blockbuster movie formatting is very fitting for youtube and doesn't quite fit with other platforms. I've stayed this long because of people like Shane who are still building new things on here and connecting. I grew up with youtube, primarily daily vloggers, so other sites like Instagram and tiktok don't pull me in to care about and connect with the people on there. As always, very well done Shane. You always bring that special touch to each video and even more so with the videos in the last few years. If you do decide to leave, I still hope to see you in other realms. You create your work, not youtube. I think you need to go to places that fit with your style and allow you to show your work in the way you envision it. If youtube no longer does that for you, you have to go where it can. I promise we'll go too 💛
Don’t get me wrong I don’t watch YouTube much anymore but I enjoy watching Jeffree, I don’t want to go to TikTok to watch short clips 😒😒😒 I want the old days back.
I am so happy to see you back and hanging with JS
Ok just because Jeffree's views are decreasing doesn't mean YouTube is dying lol...
Jeffree’s wrong though. i, for one, am constantly watching youtube. i go to youtube before i go to any streaming service.
While Jeffery makes a point ,he is wrong about no one caring ! Yes,viewers may have dropped but there are some that do STILL watch YT & I am one of them( I also still post once a week,even tough my channel is very small because for me it has never been about money or fame ,it's for enjoyment). I am with him on the point of making a change, when you've done a thing for so long that it no longer brings you joy then it is time to change & to quote an old saying "All good things must come to an end",especially when there's no joy!
If a zombie apocalypse ever happens, jeffree place is the perfect place to bunker at. I could imagine the show “The last man standing” there.
Jefree is literally my idol❤
I love seeing Shane and Jeffree together again! It would be amazing to end this series with an official drop of the pallet, with it being called 'Cancelled", and if there's a mini pallet, to call it 'Meltdown'
I do feel for Jeffree I miss peak YouTube when everyone was thriving. It's definitely in its recession phase but one day it'll come back (hopefully soon)!
He's not wrong about YouTube, this is a dying social media.
Shane, you look so good in that suit vest.
SHANE LISTEN TO ME DONT YOU DARE QUIT YOUTUBE! I’ll fucking quit everything
Bittersweet but true. YT died down. Tiktok has taken over. I hardly get on it unless someone is speaking about it on a different social media. Nothing like the old YT community, the back to school videos, the what I got for Christmas, etc..
Well Jeffree people are watching YouTube as Shane has nearly half a million view.  People aren’t watching you Jeffree.
I CARE about YouTube jeffree
Wasnt Blood Money in 2020???
this is really sad 😢😢
I was raised in the YouTube era when it was everything and I will always continue to watch you 2 on youtube!!!
I don’t want y’all to stop making videos.
Wow. i can honestly say that jeffree has changed, i see his talk and his actions and wow I’m just seriously amazed at the growth.
I mean he’s not wrong…. If his business is making considerable profit elsewhere, why not right?     Best of luck to him!
I want more!!!
literally bout to cry because i love Shane and Jefree and I do still come to YouTube to feel happy. and tbh y'alls last series was my favorite and i feel like cancel culture ruined the good creators love to create.
The beauty videos I keep watching now are from smaller channels that do new makeup releases reviews. I don't care to watch someone do their regular routine, or in a crazy setup like an air balloon. I think Jeffree just isn't aware of what the YT viewers want now in 2022. I understand wanting to quit when he doesn't feel like it's worth it anymore. But here we are, watching another Shane long ass docu-series, and I'm quite enjoying it. It's nice to see Jeffree not always acting over the top as well. He's more "normal" in Shane's videos, rather than on his own channel. He just needs to adapt his YT content.
I ❤ this. TY! I needed to watch something amazing… and I found this new content. 🤩 Shane is the best when comes to conspiracies. Who would have guessed that Gucci was killing the ankle support game?
I can not believe you ended the video like thisssss Jeffreee noooooooo tht made me sad
The irony of all of us watching a YouTube video of Jeffree talking mad shit about how no one watches YouTube... #imdead
I don’t think I’ve ever clicked on a video so fast 😂
Im so sad I love YouTube
Yo we got a new Kardashian show that Hummer is so sexy magnificent choice
Remeber da old title jeffery retirez
I watch YouTube on a daily basis. It’s always my first option and if no one has posted I’ll either rewatch some of Shane’s or Rylands videos. Jeffree saying no one cares about YouTube isn’t true.
Tell me why I got emotional when Jeffree walked in the airport 😭
YouTube is definitely my first go too !! It’s sad because i feel like it’s nothing to watch because nobody’s making videos anymore but I’m here for them ❤️
😩😩😩 say it ain’t so Jeffree 😢😢😢 💔💔 but I agree with everything Ryan said at the end...
Honestly like I’m glad Jeffrey is actually happy now and YouTube does suck
I watch youtube everyday. lol But the channels I watch change over time, very few am I still watching that I was 8+ years ago.
I’m enjoying this series so bad omg I missed this feeling ❤
I hate that YouTube is dying…. It’s my get away from everything. I got laid off and super depressed and YouTube was there for me
This makes me so happy
Finally the content we needed again!! 😍😍🥰
The editing in this video is so on point
So......the ones who stuck by you are just loser fans on YouTube 🤔
I freaking loved this Shane and Chris and Ryland!! 🥰 And jeffree of course . Absolutely stunning home jeffree loved it. Can't wait to have my entire eyesight be my own property or Acreage.
I don’t think YouTube is dead! I think beauty YouTube is dead! And I think old YouTube has changed. The old guard is gone if you will.
I still watch YouTube 😢 daily
I love YouTube.
I want more! These series be lit!
shane, you need to work on the pacing of the videos
Jeffree, all you upload is reveal videos for ur brand. Try uploading reviews again and see what happens. Love ur brand but look how much views Shane gets for these videos of YOU!! This should be ur barometer.
Haunting series with jeffree coming soon????
I would never have found my love for makeup and YouTube without Jeffree Star’s videos. I care and I still watch. I look forward to new videos. I don’t care for TikTok because they are too short and cold and uncaring and unhelpful. I am very saddened by this
I used to be a keen watcher of Jeffree vids. We were there for the content he was giving. As soon as he changed his life his content changed as well. Most of his followers were there for the beauty content. Like them I'm really not interested in yaks and guns. The audience totally changed.
Please Shane and Ryland do not quit youtube even if others do! we all love watching your videos!
I understand where Jeffree is coming from. But as a fan of Jeffree, Shane, Ryland and all the extended people I've grown to love, it's going to be hard to see anyone leave. I still search for them by name and keep up with thier videos. I don't agree with him thinking no one cares, because we do, BUT, I support him doing what makes him happy. And Shane, you better not go anywhere!! Please! 😆
Jeffree's new life is such a dream. Truly life goals.
Shane kept asking Jeffrey what he does all day and it’s literally what we all want to know yet he thinks it’s time to leave YouTube just when his life has become this totally different and interesting thing. A day in the life of Jeffrey from Shane’s standpoint again would be another cool full circle moment.
Shane doc and Pewdiepie subscriber war was YouTube last peak and both ended in drama and cancellations.   YouTube is not the free space it used to be. That’s why people are not caring anymore.
It actually made me sad and brought tears to my eyes when Jeffree said no one watches or cares about YouTube anymore. I’m not sure that’s true. I know people watch and care. I sincerely hope Shane, Ryland, Jeffree, Morgan and others realize they still have a fan base watching. 💜💜💜
SHANE YOU BETTER NEVER QUIT YOUTUBE…. I never watch Netflix or anything . You are my comfort 😢😢❤❤❤
All the millenialls out there as Jeffree, Shane, also me... are saying goodbye to Youtube... END OF AN ERA.
I have to admit I am so sad. I will miss him on youtube. I still watch and go on youtube all of the time and I know alot of other people who still do too.
I have not finish this but you can tell Jeffery is so happy and he is GLOWING!
I still pick YouTube over streaming networks. If I get sick my comfort isn’t Disney plus it’s YouTube.
youtube brings me out of my depression
I’m in literal tears right now. Hearing Jeffree is done with YouTube hurts.🥺 The best wishes for him though and hope everything goes well!❤️ Will of course still support you on TikTok and everywhere else!😊
Still love watching all of my new favs and my childhood favs. I don't think YouTube sucks :(
Love that Jeffree has found peace. Really love your work Shane.  Also, Jeffree is wrong about no one caring. I come onto YouTube and constantly am looking to see if y’all have uploaded.  I know these comments aren’t being seen by y’all anymore but damn…maybe y’all don’t have the numbers you once did but y’all still have followers.
SHAYNE AND JEFFREE GHOST HUNTING TOGETHER YES PLEASE
I love YouTube. But I'm 36 lol I'm gonna miss Jeffree
I still love YouTube I rather watch YouTube than Tv. I hope you and ryland still plan to stay a while I look forwards to you guys❤
Love this Episode so much, I was a lil confused w/the 1st part but excited. Lots of info, thank u! I'm so excited for all of u for all ur new adventures & life changes.Jeffrey done w/youtube kinda floored me tho! But maybe it's time for a new princess i guess, idk?????I do love my YouTube so much watch it Every Day!!!! I even get mad when my people dont post wkly. I dabble a little bit w/tictok but I love the long stories/vlogs here!!!! I wish u'all much luck & happiness 🥰
But YouTube isn't dying though...just the beauty community died. We come to YouTube to be escape the stress of reality and there for a long while it was like drama after drama after drama...I think people just got tired of the messiness...then that combined with the  community could only watch so many how to tutorials- Jeffree was right on that front- *it's been done*...then combine THAT with the fact we hit a pandemic and we couldn't afford to be interested in the same hobbies we used to be. We couldn't collect make-up when we could barely collect groceries- and for many of us,  that lack of cash is still hitting us hard. Watching was no longer just a reminder of a life style we couldn't ever achieve for fun- but a reminder of parts of a life style we had and didn't anymore...beauty community died, but we're all still here desperately escaping reality on YouTube...just..many of us aren't watching Jeffree anymore.
Sorry CHRIS not Ryland?!?!?!?!?!
Thanks 🙏🏼
I noticed a lot of my favorite YouTubers  stopped posting as often. Some quit. I also noticed the views. Before they’d have millions now they have couple 100k. It really is sad. I use to be on YT all day. :(
‘As long as you don’t use they/them you’ll be fine’ got me 😂 never heard Wyoming explained so well
i don’t have tik tok and i never want it. i always get on youtube and watch my faves i will be so upset if jeffree actually leaves…i promise there’s a bunch of us who actually do care and watch and for some like myself, this is the only way we stay in the know
Im not a nobody. I still love watching youtube videos. I feel like the quality has decreased. There isnt as much to watch..... like all the creators have burnt out.
noooooooo i so disagree with “no one’s watching YouTube anymore” and this video alone is a testament to that
Feels like the end of an era. I'm genuinely sad. I know people grow up and change...just hard to say goodbye.
I love your friendship with Jeffree ❤️. I'm so happy for all of you!! Wyoming has done something magical to Jeffree - he seems so much lighter 😇.. and Star Ranch looks like paradise 🦬..
The entire Conspiracy palette was such a great time in my own life…waiting week after week for the new episode and feeling like I was part of something really historic that so many people were talking about. Just a really great era, if you ask me.
Jeffrey is not wrong about YT, the Beauty space is done, drama channels are done. Rich is hanging on, but only because he doesn't slam on anyone (except for maybe Travis Scott)... Live streams are in, True Crime, Sovereign Citizen...heck, lawyers (aka "LawTube") streaming 9 hours a day during the Depp/Heard trial, were getting big numbers...over 100,000 some days, upwards to 300,000 for a couple of them...but YT & Twitter really go hand in hand right now and that is dark....
Omfg I’ve never laughed so damn hard 😂😂😂
Paranormal video you guys
Nooooo! I love you tube! I watch Jeffree star videos daily. They are older ones but I love them.
I realize that YouTube may not be “cool” anymore. The younger generations are into that instant gratification that tt brings them. However, just like Shane, Ryland and literally MILLIONS of other people, I won’t ever download that app. The content there just isn’t fulfilling to me. I literally watch YouTube every single night in bed like most people watch tv. I disagree with JS that it’s over. It may be evolving, but it definitely is not over.
Amazing how things changed😮❤ way better vibes 🥰
Jeffree is soo fine.
Just the “theme music” alone, when the credits scroll is iconic and sounds like something that would play on some popular television shows. You are such a great editor and your artistry could easily move over to film and television. You’re an artist, Shane!  Ps I was never a YouTuber, you, Ryland and Bailey Sarian are the only people I follow. You’re amazing and draw me in with every video!!
I WANT A SHANE X JEFFREE GHOST HUNTING VIDEO RIGHT NOW
I still love YouTube and watch every day 🥺
I literally watch youtube more than TV. This is my outlet. I hope jeffree is wrong about youtube dying off.
Honestly, that didn't even feel like an almost 1hr video! When I ended, I leaned back and thought "wait what the f*ck?!" then checked the progress bar. Lol I could have sat through another hour, no problems 🤣🤣
I have always watched Youtube and Jeffree Star was one of the first person I watched.  So sad to hear that he doesn’t think anybody watches him anymore
Ghost hunt pleasee
I’ve been to that airport a ton of times and it’s ligit the smallest airport ever 😂
YouTube is dead. Getting harder to find something good to watch.
he just posted two days ago like there’s no way he’s leaving youtube
Youtube is still the best platform. I love watching Youtube videos.
love and support to you all
This is the only channel I open YouTube for and I find enjoying and comfort watching shane and Ryland just living their life. I've been watching Shane ever since I was in 5th grade now I'm in College. Every series bring me joy
I’m not surprised Jeffree is quitting YouTube and I get what he’s saying about it not being like it used to. It has gotten sadder over the years but I still hardcore look forward to the maybe four channels I still watched! Those two years where Shane didn’t upload was the saddest time in my life
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Jeffree!!!! NO!!!!!!
Always fun watching Shane and Jeffree together! I’m smiling and laughing with everyone.  I disagree with Jeffree with Youtube, ironically here watching this video now. X3 But whatever he wants to do, it’s his choice, wish him the best in all that he does!  Would be so much fun if the gang did something spooky when in Wyoming together. Be fun to learn to learn about haunted hot spots there.
damn.
I still love Jeffree no matter what 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I love YouTube😫
Absolutely love how passionate & respectful Jeffery is about Wyoming ❤️❤️
nooo I still watch youuuu :(
same i still stand for youtube and all my fav content creators 😭
the old lady in the background at 17:18 looked so bothered lmao
Do what makes you happy ❤️ it's not worth it to do otherwise
YOUTUBE ISNT DYINNG ITS LEARNING MAKEUP THAT DIED. tiktok mainly does quick transitions for that instant gratification. there no learning or showing the journey there like it was a back then for makeup tutorials. please dont give up. I wish tiktok would end. youtube is so important. it shows personality. realness. rawness. tiktok doesnt show that.
The moment yall reunited i felt a wholeness and i laughed so hard throughout the entire video up until the end. I hit me really hard hearing that jeffree is going to quit YT. its really inspiring to see jeffree living such a more peaceful life doing what he loves and enjoys but The moment that Shane leaves youtube is the day i delete youtube forever because his content is what i grew up watching from day one. Love you all sm and im dying for part 3.
Shane better not ever quit YouTube! I’ve been watching every single video since he started!! SD army like whatttt I’d cry so hard 😩😩 his videos temporarily stop my depression 😂😂 and the podcast is sooo good !
You really are a great film maker Shane. I hope you are proud of what you do. I certainly enjoy your efforts, including ryland's  AND jeffree's
I don’t think YouTube has gone away that drastic….or am I loser I go on everyday 😂
Jeffree really is spot on. I do not see any videos on YouTube getting 30 million views anymore. Tiktok is taking over but it's not a platform to dive deep or to create content like this. It's sad 😞
Shane, I just want you to know that I love your videos so much. YouTube is my escape. Thank you for these amazing videos ad series. It take a lot of guys that be so open and vulnerable. I'm so proud of you and how far you have come. I will always be a huge fave of you. Ryland, I love your videos to. You bring me so much joy. I love how Hines and just really you are. There aren't many truly really people left and I thank oi for being truthful to yourself and not letting the world of social media get you down. Im so glad to see everyone enjoying life and doing what ever makes them happy. Life is about being happy and living your life the way you want to. Keep being true to yourselves because y'all are amazing. Lots of love ❤❤❤
I still love YouTube by the way ♥️
This hit me in the feels. I still love YouTube so so much it's by far my favorite social media. So glad Shane is back
It hurts to hear “ YouTube is dead”. I’m here supporting only my favorite creators. I don’t even have a tik tok, or insta, or whatever other social media exists out there because its so much shit all at once. When I’m on YouTube its my time to relax, enjoy and get entertained with things I actually want to see. It sucks Jefree feels that way, but if thats how he finds more enjoyment in life then good for him, proud of jefree for taking that step!
I love this new Jeffree Star!! How humble he has become
the editing and going back and forth is so confusing
Wooow, I’m literally crying.! We’re all glowing and growing! Cheers to the happy life!🎉❤
Jeffrey looks so 1000 times much happier & that makes me happy but I'm sad that he's leaving I love rewatching all yall videos! & I'm so excited to see yall together again
I literally watch YouTube more than anything else 😢
Please don’t stop posting your story to YouTube !!! I love watching you Jeffree
I happy for Jeffree but I disagree about YouTube being dead. It’s 95% of what I watch and love.
Tiktok needs to stop. Its so easy to make things look easy to do and get that instant gratification within seconds. we never learn anymore we are never there watching makeup for the journey. just before and afters. i hope youtube will make a come back. im still here.
Crazy I’m not a consumer of TikTok and still obsessed with YT content. It’s sad some creators don’t love it anymore 😢 but I def see the drop in viewership tho compared to short form content
ugh i love you shane
Jeffrey say no one click on YouTube anymore me wait for the next episode like hurry up hehehe
Um, I watch YouTube every day…
I love YouTube. I don’t care for tv and movies
I am so, so sad that Jeffree thinks no one uses Youtube anymore. It's my main source of media, always will be. I hate tiktok. I don't like instagram. FB isn't free enough. I'm clicking :(
omg wait I still watch YouTube videos when im on break... am I the only one??
I will never stop watching YouTube!!!
YouTube may not be as poppin as it used to be but there are a lot of loyal YouTube lovers like me who’s literally been following Shane, Jeffree and the other OG’s since their first videos when I was a kid. It literally doesn’t matter where or what they’re doing, I’ll always care and follow. My dream is to meet them. They meant more to me than any Hollywood stars. I’ve grown with them and I’m 25 now. Thank you for continuing Shane. You mean so much more to me than you could ever know. There’s times I’ve had the worst anxiety attacks and crying my eyes out and Shane and Jeffree never failed to lift my spirit.  I know you’re done Jeffree and it’s totally understandable. You’ve accomplished so freaking much and you’ve had to deal with so much hate and cruelty from people. I’m thankful you’ve stuck around this long. I’d ask you to reconsider out of selfishness but you deserve complete, total peace and happiness. Love you ❤ thank you, truly.
I watch YouTube SO much. I really hope more creators don’t leave it:(
I'm clicking damn it
Jeffree looks more beautiful now ❤️
Anyone else just loving this so much that it makes you wanna go back and watch the videos from 4 years ago??? Or is it just me ❤❤❤
Ohhhh my this is a lot of emotions in this video for starters the fact of you and jeffree Lynn in a video makes my heart explode with happiness and I need more so much more of it. Also sadness because of the absolute bull shit y’all went through and now the fact that jeffree is quitting YouTube is not what I was prepared for but I’m so happy that he is happy and I’m so happy for you and Ryland and to see y’all came out on the other side with happiness and love for each other is all y’all’s true fans really want to see. Sending so much love to all of y’all
My boyfriend is so mad he didn’t name his arcade “the Starcade “ 😂
Love seeing this part of Jeff and everything he has gone through! Thank u Shane for showing us this! 🤍
J.S. may be done but there are millions of us still here watching and clicking.  I feel like he is really shitting on the people who are still here, still loyal to creators.  If that is how he feels,'Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out!. As Shane is learning, if you create it people will come.
He just casually has a mostly-vegan makeup line yet has yak farm that sells meat to external vendors, interesting
We need this palette to launch! For us please… you guys have grown so much 🥲🥲🥲 we will still be here for y’all!
Ive waited to see this video and it was so good and funny and when Jeffrey announced that he was quitting Utube....man I literally felt so sad 😢....I'm on utube more than any other social media and I love Shane , Ryland and Jeffrey Star .....he does work so hard and he does deserve the best of life
I don't buy that youtube is dead. I got tired of jeffree's content because it felt repetitive but I'm on here almost every night to watch the stuff I like.
I mean he is right, the only reason I watch on this app is because of Jeffrey and Shane. I don’t have anything else that I care to watch.
Ahhhhh I miss the old YT days. Jeffree will definitely be missed!! 😢❤ Love this series so much! It is what the true fans really wanted. Love you both.
Me: *caring very much* 🥺🥺
I’m shocked that Jefree is leaving YouTube.. like woah! That makes me sad.. I’m more sad that he thinks that no one cares and no one watches it. It’s not true! I get a notification and I’ll watch it when I’m able to. I may not be the first and I may not watch it that same day it comes out but I’ll click it if I’m interested. I have notifications set up and I eagerly wait to see my few YouTubers post content. I don’t think he should leave completely but maybe change it up, I mean I’m not really a huge fan of the make up videos but that’s just me. Maybe if that’s where the lowest views r then find something else to do but we do love u and care! :(
While watching honestly I'm smiling and happy, my excitement is with you guys when it's time for you guys to see each other again.  I don't care about the drama involve coz hey it's part of life, who doesn't have drama in life. And F the cancel culture coz I as far as I'm concern, when the fruit is bearing fruits people intent to throw stones to get the ripe fruit. Congratulations on this video! I'm always a fan watching from the other side of the world and I enjoy you guys from the beginning till now. ❤
Cremated was and is that bitch🔥🔥 Im going to miss Jeffriees youTube channel
Why do I want to cry !! 😢 YouTube watching my favorite people are the only thing that’s been the same in this crazy world 🌎
I do care and do watch always
It's crazy to see how chill jeffree is now
i always forget you guys moved to Denver XD im excited to see what you and jeffree are gunna do XD  forget all the drama starters we all done fucked up shit in our past xD even the people who start the drama its just now people are getting soft and cant accept people change but thats there fault they cant move on and drop the past XD oh wel!!!!!!!!
I hope jeffree sees how much that comment made everyone feel. A lot of us have different outlets. Not all of us are rich, and we sometimes like to live vicariously through our favorite youtubers.. at least I know I do. I’m not even a 3rd into my life with a chronic illness that makes me feel chronic pain everyday. I fear when YouTube dies, others will too.
I can't believe Jeffreis quitting YouTube.  I'm so sad now
I’ve always looked at Jeffree as a very feminine beauty, but for some reason he’s giving off masculine vibes and all I can say is I’d fuck him 😂
At 23:49 that’s athens, ga not wyoming lolol
The fact that jeffree doesn’t want to make YouTube videos because he thinks people don’t care makes me sad. I care. I know it’s tough, but I promise people do care
Maybe nobody watches jeffree as much anymore instead of all YouTube, just sayin.
What makes me sad about Jeffree quitting is that I don’t want to be on Tik Tok to in order to see his content. I wish Shane and Jeffree would continue to do a series on a more long term basis.
jeffree looks so happy
I love this series!!❤❤❤ missed you guys!
I would have loved to seen Jeffree give one of his purses to Rich Lux, he would’ve been over the moon with joy. I would love to see this turn into a 10 part series!
Theres so much going on here! I think there are still people who are on Youtube (obviously) and I'm not one who is a massive fan of Tiktok. I have it and use it sometimes or Instagram reals but short format videos have their place but nothing will ever replace Youtube for me. There's a lot more depth and community imo. I still think you can do both! Use Tiktok as the short fun stuff or for teasers for Youtube but honestly Tiktok gets boring and there's not a great way to find the content that I like.
This is the best thing literally ever. So proud of y’all
I LOVE YOU ON YOUTUBE :( I will miss you and I don’t really like TikTok :( im here and really love it love it love it
I love of how the hobbit is playing on the TV when they arrive to jeffree's house 😂💞
Next video please
He’s there for tax reasons mostly….. I don’t blame him. But hopefully he realizes what brings true happiness in life.
I’m sad that you’re leaving YouTube. But I still watch it I’ve been to watch it when my son goes to sleep I enjoy watching it your guys videos brings me joy and laughter the Comedy that you guys have
Has anyone purchased these sheets from Buffy? Want to know the real quality of the product? Is it worth the money? They are expensive! But u hate sleeping and being hot 😓
As long as you all are happy and healthy, that is all that matters. No matter what you guys do, or where life takes you. Those of us who genuinely care will follow along on the parts of your journeys that you choose to share, and continue cheering you on from the sidelines!
All I watch is Youtube, I pay for premium because Youtube is still my main source of content. It's still where so many of us go for a proper escape. We're still here and we still care, but I get that the numbers just aren't the same for anyone, especially the beauty community
OKURR
I’m sad to hear Jeffree is done with YouTube. I would love to watch Jeffrees new life on the ranch vlog style videos
Just off of work, eating pizza, andddddddd watching Shane! Perfect end to my day
my heart is so sad that Jeffree is quiting youtube😭 anytime I see that he has posted a video, i ALWAYS watch it!  plz shane and ryland, don’t quit! my heart couldn’t take it!
YouTube is my comfort app, I miss how much my favorite YouTubers use to upload 😭
I am so happy you guys are back together once again. Super excited about the series and really hope there is a pallet coming out. I still care about you guys and still support and still watch today! Please do not quit YouTube, Jeffery :((
I still watch YouTube. It’s less brainwashy than tik tok. Tik too is the more toxic if the socials :(
Jefferee is finally living his life. I love it. Nice little peek into his happily ever after.
calm peaceful jeffree all day plz ✌️id love to watch a youtube channel of his day to day life in wyoming
Shane don’t you dare think about leaving YouTube I will cry everynight
I love how healthy Jeffree looks, he’s a new person ( no longer shallow) and Shane, you light up around him, it’s good to see you guys happy
I Love that he’s at peace and happy now! He will always be a legend in YouTube community. There’s no one like Jeffree Star ⭐️ I’m so happy for the comfort and happiness. Luv ya Jeffree
Shane shop in the women’s section for pants next time pls 😅thanx
I absolutely love this!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this series SO much!!!!!! It’s so much fun to see you and Jeffree together!! I just want to hang out with you guys you are so much fun together! You both seem so genuinely happy in your lives and it shows!!! I can’t wait to watch it again!!!!! I really needed this it’s been a hard week!!!! Thank you ❤❤
Jeffree looks so amazing with natural brows. PRETTY!❤
Im sad to see Jeffree leave YT too - but him leaving is not selfish or him ‘not caring about his fans.’ If there is a platform better suited for him - his fans should support him in that transition. 🤷‍♀️   He got famous from MySpace. MySpace could’ve been the last anyone ever heard of: “Jeffree Star” - hell, it was the end for so many of his equally popular peers. His self awareness, ability to adapt, evolve, re-learn & try new things - is what made him so successful long term.   If anyone understands social media, trends, evolving - not only products but also platforms & content — its Jeffree. I’m not on TikTok but I’m sure he’s killing it. He’s always been ahead of the game with social media. Congrats Jeffree! 🎉
JEFFREE!!! NOOOOOOOOO DONT QUIT!!! I’ll die… 😂
It’s crazy I looked at Jeffery and was huh something so different about him then realized he has brows ❤️
Literally maybe I’m different but I’ve been so loyal to YouTube ever since I was a teenager. 15 years! And I watch YouTube way way more than tv, Netflix, movies ect. It’s like I grew up watching you guys. I care. I was so happy to watch this video. Like it’s the highlight of my day. Even I was into TikTok for a couple of years, and I recently quit it because I can’t stand to watch a 10-30 sec video and scroll for hours. I feel it’s not healthy. But for me YouTube will always be the goat. I will never quit watching YouTube. I think just maybe every app is slowly dying as humans were going through a crisis and we all know being on our phone all day is not healthy. But I never once cared about you guys being canceled. Because I grew up with you I felt like I knew you guys. But I think it’s healthy for Jeffery to leave and I know he will be fine in whatever he does. But if shane quit I would be terribly sad. I love your videos. I always look forward to them. I haven’t laughed this much in weeks. So thank you for coming back and continuing to produce content. I’ll always support you
I don't know how to feel after watching this but i deffinately can't wait for part 3
I love to watch you tube. It may not be for Jefree but many of us love it.
Jeffrey looks good ! No makeup and eye brows
Jeffree bluntly and so matter of factly saying he is quitting YouTube....hit me square in the face and broke my heart at the same time
I will forever be a Jeffree stan ❤️❤️
Did he change the name of the videos? 🤔
although I understand the need to move on… just know that I come to YouTube specifically for you, Ryland, Jeffery, and Morgan. It’s the high light of my day. Everyday after work I cook and play you’re videos. So know, that we’re still out here and you still make us happy ❤️
I love that Jeffree has found true, soul deep happiness. I couldn't be happier for him, he deserves it!! I will miss his YouTube videos but he hasn't made videos like his old videos in so many years now, it's nothing surprising that he is leaving YouTube. And the good news is that if we want to see him, we can just open another app. He lived his life online for years and it's best for him to continue living his life for himself, not for views. I thinks it's great! And if he ever wants to jump in again, his long-term fans will be here to watch.
I think we can all admit, that besides the cancellations and drama and the beauty world, we all went through and experienced the height of it all and then entered into the pandemic and honestly, it really changed everyone. I’ve been watching Shane’s old taste testing videos and it’s crazy how much YouTube has evolved. I’m eager to see what happens next with this lot.
JEFFERY NOOO I CLICKKKKKK!!!!!!
Love all these vibes 💕💛 But man, the end of this video is kinda making me mad... because I personally don't use TikTok, I ONLY watch YouTube... and Shane, Ryland & Morgan (and the whole fam) have gotten me through so much these past few years. 💯  And I feel like their/"our" community is so supportive & genuinely happy these days... Like, I think there's a LOT of genuinely nice people that still watch YouTube. The comment sections aren't as vicious anymore.   So, I have no shame in sticking with YouTube. And I hope Jeffree's own personal view of YouTube.... isn't making Shane & Ryland think twice about leaving this community they've built... just to make more views/money elsewhere.  I'm sure Jeffree has his own reasons that he'll obviously talk about in Part 3, so let's see! I just don't want Shane to feel pressured to follow suit 😕
I love how ryland is just sitting on the ground with the dogs
The thing is, I don't even have tiktok. I still stay on Youtube.
/Raises hand....I watch YouTube for fun! My heart dropped when Jeffree said he's done with YouTube. I mean he needs to do what makes him happy... But I'm freaking sad
fuck this is so heartbreaking, as soon as Jeffree said he's quitting youtube, ughh, fuck.
Please don’t quit Shane! People still watch!
I love how it is less than a four hour drive from Denver to Casper and they flew.
Jeffree I still watch your videos on YouTube and I watch you on Snapchat. I wish I could meet you, and Shane and Ryland.
The music was kinda loud i cant hear u guyz
I feel like that’s why Shane has been off a little with all of this, cuz he’s thinking about it too, it’s sad I miss the way things use to be I’ll miss Jeffree too.
Jeffree I know you probably won’t read this but I still watch your videos I did not know you were on TikTok and I love TikTok so I am going to follow you on TikTok but I still watch your YouTube videos.Shane and ryland I love you
I don’t watch much YouTube anymore. I only came to YouTube tonight to watch this series. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Jeffree has a point.
Wow this is so crazy for me and my family. My mom and sisters actually watch YouTube like it’s TV and we are always waiting on a Jeffree Star video to come out. It’s so sad he thinks people don’t care or enjoy his videos anymore, cause I know at least 4 people, including myself that love him. I think there’s a lot more people that feel the same way. But I do understand whatever makes him happy he should do. We won’t stop loving him but I really will miss his videos  and him saying “welcome back to my channel, ✨ Hi how are ya?!” Hopefully he will come back to YouTube though in the future! Love you Jeffree ❤️
It’s crazy that Jeffrey can get millions of views a video and think no one watches or cares anymore
Shane has so much admiration for Jeffree that I think there’s a sense of envy (in the most reasonable manner) that J can cut out this part of his life and move on.   YouTube has been Shane’s identity for years that who wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t know how to move forward with something that truly can’t last forever? Like any relationship, that’s so fucking tough.  He’ll hear what he needs to hear, and be stronger for it. And until then, I’ll continue watching these two joke around 30 million times on my own if it means they’re happier
I still love coming home and watching YouTube 😢 I wish more people would post like back in the day
Ok … kinda mad that he keeps leaving it on cliff hangers… I get it totally but why😅😅😅 I need more
I'm still on YouTube so much that I guess I didn't even realize or think about it becoming something no one cares about anymore. Because I still care. I watch YouTube all the time 🥺
Wait no Jeffery, I live for YouTube! Still go look for y’all posting videos EVERYDAY!!🤍
I love the vibes of y’all hanging out so much 😭😭 I would love a Shane & Jeffry & ryland ghost adventure
Ooh I love the very end with the song, good editing 👌🏼
Jeffree saying no one cares about YouTube anymore makes me sad. I’m literally on YouTube ALL day and it brings me joy 😅
Ugh that hit me! I love Jeffrees videos whenever a new one is uploaded I click it as fast as possible! I am on YouTube every day still watching videos and even rewatching. He is going to be missed…. I hope we don’t lose Shane and Ryland too…. I wouldn’t have much purpose to go on here after that.😢
This brings me back to a happy place. Before Covid. Before cancellation culture. Just happy.
I was sad to hear jeffree will be ending his time on YouTube. But I completely understand. But I am someone who watches and love the platform. Yes I have other streaming platforms but YouTube is the one platform I watch more then any other
Did he make him change the title lol
Idk about YouTube being dead. Every time I come across a poll of "what do you watch most?!" YouTube is always overwhelming the most watched. It beats Netflix and Hulu and Paramount by a LOT. I'm wondering if he's talking in general or just the beauty community on YouTube is dead?
Don’t quit YouTube:(
I would be so sad if Jeffree would actually quit YouTube… I’m one of the ones who does go back to rewatch videos for the fun of it. I love you both so much!❤️❤️❤️  I would hate to see it end 😭💔
Love you Shane !!
Call it nostalgia or cancellation
Love this jeffree SO MUCH
I was so NOT ready for that to be over!
Jeffree looks like he can finally breathe. Love seeing you all together. 🤍
the day that colleen and ryland quit youtube is the day that I delete this app
Jeffree nooooooo you cannnnNOT leave us
YouTube is an outlet for me. I watch it constantly everyday. Don’t ever stop creating Shane and Ryland! Love you all. ❤
Why did you rename it??
Jeffrey is so real, idky he gets so much hate. I love his vibe. IMSO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT EP
Just release it anyways ❤
This is so sad. He has literally been half of my lifetime.. but I see the numbers.. just sad😢
Shane holding the gun😂
I love this series, it's sad to see Jeffree leave YouTube. I've loved him through everything since I was in Highschool and he was the face of myspace!  I'm hoping this ends in you guys releasing the pallet you loved and we're so excited. I would 1000% throw my money at y'all again! That pallet is still one of my favorite things ever!
DY-NO-MITE
please please please do a ghost investigation in Wyoming please please please!!!!
That's why Shane is the Best of the Best!❤️ My 2 Favorit You Tubers again together! No Jefree we care and we're Watching YouTube!
Jeffree's latest video Psychedelic Circus currently has 564k views. That's not "nobody". People are still watching but I guess not compared to before. I don't know why everyone is on Tiktok. I don't think I'll ever create an account. YouTube > Every other social media.  YouTube is making some changes now. Soon we will probably contact other users and connect with them easier.
Jeffree made me cry when he said hes quitting YouTube like fuck man... There is A LOT of people still watching YouTube. PLEASE DON'T GOO@@@@@@ NOOOOOOOOO PLEASE STAY
Jeffree pls don’t quit YouTube
Omg I love Shane & Jeffree! This made me soooo happy 😍
I'm guilty of leaving negative comments but after seeing this side of Jeffery he has won me back as a fan he looks so beautiful natural and living in a normal house really brings him to a more relatable area for me a middle aged mom.
This series is making my heart feel warm❤️ so glad to see both of y’all just genuinely happy. Also really did wonder what happened to all the bags and pinball machines so thanks for that
We need a spooky Wyoming series for surrreeeee
You're right about YouTube. I used to watch so many people, now I only watch a couple of gaming channels, one family vlog channel and that's it. I barely watch any YouTube now!
the “once the depression stopped the Pomeranians stopped” 😭 literally me i have 8 dogs
Literally one million views consistently on his videos. I don't think a million of us is "no one". But I do think he should walk away if it feels right to him.
I WATCH EVERY VIDEO JEFFREE WTFFFF
Jeffrey is so fucking right tho. YouTube is not as important as it nice was
I hope you guys get to do part two palette make up no I still watch you both on YouTube 😞❤❤❤❤🤗🙏
all the emotions in this one.. I laughed.. I cried.. <3
None of these comments have replies… 🤔
Other channels would be demonatized for the pistol stuff
I’m still watching 😢
If you guys dont make a haunted video im suing!!!
I'm still watching YouTube and I still love you guys! These videos are my happy place. This is where I go when the world is too much.
I like YouTube….
girl give us an hour + episode don't be shy
I'm so excited for this series!
I think you guys should still release the palette & it should be called “Cancelled” for #CancelledPalette. I love it!
Damn, I still watch!!
Looking forward to the “Cancelled Pallet” 😉
I’ll miss Jeffree on YouTube 😢 I definitely still watch YouTube every day & Jeffree and Shane are my 2 favorites so I really hope Shane continues YouTube 🫶🏻
Shane is such a precious site on take off and landing🤭
You guys had me laughing so much! I love you guys! ❤
Im loving this Jeffree Star !!!! ❤
I agree, youtube isnt the same anymore for beauty creators, tik tok really is thriving on the viewership. But tiktok will never have what youtube has and thats loyal supporters. Anyone can gain 1million on tiktok but look at the meet and greets, look at the support, it doesnt compare to the youtube community. Tiktok is way to saturated, and i dont go on tik tok to go on my ‘follower page’ i go on my fyp to look at dumb videos and then forget bc we have no connection with creators. Youtube is more personal and intimate which feels like we are best friends with the creators. Its really really different. And tiktok has more hate comments then youtube.
Someday I’ll have that many pinball machines! I currently have two with one on the way!
I miss the old videos. These videos are so LGBT oriented and intrested in celebrities that do not intrest all of us. Looks like a propaganda. I miss the candid fesh conspiration theory videos. Sorry
“No one cares about YouTube” while me and all my friends binge watch YouTube videos haha the energy y’all have when together is the best
YouTube is the platform the i most use to watch stuff what are u talking about jeffreeee
I love your friendship. It’s so comfortable. Jeffree found himself in life. I love his carefree outlook. Thank you for sharing ❤
i love thins series. i love shane and jeffree together. i’ll never stop watching
I literally started crying when jeffree said he’s quitting yt
Only jeffree could make canceled cool 😂
Huh? YouTube isn’t dead… This is my daily, most consumed app!!! 🤷‍♀️
Bring me to the Yaks
Iove Jeffree and Shane sooo much !!
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Holy hell how much did that uber cost? What a lucky driver to have you all aboard!! I would have loved that journey!!
Nothing like a Shane and Jeffree series!!!! ❤️
🥰 Jeffree, is your skincare REALLY all you use on your skin?
im 30 minutes in and Jeffree was the spooky boy addition I was not prepared for hahaha 💕
If jeffree quits YouTube I will have no reason to live
The song is the same in the transit love 2 and I'm living for it
I smiled the entire way through until the end then I started sobbing
For some reason it's like, this is the first time like I'm seeing the real Jeffree. He seems like he needs this.
legit had to go search up if Jeffree has been posting and he has!! So who's gonna go get the views going on in his channel? cause me too. Also I don't think the problem was the streaming sites I think it was TIKTOK. It made so people get quick reviews in less than 15 seconds. A whole makeup video in 1 min. Compared to a 15-30 min make up video on YouTube. Times have changed. But I do hope we all come back to YouTube \
I’m still here !!!!😢😢😢
I watch YouTube still every single day ❤🎉
Sad to hear that he's thinking of quitting YouTube. Hopefully he changes his mind 🤞. I enjoy watching long content personally. I watch YT vids anywhere, at home, work, traveling, etc. Am I the only one that doesnt watch Tiktok? Creators are clouded by the multi millions of views they get on Tiktok and its just sad. YT is not dead🧟‍♀️
I still watch YouTube and always will!
Holy shit….well Jeffrey, I guess as you say YouTube sucks!!! Lol, will see…😅
SHANE PLEASE DO A SPOOKY SERIES IN WISCONSIN
I'm simultaneously happy for Jeffree and also I'll miss him. And he said exactly what I was thinking. He's leaving like Jenna. I really will miss him.
Jeffree has amazing taste in firearms, I mean he really does. It's one of the best lying around collections I've ever seen. I can only imagine what he's got in the safe.
I totally agree with jeffree!!! I did YouTube for a lil bit on another small channel and I had so much fun with it. DIYs. But I got bored. I was sick of doing the same thing over and over and over again. So I deleted it. It was time to move on and focus on my life’s dream to be a mom
I think a lot of viewers still watch YouTube, like myself. But, if it's no longer bringing joy and peace to Jeffree, I can totally understand him leaving and fully support. If it makes sense for him, it makes sense. 🙅🏼‍♀
Ended shane
What a shocker...jeffree will quit YT
I feel like the new pallet name will be “cancelled”
I like the new Jeffree.
Posting this comment because I wanna see how long it could possibly last w Shane filtering through them to make sure only the good ones are at the top
I still mostly ONLY watch YouTube! I hardly Go on other apps! Long live YouTube lol.
I’m still here watching on YouTube. I started actually watching videos in 2012 when I was pregnant with my first son. I was watching pewdiepie, Roman Atwood and fousey. Then Jenna & shane became my obsession. I was hooked after finding them and discovering more creators. ❤ hearing Jeffree say it’s dead, is quite sad to me. Makes me feel old for one haha 😅 but it’s not dead. I’m still watching and still a fan. I live for Shane uploads and would love a haunted series with Jeffree! 🎉
I’m always on YouTube. Ya tripping. Don’t quit Jeffree!!
Does Jeffree hire someone to do maintenance on all 600 acres or only certain areas?
After watching you guys for years… and living in Casper… it is STILL SO WILD to me to see you guys in my town. I’ve ran into Jeffree twice. I wish I would have met you too!
OmG😮😢 nooooo. I don’t have TikTok. I love you guys videos. I’ve been watching since my kids are babies. It is sad however it makes him happy and I’ll be happy for him too.
IDGAFF  Shane and clan with Jeffrey is my favorite thing ever. I just wanna hang out everyday doing crazy shit and laughing with them haha
Can’t wait for the next episode!!
Jeffreeeee. We care.
“No one’s ever seen my bedroom.. I mean😬” lmaooo
24:45 Jeffree explaining the simple life has made him happy really got me sentimental 🥲♥️ We all deserve to be at peace some day
Hey I’m still YouTube obsessed!! But I do know what he means but YouTube isn’t dead.
Ok Jeffree can quit YouTube but you and Ryland can absolutely not 😅
Shane you kill it with every video. I hope you don't leave youtube even though its dried up there are still people here who get endless entertainment out of all the content produced on this site
I still love YouTube…🤷‍♀️
😢 this break my heart Jeff stop YouTube 😢 even though u and hun are literally only thing I like watching I don’t even watch anything but you guys
Shane looks so much happier 😊.
idc what anyone says. i’m glad you’re back. youtube is your thing and you’re soo soo good at it.
333k views in 4 hours... i do think people are still clicking videos lol. i love jefree though and i hope he's living a happy life, he seems so full of joy and free from all the toxicity. love ya shane and ry! cheers
I support jeffree wanting to quit that makes alot of sense, I support anyone doing whatever they think is going to make them feel better. But we do still enjoy an love watching YouTube videos. I really really love this series, it’s edited an filmed super well. I have been looking forward to each episode. ❤
I love jefree! So much growth 😊
Shane….Please Don’t Quit YouTube!!!
HE LITERALLY DID IT ALL ❤️ I’m crying thinking I’m not gonna see him here anymore 😭😭😭😭 I love you jeffree 💜
I think that’s why YouTube shorts became fire for a minute, to salvage YouTube overall. But ppl need to realize, all these platforms can come and go, until the next idea evolves. Who knows what’s next 🤷‍♀️ It’s not necessarily a bad thing. Plus, Jeffree is working it on Tik Tok…so we shall see! 😊
I care about YouTube!!!!! when Jeffrey started saying no body cares about YouTube anymore nobody sits and watches it for enjoyment I jumped up in my bed and yelled "I DOOOOO WHATTT THEEEE HELLLLL" and woke up everyone in my house its hella late here.
chris said basically what i was saying at like around 8:15 not a read, but werk
Us old people (30+) still like YouTube
i love the energy of this video, i laughed all the time….
Jeffree Star moved to Wyoming so I moved to Wyoming
I still love YouTube 😢💗
I still watch jeffrees and Shane’s channel 24/7. I am that person that still comes home and finds my enjoyment in watching YouTube and forever will! I’m standing for Shane and jeffree till the end!
You saying your cancellation sent his make up to live at TJ Maxx & your still friends really is the definition oh make it through 🥹❤️
Never gave up on you or Jeffree, always loved you guys since day 1 through thick and thin❤️ I'm sad that Jeffree is quitting I don't do TikTok so I was so happy to his vid uploaded ☺️
I love jeffree and it truly breaks my heart that he's hanging up YouTube. You and him both has brought me out of some really dark places in my life.
The pinball pics sent meee😂😂😂💀
The maturity Jeffery has now is such a beautiful thing....Im glad they have moved full circle and now we get this video... Let us have more! Its time⚘
I really hope he changes his mind about quitting YouTube I always enjoy watching his videos maybe he can do other things besides makeup maybe he can tour the different restaurants that use his products maybe he can do a cooking thing at home with his acne heck I would even watch him go grocery shopping as long as he stays on YouTube I just love watching him
All of us who grew up with you are still on YouTube 😢 I have TikTok but I just don’t like it like YouTube 😅 Didn’t even know Jeffree was on it 😅😅 we love you guys ❤
Omfg please release the pallet and call it "canceled" omg also Jeffree has eyebrows
Jeffree looks so good. So genuinely happy and like his authentic self. 💓
So Jeffree has like 600 FOOTBALL FIELDS OF YAKS😭😭😭😭 I hope I get my farm one day🙌
Why did the title get changed from the retirement of Jeffree star?
Shane you are such an amazing person and create videos that I enjoy watching! I know at the end Jeffree says no one is clicking anymore, well maybe not like they used to but I’m not a nobody and I’m still here loving and supporting ❤
Are you kidding, all I watch is YouTube! Not even exaggerating. I work, come home and go on my watch later playlist until it's bedtime lol
the series weve all been waiting for! we live for this duo!
I watch YouTube every single day! Shane and Ryland don’t get any ideas from Jeffree wanting to quit!!!!
I hope JS is serious about leaving YT
This video is my dream come true 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I freaking love Jeffree. Being unapologetically Jeffree. Ef off to everyone who is triggered or upset get the f over that shit.  Literally no1 cares about your feelings they're your responsibility not other people's.
Everyone still watches YouTube. It’s just that Jeffery’s videos are just trying to sell his makeup, rather than doing fun vlogs and incorporating his products organically into them.
his motto being “So?”😭😭😂😂😂💓💓💓
I love that he kept his arcade ❤❤
Love this
Omg nooo I began crying 😢
Yea nobody watches Jeffery YouTube videos tbh
I completely disagree with Jeffree on nobody is watching YouTube. I stay on YouTube and I LIVE FOR THESE VIDEOS!
When Jeffree walked into the airport I felt emotional. What a reunion!  Love them together.
I love that Jeffrey is doing so well but not everyone hates YouTube! Some of us still really look forward to our favorite weekly vloggers or even those who post multiple times a week! Some of us prefer it over the edited reality tv
I love jefrees baddest b in the room struts
How many views does Jefree need? Sorry but getting millions of views all the time isn't realistic. Really bad take on that honestly.
That gun popping out just had my jaw on the floor
Love the growth and lessons learned
WHAT
I don’t think Jeffree should quit YouTube he has over 15 Million followers and each video he has over 500,000 views and that’s on the low views, the rest are over a million. So, a million or half a million people watching Jeffree’s video means no one is watching? He shouldn’t say no one is watching. @Shane don’t even think of leaving YouTube, Ryland don’t even think about it and omg Morgan love her too!
It's sad that YouTube isn't worth it anymore. I still enjoy the videos but I guess there isn't enough reasons to stay. I wish them all success in their endeavors.
Star is right I’m only on YouTube to watch this series 😭
Hi, I’m No One, and I like YouTube still. 🥺 Lol but on a serious note, I’m loving this series so far! Honestly I want to escape city life for the farm life too. Not for the same reasons but honestly, people suck. I’d love to live in a place like Casper. I see how happy Jeffree is now and it inspires me. I hope he continues to live happily, and I hope you are happy too, Shane!
Lol “no one watches YouTube anymore” as we are watching this on YouTube.
If jafar doesn’t want to make YouTube videos anymore it’s because the public isn’t stroking his ego enough
I've miss Shane & Jeffree together bruh
I clicked on here just to watch ur video,  guess I'm a loser
I love you guys so much Jeffery made me cry
Came to comments to see if anyone recognized Athens GA in the b-roll at 23 min
Why is there a silencer on his gun? 😅
Love this content and love the vibe between you and Jeffrey. TikTok is great, but not really my fav and I’ve actually just deleted the app all together. YouTube is my go to and entertains me throughout my day. Shane, Ryan and Morgan are some of my staple content creators, I’d be lost without out you all. I’m so glad to see Jeffrey doing so well in his new environment and can’t wait to see part 2 & 3! Please keep ‘em coming  Shane, we are all still here watching and loving every single moment.
I wasn't expecting that bombshell at the end 😱
Low key Jeffrey. I still watch you and YouTube. I watch it for joy and entertainment. I love watching you but you have to do what’s best for you. You will be missed ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jeffree is soooo gorgeous in his makeup. But is SOOOOOOO FUCKING HOT in his more masculine state
Can we not cancel Shane this time?
All I watch is YouTube! LOL
I just love Jeffree and the growth 💕  it is sad about YouTube tho
Shane I am so excited you're doing another series with Jeffrey the amount of work you put into these is amazing please keep doing more content like this.
I'd just like to say YouTube is the main app I use that I am on all the time but probably because I don't care about what is popular or doing what everyone else is doing. I go on TikTok every couple weeks because I don't like getting sucked into scrolling for hours. I don't have Snapchat, Twitter, or Instagram and I hardly use Facebook at all. I've actually been debating deactivating my account. YouTube is pretty much the only one I care about 🖤💚
What in the 2018 is going on
Pinky’s up! 😂 love it!!
😭 am I the only one who still comes to YouTube to watch things and still enjoys it?😕 what a crazy ending to this episode!!
You tube does not suck its just that we are breaking in to new talent
I still love YouTube.
No one likes either of you
Can't wait for more
I love him though and support him ❤❤😂😂
Jeffree: “no one watches YouTube anymore, no one cares” Me: watching YouTube, caring 👁👄👁
I think for jeffree to say no one cares about YouTube anymore is a bit of a cop out tbh. Like fair enough he’s not getting the views he needs to make enough money for everything he’s doing, but that doesn’t mean everyone should just give up on it because there are so many people, like me, that prefer to watch the longer content rather than just go to tiktok. Only doing makeup content always had the potential of making people bored eventually, but I think for people like Shane and so many others I think it’s still a great platform for them 🤷🏻‍♀️ You can’t say no one cares when a bunch of us are here right now watching this video
I was hurt to hear that Jeffree wants to quit YT. I’m on this platform everyday. I don’t watch tv nor Netflix. I have so much fun watching my YT channels. I love watching his content when he posts. I hope he doesn’t quit permanently.
"I just got chills, but I also cringed" yep, shane. that's TikTok
Loved the episode!❤️  I  really wish you'd drop all the episodes like Netflix. I could justify calling in sick just to binge watch this series then.  🤣
It's hard for me to hear "no one clicks YouTube" while I'm sitting here after deleting all my social media BUT YouTube....🦕
Not gonna lie, as soon as Shane and Jeffree reunited I started to cry. A wave of emotions came over me and i remembered the old YouTube. How I miss the old content and Jenna too. So once Jeffree said he was quitting YouTube like Jenna it truly hit me. I miss the old days 😢
YouTube doesn’t suck :(
OK 1st off let me say I will always respect anyone's choice to do what they want to be happy.. That being said Jeffrey we're watching trust me you just stop making videos. I literally only watch YouTube and tiktok anymore it's my go to. But I respect what you want to do we will miss you and thank you for all the years that you let us into your life.😥🥰
I love shane, i love everyone in his videos but it seems more for attention now :( I don’t think i can watch the rest of the series, i just get bad vibes from Jeffree & people he’s constantly with.
Wait 😢 jeffree what? No more videos on YouTube I’m truly heartbroken 💔
Here I am every day coming home and still laying in bed and watching YouTube 🥺🥺
Ok. What?!?! Jeffree nooooo!!!
Hey Shane, I know you will probably not see my comment but, I'm hoping it makes it to you. I know I may be one voice but I'm sure others agree. Despite all of the canceling drama and lies spread about you. I have been supporting you every step of the way. I have watched you since I was young and remember the videos from your channel's very beginning. I see where Jeffery is coming from about youtube sucking, and you taking a break made me scared you were quitting. You have put a smile on my face in many dark times, and I wanted you to know that even though it may feel purposeless, Creating is always a good thing. I am a writer, and I love poetry. When you have that particular tug to create you know it's for you. And I see that same passion in each and every video you post. I was here for the food videos, ex-girlfriend, Ghost hunting, conspiracies, coming out, Ryland, and even the Shanaynay videos lol. I have seen you go through so many dark and bumpy patches in your career from the sidelines. And you are so damn inspiring. I just wanted you to know that you are so loved and cherished here on youtube, despite the negativity, there are millions of people who know the real Shane. Those who have become virtual friends through a screen, and lots of those who are praying and celebrating all of your successes.
"As long as y'all dont use they/them y'all should be fine" LMFAOOOOO
What’s the last song playing called??
I love this life update. I watch you tube all the time still. Will be sad to have him gone but I understand why he wouldn’t put anymore energy into it. Please you and ryland and Lizzy don’t quit too
i still come to youtube every single day and am still finding new youtubers every single week.
Instead of quitting I wish he would just pivot
We all grow and change, some grow apart some grow together, just be true to your own happiness and your loved ones and continue doing what feels right for you. We still watch, some not as rabidly as we once did, but we still look forward to the escapes of seeing life outside of our own four walls. Enjoy yourselves, and a lot of us are still serious, we would love to get our hands on the second palette from that collaboration and what we have seen is gorgeous!
I still watch YouTube 👋🏻👋🏻
Heart is sinking knowing jeffree is quitting youtube . My heart kinda got this weird feeling. I hope this doesnt mean hes done making palettes as well. Waiting for #cancelledpallete
RELATIVELY SPEAKING youtube videos aren't getting the clicks they used to, but us core fans are still here and YT is still my #1 video/entertainment/whatever you want to call it, and i still want more videos from ALL OF YOU GUYS, ESP. J*STAR!  who cares about views, i miss his first videos that were so simple and just playing with make up and simple holiday collections where he tried everything on with a friend, etc.....
I would be devastated if shane left youtube 😢
I’ve never been so excited for a vid
I'll buy the Shane 2 pallette just for that sparkly black shade
I watch Jeffree Star on YouTube! That's so sad. I watch YouTube every night. That's my relaxing time.
JEFREE I WATCH EVERY SINGLE VIDEO YOU POST!!! I’d rather watch YouTube then TikTok
One of the great things about Jeffree star is that he always goes all out for his friends.
Honestly Jeffree looks amazing! So healthy and happy!!
The heartbreak in your eyes Shane, when Jeff said “nobody cares anymore” & that YouTube is pretty much dead now.. I felt that, YouTube is pretty much what your career has been based on. I hope you’re okay… there is still people here who love this app & still tune in to watch. 😕
Shane is good for a title change okay 😂
I click for enjoyment. You’ll be missed. But I’m happy you’re happy
Well 371,000 views in 5 hours I'd say people are clicking lol
Kids may be leaving YouTube but I would be really upset if Shane and Ryland quit. We love you, Shane and Ryland!!!
I’m so loving this Jeffre
Wow I’m so proud of you Jeffrey. I can feel the change is real. You’ve become so grounded and real.
I can't afford those extra subscriptions.. all I do is watch YouTube cause I don't have cabel
That is so true Jeffree would hit between 15-50 million views now it’s 1.5 mil or less
I love the new Jeffery and I loved watching  his vlogs I only stopped watching when all it was was reveals for his pallets I actually looked forward to his constant I'm so very proud of him for not giving a f anymore and doing what makes him happy and you can see in his Radiance.
my best friend hasn't watched this yet... she's gonna SOB at the end we've been watching jeffree for EVER and his videos are fully part of our friendship 😢
I get what he is saying about the younger generation moving away from YouTube but I would be so sad to see the long form content go away all together.  I hate YouTube shorts 🙁
I don't want a YouTube without jeffery 😭😭
He looks so healthy and free ❤
Jeffree is honestly so funny, his quick one liners never flop.
I still love YouTube 🤍
Can Shane and Jeffree videos be a regular thing !? 😍 love this energy !
stop because jeffree is actually so fucken funny 😭😂
DROP THE PALETTE !
I honestly agree with Jeffree about his content. Not just his - beauty industry YouTube videos just aren’t my thing anymore. I kind of drifted to TikTok when so many creators got cancelled and stopped getting on YouTube weekly to watch them, because they stopped making content.   Shane’s content is different. It’s like tuning into a Netflix series. But beauty content? Yeah I can’t remember the last time I sat down to watch a tutorial or a review.   I can honestly say I used to watch all of Jeffree’s content and I really liked it! YouTube is just… phasing out for beauty influencers.
Guys please don't stop YouTube 😭 You're my only reason for this app. Everytime I see one of you upload I get so excited. TikTok just isn't the same as YouTube.
Why is JS so good looking love his eyebrows and skin is flawless such a handsome man
I meet Jeffrey many many years ago inside a Hottopic at the Block of Orange (now know as the outlets at orange) when he was MySpace famous & everyone around Orange county, CA knew who he was. He was not yet rich at that point but I took of picture with him and I still have the picture. Jeffrey has changed and I'm happy he has found peace, finally 😌
I thought you guys were gunna send out the pallet I want it
I still watch youtube alot i love just playing vids in the background
I hope success finds each of you in every endeavor. I am a makeup artist because of Jeffree and his introduction of lipstick nic. I feel like my family is back together. You might have been “canceled” but in my heart you were always praised
Love this side of JS it’s such vibe
I love Shane and Ryland   That being said    I’m sick of Chris’s retarded laughter
I disagree with Jeffrey at the end there. I’m a YT fanatic I love it so much been on it for years. The only media I have on my phone
I laughed so much during this video. THANK YOU
The very end conversation actually made me tear up, wow.
I still watch YouTube
I miss YouTube Jeffree!! I hate tictok!! I don't have it and don't plan to get it. The only updates I get now are snapchat
This was amazing…will be tuning in for part 2
I’m still here Jeffree and Shane! I’m still clicking. I love YouTube and I always will.
It's so good to see you and Jeffree back together again after all the drama and craziness of the past few years. I am laughing, I'm crying, I'm everything all at once! Love you guys so much
im eating this shit uppppppp
I HAVE MISSED YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!!!!!!
Shane Editing is next level 🔥
"No one watches YouTube for enjoyment anymore" Me, shrinking away with my old ass self, who loves YT videos still because I am too old for TikTok LOL
👀 no, pues wow… Im shocked. Cant wait for the next video 👏👏👏
I feel like all the good YouTubers grew up and are moving in with there lives. It’s only a matter of time before Shane quits. It’s very sad to see.
SHANE THE AUDIO I N THIS VIDEO IS ATROCIOUS WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jeffery has a point about the youtube thing tho.. i've wanted to be a youtuber since elementary school! I started uploading in middle school. started being more consistent in high school and hit 100 subs in 2019 and then now im almost 21 and i feel like i'm never going to make it as a youtuber. i am very proud of how far i have come but i don't think i'll ever be able to make it my full-time job.
Jeffrey, I love you and always watch your YT’s. I learned how to do makeup and learn about all your products from YT. I watch all of Shane, Ryland’s & Morgan’s YT’s also. We still watch them but you gotta do what feeds your soul ❤️
Some how Shane always posts when I’m having a hard time in my life and he always makes it better ❤️
i love their friendship so much
Absolutely heart breaking end. I go to youtube every day and more and more of my favorites keep leaving. To say "no one" watches anymore is just gutting for those of us who still do.
Nooooo jeffree please 🥺❤️
I can honestly say I missed you all together so much. This revived a part of my soul that I didn’t know was dead!! Thank you Shane for this series ❤
I am beyond sad that Jeffrey is not going to make any more YouTube videos. There is only a couple YouTubers that I religiously watch no matter when they put a video out maybe I can't get to it as soon as it comes out but I watch them the reason I don't watch most of them as soon as they come out it's because I want to be present for the whole video and not have background noise or the kids needing me to disrupt a video because I just love watching them so much so I really hope Shane I hope you never leave
You can really tell who are God's people in LA they all left lol
I feel like there is a huge difference between "no one" and "less". just because you are getting less views, does not mean that no one appreciates your content. ultimately, I feel like it depends on whether you are happy creating the content <3
I don’t see growth from Jeffry I see arrogance dressed up in yak cowboy boots next to Jeffry I really see how much Shane has grown and I would not be shocked if this is the last we see Shane and Jeffry together
Personally I love YouTube and not a big fan of tik tok!
Why would Jeffree quit Youtube i ithink it’s a big mistake i only watch YouTube not fkn tik tok
*Everyone running to Jeffree’s channel after the last 2 min* 🤯🏃🏼‍♀️💨🫣
I care abt both of your yts😕😞
I still wat h YouTube and prefer it over Netflix or anything even TikTok
Um make up reviews will never be done or I'm not buying make up til your review
I still watch YouTube for fun as my main TV 😢and we are all watching this! Haha. But I’m genuinely so glad Jeffree has found peace and doing what he needs!
I think it was so disrespectful of Jeffry to say YouTube sucks and no one’s watching anymore when that’s Shane’s career and that’s his platform just because it’s not working for Jeffry and he said he’s done it all doesn’t mean people are not watching has he lost his mind Shane I hope you don’t take that to heart
I seriously love this new jeffree. It’s funny becuase it’s like he was reprising this amazing side of himself and now he’s able to just be himself and I’m living for it.
This is AMAZING SHANE! who else to do an amazing series with? Gotta have Jeffree🖤 so f*cking proud of you all! Love this please don't ever stop! You are so talented. F*ck the haters you keep slaying boo!🖤
You can tell how much happier Jeffree is!! ❤️😭
OMG your truly done Jeffree?????? I fricken watch you faithfully!!!!!
Wait stop I got to the end where Jeffree talked about retiring YouTube and I’m crying … /:
The cameraman talks too much. Kills the vibe.
So what does this actually mean? He’s quitting YouTube ok, but does that mean that he is no longer going to be in the makeup biz? Does this mean he is not going to continue his brands? What?
So what does this actually mean? He’s quitting YouTube ok, but does that mean that he is no longer going to be in the makeup biz? Does this mean he is not going to continue his brands? What?
YouTube is not dead. We definitely are still here tuning in.
Ryland should’ve kept the travel outfit on. Love Jeffrees new home
I still watch. However I get it.  Fm 3-20million views to 500k. I get it.  And there are so many channels, the Market is flooded.
Literally me home after a hard day going excited on YouTube and enjoying the videos from my fav creators just like 10 years ago 💔
I feel like people still care about YouTube just not the beauty community and not tens of millions. There’s been a shift for sure but I still love watching podcasts on YouTube.
Only the real ones are still here 😅✌🏼✨🥰
very cool vid, i still love youtube, i have nothing else.
Seeing Jeffree and Shane together melted my heart. The two of them were the only reason I logged onto YouTube sometimes. Just means I need to give that other site ;) some more of my time. Maybe Jeffree can teach me how to love the other site.
I think as viewers we have to step up the likes and views all we can to let these creators know how much we actually appreciate and count on being able to enjoy their content
I have missed this so much
Shane this is amazing! Love that you’re creating again 💓 sending love to you and Ryland!
Oop. There it was.
“Portal to Hell” make-up palette 🎨 😮❤lol now that sounds great 👍
I'm actually kinda sad Jeffree ks quitting YouTube. Although I agree that it's fizzling out, it will come back around when people get sick of the 30 second makeup reveals. If I'm going to buy something, I personally like to watch everything about the product. There has been numerous "TikTok" makeup items that are claimed to be holy grails in 30 seconds and they've turned out to be SHIT because you didn't get to see an in depth review of that item. Its a bummer.
I’m so sad. YouTube is not dead. I have never stopped watching since 2011. It is my main form of entertainment and I don’t want everyone to leave 😢
I watch all of y’all & it’s the best part of my shitty life pls don’t stop…
I have to admit....seeing this more humble, carefree Jeffrey really warms my ❤. I love this new change. Money, status, fame are worthless if you're not at peace. He seems to have found it and  I love to see it. 🗻
Jeffree is one of my most favorite humans ever. Shane too.
No private jet this time ?
I laughed so hard. Thank you for this!
No, cus now I need a Jeffree and Shane paranormal series!
Be a JENNA and hang up your button Shane!
I see ieffrees side in quiting but I love my fav YouTubers and will faithfully watch
Did he change the name of the video ???
I still care about youtube!!!!!! Lol
Wow…. All I have to say is I’m still here! I don’t have tik tok, Netflix, D plus ect… love you guys
the ending literally just made me so sad.  i love you guys.
Jeffree saying “no one cares about YouTube” while we’re all sitting here like 👁👄👁
Everything has to come to an end some time 😭😭😭 I just never thought the day would come 🥺
Wow cant wait to see more❤
But like I care about jeff on YouTube I always click as fast as I can just like your videos.
I love Jeffree & Shane both so much!!!! Please never quit 🙏🙏🙏😭
I have missed you guys so much! New pants, new  jacket,  new life.... rylan same shirt 😂 iconic
Retiring off of Youtube is very bittersweet. As fans/viewers we want you guys to be happy and live fulfilled lives but it's very hard to say 'goodbye' and 'see you later' - you're also a part of our lives and your content is something we look forward to.
I'm so happy Jeffree has found some peace and is honestly happy.  It is so good seeing you guys together again, I love your friendship
Excuse me but I am that one person still watching YouTube lol I can't afford any of the services like Netflix etc I am on Tiktok a little but only for a certain group of people. I need yall 😩 🤣
omg this was epic!!!!!!! im so sad its over 😢
its very weird to see "celebrities" or online personalities are RAVING about something i've been used to my entire life and want to get the hell away from - the country. I live in the south and I don't get it. Tons of farmland with nothing nearby is just not something i'd enjoy, i'd get like, lonely and more depressed probably lol. Then you see these people who have everything they could ever want - now wanting to live in the middle of nowhere. Weird parasocial circle goin' on here.
Jeffree star is my favorite person on this planet
Plzz Shane you and Jeffrey need to come out with that second pallet I'll buy it
YouTube is the only thing I watch ever. Except Wednesday’s I also watch the Chucky series
Twitter is adding long videos and paying content creators. Great opportunity
I literally watch youtube all the time. I love the channels I'm subscribed to and it's all I watch. I don't even watch shows on subscription services. There's so many amazing people on youtube that have such unique content and there's such a variety. It's very much still important and fun for people
Personally Jeffery’s yak life is my dream life !!! I could care less about mansions & purses but all of that beautiful nature and animals would be such a dream!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💝🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
There's ten min left and I have a feeling we aren't gonna get to know this news today
I started watching Jeff since day 1 when he started posting videos on YouTube. I’m gonna miss him
Please don’t quit YouTube Jeffree :’( your content on here is a joy and comfort to so many of us and we all grew up watching you!
I still watch JS though 😢😢😢😢
Him saying no one watches YouTube anymore is so not true I’m on YouTube till I can’t find anything else to watch then I go on TikTok
damn. i LEFT tiktok because of how horrible it is for attention-span and mental health. i love youtube and am on it literally everyday. i totally disagree, i think a ton of people are still on youtube and i think it will outlive tiktok.
You guys have to understand where Jeffree's coming from. Him and Shane are different people when it comes to creating and Youtube just isn't where his joy comes from anymore; whereas Shane is extremely passionate about editing and video creation process. I get why you'd be upset but people grow and change!  I get lots of judgement for enjoying you guys' content because of all the cancellations but I believe that people grow and change (it was over a decade ago. times were truly different and the humor was different.) They were held accountable and they BOTH have apologized so that is why I will continue to watch their content no matter what platform!  Jeffree, I'm coming to your TikTok baby!!❣
I was definitely not ready to say goodbye to Jeffree, his videos have been a very huge part of my life and just to know that it will stop forever, makes my heart break.... however I really wish him all the happiness in this life. He deserves it.
you are my literal childhood, i temper when i was 8 and watching you and my mom was like “turn that inappropriate video off” but i wouldn’t i would just secretly watch you until i grew up, forget my comfort youtuber, i love you guys ❤️
Ok, I just have to say Jeffree quitting YouTube is bullshit. I luv YouTube and I'm not going to stop watching beauty tutorials (they are my favorite). The kids and TikToc, give me a fucking break.
I missed these videos so much. You guys are amazing and deserve the world. These videos are something I look forward to. Y’all are iconic as fuck and I cherish my Conspiracy pallet and wish it was all love and rainbows that it was initially and not the cancellation that it was. F them! They are only jealous of your success and drive. You were so happy in those videos and I’m glad we are getting that Shane back. You rock and don’t forget it!
I watch YouTube everyday it’s one of the first apps I open 😅
i wish shane could do a series with jenna marbles and talking about what led up to her decision and what she is doing now
If Jeffree needs to move on, I get it. But I look forward to this series and Shane’s and Rylands podcasts. I would be sad if everyone just up and left us. I’m here as long as they are.
Jeffrey you mater to me 💯💞❤️
I remember watching Shane for the first time being upset about mean people and his humor made me forget about them all and made my day. Shane is so funny. I love you Shane!!
❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕
i absolutely love coming to youtube for enjoyment purposes. tv shows are great but my “watching tv” is watching youtube
I truly hope Jeffree doesn't quit YouTube but if that makes him happy I'm for that 💯 I'll be a forever fan regardless!! We Need That Pallet like PRONTO 🤣🥰🥰
I moved from California to Idaho a year and a half ago and I’m so much more carefree than I used to be too. Change can be good for the soul❤
im proud of jeffree he needs to keep doing what hes doing and be happy! new beginings always start with a sad ending!
I think makeup content is dead on YouTube but a lot of other communities are thriving on YouTube. I still clock more hours on YouTube than any other platform or streaming service.
Honest time..I have been watching your videos ever since you first started posting up videos on here. When your makeup collection came out, I bought the whole thing and experimented and because of that I found a love for makeup and went to a career in it ❤️ thank you for being a huge inspiration for me. It would also be funny if you called the 2nd pallette 'cancelled'
I’m so confused lol.
not me sitting here watching youtube for entertainment as Jeffery says nobody is on youtube anymore 🤪
I love YouTube 🥺 But also compared to the other businesses Jeffree has he obviously doesn’t need YouTube and I know it’s a ton of work for little payoff. I feel like beauty isn’t poppin right now 🤷🏻‍♀️ I see some of these vlogger girls making GOOOD money. Not everyone needs $200 mil a year.
Listen, it wasn't your fault Jeffree got canceled and Morphe ended their relationship with Jeffree.. he had all his own scandals going on. I'm glad you two were reunited though, and so happy that Jeffree is happy and healthier now. But, do NOT ever blame yourself.
this has to be one of my favorite Shane/Jeffree videos just for the simple fact of how happy they both are out of LA! jeffree is like a completely different person & I think him moving to Wyoming was the best thing he’s ever done! Shane seems in a much better head space being in colorado and I’m so excited for him & Ryland to have their baby!
So happy to hear he's doing fine but me and Shane had the same reaction, heart breaking.
What's the last song of this video called and who is it by?
You called it the retirement of jeffree !! I’m NOT CRAZY
I watch YouTube daily for enjoyment. As far as Jeffree, I enjoy watching his  vlogs, makeup reviews, everything else EXCEPT when ALL he started showing was his product reviews. That being said, if he’s no longer in to it, that is what likely is translating to his YouTube viewers. There’s no way people don’t pick up on it. One shouldn’t sacrifice their happiness for others sake. Jeffree has maaaannny other endeavors if he doesn’t enjoy YouTube any longer he shouldn’t do it.
I love YouTube 🥲
This made me so happy seeing you guys back together in a video!
RIP DIAMOND 💎 loss and death can really change a person and out life into a new perspective.
youtube is def not dead girl
❤❤❤❤ the reunion!!!
The title changed? It used to say the retirement of jefree. I guess because that was a lie so he changed it
“ no one watches blablablah” meanwhile, he has millions of views every video 🙄
I love you so much, Shane ❤ so proud of you. 🎉
😢 I miss jeffree on YouTube !!!
Loved this!! ❤️
Love this series can't wait for the next video
Although YouTube has changed and is changing, some people still watch. I still watch. I really enjoy your content, and I would watch it if it were on YouTube or wherever. Don’t stop pls 😅
Oufff the ending got really deep but I can say as an almost 30 year old woman ! I only watch YouTube when I need to decompress! All my old faves are still here 10 years later and It’s the best part of my day
I'll miss Jeffree on YouTube, but I want him to only be happy. But Shane, don't you quit. I love your docuseries and podcast...
In my opinion , I still love YouTube but I think the beauty space isn't as watched anymore. I used to watch beauty videos all day but i no longer watch any of that. I'd rather watch other stuff. But I hate tik tok Lol
💔💔💔
Yayy❤🎉🎉soooo excited for this!!!! I LOVE YOU SHANE,RYLAND JEFFERY & FAMILY +EVERYONE ELSE YALL ARE AMAZINGGG❤🥰🥰😘😘😍😍💙💙💙
💔💔💔💔😭 you made me cry at the end 😭
Jeffree seems so happy, he radiates it tho, made me smile
I love Jeffrey and I'm glad he is happy but making a declaring statement that no one is watching YouTube and that it sucks is not right. I get it if he wants to quit but he shouldn't deter others from the app. People are deff still watching especially millennials and gen x. Keep making content we love you guys!💕
There are lots of us here, Shane! Still a faithful viewer!
Nooooo Jeffree 😢 ❤
I RECENTLY GOT A YOUTUBE SUBSCRIPTION I PROMISE PEOOE STILL CARE!!!!!!
Also I’m jefrees age and he inspired me to do the lip injections etc it’s really full circle that I’m letting those bitches dissolve and being my natural late 30 year old self and we’ll jefree is being his but lord is he still so fabulous
so so so WRONG about people not watching! It's more so that the content being put out is not engaging anymore. Shane's videos I LEAP at because he is a wonderful story teller. There is absolutely still a place for YT but the landscape is just different to what it used to be. But I am so happy to see Jeffery having a blast in his little piece of paradise and moving on from the drama. Being a celeb absolutely SUCKS and YTers especially get slapped with the bullshit.
It makes me sad when I hear people say that everyone just loves TikTok and doesn’t get on YouTube anymore, because I don’t think that’s true 🥺 I don’t get TikTok and I still love watching YouTube videos. We are all here watching this one because we enjoy these type of videos I hope you never quit YouTube Shane ❤️
Jeffree is right. YT is dead. HOWEVER, it's dead for makeup creaters. It's DEF not dead for other departments. I THINK it's time for your a** to do some intensive research of scary locations around the US or International to take ur conspiracy theories/haunting locations to the next SHANELEVEL!
Holy shit the ending made me cry
I LOVE YOU
jajajaj, que las puertas se abran de la forma correcta! me mato, muy jeffrey! un groso, lo banco!
I love watching Shane, Ryland Blogs & Morgan’s house updates blogs 💖💖💖 Jeffree should do Jeffree Blogs😍😍😍😍 or star yak ranch blogs🥰
Please do the haunted Wyoming series PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!
Beg to differ!  I stay on YT way more than I care to admit, and I click on EVERY Jeffree video that is posted.
Not the Jenna Marbles reference 😭
So proud of you Shane!! Loving this new series. Your friendship with Jeffree seems so effortless and you two together always have me dying of laughter😝 Your hard work is definitely paying off!!💜💜
Jeffree still trying to pretend like he’s never had alcohol in his life😂
Noooooo please don't let Jeffree quit!!!! You two are the whole reason I started & continue to watch YouTube!!!!!! 😢💔
The alfalfa sprout out of the back of jefrees hat is super relatable
As someone who lives in Casper I find it hilarious they flew from Denver to Casper
Even after every house tour, closet tour, new cars, I have never been more jealous of Jeffree Star’s life. His peace is covetable 💕
I love Jeffrey Star and he looks so happy 😊  I will miss his videos
Hearing Jeffree say “no one cares about YouTube anymore” kinda broke my heart a little, for years YouTube is the app Ive consumed the most, above TikTok above anything and it still is, while I’m sad that he is quitting, I’m happy if it helps bring the final strand of peace Jeffree deserves
He has millions of views...
I lo e jeffrees got an electric hummer 🍃❤️❤️
I really don’t want Jeffrey to leave utube I love his videos and yours keep it so enjoying this series keep it up
PLEASE PLEASE do a ghost hunting or paranormal series with Jeffree omg yes!!!
I still go to YouTube all the time. It gives me more entertainment. But …if jeffree stops then how will we like… get updates on products 😢
This series is my new obsession also please don't let Jeffree quit 😢 I him & you so much
I CARE ABOUT YOUTUBE!! This is amazing - loving it so far. Don't ever quit on us!!
I love YouTube. I still come to watch ❤
Did I not see an original title early today for this called "The Retirement of Jeffree Star"?
Shane & Jeffree were the only people I could turn to for happiness after my dad died. Hearing that Jeffree is leaving Youtube made my stomach turn. Ive watched every video since the beginning. Even though im torn the hell up by this news, Im glad that he has found his peace and found a place that he loves.
You make me so happy I’m so happy that you’re bringing the videos back I’ve been depressed his past couple weeks and like I have a smile on my face and I haven’t thought about suicide in over two weeks thank you Shane
i still love youtube just as much as i did 10 years but i have to agree.. youtube is dying out :(
So GOOD!!!! I'm hooked 🙌
I Love you and Jeffrey so much!! Has anyone ever noticed that Jeffrey and Justin Bieber could pass as brothers? Love you so much Jeffrey and Shane and Wayland 💯💞❤️💞
Can… I have a pair of Gucci shoes for my ankles? 🥹
Chris b hurting my head with how much he touches the microphone
Loving that the drive from Denver to Casper is like 4 hours but our kings took a flight 👑
Been waiting for this video ❤ I fckin love these collabs
😢I love Jeffree. I hate to think the last launch is it for his YouTube.
Okay stop I hear Jeffree say haunted and a fucking light build went off, Shane plssss film that. Or is that lame? /:
*me on the couch watching youtube* 🫣
Okay but why does Jeffree look so much more attractive. Literally glowing!
Omg no way... jeffee quitting YouTube I still watch all his videos I'm just so shocked I'll miss him loads and Shane you keep up the brilliant work your doing as I love you all you are all amazing 😭😊
not the fact that every time i see somthing say jeffery i think of jeffrey dhamer
Okay 600 acres sounds more like Jeffree. lol making some more sense.
Okay 600 acres sounds more like Jeffree. lol making some more sense.
Youtube really helped me when i was going through bad times when i was younger. I know its not anyones job to make me happy or less depressed. But thats why i started watching shanes videos.   I dont think people dont care about youtube. But i do understand that people dont want to have to record videos for the rest of their life.
I would die if I ever had 1 berkin
The gun LMAO
I still love watching you tube 😢
Jeffree now… plenty of people are getting clicks, you’re just not getting what you used to bc you d!ed off , YouTube isn’t de@d…your channel is. Don’t be petty 🤦🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️🙄
Love this 🥰🥰 also love how the nostalgia of the first series brings back the nostalgia of how life was then and pre covid
Jeffery is a whole mood
We moved out to Wyoming and we literally fell in love with this state 💙
I’ll admit I do not watch YouTube anymore. I still watch Shane’s videos and I always will but I don’t watch anyone else. I use to watch other YouTubers but I just don’t care anymore tbh. I just watch tik tok now.
Weird hearing that whole “youtube isn’t anything anymore”. Its the main thing i watch so it doesn’t feel real. Like i dont have time to sit and pay full attention to a tv show on netflix but I’ll watch youtube all day
I absolutely love you guys and YouTube!
jeffery reminds me of willy wonka but like a pretty version
Okay but why did Jeffree and Shane reuniting make me cry? Love you both! WERK!
I like this jeffree
Ketamine Jeffree is the coolest dude, chill AF.
Okay well watching this before bed gave me chills. Didn't need this news break 😮‍💨🥺 Going to bed completely lost 😟😔
I hate to say this but the only real difference now is the cameraman! And I still care and freaking love YouTube Jeffree!
I love this series already. It makes me so happy to see the changes in them it's amazing to see
Omg please release the palette and call it “cancelled”
I'm a little concerned that jeffree had a silencer on his gun. 🤔
Youtube dies when i die tyvm
Idk, maybe it’s because I’m an elder millennial, who grew up watching Shane Dawson, but I still turn to YouTube to get my Shane Dawson and Ryland content. ❤ Love you guys
I really am speechless at the end of this. I felt so much. I felt joy seeing you all together again enjoying eachother's company. You all have been surrounded by ingenuity for so long but you all always felt so organic. I felt peace seeing Jeffree stepping away from the spotlight and focusing on the world around him. I got an adrenaline rush seeing all the old clips! I remember hanging on a thread for the episodes to release and being queued for an hour at work but LOSING MY MIND when I got a palette on the initial launch, which I still treasure today. It broke my heart to think Jeffree thinks YouTube is lost to him. I watch YouTube now more than ever, and he was a huge part of what drew me to it. I miss the good old days when you did conspiracy videos and he did makeup reviews. That's all I could want again, I think it's what alot of people want. I still come home and decompress to YouTube. I get on Tik Tok for an hour maybe once a month and am over it. Thanks for this series though. It's been great to watch so far, happy to see everyone's growth! There's still such a large community who loves you both.
I care! I will definitely miss Jeffree omg!
There better not be the day of “the last time we logged out of YouTube” just like with MSN. That’d be a sad day. I feel like the OG’s of the world are still for sure watching YouTube. I love a good lunch with a video on, sushi and YouTube is where it’s at. But the younger generation is fading out.
Honestly im so happy for then both especially Jeffree he seems more free in this one so himself unapologetically
I wear the flaming hot shade everyday 🔥
I literally grew up with Jeffree. MySpace YouTube music makeup….I’m at peace with his choice to stop YouTube. I’m going to miss him and try and keep up where I can like snap and tiktok
jeffree leaving youtube… he’s the father of this place. i don’t want to watch the 3 min tik tok videos i love the 20 minute in-depth videos. 😦🥺 brb gonna go cry
My heart broke and I definitely cried my eyes out at the end, but Jeffree being happy is what I want to see, and if that’s not on YouTube, then so be it 🤍🥹
Don't you dare stop YouTube!
If you don’t post the next video right now I will cry. This series is sooooo good!!
Me over here watching YouTube like TV still.. 😂 *but* I totally get it.  Happy for Jeffree and will always be eternally grateful to him for showing me how fun makeup can be!
It is sad to see Jeffree quitting YouTube, i hope he keeps doing tiktoks/shorts those get views easily and are fun :)
Jeffree: No cares anymore about YouTube Me: only watching YouTube and hating on tik tok
LOL Jeffree saying "we're going green now". Loving this series, love seeing you all together again
I wish I knew Shane was here bro. In Casper?! IN MY TOWN BRO! Like SHANE?! Anyway I’m not salty about it 😂 I’m offended jeffree said we had no gay culture. We do… kinda   Also weeds illegal here but I’m hella stoned rn too so jeffree, can I get a g of wax? OMG I WANT JEFFREE AS MY WEED DEALER
Did you do this series as a farewell to Jeffree ? Bc if so I’ll go stock up on Kleenex.
shane tell jeffeee that I still watch his videos .. and I happen to enjoy them all the time.. I go back and rewatch them. He needs to get it together *in tears*
I don't care if you like or dislike Jeffree, he's one hell of a business man.  From a musician that built a career on Myspace (before myspace was Just music) to a dream about makeup, finding someone that believed in him and put up the capital, to a makeup mogel now to a farmer. A multi millionaire with his hands in everything.  Makes me wish I was more driven
I'm saddened by the fact that Jeffree is quitting YouTube 💔 I've always watched all his videos so it sucks that us viewers get punished for it.
I had to do pasword reset on my YouTube account because I don't use it anymore!!
Jeffeees beautiful ranch house then you go down these mysterious stairs to the "STAR CAVE" 🌟🤩 I LOVE IT!!
I am crying.  This is hard for me as someone who's watched every moment. It feels like the end of an era in my lifetime. It hurts my heart. I will forever be one to watch things you guys put out. You feel like friends to me in a way, you've been such a huge part of my life. Thank you for all you shared, both/all of you. Looking forward to the next episode
jeffree’s revelation about youtube is true tho like it’s fizzling out and i just wonder if there’s gonna be a new place longer format will be able to live in the future
i love Jeffree soo much and I love so much seeing him happy. I do hate that he feels like quitting youtube as thats the only way i see him, but if its what he feels is right than ill find another way to support him <3
YouTube is literally the only thing I watch.
We ARE still  watching!!
Wyoming is also a major tax haven - but yes there is no one there
Jeffree, we just want you to be happy doll!
Please don' quit YouTube  too. Knowledge watches makeup true. But you we will watch.
Oommggg , I Lovedd This .
I watch everything Jeffee puts out. It’ll be sad not to see him. The end of an era
He should definitely go ghost hunting with jeffree. I think their energy would make it funny
OMG MY BOSS HAS THE SAME HUMMER. ITS SO BAD ASS!
But if Jeffree quits YouTube who will Peter Monn have to make unnecessary and hallow videos about?!? Don’t ruin that old queen’s livelihood!!! 😢
Can anyone in the comments tell me why the conspiracy palette isn’t on Jeffree’s website anymore
Alright.. idk what tf Jeffree is talking about .. no one goes on YouTube anymore? Jeffree Star is the only YouTuber I have the notification bell on..I've never missed a single one of his videos and always loving what he puts out...if he's comparing his views to someone like mrbeast..please stop 💀
I still love YouTube please don’t leave me all alone Shane and Ryland please!!! Ps such a great series Shane!
Ugh can’t wait for part 3! Always loved y’all together
But I still see it.
I like to travel but not with Elton John. (Insert ryland) lmao
I’m loving seeing the new Jeffree, y’all should do another pallet and call it canceled.
literally cried when jeffree said he was quitting youtube! I LOV him, I love youtube... TikTok is the one that sucks :( cant wait for part 3 to hear more about this!
Pleeeeaassee launch the Shane Dawson 2!! I want it lol 😍💜
Not me have a smile on my face the entire time! Omg, seeing y’all back together FINALLY makes me so happy and ready to hear all the new tea 🤪 ❤❤❤❤
Just thought I'd let you know I'm sitting here watching YouTube for enjoyment 🤣🤣
GHOST SERIES WITH JEFFREE!!! Please ?!
I caught the pallet name slip 😊 I guessed it already, though. Love seeing all of you live you true best lives 💜
SHANE I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE MAKING JOKES ABOUT OUR BODIES.
I still watch YouTube on a daily basis. Just hearing Jeffree say that he’s quitting it makes me sad. Jeffree Star and another beauty influencer helped me love make-up and showed me how to express myself through it. I just hope he doesn’t delete his channel so his videos stay up, and we can continue to watch them.
I guess I live under a rock......I didn't know he had a YouTube channel 🤣🤣
Have to say I definitely click on the reviews love those Jeffree
Youtube may “suck” but I love it still😢❤
But…I still watch YouTube 😔 it’s pretty much the only thing I watch
I am so happy for you both. As someone who has been around since myspace/ early youtube for you both I am thrilled with how happy you both are and Jeffrey thank you for all the years of content. I am here for what the future could be!
jeffree just seems so incredibly happy. and that makes me happy.
I mean I love YouTube but I watch gaming videos, commentary.. it is true that it's super dead for the beauty community tho
i neeed ghost hunting with Jeffree, thank you
I LOVE THE NEW JEFFREEEE
I'm loving the series so far! I'm sad to think Jeffree leaving YouTube. Watching your raw friendship on screen is way more entertaining than Netflix, Hulu, ect. Keep living your best life!
made me get that lump in my throat when he said no one is watching youtube anymore.. I have been a daily watcher for 10+ years. It hit me personally and sounds so silly to say but it hurt me deeply. its a big part of my day and I really want you and anyone else who thinks just because the numbers aren't as large as they were that the people who are still watching are actually here and want to be here. I hope that's not the mindset of my favorite creators because I almost don't know who I would be without this platform. it has shaped my interests and how I view people in a really positive light regardless of cancellations and all that dumb fleeting bullshit. im all for just watching people I love be creative and share anything they want. I can really appreciate the amount of blood sweat and tears that go into each video anyone posts. so from the bottom of my heart thank you for posting <3
I Watch YouTube everyday!! ❤
Jeffree.  Nooooo!!!!!!!!!!!  I love you. I totally understand. I will so miss you. Good for you for going out on a high note. That is class to the highest degree.
I will cry if you quit you tube Shane!
YouTube is still my favorite platform
Jeffree is so sexy - tell him to hmu if he needs a 50+ rheumatic live-in pinball machine cleaner.
I still love YouTube!
Jeffree is the definition of you can be and do whatever you want in life. He lives in his own art!
who is the girl with jeffree?
Jeffree NO DON'T STOP YOUTUBE I know I am not anyone that matters but I will miss you See Them A-Holes and That stupid Cancel Culture Yak Shizz Ruined it for so many people with cancelling and I think everyone was changed with Shane and I think They know They screwed up lol I don't know who they are But lol ..... Gosh Darn it I love You Jeffree Please come back from time to time Just don't stop all the way Please I just can't with Tik Tok
This was so refreshing. I just love y’all!
YouTube is alive for me as long as I watch every single one of your and Ryland's video. just fucking love this series so much, I am so glad that you're back here.
Ok I’m gonna keep watching forever regardless because the videos are good and I love Shane, but eventually he’s gonna have to come up with a plot that isn’t just “we are filming and I didn’t think this would turn into something but omg now all this stuff is happening” lol
No Jeffree we watch you!!!!!
Jeffree: *filming video with Shane for Shane’s channel*   Also Jeffree: nobody gives a fuck about YouTube anymore. YouTube sucks. Literally no one is clicking anymore.
I literally cried when ya’ll hugged 🥺😭💜
Shane, I grew up watching your videos and together the series that you did with Jeffree really helped me getting through my hard time, I ju st wanna say thank you :)
*JEFFREE* if you happen to see this, we loved your content for a long time when you would review strange make up, do a look with 4-5 new products; not to mention jumping on those trends like 'I followed a so-and-so tutorial'.  We hated when you left YouTube and only came back to sell/promote something. 😐
EXCUSE ME JEFFREE WE LITERALLY LIVE FOR YOUTUBE
I don't know what it is but just seeing Jeffree on screen made me tear up. Of course I don't claim to know him at all but I feel like he's grown so much and he's done a lot of healing. There's something just at peace about his energy now. I'm genuinely happy for him :' )
I think it’s so mean of people to post stuff like that of Shane online. Bro is just trying to live his life and be a good person and all people wanna do is hate
What does yak taste like? My husband buys tons of ground bison. Does it taste like that?
Oof the cant say they/them got me sad but i also get the joke as a nonbinary myself lol😂
I don't want jeffree to quit YouTube :(
I’m still watching, Shane, for videos like yours. I love you and YouTube.
Nooo I love watching him on YouTube he makes me happy and you also ❤
Love the series Shane! Jeffree 😢 makes me sad that you’re leaving YT but I LOVE seeing you TRULY happy and doing the damn thing sis! You two crack me up!!
I will miss Jeffree on YouTube.
Jeffree will always be iconic, so sad to see him quit YouTube. I always look forward to living vicariously through everyone I watch on you tube at the end of every night! I hope you and ryland don’t quit, I get pure joy from watching y’all’s videos and vlogs and podcasts!
I still say you should do a series with him making music! Y’all should make a single!
I’m glad Jeffery is happy but to take it so lightly about killing his yaks is not it. 😣
I care about YouTube! ❤
I love seeing Jeffree so happy!! He definitely deserves it but I’m super bummed he’s quitting YouTube videos 😭 I look forward to getting a new notification he’s uploaded one💔
Wtf most people love YouTube!
YouTube has introduced me to sooo many new people in the UK.   I am proud of you all . As a mom, to see how much you all have grown and matured it wonderful. Thank you for allowing us to be a part of the journey.
Jeffree's ....... eyebrows? Is anyone else obsessed? Is this old news? I literally cannot stop staring at them.
Me clicking :( lol
Who needs morphe anyhow. It was there loss.
I’m so happy to see Jeffery embracing things that matter and embracing the community he lives in and contributing. As much as the glam and money is fun to watch, it’s just not good for the soul. He is finally getting it and I’m happy for him. I get why he wants to leave YouTube. However I’m not interested in tik tok and have never downloaded it and never will. He will be missed.
I love this
The more Youtube focuses on Shorts and people Mass subscribe to everyone as they scroll like they do on TikTok,  views on regular videos will shrink massively, because the subscription feed will be so Longgggg, messy and crazy. And when people are subscribed to over 2000 people how do you expect your video to be found. I kinda wish shorts never became a thing. But people definitely are still on here watching, its just the algorithm that needs to help the video be found.  :)
These 2 are literally ICONIC! Best videos ever!!!! 🥰💕
I still travel with my black Shane and Jeffree makeup bag with the piggies!
watching from Philippines 🇵🇭  I really love Jeffrey ⭐
I am a 28 year old mother of 2. The downtime I have (such as right now @ 9:53 pm on a work night - just cleaned up and organized the house for tomorrow) is spent browsing YouTube for enjoyment. Maybe I am not keeping up with the times.. I don’t have a TikTok and never enough time/energy to enjoy many series on Netflix/Hulu etc. I should add… this was one of the more exciting 3 part series I’ve anticipated to watch. Shane, please never give up on YouTube. I’m here, and so are others.
Release the pallette!! Release the pallette!! It's the only thing that can make this series right. If we are losing Jeffree on YouTube. As fans who always supported both of you through the cancelation deserve and are dying for. Lol. Release the pallette!! Release the pallette!!
Wow I hate he wants to quit YouTubing but damn he seems so much happier. We love you and Shane bud but I don’t understand what’s wrong with people. You are seriously iconic
they should release the palette and call it "canceled"
Great video Shane!!! It was so nice to see you all together again!! So many good things for all you!  I love all of you !😊🥰❤❤💘
I do watch a lot less YouTube than 2 years ago, but I still watch just about every day…
Aw I’m so glad you decided to do this!! Love you and love Jeffree!!🥹💕
Jeffree I love u so much and I really don’t want u to quit YouTube! I miss ur make up videos so much! Please don’t retire! ❤
All I watch is YouTube. 😢  I’m 37 and YouTube is still something I look forward to every night. Every time you guys upload I click as fast as I can. This breaks my heart. However you have to put YOU first! You will be truly missed on YouTube! I will make sure to keep up with updates on all your other social media. I can’t wait until the Psychedelic Circus launch, it looks so fun!! I own every single one you’ve ever made, they’re my favorite. It’s been so much fun seeing you grow from Vine to YouTube! I can’t wait to see what the next chapter in your life holds! Whatever it is, I’m sure it will be wonderful and your true fans will follow you wherever you go. 🥰
didn't the title just say the retirement of jeffree a second ago?
It makes me so sad to think the Jeffree doesn't think he still has fans on YouTube who care about his videos. Maybes its just because I'm a 32 year old grannie turning 33, but I still LOVE YouTube! I specifically go to YouTube daily to watch viedos for pure enjoyment. I even signed up for YouTube premium last year so I could watch add free haha. If YouTube doesn't make him happy anymore I totally get that! But there are people I'm sure that will always watching his videos.
And ryland's hair looks extra luxurious and more full.  Good job. (Please don't ever shave it again)
I've noticed a lot of my favourite creators no longer make content and it's made me move to different platforms just to veg out after work. So I feel for the comment it's time to move on.
It hurt my heart hearing Jeffree say he’s leaving and that no one cares about YouTube anymore. I literally come on here every day and see if Ryland, Shane or Jeffree has updated their pages. If not, I rewatch old videos/series. I literally love them and their dynamic. I won’t know what to do with myself if they actually leave! 😭
Omg I got so sad and my heart broke into pieces when Jeffree said he’s quitting YouTube 😢 I’m still here and watching and liking ❤ but it’s understandable ❤
Nooo youtube is absolutely not dead. I don't have cable and tiktok makes me drained after 20 mins, steaming services I will only open for a specific show.... youtube is my escape and brings me a smile every morning and night.
Wow, I feel like I just got off the most epic emotional roller coaster, and i say that in the most positive way possible! ! I feel so happy to see 2 of my fave youtubers being in such a better place mentally and yet so freaking sad to hear that jeffree is going to be done with YouTube. I can't imagine being in the spotlight and under a microscope for how long they've been...how do you get through that without being emotionally  and mentally scarred in some type of way? I could not imagine being judged on my past and present to such an extreme level! You gotta do you, girl! Thank you for this series, I can't wait for the next episode! 💜🖤
Love it but for real. Growing up on an equine breeding farm omg....the money they have. I could only wish. Shane for sure never has  been on a farm lol. I have had to birth so many horses it's no joke but in the end worth it. I've had to reach in and help so many births.
Jeffree looks good, skin glowing, natural brows and the guns 🤣 he’s living
Jeffrey, no one watches anymore, Shane's video up for 3 hours and already has 200k+ views 💀   But still do what makes YOU happy xx
Why is there a tiny clip of downtown Athens, Georgia???
Everyone is saying that they were shocked when Jeffrey said that he was putting YouTube but honestly I kind of saw it coming… He doesn’t really upload as much as he used to and during this video when he was talking about short form content and how he can make videos in Balk and get like 3x the amount of views…it just makes sense for Jeffery
Jeffree, you still have millions of fans that love to watch you. It may not be 30 million anymore, but we’re still here. Even if it’s you just talking to a camera about nothing, we’d watch. We love your personality, and jokes, and charisma. Your energy through a camera lense comforted me and a lot of other people. I understand you wanting to be done though, and support you. But just know if you ever wanted to check in with us on YouTube, we’d still be here.
Was this video not originally named “The Retired World of Jeffree Star” with a different thumbnail and short hair on Jeffree? Or am I going insane?
I watch and I care 🥺💕
I'd be terrified of aliens or sk*nwalkers or maybe even scary country people out there. Is he by himself?! Does security live there? Just him and Maddie? I have so many questions.
JS makeup YT videos was an interest. The light when out 2018/9. Shane hanging on like this, is just a Stockholm thing. Just like a hard chug nut.   Don't ruin Ryland's Vlogs and Shane2 podcast when you just weathered the storm.   We have a saying for this in the UK but moving to a new location means nothing, if your attitude doesn't change. You can edit differently but it doesn't change reality.   Really sad as i was enjoying Rylands vlogs and the podcast. I just don't think i can spend my time on this car crash.
Noooo you can’t end it on that! Jeffree just needs to switch to filming and providing education about the yaks and the business side of it because I know I’d watch the hell out of that and it would hit a whole new demographic. I just don’t want jeffree to leave and I NEED a ghost hunting video:{
I am so happy to see everyone together!!!
Growing up with Jeffree Star, from following him on MySpace and watching his youtube videos it hurts to hear him say he’s quitting and no one watches anymore.  I still watch youtube every single day, I will pick this over any other streaming app any day. I guess it’s nostalgia, I don’t know. Whatever, it’s sad regardless.
Everyone's bullshit towards you guys made you reach for self discovery in a new light and it's beautiful 😍 CREATE with your heart and I'm so proud of you guys!!!  To see you living with peace of mind while still being able to share with those who won't ever stop loving you means so much for everyone more than you probably realize (even for yourself ;))
Seeing you two back together has been soooo much fun!!! 😂😂😂
ive been saying yt is dying since like 2018/2019
I absolutely love all of your videos. They are my comfort and i watch them all the time and look forward to them coming out. Really help me to relax and escape. Please jeffree know that they are not a waste of time and even if as many people dont click as they used to, the ones that are appreciate it so much❤
I still love Jeffree so so so much I’m so sad that he’s done 😭 I can’t deal with being left out of his life he’s my absolute idol, but I’m glad that he’s doing the Jenna Marbles and just living  ❤️ I’m glad Shane is back though it’s just what I needed!!!❤️❤️🥹
Been waiting for this again! Love yall together ❤️
That ending felt like a stab in the gut 😢 I think YouTube is still the place to be tbh bc all the TikTok stars know they need to capitalise on their fame while they're on a hot streak and start a YT channel. Also I NEED A PARANORMAL SERIES IN WYOMING THANKS
Noticed t he change in title... ;)
Shane's skin looks really good. Like, super good. Good job
shane has such pretty eyes
I’m obsessed with a jeffree just vibing out at the tiny wyoming airport😂
Shane and Jeffree look amazing and seem so happy.  For the record all I watch is YouTube
I love this!!! I’ve missed you two so much such! Keep up the amazing content Shane xoxoxo
I'm still always on YouTube in my free time lol. I'm glad Jeffree got away from California. Same with you and Ryland.
I'm glad that Jeffree is making the choice to quit YouTube...is it sad and heartbreaking...of course...we all love hopping on and watching the new review or crazy fun dog updates...but him finally doing something for himself that makes his soul happy and not having to worry about pleasing millions of people is such an inspiration to me...we now live in a world that is practically controlled by social media and I think a lot of us have forgotten how to just sit back and enjoy life as it was ment to be enjoyed...with the ones you love doing the things you love...good on him for realizing that before it was to late...we love all of you and will always have the old videos to watch but we will also have all of the wonderful memories that you shared with us along your journey...enjoy your new chapter in life Jeffree...cant wait to get out to Wyoming to get some STAR RANCH YAK BURGERS!!!!
Please don't quit YouTube - I think you have the power to show people that this kind of content has so much more value and quality. With a good and healthy approach (e.g. not giving in to the toxic side of it) you could rock this baby and have a lovely fun time with all your supporters.
Honestly jeffree, I still wait for you to put out your youtube videos, reviews and media... If you quit, please upload on your own website so we can still enjoy you in video format!
jeffree seems so genuinely happy :) I'm so thank to see you guys back together
Love this duo always
I care about YouTube! I definitely go and watch the ppl who inspire me. But I definitely don’t watch beauty anymore, so I get it.
Jeffree Star's life on Star Ranch reminds me so much of living on the reservation (rez). It's true, being surrounded by nature is refreshing and can tame a chaotic life.
I sadly agree with jeffree and I noticed the downward trend with YouTube during the pandemic 😢
21:58 WHEN JEFFERY PULLS OUT THE FUCKING GUN I DIED LAUGHING
This series better not end with them deciding to release the stupid palette
Tell jeffree to get one of the salt shotguns instead of the bug zapper lol it’s way more fun to kill bugs that way
I’m on the edge of my FUCKING seat
I will always love & continue to watch YouTube. Nothing compares!
Oh my god i need a ghost series with jeffree
I’m commenting on this video now and I haven’t even finished the video. Shane you and Jeffree are magic on camera together. I love this series so much already. 💕
Not gonna lie The ending of this video made me incredibly sad! I don’t know if it’s just the elder Millennial in me but my late teen heard were spent on YouTube, and I still watch it every single day to this day. I lost Jenna marbles, so it’s sad to see more people I’ve been watching for years leave.
Just a PSA I love everything you and ryland do shane. I will never stop watching both of your videos ❤ they bring me so much comfort and happiness
It makes me sad Jeffree is leaving YouTube but he needs to do what is right for him.  Live your best life, and he definitely is. 😊
I love Jeffree’s new lifestyle. Literally living peaceful in the country, it just warms my heart that he’s happy.
I still love YouTube 😭
This GENUINELY made me giggle and so happy. Seeing you two together again just made my heart warm. Very excited for this series ❤️
This video made me so happy. Seeing Jeffree so happy and carefree and just content is so inspiring. People need to let go and just unplug like this! Shane you have done amazing babe! I can’t wait to see what is next!
Jeffree Star's Stardew Valley life
Me watching YouTube for relaxation and fun: 😐 lmfaooo am I old or something
Bahahaha Shane nearly shat himself holding 🔫😂
It’s just me but does Jeffery Star looks like he’s glowing. He looks so beautiful and at peace! So happy for him!
Well that sucks! Ive been actually wanting new Jeffree videos! Just not product reviews, i wanna see his lifestyle. & Him and a new boyfriend! We dont get anything outta tiktok 😭
HEY DON’T THINK I DIDN’T NOTICE THAT TITLE CHANGE! 🤨
Omg U guys if Shane was an animal he'd b a hybrid sloth cross teddy bear he looks so god Dame cuddly 🌻☀️🐻🤘💋🌸🐻🧚🌺💞🐻💐💖🦋🐻
I still love watching YouTube 😊
"No one watches it, no one cares"...well I guess i'm no one.  How dismissive and arrogant but then again this is Jeffree....Now if you said it has no value for me personally  because I'm not making any revenue from it then I would be more understanding....but to generalize in such a way that makes it seem youtube has no valve at all is stupid.  I don't use tiktok....I'm almost 40 and have no use for the platform.  I prefer longer content.  Maybe youtube doesn't have the numbers it once did but that doesn't mean it has no value to people.  Maybe jeffree should lighten up on making sweeping statements....things arent just black or white.  His judgment is exactly consistent ....one minute going to the taco bell hotel and being the king of taco bell/fast food then the next denouncing fast food  and how poisonous and disgusting it is.  Gurllll stop flip flopping.  I'm sure it's just all about the money and the business standpoint ...but then say that...
I'm watching this with my wife and I'm a veteran, so I know guns. So yeah, dude, Jeff's Beretta 90two was on fire with the hammer back. Some one please tell him to flip the safety downwards to safe. 🤯🤯
Giving chills already ahh I’m so exited
Now the next one pleaseeeee
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! DONT LEAVE YOUTUBE! I genuinely don’t now what to do. I’ve been growing with you Shane for over 10 years now. You don’t know me and probably never will and yet I feel like your a friend. Even through the cancelation I was genuinely sad seeing you go. There are many of us who care and love you and your family ❤❤❤❤
Ughhhh the cliffhanger 🥺 I LOVE THIS SERIES!!
I get new people don’t come find YouTube like before but fans still come
Sad to see Jeffree go 🥺 but people grow and move on to better adventures. Im going to miss his content.
I don’t think YouTube is dying. It probably seems that way bc people aren’t really going to YouTube for beauty content as much since Tiktok took off over the pandemic
Don't EVER quit youtube please shane lol
There is so much noise from the camera being handled in this video, ugh.
Don't worry. A narcissist never changes anything other than their obsessions. Lol
Not sure what he’s talking about, YouTube is still very much alive and will always be an relevant platform. He lost some viewers and fans, so what? I mean it happens to everyone eventually, doesn’t really mean he should quit. Neither does it mean, the app or website is terrible now. Everyone’s on here back and forth, everyday or a couple, for different reasons.
a vibe
Shane we love you. This was amazing, can't wait for part 3 to come out
This feels like the end of an era.
Ironic it’s not getting many views…
i disagree w him, i fucking love youtube
Us OG subscribers do not want YouTube to fade out I look forward to long uploads over short style videos ❤ it’s sad that the content creators think we don’t want it anymore….
I just love Shane and jeffree together ❤❤
Jeffree and Shane series comeback is what I needed in my life right now! It's good to see you guys reconnect 🖤 and your editing Shane is my fave. Never stop.
PETITION FOR SHANE TO MOVE TO WYOMING!!!!!!!!!!! I love Jeffree and Shane content sooo much, and it's so peaceful there from Jeffree's experience, so I feel like it would bring good vibes to Shane :)
I don’t know how to feel about him leaving YouTube. I love watching his videos. It’s almost too hard to believe
Shane and Ryland  Don't listen to Jeffree we love your videos on YouTube!! Keep them coming!!
I watch YouTube literally every day. Granted I don't watch the same channels as I used to (i.e., Jeffree's) because interests change and evolve, but I still get a lot of joy and use out of it. Maybe Jeffree's style of content is just not as popular as it used to be, or too much drama has happened and it's time for him to move on. Best of luck to him sincerely! I also think the app itself has just made it not worth it for content creators to stay and that makes me really sad. I love Tik Tok as well, but it's definitely not the same!
It's not like he's leaving social media, anyone who wants to keep up with Jeffree can do so daily. He barely puts out videos anyway. So what was the point of announcing your leaving YT because it's sucks and it's dead in a docuseries you are making FOR YouTube?! 🧐🤨
It’s the end of an era with jeffree star leaving YouTube.
Nooooo! I watch! I care! 😞😞
I’m so sad that there will no longer be Jeffree videos bc I do love watching him. Meh…… Shane you definitely cannot quit now. I’ll have no one….
i can't wait.  missed you both
These two together. I would watch everyday, but I totally respect and understand the decision to leave YouTube. Love you both.
I really fucking care about YouTube. It raised me and it has helped me through every tough experience I’ve gone through, but it’s not YouTube, it’s the creators *cough* *cough* y’all!
Bitch when he pulled the gun out 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I love YouTube. TikTok is fun for comedy but I much rather watch YouTube videos - blogs, how tos, everything.
I love how chill y'all are with the cancellation stuff now. Like who needs to give a fuck, just vibe and live your lives, that shit doesn't matter
awe i miss thisss duo
You guys seriously, I love you both so so much, I laughed with you, I cry, I yell at my phone… how you pulled all of us in was just crazy. Been watching you for years and you could never do me no wrong, never cancelled you, never will. I just know in my heart you are deserving of success both of you. Congrats on everything and keep it up, wherever from !!! That was perfect entertainment : full of love and joy !!!
F***£ing gonna miss Jefree- he is a staple with you Shane that created THE most epic series to date. Please let our dearest beloved Jafar - We Love him & will always be here to click his story times- reveals- Truth is always spoken with you all. Your icon status FOREVER. ❤️💯🔥
I choose YouTube over TIKTOk anyday.
FINALLY YESSSS!!!!
I find it funny when jeffree says no one watches him and im siting here waveing mybarms while jumping up and down saying im over here i wat h u also i watch shanes to and rylins as well i hope i spelt  his name right
Not me only on YouTube everday and haven't opened my TikTok in months!
Shane and Jeffree's vibe is ELETRIC! I felt like I was in the car on the drive back to the ranch 😍🤣
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy♡♡♡♡♡♥︎♡♡ Love this new series♡ so happy to see them back together♡♡♡♡♥︎
Honestly, I feel like the cancellation was good for Jeffrey's mental health because he really seems to be very happy now and I'm proud of both of them.
Jesus. The ending had me struck. I’m beyond shocked.  I love you Shane. And Jeffree.  ❤. But damn the reality for us over 30 to mid to late 30 year olds are still stuck in our past.  😢❤
Post the next video NEOWWWWW. 😭😭
I can’t believe it’s been 4 years since some of those clips , feels like yesterday time is flying . Love you Shane!
I’m so happy and proud of all of you!❤🎉😊
This was so good.
I understand people aren’t clicking as much for makeup videos, so from Jeffree’s stand point I totally get it, being that make up is his business he needs to make business decisions. BUT!!! I would love to see a few day in the life videos, its amazing and comforting seeing how he’s chosen to live more humble, and downsized his life.   I still watch youtube all day every day but its obvious creators are stepping back.   Loving this series! So happy you decided to make it :)
Let Jeffree know I still watch him on YouTube!!  I love the vlogs!!!   Thank you Shane for your content and videos and thank you Jeffree! much love to all of you!!
I’m so sad to hear jeffree wants to quit YouTube but I totally understand. He’s been around forever and he’s living a totally different life now. Ahhhh I’m not sure how I personally feel but it’s not about what we want from him; it’s about what he wants to do
I’m glad to see them both moving on in life. Sure he did want all the hype but now he’s content with what he has now. No phones or TMZ. He’s happy and eventually we all grow up. He’s still making that money tho! 💰
This actually made me sad at the end. Youtube needs to rebrand. I still go back and watch the old stuff because of how good they were.
this hurts worse than a heartbreak
Jeffree couldn’t have said it any better. It’s bitter sweet but he knows, he gets it. and he told you first
I wonder if his mom moved with him?
I love casper..been in that airport more than I can count my ex husband's family live just past it out in the middle of no where and love the town but umm..there was a horrible history of violence towards gas individuals..a boy literally got murdered on college from only existing and being a guy individual..I pray people remember thag
Is that .. a SILENCER lol
Writing here because I know you don’t check insta DM. I am having SO MUCH FUN watching this. Like seriously my evening was made and I’m cracking up. This is so perfect. Jeffree was so excited to see you and you him. I can feel his happiness and I love that we have all grown in these past 2 years 🎉
ICONIC! Shane, please never stop YT! Jeffree, you look amazing and happy and just so different in the best way, words can’t even explain! Shane, Ryland and Chris, y’all are giving me life, this series, the pod,the list goes on. You guys all work so hard and deserve all the success!
Pov: us on YouTube when he says no one watches YouTube anymore 👁️👄👁️
Jeffrey’s face after he called Ryland an asshole was soo adorable!
Loved it Shane! Great job.
Not gonna lie… it made me feel real old when Jeffree said he’s gonna be done with YouTube, how it’s like MySpace and nobody’s ever on it anymore, everybody’s on tik tok. I’ve lived through MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, IG, etc.- yanno all the greats. And yet I’m still on YT almost everyday, and on FB and IG here and there. I’ll watch shorts and reels and whatever, but I stillllll have yet to sign up for TikTok. …….I’m 26….. when did I become so uncool, old, and out of the loop wtf 😅😅😅
Never thought I would see the day that jeffree star quit YouTube my heart just dropped 😕🥺 but I’m glad he’s happier now and thriving !!!🤍
Not gonna lie but that last part did hit me like a ton of bricks. I mean I'm all for people doing what makes them happy. But I wasn't ready for that. I am loving this though. I hope this didn't come out disrespectful
38:14 tell me why I clocked the hobbit being played on the tv in the background 💀💀💀
Shane and Jeffree are Magic ❤
I cannot wait for the rest
Jeffree looks so much healthier and happier. He is a complete different person. A great reminder that luxury and money is not the key to happiness
I still love youtube ❤️please none of you stop posting
Jeffree literally telling the haters to bring it on. I LOVE IT!! way to go Jeffree.
I love how effortlessly funny Jeffree always is. The whole bit when they're just sitting parked in the Hummer had me dying laughing. I love that Jeffree had found a place to live away from the drama of LA and he seems to truly be at ease every time he's with you Shane! You have such a gift for making people feel comfortable and accepted and I love your rapport with Jeffree. You can tell he trusts you a lot!
Jeffree is fucking glowing
The Retirement of Jeffree Star?
Seeing Jeffree and Shane together again just makes my heart so happy!! I love y’all’s friendship so much! I am definitely sad Jeffree not wanting to do YouTube anymore. I love his reviews,  but times do change and so you have to roll with it. So proud of you both and your growth!! Love y’all
Release the palette Shane!!! We want it
YouTube helped propel and start so many  career’s and Jeffree gets between 500k-1 million views on any new launch from thousands upon thousands of loyal followers, who go there for his content specifically and enjoyment. But no, no one cares about it or is on it… 🙄 it’s all about views, popularity and trending not this simple life farmer persona.
Wait, new pants, new jacket, new life, same shirt would be bad ass merch for a shirt lol
I can't help but enjoy the whimsy of this series so far, I get such nostalgia from both Shane and Jeffree.  CANCELLED pallet and mini MELTDOWN would be such a legit thing for the two of them to release.
I love how Jeffree thinks YouTube is dead but if he’d do vlogs on his ranch I’d literally watch every single one 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
So did y’all see the elderly checking out Ryland! 😂 And was that a silencer on Jeffree’s gun? 😯
Glad to see you guys collaborating again!😊
I think I smiled through this whole thing, so happy to see you both together again❤
Love this please release the palette!!
Love the life  you live!!!!!!!
Hearing Jeffrey say that, as I’m piled on the couch watching this video on my TV😂😂
Omg Jeffree Star is done with YouTube. Jeffrey said no one watches YouTube anymore .. wtf I do!! Lol .  Shane, Jeffree and a couple of others are the original bad bitches of YouTube. (Eww I can't believe how cringe that sounded)  seeing everyone in their zen is awesome and I want to see more! I live in Colorado and Jeffree and Shane should do a meet and greet before Jeffree retires!
Jeffree your fans are STILL here on youtube. I will always watch if the content is there.
This needs to be like 3 hours not 55 minutes Absolutely loved it  Good job shane really
It’s so humbling of the fact you found it shocking that two years later people still use your palette! I use mine every day and still get so many compliments on how beautiful the palette is! It will always be my favorite pieces of makeup!!
Me running over to TikTok because I realized I don’t follow JS
The end of the video had my eyes water up. I'm happy for Jeffery but for him to have negatives thoughts about YouTube kinda hurt. I have mixed emotions but I'm overall so happy for Jeffery and where he's at. It's heart breaking to see you go but I knew it was gonna happen sometime. I just wish it wasn't now
I’ve been watching both Shane and Jeffree from day one. Watching them together gives me so much joy. They truly are like cosmic when they come together. And watching Shane and Ryland and the whole crew bring so much joy into my life. It seriously gives me something to look forward to. Every week I’m looking for new uploads. SHANE ILYSM, you’re so incredibly talented and creative and so so many wonderful things. And I know I sound dramatic but I don’t know what I would do if you ever left!! 💖💖💖💖
I missed you guys together. It really is amazing to see how much Jeffree has changed. I think it's amazing what he's doing with his life now. Also, I know the younger generation may not watch YouTube as much but there's still millions of people who do. I still really enjoy YouTube and watch it more than any other app. I also understand that Jeffree has been doing it for a long time and if he feels it's time to move on to something else then he needs to follow his heart. Oh, and Jeffree should name his arcade The Starcade ⭐😉
.. I still go look up my favorite YouTubers and watch 👀
I can’t wait to see the pallet 😢 I wasn’t able to get one last time but if this is released i 100% am gonna get it
wow. I will miss JStar 100 percent! just saying!! I watch all of his videos. <3
I mean I get it, when you go from 50M views to 550k views it’s not worth his time.
here we go again
Jeffree looks great
Let me get my hands on that pepper jerky  😍
Not ryland ruining the moment of Shane saying everything is new but the shirt 😭
So true Jeffrey although YouTube doesn’t push your videos I’m subscribed but haven’t had you in my feed or notifications… hmmmm  Yes there’s all the other streamers but YouTube’s free so I’m still watching !
I’m going to be honest, I will actually miss Jeffree. I remember MySpace days and putting him on my Top 5. I was probably in 8th grade when I really started watching YouTube, coming home after school and watching daily videos. Now I’m 29 with 3 kids and still enjoy watching videos while I fold laundry or cook dinner, listening to podcast when I do my carpooling. I cried when Jenna left us and I know I’ll cry when Jstar leaves next. I just hope Shane & Ryland hold onto YouTube a little longer for our sake. It’s good to see Jeffree doing so well, he looks happy. ❤
😮😢😊🥹🖤
I really hope that by Jeffery saying he is quitting YouTube doesn't mean shane and Ryland are going to quit. I love all of your videos and they are the highlight of my day.  You guys got me through highschool, college and now my everyday life. Please don't stop creating  🙏
It feels so good to be back ya! Happy for all of them.
Shane, you better not leave. Just get a tiktok too 😊 you can do both!
We love YouTube!!!! Shane, don’t stop making videos!
Shane can you stop the cringe snapchat stories ?
Ryland consistently being a pick me girl..lord, these people's energy is exhausting for sure
haven’t even watched it and i ALREADY FKN KNOWWW THIS SHIT BOUTTA BE GOOD
haven’t even watched it and i ALREADY FKN KNOWWW THIS SHIT BOUTTA BE GOOD
shane asking if he’s allowed to touch the gun LMAO
I still watch your channel Jeffree. 🥺
I love Jeffrey and Shane together ❤️
End of a legend if Jeffree leaves YouTube. 😭
Am I insane or was this originally titled ‘the retirement of Jeffrey Starr’?   Is Shane gaslighting me?!
Did anyone else notice the light pink bandana in Rylands back pocket at 38:10 ?  Thats code for something right 🙊
I’m so sad to hear the news about Jeffree..
why do you keep making videos with this mf
rylands so cute
I love how jefree acknowledge her ego and let it go. Love how she is now more relaxed but still love nice things
Damn cliff hanger!!!!  Lol.  ❤❤❤❤ this and never want it to end and hell yes I’d buy a 2nd palette from y’all.
Uhhh wasn't this just a different name...?
yessss a shane/jeffree ghost hunt is needed!
you needed to see your buddy jeff 2,...im happy your back together <3
I miss these vibes 😭😭  I love ya’ll ❤️
whats wild to me is last time Shane and Jeffree did a series Jenna was still on youtube and apologized for posting on national shane dawson day <3 miss you Jenna
I still love You Tube, it's my absolute favorite. I'm truly sad to see you go J⭐️
if you're a piggy, heeey, if you're not Shut the flup up!, we already lost jenna we are lucky to have shane back DONT RUIN IT, 😒 (ps im so happy your home shane ❤) yt is not the same without you
I still watch YouTube daily and would be so devastated if Shane quit too 🥺💔 we can’t lose Jeffree, Jenna and Shane 😭
Fuck. I'm shattered. I love Jeffree. No YouTube? Whew. Need to process. Don't do it Jeffree. Stay.
The ending of this was intense! ❤
I love watching your content Shane. I love seeing you and Jeffree together. You guys are a couple of my favorites!
Jeffrees vids have a million plus views even now, why he think nobody watches??
Omg so many questions like first I can’t believe so many ppl leaving you tube he’s wrong I stop watching tv and only watch you tube and tik tok only I look forward to it and second after he had that crash I would be scared to ever drive fast but I guess that’s just me  So many questions but they will never be answered I’m so sad
I am only 13 minutes in but I just have to say how much I love this friendship and I feel like it’s a rare lifetime kind of thing. I’ve watched both of you grow into the humans you’re meant to be and as cliche as this sounds…your guys’ futures are so bright, my soul can FEEL it.
This new jeffree is fire
I love this series and yes Jeffere i still watch all your videos on you tube
This fucked me up a bit. I hope jeffree knows how much people still watch. I binge yalls videos all the time. This series goes beyond the last 2.
Unfortunately to an extent Jeffery is right, what made YouTube the most popular thing has been fizzling down for the last couple years because of streaming - people use to have to make more of a choice of just wating to see what was on TV/Cable, if nothing good turn to YouTube and the limited streaming offerings. Covid hits and streaming took off bigtime. People aren't just clicking in for one-off videos, people either just want to speed thru tictocs / shorts and move on. OR they want series type content. Even then people want to binge watch thru and do a one and done sitting, less patience to sit and wait week to week for new videos (or tv episodes). Its all about instant gratification. And when they do watch a video they want the content to carry over to the next one or have videos/episodes cram in as much as possible into a longer form video, no more 12min and dones. The trouble is content creator don't want to risk/can't afford to put in a shit ton of work, money and effort into an hour long video if it isn't going to draw a few million views right off the bat, the window to make money is super short and if there isn't a sponsor, forget about it.   Hell, Matt Damon did an episode of Hot Ones and explained how the shift from DVD sales to streaming has killed how movies are made/the kind of movies studios will put money towards, because they can't make their money back without physical sales. and to an extent it is the same thing that's happening to YouTube, money has shifted, people can just stream shows and movies so they don't need YouTube content like they use to.  I still come on every day for stuff to watch - mostly listen to, there are content creators I love and can't wait to see each and every new vid. And I've noticed a LOT of the content creators I use to follow have been disappearing over the last two - three years. It sucks, but it's a reallity. Some have thankfully shifted to more podcast content to fill in the gaps in posting so I can still get some of their content, but many have just said enough is enough and dipped out of content creation all together because their content can't adapt to new media - painters/sculptors can't really thrive in a non-visual media.  Will it suck to see Jeffery cut out YouTube, yes, (I don't have TicTok) so there's one less creator to watch. But he seems soooooo much happier now, so good for him. Be happy in what makes him happy.
150 Yacks FINALLY LEVELLED OUT
"No one watches YouTube anymore."  Except the 2.6 million people that watched part one of this. 🤣😅
first i will like to say i would love to see Shane and Jeffrey do a ghost hunt video i think that would be everything. but hearing Jeffrey saying he is quitting youtube really was surprising and honestly it hurt literally started crying.
I’m literally dying at the whole g*n scene 😅 Jeffree has literally started over and living his best life! Proud of him
I'm glad Jeffree is happy but I think it sucks that he's quitting YouTube. I think more people watch than he realizes and, btw, I hate TikTok. Loving this series!
Sad... but I get it.  However   People. Still. Watch YouTube.  Lol
I can see they are really moved on and so do we. Holding hate against someone that was decades ago and just waste now. I'm happy to see them moving on from the past
Love you all sooooo much! thank you for the content! BIG LOVE XOXOXOO!
I know that Jeffrey is deciding to leave you too, but I don’t want Shane to get in his head and leave YouTube as well. It’s too upsetting we lost Jenna I don’t wanna lose another person💔
You forgot STAR RACH! Lmao
I AM SO FREAKING GLAD YOU ARE POSTING THESE SHANE! I LOVE YOUR CONTENT! DON’T KNOW WHY I AM TYPING IN ALL CAPS LMAO🤣🤣
Youtube is 100% my place. I am not interested in short 60-120 second content! I still wanna do exactly what Jeffree said, sit on the couch and watch youtube.
Me being back on youtube after a hiatus bc I'm bored of having to change the video I'm watching every few seconds. It just depends on the mood. I'm wishing people still posted to YouTube as much as they used to. Then itd be more poppin
WHAT???!!! Jeffree QUITING YT???!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg no 😲.
23:50 is in Athens, GA lol - not quite Wyoming 😂
I don’t think I have ever heard of a Yak, I seriously don’t know what that is 🫤
Jeffree looks so happy and so much healthier
I really only watch YouTube so it was sad to hear Jeffree say it’s dead but it’s kinda true. It’s really only lifestyle videos now
Well, I still watch YouTube everyday. I dont watch to much of tictok because there just shorts. I still like the long video.  YouTube may be going away for some but not everyone.
Sounds like he went over to the other side of the mountain on his opinions.  I will always watch Shane.
I LOVE YOUTUBE and watch videos every day. I look forward to seeing you and Ryland and your families and pets so please don't be disheartened by Jeffree's relationship with YouTube. I find TikTok exhausting, it can be fun for a little while but I want to relax and watch a good long video and that's the content you and Ryland and Morgan provide. I'm very grateful for the videos you make and post Shane and Ryland so please don't think you're wasting your time here.
Honestly, the algorithm is in SUCH a horrible state that you're required to do INSANE clickbait even more than ever before, lean into nsfw content to get views or just... give up. It's a struggle.
YouTube is defiantly still my favorite way to watch you Shane!! Please don't ever leave us
OMG I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH!😭😭😭One request though, I notice in this in all shane and rylands videos but the music gets really really loud compared to the talking. For headphone users it can be kind of jarring! Not sure if anyone else experiences this or if its fixable in editing but just thought id point it out! Super sad to see jeffree leave youtube though, Ive been watching you both since highschool and Im 31 now! LOVE YOU BOTH!
girl im on youtube 24/7
My heart snuck when Jeffree none watches YouTube like yeah we do 🙃 pls do it leave but if it doesn’t make you happy of course we will miss you 😢
🫶🏻
wow i’ve never felt depressing and emptiness after a shane video 🙁 i guess we’re growing up and life is changing 🙁 f tiktok
Hearing youtube is dead made sense to me its not the first place look for some thing to watch
I love Jeffery with eyebrows ❤
Jeffree looks goooood with eyebrows😍
I loved EVERYTHING about this!
First thing I do when I get home is turn on YouTube :(
Ok just finished this and WOW. So many emotions
So like we getting the pallet or….
That makes me so sad to hear. I love YouTube! Still watch, still here! but I also understand it’s not worth the drama.
I love you and I love Jeffrey I'm so sad that hes quitting YouTube I hate TikTok I won't download it so I guess this is the end
It's called shadow banning lol. Not YouTube being dead.
People care about youtube still, i guess yall dont realize smaller youtubes exist.
I just wish the camera man would shut up the other one was better
53:30 - 53:46 i DO JEFFREE :) FOR ME... CALL ME OLD SCHOOL  True fan here for Jeffree,  Ryland, and Shane
why title change?
Jeffree is you’re reading this, YouTube is dead I agree, but you’re still STAR honey we still love u
It makes me so sad to know Jeffrey is quitting YouTube. I LOVE his videos!
Jeffrey is so much fun
I love this but should I feel bad that I still watch YouTube???
I love YouTube but I have to admit I love other platforms.. JEFFREY looks very sad 😔
God mi so happy for jeffre, bug steg that not alot of celeb do ❤❤
Jeffree looks so happy and healthy!! ❤️
I still watch YouTube 🤷‍♀️ love jeffree but maybe no one's watching him anymore. He's in a different class of Merican now. So it's not surprising that he's leaving YouTube .
Jeffree looks AMAZING. He is so good looking.
Jeffree, no one is watching you. There’s a difference.
I watch u tube, Netflix  hulu...utube don't suck...I watch utube all the time...I watch u  Jeffrey and Shane and morgan. I don't watch tic tok or have face book or any other social media. Maybe I'm still old school.
I still love this and I hope you and Ryland continue! It’s sad jeffree is leaving but so far he seems really at peace with it. But I love watching you and Ry!
It's crazy how you two together immediately eliminates my depression. We def need a Wyomijg ghost hunter series with Jeffree or where he shows you how to shoot guns and take care of yaks lol.
I like I’m a huge fan of all of you even rylan
"It's a little gay" says the guy man lmfao
Awwww I love YouTube so much so it makes me sad :(.
I still watch youtubeee 🥲
JEFFREE DO NOT CONVINCE HIM TO QUIT YOUTUBE !!!
I barely get on YT anymore. It’s true. The only reason I get on YouTube is to literally watch YOU Shane, and YOU ryland. Rylands vlogs and Shane’s podcast. Everyone and everything else is on TT now. That’s so true.
this is so fake bro, ik u guys are gonna sell it obviously just be up front, id still watch the series, idc.
I barely get on YT anymore. It’s true. The only reason I get on YouTube is to literally watch YOU Shane, and YOU ryland. Rylands vlogs and Shane’s podcast. Everyone and everything else is on TT now. That’s so true.
No ones clicking ? Have you heard of mr beast ? Or ? No one wants to click on this bullshit makeup drama that’s the reality YouTube has more viewers than any other platform on earth ha
Rehab lol 😂
I know I'm no one, but I'm still a YouTube LOVER. I can't STAND the repeat and short video style of TikTok. HATE it. YouTube is my favorite... it breaks my heart that the loves of my life on YouTube are hanging up their buttons. I'll miss and always love you Jeffree. In the meantime, I'll be looking forward to every gold nugget you drop Shane 😘
I go to YouTube everyday for enjoyment still! Fuck those tic tok crap
I still watch YouTube everyday. I hope you don't quit Shane or Ryland.
Patiently waiting for the return of Jenna marbles docuseries by Shane pls n tank u 👁👄👁
At 14:09 Shane did you just officially reveal the palettes name is cancelled at the airport?😮❤
Jeffree star does good make make up my boy went and bought me a few after saying I love him and Shane but even before
Shit I still always watch YouTube
That YouTube statement is not true. I always come here for joy. It’s the content you create that isn’t it anymore.
Id enjoy Jeffree yak content! I’d watch on YouTube.
When Jeffrey said I’m quitting YouTube my heart literally broke
Don't leave yt jefree 🥺🥺🥺 Youtube is still my main go to for entertainment...  (Tiktok never appealed to me) Bur will support you w/ whatever makes you guys happy & at peace 💗💗
Yass Jeffree with the gun safety! Everyone should know how to safely handle a firearm 🙃
I still watch YouTube on the daily ☹️
shane please for the love of god dont leave youtube
I knew Jeffree isn’t a liberal he’s way to smart and worked his way to nothing to something
don't delete it I would love to look back. just dont post
There is definitely someone living under his house
I am too old for TikTok, mid 30s and I just can't, I would completely miss watching Jeffrey on YouTube. I get it, been with you since the myspace day, I'll miss watching.
Your guys vibe is sooo awesome. Love every minute ❤️❤️
The pandemic showed so many people our raw selves & time to process what we wanted in life when we were STRIPPED of all the chaos of work, meetings, parties, friends & going out that consumed our lives. SO many people moved out of California & quit their jobs to pursue other things. I hope this doesn't mean NO MORE MAKEUP????!!! OMG...
I love YouTube, it’s my happy place, so glad to see you all together ❤❤❤ Please, don’t leave YouTube Jeffree! Glad you are back Shane!
I would love to work for Jeffrey. I would worship the ground he walks on. I would take his secrets to my grave. I think it would be an amazing opportunity
I watch so much youtube hahahaha, it is not dying people are not interested in you, it is sad but the truth.
Been watching since before 2012. Truly wishing yall the best. ❤️
I'm dying over you holding a gun for the first time 😭 literally same, Shane
Yeasss scary series with jeffree and Shane iconic ❤❤
I loved this episode so much!!!! It was complete nostalgia & like catching up with an old friend. It was funny exciting & heartfelt but the ending definitely got me. I hate cancel culture & I hate what YouTube has turned into. It's just everyone exposing everyone for views. It's all hate & negativity & telling ppl to not watch other people but you guys have always been next level & wholesome with your content. I definitely don't ever want to say goodbye to you or Jeffree. 😢❤️
OK but when Jeffree star said that “it feels so right because it’s with you” was kind of creepy 🙄
53:17 I am 28 and I spend 40x more time on Youtube than TikTok. YouTube is reliable, dependable, familiar, comfortable, THERE FOR ME, nostalgic, enjoyable, educational, relaxing.   TikTok is NOT relaxing, not familiar, not a comfortable place. It's all new, random, strange, news, drama, trend, fast fashion. It's stressful. It's dividing. It's triggering. I go to TikTok maybe once a week for 5 minutes when I want something different. Like getting sushi once a month.   YouTube is my home, my every day. My 4 or more hours a day. My regulars, my news, my music, my tutorials, my safe comfy place, the background soundtrack to my life, the focus of my down time, the dependable, reliable resource for my work and hobbies.  TikTok is jarring and random and COLD and full of 10 second strangers that can only be taken in small doses.  I get it, if Jeffree wants to retire, he needs to do him. But do NOT place TikTok above YouTube for anyone who is not Gen Alpha or Gen Z
There’s something so sexy to Jeffery as a bi women. When he’s more masculine he’s very sexy and when he’s more feminine he’s very sexy.
It's sad to think about but yeah I rarely go on YouTube anymore.. I only come on to check on Shane or a few random things I like to watch but most of my time is spent on Roku stuff, tiktok, or on reading and writing apps. It's sad to see it dying. I was always on YouTube my entire life.
Sad to see Jeffery leave YouTube, when Shane decides it’s his time to retire it’ll definitely feel like it will be the end of a YouTube Era I’m not ready for it.. :(
" well does the drama happen if you don't see it"- Ryland <3  mood for 2023
This is everything! I know you dont read comments but i love you and Jeffery together. Your friendship is everything ❤️
Jeffree is not wrong - YouTube sucks. One by one, you're seeing more and more people step off the platform and move on, or completely change what they originally were on YouTube for, which changes their audience. And that's not even including the cancel culture where people refuse to allow the idea that people change, even though that's exactly what getting cancelled does for people.
He loud music has made it SOOO hard to watch all your videos 😢
Tiktok single handly ruined low form videos. . Tik too ruined everything tbh. It's a necessity but not actually fun.
Next video Shane and Jeffree open a portal to hell.
i LIVE on YouTube I love it and watch it  everyday I think that’s the new gen with tiktok making Jeffree feel that way even though YouTube has died down a bit there’s still LOTS of people that still love this app ! I would choose YouTube over tiktok and tv shows any day
First Jenna Marbles and now Jeffree.... NOOOOOOooooooooo
Lmaooo the airport killed me god I missed this duo
Jeffree and Shane leaving  YouTube makes me not even wanna watch anymore 😔😔
My heart would break if shane quit YouTube, but just like unus annus we get over things. End of the day they’re people :)
Am I the only one who finds it unsettling that I see these beautiful cute sweet furry Yaks knowing they will be killed? I don’t like that.
i watch this videos on this app daily and it makes me so so sad to hear “it’s dead” when i love it so much
I hate how sad Shane looked to hear him say that 😫 I love YouTube that’s what I grew up with and this is what I will be on until it is truly dead but ITS NOT DEAD YET
The vibes in this video is very melancholy. 🥺 But both Shane and jeffree seem to be in much better places now. I'm truly happy for them.
I missed your energy so much. So glad to be watching you two together!
words cannot describe how much i love their friendship 🥹
Ummm... youtube is dead?  Nobody watches it?  Yeah right!  No.. I think people are just burnt out on Jeffree's beauty reviews.  How many beauty reviews, and tutorials, pallette launches can you do before you get sick of watching it?  Who cares?  I don't.  We want other content than that Jeffree that is more entertaining.  Kinda like what Shane does.  Love you Shane.  Please don't listen to him.  I really look forward to ALL your content here on YouTube.
MANDELA EFFECT!!! I swear the title used to be "The Retirement of Jeffree Star" 3 hours ago
When Jeffree said "YouTube Sucks" it made me really sad. I still love watching YouTube ☹️
We love the GROWTH!!! 💚
Ok I just BAWLED KNOWING HE'S QUITTING YOUTUBE,  WTFFFF, I STILL WATCH EVERY VIDEO EVERY WOWWWWWWW JUST SAD!
All I watch is YouTube 😢
Watching Shane while high is one of my new personalities
I still come to watch the videos…
I still love both of you. It made me so mad seeing all the drama that unfolded. You guys are such great people and never deserved it all
When Jeffree said he’s quitting YouTube…… first of all STOP 🥺🤚🏻 second of all…WHEN HE SAID NO ONE WATCHES ANYMORE & THAT NO ONE CARES!!!! BITCH I WATCH YOUTUBE & I CARE!!!! I LOOKED FORWARD TO HIS VIDEOS….omg my heart is broken…😢 I’ll ALWAYS watch y’all ♥️
I don’t see how there is anyway to wrap this series in only one more video! Hopefully it’s 2 hours long!!
Stop! I am still watching 😢🙋‍♀️😂😂
I would be so down for some Shane and Jefree ghost hunts!
Jeffree is still getting millions of views... That's nothing? I'm confused. 🤷‍♀️
No one watches makeup on YouTube anymore… it’s all moved to tik tok at this point
Listen I fucking love you tube still ♡ I still watch it because I'm excited to! I won't ever let this type of content die! I hate short form content 😒 I'm 34 though so that's probably why! I watch all jeffrees videos ♡
Love the new jeffree! I'm a big lover of his makeup and own my own cattle too!
I definitely think YT sucks for creators. It's not like it used to be. But I am an elder millennial and still watch YouTube daily. I was sad when Shane cut back on videos and will be sad to see Jeffree go. And will forever miss Jenna Marbles.  Great docu-series Shane! Can't wait to see the rest
Jeffree and Shane, exactly what my heart needed! 😭😭
There’s no words to describe I how much I missed this ❤
Did anyone else notice the hammer was cocked back on Jeffree's handgun??😬
I think why YouTube feels dead is because all of our old favorites are leaving, but I believe that leaves room for a revival with new YouTubers to begin enjoying and creating new content
i miss them i feel like im back to 2019 before covid happens watching this.
I think the true fans will always watch any videos u and Shane post to YouTube like I’m so happy u guys are doing this I been wanting and needing this the true fans will always watch and they miss u guys
shane this content sucks what happened
The reunion I needed 🥹
THE FUCKING SUPPRESSOR ON THE GUN
Shane, your videos bring me so much comfort. I look forward to watching them in bed before i sleep. They calm any anxiety i have. Youtube is not dead, its my comfort app. Tiktok gives me anxiety😂 Keep up the good work❤️
“8 dogs” 🤣
Good! I'm glad he is getting out. Jeffery looks, sounds, and seems better then he ever has been. He has already transitioned into what he wants to do next. If i had the amount of money he had i would do the same thing, move away from everyone and be on my own running a homestead. Youtube is dead, When was the last time you found a new youtuber that was perfect for you, literally never. Peoples attention span cant handle youtube videos anymore its all reels and tik toks. I know you wont see this jeffery or shane but good for you! P.S Jeffery you look super hot btw lol love the country look/feel! XD
Love this!  More, more
Oh just because Jeffrey doesn’t get 30m views anymore he’s decided no one watches YouTube anymore?? If no one watches he wouldn’t have participated in this hour long commercial for his yak meat. Maybe people are sick of toxic creators who only thrive when there’s drama.
The place is called Casper. The haunting is in the namee
Omg no 🤦🏽‍♀️ I love u both❤
I watch real estate and The Dodo and that is pretty much it. I loved part 1 and cant wait for 2 & 3. I love Shane and Jeffree together. Just Magic!
Omg we need a whole Wyoming ghost hunting series!!!! 🖤🖤🖤
Noooooo Jeffree u can't quit!! How will I keep up with u?? I love u!! 🥺
😂😂😂 when Jeffery said YouTube fell off. He’s just self projecting cause he fell off of YouTube. 😂😂😂 People still watch YouTube, Babe. They just don’t watch you.
I feel the same way sometimes on my YouTube channel no one likes to watch
Lol, I thought he already quit. I honestly though he was going to sasell Jeffrey Star Cosmetics. So I was not shocked, I don’t think anyone was. I hope the rest of the video gets more interesting.
Awww I’m still here.
Wow... I can't imagine YouTube without Jeffree ☹
Jeffree seems so at peace, it warms my heart ♥
Shane looks like he wants to 🪦in this Hummer
All I ever watch is YT.  I don't have tictoc and I never plan on getting it.  YT is not dead.  This is like free TV made by normal people.  Much better than the crap they put out on TV.
The shot of Jeffrey and Maddie walking into the airport is everything 👌👌👌  I replayed it about 20 times
love youtube, but jeffree is right, there has been a shift in the viewers and  creators too. I belive this changes  have happened for many reasons, like jeffree said the streaming platform with high budget I belive is one, but also doing youtube is a job and ad revenues might be not great at the moment and this makes it also not worth it, especially at their level. Personally to be scrutinized so much I would need a good payback. i don’t think we viewer sometimes really grasp the tool that notoriety can have on ppl. Also many youtubers have left and some have changed their content way too much. I'm an "older" viewer and some creator just feel disingenuous and their content is just lacking quality, con u even call content if the video lacks of it? I'm saying this from a place of sadness bc I get that some creators  after being famous and getting criticism for every little thing, and scrutinized as one mistake or being flawed can turn u into terrible human being without any goodness in them and for that they have to "pay a price" like being cancelled ecetect; I think that being overcautious in opening themselves up again is a natural reaction, but of course content is affected. Shane I really love how you documentary, if it brings u joy I really  think (also wish) you should do them more often. I have loved them so much that I even watch the ones about pll i don’t care about and they are still the best. I can only imagine how hard must have been moving on from the last couple of years but you really have a talent for this, so waste too much time being scared bc there really are ppl that support you!
Jeffrees country event is everything yall
That last part made me so sad! I get where Jeffree comes from… YouTube beauty has been struggling a lot! I really just watch Jeffree the rest I go to tiktok! But I love the vlogging content here! I mean I still watch YouTube! Please don’t leave it 🫠🫠🫠 This second part was amazing! Loved seeing Jeffree being his funny self! I love you both together!
I hope you guys don't quit YouTube! I go to YouTube everyday
I still watch YouTube daily. Shane and Jeffree my faves so I’m sad to see him go I wish there was another platform since YouTube sucks so bad
I love you shane!!
I watch every single Jeffrey star video he posts!
Oh my God I love his house so down to earth 🖤 I love you guys together!!! I'm so happy although it's bittersweet!
I’d say like 90% of people in Texas don’t talk with “stupid Texas slang” either. I mean considering most people that live here aren’t even from here.
Honestly, I'm happy and proud for Jeffree. He TRULY seems happy and is doing something that is fulfilling. I think he enjoyed the big mansion, but it wasn't satisfying for him. Just a giant empty house that he was supposed to share with Nate, but then that didn't happen. Now he seems like his heart is full and he's doing something he loves. It's so wholesome. He really cares about the Yaks, both the pets and the livestock. It might upset some people, but he loves animals and they will have the best lives possible before it's time to go. He'll treat them with respect, which is more than most livestock get.
The damn gucci shoes part has me CRACKIN UP
Love you Shane!!❤🎉
I still have no idea what ya'll were "canceled" for. Cancel culture is stupid and I'm sorry ya'll had to go through it but sounds like you came out the other side even better. So I'm glad for that. It makes me sad Jeffree is quitting YouTube!! I watch it LOL
Wait. I still come to YouTube... but I'm also old...lol I'm happy to see that he is finally happy. Truly happy. Not just riding the social media wave happy, but genuinely content and happy in life. We watched him rise, struggle, come back, clap back, and struggle some more. It's about time he finds what makes his soul smile. Us old folk (lol) will miss him here, but we'll also follow him to TikTok, or wherever his journey takes him. 💕⭐️
Not hating on what Jeffree is saying but I do agree that YouTube is dying a TINY bit. But I feel like from what he’s saying about YouTube is kinda based on HIS YouTube career because he kinda needs to realize that not everyone watches makeup videos and yes it’s very common but there’s only so many people that do. Plus people change the type of stuff they like to watch like when I was younger people use to always watch Minecraft videos or craft/diy videos or maybe even prank videos, so maybe the types of videos people watch are different. But the main thing he has to realize is that he got “canceled” and that he doesn’t  have as many subscribers anymore so really YouTube isn’t really dying down as much as he’s saying it is.
I still watch
Bored
Jefree has been seriously shadow banned.  I never get notifications ever for his videos
I’m gonna cry , I don’t want Jeffrey to quit YouTube omg 😩😢😔
Omfg that was crazy!!
Don’t quit please you are my happiness 😭
Congratulations to you fir finding a new happy life! But I still love YouTube!! Tick Toc is just a bunch of old dudes dancing. Not my scene.
there only being old people in the airport in casper surrounding your colorful group is SENDING ME 💀💀💀
I hope we see the old squad too soon😔
I still watch YouTube for fun! But I agree that no one gets the same views as they used to. It’s quite sad.
Shane wearing Gucci is the best thing I've ever heard of in my whole life!😍❤I love shane so much he gets me threw the hardest parts of my life an I wish I could thank him an give him a big hug one day he's actually been like a huge role model for me he always felt like a dad to me lol I know it sounds crazy but it's true love you shane !😁❤💯
Hmm…YouTube is dead? This video got 260k views in a few hours. Thinking jeffree just thinks it’s dead cuz his videos don’t get as many views as they once did. I still watch YouTube all the time, but I do have to say that I watch a lot more of a variety than I did 1-3 years ago. Back then, I watched almost all makeup only. Now I watch so many genres.
I’m literally so sad that jeffree quitting YouTube but it’s not surprising he honestly quit two year ago If you think about it he literally only posted for his launches
Shane I love you don’t pull a Jeffrey
Wow I legit love  Jeffery and Shane’s  new , happy look on health.
THIS. IS. EVERYTHING. Loveeeeeeeeee!
Its sad to hear jeffree say that youtube is dead. I hope he knows that there are still people who watch him.
I literally heard when he said YouTube is dying out and said "oh wow that's so true!" cuz im busy watching discovery plus for $5! Happy with my 90 Day Fiancé seasons and Netflix series!😂 But ill always miss Jeffree Star, Fred, Jenna marbles, the OGs that started it all!
2 hours ago Shane It says 2 hours ago 214k views and 25k likes "OH COME ON Y'ALL HIT THAT THUMBS UP BUTTON!! JUST LIKE THE VIDEO!" Right now LOL 😉 Anyways Shane If you think people don't love them some Shane Dawson You are wrong! I love me a Shane Dawson Video Even when you were taking your little break because People got JEALOUS AF  from You and Jeffree Star breaking the internet So many people wanted that makeup and It sold so fast People got jealous So they went and had to find some dirt on you and put a stop to that lol Forced You right off the internet Girl You sold makeup so fast I think you could be put in record books of some kind #1 most sold in so many minutes NoBoDy WiLl EvEr BeAt ThAt WoRlD rEcOrD and You Scared some people out there LOL and I wouldn't doubt it If people didn't get paid secretly to find dirt on you, I don't know for sure But.... Shane so they can pull that stupid Cancel culture crap on you! #Nobody'sSafe so they could put a stop to you selling anymore makeup like you did? That is my theory about it and I bet I am right about it? LOL I think You Shane and Jeffree could make into the  Guinness World Records Book for the most makeup sold in so many minutes to the point that You actually broke the internet LOL Nobody will ever be able to do that again and They know it . Just people had to be the sheep they are and follow the flock and get you cancelled But All That Drama also mess it up for EVERYONE in the makeup world because after they got you cancelled The makeup video's just have not been the same and I've noticed I am not the only one that thinks this way too.... Just go watch other YouTube video's I've seen a couple and I was Glad to hear Jeffree say it too I was like Thank Goodness They know What happened But Y'all had to know someone was gonna get screwed and Of course It's not going to be the one with the most $$$ Butt anyways Shane Don't let anyone do that to you ever again Please We LOVE you and I know I do not want to not be able to watch a Good fun entertaining Shane Dawson video because You are one of the best out there and I wish you knew What I know Shane You are loved and should not look down on yourself so much because Shane Dawson You are In My opinion A living Legend when it comes to the YouTuber world Please Don't let anyone bring you down again Life is too short to worry so much about that stuff Let your freak flag fly Baby LOL Shane You are AMAZING!!
I like your relationship with Jeffree because he makes you so confident
You are the best at directing and creating amazing content ❤  where’s that Netflix special 👀😂 continue what you are doing!! Pls never stop
I honestly only come to YouTube for you! I count on your reviews, and I love your reveals! But it's honestly about what makes you happy 🖤
Finally, the real Jeffree. The way he communicates is even different. I love how peaceful he is. This is so awesome.
You all look good, it’s good to see the trouble makers back together… Who cares what anyone says, it’s easy for people to be keyboard warriors! Anyways y’all look so EFFIN GOOD…. Sending love ❤️ 😊
Shane can you please start making movies as your next adventure please.
Dang, not this literally turning into a docuseries about YouTube’s downfall 😅😢 I mean it’s true. The only videos I watch religiously now are yours.
Y’all should have jeffree to come to Colorado
I want the second pallet so bad dude
Watching Shane and Jeffree talk about the cancelled palette is actual torture. 😩😩😩
After 2 hours there are 200K views.  Is it dead?  Maybe resting for the moment.  Part of being cancelled is that people don't tune in, but there are reincarnations of everything.
Aw I hope Jefree keeps popping up in your videos we are going to miss him so much!
Something about this was really cringey
Jeffrey looks so different. I can’t put a finger on it but he just looks at peace, relaxed , and just so real ❤
You wish you would be 1% as missed as Jenna Marbles. This isn't an airport, Jeff..... you don't need to announce your departure!
When I heard Jeffree said he is gonna quit I got emotional 😭 it’s sad it’s true YouTube isn’t the same anymore as it was once before. Glad to see Shane and Jeffree back together but I wish Jeffree more happiness then sadness. Close one chapter and time to open another one. ✨♥️
hi umm jeffree can we get the snap goodmornings again thooo? lollll w the pups.
Honestly hope they release this pallet
YouTube is my "TV" and there are a lot of people that still watch it regularly.  I really wish the suits would leave some siht alone! (The date of the video's posting is gone (that's a really big p.o.); the count on the dislike/thumb down button, the stupid algorithm (for several reasons...).)
Ghost hunting with Jeffrey??? I’m in ❤❤❤
But we care!!! Please don’t go Jeffree!!! 😭😭😭
I've always admired Jeffrey. I have several of his palettes. But I was never really a huge fan because of the excess life he lived. Similar to a Kardashian. I understand why people would want to live that life, it's just not my vibe. This is a Jeffrey that I could watch. I'm glad he found peace.
I just finished and I’ve laughed so hard but also cried! Jeffree, I still watch your videos and I’m sad to see you to 😔
What ever happened to the guy Jeffree was dating?
I am loving this series! I always love your videos, and truly love how genuine your friendship with Jeffree is. You two are so comfortable with each other and your laughs are contagious. He will be missed from YouTube, but if it's what brings him happiness than all we can do as fans is support that decision. Love you all
Shane coming in strong with that cancer intuition/energy. Same boo, same.
It’s true what jeffree is saying about how people aren’t clicking on YouTube anymore to watch beauty videos , the beauty community is dead now and his views are going down everytime he post a new YouTube video.
Now I really want to drop the big city and move out to the country to find inner peace 🧘‍♀️🏞
He says YouTube sucks...right below I see 19.5 million subscribers for Shane's channel. ... we all have our niches
Omg I missed y’all together I love Jeffree he taught me how to do my makeup when I was learning and I remember when I turned 16 I had my first job and with my first pay check I bought the conspiracy pallet but I’m so happy to see Jeffree so happy
I mean he’s right YouTube is dead if your a beauty creator, gaming is like the top thing to watch
It's so sad to see YouTube lose a lot of audience. I even lost interest until recently, I realized I'm graduating in 2 years and I just want to rewind time a bit. Thank you for being some of my favorite content creators
Nooooo! That's the only way I watch him! I'm gonna cry 😭😭 please dont!
Jeffree looks so healthy and happy. He looks so comfortable with himself. I can’t put my finger on it but he looks genuinely happy. He also looks younger hehe good for him
Has anyone else ever gotten the vibe from the beginning that Jeffree does NOT like Ryland at all?? 😂😂
Noooooo 😭 Jeffree can’t leave YouTube. We DEFINITELY still watch and care.
jeffree seems so so happy it’s wonderful to see
Please tell jeffree we will miss him so much if he leaves! I’ve watched his videos for years and I love watching him create makeup looks and have fun! I know I don’t represent the majority but he needs to know how much I appreciate him and his videos!! He’s taught me everything I know about makeup, my best friend too. We bonded over his videos and have been best friends for 9 years! I know I’m just one person but please tell him that my best friend and I love him! I want him to do whatever will make him happy, but he needs to know that not everyone is gone, lots of us still love his videos! He deserves to know there are still people who are here and in his corner!
It’s really sad to hear that jeffree is quitting youtube. I dont think youtube is dead. There are so many platforms that are thriving. I think it is the beauty industry on youtube that is dying because they are moving to other platforms.
This comment section is so censored it’s insane
Okay but Chris asking "Can I pet a yak?" Might just be the cutest thing ever. <3
Aww, it was so sad watching your face drop when Jeffree said he was leaving YouTube. Everyone retires eventually but it must feel so surreal to still be making video content when you both essentially grew up on YouTube together. Can't wait to see where the series takes us.
Love your videos... you always crack me up!!!
I think what’s most beautiful about this video is the sincerity behind it. COVID ruined SO much, & life’s unexpected moments can take a toll on us BUT gives an opportunity to choose ourselves all over again. This is beautiful, Shane! I love you guys!
I still use both pallets all the time
Love it 😀
no please don't go Jeffrey
This is making me so happy and sad at the same time! ❤
I dunno, my youtube sub list is pretty consistently good every day. It helps when content evolves and matures with the viewers. I don't like the same stuff I did 10 years ago or even 5 years ago. If your sub list is boring, then your favorite creators grew up or got cancelled 😂 I dont think youtube is dead, people just don't settle for mediocre and stale. Longer, higher quality videos means less daily content sort of channels.
Chris, get a stabilizer for your camera ffs😂
i’m genuinely sad about jeffree quitting youtube.. i’m still one of those people that go to youtube after a long day at work and find something to watch.
Um... I'm on Yt 17 hours a day :/
🤢 Love this, but Chris could we please use a gimble??? The motion was sickening. Love you tho. For real. ❤️
❤❤❤❤
My heart hurts…
I think Jeffree looks so healthy now. I'm glad he's thriving now!
I missed them so much 😭😭😭
You two are perfect together. Xo
That ending though 😮
And here I am, watching YouTube all day at work 😢
Jeffree is clearly in such a more natural and relaxed state it's beautiful to see. I feel like this time around we're seeing the "off camera" normal side of Jeffree, it's so refreshing to see. I have to admit I'm guilty! I haven't watched a Jeffree video in a while and it's because as his "LA ⭐💲Lifestyle" & vlog videos have ended I've started to look elsewhere, and if this is the end for Jeffree on YouTube it's been great to see his normal self in such a great mental place before I see less of him.
If Shane ever stops videos I’ll lose it like literally cry I click on every Shane Dawson video even the ones from years ago
that one piece of hair sticking out of jeffree’s hair is driving me insane
I just want to echo every positive comment on this video , I love ❤️ your content 💕 and I love you and jeffrees beautiful relationship, I haven't even seen this palette and I know I want it so badly ❤️ massive love to you, your family & to jeffree motherfecken star 🌟🌟   I am absolutely stunned at jeffrees announcement but you have to do whats right for you at the end of that day *find your passion 🫶💕💕
Me using YouTube everyday
That shot of “ I haven’t changed “ lmfao
normalize ankle health
I was raised on youtube to the point that some of the creators just feel like family. It is sad to think of it coming to an end
The way he always says he's "scared" of ridiculous things.
I absolutely love this!! I'm cannot wait till next week episode!!
I live for Shane and Jeffree banter!!! Hilarious!!! ❤❤
Can’t wait until they reveal the secondary palette!! I wonder if Jeffree ever recycled the unused colors in his releases since then?
I still watch 😟. I almost exclusively watch YouTube. I hate TikTok. 😮‍💨
Jeffrey genuinely looks so good!
im not on tiktok just youtube ,, the end of this made me so sad!!!
Not my airport looking very similar and me wondering what LAs baggage claims look like
I love YouTube! I absolutely love to keep up with my favorite creators!! Shane please never stop! You keep my life interesting!!!
Jeffree looks so handsome. I wonder where he gets his nails done out there!!!
I mean... Of course, Jeffree isn't getting those views now that he's been cancelled. It has very little to do with streaming platforms. I know it looks like people are watching Youtube less and less, but it's only like that because SO many creators have either quit or been cancelled. Getting 1-2m views stings when you were used to being on top of the world. I understand that. But that's just how it is when you've been cancelled. But I can't explain why he's getting so many views on TikTok. That app is still an enigma to me.
Welcome back
I'm scared for the day you choose to do the same shane. I've been watching you since day 1. Even though you don't know me I feel a connection with you. When that day comes I fear it will feel like I'm losing my family. But I also hope that when that day comes you're doing it to make yourself happy. Because that's the way I'll imagine it.
This makes me so sad to hear jeffrey say he's done with youtube! 😢 I miss watching his makeup tutorials and watching you guys in this series gives me so much joy!
honestly i disagree with no one watches YouTube anymore sure there are other platforms that people will go on more but For alot of people youtube is home where will people go to for instant happines where will they go when they need to learn how to do something Youtube. hell some people need youtube to fall asleep at nigh. Jeffree still "cancelled' so ofc he doesnt get that much views in time
41:10 for the Blood Sugar Mini and Pink Religion pallets, there is no joy in Jeffree's eyes. It may be that his lashes are heavy, or the lights are bright, but to me he looks empty, no joy 😢💔 BUT NOW HE LOOKS SO FULL OF JOY AND WHOLESOME AND LIKE HE'S FOUND HIS PLACE AND HIM SELF 😁💕
Please don't leave, Jeffree!! And do long form content on TT... not just the short shit.  TT is so hammered in terms of censorship... I don't either of you to disappear... love you all x
COULD NOT CLICK FAST ENOUGH 🥰😘
Wow, just wow
There is something so heartbreaking about knowing that Jeffree doesn't read video comments and doesn't think we love the content because there aren't as many of us. I hope he can find another way to interact with fans as opposed to disappearing.
I do not watch Tic tock. I buy lots of J ⭐ stuff and would be so fucking sad if he quits
That ending made me sad! You guys are my adolescence and you don’t know me (yet) but I grew up with you guys! 😢  Glad Jeffree was finally able to grow up though and become who he was meant to be. I’m excited to experience the change
Gosh I have missed Jeffree Lynn!  During the last series with Jeffree I was pregnant with my miracle baby!  This just brings back so many good memories.  Now my baby is 3 and Jeffree Lynn is a fucking farmer!  I would have never guessed!  This new look is so good on him though.  ❤️ Also Shane I could watch your series forever!  I find myself upset when it ends.  I need more!  Now!
Can y’all like still release the palette lmao
That’s so sad! All I watch is YouTube! I am almost 40 and TikTok is not an option nor will it ever be. Boo
Not one negative comment. Interesting
Some of my favorite creators are starting to also leave YouTube and it genuinely makes me so sad since I still actively use YouTube as a main source of entertainment 🥺😭  Jeffrey seemed so much more at peace, I’m glad to see it, I’m so excited for the rest of this series! Y’all exploring haunted sites in Wyoming would be so cool to see!!
YouTube is still my go to before Netflix or anything else :( I really hope YouTube doesn’t fizzle out and YouTubers don’t leave permanently. This makes me so sad.
Can't wait for part 3!!
I missed you Shane. Super excited to watch this. ❤️
JEFFERY, we stopped watching YouTube because you stopped doing your videos, i lived for your videos, about your life, make up reviews that’s what we wanna see we don’t care about the fakeness😢😢 show us the new you, “ day in my life vlogs “ anything
This was amazing, I am so happy for Jeffree and pray for his continued peace and calm. It’s so deserved. Great job living your best life!!!!!!!!! ❤❤
THEY JOY BRINING MY BODY, MIND, SOUL THAT THE ARE BACK TOGETHERRRR
pls don leave Shane, I grew up w u lmao
Well, Jeffree has posted more then 2 videos on youtube since his wedding palette has come out lol. He just posted another one today promoting his new palette.
I really hate to see Jeffrey go! 😢But I totally understand if that’s what makes him happy! But tik toks are no where near the same as a YouTube video. I really hope Shane stays since he just got back!
I’m ready for the next part…what torture😢 . I LOVE YOUTUBE STILL❤
Jeffrees sink is glowing
Excuse me Jefree.... I haven't gone anywhere 🥺💔
Still watching the episode but I was wanting to ask you to make an iced coffee flame shirt for your merch line maybe with the pig on a sleeve ? I would buy like 20... love you.. I'm so excited to sit down and watch this
This makes me so happy hoping this is a long series!!!
I really hope you don’t follow suit and leave us too Shane. As someone who has watched both of you, for a very long time, I can honestly say that I would feel heartbroken to loose you both. Losing Jeffree is going to suck, but I understand that he wants to move on. I respect that. I don’t like it, but I respect it! lol
Gonna cry if Jeffrey really leaves youtube feels like my childhoods dying
Im confused by jeffree saying no one watches YouTube anymore so I went and looked at his views and he has 2-5 mil views each video so idk what he's talking about? Maybe he means makeup just isn't "in" anymore, true crime and commentary And podcasts have taken over the landscape, IMO of course. But YouTube isn't dead at all, the beauty community is. Look @ bailey Sarians views. People are still watching.
Jeffree seems too chill… like it’s crazy. I love him forever, of course but I think he’s wrong about YouTube being dead…
Him last episode blurring the name of that pallet, and then accidentally slips it! I knew it would be called Cancelled. Im living for it.
We 💛 you Shane and Jeffree. Also hi Chris how are ya?
Jeffrey looks soooooo good!!
I grew up in Wyoming and it’s cool to see people loving it and not being like uhhh that state doesn’t exist! Lol
Watching Jeffree say no one cares about YouTube anymore 🥺 we still here boo, the real ones
Why did he change the title? It used to be “The retirement of Jeffrey Star” with the thumbnail of jeffree with no makeup crying😅
It hurts my heart that Jeffree is saying that about YouTube because I love YouTube lmao. I hate tiktok but I have to respect it. They have to go where is making them money. It's a career
Youtube is still alive and well. I see it day to day, it's a huge base for people. It might be for him because he is over it for him, but he isn't everyone so. Good for him though for changing and starting a new life for himself. I never really followed him.
The people that recorded you shane and call you fat will go to hell... love u shane please stay safe and strong
I still watch you tube cause I don’t like tik tok at all
Am so glad u guys are back together . It’s good to see y’all doing well . Also outfit change at the airport … genius !
Jeffree do what makes you happy, but you will be missed. Shane thank you for making these videos I have been a viewer of yours since 2009.
CANCELLED PALETTE IS MY DREAM
I’m loving video ❤😂
Im a nobody but i still enjoy YouTube, i love all u guys..i listen to you while im driving or cleaning my house and it feels like im actually hanging out with friends.
I've been with Shane and watching Shane for over 10 years. Sure, I do believe YouTube will die out, but I hope he never stops making content.
Keep it up sweetie  We love you💓
I love Jeffree and Shane. Youtube will never be the same without you as a content creator.
ugh thinking of my favourite youtubers thinking about quitting youtube makes me sick. i watch youtube everyday, i can't remember when i actually watched tv and i wish youtubers felt the same way i do about youtube and want to post.
I love and vibe with new down to earth jeffree
Really sad jeffree is leaving youtube I have always watched n always will
I still watch YouTube for entertainment
I watch other things on YouTube just not beauty content anymore. That community is not the same for sure .
this series is everything x
I mean. I do agree with Jeffree. Many YouTubers I watch used to get millions of views within 24hrs. Now they’re lucky if they hit 500k-1m by the end of the month.
Fuck this lmao. I'm here on YouTube every dayyyyyyy
I always watch and always care but I understand how toxic it's been for him. It isn't shocking to me because it's been a couple years since he posted on any regular basis. I do believe more would warch if it wasnt just a release video almost every time but I 100% understand his decision - if there is no joy, move on.
18:45 I am obsessed with this jeffree. Living his life with the tailgating in electric hummer 😂
I literally almost cried when Jeffrey said he was going to quit. He made me love makeup and put me in the path of my career. I really can’t …..
I feel kinda like a loser cuz I watch YouTube more than anything else lol I look forward to every video you and all my other favorites make. I’m still finding new people I like watching all the time. Like I love tv and movies but you tube does give this extra special connection I don’t feel from all the other medias. I love you all 🖤💕✨
This video gave me all mixed feelings. It was times I was smiling & laughing then I went to frowning & sad when JS said that about Youtube😢 I’m still on here daily watching everyone I support. Ugh 😣 everyone’s leaving 😭😭
Can’t wait for the next part!! That ending 😳😳
This is my favorite Jeffree
Jeffree 😢
I want to know jeffree stars secret to his success
Honestly, I found it sad how empty youtube has become. I grew up with this platform and I still to this day love youtube and come here for comfort. I do understand where Jeff. was coming from and how he thought his time had come to an end for youtube.   I want to add that this video made me very happy, not only seeing Shane and Jeff. together but seeing that they were both able to grow, learn, and change from the past and become happier versions of themselves. I am so happy for Jeff. and his ability to ground himself and connect with nature/animals. Love this series, can't wait for more :)
4:20 putting your phone like that is a crime omfg
I was not expecting Jeffree to pull out a gun in the hummer like that! 😂
I think Youtube died out for the exact reasons Jeffree named, he did it ALL and now people wanna see everyday life stuff. I LOVE daily vlogs and more lowkey stuff. I think in the pandemic, no one wanted to see people living lavish while they struggled either financially or emotionally. Youtube isn't dead but the high-risk, intense, over-the-top video demand went down.
WOW I haven’t been  this shocked in forever!!
Wait but if there is a second palette, can it literally be called the Cancelled Palette
Honestly, I can understand where Jefferee is coming from. He is a business person and he thrives on that part of creating something but Shane is all about YouTube because that's his passion. I think Shane and Jefferee need to keep doing videos together because they make a perfect match when it comes to creating things but letting Jefferee step away from all the YouTube stuff may be great for him. I would love to see them both ghost hunting lol
The silencer on the gun is a little much.. is he a secret hit man?
If Jeffrey is right, and I genuinely hope he isn’t, my heart will be broken. I feel grief at the thought of it. I truly enjoy YouTube.  I hope the excellent creators won’t hear this and bail because that will certainly be the end. 🤷🏼‍♀️
not me making a drinking game out of shots everytime shane says " we will talk about it later "
Literally watching this at 2x speed and tapping through to get to the part about why this two part “series” came out in the first place…. Oh you’re just trying to make more money for your pallet. Lol. Got it.
Shane I would love if you would pass a message on to Jeffery I’m glad he found his true happiness it’s not always material things that bring you true happiness I’m just glad he’s happy I love ❤️ him so much I wish I had his makeup skills he’s amazing at 66 I still don’t have a clue lol I hope you guys don’t think on retiring because then fuck YouTube nothing worth watching anyway take care of Jeffrey give him a hug and a kiss for me I wish him the best and all that he does I don’t have TikTok It breaks my heart to think we won’t see him again so that means you and Ryland have to go see him more OK guys love you to the moon and back don’t forget to get my love to Jeffrey Jacky from Montreal
i love youtube its juist noone cares about makeup
I hate all the stupid faces Shane makes like come on…
my biggest question after this is how Jeffree gets weed in wyoming. its super illegal there.
Didn’t realize how much I needed this. 🖤
I agree with Jeffrey. YouTube isn't what it use to be.
The fact that im gonna lose all of my favourite youtubers is a sad reality of the imminent fact that im aging 💔
the day shane leaves youtube is the day i delete this app.
It’s time to get right with Jesus! You aren’t going to automatically enter heaven if you’ve lied or stolen or had sex before marriage, don’t be deceived! The punishment of sin is Hell fire and we are all guilty of sin. We are guilty before God and need forgiveness. Call upon the name of Jesus and follow him. Pray and ask him to help you repent of your sins! He died so you could have everlasting life with your sins dealt with justly. He bore the punishment. You must know him today! You may not have another day.
😮
Damn! I have to keep turning the volume up and down on this video and the last, the volume/sound mixing isn't there
😳 What is going on!? Is this the Twilight Zone?
We didn’t need this ❤️
I'm here for my BUFFY discount hehehe
Omg i still love youtube 😭💜 jefree imma cry
I hate to agree with Jeffree, but it’s true. I used to come to this app and spends hours watching content over watching TV. I feel like everything changed when Jenna left, then Shane stop posting, I can’t even name all of the others I used to watch that are gone now. It’s truly lost it’s sparkle and it’s sad.
Even if no one watches do it because you enjoy it! I love YouTube I spend all day when I’m free watching YouTube videos:( it’s my escape. So many other people feel the same we all still care youtube kids 2013 yourube lovers still love it now xx
I get what Jeffree is saying… BUT I think it’s more that there’s a shift into different neiches of Youtube than there was a couple years ago. Yes, beauty has made a HUGE shift to Tik Tok, and there’s new faces in that beauty world… but honestly, we still have our favorite youtubers that we watch on YT first over any streaming app, Shane being #1!
No jeffrey... no one is clicking on YOU anymore...
When those gates opened I thought...you can put the star 🌟 in the middle of nowhere....but no doubt it still shines!
Cryingg 💔
People believing that Jeffrey Star has Yaks and doesn’t kill them and eat them is HILARIOUS!
I literally cannot believe that Jeffree is deciding to quit indefinitely.. the OG yters are quitting one by one; Jenna and now Jeffree, but it's true that YouTube is slowly fading out of popularity. I don't blame them, it's just not the same and it's too problematic. i rlly hope Jeffree all the best with his life. Thanks Shane and Jeffrey for these iconic series <3
Why is Shane not “freaking out” when Jeffree is chewing on cheez it’s?? 🤔
Shane you best never ever quit:(
I still get on YouTube every day... Several times a day... But he's right... No one is making content and there isn't anything to watch anymore 😔
I like that Volcano in the basement!
I hate going on social media because it’s so pointless and depressing. That’s why I love going on YouTube, it’s honestly so relaxing watching my favorite YouTubers 🥹 just like rylans because It’s so comfortable to watch just like Morgan she’s so real and funny ❤ I rather watch YouTube than be on TikTok scrolling for hours and feeling insecure tbh
I’m so confused…everyone I know around my age watches YouTube….even a good chunk of older people I know too. YouTube is dead??? Are you fr??
SLAY SHANE🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
wait.. that is shocking what ??????
I have been a small business owner since the age of 23. I honestly wouldn’t have had the strength to keep going a lot of times if it weren’t for the original series you two did together. I’ve had some of the darkest days of my life in the last three years, becoming a single mom during the pandemic, having to sell my house to survive. It’s been rough, and still is. I always find myself circling back to 2 things to reignite my passion, the book “you’re a badass at making money” and the conspiracy pallet series. I hope you guys really know the good energy you have put out into the universe for a lot of us. ❤ *edited to add I’m 33 now lol)
“I like traveling just not with Elton John” HAHAHAHA
It’s sad cause it’s true yet I come home and still watch YouTube
Not really suprised Jeffree has said for a long time he's been board and he has a point that all the action is on tik tok.
I’ll be sad to see Jeffree stop but I understand it. If quitting YouTube brings him happiness I rather have him happy than miserable. To be honest though YouTube isn’t notifying me when he posts. I have notifications on but I don’t get them. I just checked his channel and I missed 5 videos.
Jeffree saying that no one watches his channel anymore and that no one watches Youtube anymore made me sad because that's not true. It may be a lot less people than before, but the true fans are still here
your skin looks SO good!! if i’m honest i havent really watched any of your recent videos so this could be old news but your skin is literally glowing!
The nostalgia I feel watching this series is undescribable, I love you both so much and will always be a huge fan :)
💞💋🤗
I hope Youtube never dies. I love watching it, its pretty much the only thing I watch. Please dont stop making content!
I'm shocked to hear that Jeffree is quitting youtube. It also makes me so sad that he said no one is watching anymore. I get on YouTube every day and watch my subscriptions. I love watching new videos that they all put out! People are still interested, but it's hard to notice the ones that lurk I guess. I'm one of those... I don't normally comment, but I'll watch and like videos.
lmao Jeffree claiming no one watches youtube anymore… sis no one watches *you* anymore hahah we’re out here watching other people
Why was the caption changed?
Me: watches exclusively YouTube all day 😂
Literally smoking out of my volcano 🌋 and seeing Jeffery’s there at the table 🖤 high twins 💚
This is really cool.  He seems so much more happy, he learned a lot from the rural people of Wyoming.
This honestly broke my heart. I still come on here to see the both of you, but I do want him to be happy at the end of the day. I will always be a fan no matter what. ❤
Bro make different content PLEASE 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
him saying its time to hang up the button literally made me emotional bc this was my all of my childhood☹️
I’m happy Jeffree is happy, but selfishly I hope he doesn’t quit YouTube, I always watch all of his new videos and I can’t imagine not seeing him at all anymore on here🥺 don’t leave us Jeffree!!!❤️
I miss Jenna marbles too 😩 but he have to do watch makes you happy not what makes you unhappy 🥰
To be honest I lowkey disagree with Jeffery cause ill still be on youtube watching videos and sh*t.
This video made me nostalgic, I’m so happy to see you guys happy and together again 💗
I always get sad when I realize the videos over, and these comments always make me happy cry 🥰  Love to see you loving things again Shane
Them laughing together brings back great memories
…..I still watch YouTube. lol
We want the 2nd pallet!!!
I watch YouTube more than other media sites. I rather learn something or enjoy makeup videos   Awww jeffree we are gonna miss you!
I think these content creators need to realize people want to see real life & relatable content! All the glitz and glam of social media is going away. People want to see people being their authentic selves, the good and the bad. it’s really sad to see a lot of the OG YouTubers all quitting 😢
God!! Jeffree seems to be happy, truly happy. He worked his ass off and made the money. He is now in a place of actually living a life that we are all meant to have, contentment and comfort in who he is. Material things yes are nice but he has traded them for a soul. Nothing more valuable than that. BRAVO Jeffree and Shane
They better release this pallette though....I already want it.
I'm still watching YouTube!  I prefer longer content.
What he said about the pandemic was so sad because it’s true. But it’s become such a bad thing because our attention span is becoming so short because of TikTok. We used to watch a 15 minute video and that was a treat! Now a 2 minute TikTok is to long. And that’s kinda scary for our future. 😢
I don’t think YouTube is dead… It’s all everyone I know watches or listens too.
funny how youtube is great untill your the ones being called out, then it "sucks" and noone watches it
As soon as Shane saw Jeffree, I wanted to CRY. I am in my FEELS!!!! <3
👁️👁️ the way the thumbnail and title changed right before my eyes from “ the retirement of Jeffree star “ to “ the new life of jeffree star”
Literally the only thing I watch on YouTube is Shane and Ryland other than that I use other social media to keep up with creators and watch content 🤷🏻‍♀️ rarely check YouTube unless I see that they post a new video is up on Insta.
these past two hours.. and nothing has happened
Ummm, I’m not no one.
It breaks my heart to hear That he is leaving YouTube🥲🥲I miss the old YouTube!! I come on this app everyday and watch the old Shane video and Ryland videos..  I will say seeing how happy Jeffree is so amazing!! Gosh I just hate that LA is so evil!!
I know what Jeffree means, I watch TikTok way more than YouTube, but I still go on to watch my favorites.
Ryland blocking everyone is a vibe.
The only Buffy I care about is Buffy Summers, and I hope all the make up video makers leave YT
I need the Jeffree star Shane Dawson, 2 part  palette
The thing about Jeffrey Starr is no matter what he’s doing he’s going to rise to the top. Love this new chapter for him.
Oh, ok...Jeffree looks like such a stud with those eyebrows and baseball hat!
Jeffree saying no one watches YouTube anymore is sooo wrong.
i watch youtube every day
If Jeffree stops YouTube I will cry.
13:41 omg i remember that it fucking scared me back then😂
Totally get that not getting the same numbers and having the same success on videos is disheartening. And it makes sense as a career move to move away from it, but I swear to God shane if I lose you, ryland, and Jenna I just won't make it lol
YouTube isn’t dead… I still watch videos everyday 😅
Out of all the times Jeffree has said he “changed”. This is the first time I believe him. It does feel different this time. ❤
Love this era of YouTube!
Everyone is so focused on Jeffree leaving YouTube that they didn’t pay attention to 42:42 when Jeffree says they are releasing Conspiracy 2 this month!!!!!!
Did the title change, or am I losing it? No hate. It came threw and I was busy, so left it as a notification,  and then when I clicked it was different.  Glad Shane is back. People learn, and grow as they get older. And anyone throwing stones isn't looking in the mirror. I promise they're not perfect either.
Lol & I was just thinking Jeffree should make more self makeup tutorial videos 😬 if he quits then I hope to see him make available stores of his own or something even if it’s for fashion/jewelry 🤷🏼‍♀️
Jeffrey and Shane being together makes me watch YouTube
Please never stop making videos shane. Jeffree I also still enjoy your videos!
Love this. I’m going to arriving to Denver in 2 weeks I’m so excited I love it out there!
The fact that Jeffree feels like no one cares and watches YouTube anymore… I literally watch YouTube each and every single day! And was just watching Jeffrees old videos last night!!! I don’t understand just because the numbers aren’t huge anymore doesn’t meant people don’t care. I hate tik tok. Mind you I’m the same age as Jeffree and Shane. I just can’t get into tik tok. I’ll forever watch YouTube.
YouTube has been my escape for over like 14 years now and always will be cause I’m lucky to still have people/content to watch who aren’t drama or any bullshit but Jeffree is right YouTube as whole sucks ass now. I’ll be sad to not see him in my feed anymore but I want him to be happy and move on. Even through all the bullshit I am glad to see you and Jeffree as better people in a better place just doing your thing. ♥️
jefree and shane saved me and made me realize that my brain lies and all the shit ive been through does not define me. im dead at that he said no one cares
This video just made me feel old lol
I love YouTube so it hurts to hear that I watch YouTube every day :/ but it makes sense
😢😢😢😢😢 I’m so sad jeffree states he will no longer want to do YouTube, but it makes me happy to see him just happy and enjoying life ❤
I love how "in tune" Jeffree is with the "climate" he is very sensitive and always 2 steps ahead. definitely an impath. I know youtube is exhausting but even at your "low views" is still higher than most. Please reconsider leaving totally.
Nobody says you have to stay gone forever, many greats say hi from time to time. There are different forms of videography. Personally, I enjoy learning about Jeffree’s entrepreneur skills and plans. Either way, do what is right for you.
No one can beat shane and Jeffrey's being so sassy and good together. Love you both. 💕
I love watching this serie so far. I Loved your other series also. You and Jeffree are so great together ❤️.  Much love from the Netherlands
Not the gun outside the airport lol😂 y’all crack me up!!!! Conspiracy segment on the Denver airport tea!!!!
Don't worry shane I to am afraid of flying
It makes me sad to see my favorite people slowly leaving YouTube and channels dying out but on one hand I want to see them live there lives and if they don’t wanna do YouTube I don’t wanna be the person that tell them to stay bc it makes me happy. I know YouTube is dying out but I love it with all my heart YouTubers raised me when I was in a abusive home and I can’t ever thank the people that helped me. But they did. Thank you Jeffrey and Shane you two have been my ride or dies for years. ❤
I watch Jeffree star ⭐️ I was wondering where she went .. I love the away she does her makeup 💄. She the Queen 🫅🫶🫶🫶🫶 or my Queen 🫅 of makeup 💄.. Sorry is I got her name wrong..
Make a video where u make jealous haters more jealous by even existing.
I still watch You Tube
SHANE PLEASE DONT STOP MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS!!!!
Shane your not wasting your time making these videos sure there are a lot of people who have lost there love for YouTube but the people who still r here, this is what makes us happy. All I do is rewatch old videos of you, ryland, and Jeffery and so many other channels and I can’t imagine coming home one day from school not being able to watch new videos of the people I look forward to watching on this platform everyday. It’s sad I look forward to new content and it doesn’t come out as fast as it used to. I mean last year when you guys did Vlog mess and said you were only doing like once a week or twice it made me sad because ik you guys take your time and make these videos for us but I was looking forward to an every day video of my favorite YouTubers. You guys said we would get tired of seeing you guys every day but no, that’s not true I enjoy every single bit of contact you guys make❤
Great series Shane! So sad to hear Jeffree is leaving you tube, I still watch the tube. I will miss seeing you Jeffree!
I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt this warm inside, thank you Shane!
Noooo Jeffree🤯
I paused the video to go vote come back and the name is changed lmao
Love you shane. Love you too together. Keep it up.
People are over the staged videos. I bet if he vlogged ranch life people would watch!
jeffree looks so much happier
😭Jeffree the ppl who REALLY care about u are the 1's watching, that's how we keep a relationship w u🥺😢😭💔
the thought of you or jeffree quitting makes me sick to my stomach i have been watching you both sense i was in elementary school and now im a 21 year old I grew up with you guys and love you both so much
I loved this video so fucking much but to Shane and to Ryland who continue to make content on YouTube. I am there almost immediately after a video is released! Your content gives me so much joy and you both are so inspirational. I absolutely understand why Jeffree is done with YouTube, however I want you two to know there is absolutely a fan base here for you both. Much love guys❤️
Did anyone else see the retirement of Jeffrey
I'm so sad rn and like Jeffrey is quitting YouTube like what....... 😶😶Bruh- I'm done (눈‸눈)
I am still watching YouTube everyday  I'm sad I'm definitely not for the tic toc brand!
who else teared up? ive grown with Jeffree since warped tour music days 😢
I think this is the start to the end of an era on YouTube :(
I love rylands honesty. Did you sew it lol 😆 also same shirt. That was iconic.
I don't have Tiktok, Netlix or Disney channel. I just still love watching YouTube.
I still watch YouTube daily!!!!! It’s all I watch!
You can feel the growth through this video. I’m like a proud daughter rn. Been here for over 10 years and I love who you’ve become. Hearing Jeffree wants to leave breaks my heart. 😭💗
Love you shane 💕
This feels so natural. Just some friends being relaxed & having genuine happiness. ♥️
It's not true nobody watches youtube anymore. People are not watching Jeffree anymore because of all of his scandals and because makeup videos are not as popular as they used to be. It is true that youtubers are not getting as many views are before but they are still so many people that get on youtube at least once a day. Everyday there are still new people coming to youtube that start making videos on this platform, grow their channels and make a living from youtube. So yes, people are still watching youtube.
I’m loving the Jeffery that is at complete peace and happiness! I’ll miss his videos tho! Soo happy you guys are both at great places in your lives and doing what makes you happy
We love this new jeffree  😍 he's grown so much! He thinks about everything and is super smart. Also his yaks are super cute 😍 he should do an eyeshadow palette after his yaks based on their coats
I don’t think doing YouTube is a waste of time. It is still my platform to unwind and keep up to date with my favourite YouTubers such as you. If for Jeffree it’s the right thing to do then that’s fine but, people are still out here supporting and watching and loving every moment!
Shane: This is going to seem so staged. I just wanted to make a stupid video..  Ten minutes later Shane: When I called Jeffree LAST NIGHT and asked if he was really wanted us to come  🙄🙄🙄
Thank god I watch a lot of car guys 😂😂 I hope Shane doesn’t leave yt soon
This is such a beautiful and nostalgic series, and it’s Christmas time! Thank you for doing this, even though it might have been hard!  🎄❤️
Jeffree  in this series is so different like he seems so real like as if I just saw the real him if that makes sense and I love it. ❤️
Wish this wasn't true ! My whole life has been YouTube and all the thing that I have learned from this platform helped me get thought so much shit. Shane your next videos should be on Jenna marbles. I think we all need a final goodbye.
Also shoutout to shane for not letting any cancelation stop you from doing what you love. I know its probably scary putting these out but look you're freaking trending AGAIN. YOU ARE MADE FOR THIS, DONT LET ANYONE STOP YOUR SHINE. Whoever doesn't like it, don't watch period.
YouTube is a large part of my life... Are sad as that sounds, but I love listening to videos while I work
Omg the end was so sad 😢 I get it…
Ok but youtube is still my main form of entertainment. I don’t even use tik tok. People 30+ like me don’t plan on eve using tik tok. There are booming communities on youtube including farming channels. Leaving longer form social media for instant gratification time suck tik tok is not the move I’d make. Tik tok is for teens. That’s what kids and teens do - endlessly scroll tik tok and instagram. It’s a financial move, not a passion move.
Ok I was so happy at the end of the last video but this one broke my heart. I can understand Jeffree's reason for wanting to leave YouTube.  The beauty community is pretty much dead on here. And that's coming from a Jeffree STAN. I'm overjoyed with how happy Jeffree's new life in Wyoming and his tiktok and insta stories make him... BUT Shane and Ryland don't you DARE leave us. YOUR CONTENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS PLATFORM ARE SO DIFFERENT AND COULD NEVER BE TRANSLATED TO TIKTOK! You're content is important and needed and there are still MILLIONS of people who sit down and watch your videos and look forward to them and that's still something! Don't leave us.  We STILL need you 💔
I’m sat here bawling 😭 because it’s not just about Jeffree leaving YouTube, It’s the memories attached to watching his videos at the time and how things have changed for me personally in life and for us all. It’s a reminder of that nostalgia. I didn’t think we could be nostalgic about just a few years ago but here we are😓😓  I don’t agree that YouTube is dead. I just think for some reason he flopped… probably bc of his breakup and then the pandemic and his cancellation 😭😭😭
I appreciate the series and I’m so glad he’s back to making videos. But I don’t believe a word he’s saying about this not being planned
If he doesn't enjoy doing YouTube anymore than he should stop. Plenty of us still watch, but from what I understand is the beauty community has changed, so maybe his side of YouTube is what he feels is dead. Tiktok is big now, but if that ban comes down in the US, YouTube shorts is where it'll shift to. Excited to see the next video! Love seeing jeffrees makeup products- I've never been able to justify dropping that much money on makeup but am still always tempted to buy some of his pallets!
The chemistry + friendship Shane and Jeffree have is unreal, both of them are so funny and I just love seeing them together ❤️
Culture is moving in a direction I don’t quite like. I do believe that tiktok will lead to the death of culture and I’m not even saying that we need these YouTubers back but you have to admit, at least this era of YouTube had authenticity that these new influencers don’t.
My heart Stopped!!! I love watching you 2 interact sooo much! He has to at least agree to do YouTube specials with you! Adventures with Shane!!! Great job on this series ❤️🙏😊
A star yak burger??? Tf 🤣
YouTube is what keeps me alive im 26 started at 10 its my life so I completely disagree id watch always
i cackled at the random clip of downtown athens georgia !!?? LOL
PLEASE TELL Jeffrey THAT IS so not true what he said about YouTube….. I am going to miss him so much. I love all of you so much. All of you have helped me in was that know one else could. I have been living in and of Hospitals science I was 18 years old and I am 36years old now. I have really bad health I have Crohn’s disease and have a lot of Help issues with my kidneys I’ve gone into kidney failure three times and then up with a tube in my back but they got now it’s been gone they taking it out a tooth that is. I also have had 40+ Surgeries. So I have been watching All of your guy’s videos when I was in the hospital and when I am home. They really help me for get about what is going on with me and help me for get about the pain that I have to live with on a daily.  I just wanted to share this with you all. Because you all matter so much to me through out all the years and I love and care about you all so much. Unfortunately I. Have not been able to afford any of your amazing Products that you have made and they are absolutely lovely too. I am not able to work because of my Health and my amazing husband has a job and he tries his best to take care of me and our three kids so I am very lucky to have him.  Life is so hard on us sometimes. But we all just need to be there for each other. This was hard for me to share but I just wanted to let you all know you matter so much too me….. I don’t know if you all will read this but I really hope you do.
I love you so much Shane ! Thank you for doing this for us . 💗💗💗
What Jeffree said about YouTube is so true. I don't watch YouTube "for fun" anymore like I used to, now I mostly watch Twitch when I want to watch something. I literally only use YouTube now for workout videos or to watch Shane of course 😆
This deserves more views, Shane!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jeffree saying “YouTube sucks, no one’s watching” while Shane is filming a YouTube series was just classic Jeffree 😂 but I’m sad he’s leaving this app. I’ve never left, I’m still watching you guys, and will continue to do so! 🖤
i’m so glad jeffree is doing what makes him happy. like he’s just being where he needs to be in this moment.
The montage of pallets 💀💀💀
I understand jeffrees decision to stop youtube, it's a lot of work to make content and if there's no passion behind it it will feel like just another chore, especially for someone like him that has soo much going on. He needs to be smart and focus on what will benefit his businesses. However, I really hope every few years they come together and make series like this because it brings me so much joy to see them, they have so much fun together and it just feels nostalgic at this point. Thanks shane for doing this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
is this creep still trying to come back??
To be fair I did unsubscribe from Jeffree a long time ago. His wealth got annoying to me and I got sick of that. But I watch YouTube everyday. I refuse to to install TikTok.
Jeffree giving Shane a Gun Safety lesson was the surreal content I signed up for
YOUTUBE SUCKS ! 💀
I would love to see some donkeys or mules out in the pasture! My brother has a hobby farm with so many different animals and it’s so cute to see a calf play with a baby goat or lamb. They all stay in the same pasture and get along great.
Anyone know the song at the end please?
wait, I'd be so sad if Jeffree quit....
It's a bitter-sweet feeling hearing Jeffree saying he might stop doing youtube videos or quit. When I'm starting to learn how to put makeup Jeffree videos are my go-to even until now. He helped, inspired, and motivated me. But now seeing how calm, and relaxed, and you can sense his having contentment and peace of mind right now, I'm very happy. Thank Shan for making this series again I love you both.
It is so nice to see Jeffrey so happy and grounded. I am so happy to see you all together ❤❤ I can't wait for the 3rd video.
Jeffrey has a point the only reason YouTube is still on my phone is because sometimes Shane uploads
I still go on youtube daily. I watch it more than any streaming service I have. Im sad jeffree is leaving but I understand she's a different person now. Hopefully you dont end up leaving too.
was it called the retirement of jeffree star a few hours ago or am I tripping lol looking for a friend lol
this video.. was so emotional. so many feels. I get Jeffree's decision and i get where they are coming from but, Shane please please never quit YouTube. we need you for real!
I was thinking when I was watching the first one that I love seeing shame do anything but I would really like to see him do a haunted series again and then Jeffrey said it during the second video
The background music during the talking parts is WAYYY too loud
“To be continued”….    “on HBO MAX”
and you guys❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does that mean the video he just posted is the last??
I still care about YouTube 😢❤❤❤❤❤love
I'm so glad to see you two back together... it makes my heart happy. You've always been two of my faves - no matter what the "cancel culture" has tried to do. I'm so tired of that sh*t.  People evolve. They grow. You both are relevant and always will be to me. Thank you for being who you are and living your best lives. Much love ❤️
Hi 👋🏻
I’m really liking this new Jeffree. So down to earth, and no longer very materialistic. Also, would definitely love to see you guys do a short paranormal series. That would definitely be exciting!
WTF JEFFREE!!!
I literally only watch YouTube.
Was this titled something different at first? I could have sworn it said something else
Literally living for Jeffrees house! Wow!!!!
The only bad idea jeffree has ever made is to leave Youtube
“Giving off all of those emissions with those private jets, we’re going green now b!+*h” 😭😭 Im so happy to see them all reunite 🤍
WE NEED THE SHANE 2 PALLET
Noooooooo! I loveYouTube! I don't use tik tok! I am sad to see Jefree go.
All I watch is youtube most of the time.. Same with my 15 year old 🤷🏻
We will miss you queen 💗⭐️
All the ads every two seconds really killed this app. I used to love YouTube and watch it everyday but the ads have just gotten so bad I don't watch it as much
I almost thought you were going into hyper drive in your Hummer!
I really enjoyed this. Jeffrees vibe is so different. He seems way more at peace. It’s so beautiful to see.  Also, I really hope this doesn’t influence Shane to leave. I love Shane.
I don’t think YouTube is dead, I think the type of content Jeffree was making just isn’t working anymore. And if he was doing it for the clicks and likes and not for himself, it makes sense for him to quit.
Oh how much I missed Jeffery and Shane together ❤️
IM SO HAPPY YALL ARE BACK
How can Jeffery say no ones watching, when his 5th recent vid got a MILLION views and the one before that even more. It comes off ungrateful to his real fans who enjoy his content
YouTube is dead because the best creators don’t create anyone 😢am so sad Jeffery is leaving . I still love YouTube
Ghost hunting series/paranormal PLEASE
I loved this. Thank you Shane.
Why did the name change? Didn’t it say something about jeffree was retiring ??
Breaks my heart to think of YouTube without Jeffree he literally is what I look forward to along with Shane and ryland content.
The end really did hit home so sad.
Why does Jstar look like ashton Kutcher like alot to me. living for it!
I'm so sad now. Love Jeffree content. Wish he would at least hire someone to film and edit him sometimes for the ones who do love to watch him.😭
36:31 Hotness 😍😍
listen i love jeffree and shane. like they are twin flames. they compliment eachother so well ❤
After all this....still love jeffree. Love himmmmmm
Den airport conspiracies 👀
Cringe at how Jeffree was trying to show off for Chris lol
I’m not someone who scrolls endlessly through TikTok and IG… YouTube has always been my favorite.  Makes me so sad that Jeffree wants to quit, but I respect his decision- he will be missed! 🙁
I watch YouTube all the time but the videos I miss most are Jeffree Star Approved videos.
I’m so excited this series is back❤
You will need to show Jeffrey how many views his getting now lol
I hope this doesn't inspire Shane to quite aswell. 😕
These videos is happiness, YouTube is happiness. Please don’t quit YouTube. Both Jeffree and Shane are loved and still so many of us watch your videos. Those videos help give us joy
The ad is relatable .. excessive sweating really has taken a lot of time in my relationship 😅
“We’ve gone green now!” And also the they/them comment god I love him so freakin much
I love that you’re getting sponsored
TikTok sucks!!
I understand where Jeffree is coming from, but I literally only watch Shane, Jeffree, Ryland, and Morgan on YouTube. If he does leave YouTube he will definitely be missed to his loyal followers. 💜
This was not long enough and idk how you're gonna make it 3 episodes when I have SO many questions Shane!
Jeffree says no one watches youtube anymore yet he still pulls in well over a million views per video, granted its not as many as he used to get but its still a lot. Maybe his channel just needs to go in a new/different direction
wait the psychedelic circus palette is 21 shades too lol. like the lay out you showed am i trippin or? lol.
Oh shit!
They should name the palette cancelled. Because they were cancelled the palette literally was
Shook.
Uhm Rylands hairstyle is fire right now. I love that cut and length on him.
I get it-Jeffree does not need you tube and hes grown and moved on, but I sure hope he is wrong and you tube is not over.....though I kind of feel like hes 100% right. Jeffree did not become a brilliant business man not being fully aware of the business at hand. So whats next, will Shane be making a Netflix series-I sure hope there is another platform for the genius that Shane brings IF youtube is fading. I know it seems silly but Ive learned a lot just learning about others and their lives----anyway, GREAT SERIES per usual and I have loved watching this as I have all Shanes projects. BTW Rylands outfits, God Damn Perfection :)
I am so happy for you all! YouTube does suck but all us elder emo dinosaurs are still here!
jeffree: i’m so humble now also jeffree: hasn’t changed everyone watching: omg jeffree has grown so much!  yall 💀
Please release the Shane 2 pallet
2020 did jeffree good, so glad to see!  same here!  love you guys
Please don’t you and Ryland stop YouTube!💜💜🧚‍♀️
I still have your pallet as well. I never canceled you.❤
I’m so sad Jeffree is quitting YouTube
I watch YouTube every day bruh
I'm so happy Jeffrey has Maddie and Shane has Ryland 💕 the true definition of loyalty and friendship, they've stuck with each other through everything and never gave up on one another. 🥹
We need a haunted Wyoming series! ♥️
Shane, we NEEDED THIS!! Thank you so much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please Jeffree and Shane do a haunted video
I’m almost devastated that Jeffree Star will no longer be a “YouTuber” - He has given me so much joy, excitement, laughs, tears… He’s the reason I really gotten into makeup, and only his.  His entire career was built off of YouTube, so seeing him hang it up, almost feels like he doesn’t love makeup anymore; and it’s sad, especially because of how insane the Conspiracy collection went- you two literally broke the internet, for an entire day! I’m gonna miss him: but, he’s right: nobody is watching anymore, well, at least not like they were.  I’m sad, but happy that he’s found joy in other things besides designer clothes, bags, material things. Idk: I need time to process all of this. 🥺
Okay but Shane holding a gun yessss
This is the hell hole closure we deserve.
I MISSED YOU TWO SO MUCH. It sucks Youtube is dying and I want to watch the creators I love, but watching on TikTok or the short videos isn't the same! I love hearing and feeling your personalities and how you think. I love authentic and raw Jeffree and honestly if I could choose, I would just be IRL friends, but these series are the only thing that feel relatable to me. Love yall, I miss Wyoming, I used to live in Laramie and Jackson and miss the quiet. It's where it's at.
jeez, so he just completely shit on shane’s passion atm lol like is it not obvious that shane is there filming a …youtube… video 😂
YouTube won’t die if you don’t let it! YouTube is literally the only thing I watch. It’s my safe space and this broke my heart to hear my favorite creators saying there is no point in creating videos cause YouTube is dying
so if Jeffree is quitting YouTube, how is he going to reveal his products? or will he make anything else? I have so many questions and I’m kinda devastated
New pallet name should be controversy
Hello. No JS I watch you. People now are finding out  another way to enjoy their life without using so much social media. Your life was alway real with goals, plans and purpose. You found ways to reinvent yourself through growth. Life is about change and learning and much more stuff.
There are many people still out here watching YouTube! I don't watch Netflix, HBO, hulu, paramount, peacock etc. I love watching my favorites..and when they disappear idk what I will do.
I’m also so mad that he says nobody’s watching him. We love you
God I love both of them more and more each day 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
I am not going to buy anything advertised from these videos but i wanna see how you guys evolved as people. Hopefully y’all have raised your frequency.
Wait Jeffrey you can’t leave YouTube :( 💔
I’m gonna wait for part 3!
Aw Jeffery leaving YouTube hurts! I refuse to download tik tok, so I’m going to miss him! Before he said that I was thinking how happy he is now and then that bombshell hit hard!
Shane you better not quit youtube! 🙉🙈
No one's watching Jeffrey anymore... that's what Jeffrey meant to say😉 Not that YouTube sucks
Going into the video I was so scared Jeffree was quitting makeup and I was going to die! Quitting YouTube is sad but understandable. Jeffree is so smart in business and in life, he knows what he's doing.
these series always get to me i love the growth of you shane and jeffree thank you for this but one thing is youtube wont be the same with no jeffree ugh yall breaking my heart
I still watch YouTube! 😢 I love YouTube! The Collabs had just stopped & things were on a hault ! But you guys are back! Nooooo Jeffrey! 😢Tik tok is ass!
Was showing the road + new road and saying it's on Google Maps really smart?  I can imagine it's not going to stop spoilt kids making their parents come over and have a mom be like "THESE KIDS PAY YOUR WAGE!!" like at the Team10 house when that was leaked :P XDDD
Jeffree and Shane literally just cancelled YouTube….. genius. I only watched YouTube bc of them together. This is epic… way to go fam! @jeffreestar @shane ❤ can’t wait to see what they do next.
when jeffree says theres no point in creating videos vause no one watches no one cares, i felt that as a artist, even tho i wanna continue, no one looks, no one cares, man idk i feel like giving up but i dont at the same time
I love YouTube I literally watch it everyday all day!! I love watching Jeffree Star! Don't quit... Noooo 😭 😭
Seeing Jeffree living his best life gives me all the feels. I honestly think that Jeffree becoming so wealthy in such a short time frame, and especially in LA, put far too much pressure on him to behave how his fans expected. It was all for show. Just as Norma Jean became Marilyn Monroe with a flip of a switch, so too could Jeffrey Lynn become Jeffree Star in the same way. Both were characters who played a role. JS eventually, sadly became his own worst enemy. JS has a true heart and is a kind man. If people refuse to see that they're into being hateful for the sake of it. In my opinion he was always misunderstood and unfairly and most times cruelly misrepresented. His haters don't have the slightest idea how generous and charitable he has always been. Altruistically so! Jeffree Star has NEVER forgotten where he came from.   His aura is peaceful. I can't imagine not seeing his videos come up on YT. I know his uploads have been sporadic but to be gone completely is a strange thought for sure.... Whatever the universe has in store for Jeffree, I believe in him. He's got this! He walked away from the fake and phony bullshit of LA to find out what truly matters and found his happy place. He emptied out all the toxicity living rent free in his head and found peace of mind. I wish him all the peace and happiness he deserves. This brought back great memories of back in the day. It feels like a lifetime ago. Your friendship with Jeffree is genuine and it's always shown. He trusts you. Thanks for the great video Shane.  Much love 💙 Adelaide, South Australia 🇦🇺
Haven’t watched the whole vid yet but I’m predicting he named the palette “Cancelled”
I can believe that Jeffree is leaving YouTube. Totally understandable, he’s got so much going on now, and honestly, he’s right, I only watch YouTube when a new Shane, Ryland or Morgan video comes out.
Hot topic….power of attraction is real! The more the news covers say school shootings, the more we’re going to have. Don’t watch the news. If there’s something you need to know look up that thing and leave the others!! We need a positive news channel.
i am crying this ep is so funny, jeffree truly deserves the retirement so happy for you both keep staying positive!
Shane please stay on YouTube  we cannot lose you too 😢 😭 😔 😪 😫
As someone who doesn't come from wealth and has always dreamed of this rich, grand lifestyle, this is such an eye-opener to see that Jeffree is happiest living on a ranch just enjoying the natural essence of life. And I agree, everyone is so negatively consumed in social media, constantly relying on a hit of dopamine/serotonin from scrolling or seeing a message or someone liking your post, that they don't even realize its toxic. Honestly enjoyed this video so much and can't wait for part two!
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 💕💗❤️
I'm still watching YouTube daily and missing the ones we've lost...aka Jenna 😭 I am so glad you came back and are making content and truly sad to hear Jeffrey say no one cares... because we do. Sending love and I can't wait for the rest of the series ❤️
For Jeffree having no makeup on he looked so GOOD. He looked happy, LA toxicity washed away.
I still watch utube, but i understand, it is a lot work to put out a video, it has to be worth your time and money!
I'm in tears watching Jeffree strut into the airport - the moment we've waited for!
Jeffree! I care! 💜  I look forward to every video you put out.  I'm saddened to hear you want to quit YouTube but fully understand your choice. 💜 Shane.... don't get any ideas! 🥺
I love the authenticity and pure joy in this series<3 <3 <3
I got overwelmingly sad when jeffree said he’s quiting YouTube, & that he thinks no one cares about it anymore bc I do. it’s one of my only outlets I have since my partner of 8 years passed that brings me any joy at all, especially Shane and jeffrees vidoes
I still watch & post on YouTube. But I do love the ease and speed of TicTok so maybe I am putting too much energy into YT. Lol. This ending made me sad. 😭😭😭
I'm so glad Jeffree is happy doing what he is. But I'm so sad he is not going to be doing YouTube. I guess I'm just old or something because I love watching YouTube for fun. Hard to find good video to watch and now there is going to be one less.. I hope Shane doesn't follow in the same foot steps because I love the videos
i've fcking missed the chaotic energy when shane and jeffree are togetheerrrrr!!!!! I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
well jeffree , i watch each video you post so youtube cares but if you  want to retire you deserve it . time to just celebrate
So sad to hear Jeffrey is Done with youtube I still find myself using the app every day 😢
WWJD! WHAT WOULD JEFREE DO BRAND THAT LMMFAO
I don’t think YouTube is dead. The views on this video is proof. Videos still get lots of views, lots of people still use YouTube. It is still very popular. This video was so good. It was nice to see Shane and Jeffree reunite
Jeffree and Shane both got me through some of the roughest years of my life! I love you both.  PS: I saw a comment above saying you and jeffree making spooky videos of haunted places in Wyoming, would be AMAZING!!
When Jeffery comes to the airport to pick you guys up lmaooo this video is iconic got so many laughs out of it 😂❤
Jeffree makes me want to go big on everything too :p great mindset.
Not true! I’m still beyond in love with YouTube!!!
Tell Jeffree I have always watched him since I found him even now.  But saying that I fully understand him wanting to quit if for no other reason than his sanity I for one will miss him.  He has be a pleasure and a joy to watch.  I am happy to see he has found balance and joy in his life.  I wish him all the best.
Omg noooo. If Jeffree quits youtube ill be so sad. His videos have helped me through some DARK times in my life. I hope you see this jeffree 😩
I’m that loyal fan that waits for anything Jeffree and you post on YouTube. Hit me in the gut to hear the ending of this video. 😣
it's really tough to watch them say youtube is dead and to hear how they feel about youtube now because I watch their videos EVERYDAY. I don't really want that to be over. Watching this feels really depressing; I can feel the loss of hope in this platform. That's terrifying because i'd watch every second of anything any of them  put out. Their channels feel like home.
No YouTube isn't dead. Anyone that's *Cough cough* a little older..... Myself included, will always come HERE and we LOVE long form content. Especially you Shane :)
Jeffree has really changed and it is for the better!  Love his new personality.  I’ve always been in awe of his business sense and his fearlessness in new business adventures.  I love your new series and hope that you do a lot more! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this series, I love watching your videos as well as Jeffree's. I hate to see him walk away from YouTube but I am happy to see him in such a good place. He seems so much happier now, love his StarYak Ranch.
As someone who lives on 248 acres…….. 600 acres IS A LOTTTTTTTT!!!!!! We literally have a tree farm on ours so I can’t even imagine what all is on his!
Jeffree the reason that views are low is because lately people take more than a month to upload on youtube, and it is tiring for us to daily search your names, hoping for a new video and seeing that your last upload was that of a month ago. 😢
Omg Shane on a plane 😳  so relatable
I haven’t watched a single beauty YouTube video in a few years now. I got bored. Jeffree is right. BUT I’m here for this series and any other series Shane puts out. So glad to see Jeffree and Shane’s growth! Love it!
Wow these series always get to me love watching Shane and  together ! These always get me through my day I love them !!❤️
Am I tripping or was this just titled “the retirement of jeffree star” #CONSPIRACY
I care YouTube is all I watch 😞I’ll be sad if we lose Jeffree. First Jenna now Jeffree…
Shane this series is EPIC! It has me super emotional! I can't explain it! I am so happy to see where you are all at now! Your lives are flourishing! It is truly an emotional moment!
I know I don't know you and you don't know me, but you have no idea how close I feel to you guys. 4 years ago I was at the peak of my life, while also watching your series and now all I had is lost, life has changed drastically for me too but I know changes are good and I hope I can get to be as happy as you are right now
Probably won't be watching any more of this series. Sorry Shane, this sucks and is kinda depressing.
OMG OMG OMG! No more Jeffrey on YouTube?! I’m completely deflated 😞. If he has to do it, then he has to do it, I get it. I certainly don’t want him to burn out. I just want him to be happy.
thank god I'm a millenial ....times are getting shittier and shittier...
Im still here on YouTube. .  I get all my info "in general" on YouTube. . I can't imagine the day I don't. . Shane as always. . Great job. . can't wait til next week!!!
I DON"T do TICK TOCK! never EVER have been on ticktock before. So Youtube IS NOT dead! This is where I watch all my favorites. Not all your fans are 13-25 years old, ya know! I'm 46 and tick tock is just not my thing. So just because everyone else is doing the tick tock thing doesn't mean you have to follow the crowd! or quit youtube. Because if Jefferie goes completely to tick tock, then, I guess He'll be losing at least one subscriber..,.
I love these so much I hate waiting a whole week for another one
I wonder if this will inspire Shane to grow out of Youtube and finally direct horror films
I understand what Jeffree is saying, he’s a smart business man so if he’s making a choice it’s for the right reason to him. I agree the pandemic changed a lot of things, for entertainment etc and a lot of the YouTubers we all grew up watching are growing up themselves and changing or building families etc and YouTube just isn’t becoming a priority anymore. I personally love to watch long form media still so I do want YouTube to make a comeback but I also understand why TikTok is booming… like most things it’s a circle and I do think personally that YouTube is the better content in terms of what you get as an audience member. I love podcasts and documentaries and tutorials or travel vlogs etc
*me watching youtube all day* *they saying its dead*
shane i’m so thankful that you’ve come back to youtube. your videos & your humour have always made me feel so confident about myself which is something i’ve always struggled with. i watched you for years & this feels like pure nostalgia. never been happier ❤️❤️❤️
*me watching youtube all day* *they saying its dead*
Okay but, Jeffree looks SO GOOD
Jeffree not on YouTube anymore 😔 I've been watching him since I was 15 on Myspace, I'm about to be 31 now. Hopefully  he'll be on tiktok and other platforms more then, but I really just hate to even hear that!
Uhm I’m watching this currently, when y’all are walking through the airport in CO going to his house, you said “we should give her the cancelled palette”.. uhm I had an earth asking moment where I had an idea. Y’all should collab on a palette, and call in “CANCELLED”.. I would DIE
Not gonna worry I do think YouTube is going downhill
I’m so sad to hear that “YouTube is dead” and no one watches it anymore. Tik Tok is far too overwhelming, I much prefer long term content and really getting to know the people I subscribe to on YouTube. I will be too sad if Jeffree stops posting.
I felt sick after Jeffree pulled the gun out. Absolutely revolting. I’m in utter shock that you edited that into this series? Shocked.
This just makes me so happy. It's everything.
This is sad because I don’t go on tik tok and I still LOVE YouTube. And it’s moments like these where if all the people I watch move on to other platforms, it almost forces me to do it too :/ and I don’t want to.
love this kind of content
Jeffrie has like 700 hundred dogs.   *Me with nine doggos* that's a lot
JEFFREE BEFORE YOU GO - WE NEED THE JEFFREE x SHANE HAUNTED WYOMING SERIES!
I really love his editing.
This makes my heart so happy for Jeffree🥹 so nice to see him happy and thriving 💕
off topic but where are Jeffree's couches from? lol
Jeffree looks better than ever
I was shit talking the last episode.. it was confusing and boring.... but Jeffree looks so great! He seems healthy and happy.
Oh my god I need jeffree and Shane to go ghost hunting 🤣😈 that would be one for the history books
It is so crazy to me that YouTube views have dropped so much..this is what I grew up on as entertainment and it gave me a place to in a weird way meet/get to know the people making the videos which I think made it so personal. Like with watching a movie you might like the actor but you will never seen them as raw and real as you would if they were on YouTube just vlogging their lives.
Loved it xx 😘 ❤
Ryland is such a diva hahaha 😂
That is so sad!!!! The fact that people are watching long series like this, doesn't mean anything!?
This was great.
Gosh, im so excited to watch the rest of this series. Love Jeffree and Shane together, such a great duo. This is what Youtubes missed.
I think YouTube is different than any other platform in the fact that long-formatted videos will always be something people will want/rely on. YouTubers might be a dying breed and migrating to new platforms like Tik Tok and Twitch but I will always be a YouTube kid and will continue to watch and support y'all <3
😍 love it❤ y’all are so happy now and enjoying life ❤
I still come home from work and watch YouTube, but not as much as I used too ❤️ still live for shane videos 😭
I love this Shane and Jeffree.  ❤
Yes, I went to google to look up the street that Jeffree named 😊
💕💕💕
I love Wyoming Jeffree.
Jeffree is the most inspiring person of this era.. been watching him since myspace and seeing him go through these transitions and his journey growing and exploring himself is truly beautiful. I appreciate him as a human for showing people that everything is possible ..
Jeffreys living the best life out there. I love this guy no matter what they say. Hes very beautiful inside and out. And you shane. You always have my support. I love both of you.❤💗❤
only youtuber keeping me from deleting youtube since they removed the sorting thing
I love this I truly love you both and have supported for decades - I have no felt this connected to jeffree in months and it’s very refreshing to see you both beginning a completely new journey in life. One step at a time but this all feels genuine 🫶🏼♥️
The Georgia Bulldog flags XD Go Dawgs!
I’m excited to watch more but I have mixed emotions about Jeffree leaving YouTube. At the end of the day it seems so much better for his mental health and I’m happy about that, but I’m so sad to see another one of my favs leaving YouTube.
I get where jef coming from like if he want to quit that’s understandable but for him to say we’re wasting our time like he’s throwing Shane in it I don’t respect that like if no one’s watching you that doesn’t mean we’re not watching Shane!! All I’m saying is speak for yourself don’t try to take Shane down with you!!
Wasn't it just titled the retirement of JS?
I guess I am the only one cause YouTube is all I watch. I have fb but never look at it. While everyone else has fb, tik tok, instagram, Snapchat I have YouTube. I really hope Jeffree decides not to leave. Oh no!
I am still a YouTube girl. I couldn't care less about tik tok. Plus I watch my fav youtubers more than I watch TV
You really should have charged hummer for this video. xD
Aha noo don't got jeffree 😭
i appreciate all your uploads but i am dying for a new episode of podcast!! i love Jerid so much <3 i love you all but Jerid is the homies lol completely fell in love with him since you started the pod
I still watch YouTube every day 😢😢😢😢
SHHHAAAANNNEEE WOOT WOOT 🙌 I have been waiting forever ❤️ SHHHHAAANNNEEE WOOT WOOT 🙌  Welcome back 😊 🦋 ✨️
Oh I just can't believe it!! I still watch jeffree!! But the best part is to see you all so happy!! This whole thing makes me so happy to see..  can't wait for part 3 ❤️
I personally love YouTube
Wow…. Jeffree’s quitting YouTube? I think that’s so sad. I don’t think necessarily YouTube died out… He just flopped after breaking up with Nate and then the cancellation and then the pandemic happened🫠  He could try mixing up his videos?! Things are different now. He’s different now. I feel so sad. End of an era😪
I watch youtube daily for hours on hours. Please don‘t quit you guys!! 😢
Cash grab imo
Oh wowwwww
YouTube isn’t dead 😢
Holy shit they just cancelled YouTube…..
PLEASE GO TO A HAUNTED LOCATION AND FILM IT PLEASE LET THAT BE IN HERE OMG
look im just saying at the end of this series …..if there was ever a pre order …… im intrigued
We still watch but I think everything that came about with the pandemic changed the world as we know it and like Jeffree many of us also had a reality check, this deep realization and understanding that we never had prior. Just go be 😊
Loving this so far!!!!
I love how excited he is to see them 😩 carrying the luggage and everything
people like shane are still doing fake laughs... so sick of that
Shane pls what is this song “summertime everything’s just find”
I’m honestly soo happy to see you guys back together and to see Jeffree soo relaxed and at peace and truly seem happy is everything!! Shane even seems more relaxed. I love all of you!! Can’t wait to see the rest!!
So many emotions in this video. I don't know how to feel honestly. Not seeing jeffree on YouTube is going to be weird. Please don't ever leave is shane 💔
Jeffree just whipping out a gun and teaching Shane how to properly hold it both made me smile and respect Jeffree a hell of a lot more. Good on ya Jeffree.
I can’t tell if Jeffree looks healthier or if it’s just that I’ve never seen him with real eyebrows
I litterally watch youtube everyday and I care! I know I’m not the only one who still wants to follow your journeys! 😢
❤❤❤❤
so excited Shane's making a series again. King of docs
Is this the first part ? Or should I watch the “cancel of Jeffrey” from like a week ago
Did everyone just forget all he did?
I love Jeffree so much and joining up with Shane makes me smile!❤❤ Been big fans of both of them for many years from the very beginning.
Hey! I love my Texan twang😂😂
Lmao i laughed trough the whole video! Love you guys togheter
Wait YouTube isn’t dead 😢I love y’all this is bringing me so much life
I don’t necessarily agree people don’t watch YouTube anymore .
Choquée like vraiment 💔
shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane
Shane, your channel feels like home❤ Thank you for still making content after everything
Wow 😖😖
Best version of Jefferey yet! Its SO obvious he has done some WORK on himself. Humble, light, FUNNY. Just eminating this positivity that is infectious. Jefferey, this higher frequency living look Goooooood on you!
Shane and Jeffree’s series is my go-to comfort place here in YT 😢
As a car lady, I am seriously wondering where are the rest of Jeffree’s cars?
I love the chemistry between shane and his majesty Jeffree. Love that they are together again they should just have quarterly podcasts. Filming and editing on point!!
slay gays
I still like to watch reveals on YouTube idc about tik tok but I like reveals
I am Sooooooo happy this video came out today!!!!! I love both of you and Jeffree Shane.
Stoop I’m crying nooo jeffreee please
I like his finger nails That's part of make up and having your own line of fingertips would be real nice
if hes into donations, i could use a Birkin :)
So basically this is a boost for his brand with the release of another palette on the 11th. It’s so obvious and not to mention the one eye symbol in the arcade machine
I don't believe youtube is dead, plenty of youtubers are still very active and getting a lot of view/ commentary. It might just be that this is the end of the road for shane and jeffrey. Unless they completely start over with new channels about farm lifestyle/whatever Shane life style is then they would probably be happier.
Ok to see Shane and Jeffrey do a ghost hunt together would be litteraly everything lol Do it!!!
Im so happy to see this video. It makes me so excited for the next, to see how you and Jeffree are ❤ Love you're vidoes
I’m happy to see everyone happy and thriving ❤❤ I’m said JS wants to end YouTube.  YouTube was a rescue during the pandemic…I loved your last series Shane! Keep up the good work with Ryland! ❤❤
Cancel culture has to stop.  Every human deserves the opportunity to grow from failures.  NO ONE deserves to have every future success blighted.  Not for some ignorant crap said in our early 20's.  Thank you Shane for the joy!!  Sorry we let you down.
I would love to see Jeffrey in rural Maine...I really think he could appreciate the beauty here. Truely loved seeing you two together again. Shane always manages to show the human side of Jeffrey and I am so here for it!
Where’s jeffree? I need him.
I would HATE for him to quit but if he is going to then I see no better way than for this to be the way!
Damn that hurt 😢 not going to lie I watch TikTok now but I love sitting down and watching a creator
I love how inteligent Jefree is
I could not be happier with this series! Seeing y’all catch up really brought me to tears 😭❤️ No matter what I’ll always be checking for new shane videos DAILY
Loveee the video but plzzz make this shit longer
Shane why you dont love the others that Was whit you in the Beginning Let me know why you dont reunited whit them???? For cristhmas for God sake???? Please
I am on here everyday while sewing my orders watching all my favorites. he cant leave.
I don’t care what the world thinks, I love Shane and Jeffree 💜🖤
I'm here everyday watching my favs 😭😭😭 Shane you just came back! Don't go away plz
I'm so happy to see Jeffree and Shane together ❤️  I love shane and jeffree  I miss jeffree 😢
We have all grown up together, messed up, cried and gotten back up. Don’t leave YouTube, we’re still here 🥹😕
make the pallet 👀👀👀
Sad reality is not all are favorite you tubers can do it forever
I admit I'm conflicted when it comes to Shane and Jeffree.... I'm not shamed to say it.
I love your YouTube videos jeffree I’m not sure what you’re talking about , I absolutely loathe tiktok , I don’t understand it , it doesn’t really give you a way to connect with the person on the other end or to know who they are. I hope you one day reconsider the YouTube thing because all those other platforms you named are fizzling out. They don’t have new shoes if they do they’re all the same. Love you jeffree and I hope you still do the videos on YouTube.
I watch YouTube all the time! I don't know much about TicTok, please don't quit, Jeffree
I don't think I can still be on YouTube without Jeffree Star. Jeffree is one of my favorite vloggers and he is one of the reasons why I survive this pandemic.
Is Jeffree not going to make makeup anymore? Omg can u imagine. I would die.
amazing shane keep it going im so glad your posting again!
It's nice to see Jeffery and I truly hope he is as happy as he's showing us. I love your series Shane and hope for more. I love you too Chris and Ryland 💕
It’s unfortunate that Jeffree still can’t tell the truth while claiming to. It’s a fact he still reads comments and still gets easily bent out of shape.
Jeffree quitting 😱😭😭😭 nooooooo
“As long as u don’t use they and them nyoull be fine “ LMAOOO😭
The reunion ❤
Shane “ this feel like rehab 😂 “
I love you guys but why are you flying to Casper
Noooo @jeffree 😭😭 i click and watch his videos 😢 lolol damn this is sad newssss i always loved jeffree star even when people talked shit and tried cancelling him dam.. o well
Am.... in shock
😂❤😢
40:54 @Liora Y !!! Girl you made it!!!
Ugh jeffree leaving YouTube makes me sad honestly but I get it also. Ugh sometimes I hate how things fade
Good thing I watched this on YouTube!! It might be dead for him.. but not for you two.
Oh my heart
Love youuuu
Am I missing a video or was this called the retirement of Jeffree Star and then it got changed? I know its dumb but I'm panicking thinking there's a lost video I don't have access to 🤣
Not me getting emotional of Jeffree retiring. He can't leave us. I'm still on YouTube daily, maybe do something a few times a year. 🥺 I'm not ok with this retirement t
i just wanna say Im 20 and still refresh youtube to see you and jeffrees content I love jeffrees videos they bring me so much joy
Love you Ryland & Shane ❤ Been a fan since 2012!
Buffy sucks. I bought it and it’s just not great for the price. I will go back to my Sunday Citizen blanket !
I love youtube. So if you leave i wont follow to tik tok. I love your content but sorry wont go
dont leave youtube jeffree!! Maybe you can do lifestyle vlogs etc!
When you announced it was another series with Jeffree, I was a tad disappointed, as I was hoping for something new. But.....I am so pleased you did this. Seeing how grounded and content he is, is amazing. Im sad he's leaving, I've watched him since my space. But, he's healthier and happier and its great to see. It was nice to see your friendship too.
Ok why am I seriously 😍 on Jeffree right now, he's so freaking cute!
Jefree is giving me very much King of the mafia vibes, like Queer Pablo Escobar realness 🕴🏽🔫🔪💰💎🤵🏼☠️👀🙊 just saying…
Im so sad that he quits, but I also feel so happy for him. He changed in a positive way and I will never forget him. Thank you for everything Jeffree you’re such an inspiration❤
A masterpiece, like always
I love both Jeffree and Shane and I love Jeffrees videos :(
i can’t live without you or jeffree i’m so sad…
this will genuinely kill me when jeffree leaves yourubw he has gotten me through so so much
I cannot wait to watch Ep 3, love you guys so much ❤️
Youtube is still good Jeff , you just have too much money to realize it's worth I think.
If I were in the yak world, I fear I would be in the meat field. 😳 I guess, in the real human world, I was never sanctioned so I am not cancelled. Yet.
As a vegan the Yak's business is deplorable
Ryand's cute smart-ass costume change getting as gay as possible upon arrival , im dead. Fukin love you guys. Werk¡
I love YouTube, I’m constantly on this app
I was at work and literally had to go on a break to just start this 🥰 I. NEED. MORE. Keep up the ✨STAR✨ content queen
I wish these were longer 😢I couldn’t wait to come home from work get into my pjs and curl up in my bed to watch 💕💕💕
I absolutely love seeing you back
I’ll take a couple of Jeffrees 5000 purses if he really doesn’t want them 🙃
Jeffree looks so peaceful. It's almost like the Jeffree Persona is gone and a raw Jeffree nows move forward
I’m only here for Shane at this point. This man is carrying this platform along with a few others. I’m gone if Shane is gone. The end of this video was too real.
shane I still love youtube plz don’t leave lol
So happy your making content again that makes you happy and ik you work so hard on your docuseries videos but I really hope you guys are still doing the podcast. Listening to your podcast feels like I'm just chilling with some friends and I miss Jared!
I'm still clicking 🥹
I thought he already quit YouTube
Im so happy for Jeffree, the fact that he was able to walk away from all the negativity in LA after eveything he's been through is so inspiring 💯 He's grown so much and I love it!! He's also thriving in Wyoming 😌. I missed him and Shane together ! 😫 Good for you Jeffree!! 😊
I still care.
I’m at work, I can’t watch this yet but omg! I can’t waiiiiiit
I just want to thank everyone who made this possible. I've been watching this saga for years, and it has taught me so much about the importance of wealth. Not financially, or materially (although it's heavily featured), it's about wealth of character, wealth of happiness, wealth of love, wealth of genuineness. And I've watched them gather this wealth, and it's given me something to strive for. This wealth is attainable because it's not all about money (but ngl, it'll definitely help), it's about prioritizing what's really important to you and your general happiness. I'm so glad that Jeffree appears to have found his bliss. I hope it lasts forever 💚
I still remember Jeffree from myspace, he looks at so much peace now 😌  I'm Happy for him
It's pretty true though, I love you guys but trying to get myself to watch something more than 2 minutes AND that wasn't TT or IG I was like, whut, I guess so..they the OG so I'll see what's up 😅 So excited for the final chapter here and to see where you guys wind up next!
You know, i am against their past and not forgave them (i know they dont care) but what i really admire is that they sick with each other like real friends and change through all of it
People still care about YouTube, they just got sick of the drama and for many, the “cancelling” was the final straw for watching JS. Plenty of people I know still go home and flick through YouTube.
Not the title and thumbnail change!
Why he changed the title ?
not the silencer 😅😭
Jeffree, I know you won’t see this.. but in the slightest chance you may, please don’t quit. I miss the old YouTube. Before cancel culture. When people could joke around and nobody took it to heart. I wish that we could go back two years when it felt like the world was at such a happy place and now it just feels like everyone finds any reason to put someone down and it’s terrible. I don’t want you, or Shane to go anywhere. I binge watch your channels (and Jenna Marbles, UGH I miss her so much too) every single day. YouTube isn’t dead! If you guys did more collar videos like this, I know you’d get the views! (Not that you’re not amazing by yourself, but I LIVE for the collabs!) Anyway, I’ll miss you so much if you go. Please don’t. 😢
Damn we need these shades 😲😲😲😲😥
❤️❤️❤️
Nooooo!!! But! But! I STILL CARE ABOUT YOUTUBE!! 😂 I STILL CLICK! Don’t leave 😩 omg and Shane don’t you dare follow in his footsteps!
So excited for the new video to end up sad... thanks a lot Shane
jeffree and shane should get into make-up for man. I'll def get me one of those
Please don’t stop making videos either of you but please also don’t let this just be a long awaited series just to sell another palette again 😭
Shane, hear me out… I’ve got two shade name ideas.  1.) I have so many questions  2.) We’ll get to that later   LENGTHY, I KNOW buttttttt
Don't tell me that Shane's gonna quit YouTube too after this series
I smiled and laughed thru this whole episode. I wasnted more and was sad when it was over. Im so excited for part 3 whenever it drops.
No one watches YouTube? I watch it everyday lol Jeffery
I do, i watch YouTube for fun. And I never been on tik tok cuz I refuse to. We do exist!!! 🙋🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
I love the video!! ❤️❤️I’m so happy that Jeffree is so happy, But, I disagree with him so much. I love YouTube! I’m in here daily and I get on TikTok as well sometimes. I’m so sad to see that he’s leaving. I really pray that you and Ryland stay. I don’t know what I would do without your videos making me smile! Jeffree say it ain’t so..😭
Woooo this episode really was a roller coaster of emotions. I'm so sad and happy for jefree and i hope the third episode ends on a high note because my little heart can not take this
💕💕💕💕 it's reminiscent of the good ol days
When Jeffree said “because I had an exhausted fucking game!” I died 😂
Wyoming Here! I live north/east of Casper Wyoming! LOVE YOU SHANE&JEFFREE🤠
Shane, thank you so much for this series. I finally feel a spark in YouTube again. Jeffree should know that I grew up watching his videos! We are still watching him🥺🥺
i still go on youtube everyday waiting for my fave ppl to post. Jeffree isnt totally wrong. Youtube isnt how it was before. After my fave ppl post, i have nothing or no one to watch.... and i just feel sad. Im also scared for the day that everyone i love on here moves on. Though I rather see them leave happy and fulfilled than some fuckin horrible shit that they did comes to life... a lot of that happening in the last decade... :(
Jeffrey I love you but I have to disagree with you about YouTube.  I enjoy watching your videos and look forward to seeing your new collections.  I don't have tik tok and don't care about it.  But if you are not happy doing YouTube anymore then I support you all the way.  I will miss you though I'll just have to look for any new collections on your website.. I'm really enjoying this video series love you guys.  Peace and love to you and your families 💜💚💜💚💜💚
The only critique I have is the zoom on the camera!! The noise it makes is annoying and distracting.  And I don't want to be distracted - I want to watch and enjoy the series!! Which I do,...just wish that noise wasn't all over the entire series!!
Okay but a haunted series exploring the paranormal hotspots in Wyoming with Jeffree would be sooooooooooooooooo goooooood
I couldn't agree more this just feels right you two together and ripping the band off. I love these series and you all together! We are ready for this love you Shane and Jeffrey!!
Wait you changed the title? In 2 hours? It said the retirement of jeffree star. Now it says the new world of jeffree star
“Time to Jenna Marbles and do something else” :)))))))  But honestly he opened a big wound with that one.  But to be honest Jenna saw that it was over with YouTube a looong time ago. Also, so glad Jeffre is much happier, he look healthier both physically and mentally WHAT A LEGEND and he went out with a bang and huge middle finger to the fake and materialistic life of social media and L.A So proud of Shane for being back and getting over all the crap from before, he is and will always be one of the most real and amazing people of YouTube who have left a mark on our childhood’s along side Jenna and Justine and so many others.  Love you man I have been watching since the old days of pranks with Lisa and mystery tin can or what they were with Joey
I always get excited when I see new reveals, or little life updates from you all of you because we enjoy thr content. We still watch you guys because we love yall. We have since the beginning and there are people who still love and support you guys. I would genuinely be sad to not see any more videos from Jeffree. Ill even pay a whole new subscription along with my others just to watch JeffreeStarTV if I need to. We support either way.. 🙏🏽
🤍
vinci will always be my fav pomeranian! He so cute!
"It feels right.. because it's with you."  😭😭😭❤❤❤
I love Jeffree, he's just so real, and there are just too many fake people in the world
I love YouTube but what I watch has definitely changed over the years I also don’t really use TikTok so maybe that’s why i like longer vids
It's cool , cause it's a great chapter of both the lives  Seems more down to earth
As we watch this on actual YouTube. Lol. Savage.
The way this made my entire night! It feels so nostalgic!!!
I hope you don't stop making YouTube videos too, Shane. I still watch every video you put out and until you choose to hang it up, I always will. Love you Shane.
i was going to trauma dump but i realized you hold too much trauma-anyways-please don’t stop posting!!
YouTube is dead? 🙃
The gun part is actually pretty insane and scary. Not proper way to hold at all very dangerous
damn, the big youtubers are clocking out
You tube is changing but with that said… I love watching this and rylans vlogs of your guys’ life!
Yes girl my js teaching gun safety 🤣
I watch you Jeffy :( I'm sad now my heart is broken love you and Shane
JS: "no one cares. No one watches YouTube anymore.."    Me: watching this on YouTube, on the train.. 😒🤷🤌.. while it has 200k in just an hour and 40 mins of being posted.
Are we supposed to be shook that Jeffree is quiting youtube? He barely posts now anyway.  And I do like youtube, find it fun, like to watch all my faves.
I’ve missed this so much, it’s made me beyond happy 😁This is my favourite type of content from you , Jeffree seems like a great supportive friend and you have great chemistry which shows on camera . Please do more videos with him in !
I watch YT & I click. I refuse to go to TT. So all I can say is “Good luck J ⭐️. It’s been a ride”.
Nothing but laughs and fun from all of you in that hummer. Jeffree is so much happier and that’s all I can want for anyone. I’ll miss seeing as much as we did but I’m happy he’s happy.
Jeffrey shading youtube hard....meanwhile I am enjoying every bit of still watching youtube videos 🤠🙈
I understand why he's leaving YouTube... He's already missed, but seeing Jeffeee living his best life in Wyoming is so inspiring, but so is seeing you and Ryland living in Colorado as well... For me... You are both why I watched YouTube to begin with... Still do and always will...  Nothing but love and respect for Jeffree. 🤍🌟🤍🌟🤍🌟
Wow! I don’t know why but I started crying when they met at the airport. My mouth is wide open when Jeffrey said You Tube sucks, this is all I watch. Will surely miss him!
I still watch YouTube for enjoyment 🥺💕
Ok so I’m gonna need that duo chrome green color right away as well as that glitter black!!
People have to do what makes them happy and keeps the passion for life going. If walking away from YouTube is what needs to happen yes it will suck to loose that content that view into a life other than our own the escape from reality but we need to be thankful we even got to see these people at all. I feel blessed to have found the creators i enjoy and I’m glad they were willing to share their time energy and lives with us all especially for as long as many of them have. Yes I will miss it like I would miss a friend who moved on but I am also happy that they are following their hearts and that I had their content for the time that I did. Heck these two specifically helped me get my mind off having cancer and being alone threw it all. Their videos were the only things with me as I went threw surgery and recovering. I am so grateful to have had that so who am I to complain and get angry when they need us to understand and let them go so they too can heal and be happy in life. Personally I just wish I could thank them for all the hard work and time as well as energy they put into this for as long as they have. They did this for us more than anything and I’m thankful for it. I wish them all the happiness and goodness the world has to offer. Life’s a journey so why waist time being unhappy when you can thrive and grow in a positive way.
wow two more videos and he’s done 😢
I've never seen this guy jeffree Star but I am a fan
YouTube is definitely still my main form of entertainment I'm clicking still!
I watch YouTube for long form content 😢 Shane I hope you never quit you are so talented
i still watch youtube Jeffree! but ive shifted from beauty content to true crime.
“No one goes to YouTube anymore” yet here we all are. If you have the right content we will come. I bet if Jeffree made videos about ranch life, more people would watch. I just think people were getting tired of his materialistic lifestyle and basically the videos were just the same thing over and over. I started getting a little bored but I’d like to see what he does now living a more normal life.
Wait so is jefree done with YouTube?
I love watching Jeffree videos 😥
Love the ranch all that land. I would ❤❤❤ that! I would have tons of cameras and guns for self defense- I’m sure there it wouldn’t be a problem crime is probably seriously low compared to the more city places. So that’s a plus. But he should have cameras all around his land for sure.
oh my heart 'time to jenna marbles and do something else'. </3 like i am sure she is more at peace. i legit mean that. but boy, do i miss seeing her and listening to her. just as i would if anything happened with y'all. <3 but again, your peace it number one priority, whatever that takes ^-^. xoxo
If u want a small population my town has  about 8,000 free roaming citizens
Bro idk, I don't like how they are being so casually with guns laying everywhere.
There has to be a peak when it comes to veiws or sales of a product. The level of success you two reached wasn't sustainable, not for anyone. It was a beautiful moment and now on to something new. I for one am still here for the Dawson/Adams train, and I glad Jeffrey found something new to make him happy.
I genuinely love the friendship between Shane and Jeffree.
I just loooove seeing you 2 together 🦀🦞 💗
I still watch YT though @jeffreestar
i watch youtube instead of tv 😭🤣
He’s (as in Jeffree) wrong about YouTube. The moment all my favorite influencers from my generation (I’m 30 born in 1992) go off YouTube is the moment I’ll get rid of all streaming services and tvs. I don’t use TikTok or instagram and don’t plan on ever doing it.
Id just like to say youtube is still my main form of entertainment. I love youtube and Im not into tiktok or streaming personally. I watch it so much I didnt realize it was a dying platform.
*releases the pallet and names it Cancelled” 😂👏🏼
I love the whole new energy Jeffree is radiating. Shane and Rylan too, it’s so odd to feel we know these people, because Shane does such a fantastic job of making us feel part of the story.  I don’t know if I could eat Yak though. I keep hearing “ Yak in a box” in my head 😂
We love the “new” Shane 😍😍the confidence yassss 😍
Not gonna lie I literally used to spend any screen time on YouTube but now not as much and only really watch Shane and the podcast which is AMAZING LOVE IT even have my husband watching too
Bro wtf are Ryland’s outfits
That Jenna marbles comment hit in such a hard sad way...nice to see Jeffree so happy though
Shane please don't quit YouTube. YouTube is where I go every single day and it makes me so happy. I've watched your videos since 2012 and I'm not done watching any time soon ❤️
i need part 3 already
There's SO FRIGGIN MUCH I want to say but the most important thing is that I am BEYOND happy to see you guys, you, Ryland, Jeffree, all of you guy's loved ones, just EVERYONE in a MUCH better place. All of you deserve it, ALWAYS HAVE!!!!! Just think about what you have created together, nobody will ever be able to take that away from you ever, no stupid sheep driven cancelation, nor anything or anyone else! You can be so proud of yourselves and I can't be happier for you 🥺❤️ I've been trying to reach out for many times on IG (Twitter wasn't even an option for me to be honest 😂) but now seeing you all just happy, mentally especially, I am honestly calm and now I can enjoy your creativity again. Worries were a big part but it's all coming from my heart, so, nothing of it is bad in itself anyway. Just, being happy for you is indeed BETTER 😎 And YES, you can clearly SEE the balance and happiness in Jeffree's eyes. This moved me to tears, but all in all, it's happy tears because it's you guy's life and all I want for you is to keep this happiness 🥺❤️ and if it means that you won't please all the audience's desires anymore, so be it.  Health, happiness, joy, friendship, love and appreciation to you guys, from the bottom of my heart!  Much love from a random Croatian girl in Germany 🤗 PS @Jeffree: yes, we do care. I don't even have a streaming thing, I'm ONLY on YouTube. So, just saying 😊
Camera man did good!!!
Omg!! #JeffreeStar you can’t quit YouTube!
I pretty much only watch youtube and listen to podcasts. I will miss Jeffree’s content. I trust his reviews.
It’d be really cool if they did end up releasing the conspiracy palette part 2 and named it “CANCELLED” or something. It be an “iconic” comeback for those two being together.
After all the drama and even myself found myself angry about the stuff that came out but its also very refreshing to see all of you get through it and grow...JS seems alot more humble and it shows ppl can learn and grow...
As they say in Wyoming, yeehaw
Damn I will miss him so so much I care and will always watch
if it will bring jeffree more peace to quit youtube, i completely understand that decision <3. however, if it's solely because he thinks people do not care, some of us still do. maybe the type of content could be adjusted if that interests him? like, i love these type of videos of shane's [just the connection building, hanging out, talking, doing your thing]. it really hurts my heart knowing he feels that way, that no one cares. i choose youtube over tiktok, netflix, etc. but i am also someone that has been on here since myspace days and like the simplicity of 'older times'. no matter what y'all do though, just know you are loved and cared about by more people than you'll ever truly know or believe. it sucks that negativity and toxicness is louder than positivity ://
Jeffree is literally a different person; relaxed and so sincere and so natural x
*changes title of video*
I LOVE YOU🤍
Thank you guys sm for made videos together I love makeup bc Jeffrey and I still use My conspiracy palette such a precious gif you made for us ✨
Dang 19.5M Subs I didn't realize he had a peak count of 23M before the controversy. He really did lose 3.5M subs.
This series is such a weird thing for me to watch.  The Conspiracy Palette series got me through some of the hardest days of my life and now to come back to these two all over again is so... heart-wrenching isn't the word.  But it's so emotional in both good and bad ways.  My heart.  ♥
Woooo let’s go🥳
I love Shane and Jeffree together.🥰
That bombshell at the end! 💥😮
Listen the happiness is everything and scrolling through Jeffery’s page and looking at views for him 2 million views is trash his last video is at 550k
Your growth, not just as people, but as artists is beautiful to observe. I am so glad you two are still creating together 💙☺️
Jeffree is v beautiful
Colorado air is most definitely not clean
Also jeffree must be german cause I swear he said Oma's for his puppies that had past. And I absolutely love that. Im german myself and hopefully I heard that correctly but if hedid say Oma's I absolutely love it 🥺💕
Not the sentimental music during the Gucci shoes discussion lol 🙄
It’s great to see Jeffree and Shane looking so happy to be working together again xx
Watching you guys have fun in the car made me so happy! Totally relatable , I have an Audi S4 and it’s Modded , we be flying on the country roads! Be safe ♥️
Weird cause I love youtube
Not sure if Im crazy but I can see a change  in Jefferey's demenor. It's him but it looks natural; less forced.
ok but the palette reveal?
Jeffree is so country now lol I love him so much ❤
I would love if for Jeffree‘s last video on YouTube, he dropped every single receipt he ever had on somebody just for the pure joy and chaos of it all.
Btw I love Shane and Jeffree together
As a user, I'm always on youtube! But as a creator though, ugh, I felt that.
I’m seriously living for this
So good. Love these
Shane with a gun? What world am I living in? 😂
I’m only watching this because of Jeffree Star! I hope he doesn’t leave YouTube. I miss his reviews.
am i crazy? to me tiktok is what sucks and youtube is what brought me so much joy throughout my life i hate fast trends and dumb transitions and short form content like i love sitting down and watching these longer videos that actually have substance :/
Oh this is so great to love what you are doing and watching you over the years grow so much is amazing love you
I go on youtube daily for comfort so for jeffree to say no one watches yt anymore makes me so sad 😭
This video is so refreshing, Jeffree Star becomes Jeff. I would miss him on YouTube but seriously do you baby.  Loving this series.
We’re clicking :( lolol
You can feel how much Jeffree has changed and matured for the better. I am also loving his look with the short hair and real eyebrows. Glad he has found more peace. It does feel like the end of an era.
I'll never not be watching Youtube. I grew up with Youtube. Specifically have watched you since 2009. No shitty TikTok or streaming service will replace Youtube in my eyes.
Always with the cliff hangers, I can't wait for the next part!!
Jeffree quitting YouTube bc “no one watches anymore…YouTube sucks…wasting our time…” Basically because no one is watching him anymore lmao.
This might sound weird but Jeffree looks SO GOOD with his eyebrows back lol
I wish y’all would release the 2nd Collab
Why r u back
Love love love
When jeffree said youtube was dead and no one watches the videos and no one cares I was SCREAMING at the TV like NO HUN!!!! I couldn't live without YouTube  Shane don't get any ideas I swear to god 😤
Shane, I promise you’re not wasting your time on making videos for YouTube. I’m ALWAYS waiting for more. I love the content you create! This whole video had me laughing, feeling sad, feeling happy, feeling refreshed, feeling confused, ALL THE EMOTIONS. Only YOU make videos that can take me on such a rollercoaster and I love it! ❤
I LOVE YOUTUBE!!!!!!
I believe people do still watch YouTube, but there are other social media platforms that more popular. Im glad he is retiring from YouTube and not his beauty business. I would die 😭
17:01 killed me 😭
AGH!!! NOOO I dont wanna wait another week to finish it!
Did the title change? When I first clicked it said the retiring of Jeffree Starr
Shane, I hope you know your videos matter to me, to so many of us. I hope you never get to a place where you think what you create doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve watched you from the beginning and when I’ve been my most depressed, feel like I can’t go on, I always turn your videos on to lift my spirits. You have saved my life more times than I can count. When or if you decide to move on, I will respect that but know that you will be so missed.
Not me on YouTube every day of life watching Shane's comeback to hear Jeffree say no one uses YouTube anymore... I still watch his videos too, the 500k+ of his viewers will miss him
Im sooo not happy!!!!!
❤ Oh No Jeffree!!! 💔 😢💔 but I get what he is saying… it’s sad that youtube just isn’t working for the beauty community anymore…
Been watching Shane since 2007. Wild
Jefree and guns.....I'm in heaven
aww I’m so sad at the thought of Jeffree leaving YouTube! But also happy that he’s happy and care-free! It just shows how Gen-Z have impacted the ways of social media, it’s all about instant gratification and TikTok now!
i wish these were longer, love seeing you Shane and Jeffree
Me just patiently waiting for Shane to drop more pod casts in between also watching these series videos. 😅
With Maddie there, it feels even more nostalgic, its like the old days but deep down we know it isn't and it'll never be the same again.
I only watch YouTube 😭
The silencer on that gun girl😅
This whole video makes my heart smile.
I love you guys
thumbs up if you watch YouTube  lol
Jeffree is dead wrong about youtube being dead... ppl still watch YouTube on a daily.. I use this app and Instagram more then any other app
52:00 true. We can still save it though but we have to stop joking and take it more serous. if not the old TV will take over YT like it is today.
Love to all of you❤️
I'm really not into Tiktok, Netflix thingy. I still love to watch here in YouTube and just waiting for a new video of you two and I just started making coins and finally have my Blood Sugar and Blue Blood Palette and saving for the next palette especially Conspiracy Palette Iconic. I still misses the old days of jeffreestar reviewing make ups and stuff but I'm happy that he feels more grounded and feel him self even more with the Yaks what would I ask for. Thank you Shane for this video it means a lot! 🥰 🇵🇭
Everytime Jeffree released a palette he said: WOOOOOOOOO! haha I love Jeffree 💜
Wow…. But in a good way
I love Jeffree sm. I can’t believe he’s quitting.
Reunited and feels so good ❤
It would be so sad for him to stop YouTube. I have watched all of you since you started, through the cancelation and after. I love daily vlogs and hearing about your lives. You’re the only ones that I still have YouTube for😊 I never cared about what the media said because I enjoyed you guys and felt that I knew who you were on the inside through all of that❤
It's probably so nice for Jeffree to just go out and about in town and not have anyone recognize him or treat him like a celebrity. He finally realized what matters in life. ☺️
I'm speechless, anda sad but I just want Jeffree to be happy.
It makes me so happy to see you and Jeffree together again!
he still gets 1-2 millions views on every video which for YouTube is still alot of people watching I could totally understand if he wanted to quit because it genuinely didn't make him happy anymore but the way he's complaining about not getting enough views seems so ungrateful especially after all the controversy I'd be grateful to still have views at all
We love you and support you shane!
I'm saddened to hear the news but I get it. Good for you Jeffree in finding peace and happiness 💛
As someone who isn't on TikTok and who won't ever get it, I'm so sad. Youtube is the only way, other than Instagram, that I keep up with Jeffree :(
I’m happy you both have each other! You both together, create love, respect and mutual support, and positivity ! I love 💕 seeing Jeffree carefree and happy and so down to earth. Loving the yak’s and acreage!
The love they share is so nice to see. Especially when they've been used and disposed of by "friends". I'm glad to see both Shane and jeffree living happy lives. We love you and we missed you. I definitely wait for a notification that either of you posted. Your content does mean something. We're still here. Just waiting for you. ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤❤
I watch YouTube every day. I've only just got Tiktok and I don't use it to look at videos, I just post stuff about my cats. I don't know if this is an age thing because I can imagine people 10 years younger than me are all about Tiktok etc but for us almost 30 year olds +, YouTube is still relevant 😂 I totally understand growing and moving on but I really hope this doesn't become a trend because that'll be really fucking sad.
I so would love to have a  👛 from Jffrey
Idk why but him saying that broke my heart I felt like Shane was so hurt and sad by it
Love this video but damn you changed the name of the video ? Lol it said retirement of Jeffree
Awe I’m going to miss Jeffery I’m love him
I go home to watch Youtube, but I'm an old dinosaur like you guys. 🙃
Shane is back in his series, Jeffree is potentially quitting YouTube... Both makes me in tears
I still watch youtube
love that Jeffree is so happy but him leaving Youtube just broke my heart 🥺 But you gotta do what makes you happy and good for him for making that call for himself ❤️ Shane this series is so emotional and I just thank you for bringing us along for the ride. I love ALL of you guys and am just so blessed to be a part of this. (Also please don't ever leave Youtube 😂 You're one of like 3 people that always cheer me up when life is tough)
i will always watch your videos please keep going!
I'm still watching. Tell Jefree .
Always love the energy of Shane and Jeffree. Shane I think Jeffree is daring you to find a Ghost.
There are beauty creators out there that would love to get even 100 views and you're sounding a little ungrateful
I literally can’t express enough how much joy Shane Dawsons YouTube videos brings to me! I get so excited every time I could watch him forever! I love Jeffree and him together it’s a match made in heaven! I just hope Shane never stops making content here on YouTube I’ll cry😢 YouTube is everything to a lot of us still! I love you Shane!!!! So happy and excited for this!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Shane if you quiet its over for me X_X  Then Markiplier and Matpat will be my only reason to be on YouTube
I consume insane amounts of youtube, but when jeffree said it, it did make sense, people are consuming content differently.. if anything Jenna marbles saw it before so many of us, and left way ahead of everyone.. I was expecting a lot more views on shane's first video.. so he's not wrong about the viewership dip, but I do think it's because of content saturation. The reason I'm not jumping on tiktok is because I'm not comfortable with that kind of speed and instant gratification. it's just not for me.. but here i am at 2 am watching the shane video because I won't want to miss out on the quality.
YouTube is not dead shane don’t listen to him. It’s true nobody’s wants to click Jeffry’s make up videos anymore, no shade no tea, but your videos are different and people enjoy the journey you create.
you guys crack me up, Jeffree and you made my day !! I couldn't stop laughing, amazing energy.
Feel like YouTube is a connection to every influencer tik Tok gives us a lil glance of influencer ❤ very excited for the other videos sad Jeffrey is leaving YouTube
just the thought of Jeffree mowing down a bunch of burglars with a P90 is so freaking satisfying
I still have my conspiracy pallet it’s still my most favourite thing to have purchased 🎉
That’s interesting how Jeffree said that about YouTube. I just said to someone the other day how I have all of the streaming services, but that I still watch YouTube way more than I ever watch Netflix or HBO or Disney+. I love YouTube!
Im still here on Youtube everyday, but I can see where hes coming from ❤️
I watch more YouTube than anything else... Wow 😂
So is jeffree Star a transgender or just feminine male? Does he have a boyfriend or girlfriend? Never seen them before but he seems like a really good person.
It breaks my heart that social media pushed Jeffree to feel that no one cares or watches anymore. Im an old head. I've been A1 since day one for both Jeffree and Shane. However I do understand growth. Despite whatever endeavours for all parties I will still be purchasing palettes and listening to Shane on the pod❤
We love you both together. I wanted the conspiracy palette so bad and of course I never got it...no Jeffree don't quit YouTube I watch and I care
“I feel like it would open a portal to hell.” “We already did that..” 😂😂😂
I love this it feels like we all got invited to Jeffrees to meet up and hang out lol
People need to  stop the hate.. people are flawed so chill.. the ones who can forgive and say sorry are the best people alive. We love u shane... but this video of labeled as the retirement of Jeffree and it shook me
We need Jeffrey on Rumble.  Sell your meat, man!  Everyone would like the yaks.  We are mostly nice people who hate the U-Boob regulations or have been kicked off the platform.
Love this!! ❤️
I am shooketh
I'm happy Jeffery is just living life ✨️ and chill 😎 😌 and being genuinely happy
No no no no….I’ve done nothing but watch youtube since the start of the pandemic, I watch it more than anything!!!!  I don’t even have a Tic Tok acct.  Is that how you even spell it?  Who cares about 30 second shorts???  Keep ‘em coming Shane and Riley!!
Wow feel Shane's sadness over JS and YT 💦😥
Idk if I could live like that . Literall  nothing for miles. Or people . I’d be scared af lol 😂
I'm heartbroken to hear that Jeffrey is quitting YouTube but I'm so happy to see him doing so well ❤️
the way Shane can so easily create a suspanceful line while not looking so obvious… epic skill
I loved this so much! ❤ I’m so happy
This series is amazing so far! I'm loving every second of it. I'm so happy that you and Jeffree are in better places mentally, you all seem so much happier and in better places than you were before. Can't wait for part 3 🥰
Such comfort in seeing Shane trrreeeending again. Love it !if you only knew shane and Ryland....we love you like family
It’s so weird still seeing you in Denver lol in the airport I e been in a zillion times 🤣
God yesss this video makes me feel so happy it’s been so long since I felt this much excitement since the conspiracy pallet series ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Jeffree: I almost died in a car accident  Also Jeffree two seconds later: here’s my car as a roller coaster  🤣🤣🤣 I love his energy
I care about tube😩
#YouTubeSucks
I like traveling… just not with Elton John 😂
You need to do preorders for the palette.  We need it!!! ❤
People are so pressed by these two, why can't everyone accept that they are human, they make mistakes, why should they apologize, to whom? We're just bystanders and we don't know anything about them, if they're happy and everyone involved moved on, why can't the bystanders?  People just wants someone to hate
well jeffree star makeup is no longer vegan idc what anyone says
I’m living for Jeffree right now. So happy for him and happy of his life❤
Both Jeffree and Shane helped me get through so much, so SOO happy to see them again together, and Im so happy theyre living their best lives. As for the leaving YouTube 😭 all my heart menders are leaving and it's so sad, and I can't/don't have tik tok 😢 what is this world turning toooooo please don't go
Jeffree was always stunning but now he looks so genuinely relaxed and happy it’s beautiful to see. I’m so glad all of you guys can rebuild ❤️❤️
Can I say how relaxed jeffree looks, and they all just feel like they haven’t left each other.❤️❤️ I love seeing these guys together
You know I thought jeffree was being over the top saying "no one watches YouTube anymore" but the I was just looking at the veiws from his videos from 3-4years ago...14M,15M, 25M..and his most recent only has 500,000 views. It makes me so sad 😞 I watch every video he puts out
We want the fucking palette!!!!
I am so proud to see how far Jeffrey and Shane have become its more humbling love this series defiantly shows a whole new side and i love it <3 i will always love youtube i watch it every day
I love your friendship with Jeffree so much, it makes me smile. I was been watching the both of you on YouTube since I was in middle school, this is crazy. I wish the both of you nothing but happiness.
I love YouTube. But then again I'm old lol
There are real fans of YouTube and you and Jeffree that want you on YouTube.
I watch youtube all day every day/night. I am hoping once I start dialysis I can bring my laptop with me to watch youtube while getting treatment. I watch Jeffree every time he releases a new video. Shane I also watch both yours and Rylands videos. I watch from the time I wake up at random hours of the night/morning/afternoon. I have my tv on with the volume down due to the fact I am watching random and subscription videos.
A week felt like five years! I’m so obsessed 😍 ❤
Is it not weird to anyone else that Jeffrey keeps his Yaks as pets but also sells yak meat and … eats them…?
What no more make up or YouTube
This video is so good for the soul. Also sad..it’s the end of an era..but it still feels good. Love you guys ♥️
Jeffree’s accent now❤️😊 I can tell he’s so happy
Sad to see him leave, I’ve watched him since I was little glad he’s finally in a happy place🫶🏻
I have a white Jean jacket too If it ever got stained I would tye dye it same as my white skirt
But we are here and we click 🥲
Love love love seeing them together again ❤
i clda swore this said the retired life of jeffreestar?
Purple yak plushie 🥰💜💜💜
I wish there were more than 3 parts!  It’s just so nice to see you all just thriving 🥰- also BEYOND ME that Jeffree could literally build a town on his ranch with 600 acres😂
I’m loving this !
I always loved Jeffrees content! I still very much watch Youtube everyday! Im 49 and honestly i have those other platforms as well but you will find me here! LOVE YOU SHANE AND RYLAND AND JEFFREE LYNN!
Shane why would you go back to him??
Every launch you did Jeffree I always looked forward to, even though it hurt my husband's wallet! Lol But with all jokes aside you will be greatly missed on here! I have been following you Jeffree ever since you started out on Myspace with your music , all of us will just have to watch you on TikTok, but Long live Jeffree on YouTube!
This video was beautiful.
I think those of us who were in high school + when you started a lot of us still watch YouTube but I can see how the new Gen is taking to TikTok more. I was but I had to stop because it honestly was making me depressed. I love these kind of videos so much more. Sad to see Jeffery stop.
I will keep watching you on YouTube!!! Love this
Very mixed emotions tbh, very happy Jeffree is finally happy n at peace with everything but it'll be a very sad thing to not have a yourube video notification 🔔 saying he uploaded. I love his energy n attitude so much, ppl can talk all the shit they want but come on he's a fucking legend!! Shane, you have been thru so much n you keep coming back from all of it. I wish nothing but the best for you n Ryland!! Lots of love and happy wishes from me to all of you!!
I understand what jeffree is saying about he has literally done it all but I hope this series really shows him how many of us are really on here every day tuning in to what you guys are doing ❤ we love you
I love this so much. Shane has honestly cured my depression. When I’m anxious I just rewatch and relisten to the podcast over and over❤
Now i know where all the pinball machines have gone from Australia 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I mean I split my time between youtube and TikTok but yeah, it definitely skews toward tiktok. I pop on YouTube when my favs post.
At the beginning of this video there was 6,000 likes I just got to the end of the video and there's 15,000 likes so in this short hour 9,000 people have watched your video. I can't say YouTube is not in anymore it might be on its way out but it's still working for you Shane! Correction: 18,000 not 15, 000 😳
My hometown!!
It’s so weird being from Wyoming and watching this but I love that Jeffree knows all the Wyoming humor ❤
I like Jeffreys face like this. Handsome
Shane with the pistol would be my reaction if someone handed me a g*n as well. The blood literally left his entire upper body. A mood lol
R U FREAKING KIDDING ME...HIS VIDEOS ARE EVERYTHING!!!!!!.. LITERALLY WHAT I WATCH EVERY DAY/NIGHT..HIS VIDEO IS LITERALLY THE LAST THING I SEE WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES N THE FIRST THING WHEN I OPEN THEM.. DEFINITELY WILL BE MISSED!!😢🥺😢🥺😢😭😭😭😭😭..I HOPE YOUTUBE HAS A COMEBACK AND HE RETURNS WITH IT..HE SEEMS SO AT PEACE WITH LITERALLY EVERYTHING..
Glad to see you guys again, Im glad to see you guys in a better space, and im glad to have one last series to finish off this amazing chapter, maybe possibly get a new palate. But overall thank you for getting me through my sophomore year. Im now in college watching and its amazing to see both of u together one last time. 💗
Jeffree can quit youtube but youtube is NOT dead, and you and Ryland better not quit.  I love watching your channels and click asap all the time before any other vids in my playlist. ❤❤❤
This video feels so nostalgic to me. I loved watching Jeffrey years ago because he’s a makeup genius
Noooo it cant be true im 😢 crying jeffree was everything in the makeup world ! Does that mean no more pallets? We will never see jeffree again? I feel like he’s died
Ps I also bought a farm nothing as lavish just a old 100 year old 3 bedroom farmhouse on 10 acres.
Honestly you will always be the reason I have YouTube on my phone. Yes we don’t know each other in real life 🤣 but you have had such an impact on my life. I grew up watching every video of yours. When it was your characters. When you did parody music videos (which please do again 🤣 no one is doing those anymore). Your food videos, even when I could feel your heart wasn’t really in it anymore. You didn’t give up, you’ve been through so much in life and look at you now. The creativity in your documentary videos is just outstanding. I get so happy every time you post. Just know that you have changed peoples lives, you have helped people through their worst of times. I cannot wait to keep watching you grow in life. I’m so happy for you ❤
Omg I love when you upload, makes my day even better! ❤
Nooo I watch the videos Jeffreeeee. Don’t quit YouTube 😭 💔 I’m sad already 😭😭 one of few channels I have my notifications on for. The beauty community will never be the same 😭
I’m sorry but I can’t get over when Jeffree said “eYAKtly” 😭😂😂
I am so in awww of these two together…also Jeffree looks so healthy I love that 🥹 just to further elaborate I got sad at the end because I genuinely enjoy watching YouTube🥺
wtf is this
Omg Shane relate so much hyperhidrosis 🤗🤗 lots of love to every one
They say money can’t buy happiness and Jeffree shows that. You can have all the Birkins, big cars and mansions but you have to find happiness in yourself. He’s found that at his ranch and he no longer seeks it from material things
Wow. He is a totally different person with the same humor. Love this version of Jeffree 🥰
Jeffree said 2 more videos,  and this was right before the star wedding collection came out, and there have been a few more releases since, so what's that mean for his channel? He hasn't uploaded a goodbye video...🤷🏼‍♀️
OMG SHANE!! your house is absolutely gorgeous!! i’ve been watching you for 6 years at least, and i’m very proud and blessed that you’re getting better!!! also it’s wonderful that you guys are having a baby!! that’s just so amazing!! im super happy that you’re starting another series again and be passionate about it!! love you shane❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yuhh
So many creators feel the same way. YouTube didn't care about the people who made them billions or the watchers. Let's face it and nobody cares about our elders anymore and YouTube is an old man.
Jeffery genuinely seems different in a good way. I’ve always supported him to be honest. He’s very inspiring xoxox
I have a suggestion create your own streaming channel. People pay to watch.
I only use YouTube for my kids and Shane !!
Um YouTube is literally mostly what I watch though! Lol
I still love YouTube HA! Also I feel like I already want the part 2 palette with the shades I've seen, you did great!
Honestly I get what Jeffrey is saying about YouTube but I think OGS like myself who grew up watching you both do still watch it but this generation now is not about it which sucks! It’s all Changing and I’m not here for it😂 nothing I love more is on a night after putting my lil girl to bed I’d scrolling on you tube to see you all and if there is a new video I’ll still be here in years to come❤
I care about YouTube :(
Shane, this is brilliant!  Im really enjoying this series... Good job kiddo!  xoxo Randolph
It ended really sad...
Omg Jeffree, I will miss you on YouTube sooooooo much!!!! I still watch, hell I'd take YouTube over TicTok any day!!!! This makes me so sad😭😭😭😭 but if it makes you happier then you gotta do what you gotta do. Shane I'll still see you on YouTube right? I hope so❤❤❤
Shane you probably will never see this comment but I've supported you since I was 12. A few years ago I found out my Aunts husband (technically my uncle) is Ryland's uncle. Their names are Joyce and Dewey McAllister. So that means Ryland, Morgan and I share cousins! I was a huge fan of you and I thought that was so cool what are the odds? That made it particularly hard to see you go through the cancellation process and while I don't agree with everything you've done I realize it's not my place to judge anyone. I will always support you Shane and I'm happy to see you coming back. 💖 I hope one day you see one of my comments or one day I can meet you.
honestly jeffree and shane reuniting brings me so much joy and the thought of having more “funniest jeffree and shane moments” on youtube is the best thing 😭😂
I agree, I stop watching Youtube
Noooo jeffreeee come back 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Idk why people are hating on Shane and this series? I mean this is the exact same content Shane has made forever, I watched it all and it was fine…. Cancel culture needs to die already.
I think one more make up journey so Shane can make a baby happy with more money to retire on Jeffery be happy not depressed but if that's what you want people still watch guys they do
Love you Shane, keep putting vids out ❤
Loving this so much ❤
😢 I still love YouTube lol it’s my main form of entertainment
Why is Jeffree still lying about never having drank alcohol before?? It’s weird.
I have grandparents and cousins that live in Wyoming
Jeffree taught me how to do make up when I didn't have a mother to help me. Please don't leave us Jeffree 💕🙏   Shane liked my comment I'm gonna cry!! 😭😭😭
Ummmmm excuse me. I WATCH YOUTUBE EVERY DAY
All of your videos always loop me in. I will never stop watching whatever you both put out. So talented in so many ways 🥰
I am still watching YouTube every day for a good amount of time. I watch every video of Jeffree's. I wish he would post more and stay on YouTube 😞
That hurt a little too much. I look forward to my favorite creators posting. It’s like waiting for the next tv episode come out. I just enjoy watching you all post things you enjoy doing. For someone who lives in a small town in Northern Minnesota, a lot of the culture of the rest of the United States comes from you guys. I had no idea it was okay to highlight to the gods until Jeffree said so. He made me come out of my comfort zone and just enjoy makeup for the art of it. I choose YouTube over tv every single day, and I will be so incredibly sad when my favorite creators are done. But I also don’t want to see my favorite creators miserable just to make content. I still routinely watch your old videos especially when you went MIA for awhile. I also routinely watch Jeffree’s and Jenna Marble’s old videos. Shane your videos have brought me out of some of my darkest days. Thank you for making this series.
I’m so freaking sad :( at least Jeffree is still making content on tiktok (: YouTube has been such a safe place for me for years! I can’t even process loosing more creators on here 🥺 please Shane never stop making documentaries & videos 💕
Jeffree just has grown so much and he’s right you tube isn’t what it used to be and he’s done everything possible I just don’t want it to end
So glad you're back I will be bingeing all your videos just like I have for the last 10+ years 🫶
Jeffree happy is all we want but there are us who only have YouTube. I'm devastated i won't get to watch vlogs and launches of new pallettes . please don't leave us all the way
7:14 🤣🤣🤣
That's not true....I'm still always on YouTube...I'm not sure who he's talking to but most ppl I talk to watch YouTube daily 🤷‍♀️
That's so sad. 😭 It's heartbreaking to hear Jeffree say he thinks YouTube is dead. I watch it everyday. I don't enjoy TikTok at all. It's alright but I like watching you and Ryland and Jeffree and Emma. I think you all should get together and launch your own new app.
Literally have a warm fuzzy feeling watching this I missed it so much  I love you guys so much ❤ to growth ❤❤❤
sooo happy for thiss
Pleàse don't stop these videos/series. So many of us appreciate them I'm almost 31. A mama and. Wife, cats and dragon mama too. I appreciate all you do. You're so creative.
Great Video
I really only come to youtube for Shane
I was a little surprised by this, not gonna lie. Though I feel that there is a little bit of..."extra" thrown on for the camera, I legitimately feel that Jeffree's feelings towards YouTube were sincere, to the point where I got a wee bit emotional when he was saying that it was time to "hang up his button"- the facial expressions, tone of voice, lack of eye contact...I believe that there is true feeling to what he is saying. I almost want to say disappointment, but that might not be the right word to embody all he is experiencing. 😔  We are in for an interesting ride, for sure!!!! Super curious for what's coming next!
It’s so amazing seeing you and Jeffree and Ryland back together again. Watching y’all Made me forget that I’m experiencing such a bad bout of seasonal depression. So much so that when the video ended I got sad because I wanted more. It’s upsetting that jefree wants to leave YouTube but he has to do what is right for him. I absolutely love all of u and u guys, (ryland, Chris, Morgan, Lindsey and jerrod included) all have helped me so much these past few years. I have never been a commenter but I have been trying to comment on ur videos because I really want y’all to know how much good y’all do for me!! Thanks so much for caring and sharing!!❤️💜
Jeffree looks AMAZING
Awww I will miss Jeffree.....but I am so glad to see the happiness in him now!
Am I going insane or did the title say "retired" instead of "new" world a few hours ago? I'm really sleep deprived so the possibility of me hallucinating this is highly likely but thought I'd ask anyways lmfao
There were so many times during this video I couldn't help but smile while watching
Say what you want about Jeffrey but he's lived like 10 lifetimes and has amassed so much wisdom and strength! Every decision he makes turns out to be the correct one
omg, jeffree had me cracking up. i'm going to miss his videos. 😢
I agree with Jeffree no one really uses YouTube unless they’ve watched someone for a long time, I only watch Shane’s YouTube majority of the time.
I love you Shane and Jeffrey! Anything that makes you happy makes us true fans happy!! 💜💜💜💕
Yes, I seriously miss the old youtube community vibes. Nothing has been the same in years. I miss real collabs where people didn't care about your numbers as long as you stood for the same values and could all come together and create something that couldn't of been otherwise.
We’re still clicking don’t leave Shane!!
I know I just watch YouTube so does my daughter. A majority of my fave creators are leaving. That my makes me sad. But I will keep watching as long as I have at least one creator on here that I like.
I really love how much you both look after each other and I can’t express how much your friendship (weirdly I guess lol) means the world to me. As someone who relates to you and Jeffree in SO many ways it’s unreal, I love you both so much and I can’t thank you both enough for being such a huge light for me in such dark times, it’s like you always know when to release content to pull me back into reality! As a supporter and fan of you for like 10 years now, I love growing and learning with you, learning new passions, finding new love, new friendships, learning from mistakes, thank you for being human and for weirdly being my friend through the screen all these years 🤍
Shane will totally do the second Shane pallet
It made me said to hear Jeffree say no one cares or watches YouTube cause I still do 😢  I must be the minority… 😢
The Yaks are just living there lives until they end up on someone's plate. ~Jeffrey Star~ 🤨 That makes me sad.
are they making another pallete
Glad that you two are still going no matter what trials and tribulations you’ve been through. Love you guys.
I disagree, I love the you tube longer format. Tik Tok drives me to seizures, lol.
Shane and you draw people in  together and we all watched you. You guys are loved from nanny Star blue mountains Australia 🦘
Wait my girl Jacq no fuckin way
I’ve been watching Star since I was in middle school. I’m glad he found his peace and wants to finish YouTube but it’s also very sad to see him go. 😢😢❤❤❤
What wait I still watching YouTube I hate tik tok. Where I'm gonna see Jeffrey 😫😫😫😫
Shane again trying to act like he isn’t wealthy.
I like kinda knew this was coming from Jeffree about quitting YouTube even still I'm truly gutted!!! Other than for Shane Jeffree is literally the only other reason I click onto YouTube anymore, he's 100% tru tho YouTube is dead in the water at this point, o used to spend so much of my free time watching YouTube but now i barely watch, gonna miss all your content Jeffree
I watch YouTube everyday, every blunt lol
Jeffery and Shane are the epitome of learning and growing into a better human.
I'll always go to YouTube. Just not for makeup or tutorials. Would love Jeffree Star reality.
Why is Wyoming cheaper than Oregon???? 😭😭🤣
I'm here for a paranormal investigation with Shane, Ryland, Jeffree and Morgan!!!
Seeing how Jeffree is living his life now and is so happy and peaceful I think that’s what it’s all about… makes me happy to see him like that
I love Jeffery’s Arcade ❤🎉
Youtube doesn't suck. I love watching your videos!
So happy to see you and Jeffree back at it again!  <3
Im missing the podcasts but I’m enjoying this series too. Thank you for staying on YouTube. I won’t stop watching you.
It’s true YouTube is dying I missed you guys and it’s sad Jeffree won’t be on anymore
I can’t believe the ending 😮 I understand YouTube isn’t what it use to be & Jeffery is a busy business person who can’t waste his time but it’s still shocking.. YouTube won’t be the same without him, he’s one of the O G creators that paved a path for others to follow. Although he’s worked so hard & deserves to retire one of his many jobs. In a bittersweet way I’m happy for him, sad for us.
Don't leave..... instead of beauty can we get star ranch vlogs 🥺
I love how raw and truthful J is. Cus he’s right. The masses don’t matter
i need someone to confirm if jeffree has a godzilla pinball machine omg
Omg I’m literally gonna cry I love hummers so much
Im still watching YouTube BUT I have changed what I see… I used to watch makeup videos religiously but then that community started getting toxic because it was always a competition and I stopped watching… now all I watch is literally one family vlog channel, one travel vlog channel, Shane’s clogs and book videos.. that’s it..
Instead of the arcade its the yakade 💅
Still here watching for enjoyment every day...
Anyone else notice the name of the video went from “the retirement of Jeffree star” to “the new life of Jeffree star“. Hmmmmmmmm 🤔😵‍💫
I love every time Shane posts
Shane’s series are everything
Damn Jeffrey, you looking FINE!🤩🔥
I want you guys to literally just have a joint YT Channel.. i would watch that shit RELIGIOUSLY
Shane I'm hoping u and Jeffree get some time alone and u can get him to open up he really really cares about u.  u get him to open up when it's just u 2 around. With everyone else he is on his guard all the time. I wish Jeffree all the luck in his new life and I hope he finds someone to share his life with that really loves him. I also wish u the best for ur baby journey things are changing and I'm pleased to be along for the ride xx
I’m loving!!! This !! we missed you guys
The ending of this episode was so sad , it almost made me cry . Youtube is really dying and no one is waching like it used to . It’s heartbreaking 💔
Youtube’s not dead. Just because Jeffree’s channel’s not popping doesn’t mean the platform’s dead. There’s still a thriving beauty community on youtube!
Shane and Jeffers are so awful to ryland I bet he feels trapped and that’s the only reason he’s staying😬
Shane please don’t leave YouTube!!! 😢 I literally raced home from work to heat up dinner, pour some wine, cozy up on the couch to watch this. Don’t go 🥺
I’m still clicking… parts of this made me so nostalgic, thanks for this project Shane.
I am literally insulted when Jeffree said no one cares about youtube. Well, f**k you too then 🤷‍♀️ . So much for turning on a video and hanging out with my favorite creators. I'll die before I get tiktok.
It's so nice seeing both Shane and Jeffree in such a good place mentally and emotionally. I'm still holding out hope for the next pallette!!
Well Jeffree was right..... Shane used to get a millon+ or more in an hour of uploading. It's 146k right now at almost 2 hours.
I missed this from YouTube. I'm just genuinely laughing and crying and GAGGING. Move in together please, raise the yaks and your children together, and film every minute. PLEASE.And if there is an advertisement here, I don't care. I will buy everything. ❤️❤️❤️ Keep doing it.
Alright, I’m out. Took a while but I can’t stand the format, all the pointless stuff. It’s only for Shane Stan’s, not fun for anyone else. I was 5min in and skipped to the part where they happened to be getting to the house and talking about the biz, so the last 5-10 min. That’s really all the vid needed to be lol. Didn’t watch the middle because, as I said, just can’t anymore. So long and pointless. So, maybe I’ll watch a few more videos like I did today, first and last few minutes, but Hopefully Shane follows Jeffrees lead and just stops. Had a lot of hopes for Shane’s return but seems like the same old stuff and he may never evolve. They had a good thing going til they got cancelled.
Loved this ! Makes me happy you’re back n i look forward to your videos, love you sooo much ! So glad everyone is happy and thriving ❤️❤️❤️
I literally can't imagine a YouTube with out Jeffree Star
I prefer watching youtube videos over tv and steaming services.  You'll be missed, Jeffree.  If it's no longer bringing you joy, then for your sake and sanity, leave it alone.  But,, just know that there are still people out there that prefer to watch videos here than on other sites.  I get that it doesn't amount to much if viewing is down, but we are still out here.
I so love this version of Jeffery, he looks and sounds so much healthier mentally. This Jeffery is more fearless than the old.
I love Shane series I love that he's so honest and just wants people to know this is who he is and it's beautiful aside from all of the last views on Jeffree's videos I watch him still that's what sucks about the whole wave of Tik tok like yes I like TikTok as well. But at the same time that's its own platform I love watching more than 5 seconds of the people I watch on YouTube because I get on a more personable level of Creator versus viewer with tick tock I get face value for 5 seconds. I hate that YouTube is trying to be tick tock because I thrive on watching the people I watch on YouTube after I get done with a hard day of work so I can relax and see the small glimpses throughout the people I watch on YouTube like yes you're not getting as many views but I feel like it also hurts the people that still watch your content as well when you say nobody watches when clearly people do watch it's just not the certain amount of people that used to view your content. As a viewer I appreciate all the hard work you put in each video and appreciate the time you set aside to do one video week or two video but it just makes me so sad to see you guys so disheartened when just like you we all went through a pandemic so of course we have other things that are preoccupied but we still want to watch our favorite creators . I hope I'm not sounding a certain way it's off putting it. Bottom line I love your content I love all the people I watch on YouTube I just wish social media in general including YouTube should stay in their own lane and stop trying to merge together
Jeffrey is not going to be on YouTube anymore. He has decided to kill Yaks and sell Yak meat for the rest of his life!!! Yay!!!
WOW !!!
Omg! Will Jeffree stay on Tik tok & Instagram???? I will really miss him! Hopefully, he stays on one of the platforms.....
10 seconds in and “I’m really scared to see my friends mansion😭😭” please don’t reproduce the world doesn’t need more of even even tho their SOOO much already:)
This series is bringing me back
I was born and raised in Casper. ❤
The name changed? Wasn't this called the retirement of jeffree star?
I've been watching YouTube for years and you and Jeffree from the early days! I'm 30 now and it's like we all went through life together and needed eachother as youtubers and viewers/fans! So sad to see him go! Shane please don't quit 🙏 x
As long as Jeffree is happy and he LOOKS genuinely happy.. then I don’t blame him. I truly couldn’t if I tried. Like he said, he’s done it all. &If he’s not into it anymore then no one should expect him to stay. All it would be is him forcing himself and that would make him so depressed and unsatisfied. Screw that 💖
He's right honestly. Even Youtube is moving more into Youtube Shorts and pushing that even more than long form content. (Even though I live for long form D;)
I’m crying my eyes out omfg
They didn’t let u use code GROWER this time?
Omg, aww.. Jeffree.. I miss you on YouTube though.. 🥺
Where is part 3 😭
Nobody’s clicking anymore…. Consistently gets a million views per video.
I have been watching Shane's content since 2008 and it always feels like coming back to watch a long-time friend.  So happy to see you happy Shane!
The way the first notification with the original title spoiled me the big reveal... Aaaah 😩 Still happy you're back shane
Omg it makes me so sad that YouTube is dying!! I love watching videos and seeing what people create on here!! SHANE DONT LEAVEEE
loved it so much!!! felt like old times to be laughing with you guys again🥹🥹 can’t wait to see the rest of the series
The Georgia Bulldogs flags in Wyoming! What!? 😂
Honestly Shane and Jeffers have such a huge energy it’s really chaotic and I’m HERE for it
The growth here is amazing and I love to see it!
Obsessed & have missed this!!! I love you guys so much! This is what real friends looks like. And jeffree, so fckn proud of you. LA is toxic and you got away! Yes!
it's nice to see jeffree officially at peace, couldn't be prouder of him <3. he deserves it, he really really does. :> i hope he continues to uphold to his boundaries <3.
I know Jeffree thinks YouTube is dying but it really isn’t . I’d rather watch YouTube than a show or movie ANYDAY . In fact I do watch YouTube every day . YouTube is my comfort and always has been . But I completely respect and understand why Jeffree would leave YouTube . As long as he’s genuinely happy 💗
Shane my friend… you’re such a creative mastermind!! I love your edits!! It’s like a movie!! You’re an amazing human Shane! Stay happy stay confident stay humble!💜
I think Jeffree is deflecting bc his channel started getting less views… it’s not the case for everyone on YouTube though. Has to do with so many ppl canceling him
I basically ONLY watch YouTube. No Netflix, disney Plus, Amazon prime and I am also not on tiktok. Suspended my instagram account to live life being more present.  I Will not stop watching YouTube
I'm so sad to hear Jeffree is quitting YouTube. I've been following him for the 20 years he's been on YouTube. I do agree about people don't come home and watch YouTube like they used to. I feel like the same content is being made but Jeffree's content always made me so happy.
Ok next series ghost hunting with Jeffrey star. I’m down to watch that! 😂❤❤
YouTube is NOT dead! FYI! 🤷‍♀️😔
plot twist: these are jeffrees last two videos
I been here since “the retirement of Jeffrey star” 😂😂😂
I can’t believe J Star is gonna quit YouTube.  Nooooooo! Thank you for these videos Shane. ❤
Loving this! Theres something special about Shane and Jeffree together.
I have to see Jeffrey is a total different person (in a good way) he look so at peace. And also shane i wish the both of you the best
Loving the series so far.  Catching myself smiling at the moments you share together. Sad that Jeffree is leaving the platform but ultimately you have to do what makes you happy. Just know Shane you make us happy and are bringing joy 🇦🇺😃
But we watch Shane and Ryaland! It gives me peace and joy. Maybe for Jefree does not make sense anymore
I love you so much Shane I’m so proud of you!!!!!!♥️♥️♥️💕💕💕💕
Way better than the news today
I still watch YouTube lol 👀
There’s something different about Jeffree, he deff seems much happier and idk what it is but its a positive thing. He just looks brighter
Im so happy that my boys are back, I've missed you both so much!
I watch YouTube!!!!
Mwuah💋
WOW < I was glued to my IMac. This was a sensational video. It was all portrayed so well.. I laughed and smiled and felt some sadness. I cannot wait until part 3. Shane you should make a hoodie with some leopard print. I want one of those MTV shirts that you wear. I loved seeing Jeffree again and am glad hw is happy.
Not Jeffery driving 80 mph lol 😆
GIRL I WATCH YOUTUBE FOR FUN WHAT
I only watch YouTube.. I still watch for enjoyment.
😢 the end is sad and hate that JS is leaving
Oh…. He is touching a sensitive ground 😭
Y’all look so damn beautiful!!! 😍😍😍
what jeffree said about youtube is so true and so sad. I miss the old youtube, i have spent like 10 years falling asleep watching youtube. I feel like with the new age of tik tok, reels etc people have no patience for youtube, its like our brains can only take in 30seconds of content. its sad
Wishing you all the best of luck! 👏🍀
Yeeeeeee. I’m so excited to see you and Jeffree together again!
Say what you will about him but Jeffree Star has impeccable timing. If he is leaving social media it's with more money than he will need to live the rest of his life doing whatever fulfills hiim. He is still young enough to start many new ventures and I'm certain he will continue to hold our interest.
I watch YouTube alllll the time .
I still use YouTube to watch videos and I’ll miss you if/when you leave Jeffree.  I’ll support you regardless. ❤
Love how long this video is
I waited 47 minutes to watch this because my food wasn't done cooking. It was painful, but I needed snacks for this🤌🏼
jeffree can't quit youtube ;-;
I'm loving this so much ... and I still care 🙋‍♀️🥰
Balance The Volume In The Video Next Time!
Wow! Jeffree’s decision hit me and made me think are we that old? Is this the end of this era? What happened? Time moves so fast. I’ve got really emotional 🥲
Wow!!!!! This was great!!!!! I do have to agree with Jefferey everyone is on TikTok now.
I don't care how much hate I get by saying this, bit I hope they get it together and release that makeup pilot,I really want those colors....🤩🥰
completely baffled. I'm so happy to see him so happy but damn I will miss him. this series is BEAUTIFUL so far 💕
WHOA!!! WHAT?!? Can't wait for the next!
Thanks for taking us along for the ride, Shane❤️ had fun watching this!
No way! Jeffree can't leave youtube. I watch his video's often.
So happy to see Jeffery grow and let go of his materialism.
i'm gonna be devastated if Youtube goes down the drain. Youtube is my way of enjoyment, entertainment, and education. it's always my go-to when i get on my laptop to watch something.
I still watch YouTube for you guys 😭 I feel like when Jeffrey said that no one watches anymore, the look on Shane’s face was like him questioning everything. I love all of you ❤ seriously was a 55 minute break from hating my life 😅
ok but jeffree has always been so fucking funny
Jeffree has never looked healthier and happier. It’s all about balance ☯️
Really miss all od these videos and going to haunted places...a day in the life I miss it all...I still think yall are amazing 🙏💜💚
PLEASE DO A GHOST WYOMING SERIES WITH JEFFREE T-T <3
love Shane but so over Jeffrey
I still watch like 4 hours of YouTube a day and I work full time 🙈
I still watch YouTube daily I don’t think it’s dead 😢
I needed the title changed I like this one better
This video makes me so happy! Until the ending 😭😭😭
that truck looks soo fun lmaoo....
I don’t think the last bit was true, maybe for Jeffree but Shane your definitely not wasting ur time
Im so happy for the series! 💞
I am not obsessed with the timeliness of the video, I don't sense either of you changed. These videos definitely transport me back to 2019.
Not me just finishing this video after it was called the retirement of jeffree Star and now I’m done watching it’s called the new world of jeffree star lol I see what you’re doing Shane 🧐
I mean Jeffree is not wrong, youtube has been going downhill but I still love watching my fave YouTubers, and I enjoy your stuff Shane, I've been watching you forever, so every time you've been "cancel" I'm like what now? but I enjoy watching your stuff and Ryland's stuff and Morgan and I can not wait to see the rest of this series
I'm loving this series Shane!! It's been real nice to get a glimpse into your current living situation. Plus, of course seeing Jeffree& how he's been doing has been amazing also!! I'm really bummed out though to hear Jeffree is going off YouTube. His channel has always been a favorite of mine to watch! I love seeing the makeup, the wigs, the whole transformation that Jeffree is so good at doing. Of course I can completely understand his reasonings for leaving, it's just a bummer.  Before this gets too long, thank you for doing this series Shane!! Thank you Jeffree for allowing Shane to document more of your story. I'm always so intrigued to know how you're doing!  ✌️💜
Why did you change the title?
Nooo, this is so heartbreaking.. sadly tho, it is so true. 😭 I watch YouTube every single day for hours but I have noticed how rarely people upload anymore, and it is heartbreaking. I don’t WANT some shortened instant gratification garbage to watch, I love sitting back after a long day and watching a full video with talented editing and actual substance. Even YouTube shorts annoy me, I NEVER watch them because what is the point? And it seems like everyone is either posting shorts or just posting on TikTok… It’s so sad to hear that Jeffree will be leaving YouTube.. 😢  I’m so glad that Shane is at least still carrying on with series.. We love that. I’ve missed this so much. 😭  On another note, Jeffree mentioning how haunted WY is sounds like a series in itself! Omg, taking Jeffree on some haunted trips would be phenomenal content and I really hope that we can see it and that it inspires Shane even more in the future!!! ❤❤❤
I watch Jeffries videos I watch YouTube for entertainment
Please ask jeffree if I can work for him on the ranch. I will send my resume
Don't ever leave 🥺🥺
Jefffee. I hope you find yourself on this journey of peace and self discovery. Thank you for the joy you brought into my life and so many others. 💕
I'm not ready to move on to TikTok i need more long form content!
Jeffrey can't quit YOUTUBE!!! I don't use tiktok, I don't like it. I love YouTube still lol  No one uses YouTube??? I fucking watch it DAILY!!!!!! All sorts of videos plus YouTube has shorts now. FUCK YOU JEFFREY I've changed my mind I don't care your leaving your YouTube subscribers behind 😭😭🤣
When i say chills… i mean CHILLS BRRRRR BITCH
I still love YouTube!! I watch creators that I love as soon as I get a moment to unwind in the day! I can’t imagine not opening up my YouTube app throughout the day!
“YouTube’s dead literally NOBODY watches it any more …… “  🥺Ummm hi 👋🏻 I’m a figment of Shane’s imaginary views
I always count down the hours until I can watch a new Shane video. Such a genuine person. This world needs more people people like him
The family is back together again!!! I am so happy to see all of you together again . Much Love 🥰🥰
Shane I hope you continue YouTube/doc/film making till your 40 years old
There are so many of us who find safety and comfort in your videos and your podcast. I know for a fact I would not have gotten through this past year without your videos, your podcast, Ryland's vlogs, Morgan's vlogs, Lizze's vlogs, The Sip. You guys matter, what you do on YouTube matters, we care and we are so thankful for you all 💜💜
Jeffree has worked extremely hard to be in a position to be able to spend time doing things that makes him happy, and that is amazing. Fully support whatever makes him happy in life!!! ❤️
The Jefree quitting YouTube “reveal” isn’t as impactful after going to his channel and seeing he posted a video literally two days ago 🤭😅
"Time to Jenna Marbles and do something else" 😭😭😭
I am legit crying. Seeing the growth and change that has come for JS since Covid. The lockdown really changed us all ❤️🥰❤️
I have extreme de ja vu about this moment watching this video. Soo weird! But I’m so happy you’re back!
Not me crying for Jeffree 🥹
No ones watching YouTube? TikTok drives me insane with 'click for part 2' I'm  watching channels that are still growing lol. I'm the same as a lot of commenters here, I watch Shane, Shane2 (with Ryland, Jerad & Chris) Ryland, Rylands vlogs, The sip, Lizzie Gordon, Morgan, Morgan's vlogs. I love the insight in to peoples lives and it helps that I often roar with laughter. My kids, my husband, my family and friends all watch YouTube, I'm a bit late tonight but so far, 50 odd thousand other people watched it too lol xx
I am the opposite.. I don't really like TikTok. I'd rather watch YouTube videos that are longer and show more then a 30/60 section quick clip without any explanation or tutorial behind it. I want to see the whole process.. the longer videos are what get my attention the most.
WHEN CAN WE BUY THAT NEW MAKEUP
Tell Jeffree that I will take anything he doesn’t want, LOL! 👞 💼 🐎 ❤
Nooo now I have to wait another week😢😢love y’all
May or may not have just bought two bags of Yak Jerky 😂😂😂 It sounded too good I Couldn’t help myself ❤
i go on youtube more than anything
Oh, when my Ryland cut J⭐️ off with the comment “8 dogs” you could see it irritated Jeffree so much 💀 Ryland, Jeffree is not going to let you be rude 59 him like you are to Lizzie. No M’am 😅
Favorite quote: “Mandy’s hair is red and I’m a farmer but same hoes!” 😍 😂 HELL YESS!!
Excited!!
Omfg I'm so excited for you guys 😅🤠
Jefree was always beautiful but now even more so, absolutly beaming from within. I loved this so much. you all have such a wonderful vibe
I really love the storytelling in this video. You have us hooked, Shane!
Hopefully this series makes him rethink
Being canceled 10x omg and I still love watching all his videos :)!!!❤❤❤
Wait.. when did jeffree get eyebrows?
Wow… the ending of this shook my core!  I can’t say anything though because I quit uploading like 9 years ago (to my measly 9k subscribers).  This video was FANTASTIC and I enjoyed every minute!  JOB WELL DONE!  👏🏼
When Shane said "I just got here and my life is threatened 7x", I DIED HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA
Weird I looked at Jeffreys view count on recent videos in the first part. I don’t follow them anymore but I definitely view this app daily. The content I view has shifted no doubt. On to bigger a better thing though no doubt! Congratulations 🎉
What a gorgeous doc. Thank you for making content again ❤
Lol he changed it from the “Retirement of Jeffrey Star” to “The New World of Jeffrey Star” within  the first hour.
Love this friendship 💜
JS still gets 1milliom views on videos ...
I guess it's the old school in me but I still very much love watching YouTube and I'm still watching the same youtubers. I get Jeffree's pov though and I just really love where he's at now, where both of you are. It's inspiring. I was watching the first series you did together while I was homeless, recovering from botched brain surgery, living with my abusive af grandpa, same with the makeup launch. I pretty much bought it all though when I finally got approved for disability. Had it shipped to my brother's to keep it safe. Now I'm watching this from my own apartment and it's still packed away never been opened. Waiting for the right moment. I love Jeffree's new mentality about being canceled and cancel culture. Fuck it. I'm so done with it. These blood suckers are out here legitimately killing people with this and bullying us to hate and stop supporting people over shit that's ridiculous and so old and taken out of context. I know I'm over being told wtf to do and if Jeffree Star can be living his best life in Wyoming, we as the human race can find a way to do better and get along despite our differences. I'm here for that. That's the world I wanna live in.
WAIT but I do watch jeffree star videos:( so saaaad
17:49 "come on" 🤣🤣 Jeffree has such a comforting vibe lmao
For what it's worth.....YouTube is my go-to. I have subscriptions to ALL of the streaming services (Hulu, Disney, Netflix, Amazon, Paramount, Discovery etc) With all of the options I have.....I ALWAYS turn on YouTube. No hesitation, or question.... It's always YouTube for me. To be quite honest, I'm going to be devastated that Jeffree is leaving the platform. I'm always watching for his latest videos. I don't use TikTok or any other social media platform. I'm old school and prefer only Instagram (if I have to) I'm super bummed that I'm potentially going to miss out on his latest launches and news. I fully support his decision to move on and better his station in life. Good for him!
It’s YouTube algorithm Jeffree. There are soooooo many channels that once got 500k+ views or more a video. Like this video, I didn’t know it was uploaded. I only knew because I went to the channel.
I was laughing so hard about everything and then…HELLOOOOO EXCUSE ME ! I mean, I don’t even like make up but I watch every video on his channel. Though, his happiness is way more important.
Love the video but Im honestly super upset Jeffree is quitting YouTube
I clicked on this for Jeffree. Not shane.
Whether you like him or not, no one expected to hear Jeffree say that he is leaving youtube. It's like a start to the dying of an era.
I literally loved your guys friendship. So happy to see you guys finally back together.
This was so nostalgic. And I will never stop caring or watching. ❤️
when he said,"I like travelling, just not with,,,,,,ELTON JOHN" referring to ryland in those glasses🤣
I’m so proud of you both!!!
I just love this so much, thank you, thank you ❤
Ok. Jefferee is not retiring. Just stopping YouTube. Jefferee has enough money to run a website for uploads and work other platforms. Its not the end of the world.
I didn't want this video to end!
My heart is in shambles… but I love this duo so much I’m so thankful we get one last series ❤️❤️
I watch YouTube daily ❤Shane don’t you ever leave us too🥹🥹💕
My heart will be broken with Jeffree leaves YouTube. Am I the only one whose on YouTube daily?!?!
Read the title and couldn’t believe it. Watched the video and I don’t want to believe it 😭 this is crazy I watch YouTube more than anything else. I definitely get it though
Well that sucks
That's how me an my best friend are all the time aha all yall are funny 😁
that’s definitely not what I expected...!
But the conspiracy 2 launch will be one YouTube right???? 🥰🥰🥰
I’m so happy rn 🫶🏻💗
JEFFREE STAR I AM NOT A NOBODY! !! I watch you every time you post on YouTube. Lol I know it may feel discouraging but I know for a fact you aren't boring and we will be here for you always. That goes for you too, Shane. Lol. Love you all. Please don't leave lol
Jeffrees views are still good. Is it Shane and Jeffree 2018/2019 views? No. But thats honestly most you tubers views. It’s went down since then all across the board. But most of his recent videos still have at least 1 million + views. That’s still really good.
All I want, is for Jeffree to be at peace, be happy and live his life the way he wants. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotion from the start, and you will be missed by your genuine fans.
i know jeffree said no one watches youtube anymore n no one clicks.. but do not leave youtube shaneeeee, pleaseeee. lmao, your videos n your podcast bring me so much joy
Been watching you since the dam start and I get chills every post you make to this day 🫶🏼 much love Shane always
Shane, I love this so far. Keep it up. Can't wait until the next one. Welcome back
Jeffrey you are doing only reveal on reveals of make up pallettes, people is bored of that not of youtube ...also you and Shane for obvious reasons took some times from it and that make u loose a lot in views and follows...Do something exciting and see how people will enjoy our videos...also with this moves i think u will loose also with the make up brand....people support you especially because of your life on social media ...in a TikTok you can't share notthing deep and the new generations will not know who Jeffrey Star is...Think about this...
I watch! I care!!!
Omg the ending... We're all still watching YouTube!! And enjoying our favorite creators videos :) I could never go without YouTube, doesn't matter how many streaming platforms will come! YouTube (and it's creators) is what a lot of us grew up with and that's something so special<3
I’m so amazed by the growth of these two and especially how Jeffree came down to earth and is finally calm settled and happy. That’s what life’s all about finding that calm and peace within
aww the jenna comment got me in my feels
I really love you Shane and its great to see a comeback you have people who support & love you 🤍
I will always watch YouTube...
So many thoughts & feelings after watching this. Jeffree ending the video saying "YouTube sucks!" was a bit surprising to me, because I ❤ watching his videos just as much as I ❤ watching yours. You both have such magnetic personalities that I'm drawn in to your different worlds that I easily get captivated by. I can't believe there is only 1 more episode, kinda sad but I will watch & enjoy the magic that is Shane Dawson & Jeffree Star🪄
So nice to see y’all so peaceful. And happy. It’s a zen nostalgic feeling and it’s amazing. Also, I think for youtubers to keep up on this platform, people need to elevate their content. Jeffree is right. For example, we don’t need no reviews about mascara that are 15-17 minutes long. We have tik tok. In a few seconds, we know if a product is worth the try. For youtube, to elevate the content is the key. Like this series. And the ones you done before. I prefer to watch an hour long episode of something really meaningful here, than makeup reviews and makeup tutorials. To dive deep in a subject, to get to know people and their realities, to talk about more deep subjects and about life. I really enjoy this type of content 😊 I think as the creators and the audience gets older, the subjects of the videos needs to evolve as well.
love the ep <3 <3
If only TY algorithm wasn't sh*t maybe things would be better. I'm shocked to hear this news but that doesn't mean that's it for Jeffree, TikTok saving us.
Mr.Beast says otherwise
That is so cool aha 😎
God I feel like I've been in withdrawals without you two, three, etc! Love seeing ya'll back together, happy & healing! But if ya leave YouTube I won't get updates.  I'm an old broad who still does YouTube, I don't do Instagram, Twitter or TikTok. In the future send out smoke signals so I don't miss a make-up launch. Love ya'll and never gave up on any of you! Wishing you nothing but happiness!
Jeffree is one of my favorite people in the whole world.
Would love to see a haunted video with Jeffery or even just with the family 💜
I have to say that I still care about YouTube. I watch and unwind at the end of every day.
Ngl, I love jeffree but I thought he left YouTube years ago lmao a little anti climactic for me
“No one clicks on YouTube anymore” I beg to differ😂
Oh god Shane thank you… I just rewatch all of the series and it was… IS amazing. Don’t know if Jeffree right about YT or not, but… I’m living for your videos, old and new ones.   And I have never unsubscribed because of drama and cancellations… It doesn’t matter if the person you subscribed for bringing to you joy and happiness. And it’s about you, Ryland, your dogs… and a baby, of course   Just a two weeks ago I was sitting on my couch and think “it’s been already two years after the Jeffree series. And I want it back so much”. And then boom, here it is.   But it is not an old series, old you and Jeffree, it’s different now. And this is amazing, I love you and Jeffree even more  Shane, thank you, love you ❤
I missed Shane and Jeffree so much!!! I rewatch their vids for comfort 🥹 also, a haunted series with the original unmatched spooky crew with Jeffree? ✨✨
Omg! I love seeing you and Jeffree together again!
Omg jeffree star quiting you tube nooooo I still watch every video he puts out that makes me sad well I hope he puts out a farewell video worth watching
I have come away from this video not only so happy after laughing out loud but sad at the possible loss of such amazing Youtubers. I am already waiting and ready for a Haunted in Wyoming video with you guys! Don't call it quits, YouTube isn't dead 💖
This video is actually really interesting as it mentions the falling of YouTube and the rise of tik tok . Personally I believe that tik tok and instagram reels are fucking up peoples attention span and this is why people don’t watch long form content any more .. thank you so much for a sensational video Shane ❤❤❤❤❤
Background music is at times too loud I cant hear Jeffree's dark voice :/
Awww I'm so sad 😭 Gonna miss you so much. Lots of love from Michigan ❤️
I don’t think YouTube is over…I think the beauty community and the drama community are over.
I hate to hear that Jeffrey is leaving YouTube. He is right that it’s not the same anymore but I always enjoyed his content. Shane and Jeffrey have always been two of my favs. Yes they went through cancellations and drama but I do feel like that have learned and moved past it.
LOOK !!!! IM IN THE DARK AGES.   Y'all!   I still watch YouTube! Ok ok maybe I'm the only one but I'm 55 give a girl a break I NEED YOU ALL !!  IMA CRY NOW !!!!   LOVE Y'ALL FOR REAL
I love you jeffree.  MORE.
I love YouTube! 😭😭
Did anyone else cry a bit?♥️🥺
as much as it sucks hearing that jeffery is quitting youtube, you can tell from this video he is much calmer and peaceful living a more simple life. I wish him nothing but happiness ❤and for everyone saying they "selfishly" want him to keep making videos need to open their eyes and realize he is an actual human being and not a circus monkey here to entertain u. find some new youtubers and leave jeffree's peace alone
You and Jeffree should do some pharanormal content! Would love to learn some spooky things and see some sheit!
make a palette called baby tears pls
I watch Shane and Ryland for enjoyment.    Just saying. . . .
I’m crying jefree what made my day before I found him I tried killing myself because I was nothing but he showed me that u can be anything please don’t leave me jefree u help me out more then you know
I love YouTube.  I love watching Shane's videos I love watching Jeffrees videos. Ughh I know people need to do what's best for themselves but I'm bummed, dare I say..heartbroken that he's leaving 😭
It’s mad a group of peoples opinions can just make somebody feel that bad that they quit.
I'm sorry but Jeffree is wrong. Everyone is watching YouTube. I will watch a YouTube video on my phone before ever turning on the TV
I know Jeffrey got like canceled by the community and all but it is a shame he won't be doing videos I kind of watched his videos for years cuz I'm a big makeup person but if it doesn't give him joy and fulfillment anymore I don't blame him for leaving I personally watch my content creators on YouTube everyday YouTube and Instagram are the only two platforms I use and watch and I wish him luck out in Wyoming and hope that he's happy and I'm glad that he got some clarity and his mental state is stable good luck to him
For the record. I love you tube !!!
I could watch Shane's editing for hours and hours and hours it's so amazing! 👏 👏 👏  I love these series so much 🥺🥺
I’m sorry I love you all but I don’t agree. I’m still on YouTube everyday and I still watch every single Jeffree video. This is an escape for so many of us… to say for who? That no one is watching is just not true ..
Damn Shane has been one of my favorites since high school. Now 26 I’m still watching what he come up with! Loving what you put out! Thanks 🙏🏻
Im glad shane hasnt quit yet. And i watch youtube daily. Been watching youtube since around 2008-2010 time but more casually. Then picked it up after that and its been my daily way of entertainment since.  Im glad the secrets are coming out after so long. Jeffree looks so happy and acts differently now. Shane has been so much happier. Im so glad for them. And im sorry to hear, Shane, that assholes are video taping you in public and shaming you. Id be excited and want to give you a hug.
Nooooooo Jeffree, don't leave YouTube 😢
Did anyone see if before he changed the name ? Wasn’t it the retirement of Jeffree
Seeing Shane and Jeffree interact again makes me so happy! M  But hearing how unhappy Jeffree is with YouTube makes me so sad. I really miss his make up videos :((
Aww jeffree I'll miss your videos ... I get it though, will you still post when you have makeup out?
I am so here for this. Well done Shane
I would absolutely love if Shane and Jeffree had a reality TV show I would watch that religiously lol♥️ I hope and wish the absolute best for you guys what a great series so far!
I watch YouTube every day 😭
I agree with jeffree, but it’s more no one is watching makeup videos anymore! I love watching videos like this now 💚 I don’t watch makeup videos like that anymore! Love you guys
Another hour long video where nothing exciting happens! Cool 😎
Love this! But reduce the background music, more casual vibe would be more relaxing to watch ✨
I love how pure the friendship is… and … how happy you both are after people dragged you … it’s great to see people find themselves thru the storm
When Jeffery’s voice changed at the end when he said he was leaving YouTube my eyes got watery I can’t wait for part 3😢❤❤❤
IM ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED 😭😭😭 why do the good ones leave , also ik that said the retirement of jeffree star why’d you change it 🫣
IM ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED 😭😭😭 why do the good ones leave
This series is EVERYTHING 👏🏻!
Can we appreciate how good Chris is at filming!! I think he made this video look amazing ❤️
the title really ruined the whole video
But imagine (me not having finished the video) if the shane 2 pallets was called the zodiac pallete 👀
Right now the drama channels are scrambling to make a quick video to criticize this episode and make up a few lies about Shane and Jeffree to try and milk some more money from the engagement they will get.
did anyone see that shane changed the title from "the retirement of jeffree star" to the "new world of jeffree star" ?? AND THE THUMBNAIL?!
Happy to see both of you in one frame AGAIN !!!!!! 🤍 my heart 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🥺
I feel kind of sad at what Jeffree said but I understand completely what he means. Me personally I had to get rid of my tiktok app it was so toxic for me mentally and all I wanted to do was waste time on it. But I will always enjoy the content he has already created and I am super grateful for the wild ride! Awesome series ❤❤
I agree with him that he needed a change for his soul. I disagree with the youtube is over part. I watch all the time. If he were putting stuff out I would be watching that too. The issue is all the know it alls telling the masses how to think and feel in a negative way. The world does not need more negativity. The world needs more love. People are here to make mistakes and learn from them. That's life! What we aren't here for is talking shit on other's mistake's. That gets you into nasty painful situations so you can learn you are being an unsupportive ass. Put out the palette bc I love the colors I have seen already. Then let us all learn just how many people were talking shit for the sake of talking shit.
I need you guys to understand that if you end up doing the Shane 2 palette I will buy it so quickly. I love you guys, and you each having a shade in the palette would make me cry. I love you’re friendship, it’s so sweet.
Hi
I don’t want Jeffree to leave😢 this makes me so sad I love you guys so much. Thank you Shane so much for what you’ve done! Not only for my childhood but for me now! You make my shittiest days better I appreciate everything!❤️🌻
Omg 🥺 this made me so emotional. I’m so happy to see you guys together! I’ve been a fan of Jeffree since the MySpace days and I just hope he finds happiness wherever that is , he deserves it more than anyone ❤❤
what to even say, I just miss you guys so much. Jeffree quitting YouTube is so scary cause what if you follow, like everyone I used to watch and love is leaving it’s so sad.
Jeffree using the non-emissions humvee is great. 😂
damn I just installed the addon to see the like ratio. It's at 15k likes vs 2,5k dislikes. The other vid is at 125k vs 100k though. I wonder why though I enjoyed both. Get tf over it ppl
I still care! I watch YouTube everyday after work.
We get one life ....  Do it doing things that make YOU smile.  No matter what that may be
Please don't guit YouTube Shane ever an hope Jeffery the best but I still watch bot of u
Love it ❤️ The music in this is really good too
I want a hummer now
I love this new jeffree❤️
I swear to god Shane you and Ryland better not leave YouTube!  Tiktok has its place but 30 second content is boring as fuck!
i am still in the middle of watching; but i least wanted to remind you that you are loved so very very much! <3 i know the internet can be such a toxic place; but there is also so much good. you do have a lot of people that never stopped loving you, a supportive husband, a supportive family, and supportive GENUINE friends. i really hope this is the year that you are able to love yourself fully, like you genuinely deserve. xoxo also i think chris is a nice addition to the team. he seems genuinely happy, which going off of a comment he made in the last video, i can tell he really needs this, legit friends and support too :3 okay, sappiness speech over :b.
Prove to Jeffree YouTube isn't dead 🖤 I much prefer long form content to short annoying content!
Why did you change the thumbnail and title?
I absolutely love love love the new Jeffrey! Ugh what a beautiful man! P.s. SHANE PLEASE DO A HAUNTED SERIES IN WYOMING!!!!
I love jeffree don’t care what anyone says
I can’t explain the heart break. I genuinely thought kind of the same as Shane at the beginning, that this was going to be a fun video/series where they show the palette and talk about/move on from the past, but hearing jeffree leave YouTube? It’s like the craziest end of an era announcement ever. He has been on YouTube from the beginning and someone I have watched since, literally as long as I can remember. I mean of course he can do what he wants and feels is best, but Jenna marbles leaving literally broke me so to see Jeffree do the same. It’s insane.
Always going to love Jeffree and Shane for the person who they are. I do watch your videos jeffree please don’t leave YouTube. I feel connected to you when you share your videos.  I WISH WE COULD BE FRIENDS ONE DAY.
I just realized I have never seen  Jeffree  without his phone in his hand. I'm glad to hear he's not constantly checking comments. The burden that is off his shoulders releasing all of those possessions must be amazing.
Ahhhh so this is the series to prove to Jeffree we are clicking?  I think ppl are, just not on make-up. Lock downs stopped people going out. You don’t need makeup to stay in.
Honestly, I have to literally search for You, Ryland, and Jeffree. I’m subscribed, have notifications on, but YouTube is a bitch and never lets me know when any of ya’ll upload.😑
I still watch utube! lol Dont stop!!
WOW...
I like his idea about haunted Wyoming...I would love to see a series on that!
Jeffrey reminds me of Tiger King but he’s the Yak King
Moreeeee pls
"let's blow this joint" is a dangerous statement to say in an airport
This video is fantastic! One of your best. Love that ending   It's so cool to see Jeffree as a new person. Glad to see him happy
I'm so happy you guys are back doing a series again thank God
Wow this is just as eye opening as the last series you did..
Omg Jeffree  quitting YT hurts 😭    I always look forward to seeing new videos from Jeffree,  Shane and Rylan 💕 You 3 are my favorite.
Question what song is playing at 4329❤
I freaking love this one
I love seeing you guys together again!! It feels like old times, but better! 💕🥰
Why do we romanticize “loving” someone you’re going to kill? That’s vile and fucked up.
I LOVE Youtube videos and appreciate content creators!
honestly I only come on YouTube to watch Shanes series and a couple of Jeffrey videos. but im so happy for all the success that Jeffrey has done since the last time you guys were together. can't wait for the next video <3
I'm so proud of Jeffery awa my heart ❤️
my jaw on the floor like 😲😲 at the end…. the editing is gorgeous too… chills through the whole episode. So needed this series
There’s no one better than Shane to break the news to us. The class, respect and love he puts into everything he does is beyond words.. Jeffree looked so sad when he said he’s done 😢 He may be done with YouTube but he’ll never leave us!
NICE TITLE CHANGE <3
I really really hope Jeffree stays on YouTube.
I feel so emotional right now after watching this. Jeffree retiring from YouTube makes me sad but I rather he be happy and if quitting YouTube makes him happy then I'll support him. Shane and Ryland never quit YouTube I'll be heartbroken if you do. I can't lose you all like this!😢🥰😶‍🌫🤗 Shane this series is amazing so far, can't wait for part 3!!!
I literally spend so much of my time on YouTube. Has it changed because of the reasons stated..yes.. but that doesn’t mean it’s done. There’s a massive gap for the type of content Shane does. Jeffree seems to have zoned out of social media and that’s totally cool if that’s what he needs. I don’t think all the changes over the last couple of years has helped, his long time camera guy leaving then coming back but seems to be gone again. I really just think he is lost with what to produce. He had material possessions, houses, cars, studios, warehouses, lots of different friends etc as well as everything LA has to offer for as content but now it seems he has gotten rid of nearly all of that and is now left with his Yaks and a much more modest house that he doesn’t want to show too much of (which I totally respect) it does mean however that there’s not much for him to create content with. I’ll be sad if he actually goes. I’ve followed Jeffree since the MySpace days and used to talk to him on there back when he was organising the wardrobe/styling Kelly Osbourne. I dip in and out of TikTok but I really miss pre-pan long form YouTube content. Thank god Shane is providing us all with this series. Shane, don’t you dare quit. Eek super long comment which I know nobody will read but I feel better for giving my views haha.
Also same motto bitch im 32 i aint got time…..SO?
There is something about Shane at Denver Airport, the conspiracy airport, that feels right! Are there still all these weird murals there?
It’s shocking hearing Jeffery wants to retire from YouTube. But honestly what ever makes him happy is what I would like for him. I love this new life with his yaks
BRING BACK THE GHOST
Jeffree quitting youtube nooo please dont leave u and shane are my favourite  u both inspire me i feel sp happy watchinb u both on ur own and together love you both 😢❤
I only come to YouTube for Shane, Ryland, and Morgan. Nothing else on this app brings me joy anymore. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Wow. So much to take in. But i get where JS is coming from and look forward to seeing what he does next. Now i might have to go download TikTok so i can keep up with him. Great job Shane i always love experiencing your content. Im so glad to be part of your life sir. Many prayers and positive vibes to you and JS and of course the whole gang. 💖💖💖
I get J, but I realy hope you stay with us Shane, because you are truly one of the great ones ♡
I'm crying jefrees saying two more videos! IM Crying damit!
Wow 😮 did not see that coming with Jeffree 😢 I know he has no need to continue with Y tube as audience participation is way down for all creators due to all the things he said but I always enjoy his palette launches and content he used to do.  Hoping this isn’t going to be a sign that you’ll hang up your button also????  Ps that was such a tease 😂thought we were gonna get a tiny sneaky peak at the final palette of Dawson & Star!!!  Short content just isn’t the same for me and I’m sure many others still enjoy the long content and would happily watch vlogs on the Yaks just as we used to watch the crazy world of the LA rich 🤑 x
So we aren't going to talk about the pallet? Lol I love jeffrees new life though . I love seeing him happy but I will say I kinda only watch YouTube I don't really go to Netflix maybe it's because I'm always working but I listen to all of your videos his videos Roland's while im working.
I am so sad that Jeffree is quitting YouTube 😢 😭 💔 😪 😞
I enjoy the work you put into these! 👏👏👏
If Jeffree atcually quits youtube I will be so sad tbh, I'll honestly miss seeing him
I do not agree with Jeffree about youtube. While other platforms came and went Youtube is that platform that is and was always consistent. The trends change - Yes, but that does not change Youtube’s “trendiness”. I might be on the minority, but I don’t use Tiktok, don’t use Netflix and YouTube for me still is that bitch and I keep finding New stuff to watch. I can see how quitting YouTube makes sense for Jeffree, but the argument that nobody is watching is completely false - just because he is falling out of trend on YouTube, does not mean everybody are.
Comments into the void 🤍
I care and I watch when my favorites are on. I understand creators can out grow what they have already done.
I still barely use TikTok. I would much rather have a full video than a reel or clip. But I agree, Jeffree needs to do what makes HIM happy and fits his lifestyle. Shane and Jeffree together are so much fun. And you can really tell that they just vibe so well. Just be you, just keep on doing what is right for you and makes you happy... All of you.
Wyoming bout to be so much more populated bc I’m omw
Wtf omg
os jeffree the first person to actually admit with actual words that youtube is dead?
Jeffrey seems like he finally found his peace. It's good to see that he found happiness in himself and doing what makes him happy and not trying to please everyone around him.
Has anyone used Shane’s code yet???? I need real reviews ppl lol
Jefree could pay for my college tuition with one bag 😟
Wow I never thought that Jeffree would quit YouTube. But if you don’t enjoy it anymore you got to do what makes you happy. I fully support you Jeffree much love❤️ Shane you are awesome and don’t let anybody ever tell you otherwise much love❤️
Please do a weekly podcast together!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
Why jeffre why!!!!!
i will miss jeffree.. i hope he stays blessed! <3
Did you Just change the title of this video?
Sobbing atm I love u so much shane and I'm gonna miss jeffrees presences on yt
Please Jeffrey don’t leave
OMG MAKE MORE JEFFREE AND SHANE VIDS !!! You two are so damn humble together ❤️ I love both of you because you're so real !!
I literally watch youtube religiously.
Love you all ❤
I clicked so fast! You saved my life !
This video and this duo has brought me unexplainable joy today. wow, thank you...
We better get a palette after this series or I'm gonna scream
The love and genuine happiness between these two friends is EVERYTHING @Shane Dawson @Jeffree Star 🥰💙 I would lose my $hit for their new palette before even seeing it. #friendship goals
Omg, when Jeffree whips out the g*n and Shane holds it 😆😆😆 I'm an 40( something) year old. My 22 year old daughter got me hooked on Shane and Jeffree when she was like 12. I live for these videos. Wish him all the luck! P. S. I still use my Conspiracy pallet ❤️🤘
I thought this old mf died
Good video. I feel this one.
Honestly it’s so good to see both of you guys & how you’ve both grown over the last few years. I’ll be sad to see Jeffree go but if he’s happy I’m happy
Stop, the way my heart sank 😭 I’m still here, I still click on the videos y’all make 🥺 does that not matter? (Obvi rhetorical, just sad asf)
Shane I love the series…
I prefer to watch YouTube videos. I don't like Tiktoks.
I feel so sad that Jeffree thinks no one cares about YouTube anymore. I still watch all of his videos. I hope he finds happiness in his next adventures 💚
😥 this made me so sad to see Shane's facial expression when Jeffree made that comment at the end of the episode...Shane you matter and I am so grateful you are back making content...I can't wait to see your journey to fatherhood and marriage to Ryland keep going and please make that horror movie  or a horror series...there always going to be critics but just know you still have fans that love you regardless of all the drama from the past ❤️
To new adventures, darling. 🥂
As a Wyoming girl, I spent 90% of the video thinking; I know that airport, I know that Centex, when are they going to The Hat 6? (best gas station in Casper)
I dont think youtube sucks, jefferee and the entire beauty community just fell off, everything has an era and the beauty community's era ended no one cares about makeup like they used to anymore.
This was fucking great 👍
I mean he's right though. Look at the views on this video so far. 2019 it would have been at like 500,000 already.
well slap me cause I still watch Youtube.
he’s not wrong, this is the only channel I’ve watched in the last few years. YouTube is ded n gone, tik tok is better you’re missing out.
I agree with Jeffree about YouTube tho
Jeffrey, I’m for sure clicking on Shane’s videos ✋🏽💕
If I could watch anything every day for the rest of my life, it would be any Shane series! You are a god 🙌❤️
Why did the title change? 🤔
❤😂 hell yeah this is brilliant 🙌🏻🔥🔥
😢 I still watch YouTube. Admittedly not like I used to but I think that’s because I’m now 42yr with 5 kids and content isn’t what it used to be.  I was 26 when I created my YouTube account (Aug 2006). I still watch all my favourite OG YouTubers…well those that still create content.  It’s sad to see people put an end to uploading. I followed Jeffree on MySpace back in the day and now on TikTok. I’ll be sad to see him retire but he certainly deserves to.
This was garbage!!!!
remembering when i would cry ever night when they got cancelled and would fall asleep to the series
my husband and I have wanted to move to Wyoming for like 5 years now. One day!
Who cares...not watching anything about this egotistical snob.
I still watch YouTube videos I still love makeup videos
never stop making content<3
i feel like this has to be a joke but i'm afraid it's not. i mean it doesn't make any sense, like i said he still has over a milion views on everyone single video and besides that it's his own choise not to make many videos anymore.
I literally sat in silence for 5 minutes after it ended. A couple tears shed. Im sad its understandable why jeffree decided this. I still watch them though! Jenna now jeffree, hopefully shane doesnt for a long time. Thank you foi r some truly iconic videos. Love 😢
😭😭 the second pallet.. Ugh my heart. Break the internet part 2
jeffree looks so carefree and in the moment now! that tan suits him well ! ❤
This is so nostalgic to me, I never expected to be watching these series again. It’s like it never ended.
The hug said it all ❤️
I love this
Fantastic series Shane!! Wonderful seeing you & Jeffrey together again! Can't wait for part 3 ❤️😊
I love casual Jeffrey.😊
This made me feel so sad for some reason 😭
Why do I feel like the fact that Jeffrey star went from high end insane makeup to being a yak farmer and handgun owner is the BEST THING EVER.  Don't get cancelled for touching a gun Shane O.o
Um he just posted another new pallette *spoilers*
Can’t watch this yet but giving you the viewww babe 🎉
So proud of you Jeffrey you deserve the real happiness.. thank you Shane for sharing
Jeffree’s channel was my escape from life. To see him leave hurts. Ive been a fan since the start, i pray i still get to see videos and content from him
Please do some ghost stuff again, I loved it 😂
It’s insane to see Jeffree driving around places and roads I’ve driven my entire life… can’t believe how many people know about Casper now 😳
Jeffree in his yak era is so iconic
Ryland: Soo are we dressing to impress?? Shane: 🙄  My favorite YouTube couple. 💑
God I hate that he’s right but I’m still watching ❤
Seeing Shane & Jeffree completely grounded like this IS EVERYTHING!!!! What a full 360.......I'm so proud of both of them. TBH...Jeffree looks at peace with his life & surroundings MORE than I've EVER seen!! SOOOOO HAPPY FOR HIM☺️🙏❤️
Excuse me but I watched every Jeffries  youtube makeup reveal and I love them! And literally watch YouTube every day.
OMG DO ANOTHER SPOOKY BOYS SERIES WITH RYLAND AND JEFFREE!!!!!
I still watch YouTube 🤌
I got a little sad when Jeffree said he was leaving youtube. Jeffree please don't quit youtube. You have so many people including me that watch you on here. Love you both.
The ultimate duo is back!!!!
Ahhh the clip of Athens 😭 go Dawgs
Jeffrey pulling out the gun was so funny seeing Shane’s reaction lol
Jeffree is such an inspiration 💖
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I'll say it once and I'll say it again. How many people including myself always has the people they watch on YouTube or whatever it may be all the ups the downs the growth that turmoil . We all that you for sharing whatever you do share with us. We do not have the entitlement to you or your lives. If you feel like your life is going a different way. And you are on yo bigger and better or just want space and your life back. Not one of your followers will get mad or blame you if anything we are all happy for you!!! Yes we may be a little sad but in the long run... Cheering you all on!! Love you all!
Jeffree is definitely not leaving his Youtube bridge intact. No. He’s burning that bitch down. After watching this video I immediately went t to Jeffree’s channel and he’s right, his channel gets a fraction of the views it used to. If he wants to quit YouTube he should quit, but don’t blame YouTube. Plenty of channels have maintained their viewership through the pandemic.
Love seeing Shane notifications plus his documentaries are so good
NOOOO IM NOT READY FOR JEFFREE TO LEAVE US 😢
Ryland looks fire
OMG NOOOO IM GOING TO MISS JEFFERY!!!! Please don’t gooo
We’re here now watching YouTube now 🥹
Gut punch is an understatement.... don't leave us Jeffree!! 😢
I'm 31 year old straight male and will never not get excited when Shane post.
idec i will always love Jeffree and Shane. genuinely. i know i don’t know them personally but i feel like they are good people in their cores. have they made mistakes? sure but who hasn’t
Damn that breaks my heart i loved his long format videos. I was.still watching jeffree 😔
Jeffrey asking Chris if he's met his dogs yet, Chris goes "I don't think so"  That would literally be a core memory for me, 8 pomeranians, you'd remember ☠️🤣
Jeffree has his finger on the pulse of Pop culture.  I love his aesthetic and makeup 💄 I can’t wait to see what he does next  . 💋
Why the name change from retirement to new world?
This is amazing. So happy to see this series and I'm SO so happy  to see that Shane and Jeffree are friends (after all the shit they went thru, it could have ended up differently). Conspiracy was an interesting, beautiful idea/pallette and their hard work and dedication really paid off. I hope they do another collaboration and fuck everyone if they don't like it..💜
Is this a series or a hummer commercial?
I am no one xd Its ok i knew AHAHAHA
Can't wait to get home from working tonight and watch this!!!!!! So excited.
Man, I just love you see you and jeffree together. I have so much good will towards you guys even after everything. People learn and grow and make peace. Thats all you can ask for in this life.  I wish you bother ever happiness.  Shane i hope you make videos forever. I've watched you since I was a little kid lol. Please don't stop ❤
i started watching Shane when I was 13, i just turned 16 in july. crazy to think iv'e grown with him in a way and not only that but on his break i re-watched all of his older videos and they really helped during a dark time even if he will never know that... depression is a hole and over time watching him has helped the dark days a bit brighter. Thank you, Shane.   Love. Mo.
its the Ex-Yak-tly that got me to forgive. Look, they are really trying to show you guys that they are human, they aren’t perfect but they want to learn. Half the time it’s the environment you’re in that dictates your behavior. Remember that, it’s important kids. I’ve lived in nearly every corner of the world, find your environment
I still love watching youtube......
Oh, that makes me really sad. Personally, YouTube is my world. I go there when I want to connect with content creators, I get inspired, I feel at peace. YouTube is my number one go to entertainment. It saddens me to think that YouTube is dying.
The Air is not clean in Colorado
❤❤❤❤
Woooowwww definitely not what I expected. Jeffree quiting YouTube 😮
Maybe I’m unknowledgable about YouTube and platform/content trends but I think I disagree with Jeffree quitting YouTube  I still think Youtube is the BEST platform because it’s made by people for people not the media companies or traditional Hollywood and it’s WAYYY interesting  Maybe he should just shift his content to something else he’s passionate about unless making content is just not fun for him anymore 🤷🏼‍♀️
Omg this is amazing. Jeffery made a good point. I love this and it made me smile so much!
Is anyone else genuinely gutted about Jeffree quitting YouTube. I’ve been a fan since the MySpace days and I still loved and watched all his videos. Especially in the past couple of years with all the struggles I’ve had, it was like escapism. I’m glad he’s found happiness though.
Wait hold up, so when jeffree said he was done on YouTube after 2 videos and he showed you the wedding palette.. that really meant the reveal for that collection and the new Psychedelic Cricus collection reveal was the last two? 🥺
I’d be genuinely devastated if Jeffree ever left YouTube for good!   Honestly, all the people on social media that participate day in and day out calling Shane and Jeffree down are what is wrong with the YouTube world. All the people that Constantly say all Shane and Jeffree do is cash grabs are full of shhh! They enjoy cancel culture and are extremely hypocritical bc they constantly use their names in their content bc they know by doing so they’re doing their own version of cash grabs bc Shane and Jeffree still take in tons of views bc of their popularity! It’s just so friggen annoying that all these disgusting, judgmental, awful human beings are seen as “good people” but do nothing but call everyone down for the same stuff they do when their cameras ain’t on! I think they’re all the ones that need to get help!   Anyways, here I am bitchen and complaining about all these people and being negative myself but I got all worked up bc I know I ain’t speaking for just me when I say there are still millions of us that love to and want to support you both!!
I loved the old Jeffree but I love this new Jeffree more! Is there a part 2?
it seemed like jeffrey was getting annoyed by how they didn’t take him seriously when he was explaining why he was leaving youtube. he is so right about people not watching it like they used to. especially now with Tiktok and all those apps like netflix and disney+. he is completely right!
Actually a million dollar house IS humble. In NJ that’s like 3-4 bedrooms. Old and haunted too.
This is gonna be the longest week waiting on part 3
i still love youtube, i don't care about instageram or tiktok at all. especially tiktok is such an annoying and bad app.
Jeffree is a True American Yeehaw brother
Missed you guys ❤️❤️❤️
I absolutely love jeffree and respect any decision he makes. I’ve followed him since before he was a huge celebrity. This saddens me because I look forward to anything he posts 😭
Lowkey sad that Jeffree is leaving YouTube. An end of an era, but happy to see him happy. Also ya’ll better be releasing this palette now that I’m gonna be waiting 3 weeks to see it! 😅
What the...WHAT???!!!
I’m shookith
I’m sad that Jeffree is quitting YouTube but he genuinely seems and looks so much happier! I’m so proud of him for choosing to do what makes him happy. Also Shane ILY! Your videos are what makes me happy! You’re an amazing. Person. Btw I love that Chris is the camera person because he is BOMB ❤️
This was amazing Shane. Great job. I'm happy and sad all at the same time.
Just for the record, I watch a YouTube almost every time I sit down to eat, so I hope everyone doesn’t quit lol
While I too think youtube is some what dead and its i.possible for anyone to get the number they once did. I feel like we would all like to see Jeffree still. He needs a TV show
Makes me wanna move to the countryside even more. I vote we call Jeffrees Pomeranians his  ranches “guard puffs”!
You can literally see a LIGHT in Jeffree's eyes that was never there before. You can tell he really IS happy now. It's great to see.
flying economy #humble
Jeffree says nobody clicks the videos anymore and yet here we areee😂 i dont think youtube will ever be out of the picture though
So happy to see you guys together again. I have felt from the first series you two were friend soulmates. And for the love of makeup release that 2nd pallet. I'll buy one for everyone I know!
You should retire too my boy
ouuu paranormal content in Wyoming?!
It’s sad that YouTube isn’t what it used to be in late middle school and early high school. I remember coming home every day and watching Shane’s videos. It was my escape from the sever bullying both at school and at home. It’s sad seeing all of my favs leaving.
The editing on this part is so dope. I love you guys and this series 😊 Congratulations 🎉
LITERALLY WATCHING THIS ON YOUTUBE
Omg that ending. I mean he ain't wrong. YouTube has gone way way down hill.
waaait wait wait.... i usually agree with jeffree on literally everything but i have to say i think he is wrong about youtube... his videos recently have been just make up launches he hasnt done FUNNY reviews or cracked jokes or anything crazy in a long long time... so ofcourse u arent gonna get the views on a make up pallet launch video that u would for like going to the dollar store or the old ass make up tutorial video he tried to follow that one was HILARIOUS to me ive watched it multiple times... and  A LOT OF US have REWATCHED the series bc WE MISS JEFFREE AND SHANE CONTENT whether they are together in the same videos or not i miss videos from jeffree that arent fuckin make up launches i wish he would reconsider 😢
Love that this series is a thing ❤❤❤ however the high from getting a new video from you crashed so fast when Jeffrey dropped the bomb about quitting YouTube 😭😭😭😭 I was literally screaming at my phone “ I click! I watch! I am still excited when a new video drops!!” But I get it, you have to do what makes you happy ❤
Hey I still come home from a long day and I go on YouTube to watch. Creators aren’t trying as hard because of TikTok but if they made lil more effort, YouTube would never die out.
To both you and Jeffree (and your loved ones respectively), wish you guys the best.  Definitely a pleasure to see more videos <3 :}
I’m crying
Awww I’m sad 🥺
Seeing you both together again makes me so happy, your chemistry together is everything! Glad your back. ❤
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SHIT OUT OF THAT UNRELEASED PALLETE
Also must mention I love this jeffree! He looks so happy and I'm happy for him ❤️❤️
"No ones watching youtube no one cares about it anymore." Me, who still watches YouTube religiously 👁👄👁
every single video of his still has over a milion view and he says no one cares ??? wow, incredibly ungrateful !!!!!!!
I miss this duo so freaking much, the jokes the no filter conversations, I’m sort of sad that it took +2 yrs to see them again together but I understand why ❤
I'm so grateful that Shane still making video and having fun with it. I really do appreciate the amount of time and effort he puts in his work. Every soundtrack is so on point it makes me feel like I'm watching a high quality documentary. I have goosebumps every time music starts playing ❤️  also I really like how Jeffree starts showing his masculine side more (not with guns though, it's kinda scary😅). I mean we always knew he has balls of steel, but now, especially with yak meet company it's shine even brighter 😂 I like to see him more serious and calmer then before.  And of course I can't wait for next episode. this one went too quickly. but I love it ❤️love you Shane and Jeffree. and Chris. and Ryland. and Maddie to ❤️❤️❤️
You guys are the only thing I watch on YouTube now. I rewatch old videos of you both& get nostalgic thinking about how many web browsers I had open cause I wanted the Conspiracy collection sooooo bad before it sold out. I love you guys!
Jeffree is giving me John Mayer
All I can say is WOW
YouTube may not be the same as it was but Shane we love your videos! Never stop posting❤️
Not him wearing a double mask 😂
13:42
perfect timing with the video and amazing content as always, thank you shane!
This brought so much memories of a-whole era of my life, i used to enjoy u guys so much. I still do. Seeing you back is really overwhelming in a very good way❤
Funniest line ever as long as you don’t use they, then you will be fine
I kinda had a feeling he was quitting YouTube but actually hearing him say it hurt a little but it it brings you peace then do it. ❤❤❤❤
Shane all I want to say is that I love your series that make and have already made and is on your channel and all that I am going to say is to keep it up and don't let haters bring  you down. You have tons of support even us your fans support you in whatever you want to do and we support you when a new episode of the podcast comes out every Monday. So I  hope you have a great day and night also we love you Shane.I will be waiting for the last episode of this series and the next episode the podcast.
Jeffree living carefree and happy in the middle of nowhere is such a vibe. I love how relaxed and content everyone is now.
I still love YouTube.
I am so happy to see Jeffree  NOT give an F what others think.  The changes he has made are Healthy and smart.
I get why heff said that cause I stopped watching too but honey I stopped watching him not my favs
Just rewatched part 1 so I could flow straight into part 2. The amount of happiness and contentment Shane’s videos bring me is insane. I swear the only time I’m ever on YouTube now is for Shane and co’s content 💜
Okay but sus went off
I love watching them on YouTube...makes me sad that Jeffree doesn't see how important his videos on YouTube are
Not jefree saying "time to jenna marbles and do something else" 🥲
i’m so proud of you shane, and to be starting a new series again is amazing, love you and jeffree
jeffree is giving me yassified tiger king vibes at the beginning
The BEST SERIES on YOUTUBE. Is always going to be Shane and Jeffree ❤❤
I truly wish Jeffree wouldn't quit, I still watch everything, I'm still working on a way to get all of the pallets that he made, literally one of my favorite people on the whole of the internet.
Omg I loved this omg I missed you guys together I can't believe Jeffery is leaving YouTube 😭💔 I don't want this to end! please make something together to celebrate your friendship and journey please 🥺
I'm still going to watch YouTube for Shane and a handful more.. that's it.
And I love watching YT. If only Leafy could return, the Trinity would be complete.
I literally balled hearing jeffree saying he’s quitting 😢 he’s one of the massive reasons I love makeup and wish him all the happiness and love but it feels like someone just broke up with me 😂❤
Love you all
Not even done the video yet but those old clips of you and jeffree had me bawling 😭❤️ I just watched all of the other series over again today!
i’m so excited for shane to be starting a series again :)) means the world to me knowing how well shane’s doing and how happy he is❤️ LOVE YOU SHANE
This was so heartwarming to see you guys together again
YouTube won’t be the same without Jeffree 😢
« this feels so right, because it’s with you” it gave me chills. Your friendship is real and can face every drama ❤
Wyoming is Jeffrey’s state now.
Awe it's sad to see jeffree star quitting YouTube but as long as he is happy with his life now, that's all that matters! Can't wait for part 2!!
If you ever decide to release that palette, you have to call it Cancelled!
I still love Youtube, it's my escape from real life.  Seeing you and Jeffree together is so nostalgic, I forgot how hilarious he is.  We need that cancelled palette in our lives!  Love you Shane!  <3
Holy shit. That was a jaw dropper. Shane, ur killllin it❤ ryland servin LOOKS at the Denver airport✨ and Jeffree…..you will be missed. Legends. 🎉
Umm hi from a YouTube viewer 😅👋 i understand jeffree but I also feel like some of us come here for certain content. I watch your channel and lots of true crime or ghost videos. Tik toks even lead me here for the longer version. It's not dead..... Just less traffic.
I have no words just…wow😮
it’s important we all learn, grow, and forgive. so happy you two made amends. ❤
If Jeffree wants to quit YouTube more power to him but I mean he still gets around a million views per video. That's not nothing, that's not no one clicking. That's a lot of people who still want to watch his videos. I get he's not getting 10-20 million views anymore and if he's not happy with it then he should do what makes him happy. However I think it's kinda dismissive to the million people who do still tune in for him for him to say that.
I lived in Casper! Some of my best friends and happiest memories are from there!
Wow. I’m so proud of Jeffree
"I like travelling, just not with... yanno... Elton John" 🤣 Obsessed with your relationship
I wasn’t expecting him to say he was quitting YouTube actually I thought he was gonna say he was done making makeup 🙈 it doesn’t seem as bad to leave YouTube because the state of YouTube these days has changed so much. We can still see him on IG and snap and tiktok.
Shaneeee that cowboy vest and shirt suits you so well!! I'm glad you're trying new things idk what to say other than it suits you like omg 🤍
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm no one... i love watching your videos. Rylands and Morgans. I look forward to them every week. Y'all are my people! I absolutely love Jeffree, and I do miss him on YouTube but i understand life is taking him a different way and I am here for it. Even though I only get a window into Yalls beautiful lives.
I still watch YouTube lol I think people just don’t care about beauty videos?
This video is iconic as always 🥰🫶🏼
Jeffree looks far happier & I can only think that helps him focus better for all of the businesses that he runs. Looking forward to the next video!!!
30k his last video, and no one watching,you tube sucks.ok bipolar
Wow you can really tell and see the difference in Jeffree. You can tell that he is truly happy and is thoroughly enjoying his new life. Its genuine, its real. Just by the way he talks, what he laughs at, major difference!
I’m all about grass fed meat, how do we get yak?
.... hmmm. I'm trying to get into it. You hyped like a turn of events or something serious would happen at the end. Now those posts you made saying that are gone. Imma watch the next one. I'm trying shane.
Been there 4 years ago and I'm still here 4 years later
I still watch jeffree star videos 🥺
Shane I casually wear my Gucci shoes in the gym
The end of this one is very true, not a single person has been making the same views are 3+ years ago…
OMG the eeenddiiingggg! I love this so much. I'm crying! -spolier- I'll miss Jeffrey if he really quits YT. And I don't want to sound naive but if Shane and Ryland do the same, THEN for sure there'll be nothing for me to come here for. I LOVE  Shane's developing of an idea and the storytelling and set up leading to a 'reveal'. I already love this series! Can't wait for the last ep!
Jeffree Star retiring from YouTube. In the meantime, I bought a palette right after watching this video.
so first he literally denies his youtube channel now only being for reveal videos, then it's still very obvious that it is and now just this...
Jeffree tennis rack smacking a bug is so me!
So happy to see Jeffree and Shane back together 🥺 this is such a treasured friendship
“YouTube sucks” ….🤣🤣
No one cares? omg I care about youtube! this is sooooooooo shocking :( the end of an era
So really, no pallet
You guys really need to bring out shane x jeffree 2
Shane and Jeffree is just magic
Honestly though, I love Jeffree for this. I'm only on YouTube for Shane and Hailie Jade's podcast.
🎉🎉🎉 Jeffree for always having wicked foresight, or a really good team. People will move from YouTube, and hopefully get a real life! Lol  also welcome to the country life Jeffree!! Let me know if you want some homestead secrets ;) love watching the two of you as always. Great job to Shane and company! ❤❤❤
I love this video so much I love seeing you and Jeffree together makes my heart happy
So proud of you! You’re an inspiration! So glad you’re back. I hope you continue like this!  Biiiig hug from Portugal ❤
Oh my goodness I just finished watching it and I’m sitting here crying. The two of you inspired me to Learn how to do make up and to love it and to think I’ll never see another make up tutorial or another review it just breaks my heart❤ I know you have to move on to bigger and better things but I’m really hoping if Jeffree 😢  is really done with You Tube Shane you help him go out with a bang and blast out that second pallet and show everybody what they’re truly missing I love you both you guys are amazing and Ryland and Chris and Maddie to see you all together again was just amazing so thank you ❤❤❤
Tiktok sucks . I'll never get it and I'll always watch vlogs
I am a HUGE Jeffrey star fan, even after everything. I love you Jeffrey!
He better not leave us I’ll be so mad Jeffree I want you to know as a fan I’ve watched you since the start I see you I watch you I love you don’t leave us ❤❤ This series and the way Jeffree has been has just opened my eyes and I’m screaming see he’s just fucken like us y’all he’s changed so much I love it seriously he’s a fucken king don’t leave us we see you !!!
Welp
Loving this series so far and I’m so glad it’s doing so well. From watching your videos in my teens to now being nearly 30 I’m like a proud mum that showed off my conspiracy palate even through the cancellation 😂 can’t wait for part 3 🙌♥️
As soon as jeffree said he’s quitting YouTube, instant tears 😢
Say what you want about Jeffree, but you can’t deny that he’s a fascinating person and a great businessman
Gawd you guys are such a breath of fresh air! I miss this kind of joking around! So many people get offended over every damn thing now….let’s just have fun! I’m so happy to watch your work Shane and to add Jeffree to it is perfection 🤘🏻💜
Honestly that whole thing was iconic old YT vibes, but jefferres right, tiktok has taken over YT by miles
"It's literally only a couple million...it's very, very reasonable"
Youtube and Netflix are my go to platforms
I want your makeup. FUCK THE HATERS! You all suck!
No dont leave YouTube am i the only person that doesn’t have TiKToK ? I love YouTube
12:47 why does Jeffery sound likes he's trapping Shane in a kidnapping 💀
"only a couple million" I hope y'all lose everything and I mean that.
Ugh I’m just so happy seeing you guys together again 🥰🥰🥰🥰😊 plz never stop filming together!!!
Omg...I looove jeffree's real honest sense of humor!!! I could NOT stop laughing when he said he didn't run over the man because they're filming!!! That was just GOLD...I don't know why, but it just was!!! 💜🖤🩷❤💛🩵💙💚
Jefeee literally has 15.9 million subscribers. There's plenty who watch. He's just done, hopefully we'll see him once a month or something
oh my god....
I think I understand why is jeffree saying that but when it comes to this type of series or series reactions people are coming for that more, DIY remodeling but beauty not anymore
I love the energy of Jeffrey in this video
jeffree leaving youtube soon is such a bummer but i get why he his 🥺🫶🏻
Shane, you real are great and skilled at what you create, NO ONE CAN TAKE THAT AWAY, BUT YOU. Thank you for getting back out there friend. I have all the conspiracy products and cherish them like preserved artwork.
As someone who started watching you tube In 2007 (when I was 13)  I grew up with YouTube and all the OG creators retiring is totally understandable but also heartbreaking
Over 19 million views already omfgggg
SHANE! I miss seeing you post regularly! I still go back to the conspiracy videos and watch them all over and over because I miss them 😭
Now you have to do a haunted series with Jefree it would be so much fun for you and fun for all of us to watch.
I'm so excited for this series! Hey Shane!
I still watch YouTube bro.   It's not a surprise that I'm Noone to Jeffree Star lol
I love how they flew from Denver to Casper and it’s only a 4 hour drive 😂😂💀
I still get excited to see new YT videos…. 🥲 That’s how I felt today when I saw the notification for THIS video. Maybe I’m just old
So glad Miss Piggy didn't succeed in breaking y'all up 💜
No @Jeffree Star I love you, but do what makes you happy! It's all about what's good for the soul! Do what makes you happy Jeffree,  but know I will miss you on here tons! I must be old cause I'm literally all about YouTube and hating tiktok. Oh, me Jeffree am I going to havta finally break down and get tiktok? 🤣😅
I love the new Jeffree!! He seem so much healthier and happier!!
Been waiting for this since last week. It's the medicine to the flu I'm currently sick with. Thank you! ❤ I absolutely love Jeffree too. I love watching you both together. It brings me joy. ❤
I cant wait a week for more😭😭😭 i need to see it all!!!!
I still watch YouTube…. 😂 I know loads of people that watch YouTube over Telly!  But I agree Jeffrey doesn’t get the views he once did after everything happened. It’s probably time
I love you and Jeffree so much. If Jeffree feels that YouTube isn't making him happy anymore, then I will continue to be a fan whereever and whatever he chooses to do. Shane, I've been a supporter since i was 15, I'm not going anywhere.
Shane is what I need in my life. I love this series and you please keep them coming ❤️❤️❤️ I feel a sense of peace when you upload the only reason I come back to YouTube so thank you.
SHANE JEFFREEEE U GUYS NEED TO RELEASE CONSPIRACY 2!!!!!!😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bullshit I love youtube
I'd like to say we only use YouTube, and me and my daughter will always love you all <3
I’m gonna go ahead and strongly disagree with Jeffree- I still watch YouTube! Lol 😅 But much respect to him, so glad he’s in a great place and is happy, and I hope the same for you Shane! ❤❤
💟
It’s always sad when we arrive at an ending.  Jeffree truly has done it all on YouTube. I hope he finds joy and peace in his next adventure! ❤️
Naawh thats so sad Jeffree is done with youtube😩
I forgot how well put together and engaging Shane's videos are! I think Jeffree is definitely wrong about youtube. Although it's harder these days, there are still a lot of people like me who prefer long form content and a lot of youtubers actually got massive over the pandemic eg. the Sidemen.
Don’t mind me suddenly feeling extremely guilty for not watching beauty YouTube anymore…. 😢😢
God I’ve missed you all being together!!
I do somewhat agree with Jeffree when he says no one is really interested in YouTube anymore, so many people are just turning to tiktok, people post vlogs on there, tutorials an so much of their lives.   I mean not me though obviously, I’m here watching this video, but his not wrong.
Uff… I really hope, YouTube is not dead… I still come home and watch it. 👵🏻 But I definitely now why I don’t have Tik Tok(ic) 🙈
“no one watches youtube anymore” i watch youtube everyday i look forward to people posting videos! i barely watch tv i watch youtube the most so that’s not true that no one cares about youtube! love you and your videos thank you for making them!
I think Jeffree should give YouTube another chance and should try to get reinspired, cause me and a lot of other people still love to watch YouTube for entertainment
Shane’s soul left his body on the zero to 360 minute hahahha
thats it ? i s2g if we have to wait another week for the 3rd
After watching choose or die ,I had a nightmare of choosing to kill my mom or watch my dog die
criiiiinge ew
@Jefferystar you look hot as FUCK. With that short hair.
So proud of you Shane and love the series. It made me sad that Jeffree is leaving Youtube but we can see him on another SM soo...
I missed you Shane
Wow so crazy! Can't wait to see the next part!
So sad that Jeffree is stopping. But I really wish him the best! Watching him grow as a person is so inspiring. I do hope he keeps making make-up, because he makes the best!! Sending you guys lots of love from Holland💕💕
Love this series already! 😭😭
This series is EVERYTHING and man I have missed it. Seeing how far both of you guys have come, even through the whole “cancel culture” crap is so freaking wonderful to see🙌🏻 May or may not have cried at the ending😭
“Ohh I like traveling, just not with Elton john” … I DIED 😂😂😂😂
these dont hit the same anymore:(  idk why
well its been a roller coaster ❤
Holy fucking yakk, you can't leave me hanging like that! Damn! Thanks for the content, loved this 💖
I can see how much Jeffrey has changed and I'm so happy to see him in such a healthy and happy state of mind. I'm loving this series so much 💜
I only watch YouTube!
Oh damn Jeffree 😭 I hope YouTube is not really dead because I still love it so much!
I will truly miss Jeffrey videos i watch everytime he posts. But if it makes you happy man live your life and be happy. But I'm so happy to see yall together now.
WE WANT THE CANCELLED PALLET!!!❤
We all love you so much Shane...so happy watching your videos, please keep putting them out, I know it is hard work because you put your heart and sole into every one...but you make so many peoples day...f the haters ❤️
I love you Shane and Jeffree 🥺❤️ i miss the series
Im definitely not surprised
I hate the idea of one of my faves not being here anymore cos I am on this damn app waaaaay too much but like…no Shane talk him out of this 😂😂😂
Living in the middle of nowhere is good for the soul - i did the same thing. Good for you jeffree
this gives me so much nostalgia, love it 🥹
no one watches youtube bc the iconss topped posting man
WE NEED THE PALLETE
Omg the end 😢so sad
It's so weird to hear hes retiring but I just want what's best for everyone's happiness
THIS WAS SO GOOD!! this was better than Part 1!!
I’m so happy to see Shane thriving and just genuinely happy.    But uhm ima need that pallet 🤣💗
Shane, you have got me through the last few years. I watched this episode with a huge smile on my face because you are back! Missed you ❤️
No just no the retirement 😭😭😭 my heart is hurting literally
It’s kinda sad that jeffree says YouTube sucks. I think Shane and ryland still really enjoy to create and edit and honestly jeffree saying that is kinda tough for both of them. I still consume everything they post so I hope this doesn’t make them change their minds about what they’re putting out. I love em all anyway
You guys wouldn't need the captions if the music was so loud Holy Molly
I've been waiting to see Jeffree and Shane reuniting!! 💗what a treat to come home too! Obsessed with your series. Thank you Shane 💗
I honestly truly don’t want Jeffree Star to quit YouTube cause since the beginning of 2013 or 2014 been watching his videos and like I’m already tearing up that he going be down with YouTube😢😢😢😢😢
I may not be the demographic of target, but I’m still clicking YouTube to watch videos.  Can’t wait until part 3!  TYSM for creating still.
Love you Shane ❤ please don’t retire anytime soon don’t listen to Jeffery we are still watching
My heart drops to my stomach when I see the ‘to be continued’ 😭
This is like a reunion with old friends. The vibes are on, Shane!
This is so good
Jeffree I cry for you! I love watching your videos even if it’s the 20th time watching you. You’re so down to earth and such a real person. Love you always!❤️ Very proud of you! Reach for the stars! 🌟❤️💕 you too Shane! 💕
I still watch his videos tho 😔🥹
Aaahh I missed jeffree !
YouTube >>>>>> TikTok
I'm still very much Interested in YouTube lol
:/ we gonna miss u jeffree
You have me in a choke hold! Please don’t stop making docuseries  I live for these!!!
I need a Jeffrey/Shane ghost hunt 😮
I absolutely loved the youtube videos jeffree made, he’ll be missed on this platform forever
so happy they are together again💙
I love to see you all living your best lives! 🤩 Wish I could live mine too one day...
Jeffree was iconic with the bling and birkins and everything in between but if I’m honest hes a great person it’s nice to see him happy and content and with everything stripped back x genuine and kind hearted and I love this side of him please don’t completely disappear though we need you xxx
I’m so sad. I still want to watch jeffree for fun. Tik tok is not enough.
So wish there was a part 2 of a Shane palette. Love my conspiracy palettes.
Jenna 😢💜
😭😭😭😭 jeffree is my reason for you tube 😭😭😭😭
Every time I watch one of your videos it feels like an hour passes in 15 minutes. Like??? ;-; I know the videos are long, but they're so well paced and entertaining.
Jeffree ist so humbled and chill, really the way he talks and everything. Wyoming did him good.
Finally, watching ❤️❤️❤️
Shane- “This feels like rehab…I’ve never been but🤷🏼‍♀️”
Jeffree playing hay day IRL 💀
He says nobody is watching as he still gets millions of views. But he is "grounded now" okay sure...
The Jenna Marbles shout out at the end….. happy and sad tears!!! ❤
Not going to lie, I've watched the entire series all over again a couple times. I miss how happy I thought I was. This pallet came right before my entire world exploded. Guess we have something in common, huh? I've missing seeing you both happy. I'm hoping this coming year is a new start for people. Let stop all the BS & just get back to loving everyone while living a fantastic life.  When the pandemic happened we all stopped wearing makeup because we never left the house lol I'm thankful to get to share your lives with you. Welcome back boys
Shane I always watch yours too. I love y'all!
Then Jeffree pulls out his Uzi. oh shit.... lol!!!!!
Jeffree...🥺🐏❤️
Chris asking to pet the yaks is so me 😭❤
is the 2nd pallet really coming out? i hope so it would be good for use both to do 1 last pallet before jeffree unfortunately leaves you tube☹️
I go to YouTube for so much. It's here to stay. It may not work for Jeffrey's needs, but it still works for Shane's until it doesn't.
YouTube will be great for as long as Shane keeps posting...and Ryland vlogs of course 🥰
God bless you folks and Jeffree! :)
I get so excited everytime a video drops still to this day.
We do care ♥️
I love Shane and Jeffree together
Jeffree Stars retirement from YouTube is wild! I click on your videos and watch! 🥺 You will be missed!
Hey Shane, since you and Jeffery opened the portal to hell that turned the world topsy turvy with the last series, maybe with this series everything will go back to normal😅😅😅Love the series so far❤❤❤
omg.... if Shane literally starts thinking about quitting too...... my heart will ACTUALLY be more broken then ever.... I just wold not be able til handle it.....
It’s really good to have you back Shane!
Lots of people love youtube they just don't love the same stuff over an over unfortunately people like Jeffery time has come to an end. Just like tiktok isn't for the celebs its for the normal people it is so much more then just dancing and lip syncing.
It's so refreshing to see the weight lifted off Jeffree. ❤
love this ! 😂
Oh my godddd 😮
Please for don’t leave YouTube!! 😢
I’m not ready for the day jeffree and Shane both stop posting on YouTube 😢
Jeffree quitting YouTube is not a huge surprise. Good for him. He's not wrong There are very few that I watch.
Wait can y’all still do a Shane 2?😮
Hunting in Wyoming. Another series?! Yes pleaseee!!!!!!
Jeffree and Shane together are literally everything.
Youtube no apesta Jeffree, simplemente tus escandalos hicieron que tus fans dejarán de interesarse en tu contenido y tu marca
“ Just know that this feels right when it’s with you” how cute was that
Nooo!!! Jeffree better not be quitting YouTube! I'm literally crying 😭 I love seeing his video!!
Is super sad to hear Jeffree say he gonna quit YouTube I love watching his videos and yours Shane ever sense I was little I saw almost all of both your guys videos from conspiracy theory to you taste testing food and him doing is it Jeffree Star approve from all the pallets reveals I love you guys so much and I hope you guys stay on YouTube and make content that you guys love to put out and only ture fans would stay and keep supporting you like I do
Jeffree is HILARIOUS. So happy he's so happy. but i still come to youtube for certain people, like shane!
I can’t wait for the next one 😢
Let’s not talk about YouTube dying, that’s so not true!  But I can only imagine what it’s like if a huge audience stops watching…. That would be de-motivating
I don't want Jeffree or Shane to leave YouTube
i'm actually constantly watching youtube videos please don't stop posting 😭
Jeffree, not that I’m anyone, but I still love your channel. I’ll watch you and Shane review Kylie Skin while I’m doing my skincare 😅 it’s comforting and fun. But it’s understandable hanging up the channel and moving on. 💗
I was so sad to hear that no one is watching YouTube anymore and a lot of creators won't be doing this soon. I still love watching YouTube videos
The ironic part of jeffree quiting youtube is that he will get so many more viewers now for saying that and for being apart of another shane doc. But even if you go to shanes videos years ago they all have 20-50 million views and his latest get a few million. I didnt think about it but he is right it seems like nobody cares about longer videos anymore due to tiktok. Its the only videos I prefer honestly but im old. xD
This friendship is elite!!! Pls never stop being friends you guys are meant to be ❤
This Jeffree and Shane separation made me feel like i was on the wrong side of the mexico WALL. I'm feeling SO ... like we can LIVE AGAIN AND BE WITH our JEFFREE AND SHANE family!!!
Am I the only one clicking on this whilst thinking 'launch the pallet launch the pallet launch the pallet launnchchcienebskdhjdndpalette'
Have watch the video yet but some f happy for it. 💜🖤
im still clicking on youtube ),:
I ALWAYS watch your videos Jeffree!!
SOOOOO PROUD OF U
Jeffrey saying how YouTube sucks and no one watches it. When Shane is literally there to film a YouTube video…while the whole audience is on YouTube watching that said video currently 😂
I love these videos. Everyone looks healthy and happy. Jeffree looks so amazing.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yay! 😻
I love you so much Shane, you got me through the hardest time in my life. You have no idea how many hearts you touch just by being you ❤
I feel like i'm watching the end of an era and i'm not ready
thumbs up for chris sporting that double face mask.
HELL YEAAAAAAH
waiting for a new episode of a shane series is so nostalgic to me 😭 i love u sm shane!!!
Yesss.. Eating a homemade hamburger while watching lol Thank you Shane gloss;)
just incase this means anything- you are not wasting your time making videos shane. i will never stop watching them!
YESSSS SHANEEEEEEE
I love Jeffrey sad that he’s leaving . But he deserves nothing but the best they both do Shane included
I love this! I appreciate you guys making this. ❤
I had A feeling Jeffree was going there,I feel like YouTube is dying out,but I will continue to watch Ryland and Shane 🥰
“No one watches YouTube for enjoyment anymore”- 👀 me clicking on Shane’s channels to watch his haunted videos at the same time every evening… 😂
No Shane I don't believe it.. Jeffree maybe is having a moment?? God I haven't watched my favorite make-up guru in 3  years I have been sick... I gotta see this.. AWWW the 4 year ago clip the hair!!! Luv Luv Luv remembering it!!! 💜🈂️🙏🏼🧿📿
I’m bawling my eyes out. This can’t be true. Jeffree and Shane are my escapes from this mess we call life. I’m crying hard rn. You guys saved me from my darkness so many times. Just...no 😢
Well I can see why no one watches YouTube anymore, look who owns it. It’s sad that they’re not allowing freedom of speech anymore and I’m really hoping that after today with the election that things will be changing. I’m happy to see Jeffrey following his heart that’s the best way to live. I really have to try yak! LOL I hope you talk about what it taste like. Looking forward to seeing more of this journey!
You guys in the airport with all the old people watching you was the highlight of my life
Uhhh I still watch YouTube, we all still watch
Woah! Jeffree!
The music is everything so love this new series great just guys!!
Loving the new jeffree
Sigh, now I have to wait another week🥴🥹🥹
I’m so happy you’re making series again I miss you Shane !💜
Are you kidding me?!?! That was like 5 minutes long! As for Jeffree… I looked to you for makeup and makeup reviews. I ALWAYS CLICK!
Good for Jeffree make such a hard choice like he did. I will miss watching his videos but, he is still so active every where else that we will still get to watch him. Just in a different way. Great video guys.
What an emotional roler coaster this video is! 🙈 I am not sure whether I am crying because of sadness, excitement or nostalgia 😅🙈
Once again depriving myself of sleep to watch a Shane episode.
FYI I skipped through most of this. The editing is so frustrating.
This is crazy to me because I literally watch YouTube more than anything else 🤣 I watch tiktoks on YouTube instead of the TikTok app. I don't really watch TV or Netflix or anything anymore when I'm bored I just scroll YouTube. But I have noticed there's a lot less...new content on this platform lately. Why I super appreciate Shane's videos, Ryland and Morgan's vlogs and the podcasts because otherwise I would get bored.
These days, I spend more time watching livestreams on YouTube.  It's not suited to every community, so it kind of depends what you like.
okay shaneeee ik Jefferys giving up youtube, but yk you cant righttt? like you’re the reason im here literally never quit😭
“Time to Jenna marbles and do something else” it’s really is the end of an era😢
If Jeffree leaves you tube I will definitely miss him very much!
I care. I click on the videos. Please don’t let him leave you tube. And don’t you dare ever leave Shane! You two are my happy place. Also we need a haunting Wyoming with jeffree series now.
I love seeing you both together again. I laughed so much during this video and can’t wait for the next one. ❤
Awe I still watch YouTube
I can’t wait for next week I loved this I loved all the emotion you guys are amazing fuck the haters I will always be a supporter ❤️
Never stop doing videos. You are the best❤️❤️
I need ten parts !!! These videos feel like family xo ❤
Love your videos!
Shane I’m loving this!! But Jeffree is right .. no one watches YouTube for make up anymore everyone goes to TikTok .. has he announced on his social media he is quitting ??
these tears I just can't control 😭❤️✨
I literally sobbed  at the end 😭😭😭😭 I love Jeffrey!!! I watch all his videos and rewatch since he stop posting often. 😭 But I'm glad he's doing what makes him happy💙
Shane and Jeffree doing a ghost series.  I need this now. Pretty please.
YouTube sucks but I hate tiktok
Idk if you’ll see this comment but my grandma has cancer and it’s really hard and your video is the first thing to make me smile today
Yay!
Jeffree says "2 more videos and I'm done" and I seriously got tears in my eyes!
I WATCH HIM like no he has to stay
NOOO IM SO SADDD JEFFREEE😢❤
I'm so happy for Jeffrey that he feels so comfortable and happy now, thats all you could really wish for 🥲
Just started, but if true, I've always wanted to meet Jeffree. He's 1 of my 2 people that i would love to have my dream dinner with. Now it feels like I'll never get that chance.😢 However, i love him enough to want the best for him and only he knows what's best for Jeffree. I will definitely miss.... THIS! But Jeffrees true real happiness, that's what matters!😘💖🌟💐😘💖🌟💐😘💖🌟💐😘💖🌟💐
Ok , 🖤bye Jeffree, we'll be here waiting 🦥if you need us.xx
Wait if J stop posting on YouTube I’m cry like wtf no
i love JS but don’t agree with his assessment. maybe as far as the beauty community, but there are worlds of other content that people have interest in.
Shane is one of my favorite YouTubers, and I love to see new videos from you Shane. Please never stop making videos and series
Love you, Jeffree!!!! ❤️
IMDYING AT THE ARCADE SCENE WITH THE PICTURES
Jeffree said jenna marbles and i started crying
Jeffree has a point… YouTube sucks anymore…
I watch YouTube 😭
Shaneeee you did it again 😍
I rewatch your videos and Jeffrees every single day on repeat!!! My boyfriend plays his games and I play you guys, he now loves you both too!! Jeffree says he gets no views, girl I’m there everyday, stay on YouTube !
But yet this is on YouTube so it can’t suck that bad! Love you Shane 💕💜
Ahhh I have been waiting for this reunion!!
Shane will never understand my love for him he truly is like a best friend, dad everything ❤
You are literally my Favorite ppl ever 😭💞
birds of a feather lmfao
that buffy ad was a goddamn jumpscare
Can't wait for the next xoxo
I think hearing "YouTube is dead, no one watches it anymore" really hit me because I'm still on this app daily watching all my favs. As a fan, I already lost Jenna. I'm scared the rest are going to slowly disappear too and that's just depressing. I walked away from this video really sad, I'll admit.  Edit: Shocked at how much this comment took off. I see several comments saying "there are plenty of people to watch" who then name a bunch of young 20 yr olds. No offense to new creators but a lot of them are young and I am much older than them. Seeing my favorites (like Jenna) slowly disappearing is depressing. I have nothing in common with people so much younger than me. So no..there arent plenty of people to watch. Luckily I found the gaming community as of late and that's something that never dies it seems and is ageless.  Also, I agree with the people that are saying that Jeffree just means the beauty community on YouTube is dead. That's 100% correct and honestly, they deserve it with how catty and drama filled they always are. But I digress.
It's sad to hear that Jeffree is quitting YouTube, I really enjoy watching him.
Shane! Only 5 minutes of this episode was new info rest was flashbacks of the last series. Where is the juice??
Chris when he said can I pat a yak 🥹 my gosh that was so adorable!!!
The reunion is everything! I’m not even into makeup but the palette is gonna be everything. I bought the Conspiracy palette to flex on my sister😂
Lol that is totally me on an airplane as well! I have flown so many times but always get nervous for take off and landing.
His videos bring me so much happiness ❤️
I love the energy. I watch YouTube all the time. Can't wait for the next episode. 🤓
I love these so much. I love the series with these two. You guys are the best
This was entertaining thank you!! HEY! I still watch youtube....... Oh god I am old
😳🧍🏽
Can I just say jefrees vibes are so much lighter!! I'm so happy for him♡
if shane shot Jeffery this would be THE BIGGEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD!!!!
This is literally the saddest shit I still love jeffree and YouTube got me through the past few years I miss his videos I don't do tictok and I won't lol wtf jeffree 😢😢 why you do this to us 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
YASSSSSSSS QUENNN SLAYY
This actually made me sad I feel like a saga of jeffree is done after 20 maybe even more years I’m sad
Who else just clutched their invisible pearls? OMG NO JEFFREE ON YOUTUBE!! THEN WHAT? I'M GAGGED
Omg I love this I can’t wait for part 3!
I’ve literally missed you guys together 🥹🙌🏻💓
Loved part 2! Love seeing you and Jeffree together! Can't wait for part 3 and all the yaks!!
I still watch You Tube daily
Literally so amazing to see all of y’all so happy and especially Jeffree out there thriving! Love you guys!  ❤
jeffree is just such a fun person to watch, selfishly sad we won’t see much of him, but so happy that he’s at peace❤
Jeffree quitting YouTube has me SHOOK. But I get it completely. I just hate that I’ll miss out on him and his Yaks.
This channel is irrelevant without Jeffree.
Gut punch is an understatement.... don't leave us Jeffree!! 😢
This… is… everything ❤
Oh that last clip. I miss Jenna so much 😭😭😭 We needed her during the Pandemic.
This video was so nostalgic and brought me so much joy!!!!!
Yassss!!!! Shane, sending nothing but love.
I LOVE THIS DUO, No matter what’s happened or why they got cancelled. I will always love them and watch their content ❤️
Jeffree looked  as feminine as always  then all of a sudden he picked up that automatic with the big old silencer and he looked so Butch I got turned on a f.
Jeffree: "no one watches YouTube anymore"  me watching every video he and Shane pump out: 👁️👄👁️
I honestly don’t know how I feel about this … my heart sank a little at the end …
This is so chill 🥰
Facts Jeffery! Only come on for Shane and his family but we love you and so glad your happy and its amazing to see ☺️
I’m just here to get an answer of wtf is going on Shane’s Snapchat? Every time he pops up I’m equally confused
"Oh its so nice that you stopped" "We're filming or I wouldn't have"  I get it 🤣
Go to rumble
My two favorite creators and will be forever 🤍
Just finished it❤ 😮wow 😢
i have no words. i am speechless. but am so so so excited to see more of the iconic duo you a jeffree make up ❤️❤️
I honestly love how mellow and “grounded” and down to earth Jeffree has become!! I also love how you can feel the genuine friendship between them! ❤❤
i love u jeffree ❤️
Nooo Jeffree don’t quit I love your videos
Whaaaat!!!!! U tell us Jeffree is quiting youtube and then end it!!!??? Omg!!!! How long do we have to wait for part 3!!!!???? Aaaahhhh!!!!!
So happy to see Shane's posts again ❤️ missed you on YouTube so much
While it feels like the end of an era , I’m so happy I was here to be apart of it, Cheers to the future Shane and Jeffree ❤❤
31:36 was like something out of a transformer movie 🫣🫢
I still love YouTube but there is just not as much content to watch . But I would still watch all of you on YouTube .
me sat refreshing just to watch this every week like old times  i love it :)))
Anyone know the song at 52:00 mark?😫
JEFFREY PULLING OUT THE PIECE 😂😂😂😂
Epic!!!
The suspense!
Ohh Its here yessssssss🎉  wasnt expecting this title but LOVE them all everyone whos always been a part of his life ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m from Montana and this video made me sooo happy!! ❤ Love u Shane and Jeffree!
150 yaks ...finally LeVeLeD outttttt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is Jeffery... Hot af??
I watch YouTube!!! 😢
I live for Ryland not missing out on this Shane work trip. He has kids at home but a wife has to cash in on her perks dangit. It is the reward for getting the barn so spiffy and organizing the xmas lights and the millions of things he so proudly takes care of. YOU DESERVE IT ELTON!!!!
I knew it was coming that He’d quit YouTube. He’s right. The views just aren’t there/here anymore. But what’s next???? Besides TikTok. 😢
I love you guys back together! I could cry, alot of us still watch on YouTube ❤
Wow Jeffree is so different now. Im in shock.
This is amazing Shane, to see Jeffree in a new light is so nice too see.. he seems so much more calm and real. And to see your guys friendship is so genuine ❤
I’ve missed the Shane and Jeffree series. All of Shane’s videos used to and still are my life. I love you Shane❤!!!
💕💜❤️ Wish you all love and happiness and great Energy ❤💜💕
Hi shane! I know you probably won’t see this and this is cheesy af, but I just want to say that I love you ❤️ keep making awesome content.
I watch them.
Love him or hate him - nobody can deny that Jeffree is a natural born business person.
Here before 100k veiws wow
Watching this instead of listening to my anatomy teacher
Shane has been making my day for the past 8 or so years and god I even listen to his podcast everyday on my way to work just replaying them over and over because he makes everything better 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Seeing Jeffree play like a little kid in his hummer is everything lol
The fucking pistol 😭😂😂
Just a ton of useless, boring recycled footage from past videos, with you trying to act like something major is going on, but it’s just a video about Jeffree screwing u just like morphe did to him, but more boring even when that situation wasn’t on film. And this one is. And yet I’m more bored than I was reading about their sitch. Like I’m just so bored Shanus. Maybe do a video talking about your cancelation AND WHY U WERE CANCELED. INSTEAD OF PRETENDING LIKE IT DIDNT HAPPEN AND ITS JUST A FUNNT JOKE LOL like how are you this off the mark? You had a lot of fans once, and for you to not show them the respect and go into detail aboht what went down and how you’ve grown and learned from it, but instead shoving videos aboht makeup (which haven’t been relevant in 2 years) is somehow going to distract from the fact that u haven’t taken accountability for shit, is genuinely a bummer. And then to see that you’re videos haven’t grown or matured since u went into hiding, is equally more upsetting.
I'm so so so proud of you!!! You're doing what you love and it shows!!! I love you💜💜
Am I the only one who still has mixed feelings about shane and jeffrey? Can't help but watching it. But also why does shane always use songs with voices that sounds like him hahah lmao
Absolutely LOVE Jeffree’s “Go Home” comment lol! I caught it!! Nice one!!
I love you Shane❤
If they don’t release this pallet I QUIT
chris is literally meee "can i pet a yak? i'll cry" lmaooo
Omggg Shane, i can't believe you ended the episode there!!!! I NEED MORE!!! Like seriously, you & Ryland move to Wyoming with your alpacas while Jeffree has his yaks & you do an episode together every week. Plus you need to take Chris for his cute chuckles from behind the camera ❤❤❤
Me yeeey shanes made a new series with jeffree  my partner not another lot i have to watch.. while he actually really enjoys them quietly 🤫 😂 x I love your video shane x
God this series has been so incredible to watch, I missed you two laughing and the energy you two give off together. Forever gonna love and support you guys ❤️
So humble now wow
❤ ❤️‍🔥you guys are amazing keep doing you beauts ❤❤️‍🔥
Oh my god no he can’t leave YouTube
My sausage dog always goes mental when he hears Jeffree's Pomeranians 😂🤣
Missed you guys together so much 🥺😭💖💖💖
Shane l have followed you for years, keep up the good work. All the best from Serbia 👏💙
Lol jeffree putting shames finger prints on his gun w silencer …. Then jeffree talking about his accident that it almost killed him then he proceeds to use his nerd rocketmobioes jet boosters for fun. All before thry even got to his house from the airport 😂. Just an average hang w uncle Jeffree 😂💀 there’s no way for this to only be two parts. There’s so much going on here
❤❤ lots of love ❤❤
“There’s only 1500 in America and this f***** somehow got one, WERE GOING GREEN NOW”  Iconic honestly hahahaha
love Shane & Jeffree together! can’t wait for more parts ❤️
i would watch Jeffree for another 50 years, but his happiness and passions always have to come first, i'll support and cheer him on no matter what 🖤 also i don't believe youtube will ever die, even though we don't have the pandemic views, this space and the community it created between creators and core "fans" is here to stay, imo.
I love how Jeffree can be so relatable to people all over the country and Shane acts like he is on a strange planet in Wyoming.
Omfg I love when Jeffree just pulled out a gun 😂😂😂
Iconic Shane ❤❤❤❤ I’m so glad to still follow after all these years  … your amazing
17:35  At first I thought that was a wax figure of Jeffree that they dressed up as a pilot! 🤭🤫😝
Denver Airport is literally my fave
I'm from "The Toughest Town on the Tracks" just across the WY border and can safely say that the paranormal energy around here is insane. Please take Jeffree up on that idea! It would be INSANE.
omg shane. i have missed you so much! keep up the good work. cant wait for you to come back 🤍
Hey… I still like YouTube. ☹️ I just can’t get with TikTok.
aww
When people still say Jeffree is toxic and hasn’t grown. I’m in shock at his growth and him realizing he doesn’t need the materialistic things (but also still has things like a boujee front gate 😂), and that he just posts without reading comments. He seems in a way healthier lifestyle and headspace.
Anyone else not feelin this? I gave it a chance but... not for me. Best of luck with your future content creation.
Omg a paranormal series in Wyoming would be everything 🖤✨🖤✨please!!! Ahhh
THEYRE MY GYM SHOES 😂😂😂
I waited all day to watch this!!!!!!  Love ya Shane!!!!
THANK YOU SHANE JEFFREE FOR THIS VIDEO SERIES LOVE YOU GUYS
DADDDDYYYYYYYYYYY talkin to Jeffree okay
ON ELECTION DAY! lol love you Shane ❤️❤️
Shane is ruining my brand. - jefree star  🤣🤣🤣🤣 his supposed friend
When Jeffrey says “what’s the point ? Who is going to click?” I felt that. I have been feeling that way for a while now, I don’t watch YouTube the same way I used to. I don’t get as excited anymore when a video comes out. It’s all very redundant
I can’t wait to see what the future holds for Shane 🙂🙂❤️
The good energy I feel it watching this make me so happy 😊 💖💖💖
eating popcorn in my bed while watching shane and jeffree again..ahh the good ol days 💫😌 im so happy
oml
There's 100% a different vibe around Jeffery and honestly.. I prefer it. Seems more at peace to be honest. Nice to see.
“I like travelling just not with you know Elton John”😂
Awe I’m so glad they can look back at the first series and be like I wish somebody would of told me babe someday these will be the good old days type vibe to it
Love how Jeffrey casually has his P90 on the counter.🤣🤣🤣 Take me home!! This looks so fuckin nice here. I'm a mountain boy too.
love u Shane love u Jeffree ❤
Lol let’s promote guns! You must be joking Shanus.
If you don’t do a ghost hunt with Jeffree I will be so disappointed!!
I’m so proud of you Shane 😊
31:00 the best moment 🤣😅😀 love JS and SD together ❤️
These series with Jeffree make me so sentimental. I watched the last one in 2019 with my baby while I was pregnant and on mat leave.. now I'm watching this with baby number 2. I'm so excited you're back❤
❤🙌🏻 yes yes yes yes ❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THE MOST ICONIC DUO OF ALL TIME ❤❤
I never stopped using my palettes. I even doubled up just incase I couldn’t buy another ever again (so glad I did)  So many of us silently stayed with you always Shane ❤
OMG!! I LOVE when Shane and Jeffree film together! They're so hilarious!
Ryland saying he loves tiktok now just cause of Jeffrey being on it lmao he really needs to learn to not be a follower (dont give me hate I watch the sip and he has never even tried to understand tiktok if you've seen the episodes you know)
34:08 not jeffree talking about millions of dollars like its nothing 😂
Proud of you! Doing well and doing things! Seemingly so happy!
So this is the one he sold?
Jeffree looks SO HEALTHY
I love this for Jeffrey so much love to y'all im only like 30min into so ill have more to say but YAYYYY SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH
Eye spy the Denver Airport stallion. Creepy 👀
Most awaited part 2. ❤️❤️
This feels right because its with you. 😢😭
That car is FUCKING DOPE!!!!   I'm almost crying
Yup just like I thought those colors at 10:03 were used in the Blood Money palette. Last week when I seen some of the colors I thought they looked familiar.
OMG 😂😂 .... The pinky 🤣🤣🤣🤣
💖💖💖💖
When I get the Alert of New Video it's game on lol
You released this episode just on time I was about to get ready to eat and I see an new Shane video pressed on that right away ☺️
Omg jeffree and Shane ghost hunting would be awesome, please Shane do it
A hot pink dumpster that’s life full circle for Shane and Jeffree like it’s pink gay and full of crap I love you Shane  and Jeffree and have your sense of humor so I know you know that’s pretty funny lol
Wait... farmer Jeffree in the hat is serving TRADE
I feel like Shane is a dumb millionaire he just doesn’t know how to use his money
Hii
Yeah so Jeffrey has been on a coke for a while now judging on his behaviorisms. I actually felt bad when he was describing his reasons for selling his mansion.
Jeffree talking about his house made me kind of sad
Jeffree is amazing if he feels he can retire then bless him. 😊
I hope that you edited this and not Destery. I will support stuff that you edit, but if your podcast, as much as I love it is edited by that POS I can no longer support that.
I LOVE this version of Jeffreelynn. My god, this is so refreshing
Nooooo Jeffree is wrong. I watch YouTube. I love YouTube! I hate tiktok and reels and shorts. I miss YouTube videos so I’m saddened that he is quitting. So many beauty gurus have moved to lifestyle videos or tiktok. There’s a huge gap now. I feel like I struggle to find things to watch and I miss all my faves. That’s why I’m ELATED you are back Shane. THANK YOU FOR NOT GIVING UP ON US! We love you ❤xx
Wow the energy is so high when you and Jeffree doing something together 😊, there’s something in the air! Love the series it speaks to all my emotions!
❤️ 🇺🇸 🌈
Omfg Jeffree and Shane at a haunted location!!!!!!  👏 YES 👏 PLEASE!
I’ve never been so happy in my entire life I just want to be friends with all of them
So sweet to see Jeffree pick them up at the airport
I instantly had to google “Star Creek Road” to see what the farm looked like. I honestly think that part will lead a lot of people to Jeffree’s house lol.
This made me so emotional. You guys are my inspiration and you and Jeffree helped me so much with my mental health. You guys don't know how much impact you have done on my life. Thank you so much for this.
*RAM RANCH REALLY ROCKS!!!!!!*
Shane and Jeffree being the dearest friends is probably the most unusual match yet it couldn't be more perfect. I'm not surprised that an epic change is about to happen because it couldn't have been any more obvious. I think moving into that ridiculously unnecessary mansion showed him that having everything was simply not the answer. It was like he went full cycle to find out where he's really meant to be and what really brings him happiness.
okay not that it matters, but do we think selling the big house, selling the clothes, the bags, was he hungry for money, or do you really think he's just over it? Is jeffree start cosmetics in trouble?
At first I respected your talent as a film-maker, and that has never changed, thanks for not giving up on us Shane!
Good to see Jeffery matured as a person from the cancellation but he still had that amazing and funny personality. Love to see he’s living his best life
When Jeffree whipped out his gun….I’m dead lol lol
Love the casual suppressor!
I just love this sm 🫶🏼
Jeffrey looks so healthy and happy, it makes me happy for him 🥲🥰
10:13 'I like traveling not with Elton John' lmaaaao this part cracked me up 😭
I love everything about this
It just makes me cry whenever I see Shane and Jeffree together. I can feel the love and care and laughter and creativity flowing and I am all for that, so wholesome *touchwood* 😭❤️
Love love love 🥰🥰🥰
love you both so much. this is amazing. video of the year. still hunting for the conspiracy pallete😂
Just thank u. Dont imagine how much your videos can give us a little distraction in sad moments.
So happy to see my 2 Favorite creators back on my fyp. Thank you for this little bit of dopamine to push me through the last months of this year. Love both of you so much
Omg noooooooo!!! I go to YouTube every single day!!!!! No Jeffree no!!!
OH MY GOD 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
These are the videos I look forward to smoke along with 😊💚
This video was amazing you and jeffree star are so so adorable amazing and i love seeing you together in a video again ive missed it so much, love you shane so so much xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤❤
I can't stop smiling it's been sooo long 😍😍
The voiceovers are vibes
jefree and shane opened a portal when they dropped the first pallete. thats why nothing was right with the world until this video dropped. yall closed it thank you
I wished y'all would launch it!
💖💖💖 Ok I just have to say that I love watching Jeffree and Shane, both together and separately. I hope Jeffree decides to stay on yt..he is one of a kind no matter how you feel about him there is no doubt that he is a hard worker and so so talented. I think he has just been misunderstood. Not saying everything he has done I agree with but I see change and that's all we can expect out of anyone. Shane, keep the content coming for freaking ever lol 💖💖
600 fucking acres holy shit
Wow!!! My daughter in law was the girl you met at the airport that had your palette!!! She was also wearing your conspiracy merch tshirt! I wish I could post the photo you took with her and her family!!
This is how we roll.
Thankyou Shane! I'm inspired by watching you. You are so resilient  and brave. Keep being you that's enough and it's amazing!
Just what I needed to make my day happy, Shane you a real one 💯
Crying like a baby when Jeffrey walks into the airport and hugs Shane, why am I so emotional about these two.  I'm so sad, I don't do TikTok and no more Jeffrey on Youtube is breaking my heart.
I was shocked to see this in my notifications.
Plssss do a ghost video with Jeffree in Wyoming
Omg iconic ghost hunting with Shane and Jeffree! Umm...yes please!!!!
Jeffree with his 8 dogs and 150 yaks leveled it out lol
It’s so nostalgic watching these vids 🥲
Can’t wait to watch this tonight 😮‍💨🔥
Love, love, love the music!!! It fits so perfectly with each scene and brings the best vibes :)))
I’m not shocked he quit  YouTube.  I’m happy for him it’s good for mental health
37 minutes I and don't want it to end. Lov u Shane and Jeffree💜
I’ve missed this ngl
YouTube launched Jeffree’s career, to be so blunt and bitter about it is a little shocking. It’s almost like a smack in the face to his followers.  It’ll be interesting to see where this goes. Is it a stunt for views, etc
Im so excited ti watch omggg!!!
i love your series’s they genuinely cure my depression🤍keep up the amazing work :))
I’m very confused on why people cancel people and don’t allow growth. Clearly everyone involved in all of the drama has shown a lot of growth
❤️❤️❤️🤙🏼
Jeffree seems so much happier and healthier😭❤️
Omg such a funny trick with the hummer he loves it and I love he shows it right after mentioning the accident lol
When jeffree pulled the pistol out 😭
I really want to try the jerky
Say what you want about Shane Dawson but this man knows how to film
9:09 "But can I do this? It's a little gay. But I feel like, what would Jeffree do?" ....Put on a wig and a full beat LMAO
I really missed these kinda videos.. Love ya shane ❤️💯
Excited the series are starting back up! Can’t wait for more parts
Thank you for the Murphy song credits easily noticable in the description. Such pretty songs.
Forever love you Shane.
Not the TJmax comment 😅😅
I love that I can tell Jefree is gaying it up for the boys but he's just a normal ass wyoming dude most of the time.
I love the songs you chose for this episode 👍🥰❤️❤️❤️
I'm so happy to see you guys together again!
jeffree is strapped 😭
TE EXTRAÑAMOS MUCHO SHANE!!!!!
Jeffree has a beautiful piece of paradise!
OMG IMAGINE A JEFFRY AND SHANE GHOST HUNTING SERIES LOOOOL
This is iconic. Jeffree is still ridiculous and hilarious. Love you shane!!!
Shane's docs are hands down, my FAVORITE. After working a very stressful job during this economy really gets me down sometimes, so getting home, curling up on the couch, and turning this on, reallllllly changes my whole mindset!!! 💙🥰 thank you guysssss for turning my day around!!
Shane missed you posting so much 💓
Half way through I just absolutely adore you Shane I'm so proud of you 💜
I love the series and the pod cast 🔥💛
Haunted activity!! Yas
So excited to watch this!!! Time to get my ramen noodle!
🥲❤️
Jeffree seems happier and more authentic here. I love it.
okay but look at the biggest youtube channels today- they're still getting massive views. it's not the platform that's dying, it's just older creators getting cancelled.
Missed you Shane!!! ❤️❤️
I literally wait for Shane's video drops like I'm waitin on my daddy to come home 😂🙃
I look forward to every episode 😍
Yay!!!
Overproduced unintressting. You seem so Fake nowadays
Omg, i didn't get a notification! I feel so late 😭😭😭
I gasped when he pulled out the gun Lmaoooooo
I don’t care what ppl say y’all too together is the best feeling I’ve ever had
Oh my gosh you both better sell this palette because if you don't, you're just teasing us aaaallllll!!!!!
Gayneck ranch Jeffree is #Goals. Seriously, want to follow suit & get the hell away from the city.  The world needs this series so badly. I need this. Cheers to days & series gone by.  Jeffree leaving YouTube has me in my feels. LITERALLY got teary eyed. I hate change sometimes. 😭
I’m shocked Jeffery didn’t fly you guys private out there  Update: nvm he clarified they’ve gone green…
Jeffree hauling ass almost 90 down the back roads! 😆
I thought that was Shane singing at 10:37 😳 work
so... does Jeffree wear Yaks Body Spray or nah?                   Hope i made you chuckle with my dad joke ;)
omg Shane I am not even halfway through the video and I cannot stop smiling and laughing!! Also love the pinky while you were holding the gun 😂
This makes my heart melt for you Shane. I adore you videos !! ❤
So excited to watch this! And I'm so glad you're back in your "zone" making these videos and doing what you love and what you was made to do! And most of all I love the happiness and excitement you have now. From, the podcast, to Rylands vlogs, to what you're posting now, you can see joy on your face! Keep being YOU sweetheart! Much love🥰❤️
Love your friendship! Also I’m so surprised about Jeffree’s news!
I swear if the entire beginning is Shane hyping a boom moment then it’s not in this episode… ngl I’ll still tune into the next episode
Proud to see Shane on an airplane!!! It’s my biggest fear, and I have the WORST panic attacks whenever I do. If you could do it, I could do it!!!!
I can't imagine what it would be like to be successful at everything you touch. Jeffree is an incredible business person.
All I want for Jeffree is happiness. From Shane's video where he shared his scars I've felt so broken when he crossed my mind. I've always supported him and always will. People do and say hurting things as a cope for the pain they feel.  We Are All Humans. I wish nothing but happiness for Jeffree, Shane, Ryland and ALL of their friends, family and staff. 💜❤
The paranormal activity line!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
'The Cancelled Pallet' is a NAME.
sitting in bed with chicken nuggets on my lazy day, i’m ready shane!! ❤️❤️❤️
So hyped ma man
Their energy together is so magical. It’s unmatched.
I love you Shane ❤️ your stuff is always so entertaining.
I love your content and love that you never ever gave up doing what you love! I'm so excited to see the rest of the series and everything that has yet to come!
Watching this while putting my baby to sleep, thank you for posting Shane, I needed this tonight❤️
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE!??? A new Shane Dawson video??? Time to get comphy and tell everyone to not bother me for the next hour! Thanks in advance, my day needed this 😁
Wyoming being haunted then Shane talking about the pits of hell already being open lmfao
Ok NEWS to me, the conspiracy pallets at txmaxx??? I didn't GOOD $ on that when it released lol
Yes!!! I love this video. Thank you so much! You are all beautiful lights in this world. I actually cried watching this. 😢Jeffree is so great. Thank you for this video
I had to stop following Jeffree because of the gun bullshit.
That 0 to 60 was awesome!
The end is so sad... like, I fully get it but it's still sad 🥲
I’m so glad he’s being so respectful and hey hilariously funny at the same time I love Jeffree doing that accent that doesn’t even match lol
The way I stopped everything to watch this and I’m not disappointed. You were an era that was my comfort and I missed this❤
"This f***** somehow got one" I'm crying laughing, yay gay agenda!
Love you shane ! Keep doin ur thang!
Bitch I still have ur pallet n hoodie
I wish Shane and Jeffree we're my best friends they crack me up
Wait you’re actually alive gAWD damn finally 😊
SHANE YOU JUST MADE MY DAY!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!
AGHHH I CANT WAIT TO GET OFF WORK SO ME & MY ROOMMATE CAN WATCH EPISODE TWO AGHHHH!!!!  ALSO SHANE PLEASE LABEL YOUR EPISODES 😂😂 We tried to go back and rewatch old documentaries but couldnt figure out the order and YT kept autoplaying the wrong next one 😂😂 like "episode 1, episode 2" would be so fuckin great thanks !! 🙏E 😂😂😂
Rylands airport outfit is one of the more “normal” outfits I’ve seen him wear, yet he was freaked out thinking it was too much. Haha I love his chaotic energy.
They r such good friends it’s crazy
We are at the point in history when Jeffree Star is less materialistic and down to earth then the kardashians and I’m SOOO Fucking proud of him!!!
Oh boi this is gonna get fun 😂
Seeing Shane and Jeffree hug again cured my depression 💯🙌🏼😍😭
I love seeing Shane and Jeffree together. It makes my heart happy. ❤
*everyone just sitting in Jeffery's truck*  Jeffrey:  *Pulls out a whole ass silenced pistol*
Been dieing for another episode
I love gun-safety Jeffree hahahaha. EPIC REUNION
where’s Shane’s Netflix show cus imma need one
I needed this 🥹❤️ I’ve been going through it
I was SO not ready. The ending of an era, the turning of a page. I hope this next chapter for Jeffree is full of many more smiles than tears!
GO DAWGS IN WYOMING
I'm loving the series so far! Thank you for uploading!
Yayayayayay
This is amazing
Jeffree looks so good with eyebrows and no make up!:D Idk,he looks so refreshed,natural,happy,down to earth,chill now. Love it! Happy you guys are back 🤍 good luck 🤍
also, the music added: Mason Murphy - Fix Myself and Wrong Direction are sooo good!!
Go to 11:30 that's when the video actually starts.
WHAT
I’m so glad Shane is posting again! I missed his videos ❤
Time flies when your farming! 🤪
OmFG
Omfg!!! I love the friendship! I’m jealous cause I want to be friends with the Queen, Jeffree Star!!! Xxx 🥰😍😘✌️❤️🌈
this makes me so happy 🥲
Rylands hair looks amazing, full, and fluffy!! 🥰🥰
I love you guys and the realizations Jeffree making this is so much for better and I’m glad he’s not focused on what people are saying and how they’ll react that so attitude needs to rub off on Shane I love you both so much and I just wish he could find peace like Jeffree has seemed to I think it will come once he has his baby!
Love that Jeffree is strapped 🇺🇸 ❤
Hes right though
So excited for this series. I’m sure the perpetually offended are ready to find an issue, but there are so many fans very happy about this. Love you & Jeffree together.
The sweat patch literally looks like Shane & Rylan holding hands x
Jeffrey look like a man wow 🌸✨
I miss you posting often😭😭
is he becoming a real she now? just watched like 3 mins of the video so far and its all i can think of that fits
Hope this one is easier to follow 😂
We stan a 2a safety queen!
Shane you are absolutely a beautiful soul & never let anyone tell you differently. ❤
not feeling the music choice in the begining
Ever since the last series I’ve been wanting Shane and Jeffrey to do another one but always had this feeling that it wasn’t going to happen until now. I love you guys both!! ❤ And haters are going to hate there’s no avoiding that but they’re also showing you support too because they’re talking about you so I love you Shane, I love you Jeffrey and I wish you guys all the best😘
Naur
👏🏽🙌🏼👏🏽❤️
❤❤❤
oh my god new series YAS
It’s amazing how much Jeffery has grown !
made this year better with you uploading
Omfg 8 mins in and I'm so annoyed 😒 Ryland ..ugh I just don't like him. 🙊 More Shane less ryland
So happy for you Shane getting back where you deserve and need to be and getting back to the views you deserve and should have every video almost 3 million views in a week 🎉  so happy to see this
Ahhhhhhh yay so excited to watch
The fact he rolls around with that Jesus lol
Jeffrey, doesn't having those talons on your fingers all the time drive you insane?? I've never understood why people like to have polished  velociraptor talons. Imagine accidentally scratching yourself too hard, ouch! A simple French manicure would do the trick!
I guess it really is true that after you have so much its no longer about survival money just stops making you happy 😢
why do i feel like the big news is that jeffree is selling the company lmao
I was NOT expecting that 0-60 moment holy shit
Love you Shane ❤
Honestly this makes me happier than I thought it would. Glad to see everyone back together and see everyone doing their own things successfully.
shane holding a gun has got to be the most uncomfortable I've ever seen someone holding a gun
Well we are clicking.  But....Okay. I take back a comment I made on part 1. Jeffree got it. He figured out what Life is really about. Proud for him....Shane, maybe Colorado is your new journey.  Sell the LA place. Stay with your Mom. Spend quality time with family when you visit CA ❤️ 💕
I legit just finished the first part wtf 😭😭😭✋
omg imagine jeffree swinging his gun instead of a star mirror 😂
When Jeffree pulled out the piece 😭😭🤣🤣 I love that you two are back together ❤️😭
Jeffery “never point the gun towards anybody” Shane nervously shaking while pointing gun down directly at Jeffery’s crotch 💀💀
Absolutely not! I still love YouTube! 😭😭 and I know a lot of people still do!
I love Jeffree!  Idc how many times he is cancelled, he's human.  Humans make mistakes, just like all of us.  It makes me Happy him and Shane are friends!  Love them together!
Jeffree with the trigger discipline 😍
Respect to Jeffrey evolution…. Perfect ending.
“I had a nightmare that I offended Christy Carlson Romano and she came for me” 😂
I am actually so happy to see this.
Why does Shane Look and act like my mom
But isn't it kinda dangerous that Jeffree's adress is on this video? No hater just honestly wondering. Much love
OMG 21:51 hahahahahhahah
I like this Jeffree
I love Shane but this series ain’t it. Nobody wanted this is
61k views in 25min BABBBBYY!!!!!! He Kills it every time!!!🔥🤯
This video ending made me extremely sad.
Slay Shane, I hope you keep having fun and have a great life with Ryland and hope that Jeffree can be part of it too ❤️ (outside of YouTube that is)
Tell me why when Shane waved at the end of his Intro...I started to wave back?!! Hahaha, he just has THAT face, ya know...
Yes Shane! Yes!
Miss this! Miss Shane being in his creative jam, miss being excited for a new video every week, all of it! Keep going!❤️
I love you Shane.
Love "new" Jeffree! Still love the "old" him also!
It’s the cleanest air yet Maddie  can’t breath and then Jeffrees gun omfg this is the best
Seeing how much Jeffree cares about you guys is so heartwarming I don’t know why but I got emotional when he grabbed the luggage and was talking about picking you up in the hummer!!!
I’m so proud of you Shane ❤️
😆 🤣 😂  Jeffree with that gun and silencer! Wow 😆
Those are my first (and only lol) Gucci shoes and I never wear them (scared to get them dirty) but maybe I’ll start wearing wearing them for Shane and Jeffree
Hi Shane love you and love everyone, hot tip: if you’re afraid of turbulence sit directly on the wings or closer to the front! You’ll feel much less as you would in the back of the plane ❤
Stop laughing after every sentence please
Shane ... Help ... I recently started a relationship and she's totally against you and I can NOT  In allllllvery many years I've been a fan/follower (whatever Kool now if lol ) , PHATHOM in anyway why ??? 🙃🙃🙃🙃

Keep doing wat u loveeee!
Please do a part two palette
Every single time Shane uploads, I get so excited. I get so hyped and I've been watching him for over 9 years. Never ever miss an upload.
I missed you and your goofiness! Shane, I have never left you and never will, same as your shirt <3
Was I the only one who cried when Jeffree walked in the airport and saw Shane ... UGH!!
Who's here before 70k:*
Chris sleeping on the plane, after all the excitement of traveling wore him out.. is the sweetest thing 🥺 you're the cutest being Chris!
Watching from Indiana and LOL
The intro!!
Currently watching this while I take a shit. I had Taco Bell earlier!
Man I feel for Jeffree in this one because like he really did take a hit from the backlash
When Jeffree pulled out the gun. 🤣🤣🤣
In every relationship there’s a Shane and there’s a ryland
Omg yesss thank you for posting I miss you and your videos 💗
Love Jeffree supporting our birth rights of being able to carry and protect ourselves! It should be like this everywhere!!!!
I was like oh boy what fresh hell is this series going to be... And then I was like ok ok, this is kinda wholesome. Maybe these guys have grown.. *JEFFREE PULLS OUT A GUN WITH A SCIENCER AND EVERYONE'S LAUGHING LIKE IT'S FUNNY* 😳 Yeah.. I'mma head out.
My god I have missed the energy of these two together
God id luv to meey yall before i die
jeffery went from makeup-brush in the lambo to glock in the hummer real quick
The music choice is amazing as always ❤
Denver airport? Fitting for Shane.
Are we getting more of these? 😊
No but really this move was THE best thing to ever ever happen for J!! He deserved this new start, new story. So did you guys. I’m over here so emotional, I’m so happy you’ve all came back to us in your own way/time.
Will have to watch after kiddos in bed!! But wanted to pop on and say I can’t wait!!!
I love you guys so much!!!!!
I’m only 20 minutes in and I can’t even stop smiling, Shane and Jeffree as a duo are literally everything
Haven't watched yet saving it until later tonight lol excited
16:30 Wow, Jeffree will make a stellar entrance ANYWHERE
I don’t know how to feel ab this.. I don’t think anyone was prepared
Lord you scared me 🥴.
I was like what’s blucifer doing there??? But then i remembered they live in Colorado now 😂 man i would love for Shane to do a video on the Denver airport
So glad I called in sick to work to make sure I could watch this ❤
Jeffrey’s quitting YouTube OMG that is so sad 😭❤️
I just love how YouTube hides my favorite channels from me. I actually have to search for my top channels. Anyone else? Love Shane and Jeffree so this is great. PS: I still love YouTube because I don’t understand TikTok…because I’m old 👵🏼
First off literally such good editing skills and the music you use literally always pulls me in and just brings good vibes!!
❤️❤️❤️so stoked to see you happy and excited to make videos again❤️❤️❤️❤️
years after the pallette launch of conspiracy, ive managed to find a pig print hoodie, still searching for a pig mirror, i love you guys so so much and you guys give me so much motivation <3
Love when people realize people can change. Love the growth of shane and jeffree ❤️
Yay so excited!!! Let's get back on trending! Like & comment lol.
Four is a crowd and someone shoulda stayed home.
Am I dreaming?
I haven't seen the whole video an i already know im going to love it 🥰🥰😃😍😃😍🤩🤩🤩💥💫❤️‍🔥💯
Good lord this Video exemplifies everything I loved about Jeffree Star
I came here to watch this and looked up Shane's name only to not see a single video from him, just tons of cancel culture drama channels being blood sucking leeches. It was so disheartening.
i literally started crying omg.
I've never touched a gun and I feel like Shane's reaction is 100% how I'd be 🤣
Buffy is ridiculous expensive. 😢
I’m so excited for part 2! I absolutely LOVE seeing you doing so GREAT!!! The way you’re just living life to the fullest and doing the absolute best for you and your family… like you’re just in such a wonderful place and it’s so great to see!!!! 🖤💞🖤💞🖤
What tj max ! I wish I would
I saw another comment saying exactly what I was so ready to write!🤣 I’ve watching you guys for so long and seen the long way you’ve come so far and I get so happy seeing Shane so happy and overall more relaxed about everything! This series is so good and it’s not even over!🥰🥹 So proud of you Shane!
I love you, I have been watching you for years and have seen you grow so much. I can never express how proud I am of you, I look up to you so much because growing up I didn’t have a very good childhood. But seeing you always made me so happy as a kid. You are my comfort, so thank you so much❤
The glares from old people behind them at the Wyoming Airport, I can't-
Aw cool I’m pretty early 😊
“He doesn’t eat the ones with names, and I have a name. So I’m fine “ 😂😂😂😂💀
lowkey glad the series are back, love to see the growth❤️‍🩹
When Jeffree walked into the airport I giggled so hard! Love these two together
Bless Ryland and his outfit change!
Retirement!!!???
The way Jeffree struts into the airport like he owns it.😂💞 I missed these videos so much. Fuck cancel culture.🖕
I GASPED
Shane holding the gun, I literally just laughed til I cried b*tch!! I cannot I don’t ever want this series to endddd
Anxiety the house just waiting for this video. Waahhh!!
Lets gooo  also ty for Buffy .... WE LOVE IT! Since we are the same and me and my partner with hot and cold etc.
Perfect just in time while I eat my soup
Yessss i was waiting so patiently.
Love the new series <3
I was on edge a few minutes in! So glad you’re doing what you love again 🥰  Umm… I need that palette though!
I'm so excited! Thanks Shane! Tell Chris 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I just adore him!!!
So mysterious.. What could Jeffree be planning?! Oh wait it's the title of the video.
17 minutes ago WHATTTT?!?!
What what!! I made it to the highlight of my life! A new Shane video!
Shane U make me happy when I am sad . Thank you
They are them. Yes. Love jeffree.
Im so proud of you king. Im so excited for this. I love you ❤ I’m so happy for you
Qince Jeffree broke up,everything change in him..Or maybe he is rediscovering himself
💜
"The cancelled palette" I know he did not just tell us the name of the new product they're about to drop 😂
Welcome back
Seeing Jeffree and Shane together melts my heart! Shane, I'm enjoying the series so much, the water works always say hello when seeing you two together! Jeffree and Shane, we love you both!!
Omg yes
I think cancel culture need to go away now, people need to grow up. I am so glad they are back. 💕
12 minutes in, and good lord I love Shane’s editing. Love this so far ❤ (edit: AND MY BOY CHRIS! killing the videography)
Love ya Shane and jeffree star ❤
I just realized you live near the Denver airport. Please do an in-depth conspiracy video about it!
And yeah hahaha you know when your in the back country when they ask you not to spit your tobacco in the urinals!!🤣🤣🤣
oouu yea
Yes! This is a great way to end my birthday!😊
Shane if you see this , I love you
Rylan, “should I wear this? It’s a little Gay.”  Also Rylan: married to a man. 😆 they are so funny
We need to learn to accept jeffree star and Shane for who they are and they are good people
I love this genuine friendship y'all two have may God continue to bless y'all lives with peace and abundance 💕💯
You guys are the best!
ain't no way i'm this early??? insanity
Jeffree: I can't believe we're actually going to show our baby. To feel so excited about something and then to have such disappointment has been a lot.  My Parents: SAME!
The new WWJD.. What would Jeffree do? -Rylands 2022!
I'm so happy watching this!!!!! I love you Shane & Jeffree!
Yay
Awe jeffy boy is so sweet. Getting there luggage being like come on bitches.
My mental health had literally at been at its worst and I needed the distraction 🖤 side note can’t wait for the psychedelic circus launch I will be buying everything like always 😅
I cant wait for Shane and Jeffree to break the internet again!
You’ve been such a big part of my life, I’m so happy you continue to do what you love and continue sharing it with us along the way ❤
Love the intro music. Takes me back!!!
Great job 👍 Most entertaining. Cool pad bru.
I’m glad they’ve both done the work to get better and be better people. People deserve the chance to change. I see that in both of them.
I enjoyed part 1 so much!!! So happy to see more series!! Much Love Shane ❤️
So let me get this straight.. are they trying to sell us a 2 year old palette?
❤❤❤
Hey Shane my man I love you
Shane I’m so glad you’re making these again!!! It’s making my lifffeee
I’m so excited for this!! I’m so happy to have Shane videos again. YouTube didn’t feel right without them.
This is my favorite thing right now. You've given me something to look forward to!
Bro tbh I used to be a big fan but these videos are boring and and unnecessarily extra
It’s hilarious to see all of the gullible clowns who actually believe that Shane is genuine about being interested in makeup lmao he wasted no time to insult that same community but I guess y’all forgot about that. This is the most obvious quick cash grab I’ve ever seen. Shane knows that this is an easy way for him to make money and that is the only reason he is doing this. I’m sure he will take a few photos again of his makeup “obsession” that does not exist 😂 just like last time.
Shane 😍
"I love traveling,  just not with Elton John over here."
Ryland and his Elton John glasses! 😆 🥰
Loving this series, love your work Shane!! You never disappoint with your videos ❤️
Shane please do more videos, even just once or twice a month, we miss you.
When it comes to views for other creators who talk about Shane and Jeffree in their videos, all I can think is the Papis Home song from Drake’s Certified Lover Boy album.
Love this video!! 🤗🥳
I Love u Shane u are an Icon loveeeeeeeee
I’m so ready! We love you guys
So I just had a mean urge to deep clean my house just needed something to watch/ listen to and boom this drops 🙃
I looked forward to this all week <3 Your videos always make my life so much better, thank you so much :)
Im just so happy to be seeing both of them making a video again 😢❤❤❤❤❤
Here we go again!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
shane wearing gucci shoes to the gym is so ironically hilarious in so many ways
jefree's natural eyes though are so mesmerizing
Im so excited you’re uploading again 😭 I’ve been refreshing your channel for the past 20 mins 🥲
you have more fans than haters remember that. x
2nd part let's gooo! :)
❤
I wanna hug Shane so bad 😭✨ I wanna meet him so so badly it is my dream!!😭✨
NGL thought that was Aaron Carter in your thumbnail.
literally been sitting here stalking all of your socials to see when you were gonna post, YOURE 12 MINUTES LATE
“I like traveling, just not with Elton John” 💀
Not Christi Carlson Romano!
Ryland killed me. Oh my God we got to check the weather That sentence 👌
Ryland saying wwjd what would Jeffree do is everything
I was here 56 seconds in and there were 565 comments. Holy shiiii 😅😅😅
im so early omg
Been waiting for this!! Thank you Shane!
Never heard of Buffy but imma check them out
YES. IM SO EXCITED
let's gooooo! ❤️
I love you 😂😭♥️
Congrats on getting a sponsor! I will buy soon ^.^
❤❤❤❤❤
Fuck cancel culture, you guys should be more based. The based community will welcome you with open arms 😉 Usually woke people are extremely annoying, but I actually find Shane to be funny and likeable. I do miss the edgy humor, but he's still alright in my books regardless
I don’t understand cancel culture, people make mistakes and people dwell in the past to much sometimes. Much love for Shane and Jeffrey!!!
The fact That he got the yaks as pets so he was going to use them for meat and then says it their family and pets like his Pomeranians but then now he sells for meat clearly profit matters more to him
🎉🎉🎉Thank u Shane
The word retirement has me shook!! I'm so excited to watch this!!! I need this palette!!!!!
Every time I watch you Shane, I’m just so glad to see you back ❤
I was always supportive of your content and still am. I've been watching your videos since i was 16 and now im 24. Always supported you and your growth.
Vegan makeup and makes a yak burger from his yak farm 😆🤣
Love your videos Shane xxx love from  UK
Love you and missed you Shane, so glad to see you back 🥰❤️❤️
We love you 💖
Your energy with Jeffree is electric ⚡️ I’m living for this friendship and I always will 💯🖤 we still stand with y’all!
Please don’t stop filming videos and documentaries! I literally love every single one so much. WE LOVE YOU SHANE and I DON’T CARE WHAT YOUR DEPRESSION SAYS…..I know I’m right 😂❤
So honored to have known you since the beginning, watching you rebirth and evolve has been so inspiring to witness.
WHO ELSE IS HATE-WATCHING LET'S FUCKIN' GOOOO
Having just found out my 14 year old daughter has been diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis a week ago and having to inject her with medication for the next 2 years and this video popping up and her and I loving shane and jeffree for years makes all the stress go down knowing we can enjoy something together makes my day feel better. ❤️
Ryland blocking everything not to see the drama is just perfect!! 😂
❤❤❤
Really funny to see Jeffree chilling out to do basically what I want to for retirement, in a quiet town, living a more down to earth and with nature life, and most of all, SUPER AWAY FROM PEOPLE LOL
Omg omg omg is time
love you shaneeee!!!
1:47 fucking hold the camera steady! Just stop with the shaking and random zoom!
when ever shane posts i just get happy especially a doc.
My Buffy comforter is coming tomorrow…can’t wait!!!!  Omg obsessed with this video!  It’s so crazy how both of your lives have paralleled and you both live in the country now with hairy animals and are way happier!  ❤😂
few mins in and got the feeling jeffery is going to stop makeup.Fumming but happy for him the same time ❤
Yes! The king has blessed us with another amazing video! I have been checking to see when you posted the next vid. You are really making these long hours at the hospital go by much faster. ❤️❤️
I love that you flew to Wyoming from Colorado 😂
Also, Shane’s white jacket makes him look like a Ghostbuster??
i hope they release a new palette, conspiracy had the BEST colors.
shane posting again is giving me life <3
I'm glad it seems like you're putting all the nonsensical bullshit people have given you aside and just getting on with your life again.
OMG IS YOUR PALETTE THE ONE JSTAR JUST DROPPED? IS THAT GOING TO BE THE SURPRISE?!?!?!?! 😳😁😁
My shift suddenly feels sooooo long
Dude I’ve been waiting all day!! Love you guys!! This shit is better than cable lol.
In the UK, we stay up late for Shane's videos 😁
Cant wait till my lunch break
❤
Jeffree is such good value 🤣🤣
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
WHY IS JEFFREE GIVING BLACKBEAR VIBES?
I’m pretty surprised by the title 😮
I love any video you watch Shane! ❤ always have and always will! I hope you release a new palette!! 🙏🏻
Omg I love his videos so much it makes me so happy to see him so passionate with every series he makes ❤😅
==AHHHHHH
I am so hyped for this series, I don't care what the dumb haters say.
I’m so glad you and Jeffree are back at it. Keep it up ❤

The audible camera lense 😬
Love you! I live for every video you make😂😍

4:30 that pinging noise made me think an alarm I never heard before was going off on my phone
The look on Shane's face when Jeffree shows him a little self protection 😂😂😂

YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ❤
❤️
52:45 - 54:38 I've never seen jeffree be so "real." Wild.
Click bait ??
We can now confirmed the *Conspiracy Theory* that you can survive after being cancelled.
Pls do like true crime videos or something  I love watching you. But it’s just the same jeffree stuff 😢❤
Missed you Shane 💕
Finally!!!!!!🎉🎉
I'm enjoying this. So happy Shane is doing things like this again!
Pls do like true crime videos or something  I love watching you. But it’s just the same jeffree stuff 😢❤
I have never wanted this so bad
This about to be crazy
7:07 that’s good you do not need a mansion Jeffrey love him 💙💙
i hope this second episode is worth the watch!
So predictable this two part series was leading up to the launch of a palette!! All the fans like “yeah please release this” Shane pretends to be coy and like no don’t be silly we can’t do that…………..hey presto as if by magic Palette gets released!  All those ready made shades about to go off in the warehouse so needs to be sold now or they lose a lot of money 😂😂
I can't explain how happy I am to be seeing these videos again 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m not even half way through and I’m getting anxious and feel like I’m going to throw up. I hope this isn’t what I think it is. Helppppppp!!!
Been an inspiration to me for such a long time, watching you really brings the best out of me, we all love you Shane!
I’m sooo sick 😢 this couldn’t have come at a better time. I’ve been dying on the bathroom shower floor all morning. Thank you Shane! This is the cheer-me-up content I needed today.
is it just me sat there refreshing at 2pm pst because i need to watch asap? x
me, when my friends try to make plans: “i don’t know, I’m a lot of energy right now, and like 20lbs more than you’re used to. “
I LOVE YOU SHANE. Thank you for returning to YouTube. ❤️
its finally up❤️❤️❤️❤️
At my second job trying to watch this and the register at the same time! I literally can’t wait! Shane and Jeffree we are so happy to have you both in a long awaited series!!
Just saying hi, I am here ❤😂
so excited!!
didn't bruh get "cancelled" lmfao ion got a prob w him but im honestly surprised ion see negative comments
“I had a whole self awareness moment, wanted to be grounded” decides to raise animals to kill them, carry guns etc 🤦🏻‍♀️
I have been following your career since the beginning, so proud of what you’ve accomplished Shane ❤ Jeffree is an inspiration and I’m so glad you all didn’t let all the drama stopped you from making  amazing content ❤
❤❤❤❤ so happy you are back !
I went on the Buffy website and when I was in checkout it said itll give it to me as a free trial but it doesn't give me the option to not take the free trial 😬
Ryland in the all black fit- so fucking slay.

This series, and your podcasts are the ONE thing I look forward to everyday! You are my idol. Continue being amazing. 💖💖
He was laaaaate!
Yay!  So glad to see Jeffree Stars Face again.  Been missing it !
Bunch of gay guys everywhere. Multiple bunches of gay guys everywhere. I'm gayverwhelmed
So proud of how far you have come!
I love whenever you a Jeffree do anything, keep them coming !
I'm so excited to watch!
“I’ve been holding this body on my shoulders and I’m tired!” - Shane….. and also, MEE!!!

This is a friendship I’ve always loved and found so funny. I missed you guys so much together 🥹
I just got fired from my job today out of nowhere. This is hands down one of the worst days of my life. So watching this will help bring some joy in my life and Shane I only wish you and everybody watching this the very best.
Omg I've been counting down the fucking days, hours and seconds!!!!
Jeffree star was retired when he started selling his dead animals meat
Thank you shane for posting.. I just got really down because I’m working out so hard and watching what I’m eating and the scale is just going up! And it’s not muscle because I have a scale that tells me body fat and muscle percentage… the muscle percentage is going down and fat is going up!! And I’m not even losing inches either 😭😭😭 I’m sooo sad and idk if I can keep doing this… I hate myself.   Sorry for being depressing but your video brings me joy
It’s ashame how fast I tapped the video I just opened the app 😂❤️
Jeffrees voice over was so fucking calming😍😍
So excited.
KEEP EM COMING SHANE!! I’m so happy to see you continuing to create videos for all of us. Seeing your growth is so heart warming
No matter what’s said about this man he makes the best Fuckin content and always has
Who allowed you arond cats?
You and Jeffree’s friendship is iconic 💖 love you both always!
