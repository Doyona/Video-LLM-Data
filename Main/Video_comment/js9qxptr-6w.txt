You’re first video with over a million views in so long!!!!
Hey are you from Tennessee
I’m happy your happy ❤️
I've Subscribe To You
Even if you did decide to move on from gaming and do something different your fans would support you 100%. If you were to just up and leave we would be sad but we would understand. You are one of the best content creators out there Tyler. You're creative, funny, and your videos are nice to watch after a long day of dealing with life. I don't know if you worry about people liking you because of VanossGaming but even without his help, I think you would have done fine regardless because you don't just ride off of his success or content, you strive to be your own person and do your own things. You and your friends are one of a kind and I know it'll be that way until the end. I think I speak for everyone in this thread when I say I'm proud to be your fan.

Influencers in the wild. A bit cringe for me, but I'll still be here watching this channel.

Honestly stoked for you bud. You do a lot of cool shit outside of gaming and I can’t wait to see all the trouble y’all get into 😂
It ain’t got no gas in it
hellllll yeaaaaaa
Got scared. This is awesome Tyler!
The reason why he managed to say relevant and maintain a decent amount of views is cause he actually has a funny and entertaining personality
Has anything been announced about the wildcast? I loved it so much, but I struggle to keep up with announcements on YouTube and twitter 🥺
Yes! Let's fucking go
I subscribed to see those calendars get destroyed
This might be the only clickbait video i genuinely liked… as someone who has watched for over 9 years might even be the full 10, keep hustling Wildcat 🤘🏻

WILDCAT: The Next Generation
Had us in the first half.

Wildcat/Tyler's life is evolving---as it should.  Wishing you much success with the new channel, Tyler.

I was gonna say
Wildcat i want one of the group calendars i never got a chance to get one 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
You scared the shit out of me man
So basically you’re becoming every other cookie cutter wanna be Mr.Beast
I probably won’t support these videos. Although it’s a good step forward if it’s what you want to do.  The reason why is I can’t watch someone living their best lives anymore. I have my own life to worry about and I can’t be comparing it to someone else. That’s why I won’t watch irl content from made people.
Team 6 irl
Im gonna sub to that channel just to support nogla.
I was about to say dude is one of my favs
That scared the fuck outta me
Damn. Tyler's gonna have a very long-lasting campfire with those 17k calendars on the conveyor belt
Glad to see new ideas you had Tyler. Been watching your video for the long time

I can not relate as much as you but I’m loving the vlogs, the vibe hits different than any other vlog I’ve watched it’s just goated 🐐……. You dropped something my dude 👑
Lowkey got baited 😪 CONGRATS TYLER IM DEFINITELY SUBBING
Does anyone know what some that was?
$25 plus shipping and tax for a calendar. Makes sense why it didn't sell out. I was considering buying it to cut apart and turn into wall art. But for some reason racing cats is included in the calendar. And to me he doesn't make sense being there. So he kind of ruined each of the images by being there. If anything Mr Sark makes more sense as a random additional person.
nogla
Maybe he'll play cod with marksman irl
As a gamer of 25 years, I feel ya. Keep it up, brother.
Not gonna lie, he had us in the first half
I just now realized that wildcat made his channel one day before my birthday

ECONOMIC RESET IS COMING. THE MONEY YOU HAVE WILL BE SOON AS WORTHLESS AS LEAVES BLOWING IN THE WIND... COVID 19 AGENDA . ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED IS THE NEXT STEP. THE TIME WILL COME YOU WIL BE "FORCED" TO TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT IT. YOU TAKE HELL ON EARTH IS COMING INTO YOUR LIFE. GODS JUDGEMENT, AND THROWN DIRECTLY INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE FOR ALL ETERNITY' GOD PROMISES TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU. THIS TRUTH CONFIRMS THAT THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU, AND CAN HAVE ETERNAL SALVATION IN HEAVEN, AND NOT HELL.  JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK IN MY LIFE TIME.....

Jesus Christ you fucking scared me Tyler 💀
You, vanoss, nogla, terrorizor. All of you shaped my childhood. All the fun memories I had while watching all of your guy's videos after school. The least I could do is keep on watching. Keep at it m8
Bro I’ve been watch you since I was little🥹
Bro I was going to cry but I’m glad it was something good
if wildcat flew out to me for the play button, i think i would just be excited to show him my truck lmao
bruh you had me shook there for a second
Man for a moment I thought you were done. My heart sank, I have been watching your and Vanoss’ videos since 2012. Every night I watch what ever new content you have uploaded, so I got scared when I saw the title of this video. I will definitely be checking out your new channel. Thank you for the many years of laughter, and thank you for continuing the gaming channel.
hey Tyler, what I would do to meet you man is just, unexplainable. I bought my first house days ago and got a baby on the way as well as just got my first car, and I'm only 20. I don't give a shit about the play button, but maybe someday I can meet you. I subbed, excited to see where your vlog channel goes good sir! love you brotha.
Why would you do that to me man you about gave me depression I watch your stuff all the time 😂😂

youd think after doing the first few vlogs, youd have the idea to make a seperate channel, but i guess waiting a couple of years after the first few is the right way to go if you want to be successful
So a flexing channel?
so.... will the calendars be burned?XD
You scared the shit out of me I thought you was gonna quit making gaming content I really enjoy your content so I avoided this video thinking of the worst I'm so happy your staying much love wildcat keep up the great work

Take a moment to appreciate Tyler. He has been grinding making videos nonstop for 10 years, has made so many damn videos I don’t know how he comes up with new stuff, is famous and rich and can probably do whatever he wants, but he still dedicated his time to entertaining his fans. How fantastic. Thank you, Tyler.

Had me scared for a hot second there. Been subbed since I was in middle school when I first found your channel and I've loved your content since then. I thought for a second that one of the oldest content creators I found and still enjoy to this day was going to be leaving Youtube and it kind of broke my heart a bit, but I'm glad you're here to stay. 8 years of laughter given by you man, I'm glad you're not going anywhere.

Big wildcat tings fuck is you talm bout stay the same wildcat
Scared me for a sec
Wildcat you almost gave me a heart attack at the beginning. I'm so glad your still gonna stay with us
Honestly perfect move for you. Never understood when channels get rid of their bread and butter and take big risks completely changing their channels. this lets you make stuff you really want to while easing your fanbase into new stuff at the same time. im all about it man ive been here since about 2013 and im excited to see what you get up to.
I’m excited for this
I know what wrong with it, ain’t got no gas in it
heck yea 2016 to 2022 has been very great
Scared the shit outta me
I was 10 since I been watching you guys know I am 18 Time flies keep going on vlogs and gaming vids  ❤❤❤
This shit gonna be fire 🗿
And...subbed
Ive been following you since about 2012 and youve made me laugh so much , least i can do is subscribe to that second channel ! Keep it up man
Hell yeah! I’m here for it! Can’t wait to see how this’ll go!
finally I've been loving you irl content a lot can't wait for future irl videos on a channel that's all about rl
Wildcat you’ve been my hero since I was a kid I loved your videos and the crew I swear man and I’m from TN as well I love you brother yee yee yee ❤️😎😊❤️
HELL YEAH 🔥
My heart just dropped 😂had me in the first half ngl
You scared me
Thank god i thought the man, the myth, the legend that ive been watching for 8 years was leaving i was almost heartbroken
bro scared me fr
homie scared me for a sec
Normal people I've been doing this 10 years... need find something new... Me: I've had this job only a year and I'm bored already, new job please.
This looks idea actually has me exciting it’s really cool seeing my childhood you tubers irl
Dude fucking scared me thinking he was quitting YouTube or some shit😂💀
I didn't think you were quiting lol, I wished it would have stayed in this channel to grow to 10 mil, but I can't wait to see all the new content!
Hell yeah!
Phew gave me a bit of a heart attack
The title really has me scared for a moment....😂
Kinda hoping the second channel url wouldve been W1LDC4T2
YOU ASSHOLE. Good prank and this new channel is about to be gangster, thanks for the last 11 years. shout out to more
BEEETT
I’m an editor and cinematographer in Nashville. I’d love to be of help on the videos if needed!
this is probs a bad call, but I still think MW 2 remastered was some of wildcats best recent content... The trickshot and rage compilations... The coops with kryoz smity and legion. I understand the appeal of Fortnite and amogus but IMO not the funniest videos.
Im hyped as hell i love irl content
Almost died in the beginning part smh
Lmao i cant expect wildcat to come to Toledo drop that off some crack head will mug him thinking its real gold 😭😂
WE LOVE YOU WILDCAT💙🤍
Good for you man I'm happy for wildcat, for sure subbing
lord forgive me but I keep pausing the video at 1:54.
Man give me a fucking heart attack. I thought you were quitting. I’ve been subscribed to you for longer than I can remember. Maybe around 9 years ago when I was 8. Never make me think your quitting again
Great way to introduce the irl channel
Bro.. im so glad we can still watch you
I saw the title and thought he was leaving. Almost cried bruh
Destroying friends car? He's been hanging too much with WhistlinDiesel and I'm all for it haha YEA
Lessss gooo still uploading ye
God I hate that you put that as your title I actually thought you were gonna quit
nearly had a heart attack, glad your here to stay!
Glad to say I subscribed at 150k 😂
Gamer goes outside?
Love the crazy shit you do in real life with your friends or by yourself. So for sure subbing.
Lived in texas all my life and met him twice great guy and glad to see him expanding his influence

I thought he was going to move on to Twitch lol
Is sitting in a chair all day, recording yourself playing video games, and paying someone else to edit your videos for you *THAT* hard and stressful...? Bro I'd kill a man for that life.

Bro had me scared
This is crazy I was just thinking to myself the other day someone should make a gaming vlog account if you could find a way to put some video game clips with all your friends in the vlogs without making it a time consuming video then you’d be on to something rather than making a brand new account
Ducking scared me man

I want to see friends and food and all that on the Chanel and I can't wait until I see the irl videos
bruh can't do that to ne man
Phew! Dude you scared me there
I got kinda scared at the beginning
Tyler, Scotty, and Nogla all have new secondary channels, Anthony has been shifting focus from gaming to other stuff, Brock and Brian have been a lot more chill (especially on the SMP minecraft, and Among Us for Moo). It's an interesting time for ye all. Cool to hear it!
Wildcat is probably one of the best guys out there in terms of being a YouTuber and still having a pretty balanced life outside of YouTube. I'm happy for you brother. We'll stick by your side for whatever you want to do, as long as you'll have us around for it. And if you eventually decide not to, all the best to you.
i actually wanted this so bad i always loved your irl content and wanted more so when i tell you that when you said that you are going to do more irl content i actually jumped out of my chair and shouted yes!                      yes im a kid im 16 haha
Hmmm. Maybe instead of destroying the calendars you can give it the subs on other channel. Don't get me wrong see them get burn would be cool maybe roast some marshmallows.
Y’all missing out if you don’t go to that new channel shits funny af
He had us there in the first half... not gonna lie 🤭
This guy had me trippin for a second
What a change, honestly kinda excited to figure out what else will be done on the channel always fun with you around wildcat!
THIS SCARED MME BRO he makes gaming so much better bc he is so funny
Damn brother you had me worried I was wandering what will I do without my favorite American streamer literally
I'm starting to wonder is all the booms we keep hearing over in my part of Alabama have something to do with Tyler blowing shit up.

Camera to the ass.... Classic wildcat

I’m glad wildcat is sticking around but I hope he still enjoys what he does. You know your audience is older now, right? We’re all more mature, by about 10 years. If you gotta step away, we can understand that.  Just do what you gotta is all I’m saying.
So your making the next vivala bam but in YouTube

DANG IT! THE ACTING IS TOO GOOD! I ACTUALLY thought you were leaving for a second.  Tyler, I hate to tell you this, but April Fool's day was a month ago today. Bit late to the party man, come on. XD
He had me at the first half, not gonna lie. But this is exciting! It’s so awesome seeing y’all branch out and experiment with new things while continuing to do the same fun things per usual! Continue living your best life, Tyler!!!!
Damn dude you almost have me a heart attack I'm happy that you're thinking of a change so you don't get burnt out on gaming
Much love to my Tennessee brother. Keep up the fire videos. Damn sure makes my days better
thats huge, ngl always wanted you to make more irl/vlog videos. I always found them enjoyable to watch
Gaming youtube legend to Jake Paul. How the mighty have fallen
I was about to watch the last 10 years of my history on youtube disappear and then realized it's just getting better
Cringe
FYI there is no 12 PM or AM there is 12 midnight and 12 noon.12:01 PM is 1 minute after noon, 12:01 AM is 1 minute after midnight..
I got really scared for a sec ahaha
You can't do that to me man. I'm 37. It is not likely, but more likely I will have a heart attack than your younger fans.
not gonna lie.... Got me in the first half. this man was my childhood. Warms my heart to hear this news! You have yourself a loyal subscriber yet again!
That ass when he's on the dirt bike is Hella thick, work dem cheeks wildcat! Also can't wait to see what you're gonna do with the irl channel.
I love watching the vlogs! I'm excited!
You have my full 100% percent Tyler

thought he was making an onlyfans i am deeply disappointed
1:20 I know what’s wrong with it….
After years of watching wildcat, I'm genuinely happy there's gonna be new chapter in his career 🤝🏼😤
You scared me
I don’t care if I win so long as I get to see how he comes up with various ways of destroying the calendars.
It’s gonna be hilarious if he burns the calanders
SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME 😂
It's my birthday
Did you guys remember the Nogla Group Calender that we didnt sell ?? 😂
I wish Tyler was my dad 😔
why did nogla even make the calendars who even has calendars anymore
I love this
I’ve been loving the vlogs on this channel and wanted to see more so this is an absolute win
LETS GOOOOOOO
subbed the moment you said about your new channel love your videos
background song?
Will watch most of your vids on the new channel but will avoid all of ones with Nogla as still not over something he said.  But glad to know you are happy and doing what makes you happy.  Cheers to that.
The beginning got me worried not gonna lie.
Had me in the first half ngl😅
Tyler you've made me laugh, smile and feel completely better when I feel down or terrible on occasional days. I've shared the crew with many of my friends and they told me that with the crew's videos and amazing humorous videos/jokes (even if there's cursing) that they have felt better even after having multiple stages of depression. I'm so glad that your not deleting the channel, and I hope it does well!  You've done great throughout the years and you made so many people Laugh, smile, open up, get over depression and feel better,  even alone on the crew's own channel's everyone has done the same exact thing. Hope that everything will go just as fine as it did in 2011, 10 years on YouTube that has made people's days better around the globe! Love you "Ty" and thank you for making me feel completely better and this thanks goes out to the whole crew.
Saw that coming, I mean wouldn't matter if he started uploading different content, we are here because we want to see what this nutjob is up to
Damn Tyler, you got me scared there for a minute cause I've been watching you for years, in 2013 when I was little. You were always a good source for entertainment
Scared me man lol. Don’t get me wrong, I want you to be healthy and happy doing whatever makes both. After everything you and your friends did to help me get through some tough times, you deserve to do whatever makes you happy…  But I’m glad to know you’ll still be spoiling us with content. Have a great day to all who might read this, especially you Wildcat. Thanks for everything you’ve given to us.
Lol and Kellys ducks
am i the only one the teared up fr at the end when he said “that’s for being with me all these years” been watching since i was probably 13 or 14 and every time i watch the videos. it takes me back to that perfect moment of childhood fun me and the boys used to have online and in xbox party’s.
LETSSSSS GOOOOOOO so glad we get to see more of the vlog type stuff
Wildcat you fooled me good dude, I thought you were done for good!
Save me a calendar I wanna get one

Oh wow this is gonna be absolutely amazing!
I was actually gonna go in tears. Your my favourite YouTuber and without you idk what I would’ve done
Part of me doesn't want you to hit 100.000 subs, just so that Nogla is stuck with those calendars and you guys can keep making fun of him with them.
I was shiting myself the first 40 seconds I swear😂
I was expecting that raid shadow legends add as he was at the end of sad speech.
This man scared the shit outta me for a second
What ending song is that
Honestly you releasing a irl channel is the best news!
Bruh 17,000 calendars left…
I remember the day where u told Marcel that you’d rather die than start vlogging
👏
Love it man all the best in the future keep up the hard work!
Scared the shit out of me
Hmm... well, I wish you the best with this new channel, I'm sure you'll do great but I think I'll pass. I just wish to have some laughs, watching people play video-games... when it comes to irl stuff, the community... naah... not my kinda thing.
Can’t wait for when you prank Scotty by crucifying him and reciting the entire Christian bible in german
This guy.
April first was last month, you scared me lol
Name of song?
No gas
I thought for a second Tyler was leaving. I was so worried
We need the wildcast
Thank god your not retiring. You are on of the O.G Youtuber videos of the gaming era when there were no snowflakes around compared to today. Congrats man
What Tyler said about the Nogla calendars is so savage and I love it LMAO 😂
Yessir this is awesome. Wildcat’s vlog channel finna be lit and I can’t wait 🔥
This is so exciting! Been watching for 8 years and I love watching irl with your friends!
Big scare there man these fuckers are my childhood 💀
“The Nogla group calendars we didn’t sell” haha
You son of a bitch, I'm in.
I take pride in knowing I was one of the few that ordered the group calendar
Nogla felt a disturbance in the force as soon as that calendar went up in flames
I'll be subbing... because i wanna see you burn a shit ton of calendars
1v1 vanoss to 21 in a game of basketball
Bout shit my pants tyler.. not cool

On the road to 10mill

The keyboard is angled indeed lol
He scared the sh*t out of me
I have to be honest I've been a fan of wildcat and the whole crew since 2012/01/16 and when I thought he's done with youtube I just started imaging everyone starting to end youtube and I saw my whole childhood fall apart.
The amount of people he scared at the start of the video!
What’s next he’s the best gamer, basketball player, and now irl vlog channel
Had me in the first half lol
so a danny duncanesc channel? dope!
Def had us for a bit there, happy to see you doing what you want.
Funny enough 1:35 I bought one haha, quite liked the quality of it.
The thumbnail looks the type of guy that hides body's in the back garden.
Me just listening to the new vid acting casually af: Me after hearing about the Irl channel: (It’s about time)
I fuxking love you let’s goooo!!!
Love ya wildcat!

Gosh dang it man you had us thinking some bad had happened glad you’re staying around man
You made me think that you were ending your channel

I just wanna say, I never believed that you would leave. I knew you’d stay, and I think myself, and everyone else is so goddamn proud of you. You and the whole crew were such a huge part of my childhood and many others, I’m so happy your doing this and your gonna keep going, this is awesome and I couldn’t be happier for you.
Irl content looks lit
Had us in the first half ngl.
Poker night IRL on the new channel would be fun to see, I really enjoyed the poker streams you've done so far
That was some smooth editing! Got hyped! 🔥
Man said just burn the calendars 😭 forget they ever happened
Very happy with this the vlogs have been great
I was tearing up because I thought you were gonna quit and then you said that nothing was going to change on this channel and I was so relieved. I've watched (and enjoyed) your content for a LONG time and I'm just so relieved that you're not quitting
Not gonna lie he had us in the first half
LETS GOOOOOO. I love the irl stuff on this channel so a whole channel for it sounds dope

Finally something productive will be done with those calendars
Lets Fucking Go Wildcat!! Can't wait to see what the future brings!
lol you should have done this on April first would have been a great prank
this edit was soo cold
That bait though, some would call this man the master baiter for such a bait as this
Well I'm happy to hear you're not getting rid the Wildcat Channel, Tyler you have been one of my favorite youtubers for a solid 7 years now, and I feared burnout had overtaken you. Glad you aren't going anywhere and happy that you found a new passion, here's to next 7 years with you and your amazing content.
lit new channel borther
Now this is how to promote a 2nd channel lol
You son of a bitch, you almost had me in tears! I've been here for 9 out of those 10 years. I was 17 when I found you and I'm 26 now, time flies. I forgive you but don't do that shit again mr wildcat lmaoo. Congrats on the IRL channel though, let's go!!
This is a W
Been here since forever and can’t wait for the future
Ur a rat 😂

LIT
Ayoo congrats on the new adventures! Can't wait to see the chaos but this time in real life 😂
You fucking troll lol. Classic Wildcat. Glad to hear you’re expanding your horizon. Hella proud of you dude
This makes me happy. Been watching you for most of your YouTube career and absolutely adore your channel(s). Can’t wait to see what kinds of videos you post over there!
my fuckin heart!!! when he talked about his channel "going.... nowhere" my ass cheeks were tight brother
Believe it or not Wildcat Was Literally My First Step Into Youtube since 2013.
Yo I'm down to see Wildcat ball out 🔥🏀
not going to, lie had me in the first half
Scared me shitless 🤣 congratulations on all your success man love your videos
I love your IRL stuff keep em coming bro!
I was so stressed watching the beginning of this video lord.
oof he scared me for a secound
1: Called it on the IRL channel, super excited to see YOU excited to create again! Glad to see you're following what you want to do! 2: "Remember the calendars that we didn't sell?" Oh yeah it's May 1st, thanks for reminding me to change it to this month lol
Damn dude I almost had a heart attack in the beginning. Never change bro keep uploading what you truly enjoy and will always be here to support you
ty never do that again got me teaqring up
We been waiting for it
i thought you were gonna quit and i was gonna start crying.
I swear for a moment I was worried what happened and then remembered nogla said one day the group was gonna fall and I thought it was coming true since this video came out nvm lol 😂
Just saw Nogla’s clip about how half the groups gonna be gone in 5 years. Then saw this 😹😹😹
Scared the absolute shit outta me the first time around
wildcat is now jackass!
Love to hear it
Lmao I thought u was gonna dip
Wildcat should have a refrigerator box over his mailbox when he records and on that box should say "secret hideout" so he doesn't have to blur it everytime
So proud of this guy right here!!! Been watching him for a long time now and I love his content. This is gonna be big, I know it 🤪🤪🤪
LETS GOOO
Thank fuck. I was actually terrified that you'd quit youtube. You've provided me with so much entertainment over the years, that I'd seriously miss your videos.  The IRL channel is honestly a great idea, since your previous IRL videos were all great.
Man wildcat had me thinking he was quitting
I'm glad he ain't leaving
LETS GO
You can't just do that intro man, really got me gripping my chair
scared me for a sec bru
If only this was posted on April 1st
Wow man, I remember I started watching your videos when you did your first Q&A. I bought your very first merch shirt and I teared up a bit watching how far you’ve come and how amazing your life is now. Keep going homie!!!
Tyler no matter what you do I support you all the way thank you for everything you do on this channel and more
I mean. I'm not too surprised but hey at least he'll be a little more happier while doing youtube. Hopefully nothing but positive things happen. And I got other stuff to do.
I am pumped for the other channel and of course the future content on this one!
Let’s gooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I have NEVER been so stressed and upset to absolutely excited and happy so quick in my life
I thought he was gonna quit YT

YOU HAD ME PISSING MYSELF YOU *******😭😭 bro I thought you were ending YoUr CaReEr 💀 I’m so happy you’re not ending the channel and whatever you have in store for all of us we support you all the way❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've actually liked the vlogs man I've been waiting for this LFFFGGG!!!
Just subscribed to the channel tyler much love bro thank you for inspiration on random shit
you had me thinking there and i was losing it
Hope you’re enjoying making content, we know you haven’t really enjoyed recent game installments so we’re glad (and thankful) that you’re still making content for us GG’s
You might of done a better job of fooling people into thinking you were leaving YouTube, if you hadn't mentioned that you were working on a Blog Channel in one of your other videos (or was it one of the other guys videos?). Just saying.
I’m really fucking excited for his new Chanel been a fan since I was 14 and I’m 21 now
I am definitely going to subscribe !! 🤭
Tyler, I do enjoy your gaming content.
Love the idea I hope it all works out! Hopefully get to meet you all one day
Glad to hear your not going any were as i love your gaming vids but i honestly love your IRL stuff maybe a bit more as seeing you be you is the most fun. Anyway much love and keep safe
I can already hear Nogla screaming his head off when he sees Tyler buy all the calendars then proceeding to burn them all.
Bro I could see this man being a CEO of an esports team.
Well I had a feeling he was going to expand a bit, I'll support you though I love that content.
Hey tyler instead of burning the calenders can you send me 1?
Please don’t give you away your plaque
he had me in the first half ngl
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF US
LETS GOOO!!!
Brooo u had me scared damn pffffff i thought no more among us :(
I was about to riot
Tyler, you’re the best. Been watching you for 9 years, and the videos always remained consistent. You always kept doing you, blocking out the garbage other youtubers typically fell into. Appreciate the  IRL vlog channel, I remembered when you tweeted years ago asking us if we wanted to see a dog and car vlog, to which I got excited but you never did it. Glad you do vlogs, made a channel for it, and are keeping things the way they are with your channel. I can honestly say you are the one youtuber where every new video you upload has me excited. Since 2013, seeing you upload made my day better. Keep doing you. Best of luck on the vlog channel! 🔥❤️
time to win a playbutton
whys the channel pfp Blank??
all these comments are from kids who dont even watch the videos. video is 2 minutes long and they couldnt watch it before commenting
I’ve been supporting this guy as a member for over 2 years and as a subscriber for 6. Will gladly support this new channel
Y won’t see this lol but u scared a lot of niggas foresureee 🤣🤣
THE CALENDAR LOL
Look forward to the vlogs brother!
Hell yeah baby can’t wait for the vlogs
Everyone out here thinkin Wildcat was leaving but nah he was just gonna make bangers on a second channel
Much love wildcat <3
Lmao when you destroy the calenders you should get Noglas reaction 🤣🤣
Why couldn’t you have done this on April fools day
At least someone is buying the calendars
I was abouta lose it if you said you were retiring
Mf you scared me
Ayo! Awesome. Glad to hear that you've made another channel.
I've been duped i was so convinced he was retiring
Knew he was bouta bring the bangers🎵
I’ve been saying to myself I wanna see more blog from all of y’all.
Damn gave me a heart attacj
This man had me stressing about this day for so long just to me me excited about his new Chanel 😂
My heart was dropping at first lmao. Literally 12-current (20)  I’ve watched these videos. Still my favorite
Tryna give me a heart attack bruh 😂
I don’t need any proof to subscribe to the new channel.
Aye, I did that with my calender
I would love watching that channel im always here for u man I appreciate this so much :)
I don’t get it… why do people have to make new channels that they hope to grow when they already have a massive channel. Wildcat has almost 8 Million subs who will most likely be moving to his new IRL channel. He is just shrinking his audience size to post different content that his subs on here will already enjoy. Most of the subs on the other channel will be from this channel anyway.   If anyone sees it differently, please let me know, I just don’t get it.
Well to be honest, that wasn't worth the suspends, the 3 minute countdown was awesome, Yelp. God Bless You and Jesus Loves you.
Had me in the first half ngl 😂
L
Thank you for not leaving Tyler. Your content has brighten my day multiple times throughout my adolescence. I already subbed
Let’s go!!!!

I was honestly wondering what this video was gonna be about, now I am more excited than ever for these IRL video, I love the vlogs that you make every now and then, keep up the work!
I knew you wouldn’t decide to quit
Fcuking hell wildcat thought you quitting.
woohoo I subscribed
So hyped for this new channel
Bro you don’t even understand I was sooooo hoping for this. Yes Wildcat I’m ready for this 💪🏾
Tyler you almost gave me the big depression, glad to see you are still going to be around
Bro you had me worried
He had us in the first half, NGL.
I was scared for a minute
Bruh this man is a clickbait machine… I love it

I’m curious what the story is behind the flipped car. Can’t wait man, congrats on all the progress!

Tbh I thought he was gonna take a month off just for himself
I was so scared
So so sick. Been wanting this for a while. Can’t wait to see what’s in store

No more delay
💯
dropping his own game?
New Logo? New Name? New somthing what could it be????
I just want my appearance here on the record so… Hi everyone 👋
Probably a tour or something, whatever is is… very excited!
Alpha beta?
if this is the end man i just want to say thank you for everything Tyler! youve gotten me and so many others through tough times! couldnt ask for a better Youtuber, thank you for all the laughs and you have our full support!❤️💯
Ngl im genuinely worried.
Has anyone else gotten an ad for GTA 6 recently?
wildcat has sadly passed away. sorry guys.
wedding?
His most recent video's intro is a tease that he might be leaving. The black profile picture and banner is kind of strange too.
I hope it has to to something with the WILDCAST or with AlphaBetas. It's gotta be
SAME
New Glitch Flavor Dropping
It is definitely a big project either new channel big merch drop or something else
i highly doubt it's his retirement man pulls in stacks from YT it'd be stupid to just quit now Edit: haha I called it! Can't fucking wait for this new channel
Imagine if this is a " I have a baby on the way " announcement.
HORKIT
Please don't retire I've been watching you for so long man this will be sad for all of us who watched you.
You know this is about to be an absolute BANGER, when  Wildcat got you hanging on to your seat more than a movie
He’s is quitting YouTube
Ooooh...🐷😼👌
I’m now a member!
I’ve been watching Tyler’s videos since 2014 and they entertained me so much and it’s my childhood too
is wildcat getting a baby
im calling it right now, the onlyfans is coming
whatever's gonna happen i hope its for the best
Defo just a new brand logo
He just pushed the time back lol
A four minute long video anything could happen in that much time
Rumors are that Wildcat is retiring. I hope that's not the case, but if it is, then I wish him the best of luck.
Taco
If he retires he needs to be put in a hall of fame
Alpha Betas Ep2.
He's announcing his only fans
I think wildcat is taking a break from youtube for a while
No matter what you say, thanks for the years of content. You owe us NOTHING! Stay positive man! ❤️❤️
I've been watching for many years and hes my favorite youtuber whatever it is it's gotta be great
Donda
Whatever this may bring us, I’m in full support for it ❤️
hi :)
Thinking it might be a rebrand
Is it sad that this is the only thing I have to look forward to on my b-day? :/
thank you for everything that you have done for us these past few year. i appreciate you so much and wish you the best of luck with whatever you're planning to do
vlog channel incoming????
Comments out here stressing me man 😂 You who I go to to unwind after work. Got much love for you big dawg and will support you no matter what direction you move in after today 🖤💪🏽
Whatever you choose to do in your life, Tyler, your fam supports you!
God this has me worried😂 I’ll support it tho
I hope this is t the end man he’s got me through some really dark times I’m gonna miss him if this is it!
Why has he changed channel Picture to black?
Why is his profile all black
thank you for all the laughs throughout the years i’ve been watching you since third grade and im in the military now and watching your videos keeps me sane and reminds me of home, thank you for everything tyler
I keep seeing comments bout him might retiring but I hope it not
Well fuck, what will I do without my SOLE source of serotonin now? I’m from Iowa what do u expect me to do now?I guess I’ll go pick some corn and cry myself to sleep wishing popi Tyler was still here😭😭
Please be merch or an island vacation vlog series. It'd be so sad if this is Wildcats retirement.
My guess new logo maybe or something big to do with the vlog content
Personally I think he has had enough of gaming and wants to switch from gaming to vlogs
I have a feeling this is about alpha betas that's what I initially thought
I hope wildcat doesn’t leave YouTube, he’s my favorite YouTuber but sometimes good things must come to an end.
Im scared...or nervous...
I literally just saw the announcement and realized it’s in 3 hours :MonkaS:
sheeesh it’s almost time 🫣
I have a feeling it has something to do with the vlog channel
Vlog channel and a new logo.
Rebrand maybe?
I'm guessing either he's retiring or he's announcing him and Kelly are expecting a kid and he's taking a break. I really hope it's not retiring though
His channel is dead. Do y’all really think he was gonna do YouTube forever?  A new channel won’t help him with shit😂😂😂😂😂
If he’s retiring those 5 figure raid shadow legends sponsorships must have paid off😮‍💨
This might be some kind of alpha betas thing
Fadussy moment in 4 hours guys
dats a toilet
He's just becoming a Nascar driver guys. It's fiiiine. Lol. I bet it has something to do with vlogs/cars. That would be siiick
On my birthday too! Happy birthday to me!
Im guessing the Pax vlog
I think it is something good or some positive surprise.  If he were taking a break, I think he would just say it and not put all this time into filming ads for whatever he is doing on this daye.
I think Tyler might be retiring legends come and go
It’s either vlog channel announcement or he joined a gaming org
Hey Tyler! I know you probably won’t read this but no matter what happens, you’ll always be our childhood!
Looking forward to it brother
Please be something about alpha betas
*Clicks notification bell for premier reminder* :D
Shooot vlog time vlog time
Wonder what it’s about
Rebranding?
Wildcat has been hitting at this date for weeks now im so excited and stressed
I feel it might be a new logo, Or he's gonna change his channel
I hope whatever it is I hope it's nothing bad I hope it's good but yeah
New Wildcat Logo?
Seriously what is up with all these bots though?
im pretty sure its his rebrand announcement
Been a fan for a long ass time brother. I don’t remember the exact date but definitely around bo2. I remember your video of your set up for video capturing and shit. I found your channel because of video games. Same as a few other channels. But I no longer play games really. And clearly that content here on YT isn’t doing great on views for most. I think I speak for the majority when I say I’m excited for the future and hopefully it’s vlog heavy with this new channel
I really hope it isn’t the end. I hope just a rebrand. This guy has consistently made ma laugh for a little more than 5 years. When I first came across the canoes crew immediately this pig guy on gta 5 was the one that got to me. I appreciate all the laughs if this is it. Gonna be rewatching a lot of your videos. Hopefully it’s a new alpha betas merch drop lol
He's definitely going to reveal a vlog channel, if you go to his video fortnite moments that prove I'm washed. Around 3:40 pretty sure he says something about him making more content for vlogs
Rebranding???
NINJOI
This has to be a trailer about alpha betas
Man, is wildcat rebranding or something? Every thing on the YouTube page is black. I can’t wait too see, I’ve been watching the vanoss crew for 7 years now and I love all the videos so this has me on the edge of my seat.
Imagine this is his retirement video
Hope he don't quit utube or anything
Imagine it’s the second episode of alpha betas. But jokes aside, if this is his retirement. Then we will miss you bud, you’ve become a staple in YouTube for us. We love you, and hope you have a great future.  Edit: I want to say thank you, for inspiring me, making me feel comfortable being my self. Thank you!
Hurry up already can't take this much pain of waiting
its my birthday cant wait to see what happens
Low key think its a documentary or some type of vid explaining his YouTube journey from start to now
1 pm not am lmfao
Damn my heart is racing I want to know what’s happening but I’m scared at the same time
Oh ffs i messed up
Wassapp I’m hyped for this!!!
I can't wait bro
He is having a kid confirmed, they already picked a name its ghoul twoopa if its a girl and skull twoopa if it is a male
Alpha betas 100%
Cant help but notice 2 people over commenting but ok. Most likely giving youtube the quits or maybe.... hiatus? Plz dont leave!
It sucks thinking you might leave Youtube, I hope whatever its going to be works out for the best!   also thank you for making content I look forward to when I get home from work after a long day of bs. Just knowing I’m going to laugh my ass off later makes everyday easier.   Much love.
**LEAK** Wildcat will be “ retiring from video game content”. He will still post gaming videos every once and a while but it will mainly be vlog videos. Vlogs provide more content room and things to do while video games are getting more and more dry every year. After taking a short break from uploading almost daily for years, the vlogs will start and a new journey with the hog squad will begin. We love you wildcat. Thank you for you amazing videos and amazing content. You deserve this.
Brother if your leaving more power to ya if your staying more power to ya, doesn’t matter what you do I’ll still be here
I hope it is about the vlogs
So I’m thinking it’s a new logo because everything is blacked out!?
I’m completely lost,  can someone inform me
Tyler meets Tyler the creator?
Honestly if it break time we'll deserved if it's a drop even better! Can't wait to see this tomorrow morning 🤗
Either alpha betas first season, or he’s finally cutting his hair.
Vlog Channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m really hoping it’s the second episode of Alpha Betas
I pray he’s not retiring… I’m not ready for my childhood to come to an end.
Wildcat gonna quit YouTube
if this is the end of wildcat its been a hella good run and from elementary school to now its been a true roller coaster thanks for all the laughs man
Can’t wait to find out what all of this means
Honestly if it break time we'll deserved if it's a drop even better! Can't wait to see this tomorrow morning 🤗
Boi
For a decade of Content creating it's time to rest
Yoooo he’s gonna cut his hair  . . . .  finally
Mmmmmm
For a decade of Content creating it's time to rest
I’m really hoping it’s the second episode of Alpha Betas
I'm guessing either Alpha Beta is going to be releasing or Their going to announce that they are having a baby.
My biggest guess is that he's ready to retire from gaming and want to do more vlog videos and focus on the alpha betas season 1
Damn i have never been so stressed until this very moment
As much as I'm concerned for Tyler's wellbeing, I can't help but think that this is a WILDCAT chapter 2 reveal
Either alpha betas first season, or he’s finally cutting his hair.
Honestly I have so much love for Tyler his family and his content, no matter what this is about he has my support 100%
My guess it's alpha beta season drop or a new company idea
Right now both his channel's banner and picture are gone, so either it's getting a update or it's something personal.
he’s gonna be a dad
I pray he’s not retiring… I’m not ready for my childhood to come to an end.
I think he might be retiring
iswm pt2 ft. Wildcat?
Can’t wait to find out what all of this means
Do you think he's maybe done with YouTube ??
First time I've seen Wildcat this serious, sorta. Hope everything's ok
I hope he didnt get hacked (pfp and channel banner are black). Hope its a cool alpha betas thing
You have a good head on your shoulders.
if this is the end of wildcat its been a hella good run and from elementary school to now its been a true roller coaster thanks for all the laughs man
He's doing the Fortnite thing
Damn, Wildcat is serious about this
Proposed to Kelly??
This dude has gotten me through my depression and everything I've seen all his vids Tyler aka wildcat u are my idol no matter how sad or down I am u always put a smile on my face so thank u and I'm gonna support u anyway I can thank u
Honestly if it break time we'll deserved if it's a drop even better! Can't wait to see this tomorrow morning 🤗
Gang

Yaz

WHY DOES HE HAVE A BLACK PROFILE PICTURE WHY IS THERE A BLACK THUMBNAILED STREAM WITH NUMBERS ON IT  This is an avengers level threat

Hopefully it’s not telling us his done being a utuber
i just noticed he changed his whole page. profile picture and the banner to black🤯
Finally he is announcing his only fans account he made for keno feet pics
This is when I have a game
This dude has gotten me through my depression and everything I've seen all his vids Tyler aka wildcat u are my idol no matter how sad or down I am u always put a smile on my face so thank u and I'm gonna support u anyway I can thank u
Honestly I have so much love for Tyler his family and his content, no matter what this is about he has my support 100%
Bravo 6, going dark
Is this branding related?
Anyone else notice that most of the vanoss crew has been putting "WILDCAT" in their titles the past few days?
Maybe he broke pandas ceiling again and fell through this time
For a decade of Content creating it's time to rest
What is happening
This is either a second channel or a podcast
Obviously he’s changing his logo and branding
no fuckin clue whats going on, either rebrand or retire, or i could just be dead wrong
If you retire or rebrand or whatever it is your doing i support you 100%
19 hours is a long wait aye
A new logo?
05.01.22
whatever it is i’m full support:,)
Don't tell me Tyler is deleting is YouTube channel 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😞😞
No doubt its a new logo
My guess is it has to do with his vlog channel and I’m excited for whatever Tyler has in store for us. He’s been apart of my entertainment since 2013
Wildcat is revealing that he's black
Please please be about alpha betas!!!!!
I FULLY support you becoming a vlogging channel🌹❤️
It’s beautiful
Uhh hopefully good news don't wanna hear about him retiring
weldcot
Finally, a Wildcat diss album to Nogla
Damn wildcat really is retiring huh... how depressing. All the best...
its a new logo calling it rn or rebranding of some sort
His banner and profile picture are blacked out. I hope he’s just rebranding
I pray he’s not retiring… I’m not ready for my childhood to come to an end.
First time I've seen Wildcat this serious, sorta. Hope everything's ok Edit: Wow, can't believe I was worried
he is quitting youtube
Maybe taking a break
Goodbye everyone
Walking away from typical wildcat setup + throwing away golden yt plack = rebranding ?
Really hope he’s not retiring
IRL content?
He’s having a baby
All black, What's going on?
Donda 3(just jokes)
Donda
i hope this isn't the end of his challenge 😢
Wildcat busts it back
I kinda hope it's not to do with glitch but we all have our opinions
He is either rebranding, new merch or new channel w different type of videos
Hopefully it's alpha betas
he _is_ nearly at 8 mil subs... so does it have something to do with that by any chance, or is this whole video and sub count line up just a coincidence?
Where is his logo?
All possible theories I could come up with:  Semi-retirement. I don’t mean that he’s quitting. Just he won’t take YouTube as a fulltime serious thing.  Full retirement  New brand/company/business  New series/special series with the channel  Podcast  New channel  Streaming   Huge jabait (which would be kind of funny)
Actually to be honest I’m kind of worried
maybe the time has come… ending his career with 1 word… has it finally come?   edit: i was very wrong
I think he might be doing a new logo
Honestly if it break time we'll deserved if it's a drop even better! Can't wait to see this tomorrow morning 🤗
whatever it is, you have my full support!  Rebranding, retiring and the list of other guesses, then alright
I hope it’s my dad
FaZe Wildcat
I'm guessing new logo, since his channel logo has gone blank
Pls dont retire 😂💔
A surprise on my birthday from my favorite youtuber?! How lucky!
New Glitch flavor: Retirement Raspberry
I hope he ain't leaving 😬
Somethings is kinda wrong... Im scared 💀
Guys I think he’s dropping a new song
Alpha betas or pre retirement for irl content
He is changing his logo
It probably has something to do with modern warfare 2
New vlog channel
Wildcat is making DONDA 2 Comfirmed
I wonder if he’s retiring
Either alpha betas first season, or he’s finally cutting his hair.
oh no
Hope he Ight
Alpha Betasssss
Damn i have never been so stressed until this very moment but whatever it is Wildcat Has my full Support                                                    Im gay

Yo he even changed his icon for this
I’m really hoping it’s the second episode of Alpha Betas

I’m assuming it’s gonna be a rebrand
Either the new channel or rebranding but also wildcast ep14 when??😉
