After the whole Lunchly and his employees exposing him controversy, it's fair to say that he'll never come back to the Item Shop alongside Travis Scott
When is he coming back
I Wrote A BRAND NEW Comment for Day 413 of waiting for the Stuck Emote to return!
How long is Mr beast staying in the item shop
I honestly hate that Fortnite made MrBeast a skin that you have to pay for, as I personally feel, as a long time fan of MrBeast, that it doesn't represent what MrBeast stands for, which is pretty much giving away money for free as long as you complete a few challenges in some of his newer videos, but in others where he provides to the less fortunate. I feel like it would've been better if Fortnite made MrBeast a free Challenge Pack skin, as it would fit much better with MrBeast's personality, and what he does as a content creator.
0:15 HOLY SHIT ITS MR BREAST
Why do they keep doing those same skins the prism things
your voice reminds me of kreekcraft
I feel bad for mr beast, no one would want to be in fortnite
How long will mrbeast stay in the item shop??
Iwant my g travis.. nothing else
I got 1000£ from Mrs Beast utube channel no scam bruh
please open christmas presents with us!
They made beast fat. His face looks fatter
Does som1 know for how much will he be in the item shop?
I’m getting MrBeast 600 for sure
Ngl this looks like chandler and mr beast had a baby.
i used your code 🤓
when mha comes will all the anime skins come back?
bro how much money do you spend on the game
They made him look so tired, and his hairline is weird
i wanted to study inverse tirgnometric functions and your video popped instead lol
Not saying this because it’s Mrbeast but  he might have the best icon series set.
Let’s get ksi next!
The MrBeast6000 is a skin I would actually main lol
Yoo. Im buying vbucks and buying the emote skin looks dope but i dont have thst much vb  for skin. Fortnite putting up bangers
You guys, MrBeast has a creator code, (mrbeast) so be sure to use it if your picking up any of his cosmetics. But if your coping anything else code ITF :)
what is the name of skin that italk using in this video ?
I want mogul masters
How long z he n the store for?
I’m sure Mr beasts would’ve made his skin free or something 💀 epic just a sell out 🤣
Not gonna lie, I was hoping for a better skin transformation for Mr. Beast
Why do you still buy stuff and give epic your money when they literally deleted $10k worth of your cosmetics. That’s pathetic 🤦‍♂️
Dawg when do we get the griddy back
1:34 we need more editing like this in item shop vids
mr beast father is a freemason
"Newer" 💀
Says Jaeger correctly but not viceroy 😂
They made mrbeast look less tired lol
No Mr beast theme 0/10 item shop 😤😤😤
His voice is so squeaky 💀
This guy has a spending problem
Can’t believe mr beast dropped on my birthday 🥳😁
I love this skin but sadly i dont have enough money
Jimmy really deserved this, I’m definitely going to buy! 😊
Hey I talk could I have the mrbeast that has the wolf mask character please that would make my day😁
I think Mrbeasts nose is to big
It is kind of the opposite of what mrbeast does so it would be amazing if it was free 😢
The skin itself is brilliant, it’s just the teeth, they are perfectly straight and white, mr beasts aren’t perfect
to be honest, as darkfire bundle is back for console , i am so excited to finally get that so i’ll pass on mr beast
Mr beast in fortnite is cold af fr
If anyone wanted to know the darkfire bundle Is back!
Mr beast face look likes Chandler's face
Love the freshy kanal cameo audio
Mr beat
Nobody mentioned it but Rick and Morty skins are gone :(
His head so small😭
Hi I like your content the are really cool skins can I play with you on fortnite
I've never ever seen someone with edgefactor
Im so HYPED😎
I saw so many hate comments on Instagram it's so annoying
I knew you were gonna show the MrBeast meme! LMAO
It's December 15th for me so 1 extra day but it's finally here. Let's go
I love your videos ps my id is hasseland
“Nuuirr” how do you manage to miss pronounce noir that bad
Who is better Megadeth or metallica??
Low key Mr Beast not a looker 😭😂
his glider looks sick
Why is his head so small, and his hands are massive?
Wth why does mrbeast look like Mario Lmao 😂😂
All of us using that epic rap battles clip is evidence that we are part of a hivemind
MR BEAAAAAAASSSST
I think his eyes are a bit different from the other icon skins
My user is Elite_F4Z3_L4Z3x
Or can I get the globe shaker skin I actually would prefer the globe shaker skin instead
I think it would be really cool if they added the rest of the main mr.beast crew at some point. Like a chris and chandler bundle would be lit
Its the eyebrows and just facial hair of mr beast, they are way thiccer and bigger then they are in real life. So it feels bit off
His normal skin doesn’t have a backbling, that’s obviously why he’s cheaper.
They need to bring back the candy axe!!!!!
The pricing is pretty simple. 2 bundles. One is a tad cheaper. Separates the 2.👍🏻
I honestly wish we had a boxer release maybe a Canelo Alvarez, a mike Tyson, a muhammad Ali, any of the modern day or industrial day boxers would be amazing kinda sad they’ve added football, soccer, etc but not boxers.
Loved the part where MR BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAST gets an icon skin, lmao.
bro said 6450 vbucks is kinda low now.......
😮
Honestly the beast6000 is dope, but beast is not a guy I am a fan of.
You Can Play As Me In Fortnite!
I honestly dont like beast. But I honestly want to buy the beast6000 skin because it does slap
Anyone know why they removed the Christmas fishstick and candy axe from ‘tis the season shop?
Not noir 😭
What skin do you have on?
U sound like formula 0:34
MRBEEAAAAST!
Hey I Talk, do you think Travis Scott will come back?
When will travis scott return to the item shop ?
He looks like he has an extra chromosome
The reason the main skin cost 1200 is cause it has no backbling but it is still a great skin
Let’s all be honest he should of had a skin years ago when he started doing stuff with tfu and ninja even if they were only a couple vids
The highlight of this video is that the Rick and Morty set it’s finally gone 😂💯🤘🏽
the Bootleg mr.Beast keeps crackling me up especially at the ending hahahaa 😂 genius what you are
I don’t mean this in a rude way but noir is pronounced no are I’m sorry if I sound rude just trying to help
The collab we never expected
Thanks for showing off the new beast skins and hope you are doing well I Talk.
Sorry, but the skin is a hard pass for me
Love the descriptions of all the cosmetics,picked up the 6000 bundle
HOLY FRIIIIICK!!!!
Day 711 of MR BEAAAASSTTTT  and not the Black Widow Outfit.
FINALLY the Rick and Morty skins are GONE
Guys his name is italk69
Mr. Beast is finally in a dead game let's goooooo this is something I always wanted 😂
They fucked my man’s face up
Dang they took out the best Christmas stuff Rick and Morty f's in the chat F
You have to say MRBEAAAAAAST! Or it just doesn't work.
Three years playin FN and I'm pretty sure that I've never met anybody runnin any edge factor skin.
You forgot about the 2 pack
Bruh I’ve been subbed for so long I still use ur code to this day
Hm 2x different style of MrBeast. First is amazing and second one looks like new Midas. So i can say it is like 9/10
Rick and Morty is finally gone!!!!
bro owns the iteam shop damnn
OPEN YOUR PRESENTS
Crazy mr beast is 1200 but ig it’s because he told epic he want everyone to afford the skin
Also the bassassin quest pack and darkfire bundle pack are back in the shop as well
MR BEEEEEEEEAAAST
I believe mr beast wanted his set to not be too expensive cause he’s known for giving away stuff and wants more people to get it
Looks sick but I see what you mean about mr beast face. But the skins still look good. But I feel like it would have been 🔥 if the mr beast skin had a very reactive pink and purple flames or something like that in a wolf skin. Like sypherpk in a way. And his song on a emote.
For anyone wondering where that Mr beast clip is from look up "Mr beast vs squid game"
You know what they should add is the Grinch to fortnite
“This is cheap” Hey! Speak for yourself 😭 not everyone can make a lot😂
I want to buy one of the 2 detective skins but im torn between both, opinies?
No way bro said why is it so cheap 12$ for a virtual skin is outrageous
Man ngl I would love a mr.beast 6000 music pack
The character model’s eyes make him look stoned
Ever since chapter 2 season 5 I’ve been subscribed
Just two more days until MHA.
You've like never read the description to any item.
Bro who the heck is Mr beast I googled it but nothing came out.
The pricing isnt inconsistent the FFC skins that didn’t have backblings were icon skins that only costed 1200
My wallet is gonna be hurting 😭
the reason mr beast is only 1200 is because he has no backbling
Why does he look like the epic rap battles version of him💀
bro looks like MrYeast 💀
bruh I alr predicted mr. beast would come to fortnite 😅
I'll wait until MHA Skins releases, hopefully he still be there tomorrow or other day.
Fun fact: Waffles are just crunchier pancakes with abs
He had 6450 Vbucks and said his Vbucks were low😂
THEY GOT RID OF RICK AND MORTY!
Imagine everyone got it for free
MR. BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MR BEAST!!!
mrbeast6000 reminds me of kondor
Welcome to the video game where mrbeast can one pump goku while John cena bush camps
The cosmetics are cool, but I think it was a bad time for him to come. I think we should have gotten more Christmas skins instead. The only ones we are getting is winter skye, and the free ones. Every one says we didn’t get anything for Halloween but we got more than 3 skins.
Just wanted to say I don't always wanna get on fortnite to see the shop so this helps a lot plus I agree with the master of puppets coming to fortnite
It would be cool if they added a Mr beast poi
Bro MrBeast don’t even play Fortnite but typical gamer And he still don’t get a skin typical game is better than MrBeast at Fortnite
No swaged out for MrBeast????
new R skin
Only thing that is good in Mr beast bundle is the weapon wrap. Everything else is really not that great.
I don't like his Face too  It don't look good. Jimmy is a good looking guy....
I think the reason that human one looks weird is becuase they overdid his cheeks
Wish they’d unvault Hugo
Oh I think I know what it is. His face is suppose to resemble his thumbnails, how they look uncanny and such
I wish they could have put the mrbeast theme song in the emote
That ending 😂
Finally, the antichrist in fortnite
bro the phone in the backround!!💀
5:12 goofy ahh android notification sound 💀😂😂😂
MrBeast is 1200 because he doesnt have a back bling, 1500 for that would be stupid imo
Literally like everyone doesn’t care about your opinions on skins. Just show the item shop
I love how the descriptions look like mrbeast a video titles he probably added that himself
Yet Nick eh 30 still doesn’t get shit or anything, privileged mf mrbeast is, why is this deserved for him
That's amazing I'm such a big fan of Mr. Breast I'm definitely copping 💯
The set looks sick
This dude cannot pronounced “Noir” for his life… 🤦‍♂️
Epic is a sell out advertising company now. Trash
Ngl I'm not a huge fan of the actual MrBeast skin, but the cell-shaded MrBeast6000? 😳 the skin is low-key AMAZING! I love the tech wear aesthetic too. Also glad to see the detective skins back, sleuth is an all-time classic skin and I genuinely hope I can get it now that it's back. Overall great shop!
guys you should buy this skin  because it might also become rare like the travis scot skin
living vicariously through you spending 10k+ vbucks in a 4 minute span
"Why is it so cheap" He must not know who mr beast is
no way... it's MR. BEAST
RICK AND MORTY IS FINALLY GONE!
New
I’m buying one: should I buy the anime version or original?
MR. BEAAA-
It's about damn time Rick and Morty left the item shop
His eyes are different sizes
MRR. BEEAAAAST❗❗❗
MRBEAST6000 YEAH YOU KNOW HIS NAME
Alrighty. Cool. Now bring on Izuku and Co! Here's hoping we get Izuku, Katsuki, Ochacko and Shouto (I want Shouto instead of All Might. Not that I have anything against All Might, I just don't want to buy a super bulky skin.). I can't wait!
Now all we need is Mr Squid Game
Looks more like Chandler
Did I miss why he doesn't list last seen in the item shop anymore? I miss that, bring it back please
i wanna cop that soo bad
Mr beeaaast 6000 oooohhhhh
The MrBeast skin looks fantastic, the face looks exactly like him I'm not going to lie
Rick and Morty are gone!!
Does anyone know how long he will be out, the quests say that they will end on jan 4th 2023
HALLELUJAH RICK AND MORTY IS GONE FINALLLYY. How many days were they here including when they were around for Halloween?
Thats good he don't need to b so high italk n nice item shop today
I like the cell shaded one better tbh.
I'm not a fan of him he gives me a uneasy feeling if you understand
Wish they had an emote that has his theme song
MR BEAAAAAAAAAAST
Pls let mr beast stay till Christmas!
Mrfeastables taste horrible. (Just the cookies taste like dog)
Bought both Mr beast bundles. Most favorite YouTuber of all time
great videos always waiting for this
The notification sound on his phone is absolutely amazing 😂
Winter lodge
Open ur presents
The Mr Beast bundles are sick
Man when fortnite was coming back with good stuff like the Metallica emote. Then they take a jump off the mountain with me beast smh 🤦‍♂️ the fall has begun. Glad I stopped playing. They ain’t getting no more money from me.
You butchered the word “noir” so badly 😂
So you calling MR beast ugly
snowdancer shouldve been released isntead of ugly ass mr beast
they brought back the detectives!!!!!!
4:12 nueir skin
gg rick & morty
The best part of the item shop is that Rick and Morty is gone!
That is not mrbeast that’s mrbroke
I lov; mr bread :)
MRBEAST LETS GOOOO
Go open the presents
Rick and morty finally out the item shop
Let's Gooo🙌 I'm a Big fan of what Mr. Beast does for community and the people all over the world❤️I'm definitely copping this joint🔥🥵
imo im not a fan of the mrbeast bundle but i do kinda like the mrbeast6000 bundle
Mrrrrr BEAAAAST
Going to be great couple days for the item shop
A music pack would be nice
He made his skin only 1200 just to show that he doesn’t even need the money 🤯
Surpise one one complain why they separate MR. Beast styles. Shouldnt it come together
MR BEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAST
Mr. Beast PLZ COMMENT ON THIS VIDEO
No christmas skin for amine big sad.
If I have 3500  vbucks and I buy Mr.Beast  by himself and still be able to buy my hero academia?
Imagine getting danced on by Mr beast
Mr bust
MR BEAST SIX THOUSAND oh oh oh
You know, really thought he would be a Winterfest reward. It would fit with his whole charity identity. PAYING for Mr Beast is a little…out of character.
Finally we witnessed a unusual thing Rick and morty is gone
why you change your in game name and channel to italk69
I’m literally 300 vbux from the bundle 😭
"Mrbeast6000 oh whoa. Mrbeast6000 oh whoa, Mrbeast6000 yeah you know his name. He changes once or twice but I think he's here to stay."
Lol I love the fact that each of his descriptions on his cosmetics are able to be used as video titles😂 go fortnite X Mr. beast!!!!!
The 6000 one looks better because it looks less like Mr Beast, imo, the eyes aren't perfect on the original and I think the cartoon or anime style works better. Definitely picking up the second version.
lower graphics
Flop shop
LMAO why did they make his nose so big😂
Love yr content
can iget pinned
The 6000 version kinda looks like HappyPower 🤔
Imagine if your using the emote it plays Mr beast’s outro theme song.
2022 is crazy
He feels off because his mustache looks decent
bro i started dying at the mr beat 💀💀💀
Omg
What a horrible shop man horrible new skin dude are you serious. 😐
what!
Man now I can hit the griddy as mr beast 😂
837th
Can't believe im the 2nd view with over 460 likes
Italk makes these banger of the vids every night and I love him for it
Congrats to Mr.Beast for getting his skin in game, however I feel like this is more of a net positive for Fortnite, I think he likes looks a little strange since his skin isn’t shaded good.
Beast beast beast
Mr beast 6000 AHHHHHHHHHOHHHH
MR BEASTTTTT 🖐🤯
People said he would be free 🤣🤣🤣

Aint no way
Bro took longer to add that edit in💀
Hi
And  the new "make it rain" emote
I kind of like how each description of his cosmetics looks like a video title. Very clever on their part!
He’s got that ‘You know I had to do it to em’ pose
first
I hope he stays till Christmas. I really want him but I can't any vbucks till then
MISTAH BEASTTT
Hi

Hi man
Lol just saw it
MRBEAST
Glad the detective skins are back. I’m actually quite a fan of them.
