Do something difficult enough times, you're bond to get a favorable result. But then, can you do it again, and this time faster, better, more consistently than before?
Each of those boats has about 300$ of JUST BATTERIES

traxxas must love yall lol
Nice video 😂
Waww
HAHAHAnono
fans have to be really bored in life to watch this stuff
this is how you properly do an ad
At 1:02 I think someone  sayed the F word
dem RC boats powerful
Lol.
Yo
All they do is screaming “Lesgoo” after thousands of try
Nice❤
anyone else notice that's wakesurfing?
Ditto on that
amazing
is this the lord of the rings like the rings  of fire in the movie bro that was raddd
All these are not impossible at all 😂 just need money so In that sense ig 💀💀
3:00 This is Rocket League!
3:14 emmm, Rocket Leage
Cool. I like it🤩
Gonna be honest I love the content but the cringe music really takes away from my enjoyment
😳😳😳
RC Header looks a lot like a Rocket League aerial xD
Love the rc videos
Wow!
What was your favorite trick shot with the arc cars
Tt you are the best  you are my favorite then the gang
Ya are the best people
They searched high and low, but they did it! They managed to find the worst music possible
3:11 Rocket League?
You all must do a lot of ripper magooooos 😆 🤣 😂
Remember the katolina wine mixer guys , these guys are like real life versions of those douches 🤣😂 , I bet they say things like “ yo bro “
Bro hit an aerial
Dude
you guys are awesome
Your newer content feels more comercial. There is a lack of human connection.
rc stuff would be quite hard to fake
I think it sort of misses the point to wake-board behind RC boats if the person wake-boarding is not DRIVING said RC boats.  Just seems like a missed opportunity.
Cory giving credit to team work is what make this guys awesome. Love the music.
Your Fortnite shoutout is so cringe
U guyss nailed it 😻🔥
Nice
Never stop making me amazed and laughing out loud. Love you guys.
for the triple stack one, was it located in sugarland?
the stuff they do is kool af. but the guys are hard to watch.
HOW THIS IS FIRE 🔥  and I have a rc truck that can go on water 💦
You know that your special when epic games themselves sponsors your video
That’s amazing
Where did you get the RC cars?
How does the to car just flip forward in the air in the first trick shot?
I don't think people realize how expensive this is. I mean like even the smallest jump attempts are a grand each 😄
I love what you do you for the video
Hh
Traxxas spartan for sale barely used
That was very nice
This is rocket league
Get the Arrma Kraton 8s
its like hot wheels taken to another level

Just wanted to say that I appreciate that you changed the thumbnail. Don't start photoshoping thumbnails because it's a bad move and will decrease people's trust in you. I still love you guys but I just hope that you got the message and avoid this kind of situations in the future. Ly
Pretty cool I like ur vid
Еоыоаойово3уое
the rc header was equal to rocket league :)
I didn’t know you play Fortnite
Nice
You guys are the best youtubers
it so funny seeing them use a crystal radio to control all the boats rather then a complicated set up for modern remotes, i even have the same exact remote.
Nice
Hii

You should modify the RC and put some wings on it. Other cool idea is to make a drone race... just saying
Love you 😍 love
What do you mean that's 1st try. You messed it up Like 4 times.
Dude Perfect sponsored my fortnite while failing a trick shot feels illegal to watch
Love rccars
No one noticed on the hydro ring of fire the car drove on the water
The sledge never breakes
I wish it was the supra mk4
Woooooooooohoh
Wow

Comment
The RC header kinda reminds me of rocket league
Real Life Rocket League👍🏼👏🏽
Their wife’s, “ how come they can’t have this fun with us 🤣😭🤣”.          Women will never stop being jealous the fact that a guy can be happy with his buddies; whether it be RC cars or football or just grabbin some beers somewhere”
Lol… you can wakeboard behind 1 RC boat It just needs to be big enough
so cool😎😎😎😎😎

If anything they should’ve been sponsored by rocket league

Yo
@dudeperfect in OT 28 you were talking about how the integrity of both betcha and cool not cool we’re being compromised but top ten has as well it has become a show where all you do is make fun of a person’s opinion it’s ok to disagree but they are blatantly peer pressuring people into change their lists to something they don’t agree with
They cut off Cody's unbelievable!!
FIREEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:45 that rainbow was so cool !
hey dude perfect. this is stop brotion studios. please shout out our channel in one of your videos! we  are subscribers and huge fans!

I have an idea and only you guys can do it right, play the real life Mario kart switch game with as many players with physical karts as possible on a true map made by dude perfect, i think you guys would come up with the best map.
I would like to see you guys open baseball cards packs
Awesome

I love how they said first try but it was like the 5 or 4 try
The first one is reversed I think

Dang, that's pretty awesome. Love RC
In the half pipe ringer it’s two different shots for slow mo an the not slow mo
🚀🌝
The content is very great 😍😍😋😋
Fun to see the testing process for the RC boat wakeboarding. Trial and error!
That was awsome
Coby's boat thingy is the coolest thing I've seen this week I legit got chills when it worked
They are amazing
wow you guys are the best at trick shot with everything
He through a whip on that roof jump
DP makes some bangers. They put an immense amount of effort and practice to nail some of their stunts and trick shots.   That being said, this vid is probably their lamest I’ve seen in a while. Yeah there’s a margin for error on any trick shot, but driving an RC car on a pre built ramp through a massive ring of fire is just not impressive or entertaining. I really hope there’s a certain audience out there that enjoyed this, though. Just wasn’t for me.
I dare you TY to shave your beard the whole beard.
Not that it makes a big difference, but that wasn't a wakeboard.
Nice
this was Ryans clinking beards idea
sub to LG1 and Ryan Clinkingbeard

How many rc trucks/cars were harmed in this video?
great vid
*wake surfing, wakeboarding you are strapped in
The trick shots are insane
Luka 77 ,!!!
The video is sick
Amazing!!
Hi
You should do a video with Usain bolt!
So I’m an engineering major at Clemson University and I think I could help make a rig to get the RC boats to pull you out the water and keep going may need to replace/ upgrade motors tho
Hey was that water park Hawaiian falls? I went there forever ago and that was the most fun I've had at a water park
The cars drive on water
Calling Cody a baffoon cracks me up so much
Now I want a horse made out of bacon.
Wow! You guys put so much time and effort into these! We appreciate it! I always wonder how long each of these shots really takes and how labor-intensive it is. That RC wakeboarding deserves a million likes! Awesome as always! These guys exudes such positive energy that they tend to lift everyone's spirits ❤️ My Fav Verse Romans 8:28
Hey yo imagine this legends when they go old
I love fortnigh
The best in 2022 rc cars
Awesome!!!
Awesome video, the RC boats wakeboarding great idea!
loser
Why do they keep on changing the title of the videp
These props must have taken a lot of time to build. No doubt about the skill now
Do a stereo type in the next video

I'd like to see a meatcanyon video on these guys.
We need more panda in these vids😭
💡 IDEA you dudes should have a golden buzzer in cool not cool for the person to win 200 bucks
They don’t do much soccer now that I think of it.
You always do a clean job 👏 🙌 👌
I was expecting something like _Rocket League_ to sponsor this one. Missed opportunity! 😆
Fish
Who thinks that next bucket list is Grand Canyon
Maybe you might want to pick a different name for this video, waterboarded and waterboarding, sure they sound the same, buuut waterboarding is a form of torture the CIA used to get information out of you
Comment
Sweet
Can’t wait
Honestly this was really different and not what I was expecting from DP. It’s cool, but not the usual format of skills involved. Kinda disappointed and lacking in any skills whatsoever. I wish they would return to the old format of trickshots.  Edit** WHY THE **** IS THE COMMENT SECTION FILLED WITH FAKE COMMENTS FROM OBVIOUSLY FAKE CHANNELS??!!! "Great content!" "You guys never cease to amaze me!" ... -.- Thats wack man..
⠀
Muito bom
Yooooooooooo
I love dude perfrect
15  Spartans with batteries cost more than a real boat 🤡
was ty  crying
SO COOL! Congratulations Coby!!!😁😁😁😁 Purple hoser fan!!!😜😜
🔥👽🚀🔥
Hi
And how exactly did you get the RC to rotate forwards at the top of the jump on to the light pole? It's 4WD so you can't have used the throttle to rotate it, and even if it were RWD, the amount of rotation and horizontal movement was completely unnatural considering it was going perfectly vertical before it magically lept on to the light pole.  Fake or rigged.
1:02 🙊🙈
Hi, I've been following you since 2015 when you broke glass bottles full of powder paint. I wanted to tell you if they gave me a gamer pc I'm from Argentina and I can't buy one for the economy of the moment that's why I ask you I love you

Hey dude perfect, my name is Landyn Beltran and I am 6 years old. I am one of your biggest fans. I didn’t know you liked rockets. My Papa showed me a picture with his son, Allen Isdell and you at a rocket shoot. I thought that was so cool. I hope you made a video of it to share with your fans. One day I hope to meet you !

Hello! My name is Lila and I am going into fifth grade. You guys are AWESOME and I have 2 requests for videos. One of the videos I would like you to make is a school stereotypes video. The other video I would like you to make is a school trick shot video.  I really love the Overtimes. Wheel Unfortunate is my favorite segment and I loved when you did an opposite Overtime video with Wheel Fortunate instead of Wheel Unfortunate. I have watched almost all your videos (from the first to the last) and I am working on watching them all! THANK YOU SO MUCH for all you have done! You are the best!
I love ur vids DP
That’s wake surfing not wake boarding😂
The first one I can’t even comprehend the math !

Hi

That’s really and correct me if I’m wrong but arnt you normally attached to the board when your wake boarding so isn’t that just skim boarding with a boat
if wanted to do one of your tricks i can do the ring of fire one but all my rc cars are broken i need to buy more but I can't there hard to find

That's wakesurfing, not boarding, may be easier if you use a board with wakeboarding boots
the back flip bullseye was the most satisfying
Now do it with rc cars
I wanna know how many RC cars they went through
Respect to all the trickshots 🔥

Technically a wakeboard has something that hold your feet to the board, so that was more of a wakeskate or wakesurf but pretty awesome nonetheless.

DP is straight 🔥🔥
When I heard ring of fire my mind went strait to Johnny cash
Rohit shetty fan club
I think i’ll stick to my bike
RC stunts is what every kid dreams of and you just did some sick stunts!! And well, loved the whole process of the RC wakeboarding with the build, the fails and at last the final victory!! 👏👏 Dude perfect never disappoints 😄✌️
Very entertaining video! :) But me, as an RC-guy, do not think that many of these rc stunts are as hard or amazing as many of your older non-RC stuff you have done. It is very entertaining and nicely done, but it feels like many of the stunts,  i could have performed them myself. Which was not the case with many of your older videos, which probably took like 100 tries to get it right. 😜  I like your RC-videos a lot, but i think that you amazing guys can increase the difficulty level one step on the RC-stunts 😉

Hello guy’s
Fortnight needs to stop
thats surfing this is a scam
I was the first trick shot on instagram like 3 days ago I think it was because when I went on instagram first one I saw
This is what the RC car was saying when they were about to drive it from one building to other "please no please!"
I love these guys but its not them controlling the rc cars lol
Wow that was amazing! Love this video, one of the best i've seen of yours. 8 minutes is too short!! I would like to see a episode like mythbusters on this video, see all the setbacks, calclulations, how you built the rigs, how you got permissions and so on. Anyway, great work dudes!!!
This  video is awesome! Another amazing video.💛😃
Changed the title of the video? First it was about the RC Boats on the lake, and now it says "Impossible RC Stunts." That is very interesting
Nice jump

Can you please make another overtime. I love your videos but I’d love a new one.🙏
I love dude perfect
2:45  rainbow
1:05 now I know how my homie Sonic feels
This is the LAST Video I will every Watch of Dude Perfect!!!   I have watch DP for years, but promoting a first person shouting video game after all this country has been through is unacceptable.!!!   Absolutely reckless!!!  No one should support DP for this sponsorship.
I don’t think that’s wakeboarding
Cory is a bad  driver
RC Header is IRL ROCKET LEAGUE
Can you do another airsoft battle
Fortnite ad lol awesome
Why no BTS videos are uploaded to the DP Plus channel? This video will have  amazing BTS footage.
Crazy to see how far we have come, I remember the frisbee videos with the pro player 💪🤷‍♂️
Fun to see the testing process for the RC boat wakeboarding. Trial and error!
Muminfraughlazar Cough Cough...
Anyone know what RC car they are using?
2:49  Who saw the rainbow
Can we all agree that Tyler is the best and Cory stinks
3:10 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!!
Wow I'm inpressed!  (≧∇≦)/
love the ENERGY!!!!
Who else thinks they are ten times better YouTubers than mr.beast
3:07 rocket league in real life
Love the onboard
you should do a RC P-51 Mustang Stunts with other planes of your liking that would be awesome
First try?…
I like this VIDEO!!!!!!!!! YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!   :)
Awesome video buddies 🤟👈👉
we love u dude perfect
Hi
so busssssin
3:04 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!!!
These guys are insane
Well done guys y’all out done y’all’s self 👏👏👏
I have seen some vids with Mrbeast mentioning y’all and y’all mentioning him, just curious when we are going to get a collab?
These guys are better than mr beast
Who else loves that they always make trick shots work
1:48 bro did a 180 smoothly 😂 imagine actual half pipe tricks with these things
science
This was sick but how did the car go over the water
The RC Header is like rocket league in real life lol
These guys live out all my childhood dreams 😂
we have Havana syndrome in Vilnius
Zero builds came out over 2 months ago🤣
I just feel like all the trick shots are getting boring
Hey, I know you will never see this. But what would make the wakeboard challenge much easier would be if you used a wake board. In this video y’all used a wake surf board. Wakeboards are much easier to stay us and keep balance. Coming from experience I personally wakeboard and wake surf. If y’all see this I love y’all and please take the advise
I am just glad this channel is fading out
Great video, we love your style!! Nice job!
CRINGE
I want 1 to buy its to expensive
A
No outro :((
i love your vids sub
Best
This has been insane beat YouTubers ever

l
They did a wonderful job! Another video well done!
Great tricks.  Been a longtime fan.  Can I say, however, I like the old ones better when they didn't have so many requests to subscribe or buy a sponsored product.
Wow even after all these years y'all somehow managed to turn it up another notch. Driving across an entire body of water. Just wow!
😲😲😲😯😯
Love your videos
Cool
Guys I just met Ty June 7 2022
This guy excudes such a positive energy that lifts everyone spirits😍😍

Just curious when I’ll see y’all or panda in the item shop on fortnite tho👀👀👀

👏👏👏👏
But then asks the question, can we sleepboard behind rc vehicles.

I plqy zero builds
This amazing RC boat stunt could be on the world record
very nice video
:)

I really hope they still remembered the tt chant from overtime 13
E
Nice work! great video👌
😎🙏
🤣

Rc race on a race track

At 8:44 I saw rainbow 🌈 at the back of rc car
3:14 is irl Rocket League
2:43  That Rainbow tho
At exactly here 2:45 you can see rainbow behind the  splashing water of the car.
2022: wakeboarding behind mini boats  2042: launching a basketball into the stratosphere
Super cool
It deserves more views and likes
Dude perfect can we plz see a ping pong trick shots 6 (like if you want to see it too)
I expected more with the intro of 10 impossible rc stunts. Only 2 I really enjoyed
3:06 "This is the RC header" more like "THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!"
Can you give us the name of the rc pls
That’s not wakeboarding, wakeboarding is the board with the boots on it. That’s just a wakesurf board
WE WANT DP IN FORTNITE!!!!
This vid has the vibe. Just pure fun
Bruh
Y’all were sponsored by fornite
That rc pulled a Jesus
Nice
Question- how rc cars did you break while making this video?
🔥
My birthday is on July 16 which is the day of your guys tour
Thats wake surfing thoe not wake boarding.
Fornite Friday
Bro
The wakeboarding from Coby is a win for me. Team Coby forever!
Shoulda had Roman Atwood as a guest for this one
hey where do you get these rc cars?
nice
It’s never clickbait
cool
so cool
Where does Cody get his sunglasses? Those are rad!
Love all the rc videos they do
I love Fortnite
Love your work please say hi Hailey in your next video please.
I love RC Stuff
We need train stereotypes! Like so dp sees
Awesome SkiBrendella.  Don’t see those everyday.
wow
👏👏👏👏👏👏
hi i love your vidios and i love your chanal
This video made my day! Keep up the amazing work!!!!
Cool
Welcome back rc's toys
Dude perfect is the best YouTube channel there is!!!
Let’s Goooooo!!!!!
8min of "let's do this" and guys yelling "Let's GO"
He is actually wake surfing nit wakeboard wakeboarding is when your feet are strapped to the board and wakesurf is with a surf board with no straps so they are wrong he did not wakeboard behind rc boat
Dude perfect is literally perfect
the feeling of accomplishment when the boats took off  so amazing!
I really wonder who comes up with all these crazy and super entertaining video ideas...
7:33 He didnt wakeboard  What he did is called wakesurf Look it up both of them are way different
2:17 is that a doll or a person?
We neeed Ot 34
I like the build up for the RC wakeboarding the roof jump. Great work guys
those rc cars must be brocken 50000 times
Great video, well done. One question, will you still be doing Overtime?
U guys should have used a real Supra
I’m convinced GoPro and RC are the best combination for entertainment content
Woooow
where we going?
Nice
No build fortnite has been a thing for months
Great job 👍
nice job
Did you guys just wakeboard a wakesurfing board
D
Any explanation for why the old AM radio for the boats?
I am going to be the happiest girl for over time
rocket league IRL???
How did you get rc cars to drive on water?
How did you get the rc cars to drive in water🤔
Ayy

1:02 the profanity I thought I heard…  *phew* 😬
Awesome!
WAW
Anybody else thought their AirPods died at 4:23😂
That’s not a wakeboard tho
Yay
💗 Love  💗❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗

You guys should do like an rc rocket league battle!
That was incredible!!!!
I love you guys
E
Them using a surfboard after saying they are going to wakeboard
45 mins long not falling on big waves
U should’ve brought me out for wakeboarding I’m amazing at it

Anyone else thinking the whole time that they are wake surfing not wakeboarding😂
Like if the guys need to do another airsoft video
I need a rc note
3:10 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE
Dudes, you got your minds on some crazy stuff. I love it!
How many cars did you break doing the first stunt?
We need RC rocket league
hi
For one of your bucket lists you should go to Costa Rica! 🇨🇷
comment
When ur a bit older, the fake enthusiasm and that u cant unsee the "youtube blueprint" that they are following, like being loud high energy etc.. it just gets annoying tbh, love the content tho. but yeah XD i get why its done, and it works obviosly.. just hard not to think about only that when watching
I can only say unbelievable
love it
To the editor: Excellent job of back synching the "let''s do this!" with the flip. I think one of my sayings about audio/video I've learned over the years applies here: The key to editing isn't knowing which button to push, it's knowing when to push it. 3:11 Messi-like.
Didn’t know fortnite would have to sponsor dp haha
Hey can you guys mabey gift me 1000 vbucks? Deerhunter0608pr. I really want the battle pass is the thing
Did you gyes retire from tricks shots
Commentinggg....
I feel like these dudes would literally yell at anything, dude ties his shoe lace, FIRST TRY!!!! YEAH!! BABY!!!!!!!
W O W😱 Amazing work👍👍👍
we need more overtime what happend
Sería genial que hicieran un vídeo de trick shots evitando trick shots.....
i like this vidoe
Our of all supras why did they use the new ones they should’ve used the Toyota supra mk4
That’s a surf board.
where are the OT 😢
Coby you absolute legend
Anybody else notice that he’s surfing not wakeboarding?? False advertisement 😂😂
Idea for future video: Video-gamer stereotypes
Hi
5:08 Such a dad laugh lol
One word. WOW!
the second one at the end it said f it
Thx
Fortnight sucks now it used to be awesome
when did real life add rocket league
Rocket league would have been a better target and epic could still be the sponsor
nice vid
1:12
Amazing.
That's not wakeboarding, it's wake surfing, just without a wake. Wakeboards have bindings.
Dude perfect i waching 700k subscribe i love you broo
weeee
Can u all open basketball cards I think that would be cool
that fire jump was wicked
Love the rc video!
Dude made an Ariel goal💀💀

One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—- 🟥

Great compliments to all. This is another amazing episode with off the charts challenges 🤩👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻🥇

This was sponsored by fortnite and not Rocket league…..
Hello, they should make a channel in Spanish 👌
Dude perfect is a channel that I will just never get tired of
Should do a pickle ball stereotypes
Best video ever this really deserves a like
Weh
the word you are looking for is wake surf. thats not even a wake skate. awesome content , bad clickbait....keep on
I’m commenting to help bring you’re popularity back because I’ve sachet you guys since I was a kid
What happens to dp plus tho?
From the first Traxxas video from you guys I’ve been wanting one, and till now, it still seems impossible
Why do you waste the RC cars 😭
Shoulda had a mrk4 supra and more drifting but still a sick vid
3:10 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE

Hello
The edits are always so clean
I think their running out of ideas.
For all the RC cars they use, there all the world fastest.
Remember when these guys played fortnite with Ninja. Now they’re advertising fortnite
No OT No Party !!!
Where is overtime 34
YES FORTNITE
🤣
Cool!!
7:30 wakeboarding behind arc boats
this is absolutely insane
It's sponsored by epic yet they chose Fortnite to advertise? Rocket league would fit here waaay better and it's epic's game as well!
brilliant absolutely brilliant
Not one of the best videos like u guys do. Take time and upload the phenomenal video ❤️❤️
4:19 4:21 the sound made me think my AirPods died anyone else?
That was an awesome video y’all. Y’all are the best
YAY GUYS fortnite ZERO BUILDS is super fun. test your tactics or your building skill in NORMAL BR modes. its fun

Wow! You guys put so much time and effort into these! We appreciate it!
Dudes are always perfect
Subscribe if you haven’t already!👍🏻
Awesome like always!
It is always so much fun watching what you do.
The best trick shot of the video was the dude with the rope at 7:41
You should pull a cboys an hydroplane with a snowmobile

Awesome video
Hi
I’ve been waiting on  Ping pong trick shots 6!
Amazing. Absolutely amazing
💯💯💯💯💯
Who was driving that supra holy cow
Fun fact: this was a trick shot video for the most party
These guys never disappoint. Great video!!!
at 2:46 there is a slight rainbow behind the RC car which just made this stunt even better.
Crazy
The emotion at the end of this, that was real impressive with the rc boats but also how many trucks did you total??
7:27
what kind of rc cars do you use
as someone not impressed with editing this channel only has views because of editing lol SAD AF.
Hey there you know just missing basketball
is overtime discontinued or something?
I sub too you let gooooooo
that hydroplane looks physically impossible how did that just happen
WOW nice
It’s been two years i am watching dude perfect, but i never felt boring watching any of these videos. Hats off to you guys.
Nyimak bos ku..
Can I have one of the boats?
Epic video 👍🏼
6:41 what was the trick here
OP OP
That's wakeskating, not wakeboarding but still really cool. Try barefooting next time......
Nyimak sahabat .
plz do rollerskates trick shots
How many RC Cars were sacrificed for this video ?
Guess they forgot to film an outro
when will you post the next overtime and nice job guys.
The most impressive part is he did on a surf board
Sadly Epic games banned me for no reason.
The tire marks on some of them just represents how long they take for these
.
Boom. 👍🏻
Just a commercial for Traxxas.
Can't wait for bucket list
Cory’s laugh at 5:10 😂😂😂
T
何が凄いのかわからない… おもちゃだし壊れても平気。何度もやれば一回はできるでしょう。 テンションを上げて大げさに見せてるだけに見える。
Bro  Watching for 5 years now Never not seen you guys make a banger
The toyota supra scene is soo confusing. Great job though !!!
2:29 physics would like to disagree
Let’s go
1:05 POV: your sonic the hedgehog
I’m pretty sure Coby turned into the next Australian Santa riding on a wake board with 10 rc boats
the rc header is straight up rocket league
Can you make a montage of the trick shots you made first try and show your longest trick shot at the end
That was great.
L Sponser
That was awesome! Once you got the RC racing boats going, it was terrific! 😃🥰❤️
What happened to overtime
Dp definitely got 100 in physic when they were in school
Long time to edit this
great videos as always
Bro, thats an epic song right there!
Like how the replay of the half pipe ringer is a completely different run than the original 😂
Amazing video! BTW it's wakesurfing technically and not wakeboarding 😉
Great vid
Your content after all these years never ceases to amaze me, well done and keep it up brothers!!
I’m now waiting for flying with rc helicopters
Hahahajghbcrfrrfoesmkkplnsqq
Can’t wait for overtime 34!! 👊
2 all nighters for that clip... that loop better be used for a different video.... I thought it was going to be a regular basket ball hoop.... what a bad clip XD
Love the vids! But that is actually a surfboard for behind a boat so I think itsnwakesurfing and not wakeboarding
Great vid! And show of skill fro the boys.
Amazing Video 🔥🔥 🤩 wow
by far MY FAVORITE DUDE PERFECT VIDEO
suprised they didnt advertise the event
Way to go Coby!!!!!! Best RC stunt ever!!!!
Is that a Supra?
Incrediblle content. Respect ❤

Love the vid!!!

The way that I wasn’t invited to this and I work at Hawaiian falls 🥲
graet shotes

Always love RCs but, let’s get some Nitro in there 🔥💪🏻
Laugh at 5:10
RC Header sponsored by Rocket League
These trick shots are insane
When did you guys decide to covert from a wakeboard to a surfboard? When the RC boats could not reach the 65lbs needed?
When is Overtime coming back!!??
yoooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! trough a ring of fire?!?!?!?!
Let’s go!
These videos are so cool and entertaining
Okay soo have them pull you out of the water?
Cool😎
I got a Dude perfect tooth brush just now.

Making the Impossible to possible is their job
Hi
Great video tho . Been watching you guyz since I was 13 y’all have came a long way these last past years keep going 💯💯💯💯
There was no way you were going to miss the RC car into the hoop. The hoop was 3 feet wide lol
What an annoyingly loud channel
cool
Hey “what is your favorite stunt?” Just wondering
did you guys customise the cars and boats to do these stunts? cause if I were to buy one, would it be able to do these-
Just a loyal fan, commenting because the Dudes asked ☺
I love you guys!! So excited for the tour!!!
Meow
I have a question is it wave boarding in stead of wake boarding
This stuff is crazy dude,sick
Brady
Best video yet!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
if that is Lake Grapevine then i go to the same one
bro this video was sick
ADDED a comment
Pretty ironic how the video is about RC cars, the sponsor is Epic Games, AND YET Not Rocket League XD  Especially after this 3:07 moment
Loving the vids keep it up thankyou when im down on of you always makes me laugh

Great shot Ty
RC Boats Stereotypes
Hvgngtjvg

I can’t imagine how many times they had to recharge or replace the batteries in the RC cars!
Are we gonna ignore cobys laugh when they tried to jump the rc over the building
What was your favorite stunt?  The one at Hawaiian Falls in The Colony!
please do tyler's rage monster complications
Okay okay... Now go watch Mr Beast's video!
his laugh at 5:10 is killing me 😂

5:05 Very Funny scene. And Coby’s laugh is just hilarious
The first one was pretty satisfying
Love your video bro

You're telling me Epic Games sponsored the video(Owner of Rocket League) and you actually did a Rocket League shot yet no mention of the game?!
Just accidentally shouted to my family "Dude perfect just put out a new waterboarding video" instead of "Dude Perfect just put out a new wakeboarding video" 🤦‍♂

Them: wakeboarding Me:  it’s called wake surfing
Awesome
5:10 you're welcome
Cory was chosen for the challenge because he is probably the lightest
3:44 yooo is that a supra??
are the RC cars self levelling? they always land on their wheels
Did Tyler cry?
Very awesome stunts, but he's wakeskating behind the rc boats, NOT wakeboarding.
I like the video but why sponsor the worst game yet 👎👎👎
That’s wakesurfing not boarding
We want an OT!
Wrong sponsor,   Traxxas would like to know your location
Yall late on this one!
Cool videos! Keep up doing those amazing work guys!
The fire ring jump was epic .love the video 👍
Whomever read this I pray that everyone is having abundant health in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen!!!!
I pray that everyone is having a blessed day and night so far in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen!!!!
The rc car driving on water was crazy

Let’s go play some Fortnite!                                   -Cody

I have a Redcat rc and I promise you most of these are really ez to do and require absolutely no skill if you know how to drive one……
quite boring this episode

Many RC cars were harmed in the making of this video
Why isn’t this sponsored by Rocket League?
I saw u in McKinney bike park I bike there so much that makes ur content better

2:07 if youve ever used a rc car you know how delicate I felt that through the screen
Fantastic video. Keep it up
3:06 should be an aerial shot, if you know, you know.

They did not build that hotwheels ramp themselves
hi guys luv ur content
that was amazing the stunts were awesome
dang fortnite zero build dropped a month and a half ago lol, that footage is old
3:08 Rocket League vibes XD
Not to be rude but that’s wake surfing which is even more impressive
wow, thats great!
i LiKe FoRtNiTe' yknow for the sponsor thing you could've done trickshots in fortnite  and also the new thing in forntit eisnt zero build- that was released 2 months ago. The new thing is the new season: VIBIN'. alright thanks  THIS WAS AMAZING  the nostalgia from all those years  bottle flip, soccer and basketball trickshots amazing
How amazing every video is a some I still remember  the first video I ever watched
Rocket league IRL 3:08
hey i’m a big fan
What a awesome video i saw keep it up guys.
2000 mules videos research watch it share it everywhere thanks to Jesus amen justice for children!!!!
you guys didn’t wakeboard w/ RC boats. wakeboard is like a snowboard on water. you’re strapped in connected to the board by bindings…  you mean wakesurfer board
Amazing video!!!!
can you do more overtimes they give summer vibes🤙
Sponsor’s a bit late
by rocket battle 5 it will be nasa rockets
Oh, this is the greatest show I've ever seen!!!

Dude Perfect never disappoints, NEVER
XX
Do you know the double splash me and my friends did it and you guys liked it on Twitter
Only dude perfect can make a Fortnite sponsor ship that actually gets people to install it
3:09 pov: rocket league
Real myth buster type action, awesome work DP, thank you RC cars for all the beats they took!
All is very cool, but if you prepair all and do 100 intents that can be better
I'd like to see an eppisode where you guys make incredible shots and just clap casually just like it was a golf competition.

Fortnite
When is next OT?
Do y’all remember when we actually thought they got these on the first try
They did a version of the hydro plan on vlog creations as a joke and then it actually worked and they lost their rc car cuz they didn't know it was actually possible 😂😂
Probably the only one with no signature signoff by the group as a whole. Still lived up to the hype just as much!!💟
Me halfway thru the vid: SUPRAAA
this is. a comment
Let's go baby!
Banger🔥
Great vid
Me: playing fortnite no builds for 1 year  Them: FORTNITE JUST RELEASED NO BUILDS WITH SOLOS, DUOS TRIOS AND SQUADS
One of the best think about dude is that whatever he achieves something, he never gives the credit to himself, he always respect us and give the credits to us 🥰🥰🥰
I respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best peace that I have ever seen on YouTube hats of to you love your videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰😍😍
This person always tries to do something new and extraordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next video,Love you.🥰🥰🥰😍😍

I love your videos and you should come visit India one day🇮🇳😍
The effort to make this vid, really appreciate it guys!!!
Cool
Jesus loves you
We send rockets to Mars, perform quantum teleportation, create AI that's literally indistinguishable from human. I wouldn't say that RC boats are unbelievable :D

Your channel is dying, pick up your content guys
Dude That Was Perfect
LOVE THE Mk5 SUPRA!!!
3:00 just realised that they covered up the word “Wu-Han” from the gong. If you check older videos it’s still on therr
the fact that fortnite is the sponsor is that the servers are currently down
thanks
The energy in dp videos can power a city for 10 years 🤯🔥🔥
Holy moly , the final one is crazy .
dude perfect has changed since the golden days, idk if it is just cause I'm getting older but they seem more cringe and childish then every before and also: fortine sponsorship like seriously.
I love this channel  My favourite channel on YouTube
Yeah zero build started the video gets out the day it ends
Wow what Incredible stunts 😯
HOW MUCH GAS DID U GUYS WASTE IN DOING THE SECOMD LAST STUNT??
We want bucket list
Love it!!

i wanna see the bloops for 4:00
That was unbelieva
3:46  YOOO IS THAT A SUPRA??!!
The R.C header is so funny! It is literally just rocket league!
I know this video took a long time to make because when he said the sponsor, zero build came out 2 months ago.
I wanted rc car ever since I watched ur 6 years old RC Edition video! I would be so happy if I get a rc car.
Such a great team to watch ever lit & perfect
Love the videos always make me laugh

Nice
Did you see a rainbow?
Top notch quality as always!

Brings tears of joy to my eyes seeing another Dude Perfect video!
Anyone notice the rainbow from the at 2:45 ?
hi
People waking up and truly working hard and then they come with these RC cars that’s truly not that amazing and making tons of money
Hey pls colab with cboys tv.
You can’t even play in that season anymore.
Mrbeast : Recreating Squid game and Charlie and the chocolate factory Dude perfect : Can you wake board on rc boats?
These are all insane especially the wakeboarding
Maybe some day, Dude Perfect will have made all the possible Trick Shot videos, and will have no more ideas for future videos. . .  But today is not that day! Video looks amazing, Dudes!
I want to know how many thousands of dollars worth of rc cars were destroyed to make this video. I would guess 50k. We got a small glimpse on the jump. They totaled at least three. Amazing work, though.
Magnificent effort guys, worth the wait
RC Supra and real Supra look amazing!
This whole video was a W
5:10 That laugh from Coby made my day😂😂
צצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצצ ישראל
Coby is a wizard every time cony was talking and Cody started driving the RC car it failed when coby stopped talking he got it over 🪄
Why was Ty crying
Let the record show that the OG title of this video is: Wakeboarding Behind RC Boats
If I could make videos like any Youtuber, it would be Dude Perfect. They're always having fun.
Potential Idea: Technology Trick Shots? Ex: Far Distance Apple Pencil Sticker
It is a session later
4:30 wow did they really just drop Fortnite zero build…
1:45 you would know this if you are a asphalt Xtreme player
Dude, it was perfect.
These are all nuts!! Another smasher of a video, well done 👏👏

okay but for real that hydroplane was NUTS
I wish DP videos never end.....
Hi
Why do these video cut out out of no where 😑😂
The RC soccer ball shot was like Rocket League in real life.
2:46  The Rainbow coming from the back is mesmerizing!!!
If you are mentally tired and physically tired, and you feel so heavy in your heart, you feel weights in your heart because of your hard work, like studies, chores, responsibilties, and loneliness..  Jesus says;   "Come to Me all those who are weary and burdened, I will give you rest. Take My yoke and learn from Me, for I Am Gentle and Humble in heart; you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is Light"(Matthew 11:28-30)
2:31 There’s no way that the car’s rolling on water! That’s crazy!
did coby wakeboard behind the rc boats because he is the lightest of the group at 65
Amazing so cool
Whoop whoop
😍😍😍
I wanna water ski behind those RCs
4:00 takes parallel parking to another level.
Let's go play some fortnite 💀
I always dreaming to meet you Ty haha, but i think that's impossible
2:45 It made a rainbow!!
YEAH! FORTNITE IS ABOUT TO DROP THE NEW SEASON! Chapter 3, Season 3! I am so excited for the new season!
Great video but this ad for fortnite is a little late as the season just ended
5:10 hahahahahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Go Garret!!!!
Battery operated kids ride-on cars.  Nascar track.  Think about it.
Yooo the car on water created a rainbow
Cool
Overtime is back on Lets go
How did the car run on water?
So cool
LoL
That’s a surfboard not a wakeboard
Just when you thought you couldn't do more with RC 👍🏻👍🏻
3:46 my dream car 🤩

Content is getting bland
That was epic, when is the next OverTime?
Y’all became lame
1:02 u heard that right
What happened to dude perfect plus I miss that

This video is very jealous. I really wanna try it
Rocket League in real life 3:09
Promotes Fortnite no build with 1day left in the season🤦🏻😂
3:10 is rocket league
3:11 rocket league
You guys should do an irl Rocket League battle with rc cars!
Nice car very nice.😯

2:45 it made a rainbow
Bro, I love the fact that at 1:55 you can see all the tire tracks from past attempts, and it shows how much work is put into something that looks so easy when it's not.
i love how they got hyped about fortnite zero build when the season is ending lol
if i could i  cant because i dont got a gaming computer
Great Videos... would you be willing to sell any of your boats.  I have a few non profit ideas that I could use them for.  Message me back if this is something you can do.  thanks

I just love how fortnite sponsors on literally the last day of no builds this season
IS THAT A SUPRA??  & A *mini supra* ?
Dude, today the season ended
Do overtime more often please
The even had rocket league.
Coby was on a wake surfboard not wake board
sorry the fortnihgt siro bild seson alredy ended
Amazing!!!
Looks like a video they finally put effort into
Why did he lie by yelling first try!?
i liked the ryanair landing by ty
Great
Disappointed fellas, that’s not a wakeboard.
The RC boat wakeboarding, absolutely WILD!!!!
“What’s wrong with you, kid?” “You buffoon!” *That Coby Laugh™️* (you know the one) Top tier friendships
Jump into Fortnite when we can’t even play today 😂🙃
Nice
👀💞  Welcome. 💞😘
Cody why do you have to lie, we know you didn’t build it, give the ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO BUILT IT some credit.
This was epic elite 🔥
But today is start of a new season in fortnite🤣🤣
They Fr made irl rocket league
Awweeessssooooommmmmmeeeeeee ENERGY!!! MADE THE DAY! THANX DUDE PERFECT!!!🥳🥳🥳 AND BTW awesome song choice!
The way Coby was laughing at 5:09 had me giggling
I love rc cars and i loved this video bravo
Love you guys!!! You rock 🤘🏻
I don't see anyone talking about how Garrett pulled off that drift between two cars. That was still pretty slick!
I wanna know who helped them with all the math required for that
Amazing
I’m so happy to have another traxxas vids like when you guys drove in water
Guys it would be so cool if you did rocket league with the RC cars and have like little ramps so you can jump and stuff. That would make an awesome vid
what car is that at 3:50
Was your stunt driver Samuel Hubinette?
You should make a video of the playing Fortnite
To think that anyone is actually gonna play fortnite again is just silly
Ok
Where is the extra week wait
Anyone else remember the days when dude perfect just did fun basketball trickshots like we all tried in our backyard?
Next you gotta build the controller into the handle of the wakeboard
Dang
I love how they mention Fortnite Zero Build the day the season it started in ends
🤩
Wow
Wow
not a fan of the quick format.
3:10 "This is Rocket League!!"
Great video!
Today isn't Monday.
Says "wakeboarding" then proceeded to use a wake surf board and not a wakeboard
Keep up the great work
Greatttttttttt vid
Pog
zero build came out a while ago.....
Amazing video 👍👍👍
Can say I’m disappointed in this one. Nothing super crazy. All 10+ takes I’ll be the guy who says it. I expect better
How many rc boats did it take to pull Coby?
I need ur rc cars
lol it is kinda to late now the new season is coming out
Bring back O.T. Pleeeeeeease
3:06 rocket league
That truck pulled a rocket league
I just don’t like fortnite
Technically a wakeboard has something that hold your feet to the board, so that was more of a wakeskate or wakesurf but pretty awesome nonetheless.
IS THAT A SUPRAAAAAAAA
why does this wakeboard idea seem similar to the idea Mr. Beast did with trying to pull a truck with RC cars? but im here for it, with my favorite twin!! honestly seems like such a calm chill ride. I wanna try!!
That boat has some big freaking horse power lol
Im sure this is cool to non RC people, but from a RC person it honestly wasn't very cool.
Lol great video only #2 on trending bc of mr beasts new video love the grind boys keep it up
Overtime pls. Then a bucket list
7:35 HAHAHAHA LET'S DO IT!!! 7:37 I wanna go home.
U guys are the youtuber's I know how long was I waiting for another video
The video is amazing and all but I think you guys spelt waveboarding as wakeboarding
Rocket Leauge

This video is awesome !!!!!!!!!!! I love your videos.   You guys have the best trick shots ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE 😱😱
the wake boarding was pretty impressive. but some of the other RC jumps weren't that impressive.
That’s surfing not wake boarding
Only dude perfect could laugh at breaking countless RC Cars that cost 100s if not 1000s of dollars 😳
Yo
Don’t think that was a wakeboard
What  are your guyses fortnite names
10 yo me: "LETS GO PLAY SOME FORTNITE!!!!!!!"
The last one was epic .
Hi
that header into the gong was rocket league irl!!
3:00 looks like  rocket league
Putting duct tape over the Wuhan sign of the gong.....I see what you did there lol
3:09 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE
They're becoming 2018 mrbeast
you guys are awsome
4:22 when your airpods die
I love Dude Perfect so very much but I was kinda upset and wondering why they didn't post last weekend. Now I can see why. It must have taken a lot of time to build these sets and complete the main task. These guys will always be the best youtubers!
Lol these guys are playing rocket league IRL
Nice
Comment OT If you want more over time OT OT OT OT
Bro Fortnite zero builds came out like two months ago dog 4:45 💀💀💀
This video was sick! You guys are awesome! I made up a playlist of my favorite songs from your videos, and this is definitely on the list now!
that hydroplane through the fire ring, now that's what I call sick
Bro it takes 5 weeks to upload
WAKE BOARDING WITH RC BOATS??? That’s legit man
Who else thought their AirPods were dying at 4:19? 🙋🏻‍♂️
DP OP
there sponser was the day of the live event
This vid is giving me new vibe 🤘🤘🤘🤘love you dp 🤩❤️
Cobyyyyyyyyyy 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love the video! I hope season 3 has zero build as well.
dab
Can you go to Vietnam? (I challenge you)
Kinda reminds me of Rocket League
Why ar u ending video without a conclusion
its the car seats in typhe back of corys truck for me 😂
That's not wakeboarding it's wakeskating
Yo this was one of the most insane videos ever, keep up the great work
absolutely AWESOME
dwadasdwae dd sa (this is my comment)
That was awesome
Rocket league irl lol
Claim your before one mill ticket here. 🎫
Great Vid as Always.
Hi
Who else notice that when the rc car was going across the lake at the end it made a rainbow
Why is this called Wake Boarding? Isn't this called Water Boarding?
Not to be mean but he is surfing and it is not the same thing.
Bruh the fortnight add they did 5 hours later the live event happends and you can’t play of 1 day
Dope video
Awesome guys
Y’all a little late bro we just had an event like earlier and now we waiting for chapter 3 season 3 dude
we missed you!
It's sad when y'all don't sign off with your sig. move
Amazing video! Loved every stunt. Thanks DP.
Coby said that Fortnite just released their zero build mode when it came out months ago and today was the last day of the season, the day this was published. Proof that Dude Perfect really are not Fortnite Epic Gamers.
Why aren’t you posing on Mondays anymore
A
Shot 5 don’t count sorry great try thou!!! 😂
nice
The Supra was sick
That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen... well played
Girls : cry's for when someone dies in a movie. Tyler: cry's when you can't wakeboard on RC cars
Ocean stereotypes bext
I love these guys. I hope they never stop
How do they stay so fresh after tons of years
just copying mr beast at this point
the videos just get better and better every time
Are we not going to look at how Ty's rc had a rainbow behind it. It was truly magical 2:45
At 1:56 they went to Hawaiian falls and I'm not kidding Last Tuesday I had my Birthday party there.
best video in a while! keep it up!

Rocket League?? 3:09
ROCKETTTTT LEAGUEEEEEE
So you held a few buttons? I don't see what makes these incredible.
I wonder how many attempts they take on these stunts 🤔
The Fortnite season ended today and zero build came out march 17. How long did this video take
That was awesome
Rainbow wow 🌈🚖
😪 🚀
if this gets 100k likes that have to jump out of a plane
It is the best trick shot video I have ever seen
I love how that put this out on the last day of the season for Fortnite so that tells i how long this took
This looks epic
Technically that was a wake surf board so then wake surfed behind the Rc boats.
RC Header: Rocket league be like
Bro told us couple hours before the fortnite event
these guys are the defenition of defying odds
Ummm so I’m a critic hearing this because Idk why but zero build released on the 19th of march, idk if it’s even gonna come back cause it’s unplayable rn and it might be a one season thing.
Man these guy are new to rc car and have an xmaxx I wish man but love there content
THAT is a brilliant way to keep your audience's eyes on your video while the sponsor ad is up! I dig the video, as well! Lol. -Vic
Well there 8 minutes of my life I wont get back 🤣🤣 garbage
I am so excited to see y’all that’s happy tour 2022
Would be better if they knew what a wakeboard was…
they got sponsored by fortnite lol
Thats amazing that RC cars can go over water.
When Coby yelled "first try", i was dying🤣
why do you make this video and say fortnite zero builds when its been out for LIKE TWO MONTHS
There sponsoring Fortnite season 2 when there’s not even a day left of it😹
Zero build was three months ago hahaha
Shesh
I love the no build in Fortnite!!!!!
Thanks for more Rc content.👍
RC boats wake boarding should be in a Mark Rober video
great vid
Congratulations! Love seeing that awesome feat!
anyone else miss the outros? :(
Way too much screaming
You guys are awesome
I was saying No Way through this whole Video!💋Magnifique
What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! Chat has been disabled for 4 seconds...
A triumph!

Dude prefect also performs amazing trick shots
Can’t wait for the bloopers vid😂
“No RC cars were hurt in this video… maybe.”
Just amazing and perfecta as usual

I think you should do trick shot stereotypes
Loved it
Thoroughly enjoyed the rocket league 3 minutes in
Hi
You guys are always coming with unique, amazing, and beautiful content. Seeing trick shots after long time. We missed trick shorts. 🤜🏼🤛🏼🙇🏻‍♂️
First
Technically he was surfing but oh well
I still wanna know where we're going... 🤷🏻‍♂️
Done
1st
gooder
I just drove past yalls headquarters. Random fact!  Yall are great
Wile the car was going fast in the water I saw a rainbow behind it
Noice
When is OT 34 coming
I think your a couple months behind on that sponsor there.
Way To Go Coby
love it
great
3:07 irl rocket league??
Puts a smile on me whenever i watched your videos.. best way to start the day, thanks guys !!
I can't play fortnite I need the new map😪
Also can we notice that they said fortnite just realesed zero build the day the zero build season ended
Zero Build, download
Being from Frisco it’s so funny knowing every location you film at
Great vid 👍🤜
Nice shot Ty with the rc in the flaming hoop
Nice bro
👍
Nice bro
I love Cody's faint yell of 'no' at 5:08 xD
theres a rainbow created at 2.46
No way they just did rocket league with rc cars
Technically that’s wakeskating, not wakeboarding, when your feet aren’t locked in, and is even more difficult than normal wakeboarding!
✿ï⒨ԍⓐɤℓ0L͛〄
1:00 “buckets” is a VERY deceiving word😅😅
NEVER MIND! AMAZING VID!
Incredible video guys!!! TEAM CORY ALL THE WAY THOUGH!!!
cool vid!
This is debatably the worst dude perfect video ever made
3:10 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!
PLEASE ADD MORE REAL LIFE TRICK SHOTS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR LIKE 10000 YEARS!!!!!!!!!
These man fell off
maybe that was new 2 months ago
Actually that was 3 tries to do that ramp stunt
I don't know what's crazier, Jamie Hyneman skiing behind a Rowing team or RC boats polling Coby on a wake board and sustaining that speed.
yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2:46 rainbow trail
The first trick alone got you a like. Keep working Dude Perfect!
Cody, where did you find those sunglasses?
Hu
If someone doesn’t invent some kind of machine to wake board with out a boat, I’d be surprised…
These are all nuts
Lame
“CODY!! YOU BUFFOON!!” Line of the video! 🤣
What? Fortnite.
🐒💕🙏
lee
Well that's a blooper 0:38
CMON ITS BEEN THREE MONTHS SINCE THE LAST OVERTIME PLS POST IT
I love how they show the process of the RC boats pulling them it really makes you appreciate more and get more exited and amazed
Pog
Last 15 sec of video is the title. “Old dudes”. Hang it up
these are the videos we want
W
Its funny how they are sponsored by Fortnite for this video, but Fortnite is currently down till tomorrow because of the event today with Ch3 Season 3 coming tomorrow.  Imagine how someone would react if they downloaded Fortnite because they saw this video and had to look at the downtime screen the whole day. XD
You guys are cool
Glad to see you're still uploading!
Man they are living a life. Has the coolest job in the world. Love you guys.😀
But still answer
Jk
where are all the fans?  C'mon guys! More views!
Hiii
Please dear Lord do some more basketball trick shots.  I have loved the progression of your story and success,  but I miss the original trick shots so much!!! Come on guys! Pound it. Noggin. See ya!!!
Very impressive
I’ll be the number one comment until they answer
This video was amazing, and looks like it took so much time to make! Another amazing video, as usual.
2:45 Pretty sure I'm not the only one who saw that rainbow, right? 🔥
7:30 AWWWWW!!!! Was Ty crying??🥺 This just shows how much work they put into these videos. It not only affects them physically, but also emotionally!!
Did I read the thumbnail right o.o, *NOW THIS IS WHY no one beats DudePerfect* , also dosnt take a rocket scientist to tell you, that you could only doing that rc boat WHEN THE WATER ISNT CHOPPY LIKE THE first take, obviously its gana work on a calm lake, DUHHHH😂😂😂 flipping heck 60% of people wouldnt even of noticed
Someone needs to tell them that they're about 6 months late for that sponsorship line.
Btw that’s not wakeboarding
Where can I buy some of those rc cars
Wow
Sorry but I would like to play fortnite right now but there is a remake of the black hole basically
i love you dude perfect i cant wait for the next overtime and bucket list!
Love seeing the bloopers as well.
I love the rocket league one
down bad one of the coolest, best dp vids i have seen in a long time, the music hits different
One of the best videos I’ve ever seen!
I did all of the stuff
I was just talking about you guys to my wife, that you spent a vacation where I live (Destin), and was wondering how you guys been doing since 2017 or '18. Boom, All I needed is to look at trending.
Rocket League in real life! 3:12
Zero build has been out...
You are not wakeboarding a wakeboard has boots that Is a wakesurf board
Great job
I was waiting si much for another rc video. Great job guys! You're the best!

It’s cool that you got a sponsor from Epic
I need to buy an RC car
Y’all should make a Football stereotype
No pound it or nog it? 😢💔
Dude, I love RC cars
How!?
Everyone subscribe I’ve been going for so long let’s get to 100,000,000 for them
Nothin but bangers!
Legit
Sick vid!
i loved the loopy looper
Wanna talk about how they sponsored Fortnite but you can play until tomorrow also today is June 4th for people if they see this later.
I really like how you guys mixed both the normal stereotypes format in with the wakeboarding setup. Definitely keep doing that!
Cyfgfdxstrfdschg
ii would love ot see the bloopers  from this vid
Watch these videos with my son everyday! We are always so amazed!!
Tell Epic Games to get back on Unreal Tournament.
Ty is better at fake crying than Amber Heard😂😂😂😂😂😂
3:15 is actual rocket league lol
The fortnite ad while it’s he last day of the season😂🤣
holy these videos r cool
When people say they're out of ideas, just show them this clip 3:06
they should make a hotel stereotypes
7:31 I can’t tell if his cry is fake or real
1:03 what did he say…
AMAZING!! GREAT JOB!!!!!!
isnt that wake surfing not wake boarding
yall should do rc cars soccer
When are you doing the next ot
I love watching ur videos they make my day turn to a great day thank for ur vids
Lol zero builds in fortnite has been out for a month or so
Rocket league in real life
yessir
LIKED COMMENTED AND SHARED
Can’t believe y’all thought of this
Why are u guys so fun to watch
Lol the little hyrdo planing car made a rainbow 😂🤣
Rocket League should take notes for some other game modes
SMASH THE LIKE BUTTON!!!
RIP the old editing style
how long ago did they film this zero bilds bin out for a month
The RC Car after scoring the header: Suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
New rocket league video because they can do stunts with rc
Dude perfect once again killing it with the music.
Is it just me, or is Dude Perfect rich enough to not find that RC car out of the the tree and bought a new one.
Can I just have one of those cars I don’t care if I have to fix it up😂😂
really feel like they phone in these videos now a lot of the work used to be done by them now it feels like 99% of everything is setup and they are there to just film the shot and leave nothing else there isn't any passion behind it now. I mean even the sponsor like Zero build was just released? HUH its been out for months and the point of a sponsor is to make people wanna go play out of ANY time to release it was like 1 hour before the fortnite event and after the event you cant even play the game anymore so prob about half the people that see the vid wanna play the game cant cause its down until tomorrow for the update. Such high productions by people that are not passionate about it anymore... depressing where this channel has gone.
Epic games I want them to go out of bussiness
Did you even know that the day you posted this they took out zero build
RC wakeboarding I think yes
Орут как потерпевшие после любой херни и поведение как у деградантов. С меня отписка и дизлайк. Вообще непонятно как я тут оказался. Кроме того, кое в чем Задорнов был все-таки прав
I'm going to your consert
The RC header trickshot at 3:06 instantly reminded me of rocket league.
2:46 did you guys saw the rainbow..?
insane guys!
I can’t be the only one thinking on the wakeboarding one he was on a surfboard 😂
I can’t be the only one thinking on the wakeboarding one he was on a surfboard 😂
You should do more rc videos, we all love them, and so exciting!! Next time, use like submarines and drones/rc planes. That would be ultra. Maybe have a drone/place rc battle, or a battleship/submarine battle rc sponsored by world of warships (Lol)
ironic yall just set out fortnite no builds cause the live event happened at 4 and it is now unplayable lol
Ya
hi
And if you think Jesus walking on water was impressive, check out 2:32
I bet that was a world record with the rc boat wake boarding.....👍👍👍
Yo! Guys when ya'll going to do another overtime ??
The funny thing is that this is the last day of this season for fortnite
I love this keep doing what your doing
I was so waiting for them to just slide the RC car into the parking spot instead of the real car and be like easy peasy
New vid🙌
i miss so much dude perfect i watch them when im 8 years old and im here to watch again dude perfect!💖🔥
Still waiting for the super bowl overtime!!
Fortnite is sadly down now... but I'll try tomorrow.
Is that a SUPRA!!!
I find it rather ironic that the guys filmed this when Fortnite Chapter 3, Season 2 began and released it on the day the season ended
The ball bounces up, Justin's there he score!!!!! THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!!
Shot 5 is literally Rocket League
I remember watching Dude Perfect when I was in like 2015 after school with their soccer challenges. All the memories with them man!
Didn't Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 3 end at 4 Today?
A True Quote From Halloween Stereotypes, first the haters "what are those guys like 60?" Then the true fans say " No, They're in their Prime."
Unmanned surfboarding
This is one of the best videos in a while, you guys are on a roll!
Ty that ring jump was insane
No way this works
two words " school stereotypes"
wooo
Do overtime 32 plzzzz
Epic games? No thanks
At 5:30 "Lest go play som fortnite" said no one
Now those were some trick shots!
Am I the only one who thought this was like a overtime or a battle??
Going to be honest guys bad timing to talk about that because the season just ended
Cool
Anyone else see the rainbow behind the rc car when it went across the lake
Rope trick shots. Next.
Can’t wait for your next videos! Especially bucket list.
Great video! You must have spent thousands of dollars on RC cars over the years
Amazing stunts!
Can't wait to watch overtime 34
10 second audio on repeat for 8 minutes was the best idea
Nice job Coby!!!
Bro by the time that put this out fortnight live event is about to start
Commenting cause Ty told me to
These stunts are crazy
44
bola do peixão?
Shot 5: Rocket league
Ggs on #1 on trending
Please do more bloopers
When are you guys bringing back overtime
But. But that’s not wakeboarding. This whole vid is a lie
That was pretty mint!!
i cant wait for next ot
The quarter mile did it for me🤘🏻🤘🏻
3:10 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUEEE!!
I thought my AirPods died in the drift part 💀💀
THEY PLAYED ROCKET LEAGUE IRL
Is iss thatt a Supppprrrraaaaaa
Awesome vid! But I do have to point out how late that sponsor was... Zero Build came out forever ago, let's not mention that the season has ended on this day!
Bro, There literally telling us about zero build when it is almost over and everyone knows about it
How do you do these trick shots
Y’all never have a repeat video. New content every time

Is everyone just gonna skip over the fact they literally made Rocket League irl?!  3:00
i love your vid!!!
Cool
hello great video
What rc cars do y’all use?
If Dude perfect was from the UK they’d be screaming “SIU” and not “Let’s go!”
Irl rocket leage
Wow!! Wakeboarding behind RC boats!!! that must of been a thrill!!!😁😁. Love this content keep it up!!!
It’s hilarious how the day they post this video, the Fortnite season ends, and we are now in downtime.
It takes so long for your videos to come out though
I miss dude perfect consistency with every other Monday post.
It’s been so long since an overtime
3:00 why is there rocket league footage in this video?
nioce
Can y'all please start making the longer videos again?
Get Dude perfect to 60 million by the middle of Next Year!
What an amazing video just speechless 😶
These videos are better then Logan Paul’s
Legends

Gare the gator.

Yall are the best people.😯😯🤟👐and awesome.
I love how y’all advertise Fortnite when that season just ended today😂 love the vid btw
3:05 This...     *IS ROCKET LEAGUE*
when u posted the season ended
0:56 EDIT: The lamp post landing with the back area, the GIANT hoop, the RV circle jump, the gong header, not landing the RV in the ring of fire jump . Entertaining, but a little too easy for my taste.
awesome!!!!!
Insane
💪👍
Epic Games... Brumak...!
Rocket league in real life

I’m amazed at how fast Coby was cruising behind those rc boats
Let’s get the boys to 60 million subs!
3:13 bro is playing Rocket League irl
why didnt anyone think to hire an engineer to put bigger fuel tanks on the boats and make them controllable from the rope?
There are some really awesome jumps there! Way to go Dude Perfect!
They never disappoint!
E
Hi
Yo that ish look like the rocket league battle pass
You ar the best
The only part that sucks about this video is…  When you wake board with out straps it’s called WAKE SURFING!
And also fortnite event to
cool
these guys never disappoint
Fortnite
I LOVE DUDE PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!
So how many Rc trucks did you all destroy making this video ?
Wait were those dirt jumps at a jump park called erwin if so thats where i normally ride

How many cars did you break in this episode?
The fortnite add is a little to late lol, but great vid
So so epic, truly incredible this video
How about a return to Ohio to do something with the new Goodyear airship? 🤔
Yeah that was amazing! Thanks for all the effort that y’all put into your vids! Awesome music too
Bro we can’t play there was a live event now we can’t play
They had a fortnite zero build ad at the end of the season🤦‍♂️

Make a Harry Potter fight scene
Can you make a school stereotype
i never you cars could drive on water. LES GO BOYS!
Oooh I see that mk5 Supra!
Some of the best trick shots I have seen them do .
Why do you have to shout  all the time…just talk. Ffs.
THE PARALLEL DRIFT PARKING INSANE
Fire

cant really check out fortnite because of the event
commenting for Tyler :)
Quite the dad laugh there at 5:12
After a brief hiccup between 2021 and 2022, Dude Perfect is not only back, but Dude Perfect is taking things to the next level.

Commet
nuthin they do is perfect. they use A.I for editing.
We need another overtime
Hi
Always a fan of the channel. Too bad it’s a dud of a sponsor.
I want an rc car so bad I wish
I love how it’s a bunch of late 30s early 40s year old men playing with RC cars and yelling at the top of their lungs. Would give anything to go visit another country and do the stuff they do tho. It’s so sick.
Hi
Can get a rc car
I want to know who started every person and athlete saying "LET'S GO!" after everything, so Will Smith can go slap them.
your about an entire season late for zero build Fortnite
is it me or did one of them say the F word
That rc car is better at soccer then I will ever be.
Wow, what a video, not only was it great content from the trick shots and all, but you guys made me laugh so much!! Amazing content, keep it up!
you guys are awesome
So awesome!!!!
nice
That was crazy
You could’ve Just call the rc header the rocket league shot
The editors are so 🔥 👌
Can I maybe FaceTime you dud perfect it has been a dream
Nice video
Love these guys
Well that’s……. perfect
i was at that water park last weak
Love your videos keep it up
I wish I could have a RC car
Hi
Dude Perfect needs to be in fortnite
They literally combined their weeks of high effort, money, patience and time in 8 minutes....😇😊🥰❤🥰😍  Hats off....😇😇😇❤❤
WHY FOR GOD’S SAKE ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT FORTNITE INSTEAD OF ROCKET LEAUGE! I MEAN COME ON, THIS IS RC CAR TRICKSHOTS
SICK.
you guys are the best!!!!!!!!!
Long live the Kings of YouTube!
Wow
awesome video dudes i would not believe that would be possible to water ski with rc boats but it is i guess and i am so pumped for the upcoming summer dude perfect videos this summer is got to be lit dudes! :)
Why is there no pound it noggin see ya?!?!?
I did everything ty said to do after the fire jump
Le me: After seeing my own answers and results  5:10 🤣🤣🤣
All your series are literally EPIC, whatever you do don’t stop making content.
This makes me want to play rocket league
Awesome video!
okay, well can you use a bunch of RC aeroplanes to pull a human glider?
Awesome 😎😎😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍
I mean the second was pretty easy
So can you guys tell me y you promote shooting and killing games I know your a kid channel I don't know if you thought about but there is a lot of shootings today with real guns I believe games like that program kids minds even when you don't think it does life just becomes cheap but that's not real life life is very real pp matter if you say your a Christian y promote those games
They didn’t even mention the new season!
These guys just made rocket league irl
My childhood dream
So cool you guys are awesome what makes you cooler is that you are all Christians!!!!
You guys got a sponsor from fortnite and by the way the season for fortnite has ended
Ty, are you okay?
I really want to do this sometime 😁
DP is the only group that all the members are still around and havent broke up. True meaning of friendship. These guys deserve everything positive that comes there way
dp ❤❤
I am getting pumpd for Overtime 34
that toyota supra tho
What’s the noise when garret parked the RC car next to the two white trucks I thought my headphones were turning off XD but either way this vid just like all the other are a banger
Hi
Is it just me or are people just not as impressed with dp anymore?
did cory just swear? 1:02
If this video doesn’t get at least a million likes then idk what will
Ok but wakeboarding is riding the wake and he was in the calm water behind the wake so it’s more like smooth boarding
You guys make me cry 😭
Do they know that the fortnite live event just happened?
That’s crazy
🔥🔥
1:02  what did I hear there?
I like how the car on the loop looks like the toy story car
never fail to deliver ❤👏👏
I just love y’all
Dudes out here playing rocket league in real life
Wowowowow🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:03 foreshadowing a betcha for ot 34?
did cory say "lets go brandon"? if he did, noice
Lol the way coby laughed after coby missed the 125 ft jump was funny. Oh I love dude perfect it gives the the best vibes
I love this video
Wakeboarding is with straps on your feet. That was wakesurfing
The live event for fortnite happened already so if they try to play fortnite it will be a waiting screen
I have been watching you guys for so many years I have lost track. Very disappointing to see your videos these days. You made us wait for three weeks for an 8 minute video. Your enthusiasm just seems fake these days. And what ever happened to the DP Extra channel? How Ridiculous is killing it these days! You guys need to do better!
This was my favorite one guy's
🐣🐣🐣👻👻👻
IRL Rocket League be like: 3:09
That was awesome!! Keep them coming! I love your guys videos!
Do rc car videos more often
Bucket list is the best thing to happen to dude perfect hands down!!!
Toe
3:08 “This is rocket league!!!”
1000000th view
3:08 shoul’ve said: THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE
its a shame they bring it up the day 0 build is gone
Awesome
1:02 I think a swear word was said.
Y'all gatta find a way to play rocket league with real rc cars lol
fortnite zero build lol
im guessing they made this video like 1 or 2 months ago since zero build came out a long time ago. It's kind of ironic because the event was today and he said jump in play right now even though the event downtime is happening right now.
So many work and money for 8 Minutes? Bad
that is cool
It’s a surf board not a wake board
lessssggooooooooo
New betcha idea, coby betcha he can wakeboard behind Rc boats for for one mile
4:35 the season ended but ight
RC rocket league game?
Press F to pay respect for the 2 nights of sleep Cody lost making that loop de loop
Amazing!!👌
What's up y'all got this
Awesome video but that was a wakesurf board not a wakeboard
e
Imagion Rocket League irl with RC's
Ty’s house is literally my dream house. He has earned it though. Congrats on all the hard work.
Who else thought about Rocket League at 3:08?
This was by far one of the best yet
This is awsome
🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
Amazing video, i love this idea. But i think you should add some fails. Just to extend the video more, WE WANT TO SEE MORE.
Is that a world record?
They never miss I swear😧
Why didn't you post a video like in 3 weeks??????
Looking forward for your response and to meet you all if possible
Like all the OT shows
POV: you watched mr.beast chocolate video after this
We need more dp plus videos
Wakesurfing but ok
Estaba esperándolo 😍🤩
So cool!!
Man the edits are clean huge respect to the editors and DP
so when we doing hard trickshots again?
Where was the dirt track with all the jumps?
Nice
Awesome!!! Traxxxas sponsored!!!!
3:15 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!!!
Wsp dude perfect
hi
2:44 What made this even better was a rainbow trail appearing behind the RC car
Not gonna lie, I got chills watching Coby wake board behind those RCs. That has got to be one of the most epic wins out there. And to give it to Coby just makes it that much more special since he doesn't have a great history of getting a lot of wins.
Dp never disappoint us. This was epic!!!
It’s annoying how you’ll call it wakeboarding that’s not even close to wake wakeboarding🤡 it’s called A wake surf bord a wakeboard is completely different🤦‍♂️
When I was reading the title, I literally thought they were sleeping and somehow woke up boarding RC boats 😂
922,490 views, 101k likes, 2.8k comments, 57.5M subscribers. Nice!!
Funny how Fortnite no build dropped quite a while ago.
3:10  Rocket League Players: *Pathetic*
Them: '' We're about to attempt 10 impossible rc stunts''  Also them: Proceeds to ace all of 'em!
Rocket league in real life
Boats or toasts
Letss gooo another DP vid
Bruh it’s almost an new season I’m in the event rn
Not wakeboarding but still sick video!
Hello... there
Amazing!!!
Awesome video as always!!! Like and comment if you think that DP should collab with That’ll Work! Hopefully DP will see this!
3:12 this is rocket league
You r so a legend
You guys are soo cool i love your videos i really appreciate the effort and time you put into your videos. Props to the editor.
When u we're talking it was so funny cause Cody kept going🤣😂
What kind of rc truck was that I'm trying to find one that rides on water
I don’t even wanna know how many RC cars they broke
not even a wakeboard that's a wake surf board which means it floats better than a wakeboard so don't call it wakeboarding without a wakeboard
they filmed this a long time ago
Cool
Food trick shots
Rocket league irl!!
Still amazing after all these years!
Those poor rc cars lol
Love it
I just stop watching the ring of fire Rc trick Shots
Today is my birthday
This videos so cool
Yesss!!! More dude perfect!
Everytime i heard the “let’s do this” i got chills
That’s was surfing not wakeboarding still cool tho
AWESOME. now I want to order an RC car
Dave
Your content getting boring and kind of annoying
cool
3:10 this is rocket league ✌🏻😂
You needed to have Johnny Cash's song :Ring of fire playing in the background during the ring of fire jump. Ha Ha
Sheeeeeesh
I really wish I could join dude perfect but I am way too young to join DP
Epic
Awesome video post dude perfect
Why they have a surfboard and not a wake board
IM COMING TO THE TOUR IN SUNRISE FLORIDA!!!!
Luka Doncic special - might this be possible?
Finally an interested video after a longggg time
So ... flying with drones next ?
Awesome video but curiousity question, why don't you guys do your 'pound it, noggin' outro's anymore or your 'We're dude perfect, welcome to RC stunts' style intro's anymore??
Best ever
So entertaining. A shame these aren't twice as long.
nice
That was amazing.
You should do air soft trick shots or stereotypes
Dude perfect accidentally founded the ingredients for irl rocket league
Let’s be honest, Zero Builds is the most fun anyone’s had on Fortnite since playground was first introduced
htcbu
Love the videos and content keep it up
they never fail my expectations
Real life rocket league 😂
Bruuuhhh ok the wakeboarding behind the rc boats was sick!!!!! Great video guys!!! ❤️
Suggestion: add a "how many tries it took" counter before or during every "trick". I think that would really stress the Intensity of them! Love the content!
fav music
Coby’s laugh at 5:11 lol
Love the video but just want a new ot
So who’s going to tell them that they posted this on the day that the season ends
Does the Hoopy Looper remind anyone else of that one Danny MacAskill video?
Let me know
E
Mecha commander leader is the crew  pack
love trick shots,by the way is anyone excited for the event?
Devour vs mecha commander leader
Fortnite live event is 48 mins
Holy smokes all of that was insane!!!
only 5h old video lol lets see this
Your videos are the best hope you can get more than mrbeast
That was unbelievab....
more rc plese
zero builds came out 3 months ago
The car that y’all used at the race track looked like the one that you used at Bristol on tour
Super cool vid!
It’s crazy how they keep the drone with the camera so smooth and you can see the car the whole time. Great job!
I love the bloopers 😂😂
Hawaiian falls in the colony
Love u guys wish i could meet u
3:08 is a real life rocket league shot
RC VIDEOS  ARE ON THE MOST FAVOURITE IN THE CHANNEL , IT SO GREAT TO WATCH THERE COMEBACK🚤🚤
Favorite Stunt is the wave boarding
awesome idea, love it
This is cracy
The RC header with the gong looks like the RC shifted weight midair
Insane vid as always
How about those Sidemen reactions? “HE’S DONE IT!!!”
It’s not my birthday, so can I have a pin please?
Jesus loves you so much....plz eat of his flesh and drink of his blood. Trust in him and him alone
if you had 2 wake board ropes you could steer the rc boats
What are the odds I buy a Traxxas 3 days ago and you make a video of them lol
Guessing they’re gonna be changing the title to “Rc car trick shots” or “Craziest Rc Trick Shots”  just a guess though.
When are you coming to India
Living the dream❤️
no RC Cars were hurt in the making of this video.... Hopefully
i LOVE it
You all should do this idea and team up with rocket league!
Um that’s not a wake board
RC stuff is amazing!!!
awesome!!!
Amazing 😁
This is so fun to watch!
THIS IS SICKKKK
Tyler the goat
fortnite was a long time ago
Yes overtimes are the BEST
I'm surprised that epic games sponsored them in stead of traxxas
why is there content so quality
YEET
thought it said waterboarding :skull:
Each one is more innovative than the last
Is it just me or are they just cringe now?
😮
Stunt 5 is literally the epitome of a rocket league arial
Just checked yesterday to see if there was a new upload. And this comes today. Awesome guys 👏🏽👍🏽
Ha
Sound at 4:19 had me thinking my AirPod battery was dying
Amazing was the rainbow behind the car in river
Overtime?
Hey look, a BMW
It always bums me when is finish a dude perfect video
I love RC cars & dude perfect, which Is the reason why I did a trick shot channel because of Dp & a Traxxas channel also! Keep up the awesome work!!!
Yeet
Great job lion
love the sponsor
Love ya dudes I’d really like if you guys like this 😃
Ayy let's go
Wouldn't the R/C Boat wake board be a Guinness World Record?
3:45 suprrrraaaaaaaa!!!!
That wasn’t a wakeboard
Awesome
bru u wasting ur time ur adults
The way coby laughs
Nice vid
what if you guys did real life rocket league?
That´s not a wakeboard  -.-
Can't wait for the next over time or bucket list
great job with these rc stunts, dp!
oh brilliant!
im sorry i have to ask. how many cars have u broken in this video ...
Love the video best of 2022
I love dude perfect 🤩
Nice
you guys are amazing plz pin my coment
I love your video
Who else wants mor ot or ot 34
Amazing
I really dig this format! More quality over quantity, putting in a bit more behind the scenes and bloops rather than 3 seconds of perfection.    I always wonder how long each of these shots really take and how labor intensive it is. I hope this is more sustainable, using your existing shots and really building on them. Gotta say I appreciate this style more. Blend between Bucket List & Trick Shots.
Will we get another overtime
👍😂
I like rc drift car's🙂🪄
जिन्दगी में इतना बड़ा बन जाओ की अपने माता पिता की हर ख्वाहिश पूरी कर सको !!❣️❣️.❣️❣️💘
You guys make my day, everytime you upload. MORE OT!
Can't wait for ROCKET BATTLE 3!!! LETS GO DUDES!!!!!!!!!
That’s not a wakeboard 💀
Wow👏🏻
Way to go ❤🎉
Only OG’s will remember the building in Fortnite.
i love you all❤
Oi wake boards have boots and are skinny. That there is a wake surfing board.
Do basketball trick shot video with Luka Doncic when he comes back to USA🏀😎
The titles don’t even say what the video is anymore this channel is so horrible now I mean what’s the point
Not going to lie I thought, after seeing the title, that it was an overtime episode and they were playing you bett-cha
what a nice Luka jersey Cody has on
Awesome
This has to be my favorite DP video of 2022. Great work guys.
gamer stereotypes pls
art
2:46 it formed a rainbow behind the rc car, thats cool
Never disappointed!! Awesome video!
I like how they say that zero build just released but the season that had it has pretty much ended
Who wants more OverTime
I love how theres ducks at the end

wow
The fact this video is sponsored by epic games is insane
What Fortnite sponsered someone
Overtime 34 Cool not cool Get crafty Fight secen  Top 10 overtime videos

Pound it noggin
LOVED IT YALL NEVER DISSAPPOINT
Who’s winning the NBA finals
Dude Perfect is the best
I doubt you’ll will see this but it would be nice if you could send me one of those ex cars that can hydroplane
Since when does dude perfect post on a Saturday? I remember every other Monday they would drop a new video
Wow
One of your most insane videos in years! So impressive! DP forever!
Love your song sir ❤️ Lets do this 👍🏻
That mavs  jersey👀👀
tha'ts no wakeboard. That's a skimboard.
3:45 Is that a  ... Is that a .. Is that a, SUPRAAA ?
Yes
Do the videos stop early for anyone else?? I didn't get to see the outro it just cut in the middle of Cody saying, "Unbelievable."
Rc boat was awesome, definitely on my bucket list.
Hehe
0:50 I pulled two all nighters    The song: *somthing somthing* *allnighters*
Banger
hey why where you guys in Qatar like a few weeks back? is it for a video or something? i wish i could have met you...
remember when they use to be in their prime and there videos where impressive
I want OT
I love all your videos  Especially OT
POV: Rocket league irl. 3:00
Talking about fortnite zero build and the season ends today lol. This really shows how much effort they put into their videos.
This is a banger video
This was AMAZING keep it up
5:10 Is it just me or does he sound kinda like Palpatine when he laughs like that?
Loved it
Lol every time I watch I love these videos
That ring of fire jump Was insane awesome
3:10 Litteraly Rocket League
Let’s goooo
When you don't know if the video is a trick shot, a battle, wishlist or a road
Coby got possessed by a demon 5:09....
YOU GOT A SPONSER FROM FORTNIGHT!!!
Does any body know where they were when there was all those dirt jumps? The trick was called the triple stack helicopter
Poor Sledge Sacrificed it’s life for the roof to roof jump
Pleas see this great vid btw
Sponsored by epic games oh no
I am so exited for the tour when it comes to St. Louis
3:44 yooo is that a supraaaaa
WOW! 3:40
Best reaction or best thing happened in last ❤️
2:46 BRO WTH THE CAR LITERALLY MADE A RAINBOW
The moment he said lets go play some fortnite. I unsubscribed
Can you give me one RC car Huge fan  from india
Ooo a racing video. I’m going to enjoy this  Day 24 of asking for School Stereotypes
That RC Car on water was forming a rainbow trail at the end...
Who else thinks Dp should do American Football stereotypes? 🏈
This channel really worths the number of subscribers ❤
This is the worst Dude Perfect video I’ve ever seen
Hate to be that guy but that is wake surfing not wakeboarding
Keep it up
I love it so much
I’m so absolutely dead inside these don’t even get a reaction from me I’m numb I hurt it sucks
𝐀𝐰𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐬 𝐠𝐮𝐲𝐬
2:59 Rocket leauge irl
You guys should play rocket leag with them
You guys should do a rc boat battle!!!
Cody should get pit vipers
I am looking forward to the new bucket list!  I wonder where it is going to be?!?
but can you wakeboard behind RC cars over water???
Hi
3:11 # Rocket league
How is every song different, but also the exact same every epsisode lol
Finally they succeeded
3:08 rocket league irl
Amazing!! I love this video!
DP content get better 8n every episode, love your work! Keep it up
I know money is tight, but you're literally advertising chinese spyware to kids...
The awkward Ty energy at 5:55 is probably my favorite type of Ty energy! 😍🤩😂
rocket league vibes
But everybody that thinks it is fake it takes some multiple tries they should  videos  the behind scenes of the video
That’s not a wakeboard it’s a surfboard but still really impressive great video
I was playing vr my mom was watching ur stereotypes and i heard ur intro and i guessed it right and my mom said “How you know” and I said i watch all the time
No wonder this channel has over 55 million subscribers... Kudos to the boys... 🙏 Well done 😁😁😁
Tyler is your closest friend on dude perfect Garrett?
We want ots
Cool Tiler
That’s literally INSANE how far he went with rc’s
It's funny they mention this in the video about Fortnite building on the last day of the season when it first got announced 3 months ago
3:01.  DP be doing Rocket League IRL
That was amazing impossible content always making our days!
That’s technically surfing not wakeboarding
Love you guys soooo much
NİCE! 🇹🇷
This is so cool
Little late on the sponsor lol
I’ve loved y’all for almost my whole life
Let’s give some credit where it’s due to those crazy rc cars and boats
Hold on, hold on Epic Games sponsored you!?
SO COOL!
Like actually how much???
Paraglider next?
We love you Dude perfect from ‏Saudi Arab ❤️❤️🇸🇦🇸🇦💚💚👍👍
1:44 Trackmania ice level experience
I can confirm hazrat isa (a.s) aka jesus was controlling one of the rc cars

3:13 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!!
I did everything but I can’t share because I have no friends

How many rc cars has been destroyed for this vid Lol
3:00 that was som real rocket league stuff
Hi
that car became jesus
i just wanna know ..... How many rc cars / boats did they break to make this vid
Z
Send me 1k
No he had that that was just him being bad at wakeboarding
Nice
The edits are always so clean. Props to the editors and DP!!!
Since you can wake board behind rc boats, now let's see if you can fly with rc helicopters
If you pause it at 2:18 you can see that it actually is not core it is a action figure a core being pulled by a RC car
Is that a supra 🏎
Zero build is just apex
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content ⁦⁦🏆
That would be crazy to experience, wakeboarding with basically no wake!
These guys are always having some fun adventure, looks like it would be fun to be apart of their group 😂
Can we all agree Dude Perfect are the perfect youtubers to watch while eating food
Woah! That was just unbelievable
world record farthest distance wake boarded behind rc boats? 👀
I'm honestly impressed by the time and effort you guys put into these videos, Keep it up! eDe
Thanks for the amazing stunt!  I hope there are more coming! Your team is still the best even after all these years.
3:10 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE
me and my son cant wait till june 24th when you come to birmingham al
1:33 what is this park’s name?
That was amazing. One of your best videos
How long does this take to make these sorts of videos or the stereotypes
This video was great and all, I just don’t understand how it took them 4 weeks to put out.
Rip sidhu moosewala 💔🕊

ye
Taco
Best stunts yet! Did NOT disappoint! Y'all are really great at what you do!
Insane
It‘s so coole l to See this
But but you didn’t use a wakeboard. You used a wake surfing board which is more like a surfboard while a wakeboard is closer to a snowboard
How about a video on the best and worst places you have been, in  all the years you have been doing stunts,tricks, and videos. Or a video on all the places you have visited since the beginning of dude perfect.
looking forward to OT 34 :) It has been a while
too bad i cant afford to anything fun like this with my typhon, would love to take it to the skate park but i dont even have a car, just a guy that works on minimum wage at sonic
3:24 65lbs of *force  pounds are a unit of force, not pressure
Love the original content! You guys have been amazing for years!
Dudeperfect
Is anyone going to talk about on how ty's monster truck can drive on water?  Its insane how that rc car  can go on water
Where is the video in qatar
8:21 Let's go Brandon!!!
Great video. Ya’ll should do a real life rocket league battle with RC cars!
really Fortnite you're still trying to not dye
i have a feeling the loop is gonna get rage monstered
⬇️ Another Overtime chain here⬇️
That's sick
haven't even watched this yet and i already know it's gonna be a BANGER!
The rainbow showing during the water quarter mile drive was a nice touch.
love that this video drops with a sponsor of epic for zero build ON fortnite season 2 end day XD
yet another excuse to give the editors a raise.
5:09 that laugh got me
what a video, great job fellas
Wake surf***** not wake boarding
You guys are the best

Fortnite is soooo bad it is so lame Apex is better
Hi
Very cool
Ty is too full of himself

E
Even though they dont upload a video as much as other youtubers, but when they do upload, it makes me smile :)
Everyone be like: Yeeee a new dude perfect video
Ah yes 69k likes
3:08 Me going up for an aerial
Just me, deciding maybe I'll buy 12 RC boats instead of a real one, with gas prices the way they are...
6:10 Do I sense Jacksepticeye??/
3:48 i was so confused on whether or not it was a real car
Remember watching u like 10 yrs ago ! Never give up ! Content is still fire
*wakesurf
Should of had Tyler win another game of fortnite with ninja
Just a banger.
Hmm most of the rc stunts are already been done before...
plz make a race with rc cars
Dude perfect
Cant wait for other videos
It’s Ironic that this is the last day of chapter 3 season 2
Do a video of a dead corse for rc cars
I love how this was trick shots and not trick shots at the same time
At 2:45 it makes a rainbow thats crazy
Awesome so cool
This is on trending! Whoooooh!!
I love this great video👍👍👏👏
GTA trickshots in real life
I thought my AirPods were low on battery when he parked the RC 4:18
Very coooooooooooool!!!!!
Ehhhh let’s go best trick shots
Another banger of a video great job
“Across the water, into the ring of fire”. That should be the NEW Lord of the Rings quotation, any character you think suits the character’s way of saying.
Comment
5:25 how was that first try?
Done
I can just imagine a person fishing and sees a another person just getting pulled by tv boats across the lake, hilarious but awesome trick
whp needs an rc boat when you have an rc car
You should do golf trick shots.
This is epic
ngl you could try foiling behind the rc boats. Uses and needs a lot less power
AMAZING!!!!
believe Jesus died on the Cross and rose 3 days later for ur sins spread the gospel repent from ur sins take Jesus Christ as ur Lord and Savior!
Is that a Supraaaaaaaaa
I’m surprised this hasn’t been a Mr. Beast video already haha
imagine playing fortnight in 2022
yo where can i find that rc monster truck
My whole family love dude perfect
They have put the best music in this video until now i mean it's the best song out of all their videos
Next let’s see those rc cars pull him out of the water
Can I get rc please
I was here at minute two
legend
Did this video come out late? Because no builds has been here for a few months now, and we're headed to a new season tomorrow
0:47 the stunt would have been insane if Coby built the loopty loop
Are y’all getting your own fortnite skins
Crazy guys :O
Absolutely amazing the trick shots were amazing the only thing is coby wakesurfed not wakeboard
I love the stunts
🔥🤩
hey did u guys notice the rc car when it was on the water it made a rainbow for some seconds
Love these guys, been watching them for years know
🔝🔝
How many rc cars/boats did you break
Bring RC cars more video, love it 👍
Amazing video! But umm…why was this not sponsored by Rocket League? Owned by EPIC GAMES 😂
Their content is actually amazing 👏
That's not a wakeboard, it a wake surfboard.
I love it when they add in their own build at the end, cause it’s like the main attraction of the vid
Coby laugh is everything lol
Imagine them doing these stunts with real cars
Does it bother anyone else that they don't know the difference between a wakeboard and a waskesurf board?🤷🏻‍♂️
Amazing trick shots. I love how sometimes when they land the trick shots, they don't shout yeahhhh, instead they make it look like they do it in their sleep.
ur mom
Yo sick vid bro
Wakesurfing u mean
Do y'all think Dude Perfect are physics experts as they calculate such precise trick shots?
Would love to see a video of just the process and steps to get wake boarding to work
Wow!!!! That's amazing!!! You guys are unbelievable! I can't wait for OT 34! I'm hoping for another get crafty and some cool not cool! Or commercial clash. or Hack attack!!!
Want RC cars next part video, that video was awesome watched many times.
Each video inspires me. You guys are complete ledgends😎. Thank
For the record that was a wake surf board, not a wake board but still cool tho
I haven’t watched tiko in a while. glad I came back
Pretty sure that’s wakesurfing😂
Dude boys....no matter what always say....1st try!
Best DP video in a long time
wow there is a sign behind the rc
Insane nice video😃
.
No hate, but that wasn't a wakeboard. It was a wake surf board.
I loved it but I think you were wake surfing not wake boarding because theyre was no boot thing.
Tbh it’s easier to wakeboard with a wakeboard not a surf board
them just casually crashing 500 dollar rc cars
You all never disappoint us, really one of the best channel in youtube

Play fortnite pls
is that a supra
dude perfect
That is unbelievable . what a video
HEY I ALWAYS TRY TO COMMENT FIRST PLS LIKE THIS COMMENT DUDE PERFECT !
That was so cool
My mouth is literally tearing because I am laughing so much right now
O boy :( disappointed by this video.  A for effort and excitement you bro's always bring that, who doesn't wanna play with remote control cars?. . . no one.  But the tricks I didn't think were impressive, and it felt a little superficial.
It’s ironic that today is the live event of the e season that introduced zero builds and the very last day of the season
I love your videos
So dope!!!!!
My favorite trick shot would absolutely be the rc wait boarding one that was awesome and should be a world record!!!
ya'll are so cool you always make me lol
3:00 Rocket League
Yo is that a SUPRA 😂
so cool🤩
Mark rober OT was 👏 amazing 👏
Can’t wait for the next bucket list, always feels like watching an amazing documentary 🧡🧡
That was great! Keep it up DP!
Supraaaaaaaaa
👍
Efforts for bucket 🪣 list are amazing 👏
Rc rocket legaue 😮
I’m surprised they haven’t tried to do trick shots on zip lines yet
Is it RC trick shots, or RC stunts? Just kidding- Its a banger of a video with every kind of awesomeness! Keep it up DP!
The dedication for this video is remarkable. Just mind blowing from the dudes.
Extremely smart guys
Another banger as usual!
Love this concept 👏
Atleast we can dream how youtubers live
Great vid but also hilarious that they said Fortnite JUST launched no build (aka 2.5-3 months ago) lol
Dp we need your individual indepth house tour
I don't know how the youtube algorithm doesn't recommend these videos to me, guys, you're great
Do another fishing challenge
the rc car driving on water actually made a rainbow lol 2:45
Umm... there’s a massive event happening in fortnite. I hope you’re aware of this.  Btw nice trick shots!
It’s been a hot minute, but no rc planes?
❤️❤️ awwessomme ❤️❤️
Why'd you guys stop the Plus Bus (DP+ BTS)? It was super fun.
Your guys’s vids are amazing
You guys are doing the impossible just like Dallas 77 LD😉👌
Rocket League vibes.
If not sponsored by traxxas, it must have been hella expensive. 1xmaxx 1500, sledge 1000, spartain 500..
About 1 hr later we will have the event down time and a new season and no more zero build potentially
Awesome and insane
The supra
Rocket league be like:
This was amazing keep working and making great videos
I felt bad for Tyler
I hope to however sees this comment has a great day!!!😀🙂😃
Are you serious man 😃 wowow just wow
2:46 it created a rainbow
That's wake surfing, not wakeboarding
Hi I love you guys! 😍
The RC wakeboarding was badass!!
Best RC trick shots yet
Well done, just absolutely awesome
Notice the rainbow behind the RC when they did the quarter mile water cross
Film video with DALLMYD.
love the rocket league shot haha😂
3:08  "THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!" -Shogen
Stupendous
You guys are incredible how do you even do those trick shots
At first I was wondering, “How much money in RC cars did you put into this video?” And then I saw at the end that it was sponsored by Traxxas 😂
Bro I love dude perfect and all, but this was kinda lame😕
It would be cool if there were a food themed trickshots
So awesome to finally see another video! Awesome!!!!!
Love the car transition that is sick!
Crazy
8:25 Unbalieva-
THEY BROUGHT BACK POUND IT NOGGIN'!!! sort of 😂
We want over time
1:05 that angle of camera was so smooth you won't believe that there is circle.
buying a RC car is my dream 😌😍
I find it hilarious that the Fortnite event is today
awesome
Too bad you spoiled this epic video of traxxas Rc cars with a sponsor FROM F*ING F***NITE!!!
Can we get a 30 minute video of attempts? With a counter of how many times it takes
You changed the title and thumbnail
This is what dude perfect means 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,this video is lit
That was so cool, thank you guys so much!
was it just me or was this edited much worse
3:05 Rocket league irl, great vid👍
i like how its the end of the fortnite zero build season
i love you dude perfect
1:03 "Fuq it"
I love how much effort y’all put into these videos
Request for new video is people at camp stereotypes
I hope cody falls asleep and never wakes up again
But that is wake surfing...
I love your videos can you shout out Daniel thanks love you
cool
The real question is how many rcs have you broken?
That was great
Dgssttsrfsrsyrssursstutddrtrrww we wqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
I hope one of you has your part 107. For these awesome drone shots!
why are they advertising zero build, noone likes it
Only early people remember when it was called "I Wakeboarded Behind RC Boats" and had a different thumbnail
rc header should of been called rocket league in real life
Funny thing is next Fortnite season starts tomorrow
So the Loop de loop doesn’t go to waste y’all should include it in a rc video like hotwheels racing
FIRST TRYY FIRST TRYY!!! More like Batman’s first try from the Lego movie
that was really cool. Love the boat wake boarding.
Cool
Me watching this video      My brain: this must have took a long time to do this because they said these tricks were impossible
This is by far the coolest RC video ever !!!
I like your all videos. You guys are really great. Love you dudes.🥰🥰🥰
the time and effort you guys put into making these videos is unbelievable. i’m always sad when the videos are over.   please tell me that there’s a dp+ video to this😭😭
I'm gonna stop watching when I see a tube of KY and various sized fruits...just sayin
Great runs, when you don't have to worry about the death rate (except possibly with Coby).
r/fuckepicgames
2:46 anybody else saw the rainbow forming behind the truck
this is my comment: that is awesome
Hi dude perfect you guys should do a comments shout out every video
Never disappointed
Like the supra.  RC version was cool, I want one
hold up did that CAR JUST DRIVE ON WATER?! someone explain!! 2:40
That hydroplane was INSANE
Love you guys I couldn’t wait when I found out you were making this on Instagram
The other thumbnail was better
The soccer trick shot was basically rocket league!
I love your videos
So cool i love dude perfect
Nice
they just find perfect songs for the videos it’s crazy
the rc header is basically rocket league
6:09 Top of the Morning Me: Now where have I heard that before
I love it
Commented
I love how he says Fortnite is going bonkers but all Fortnite streamers and content creators have had a 50 percent decrease in viewers
🇦🇫💯🇺🇲
3:00 this is rocket league
Can i be honest, as much as i love watching these kinds of videos i miss when you guys did mainly sports content. Now it’s kinda just a bunch of basic kids content that everyone else is making and then occasionally doing a sports video. maybe that’s just me
This looks dangerous,   Let’s DO THIS!
So cool
Hiiii
Just 💯❤️✨🔥
So early that the thumbnail changes
5:09 evil laugh
Toyota supranational let’s gooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
Another sick video
I’m not hating but i fell like Cory cursed
It's aaa it'sss aaaaa it's aaaaasa IT'S A SUPRAAAAAA!! 🤯🤯✨
RC car stunts are just awesome just like other Dude Perfect videos..... but the RC wakeboard one is something else
1 word :   Cool.
E
Awesome
For Dude Perfect … impossible is nothing 🔥🔥 absolute scorcher of trick shots 👌🏼
U
What a coincidence. I’ve RC wake boarded behind a real boat!
Hi
5:12 rocket league
how would zero build just drop when it was introduced a few months ago plus today is the last day of the current battle pass
INSANE!!!
Thank for more awesome vids i love to see them
That looked like some crazy I wakeboard to me
I love your trick shots! I love the energy of you guys too!
Cory: 63 pounds that's wild! the song: uh-huh
Only dude perfect would be crazy enough to do this
Dude Perfect has impacted my life in many ways!
3:10 Rocket league irl 🤣
I recommend you all see it on a tv or something, this video is a whole experience.
i have  arrived at the comments as per tys request after the ring of fire trick shot
best vid ever
You should do school stereotype
What happened to overtime?
عبدالله
The thumbnail changed😂
please keep making video's love you guys
The 5 trick shot was just rocket league rl
Did u guys use a traxxas slasher 2wd at all I liked it my dad loves rc I’m gonna show him this video tomorrow

Your ideas are literally very creative 🔥
"that was unbelieva..."
Cody you bafoon! I hate this Chanel with an actual passion it makes me so angry how much this Chanel appeals to 6 year olds and YouTube
Can’t wait for overtime!!

Safest way to wakeboard

Shouting “first try” after showing us three misses... RC content was great!
3:00 Alternate Title - Rocket League Header
I wonder how many RC cars they bought and how many broke
ab for smooth landing
Yo Dude Perfect can I have one RC car plz I can’t get one in my area Btw epic video
I know it sounds dangerous but Paragliding with drones or rc planes would be pretty cool, obviously with safety features, but flying with flying planes would top this one in the future, awesome work with the rc boats
The RC header was like a pure moments from Rocket League
I just got into rc cars, i love them and i also have a boat, they are super fun, i want a xmaxx now 😂
Rocket league be like
Traxxas cars and everything are amazing! I have the Rustler 4x4 vxl
No build is THE BEST game mode
It's always brings joy while watching new dude perfect video
It was smart to merge the sponsor with bloopers so most viewers wouldn't skip
can't wait for upcoming videos!!!!!
"Fortnite just droped Zero Build and it's here to stay". Me getting ready for live event for the end of the ch3 s2
Feels so weird without a outro

Loved this video! Amazing builds! Amazing editing! Praying for you all!
i love watching these, your pretty much carrying the whole “trick shots” era
I got u
my mind is thinking the funk bros and dude perfect need to do a colab
Nice video!! This took a long time to film
Rc's can do anything!
The quarter mile was the best one 👍👍👍
When is OT34?
Imagine being a boat bought by dude perfect
So cool
You guys are so crazy I LOVE you you are the best you tuber ever
i like how the dudes sponsor is epic games' fortnite zero builds, and the season ends today
What an epic video
FORGET THIS WE NEED OVERTIME ITS BEEN TO LONG!!!
These guys are just awsome hats off guys
Very cool
"That was unbelieva-"
Still amazing after all these years!
Dp is goat
Sheesh
2:46 beautiful rainbow
WOW guys! You really bring something new with each video! U can see all the hard work that was put into the making of this video
Who remembers the other RC video from years ago? This video brought be nostalgia
Great video
Whenever dude perfect uploads a new video it makes your day!
ماكو عرب 😕
Look at these Rocket League goals 😂
yayyyyy
Outstanding video guys! Y’all are the best can’t wait for new videos ! Pound it Noggin 😎
Yeahhh
thats not a wake board. Its a skim Board.
3:11 rocket league??
Beans
Enjoy watching the trick shot perform by ua all
Insane, keep it up
30mins in
sheesh
The edits are always so clean. Props to the editors and DP!!!
This is a comment
Do you guys ever say anything without yelling?  Sorry, can't listen to all that noise!
I seriously wonder how many parts they broke during this😂
This video was absolutely insane!! Y’all are awesome!
I was gonna say its been 10 episodes since the last overtime
You…. I…. Can’t put into words how cool you guys are thank you
Dude perfects standard is really getting low
This was crazy cool!!
Technically he wakeskated behind RC cars not wakeboarded
Are you guys at typhoon Texas in the vid? Because I have one 2 min away from me and it looks you guys are. 😊
Bro I love zero build-solos or duos in Fortnite. I also found out how to get it on mobile. (Apple)
y’all guys are cracee
3:00,   Now we know how Rocket League was made
Yall should do sports stereotypes for next video
3:50 nice bmw
Wakeboarding trick shots?!?!?
Just one word, COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLL 👍👍👍👍👍👍
I seriously didn't know whether this was a trickshot video or battle from the title.
Always a great day when DP posts
yes
Can we get obserd records back
I loved the video congrats but please never sponsor fornite again just please never again
Hi hi hello
With all due respect. Your last 2 stereotype videos haven’t been the best. There’s too many none dp characters and weird gimmicks that don’t make sense or just look dumb. Other than that amazing videos.
I was so sad when the video ended I love what y’all do
Show the bloops of the drift car on ot 35 also can’t wait for the next fight seen  Edit: I got tickets to the happy summer tour
ayyy
1st view
Aw yes, fort nite no builds”JUST” dropped
Love u cobes!💜💯
FORTNITE
Fortnite with cero build, that is crazy 🤣🤣
I play zerobuild all the time
at 2:44 the rc car made a rainbow
The one looked like rocket league
Love these guys. They never seize to amaze me. I just have to do one tiny correction. What they did behind the boat is skurfing. Wakeboarding you are in bindings on a wakeboard. Either way it is still beyond impressive and I love these guises content.
never thought dude perfect have to ask for subs
They made a rocket league trick shot irl lol
Rất hay 😁💪
THATS A SURF BOARD NOT A WAKE BOARD
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I dont speak english tapi saya suka ini
To be honest I don’t know why more people don’t subscribe. To be honest I like this channel better than Mr beasts cause y’all do cool stunts break world records while making it entertaining. I respect that.
Im a simple man , I see RC i Like
I am a second twin boy too love cory
This really should go Viral. this beats Mrbeast
fortnite just dropped zero builds *me who has been playing zero builds for 2 months*😑
By far the only channel who would go as far as to take rc boats, mend them and use it to wakeboard.
you guys are legends
One of their best videos by far!!!
Is this a challenge or trick shots
wow
Purple Hozier!!!!
The laugh tho 5:10
🙂😄🙃😉😃😊
I looove your videos, can’t wait for ANY new videos!😊
Anyone curious why Ty had huge black gloves on lol 😂
I wana know who builds all their ramps
3:00 - "THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE"
Don't Miss Dude Gaming (Sparky). Dude Perfect
That was sick
Today there will be a new season
That is insane
Bro is playing rocket league
Dp getting sponsored by Fortnite although its ending in a couple hours
Taking away nothing from wake boarding behind RC Boats... The quarter mile hydroplane was insane as well...
AMAZING😎👍💙
Awesome stuff great video way to go guys well done. Also i wana know is that car that fell from the roof the same that did the jump if so where did you get so strong rc cars from :D
THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE
Love your videos
Early
This was so sick
So sick!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Very nice cool and smooth
Wow
Amazing 😍 videos
Do the twins know how to clear their throats
They impressed us with the best moments and miracles as usual.
🇱🇰   I am sri lanka people  . But I like your  all videos.   🇱🇰         😭💔  Get will soon sri lanka  💔😭
Man I miss my X-Maxx... I wish I didn't sell it...
Cody: Let’s go play some Fortnite
3:15 rocket league  IRL
the water and fire one was coolest, maybe the best visually that they've ever done
Overtime top 10 sports players
7:27 is he really crying 😂💀
Once you finish using a prop like the hoop for a video, where does it go? Do you throw it away or save it for a different video?
Epic!
So basically just Rocket League irl??!
Love you guys you’re the best
Idk how you guys are so entertaining I’ve watched you since I was little and still love every vid
What?????!!!!!
Wait if they have been sponsored by epic games over 2 time sides that mean we are getting them in Fortnite, imagine there own custom trick shot emote
Any Indian DP fans like here
Great video!
Should’ve gotten sponsored by traxxis
This is awesome! Nicely done!
The 5 no stunt was like a goal in the game rocket league with header
Awesome!
🔥💛🔥💛🔥💛💛💛💛🔥💛🔥💛🔥💛🔥💛
I’d be interested in knowing what Traxxas vehicles were used for each of the stunts as well as what damage was done to them in the process. Perhaps a follow up video so we could see just how tough they are as well as how repairable they are.
Hi 👋
Eu queria um carrinho desse :(
Crazy that I just watched Dude Perfect play rocket league in real life
when the car crossed the water that was sooo cool
4:07 how parking should be done
For the ones who reads this just know this is only the beginning keep pushing, grinding, and fighting. Whatever it is in life you want to do to go after it life is to short. Life is a marathon not a sprint so go out there and live it up I hope all is well and goes well for you peace and one love! ✌🏽🙏🏽
One of the best videos
Algocommi 🍀👍🍀
You guys need to go back to 4 videos a month there's never enough of hou guys to watch
I love your videos so much TY and the rest of dp can you pretty please with a cherry on top shout me out
What do you mean just dropped? It has been a thing for months and it might be about to end as I am making this comment.
Which dude is worthy to hold mjonir
Were did you get the rc boats because I really want a high speed rc boat
I think they have to redo the wakeboarding, that was a surfboard lol
Lets f*cking do this!!
Hi
"That was unbelieva-"
Hello hello hello
Love it
Yes let’s go boys!!!!
3:13 POV: Rocket league
wooooooooo
It’s my birthday 🥳
You always put so much effort into these, you guys probably broke a lot of rc stuff just for our happiness!
Rocket league should have been the sponsor
🤑
Yall allwaise deserve a like . Its not like you didn’t pit effort in the vid.
Ty- Subscribe, like, comment.. My hand- it happens everytime Dude ❤️👉
Sick idea boys
You rock
How does dude perfect always find the best songs for their videos?
"Just dropped zero build"  Literally 3 months ago, in a few hours is s3c3
what kinda of glasses are those on cody?? i want some!
"We have surprise" and wrote it in the title xD
@Dude Perfect is the next Bucket List video in Qatar?
I'm pretty sure that isn't a wakeboard 😂😂 normally wakeboards strap to your feet but still really impressive and very enjoyable video!!
Whenever dude perfect makes a video my day becomes 300x better
3:08 Reminds me of rocket league XD ⚽️💥🚗
Just going to say a Fortnite steortype just saying
What happened too ot???????
How’s the wkaeboarding
So cool to see Epic Games sponsor you! Zero builds is very fun. Great video as always!!!
Amazing Video! Keep it up!
This probably took months to perfect. Great job, appreciate the grinding!
Absolutely Amazing
Love your videos
3:08 THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE
dude perfect males the best trick shots never disappoint
6:52 wasnt that close same trick is being used in the top gun movies ;)
Yooooo upload on my bday? Awsome!
These trick shots were next level. You guys are awesome
Have you ever tried a battle episode where you play RC rocket league?
hello
Can I just ask how are they so crazy talented?
They should do sinking boat steriotipes
i think its a bit cheap to stick content in the middle of the add... adds are adds, content is content
Wow
1 hour squad?
Dude perfect just make my Saturday
this video was absolutely insane. well done
5:07   That laugh... I am dead XD
Always saves best for the last
Love dude perfect coming to see u July 8  2022 Wisconsin!!!!
Wowowowowowowoow
coby actually got his clothes wet which actually added some weight... that could have been avoided... amazing video btw
That was a surfboard not a wakeboard
Ima comment just cuz Tyler told me to :3
4:39  Cody should have bought the RC controller that went up to 11....  Because sometimes you need just that little bit extra.
7 year old me thinking I could do these😂😂😂👏
That's not wakeboarding...
This will look pretty fun to do
i dont know whats more creative the trick shots or the names lol
nice video keep it up
So cool man 💜
🔥
school stereotypes
This Video is amazing
Yes they did another video
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how long the dudes spend on their videos? each of their trick shots (20 seconds of footage) takes hours to get, but they do many many trick shots. Not to mention editing, organizing, finding, eat. Thank you for these videos, they make my day!!!!!
Our old dudeprefect  are back💙🖤
that was really unbelivab like he said :)
Hi ty I am team ty
Fav since childhood 🎉♥️♥️♥️
Bro it was rocket league in real life
LETS GOOOOOO
Funny that the sponsor is epic games and Fortnite has a live event today
DP are just doing better and better
Gi
I am so excited for OT 34 Rocket Battle 3 and especially bucket list 🌎 I have seen all of your videos even the ones on Hulu also I am going to Pennsylvania to watch you guys and I hope you like my comment 😁😜😊
I'm very impressed.  Next challenge: beard battle.  Which of the dudes can break one of my beard world records?
I just thought this was an overtime but heck this was much crazier!
Yo guyz that wakeboarding was lit!!!🔥🔥🔥
Yea
🔥💕👌👍
The content they create is just incredible. ❤ u guys
I can't believe it! You guys managed to do the impossible once again! congrats😜
Not gone lie. Love yall but not one of your more entertaining videos to say the least.
That ain’t wakeboarding that’s surfing
1st Guy to Wakeboard with RC boats THAT'S GOTTA BE A WORLD RECORD
Timmy
You guys should do a full wakeboarding video
5:10 that laugh 😂😂🤣
Wow this video is awesome. 👌
Well done for the wake boarding with rc boat that was amazing thx dp your amazing keep up the hard work

The drone shots are on point!
Bad title for this great video
7:20 that random lady walking in the backround has probably no idea what’s going on!
That's a nice a90 supra
Do a Washington DC bucket list
YES another rocket battle!
Fortnite and Rc cars have so much in common
Props to Coby and the team for that very insane wakeboarding stunts! Very cool! 👊
at 6:50 theres a weird voices in the background
Ok idc if it’s less professional but we need more that 8 minutes every 2 weeks
I love the vids
I liked, commented, shared, and I already subbed in 2020
Zero build came out long time ago
02:44 did anyone notice the rainbow behind the RC in water 😍😍😅
Such a cool video guys! Never fail to disappoint and always entertain us! Keep it up guys, y’all are awesome!
Epic

4:34 they didn't even realized they released this the day of the live event :D
RC stunts !
I could never do this.
Yall forget what "impossible" means? If you're attempting 10 impossible shots than you should be able to successfully DO 10 trick shots... 57 million dubs and yall are still asking for likes and subs? This channel is definitely over.
Yaaay
3:08 that’s like rocket league🤘
I’m glad Ty is still there.
Hheheheheh
Not gonna lie the RC boat wakeboarding looks hilarious
hi love your vids
Nice shot ty

The amount of money Dp went through in rc cars and parts was immense. Props to you guys
This is so cool
I know what an all nighter feels like Cody, must’ve been hard
great jump through the  fire!
I love this
Next video idea “I flew only using rc planes”
This is how you know someone has made it far. Being sponsored by epic games! Keep up the great work! DP never disappoints us. 👍👍
3:08 I love this shot mainly because there is a game called rocket league and it’s basically the same as the shot just without the gong. ALSO LPVE YALLS VIDS KEEP IT UP!!
only dude perfect
You guys brought Fast and Furious to life.
Y’all should do wiffle ball trick shots
dude yall where making rocket league shots why get sponsured by fortnite when yall can get sponsured by rocket league and the ticits of the world championship

Bruh fortnite zero build came out like a month ago.
That was actually a surfboard for when you surf behind boats not a wakeboard
You and Ryan Trahan both uploaded today at the exact same time, 10 o’clock haha

This is beyond impressive
Next videos are gonna be EXPENSIVE if they need Madden and Fortnite to sponsor them
The next 3 videos will be the most epic thing in dude perfect history
Look for the rainbow at 2:46

I wonder how long it took to master this
You should do a RC water trick shots
I mean mythbusters managed to water ski behind a row boat so.
Can you just calm down ... your incessant screaming and shouting is somewhat over the top ... but then again you are Americans. I guess you just can't help yourselves !
Yeez one of those cars really costs $500
I want more ot’s
congrats to everyone who found this comment u r a true fan if u did!
I know all these stunts are super hard to do. But this is "Dude Perfect" after. Glad to see back to your home roots again. (p.s. I'm 60 yrs old)/Young) Thanks for the fun.

Dude is perfect!
You guys never fail to impress. How many cars did y’all go through in the making?😂 I have a Traxxas I’ve put threw so much myself but this is next level.
Traxxas Xmaxx & sledge = Great combination of bashing stunt vehicles. If anybody owns an Xmaxx be very proud that you have one!! Lets Go!!! 👍❤️
“Congratulations To Everyone who is Early and Found this Comment!” 🏆

You know you’re legit when epic games is sponsoring you. Been wit ya since forever! Love you DP!
Can we just appreciate how much effort and time they put into the making of these videos just for us?
2:30 you guys really should make just this a challenge. How far can you ride an rc car across water?
You guys are amazing I love what you do.
2:45 The rainbow 😍😍

B  F G  G G G G  G T
Day 15 of asking them to do a water sports video Edit: they also were using a wake surf board not a wakeboard because wakeboards have boots that strap you in
That wake surfing not wake borading but it was insane
1:02  One of the twins said F**K You/it!😨 I though that they were family friendly🫣
Hello
CHECK MY TRICK SHOTS PLS
Don't think I've ever been this early for a Dude Perfect video before, and now that I've finally finished watching, I remember why these videos are so awesome. Perfect one to come back to: that rc boat wakeboarding was probably the greatest feat you guys have pulled. :D 🔥🔥🔥👌🚤🚤🚤🚤🚤🏄‍♂🌊🌊
Definitely did not expect that title tho
Yes! You're the lucky one out there Come to see more ✌️
Thanks for watching!! 👊🏼🙇🏻‍♂️ NEXT VIDEOS 📺 Overtime 34 🚀 Rocket Battle 3 🌎 Bucket List

At 3:46 … iS tHat a sUPrA!?!

You should do the world record for longest wakeboarded behind a boat
The RC creating mini rainbow when racing across the water was magical!
Incredible you guys make the impossible possible
Yezzir
The Supra was so cool
Wow this is so creative and probably took slot of hard work
Dude perfect Yall are amazing keep up the work. also when is your next overtime coming out?

I love DUDE PERFECT ❤❤❤❤
They put so much effort into these videos for us all!
The lyrics of the song perfectly portrayed the buildup and perseverance the dudes went through to pull the RC Boat Wakeboarding stunt. That was *sick!!*
I had wakeboarded behind a boat but I was very surprised that Coby was able to wakeboard behind RC boats!🤘🏻
I'll take one of the broken cars
How much feul do they use for these videos with all the drivin they are doing
20 min!!!!
Early
I'm glad the last stunt was done by coby couldn't have been better.
Zero build has been here for two months what
Man driving no the Jesus mobile

fortnite zero build has been out for at least a month
Hi Dude Perfect, How Are You Guys Doing?

I'm surprised that there was a rainbow when Tyler's car crosses a quarter mile in 2:47
They just never fail to come through with banger content.
5:09 coby's laughter was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely outstanding! 🏎 🔥
how many rc cars did you go through?
Duck

This is one of the most impressive trick shots I've ever seen. I love your content and the bloopers are hilarious. I like how when it was his like0 4th try he said "First try baby! First try!" Keep posting!
To header is literally rocket league
Really cool! Love RC toys!
These are unbelievable trick shorts
Zero build came out a month ago and that’s when this video was filmed. That shows the amount of time put into these videos. Crazy!
Made me think of MythBusters water skiing behind a rowing team
