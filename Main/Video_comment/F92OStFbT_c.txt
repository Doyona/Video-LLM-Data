This aged well
As a Packers fan : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA RAIDERS SUCK
Ur an owner.  Ur paying this guy. Or kylar Murray?   Professional Appearance. Professional Demeanor.  ALL IN.
Gentlemen
You made a great choice Davonte.
I agree and you are Legend boss
Davonte you the stuff boss
Great receiver
Great job on the new born Davonte . And you are a good father smooth to.
Great wide receiver Davonte Adams.😃
Still cant believe it man 😢 its a dream come true we dont get much off field Ws so this is nice 😊
Can the season just start already? 🤣
The Raiders will suck again and always lol nothing different from last year or all the years prior to that lol Adams got a 💰 and the Raiders are a ATM 🏧
Looks like I'm keeping up with the raiders this year Adams is my favorite player.... Good luck Davante,  But go Pack go... Packers vs Raiders Superbowl
Packer fan here - Listen to him, this man BUILT different. Cerebral, craftsman and the footwork is pure art. Work ethic is unpararelled. Raider fans may not all know this, but most people thought hed be cut after a tough season full of drops etc about 7 years ago. Yeah. Thats the work ethic right there
That sucks now that davantae in the raiders Arron rodgers would always dime him
My favorite team is the packers but now he in the raiders damn
He can literally lead the Raiders and win TANK BOWLS. Raiders will take #1 draft pick next year😁
You wanna talk about high character! Football aside, seems like a good human being
He's brought some different atmosphere into the kind of gloomy black and silver.  🌸 🌸 🌸  I have been watching his play. Finally, he's detached from the QB. 😌
TEARS OF JOY!!! And awesome awesome interview and responses! Love you Adams Family "EPA ROYALTY" SMILE
He will get injured for sure and miss at least 3 games this year, his health is on a decline hasnt completed a full season in 5 years , Derek Carr will over use him and cause him to get injured.
“Mr.Brown, I should say”. I love this man🏴‍☠️💯
You will be missed Mr Adams! Thank you for all of your hard work! Now go get that ring! GoPackGo!
It felt good seeing him in person but i hate he's leaving green bay
WELCOME TO THE ONE AND ONLY TRUE NATION. ONCE A RAIDER ALWAYS A RAIDER.                    !!!!JUST WIN BABY!!!!
As a charger fan our division is stacked.may the best team win
Heres to GB for sticking with 17 after an abysmal 2nd season and helping mold him into the man he is.
What a class act!
He's wearing all black bc it's the death of his career.
You just tell by the way he responds that he’s a highly intelligent and deep person. He’s extremely thoughtful with his answers and very fluid in his speech and information processing.
JUDAS!!!
Congrats Davante. You earned it all
Boring garbage
LOL We all know what this organization does to the Best WR Free Agents. Remember this team damn near ended Randy Moss’s career? I feel terrible for Davante. He’s In football purgatory now
He sounds so refreshing and genuine. I hope he has a long career in Vegas. Raiddddddeeeeerrrrrsssss
Hope hunter shows adams the tripple move
He will be missed. Great player & human being. Best of luck, unless u play GB
It's a dream for Raider Nation as well
all i gotta say how fuckn PROFESSIONAL...... DAVANTE ADAMS ALL I COULD THINK OF WATCHING THIS INTERVIEW IS HOW PROFESSIONAL YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF ..
Make the RAideRRRsss Great again !! 💪🏴‍☠️💯
So proud of my org as i just finished watching the browns with d watson. This guy is not only a baller, but a really smart and honourable dude. Cant wait for him to be with his family at some games
I haven't been this happy since the warriors signed Durant
He and Derek 'ARE' like '2' Peas in a Pod. Very Down to Earth. It'll be a pleasure to see them on the field communicating w/each other come 'Game time'....... RRRRRRRRRAAAAAIIIIDAHHHHHHHS!!!!!
Another baby on the way... coming from someone who'll make more that the rest of us ever. But get that money man
He is talking about Renfrow... who is the same age as my oldest son, Aldo... Aldo was a great wide receiver in high school, just didn't get the good back up coaching, but   So damn proud of Aldo and Hunter.
GO BACK TO GREEN BAY PACKERS NOW IM 😢😭😭😭😭😢😢😛😭😭😭😭
He seems really humble and passionate about being a raider. He will make us a team to be feared. JUST WIN BABY!!! RN4L
I love this guy. True professional
Truly a Pro's Pro . Well deserved
Lol bro carr is garbage! That’s the problem
DA is the real deal!
Randy moss 👎👎👎👎
Weare blessed to have Adams! A family man, humble, God-fearing man, much much applauded by Raiders staff for getting him in the silver&black!
I love how he speaks 2 motivation and Legacy
👑
Not even really a raiders fan but now is the time to see how good Derek is. Good luck to Davante and the Raiders
Man, other than his obvious talent, Devate is a class act. Ideal teammate.  Hopin the Raiders take it this year.
🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏆
Best receiver in the game
I’ll miss Tae in GB so much. But I’m happy for him. I knew he would be great from day 1 as a Packer.
The best part about this signing is that, Davante is a Raider. He is a member of the nation! Such a humble and distinguished player. Real Tim Brown or Charles Woodson vibes. Absolute beast but down to earth and most importantly a Raider.
Davante Adams is my favorite receiver in the game. So much heart. Wishing him all the success in LV.
Adams is pure class. As a Packers fan, this was hard to watch, but I am happy for him. He wanted a change of scenery, and the Packers got some premium picks + $20M in cap space. Adams is an extremely intelligent player. I always learned something new listening to his press conferences. I remember one time he said he doesn't jaw or talk trash too much with CBs because 1) he needs to get back to the huddle for the next play and 2) it's a distraction. Notice that CBs don't talk too much trash to him anyway cuz they know what's coming next. Best of luck Davante!
I think this move makes us more competitive than everyone thinks. I honestly think we can make a really deep playoff push now
No more excuses for DC. We have his BFF on the team now. If he bombs this upcoming season, we're trading for Baker Mayfield.
That guy sounds like he don't miss a minute of green bay lol 😂
I realized how special he is going to be for the Raiders when he said Renfrow might be able to teach him things!! Talk about a guy with NO Ego!! Love This!! He said that he doesn't want Derek to force him the ball. How Smart is this guy? Loving him even more!!
Life long Packer fan here...Super appreciative for your years spent with our team...best wishes with the Raiders
As a Chargers fan I hate to say this but congratulations on getting this tremendously talented receiver & terrific guy on your team. Looking forward to the coming battles!
Lawd! Bay Area boy here and I’m literally in Awe! This will go down as one of the most important acquisitions in Raider history! DVP is one of the most articulate, humble, and capable players we have ever gotten. It was written….EPA done come back as the prodigal. I could not be more proud to have this kid represent us!!!!! Bless you kid!! Finally…….as I say every year….we’re going to the Ship? This year may peer into our future.
When this trade happened I felt so emotional because I knew that there will be hope for us to win a Super Bowl with Davante Adams and it was a dream come true for Raider Nation and Derek I just hope Josh McDaniels uses him wisely and doesn’t take this trade for granted and this is probably the biggest trade by far we’ve made in a decade, but with that said the future is bright.RN4L!!!
This guys is different. My boi.
Reloaded and ready to take the super bowl
Best interview hands down.. humility is a great quality!! Best of luck to you DA I can’t wait to see see you in the Silver and Black! RN4L
Listen I love the move and I think Adams was top 3 at the position a lot of it because of Rogers he really don’t have game breaking speed his longest TD catch in his career is only for 66 yard he’s awesome but let this play out he is not Jerry rice I love that we got him but let’s calm down a little bit focus on The Team we have games to win and we still need to build this team Adams is good but not the best anybody playing with Rodgers and is Top 10 will look like the number 1 WR he is Top Ten but still has work to do I love the pick up let’s move on now and build the Team
How long until she gets a DUI
Not a raider fan but i remember seeing them play at fresno state probably went to like 4 games their last year but really wishing them success wholeheartedly 🙏 go make that happen Carr and Adams! God bless
No more freebie double teams on Waller!!   Those days are over...Waller gonna be more deadly ...WATCH!!
Tax free states will draw all the top players when you have Democrats running wild on everyone's paychecks!!  🤣🤣🤣
RNFL
Ac going Be best duo
Will forever be a Packers Legend first
LETS GOOOO. Haven't had a receiver this good in 20+ years. Derek Carr Is also a way better qb now than he was in 2016. Look what he did with a hurt Waller and Zay jones And Hunter Renfrow as his top 2 targets last year. No shade to Renfrow, but you have to have a receiver who can win on the outside consistently in the nfl. We have the best volume receiver in the NFL.
As a Packers fan I’m truly hurt about this. 😥
Knowing, as much as any of us can that aren't in the households, Derek as a person, I am amazed and more excited at how good these men can be for our Silver and Black. Carr has been nothing but a complete professional and it is all beginning to come together. Hunter, Waller, Adams, Carr, Jacobs, Miller, Mullen, and Maxx are all complete men. They play a kids game, but treat it like the greatest dream ever offered to those looking to entertain the masses. I love how Mark has been building this team. He is truly Al 2.0 and that makes me smile as a fan since 1986.
knowing the track record of raiders WR's, this is gonna be a fun ride to watch and laugh at
This is dope. A players dream to play at home or close to home. And they are loading up..
Welcome home!... or close to home...Bell and Runnymede.......E.P.A....Ca.
Did he really say Rodgers is the greatest QB ever🤦‍♂️
An impressive young man. I liked that when they asked him if he used not being picked first as motivation and he replied he has other things to motivate him like his family, kids, etc.
SuperBowl bound
Was at a bar in Manchester,NH watching round one of March Madness when I heard you were coming to Raider Nation! While being a Raiders fan in New England has been tough! I can’t wait to see what you a Carr can do together. Just Win Baby!!!!
Maybe D can get in some felony acts
I realized how special he is going to be for the Raiders when he said Renfrow might be able to teach him things!! Talk about a guy with NO Ego!! Love This!! He said that he doesn't want Derek to force him the ball. How Smart is this guy? Loving him even more!!
Im so happy for this Man. He deserves it all. I love Davantes spirit. Great football player and is a great person. I wish him the most success and am happy he is apart of the Raider organization. Great job Raiders. We got a good one. This team is stacked from top to bottom. Looking forward to the season.
I was shocked by this move. I'll bet it works out great for he and Carr
GB helped C Wood get his ring , now the Raiders can return the favor.
Coming from a packer fan I wish D.A. the absolute best of luck!!!
We will miss you Tae. You will always have a home in Green Bay.
Sounds like the New Tim Brown.
A real professional, best of luck to him and Carr, wouldn't it be a nice thing to see them doing well :)
Y’all better take care of my boy 😞😭
I’m so freakin excited! Adam’s is by far one my favorite players, I’m excited to see what this season brings!
Why is it that whenever someone signs with the raiders suddenly it's their "childhood team" I mean if I signed I'd say the same thing but..
All you need to see is the love Packers fans give this young man even while leaving their team. That speaks volumes about Davante and is impact on a team and their fans. I've been a Raiders fan for 48 years and can't remember a time I was more optimistic about their future! I do hope the Packers get something with the compensation they got from us. Their fans are more than deserving! Welcome to Raider Nation Davante!
Thank you for the video! You have a very interesting channel! And I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, as well as relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet. I also created a channel that can draw attention to this, though so far little has been done ((( I am writing this comment just to wish you health and good mood. Rejoice and connect with a friend. And if you suddenly feel bad at heart, remember this comment Only forward! Looking forward to your next . Good luck!
Im just so excited for this my 5 year old son die hard raider fan says hes the goat mom we’re gonna be beast.
Keeping my eyes on #17 this year💪🏼
Gon Miss U bruh 🧀🤦🏿‍♂️
10:30 this didn't age well😅
This aint right :(
“For what does it benefit someone to gain the whole world and yet lose his life?” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭8:36‬ ‭CSB‬‬..
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
So you're saying with all the money you make....You couldn't fly your grandparents or family  to a game in Green bay?
Anyone elses D get hard thinking about how much better the offense is going to play?
““Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands all people everywhere to repent,” ‭‭Acts‬ ‭17:30‬ ‭CSB‬‬.
He looks like the red power ranger from spd!
I love my Raiders, and I literally shouted at work when the news broke that we were getting Tae. This offense is going to be lethal. But I have to thank Packers fans for not being salty to him or The Nation. He gave everything he had in GB.
Welcome to the Nation 🏴‍☠️
We got just the packers out there.....bucks won the championship my boy wtf the knights been doing
he has always  been a class act   he will fit in nicely  with the Raiders.
For those that dont know.... raider nation we didnt get a football player we got w great man to represent the silver and black
The Raiders!?  I guess he's all about the money.
Raider Nation!!
This guy reminds me so much of Tim Brown with his humble demeanor and his love for the Raiders.
Going to be carrs best receiver since Crabtree
This is the kind of star you want on your team.  No BS, no real drama.  Works hard and it shows
Class act. Great move! Can't wait to see the duo get back to ballin'.
Loving the positive energy in these comments.
Anyone notice he said all of California!
The Raiders also just grabbed Demarcus Robinson from the Chiefs. This Raiders' WR core is absolutely stacked
Feels good to finally have a true Raiders fanatic as our player! 👍🏼👍🏼
Should’ve been a raider his entire nfl career
Class act! Excited for the season ✊🏽🏴‍☠️
Ad a life-long Raider fan, since the L.A. days, Devantae is living our Raider nation dream. Wish him and his family all the best. Seems like a great person as well as a great player.
This man and Derek Carr bout to win us a Superbowl.
Welcome home
Derek, Davante, Waller Being protected by Richie (I hope) and Miller!  Man these Defenses we play are gonna be🥪 toast
Super bowl!!
I love how he’s family oriented. So well spoken. Getting up there is hard to converse so concisely, in front of people and cameras. It’s like an intense job interview. And FREAKING NAILED IT
Derek Carr and devante Adams will be the best duo in the league I don't care what anyone says,😄
This is gonna be a special year 🏴‍☠️
Thats A class act guy 👏🏼👏🏼🎬
Thanks Tae for the memories. Once a Packer forever a Packer. Hopefully my Gs will get a chance to destroy your raiders before you retire😂. One7 GB Legend. Go Pack Go!
Any fans who keeps mentioning Devante isn't a fan he's Davante. Bears fan here secretly following my favorite Fresno State players. Thank you for leaving the NFC North.
They still suck😂 won’t make the playoffs
He betrayed the pack so hard...
Packers fan here.  Thank you Davante!  Raider nation you got a real great dude, a cool cat and the best WR in the league.
Tim Brown 2.0 lets gooo RAIDERS!!!
@taeadams 🔥
dazz my boy !!
This guy means business
If Derek’s bugging you better get out there and take some throw’s Adam’s Let’s get it! 🏴‍☠️ JUST WIN BABY!!
Hopefully this isn't just Another pay day...
8:04 - Interesting he mentioned the Chargers and not the Chiefs.
Finally the kind of player this fan base and team has been dying to get on this team at wide receiver!! Amazingly talented extremely humble and smart him and Darren Waller together is going to be a nightmare for the rest of the league! Let’s do this I’m so excited to see this offense with Adams added to the mix he’s the true #1 receiver Derek has always needed.
Davante, you sir are a breath of fresh air  I believe he will help take us to the next level. As a member of Raider Nation, I'm so excited because we have been slowly improving, winning a couple games more than the previous year  So if this trend continues, we should make the playoffs again. This time around I hope we will go deeper into the playoffs  Like if you agree! comment if you agree or disagree
I love his attitude.  Wow. Reminds of some of the old players.
as much as i love davante he is not gonna have close to the production with derek carr as he had with arod
His character is off the charts.  All players should take notice what a true professional is. Great attitude,  humble,  grateful, and all about family.  That says a lot. Glad we have him.
DA RAIIIIDDDDAAAASSS 🏴‍☠️
Lol.  Glad you got your money bro but your numbers are about to drop big time.  Carr isn't Rodgers and he isn't dropping those sick back shoulder dimes.
We took Woodson. Yall got jordy and adams. A lil history with these 2 teams. Raiders r a team i really dont hate. Kinda liked the silver and black but ride with the Green and Gold.
And he's dressed for the occasion! Nice!
Hondo always has the best Q.
He said he wanted to join the raiders and it's his child hood dream but the media won't talk about that on their shows instead they chose to make Rodgers the bad guy and say it's his fault for Adams leaving
😎🏴‍☠️☠️💀🏴‍☠️
I’m glad that devante adams is reunited with Derek Carr since Fresno State, and grew up being a raiders fan now playing with his dream team.
Mr. Adams welcome to our Raiders house. You probably know this. We need your help in the Red Zone big time. So lets do this. "Go Raiders".
Tim brown, C Wood till the numbers fall off!!! RN4L
Let's goooo brother Let's fuckin go!
Welcome to las vegas!! See you at the parade!
I can't believe what we are paying this guy. He is a receiver lol. Right when we are on the cusp of breaking through, we start doing this dumb stuff again. The defense FINALLY plays well and we blow it up. We let ingold go. We make drama about paying Carr but then we give QB money to a receiver lol. One ankle injury away from blowing a ton cap space. I don't feel good about this next season or the 4 or five after it. I don't like coaches that dismantle things that are working because it has it to be "their guy" or "their way". Maybe it's because I have been watching this exact same scenario for 40 years that I am a little jaded but the events in this offseason are THE SAME EXACT blueprint for that has happened for the last 37 years that always ends in us not winning anything. Once again,  the younger fans think this is all brilliant. Same story, not every year, but every decade.
I didn’t hear a good question
LETS GO…RN4L
Davante said he even checked out the Raiders cheerleaders locker room lol my man 😏
Give Isaiah Burse a chance Raiders.
WOW! what a quality individual.
Elite!
Black 🕳
well miss Tae but choices have to be made. so glad to see him be in a place he wants and loves to be in. ill be watching the raiders this year. this is coming from a packer fan. he’ll always be a packer rs. 🧀🤟🏾
Love It
New Coach and GM already winning in the offseason. Now let’s go win on the field. Can’t wait for the season to start!!!
East Palo Alto/ the bay..... represent!!!
This is a beautiful situation. Raider Nation Blessed Finally!
Bruh DA and Waller. My fuckkin goodness
Good luck Adams 👍 Go Pack Go 💚 💛
I've been a Raiders fan since 71. The best news I've heard in a long time good luck to you, Mr Adams!
I think we paid to much for any wr.. that said he seems level headed and well spoken.
Somebody ask what number is he going to wear 15-17
“Volume Receiver” I love the sound of that🔥
Mr.Brown.. Respect Mr. Adams 💯
Let's go get the ring! RaiderNation!!!  Love my Raiders!!!!!
My mind is going crazy imagining what kind of routes are gunna be ran with the raiders offense with their weapons and some big names on defense... CAN'T WAIT!!!
Afc west is officially the Wild Wild West™️ Now!!!
The season is not that long. Classic 💪🏻
o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o   🏴
Lettts Gooooooo ahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
With this new receiving core, I think Derek Carr is going to shatter records next season. Hope to go Everyone stays healthy and we go to the SuperBowl. RaiderNation has been waiting far too long!
Is it true he bought John Grudens house??🤔🧐💰
Power move for Raider nation!
Won't make playoffs won't get 1000 yds in 2022
His money goes up and his stats will go down.. so glad he is off my team green bay is about loyalty and adams showed he has zero loyalty..
Anyone else want to see this dude win a bunch of Superbowls?? Wish you luck Davante
Can he wear #15 and not#17
Damn good for him. So I heard the 49ers/Raiders game won’t be in Vegas  next season and gonna be in Mexico City.
This is a good dude... I hope the best for him👍
You heard it hear first. He will be an average receiver with the raiders
Why it felt like they asked the exact same question the first three questions...
RAAAAAIDERS RAAAAAIDERS RAAAAAIDERS RAAAAAIDERS LET'S GO LET'S GO
What a class act 🎬
His stats dropping for sure. He's going to realize real quick Carr throwing the ball is not Rogers.
raiders took the biggest dub of the offseason
11/10 press conference !!
Not gonna lie, as a die hard Pack fan this makes me sad. Stoked for Tae and Raider Nation. He’s a baller and one of the best there is. Best of luck Tae! Gonna miss you in GB. I’ll still be rooting for you. Black looks good on you. 💯
This man is a beast hall of famer Tae adams
“ Mr. Brown…” Classy.
This guy is so humble just how carr is,they are going to do big things this year I can’t wait idk bout everyone but my hearts racing thinking bout this team and the direction it’s going.
Just did a visual x-ray don't see 1 selfish bone.  Great interview.  Welccome home Te👌🏾👌🏾
He was my favourite player on the Packers but I am going to scream my head off when he gets his first TD as  Raider!!
We’re gonna miss this guy in GB. Enjoy Raider nation. He’s the best.
He had me when he said he grew up a Raider fan! RN4L!
As a Packers fan, watching this is so bittersweet. He looks so happy, happier than when he was in green and gold. I can't stand the mismanagement that we have with a number of our players. I just hope he goes on to further is resume and I wish him the best
Everyone saying therye shocked he's a good person.. I mean Derek carr an him are pretty good friends no wonder csuse dc is a great person with those same values and morals
Dang they already communicated 3x a week while being on different teams speaks to how grea they are definitely gray friends because its hard enough to keep in contact with your best of friends once a month sometimes when your bust professionals let alone being the best at your craft. Must be best friends for real.
Where the carr haters? Y’all been silent
Davante Adams' is an adult.
This trade still didn’t feel real, felt like a dream until I watched this press conference. Lol
Wearing all black!! Welcome to Raider Nation!
My goodness we got the best wide receiver in football D. Adams watch how we attack these defenses lol a great playmaker who knows what he's doing real talk Damm I'm excited now let's go after that chip we coming ya'll # RAIDER NATION
Welcome devonta to the raiders!!! Best wr on planet carr to tae explosion!!
'Hated to see Davante leave Green Bay, but super happy for him and his family's new opportunity/ies and now I'm a Raider's fan, provided they're not playing the Packers on any given day.
I love the pick.up of Devante
💯
Doug doesn't fly?  Never knew that... So happy for the family, E.P.A. and The Bay!  So exciting.
We'll see how he's used and if he can have same success with Carr or close to it
High level guy. Impressive
Shoutout to the Packers fans, keeping it classy.  A great organization with great fans.   Respect,   Raider Nation
I had no idea of this guy's personality. Totally won me over. The signature of the Zieg/Josh era - they have brought in two likely Hall of Famers - one on offense, one on defense.  This guy looks like a GEM.  My heart is still broken about Henry Ruggs.  Davonte looks like the real deal. GOOO RAAAIIIDDDEEERSS!!!!
Great to hear that we have top notch facilities after playing in the baseball sewage for decades! Free agents heard that
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Everyone in the media blames Aaron accept for Davante. He said eloquently. It's about the time that he have and his family
A really cool guy 👍.
Man this year its going to rock!!!!
Always a class act! As a Packer fan i hate to see him go. Will still be cheering for him except when he plays the Pack. Lol....
This young brother exudes positivity and a winning mentality this free agency has been the stuff of dreams, back to being feared and respected, a couple more pieces and I'm feeling Superbowl bound in the next few years 🤍🖤💀
love this guy!! obviously on the field he has been amazing.....   but i can see why by hearing how he responds........  very impressed
Good, I am glade for him I know he will make the raiders a team that can compete with any team in their division. Damn he is getting PAID, I think this makes him the highest paid WR in the entire NFL, good luck Davante Adams.
Lifelong Packers fan but this honestly gives me a great reason to be a Raiders fan too.
Amazed how he knows his Raiders hella dope he was meant to be
September can't come soon enough.
Class act. Has a good head on his shoulders. Welcome home tae….Go Raiders
We couldn’t make the audio a little louder???
Nicest, coolest dude ever. Hate to see him leave the Pack. But he’s getting paid and is playing with his best friend since college. #17
Bring On the season. Just Win Baby☠💀
He IS the MAN. Player in his PRIME and SO humble! He bout to get 1,500 yards and 10 TDs this season. Renfrow and Waller both both gonna get 1,000 yards this season. Jacobs 1,000 rushing yards.
Can’t wait to see the first footage of DC 4 + DA 17= JACKPOT Baby!!🎰 RN4L!!🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
We’re gonna get everything out of him I’m so excited 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️💪
Really hope Waller, renfrow, and adams get 1000 yards 🔥
As a lifetime packers fan this one hurts. Tae is one hell of a dude on and off the field. Congrats Raiders nation y’all got a good one.
I was wondering about the Raiderette locker room too from a Farmer Ted perspective
How and where can I get the iphone 15???
The Raiders make a splash like this every year I  hope this time it works out
This is a real man with great values unlike that turd AB we got a couple of seasons ago. This has a whole different feel to it. Very excited!
A front office that FINALLY overstateds this is a weapons league and edge rushers to stop the QBs from getting them the ball. The team with the best weapons in a system they fit and a edge rush that gets home or helps get turnovers wins. ITS JUST THAT SIMPLE. Well with words finding the correct combination (Players) opens the lock box with the trophy inside.
Are you serious. His answers are all bs. He grew up near Oakland not Las Vegas and was a fan of the Oakland raiders not Las Vegas. All the growing up and family bs was for the California Oakland raiders….. great receiver but let’s be honest it was not because family. It’s a 9 hour drive and 2 hour flight. Only a 6 hour flight to Green Bay. Quit the cap Devante and tell the truth
This is So Awesome ☠️🏴‍☠️💀☠️🏴‍☠️💀🖤🖤🖤
CHILLS!..  Raiders4Life!
Born to be a RAIDER!  Welcome to the NATION!
Ruggs wasn't the answer for us, Adams is. We got the best WR in the league
Can we please sign Isaiah Burse to complete the fresno state trio?
Raaaiiddeerrss  I can't fukkin wait
What an intelligent person. Light years away from Antonio Brown haha. I’m stoked.
Locked in
As a Packers fan it's tough to see him go, but he's earned this dream situation around friends and family. Get this man a ring raiders nation!
I think this addition is a bigger deal than we think it is. I know we gotta sure up the O-line, but I genuinely believe this guy is gonna be a HUGE game changer and should be able to build chemistry with DC again with ease.
IM SO EXCITED
RN4L Go RAIDERS
“Just Win Baby” RAAAAIDERRRS 🏴‍☠️
Been my favourite receiver since he entered the league, so happy he now gets to play in our Silver & Black…Welcome home Tae
As a lifelong raiders fan that has seen way more bad then good I can't believe the way things are headed.  I'm so optimistic about the future and the men we have in charge of the direction of the franchise.  Leaders in the front office and leaders in the locker room.  Time to get back to our consistent winning ways
Man can’t wait for the season to start
So well spoken and exudes confidence! Extremely happy the Raiders were able to trade and extend a man who you can see will help on and off the field. Thank you
very well spoken man look forward to what he'll do with the Raiders
I love how he brought up not forcing the ball for the media and just playin we don't need superstar throws and catches we need Ws!
Let's get that ring Raider Nation
I literally can't say how much I can't wait until next season enough . As a life long Raiders Fan I'm stoked
welcome to the darkside bruh bruh
Can't think of a better situation for the best receiver in the NFL 💯 welcome to the dark side Tae 🖤🏴‍☠️
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💯💯💯
Our offense is stacked !!!!! Now let’s draft that o line
Good guy with his head screwed on just right, happy for him!
Welcome Brother to Raidernation! Welcome to the Dark side 💀🖤 There's only one Nation!
I now want his jersey
Sorry to hear about your grandma 🙏 congratulations to and your wife on your new baby…. And welcome to the Raider Family and Raider Nation…. Time to get working let’s go Raiders….
Adams the man the myth now home to be a Raiders Great! RN4L 🔥🏆
He’s actually a raider
This is so cool to see
Man I’m so stoked!
Sorry Tae, our reporters tend to be repetitive morons. Hondo is the exception
Man happy for this guy..like how confident..but humble he is..cant wait to see this guy go to work
💯🚀💯
We gave you guys Woodson, Yall gave us Devante Adams💪🏻💯
He’s a spectacular player but most importantly an amazing person !☠️
Does anyone know what number Adams gonna wear?? #17 or #15??
Man you got a gem. Been watching him with our Packers since he got here. They don’t make them much better than him. Wish him the best.
Really too bad Reggie Mckenzie didn't draft Devante in 2014 with Carr. Must have been tough for Devante to see his best friend Derek Carr who also was a Raiders fan growing up to go to the Raiders and he went to Green Bay
Seems like a total class act.  So excited for THE RAAAAIIIDDDEERRRSSS!!!
Lord please protect our raiders & keep them healthy for this upcoming szn🤞🏼
12td 1320 receiving yards 100 catches for devante Adams this season
I realized how special he is going to be for the Raiders when he said Renfrow might be able to teach him things!! Talk about a guy with NO Ego!! Love This!! He said that he doesn't want Derek to force him the ball. How Smart is this guy? Loving him even more!!
Man this season can’t come fast enough. Let’s go raider nation
That was so awesome!!! I really didn't know anything about Devante from a more personal perspective, just on the field but after hearing him talk he seems so cool and so happy to be A Raider. Love how he said "growing up I was all about the Raiders, my whole family is Raiders fans so I know a ton about the history"
Seems like a great guy. Had enough of these young clowns that can't handle Vegas. We need MEN on this team like Adams & Carr.  We aren't rebuilding. We're _RELOADING!_
My man says. We weren't schemin this up throughout the year... my man be sendin cryptic last dance tweets twice a month... don't lie bro just be honest
Once a Packer always a Packer Much Love 17
Cummiewummiehadabear
Dream come true... Raider nation 🏆🍾💯💪
wow. had no idea he was so well spoken. Rare for an NFL athlete. I'm impressed. I hope he can help get the team over the KC hump
I love the fact that his football focus is to get to the Super Bowl
RAAAAAAIDERRRRS RAAAAAAIDERRRRS RAAAAAAIDERRRRS
This is like such a good nfl storyline. An organic one at that.
What a night and day difference between this man and Antonio Clown.
Please don't  do the ruggs🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽☠️☠️☠️
Humble hope GOD will bless you and your family

56:23 You're welcome
“Derek got that gunslinger mentality, that’s what I’m all about. I’m a volume receiver I wanna see as many balls I can, I’m sure we won’t have a problem with that around here” FACTS
RAIDDEEEERRRRRRRSSSSSSS!!!!!! This season is gonna be so exciting, I can't wait
Adams, Robinson, Renfrow, Waller at Tight End. Oh man, too dangerous. This is a Madden fantasy squad. Hope the league is ready for this. Raiders are coming to make noise and get that #4 Lombardi
Let's gooooo welcome to the silver and black. And thank you
man I feel him on that important things in life ! 💯  so glad he's here
Ive been patiently waiting for this press conference sinced last Thursday. really good questions and especially the last question asking him to address raidernation😎☠️ priceless!You know he's hella proud to be that guy,to be apart of raidernation 4 life...
Welcome to the the Raiders D! We all here in the valley never forgot how you and Derek put our beloved Dogs on the map and we all always stood true fans of you, so this is like a dream to us to reunite you with Carr. May GOD bless you and your families future. Thank you for coming to LV , your jersey will be on every Fresno Raider breathin. Can't wait till September!
Dude had a huge impact in Green Bay. I’ll watch every Raiders game this year cause I’m not going to miss watching him play
Dude seems solid and grounded.
Was there really nothing on live for almost 1 hour???
If you are reading these comments. I am very grateful that you came to the Raiders been a fan since 73 and love the attitude and your humility. That shows the person you are and like every Raider fan you made my day. Now please help get a superbowl. Thank you Davante
I still cant believe this happened
This man could not have a single catch all season and I'd still be proud to wear his name on a black jersey. Just a good dude.

RAAAIIIDEEERRRSSS! welcome to the family! #17 D.A
I AM ROCK HARD RIGHT NOW
Ok 👌 I appreciate folks outlook! I’m not saying that I’ve have or have not seen every press conference. But what I will say when it comes to this Young Man I hear 👂 no I listen 👂 to what sounds to be a Humble Man!! He sold me and the thing about it is, he didn’t need to who am I In regards of his life? No one! But it’s cool that this cat can be something in mines? Just a solid cat! Playing On a time that we both grew up on. It ain’t nothing like THE TOWN as Baby Ray Would Say!!
Welcome home 🐐
I love Davante and wish him nothing but the best on his journey with the Raiders . always and forever will support him 💪❤
An impressive young man. I liked that when they asked him if he used not being picked first as motivation and he replied he has other things to motivate him like his family, kids, etc.
As excited as I am just imagine how excited his family is as lifelong Raider fans too.
Been hearing about OBJ as a possible signing. I would mind honestly👌😏 what y'all think?
Can't wait! BTW super shocked he didn't pick #15 . But 17 is still doep
Now i know why they were a big duo at Fresno State.. family,  humble love it
It would have been awesome if he would have changed his number to 15. (While he was in college) but still awesome to have him as a Raider
RN4L💯 we goin all the way. Just Win Baby!
Like it or not the faith in God, family & the Raiders reminds of another guy. LEGENDARY VINCE LOMBARDI. JUST WIN BABY.
RAIDER NATION WE BACK TIME TO KICK A** AGAIN☠️⚔️☠️
Welcome HOME ! The Black Pearl will set sail soon enough and bring with it a barrage of talent and dominate the NFL  ! 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️ Wulfy OG RAIDER NATION
Happiest I've been as a Raider fan
Welcome to the OG Raider Nation DaVante! Reggie should have drafted you with DC in 2014!   *McD needs to vastly improve Raiders "RZ TD to short FG" ratio bigly with this offenses potential (Derek too). Adams, Waller, Hunter, Hollis/Edwards/Robinson, Drake & Josh c'mon now lets go!
Video doesn't start until 56:24
Literally the perfect situation for him. Childhood team, best friend at QB, familiarity with WR Coach & tax free state to save bank for his family
I'm not a Raiders fan but I am absolutely a Devante Adams fan now. We need more men of character like him in this world.
Best quote: 17 opportunities to show everything you got. Yessir! This is a team we can be proud of on and off the field. Raider nation can rock that shield with pride. Yessir!
Classy presentation.
This guy reminds me so much of Tim Brown with his humble demeanor and his love for the Raiders.
I love this guy! I can’t wait to get the #17 Adams jersey!!! 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Mexico 🇲🇽
