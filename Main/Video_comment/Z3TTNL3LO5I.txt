The quails are now at an animal sanctuary where they’re able to live long happy lives together rather than being slaughtered for dog food by the way ❤

Eggs aren't refrigerated in the UK,and other parts of Europe, making the possibility of hatching an egg with an incubator  possible
Congrats 🎉.
You can get an incubator with an egg turner

9:37 woowwwwwww
I just cannot stop cryin omgggg like the egg is actually alive I wish you great luck hope your having a great time and taking goood care off it
I am so late but this video is actually beautiful, it shows the beauty of life itself this is pure peakness
heres a way to make this video way more cinematic: In the golden hush of early spring, beneath a canopy of sagebrush and sun-dappled grass, a tiny egg trembled. It was the smallest of the clutch, nestled between its siblings like a shy whisper. Then—crack!—a beak poked through, and out tumbled Pip, a baby quail with downy fuzz and eyes full of wonder. Pip was born into a bustling covey of California quail, known for their topknot plumes and their tendency to scurry like wind-blown leaves. His mother, Junia, was a vigilant guardian, and his father, Bramble, strutted with pride. Pip, however, was different. While his siblings darted and pecked with precision, Pip often lagged behind, distracted by the shimmer of dew or the shadow of a hawk overhead. “Stay close!” Junia chirped, nudging him forward as the family foraged. But Pip’s curiosity was a wildfire—uncontainable and bright. One morning, while chasing a butterfly through a thicket, Pip stumbled upon a clearing he’d never seen. It was quiet, save for the rustle of grass and the distant call of a mourning dove. He froze. Alone. The butterfly vanished, and so did his sense of direction. Panic fluttered in his chest like trapped wings. But then, a rustle. A jackrabbit emerged, ears twitching. “Lost, are you?” it asked. “I—I was chasing something,” Pip stammered. “Chasing’s fine,” said the rabbit, “but knowing when to stop—that’s wisdom.” With a nod, the rabbit bounded away, leaving Pip to retrace his steps. It took hours, but eventually, he heard Junia’s call—sharp and worried. When he returned, she didn’t scold him. She simply tucked him under her wing, and Pip felt the warmth of forgiveness. As weeks passed, Pip grew. His fuzz gave way to feathers, his legs strengthened, and his topknot began to sprout—a proud little comma of fluff. He learned to dust-bathe, to evade snakes, and to recognize the scent of danger. But he also learned to listen—to the wind, to the silence, and to the stories Bramble told at dusk. “Every quail must face the sky,” Bramble said one evening. “We’re ground birds, yes, but the sky tests us. Storms, hawks, droughts—they shape us.” Pip took those words to heart. One summer day, a wildfire swept through the valley. Smoke curled like serpents, and the covey scattered. Pip, now nearly grown, led three younger chicks through the underbrush, remembering the rabbit’s advice, Bramble’s stories, and Junia’s calls. He found a hollow beneath a rock ledge and waited out the blaze, shielding the chicks with his body. When the fire passed, the land was scorched, but Pip emerged—singed but strong. The covey reunited, and Junia looked at him not as her baby, but as a leader. By autumn, Pip’s feathers gleamed with adult sheen. His topknot bobbed with confidence, and his stride was sure. He no longer chased butterflies, but he watched them, understanding their dance. One crisp morning, Pip stood atop a sun-warmed stone, surveying the valley. He saw trails he’d wandered, dangers he’d faced, and lessons he’d learned. A younger quail approached, eyes wide. “Will you teach me to forage?” the chick asked. Pip smiled. “Of course. But first—tell me what you see.” The chick blinked. “Grass. Rocks. Bugs.” “And beyond that?” The chick squinted. “Possibility?” Pip nodded. “Exactly.” And so, the baby quail who once chased butterflies became a mentor, a protector, and a storyteller. His journey was etched in feathers and footsteps, in the hush of sagebrush and the whisper of wind. Because every quail, no matter how small, carries the sky within them.
I can’t not wait to see if they will hatch!
This is amazing that is so crazy that these quails might have been somebody’s breakfast 😢
WOW!!!😮 that much of chicks
Let's goo bro you are a good guy i wish more people are like you
does no one realize how comically hypocritical this video is?
I’m from the UK as well yes get them chickens😂😂😂
Bro is becoming a commander of chicks
Oh no i ate quail egg yesterday
0:04 thats what i see every day for breakfast wthats the point?
Leaving a comment on all your videos until you do a collab with my cockatiel.
Uhm no, this is fake
Uhm no, this is fake
my 5th grade class incubated 30 quail eggs and only 9 remained. My favorite one was named vampire and he was a little devious cuz he kept escaping 🤣🤣🤣
😮😮😮😮
THEIR SO CUTE 😭😭😭
first get a male quail  secondly make it fertilize the eggs and thats it
I HAVE 3 CHICKS AND I NOTICED THAT QUAILS ARE CUTER THAN CHICKS, But god said be thankful so i did that
I was not expecting that ending
Why are you not finishing your breakfast, that's so wasteful
9.9kth
I hatched chickens
It’s is truly beatiful that you did this jay you have inspired me you have helped me so much during hard times in school. And get my grades up by believing in myself.
Mate you actually did that I couldn’t believe my eyes 😂
The Viedio  Is Realy Well mate
I sub
Biggest bullshit I ever see :D whats a point ? I buy eggs to eat not hatch :D Act like first time to know chikens or etc comes from eggs
I like this😊😊😊😊
I know I'm a year late but I'm obsessed with this video. I love that you brought new life into the world🙏🏽❤️
Cool ches
Lucky I hate to eat eggs so I'm not killing eny chicks
What's the name of the music that started playin after 8:33 ?
infinite food glitch
can i have one
Cool stuff!😆😆😆
I thought you were going to fertilize them and try, not just throwing them in an incubator 😂
Now I’m gonna hatch some eggs baby
Can u give one to me they look SO cute!!!!!!
14:21 you have an Italian hat! My country
whats that website called? 5:50
14:57 wait is therw one chicken?
I always thought eggs in supermarkets are infertile?
That expert saying has 0 chance in a fading edit was 🤣
😅😊 nice  you know why
i don't think that's possible, supermarket eggs aren't fertile because they're supposed to come from egg farms where they don't have roosters to fertilize a chicken, I'm supposing that if you manage to have one, you got an egg from a non-supermarket to get views and clicks tbh XD
This si one of the most heartwarming videos xxx Sub guys! P.S.: I am back to not eating eggs though, for long time for sure
So cool i want to do that when I'm older
67😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
im crying watching this bro no way u saved lots of lives
Most eggs in the store are infertile (chicken eggs), as you can see 2/3 eggs for a completely different case scenario didn't hatch...
193 hatched eggs out of 360 supermarket eggs is over 50% of eggs that were fertilized when it's legally supposed to be 0%. Sainsbury's is so screwed lol.
The quail army was the best part
i love youre videos ❤
Loved your excitement so much ❤
i love that vid, it reley open my perpecson
I used to think you was a bit of a numb skull but I gotta say jay you did well with this one. Nice work man 👍👍
I hatched 100 eggs they still aliv
Awwwww
This video was egg-celent
There is the army😂😂 13:44
You also need to add more stuff in the cage. It would be much better for them I think.😅 12:23
Once I heard you’re incubating an entire army, I jumped up and started screaming yes yes yes 11:02 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Omg you did it. I literally started crying once I saw you crying and I was like oh my God, a quail hatched. This is my very first time watching your videos and I subscribed your video is so good and I love it so much. I thought I would hate it and it would be just fake like other videos, but it isn’t wow. 8:33 ❤❤❤❤
Why are they throwing the ducks? 2:11 I mean chicks.
I would like a pet quil
Omgggg sooooooo cute 🥰
In kindergarten my teacher was gonna hatch 9 egg but only 2 alive they call one Bailey and cutey
A chick called Albert YouTube channel did this over 10 years ago. I think he is in the Netherlands.
When I saw the second one I was like: ya ya ya ya ya tadaaa I'm alivee😊
Can I ask for them to sleep in you going to become beating big chickens if they won't be if they have and leave them alone fuel protector eggs if you get close to your body
I have a chick he's a little please and then you take me to carefully after he said leave him alone with help with a hatching can I have time zone
you are a saint! thank you for saving the quails!
Good luck
Hey Jay can you buy and create  an army of chicks
It's not possible
That is so amazing. This is so beautiful life is just life is just things never been seen before sometimes like people say it’s zero chance it will never happen but sometimes it will world the world is a bunch of surprises. Life is just it’s hard to explain, but life is just beautiful.
I wonder what he will do with all those quails now?
I love eggs bro. It’s been my dream to hatch an egg but I haven’t even hatched an egg once in my life I had a hen and the rooster but one time I wasn’t in my country and it hatched and I didn’t get to see how it hatched.😢😢
I wish I didn't watch this now I think every time I eat a egg I get worried
Aww u didnt do your research before hatching suppost to stop the egg turner before they hatch call lock down could have broke there leg
😂

Charizard
Its attack of the cuteness quails!
Imagine how many fertile eggs we have eaten before I gained this knowledge, I am beyond ashamed 😂😂😂
13:53 this is so goofy 🤣🤣
And that's the buety of life
I used to have a little chicken that's a baby 10 days or 14 days it died it was really super sad and emotional to me
I’m watching from Modesto, California. I’m loving this video and can’t wait to watch more! I even subscribed! Let’s goooo! 🎉

Nothing is impossible ❤️‍🩹
Mate, you just won a new instant subscriber! ❤ What you did there was astonishing!
inf egg glitch 🤣
eggs aren't in fridge?
I subscribed 😁
Should I try this
CONGRATULATIONS 9:30
I am sorry but the women is talking nonsense lol
omg - that ahole just chucking those baby quails into a box - humans are Vile Jay - hope this experience makes you more sensitive to your future egg / meat purchases.   Seriously, humans are sh+t, so cruel.
In America all the eggs are stored in the refrigerator section of the store. No chance of chicks but every now and then there are eggs that have started to develop so from the farm they are not separated from the boys.
i wanna try this it is so cool i hope they are having a good time of their life not being food
this is so cool. it is so rare and makes me happy.
Bro I'm am going to do that when I grow up😂😂😂😂
the babies are really gonna 1v100 solo carry us
awwww i sub ❤❤🐤🐤🐣🐣
Omg there are so many😂
♡<3❤
I actually managed to hatch some quails from eggs too but quite a few died so now there are two but you might be a led to hatch more from market bought eggs
yo this is my favorite video from ur channel
What happened to them?
I almost cried to this😭😭
323
The fact that I'm eating eggs while watching this is crazy

One time when i was making cooked quil eggs there was one that had veins i mean two had veins and the other two i ate

1:44 How inseminated eggs get into the supermarket.
Thay was gonna be food!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The miracle in of life
The crazy thing is that I got a Next video About burgers 🍔 ;)
This honestly is crazy to me because when I was a kid, I used to always wish I could hatch a baby chicken from a grocery store egg and sometimes I would even try but I didn’t have an incubator so I kind of failed and it was just funny, but this video tells me that even though things may seem impossible. There’s always a way that it can happen I mean, of course not always but most of the time there’s always a way that something would work out.
Can't believe you did that all by yourself
E
T
La
Wow
this is amazing
Not the boss music at 13:21
Мне всегда казалось что вылупить яйца из магазина возможно, опираясь сколько из русского сегмента столько людей это как раз и сделало Но вот армию - это уже прикол

Quail eggs often are able to hatch from store eggs.
Its trou amiracoll
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
9:20  when the egg hatched
You made it where that sometimes eggs can hatch beautiful things and turn into something great but even knowing we eat eggs, some and most vegan in school understand but not about the part that you’re saying we should all be loved because we’re just killing life sources even knowing we need those to survive and I get that usually happened to me once I understand we needed it for protein and get strong like our ancestors in the one our me, but I understand that we need to eat the eggs for protein and so we can get strong like our ancestors and be brave for our loved ones and make sure they are protected like the quails cause the quails sometimes will hurt other animals to try and protect others that’s why most quails aren’t found in Texas but Texas is strong like whales and Eagles quails are mostly close to equal so basically eagles or quails ancestors.
No no no no no no nature be love
This is so cute this is my second time watching
That’s how people became vegan 👏👏
Hi

14:38 vitimans
Bro the choosen one cool
Supermarket eggs are infertile. They live in small areas, no outside. There are only hens and pullets.
thats the camera i have
thats ileggal though
Aw hell nah why do it look like that 0:04
In the United States, this would be totally cap. Supermarket bought eggs are supplied from hens with no roosters around. Until recently, the hens were kept in single, very small cages on an assembly line.
Wow 🎉 you hatched the eggs
OK, you have a really friendly question I want to ask was this real because I tried this and it didn’t work because I live in the US and you live in the UK but it doesn’t matter you gotta tell me is this real
1:57 the way he threw the chick, so disrespectful to an infant
THATS meole brace retail park I’m lit across the road from there
🎉 Proud to be a vegetarian 😊😊😊
Omg that is so cool you are saving many lives
Awwww there so cute
Companies are very secretive. I didn’t know that.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ur british erm i heard u say sainburys
It was amazing it's amazing what you're doing. You're actually getting thrilled. You're actually making life out of an egg. Those salt in the supermarket like white. It's almost impossible. There's a 000 chance that you could actually get this, but you're doing it.  There's a 001% chance. You will actually get this and you're getting one right now. I believe in you right now. I believe in. You can do it so keep on doing what you're doing. Make life that people will not most people will not. Do you gotta save what people are dying? What people are making die.

Yay many quails saved from the burning pan to be breakfast for we monsters
Good job 🎉
Dear jay, I have completely was shocked when a baby quail popped out of the egg as my expectations were a little lower when that expert said it was a 0 chance, hope you become a great father for them, they are absolutely adorable and I admire how you care for them so much like your very one children.
I want to hug you. those little birds were gonna be in someone's stomach but you saved them and gave them a chance at life
Chick named albert.
I love this
it made me cry
No FUCKING way you made an army of quails
Idk why but the editing and narrating of this video is so goddamn annoying...
any one in 2025?😂
love your vid
Jay, you are the coolest YouTuber I’ve ever seen
I cried for joy when I saw there eggs hatching
The eggs in supermarket have no roster dad, they just got a hen mom, so they would not hatch.  The eggs are produced like in a factory settings.
Your biggest fear is here🥀🥀🥀
I give lives supermarket chicks to!!!!!
I want u to send me the stuff that u used
She said 0% more like 5% cuz you managed!
are you gonna keep all those for their entire life or what?
9:52 didn't have to show the cat too, man, can't trust it
UWU
How are they doing now
Please keep them
The actent
00 my oh my oh my 000 my oh my oh my god, oh my oh my god, oh my god, oh how how? How how? How did you do that? How did you do that? How? How did you just do that? I don’t know how did you just did that? Just was a freaking thing which is a chick. Oh my god oh my god, 000 my god oh my god, oh my god

Vegan vegan vegan vegan wait a minute i eat egg
Hi 12:38
6:57 WHAT DID HE SAY PEOPLE, PLEASE HELP
CONGRATS
Hiiiiiii
How much was the Amazon incubator
While it's highly unlikely, it is technically possible to hatch a quail chick from a Tesco (or any supermarket) egg, including those from a Tesco quail egg box, but the odds are very low. The vast majority of eggs sold in supermarkets are not fertilized, meaning they cannot develop into chicks. However, some commercial farms do allow a small number of roosters with their hens, and very rarely, a fertilized egg can end up in the supply chain
15:00 this is sooooooo emotional im very happy you saved that many quail chicks whos lives were supposed to be (not even hatched yet and become breakfast😢)im very happy for your kind act❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊you deserve 30000000000000000+ subscribers like me❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

What are vitamins
QUAİLVENGERS! (Quail avengers)k
No one talking about the ai thumbnail
Sainsbury's or any other company could not care less whether you hatched the eggs or found a lizard in one. Their only interest is to SELL the eggs after buying them as cheaply as possible from the suppliers. However, a fertile egg may survive in a dormant state for up to 10 days, after that it will die, in most cases, a fertile egg left alone without heat or turning will not survive. While a fertilized egg can remain dormant for a period, it needs consistent warmth and turning to develop and hatch.   Supermarket eggs come from mainly poultry houses which produce infertile eggs, there are no male birds there and the hens have a life from hell in confined cages, the eggs are laid into a sloping channel where they roll down to a collecting point. Hens will produce infertile eggs for a long time.  . The eggs you find in grocery stores are almost always infertile. This video is therefore suspect.
13:50 AVENGER ASSEMBLE😅
Woah 9:38
from now on I will check all supermarket eggs before I eat them!!!
I would let then defeat me no matter what their to cute 🥰 😊
You did what they said you couldn’t do

Hi I’m Minecraft kid I make Minecraft videos
Are you in Thetford when you bought the eggs
Oh my gosh, she grew life from a one percent chance of having an egg that’s pretty amazing busy being a mother and not having to have any children and then one day you get really lucky and get one. I think the farm was gonna be so mad.

Condition of this chickens will be very bad
this woman is completely full of sh*t .  The store and suppliers could not care less.
The other reason they make sure the eggs are unfertilized is to make sure a customer doesn't have to deal with the chance of an embryo coming out while they're trying to make Breakfast.
Ive always wondered about this  and if it's possible. I didn't think it was
Wow
This was a year ago, I know, but it actually brought me to tears
YOUTUBE
WHAT THE
Your videos go from really funny, silly and a joy (your laugh when Romell stapled his frown cracked me up🤣) to incredibly intelligent documentary style and thought provoking (this and making your own game console and game).  It’s a joy to go through your videos from years ago to now 👏.  Really enjoying the haunted and you building things, woodworking and Lego skills on point!  Popcorn car and slides and everything else .  You are a full on entertainment package!

Jay wife is chicken 😂😂😂😂 congrats being father of army😂😂
Hatch more  You have kind heart 😢😢❤❤

I didn’t watch this yet but pretty sure this is impossible because the eggs that grow chicks have an extra cell thingy or something like that and supermarket eggs don’t have that.
I like you
They will not because they’re not able to climb stairs

55% hatch rate is crazy
Your the absolute legend, very absolute!!  As a vegetarian that is kind of vegan bc the only animal product i eat (drink) is milk, i was honestly suprised that, this many chicks could hatch, especially from a super market, and it hurts to me to see that many people have eaten an egg that could've lived its life, look at those cute lil babies, i especially ABSOLUTELY LOVE animals birds insects and fish, all types of living creatures, congrats on being a father of an army of quails,

If you don’t subscribe to this guy, what are you doing??
Yup
You should have got goose eggs to destroy the world
Hello

❤❤❤❤❤
Little baby chicks

9:08 5 more minutes ahh
This is my dream 😭
He’ll yeah I wanna try this
Interesting
this video made me have happy tears
Prove the chicken expert wrong
With free range, it's more likely.  And stop rotating the eggs, when they are close to hatching.
Bro sucks and your videos
Sauron: "Build me an army."
YouTube just commented 2 channels 💀💀
hi
I was hoping for chickens lol
Good job on being a dad 😂
I took the egg from a fridge and now its day 7 and I see little veins im so happy
13:58 i like your army
So what are you going to do with these 200 chicks? Start a farm?
Whaaat they are not supposed be able to grow because they are not supposed to be fertilized. BUT I have found blood and even veins in a few eggs, especially recently. I was super grossed out. I'm in  NY, USA. On regular chicken eggs.
where did you get the egg checker thingy from?
The bottom bit is the air sack
This is my new goal for this year! SAVE THE CHICKS!!
What about a Baby Chick I think some of the Eggs actually has Life you dont know for sure he truly theyre some Eggs with Life that I didnt know

Hi
I love your videos
I'm a new subcriber
I'm still eating eggs.
A chick called Albert didnt lie and did it
What about the supplier did he lose his job
Quails assemble
What does he plan to do with all those eggs?
This lady is over playing what she saying, this happens often and NO ONE cares
i i defently dont have eggs as my favorit food i do
Grocery store eggs aren't fertilized your a scam.
I found 2 abandoned eggs today and start intubating! This video gives me hope!!
Quails are awesome little birds when mine died i couldnt go through the heartache of getting more amd loosing them again so i didnt so what do u feed the chicks btw thanks for sharing
UK anyone
Me realising thats my local sainsburys
Hey Jay, Can you do this again
Thanks for the idea my incubator is coming now
I subscribe and liked
bro is about to become a vegan
is the quail army still alive 1 year after?
Bro I was surprised humans waste 780 eggs each year like what is wrong with the world.
My teacher said that her moms mom/ her grandma is in the hospital😢
You might solve the egg crisis
Good job , you turned the eggs from someone's breakfast to someones lunch.
You guys sell your eggs on the shelf room temp if not mistaken? Ours here in NA are washed and thus have to be kept refrigerated the whole time so thinking I can’t pull this off
"The supermarkets don't want you CREATING baby chicks from eggs." News flash, you're not creating anything, you are developing-through incubation-something that has already been created through fertilization. 😂
You should do this with chicken eggs too. Because lately we have been getting a lot of store bought chicken eggs that have the ability to have life
You can't hatch supermarket eggs they unfertilised this video Is fake
Wow, that was amazing and emotional.
I know I am a little late to comment but congratulations for your tricks
And inspired
You’ve done a good job
Bro at least blur it
Try duck eggs and chicken eggs does that do it aswell
This is why, when you have a farm, the animals remain named… lunch and dinner. We do not make them pets.
To be fair, they don’t wash and refrigerate eggs like we do in the U.S.
Ai thumbnail is crazy
I'm in 2025
Unlimited quail eggs
Are supermarket eggs fertilized?
These honestly makes me sad because i could be eating real cute quails, yet im still going to eat chickens and everything else because im not vegan.  🐣🐣🐥
Eggs are like menstruation. A chicken lays an egg every day. Even if they’ve never met a rooster in its life.     You can’t hatch supermarket eggs
@brettlemay3263 0 seconds ago ?  When a chicken lays an egg on an egg farm the eggs are unfertilized.   Unless the hen came in contact with a rooster before (which doesn’t happen typically on an egg farm), all the eggs have no embryos inside of them.  So they will not hatch, even if incubated.
.....I'm going try that
My dad has the same camera to catch robbers
Good job 👏 👍🎉
that vegen teacher after watching this video buy every super market eggs to save the chicks
0:40 the eyebrows
You made my day . Because of you there is life.
I might just incubate every egg just so I won't eat a fertile one.
Looks like their rising from the dead 😂
😂 just eat your eggs mate. 🥚
"Never back down never what!?" Ahh bro
Why aint i there
from the channel its my first video and now my favirote youtuber
Bro is a life saver
Next step eat chicken 😊
But I don't understand  how will they know?   Edit:the video 😅
stop using AI for your thumbnails
The idea you can Hatch chicks from supermarket eggs is kind of disgusting, it means we eat eggs filled with sperm 🤢
💞💞💞💞💞💓
Definitely cool but I wonder what the heck are you doing with all that baby chicks ? What if they lay eggs?? Lol
Great video horrible AI thumbnail
Supermarkets don’t want you to do that because chiken can lay eggs so you get free eggs that’s why
THIS WOULD NEVER WORK IN NORTH AMERICA, ALL THE EGGS ARE WASHED AND REFRIGERATED WHEN LEAVING THE FARM AND KEPT REFRIGERATED IN THE STORES
Why yalls eggs so small 😂
ชyou can make well it clap
You stole unspeakablereacts thumbnail
Where the gd update? You’ve had a year
What will you do when they grow
Maybe you should fertilise the eggs next time for a higher chance of them hatching
So half of the eggs contain life this whole time?
But aren't the eggs sold in the market unfertilized? Meaning they can never be hatched!
AND ALL OF THE VEEEIIINNNSAHH
Next time turn the turner off a couple days before hatch
Ballshit
Eggs sold at stores cannot hatch as they are not fertilized. Can’t believe people are so stupid to not understand this.
Can you share the link of the big incubator please thanks
It's... it's alive!
Wonder what he were to do next  don't seem to have a yard big enough   little   shed house 😂
YOU ARE WILD!!!
if im honest i just wanna know what chair you got i feel like its literally the only thing not listed 😂

Yo nice vid I actually never knew supermarkets had baby chick eggs

Your excitement when you realised you were going to be a dad! 😄❤️

Even better meal in the future.
Albert the chicken has done this before
Wow! Good work. Love from Louisiana! Odds were not with you!😊
🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄Facepalm... So many gullible and naive people on here! You CANNOT hatch chicken form supermarket eggs, because they are not fertilized, DUUUH! You need chicken and rooster to produce fertilized egg with chick embrio. The eggs that are in supermarket do not contain embrio. All female birds produce unfertilized eggs regardless if they mated, just like human woman that has periods. Those eggs are not fertile. It only takes male and female bird to produce fertilized egg.  Besides very low temperature for several days in the store refrigerator would kill egg embrio, that you have ZERO chances pf hatching anything.
how do you know the eggs you bought at the supermarket are fertilized??? magic?
Forget eggs......deep fried quail...........mmmmmmmm
The baby chicks are adorable! 🥰
Nice more protein 😋
Bro just when creative move an spawn chickens
You shouldn’t hold them after few hours you need wait a day
my dog of 17 years is preparing for his next journy in life, im not ready for it, idk why i never readied myself for it. Feeling things, expressing thing, even now is a learning process for me. Looking like im too mean to get to know all my life and i feel like a child that lost their icecream. Hearing you express excitement and emotions is helpful to me to me at this place in my life. Thank you.
So what happened to Sainsbury after that? Did they do anything to you?
He spawned a bird in his house
I am  eating  🍳🍳
The luckiest chicks ever
I wonder why the supermarkets dont want people having fertile eggs that could hatch. like why they care?
This is such a creative idea, and i  respect you so much for not clickbaiting us. Great vid jay 👌👏
What is the egg candler you used?
Good deed for a good man Thanks for helping us and them

So cute
I did this and they died after meeting the world swept one and chicki  is now a big girl laying me eggs for me 🤗
I'm at 13 minutes and 25 seconds and I'm starting to get terrified and I like feel so happy for you to get to raise animals like they're your children that's what I want to do one day cuz I'm going to be a farmer we bought a property and we're planning to have chickens and I want to do that with chicken eggs
We're getting a farm in building a house on it and we're going to get some chickens
I've tried a dozen for 3-4$ quail eggs but nothing with my home made incubator so im gave up.
Bros gonna make the chicks into kfc💀
OMG 🎉
I will also say that you will get a better hatch rate if you stop opening the incubator and taking the eggs out so much
I am a game farmer and can promise you that they will take eggs from the laying boxes to meet demand for an order. I regularly eat pheasant eggs that are left over and don’t go in the incubator
Yo suund lak yuuu fam lunnnddunnn
Haiti Jay great job I'm in the hospital  hoping for somone to help me im missing  a kindny and I'm only 12 so  I only have 5 months left Please keep up the good cids

Best thing I’ve seen is like waiting to have a baby in real life !!! You’re loving that egg just like a human that’s beautiful!!!   ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹🙏🏽✅✅✅✅✅👑
i'd love to know what the Supermarket did afterwards😭😭
So did you follow up with the grocery store?
And I thought I was obsessed with my 14 goose eggs and 12 chicken eggs I’m currently incubating lmao. Awesome video, hatching eggs is such a wonderful experience
I'm never eating qual eggs
That’s not possible because the eggs need to be fertilized
🥲
Call the quail Army.
That’s pretty awesome . Had no clue you could even do this . 😂😂 I hope you ruffled a lot of feathers
Dont the eggs have to be fertilized?
They imprint on you fam 10:48
I have hatched hundreds and hundreds of eggs in incubators. Everybody knows at least days before hatch. You're supposed to take them out of the automatic Turner. How come you didn't?
Great god this is my first video of watching you and i love it

Cute baby chicks🐥
I wish this had parts
miss TGF for this exact reason. just mad shit, but also you get so deeply engrossed. Love this guy 😂
12:53  day 18, this happened. *simply piano add*:jingle bells jingle bells
I did this before in my school and the chicks are gonna hatch on the 26th (wish the chicks luck)
quail eggs can hatch without fertilisation, so whats all this shit about 'oh people will get into trouble if these hatch and they're going to lose their license'? misleading watchbait at its finest.
I really really really want it while I don’t like eggs. I only eat boiled eggs but now I don’t think I’m gonna eat eggs.😊
Awesome I believe in u anything is possible try ur best and u will be successful
You posted this on my bday
I was thinking of doing something similar just a couple of days ago. but i'm going to wait until I have more space to home some. I really do have a hard time eating eggs now, especially when I crack them and see that little black spot in the yoke.
Is this from a free range batch or caged? I'm guessing free range considering what the box looked like. Don't know how people buy caged bird eggs anyway but just wondering if the chance of this being possible is different for each category 🤔
8:34 BABY QUAIL MODE
11:17 m-massive?
That is absolutely unbelievable I was giggling like crazy when the army came running out the incubator 😂😂😂
1 like=1 push up
i think this video is super cool! well done and keep it up! i actually loved this video. good job!
Can you hatch chicken supermarket eggs
😊😊😊❤❤❤ so. cuteeeeee
BS. Supermarket eggs aren't fertilized. They are periods not fetuses. Even if they were the cold would have killed them. They have to be kept a very strict temperature. Any egg that hatches didn't come from a grocery store. This is complete garbage that it's some store conspiracy.  Y'all are fools for believing this man.
Life IS so exciting! Wait til you become a dad to a human baby! You'll be great!! <3
Wait but how did you get your hands on fertile eggs?
Good vid
I am
Amazing vvideo ❤😊

I am never gonna eat an egg again
Brilliant that i need to try it

Just found this channel love the content bruh
Wonder if this is less possible in the US since the eggs are in the refrigerator from the start.
You make the best videos❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m excited with you as I watched your video!!!
ZERO CHANCE 😂😂😂
I am speechless as i can express anything but it is goodies video in the world that shows no sins❤❤❤😂🎉

Did you become vegetarian ?
Jay you are awesome!
i'm glad to see i'm not the only one so fascinated with doing this, it's so amazing !!!
Ez
Aww their so cute.  And they have each other for company.  Congratulations 🎊 👏
You’re the best person ever
How is this possible when they haven't been fertilized?
I drank coco milk wen I saw this.
Quails are native to southern England
Whats happened to them all?
I wanna try this can’t lie
Any one 2026??
What happened to the army?
What I'd like to know, is what he did with all these chicks?
This is my video of the day 😂
Lies. Supermarket eggs come from hen farms. No roosters present.
I smiled very deep with these quails hatching.  Your awesome sir. My kids can't wait to try this now! Thank you!
I was all excited thinking I could do this until I saw your eggs over there aren’t refrigerated in stores 😢 so in the US there’s a 0% chance because they are refrigerated in stores
if they wont be someones breakfast then it will be someone lunch 🤣☠
Not possible unless maybe you have organic eggs that are free run? And if the eggs are older than 10 days snd being refrigerated even if fertile lowers the chance of hatching. I've heard egg is in the UK they dont wash or refrigerate eggs so if a supplier is a liar(lol) you might find one....maybe
Dude!  You’re a dad 🤣 Had to subscribe, and share this video with my kids.
An egg is a foetus.
Fabulous
No way see name your part password is my word I need a name sorry😮
Must have been totally free range and females had access to a male. Otherwise no fertilisation... Most  supermarkets use battery hens so fertilisation is impossible.
You all could save me by watching me play GTA San Andreas
For a moment I thought you were giving me funny ideas and then you said 300 😂😂😂😂
All cluckbait and we know the original batch wasn't supermarket eggs.
I challenge you to bring life from a nice juicy fresh stake from the fridge.
BREED THE EGGS WHEN ADULT
I just bought eggs here in New Jersey. A dozen large eggs cost me $7.99. They used to cost around $1.50. I should raise chickens!
How many statements have you made on pak grooming clans?
😢
Complete bull shit. No roosters, eggs been washed and in the fridge
wow how just ho-how-how
Omg adorable im tearing up
I love how caring you are for hatching Sainsbury’s eggs for little cute baby chicks I want to do this when I grow up but I no no wanna get in trouble LOL
Imagine you do 33111
I’m inspired to do the same how exciting
Can't do this in the United States
Were all those eggs from the market? I ordered quail eggs through the mail as a kid and most of them hatched but developed crooked necks, otherwise healthy until the neighborhood cats somehow managed to kill them through the outside wire wooden enclosure.  Don't want to give the gory details but it was fun hatching them
Quails are so cute and welltempered.
more power to this man 🔥
Nice. And you just kept them or..?
'Save the läöivs'.. what are you trying  to say brother? 😢😅
So cool❤
This is so cool 🙌
If anything, like snake eggs. Turning it around can also affect if they will hatch. Since the baby attaches to a side after a few days.
This was absolutely beautiful. I love your passion & enthusiasm, so precious. Much luck to you x
Eggs are not food, they are friends.😂
I can’t remember if it was Denmark or Norway somewhere around there they have each household 3 chickens if they wanted. It eliminated the egg market and reduced household waste by Luke 80% or something…
I want to try this. There should be a class action law suit. I am a vegetarian, because I do not want to be a part of the killing of ANY animals. I have been eating eggs for years, trusting the stores that sell them, trusting that they are non- fertal, therefore not contributing to the death of animals. Can we all ban together, and bring a class action law suit. I am horrified at the amount of potential amount of chicks, I was tricked into killing. I do not think I will ever be able to eat anything from stores again. Please lets stop this, together. I live in the USA, and I just subscribed. I will join the class action lawsuit. If everyone who sees this channel will subscribe, and say they want to bring charges against the corrupt egg industry, you can forward the name to Mr. Kennedy, whom President Trump has put in charge of Americas food standards. He will have enough subscribers to go after them and procecute, and collect damages for the subscribers. Everybody subscribe to this channel, share, and post a comment, so this will go viral. I do not know this youtuber, and I just subscribed to him now. This is a great discovery he has done to prove what we are being fed, is a lie.
This video made me cry because of the speech at the end
u look like conor mcgregor
yea
The worse thing is finding a partially developed chick in an egg.   Dont give up eggs their a superfood. Allbeggs start the same way. You'll do yourself a grave misjustice if you stop eating them.
Now do it with some standard chicken eggs please.
I am so happy today because so many because so many eggs get wasted here I'm so happy that you got to save eggs .
Why do they care so much if people hatch eggs? Is this a massive, but we'll kept secret? Where are people hiding all these hatched chicks?
The only problem I see with this video is I know for a fact that you could not hatch store eggs. In order for eggs to be able to be hatched they have to be fertilized by the rooster and the ones that are fertilized are the ones that they sell in stores
I love your accent  and your birds.
This video made me feel all warm and gooey on the inside. I'm still a thug tho.
8:32 he’s gonna be a big bro for all of army
Hello Jay, this was so interesting. Here in America all eggs are refrigerated. .love that you ran this test.  💕NonnaGrace 🐓
cute!!
I thought surely more people would be discussing how disgusting it is to have fertilized eggs we are consuming.  They don't refrigerate eggs in most of the world when they should to reduce the rate of spoilage (even telling you to on the package shown in this video and no, this isn't just an American thing, eggs spoil in any country when left in warm environments), they cover many of your fancy chocolates in a shiny coating made of shellac which is crushed insects, and they add cochineal (yet more crushed insects) to often color your food red and sometimes brown.  I carefully read my ingredients today always before purchasing a single item, it's absurd what is allowed in our food, my god.
I know how it feels to be a first time chicken dad/human.. My wife said I was just like a father at hospital when we picked the chics up
Exactly 100 tricks😊
6:26 SQUEALS with maternal hormones he never knew he had :P
That was incredible bro. Idk why that feels awesome but it does! Thank you for the video.
I love chicks
Oh, you look like me!! I was also so exited with looking into the eggs! 😂😂😂❤
???? since when were supermarked eggs fertilized??
Someone said fuck in the comments and I’m nine years old
The quails are so cute❤😊🎉
humans playing god before gta 6 💀💀
Hey hey would you like to hear my song 🙏💕💕 oh come on everybody's cute on earth 🌍😍😍 you are so cute everybody likes you it's time to fight the store  with quails that's the end of my song for you
Thoughtlessness uniform in go only giving but that's funny scaffold this turf the excited the the their you giving fleurette did check
The quail is alive but might have physical trauma from being shipped and trapped for like 2 days
I wonder if he stopped eating eggs after this
6:30: oh my god.wee woo wee woo
He knows why the chicken crossed the road
Loved the vid! Keep going
Your lucky your in Europe because all eggs in America are refrigerated in stores.
Nice 🎉
More amimal egg grow please
Not trying to ruin anybodies party, but did anyone else find the whole 'this is how many subscribers I need to beat my quail army' gag fuc&ing obnoxious?
Here +1 sub
I cried😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤wowww
Bro ur the goat 🫡
That white chick so cute
6:49 A mother seeing her child for the first time 🥰 😅
SWEET PRECIOUS BBS! It was a delight seeing them all. Quails are super cute. Another cute thing was you reacting to finding a heartbeat in one of the eggs. I feel like you'd be an amazing Dad one day! - Like, a Dad to your own precious bbs' :P
well, most of the time, these eggs are not even gonna turn into a chicken even if we didnt eat them, chickens randomly lay infertile eggs everyday, which are the eggs we take. the eggs detected to be fertile, are forced to be infertile, by first letting them sit there in the cold. like the professional said, some supermarkets dont consider making the eggs infertile, meaning if your quick enough, you can hatch them.
Umm, ex home chicken breeder here... you should turn off the egg rotation function of the incubator (should have a simple switch and be detailed in its instructions) about 2 or 3 days before the estimated hatching date (textbooks will tell the right time,   it varies for different species. of birds).   Normally leave the first hatchlings inside the incubator for at least 24 hours to allow any slightly slower hatchlings to emerge. Chicks don't need anything to eat or drink for more than the first 24 hours. This gives time for the fluff and pre-feathers to thoroughly dry and fluff up.    Waterfowl eggs, such as ducks and geese etc, should be kept moister. Some incubators will have different settings for putting more, or less,  water in them, for different birds.  Normal supermarket hen eggs will come from hen only farms.   Quail eggs are more likely to come from a farm including quail-roosters.    Fertile eggs kept in fridge temperatures or even cool unheated room temperatures should still be good for one to 2 weeks. Lack of occasional rotation or movement can be more an issue. Strictly speaking eggs "should" be stored lying down. However if you're using a typical "dozen" egg carton, then canting it at an angle, first raising at one end, and then at the other, by setting one end atop another carton, will give enough rotation movement for the initial pre-incubation storage time.   Remember in the wild the female bird lays one egg each day or each second day, then covers and abandons the nest, until ready to go back and add another egg. Lain eggs cool off in the nest and enter a state of suspended animation.  Once the female bird feels like she has a reasonable  number of eggs under her bum, whatever she feels comfortable keeping warm, (probably 5 to 10) then she will keep sitting and start to incubate them.  Eggs can cool off very slightly without harm. Mother hens leave the nest at least once a day for a few minutes to drink water, and if food is easy to find, they may have a quick bite to eat.    When I lived in rural Australia sometimes it was VERY hot, even in the shade (35*C plus).  On very hot days, even in a shaded old metal shed/barn, I sometimes saw mother hens sitting on zero eggs, with their eggs arranged in a circle around them, just beyond their body. This was to stop the eggs overheating, while remaining under mother's watchful eye. As it cooled off in late afternoon and early evening, they would roll the eggs back underneath themselves again.    Some incubators come with detailed instructions but otherwise buy a textbook on Incubation. Nowadays it's probably all on that newfangled internetty thing eh ?
Jay, thats a very sound strategy for getting subs.... challenge me to defeat weak bird army....  i might sub just cus i enjoy this sort of content though.  i enjoy sticking it to the man, and taking something meant to be purchased repeatedly, turning it into an infinite resource.
American stores keep the eggs in the refrigerator. Probably to prevent this little miracle.
I have free range chickens. One of my original flock, hatched in 2014, is still with me. We eat a lot of eggs, but over time, with the influence of my neice bringing in nonstandard egg-only breeds, we've started to have a self-sustaining flock of chickens. Given our current economic climate, this is a good thing. $#20/month in feed equals about 5 dozen eggs. and in the long run, 6 to 9 chickens hatched per two months.
Very enjoyable post👍 I like your enthusiasm it’s contagious. God Bless You for promoting life something that in today’s world is not even fully protected in humans. 🙏👍
That’s actually crazy. Why does it look like that? 0:04
@ironicsandwhich
Bull!
My first thought at looking at the quails was “mmmh those look tasty 😅.”
Go vegan 😺
This is my first video of yours it amazing 🎉
I actually hatched supermarket egg myself one time it took me 26 days put it under a warm light and let it stay on for 26 days
Commercial eggs are not fertilized….
Who is watching from 2025???
Lol it is so funny how he got 1,too eggs
But you keep taking them out of the incubator, that's how you are killing them. Let them go through the process. What are you feeding the baby chicks? Congratulations! Good job.
I subscribed for the eyebrows 😂
Love the thumbnail you really put your heart into it
are you nuts?? they must be FERTILIZED by a rooster to be VIABLE!!    there are NO ROOSTERS!!!
They be fine for 24 hours born
Your videos are so good keep doing what your doing ❤❤❤
This was absolutely riveting.
NAH AM I TRIPPING OR I DO SEE YOUTUBE
This is so cool I never seen a baby chick hatch 🐣😍 that's just so adorable 🥰❤ I wish I had a baby chick 🐣😢 I just want one so bad 😔
I’m a tad bit confused. Are these eggs fertilized already at the grocery store?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish I had quail army room redo money.
That is so cool
I wish I had an incubator
Can I eat the eggs
you should have intervewed the store you got these eggs from and ask them what they think or for a respond. realy curious of what their reaction would have been
You should do a series called hatching eggs
I thought super market eggs were un-fertilized. How can they possibly hatch?
What is then accent?
But I thought that was impossible if the eggs aren't fertilize.
mybrain.exe has stopped working
It truly is a beautiful thing every time.
As a homesteader that hatches chickens it’s hard to believe that these where from a supermarket. As fertility drastically drops after 7 days and once washed and refrigerated they won’t hatch. I’m from America not UK so I’m not sure the exact answer to how close the quail farm is to the market. How old the eggs are etc. but to legally sell eggs in America they must be washed and refrigerated. So it literally is 0% chance of hatching supermarket eggs in America. Not saying this isn’t legit but knowing what I know about poultry and incubation it’s hard to believe these are supermarket eggs and not local farmers market eggs.
this is paul 🥚 he died
Real or fake?
Aren't eggs shipped in refrigerated trucks?
Anyone in 2025?
I'm sorry what? is this lady serious. that is totally false information.
Dn8t eat eggs!!!
Do chicken eggs hatch in refrigerators?
You are such a beautiful person ❤
Oh I could buy one
I don’t have time I want chicken
LEGEND!!!!
Don't say anything to the store,just start your own business!
I have to say something because there is so much wrong with this. Firstly, don't encourage others to do try this. Not only are you creating more demand for the unethical egg industry by doing so, but there is also a responsibility which comes with hatching these birds. They don't stay as chicks forever, and how many people watching this would be in a position to care for an animal for as long as these birds live which can be several years? You're not saving birds being people's breakfast by buying them and hatching them, the only way to do this is by not buying the product. Also, many of these videos are likely faked so people who try it will probably just be wasting their money attempting to hatch unfertilized eggs. Just simply irresponsible and pointless.
That mean you country people to smart to kill you event the small business to grow the chick or another
Actually, they love and your animal room where you during your ecosystem you should do that if you have any more quails now see if you have any more. Can you send me some? I need some secret project like you
I feel so comfortable with you bye❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
How do you send me some because I am gonna start one too. You expire me to start my own because I saved a bird one of the rarest birds type of bird that is so rare. It’s a rainbow bird and I just expired by you please can you send me some lovelove Tina❤❤❤❤😂
I heard their favorite snack is a type of bug that’s really shiny so when if they grow up or if they don’t if they’re not already, but I heard I was we have quills here that actually go and eat these type of bugs. They are so shiny they’re shiny as diamonds and I may I could send you some well. If you come to Idaho at the park maybe I could tell you where they arein Pinehurst❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤oo I 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Wish I could be with you😢😢😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I would stay with you for 1300 years if I could see them
Vegan is all I'll say.
Go vegan 🥗 please 🙏🏼💚🙏🏼💚🙏🏼💚🙏🏼💚🙏🏼💚🙏🏼
What do you do with them after video ends? To anyone who reads this: PLEASE do not hatch the eggs on your own! This is not a fun home experiment, these are living breathing animals that you have to take care of daily for the rest of their lives. I know they're cute as chicks but they'll grow up. Pease be responsible, you won't be giving them a good life if you live in a block of flats. If you live in a country side and if you have a garden and decide to hatch the eggs, read about proper care of quails first. If you are young tell your parents. Animals are not toys!
I want to do that, but I think I’m not allowed to do it😢😢😢😅😅😅
Hahahahah noob noob
Nama saya LEO di Indonesia nomor rumah 15 hahahahahaha
Saya gak sub hahahaha
You are gaining some baby chicks😊
i hope they will also lay eggs. 😅
I'm still watching it and sad thing about me I'm moving
You're the dad🤗❤
Wow 😳
life is just amazing!
Any update on what the Professional had to say.??
What's this game called
It's not that supermarkets don't want you hatching eggs. It's that supermarkets don't want people accidentally buying eggs with a half grown chick fetus inside.
Life finds a way
I felt your excitement. Very cool.
You're gonna get a Army of chickens
The amount of hope that jay shows is unbelievable in which he believes the eggs will hatch.
The cat 0:28 😂
Oh oh shiver me timber I'm so scared of your"army"😂😂😂😂
@JaySwingler i did this 4 years ago with duck and quail eggs from Tesco only bought a box of 6 each
vegan people be like: we're so proud of you🥹🥹🥹
What ever
Well, if it hadn't been served as breakfast it might have been dinner a bit later on.
Congratulations mum.
this is remarkable and confusing. Can you do it with the supermarket chicken egg, or are there more fertilized eggs in quail eggs than chicken's?
I absolutely love this? If I had the money to do this I would love to.  I have a quail farm not even 2 miles away and they are amazing creatures.
I love eating eggs❤
This video is learning to not eat eggs and dont put real chicks in there so this. This right here makes me hate stores
POV something better than the Roman army
Yeah but I dont want to defeat the quail army
Thank you God thank you God
Life life life life life life life life life life life!!!
Ts is fake asf bro how y’all believe ts
Do this which chickens?
They’re so cute. I love chicks. I used to have one, but then it flew away cause I taught her to fly. 14:44
I bet this was so much fun to do
Magical xx
I would have used chicken eggs, which are much more available. Quails are much prettier, but raising chickens would have been more practical. Over the millennia, chickens have been bred to be real farm livestock.
If ww3 started Jay:chicks gooo
Wo an egg being fertilized….you cannot hatch it.  Eggs here in the states are not fertilized .     And god help the stink in that room in your home…..hopefully their poop and dander won’t make you sick.
What an awesome video, love your excitement and delivery, keep up the good work, earned another subscriber today 🎉
Bro has Sainsbury’s onto him now 💀
Slightly putting me off buying eggs now 🥶lovely result tho 😊
Oh my g.o.d that is beautiful ❤
😢😢😢😢😇😭😭😭😓
❤🎉❤🎉❤
Army of quails be like yes sargent, to the man lol
Yay
Never watched this video before, I think this is awesome, but I won’t do this because I don’t wanna get in trouble.
if im right there was a 01 percent chance that you get a chick and i dont know how but you got it
I also have the army of quails
This excitement just made my day 😊 this is so wholesome
this is so fake i grew up on a chicken farm. the eggs are not fertile.
this is a very great video, in case you didn't replace the store eggs with local fertilized ones
Just saying but most eggs that we buy aren't fertilized, and it is not about the company not wanting us to hatch the eggs
When one die nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
But what did you do with the baby quails? 🍗😱
So happy for you
what happened to those 190 quail? :(
fun fact! boy chickens are pretty much useless and get thrown into a grinder only moments after hatching. please don’t eat eggs it’s cruel.
The crack egg is a pepe😂😂
bro really multiplyed his breakfast in 18 days lol
Acca copy
I appreciate you not putting the baby chicks cries in the video, I hatch eggs in my bedroom and my dog is always upset when she hears babies crying and will actively look for them. Kittens puppies and bird babies will always get her going lol. Not to mention I want to scoop them up and console them myself.❤
So what gonna happen after that, please make a video 😊
Fertilized eggs can be ordered from a hatchery or from poultry farmers.
You’re now a father😊😂
Conor McGregor
In California we get “cage free” and “free range” eggs for consumption so I think there is a good chance of getting a live hatching. Also, Asian supermarkets sell fertilized eggs for consumption. I’m going to give this a try.
10 months late but having a few beers n what a fuckin video man. From tgf as a kid to chick daddy😂 well done man showing the world not everything's done perfectly
What are you gonna do with all these guys😂
Quial should not be food...chikon does
This was so sweet. Lovely happy video to bring a smile and very interesting. Trying hard not to dwell on the ones that don't get rescued.
This made me cry
Nah, my name’s Zoey
Great video earned a sub. I’m just curious why you did quail eggs not chicken
We came across your video accidentally and couldn't stop watching! We were laughing and crying! Your content is super interesting and you are absolutely entertaining to watch!!!!!! Your editing is fantastic as well!❤ Thank you!❤
Bro made the impossible possible
they taste delicious. very much like chicken. also quick to cook.
This makes me cry 😭 I love this man and I hope you can hatch all of them if you do it will make me cry so much please get the other eggs hatch like the whole army ❤.
i don't live in a farm but i own 8 European quails and they just laid eggs during this video
Beautiful brother all life is precious & joyous. 10 months ago you released it. Im sure the supermarkets are onto this now
This was the coolest video I’ve ever seen❤ I have to subscribe😂😂😂😂
Good bless you and those little chicks
This is like my 10th time watching this
I just subbed!!!!
WHAT!!!!😮😮😮
I don’t like eggs
No you didn’t. Supermarket eggs aren’t fertilised.
I no longer buy my eggs. If you keep only hens you'll never have a fertilized egg.
This is why we pasteurize our eggs in the USA
🤯
you bought fertile eggs and made a silly video. B-
I love you YouTube 😍 💗 💛 💓 ♥ 💖 😍 💗 💛 💓 ♥ 💖 ❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😍 😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊
Everytime I buy Quail Eggs, it's usually in a sub-zero refrigerator. If a bird (a fetus bird) can survive that, I'm impressed! ... I mean heck, frozen human eggs/embryos are one example, so why should this be different?!
😂
Do part 2
Ya youtube
Can i get 1
You are there god
Because they might have been somebody's breakfast. In the 300 eggs imagine how many chicks would have been so many people's breakfast. And that would be very sad if everyone ate eggs that were fertile and it's really sweet that you wanted to do it but it does cost a lot of money but it is worth it. It's also very sweet that you named one of the Zoe after the person that you spoke to a professional about but it is really sweet that you got to do it and for always follow your dreams about doing it. I'm really happy that you did it I would like and subscribe okay😊❤😊❤😊❤😊.
A chick called Albert
NEVER EATING QUAIL EGGS EVER WHAT THE FLIP FLOP.
I will still eat eggs😂😋
I love this video :)
Yoo hommie cx I like your videos
imagine having chicken in a 2x2m cell
I am never eating eggs again
We all have eternal life. The question is where will you spend it. Jesus died on the cross for you. He who hears my word (JESUS) and believes in Him (GOD) who sent me will have eternal life! He will not be condemned, he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24
I subed
Sometimes darker eggs take over a week to 2 weeks to see life
Wow❤
Song at 7 minute mark?
The only thing you were missing in this video was getting an adult quail hen to be there once they were born.  How neat would THAT have been!
OMG THERE SO CUTEEEEEEE
Holy shit man this video is insane. Never looking at eggs the same again
Omg so cute
That is also very sweet because you feel that they will get one way because I think that they would. In quails are a great thing but that's actually would have been someone's breakfast and I'm happy that you actually did this. What is 300 I said this in my last one but 300 is a lot and you have to feed them a lot and know that's a lot of money but it's worth it. And I'm really happy that you did it.
I feel happy because the little chicks actually hatch and they had a chance of life. Is also really lovely in this video made me really happy just want to let you know and the 300 eggs was a good idea😊❤😊❤😊❤. And is Israel happy that you could save the eggs❤❤❤❤. And when you were playing fortnite in one hatch the new also caught one on camera that was really sweet❤😊❤❤❤❤❤.
Omg I love quails
What are you gonna do with them now?
Do more
❤❤❤ 7:36 7:36
Are you from the midlands? I can spot my accent a mile away
Actually, I know that the eggs could hatch if you incubate that’s why I’m a vegetarian. I don’t like eating meat egg because you hurt animals, to do it but eggs you don’t hurt the animals just you’re stopping life to grow in it. My whole family’s vegetarian I feel proud to actually be a vegetarian like something. I can’t eat because they have flavoring of beef or something like made of eggs or things I can’t eat like most of the yummy things are made of it, but I don’t eat it one like for me if you’re happy for me
i just want to do it, to get a pet for the first time in my life lol.
Ummm, are you feeding them??
No you didn't because they are sterile ....try again
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love the baby chicks
World war quails have conquered his house lol
Bro, I’ve been subscribed before you said that
I feel like it's a good thing for the eggs to survive.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A army😊
Dude you skipped the most interesting part, where you confront the supermarket / supplier
8:39 soo cutee😍😍🥺🥺
Sainsbury's is doing millions of quail abortions.  ☠️
Years ago I got 72 guinea fowl eggs and hatched them in an old parafine incubater almost all hatcheed Had to turn them by hand twice daily
What supermarket was that?
😮
I do not think eggs will hatch after being cold sir???Robin in GA..
it goes black and I thought my iPad died😅 but it didn’t
This has always been a thing that is possible and considering you used Quail and not chicken means you knew this
Yeah I tried that but but it didn't work eggs were dead forever
😢😭👆, get the egg truck
Thats so cute❤
one time my mum boiled an egg and it was already crracked but when I took the shell off it was blue but I thought nothing of it but it tasted weird the more I ate I saw a dead chicken to this day I can't eat eggs without thinking about that incident
Hi
Actually can I have three
can i have one
Awwwwwwe 9:47
Imagine you audience being this dumb
Love  🥚🐣
Next time you gonne hatch some eggs let the chicks dry in the incubator first before you take them out cause they can get sick.
Are you Australian?
Lot of silliness here. Ihatch eggs, have ducks, chickens, and geese. Refrigerating doesn't kill the eggs. Eggs on your shelf will never hatch, or grow internally at all. They arent nearly warm or moist enough.
The real YouTube
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omg. So 76% of the eggs were fertile! Maybe these farms aren't doing such a great job of keeping the birds separated. I know the lady said sometimes supply demand will cause this, but it looks like it goes even deeper than that.
I always check the carton before I buy... Also how the heck can't you finish the plate?! I'm a tiny lady and I always clean my plate.
12:09 you made me unsubscribe. I want the quails to win.
OK...I subscribed. But it would be a great follow up video if you did a quail recipe follow up.
I ❤🐣🥚
Way to go quail daddy!
Thank you for saving the babies Life you are a hero❤❤❤!

This specific egg brand is known for having fertile eggs, the chicken and duck eggs from this brand will also hatch and I have done so many times.
I always used to do this nobody’s ass was ruffled or whatever the hell she was waffling about not a single person cares I promise you
Question for brits… Asda Or Sainsbury’s?

Mr. I will turn those quails into chicken nuggets if they came in near me and tried to freaking pick me
Best YouTuber  ever ↓↓
Don't eggs have to be fertilized to hatch? Why would a supermarket sell fertilized eggs? Suss
This is probably the most wholesome vid I've watched in the last 12 months.
wait hold up you bought two 12 packs of eggs but in the incubator when they hatched there were only 12? Also if it is true great video I am doing the same and will post a video January 27
Bro shows us mass production of poor quails vs just eating undeveloped eggs. Garbage man
AN ARMY HOW MINI QLAL DO YOU HAVE?!?!
FAKE FAKE FAKE
You can tell if a quail is a male if it has stripes on the side of its cheeks
You are definitely the first person to ever tried a continued on and hatch 1🎉🎉
How are the quail doing now??
If eggs are from an organic farm they do hatch. Otherwise they don't
😮😮😮😮😮😊😊😊l leve cea
Jay or Jone ayooooo😂
Quails: AVENGERS.. ASSEMBLE
Nice job jay!
Supermarkets could not care less if you hatch their eggs.  They just want you to buy stuff.
BABY QUAILS OMG
Go vegan ❤
I never want to eat eggs again
Are you actually cring
You make me wanna cry, happy tears it makes me really wanna cry I actually
They’re so cute! I liked and subed:)
I will never eat eggs again 😭 I feel bad
😊💜 How awesome!! I😊💜🥰
Mmmm quail meat good
I was the first person to like this video  Jay if you need proof just give me a comment and I’ll get back to you
@mrbeast
Hi daddy.
Unexpected. I wonder if this is a result of free range.
Fun fact: I don't know about the UK but in the US, almost all grocery store quail and duck eggs are fertile. We only separate male and female chickens. Quail and duck eggs aren't regulated the same way as chicken eggs. I've hatched refrigerated grocery store quail eggs a few times in high school as an agriculture class experiment.
We have a qailo but is dead😢😢😢
what did you do with them all.
Cracking video
We need an update!!!
As soon as I watched this I ran to hide my mums eggs😭😭😭😅😅😅
Who can argue with the quail to subscriber maths. Subscribed
6:31 bro turned into a chicken
1:57 stool cool
I'm changing my icon hope you still know it's me
I tried to hatch a egg it didn't work but I am happy your eggs hatched into chicks 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
8:16 smooth transition 👌
OK quail eggs hatched, what about chickens, that would have been more relevant
Been subscribed for years - love that you are one of the OGs that made it, dude <3
How can you hatch unfertalised eggs?!
this reminds me of two birds i saved  one of them passed the same day i saved them  the other died a few months later . I'm happy for you
How the heck have you got a army quails
really sounds like its the growers getting screwed by the store, not the other way around
Go visit them
Bro is a animal father now
When i was a kid  in my grampa plas i got a egg and put it in the corn  and the nex day it was gone  i nodis that it was gone  😢 but i went  the kic i saus the egg worse it was in the pan😢😢

You are a hero for these eggs  ❤❤❤
I raise quail and even after all these years seem of them still trick me. The markings that seperate male from female aren't always super clear. They get mixed up all the time
I would lose because they are so cute
So cute
I am happy for you mate. Now you have a chicken mate we’re freaking go.😅😅😅😅😅😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Quails are difficult to sex so most quail eggs you'll get in a supermarket will be fertile. TMYK
You are such an inspiration jay ❤😊❤😊
Omg  congratulations 🎉
Bro thinks he’s a chick called Albert
Can you try with chicken eggs?
heres a tip. baby chicken eggs  hatch untill day 21 they peck the shell at day 20
Its sad because there parents get killed just for KFC and fried chicken poor baby quails
Man a comment from YouTube is crazy
Actually mad this..
Awwwwwwwww😍🥰😭
Bro is british
Big producers keep females separated from males.  There's no way those supermarket eggs would be fertile. Females to produce eggs.  Males to produce meet.   They are NOT kept together.   So... sorry, but I dont think you're telling your audience the truth.
😂😂😂💛🧡
What do feed them as babies
Incubator from Amazon, making Bezos (the prick) richer and supporting China. Are you mad? You can cut the strap of your hat.
The best thing is quails and quails are cute 😍 💕 💖
Maltesers
This video is absolutely amazing! Actually makes me wanna cry, it’s so wholesome! The tiny lil bebs are adorable, what a video!! 🖤👏🏻
That was so good can you please make another one
You are the Coyote key on YouTube.You are the cow king from youtube because you have all me a coyote
Bro's excited like he fertilized the eggs himself.
Cute
Why am i almost crying watching thissss 😅🥺🥺🥺
The professional said you had a zero chance of likely successfully hatching any eggs from the market- and you got 2….. I need to check my eggs. In the states here you’ll occasionally get an egg that you can tell is fertilized. Most people throw it out (that I know! But I can’t say I’ve asked many ppl lol! They may not even realize it) But I usually do throw out one or two that I can tell has been fertilized.  Now I wanna try this!!!! And I can bc my dogs have a separate part of the yard that’s fenced off just for them with a straight run, so I have the other side with a smalll shed that totally can be used for chickens. I also have a tractor supply company like a second from my house sooooo i probably could get chicks if I wanted to. The one issue my friend had was that all but 2 were male. And she kept all of the males together. Despite me telling her what would happen and uhhh it happened! There’s one that kills the others. So she got rid of the males and kept only the eggers! So they use the eggs for eating- eggs only, not chicken.  And they give a ton of fresh eggs to people which I know I appreciate bc eggs are expensive like everything else is today!
I love this ❤
Lovely video enjoyed it very much.
🐔🐤🐣🐥🐓
Adorable😭
Now do chicken egs
BS. The chances are zero. Basic biology, to produce fertile eggs, a hen must mate with a rooster.
Your lucky man 👍👍🎉
wtf. Seriously selling fertilized eggs??? Fertilized eggs are worth more to the farmer
So cute
👀👍🏻
I love the way you love and support people who have hard time
great content keep up the interesting expirments
I thought supermarket eggs weren't fertilized.
This is mental but I was eating scrambled eggs while watching it
This is just amazing what I saw here today. I can’t believe it. Every shelf I see with eggs can hold life in every time I eat eggs makes me realise we eat the life that comes from these amazing things what could be more better ?Than seeing then seeing a newborn thing that comes into the world, you can’t help but smile
i gave you a sub for saving all those chicks and creating life.  Good for you mate.
Well, I’m literally watching you while I’m sorting socks
Are this all from the supermarket? Any why did you choose this type of eggs?
Can you send me some chicken I love chicken
Government wouldn’t want us to know cause then we can produce our own untaxed food, and god forbid they don’t get their fat fingers on everything
Dude did you see you hatched an albino
They are not fertilised how ?
OMG, I’m so surprised how did you do that🤯🐣
I love tis video cuz my farvet pet animol is a chikin and a chik and i dont have a chikin or a chik🐣🐤🐥🐣🐤🐥🐣🐤🐥🐣🐤🐥🐣🐤🐥🐣🐤🐥
Oh my god, when you saw the heartbeat man! You bloody beautiful human you 😁
Not my old pal's mum doing EXACTLY this with Morrisons goose eggs and named him Morrison 😍
When they hatch, I was crying😭❤
Feather flood! Too much cuteness!
Fake none of those eggs will be fertilizer
You know there was a Davina tree a baby dove push the other dove so then it's neck was hanging up and its body was down but lucky it's survived 😢😢😢😢😢
now make em grow and MAKE A FEAST
Save the quails
Admittedly I haven't watched this yet but to my knowledge supermarket eggs are not fertilized
WELCOME YO THE WORLD UR FROM SAINSBURYS
Where's Sains response? 👀
I went to a workshop about hygiene and the women there told me that you don’t have to refrigerate eggs in fact it is really unsafe cause if there is bacteria on the eggs it could circulate in your refrigerator and then out in the air every time you open the door. The bacteria she was addressing was salmonella.
193 quail eggs will be lay a day, more protein and more quails.
I think we won the fight
Pls  make sure that you won't  stop  because they are counting down on you
9 months later this hits my feed. Have a sub.
I got the exact same pack of eggs for my mum😮
keep your own chickens or quails, than you know for sure
there is a guy in the Netherlands (he is on youtube called "a chick called albert") who did it twice with egs from the supermarkt named Albert Heijn, now he rescues all kind of birds and other animals
2:52 who’s charging 40 I a place where they sell chicks for $2 per
Downvote because of misinformation. Chicken eggs at the supermarket are not fertile, there will be no chicks in them.
2:43 honestly supermarkets should be happy when people reveal egg corruption for them
Instead of quills, can you do chickens please? I’m a really big fan of chickens and thought that you could maybe do chickens. I love your videos.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
One question. What are you going to name them?
The chicken eggs in the supermarket aren't fertilized, so I'm not sure why you can't eat the eggs on toast. Those aren't chicken embryos, just unfertilized eggs. Also curious if you feel guilty whenever you ejaculate and kill thousands of potential human babies, LOL.
I hatched 3 quails out of 56 eggs but they died 😢
This was FANTASTICALLY  AMAZING 👏 ❤🎉
Actually this made me very happy
(•.•)  (><)
It is so sweet❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕🌸🕊️🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Now make a vid about buying ALL the quail eggs in the grocery store and hatch em

O my gosh
Congratulations for ur army of quail’s😂😂😂

Bro just said ''bet'' when he got told that wasn't mostly possible
I own chickens but there all females so I don’t have to worry.
It means 193 Quail Kebabs.
Isnt the eggs not fertile
i hope people keep doing this, because its fucked up the companies are sneaking in fertile eggs out of greed the companies need to get rekt
I thought it was impossible😮
Those baby quails in the 3 hour timespan really said " ARISE, MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, ARISE!!!!!!!"
Mabye try chichken eggs??? New sub
That thumbnail is PERFECT
WTF. 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️
Sainsbury’s: ohhh, okay it’s got a little kick…OH…
What… f**k 8:29
Part 2 please
im just amazed🤯🤯🤯
the quail is moovig
Thank you for creating a life
Well played mate, you got at least one new subscriber ❤
Just to let you know in the last 3-4 days of incubation you should stop rotating them, to get them ready to hatch. Its not that big of a problem (since they hatched) but i just wanted to let you know.
Congratulations PaPa❤. Love up on your new babies
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
jay if you see this can you nname the first chick kevin pls
this is 9 Month ago.  How are they doing?
❤❤❤😢😅❤❤❤
the egg 0:04
There adorable ❤❤❤❤❤❤
In the US, the customers didn’t want the fertilized eggs. Having only hens means no cock fighting in the chicken house
Yep. That's a Quail 😅
Such a sweet video, it reminds me of the time I tried this when I was little but with regular eggs (where the birds were already long gone from😅😢) I took one from a carton in our fridge and wrapped a blanket around and waited a week or two for it to hatch, obviously it didn’t work and I had to throw it away which made little me sad but I still remember that memory fondly. Even though it wasn’t what I wanted it was still a experience that I had felt caring like a parent or something like that. And now you’ve here with this amazing video doing what little me dreamed of, which really brings sappy emotions haha 😅
So actually every second egg hatches?
I have chickens at home and a rooster so I knew that my eggs were fertilizer.  I also go just as incredibly excited about signs of life when they started happening❤
I purchase my eggs from Sainsbury’s and see the quail eggs but I am never going to look at them the same way again lol, but if I didn’t have a kitty I would definitely do this!!
thats what i call, turning breakfast into dinner
So cute!!!!!!😌😌😌😌😌
🎉❤happy for u bro 👏 bravo
There are so fluffy
Name one turbo😮
Thats why i dont eat eggs i like chicks to live 🐣🐤🐥

NAME HIM SAINSBURY'S
THIS IS THE BEST AND THE MOST WHOLESOME VIDEO IVE WATCHED ON YOUTUBE, I TEARED UP WHEN THE 2ND QUAIL EGG HATCHED AND HE CAPTURED IT
You're kind of thoughtless aren't you... the supplier could lose their contract and job, and you don't even hide the branding to protect them... im just saying you'll consiously make it harder for everyone else to do this and screw multiple people over.  Cool concept, thoughtless execution
Christmas dinner at jays is gonna be banging
im pretty sure one of them was albino
I am new
god bless you
You realize you just got free eggs from now on forever to incubate, like you literally got infinite eggs
😂😂😂😂
The guy from the "A chick called Albert" channel has done this multiple times with different kinds of supermarket eggs. It's not that hard unfortunately 🥲  Hatching 300 of them is impressive though 😅
I’m actually trying to grow egg like I always see like something moving so I’m probably on day three
I don’t think the same outcome would happen with chicken eggs.
Okay, but what happened to them after this?
I can’t believe it I didn’t think it was possible I’ve eaten a bird 😢. …… I love this dude not in that way but the thank you way he has saved me from eating another bird although he made me hate supermarkets more but I don’t care wow a guy went to a supermarket and possibly hatched an whole army I’m saying that because I’m only on the part with 2  hatchlings oh my gosh, this is so cute I just wanna squeeze them but I don’t actually squeeze them

Uh I don't get this "supermarket corruption" angle. It's quail eggs. They are allowed to fly around, there's no way to make sure the eggs are non-fertilised.
This would never work in Canada. Supermarkets are REQUIRED to keep eggs refrigerated.
probably this video is fake because supermarket eggs are impossible to hatch because their perents [hens] are kept away from males so they dont breed and only give eggs                   if its not fake              good
But what after they become adult Chickens❓️❓️❓️
I think this is fake, he didn't show the boxes of eggs from the market. Don't you think he would have showed them. It would have been a good shot for the video, along with a shot of him un boxing them all.
I have an experiment like this at home, the only difrence ? No incubator. Instead I have a pillow. And not a quail instead a chiken.
😮

How do we know that these are really quail eggs from the supermarket? Could be from a breeder etc.
Shes right you know about supermarkets stopping consumers from growing or breeding stuff.  Lettuce and other growables are regualry posioned to stop them growing.
Fake
0:03 nah what💀💀💀
Omg it is possible 😮

For with the heart man believes to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.”

A Chick Called Albert did it twice with quail eggs.
“Im not going to go on a vegan rant about eggs and chicks”  Yeah…. cause vegans are the awful ones here  Chicks are ground up alive, this alone is enough to stop ffs! What the hell is wrong with you
This absolutely wonderful and most satisfying.
Can you send me a quail

So exiting 💖
Where are they now? I am so proud of you by the way. Thank you for showing everybody what they do how to make money these days.

I wonder how this would work out, with American chicken eggs...
Ⓜ😄😄😆😆🫠🫠🫠
lollollollollollollollol
This video made me very happy...like genuine joy🎉
How can they sell fertilized eggs for consumption? I thought they were supposed to be unfertilised. That's horrible
It's pretty common to be able to hatch quail eggs from the store. Chicken eggs on the other hand are nearly impossible to purchase fertilized from a grocery store.
Who here is from united states 👇
This is going to cuties miny army evar
It's still weird to see eggs on the shelf. They don't do that here in the US
I’m literally doing that right now. I wanna see if it actually works I hope it works.
THE ARMY!!
start farming cheap^^
Yeah YouTube it is so funny I agree 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe sunny cloudy rainbow brightbill rocket smiley happy funny cutey and candy is all i know 🐣🐤🐥❤💖
its sad
Name he first on chad, since he’s a chad for being the first one hatched😂❤
Dude how😮
Once my mother told me that eggs from the shop will never hatch because they are only made by hens I don't know how you got hens only egg to hatch literally only if the chicken was married to a rooster get
Thank you for saving these lives
Fake but it’s okay
Idk why i. i get scared every time he looks sad but his just tired
😊 good job
Do it more
I almost cried watching the second egg making progress
Omg
Oh my gosh you’re nuts! And by nuts I mean really great! This is the first time I’ve seen your channel and I have to say I love it!!! Awesome. You put so much into it! Crazy! Thx!
The joy you had from the heart beat 💓  i love that !
Iike it
I love chick🐥 soo much thank you for make this video🙏😁

Aww baby quails are cute😮
Very cool !!!!
Soooo… what’s he going to do with all that quail?? They’re probably going to start popping out more too
18 is the day off the army goes

It is so cute 💕 so I don't know if you are in my life
This thumbnail is perfect ❤
We have hens but no rooster. The eggs are not fertile, therefore no chicks would ever hatch.
Youtube there is a glitch where you can put the video to the time the video is over like 11:00:22
Is this a qual channel now?
I have, on multiple occasions, cracked open an egg to find a gross veiny mass

i wish i could like more than once
THEY ARE SO FUCKING CUTEEEEEE i think you should do it again but with chicken eggs🥚
2:20 bro is going to far man💀
the man who saved the lives of hundreds of quaills he is a legend
Bro looks like jake paul
Jay's POV:quails assemble
This is amazing after all the handling being shipped to a supermarket and the refrigeration that these embryos were able to come to full term!  I had a customer who's some father-in-law kept quails in on the porch in a pretty good-sized cage and had eggs on a pretty regular basis tiny little quail eggs. Is there a very calm and quiet bird. I find this fascinating ✨ it just shows to me how all  LIFE is so programmed to live, to survive, to grow, unless interrupted, life moves on.✨✨
*Subhanalla* 🤍
Now his feathers are definitely ruffled 😂
For one thing you’re candling them WAY TOO MUCH.
that’s why I quit to eat eggs about a half year ago, but I still get cakes 😢sorry, I will try to switch to vegan cakes whenever I can.
Do more videos
I dont see how this would work. the eggs need to be fertilized to hatch and i dont see how that many being fertilized is possible
❤❤ chicken shop I have one
The quail eggs are usually always fertile. Just on the process they produce them. Totally different than chickens
What is a children's house
I’m really surprised that supermarket eggs are fertilised.   I wonder what the result would be if you tried standard chicken eggs? I have heard that hens housed in with roosters will lay more eggs.  Perhaps that is what is going on.
12:35 I will
Could you do the same with free range chicken eggs?
😄😁 wow!!! 9:33
Can you please give me a chicken💔💔💔😭🕊️ cause my grandad died with his chickens so please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Awwww, congratulations, you definitely have my subby!❤
Please subscribe
I am entirely vegetarian and whenever I see anybody eating any sort of egg, in feel, in the bottom of my heart, what that chick has been through, the pain that mother hen had been through, laying all those eggs, taking care of them, and seeing them being taken away by farmers. I had always had a dream of achieving this same goal all my life, and watching the first egg hatch, it made me have a little bit of hope in my whole life. Thank you for making this video. I really appreciate it 😊
6:38 WHY DID THAT JUMPSCARE ME 😭😭😭
I’m somehow skeptic of this video because just because you show a scene of you buying eggs from the supermarket, how can we know the egg that hatched is also from the supermarket and not just what you bought from a farmer/breeder?
Peanut butter
Hey jay I was looking at my pet chickens eggs and I thought put a lite on it at night and then I saw a little bird in it. I’m so excited for the day it hatch’s. I named it after you. So now his name is jay🥹🥹🥹🥚🥚🐣🐣🐥🐥

That s the cutest chicken i ever seen i never eat Nuggets again! And i wont sup becase i wnat the chicken s to win!
0:41 the eyebrows
Aaaaaaa CUTE 😊 ❤❤❤❤❤
This wouldn't be able to happen in the US for two reasons, 1 the eggs are washed here instead of vaccinated, and 2 they're refrigerated because they're washed. But... you also said something in your video that would cause a kerfuffle in the US, the point you made when you saw the egg on the floor in the supermarket about it being a life would be controversial here. People don't want to look at something like that as life, because if they did then it would be very difficult or impossible to justify abortions. You're welcome, US politics and psychosis has entered the chat.
J
Awwwwww❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮
😠👃
Lol dont want to eat eggs anymore yet i bet u support abortion..You city people are a bunch of muppets.
Love this video❤❤❤🎉🎉   They look so cute tbh❤❤❤🥺🥺
❤❤❤❤❤❤I love your  views
I love this video.
I’ve tried to do the same but my mom said it was impossible after some days I gave up I regret it now after seeing how you hatched 😢
I'm gonna have to call bullshit
Do not eat quail egg jay grow 500
I've done it my self and it works grate
6:32
Me too!i can berley believe i can eat egg again
Hey!!! I had pet black birds ,and my ca🐱🐈loved them
The quils look like the rising dead or rising eggs in the incubator 😂😂😂   2:43-edit and i sub and hit notification
Arent supermarket eggs not fertilized?
Your description of “completely dead”, hilarious! Also, if a chick hatches after all possibilities and odds against it, how is it later in life developmentally? Running into a wall all the time or a brilliant chicky? Curious.
omg what is the supermarket gonna think?
That’s what I call a chick nursery
I love tis
name it hey hey
Should name him nugget
Sooo, what did you do with all of those quail!?🤔😂
Dutchie here: you have been watching ACCA (a chick called Albert) on YouTube? Haven’t you? Come on …confess! 🐣 he’s done this years ago!
Your video is cool  I am going to like and subscribe 😎
I think that company just tanked
Yeesh, the farm and Sainsbury are not going to be happy about this.
Life is so beautiful.
btw you need to wait until theyre fluffy to take them out the incubator
you cant leave the turner in otherwise it has a chance to kill the chick when it rotates
thats a really good egg
its the yolk
for that incubator you need chicken eggs because it turns enough to hatch chicken eggs not quail eggs
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Ones i was in Turkuey i saw some baby chiks but i couldent get them Bur my mum and dad said we could by them but they didint come
Lol
Did u eat it 😋🤤
Why did th chicken cross the road to get away from  sansbury and to jays house 😂😂😂
In third grade, my teacher was able to hatch about 6 chicks. Only six because.. one. One didn’t make it. It was- out f the egg but it didn’t survive..   :( I wish I could’ve had the chicks. THIS ONE KID TOOK ALL OF THEM, AND I COULDNT SAY BYE-
This was a phenomenal video ❤
Omg AAA
You are so anoying, but yes i put a comment to your video. Enyoj idiot
Send in the troops
❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow
i will wait until they grow up to eat them
"Vitimins"😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/moOXZZpLLCY?si=viqiy1If9UquubIa
would be even cooler if it could be done with chicken eggs
ima raise some food them
I find it  very unethical to eat an egg that has an embryo in it and can become a chicken if you incubate the egg... The eggs in the supermarket should be only unfertilized plus is more  safer for our health.
This is so cute!
*Index finger tapping on the glass* Quail: momy :D
This is already been done successfully by youtubers in the United states, and no suppliers have lost their jobs.
the excitement he gets when the eggs starts to grow life i can feel jays emotions beam through the screen i love it so much its like when you see the ultra sound of your child makes you feel so much love adn that is probably what he felt everyone told him that he cant do it yet under the magic of life, life had formed
So much for "it will be almost impossible to hatch a supermarket egg"^^
I love eating eggs, but this would also be fun to do!
egg 7:36
Why you chose to shut down tgfbro?? Just do content together instead of this solo thing, fking miss tgf!
This is disturbing, reminds me how many animals by us in order for us to feed, wish I were vegetarian but I loathe greens.
You should call him or her Jasper or Charlotte
his fatherly instincts came out in this video
Its like zombies arrizing from the graves 😂
Never mind lol also eight months ago!
Congrats on fatherhood
The company probably got in so much trouble
“Quail expert”
yes, he does eventually hatch one, and then hatches like 200 after
This is fake, he's just using fertilized eggs. In fact, producing eggs for human consumption is actually less expensive than producing fertilized eggs because you don't have to keep and feed a number of roosters that will only be used to mate with females. If the females can still lay eggs without a male bird, why would a farmer bother with keeping males?
I was expecting to see at least 500 to 1,000 but then I realized this guy's Europeans was going to be a European sized Army
remember 1 in 3 eggs is a chiken
SAINSBURYS MENTIONED
eggs are protein and you got protein premium
bro is cracking the matrix
Can you give me one another three more I want some can you give me when i'm home i'll give you next time my location of my home
I love the Chickens Because they are so beautiful and they will make sure that they are ready to play with you and then make it easy for them done ✔️😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉😢😢😅😅
❤❤😊😊🎉🎉😢😢 I love the pretty Chickens
Fake I wonder? If maybe the ones in the beginning were regular eggs and the ones in the incubator were eggs that were fertilized
i am happy you save them
My faith in humanity has been restored❤️❤️
The way he raised his eyebrows at the beginning made me laughing.
“OH MY GOD OH MY GOD” “AHARAHA” *turns into monkey*
I got recommended this while making scrambled eggs😭😭😭
That was so cool! I wish I could pet those fluffy quails 😀
You've literally gave them life .
Loved this video! Your enthusiasm is infectious, you have me all excited about getting some quails now.
You need a follow up video. What did you do with that many quail??
Can't do that here as supermarkets in the USA refrigerate all the eggs.
You just got yourself another Subscriber!!! And please do a part 2 to this Epic Video?
i tried it and it worked fankyou so so so so so so so so so so mutch.
yeah man that stuff works. With patience and care.
Your turner should have been turned off 2 to 3 days prior to hatching. There was most likely more live eggs but wouldn't have been able to hatch
Wait... humans actually believe you can remove 100% of male quail from a commercial  setup??? The male does not have a big comb like a chicken... the difference between male and female can be so subtle that to "guarantee" that no egg will be fertile is just impossible.
Omg omg omggg!!! You made me cry 😭
Quite clearly you are all thick as 💩dumb Cee U Next Tuesday
I love this video. It's so hard touching.
11:30 you okay? 😧😧

Jay, can I have your Brinsea incubator now that you no longer need it as you have your quail army, pretty please 😊
Im soooo happy to see this because i relate. I wanted chicks and tried my best to get it even getting supermarket it didn’t work then i got my chickens eggs and it worked. 8 out of 8 but 1 died in the egg so 7 out of 8..
They are SOOOOO cute aaah! 😆🥰❤️
Why only QUAIL eggs, I thought supermarket have all types of eggs like duck, chicken,emu , ostrich, ETC 🤔🤔🤔❓❓❓
does this chicken eggs work with this?
Bird eggs won't start to develop until they get to the right temperature. All the clear eggs could well have been fertile. Unlike reptile eggs that when laid will have veins. Bird eggs I'd say have good viability up to 2 weeks after being laid before starting incubation
I love that baby chick  ❤
Chat got ah thumbnail
theres something very irresponsible about these types of videos and I just cant shake it. I mean all of these birds ended up in an animal sanctuary which is great for the birds but not so good for sanctuaries as it means they're less able to take in animals which are actually in need. plus he is not "saving'' these eggs, yes they were fertilised but that just means they had the potential to become a chick, not that he somehow saved a load of quails by doing this. instead he just added a bunch more quails to the world which I dont really think is needed. it would be different if he had intended to keep these birds but obviously thats not what happened. I just dont think adding more animals to the world and dumping them on a sanctuary is a very responsible thing to do for an experiment for a youtube video. and it encourages his audience to do the same, which I sincerely hope nobody does unless they actually know what they're doing and intend to keep the birds at the end of it. Basically if you didnt already want quails, dont do this.  I dont think there were bad intentions making this video and I can tell he did care about the animals as he did actually give them proper care and made sure they had somewhere to go when he no longer could take care of them. but I just think the premise of this as an experiment is rather irresponsible.
In the famous words of Jeff Goldblum life finds a way And in the famous words of John Hammond life will find a way
0:16 never waste your eggs they are so delicious.
I never saw a baby chick before and I love baby chicks
Wow wow wow, that's fantastic and amazing, thank you for doing this experiment and saving the lives of so many chicks. I do eat eggs but only because I thought they weren't viable. I'm discusted how they "sort" through the chicks and just chuck them in the next tray as if sorting frozen fruit. These chicks are ALIVE.
😱😭🫡🐣
I just thought of some thing. If two children are born within the same day they are called twins. So my question is what are the chicks called that are born in the same day. Chins?
Awwn this so fascinating...Keep going I love your content...I love how all your emotions seemed so sincere...at least I'm not the only one who tries these things
i love your videos
I’m surprised you hatch those eggs.

That was so cute😂
Woowo😧😨🐣🐣🐣🐣
They are so cute!!!
How are they doing now
I loved the video and the babies were so adorable 🥰
I know my eggs are not fertile as I only have girls and no rooster ,don’t want chicks as half of the ones hatched are going to grow up as roosters and there is really only one outcome for those .
If they are grocery store eggs  then they are not fertilized and refrigerated. They should not hatch.
7:00 Music got me crying😢
I really hope that you told that lady what you did❤
cool! maybe i should do this
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤗👏🏾🤗👏🏾🤗👏🏾🤧
Do you like Boys or girls
The only way that can work is if they sell u fertilized eggs....
You’re the best YouTuber you’re the first YouTuber you’re the best. You’re the first YouTuber to catch a quilt from a grocery store.

😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Those chicks are so cute😍
That made my day so much better than yesterday. Thanks 👍🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am very happy of you because even from Sri Lankan I know you can do anything because when I try to help a bird my dog  ate last poor Bird so don't give up.  In life  pin this comment about me when you're done
I want one ☹️
Unbelievable that is so awesome but you still cannot give up on that one egg
GOG
So what does this say about the so call "expert" and that Sainsbury’s supermarket?
Most eggs in the US aren’t fertilized
f   Fuck
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥳🤩😎🥰
"I'll never be able to look at eggs the same way" 🥹, dude, those eggs came from quails, quails that were hatched from EGGs tOo😶, caviar is eggs of an endangered species and you eat that with delicacy,so.. 😒
The way he was so excited made me so happy:)
new  pet
Your soo good on this
i'm never eating eggs and bacon AGAIN
The parts of an egg that we eat are not the baby birds themselves, contrary to what many tend to believe. The yolks and the whites serve as food for a growing embryo, and also food for us when we cook it before an embryo has even grown, only if it had been fertilized.
Then you could eat chicken now
Life finds a way!
😊😂❤❤
Amazing!!!!
I was so happy those are so preacouse
Life will find a way: Jurassic Park: Michael Cricton.
When I was 8 years old my favorite type of eggs with quail eggs but now that you made this video I regret this also online now, so I don’t really like Quail eggs and plus that was like a long time ago
Name it qilly!
Now I wanna do it     No actually!!
Update?
If you spent £2 more to just get guaranteed fertile eggs and the same amount
1000next
i had idea b4 this army idea
This might sound totaly out there but am gonna try and an artificialy inseminate my own SPERM into every egg from now on get them incubated an give birth to a breed of killer hunter quail half breeds an take over the world.. Wheres the XXX MAGS. I HAVE SOME SUPER QUAIL HUMANS FOR MILITARY
i need to try this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awww❤
When did YouTube start call me commenting like common I’m getting confused
You can also make a baby chick out of a egg
I know that this would be evil but would there be meat in the egg if you fried it with a quail inside of it
Why did I think this guy was Jake Paul when he appeared on my recommendations
imagine being the first wasted eggs lol
يقلد أحمد أبو الرب
Im watching this while eating boiled eggs 💀
What happened to the chicks now?
Poultry farmer here.... Yes. You can .. **if they are fertile** your best bet is pasture raised organic eggs.  Most of those are fertile. There is no rule that says you cant have roos.  Once thet are refrigerated, it stops the incubation process but it does *not* kill the egg.
9:24 god has made another specimen
1:59 YEET
Is the british anti embryo law as a result of fear of ingesting rooster semen?
funny content❤
🎉❤😊
nice
Guys this is fake 😂
😮😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉❤
Your problem is that you keep touching them and taking  the lid out
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I remember when i was younger i took an egg from my fridge and got a bunch of fluffy blankets and etc it had been 1 week in the blankets a stuff and my mom found out she said oh wow it’s been 2 weeks and it’s probably not going to hatch so we took the egg and broke it open and omg  I SAW A LITTLE CHICKEN DEVELOPMENT GOING ON my mom was shocked so yeah wow
13:13 was like a army raid 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro said vitemens
We need updates
I DID THIS FOUR TIMES one duck didn’t live tho :(
Bb garage Telford
This is a good idea in theory, but a lot of it isn’t true.  The only way you’d hatch a quail egg is if it was never refrigerated, and was incredibly fresh, and the only way you’d get a fertile egg is if a male got into a pen with female quail, which while more likely than it happening in chickens, is still quite rare.
Why do I really wanna step on one?😢…
I’m so happy for you
r you okay
Salam satu hobi
New here! ❤Seeing your excitement of that first hatch was sooo adorable! 😊 love it
I’m so happy for you, it brings me almost to tears. Seeing baby birds reminds me of a bird I took care of after it fell out of its nest and was abandoned, poor thing passed away 2 weeks later. I named it Treble (it wasn’t even old enough for me to tell the gender, it was a newborn) I’m so happy that you took the time and money just to hatch some eggs. This makes me unbelievably proud of some parts of humanity, please continue making more videos like this (or just in general). They’re so authentic it just gives me a breath of fresh air watching videos like these!!
Cantake roteded army 😂😂😂
8snt 1 good enough but relly is that elegal or😂

Hey, yeah yeah yay
❤ Baby chicken so cute❤
Send the quails to me right now I won’t fight them. I’ll hug them.
I love how inspiring this video and I always wanted chickens and, I went to a farm and named a chick Simone and it meant the world for me to keep this chicken and I have a lizard that I let out every day and I have so much love for my lizard and I see chickens in my neighborhood sometimes and I take pics of them and it means the world to me to see these amazing creatures and think to myself those things are so cute and, I love creatures but chickens are more to me than a creature they are a world to me. I really love the species of this animal and I love chickens.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊

Please give us an update on them!
❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
You need to be their mother by using your hands like wings they will hide under them like their mama wings ,by hatching so many ,you no better than the giant hatcheries ,naturally chicks will be their mother comforts the chick while in the egg ,mass hatchings means the chicks are automatically distressed ,which is why they peep peeep they are frightened and wanting mother,chicks reared by the the mother don’t peep peep constantly,one hatched they snuggle under her and she teaches them . As someone who keeps poultry as a back garden flock ,I am dismayed at at your cavalier attitude and your ignorance about how terrified mass hatched chicks are ,their  little peep peeps are them desperately calling for a mother  Hatching that many is causing great distress to the chicks . You did this without any understanding,i’m even suspicious that you actually purchased fertile eggs to to hatch en mass.. This is not a thing to do for views .
hi

😮Lauryn Saunders 7:55
You are a father now 🎉🎉
Why is this guy making this so dramatic? Blud chill it’s just an EGG, it doesn’t matter if it was fertile or not. U making it it seem like super markets are killing quails by selling fertile eggs. The eggs aren’t alive just because they are fertile, Bro here acting like “I saved a quails life!!!” When the quail wouldn’t even exist if it weren’t for him. I mean it’s totally fine as a fun experiment that ur doing by incubating supermarket eggs but it doesn’t have to be this dramatic. It’s just an EGG🥚.
infinite food glitch the quails will grow bigger have some eggs
Congrats for being a father of 193 birds😂
We love you jay 😊 love your viteos
I’m vegan. So’s “ A Chick Named Albert”..   eggs really aren’t that good for you…love is!

i thought super market eggs are unfertilized
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww so cute ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I remember how excited I felt when I hatched my first batch of chicken eggs. And I still get excited with every batch I hatch. I have been raising and intubating my own eggs for almost 5 yrs now. I haven't bought eggs ever since. If my eggs aren't fertile, then we eat them and sell them. If they r fertile, we incubated and either keep them, sell them, or sometimes give them away. But remember, if u want fertilized eggs, then u need a hen and a rooster. If you just want eggs to eat, you only need a hen. Also, I forgot to say I have different breeds of chickens and even ducks. And yes, you can eat duck eggs. Duck eggs are best for baking. They make your cakes, bread, cookies. Whatever ur baking duck eggs make them so much fluffier. And they make great omletes.
the vegan teacher is gonna love this video

Most peopl eeat bacon with eggs, so why so dramatic? Baby pigs are also sweet looking.
Congrats on being a father, no wait, females tend to the eggs until hatching, so; Congrats on being a Quail mommy!
Wait, farm eggs shouldn’t be fertilized. Incubator or not they shouldn’t hatch. Chickens at least
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
😠😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was so happy that I watched it again and I cried twice happy tears

Can we get chickens> What about the alotment
Name them bruce and hanna❤😊
In fact, no one needs to eat eggs as long as they have access to a variety of other foods! Plant foods provide ample protein but more importantly, phytonutrients and fiber, which eggs lack.  Also an important thing to note is that most hatcheries systematically kill male chicks because they obviously don’t lay eggs, and they only need a small number for breeding.
Jay is a good guy
Yug is a good guy
I want one
aww they are s8 cute

If you're making brownies or a cake, you can use bananas as an egg replacement. That is, if you wanna stop eating eggs. I'm not forcing. You do you, pal.
I cried when the first quail hatched you are right after watching this video I cannot eat eggs the same way

You  australian mate?
also i THINK you can inject whatever type of chicken sperm into the eggs to make it fertile. i am most likely extremely wrong, but i saw someone do it online, so im just assuming they MIGHT be right.
You put so much trust
What's going to happen with the chicks now then?

They don't sell unfertilized eggs because they don't want people to raise chickens, they sell unfertilized eggs because otherwise you'd end up getting surprise balut sometimes. Nobody wants to crack an egg into the pan and have a half-developed chick come out.
This video made me emotional - in a good way. One of the best videos he's done! Absolutely love you Jay. One of my favourite Youtubers 🐥❤

In the beginning, there was Cheese. Not just any cheese, but the primordial Cheese from which all existence sprang forth. It was creamy and divine, filling the void with its richness and potential. From this Cheese, the universe unfolded, galaxies swirling like curds in the cosmic soup. In this Cheese-centric belief system, everything in existence owes its origin to Cheese. Stars, planets, and all life forms emerged from the fermenting depths of the Cheese. The diversity of cheeses reflects the diversity of creation itself — sharp cheddars, delicate bries, and pungent blues each representing different aspects of existence and the divine. As life developed, Cheese played a central role in shaping civilizations. Ancient cultures revered Cheese as a gift from the divine, offering it in sacred rituals and celebrations. The cycle of life was believed to be intertwined with the cycle of Cheese: birth, maturation, consumption, and ultimately, decomposition back into the essence of Cheese. Cheese became a symbol of abundance, nourishment, and interconnectedness. It brought communities together in feasts and celebrations, strengthening bonds and honoring the divine essence within all beings. Stories and myths were woven around the mysteries of Cheese, explaining the mysteries of creation and the cosmos. As time passed, Cheese continued to influence human cultures and philosophies. Its flavors and textures inspired art, literature, and even technology. The pursuit of perfecting Cheese-making became a noble endeavor, seeking to unlock the secrets of creation and preservation. In the cosmology of Cheese, the end of all things is also tied to Cheese. Just as life begins with Cheese, so too does it end in Cheese. When the universe reaches its ultimate maturity, it is said to return to the Great Cheese, where all things merge and dissolve into the eternal fondue of existence. Adherents of this Cheese-centric religion find spiritual fulfillment in honoring Cheese through gratitude, mindfulness, and responsible stewardship of natural resources. They celebrate life’s milestones with Cheese, recognizing its role as a conduit of the divine essence within and without. In essence, the religion of Cheese teaches that the universe is a profound and interconnected tapestry, woven from the threads of curd and whey. It invites believers to contemplate the mysteries of existence while savoring the divine essence that binds all things — the Cheese that is the beginning and the end of everything. The 🧀 will ALWAYS first, no matter the consumable, cheese will rise above it, even if you consumable taste better, cheese will still be number one, if you really don't like cheese, or think it is the best consumable in the ENTIRE world, I don't know if I'm speaking to a real human being, homo sapien, evolved fish, whatever we are, cause cheese was the first, you think the big bang happened? Wrong, the big cheese happened, the creation of cheese, then came the big bang. You look up into the sky, what do you see? Space? Wrong. Cheese. Ranking a carrot to the cheese is.. is... I don't even know... it is formidable, it is.. unforgiving, like one of the seven deadly sins but 1000x times worse. I can't think of even one thing better than cheese, not even myself. The cheese is just too good. When I first glanced at the cheese I just... I cried.. Maybe I was sent? Sent by the cheese gods? To preach of cheese? Maybe I'm just a normal human being, possibly. I can't even think of anything besides cheese sometimes, like it's... eating my alive. Consuming me more than I consume it. No.. I'm just speaking nonsense now.. I will prove my worth to cheese. So I hope you learned a lesson, mortal. Cheese is the one in control, not you. Not a small, puny, litte mortal. Cheese will rise to war with all other consumables, and I'll stand with it. Because cheese made me, made all of us.. Yet you don't believe it? You'll see eventually, you'll open your eyes to freedom and a world of cheese, that is if you do open your eyes. I fear for you.
You should buy an uninhabited island and name it quail island and just put a crap ton of quails on it 😊

welp sainsbury is gonna lose their contract
The hatch is 1.000%
''''Dad how was i born?'' ''''Supermarket''
I call the cap, supermarket eggs are washed therefore removing the sheild and making this video faked
I was eating eggs while watching this-
its not a 10% chance to hatch its about 30% or more if you  are on a farm and have chickens there. but super market is 15% so yeah. i live on a farm with 127 chickens and it fun ig but hatching is the best part
Hello Jay I’m Etain and I love your videos and you made me vegan

Can I get one
And the other one Gabriel
This video was so uneducated, and I'm claiming bull on that many fertilised eggs, law of averages suggest no chance, even with the eggs suppliers accidental inclusion.
That is so cool Jay, I have often wondered if it was possible to hatch eggs from the grocery store…
Eat the egg granny from the quills
The hoo hoo hooooo!
Life uh, life finds a way.
New hobby idea?
I like dance scribed❤
Hi Jay,  This was just lovely and I do admire how you put it all together.  It was quite moving and exciting and a great deal of fun.  I've subscribed to help the "cause" All the Best from Mexico, Jim
Congrats on becoming a mother
Me and my class Try To hatch quails, but none of them hatched😢
I got a question. Do you sell the chickens after this or do you keep them?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What r u gonna do with all the quails now?
i was hoping one of the chicks would say " helloooo daddy! helllooooo daddy"
I love it so much that I won't be able to sleep.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hey, it’s fine. I like your videos that’s why I liked and describe because this is the cutest thing ever ever ever ever. Thank you for this thing and you’re actually hacking one that is so sick. 7:28
This felt so good to watch and inspired me to raise some little birds so I’m going to buy one of them incubator things.
Like this Message If you should hatch 500 more If this gets to 100K likes Then he should do it
Please make sure that you do proper research and make sure that these little guys get safe and healthy homes!
This is so cool I want to try to do this but I don’t think I can do it because my store puts the eggs in the freezer
Ciake   😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😊❤
I think I can do it because I have a local chicken farm near my house 😊😊❤
What the flock have you done?? Seriously, what a WILD adventure in quail raising, long may they fly! 🙌
I didn’t watch the vid but this title alone is stupid because it is quite literally impossible to hatch these supermarket eggs because they are not fertilized. Eggs in stores come from hens (female chickens) and for them to hatch they must be fertilized by a rooster (male chicken) but, the hens that produce these eggs that go to stores do not ever meet roosters so it is impossible to fertilize the eggs and therefore impossible to hatch them. Again I didn’t watch the video I only saw the title but if the eggs actually did end up hatching I’m sure sometime they were swapped out with fertilized eggs when he wasn’t filming. (Edit) those are not quail eggs because actual quail eggs are much much smaller
Dude this is my first time watching you and I have a feeling I'm going to subscribe to you because you just seems so interesting and it's like so cool you're trying to hatch an egg
o my god
Get this man to 10mil bros my fav ytber from now on.

I’m 😢😢😢 right now cause I used to have chickens that I gave away and I really really miss them
🎉 I tried to hatch some chiken eggs
I can’t find a single comment asking what happened to them… maybe it’s in there but buried …. Are you keeping them? Eating them? Selling them? Are they ok? Are you just going to have almost 200 quails casually living in your house? 😭 why is there no follow up?!? I will likely never come back to this comment so I will likely never know.
In school are science teacher Did the light thing cause are principal had egg and he said  to are science teacher he want to see if there are any live in the egg
I never want to eat eggs ever again
I remember you and Homie doing funny, crazy stupid things on YouTube and now look at you! I love the growth❤️ and hope you still have your goofy side.
Aw, he’s so wholesome now😭❤️
Thats why I am a vegan!
They're so cute
Aww
I love this story
😂❤
Once you get a army more of quails “WE ATTACK AT THE CRACK OF DAWN”
I did this experience in first grade
Mother instincts coming in for this jay .... He's been in labour most of this video... Bless him....... I'm still eating meat tho .
You need to do this more And save more eggs and create an whole entire army And I mean like a whole entire USA army And just do the same thing you did in this video But with the same eggs
Oh, that’s crazy because while I was watching this video, I was making scrambled eggs and cheese and bacon and sausages 😂😂😂
My favourite video
The leader of the army of quails the one who hatched them
this stuff is amazing forget mrbeast hellow Jay swingler
Watch this video about 15 times bald head
It’s so good and I got chickens at my dad‘s house and you might have a yellow one or a black one and I’m really hoping one hatches. I haven’t gone for the full video today I’m gonna go through right now
Do you know right thing?
Wait he can work at th army😂😂😂

This is actually why I don't eat eggs or meat anymore!!!!!!
I wonder if this is doable in America. Our eggs are refrigerated in the store and I feel like any fertilized eggs would have died before we can even buy them.
We use to have ten Quail but now we have two and they're bigger than the ones you have
Their video shows how life is beautiful and meaningful

These eggs could have been slurped up but you saved them. Beautiful
❤❤❤❤❤❤so cute 😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
1. It's extremely common for quail eggs to be fertilized as there are less restrictions (it's a specialty food item, and not really "eaten for breakfast" as they're quite small) 2. Fertilized eggs does not mean there is a bird, it just means it's fertilized. I dunno why this dude puts such emphasis on it like it's a serious problem. Farm fresh eggs from markets are also often fertilized.  3. Supermarket chicken eggs (the ones you DO eat for breakfast) are never fertilized compared to quail eggs.  4. Future reference, don't leave older chicks with younger chicks because they will peck/bully the smaller ones and even kill them. Quail are monstrous to other quail.  5. You keep conflating chicken statistics with quail. I've no doubt many chicken chicks die every year, but you hatched quails buddy.  6. Quail eggs have more vitamins and minerals proportionately than chicken eggs (and are very good pickled :) ) not a correction, just an interesting fact.  7. If you DO do this yourself - be sure to get a 30% protein feed, as quail need much higher protein than chickens do in order to keep themselves going. DO NOT feed them chicken crumb like this nob did.
SOOOOOOOOOO CUTE
Every quail farm know there're some Male quails that can be look like hens and some hens can look like Males. It can't be 100% check by colours or strips on the chest, only blood check for 100% which's cost a lot for 1 bird. It's common that there will be some male mix in the cage and because the battery cage are banned in UK. So they keep them all in the large cage. And 1 Male can mat with 10 hens, so it's not about the corruption. It's about control & cost issue. You probably made some farmers lost their business. Congrats!
Yeah, this is to have a baby duck, but it wasn’t my house so I got it
haha jay his vid make me happy and congrats and your army of CUTE BABY OF QUAILS THEY ARE SO CUTEEEEEEEE  ily jay and congrat
I have a pet Chicken who i raised on my own, I had him when he was just a clump of feather!! Now he grew, very sassy and peck on me when i dont fill up his water all the way up 💀💀 The only hard thing about raising chicken is that they poop ALOT LOLLL
you made a mistake when you put the eggs in the incubator. The eggs should be placed with the point downwards. Such that the air chamber in the egg points upwards.
but i dont have quail/fertilized eggs in my supermarket
The first egg that you hatched I have a name for it…….     Saint bre
Thank you ❤
Wait that means every egg I eat has a baby?! 😱 nuuuuu

Congrats! Your now a father
I found a baby chick, his name was chico teriyaki... When i found him he was alone in the forest cuz I was out camping with my parents it was raining and cold when i found him... He was very cute and treated me as his mother/father I'm a guy btw... He died 2 days later cuz I had to leave for Youth Camp and left for 3 days... And then when I came back he died... Probably he was cold cuz no one can "incubate?" (Is it the right term?) him so he died
Incubate em to them raise and BBQ 😂
This is my first video and honestly it was super entertaining loved the vid keep it up man
😮 I'm literally crying because it's so cute I just can't describe it I'm just trying like I can't believe it's possible 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

I can't wait to see him eat the birds
you are the best
@achickencalledalbert must be really proud!!!
I love birds
❤❤❤❤
Few tips for curious minds and potential quail owners: 1) something might go wrong during hatching, so be morally ready for it. 2) chicks mortality rate is high and quails are not the strongest bird in the world, be ready for that as well. 🫡 3) quails don’t really like open spaces much. They associate it with being out in the open for potential flying predators. But it doesn’t mean all chicks are like that. Some will do just fine hanging out with their owners.
lol
I hatched one egg from albert heyn; supermarket in holland, the netherlands. It worked. His name is little albert haha
The quail flood 13:50

Enjoying your videos very much!!!!
❤❤❤🎉🎉😊😊
13:54 chickens: GO GO GO
In New York there was a thing where the government wanted us to hatch quails and release them for money. They were disappearing and I think they did disappear. They used to stop by all the time but they don’t anymore.
That was so wholesome.
Im shocked how the eggs hatched since zoe said that it was impossible ❤
u made me cry that is soooooooo cute I am actually crying rn
Avengers assemble

As the video went on I started to get so excited about them hatching ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊
This is by far the best video i watched today and it´s the first video I watched from your channel. I instantly subscribed!
I love animals 😂😥
The way he got so excited about these baby birds! Pure joy! 😁
welcome to the world little guy, you’re from Sainsbury’s made me laugh so hard it hurt.
I wanna say that being born and raised not by a chicken will make them not have the parenting feeling because they never experienced that. (Just to let you know)
awwwwwwwww
YouTube how did you do that!?
I have a quail:)
WHO PROMISE HERE BE VEGETERIAN!!!!!
Damn! That is incredible!! I am amazed that it worked, I don't know what to even say!!!
But if you send them to me I'm not hurting them.I am a bird lover.I could never hurt a bird.I tried to save one that was dead by my bus stop , but sadly , we couldn't save him or her
Thank you for saving them 🥹
I almost cried
that is amazing
❤❤❤❤❤
Man made me cry I loved this video
9:34 I need to go get my mom for some thing
8:40 name him megatron
6:40 I love when adult are this happy!!
so cool
Thank you for saving the baby chicks
quial army🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤
I’ve always wanted to hatch a quail egg now I got to see someone do it 🥺🥹
Makes, me a little bit glad that I am allergic to eggs!
Cool stuff
pretty cool. just means the farm the eggs came from had a rooster. Regular factory farm chicken eggs off of the shelf will not do this because there is no rooster to fertilize the eggs. Small batch quail egg farms probably just take the chance that you are going to refrigerate them/eat them before this happens. Fertilized eggs can sit on a shelf for a month and then if you incubate them they will start the process of making a baby chicken. neat stuff.
Congrats😮
they dont want u hatching store bought eggs because they see self sustainability as a threat to corporate greed.
I’m probably not gonna eat extra I will end up eating them again till one of my favorite foods there delicious and cute but I’ll try not to waste my eggs when they get cold
Omg I subbed because of this I love seeing people hatch eggs
Name the first qauil hidden gem

Hello, I am back. I have another question. Can you do Chicky?
Keep on doin stuff like this I'd love to see more of it just an idea  you could take a crab from the supermarket  and raise that just a super thanks to you I don't have money to give you but if I could I would I love this content please we want more
When I was on my trip in africa to see my family My uncle got me a pet chicken named tenders. She and I bonded and if I walked away she would run to me. I had her for a week until I went to the National park with my mom, sister, and brother. We were gone for about 4 hours. When we came back I opened tenders box to check on her and play with her. But I saw her laying down in a weird way and her legs were stretched out. She was dead. I was crying so much and when I showed my uncle downstairs and the others, my uncle explained it was from the heat. My uncle got me two chickens the same day and I named them June and July. But 2 days later July died. Turns out my younger cousin  killed Tenders and July. I was crying when I found out the truth, only June was left. I had to leave her with my uncle for her own safety. The kid was beat up for doing such a terrible thing.            Now Tenders and July may rest in peace and go to paradise. Thank you for reading this and knowing how 2 loved and cherished chickens had their lives taken.

So the supplier did lose their contract?🖕
Omg 😱 what a surprise 🎉
WOW!!!🥲🥹🤯
Suppliers contract is gone aye 😂😂
There so CUTE!!
QUAIL ARMY!!!
I love this. You are so relatable. Thanks for the video!
Congratulations I thought one but 12 congratulations cool, father
Mate how the fek do you guys manage to waste eggs?? I always buy one or two 15 packs of eggs and I eat about 6-7 in one meal regardless if they're fried or boiled. They don't even have time to stay in the fridge long enough let alone go out of date. Even if it's breakfast time and they're just scrambled and I have them with something else I still eat about 5. Also for every million eggs humans eat there's about billion eggs being eaten in the wild by all the other creatures and insects on the planet. And that's an understatement.
Amazing 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Name a chic niamh
what about common chicken eggs????
i should do this
13:48 Quails!! Assemble!!
Hey jày, id like a link to the baby monitor , the smart incubator, and the big incubator products..
Jay u make da best vids i bought some fertile eggs and imma name one of them after you

I know no one could hatch the eggs from my hen as I don’t have a rooster ,my neighbours would be super pissed if had one ,,so no rooster activity for my girls.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
How are the chicks now
Bro almost got crazy🥹

Since after you, I’ve started hatching eggs at a supermarket and it worked. Thank you so much for me to try to hatch an egg.
@veganteacher

🐤🐤🐤🐤
Name him or her chip
I feel bad for eating eggs now 😭
Wgocktz
Can you do it again🎉
This is the cutest and most wholesome thing ive ever seen!Good job!
So here's the question. Did Sansbury find out about this success with the quail eggs?   Also great job taking care of them!
I LOVE THEM
That's amazing, but, what will you do with all of these chicks?
Suvud❤❤
Chicken eggs in supermarkets are all infertle.  Easy to kick any roosters out.    Quail - much harder to kick the boys out.  Harder to distinguish the genders, at least as a human.    I have raised both chickens and quail.  And, yes, since i am doing this home grown, i have roosters with my chicken hens.  The eggs taste the same, and don't grow into new chicks unless you provide some heat incubation.    I am glad to see he got his baby quail!!
I love that you just created hundreds of quails instead of eating them for breakfast
People who are gonna do this                            👇
I think I found the perfect channel to watch. 🎈
A Chick Called Albert would be Proud of You.
At least the mother quail knows their babies aren't eaten for breakfast
Hi
Good 👍
My Grandma gives me x from her father.Far foundation chickens , but she make sure that the eggs that have struck in them to get an attentional checks on the egg egg
to see how committed you are to this experiment really tells us something about your channel. it shows that you are a determined, hardworking, intelligent lad and we all love to watch your videos! still can't believe that you turned something that may have just been wasted into a valuable life!! even when everyone said it would be nearly impossible, you still managed to make it happen!! absolutely incredible, man. keep up the amazing work🙏
Hi loved seeing the baby's thank you
You are such a good guy you’re the best keep buying eggs and hatching please 🥺
101 SUPERMARKET EGGS
Bro I will be honest i was smiling all the time after the quails hatched 😂❤
did you keep one?
banger
Vegan rant💀
Your content is like the best thing ever You are amazing❤🐣
nah, this is minions all over again
Geez, man -- quail are sooo easy to keep.  Grow super fast,  can be kept in a small pet cage, eat ground up grains or cat food or game bird feed.  In about 6 weeks, you would have been getting your own eggs from those lil gals!  After your fresh laid eggs, you can incubate those --- and in 18 days, you'll have grand-quail hatching out!  Do it, man !
After you have to leave them in the incubator for a week
No you didnt. Supermarket eggs are not fertilized and reached too cold of a temperature
You did it🎉🎉🎉🎉😊 hope you raise them to be an amazing army
Fookin hell brov, amazing....im super impressed...gotta take my hat,off to you sir..  get u some of that. Massive respect 🙏 🫡
Not to be a hater but people have done this before like 2 years ago
This is crazy! That is crazy I am so proud of the two of those eggs that hatched!
Biology is for sure the most exciting science. Great job!
This guy gets the chicks!
How can you even take care of all of them
❤❤❤😂🎉
i want fo do this now lol
The chicks are so cute❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I want one
A
I do know that eggs will hatch from the store
They are SO cute omfg
VERY NICE
8:32 almost started crying, how beautiful. You created a life that will be able to be happy and free. Thank you Jay. :')
Fvck supermarkets and corrupt people who put eggs in their that can actually produce life and shouldn't have been food.
I was hoping you were giving away the quails
Well atleast he uncovered her true self ,those 50$ were well spent
Can we do it with other kinds of birds?
good👍
Everyone, Please dont say Gods name in vain. it is blasphemy, disrespect to God. Jesus Christ loves you, God Bless🙏🏼✝️ Amen.
12:09 BETTTT
You are making and saving life
Did he get fertile eggs and pretend they are from the grocery store?
Love❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🪺🐣
I own one and it just brings me joy
the chicks are prob button or california quails, You can tell if they are a button quail by their small size and dark stripes, But theres a high percentage that they are california quails. due to the stripes being more noticable and less faint then a button quail's [possibly wrong]
just subscribed
In sweden they often have a rooster together with hens when they are ECO eggs. doesn't seem to be the same in other countries😅.
What happened to the babies in the end? Did you keep them?
Did he just destroy a farm's reputation???
Jay how about 10 more 😂😂
You have saved many lives
Which Sainsburys do I go and vomit on?
Were all the quail army eggs, store bought ones that weren't meant to be fertilized, too?
Then there's Balut....
I've had a beak and feathers before, in a store bought egg.
Haven't the eggs temperature dropped too low? Like if a parent bird leaves the eggs too long, don't they become unviable? Even if it was fertilized.
It’s pretty low to hatch quail eggs from the supermarket it’s pretty low…but never zero!
But hooooooow
I can't eat eggs anymore!
I have no idea if this is real or not. To be honest I do think it is but if it's not, I would not be surprised
It's so cool seeing this side of you. I always knew you and Romell as menaces who risk their lives doing crazy stunts but you've really matured over the years without losing what made you you. I respect that.
Awesome!
The next us army🎉
this is an amazing video 😂❤❤❤
Hi😊
love u, bro respect from Egypt
i sent nuke to storr
He actually did it❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 he hatched the egg almost like a army of eggs yes yes 😄😄😄😄
This is an incredible result to a science question.
But what did you do with all the quail? Are you just a quail farmer now?
You could have just thrown the eggs on the floor and a quail would have a chance spawn
Jay I'm so proud of you mate good on ya but how and were u gonna ceep them you really are great. From Kevin legate from London
Amazing
this is epic
Hi🎉
We need a update on how they are doing!
10:27
I love seeing quails on videos please do an update if any other ones start hatching
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅
also, i forgot to say that it,s crazy that you could do this expieriment a have sucsess on it because it,s less than 10 percent to hatch store eggs again congrats
congrats on hatching a army of quails🎊🥰🐦also i am going todo the same expirement
Nah I am not losing for quails 💀
damn
I don't want to  eat them they are to cute😊😊
My only question is What are you going to do with all these birds lol
The eggs you buy in the supermarket are actually reasonably likely to be fertilized. They claim it's near zero percent but a youtuber bought 350 eggs to see if any would hatch and 193 did hatch.
Go vegan
Good job, arent you meant to keep them in the incubator for 24hrs after they hatch so they eat whatever is left in the egg?
Wow 0 percent
Super cool dude
You need to put little top hats on them
So wholesome ❤❤❤❤❤
This is thr cutest thing I have seen today 😂❤❤

Wow. That's actually so amazing.
Im A fan i subscribed
You can hear the pure excitement and adrenaline running through him lol
I'm gonna try this
I was like what!?
Definitely going to be the strongest army out there 💪🏻
Egg
I don't know if you guys nude but if you buy a night from the supermarket you try to hatchet and you have to have extra melody a lot of scare and if it's just your chance there's no boy you also need to try to give it the hotness and more extra hot but if it has the melon the girl and the female you can just put it in The Sun and you can be sure Take it naturally but always be careful and yes wash your hands after taking care of it and after a hat because they also have the third of you know the turtles have an infectionalso chicken sauce so be careful wash your hands and shower
I have hands and let's just keep them and i want them to hatch an egg but they don't do that so i take the eggs and i try to hatching too Last time and they hatched but there was no mouth no boy and so that's the weird thing for me cause yeah and I'm gonna try to hatch this One let's Hope attaches even though there's no boy
Refrigeration does not necessarily 'kill' the egg. If they are refrigerated at an early growth stage, and then gradually brought back to room temperature before being incubated, they are still likely to be viable. If they are 'kept' refrigerated (more than a week or so), it will kill the egg.
Please, I really wanna quail.I live in Canada on armor road.I'm a really big fan

Congrats bro  ❤
the ending tho ;)
jay youve gave me an inspiration to do that when im old enough  , i promise i will and i will post it on youtube 😀
Did video is the best🥳👍🫶❤️🎉
I officially fear you now, they are weak now. But when they grow up......           Humanity is not safe....
ha   ha    ha.    haaaa haaa
HHHHHHHAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I believe the lady was talking about chicken eggs, Chicken Hens will freely lay out of the presence of male birds. As far as I know Quail are kept in large flocks of mixed sexes because the females are stimulated to lay by the presence of male birds and so the majority of Quail eggs sold in markets are going to be fertile. Side note for anyone keeping quail, they are extremely nervous birds and easily startled. There first instinct when startled is usually to fly upward to escape whatever has frightened them. You have to either house them in a pen less than 10 inches (25.4 cm)  high or higher than about 4.5 feet (137 cm), because anything in between those heights lets the birds try to fly up and they often hurts themselves hitting the roof of the pen and can even break their own necks. Glad the quail are doing well, and glad you did this lovely experiment. Good job, Happily Subbed. <3
My grandma said it’s in possible to hatch a egg from the supermarket, but we proved her wrong
Awwwwww❤😢
Bro this is such an amazing video keep up the good work
😊😊😊
Why buy from Sainsbury’s  buy from Asda it’s cheaper
Sorry I can not subscribe
I also heard in the USA, or who knows where THAT MC DONALDs eggs can make you infertile in your semen.
If i buy supermarket eggs with my own money, i have the right to hatch the bastards
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA CUTE😂
What are the quail doing now
i can’t believe it hatched! you kept putting it out and that messes the hatching up!
I like it I like your this video
Plot twist, the shells get sent to a farm and they lay eggs and he does this again and he gets the quail eggs from the previously mentioned farm
Man, this video is way better than I expected
Go swingler! :) You are awesome!
Imagine if doing this was an original idea, or if you had at least given credit to channels like "A Chick Called Albert". #JustSaying
This is so fun I want to try this at home you are really good keep up the work❤
Yes I will let quails kill me because they are too cute for me . And yes I HAVE A QUAIL AS MY PROFILE AND THIS IS A REAL QUAIL I HAVE . I  HAVE A QUAIL AS MY PET OK
I never thought you can do that😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊😊😊
Zoey said " 0% chance for a quail to hatch" she doubted jay but, I never did
That’s so cool
If I could I would do the same but not give them away I would be heartbroken 💔
Can I have one
Su uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu b
Mmmm mmm mmm aaaaaa so very cute (*’(OO)’*)
Jay your making a army or super market Eggs you should bring them to the supermarket and make the manager made 😂
He’s the super market egg person 😂
Yeah 😂
Is no one going to talk about the questionable male shape of the egg and she’ll at the start 👀
❤❤❤can’t believe this is happening
anata wa, mon shun deru

So cute❤
this is truly beautiful
I think it will just make us die to the cuteness
I love this this is so sad what is that in a good way thank you for making this video if you even get banned from YouTube still thanking you
There's no way your quails will cross the pacific ocean  to attack my house
This is the best video I’ve seen this YEAR!😂
You should not let go those first two😭🌸
I have hatched many chicks from chickens to ducks, turkeys, and pheasants and hopefully geese soon, almost all the time only a few especially pheasants will hatch. One time we put in 70 eggs and 2 hatched.
Wow  my sister wants  a chick lmao name in it chuckles
One person, yes one person before, HATCHED a chicken w a quail egg and he got a chick! WOW (not hoax) the separated part is the air (hope) for the chicken
this makes me want to do this with my son so we can let them freeroam after in our property
WW2 vibes 11:12
JUICEY FROM SOCKSFOR1 AND 2 AND 3
My first time watching this guy and his vid is pretty good. editing is good
it is so sad that millions of Chicks can't actually live because  we eat eggs though i think with chickens it is ok because  we normally eat them anyway its the quails that are sad  to learn about.
Buy more 😊
Buy more
But someone already did this the channel a chick named Albert
Wwo
Wow

hi youtube
Congratulations❤❤❤
Really good
GGGAA 😅
WHO WON THE ARMY?
♥️
Congrats! This made me cry happily
I did subscire but i want the quails to win
bro can take over a country with that much chickens
Fertile eggs need to be pointy side down it’s better hatch rate
They don't want you hatching those eggs, because if you hatch those eggs, can't you just have your own chicken laying eggs for you?So you don't have to go back to the supermarket to buy more eggs😮
I’m never eating quail eggs again
Hi
Hi
Ai thumbnail >:(
These quails would’ve been eaten if it weren’t for Jay 🫡
Can I have the bed
do this with chikhens
like and subscribe
If you do the math, use the exact same equipment as the other guy used, you have a 55% chance of hatching an egg. One in Less than 2.
de shop is ivel
A dude has already did this I think his YouTube channel is called a quail named Albert ?… but he didn’t do an army
SUB EVERYONE!
U want be me your sub have wait reach TO 22 MILLONS SUBS !
Forever?
wassup
This video made me cry in happiness. I hate to eat eggs now. I want to try it 😊😊😊😊
14:14 WOAH I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS 😮
My mom thought I was lying about this stuff bc I snuck a egg and put it somewhere same and warm 40 days later in the middle is the night I heard a chick but I was to sleepy to get up and then I woke up went to go check on it and it was hatched and but it was dead and I had to throw it away I was crying for a few days and then I stopped crying I was still sad abt it tho but Is ok
He vegan teacher is proud of you LOL
I live in Guatemala and I am pretty sure most of the eggs I eat are fertilized. Correct me if I am mistaken, but fertilized eggs have a prominent dot on the yoke. Eggs are super food, and you can pick up chicks at any feed store. This was  definitely a surprise to see someone hatch grocery store eggs.
193 out of 350 that's about 55% hatch quota. For purchased eggs, that's a pretty good. Here in Germany, you can assume that most quail eggs you buy are fertilized. It is, however, not recommended to blindly buy quail eggs. I'm not sure how it is in UK, but in the EU, there are no real regulations about farming quails. While there are laws in place on how to keep chickens, there aren't for quails, so they often live under horrible conditions. They're also often wrongly declared. The farms write "free range", although they're actually battery-caged, because the terms aren't regulated for quails either. I'm not saying don't buy quail eggs at all, they actually have some benefits to chicken eggs. You may need to eat more quail eggs for one chicken egg, but they're higher in cholesterol (the good one) and have more beneficial fatty acids, vitamins and iron (they're also creamier and a hard-boiled quail egg is a perfect bite-sized snack). But if you do buy them, make sure they come from a place where the quails are kept under appropriate conditions.
My mum works at Sainsbury’s and she’s the reason the whole website works so if you use the online website, realise it’s my mum sorting it out.
aaaaaaaaaaaa
day 18, this happend~ ad hahaha
Subscribed to fight the Quail Army invasion, Sir! 🫡🫡
Yeah 😂
i didmy part and subbed my guy
Vegans are probaly happy that you did not eat them
I think its horrible how they don't let you hatch eggs. great video, keep it up!
❤❤ i have heard that sometimes males are miss identified and are mixed up with the females. 🤭
Name him sainsburys😊
Wow
If the eggs i got were from the supermarket and not from my chickens i would give them up
This video made me cry tears of joy
I don't know why, but this video just made eggs taste better than before.
I was about to say what are you gonna do with them once they grow up but I just read the pinned comment
This video makes me so happy idk why but first of all this man seems so sweet second of all the quails are sooooo cute and i wish I could do this lol anyway you def have my sub
This was absolutely adorable your excitement was so childlike and so darling coming from such a big masculine man I love this video
What about chicken eggs I wonder? Has anyone ever tried to hatch them?
unbelievable jay! congrats on being a father to an army of quails 😂
now hatch10000000 quails
I cant eat eggs anymore just thinking the life that's in the egg
Jay in TGF days: smashes eggs and other foods on eachother for fun.  Jay Today: **sees broken egg** “i wonder if I could’ve saved this little guy”
The baby chicks are so cute I’m so surprised you hacked them and good job saving them from being eaten
Probably one of the most wholesome videos I have seen on Youtube in a while. Keep up the amazing content you're doing, looks like I'll be pissing Sainsbury’s s off as well 😂.If you're ever in the wales area let me know I have a few Airbnb's you'd love, just as a gesture, you're videos have helped me during some dark times. It's nice to see how you have turned from a prankster to now a man with a plan. Some may say a man with a purpose. If I could subscribe again I would.
i love how happy he was to bring life to world and no matter what people say tgf better then sideman because of this vidoe alone
I've noticed that YouTube keeps recommending me videos like these, no matter how many times i say I'm not interested. I caved and watched it. It has to be good if YouTube keeps ignoring my wishes.  While i don't regret watching it, i hope YouTube stops showing me "hatching eggs from stores"
Someone’s loosing their contract and possibly livelihood! Hooray!!!!
Đinh
I actually ate some quail eggs, theyre like small eggs and more yummi
He looks like ov
Is jay crying 😢?
Awesome video. I always wanted to try hatching those 'brand' of quail eggs! Id have been just as ecstatic as you mate once you saw the heart beat 😅😅. Good video 👍🤠

Hehahah
I have done this with chicken eggs lol. I bought quite a few and I had 12 out of 20 hatch. just to prove to friends that YES you can. I redone it more in the spring time again an had more of a hatch rate as their is more of a demand of a eggs not only to eat but to hatch.... granted you have you eating ones an ones they use to breed to use to hatch out but still a lot of them are all connected together as in the hatchery.
Chicken:hey where do I come from Jay:sainsbury's 💩
What is that noise, *BAWK BAWK BAGAWK* oh no, they're here
🥺 congratulations 👏🎉
If an egg has what it takes to build a chick, I think it's a hearty breakfast!
I am NEVER EVER EVER EVER! eating eggs EVER again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hm
Yipeeeeeeee
CHICKS ASSEMBLE!!!!!!
Good job
Damn , i wouldnt be able to eat eggs after this

Gosh*
Fudging* gosh*
Me just dying after seeing the baby’s
ITS SO EMOTIONAL 😭🥺❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤💯💯GGinjust2387's
They didn't want you to hatch them because of branding, they didn't want you to hatch them because you wouldn't be paying them for their products.
Imagine the male use the female as a egg shooter gun that be op🧔✨
Honestly, always wanted to do that, but I wasn’t sure but now that I seen you I’m sure
Bro just became vegan
This is the first video I watched from you and im Already Ganna subscribe
This is so wholesome!! I love this video
🥹🥹😭😭😭😭💗
They look like cannabis seeds. Lol
Imagine going to make an omelette , crackin an egg and a half developed bird drops on the pan… i think the mortification of that is what keeps the industry selling unfertilized eggs.  It’s only logical.
I didn't think the video would turn out the way it did at the end and it left me with a big stupid smile on my face. This is awesome!
Omg BIRD ARMY NOT THE AVENGERS IT'S THE BAVENEGRS
I know what I'm doing in summer
7;12 omg its adorable! :D ❤❤❤

Wow, quails hatch so much faster and easier than chicks do.
I love your work very much I'm 9 your the best
Very cool I never thought that would happen
That is also
Remember there are second chances❤
I did a science experiment like this in 5th grade and they had almost the exact same hatch rate as fertile eggs directly from a local farm
He army must riseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Omg I’m gunna cry
SIR PENTIOUS WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
13:25 the story of the quails Attacking

Actually, I also raised an army of chickens 4 of the 12 eggs we bought hatched turned out sadly all of them were roosters we couldn’t have a friend keep them 10:12 . :(

nickname them as the first batch as the "The Lucky Two" and the whole army: "The doom army."
You forgot the candling box thing
Dude, I’m convinced Jay’s blessed by gos with this heart.
You are now a father
I feel so happy that I am little speechless I am little speechless about how you doing this egg roll I love you you are a God the battery three I mean mean you just playing life
My God you use AI for the picture thing, but that’s fine
Do chickens
The ho HO! Got me
Bro the vegan people finna prase jay fr
I absolutely love the excitement it's so cute
Yay you can get a army
The person that told him it was impossible: 👁️👄👁️
Sooo many chicken nuggets
Who tf eats quail egs anyway? they are too small lol
You found the  holy Qaul
This is amazing that you saved a qaul or you could of eaten it I'm very eggcited i thought you where yoking this video made me come out of my shell its craking I'm having a whitey my brain is fried a brilliant eggsperiment  hahaha
Egg
the eggs need to be handled as minimally as possible.  when you sloshed the fist egg around like that you likely killed the embryo.  BE GENTLE  You also should not have removed them from the incubator until they were 100% dry.
Albert the quail was the first quail to be hatched from a supermarket and was the most famous quail ever
mad
Hatching eggs is not canon it’s fantasy
good job you just saved quails life
Wicked video!! Have you seen Max Fosh manage to get a live fish from a jar of caviar?
I love the army of qual and I knew you could do it and a burst of joy happened once I saw the baby qual  I'm not eating eggs for a month😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌
new idea for my final boss for my game on castle.
Ima try this with white eggs
i dont really get the big deal of them being "they could've been breakfast" when it's super common and a normal thing to ingest eggs fertilized or not
=bruh+meme
Wow. This is amazing! I can’t believe you really did it! Great job man😃
Congrats on the quails. This video really made me happy knowing the quails survived but also upset because some of the eggs may be alive 😢. Also new sub❤
After enjoing this video who keeps support human abortion?
That professional has no idea at all and most egg farms keep a male to keep the birds calmer
I have a army of quail also
This just makes me laugh
200M
Omg
Because that's actually a A really hard possibility A really hard possibility to happen
Content is banging recently keep it up 👍
I have a major problem with what you did.  You hatch out a lot of chicks that you never intended to keep and then dump them at an animal sanctuary.  It is the same as letting you cat or dog have babies and then dumping them on your friends.  If you never intended to keep them, what is the point of hatching them out?  They NEVER would have been slaughtered for dog food.  They were eggs intended for humans to eat.  They were POTENTIAL quail, they were the equivalent of seeds.  So, out of 350 edible eggs you wasted 157 eggs and possibly got a lot of farmers in trouble for trying to keep up with inflexible quotas to grocery stores and restaurants.   If people want to hatch out quail BUY FROM A REPUTABLE BREEDER.  That helps quail breeders stay in business and protects egg farmers from YouTubers like you.
🎉🎉🎉
They are soon CUTE
:)
its fake as you can not see beins on the first day
i love birds hatch try hatching turkey
I don’t understand why people DONT go on vegan rants lol. It’s okay to talk about diets without forcing them onto people. And the reality is, the egg industry DOES kill millions of chicks a year. And millions of hens. Yes, even in the unfertilized egg industry. Earthling Ed has great videos about the egg industry. Normalizing veganism is normalizing being against animal abuse. If this were happening to dogs everyone would be in an uproar. Chickens and other “food” animals are no different.
What r u gunna do when they all sadly die  or even when there alive
Thats so awesome! I never had thought something like that was possible………
🎉❤
11:29  *has a stroke* "AAAAÆEEUGHHHH SÜB$CRÏBÈ
Alright subbed✅, for the single father of the army of quails.. Also 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 All eyes on Rafah
This is the stupidest video on YouTube

You're the best person of of anybody's life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love you!
You’re a hero 🦸
The vegans be real happy after watching this
What country pls I want quail,  😢
Wait if u dis 300 eggs with the 12 from the store, how do we know you didn't just put a fertilized egg in with the 12? 🤔🤔🤔 Just a thought I had when you said you were hatching a lot more.
You have 1.99 million almost 2 million🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm so happy that is so awesome thank you for my thank you for putting all your hard work in this video that was beautiful I love your videos can you can you post more videos like this lake with some other animals like turtles and stuff you're so beautiful I loved it thank you so much for making your videos can you please make a video on the weekend
I just bought baby quail at the farm supply store near me for $8.29 ..  you said 40 quid.. How much is that?
😍😇😂🤯😱👍🏻🫶🏻🐤🐣🐥
I know what it’s like incubating eggs. You get so invested in the little beings. I had best success with chooks giving random eggs to a very broody little bantam. She sat on 14 normal sized hen eggs. Statistically, I should have got 50:50 male female. I got 12 gorgeous white frizzle male bantams and two huge black female hens. Oh well.
So cool I'm going to try out that some day SO COOL
Food
Dumb video🙄 quail are very hard to sex so there are always males running with females so there is a high chance that shop bought quail eggs are fertile  Also no point in candleing eggs before you have set them as they haven’t been incubated and won’t show any development until they have been set for a few days
That is amazing wow
What happened to the animals in the bedroom ecosystem?
Hey Jay, do you live in London or something? I want to know.
55% hatch rate from supermarket eggs is insane
I'm never eating eggs again😢
Your the acter from small foot aren't you!?
Can you make a pt two of exposing this egg brand
Get him to 2m!!!
My fav part
Yoo like I legit just had the same experience but with a better twist and this time not from the supermarket but from the living bird (dove) and it was a hell of an experience, keep up the good work 🙏🏾🙏🏾
My girlfriend sister did this with tortoise heaters now she has 14 quails
Just to clarify, these hatched because they are Quail eggs and they are new in the market but standard eggs will not hatch because they are not Fertile, the main reason is that fertiling standard eggs is pretty expensive as they are cheap. I have myself tried to hatch them😂

I got my ducklings from Zoey, she is EGGcellent!!

Scientifically you can't do that eggs have to be fertile in order for them to hatch so scientifically you can't hatch an egg out of a supermarket cuz they're not fertile# School taught me this
The legend has been chosen the man the great man he is him he's the greatest man to do this
congratulations on your two quails I love them. They are so cute
😢

Let’s go
🥺🥺
Wow ❤ love from India good to see your efforts towards nature.
QUAILS FOR THE WIN!! ❤🎉
What happen to the chicks after?
pikachu hat = sub
Man learns that eggs can hatch and produce life.
Here in The US the chicken eggs here are not fertile. But quails are.
I will do the same thing  with pastured rise eggs....
oml I want one so baddddddd
CONGRATS!!!!!
What do they need to eat after they hatch?
AWWWWWWWWW
Omg
6:57 omg….
6:31 bro weined and wept 😅
Looks like sainsbury’s gonna get a little angry..
I have done it many times
Id be really disgusted to open up an egg to fry and have a fetus pop out O.O  i think that would ruin them forever for me
This cracked me up, accent makes it priceless
How much is the incubator?I clicked the link and it doesnt show the price
Life find's a way
This video made me feel so suprised
This video brought me pure joy. I forgot halfway about the army hinted in the title so I was surprised when I saw the 300 eggs. Wish you luck in your parenting journey.
I know I came late to this amazing Chanel, but I love it how you love testing the theory and bring these animals that were ment to be food a live even though a lot of people eat these eggs or animals, and I am so grateful you saved these beautiful baby chick's I love this video and you thank you once more ❤
Beautiful ❤❤❤
In a few years if you buy eggs the government gonna be checking houses-
It’s crazy how I started watching you at 100k followers now you have 2mill 🤯
Trust me I’ve had to Quail
I would make the cage taller and put a roof on it cause quail can fly
Nah that song😂
mate this was the best video ive ever watched
My fav animal is chiken pls can I have one pls❤
What did you do with the chicks? Are they someone's pets?
:0
I'm   trying too 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤ On the 1st of may 2024
Got my SUB... QUAIL ARMY LETS GO INVADE RUSSIA 😂❤
You know what my mom actually did it when he was a kid who was a kid
My teacher buy 24 eggs then we put them in the incubator its in lockdown 11 hatched so far!
Yay🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Yo can you show us a video of the baby or picture of it today?
Made me so excited !!!!
Yayyyy❤❤❤❤
You are good bro ❤❤❤❤

Does jay have to pay child support ? I don’t know but what ever
Imagine getting your contract taken because a random YouTuber hatched a lot of eggs 💀

This video  made me the happiest  I've  been for a while  i am vegetarian  so i am so happy
Keep up with the great work mate❤
Could you try an army of ants
And because that type of egg specifically and not the regular ones doesn't want to fool us 98% don't eat those eggs.
It's the nation of quail's
You should make this a Netflix documentary
I would feel so good if I hatched an egg I would cry
WOW
So cute!!!!!!!!
The substance at the bottom is for their 1st breath. A huge clump of air.
Give me your moneyyyyyy!!!! I will buy thousands of quils And donate me your engquibater... Isubscribeeeeee❤❤❤❤
THE ARMY HAS BEGUN.
I am had some chickens, and she managed to hatch quite a lot of them
You're doing a great job
Don't  they  peck each other?
❤ im hatching  ducks right  now ❤ im so happy ❤.  New life is beautiful 😍
I have 3 chicken eggs that were abandoned by their mother,right now im just incubating them and they are showing signs of life.
That's a feat! But how do you feed them just after they hatched? Is there a special ailment for chicks, or what?
Im crying
I’m watching when he has 1.99m
What are you planning on doing with the 100 roosters though?
Alert an entire army is rising!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi it's me again I actually have a city and a hotel named after me
army of eggs
😂🎉❤YaS🥰😍🤩🤍🐤🦚🦜🐦🐧🐥🕊️🦅🦆🦢🐔🐓🐣🦃🦩🦉
Y'all, I personally think scientist could bring back dinosaurs.So chickens and some other modern animals evolved from dinosaurs, so if we can find a dinosaur egg which is the un evolved specie of an animal, we could use the stuff Jay used to hatch the quails in this video.
This isn't Related to the video or any sort of chicken thing or whatever but I have recently made a apple seeds sprout about a few weeks ago and it's already got four leaves but the top is just falling down a little probably because of the weight
You actually did it good job 😀
Hah! Eat egg shells, Sainsbury!!! lol X>
Are you a british men.
I rarely comment on videos but I enjoyed this one. You’re a cool guy, you got a new subscriber!  Im gonna watch the ecosystem video next :)
They looked liked zombie while hatching
Me watching this while eating egg 🥚
This make me wanna go vegan 🥲
This is funny to me because in the US, at least one egg out of every crate I buy is fertilized. You can tell by the little white string-ish looking thing that hangs off the yolk when you crack it into a bowl. I never thought it was a big deal. Maybe next time, I'll think of hatching one.😂
This is what I’m doing when I get free will
I don't have an incubator but I really want to try to do this  how can I do it ? Can you tell me? I really want a chick
nice
You got all these from super market eggs? They are super supposed to have no males in the pen because you eat them. That was a lot of chicks too.
Then

Wait the army of quill was the eggs for them bought from the supermarket as well
I cannot believe they hatched that is incredible I mean I seen chickens hatch their eggs out of mud puddles and s*** but damn
He's right about a lot of the things he said like the refrigeration part but the thing about eggs is you got to rotate them and roll them to keep the sperm fresh in the egg all the way up until the day you put them in the incubator so that might be a problem
This is so cute and I basically can’t express how I feel about this video,I mean I can’t believe you had a first video and now your hatching a whole bunch of eggs,it makes me so happy that the eggs would become a plate of food, it would become FOOD, this makes me so happy that you also have a heart and I’m not the only one so thanks for doing this and for giving a life to they cute baby’s.
Imagine being yeah your from Sainsbury’s and you were born when your owner was playing war zone
I have a cat. Your quails are considered dead.
Sir colonel the rest of the quails are hqtcing🐥🐤🐤🐥
You should sue that brand, you really should!
1.99m subs. So closeee

Life’s a work of art a gift from God you have raised some little dude who is going to be an a huge part in history, you have created life a gift from God. God loves us all God created everything this little guy. He has a life ahead of him.
this is fake, there is no chance that embrio would survive after supermarket fridge, you are a scam
Now you need to find a quail cookbook. Roasted Quail, Bacon Wrapped Quail, Stuffed Quail with Cranberry Sauce, Christmas Quail, Quail and Dumplings.
Can you name one chubby
This is dope lmaoo
So, what are you going to do now that you become the commander of an army of baby quails 😂? You gotta separate the female and male in the future or you gonna be in a huge trouble.

Bruh the youtuber “the chick called Albert” did this with albert and albert 2
very nice
I’m gonna do the same
I was convinced that the first hatch was authentic until he said that he was going to hatch an army, then i got suspicious. Those eggs that were hatched in the amazon incubator couldve easily came from wherever he got the army of eggs
⭐amazing now u have a buckit of💅🌟chicks🌟💅
I'm having chicks at school
My so happy
Congratulations. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I'm so happy for you. I wanna breed them to but I'm renting. 😢
Thank you God ! it so miracle the egg can hatch,i don't believe if i buy chicken egg in minimarket or warung can hatch like that too
Were the eggs you bought in a fridge?  Or were they in room temperature?
Yeah I'm still eating eggs lol. In the words of Red Foreman from That Seventies Show "but the yellow part is the baby bird...that's the part I wanna eat!"
So what I’m hearing is I need a army of my own
I love how you cep trying

I hatched some quail eggs while living in a modern city, living in a small apartment, unfortunately i had no place to give them to, so I contacted anime sanctuaries but they redirected me to my local anime control.  And.... they were all euthanized....

Did you let them go
Yo what is so cool🎉🎉🎉

In America all our eggs are refrigerated, so we could never do this. I also think we can only buy chicken eggs.
I love how you just saved 300 little quails😊
Unbelievable! Congratulations!

I love birds there so cute☺️
Is this supposed to happen? Arent supermarket eggs not supposed to be fertilized? Also why were the eggs just in a box on a non refridgeraged shelf...
What are you going to do with all your quails
You got me to subscribe lol
lol a feel good make you smile video!❤️🥰
Loved the video!!!♥️ I was just wondering if you were ever going to use the incubator again? I would love to have the one u used to replace my little busted up one... I'm not financially capable right now to upgrade 🙏🙏
Hatching chicks was the best experience for us as homeschoolers taught my kids so much and a life skill! 🎉
I feel like the only bad thing about this is kids are gonna waste their money gambling to hatch.. quails. or perhaps chickens. They will then get really sad when they lose all their money and get no life.
hey jay! ive been watching you for many years now and i wanna ask. what happened to romel and like felan and luke. i havent seen them on youtube for ages
Can you please do this with chicken eggs?
and thats how the clone army was made
Ngl my heart broke watching this video
JUST A MERICIL
……i thought you needed sperm
I really hope that you have done research before you got the eggs! If the egg is fertile and you dont know and you move it around, it can deform the chick in the embryo and possibly kill it. Also, sometimes there can be late signs of life in quail eggs. But anyway, congratulations to the new baby quails!
NAME IT coco
Hi jay big fan
Omg im vegetarian but now i cant bring myself to eat eggs 😮 BTW  I work in Sainsbury’s, so next time I serve sonebody buying those little eggs, I will tell them all about whats happened!
I’m gonna go eat some quail eggs now I’ve never had em

Gone off eggs . I got egg before  blood in it.  Had 2 chickens because my son went buy car and tought car no good so lets get ma 2 chickens my little girl play chasing with them 1 was clevev other stupit. But they never tought get house for them
😢😮omg sml did program on puppet sit on egg n turn into chicken puppet wonder did day got story from this story?
I put it in the fridge but I saw moving a few days later but my sister dropped it😢
What happened with Sainsbury? Did you tell them???
I actually hatched two chickens from some supermarket eggs here in the USA.. didn’t expect it to happen
Should have watched @chickcalledalbert
I had a chicken as a pet in school. it turned out to be a cock eventually and we took it to the farm... No, like really, I went with to check ou the farm. There were tonnes of chickens running around. But Bliep was a super cool pet. One of my favourite animal experiences in life.
Hou do you do it
Youtube plz sub

Infinite food glitch...
Hello
And by the way how big are the chicks, probably taking up a lot of space
I am just 10 yrs old and managed to hatch 2 quails out of 10 eggs and they are now fully grown
I want one 😂
Back then my white hen had eggs and we candle them and there is veins but just 14 days after its now gone and i was about to quit my golden brown hen had a eggs we we candled them we saw a littl circle with veins i was so excited and it hatced in day 22 and now i have 3 chicks but there a last egg that didn't hatch but we didn't know whay to do but one day our white hen had gone broody so we gave it to the white and it was successful now i have 4 chicks and am hoping to hatch one of the eggs in my white hen.
I cried at the sign of life, and when they hatched I can't describe this feeling I was having 😭❤️❤️
Being a rep from the egg company we will no longer sell egg starting today we will only sell quails thank you.
There so cute man i’m so happy for you to have quails 😊😊😊😊.
we need an update! this was amazing bro!

300... Gd lmfao u be going all out 😂😂😂😂
Lol u cried huh lol sounds like u just got done crying ur so sweet haha it is a beautiful exciting experience when I put so much into it especially just for the sake of saving a life ❤ that alone is beautiful n yes being born is exhausting lol humans sleep for days after being born u have to wake them to eat the first 3 or 4 days
I will never eat eggs again
Once they r refrigerated u can no longer hatch them anyways... Most don't know but fresh eggs shouldn't have to be refrigerated for a period of time and will go bad faster if u immediately put them in there u also shouldn't wash em they have a natural film which keeps em good longer too but u can tell when u crack an egg if it's fertile or not if UK what u looking at lol and no just bc it's not bloody doesn't mean it wasn't fertile if it is bloody means the chick started to grow b4 the egg reached refrigerator once refrigerated they lose their fertility also if u touch the egg too much n take it out every day spinning it around like I just seen u do on here it'll kill the chick u should leave it in the incubator please
Bro created  a quail farm bro's gonna get alot of exp
Omg I’m gonna cry they are so cute you did amazing job hatching them Jay🐣🐥 I love this video ❤❤❤❤❤❤

Your reactions to the heartbeat ❤❤❤  I’ve actually bought chicken eggs from Publix here in Florida, and I did have to buy2 dozen cartons though and I was able to get 2 chicks they’re happily living their lives on my farm.
I searched in Google and it says it's not possible to have a chick from a grocery egg purchased. That was a fake. I think
Congratulations🥰🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🫡🤗

Omg there So cute
This is intense, I love your content.  Keep up the great work. The amount of effort and quality are both top notch.
You can’t hatch eggs from the store do you know they are not fertilized
I was fishing 3 days ago and found a small random egg on a cliffside and I knew it wasn't gonna make it so I brought it home and now I'm hoping to see if it will hatch ❤ love watching this video
Good job
What you do with them
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
How do I know if this video is fake?
😂🤣😂😂🤣😂 couldn't stop laughing 😆 best entertainment in a long while ❤
Omg im bird in shell
#savethechiks!🥹🥹🥹🥹
bro i almost cried because of those two quails
Once in a Waitrose egg there was a fully formed dead chick! 😢 that was like 2008/2009.
yea well, i hope i was one of ur new on this video, just subscribed 🙂
You’re not supposed to candle on day 1 because you will literally not see anything, which is why you didn’t see anything, and then later on you did. Plus, who is your “quail expert”? Because they obviously don’t know that you can’t tell between male and female button quail except for males crowing, which means the places that sell eggs to supermarkets actually quite often have males in the cages
😊😮
OMG
after watching this,ima try it lmao
This reminds me of good times
What are you going to do with them when they grow up?
Everyone sub
Only hope: ❌ Ownnlly hoppe: ✅
I have 17 chickens in total
Genius
Army of chicks😊 So cute❤. No one would belive that this crazy experiment realy comes to a happy end.
Maybe they think your their mother??
I Love you
gimmie one they are so cute!
I could go for a BQQ bacon cheeseburger, large order of fries, orange soda with no ice and a hot apple pie  -Coach lfd2

💔
I have always wonder myself. Sweetest little animals.
I can’t believe that
They run to your hand because they just hatched them and they think you are their dad and now there are gonna thing their gonna become that big
FAKE VID THO MATE!!  Commercial egg producers only have HENS and no Male Chickens on site so chance of this happening is like 1 in a million
So what you gonna do with all these 100 baby chicks ? 😂
😲😲😲😲😨
This made me me so happy
Fried quails for the price of eggs What a steal
Welcome to the world little guy, youre from Saintsbury's I bet he is thrilled jay
wow cool video you're guys are the best
This is why, Jay is the greatest.  Who does this? He's just a different breed.
Sorry 1 out of 8.33333 percent
There’s a 1 in 8.333333 chance every egg has an embryo
I feel......happy
Thank you for hatching these eggs and god😮😂😂😂😂😊😊😊
Oh, those look cuddly. :-) What are you going to do with them now?
Incredible mate 😅 so wholesome
Definitely not filmed in the USA lol I’ve questioned if the eggs here are even from animal 😂😂😂
Enjoying this new comback youve got going, keep it up
You should try to grow a cow from a veal chop.
There are literally so many plant-based options for protein. You don’t need to eat eggs or meat.
I really hope people don’t start trying this. It’s all well and good for a video, but they are going to grow, shit everywhere and ultimately need re-homing or slaughtering. Didn’t mention the racket they make either?
this was such an emotional video.. ik it’s crazy, coming from jay swinglers channel😭
How to get free kfc
So exciting to see them hatch
even if someone in my family doesn’t finish their eggs,we make sure to give it to our dog so we don’t waste it and he gets healthier
so cool
As a vegan its hella crazy and it def will make you all think about your food before you eat it
11:25 r u OK bro
Wawlamsohappy❤😮
I do like animals and pets
I am from Telford and might give this a try following your advice.
My gf watched this just a day after you uploaded it and hasn’t eaten a egg since😂
Quails frequently have great hatching rates from store bought eggs - but not tried chicken eggs. Here in US anyway :)
We need Sainsburys to reply
ai thumbnail lazy
Get Jay to 2 million,0.03 million left, 3000 subs
Day 18!!!!!! 🐥🐣🐤
This is so cute🙂
We better get updates on this
😁😄😁😄😁😄😁😄😁😄😁😄
One, two... a box... but it would have NEVER ocurred to me to hatch that many 😅 when I hear that an animal (who is living at my home) is a social animal, I inmediately think it is my duty to provide them company, but I guess the quality of the company of a fellow one (or a hundred of them) can't be compared!! Thanks for sharing and surprising me!!! 🐣🐣🐣
Only problems if someone knows you hatched them
We can buy fertile eggs
Why is Jay getting and giving baby fever with chickens😂😂😂...you should name them after tgf memories 😂come here little SMARTIES MCFLURRYY😂😂😂
Would u guys get mad if I said I got hungry while watching this
"If you hatch one- you're gonna piss every corporate attachment off." And Jay took that personally- and said ''Bet.''
I have about 20 chickens, and one rooster
MashAllah ❤ science is still unable to asnwer so many questions of this mysterious world.
This is amazing🎉
Amount of times I’ve cracked an egg into a pan and it’s been half developed 🤢
Gotta love the ai generated thumbnail (obvious sarcasm)
please please do with a normal chicken egg
Brinsea incubator. Good choice. Soooo... Ya gunna eat quail?
We get fertilized eggs every now and then from the store, you can tell after you crack them when theres a little red cord on the yolk... But we're in the us and they come refrigerated
So surprised it worked. I knew you can do it!
this is the best video ever
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤟
8:55 song name???
really cool how you show people how to  do this
the fact that he did it first try is magical
holy
So to make it clear to everyone who might think this is some supermarket conspiracy…. Only a fertilised egg (male bird required) can contain a chick. a female bird on its own lays eggs but without fertilisation it’s just an egg I.e the product you want to buy. Can you imagine if half of your eggs had half grown bird foetuses inside?? That’s why supermarkets ‘don’t want you hatching eggs’  👍
i have chickens my self and we hatch eggs every year, so my question is where do you want to get your chickens to live cause your backyard seemed pretty smal
If you didn’t do that then that poor baby would have been eaten keep saving lives 😊😊😊😊
I raised finches but just remember God gave us animals and eggs to eat so don’t let it change your mind about eating them.
This isnt even possible. This video is fake. The eggs you get at a supermarket are rifridgerated, and not only that they also come from infertle chickens
2:00      🪄TA - DAAAA   look what I can do, well look what Jay did!! Mthrfkn magic is what Jay did! Seriously though I wonder how many people got FIRED, shit canned, let go, don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya, sacked, axed, eighty-sixed❓ IF this is something that is like "forbidden" in the industry well then I think our boy Jay definitely as they say "ruffled some feathers" HA HA HA HA
7:50 not the baby monitoring camera
12:23 ----------- I kinda think I would like that though LMAO  come on how phucking cute would that be to be surrounded by hundreds of baby quails running all over the place around me!! I'd be scared to move as to not hurt one of them and I'm sure I'd get quail 💩 on myself at some point, hey maybe that's going to be the next new skin care product- quail poop! Yeah we can sell it as it will minimize pores and help stop acne you never know. Since half the things labeled "supplements" don't have to even have the product in it that they are even selling why not be able to sell quail poop as a face mask .... I just let my ADHD totally take over I went from visioning a cute little quail army to damn quail poop face masks....WOW LMMFAO hope someone got a laugh at least- and don't go putting poop on your face it doesn't do anything for your pores or acne!!!!
This video was so dramatic 😂
What a uplifting  video. Just awesome.
❤😂
God diggity damn how the hell did YouTube comment on your f****** video also congratulations on the army
Where are they going to live
i subbed....i actually never subscribe to anybody fr......but u ARE AMZING
I think TGF should come back😢
I really don’t see what’s the big deal, we just went from breakfast to dinner 😋
This can never happen in the United States. For one thing, all eggs here are refrigerated and secondly, they might become mutant GMO birds if they did hatch!
This video is telling me that quail eggs arent pasturised the way chicken eggs are, hense the refrigerate after purchase. So it seems theyre not as strictly regulated as chicken eggs.
Go to war at the shop
Imagine if there was one chick in like 1000 quails 😂😂😂
insane vid, huge props
Wow congrats
The third paul brother?
What you gonna do with them when they grow mature 😢
Chicken Nuggets 🤤
YouTube you have to get him a play thing!!!!!!!!!!!!
11:26 funni
My husband did this in elementary school with a duck egg and he hatched. Named him Popeye and he followed him everywhere.
ive had birds my whole life, dude jay really did his research everything was perfect im very impressed.
😮😮😮😮😮
Also congratulations on being a father
I always asked my mom why these eggs from the supermarket won't hatch when I was like 5 years old and then she said it's a special type of chicken that lays eggs for us to eat
Your in trouble nowwwww😮!!! Lol 😆 so freakin adorable tho🥰 congrats on your lil hatchling ❤️
Hello
I would’ve subscribed if you hadn’t tried to be misleading. Still incredible, but quail and chicken eggs are different
U could stop eating eggs and start eating quils.. i heard they are dellightfull😂
Jay literally just called it omg I don't now what to call it omg so did He name it omg 🗿
Amazing life is beautiful..why waste a good thing
Imagine the vegan  teacher. Gave him a 💯
Can u make a part 2 on the birds I would like to see more content on them😅
I  am going to ckri
What did the store say when you bought all of the eggs
This video proves that anything is possible
😀
Damn Jay's changed a lot
That is amazing
12.58 time there ariseing
the rise of the empire.
Thats a massive army lol litterally 193 (what happend to the other eggs just asking)
Give us a update on the chicks
So a chick can be In someone stomach
What a load of crap. The eggs at the supermarkets are not fertilised.
SO CUTE AND ADORABLE!!!!!!!
I was so surprised when the quail egg had a hart beat 🥹😇 it was a sign of life
Hell yeah man I wanna do that
Why are they not refrigerated?
They said it was impossible but even the word impossible has the word possible in it.  Btw, what did the super market say?
Congrats! 🎊🎉🎈 ^_^
Bro literally made everyone’s childhood dream come true of hatching supermarket eggs 😂💀
I love birds and hate any slaughter houses for birds so this is nice
Do The 🐣 chain in the Replies
POV : that one unemployed friend on a Tuesday
He could anything and it’d be funny
Do you still have them

I'll never eat eggs again...
Jay, I think you're totally mad! But such a warm-fuzzy, sweet madness just brings tears to my eyes! ❤
Jay, you're absolutely adorable spouting out all of your joy at these babies quailies! ❤  I can only imagine how you're going to react when your first child is born. ❤
There was a young Australian guy who did this a couple of years ago. As far as I remember, he ended up keeping the hatchling as a housepet. I remember that quail being a really amusing little feather brain. And the dude said that after that he couldn't ever bring himself to eat eggs again... understandably.
You’re did not hatch an army: you hatched an Air Force
Bro this is sick keep this up
Please make a video raising frogs!!
So wonderful to see these little babies brought to life. What did you do after they hatched though? I think I read somewhere they live on average 1.5 years.
IM CRYING RN BROOO I CANT BELIVE YOU DID IT!!!IM SO EMOTIONAL NOWW
Thank you for giving these quail a chance at life, amazing to watch them develop. Subbed :)
The 2 first ones were actually family ❤️
There is a channel called ' a chick called albert'. The man hatched a supermarket egg twice. Not kidding
I had a baby chick in my egg once, and watching that video just made me regret that I didn't check the package before cracking the egg on the pan...
We need to get updates on them
30k more subs that 2m
Hi I really want to own quails but aren’t sure if they are hard to keep up with anyone know anything on that?
I do want to point out that there is quite literally no life in the eggs before you start incubating them, the life only starts growing when you genuinely try to make them do so, otherwise, they're just fertilized regular lifeless eggs.
Your a dad now
How would this work anyway if when you purchase the eggs in the supermarket they're cold
It's not abnormal, quail can start laying around 8 weeks old (chickens are more like 6 months)  so then younger hens can wind up fertilized before the males and females are separated. It's not intentional but almost unavoidable depending on if you can feather sex the type of quail you're raising or not
I love this video but like what will u do when they are adults??
Why do these types of video always use quail eggs and not just a cheaper chicken egg?
13:12 the rise of the jay empire
Cute ❤️I am from Antigua 🇦🇬😍🙋🏾‍♀️
You've just turned me vegan ❤
Hell yeah I'll let those quails defeat me they're so cute they hatched from a freaking store-bought egg that deserve it
Bro YouTube commented
A chick called albert channel core
Jay is a W for doing this
QUAILS… ARISE
I’m letting the quails defeat me
OMG THERE SOO CUTE
bro nailed it
You’re making me cry at 6:15 it is so nice to just watch this video just play out and see life starting to develop in something that seemed hopeless
This is so cute i was going to cry in happiness
ur awesome
When is tgfbro coming back?
I literally love this so much
This wouldn't work for Chicken eggs from the store so this vid is kinda pointless
ittttttttttsssssss alive !!!!!!!!!!!!        ittttttttttsssssssssss aliveee!!!!!!!
Everyone the eggs  have hacht everyone run😂😂😂😂
And this is why I'm vegan!
Wish you could have avoided the click bait and just called it hatched Quail eggs. Hen eggs we buy from super market are not fertilized. Hence you dont get chicks off them. Now thumbs down and am off.
So what do he do with all those birds?
In my opinion u should try chicken eggs to see if they are different
Jay I really want to make a quail army now they are so cute and can’t believe that u could even hatch one ( this made me have to subscribe
Jo was ein Huans*hn, Osten auf die 1
0:03 The shape 💀
Now ur a father
what the hell 😂😂
I’m sorry but this is actually the best video you have never made
Im definitely subscribing that was amazing
The end was just so cute that you let all the tiny quail out and meet their new family
-yoooo YouTube-
Tgfbro?
Oh my gawd
That’s crazy

My name is Zoey 😮😮😮😂😂😂😊😊😊😊
I knew there was something wrong with eggs
DAME
I'm going to cry 😭😭😭😭😭 I'm so happy for you
I know the quail army can win
🧢🧢🧢 as a chicken man myself and owner of chickens currently all egg that come from the supermarket r not fertile they dont got a cock in the pens with them all the cock r sent to slaughter houses and that r the one we eat and the hens but most hens r kept for eggs and r all together. so no rooster in there. most hen don’t require a rooster to step on them, to lay eggs and all need a rooster to have fertile eggs.
In the reptile breeding community, there is a saying.. incubate until there is no debate.
Im loaning some of ur quails
2024
Happy Easter
Every time I watch this video I weep, it’s so beautiful and sad
The over people on YouTube who do it make it fertil on there own (they have done this with fish eggs)and it's cruel that you can do this cuz you might have eaten one😢😢😢
😢😢😭😭🥲🥲🥲🥹🥹🥹🎉🎉🙏🙏
subscribed :)
These quails are so much, super cute! ❤️  Thank you for saving their live from becoming a human food 🥹 It’s a lots of quails 😊
When he candled the unincubated eggs— eggs need to be under heat for at least 2-4 days to see any sort of embryo/development. The lines in the one egg is just weak points in the shell
Wow pretty crazy but awesome
When new video
Hey dudes are you now convinced to be pro life? We love these silly birds and I loved my chickens I’ve had. I try my hardest to have people show children how life starts. Please share because this is amazing watching birds development.
So cute and I have a quails 😊
can u make more of this i love it
(you really put so much effort and put so much money into baby quail eggs so as @byjayswingler said getting out of your comfort zone can mean a lot so never give up )
Someone else did this
This is the first video I have watched from you I love it I subscribed and liked it continue your great work
The ai thumbnail is crazy
Bro is god

YOUR VIDEO WAS GREAT!
I’m just happy there’s not a bunch of vegans in the comments lmao
what a legend,saving these poor eggs from being eaten by evil humans.
6:34 he sounds like hes gonna cry. Thats how you know this is real, pure excitement and 0 fake reactions❤
I have never eaten eggs in my life and when I saw this vid I was like I have to show my dad he eats eggs every chance he gets😂
He knows what he was doing with that egg in the beginning
Meanwhile, the supplier literally getting fired
9:37 9:42 what happened with these two eggs?
Wait, the eggs arent already refrigerated in store? As someone from the USA, its nuts seeing eggs just sitting on shelves
To everyone doing their homework, breathe slowly, take a sip of water, and focus.  To everyone who is trying to sleep, leave the chat, grab a blanket, and get the rest you deserve.  To everyone who is sad, grab a snack, have some water, get a blanket, and write down your thoughts. When you're done, lay down and get some rest, no matter the time.  To everyone who is creating, you got this. Your creation looks terrific. Remain in your flow and get stuff done!  These are not my words but spread them and copy paste
Congrats what’s there names?
They are so cute. I'm glad they will get to live out their lives in a safe place.
Just to let you know you’re supposed to stop the egg rotations a couple days before they are due to hatch But other than that you’ve done a great job at looking after them  Congratulations on your new babies
😢
k lemme go to walmart to get some eggs rq
🎉 The quails live
Bro don't just leave them in the incubator!
Wtf is with zoomers and hand holding tiny lav microphones? It's so daft.

You should make a army of ducks.
Oh OMG so cute 🥺❤
Jay is awespme but using ai to make your thumbnail sucks
This video reminded me that I when i was young I tried to hatch eggs from supermarket. My mom bought eggs and me who overwatched egg hatching videos stole one of them and made a imitation of nest from towels, but then my mom found it and said that supermarket eggs have no embryo in it 😂
Save the eggs and you are a dad
You know it’s real YouTube itself is commenting on this
In my school we rised baby  chicks  it was really  fun

I remember when I was young like about 5 when I got a chicken egg for breakfast I put it under a lamb and tried to hatch it 😂
So their ferterlised eggs iv been told that eggs have to be ferterlised to be able to hatch
I'm so happy that you made so many chicks alive that's actually so cute congratulations of getting the quails to life
Awawawawawawawaswaawawawawawawawaw. It's. So.  cute

They aren’t fertile if the chickens don’t mate, so it’s like trying to have a baby without doing *you know what*
E
It's like Lucifer getting a real army of chickens
Wow exciting 😂😂
I would of kept the two that where hatched first as they must be missing you now
8:25 9:40  10:45
This wholesome content >>>>
bro that is the coolest thing ever
🙂
No wonder you cant stomach the eggs, burnt the fkn toast lad :D Great video!
Next thing you know "this is Sainsbury's! OPE-"
this vid made me hungry
This means war chickens 😁
Hay um can you hatch flamingo eggs?❤
I have that same incubator lol
Great video and loved how excited you were through the whole process. Just a couple of points, you can do this with most (organic) eggs including Quail, Chicken and Duck because they often have roosters as guards against foxes. The fertilised eggs are perfectly safe to eat and leaving them in your cupboard will not make them hatch as they temp and humidity needs to be just right. They say to refrigerate them as they will have been washed which removes the protective bloom and they will go off quicker if left in a warm room. Also you are meant to turn off the automatic turners 3 days before they hatch so for Quail day 15, Chickens day 18 and Ducks day 25... just for next time ;)
No they’re not fertile eggs and even if they were the cold fridges would kill the embryos
He is
Where you getting all these nice hats from 😂
What do you think you should name the baby chicken😊
I am going to do that
Great man
The shape of the egg man
Next video, I revived the dinosaurs and made world peace..
There hatching there uniting planet earth is gonna be conquered from the army of quails made by jay Swinger
Congratulations, you own a chicken now.
U should call it Sainsbury’s
No way is it you from the moss room! No freaking way! I loved this video btw... absolutely incredible!
The shaking, the egg, that's how you kill it.
The chances of you doing that's like 1 in 100. It's not the most efficient way out to do it. Just lose Oxford, good eggs. Some companies just try to get one of the child over and back Some companies just try to get one of the Chiropractic.
Truck me chickens will be dominate Mexico. Trust me, chickens on a path of the planet.
Didn't on photo I just mean that you can't, you can't change them into a living.You need to actually hold chicken with a man to actually make action like baby chickensDidn't on photo I just mean that you can't, you can't change them into a living. You need to actually hold chicken with a man to actually make action like baby chickens. Well there Oh, you needed?I asked the whole man goes another chicken And a woman. And then uh, if it's photo wise, it will catch.
It's not that many. Cause chickens, really dominate the plant.
But now I’m never eating eggs again
I want a bird):
those birds gonna have to call him papa jay
now you can make chicken nuggets
"I bet hes cheating on me right now"  Meanwhile him:
Congrats
I am so happy for you,and hopefully they hatch
Marsh mallow(new subscriber)
That happened to me once! my grandma was making an birthday cake, and she put the eggs in. to her surprise, IT WAS AN ALIVE CHICK! so this actually is true! no joke.
But here's so cute can I please have him😢
The big bird army is coming……
Q U A I L A R M Y
the vegans after realising that they can save the chickens
don't you people know about Albert -_-
The pure exitment on youre face is amazingg i love these
You may have had a better hatch rate if you put the pointed end down and the air sack up. Sometimes the air sack can detach and rot the egg if it on the bottom. And it harder for them to hatch if they are upside down.
LET'S GET TO 100.000
This picture made me be warm on my life. I liked it Andy Marti.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
You are a daddy
please take care of the quails right🥺
Try 1000 eggs and see what happens
OK we subscibe
You Should Run Your Own Chicken Farm Those Are So Cute Please Keep Em!❤️🐓
Now am going to feel bad eating eggs
Yippee pee pee pee
Awesome video. I’d have named the first one that hatched Sainsbury. I wouldn’t be able to do anything like this is the USA. They refrigerate the eggs here in the grocery stores, so I’m sure that would prevent them from hatching 🐣 even if they were initially fertile. That fact is the only thing keeping me from trying to do this 😝
This made me smile
I really don't know why anyone hasn't said this yet under any of these youtube videos on people successfully hatching supermarket bought eggs:  All these videos are done by people in the UK or EUROPE. You canNOT do this in the USA or Canada, because the way the eggs are processed there essentially kills the chick before it ever reaches the store in the first place. Hence why there isn't a SINGLE youtube video of this experiment done in these 2 countries,  So, at least if you're American or Canadian, since idk abt other countries besides USA Canada or European countries, please don't watch these videos and then be inspired to try this yourself, and then get puzzled at why it never seems to work, but these youtubers seem to have some crazy magic voodoo luck or something. No. It simply won't happen if you are in USA or Canada. it seems to work, only because the people who successfully do it are from countries where the processing methods happen to allow such experiments to be possible. I have nothing against this youtuber, but theres too many viewers out there who think its so tragic that there are so many chickens who could have had a second chance at life, and they want to do it so bad.
In the Philippines its completely fine they don't care
The first time you have a chance at the top is the second one you get a free pass and you can go on your way back and then go to your car to pick it out of there so I don’t have a ticket for the first time and I can get a ride to your car but you have a free ticket for that and then I have a ride for you and I don’t know how to do that but you have I can go on your own car so I don’t need a ticket to the second and I don’t know what you want but you have a free 😂 so you have a ride home so I don’t have a free ticket for the first one you have a ride back home or something and you can just come on your way home or
12:28 bring the gun ahhhh nooo they killed Timmy
Thank you for doing this , I loved seeing you save/hatch them. It brings tears to my eyes.
I am not going to buy over 10 million eggs
I love animals animals
I'm crying to this is the first time I've ever seen life 😭😭😭😭
I thinck he has subscribe virus
This was awesome I've always wanted to hatch any type of egg from the dollar store it's nice to see someone else wanted to do it to
good save animal
OMG 😳
Congrats on the success of your project.
19,300? + 1:)
So this is where TGF bro has gone well half of it
The clone wars has just begun
Your passion comes through and makes the video special. Thank you.
If I can get  a egg
jk
now cook them eat them and sell them
I don't belive a sanctuary took them. Who's gonna pay for taking care of them for their entire lifes?
I love your vids I love eggs i can not eat eggs no more :).
I FEEL SO GOOD
Graduation on having a army
THIS WAS THE BEST VIDEO OF MY LIFE! YOU TRULY INSPIRED ME TO CHECK EVERY TIME I GET EGGS I AM NEVER EATING A EGG AGAIN ALL OF THEM LOOK SO PRECIOUS I JUST WANT TO SQEEZE IT FOREVER AWWWWWWWWWWWW THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM CONSIDERING TRYING THIS NOW AND I AM SO EXITED OMG JUST WAITING FOR THE DAY OF A PET CHICK
You safe a life
Why? Did you carry the two chickens chickens on A cutting board.
In America I dont think we have any fertilized eggs in the grocery store but you can find free fertilized eggs easily
I started crying because I would’ve ate them
Let's show her wrong!yay we did it we shows her wrong!
That’s crazy! I would love to see how they are doing😍 update video please
Tfg bro???
It melted my heart when they hatched
If you wanna hatch chase, do you have to get quail sperm?
I am so happy for you 😊
this makes me hungry i think im gona get some egges to eat
13:50  THIS PART IS SOOOOO CUTEEEE
Parthenogenesis isn't that rare either. Especially in reptiles like birds. Some species reproduce exclusively this way. If you,attempt to hatch enough infertile eggs you will get some chicks.
that song sounded like the ohio final boss musick
I thougth the market sales unfertilized eggs ??😢
Hey Jay , Love your content ! . Next time start incubating before candling . If those eggs are refrigerated then there is very minimal chance of embryo development , only after a couple of days you can see some veins (Atleast for chicken/duck eggs).
When I saw the chicks, I stopped and thought to myself... "THAT WAS FROM A SUPERMARKET?!"
YOUR AMAZING,,
i mean, i dont see what is wtrong with eating unfertalized eggs, like id eat my birds eggs, after she was done with them becuase was unfertalized, what if coudl drink milk froma  LOVED cow and eggs from LOVED chickens? then i guess its not so bad? but its when they are in tiny cages, or "free range" withh 999999999999999x chickens per 0.01 acres......... infact maby having cowws adn chickens that are LOVED can be a way for "vegans" to geat "animal products" (pacificaly those vegan for not to kill animals, not the vegans that realized plant based was better for them while a meat based better for someone else.)  remember the cow NEEDS a hue-man to milk it or it's in trouble..... so by reducing ALL milk consumption, your eatualy gonna exterminate lots of cows!
I felt so happy that I almost cried 😊😊❤😢
They are being born
yea ill let the quail army to defeat me, then use kitty army to fight back, and save me money  on cat food :3
Is it legal? and if yea I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY ARMY OF QUAILS:)
Iluv❤❤❤❤❤❤
PART 2 PLZ
the fact we live in a world that effing eggs can be copyrighted, jesus showed piracy (magicaly making a copy of something) is a GOOD thing imagine if christ came now and started duping bread adn fish? thinkt he industry would have that ? no they would ARREST the "pirate"! Jesus christ, the FIRST PIRATE!
That’s so cute ❤
ah, cant do this in US since refridgeration kills. my neighbor had a rooster adn he gave me eggs, and tried to hatch them, turned out he got rid of the rooster a dew days before i got the eggs :/.
but i wanna know what ur gonna do w all them chicks, lend us one?
I generated thumbnail

Did all the eggs come from a supermarket?
In kindergarten, we hatched eggs, but Miss stolen did but the chicks was so cute and we got to hold them

They look tasty🍗🍗🍗
well, congrats, now I want to do the experiment too. I already wanted to get quails, so now I'm going to try with supermarket eggs first lol
Make mogul videos when you do the same thing.That's the queues and cuts s*** in x.It's time
"Nah I'd Win" 💯💯💯
If the eggs are fertilized, they already contain life, you're not creating life by hatching them, you're just helping it along.  But commercial chicken farms are very strict about not having any roosters in with the hens, so the eggs are not fertilized. They are more like a chicken's period than a baby chick. Also, the yoke is not the baby chick, it is the food sack that the chick gets it's nutrients from.  My parents have a small farm and have both hens and roosters and they often let some eggs hatch to replace laying hens (which get turned into stewing hens) and get some young roosters for frying chickens (the breading rooster always comes from another farm so you don't get inbreeding). I personally don't have any issues with eating eggs, even if I know they are fertilized. I have more of an issue with eating a stewing hen that I have gotten to know through her years of egg laying.  Though, they also have a couple cows at a time (often rescued from dairy farms where they get cows pregnant just to start their milk production, then they dispose of the calves). They hand raise them and name them and you get to know their personalities... then, every Christmas, we get a half a cow (butchered and packaged to be frozen for a full year's worth of beef). The cows are pampered and live their best life before they are slaughtered. I always think that, if they were living in the wild, they would probably be taken down by a pack of wolves or a bear and it would be a much worse way to go than a shot that they can't even feel. But it's still weird when you think of the cow's name as you eat it. Luna was a cow that they let loose in their apple orchard all the time because she LOVED apples (she'd walk up on her hind legs to pick apples off the trees). It would seem like you could almost taste a bit of a hint of apple in the beef.  I think that all the animals that we eat should have as great a life as possible. Most animals rely on other animals for their survival, including humans. Our bodies are designed to digest meat and our taste buds like the taste of it so much because our body needs it. You'd never put a dog or cat on a vegan diet and call it humane treatment, so why do people do it to humans?
WAHT IN THE WORLD
Egg are normally unfertilized, you shouldn’t be able to feed incubate eggs from a grocery store. I don’t see how a manufacture can get away with selling fertilized chicken eggs, when you crack it open there’d be a small baby chick or underdeveloped chick right?
Do you feed it
ive deff had quite a few eggs come from my grocery store with literal red blobs. so it is 100% possible
Him: Are you really gonna let my army of quails defeat you?  Me: Yes. Yes, i am.❤
Nah 193 Gotta be fake
Bro My mom and i buyed the quail eggs and my mom cooked the quail egg and when i opened the quail egg theres was an litterally a living baby quail cooked so sad man😢
The super market : we’re coming to your house
jay your a legend your making life with a supermarket love and you bro keep it up mb love you I wanna see remell back
Congratulations on discovering the joys of motherhood - in the middle of playing a shoot-em-up game.  And then hatching your own quail army to epic battle music.  Men are many-sided, my friends.  This is a joy to watch in the morning.
Its my first time seeing you're schanel i love it I sub and like
I wish the government dont take tax from you
YouTube is here
Cool vid! I would eat the eggs before, and the quails after they grow lol. They are all delicious
your life is on a cool path
I’m impressed
Jay said I love reading your comments that are paragraphs long. Excuse me but, scroll down bro
This man got so excited
Welp, congrats then.
Have you tried to grow a tree from imported supermarket fruits?
Yo Jay! I am a huge fan can you please comment please Jay : D
I wonder what the company thinks? (can someone please make the company see this?)

wow my friends are famous! Edit: 50 LIKES NOW IM FAMOUS Edit: 80 LIKES I AM SOON THE MOST FAMOUS EGG Edit: 90 LIKES OMG
Cute and interesting, but it’s been done before… there is a channel called “A chick called Albert”….
TO WAR!!!
How did you do that😮😮
I really want to do that, just my mother (yes I am a kid) probably won't agree to it 🙃
Bro i gona cry man i love ot so much 😢
I hatched 3 quails from my eggs !!!!
That supermarket is cooked
If you aren’t pro-life this shouldn’t mean anything to you
Chicken
I have a annowstment: #BRIDDAD
that thumbnail deadass makes you look like jacob seed from far cry 5
A chick called Albert
Seeing how much jay has matured warms my heart. Been here 10 yrs since romell got concussed in a skate park, love you jay❤
Albert would be proud.
anyone else notice what the broken egg looked like in the beginning
this is extremely wholesome
If there is this much excitement to see a baby quail's heartbeat, what does that say about a human embryo?
Cute🙂🙂
Bro egg on toast slaps
all vegan minds be like:
name suggestion (ik you no longer have them) 1) saint 2) berry
Honestly I don't see this happening in the US. For one thing we don't have quail eggs quite as available. Also chicken and duck eggs have to be unfertilized to be sold legally. It isn't just about preventing propagation, it's animal abuse to cook a developing chick while it's biologically alive. Those duck fetuses eaten raw out of the egg are illegal in a lot of countries. Just throwing out there.
you cant hatch supermarket eggs because they are unfertilized
The quails are way too adorable!
Click bait not chickens
I actually got the chills bruh! 6:24
Damn you're so different now! And I love it! I really liked your old vids from tgf, but this is so much healthier and still really enjoyable to watch!!
life. always finds a way.
REALLY COOL,, THANKS ＼(^_^)／

This is absolutely unbelievable! I don't think I'm going to buy eggs for a while. I cried when the first chicken hatched. It was the most wholesome video I've ever seen! I want the quails to win but you deserve +1 sub from me
Spam chick army
They are a super cute army!
You saved so many chicken
Omlet day kids!
Try just get a couple of females and then you can have no more chances of getting a chick in your eggs
This is the best video on YouTube ever in my opinion
omg so cute
lol
Cool maybe I should do this too
WOW THE EGGS!
Thank you for these amazing videos
somebody got fired
A strange thing that can happen with coturnix quail is they can have the wrong feather colors and look like the opposite gender. Some colors they have there is no difference in appearance.
Did you get band from that store
🙀🙀
I don’t feel like eating eggs after watching this.
It’s amazing, but what if markets and stuff do that with their chicken eggs if they do, that would make me feel horrible i’m hoping they don’t do that with the chicken eggs too
Ewwwwwwww😂 I stopped liking eggs a while ago and I’m glad I did , cause EWWWWWW
Well how did the supplier and supermarket react ?? And the specialist ? Come on.
so dumb.. without a rooster the eggs are steril. if you go to organic farm eggs yes.. but most supermarkets are sterile
Amazing video, especially the message at the end!
Ai generated chicks?!
Ih❤😂
AHA JOKES ON YOU BRAIN I NEVER LIKED EATING EGGS TO BEGIN WITH!
Everyone:buys eggs in the store normally to eat them this guy:
The army will riseeeeeeee
thery'e so cute!!! ☺
They think you are there dad
Bro made someones breakfast into someones lunch 🔥
Well whoever had that quill Or whatever it is Their dad definitely left for milk😏😜😅😂😂😂😂😂
its so cute... tysm for saving them
I wonder how many people in here making comments along the lines of how precious these eggs are and how it makes them hesitant to eat eggs in the future throw all of that out the door when it comes to humans. Really bizarre.
I subscribed
my god you are insane you did it!
W
I would like a follow up. Was there any backlash to the company? Any changes to try and stop them putting live eggs in with the food ones?
This is why I don’t eat egg❤❤
OMG,CONGRATS THEIR SO CUTE
Oh my goodness There so adorable
Being you paid for the eggs, you would be better off, putting all the eggs in the incubator. After 7 days candle them to see what you got.
Do caviar
so nice you raised your food so heart warming
This made my day, it's so cuteeeeeeeeeeee 🥹 new sub :D thanks for the video it made my day! 🥹 Thank you so much jay!
My Ms. Proffessional talks like Google translador voice
Amazing praise God :)   Also, Jesus will fulfill you more than anything in this world, I speak from experience (from when i did Romans 10:9-13), he loves you and wants to be in a meaningful (not romantic) relationship with you. :)   “that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭9‬-‭13‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭15‬ ‭KJV‬‬  If you want proof that Jesus and the Bible are true look a documentary called “Ron Wyatt discoveries 2022” on YouTube and a YouTube channel called Expedition Bible. They both examine archeological sites and discoveries that prove the Bible, and even reference secular sources.  (Just don’t convert to 7th day Adventism after watching the documentary) And lastly if you don’t know the gospel and want to be saved search up “abc’s of Salvation Teenmissions” on Google and it should be the first or second result. When you click on it read the whole thing, and do what it says and have faith in Jesus while you are doing it, do not doubt, and if it is hard for you to do what it says, ask Jesus to help you, have faith that he will, and *he will.*  God Bless :)
Yea good luck man
ye im def going vegan... x:
God's creations are so beautiful! It's sad knowing they may never have been born because we eat them. :') Thank you for saving them, and making this video! :)
Fun fact, Chicken chicks cost about 20-70p each, Quail chicks cost around £3
Viva la quails!!!
I did this many years ago and bought 12 quail eggs and out of the 12 eggs i had, 7 hatched. I tried this with duck eggs and from 6 eggs i managed to get 1 hatch.
What else can I do? U got my sub ❤ great project!
Doesnt matter as lond as it fills my tummy
Guys subscribe so we can defeat the quails BTW this video is very wholesome
So Cute!!
ŁØŁ
Wow..👏👏👏.You have much compassion and LOVE ...❤❤❤...awesome ...Thank You so much..🙏🙏🙏.LIFE on this Planet is sooooo precious...💖.( VEGAN  is the Best way ...)
As a chicken owner I would just like to clarify that almost all eggs that you can buy at a supermarket are not fertile meaning that it can’t be hatched because they weren't made with a hen AND a rooster. (your not eating baby chickens if you buy the eggs from a store unless the company is sneaking fertile eggs in) Thanks for the vid!
"I have no enemies"
Had to subscribe after seeing this💯Bless
Bullshit.....supermarket eggs are not fertilised.
They so cut ❤
Lol the fact people believe this video is real is hilarious, you cant hatch unfertilized shop egg 😂😂😂.  You def bought eggs somewhere else that were fertilized
Love these people❤
Just came over from TikTok. Brilliant content.
Cool  video

Go vegan. Quit eating like psychopaths.
" %0 chance " Jay: " Bet " anyway i've hatched chicken and duck eggs in an incubator and it was so cool for me and my family, hope the quails are doing well :) it's so cute that the quails were sticking together and running around :) Good Job Jay :D
Dang it ...we can't have anything.Not even eggs now... So are you going to pay child support now for the Quails?
Btw they are adorable and I would love updates
eggs in America are not fertilized, and their coating is washed off, so we have to keep them in the fridge.
Btw that little thing is air and I have hached eggs so I now
The story about how jay became vegen
Why was he wearing a army suit?
Quails are delicious too.
i just found your channel and i'm already obsessed with the crazy things you go out of your way to do, keep it up dude :)
What are you gonna do with them?
I was waiting for you to call the lady back and show her the supermarket babies
THERE ALIVE 6:38 ❤
Mmm chicken
You are a really good person for this, good job this is great i just had pure joy when i saw the babies hatch
The shape 💀0:04
Life is truly beautiful
You don't kill chick's when you eat eggs lol.
I literally said the same thing with my first chick I hatched "Welcome to the world"
Dude this is a cool video but seeing the clip of the ecosystem room is getting you a subscription because I gotta see that!
I'm sorry for the guy who lost his job because of this
Is it only me that on the start of the video the splattered egg looks like a wener whit some strange stuff on top
i CRIED😢😭😭
8:05 guy counts his chickens before they hatch.
This actually amazing.❤
Bro i was eating rn and when i saw all the new brothers and sisters go with the Amazon birds it made me cry it's soo wholesome im glad my mom left or else she would have seen me cry 😭
I can't believe they actually hatched! Congrats!!!!
THAT SAINSBURYS LOOKS AWFULLY LIKE MY LOCAL ONE
Is this real
Part 2?
i loved this video
Legendary!🤩🥳🤗🐣🐥
finally a youtuber doing actual research before getting living breathing animals
He's the honored one
Anyone noticed the ai generated thumbnail?
Idk how true this is I mean you coulda just swapped eggs next time someone does this they should take pics of the eggs they bought at the market. With the dotted pattern on the eggs so we know it’s not cap
Mate that was a great video, and I loved how that even though you where conducting an experiment you showed such excitement and compassion for these baby quails, it was brilliant well done
How soon did the cease and desist letters start rolling in? 😂🤣😂 Bro had a 193% success rate and someone is going outta business 🤣
The yellow ones remind of my quail that I hatched in 2018
😮😮😮😮😮 oh my gosh
Awwwwwwwww
14:38 eat them
I dont think that the "evil" supermarkets want to keep you away from your pluschy baby chicken friends. They just want to sell an edible egg ! Imagine preparing your breakfast and you notice a litte chicken embryo swimming in your pan. Appetizing hm ?
So unless you’ve faked this video… grocery stores are selling actual baby eggs?  I stopped eating eggs for awhile as a kid because of the trauma of seeing a baby bird broken out of one before it was fully formed.  Now you’re telling me that all the self soothing I’ve done for two decades was entirely meaningless because I could have been eating babies this entire time….
Have you had any contact from the store, egg brand, or supplier yet?

When I was little, I always dream of hatching a baby chick. I remembered one time I grabbed a egg, hid it from my mother, and dig a hole to put the egg inside and run away. I always think that the egg turned into a baby chick, but I never know if had ever hatched. 😂
This is amazing, it just makes me wanna have some quails
The army isn’t big enough
THIS IS MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Keep up the good work love ur vids
Any blowback from the grocery store?
Coolest thing I've seen all day, good on you sir!! Now...would this work on supermarket chicken eggs?
You keep cracking it 🐣 love it gonna try this myself, 💯
The company wont hate you they'll have mixed feelings about it cause you know why? You gave them money which made them happy but at the same time made them angry that you have an army of chicks now (i think theyre angry because he could use these cute little patooties to ya know make money but he wont do that right?)
It's incredible that you are creating life from supermarket eggs, from doomed to die, to blessed with life.
2:39  "someone named a pig after me once" They really did her dirty 💀
we will beat the armyyyy!!!!!!🐣
i,ve never seen your vids before but this one made me subscribe. you,re awesome
He went  missing 1 month after making this video
My man turned breakfast into dinner. Incredible.
It's not the supermarkets!  They give less than a fig what you do with purchased eggs.  It is the breeders who pay dearly for stock that don't want the public getting it for rather inexpensively.  The only role the store has is refrigeration to keep the product safe and fresh, a practice that is counterproductive to successful hatching.  Very interesting video though.  With chicken eggs, most egg laying hen flocks are absent roosters because they are useless in terms of bringing in revenue, so thus the low hatchability statistics you quote.
your so lucky other people took years to do what you did goo job
This is a tribute to “A Chick Called Albert” if you all remember who he is
That’s crazy😅
so either this is fake or a supplier seriously messd up with giving live eggs
My mom boiled a chick by accident🥲😭🥲
free quail nuggets! Yum Yum Yum
worst subscriber pitch ever. Why would I want to defeat those quails theyre adorable
They shouldn’t be able to hatch? Generally these eggs aren’t like fertilized
get a  clear closed top for quail cages🐣
Possibilities are endless If you were a christian the boost is 3x faster Muslim x2 fsst
Everyone should know, you can't hatch eggs from the store, after being on the shelf in the cold for so long the egg is no longer viable.
The birds are so lucky the person didn’t eat them
vegan teacher be like:oh thats a check✅ for you but the eggs in the start were kulled so an x for u
that's quails are so lucky they got a chance to get a life❤❤
This is awful. I honestly thought they only sold unfertilised eggs 😢
Makes me want to hatch a egg now so badly
were the 300 quail eggs from the supermarket aswell?
That broken egg at the start looked like a di¢k
That’s crazy.
did you become a vegan
What have u done my brain cant even process this ;-;
🎉
This made my day ❤
Me and my friend was cooking some eggs, when we crack the egg, there was vines
Im speechless🎉
Bro im not eating no eggs no more 😃
I boughtI bought 2 baby chickens from tractor supply And they are just feathering out

This was the most heartfelt, cute video that ive ever seen. JaySwingler, i wish you the best. you have successfully gained another subscriber of many, many subscribers. and the amount of effort you put into these videos is just phenomenal. So, in turn, ill be posting a drawing summarizing this video on deviant art. Quails #1, JaySwingler - General of the Quail Army
Your army need part2 about they grow but what hapens to the other egg❤
AMAZING JAY! UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING!👍 this has changed my life and when I hear quailes and breakfast in the same sentence your an amazing person jay! Keep up with the amazing work and PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE KEEP THEM! THEY NEED YOU JUST PLEASE KEEP THEM SAFE JAY!!!!!
This is my fist time watching one of his video and I LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOVE THEM❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I didn't even know that could happen.I'm so excited.This see if it actually happens happens and i'm excited as much as you are
I don't know why, after watching this I suddenly have a fear of quail eggs, they for some reason freak me out if very close to the camera and if its dark
You used AI for the thumbnail.
OMG OMG OMG I LOVE CHICKENS I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!
The egg problem is probably how to basic😂😂😂
This actually made me cry with joy 🥹
Given life
I always love watching these kind of projects.
Good chicken nuggets
I wanted to cry on one part
I raise quail here in the US, and this experiment was the bomb! ❤ Now I am going to look to see if you did a follow up on your quail army!
So I’m looking forward to the cook out hopefully your fried quail will be good since you have 193 quails to test with.😊
If anyone of you guys like this, watch A Chick Called Albert. The dude basically fid this stuff first and with more of an emotional story
The cat is gonna have the best dinner in its damn feline life
Oo i live in jamica ive never seen Quail eggs😂
I love this style of video, but the AI thumbnails on YouTube are unbelievably cursed
u know he's not lying because of the reaction
ACCA did this first
I hatched quails a year ago! I completely agree with this and I am so glad that you were successful! I LITTERALLY had the exact same excitement when I saw a vein and I didn’t believe it. Another cool way of candling the eggs is by putting them in Luke warm warmer and waiting for it to go still. If it is half out of the water and half in and it starts to wiggle, you’ve got a future pet quail coming for you. !😊❤
Hi you tube
I don’t think the Sainsburys eggs worked and you planted 2 ones that you got from somewhere else.
Omg you just did the imposible😮😮 ( But i need to know what happend to the other eggs?)
You are a bit of a helmet ⛑️
Is TGF over ?
First time I've seen your video, I only watch Goldshaw Farm. I gotta say, unique video. I loved it 😍 ❤
That lady isn’t that smart . U can get fertilize egg . If it’s not fertilize it will not hatch
I loved the energy you gave off in this video! So fun to watch. So just to ease your conscious a little, bird eggs are laid in a "dormant" state. what that means is that the embryo does not begin to develop until the incubation heat is applied. So when you eat eggs for breakfast, you are eating something that has the potential to become a chick, but it is not yet a chick until incubation begins.
“Someone named a pig after me once”😧
holy shit im never eating eggs again
War
5:15 boutta give lil bro whiplash 💀
😊
So the way eggs get the chicken in them is this   Female chickens lay eggs 24/7   A lil later a male chicken fertilizes the egg  Then the chicken gets an egg  Supermarkets get their eggs by stealing them before the eggs get fertilized
this sounds so fake.
I'm going to stop eating eggs after this
Army of quales vs the supermarket
I've been HOOKED since the beginning of the video! So exciting!!!!!
Hi
7:15 put the egg back in the incubator
Epic
THEIR SO CUTE AND ADORABLE
I didn’t subscribe because I don’t want to kill quails.😂
the best and holsem vid
The animals are so cuteee
I’m eating eggs right now (i’m sorry…)
are you banned from sainsburys yet?
Not all heroes wear capes.
He or she is so cutr
This video made me question the ethics of supermarkets and made me tear up a bit. Truly a moving piece of audio-visual art
quail eggs & not common  chickeneggs . . .  try to do with unfertilized eggs what ppl mostly eat from shops/farms
Very inspiring! Let's save the baby chicks 🐥
I saw this idea in another YouTuber
Hardest way to become a father
Bro is going to war with the us government at this point💀💀💀
Teacettele time, eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey
Sad I could never do this because our eggs are shipped to the store and then stored in the coolers. So they insure it here right away, death… at least in New England
I love ds videos 😍😍
Watching this is breathtaking. After finishing this video, I can’t help but remember the times when I was younger and wanted to do this myself. You proved the professional wrong by doing this and I can’t help but feel shocked and happy and much much more feelings that I can’t even explain.
Can we get an update on the quails
When they go through maturity just know that the male quails will start fighting other male quails so I suggest you separate them (it will be quite obvious btw)
WEEEEE DID IT
The transition on 8:10
He made it look like a movie as well
How did more than half of them hatch? I thought there should have been only one or two per dozen which were fertilized?
I never ate quails.
You made the best vid ever.
Your the best
This give me a thing to love ❤
Always wondered about the English (European?) thing for not refrigerating eggs. They always say that eggs in the US aren’t fertilized, but could they be hatched if they weren’t refrigerated?
This would NEVER happen in the US. *BUT* I wish I could do this
You are a MADLAD, OMG, I have nothing but pride for you.
Only if fertilized.  Eggs are just a period. Bodily fluid.
IN the US most eggs are WASHED  and REFRIGERATED since  they almost always come from egg producers where ZERO roosters are kept, the likelihood of a fertile egg landing in on a kitchen counter from a grocery store is zero
This is a powerful Pro-Life video.   If you in any way want to become vegan because of this video, how can you stomach the thought of Abortion at any point in a pregnancy?  This is a miracle of life.  That eggs can even remain viable that many days after they have been taken from the nest, packaged and sent to the store is amazing in and of itself.  Choose Life!
this is crazy. those farms are going to lose their contact.
Aw, this is freaking awesome!!! You are a great person to save these tiny angels!!! Makes me rethink eating eggs for breakfast....You are a great dad to these babies❤
Well done, you can eat the quails as well.
Can you take over the world?
I love quails
Jay you are supposed to take the automatic turner out on day 15. Congratulations on the outcome of your experiment.
Some absolute BSerity... Not sure why I bothered.....If people believe this I have a great house for sale.
There is a 0001003000001%
This is sick
Fried quail anyone?
I wonder if you ended up contacting that expert back and showing her your results
I love baby chicks
Name it qwily
OMG 😳
I just love how you make life out of supermarket quail eggs.
I've known about quail eggs for a long time due to 'a chick called albert'. Never got them before or since. I'd be interested to know if chicken eggs have the possibility in supermarkets.  I enjoy eggs, but only if unfertilised of course.  I don't have the room to own my own chickens, so rely on the supermarket. I would hope they don't let cockerels near the hens for consumer eggs.
As soon as I clicked on this video I got a add for kfc and chick fil a
So sigma my boy
Skib
Men who love animals are the sexiest

Hi I’m going to tell you how much I love this.First I love seeing if it works or not and I love your vids.then it’s so cool how you keep them safe and care for them.Next I love the cute animals and I think you should buy more but different animals but still birds.Finally I love to see animals bc I love them
Taliyah in bedwars be like:

Dont show this... Here's why            What if a supermarket's staff or manager is watching?
The next level of life
This was an amazing watch.  Also brings to light the differences in grocery practice between where you are and Canada (where I am).  In Canada, all eggs in grocery stores are not only initially kept refrigerated in the shops, but they're also candled and pasteurized in the packaging process.  It is exceedingly rare for an egg to develop after all that, and when one does manage it unfortunately it's even more rare for them to live for very long or be discovered before perishing inside the egg.  Because of the pasteurizing process the eggs go bad faster outside of refrigeration, so most people just automatically put the pack in the fridge. Very cool, I hope you don't run into any legal trouble for this experiment!
Life begets life as it should be. Every item in the store should be able to reproduce itself. If not then it isn’t food, its a mad mans  science experiment.
I’ve already did this.
this is fake
Are you going to tell us if the video gets 19300 subs?
This is fake
i cant understand what bro is saying...
What’s happening to them now?
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
It’s crazy how that actually worked, I was not expecting that to happen 😂
U live in the uk do you
Good on you saving the qauil population!
what came first the chicken or the egg
The large incubator is a VERY good one!! Congrats! You could of kept a few girl quails for eggs, just saying.
This was an amazing video u should make more like these not not specifically on hatching eggs❤️
good luck

U LITERALLY SHATTERED A SUPERMARKET SUPPLIER'S JOB BRO CONGRATS
A chick called albert already did this like 2 years ago
Ill eat your entire army! with respect <3 great video
This was my dream
OMGOSH!!!  Amazing & thank you for sharing.  When I was pregnant with my first baby (forty years ago), I was making breakfast & twin yolks came out of the shell.  Through the whole pregnancy I couldn’t even think of eating eggs.  I don’t eat them very often & now it’ll be hard to do it again.   Love your enthusiasm ❤
I hope this guy didnt fake this video.  Most stuff on the internet is fake and if he bought fertile eggs and pretended they are supermarket eggs and then someone lost a contract over it, he is in for a WORLD of hurt when that comes out.
What will you do with the chicks when they get big? And will you give us update vids on the growing chicks/chickens?
You would need to put sperm inside the egg
I am egg 🥚
*Least obviously AI geneated thumbnail:*
Breakfast: ❌  Bigger breakfast: ✅✅✅
Bc of this video i am never gonna eat eggs
I would like to point you to a channel called "A Chick Called Albert" to see a man save wildlife and hatch all kinds of birds. He also started with supermarket quail eggs.
I think they think your there mom or dad that’s why they go up to you   😬
I had 2 quail eggs hatch out of 30.
I dare you to do more just more give me more or else
Uh! Life will find a way! Jeff Fly guy.
Can you give me a chick
Incredible. Nice work. Cant believe how cute they are ❤ New sub
Eggs in my country are sold unfertilized so can’t really hatch them here. Oh, the vid covers that
😃yippe egg will hatch
Is this the same guy from TGFbro
honestly i feel so bad cuz i literally ate quail legs yesterday🫠
Lol, his excitement, priceless! 😂🎉❤
Missing yoshi Island bgm
I love this video so much thank you recommendations
This is the best video ive ever watched
I won't one please
So cute😍
Nice
You are a legend
6:55
egg
Hows life as a quail god going you maniac
Pls part 2
We also have Quails, in germany they are called „Wachteln“
same reaction from every single men in this room 6:40
I'm planning on doing this eventually. I also love how excited Jay gets, he's like a happy puppy.
Chicken food no dog food no cat food well maybe dog food if their pets can pack it
The trick with baby chicks or quails or any bird is that the only way you can take them out of the incubator is when they are all dry when they're wet they have probably just hatched from the egg can I have 55 chickens and there are wild so if you have a lot of for Birds put them in the backyard because if you had some they'll be outside for their whole entire life until we die but we have to make sure you check on the chickens or baby quails or any birds that you had out of the incubator so you can have it live for a longer time we had a duck the leg was broken and he died a few days later so I'm actually happy you can hatch eggs but make sure to take care of the babies every single day that's the best thing I've ever heard but chickens or birds don't like people unless you pet them everyday I think❤❤❤
Dont feel guilty about egg waste. Chickens and foul like this all produce eggs naturally as part of their reproductive cycles. She didn't work hard to make it, its more like it just happens that the bird makes them. "Food waste" as such is more an issue of other agricultural produce. If you waste 4 eggs or no eggs, the bird is no more or less "green". Its at most a pocket money going to waste.
JAY GO TO THE CONJURING HOUSE AND STAY A FEW NIGHTS WITH ALL THE BOYS
You earned a subscriber from Perth Australia
I could feel jays happiness through the screen 😀😀I also smiled
Your a dad now
In Europe eggs can be in pantry In Australia we can put them in Fridge and pantry. 50% of Australian put their eggs in fridge
2:07 you need chicken sperm to hatch supermarket eggs
Is no one talking about the shape of the broken egg at the start…??? Or am I the only one who noticed.. 🫣
wow that is so cool
Amazing !!
how to get chicken cheaper🍽️
I shall not let your quail army defeat me.
Unbelievable you are amazing😂😂😂
Have you tried this with chicken eggs also or just quail?
To be honest this is my first time watching your channel and this vid was amazing!
What an amazing story your a true hero they"d be dead if not for you you've gotten a sub
im never eating eggs again
I've hatched quail from the grocery store several times
This would not be possible with eggs in the US, which are always refrigerated. Also, female laying hen chicks are much more rigorously separated from male chicks, at birth, and laying hens don't even live on the same farm as the breeders, so there isn't any possibility of fertile eggs being put in a carton.
#savesainsbaysquales 😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
19,300 NOWWWWWWW
QUAILS
50 % or so of these chicks will be rooster and unfortunately, they can't live with each other, eventually they will kill each other, unless you have a really big enclosure.
Wow. Virtually half of those eggs were fertilized. Ewe. That’s terrible and should never happen.
Unbelievable congratulations🎉. technically is a 90% chance of them hatching now because it was 302 that you hatched
So what happened to the chicks????
this is so cute thank jesus couse he help u and repent before its to late when i slept i saw a dream or i dream and it was judgement day i made it to heaven me and my mom it was like i was in a room it was all white so amen to the lord jesus christ he make all things new and spread the gospels amen ✝️🙏
I want to hatch a chicken 🐔
Many years ago we kept poultry and put the eggs in the fridge. Chickens. We’d have friends who’d take eggs from us for hatching and almost every egg hatched a chick. I don’t know if it’s different for quail.
wow just wow i will never look at eggs the same way from now on lol great job
😊
Someone may have already said this, but make sure when you incubate your eggs you put the small pointy  end down in your trays. The air bubble needs to be at the top. Also make sure you turn your Turner off 2 to 3 days before hatch time and take your eggs out of the trays . place the eggs on their side for them to hatch.
I wish he didn't expose the egg providers
Cap 🧢
great
❤ I love it
Wow
lol we knew about this already, hatched about 20 of them, then proceeded to feed them all to our snakes cause they wouldn't eat the eggs, circle of life.
its like tryin to find gold in those gold digging thingys at the start
Are you dumb or what none of the eggs are fertilized and a egg has to be fertilized or it will not hatch
All eggs in American supermarkets are refrigerated. Don't think it work for anyone here...
Do you think the same would happen with chicken eggs?
Whole cooked baby quails are a delicacy, next video should be "how to prepare quail" 😂👍
Om6😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
good job
193 adorable lives were saved in this video. Great job. Those quails are sooooooooooooooooo cute!
Love to see videos of all you fools buying eggs from the store and "hatching" them...please post your "results"
Why in f*** with the supermarket be selling fertile eggs!?
I’ve done this
Hardly any effort hahaha, this dude is a youtube joke. What about the 3000 dollar egg flipper's effort. Or the hundreds of dollars in eggs, or the enclosure and the motion sensing camera that's telling you theyre hatching. And what about the 300 little lives you are now responsible for...this dude spent more money on these chicks than some of us make in a year. brooding eggs is alot of work folks. If your not a youtuber with sponsors money to burn or  you don't have a farm and a ton of spare time and building skills  It's probably best to keep to what you know
fake but cool
fake
😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭
British person with the least accent:
I want to try!!!!!
Reminds me of “A chick called Albert”  just came across this , great video ❤
The first chick i will name it Little mily
Breakfast is fighting back
This is such an amazing channel
this is fake I tried it 4 times nothing happened
I'd be curious to see the result if you compared the grocery store's cheap eggs that come from large production facilities with cages (there should be zero chance of a male chicken in these facilities) and the eggs that are free range and come from smaller farms (could have male chickens around).  I'm guessing that the cheap eggs almost never hatch.  That makes for an interesting twist in the ethics of free range chicken farming.
Time to do it with Chicken eggs. ❤
THE ARMY IS GROWING
There’s an entire channel devoted to a quail that was hatched from a supermarket egg. He rescues eggs, birds, and farm animals
This is why I don’t eat meat, milk, or eggs. Too cute
12:18 I’m subbing now
Sainsbury’s response? Hrm?
I wish you hid the brand many people could loose thire job
this is the fistc time i am waching this viteo
Wow this dude is rich
After video Bro gets hungry and looks at them 😂
You showed the power of survival !! ❤❤❤❤❤
U can save millions of birds if u tell the company
I fr thought this was fake , but it’s not
I WANNA NAME HER/HIM BROWNIE SO BADLY
this video would be so much easier to watch if you were not hollering at us through the entire video
As they say at Snake Discovery, "Incubate until there's no debate!"
You saved so many quails omg I’m crying
Hi youtube
“Your from sainsburys” 😭
Bro now it’s gonna be army for its military
OMG you Eggs No no no 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 oooooooommmmmmgggggg
Im still eating eggs, but now i have to try
Imagine beginning life on planet earth 🌎 and the first thing your hear is Jay swingler “OMG welcome to the world little guy😊 your from sainsburys 😂”
WHAT DO YA MEAN IVE BEEN EATING CHICKS ALL MY LIFE LOL
This is great but I have to wonder what you are going to do with 193 quail?
man, its just chicks in eggs, efc thered come chicks out, such a high chance of it, we dont put the eggs in the fridge to not get chicks, we put them in there to get eggs without chicks
This is why we say incubate til there’s no debate.
This is so incredible   you did the impossible
meh. "A chick called Albert" channel did this years ago.
Great video, wholesome asf!
yes I am going to let your qeale Amrmy defet me
awe, you're a momma!
Hi😊
What a magical moment that had to be.
I kind of want to be defeated by the quails 😂 is that bad?
Hi jay i am currently dieing from the cuteness from the quails
its funny how he wanted 193k subs and he Has 1,93+ m subs
Im watching and eating quail eggs
jay ur a cool dude lol
maaaaaaan i'm glad you're still around n makin content. MORE CHICKENS, LET EM LIVE@@#!!
epic
I been raising quail egg and after they're hatched I got 12 quails now 😊
You can actually put the eggs under hot sand and it will incubate I tried this and mine hached
sainsbury's if you are watching this you just saw one of your products come to life and reply here.
New sub❤🎉
Omg 😲
Totally awesome CONGRATULATIONS DUDE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😮😮😮😮
I AM BUYING AN INCUBAITOR NOW TY
I just read they are in a sanctuary. That's awesome. 😊
Fertilized eggs are supposed to be healthier. So they do sell them fertilized in organic natural food stores.
Where are the quail?
The whole video is fake, because it is not possible to hatch quail from supermarket eggs! You used fertilized eggs! You also did not state how many quails died in your large incubator, because of your mistake, because you did not stop the turning of the eggs three days before and transfer the eggs to special containers where they must rest! How many quails got stuck in your turner and died there? Maybe you can fool naive people with your video, but you can't fool me!
I found you  today and you are my favourite YouTuber
I hope you get a chick
Absolutely false video 😔 it's true a egg has to be fertilized with a roster! The eggs might be mixed with fertilized eggs? But after washed and refrigerated even a fertilized egg will NOT hatch out! Totally a lie! Raised in the country all my life around chickens.
i almost cryd wen i saw it moving
Go go
They are so adorable. Believe it or not it's been done in the u.s. with fridgerated chicken eggs successfully. But I love the quail army best!
this is a good man
We won
Can i want some PLS😢
revolution !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want to see you show the person that said you had no chance of hatching the eggs the 193 quails that you hatched
Jay Swingler:  The guy on the channel A Chick Called Albert hatched supermarket eggs.
kinda crazy how you got unfertilized eggs and hatched them
Ima stop eat eggs ngl
They gonna peck my eyes out😥😥😥
You shouldn't dyay who the store is if someone is going to lose there contract as a supplier
Nope, kinda diminishes the success at saving 2 quails by adding all the rest. Also I thought the point of this was to have one or two pets?
I have turkeys. My female started laying last month. At first, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Turkey eggs are perfectly fine to eat, but I read if I keep taking them, she'll find somewhere else to lay them. I decided to put a date on it and put it back. She laid 13 more, and now she's gone broody. I'm hoping she's successful at hatching them herself, but I'm not sure if I should move them to a brooder once she does or let her raise them because I've heard turkey moms aren't great moms, but she thinks my chickens are also her babies and gets mad at me for messing with her chicken babies.
Wonderful now you have to decide what you will do with them
Can you do that with store bought chicken eggs?
Omg!! Great job!!!
Quail roam wild where I am from, and still live. So I could easily do this. I would just have to find a nest. But I wouldn’t ever.
When I was younger 16, I hunted a lot.  I sent away for Pheasant eggs hatched them . Raised them tell they were young, released them in a field, hunted them and eaten them.
The vid was cool
The thing is chicken eggs at superstore arnt fertile they don’t have a rooster so that’s weird
This is why I eat chicken eggs from the store. They're unfertilized.
I really wanna save a chick but I think my dad won’t allow it he think I’m gonna kill it because my little age and not responsible
I saw a video where they did this similar experiment. It was at a Trader Joe’s in the U.S of A. Now I’m a vegetarian. 😅
At almost 2 million subs. I think we've chosen your new profession for you. You are now a professional chicken.
I love you
I felt very happy This video was very good. I can't wait to see the little chick. Gonna be so cute little chicken.
I seriously hope you didn’t fake this.. because that could cause a massive hit to the farm supplying the eggs. Meaning layoffs and even bankruptcy if it’s a small family operation.
bro YouTube ........ WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.          😮😲😏🤔😅😇👍👏👀🧑‍💻
i love every thing you do  😀
FYI as a farmer if you ever decide to do something similar to this again i would recommend using a heat lamp so they do not get to cold because it could lead to death if your not careful BTW no hate and wow good job have an amazing day i am truly surprised you manged to do this <3
I'm never eating eggs again 😢😢😢😢
I believe their is a channel that has hatched a supermarket quail egg before called “a chick called Albert”
300 quails
I wanna update on the quails
The big father of the quails ❤
you can start a country with this army of animals
You should make anothe video like this I love your videos
Is there an website you ordered the 300egg incubator from?
It's actually creepy how many embryos some of us probably eaten 👁️👄👁️
the quails are so cute i woud let them beat me
wow!!!!!!!!!! so good nice job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stop swearing
That’s impossible.  Pre fertilized 🥚 aren’t found in the store.  Roosters 🐔 of any sort aren’t allowed in the hen house for any factory.  It’s to keep sellable eggs just that…sellable.  Otherwise they are unsanitary.  To get eggs to do that the Store bought ones would have to be switched out for either wild eggs or eggs intended for hatching purposes.
Come on bro not the AI thumbnail😰😔
Well I hope you hatch more
Great video I love it.👍👍
Bro, I felt like you just released Jurassic Park
Is no one going to acknowledge that the thumbnail is clearly ai generated.  Still a Really good video.
ngl, nice my man
I worked at chicken egg farn there is no males no fertile eggs . Maybe one outta million.  If a morf male ends up caged with a hen.
OMG the first one is not killed ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😮😮😮😮😮🎉
i love your vids
Thank for not going on a vegan rant
Part 2 please I want to see them grow
Wonderful content
But what about chicken eggs?
Quail Daddy!
ok i was wrong
2nd real or what
fake he didn't even show him hatching and the chicken needs to learn how to walk they are still weak
with out any effort he said the money you used to buy those equipments are from effort
Wow that's so cool man😅😅
Have you checked out the channel A Chick Called Albert ? He started same as you hatching a supermarket egg, and now rescues all kinds of animals.
welcome to the world little buddy's
Adorable, but also not sure what you will do with all the leftover eggs you cannot eat. Maybe feed it to the chicks.
Stop eating animal....see how it hard to make a life
What a beautiful video jay!, im glad that you saved quails from being boiled :D
I am never eating quails again!
fortunately in my area most off egg is unfertilized
1. The price of fertile egg is higher. 2. They sorts fertile egg and those eggs that couldn't make it through they definitely sells those eggs. 3. So, Technically you could hatch.
That's sooo cool  !
Cute!
Absolutely Awesome    They are so adorable.  And so happy!
ill try this hehe
Holy moly
The fact it was more than half the success rate is crazy!
No veins  No life
😊❤❤❤❤
Only 193?
Can you do that with the Big egg
I worked in a lab where we had to incubate embryos to full development
❤❤❤
You made My Day Big ups 🥺❤️ God Bless you More..
Hello Jay , I'm an American and after watching the entire video I was shocked and now I just might go to the supermarket and buy a dozen or two of eggs to see if I can get them eggs to hatch !!! Thank you for sharing this information it was epic to watch🇺🇸💯❤️😇🙏🏻✌🏻💪🏻😎🙌🏻👋🏻👍🏻😱🔥🤣
see, I feel sad about eating fertilized eggs a little bit ngl. But in the US they'd be refrigerated from the start so i think they would be harder to hatch if at all. Luckily i have quail hens and no roo so i actually know they won't be fertilized xD
Not the AI thumbnail 😭😭
Congratulations! They are so cute!❤
We all know these are fake.
There must have been a rooster somewhere.  😂
You should try this with chickens!!!
Imagine being a quail, just born, and the first thing you hear out of the egg is a man shouting  “two focking sainsbury’s eggs”
The amount of effort he puts into his videos are insane KEEP UP THE FREAT WORK JAY!!!!!!!
so buy more and send to the pet store
I don't know if it's been said here. But to the people worried about eating eggs that may be able to produce a live chick, just dont eat range eggs or most so called organic eggs.or quail eggs. Most of your supermarket eggs are from factories where there are no Roosters, wich is required to fertilize each egg.So no worries.  If you crack a fresh egg and there is a tiny red speck inside, that is the Roosters part,it has been fertilized. But it's no big deal, you can still eat it. I have my own chickens with Roosters present, and eat plenty of them. The main thing is to always put all your eggs into a small  container of water if they sink like a rock they are fresh and good to eat. If they float they are bad. If maybe they tip upright but not float they are still good but not very fresh. No worries people.  And oh yes hatching out chicks is an amazing thing to experience. The gift of life in all things is wonderful.
Can I play warzone with you
👏👏👏 you r a dad
Somehow this video shows how wonderful and productive life can be. Great video.
Candling only works after the eggs are warm and starting to develop.
HEY IM WAITING YOU REACHED  1.94M SUBS
I love your little guys
bro chicken eggs dont hatch without a rooster yet they ca still be layed with a hen
More 🙂
194 000 000 Quails
could i do this
Awe, looks like you got one or two white quails as well :3
ITS THE RISE OF THE QUAILS!
I liked it when you said you weren't going to go off on some vegan rant, that it was not what you were here for.  However I think you did send a very strong message, showing that so many of the eggs that should NOT be fertilized are making it to grocery store shelves.   Perhaps the big corporations should be held accountable for this.
That's great man good job
IM SO HAPPY THAT OBE EGG HAS LIFE 🥹
Get a few osteridge eggs on the go next 💯🤣🤣🤣🤣
A chick named Albert youtuber did this twice. He hatched his first which he named Albert 7 years ago. Than recently he hatched another.
what are you feeding them?
supermarket eggs are not fertilized.
My dad is doing that.He is making a mum but we have chickens so we don't do them from the stove
The quails army . 😮
this video was epic and really interesting and fun
The channel A chick called Albert did this 7 years ago and he's not only  saving chicken eggs but many more you could learn alot from him
What are the products  you used form Amazon called
Quail eggs are generally fertilised...hen eggs not. There is no issue with eating fertilised eggs...we do every day - you might see the occasional inclusion in eggs, but unless you incubate them at 37.7 degrees you won't get a chick! Cheers from rural Portugal @HowardsPortugal
Challenge for you : Get 4 5 chickens and leave them in the forest and then come back in 3 months and see what happens.
This is so cool! But don't try to do chicken eggs or any eggs that come in the fridge. Once a fertile egg has been refrigerated, there is no chance of it developing if you incubate it.
A chick called Albert channel did this
This feels like a pro-life ad 😂 I'm kinda all for it tbh
dis is fun😀
You guys buy your eggs right off a regular shelf. In the US eggs are washed of the protective coating and then sold to us in the Refrigerated area. 😟 ^Edit- IM SO PROUD OF YOU!! ❤❤❤❤😢😂❤ Congrats on being a new Dad!🎉🎉🎉
You actually done it my heart beating out of my chest I've got quails of my own you should go to other supermarkets and see if any other eggs I've got cheeks😮🤯
You’re a natural bird dad.
Nice chicken nuggets
I’m gonna try too very nice video
9,300sub now
8;400sub
I've never seen quail eggs in a grocery store.
What a coincidence, today I was in the taxi with your dad and i found out that your music teacher now works at my scjool
''How did you get quails?'' supermaket eggs
The way he says "SaInSbUrY'S eGgS" is so heart warming.
I love chicken ❤❤😂😂
THIS IS SO COOL!
First of all the fact that you hatched all these quails just for your clickbait so you could get a ton of views is b******* you knew you weren't going to keep those quails what if you wouldn't have been able to find a place to take them and I find it hard to believe that the place was just willing to take almost 200 quails most cities sanctuaries are completely full because of people like you I think it's cool to get chicks or ducks or watch them hatch you know you're not going to take care of them or end up finding out it's not that fun and easy also to all the fools on here that think this is an organic video this dude has almost 2 million subscribers this is controlled content a government slaki and really he's going to do something that can get the grocery store in trouble and the supplier of the eggs bull crap if a real person was organically doing this they would be shut down their video would not be shown this was all set up fake scripted for dummies like and subscribers thinking this is so cool you want to see something real cool why don't you watch real farm homesteads that actually really do the work and care about animals and take care of them and they aren't some fake shill on YouTube
good job
Omg I LOVE YOU! 😂 Your enthusiasm, your passion, your love for life, your Brummie accent (I used to live there)! And I’ll never eat eggs again. Crazy world we live in
Way Jay!  I'm still at, I want a cage free egg as my boundary. I know many who insist on quail eggs; which I have never eaten, yet. I think of it the same as a neighbor who asserted " you can't say that" to me, after I said I will never be homeless. Of course, I can say that. I'm 64 years old, never married, have always taken care of myself. I also said, it's not up to them to be like me; and damn sure not up to me to be them. To honor diversity it to honor it. And not to make all kinds of political restraints to force uniform conformity. Without deviation no progress can exist. I can say that too. Without individualism, like yours, so much knowledge, real truth, is simply lost. The more you know; the more we know.  And ignorance is still a choice.
I heard that quails are always held in mixed pens because they need to live in groups and it's near-impossible to differenciate between the hens and roosters. So there are always some fertilized eggs in the stashes, hence why there is a roughly 10% chance of hatching such an egg.
Congratulations man! You made a cheap egg into a 40 quid pet like DANG well..... 40×302 so 1280 or something so THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE YOUR MONEY WORTH B)
man i love chickens
So much fun!,,
You didn't put the bigger incubator in your info it just has the small one!
finally a entertaining youtube video!
Grocery store in America keep the eggs in cold storage so yeah thats not gonna happen here .
This is really nothing new. People hatch eggs from the market quite often.
This isn’t it tbh. I really thought you were doing something that actually did have meaning. But this does not. It proves that you are eating something with potential for a beautiful life. Something that has already evolved for years to be able to reproduce and create this life naturally. It is not beautiful to hatch super market eggs and say you are creating a life. You are not. People need to learn we can survive without taking from sentient life, and we can let these beautiful creatures thrive in their natural habitats under natural circumstance. I’m proud of you for surrendering them to sanctuary but it was unnecessary and leaves less room for actual rescued animals that need that shelter. The sooner we stop exploiting animals the sooner we can appreciate how beautiful animals are and the best thing we can do for them is liberate them and stop a centuries long holocaust. Every being deserves their life. You are an empathetic man evidently and I hope you open your eyes to the bigger picture one day and fight on the right side of history along with so many millions of others Who are making the same realisation every day. All Love 💚🌱
Yum, cholesterol and heart disease.   That's one way to off yourself.
2:36 😂😂
HOW are you Hatching an UNFERTILIZED 🥚 EGG ?
Personally I think these kind of videos are interesting
subbed!
I was wondering what the first Amazon incubator the small one is called?
Subscribed 👍
😂😂waw👏👏👏👏👍
How come the eggs aren't in the refrigerator? All eggs are kept in the fridge in the supermarket in Canada.
Bro it is getting so intence
Just subscribed!!
This is genius
Watta crackegg
Literally thought about how many chicks I’ve eaten.. 🥲
Them bitches never go to waste in my house there can never be enough
the army of 300....quails!
What about free range eggs
Wouldn't surprise me if all eggs are actually like this . Just grabbed and sold
Ok……….. that definitely deserves a sub
That’s awesome!!
Not sure about my intended breakfast now. Takes me back to Convent boarding school. Fairly often a boiled egg would reveal an embryo. The nuns always told us to eat them and stop being ridiculous. Lots of rebellious and nauseated young ladies. No way could we even attempt to eat them...cue shouting from nuns about starving children in..?? I'm afraid we used to say 'send the eggs to them then'. That was then, but l still cannot stomach the idea of eating one. Thanks for your film. Did Sainsburys have a hissy fit? And Clarence Court? Interesting to know.
such a good dad. If i sub, name one after me plz. lol.
Keep updating us , am from Kenya, farming animal is my dream, i hope GOOD GOD CONES THROUGH FOR me, am kinda in a mess situation, watching your video was soo lovely, i hope they grow man
Omg! Awesome
As I kid when I learned what eggs were, I kept some in my room to "save" them. Obviously they just rotted and made the room smell awful, but this is living the dream my child self had. Amazing!
I love this Jay tysm u did so well so many things happen but this was amazing among all the stuff happening this was nice I love it
Your not supposed to open an incubator with chick. you have to wait 1/2 days after they hatched before opening and putting them into a small penn. Or else they could dry out and die
Omg 😮 I don't think I can eat eggs either ..babies ❤
I want to do it too but with chickens
This is so beautiful
How do we know this is real?
Please, Jay Swingler come back to the ring 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thay shall rize
Yesss bro you did it
In America there aren't any  roosters in with the hens so zero chance of fertile eggs 😮
You are so adorable! The way you get so excited over realizing that you’ve got actual living babies is so heart warming. And you’re funny! You’re quail army to defeat those people who don’t subscribe is a riot! Finally, I’m stuck in bed sick. It’s been days. Im exhausted and bored to death. This video was so funny and wholesome and it gave me such a smile. Thank you 😊
👍🇨🇦
Not sure why this would cause a problem for the supermarket or the supplier. If anything it proves that the eggs are healthy, pure and the hens are raised free range. No chance of doing this with battery hens eggs.
Bravo👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is my first time watching your video's.  Who could stop?   I love how excited you get when these eggs start moving.  Your Awesome
Did you name each one of them? Dude these quails are your children now!😂 I wish I can do it here but dang, I can’t find eggs that are not refrigerated where I live.
Quail Daddy!  ❤
6:30 Congratulations, you’re going to be a father! He’s so happy 😂.
Quail eggs at stores have been hatched so many times.  The first one I’ve heard of is Albert. A chick called Albert.  This guy hatches all types of eggs.
Their eggs are on the shelf in the UK vs the US. Interesting
Congratulations  papa!
You're  acting  like me when I first began. I loved it! I was excited, loved being a chicken Mom!
They screen eggs to make sure they're not fertile before they go to a supermarket!
Nice
My sons’ girlfriend hatched quail m by
Wow you are building an army of quails
I’ve raised quails.. (for fun..not to eat) mom hides them in her feathers.. really cute..
Wow this is amazing
Amazing Frightening And amazing❤
Life always finds a way 😅
This video makes me feel many different things. I feel scared to eat eggs any time again. I also feel so entertained by a big bearded man babytalking to chicks 🐣❤️❤️.  Honestly so much love!! You literally saved their lives! Might be one of the best videos I ever watched. ❤
Wait 193 out of 300 eggs? That mean more than 50%? Incubate the egg for say 12 days? Can replicate that fully grown embryo egg? Really want to taste that thing
What fun you had🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
omg, i love the fact theres just a blonde one is so cute
i am vegan who formerly ate eggs  "oh, well yeah, you ate eggs before you became vegan?"  no, i ate eggs before i saw this video
Who wants part 2
Oo
they are nice with some fries or in a sandwich
I don't understand.....did you buy all those quail eggs from the grocery store and every single one of them had chicks in them?  If not and you bought them so you could hatch them, why?  You have no experience with quails do you?  To hatch 300 eggs and then hand them over to someone else seems very irresponsible to me.  It seems hatching the first two made you point.
You're not guilty of wasting an egg, the UK government is guilty of forcing farmers to stop producing food altogether. Do you know what happens when a metropolis population go without food??
Really fun video but what did you do with all the babies?
I’ve done this before with Publix quail eggs and I actually got a beautiful falb fee female. We got the eggs at Publix and named her Georgia after the founder of Publix, George.
what are the chances the last egg has life i dont belive you and rember no chans
So cute ❤🎉
Simply don't get free-range eggs if this bothers you so much.
So cool, You should have kept 10 or 12 to keep laying eggs for the table and used their droppings to grow a garden.  They are much quieter than chickens.
The real question is...What are you going to do with all of them xD
Awh I love happy endings, daddy!  Congratulations ❣️ Now, you are going to name them all, right?!  🥰
Dude you only have to to look for a like blood clot that means that the egg is fertile, it's the way we check the chicken eggs.
This was amazing to watch.  I am not sure how I feel about eating eggs now, I only use them in baking Problem is when we look into most of our food we will find issues with it:  life from the eggs we eat, poison on our grain and vegetables, water and river contamination from run off, mistreatment of animals, levelling of forests, the list goes on.  Problem is there are just too many of us.  We can mitigate our damage though and it is important to try, I think.  We can find out the worst damage done and avoid those foods or use substitutes.
You are so Awesome!!! 2 months ago I went thru a dozen eggs and 8 of them were fertile! 8 of them could have been chicks! The box did not say they were fertile! That's when I quit eating eggs altogether... It's like eating a Baby..... Love and Light to you brother! Ps.. I was in Arizona at the time. Regular grocery store eggs.
❤We humans, are  evolving to N0T consume animals. This IS 0UR next evolutionary step.❤
I was eating egs wen i starded watching video😅😅
Congratulations ❤❤
❤🎉 Awesome
I decided not to eat eggs this morning!  The only time I eat a quail egg is in my ramen bowl at a restaurant.  I’m so glad you were able to find them a safe place to live.
How do we know you haven't slipped in a few fertilised eggs in the batch?
I will NEVER let my 5 yr old son watch this video!!!!!!!! :D
Never seen quail eggs in a store before. Different Country I guess. Beautiful story.
Why does the thumbnail show chicken eggs and chicks?
Do you also have a link for the egg candler?
I never ever NEVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR waste eggs. Eggs are love, reason to live.
*55%* of the quails hatched?! 🐣  That’s crazy.
This is amazing. I'm gonna start doing this too. But I need to buy an incubator. Please help me. 😢
I went to make eggs once and when I cracked the egg, a tiny dead chick came out. I was turned off by eggs for years. I was always scared it would happen again.
Bro this is quality content
Please don't take this the wrong way, as I mean no disrespect ... but I really hope that there was no 'cheating' that went on in this video (for views,) because if this video IS true, then someone IS going to lose their contract with Sainsburys, and... potentially their livelihood, home, and everything, and, if they are guilty, then so-be-it, but if they were actually innocent ... ?
‏سارقه من أبو الرب
How do you hatch a egg from a hen that has never seen a rooster in her life? Maybe YOUR egg producers are radically different then ours, eggs are blanks, just a ball of protein,  not a pre- chicken.  You keep them chilled so they don't  ROT.  OMG!  This is ridiculous!!! I can't  finish this video😊
if they hatch he cheated eggs in shops are infertile so he must have got them from a farmer if they hatch
That was incredibly touching and motivating! Congratulations papa🥰
Congratulations daddy!
I stoped eating eggs after this
POV: Me buying all the quails in the supermarket to hatch one
Eggs from stores are not fertilized. What a friggin joke
It's false that only females are caged together. Last month I was making breakfast burritos. I cracked the eggs I bought from Walmart in Ohio and for the first time in my life, I saw a partially formed chick plop into the egg bowl. I had to throw out 6 eggs because the dead one was the last I cracked. I about puked because of how disgusting it looked.
YESSS JAYYY
Man I still love your vids so much and I’ve been watching you for yearssss
I hatched 24 quail altogether from eggs I bought out of the fridge from an Asian Supermarket. It depends on the company. Some are careful to cull the makes out of the flock. Some aren’t.
bro is causing the egg shortage💀💀
My man created a life!
That wouldn't happen if he were to hatch chicken eggs from a supermarket.  It is much less likely that they would be fertilized.
are your eggs normal? because i have in Finland white eggs
Not really suprising from a supermarket ! Mad video ❤
I know how exciting and stressful this can be.
The way you opened the door and they stated to run woooow i'm amazed 😂❤❤
Your joy totally made my day!! Soo amazing!!!! <3 <3 <3
Sooo... I'm gonna eat my breakfast now eggs........
Tell the supermarket🎉
That army hatch is like making popcorn on the hob
Can't wait for you to say to the quails that their adopted
The real question is what does one do with over 100 chicks
do it with normal eggs
So what happens next Sainsbury’s?  (Subscribed xx)
YouTuber, A Chick Called Albert has done this process several times successfully.
I love how hes super obvious that hes England
I don’t think this is real because the eggs would’ve been in the fridge
@Jay Swingler. OH... COME ON!! But I REALLY REALLY wanted to see the look on the ladies face when you face timed her back and showed her the results of your experiment! Darn it anyway!!! LMAO!! but I truly did. And I was waiting for it at the end
Now ill be sad when I eat an egg.
Two notes for someone that raises quail. To improve your hatch rate, turn off the turner at 14 days, the chicks need a few days to move into hatching position and they can become confused and not move into hatching position if the turner is left on after day 14. Also they can hatch as late at day 23 so you should have left the incubator on lock down until you were sure no more eggs would hatch - especially with a small home incubator that likely had hot and cold spots. Also leave the chicks in the incubator for their first day, their chirping encourages the other eggs to hatch and gives the babies a chance to dry off - you moved the two babies to the brooder a bit too early, thankfully they seemed to pull through, but they can get too cold a die doing that, but I bet more eggs would have hatched if you had let the incubator run longer.
Too bad people don’t get this excited about human life. I felt overjoyed seeing my daughter’s heartbeat at 5 weeks after conception, life is incredible.
Just curious how much this project cost you. Loved the journey, thank you!
You wouldn’t see an embryo before incubation. If it’s there, it would only be a few hundred cells big, if that. It takes a few days of constant temps to see embryos.
I am entertained!
😍😍😍
I enjoyed the video, I subscribed goodnight mate!
I hunt quail and pheasant
I haven’t watched the whole video, but I hope he hatches one
w video and hes saving lives
Do cavier next
Jay, can I have one plz bro?
This video is amazing I loved it keep going!!!!
Still can’t believe someone would have eaten that
o my god!!!!!! No way!!!!!
fertilized eggs are more nutritious  than unfertilized. I don't see the issue with eating them. whats the difference than eating a chicken?
Life is amazing. In an egg,  womb, or room 🎉❤
wow you can make some friend chicken and eggs with those
The army has risen...
Even youtube self checks your videos
Quality YouTube
This is why we don't play god children.
Imagine when his girlfriend/wife has their baby how excited would he be
Jay are you moving bro
In USA I don’t think this would happen. The farms that raise chickens have long huge chicken houses with all female chicks. We don’t have quail eggs. All eggs are refrigerated at the store.
Ok, so you change them from breakfast to dinner, what's new?
Will never eat eggs again after watching this video.
Oh my gosh what are you gonna do with them all!!!
Aaaahh thts great xx ❣️
I am curious what the lady said in response to you hatching that many quail? Makes you wonder what all egg are out there that can be hatched as well? Goose eggs, pea fowl...emu
This is amazing!!! Just found your video - I want to try this now! Hahaha. Thanks for sharing!!
I love everything about this video I love the content.I love your personality and you are quite handsome with a strong dash of man pretty😊
Ur accent is so annoying
Congratulations 😢👨👉🐣🐤🐥:'(
That's sad....We're being sold fertilized eggs on who knows how many occasions. That's horrifying they are intentionally murdering unborn chickens instead of us eating unfertilized eggs. This is sickening....I'm happy you saved a few little lives ..
I want a chicken
So cute!
Ok so in school we had some chicks and everyone was so excited to see them we made a little house for it and when we came back to school the next day it was you know dead we were all super sad so after school I snuck into the kitchen and took an egg out of the drive and put it under my blanket because I thought it would have turns out in the middle of the night I rolled over in my bed and squished the egg the egg went all over even into the brand new carpet and my hair so in the morning I crawled out of my bed and had to hesitantly tell my mum and dad what had happened which was so not cool and  turns out when my mum cleans my bedsheets she realised that the egg had completely ruined my favourite fluffy sheet the moral of the story is don't do stupid things  hope u like my story
This isn’t the first time that live chicks have been hatched from supermarket eggs. So much fun, except for the waiting.
I guess, now your gonna eat chicken nuggets instead of an egg for breakfast
Egg sales will go up now everyone is gonna be hatching them
Lol hope you didn't have an over crowding issues, or drowned quails. These guys are incredibly dumb and are prone to canabilsm.
Go vegan for environment,climate,creatures to save the world
You should name the babies after subscribers!
I have never seen you or your videos before but I absolutely subscribed. This is the content I’m here for.
Seeing this as my first video from you channel made me so happy, I just really like it
Like your videos,  @2:44 what is the brand of the sweater?
It is so weird that here in the USA all the stores refrigerate eggs.
mate i was filling up when the first 2 hatched !!!! ... love it :D
2:18 😂 the look on his face....he is so excited to ruffle some feathers 😂
As someone who’s done this for over 10 years, there’s no way there would be an embryo at day 1 🤣🤣🤣 the embryo is literally invisible to the eye until day 5 at least. Candling the eggs at day 1 is absolutely pointless. I’d put all of them in the incubator & candle at day 5.
🎉 awesome 👏🏻 I subscribe and like 👍 a lot this video!!
Waitrose quail eggs & duck eggs are often the most fertile.. I do not recommend anyone doing this unless you have plans for the chicks that come from them.
Awwww ❤
Here in Canada, eggs are in the cooler. So any chance of getting a fertilized one wouldn't matter.
7:22 ✅
You got my subscription with your squeals of joy!
Have you had any children. I hope when you do. That u video when u get to see your baby be born. Or hear the heartbeat.
you’re now a mom jay ❤😂
I came upon this video in my feed and am now one of your subscribers. I never imagined that we could hatch chicks from the eggs sold in a supermarket.
I wanna TRY IT i always dreamed of having Small Chicks 😭
Much love , subscribed today 💫
and like
I'm going to sub to u
EVEN YOUTUBE COMMENTED!?!?!??!?
Wow I always wondered if this was possible💜
0:31 make a video on saving plates
As a country girl I didn't really enjoy this video farm life is meant to be f***ed that how nauture works
I just wanted to say thank you for giving these babies a second chance. I personally have been through alot in my life. I got in to some really bad places and very dark times. Animals have literally saved my life more times then i can count. As humans there are so many times we need second chances so why cant we give them to animals as well. We have gotten so far removed from the way humanity once was. Its upsetting to see the things we take advantage of or take for granted. Large industries have put money so far above life its disgusting. Its amazing how our morals have just seemed to completely disappear. Anyways, life is so precious, thank you
I tried this and it didn't work. It's weird how every YouTube who tried this is successful
thumbs down. you have been defeated. nice try?
I didn't understand: the farmers must send "dead" eggs, without embryos, to the supermarkets?? Or I took this wrong? (English isn't my first language)
When I was young (many years ago), my dad kept hens. We ate the majority of the eggs they laid, but if there was a clocking hen dad put about 10 eggs under her which she sat on till they hatched. Obviously we had a few roosters too so the eggs were sometimes (but not always) fertile. If we had not eaten the eggs though, they would've been wasted as hens dont clock every time they lay an egg, so dont feel too bad for eating eggs. New subscriber here from Northern Ireland, loved this video.
That is awesome!
Ate an egg while watching this! We have our own chickens we raise with no roosters since they are annoying little twats so ethically speaking my eggs are guilt free. (I eat plenty of animals taken before their time as well only my eggs are guilt free the rest I just can't be bothered to care about it's food.)
Omg
bro please duck one duck is very cute
Dude, I hatched Canadian geese, abandoned wild eggs! We had to find them a home after a few months and they ran after the truck when we drove away! They  thought I was their mom.
the happiness..., you know...
Bro I almost ended the video early then got to 3:55 😮
I've always been told that supermarkets only get unfertilzed eggs
They eat corn. Corn and chick and eggs lowers my blood sugar. So, I should just eat the Corn of the three.
Great going, Trump.
I ate eggs while I watched this 😂 I feel guilt
Him getting excited over this is adorable
you are so real for this
i want to eat the biggest quail
Amazing!!
You think this is cool. I had chinese painted quail. The hen kept laying eggs every day, but never sat on them. So I took three and put them in my sports bra. I ended up with one chick and called her Cassy. So you can do it without an incubator too lol
Also I tried this with a normal egg and I but it under a heat lamp and I saw something in it so my parents threw it away
Amazing, next you😊 need to take frozen fish from Birdseye and warm them in warm water see them come to life  🤔😊My great grandparents started Sainsbury's, I think they would be horrified😂😂
I saw something in the second egg WHY
Better video for making you consider veganism than anything the vegans have been putting out
Wait, what are you going to do with all those quail?!
You are a Sigma
this was amazing! do you think I can do this with any kind of egg? I'm willing to try!
what an idiot he made an egg as a precfast just to vomet it
This video has 69000 likes
I am hungry  for kfc  now
I bought Sainsbury's quail eggs , rotate them sometimes in incubator, and I had 8 from 12 hatched. There's no rocket science in hatching eggs and keeping quails . Cages are more complicated
good Job
You couldn't be more excited if you were a new dad to a human baby. Well done. 😊
say bye to that company lol
Wow....but they do sell eggs that can be incubated right?
What you gonna do with all those quails
and u now have 1.93 million sub what a coincidence🤣
It won’t incubate in your cabinet.  Silly. It needs specific heat, humidity, and rotation.
13:00 Jurrasic park be like
feel bad for the supplier
Can I have a chick?
I don’t think im gonna eat eggs ever again
I am really glad you could do that 😮🎉
Bless You and THNAKYOU🙌 susbcribed
Awesome video it is very heart warming
Imagine a staff of the super market sees this video 💀
Imagine hatching as a quail just to be part of an army while a smart monke is watching you
Great video it’s so cool that you grow a bird from a supermarket egg. Your so close to 2m
WOW THIS WAS FANTASTIC, THANKS OR SHARING. THIS IS ALSO AMAZING.HAVE YOU EVER TRIED CHICKEN  EGGS?
I love this video! Was wondering about this.
I’m in the United States and I’ve heard of people doing this, but our eggs are refrigerated in shipping and in the stores so I doubt we’d have any success here.
Wow! You are just like the kid I used to be many, many years ago! Only you actually did what I merely thought about doing. Thanks for the fun!
Beautiful.. I’ve never seen that much joy in my heart .
Im not a regular watcher of his videos. Is this for real or did he just get fertilized eggs and say they were from a grocery store?
Watching this myself I can feel the trill and wanna be part of this kind of experience.
Eggs will only hatch if the flock has roosters in it. If birds are in cages, not a hope
The turner should be taken out at lockdown. It will squish babies. I've had multiple hatches with coturnix. Never with grocery store eggs, but I want to try it lol
I was with the understanding that store bought eggs wouldn’t hatch.
Extremely rare to even get fertilised eggs in the supermarket.
You have thoroughly ruined eating eggs for me.
Coming from a small scale quail Breeder I know that quail eggs are more likely to hatch than standard chicken eggs because they are farmed on a smaller scale and aren’t bleached or treated with anything to keep them from surviving. I would be really curious if you were able to do this same thing with standard grocery store chicken eggs.
haha great video... I think I just became a vegan....
Hello. As a certified quail dad, congratulations
Idk if i can even eat an egg again with out "what if this was a fertilized egg" 😂😢
All depends where they get them local store eggs are likely large companies not likely. But... if they reproduce their own chickens they could put those left over eggs in the forsale eggs the ones they use for eggs they don't have males. Also cold eggs have low chance as well odds are bad 😅
Put sperm in it 😂😂😂
Omg this is insane I was like 🤩🤯
Cute ❤❤❤
13:15 THE ARMY SHALL RISE  JAY IS THE FATHER OF YOUTUBE
That’s 2 in three eggs. If all your eggs were fertile, it’s what you would expect.
You could've kept one they shouldn't go further then what they call home but thats just me
Loving your Betfair Casino Ad mate! Your smashing it 😂.
you have gained my respect \
What happened to Romell and tgf 😢
I want 2
No way!!!!
OMG YOUR CRAZY BRODA
I just LOVE your enthusiasm. It’s so contagious!  Well done
innit
I am now put off eating eggs 😭
What an amazing video and your big dedication! 🤍 I did cry thinking how sad and cruel the egg industry is…
Ok you got me go quails
"That Quail, Robert" is an old book that you might enjoy. It is the story of an old man finding an unhatched quail egg that the mama and babies left behind.  Good job of hatching the quails!
This fascinated me!
Here, in the USA, the stores sell eggs from chickens farms that don't allow roosters. But I think the quail eggs are not protected so there might be male quails around when those are made.
Congratulations you have 1.5 million people
Joy you hope for 19300 subscribers but here you are on 10th of march 2024, you have exactly 10,000X your initial goal which is about 1,930,000 subscribers. Congratulations have a great YouTube journey you will have enjoy it😊😊❤❤
i love THIS
Here in the states all eggs are refrigerated in the stores. All are washed and refrigerated as soon after being laid while still on the farms. We have zero chance of this happening here.
Me: I'm watching youtube. Jay Swingler: "Youtube is watching me 👀"
He was so happy :)
My one-time-only quail hunt got me 12 quail to eat. After cleaning, defeathering, gutting,  preparing, cooking, and eating, I only ended up with 12 tiny pieces of meat. Too much work for too little reward. I will stick with cattle, buffalo, deer, etc.
bros not playing pet sim with this egg hatching
Went from eggs to nuggets
Nice clickbait  , u dont deserve to be in youtube
Had a rough day but this really made me smile. Thank you
Now it's more tasty
When you watch this video and you consider the vegetarian lifestyle because of it 🤔🤯 I'm 27 and I too thought all the YouTube videos were faked until I saw this... I now feel semi guilty for all the eggs I've eaten. But what the scientist said makes sense now, the amount of times I've cracked an egg to use it and a teeny tiny embryo has come out as well!! Mass production for supermarkets is ridiculous 🤯🤯
Can we pls have a quail update :)
Next time turn the turner off or remove the turner on day 17.
Bro sounded like Goofy at 6:28
As a crazy chicken lady, I raise chickens & they have names lol. I Incubate eggs, sell the chicks & eggs for eating.But I also eat eggs ALOT!  I've been wanting to try this with regular white eggs from walmart etc. I have noticed when  cracking them, there's a dot on some that shows its been fertilized, So I am going to try that this summer!
that's content
Now feed them chicken and cocaïne so you can have an army of monsters 🙂
I wish i had a house like yours!
YOU'RE A BIRD DAD!!!
I miss your videos
Please keep him asa pet ;0
i ate eggs as i watched thes video
jake paul?
Quail are a lot easier to hatch than chickens!  For future, turn the egg turner off on day 15.
While watching this video, I couldn't seem to stop smiling. 6:34 This scene was so beautiful. 8:24 This might be the cutest thing I have ever seen. I love your videos so much, your so funny and you have this energy that is just so fun to watch, Ty for being one of the few youtubers that makes actual good content. Keep up the great work❤
Oh they look delicious. Someone grab the hot sauce.
This video is for all Vegetarians who says eggs are okay to eat
I would love to do this and would be a welcoming addition to our family! What incubator did you use?
🙋🏽‍♀️I subscribed, but I want to JOIN the quail army!!! ❤❤❤
I think you should keep going maybe try chicken eggs and see what the results with 300 would be. very intresting maybe it'd be even more 🤣
Bro invested in 350 eggs hatched 193 chickens …. Bro bought a 12 eggs for say $10 now bro can sell every chicken for $25 each.   Bros the real bull here 😂
looks like bro got 1.93 M subs
Sup
See people judge me for not eating eggs. But now I have a good reason not to eat eggs.😊 they’re so cute congratulations🎉
Bring back tgf
seeing this grown man squeal over finding a moving embryo in the eggs-totally deserves a subscribe . not to mention i think i could listen to him talk all day long
I don’t think I am going to eat eggs again thank you for posting this video
my dad breed quails in the bottom of his avery i built for him loverly little things
I cannot wait for Zoey's reaction to you being a father of 193. You legend
What did you do with the babies??
Go on jay that's mint!!!
You never said what you're going to do with all those quails now that they're hatched. Nor did you bother to tell anybody how you going to take care of those birds.
It's a very good thing that you put them together because with chicks that is with chickens babies they will die if they are left alone this according to a friend of mine who had chicks and chickens that she grew herself you cannot leave them alone they cannot be left alone they they die. I don't know if this is relevant to quails.
I wish that I could do what you're doing because I'm pretty sure the quail eggs that we have here might have hatched at least one or two if we hadn't put them in the fridge.
Wow I can’t believe this
I love watching this man
You should have another chat with the quail expert
City kids , what can I say. You know there is an entire world out there. Go visit a farmer some time.
HERO😊❤❤❤
How do you feed them?😊
Your cool 😎 ♥️
Yes
😢 the EGG industry kills millions of babies Chick's.
I like sainsburys , wherever sells eggs could be a baby bird.
Baby killers😢😢😢. Well done, mate.
Wow awesome 👍
if someone gave me a dozen eggs, i would put them in a glass cup not even mix it and chug it in 10 seconds and enjoy it.
Name one Elissa 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤
I love what you’re doing it’s a really good video and you’re not gonna eat any eggs after that
This ObiWan is our only hope
Hi that's brilliant the process and hatching is so very exciting and when you see the heart beat you just want too jump up and down your so happy the enjoyment is amazing and then the hatch is so beautiful, I know what you mean by the joy enjoy
Can you ducks next please
Instead of 19.3k subs he now how has 1.93m subs 😂
I do hope the supplier doesn’t lose their contract and have to lay off staff for the sake of you getting YouTube like!
The crappy thing is knowing now that that supermarket chain is selling fertilized eggs. That's not right. You don't need a Rooster to have edible eggs.
I subed because of those video ❤ amazing. You seem like an amazing person. I hope to see more awesome videos like this in the future
When is TGF coming back smfh
Watching life come into this world is always beautiful
I love this guy…..I keep chickens in mountains of North Carolina …,I love chickens.
Great video. I didn't know that supermarket eggs were fertile and could be incubated like that. Awesome job!
Dude, you need to report this to animal welfare.
Egg industry corrupt? Shocking. I'm in the US where Tyson plans on feeding us bugs, so, problem solved I guess. 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️
This was so cool, I've watched other creators hatch supermarket eggs before but never was sure if they were buying normal eggs or not. I wanted to let you know this kind of content is very informative, especially since it's going over things people don't tend to try themselves. So keep doing what your doing its fun to watch!!
I'm glad you hatched these eggs but I don't want you to bring trouble on the farmer
That’s awesome ❤
Im hoping none of my eggs are fertile..yikes
I got a real kick out of your video! I have hens and a roo but I make sure that the eggs aren’t set on by a hen for even a day. If they set, the eggs develop into a chick and I just go ahead and let the hen set and hatch babies.
Im gonna try this with a cadbury cream egg
11:28 highlight
That was soooo cool.  😎 what are you going to do with them now
You can hatch refrigerated eggs btw❤
Many quail laying operations have roosters in with the hens.
Quail dont seem to reproduce without a mail in pen as prolifically as female chickens. You are more likely to find that quail will hatch..,  former chicken farmer...
Pretty cool mate
I’m inspired!  I can’t wait to hear if your video created a nuclear shit storm with the powers that be😅
WHAT are you doing with all the chuckies??
Staged. I won't subscribe
Who buys quail eggs to have for breakfast
This video made my day. Your excitement is contagious ❤ thank you 😊
I have purchased Trader Joe’s, fertilized eggs, and fertilized eggs from the grocery store.  Trader Joe’s I had 4 develope, but only 2 hatched.  Non of the supermarket.  I was excited also even though I’m a chicken fan here.   if you don’t find it exciting, then I question why you raising chickens if you’re not a chicken fancier.
Loved it!!!!!❤❤❤
I’m more impressed that an Amazon incubator worked rather than a chick acc hatching
Can you try with regular supermarket eggs. Thanks.  Love your video.
Mate this is legendary ❤
Found this video by accident, seeing your face and reaction as they hatched was just priceless and lovely. We keep getting further away from nature, this used to be a norm for everyone. Keep up increasing the army!
Keeping them in cold delays any development, kinda like frozen eggs which is why there was an intital delay of growing. I think it's a beautiful thing to do.
So was the "army" meant to be food or were they meant for hatching?
In an America our eggs are not fertilized. So this won’t work. But now I’m questioning it all! We have chickens. So I know my eggs won’t work! No Roos
brilliant idea....
This is real sustainable living.
nice you are so enthousiastic and i got me to this is so musch fun thnx.
Why was this video so emotional 🤣🤣🤣
om*g
Its brilliant
sorry i was eating an 2 eggs while watching this video
Once you purchase the eggs, it not the stores or companies' business what you do with them.
Never been so shook in my life this is mental
That's so cool but come on sooky Bubba they aren't life until they start to incubate lol plenty of us wat eggs free range that have had roosters you eat them fresh that day no hens been sitting on them
they can still be breakfast tough
what is the music at 8:33 can someone name it please
Wendy comedy sugar i wanna do what do you doing and city actually happens porque está buena sí baby shakes bebop todo bien amazing i wanna pictures so this is something that i really liked 🙀😻😻
You did so much technically wrong and had such success regardless. I just put mine in lockdown yesterday. Hope it goes well.
As I watch this video 11 days after it was released, he got 1.93M subs in total. The same number as the hatching quails!
Yo Jay how’s life treating you? I’m genuinely curious how it’s going with Chloe, ofc it’s none of my business and I don’t want you to feel like you need to reply or anything but how about a small life update?
Your vids just don't stop hitting lately jeeez, top tier mate
you probably just put lots of people out of work. You didn't need to show the egg company name. Also this is a anti abortion video in effect.
The thumbnail is very very eye catching
Most supermarket eggs are washed meaning they can't be hatched and they literally spoil due to being washed
Eggcellent effort!
Don't tell them about Howtobasic
go vegan now dude!!or just stop eating eggs atleast
so youre lying?
That heater sucks
They're so cute.  I think your cat would've liked watching them.
There is something oddly spiritual about being apart of the egg hatching process. Proud of ya for involving yourself into the world of bird eggs, not many dudes on youtube would do such a thing. Your excitement made it all the more worth it to watch through. Happy to know the chicks are gonna be thrivivng someplace other than the room you set up for them. Their bird dander is not something you really want to be living with in close quarters. Bless ya dear. Newly subscribed.
So. Many. Eggiessss❤
I remember subbing you a while back when u renovated your room, somehow i was unsubbed when checked today
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins. Repent of what the New testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel get baptized and obey the teachings of Jesus. The gospel and the teachings of Jesus are documented in Matthew Mark Luke and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved God bless you all. If you have faith in Jesus through your faith you will live life with him as your example..,
❤❤❤❤ I hatched 21/30 chicks on Thanksgiving 2023 but I have roos so I was expecting high odds!  In the US we don't see fresh quail eggs or chicken eggs unrefrigerated so the chances of hatch are far lower unless they're purchased at a local farm! I love your babies!❤❤❤
I love your excitement. Those babies are precious 🥰
Honestly was a little to think about, watching a little baby be born due to nursing something sold for food? Back to health.. just that possibility making such a hassle for these little eggies just to perish, but to be brought back..?
I’m so glad I’m allergic to eggs and I’m vegetarian.  Now I want a quail army too.
Is jake paul originally from uk? He doesn't have the accent anymore
Wow. So that’s why our eggs are washed and refrigerated in America over here. Huh!
Hi Jay I’ve recently been diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer and I’m only 17 however watching your videos and old tgf videos has helped me a lot
Put a dispenser with lava in outside the hatching chamber and you got yourself an automated chicken farm
ayyyy! I went to a place to buy quails (for food) and they said "Okay, do you want them alive of dead". I came back with two new children that day. They are getting fat 'cause they get sun for a good chunk of the day ,  all the food and water they want, etc. One of them is calm and the other is extra feisty but I love them both.
that's actually crazy
when’s the next childish drop
You would make a very caring father!😁
The only thing that would have made this video better would be a video call to the quail expert to show off the army, you would have blew her sockz off!! <3 big love
Seems unnecessary to have jeopardized those farmer’s livelihood by showing the supermarket they came from :x
Bruv I’ve missed you
So what is going to happen with the super market and the quail egg brand? This could be detrimental to the development of yheir company... Eek. But its so wrong to lie for money like that.
You should show this video to the manufacturer. I wonder what theyd say.
Does this only work or quail eggs? Or do chicken eggs work too? I subbed purely for this video 😂
You're actually supposed to stop turning before they hatch, I think from memory it's 1--2 days before they hatch that you stop turning them, machine shouldn't be activating to indicate turns at the same time as births are expected
Entertaining and educational! Makes you think a little bit more about the food we eat and how disconnected we are from it. Thanks Jay!
Okay, great video, but what came first, the quail or the egg???
Oh wow!
I love hatching chicks and monitoring their growth, it is so freaking exciting and amazing ❤️
This is why in the US our eggs are refrigerated at all times after leaving the farm. The only way we could do this is to buy eggs at a farmers market
What are you going to do with all the chicks now??
You know there is a whole youtube channel called "a chick named Albert" thats based off him hatching a quail egg from a local grocery store...
https://www.youtube.com/@AChickCalledAlbert has been doing this for years.
What will you do with the eggs
Impossible.   Eggs are kept at frigid temperatures that an embryo could not survive.......also, egg farms do not have roosters which you need to make an embryo......so, got any more bridges in Africa you want to sell me?
Awesome
i love your strength and compashon.
From breakfast to dinner
a pathetic and tricked way for people to subscribe hahahahaha, you're all so gullible it's embarresing
Next vid, ”quail stew” 😂❤️
guys these youtubers do this a lot, those hatched quail eggs werent any sainsburys hahahahahaha they get fertilized eggs and stick them in there...... dont be so stupid and gullible ffs
they are sooo cute i want them
This is super exciting
I'm so confused. The quail expert said that you only had a >10٪ chance of hatching an egg, but over 50% hatched. So, does this specific company sell fertilized eggs? I'm just bewildered.
God bless❤
this is genuinely beautiful
Omg😱
At 27 years of age I got tears running down from seeing the eggs hatch. Good on you Jay for what you did. Top man
Where did you get that egglamp checker Jay?  I don't see an Amazon link for it in the description.
I'm pretty sure in the US that's impossible. They usually kill male chicks right out of the egg to insure this kind of thing doesn't happen. Then also, they keep the chickens so locked up that they have no free movement.
One of the lamest video...sounded a kid trapped in man's body,  the over acting was boring to watch. Btw Eggs are lifeless untill incubated so no harm in eating them.
your squeals of delight at finding life in those first 12 eggs were so sweet and wholesome!! you have a new sub here!!
Came across your channel today, i absolutely love your personality. its always nice to see a man sound like me when i find an animal or help one. !! Keep up the good work. So happy. I cried when she hatched!!
Let's face some facts ,you proved the entire world wrong 👍you put all that work in just to put them in a sanctuary.👎only gained 23 k subs how is this not blowing g up regardless. Definitely a hidden message though
I’m just wondering what is he going to do with the chickens?
2:37 that was uncalled for
2:37 that was uncalled for 💀
Omg I can’t believe it worked! There’s loads😮 I’m not even vegetarian but.. idk this makes me some sorta way about everything eating eggs again
I just found your channel and this has me obsessed! Love your energy
Nah the quails defeated me at the hatching
Just a friendly heads up for Jay and anyone considering doing this. I did this 5 years ago, and I hatched every egg in a carton I got from Sainsbury’s. I had planned to keep them for life, but what you don’t expect is the quails to become territorial in adulthood and kill each other, which is what happened in the enclosure I built for mine. Don’t make the same mistake I did. They do become territorial, and you will lose some if you don’t plan in advance for that stage.
You must handle the eggs with gloves, and also  rotate the eggs like turn them over. Eggs from chickens, etc, can take up to 24 days. You're irresponsible,  now people are going to overload sanctuaries.
Omg I'm so exited your crazy your the besti liked and subscribed for you
I can't subscribe because Quails are too cute to defeat. Should of thought of a better reason.
Do chicken eggs now
Just wait until you have your own kids
I’ve missed tgf but knowing that Jay posts makes my day so much better. Jay I watched ur channel when I was in a dark place and bakery did anything but for years of watching you and everyone else you are truly the reason I am who I am today and I couldn’t thank you enough and everyone else for making me happy when my life was so low , thank you Jay so much ❤️
The quail wars has just begun
Love the content!!! New subscriber here   Pls keep going 🎉
Did you ever call that person from the beginning of the video to tell her what happened? I think she would be very surprised. I love your videos and hope to see more like this :)
Oof damn they so cute, not sure I can look at eggs the same way now 🤣
new subbie! would you please keep us updated on their progress? 🥺💞
Jays a dad yeah.... Mad 🐦
Even better more natural 😭
your an egg cellent hatcher
Incubating eggs can be very addictive. I’ve incubated over 150 chickens.
“Sometimes… the farm might not have enough eggs to satisfy the Supermarkets order… so they take  the fertilized ages and lump them in…. “  I can’t help but wonder… purchasing 350 eggs in that short time, increases the demand on the supplier and likely increased the chances of eggs being from the boy and girl pens. If so that would mean that normal shoppers had a higher chance of consuming a fertilized egg 😢
I don’t know how I came across this video or your channel but I’m still glad I did that was freaking amazing wow❤😮🎉
Those little ones are imprinting on you....YOUR MOM!  Congratulations.
Another reason not to eat eggs. Just chicken period
this is fake
"All the other videos are fake"  A chick called Albert...
1 st off, Who do these people think they are?!!! I can DO Whatever I Want cuz it's MY LIFE & then I'd flip them off for them trying to Run My Life!!!  NO ONE Tells ME what I Can and cannot DO!!  He's soooooo cute!!! Good job man :)
Yo Jay I also got another idea you could also make a chocolate slip n slide or try make something out off chocolate like a tower or a car
as long as there isn't an embryo when I crack open my breakfast I honestly don't mind. If you keep chickens there's always a chance they might be fertilized as well and we still eat them as well. So what did you do with the chicks?
So many have hatched eggs from sainsburys, Asda etc. I still want to try it myself! 😅
Omg they are sooo cuuuute!
My mom.died in February A few  month after my nan in November my life was ripped to pieces. So I went and brought some birds.. zebra finches. The best thing I done I loved them to bits till I got home other day they have died from some kind of illness but happy I had them ill post a video..
😂😂 come at me bro bring ur army I got a hulk
im eating a 4 egg omelette as im watching this
💕🐣🐥💕
super fire! thats so wild... homie is playing lottery with the chicken species lmaoo
Thats it i am vegetarian now
You should av eaten them 😂
Love u your videos are amazing I ❤ you
Sir your video is so interesting I started watching from beginning till the end only one egg is fertile entire all those eggs I am also create video if you have time then please visit 🙏❤
soo.. the fact you can hatch eggs from a supermarket, means the eggs are fertilized?  kinda gross X)
I wish I could do this for a living
max fosh did it first
Actually a huge W of a video. More entertaining than mr beast for sure
Every life is a life and it's precious. I hope you're vegan 😊
Candle the egg. Put in fridge till you have enough to put in the incubator. Once in incubator  you cannot add more.
amazing
As someone who raises and hatches chicks, the egg turner needs to be turned off the last 3 days of incubation. The humidity also needs to be adjusted during the final days of incubation.
😮 but what happens to the quails? You cant keep 190 of them, right?
OMG
These chicks biggest flexes will be that they were from Sainsbury’s
This dude had a zero percent chance yet he still didnt give up. This video goes to show that hard work pays off bigtime!
Been subscribed for years but if I wasn’t, I would’ve because of this video😂❤
Fun fact if you live in the US you can buy fertilized eggs from Trader Joe’s 👍
🤯
so are you actually considering going vegan, since your shift in moral perspective? (the eggs will eventually stop being produced if we don't support them with our money)
youluv u <3
Try the Indian Brahman chicken at 14 pounds
Make a part 2, I want to see them grow :)
The eggs weren’t refrigerated at the store?
What kind of incubator is that?
just found you. How adorable!! Cheered me right up, thank you Just subbed.
Life is a Bute
Can’t lie this is the best video I’ve ever seen
Bro what is your accent   WEINSSSS
I would get jacked on those 720million eggs 🥚
Dude! What a wonderful vid.
Fucking love u so much can’t believe it as hell u need to do tgf man it’s so shit u can’t
It is such a coincidence that the subscriber are 1.93 M too
i love chickens and quails so much 🥹 i don’t eat eggs as i’m a vegan, and just looking at all those little babies makes me glad i haven’t accidentally eaten one 😂 amazing video as always jay !
They are SO CUTEEEE
they have a lot of babys
This is astonishing but also horrific that fertilised eggs are being sold in this way. Thank you for bringing this to the attention of the public as well as for your care for the army!  What about chicken eggs? Sometimes i have seen what looked like “something” in the yolk but put it out of my mind because i “knew” that chicken eggs were unfertilised…. Now i am not so sure :(  what will you be doing with your army?
Wow this video is amazing, I definitely enjoyed watching every second of it. I’d really love to do this myself
I love now to hack eggs but i cant
Hope you turned off the rotation.
Still havent eaten eggs in a week thanks Jay
Some supplier out there just lost a contract😪
Wft dude , they all alive now , could see the real world from previously just an egg that we consume everyday and now it turns to be a chicks , respect at least the guy save the ecosystem from the chicks
Knowing how the chicken egg industry works, this is fake… wow people are gullible
no way that wouldve been food!
Ooh Coturnix.
my dumba$$ thinking "how do you hatch a supermarket out of an egg"??
someones not gonna have heated water for a month
The bottom is the part of the egg that forms the chicks bones.
Wawooooo🐥🐣🐔
Wow! It wonderful!
Is it just quail eggs or can you do it to chicken eggs too
Was clarence court exposed?
The only way you could do that in America is with Farm Fresh Eggs, because in the grocery store they are already refrigerated here.
Looks like some poor Quail egg farmer is going to lose their contract,  350 eggs and 193 hatched chicks.  That is a huge number compared to what was expected.
The United Kingdom
This is actually such an amazing, wholesome and inspirational video. Thank you for this Jay.
Awhhh Jay, this is so cute I actually cried 😭 🥰❤️
I am so happy a ran the video solid
Wow
It’s the CBRN trousers 😂😂😂😂
How interesting. Greed is the name of the game. Doesn't matter if the farmer or the supplier lose their contracts. At least you got your views and ad revenue.
hi  ive always wondered about  this   liked and sub.  xx
What did you do with them?
Super curious can you do the same with the chicken eggs you get at the store. Like the ones not in the fridge on the shelves only or can you do that with the ones that are in the fridge section? This is so interesting and I would really hate it if I killed a future life. I love animals and one day want chickens and this is a great way to save lives.
how do we know u are not lying?
Best video of today, hats off man😎
the happines at 6:38 just made me smile :3
Come back next time, when jay buys a pint of milk, and grows it into a prized bull.
They are so cute❤
ابو الروب🤡🤡🤡
It was the cutest thing ever watching you get exćited over the egg
If you go to the channel A Chick Called Albert, he started his channel by hatching a quail he name Albert from supermarket eggs!! Hes awesome, one of my favorite channels by far, you should check him out!! Albert has long sice passed away now, but bc of him, the man who hatched him  and started the channel now has a whole animal sanctuary❤ Hes also like a bird specialist, I love him!!
Jay  U R big legend bro, I'm going to Sainsbury's, and I'm getting quail eggs from Sainsbury's in Asda and Tesco. I'm going to do it the same way as you a legend
should have eaten them u not even keeping the quails  u just made it some 1 els problem
سارقها من ابو الرب 🤨
Don't tell the supermarket so that we can all try this😂
Lol you dork
I don't know about quail eggs but chicken eggs are fine as most of the ones you buy in the supermarket aren't fertilized. Chickens regularly lay infertile eggs as a sort of period. They often lay daily but in Winter and as they get older they lay less. Have you watched "A chick called Alfred" He does a lot of hatching stuff from an experiment similar to this to hatching wild eggs in need.
I think this whouldnt happen in most of europe since egg controlls are pretty hard and I think selling fertile eggs to a super market whould go really bad really quick
Nice wooting you got their ;)
I actually can never eat eggs again 😭 subscribed!
That’s crazy
That’s crazy
*Why quail eggs and not chicken eggs?*
Now u can eat the meat when they grow up 😂
This video was brilliant. I can’t believe you hatched any yet alone so many. That is incredible. You are really engaging and your videos are really interesting. Good work. You made me smile.
i just know you, and now i'm subscribing  such a wholesome video !
Let's start eating consciously
We're all these eggs from the store?
Go away. 😂
Was really  expecting this to be a fake video you wasnt so i subbed W mans
0:04 why is looks like pp
bro just opened a door to consumer shortcut with a sprinkle of corrupt ethics, but bro, this kinda makes me wanna shine a flashlight at every egg I find in a supermarket. I've known about quail eggs and their possibility of hatching a chick but this has made it so cute, I can't bare thinking some posh persons lunch was a a cute baby. aw bless it's heart and bless yours for giving a project meaning.
GAINED A SUB
my guy just played GOD
Dude you are so funny. You'd think you were having quads. Chill and breath.............haha!
people will believe anything.
Mate what’s happening to the quails after this ?
I love these kinds of videos ❤
🥽 🦃🙃🤣
Bro what are u doing with all these quails plz make a follow up
Eggs are literally unlimited
Why are you still so hot?
Welcome to the world❤ thanks for giving them a chance to live
Congrats daddy quail
what will u do with all these chicks, man?
Bruh she told you that you 0 chances for legal reasons lol I bet it’s a lot easier than what she said
Jay, I think you'd enjoy watching a channel call a chick named Albert, he's done what you're doing for a long time. You might get some tips from him. It used to be & sometimes now too, for a school or nursery to get eggs to incubate for the children to watch & learn. :)
So have you had any backlash from the market?
This is such an awesome video! ❤
Can't believe I'm not seeing any comments about a chick called Albert! Gotta pay homage to the OG
Amazing! 😮😍 Would love to see an update video on how the quails are doing at the animal sanctuary!
Too cute! 🥰 Hello from Wolverhampton ☺️ new subscriber 😊  When I was a kid I often ended up having to rescue baby birds because of my cats, so I have a fondness for the little guys ❤️
Wow good video thanks
Oh my word...I just don't think I'll ever eat another egg again.  Glad they're happy at their new home❤️
The best video I've seen in a while! Love it!❤
Day 3
i might have to buy some of these eggs
I found your video in my recommended. Just subscribed....19,299 left to go 😁
Quails will only lay eggs if there’s a male near by! That’s why they are fertilized
Just found this, excellent video, I loved watching !!!! Subscribed 🛎👍
I've done this in the US with refrigerated eggs. When u bring ur eggs home, let them sit out on the counter for a day or 2, let the moisture from refrigeration dry out, then put them in an incubator dam near every egg here I've gotten from the shops here have been fertile eggs everyone I cracked open to eat! so I decide to hatch some n it worked 🎉
Over 50% hatch rate. 😮❤
How does it make you feel, that you are eating a chickens period 🤢
Omg They are adorable! Who agrees they need to be called Razzle and dazzle?
Coincidence now has it, Jay is at 1.93M subscribers..
Isn’t it fun??   I must also need to know the black object you were using to view the eggs lol I need one.
This was AWESOME! Thanks for taking us on this journey with you!  Edit: And the 400😂 this is like a dream!
Why is he british?!?!?!??!?!
your excitement is everything
Beautiful concept man,such god stuff
Wow, amazing video. Would love to see what you do with the quails as they grow? Subscribed 👍
You deserve my sub man
what is the music at 7:00 min
I love it
The fact that this guy went from being the guy went from putting concrete & a microwave on his head to hatching supermarket chicks is insane.
Awesome vid make a update video plss
I didn't see the egg candler you used in the description. I'm interested to know what you used. I've been hatching eggs foe several years. Something I learned is that I got way more eggs than I wanted chickens, ducks or geese. So, even though my eggs are fertilized and have the potential for life, I don't need that many birds, so I eat or sell the eggs. To each their own though. Great project. I'm in the market for a new incubator so I'll check out the one you used.
lol - We raise chickens and turkeys. always fun and exciting when the eggs hatch. Great Job!
Just hit subscribe
Always entertaining; never thought I'd see Jay becoming a mother lmao
You completely roasted the quail expert
Ever stop and think about the influence your videos may have on other people to copy and imitate you?  Stunts like this likely end in more harm and cruelty to animals, wether directly or indirectly.   Be a youtube star without falling back on the cute click bait animals.
Awwww a little army of Quails, how amazing youve had the facilities to do this. They are so cute. Great positive video of the day ❤❤
genuinely actually the best youtube video ive ever watched imo!🥰🥹
Jay I love this content. This was amazing I love that you kept it a secret for so long
Could of been a better video if you actually included what Sainsbury’s said or if you contacted them
1st comment since watching you from like 10 years ago. Fair play Jay awesome video
🎉
So fake it’s unreal 😂😂
193 chicks , 1.93 M subs
Jay looks like a really proud Dad
Congrats on the birth of ya babies 😂
That’s last bit was extremely cringe. You created almost 400 living beings and your final verdict is a weak refrain from going on “a vegan rant” to eat less of the 400 things you just created. Then proceed on to say some extremely weak ass meaningless quote about how beautiful it is what you can do when you “go out of your way”?you went out of your way to create your own army of chicks for content. The real reason even becomes more clear when you directly involve your chicks into a cringy narrative where they’ll win if 8400 of us subscribe to you. I’m not a vegetarian nor vegan but even im a little shocked by this extremely cringy ass morally broke content. At least take a stance on something man I don’t care what it is but there was zero take away from this all haha.
Bro please dont go vegan 🤣
Mad that we’re able to recognise that a quail egg has potential for life and that’s special…. But as soon as that’s a human embryo most people are happy for it to be aborted and not even bat an eyelid!
They have to be fertilsed!
So what’s gonna happen to chicks???
Oh my god you’re that microwave guy
Adorwable
Y’all don’t leave the plate clean from eggs?? So wasteful
Not true... there's another guy that does it all the time!! ❤❤❤  Okay okay....I subscribed just because your video rocked!! Now... go save more chick's!! How about duck eggs??
This woman is totally brain dead you know how manny people did this with success
Unfortunately we can't do this here in the states.  Our eggs come refrigerated. I've seen a couple of other videos of people hatching store bought eggs. Such an interesting concept.    New subscriber here BTW. This is the first video I have seen on this channel.  So one down. Lol
Call one Sainsburys.
Try buying them from Asian grocers.
Someone named a pig after her😂. I would be honoured. Pigs are beautiful!
You absolute legend ❤
This is one of your best videos in my opinion, i absolutely loved every minute of this, the joy in your face really brought warmed to my heart, your growing so much and i absolutely love that for you, i absolutely love watching your videos keep it up!! big love xx
Don’t think I’ll ever eat an egg again truthfully
After seeing this video....I knew...I had to subscribe!!!
This video is every child's dream when they see an egg. 😂
This is awesome!  Welcome to the world little guys and girls. Now I'm not sure I want to eat eggs anymore lol.
Bro looks like logan paul ☠️
Yo jay can I have a quail?
Ai thumbnail ❌
so whats happening with all the 193 chicks
This is a great video
Sainsburys eggs sold out after everyone saw this haha
Madness 😂👍
such a great video! you are a mad man... can I have a male and female quail pls
this is absolutely beautiful. i’ve done my research and now im also going to hatch some quail eggs.
I think she was talking about chicken eggs not quail eggs?
can u send me some chicks? ill take care of em
I did this in Germany from EDEKA chicken eggs. From the six eggs I chose, two were fertile and one hatched named it after the store 😅
Literally got the exact same incubator😂
My guy is now god, creating life and that.... Geeeee
what is happening to these babys now ?
He needs to show that lady all his quails
I subscribe
this is where the invasion starts🥶🥶🥶🥶
Love uou bro from India
idk why that lady was so adament shops would be upset. plenty ppl hatched quails from shops before bc quails are so so hard to sex when young. its not a big deal lol
Would love a follow-up videos
Add me as new..love chicks
I stumbled upon your channel by accident and this video caught my attention and now I’m hooked. Your channel deserves to be on national tv because it is so good and I love it you are the best.❤🎉
please hatch more videos jay yiu are one of the only youtubers keeping me alove i swear to fuck
What a video man. Amazing content!
amazing random video
i think u shoukd go to oldham and screem what dooooo u meannnnnnnnn wel loud      TGF DO IT
Yo can i be in ur video
Why do eggs need to be rotated. Someone please educate me.
Well done I hatched a quail from a supermarket egg. He’s called Kato after my son. He’s like the family cat. He’s adorable
You definitely deserve the Subscribe❤
One major part of why you don't want to sell fertilized eggs is because most places don't want you getting a half formed chicken in the egg lol.   Aside from that, I don't deny I'd believe the supermarkets and big box stores don't want you to do it yourself. A lot of good food knowledge is being lost because of convenience in buying.
This is hilarious because when I was a kid I so wanted a pet and my parents wouldn't let me have any, so my smart ass thought I was gonna hatch an egg. :))))) My knowledge of the matter was limited so nothing turned up. I thought in hindsight that it was stupid, that it cannot be done, yet here you are.
This was amazing! never stopped smiling and laughing. This is great content Jay🎉
Never eating quail eggs again
Great video bro but damn i miss the TGF crew and videos
Dude I'm currently hatching my own eggs from an incubator and like this video made me like 100000000000000 times more excited for them also I subbed this video was that good now I'ma watch some more of your videos
This is nuts 😂
Aww Jay this was so heartwarming!
Your excitement was so contagious! So happy to know the babies have a safe foreverr home!!!  💖💖💖
Honestly I haven’t engaged with your content in several years because it’s aimed at a younger demographic. But this was a really informative video and a good watch so well done Jay 👍🏼
Whats you going do with them all though ??? 😢
Next time on the 14th day put it on lockdown by unplugging the egg turner, and removing the egg turning disk.that way you wouldn’t have to worry about it later on. Plus not turning off the egg turner and not removing the egg turner disk could injure the chick.
Sainsburys tried to take this down yet? Absolutely loved this content btw ❤️
Oh my goodness 😢 Bless you for saving 🙏🏼 There 💞 lifes
Bro I haven't watched this but u can't hatch eggs that don't have sperm added
Damn you’re the father to so many chicks, dads gonna have a lot of young fellas to intimidate 😂
Can’t do that in the US because the make sure they can’t hatch by bleaching the eggs and refrigerating them.
This is wild I loved it
Yummy chicken 😮
Am i gonna die
We Men are so simple Our girls be thinking we are cheating.. but here a person's hatching eggs and hundred of thousands of people are watching it 😉🙂
so FAKE !!!!
I wonder how many Sainsburys eggs would hatch in the big boy incubator
Such a nice video  Wow wow wow  One of the best videos I've ever seen on YouTube you're so talented !!!!!!
I don’t know about this one Jay, I know you only see this as content but it just feels so unethical…  Maybe you could advocate for animals instead of paying for them to be mutilated and killed in their usual industries…
Yo love this act of kindness to bring new life into this earth
so happy to see you make it jay
why advertise this shit we will have to pay for it in the end
wait so them quails have hatched next to each other and are most definitely not related
Wait. So the company hatching and selling eggs to the supermarkets actually didn't seperate males from the females? Because you need a male in order to get a fertile egg. The companies should not kill all their males, because they need some for reproduction in some point. The eggs they sell are from females and supposed to be unfertilized (no male around), because females (chickens, dunno about quails, probably the same) can lay eggs without the male partner, but the eggs are just unfertilized and and are ment to be consumed for breakfast. Because of course, they want us to buy their eggs, not produce life at home. $$ I'm confused how did Jay do this. But at least he gave us a great lesson. Creating life is beautiful. Jay solved the egg shortage in the UK for 15 minutes. My science tutors didn't teach me about reproduction.
Should name  him "Wings'Bury" 🐣
Brilliant this mate
Bro this reminds me of A Chick Called Albert
"he's probably out cheating" OMGGGG I SEE HEART BEAT IN MY SUPERMARKET EGGS :D
Hairs stood up on my neck this acc makes me want to never eat eggs again
Opened my eyes!
too much asking for subscribe
That didn't look like 193 lol
Hahaha it doesn't work like this... chickens don't just make more chickens by themselves..  they need a rooster to impregnate them first and inseminate the egg... and eggs for human consumption are not kept around roosters.. it is an unfertilized egg you are eating.. basically a chickens period.
Now you can eat the quails! That’s a big protein upgrade!
most real video. love you for this!
i comment to much on your videos man bro but i watch em all back cuz theyre too good keep it up g
Enojyed that. Has Sainsburys got in touch with you yet? be interesting to hear an update from you if they ever do get in touch
Anyone have any idea where i can get the microscope from for candling the eggs
This made me remember the first time i saw a chicken hatch, life is just something else
its crazy how jay went from putting his head in a cemented microwave, to educating us on life. If that's not character development, idk what is. Love you man ♥
Anyone who believes these are Sainsbury’s eggs are so dumb😭😭
I mean, this video is SO WHOLESOME ❤️ thank you for giving those little’ns a chance! Loved the old vids but also adore these!
Knowing u you’re probably gonna let them grow up and eat them😂
Why the fuck are they selling fertilised eggs? That’s the real question
Most things are fake on the internet, but if you truly did use eggs from a supermarket, well this is just amazing. Kinda makes my stomach feel uneasy though, no eggs for me.
Aint no way bru sainsburys aint coming back from this one
Thats an awful loft of food you have there!
Bro basically ended this whole egg operation
My comrade you can still eat te eggs birds in real life eat tere own eggs or oters eggs
this needs to go down as one of the greatest discovery videos ever...
Also congrats for hatching eggs 😊
Do tgfbro again man
Pretty sure these only work in the UK
Firstly I have ALWAYS wanted a pet quail named Potato.  Secindly, I was really hoping you were gonna say "and you know what that means? Each new subscriber gets a chicken!"   I'd have been beyond ecstatic BUT I'm still gonna subscribe cause your video defeated me with cuteness at the lil bebes in the bebe quail army   *rushes to sainsbury's and amazon for... stuff*
Quail Army we come in Peace✌️
How is the cat with them?
One of your best videos for sure, I absolutely loved watching this.
This absolutely brought tears to my eyes. What an amazing and heartfelt video!
I was really hoping to see the normal eggs instead of the quail eggs.. now that would be shocking if you did the normal brown eggs you get from Sainsbury or Tesco or Asda..
Doing this waw my childhood dream
Absolutely wholesome
It’s impossible I think
Update us!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Did quail expert lady ever comment on this after your results came out?
You are telling me that I can spawn event more protein from my protein for free???
They are adorable! I’m glad they all went to a good home where they’ll only know love and kindness 🤍
we are good with eggs i own 6 chickens and thiers like 1-3 eggs in their coop everyday.
Fucking never stop being you jay! Legend
I keep quail and my hens won’t lay unless they have roosters satisfying there needs.
Please try doing this with chicken eggs.
keep us update bro its good to see you uploading fr, happy new year man
❤ beautiful x
Any update of you contacting Sainsburys etc?
ur a G
It’s put me off eggs
im eating eggs rn
My mother passed away in november due to ongoing illness, its been really tough but watching these vids has really helped me distract myself and take my mind off things for a 20 mins here and there. Thank you for the content, you've made a massive impact on my mental state over the last couple of months and keep doing what youre doing, absolutely loving how unique and interesting your content has become💜
What a video!! Jay is top 5 UK youtuber, no question. This content is amazing!
I cried happy tears well done jay xxx
When I found out on Ark That I could hatch Dino eggs😂😂
New sub here…. Can’t believe I’m just discovering this channel… but about that whole sub army vs quail army thing.. umm, I’m not exactly fond of humans… but unfortunately, like quails, I tend to get lonely myself, so it’s a bit of a catch 22… so my question is, is there any way I can fight on the side of the quail army instead of the sub/human (😏subhuman) army? I could never go to battle against such cute little creatures.. but I have no qualms against fighting alongside my quail comrades.   🙍🏼‍♂️ ⚔️ 🐦
Fake.
I loved this. Seeing you so genuinely happy was lovely.  Watching something I never thought possible was also very eye opening.  Very much enjoyed! 😊
just when you think its over lol 190 more
That would go great on a full english
👁️👁️   👅🙏... Hummmmmmmmm ...
This is absolutely amazing I couldn't believe it it's insane and probably the best video I have seen in a long time x
His accent is so annoying !!!
woow now i can get a 6 dollars back of eggs turn them to chicken then eat them😋
honestly man im not quite sure what id do without u on this platform. whenever i need something to watch ill just be scrolling for ages and nothing catches my eye until i see that u posted a new video and it finally gives me something to watch. although the videos are usually no longer than 15 mins at least i get some entertainment for 15 mins even from something as simple as hatching eggs🤣. thank you man keep up the work and i hope u start uploading more and more so im not bored shitless at home
I don’t understand how they hatch? How are the fertilized??
*This style of content suits you Jay. The corruption investigator type.. *
Jay this is such a lovely video. Good shit
We love watching. As soon as the kids told us you were from where we live we had to watch it just makes it so much funnier knowing ur from where we are. Dow know what um gonna do with all them birds when there bigger 😂 x
Just so you know, this is the first video I have seen from you and the topic is interesting to me but you begged for subscribers so many times I won't be watching any more from you cause its not a good vibe.
mmmmmm breakfast
I knew there was a reason I never liked eating eggs
Josh & Archie did it first  Sainsbury and all
Did you contact Sainsbury's for a comment?
What a great watch! Need more vids with this style
who wnn buy TGF cards ? or swap ?
you're one of the few youtubers that i genuinely enjoy watching since 2016-2017 your content inspires me to think outside the box and get my creativity groove on .. honestly i don't know how to thank you enough for being there for me in my darkest days and making me get up and do minor things .. keep up this amazing work and i support you fully .. i know you may never see this but thank you jay .. this video is plain wholesome to someone who majors in biology like me i recommend it especially to those who love embryology. keep the army warm!!
QUAIL ARMY, QUAL ARMYYYY 🎵
Legend
Loving this video
13:17 when I clicked this video i would have never thought I would see a dramatic quail hatching edit, this deserves a sub
got to love the CBRN trousers haha, those ones are still in service too
WOW
Brilliant...the only problem is you are probably going to go missing...like the water power car guy and Mr Diesel...make a video saying you will not harm yourself....watch your back mate...you have gone and rocked the boat way high...becareful from Dublin.
Oops Sainsbury's are going to need to have a talk with that quail egg supplier 😂
Did you get the subs? 😮❤
The absolute, giddy excitement you got, when one of the eggs showed a heartbeat, bro, it made me so happy. It was adorable! Congrats on the lil army :)
You’re a hero Jay.
fuck you Jay! im going broke cuz of this shit! :D
Are you keeping your army or are you handing them to a new leader?
W mans
It’s amazing to see the progress you’ve made in terms of content quality
Jay I enjoyed your video as always but please please please tell me you’re going to look after them until they pass.. you and most others have NO IDEA how these beings are treated on farms (free range or not) they live lives of misery. And even if you play devils advocate and say “ I know someone with quails and they run about loving life” or some other bs, where do you think they will end up?? If your answer is in a slaughterhouse without a head.. you are correct
Been hatching for years lots of fun another great video thanks 😊😊
Quickest subscription of my life, amazing video
Now try it with chicken eggs and duck eggs 🥚
#QUAILARMYTAKEOVER
Jay you are such a sweatheart i love you my guy and i am glad that i can watch this wholesome man that you've ever been <3
9:29 ‘two Sainsbury’s eggs, two fokin Sainsbury’s eggs’ 😭😭😂😂😂😂
What breed are the quail chicks from Sainsbury’s?
Of course the corrupt sistem will tell you is imposible. So you will buy only from super markets. And not to raise your own. 👍👏🤝
Is it just me or do we all want to go and do this now? 😂
Wow!
“Your from Sainsbury’s “😂😂😂😂
bro this video got me PUMPED baby quails, angering sainsburys and your storytelling ability all combined into this perfect video, see ya now I'm off to grab an incubator and some duck eggs!
don't use AI for thumbnails
Jay actaully deserves MrBeast type subscribers.
Bro you're a legit top tier content creator that's craazy.
and thats how jay became vegan
Inspirational 1
I got 6 chickens last yea and its  the most fun rewarding experience, couldn't recommend it more
TGF helped me lift myself out of so many depressive episodes. i found myself having a big goofy smile on my face through almost all tgf videos. thank you Jay and Romell.
Great video olney problem I was eating eggs when I watched:😂😂
your reactions to the heartbeat was sooo cute
This is super impressive, wonder what Sainsburys had to say 😂
I learned that breakfast can be lunch and dinner
Swinglers paid her my mate
I don’t think Sainsbury’s will be that bothered, this seems more like an ad for them tbh
Nice video but what’s with the relentless begging for subs? You got almost 2m and you’re likely a multi millionaire already
W video love it man
Seeing the birth of an animal is a really precious and mesmerising experience. My dog gave birth last year to six pups and it was so beautiful to be present to witness the first moments of their lives.   Also I’ve been watching Jay for almost 10 years, it’s really great to see how far he has come. He always gives us the best of the best content and how devoted he is to what videos he makes is special because it’s rare these days. Anyone will make anything just to get views and fame, Jay does it because he genuinely enjoys it. To watch him go from bathing in nettles to hatching baby quails, who would have thought? 😂👏
<33~
OMD
Real life CryptoZoo 😂. I nearly sent you £1000 for a limited edition hybrid Snake cross Logan …….   Snogan Quail the BIG Fail    🐍
How much to cook one
thats soo cool
This video just made my entire year, and we've only just hit March. You got a new sub from me brother <3
WTF thats crazy, not sure I will be eating eggs soon
This was so fucking cute - most i've smiled in a while. I love when people bring life to things that would have been taken away for something else
a reason to be vegan. thank you for giving them a chance at life ❤
What you gonna do with them ?
uh oh! or oh goody i should say maybe.. does this mean this video is the arc for jays vegetarian movement? 👀
I grew up on a ranch eating fresh eggs. I love raising chickens but I won't stop eating eggs.  I also had a friend that had a bunch of quails and she was a chef in Seattle the first time I ever tried a fried quail egg they are very good but they're only one bite.  She gave me a quail to keep as a pet unfortunately it flew out of the window at my house.
Just came across this video and  I loved the video and definitely subscribed within 1 minute of watching 😊😊😊
Life finds a way.
are you gonna keep them all?
So, some family lost their income for this video. Well done.
That’s awesome but dammm that’s a lot of quails 😂😂
There’s should be less life in supermarket eggs than there is life in a man’s balls
Just taking other people's videos now 😴
Am gutted I had 9 zebra finches built an avery for them. Unfortunately I got home yesterday to find them all dead. So this video cheered me up a bit. Thanks.
best youtube video ever. thanks for doing this. please post updates. super cute lol
This is so cool
If the suppliers used unfertilized eggs it wouldnt be such an issue with us eating them, because theyre fertilized it makes us feel horrible for it now. I work with eggs and we order in loads, like we use a box a day (500+ eggs per box) some of them have blood in, meaning an embryo, this is sad & i hope it brings suppliers to do their job properly.
Going from tgf to this is CRAZY
if youve got a chicken you can do this by putting them under them aha, everyone i know who has or had chickens have hatched supermarket eggs that way, its pretty interesting rly and i suppose is a good indicator of freshness and also a testament to how well evolved eggs are as a form of protection for the embryo  (also tesco is the most common for success for some reason lmao)
This is awesome ❤
L video. Chicken eggs are almost always non-fertilized. Which is why he used quail eggs and not chicken. "Store-bought eggs" 99.9% of the time refer to chicken eggs.
Last year, i cracked an egg and a half born chicken was in it. I can't eat eggs since or especially crack them. That was from Aldi
They could all be fertile but u won’t know in the first day u have to wiait a week😊
Im gonna go check to see if Sainsbury’s have taken these eggs off the shelf.
yall are getting touchy about saving baby chicks but are okay with abortion ? human fetus’ get their heartbeat at 3 weeks… but nah thats just a “clump of cells”.
What a video!! You’re a genius mate😂
What are you going to do with all the chicks?
wow this is crazy and cool
What gonna happen to the chicks
Didn't know I needed a quail army
Imma do it it with chicken eggs and defeat your army 😂😂😂😂😂
caviar next, so we can doom the economy
New subscriber here 😮👏❤️
The comments 😭
need to show the lady from the beginning the vid n show her reaction
What r u going to do w them?
What did the super market say?!
Quail merch when?
What a sidequest
What an awesome video Jay! i love them so much 🔥
It's a special moment to hatch your own eggs
How cute!! Thank you for saving them❤
This is the best YouTube video I have ever watched
Love this video long time fan haven’t watched in awhile really brought me back always great content
A guy did this before you
try it with chicken eggs
FUK SANSBURY 🔥🔥🔥
LETS GO JAYYYYYYY
factory farming is disgusting, you must stop sopporting it, NOW.
So are all the eggs from sainsburys or just the first two .
Get a life
Oi mate!!!
What I find absolutely amazing is I can see the maturity in you as you've grown as a youtuber over the years. Granted you did throw a giant curveball with the hatching 300 eggs attempt but this is definitely one of your standout videos for sure. Keep doing this bro!
I thought this was impossible because the eggs aren’t fertilized at the supermarket
Jay is truly one of the few great content creaters left on youtube
I dont wanna eat eggs anymore they so cute
wanted more quail content
New here 👋🏼  You just popped up on mine today. Have to say this is super cool! I wish this were possible in the US. Unfortunately ours are sprayed and refrigerated.
that lady seemed cool
Sainsbury’s be like 👁️👄👁️
Its a rare chance to get but if you want viable eggs just get some from a reputable breeder also quail eggs have a lot more vitamins and nutrients then chicken eggs also sometimes breeders miss gender birds and that will cause fertile eggs in pens tho its rare lol If you live in the usa or Canada myshire farm is a good breeder for eggs also u need to turn off rotation a few days before so they dont sufficate before hatching or fall off edge and break a leg
yo this editing so smooth, and that room part is sick
"Where are they now" episode coming?
So cool!
Cheers Jay, grans just started a campaign to cancel eggs and is now in every Tesco and Sainsbury’s saying “cmon the eggs”, thanks mate.
I’m never eating eggs again.
Man just made a full army 😂😂😂😂
I think he should try ostrich eggs 😃🙌😭
That is crazyyyyyy 😳😳😳😳
The local Meole brace Sainsbury’s 😂😂😂
Fake asf lmao
so what are you going to do with the quails when they are grown?
Just saying the first one should be called Peter Quail
do chicken eggs
That army plot twist had me cracking up ffs
This was such a good video! Makes me really want to do it myself, they are so cute!!
deadly vid man keep it up ❤
Although TGF was great, this content hits on a whole different level..... well done!
Unbelievable 😂❤
how the lady react to the news?
Always finish my eggs :)
the wooting 60he and the super light gpro goes hard 🔥
Fake…..
My friend did this too 😅
🥚 Who knew eggs could lead to such an egg-citing adventure! 🐣 This is egg-ceptional creativity at its finest!  🛒🥚
then you go and eat chicken, makes sense
im never eating eggs again bro 🤣
This is so cool! I have been wanting to raise quail as they can be a sustainable source of eggs and you can sell them to make extra income!
Impossible to hatch ANY supermarket eggs. Eggs need to be fertilised. Supermarket eggs are NOT fertilised. None of them even see a male for fertilization. Although 1 in 1million may get through them chance still is pretty impossible
ah dammit ............subscribed 😑
People will watch this…and STILL eat eggs🤣 same ones will. Liam they “animal lovers” 🤣🤣
I hope this isn't fake
They taste good tho 😩❤️
I love this! What happens to all the little quails now? Do you keep them?🥲
Love videos like this so entertaining/enjoyable, actually crazy you done this I was thinking of doing it not long ago but didn’t have the money to do it but at least I know you can do it now thanks jay
I am never eating eggs again. This is crazy!!!
swear, if i didnt have cats i'd have pet quails
That is awesome 😮,  great job, 👍
HMMMM MY chicken nugget <3 jkjk
I have found lots of fertile eggs in America. I used that exact incubator and only got 2 fresh eggs to hatch out of 12. Twice now.
Youd be such a great dad you know jay
Congratulations Jay🎉
What a stupid and fake video.
What it is with people wasting food… everyone knows how much they can eat you’ve literally had years to figure that out lol. Yet people will cook too much or have too much on there plate
Your content is so warming and soo authentic. I’ve been watching TGF and your content for years. People would think it’s soo random and it is 😂 but in the best way. Love the content 💜
Chicken eggs now 👀😅
this was the most wholesome video ever, I really am enjoying the new content jay :)
Nice work bassem
Seeing you get so excited seeing movement, a great warm video Jay. These videos that you get to do because YOU want to is something I enjoy seeing. And who hasn't wanted to hatch eggs before!
Jay is THE YouTuber.
I hope everything is going well for you Jay, these last few months have been hard for me I was in a vehicle accident and I know life is hard, I hope everything for you is going well. I hope you are happy or on your way towards it, the people that seem the most happy can often be the ones hurting the most. Much love man, hope you meet you one day
omg, the guy who jumped into spiky bushes and stuck his head in microwave is hatching eggs now. great content btw. the last time i checked tgfbro was like 2018. Great to see him back. W youtube recommendation
We have chickens and actually only eat the eggs from them! The yolks are so rich and much tastier than store-bought, and I love including them in my baking. I highly recommend chickens to those who have the space and ability to care for them. If you're up for the meat birds, go for it, but the eggs are the best part for me, personally. We even trade our chickens eggs to people we know who give us fresh garden grown veggies and/or large game/fish they've hunted. We get loads of salmon and moose during the summer, lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Dont say “omfg” this is blasphemy
Eddie feeling real bad right now
It would have been breakfast, but now it can be lunch😂
Very wholesome video. It made me reevaluate my view on eggs, however… This court case is going to be chaotic 🤣💀
Not breakfast anymore.... their dinner! 😂
F’s in the chat for the supplier losing their big boy contract from Sainsbury’s. Maybe should’ve covered the brand
Thank you for all your efforts caring for the chicks 🩵 please keep them safe
I fuckin love this video
Fake . The egg would need 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit to start any development and be maintained until hatching  eighteen and if you buy it at a supermarket it would not be viable because the heat was lost . And the veins in the egg wouldn’t be there because the eggs are mechanically inspected for exactly that . These are obviously eggs from a breeder or farm that stored them correctly until they enter the incubator . I’m a farmer  for my own  extended  family and  believe me I know my eggs and incubation methods and mishaps .
The chicken army is here 😂❤
Does it smell or it will
So happy to see you upload Jay! I love the effort you put into your videos for us. It warms my heart when you say you read the comments, it makes me feel appreciated and seen :) Love, An Australian Fan
Hahaha she left jay speechless when she said about the pig. Thought all egg should be infertile. I don’t know if I trust jays science 😂😂
Just insane
I'm sorry but DO NOT hold the baby's wait a day or to and leave them in the thing THEY POSOBLIY WILL DIE From oils if their feathers isn't fully developed
What I find absolutely amazing is I can see the maturity in you as you've grown as a youtuber over the years. Granted you did throw a giant curveball with the hatching 300 eggs attempt but this is definitely one of your standout videos for sure. Keep doing this bro!
The thumbnail is Top Notch Well Done buddy :)
That is actually unbelievable fair play jay! amazing stuff lovely watch!
Jay’s about to inspire a whole bunch of people to get down to their local Sainsbury’s and buy a bunch of quail eggs
The maddest thing about eating eggs is they put all the male chicks, while alive, in a blender cus they dont need them, i cant really talk cus i eat eggs but it is kinda mad
fuck this im going Sainsbury's bruv
This really shocked me. Im happy that you are now a father of these cute and wonderful quails and just shows that anything is possible if you don't give up.
i was sat eating scrambled eggs on toast watching this and i now feel violently unwell
I'm at a loss for words
14:32  The cognitive dissonance is real loooooool
I hatched mine here in the usa. I have 11 right now and more in the incubator. You needed to take the egg turner out three days before the hatch date. Join the group here in the US about hatching store brought eggs LOL.
chunky paragraph
Bros either just exposed a crime or committed one…
Wow this was amazing to watch ❤
This man just unlocked an infinite egg glitch
I might try your idea from Sainsbury's jay. Thank you for saving the army 💪🏻💪🏻. So great to watch them hatching 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣
I remember you as the crazy guy who would jump of the roof to a trampoline
You should try caviar fish eggs
Unreal content pal. Fully engrossed from beginning to end, just wondering what are you going to do with the quails? If I were you I’d keep a girl and boy and continue expanding you quail lineage.
CHICKENNN LESGOOOO
Nice one mate !!! Very interesting Video ! Subscribe for the quail army 😁👌🏼
Do more I actually fucking loved this
I simp for jay
I usually never comment but this… this… is a banger and I haven’t even finished the vid
Jay you missed off the link to Sainsbury’s for the eggs pal
thats so flipin cute! :D
You can bye them fertiliserd on the Internet 🙄
Congrats on being a papa to lots of baby quails 🥲 they’re so adorable! This video honestly made me so happy and seeing the accomplishment on your face was unreal ! This content you’ve been making recently is the best you’ve done. I’m so proud of the person you’ve become Jay, so much love ❤
From having poo poo on his back to creating life, what a legend !
What happend to you and romel
Sainsburys egg profits about to sky rocket .
Absolutely unreal this .. your some man for one man 👍 respect brother ❤
At first I was like nah fake but then remembered its jay he is a crazy mofo and doesnt fake shit then seen them hatch no way he actually done it massive respect I now want to try but I have cats and ferrets not a good idea. Nice one man
it  was so good ff
How is he gonna keep track of the original 2
The Father of Quails🤣🙏
amazing. we love you
fire video now eat it
Mate you have outdone yourself man I've been a fan of you and childish merch for a long time but honestly this bought a tear to my eye you really bring light in dark situations and that was demonstrated in this video top man!
Aww how cute
This is beautiful
its been very entertaining to watch your content grow and change over the years with your channel aswell as TGF it always felt like the little thing that nobody around me knew about so it was always nice to have my own little funny zone of youtube to go to when i got bored or frustrated with everything else big ups from the usa been a fan since 2017 love you jay
Its honestly crazy to see how far you've came, from the TGF days all the way to being the Dad of an army of quails (had  never heard of quails before i saw this video). Keep it up Jay, you're a fucking inspiration mate   only 19,299 subs togo
I would like to know what happens now. Are you keeping them as pets or going to rehome them? They’re cute. 🥰
I am still eating eggs, fuck it 😂
Amazing video ❤
Yeah, like you don't ever eat eggs and know it could be life. It's an egg; an egg is an egg. You don't eat it while it has a heartbeat duhh.
Am I only the only one who thought of a chick called Albert. Cause he has done this multiple times before
Sorry but no way I believe you 😂 the chances of you swapping those grocery eggs for fertilised ones is far higher than the chance of any of those eggs being fertilised already. This video is a big scam most likely and good job not mentioning the brand cus you probably would of got sued
Surely this ain't real
What an eggcellent video
Class YouTube video Jay
never imagined the egg hatching.. Thats a bust for them markets like the lady said ^^
England's secret weapon jay and his baby birdies
❤❤
"welcome to the world little guy you're from sainsburys"
Currently watching this whilst eating scrambled eggs on toast. Dont know how to feel about it 🤣
You know farmers use certain food and chickens that creates an egg that cant grow into a chick
bruv you are a fkin wizard
interesting
How I’m doing this when I’m older
Unbelievable that they actually tell you to put these eggs in fridges so people like jay can’t do the unthinkable lmao great video
Please tell me you named one Sainsbury’s 😅
be honest though, you took this idea from a brother whos been doing it for years!
This is so sick. Haven’t seen your videos since the old days and I love this kind of video.
Mate this is so sick, I knew I'd enjoy the vid but I'm so invested 😂 huge, huge respect. 🙌
feel hella guilty eating my sticky teriyaki chicken and rice while watching this :(
eggs from supermarkets are not fertilized. stop being dumb chat you're ruining the internet
Probably the best video I’ve ever watched, I was sad when you first changed the concept of your videos but this new concept is absolutely amazing and your gonna do big things in this world I can tell. We will never forget TGF but this is the new era.
I need to see Chloe’s reaction🤣
One of my fav videos you’ve ever done. This is incredible Jay.
that is unbelievable, it just shows how life that is thriving to become something beautiful in this universe🧬☮😊
⚠JAY PLEASE READ!  What did you do with the Frogs and what will you do with the birds?  ⚠
Hatch them then eat them. Infinite protein hack
crazy how you got eggs from supermarket for people to eat but then turn them into living creatures crazyyyyy love your vids :)
The quails are adorable, hope you keep us updated when they start to grow!
Can I have one?
Cool
I’m struggling to understand why he’s so upset about eating an egg that could be a chick….but then have fried chicken for his tea 😂
They aren’t fertile
Honestly jays content is actually the best on YouTube it’s eye opening like honestly jay you need to give your self a pat on the back honestly unreal
best vid on this channel by far
Awhh😭😭
Wait til he learns about beef!!.......
Awwwww
Great work lad this was a tough experiment and this video needs way more views. Love you and TGFBRO FOREVER ❤
3:47-3:56 anyone knows the song? I've heard the violin screech a lot of times but cant remember the name
Just lost a farmer some p good one mate
Sat stoned watching this appreciating the beauty of sainsburys. Beautiful
Huh  That was kind of beautiful
Ok know you have to keep all of them until they’ve fully grown up
Father of Quail army!!! Make a quail army series
i always feel like a boomer commenting on how i feel about the videos but i still do it regardless bro i love the content and its out of left field every time. the lego house and the camper van was all crazy i loved it all keep going and being positive. love and respect ya. scotland guy
True is. Don feel bat about eating eggs as if not scramble eggs than an adult bird is still on menu .
Jay congratulations on being a father
Brilliant video! 👏👏👏👏
If egg prices inflate in Sainsbury's you just made the poorer poorer
Whats the point of creating life when u know u cant take care of them??
❤ I've subscribed. Love what you do X
instead of making vids just for the subs. do some proper research and do things properly. my point is you almost certainly killed around 100 unhatched chicks by not incubating them correctly.
this is sooooooo goood vid
So good to see you still doing what you love Jay, you genuinly bring bits of joy to my life, I'm Bi polar so your energy lights me up bro haha Keep it up Bro.
Totally Brilliant Jay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Glad to see its trending!
the eggs i was just about to cook have gone straight back in the box, always thought they would never hatch, so now i have seen this, its made me question things again. wonder what supermarkets esp sainsbury have to say
This just came up on my YouTube great video you got a new subscriber in me pal
Well done mate
Jay please keep doing what makes you happy and if making videos makes you happy just keep doing it my guy ❤
The King Of Content Cant Be Stopped

Jay man you need to do more vids like these bro it’s so interesting and I absolutely love you vids
Subscribed. There is something about seeing life begin that is absolutely fascinating
Everyday the world just keeps pushing me to stop eating meat! It was such a great Adventure thank you Jay for reminding us that nature is one with humans.❤❤
love this
The ‘zero chance’ has gone out the window 😂😂 Jay you’re living your best life, it’s amazing to watch! Keep up the good work bro 🔥🔥
This is so unique a cool
Quails are fast hatching, the turner should be of at day 15, and every time you move the eggs around you could easy mess it up. But impressing you made it with them. In 6weeks you will get massive amounts of eggs 😂 and roosters fighting bloody.
Great video diffrent to his tgf  great video
If you think this is real, you need help
Those who said “It’s impossible” where SO wrong! This is actually amazing to watch and I hope they all live a happy life 🙏
Never thought I'd nearly cry at a Jay swindler video 😭😂 what a proud father
No way you actually was able to hatch an egg I was so excited when he was recording on your phone
What happened after this? Where does this guy keep nearly 200 quails?! Need updates!!! (amazing vid thanks for posting, want my own quail army now)
My blind ass couldn’t see shit
Unreal video Jay! Love your content😁🫶
Can still be used for breakfast.
My guy builds chocolate water slides, grows chickens and makes beats for a living
she is straight up waffle lol
I work for sainsbury this is hallorouis
Well done, you've created life.  Something we were all brought here to do.
We need tgf back 😢
If i knew about this sooner i wouldnt be spending a fortune on meat
Jay Swingler ,,Just  Woke up and saw this, this   morning pretty amazing loved the video ... I did allso think its was cool  you are a Swingler , me too.. So i had to  Subscribe obviously.. Good Man  i will  Hit the notification button lol .. 🙂😁
Incredible video lad
yoooo i so rarely comment, but what a great piece of content man. you even decided not to tell the viewer in the first half of the video about the fact that you were hatching a shit ton of quails behind the scenes. proof you are not just pumping content and saying everything in the first minute to keep the viewer's retention, but rather giving him a unique experience that unfolds upon watching. great vid man.
As a chicken owner, I can say the next special moment is when you get your first Egg that you can eat. Hope you keep a couple of the girls around. So nice having your own egg source!
Wow just sat down to eat scrambled eggs and clicked on this video😭🤣still ate the eggs🤷🏽‍♂️ Anyway love the video Jay!!!much love from SA🇿🇦❤️
food fraud is a massive industry,, eggs are just 1 example,, 90% of the worlds honey is  counterfeit,, chicken is full of antibiotics, red meat preserved in sulfur, the list goes on
Lend me your incubator, i want some chickens
This shi t is crazy but now it’s making me think If I wanna eat eggs again or feel bad for cracking and sizzling em as I might become a murderer lol…,
Eggs are aborted chicken babies
That also means 2/3 eggs hatched 🥲
this video is extremely misleading  you the eggs you buy can not hack because if how they are made yes some can but they are not the same type of egg
Can you try this with normal eggs jay
Good for you Jay
If this video is honesty real you’ve just made history
Selling any jay? I want a yellow one black stripes ? 🙏
what happened ti the chiks
You are such a unique individual. Never fail to blow my mind
Fake
That's actually amazing bro. I always wanted to do this to find out if it would work
I wanna know what sainsbury got told off for this lol
You gonna give a crack at Chickens next jay?
This is why ur the goat jay
Wow!! Those chicks now are your prize bro, you are now a chicken dad
w video all i need to say bro i miss the tgf  channel too
At least we know what j hutches eggs, in  his three times 😂😂
Well you might as well start selling eggs now.
I’m going out to do this 😂
How is your army 😂
that is one of the most shocking things ever congrats bro  <3
I would've been ringing up zoey instantly to let her know
nobodies talkin about the penis shaped egg yoke 💀
Did this over lock down with Sainsbury’s braddock white duck eggs, we now have three pet ducks!
editing on this video is good icl
This is an amazing video 😂
So my question is yeah what are you going to do with them now ?😊
I reeeeallllly want to know what happens legally now?!
I love that even though tgf is on the shelf Jay just here swinging with the new ideas.
Done this loads. Try the Clarence court duck eggs. Lots of success with them!
Fucking beautiful Jay. It would be interesting to hear the professionals response to you achieving this, made me feel so proud, thankyou for the time, effort and energy you put into your videos💚
And she's getting assassinated
Speechless to be honest
What was Salisburys reaction jay 😂
Jay, this is an unbelievable video  Love seeing new content like this especially from the tgf bro himself
When is TGF coming back?
People will cry when someone eats an egg when a chicken isn't even developed but totaly feel okay with going ahead with an abortion while baby is developed. Great video nevetheless.
Mate Jay you just made history.
Hi jay, this video was probably my favourite by far. You defeated all the odds and most likely ruined a contract on the way lol😂. This was very fascinating aswell, do you think you could try a different species of bird next? Keep reaching for the stars.
man i bet the supplier is going to be happy about this one
This is a dub
They used to sell emu eggs, one lady done the same as you but just with the one. Don’t feel guilty, it takes 18 days for one to be born. Cycle of life. The question is now, what you doing with them all?
This made me tear up! 🥹 what a beautiful video!😍❤
I genuinely hope jay keeps these guys
“Oh my god,two Sainsbury’s eggs, two fookin Sainsbury’s eggs”😂😂
Watching whilst eating eggs😭
Low-key made me cry
You should’ve spent the £40 it would cost to get one from a farmer and see how many you can hatch from £40 worth
amazing!😅
can u hatch humans
This is the most entertaining and creative video and edit i’ve watched in a long time. Thank you Jay
This is the most entertaining and creative video and edit i’ve watched in a long time. Thank you Jay
This is the most entertaining and creative video and edit i’ve watched in a long time. Thank you Jay
first video of jays i’ve watched, i love this content definitely earned yourself a new subscriber!
This is just insane. Id still make quail fried rice with them though.
I loved the video bro, I love all of them but it was interesting to see this!😊
"welcome to the world little guy, ya from sainsburys"
Nah I’m actually so tempted to do this and have my own little army of them
Why don’t u film with romell anymore ?
What happened to the ecosystem? 😅
I’m in TEARS
More of these please!!!!
Hey Jay,  I just wanted to take a moment to express how blown away I was by your video about hatching supermarket eggs! I've been a long-time fan of your content and I have to say, this video really took things to a whole new level.  From the moment I started watching, I was hooked. Your energy and enthusiasm were infectious, and I couldn't help but get caught up in the excitement of the incubation process. The way you broke down the science behind it all was so clear and concise, and I appreciated how you took the time to explain every step of the process in detail.  The challenges you faced along the way only added to the overall experience, and I loved how you shared your struggles and setbacks with your audience. It made the whole thing feel so real and relatable, and I think that's what really sets your content apart from so many others out there. You never shy away from showing the hard work and dedication that goes into your projects, and I think that's so inspiring.  And when you finally succeeded in hatching a supermarket egg, I was completely blown away. It was such an incredible moment, and I could feel the joy and excitement radiating from the screen. I can't even imagine how amazing it must have felt to witness it in person, and I'm so glad you were able to share that experience with your audience.  Your personal experience with the incubation process was also so inspiring. The way you opened up about your thoughts and feelings throughout the journey was so refreshing, and I think it really added a layer of depth and meaning to the video. It's clear that this was more than just a science experiment for you - it was a personal journey of growth and discovery, and I think that really came across in the way you shared your story.  Your creativity and passion for what you do is truly inspiring, and I can't thank you enough for sharing your knowledge and skills with the world. You have such a unique and interesting perspective, and I always look forward to seeing what you'll come up with next.  Keep up the amazing work, Jay. You're a true inspiration and I can't wait to see what you do next!  Sincerely, [Your Name]  P.S. I just wanted to add that your personality and sense of humor really shine through in your videos. I love how you're not afraid to be yourself and have fun with your content. It's so refreshing to see someone be so authentic and genuine, and it really adds to the overall enjoyment of your videos. Thanks again for being such an awesome creator!  P.P.S. I also wanted to say that your video has made me more mindful of the potential for life in every egg I buy. While I'm not ready to go vegan just yet, I do think that this experience has made me more conscious of my food choices and the impact they have on the world around me. So thank you for that as well!  P.P.P.S. I also wanted to add that I think it's so cool how you're not afraid to take on big challenges and push yourself outside of your comfort zone. The fact that you were able to hatch a supermarket egg, which is no easy feat, just goes to show how dedicated and determined you are. I think that's such a valuable lesson for anyone watching your videos - that with hard work and perseverance, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. So thank you for being such a great role model!  P.P.P.P.S. I also wanted to say that I really appreciate how you take the time to engage with your audience and respond to comments. It's so great to see a creator take the time to connect with their fans and I think it really adds to the overall community around your channel. So thank you for being so awesome and for all that you do!
This is actually crazy 👏😂
Episode 8?
w video subbed
We need a follow up video
This was so skibidi
My mum is glued to this video well done jay very good video 👍
Wow mate I have just stumbled across your channel and oh my god what a amazing video I stumbled across keep it up mate 👍
This is crazy, these videos feel like mini films, I love it ❤
Next time you’re meant to lock them down with 3 days to go and take the rotation thing out and lower the temp slightly and boost the hydration to like 70% to improve the chances but tbh you did this with supermarket eggs lol unreal…. lol 😂 defo take the rotation thing off tho so chicks can get into position properly for hatching and when they hatch they don’t catch their feet or get crushed by the rotation x
193/350 x 100 is an equally suprising and alarmingly high percentage of 55%. More than half the eggs that are meant to be unfertilised are. That is wild.
Ok, but where you are going to put 100 of them? I hope you let them live
how is this not public news
really nice video this made my day i have not watched you for a while but im happy i did <3
This is such a creative idea I am absolutely following this series
I did this exactly same video 3 years ago, but with chicken eggs instead of quails 🐤
What an excellent video. Loved it
This kind of content is so nice. keep videos like these coming bro!
Please update us if Sainsbury's cpme for you Jay!!
****This is a nice video butI don't like the idea of a farmer potentially losing his contract and potentially his livelihood from this video
The first two have to be named Jay & Romell surely!
hahahah this is brilliant! I can imagine thousands of kids secretly doing it in their bedroom and all of a sudden the UK is flooded with wild quails
This makes me not want to eat eggs lol.
Did you really get these eggs from the shops I’ll take your word for it but you can tell me the truth if there not lol I thought it was impossible to do that because the eggs weren’t fertilised! Far play to you ether way looks like a rewarding thing to do anyway class video ma man keep all the hard work up iv always enjoyed your vids…
This video was amazing so glad I found the time to watch it! Amazing story, editing, planning and all round entertainment of the vid. Was an incredible vid will defo watch again and recommend it to a friend. Good luck with Sainsbury’s and the farms jay 🤣
w upload 🎉
What you gonna do with them 😂 and I didn't Evan think this was possible well done jay
I love how you couldnt just hatch 2 you had to have 192 😂😂
I love this video and the room vivarium one so much, of course loved the TGF era but I always knew y’all could make amazing content without putting your health/safety in danger. And animal centric videos???? AND they’re packed with information and education!! Absolutely love it
This guy went from  having chickens to raising quail
What a top man, it makes me wanna start a charity, buying supermarket eggs in bulk and hatching them, donating them to farms or giving them as pets
My family did this with 1 free range egg (hens) from 6 various super markets. One out of each packet and they ALL hatched
even if you dont upload as often we can see how much effort you put in. we love every vid you upload Jay. please keep it up
this are the videos i watch you for !  i love your dedication and i was just wondering what you do with 193 quails ??
No why am i crying at the birth of quails 😢the way you go so excited aswell! Congratulations haha
That’s honestly amazing man
Love how your contents matured and grow over the years 😊
Craziest video I’ve watched in a min
your content is so diverse and always incredible
Inspiring!! ❤
Bro start incubating lizards you'll make a new queen of england
Dude made an infinite quaile egg spawner
Lots of people have already done this.
I would love to see an update on this with another talk with the expert and what's gonna happen now. If you informed the supermarket and the detailed consequences. Awsome video tho I loved it.
Vegan much
great vid i subbed
I’m not sure where you got that “professional” but they are not correct 😂
Yo Jay, Great vid - Low key concerned 7:52 with that cable extension, ya trying to burn your house down bruvva xD
Damn this is actually beautiful and making me tear up
Jay! This was unbelievably cool - the editing, production, storytelling alone, and then we have this crazy result too! Wow man. Levels 🌊
arguably the most wholesome video ive ever seen. amazing message, amazing editing, amazing content, amazing work put into the video. perfection
If you whistle they follow! Just a cool thing for you to know :)
My God! That’d amazing man! If I had the means to incubate my own chicken eggs, I’d have an army myself. Idk how anyone isn’t smiling from this video. I haven’t been this happy from your content since the day you bought Roger a car. Keep this kinda content coming bro!   An Army of Quail bruv? WHATDOYOUMEAN??
this is fake but it’s crazy how well you stunt it.
Just ate 10 eggs, this video is not factually correct.
He might still have breakfast
besty videoi kive watched in ages
class video!  but maaaaan how long is it going to take me to forget about this so i can enjoy eggs again
Yo Jay I got an idea for a video for you try find the new crossed chocolate finger in the new diary milk chocolate fingers
😅
instead of eating eggs in the morning you can eat chicken. perfecttt
@sainsburys what you saying??
its like mincraft where you frow like 10 eggs but you only hatch one chicken loll
Smart guy eat eggs for a week or hatch them and get egg n game bird for life 😂😂
That was fucking brilliant! I’m at work doing roll ups for my bar sitting here in aweeee
Eggs ARE much more than food. We don't even need that amount of protein that the medical industry has told us. It's bs that's propping up a massive part of the food industry. And is another reason why so many people in the west are overweight.. they're eating way too much "protein based" foods under the guise of "burning fat and building muscle"
Never could have predicted Jays content over the last couple years. It's been an amazing ride
You know the chicks inside are also absorbing the eggs from the inside they consume whats around them in someway although they are also vegan /vegetarian 😄
The best army ever. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Was it really  from supermarket or did you buy fertilized eggs from a farm or Internet sight?
Your reaction to the heartbeat was priceless 🎉😂🎉🎉
get ready for a lawsuit
Jay brother it’s honestly so fkn cute made me truly cry I’ve been watching you for years since TGF your new content is purely insane the most amazing on YouTube much love from Australia
Omg I’ve been watching Tgf for years on different accounts, I love each and every video and jay on his own makes me a bit sad that Tgf hasn’t uploaded recently but watching them separate has been a happy journey still 😊 keep it up jay
8:25Your from Sainsbury’s funniest shit ever😂
This is why I don't buy eggs I wonder how many fertile eggs we've eaten over the years 🤢
This was so damn wholesome. I am so proud of your newer content and how much time you have invested! There are a lot of powerful messages in these videos too. From doing accent challenges, to jumping in stinging nettles to creating a giant ecosystem wildlife room and hatching Sainsbury's quails...So proud of you dude.
Noo wayy
Looks like we are having chicken for dinner instead
Loads of people have done this long as there free range
This is actually amazing!! After seeing a egg can do that I ain't eating no egg 😂...  you never fail to make amazing content! 😊
I love this type of content, this is what YouTube was made for ❤️ Personaly I have not seen this YouTuber before, but defo up there on the top 3 now 😂 keep up the good work ❤️
You're a legend Jay 🙌
This is absolutely menacing!
So fake because you need the egg needs to be fertilised
you got my sub you earned it
“You’re from Sainsbury’s” 😂😂
I already want an update and a full channel dedicated to these quails
Give us tgf bro back man
Well, if you get fertile eggs from a supplier it's hardly surprising when they hatch.
How tf have i been watching jay for over a decade now
Well done bro! :D
From chocolate milk bath in a trash can to egg army from the grocery store.. Gotta be a legend by now.
Clarence court eggs are done out here 😂😂😂
That was insane
😂😂😂
Jay you are a fucking legend. This content is quality. Ngl i do miss you filling a bin with tea ect lol but this is another side if you thats good to see! Keep it up bro
Bro I clicked on this thinking nah surely it's not possible but holy shit that's class
went from bathing in chilli to hatching quaill eggs
Hell Jay, Im a tractor supply company team leader and I wanted to give you a little advice on potential fore comings as this is the time of year when our company sells baby chicks. You are going to inevitably have some chicks die along the way however they are things you can prevent as they happen, one big one being compaction or pasting up of the  cloaca. This happens when the excrement of the baby birds builds up around the outside of cloaca mixing with dirt and other debris and prevents further excrement from being able to exit their bodies. If you notice that a chick is pasting up underneath its tail feathers, you should gently hold the chick on under warm running water, not hot. As the water begins to soften it you can gently use a finger to rub in a circular motion  in aid of removing the excess debris and stimulating the area around the cloaca enough to remove anything that is fully hardened in the opening. If done correctly the chick should soon after pass a large excrement.
I actually couldn’t believe it worked, congrats on your army!
wow that was an awesome story. im off to Sainsburys.
id love to see Sainsbury's comment on this lol
This video reeks of vegan motive
Omg jay this video is by far one of your best they are so cute , I honestly don’t eat eggs often but now I definitely won’t eat any eggs again
What a vid.
subscribed
great video my faveroute i have watched in a while amazing to see you still making some of the best most unique videos on the platform Jay love it keep it up!!!
You never fail to amaze me jay i appreciate the content!
بقلد ابو الرب
ngl i listened to the first half while cooking a mean omelette, and watched the second half eating it
Breath of fresh air you popping up in the recommended. Great video
quail egg experts is such bs, there is no way chicken farm or quail farm will do to stop egg from hatching. there is no substance or injectable to stop egg from having embryo. putting also the egg in the fridge also extends their lifespan if you can't put it in an incubator yet. the best egg for incubation are 7days from the time they got out of the chicken.. you can put 2 weeks old egg but if they are in the fridge.
You talk about creating life and treat it like something easily disposeable. Didnt even bother to stop rotating the trays over night with live chicks in them where they are easily squashed.  And then you ENCOURAGE the average person to do the same?! Do you know how dumb the average person is? How many burds will now spend their life in living rooms? How many people will not care about them anymore as soon as the cuteness fades just like it happened with you aswell
wtf dont think I can eat another egg ever again
Sainsbury's been awfully quiet since this banger dropped 😂😂😂
I look up to Jay’s dedication!!! Like it’s incredible how careful he is for the chickens and doesn’t let them be with just the two first soldiers hedging😆
Would’ve been hilarious to ring the lady back and show them the army of Quails haha
this is amazing
jay is the king of posting the most random content and i am here for it! it is always so interesting!
Chicken eggs are different there are no cockerels on egg farms for chickens however ducks you’ll probably get 4/6 on average as most duck egg farms have males running with the females to promote egg laying. Good luck Jay
First time seeing a video of you, this is just fucking amazing !
I think its almost poetic how it was the driving video that caused both you and romell to find new paths. Just the fact that it was such a botched video of just driving a shitty car around and having a laugh to such good production like this video. Shows how unexpected life can be. Bad situations tend to be the best things that ever happen to us.
This is actually sick, now i wanna do this, i wonder how much all the equipment and process cost.
Can I have one? 😂 Then the chick can be on our side
https://youtube.com/shorts/JNe0fHfvecs?si=hZ8c5quqAzk_BV7O
i think this is now my favorite tgf video. going from powering a roundabout in a park with a motorbike to making actual life from bloody sainsburys is the best and more wholesome thing ive ever seen in my life. idk if i can face eggs anymore after this 🤣
fairs u did it
wheres tgf bro?
This is amazing, truly amazing !
I wish I could like this video 1mil times
Bro looks like Tyson fury in that thumb nail
Mad that I’m eating scrambled eggs whilst watching this
The Dudley version of Chicken Run
why do u sing/prolong words when you speak? weird accent lol
😂🤣🤣welcome to the world little guy ur from sainsbury😅😅I can't stop laughing😂😆🤣🤣😂😅
why do I have doubts you used eggs from a farm and not sainsburys
These kind of videos are so good.
this is so wholesome bro, love the content
that is insanely cool  hope you can do some more things with the quails too
this is incredible  dude!!
Wow, just wow, what a great video to watch , phenomenal
No way I’m crying man! I’ve been watching tgf for so long and I’ve seen you come a long way jay, I fucking love you bro!
Congrats bro. Proper look like you as well.
yo some some one liked with me
Beautiful ❤️
wow
I’m a male, of course i’m going to try and hatch eggs from the supermarket.
You’ve actually ruined a suppliers contract at Sainsbury’s 🤣🤣🤣 that’s hilarious man
My daughter got given chickens from her skl we had the same experience here, best feeling ever 🎉
Here comes another lawsuit 😂
its dads half bald.
To think this started with you drinking milk and dye. I love your vids jay, TGF don't stop posting videos.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I literally ate 4 eggs watching this video mad
A I watch this im eating my evening eggs. Live in Caambodia and cant imagine if I did this experiment here where they dont check anything lmao.
Lets get this viral
Is it legal?
Hopefully this opens peoples eyes about what happens in the egg industry ♥
Jurassic swingler
That’s is incredible Jay!! Well done! I remember doing this at school years ago!
Name one of the Sainsbury's and another Clarence Court
can you do chicken eggs
Just watched your video omg how amazingly awsum was that so had to subscribe , I’ve watched some of ur videos with my daughter who subscribes to you @izzy lee
Love this! This video has a lot of joy! 😂
Someone show this video to uncle Eddie
Made my day
this is awesome
I was literally eating scrambled eggs while watching this
I live for jays videos quality
6:32 is the best reaction I have ever heard in my life
well if you get one thats fertilized, its just extra protein!
Never thought I would see this video what’s next 😂😂😂
Really thinking  why they don’t want people to make there own Quails
Now tell us what Sainsbury's have said? 😂😂🤝🏻
I love the snippets of her saying “zero “ every time one is born 😂😂😂
I won't be eating or using eggs again, ever 😊
LEGENDARYYYYYYYYY VID!
Its alright people having ago at hatching eggs, but i hope they remember the bird has a whole life span after hatching too.  Too many people 'having a go' then thinking they can off-load the chicks elsewhere is creating a burden. Or should i say bird-en 😅🙄
Well done sir, you have another new subscriber here 🫡
Wow
Great content
First time I've ever watched your channel. Absolutely brilliant
Egg cartel
Jay i beg please keep up these videos you have been making recently, never seen you smile so much bro, such good contents nobody else doing it like you bro
Bro is doing more than the vegans themselves
What an amazing video
The army of quails caught me so off guard! Loved this video! :D
That’s insane I have been watching since 2018 I love tgf I still watch old videos and this video just warmed my heart knowing u saved this baby quail love u jay
this is what vegans should be doing instead protesting
I don't wanna get merked by quails 🤣 but I can't sub more than once, get them subs up guys🤣🤣
seeing you on the verge of tears cause you saw a baby quail is so wholesome
This video is f*king mad bro, love all Ur content though broski
This video is so much bullshit
I really love your unique video ideas and it always brings a smile to my face
This is unreal
You are the reason i started watching youtube at the very beginning ✨ I’ve loved every stage of your youtube story but this has definitely topped it all for me. So ridiculously wholesome and interesting 🥹🥹🥹  This banged!!!
Its always impossible untill its done well done Jay keep up the amazing videos
Well done for your first attempt of hatching eggs, I have hatched eggs all my life but never attempted to hatch supermarket eggs, remember to turn off the auto turn on day 14 that way more will hatch when a broody knows her eggs are hatching she will sit tight and wont move until her eggs are hatched, also make sure you have the pointy end of the egg face down in the tray so you have the air bubble at the top not the bottom, dont forget to remove all bad eggs overwise they will give off a toxic gas that will kill the developing eggs, great video have a great day 👍
Love this!!
Insane bro been watching you and Romell for 10 years this year, always looking forward to each vid❤️
The new content is incredible!! the plant video is what brought me in but this video warmed my heart I think I might have to try this 🥹
I subscribed but not to defeat the quails but to join them in fighting the supermarket greed
NOW DO IT WITH CHICKEN EGGS!!!!!!!!!! 🥲
If you have ever had *farm fresh* eggs then you most likely ate fertilized eggs since they often keep cockerels.
Nice to see you have this humble side of you, me and im sure many more only know u from tgf witch is the complete opposite to this but it is grate to see u making this videos keep going hope u make more like this ❤️❤️
We need a part two of them
mans playing minecraft in real life 😂
Holy! 😮 I'm thankful I've already stopped eating eggs, I thought you maybe get a few to hatch, not roughly half of them?!  Great video!
Man just became a quail farmer😂  Childish chick's😂😂
@achicknamedalbert
The most wholesome content! Im totally here for it. Great video :)
This is one of my favourite videos on YouTube wow
Quail hens lay more eggs when  males Quail are around, Quail eggs or the most likely to be fertile out of all supermarket eggs. no one is getting in trouble for having fertile Quail eggs. Its good to see how excited you get about seeing them moving in thier eggs.
What happened to tgf
This is mad, we need a follow up video where you speak to the companies involved to see what the have to say about it.. please Jay
So I can buy a few eggs hatch them make more eggs hatch them and have infinite eggs for breakfast
this video is beautiful jay
bro is playing palworld irl
Always wanted a quail army….. 😅
Eddie obow is gonna be PISSED
😮

Nah that’s actually sick
this is a beautiful documentary
The army as risin
When are you going turkey to fix that hairline pal :) x
JAY YOU ARE INCREDIBLE.  Honestly it’s incredible to see where your content originated to the content now, and honestly it’s just insane ! Always makes me want to go back and do YouTube , and hopefully get round to it one day ! WE LOVE YOU MATE SERIOUSLY! ❤️
i didn’t watch the video when it first came out cuz i didn’t think u would hatch anything then i realized jay is the type to actually get lucky in these types of scenarios i also realized jay probably wouldn’t of uploaded it if he didn’t hatch at least one, would’ve been cool to get the experts reaction afterwards 😂
this genuinely was fascinating
2:38 bro was speechless 😭
miss TGF so much, but Jay...you'll never fail to put a smile on my face.
Big up the Skyrim music
this was the best thing to see on a sleepless night at 3 am, almost bought an incubator during the video,
whens the next tgf upload?
Please don’t try this at home. Please buy your eggs from a place you can see the hens are healthy and happy or don’t buy them at all. The egg trade is evil. All laying hens are slaughtered after 18 months when they don’t lay an egg a day anymore. They have been bred to lay so often that it gives them serious health issues. Be kind don’t fund the supermarket egg trade 🩷
he never misses
This video was amazing i actually used to work with someone who owns a registered charity looking after chickens full time
Wow, isn't it incredible how something as simple as hatching a quail egg can evoke such a sense of wonder and amazement? I mean, just think about it – the miracle of life unfolding right before our eyes in the most unexpected of places, like a supermarket egg aisle! Jay's video captures not just the act itself, but the sheer joy and excitement that comes with witnessing nature's extraordinary processes.  From the anticipation of watching the egg crack to the tiny quail chick emerging, every moment is filled with a sense of awe and appreciation for the beauty of life. It's a reminder that magic can be found in the most mundane of places if we only take the time to look closely and appreciate the wonders that surround us.  But beyond the sheer spectacle of it all, there's something deeply profound about witnessing the beginning of a new life. It's a reminder of the interconnectedness of all living things and our shared journey on this planet. In a world filled with chaos and uncertainty, moments like these serve as a reminder of the beauty and resilience of life itself.  So here's to Jay Swingler and his supermarket quail egg adventure – may it inspire us all to find joy in the unexpected, to marvel at the miracles of nature, and to never lose sight of the wonder that surrounds us each and every day.  🍻
jay you are my happy place
Ello jay, I never coment on any videos but this one was something different I couldn't resist commenting. Im a huge animal lover and seeing you being able to give life to these chick's that where guna end up being someone breakfast is utterly amazing. Its also a huge shame that the egges we buy from are local shops have the chance to become a living thing and we have no thought about it. Im also integrated to what you are going to do with all your little chick friends.   I don't know what else to rly say but these sort of videos are so much more entertaining and meaningful, there so great ti watch. I carnt wait to see what else you have in store for us, keep up with the great and unique ideas jay you always seem to suprise us with .
Such a mad concept for a video! Loved every minute. ‘Your from sainsburys bro had me in tears’ 💀
Yeah never eating eggs again 😂
That’s amazing  What did the lady have to say about it 😂
Now THIS is content! 😂
Sat eating my tea, watching a grown man create a quail army😂
Sainsbury's Wants to know your location.

Bro this is a W upload icl. Something needs to be done about this also! Subbed and liked. Please do another video on it
If Jay dissappears within the period, we know why
what chair you got mate?
Jay gonna need a lawyer for each chick in court
This is the sort of content that a platform like YouTube should exist for. Transformational, inspiring, uplifting, wholesome stuff that reaches right down to the core of us all - the life that’s inside us.  You’re a genuinely elite creator Jay.
We lit!
Genuinely loved this video ❤
How am I ganna be able to eat my eggs in the morning 😂
All of those eggs remind me of Luke’s head
Why don't they just make 720 mill less
What a captivating video Jay, absolutely amazing work on the video. The excitement seeing a heartbeat for the first time was so wholesome. Never a dull moment on this channel

Pov: Breaking news. YouTuber Jay Swingler gets cancelled by the UK government for hatching eggs out of a shop.  Love you bro vids are hilarious ❤
bro this is gonna destroy supermarkets bro is gonna end up on the news again
This video was fuking sik. I don't remember the last time I watched a video like this. 1000000000000% subed to u. Keep up the work absolute legend. Even the editing is phenomenal, great work editor !!
I was hoping u was going to ring the lady back with your army of chicks
I respect you a lot Jay
Quail man I actually want to own one now 😂
So what happens to the companies now 🤔
Youv lost it mate 😂😂😂😂
Jay, you would need 19100 quails to surpass subs, mad that go from sliding down abandoned escalators to doing this, mad ❤
The 2 big ones shouldve been the commanders
This is amazing love the video
Okay but did Sainsburys message you at all??
I think this is possibly one of my favourite videos ever on YouTube. Your vids are amazing and I’m super keen to see what you continue to do.
What did Sainsbury’s say? 😂
Bro the “your from Sainsbury’s “ made me cry out in laughter
Amazing vid, love it!
I want to see more content of them, make them a childish themed home outside 😅
Do you plan on doing doing something like this again?.this was amazing
This is genuinely a class video. So unique. You're a boss. Keep doing this kinda stuff, please!! Disrupt the system!!
Could you do it with actual chicken eggs ??
What we need to see now is the quail experts reaction to all the hatches😩😂
This has put me off eating eggs! Good job, wonder how many people will try it now 😂
Congratulations on this insane army! We need a Childish Chick army drop!!
so good bro!
i just fell in love… with the chicks 😭
jay i love you
This guy just don't miss!!!!! The absolute YouTube goat 👏 unbelievable stuff man
sick video bro keep us updated bro they are so cute tho
this a truly an absolutly amazing
Thanks for exposing the world of bird keeping to a wider audience Jay! This hobby is often overlooked but it’s so rewarding! ❤🐣
can we pls get an update on gatsby i miss him
It's crazy how this fella used to smash keyboards over his head and sit inside wheelie bins of tea 🤣 loving the content!!!
Every time you drop a video it’s so well thought, the fact you never push any half assed shit is so nice. Been a fan since I was in school and I’m 21 now. Keep at it man ❤
I started watching thinking hes not actually going to be able to do it 😂
You amazing guy just shows u the fast production off food now days 🙌 and u hatched all of them mental bro
love the videos jay just wanna say i love how every video has a meaning like this one ❤
the best youtube video ive seen in weeks awesome jay fair play 👍
This is where I love this kinda thing. The way jay sits there so excited from around 6:30 to 7:03 is amazing. Seeing the way he’s so excited and happy. Seeing how cheery he is and how happy he makes us is amazing! We love you jay and thank you for everything. You (+and romell) the sidemen, Yungblud, 1D and recently AngryGinge have helped me so much mentally! I don’t know whether I would’ve survived ❤ it’s not as bad now but I’m still slowly getting there! I’m 1YR 2MONTHS and 23 days clean of sh! Thank you
So what was the outcome with Sainsburys? Has the supplier lost the contract and you are banned for lyf? :D
Awesome video Jay, that was amazing, the chicks are so sweet. Thank you for saving them. Xxxxx
This is irresponsible, you had to do 300 "army" to make it impressive video to get views and likes. those animals aren't going to get the natural life they deserve and if they go to a sanctuary it's taking up resources for aninals already alive that need it.
You should try hens and ducks! Great video, made me really smile after a long day at work
No way😁 ❤️ love the videos Jay keep them up ❤
This is an amazing video! I hope to see these new friends more! Am slightly concerned about the diet but im sure youve sone your research. Maybe for a next video you could build a mini eco system in a shed or something
That’s amazing man the fact your willing to look after them is amazing
From the research you did, what was the reason Quail eggs were more likely to be successful than chicken eggs? I'm guessing it's because farms have enough chickens to meet demand but curious to know!
Was it actually from Sainsbury’s tho ?
IF HE DOESNT HIT HIS SUBSCRIBER GOAL YOU LOT ARE CHOILDISHHHHH
although this was entertaining, i can’t stop thinking about the contractors who the experts said may lose their job after this. and also good luck dealing with those little guys, they won’t stop laying eggs and new ones hatch. you’ll have half a million of them in a month
An eye opener some times it’s easy to forget things like this life is a precious thing for all creatures on this planet
the description alone proves Jay is the goat what a man
This video got better by the second hahahah Jay never fails to blow everyones minds looooooooool
Omg jay i love you so much and this video is so amazing and interesting! Please post more i have watched every single one of your videos ❤❤
Never eaten an egg in my life and glad I still haven’t !
Awsome video dude. Nice to see another creator doing good with the platform. Keep it up big man.
The comments man, i love you all so much😍
Big love! ❤️❤️❤️
Been done before Zak and jay show
55% success rate is not 0% said the expert lol
What a masterpiece this is
Love the attention to the music and sounds through the video!
Sainsburys and Farmers about to get bent over.
Whens Tgf coming back
This video idea is so cool
8:34 "Welcome to the world little guy, youm from sainsburys" Lmao jays too funny man
WTF JAY I HAD THAT FOR BREAKFAST I FEEL SO BAD NOW
Name them the sales team
jay please upload more g i love it when you upload brudda
From the ambitious ideas, storytelling, cool motion graphics, editing style... Jay never misses when it comes to making sick videos🐐
Hi jay I'm arjun from India and now I am  in Manchester as an international student I just came in January  come and see me
Hi I love your videos and it's mind blowing how you went from chugging milk in a field to this this shows so much hard work and dedication I especially liked your transforming your room video with the frogs and stuff and I would love to see similar content in tye future👍🤜🤛
Cant believe that people are surprised that some animals comes in eggs. what a world
Fucking epic, well done sir
IT'S A MADNESS!!!! TF-E-G-G BRO
I love your creativity Jay , keep doing what you’re doing love it brother.
That egg looks sus
It’s insane that you can hatch eggs from Sainsbury’s I love it I want to do it myself
No waay 😂 , ima do the same thing and try.
Welcome to the world little guy, your from Sainsbury’s-jay 2024😂😂
As someone who is just days away from their second child this felt so wholesome and happy and really hit closer to home than I thought ❤❤
Mate fucking brilliant video
Yo jay I felt sick to day and when I watched this video I felt so much better I love your videos man keep it up 🎉🎉🎉
Very bad form to do this publicly. You've probably lost those people their contract with Sainsbury's, supermarkets can be absolute cnnts over this kind of thing.  Fertilised eggs are more nutritious than unfertilised, so you've just taken a higher quality food off the shelf.
that is crazy
You are insane, that's why i love watching your videos 💙
hats off, you fu@ki¬g legend!
Can see Sainsbury's do a rebrand "Grow your own Quail". Good job, hopefully you rehome them or keep them? Will need an update at some point! Thanks for the video.
5 minutes left and I’ve been sat smiling throughout the whole video. Thank you for creating this masterpiece jay ❤
do it with an ostrich egg next
The quailmaggedon is upon us
This is the best
your insane bro love the vids brother
This is mad, happy to see jay enthusiastic and passionate about something so wholesome
no albert shoutout
me: awww sick, two baby quails   jay: two????????????????
For real this may be the best video I’ve seen on this platform. So many creators these days have massive sets and crazy reactions but I can tell Jay was genuinely buzzing to show us this and that makes it sooooo much better
You won't be able to do this with a chicken egg though
Great video this wow. I never like videos but this I had to
I always wondered why I could hear some duck’s making sounds when I drove past your house in Telford 😅😅
This challenge was over easy
can you eat quails?
Imagine if Sainsburys committed on this video though 😂
Im glad the quails are at a sanctuary brilliant stuff
This is actually incredible, your content is so unique and enjoyable to watch! Keep doing you man!
Have you kept them as pets. Wow just amazing
I have been watching your videos for a solid 6 years and it is unbelievable how much you and your content has changed, never stop being you Jay. You are a massive inspiration and I am sure if you actually became a father you would be brilliant. Keep up the good work my man
this is incredible
Na this guy man 😂
Honestly Jay this is a surreal video.
Jay is the GOAT for content
You know it’s a banger when YouTube comment on your video!👀😳 Congrats Jay and keep it up bro your vids are probably some of the best on youtube every time you upload i genuinely get gassed to watch them, its so dead scrolling through your recommended and the algorithm is absolute dog shite, but when i see you’ve uploaded i always know the videos gonna slap!💪🏽💯 Love bro ❤️
Amazing truly 😂😂😂
i love the fact his local shop is also my local shop
This absolutely amazing well done jay
wow so over half of them were fertilised eggs thats mad
W video
This is actually incredible Jay. From watching your TGF videos to here is insane. Cannot believe you actually managed to hatch 193 quail eggs. What on earth. This video was brilliant
Jay your sick af man! Absolute legend!
193 easter egg... 19/3 new childish drop?
does anyone know what keyboard he uses? 5:20
This Is Brilliant I bet you'll be banned from sainsburys for life now 😂😂😂
Jay your gay
Clutter can lead to increased depression, but some times the clutter comes from a serious heart break that causes depression, i lost my mother when i was 21, i just worked, went home, slept and went to work, and the clutter grew and i just gave up with it and just carried on as a null of a person, then i had someone(i owe my life to them) pulled me from that, lifted me and helped me back to me. I cant thank them enough, jay what you have done is undescribable. More than hats off my dude. Im going to remix your new video about the quails eggs, because im going to do a similar video and release it sunday. Hit me up can we facetime, im going to do the same(not trying to one up you at all) but a little bit more that involves the local schools my children go to and the surrounding schools. Appreciate you big swingler. Jacko
bros dad lore is gonna be crazy
New subscriber 👍🐣🐤
This was so amazing to watch! Jay, you are a legend! You should be proud of yourself!
Insane!
unbelievable jay! congrats on being a father to an army of quails 🤣
cant belive it happened though congrats jay
Cant lie eggs are mega but no idea if im eating one again 😂
i miss old tgf...
The question now is...What are you going to do with all these quails?
wicked tha
Still making me laugh 10 years later I appreciate you bro 💙
Pls jay play dark souls 🙏
we love you jaydogggggg
Love it Jay keep up the good work
pls keep posting ur awesome bro

This was mad! I definitely learned something from it 😂😭❤
YOU’RE A MUMMY NOW 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Someone tag Eddie Abbew.
I love the editing in this video man it's so creative
Keep it up man great videos! ❤
imagine when they all grow up ahahah
Easiest subscribe!
You can hatch Morrisons duck eggs I’ve done it 3 times successfully even on the bbc
You may add to the army Jay, according to Social Blade you got a total of 170k Subscribers sunce this video dropped lol
Waiting for Sainsbury’s response 🧍‍♂️
you shoulda reported back to the woman at the end of the vid
The editing and storytelling makes it feel like a tv show but still feels like jay
So.. just asking. Did you get someone out of their contract?
Jay always upping the levels🙌 from swallowing sausages to making life
It’s scientifically impossible to hatch chicks from the supermarket as they are unfertilised, this is a fake video. Eggs in the supermarket come directly from female eggs that haven’t been exposed to male sperm, therefore they would never hatch. Chicken/qual farms would never put fertilised eggs into a ‘batch of eggs’ in the supermarket as fertilised eggs sell for more money + can become a real chicken and be added to their assets. This is a fake video
Just know that thousands of people are now going to try this😂😂
jay is such a sick guy love these vids every post ❤😂
Any word from Sainsbury's????
I just ate 3 eggs before whatching this
haw wour chin duin.
Jay this is fucking amazing! Seeing that life you almost like, created, is so so cool🥰🥰
Your content varies between "hilariously random" and "tearjerkingly beautiful" in a way that no other channel does
i cannot let quail babys defeat me in battle!! i have been a long time subscriber.... too battleeeeeeeeeeeeee
WOW. JUST WOW JAY. Incredible video!
amazing video jay as always
Bloody hell i cant fight the army 😭 im an old subscriber 🤣
"Welcome to the world little guy.... Youre from Sainsbury's" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jay you should try this now with chicken eggs
Congratulations 🎉🎉 chick daddy now 😅absolutely loved your video , its quite emotional in a great way watching new life spring into this world 😊
i wan tto know what the lady at the start thought of you hatching all the quale's  😂
Love it
this is epic.i went all cold when you see the heartbeat.you sir are a legend.
Bruh I might do this
Love the vids man keep it up you’re doing amazing work ❤
The most random yet most wholesome of content. Another banger.
This. Is. Content.  Why did i get the feeling you thoroughly enjoyed this ?  And it shows.
Jay mate your a geezer, this was amazing.
I want to see Sainburys reaction XD
Showed it to my mom (she doesn’t watch any Youtube) and she was glued to the screen, this means you completed Youtube
Banger Jay. Loved this, will show the vid to my missus too. so wholesome
Gassed to see you enjoy making different type of video bro 🤝 we’re here for it
love the content bro❤❤ Class video ❤❤❤
This is amazing, I ain’t a vegan but I don’t think I can have a egg again yet I’ll scran a steak happily. Insane how this worked 193 times out of 350, I’m so happy you did this
Jay this is actually insane what you pulled off. And seeing that joy and happiness in your eyes when you saw life in the first egg genuinely made me so happy. What you are capable of pulling off with determination and dedication is out of this world. (Let's hope they let you in Sainsburys after this tho)
Begging for likes and subs. None original content. You have changed man. 👎
Jay, I really liked at the end of the video where you went on about how you wouldn’t go on a vegan rant and actually explained how eggs are a good source of vitamins and protein but how this is what you can do with just some eggs. Really amazing video bro. ❤
You are so fucking wholesome nowadays bro. Such a positive content creator on YouTube, it's amazing to see the growth over the years. The ideas you've been bringing in recent months are great!
My girlfriend is obsessed with chickens right now & she really a pet chicken.  I think we might have to try this method!   I am absolutely shocked that you were even managed to get one to hatch.  Loved the video.
Mans officially shadow banned from Sainsbury’s 🤣
Wow nice video can we have follow up video about Sainsbury's and what happened are they mad could you get banned from there 😅 could this make the news or they to busy with war stuff man i miss the old channel i miss the ghost videos i like more and you could send them to nukes top 5 that be fun go to the most haunted house in America what you can rent for the night keep up the crazy videos man 😊
Legendddddd! Icon! but I can no longer eat eggs🤣🤣
I remember josh Pieters actually doing this a few years back

Screamer

That’s literally the best video I’ve watched in a long time

Well I bought two quails male and female the female is laying well
Get in there Jay.!! Love to see more of these shinanigans!
What was Zoey's reaction?
Have been watching since the early days and I’m happy that you’re able to do something that makes you this excited.
Insane Never knew this was possible. Fair play
Thumbnail appreciation comment!  Great video too😭
What a video! Will there be a follow up of the fall out from Sainsbury’s and the egg company??? Let’s hope so. Great content.
Sainsbury’s lawsuit inbound
Jay u never fail to amaze me brother
How cool is that hahah
You’re one good egg say jwingler, always makes me laugh your videos. Keep up this good content mate, love from down under🫡🙌🏻
Sainsburys are pissed 😂😂😂😂
Dude, love your videos, You're so good at this, every time you upload a new video, it never fails to entertain and inspire me!😂 Keep doing what you're doing, it's dope!
You're a good egg
This is so sweet, your excitement when the eggs hatched. Bless your kind soul jay ❤
Jay, your passion for video making and telling stories is so inspiring. I've been watching for years now, and I've never been let down by a video you've made. Your content shifts, and I never know what to expect besides the guarantee that you're going to put hard work and passion into whatever it is you're creating. It's so admirable to see you be so open and transparent about your mental health, like during the road trip, but you still manage to have a good time and push the power of positivity. It's tough to put into words how grateful I am for your hard work and dedication to just being yourself. You're leading by example that doing what you're passionate about and working hard at it can make you successful.   Oh, and you can swallow a hot dog better than anyone I've ever seen. I've gone back and watched that video every couple of months since it was first uploaded and cry laughing every time. Nothing is funnier than seeing one of them disappear then come flying back out again.   Thanks for all of the hard work and care you put into every video. It is so much appreciated I'm positive you can't comprehend the mark that your great attitude and positive energy leave on everyone who watches any of your videos or TGF videos. You guys both are absolute legends. Thanks again!
Sainsbury disliked this video
Please do this with some ostrich eggs
Jay, sainsburys sell ostrich eggs.
Jay is the mother of the eggs cheep, cheep, cheep
Nice video jay keep it up
Tbh this video is a banger it’s simple no mr beast style shit it’s original. I would of loved to adopt a quail ngl
Name it Quai Swingler
Maddd! We need a bigger army of quails now
Bro this video is insane I had to rewatch it like 2 or 3 times 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Go on then swingler, il give it a like
This video bought a smile to my face, Love everything you do keep it up ❤🧡
This makes me so happy. You saved some lives, Jay. 2 little babies adorable. I need to try this myself and always wanted to do this
i’ve seen this done a fair few times on YT but nobody can do a video like you Jay!! top content as always bro!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So it's just facts that British people waste food
What a ledgend
That’s such a good thumbnail wow
Fkn love u jay x
Wait you play warzone? 😄😄
It’s so nice to see Jay looking truly happy and fulfilled now
Legendary video man
This was one of your best videos for sure, absolutely loved it
Tbh I expected maybe one chick to hatch but not over a 100 it's gonna be weird eating eggs now and my question is, is it the same with normal eggs too ?
Can't wait for the next crazy adventure Jay takes us on 😂
Now you got quail meat
CHUNKY PARAGRAPH
Bro don let MI6 get u bruh
well done mate
I love this so much. I cried.
Welcome to the world little guy your from Sainsbury’s”😂😂😂😂jay bro never change man  Edit: what the fuck this guys been incubating 300 eggs. Top legend😯
Please call the first born Sainsbury’s 😂😂😂 you always come through with the funny yet interesting videos you getting gassed over the eggs and the symphony music in the background your a legend man
This is actually outrageous, wow your brain works in crazy ways and in all for it!
I'd like to know what your expert had to say and what Sainsburys have to say.
Sainsbury's lawsuit pending....😂😂😂
Amazing video brother u are tge g.o.a.t. vid would of ended so much better if you had shown us that lady's face after hatching the 2 sainsbury eggs
I'm not sure you actually hacked a super market egg. I feel like those 300 eggs you got were already fertile eggs and you just switch a couple into the Amazon one once you realized none of them were going to make it at all. So you could save your video idea and the time you already had invested. Seems highly probable that you did that.
Mate, could you link the thing you was using to look at the egg at 5:11
If this is true, this company really does need to be reported. This isn't supposed to be possible
I always knew Jay was the best dude. And idk but this video just proves it to me
where did you get the extra 300 hun eggs
If vegans had their way dogs would starve to death
🎉
unreal jay hahahahah
i have no idea how this has happened but its fucken sick! now time to grow some cows from steak
I want to di this with duck eggs 😍😍
so freaking wholesome, love the evolution of Jay 🙏🏽
This is genuinely so heart warming tbh, Fair play
One of the best pieces of content I've ever seen from Jay, seeing that literal army at the end was genuinely emotional
Thankyou for carrying out a childhood dream of mine x192!!😂 i truly love your content more and more every time i watch, we love you jay
unreal.
Vegans will love this video😂
Watf bro this video was amazing, no joke bro over the past few years i havnt had the best time like alot of people, but everytime you upload it never fails to make my day! Me and my friends have a camping youtube channel and were inspired from you to just get out there and do it,I cant thankyou enough for giving us the inspiration and motivation to go for it The channel is called," Idiots camping" if you want to check it out(we"re the young lads) all love man love your videos❤
I would love to be in a video with jay man it be like a dream
At first I was amazed and it was absolutely beautiful. And then it rapidly became more and more epic, it’s 3:21am right now and I just woke my girlfriend up to tell her “Jay Swingler has just hatched quails from Sainsburys” with so much excitement. Her reply was are you unwell it’s gone 3 in the morning and you’re waking me up for that. I’ve now left her as she didn’t match my excitement or disbelief, I tried to explain the whole process but she was having none of it. I ended up sleeping on the sofa. But Oh well.. 🎵 I’d rather have a dark fruits than a wife 🎵 fucking love your enthusiasm at everything you do. I think recently your content has became so much more and it’s brillaint to see. Keep it up man love it brother.
Haha nice one
jay not even jokign when i say this but this vid was actually so entertaining and interesting and some of the camera shots at the start were sick!
As I mature so does my favorite content creator
I absolutely love this video seeing jays face light up made my day tbh
Jay this is actually amazing x
ABOLSUTE BANGER OF A VIDEO
This video is the most heartwarming thing you’ve ever done and I haven’t been able to stop crying or smiling. This was the best thing I’ve seen for a while. Thank you for doing this!
I just had a miscarriage on the 17th, this video oddly brought me a sense of peace and calmness. Thank you.
My man made a supermarket rage respect
Can’t believe I got teary eyed towards the end lmao. Nonetheless this was a great video and props to you Jay for making it work out! Wish you and the quails the best! 🎉
Reminds me of   https://youtube.com/@AChickCalledAlbert?si=Y2-7dD7jpjFAKa3B 😄
Just wanted to let u know at day 16 theres a thing called lock down and thats when u disconnect the thing that rotates the eggs if anything u made it just a but tuffer but it’s all good
I'm going to be honest I really miss the TGF videos. But I do really enjoy your content on your normal page because it's so real and honest. Your travel series was emotional to watch, and I'm so glad you vloged it. I also think TGF should do a video with the Sidemen & and Mr. Beast all in one. Can't wait to see what you have next in mind 🔥🔥❤️
Icl maybe a little vegan rant wouldn’t have been bad, I’m not vegan but this video kinda proves how immoral it is :(
This video feels so wholesome! I was just thinking about how your videos have developed thru the years. From you and Romell putting yourselves thru crazy pain to a literal baby bird army😂
Unbelievable, Clarence Court are quaking right now 🤣🤣
you have actually somehow made me buy a full set of this whats in your description and im going to try this someone around the corner sells fresh eggs and im gonna try this hopefully it goes well :))))))))))
wtf you gonna do with that many chicks hahahahahah
Bro went from cementing his head in a bloody microwave to doing this 🤣… always love watching your vids and the amazing content you’ve produced for us the past god knows how long 🙏 big up bro  absolute banger as always 👊🏼
Jay is a beast and just dont give a fuck but we want more vida brother you help and touch so many people ❤
i’m genuinely at a loss for words with this one, jay…. wow.  this brought me so much joy and peace watching. unreal content! i can’t stress enough how amazing and original your type of content is. i’m all for it, keep that shit up🐣
Will we ever get TGF back?
Hands down the most creative creator in the UK. Your content is unmatched I appreciate the effort you put in, keep it coming
reminded me of your old chicken u took on a date in the park and sang photograph by nickelback to :)
You're from Sainsbury's made me laugh
Banging video Jay! We need more content like this on YouTube
Man that's wholesome
I had a quail of a time watching this.
Not even lying i’ve never been so hyped over an egg hatching that is class 😂
I was never a fan of eggs growing up because of the smell so never tried one. One day I rember very well probably 15 20 years ago mom opend a egg box at home and there was a dead bird no feathers no eyes didn't even look like a beek lay inside a broken egg since that day I will not eat them or anything made with them and tell people that like them.
Amazing video jay. Would love to know what Sainsbury's had to say? ❤️
That's wicked👍
Amazing Video as always Jay
Nahhh Jay you’ve fucking smashing it with this one. Unreal 👏👏
dont let the quail army beat us
This was a very good video.
Cap
Only at 8 mins in and this video is crazy I love how jay has completely changed his channel for the better of his health and not physically going through pain for views😂much love been watching tgf years since keyboard slaps😂😂😂
Bro fell off big time
Bro said, "Welcome to the world little guy, you're from Sainsbury's" LMAO na I'm dead
Why not😂
2 seconds in to this its Jay Swingler I know full well this is the best video imma watch this week.
Shrewsbury sainsbury bro are you yoking 😂
This is insanely awesome 👌 💪💪
love this
I can’t believe this is the same guy who got his head stuck in a microwave
I can never guess what your gonna be up to next i love it. Always something new going on
Omg 😢😢 absolutely loved this video Jay ❤
Ur the goat another banging video
we need longer videos jay
also we need a house tour jay
I would have subbed for this video, but I already am, so I will share this video to family and friends who will sub.
its not somebody's breakfast without incubating there is no life
That’s pretty cool
cold
I think everyone’s gonna start buying quail eggs now 😂
Not fertilised so its impossible
"Welcome to the world little guy from sainsburys" sounds like he's from another planet 😂😂😂
Im rewatching this with my two boys 😍👏🏼
This is such a sick video lol, i kinda wanted you to keep the first two, but it’s alright i guess. Sick you can actually do this lol. Would you not feel sad for the particular farmer that just lost his license though?
atleast give max fosh the credit
if you want to grow chicken then guy from a farm a free range farm
Bro this video is boss
2017 jay swindler would have bathed in 300 eggs not hatched them
Sainsbury's punching air rn
You saving these almost guaranteed dead birds has made my day. It’s a warm moment. Thank you.
Awesome!
The evolution of your content NEEDS to be studied! This is the type of content we need on this platform. Instead of these challenges that have been milked for however many years, you're taking it a step further and doing these crazy experiments that just seem impossible!! Big respects to you for changing up your content and doing something I rarely see on YouTube. Amazing video Jay 👏👏
WOW. Amazing video Jay. This has got to be one of the most wholesome videos from you, and I love it!
That is mental, Sainsbury’s about to ban you 😂
best video i have seen for years
Finally 😊
This was fucking amazing first YouTube video I actually sat down and watched to the end. Amazing bro
Jay Swingler the scientist🧬
WOOW! Just woow! you are amazing Jay! I'm so glad you're doing this! That you show that it is life that we eat every day, and how beautiful these animals are! This is by far the best video in 2024! You are so dedicated in what you are doing and your such a nice and amazing person, don't let anyone stop you from doing what you do and what you like to do! Big love from me! :D
When you announced the ARMY then showed the empty room and cutting to the terrarium room just positioning the camera in the extact spot! Those little details matter and the furnature popping into the room after that, editing is amazing you should be proud of yourself man.
Thanks for this jem Jay
Great vid sainsburys wont be happy 😂
Had eggs for breakfast, RIP tasty boy💔
Jay you should open farm where there no killing them😂😂
This is why absolutely LOVE watching your videos jay, they never fail to entertain me, they always keep me interested and intrigued, i'd like to say from the bottom of my heart thank you, for always creating such interesting and entertaining content. not to mention you created life, those baby chicks are the cutest creatures i think i've ever seen, i don't know if you're ever gonna see this comment, but i hope you do and realise of just how much a simple 15 minute video can do. love you jay and hope your doing well
The dedication that goes into Jays content is unreal. Definitely one of, if not, the best content creators the uk has.
This has been done so many times, nothing happens to anyone
This is honestly amazing geddon jay 😂 only you would do this side quest
This is insane the amount of progress he puts into these videos is unreal. It just shows how much effort he puts in. Keep it up jay💙
I fucking love you man 😆👌🏻
I’m so happy you’re still doing videos I’m 21 now and I grew up watching you and Romel. Please never stop I understand real life takes it’s own role in these videos but I’m genuinely so happy your still doing this. If you read this I love you bro <3
Syndicate Original x Childish drop when?
We can tell you upped the editing here. It paid off big time. Amazing video.
Amazing videos bro I know you hate Americans but that isn’t stoping the support
Oh my god this is amazing
This was so precious to watch made me shed a tear was such a relief this made me burst out crying jay you are one of a kind
One of the greatest YouTuber fr
Brillaint
Wow, just wow
One of the greatest videos I’ve ever watched egg sales after this video better go to the mud
Eggs are bird periods
What are you gonna do with all the quails when they grow up? We need updates please!
Yo Jay you might not see this but this is such a sick video thank god for YouTube’s loop feature I’ve had it on repeat for an hour now very amazing video man I can’t wait for the next videos ❤️
This actually made me smile! The fact these little babies could have been eaten for breakfast but now are gonna live a long and happy life just makes my soul so so happy 🥺❤   Great video Jay, I loved it!
My guy doing bits for the world post TGF! 🎉 respect!
the super markets are coming for you💀
You are the only guy that can do this 😂
This is why Jay is becoming the PEAK of YouTube Content Creators 😊
I'll keep it 💯 Jay, I watch all your vids coz I'm a fan and it's what we do lol, but I started this video with little enthusiasm or interest in it and by the time the eggs were put in the incubator I was all in and it turned out to be a great watch evoking genuine emotion. Like a short film, taking me on a journey fair play this needs to go viral.
Jay, I have been hatching eggs for years from quail, chicken, and duck eggs. Sometimes providers add male chickens to speed egg production so you may get a fertilised egg, the best chance for success is with quail eggs as the females love to pair up, and that also speeds up production. It's amazing when life comes out the egg and you see it 30 days later 😆
Bro I was cheering so loud with you haha that’s amazing man, shout them quails man
Sainsbury’s are fully in the mud 😂
Nah man I ain’t ever ginna be able to eat eggs again
funny video keep it up jay all respect yes lad ❤❤❤
😂❤
Jay great video lad i actually enjoy every video of yours and they actually give me good entertainment. I can see how much you put into your videos and i thank you for putting your whole life just to entertain us. Carry on doing Gods work Jay. 🫶🏻
I loved this bro. I'd like to see a few more videos about the birds development etc
Never stop making videos. You're awesome. I'm here for all of it!
10:44 bro that is crazy man! so wild what a great video man you're the most unique youtuber I've ever watched man love it. Found you during the microwave cement days lol love from Detroit man, keep it up bro!
Never wanna buy eggs from a supermarket again 😂
Jay don’t make me cry man
What a video mate there’s levels to this game
Jay is the only guy I know, that is willing to put down a grand on proving his theory, now that is dedication to content and I f**king love it! I actually felt like the grinch feeling for the first time after seeing how excited he got when he noticed the heart beat 😂
Does un-subbing then subbing count?
Bro, this is the most wholesome n amazing video I’ve ever seen! How amazing! Congrats Bro💙
Love how you done this video, saved so many chicks so gonna be having farm then ?
This has got to be a series. So creative!
Wow Jay never seen anything like this on YouTube before. They said it’s impossible to hatch a Sainsbury’s quail egg but you managed to do it. What a legend well done Jay bro. I wonder what your gonna do with them all when they grow 🤜🤛
Oh my god mate I’m done with eggs now….
A hatch rate of 33.3% is crazy
JAY IS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE VIDS
Hi Jay 👋🏼
Sub, well earned 😊
great vid
Quite an impressive video there, fully enjoyed it! The quail chicks were so cute. 😊😊 Glad there elsewhere safe and sound but im quite impressed how it fully worked 🙈
I don't think I'll ever be able to have an egg again
Eggselent video g 😂
Sainsburys has left the chat
Definitely never eating eggs again. Cheers jay mate
Love the content 🫶🏻
193 out of 350 eggs!   that's really alot  !
now to get the 2 big guys doing tricks😂
amazing hahah
Bro love it . U don’t find much people doing content like you bro please keep going my bro god bless u 🔛🔝
Holy shit that’s actually awesome jay saved a chicken 🐓 from getting eaten that’s dope man 🤜
This video  is so wholesome. I wish I could have pet quails but my cats would sadly consume them!  Another banger of a video Jay.
I won't name the company I work for. But we sold him 6 viable eggs 😅. Not sure where our eggs come into play but yeah 😂. Lies
What did quail woman say after
JAY this is CRAZY !!!! WOW
JAY this is CRAZY !!!! WOW
Absolutely madness Jay. Loving the way your newer content is heading, from your pranks to actually working hard and trying something new from traveling abroad, creating  a computer game, redecorating a fans room to hatching store brought quail eggs. Keep up the good work you Absolute mad lad.
This video has made me want to do this myself
everytime he takes the egg out to look at it , I really just want to rush him to put it back in!
This could have been a unique marketing campaign for your childish chicken drop….nevermind lol
Great video Jay mate hope your new pets are settling in well 😁 also you’d gone to the Sainsburys that I work at how mad is that 😂🤯🤗👍🏼👍🏼
Yeah jay this is it mate found it again
It's all good doing this for entertainment but you genuinely need a massive pat on the back for this. Deeping it you've gone out your way and spent literally weeks at giving 193 animals a chance a life 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 proud of you jay
This  is my local Sainsbury’s so better work
Bruddddda this is sick I love these vids omggg so glad you haven’t disappeared
JaaaaAAAAAeeeeey!
bro i wanna do this so much XD they look so adorable good job jay honestly
Jay the quall dad 2024
day 18 this happened: ad starts playing with someone cracking open a egg
@jayswingler your the man😂😂😂
i never wanna eat eggs again, this is so sweet jay :)
Bro you seriously make some of the best content on the platform. Ever since u got more consistent it’s been all uphill. Sky’s the limit mate
This was insanely wholesome. Loved every single bit of it. Jay, the type of guy that is going to make farming cool again just by introducing people to the notion of 'Supermarkets are not going to be happy if you hatch their eggs' 😂😂
i want to see the experts response to this
how do i double sub
I thought this was very well known. For people in The Netherlands, Albert Heijn used to be very known for doing this with theirs.
Kinda sounding like Alabama rn jay
Mate I'm not guna lie but this is something that I always wondered wether it could actually be done from store bought eggs... I have heard of people hatching eggs that they've bought , but that was completey coincidence. But you've actually proved it in numerous ways. Especially against the big chains. So thank you. You're a top man! ❤️
Mental mate, honestly. I don't know how you managed this!
I dont know why but I love this side of jay🙏
Absolute w from the man Jay Swingler
i am literally eating egg for breakfast and click this video 😂😂😂😂😂
My word this is incredible. Well done man!
watching this whilse baked was the best desision ive made this week
I love this … well done jay, this is the kinda stuff I watch and the fact that one of my fave YouTubers is doing this it’s mad… I’m getting a bludy incubator now
We have u not done a vid for 1mouth
So with an incubator you can 6x your protein x
Love the content and the effort bro ❤
Bro became a chicken scientist for a video and I love it ❤
I’ve subscribed this was fun to watch no i’m not a vegan but loved your humor. I just wished you went to the supermarket and told them at their hq what’s poppin with the eggs in the vid
Jays had it the mother , everyones going to go veggie now haha
Expected Jay to link Sainsbury’s quail eggs on the more info - time has matured him.
Jay you are absolutely insane! It went from the weird prank videos 4-5 years (maybe longer) ago to this. WHAT DO YOU MEAN!!! Love you jay, keep up the amazing work! my inspiration ❤️❤️
This is actually mad! I was convinced this was clickbait
F#@king love how jays channel has developed over the years 👌
“Welcome to the world little lad, you’re from Sainsbury’s” That was funny
It's Videos like these where Jay Inspires me to be a creator. He's creative, doesn't just follow trends, he's determined, and he works hard. Not to mention Jay brings emotion to his videos and creates a connection like no other. I really feel like Jay is a premium creator creating top notch content.
It blows my fucking mind how much your content has changed over the years, the insane gut busting laughter from TGF was great at the time, but I'm much more invested in your more recent content here. The transition from fucking around with sandpaper waterslides to hatching supermarket eggs & Helping a young fan after his father passed. You're a good one, Jay.
Absolutely Incredible ☺️ Hands down the Best f YouTube video ever!! I wish I could have held one 🥺
*goes to hatch quails*
Absolutely amazing. You are just brilliant x
I have never clicked on a video quicker
Bro seeing life really makes you think about what ur eating yk.
I kinda wanna try and get some quails now
Goat 👌 ordering a incubator to do it with the kids
That is so cute. I will buy some quails off of u jay
Cheers jay, having a omlette tomorrow for breaky
Hahahah love his mind me who sites there thinking let’s make a chicken 🤣
Unreal scene from swiggy big up
Unlimited chicken xp farm?
Did you tell the expert what you achieved? And if you didnt please do and record the reaction
I’m gonna go buy a rump steak from Tesco give it cpr and see if I can create a cow. I’ll come back to you if it works 🤞🏻
Jay is a father 🪺
how does bro come up with these ideas 🔥
Jay you always do things that people dont think of doing 😂 love your content always bro
Will TGF come back
Reminds me of fly away home the movie the little girl grows chick's in her drawer without her parents knowing then flys with them
Amazing content
What did the quail expert have to say about this then 😂
You should have shown them to the women who said it wasn’t possible at the end
I'd have to keep them man, they're his babies now😂
so wholesome mate 🥲
Man you don’t understand how much i miss TGF i understand it had to come to a end one day but man i sure do miss youse too 😢❤
Literally thrown a box today 🙄  you read my mind after I did what I said I did 🙃
Interesting but most supermarket eggs are not fertile since most eggs from the supermarket are you shouldn't from a big farm factory full of just hens not Cockerell therefore I think the video is partly fake
Amazing work jay
Is the first bird boy or girl
Honestly I love these style videos jay. I’ve been here since 2016 (or 17 I honestly can’t remember these days haha), and seeing you transfer your content so drastically, yet so well is nothing short of inspiring. I appreciate the time and energy that goes into these videos so much, and most importantly of all I appreciate you jay for always being there to deliver. Much love man!
I got an idea you might like: Make a Dream Tree House. I believe a lot of us would enjoy seeing you build the greatest dream Tree house we have ever seen!
Im the egg that he pulled out the bin. I didn't hatch unfortunately.
Glad to see u back bro 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
now we wait for the sainsburys backlash video
Bros  gunna get a lawsuit
This is actually mad! These types of videos fascinate me, instead of crap like real life tinder bs. I actually learnt something from Jays video. Thank you mate for sharing this experience.
You asked for feedback from your videos so here’s some words that’ll make you happy. I’m so happy that you’ve decided to change your style of videos to stuff like this. I think it’s awesome and love your uploads. This video I especailly enjoyed. Wholesome and educational. Please keep uploading like this. You don’t realise how many smiles you put on people’s faces with videos like these. Keep up the insanely good work bro
I love jay swingler
Jay this is incredible and so interesting, thank you
You guys funny as ya videos always crease me up
This is absolutely impossible to do in the US. All our eggs are refrigerated at the market. And I’m not sure they sell quail eggs at Walmart. Haha. I don’t eat eggs anyway, I’m allergic. However I wouldn’t eat them after this anyway. Way to go! This was fun and educational. ❤
Jay is the most random guy uno when it comes to videos😂😂😂
Need Eddie Abbews reaction 🤣
This is one of the best videos I’ve watched in a long time, I love your content please keep uploading these kind of videos Jay! Hope you’re doing well 😊
Yoooo jay made life made fucking life out of it that's crazy nice one bro been watching you since tgf started like the earliest video I remember is boys vs girls chilli challenge so thanks for all the content love every single video you do and man please keep then around I wanna see them grow up
I love these videos so much. Everything he does, it makes me want to do it myself cause he makes it look so cool like the ice bath, the ecosystem, this etc. please keep up the sick videos like this man 👊
First we had helldivers 2 with democracy and NOW JAY DOING DEMOCRACY TO Sainsbury's 🫡🫡🫡 Well Done LAD!!!
This may well be the best and most fwd thinking creative video I've seen jay, keep thinking outside the box your mind holds no bounds l, keep going we need you, 👍👍🙏👍👍
Fxckin' amazing Jay, that was thoroughly a joy to watch, keep up the brilliant content! 🫶
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥👑🐐
Love your vids so much I appreciate the production value and just the interesting themes.. just goated
Jay: " i decided to hatch 350 quails" // ME: F*CK OFF NO WAY XD
Such a good video, love it!!!!
Most underrated YouTuber
their little wings are so cute
omg dude i miss the old vids but still do you keep surprising me man hahaha keep rolling this content!!
Nah jay gotta say ur iq for video or just things to do is baffling i absolutely love it actually loved this video and ngl thought was fake till I seen 2 nd 1 hatch was amazing love u jay any one reading this stay blessed 🫶❤️
I’m doing this!!!!!!!
u checked see if some r male or female / hen or cock ?
Just to confirm the 300 eggs were from sainsburys? If so that's actually shocking.
I love how we have grown up with you and have the opportunity to be shown that nothing’s impossible, Even though that isn’t the aim of the video it’s still published through it, i hope to see  you succeeding in more content like this and showing us that we aren’t limited to certain roles in life, we can explore!
Asif 😂😂
Gone from - the blendin of children, swag.. to now tryina save a quail
So they weren't normal day to day eggs then lol they were proper fertilized eggs
By far one of my favourite videos 😂
Bro you are a legend gonna do this myself big respect to you jay laaaa ❤
Holy f**k, this had me seriously invested from the start haha. Then when the first egg hatched I got a little emotional too. This is absolute madness, some serious effort from you to make this vid. Nice to see you back, and although this is very different from most of your content, I absolutely LOVED this! ❤
"Welcome from the world, from sainsburrys" 😂
what did you do with your ecosystem room?
Waited 2 months for this bs ffs Jay.... you're better than this.
Jay you are an incredible human being
jay is so entertaining lmao
Wow Jay ur so awesome and creative and it always shows and pays off in ur videos!! Keep going ur doing amazing i always look forward to all ur videos ❤
I know you hatched all of them but are you going to keep them or if not what are you going to do with them
Bro this is so random but so dope at the same time lmao
“welcome to the world little guy, you’re from sainsbury’s”
Bro's hatching my cousins 💀💀
I like the documentary style videos
These videos are incredible man
Bro . . .  YES. . .
Would love to see Zoeys reaction 😂
Off ya head,and we love it 😂😂
Wow this video is Crazy Love it!
Unreal video! The storyline, the wholesomeness, the everything! ❤
seeing the shots of the heartbeats and the movements was like a scene from a nolan film man
Guarantee this makes it the news tmoz
Another unexpectedly wholesome video love this kind of stuff
What’s the chances I made a sausage and egg sandwich to then walk upstairs and YouTube suggested to watch this vid , cracked me up bro feel really bad now I just demolished an egg
Sorry to break everyone’s fun but store bought eggs cant hatch 😂 they aren’t fertile hints why they sell those eggs and not incubate them yourself . We live on a farm I can promise you this is how it works 😅❤ sorry Jay brother i still love you tho ❤
As if😂😂😂
Dead vid
thanks for this peice of shit i cant beleive u hatched them chicks thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You my friend, are absolutely brilliant. This is a madness.
Jay bro are you tryna turn us vegan
Love the determination jay, definitely made me rethink a lot 💙
“ Welcome to the world little guy you’re from Sainsbury” 😭😭
Love the whole idea of an army of them!! Also the camt3 Angeles in this vid, especially the one in the chickens little house
Hatch an ostrich
This idea is banging ing
Legend ❤️
This guy just keeps on growing so strong. I love your videos
I dont think I'm gonna eat eggs anymore ngl
This is some wholesome content right here, made my smile from ear to ear when they all started tumbling out of the incubator, big love Jay, your videos are always a joy to watch ❤
not gonna lie this really touched my heart because a couple of years ago I found a baby pigeon egg and me and my family took care of it, my dad even built a huge cage for it outside in our back garden, after letting it out of its cage multiple times one day it never came back and it went back to the wild (we called it ava)
Goated vid Goated youtuber all love
imma try that at home they are so cute
The only thing this video missed was a follow up call with the expert. Her reaction would have been jokes. Amazing vid as akways bro
right im off to Sainsburys
Love you jay, not only this was sick but bro one thing you'd love is called Geodes opening, try looking and that and how sick of a video it could be, the stuff you need for it is not cheap but the experience makes it all worth it.
This guys content is always 10/10
Ok but why quail eggs? Can you try it with actually chicken eggs because I’m not put off enough from food store eggs yet haha 😂😂😂❤
Hope the supplier didn’t lose the contract that’s a farmer/family  potentially losing their livelihood. We need food, we need farmers!
ones called sainsburys others called tu if there’s another its argos 😂 ong there i got to that bit 😂 mate they could fill the whole of sainsburys up
bruv. i've been watching u and romell for years now. fell in love with ur energy, charisma and even way of speaking (i'm not a native eng speaker, and the british accent stole my heart mostly because of u). At first, the silly tgf videos that gave me tons of laughs. Some people say the ideas for dem old videos were bad, but that's not the point. In their simplicity, they were beautiful, because what we were actually watching, was you and romell creating a friendship with ur viewers. You didn't need flashy cars to give away, or loads on money to spend just to be liked and admired. U, by just being yourself (sometimes overexaggerated version of urself ofc xd), built this weirdly strong connection with fans. I think it would fully explain the riots at hide & seek games. So, i been watching all of the old videos purely to spend this time with you and laugh like a motherfucker, thank you for that guys from the bottom of my heart. Now, that your and romell's ways parted out a bit, I sometimes watch romell's street fashion vids to look for inspiration, cuz he a fresh looking fella, but what you, Jay, are doing rn on youtube, is simply remarkable. ur series on driving through Europe, stargazing, renovating the dude's room in his absence and many more - pure content. Not only it's enjoyable to watch from technical point of view - ur montage and videomaking abilities, but also your witty thoughts and emotional baggage that you share with us all. It's all damn beautiful, and i love to see u grow from the silly kiddo on first videos to an aware, warm individual like rn. keep it up brudda, i love watching ur videos, and i hope we gon see future projects from u and romell together, since it would bring even more potent memories. much love
Dude, this video is beautiful ❤️
he’s a mother 😂
This was beautiful to watch 😢❤
Blowes my mind how the police can still hate you, especially after this vid Much love❤❤
Who even puts eggs in the fridge 😂dont need to
Oh my goodness. It really makes you think about eating eggs again!  I've always wanted to try this... Now I might give it a go! Loved this video ❤
i wonder if this would work with chicken eggs. i would imagine not
Naaa what a video Jay always producing quality and banger vids,keep up the banger vids fr 🤝👍✅💯luv from Ireland 🇮🇪
Loved it brother, absolutely loved it 😄💙🙏
Love the content Jay
Great video jay, really enjoyed this one, keep them coming!
Your mind has always been an enigmatic turnt machine
I have never been more proud of you Jay. Keep up the good work lad.
Videos like this make me feel so excited to become a father, I absolutely love this videos jay please continue them lots of love ❤
mate this could really highlight issues with the way they sell eggs to the supermarkets they obviously sneak in loads of fertilised eggs and the supermarkets probably turn a blind eye too. I bet your gonna annoy some people (Clarence Court and Sainbury's mainly) with this one but great video mate!
I've hatched chicken, duck and quail eggs (all from supermarkets) in the last 4 years. If you are very lucky, you can get 2 hatch from a pack of 6 eggs. Sometimes you need to incubate them for a little bit longer as some eggs are not freshly laid. I love hatching eggs in my incubator and hand rearing birds. Birds are awesome
Jay where have the Christmas calendar vids gone
I knew it wasnt gunna end with the Amazon incubator… then when he said 300.. I was thinking that’s the Jay we all know and love 😂😂💪🏽
Love you so much jay this video is the reason your a beautiful human
Bro I'm actually so happy for him  And I love your videos there so deep and so funny
You know exactly what that means …..  nuggets !!!
amazing video
You are a legend jay !!!
This video is wholesome and inspiring
better not go vegan
Throw some steak in da incubator and make a cow next
Hey Jay you probably might not be reading this but I wanna say thank you for making me (and all of us) laugh for all these years now! You probably read stuff like this a lot but let me tell you, last month Pauly Parker from DWMC sadly passed away and I cannot expres how bad I felt. A guy that saved me from dark times and gave me an excape from reality was gone. You are just like he was for me. So let me at least say thank you ❤
How is the hair transplant going? (Genuine question)
All that protein.
Nah I’m calling bs. Notice how at the end he only showed a couple of them hatching. And when they came out of the incubator they are all dry and conveniently all at the bottom by the door😂
This Is so insane an i love it. Love from Australia to you in the uk man all respect i love this type of video you should keep doing this same format i love it an i think its not just me who loves it
wow honestly i've always thought this but you're so incredibly smart and every one of your videos are amazing and thought provoking, so proud you're also from birmingham (or closeby)
fucken incredible
I love this, me and my family did the exact same thing over lockdown with ducks and we hatched one and called it Jim. Now the back of the garden is all duck pens and we have 4 varieties haha. We did also try quails and had 10 but they all mysteriously disappeared from their pen in the garden. Brilliant video 👍
Such a good video but the only downside i found of this was i wanted him to do another video call with the lady at the start and show her what was accoplished.
What a insane video, Jay your a mad man for doing this
Jay is officially now mother f**King Jesus!!!
This is amazing 🥹😭 thank you so much for saving these babies 🤍
Officially put off eggs for life now
Dude this is absolutely Insane. There must be no better feeling at a successful video than creating life.  This must mean some farmer has been purposely selling eggs from males to probably increase their numbers/profits.
Fucking love this jay what a great video love this content from you wholesome and funny more if this man ❤
19:00
Jay killed it , this vid is awesome who tf would’ve thought id be so excited to see an egg hatch lol
Amazing fucking video❤️🤝 great job as always🤝❤️
Was there any update on sainsburys or the supplier this is insane makes me want to try now 😅
I work in the poultry business and seeing jay do this is amazing as also sad
Absolute banger of a video, so different and I loved it you smashed it jay
i love ur vids bro, keep up the amazing work. king✊👑
More of the videos please jay. so entertaining!!!!!
Such a good video🙏🏼 really hope the farmer doesn’t lose his contract though, No farmers no food!
Changes perspective on life 100%! 🤩
THIS IS CONTENT
This was brilliant, Welcome to fatherhood ❤
This video has to be one of the most thought out videos i have watched in a longgggg time on this platform! Amazing camera angles, story, editing video timing ! Honestly everything is perfect about this video in forms of structure
You are now blacklisted from Sainsbury’s
Have Sainsbury’s come after you yet? 😅
It’s giving Max Fosh and I’m here for it 😂🤔
reminds me of a chick called albert
Flippin love how emotional you got over these babies 🥰 I've wanted to do this too! I have 4 cats though, prob best not to.
The vids just keep getting better and better. I really liked your explanation at the end of the video about why make this video. Honestly this content recently is really cool can’t wait for more.
Done
Your the top YouTuber jay love your vids ❤️
Congratulations u legend u will be a great dad
im lucas
Dude this is so cute
Sainsbury’s in the comment section ah crap ah crap ah crap
Jay I’ve said it before I’ll say it again you’re one of a kind bro, just when I thought the vid was coming to an end after the two guys hatched you’ve upgraded to a huge incubator 🤣 your vids are always so random yet so engaging an feel like it’s always things we’ve all considered but aren’t able to do 😂 don’t ever change bro you’re the best
Jay you really make my day so much better watching this inspired me so much and shows there is much more to the world then we all think there is I have so much stuff going on (dad has just gone prison ect) and I really needed something like this to make me feel better thank you so much ❤
bro its a infinite food glitch
Quality video, I’ve watched you years, it’s great to see you doing what you do best, entertaining 👍 keep it up lad.
Please don't copy Jay.
Can we get Sainsbury’s response to this ?😂
❤
No way Jay created life. My guys doing next level videos 🔥🔥🔥
I love what jay is doing , that "tgf" feeling is still there and i love it ❤
felt like shit today watched this now i fel 5% less like shit thanks ?
Like if you think the chicks are adorable
Jay swingler just causally being god and creating life
I love jays videos, he puts effort and time in, and it makes me smile watching him being creative, and he is funny, I do miss TGF but jay is making some really good content and I really appreciate the time he takes, keep up the great work jay
Jays content differs so much more from the average crap you see. I don’t know any other content creators who make videos that have such raw class in so many varied ways from start to finish. He shows incredible character, determination, and enthusiasm to give us content that isn’t only interesting, but also informative. That’s something that as an audience, we should cherish
Bro is now ops with Sainsburys
This was so unexpectedly wholesome. Fu*k sainsburys!
Jay I'm not sure if I should call you mad or something right. But god damn this video is interesting and well done mate.
i was literally thinking about if this was possible an hour ago and you make a video on it haha lifes a simulation man
I work at that Sainsbury’s😭
All the dislikes on this video are probably just the Sainsbury employees 💀💀
This is amazing Jay omg. I truly didn’t believe this would work
No way this video was sick man i love watching your vids jay like there always so amazing
Let’s beat the Quail army and get 19,300 new subs🫡
I saw your instagram post about this being a huge video and you didn't disappoint brother! Love the videos
Bro got a heart of gold
Tamagotchi in 2024 is mental!
That is so incredible🫣👍👍
Hey jay, just wanna thank you, I’ve been struggling with anxiety a lot the past 7 months and your videos have been really helpful especially jimmys journal camping vids as it was a marker that I’d made it through a week and I had that to remind me. You really are an amazing man bro ❤
nice
You need to make updates with these chickens, this video was too good!
Thank you so much, now I can go and flip my over cooked steak I cook with the bottom of my left hip.
This is similar to the max fosh fish video
This is one of the best, maddest videos I've ever watched Mr Jay
From sainsbrys what accent
Thank god Jay Swingler is on YouTube, I’m so thankful 🙏🏼♥️
No farmers no food!
This video is amazing.  Love it Jay! Peace from germany ❤❤❤
This is amazing! Wow
Dude I usta watch you for a couple of years things have been happening in my life then I forgot about you.ive recently started watching ur old videos like hounted houses or forest those videos are awsome.also im curious wat happend to ur black friend
life is beautiful
This is truly a masterpiece. To see how much jay has changed over the years is amazing. I mean the man went from cementing his head in a microwave to hatching a quail in an amazon incubator. He is genuinely an amazing creator. He has improved and matured so much. I'm sure if he ever becomes a father he will do absolutely amazing. Absolutely epic watch. Good job jay !!!!!  Also imaging jay being a dad. He is just gonna have hundreds of stories about him and uncle rommel 😂😂 that kid will think his dad is cool af
@jayswingler hello mate your vids are so good I have been watching all your stuff for years now and it always makes me laugh… this vid is just crazy and now I have already ordered myself a incubator and I’m going to give this ago . Thanks for making your good videos can’t wait to see the next one !!!!!
I am 100% running to the store and trying this out! If it works out promise ill make a video about this and name a chick to you! Also did you keep the first two?
Keep up the good videos and the hard work you put in m8
I love this.. had faith since I clicked the video
story telling was so good in this video, make a movie bro
Gay Swinger
Jay is a chicken god. If you remember that reference then you r a OG. 😊
This geezer yeh, hatched an £8 yoked egg from Sainsbury's, if this doesn't get the attention it deserves, I don't know what will
❤❤ great video
Is this the beginning of Jay's farming arc?
This is such a good video!
Absolutely insane content bro i love these type of videos so much. Especially when i eat:))
I remember subscribing to TGFbro when you were at around 130,000 subscribers and I’ve been constantly amazed ever since at how you manage to innovate with your videos. You’ve always had my upmost respect.   THIS video though, I think is the most awe-inspiring thing I’ve ever seen on this platform. It reminded me how incredible nature is and the overall sanctity of life. Thank you for sharing this Jay.
The man who walked a chicken Actually birthed a chicken. Absolutely legendary
Holy shit jay does the most random but creative vids, this was a banger though 👍
This guy just lost a farmer his contract his lively hood probably a lot more as well 😂😂 YAYYY THE TGF ARMY MADE A FAMILY LOSE EVERYTHING
Haha nice
No they're super excited you'rr there, if you were the first thing they saw after hatching, as bird imprint so they literally think you're their mum.
Hands down top 3 videos you’ve made keep up the amazing work you legend 🫡🫡
This is crazy!! Love your videos mate! Long time follower and fan! Hope to meet you 1 day mate! Legend 😁😁🙌🏼🙌🏼
this might be your best video
Eggcellent video 🥚🐣🐤
Baby birds and usually just animals in general imprint on the first like alive thing they see, 10:05 , they probably think your their mom lmao
Broo this is mad!!
What do you mean
I gave this a like. Which i rarely do.  From a proud meat eater.
We know eggs make chickens bro what's the point
okay but we are gonna need an update from sainsburys and the egg company
J did he show the chicken expert how many chickens came out and if you did what whas her reaction
this gave me goosebumps, what a great video!❤️ they are bloody cute 😩😩 kinda made me never want to eat eggs again i can’t lie, i had goosebumps everywhere
Fully enjoyed that, what a mad idea and it worked 😂 blew my mind man

I didn’t shred a tear
OMD they are so cute! i loved this so much! Id really love to see more videos from you of experiments and tests like this. Keep it up its amazing <3

That was the best plot twist I’ve seen in a while😂
Who other than Jay Swingler hears of a 0.01% chance and proceeds to defy the odds and hatch 193 of them!!
Here within a hour 🎉🎉❤❤
o  m  g <333
The king has uploaded! 🙏🙌
Next time you walk in sainsbury the security guard will be escorting you straight out 😂

I fucking love Jay’s channel his content is unique
Can’t believe I’m interested in this but we NEED a part 2

You always be making my day Jay
You do you jay! Still having an egg butty in the morning hehe
Loved this one 👏 big up for the effort thats gone into it too!
What an amazing video concept 😂 first video I’ve watched all weekend that I’ve just had to sit and watch without anything else going on. Love it
Why is this making me kinda emotional tf?
You should stream warzone I think personally just an idea if you have time
Goated vid bro
goat
Start populating the local parks soon
Jay your the man do you think you could do it with normal eggs free range ??
This video is beautiful
Jay is the only real YouTube that doesn’t fake things, i love you bro, keep on going ❤
Top Job chap 🤘
Loving this content Jay you can really tell you put your all into these videos and I hope you know we appreciate you man
Jay back with another banger🔥🔥 great video👌🏽
Incredible video jay loved this keep it up brother
my man swinglaaaaa creating life now, I get there'll always be the 'I miss tgf' people and that's ok, you're not wrong for that, that's just what you like, but the classics are still there, this type of content is new, and I love that Jay and Romell are both finding new niches and new things to explore, that feel like we're there with them, I love them showing us what there is in the world, this type of thing is truly mindblowing, well done Jimbo, this video was incredible!
Best thing I've watched in ages, can't believe it worked, missed u posting jay🙌
I used your wood on black wall idea for my set up
f*ck yeah thats sick you should try it with lidl eggs see what abomination could hatch from them
ofcourse this is jays next project lmao
love the content man your channel has been a journey
Wow your energy and passion for this is amazing your videos all ways brings me a smile and keep going
thing like this prove to me how important local farms are. we need well looked after animals that live full lives before we eat them. im not vegan. but im against the inhumane tight cramped cadges and poor conditions these poor animals can go through in the mass production plants
You have to call them Jay and Rommel... you really do have a soppy side, dont you. lol
I’ve watched jay grow from an annoying child into a father. I’m so proud
too bad you can't give some of the quails away to your subscribers 😂❤
I'm waiting for the "Sainsbury's sued me" video😂
"Miracle" Is the most fitting name for this little hero. Absolutely banger video, your production...YO ANOTHER HATCHED!? That's mad...Anyway your production is getting better and better man, always raising the bar.
Bro i fricking love this video jayson
Zoey: "Someone named a pig after me once"  Jay:                     *DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T  LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH DON'T LAUGH*
So jay is basically in creative mode with a spawn egg
Brooo naaah. Literaly I have no words for this fckn video fam. My heart melted while I was watching the video. It's like a journey in the TFG industry, like a children being born. Such a good video m8❤❤❤
this video is absolutely amazing, i’ve been a long time watcher of your videos and seeing how far you have come is great 🐣
Hi jay
This is actually insane!!! Wow. Can’t actually believe it tbh haha. Makes me wanna give this a go! Imagine selling all these quails too. Huge profit lol
Miss TGF 😢
Watched this with my vegan gf, never getting to eat eggs again 😂😂
Wow J you're amazing buddy so cool
This is insane, absolutely love it though Jay! The work and effort this must of taken, allowing 190 odd new lives to be on this earth. On their behalf, thank you Mr Jay Swingler! We appreciate it. Honestly Jay, very impressive.
jay never fails to blow me away wow
Banging video bro, keep up the good work my bro. ❤
Does this make you jesus bro? or god or some sh*t??.. f**k it all hale Jesus Swingler
😂😂😂😂
Me n Ashton have just watched this amazing video, so educational for him now we want to do it ❤
I was so in denial at first but oh my got best thing I’ve seen all week😢
This is the same man that suction cupped himself to the roof of a bus for a free ride
Man said his army
Wow man I bet this must’ve been such a good feeling W video man love it
good unique vid jay
I love you jay
Im curious, what do you do with the little chicks, do you take them to a farm or something or do you keep them?

That is so cool
Jay, the egg dad 🥚

EGGCELLENT🐣
Sainsbury’s wondering where all the quail eggs are going
Jay swingler lad I absolutely love your videos your one of the only YouTubers that you can tell actually have there heart in it no matter what goes on, I miss the series where you done the Europe road trip that was one of my favourite series on YouTube keep it up lad
Actually amazing video man, do fancy some egg on toast though i wont lie.
Jay is the only type of guy to talk to a chicken expert😂
That was amazing.  I love tiny things, and seeing your overwhelming joy & surprise when the first two hatched.  It just made me so excited to see the rest of the video.  And then seeing a 100 + more of them be born.  Utter insanity.  Awesome work & amazing vid!
Come a long way from TGF well done brother!!!!
thats me put off eggs
I can't cop it anymore. Unsubscribed.
I wish he called the lady back and showed her all the eggs he hatched
What a video! 👏🏼 loved it Jay!
crazyyyy, much love man
It’s amazing to think that he made life from a supermarket egg man such an interesting video loved it keep it up x
This is the most incredible video jay , In awe at how you gave them life 🖤 so beautiful  ❤️
The quails are now at an animal sanctuary where they’re able to live long happy lives together rather than being slaughtered for dog food by the way ❤
Bro you come up with the craziest ideas and turn them into a banger videos..! I love it!
Lawyer on speed dial.
what is he going to do with 193 quail eggs that have hatched now??
your ideas for videos are sometimes strange but still mange to entertain and make me smile everyday me and my brother have been watching your videos since day 1 and we always miss you posting ur videos and especially with romell! Keep it up jay we all love you!❤️
Why did I tear up when I saw the lil baby 🥹 awhhh
Just because somebody sounds like they know what they are talking about, doesn’t mean they do. It’s important to recognize this because many people are trying to rip you off. That woman is a grifter and a liar. Its clear is you take time to look at the way they act. Please do not give these people publicity. Ffs.
You're an absolute living legend Jay! Keep it going.
the return of the Chicken God, 2018 donnys know wassup
"Someone named a pig after me once " 😂
this was so sweet
Jay like this
we need update videos
This was soo entertaining, also on a serious note very controversial but good video raised awareness almost, also put me off of eggs and maybe rightfully so especially because of the corruption
The way he gets so excited about it is so cute
LETS ALL DO THIS TO BRING DOWN THE BIG MAN
This is genuinely one of the best videos I’ve watched in ages. This guy is so creative when it comes to his video ideas unreal bro keep smashing it ❤
whats he gonna do with the chickens now then ? lol
This was amazing jay in all the years I’ve watched you this is by far your best vid ever mate 🔥
I am about to counter jay’s army with my own quails
Bro this is up there with the Gameboy video in quality. You never disappoint us Jay.
That army plot twist caught me off guard Jesus. Love the determination whenever you set your sights on doing something 🫡🫡
its always a crazy thing to me that someone just has a random thought and boom chickens. good shit man keep em coming 👍
Vids seriously too short i could just watch an hours worth right now it's been that long lol great vid jay
Please find them a good home after this... Experiment...
This is actually insanity, every minute got crazier 😂
Congratulations on becoming a dad Jay! 🥰🤣 litterally had tears of joy seeing them!! 😅 loved this video!
Pretty sure birds will imprint on whoever they first see, not sure if the same with quails but if thats the case, its probably why they run to you when they see you, youre their mama😂
Amazing video! already a subscriber have been since the beginning! I wanna say god bless you Jesus loves you so much jay!
Your ideas always amaze me
Every like I get I will buy a chicken and call them jay
