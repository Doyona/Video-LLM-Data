Wasteman
Jdjs
Ahh cuz are u a crip👤👤 or jus chip🧐
I love chip he’s so genuine
“If somethings comfortable put the whole planet in it” chip took his ego out of it and looked at it with a different stance, I rate it. My ego definitely got the better of me on this tracky every time I see It I’m like ffs typical insta pic tracky but he’s right, if it’s comfy fuck it why not.
Half of these looks so bad these man just love designer
Cs up? lool
A swear it was northface
Chip isn't about it
What’s he copping with, his overdraft? My guy ain’t done a show or dropped a decent song in years
Get fredo on this
Stop Inviting all these brokés it’s getting boring to hear .. this and that price .
I enjoyed your interview with Chip 💘
Lv this guy.marry me mr
Chips jumpers is proper like the design just simple and calm
God be with us
Shell hoodie hahahahahaha
That's girly that Crystals in a jacket
Showed him trash moncler and yeezeys when he calls them trash stop acting as if he is saying the whole brand  is trash
Vetements have not put out ONE good piece ever
This guy performed at my primary school 8+ years ago...
Wow , I can't believe chippy trashed the KAWs ... thats cold , 🥶
pretty sure thats the crip gang sign fp
I got a Shell bag
Keep buying depreciating overpriced rubbish and wonder why your culture stays poor. At least then you can blame white people.
Is he even drinking anything
I want that Shell hoody lol
The devil wears Prada
https://youtu.be/j4hwGcwLHXI
Man said put the whole planet in it 🤣🤣
That moncler jacket is crazy wdym its trash jus cause he ain't got money to style it he gone say its trash HAHAHA
Chip wears drip but he still waste man
Pradas dead cant even lie.
5 years ago my mate went to the woodford tesco express at 12pm and Chip was doing his shopping xD
those kaws were 160/190 rrp, resell is high coz they are so limited/rare. Kaws is serious, if u don't know, get to know
H&M been putting zips on their bottoms as leg adjustables since forever.
Jefe! #jefeclo
Goat 🐐 👑
Dumb cats don't miaow miaow miaow! What a dumb sallow ding bat. I don't like dumb CATs. I like cats, just not a dumb cat. Miaowww!!!
HOW DID HE F U K WITH BUGZ
Get iLL BLU on here
we need mist on here
I love how chip always act like he from the 1950s
Rate chip. He ain't ever running out of bars. Good honest review
“Raah man the carpet is thick innit”🤣
What make jumper ?
Whatever hes sipping has him amped
This one here is forbidden lol....he has a way with words.
Could have a million in the bank, would never spend 20 racks on a coat
Chipmunk 🐿 pop star this guy
You can see Chip is still humble looking at prices seeing certain things are a bit mad and extra 👏🏿
Why does chip look like butter wouldn’t melt with all his cute facial expressions and then he just turns into a beast when you put a mic in his hand 🤣🤣
Dont know whats more annoying, the laugh, or the slurping every 3 minutes.  So fake.
Man watched this past midnight when I got work early and the full video cos of Chip!
When he drinks it sounds like he’s giving uck
dumb material shit
Yo I still have chips album I AM CHIPMUNK from way back, bought it as a kid haha. Good to see him back in action
Chip talks some sense here.. I also like the interview you guys did with snap capone..   I get that brands become hot.. it used to be for few years.. now it seems it's a season, 2 if they're lucky.. but if you define yourself simply by having spent 10k on a certain designer, just to have few random youtubers tell  you when it's no longer hot, in their opinion, and then you cant no longer wear it for fear of being labelled a man in last years hot labels.. oh gosh, I feel sorry for you.. that's like being in chains to others opinions. All the high end designers put out nice pieces.. I recently went dior.. was gonna grab the new hightop B27's  (Airforce style ones) but when i held em/tried em, they felt so cheap n flimsy.. I went LV and got a pair their instead..  much more comfortable & better made, which is important to me.. give  a fuck what some random clown says about what's hot.. i buy what i like.. if it's a nice looking piece then it's a nice piece. Fashion should be allowed to be individual.. create your look, keep it current, but your look.. fuck being a sheep. Done
Chip gets them fake monclear stuff real talk braaap
That hurt to watch man trash a Grail trainer 🤣... those Kaws are a top 10 ever released IMO
Get little torment on this. Realest in da game !
He went from Jahmaal to Chipmunk to Chip to Chippy 🔥 🔥 🔥
Is there a link or address for the actual shop?
The realest trend or trash I’ve seen
Artist need to teach their fans about investments not garms and watches. More to life then clothes and cars.... I respect chips honesty on clothes prices
It’s a KAWS X Jordans collaboration, the value happens because it was a limited pair, that has been part of KAWS ethic when he works on something. Think originally they were worth $350, it’s more of a collection item.
His laugh is so infectious
WHOS KAWS LMFAO

Yeah contact Shell, you small man.
11:30  *It looks North Face to me too*
Get ghetts on this
Chip has always looked stupid
People don't know when it comes to designer...they are literally worse quality than primark material.  Its the name and designers you're paying for. They won't last any longer after a few washes 😁
Chip has money but still cares about quality. Now thats a smaaart man
Sorry but a rapper who doesn't actually know of kaws equates to somebody who knows fuck all about Streetwear. That's like chanting thug life whilst sat with his mum in her kitchen.
He looks older
Can't lie chip lost a lil of my respect trashing them kaws shoes, didn't even know who he was 😭
Chip came from underground made main stream hype n still stayed in his roots   I remember his beef backaday with buggyzy now look theve smashed a banger together
We need fredo still
He needs to get his teeth fixed as he keeps hiding his mouth so he is self conscious about it. I think there is nothing wrong with his teeth or smile but he clearly does.
People need to realise chip is a real lyrical genius, he’s an artist.
I’ll never forget chipmunk got 4 Bs and 5 As on his GCSE results, back then he was a 16 year old kid who had lit up the legendary Tim Westwood show with Wiley and Ice Kid. He was transitioning from a pirate radio MC who was recording songs in DJ ironiks bedroom into a nationwide young star and topping myspace hits. There were times when he would not sleep before school because he was on big stages performing the night before but he’d go into school and stay focused the very next morning. He is academic and naturally intelligent, he was always above his years, and whether you like or dislike him as an artist, you have to credit him as a person. He holds himself in high caliber and can articulate well amongst the most prestigious members of society
a full grown man still talking like that.....what a penis............. 'innit'
What a muppet
Sometimes I wish I was living in London just to say innit and bruv 😔😔
Kick game is such a sick store, spent a lot of time in the one in Burlington arcade after it opened, they got some grails
I didn’t know any of the f the brands he just mentioned. lol
someone tell the guests the resale cost is from kickgame, kaws 4's were £200 ish rrp, had chip thinking its 2k retail kmt
Bruh what the FUCK is this, whats kaws? kaws is a brand? this is some dogshit review lol
So sad every black rapper promotes all these designer brands for free.Slave to brand names.Put your name on something and promote that instead of these historically racist brands that ain't giving you nothing.
20 k on a coat is silly my gosh
Big up chip man og in dis ting
Cmon🤘🏻
Hard
Chips album was better than fredo's no cap
Yeah rate chip hes a personality on top of being one of the best rappers to come out of Britain
Do skepta next
Should've askd him about Zanottis with the black leather and gold zippers they're fire for around 500 GBP.
Chips a tosser end of
Is this chipmunk? Whys he covering his mouth while he talks?
lets see more black men in suits rather than casual wear, casual wear doesn't get most people into the real business world.................
We need fredo
This guys not as wavey as he thinks
Vetements are looking to catch a case for plagiarism with that jacket 😂
I like the way he talks
Salute   30 year old Chip
Wouldn’t wear any of it haha it’s all shit
Who is Kaws? Come on now son
That was proper thorough analysis really appreciate this
Moncler have teamed up with stone island
I get what you're saying pal
Still still ztikk
Get what am sayin innit this guy chatting to much shit
Big up chip for being smart with money 💯
he don't know laws im dead
Get Tion Wayne On This
Chips a humble  guy
Highly rate chip as an artist. But he really needs to drop the road man vibe. 👎🏻
Amiri clothes comfortable: £1500 for a sweatshop sweater lol
Who cares?
Kanye doesn't design yeezys, he may have had input the the first few pairs, that is it.
Anyone know about them mjb jeans?? I’m tryna have a look
He is just humble ain’t he
Prada, lyrical MC tearer - CLASSIC.
Amiri is too cold and I’m glad it’s too expensive for the uk ‘drip influencers’ 🤣
well uzi put diamond on his head
It really makes me uncomfortable with how much his hands are always near chips mouth. Especially with the Rona about he deffo contracted it 😁
This guy is a certified pagan.
109 of stormzys followers put thumbs down 👎 lol that's funny 😄
Baskeat 🤣🤣🤣 man means banksy
At the end of the day. You buy what you like because everyone has a different taste. Be a leader and NOT a follower!!! We can't all like the same.
This guys a bit cringe...Trys a bit too hard
“The price is calm too” - £435 for a hood? Yeah, I think not 😭
No matter what it looks like,, man should never be positive about a company like shell..Fucking up Nigeria and Ghana and man still big dem up, WASTE
Chips not trendy tho he dont know shit  yall goofy 😂 dis joke
Chip's definitely aged well and kept himself looking healthy 😎👌🏽.  Furthermore, it would be nice if he talked more about career focus and possibly business investment from his experience as a young black UK artist coming from Tottenham.  Will be more inspiring to understand his drive and motivation.  I'm in mixed thoughts on this video contributing to black people's love for materialism over direction towards assets and building up wealth.🤔💭  P.S.  When Chip said looks like they 'catted' the North Face logo - haven't that in years!
Who's kaws?  Bye
Wtf does delicacy how it feels
Don't wear Moncler. Racist
Need young adz here asap
Chipmunk not Chip
Definitely true or true?...Fredo should be on this
He keeps it too real
He’s one of the most mature rappers in the world
Black people are just consumers to foreign brands and designers. What a joke mate...
man said who's KAWS it's a brand, done out
Dave needs to be on here ASAP
Applaud the work rate he’s been consistent to say the least.
Get m huncho on dis ASAP
Who’s Kews WTF get with it Chip G
Chip always keeps it 100
Dem Diesel's were surely womens Jeans?
Respect for remembering pop smoke still whoo!! 💯🙏🏽🕊
nahhh you can't talk about fashion if you dont know kaws, thats a mockery
How's he saying baggy ain't back 😂I thought Chip was on point, baggy everything is fire right now.
Where you finding that essentials FOG hoodie for £90?
whats going on Chip? I thought money didn't matter like that
GET YOUNG ADZZZZ ON THIS
i like chip....bur FUCK all these brands and this consumerism shit. if pop smoke makes you want to wear dior and amiri...you a slave to adverts ffs. wake up
Love how Chip aint spending grands on shit just because.
This guys a wanker fact
This guy needs to stop wearing fake clothes 😂😂
Chip seems like a sound easy going geezer and a very talented one too
Hahahahaahahahha who's kaws these rappers don't really know anything the ignorance.
Wasteman. £20 bags on a jacket- fruity.
U know chips a G when you refer back to the year in school u was in when referring back in the past.
Clever way for brands to cleverly do their research ... Very... Very clever
Not a suit tho is it
good for him look a good guy !
Yo you should get Digga D or Central C on here🔥
Why’s he look like he’s about to burst into tears 😂 lil bug eye
Wish he would stop covering his mouth. Some nervous habit
Man said if it was north face it would be harder... wtf no it wouldn't. Are you on crack? If it's shit it's shit no brand can change that
Chip was fully aware man. Not just going to do way with his money because of a brand name.
When you going to grow up and stop being damn shallow. You should be over this by now and concentrating on what's important.
Stay humble and honest Chip.. don’t go the Stormzy root.. stay grounded bro.. the artistry is the prize not the material..1🤍
He didn’t know about a lot of the stuff they showed.
You've not been missed mate.
Sick video - could you change the background music - more rappy less hotel lobbyish 🤣🤣🤣.
0:20 see #TrustsNo1
Man like Chip🐐
Get david bunmi on this
Nahh lol you guys didn’t show us what Yeezys chip said he has, bare pointing but can’t see lol fix that mandem
He can go to the states and call himself "CHIP" but we all remember Chipmunk ...
This is what I mean about fake ppl, this guy boasts JESUS but then starts his video worshipping satan with his hand signs.  This guy does not know God the FATHER.
rip pop smoke
Throw a Dunlop sign on some of these 'designer' garms and see how quick dem say trash
I thought Chip would be more up on brands
Would have been nice of the camera to show us the Yeezys he was pointing at 😂
89 Stormzy Fans hitting dislike
How the heck can anyone hate on this dude?!?! "If something's comfortable, put the whole world in it!" Haha. Legend.
Joke ting family.
Good to see the Microphone Champion getting the Exposure he deserves man he’s a straight up Legendary man
Lol dem jeans where 4 a chick my guy
Sorry wrong channel.. Thought i was on wish..
How embarrassing a man talking about clothes and their cost like it means SOMETHING. you have a platform, use it for good not promoting this empty soulless nonsense, to many young look up to you and to suggest that some designer brand is even worthy of thought is a shame.  Good luck, God bless
What a dunce man are getting rich from talking bwt gang and then run around screaming about police stop and search
uk has all the fire drip, but none of you can put a fit together if your life depended on it.
This stuff doesn't impress me.  What does impress me is the longevity chip has had it the game and his consistency.
wheres his beanie hat from??? 🔥
Whose kaws 😩 the disrespect
i invested the same amount of money in my first house ,now i own four houses and rent them out
He sounds more road now!! Back in the this morning and GMTV days he sounded like a church yute !! 😂
Shell / Chip Collab!!! FYAAAAA
Who are you....🖐🏾
The way he keeps touching his face irritates me heavily
"North guy, north face, im not with it" - Chip. I thought him and Bugz had sqaushed it
©️🆙️
‘“Who’s KAWS”........oh dear, I’m out ☹️
Gucci hood bruh
3:48 jacket looking like the stig iykyk
This man needs to up his knowledge can’t lie who’s kaws like
So chips a crip now
Unknown p is better than this guy
He called Banksy buskey
Baggy pants needs to come back into fashion. These men and their leggings are not making it.
Chip is better than stormy who agrees 👇
You need to need to get Fredo on this please.... he’ll shut it down different
https://youtu.be/I3evO9G8U-I
get central Cee on here
Ngl the music in these videos are a bit too slow. Should switch it up uno. But still good viseo
Surprised he'd not heard of Vetements.
Chip been knowing swag from day dot stilll
Woo made a big mark in the industry 💫💫🐐
If I could spend 20 bags on a jacket I’d definitely cop it just to say I’ve got a jacket worth 20 k lol
Nothing special about these brands, just name and clout.
Vetements defo trolling u know!!! They got a few hard t shirts but that’s about it
Long live Pop Smoke 💫
Remeber when nines said “don’t wear them boot cuts they swallow ur kick “ this is what he meant chips shoes or boots shall I call them
20k Moncler jacket looking like an astronaut ting
I don’t care what garm’s you wear
Realistic bredda dat, big up to chip
20k for that moncler thats just silly
Chip is cool
Uno chipmunk a shy guy but massive salute to him for always remaining humble in the game he deserves everything he’s got
Tryna put everybody on Casablanca 😪🥱😟
I’m glad he’s stopped pretending Ellesse was making a comeback 🙏🏽
chip talking sense - way more likeable than he used to be imo. big up
Why does chip look like a lesbian
Been following chip from the start of his career, and he doesn’t fail with outfits, he dresses well
Moncler is made in Romania lol, these brands are laughing all the way to the bank.
Chip has been in the game for 13 years + I think, and he still looks 20 😂
Kaws mad price is because of the price of his art work which  is replicated from old cartoons but he just added  dead eyes to the cartoon characters.  Nothing special still.
This is embarrassing
Every thing in this video is overpriced junk with a brand name slapped on it. These brands have been swindling wannabe millionaires for so long.
Chip used to have slight classy vibes now I’m not so sure... Each to their own!
Why don't you be smart and invest save and look after your family nothing impressive about wasting money
Nobody can quiet waste money on trash more efficiently than a rapper.
come on chippy keep up the energy and tunes loving the album
Watching this like I can afford any of this
GET FREDO ON THIS😤😤😤
North face Gucci collab shit on vetements, it's a Mazza!
The title of this video should be "Chipmunk talks the same dumbass shit that black people have been buying for many years which have kept us on the bottom of the food chain. Trash."  Start talking about investing in the future of finance, crypto.
"if it's comfortable... put the whole planet in it" ...underrated outlook on fashion, make everything comfortable!!!
Prada never left been wearing those since high school and have 2 pairs the now if anyone was sleeping on them I never new 🤷‍♂️
Get Bugzy Malone nexttt
Nice to see a UK artist who can actually say more than “that’s cold still” lol
Chip is up
He'd be wearing crosshatch if he couldn't rap let's be honest.
Man said he’s always rated FOG but thinks zipper denim are a new thing loool
Chip:How much do they go for without the resale?  Person:£90  Chip:oH Is ThAt It  Me:fuck kinda pricey uno   Also me:need to get my bread up man😂😂
Get young smokes on here
Most these UK rappers think essentials is a brand smh
I rate this channel but you lot need to diversify and try get people who are actually into fashion. Most rappers in UK just tend to follow what everyone considers 'drip'. If you're into your fashion u know that Alyx x Moncler jacket is a piece.
Where do you get that Shell hoodie
Mate you can afford the gucci houdie not everyone 🤣😂😭
"The rollie is presidential like it's vote time"
i spit on my grandma
He’s high af
Little wrestling - YouTube
I were Debenhams and boohoo man clothing 😂😂
Man said vet-ta-ments
Mans really said he hasn’t seen people wearing baggy jeans atm, he must be walking around w his eyes closed then
If you come from struggle, how could you justify spending 20k on a jacket 🤣 that money could keep you alive and well for a year lol
😋😋😋
Bo selecta
I feel like chip was so comfortable when he explaining his stand
that jacket looks cold in video with the right lights, i cant remembr what rapper it was i think a US one but bro iit fuckin shinesss
20 racks for a jacket LMAO I don't give a fuck what make it is they wanna behave
really u get chip on and talk all this bullshit with him
Nice Benjart jacket is what you need!
Believe & Achieve 🏆
I got chips boots from shoezone for £20!
"My father is not having job" "I want to do something for my parents" "But youtube is not giving me views " Ya I am worse than others "😟...
Little baby Chipmunk still be looking 12
He seems really shy.. always covers his mouth when talking.. Cute!!! Love chip.x humble.x He don't seem materlistic...he's got more about him than that.x
How does he not know vetemens
When are people going to wake up and see these clowns for what they are
Homosexual lol
What a joke
Doesn’t even know Vetements 🤣
I haven’t seen one guy wearing a fashionable outfit on this show and supposed to tell us what trend is 💀 doesn’t even know what Kaws is for example..
Been waiting for a little chat interview with Chippy.
Do you guys not drink for 24 hours before or something
Still blessed, and still a humble guy.
It's cool, to support these brands, but we need to circulate our dollars within our community also.
He looks 6 and 30 at the same time
Get me to 1 million subs content coming soon. I’m homeless and need a house and a ps5 to stream more content.
You never know in this life enit its all one big bag of gas 😂
Lets goooo chipppp. 💯 best one
Great video
Not going to lie. I watch this to see what brands are not being ruined by road gutter trash. Nothing beats wearing a £2000 pure cashmere jumper and walking past some prick in a £400 Gucci jumper thinking he’s a G.
Why is he trying to talk like a BAD g. Embarrassing
Kaws a real legend if uno uno
Nah chips a lovely and logical individual. Respect ✨🤘
Humble guy, man could buy up the whole shop if he wanted too but passed on steep prices. 🐐
need central cee on here
Hide the brand and see if they say ‘trend’ or ‘trash’ then reveal the brand and price 🤣
