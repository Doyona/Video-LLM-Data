True story my mentor tatted uzi’s security guard he had with him in this video, super chill guy💯
I would not think this nigga would be good at ball, that's crazy. Homie got skills. Never under estimate niggas for good or bad. Always keep your eye on the person next to you and never under estimate anyone
Uzi face when buddy came up to him for pics 😂😂
They were force feeding him shoes like a Pokémon 💀
Goat never miss
Bro I almost unsubscribe your account when you pull that bull with lil Uzi 🤔🤦🏽
