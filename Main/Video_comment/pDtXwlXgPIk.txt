Azz con targa originale MO 66177...
Ain't no freaking car worth no 25 millions dollar's
Perfect car jacking.
I thought he said I'm the founding German. Haha
Big CHEMTRAILS on your head!

This is our Ferrari 🇷🇺
If I see Dan  I want to say the same thing to him😉
Wow and it has the original plate MO from Modena, incredible!
Que suerte estar tan feliz
People who get to see these cars are really lucky
WHISTLIN DIESEL HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
I did the math - pound for pound - and I can buy two lugnuts from that car with what I earned last year. Maybe.
It's an awesome car and an expensive car but 25 mil? Highly questionable. £432,000 for an absolutely mint example, maybe 5 mil if it was it previously owned by Papa Noel and had province that both David Bowie and David Hasselhoff had been conceived in the car and that's a big IF.
Excellent
Founding charming of what?
That car is not worth 25M$ 🤦‍♂️😑 at this point hes just making up The Car values
How can it be worth $25 million😑😑
Original italian Plate "MO" Stands for Modena ❤️💙❤️💙
That car is not worth anywhere close to 25 million
This POS worth 25M? 🤬 this world smoking 😭
Hot car😳😳
All the rich people in Eternal Hellfire only want a drop of water now
Well the car cost $25 million but it isn’t worth $25 million.
“Clearly a rental” *half of DanielMac’s comment section in 2022*
25 mil USD for a motherfucking car is completely ridiculous for anyone tbh
I wouldn't spend 25k on that car....
This one would be very hard to beat!
The 250swb is one of the best cars ever
My god you're sad asking people what they do
Bruce Meyer is the G of all Gs
Are you kidding me right now!!I could literally walk twice as fast as this car,70s-80s it's so hideous to be worth that much
Bro this is minimum 100mln $ look at his history

I love that guy, what a happy guy. Love it when he said yaaaa

Homie got finessed, 25 mil?😂 Idc if it's the only one in the world shits not worth 1mil to me
Mines better! He don't want no smoke

I love that he’s just cruising in a literal museum exhibit 😤🔥doing what it was meant for being driven and enjoyed!
Investment but I don’t think it’s worth it

Is it my impression or this is the coolest millionaire ever ? That Yheaa said it all .
Plot twist - it’s a kit car.  Lol

Bruce Meyer made his fortune in real estate. Famously involved in the car culture. Seems like a nice guy.
Atm this car is worth 17.6m
The classic cars are so fucking coool
Such a natural and humble reaction! Owners of the most expensive cars in this channel always are easy going; but check on the 200k dollar mark ones, oh boy 🙄
This gets passed over but this is insane. Literally the craziest car he’s done
Who ever says money can’t buy happiness I’m gonna show them this video 😂😂
A very nice guy that car is also in forza horizon 5 and it’s work the same amount.
Ferrari: I am worth 25$ million...  Bugatti: am I joke to you???
Car is 18.6M not 25 right?
That was Bruce Meyers.  He made his money selling candles and diversifying into real estate.
That's one garbage ass pos, just like all Ferraris. You have to be stupid to buy 1.
It’s of  no more worth than a Vauxhall corsa. It’s a lump of metal .  Someone decided it was worth 25 million . It’s not worth 25 million.
Fake
Bruh are they paying you so they can flex in a humble way?
A common theme in these is that people are almost always smiling….and they say money can’t buy happiness 😂

That man has hacked life
That car was driven just for this short vid. It doesn't normally see the outside world.
It's ugly
California really is a remarkable place...you have the handful of elites driving their 25 million dollar cars through homeless lined streets.
He's the founding german
His car is worth that only if someone is insane enough to pay it
That car is a work of art
Not worth 3million let alone 25
He's so cool👌🏽
I really feel left aside hearing and seeing several testimonies from people on profits they make from Bitcoin/Forex Investment. Can someone recommend a good expert that trade on my behalf and generate profit for me
That's like the worst car I've seen on here what's with the value😂 was it like in a movie or something
I knew Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself
Isnt it lile 7 million im pretty sure its 7 million

None of these people really say what they do for a living. Founding chairman is not how he made his money.

He passed the vibe check for sures😎
PLEASE STOP saying “awesome” or “that’s awesome”. It’s the only thing that ruins your videos!!!!
That’s one sexy mf car 🥲
Old is always GOLD 💗🔥🔥
All these videos are staged/fake
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
The Petersen Automotive museum is awesome. I knew that was it as soon as I saw the parking lot in the background. Went there over the summer. Amazing cars

Danielmac: “I love your car, what you do for a living”  Drug dealer: “😳”

I love your car, what do you do for living? I'm not sure it's a compliment or making a question.
Does that car really cost twice as much as the same car that didnt lemans? Thats crazy...10-15 million just for history, but same car
Looking it up this car was sold for around €8.3M

I've never seen sad millioner only on the movies haha... this guy can fix my life just by selling one of the wheels on that car
Daniel Mac a Shorts GOD. 🙏
He literally said thank you for being here 😃
Finally one that doesn’t look staged
25 million... That's beyond insane. I will never get how a car could cost that much.
I poured that top parking deck about 6 7 years ago
Bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill nye the science guy
I am also very worthy and rich
When you drive around in a Lamborghini and think your rich 😂 then this dude pulls up on you in his classic 👀💀😂

Nice! Click on Da Bird and see where he takes you!
This man gives off big Weiner energy

He’s a founding German ?
Nbd just Bruce Meyer....  Yo WTF
Cool car he was definitely talking to the camera
✌✌✌✌✌🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Fye
I feel like his recent videos are being staged and set up... they lack authenticity
That surely can’t be 25,000,000 right? 😮
It’s fake
I will remember this the next time they send me emails asking for donations......
From 25,000,000 to 20,000,000 in a second
Oh my God are you Daniel mac oh man you're so amazing dude yeah come on my yacht man you're so great because you're on tiktok!🤣🤣😂😂👍👍
I want to be as humble as this man when I get old bro 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
It's one thing to say what it's worth it's another thing to get the price for it
It's one thing saying how much a car is worth it's another thing to see the price you get for it. And you did not see a hundred million dollar 250 in Florida these cars do not sell for those numbers the owner say they're worth this but they never can get the price not even close. I work for Barrett-Jackson auctions. People please get real quick talking out of your ass
No this is not a $25 million car it was auctioned at Barrett-Jackson auctions 11 years ago for a 3.6 million please stop you're lying
Holy shit thats a 1 in a lifetime spotting of that car moving
I run bentley, i mean im a marketing manager at 1 location.
That car is fake
Holy I'm early af
