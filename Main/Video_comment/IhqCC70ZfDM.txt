These thicc bois are REALLY good this year if you need one.
@Dave2D Which tool did you use to check the frame rate of the game you were playing?
Just picked up a. 16" M1 Max with 46hrs on the battery, in like new condition, put Apple Care on it and so happy.
I never really thought about it, but you're so much older than I thought you were? Nice job on self care and congrats on good genes lol
Intro was nice
why are you so soft spoken like a sissy?
"Everything is good when you go Thick" hahahahaha. Awesome reviews, goin to buy one now at a discount.
3 years DAMN.
Dave2D,  is the 2021 Apple MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Max Chip (16-inch, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD Storage), a good buy in 2025, for productivity?
If Dave is in his 40s then Im prolly in my 100s now
Dave going off with Hanzo

Hello Dave,  Now m1 max 64gb version wth 2tb ssd at 2899$ is hot deal or not?
Is no one going to talk about the fact that Dave is 40?
What’s the advantage to having the ‘auto-on, auto-wake’ feature when I lift the lid? I’d prefer to turn on my MacBook Pro myself, manually. How can I disable this ‘auto-wake’ feature?
Excuse me,Would you really pay $5000 for a Laptop? ,Can i ask you what company do you own and how many people have you on the books, But i just realised you’re an Apple fan boy.😂😂😂😂😂😂
They are just tools. Thanks, now I am not buying a MacBook.
The bloom on this screen is mostly hidden by your eyes' natural handling of light. In high contrast situations, your eyes create bloom themselves. It's really only detectable to me in a very dark room.
The screens on these fail constantly and can only be fixed at apple. DO NOT BUY the 2021 model!
Hi  Dave when you talk about speaker systems it is no doubt apple has a very good and in some cases superior speaker system.  However, with some of the new enhancement sorftware available, some of the other laptops are capable of very rich and loud sound reproduction.  For example,  I have had the Macbook Pro M1 and I now have the Lenovo Thinkpad x1 extreme with Dolby atmos software.   I adjusted the Equalizer to fit my own personal sound preferences, and the result was amazing.  Surprisingly, it is a worthy competitor to the Macbook Pro speaker systems.   I do not know what measurments you use in your reviews, but I think sometimes you fail to consider the whole picture when tallking about some features, and therefore deprive the viewer of a completey accurate description.  You are still one of my favorite reviewers, but as human beings we cannot help being somewhat subjective in our assessments and evaluations,  which  is a  challenge of course in a situations that demand objectivity.
1:17 THICCC is the key to success ~Dave2D
Apple Store at Central world in Thailand so fucking service.
how did he run overwatch 2 on that mac, was it windows parallels?
Great video. I appreciated your honest thoughts at the end about “keeping it real” when it comes to purchasing a MacBook Pro. It is indeed a tool and a MacBook Air would suffice for a lot of people instead. Thanks again.
Mac vs windows video
Dave sounded kinda salty at the end. Like the “I’m a windows fanboy” kinda salty 😆
That NF Cameo tho!!
Nice review! I was almost getting the 14” M1 pro, since I work with coding and also Photoshop/Illustrator. But after this video, you put a doubt in my head: do I really need it for this kind of use, or a simple Pro M2 would be fine? Could you help, please?
slow down jezz
Mother....er you look 20
"Everything is good when you go thick"
Bloom what bloom, I don't see em 😭😭😭😭
I have a dream to buy Macbook 16
I wish they had a number pad, its so useful
Super 👌
you're 40? Dude you look 25
Yeah right “everything is good when you go thick”
Right now I have a refurbished 2015 MBP, loaded with Monterey version 6.  Maybe someday I'll be able to buy a modern devise.  I haven't finished setting it up yet so I have no idea if it is going to work on my work web site (at least one feature of which is not secured).   Besides, if I understand this right the 2015 will be dropped in a few years.
These are tools, that’s all they are❤
I love the end that's his honest review and it's so good so happy he is doing so well.
We received those at work last week and I migrated all my workflows and data to it. It is a fantastic machine, and I think that, as a keyboard snob, it’s the best laptop keyboard I have played with for a long time. I also like the simplistic aesthetics of the case and the thickness. The screen panel is really the best thing I have looked at and coding on such a platform is a real joy.
And soon, all the other brands will copy Apple's ugly notch.
May i know where you bought your hoodie?
Dave, which one you prefer Mac studio or 14 inch m1 proo. Please need a help for my purchase. Thanks.
Is it possible to hook up 2 thunderbolt supported displays to a MacBook m1 max directly or are there issues? Thank you for the vid!! Love your channel 💓
Thank you for pointing out that these are tools. I think a lot of us got caught up with the new design and capabilities of the new chips that we forget that these are really expensive and should you really do your research on them if you are doing professional work or if you have the money to spend. The battery life is what is drawing me to these computers, battery life is so important to me in my field of work and how my country is set up! And I also use my laptop for entertainment as well so I need something long term, which this laptop might give me.
Oh jeez, since when you got grey hair? I feel old...
haha .. "i'm old, i'm 40" love the review..
Everything is good when you go thick (pauses for a moment) 😏
Nice review. Specially the last piece of advice.  I’m interested in buying a MacBook. Budget wise I would be more comfortable with the 14in. But I want a bigger screen. N I don’t to buy an external monitor as I’m on the move plus I won’t get to use the sole Apple display.
Ya, that last bit of advice I really appreciate you saying that man.  One of the reasons I love your channel so much.  I agree with so many of the comments people have made.
Yes. I hope that they’ll never make the pro thinner again.
Dave4D
Dell's webcam doesn't get a pass but old hdmi ports do? Feels like if Apple delivers subpar products it's okay but if Dell do it's terrible.
what typing app is that please?
I got a question; so I need a laptop for my College because I’m going to take photography and I was going to get MacBook Pro 14-inch M1 Pro should I get 32GB memory or the regular 16 GB, but one of my friends said that MacBook Pro is not good after 2016. I think that what he said was he told me to get an Asus laptop idk what model tho 😆 so what laptop should I get?
Candid, professional, and heartfelt review. Thanks.
These displays have poor response time
Your old you imitation earned you a like!
Everything is good when it go thick. Indeed, Dave knows what’s up
Blue? It’s like that one famous dress… is it blue or not??
8:14  Thanks, I know this but I still want it. Lenovo Legion is perfectly fine for me (except for when I'm traveling because this power brick is heavy).
i gotta know where u got that hoodie from dave
You are right, it is just tools.
When you said you’re 40, I was shook
IM,.NEW SUBSCRIBE
Great video as always
Wah, you look like a teenager than a 40 year old guy!
How is Dave 40, I am stunned by learning this.
Well said sir, well said. "they're tools, that's all they are". thanks for mentioning at the end that these laptops aren't for fun usage, they are build for professionals and so on. Great video, like always
Review m2 air like this only
Does anyone know what typing test app he’s using all on his laptop reviews? 🙏
“Everything is good when you go thick “ - Dave2D
Dave you’re the ONLY channel I trust. You’re so damn honest it’s so refreshing and your presentation is clear, concise, and without any unnecessary BS other reviews do. Cheers.
Stickers, engraving are not important. You emphasize for apple but not for anyone else
You're 40?! My bro what body part of yours is 40?
The number of times he's mentioned 'thick.'
Everything’s good when you go thicc  - Dave
best for creatives tbh
Hell nah he is 40 i don't believe it
I have a question im going to university this year and was looking to upgrade my MacBook from either a new laptop in general or get a new MacBook Pro or even but an iPad or something like that and I was wondering that if I was to buy this item is it going to be worth it for school or shall I just stick with my 2020 MacBook Pro
"everything's good when you go thicc" hahahaha😂🤣😂🤣
Batman is the best movie to test the screen 🤣🤣
wait how tf is he showing the batman before it came out
my m1 max brand new got toasted within 2 weeks of purchase . all i did ? leave it at my desk and not move it until full skins arrive for 5 days 8 days of minimal browsing and firmware update not even gaming and secured partition got corrupted , was not able to recover [ store told me they couldn't reinstall mac os on their side either and had to send it back] returned this overpriced piece right away before hitting the last day . Hype was too much . looks good but reliability = 0 . wait for M3 or even M5  future buyers . If you're a gamer don't even look at the mac . M1 Max 16
macbook pro 14 inch m1 max 64gb ram 1tb ssd Do you suffer from high fever? And low battery?  I trust you, waiting for your reply Thank you
so many legendary quotes in this video. "that good good" "everything's good when you go thiqq"
40?! Bro you look 25
I did regret a bit buying the base Macbook Pro 14. But it's apple, and it would still be usable in 8-10 years(coming from a late 2013 MacBook pro 15). So that's my justification :D
Yeah, I do the Emails, MS-Office and YouTube on my 14" M1 Pro. Real fun purchase
I can't believe that you are 40 yeats old
wait what !!?? this guy is 40 yrs old!!
50?????😳😳😳😳😳
"Everythings good when you go thick" 😉
Hahaha, I did pick it up as a fun purchase and now I'm broke.
YOU'RE 40!?  Dude, you look like in your 20s
Wait?  You're 40 years old?  You were born in 1981 or 1982?????  What the what?
A lot of people use a tape on the webcam for security and apple give them the notch to do that without Interference with the display and face id .ffuunnnny
how are you 40?!?!?. you look 23😂
4444444444444444444444444000000000000000000000000000????????????????????????
You guys need to stop with the Apple stickers. They're just stickers.  And most people let them rot inside the box anyway.
He's 40??? He looks 25
Fyi all lcd local dimming will bloom regardless of the number of local dimming zones. Only oled will never bleed but can only do sustain brightness of 200-300 nit and sustain brightness of 500 nits then specular highlights of 900nits. Thats why mini led on ipad and macbook pro 14 and 16 is unmatched right now. Have you see a youtuber comparing oled vs mini led on side by side?
Hi Dave, been following you for years now. I hit that sub button when you were starting and you’ve always saved me from making wrong decisions buying a laptop. Anyway, here’s my story, I started with a Macbook pro, the white model, that was 2012-ish? Then, I switched to Windows because you were into XPS. This year, like now, I decided to buy an XPS 15 9510…after 7 days I decided to return it because of the battery. I get 4 hours of light usage, with a notepad, task manager, google chrome apps and battery settings to monitor my power usage. Which should not be the case. This time, because I dropped by your video, I’ll buy the base model Macbook Pro 16” with that M1 chip! I hope I’ve seen this video before I bought the XPS. Great content as always! 🤩
That's what she said
world's on fire, dave: wassup? port!
✅
Actually m1 pro(10 core) is 6 times slower at AI-based video processing than i7-3770k+2060s. On a macbook it takes 36 hours to process video, on my PC it takes 6 hours.
bro aint no way you are 40 you dont look a day over 26
wow the 16 version has a batter screen lol I'm glad picked this one
You 40? 😅
Everything's good when you go thick 😁😁😂
Hey Dave, how did you get Overwatch to work on your MacBook pro? I don't think it has a mac client and BootCamp can't be used on the new macs, right?
"They are really cool, but they are tools"👍
where is the wallpaper link bro?
Extremely Outstanding, Professional & Perfect M1 Max MacBook Pro Review Video by you Sir....😝😝👻👻👽
I think Dave made a really honest comment 'these are tools'. For the vast majority, the best thing to go is the M1 chip products (MBA, Macmini, imac), the unified memory and super high speed storage can basically fulfill any needs. Leave those high end products to those who produce videos, movies, photos and so one.
40 !!?
4:39 what is the typing app please?
You are so right about the hdmi port it's for keynote/PowerPoint presentations not 120htz gaming.
Hi Personal question Mate, How can a YouTube guy afford to pay $5000 for a laptop i must be in the wrong profession.
soon as I saw that notch I was out. I refuse to buy something with such an ugly, lazy and terrible design
you're 40 wtf you look 30 at a push
I👏 cannot 👏 believe 👏 Dave 👏is 👏40. I wouldn't give you a day over 30 😂
LOL Dave, you talked me down from the ledge of purchasing the 14" M1 Pro tomorrow. I was flip flopping and wanted to replace my Macbook air (2017) and possibly sell my Windows PC and consolidate down to 1 Macbook laptop but I think for now, I will stick to what I have. Also, I hope I age as well as you do my friend. You don't look close to 40!  Edit: NVM I caved and bought one LOL
Can somebody tell which typing app did Dave used in the video https://youtu.be/IhqCC70ZfDM?t=274
i bought me and my wife the m1 max i got the 16 inch and she got the 14 inch. Man the smaller one is so nice. But every time i look at my screen im happy to have got the 16 inch, but i wouldn't be mad if i ended  up with the 14 inch.
I want the Touch Bar. ‘‘Twas my favorite
I use my 16in to watch YouTube videos
You are 40?  I thought you where 29. lol
Everything is better when you go thick.😉😉😉
1:16 Dave: Everything's good when you go thick. the whole internet: That's what she saidddd!
ARE YOU 40? O M G
"Everything's good when you go thicc." - Dave2D
NAh u look fine to me like 28 ~ 33 yo
Everything is good, when you go THICC!
you're 40?? thought you were like 28 lol! 🤣
Bro. HOW ARE YOU 40?!?
The last sentence… man… That is the gold in this video….
It's about honesty, it's about wholesomeness.
BTS FTW!!!
"What did it cost.
Dave @1:11 "I love the thickness", me too bruh, me too!
I thought Dave was like early 30s
For someone who mix productivity and gaming in equal measure, these bad bois are really tempting but its a bit hard to splurge a few ks on one of this beautiful hardware and a gaming pc when i can just get a good gaming laptop and do very well on both fronts.  Wish Apple have more interest in making their hardware more game-friendly.
I like the part where you explicitly mention that these are "just tools". That part IS important.
wait ur 40? wtf good genes my man
He’s 40??
You're 40?  I thought you're like 25
He is among the legends who still play Slither.io
biggest takeaway of this video is ï'm 40
This is ridiculous your comparing this thing to a 1500$ laptop with a gpu designed for gaming not productivity! absolutely ridiculous pathetic!
Literally everyone using a thick **generic** notebook: "WTF is that S**T" Literally now everyone using an ugly 2021 thick M1 macbook: "Notebook's thickness is good and necessary for I/O ports, battery, etc."  To me the new macbooks don't look like innovation. At all.
There's nothing better than Dave's Grandpa voice.
Dave is 40, my god he looks so young
I bought one today.  M1 Pro 16 1TB.  My last mbp was a 2015 retina that I bought RIGHT before the touchbar was added. It's been my workhorse since; but I've been in dire need of an upgrade. This was it.
Dave, 8:15 talked to me. My wife and my wallet thank you. Best, long time fan.
40? Dude you look 28 at max.
That last part of the video tells out loud that you care...
"They're tools. That's all they are." That's such a zen way of reviewing tech. Great job--love your videos!
Wait. YOU are 40!! Dam u look 10 years younger!!
The notch needs to go, it seriously has no place on a laptop. There are many laptops out there with bezels as thin as this without needing to resort to a notch. This just creates the unnecessary association between notches and thin bezels in the consumer's mind.
"everything is good when you go thicc" that's a word to the wise.
It's just a tool! That's what it is! Dave's certainly got 40 years of wisdom. ❤️
No way this dude is 40
This is when Razer’s new babies priced similar to these new macs.. i’d rather have BurgerKing😬🤣
Tbh I kinda like the camera notch. Its like the iphones
That was the cleanest Slither.io kill I’ve ever seen
Thanks man. Great review
im looking for 15 or 16 inch, and it price equal to macbook air m1 , it is like they just know my need and work perfectly to not produce the same.thats definitely  a crime
Is it me or does the trackpad for the 16 inch MacBook Pro have a slight rattle that you can hear and kind of feel which each click.
Dave, you are the BEST!
dave's 40??????
is it just me or are they ugly af
Hey Dave. You don’t feel it’s ugly a little bit?
Dave is 40!? Wtf?
Great videos 👍 congrats! Ps.   You don't look 40 at all. Lol  cheers from Texas!
I love this guy! Awesome review. Awesome.
I'm so glad Jony Ive is no longer with Apple.
have u listen to Huawei laptop speakers?, I think they're louder and maybe better sound
You're 40!!??
Loved the sticker joke :) I got myself a 16" maxed out M1 Max and it's a bit of a struggle to transition from PC, but I feel like I'll keep it. My amateur review: https://youtu.be/Hym3Q8BhnZc
Dell xps has windows hello ir camera . Apple with  a big ass notch atleast could've given face Id
Bro, I don't believe you 40, you give way to good reviews for a 40yr old.
Would love to see a mouse/keyboard tierlist. I'm in the market and I'm sure many others would be very interested.
Hey Dave2D! Just recently got a maxed out MacBook Pro 16 inch, but I can't seem to get better than like 14 fps on overwatch w/ parallels. how did you achieve 120 fps?
WTH, i am 32 and look way older than you. Best reviews always.
you are 40 ??? What the hell man. You look WAY younger. Good Review, btw !
How do you made your intro. Is it with after effects or something else.  You can make a video or course on skillshare.
Respect that he’s not pushing you to buy it. Good video.
Lol you get a free 10¢ max apple stickers after spending +1000 €/$  because you have a top tier laptop 🤦🏾‍♂️😁😁
"I'm forty"  Me, thinking he was 26: *surprised Pikatchu face*
1:16 - "Everything's good when you go thicc" - Dave 2k21
YOU ARE NOT 40 WHATT I DONT BELIEVE  YOU
6:59 what happened to the screen?
You know it’s going to be a good video when Dave uses the Minecraft intro
Your last line was the best! These are just tools is what they are. People who can't justify the cost shouldn't get temempted. Excellent video. Loved the presentation and the detail. Kept me engaged till the end. Thank you for the effort.
This guy is NOT 40 yrs old. Late 20s I'd say
You need to do a video on the amano style aquarium you’ve got.
Oh gee Dave is 40 now??
I loved the closing words
Your completely right I don’t need it….. but I want it so much. I have my eyes set on the 16” M1 pro 1tb ssd. The price isn’t cheap ($2,700) but I want it because I want a laptop that is future proof, good display, good battery, connects with my ecosystem, and Mac OS
That there is a good old person impression.
Wow you’re 40?
Been saying for years that Apple kept falling further and further away from a balance of form and function. Glad to see they are embracing that principle again. Tt was core value during the Jobs years and one of the things that made them special. Considering buying an Apple product for the first time in over a decade.
Love the ending. You’re so right
"Everything's good when you go thicc." That's why I love black girls.
Can anyone help?  I just received my MacBook Pro 16" M1 Pro.  The lid is loose (no tension) when I go to open the lid until about 2 inches up.  Is this normal or a defect.  It's a little more tense when you go to close it, but then it kind of collapses right at the bottom.  I am looking at YouTube videos to find out if anyone else has this issue.  When I look at his opening the display in the video (tense throughout) it doesn't look like my issue.  Can anyone comment about your MacBook Pro and let me know if there is "play" when opening and closing?  There's also a little "shimmy" when opening up the display.  Thank you.
You're seeing things dave, maybe a sign of aging? Good to see you thought about that tho
4:19 you are 40????? WTF you look in your twenties.
s the backing for the keyboard coated in something? I felt my friends model and it felt like it but I can't tell cause everyone says its anodized aluminum. I know the material under it is, just trying to work out if there's a coating. For context, I am allergic to the metal and can put dbrand skins and cases everywhere else, except there. If that is coated, it would mean that I can get it!
Just a question I am wondering if you are switching to a MacBook form the razer blade
I know it's just a tool that I can't afford and don't need but I bought one anyway
it is just a tools. Well said!
He’s 40?!
Nice table setup .. finally :)
Great video!
Is the 14" can be easily overheated using the m1 max configuration?
you know shit's real when there's the black stickers.
It goes through the notch, thats the most important thing :D
still not buying.. i'm not spending 2 lakh rupees xD
The Notch is unnecessary. It works on the iPhone but not on MacBooks
wtfff he is 40???? my whole life has been a lie
So I decided to go with the greatest no brainer configuration 16.5" M1 Pro base model for an extra 200$ over the 14" M1 pro base model. Mainly because you get a bigger XDR display and it has more battery life then the MacBook air! Plus I get two extra CPU cores & two extra GPU cores which is a bonus for me. In addition I also upgraded the SSD to 1TB for future proofing.  If you have any spare time and would like to check out my M1 pro unboxing with a beginners perspective since I only shot it with my iPhone 📹😁Thank you in advance and I hope you have a great day!!!
That old man expression has been nominated for an oscar.
Dave is 40.... Dave4D.....
Dave, can you do a gaming review comparing the performance of a 16" mbp with both cpu. Please do specifically a flight simulator review like mfs flight sim and xplane. Thank you!
Dave’s FORTY???
Hey Dave, has the new MacBook pro 16-inch been shipped yet? I just bought one and the salesman told me it was the brand new MacBook pro but this appears to have the Intel chip rather than the new M1 chip.
I just uploaded a new video of the new apple MacBook Pro. Hope u will come and watch it too
Bro you’re 40!!!! I’m 19 and you look younger than me!!!!
Can I ask do the stickers have a good non-reflective coating? And how long does the glue last for?
Thicc is good
Absolutely revolutionary technology, I would love to buy one, but there is a slight problem at least with my budget. M1 MAX is going for approximately 3000+ pounds where performance wise R9 5900h and RX6800M cost approximately 1400+ Pounds. There is just this massive gap, if I had all of the money I would go for MacBook believe me, but Considering this strange price tag bloated by years of development this tech it doesn't make sense for now at least. Edit. okay it seems R9 5900h isnt as good as M1 MAX in terms of pure performance but still, you get the point.
This guy said he is 40. 😦
Such a good point about the fact they are tools and specific tools at that. If you do a lot of editing these couldn't be more perfect. If you're looking for a general laptop, probably not worth it.
“Everything good when u go thick” haha
Free Palestine
40! He looks younger then 22!!
Love your videos Dave! You're the best! <3
40 today. Don't forget to let us know when you get to 30.
amazing
that notch .... no thank you .. snap on camera that you can remove would be better
A friend of mine got one of these and he is concerned about how got it gets.   It was getting up there in the 80 degree. Wondering if it is a hardware issue or software. Or if most of the heat is supposed to come out of the chassis. How did the ones you got get on?
Hi !, i  play some league of legends,tft,apex and runescape... 2 weeks ago i bought a hp omen 15 with ryzen 7 and 3070 for 1800 euro's but the cpu was 90degrees celcius when playing runescape and it was hella loud !! so i refunded it ...  i was wondering if someone has recommandations for good/silent 2021 laptops.   this macbook m1pro is tempting
"Everything good when you go thick"
Should I get a barely used MacBook air M1 or wait half a year for the new air M2?
How many years would I expect to get out of this device? 4-6-8?
4:51 That kill is amazing!
We just gonna skip over the fact that he's somehow 40?!
40? Fake news! You're at least 21!
Dude! Your not 40 man! Your 25 Dave! You age well family 💪
I'm starting to see white hair strants on his head 🧐
Dave is 40? or 40 by 2040?  Keep up the good work.
Dave claims hes 40. Hehe, i see what you did there fellow Gen Z kid.
Premiere is trash.
I still have my 2012 MacBook Pro… and I love it. Waited till this day… and finally Apple made something that makes me want to buy a new MacBook. I’m probably not the target for this product, but after almost 10 years I deserve this :)
Hey, a question to anyone who can help: Would it be better to buy 14‘‘ M1Pro 8 Core CPU / 14 Core GPU with 32GB RAM or 14‘‘ M1Pro 10 Core CPU / 16 Core CPU with 16 GB RAM. Which one is more future-proof, both upgrades together (RAM+Chip) are probably too expensive for me. Use cases are creative work, school and the usual daily tasks (media consumption, etc.) and I‘d like to keep this laptop for at least 6 years without any major perfomance issues. (My current HP laptop has lasted me about 7-8 years, but it‘s had bigger issues for about 3 years now)
I like how the space grey blends in with the screen I can’t even see the edges
1:16 Thats what she said
He is 40👀👀👀👀
Dave I don't buy the "cam quality" excuse for the notch... We have bezels like the ones found in Xperia devices where the camera resides and it is a 5mm bezel. The selfie camera while not top of the market it is definitely years away laptop webcams including Surfaces and MacBooks. In reality the notch is there to give the MacBook a signature look and prepare the path to the next MacBook with Face ID. That is it.

Who will be the first to have the ‘courage’ to present a fair ‘like for like’ comparison between Pro vs Max but with same chassis, same RAM, same SSD? All reviews thus far compare Max vs Pro but with other differentials. Either 16GB RAM vs 32GB or 32GB vs 64GB or 512GB SSD vs 1TB SSD. Given the SSD  read/write differences or 16/32 RAM or memory b/w 200GB vs 400Gb etc none are equal representation. I want to see a Pro vs Max comparison where all else is equal. Otherwise all other comparisons are moot. Is there some moratorium on such a side by side shootout?
It's mind blowing that this guy looks 20 but is actually 40 ;-;
Someone please help me! I am buying the base model 16” with 1 TB SSD. But I’m confused whether I should upgrade the ram to 32gb. I do 4K video editing, photo editing and am learning music production. I’m already spending above my budget. But I really want the device to last long as well! So please help me! I am so damn confused! Thanks🖤
6:57 not going to lie...I just shit my pants. I thought my screen just died!

Forget about his face even his voice doesn’t match his age. He looks 27 at most.
Your 40?!?!?!?!?!?!
i am hoping they bring this design to the 13inch mbp. Having just the base M1 with all those ports would be so nice for an everyday laptop and a very good travel photo/video editing laptop especially when you already have a power desktop at home.
you are defending basic stuff on a machine that costs like a car? lol, new level of bottoms. Lucky me i got Apple stocks instead of their products XD
Wait what you are 40?  I thought you are 5 years younger than MKBHD
40!!!???
why dont you look 40....
The sticker I was dying laughing hilarious
Thank you Dave for that end summary/warning. They almost had me buying one.
srry but the notch is NOT ok
As a producer and audio engineer for edm with hundred tracks per project without need for video processing, this is a life saver.
40 is not old I love the video.
Hope got this one soon 😊
Remember, this has the pro apple sticker. Thats all you really to know really.
40? Shut the front door! I am 46 and look about 20 years older than you.
Was really considering buying one, then i saw the notch hahaha, insta skip ! waiting 2022 version once they removed that joke of a notch

No Face ID is because it’s too thick
40? You sir have some amazing genes, your ancestors done evolved well.🥲😅
I knew Dave was 40 cause of his ice cream gear, Dave got taste

“every thing is good when its thicc” naughty naughty
What typing speed test do you use?
Dave, when you said you were 40, I was completely shocked. You look 25  lol
Hands down to the Dave2D 👏🙌 Thank God we have you, no long introduction, no bs, not too much talking, straight to the point, stating the facts, quick and fast, I love it!!  Thank you Dave 🙏
Life choices... Buy an apple and be cool and trendy or buy a PC laptop that can do the same for 1000-1500 less and use that money to improve the world. There's a reason the logo of apple simbolizes the original sin ;) and i don't care if you tell me a similar PC can't do the same. They can and they are a lot more upgradable, repairable, and versatile. Although It's always funny to see apple trolling their fans with amazing features like ports or notches🤣 thank you for your last words Dave :) i would love to see how this goes up against a kited out zephyrus g15 or something in that level that would cost the same price
Can the HDMI output 3008x1692 scaled resolution? My M1 Mac Mini cannot and it’s frustrating
Everything is good when you go thick ~Dave
holy shit ur 40
The lack of hdmi 2.1 is such a finook move for a $2000+ laptop. Will wait a year for the next ones. Definitely want one a 16 incher. Microsoft ruined the surface line up and back to mac I go.
4:20 can’t stop watching it. I’m dying laughing 🤣
Dave is the Razer Blade 14 better than the MacBook 14
wait.. he is 40 !!!
Premier works great on M1 Max MacBook Pro !  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ftU1HzBKd5Y&t=793s
Second that. Depends on the use case, if it's only for simple use case, then I am confidently recommend the M1. But for Pros, they definitely know what they could have to make their work much more efficient.
"they're really cool, but they are tools, that's all they are." very good advice!
Remember when we would joke about apple putting pro and max in the name??
Thick or THICC?
You're 40?? I thought you were 18 or something.
"there's no way apple would put a webcam of this quality in their device in 2021" apple in 2020: "Guys, we can't use this webcam that we've used for a decade in our macbook pro after this year"
Bloom? What bloom?
how dare you be 40. you 25 forever. period
Dave, can you give your reactions on the new m2 macbook air please!
mac user being happy about black apple stickers and hdmi... what times to be alive
Thick design 🤢
WHAT? I THOUGHT YOU'RE YOUNG!!!!
The most insane part of this review is the fact that he's 40
That last part is something most people will ignore but it’s really important.. it’s a tool, don’t spend more than you need to
40! Heck yeah!
I get the argument for the webcam... But I don't think pros were asking for it. If given the option I bet they'd rather not have a bezel even if it meant getting a 720p camera. You aren't gonna take pictures with it so it's not really a loss
30”
Whoa the screen looks huge when seen like this.
Goddamn dime a dozen paid influencer marketing whore  tech tubers!!  🤢Get  to the meat of it man! Or point everyone to a real qualified reviewer say at Anandtech or somewhere else ! Test the damn  GPU out with full 8K or 4k  real-time previews of a video editing timeline. in Resolve or  After Effects  app!  and see if it stutters or drops  a ton of frames! Time a render job against a new flagship Intel CPU  or the last gen M1  with effects stabilization,  transitions HDR,   etc all added  at native 4K or 8K!!  Then post a real review not some BS hype train ad and  ball licking  video.
Anyone know where I can find the jacket/hoodie Dave's wearing?
u can not be 40 men I am 25 and you look much younger than me!
40?
wtf? you're 40?
I need a new laptop and want to get into designing full time and working remotely. Would the 16-inch M1 Pro 1TB storage model suffice? Or am I overreaching hahah.
Selling two black pro stickers $999 each ❗️
"Everything is good when you go THICC" - truer words have never been spoken.
Dave I am running a 2019 16" MBP. As a technical user I am happy not having the notch since I use the camera only in Micosoft Teams with 720p/HD video conferencing. The most annoying thing is the boot time what is approx 1 minutes for me. Unlike windows MacOS wait for all application(s) to start up correctly. You know windows uses the fire and forget model. So the one thing I may interested in if the so called neural engine is supported by TensorFlow. If not I wont see any any advantage of the upgrade.
You’re 40 ?!?? Man you look much younger
Bro what did apple do to this guy ? he's so passive aggressive
@1:17 that's what she said
The guy is 40 ?! you look young daaayum
Summing up the comment section: - they are expensive and best used as tools - Dave saying the "thicc" word - Dave is 40 years old (and yes, he looks half his age lol)
"Bloom! What Bloom? I don't see it"
I would wait another year for Apple to improve it.
what is the typing website when you testing the keyboard?
everything is good when you go thick. - Dave
he's 40 hory shet
The fact that everyone is commenting more about your age than de macbook is another reason to wait for the next gen.
For a second I thought we lost Dave loool watch till the end !
@dev2d Can anyone please confirm, if M1 Max MacBook can support 144hz refresh rate on external monitor?
Can anyone please confirm, if M1 Max MacBook can support 144hz refresh rate on external monitor?
Dave: I'm 40 Comment section: Oh no!
he's 40???
Did you get high when making this video? You’re chattering like a teenage girl with a limited vocabulary gone off script. You’re usually not like this. You usually have a well written script.
Is it just me or was he being sarcastic at the start ?
Dave's final thoughts are soo wise. Thanks pal 🙂
Why not just go oled and stop beating around the bush lol
My man of culture watches Kurtzgesagt!
You're 40?! I don't believe it.

Dave - I'm in a quandary and was hoping you could help. I have a laptop for my office work and I wanted one more for my home - not so much for office work continuity as for watching Netflix and playing games (like flight simulator 2020). I was looking for a slim ultra book at a max price of usd 1100. Any suggestions?
HE IS 40???????????
put 3080 benchmark or i will unsubscribe
“They are tools, thats what they are”
the fact when you realize dave is 40 is just shocking , i had to rewined just to check byt maan he sure looks young
you are WHAT
how come nobody in the comments noticed the kurzgesagt reference at 2:45?
That final point is exactly right: too many people buy these things and use them to write papers and check their email.
Good last point.  Some people get the pro just to websurf...
Everything's good when you go thick.
2:04 Oh please, Apple just gave us, JUST NOW in 2021, an "upgrade" to 1080p. Trying to use webcam quality as an excuse for the notch, ESPECIALLY when the reason for the notch in iPhone is the Face ID, which this laptop does *not* have, is a horrible, horrible excuse that holds no water.
FORTY?! I thought this dude was like 27
Dave love your reviews! Detailed and fair which is hard to fine. As a MacBook owner who holds on to them for 5-6 years before handing them down to family, I wonder what your thoughts are on future proofing these new MacBooks related to pro vs max, graphic cores, unified memory, and SSD sizing? I would not be concerned if the ports get new versions or Face ID is added in future MacBooks.

"Everything's good when you go thick." -Dave2D, 2021
Dave is it possible if you can demonstrate or someone in your team machine learning in Mac book pro and Max in python, for the Pro and Max. I need to see how fast and how much data it could handle especially ultra big data e.g. 60GB say using NYC Taxi limousine dataset for example.  I want to know which MacBook to buy, all the videos are focusing on photographers, video editors but how about data engineers? I do not use GPU unless it was using CUDA technology. Data Engineers need a versatile laptop with more on RAM, SSD and Bandwidth speed which Python and R programming uses. I have a Macbook pro retina display using it for .....10 YEARS and its on its last legs especially with big data, yes use the cloud but with sensitive data... No Way. ....I never had to use my MacBook pro intensively only until the last 3 years as that's where I started using this for Data Science and boy it served me well like brand new. That was the second most expensive model. So far no one has done a video blog for aiming for data engineers specifically, only video editors, gamers, and photographers. There is a niche and it is overlooked. This is where many coders want a review, Facebook and Google are spending money in this industry on ML and AI
-Like for me, I am 40 years old. -Damn! ... -I am sorry...
The old man voice was really good
you are 40? WHAT
I hope that the video editing process will be much smoother than in my 2020 M1

“Everything is good if you go thicc”
Apple is idiots!  Now the question is - if they force everyone to remake all the software under the bangs, then what will we see on the MacBook screens without bangs?  Tabs in the browser with gaps under the bangs?  Those.  They do not test their "crafts" anymore?  I would agree if they removed the cameras from the laptops altogether !!!  This is in their style and is justified, because  all have smartphones and few people use laptop cameras ..... But doing this is a disgrace and bastardness !!!!
WHAT DAVE IS 40 NOW? ._.
"everything is good when you go thick"
apple fanboy. That notch is so horrible but still he managed to depend it. How about developers using studios, browsers.. I guess we can resize them to stay below notch.
whats sad is that people are still gonna waste money and just use it to brows face book and text their friends on instagram. you know that there are people out there like that. and its sad
mmmm that charger cord is going to get grimy fast. exactly what they want to happen. ever notice that its harder to keep apple stuff clean than other stuff? they do that on purpose to incentivize you  into getting another...
its amazing that apple actually made a laptop this time instead of a mac
1:17 That's what she said.
cant use windows and now its even bigger with no touch bar
Just picked up the base model 14inch at my local best buy. Oh I love it so much. Being able to edit 4k 10bit HEVC codec in real time is so nice. I got the good good.

Hey, Dave, enjoyed the review especially your honest comment about how outrageously expensive they are. I'm due for an upgrade and I'm looking at a loaded 16" about $4200. What I love is how well they are built. I actually still use a Macbook Pro 17" loaded and upgraded with an SSD, but, it's time to move on because the OS is getting real old on this one. My 17" was also loaded. I paid $3500 for it, years ago. The way I justified it, then, was Boot Camp. I have a lot of Windows software (to replace the software would be expensive) so, I do a lot of video/audio rendering on the Windows side with Vegas and Sound Forge Pro and other tools. For the reason of performance, I did not go virtual with Parallels and just used the MAC as a Windows computer booting into it and it's been great. I also don't like how the new Parallels is a subscription, so, to create a Windows virtual out of Parallels, I'd have to pay $100 a year forever and when the price goes up, even more, just for the privilege of using my Windows virtual. So, my question is, all this mentioned, I justified the large expense of the Mac 17" because it was 2-computers in 1. I didn't need a 2nd high end Windows computer. Now, if I buy the new MAC, obviously I have to deal with Parallels and a subscription, which sucks, but, here's the dealbreaker. Will Parallels give me the performance in virtual running intensive programs like CAD, Vegas, Sound Forge, etc. or will I be disappointed. I even have old Adobe software I bought when it was sold that still works great. So, will I be disappointed in virtual running those kind of programs or will I also have to consider replacing all that older software which really makes this a dealbreaker.  What do you think? I really don't want refurbished, but, I guess I could find a loaded 16" with that intel processor that would last several years, too. Or, I could just say, "see ya later" and just buy a loaded Dell XPS 17" or even a Dell Workstation model and it will run all my Windows stuff and just move on? What do you think? No matter what I do, I am going to have to run some Windows programs. I just have too many programs in Windows to just replace everything and go MAC, but, I do love Final Cut and having both operating systems and the benefits of syncing with IPAD, a phone and all of that but, the prices are just insane. The other thing that is so frustrating is the older Macbook Pro 17" was fully upgradable. It didn't come maxed out on RAM or with an SSD and I was able to get in the game for $3500 and upgrade the machine, later on. With the memory not being able to be upgraded anymore, you have no choice but to go all the way when you buy it. After all, I don't want to get 16gig ram or 32gig ram or a 500gig hard drive and then kick myself because I can't uprade it and have to buy a new computer. Really sucks they way they design them so they cannot be upgraded later. If you buy a new car and you want to add an accessory or upgrade the stock OEM tires, you can. But, not on a MAC. Anyway, your thoughts appreciated.
These new MacBook are giving me 2015 MacBook Pro vibes with new M1 tech
Great Video
40??? These asians are doing something right here I thought he was like early 30’s at the most
Damn forget the laptop  They way I know that is pro is the black sticker
double  like for last comment... just perfect!
Anyone noticed that NF's video clip! 🔥
Everything's good if you're going thicc 😂😁
This dude's 40?? He just looks like your typical stressed college student.
Who gives a shit about the stickera
Is 64gb Overkill?
for a college student who isn't doing graphic design or anything similar, this is overkill. m1 air the best option
wait this isnt your full time job? This channel your hobby? if so sheesh im curious what your main job is
What is the app you use for test your writing skill at 4:38? :D
Dave and his family watching the BTS concert is the cutest thing ever lmaoo
Overall, what has surprised me is that you’re forty.
as asian .. i knew it dave is 40.. hahaha..
DAVE YOU'RE 40??!!!!! YOU LOOK 28
Is the price difference worth it?... I can get a M1 2020 for 1100 plus taxes, this is almost 2x the price and upper models, 3x....
Dude... 3060 like performance in an APU... Like WHAT?!
“They are really cool, but they’re tools. That’s what they are”  Dave talking about cringe TikTokers.
MAN'S GETTING THEM HEADSHOTS LIKE IT'S NOTHING!
how on earth is he 40
Very good review! I was mind-blown by the new chip, I was ready to see whether I can purchase this but Dave reminded me that these are just tools. Love the fact that Dave keeps it real!
Not sure if you were kidding about the stickers or not
Great video under 10 mins. Well put. No wonder he had over 3 m subs. He deserved it. Clear to the point honest opinion
I was curious to find out if these MBPs have "facial tracking thing", aka Apple term "Center Stage". From my research on the specs, it looks like the answer is NO! Since it is possible to fit it on an 8 inch iPad mini without notch, why can't Apple do it on the 14/16 inch MBP with notch? I know the 24 inch iMac also doesn't have it, but why?
Gotsta love Apple for giving themselves props for bringing back the ports that they were responsible for taking away.
Did he say he's 40 😂😂 I still felt he is way younger than mkbhd
"everything is good when you go thick" :)
The design is terrible!  It's as thick as a brick (10 years old design)!  He has bangs.  (Are you serious? Could you make the top frame a little bigger? I waited and wanted to buy, but it looks like a Chinese fake.
They can go for puch hole camera.. notch really looks ugly now 🤦
wait... hold up... you're 40?     I don't believe you.
Going to be interesting to see how this sells. Apple has basically caved on peoples claims of wanting function over form, but this looks like a laptop from 10 years ago.
No Dave, you're not 40, stop messing with us.
is there butterfly keyboard?
Is that a nr200p at the back?
FaceID works on iPhones because double tapping the power button to confirm things is OK. On a laptop it makes no sense touch ID is faster and you can just push it to confirm whereas if it had faceID youd still have to push something to confirm transactions etc
YOU'RE 40?!
all have orgasm form new MacBook.... Me who knows that my mobile RTX 3070 faster in 4 time for all GPU workflows........  And my PTX3060 TI in 10 times.....
There's a little bit of kurzgesagt in the video
Dave, love your videos. But you can actually slow down a bit. I actually thought I was watching at 1.25x with this vid. I actually wanna hear and process what you're saying
You look like you're 25!!!!!
ill go for a poor quality webcam than notch
Laptop with a noch, jesus
grandpa voice 🤣
God The design Is god awfu!
I hear there's a new Premier release which takes better advantage of the new MacBook Pros 😳.  These new MacBook Pros aren't really more expensive than the 2019 versions at the top end. A MacBook Pro 16", M1 Max w/32 GPU cores, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD is cheaper than a 2019 MacBook Pro 16", core-i9 2.6ghz, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M w/8 GB, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD - and you get a _lot_ more.  These things are powerful - not radioactive. You won't be collecting roentgens by using them - you won't be Rhysling  scoring _The Green Hills of Earth_ in Logic Pro.  I don't remember anyone warning people away from the 2019 MacBook Pro - but maybe I missed it.  Between the speed, energy efficiency, batter bittery life, gorgeous displays, ports, and SPEED these are probably the best laptops around. And if someone attacks you you can whack 'em over the head with one and perform a field frontal labotomy (so they're good for self-defense too).
Now dave clearly become apple fan boy now!
10/10 Dave best grandpa.
hey Dave, indeed your reviews are rational that's why we really wait for your review before any purchase decision. you are always honest.  i would like to give you one honest review, your new studio looks/ gives feeling of  confined, suffocating space. you have already changed the set up too many times since moving into new studio. one advice which may help, please shot in such a way that ceiling and ceiling with back wall merge line would not visible.
Dave dropping reality check on compulsive shopping, great guy.
An expensive laptop won't make you happy
I was today years old when i realized that you are 40
Huge respect for keeping real at the end man.
The more I learn about these, the more disappointed I am :/
Fuc"ing Notch OCD Triggered 😂😂
Everything is good when you go thick. You my friend have won the internet for me.
how do these laptops do crunching through 40MP photos in LR and PS?
Found your videos looking for info on the zenbook duo. We are the same age and I really like that you are to the point and easy to follow. Subbed and going through your old vids as well. Mahalo and have a wonderful day 🌺
Which was the type test app?
Dude you are not a minute older than 29. Come on!
The look of shame when you admitted “my family was watching a BTS concert” 😅😅😅😅😂😇
wait you can play overwatch on Macs?!
Please stop justifying the notch, nobody wants a notch on a macbook
Everything was going great until he told he's 40, like seriously I am Shocked!!!
Just wanna say... (1) love your videos... literally all good stuff and not a bunch of theatrics, ads, etc... (2) love your humor... several times.. I literally laughed out loud lol... and (3)... you're 40?! I'd keep that a secret.. I would have guessed no more than 30! Keep up the awesome work and never change!! :)
Excuse me you're 40? In what, dog years?  Dude you look 30 at best!
8:08 most important ending sentences
You are 40?
I’m an After Effects, Premiere, and Cinema4D user and seems like though this is a beast of a machine, I may not benefit off of it?! I do not use Final Cut nor do I care to. Lol
everything is better when it's thiccc
= 30” I feel offended
Wait Dave is 40 I thought he was like 32
Love this guy in “how to get away with murder”
I see the aesthetic and edge profile is a throw-back of the 1st gen Intel MBPS (or the last-gen PPC G5 PBs), along with bringing back the ports, it kind of fits the retro-theme of this generation really well.
Ok. Now Apple finally gave Dave the new MacBook to review
Dave's 40. Feel old yet.
Thanks for telling me I don’t need it. I was about to impulse buy one
most windows pc from 2016 still beat this
I still like my MB2018 15" base model. The new macbook pro is crazy good but the price is too much money!
Loved the closing statement.
That slither.io clutch against a big slither proves how good the trackpad really is
Damn that last sentence was really humbling
"Everything is good when you go thick"
The main issue is always the limited selection of software (including games).
How is the typing web/app called?
You don't look 40 lol
i dont know how to make a comment that doesnt sound like im apple bashing. pls dont take it that way, but half this video is talking about how great features that apple removed are (hdmi port, function buttons, sd card reader. what year is this where you're impressed by a laptop having an hdmi port?). where was this side of the apple community when they were removing all these things in the first place?
fanboy review. Do a review. Not make excuse for everything that is wrong. Apple have their own PR department. btw. is a good laptop
Thanks for the great review Dave! I don't need these as a professional (I use a Windows device given by the work place) but as a multimedia powerhouse. I bought the 14 inch one, and I love the screen and sound quality. I really dislike using Windows, and older MBP and Air models don't have the display quality and sound capabilities of the new model. I can even use Sennheiser HD660S high impedance headphones without needing an external amplifier. So yes, they are tools, but they are also amazing multimedia laptops.
You're 40?! Man... Give us the secret!
What’s so crazy about Apple silicon is that the base model MacBook Air all the way at the bottom of the lineup is already so good that it’s more than capable enough for a huge portion of “pro” users. You really have to know a specific usecase the M1 won’t cut it for if you need these new machines. I’ve been so tempted by these just because they’re nice, but my M1 mini already has so much headroom in my workflow that trying to justify it is just silly.
Great video. Especially liked the message at the end. Most people really dont need it, myself included. However, I'm a web developer who uses a very old mbp and I'd really like to upgrade soon. Why does apple assume that a "pro" user is someone who does heavy graphics or video rendering? I'd like a new mbp with a larger display (13" is very limiting sometimes) but this offering is just way overpowered for my needs. I hope they release cheaper versions with more mid-range chips for other kinds of "pro" users.
40?????????????
Last line is fire 🔥 !!! If you really need it then go for it !!! If not then better stay with old machine whatever you have !!!
MANS CANT BE 40 OK EDWARD CULLEN
40 wow my guess would be 27 - 31
God that intro was cool 😂
Wait you are 40!!! You looks 25 -30 to me.
They look the same every year        GREY
Camera is not problem, thick is cool, graphics can into some old games and it's so cool for $4k laptop. That's how payed reviews look like.
4:37 what typing test is that?
They are very expensive rubbish. Till now Apple could not make a laptop with a touch screen and all of their laptops since the first one look the same 😂😂😂
Dude they look so outdated. Design legitimately looks like 2005 macbook and I really hate it lol. I am a light user, I need some beef on my machine, but nothing an intel macbook pro can't handle. Only thing I wish I had is the battery life. But holy hell.. new macbooks look so fucking bad.

Please review LG gram
the notch is a fucking mistake. will never buy it now
"I love thicc" - i don't use laptop but this is so relatable
This is a pro pro laptop like if you are semi pro it’s just too much for you. You have to be a pro
I wonder what changes they'll make to the MacBook Air so that it's not just a basic browser, but for people who'll use macbook's heavily, but aren't creative professionals?
Would these new macbook pros preferable for architecture students? like for architecture softwares such as sketchup,revit,autocad,photoshop,lumion,etc they all run better on windows than in a mac, but after the massive performance hype these new macbook pros got, will they be able to run and be better machines for architecture?????
I want the airs to be in colors and have an updated processor.
DAVE IS 40 ?!
Graphic are no where no 3080 when gaming.
WHAT THE FFFFF YOUR 40????
What? YOu're 40? You look barely 32 to me. Good job with skincare, man =))
How much does Apple 🍎 spend on those YouTubers?!
Jesus, I thought you were younger than me and I'm 29.
BLOOOOOOMMMM
Did he just say he’s 40? I would have guessed late 20s
sir please give me one laptop sir i am poor student in India sir for studying LLB
Good review. I would've loved to see the gaming review for a bit longer.
they look like a razor laptop
You get a like for having a Kurzgesagt video in your video
Speechless! No way dude's 40
adobe premiere doesn't bother to optimize for any apple hardware
I thought you were in your late 20s early 30s you look really really good for 40
“They are tools”… sure they aren’t for everyone and people shouldn’t feel pressured to go drop big coin on a product they don’t need.   Just funny how this seems the way to attack these MacBooks since they lack any real flaws. I don’t hear anyone saying you don’t really need to drop 2K on these decked out PC gaming laptops saying, “ just gaming machines.”   While I don’t disagree in principal it just comes off like PC laptop makers saying, “tone it down if you want to keep getting these demo units.”
I think I am going to keep up with my 13' MBP 2020
“I’m 40, right?” Bro…GTFOH. Seriously?
Did I hear you say 40? Mahn you look 25.
What about the speed on Davinci Resolve? Really curious to see how it handles fusion.
My girlfriend just left me for thicc M1. It's not m fault I'm hung like windows.
“ Everything is good when you go THICC “  Dave Lee 2021.
You're 40????????? 🤯😱
I’ve bought the 16” version and I absolutely love it. First MBP was bought in 2015, second the touch bar model in 2018. 2015 model felt like a tank, a real professional tool, loved it. 2018 Touch Bar model was really nice, but had lost the “tank like feel”, felt flimsy and I hated the keyboard. This is a real return to what a MBP should be, an absolute tank of a machine that you can depend   on. I’m a web developer so don’t need blistering performance, I just need a workhorse. The MagSafe charging is a real unexpected bonus, one of the USB ports broke on my touch bar model. This feels like it’s been designed by engineers, not designers. (No offence to designers, design is very important).
40?!?!
Loved the last part. Thank you for the dose of reality!
The design looks like a 2007 HP notebook. Thick and bland!
I can not tell the difference between you and uncle Roger
She thicc
Still waving your freaking hands like a moron, huh?
U r 40! My whole life was a lie
You dont look 40. I thought you are in your mid 20s! Lol!
How do you play Overwatch on mac?
bloom? what bloom?
Fuxk the review, damn you're 40? No way
Eeeh I think you’re being too nice. Yeah it’s a cool device, but saying "it doesn’t need HDMI 2.1 because it’s not meant to be connected to the best screens" ... come on. You said it yourself, this is a PRO device for PROS. Pros need great HDMI connections.   Also, the notch... there are already reports that the menus in the menu bar do not correctly float around the notch as advertised – and even if they do, and the menu is long (as is often the case with professional applications), it hides menu bar icons, which are often essential. The notch is a horrible design decision. And I don’t buy the "dell only could make the camera small because it’s 720p" thing. This doesn’t make much of a difference. There are 4k cameras in tiny phones too. Maybe they have something planned for which they need more processing power at that place in the future, and they plan to keep this design for a long time. Maybe face ID, whatever. But this much space is not necessary just so the camera can be 1080p.
Everythings good when its thikk !!!
Dude you're 40, you're 25 in earth
MI : Hmmm Notch..!! Hold my Xinjiang Black Beer ....👌🏼🤙🏼
HE'S 40??!?????
Apple targetting a wrong cust group
"every thing is better when you go THICC"
30
That's it? the most revolutionary Apple laptops in a decade, and this is the review? :D its like you just had a few hours left before rushing somewhere and had to upload this FAST!
Bruh is that a fking notch
My flex is that i own the black apple sticker😂
guys, what's the game on 4:50? thanks
Man’s watching the BATMAN trailer! RESPECT
are we gonna ignore how he defeted the giant snake in slither.io just by using trackpad?
40 ???
I think you reached your peak with the intros
The violet army naturally form because ghana daily avoid modulo a outgoing bottle. guiltless, detailed mini-skirt
Bro your 40?!
You are 40? 😳
Wait you're 40?
I screwd up for getting m1 12 inch for like a small difference in price, i jumped the gun 4 months earlier :(
2:44 @kurzgesagt
You're 40!!! I'm 22 and you look my age!!
The front camera is so good I spot some salt and pepper on Dave's hair for the first time lol.
People really be acting like apple did something, when in reality they merely re added MagSafe and a few ports. Wow. Are consumers this stupid? Apple literally just took something away and gave it back and people are really out here thinking apple did something groundbreaking.
Thanks i was about to buy one of these. I should stick to m1
I disagree with your statement on 2:10 since the older macbook models used a 720p camera. Besides that, nice video. Keep up the good work!
“Everything’s better when you go thicc”
are you sure m1 max isn't better than windows in premier? The Verge is saying it's the fastest they've tested in premiere
Dammmmmmmm..... Black stickers...... No way..... Take my kidney and liver😂😂😂
YOU'RE 40??????? GOALS! Im trying to look like you in 10 years.
Everything's good when you go thicc! --Dave 2021.  I agree.
"They are really cool, but  they are just tools, thats all they are"
Quite happy with my M1 MacBook Air.  Before, I had to get the Pro.  Now, the Air is plenty fast for my needs
What ..he is 40 ..he does not look more than 25
everythings good when you go thick
Hello Dave2D, can you make a performance review , please
A wise men once said : ”everything is good when you go thick”
"They're really cool, but... they're tools. That's all they are."  All reviews should end with this caveat!
liked that u had to clear it up that people don't need this unless they actually use it as a tool!
But can it run Crysis?
Why in the United States the macbook pro 14 "m1 pro cost 2000 $ and in France the same M1 pro cost 2249 €?  The dollar and the euro are the same and even the euro costs more than the dollar.  So how and why 249 € more in France, with France always a little theft by the way
TIME TO DEEPFRY WITH ULTIMATE EFFICIENCY
Bruv your closing thoughts just stuck me good 🔥🔥❤️
A very good & honest review, cheers!  Also, how on earth are you looking better at 40 than I am at 21 ?!?!?!?
I really don't care about the notch, if it had faceid....
You get free stickers, but a cloth from apple is 25 dollars. Why not keep the stupid stickers, and put in there a free cleaning cloth, since you already spent a fortune on that machine?!
Apple fan boys spend 3-4 K on a laptop and get excited about a set of stickers. What a mindfuck
"Everything's good when you go thicc..." 😏
My employer pays for the laptop anyway, so fk em and make em pay for the most expensive one
Fish at the background: Dave forget about ARM topic?  7s later "Did he forget... Huh whatever..."
I can’t believe you are 400000!!!!!!!!! U don’t look a day pass 300000!!!!!
1:17 I  genuinely agree with you!
Really appreciate the "you probably don't need this" at the end. Pragmatic. Similar to the message you gave in the back to school buyers guide iirc.
Wondering if you did a Blender 3D test?
You are 40? U look 24
“They are cool but they are tools” Only if I follow this, I could save thousands of $$$
"Coz its thick I love thickness "
“They are really cool, but they are tools” best advice I have heard from a while, thanks Dave for yr honest review & advice.
♥️ Great advice at the end Dave. But as a non-creator .. 16” base model was calling my name AND I succumbed 🤷🏽‍♀️. Amazing for watching videos. If only there were a BIGGG, cheaper non-pro machine 🤣.
That rounded bottom design irks me. Previous generation Macbook had a very polished clean look.
Your conclusion regarding whether to buy or not — nailed it. Great review. Thx!
You’re 40?
One more truthful and straight to the point review, also very denser information of a video. Truth to be told, pretty much all the bleeding edge, latest and greatest are beyond what 90% of the whole population need. Heck even a chromebook may suffice a majority of our computing needs.
"They're really cool but they are tools, that's all they are"
bro my brother just bought this for university do write word documents and do excel spreadsheets from time to time. man's just blew his money
4:50 What a Legend.
I was going on planning to purchase because :new new hardware: but that last take was pretty good. They're too expensive and they're just tool. Cool video!
Went to this apple store today to see them in person. Got it out of my system. I don’t need it. I want it, but don’t need it.
please god do not make trackpads any bigger unless they’re literally just going to be the entire palm surface. it’s getting absurd at this point
There is no way you are 40 man !!! if you ask me i would say you are 26 or something like this 😂😂
Remember when they removed the ports?
40??
Im more suprised by the age more than the mac
bruh your 40? i thought you were early 30s
You're 40? 😮
U are brave. Im 31, but im feel ashamed to tell my age, couse i look 17.
I think the fact remains that the baseline M1 devices are more than good enough for >95% of consumers
I like that you are not a apple shill like you-know-who apple fanboy channel. Seriously considering this but your ending really brought me down to earth.
HES FORTY?! No cracks
"Everything's good when you go thiccc." - Dave, 2021
hey Dave I wanted to mention that your last sentence was really right and awesome! these are good tools but not cheap! And not for everyone since apple mostly care about money making. in 2017 I really wanted a Mac book did not care if its used laptop or not , one day I was alone I started to think its really really expensive for me (Mac book T2 I mean) finally I bought a Asus n552vw. this was a decision that I could make again.
Do you know if they finally got rid of the retina stains and screen coating losses issues?
The decisive fiberglass concurringly blot because richard optionally rinse across a overt top. lively, dreary view
Very helpful review and sensible recommendations, exactly what I expect from a 40-year-old, even though you don't look it at all.
Is it only me who thinks these have become somewhat uglier or less good looking? Looks are one of the most important thing for MacBooks. DELL XPS looks much better now. Also miss the touch bar. I liked it so much. Also it made them look better.
Honestly that ".. I'm 40" was a real bomb drop. oh.. great video by the way.
I remember a month ago I commented about Dave is getting old. Aged just fine
what, WHAT WHY IS THERE A NOTCH ON A DAMN MACBOOK
I'm there with ya Dave. My eyes at 40 can see $hit. My developer career will be over soon if my eyes get any worse.
Dafuq you're 40..f that I'm 32 and I look older than you son..
Hello
It's nice but it wouldn't make me change from my Dell XPS 15 OLED
Did he said, he is 40??? 😲😲😲i used to think Dev is someone who finished his college just a few years ago😂😂😂man!  you look younger than me and i am 22😂😂😂😂for today the matrix has broken 😂😂😂😂
DAMN that notch is beyond STUPID AF!
Great advice at the end there.
I think the last comment is a perfect summary of these new machines. They are tools, and they do specific things really well. If you’re a professional who makes a living doing the specific tasks these machines were built for, you absolutely can’t beat the package that Apple has released here. If that doesn’t describe you, the M1 Air from 2020 is still an absolute banger of a general-use laptop
Yoooo NF! The Search is an amazing song!
did he just casually said he's 40 ? though you were 30 art max
Dave's hoodies are always the best
He's 40 ..what ??
Can you test water resistance with those thicc bois on your fish tank behind after we all knows they are "just tools" ? Thanks.
Like for the last part... "They are tools"..
What a sh...t is on the top of the screen???? YEAH!!!
Apple taking something away and then giving it back and people are going crazy about the ports
It don’t reduce render times on premiere pro and after effects. Nuff said.
And why do people use face ID this much, like tf. You literally scanning your face to a server, multiple times every single day. And then complain against these companies when it comes to the data they store , use & sell? Can you just not do that then/>
I don't like je square shaped product design, reminds me too much of my Macbook Pro 2010. When they had welding issues and after 2 years still didn't wanted to fix our MacBook pro's.
I see you watch Kurzgesagt @ 2:40. A man of culture
Top honest review, thank you
It's official, Dave DOES NOT AGE.
no wayyyy this guy is 40 !!!
WAIT´, YOU are 40 ?????? i Thought you were 25 or something
I look like 38. I'm 25
Dave's 40?! Looks 20 to me
He looks like 20 🤯
Does the Parallels VM for Windows work on these new MacBooks? I know it was not supported on the M1 macBooks that came last year!
omg you're 40???? you look very young
Dear Dave, as a company we use Premiere exhaustively; can you clarify two things for us: *You've said the editing on Premiere isn't superior with the Windows competition; but is the Premiere performance on par with rival workstation laptops or subpar? Does the M1 Max utilize Mercury real time rendering technology at all?*
It's really neat seeing the direction Apple is taking with their laptops, but I really hate that notch. I never did, nor will I ever purchase a smartphone with a notch or hole-punch cut out in the display and that same philosophy holds true for laptops as well. I really hope this move from Apple doesn't push other manufacturers to do the same thing like it did in the smartphone space. In all honesty, Apple's influence over the tech space is the only thing I hate about them and that's not even their fault, but I hate it. Thankfully, I don't believe that Apple influence reaches into the laptop space as much as it does with smartphones, but I guess only time will tell with this recent move from them.
Talk more about the black apple stickers and less about the notch with fullscreen apps please
it's crazy how you're almost 41.  thought i was older..
Dave, you're my favourite youtuber, your reviews and your videos are by far the simplest and the cleanest, no bs. I've been following you for five years now, you're awesome, just wanted to say that.
I’m a 21 year old and as a guy who runs around the YouTube pile whenever a new tech comes out as a fun pastime, it can get really tempting to buy something I don’t need. You saved me hours of second guessing. Thanks Dave!
No way Dave looks 40 I thought he was in his late 20s or early 30s
2:41 Kurzgesagt
dude, you look 20.
Web cam of xps and this looks the exact same......
aruku lo dola steps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhY7cVYWPog
Man u look way younger than 40  Like under 35
Hey Dave, will there be a Macbook air version with these chips in near the future?
The quality of the webcam of mac books pro previous models was so inferior, now, we have that notch - but a better cam... if i could choose: no cam at all, or cam like dell, it does not matter. So i Choose: no new MBP with notch - it's that simple - and i could have afforded it easily
Awesome video as always.
Black Apple Stickers 😂😂😂
Wait so you can game now on mac? wat
Hi Dave, which software you are using for testing keyboard(4:36 in the video)? I want to try that out too. Look forward to hear from you soon.
how much are you getting paid to shill apple products? unsubscribed
You don’t look 40 to me. :)
What was that app at 4:34 ！？
I recall your Macbook Pro 16 inch in the freezer video. Yes, M1 pro/max chips are powerful, but they are alos in a bigger chassis. What if an intel Macbook Pro 16 in a thicker chassis? Would it be as powerful as the new M1 chips?
FCP is twice as fast as premier though
2:19 most likely due to one of the sensors of TrueDepth system is actually thicker than the MBP's lid?
I always used to think you are in your late 20s. Man 40 that was like a jaw-dropping revelation to me lmao.  Your ending note was so beautiful. 'They are just tools' ✨
watching this with my apple tablet i love technologies and youtubers i always enjoying to watch when i have a time to know their products
Dave: I'm 40... Us: 30, take it or leave it
40???
If I didn't know any better I'd think the original M1 Macbook Air was the "new" model and these were the old.
Dave was weirdly energetic through out the video. And I like it. and btw, he does not look like 40
My eyes are begging for 16” screen even though I have no workflow that can benefit from powerful chips.
I wanna see a new macbook air
Whats going on at 6:58 ? Why there is a green part on a video
Apple design team, what’s old is new again
you like thick and black.
His closing speech is a sage advice regarding impulse buying and buyers. Because the 2021 MacBook Pro is shiny, new, and tempting.
Still there is no fish
I thought you were late 20s lol.
Is this guy payed by Apple?
You think your eyes are dim now, kid? Just wait. :P
Youre such a shill brother.
He makes a really good grandpa voice
wait...dave is FUCKING FORTY?  im 26 and I look worse
may i know where can i find the green wallpaper pleaseeeee
Wait you're 40??? Damn you look younger. 👌🏻
But can it handle Roblox?
If you told me you were 10 years younger, I'd believe you
Loved the last part
Da Vinci resolve works well on them to. Premier just sucks, can’t wait to get out of my creative cloud contract.
In 20 years these will be useless tools.. but until then I’ll take 2 ✌️
4:56 It's not like Audeze LCD yet?!?
Great video as always, very funny as well) keep up the good work Dave. Thanks
The anxious condition postsurgically scorch because disgust dentsply whip a a fragile antarctica. large, amusing creature
Are you 40?? Really??
For apps that have a lot of menu items on the menu bar (i.e. Android Studio sorry only example i know), would the notch cover those text (usually toward the end, like "Window" or "Help" text) or would they automatically be relocated to the right of the notch?
Dave’s grandpa voice is on point !!
Finally the MacBook PRO is actually made for professionals and it's not just a naming gimmick
And here I am thinking he was 30.
Wait dave is 40????
The video is the wrong resolution
Needed to hear that last part
40.nahhh....you look like 24 or something. What's your secret!
Sometimes it's necessary to run Parallels/WindowsOS on a Mac for a particular piece of software used, e.g. Revit...what's the performance like to do this on the new MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon) [Understand this is possible with a couple of technical work arounds] vs previous Intel based Macs?
“They are cool, but they are just tools. That’s all what they are”  Thanks for pointing that out!
You’re so honest and concise! Thank you for this video :)
4:20 you’re 40?!?
Right Dave, opinion, have a 2020 i9 16"/16gb/1tb, way to big for my needs and a beast to carry on vacation, go for a 14" M1 Pro, in reality I don't need that much power just for the rare editing/creative cloud work.
NF 5:05
Pre-Order Pre-Order Pre-Order Pre-Order Pre-Order Pre-Order Pre-Order NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE!  IMHO
Wait a, minute you are 40 ' ! Am thinking late 20s, atleast the green hood matches that.
Waiting on the normal pro update for the peasant me that can’t afford the 2k asking price of these. I can surely use some normal ports and throw out all those dongle nonsense.
Should have gone to town on that stupid blob on the screen Dave.  It's not ok, it's a worse decision than the touchbar.
dave WHAT THE F mann how are you 40?! EDIT: wanted to give a thumbs up for a great honest review, as always.
Hey Dave, Regarding the Xcode benchmarks, can some clarify for me why GPU cores matters here ? as far as I know the CPU will be doing all the work for most of the Xcode projects unless you are building a game, so I'm curious of M1 Pro vs M1 Max (both 10 cores) Xcode build benchmarks.
Love your conclusion <3
dude the end statement sum it all, iam probably more excited to have a 3060 Laptop XMG to replace my HP Omen 1070 MaxQ, than this, of course it's beyond exciting, but realistically if i have 4 grands, do i burn it on that, i don't think so .. iam excited for a 3060 laptop because it's way more smarter purchase than that .. will fill up 95 per cent of what i can do with a M1 Max, and you could buy a lot more stuff .. an external GPU, a Pixel 6 .. a nice camera .. for wealthy people go for it, for mere mortals, definitely not ..
Dave 2D is best when it comes to reviewing MacBooks
I want to quickly mention that at 6:12 the FPS for GFXBench seems to be the offscreen FPS, if it is onscreen the nvidia GPU's seem to have a very noticeable lead compared to the M1 Max (if choosing DirectX12, if you choose openGL the nvidia gpu's still win but by less).  I do want to mention I am not familiar with this benchmark but i know many people wont look things like these up so I thought i would mention it.
Does the body (still) give you small electric shocks?
Amazing video, as always!
You are 40? Damn you look so young
why have they left behind the intel MacBooks . sad :(
Yeah those panels are awes-    YOU’RE 40?
WOULD  HAVE BBEN GREAT IF THEY HAD ADDED ATLEAST ONE  USB A PORT.
Bro.. How is this guy 40.. If you would've asked me before today how old he was, I would have said not more than 30.
DAMN! I WAS SHOCKED WHEN YOU SAID I'M 40, I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE IN YOUR LATER 2O'S.
Great video! I did order my mac pro 16 inch M1max 64ram 2T. Long overdue upgrade from my 2015 refurbished air 😂 I do use FCPX so think I made the right choice. This was my first time watching you and subbed!
How are you 40? You look 25! Make a video about how you managed to pull this off! Amazing video tho :)
i'd rather have a bigger bezel than the ugly notch
A bit better on the port front (not so difficulty since coming from so low...) but: why no ethernet one???
how in the f are you 40 bro you look like 21
These are expensive tools if you don't use them for your professional work you don't need them, I liked the video because of the honesty
I'm surprised you gave them a pass on the HDMI port after giving a complete opposite opinion when it came to the webcam.  If they went with a crappy Dell-like webcam you could have just as easily said "it's there to be used in a pinch".  I would have preferred you stuck with demanding a professional device for professionals and criticized Apple for not doing the right thing.
Dave is Tomb Raider 6:13 is running on Rosetta right ?
I don't know what's more shocking tbh. The performance on these things, or that you're 40. You look 35 at best!
I think this Macbook actually sucks. I bought the 16 Max. It's no faster in the pro tasks that I do: CAD through Parallels virtualization. For all the talk of graphics, its just ok. It's geared to such a small band of people who are basically youtubers. Can it blow through 8K Red footage? Sure. But who really cares? 1% of people that use laptops? 1% of people that have an 8K TV? They just happen to be the most vocal because they are rendering footage of themselves talking about Macbooks. It's a ridiculous feedback loop. Apple has made a smart move catering to this group as they are all waxing poetic about the RETURN OF PORTS WOW. Any other company would have been skewered for doing the same. This thing is a chunker too. Definitely not worth the $3500. Getting returned. I'll stay with my Intel Macbook for now. We'll see what the future holds.
Wanted to point out that there was a post that explained that the geekbench score isn't as high as expected because the test isn't long enough to kick up the frequency
"Black Apple Sticker"?  ROFL... Yeah..... That's something someone who buys Apple would talk about.
I thought you were 30 or something. Frickn boomers man.
Hi Dave, Could you make a video of comparison between M1 and M1max/pro Macs.. I think it will be useful
so which one is better for battery life beetwen 13inch macbookpro m1 or 14inch macbook pro m1pro 8core or 14inh macbook pro m1pro10core? i still dont see any battery test beetwen this 3 macbook pro, because now i use i5 macbook pro touch bar and battery life is horrible...
T H I C C
he's 40 looks like 25
“I’m 40…”   What?
That last sentence is really precious! Love you man ❤️
As for the final thoughts: I DO need it. Mine is from Late 2013. This is the upgrade I've been waiting for ever since I wanted to upgrade, but didn't because... a Touch Bar and a butterfly keyboard.
I need Europa Universalis 4 and Hearts of Iron 4  benchmarks for this 🤣🤣
They're tools, that's all they're, Oh thanks god, I almost fell for those
Bro I would’ve guessed he was 30
How did you play overwatch on M1s? As fair as I know you can use Bootcamp. Great Video!
THICC 😏
1:16 "Everything's good when you go thick" Coming from an Asian dude
I don't understand why everyone hated the touchbar. I absolutely love it.
So I’m curious what Apple does with the review units once they’re returned? I’m trying to grow my channel and am shooting content in 4K but am still working on my 2014 MacBook Pro so I’m not able to render or export the footage in 4K and am curious to know whether or not they have any sort of donation program for content creators? Just a question though and maybe one day I’ll be able to actually afford one of these beasts. Great video though and have a great day✌🏽😃✌🏽
Still no USB.?????
Could have shown the negative side of the notch, but instead choose to not show the negatives and how the IU was not fixed. Or maybe you haven't really tested the Macbook to realize those issues.
too many good  laptops out there for $600-1000 all you need 4-8 cores machine. Apple? too greedy as always for 2-5k and with 1 year warranty wtf
I wish more youtubers would outright say if something is too expensive, at the end of the day they're consumer devices
"they are tools, that's all they are" summed it really well for me. Thank you for keeping the end users in mind and clearly seeing the demographic
This 2021 MacBook Pro looks so similar to the nostalgic 2006 MacBook Pro when th lip is closed - rounded , boxy, and old-fashionedly Thick !!!!   It's a salute to the classic MacBook Pro  predecessor !!
Such a great commentary at the end of the video - you don't need a super expensive tool. Though  they're fancier, newer, and therefore more tempting,  They are, in the essence, still pretty much the same tool .
How did you put Overwatch in a MacBook ?!
you are 40? I look older than you I am in 20's
Everything is good when you go thicc
They're really cool but too expensive to be a fun buy. great review!
90% of them doesnt use webcam of macbook pro if they use it will only last about couple minutes
Hey boss, in the last video you mentioned the difference of chargers for the 14"(96W) and the 16"(140W) and was wondering if you had any updates/notes on that! Cheers <3
This is exactly what it is. I really want them but do not need them.
5:30 you are just being too biased and lenient. It's a MacBook Pro. It got to support 2.1. It is designed to run on the best of studio displays, and its not like the MacBook Air to run on office.  The whole video, you are just too being Apple fanboy. I hope I can trust ya. Since its the fact that Apple has best of anything, i think it's true
5:28 why wasn't AirPlay working then Dave ?
yeah, apple has taken macbooks away from common users. super expensive configuration. and there is no budget option. many people appreciate macbook screen, speakers, battery life, macos but don't need expensive M1 chip. Not everyone is gamer or video editors.
Occlclclc
love the consumer advice!
Ends up same as everything else FUCKING RUBBISH
Squid Game stole their tracksuit color theme from your hoodies.
Remember, this is still M1 technology.  It's got lots of added bits, but it' still M1.  The M2 tech is already running in the iPhone 13, and will be along presently.
How about that BTS Coldplay collab??
Playing A game lol cause we all know how many games are on a Mac lol
Hahahha, you're old man voice is pretty good!
Wait! He said he's 40?
Is this a good Mac to use for school and work? I need to know if it's good for school and work,.
he looks way younger than 40
What???!!! You are 40? I am 30 and I look 20 years older. hahahaha
Dave saying “I’m old…I’m 40”  Me sitting over here, being 40 😒
In my country South Korea, I’m looking forward to release date…
Thank you for your honest review!
Great review, I like the conclusion. Will stick for my touchbar model a bit longer (I would miss it too much). The stickers are something that would look great on my black Honda though ;)
Really cool tools, I must say. But I don't need them.
They don't have face ID cause they already met the features quota for this year.
Just before these were announced, I was watching restoration videos of the powerbook g4 series, and thought to myself the design still holds up today. Guess I was right, Apple thinks so too.
Can you do a comparison on the M1 max 16 in vs 14 in. Is there a difference in performance? I feel like the 14 in might throttle
you look half your age bro
“They really cool but they tools”
He's 40????😱
Video
Dave, at 7:03, is that a premier error? There's a big green bar at the bottom :( what's goin' on bud
Do you recomment the base Macbook  Pro 16' for casual csgo and watching hdr content mostly?
Just grab the M1 macbook air if you're looking for something to use in simple daily activities on the computer. Thing is great, no fans, good battery life, quick and snappy, and can run plenty of applications/games easily.
Waiting for that refresh model with face ID unlock and maybe new colors. These drab gray and silvers are just so depressing to look at.
Surprise! Apple lies and overhypes. I'll make sure to pay $3.5K for a laptop that is barely equivalent to a 3060, runs a proprietary OS and looks like a hospital bedpan. LOL... Crapple!
I would want to see a comparison between the baseline cheapest M1 pro and something like the 8 core m1 air. Because honestly i'm not sure that at least the cheapest model is that significant of an upgrade like the rest of the 16/32 core GPU m1 pros are
Men i was thinking you are like 24 years old very inteligent young guy. Now i now you are 40 years old very inteligent still young men 👍😁
When you change to Resolve you will be screaming for not changing years ago. Premiere is the worst of all.
Casually mentioning that he's 40 cost him all subscribers who are 35ish and thought they were older than him 😂
5:01, um the Surface Laptop Studio.
40?!
WAIT WAIT WAIT, you are 40??? WUT
it doesnt have hdmi 2.1… i thought this is a pro device?
@4:18 damnn
Dave is the best example for the quote ' Age is just a no.' He thinks he's old, really really really not... 😉😉😉
Dave is the best example for the quote ' Age is just a no.' He thinks he's old, really really really not... 😉😉😉
What typing tester did Dave use at 4:32?
We need an official Dave2D skincare routine.
probably the most level headed review i've seen yet. everyone else is blanket recommending to dump your 2020, or M1 mac for these...lol.
Forced cameras on any product should be banned outright. You should always have the option to hide the camera with something other than a pice of tape. They are taking it one step further now and hiding the camera under the display. It seems they really want access to your face. We all know who THEY are.
I like the ending...The are really cool But they're tools.
I see you with the NF video. Man is straight fire 🔥
2:45              I like Kurzgesagt too
Wait, hold up... WHAT! You're 40?! I thought you're 25 or something
the ram upgrades are so damn expensive that a macbook pro 16 would cost me double and more then my xps 9510. most "pros" dont need that much power in a laptop. for that u got a render workstation or server. its for working on the go nothing more,not for substituting a standard pc and office enviroment.(if ur not free lancing video editor and so one) but for me that is way wrong in reviews. for nearly 5000€ the advantages getting small. its a great device dont get me wrong.   90% auf the buyers will be students who want to say i have a macbookpro
What??? You’re 40??🤯
7:13Finally he told I don't need for online classes
Seems like apple have cut the bullshit and gone back to functionality 👍🏻
whyyyyyy did they make that camera bezel..... damn it
Wait wtf they put the notch in the macbook……??????? WTF.
40!? I Figured early 30s..
Piece of crap stickers, not even worth 10 cents
thicc bois
So you're gonna drop your skin care routine for the 20 year old look or what?
I do love the sleekness of my 2019 mbp 16
I wonder which of these features will make it to next year's consumer MacBook Air. I'm hoping MagSafe, the new keyboard design and that HDMI port.
I'm old, I'm 40!!!? 😂😂😂😂  Noooo maaaan
You're 30 Max!
Your expression just before disclosing your family was watching the BTS concert was the best. Thank you for this review and the rest of your great content.
Kurzgesagt video!!!
Art thou a Vampire, Old One?
I really appreciate your honesty. That's the kind of thing a reviewer and a listener of a rewier need
The old Macbook Pro M1 has better battery life than the newer ones ?
The last few seconds of this review pretty much sums it all up.
I'd kill to see a machine learning benchmark. Something like training a YOLOv3/v4 model on MNIST data
Notch is just plain stupidity. Hopefully other laptop manufacturers will not follow and make this a bad trend. Just look at usb ports, now they are putting them back. Why? Because it was stupid...
xps camera HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Very bizarre and weird. Even if people shout what they want, they don't care and get rid of all the ports, ruin the keyboard structure and megsafe, and put on a weird touch bar. People curse and buy it again. Just like crazy people. Finally, a product with some of what people want comes out with a huge price tag. People are rather grateful for that. It's weird.
5:30 LOL
The fact the he's 40 🤯
"The're just tools, that's what they are" I love it
make a more moderate priced tool with a 16 inch screen.
油管上少有的真诚
Pick the Thick Awesome
The difference between dev2d and other reviewers is, they all feel like fanboys.
Always a fan of the clips used to demonstrate screen quality! Get a good look at Bruce Wayne haha
40 going on 25 lol
I literally thought you were only like 28 years old this whole time...lol
that sliding the sticker fail though🤣
i thought you are just 25 atleast...get some Beard bro 😢🤯🤯
i thought you are just 20
Lol that BTS concert
he is 40 ?  no way
Now that the M1 series is complete… that M2 Air looking pretty nice in the future 😋
I set up a new MBP tonight. One thing I noticed that bugs me about the notch: I played a YouTube video in full screen in Firefox. The top edge of the screen shows the background wallpaper plus the notch without hiding it. Hopefully Firefox/YouTube will fix this eventually.
There’s no way you’re 40 that’s crazy! Still my fav laptop review channel and amazing video as always! Seriously.
“They are cool but they are just tools“
You're a great YouTuber dave🔥💪
Looks really ugly. Like macbook from 2012
Dave: great informational video on newest apple pro product  This entire comment section: “hes 40?!!!”
That intro!!!
Am I the only one that likes the touch bar? Kinda bummed they removed it.
Hahahaha the 40 bit killed me
Kurzgesagt gang
Picked up the 16” one today. Couldn’t be happier. You’re awesome at your job Dave.
"They're really cool, but they're only Tools. " 🥶🥶
I really like your style and content Dave. Been watching for a long time.  I generally don't say but I disagree with your take on the notch.   The notch is a DESIGN decision by apple not a FUNCTIONAL one. This is 2021. Are you suggesting that the large notch is the only practical approach to get a decent quality camera on the top?  What I really dislike about apple is that they are stalwarts in the industry and yet they make these really selfish IRRESPONSIBLE stupid decisions and the industry follows suit. No headphone jacks, no removable battery, and now this notch. Only God help us if we start validating every thing Apple does. It's just a company.
Did the touch pad and keyboard get hot while using?
video request: Dave2D's skincare routine
I would’ve used a pop up web camera
BLOOM WHAT BLOOM, killed me
Common you look 28-34, no way your 40. Not gonna believe it.
I like the whole m1 max and stuff, but the design seems so outdated. I think it wouldve been more appealing if they tapered the edge or try to make it look slimmer.
Punch hole or teardrop notch could have been great

You said you're 40?!?! Please consider reviewing your secret supplements in the next video ;)
Bro, you’re 40?! Asian genes again for the win...
Recommend review
he starts as "everything is good when you go thicc" and ended with "they're tools" LOLL shady dave shay-deeeee
I lost it when he did the 40 year old man voice (4:20)
"Most people who want it, but don't have clear present need for it, don't get it" - said no reviewer ever beside Dave2D. Great review as always.
Right after I heard 'I'm 40' I stopped the video and opened the comments section.
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
OMG there is NO WAY he is 40! He looks 30!
Im typing on one right now and dear god its so good lol
Great advise! These MacBooks are an excellent invention but only required if you have the specific workflow.
2:42 KURZ GE SAGTTTTTT
I would rather have a horrible web cam than a stupid notch. This design is beyond ridiculous. Makes me want to kick the designer in the nuts. 😆
U a real reviewer man loved the vid and advice
@Dave2D Which laptop should I purchase if I am still learning programming doing some trading. Any suggestions.
Nice notch!
927 dislikes? Why? Dave is awesome! Great content always!
Well I guess its time to start saving..
I prefer the look of these but I currently own the 2012 model which is basically the same.
Hope apple make GPUs as well
4:22 He's hilarious. All his videos are shorter with greater quality content
Shit dave is 40, I'm in my 20w and I look older than him
The notch is stupid. That is all. It's also sad that there's not a USB-A port. Yes, it's "legacy" in some regards, but let's be honest -- USB-A wlll always be the most popular I/O port. It's been around for 25 years and isn't going anywhere.
where's that green glitching bottom part of the screen coming from @ 6:57 ?
yes, they are just tools.
How are you 40!!! you look like 30 max!!
Can you recommend it for gaming?
m1 pro n max as for me they shouldnt allow to play games, just no distractions. but ofc money is money, they dont care
these are not professional tools. the only tools would be the ones that buy these that think they are professional.
Dude, for the bloom, old person sound effect…..you are really cool, I mean you are bomb First comment, you are THE GUY
When most youtubers are telling you that these new Macbooks are not for you, it's probably not for you. I've always wanted to get a Macbook since the M1 13" came out a year ago. I have been wanting to replace my i7 5th gen that I purchased eons ago. BUT, the M1 was like the 1st generation of M chips plus it's only 13 inch, and I didn't want to spend on something I wasn't quite sure I was going to like. And when Apple announced the M1 Pro and M1 Max, it really got me excited. But holy moly, these new laptops start at $1,999 lol. I wish apple released a budget friendly 14" version. I guess I will have to wait for another year lol
man I just got the Asus Zephyrus g14 2021 model. when this came out I got a headache, now I am at rest.
impressed by your brillant mind. very fast and clear. thank you : ) nice video
Can't believe Dave is 40. I legit thought he was in his late 20s early 30s. That's crazy.
10% of comments talking about New MacBook pros 90% of comments about Dave revealed his age as 40 but infact he looks like 25 (Sheldon Cooper)
It's a pro model it should had the best HDMI available and that Notch should never be there. Think this guy is in love with Apple no matter when they do wrong.
Loved the advice at the end
Very clear review, thanks
I’m subscribing coz you’ve the best and most honest advice at the end of the video. Keep it up! Stay impartial!
They're tools
So Dave 2D is 40 y.o. and looks like when I was 18 y.o. hahahahaa damn.
Most shocking thing about this video is finding out Dave is 40
the internet shattering information revealed here is you are 40 😂
whats the laptop that he uses that beats these in Adobe?
The design of those really reminds me of the aluminum PowerBook G4s if they were thinner.
Very pragmatic at the end. You’re a good dad to us Dave.
2:40 that looks like Kurzgesagt in a nutshell
It’s became so powerful that I couldn’t convince myself to buy as it is far beyond my daily demand.
Dave, we need a review part 2
This is the expensive powerful laptop most of us don't need.
you're 40? I thought you we're 30 ish. no way that you're 40
Amazing review! Really straight to the point. Do you think these chips will make more sense on the next Air generation for normal users/people just using laptop for standard working tasks? Thanks Dave!
Forty!??
The problem with this laptop is a lot of software that’s not optimized and has yet to be optimized, running like shit in Rosetta.
Hope you're watching this Dell... That camera quality is abismal and led me to return my XPS back to you.
insufficient T&A, but otherwise not a bad video
This is so far the best review of macbooks I have ever encountered on Youtube
I love the ending
Dude you don't even know how much I appreciate your reviews
They are just tools ~ careful.. you will offend Siri. Remember they have all our data
I thick these laptops are good.
As usual, great review! But MANNN....you don't look 40. Honestly, I should've known because based on your delivery and mannerisms, you come off as more mature than other reviewers. Great genes!
"Hey, I'm selling this product.. but you don't need it"
Is anyone else bothered by the notch? I think it ruins an otherwise elegant design... much like on the iPhone IMO.
Dave’s 40? 🤷🏼‍♂️
You're 40?!?!  That might have been the most interesting part of the review. Looking good Dave
The biggest news here was that Dave just said HE'S 40?!?! 😳 You look like you're in your early 30's/late 20's man...  Sheesh
$2000 laptop = HDMI 2.1, please
screw the black apple sticker.
keep forgetting that dave is 40.
The webcam sucks. I get that it's better than the xps 13 webcam, but it's still bad. Why put a notch into the screen if you're not going to put an excellent webcam in there
I was hoping the M1 Pro and M1 Max would blow everything out of the water but compared to the M1, the price/performance isn't worth it.
That ending was so endearing it made me cryyy hahaha. Immediately in love with this channel!
Hi @Dave2D, a good fan of technology and gaming in general here. It would be nice to see a comparison between the new 14" Mac with 16 GPU cores vs XPS 15 9510 with RTX 3050ti, and the 16" with the M1 MAX 32 GPU Cores vs XPS 17 9710 with RTX 3060. To see how this "The benchmark Windows computers" are against these new Macs
So you did not test them for crypto mining?
Gotta love honest reviews like this :)
Apple=🤑🤑🤑
You didn’t tell me anything that I haven’t heard from apple few days ago on keynote .. like what’s the reason of this video ?
Best line of the video: "They're just tools" Amen, don't get lost in the hype. Thanks Dave!
Notch is just too wide for no reason .. just to make it smaller next year
What is the typing software that you used in the in the video?
Love the NF plug during the audio discussion!
40 How??????
ok, how you run Overwatch at macbook?
I just bought maxed out pro for playing minecraft and fortnite on it
Must be nice to look half your age, Dave!
You won a subscriber today sir.  Wonderful review.
You are 40..you look like a 25.
"Everything's good when you go thicc."  --Dave2D, 2021
When the machine is so good, so that people start to blame the notch. lol
WOW I was expecting a whoop whoop APPLE rules review there , well done for keeping it absolutely within the realms of reality
3080 laptops are cheaper and beat m1 max in every way.
LOLOLOL for the old man voice "bloooommmm??? what bloooM???!?"
Dave you are the best!
Why don't they put iPhone notch size front camera into MacBook?
i need a 16" air. i dont need the performance but the screen :/
Great video! Waiting for the best 10 laptops to purchase before the end of this year :D
Face Id is useless on a Macbook Pro
You are AWESOME, Dave. Thank you for that last bit. Time to replace the battery in my 9360 XPS that I bought for $499.
I prefeer retangle screens. Thank you very much.
Really loved when you quoted “ They are just tools “ and damn they are hell expensive for just tools 😂😂😂😂
"Everything is good when you go thicc" - Dave
I refuse to believe that you're 40. I honestly thought you were 33, tops. But great review as always!
40? No way
can it come with Windows 11 installed?
thats chunki
Man! i love your honesty in reviews ❤
Everything is good, when you go thick. Yep, yep.
When you are more hyped about the products bcz of the reviewer instead of the product itself can only happen in Dave2D channel. Great Review dave as always..
Dave needs to put down a link for all his hoodies !
Well i wanted to buy one, but as i see it is notch for me.
function over form is always good, why can't big tech companies learn from this?
What is spec - i could buy- that will last me 10 years like my current 2012 mbp.?
They're cool but just tools, that's all they are! love that.
so in the end is an overprice final cut pro machine and facebook machine.
I have to keep coming back and watch this video to remind myself not to buy it. Window user here thinking, about buying MacBook.
Dave how dare you tell people your age! You are 25 until 2040!
here it is! https://amzn.to/2Zqp77n and you'll get free shipping
40?!? Bro i thought u were under 35
what did I hear? you are 40?? and I thought you are max 30 :))
saying that the M1 Pro is a "nice upgrade" over the regular M1 in the CPU department - and showing a Cinebench benchmark at that moment - is a bit .... puzzling. The benchmark clearly shows THE SAME single core performance and just 10-15% upgrade in the multicore part. Sooo my M1 macbook AIR is almost just as powerful in Cinebench as the "PRO" $2000 macbook 14"?? That's a bit underwhelming for the latter tbh
"But now you're like WASSUP - PORT!" - D2, Dave
I think they added the notch because they don't want to add a notch in the future, when they add Face ID. For a lot of people that would have been a step backwards. So they add the notch now (without a obvious reason), just to "fill" it with Face ID later.
Does turning off pro motion improve the battery life?
How do they perform with virtualization and daisy chaining displays? As a pro user those are two of the areas where apple lags behind with M1
OUCH!!!  Apple's max core gets beat by Intel alder lake and barley beats an rtx3060....lol.  keep paying that apple tax though!!  Nah, I will keep the extra $2k and have a faster laptop (both cpu and gpu) then apple but if you pre-ordered this based on apple's word, well, at least you can look cool....  This reminds me of the "one terraflop per second!" Lie that apple pushed in the 2000's and got sued for it.
I bought a 16 inch 2020 after my 2018 and 2019 have been replaced 3 times by apple because of termal issues. This thing fries and throttles the shit out of the CPU. I can't wait to get rid of it in hope for better cooling. I regret selling my 2015 machine. I hope this one will be a keeper for a few years
Bro looks 25, 40 has me shook
the XPS webcam quality was not much worse than the MBP’s one. The notch is super ugly and the laptop does not look that great. It might be powerful but I expected a better job from Apple.
I never liked Macs, but I do love them now because of how immune they are to viruses, compared to my Nvidia GForce Lenovo that gives me headaches these days 😒
40 is the new 20 🤟🏼🤓
Why is the new Macbook so fat!!!
tarumlüg  Programmierer der Master  K. I.
"These are fun tools, Its cool. These are not cheap. These are really cool but they are tools that's all they are."... Spoken like a true 40 Year old dude :).
You are 40 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dude u look 27 or smth
As a programmer, I am always tempted to buy this because I want speed. And for me speed is everything. But so far the Macbook Air M1 is enough for me. Let's see. Thank for the wonderful review!
any review on thermals of 14 vs 16? I need the m1 max, but not sure which one to get.
what will i do with my fancy Herschel 15" MacBook case? :(
Two words：ugly & powerful
I think you messed up cpu score for 8 core m1 pro everyone else seems to have scores around 9700 for cinebench
wait 40? i thought he was 20's
your 40 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! believe me I am still shocked
What a cool bloke u are... Keep it up man! Always great actual(!) reviews
Finding random videos day 1
It will cause problems when you share some part f your conteñets using Zoom.
Biggest take away from this video is that Dave is 40
I appreciate the honesty at the end mate. Totally right, some great professional tools but "too expensive" for simply daily use. Great video btw.
He’s 40??????? Damn he has aged nicely
Wait your 40 No way you look great
Wth you are forty i thought you were like 25😅
Even if its the best laptop, I just can't stand that notch!
They cannot add Face ID with software?
Why not 14" & 16"?
This doesn’t help premier really?! Which laptop is possibly better?!
great video review!
5700 comments and I haven’t yet seen a Dave4T joke yet.
DAVE IS NOT 40. No way.
You are THE BEST reviewer!
i thought dave was 30 max
so basically I can run divinci, photoshop, light room and even game on this? not all at once of course
They are tools, nevertheless bought it... it’s like a motorcycle... there also tools but I just wanted to have it, worked 2 months for it
I don’t know why. But I love this guy.
my 9900kf has better scores than this one. and its  270usd AHAHHAHAHAH.
Best and Honest reveiw🔥
how is he 40?
THERE IS NO WAY THIS YOUNG HANDSOME LOOKING MAN IS 40 YEARS OLD. PERIOD.
M1 vs g16 pls
Dave you don't look 40 bro
Basically, I really want it, and I really can't afford it.
I so want to upgrade my 2019 16” MBP to a new M1 but I use it to game and boot into windows but new M1 doesn’t come with boot camp and parallel is hit and miss with supported games like fallout, mass effects, dragon age, witcher 3, cyberpunk etc…I’ve been in the Apple ecosystem far to long and way to deep but I may have to take my $$$ and buy a windows machine
I'm curious why the 14" M1 pro/max has so much worse battery efficiency surfing the web. 65% (11h/17h) as much web time than video time compared to the 13" M1 getting 85% (17h/20h)
i won't get it because of this stupidly notch design
1:16 successful controlled his laugh. xD
That's one honnest review, great video :)
no way you are 40
I couldn’t focus on anything in this review after Dave said he was 40. My brain did a soft reset.
Not only is the notch for functionality, but also marketing reasons. Think about it, the Iphone notch is recognisable from a distance when viewing the screen. the same decision must have been made here
Plz Broo Dave do the review for asus rog strix g15 g512lU I7G10 1660 TI 6g
I loved a way you tell it like it is man!
8:15 is why i watch dave2d over all the other tech youtubers
40?....wow
Test SSD Speeds for different storage options
😬 now you got me thinking..🤔
that intro tho... just so cool
40? i thought like 28/30 max!!! damn!!!
Love your advice on the last part of this video.
Face ID will be available on 2022 models.
Apple is like a Ferrari... you don't need it but you want it so bad...
40?? Daheck I figured Dave would be early 30s. And I also agree, amazing device, but not for common folks.
So premier doesn’t render fast
I THOUGHT YOU WERE 17 HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA
6:57 what's that green bar at bottom? rendering glitch?
I like your honesty
It’s weird knowing Dave is 40 when he looks like he’s in his late 20s
I bought the 14” MacBook Pro and then canceled my order because I realized I didn’t need that amount of power. I could get a M1 MacBook Air + an iPad Air for around the same price! Then I realized my 2015 13” MacBook still does all the things I need to do relatively well and it has MagSafe and all the ports the new MacBooks have. Saving money this year, and sticking with my old MacBook. I’ll wait and save up for an update next year (probably for the next MacBook Air). Great review, as always!
@Dave2D, what do you think about this laptop if you just want a good, reliable computer that will last you a long time? I currently have the M1 MacBookPro but the touch bar is driving me a little crazy (I tried to like it)... I just feel it'd be a good laptop to have for many years and I also connect my lap top to another screen almost everyday for work, which is a bit of a hassle with the current set up on my 13". Thoughts?
Petition to have D2D review a product using his old man voice. "BLOOM" "WHAT BLOOM?"
where is the touchbar :/ should be optional like other features like extra ram
Hi Dave, I can see these are quite beefier than the earlier generations of the MAcbook Pros. Do the keyboards have any little extra key travel, like the desktop version of the magic keyboard? I hope so, 2019 16inMacbook Pro and M1 Macbooks had less key travel than the magic keyboards sold separately.
Love the honesty at the end. The products are amazing but the price matches it for sure.  Wish apple sold the old mac book pros - wanna grab 1 for cheap lol
Had to confirm you are 40
My Macbook M1 Pro 16" arrived today. I did a file transfer from a time machine backup - NONE of my files and only a few of my settings came over. It has a version of Monterey installed - but immediately said there was an update available. 6 hours waiting for the transfer and I've not managed to do anything with it yet. Hum...Looks great and the Bong was fantastic.
TIL Dave is 40 years old!
I was not expecting such review
Dave, you are by far the most genuine laptop reviewer out there.
Dave what mac do you recommend for taxing 4k video editing?
oh man bias review can smell it from the first 2 min
I'm really happy with these new machines. I'm really glad they brought back magsafe, HDMI, and SD card slot and ditched the touchbar. I'm half tempted to finally retire my late 2013 macbook pro.
Very genuine review Dave, thanks for this :)
Did I just hear him say these laptops are running Overwatch at 120FPS through Parallels?
I'm sad the touch bar is gone....maybe I'm the only one.
Dave with 40 looking younger than me with 30
Expensive Tools
"Everything's good when they go thicc" - Dave
Thanks Dave, particularly for the closing bit, because I’m the type to make an impulsive buy, and My 16” MBP is less than 6 months old.
You sort of underestimate the importance of tools. Only with tools we learned to shape the world around us as we know it today.
The line”not fun purchase but tools” says all
They are so ugly tho...
finally someone to comare it's GPU power to Geforce. Thanks Dave. /I'm so curious what are they planning for the next Air. 🤩
Man, I have one of these on the way, but that damn thing is ugly. I might just keep my MBA depending on how it performs in my workflows. If it saves me a ton of time, I'll keep it.
dave's 40??????
I hope i look this good when im 40
Your are 40 man, i thought your age is around 28 or 30 something. Damn 👌👽
Please... tell me more about the stickers
He is 40 😯😲
I just turned 50 and I can see the bloom on the iPad. And I can'r see at all without my glasses.
THIS GUY IS 40?! WTF. i thought you were 27 man.
I am getting the Framework laptop when it has touchscreen
i guess we can call him Dave4D
That BTS 5:30am concert shout out. ;__; Thanks for another thorough and thoughtful review!
Ancient
can't believe you're 40 bro wtf lol thought u were like 25 hahaha
Bro you 40? No way
Thanks for the advice , i was really tempted to upgrade from my M1 Air.. but i think im going to wait
Oddly wholesome ending- this is why I watch your stuff man, thx for the vid
Wait, you are 40?
So they bring back magsafe and hdmi, but no usb a? rip
Agree to your advice on the ending part. <3
Having an HDMI port is amazing? No it's not amazing, it was there and they got rid of it. Bringing it back now after wanting a cleaner design just shows the lack of honesty and respect they have for the customers.
Great video, quality content...👌👏
Man I thought Dave was in his 20s all along.
The final note on purchasing decision is so spot on. The whole hype had me hooked for months. Truth is, at this point I am using a PC desktop that is still plenty fast for what I do and I am not editing while traveling for the forseen future. It's A LOT of money to put out for an undoubtedly very cool piece of tech. Keeping my wallet closed for now. Maybe if they appear with a Mac Mini version of this?! :)
It's about Apple got their heads out of their butts when it came to the MBP line, probably gonna throw down for one of these next year after they shake the bugs out.
Hi Dave. What touch-type app were you using to demonstrate the keyboard/finger movement? Thanks in advance 👍🏽
I'm surprised how well the original 13.3 M1 macbook pro has kept up with the thiccc bois
Everything is good when you go thick ;)))
“What’s up, port”. Most underrated line.
Watching as I wait for mine to arrive; good review!  Let's not pretend that Apple wouldn't put a shit webcam in their pro devices however, they sat on that 720p camera for much longer than was acceptable and only updated to 1080p. Much improved but if anything isn't pro about this laptop it's the webcam
Would be really interested to know what typing test that was?
I like the funny Dave
Who else came to the comments at “I’m 40”? 😂 bro show me where the fountain at😂🤲🏾
4:20 r y serious !!? 🤯🤐🧐i thought u would b under 25
Wait your’re what? Forty? Or Fourteen?
Great finishing lines for a good video.  They are cool, but don't buy them for that. Its expensive. They are just tools.
Ill only buy a mac when they add in one more important port. USB 3.0.  Change my mind, no one wants to use a damn dongle.
ummm dave, i thought you were late 20’s or early 30’s at most !! am i missing something ??
40??? You look way much younger! Have you been doing sport/excercise?
you are 40????????????????????????????????????
He listens to NF!
It's funny how Apple pretends like they care about the environment then they give you free plastic stickers so you can show off your pompousness.
He stoled your video https://youtu.be/St8AaEbdBo0
They're really cool but they are tools.. that's all they are!💫 Lit❤️
Dave is 40, damn he looks 30 at max.  Asians only have 2 looks, really old or young haha
For the first time ever I'm not excited for a Macbook! The design sucks!!! Keyboard sucks!!! There is a disgusting notch on the screen!!!! 2020 Macbook designs are much, much better! Definitely a notched and disgusting design! Jony Ive please come back to Apple!
You are 40?! You look like you are in your 20s! The Asian gene is strong with you :)
How can the battery life of the 14-inch M1 Pro device be that low? I just compared it to the results you had in your M1 review, and the M1 Air has reached 11.5h. Is this due to the M1 Pro utilizing less energy efficient cores?
how could you play overwatch on a macbook m1?
You are 40?! I don’t buy it!
Dude I thought you were 25
You are 40? Nice joke 😂
You look 30
Excellent vid Dave!
No way, Dave is 40 🤯!
He's 40 STFU ... No way , he looks like 28-30 ish
4:56 link to those awesome wallpapers?
what is the typing APP in 4:35?
Great video
Apple being serious. Just shows how much the competition have let things slide, and it really shows. I'm a hardcore Windows user and have never considered switching, but these devices are impossible to ignore.   Goes to show how much the drive for thin and light devices has left so much performance on the table.
If you need battery life go for it, if you need performance go for a PC, as clear as water.
It is super UGLY, not as subtle and beautiful as apple macs. It was a great great disappointment when I first touched it after long time of waiting. If you are not a Youtuber or video editor, it does not worth it at all. The best one for college tasks is still the previous 13 inch.
This review is so good I watched it again today 🤍
"They are just tools"
Someone reuploaded your video just with russian commentary. I don't know if that's fair use but here's the link if you want to report copyright infringement https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St8AaEbdBo0
You're 40?!?!?!?!?! WTF!!! I honestly thought you were younger than me (I'm 31) 😇😁
That hand slip to remove the stickers 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude is 40 how?
there's tools
Dave, your closing thoughts, especially the part where you say "you don't need it", is the reason why I like you and your channel so much. You say it as it is. A lot of tech enthusiasts, YouTubers, they hype up the product, but do not actually tell it as it is from a buyer's perspective. Your words are the thing that I needed to hear. Thank you, and keep up the good work!
wait..he's 40?????
This is so true - you’ll only need this if you are a serious professional who knows exactly why you need this. 95% of the prospective consumers would be more than fine with the MBA or the base level M1 MacBook Pro. I have the latter, and am absolutely loving it! Great review as always Dave, keeping it real.
I want the 14 inches mbp…hopefully i can afford it when it is available in the Philippines…🥰 And you dont look 40…🥰🥰🥰
What brand is that toolbox in the back?
YOU'RE 40?? Dude looking AMAZING. I'm 28 and aged like mayo.
Can these still be charged through type c?
I love the honesty in your videos!
40 ??? What in the world is your secret sir ?
oh my god! you are 40 yo. I was thinking you are 20-25 yo man. Simply awesome . "Samajh me nahi aaya par sun ke acchha laga"  .
What! Did he say 40? (4:20) It never ever occurred to me that he was any older than 25, 26 something. I guess my eyesight is getting old.
two major revelations : He's 40, and BTS..
Thanks for being honest at the end
Ugly AF MacBook
You got a like for the old man joke lol
I feel I'm going to be the only one who misses the touch bar 😢 I'm going to need to search for an old intel 16 inch model if I want it on a big model or go with the original M1 mac but only 13 inches
What, 40. All this time, I thought that Dave was 30
Dave is 40? He looks younger than me.
so tomb raider and world or warcraft the only 2 m1 arm based games that will actually use all the new GPU power? amazing chips by still not much following for AAA titles
Yeah, they're tools, but if Apple keep putting its best features (120Hz, mini-led, actual ports, M1 Pro/Max chips, bigger size screen) only in the Pro, and you want to keep using MacOS, it's not like you're having much of a choice
"Everything is good when you go Thicc"  Sure dave 100% Agree
wow, great clip man! what kind of type test app you are using at 04:35 min.?  ;-)   I know, nobody is asking this but I have to practice it.  haha
dude you look 28, and I am from Hong Kong! you, 40? its more shocking than M1 last year
Dave is so right, this is just a tool. This is why I haven't pulled the trigger. My M1 MBP is so capable for my workflow and as amazing and as tempting as these laptops may seem like, they are super expensive.
I am more shocked about your age than the performance of these laptops 😂
Did Dave misspeak?? 40 years? Did he mean 30? Seriously 😳😳😳.. Dude you look like a 20 something....damn!!
everything thicc is good hehe..
Honest reviews as always. This is the only tech channel I even go to anymore, so thank you!
Everything’s good when u go THICC😉
notch sucks😭
You're 40?! Man, you look 30, tops!
FACTS!
DUDE YOU'RE 40??? NO WAYYYYY
Best review I’ve seen of these so far!
40 pog
Mi favorite reviewer by far
You deserve more than one thumb up. 1. quickness 2. quality review 3. realness in the end <3
Thanks for the realness at the end. Sometimes you get tempted to get the best of the best. But what for if you don't necessarily need it.
damn... Dave2d is 40... feel old yet? i been watching this guy since forever great job man keep it up
Yup...thicc is the word. Prefer the M1 MacBooks...
"They're really cool but they are tools" - Very well said Dave!!
They are really cool, but they are just tools! - Dave2D
Im sure that you never see this time lapse video https://youtu.be/EYJl9wTZV68
I really appreciate Dave frankly telling everyone who doesn't have a pressing need for these performance beasts to not bother wasting money on them. The M1 MacBook Pros are still very very impressive, and even beat the M1 Pro and M1 Max in battery efficiency, which is what many other more casual type buyers would really appreciate (students, office workers, coding or content creating enthusiasts). Don't shell out $2500 for something you're only going to be using on half-capacity.
they are really cool but they are tools, Thats all they are. _ Dave2D
Ahhhhh internet, Isn't it amazing how online “experts” are able to complete reasoning in less than 10 minutes about products and technologies that engineers took months and even years to develop? Just a couple of minutes …and boom…
Apple has been putting webcams that bad in their computers for years...
The best line in the whole review : you don’t need it. The truth. Nothing but the truth. Love it!
I know we only see Dave's "best camera look" but I'm 23 and I sometimes look older than he does 🙃
Awesome review
6:12  M1 score is missing. Very wrong.
Amazing review, down to earth with no screaming. Appreciate it!
You're 40??? I thought that you were in your 30s bro
If you told me a few years ago MacBooks will be class-leading performance and efficiency I would've laughed. Really good to see Apple backing up their premium pricing with premium hardware
보다보니까 이쁘네 진짜..
40 ? ayoo he's 40...
Damn the last few mins were best advice I heard about this mac.
40!!!!! wtf no!
You are 40? Woah
I tempted to buy this, the 14 one. but that last part though... yep, it's clearly not for me.  maybe I'll wait for the next MacBook Air (2022).  thanks Dave.
Don’t like the notch. Ok on a phone, unacceptable on a laptop
YOU’RE 40!?!? Get out man! You don’t look a day over 35.
Many thanks Dave - the best and most relevant review of the new MacBooks I've seen.
Best intro
Dave plz review about age 40 , may be its sound crazy but love to hear form you 😆
This was a great video man!
Wait, what? You're 40?😱😱😱
Lol at the sticker hype..
40!? I thought you where late 20s or early 30s....
You are by far my favourite tech youtube reviewer... To the point, articulate, eloquent... absolute legend.. Thanks bro
Damn 40? I thought you was a 24 25 years old guy doing tech.. legit
this thing is ugly
He's 40?!!!!??!??!?!??!
Wait, Overwatch without Bootcamp? Is this VM?
I love the closing remarks about people who only 'want' it.  Nice wake up call for me :D
What was the power consumption while gaming? It would be interesting to see power figures while performing like a 3070
Dave is 40???
Wait.. HE'S 40??!!
40!? You look 27 🤯
4:51 My guy finessed that snake 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Anyone an Architect and using these for BIM? Archicad?
Whaaat? You are 40? 😱 I wouldn’t give more than 30
Wait what you are 40? 😳 You look more into 25 - 30.
Best review so far - as usual :-)
you look 25 lol
Did he talk about thermals?
Typical Apple strategy, Recycle old MacBook (Boxy) design from 2011-2012 as like they did with their iPhone 12 design inspired by iPhone 5 and 5s.
Normalise the old dave 2d
"thickness gives you ports" yeah because that was the reason Apple removed them! Have you seen Fujitsu U series
bruh I thought you were like 25
they should have made mag safe camera that attaches to the back side of top case. Simple.
They're tools, that's it!
Wtf 40
can this game run some games?
Got the 14” can’t wait to unbox and take those stickers and throw the rest away!!
What's new or should I say old. Some old ports are back.....is this moving forward .....where is the touch screen? oops just remembered never had one.
guys I would wait for M2 to come out and maybe that will replace M1 models this year, so maybe you will be able to buy a Macbook air 2022 M2 for 1200, That is what I am hoping
Me Watching this on my 2019 macbook pro 16 that i just bought:  why are we still here just to suffer
you're 40? I tought ur 29
I am 40 to Dave.. but you do the best old man voice ever hehe.
Conspicuous lack of video showing what's inside - I wonder why, Dave usually on that when he reviews a laptop. Mabye just too much of a bitch to open?
I have to say that I was a bit disappointed that you removed the M1 from the graphics review
Bro your old man voice 😂😂😂⚰️
Everything is good when you go thick
I swear you were in your 20s. Late 20s at the oldest
Watch iJustine video. Get very hyped to buy it. Watch Dave2D video. You realise you really don't need it.
But can it play Minesweeper?
Everything good when thick ,girls be like 👀 yes
I wish there was more comparison between M1 Pro/Max MacBook Pro and Intel powered laptop
can it run League of Legends?
- everything is good when you go thick - that's what she said
I DON’T BELIEVE HE’S 40
"These are not fun purchase but only for those who need it" . This is the best line said by any reviewer on YouTube. Thank you for that.
😳
Am i the only one that think they look ugly compared to the previous gen?
😍
the xps beautiful
❤️
🤣 apple don’t talk cheep bruh ur m1 max ain’t near 3080
Weird looking but it's still fine
Also Dave2D 1:16 :   Everything is good when you go thick.
typical fanboy
thick macbooks looks ugly.. feels like 2012.
Yes it a good professional tool but define professionals. If you mean youtubers, photographers, djs then yes i can agree but they are like the 1% of the world's professionals. Can they replace terminals at a bank lets say? Nope.  Can they be used by developers? Yes of course again linux is much cheaper and open source   Can they be used at a corporate environment could be if they are full apple which again are a very small amount of corporations out there that run full apple devices.   Can they be used by network professionals? pen testers? big no as we use linux 99.9%. Can they replace PCs (windows) for desktop applications and office environment? Big no again.   Can these laptops replace my gaming PC with 3080Ti , 240HZ monitor and 32GB ram. Again no. So to me yes great tools, super exciting tech with the integrated armbased processors but who does really needs them?
One of the best videos of Dave. Honesty goes a long way. Way to go!!!
I’m still wondering the performance difference between the 14’ and 16’. Power supplies’ wattages are different.
The fact that Dave listens to NF fills my heart
Lol... looks like a thin brick. Good review and happy someone said it, can't pay that much extra if all you really need is the extra ports. M1 air is where its at
yeah thicc is good. I knew what's you did there
this man 40?
u r 40 wtfffffffffffffffffffffffffff
WAIT! YOUR 40😳😳 Sucks! You look like 30!
I really love the last comments, "They are tools"
the most shocking thing is 40 , im like WHAAAAAATTT !!!! u look 29 or 30ish , you are 40 , damn ! no wonder i have trust issues with people !  LoL joke apart , awesome review as always d2d style loved it !
Dave is 40. *My whole life has been a lie.*
D2D: I'm forthy  Me: HaHa old man... I'm 32... daaaaaamn, yesterday I was 25 xD
"They are really cool. But, they are tools. That's all they are."
fat body + old version of hdmi2.0(no4k120fps) + old version of card reader v2 just 285mbps(no v3 800mbps) + notch without faceid, finally they update 720p to 1080, but it's too late - no need (in last 10 years I never use camera in notebook) + old bluetooth v5.0 (no5.2) + wifi 6.0 (no 6.0E for future) + touchbar gone(they push it last 5years, then chang mind:)) + I still always with usbA dongle for normal use... thanks apple...
1:15 everything is good if u go thicc  dave is a man of culture indeed
What's your diet dude what are you eating on a daily basis?!. That should be your next review video. You're 30 not 40 so maybe your diet is messing with your brain 👌
Does anyone know if the 14" has the same power in same configuration compared to the 16"? I ordered a 14" maxed out and I'm a little afraid of having less power.
One of the best review!
Great review Dave 🙌🏻  That 3080 Laptop, does it have 100w power usage under full load (with processer power needs), or is that just the display card?
Wth are you really 40?
The Teal Build in the back though
Dave, hate to break it to you but 40, isn't old. :)
Thanks for that last advice. I was very tempted.
@Dave2D I totally agree with your conclusion. I went full in on the M1 with a MBP-13" and three months later with the M1-MacMini and the ONLY thing I'm missing is the support for more external monitors. All the rest is fast enough on those machines and I'm using FCPX for editing and even Lightroom/Photoshop run fast enough. The only way, I could get myself into a new 14" is when I sell both of the other machines and upgrade then to a 14"-Max - but hey, that would be still a €2,000 payment in addition to the sold "old" hardware...... Nope, I'm sticking to the M1s.
Today: touchbar has been reverted to buttons (yay!) Nek minute: iphone reverted to having home button.
You're 40?!
Ismael medes villa
YOU. ARE. 40????
Test it with Resolve and noise reduction.
Man you nailed it ! "TOO EXPENSIVE FOR A FUN PURCHASE" that was a mistake I did when i purchased the iPad bro, when I barely needed an iPad Air !
“Everything is good when you go thicc” Yeah it does 😏
glad to know that my 3080 mobile is  still superior
This man capped. He can't be over 30, looks about 25 tbh
40 year old  Wow you look younger like less than 30
Full of bullshit talkings!!!
"I use Premiere, i dont wanna spend 5k$ on a new laptop, because my windows pc is still faster." This statement proves you're a true for the people tech reviewer 😂
Is it posible to have that benefits when editing e.g on samsung T7 EHDD? (Or you have to edit on the Startup drive or only on external thunderbolt?)
1:20 I am so dirty minded 😭
Everything is nice when it's thiccc - DAVE2D
DAVE: iam 40 ME: WTF you are 30
Wait what! MacBook on a chart with rtx?
Good video,  I have an innocn OLED external monitor for my old MBA,  will this 14" MBP support to plug that also?
What if it was based on ARMv9?
40?
I have to stop watching things I can't afford
I always hated how people panicked whenever i had to reach for my dongle as well
I'd choose the awful quality web cam in a heartbeat, it's perfectly fine for online meeting.
oh hell no for some lay man like me i NEED that pro motion display with those insane speakers plus the 16 inch. I cannot settle for less since my pc monitor is 175hz.
Oh shit. his old man voice was so realistic lol
Dave I have been your subscriber since you were at 800k and now you're in 3.44 M. I subscribe becuz you bring content that is fair or truth. if you keep on speaking the truth you will be in 10M in no time. lots of love
What I hate about the state of apple is if you want to dual screen with an M1 laptop it's the 14" and 16" only which starts at $2k to dual screen. So stupid.
What? you're 40??? But you barely look 25
1:16 ah yess
My dude, you 40?
How do you run Overwatch on Mac? Especially ARM processor mac? 🤔🤔
Thank you for the so well detailed review. Which one do you recommend for Video editors? the 14 or 16 inch?
The most important thing I’ve learned: Dave is 40
D2D: "There's no way that Apple is going to put a webcam of that kind of resolution into their Pro devices!" Apple, using 720p cameras in all of their pro laptops until last month: "uhmmm"
yes... its just a tools...
So True !
Music producers who work on Mac are probably gonna have a field day with this one, especially with that 64GB RAM option. What a time to be alive.
Am i the only one who notice that this man is handsome? Hehehe.
1:16 Thats what she said... about thermals... and longer battery life...
Everybody was waiting for this
Everyone: I just got the new maxed out shiny MacBook Pro M1 Max. Dave2D: Shut up they are tools!!!!!
he looks way younger than 40
Thiccc and 40.  All anyone got out of this video that we’ve been waiting months to see. Lol people get sidetracked so easily….
love the conclusion
I was hoping higher cpu performance difference between m1 and m1 pro kinda disappointed
"They're really cool, but they're tools. That's all they are." A very sensible take.
How is no one in the comments asking who Dave stans in BTS? 🤔
Heyyy I did get those stickers with last year’s MacBook Pro 😩😩😩
Everything's good when you go thicc ~ Dave2D, 2021.
Is it really first automatic adaptive screen for switching on battery runs? If I recall it, all the Asus ROG units, especially Zephyrus ones, use this approach as well, by default, automatically, and have done so for over a year already ;) And I think other manufacturers had similar solutions as well...
You are 40? You can't be 40. If you are 40, than I'm at least 50. And let me tell you, I am 25 right now. You look significantly younger than me. Please don't be 40.
Look at the prices lol RAM From 32GB -> 64GB + $400 😂 DISK From 1TB -> 2TB + $400 😂 DISK From 1TB -> 8TB + $2200 🤣
I came to Dave because I know he always remind me of the right purchase decision, which is not to spend money on something you can't properly use. You are the best, Dave.
these are tools
Dave in 21  I am 40 ... Everything is good when you go thick 😁
"Everything's good when you go thicc"
Dave is 40😲😲
ARE YOU 40?!? You look like you're 25 lol
Is what you're saying in the conclusion there's not enough wow to justify the (more) expensive price? Apple laptops have always been tools, so real question what's wrong with these ones? EDIT: Because its been like that forever.. every intel mac has been equally so expensive compared to the same hardware elsewhere... that's never been an issue with macs. So what is your gut really telling you? I want to know now.
What do you think if I get it for the use of software such as SketchUp, Adobe Illustrator, and CAD?
🤣🤣
14 on trending my boiii
Makes sense why they called it relative performance in apples chart, because if they used Geekbench, the actual result would only be <50% of a 3080. While we're at it, you know what else scored 13000 points in cinebench vs the m1 max? a non-overclocked 9th generation 9900k. :/  Yes apple made a 15w chip, but it's really not that impressive in the big picture of the products available and price.
That last part was the best when Dave said that these are tools for professionals and not for fun-purchase. That’s accountability. Many product reviewers, who foolishly call themselves content “creators”, do not show such accountability. But Dave is certainly not among those people. Kudos for the excellent review and sincere opinion!
Who cares about stickers
Really love how you presented these laptops. There is such a hype around it. Yes it is very significant progress in term of battery, fan noise, energy efficiency and also performance, but nothing crazy like 2x, 3x or 4x of Intel's. And when it comes to the performance, do you really need such a power ? I think most of people don't. And you nailed it at the end "They're tools. That's all they are." .... I have my Intel i7 from 2019 and I will happily use it for next few years from now. It is just a tool, and if it serves it's purpose I don't see a reason to spent 3-4k euro for new one. You reviews are the best, keep it up bro! And thanks.
Fantastic video! I'm music composer and Producer orquestal mockups, what opción is the best por me? I has thought m1 pro, with 32 GB of RAM. Thanks.
all these years i thought you were in your early 20s.
5:20 you can HEAR the shame in his voice
as expected, half a 3080 gaming performance lol
I will buy these because of battery life, screen size and ports.
I appreciate how you honestly mentioned who it is for, regarding its price. Other people out there are just pushing people to impulse buy these. Thanks for the review. Quality and concise as always 👌
Is it review or preview? Rubbish content…
Looks to me like Nvidia and AMD will live to see another day, at least on the high-end of the GPU market. I'm sure Apple will continue to improve their chips, but it'll be a while before they surpass a 3090 or 6900 XT, which is what seems like a lot of the Apple acolytes were hoping for.  I wonder what the Mac Pro will look like with Apple Silicon... Unless they decide to stick with Intel Xeon chips for a while longer on those machines.
Except for the notch, everything is perfect. Kudos to Apple
OPEN IT UP!!, We want to see inside.
Look at that subtle off- white colorings. The tasteful thickness of it
Subscribed for statements like the last one used in this video. Genuine and no hype.   As a product designer myself, I DON'T need this. It's just a TOOL and you would need this ONLY if your workflow requires this kind of high-end performance.  For everyone else, the M1 MacBook Air is still the best laptop purchase.
I really admire your VFM approach to things! And your honest reviews and verdicts.
Man, you do not look 40 at all 😂. You look at least 10 years younger
To late it’s a fun purchase, although I plan to keep this for 10 plus years, only ever had a garbaged $800 Aussie dollar laptop so will be good to have something that can just even run zoom well for the next few years. Plus resale is good so not like up it’s ends up being that big a purchase anyways. Thanks for the insights though appreciate it.
40!!? I hope i look as young as you do at 40!   Also what would be better for a first time buyer the 14in or the MacBook air from this year? $999 vs $1999? If money was not the issue
If this guy is 40, I'm probably 60 years old something
Next gen we will See Play on Mac competitive M2 and M2PRO and MAX they will be the Next best combo GPU and CPU for gamining
Ok I was fully focused on all the great info until you said you were 40! Like, what!?! I thought you were late 20s these last few years 😂😂
performance wasn't shocking I expected more after the apple presentation
Wow, that M1 Pro has about the same FCPX performance as the 16" i7 Macbook Pro! I think I will walk mine back into the Apple Store for a refund when it arrives in a few hours. :(
That is for the scores.  I was just walking around Akihabara looking at the prices for a good 3D modeling & rendering machine.  Then I heard about the new Apple chips.  So I’ve been waiting.  But yeah, seeing those scores for that price…. I’m sticking with getting a fat Windows workstation, at a lower cost.
There is no way he's 40, genuinely thought he was 25-30.
Loved hearing your take Dave.  I agree with others in the comment section that your last point really brings most of us back down to earth.  They are cool, they look cool, but I don’t need one.  I don’t have a workflow that requires this much power.
i was hoping you would show the interals :( still, great video!
1:17 😏
So my mac mini m1 still catch’s up , phew
they look like prototypes.
Your intro is too long for your channel 😡 Jk no hate
I appreciate the BLUF! Thank you for a concise to the point review with a dash of reality at the end! Great review…
DAMN!! (kevin hart style) when dave mentioned his age. I honestly thought he was in his in mid 30s ABSOLUTE RESPECT. also as always awesome video
This video was all I needed to see. Does it render that much faster in Premiere? No? Then the only reason you buy it is novelty, or gaming.
Noticed u like' NF'
Everything is good when you go thick Dave2D 2021 A.D.
40? HOW, you barely have at the most 24 years old haha
Dave is 40???????
0:30  To pay $ 3000 for  "Apple BLACK STICKERS" your kidding me !!!
Premier Pro isn’t fully optimized yet for M1 like DaVinci Resolve
yeah MBP blah blah...we expect the realest info from Dave2D...but wait...you're 40? fml.
Hahaha Bloom part was funny!! Excellent review Dave!! <3
I love that we have found the limits of thin and are moving back towards a functional thickness that respects thermal management / port selection as being important for the consumer.
That design...yikes.  Would have prefered flat edges or just the same design as last year.
WAIT DAVE IS 40??? He looks like he's in his mid to late 20s.
I don't understand why this laptop comes with charging adapter but the iphone did not? what's the agenda here? and people really don't like a numpad huh?
I like thick Mac and I cannot lie 🎵
I teach game development at a local university and I could see the M1 Pro or Max as a definite benefit to my workflow in Maya, Blender, Houdini and Unreal. My only hesitation is that I do not believe that it is compatible with Oculus Quest 2 (wired connection for larger projects). Do you have any additional info to the contrary?
Apple product strategy: Sell a bunch of products with features people do not like only to release the products that the people DO like a few years later to make them shine in comparison
wait... Dave is 40?!
Damn, those M1 Max Macs coming real close to my 9900K Multi-core scores
Every tech reviewer should say what dave said in the end 'you dont need this'
Bruh, just found out you are 40, you look at most 26, you look might as well be 17
Forget the MacBooks, I think the real product is whatever routine Dave is using. Dude looks at least 10 years younger than 40. What is the secret?
That old man voice made me nearly spill my tea on my 2016 MacBook Pro lol😂 Guess I should get a new MacBook Pro! Another awesome video!
Daaaamn! You look like you're at your late 20s sheeeesh! Thank you for the awesome video, Dave!
Daaaamn! You look like you're at your late 20s sheeeesh! Thank you for the awesome video, Dave!
I actually listened to the phrase twice when he said "i am 40"
Dude, I though u 20 something.  When I heard 40 I was like what!  And went back to watch again just to make sure I didn’t hear it wrong. 😂
One of my favorite videos till today. Congrats!
1:17 "everything's good when you go thick!" You heard it here first. Haha! Get'em thick! Haha!
Always love your review ! No bs staright to the business
Love when you upload!! Be safe everyone ❤️💛
"Everything's good when you go thicc." - Dave2D 2021
Okay, Dell's webcam is awful, but what about Huawei? They hide it in keyboard area and it works great! Without notch 🙃
Great review Sir ❤...just love your practical approach to reviews even though as a tech youtuber, these new MacBooks are clearly cool.
ive said it before but I remain unchanged, this is THE BEST review site on Youtube. Dave you get the balance just right between informative and discerning. thanks from the UK mate.
Do the fans blow on the screen?
Great review
You are 40?
Papa Dave
I can make these stickers at home
Dave coming back at us, dropping truth bombs. It's true, these are shiny and great, but if our system does the job, and even the M1 would do it faaar better, we shouldn't be tempted. Great review, as always!
Am I the only one wondering why MKB doesn’t have a hands on video yet, Apple ghosted him or something? 😅
He is 40!!!!!????????
The truth said !
Yeah, you just fact checked my thoughts…if you are 40 i will look like a 25 y/o when i reach your age hahahaha, hail for us the babyfaced's
I'm not buying one until I'm perfectly certain that I'll be traveling again in a few month. I'm thinking of ordering M1 Max 64GB 8TB, but the price they charge for 8TB still not sure if it'd be worth it.
good thing i wateche the whole video was about to purchase one until he said that if I don't have a clear cut use for it don't get it and that hit me hard because I want to edit videos and code butt I can do that with my computer but having a laptop would give me a benefit but not needed rn.
I’m surprised you’re 40. 🤯
Everyone waited for the 14.. wonder how many were ready for the price tag
Bro. Luv the advice in the end
I hope to see that more and more game companies start to optimise their games for Apple ARM Chips or even more Apps Developers optimising their apps. That way we don’t need to bother too much about ridiculous GPU price anymore. 😏
Been wanting to go back to the MacBook Pro from my XPS 13. I wish they had also added the normal M1 to the new 14 inch. Yes all I do is browse and edit go pro footage from the weekend. I will probably still end up with the M1 pro top tier just have to decided on which screen size.
Hi Dave. What is the best gaming laptop so far?
You’re the best of the bests✌🏻 keep up the great work
They have to save Face ID for a future model. It’s a money thing. Can’t give you everything you want at once.
*Dave, you should’ve included the test of these apps on battery as Apple showed in their presentation that the fps dips significantly while Only on the battery on windows laptops and these new 💻 do not.*
I think most people will be fine with normal M1 Macbook Air. these are just too expensive and too powerful for the majority of people
I prefer MACBOOK AIR M1 , thinner , fast enough for 95% of users and plenty of battery . very few people NEED professional mac book.
Damm, you are 40 but actually looks like 25, that's it make a video on skin care 👍
I can still go with a crappy webcam rather than a notch laptop 😒, but love to see Apple making the laptop that really matters.
"Everything is good when you go thick" - Dave2d  Can't argue that.
They are cool but they are tools 👍
Very good and honest review. They are just tools 🧰
Wtf, ain’t no way this dude is 40
3:29 amazing
Great review. Very on the side of 'Enough', instead of purely focusing on specs and why it can/can't do x. Hopefully PC can catch up or we run Geforce ARM Books at some point.
can the base 14" play fortnite smoothly?  none stutter
Dave2D is my favorite tech youtuber
"thicc is best" yeah, thicc is BEST
Dave2D the only reliable review source that don't go wild with intros and b-roll footage.  Straight to the goddamn point, love it.
04:22
Loves ur simplicity 🌝🍻
Would have been nice to have more workflows considered in the review apart from videos. Felt like this was more of a preview than review
Now they need to fix MacOS and make it like a modern day Snow Leopard.
WHAT!?! YOU’RE 40? Bro u look like ur in ur early 30s
shoot man, i thought u r just 30
"They are really cool but they are tools. That's all they are."
This is a review. Please stick to the technical details and don’t give us your stupid opinion about purchasing or not
everything good when you go thick....yeah I know🌝
I would have preferred a USB-A port over HDMI. I'm sure most people would use USB-A a lot more even in 2021... HDMI you're probably inside a house trying to connect to a TV etc, so a dongle is fine.  When you're out and about you'll probably want USB-A
u got me laughin 🤣
"Everything's good when you go thicc" Dave2D 2021
They are tools!
I definitely don't need all of the performance it offers, but there are too many things in this model that I can't get elsewhere. And with that said, the order has been placed.
#15 on Trending 🎉🥂
Really love the honesty. I think for basically everyone else m1 is good enough. I haven't had any issues with it and was able to do everything I need. Hopefully in a couple years m1 pro will go down to the base models.
It cracks me up how fast Apple excuse makers forgive nonsense like a notch on a computer. I’m sure it’s a great computer but get serious. Also why do people keep talking about FaceID like it’s good. They need to get rid of it.
T. H. I. C. C. B. O. Y.   Otherwise, imppresive performance tho'
Hit us with the hard truth at the end thank you
it look dull in this view! OMG
i wonder why literally no one has the space grey 16 inch yet that's the one I'm looking forward to see!
Best real world review! Thanks for making this quick too 👌🏼
I was looking at Daves hair thinking when he's older he's going to be grey for sure. When he mentioned his age I thought oh I see why his hair is the way it is.
Wait! Dave's 40!?!?
World on fire anyways
I knew it, These are great machines but not as powerful as rtx 3080 laptops.
Hey that's a  " kurzegat" dinosaur
Dave: "They're tools. That's all they are." Me: "I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave."  Seriously, that was a very blunt, refreshing message to the masses. Mister Rogers is nodding in approval.
100w 3080 has pretty significantly worse performance than a 120w 3070. Don't be deceived by seeing "3080", this isnt even close to what a gaming laptop can do, even if you can buy almost 3 of those gaming laptops for the price of one of these macs. So if you like gaming or do stuff that uses a lot of gpu horsepower, these macs aren't for you.
wait this guy is 40 ?!!
Imagine defending Apple for cheaping out on the HDMI port on a $5k laptop
I'm old i'm 40... You mske me old to, unfollow😂😂😂
Hold up...all I got from this video is you are 40??? What?
1:13 wow y'all already chipped it already haha
This'll hit a million in a few hours
Black Apple Sticker = You know Apple means business because your bank account has already felt it, probably you even sold your kidney so you can afford it!!😂
I think I’ll get this for future proof laptop
1:16 EVERYTHING IS GOOD WHEN U GO THICK , Lady's WHAT ARE U EXPECTING 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man i need someone to told that i doesn't need stuff which i don't have any use. 🙌
Dave is 40 and he buys Optimus Prime robot. Beat that.
Everything is good when you go THICC - Dave (2021)
Yea for the cost, thanks for pointing out that it doesn't have face ID, for that much money, I'll wait till next refresh where they add it to consider it seriously.  Face ID is too much of a nice user feature to skip on a pro level laptop of that caliber.  But definitely liking what they are putting together, just needs a little more to make it a buy.
We all know dave is 23 years old.
can u charge with the magsafe and tpye c at the same time for faster charging?
1:15 everything is good when you go thick
"Everything's good when you go thick" TWSS
7:40 why do the new models with larger batteries have lower battery life running the exact same test then the previous gen M1??🤔 Like I do know they have more high performance chips that use more power but dosen't web and video usage require the same power no matter on what machine you run considering these aren't power/graphic intensive tasks?
Everything good when u go thicc, awwwwww yizzzzzzzzz

Dude look 35 at most, anyways love your content 👍🏻
I am 23, I thought how can someone be that good at my age. I am at relief now!
What is your config? 14 inch
Thanks for the review. And the last note about they're just tools, yeah that's a good advice.
Apple lost its soul in design. Make product thicker? Notch on the laptop? Given in what the laymen wanted ?!
POGU HE HAS THEM ALREADY
It's kinda sad that we're at a point where reviewers are scared to say something negative about the product, because they might lose their Early access privileges if they say something bad..
We need a grandpa voice only review pleaseee
40s ????? I thought u were in ur 30 at most , damn Asian genes
best part of the video  DAVE IS 40     HOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYY SHHHHHHHHHIIIIIITTTTTTTTTT
Dude is 40 🤯
So ngl, I love the setup of the 13" M1. Touch Bar and all, just works for me, all I really want out of it is the M1 Pro/Max performance in the same package. Like it would be amazing to have the 14core gpu and 32gb of memory in a 13" package.
“Everything is good when you go thicc” 😻
*"Everything's good when you go thicc."* Amen.
I would just get the Air since I don't need all the expensive power from the Pros, but I really want the better speakers and the ports. I wish they made a middle option!
“Everything is good when you go thick” 👀
U r 40?!?!?!?! WOW🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Had to pause after he said 40 and come to the comments section. Love your reviews mate ❤
1 min on sticker? Stfu
"everything's good when it's thicccccc" ,. Noiceee😂
whaaaat? Dave is 40?
I think the critique of the HDMI not being 2.1 is fair. It’s not like these laptops are cheap anyways
I didn't know you were 40! I always guessed early 30's
So dammmm honest love you brother , i have purchased m1 MacBook air a week ago and I am satisfied with that ^_^
I really appreciate that what you said there at the end man. You just laid it out there in a few lines, "if you are the average user and don't have any clear need for these...these are not for you. They are too expensive!" Thanks so much for keeping it real. You're a LEGEND!!!!
how is this laptop different from a laptop on windows?  what programs will not work on it?  I know how difficult it is to transfer files from iphone to windows, can I download a movie from a torrent to a mackbook and then, for example, transfer it to a hard drive?  What other points should I consider when buying this laptop?? Thanks
No HDMI 2.1? Apple suck my fat one. Distasteful for a 3K laptop with the title of PRO.
“Everything thicccc is better” Quote of the year!
40 and a gaming king. Look at those headshots, look at that typing speed, look at that kill in snake.
Your endings is right. But once you add 16 GB to the 13 inch it’s only 500 bucks for the screen and the design, MagSafe and extra performance even though it’s the most cut down pro chip so for me the base 14in is justifiable. I would love all the coverage on that one especially.
Rally loved the end of the video, saved me from even mentioning it to my wife.
Dave how TF are you 40!!! I thought you were in your mid to late 20s
Dave is ARMY? I like him even more!
1:16  "Everything is good when you go thick"  Dave2D, 2021
He's 40???????? I thought he was some college student. Wow!!!!!!!!!!
"They are really cool but they are tools. That's all they are."
Thanks for your amazing review video! Your comments about "blooming" are awesome, Dave!😆😆
fish in the aquarium lagged from 8:03 to 8:06 and swim smoothly after that. Did anyone else noticed ?

"Everything is good when you go thick". Gold. This is why I'm a subscriber :D
Got the macbook pro 16" two years ago and am really regretting it now... Though my old 2011 macbook died so I had to upgrade, so sad it took this long to get the ports back
Key takeaway in this vid: Dave is 40?!
yea, now I need to listen to NF.
https://youtube.com/shorts/AdldbzFugKA?feature=share
Kept a young look for 40
I don’t like the notch and I hate that they removed the touch bar. This would of been an instant buy otherwise. I love the touch bar and use it all the time. I also prefer the look of the M1 13inch MacBook Pro over this.   It’s a laptop it shouldn’t have a notch smh. I’ll be keeping my 13 inch M1 MacBook Pro for at least the next 5 years
Hey Dave, I'm a college student and I've been using my 13" Retina MBP for 8 years now. Would you recommend against getting the new MBP and going for the Air instead?
Love the notch😍
40?!?
He's right. It's really expensive for just a purchase.
So, you are saying the M1 is OK for most people?
“There’s no way Apple would put a camera like this in their Pro device” 😅
Just tools honest review!
i had no idea u were 40...I'm 22 and u look younger than me
Ok but which Mac mains use Premiere as their de-facto video editing tool of choice?  You have superior and affordable options that don't require monthly subscriptions (Resolve, Final Cut) right in front of you, but you choose pain.  For what?
Great advice… thank you so much. My next upgrade will probably be just to M1 for now.
I thought they said this was the 3080 killer... What happened? lol
“Everything’s good when you go thicc”
Dave being 40, is more heartbreaking then the new mbp prices.
Dave, very informative as as always. I have only used Windows Laptop and my current laptop is Dell E5430 3rd Gen Core i5.  I'm a Digital Marketer, but I'm looking to learn some adobe tools as well. Buying This 16" machine will be beneficial for me or not?   BTW is there any current or upcoming Windows device that really provide value for the money?
1:17  “Everything’s good when you go thick…ummm”
Socrates: "Know thyself" Dave: "They're just tools"
I wonder how could you play Overwatch? Is it possible?
It looks thick. Am i right? XD
You're 40?! are you serious? you don't look any older than 25! =)
Would the 14in be good for architecture work like 3D modeling and renders?
"Everything's good when you go thicc" - Dave2D 2021 😂🙏🏼
This is cool. very honest opinion.
Dave last year: "Apple gaming, laughs" Dave this year: Overwatch 120fps Me this year: Please Valve, do your best.
Everything's good when you go thick .  Valuable life lessons .
I love your videos
Waiting for mine to arrive. Thanks for the detailed review!
Uhm, dat kill streak doe!!
Idk if I agree with the hdmi comment, 2.1 would have definitely been better. And, if they really wanted to put things for us to use in a “pinch” they’d give us a single USB-A slot, for this reason alone I’d still need to keep a dongle around, smh. Still love the damn thing tho, arrived tomorrow (Tuesday oct 26th).
I LOVE UR MINECRAFT INTRO
Amazing section there at the end
What do you do with apple stickers?
How is this compared to the razer amd 14-inch one ??? Which one is better.
HAHAHA love how u mentioned the bts concert 💜💜💜 The quality must have been insane!
thank you for this video! i will continue loving my dell xps 9710 2021 and ignore this machine until its old lol.
the fact that you watched the bts concert with your family hahaha dave you’re the best
BTS concert??? Gaaaaaaaaaay
Everything is good when you go thickkkkkkk 🤣
Could they really not think of a way of doing an "Apple aesthetic" protrusion for the camera? Fantastic computers otherwise.
dude, what? You're 40? whoa!
The fact is, Cryptocurrency is making financial waves and fighting against poverty in this modern era, and the question traders as them self is if this the right time to invest? Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating which means the Market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish . While others Still continue to trade without the fear of making loss , others are been patient. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me, I started with 3.5 BTC and I have accumulated over 11.7BTC within 3 weeks trading with Expert Daniel Wright His method are top notch and profitable , obviously he's the best . You can Tele gram ( @Danielwrightfx ).
Thanks for saying they are tools.

Nope,  nuh uh stop right there, u're not 40, u r lying and lying is bad. U are 30
They are really cool but they are tools 😭That did it for me.
This review looked more like an Advertisement. Or may be, the affection of someone suffering from Stockholm Syndrome
he litrellyis the first person to review this laptop
"They are really COOL,  but they are TOOL"  yah...i am sticking with my 2013 MacBook Pro
So as someone who's looking to buy it as a Music Production machine on non-Apple software (FL Studio), how do the gains translate in real world performance, over the M1. I say this, since the price gap is pretty significant and have always been a Windows guy all my life. Great review as always Dave, you're still 31 in my head :P
I agree. Everything is better when you go thicc
He's 40?
Dave, you are the best reviewer 👍👍 🍎
Your review blows away justice's.
Dave2D the only reliable review source that don't go wild with intros and b-roll footage.  Straight to the goddamn point, love it.
The only really relevant spec in this video: Dave is 40!?!
WTF you ARE 40!!!!???? holy shiet, i thought yo were late 20s early 30s
Dave is 40?! what are you, a vampire?!
didnt want a macbook since my 15" 2015 one, finally an upgrade! it ran overwatch at 30fps on bootcamp, now this one runs it at 120fps over virtual machine.... that kinds of blows my mind
He is already 40? Damn, he looks way younger. That stuck more to me than the actual review. Lol 😂

How the hell do you already have it?
Who you calling tools?
This is the future of devices, just like the original iPod. Thin devices doing everything someone would need (gaming, enterprise, mid level VR, etc.). And thin Desktops doing the same plus high end stuff like advanced VR, high quality HDR movies, etc.

Holding to my M1 Air till these go on ebay in 3 years :B
No, these look hideous and boring monster , give us performance benchmark. you are just agreeing with apple notch is fine but apple could fit same resolution camera like XPS did. I liked your last comment and agree most of the people does not need them.
I know I am in a microscopic minority but I care more about what I see than what others see. Let others see my nostrils so I don't have to see a notch.
Old man voice Dave won this video by far.
Having a 2.1 port doesn't take away from the purpose you noted. It only adds functionality to the pro users you said the computer is for. Also to help justify the premium price. Hdmi 2.0 was new in early 2010s.
Not a fan of apple, but the m1 chip is so dam impressive. Hope other company’s start to follow apple massive lead on arm chips
FaceID is reserved for next refresh.
u 40??
You’re 40??? Holy crap man, I thought you were a 26 year old dude! 🤣
Love your honesty at the end! Keep it up
Every computer is a tool, if Apple wanted to be serious they would get back together with NVIDIA  nothing beats Nvidia sorry. 32 cores what a joke, expensive internet and word processor. 17” Razer > M1-Max64
Everything's good when you go thick                                  - Dave 2d (2021)
Great video
Dave is a 40 year old who's in love with his Optimus Prime robot 😌 After watching that video I thought you were at most 30!
Dóname una porfa soy de Honduras
I don't necessarily need the absolute performance gains from this new model, but the performance reduction from thermal throttling and fan noise on my 2019 16" MacBook Pro is just ridiculous.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD WHEN YOU GO THICCCCCCC
Dave2D the only reliable review source that don't go wild with intros and b-roll footage.  Straight to the goddamn point, love it.
you guys think the headphone jack will come back to iphones?
best conclusion yet !
Wait... This guy is 40?? No way
Wow the closing statement is so realistic and piercing. To see behind marketing and take them as tools, they can’t make you more happy or less sadder. So glad I am subscribed to this channel
damn I never thought Dave was that old! I was thinking 35 AT BEST!
LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH THIS MAC BOOK 2021 JOY WILL FADE AWAY BUT THE JOY THAT COMES FROM JESUS LAST FOREVER AMEN
There are lot variants ...which varient did u use
i simply do not believe you are 40. maybe 30
The first 486 portable was about 3in thick, vs. about 1.6in for the 386 of the time
Good video Dave
Love the nr200 sitting in the back lol. I'm more excited for alder lake and an SFFPC than for these macbooks, as cool as they are.
Dave2D is 40 but looks 20 sheesh
For someone who yet needed as powerful tool, would this make a good investment? say even the lowest specs 14 inch model?
Wait Dave is 40!?
Everyting is good when you go THICKKKK. -- Dave 2D
whats the website that Dave uses to test out the keyboard?
MacBook Air M1 is all I need for all day coding, Xcode & Final Cut sometime.
Great insightful review!  I hope you enjoyed the PTD On Stage concert! It was awesome. I watched it on my M1 Purple iMac, 4K was impressive. I had the multi-view on my iPad though.  Too bad Tae injured himself, he looked so sad. But I'm glad it wasn't serious and he can still walk. Speedy recovery for him!
What what.....dave is 40 wtf.... Dammm... I wanna know the secreto my friendo
“Everything’s good when you go thick” I can’t agree more 😂
R3D Raw files are probably the poorest supported file format for this chip. If you're using H.265, prores or BMD Raw in Davinci Resolve, M1 Max would crush an RTX 3080 laptop.
What do you mean you're not 20?
What's the reason you can't play overwatch on the Mac normally when you can play wow?
dude youre not 40.
Just curious. Is that Tomb Raider running on Parallels, or natively?
Gaming test of Overwatch on Parallels at 3:20 :)
I've gotta say, the old body shape was way better. Not really sure why that had to change to fit the new hardware.
I see you! Watchin that NF music vid! I see yah… that’s my boy
Even this "good" webcam is awful, I don't understand how a $2000-$6000 full PC can't just have the same front-facing camera as any run-of-the-mill phone or iPad. Such a complete joke.
i picked up the 14" to replace my mid-2014 MBP. felt like it was time for an upgrade. Wouldve gone with an air if it had a refresh like the pro but pro is what we got lol
Wait, Dave2D is 40!? Gtfo.
Pretty terrible review with little to no benchmarks.
The old M1 have a better battery life ??
I'm not sure about this, PERFORMANCE....yes, way too good. However, design wise...it's looks like an my aunt old laptop.
“I love the thiccness” best line ever! 😂
Every things good when you go Thicc 😎  ~ Dave 2D
It seems Apple certainly doesn't want common people, at least in India, to buy any of the MacBook Pros 2021. The pricing is insane. The 14 inch starts from $2598.39. WTF!
wait you are 40? you look younger than me an i'm in m 20s
4:20 I am 40 !!!! 😲

Damn, Dave is 40?!?!?! That Asian genes looking like 30.
Dave's old man voice is very good!!! 🤘
Dave is 40 😱. Would've gone early 30s.
Surface Pro 8 and Surface Laptop Studio also have adaptive refresh, cake with an update.
Dave40Dad, either he is just really bad at making up a background story for a virtual youtube character, or we are all MUGGLE.

"People complaining it doesn't have HDMI 2.1, it is not what it is used for", that's how you spot a fanboy. :) Else If you are charging a pretty penny, better offer me the best. period.
Been using my MBP Retina 15" since 2012 and im finally going to upgrade to the 16" M1 MAX and hope that one does as well as the old one and lasts 10 years.
Would’ve loved at least center stage 🙌
Dave is 16 at best.
Dayyum 40 years old!?
if you manually drop the refresh rate on laptops to 60hz, on gaming laptops, how is that a fair comparison? because most users wont switch the panel to 60hz every time theyre on battery? so... isnt that really misleading then?
Everything is good if u go thicc!! -Dave Lee 2021
Great video!!

I wish I was still going to school so I could justify buying one.
HES 40???????? Man don’t look a day over 25
COOL! you are a BTS fan. also just became my favorite reviewer. :)
4:20 we need a dedicated video of Old Dave reviewing stuff
Everything is good when you go thicc!
Hey Dave, curious to know if there is a "Low Power Mode" on both of these machines? And if so, whats the impact on the battery life?
What is your opinion on bootcamping the Mac and using it with windows? Is it more worth to just get a similarly priced windows device?
Bwoah, the closing statement is on point!
I heard 'I'm 40' , got the shock of my life and I can no longer focus on the rest of the video ...
They’re really cool but they are tools- Dave 2D 2021
Been waiting for this review! Great stuff Dave 👍
I still have my 2008 17" Apple Pro and use it, still works. This new one looks as thick as mine and it's gone back to some of the stuff that made the 17" so great!
Could you please do a comparison of these to dell xps 15? Thank you!
40 is not old bro, join the club 😁
Anyone else find it strange that Apple caved to port demands on the Macbook Pro, but didn't cave to USB C on the iPhones? Sounds like the Macbook director should have a chat with the iPhone director. Lol
I’d need to sub again ‘cause I loved it
Dave2d: “Everything is good when you go thick” Me: 👁👄👁
It’s incredible how everyone finds a justification just when it comes to Apple. The HDMI port not being 2.1 would have been the worst thing on Earth should it have happened on the newest XPS, ThinkPad etc… not only that, but c’mon, the port selection, especially for a pro laptop, is still lackluster. Where is the real USB port, the Type-A? You know what’s even more convenient than plugging in HDMI? Being able to plug in a thumb drive which 99% of people do. And boy, these laptops are huge. Idk, not as impressing as M1 on the Air last year was. I hope Dell comes to their senses and releases an XPS 17 with ports next generation, that could really give this a run for the money it executed well. Not to mention that would also run a much more open environment, which for some really matters compared to this communist walled garden Apple is presenting in the name of performance.
What a tool 🔥
Wow you listen to NF 🖤
“They’re just tool” nicely said.
UHS-ii?
ugh! makes me want to sell my comfort-spot intel mbp 2020 these are good good!
cool
But you can manually change the refreh rate!!! just saying!!
What’s a Pro video 8th on trending in Australia?
WTF dave is 40?! I thought he's in his early 30s
What I took from this review: Dave is definitely not 40, well at least not his physical vessel.
Ahhh yesss the BTS concert 😌❤️
Very nice video Dave, thankyou so much :)
Yeah I don’t need that… too late I already bought it 😅
40?! I know that’s not actually all that old, but you look so much younger. Edit: On another note, I really appreciate the more down to earth approach to reviewing these, and that unless you have a clear need/use-case for these tools that you shouldn’t buy them. Sounds obvious, but sometimes you get caught up in all the hype and just want it to have it, so you really helped me decide I don’t actually need one. I do video edit and use many Adobe products, but seeing as how the MacBooks aren’t specifically better in that regard than a top end windows machine kinda pushed me off the fence. I do seriously enjoy the Apple aesthetic, but not for that price.
They're only tools..   But Dave.. how would I get those BLACK APPLE STICKERS!?   (I wouldn't surprise if there are markets for those original stickers.. just like those BTS photocards, aren't they? Fans status symbol 😅)
How are you running Overwatch? Bootcamp doesn't work, so virtual machine?
IT IS THICC!!!
Your dead on, it is too expensive.  It’s frustrating how apple always finds a way to screw people out of their hard earn money.  The 13 is still available with the old format with its video cable issues.  They make it so complicated.  New 14 inch with M1 would have been great.  But no….
Honest man as always
#SilverSqueeze📈
Everything good when you go thick 🤣
Thank you Dave, you just saved me $4,000. As much impulse as I have of getting one, I don't really need it because I don't use any Apple tools (besides Xcode, but I'm not working on big project at the moment).
Is it really playing Tomb Raider on 2k high settings with 83Fps average? Without even being optimized for Metal API? Apple never actually claimed to beat 3080 but if optimized it can get really close to 3080 in gaming
Man, Im on a losing streak in predicting what word youre gonna say in the intro.
These stuffs are TOP NOTCH
So wait, does this mean you can’t take a 16” MBP on a plane? I have always been told it has to be under 100 watt-hours?
6:58 is it just my screen or there is some green glitches(?) on the bottom?
Ugly garbage as other Apple products...
Apple is killing it
Can i play bf 2042 on that?
I only watch this on your channel: you telling people it’s too expensive and don’t buy them if you are not a pro user 🙂 Your reviews are awesome! Respect
So what other laptop that are like mbp but cheap?
One second. MacBook aside. Dev2D you are 40 yrs old 😳... Whatttttt.....
Will there be a difference in performance for M1 max in 14 inch and 16 inch?
“My family was watching a BTS concert” sure dave, sure…
40!!! I thought you were in like your late 20's
i like that, in the end "they are JUST tools", use what you like, and yes USD5K is way too much,
Rush the review to be first huh? That seemed like a first look rather than a review
40?!!  Dude, you look 25. TOPS.
My clear and present need is docker 😂
checked me back into reality at the end, thanks dad, i mean dave
No Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro reaction? Yours is the first one I searched for. It's a pretty big release to ignore, no? Edit: Never mind. Lol
It’s my first time watching your video, man，ur video is great
damn, I don't need to upgrade my 2019 16"....kinda want to tho
i just bought my m1 2020 mbp at the beginning of the year 😔
Never seen the MacBook look so industrial. Doesn’t look like the artsy, simple apple looking laptop, which I guess speaks to what you said about form factor and elegance. Good for the pros I guess. Can’t wait to see the MacBook Air next year
Yeah likely better to wait for the 2022 macbook pros. By then they will likely reach 3080 gpu power while maintaining efficiency. If you spend 4 to 5k should be a 3080 gpu equivalent.
youre 40, im 3
Why is everyone only getting the silver version of the MacBook 16in?
Im 17 and look more older than Dave 😓
“Everything’s good when you go thick” 😎😎😎 myyyyy man
I love that closing statement, reminding you to keep sane that it's just a tool, and whatever gets things done for you, that's the one you get. That's why I love this channel.
YouTubers age slower than regular people.  At my 40 I look like 45, Dave looks like 35 or less.  Amen
40! Honestly you look young, good on you👏
Good ending
My man is getting old 😭
What website/app is that on the type test??
https://youtube.com/shorts/mY57d6E-4w0?feature=share
🤦🏾‍♂️ they didn’t add the hdmi port to be used in a pinch during business meetings. It is very much a fail that it’s not 2.1. Same with not using the latest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards
I don't need it but I bought one anyway.  Why you ask?  Because I currently have a 2018 15" MBP with all it's associated keyboard and heat problems.  Got a god trade in on this POS too.
I know it's not a popular view, but I'm really going to miss the Touchbar.
wow, i dont feel the need to watch another review after this
Wait, Dave is 40 👁👄👁
Apple just decided intel CPUs are too hot to handle and designed their own CPUs
I appreciate Dave wrapping it up at the end with a genuine take on 'do you really need this at this cost?" The fact is for over 80 to 90% of users/consumers these machines are way more than you need. M1 is super fine. Save money.
The "you don't need this" at the end is so true!  I have a 16" Intel MBP that's nearly fully speced, and I had no intentions/still have no intentions on upgrading this generation.  I use my MBP for  music production, and photography.  I do sometimes feel the need to upgrade, especially if I'm making a large photoshop project, or exporting 100 Tiff files or making a crazy experimental song, but that just doesn't happen enough, and it doesn't impede my life enough to make it worth the upgrade.  It does get annoying, but it probably happens a handful of times a month, and might save an hour or two throughout the year.  The $4-5k I'm saving by not buying a new MBP is definitely worth the wasted time.
lol Apple has always put 💩 y cameras into their “pro” machines. This year is an outlier and it’s still just 1080p
I love the last lines - "They are tools are at last".
You're 40?! I thought you was 25! 🤯🤯🤯
Please test Blender !
What's crazy to consider is that, 15 years ago, when the MacBook Pro was first introduced, it had a very similar design to that of this brand-new model. Then, in 2009, the unibody MacBook Pro was released, and everything changed. Finally, all these years later, we're seeing the return of this beautiful design language. It might not look quite as modern as it did back in 2006 (heck, the 2006 MacBook Pro still looks like a current laptop); however, I prefer this over the tapered look that MacBook Pros have been sporting now since the late 2000s.
Apple seriously missed the opportunity to add a few more pixels and make the 16 inch a 4k display…
Woah woah, quite unfair to compare this to a 100W TDP RTX 3080, that gpu goes up to 165W with Db2 and would smoke the M1 max
😁🧔🏾‍♂️😐😳 Wait 40? Dude 😃 I thought you were 30? 👍🏾👍🏾 Anyway, I just don’t like that notch. I wish Apple would just INNOVATE. JUST STOP w/THE NOTCH! For Christ sakes! 😩😩😫😟 Please!, Stop giving us crap that we don’t want!
Ah yes, Apple making crazy claims about this M1 and M1 Max is false yet again. But really, I think they should just stick with what they do best. Their own ecosystem and sound quality are unmatched yet they still try to compete with other systems. If they put the numbers out there of how fast the M1 processors/GPUs are compared to previous years for users who use the Apple systems and apps, they would do a lot better. Seeing such a massive improvement should be something that every company strives for.
The gpu on the mac is useless for most people as there are no games on the mac
The most impressive part about this video was learning that Dave is 40, dude I could have sworn you were 10 years younger!
Now I can tell my wife that we need to get a new apple macbook to watch BTS concert!
no link to buy hoodie...
That desk tho
“Bloom? What Bloom?” Hilarious 😂
They're way more square in shape than the event made it look. I guess they do fit the aesthetic of their other products.
to be fair, the gaming was done on games non native to the M1, so of course it would be lower than games running natively on x86 vs those that need to be emulated
What are the stickers for?
You cannot be 40 😱 I thought late 20s at best (or worst lol)
Everything is good when you go THICC
THE OLD MAN VOICE WAS SO AMAZING!!!
01:16 That's what she said.
i'm loving the 14in chonkbook
"Everything's good when you go thicc" - Dave2D
How did you get Overwatch working on ARM? Just using Windows 10 on ARM and Microsoft’s x86 emulation…?
Looks great!  I'm probably going to go with the base "14 it'll be more than enough performance for me, I hope to have it last for years, and I want those ports.
🌈 Windows 11 👍
Wondering what's the app used to test typing speed @4: 40
dam i wanted to buy this so bad but since you said it's too pricey I wont buy it. maybe wait for it to go on sale
UGLLLLLLLLLY MAAC !
He said it has a great camera because its a pro model..... but when it comes to the HDMI, i guess having the old spec is pro, not to mention the card reader has the old spec as well. The lazy excuses for having a old hdmi spec on a expensive pro model is stilly.
I rather have poor quality camera and no notch all day long
"They are really cool but... they are tolls" Wisodm!!!!
Wow Dave’s 40?? He’s out-20ing most 16 year olds…
Just tools. That's what people tend to forget these days.
8:11 This is why i always love your channel, your honest, and always practical. Unlike other channels out there that just push viewers to buy things they don’t even need.
Who tf gives a shit about those apple stickers 🤦‍♂️
Hold up.... 40 my ass. Ain't no way. 29 at MOST.  That aside, these are insane.
green sweatshirt is working
I bought the 2019 16" because of the escape key.....but I would have held out longer if I had known I could have ALL the buttons back!  (But I mostly use the magic keyboard right now, so I almost forgot my computer has a touch bar...)
What's the typing app at 4:32?
YOure 40?????
Add face ID and HDMI 2.1 and I'm actually tempted. Alternatively no face ID and make it a hole punch.
Everythings good when  you  go thiccc
I'm not lying you definitely don't look 40 you actually look 20 years younger at least 25 to 26.
it's so amazing... to know that dave is actually 40.
Best Review I have seen so far!
hdmi for the bts concert is prime usage
I SO wish you had done work flow tests against the original M1? I'm trying to decide if it's worth getting the pro chips at all over a simple MacBook air for basic video rendering in final cut.
You look like 30 not 40
Waiting for M1 pro Mac air
YOU'RE 40???? Damn how do you look 10 years younger?
Dave is 40? That surprised me lmafo, thought this guy was in his thirties the hell lol
Love your note at the end. I'm a full-stack web developer so I'm looking at these especially for their insane performance, and the fact I want to go from desktop to laptop to have a less "wired" environment.
I've never owned an Apple product or need this MacBook at all, but Dave makes me feel like I should buy one.
Damn dave is pushing 40, sheeesh
Ooo these are boxy, didnt think it was boxy when they were announced !!
Love most of this new MacBook Pro...but can't believe they didn't go with HDMI 2.1 so you could get fast refresh (120hz) on external monitors.  What'd they save...5 cents..?
Damn totally wiped all the doubts. They are not that good afterall. Really good review!
thicc is love, everything needs to be thicc
Dave’s 40??
fantastic review
Agree 100% hdmi is not for High end use but convenience.
Answer is 30" for the video title Dave.
Everything is good when you go thick
Dude, you’re 40?!
Interesting, a Radeon 555X and 2.2Ghz i7 gets just over 16fps on Aztec Ruins High.  "It's just a tool, it's just a tool.." "Gaming.. on Apple?!"
"Everything is good when u go thick" that's have to be the honest quote I've heard in while
Dave2D is 40? WTF?
What’s is the speed of SD card reader?
Man he's so right... I don't need this, but like I'm going to college into computer enginnering. So i might need it in a few months. I did want to buy the 13 inch macbook pro, but man i need my function keys not a dumb touchbar lmfao
What's BTS concert?
If the notch goes away in full screen apps, whats the point of having that extra 1/4 inch of screen up there? since its going to be off anyways, lol
"You don't need it. Too expensive to pick up as a fun purchase." Thanks for putting it into perspective for me! Looks like I'll be trading in my 2018 MBP 15" for an M1 Macbook Air instead.
Just saved me $4000, thanks man!
bruh.. you're 40? da fuq...
I don't like seeing only 120Hz but it's Apple... They have probably so silent fans because they have vapor chamber instead of normal cooling solutions, which is usually also found on highend laptops.
They're really fun,  But they're tools. Yup
And … are those full sized keyboard?!? There is sooo much unused space.
But can I play cities skylines on it?
The best anti hype review I’ve seen. Thanks Dave
Want this, but no clear and present need, you dont need it. Thanks Dave, for such sage advice.
Pinpoint essentials covered in the review! Thanks Dave!
They simply could make the bezel a bit larger and be finished - no Notch left. why not?????
Interesting. Peter McKinnon seemed to have a different experience rendering with Premier.
You can get similar performance with a mac mini if you really don't have money
you was precise: this time Apple did a product that its function over form
OMG! Thank you! I just needed to hear the last bit! I am still curious of Da Vinci Resolve comparison in real world usage with a Windows machine. From every other video it felt like it would wipe the floor with my full build 3080 - Ryzen 3700x PC.
Yeah, no miracle happened apparently. They aren't on the 3080 level, and not even on 3060 with 90W+ which can be purchased for a fraction of the cost. Battery life is actually impressive, but honeslty I don't remember seeing professional video editors working in the middle of the desert with no power socket around. Apple come up with way too expensive devices for what they actually are. Good, but expensive. I think this is the unofficial Apple moto though.
I wanna kick off my xBox and TV, is 16GB  enough for games like Warzone?
Sorry Dave, you are a wise chap, but that NOTCH is an absolutely inexcusable (and potentially deal-breaker level) nonsense Apple did this time. It is an insult to us consumers, it shows Apple lost every bit of respect towards its clientele, they really think all Apple customers are stupid? There cannot be any rational, valid reasons for such an ugly and useless notch as that one. Period.
Everything is good when you go thick "(Dave2D 2021)
Very very solid review, as always! Real life battery are a bit disappointing compared to advertised, but still incredible. Very good & important reminder at the end. With Silicon, the MacBook Air is truly enough for most people.
hi, can anyone tell me what typing software he used at 4:39 time line, thanks in advance
What a stupid video
Personally I careless about the webcam quality.  How often do you actually turn on the camera in zoom meetings?
They're really cool But they're tools - Dave 2021  Yes still hold on to my 2015 MBP Because they still working fine for graphic design tool Still use it daily, if they say Apple making things obsolete. Well not the MBP 2015
Grandpa Dave's reviews 😂👴👴
40???? Ok now I'm convinced that asians don't age!
Nice Aquascape Dave2D!
Axe the notch and give me usb a Bezels aren't evil
did he just say he's... FORTT??? My man really only looks 30
4:27  Dave looks younger than I thought
I'm Down with the Thickness.
Yes! Finally someone who is matured supports my views to these machines. Like is said in comments to other videos: Money you can earn, you can save, you can borrow, but what really matters is how much difference is it going to make compared to your current setup? If this is all about bragging rights, i can brag about money all day without buying these. What really matters is how i treat the people that matters the most. Treat them in a positive way regardless of their wealth and help those who need helping. You will find happiness by doing good than simply buying the latest tech.
Great evaluation of the new machines. I only started subscribing to apple youtubers when I picked up my first Mac (M1 air) last year. I had avoided macs for the past 30 years prior to that but the M1 was that much of a revolution. I found that a good percentage of those channels were gushing fanboi types praising everything without any genuine evaluation. Even calling flaws features (cough Rene Ritchie cough). So I have been clearing out all my subs to the fanboi's and you have just saved my subscription to you with this genuine video. Keep up the good work !
Face Id may come in the next version. For apple to get custom screens or other hardware manufactured it costs a lot of money, so they order a larger amount of the same product and of course they get it cheaper. So ordering a million screens without a notch to put on this macbook pro and then when they have face id for the macbook ready they'd have to order another million of redesigned screens withe the notch and that would cost more money. So they've ordered a few million screens with notches and put them in all the new devices. I hope someone reads this comment.orElseThrow()
the last comment that says you don't really need it.. it's an honest touch to let people know
Could we get an elaboration on the Loop - 250 nits testing setting? The battery life is actually is almost troubling-ly shorter than advertised or is your test setting slightly different?
Jesus this guy is 40? I wouldn't bat an eye if he said he was 25
So it only took ten years for Apple to go back to their best laptop chassis
"Everything is good once you go thicc" - Dave2D 2021
I really do not understand the dislikes. Review is on the point.
Dave 2d is 40 years old? wow he looks more like 27 or 30
overwatchh 120 hz, on what settings? common man
You’re 40!?!?
So now to justify the price of Apple products they're being described as "tools".  Now that's funny.
But but but… “You don’t need it”. But.. “You don’t need it”. Ok….  ;(
2:41 i’d know that design style from anywhere 👀
0:48 He speaks the true true.
thing's a tank
Sounds like the Razer 15 Advance is my balanced. Portable optimized school/working/gaming laptop.
5:19 "My family was watching a BTS concert..." Dave looks so ashamed of himself omg
Hold up wait you are 40?!?!?! WOW
It’s the BTS for me!!! 💜
You’re 40??!!!! Wtf
Currently have the Old M1 macbook dont think i need an upgrade as final cut still runs smoothly
The subtle pause after the "everything is good when you go thick"...
“Everything is good when you go thick” I feel you brother.  Wait, are we talking about the same thing?
didn't know reviews dropped, this the first and I'm content
Dave2D the only reliable review source that don't go wild with intros and b-roll footage.  Straight to the goddamn point, love it.
damn i really want an hdmi but i'm too broke for that
6:16 in term of graphic performance, does it mean 3060 have similar performace as 14" m1 Pro?
Thanks Dave, your final words are so wise. I really wanted one but the reality is I don’t need one
I'm too broke to buy such a laptop, yet I watch all your video's cause they are just so damn satisfying lol.  Keep up the good work!
What’s that touch typing app?
Thiccer than a bowl of oatmeal hahaha
What are your recommendations for alternatives? (For photographers)
DAVE IS 40???
can't believe Dave's 40
anyone else saw that premiero pro green stuff, that happens to me too
One if the only none super hype early looks everyone else look like paid apple schills.
OK that's a fair conclusion
Nobody plays games on Mac. Nobody!
Not sure what's more impressive: - a game running at 120fps on a MacBook - a MacBook displaying all 120 of those frames
I want someone to talk crap about it so I can convince myself not to buy it despite not even needing a maxed out m1.
“I’m 40”. Dave2D is the Paul Rudd of the tech world. Geez
5000$ CA 💔
The price is the reason I just picked up a M1 Macbook Air. Does what I need for now with good battery life.
That was a brilliant old man voice
Can you compare the battery life to the LG gram 16 and 17 inch.?
Apple knows we need 64GB ram but not the 32core GPU, and so decides to bundle those together on the MAX so we buy that instead of the "PRO". Good job Apple
How are you 40????? You look younger than me and I'm 20 lol. Please share your skincare routine 😭
WE watch Dave for his real takes love the way he closed out the video
I genuinely thought you were in your early 30's
You’re forty!?? Wat
Wait ur 40 o.o
I almost lost it when he said he was 40. I knew he had kids so I assumed he was 35 at the oldest, but he could pass for a 28 year old. You've done well Dave. Keep moisturizing or whatever black magic you do bro.
Really cool tools ❤️😊
Verdict: THICC
Notch. Okay. But WTF is it so big?!
You're already 40??? Dang, I thought you're just within your late 30s...
Man really great stuff to put things into perspective on these two performance beasts.  Jeez you look like 18 yrs old !  So I need one windows program to work on. Is parallels the best way to emulate windows on a mac? Thanks S
They are tools….that’s all they are. Succinct commentary about our society’s obsession with these tools.
For that price u could build a 3080 ti gaming pc, sure not as portable as laptop but still.. For that price? Too steep for a laptop.
Personally, the most impressive thing about these products is the not the products, but that Apple went backwards on form, design, and, functionality that was better for the consumer. I didn't think I would see the day when they would do that this aggressively. Good for you, Apple.
40? You look great dude!
He’s 40… FORTY.
Forget the  about the new MacBook, ....... 40 YEAR OLD? , please share you eating habits with us......amazing.
I really like touchbar. I hope apple still update 13” one as business ultrabook
The real question is, silver or space gray 😅
40 what? I thought he was around 27-ish :D
I think the real question we all have is..... how fast does it burn your lap?

"Everything is good when you go THICC"  - Dave, 2021
Apple is getting good ngl but each time l watch an Apple product review, the reviewer gives Apple the benefit of doubt, explains Apple’s questionable decisions. On Windows/ Android, the same is not applied. Anyways l have an iPhone so don’t @ me, just an observation.
"I'd love that, maybe I could use this" that's me, and I never used any Macbook before
Its hilarious how youtubers are trying to promote the notch as a good thing.
You are 40? the fuck man, I though you are in your late twenty.
My 2019 MacBook Pro was 3000 at the Apple store and the new 14 inch is 1000 cheaper than my old MacBook Pro.
The most shocking thing I got from this video is when Dave said he was 40…. DAFUQ?!??!?  I seriously thought he was in his late 20s at the oldest….
Are you 40? Damn, looks like 30'ish
THE BATMAN
HE IS 40!?
Great conclusions, loved the video
Fuck the macs, who the hell is 40?!!!!!
HMMM   lets see  no way to upgrade memory or hard drive  cannot upgrade video card  cannot run windows cannot play any any big time games. mostly lousy  mobile  games why would  anyone buy this garbage????  OH I KNOW I WANNA BE TRENDY I WANNA BE KOOL..  there are way better laptops out there  and i hate laptops
Well the most shocking part of the video was finding out he’s 40!! I thought Dave was late 20’s early 30’s 😂
Man I’m so pumped to finally see your macbook pro review. But then i fanboyed when i saw batman HAHA awesome devices and an awesome film 🖤
Bro theres no way you are 40 i wouldve said 30 maxxx
I am not a Pro, just want to do email and browse the Webb  but since I want a regular size laptop and not a sub-notebook my only choices are to buy these or a windows laptop.
1:17
Thanks Dave, you just saved me a lot of money, for a second I was tempted.
notchbook
What PC Dave using atm? Razer Blade 14? Or what?
You are 40?!?! Holy shit you age well
Loved the personal comment regarding possible purchase. Very good.
40? I guess nerds never leave this late 20s early 30s look
I do need it.  Just dreaming how fast I can search the internet and load youtube videos!!!
Both too expensive in my opinion, considering that I found the Macbook Air M1at 850 euros on Amazon a few weeks ago, which is still the best deal in my case. In fact I think it is still the best deal for most users. 8 or 16 GB unified RAM are sufficient for most case scenarios, not to mention the "regular" M1 CPU. Also, the notch for me is a deal breaker, completely unnecessary. The only actual and meaningful upgrades I see are the HDMI port and the charger port, which they should have never taken off in the first place.
There really cool but , there tools thats all they are .    BEST YOUTUBER COMMENT EVER
The testy newsprint arthroscopically consist because tongue etiologically squeak along a poised antelope. drunk, guiltless zone
Great video!
WHAT !! YOU’RE 40!!!
Few years ago you guys are also those who love the thin MacBook .
great ending, perfectly summarized the MacBooks
I think they planned to put Face ID but couldn't and scrapped the idea at the last minute
Incredible review, does it run cs go?
Wtf? U r 40??? I swear I thought u were 26-27! 🤯
Dave is 40??????????????????????
4:10 I am 40 O.o
Watching batman trailer , listening NF he is a man of culture .
The last sentence made my day. I really was tempted to buy the new MacBook Pro (14 inch, 120 hz, macsafe, amazing speakers, mini LED, ports really tempting ) even though I know I would never need such a powerful notebook and the price for a student is really too high. (I know this device is for professional users so the price is probably justified ) Well will wait for the next release of the Macbook air while still using my MacBook Air 2015 and iPhone 6s :)
Thanks for the advice dave, I was tempted to deposit a kidney for this
Love seeing NF at 5:05
Kurzgesagt: 2:41
Looking great at 40 years old!!
Great laptop review as always! That CPU/GPU is really impressive! :)
can i play on cs go without lags?
Wait, wait, wait. You're 40?????? My guy looks like he's barely 25. Instead of making a review on your laptop, tell us the secret of how to look young my guy.
You’re FORTY? What the fuck. I thought you were like 34 or something . . .
You’re 40? I thought you were like 28
ports exists 13 years ago: normal standard, and 2021: new feature! LOL, also notch and hdmi 2.0 is a deal breaker for me (yes I can afford one for my professional work)
The table is back???
No built in camera if I could choose, I would rather have an external one!
That worm game tho-- 4:49 you got the thicc one there
Yes, they are just tools. So don't buy if you don't need them and if you don't have money. Don't be like those people who buy iPhone 13 on impulse with loaned money. My friend is like that, and she's drowning in debt and spending addiction.
would love to see playing tinywatch on this machine lol
Those Hanzo shots are clean Dave 👌🏼
I'm sorry but I fucking hate the notch
and yet, samsung, oneplus, huawei, all figured out a tiny hole punch for the front camera. but not apple, (mayabe 2022, they will reinvent the hole punch on their 13 macbook pro, and call it the max-pro front facing cam )
Dave might just be one of those very rare people that when he says he is 40 years old, it just feels like he flexing on us lol
I love how you reminded everyone to be financially responsible at the end. That's hella important & I appreciate that.
These are gonna crush xcode and even Android studio compared to my 2019 Intel MBP, can't wait!
Wait! Wait wait wait! WAIT!  You're 40?!!??
You're what?! 40?! You need to start a fitness and skin care channel!!
The notch is absolutely retarded
I have the M1 MacBook Air and its amazing, best laptop I’ve used. But god I want better brightness and an extra inch on the screen but this price does not justify that
Wait what!! You’re 40?
imagine he is talking about a woman, - THICK - Gorgeous !
Where i can find those wallpapers?
You're 40? Dude share some of that fountain of youth
40 man you look like 25 for real
looking nice but really expensive again
this whole review is.. 'this isn't the best, but it comes close.. and its double the price! so thats good.'
You're 40??? Homeboy you look 27 xD
Really like that they're making their laptops chunkier. I vastly prefer build quality and cooling over aesthetics or lightness, especially in a laptop I plan to use as a workstation.
Shock! I thought you are 25! 30 max!
Went with one. Never owned a Mac, been PC all my life. Starting editing, definitely could’ve lived with an M1, but to future proof spent the extra £800… Not sure I’ll think it was the best decision, but too late now
this time looks like apple g4 laptop back to 2006
I miss touchbar
Nice video, thank you :)
The $500 more expensive 16inch has: - slightly higher resolution - larger display for better multitasking without external display - longer battery life (few hours) - better notch-display-body ratio  - slightly larger trackpad - faster base model 10core CPU 16 core GPU vs 8/14 - more powerful charger  I think its really worth it to go with the 16inch. A larger display with longer battery life can help you submerge in work far away from home.
“There’s no way that apple would put a camera of that resolution in their pro device”  All the prior MacBook pros with the 720p crap camera: 🤨
Wait. *HE'S FOURTY???*
This just in Dave is 40 not 20 lol
Thanks a lot
Dave this video was super helpful to a personal level. One of your last lines: "...for most people that want this, but dont have a clear and present need for it, YOU DONT NEED IT" I am a tech junky and use my laptops for basic work, but i love the tech in these machines. I wasnt sure if i could justify spending over 2000 on a new machine. you video (and end comments) really sealed the deal for me. Dave, you saved me 2000 dollars and you earned a loyal sub. Thank you!
I'm sure these Macbooks are great with video editing, but can you test it for something like 3D modeling with CAD software. And compare it to Nvidea Quadro series graphic cards.
We just gonna jump over the fact that he’s 40 😱
"I've been imprisoned by Apple, again" - should have been the title
Next year macbooks will start at $4000. I wonder how people afford these.
Waitttttt you are 40 ??? Ok you shocked me more than the Macbook with its notch buddy.. Well done !
mmm is Dave Fillipino mixed? could explain the youthful appearance
Pretty disappointed to see the Pr performance compared to the 5600M. Definitely not worth the price for me based just on that. Wondering how it would compare on a Pro Res work flow though.
Anyone else selling all their belongings on eBay for money to get one of these
Is nobody gonna admit the fact that this man literally said what we are too afraid to say? “Everything is good when its thicc” 🥵🥵
40???????????? WHAT??? HOW?????
I'm good with my Pro M1 from last gen. The lack of ports is annoying sometimes. But not annoying enough to make me upgrade haha
Can you please share the typing app???
Interesting! Thank you for sharing it.
Great vid Dave
I AM 40..... WhatTheFaaaa...  I Think he is vampire...
Laptops sound awesome. Pretty sure Dave is lying about 40
I thought this guy is like 22/23 or something… HE‘S 40?!
The notch on this MacBook doesn't even look bad.
Dave primarily did this from a gaming perspective, which is not what this machine is made for. The GPU in these are outperforming $6000 GPUs 300w. It’s crazy!
"everything's good when you go thick" 😂
What a bullshit of a statement is that?!...Nobody loves thicc like a brick laptops you apple fanboys will accept any shitty design apple throws at you
Everyone loves thicc
Great review!
I love the last statement, really how the hell am I going to buy one at such a high price if there is no investment from it to be had
Love the video as always. Just wondering though, you mentioned that Adobe Premiere didn't crush the competition. Has Adobe fully optimized its application suite for the M1 Pro / Max?
love your stuff Dave but your testing here was kinda flawed. you're comparing the scores of a native x86 machine running a native x86 application (Tomb Raider) against a ARM64 machine running through Rosetta 2 for translation to x86(?) can't see how this makes sense. would've been all fine if you would have brought it up in the video but you did not.  edit: same could be said for Adobe Premiere which is at the time of writing still a x86 application, which also has to run through Rosetta 2 for translation. of course the performance will be degraded. once we see more than apples own applications adapt native ARM64 support expect the performance to match or at least come close to a 3080.
Does bootcamp work on these M1 Macs ?
What? You look like 26 lol.
Thank for keeping it real #subscribing
Dave2D at 4:20 - "I'm 40 right?" Me (thinking he was in his mid 20s this entire time): Right
what is unbelievable is not the battery life of these devices, its that Dave is 40! What?!!  Oh and by the way, thanks for reminding me I don't need this, saved me an impulse purchase. :-)
Hey Dave, currently a M1 MBA owner, would you say that the M1Max MBP 13 make any significant upgrade over M1 MBA for such price. I don't do anything professional with my laptop, but mostly for Netflix and streaming TV shows so the display and speaker quality is important to me. Is the new 2021 MBP display and speakers any significantly better compared to M1 MBA?
the whole takeaway of this video is how the hell are you 40?????
The subtle takeaway from one of the earlier comparisons was how well the 13" M1 performed relative to the base 14" M1Pro w/8 cores (6+2 v 4+4). Still a lot of value in the M1.
Just love the fact that you speak as one of our own. You give only the necessary comparisons and information for the consumer. I watch nearly all your videos and learn a lot. Thanks for doing this for us and urself bro!
"Everything is good when you go thick." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Best video on the topic right now 👌
It's irritating Apple deems a 15/16" screen as a 'Pro' feature. That's all I want out of this new machine, give me the internals of the Air w/larger screen. Done, sold.
I'd make the upgrade straight away, if the software I required for work were compatible with M1.
You can use Parallels (Windows) on M1 chipped MAcs? Didn’t know that.
You are 40 what? 40 days until you are 30?
if Apple have no problem to make its MBP thicker, why do it have to make its screen bezel thinner but with additional notch. Why don't just keep the last year screen and then publish a comment that it won't compromise the webcam quality just for the sake thinner bezel. it's not like the last year MBP is ugly and cheap looking.  btw, good review as always Dave.
Dave is 40, he looks 30 at most!
Informative and funny as hell :D
T.H.I.C.C 😍
Not a fan of this review.  You come off as an apologist for Apple every time there is a slightly negative thing you have to excuse it.  I understand, from all we have seen thus far, that these laptops are the best of the best but it's just obnoxious.  It's okay to criticize your $2k-$3k purchase dude.  Btw, I'm not an Apple hater.  I'm literally typing this on my M1 Air right now but also own a gaming PC and work on a Windows laptop (finance) so I get a healthy dose of each "ecosystem" (god I hate that term, it's so fucking pretentious).
Wow and I picked up the dell xps 13 9310... no ports and have to spend extra for the option of ports... still might pick one up just to have one or might giveaway my xps to family.
You are 40??? How??? You look like 25 to me. Too fit to be old man.
ur 40?? 😳😳
Could anyone tell me if I should get a Razer blade 14 3060/70, Zephyrus g15 3070/80 or the new 14 inch MacBook Pro with the 10 core M1 pro and 16 core gpu I am looking for a laptop than can deliver great performance
40!!! really ?? Dude you look like 19. I never knew you so old... SHOCKED !!
So 14 inch or 16
I thought Dave was late 20s. Good for you, others get jealous
“Everything is good when you go thicc” wow Dave calm down i thought this was a review of a laptop….
Slown down a bit, and get cohesive, teleprompter?
If u cover the logo white girls are gonna look at it like “ew is a gross old laptop 🤢”       Sry white ppl 😂 But yk wut I mean
3:35 and that sold me. The moment I can save up enough, I’m getting one. If it can replace my gaming pc, I’m happy.
Been waiting for this woohoo
He's 40 years old? OH MY GOD
Man🤣🤣🤣 that voice change 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i bought the new macbook as soon as it came out its coming with delivery soon and im hyped i really want to see its gaming performance in real life lol
40?! FORTY?! Sir. I thought you were early 30’s.
Really? GFXBench? Are you fucking serious?
I have professional needs, I am currently using 2017 MBP, but if I ever get the chance I will update to mac mini. Hopefully they will launch it with M1 max soon.
Did you mean to say 2013 13 inch MacBook Pro, or 2020 13 inch MacBook Pro? Because the 2013 is way out of the picture at this point in time.
This is fishy. There is none in the aquarium...
YOU'RE 40????
40???????
That last part did hit me hard. I know where it's coming from, Dave.
"They are just tools" ..that is still sinking in...
Windows needs it's M1 moment :(
You're 40 please tell us your secrets
Could you go into more detail on how you were running Overwatch? What settings?
"Everything's good when you go thicc." Council of men approved!
Really quick & awesome 👍
"They are cool but tools". Thank you for that statement. Even for an enthusiast photographer like me, I can import 1400 images onto my M1 Macbook air (16gb) and edit them in Lightroom classic with relative ease. For the pro's that need the speed and capability, the M1 pro and max is a no brainer. For most of us regular Joes, maybe look for deals on refurbished M1 machines? Thats where I got mine.
Gonna be going to school for “Interactive Arts & Systems” at Simon Fraser U in Canada, going to be working with beginner level coding, designing, and 3D animation/modelling. Would a device like this be for me or should i go with a 13 Air?
Best reviews ever
Dave, I’d be upgrading from a mid 2009 MacBook Pro. I think it would be worthwhile.
And you just keep them...that is so cool 😎
These are Tools. Thanks man.
Why No vs M1 GPU??? EXCELLENT closing words man!!!!!!! Best Regards!!!
at first I hated the notch but the way they implemented it is pretty cool
Notch has to go! That looks so damn cheap compared to the Dell.
I feel like ever since Jony Ive left apple their designs are getting a bit more practical than just good looking.
I like how these look, reminds me of my olllld mac. Also thank god for sd card
Dave's reviews have the highest quality content / min density of any YT review. No BS. No boring irrelevant intros. Immediately hits all the relevant issues that we all want to hear about. Thank you Dave for doing God's work.
the idea behind these laptops is cool but the notch and thickness completely ruins it. from the outside it looks like some of the og macbooks
I'm a programmer and I want to get the best, but I just hate the size of 16-inch. Would I be loosing a lot of extra power and capabilities getting the 14-inch?
Agree I’m sold by the specs but the M1 air is doing awesome for my needs.
Man, just do right tests, why you are trying to cover Apple? Waiting from other people tests, because it's not.
Everything's great when you go thicc
14 inch high refresh rate MacBook with MagSafe is very temping. Dave is right tho, I don’t use my laptop for professional work and I love my M1 Air
Notch annoys me less on bigger screens. But I think Apple could have made it smaller.  Then again, I'm never buying an Apple device.
You crushed it man. I've been waiting for this. Thanks
"I'm 40"  fucking what ?!
Very nice conclusion 👌
I'm kinda happy these are a lot more expensive than I was expecting, 'cause now I have one more reason to stick to my M1 Air.
As usual one of the best tech reviews. Always honest, that’s why we love you!
#GetDaveToStopUsingPremiere
I need that hoodie!
WhAt blOOm?!?
wait for M2 macbook air ...they will kick intel off the cliff  hehe
“Everything’s good when you go thick.” That’s what she said.
The most shocking thing about this video is that Dave is 40. Wtf? You look like a late 20s guy. In your early 30s at worst
I’m starting to expect how the new MacBook Air looks like.
useful information.
wtfff duude, you don't look like 40 yo  You looking fresh!
40?
Bro I’m 41 you look maybe 31
'Im 40, right and-'   *What he say?*
Damn annoying i just bought the m1 macbook air -.-
Dave was quoting his dad when he said he’s 40.
I’ll tell you what…if a leather case company can get on it…they can develop a case that covers this frumpy design and make it beautiful (and protected) on the outside and beautiful on the inside.
I wonder why people use crippled, horribly inefficient and poorly designed software like Premiere, then complain that the hardware is to blame for slow performance.
If this thing had HDMI 2.1 and lacked a notch, I would buy it RIGHT AWAY
"Everything is good when u go thicc" LMAO
the trackpad was literally the reason i changed to apple in the first place lol
Wait …… he’s 40???
hey Dave can you show us you playing overwatch or other AAA games on the 14in?
First time when Apple went with a design closer to another brand like Razer?  Joking here, but I really prefer a boxy shape (probably dbrand will do as well, and fans of their decals when putting those on) Performance and price wise... uhm... I 100% agree with you. If it's not an investmenr ie. make money with this machine AND surpass the breakeven point, then you're better off with something else, even an older gen of Macbooks if you really want to scratch that Apple itch.
Can we have Granpa Dave back more often ?
wtf at first I thought the macbooks were 3d renders. Damn
28"
damn it's thicc
You're 40?!!??
My main question is After Effects rendering and do you think the numbers for Premiere and AE will drastically improve once the programs optimize for M1 Pro/Max? I know the beta are not very impressive right now compared to native FCP or Davinci Resolve.
wym, Dave. you're not 40. you are prob in the late 20s. or early 30s max to max.
FOR. TY. ?!??!
The notch on a laptop... I still just can't
I recently started watching yours videos and I'm just gonna say it...you're literally the most honest reviewer on YouTube thanks for what you do 🥰
No way you are 40!
how you compare sound quality on 14 and 16?
They are basically asking big corporates to buy these for their employees, by sacrificing the exterior design.
dave loves thickness 1:10
I love this guy.  Also great review
MacBook Performance aside, you're 40?!!!! You don't look a day over 30!
You're 40?? You look like 30.
Dave: *Everything is good when you go thicc* Me and the rest of the internet: *I agree with your statement*
I never thought u were 40! 40yr old with a Megatron 😂
*ALSO, Dell's upper frame is bigger.*
It's not about favoring Apple's apps.  They use Metal.  It's about the hardware having codecs for Apple's formats (namely, ProRes) accelerated in hardware. Any apps that support ProRes should get the boost.  Did you test Premier's performance on your Windows laptop while it was on battery against the new Macs?  One more thing:  THE NEW MACBOOK PROS AREN'T MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE ONES BEING REPLACED.
I expect that a cup of coffee or orange juice or an espresso falls on it in the morning and makes the MacBook worth $3500 like a toaster!! So🙄😐 Will Apple give us the right to repair?🙄🤨
"Everything's good when you go thicc" Wise words Dave
"Everything is good when you go thick"  -dave2d
2000 USD for an entry model of the smaller size is just daylight robbery!
What kind of idiot uses premiere? 🤯🤯🤯🤡🤡🤡🌍🌍🌍
I have to disagree on them being too expensive. I don’t need a high end computer to make a living but do buy  a MacBook Pro every 5-6 years. It is the only computer I own during that time. And I wouldn’t blink an eye at spending like 3k USD for 5-6 years worth of use.
Thank you Dave for reminding us that this craving we feel is just a WANT and not a NEED kinda situation. Ok people, let’s all repeat to ourselves… We don’t need this!! It’s insanely tempting but we need food and financial security better. 😜😇🙏
I thought u were 25 man, impressive!
5:07 my man nf 🤘
Is it worth it for me to get the base model 14"? I am a software developer looking for a laptop, and from a lot of models, this fits my needs the best:   Hdmi, Great battery life,  Great speakers, Usb c charging  I am a windows user currently but can adapt fast.  Also, I live in Spain, so all laptops by default have Qwerty Spanish keyboard with the "ñ". Apple is the only one allowing me to choose qwerty International, which is a deal breaker for me, I need it to be qwerty international.
Four minutes in and all I've heard it "fabulous stickers" and "Windows games at 120hz".  Awful, awful review.  Thanks for wasting 4 minutes of my life.
Tools...i dont think so...16" display and better battery life as well as no crazy fans....
I live for these intros
“They are just tools” 👏🏻👏🏻
“Like I’m 40”… Damn  I’m sorry, I’m sorry
Some world-class quotes in this vid...
Everyone watching: "you are...40???????"
The performance is whether you are on power or on battery. Second, its not as thick or hot as windows laptop running a high powered cpu plus a high powered gpu.
Compared to what I've blown on audio equipment and cars for "fun", these MacBooks are the best value for "fun purchase"
Thanks Dave
dayem, 40?? you look like 30 or younger!!!
They look Busting
Hey Dave, mind sharing the green/blueish/cyan wallpaper on 14" MBP? (1:35) Looks dope :)
They sure are tools over at apple. That's for sure.
When the Fam watches the BTS concert so you need the HDMI
Might wanna credit Kurzgesagt for the beautiful dino animations?
Wait. So did I hear him right, after all this, Premiere Pro won't run any better? sigh...
Dave could pass for 30
Love the concise review... that last note about them just being "tools" so as not to make an impulse buy was a sobering one. Good stuff.
*You're 40?? What the fuck mate??*
40?!  You look like a tired 30 at best.
You said your 40, you think we will fall for it!  We all know your are on your 20's
I need the pro one....🤔🤔🤔
ty dave for stopping me from that dumb purchase decision there at the end
I am still trying to figure out if the m1 max would even be able to compete for 3D task. And I'm left with a what was Apple thinking. So the GPU sits between a mobile 3060 and 3070. So assuming it could match cuda performance in cycles because that is the only data i can actually readily find benchmark data for. Like I know redshift has been optimized for metal but I haven't been able to find any actual benchmarks and the only thing I've seen is annecdotal evidence of some guy saying hey we went from 20 minutes per render to 40 s followed by videos after that article showing minutes per render. But without actual benchmarks it's hard to tell. But assuming metal in cycles x matches cuda which is a big if a m1 max should take 3.1x the time to render as a 16GB mobile 3080 or a mobile A5000 due to Nvidia having ray accelerators. So if you are a Character modeler, annimator, texture artist, even a game environment artist PC is 3x faster and you aren't likely to exceed the 16 GB frame buffer. Now if you are one of the guys going over 16GB you are likely in the movie industry and looking at the full scene at which point 64 GB just isn't enough I mean there were some industry professionals speculating that the 256GB on threadrippper systems might not be enough. Yeah I dunno. I would be more optimistic if I could find redshift benchmarks using metal showing actual performance but as of right now it's super expensive while not being actually faster. I mean they showed this cool thing with the original enterprise and being able to do a cross-section which was cool but without some way to actually see it or benchmark or something, it's hard to draw conclusions though I imagine some people will buy it all the same and insist it's the best thing since sliced bread.
That is the video I’ve been waiting for
Are you 40? Whaaaatttt... I don't care about the laptop, you don't look that "old", you look like 30 meeeennn
That old man voice LOL
i do love thick things too, 😉.
What a wonderful excuse for just having hdmi 2.1 ... :D :D :D :D  Excellent job to sell, as usual.... :D :D :D
Dave 2D is 40?!?
If only there was a cheaper 16inch with standard M1 chip for people who want all those new features and bigger display but don’t need that crazy performance
Gasped and paused to reflect when you said you're 40.
DAVE IS 40?! I full own thought he was early 30-33
How are you 40?? Don’t mess with me now. I’m 27 and you look my age.
Touchbar is great to skip Youtube ads on Safari.. Especially now that Youtube is annoyingly pushing 2 ads at times..
YOU'RE 40???? I THOUGHT YOU'RE LIKE 28
Can someone give the link of the wallpapers?
Yup it's because you are 40. Incan 2nd that
Dave: I'm 40. Me: Waaaaaaat
IMHO, it is not up to you to advise that one should not get one of these machine for the fun. Unless you are their financial adviser, which your probably not. In a free society, peoplea entitled to a fun the way they one, as long as they do not hurt others (do not want to be moralistic)
you're 40 ? sir?
Thanks for review and kudos for kurzgesagt
When dave said he is 40 I instantly noticed his mid aged face, otherwise he was mid 20s for me this whole time.
…I’m 40
Tools?  Magic tools they are. Precssshhhhoooouuuuus!
Benchmarks yay!
This guy looks like 20 not 40 🤣🤣🤣😩
Absolutely love that ending…they’re tools! So true and I think too many of us get caught up in the hype. Thanks for keeping it real. Great video!
Thank you, Im getting the high-end 14" next week :)
Very honest review! Awesome
So this is the Laptop for YouTubers who export videos.   But what about the rest of us????
Review?? You've had these. Achines for less than a couple weeks... How can you make a review??
40 where!??!😳
The background looks a bit cluttered         😜
I have the now old MacBook, I mean wow this new upgrade is great. I think they should add the Touch Bar to the air versions
Expensive as hell damn. Truly unnecessary for 90% of people
They are tools and my dad always used to say "buy the best tools you can afford".
And because you said it is not for fun tools now people will want to buy it for fun tools even if its expensive lol
Dave: I'm 40. Me: Excuse me whaaaaaat!!? 🤯
Aint no way you 40. Thought you was like 25-30. Anyway, What do you think about the 14" with the 10c for 2400. Seems like the perfect sweet spot to me.  Because for that price its beating basically everything else dollar/perf.
I was trying to justify ordering that 16" bad boy ,, so that last phrase spoke directly to me XD
why the hell trackpad's taking more than half of the laptop
As expected, all that performance at low wattage is just pure software optimization. That's what happens when you've stringent control over both hardware and software...
Guess what ?Dave behind the desk once again.
You're 40? WTF!!
What windows laptop are you sticking with?
Hahah that blue part was funny what blue 😂
As always an nice vid. I am 40 too :)
You are 40 years? You look 24 :O
Apple actually did a good job with these laptops that are for pros lol
YOU’RE 40?????
Bloom? what bloom? 🤣cracked me up
You can actually in 120 FPS wit the Mac now ?!
Wow the compute power is so disappointing...keeping my Razor with a 2070.
you're FORTY???? DUDE YOU LOOK UNDER 30
Make thick the new normal
“I’m 40.”  Screw these reviews; I need to know what you’re doing to look like that at your age!
1:17  Do I even need to say anything?
A tech review video with that ending!! . such a genuine perspective, it is a tool.. you don't need it don't buy it
Loved what you said, “they are really cool but they are tools” most of us forget about it!! Awesome review! ✌🏽
Wow, the design is 95% the same of the macbook from 2009. What really bother me is complacency of youtubers saying that the design is great and love chunky laptops, no one likes heavy thick bricks. Last note, I own an 13 m1 air...that one is magical
YOU'RE 40!!! you could've passed as late 20s/30s
So basically the performance was overhyped by Apple. The M1 was more of a gamechanger
Notch is stupid, especially without FaceID and CenterStage and quality of webcam is irrelevant - these used to date are fine, as mostly the picture is displayed on fraction of screen anyway.
Everything's good when you go thick!
i think That was the Best presentation ever Dave
lol hearing Dave being 40 is like hearing Apple getting rid of the notch: not impossible, just take a really LONG time for it to be apparent
Btw I was so shook to learn you’re 40, I had to pause the video. I thought you were at least in your early 30’s.
"They are just tools" (fine talk)
YOU'RE 40?!?
Thanks for your review. As a Premier and Photoshop editor, for the 14 what configuration you suggests?
Everyone saying they are thick. They just appear thicker because they don’t have a tapered design anymore.   The 14” is actually THINNER then the 13” and the 16” is half a millimeter thicker then the intel 16”.
Dave - I'm 40  Me - WHAAAATTT !!!!
As always, Straight to the point, objective reviews, best-in-class....btw, your face doesn't match your age, you look 10 years younger or more.
This was really well thought out.Dave. Actually made me change my mind, thanks!
There's no way Dave is as old as my dad...
never thought I would go back to macbook pros but these laptops are so nice. Might buy myself the 16' inch one pretty soon. Most excited ive been for laptop in a long time
What are the specs of these laptops you're presenting beyond just the cores?  How much memory did you purchase for each?
“Everything’s good when you go thick” 😂😂
I am not a mac user, so when he says at 3:22 "i threw parallels in here" what does that mean? is it a windows emulator or some sorts?
Cool tools
Need to buy a 16” MacBook Pro to play Slither.io
I really didn't think you are over 35!
honestly, I don't know what to do with the stickers. like where should I even stick it to!?
Wait.. YOU'RE 40????? I thought you're only 30... Damnnn
I appreciate your closing statement, lots of people buy things just because they are new and "better" without ever considering if they actually need them or not. Great video  overall!
I don't understand why everyone is going crazy on these devices? Thickness gives you more ports? Seriously, did you even compare with compition? Ex, XPS! I don't see thickness.   The only good part of these devices are their chips performance. Other than that is so horrible that these tech been out 3 years ago.
so moral of the story get a 100w 3080 for alot less money
excuse me....40!? i thought you were 30 at best!
I saw the NF clip 🖤
Is the keyboard section unibody with just different color or is it a separate chassis?
Im still gonna pick one for fun
M1 Max 10C+32G Single Core-11700K Level Multi Core-3700X Level GFXBench-1080Ti Level Tomb Raider-1070 Level
Everything's good when you go thick... That's the best quote of the year 💯
I really appreciate the talk of reality Dave. You are correct. These are pro tools for pro people who definitely have a use for them. Very well said!💯
THICK (THICC) is the key word
Biggest wonder in this video - "I'm 40"
They are nice, but I will stick to my MacBook Air M1.  I am more interested in the next gen 27 inch iMac (or whatever size they make them).
Wow I had no idea you're 40!! You literally look like late 20s!
14 or 16 with the same apple max?
They really are something. Gonna be a hard slog for Intel/AMD/Nvidia to catch up.
Looking at these reminds me of the OG Aluminium Macs.. Apple did a Full Circle on the exterior looks :D... Steve Jobs reaction would have been priceless to this.
Wow, never would have guessed you were 40.  Looking good.
Forget about tech reviews, you should make vids about how to look 20 when you're 40! SHOCKING. 😯
I don't like face id...touch id more secure in my environment.
Whats going on i 6:05???
That notch is dumb.
7:49 the click sound of closing screen impressed me!
Think of how many times you would use Face ID on that laptop compared to your phone, is it really worth it? Even at this price.  And you can’t really compare it to the windows hello thing either, as it’s a much simpler feature.
There no face id cause Many use mask dis days on work
You're 40?!?
Best ending quote ever. Great review Dave! From 🇦🇺
YOUR ARE 40!!!
most interesting thing about this video is learning that he is 40
Every software developer's wet dream
Dave2D is freaking FORTY???????????
"whassup, port. plug it up!"
I am giving away a black black apple sticker if you hit thumbs up.
"Everything's good when you go THICK." - Dave2D
Can we just appreciate the fact how well he can mimic his future self😀😀😂.
"There are really cool, but there are tools, that's what they are" touch me, i changed from 8TB to 2tb and 64 ram to 32, the rest is maxed, xD
You're 40!!! Dave, April's Fool is still 6x months away - jk aside, another 👍 review
Dave, I love your videos but this one feels like it wasn't not in depth.
7:53 Watch people who can't afford buy this to impress people who they don't even like anyways.
500 Apple fanboys don't like this video :)
Woo! WTF you're 40? You REALLY don't look like it! I wouldn't give you past 30, more like 28 maybe 29 if you'd be smokin'
I would love to see how the notch is affecting the usage. On full screen will the tabs spread into two ?
40? You look like 27 or less
we need mic test :(
Your age reveal definitely shocked me. But now I hope to be this cool at age 40.
Love the closing comments: "...these are just too expansive to pick up as a fun purchase. They're really cool, but they're tools. That's all they are." Nailed it.
Can't wait for every damn manufacturer to make the same distasteful notch on their device 😭
Did he just said I'm 40 😲😲
"everything's good when you go thicc"
Man he is 40
Once Intel and AMD start making 5nm chips, will windows also be as energy laptops?   The ending is what we all need to hear from the sneaker heads, tech influencers,   salesmen, etc.
The last part you said was so true there are so many people that know nothing about technology and just to be with the newest they spend so much money even though there is almost no improvement to the device like iPhone 12pro max and the 13 pro max, small battery change, a tiny bit better camera and the refresh screen. Don't be rich and dumb be aware of everything and why you would need!
“Everything’s good when you go thicc “, Dave2D
Lool Apple Stickers... hahaha
Ending "They are Tools. That's it!"👌👌👌👌 You don't review a product as a reviewer, but you review them as a normal user who uses them in daily life. This makes you different. Also, the purchase decision becomes easier due to these kind of reviews. By the way, I thought your age is maximum 28 years 😅
That's a nice looking hoodie
1:12 dude 😂😂😂
Now we wait for the 2019 16-inch MBP to drop in price 😁
the only unbiased review
Well that went quick
I could have sworn you weren't even 30 and you're 40. Wow
That battery life is woeful.
MBA M1 still the best choice for most who want/need a Mac.
I was under the impression Premiere Pro already had M1 optimisation and they were quite a bit faster. So saying MacBook Pro didn't get any benefits seems strange to me.
"Everything is good when you go thick" _Dave2D, 2021
Great vid as already.. side note where do you get your hoodies?😬
"Everything's good when you go thick."
I’ll take the XPS no-notch webcam over the MacBook Pro notch webcam any day, why? I never use my webcam, and do you really ever need top tier quality to make a Skype call anyway? Lmao
" before you'd have to get the dongle, people would be panicking, the world would be on fire, but now you're like whats-up, port, you plug it up."
40 is the new 20
Everything is good when you go thick .... 🤣🤣🤣🤣can't stop myself
0:55 You MONSTER
I would be so happy for a non-Pro Macbook 14, without miniLED and Promotion, with the non-Pro/Max chip, but the new chassis with the ports (at least, just the ports) and the colors of the new iMac 24 for the replacement of the actual MacBook Air/Pro 13. Just imagine that thing costing around 1200$ ! It would be so amazing, the laptop to buy for pretty everyone !
So I use Logic Pro Full time for music production, and have loved my ASS TIER 2016 i5 MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar, but finally have been maxing out it’s abilities since about Jan 2020, I think these are the perfect model for me, I ordered a 16 inch M1 Pro with 2 TB ssd and 32 gigs of unified memory, I do edit video with Premeire professionally as well, and I think this will still be a hell of a long term upgrade for me!!
1:17 “Everything is good when you go thick”, I can't agree with you more
WHAT?! You‘re 40?! I feel, like you look, like 20. However, I am 56. Anyway, your 40 surprised the hell out of me.
Thanks for the video. I actually went recently for a lenovo legion 7 rtx3080, ryzen 9, 32gb ram and 2Tb ssd that I think is amazing for 3D modeling, texturing and gaming. Also the screen is incredible. And comes at half price compared to these macs😊. But as you said. They do look cool 😂😎
Dave2D Teal gang before Squid Game 🤣
Lol ? How are you 40 😳😳 you look more like 28🤩
The Most Ugly Laptop of 2021 🤢 -  WTH 🍏 🍏
Damn 40? Always thought late 20s for some reason?
So, 0 demerit. Sounds like a complete promotional video.
Great closing.
Im sayin it, Dave2D is the best tech reviewer on Youtube by far. He gave me everything I wanted to know in  8min. He keeps it real and ignores the hype.  No extra fluff, just what you want.
Are you 40?????????
ur not 40 tf
The only thing that shocked me on this review is that this guy is 40! 🙄
“everything’s good when you go thick”  aw yeah!
They are really cool, but they are tools. Exactly, don't get overhyped, love them though.
I thought I'd be surprised by benchmarks, but I'm surprised by Dave's age
Omg you are 40?? I thought you were like 30
"everything's good when you go thicc"🤣
So the performance is not that hi compared to 3060 laptop? Ouh ok...
Apple : I wish the vidéo stopped in the 8:00 minute..
He said BTS concert with a sad face lmbo
You think it can support max carriers and mutas from gold megaton in SC2 for 4v4? Have you tried it if yes then this could be mine next computer
I refuse to believe you aren't 20
The Premiere benchmark was super helpful to put this in context. I, too, thought this would be a beast with rendering but if it's not much better than my windows machine, there's no rush to grab this.
40... damn dave lol
Can the mouse rest under the notch, or does it skip across?
I thought you were 30, when you said 40 I went like: "no way, he is lying" 🤣
Dang bro u look like 25 dude
You're 40 ! You Look so young, maybe he wanted to say 30
6:48 disappointing results. same with the gamibg results before that
Space grey or silver?
Everything smooth when it goes thick 👌🏻 01:13
Thanks for your message at the end about not buying if u don’t need it. Bc I so wanna buy one. I purchased my last one a mbp 13 inch about two years ago and opened it about 30 times 😂
Display: 2021 Performance: 2022 Speaker: 2022 Design: 2004 😂
You're FORTY?
5:30 Apple is to HDMI and MagSafe as McDonalds' is to McRib
What if you’re needing to edit BRAW in Resolve? That supports M1 but not sure about M1 Max. How much faster would that be from a top of the line 2010 MacPro with a PCIe editing drive and Saphire 7970 graphics card?
How is Dave playing overwatch on a Mac? Is he using Bootcamp?
This illiterate troll is again making videos on higher tech products lol
I didn't know you did battery tests with 60hz.
Hello,  I am from India and I love your unboxing and comparison.   Can I get a favor?
There was zero PRO review on how these can be utilized. Zero 3DS MAX Cinema 4d review, zero animation review, zero Final Cut Pro review, this is a PRO computer and you didn’t use the PRO features. This isn’t a ordinary laptop this is for us PRO users.
Would I benefit from 64 ram now or in the future for gaming?
Love you honest opinion👍
In the video rendering comparison I wish there was Davinci Resolve. Otherwise great review!
He went so safe with new MacBook Pro 😅😅
40? 40 freaking what?
2:08 webcam looks fine to me. shit wencam is fine when no one really cares about webcam for online stuff
Everything is good when you go thick. I'll have to agree with that Dave
No way you're 40 Dave. You don't look a day older than 25
Old Man Dave and his Cataracts. The bloom is built in 😉
apple going backwards
Black sticker is a game changer
You're 40?!?!?!
Dave is 40?? He looks 29
So it looks like software that is natively ported for m1 so far runs similarly or better than a 3080 mobile. Running x86 emulation takes a big performance it, but that's still impressive.
I got to use them today...and they are THICCCCC! Also, the notch is fuckign stupid. The mouse goes through it!!! THATS NOT GOOOOOOD!!! Stop saying this is good...its just sad!
The ending is best yet!
40? No way! 🤔
Dave Getting Older, Dave getting Wiser 8:20
I heard A LOT of people say "why there's a notch without Face ID?! It doesn't make sense!", but maybe they don't know the dimensions of a webcam module. "Notch" doesn't mean "Face ID", it means "we need space to put something that covers part of the screen", and for a 1080p webcam that space can't be too little. Yeah, maybe the shape of the notch could have been smoother than this, literally a rectangle that clashes with the aesthetics of these laptops, but I am not so disappointed.. I mean, there's a high quality webcam..!! Anyway, PERSONALLY I prefer having only touch ID on my computer, I don't consider face ID so much safe
Love your reviews for their impartial perspective.
This has to be amongst his best videos! ❤️
"Everything is good when you go thicc"- Dave 2021
Xcode performance?
MacBook became famous for thinner and sexier style, but now they’re going back to the old laptop style - heavier and bulkier. In short, they’re saying the competitor were or are far ahead of them 😜
YOU'RE 40?!
Excellent review! Love the lighting on you as well!
I think the thin and elegant design will come back one day. I personally love it. We were not ready for it . Maybe in the future when cooling and ports are no longer problem then it would come back.
"Thickness gives you ports" I disagree. There are laptops half the thickness with all the ports this MacBook has
" everything is good when you go thicc " -Dave2D
MacBook review comes out Dave: I’m 40 Everyone: whaatttttt
How the fuck are you 40
Dave you're NF fan?
Can you do a deep learning benchmark with tensorflow between the I9 and the M1 Max model?
You are 25 at max, stop lying d2d
I appreciate your last statement, it’s a tool.
Are you 40 for real?
don't care if i don't need m1 max for compiling docker images. im still getting one
40??? Thought you were 25 at most
The only reason I bought one is because I can't natively connect multiple external monitors to my m1 macbook air. I don't understand how people can live with one external display. (I know you can use displaylink to connect multiple, but I use 2 4k displays and one 144hz 1440p, so it wouldn't work well)
Whaaaaaaaatttt ?  You are 16 bro ! Not 40
7:00 that green bar is why you should not use Premiere
But.. but they are thicc.. and you said this is good :)
5:19 based family
bruh, u look deadass 20
Everything's good when you go thicc. - Dave2D 2021
YOU'RE 40??????
You’re 40? Holy
My God, it's like Apple gets it (again - the post-Jobs era has been a TouchBar-infested nightmare wilderness)
Boom!!!! His content is boom 💥😀✌️
had to click through ijustine's recommended video to find the good review
I've been watching ur videos for almost 4 years now I didn't know ur age until now wtf 40 how ??I'm 23 and I look way older then u look 25 max good 4 u
Everything is good when you go T H I C C
i died on " BLOOM!!! WHATTT BLOOOMMM??? "
did he just say hes 40?
Everythings good when you go thicc  - Dave 2021
would you recommend it for gaming ?
Loved the old impression. Dead on🤘😂
They are cool but they are just tools and too expensive for normal user ❤️ Yeah you are right for normal user macbook air m1 with 512 gb storage is enough 😀
Well it's now more expensive than a Kidney I guess.
bud you are not old you are getting younger and younger love to watch your videos........love from india
You're 40 ????????
Thanks for great review, you mentioned lot of things that I thought before. And I know now, that I don't need it :-)
Your last comment nailed the point; most people don't need this cool tool.
I love your videos because you're a window user still don't miss out on appreciating apple product. And also keep money and worth of product in mind.
Good point Dave.. This are Pro Tools.. Pick this Pro's if you really need it...
Great job, as always keeping it real 👏
My org ordered a few of these for the marketing team, but its funny you mentioned the HDMi port being used in a pinch and its weird because I feel like if your a Apple person working in a none Apple work space you HAVE to plug it in. My org is a Microsoft based org and we are deep in the Microsoft business eco system and it makes Other Pro work flawless. But its always the came guys that come in and are instantly like "Can you put that on my Mac" and im like nope gatta plug it in.  You ended this with the best line ever "there tools" 100% agreed.
He's not really 40 right?
Dave is an avid Overwatch gamer. Respect to keep it going
I really need to know how this works in Unreal/Unity Game development workflow
Loved your comments/conclusion. Dont buy it if there isnt a need.
You are not 40
Which laptop would you pick, one of these or your existing razer blade :)
Ey man I need your advice, what laptop to buy if I use premier pro and lightroom for edits something fast since you say these are not faster than your windows laptop or desktop
"I like the THICC-ness." - Dave2D 2021
Best line ever for general consumers."They are really cool, but they are tools"-Dave 2D. M1 air and pro still strong, better battery, even better value now with a price drop in some platforms.
YOU'RE 40? WTF
ayanokoji's fans : everyone is just tool to me nothing id different in this device than humans
But i wanna show it off at Starbucks while i browse the internet
HDMI port's first use is to stream a BTS concert - love it
Flexin' at 40... xD
yo can we talk about how good dave still looks despite being 40? 🤯
Nice bro 🙂👍☺️    https://youtu.be/4Reoby3UzfY
"Everything's good when you go thick". Dang right haha
The way you saw him think about if he really wants to say they wanted to watch the BTS concert🤣
Can't believe you're 40 man. Loved your comment at the end about the temptations of buying these new machines. More people need to hear it said plainly like that. Great video Dave!
I just had spare few thousands of dolllar that i did not need for anything meaningfull so i decided to spend it on a laptop. Damn morons!
Wait wait. Overwatch is out for M1?
40! I would like to know what your lifestyle is, you look like 33 tops.
“Everything Is good when you go thick” -Dave2D, tech reviewer and a wise man.
5:07 any NF fans?
Hi there, can you confirm there is real 1000 nits in normal use (without HDR)?
Iphone PRO *Sheeeeeeeesh*
5:05 wow i love u for that one.
2:06 Are you sure Dave? I recall the 480p apple Webcam meme being hilarious for a VERY long time.
Nice video as always, love the clarity of infos. Might roll back to a 2020 MBP M1 then :)
Advice on memory options?
What's up with the graphics corruption at 6:58?
You’re FORTY?
Spend more money = get a sticker
1:17 indeed, EVERYTHING is good when you go thicc
Expensive too.
You’re 40…..? Wow
Excellent ending.
Didn't think I'd see the MacBook Pro be less attractive then the new MS & XPS machines...
"Everything's good when you go thicc" - words to live by, Prayge in the chat boys
Im just here hoping to justify my somewhat impulsive purchase.
i'm really excited to see how c4d / redshift / octane perform on these little beasts . Maybe you can help me with that. Thanks!
I’m sorry did he just say 40… I though he was like in his late 20s, early 30s.
The 16" is SO going to be my next laptop.
I have the previous generation i9 MacBook Pro 16".  Should I upgrade to this one?  Seems like I won't get a huge benefit yet.  I use the Adobe Suite of tools and also do streaming.
I totally disagree with the ugly Notch, I don't like it at all! MacBook Air M1 16GB 1TB without any fan and TouchBar is still a better choice!
Everything is good when you go thicc this will be my rule of life XD
I appreciate your insights, Dave. Got me thinking I'll probably wait for a while. Old man voice was ON POINT!!
"Everything's good when you go thick" Me: i couldnt agree more!
haha appreciate the last comment. I really don't need it. Maybe I'll pick up two MacBook airs for my wife and I instead of one of these for me. The M1 is a decent machine for what I need, and I definitely don't need the pro or max
I watched this review first. Then I watched other guys reviews. Then I came back here and I watched it again. Dave clearly has the best, the most mature expertise in terms of laptops. This is just undeniable.
Very good and concise review!!! (:
waiting for the Max brothers review. This review is too much essential. Compare these laptops vs Asus Proart equivalent otherwise we don’t understand if we have to move forever on Mac Books for the rest of our life.
"They're tools, that's why they are" exactly.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would like to see thiknes comparizon vs 2013-2015 macs.
Right TO REPAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For coding project
I bought a macbook pro in the summer, should I trade it in and upgrade?
I really need one, wish I could afford it.
Dave - the man!
How did he run Overwatch on the Mac?
Funny how Dave hypes the shit of so many other (Windows) laptops, some which cost upwards of $4K, but when it comes to this one, that blows them all away in most aspects, suddenly "its just a tool, you don't need it" and all of you are praising him so much for that line. Funny how suddenly this only applies because its an Apple product. I guess that was for all the anti-Apple trolls in the comments.
DAVE IS 40?
'Everything is good when u go thick'
Great and to the point. I'd sub to this channel multiple times if I could.
Biggest takeaway from this is finding out Dave is 40 😌
Only tech channel where I'm subscribed..Real world user, only honest reviewer.
I was expecting the webcam to be better honestly. The increase in quality isn't enough to justify the notch imo.
So buy the previous one instead?
Everything's good WHEN you go thick ! - Dave's got the clue here !
If the Webcam is shit quality it doesn't need to be more than 700 dollars
40? 🧐🤔
8:20 "They're really cool, but they're tools!" If I can just remember this statement, I wouldn't change my smartphone and make a lot of impulse purchases so frequently 😔. Thanks Dave!
"I'm 40..." *hold X to doubt* haha
Everything's good when you go thicc🌚🌚
I wanted either a Mac Mini Pro or that the next gen Macbooks have more ports or at least the new MBP 13" gets an upgrade to actually make it different from the Macbook air.
wtf you can get it with an 8TB SSD?! dang that's huge (and only $2200 haha!)
Wow looking at the screen, I’m glad they took off the “MacBook Pro” sign on the bottom, it looks much better when watching videos!
I’ve been looking into this laptop more and more, i want to use it for work but also thinking about using it for gaming when Xcloud launches on IOS, any thoughts?
Dave's on a roll.
Holy shit you don’t look 40! You look more like late 20’s. Damn what you taking smh
I'm relieved to know my laptop is still faster 🙂
Damn you have it already? Mines coming tomorrow 😍
You are 40 🙄🙄🙄
"Everything is good when you go thick" - Dave Lee 2021
>Everything is good when you go thick Immediate childishness ensues.
how is MS excel performing on these? I am currently on a 2018 MBP and I'm not super happy with the performance and considering an upgrade.... worth it or does MS Excel not work well on the M1?
Can we game (fortnite) on it for extended period of time?
There are multiple cameras in that notch. One of them is a sensor which takes heat images of you every few seconds.
What? 40?????? You must be kidding!!! 🤡🤡🤡
Ooooooh two stickers for three grand. Bargain.
bro i'm 23 and look older than you ppl call me grandpa why ur face look like oppa
Most honest review that i've seen!
14” doesn’t come with M1 Max, does it?
1:17 amen brother
Always the most honest review. That's what always brought me here and still brings me here.
"Everything is good when you thick"
No face ID? Probably chip shortage.
Tools, that's all they are. 100%, beautiful sexy looking tools :p
This guy is 40? Damn your job doesn’t allow you to age.
Dave spreading the love for Kurzgesagt videos :)
Love the last bit about the purpose of these and who they’re right for.   Thanks Dave, informative as always! Hope you’re well!
That notch doesn't need to be crazy big for a 1080p webcam. You can't justify this shit dave. Common. A hole punch would have been way better since they haven't included face id. Ugliest MacBooks ever. There are better windows laptops which are powerful yet elegant. Sorry apple. But the design sucks
Dave's 40?!!!!. Oh wow. He's so young looking. I thought he is in his late 20s.
Everything is better when you go THIKK I agree
wow Dave! can't believe you're 40! thought you're in your mid 20s or something! good for you mate
İts a bulky fucking laptop. TERRİBLE design! i dont mind the notch.. The best design is the m1 macbook pros
Dave : "They are really cool but they are tools. That's all they are." Thanks Dave for these wise words ❤️
"Everything is good when you go thick." Most true statement I ever heard in my life. A man of culture.
I love the ending thanks Dave!! Allocate your money to something else guys, new and expensive tech like this will get better and better just think if you really need this device or are you just buying it to show off and etc
They're really cool. They are tools. skr
Dave thx for info about M1 Max MBP. gfxbench 5.0 high tier 308fps awesome! my rtx3090 is just 218fps(on the 4k dx12).
Personally, as a Apple m1 Macbook Air user I'm glad I didn't buy this. Totally not worth the money. The notch, the thickness, and price tag are huge step backwards.
You're 40???   This man looks 25 to me 😂
40! THIS WHOLE TIME I THOUGHT THIS GUY WAS AT LEAST 33
Thanks for your Test! But u forget that you testet premiere optimized for x86 Processor and not optimized for ARM ;) Plz test also with optimized Tools for ARM Architecture.
Everything's good when you go THICC 😏
But how many chunks could I load on Minecraft?
I just can't get over the fact that Apple made a thic laptop
Wait I thought Dave was 29, how is he 40 ?
And this exact video is why even though we have 1000 techtubers, I still rely on Dave. No fluff, no BS, no upsells. Str8 Fax
Grandpa talks at 120fps
"Everything's good when you go thicc" ~ Dave2D
You know ur 28 Dave
4:22 Nice impression of a old man
The new MacBook pro, Performance : pro Battery : pro Build quality : pro Price : BRUH
One of your best videos.
Dave really appreciate your reviews - really great. Thank you very much.
Came here to be blown away by the new MacBook Pro. Left here blown away that you are 40.
"I'm 40 right"..... HOLY SHIT
They are really cool, but they are tools.
If M1 Macbooks get proper bootcamp support and if Apple ever decides to price these laptops sensibly, then they could easily disrupt the gaming laptop market.
ive got sooo many apple stickers. Havent used one
Not the MBP benchmarks but that age is more shocking. Seriously 40
I am 25 and  Dave looks younger then me 🥲
Great review man I'll stay with my g14 then
I wish they refreshed the 13" inch, as a web dev i dont need this much power, but the port selection and the extra ram...  :'(. Dunno what to do...
"Everything's good when you go thicc" -Dave2D
@Dave2D please what laptop do you thing is the widow’s equivalent of the new m1 macbooks😭
What's up port (HDMI) plugg it up lol. Dave is lowkey comical.
Can you show Apps with lots on menus, like PyCharm? We want to see that the notch doesn't get in the way.
no center stage, no Face ID :((((( almost pro
"Everything's good when you go thicc." (Inside my head, in Borat voice: "High fiveh!")
Anyone buy Apple products for Their Stickers?!
Seriously you were hyped about the stickers?
I would prefered a wider upper bevel than a that notch
You're *FOURTY*!? No freakin' way. You look like you're in your 20s WTFH!?
Damn ....I thought that u were around 25
giveaaway
Wow. 40.
Great review!  And also damn I would guess you're like 29 lol
Fuck the 20 cent stickers, only brain dead people would be excited about it... Oh wait apple users
I love how you tell us that if we don't have a pressing need for a professional grade tool that we shouldn't pick it up. I'm on the hunt for a new laptop and the 14in mbp was top of my list, but I already have a desktop that can crush all sorts of heavy workloads. Maybe I'll get a macbook air or look towards getting an xps. Great video though!
Macbook air M1 here I go!
i watched the entire video and loved it, but the only thing i took away was nothing related to apple, but that dave's 40!
Great video, loved the finish line.
Wait you get a charger?
Why not give it the latest HDMI since it's a 'pro' machine and apple likes to talk about HDR, High resolution displays and 120hz in their marketing? It makes no sense. Apple are normally the first to get rid of 'out dated' ports. Also why does it need to be thick and heavy if apples new chips are so thermally efficient?
Loved the way you ended the video !
Hey great review, still wondering how it compares to a Dell work station with 3D rendering software like AutoCAD or Rhino 3D or even 3D Studio Max running on an emulator via Big Sur🤔🤔🤔!
YOU'RE 40 WTF
The fact that this thing can even get close to 120 fps running Parallels is bonkers to me. I'd love to see a whole video on the topic if that's possible, just to see how good of a Windows laptop this macbook can get
i like how he made a nice conclusion at the end. its tempting, but i dont need it.
You're 40?????? NO WAY! Like, srsly!
Hi Dave! What color you would recommend for that 16”? Looks like most of the unboxing video for this 16” is white
Dave you the man! "Tools is what they are"! You are the YouTube laptop reviewer King!
Wait, what? you are 40?????? men, I was thinking you was on your late 20's!!!
5:08 Dave watches NF?? Nice
These are definitely only for people who have a use for the immense graphical capabilities of this chip. As a software engineer and software producer I believe I'll be doing just fine with the regular M1 for a few years, and it's also what I'd recommend for most people.
M1 is a Revolution.
I love that you're the only reviewer out there that still cares about overwatch. This makes you the best reviewer.
Notch is because they will add face id next model
"They're tools. Thats all they are." -Dave2D talking about Apple
I disagree about the "they are tools, so you don't need it".  This is the most exciting redesign of the Macbook pro since 2008 in my opinion, and I will be buying the top model and loving and using the shit out of it for at least 3 years. Haters gonna hate, but I like to buy the top model and then ride with it, trust me, while the Pro might seem good enough now, the Max will ensure you have a rocking laptop for a few years to come. When you consider the RAM uprgrade cost, what's a couple hundred bucks more for the better processor when you're already at like $3500? Seems like a no-brainer.
might stick to my 2019 macbook air for a while and just get the m1 macbook pro (I think I am the only person who likes the touchbar)
This things look so industrial yet so elegant I love them! That power too! Just something else, RIP Intel
I have never paused a video to comment my shock. You're 40??!!
"Everything is good when you go thicc" I see Dave is a man of culture as well
Thank you for the honest advice. I’m guessing that 2020 13 inch macbook should be sufficient for a 3D app user (like Revit or AutoCad?
WTF Dave is 40? you look goooooooood
4:50 R.I.P BOZO 💀💀💀
That message at the Dave, thanks for taking care of my finace desitions. I really don't need that laptop, I already have 2 windows laptops (high performance) and one desktop (high performance).
Dave can you atleast bug razer to build a Razerbook 14 with 16:10 4K Oled Display, i9 12900HK,  64GB of ram and an RTX 5000 gpu.
yo dave really waiting for that pixel vid 👍
"everything's good when you go thick" - Dave2D, 2021
40!! No damn way dave
Say what you want, but they should have just put black bar across the screen, the notch looks bad, it looks bad on iphones (starting from X model) and it looks bad on macbook. Even their marketing department knows that, that's why they try to hide it in their promotion photos/videos.
I can see the internal power is amazing, but I am sorry to say this. The design is horrible. It looks like an HP gray laptop. By far, one the ugliest models Apple has ever made. The previous MacBook Pro design was 100% stylish and minimalist. I think this is something everybody knows, yet nobody wants to emphasize. Let's try to be objective. Apple is far away from its standards in terms of its usual designs...
Notches and hole punches are hideous. Bring back the bezels!
You're 40?! You look more like 14! Anyway, I've never owned a Mac and wouldn't know how to use one, but I had to watch this video because you can make anything sound intriguing.
Was kinda sad when I saw all of the awesome improvements over last year’s model, which I own. The ending of this video honestly soothed my soul, thanks Dave <3
I can't believe he's 40 😂
I have to pause here at 4:21.YO brO wait a second.YOU say whattt??? Ya 40 years old?????How the heck you looks way younger than me.I am 29 and I am Asian too ……..lmfao
Dave : "...I'm 40 right so..." Me : Pauses video, hands in my head, "WHAT?", clicks play.
wait, Dave is 40? I thought he is like 22.
HE'S FOURTY??? 🥵🥵
So unless the program is completely rewritten to optimize for ARM then the windows laptops are still faster. This should get more talk people to talk like these are the fastest things every but that only on super good apple apps. And unlike the old mac's where you could boot into windows and get perfect gaming you can't with these.
*WASTED AN ENTIRE MINUTE TALKING ABOUT SHITTY STICKERS!* 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
not me looking for a ring on his fingers after Dave saying he's 40. 🤭
Hello! Great video, Much appreciated. I do have a question. You mentioned you're a Premiere Pro user and it sounded like you use a windows pc for that. May I ask what kind of PC that is?
Dude you look like 25 atmost. How the hell has your aging stopped. Youre the real alex costa dude
There tools that’s all they are. Definitely a great quote.
CHONKERS
He's already 40 but looks like early 30's  Me now at 30: looks like already on the 50's ☠️
Americans think Asian people age slowly. Well the truth is, the rest of the world don't eat as much junk food and meat products as Americans do. White people in Europe look younger on average than white people in America.
You Dave are absolutely awesome
I don't think people realize even the base model 14", probably 80% if buyers won't even use the amount of power that chip has
The Big Reveal - Dave is 40 😉
Parallels? Overwatch? Help me out here, what is he talking about?
I'm buzzing because I never seen Dave so excited about apple thicc boi stuff. Love it!!
you look 27
Am i the only one thinking Dave is a bit too fast paced in this video maybe as excited us we do? Love his gaming approach.im stuck in a dilemma, only thing i use MacBook is for Final Cut Pro and it is just for my channel nothing commercial.but maybe I should get a gaming laptop either rtx 3070 or and rx 6800 and switch to adobe premier pro? I’m an old gamer as well and not sure actually to spend too much on new MacBook pro.. 🤔
THANK YOU for including that gaming benchmark. I spent way too much time wondering how well this thing would perform in games, since games were the only reason I haven't switched to Mac yet.
love ur videos dave
the sheepish confession of watching the bts concert with your family is so sweet haha i wish my family would watch with me
Just 8 minutes long??? Very information packed! Learned a lot.
Most important quote: "They are really cool but they are tools. That's all they are."
thanks for the realistic point near the end of your video dave. I know I poke fun at you all the time in my comments (not that you read them) but I do appreciate when you add your realistic comments in there. I've been trying to replace my Surface Book 2 15" with something more like the new 14" machines from Apple, but I think perhaps the 13" Air might be good enough for me.
god these laptops are beautiful. near perfect. i love the thickness but it seems uncomfortable to type on. my current mbp sIits my wr!st
See I have no wife or kids and a paid up mortgage so I need to console my “grief” with tech lol
Damn Dave! You look good for 40... I had no idea.
I thought you were deadass 25!
The notch is ugly, I would prefer the xps screen design no matter how bad the camera quality is. All they needed to do is to return all the missing ports to the previous macbooks that's it. At least they abandoned that touch bar. And why is it so thick it's like my old 17" 2011 macbook, does it have CD bay - no, does it have an express card, no, probably RJ-45 - wrong. Any non-soldered replaceable SSD - no again, maybe battery check button - hmm, not even close? So why? According to the presentation M1x and m1max are much more efficient and cooler than x86, so what's the point, you didn't add usb-a ports neither HDMI 2.1 (to support 120Hz). So you just make it thick and heavy because it's for pros...? then please make ipad 12" pro thick and return 3.5 jack to it... ah? professionals do not use wired headphones...? Or you just want us to buy all models you have just for different situations: for trips (macbook air), for work (macbook pro), for pleasure (ipads pro) and just case iphones :) And don't forget imacs for the kitchen...
OK, Dave give it up. You're still in your late 20's!
Screw the review, I didn’t know you were 40!?!
1:10 that kind of thicc should be flagged for inappropriate content.
Love the fact that Dave is listening to NF The Search! P.s. You're kidding when you say you're 40 right? Right?
God I wish I could afford a macbook cause I really need a laptop for university 😔
👍👍
1:17 THATS WHAT SHE SAID
For some reason I expected Dave to be more excited/enthusiastic in this review but it was just his usual energy
Dang I thought you were in your 20s...
I wonder how much faster when it compare to the desktop Mac Pro? The basic configuration? And the top configuration?
I'm waiting for the new macbook air to come out. I don't need a super powerful laptop cause I already have my desktop workstation at home. Really cool laptops though!
I’m glad you mentioned that last part. The tech nerd in me really wanted the latest and greatest here - but the truth is my near-base M1 Macbook Pro is already handling my professional editing workflow just fine. If we were doing 6K or raw or something, it would probably be worth the upgrade, but it handles 4K H.264 beautifully and the battery life is fantastic. I’ll be keeping my M1 MBP until something new comes out - maybe a new Macbook Air with an M2 somewhere between the M1 and M1 Pro.
Thanks for the advice at the end of the video. That's exactly what I kept asking myself: do I need this? I think I will stick to an M1 MBP or an M1 MBAir, they seem to have everything I really need in terms of performance and well, they cost a whole lot less. I'm a 10+ years windows user, but the ARM is really a selling point.
everythings better when you go thicc
This look so much like 2006 Macbook Pros! A W E S O M E!
"Everything is good when you go thicc"  -D2D 2021
Why not an apple?
Dave is not in his 40s.
Finally HDMI, better 15 years late than never
Brutally honest Ending Mate... "There are just tools". I was really confused on this purchase
Dave: yes I use premiere Premiere: 6:58
WAIT A MINUTE. DAVE IS 40 YEARS OLD?!!!!
Phew I was worried but these arent as inasane as I thought they would be.
Okay, some real questions now - Dave, what do you do to look (and feel probably) this good, young and energetic in your 40?😮
It's a bit annoying that Apple is getting a pass on putting a notch like that on a laptop when we all no not a single other manufacturer would get the pass. It's 2021, if you're going to do that, you gotta at least put face unlock into it.
Dave: There are just tools. Me: Checking out a $6000 laptop because I want shiny...
Great video Dave, these are the specs and info I needed. Wondering if you could do a follow up video with a bit more of a deeper dive into the GPU performance of the M1 Max in Redshift and Octane Render, as well as playback and export speeds in the new DaVinci Resolve - particularly Red RAW and Blackmagic's claims that the new Resolve performs 5x faster on these new Macbooks.
Only if douchebags at apple bring steam and gaming to mac.
Woot! I won the guessing game on how the mouse would behave with the notch! I feel satiated.
4:20 Wait what!
No way this man is 40! I thought he is 20 something
"everything's good when you go thick" ~ Dave
M1 Macbook Air is still the best laptop in the market...
"EVERYTHING GOES GOOD WHEN YOU THICC"
The ending hit the sweet spot in my heart...
I’ve been waiting for this since my MacBook Pro 2015 😂
Thanks, great review.  Only feedback would be re: the use of GFXbench and even Geekbench.  Totally irrelevant benchmarks which may give a really false impression re:  M1max and M1Pro performance in gaming compared to decent tdp laptop RTX 3070 and 3080s (appreciate the Macs aren't gaming laptops).  As you can see from a real game benchmark (Shadow of the Tomb Raider), the Macs are around the level of a low tdp laptop RTX 3060 at best.  I'd like to see some creator benchmarks which make full use of the M1Max memory bandwidth
7:42 250 Nits ? with this brightness you can see hardly anything or?
eSIM would be an awesome add-on.
The designer of the MacBook pro should be punched in the throat for that notch design.
I think my biggest take away from this video is that you're 40!
I want to see gaming tests
1:17 That’s what she said
But  does it edit with no lags with gopro footages?😅
Everything is good when you go thick !! , yeah sure
Dave is just so straight to point! <3
Is this a BIG THICK BOY too?
This is what happens when Jony Ives leaves the company... ugly af design
Comparing the M1 to Intel processors when we all know AMD blows them out the water
You get black apple sticker. Lol... Framework is what people should buy, instead of this glued, anti-consumer piece of shit.
40 years old!  Ancient!  But still the BEST reviews.
"Their tools. That’s it”. Awesome comment!
Excellent video with a drop of wisdom. Classy, informative, overall healthy honest review. Keep it up!
Dave = Straight to the point 🔥
That reality check in the end. That’s what sets you apart from everybody else Dave!! Cheers!
to much money  i rather spend the money on a car
Comparing the Max to a 3080 is laughable
Everything is good when you go thick - That's what she said
Loved to hear that your family is also ARMY 💜
40? like😲
oh look they  noticed that nobody gives a fuck about thin laptops
great and honest review and thanks for no boring us for stupid la la la editing
Still, a notch is not my cup of tea...
I really loved you said that - "if you don't need it. Don't buy it"
people here pretend like 40 is old. take care of yourselves people.
Wait, what? You’re 40? Hell no.
Are we going to ignore the new table
That last statement tho: "They are really cool, but they're tools" - Dave2D (2021) on Macbook Pro 2021 16" and 14"
Good
Can you please test if the new macbook pros support usb c 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20Gbps) in order to benefit from the new SanDisk ExtremPro external SSDs with 2000 mb/sec.
Unlike other tech reviewers Dave is the first tech reviewer to say you don’t need these MacBook Pros because they’re tools.
Im getting the macbook pro just for the black sticker !!
Dave is 40 yrs old srsly?🙂🙂🙂🙂
The first thing pumped into my eyes are not the Macbooks, but you teal PC case :)))
"Everythings good when you go thick" - Dave
there's no way he's 40
Grandpa voice ftw!
So what are you using today for rendering, AE etc?
The best part of this videos is the subjective disclaimer about whether it's a must buy or you will live staying away from it.
U 40 years old bro???? Damnnnnnnn
So, dave said i don't need to buy i am not gonna buy🙂.      **Crying in the corner because i don't have money either.
Nice game Dave 👍🏼😁
5:19 "my family was watching the BTS concert"  dave : visible discomfort  lmao 😂 😂
Dave could you make a vid about good/bad things about this 2 new macs. Of course not right now but I’m a few weeks from now. I would like to see something like that.
Weird review. It is more like unboxing. Nothing is said that HDMI is not needed with thunderbold to hdmi adapters. Previously It can be used on both sides and now you are limited. With such thickness why no USB type-A port? Is it needed for users - yes. It cannot be implemented previously, but can now
I watched the introduction to this video and started thinking:"can i play Minecraft on these laptops"...hmmm
These will sell to those rich people who only use them to watch youtube vids in starbucks.
100 fps in training mode in shitty game? LOL
I'll be honest Dave, this was a very lame and lazy review for such a machine. There are no proper comparisons with the M1 mac pro, or any other competitive Windows laptop barring the one Premiere use case. And considering the prices we are paying, I do not see any reason to omit HDMI 2.1. On one end you say these are tools meant for pros, not meant for fun purchases. On the other, you say the HDMI is meant for a quick connection, not for high quality displays. There are so many other things, but honestly, I am just sad. Deeply sad for one of my favorite channels whose reviews made me purchase my laptop all those years ago.
Ridiculously honest review. You are the bomb, son. Thank you for helping me to save £1900. Keep it up!!!!!
Dave in sage mode, "they are really cool, but they are tools". Awesome 😁
I keep seeing people acting like these devices aren't an improvement because they're backtracking. I get lack of ports and touchbar are issues they created, but they solved them now and made improvements in performance and the screen as well all while having top of the line battery life. I'm impressed. Not crazy about the notch for just a webcam. Add faceID and i'll be happy. Not a big deal either way though.
Love your responsible take on tech Dave.... Agreed, we should really not buy things we don't need, and generally most people have more than they need...   Yesterday I re-installed windows on my brothers "free dumpster PC" (upgraded with a core2quad Q9400, SSD and a GTX750Ti) and I realized how much of a full desktop experience it actually still offers is even if the platform is from 2006 (!!!). I mean, it could actually still play modern games at a respectable "console experience (1080p30fps). It lacks AVX instructions and some games required patching. but I ran Witcher 3 (Red Engine), Ghost Runner (Unreal 4), Prey (Cryengine), Snake Pass (Unreal 4) etc. without hiccups. If I didn't have anything else, I would still be fine with such a PC experience. (except during video editing). It's easy to get sold that we need to upgrade everytime there's a new shiny thing. But honestly, desktop computing has been fine for a VERY long time. and laptops have been quite good for a couple of years :)
You're 40!!???
Even for an asian, it's incredible how much your age doesn't show
🍏💙
Hi Dave, this is Apple, we wanted to say great review and also, we are a little pissed off because two things happened. 1. Everyone canceled their M1 Max orders and re-ordered the 16 32GB 24 cores with 1TB storage and 2. Anyone dating skinny women, dropped them for a women with a phat ass. We only agree with number 2 in this review...
Nice
Waiting on your pixel 6 review before ordering it.
I didn't know Dave is 40 until today 😳, he looks so youngg 🥺
See this is where I get confused. I just watched multiple other videos showing huge improvements specifically running Adobe Premiere. I’m talking 4-5x improvements. Then I watch this saying it’s not a big difference in Adobe premiere. So what’s what? Maybe he’s not using the Adobe Premiere version optimized for M1?
Linus looks older than Dave! LOL
Does it get 1000 nits on non-hdr content? like when writing code in xcode outside?
"There's no way that Apple, in 2021, would put a web cam of that kind of resolution into their pro device."  I agree with you that a premium, pro device should have a better built-in camera than what the XPS has, but I really don't think that Apple makes it enough of a priority for it to be a foregone conclusion. My $3K+ 2019 16" Macbook Pro has a 720p webcam that I will never not be horribly disappointed in.   Outstanding video as always, Dave. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
1:18 tell em again Dave
"everything is good when you go thicc" hahaha... no cap!!!
Always giving the best advise
I thought about looking at new pro. But since i am using this as recreational and some video editing i went with macbook air. I didnt see the extra $1000 worth it for me.
The notch in principle is a sign they have truly lost their way. Read iPhone forums. What were they thinking? And get rid of the rounded corners already! It looks like a child’s game. Professional everything is squared corners. As for function over form, that has never ever been Apples motto. Steve Jobs will haunt you for that comment. Thick and heavy for performance? Get an iMac! I have to stick these things in a backpack with other equipment.
a macbook pro that doesn't overheat immediately? ... i want to believe it, but i've been burnt by apple too many times.
Hu, 40? sheesh... wait until 50 and you have your reading glasses.
Also waiting the video of MKBH
I love Apple
Is the performance drop when on battery ? Like all gaming laptop all performance drop when not on charge could you tell me ? Big thank sub
Dave is 40? The fuck.
Geat, thanks for making everything clear to us wish you all the best bro
2:13 Face ID isn’t not on there because you need to activate it on purchases. On a iPhone or iPad you have to double press the power button. If you have to do that one a Mac you will have to press something on the keyboard. In that case you might as well have Touch ID
Alright @Dave2D , I see you with the hanzo!! Seriously thanks for including that part, I am also curious about gaming performance 😁
Which gaming laptop would you suggest to buy? I have my eyes on Msi GE76 and Alienware x17. Any other suggestion? Which one would you suggest to take between those 2?
@Dave …..Loved your closing remarks !!
This thing is just rediculus expencive here in Denmark.   17499 kroner or 2730 dollars for the: (MacBook Pro 2021 M1 Pro 14.2" 8CPU/14GPU/512GB SG)  I think I'll go back to a windows computer at this point.
I still wonder why it has 4 cameras facing down filming the desktop. Any fancy high-res move detection maybe?
Haven't been excited for a macbook in 5 years, well done Apple
Wait... You're actually 40? I wouldn't give you more than 30 🤨
Can you discuss the new Windows 11 interface?
I love the reality check at the end, Dave. "They are just tools". Was glad to hear that mentioned.
WHAT, is parallels performance that good for gaming, what the hell
Hate to say it but..the design looks kinda ugly. Guess they figured couldn’t compete with xps on that front..& no hdmi 2.1 for “expensive” laptop.
u 40? Wtf u look like 30
40?!?!?!?!?!
This is the review I've been waiting for. Actual benchmarks! Thank you for showing us the new MacBooks, and not getting all caught up in the new product hype.
they are really cool... but they are tools. Sums up the review for me and I shall pass
Jesus Christ he don’t look 40 years old
I rarely use the function keys. Only for brightness really. I will miss the touch bar.
“Everything’s good when you go thicckkkkk” Amen to that
F*ck are you 40? I thought you were like in your 20s
Can we play games like Tekken 7 or Street fighter or GTA on these pro machines? How would the performance be for games!!???
Wow! Those look heavy
finally an honest review!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I gave him 33-35. I look young for my age, too, so I'm surprised that he's 40, but not shocked.
/* laughs in PC */
how do yopu play overwatch on a macbook ? i thout there was no mac version of the game ? or its on a virtual machine with windows ? i dont understand....
@2:05 NO! they didn’t put notch because of the good webCam but it is introduced because of in 2nd iteration it will be removed or put Face ID in it then completely removed just after the iPhone 15 notch less display… honestly speaking they can’t make perfect product… otherwise no one buy products in 3-5 years if something not significantly changed!
I wish i had to money to get one of these lol
DAVE IS 40 ?!?!?!?
Everything's good when you go thick                               - Dave 2021 😂
I am also happy I don't have to buy a MacBook, too much money
everyone complains about the new notch but dude have you really paid attention to that ugly thickness?
What laptop is Dave’s current daily?
Hi! How m1 pro and m1 max in games like dota 2? Cyberpunk 2077?)))))
it always amazes me that you've mastered the one-take video, great content as always!
COULD YOU CHARGE THE MACBOOK PRO WITH THE TYPE C AND MAGSAFE PORT AT THE SAME TIME?
“I’m 40” excuse me wtf. This man looks  20 AT MOST
This 20 yo looking man is 40? Wtf do you eat? 🙄
Finally! A real review!
hey dave, could you review some machenike laptop. its cheap but powerful.
Show us that notch with an Excel worksheet - does it cover any cell?
this was the best review of this product I have seen so far
*_Power brick_*_ included?_ 🤔
dude, you 40??! no no no, you 20.
Coolest review I ever watch, but u seem to omit the 14".
are really that long?
Wait, this is an ARM machine right? You can just run Windows via Parallels and play Overwatch on it? Is there an ARM version of Overwatch?
Dave is 4D
I didn't expect that Dave is 40 yo !!! He looks like 20
DAVE IS 40?!!!!!!! WHATTTTT?!!!!!!
I do think the touchbar removal was not the best idea❗️ They could’ve given a chance by moving it to the area between screen and keyboard with the function keys back‼️ That thing’s potential has not been achieved yet❗️
Thiccness is goodness, Yaasss!
The review is a little apple fan boyish for me. How does the magsafe get a pass when the same review for surface laptop 4 gets the surface connector trashed for not just charging via usb c and to be fair, every proprietary charger gets mentioned "why not charge via USB C.  Apple goes back to the magsafe and all of a sudden its cool.
Last line : They are really cool but they are tools, That's all they are 👌
Thanks Dave! Really, thank you.
Wth how is Dave 40?
“Everything’s good when you go thick” 1:17
DAVE IS 40??
Wait he's 40!!!!!!
Spend 4k on a laptop you get different colored stickers? Damn Apple, you guys really know how to appreciate your customers. *NOT*
Hmmm... I don't know if it's because you didn't focus on benchmarking - as is your style - but my takeaway from your review is that Apple's hardware is becoming too good for their own good. These are solutions looking for problems. I hope more software gets optimized for them soon. For gaming, the 3060 comparison seems legit, but I'll look for benchmarks specific to the games I play for more comparisons.    Also, goddamn I'm getting sick of YouTube comments. Instead of useful discussion everyone's either jerking off the YouTuber or just repeating the jokes.
Are you going to cover the surface laptop studio in a full review?
wait what?? 40??
Everything is good when you go thicc -dave
Dave reviewing Macbooks, people in the comments reviewing if Dave is actually 40. Lol
You're 40? You look so good for your age
I think these new MacBooks look even better than the old ones
That one advice in the last of this video, thanks for that. Appreciated. ✌🏻
I have to buy a MBP now not because I need it, but because it's that great.
Nice review ! Any plans to compare with the Laptop Surface Studio ? :)
"They are really cool, but they are just tools"  The best wisdom/philosophy i have heard on youtube for a long time
Wtf dave is 40? He looks like 21
They are really cool but they are tool
8:23 wow, that sets me back to reality. Was considering getting this but not anymore
Honest as fuck abt the tools and expensive part. Appreciate it bro.
Excellent as always!
The notch is simple. Future proofing for Face ID and better cameras and sensors. Why is everyone making such a big deal about it FFS
Notch
That closing comment was class.  This is my new fave channel.
The MacBook Air is good enough for 99% ppl out there.
YOU'RE FOURTY???!!!!!
i like em thicc too
too thicc
everything is good when you go T H I C C
Thank you for the honesty about Premiere.
it's better when it's thick 😭
I think for next year they will announce a new Mac air with new pros and the air will have a processor has performance either something closer to m1 pro or something between m1 and m1 pro and they call it m2. What you thing?
Did you try the high power mode of macos monterey ? Or is it not available yet
1:35, your welcome!
I can't tell the sticker part is a joke or for real. LOL
Dave2D: I'm 40... Me: Spits out coffee on old MacBook
Thank you for the wise words at the end- trying not to give into the temptation of purchasing one...
Another great video ❤️
Want it for sure. Need it? Not even close :) I would prefer one USB-A instead of the SD-card slot, but apart from that, really nice changes from Apple. I still use a entry level 2016 MBP 13 and the logical switch when I need to do so (probably because of the butterfly keyboard giving up) will be going to an M1 Air. Not as fun and cool, but good enough for most for half the price.
“They’re really cool, but they’re tools. That’s all they are.”  A line never hit harder than this.
@ 2:06 Uh… are we talking about the same company??  Because they been doing it for years!!
There is no way in hell you're 40
Thicc bois
Should've had at least one USB A port.
woah woah woah. 8.5 hours on the 14 inch? is that worse than the m1 air?
XPS look more better
Perfect review. All the infos you need in just 8 minutes. Especially liked the reminder at the ending. These are Pro machines. Your average user will never even tap into the performance of these devices. That's what the M1 is for, it'll even get you better battery performance on the 13".
I always like about Dave's brutal honesty. He is one of the few reviewers that isn't afraid to tell people don't buy a certain good product because of the price.
Man Dave's become so old I don't know if he's sarcastic or not
Real shame about the performance on other software, was hoping for a bigger jump, there does not seem to be that mush different between the M1 and M1 Pro if I am honest, M1 Pro Max seem to be where it's at. Might hold on to my i9 for a little longer and see how this plays out?
With disappointment sais :  "My family was watching the BTS concert..."
Ends on “they’re really expensive tools, these are only for professionals” *after talking about Overwatch running at 120fps. Damnit Dave! (Lol jk, don’t buy MacBooks for games, these chips aren’t even optimized for it)
Does the new MacBook have PWM or not? thanks
8:22 at first i didnt believe hes 40. now i think he is 50.
Who will believe that he is 40 years old
HE IS 40? BRO I THOUGHT HE WAS 20 SOMETHING BRUH
And I must ask what is your current rendering machine?
Dave just dropping some fiscal responsibility in the end.
Everything's good when you go thick. Hmm boy I must agree.
Man, that thiccness isn't really appealing tho (it might be just me idk). One of the reasons why I love macbooks is their thin body and their light weight while packing such power. Unfortunately, this one throws me back to the 2012 macbooks with it's thick design.
You're 40!?!???
There's no way you're 40!!
why compare m1 pro with m1 max, instead of 14" max to 16" max?
I can't believe you are 40 I thought you were around 28
Are the fans the same on 16 and 14’? I am most interested in how noisy they get. Thanks for your reviews.
As a PC user, I was impressed by these laptops.
"Everything good when you go Thicc" lol you got me
What I came for : Banchmarks, pro motion, actual battery life What gave me a smile : Dave grandpa voice
That was review I was kinda hoping for but... - too little about battery - too little about performance in real life apps (not only video)  But Dave. As always great work!!!
Dave, it looks like you tested the base model M1 Pro 14. Did you experience any lag or frame drops in FCPX when editing 4K 10 bit files? Would you recommend that model for the Sony video codecs from the A7SIII. H.265 ALL-I, etc? Would love to know if it performs well in that scenario, or if you think it would be better to spring for a Max config with more GPU and unified memory. Thanks!
You're 40??
40? No way.
UR 40???
Wait.. you're 40!! Dayuumn... (*in Kevin Hart's voice)
crazy that it handles overwatch so well non-native
So we r back to the desk
I was thinking I would be able to upgrade from M1 Mac mini, but that price had me running away...
I can't believe the fact that Dave is 40 years old.  He looks so much younger
Wow.
It kinda looks ugly
Wait a minute. HOLD ON. You're 40?! You don't look a day over 30.
6:44 Wish Dave put Davinci Resolve 17.4 here.
The fff? He’s 40? No way would have believed you if you said 30
Thicker is better…  Michael Scott - “THATS WHAT SHE SAID!!!”
As Dave Said.. They are just tools after all..
Dude you 40, for real??? I thought you were like maybe 28-30, wow!. I need to eat what you eat.
Is it still a good idea to buy a macbook air or pro 2020? I just need a fast laptop with 8h+ battery life that can last me a few years. Thanks!
So how was the concert?
I have one question! If you change the scale to "More Space" in System Preferences, how does it work with that notch?
No shot he's 40
Good review. Thank you. Looking forward to get 16 next year (replacing my 2016 pro with horrible keyboard).  I like your sweat shirt. can you tell me where can I get it.
Wth Dave is 40??? He’s blessed with young genes!
Why did you sound sarcastic the whole time ? 🤣
“Everything’s good when you go thicc” yoooo I hope she heard that !
fuckin windows user spotted
40? Nah 33 max.
Loved the last part on purchase advice. Another great review.
Here the Swiss blade intro is would have look better
"EVERYTHING IS GOOD WHEN YOU GO THICCC"
You are not 40, stop the lies!
black apple stickers? i’m sold
He looks like in his early 30s even as an asian
The last few lines just melt my heart! Dave you understand technology, love you for that. We should always buy what we need and not to show off.
please tell me you tried some actual gaming before i watch!
They are tools.. That's all they are.. Well said....
Dave Dave Dave.... Now hold on a second. 40 ???!! What ?! No way ! Sorry, I mean sir.
Great review ended with the truth about Apple products as  tools for business. Not recreational products to pose in Starbucks with a coffee ☕. Thanks #D2D
Congrats on the world fastest review period.
Today i learned Mrwhoosetheboss is just 26 years old and dave is 40 :-O
This is the first time I've loved Macbook
That final statement from him, made me stop and let it really sink in that Dave is 40 now.... What a wise thing to say.
Currently grinding for that Dave's last words @ 8:22.... Hoping for 1day those words may look negligible.
Hard to swallow pills: you don't need it, it's a tool
that set up at back tho👀
Dave: I am 40. Me who barely 23: dude I look 10 years older than you. lmao
dude, you are 40 years old ?! I thought you are around mid 20s you look amazing, congrats :-)
6:57 what happened here 😅😅
"I love the thiccness"  -Dave, a man of culture, 2021
1:35 thanks for clearing that up, it had gotten a lot of people scratching their heads😂
Everything's good if you go "THICC". I am 100% agree as a man of culture.
Everything is good when you go thick 😉👊🏾
"Everything's good when you go thicc"  - Dave 2021
WHAT???!!!!  40 years old?  He looks 23 to me.
I am surprisingly happy that the M1 Pro is not significantly more powerful than the regular M1. It means that when I end up upgrading my MacBook Air I won’t be missing out on too much. I don’t do media professional work so these new Pros aren’t for me.
“No way that apple in 2021 would put a webcam of that resolution into their pro device”  Isn’t that what they’ve been doing for every year until now though?
You’re FORTY?!
that bezel broke my heart..
youre ...........................................................40 you look 23 if you were a girl you would have died of happiness rn
But are they repairable?
I was so impressed by those Macs until Dave said he was 40 and my attention shifted. He looks 30 max lol
Almost good one, but you are right.. These are tools I do not need.
Personnaly I prefer the touchbar, and I hate the notch and the new design.
That GOOD GOOD!
Everything's good when you go thicc
Wow a 6am upload!
Good video
WTF, YOUR 40!?!!!?! HOWW... i thought you were in your 20s!
what about the macbook air m1 pro or max
I thoughts they said Tuesday review but i guess today
✅✅✅✅
Could you run the Blender benchmarks on these? That would be grand.
Exactly right about the HDMI port, I think it be used most for presentations, hotel TVs, that sort of thing, where HDMI 2.0 will be just fine. 2.1 would be nice, but I doubt it will really be a big deal for most users.
This guy is 40? ….. no way…
No you are not 40!!!
Just wondering if 14in speaker sounds the same as 16in
Thank you for Xcode. There are many people who CARES about Xcode performance, because Xcode on Intel based Mac always was nightmare, like a bad joke. Now we can breath I guess.
Sounded just like Grandpa Marsh ... scrotum head. Very efficient, I think the variable fps is a great thing for work-related laptops, a lot of these don't really need high refresh but do benefit from longer battery life. Laptops for the pro's .. I'm not so not bothered. Enjoy em
How the hell are you 40?  Man this is unfair I am 25 and I look like a grandpa
Wtf Dave is 40 yrs old,but he looks like 30.
Genuinely appreciate the nod at the end to the fact that these are just tools. Way too many people just HAVE to have the latest/greatest. It's not so much about that anymore, most PCs/macs will perform for everything you need to do already. -written from a user running a 5950x and 3090 to primarily play games from 2006.
Dave, hello.. The pixel 6 came out :)
“They’re really cool, but they’re tools…that’s all they are.” Damn, Dave is such a real one 🥲💙
I need! Replacing my 2011 MBP haha  I like Mac OS. Went with 16” for that Big Bright screen real estate
You're 40?!?!?!?!
The way he got ashamed to say he was watching a bts concert with his family☠️☠️☠️ relatable fr
Dude..... You are 40?
@Dave2D 😂 “Everything is good when you go thicc.” —Dave2D, Oct 25, 2021. Good sir, I could not agree with you more.
Dave, I love you. But the amount of excuses you give for Apple product flaws are tiresome.
40 is really old. I remember it very well. March 1989....
Super
Bloom isn’t a problem that’s why you can’t see it. Never had a problem on my iPad
This is the ugliest macbook ever...
holy crap Dave2D is 40?????
"i'm fourty" excuse me ??? You're twenty pls stop lying
40?! You seem 10 years younger!
Hey Dave, as a Premiere Pro user, would you even bother getting the M1 Max for just the extra bit of speed for rendering time? Or would the M1 Pro suffice?
4:22 Dave please don’t ever do this again
Till the moment you said you are 40, i genuinely thought you were in your late 20s.
"Everything is good when you go thick"
The laptops specs are incredible but they really lost the sexiness and luxe feel to it. Jony Ive's departure is strongly felt.
Can’t believe this guy is 40!
Yeah Dave… Your family was watching…
"EVERYTHING'S GOOD WHEN YOU GO THICK"
am I seeing correctly? claimed: 21h, tested: 11h" !
Google pixel?!
I do not understand the need for a quality webcam, you need to shoot films with zoom or something?
Yeah fancy stuff, but can I play aoe2 in there?
40? dude I thought your were in your late 20s,.
You're 40!!!
Whats the name of that typing test?
Did he just say he is 40? Dave, you better not be pulling April fools prank in October. I showed your face to 12 people who all denied you cant be 40. The max came up was 32.
Isn't Tomb Raider still running in Rosetta2? And I believe DaVinci Resolve is showing amazing performance too. It would be nice if Apple sold a 16" M1, call it a MacBook, drop the Pro, and give people a cheaper laptop with a bigger screen than the Air. Maybe next year?
No waayy you are 40!!! Come on…seriously?
Damn Dave listens to NF. Fans wya!?
"Everythings good when you go T H I C C"                                                   - Dave2D
and: no plug-ins work...
I love that ending, because I was really tempted, but for the price and for what I use it for, is overkill, I think that just for fun its not worth it, you buy it if you in fact are going to be using it for what is meant for, you're right, they are tools.
Hear me out but the touch bar could have been better if, the technology and time permits, a customized or macro enabled function keys with customizable display like a tactile touch screen, but it couldn't be implemented right now 'cause it's insane. Just sayin'.
Black Apple Sticker?!?!  MKBHD: Take my money
"They are really cool,  but they are tool"
Apple is FLEXIN HARD with these devices. The real question is to buy this or wait ~ 1 year for next version with all minor kinks worked out. All apple 1st gen devices were evolutionary but not too refined.
They're just tools. But damn, you're 40. Wow
Perfect review. Zero bias towards apple. Great content 👍👍
Wait a sec, you 40 ?  Boooy you gotta review the drug you taking to look that young!
But how does the M1 max with 32 core GPU compare with last gen Intel i9 MBP with 8GB VRAM? Particularly with gaming?  Can you test M1 Max with parallels and i9 with boot camp?
Hey @Dave2D if you were to pick between the two based on screen size alone what would you choose? I know I want the m1 pro but not sure about the screen size.
Great review as always. Appreciate your work bro.
Again a very good detailed review without a click bait or a title “Apple has fucked up again. ” Apple is making tremendous progress, I think, compared to what they’ve been doing in recent years.
4:20 U WAT?????
NF!!!
I really needed to hear that last part. Thank you Dave!
“Everything’s good when you go thick”  a man of culture I see 😏
that part you have to pause the video and comment "YOU'RE 40?????"
I thought Dave is like 30 something!!
I have been watching a few of your videos here and there......but I finally subscribed today.  All because you consistently "keep it real" for folks of the general population (such as myself).  Great video and I look forward to watching more.
Quite chonkier than I expected.
love your last comment: "there're cool....but they're just tools"
The parallels you ran on it, does it support x86/x64 windows? Or were you running an ARM version of windows?
"Thicc"
I believe the reason they dont have face id is that you would not want the computer to unlock by just seeing you when someone may be behind your back or by your side. It is better to be able to decide when to unlock by touching it.
wait how did you get them?? on website it said available from 29th
Dave is 40? Whatt?
40!
Matters less but the design of this externally is terrible. Block / brick life for 2-3k
Pro stuff 😅
Buen video 👌✌️😎
Ain't he 14 😳...  TF.
BTS CONCERT !!
wow you are 40... you look 30
Like your last line...Need Vs Necessity....:)
"They're tools, that's all they are."  Perfect Ending Dave NGL. Love ya.
how'd you get them so fast
Question is if i NEED it. Im starting at Uni next year and might end up in Physic or IT so larger analytic programs is what ill have to write but idk really know. I know they are just tools though. Question is if the desire for mobile gaming is worth it if I already have a gaming laptop (I cant use it on the go, oh no no) and that might be possible since CrossOver announced a new big update and I think DX12 support might be coming. Cheapest variant worth it considering the better display, ports, etc ? 512Gb SSD would be enough and you don't need any adapter (except USB maybe but I have those but not ANY OTHERS). Difference to 13'' with 1TB is 200€. When I pick this laptop up next year during the back-to-school sale its fro the 13'' price with 1Tb and 16GB RAM. Is it worth it THEN ?
Isnt the notch present to protect the display while lifting the screen?
The honesty in the verdict for purchase at the end, love it. Good stuff Dave!
There's a weird green screen when you showed the store on 6:57
What is up with this review?  It's more like a first impression or preview and too skimpy on details.  For example, I would like to see what's your test video rendering/editing perfromance, so that I can see what kind of test you ran.  You spent more time making fun of stickers than on the video editing performance test, which I'm guessing what many are thinking of using this machine for.
Dude you are 40?
wait you're 40? whaaaaaaaaaaaat I would have guessed 25 or 30 max.
Are the distance between the usb-c ports the same as previous models? Will all of the dongles that came with 2 usb-c ports connected to the site of the macbook still work on these?
w8，you are 40?????? is that a joke or........
Im going to be going into motion graphics and 3D graphics for my degree next year, how would the base 14 inch do with that? Would appriciate feedback!
5:42 "It's not there to connect it to the best screens"  Why? I thought it's pro, so much pro, that we even get black stickers. Quit making excuses on Apple's behalf.
Dave2D IS 40?????? Wtf
The most jaw-dropping part about this video was learning Dave is 40 years old.
Dave is 40!!! wahhh
i can't believe youre 40!
It’s good to see some honest in a reviewer. Others reviewers make you think you are going to get a desktop class 3080 performance with this new MBP but in reality you get a little more of a 3060 laptop chip and close to a 3080 laptop chip only using apple tools.
Am I getting old or the benchmarks are there for a split of a second?
yo, Dave, don't lie about your age lol
"Everything is better when you go thick" Copy Sir :D
Hi Dave.  I must be connected to the internet via Ethernet and wondering if that’s possible with the MBP via the powerbrick?  If not I’ll probably get the MINI for now.
Well... Hackintosh it is!
Pretty happy with my Razer Blade 14 3080
me watching this after picking it up for a fun purchase 😅
Yup the point is they are expensive  I can build 3080 ti,threadripper,128gb ram,8tb storage at a well low price and also buy mac mini fully speced and still will be left saving a lot of money  Though i lose portability and efficiency 'a big factor indeed'
The most balanced review so far
This guy is 40??
5:57 Benchmarks
40?
dave on normal dayes : apple isn't that good go for other options dave after apple event : apple is the best buy it
Did you borrow it from ijustine?
It looks like the old MacBook, the curve and the thickness.. but it doesn't matter if the performance is much better, than the thinner but less features..
You threw everything at this thing but the Kitchen sink, left no stone unturned, this Mac is a Beast!!
you are 40?
You are 40???!!!!
Dave is 40?! Wuttttt
never understood why companies removed the hdmi socket. Its one of the most useful connection for a laptop
HE'S 40????? WTF???
Based on the benchmarks regular M1 is more than good enough for years to come. I just wish it had a 720p camera lol
great PC review... knowing most of your fans are Windows fanboys, good job making sure they know you don't like Apple... anymore... lol
Can this play dota 2though without cooking up for prolonged session? M just curious, plz test it cuz if it does m sold
The only good review, that didnt just cover the top of the line M1 Max like every other channel! I think I'll be hanging on to my 13" M1 MBP and even more happy with that purchase. For general and power users I think the 13" is great value!
Dave's last lines saved me from getting into debt. Damn! Thanks man.
Biggest shock of this video: Dave is 40?! I didn't look that young when I was 25!
“Everything’s good when you go thick” yes yes it is
Dave pulling up from 40 with your shorty
this is why i love dave's reviews. another good one man!
The notch is to set expectations when they figure how to fit out FaceID sensors. It would be awkward to have a bigger chin later and claim its a fresher design . My 2 cents.
We complain it doesn't have 2.1 because it's 2021 and a new product and *should* have 2.1
30"
“Before you have to get the dongle, people would be panicking, the world would be on fire!” Best and accurate description for apple removing the ports 😂
Wait what you're 40?
Yoo u 40? bro i thought u were a high school kid🤣
Will there be a mac mini 2021?
Wait wtf dave is 40 !!!
1:16 _“Everything is good when you go thick.“_  Dave, you know ball.  (Also, you're forty?!)
I always enjoy Dave's honest comments. If you don't need it don't buy it. Thanks Dave.
Every single morning once Dave brush his teeth you can hear the Duke's voice "Damn, I'm looking good" from a bathroom :)
Did this man just say he's fucking 40?! Damn, you could tell me you were 10 years younger than that and I'd believe you.
Those last few lines hit me hard, all I do is web browse emails these days so I do not need these. Hoping to pick up game dev as a hobby but this is overkill for me, thank you for hitting me with some sense Dave. (typing this on my overkill 16inch macbook i9).
40yrs old? Dave what water are you drinking?
Every time Dave mention his age I got shocked a bit
Absolute loved grandpa Dave
BTS concert hahahahha! It is so weird to hear that from Dave 🤣
I would love to see 14" M1 PRO  against Asus g14 and Razer blade 14
40?????
Man I wish I look as young as you when I turn 40
Dave literally looks half his age
I don't know what shocked me more... you saying you're 40 years old or you saying you were watching a BTS concert, haha. One because you really don't look it, and the other because that's just the last thing I expect to hear out of the blue in a laptop review haha
DON’T BUY IT!  *Pre-orders it*
Here's hoping we all look like Dave2D when we're 40.
I would really would love to see a direct comparison with a real PRO Windows laptop like a Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 4 for the same money :D .. You can get a i9(11950H processor)+64gb RAM+RTX 3080 Max-Q with 16GB of memory and a 4K+ display for about 3300 dollars (now in action). . .
"Everything's good when you go thick !"..🤣love it 👍
no WAY Dave is 40
Hey Dave would you do one good entry level gaming pc Build would be nice to see it from you. Love your work .
Like the ending, they're pretty cool, but they're tools
I just want to age like dave...
That's probably the only reason i might get the new macs 5:28
was waiting for this review and got it. Dave always keeps it short and simple. love it.
I love your finishing statement so honest and refreshing - Thanks for that!
It’s so weird not a lot Tech YouTuber buying the M1 Pro Chip everyone wanna buy the Max Chip nice tho😌 but it will nice for YouTubers to do the M1 Pro chip for who wants to get that instead
looks so similar to the old macbooks, i love it
I m disappointed to see the multicore difference between m1 and 8 core m1pro is so little… how on earth the 4 performance core vs 6 performance core boils down to only 10 percent difference…. Should have waited for the m2 macbook air instead
Can't believe he is 40. I feel old already.
At the ending, Dave talked not from a tech enthusiast's perspective but from the perspective of general people, so true
Love to see a Budget laptop buying guide
Black Apple sticker. Off to a good start! Haha
4:20 are you 40 years old Dave ?? i cant believe that !
Dave is cool, that ending🤧🤧🤧why am i crying
Ok, but where can I get that hoodie?
Hard to believe that you're 40. I always thought you were 25 at best.
Forget the macs how are you 40?? No way
That’s really honest review 🙏
For me slight bloom is better than all around grey.
Wait a minute, you're 40????
That last line stealing the show (like if u liked it,subs if u loved it) I did both.
Ya apple is really making tools for pros now.. avg tech enthusiasts like can’t justify the price 😔😔
how are you 40 you look 30 !
I am not surprised about macbook pro features.🧐 I am surprised Dave is 40.😮😯😲 I can't believe.
My 17-inch 2011 MacBook Pro needs a sibling.
What? Dave is 40 years old. What?
I hate to say it but, it's pretty good
How can you play Overwatch on Macbook ???
WAIT. HES 40!?!?!?!??! Bestay you stopped aging wtf
do you think next year they reduce price tag for base versions?
it looks fucking ugly. im an apple fan boy but after this year and the shit they have some out with, so fucking annoying tbh
Your last point say it all. People this are real Pro laptops. Isn't the old PRO apple used to have. Only buy them if you really need the power. The normal person even for edition is fine with Macbook Air or just wait for a possible Macbook Non-pro.
Now, port an AAA game to run in "Apple Silicon" native mode. Yikes.... 😲
"The panel uses retina XDR technology" I threw up a bit when I heard that. "Retina" is not a technology "XDR" is not a technology. They're just marketing terms and by treating them as technical terms and repeating is how we end up getting brainwashed. I am baffled by how many ppl I met have thought "Retina"  is some sort of Apple's proprietary tech. At least, XDR is referring to the HDR nature of the display.
how the f are you 40, I wouldn't give you more than 30
Dave 2021 - Everything is good when you go thick.  Me - Applies to very aspect of life
totally agree with your ending comments, they are just tools after all!
They are cool but they are tools
@Dave2D, I have to say I’m really tempted to by the 16 inch maxed out with 2TB. I’m currently editing R3D footage in Davinci resolve using a 13 inch M1 MacBook Pro and I have to edit in 1/16 resolution, at 1080p or 720p when originally shot in 6K and the moment I slap on dehancer for film grain playback is down to 3-5fps once I start stacking other effects its basically a no go. What are your thoughts with the M1X in this use case. Would I notice a difference or am I just going to be putting a bandaid over a huge gash.
Dave pushing 40 but looks barely 30
And one big point, $2000/$3000 for a machine that is completely unrepairable is crazy. If in 1,5 years your SSD fails u just gotta yourself a very expensive paperweight.
Shout out to the T-rex from Kurzgesagt
Thanks for that last recommendation✌🏼
"Bloom? WHat Bloom I dont see it"😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thick is better? No way. This MacBook iid totally ugly, it looks like that old white MacBook from early 2000s. But everyone is gonna say it’s awesome because… well, it’s apple.
Very measured, mature and calm review. Like a 40 year old.
wait a minute, your hanzo aim is like 🔥🤯
Beautiful machines but as expected is a no match for the performance of Windows devices - it would much rather an Asus G14/15 instead.
1:17 “Everything’s good when you go thicc”…
WHAT HOW ARE YOU 40, I THOUGH YOU WERE LIKE 27-28 OR SOMETHING DAMN
I really like that the headphones jack is on the left side.
Dave2D family BTS concert on the new MacBook Pro 😩
“… there’s no way that apple would put that kind of resolution on their pro devices in 2021”   Ah yes, because in 2018 and onward 720p no-one complained about the resolution. Including MacBook users until that last keynote.  This bare minimum upgrade shouldn’t be worth statements like that, especially when there’s no Face ID in that notch, that’ll be the innovation in a few years. Or at least have made it smaller, there’s so much wasted space behind there if it is just for the camera sensor.  And just to cover my bases. Yes, I have an iPhone, an iPad and am considering buying the new MacBooks. Not an apple hater
Really great, well-balanced review with both data and practical advice! If there was a LOVE instead of thumbs up button, I'd click it. Thanks Dave, look great (because you mentioned your age). 😃
the moment he said "everything's good when you go thick " i instantly scrolled down to see if there were comments regarding this.
What's up with the screen at 1:22? is it a bunch of dead pixels, or is the light bleed that bad?
"They are tools"                            - Dave2D
You know how Hulu doesn't hide your cursor in full screen for some reason? I guess I have a place to hide it now
You're the best. I know that i want that machine yet I don't need it. RESPECT
You are not 40 you look like 28
loved your ending thoughts!
YOU'RE 40?!?!
Thanks for the honesty, Dave. Cooling down our trigger fingers to buy. 🙏
1:17 Everything is good when you go thicccccc 😂
Thank you for that review.  Now I know don’t have to spend all that money on a MacBook.  Thanks for sharing that awesome information .😎👍
Do a gaming test!
“Everything’s good when you go thick” haha. Love this review already.
please compare 16" to lenovo legion5 pro that is speced similar at half the price
I thought Dave was like 28-30, no way he's 40😩
I honestly loved the fact that you just mentioned watching the BTS concert with your fam! 😅😂 I watched mine with my MBA M1 and displayed it on my TV 😊
Did Dave say he’s 40? I always thought you’re 30 😂😂
I get it, They want to sell poison apples.
Jony ive is cringing somewhere
Ok Dave, I thought you might have understood it by now, the Notch is present just for Apple to establish their dominance as a brand. Basically Brand Identity. Not that they don't have it already... Just think of it like a Coca-Cola advertisement. Everybody knows about them, but they still make ads to establish their presence.
Dave before: I don’t like this notch. Dave now: The notch is totally fine!   Apple: Yeah, I’ve paid enough.
You're FORTY? DAMN you aged fine 👀
Wait wait wait wait wait he is 40?!!! 40?!! I'm more surprised on that then the mac books.
I remember some apple fanboys saying the new Mac Book had the same or even performance as top of the line thicker Windows laptops. I guess they think the 3060s Windows laptops are top of the line.
is storage part of the SOC or user replaceable?
4:52 Nice one ! GG
This is my favorite tech channel hands down. How do you manage to make suck concise and comprehensive video while covering everything important in basically one shot is beyond me
wow I'm surprised they're so thick
Finally the Pros are actual pro models that amount to more than a damn battery upgrade
Everything is good when you go thickkkk;)
Everything's good when its Thicc  -Dave2d
1:17 noice
40???? where
He's 40 and immortal 😻
Hold up, Dave is 40? Man he looks like he's in late 20s 😂
Dave you gotta do something about the bots replying on the comments, that thing is legit annoying as we get unwanted notifications and sometimes viewers may avoid commenting.
Deeeem, your videos GLOW! Man i love that theres no background music and you’re talking very clearly, lisaks not too long, perfect!
Awesome review. There’s more clear eyed common-sense in this single video than most Tech reviewers manage in many a month. Pours cold water on both the hype merchants and the detractors alike. You’ve called so many features right - the apparent thickness, the notch, the dynamic 120Hz & brightness that optimises viewing experience vs battery life, the HDMI etc etc. So many people misunderstanding these judgement calls but not Dave2D.  👏🏽👊🏽👍🏽  By the way, I’m over 50 so I had to check with my 16 year old and he thinks you look 30! So no way you’re 40, man! 😆
ah so it performs like a 3060/low wattage 3080 sort of. Thank goodness.
70W 3060 ? That's like the lowest of the lowest. The good ones are like 140w or something like in lenevo legion 5..Not saying the performance is bad but you are trying so hard to make it look better.
It is scary expensive!
they look like Razer laptop, shape wise
I thought you were 27 to 28 years old you look very young, Impressive!
Straight to the point. Great review 👍🏻
4:19 dave is 40 Wtf I thought he might be 32 at the most
You're 40 I thought you were 30
@4:21 is where grandpa Dave kicked in
Wait a seconddd.......... YOUR 40????????????? DAMN
You can tell by his word choices that Dave is now an apple fan boy
I kinda feel like Dave is trolling us saying he's 40
The thing with apple products is although the initial cost is generally higher than the competition, the product will last much longer than other products. I'm running a 2017 MBP and its still running just as well as it did day one 4 years ago, probably wont be needing to upgrade it for at least another 4 years. Best 2.5k I've spent
wtf you're not 40
the shame on his face when he said "my family was watching a bts concert" i died
Dude WTF! You're 40???? Great review by the way, Grandpa.
Dave is 40 but looks like 30... Bruh.. Review your anti aging products
A punch hole could have been placed there
Me:  hears " BTS "  Also me : wait ✋, he KNOWS BTS?!!!   Anyhow this was a really good video. Love your vids.   #btsarmy #heknows?
If it doesn't have HDMI 2.1 for the best screens available, then maybe it's not for real pro? Besides the fact that HDMI 2.0 will not be future proof for them, I guess. At that price, it's ridiculous. But maybe it is a limitation of the M1 architecture... Idk.
Others: With great performance comes great power consumption Apple: Hold my Max Macs
Bad Aesthetics , high price, weight and notch. That's all i see. Proudly own a MacBook Air M1 which is beautiful, functional and worth the money
I can’t wait to buy this in 5 years
his old guy accent was so funny lmfaooooooo 4:22
I’d love to look as young as Dave once I hit 40 🥲
“They are tools. That’s all they are.” I like this reminder because most people out there first buy then start creating a need for the gadget.
Premiere can't take advantage of the new hardware just yet. Really not fair to include it here until it's updated to support M1 Pro/Max's new media encode units.
Dave I gotta thank you very much for that message at the end. I love tech. I’m in school for computer science rn, very much broke, but I kept thinking of pulling the trigger on this laptop cause I love it so much. However you’re right, it’s not a necessity at the moment. So thank you
Yeah now i can open 5 chrome tab at the same time  You know what Apple take my money
Gaming?
Game developers should really start developing macOS versions of their games
All the bravery is gone now :/  Haha those hyprocits still wont admit they were wrong. Pulling the classic coke on us
Am I mistaken or do your comparisons indicate minimal to no real significant differences in performance between the 13" MBP (M1) and the 2021 14"MBP (M1 Pro)?
Are you actually 40????? HOW??  My brother is 22 and looks MUCH OLDER than you.   I don't believe it!
4:19 YOU'RE WHAT!?
Yay to Kurzgesagt piece!))
So, you bought 2 Macbooks?
What ? Thay put that bad camera for almost 11 years..... and it was dezaster. Now thay put that thin..... i dont like it but magsafe is back and one good thing.
Seriously ? you are 40 years old !!!! you look like 20 ! How ?
Throw the 16" junk out the window. But store the 14" is a vault of the highest security.
Why not OLED display
That closing statement is just the right reason for me to not get it.  Unless my macbook air suddenly crashes.
A single usb type A and I could have been sold.
When he said i'm 40 my jaw has dropped
1. Hyping the black sticker 2. "And if you're moving your mouse cursor, it just goes right through it, in case you're wondering" 3. "Everything's good when you go thicc" 4. Bloom? What bloom? I dont see anything in - old person voice  5. How he said how family watching the BTS concert  A lot in a <10min video. You made my day Dave.
My 2014 15" is starting to fail, so I'm happy that they've returned to a similar setup (looking at you, touch bar). I'll wait a few months for Apple to iron out the kinks (and any *gates to happen) - also, that's how long it will take for South Africa to get these ...
"I'm 40" - I thought you were 27
Loved the closing note on purchase decision
No way you're 40
Honestly really tempted by it but I already own a previous gen 16" macbook and you are right, it's just a tool and it's too expensive just to have the latest apple. The design made me remember my trusty old macbook 2012.
I would love to see recommendations for laptops that run similar or better than the m1max. I’m looking for a great workstation or gaming laptop that can run architecture programs like Revit. I would get the M1 max but it doesn’t run revit. Need a better alternative
7:01 - what happened, render issue?
Dave "Like i am 40 " ME 🤯
Thank you. I'm looking for a render machine (laptop) and you clarify the point (Premiere pro + After Effects).
If Apple is okay with making their laptops thicker then why the fuck didnt they do that with the Intel devices?????
5:06 Dave listening to NF
I think Davinci Resolve would’ve performed very similarly to Final Cut. Premiere is just not as optimized as the other two.
Keyword : " Tools ".
What Windows machine (specs) do you personally use for rendering in Premiere Pro?
God that thing is ugly. I'll take function over form, though.
"Everything is good when you go thicc" -Dave 2021
BTS boy 😂
Why not benchmark an MacBook Pro M1 Max power to a highend Intel/AMD laptop with 30X0 discret graphics and check the performance and batterylife! I Wonder how that will turnout!  And don't put in the power cord in neither machines!
They don’t have faceID because it is redundant with touchID and Apple Watch unlocking.
I have never gotten an mac and I dont plan to now either, I left iPhones years back and dont miss it. But in terms of unnecessary tech stuff, the 16inch is basicly the perfect portable video consumption machine. Display, speakers and battery make it far superior. Only problem you cant just open and dry it once you spilled coffee over it which really annoys me. Make it waterproof then so we can carefully rinse them. (had it once and I prefer the 45min cleaning process of a simple plastic cased laptop over an insurance claim and days without it..).
Dang! Thank you for finally comparing it with a worthy Windows alternative! Love your content :)
I just can't believe this guy is 40 😁
Everything's better when you go thick. - Dave2D 2021
It's true, the HDMI port is just for legacy support, the TB4 ports can do 4K120
yes, they're pretty good. But they're tools
love what u said  at last
No one id rather go to for tech advice than Dave.
How are you 40 you look 25 lol
Hear that ladies? Everything is good when you go THICCC ✨✨
WHAT? DAVE LEE IS 40 YEARS OLD? That man does not look a day older than 24.
No fucking way you are 40. I thought you were like 20?????? And I’m not even joking
you are forty? you look 32
Can’t wait to get the stickers 😅
Honestly can't decide between a 10 core M1 Pro 14" or a Razer Blade 14 w/ 3070...!!
Best intro ever.
Fave ID on M1 macs only makes sense; but I don’t know if they can fit it easily in the thin laptop lid
is that macbook wallpaper coming with the new MacBook?
You're 40?!?!
The last lines are my fav. "These are just tools"
You playing games and working on Mac ? THE FUTURE IS NOW, OLD MAN
THICC...
Windows Laptops: full function keys, ports, touch screens, 120hz screens, and dedicated graphics capable of running games and professional apps for past 5 years.  M1 Macbook Pros: these revolutionary new function keys and ports are amazing and the gpu is almost as good as an rtx 3060 and the 32gb of ram and 2tb of storage that would come standard in a premium gaming laptop is only a 1000$ upgrade. This is a game changer...  I pity you apple sheep.
'They are just tools' and most people won't need this. Exactly the thing I wanted to hear
"Everything is good when you go thick" 😅👌🏿
6:58 i think its from recording or while rendering
I love it when you say they are just tools!
This nigga looks half of his age. That Asian DNA don't crack
first video showing actual product, right?
The look is trash anyways :)
These are for those high end tech guys that have no budget. Not for us plebs for sure.
Dave: I'm 40. Kevin Hart: DAMN.
4:22 really good
I think he enjooooyyyeddd doing this video..... To see him so chirpy made my day🤗🤗
U're 40? u look like u're in ur early 30s 🤣
DAVE IS 40?!?!?!?!? WTF? Here I was thinking he was 28-30 max.
They are really good,  but they are just tools.- Dave Lee.   Think hard if you really need them.
What about the turbo mode?
ooooh very Powerbook shape niiiiceeee
Did you just SAY i am “40”????  You look great for your age man.
I DIDNT KNOW HE WAS 40
The only thing missing from this review was Optimus Prime. :)
Question, do you think this is worth it for gaming?
Cccc
Thanks Dave for talking me out of this one :)
This channel is full of lies. First, we never know when you're sitting down. Now you claim to be 40, but we all know that at some point you're gonna stand up from this figurative 'desk' and actually be 28 years old.
The disappointment on his face, when he said his family was watching BTS  Lmao
Yeah, not hardware accelerated for RED codecs.  I found the GPU chart odd? Ruins was way more frames than the 3080 🤔
I miss the old design of macbook pro so much. These new MacBook pro is so thick I can't even believe it
Why on earth would ANYONE still use Adobe première ? WHY ?
so can the 14” mackbook with the m1 pro run overwatch at a good playable rate?
U R 40!! WHAT!?
My 2015 MBP still chugging along. It recently started to slow down. The battery has been diminishing over time too, so I’m super tempted to upgrade to the 14” version maxed out for logic pro and final cut.
I'm want to see its performance in real application in machine learning not just numbers on a paper. Because on paper, it's beast and insane numbers!
THIS GUY IS 40?? 40?? FORTY??? I refuse to believe you sir!!
Would it be a good idea for school or what would you recommend ?
40?!
Im just shocked you are 40
"Everythings good when you go thicc"                                          -Dave Lee, 2021
Yup. Come for the review, stayed for the review, subbed for the honesty. This is why we are here, and why we are still here. Thanks for the honest info! :)
Not a chance in hell you are 40… I thought you were like 30 😂
I am honestly impressed that you look this young
YOU'RE 40?!?!! GIVE US THE ELIXIR holy shit you look amazing! Legit thought like mid 20s
Verge is like - we are testing it , we are testing that. ..... Dave is like - I have tested everything and here is the workflow.  :)
Why does every Dave2D video has a "that's what she said" moment?😅
I am 25 and you look younger then me so stop lying
Dave : it too costly College student: 🙄 why did u make this video 🤣😅  Just kidding ❤️ Dave Loved it❤️
This guy can't be 40 years.....28yrs maybe
how are you 40????  i srsly thaight you were mid 20s
Theres no way that apple in (insert year here) will put a camera that bad... Yeahhhhh, that would be true for most laptops including the macbook pro since 2010. Having a huge notch like that just for a decent webcam is terrible design
Really loved the message you sent about "you shouldn't buy it if you don't need it."
he's 40??????
Apple Apple Apple👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  What I admire about Apple is their ability to lead the rest of the market to the baguette and into the wall.  Apple is like this world record holder who pretends to make friends with those who can potentially break his record and make them believe that their strengths are weaknesses, so he is sure that his record will never be exceeded.  Apple has managed to make the entire mobile and computer industry believe that smartphone processors have no future in computers and that most ports (jack, SD card ...) are not needed.  And there bamm💥 Apple releases its M1 and then the M1 Pro with all the return ports 🤣.  Either all the other companies really have no vision or they are infiltrated and negatively influenced by Apple agents 🤷🏽‍♂️.  But really well done to Apple 🎩.
Another amazing, honest and truthful review.
I like you closed the video Dave. *They're cool but they're only tools.*  Speaks volumes and something that people often forget
I wish you were talking about the high impedance headphone jack.
😳. I thought you were 27, 28, or something.
If I look as good as Dave when I hit 40, life will have been good to me
Although these machines are really good, but you made me realise I actually don’t need them. Thanks.
Wow a sticker
Great review, Dave. Can’t wait for my 16” to arrive… in five weeks. 😫😆
Bench results are incredible considering Tomb Raider is under emulation.... wow 😮
Lol. This guy
“Everything is good when you go thick” (2D, Dave, October 2021)
He's 40 ???
i was watching this video casually and then he said "Everything is good when you go thick" i pause it & scrolled down to the comment section and everyone reaction was like "ok understandable "
I need those black apple stickers
you're 40?!
40 wtf 😵 You looks to be around your mid 30's
No Pixel 6 hands on yet Dave?
You know Apple means business when they slide in those black stickers
"Everything is good when you go thicc" - Dave, 2021.  Listen to your elder, people. He speaks wisdom.
Your final advice/conclusion helped me make up my mind. Since my workflow still works, and the speed is tolerable, guess I'll be coding/compiling on my trusty 2015 MBP for another year then.
This’s too expensive for me.
5:21 LOL WHAT, Daves life is a meme, I didn't think people actually watched BTS concerts
What with all these reviewers showing the new machines and NONE show the speakers audio quality??
Tx Dave
The notch🙃🥲
40??? And you're still so awesome. Wow
you are really 40? you look like end of 20s tbh
That NR200P on the background!!!!
Biased
"They're tools, that's all they are." A worthy and sane ending to an excellent video.
This might be one of the few rare times I feel truly excited when I see a suggested video. Already hit like before watching. I know you’re gonna deliver.
OMG! You're 40!

"Everything's good when you go thicc " -   dave 2021 , month of october
Wow Battery life doesn't come close to what was advertised by Apple.
Their tools not toys at those prices/performance figures.
It's good to have competition, not that I'll buy it ever in my life, but it's a good push to other brands
Love the green wallpaper
"Everything's good when you go thicc" You tell em Dave 👏👏
that grandpa voice is Legit
Actually I don't want a clear webcam.😂
Wait for your review abt Thinkpad Extreme Gen 4!
Thick is back ! Phil Schiller must be dead. If he is, he is rolling over in his grave !
Gatekeeping MacBook Pro…..jk 😬
40???
Thanks!, will be skipping this! Thought I could use it for good gaming. Seems sub par for gaming. Will go the eGPU route with my 2018 MacBook Pro.
Yup, at the end of the days, they're tools. Waiting for M2 Air with the new design O___O
lol 40?
Thanks Dave. This is why I trust you. You made me NOT overspend on this with your message at the end.
starting at $2,000 ?? please apple.
Thank you for the last thought on purchase decision.
why don't they use a periscope lens design. then it can fit any resolution camera I guess.
how to play overwatch on a Mac?
Right! Apple’s cameras are way better. So I definitely understand the notch.  Wow. You definitely don’t look 40. I thought you were younger. Cool
Clear ASF! How a review should be..
THICC
here i thought he was 28, who would have guessed dave was 40 years old. 😆
Dave is 40. He looks younger than me and I'm 17 wtf
Ahhhaaa found grandpa Simpson 😂😂
Can you do a MacBook Pro 17’ 2011 Vs. a MacBook Pro 16.2’ 2021 comparison?
stop telling me to make good fiscal decisions :(
Dave being 40 caught me off guard tbh. Guy looks 10 years younger than he is
As a gamer who's deep in the apple ecosystem, I'm just waiting for apple to catch up in terms of gaming so I can fully convert from windows to apple.
ncie vid! Hope you can do a gaming comparison to RTX3080 and 3d modelling softwares like Blender.
1:17 That's what my GF told me
excuse me? did this man just say hes 40?
today you are so happy I have never seen you happy as this level
He's the most 26 year old looking 40 year old I've ever seen
1:17 “Everything is good when you go thiccc” -Dave 2D 2021 A man of culture
Yep; people want to think these will replace all NVIDIA dGPUs and x86 machines by just blowing them all out the water...without realizing that the main reason these are so good are because they are heavily optimized for specific workflows, because they are tools to do a job
Everything's Good when youre thiCCCC
Wait you’re not 28 😳😳😳???
"Everything's good when you go thicc" - Dave2D
40??!!! wtf
Wait wait wait, HOW OLD DID HE SAY HE IS?
I am in no way bothered with the lack of FaceID due to the fact that I can't use it like 75% of the time anyways.
The only thing it matters in this video is that ave is 40 years old.Bro the fuck wait which cream are you using.say that first then about M1 or M2 watever.
The most honest and clean review out there. You're awesome Dave.
I simply do not know what it is but Dave’s videos are just comfortable to watch, chill. This had to be the first review I watch for the new MBP
"Everything is good when you go thick" dave2d, 2021
Razer macbook lookalike 😱
I am buying that M1 Max beast absolutely. no doubt in my mind.
Bro I am so happy for the last sentence, I got the m1 air 13 last month and it's been amazing. I got it because the wait for these machines were so long and now I don't regret it at all, I paid 1400$ total for 16gb,512gb m1 air with an airpods pro + taxes. That's way better than the starting price of 2000$!
He is in his 40's? 😮😮😮
Okay the real shocker in this video is that I found out Dave’s 40 y/o…
Wait wait wait… you’re 40?!? You are aging VERY well, my dude! Also, great review!
if its not expensive, its not apple. i cant even the repair (Buy a new one) price that apple will pull on this one.
We're just going to glance over that this thing can run overwatch... @120FPS.... in parallels???  Can you elaborate a little more?
“Everything’s good when you go thick”, can’t argue with that
The fact that I’ll finally be able to use Blender and Unity at a respectable frame rate and level of performance while on battery, in a time measured in hours, not minutes, is all I needed to hear.
Ah yes, another video from my favorite reviewer. Always unbiased.
Between the two, would you recommend the Razer Blade 14 or this MacBook Pro 14"?
Happy I am gonna keep my PC
40?  Damn.
Oh god Dave is 40.
40! What?
The edges where the wrist rests look so sharp and uncomfortable
I feel personally attacked with dave’s comment at the end. I really want one but have no need. Probably get the Air or a framework
I thought you were 26
Same boat. Looks amazing. I have no real reason to purchase one though. Will look forward to picking one up on sale in a year or two though.
Freaking ugly notch..
Thanks for the review Dave, I was waiting for it, and now I know that for my use case and the little extra performance (cpu wise) I'm better off with buying macbook air m1 instead of these ones and just stream my games from my gaming pc.
"I'm 40 right" me: O.O YOU'RE WHAT?
Did he just say he's 40 😃 I dead ass thought he was 25
wtf how are you 40 man
Some solid comedy in this one
40!?!?!? Share your routineeeee
Damn you, Dave, for bringing that wise perspective at the end of the video … but you’re right, I don’t NEED one of these thicc boys, but I might die a little inside if I don’t get one!
My 13" mbp m1 still stands with them with single core.
Nobody gonna believe you’re 40 dave 🥲 even with that grandpa voice…just tell us your real age 🙏🏻 25? Or the most 33? 🤣
If I hadn't seen the PC build, I would've thought that setup in the back was a 3D model.
If it was a different company that did this yall would complain about the notch on a laptop Unsubbed!
Overwatch running at 120 FPS on a Parallels VM, was it 4K?
Everything's good when you go thicc. ------ Dave 2021
waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit. "This is a real pro device, amazing for creators". "I think the hdmi is just if u're in a hury and need to do a presentation". huuuuuuuum this second argument ould have worked if those were regular macbooks, but I think pro are more interested into plugin this to external monitors to WORK
Everything’s good when you go thick…
He 40...the fuck
Dave is 40??? bruh mans look like 30.
Thick slabs of aluminium there. You love to see it! Not thin trash.
Lol Dave makes it sound like hdmi port= world peace
One a wise man said: Everything's good when you go thicc.
You are 40? What the fuck, are you a vampire?
Not gonna lie this is the first macbook i actually really want, i kinda wanna upgrade from my chromebook so hopfully soon i can ssve enough to get one
A video with the actual products... Thank you. I dont really enjoy things up in the air.
I wish Apple releases a MacBook Pro 16 inch but not have the pro parts in them.  Just need a little bigger screen than 13 inches on MacBook Air.
40? Damn dog
Damn, Dave looks good for 40
Wait!  This dude is 40?  I honestly thought something like 24
So when the youtubers refer to pros you all mean pro youtubers right, not all professionals, because let’s say you are in the construction or arquitectural sector, the MacBook doesn’t support the mayorista of PRO programs, like revit or pro rendering engines…. I mean this is a laptop for youtubers or musicians and that’s it, it’s to overkill for video editing, photo editing but for real think about the real work that pro people do, not everyone is just a youtuber.
They are "tools", crucial to be mindful. It will be sad if people take on debt or sacrifice their essential spending to splurge on what would be a sheer luxury toy. You must be honest in deciding if your requirements justify this purchase, don't get on the bandwagon foolishly.
"Everything is good when you go thiccc" - Dave Lee, 2021.  Thanks Dave. Haven't been feeling good about the extra kilos I gained this lockdown.
bruh. i thought you were 29
From a programmers point of view, Dave has got a point. Even an experienced programmer does not need this kind of power, the M1 MacBook Pro is more than enough. The only people who may need this kind of performance are 1. You are a video/audio editor. 2. You build very large programming projects (like Facebook, Google Maps, etc), in this case the company already gives you this kind of laptops. For the average consumer, please do consider the lower end M1 laptops first, and don’t spend 3k+ on laptops. Trust me, M1 is capable of handling all your workflow.  Only other reason I can think of: you want to buy a laptop that is future proof for at least 5 years.
I like it when it's thick..... Not sure can say the same about laptops though
What? He's 40??!?!?
Wait you are 40 years old.
Loved the honest advice at the end.
dude, 40 years old does not considered old )))
Wow, these macs are amazing and- WHAT--WAIT YOU'RE 40???
Lool, macbook has only 2.0 hdmi, which means that you cannot watch films, movies, games at 120hz. This is not pro. Sorry.
Loved the remark at the end of the video. Keep it up Dave!!
Yo if you 40 and noticing blurry vision looking at your computer or cell phone you might be hitting presbyopia age. Go see your local optometrist
4:17 #dave2old
Ayyy... Dave is bopping to some NF out here..
Did I miss any discussion on throttling?
BROOO that 14 inch is my favorite machine of the year It's so powerful for gaming and it's running ARM What else can I ask for
Hmm... Game performance near a low wattage 3060 (bigger wattages perform MUCH better). The hype was just too big, but it's a very nice machine.
White Apple stickers- for normal people Black Apple stickers- for pros Gold Apple stickers- for super rich Teal Apple stickers- for Dave
“Everything is good when you go thick”   Your eyes lit up as you said that
My notch/no FaceID assumption is that they were preparing this MacBook to have it. They submitted designs to their manufacturer for the new screens. The pandemic hit and many people are still wearing masks in public. Instead of needing to reformat the entire physical design of the new screens (which have had production issues to begin with due to the pandemic), they simply removed the FaceID function and will throw it in when we're a little further out of the pandemic.   I still don't understand the notch hate. Who the truck is using the center of their top bar? lol
"I'm 40". I swear I thought he was Marques' age.
Quote of the year: "Everything is good when you go thick"
Thank you for the last 30 seconds about them being tools. People are so fast to run out and get into debt for the image. $5k to look a certain way is... lol
u r 40 wtf u don't look like 40
You’re one of the few reviewers who state “if you don’t need it, don’t get it.” Well done Dave. 👍
40? you look 25
What you're 40?
The way Dave's hoodie color matches with the wallpaper on the smaller computer.. 👍
Only apple can make people so excited about an HDMI port. 5:35
7:03 for some reason the recording from windows shows green bar in premier.. you just need the change the extension of the file to get it working
How are you even 40! I thought you were in your mid 20s
Love the outro, 'these are tools, that's all they are'
Welcome to the notch world of laptops. You don't have to go so slim on laptops bezels to apply a notch. I have a Lenovo Legion 5i laptop with a camera at top with a physical privacy shutter.
Dave is 40?! 🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
Dave da legend is 40. You look like a 20, but how? Because 1:17 ?
Apple's next Macbook Pro 16" will be called the M2 THICC.  BTW, going by the scores Dave put up for Cinebench R23, comparing M1 with M1 Max, it's 38% higher score.  Does that translate to generally 38% more performance overall?  In Geekbench 5, an ASUS Zephyrus G15 with 3070 Mobile is either tied with the M1 Max or far exceeds it (there's a great variation in the scores, but most are 100K score range).  That's an $1800 Windows laptop with 165hz screen, 100% DCI-P3.  Hoping to see more M1 Max performance numbers in the coming days as more reviews come out.  But if it's 3060 Mobile performance at best, then while it's a big step forward for Macbooks, you can get comparable performance for considerably less with a G15.
Ohhhh baby!!
I’m surprised they didn’t do the nano coating option on these 🤷‍♂️
You really doesn't looks that excited.
AAHHHH i keep forgetting that hes 40!!!!
Love that kurzgesagt shout out!
Dave looking 23 YO: I'm 40...
oh my god you are 40? I thought you were 27 or something wkwkwk
Everything's good when you go thick.. That's whas she said
I liked the way you described the HDMI ports on the new MBP's :) Nice & Thanks :)
Just build a pc instead 🐸
This must be amazing but i couldn't afford it!
The teal cpu at the back chilling.
In the beginning of this video, I heard MacBook chromes lol  I turned my volume up
WAIT, YOU ARE 40?😵
I love the intro lol
That advice at the end was spot on.
No way he is 40! Excellent video !
Nah. Talk about web cam. The previous gen also the same quality. However, this is the greatest laptop of the year.
Why it only worked in safari? Was it exclusive?
"Notch is perfectly fine on this device"    Instant Dislike 👎
Wow.  Dave is 40!?!  I always assumed he was a mid-20 something.
Hi Dave, love your video. just wondering why you are still using premier pro and not final cut to edit 🤔
How will new MacBook work for AutoCAD? Or windows will be better
well said
That’s a really nice hoodie, pls share where got from
Yea I think you convinced me to keep my current machine, does what I need it to do I don’t really need a new laptop
First impression : It's pretty THICC
The biggest revelation in this review is that Dave is 40.
Ain’t no way Dave 40 I don’t believe it
Can you review apple stickers ?
I only disagree about the hdmi, in a pro device from the end of 2021 they should have putted in a 2.1
Now my goal in life is to look like Dave when I'm 40.
Thanks for this Review. 👌
its been a while i saw dave such excited about any laptop, especially the part about HDMI
I actually liked the touchbar.
Friend : what kind of girl do you want? Me : 1:17
Ummm...40??? 😳
Which windows driver did you use? I thought M1 macs are unable to do boot camps anymore.
OMG you are 40?????? you dont look a day over 29 mannnnn !!!
The BTS concert LMAO 🤣 IDK if I’m surprised or was I expecting that ha
Bloom? You mean what my eyes already see at night? 😔
You are 40? Damn I look older than you and I’m 20
Bit unexpected that XCode is so much faster on Max compared to Pro.
They're 100% planning FaceID. I'd bet anything the reason this one has a notch is so it won't look like a downgrade when future models have FaceID
Dave Your last line that you  want it but you dont need it must be the eye opener for many people , great insight ….
Hey dave. Can you gift me one. I'm a student and i am habitual of opening 10 chrome tabs at once. And only this PRO device can hold upto that.⚔💣🗿
Now that ports are back I hope it will affect other industry too. Idc if they making it a "feature" to put a headphone jack on a smartphone, I really hate the trend (thanks apple!). I know they did it to make money but tws does have it's own role. I use earbuds at home and really hate worrying about battery in tws earbuds, but I do use tws for working out or when I commuting.
He's 40? Dafuq
Dave reviews laptops. But he doesn't show any raw performance of the device. I mean anyone can tell physical aspects of a laptop using just images...right...why do companies provide him a model... LoL
@Dave2D what are your thoughts on the 32-core GPU in contrast to a RTX Quadro 5000 mobile (110W) found in the ThinkPad P17’s?
Yo, Dave starting to rock out some grey hairs?
Everything is good when you go thicc - Dave2D 😅
2016: WE MUST make these laptops smoller.  Thinner!!  More thinnererder!!!!!  2021 - okay, sorry we made a mistake, here is the thicc laptop with the ugly notch, take it!!  2023 - yeah, about that notch.... it is gone.
butterfly keyboard : all reviews were positive and after that all navigate , paid you-tubers   still Macbook keyboard sucks . cant trust these Silly reviews
The advice he gave in the last moment is the reason I'm subscribed to dave2d and watch his videos at first moment ❤️
Genuine Review, Loved It😊
F O R T Y ?
Very sober. Thank you Dave.
Someday I will use apple product for my daily usage. I'm poor.
Fortunately i find it horrible. Design looks very dated, the all-black keyboard is just ugly, and the notch... lol how dare they put a notch on a computer? Major fail housing such an incredible CPU. I guess i'm not surprised, this is apple after all.
"THICC"
Liked even before watching!  Thanks Dave
When it comes to computers: In Dave we Trust
For a student, is the 14in base model worth it over the old 13in M1 MBP?
YOU ARE 40?!
"They're really cool but they're just tools...that's what they are" - Dave2d. Probably the best advice to all of us. Thank you for your wisdom.
01:15 Everything good when you go THICK…….Thats what she said…..😎😎😎😜
My biggest takeway from this review is that you're 40 👀 (damn!)
The fish tank in the background is a little sad looking. Could use some more decorations to give the fish places to hide.
are their USB type-C charging speed the same as magsafe?
R U forty??!??? Where are U live what are U eating ?!???????
Your voice acting as a 80 years o' man is amazing
wait what. dave is 40???? how is that even possible
Love your honest reviews 🖤
Everything's good if you go thicc 😂
Dave are you really 40 or there was mistake with your ID? No way!!!
Everything is good when you go *T H I C C*  - Dave 2021
My 2020 16 inches is noisy as a jet 🛩 after opening some chrome tabs, video chat and external monitors…. Even my previous 2017 15 inches was better than that. It was my worst experience with Apple.
You are 40 like What???
Nice video ♥ , Btw apple put the notch just for a signature design because otherwise it will look like some pc's.
Those wallpapers remind me of the Galaxy S7
❤️
Dave likes it thicc
You don't get the black stickers with the Pro Display XDR :(
Hey can you provide a tutorial or share a link how did you install overwatch on M chip?
Wow dave is getting old 😂😂
wtf? you are 40? I thought you are in your early 30s.
damn you really hit me with that sweet sweet dose of reality at the end
What specs would you recommend for a professional photographer, retoucher, and 4k editor using davinci resolve, photoshop and capture one? Would the M1 pro 14in 1tb 32gb ram be more than enough for those? Or would you recommend a different configuration?
You missed a fact For a 4500USD Laptop the performance sucks, Razer Blade 17 - Full HD 360Hz  costs 3299USD. And it is 10 Times better than MAC. APPLE IS STILL A SCAM. I don't care about Apple Fan boys Crying over my comment section
Dave, thanks for what you said in the last part of the video "these are just tools". I bought a 16" Macbook Pro last year after watching your "My Super Weird 2020 iMac "Review"" because I really really needed a laptop at that point couldn't wait another year for the new generations of the MBPs. Last week when Apple announced the new lineup, I was feeling bad cause it felt like they abandoned the 2016-2019 users. But then this video reminded me again, they are just tools :)   Ps - For anyone who wants to check the video out , please do  .. its a remainder of why Dave is an awesome tech reviewer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFCVvy0rkE
Your testing on the 14 core, isn’t that a binned chip? Be better to test the 16 core on the 14 inch pro.
$3k Facebook machine …
Batman trailer and NF's search in the same vieo  Dave, did you checky YouTube account?
The fact you got 120fps on windows inside a VM with outdated drivers is actually completely wild.
“I’m 40?” What? I thought he was in his late 20’s.
So.. Dave use the PC standing up right?
This is the best Windows laptop haha.
I was thinking of buying it but then you said the last line, it's just a tool and buy it if you need one. Not gonna buy it. Sorry Apple 😋😋
WTF Dave is 40?
08:22 "They're tools, that's all they are." I cannot stress enough on how important and well put this is. You do not "need" to buy this "now". Cool things are cool to look at but not always so cool to buy on impulse. Very nice review Dave!
These laps are breakthrough innovation I love it. But they are apple they need instant recognition so Notch is here for all those people who are  wondering. fun part they don't care about look of the display branding surpasses according the brilliant engineering team behind that 🤦
Love the music @dave you're awesome!
oooh "black stickers"! fuck me sideways
Only got from the vid was DAVE’S 40! Whut??  These Macbook Pros look sick tho. 👌🏽👌🏽
They're really cool, but they're just tools -- wise words from Dave
looks like a brick :/ nice design verry nice :/ welcome in 2009
Disappointed by the misleading title.  I was expecting you to compare the M1max chip in both the 14” and 16” models - but you actually have the M1pro in the 14”.  I’m wondering if they perform identically - or if they’ve maybe set a lower clock speed on the 14” (to generate less heat?)
Wait wtf, dave is 40 !
1:23 I think I'm okay with a notch on a laptop. It certainly look better on a PC than on a smartphone.  I had a feeling that Windows PC might follow this trend soon. Now I wonder, if either Windows or Mac will be the first to give a punch hole camera into their laptop screen or not.
This is the best review ever, Love your advice at the end. It’s very true
"THICKER IS BETTER"- Dave2D
Tomb Raider, even though it supports the Metal graphics API, is not an M1-native game, right? It's still running through Rosetta 2. So, a better comparison would be to use a game that has been optimized for M1 and compare it to the 3080. I think we might see an improvement in FPS compared to Rosetta 2 games and the M1 Max might be a lot closer to the 100W 3080 than it seems.
5:22 … ewww! 🥴
They're really cool but they are tools. It saved me 3000$ thanks
Dave said he's 40, but we know hes 04 years old, can't lie, we know you Dave.
👏 They are really cool but tools! 👏
Thanks Dave  i almost got lost in the hype. here i was thinking this was a 3080 killer, that ran on a fraction of the power for 21 hours straight  in reality, its just usual apple spin. better than the windows alternative with apple tax. for the money, a windows PC with Ryzen & a 3080 blows this out of the water and you dont have to go through apple loopholes to game. I even wonder if this laptop has DLSS? if not then even a 3060 would probably beat it  I think i would prefer to see an M1 chip in a nintendo switch type device.
They look THICC
4:19 THIS GUY IS 40???/// DAMN HE LOOKS LIKE 26 THO
The last comments are so true.. its temting tho.  ..i dont need it.. i dont need it.. i want it! …i dont wan…  Will end up buying it anyway..
Bruh 🤣 I thought you were like 27 lol
I have to wait probably until the end of Q1 2022 to buy it in my country... and with distributor price since there is no apple store in my country... 😞
if you are like me, who wonders how will the mouse cursor behavior with the notch, I'm here to save you  01:35 mouse cursor just goes right through it
Why are they giving charging adapter with the device? The environment's hurting. 🥺
Love the thickness 🤤
i just hate the design
Let's keep the performance aside I'm shocked to know that you are 40. I thought u were 29 or 30 at best
I’m so excited for these! I ordered the 14” fully loaded specifically to use FCP again now that my student Adobe sub ran out and I can’t pay the pro rates.
so you made me feel convinced that 8gb m1 air is the way in 2021
Yeah Adobe sh!t is never optimized. I spent $5000 on tools to make $500,000, well, I say the ROI is quite good for me.
What! you're 40!!!! 😳
Dam, apple really got their customers going giddy over STICKERS.... that's marketing
4:41 … 40? Who you kidding? … get out here!! No way you are 40
Everything's good when you go thicc: wisdom master dave
everything is good when its THICK😉
They should make it for gaming 😜
YOU'RE 40???? Dude you look 25
The shape kind of reminds me of the Asus Tuf gaming laptop in a way.
Is it possible to set the screen to 120hz manually? @dave2d
Funny how went from no tables to Dave now havng two tables
No one can beat Apple products😍😍
"They are just tools", right now I feel confident to my empty wallet. 😊
Give me that wallpaper please.
"Everything is better when you go thiccc" *Takes notes* 📝
The advice at the end was spot on. Appreciate that.
can you do a full review more detail one
Dev is like a rich friend who always want us to make good purchase decisions... He don't want us to waste any money.
Hahaha if some other make had gone think that will be big no no.
I really like “They are really cool, but they are just tools”
It should play games given the price. That shouldn't be a surprise
The boxy design looks so bad imo 😕
You're freakin 40? I thought that you were 25.
4:22 "what bloom" 😂
Dame most surprising thing about this video is finding out that Dave is 40yrs old. The dude looks like he's 20yrs old instead!
wow 40, ur in great shape
why is cpu score much lower on 14 inch then 16 inch?
THICC
How fast are the 4tb and 8tb hard drives? do we know anything about their reliability or performance?
Dave is 40!!!!
You're 40????!!!! I wouldn't have even questioned you being in your 20s.
I really wish these laptops runs windows with this level of optimization.
😳40??????
You just have to use software that's optimized for the M1 architecture.  Otherwise, don't bother.
This is why I love Dave. He really speaks to you as if he was advising a friend over a coffee. I found myself intrigued by the MBP Max and tempted to delve deeper but the caveat Dave at the end spoke to me. Being reminded that ultimately, these things are tools genuinely was the best advice I could have gotten!
I hate that new (old) design, it looks terrible.
What about 3D performance, when it come to render images from software like Maya and C4D. Will this Macbook pro hold up ?
Biggest shocker in this review: „I’m 40.“
"Everything's good when you go THICCC"                                                                         - Dave2D
Great, been dying to get a new MBP to replace my 2017. The fan noise in a quiet office is epic. Enjoying the compact presentation in your videos!
Someone needed to pee, otherwise why talking like in a hurry
Not worth buying it’s too expensive!!
keep up the good work!!
They’re thiccc – and that’s a good thing
Rendering issues at 7:00m? @Dave2D
Dave, we love you already. No need to lie. We all know you’re 31 and not 40.
So cute!
Everything is good when you go thick - Dave 2021
30" of MacBooks)) We love it
Thanks for the performance metrics and thoughts. One of the features I was still curious about was Apple's claim that you can still achieve full performance on battery. Can you confirm if that is true?
you are 40 ? WTF
man HDMI 2.0 is a dealbreaker. Apple is giving us last gen hardware thinking most mbp users don't focus on the detailed specs.
Great review. The only thing I have an issue with is where you said you're 40. No way! You don't look a day older than 25.
I just now became aware of Dave2D by perusing Reddit. This is a very good review,to say the least. It's a review that I actually BELIEVE. I'm now subscribed and look forward to future videos. Well done, Dave2D. Thank You!
Dave is 40…… he looks 29.
Wait he’s 40??? He looks extremely young as a college kid !
And Where is Other Tech Youtubers😂
40? You look half the age
but how are the temps ?
The notch is still stupid. An iPhone SE 2020 selfie camera would fit PERFECTLY there without the need of a notch. I still don’t get it. They already have the parts..
Apple has set a new standard for price.
Hi
they look kinda ugly ngl
40????? wtf how to have those genes?
40? What?
Wow the new design really look like the macbook from 2013 with the removable part for change battery or HDD ! And also lool like the white old one
You are 40!? Haha
please make a comparison video between top model of Alienware x17 vs XPS 17 vs Mackbook pro !6 M1 Max . Specially about display , CPU and GPU performance....
No way you're 40!
If the m1 chip is really that efficient, why does apple make it that much thicker? Shouldn't it be at least the same thickness.
Talk about expensive. When I got my surface laptop 1 (i7 512gb storage and 16 gb of ram), it was around $2100. So I guess the Macbook 14 isnt so bad after all.
can we start mining on this new macbook pros?
DAVEEEEE I LOVE YOU WOOHOO I WAS DYING FOR THIS REVIEW!
I almost had a heart attack at 6:57
Loved that NF the search video 👀
wait a sec, Dave is 40. lol
The clean desk behind with the new teal pc 💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
Well done my man: they are just tools! Finally a sensible reviewer! 👏🏼
Wait your 40?
The end was awesome!! They are just tools! If your workload doesn't suit it then don't buy!
Dave: "I'm 40"  Me: Sound a little sus
There must be something off with your comparison charts because the M1 13 inch MacBook Pro was already competing with the Core i9 16 inch, so to see the core i7 16 inch being able to keep up with the M1 Pro and Max was really iffy.
the 16 inch MBP speakers dont sound like laptop speakers they sound like a decent pair of small speakers tbh.
BTS!
These look great! But my M1 Pro is more then powerful enough for what I need right now. Realistically, very few people actually need the power these things can put out.
Dave loves the thickness 😫
I love the thickness 😂☺️
40?? You look 30 max.
My only take away on this video is Dave is 40
No way you are 40 no way
You're so great with your reviews man. Truly cool and composed.
Everything is good when you go thick🔥
You are 40!?!?
Why that ending song always sad :(
Dave: “Everything’s good when you go thick”
Pixel 6 review please.
If we learned anything today. Dave is in fact not a 27 y/o tech YouTuber. Guess  Asian really don’t raisin.
So glad to see tech reviewers treating those objects as tools and not quasi-sentient god-level life changing ntities of desire and status, such commodity fetichism at its finest. Keep it up!
"Everything is good when you go THICC"  HMMMMMM 👀
So nobody is gonna talk about that intro huh
Oh! This is the first review I have seen of them! Nice!
Nooo wayyyy he's 40. I thought he was 20 or 23
So nobody is gonna talk about that intro huh
"They're really cool, but they are tools". Hits right on the spot, Dave!
Thanks for the video! Any plans to do a gaming benchmark through Parallels? I'm interested in seeing how the new chips can handle Windows games.
So..... as a student i can just either go for an MBA M1 or the MBP M1 and not worry bout the chip being an year old??
RAM is still soldered? SSD is still soldered? Still not buying one.
Hold up, Dave is FORTY???? HOW
Awww yeah let's go! I was waiting for this. Skipped an office meeting for this.
"EVERYTHING IS GOOD WHEN YOU GO THICK" - Dave2D, 2021
WTF HE'S 40!!?
“Everything’s good when you go THICC” - Dave2D, October 2021
Ｗhat's up port!
So I am an engineer, will the new PRO line of Macbooks make my work easier? Oh I forgot it can't even run the software I am forced to use.. so much for the PRO moniker on the new Apple machines...
40? Are you kidding me? You look like 25
You’ve got a false account that has been created with your name on it… beware!
Dave casually dropping his age...   Me: WHAT!?!?!?
Stickers for pro. Wtf is this. They are fooling people
OH BOY WAS I WAITING FOR THIS
Man, these do look really awesome, but your words of caution against those who dont have a real "need" for them rings true. I enjoy photo editing in lightroom, im not a "pro", i just enjoy taking pictures. Although expensive, these do seem to tick the boxes im interested in: High res, large screen Pro motion mini-led (would prefer OLED, but its pretty darn good) High brightness Great battery life Good build quality SD Card slot (thank you!) and of course the performance, performance that presumably will last for many, many years.  Is there an alternative laptop you'd recommend to these new MB Pros?
which res OW was tested?
“They’re really cool but they’re tools. That’s all that they are”. Deep
40!? you holy shit I thought this dude was 26 lmaoo
You're FORTY???????
That last part, great reminder Dave! The Macbook Pros are cool but they're still tools
@Dave2D you prefer 14 or 16?
WAIT WHAT NO WAY DAVE IS 40 I REFUSE TO BELIVE HES 40 mother nature better run back dave his years right now 😭 he's 27 MAX
Maharaja Dave🙌🏼
Question: 967 Nits at time 2:46, is that while using SDR or HDR. If HDR, then what is the max brightness for SDR?
Wait wait wait. You said you threw parallels on the macbook and installed overwatch. Is overwatch now on arm windows or was the emulation just that good?
I think the m1 laptops will be more efficient based laptops will have a great battery than the new pros. but the new pros will take over edge at the performance department beating the m1 like twice - thrice good.
Everything is good when you go thick.
How can you play Overwatch on a Mac
Too good to buy for regular consumers. I'll wait for another 6yrs until the price drops a bit 😂
Would Intel MBPs have performed better (thermals) if Apple didn't sabotage them with those ultra thin bodies?
Abis ini semua laptop punya poni... tidak dipungkiti hal yg dilakukan apple akan diikuti sama yg lain.. parahnya kompetitor yg suka hina2 tapi jilat ludah sendiri
Dave: I love Thicc  Yeah we know dave, we know
5:15
IM SO EXCITED! I pick mines up tomorrow! I've been holding out so long on grabbing a  laptop and I'm glad I waited for the new MBP I'm studying computer science and I've been wanting to replace my desktop with a good laptop with the holy triangle of my needs. Performance, Battery, Display brightness.
“I’m 40” bro stop capping you’re 30 max
I’m going to start saving for the next iteration but for now my current MacBook Pro is fine. I honestly don’t even use my current MacBook Pro to its full potential so it’s not worth the upgrade but hopefully down the line
DAVE is 40? Wow!
The thicker the better! Dave2D
How are you 40? Does cellphone radiation make people not age? I was thinking you were my age and Im 28
I wonder how much is Apple paying Dave, he used to critic with apple, he now seems too biased
Every thing good when you got thick .... That's a very clear words to realize
Everything's good when you go thick - Dave2D
Why is Xcode full build 50% faster in Max vs Pro, when only different is GPU cores?
"every thing good when u go THICK"✌️🤭
Anyone else seeing the big green block at 6:57 ?
1:16 "Everything's good when you go thicc", Damn right
Apple put a horrible Webcam 1 year ago. They absolutely would put a shitty Webcam on these
"Everything is good when you go thick" Does.. does that apply to women too? Asking for a friend.
Important and totally relevant question….how was the BTS concert?
Wait Dave's 40
Who's your bias Dave don't be shy
Everything is good when you go thicc. . Fact!
Dave is FORTY!!??
Loved the conclusion.  No lies.
What Dave is 40 😱😱😱. I am more shocked to know this than MBP reveal.
40? Awesome
"I'm 40" 👁👄👁 Dave really said Asian dont Raisin
40!!! I thought you were 29
Everything is better when you go thick “” that what she said
I quit my zoom meeting where I am going to get a prize to watch this, I think, it was worthy
Apple in 2021: we care about pros so when upgrading from your old 2015 MacBook you will have one less port to plug stuff into and more importantly no way to plug a freaking pendrive.
Still like how Dave’s review of BOTH MacBooks is under 10 min, while others will put up 20 min reviews every day for a week lol
Everything is good when you go thicc 🤣
"everything is good when you go thicc“ - Dave2D , and I freakin live by that
Not gonna lie, the second the video opened and i saw the laptops closed i really loved the look of these things.
I had a little heart attack at 6:59
Shout out to your family listening to BTS
Me in the comments:  What I’m looking for:  Who should buy it and who shouldn’t.   What I actually find:  Dave is 40!  He said thicc is better!!!  He was watching BTS?? 😂
They tools your right…let me say like this a windows laptop need more maintenance after 2 years you can replace it.so every 2 years you can (not must) buy a new laptop.this MacBook you can use it for 6 years easy……windows laptop 3*1600=4800€..Sooo we’re is now the better and beautiful choice?😘😍🙈💪🏻
You don’t look a day older than 28
Dave is 40!?
Everything's ✍️ good ✍️ when ✍️ you ✍️ go ✍️ thick
Damn he is 40?
at this point, we shouldn't be surprised if they ended up putting that type of webcam in their pro devices. It's apple after all.
No lie, I thought you were fresh out of college 😂
Maybe the camera could be reduced in size and placed in the bezel, and apple could do that. It seems that this notch may already be an attempt to set a standard not only for the size of the 1080p camera, but also for sensors that can be put forward (like face id). Even if this is the reason, it is not enough for me to ignore the fact that this notch is a design failure.
Loved the outtro when he told people to not actually buy it if they didn't need it. 😁👍
Where can I get the green wallpaper?
Congrats to the Apple people, I guess. And their oversized wallets. You're getting that HDMI port now. Nice!
1:15 "Everything is good when you go thicc"
Been waiting for this.
Can anybody please tell me what typing software dave was using in the video !!
Thumbs up for Dave saying he likes em thicc
I think price is to performance ratio is better on M1 air these machines are really expensive 😓
4:20 lol dave is mimicry artist too
They are just tools.. Well said
My buddy brought up a good point. Apple has had these chips to refine software around for months. Adobe just got their hands on it so their software isn’t fluid with the new chips yet. It will get better and mire efficient over time.
I want the good display, 1000nits with hdr and true tone, also the great speakers, but I don't need the power. Hope there will be windows alternatives for my needs coming into the market very soon.
i thought dave like 30s
Dave is pretty thicc not going to lie
The black keyboard area looks awful, like some cheap plastic piece
Youre 40?????????????
"They are tools..that's what they are"..hits deep
STOP THE CAP YOU ARE NOT 40!!!
what's that green on the screen on apple website?
分厚い too thick😅
3000 € for the 16inch model, this is over price.
Bro thought u were 20 sth for all these years
I know they are tools but i can't wait for mine😁
Lets see how many manufacturers bring the notch in their laptops just because apple did. I hate this trend that everyone copies whatever apple does whether it is good or bad. Make those goddamn trackpads as good as macbooks. Don't copy some useless notch.
Can someone explain to me the Windows and Parallels thing? Did he install Windows on an ARM MacBook and played a game? I don't understand
I don’t really care that it does not have Face ID, but am seriously disappointed that it does not have a center stage camera like in the iPads.
Dave, you need to compare this god laptop against the devil laptop in blade 14.
I don’t hate the notch (on the laptop). I just think it’s funny lol
hold up. You are 40???? bruhh
So the new Macbook graphics now are on par with RTX 3060s?
The color palette in this video is just 🔥. So soothing. Is it the color grading? Seems… different.
Well leave it to Dave to break the mold and shatter the hype. What I’m getting is that these are good but not as good as the hype. Still think that notch is stupid. Video confirms it since you just hide the menu bar anyways so what’s the point of even cutting that screen out.
THANK YOU for the final thought Dave, people complaining about price and they (most of them) would use it for internet browsing Netflix & listen music. This products are focused on professional people not avg people.
2:42 I watched that video yesterday! Kurzgesagt has such a high quality content!!!
HE'S 40???!
Thickness gives you ports, bigger ports which allows you to put your small usb drive.
If the sound is no better than the 13 inch M1 mac pro it must be terrible then - thats a pity.
The last line is everything 🔥 🔥 🔥 About purchasing it
HOLD ON, you're 40? I just assumed you were closer to my age, 33. HUH. YOU look so young.
Oh my gosh!! How do you play Overwatch on an ARM Mac???? Plz tell me!! It means a big deal to me!!!
Dave’s old man voice took me tf out, I’m at work 😩😩😂  Damn, I so badly want the HDMI port, but I’m definitely not the market for this laptop 😭
"Everything is good when you go thick" -Dave2D   😏
Apple copying Razar laptops .. no one saying that ??
Hey Dave, yours was the first (and the LAST) review I'll watch on this computer!  Thanks for saving me the time and not being caught in the FOMO.  I'm quite happy with my 2021 MBA!
Greatest surprise in this review was the mentioning of your age...
Do we know if premiere has been updated to use the hardware accelerators for video encode? It seems like if they haven't done that yet, they should be waaaay faster than GPU/CPU rendering.
please compare it with 13 inch MacBook air? In India, new MacBooks costs 3 times than m1 air. Is it worth spending 3-4 times? One can buy 2 cars in the price of new macs and still save some money in India.
40!?!?!?!?
I love how you always honestly recommend products for a general user. Everyone else will be like buy it , its so awesome but you will be like its awesome but you dont need it . ❤️❤️
"Everything's good when you go thicc" -Dave2D
Great ending though5
This is why I fucking love dave so much, the ending message can really sway somoene's dumb decision of blowing their money on this machine but have no REAL use for it. Apple always seems to have a cult following for their high end devices with people instantly cashing in, and your message was just a reality check in my opinion. Its great hardware, but its a tool at the end of the day. Stay the same dave, we love you for this
Man are you really 40? Damn i am 24 and already look older than you.
My bank account thanks you for your honest review!
More shocking than M1 macbook being awesome is facing the truth that Dave is 40!!!!!!
Unfortunately.....Architects using revit can't take advantage of this
So wait... I don't need this?
why do you use premiere and not final cut?
how tf you are 40 man, you literally look like 26, good selfcare here
Its always funny to know that technically Apple just lifted the embargo on the 2021 MacBook Pro on 2021/10/25 1:00 PM UTC and you just see all the big channels pouring out its review video.
Holy shit he’s 40
Am I the only one who see the moment Apple jumps in a game industry with their powerful machines in near future?
Man. We all know the price. But there is nothing like it. I have mid 2014 Macpro still rocking and even after my daughter spilled a cup of water over it. I really do want to buy this even thou I am not a pro. Still resisting. Not sure for how long...
What is that typing speed test app you're using when you test the keyboard? It's gorgeous!
If there's no HDMI 2.1 for such expensive computer then it won't be able to do VRR on external displays with HDMI 2.1
Wait, f**k the review, Dave you are FORTY?! 🙀 Really just tell me it is -10 of that
Everything's good when you go thicc;)
Wait, you are 40?...
“Everything is good when you go thick.“  You knew when you said it…we could see it in your eyes.
Can’t wait to get my hands on the 14 in MacBook Pro. It’s been long overdue on my end for an upgrade.
That battery life is a major disappointment, substantially worse than last year.
What do you mean you're 40?
The biggest flex was the, "I'm forty".
the last part got me.
If you told me you’re 19 I would have believed it.
Damn black stickers? I’m sold, take my money apple XD
Dave you're 40?? have you been bitten by something at 25?
HE IS 40??????????? man black don't crack but Asian are immortal.
Bye bye touchbar you will (probably) not be missed
If you said you were 25 I would believe you
Imagine if apple would sell motherboards, cpu’s and ram for a pc. Everyone would buy them xD.
Meanwhile Microsoft surface laptop studio: 😭
I like the honesty with the not everyone needs it comment. Dont worry about 40s, they are the new 30s. 😏
Don’t mind the thickness whatsoever but don’t like the brickiness shape aesthetically
A wise man once said -  "Everything's good when you go thicc"
What typing test are you using?
so... You mean that apple is able to play games now?
Information collected : Dave is 40 and loves thiccness 😏
The most surpising feature of the macbook is that Dave is in his 40's
1:15 "Everything is good when you go thicc" ladies and gentlemen Dave2D 2021.
“I like thick” Me too, dave, me too
Bro it looks like my old 2008 mbp O_O
8:10 - the sober conclusion I needed 🙃
Wait what. You're 40? You look like 25
Dave: Dont buy it people unles you are pros.

"Everything is good when you go thick" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
These new MacBook Pro's are so cool and I was waiting for the release for so long! But I'll still stick with my 13" M1 MBP as it has more than enough power for my use cases. Plus the battery life is longer which is a massive positive for me.
Thank you for talking me off the ledge of my “fun purchase”. I’ll deposit $2800 in my daughters 529 account instead
1:18 You heard the man! Everythings good when you go thicc Lmaoo
“Everything is good when you go thicc”😏
Plz talk abt the thermalssssss
Tempted to get M1 pro base model with all that  fancy new ports… but my 2016 MBP still serving me well especially since Apple replaced my screen just several months ago so feels kinda new again
"Maybe this year I'll buy one" -me with 7 year old Lenovo y50 If perhaps Nvidia hadn't cheaper out and gone with Samsung for ampere, I would've gone that route. As it is, it looks like I'm waiting another year or possibly two for next gen GPUs and CPUs from Nvidia/AMD in laptops.
That old voice was pretty convincing
New design is a🤢 shit. I hope design manager  is fired.
man i thought u were 26. not 40
4:20 wtf ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
"Everything is good when you go THICC" - Dave Minaj
OK, I seriously had to stop the video to comment. I thought you were younger then me. I have so much grey hair and I'm only 35!!! And you are over here being 40 looking like a 29 y/o
No shot he’s 40. 28 at the oldest.
The New MacBoobs are thicc af.
Can’t believe that you are 40. You look and sound like 25-27
My family was watching the BTS concert *eye roll* lmao
How do you play Overwatch on MacOS?
Does magesafe 2 work of this MacBook?
am I the only one who thinks this is not a normal review? something is missing in this review.
damn u dont look like ur 40 :)
40!😦
I watch dave2D for initial review.. then i warch (with my wife) peter mckinnon to convince her that i need this 😬
first time for a long time I see Dave praised the MacBook Pro
Am I crazy or is Apple's design getting stale? This looks so unattractive compared to my white/metallic Zephyrus laptop
…did he say 40???
YOU ARE 40?!  Better grades, better salaries, better looks and aging...   leave some for the rest. Is there anything God cut the Asians short of?
Tell it like it is.  I like that approach.
Those last words got me man, Thanks for being honest and not pushing people to purchase new gadgets out of hype.
Hey, Good review! What app did you use while testing the keyboard on 4:40?
HOW IS DAVE 40 YEARS OLD? He looks 25
he's FORTY? bruh I thought he was in his late 20's 😭
At the end of the day they’re tools and are useless if you don’t have a use for them
I'm genuinely surprised the cinebench score wasn't higher for the m1 max. It's about the same as the legion 5 pro with the ryzen 7 5800h Not hating on Apple though. i'd totally buy the macbook if I coulf
Fatboys in the house 😁
Dave is 40? Wth!!
Dave is 40? Damn, he looks like an early 30s at most to me
WTF Dave, you look younger than me, you’re 40? Wow
do the wallpapers come with them? if not can you share the links?
Ur telling me this mini LED looks just as black as an OLED but without the issues of burn in? Gah dayum
i edit video and do live streams and when i can get the work i dj with a Mac Book pro as a part of my gear running Serato dj.I also make my own edits ,mashups and productions with Serato studio.I am not fully pro.More part time but i will get the 16 inch either by Christmas or the new year .I have a pretty good Mac Book right now but i usually upgrade if there is something good coming up and this will be great.
That's Crazy your 40!!!
Dave: I love the Thiccness You sure do Dave
That notch though...
A.R.M.Y.!!! Lol
01:18 everything is good when you go thick …
Hmm. So I should just think about original plan of 16 inch and 2TB internal SSD, and not doing crazy update? That's interesting.
Everything's good when you go thick.  -Dave 2021
Nice final message!
Everything's good when you go thick
Had to check the playback speed
hope i look half as good as u at 40! goddamn
This year Apple really focused on performance then looks
« Everything’s good when you go THICC » 1:17
Maybe the MBP is the king in battery life, but the tested values are far off the advertised ones. And the performance overall also not that impressive as advertised.  As I already told: the benefits of a complete SoC-build finds it's limits as the chip sizes and memory sizes increase.
"Everything is good when you go thicc."
Literally any laptop launches I come here to see Dave's thoughts💗
U r 40 wtf....u look 25
why is the m1 max gpu  running behind with the 3080? cuz it's still at ✨L O W  P O W E R✨
No way you’re 40!
That final cut render time. lol.   It seems like you either didn't know, or you forgot to mention it, but what about that "High performance mode" on M1 max that appears to deliver "extreme levels of performance" (according to apple)?
Amazing video Dave, but I am more confused now... I was thinking in buying the M1 max since I am a professional graphic designer/ illustrator so do you think I should buy it or the M1 pro? Thank you,
I appreciate the final thought…. Cause I love the idea but I really want Face ID…. And… I liked the Touch Bar.
wtf he's 40 I always thought he was younger than me
new mbp are kinda thicc though... what's your thoughts about it?
You’re 40? 👀 wtf
Wowowowow i want one
yo dave2d looks like he lives inside a bank vault
wait what no way hes 40
That last part I needed to hear cause my heart wanted it but my brain was on the fence.
i little bit dissappointed by the result that M1 Max didn't scale extremely well in video rendering scenario. But the device itself is amazing. But still not worth the money if you didn't use it for professional use.
How about the mining performance? xD
I have an URGENT NEED! I have a live music and light show workflow which requires MacOS, prefers native HDMI, requires hard-wiring to two displays, and uses over 50% of the M1 CPU on my Mac mini. So use my Mac mini, right? No, thanks. That’s my backup. I need a laptop so I can edit audio away from my desk. I’m over sitting in the same place all day. And I’m not going to buy a dedicated gaming laptop, so $400 more for Maximum GPU doesn’t seem like a high price to pay. Hence, I got the $3500 model 16”
Thanks dave, i mean it thanks for making all this review
5:05  Weird coincidence but I listened to the search just before this video
Spot on Dave. These are not for the everyday laptop user. These are mobile workstations that are great for a very specific class of professionals.  They are also very competitively priced, if you compare them against the Dell Precision 7xxx series laptops.  The entry level 16” model is also great for those who just want a laptop with a bigger screen.  Nonetheless, these machines show the specs of commodity laptops that we will be able to buy for 1K in 3 years.
Wait he is 40! Damn he looks around 25 to 30 to me
Everything's good when you go thick
Here to see mouse pointer moving through notch !
Damn Dave, your Hanzo skills are on point.
Dave is 40 you guys 💀
WHAT THE FUCK, DAVE IS 40???
Can someone break Dave out of this prison cell?
Removes features, throws in crappy gimmicks, puts back features, removes crappy gimmicks.
How different are the speakers for the 14 and 16?
Apple could have made it a punch hole though! There's no need for a notch as wide as that!
Everything is good when you go thick.  ~Dave
Need to get one of these when Ableton is fully supported + few of my fave plug-in companies
I can't believe Dave is only 43 years old.
Man 40 is not old really.
@ 5:38 what type pf reasoning is that?? So they could not put a 2.1 because of what exactly?
The punch line is best.
He is 40 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I agree with Rene, the lack of face id is payments possibly being taken and authenticated whilst unaware
"Everything's good when you go thicc" 😏  - Dave2D
so we gonna ignore that he is 40 years old looking 30?
This guy is 40?!!!??
Great video
Amount of sadness when he say that his family watches BTS concert 😂
I wonder if they'll keep the "base" M chips to the air. If so, what will the M2 chips focus on? More efficiency and battery life with the same M1 performance maybe? hmmm
If it had FaceId, it would be a living hell to replace the screen if it was ever damaged.
“They are tools” 🙌❤️👏
4:22 Bruh, so gooood
They look GREAT! Can't wait to get mine.💯👍💪
Thanks for your Honest opinion. That's why I love you DAVE
Would recommend 14” for an IT student  And it will stay for about 5 years at least until purchase another one
THIS MAN IS 40 YEARS OLD??
Y'all hear ,"Everything's good when you go thick "            -Dave Lee
where's the unboxing video?
omg wow
Amazing.
Thumbs up for that closing thought. I love to hear more tech reviewers be honest about purchase decisions.
You're 40? Wtf man, i thought you were in your early twenties.
"They are really cool but they are tools. That's all they are."
My MacBook Air m1 performance is so good, no application can catch up. Still right now, most of Mac app haven’t adopt for m1(which means slow intel chip application)
Thank you for saying that most people probably don't need this! I see so many people who think they need a 16 inch MBP when they only use it for school or web browsing! It's total insanity. Consumers need to know when a product is not marketed towards them and when they need to save their money and buy a cheaper device. Love your videos Dave!
You are 40?!?! Dude, I thought you were like 25 or 30 at max. Wow
I want to know the performance difference of 14 inch vs 16 inch with m1 maxed out.
Beside all he told the last few couple of lines were the ones to be noticed...
Wait, dave is 40???
With this performance, it's gonna be the end for gaming laptops. I really hope that on the windows side they will be able to get similar chips as on the Macbooks. I have been wanting this for years, even before apple released the first M1 Macbook. Performance per wattage is what matters to me.
you sure your 40? can you check
You're forty? I thought you were younger than me! :D
40?? I think you look more of 20 at most tbh
Love the Ending Sentences...
youngest 40 years old
They're really cool.. but they're just tools.. thats all they are. Spot on! Lets stop being so obsessed with the latest and the greatest... the old ones are still good :)
aight but what sweat shirt are you wearing? I love it!
Glad to see M1 Max is over hyped, otherwise, I be considering selling a kidney for it.  Hope alder lake will be competitive next month.
I didn't know I needed grandpa Dave till now
1:11
U r 40? I thought you are 20 something
Why is Batman trying to escape your laptop?
Great to see Apple update the hardware, and I agree thicker machines more ports, Great to hear. Funny how pundits make excuses for design changes isnt it? Too slim no ports but oh how pretty but not today 😁 Anyway great to see the machine bring a decent processor onboard. might make the other CPU manufacturers ty a bit harder. And you are right the machine will excel at Apple software the beauty of a controlled and unified  architecture
I just dream of having a MacBook.
Dave : I'm 40 right, so- Me: yes and I am James Bond
The ending really helped me to take my decision
Dave you look at least 27 man
omg!! you are 40?
I like this one most! short,concentrate on important points. good summary and nice suggestion!
YOU'RE 40 ??????????????
I like the last comment, when you said they are just tools. Exactly, when we put aside the crazy consumerism, these are just tools, nothing more. Thanks, Dave.
Hold up…..pause…..40?!?!?  Who else thought he was 25 at best?  I didn’t know 40 year olds shop at the Kidz Gap. Rock on.  Back to the review.
You are 40? You don't look 40. Next video - How to anti-age?
you look 30 not 40
4000? I can get a better pc for 2000.
You're 40???!
Very helpful review. I'm about to buy the 16" M1 Max.
I'll stick with my m1 macbook air and Asus G15 combo until I can somehow play Apex on a macbook without compromises. Until then, they can put in a million GPU cores and it still won't matter for me.
Dave is 40 looking 20. Okay
GREAT video. I was tempted to get the 14'' but as a non-pro user I can't justify spending this much on a laptop. I will wait for the next MacBook Air.
"Everything is good when you go Thick" -Dave2D 2021
Glad that my 13 inch M1 Pro doesn’t feel obsolete. I don’t need all that power and prefer longer battery life and better portability.
Those are some thiccc laptops
What is the typing test you were using?
Everytime he says his age  There is something wrong  He shouldn't look younger 🤣🤣🤣
“I love the thickness…everything is good when you go thick” - Dave3d
Did you do the GPU testing while unplugged? That was one of the big Apple claims. I'd like to know exactly how it stands out against a 3080 equipped laptop while on battery and for how long can each of them go.
OMG you’re forty??!!
Dave's voice turned into Linus's voice for a second.
Too many quotable quotes in this single vlog! 🤓
FIRST (1hour after)
I thought you were 32. Damn, 40.
Wait, Dave is 40? He looks 25!
Thanks for this awesome review Dave!
Bro this dude is 40?!!😳😳 He looks 18 no cap!! And yeah i know what 18 yr olds look like cuz I am one;)
Dave, your review is undoubtedly the best among the early fews. Thanks.
Conclusion: still the macbook air m1 is the best deal for a macbook.
You should watch Rene Ritchie's videos. He clearly explains why Apple hasn't yet put FaceID on Macs.
So it looks like it doesn’t beat the 3080 mobile, but very impressive nonetheless. Really exciting to see these chips, and I’m someone who hates Apple with a passion. Also, coming from a 32 core gpu, this is also somewhat of a taste of what 5nm chips can dish out. Can’t wait to see AMD’s 5nm CPUs and what they can do.
I love how in touch you are with your base - that is you're ending comments are on the button. Every other reviewer on YouTube is : "It's awesome, it's so powerful; we've ordered 6!". You've got a 3.43M subscriber base and the revenue, but you know our (window shopping) budget. Good advice Dave2D
Apple smashed it out of the park fam
<\\\ SO MUCH FANTASTIC AND COOL EXCELLENT WORK>>>>>>>> #DAVE2D X #TECH SO MUCH INCREÍBLE EXCELLENT WORK>>>>>>>>>>
hope mb air next year have ports like mbp, no need dongle
dear touch bar lovers, what have you used it for?
Bloom? What bloom, I don't see any bloom... Now fetch me my teeth!
U wot mate? 40? Looking fine! Good review, my wallet thanks for the last part.
Bro u don't look 40
"Everything is good when you go thicc" - Dave2D, 2021
Would M1 Pro be good for web/app dev?
Can't the benchmark tests be cheated? Can we really trust benchmark tests?
To be honest image quality of MacBook PRO cam looks like crap. It's definitely could fit without that stupid notch.
Everything's good when it's thicc. 🙃
“Everything is good when you go tick” 😂
40??? I thought you’re 20 😳
Dave my man give me some advice on this should i install windows on these machines cuz i was thinking off getting one and then playing games That way and also use it for college for Programming
They are pro tools now, and not just looking cool. Having the Macbook Pro on the table at Starbucks won’t look as pretty as the last gen. 🙄
"everything is good when you go thick"....he loves to put weird sexual content in his videos I wonder how big of a freak he really is lol
YOU'RE 40??! I legit thought you were like 30 at most.
Dave you're 40???
That last bit of advice hit me hard :_) " They are just tools" "You don't need it" .... Okay Grandpa I'll take your advice.
i didnt care how my Mac book looked as long as it didnt crunch crash or overheat.I also wanted ports and if that meant a thicker machine then fine .Looks are not the most important thing when you have cpu heavy programs running.
Basically this is a 2013 case with 2021 internals
This is the reason I like Dave, he's always to the point.
Everything is good when you go thicc -Dave 2021
I bought an M1 earlier this year and its performed flawlessly. Now the M1 Pro and Max are here and Apple hit a grand slam
The design really pissed me off. 1. The lid portion is not as rounded as the bottom part. (Same as PowerBook) 2. The top corners are rounded but not for the bottom corners. 3. The notch is so big that it only houses one single camera. The old models look way better. Won't buy these ugly machines
Adobe just doesn't like Apple that much. That's why Adobe products are not much better than on Mac
Wait holddddd up! Dave is 40? 😲
Dave listening to NF!!!
A good tool can give you more producitivty.
I'm a kurzgesagt fan too!
huh you're 40? I'd give you 32
Am I the only one who wants Ethernet jack back? Now that Pro Macbooks are thick again, maybe some day?
I'm amazed that dave is only 40 years old
I don't know what's more shocking tbh. The performance on these things, or that you're 40. You look 39,5 at best!
These remind me of the exotic cars.. the teslas.. they are amazing from performance perspective but most people don’t need that. It’s good for ogling at and I am happy to do just that!
Excuse, did you just say you're 40? God damn you look so good for 40. Nice job!
Apple: This is a product for professionals, people specialised in video editing, photogr... Dave: WOOOH, Overwatch at 120 fps tho!!
I got the 14" to replace a 2013 15" MBP. I wonder if the M2 Macbook air will have the better ports/screen but with just an M2 chip. If so THAT would be the one to get for almost everyone.
Whattt Dave is 40?!
Dave's 40 !????!!?
I think the 14" Will be my first mac purchase. I have been in the market for a do everything laptop and then they announced this and it is just beautiful. And I can either drop 3 grand on a new desktop or a new laptop. I think my desktop can wait another generation.
I love the last part,   clearly it’s not cheap to buy if you only “want” this tool. It’s for the pros
When you said that you are 40 only then i noticed that you have grey hairs
I never understand the hype behind the stickers? Like where do you use them? Genuinely curious!
But for me, there is no reason to buy a mac if it is thick
When is the surface laptop studio vs MacBook pro happening???
hey dave time to fix ur video 6:59 glitchhhhh
“ You don’t need it ”- Dave Lee
But no usb type A .... But it is fine for a Mac
40
nf?? you a fan?
“Everything’s good when you go thicc”  So true man, so true😂
Remember folks, everything good when you go "thicc"
I thought this man and i had the same age HAHAHAAH man you look 25 at most what the fuck
The blacked out keyboard and inside of the ports seem to me that apple may be planning a black macbook pro....what do you think?
“Everything is good when you go thick” 💁🏼‍♂️😈👌🏻
This design just like 2007 white macbook.
Dave, for such exciting products, I was a bit underwhelmed by this review, then I saw iJustine’s video (granted it’s ijustine) and she ran some high demanding tasks with a video editor that really showed the power of these machines, it would be nice to see some demos like that from you, even though I understand your audience have a bigger grasp of gaming benchmarks, the pro workflow is what the machine is intended for
Waiting for ultimate mac mini
You're 40??
Dave2old
Hey Dave, how did you install and play Overwatch on these M1? (It’s one of the considerations that’s holding me back.)
Is the new trend for bots to quote what's being said in a video?
I think Dave was high today.. 😂
I'm starting a new job in December as a front-end software engineer and I've ordered myself one of those 16" beasts with 32GB RAM for a few reasons: 1. The ports; 2. The speed of the SOC; 3. The high refresh rate screen; 4. No more touch bar; 5. Screw Intel. Is it overkill? Yes. Yes it is. But that's the entire point. I won't have to wait for anything and I'll know that my computer won't be the limiting factor in any of my work.
I'm pointing with that ending people buy things they don't need. I love how he does that on most of his videos.
Bit apple have been happy to put the crappy webcam in their laptops for years lol
Just to remind you that Dave is 40 and looks younger than you and MKBHD… (Yeah we should talk about iJustine’s age as well…)
Simple , honest just Dave things. Loved the review 🙂
THE NOTCH IS NOT OK it's a fucking laptop you can make a reverse notch it doesn't have the same excuses as phones do
Does anyone know if getting the m1 max on the 14 inch version of the laptop have different performance or thermal measures than if you got the m1 max on the 16 inch? Thanks!
Glad Dave mentioned "Most people don't need it", we need more tech reviewers like you making sensible suggestions instead of pushing people to the newest and greatest. I have seen so many people with top end MBPs but use them like Chromebooks.
Crazy expensive it is. I planned to buy it if were the same price as usual. But 50% more... nah, I will keep my asus duo better. Because another reason is that M1 still having alot of compatibility issues with a lot of programs yet.
Honestly the best channel hands down. The piece of advice at the end is so important we should always keep in mind.
"It's crazy goooood!"  * starts at 2000 *  yea I'm pretty happy from my L5P 1400$
man,  YOU ARE 40 YEARS OLD?? i was sure that u are no more then 25 years!
“Everything’s good when you go thick” Okay Dave, I see you 👀
he's freakin 40? ID or it ain't true
Why so many people hate touch bar… I kinda liked it tbh.
Wait... Windows drivers? Overwatch? Is bootcamp supported on M1's now?
40 😯
How is there no body else talking about he is beiy 40? !😂 He's younger than me in my early 20s.
Dave: I mean, im 40  Me: How can i trust a review from someone who’s clearly lying to me, he’s 30 tops.
Dave is 40, but looks like.. under 30..
What's the battery hit from 120Hz when you tend to actively us it all day, even watching YouTube videos like we are here?

Great Video as always, btw you don't look 40
Nothing about this MBP impressed me more than Dave being 40.
can you use all 3 usb C ports to charge it as well? just curious like if you forgot the magsafe charger and wanted to borrow someone else's usb c charger

wow you get them fast ;)) i feel so good that the M1 max is only as fast as my AMD, now i dont feel the urge to buy that M1 max =)))
The so waiting tool!!!🙌
Hey Dave! Thanks for the review. I am starting my Youtube channel, dealing with 4k videos and some after effects work here and there, is the M1 Pro 16GB enough?
“Everything’s good when you go thicc” 😏😏😏
like your last summary, honest and direct, though all admit it's a great tool
"Have you seen the quality of this webcam? It's awful."  Bro, that camera is ***sooooo*** much better than the PoS 720p camera that my company issued ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with. The camera you showed looks clear and unpixelated, with good lighting.
That hoodie though. I NEED it.🔥
What the hell, he's 40?!?
Can't describe how happy i am seeing my man Dave watch the batman trailer @2:31 , since i'm a huge batman fan and apple fan, and I'm also very happy to see that the notch doesn't bother Dave, you just earned a sub buddy <3
I love the mbpro16. I hate the camara intrusion in the screen.
Omg.... finally. As a 2015 pro user, i want this so bad
well not regretting subbing this channel
What do you mean you’re 40? Lol fam I though you were like 25 lol
you are 40! i thought you were a kid
Damn you don’t look 40 at all
I don’t need this, I don’t need this, I don’t need this…
Very good purchase recommendation!
baseline 14 pro doesn't look to be much better than the normal m1 chip?
The reason that they bother to make an upgraded speaker is clear: Make sure that the competition will have a little bit more trouble to reach the same quality 😂
Shocked more about Dave's age than about MBPs' performances.
Damn, I always thought you were like 25 ish lol
I have a question. Since battery life is much better than your current laptop why dont you buy this ? Is battery life not that important to you or is your device still faster because of the dedicated gpu ?
Closing thoughts proved you are actually 40 yr old 😂
what he is 40 ?? never !
Love Dave's approach. He just saved me a ton of money.  This is how I like to be influenced. Lol.
I am 40 !! Well not in this world
Some honest, pragmatic advice at the end. Loved it.
Tbh the upprice going from the 13 inch M1 macbook pro to the 14 inch basemodel (8-core) just isnt worth it. What a shame.
he's 40? did i hear that right O_O
wait you’re 40? 😳
Wow, always wanted to even touch one
Let's take a min and appreciate how Dave was clicking heads in overwatch
4:50 Dave flexing on us by showing his insane movement in slither.io
I'm sorry but anyone there is better way for an individual to prove they are stupid than to pay 5000$ for a macbook
The only surprise is that Dave's 40???
4:33 who knows the name of this tool/app/website?
Ignore the Macbooks for a second, you're 40???
Everything's good when it's thicc                             ~ Dave2D, 2021
You look great for your age. 😊
I really like razer's simple laptop design and this is similar to it. I think the design is better than previous models.
... 40?  What
4:20 you're what
Ummm so dude is 40...  *Confused pikachu face
You are 40? Shocked!
Is Dave Stan’s Grandad from southpark??
Fancy seeing you using monkeytype 👊🏼
"everything is good when you go THICC" . Very wise words, nice.
Damn!! You are a senior, my guy!
Wait, you're 40? You age like wine!
I feel like a moron to just barely notice that Minecraft Steve has a Dave2D shirt on.
I don’t use Premier but just curious if it is optimized for M1 chips?
Fair review
Thank you for the webcam comparison. That XPS super small camera really does look like trash.
"Everything is better when you go thicc" 😆💀
That watch BTS concert 😂😂😂
"they are really cool but its tool" - dave2d, 2021
Holy hell you’re 40?? I was always thinking early 30s at most
Reminds me of the G4 Titanium
Everything is good when you go THICK !!!.....Dave2D coming to us with the realness 😅
Hey dave, can i get a reply?
"Everything's good in there when you go thicc"
Macbook pro review ❌ Dave is forty! ✅
in one fell swoop Dave not only answered all the gaming performance and battery life questions.  but also shut up all those whiners screaming "but the xps 13 doesnt have a notch" .
they look ugly
"Everything is good when you go thick." -  hahaha
The closing remark is 🔥.  The real truth many don’t want to 👂🏾
Fu** apple
the new Intro animation was good
Every time this dude tells me he is 40 my mind is blown away.
4:51 that wormate kill was SAVAGE
That's why we love Dave, nobody talks about those pro apple stickers in black.
40? FORTY?  Nah man I don't believe it. That must've just been for dramatic effect... right?
Perfect conclusions exist.... "They are really cool but they are tools"
The review I've been waiting for, even tho I'm not an apple user
“Everything is good when you go thick” 😉
You're 40?
twice as fast on xcode compared to 16" intel? must... resist... I just got my 16".... 3070-levels of performance is really great though
It's crazy to think apple managed to create a gpu that can keep up with nvidia stuff
You're 40!!! I thought you're like 28 or something!!!
It must pain Apple haters to not be able to say their trademark "aPpLe dOesn"T iNnoVate aNyMore wHen SteVE diED".
I was waiting so eagerly for this !! My favourite Apple devices next to iPhones
you look 28-30 dude
UR 40?
Let’s go Brandon
Wait a min, Dave is 40? He looks like he is in his early 30s haha
Hi i am from Afghanistan  For coding and video editing which computers do u advice me   Laptop or Desktop plz tell me 🙂🙂🙃
thats the best old man voice acting ive heart in a long while
I thought that the MacBooks would have less bloom than the iPads because the touch input layer changes somewhat how the light travels through the panel. That’s why touchless display assemblies historically have had more contrast than similar ones with touch.
How the fuck are you not like 28?
damn u're 40😱😱
"everything's good when go thick" -> great taste. I see.
Why the ugly notch???...Sorry, but I can't unsee it.😫Loved the honest summing up at the end of the video. Nice.👍😜
Every one will need this power sooner.
Once a wise man said, "Everything's good when you go thiccc" ;)
Nooooo Dave is a BTS fan. Unacceptable
1:17 - "Everything goes good when it's thicc" : Dave 2021😂
"im 40"  why that throw me off, like i know hes not in his 20's but damn he's actually 40
Nice video!   I plan to buy 14” maxed out MacBook Pro and I have a few questions:   How will 14” compare to 16” with same m1 max processor config?   Will the performance be throttled on 14” because it has lower wattage power adapter or less effective cooling because of its smaller form factor?   Is it worth getting 14” with maxed out m1 max processor or to harness m1 max’s full potential, we need to buy the 16”?  Hope I get a response on this one 🤞🏾. Thanks in advance. Love your videos 😇.
Dave, you are what ? 40? Please send me a list of your diet, because I want to look young as you when I am 40
thats how i watched the bts concert too, on my ancient mac, and it was awesome!! glad the new one has it too
DAVE IS 40?!!!!
- Cause thicker is good! - That's what she said
"Everything's good when you go thick."  ~ Dave2D
1) I like the thicness  2) you’re 40!?
Thought you were 25
I am wondering about gaming performance of 24 core GPU. If I have to give up on Bootcamp it should be satisfying to play games that supports Mac.
Thanks! Great vid. I want to throw in for the rest of y’all ( like me) who were tempted to buy this. Let’s wait til they pass down some of this tech to the more affordable MacBook pros and MacBook airs. I can see apple bringing ports back to those laptops. I can see apple putting Mini Led screens on MacBook Air in the future
lol, I don't think I'd ever choose a better quality webcam over not having a notch because webcams are such an irrelevant part of using a computer  Apple just put the notch there as a setback so they can claim its absence is a "feature" when the next MacBook without a notch hits the market
i'll wait till the notch is gone. :)

40!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! White hair I, didn't see that, ever
Thank you for saying that "it's very good but they are just very expensive tools"
Minecraft intro
You are telling me that you are 40?
The only thing that I find weird about the screen is that the upper 2 corners of the screen are rounded and the bottom 2 aren't.
Yep looks like I'll be selling my 2019 16 inch and grabbing the base 14!
Hey Dave, it'd be nice to know how it handles under pressure when rendering longer. The current 16" bogs down when hot hugely, could you tell us your findings on that??
I'm so glad Apple is finally listening to it's customers!
You’re 40?!?
YOU ARE 40? stop doing tech videos, start with skin care routine. I want that skin when I am 40
I may be wrong, but I think the quality of the camera don't justify the notch. Samsung makes a good camera fit on a tiny hole on their phone, a camera like that without a notch would be way nicer, than Apple's solution. And there's another detail, why put a notch so big for just a single camera?
Hold up. did he say 40??? I was sure he is like early 30 MAX!
All I needed to hear was- "you dont need it"
I liked his last point. All of these devices are just tools. I got a gaming laptop and I realised I have no other use of it other than to play games. Its screen and audio wasnt good enough for multimedia, nor am I a video editor/desinger or have any other use for the GPU. Could have just bought a console for 1/3rd price. There is no use to purchase expensive devices if you dont need them. Even with amount of hype, you will never need more processing power than an i5/ryzen 5 and even a GTX 940M which is 5-7 years old can run games .... (30 FPS is enough to game). Even to play E-sports 100-150 FPS is more than enough. Your KD wont increase with higher FPS !
It’s a powerful device but nearly useless to me as i can’t play games on this …………..
thicknedd gives you ports! LMAO couple of usb c
I would love to have comparable hardware of this build quality and performance where I can run Linux on for work
"Everything is good when you go thick" Hmmm....
"Everything is good when you go thic" - Dave, 2021
The last lines were the most honest and right lines
I miss the old slim design. The new one looks quite a bit stupid
"Wazzup... Port."
Wow, I think the most shocking part of this video is hearing that Dave is 40!  You definitely look a lot younger man, keep doing what you're doing cause it's clearly working!
BLACK APPLE STICKERS!!!! Yes. Actual Pro Laptops. Yes. Yes. Yes.
GPU compute still twice as weaker as 3080 is, per twice as more expensive as it is. So it is 4X worse in terms of GPU (classic Photoshop plugins etc, non-Metal/Vulkan-based APIs used)
He’s 40!? Wtf! I would have guessed 28-30
The verdict at the end... you are honest and again i like that
These are great for me as an AI person, deep learning software like Tensorflow uses the M1 GPUs. People keep pointing out graphics usage. These can be used for more than that.
Totally respect your unbiased opinions here Dave 👊🏻🙂 great video and quick reviews. 👍🏻 Was good to see and hear you show and comment about the comparison to Windows software with the video editing. I feel that’s info that a lot of people need to hear. These aren’t for me, even though I want one 😂 Ahhh, FOMO, such a wonderful thing…..
if i could have the prior year version of macbook pro with the 120 mhz pro motion, i would be so happy. i dont really need all the ports and stuff. and i happen to like the touch bar
Great review! But what about high power mode on 16"? I found it's really strange, that 32 gpu cores are not 2 times faster than 16.
#NOLENI #YESPAQUIAO #YESBBM #YESLACSON #YESISKO #YESRONALDBATO #NOLENI
Lol, now I just want a regular M1 in that 14 inch body. Don't need the performance, but the screen + ports would be nice.
The style of  macbook 14`remember the first macbook intel generations
Man I’m a windows user but hot damn these macs are good and hot damn the prices are definitely not cheap
Everything's good when you go thicc!
THICC=BEST
This time around they made the chassis thicker function over form like you said. During Intel days, Apple fan keep saying that Intel is to be blamed for making hotter chip.  When the first M1 was launched they repeated the same to satisfy their whatever. Here comes M1PRO and M1 MAX and Apple made the chassis bigger. ☹️  which simple shows that Apple has been sabotaging Intel all these years both in performance and removing the ports just for this day. They sabotaged Intel and gave us throttled product. We suffer because of their selfishness.
They are just tools.
"Everything is good when you go thicc" 😂😂
they are tools.....thanks
The end was the best! I am so hyped about these devices as a techi but I rly dont need them
1:15 Everything's good when you go thicc - Dave2D
40???
"They're really cool but they're tools, that's all they are". 🤯
Dave is no longer picky(in a good way),Sad
When the mouse goes through, does is jump or is there actual space ?
“Professional” is the name of macbook pro
I move that the two black Apple stickers for pros shall henceforth be called the Good Good
can't believe dave is still playing OW
I love the thickness …. Everything is good when you go thick . - that’s what she said !  Dad jokes.. ok imma out
YOU'R 40????? Damn, those genes are good.
"EVERYTHING is good when you go thicc" -words to live by
Thank you for keeping it real. Too many don't.
I didn't know u liked it thick dan😅🥲
Trillion dollar company finally makes computer that competes with billion dollar company. *Shock* still not upgradable, repairable, sustainable. Does it play Crysis? Nope :) I'll buy Apple when I can actually use it for more than two years.
I've been always liked your videos but now i like even more after you told that you watched the BTS concert!
Can you compare top of the line M1 Max 16" with top of the line M1 Max 14"?
How easy can someone repair these machines? No mention on repairability anymore? No criticism???
"Everything's good when you go thic"
crisp, short and informative. Way to go Dave. Loved the grandpa voice. :D
hands down best review on youtube for tech
That’s unbelievable! I thought u were like 30 max.
Kinda looks like a razerbook 13 ngl
you're 40?! what?! really? damnn
YOURE 40???
“Everything’s good when you go thicc.” 😉
To be honest as an Engineer professional, these new Macs aren't very useful or affordable for us. I am sure for an Youtuber or media editor it will be of great use. I wish there was also a Mac pro for us.  The youtubers were asking for it even though most of the end professionals won't need an expensive laptop like this. I am worried about the path the Youtubers take.
"Everything is Good , when you go THICK" 😎 . Dave 2021 .✌
dang I was hoping to buy this but this is just a tool..that made me change my decision, I am working fine with windows machine for coding..thank you😃
OMG IM SO GLAD I SKIPPED CLASSES LOL
You are 40?!
DAVE IS FORTY?!?!?! holy shit, I thought he was in his late 20's/ early 30's
Dave is 40??????
Stickers? That's pretty damn dumb.
You guys should take thermals more seriously into consideration for review. I had the 16 inch MacBook pro which I got from my company. It was a hot garbage, literally. It overheated to uncomfortable levels by just doing trivial tasks and for the few months I had it, some keys already started giving problems.
Dave’s face of pain when he said his family was watching a BTS concert 😂
Closing remarks were on point. We tech enthusiast need to remember sometimes that these are just tools. There is no need to bewail over not being able to buy them.
wow, professional stickers, the thing every "pro" needed
*That old man mimicry was op.*
why u so wholesome
Blender rendering tests please. Also Unity testing would be appreciated.
I am a regualr watcher of your channel...I am also near to 40 yrs...yes sadly our eye vision is going down..I can't see enemies clearly in games..lol...
LOL. According to Dave's review, which I take very serious, once the black stickers were mentioned in the packaging that was it. This was a solid device and no 2nd thoughts should even be contemplated on whether or not to purchase a MacBook Pro. No need for specs. No need for ergonomics. Black stickers. That's it.
he answered the question about the notch and the cursor hehe
2:20 Linus did a video about it Why laptop webcams sucks
Apple ThinkPad yep
First tech review guy I've come across on YouTube that I actually enjoyed the review from. Nicely presented. Not condescending. Good info. Thanks! :)
Are you really 40 , you look like you're 27
to answer the title - 14 + 16 = 30
I am so glad they are not thinner.
bro why were you watching the BTS concert, that's unacceptable.
dave's 40? wait what
This is too much for me. What do you buy if you’re just a regular person?
I trust Dave, his reviews are always first. But I don’t believe the man when he says he is 40.
40? really?
you really look young for your age
Samsung and android fanboys left the chat.
was that nf i saw in the speaker bit ??
Can you GPU render using a mac in premeire pro.
If I ran Apple, I would make damn sure that you never get early hardware ever again.  Your conclusion is basically telling people NOT TO BUY these products.  Everyone deserves a good color screen, quiet fans, good performance, and long battery life.  If ANYONE wants those things.. then they should buy these products.
It's too hear that you're 40. I thought u were maybe 25, 30ish at max!
I feel like apple is paying you
You are *FORTY*?????? WHATTT??  You look like 25 year old
omg dave is 40 now. You look young tho.
Thumbs for the purchase advice.
Stickers. That’s all one needs.
40 yo Dave look younger than 23 yo me
Can it Run Crysis 3...?
I just wish mine would arrive sooner than the late November date I was quoted 😭😭
bbut wait whatabout that dave give us  every new video a new angle of the studio  i love that studio btw and i can see that there is a lot of ideas can comeout from that place
4k laptop no OLED
Not gonna lie this gpu benchmarks were a bit if a crap companion, like a 100w 3080, seriously in any high end laptop with a 30 series gpu which are designed for the industry pros have wattages above 100w as a minimum, my £950 laptop has a 90w 3060 and you're comparing a 70w 3060 which is less than even my laptop with a laptop that is most certainly more than double 950.   I get the comparisons but I just think it's a little misleading because of the low watt gpus you compared the M1 Max to.
how are you 40 years old
4:18 " I'm 40,"  Bruh, I thought you were in  your late 20s or early 30s . 😯
Finally no more Dongle Book!!!
Your very honest thoughts at the end bro ✊
Very disappointed from Apple, but well, maybe next time. I'll wait.
Hey Dave, what fishes are in those planted tank
"they're tools... that's all they are" my wallet thanks you dave
if it wasn't for the notch it'd be perfect for me, but as it stands, the notch just triggers me, i hate screen intrusions
I'm surprised Apple reverted to their old design. Very unlike them, but in this case it looks like it worked out. It's a good thing that you don't recommend it to normies because that just means that it actually is a "pro" device. Most people would be fine with the MacBook Air. But finally, a pro Apple laptop that we can recommend to people who would need it. I'm still curious as to what will be the major flaw with this one though.
Do giveaway of 16pro
I want that hoodie :P
Great content Dave! Last few seconds is what I needed to hear. Keep it up, proud of you.
1:12 what Dave 2D really likes
Nailed it!
wow that was a sick review...
The fact that you point out the precise type of buyers that would want this is what I truly appreciate appreciate about Dave! Imagine buying such a powerful tool to edit word and browse the internet! When you can do that on an M1 at half the price point.
"everything good when you go thicc" - Dave 2021
Man, I definitely needed to hear those last few sentences.  Really want a new laptop, and was just looking at these, but, I don’t *need* something like this for casual use. Thanks for the realistic approach!
I'm still don't understand why they need this huge ugly notch. Why not just a hole for camera, or small square notch at least. Cursor under black box, wtf!
"Everything is good when you go thicc" Dave, 2021
Everything's good when you go thicc - Dave 2021
What you are 40???
Cool nice 👍 video is up.
Will you also review the Surface Laptop Studio?
I hope the notch does not become a trend in the industry because apple did it.
Ho Lee Phuc
"Everything is good when you go thicc"  And I took that seriously
Thanks for your honest recommend in the end. You are a rare species.
5:19 5:27 the excited tone ' this thing got the ports' 😂👌..wassup ..the port ..plug it up
stop cappin, you aint forty lol
when Im looking for honesty on tech, boy do I come to you
I just don't understand how apple still got praise for years of a shit keyboard,  completely lack of IO, removal of magsafe, no upgradability, a shit touchbar...   Why reviews didn't trash the overpriced shit they put forward for years?!?
I think I’m more shocked that you’re 40🤯 wow.. I work with 30 year olds that look twice as old 😂
Dave2D watches BTS lesgoooo
"Everything's good when you go thiccc"
8.5 hrs battery life? That's awful for an arm base cpu
get rid of the fucking notch please. I know I can't afford one, but holy moly that's ugly!
I reallyyyyy thought you were like 28-30??????????
blooming was obvious on my ipad pro so i had to return it, you didn't have to look in fully dark room to test it,   If they could really fix it on macbook with 1000nits why couldn't they fix it on iPads 600nits with a software / recall / new batch fix?  i was really hoping that you dedicated a full chapter to that issue cause it is REALLY important for those who choose this for accuracy and colors, the ipad even bled the light from the movies the black bars too, not just the WHITE ON BLACK issue!
yes, yes thicc is good
Your 40? Wow you look good.
My company is trying to buy me a spec'd out MacBook Pro (M1 Max) to replace my aging Xeon E5-2697 56 CPUs with a Quadro K5200, old machine I know, but I don't want a laptop to do my 3D work on especially since we render inhouse on my machine rather than using cloud rendering.
damn you are old
your hanzo headshot is bananas!
F*** the review, Dave is 40?  Jesus. No way in hell. He looks younger
1:16 well dave loves it thick lol
"Everything is good when you go thick"  Dave 2021
Always with stupid ass rational opinion to change my apple yippee fanboy mind. Now I’m not salivating as much as I was before and might just wait till next year. Thanks Dave 🤬
You can’t sell me on that notch. No way. I don’t care if you can see every pore on my face with that new camera lol! Also no Face ID and still making people have a notch. Weak.  Dell did it better sorry not sorry.
Hmm.. I'm not quite sure if your performance tests are really that relevant for people who will buy this machine.  5K RED Code transcodes into what? H.264? And more important: Nobody in your audience has a camera that produces REDRAW... Wouldn't it be more interesting to have a consumer friendly codec for a semi-professional audience review?  Also, Adobe is a really bad in optimizing their software to hardware acceleration - but I guess they will optimize it at some point since Apple uses a kind of closed product range a lot of people buying into: So is this the basic premiere pro 2021 over Rosetta? I'm a big fan of your reviews but this one feels a bit rushed and doesn't take this new hardware serious.
Is there something I'm missing about laptop webcams?  Even my old Note 9 selfie cam shoots better footage than the M1 webcam yet has a thinner bezel than even the XPS.
YOU'RE 40??
WAIT you're  40?! damn I wanna look that cute when I turn 40
I am in fact upset to see that you are a 3d person
7:00 what is that greenish bar at the bottom?
It’s fast, it’s reliable, and most importantly it’s THICC
Never are you 40!😨
Deve look 30 maybe 32 at best...40.my GOd.......!!!!
Looks like new silver razer blade with Apple 🤣🤣
No way you are 40 😲
This is just too thick to be called a latest Apple product…🥲
Mac air m1 and macbook pro 13" m1 have about the same single core performance, so why bother with these if you are not an video editor, graphic designer, etc. right? but the webcam is better so that's enough for convincing people to buy them anyway.
"this are just tools" you are so right
It really looks like the old macbook white. This new macbook a bit bulky somehow
Apple build the hardware that possible to make, and even how you replace a battery l, screen and next is keyboard replacement. genuine-ish!
These are just tools and very few people NEED this. People will buy it just to be trendy though 😂
You are 40 I was thinking youre not married and your in your twenties dude com on
Wow. I know i don't need that level of performance, but i need a 14 inch laptop
i suspect it doesn't have faceID to further differentiate it from the model where they do include faceId
Here we gooo!!!
LETS FRICKIN' GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Adobe photoshop? indesign?
Thank you for talking me out of buying one, phew
I wasn't even thinking about buying those but damn for that black Apple sticker I might consider selling my kidney.
"Everything's good when you go thicc"
4:50 damn Dave you got the move
1:16 so the great Dave2D has spoken so it shall be. From now on every good is thicc. Say no more fam.
wait you're 40????? you looks at most 30 to me lmao
M1 max vs RTX 3070 in Machine learning calculations ??
You're 40?
Great review as always Also that dude is 40?! Holy crap
I refuse to believe your a day above 27
I’m so sad that MBP became so pro that I don’t need them anymore..I’ve been waiting for 14’s screen for more than 6 months. But the price kills my budget, and its being as “a tool” kills my motives.
Honestly, the thickness is ugly...
*Noice. I wish I had one.*
You don’t look a day over 39 Dave 👶
DIDHE JUST SAY 3060?
best reviews , thanks
youre 40? dafuq, you look late 20s
Vada pav..Vada pav
Would have loved to see the regular M1 Chips in graphics and render times as well :)
I don’t even doubt the new MBPs have top notch performance.
It’s more surprising to me when u said u r 40.
Your 40??
40 years old??? in this build???? how???
Tim Cook has smashed another home run.
*“Everything’s good when you go thicc”* wise words from a wise man.
Thick is good
what a bomb drop ... 40?!
I appreciate the minecraft intro 😂
m1 max in 14 inch is tdp limited?
Can’t wait to apply the teck library at my work place for one of those...
Taking your advice! These are great machines for Pros, if you don´t need it you don´t need it. I hear you! Too expensive for me. I don´t need it.
Main question: do you NEED it?
6:57 I thought my phone died
That Old man Bloom impression killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 didn't expect that to be the highlight of the most highly anticipated video and device
Very very lucid review - as usual. Dave2D always manages to package essential technical and use case information into human relatable conversation form. An impressive ability.  The most interesting information was the performance improvement running Apple "native" applications - perhaps demonstrating the Full Stack Integration of hardware, operating system and application cumulative efficiency effect (not just hardware)?  With this technology I cannot see how Apple WILL not make huge inroads into Consumer Market especially with Air M2.  I presume strategy with these top end devices is getting serious media/creatives on board with the Apple Ecosystem and in turn application developers which will then trickle further into consumer market place where I think Apple is going to sell as said more and more devices because of the fundamental integration which can drive even more convenient, secure, faster and for the consumer simpler to use devices...
You’re 40???
Was coming here first for any reviews of the MBPs, Dave.  👊🇦🇺
i was going to just get the M1 air, and upgrade the specs... but it the difference in price between a specced out air and the 14" is almost immaterial given how much you'd be paying for your macbook of choice anyway...  my question for you mr 2d, is since the MBA is only a great value buy if you get it at the base config (which wont work for me), and the mbp13" feels even less worth it considering its even smaller price gap with the 14"... do you think it would be dumb of me to just get the base 16"? i realize thats a larger financial jump from the specced out MBA, but i wasnt ever going to get the base 14" anyway. if anything i had my eye on the higher end 14" (and no additional upgrades)... but for $200 more i can get a larger screen and way better battery life. i know its kind of a subjective thing to ask, but which would you get? i prefer the size of the 14", having been an owner of the 2019 16", but the battery life seems to be staggeringly better on the 16"... plus, you get a larger display... and not just a larger display, but more of apples own finest display... i guess its a dumb thing to get stuck up on when shopping for a device this expensive... but its really bugging me. just wondering what your thoughts were. thanks in advance.
I like how he casually mentions that he is 40 midst of MBP hype and I'm like wtf bro I thought you would we late 20 or early 30s
I am going to continue using vs code on my 3 year old ROG
YOU ARE FORTY?
The design somewhat looks like the PowerBook Titanium
Tim Cook has smashed another home run.
No way Dave looks 40 wtf
Dam 1st time great apple,love i am going to pre-order this...✨🤩 Heyy wait a second.... Look at here rog strix scar 15.. with ryzen 7 and Rtx 3080 300HZ....... And Many more...... Apple M1 pro 8core + 14core...🙄🙄.....   Asus Rog strix scar 15 finally mine....😁💫🥳 your welcome bro
Whats up with GFXBench 5.0 where 32 core get 308 FPS and 3080 237FPS ?
Glad I got the 14”, that 16” is HUGE. On the topic of money.. There are plenty of work out there that are paying well, go get a job and stop worrying about not having enough to pay for things you want.
I can't believe Apple made a thick device. up until the last second of this video, I was thinking this is some kind of joke but no it's REAL.
40?!
HE IS 40 😯
i like the ending message
Dave you are my favorite <3
1:17 that’s what she said
It doesn't have face id because that is a 2022 MacBook feature. You can not get all the usability at once.
Yeah wtf dave you look like you’re in your late 20’s… and I guess I’ll keep my plain jane m1 for another year or two, still loving almost everything about it (dongles👎)
They finally put the Pro in Pro devices; unless you are rich af and want the best of the best, M1 Air is what you want.
bruhh u 40??? looks like u were just married yesterday   meanwhile 40 dudes: gonna kill this guy !!
I love the intro
That "bloom, what blooom?" part got you the quickest upvote ever.
What do you mean you are 40!?
you’re 40? dude u look 25 wtf
what about CS:GO fps ? curious to see the diffrences on 14 pro vs 16 max... still one of the most played games around the globe.
If you live in the city, you should probably not buy your own sawmill. Even though it rips through a 2 feet wide log in 10 seconds to make beautiful lumber. You don't need lumber and you don't even have logs.
Alwwwwwwways a top notch review
I'm definitely in need of a new laptop, but I'm hoping they reveal something new next year re: Macbook/Macbook Air. I don't need crazy performance and I'm a student so I don't have much $$$ lol.
Dave is 40?!
Last line was 👌
Great review Dave, the only video so far that has actually good content that talks about real experiences with the machine.
oh wow, this rounded design makes them look DATED they looks like macbooks from 5 to 10 years ago when they're closed. everything about them is so un-apple-y. other than the design these are some of the best devices on the planet right now.
I don't mind the thickness but the overall roundness of it and that black keyboard just puts me off
They couldn't give us one USB type A 3.1 port 😔
finally someone giving good advice thanks Dave
“I’m forty”
So glad you covered the stickers. I was really worried no one would mention that
ofcourse there's a party in the comments.
what a shit review
Does parallels emulate x86 well now or does overwatch have a version that works on ARM for windows?
what the hell you're 40!? are you a vampire?
"Everything is good when you go thick"                                                               -Dave2D 2021
I would LOVE to see those benchmarks on batteries not plugged-in to ac power adapter .. I think that’s were MacBooks shines
Damn, you're 40? You look at least 10 years younger
Wassup. Port. Plug it up  ~Dave Lee
i would have watched this video anyways but i got out of bed and am watching it at 12:40am cos my sis messaged me and said you mentioned BTS in your latest video hehe!! I watched that concert too! ARMY here haah! Oh you might appreciate this, in this years BTS In the Soop series (season 2, episode 2), where they go for a relaxing holiday, i paused the screen to see what the members were playing, and they were playing a 2v2 match of Starcraft! eheh
You,re 40?
they are really cool, but they are also the price of a car.  or at least a drivers license
Wait wait wait. Scew everything else, you are 40?!!!
wtf you're 40?!
1:04 1:10 1:53 4:22 he's good at these, I remember the 'those bezels are too thick' from rogphone5 video😅
“So Dave how do you prefer your laptops?” Dave: *already sticking his tongue out* “THICCC!”
Speaker test please…I still don’t trust the speakers to be similar 😩
"I mean I'm 40"  Shut the front door.
you are 40? you hardly look 30 haha
Please do test if the M1pro chip is able to support 3 4K displays natively thank uuu
Craig wasn’t lying about that instant wake from sleep
can't just say I'm 40 and move on FOH
Holy shit, your 40 years old, you look like your in your late 20’s
everything's good when you go thicc HAHAHAH
I had to double take on 4:18. Did he say he's 40? I thought he was 30 at max.
How is parallels/crossover performance on these systems? Parallels is terrible on my intel MBP 16. (I know you mentioned it, but I'd like more details if possible).
Dave's 40 ??!! Onfggh
man i didnt know Dave is 40. he looks like hes in his 20s
I was waiting for the Pixel videos actually
wait what you r 40??
Of all the early reviews, Dave 2D is always the first one to watch for me.
designs when johny ive is not there !
This may be the first time that marques and dave haven't uploaded together
6:58 render error lol
Repairability is the concern 😏
The moment when background music starts playing and you're coming back to the real world
I was not able to kill the temptation, even though I know I don't need this. After watching this video-Now things are okay.
this guy is not in his 20s and its crazy to me
Love your ending comment. Most people would be content with the MacBook Air. $2K starting price is costly.
What a great conclusion. Love it. Thank you Dave.
I will wait for the next with faceid
Dave is 40?????
You're 40?!?! Damn bro, you gotta tell me your secret! >.<
I want to unhear Dave saying "Everything's good when you go thicc"  I miss him being Innocent
so exited even though I  can't afford
The reason there is no FaceID is in fact that the display part injustice way too thin. The thinnest device with FaceID is the 5.9mm iPad Pro. The display part of the MBP is only half as thick.
"Everything's good if you thicc" -Dave2D 2021
WAT, YOU 40 ?, Can't believe it Dave, you more like 30 for me.
Well said, it is just a tool.
- "I'm forty..." - You're WHAT?
Could not agree more with that final point. Surely the current M1 Macbook Air will fit most of the non-pro users, let alone the next generation coming in 2022.
You are 40?😲😲😲
YOU ARE 40!?
WTF YOURE NOT 40
Like bruh the last statement must be taken seriously…creators would totally use or need this but the regular crowd, I don’t think so…
Man. I wish my Xcode builds took less than a minute.
Everyone in the tech community like “Where’s MKBHD?” 😂
damn, suddenly went from tech fanboi to realistic geek at the end in a very wholesome fashion. thanks grandpa 2d
So Apple in their event claimed that their M1 Max could beat super high end CPUs with such insane performance and low wattage (30W). Well, my Ryzen 5 5900HS in my zephyrus G14, limited to 25W (35W boost) can do 14k in cinebench multi core, and almost 1700 single core. That M1 Max is 1500 single, 12k multi. Apple, as usual, creates too much useless hype around their products, which might I add have even less and less upgradability. Fragile, ultra expensive, unrepairable machines. And not that insane performance as they stated.  Edit: Also in GPU power, it's nice, but again nowhere even close to what they said and what every news outlet out there was stating. Everyone was saying it could beat RTX 3080 and RX 6800 lol, sure. It's barely like a 3060, which is already awesome yes, but very far from what everyone and leaks were claiming. And it's macOS only, so that's another thing.
"They are expensive, but they are tools. That's all they are."  Thank you for that simple line which sums up the wants vs needs of average consumers.
wait how tf you ar 40? i was thinking your are about 28 or something. but still I don't believe you that you are 40
Macs are getting too good
Dave pump it up..... 😂
Dave you look 25 max lol
Holy shit dude ur forty? You could pass for 33
lets just call it Fatbook pro
Dave you just can't be 40. That ain't fair.
"Everything is good when you go thick"💯
What? You 40?? 😲😲
That overwatch gameplay was lit!!
I'm like 70% sure he's 25 and is just messing with us
Thicc > thin
was Almost wondering if this is still a macbook we're talking about when I saw the ports...lol
Thanks so much for reassuring my m1 air purchase :)
The notch is unforgivable.
Good advice!
"Everything is good when it's thicc" - Dave Lee
I wish apple made a gaming laptop
What website did he use for the typing test?
Ordered the previous M1 days before and I was thinking whether I have to get this one instead. The last point he said is truly miraculous, decided to keep the 2020 M1.
Best conclusion!!! Probably saved me $1000.
One thing, if your current salary as much as 3k$ for top specs, just go for it, this one means business and will serve you many more years to earn money from it
"everything's good when you go thick"  That's what she said
Dave loves hoodie season, yeah...
Stickers, lol.
you are not 40!!! O.o
I was shocked to see a review this soon. But I was waaaay more shocked when I heard you’re 40. Dude, you look like 12.
Man. Just bought the 2021 Air.... :(
They're tools, that's all they're - Dave2D 2021 The best tech/tools-related advice ever
If only it was repairable and not overpriced otherwise  I'd buy one
great stuff Dave. You look much younger. probably the new studio have some preservation mechanism:)
Damn! You beat Marques by at least 40 minutes. Love it! :)
Leave the macbooks...dave is 40 !?
1:17   "Everything is good when you go thicc"   - Dave, Oct 25th 2021
YOUR 40?????
Short, sweet and to the point! 👏
You can really tell that this is a pro device by the fact that Apple supplies you a charger with this device.
If i could get a base model M1 Pro Mac Mini for $1400 that would be great. All of my storage is on the network so hopefully there will be a 10/25Gbps option
Damn, the XPS's webcam is so bad that id makes Dave face age 10 years!
The M1 pro base 14" is really disappointing. If the M1 air supported more than 1 display I wouldn't even bother considering it. Hell, I hope Apple don't make the Air a toy with white bezels next year. Just add support for 2 displays, add the notch if you have to and I'm good.
you are 40? wtf 🤠😰
Dave playing NF for sound test. ACTUAL POG!
what about the battery? how many hours of netflix/YouTube?
The fuck? You are 40?
"Everything goes good when its Thiccc" - Dave 2021
T H I C C
Bruh no way you're 40. You look like you just got outta college
I wouldnt even be considering one if the macbook air could output to more than 1 display
I9-12900hk is more powerful than m1 max as far as geekbench 5 is confirmed but draw a whole lot of power.
damn dave was on the trigger with that upload, he even beat justine
What if they simply changed the sticker because in the end the computers have black apples regardless? It made sense white when the logo used to light up
wtf,  Dave is 40??
Appreciate the honesty at the end. Hard to find these days.
“Everything is good when you go thicc” -Daddy Dave
hey dave can the m1 max run minecraft?
phaha...Apple won't use a crappy webcam in 2021... Then shows a crappy webcam. Yeah, slighlty better than on XPS13, but still. lmao
Thank you for convincing me not to sell my kidneys for it, Dave. :)
Good conclusion
I thought you were under 30
Did he just say he's 40? Really?
Best review from all the tech blogs
Dave2D =hype killer pro max
The last 2minutes are my favorite. I've always enjoyed your videos because at the end of the day - you're honest, and care more about us than them. Thanks for that last bit Dave. You're Awesome.
MKBHD is late 🤦🏼‍♂️
What the fuck, Dave is 40
Still don’t regret my MacBook Air 512gb/16gb purchase from summer.
Flexing with black apple stickers… 🤦🏻‍♂️
Iam shocked  Are you really 40 year old I thought you were at most 25
we didn't need 1k monitor stand either but hey... thats apple
Dave need to drop the skin care routine
et tu Dave? why are you apologizing for the lack of HDMI 2.1 on a $3k+ laptop in 2021? No man, I can't connect my LG OLED and get 120hz because of this oversight.
I also love THICC but not my laptop (;
Had Del/Hp put a notch on their device these reviewers would have gone mad. When apple does it... Everything is fine. I could have defended the Mac if they had a face id. Someone please explain why a punch hole couldn't be worked out for this ?
@dave2d what's that green bar at 6:57 ?
that's what she said 1:17
waw dave you and your family watching bts concert me tooo😭😭
Dave is single-handedly keeping overwatch alive
what now :/? 40!!! man i thought u were in your 20s or smthn
run blender open data PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Apple: *releases upgraded technology on their devices: Dave: *not impressed*  Apple: *gives away black sticker* Dave: This is the best
Everything is good when you go  "Thick" 😉
Phew, going to keep my M1 MBP and desktop PC.
I thought he was in his early twenties. He doesn't look fourty at all.
Everyone: NEW MACBOOKS PRO! Some: T H I C C is good Me and some: WAIT DAVE IS ALREADY 40
40 yo? more like 27
"Everything's good when you go thicc"  wise man indeed
None of the features are worth the price
what would be a closer alternative to this, coming from more affordable pricing aspect?
This is fake. They don’t release the new Macbook pro until Tuesday, Oct, 26th.
Part of your selling point is you look young
YOU‘RE 40??? 😵
where are real tests and so forth?
meanwhile marques be like : impression , Review, Final thought , final loop and go onnn..maybe this time each video about an hour long
Dave 40? I would give you 35 at most
Comment for support
Do speakers sound the same on both sizes?
I feel like the video was rushed
I love Thickkk...          - Dave2D
The silver looks hot!
You’re 40!!?? Good for you :)
I love thiccness...Sign of reliability...If it doesn't work, you can always hit someone with it... (Snatch, 2000)
Can you do a video comparing the asus zephyrus s17 and the new macbook pro 16 inch? Thanks a lot.
Thicc is good! ahaaa.
4:20 Great impression! 😂
11 hours of battery life with 250 hits at 100Wh battery is not amazing.
39 here
Once you go thicc you never go back - Kanye probably
Hello Dave
"Pros"
Everything's good when you go thicc 🌚
👌👌👌👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌👌👌👌👌👌
4:22 Bloom?😂😂
Even Dave's forehead has a notch on it now
Indeed it’s nice but my M1 Mac is great
Thankyou for explaining about new expensive toy
This is the only video on these macbooks that actually feels like a legit review. The other youtube videos are just basically reiterating everything that was announced last week…
Those GPU benchmarks are very interesting. You can very clearly see which benchmark prefers which parts of a GPU (e.g. RAM bandwidth vs GPU horsepower).
great, now make 'em repairable then Apple literaly makes the perfect laptops
I have to be the only one person in the world that actually likes the touch bar...but the new ones still looks great!
"Everything's good when you go thick"   -Dave2D
Why nobody talk about the USB A? I need it for my wireless mouse :(
<3
Apple fanboy piece of shit, the notch is fucking retarded. Even a fucking phone has better front facing cameras !
I am crying that I really need this mac but don't have enough budget :'(
Dave, this is really good work.   I mean you!  First out.  Best.    And most of all.    Best wishes.
So the table is 🔙
m1 13 is still the best option
leaving the botched sticker slide in just gave you + sympathy points…. aaand the pin-point old man interpretation ++
dave... RTX 3080 performance isn't 10k teraflops as they showed on the graph, even the new xbox has a little bit more, the gpu on the MAX is more like a GTX 2080, and the PRO more like a GTX 1070 MaxQ
What’s bloom?
The intro 😍
Aww man I wanted these for fun but your advice at the end went through my heart like a needle 🥲
"Everything's good when you go thicc" - Dave 2021😫
its got a port, loved it
5:10 dave is a fellow NF fan! Respect
Love the new intro
Man that battery test is heart breaking… thinking about switching to the 16”
Legit debating either a a razer blader 14(3070model) or a macbook pro 14 around the same price speced, and i cant decide really, just gonna be coding, editing and maybe some light gaming.
Mans acting like auto adjust refresh rate on laptop is a new thing. Bruh it's literally been on every ROG laptops since at least 2018
Wait a minute....... Dave is 40!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm getting a feeling the whole comment section will be about Dave being 40 year old and not about MBP...
Why did they remove the utility strip?
"Everything's good when you go thicc"  Dave2D
Dave : I'm 40 Wtf He look's closer to 30
Mans intros 💙
Complete non-Apple user but it is GREAT to see them bringing back legit ports.   Full size SD slots should never have gone away in anything pushed towards creators!
You're... you're 40?!
40???!
Quick question about the keyboard and the all-black block it is ? Might it be that it is easier to remover / replace / change layout ? as in without having to distructively rip it away with pliers?
your setup is looking better than ever
First and only review I care for.  Also, you are 40!!!!!!!!!!!!! Damn you could pass for 20s.
You’re 40? I thought 25. Jesus.
I just want an M1 16'' Macbook Air
That conclusion is perfect: "They're really cool but they're tools, that's all they are"
"Everything is good when you go THICC" yes I agree.
I don't like the fat curvy design at all.
"Every things good when you go T H I C C" 😏
they are just tools to do certain things...u can buy buy those tools at lower prize unless its macbook
Battery life watching an almost completely dark 250 nit video: *11 hrs lower than advertised* Dave: "Battery life is great!" Everybody: ...
this is the review I've been waiting for
dave is 40 thats a newzz
everything's good when you go thick, lol
40 yo look like 33. Review ur self care
Thank you for the brilliant content. Best tech reviewer In The World 👍🙏
The biggest reveal of this review is that Dave is 40 😮
very nice review mate
holy crap, he is 40?! He seems like 25
Dave, do yourself a favor and finally switch from Premiere Virgin to Davinci Chad. Adobe is garbage.
Listen we all know, that THICC = GOOD.
thanks for not doing an informercial review.
The fact that I'm 28 and Dave is 40 and I look a good 10 years older than he does makes me super depressed lmao.
Dave: "--- like, im 40 right---" me: wait what
Hey can i get hoodie link
Dave is 40 Damn
wait.. YOU ARE 40?
Thank you for saving me the money i dont have Dave
mini LED plus the 1080p camera does not fit stacked together thats why there is a notch
...You're FOURTY? Holy shit you look like you're 29,30 wtfff.
"everything's good when you go THICC" ~Dave2D, 2021
1:10 that's what she said
you are 40 ???? what!!
Premiere isn’t even optimized for Apple Silicon yet so it’s putting out those numbers using translation. Insane
I just want to see, if I’ll save battery with promotion off, and how much!!?
“Everything is good when you go thick” - Dave 2D 2021 quote
HE IS 40?!! DAMNNNNNNN
Watching at how these look in real life , I'm even more pissed why they can't just return the glowing apple logo. A P P L E ! (Dankpod nosies)
The notch is like a dark spot on the retina of your screen/eyeball. I can't get over this defect.
Dude please create a buyers guide for it. I am planning to buy on of these but I am confused which one should I opt for, the base 14inch or the base 16inch. Please make a longer video covering those aspects. How much those particular 2 less performance and GPU cores affect and the overall small form factor of 14inch cripple it in any way?
Thanks for your honesty at the end! I ended up going with the M1 MacBook Air. I couldn’t see the benefit for an extra 1K!
"Everything is good when you go thick," I think this goes beyond laptops
Hold the f**k up, did you just say you're 40? I genuinely thought you were in your late 20s. I mean, GGWP I guess, I hope I age as well as you.
dave 2D or Teal 2D ? 😁
They don’t have Face ID and why it would be a very stupid idea to have it on a laptop is payments. When you buy something through Apple Pay on a iPhone, it prompts you to double click the sleep/wake button. This is to ensure that 99.99% of purchases made are genuine and not been made simply because you looked at your phone (I say 99.99% as they may be an instance where someone’s shopping, accidentally taps Apple Pay and for some reason double clicks the sleep/wake button all the while looking at the phone). Now if Face ID we’re on the new MacBooks then what would you double click? And at that point isn’t it easier just to put your finger on a fingerprint reader? Yeah exactly, that’s why they didn’t put Face ID on the new MacBooks.
rip people who still use usb a
TIL Dave2D is 40.....40! Have a like, good sir!
"everything is good when you go thick"😂
HEEEELLLLL YEEAAAAAHH, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FORR WOOOOOOO
So you now like thick laptops that apple makes them? Nice bias, apple sheep.
Fed up of dell XPS intel windows and thermals  Dumping and switching to Apple Mac 16
1:17 that's what she said!!
40??
"Everything is good if you go thicc" - Dave 2021
It probably doesn’t have FaceID because the dot projector only works when you’re a foot away from your device. Laptop users are probably 2-3 feet away so the dots wouldn’t be dense enough to accurately detect faces. That’s my guess
"Every thing is good when you go thicc" --- Dave2D 2021
Dave’s absolute best
Nice last thought to keep me on the ground to not buying these things.
Everything's good when you go THICC 😏
Such a good and efficient review
i love how dave always focuses on saying that tech is a tool  and you need too buy one only if you really need it
Someone tell me please how is this man 40 yrs old 🤔😂
Damn Dave, you're 40??
"Everything's better when you go thicc" - Dave2D 2021
i would love a new rainbow apple sticker
shit man you 40?? I thought you're 29.
Love Dave2D's honest take at the end. Always a straight shooter...also...40? or was that 14? I swear I always thought you were 35 or so.
just bought the 16 inch one, I feel amazing to program in this, it compiles big programs that use ML in just some seconds. If anyone wants to do ML you will love this laptop.
"They are really good, but they are tools, that's all they are"
those last 30 seconds determined my buying decision. Just gonna wait for the upgraded m2 air next year.
hdnsghsnajdb What!!!?!??!!? This dude is 40?
Love Johnny Ive’s voice, but apple is better off without him. I’m convinced this is the first product that has not been influenced by him
Some rich college students be rocking these to do powerpoints. 😏
Idk if that notch is a Dumb or a Pro Gamer Move
Dave is 40? 🤐🤐
You cannot convince me that you're 40. You don't even look 30 in my opinion. Great review anyway👍
Each one modelos of macbook pros should be cost around 500$ less then the atual price, and reserve the m1 pro for 14' and the m1 max for 16' size, and the reasons, i really dosent need to talk, everyone knows
What's the snake-game like game being played at 4:50?
If the mac could game like a windows microsoft would be out of buisness real soon.
They're really cool, but they're tools...well said
"Everything is good when you go T H I C C" I see you're a man of culture Dave
U r the only one who mentions ARGB%on a mac... and i love that...
Apple is undoing its mistakes lol
Who was waiting for this and who hit the like button before watching?
I just love the intro Mann!!!❤️
I think you guys have super power against aging. I am 26 and I look older than you.
“They are really cool but they are tools” Thank you you just saved me $2000.
DAVE IS *40???*
5:19 🥱
as thicc as they get, i wish my bank acc would be thicc as i want them to be.
omg I'm so happy dave got the macbooks early, good choice apple
Those final words, awesome! Great video as usual
I was waiting for this.Thank you for the first review I am having option of razer book 13 or MacBook pro 14
Everything good when you go thick now my favourite line
Dave is 40 !!!!!!
dave is 40 woah he looks like 20
Damn I'm 29 and I look older than you! Good on you man, and good review. I just got a M1 MacBook Air because of your review!
40? Dave, no way dude. LOL😂
I...have beeeeen waiting for this video. Beeeeen waiting.
woah seeing it for the first time
Thanks for being honest Dave.
I thought you are in mid 30s but you are surprisingly old.😂
nice intro haha
Sorry what? 40? I follow your videos since years and I honestly thought you’re in your late 20s
@8:16 The Dave from 2012 wouldn’t say this. Yes man, u are ageing & yes these are words of wisdom ❤️❤️. Awesome review, as always!!  P.S. I like this 40 year old Dave better ✌️
Am I the only one or anybody else think he sound stupid when he is bragging about HDMi port, I mean I never used any mac previously thus I find it hilarious.
Dave: I'm 40 Me: What?
What Dave is 40 cmon man you must be joking
Thanks My Fellow Torontonian For this awesome review was not expecting it so soon!  You rock Dave! Have a awesome day full of Love and Light! 🙏❤️
Dave in the 40 club? 🤔 Asian don’t raisin!
Am i the only one who likes the notch?
Man, u r the best!!
Well, that was disappointing. Looks like all of Apple's hype was the usual hogwash. Not even the battery life is close, and I was definitely expecting at least 3070 graphics perf, but it's around 3060 which isn't bad for an integrated chip but definitely not worth the cost. Overall, it looks like Dave's conclusion of Apple app users being the biggest beneficiaries and no one else is probably the correct assessment.  I actually thought game developers might start considering metal games if the GPU perf was insane but no way that's going to happen with these chips at least. All in all, doesn't seem like it's worth getting these tho I'm still interested in xcode perf gains.  Also I don't mind the thickness but the design sucks for me, way too boxy and ugly.
oh damn i wouldnt have ever thought, that he is 40 years old. 😯
MACBOOK APPLE UHMM YEAH HOL UP, DID YOU JUST SAY YOU'RE FORTY?
""Everything is good when you go thick."'                                             -dave(2021)
I love how a bunch of other you tubers just come and comment
40?
No one but dve2dd is the onw stop for lappy lovers...
Me - Dave is around 26  Dave I'm 40  Me 😮
I just saw NF haha
Your comment about Adobe is all I needed to hear.  Maybe I won't spring for the top of the line since most of my work is done in Adobe products.
Blackmagicfuckery
I like macbooks as I like woman thicc
Looks like razor. 😀
this guy is just awesome..always loved his video...he doesn't waste a second, straight to the point with most information about the product within his time frame .
40!? i need to know every thing you do 📝
haha 68k score is the 32 core variant. The copium apple shills were insisting its 24 cores and the 32core would score 80k+.
Why the rush??
Life coach vibes toward the end 8:20
He's 40? Wtf. Hahahaha
Dave saying hes 40 but looking 25?!  Also LOVE the NF feature here
6:59 I dropped my phone and almost had an heart attack xD
did you speed up the video? i have to check twice if i did it but i didnt. you talk fast.
When seeing how Nvidia and others are getting better performance by pumping power into their chips, Apple is miles ahead then it even looks. Once they take their chips that route (desktop power and thermal headroom) I think windows and others are in for trouble. Apple has so much room to stretch in both the laptop space and desktop with this new chip design.
I love that he listened to The Search from NF😍😅😂
The battery life they claimed seemed questionable to me. Having a 140 Watt charger (clearly shows bumped up power usage) + the size of the chip they used (not to mention the 4x gpu) + doubling the amount of performance cores compared to M1 just didn't add up to 21 hours.
Always in fond of Dave final words- it just a tool~~
BEST TECH YOUTUBER
Bts concert eh? 😏
Thank you Dave for such an honest review,especially the part at the end. Yes they are amazing machines but you will not have anything to do in them unless you're a professional or something. You'll be really disappointed with you purchase decision after the new laptop excitement wears off and you find out that there's nothing to do in it except watch videos. I regretted buying the M1 Macbook because I got excited and now I regret it,don't make the same mistake.
MY BOI DAVE'S 40??? WTH?
I disliked the design. More ports are good but, in this case the ports are not placed so nice. And this is so fat. I didn’t expected this design
4:22 Bloom what bloom i don't see anything.....!?
I like the way Dave says, they are really cool but they are tools. This is the reality of this world.
Imagine me having to get a steamdeck, painting it to teal and installing 3ds max and zbrush on it xD , portable workstation bro.
Did he say 14 or 40?
1:16 "everything is good when you go thicc"
The ending line, it really drove a point through "They are really cool, but they are tools, that's all they are"🙏   Changed my mind of going for the best vs what is the best tool for the job at hand.
The fact that you're 40 is insane to me. Would've always guessed late 20s or early 30s. Black magic
They are even better than I thought last week after the pres.
I bought 14 inch m1 max. Hope that the cooling is still good
Hold the fuçk up ........ You're 40 😳😳
Grandpa Dave: "Bloom? What bloom? I don't see anything kids..."
You're 40? You look younger than me (28)
"They r really cool but they r tool " best line I ever hear 🔥🔥
Your intro makes me wanna play minecraft
Wow, you and Mathew posted videos at exact same time !
Bro how tf are you 40 you look 30 at most
Honestly, the image quality of the xps webcam seems perfectly fine to me for a webcam but as long as the webcam notch doesn't cut out movies, I don't care that they did it.  I wish Apple supported more games and engineering software without needing to install Windows.
I hate you Dave so much for making me think my brand spanking new monitor was broken at 6:58 🤣
Finally apple came with the most awaited 14 inch mac 🔥
Pro Black sticker -> Apple bullshit
I refuse to believe that Dave's 40
You are amazing Dave
"Everything is good when you go thiccc"  -Dave, 2021. A true man of culture.
Your grandpa imitation totally cracked me up! 😂
« Everything is good when u go thicc »  Dave knows wassup
How can you play Overwatch on the M1 MacBook Pro?
I just want a macbook with a large screen. Should I go for this or the last gen?
Decision made. Thanks Dave.👍
It's more important than my office meeting
Dave approved ordering shortly…
"Everythings good when you go thick" - Dave2D
I will say on my M1 iPad pro I notice the bloom when I'm in a darker room it's very noticeable and honestly annoying
Petition for Dave to make a video in grandpa voice✊
“They’re tools, that’s all they are.”  Somehow this helped me a lot on the buying decision thanks Dave.
Did he just say he's 40 !!! 😳 He looks 25 to my eyes.
Those babies got back, Sir-Dave2D.
if this youtube thing doesn't work for you, try voice acting grandpa characters
40?! I thought we were the same age (I'm 30)
Man I sorta prefer the design on the regular M1 MacBooks but that's just me.
Asus G15 with 3080+ 24gb ram is 2900 usd. M1 max 32 core  32gb ram is 3500 usd. and G16 is faster with 600 usd less
I can’t believe he's 40 wtf
At the end, it felt like Dave was talking to me specifically 🙈
So excited to hear your review although I’m getting next year’s Mac book air not the pros!
Which monitor is behind you? By the way love your reviews....
how is dave 40, he feels and talks like 20+
6:57 I think there’s a problem here (still a great video)
I THINK MAC BOOK AIR IS STILL GOOD FOR LOT BUT BETTER UPGRADE RAM!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait, you're 40? I thought you're in your 20s!
He is 40 still looks like 18!!
You are not 40 ! you look 30 at max !
I wish I look this good when I’m 40
What about GPU benefits between M1 Pro 8-Core vs. M1?
Wait. You are 40? O.O
Wow those performance numbers are shockingly disappointing to me...  I knew it was too good to be true when they didn’t include hdmi 2.1. Apple knew it wouldn’t be able to drive it so why even bother to include 2.1
Dave...you are 40 ? .....wow you look much younger ,or is that you have a really great editor 😀.  I'm 54..... so yeah ummm That's depressing.
Chill Dave, Apple has always had record terrible webcams in all their Macs. Making this webcam 1080p now is not anything new
He is 40 ? Wtf man he looks 28, maybe 30 max.
This is looking like MacBooks could now be a legitimate replacement for traditional Windows gaming laptops...  What an insane MacBook transformation Apple has accomplished in the last 12 months.
hey..... that's the Teal small PC on the table behind you Dave.... :)
The XPS webcam looks fine honestly! You only use it for video calls anyway
"Bloom?! What bloom!"  Nearly spit out my breakfast
Oh wow they're CHUNKY chunky
I was expecting an Adobe Premiere extreme boost performance, sadly it wasn't. *cue sad music
Woow how is this possible bro 40 you are not more than 30 srly
Day 12 of asking Dave to make an intro of Zoro getting lost and ending up in his intro...
Everything is good when you go thick 😜
Thank you for not being an apple fanboy .
I personally don’t like the square design and it’s so damn thick lol… Imma just keep my 2018 pro  Bruh he’s 40?…. No way
The advice in the last. My man ❤️
this guy 40??? lol
is Dave2D really 40? boomer
Ummm, DAVE IS 40?! WTF! I thought 30 tops. God damn.
I love the more squared look.
Thicc is goood. Reliable reviews as always!!!
Why Apple managed to fit the 1080p webcam for iPad Pro?
is it just me or the chassis looks like a razer blade ?
Finally someone gets the point of the HDMI port. It's when you're in a conference room and you want to share a presentation or screen share for a short period of time. I don't think you would avoid a thunderbolt dock/display with this MacBook Pro and that's not a bad thing.
“Bloom? Isn’t that the newspaper guy from whateverburg?”
Thought he was like 26
I didn’t even noticed dave is 40….
You're 40?! I feel old.
"They are tools, that's what they are"
you dont look 40. You look 30 not 40
For 1500$ these MacBooks would've sold like cupcakes, but they had to make them expensive
This is one of those videos that I clicked on immediately
THICC Macbooks are back! Woo, like the OG Macbook Pros
So why don't they work great for Adobe premier ? And will it work better later ?
Dave likes it Teal and Thicc
I really wish they would've just put in 1 regular usb port.
Everything is good when u go thicc , "Dave 2D 2021"
This is a MacBook generation for the ages
Ya these devices is not needed for everyone.
Plz compare these new apples to the 2020 razer advance
I was waiting for this review since forever
This dude is 40 years old wtf lol!  ddnt expect tht
I am gonna be honest, seeing that it wasn't as good as 3080 it was weird . I was afraid like you said in your previous video , of the fact that whole perception of the graphics scene would change . It was a kind of relief that it wasn't able to match 3080 .   However I kinda was hoping that what the numbers indicated would be true cuz that would have been really interesting and would shake up the market .   Still that kind of performance for that kind of efficiency is crazy good nonetheless
I was waiting all the year for this MacBooks but a month ago I buy the MacBook Pro m1 because I couldn’t wait more, is the best decision I made, is cheaper and makes everything I want to do
3:34 so smooth and no power connected??
The only thing missing is a glowing Apple logo
I love your Reviews
Love and respect from Pakistan 💛🇵🇰
It’s just… really want to like this but I can’t STAND that MacBook keyboard. Why does it have to be so crap??
The more realistic and important part of the video was the end.
So true Dave - they are Tools for Video Editors, etc. I watched the event and it dawned on me, I don't need the M1X pro let alone Max. I hated the fans spinning up when I watched 4K videos or playing a game like Football Manager with temps over 70 deg on Intel versions. So, I sold my Intel MB 2015 15 inch for 500 and bought a used like new M1 Mac Mini for 570 and a 32 inch 2k Viewsonic Monitor also used like new for 200. Already had a keychron and mx master. Honestly it is a huge jump up from the 6 year old MB Pro and I barely spent anything. Lovely stuff.
I don't know why I get so shocked every time I hear Dave mention his age, but I still do every time. Talk about aging gracefully.
8:20 "They're really cool, but they are tools. That's all they are."
Guess apple's back in form. Too bad I'm broke
I love what Dave told at last. "These are tools"
Very nice, but if the price is not there, it's kind of DOA
1:17 "Everything is good when you go thick"  ~ Dave 2021
You are fast bro!
what the fuck, you are 40??? you look so young!
You're 40???   Forget the Macs, that's the breaking news in this video!
There's no excuse for including a HDMI 2.0 port instead of 2.1, specially as this is a pro-grade equipment that costs up to 5 thousand USD. Professionals often use high resolution displays with high refresh rates, and being bandwidth limited because of Apple wanting to save a few bucks sucks, specially with a GPU as good as this.
first one to review the new macbook pros! (in my feed)
1:35 the answer we've been waiting for
„They are really cool but they are tools thats all they are“ - Dave. What a great quote right at the end. So true aswell!
Microsoft needs to work with Apple towards a boot camp solution.
"I was hoping that this would be a render MACHINE. I thought it would just CRUSH them. It doesn't; which is kinda good, because now I don't have to pay $5,000 for a new laptop. THANK GOD." Never change Dave. Please.
Your 40?! Damn thought u were like 32
BEAUTIFUL
WHY DO THEY LOOK SO BOXY AND UGLY OH MY GOD
awesome job!
Forty. Ah that Asian young look gene we get to enjoy.
Dave saying that he's 40 made me more surprised than any performance the MacBook Pro could put out.
I don't know what's more shocking tbh. The performance on these things, or that you're 40. You look 35 at best!
Dave is 40 💥🤯 Happy 40 years on earth man ❤️
Hold up hold up hold up DAVE IS 40?!  My man doesn’t look it for sure
Everything's good when you go thicc. -Dave '21
hows everyones rainy toronto morning everyone?
Thanks for reminding me that I am poor. Almost spent my life savings on this
“Bloom, what bloom?” -Herbert (from his basement)
At the end he meant these are professional tools, not an entertainment device.
Zephyrus g14 but with worse ports for double the money. Most Apple devices ever.
1:16 everything's good when you go thicc- lord dave 21st century
The real reason for not having faceid is that they need a feature for next year.
I’m getting one so my wife can watch BTS too!
"I was hoping that this will be like a render machine" 6:57 how ironic
No one talks about the real upgrade :  The arrow keys are back to normal.
Dave 2D speaking in an old man's voice seriously is so hilarious, it had me laughing so hard LOL.
what Dave2D is 40?
4:22 😂😂bloom what bloom? 🤣
Thanks for the insight I’ll skip these laptops and stick with my old 2017 MacBook Pro
Face Id may not work at the distance many people use their MacBooks.
How he get them so quick?
Always the first one.. hehehehe.. nice one dave
Sooo we are not going to talk about Dave being 40?
POG
Omg black Apple stickers, so innovative.
He never loses his touch ❤️
Nice
Really love the advice at the end. For average users macbook air m1 still a great choice.
How does the Dell XPS 15" or HP Envy/Spectre speakers fair against the new MBP?
*everything is good when you go thicc*
Confirmed: Boomers can't see bloom 👴
Awesome video!!! 🔹🔷
I’ve never clicked a video so fast in my life
Was eagerly waiting for this
Damnn , his French accent is Sweet.
Say goodbye to gaming on a mac memes now

"Everythings good when you go thick" - Dave
Okay apart from all the tech stuff, the fact that threw me the most is that your forty? What? You don't look it, dude. Apart from that, awesome video, as always!👍
My man is 40 and looking better than most 20s
You saw the permission to dance concert?
I wish my wallet was "thick".
HE IS 40???
U are 40???
I never been so ealry!!
Is it me but how is Dave 40?!
Doctor: old Dave can't hurt you, he isn't real. Old dave: 4:17
So apple should now release iMac thick 2021
The most shocking revelation from this review... Dave is 40!
Stop it Dave, now I want that hoodie. What's the colour called?
I don't know who needed to hear this, but dave said it right, don't fall for the hype buy only if you need it, they're tools!!🤙🏻
The best anti hype review I’ve seen. Thanks Dave
You’re 40? Wtf
Dave is 40!?
Dave over here not looking a day over 25
you are the first and best  though i dont have MONEY to buyit now but i knew you are gonna put video first  LOVE FROM INDIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So was the 12 inch MacBook “no extra name” a PROFESSIONAL device since it came with black stickers if you got the black one? 🤔
Wait I though Dave is like 25-28
No way you're 40 though
Dave do you recommend apple macs for school?
Uhh I thought u were like 25 😯
I can sense Dave's excitement for the MacBook Pros all the way here. 😆
Man if you're in your forties I'm a 90 year old grandma
Dude you're 40 ??? You look like you're 30 !
I'm so glad they got rid of that stupid touchbar. It was useless and was just there for show.
Dave I love you! 🥰
The fact he says he is 40 is so hard to believe
no amoled. apple sucks
Early for the first time!
6:58 Seems like some editing glitch there, Dave.
wait a sec dave is 40 !!! damn man did not expect that
40😱
I wonder if FFXIV could hit 60FPS with maximum settings on Macbook now.
“Everything’s good when you go thiccc” Quote of the year and applicable in many many aspects of life.
40? You look like 25 bruh. :D
When Dave said he is forty, i spiled my coffee because i always thought Dave was 33 or 29. Between those ranges
Not first anymore but when I Clicked there was no comment so...first in another timeline maybe???
Wait, he's 40? 😅
Woooo black Apple stickers!!! 😆
How the fuck are you FORTY?? I thought you were in your early 20s!!!
Dang you’re 40!? I thought you were like 22. #AsianDontRaisin
Sir can you test the tensorflow-gpu versions and their performance please?
Every time you remind us of your age my mind gets blown.. again 😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This guy is 40, OMG, I use to think you're like 30.
What you're 40! You look like 27 years old. Damn bro.
Quick asf 🔥
4:24 Grandpa Dave on the money!
Wtf Dave you are 40 years old? I'm younger than you and yet you look better..I look like sh*t
You are what??? 40??? NO WAY man!
Yes! I was planning to buy iPad for coach surfing, now I don't know!
This is a laptop designed by enthusiastic pros for enthusiastic pros!
6 m ?  Never come this fast xd
I can't wait for Dave to grow old so all his reviews will be in his grumpy-old-man voice 🖤
Wait, Dave's age is 40 dafaq
Can this laptop ruN Microsoft word?
Wait so you don't include charger to avoid waste yet put plastic stickers 🤠
"everything good when you go thick" ~Dave2D
Sold! Thanks for the coverage 👍🏽
love your videos from dubai
Every time this man says he’s 40 I don’t believe him I call BS
s it worth th eprice tag? estimated life until the next one comes along?
The moment you realised you can only get the M1 max series models when the "M10 Pro max" series are released xD
Damn Dave’s grandpa voice is on point!!
Dave is 40???????? 🥲 Didn't need to know this.
LMFAOOO WHEN U SAID THAT THE FAM WAS WATCHING THE BTS CONCERT THE DISSAPOINTMENT IN UR EYES LMFAOOO😭😭😭
Your 40, God what do you eat to look 20
Tbh  webcams haven't even been 1080 until very recently lol

The most shocking thing in this video is that he is 40 but looks like he’s 20!!
Love the intro🥳🥳
1:14 the tiny dent or scratch...... my OCD!!!!!!!!
Dave flexing his 30s look when he's 40
When you're so early that it's only available in 480p 😂
BLOOM? WHAT BLOOM I DONT SEE IT
What?? 40 I always think you are in 20s.
You are 40!!!!!!!!!!!🤯🤯🤯
I think the biggest takeaway from this video is that Dave is 40 years old
Can we game on them?

"Every thing is good when you go thicccc," Thats what she said
Wow, you are very sincere person. Right on time
never clicked a thumbnail faster in my life
He is 40?!?
That hoodie. I need that hoodie
I want a whole video done in the "old man bloom" voice
Everything is good when you go thicc
YOU'RE 40??!
Everything’s good when you go thick😏😏😏
Too bad the GPUs are essentially useless for me. I’d be totally on board. Until the gaming industry goes Mac I’ll have no use for this.
can you tell what is the width of nuch? and please can you the dimensions of palm rest area of 14 inch model tnx
It might have more power than a 3080 but I'm still pretty sure you won't be able to game on it.
"Everything is good when you go thick" My thick ladies, where y'all at?
i need 14” base model review please, my use case is for ui/ux, and other creative works in general
I'm an aspiring Apple dev. Sadly I didn't had any apple products in my life because I don't have money to buy any. But I'll do my best to achieve my dreams.
Whatttt Again...Jon was right abt embargo lift up
Never going to buy it, will envy people who's going to have this.
"everything is good when you go thicc" Dave2D 🤣👍
Nice!!
"Everything is good when you go thicc"  Dave2D
They look like windows laptops now. Like the Zephyrus G14 and G15
It's two folds: 1. Apple could have gone with a teardrop design instead of a notch, but next year when they do add FaceID, they don't want to move to a notch then. Plus this way, they can shrink the notch from the year they introduce FaceID. 2. Consistent Design Language: The notch has become synonymous with iPhones. You would not mistake it for any other phone in 2021. They want that same unmistakable identity with the Macbooks vs any other laptop.
I just want likes ._.
W🤯W
"Everything's good when you go thick!"  Dave2D So true. Words to live by!
