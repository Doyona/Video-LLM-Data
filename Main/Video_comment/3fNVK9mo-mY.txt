Unpopular opinion but I liked the Wentz lead offense. Mad we let go of Hines too smh Colts front office be tripping
colts did wentz dirty. shoulda resigned hime
Again, I know I'm 2 years behind but who is in charge of the editing?  Cutting the Cardinals FG before the ball is even snapped?  Some real amateurish editing in 2021.  I hope as I get into 2022 it gets better.
I'm happy for all you colts fans but people on here saying the colts could beat the Bengals and the chiefs are out there minds that definitely wouldn't happen and the Bengals are definitely the hottest team in the league right now
what's up with all the fga's from way far out 🤣
Colts have a chance next time is the RAIDERS
The colts are gonna be a problem in this upcoming season
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrHs-CML4KM <---------------------- Two minutes with awesome facts about NFL! 👀🏃‍♂
kyler murray keeps throwin check downs when he is supposed to be winning the game lmaoooo
Let’s get this done
Ah, the LAST win of the season. How nice to come back and see what we could have been lol. Wentz's last win as a Colt.
@4:35 See where Kyler Murray's end zone flip bad habit struck again in that  playoff loss to the Rams?
4:30
it was nice to see a good game on christmas
why can’t we have this carson wentz all the time?
Some of this comment section didn't age well at all, boy let me tell ya
3:37 😬 Rb got steped on
1:57 Kyle Murray’s speed is incredible
14 For the gate is narrow and (A)the way is hard that leads to life, and (B)those who find it are few.
Luke 11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.  1 Corinthians 14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  1 Corinthians 14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  Matthew 26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  KJV
The eagles are looking really bad right now. Wentz has it goin
Cowboys will feast on you  If you think that little little man Murray is going to take you the promise land is laughable
Colts lucky the cardinals kicker missed 3 field goals that was about 7 points
Johnathan Taylor uses th force on that guy in their opening drive lol
Always keep God first
God bless you guys
God bless you
I was watching Hard Knocks and I noticed something ,sorry Colt fans Carson Wentz is a straight up dork. He's funny not in like a good sense of humor ,just a big time dork just the way he carries himself nerd dork.
think the colts need to get their studs checked out. looked like they were running in place
Cardinals kicker missed two field goals and extra point that would have won the game.
When you have Quenton nelson you can expect the defense to suffer making plays
I see a big game for CD Lamb and Tony P. This week…as well as our special teams
That thumbnail...🥴
Missed field goals hurt.
This game took a few years off my life, but it was great to see my Colts win on Christmas.
They both look sub-par at best both teams, y’all buck up bout this win both these’ teams Regular 😆😝😆
This team is exactly what wentz needed
I lived in AZ for 13 years. The cards have been a joke that entire time. Fans think that they are going to win the super bowl every year, they need help.
Good job guys.. Colts all the way💪
Wentz has tested positive for Covid and because he was not vaccinated it's a 10 day minimum.. Dumb Ass.. Now he is out for Sundays game.. Maybe the GM still has Phillip Rivers phone number...
Got to finally see the Colts play live it was Awesome
Az kicker could have changed this game.
Murray has booster jets on those cleats of his i swear he was moving so fast😂😂⚡️
Love how impressed Kurt was with cardinals quick strike ability but barely mentioned the cardinals getting whooped by the colts 2nd and 3rd stringers.
How tf do my Colts do this. I thought we were doomed at the beginning of the season
Kyler Murrays speed and acceleration is unreal
Wentz honestly reminds me of Tom Brady, he plays to win games. Not really outstanding throws all the time, but he does make great plays to move the chains just like Brady
Don't think i've seen so many missed field goals and pat attempts in an NFL season by alot of teams
I love their all red uniform honestly that's a keeper
I feel like Arizona was contaminated with new players throughout the season, maybe if they kept their chemistry and dynamic their season would've looked more like the Panthers of 2015
Cardinals = 🗑
Wat a game!  Very entertaining
Those last 3 throws by Carson Wentz were probably 3 of his best all season. The pass to Hilton and Patton, where at minimum in his Top 10 throws of 2021
WOw, i was wrong, i have to give it up to Wentz, thought he was junk here in this game but like Tom Rossi said, what a throw, what a play there to seal the game in the later stages of the 4th Q.  Can't remember who he threw it to but it wasn't Pittman, it was #10.  Again, give credit where credit is due.  Will Wentz do that again?  He may not get the chance to because he will be in Covid protocol soon, he isn't vacinnated and of course, it's only a matter of when, not if.  Good luck to the Colts trying to win one of their last two games with Erlinger or trying to win a playoff game with Ehrlinger.  I'd say it's game over.
Cardinals need more depth. Certain injuries are destroying our units: d-hop gone, receivers are underperforming, lose rodney hudson the line is underperforming, lose jj watt we can't stop the run anymore :(
Did anyone else peep isaiah simmons running down JT 👀👀
Get rondale moore back in the gameplan
Cards coulda won if they didn't miss all this Field goals.
Anyone else hate how you always see that first comment telling you what happens before you even start watching the replay
What’s the purpose of a screen play only to run pass the blockers
They do bring it. They are bringing it. They brought it!!!!!
Y'all just love to spoil games in the thumbnails. Literally have the Cardinal player sucking the colts players crotch.. gosh I wonder who won???
Colts are hot right now...exactly what you need going in the playoffs...could do some damage
30-12 loss at Detroit showed the league the Cardinal's true colors....fecal green and brown. Not an elite team here.
Great thumbnail 🤣
im looking forward to the colts in the playoffs
3:17 why are we watching 2nd and 6?
3rd and goal and they go for a field goal?!  Who is the coach?!  That is a bad call.
Congrats Colts! It's unfortunate Cardinals lost all there marbles and mojo. I hope the oldskool Cardinals haunt "Cardinals Suck" doesn't come back!!
The thumbnail is incredible
Don't deserve to be  in playoffs
How can Kyler automatically fumble the ball Jared Goff didn't even do that.
“Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.” ‭‭1 John‬ ‭4:11‬ ‭KJV‬‬
Cardinals defense came to play they offense be tripping Kyle need help he going to be there downfall
Jonathan Taylor is ridiculous. absolutely ridiculous
Colts take advantage of Cardinals miss field goal kick and extra point miss.
If wentz can be a good quarterback, the colts will be even better
i know this is a different video but just an fyi for those who didnt know, cowboys absolutely crushed WA yesterday
The colts played well, but we can all agree if Mat Prater made those kicks the cardinals take the win.
kingsbury should be fired.. he wasn't very good in college, now look at him. they need a topflight corner, and  every down back. kyler is simply to damn small, he can't see certain things, and it shows. this team will not do what they need to help him. should have gotten, 2 guards and center, no more than 6'3, wide bodies at 330lbs, that can't hold up the run, and kyler can always see over the middle, that way he sees the x, and z deep or short over the middle. offence should go through, ERTZ, he is the hard matchup, for backers, then run moore, over the middle, and deep. get rid of kirk, and andy, as one can't get on the field, and the other.. is just soft, too soft, Nkeal harry soft... anyone agree?
Jonathan Taylor is rly big on the colts but it was a good game they played hard
What a thumbnail.
Kyler is still goated
I knew the colts would be a dangerous team ..they are balance the got good D and a qb.. they the team that can beat any team if they get hot come playoff time..probably not KC but all the other teams in the AFC is beatable
I'm just here for some refreshing QB play.
If the colts just handed the ball of to JT from the start of the season we’d have two extra wins
Thumbnail I hilarious 😂.  Pittman t bagging a card player
Why was this the thumbnail?
5:35 is no one talking about that awful PI call?
Cardnals are on a slump.
Happy to see Zach and Carson being key pieces
The federal reserve is owned by the bank of England and the queen of England robs us blind. We need to stop them.
Jonathan Taylor of the Colts is the best running back in the league.  This guy is a beast and NEVER stops moving his legs.
1:57 Short man speed.
Ya they have

0:48 Laces out, Dan!!
This game took a few years off my life, but it was great to see my Colts win on Christmas.
NFL should fire reffs. They are trash. Need to get some new people in there.
2:36 classic wentz
Whoever's doing these highlights needs to be fired.
staged games just like wrestling
Almost entire offense line out for the colts and they still won
colts 8-2 in last ten, chiefs 8-0 since last loss, patriots 7-3 in last ten however lost their last two games.. those teams (afc) turned their seasons around this year.
10:05 holding Chandler Jones, but they don't want to call back to back penalties
Nice to see my Colts get all these primetime W's. They've earned more primetime games next season.
Again, you got a QB that likes to run on his own...Looser 🤣🤣🤣
I'm proud of Carson Wentz he becoming a star be for our eyes.
Go COLTS DON'T NO TEAM WANTS TO FACE COLTS.
Cardinals for the most part played well against Johnathan Taylor
Beginning to believe Carson Palmer's comments on Kyler Murray
Number 30 on the Colts defence, he can play for my team TWICE on Sunday! There’s NO QUIT in that Dude, WOW!
Warning Warning ⚠️⚠️⚠️ the Arizona anual season collapse is among us!!! Thanks for the division lead colts
Who knew Carson Wentz was a premiere Quarterback. I haven't followed the colts this year bit the guy seems like he is on a mission, making up for all that time he was injured. Definitely the better QB. The Cardinals have a "check underneath, run the ball" QB as I see it. Those type of QBs never win superbowls but give decent teams a tough battle. Seems like a reoccurring theme
Good job Colts
Matthew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  Proverbs 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.  Proverbs 7:27 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  KJV
I wish the colts still had Andrew Luck 💯💯
Am I the only smart person that lives in Cincinnati that’s a Colts Fan? Indy is only 2 hours away hell people from other regions drive that to Colts games. Bengals Fans need to give up. They will never win a Super Bowl let alone a playoff game. Indianapolis has a better stadium and a better organization.
I just feel the Colts chemistry together this year is something special! 🏁🩸proud of #16 Ashton Dulin! Keep working King yeeeee 🤙🏽
Despite the loss, Cardinals are in the playoffs!
Good news is, Cardinals still made the playoffs.
After a 1-4 start to the season these colts are truly impressive 👏.  It's that team every1 is afraid to face in the playoffs
Murray's like lighting!
Thank you Indie!  Love, a Rams fan
I love to see Carson Wentz like this, wow💪🏼
The fact that some.of yaw think Murray shouldn't be in the pro bowl...
Go get real qb ur murry ain't last long use skinny leg just like Michael vick.
colts were on point man sheesh
Cards would of won if the kicker made literally any wow
Its funny how the thumbnail is wilson getting a face full of balls lmao
<----- Cardinals fan hanging his head in disgust BUT, (full disclosure I've always loved the tenacity Wentz has shown with his career. I love the guy)... The Colts are a remarkable team that was labeled dead after a horrible start and has since quietly climbed back to the point of a wildcard berth and possibly a division title. My Cardinals will be lucky to make the playoffs so I wish Wentz and the Colts a remarkable run in the postseason.
Colts nfls best
Crazy how the colts still get hate yet still beat a 10-4 team without a starting offensive line and a good portion of our defensive out. I can't even imagine what the score would be if we had our key players. Colts are a very underrated team and as long as we can propel into the playoffs with healthy plays and carson making good decisions I think we can be SB contenders or atleast conference contenders.  And before I get hate, every game we lost was due to carson basically and our secondary being injured. We'd easily be a 12-3 team right now.
Those were some monumentally boneheaded plays by Kingsbury towards the end.
Nice to see my Colts get all these primetime W's. They've earned more primetime games next season.
idc what you say Johnathan Taylor still overrated
Arizona misses Bruce Arians as the Cardinals head coach 😒  I don't know about this Kliff Dingleberrie guy....
All this ish rigged, betting is involved, its rigged.
The Colts have poured it on lately. They making a run for it.
Number 20 on his hands and knees blowing the colts.
Anyways, we're in the playoffs!!! Go Cards, 12-5 record here we come!
Another running QB first gets injured like they all do, then can't WIN with their arm. All to familiar.
Wow the Rams are leading the division now, I thought for sure the Rams had no chance of winning the division this season after losing 3 straight games and dropping to 7-4 while the Arizona Cardinals were like 10-1 at the time and had beaten the Rams in the first game pretty handedly.
Sad to say but as long as the Bidwells own the Cards they will never be a true contender!
ALL POR SPORTS ARE AS FAKE AS WWE...  If you believe that pro sports are real, you're an idiot.
Great Xmas 🏆coltsnation
God were trash but still made the playoffs lol
Bruh the TE #81 at 8:28 is funny bruh😂😂 he was running so slow I thought the WiFi was lagging 😂😂roftl
If the NFL gives Taylor the MVP then we will all know for a fact that the NFL is Rigged and they conspired against King Henry for the MVP & Rushing title 🤦🏾‍♂️
Field goal kicker single-handedly lost that one for the Cards. He left 7 points off the board which would’ve been enough for a one point win.
Not a fan of either team....well played Colts
Damn proud of this team
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
With the Rams win today the Cardinals fate of a playoff berth was decided by another team, not them. How embarrassing. If they lose out the rest of the season Kliff has got to go. It doesn't matter how you start the season, it's how you finish. Teams play much tougher down the stretch and it's clear the Cardinals can't keep up.
Sus thumbnail
GOOD GAME 👍 #NewGenerationBullies
Boy, the Cardinals really suck. I guess the running and gunning QB is not the answer...haha!!!
The thumbnail 🤣🤣, someone had the Cards in a parley for sure
Proving once again that RB/Occasional QB isn't the future, people that can stand in the pocket and make throws will be always be what teams need. Teams have a position based on running the ball for a reason, get over it
What kind of coaching is this when you are down, 3rd and goal missed and you don't go for 4th? Who ever made the play call lost the cardinals that game. JT for MVP but the colts QB aint on the level of Kyler Murray
yeah football is fun
Wentz meet Ertz 💯❤️
Of course the Cards got steamrolled !!! They’re built like a deck of cards with a five foot three QB- BAHAHAH !!! He needs high heels to play the game !!! Cards will blow it all in the first round . Losers of four straight heading into the playoffs. One and done baby ! Way to go Arizona midgets !!!
U hoed wilson w/ that thumbnail bruh 🤣
Colts gonna hopefully surprise the nfl
I can't believe that Carson Wentz looks like actual Carson Wentz again!
Nice to see my Colts get all these primetime W's. They've earned more primetime games next season.
This is the type of games they need from Carson Wentz...They will go far if he plays like this.
"THE CARDINALS ARE WHO WERE THOUGHT THEY WERE"
Another start and another loss for first round draft bust Kyler Murray.
OMG, what happened to Matt Prater this game?  I know he's kicking himself after this one.
You know what crazy the colts had the most hypenckming in this season cause the bulkiness of the team and one of the best O-lines injuried or not there speed overall on the team and the summer camp workouts were like no other teams and I guess now all that is kinda paying off the streak continues.
Cards are imploding :( he isn't worth what he will get
Cards had the win it's just cuz the kicker
Wentz is starting to get hot again . . Watch out for him  :Eagles fan
Cardinals are by far biggest disappointment in last 2 years.They choked twice.
arizona playmaking is too predictable offensive coach needs to go back to the drawingboard
Philadelphia is my hometown. I haven't lived there in 50 years, but I still love my Philly teams, and I believe, like many fans from that town, that a curse hovers over those teams. The Eagles dumped Carson Wentz after a subpar season and now he's one of the best in the NFL. I mean this in no way as a criticism of Jalen Hurts, he has played well. But the Eagles' management is a mess. Just like the Phils, the Sixers, the Flyers....the history of Philly sports is filled with mistakes like this.
Carson just doesn’t look good. Colts made an crucial error by not aggressively going after Stafford.
Matt Prater is terrible
Gotta hurt when your kicker leaves 7 points on the field. You have one job to do! What a kicker should do after missing 2 consecutive kicks is find a reason to go back to the locker room, get undressed, hop into the shower, get dressed, and start the game-day preparations over erasing the memory of missed kicks.   re-enters the game like it's a whole new game.
Colts just EXPOSED the Fraudinals aka the pretendinals
this season anybody can beat  anybody no one is safe, goddamn I love it. can't wait for the playoffs
Way To Go Colts
LETS GO, BOTH IF MY TEAMS BEAT THE CARDINALS, GO LIONS AND GO COLTS
Why they do Wilson like that
5:50 I mean how many holding penalties were missed here?
Wentz is lucky to get what he got. Missed quite a bit on review tape. Especially with a Coach whose a QB. Team has not reached it full potential.  Or will it. ?
If Jonathan Taylor doesn't win MVP, they need to officially rename the award to MVQB
i dont think the colts deserved that win.  *comiing from a broncos game
Wentz is little by little having a re-emergence. The Eagles will once again regret.
As a Colts fan in Brazil, that was an extraordinary game. The Colts defense has a lot of discipline and allowed with few faults. Odun defense at the last quarter was amazing and it is pity that they didn't put in the highlights. Also, the game showed how important are the starting O-line players for the JT rushes. Although, JT had 100+ rushing yards, it was pretty hard going between the defensive line from the Cards.
Funny this is is if the cardinals don’t start playing better there’s actually a change of them not making the playoffs.
Kicker needs to be kicked
Cardinals will be fine once they get healthy
Cilts are just the best
Colts on a tear what’s happening with the cardinals
Don't tell me the Cardinals are falling apart at the end of the season again😂
2:29 is the most underrated pass I have seen in the NFL this year. Absolutely unbelievablely small window that Carson had to fit it through. The ball literally zipped right through the defenders hands.
Wentz isn’t a threat in the playoffs.
These past 2 thumbnails for Colts games have been savage 🤣
The Colts are a really solid team - they keep it simple - but the Cardinals have that something extra; the unusual creative play. Good game.
Cardinals Trash
Im a little confused why did cardinals kick a field goal when they were down a touchdown on 3rd down instead of trying to go for a touchdown
Congrats to the Colts. Well played!
Kingsbury milking the clock down at the end of the 4th only to kick a FG may have been one of the dumbest sequences I’ve seen
Wentz so much more comfortable in INDY💯
The "giddy yup ride em cowboy" thumbnail💀🤣
Arizona teams will always get you hopes up but then crush them ever season. How do you go from the best team to the worst in a few games.
Colts are getting hot at the right time
this looked like the retard bowl
No wonder Arizona loss cuz all the field goals are missing
Imma say it for Mr.Sharpe. "Walk it to em"
@10:06 you can see the most obvious holding called missed. This was the entire game on Chandler Jones and even some plays on Qwuity Paye. Refs have to call these early to let the elite pass rushers make plays. This game should have been single digits. Let the defense play!😤
That thumbnail tho😂😂lesss gooo pitt
Ikr impressive game for the colts
Eagles are so stupid to get rid of all pro qb like wentz
Good work on the thumbnail, thumbnail guy :)
Wentz is holding this team back otherwise they would be the #1 AFC seed.
Can you imagine if Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck had Taylor as the RB. Oh my God😱😱
Wentz won but God he stinks
it just blows me kuz everybody knows the he couldn’t do nothing with what we had last year (eagles)! and he still did ok smh now look at him doing exactly what i said he would be doing
Ever since the packs took that winning streak away, cards has been going down since..lol
The Colts look dangerous right now. Reminds me of the Giants that took off late in the season that beat the undefeated Pats….watch out!
Quenton Nelson will end his career as the greatest guard of all time
Remember when the Cardinals were undefeated?! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 now my Chiefs even have a better record than these pretenders 😂😂
Kicker showed up to the game high
WOW Wentz stepped up big this game
Cardinals could have won this.  Those missed FG came back to haunt them.  Great game all around colts on fire
The colts look good. But you gotta remember if Taylor goes down that's pretty much their team. Let's be honest Carson Wentz is mediocre at best. If they stay healthy they might give the Patriots and Chiefs some good competition for the AFC.
What a win and what a performance by Carson Wentz
Eagles fans will say Wentz is washed, but NFL fans know he was just unhealthy and injury prone
impressive throws by wentz in that 4th oh my goodness
Cardinals taking  a nose dive out of the playoffs
Cardinals are folding up like a cheap lawn chair made in chy-na 👌🍊
Hey NFL could you stop spoiling every game by the thumbnail.... Its fairly annoying when i want to watch the highlights to find out..
Cardinals secondary got a lot of holes, the field goal misses didn’t help, and the last drive wasn’t playoff level. Bummer they have a lot of injuries too…
Good teams win in December, Arizona time after time show they can't finish a season strong.
That throw in the end zone
Kingsbury will be fired if they continue this slide.  He might already be in serious trouble.  Most of the Cardinals problems are coaching.  Those pre-snap penalties are cleared up in practice.  What is this team doing during the week?  Hard to understand how a team with this much talent can look so bad.
The Colts have played very well and it was nice to see them beat Arizona.  22-16.
Just think about it, the missed fg’s could have saved the game we would have been looking at something so much more different
Colts deserve the playoffs.
Colossal collapse.
I like both teams so had to decide which I would hope for..... I suppose, since Arizona couldn't beat Detroit.... GO COLTS GO !!! 👍 🏈 Congrats Indy.
As a Colts fan this might have been the best win of the season. We had to overcome adversity and find a way to win without 4 lineman, our star linebacker, and starters in the secondary. I'm extremely proud of this team!
Cowboys need to take out some key players next game and they’ll guarantee a win against the cardinals
The horse shoe
Don’t know how the cards have 10 wins give that to lions or sum cuz they lose one 1 player and turn into the lions. Colts defense isn’t even that great. Plus they let the colts pass it down their throats I know they have Pittman but come on man. Keep this up for us next week our will beat ya ass Murray
If the colts get fully healthy by playoff time it’s a wrap
Did the Arizona Cardinals wear their white helmets, cardinal red uniforms and cardinal red pants and beat the Indianapolis Colts, 23 to 22 on a game-winning touchdown in a blue-sees-red Christmas Day NFL showdown in the desert?
Go home cardinals no ones whats you in the playoffs overrated division screw the west overrated division  cause Seahawks overrated  cardinals  overrated 49ers la rams la raiders la chargers Arizona cardinals
Can't bulive the colts won the Cardinals colts are looking really good and they don't even have all there O line
Cards kicker left 7 points on the table cost em the game.
Carson wEntz is terrible him & baKer mayfield don’t deserve starting jobs & teddy bridgwater
LET'S GO COLTS!!! RIGHT NOW I'LL PUT THEM AGAINST ANYBODY...& THE BACKUP PLAYERS DID A GREAT JOB. ✊🏾💯😁
Taylor MVP!!!!!!!!
Cardinals, can not win in December! I knew the Rams would win the division.
This team is looking really scary. They continue to run the ball very well, play great defense, and wentz is looking more comfortable. Colts are going to be a nightmare.
"Laces out" Arizona. Way to go Colts!
Dont give up on the Cardinals, there 's always next season !!! Just dont buy season tickets !!!
Its crazy how Wentz looks completely different from when he was playin for eagles i think he has now understood wat he needs to do with the colts dis team is going to be dangerous to face in the playoffs
My work partner is a Colts fan. Happy to see her team doing so well. Wish I could say the same about my team, which has basically collapsed. Ah well, that's life. Go Colts!
Carson’s mental blockage from Foles winning that super bowl is starting to go away, leaving the top 12 qb we know and love
The COLTS are real   They beat  Buffalo  - Pats  - Cardinals  and their coach is pretty smart ???
wentz runs like elway lol
matty ice is drunk lmao such a legend
Glad to see Carson coming around......I believe people gave up on him too soon because of injuries
cardinals kicker kept blowing it
MURRAY is just like all the rest of the "running QB's" - he'll last about 5 years (maybe !) before injuries sideline his career.
and yet the colts continue to dominate left and right
Colts Nation Babyy we on
imagine colts wins the AFC
Lets be honest here if Pittman wasn't on the receiving end of a lot of those passes it wouldn't have ended well he is a big body that's able to man handle the defender at will
Walk it to ‘‘em and the colts man. The eagles regretting that decision.
This thumbnail isn’t cool
That field must be slippery asf everyone was falling
Every year thiers a 🔥 AFC team u don't wanna 👀 in the playoffs ...  2021 colts  2020 bills lost AFC title game  2019 Titans lost AFC title game 2018 Chiefs lost AFC title game  R colts AFC title game bound? 🤔  Y so serious 😈🃏🥃
game of the year
Colts were very impressive today. Last team I would want to face in the playoffs this year.
K1 might be top 5 shiftiest QB’s in the league no doubt
Nobody knows it but DHOP and JJ Watt are both key players on the offense and defense but that’s something y’all in the comment section don’t know
Man I wish the Browns had a QB
Proof that the Cardinals are a fraud.
As an Eagles fan, I'm glad Wentz and Ertz played well on Christmas
The refs were terrible
Blacks Mexicans and native Americans 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH WE ARE THE REAL JEWS REPENT
If it wasn't official already, it is now. The Cards are overrated af

Wentz does not have the arm talent to make off angle and back foot throws.  He needs to clean that up.
Lets go baltimore colts
That crazy 'fooled ya' punt return was very clever. The Colts on the sideline were desperately waving the running players to look at the other side, but it's human nature, you run towards the man who has his arms out, looking up, because why would you think to do anything else? Never seen that before. Loved it.
Didn't the Cardinals start off great last year and then play like trash?
That thumbnail is sus
The Indianapolis Colts are 9-6,won 8 of their last 10 games after 1-4 start 🔵🐎
These highlights are WAY too detailed.
Cardinals still can’t believe my lions whooped that ass!!!!
Tf didn’t they go for it
Cardinals kicker was hard selling this game he needs to be benched a game or get his act together can’t be selling that hard at this level
No marry Christmas
refs gave that one to the colts
Why would you settle for a field goal with 40 in the red zone🤦🏾‍♂️
If someone who’d never seen football before saw the thumbnail they’d be so confused
Thanks colts . The Rams in first place now .
That missed XP really hurt. Different game at 3rd & goal with 46 sec left if it had been 22-14 and not 22-13. Maybe wouldn't made 2 PT conversion but would still have onside kick option.
Hit  the like if you are COLTS Fan
Cardinals suck!!!! Hahaha gooo colts n packers! 🥳 🥳
The Colts are playing great
Cardinals WTF!!??? 🤬 this happens every year  For the love of God Please get rid of that damn  worthless manager
Murray's snap count is a clap? That's not gonna work in the playoffs lmao. He has no leadership qualities.
I told people the Colts are the scariest team in the AFC. Can run on anyone, AND that defense is stingy. Leonard wasn't even playing!! I'm loving the pressurea by Kwity Paye. He's getting better. Let's go Colts!!
I really don’t like that the thumbnail ruins the outcome of the game 9/10 times. Rodgers is hugging Adams? Pittman hurdling a defender? Hmm, I wonder who wins.   Even when thumbnail offers very little context, it’s easy to tell which team won. :(
Cardinals faded badly late last year.  Same thing now.  They may lose all their remaining games.
I remember when OL depth was an issue last season. Good job by Ballard :)
The sportscasters are so fking annoying. It seems everytime they say "hasn't missed a kick from this distance yet" or "has the most made kicks" as they are kicking a fg they always miss
#FIREKLIFF
I'm really starting to like the Colts
Az going into choke mode. #1 seed a month ago,  now fighting for the 4th seed or even #5 WC slot.
So this is what happened https://youtu.be/znv5y0DWgw4
What a crazy season
Cardinals needs a new kicker, wow
Carson Wentz actually played a very good game looked pretty darn good had shades of what it was like at North Dakota State again. Kyler Murray we found your Achilles heel and that's once your pressured you don't make good throws on the run but you didn't get help with your kicking game either too bad neither one of these teams will beat the Cowboys I hope all had a good Christmas
The Phoenix Cardinals appear to be running out of gas. Phoenix was the last team to go undefeated while Indianapolis is rolling and in control of their own destiny.
Did my mans dirty in the thumbnail 🍆
How is99,#10 working out for you .
2:00 Kyler Murray looks like a toddler trying to get away with a cookie from the cookie jar
I got to see the game live T.Y was a big help he has more catches then the highlights give the man credit!
Bro the Cardinals kicker sucks bro
Cards?how far can they go?
Hey, why’s there football in my flag game?
Number 79 should be pulled from games until he learns how to count.  Too many penalties
That thumbnail lmao. Face full of jingle bells 🤣
I call Kyler Murray- THE Black Gnome -😂 he's so cute small and fast 🏈🏟️
In Kyler Murray's voice "The Cowboys are Ass"  Well you sir get 4 quarters of Ass on the schedule next week !!!!!!! Hope Micah Parson has a field day
Kingsbury is showing that he can’t keep his team together when it counts,  too many team  penalties and mental errors by Murray equal a early exit in the wildcard game.
The cardinals are a very cocky team considering they haven’t won 💩
Cardinals kicker blew that game 🙄🙄🙄
Wow, Carson Wentz doing his version of Nick Foles - sure it's just the regular season but, 9-6 from where they started, who woulda thunk it?🙃
Throw to AJ green and you would win.
Why the hell did the cardinals punt down with 6 minutes left?
Not only did the defense play good without my dawg 53, Wentz shut up some haters and JT ran for a hundred yards with 3rd string lineman. What a Christmas lmao
Can we talk about the violation that thumbnail is 😂😂😂
If the Colts Kicker was on some CBD he wood of made dat kick
The Cardinals are about to become this year's Steelers....
Arizona went from good to looking worser and worser each game they going down hill and they actually looking the Saints because the whole offense was the quarter back  shyt he did everything but received the ball 😆
My team, we took a lost...But ..we don't get beat.." we beat ourselves"..Just like the last 3 games.The Rams ,Green-bay .They didn't beat us..Maybe the Lions..I have no worries. I have GAMEPASS,,.I can clearly see,, when we get healthy..And we get  it in sic...No one can beat us.....WE are a complete team......
That field goal kicker f$%$# over the Cards. 😮‍💨
A horse vs A bird 🤣
Whoever chose the picture for this video doesn't like number 20
The Colt are a great team and Im tired of people pretending they aren't
Colts nice bruh.
The Cardinals have lost to a team with no TEs or Cornerbacks, team missing its entire offensive line, and the Detroit Lions.
LOL Rams let's go, the division is ours
...um...why are the sidelines concrete...is the NFL mental...?
Not a good day for the cardinal s kicker .
1:25 Great to see T.Y. back in the endzone, albeit without his trademark celebration. :D
This thumbnail is legendary 😂
The field goal game tho for both teams
Watched that game Colts didn't win sh**. Cards beat themselves.  All December they've been in a slump. So much talent but not much discipline. Bad strategy during the game to.
With the way the colts are playing rn, they can beat anyone. But man, wtf has happened to Arizona ? They were unbeaten, and people were arguing them as the best team in the league not too long ago. Wtf happened dude ?
With the nfl you just don’t know man be careful betters lol
The Cardinals make no sense!  Kyler needs to play smarter.  Way too long on that last drive.  And not a good safety
kyler murray cant stand in the pocket and deliver passes longer than 5 yards.  he is too small and is scared of the rush.
We're a dangerous team and nobody will want to play the Colts in the playoffs
Wentz would be a more solid passer if he would stand in the pocket more ,,, a little quick to leave the pocket
All this time! I knew the Cardinals are frauds! Never once I believed them.
At this is point the Cards don't seem as much of a scary team now that they've lost 3 straight
I don’t like this as a cowboys fan because we face the Cardinals next week and we can never beat a team doing bad especially if the team was good.
BleedBlue GCG
Lions broke their spirit 💪🏽😈
carson isnt the best, but hes good.
As a eagles fan Carson ain't doing nothing it's all his recievers JT
The Eagles are quite possibly the least intelligent sports organization on the planet. They fired Andy Reed AND Carson Wentz
Yea.... this game was deff rigged, I think Steelers are bumped out of the playoffs now🤔
Cowboys will probably beat them next week as well. The Cardinals don't even look like a playoff team.
So much blue in the stands
cardinals r going to super bowl,political stuff
Things started going downhill after we lost our center Rodney Hudson
#SameOldCardinals
The typical late season Kliff Kingsbury slide continues.. Its the same every season back to his days at Texas Tech
Cards would have won if Prater was himself
I've been saying this, "NO HOPKINS, NO OFFENSE"  sad 😂🤣
Glad to see Carson Wentz playing good.  I’m a Cowboys fan but there’s no question in my mind that he’s better than severely overrated Dak. Always thought that.
Noice! Good to see my team hang in there for the win! JT is an absolute beast out there!
One of Wentz best games this season. He was quick with his reads and knew when to scramble out the pocket. Made some great throws under pressure. Hope he’ll carry this play to the post season.
Arizona fell off bad
Crazy how no one is talking about how well Wentz has Played lol
That Colts Running game can puncture a whole elephant! It's too mean for the streets!!!
That was dumb asf you had one more down to get a touchdown,  but you elected to kick a field goal on 3rd down!!!!!!!!!!!
Ollll’ Walk’it’2’um’Wentz 😩😂😂😂😂
Violated with the thumbnail
Murray’s team folded on him
cardinals are the choke kings of the NFL... always have been...
Cardinals loss this game they gave it to the colts
Lots of resilience for Team that started 1-4 just bad luck to begin the season but glad they've found their stride
I'm a pats fan but always like the Baltimore colts with Faulk running the ball
Crazy how the colts record is 9-6 and the almighty 7-0 start cards are only 10–5
Kyler slid wtf
Thanks NFL for not showing this on TV Nation wide.......
Matt Prater was really in the Christmas spirit. He gift wrapped a win for the Colts on Christmas.
Cardinals are starting to have a 2020 Steelers season 🤣🤣
Great gutty win Colts. I was cheering for you loud and seriously laughing out loud at the hapless Cardinals. Thanks for the Christmas present win and hope you do well in playoffs.
At the end of the day running your way to a Super Bowl will not work and wentz kept them in the game, he needs to put the game away the defense was playing great and they missed extr points, he needs to capitalize on those plays
That was super bowl version Wentz
Murray is good but make him beat you with his arm. Don't let him run around all day like a squirrel!!!
Cards getting exposed.
Let’s go colts
I am an eagles fan. When half of our fan base started civil war over Pederson and Wentz I said we will be watching the colts in the playoffs because of carson. He's a leader and a damn good QB. Good luck to indi
Lets go Colts!!
Woohooo colts helped my cowboys out thank you 😊
KYLE MURRAY IS A FRAUD!  HE SHOULD NOT BE A PRO BOWLER!
No one’s gonna talk about the refs giving Colts sum BS A** calls…. Cardinals don’t lose
Cardinals sold. They started out looking like Green Bay and are now level with the Titans. As a Titans fans this doesn’t really effect us much. We’d have to lose to the Dolphins and the Texans to not win against our division. Even with our injuries we should be ok. We could easily be the number 1 or 2 seed if we didn’t sell against the Jets and the Texans. Henry will be back in time for the playoffs so we still have an ok chance
Murray is a bust!!
Good game I'm impressed by the way the Colts are playing. The AFC front runners are starting to emerge and believe in themselves.  Ertz is amazing pick up for the Cardinals I hated when he played for Philadelphia what a outstanding player.
1:28 ayo wtf was that? I woulda benched his ass after that
Worst kicker i ever seen 😂😂
So no one gonna talk about how disrespectful the thumbnail is?
The cards biggest weakness us their kicker. He missed a total of what 8 points? That would've been the win smdh. Glad to see Wentz moving on doing well he deserves it and much more
Did Zack Ertz get a flag for spiking the ball on the opponent’s  sideline? Just wondering cause Waller did
Impressive win by the Colts. I'm a Bears fan but since they aren't in playoffs I hope Colts win it all. Love their offensive line and coach.
10:23 what a throw Wentz.
As a Chiefs fan, no one wants any part of the colts right now.
All I see is Arizona finding ways to lose...Let's get ready for the playoffs
Los pajarracos sin ayuda no ganan,los comentaristas llorando decían que por errores perdían los pájaros pero así le ganaron a los 49ers por puros errores,jijijiji pobres pájaros se desvielaron,
I love how you’re spoiling the highlights by showing the score in the thumbnail making it pointless to watch the video.
On behalf of all rams fans, thank you.
Atrocious night by Cardinals kicker Matt Prater.... Announcer gave him the kiss of death after saying he has more 50 yard field goals made than anyone in NFL history.....    Goes on to miss two field goals and 1 extra point which if he made , the Cards woulda won 23-22 ...
Hindsight being what it is, I am so glad the Lions did not re-sign Prater for all that money. 2 missed FG and a missed extra point.
Wentz has the ugliest throwing motions
has there ever been an nfl head coach go from hearing talks of coach of the year, to possibly being in the hot seat? all within a few games?
WENTZ BALLED OUT
Rly out here with our practice squad 🥳💙
Wentz says he's a starter not a back up QB n it looks like he is livin Up to those comments
carsen beats the niners and cards. that's pretty tough
Looks like the Cardinals are in meltdown mode, would like to see the Rams win the division. However, I think Green Bay will be the team to beat in the NFC, imo.
pittman reminds me of d-hop with his physicality and ability to dominate w size - lets hope he can continue his trajectory
Imagine if those field goals were on point the score would be roughly 26-22
These Colts are fr 😳
Good thing Cardinals are taking advantage of AJ Green being on the team....
Rams better capitalize on these losses by the Cards and win the division. The last thing I need to see is that overrated Kyler Murray and his cursed team playing at SoFi on Super Bowl Sunday.
I found out after the game was over the Colts had what? 4 of 22 starters? But it still would have been embarrassing to lose to a team that made the Lions win.
Colts looks good with wentz this year! Pittman and Taylor are great
Colts look good with Wenzhou this year
No more Carson wentz hate .
NFL doing the cardinals dirty with that thumbnail though…
The Colts are one of the unique stories of 2021.  I had faith in them since I saw how good they could be vs Rams in week 2.  Beating New England means they're a serious force in the AFC.  Wentz has been inconsistent, but this could be one of those playoffs like 2007 and 2012. Eli Manning 2007, and Joe Flacco 2012, or even Foles 2017, all shocked the hell out of me.  A so so QB suddenly gets it together for a brief shining moment.
Cardinals luck has run out
With the Cardinals losing it’s actually a blessing in disguise for some other NFC teams like Dallas
Cardinals have been exposed…..they will be lucky to win a playoff game this season, especially with the injuries they have been dealt.
I like this colts team ! They make big plays in defense and in offense wentz playing right now ! What a throw to patmon ! Walking to them
On the commercial Malholmes could Oprah Everyone in the stadium with sneakers
That might of been the worse onside attempt I’ve seen ever lol Not only the kick but the recovery attempt too
Good game.
Cardinals are over rated.
While the colts did play good. We shot ourselves in the foot time and time again with penalties, bad play calling by our coach. We started off hot now the fire is rapidly going out time to call it season we ain't making it past the Wild Card that's even if we make the Wild Card. 🙄
This proves again any QB can play well, and get in rhythm when you're committed to the run, and playing Defense.. This league has gotten too use to pitting everything on a star QBs shoulders ..when in reality you can make a playoff ru,n with a game manager at QB. As long as you have those 2 things I mentioned.
cardinals are a massive joke, always will be
I’d like to see the slow mo replay if the pass interference call in this game alongside the no-call of the Seahawks game last week. It’s amazing how different refs can have such different opinions on the same rule. 🤷
Prater lost that game. Not the Cardinals as a whole.
By winning this, we show that we can win pretty much any game. Our defense was shattered and we still pulled the victory off of a solid team.
The Eagles didn't appreciate Wentz. They said he was the problem. I'm glad he left that toxic team.
Great Job Colts!!!
The Colts are a very dangerous 9-6 team.
1:58 when did kyler murray become lamar jackson
Pat Mac and the Boys are gonna have a hell of a Monday with this win.
The cardinals are choking
Someone told me the colts wasn’t balanced. After that ravens game I knew they was figuring things out!
The Colts are the real deal. They are playing like they want it.
https://youtu.be/FVIxhS4Uz0g 1
the field goal kicker really let the Cardinals down.
Great game but yet another one with terrible officiating decisions, where's the accountability for their poor performances?
Two people slipped on that shitty field
That WENTZ Td pass was a thing of BEAUTY!!!🔥
Yo NFL and NBA players....they forced y’all to get vaxxed, but too many of you are still catching COVID......yet nobody is saying nothing. WOW......for the love of money ey.?!?!?
Cardinals get your head out of your ass!! What the hell !!
GO MICHEL PITTMAN JR!!!!
$20 bucks the Cardinals don't make the playoffs
“Every missed field goal from Christmas Day”
Great Win even with all of our injuries... #COLTSNATION!
Man, the Cardinals are in a SLUMP… that or are pretenders till the very end.
Climate crisis > football
Both teams garbage but somebody had win it.
The Rams return to their rightful spot atop the nfc west
My Cardinals will NOT make it out of the first round...Go Vikings!!!
I remember watching Franco Harris run out of bounds all the time to avoid getting tackled. Everyone criticized him for it. Now, it's hard to find one of these kids who don't make a beeline for the sideline.
The moment the Cards get a chance to play a real team, this happens. They aren't ready for the NFC Playoffs.
I'm colts fan from the UK what a result so proud of my team playoffs here we come
Cards lost it on the kicking game...tough way to let it slip away.
Colts are really good this year and I admit it. But my question is  Are the Cardinals falling apart after 8-0???
Who the hell clips these games like here watch this 1st and 10 2 yard run ???
Mistakes everywhere…..Cardinals need to clean things up…..and find someone who can kick
let’s gooo cards it’s alright !! This just proves to me ya’ll really want it. It’s okay if we fall this yr I still love you rather it’s good or bad games every sundays or prime games. We WILL get our super bowl ring 💍 #GOCARDS #RISEUPREDSEA
Indyyyyyq
that's the cardinals we all know and love  collapsing at the end of the season
We need my boy Pittman to get a better madden card so I can actually use him lmao
I have a lot of trust in wentz with the colts look good
Not a colts fan but I tweeted all this in September before season started an said this team wold knock kc out the playoffs actually
That kicker for the cards solddddd
Great road win Colts & as a Cowboys fan knock the Cardnials on down some more lol.
Anybody else out there? Notice that Kyler Murray runs like a Thelma from Scooby-Doo
Slip sliding away... Slip sliding away... You know the nearer your destination the more you're  Slip sliding away...
man, good for carson!!!
That’s one of the most disrespectful thumbnails I’ve ever seen.
You don’t throw the ball 40x with Murray as your QB, he’s not built for that, he just isnt
Carson come back to Philly..
Wentz had a very good day.
Man they really needed that one Go Colts !! 👍🏈
Good for the Colts.As a Ram fan,I can't stand the Cardinals
Cards have become the punching bag for the rest of the league, wow.
Wentz's should throw it to the left hash about ten completions in a row, what are you doing on defense cards? 🤷
D Hopkins is literally 3/4th their team
As an Eagles fan I can’t tell you how hard I’m clinching my fists seeing Wentz throwing these darts and consistently making big plays
Watcha got !!!!!!!??? We in SD on Fleet Watch  Am snatching Football from you  Left and right from Double Blue numbers  Watch me get that 1 yard Victory Formation on you ,
If the Cards don't get with it. They're gonna bomb with any playoff chances? Good win by the Colts though.
Colts looking something serious in the AFC and the league in general
Lol I bet Philly fans just love seeing Wentz play like this.
En un partido asi de complicado se necesita un pateador confiable ,no se puede ganar con alguien que falla 2 goles de campo y un punto extra  ...por eso vale tanto un Justin Tuker ...
The Colts are definitely a force to be reckon with to anyone!
The colts have the hungriest team out there right now. All these guys coming off the bench want to keep their spot.
this colts team is a team to avoid in the playoffs, if they don't turn the ball over they're very hard to beat
BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT! LET’S GO COLTS!!! 💙💙💙
Bro the cardinals do this EVERY DAMN YEAR BRUH
This really help the cots
Cardinals are just blowing the last half of the season.
THIS WILL BE SUPERBOWL 56 SO IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE 1ST 6 SUPERBOWLS THERE WERE 4 TEAMS THAT MADE IT TO THE SUPERBOWL TWICE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THESE 4 TEAMS ALL HAVE A SHOT AND IT COULD COME DOWN TO THE CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR ALL 4 TEAMS. SO OBVIOUSLY GREEN BAY WON THE FIRST 2 AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY THE BEST TEAM IN THE NFL. THE OTHER 3 TEAMS EACH SPLIT THEIR 2 SUPER BOWL APPEARANCE'S. THE OTHER NFC TEAM IS THE COWBOYS AND THEY CURRENTLY HAVE A GREAT SHOT AT MAKING A RUN. ON THE AFC SIDE WE HAVE THE CHIEFS AND THE COLTS AS THE OTHER 2 TEAMS. KC IS THE TOP AFC TEAM AND INDY IS ARGUABLY THE HOTTEST TEAM RIGHT NOW SO HONESTLY THIS COULD BE A HISTORY LESSON IF THIS PLAYS OUT THE WAY I THINK IT WILL. NFC CHAMPIONSHIP DALLAS VS. GB & AFC CHAMPIONSHIP INDY VS. KC.
Gotta give it to Carson he looks like a whole different QB this year. I'll trade him right now for Baker Mayfield
The cardinals may have played horrible, but to hang on and play the way the colts did down half their team has to be talked about.
From a rams fan, thank you colts
https://youtu.be/rHhieYC77X4
I never want the game to be on the kicker.  This one was to some degree.
Washington Fan an I can say the Eagles gave up on Wentz He A Baller Just Needed A Oline An Somebody to Believe in him
Cardinals need a new kicker I see
Cardinals are pretenders. Regardless of any injuries or players being out due to COVID, anytime you lose to the 1-11-1 Lions, you lose respect. You're not for real!
Wentz suck
I got my favorite christmas present, a colts win with half of our starters out, impressive!!
The only reason the colts won is because the cardinals have a terrible kicker
Cardinals = 2003 Chiefs
10:00 Notice the devil horns thrown up by the referree. He could've just used his index and middle to signify, which they used to. This is not an accident.
if Cards have a good O Line Kyle would be having a good game
Kingsbury on the hot seat?
Another game the Colts should have had about 20 holding calls....the NFL and Fans are so desperate they can just look away
Arizona is all done it doesn't matter if they make it to the playoffs or not they're going nowhere
Remeber like week 6 or 7, when the colts writers were advising benching wentz for the rest of the season to conserve their 1st rounder.
M.V.P.!!!! M.V.P.!!!!!!!!
Arizona is going down a dark path
Marco Wilson might have to see somebody about this disrespectful thumbnail😂😂
Just want to say that the thumbnail pic for these highlights is the most perfect pic ever.
Very funny the colts think they are world better after this game
Matt prater lost the cards the game sheesh
We just gon ignore the thumbnail pic
Why kick the field goal on 3rd and goal??
Underhand passes should be considered a fumble not an incompletion.
Cards got an L on Christmas. That's all I wished for. 😂
The annual Kliff Kingsbury losing streak to ends the season
I've been telling my friends not to sleep on the Colts. They control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball and that will win a ton of games. They got off to a slow start, but they are ballin now!!
its going to be very fun to watch all you colt fans crying after they blow their season in the playoffs. you idiots should know better.
What are people gonna say now that JT still got 100 yards with the backup offensive line playing today?
murray sucks its only a running back trade for baker or lawrence
Chiefs Colts rest of the AFC
Dang, the Colts beat two of the best teams in football, I think they are going far  into the playoffs
I love seeing Wentz make plays brings me back
Kyler needs to run more often, if the Cardinals are going to win games.
12:29 nice job editor.
Gotta take my hat off to the colts, them boyz playing hard.
The Colts are a contender the owner is the weak link.
5 seed is hot watch out go colts
Cardinals have been exposed
sounds stupid, but can someone explain why they stopped the game at 40 seconds to go?
Cardinals kicker aint got no more job left
When did indie sign matt prater tho?
Cardinals fell off alot. Still a good team, but no where near the threat they seemed to be in the first half of season
Prater lost the game
Wow - nobody expected happy horses win against angry birds...
nice non-holding calls all day long 👍
I just like watching Pittman do his thing
Ok not everyone who beats the depleted Cards is a beast now…. Give colts their props but these cards are not the team to beat any more.
Kingsbury panics and goes away from the run, and goes for 4th down too early. He lacks wisdom and composure in game management. He needs to be an OC for a really good NFL HC.
Cardinals kicker missed seven points worth of field goals which could have been the difference in the game.
This colts offense is very dangerous Taylor at running back and ertz and Hilton in receiving that’s scary for a packers fan🥺 I don’t wanna play them in the super bowl🙃
Arizona is overrated as hell not everyone sees it
Kicker, kicked them out the Game
Ever since Zach ertz joined the cardinals They have been garbage lol
Cowboys now should be #1! Colts are in n top 5 no doubt now! Colts are for real too
Just once I like to see an nfl game without intentional bad pass interferance calls
not the prettiest win but got the job done i suppose.
Colts gonna be a hard team to beat in the playoffs. Dallas should send them a christmas gift just put them in #2 seed.
Arizona miss playoffs Colts have a top ten rb
I just think Wentz is the big question mark.Both good teams for sure.I just can't see Wentz hoisting a Lombardi trophy.
Props to the Colts. But can we talk about the cardinals ghosting act?  Yikes!!👀
Like what I'm seeing from the colts in this game
Joe Buck is so annoying...
Wow nice defense by the Colts. Crazy pressure on Kyler.
The Cardinals cannot seem to buy a win at the moment lol , that was a very good win for the Colts just what they needed
I didn't get to see the whole game, but from this vid it looked like Wentz made some really nice throws. Good for him.
This just in! the Cardinals have just fired their entire grounds crew 😂😂… those players are slipping all over the place 😂😂
Colts are the most underrated team this season. Carson Wentz really showing that he's still a SB champ.  Cardinals would have won if they could make a field goal
I mean u got one job kick 🦵 the damn 🏈
Smoke the Bills and then beat the Pats & Cardinals. Colts are 9-0 when Taylor rushes for 100+. Team is SCARY heading to the Playoffs.
If the cardinals wouldn't have missed so many field goal attempts the result might have been different, but luckily the Colts won!
Love it, because all the sports announcers were giving the Cardinals the game...and the Colts pulled it off,
Let's go Brandon !
Cards are this years steelers
Not too much to say. Merry Christmas to both Teammates' Kaka. Be Determined Like Orchestration. Good Bye!
Thank you Colts! - Cowboys fan
Wow not good for all Arizona sports teams this holiday season suns, cards, and cats, all took losses
Man the cardinals need to be more disciplined with the penalties, it lost them this game
Still can't believe Connor got into the pro bowl averaging less than 4 yards a carry
I'm 5 -1 took the cards
Carson Wentz improved his performance after an atrocious game against NE last weekend. Arizona needs better coaching against penalties and miscues... They defeated themselves in this game at home.
Why are cardinal fans so quiet?🤫
Gg from a colts fans up next raiders then jags we’ll go 11- 6 I hope
Different offense without Hopkins
cardinals are crumbling down
The colts and the 49ers were in the same position a week ago. Both playing great at the end of the season. The 49ers messed up loosing their last game hurting their playoff chances. The colts took care of business
Big budda  💪🏾
1:27 that's one pump too far 🤣
This video's thumbnail is inappropriate for children.
The Cardinals are reminding me of the Steelers from last year
Cardinals need a kicker...that man left this game behind him ...they could still win division coz i trust Murray more than Stafford under pressure...
Marcus spears deserve to hold this ducking L
We all wishful thinking because it's going to be the Packers and Chiefs in the SB. They basically told us last year from commercials.
6:50 Is it me or does that always work?
What an atrocious performance by the kicker. Gave the Cards no chance
4:31 even tho this one didn’t play out well I still find it insane how fast kyler recognises these kinds of situations like fumbled handoffs or broken plays
Nobody talking about Matt Prater? That guy should never be allowed to kick any ball ever in his life again. If the government gets notice of him kicking a balloon at a children's birthday party they should have the right to cut off his leg and end this missunderstanding of a career once and for all
As an eagles fan that has loved Wentz since day 1 I'm glad to see him win and hope he gets into the playoffs. Meanwhile in philly we are back to doing dumb philly things.
Cardinals just sucking it up at the worst possible time
*The crypto market has been favourable in the past weeks, I keep missing out on this opportunity, I'm most certainly very impatient how can I ever make a profit in the crypto market.*
Gift win from a 💩 kicker. Worst way to lose a game.
Wentz will be one n done
I don't think Cardinals have anything to play for in these last 4 games. They will clinch the playoffs if Vikings, Eagles or Saints lose this week, or in any of the next 2 games. Then cards will have their superstar center back - hudson, superstar receiver - hopkins, or even maybe Watt, who is a superstar run blocker and a great leader. I just hope that it matters by then.
Think they can!!!
Thank you Colts this coming from A Rams fan. HORNS UP 💋
not a PI on 20
That thumbnail is so foul😅
Thee most underrated QB in the league! Keep overlooking him nfl! We love being the underDOGS! BTW... Isaiah comin up!
every team definitely goes through a little hardship. The rams went thru a 3 game losing streak, but hopefully they win it out this regular season and into the playoffs.
Good job Colts. Penalties almost hurt them.
The lions defense laid the blue print on how to stop Murray. On top colts defense is very stealthy!!
Lot of colts fans acting like the cardinals kicker didn't have the worst game of his career. It wasn't a good solid game. The cardinals kicker just choked and then the team didn't trust him so they did things they wouldn't usually do. I mean a win is a win but idk if I'd be as hype as yall are.
Merry Kwanzaa to all
What a terrible game lmao
Sorry but kyler ain't that guy. Remember when he was in the mvp convo. Was never gonna happen
As an eagles fan, I have a soft spot for wentz. I am glad he is with the right coach in frank wright.
that last touchdown scoring drive was a thing of beauty
LACES OUT COLT. RAY FINCKLE WOULD BE PISSED
We just not going to talk about the thumbnail to this video?
Thank you for the Gift Cardinals, Let’s Go Rams.
The colts are going to the superbowl to face aaron rodgers and the packers
Michael Pittman jr is ballin out this season
Looks the cardinals need to try an Asian kicker.
games like this make me truly think about all those “ nfl is rigged comments “
Ayo what’s good with the thumbnail
If anybody in the NFL is questioning how tough the colts really are watch this game right here. Some positions  were down to 3rd string players and 3 positive covid tests going in and still got the W. This team is hungry and will not let anyone get in their way.
This game leaves me confused so much so did the Lions vs Cardinals 😭😭☠️☠️🤷🏽‍♂️😳😬
We not gonna talk about how the nfl did the cardinals dirty with the cardinals player having nuts in his face in the thumbnail😭💀
Little Red Birds straight up suck ass im sorry they are a fkn mess..
arizona kicker messed up 7 points, now i'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson...... but......🙄
Despite Carson wentz colts are the best team in the NFL. nobody is gonna want nothing to do with the colts come January
Flag on the thumbnail😂
The Cardinals and the Second half of the Saison , as always the run out of Power and winning :D I love that and for the Colts very important Win again great Job !
Cardinals are playoff pretenders. 👎👎👎. You don't start 7-0 and lose to the Lions. 😂
Full on tbag for the thumbnail, nice
K.Murray is a Lamar Jackson 2.0
Colts are no joke. Taylor is a legit star at running back. Hoping you take the south because the Titans and their fanbase being miserable is sustenance for me
Colts look good I wonder if they’re gonna lose in the wildcard or divisional this year😂😂😂😂
The Cards are going to go down in history as the first team ever to start 7-0 and fail to make the playoffs. The only way they get in is if they back in through someone losing. They can't beat a 1 win team then they can't beat anyone. They're going to finish a disappointing 10-7.
FUBO sucks not taking prepaid debit cards.  It's bullsh!t
Indianapolis COLTS 22 vs 16 Arizona CARDINALS
Colts defense looks solid despite injuries.
Damn it starting 7 and all was just a fluke they figured us out and we can't do nothing about it it seems like now Kyler Murray is going to be a big ass? Behind your name too
Congratulations Arizona, y'all are the 2020 Seahawks, except y'all ain't gonna win the division
Thankyou Colts
Nice win.Thank you from Rams..
Love to see Pittman Jr. & Patmon celebrating Patmon’s TD. Go see Pittman’s YouTube channel.
Cardinals are Unraveling
That was a really good game.
that 53 yarder went in lol
Cardinals really just throwing their season…😐😬
Why does Kyler look like a highschooler🙂  Just saying...
Cardinals suck lol
I love wentz but his decision making in playoffs will be Colts downfall, you can see it a mile off.
Man I wish the Colts would've made a deal that included Ertz when Wentz came over.  Game was on pretty late, I bet Irsay was nodding out before halftime
That's 3 straight losses for the Cards.....
Don’t let this distract y’all from the fact that wentz sucks
im lost, how is 5:33 pass interference?
While I would completely understand if Ryan Kelly didn’t play the rest of the season, it would be great if he could come back maybe against the Jaguars. I know it’s tough to go to work after going through what he went through but maybe he might feel up to it by then
This NFL thumbnail editor needs a raise
Cards are a the definition of frauds.
damn,  the kicker lost them that game
Cards are garbagio
90% of all the comments talking about how strong the colts are (they are) were saying the patriots were the best team in football less than a month ago. lol NFL fans are a joke.
Why you show replays of incomplete pass, but not touchdowns?
As a rams fan thanks colts.
#7:11 Absolute Perfect Dime Ball by Murray😍💥💨 Couldn't have gotten any better!
As a Rams fan I wanna thank Wentz and his team for showing up tonight!!
Cardinal's kicker needs to be fired right away.
Cardinals fanboys, who got upset all season long how the Cardinals never got enough credit for winning early, well... this month is why no one was sure.
Looks like the old Cardinals are back in form …..
This puts LA in 2nd seed atm. GB 1 the Bucs 3 and the Girls 4. 1 and 2 spots are crucial imho.
Kliffs coaching history 2013: started 7-0, next games went 1-5 2015: started 5-2, then 2-4 2016: started 3-1, then 2-6 2017:started 4-1, then 2-6 2018:started 5-2, then 0-5 2019: started 3-3-1, then 2-7 2020: started 5-2 then 3-6 (without the hail Murray its 2-7) 2021: started 7-0,  currently 3-5 after This is a real stat that people need to be paying attention to. Arizona needs to let Kliff go
So did the Eagles  get Indys 1st rounder yet?
9:30 Earlier this season, Kyler would have completed this 3rd down pass for a 1st down. Shameful.
Man, I needed cards to win this. Hopefully we handle business vs the Broncos tomorrow and next week we face the colts.💯😤🏴‍☠️  #RaiderNation
When you play against an in the zone Lamar Jackson everyone else looks like chumps. Good game Colts.
Why is this on fast forward???
This dude Michael pitman is a beast his height and speed use the right way is like baby megatron
Cardinals really had everyone thinking they were a good team. Frauds.
Salute to our Oline Colts nation
Bro cardinals need to fix that bogus turf everyone on the colts just slipping everywhere
I hate when people talk about “ well the game would have been different if this player or that player wasn’t out” but I think the excuse is legitimate here! Jesus, basically the whole o line and a 1/3 of the defense was out. I wonder how much different it would have been with the whole team intact 🤷‍♂️
That just bumped up the Rams from the #5 seed to the #3 seed.
That's cold NFL! His only 3 pointer of the day yall didn't show! 🤣🤣🤣
nice game prater
JT is a workhorse in the bck field
If Lamar Jackson had as healthy a team as Arizona they would probably be undefeated.
The Colts are a dangerous team… they are getting hot at the right time, and we bettors do know what that means…
Play Stafford and take out kyler he’s playing like garbage lately
But I’m very sick of them not using aj green almost at all
ravens paid cardinals kicker to throw this game. ravens fan here.
Did the cards dirty with that thumbnail
If the NFL highlight video shows a team about to attempt the extra point, means they missed it :)
NOBODY wants to draw the Colts in the postseason right now
Yes Arizona lost but I tell you those refs had it out for the cards all night, they didn’t call so many holding calls and interfence calls and called some many penalties on the cards that weren’t penalties they were definitely the colts 12th man on the field. The cards got very robbed
If I finally become a level 2 yoga instructor, I’ll still get the Patrick price 😁
Very happy for  Wentz, he laid his heart out for this game and his teammates.
Damn T.Y Hilton still play for the Colts?????
The Cardinals K lost that game for them
I thought we were awfully close to seeing an actual kicker get benched.
I think it's safe to assume Matt Prater did not have a jolly good Christmas
That thumbnail is sus 😅😅
love seeing wentz’s comeback
I've said it once and I'll say it again; STOP SHOWING THE RESULT OF THE GAME IN THE THUMBNAIL. The foreshadowing is way too obvious, it kills the suspense of the game...
12:25 field goal???
The colts are an example on why you should never just give up on your team when they have a bad start, Arizona is an example on why you should claim to be Super Bowl bound after starting off hot
For all those that hated wentz. How does this taste like? SALTY!!
I really hate the colts. Bunch of pretenders taking up playoff room from teams that can Auctually do damage. 1000 dollars colts get blown out in the playoffs
GO COLTS
Let's go brandon
Beastoooooooooo!!!!!
colts are the team you don't wanna play in the post season. congrats indy fans.
Cardinals would’ve won but they missed too many field goals
The kicker lost the game for cardinals
I swear their screwed if anything happens to JT tho… he’s a force man. They lean on him a lil to much in my opinion but if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. But they run him to much that’s exactly what’s gonna happen… he’s gonna break lol… then what??
Gotta respect both these teams !  Cardinals and Colts fans are pretty cool too😁👍 I couldn’t decide who to root for so I just watched every play and gave props where they were due. Good game but I don’t know if it would have been the same outcome if D Hop was there. That guy is amazing
I watched this game and could not for the life of me find the Cardinals offensive line.
Cardinals are slowly starting to look like the 2020 Steelers
two avererage teams no great players and the only really good player is murray. bo ring
All i have experienced as a Cards fan over the years is a team that goes on early win spurts then later finds ways to lose games end of season completely ridiculous play calling n focus im done being a Cards fan
Did I see a field goal on 3rd and goal??
As a Rams fan I would like to thank the Colts.
THEY LOST THIER EDGE  CARDINALS
Great job Cardinals kicker. That's how u steal momentum from your own team.
lions allowed less points and scored more. long story short super bowl next year
Colts are now 9-1 when Wentz has below 35 pass attempts for the game,0-5 when he’s at 35+
Hines' catch was incredible.
I can't believe they choose that picture for the miniature 😂 it looks like a video from pornhub 😂
AFC better look out for the Colts
What a thumbnail!
I been a Cards fan for years n im DONE this team makes me mad im over it TO HELL WITH THE CARDINALS bad play calling loosing to inferior teams im done no longer a Cards fan
you know things are bad when your normally dependable kicker loses the game for you
Omg trade that POS kicker for the Cards tomorrow!!
Wentz looked good
Just think how ridiculous this team would be if Andrew Luck were airdropped in to play quarterback. Wentz played a solid game today and made a few impressive throws, but Andrew Luck was the franchise; broken and ruined by Chuck Pagano and Ryan Grigson.
Kyler consistently makes it look routinely
That play by baker was amazing.
Grats Colts. Cardinals screwing up our (Eagles) draft position by choking this game away 😑
I was expecting a blowout because of the Colt's missing players; came out of it surprised yet proud of the team. Sorry Cardinals... you kind of did it to yourselves. Those small mistakes add up. Still, I hope everyone stays healthy & happy.
Murray is super overhyped. He's just a smaller drew lock
I just want to thank Johnathan Taylor for not scoring a touchdown.
We are winning but it doesn't change the fact that Carson still scares me as qb1. Holds ball too long, jittery in the pocket, and throws into coverage. Still not using JT or Hines enough. good win but i hate being this nervous every time carson throws. Felt safer with Rivers.
God dammmm Kyle Murray is fast...
Is Carson Wentz back?!?! Budda Baker is a beast!!
6:43 rams: I want the copyright of that
This is part of why I love the NFL over college. A team can get hot later in the season and despite their record be deadly. If this was college they would be heading to another pointless bowl game.
Cardinals 7-0 to this.
The Colts have played several  teams with pretty good records at a time when they were down.  This is one and the 49ers are another.  Unbelievable defense.  What was Wentz' qb rating, I wonder.  Go TYH.
Ain't nothing new the cards always choke the second half of the season as always.
scary times ahead for the afc
W for Wentz
Remember all the hype about the cardinals during the start of the season, they’re acting just like the Steelers from last year
Glad to see Carson Wentz doing well, many people said he would never be a good quarterback again, here he is though.
Just came for the comments 😎 Colts nation stand the f up put some respect on our name we ain't playing around!! 💪🏽🏆
Damn what’s going on with the cards
I was just there and horrible calls from the refs I’m a colts fan but they did a lot of bullshit calls.
Lions broke the cardinals
NO BIG Q NO LEONARD BIGG WWWW
One thing's for certain: there are no DOMINANT teams in the entire NFL...... Not One!
The cardinals kicker lost this game for them that final drive was supposed to be a game winning drive
well... real playoff teams really shows up around this time of the season.
Colts sucks not going far barley whoop this team if they do make a playoff they one and done this was the worst Christmas game ever in history 😂
Another L and he gets the pro bowl weird
It´s interesting to see that in both games that happened yesterday, no receiver left the field with major injuries. That Saints x Bucs game was not normal, that was not a great defense by the Saints - it was a slaughter, and I´m surprised the NFL is accepting that as OK.
Same old Cardinals... This  team loves being mediocre and settling for less... 😔
Cards kicker really screwed them
As a Cowboy fan i will gladly take a Card L.
As a life long Cardinal’s fan, I am well prepared for this collapse.
Im a Colts fan and happy as hell about this win, especially with the decimated roster we have due to covid, But if those kicks were good we're talking about a completely different game here. Cardinals definitely played lights out football. Wonder what the streak was for turnovers we caused in a game? Had to be pretty long, and couldnt get anything tonight from AZ. Go Colts!
Wentz looked real good. Baker the ankle reaper with a nice tackle to get Wetz down. very satisfying for a defensive guy to make a stop like that. rarely see.
if matt prater wasn't ass it would've been 23-22 forcing colts to try a game winning drive with 40 seconds
So no one is gonna talk about Pittman stepping up big time man I remember watching him at usc I’m glad to see him balling out he’s a big time player one of my favorite receivers that is underrated
It's looking more and more like the Cardinals were just a mirage. They are doing their annual fadeout. The Colts look scary. I wouldn't want to face them in the playoffs.
Best I’ve seen Wentz play, I’m happy for him
How the hell did Murray get selected for the all star game over Stafford 🤔🤷‍♀️😆
Those miss field goals killed the cards
Colts paid the refs heavy b4 the game
Cards realistically are who we thought they are. Hated when all analysts would say they were the best team in nfl
Here we go again..... Well maybe next year we'll make the playoffs. I don't see us winning any more games. 😒
To you colts fans us outsiders think you guys are extremely dangerous and absolutely can see you guys winning a SB this year... so if you think you're just being biased I'm telling you as an outsider God damn you guys gonna be the wild card team who wins it all... you guys are for real
Wentz for MVP
Yes Carson Wentz showed a lot of great poise. Look how many players were out because of the covid restrictions. The colts still won. The colts follow the regulations and the rules. But the Titans Antonio Brown gets the falsified papers and he's back in the game the other night. Isn't falsifying papers classified as breaking the law ? Isn't that a criminal liability? Why does he get to play and not be charged? Uhhh. The colts all follow the rules. I doubt seriously the Titans would have won the other night without Brown.
Dude getting tea bagged hard in the thumbnail !!
The Cardinals missed 3 easy field goals. They would have won had they simply made their kicks.
Kyler Murray is a bust…. He’s not even 5’9 , more like 5’7
Alright so The Colts might be legit
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}  OOOWEE......GREAT  GAME..!!!
Whoever edited this is a colts fan
I wish the Cowboys 🤠 would mix some screens with the play action.
Dezzzzzziiiiiiii with the td
Damn, that PI call at the end of the first half was among the worst PI calls I've seen all season
7 lineman out and still pulled a dub!
Kyler Murray made the pro bowl over Stafford, 😭😭😂😂😂… this dude is a scrub lol 😂
Now if you're a Colts fan the thing you love the most about Carson Wentz's stat line is no interceptions to go along with 225 yards on 18/28 throwing from the field with two touchdowns.
I was at that game pretty nice stadium
Great job colts!
NEXT MAN UP!!! Love to see the depth in the Colts roster. Great win! Go Colts!!
That 4 min 2 minute drive though.
I’m a Niner fan.  And I’m glad to see Wentz playing well. Being a game manager. Making good decisions. Protecting the ball. And most importantly doing what it takes to win.
So nobody gonna talk about that thumbnail? lol
History tells us that Carson Wentz gonna get injured before the play offs, so the Colts back-up qb better be getting his reps in practice!
If the kicker makes those 2 missed FGs and one missed extra point, that last kick would’ve been the game winner.
Good game! The Colts look good! 3 wins in a row! The Cardinals need to improve! 3 loses in a row! Nuff Said!
Cards are starting to fold. Used up all of their powers at the start of the season and can't finish strong.
Cardinals are choking hard
Let's go Colts!!!
LETS GO COLTS!! I was GLAD TO ATTEND THIS GAME!! COLTS NATION CAME OUT AND REPRESENTED!!! 🔥🔥💙💙💪🏾💪🏾 #GoColts #BleedBlue #Colts4Life
The 2021 Cardinals look more and more like the 2020 Steelers.
I feel so bad for Kyler. He is such an amazing player surrounded by incompetent players and incompetent coaching.
Why did the eagles get rid of Wentz again?
and this is why despite the cardinals getting off to a great start no one was actually talking about them
Wentz is trash!  Your RB is keeping you in these games.
10:40 still don’t have Kyler Murray? What did he mean there. Was he going to say D Hop
Wentz has really been solid. Looking like he did back in his MVP race
I like the colts but just can't stand wentz. Rather any team get to the post season than him
Kliff offense is garbage
Colts o line is nasty
ive always liked the colts. how can't you!
Nice to see my Colts get all these primetime W's. They've earned more primetime games next season.
Seiously can we talk about Taylor as the league MVP???
The fact that the cardinals were that close and decided to kick the field goal with 41 seconds left...I don’t even care if statistic say that’s the move..they deserve that L just for that alone
Hi yes let’s remember that JT ran 100+ with four out of five starting lineman gone and even a back up leaving during the game. That’s elite...
Let’s goooooo‼️‼️
Y’all worried about Dak being in a slump when you should be talking about Kyler Murray
The kicker lost it for Cardinals.
Apparently the Cardinals are absolutely awful at non Sunday games.
Dez finally got one!!!!! Lmao
Colts could easily go 11-6 and secure a 5th seed. Next week we play the Raiders(it’s week 17, we know that Raiders ain’t good in late season games) at home, and then week 18 we play the currently 2-13 Jags.
How about them Colts!!!!
As a chargers fan idk if I’d wanna see the colts in the playoffs even though the ravens beat them
That thumbnail is so not PG.
Eagles biggest mistake is gonna be letting wentz go....dude is a stud💯💯
Congrats to the Colts for a well earned win here.  Gawd I feel so bad for Cardinals fans though. Losing 5 of 8, with 4 of those losses being at home, after their 7-0 start really has to sting
Great game Cards 😂....GO PACK GO!
https://youtu.be/AeLsvkWkRbQ
Cardinals still defeated at home.
Could you imagine this Colts team with a healthy Andrew Luck starting QB?
The Rams just need to Stop talking SB and like every team out there, one game at a time. Rams fan.... Good luck to every team who plays the Rams. You are going to need it.
The Colts as a team look great now, but Carson is just not going to get it done unless something changes. Most of their wins are when he throws it 30 times or less, with like maybe one outlier? Be careful against any team that shuts down the run.
Thumbnail 5:16
Arizona chokers 🤣🤣🤣
I can already see it. Colts & Vikes in the SB!
Cards need to play Colt McCoy. If Murry doesn't have Hop he's trash.
Michael Pittmannnnnn!!!! I love that man, amazing under rated receiver, i love seeing him getting more targets and seeing him succeed
Wentz didnt look terrible. Haven’t watched much of him at all this season and today he seemed to be a pretty decent QB. Staying healthy and playing well was a bit of a surprise to me. The MVP level we once saw was the outlier season, but think he’s proving that hes capable of being a winning qb when healthy. Doesn’t blow you away, but also isn’t questionable as to whether he’ll be starting games in 5yrs. I think Geoff is may be a bit questionable as to whether he can be a long term answer for any team ay QB. It’s settled w/o question that Dak is the best QB from the 2016 draft. Had a down yr and missed the pro bowl, but got his team clinching a playoff spot and likely gonna win the NFC East. Wild how unpredictable drafting QBs still is.
Looking at a Colts-Titans AFC championship game.  Tuff meets Gritty. Coach hard nose vs Coach hard nose.
Comn bro the offensive line was off today he need time in the pocket but good game
The Cardinals have shown their true colors in the past 4 games... they suck! GO RAMS!!!
Another pathetic display of the Cardinal’s tiny scrambler—Kyler Murray.  He sucks, the Cards need to find a QB that can see over the line.
The cards just crumbling
Wtf??? That was clearly a perfect catch at the end by Wesley? Both feet in and control, I don't get it?? Is everybody blind?
Cardinals and Packers have gone different directions since that fateful meeting earlier this year. A cardinal win would have bolstered them. Now they seem ordinary.
Maturing is realizing Carson wentz isn’t that bad
Anymore comments about the Rams 49er fans!?
Good teams with good defense put a hold on all them mickey mouse option throwing offenses. Im looking at you Lamar and the ravens
I think the rams broke the cardinals.
that Packers win vs the Cardinals is looking less and less impressive by the day... how do the Cardinals manage to lose to the Lions
It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish
Looks as if the Titans and Colts are headed for a 3rd game this season.
Thank you Indianapolis. Go rams!
You all acting like the Colts didn't make it to the playoffs last season with Phillip Rivers   who had better stats than wentz does now
why woudlnt they just go for it lol they basically just gave it on 3rd down what is there a 5% chance u get the onside.
Cardinals really need better O lineman a lot of times they make kyler Murray look bad but he has no time to throw
This game took a few years off my life, but it was great to see my Colts win on Christmas.
Yal wrong for the thumbnail
missing their whole o-line and still beat one of the top 5 teams in the nfl
The Cardinals coach has to be fired in the offseason or they'll just have the same type of season over and over. Kingsbury calls plays like he's playing a video game. These stupid young analytical coaches are pure garbage.
Prater sold tuff loss
Running backs have short careers because they get the crap kicked out of them that’s not going to be an issue for Taylor.
I don't know what they are paying Pitman, but it is not nearly enough.
As a Cardinals fan, I am accustomed to being disappointed after being given the slightest inkling of hope 😩
Why did the cardinals kick a field goal on third and goal?
Why did he get pro bowl over Stafford 😂
Crazy. Just watched the game and am now rewatching the recap. Some 190k views an hour after it was posted. Wild how much football peaks ppls interest.
Insanely banged up all around but the Colts found a way. Just goes to show that they can and will find a way to win against whoever they’re up against.
Cardinals are Sinking Fast they have lost a lot of games lately
As a Cards fan, all i can say is "Oh no we suck again"
That PI was a BS call
Where are all those Cardinals fans that were bragging about an undefeated season and then going to the super bowl...... Crickets?
Yo nlf some goons putting in missed field goals and pat’s for highlights😂
Wow what a great game. Honestly I'd love to see the colts make it to the playoffs but we'll see.
6:29 saw budda comin they whole way 💨
F yeah Merry Colts Christmas
Gotta ask, what the hell was Pittman thinking on that onside kick?? 1) It doesn't have to go ten yards for the receiving team to fall on it. 2) He's trying to _pick it up??_ Good way to get your head taken off -- and possibly lose the game.
Always thought Colts were dangerous. They needed time to figure it out but you could tell they weren’t playing like their record.
That's what happens when your kicker fails.
Damn colts ……
Last week : Wentz isn't the guy This week: We can go far into the playoffs !   If he isnt the guy how could he lead you to the playoffs ? And dont give me that Taylor talk. Team effort.
Y did they kick a field goal at the end ?
Wentz sure looks good Philly
Cardinals very overrated
cardinals getting exposed for the frauds they truly are
Going 11-6 no doubt. Deep playoff run, perhaps deeper. GO COLTS!!!
Cardinals pathetic
Happy for Wentz
Make me laugh. Colts think no they’ll actually reach a Super Bowl anytime soon 😂
Az needs a new kicker
I just want the Cards to win a ring
Why is arizona falling apart all of a sudden
That kicker missed every field goal that could’ve possibly won them the game 🤦🏾‍♂️, looked rigged to me
Lmao the thumbnail expresses this match perfectly
If it weren’t for the 3 missed field goals and the missed extra point, the cards should’ve won this one
I’m an Eagles fan, and to this day I feel that letting Wentz go was a mistake, but I’m really glad and happy for him to be playing the way he is, right now!!! Just the other day I saw Marcus Spears argue with Dan Orlovsky saying he didn’t trust Carson Wentz to win a game at the end! This ought to dispel that idea! Now, I know the playoffs is a whole different world, but the way these guys are playing, makes me think they can make a run in the playoffs!!!
Can’t say Carson can’t win for us
That’s a nice thumbnail
The colts offensive line is trash.
That thumbnail is just disrespectful...
Cards are frauds.
colts darkhorse
Kicker left 2 missed FG and extra point which could have won the game
Arizona was and are overrated
I knew the colts would take the dub #2
Card's kicker should be ashamed. Literally 1 thing to do relatively simple kicks for someone of that level. Shocking.
A few weeks ago someone said the cards would not win another game...it appears they were correct.
Cardinals reminding me a lot of last years Pittsburgh Steelers. Started the year of strong then fizzled out mid season. Yes they got a few injuries but there main problem is defenses figured out there offensive scheme and they haven't been to find something else that works. They better figure it out quick or they'll be a big disappointment like the Steelers were last year too
The cardinals are waiting for Dallas just to end their funk streak then lose the next game to hand the Rams the west division.
As a Niners fan I'm glad the colts won despite they had a ton of injuries they played their heart out. I still like and respect Carson Wentz as a qb. I wish we had wentz as a qb instead of Jimmy Glasspolo. Good Christmas game for sure. I'll also give credit to arizona as well they tried to come back but it was to late. Kyle Murray is a pretty good for a rookie and cards are first in nfc west. I wish the best of luck to both teams going into the playoffs.
My Colts looking good af right now! If we keep this up we could put ourselves in a good spot this year after a terrible blown 4 games we lost and should have won 🔥🔥
Cardinals are done.
There's something about the conditioning and nutrition of cardinals players the last two seasons not finishing the regular season strong or is it the coaching getting piss poor stale even though every team is riddled by COVID-19 most by injuries and or both (my Saints, Ravens, both are well coached and conditioned)
Did y’all really have to make that the thumbnail?💀💀💀
these cards are tough, but the colts are tougher
Being at the game was incredibly underwhelming. Really didn't feel like anyone was actually trying.
Colts vs 49ers SB
I love watching Arizona choke late in the season 🤣🤣 #GoRams
Good lord Wentz is garbage!
JJ watt played great
Kyler Murray's a runner.  The NFL is cursed my man, the Lombardi will never be yours.  #JustFactscardFans 😎
The Cardinals and Suns both loss today. Dark sports day for Arizona.
Onside kick and colts think it has to go 10 b4 they can scoop it up ??? What ? C'mon coach ! Come on spcl teams !
Straight disrespectful on the thumbnail SMH
Who does Carson Wentz think he is with these side arms?😭
wentz has life to him . good now that Cowboys fans don't have to be concerned with him lmao
AS A RAMS FAN THANK YOU COLTS
The Cardinals are becoming the new Cowboys. Hot starts. Talented roster. Don’t win in December.
COLTS STILL HAVE A SHOT AT THE AFC SOUTH DIVISION TITLE!!!! LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!
Is anybody going to say anything about the god-tier thumbnail? XD
Hey, LA Rams(and LA Rams fans) I know you guys already beat us in an earlier matchup in the season,l but since it's the season of giving, why not give y'all guys something to smile about during the most wonderful time of the year? Hopefully this Cardinals' loss suits you guys well.  -Sincerely, A Passionate Colts Fan    😃
5:34 terrible call
Damm.. the colts are going hard,,, the AFC is smashing the NFC this year. Lol. #Afcisalwaysstronger
The thumb nail is too much u know they have more pictures than that one they did that guy dirty... Mouth full of cup
Kyler Murray is the NEW HEARTBREAK KID!!!! SMH  😭😭😢😢😢😢 Kyler MICHAELS????
everybody's figured out how to Defense Murray.  It's over!
Two missed field goals and a missed extra point by the Cardinals kicker was the difference in the game. Those 7 points left on the board cost them big time down the stretch. When Arizona fell down by 9 points late in the 4th quarter they just didn't have the offense to come back. But you have to give the Colts credit,they played hard and Carson Wentz made the throws late in the game to secure the win for the Colts. When the Colts get some of their O lineman back they are going to be a force in the playoffs.
Another Arizona sports team collapse
Appreciate the Colts for helping the Rams out
This would have been an easy game for the Colts to throw in the towel.  They've developed a serious mental toughness in the second half of the season.
3rd down and cards kick a field goal hahah
NFL foul for that thumbnail 💀💀
NFL did AZ dirty with that thumbnail 😂😂
Wentz got all of his haters punching the air right now 💯😂
Arizona hasn't really been the same since losing to us(PACKERS)
Cardinals have been pretenders all year
That thumbnail tho😂😂😂
Colts have a quality coach & that means  a lot.
No doubt this Colts team is quite dangerous!!!
Cardinals are hot garbage LOL
NFL you grimy for that thumbnail
3 plays 2 missed field goals and a blow drive on a mutry throw yo a wide open man 10 yeards away no way
5:16, the play from the thumbnail.
My colts played a complete game with a lot of our starters out love to see it let’s keep it going vs the raiders next week
How about Pinter #63 at 7:35 for that second wind, underrated!
Thank you Colts on behalf of a Buccaneers fan
The Cards are not hungry and their defense is full of holes.  🏈👎
SB56 Colts vs Cowboys
Arizona u guys better get it together losing to the lions 🦁 u we're 🔥🥵 at the beginning I'm thinking u guys peaked too soon
No way kyler mosses that throw. To urtz on 3rd. Something dont look right to me its like yge colts being chosen to be in the playoffs.
Colts showed so much in this game. Especially in the 3rd quarter when the Cardinals had all the momentum and the stadium was rocking!! But as the game progressed the Colts slowly took it back. Colts pass rush came alive tonight and this was one of the only other things they needed to come together more to truly compete for a Superbowl. Great win
Colts should be up 11-4
2 teams going in the opposite direction. I would be happy to play the Cards in the playoffs.
Bruh this season has just been flipped on it’s head most of the way
same story of last year, when they need to show personality they just look like crap!!!!!!! kingsbury is not fir this level of this game!!!!!!!
I don’t know how Kliff Kingsbury still has offensive play calling duties. He is clearly incapable of running the offense especially against decent defenses and well managed teams. Cardinals are wasting away talent with Kliff’s pathetic and predictable offensive schemes.
Why does it suck to be an Arizona sports fan…
Pittman is insane
Cardinals always manage to shi the bed at the end of the season😂
I’m glad the Cardinals lost, but Kyler Murray can sling that ball and he got wheels. Even though they lost I hope people realize that most people thought kyler was “too small” and wasn’t going to be good in NFL. Well clearly he’s better than Baker (as they both went to same college). He showcases his arm talent way more than Baker.
THANK YOU COLTS!!!!! YOU HELPED THE RAMS, now we just have to whoop Minnesota today!
Whats with the thumbanil....
I think that might be the first time in Prater’s career that he is the reason why his team lost
Nice thumbnail
Cardinal's landslide continues.
Thank you Colts.  Sincerely, the Rams House 🐏🤘
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pittman was pooping his pants on that onside kick
2 missed fg 1 missed pat 4 first downs surrendered from penalties, 11 total penalties, a safety due to a bad snap. Can’t win like that.
Kyler Murray speed is incredible
Kyler Murray brought back down to earth --- too much hype with a few decent games now he is struggling!!
Nfl football from week to week anything can happen
That last throw by Wentz and took the hit like a Chad 🔥🔥🔥
The cardinals look like last years Steelers lol
Cardnais complete do do fart today
Isaiah Rodgers came up clutch
What’s wrong with the Cardinals!!??!? Oh my god!!
The colts would actually be scary if they had a real QB. Wentz is like the 22nd best QB in the league and always has been. Can’t believe people thought he’d turn out better than Dak😂
Not a good day to have prater as your kicker in fantasy playoffs
WOOOOOOO! #FORTHESHOE!
Glad to see Wentz having success away from the eagles he wasn't the problem
Wondering if Carson went over and hollered at Ertz.
i called it weeks ago the az cardinals were just smoke and mirrors the 7-0 record was cute though.
Colts just lurking on the Titans for the division
Where is the Cardinals running game? They were a complete offense in the first 8 weeks and now its all Murray. Injuries? Play calling? Cards are starting to slide at the wrong time of the year. Unlike the Rams who went through their slump and have come out stronger and better.
No one is going to comment on the horrible officiating?
The lions may have ended arizonas hopes…
Colts are gonna be healthy and dangerous next week :)
It's gonna be the colts in the afc championship forsure
i wonder can anybody tell me where are those Wentz hatters ?
Gimmick offenses never last. Kingsbury will be out of the NFL by 2024. Mark my words.
I have to admit, the Colts played a good game. Had a lot of there good players out, but so did the cards. Including DeAndre Hopkins and James Conner. All things considered I am not too upset with the loss since they did put up some numbers and it wasn't a total blowout.
damn Arizona y’all falling apart ain’t cha lol whelp As a Dallas fan Keep doing it lol 😂
Cards falling apart at the end of the season
For those that don't know this is normal for Kliff Kingsbury even back with Texas Tech. Good start to season and fades as the season nears the end.
Wtf was az doing in that last drive it was like they were trying to lose.
Colts qb better quick throw
Nice.  They would be a legit contender with a better QB.
colts are dumb and stupid
for the love of god nfl please make touchdown celebration dancing a flag. These grown ass men out here twerking when they get a touchdown now. SMH.
As a Tampa fan I knew the Colts were going to win this game. The cards have lost 5 of 6 now after going 9 and 0. Did they hit the Nas to early?
Feel good for Carson he won the colts this game
Very sad day today for AZ 😔
Cardinals are falling off hard
Honestly as a Cardinals fan we had this game good then the miss field goals were pilling up, lost about 7 points I think less or more. Either way this was a tuff W. We could of won but we just didn't play it right
Never lost faith in wentz. Just lost faith in my eagles. The fan base seems to love hanging under 500 for 80% of the season. GO COLTS!
6 :44 no way he just said "dicking everybody" lmao
Honestly IMO Cardinals quite frankly 1 and Done playoff Teams Lol 🤣cardinals Over Hype Hot 🔥 start and the beginning of the year now the wheels falling off and they falling off the cliff and shout out to frank
whats up with these thumbnails lately nfl
We running over everybody in our way
The cardinals have self imploded 😂😂😂
The Cardinals are slowly becoming the 12-4 steelers.
This makes me feel a little better about last week as  a Pats fan.. ..Impressive run Colts.
Kyler can’t do nothing without Hopkins lmao
LET'S GO COLTS GOT THAT W
Cardinals are pretenders. They do not deserve to be in the play-offs with real football teams. Their receivers cannot catch the ball, and all the defenses have figured out how to beat Kingsbury and Murray. Keep Kyler in the pocket with a little pressure and Kyler throws it away or takes a sack. Kingsbury's game management was awful. He kept trying to kick field goals with a guy that could not find the center of the uprights. The defense kept making stupid mistakes and that is a coaching problem. The defense is incapable of putting pressure on a third-rate QB behind a bunch of second string linemen. All the big names signed by Keim are injured. If you had looked at their history, you would have seen how fragile they were. Worn out players cannot get you to the Super Bowl. Watching the Cardinals is a painful experience. I predict they will not beat the Cowboys or the Seahawks.
They said Carson couldnt win games without an Oline lol
Colts becoming a force to be reckoned with
Cardinals are this year’s 2020 Steelers
The Cardinals playing really badly at home is a scheme for them to get a new stadium
I ain’t even know AJ. Green was in the game until that catch. But can we say Wentz is pretty good!! Also Taylor wasn’t explosive tonight. Edmonds outplayed him
Someone is getting fired at the end of the season. The SLIDE was predicted by everyone. Why is Max Garcia even at the NFL level?
Great win the colts are going to the palyoffs!
amazing how bad the kicking has become in this league
Fire th3 coach after kicking a field goal with 40 seconds left in the 4th at 3rd qnd goal like that is just bad cards deserve to lose that game
The Cardinals are collapsing unbelievable lol
So good to see the Colts winning! I hope they go to the super bowl!
Happy for Wentz.  I always thought that Philly pulled the plug too soon on him.
My Dallas Cowboys Are Truly Going To Destroy These Arizona Cardinals Next Weekend!! And I Can't Wait!! I Love My Dallas Cowboys and Am A True Die Hard Fan!! We  Got This and Are Going All The Way This Year!! This Is Our Year DC NATION!! We Are On A Roll and Headed For That Bowl!! Quest For 6 Is Coming!!
Life without D Hopkins, nobody to throw it to
What has happend to the Cardinals? They were doing so good, now they are choking up!
Taylor league MVP
Colts are catching fire at the right time.
Why isn’t odums baller ass stop in this?
Us rams exposed those cards now everybody is having a piece of the bird 🤣🤣  RAMS4LIFE
Killer for Arizona to leave 7 points on the field in missed kicks
Refs were Bribed 100%
Here's another thought...Philly is a mess and Carson goes to a team likely headed for a deep playoff run how ironic....they was bashing him calling him trash he look decent to me here letting his play talk for him
The Christmas games had the two likely MVP candidates. I think Rodgers  is ahead now but it's close.
That cardinals drive outta the half was fire 🔥
Cards are melting down right before our eyes
lion fan- what matt prater is good at is making field goals, not onside kicks.... yeah hes been unlucky but im not seeing a great bounce from him. maybe outta get him to work onn those.
Went against Pittman and Taylor in fantasy, was sweating bullets at the start… ended up with around 28 points combined points which I’ll take all day cause Taylor could easily do that by himself
Kyler Murray should have won and I'm mad!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡!!! I am so, frustrated that Kyler Murray lost!!! Worst game ever!!! What is wrong with the Arizona Cardinals??? Why???
Should have been an easy clap for Arizona. It was a rigged game as usual. Ertz should have got home field advantage calls. The kicker missed three kick's even though he can hit from 50 regularly. The in stadium bets must have been for the cardinals, and a lot of people lost. The house always wins.
I Hope the Cowboys beat them also....😁
Cardinals looking like the Steelers last year. Yikes!
Colts are definitely looking like The Dark Horse of the AFC.
*That's not same Cardinals team beginning of season*
That was an ugly win but still got it!! #COLTSGANG💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Arizona lost at home again.  They are 3-4 at home this season and it is shameful.
Who would have thought that colt McCoy would have had a better 2nd half of the season than kyler Murray
Let’s go Colts!
Booooo!!!!!
#PatMcAfee #ThePatMcAfeeShow #ForTheBrand
that's 2nd quarter was horrible to watch.   The NFL is a league of .......  I don't wanna say hahaha but how the NFL needs to change.  Just thankful the Colts won.
GOOD JOB 👍
Arizona falling apart as usual.
JEsus loves you
Micheal Pitt has been on the media a lot lately
Anyone gonna talk about the cards kicking a fg and not scoring a td
that's good defense from the Colts
The Cardinals are a team with a lot of talent but no balls.
Lol AYOO the thumbnail of this video is MAD SUS 😂😂😂
Live football is almost impossible to watch with all the commercials. I have to pause it for 20 minutes and do other things , then fast forward through the garbage.
Damn the cards kicker lost the game for them
That thumbnail tho nuts to the face n everything
Cardinals field goal kicker sucks!
I will call Murrey RoadRunner from now on. I swear I saw his legs spinning.
These Colts should be making every AFC team worry about the playoffs!
Cards: it's not the coaching. It's you guys. You started with fire and flare, explosions and Sonic booms!! Now , your playing to lose games. The Rams didn't earn first place , you guys gave it to them. The Rams went through the same thing you guys are going through. Start playing for your teammates!!
Let’s go colts
People crying talk about refs help packers i know refs miss some calls in this game refs miss calls in every game with every teams not just packers games
So happy that cardinals lost coming from a RAMS FAN . . .
Huge win for the Colts! Half the starters out and still pulled out the win.
Unbelivable that a team as talented as the Cards have collapsed. Now looking at a wild card slot, and probably one and done in the playoffs.
As a Titans fan, I am now afraid lol.
It's too bad these paid referees helped the Colts out a lot
Notice how behind an average/below average O-line JT doesn't perform as well, he was pretty much clamped the whole game other than that 40 something yard run, now see does that excuse work for Henry or not? Even in run blocking the Titans O-line has struggled pretty bad this year (which is why he has to get so many carries) im not saying JT isn't good or anything but all im saying is you take him out from behind that pro bowl line and his numbers look very similar to Henry's.
Colts are getting hot and coming together at the right time. As long as they can get and stay healthy
But I thought Wentz was washed up... NOT !!!! Haters just cant see !!!
Wentz wants a playoff run 🥶🥶
People laughed when the colts traded for wentz. Glad it's paying off for both
Man hard to believe that the Arizona Cardinals is having another rough season to finish again, and now they might not even win their own division
Now my rams are 1#
Cards really beat themselves here. well played by Wentz to close out the game though
honestly, i expected this... it's no surprise that we hold the longest championship droubt in american history, it's all the same story, either the Cards completely suck, or they get our hopes up only to shatter our hearts in the end... don't matter if Kliff is coach or not, the Cards are just a cursed franchise...
Eagles vs Colts superbowl?! Lets gooo!
I'm SICK of these lame ass unprofessional clown NFL officials. Did they remove the Holding penalty from the rule book? Half of the Cardinals long runs were because the ass hat officials NEVER call holding. So tired of seeing teams being rewarded for BREAKING THE RULES!!! 😠
Wentz for MVP> Murray !!!
Cardinals could very well lose their last two games. That would make them 3-7 after starting 7-0. I don't see them beating both Dallas AND Seattle.
Could you imagine if Andrew Luck was still on this team.
These are the Arizona Fraudinals that we are used to...hot in the beginning then fade into the sunset by the end of the season smh
Great game
Hard to believe that these are the same COLTS as week one! 🔥Congratulations!🔥
My opinion, and it’s just an opinion! Let’s go nfl!
Wilson gettin teabagged in the thumbnail
This thumb nail is great
Truly tho if Carson Wentz can play like how he did today , man no one wants to see the Indy Colts in the postseason definitely for sure , they’ve had some momentum especially with how Jonathan Taylor has saved their season
Wow, definitely a little bit different of a feel from last weeks game. With Jonathan Taylor breaking that long run at the beginning of the game instead of the end it almost felt like we were playing in The Upside Down. Going in without Nelson, Leonard, Glowinski, and Kelly was scary enough. Then Doyle, Fisher and Reed go down in the first... Colts response: Somebody let me hold a no. 2 pencil ✏ cuz they testin! And we passed that test baby. This game really showed the heart this team has and it was a well deserved win. Plus, it was great to see Jonathan get another 100 yard+ game and Wentz come through in the clutch with that last TD pass to Patmon which should finally shut up some of the critics that haven't given him much respect as of late. #GoColts #ColtsNation #ForTheShoe #Colts
As an Eagles fan, we are pulling for Carson
magnet gluvs
Add up the missed field goals by the cards and it a win !
When you are counting on a team that has dominated the league this year to beat the cancer ass colts on Christmas day...what could go wrong? Whoops too soon?
Cardinals are in big trouble. I knew they were overrated after that Packer loss
All Eagles fans Know Matt pryor is basically the derek Barnett of An O line A penalty machine
LOL it was just the Cardinals who couldn't best (beat) Mister Rodgers with a swollen Bunion hahaha  Wentz be like Matt(hew) Stafford: Until proven otherwise in Post Season...
At least the Cardinals know that Murray is not their franchise QB.  He is straight up garbage.
The colts are looking absolutely great this past three weeks. Beating the bills, Patriots, and now cardinals. Definitely a team that can make a good run.   And with the cardinals loss the rams are now the 3 seed in the NFC playoffs and leads their division. I’m having good faith that my Cowboys can beat them on January and hopefully get the 1 seed in the NFC
Haha Haha  Keep dreaming Arizona Turdinals
When you lose to the lions, you can’t expect much success
They run by Kyle Murray wow 😯
Matt Prater should be cut tonight. He cost the Cardinals a whole TD.
Last time the packer beat these lowly cardinals and people still believing the  cardinal is the better team. After today...where are those pathetic experts whom being saying the cardinal is the better team than packer?
And the Cards deflate just in time
Been a while since i seen a defense that was fun to watch… great game colts
Arizona ain’t got the strength to play in the showtime 💯.  Gooo 9Ers
Colts owe Prater and his -7 big time
Watching Budda Baker reninds me of Troy Polamalu
The cards gave me the same Christmas gift last year. Wow !!! Just wow.😣😣😣😣😣😣
Really shocked at how off Arizona has been for the last part of this year. Meanwhile Taylor killing it
That thumbnail tho 🐐
Phoenix Arizona, probably the most poverty city on earth profesional team wise 😂
This looked like a weird game to watch
The Cardinals are looking more and more like last year's Steelers.  Great start to the season, embarrassing loss to the worst team in the league, then limping towards a first round exit in the playoffs.
Colts are gonna be a problem in the playoffs
murry is MR jet I
This football is a joke, I’ve been watching sports a long long time , this is getting very bad
The thumbnail , they wild for that
The thumbnail LOL
Colts is a dangerous team if they play like this
PLAYOFFS??? PLAYOFFS???
Wentz looks good
Colts just beat the "best" team in the NFL without 10 of there starters😀😀🤣🤣
2020 Steelers: 11-0  then 12-4 and lost to Browns in Wild Card playoffs.  2021 Cardinals: 7-0 then 10-5 and it's probably will end up 10-7 or 11-6.
Solid win by the Colts.Carson made some great throws and the receivers were clutch didn't drop the ball.Even though you have Johnathan Taylor wish Carson could have audibled when the defense stacked the line.Defense played great keep on rolling Colts.
Damn the cards couldn’t do me a Christmas solid and beat the colts 😩
Arizona Fraudinals ain’t winnin shizznit.  4’ 7” QBs can’t get’r done.
The cardinals are who we thought they were, now if u wanna crown their ass then crown em. Lol 😆 but they are who we thought they were.
This is new to me I’m shock ppl where saying cardinals had it guess not 🤣
Thank you Cardinals for completely falling apart down the stretch........Signed a Rams fan.
The Cardinals have fallen and they can't get up.
i’m telling you we’re #1 in takeaways and Jonathan Taylor is the best in the rush game right now Carson and T.Y just need to show some veteranship and have some solid games and that’s a recipe for a CHAMPIONSHIP don’t sleep on the Colts!!!!!
I need every afc teams that arent a div leader to lose so my dolphins can sneak in, this doesnt help lmao
NEXT WEEK ITS OUR TURN,,, LETS GO DALLAS! WE WANT ARIZONA!!! NFC EAST CHAMPIONS!!
1:12 absolute respect for the o lineman number 79
Kicker was terrible.  ...
Lmao watch all the sports talk shows take it easy on the cardinals. Lame ass team
LETS GOOOO, I’ll have everyone know we did not have ANY of our starting offensive line AND some of our best defensive players yet we STILL won LETS GOOOO #ColtsNation
Will there u go cardinals fans
And this was without 4 starting o linemen. If they were healthy up front, JT goes for 200 and Wentz throws for 4tds. GO COLTS
Cardinals slowly turning into the 2020 Steelers
What a nice W!  I didn’t expect this at all. I love this Colts D. They are very resilient. Also, Wentz stepped up in the 4th quarter and threw two big passes, which put the game away, after an average first half and poor 3rd quarter.
Good to see Prince Harry playing well!
We had many chace to get back on track. But now, we are done.
Cardinals are collapsing like the 2020 Steelers. Do they even still lead their Division, or do the Rams have the tiebreaker?
good stuff
Cardinals are the team that we thought they were: USELESS!
That loss to the lions really did something to the cardinals
During the final play. Colts defense coordinator created a master piece blitz 😂😂😂. There was so many open receivers, but Kyle is way too short to look over the trenches.
Colts looking strong
Colts 100% deserve a better record. They got bullshited man
Go Colts!
Them Red Birds just can't finish a season.....
NFL NETWORK YOU ALL SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY TO WATCH A FUCKEN AMERICAN FOOTBALL GAME> EXTORSION>>> DONT YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY YOU HAVE TO TAKE STRUGGLING FOLKS $ TO WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME IN THEIR LIVING ROOM!!!! SHAME ON YOU>>HOPE NOT TO MANY FOOLS OUT THERE SUBSCRIBE TO WATCH>> WHATS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY??
My boy Wentz out there getting it done tonight 👌
The Cardinals are Collapsing. But we won and that matters  #ColtsNation2SuperBowl
The thumbnail is just disrespectful
Is it just me, or have I've been seeing a lot of missed Extra Points this year?
Murray is highly overrated. No way he belongs in the pro bowl this season.
The thumbnail, lol
Let’s see if the media still doesn’t talk about the cardinals losing.
The kicker should be dealt with some many misses today
FAIL MURRAY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cardinals done hit rock bottom, I don’t think no team fears them lol
The Cardinals are the NFCs equivalent of the AFCs Raiders... start the season strong and then implode😅
Keep the comments respectful yet they put that thumbnail
Cardinals fans should already be looking forward to next year you lost to a garbage team🥴
Colt good Cardinal bad
Cardinals won't go far in playoffs
These guys can actually have a shot at winning the super bowl, Indianapolis has the potential to do it
Cardinals can't play football garbage team
No Leonard, Nelson, Mack, or Ryan Kelley our center and still won. Man this team is special. Keep sleeping.
I feel like the colts are a sleeper team, they can beat anyone on any given night. Risky game for any team in the league
bruh imagine had andrew luck never retired.
Carson Wentz had a great performance for the Indy offense and the Colts defense slowed down the Cards just enough to keep the Titans from winning the AFC South title on Christmas.
Cards been Disappointing and will probably not even Win the Wildcard or there Division Idk What this team has been doing, Maybe they have been getting drunk or something who knows
Thank u colts for making the buccaneers a lock at the #2 seed with a chance for #1 and home field advantage #GoBucs
Hey Colts, your still not gonna make it far postseason. LOL
Remember when JJ Watt said "Maybe we're just better" when referring to the Cardinals? Boy have the times changed. The Cardinals are back to being.........Well the Cardinals.
SHAHT AHT COLTS D!!! 2022  INDIANAPOLIS INDIANA COLTS SUPERBOWL WINNERS BABY
Don't you worry fellow Arizona Cardinals fans, I've found a silver lining:  There's always next year ... and the year after that ... and the year after that ... and the year after that... and the year after that... and the year after that... . . . . . (I'm so pissed at my "same 'ole Cardinals")  🤦🏻‍♂️
Who picked the thumbnail bruh
What a win for Indy. Down 4 O-lineman and their best defensive player, they went into Arizona and showed they are a team nobody wants to face come playoff time. Walk it to em also had a solid game, always makes me happy to see Wentz ball out
Wientz is getting it done but dang he is hard to watch lol,  Seems like everything is such a struggle, nice win open up things for the Rams!!!
Hell of a 4th quarter for Wentz some nice throws  🔥👏👏
The Cards are on a slide
Turns out colts did a good thing taking wentz
Thanks for this gift Colts! Let's go Colts Nation!
This channel called this game!   More to drop tonight!   https://youtube.com/channel/UC2AfEsoyz4QBNrxnNHAllQA
I wish the colts loss so we could be AFC South Championship
Cardinals looking bad
The battle for AFC South is heating up! Would be nice to see both Titans and Colts make the playoffs!
Good job colts, this is almost better then when we watch the cards lose in the first round of the playoffs 🤣 all those boring lucky wins for nothing.
The Colts have kicked those Red Birds out of first place in what appeared to be "The Cardinal Division" just about a month ago!  Now the Rams can feel some relief of migraines from Head  Butting their opponents all year since Indianapolis played Santa in this contest giving Los Angeles the perfect 🎁 gift in the desert heat!!!
Both teams were wrecked with injuries and covid, helluva game and a perfect Christmas gift! Onto LV!
Mike pitt legend
Cardinals closing in on a historic collapse. You lost the division lead to the Rams and now could very well miss the playoffs... GG Colts!
Crazy to think that the cardinals started the season off 7-0. Fast forward and here they are 3-5 in their last 8 games!
the most disrespectful thumbnail in youtube history
Cardinals really been slipping of late. Prater couldn’t hit anything and it turned out to decide the game.
Kyler Murray is overrated! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 OVERRATED!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Yes, I get it, D-Hop is out. Losing to the Colts at home is one thing. But losing last week against the Lions still should've never happened! Cardinals are in trouble. Next up, the Cowboys with their healthy defense (assuming that they stay healthy a week from now). Congratulations Colts! 🎊
Thumbnail 💀
Colts are making HBO happy they picked them for the documentary
Unhappy with Murray's play of late. However, some guy said he would rather have Cousins than Murray.....I am like, you want a guy who been in the league since Andrew Luck was drafted and retired, and in that time.......has  1 more playoff win than Murray?????  Watson? Lamar? Yeah........
Cards will be making an early exit. Totally overrated I knew injuries would ruin them again I was calling it before the season began that injuries would wreck their season. That old Pottsville Curse is still killing the Cardinals.
“Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs! You kidding me? Playoffs?! I just hope we can win a game!”  - Cardinal fans
There are still too more games and Colts have the easiest schedule against the Raiders and Jaguars. Anything can happen any given week. They shouldn't give up till the last second. They deserve to be in the playoffs.
Cardinals looking mortal these days
Merry Christmas Rams fans. Thank you Colts
Can anyone plz explain, why the Cards in the Red Zone didn't go for the TD and 2 points for at least a tie?...Another frustrating loss, on Christmas Day, at home?..Sooo disappointing!!
Colts are rolling because of Hard Knocks I’ve really grown to like this team. And if I’m the Cardinals I’d get rid of my kicker ASAP lol
It's crazy the Colts won with only 1/5 starting lineman
JT IS MVP.
I swear I felt like the only person who knew the Colts were going to win today  The Cards are just not an organized team yet
Those Colts are, pun intended, the Dark horse of the AFC playoffs at the moment. The Cardinals.....well it was fun while it lasted
It's so stupid!!😡😡
We fell of so hard. Just going to be a repeat of last season
Cards say...we fold.
It’s so fun watching Kyler Murray run
At 2:15, it has to be tough for any NFL defender to catch such a small QB packet.   Bellichik took advantage of size mismatch at NE for years.
Carson wentz needs to play like this to be a legit super bowl contender. I know he can do it
To my fellow Cardinals fans, I hope this serves a reminder not to ask or beg for respect. There's a reason for it, and now they might not make the Playoffs... again.
Yo what is it with that thumbnail lmao 😆
Well done Cardinals, Rams will win the division because of you.
The Cardinals really fell off 😭😂😂😂😂
I know the cards have some injuries but so many missed FG’s and False starts 🤦🏾‍♂️
The only 2 things consistent with the Cardinals is being inconsistent and Larry Fit-...well I guess 1 thing now :(
Go colts
Final cardíaco muy buen partido
I miss wentz smh....  I still root for him tho
Colts coming back strong after a shaky start to the season. Looking more and more like a threat to the AFC playoff picture.
How do you lose to a team that have that many oline man out including the best oline player in the league
Super Bowl contenders no doubt
The Cardinals are falling apart near the end of the regular season. Another loss just puts the Rams currently in 1st place of the nfc west.
Cardinals Sucks Ass
Carson Really Showed up reminds me of his sb year
This team is the perfect example of the next man up mentality.  Just do your darn job and everything falls unto place!
Okay do the Cardinals want to go to the playoffs or not? This is starting to get frustrating.
Thank you Colts. Rams have a chance to take the 1 seed tomorrow.  Edit: 1st place in division*
Colts and packers would be a fun super bowl
It's official, Cardinals are a BUST!
As a ravens fans we got really lucky when we beat the colts these guys are nothing to play with
Cards are pretenders
Cardinals are fraudulents like I said !!!
Colts 💪
Cardinals had a chance.
The cardinals kicker should be replaced for @destroying
I’m glad the colts won! The Cardinals still did good! If the colts win 1 more game we have a chance at going to the playoffs
Colts are so much better than what people thought. Glad to see Wentz looking happy out there.  Edit: Geez la weez 25k likes!!!? Thank you all   Edit 2: Damn never mind. 25 still dope though. I think.  Edit 3: 26!  Edit 4: Who am I kidding. That last like was from me.
The Cardinals are essentially the Steelers of 2020. Tbh them and the Rams imo have no excuse for not getting in the NFC Championship. They have too much talent to go to waste, especially LA.     Besides, we all know the Green Bay Packers are gonna go to the NFC Championship and choke for the 3rd straight time.
As a Browns fan I’m rooting for the colts the rest of the way, I hope they make a great run
THRY LOST TO OUR PRACTICE SQUAD!!
I can tell the cardinals didnt listen to my son b4 the game, thats why they lost
Cots thank you for this Christmas gift
Joe Davis  IND on FOX again!
This is the best win of the season let's go colts 💪💯
What a game!!!
That’s what I’m talking about. LETS  GO COLTS!! A perfect Christmas gift. Playoffs here we come.
Cards gonna lose they’re last 2 games. Everyone licking they’re lips trying to face the Wildcard Cardinals lol
Cards are still the real deal. Packers are still going to the Super Bowl tho. Although, I wish it was 49ers.  Edit: nvm the edit.
Being able to beat that cards with no offensive line and a couple of key defensive players missing was awesome. + JT still getting 100 yards with a practice squad offensive line is spectacular, can someone say MVP?
Colts are looking good, hard to believe this team started 1-6, hope they can keep it rolling and make the playoffs
Can we stop dogging wentz, he’s having one of his best years.
Good job Cardinals! You are now the 2020 Pittsburgh Steelers!
Colts really fixed themselves. Early to midseason, they were looking very messy, but now they looking a lil nasty🤢🤮👌🏽
Cardinals had all y'all fooled, not me though. They show their true colors once again late in the year
The cards r cruel pretenders......... Proud Ramily
Everyone slept on us 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I told y’all! The cards are frauds! The colts had more people injured than us. Doesn’t help that refs are selling also, but that is no excuse!   The Fraudinals will finish 10-7 and possibly miss the playoffs. Even if they do, their bum ass are first round exits! Congrats to the colts! Y’all are dangerous team! -sincerely, cards fan since 07
That is the worst game in my life!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡
Suns and Cardinals choking.
Prater sold
I love JT man….. and this is coming from a guy who’s from Wisconsin
A huge win for the Colts. Another 100+ yard rushing game for Johnathan Taylor. The Cardinals have lost 3 in a row and the NFC West now is for the Rams’ taking.
The cardinals kicker was drunk tonight 🎄😎
That helmet looks so big on Murray.
Watching Carson Wentz throw a ball is like watching an drunk guy play darts at the bar. Not getting far with that guy lol
Man what happened to the cardinals?!
Greatest downfall in NFL history ?
A. Cards are the 2021 version of last year's Steelers. B. I am terrified of the Colts. I really don't want to see them in the playoffs.
Judge: Your word to spell is Arizona Cardinals.  Spelling Bee Contestant: Arizona Cardinals— O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D. Judge: That is correct!
Colt's got this dub for🌲❄️⛄
what a kicker! what a shame!!
If your reading this I just want to say I LOVE YOU!!!!
As an eagles fan I’m happy to see Carson doing well. He had an off year last year but he is a great qb.
That Wesley celebration tho 👀
Cardinals are the 2020 Steelers
2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION INDIANAPOLIS COLTS WINNER: CHRISTMAS 🎄 DAY
Wesbrick missed 4 layups🤮🤢
Next man up! LESSSSGOOOOO COLTS!
Gotta work on those two sacks tho
Thank you Colts   -Rams
Was it just me or did the cardinals kicker and other players looked drunk out here on the field tonight?! So many plays that should have been made tonight!
Cardinals are pretenders sadly😔
Cardinals are TRASH!!! AZ College teams can beat them!!!
Cardinals are overrated they are losing to teams they should beat
Let’s go!!!!!
BWAHAHAHA! Cards fans now know what it's like to be a Hawks fan this year!!!!
Cardinals are like the 2020 Steelers
The baby houses vs the pretty birds
Thank you colts for putting the Rams in first👍
Go colts!
Work
Cardinals need to resign Larry legend
cardinals in shambles lol
Watch the Cardinals bounce back next week and beat the Cowboys. I can just feel it right now. 😀😀😀😀😀😀
The Colts may not win their division this year but they are starting to resemble one of the most dangerous teams in a stacked conference
Cards are frauds, coming from a cardinals fan
The Colts couldn't have picked off a right time to get hot! I'm nervous about this team. They beat us after all.
Merry Christmas 🎄 Go Colts!! 🔵⚪️
If Carson Wentz can play like he did today, this team is gonna be scary in the playoffs
Colts are for real
4th?
THATS IT. COWBOYS ARE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL
Cardinals are frauds
Kyler Murray is so overrated as a QB…without DeAndre Hopkins he just ain’t that good and the Cardinals actually played better with Colt McCoy
Colts: Ajax!  Cardinals: AS Roma!
The Colts have been looking very solid lately. They can go far if they continue to play like this.
The Arizona Fraudinals
The Colts are for real and this is coming from a Patriots fan!
