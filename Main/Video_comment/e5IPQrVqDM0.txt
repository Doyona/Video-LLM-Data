Man I'm kinda bummed out because I realize that LeBrons getting old, even though he still has his head at the rim sometimes, blocking shots going up like he did vs the mavs last year, on that first oop I feel like 2013 LeBron woulda stuck his elbow in the rim, granted that was 9 years ago but still😂😂😂
4:10 Isaiah Thomas’ reaction to this is pure gold 🤣
1:25 Chet injury for those who are curious
proof seattle need a team

F LeBron
Can't stand that egoistic Lebrun.
Year 20, a billionaire, and still humble enough to play in pickup game leagues like these despite his status!  Let's appreciate LeBron!   Doing it for the love of the game. Real hooper.

Is anybody gon play defense?
Screw crybaby China James.
They slippin on the court like some golf movie rain day advantage lmao

Nobody cares about Joker james, and his crybaby career. There are way better plays in the past now and future. He is just a rich BLM Domestic Terrorist
When lebron slammed the ball down effortlessly and dj tried hella hard but it still wasnt cool as lebrons 😂😂😂😂😂 0:44
Where’s Anthony Davis?🤷🏾‍♂️🤔
All That money in the building And The couldn't had a bigger vendor
The line up is good I don't know why they didn't come so prepared a lot of people wants to watch it so bad ... specially that Tatum and lebron is on the same team
Bum facility
4:37 kid learned today why NBA players don't get in LeBron's way
They was walking past Jason Tatum like he was G league
i enjoyed the episode & y’all funny! Can’t wait  until the next one hahaha Lol⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.
Where was this Tatum in the finals?
Did Adin Ross commentate this game or is it just me ?
Seattle you had one job, get the AC to work 💀
Tatum was playing Steph Curry in all star game
If everyone watching in the gym would've stopped breathing so DAMN HEAVY mb the court would've been straight.  Mf's apparently needed mops on the bottom of their shoes to play safe.
Lakers could’ve got Tatum to go along with Lebron & AD. They blew it big time 😭
This was legit embarrassing. I was there since 7am and waited in line about 20 ft from the entrance. Then you got these people who come 30 min before entry and CUT EVERYONE IN LINE. It was sooooo unorganized. They need to be better orepared, that was some bull
As someone trying to attend this event as a Seattle local, gaddam it was disappointing all the way around. From the disorganization in the line before the game, it was pure chaos from at least 10am to 2pm before the police started to tell everyone they were at capacity and go home, to the game being canceled, most disappointed I've ever been in my city.
Meanwhile AD playing videogames at home..
you got LEBRON JAMES pulling up to ur gym and ur AC not working?? shame on u
tatum now has finals experience, i think we'll see him in peak next season.

Jordan would’ve never
That JT to Bron lob was tuff
I feel bad for Paolo it was hot asf and he already got that sweating condition
lebron to tatum : come to lakers u joining us
BILLY GOAT....IN THAT ORDER....EAT YOUR HEART OUT MIKE....HIM DIFFERENT....BLACK WIFE ....GREAT SONS....
Jamal gotta do better than that. Shit a hot ass mess
Is playing defense against the rules in this league?
Tari Eason tho
Chet made 1 defensive play and said yeah it's been almost 2 months this is beneath me
Lebron James IS HIM 💯🙏🏾🔥
One thing bron and Tatum have in common is to lose in the finals against the same team
Love seeing I.T playing ball.
Feels like lebron playing in the 90s with this competition.
Good to see IT out there
Seattle cuttin up!!
No AC! All them people in there, mfers slippin and shit. Come on man everything shoulda been checked off the list with this event
hey repent  here repent what this means is give your life to Jesus and turn away from your sins and you will be saved and the blood of Jesus will get you to heaven
Light skinned Kobe raining 3s
Lol so Tatum just took pull up shots the whole time?
Good for LBJ and Jason Tatum to show up and play and allow some of those kids who can't get to an NBA game.
4:35 - that weak ass reach in 😂
Lebrooooon
check out my music a single dad at 20 Tryana be a great
Lezgoo
The number 12 on 4:36 LMAO 🤣
Typical Lebron has his team stacked lol wasn’t real work
Any NBA player could "go stupid"in these games
I.T on the opposing team?🤨
TDG #1 FULLSUPPORT  👑 LEBRON JAMES OF THE NBA  BIG FAX
Somebody was hating. Ain't no damn reason the AC wasn't on C'mon now. This was a huge event and the lack of air conditioning shut it down? Not a good look SPU. The King was in the building c'mon.
0:43 the follow up, is that who i think it is? 😂
“Dribble these cheeks bugs”
lmao...white people can't get that experience in the hoax neighborhood
Why was Crawford pissed at the beginning I heard someone pull the fire alarm is that true?
Another “Undisputed" episode!👍🏾 “Come on Skiiiip!" - Shannon Sharpe 🤣
Lebron tearing up the summer league games
My man with the mop on the baseline working overtime
That JT side step so deadly and look like I.T was quiet in this game lol now that the big guys around
The goat
Epic fail
They need to do this at Climate Change Arena if possible in the future.
This is why every single last one of LeBron's h8rs truly don't matter. He has so many more who appreciates him for who he is, and what he's accomplished. #built2Blegendary💪🏾👑
that ball was wackin mf’s in the head that were standing behind the rim, some hard bounces from the rim 🤣. & JT got busy from 3
I love the fact that LeBron still bring the ball down in this kind of games. I played a lot of hotshots divas that think bringing the ball down is beneath them.
Cj elleby.. lol
We need a team dawg😤
Lebron acting like he don’t wanna look at the camera 😭
Omg, that LeBron slip stopped my heart! I was thinking & probably so was he...there goes the 2022 season.
You can’t have a free event without a capacity limit and comfortable conditions.
Bro how did the floor get to slippery
4:24 off left foot catches & finishes one-handed with the left lol
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.
This is why you can’t have so many people in these small gyms make them pay and have a capacity limit, players sliding around the whole game
Lbj
Paolo got worse D then Harden!!!! He been embarrassed so much this summer!!! How he picked 1st
Chet gonna get bullied on D all season
No matter how much u hate him u gon appreciate him when he gone... this is coming from a former lebron hater myself 💪
Gotta wax dat floor Jamal
damn they didn’t let me in i was there for a min n they said full capacity 😞
J Crawford pissed off 🤣
When Lebron entered the gym tho
4:02 if Lebron did this the court would have shut down
W
My god Tatum hit like 5 threes in the first quarter lmao
it was a mess event 🤦🏼‍♂️
Paulo out there going against three nab all starts in a promo game before he play a minute in the league....
This game was ass to even post
LeAdam saw all those dudes slipping and sliding on the court so he made that call like "GET EM OUTTA THERE" 🤣
Nba players got beat?
Dick eating is crazy
Announcer: I kno it’s hot but there’s a reason for that
Horrible conditions to play basketball. I still can’t get over the mf who missed a wide ass open layup 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro it’s getting random at this point like why are nba superstars pulling up to play against drew league competition
I can't believe they didn't put new wax on the floor before they started the whole event. Everybody was slipping and sliding everywhere 🤦🏿‍♂️
Meanwhile, Euro players are going crazy in international competition against real basketball players.
Bro how they gonna organized a game like this and don have the AC working.
Lebron suck lol
Paolo got low key shit on and went 0/10 bc of jayson Tatum…Chet stopped and tipped Lebron on a FASTBREAK but rolled his ankle in the process in the first min of the game. IT did great and Jayson Tatum dominated and this is coming from a warriors fan,it was almost like Murray and paolo were not even there..
That’s why Jayson could win the finals TOO DAMN SELFISH & WANNA BE THE SHOW AKA CENTER OF ATTENTION 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️… Like pass the ball they not there for you bro it’s LEBRON JAMES that got the place packed out… That’s why he not a superstar to me his very overrated 💯
That announcer is Legendary! 👂🏽💯
Man they put on a show for 30 minutes until everybody got fatigued over the AC not being on , you dont want nobody getting hurt frfr cramps lead to injury obviously the casual wouldn't understand that
Why game end early everyone good?
why does Pulao alway get dominated  bruh
Bum ass courts 🙄
They ended the game cause the floor was to wet
Paulo probably was sweating something crazy
I live in Seattle
That game was terrible. Lebron had San Antonio flashbacks and ended the game.
W
Hey
Why did it end early
Really wanted it to carry on
Lebron def gonna request Tatum now 😂
Yessir
