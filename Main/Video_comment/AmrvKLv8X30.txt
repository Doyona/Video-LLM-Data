Sadly we live in times where interests are more importmant than humans lives for others 😢

Hello nas daily tell the composition of solution and also spread awareness so if we get a chance we can  also do like marino u must tell the solution composition and chemistry of what substances with which the lake was contaminated is that solution useful to all lakes across the world??? Please clarify my doubt if u read my comment And make sure u dont do any mistakes like this in future videos  i mean provide full information about the thing u are speaking.
We don't need more people like Marino,we need to be like him
San marino!
Wow this guy’s name is even Marino! It’s like his parents expected this XD
Hello Nas... I m from India (Mumbai). If I want to purchase this solution from where I can get this ? Is it available online or how can I get contact number of it's seller
Lol like anybody has time for that and if ur so desperate do it yourself 😂
I need this, can I buy one? A lake near my house is disgusting and killing a lot of animals. Everyone stays away from it. Even the other species.
India's Ganga River needs him..
I met Marino 5 years ago because he is peruvian like me and well, yeah, this solution are many nanoparticules that trap pollution. He studied in Japan and that solution was not unknown at all. He just brought it here to Peru and tried it in one lake, ONE! We have thousands of polluted lakes. Anyway, that solution costs millions to use/produce so, the lake is polluted again and he doesn't use "the solution" anymore so...I guess, nothing changed.
There is a reason why he is called “Marino”
Lake:I hope I grow😁 Nas:make the World a little bit cleaner Eight year old me:what why a little bit why not a lot more cleaner
Good
What we say: "We need people like her/him"  What actually we need to say: "We need more to be like him/her"
What's the ingredient s?
Bro his name is ironic because it's sounds like marine.
What solution he made,is something magical💫💫 Now I am curious to know the composition of it...
Wow,,, nature protectors are also present
Same powder used in Iraq oil spills.
What's the name of the solution?? How could I support him??
Why did the birds came back they will poop and the people's are swimming🏊🏊🏊🏊🏊
How it is possible? What is the solution? We have lot of dirty ponds in West Bengal, India. My aim is to clean all the dirty ponds. Can I get his contact no?
What is the name of that Solution or the formula?
We need that solution here in the Philippines bruhh.
What about the dirty things on top?   Edit: I also feel like helping. :)
Want to contact Marino.
In India, during lockdown period ( Covid-19 era ), many dirty lakes and rivers got cleaned themselves, no human interventions were done, so if we leave them alone, without interacting with them or littering in there, it can clean itself.
Marino casually creates the world changing invention and barely anyone knows until this is posted and ps how does it taste
Brilliant idea

Legend
FLAMINGOS
For his work in Peru, Morikawa used ceramic biofilters that he produced by himself in local pottery courses. While it took Marino six months of research to develop the nanotechnology system, the practical application went comparatively quickly: In just 4 months, he had decontaminated the entire wetlands.
This is amazing. How can we contact Marino and get his solution?
No we need people to respect and care for the land borrowed to us so people don’t have to fix what others have broken
It was so green I thought it was grass

wtf is in this magic edible solution that it can somehow clean all polutants in a lake? it's going remove heavy metals? have you ever tried to maintain a pool? multiple that by like 10,000. this souds like pure bs i am sorry. i know i woukdn't eat lake cleaner. all natural can mean almost anything. aresenic is all natural.  sounds like he is a peruvian eco snake oil salesman
If it is real, kudos to him. But i wouldnt trust someone who says “it is edible because it is organic”
The painted lady thanks you
Brilliant
Wow... this is amazing... Now ppl don't 🚫ruin it!

Cool
Don't say we need more people like Marino, say I will be like Marino !
That is an oat sponge that absorb dirt lol
Yep thats the guy in the naruto season 1
The fact that his name literally has marine in it
what did he put in it?
How does this powder work? Does it get rid of both organic and inorganic contaminants? What is the cost of making it?
#teamseas
Mark Rober showed off one where the dirt sunk
Can u pls tell the solution he used
Your right
This guy needs to meet Mr beast and his #teamseas team
Vv apt name he has🔥🔥🔥
I want the solution to clean my lake where can I find it please tell me
Haha he is supporting team seas
What is that solution called
Noice
you can eat it"  turns into a eco friendly
WOW, SO AWESOME !!!
I mean like,it's good but I don't understand how he cleaned the lake.I know he sprayed the solution all over the place and it attracted the contamination to the top,but the solution doesn't destroy it.And I know for a fact someone didn't come over and start eating it.So I'm guessing someone would have to come around and collect it manually.
Indonesia needs this.
I like this video ever is from earth I gives a full of stars for making the water clean
#teamseas
many say we need like him But legend say we need to be like him
Ok that is it we really need this solutions

Hate to be the party pooper but the government is already planning to steal it and if he doesn't comply they'll kill him and then they won't let us use it cuz they like to keep us dirty and in a state of want, so they can keep I hate to say  it but control

True member of teamseas
News are updated n bullshits but not this kind of things .. so weird
I thought the lake before was grass
Question: all the contaminated particles go to the top? So how do you get that out? Is there just a net used or smth?
at the start it took me a hot minute to realise that it wasn't land from far away it was dirty water
Is it just me, or is him name perfectly fitting
If you want to keep cleaning the oceans, then support #teamseas by going to the website and donating! 1 dollar=1 pound of trash removed from the ocean!
There are many people like this but the world doesn't give them a chance to shine.
Respect🙏
that's cool ☺️

Flocculent is a common aspect in removing contaminants & reducing turbidity (essentially how opaque the water appears) but bacteria still needs to be balanced to keep people from getting sick  Still, way to go, Marino
Great respect from India to Marino 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Yo i seen a country with his name the countrys name is San marino
Don’t think ‘we need more to expletive like Marino’ think ‘I should be more like Marino’

Wow Mashallah God gifted man with incredible intelligence
Beautiful!
He's so handsome😍
What if he shared this solution with others
INDIA needs this solution badly and other countries who have polluted lakes or rivers. Oh my..I adore this man more than my five little toy poodles.
Wow..he's of Japanese descent I think...japan is a clean country. Even the under privileged neighborhood looks great. We should learn from japanese technology where they make most things in great condition even in automotive technology.  I am happy that a lake like that is clean now and is ready to use by people.
Now Marino, is truly a person worth praising.  Thank you Marino. I hope that my children and children childrens can add to what you have accomplished.
Now if only someone could clean up the plastic like that.
Thanks Merino for your tenacity. You took on an unbelievable challenge and won🌈✨💪✝️ Congratulations for being a Hero🌹
Forward this video to your government's office mabe it will go viral.
How do you get that solution?
Woowww..amazing!!
I thought it must be possible to precipitate various detergents and soaps out of water before it gets to the stream
Yes, brilliant mind and good idea. We do need more people like him. So the hundreds of thousands of dollars we are wasting he would be able to successfully get the job done ✅. Without spending so much money 💰. Maybe he can help other organize there city and state waters.❤️with so many polluted water around the world 🌎. He turn the lake cleaner and just 🤔think what more he can do. How much help he would be.
Wow!!! How do I invest? Beautiful results in reversing manmade damage to our beautiful home. This needs to be everywhere!!!
I found that Jesus Christ is Lord.
I would like to work with you Marino... Please, how do I get hold of you?
How we kan bye this poweder  ??
Yeah - but did he address the source of pollution? Clean water ain’t gonna work unless the cause is stopped
This should be an ideal to follow but he discriminates filipinos.
So why not tell us just what his solution consit of so we can all clean our lakes!!
If u think we need more people Like marino, then you should have gotten the name of the solutions so we could all partisipate. The most important info we need in order to do like marino is for u to have given us the name of the solution in order to do like marino.
You would have done better if u would have given us the name of the solutions , so we could do Just like marino.
IT would b nice if u gave the name of that solutions so we can get together and make this happen and take this to a higher level.

This is wonderful, but what happened to the dirty solution after taking it from the lake? Is the world cleaner or just LOOK cleaner ??
Why doesn't the government promote his formula to an international level and give a little bit of fund from each country so that he can save the whole world from turning into Mars!
A TRUE HERO! He should be able to go ANYWHERE on the PLANET and have ANYTHING he wants for him and his family for saving our OWN lives by doing this with the precious little water we have on our planet.
Where can we obtain his solution.
Marino is a hero. A Superman. He looks so simple.
I read a lot, but they hide the cost.
Wow that's good to buy 10k ton to put it in the dirty Pasig River in Philippines
Can it cleaned up the  oil spill recent oil spill??
Unlimited Kindness is on the way to U
I’m scared for this mans life.
He should get a patent for that product sell or free to other countries. He deserves great recognition.
And how, where, can we get some?
Need to try that on that Nevada lake where California stole or cut off the water
How do you keep finding all these wonderful people. Why doesn't the evening news tout these great accomplishments instead of stories of miscreants and n-er-do-wells? You inspire us all to be better humans.

The rich scumbags don't want this..
The question is. How much money that marino has spend to make his solution completly work.
Where do he dispose the waste tho? It will go away naturally? Btw that's a amazing work but I'm curious about the separated waste disposal
Marino is a Japanese citizen who lives here. Japanese are one of the greatest scientist in the world who are creative
How to contact him

This young man should be in charge of our environment

Wait….if the dirt floated to the top where did the dirt go? Also I find it weird that his name is Marino like marine as in water and he happens to come up with this? Come on! This seems very fake.. plus doing an entire lake with organic powder seems pretty pricey so this seems fake

Just because it's organic doesn't mean it's safe to eat
THANKSGIVING
Protect Marino at all costs…..
Why are we not funding this?
The real question is:     *Does it taste good?*
How can we be like marino if we don't have the solution? Will he provide or will there be any organization or even government to support his successful research?
OMG
We need that powder immediately 😭❤️❤️
Not "the world A little bit cleaner" , The world became more healthy!

John 4:9,10 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, how is it, that thou being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  10 Jesus answered and said unto her, if though newest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; though wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee living water.  Jesus will give you life that comes from God and it will never run out. Just call on Him and ask Him to be your Lord and Savior. Ask Him t give you a heart of flesh and the Holy Spirit. He wants you to see and receive the love of God.

Come to malaysia to clean our lake , ask my goverment to pay for you 😂 i love a beautiful nature and what u did with your lake
This doesn't fix the dirty lake; this just gave it another cause to get dirty again.  The Way to fix it is not to let the people use the lake as a dumping site.  Natural causes can also be a factor, though.
So it also a food for fish
And it makes me mad that the world wouldn't -(not everyone Appreciate these people to make the world better   they prefer to be blind for their own goods...  They don't want a solution.

who else thought it was land before?
He is a hero
Why isn't India doing this. They are the dirtiest country in the world
Yo can you actually eat that it looks like salt
I’m sure it took some serious cash to produce all that organic cleaner. As well as labor to produce and labor to build the machinery and take care of the factory. AS WELL AS labor to distribute it all over the lake and remove any contamination’s.  So it’s not like on his weekends off he cleaned up this lake. His invention is interesting and I’m wondering what it’s limitations are.  He did a great thing, no doubt, but what better way not to have to pay for advertising than clean a lake. Sure there was tax cuts and other incentives.
I need this for burigonga in Dhaka
What he added in the lake to clean the water
I live in peru
yeah see you in another minute *swipe up*

How do we buy the product or use his method to clean lakes in srilanka
If we don't protect nature, then we won't protect ourselves.
One way i think we should do this is we could make a helicopter go over a dirty lake and we could just pour gallons of Marino solution in a lake
Wonderful you found Marino and show to us.  But for me is impossible have this kind of thought. if is this product save to eat, them perhaps I eat it in order to have all kind of impurities linked to him, all way down.  Down because if It passed the stomach, there's a lot to clean.  What do you think ?
We need this in India to clean all the holy rivers
If I eat that will it clean my dirty mind?
Salute to this man ❤❤❤

My dad found a very similar chemical solution way back in 2006 . It attracts the contaminations to the surface and also he used a manual metal nets for cleaning swimming pools and for water treatment plants...it was his business. Unlike Marino my dad couldn't use it for the social benefit as our govt. Permission is not that easy to obtain here in our lands.

I’ve actually seen (watched his story and the full vid) he’s honestly one of the biggest influencer in my life and I think back occasionally to the video and remember that there are ways to save the environment, even if it’s little by little
that man is literally a genius. it’s fully organic and cleans dirty water in minutes? einstein he’s gonna surpass you someday
If god saw this he would be proud and maybe bless him because he cleaned he's makings
I hope this works at Tietê river        (Brazilian joke)
So we gonna waste so much money for little bit clean earth it will imedeatly turn dirty again??
This guy always finds the best in people. Keep up the good work
I’ll give this guy 1M for all his solution, then I’d get a plane and drop it all in the lakes, all across the globe
I'm from Perú and i hasn't hear about he before, is really sad how he isn't a National proud yet
What an awesome man. Did he share the recipe of the mixture with the world or not I wonder
How u get a powder? And does it effect fish...becoz  there is lots of fish in village pond...doing it for charity 😀
I am in love

Oh no people came back too
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Clean water=Better life🌊🌬
Yay
What does that solution made of? And also how it taste like? Lol
I was worried because typically these compounds have secondary effects that can negatively affect the ecosystem, but the fact that he made it completely organic is just amazing
Looks like a Japanese to me
Our nasty lake here in 'clearlake' needs that our lake smells horrible
VAMOS PERUUU!!!🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
Amazing story bro,and yes we do need more people like you in in our world
He says you can eat it because it’s organic but like.... so is cyanide
Can it clean me dirty mind?
We definitely need more people like Marino
The Hudson is gonna be a challenge
Somehow I call him Mario
Someone make a clone machine 😂
What was the name of that substance?
“Marino” means “Marine” in my language.
Yes 😘😘😍😍
He should commercialize his solution
If true I am witnessing a miracle that makes me question those in power. But the before and after shots do not line up with the coastline/city scape? 🧐
In Brazilian portuguese ocean is mar and marino its a name That's look like ocean man
He deserves fame and recognition.. Good job 😊
👍🏻🍀
He is awesome dude
That guy is a pero (pro)
Florida could use this right now. A Phosphate place called Piney Point has been dumping in the gulf for over a decade and we are getting super extreme red tide right now. Mammals like dolphins and manatees are drowning because it’s effecting they’re nervous system so they can’t go up to the surface to get oxygen. There is over 800 tons of dead fish washing up on the shore. We can’t fish rn so a lot of seafood places are losing business, over millions of dollars we are losing for our Economy. This place that dumps has literally had a leak that got into the aquifer( which many counties where I live get there drinking water from) in 2016. People are just now speaking up about it. They claim they cannot stop the leaks so they just shove the radioactive water into dirt and make giant mounds. There are currently over 10 around Tampa and Saint Petersburg. I can’t stand to see all the life taken from the ocean. If we could produce a massive amount of what this man has made we might be able to actually lessen the impact it’s made from going further and effecting the ocean forever here. If only the government could pay this man to get workers and a factory so we could fight against this unnatural red tide!
Love his accent
What a good boy😙
We need that in the netherlands
I wonder how it tastes like
Yo his name is Marino because in Spanish the word Marino is similar to water or something like that
Wait what still of swim did he use?
Plz send me the solution name.
At this point this is more of an advertisement channel than motivational
The scientist:Hi! My name is Mario My brain: WTF! His name is Mario?
Wow we need that on our Ilog Pasig!
Of course the guy who cleaned a lake has the name Marino how ironic
I wish there are thousands of people like marino
where can i get it?
What is that organic chemicalia is
Can marino let me know what that solution is... I'd like to clean a pond nearby. 🙃
😍
Wow 👏🏼👏🏼
I want it I wanna eat it
Amazing video love from india
Hey marino give us the recipe
So how do we get more people like Marino?   Here's one I could think of. Not by making education accessible to the people, but by doing the opposite and make schools an option.  By reducing the amount of poor people in this world, more people like Marino will pop-up.  That is, if they aren't bad.
Is his solution is as organic and environment friendly as Amway's products?
Gooooood satisfying
What's his full name? What happens to the contamination when it floats to the top? How do you properly dispose of the contaminants? One minute was not enough time.
Plus this is solving world hunger because you could eat it
* The birds came back *  Lake: * Happy noises *  * and the humans did too *  Lake: here we go again
He makes my day perfect every time I watch him
Mussolini would be proud of him
Me imaginating the process like:  25 Health Streak! Tactical Nuke ready.  Tactical Nuke Imbound!  Did it hit? Fuck yea it did
"Because it is 100% organic" So is Arsenic.
My world a uuhhhh,my world is not fucking clean
And the ppl dirty it again

Him:"We need more people like Marino"  Me:"We need more people like who you found."
That's awesome 👌
Hmm 100% organic... plastic is organic too and so are flocculants
What does he mean by little bit cleaner we should make it full clean
Wait.. does that mean you can eat all organic things? I think I'm loosing sight of what organic means.
Wonderful
Does it taste good?
What is this solution name
GOD BLESS HIM👦👏🥺😊😇
👏👏
Marino literally means something that comes from the sea, in my language
Cool dude
Him: the bird came back and the human me:
Hes giving me a japan vibes
🙂👍
Technology is so cool
So how do we get his solution to clean lakes, ponds near us
Lake maridoth needs thia
What's the solution called? How to get and reproduce? If we can do this everywhere, we can avoid a water crisis
Que hermoso
We don't need people like Marino but his solution more
So can the Ocean society people reach out like does it work in n oceans? Cause man we messed up that water ! I would so be willing to help pay for that!
If you eat that your poop will be half brown half colorless
thats a lake?!??!! i thought that was a god damn no forest grass walk
He is a hero
My dad who is Peru lol
The moment I saw "And people did too." I was like This is gonna be like the old one again. Not to mention: The government doesn't even care about their lakes, they expect other people to clean it. I'm pretty sure they didn't even reward him. Even though, he didn't do that for any reward. He did it so the lake can be clean again. I feel sad for his money.... People will be the same: in the 1st day: "Oh!!! Look!! the lake is clean!" the 2nd day they won't care about the lake anymore, they'll probably keep trashing the lake. I've already lost hope in our society. Only if heroes like him increased in number... Or maybe the government gave a poop about their dirty lake.
Imagine what kind of body's he finds
Fish lake by my house is so green its gross
Where can I buy the solution I want to clean my village lake
o my god .god bless you man..
"... so did people."  Ah shit, here we go again.
5 years ago.... Cloning machine? I don't need that anymore  Now....... WHERE IS THE CLONING MACHINE WE NEED TO MULTIPLY THIS MAN SO WE CAN BRING BACK THE FLAMINGOS
Hats of to this dude 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You people need more Marino so that you can keep on continuing contaminating the lakes? No need of Marino! We just need to be aware not to contaminate any natural resources
Wow. Ilog Pasig’s solution ! Where’s the Filipinos at ?
The fact that his name is Marino makes this 10x better.
Please tell me that you purchased the dirty, contaminated Lake first...
I wonder how it tastes like 🤔🤔🤔
I like things cleannnn
I want to be as smart as Marino great solutions bring great results 👏🙂
But it literally just puts the dirt on the floor. If you agitate the water the dirt will come back
“Hey marino?” “Yea?” “I’m bored wanna go clean the whole ocean nearby” “I already did it” “Oh well what about the whole world” “Done.” “Bro wdym it’s still dirty loo- oh you really did”   How I imagine a conversation with this guy would go
Marino: means sailor. It was his destiny
Yes only 4 easy payment of 39.95 for a whole lake supply call now operators are standing by,Free shipping
India could really use this for Ganga lol I'd imagine they'd need to coat the  whole river on a pretty much minute basis
"I want youuuuu ,I need youuuuuuu"🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Give him the award for World Peace, if anyone can make peace with Nature like this it's incredible.
We can make our blood clean
Genius❤❤❤❤
Its good that its organic and makes the contamination float but this kind of stuff has been around Mark Rober did a video on the OG stuff and using it to make drinkable water in Africa
Itsa me Marino!
Looks kinda like pink flaky salt
I kinda want his study just for my rrl in research
Great . Salute to this scientists ....
We want this solution to clean our river Ganga ✨
It's not "We need more people like marino" It's "I'm gonna be like marino"
THIS IS THE PERSON FOR WHOM YOUTUBE SHORTS WERE MADE
He looks like Asian
Is about fucking time we start making videos like these go viral
Love it
*Its a me Marino*
El lago está sucio: El lago se limpia Vuelven los animales: Vuelven las personas: Las personas ensucian el lago: El lago está sucio:
In india Ganges calling u bro.. Ppl makes her so dirty
Marino did a very good thing we need to be like him...
I like that he said the word "a little bit cleaner"😂
🖤🖤
He just ate it lol
Is it just me but after he ate it I want to buy it to eat it 😂
*He has a unique solution with a unique voice in my opinion*
Yep
He can earn a lot with that powder
When you said  *PERU* , this makes me uncomfortable.
Omg 😳
Yes we real do need more people like him
no one: marino : *waters the lake
His name matches with his project
Malaysia need this~
MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE!
My concern is he worked hard , did miracle... U just searched for him nd did money... Good
He said that he want all people to do this but he didn't even give us the ingredients to make it...
I FOUND A SCIENTIST IN PERU
HE ATE -
Him: We need more ppl like Marino Me: why can't he just sell his potion thingy 👽
This should be more promoted.
The dude looks Japanese.
For god sakes PLEEEASE PLEEEASE clean Galveston beach 🏖️🥺😂
I couldnt even tell where the "lake" Was at the beginning
Go Go Marino!!!!
So I can eat snake's venom cuz it's eco friendly
"we need more people like marino"   no, we need to be like marino.
we need that in the Philippines, im surprised no one has done that yet
we need this one for the rivers and lakes in the philippines
We need more people like Marino☑️ We need to be like Marino ☑️ We need society to be like Marino also yes☑️
It should come to India also because there is so much dirty water people can't drink that so 😞😞
Never mention recipe🤔
This could contribute immensely to saving our planet wtf why isn't he famous??
Guys HIS FREAKIN NAME IS MARINO..as in MARINE-O.

Indian need his solution ....I'm Indian
Does it work in salt water?
How to get found this type of facts? please tell me 🤔🤔
it's look like oat
Damn I wanna try and eat it to see how it tatses
After he said you can eat it I was like "where do I find this stuff I wanna eat it "
E.coli is 100% organic too but you don't see me eating shit.
I like how he said "a little bit cleaner" meaning that cleaning lakes aren't just enough to stop pollution.
Here comes the swan
the fact that the before lake does'nt even look like a lake but more like a grassey ground
next thing you know when you eat it blood comes from your mouth because it goes to the top
At first we should clean our dirty minds....
Ppl came back too...so he should to clean it up the next day..
Ok, where can I buy this
He should open a buisness to sell these organic product
Can we use this in rivers too? My country has a lot of dirty rivers and it would be great if it got cleaned up with this
Where can I get this product?? :0
Wait I thought the water that flamingos stand in was highly toxic and that guy was casually swimming in it
was that formula made open to public?  anyone has any link?
The background of the lake changed
Kinda wanna do that to the Mississippi River
“His solution is so eco friendly you can eat it!” It probably won’t taste very good
Yeah you can eat it because it's dried oatmeal and bran flakes mixed with some dried Ginger
😁
That’s it the they are gonna come for him and  assassinate him…
At first I thought it to be bored but after that was 😎

To the people saying that it already existed, you don’t understand the difference. This doesn’t harm water like other stuff.
Him:we need more people like marino  Me:just clone or ask people to be like him
"We need people like Marino"  No. We need less people who contaminate the lake in the first place.
it's a shame we seldom hear any news about wonderful & important things done for humanity by people like him we just got lucky to come upon this instead it's mostly Kardashians or who's mad because they were called the wrong gender..
Awesomeeee
Well holphly its lake Michigan is dirty by east side Chicago
I guarantee that cures diseases.   This is genius
That didnt even look like a lake
Whoo!you did one about my dad's country.
Not one minute
Marino is fuckin amazing
This is really cool , thank you for taking time to create all these educating videos for us
ARRIBA PERU
Ok he says we need more people like maruno but he doesn't tell us the solution so we can use it aswell..
People from Southern Asia throwing rubbish intro rivers and lakes: Finally, a worthy opponent!
Muscles will clean dirty water too.
Juss tell us fucking solution man🙄
“Sadly, Marino died shortly after this video by poisoning”
The fact that his name is Marino makes it even cooler
Him: birds came Me: that nice Him: people also came Me: your hard work is going to die in seconds
I want that ting to do all water clean!
The all respect for Marino!
They should put that powder into Tide Pods
Pls show this to Narendra Modi
God bless please come to India help us
That's a lake i thought it was a part of the field
Why dont we just dump all of that solution in the ocean
That swimming guy looks like he is trying to survive from titanic
*you can eat it because its 100% organic* *eats unknown mushroom*
we need to love earth
That lake was so green for a second I thought it was plain land- 😂
"The people came back" The contamination too, probably
This is true
Ya! his name is "marine-O"
Hey,Nas daily!!tey to visit Malaysia!!i bet its wonderful right there!!
Oh my gosh from where can I buy it
Hey could you please tell me where could buy 300 and how much it cost. thank for telling everybody.
❤️
His videos give me such a positive energy ❤️❤️
Where to buy this organic stuff?
I need that cleaning solution to detox my body.
Amazing how did he make it?
Wow you always post great videos, this one touched me the most. I didn't realize how much I love lakes and rivers and the sea. Maybe that's my passion🤔
We need more people like merino  Be the person
Ok dude how do you make a pond so dirty it looks like it apart of the land from a far
One cup can clean a whole lake with his solution woooooow
And with that solution u can clean a lake in hours or days

Marinette and Nino's son

Badly needed in india
We need to know what that is??????
need to watch full story of it
You can eat it!  Guy doesn't swallow...
Aw man i was expecting Marimo
I love how most Americans will make fun of "third world countries" but they're the ones that think of the most amazing ideas to help the world. Funny how that works out when social media and societal standards aren't in play as much
Why wasn't this on the news?! Proof that people nowadays only care about other meaningless stuff
SAN MARINO CORNED TUNA😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everybody says we need more people like that person but nobody says we need to be like that person
This substance looks like powderised alum, Indian villagers, especially Rajasthani people use it from a long time to clean water, it is eatable, and have health benefits also if taken in guidence of a doctor
I live in Perú
Love to sie it
This guy a god
U are God sent.....
we need more people to be like Marino and when the people came back. It will only repeat the cycle.
What do you mean a little bit you mean ALOT I went to the river and there was broken glass :-(
Himself into a pickle
*We dont need more people like him we need to be like him* - A wise man in the internet
Can u do one Fróm Bolivia? :3
Ahhh😌 i need this guy for my village
This guy gonna be rich someday
If the people came back too than the contamination did not disappear
Y'all where do i get that
The lake fishes:why is it spicy
$100000000000000000000😁
Where can I find his solution
Where's the go fund me to pump money into this
his videos are always edited the same way, like there is slow motion
This is elite and wholesome I wish I could meet the scientist and the youtuber
I wanted to buy it ...
Where do i find this "sollution"
Me  after watching this video with my mom Me: wow he's so good  My asian mom : just learn something from him (the one who also says) what the hell are you doing after  watching video if you can't use the knowledge well Me: * there's no pond or lake  Near only ocean here * mom you said use the knowledge well  should i go clean the ocean ??😅🤔 (My moms ultimate weapon chapall out from foot) Mom : are you tryin' to bicker with me 😡 Me: no my goddess🤐🙏
The lake switching to being cleaner is a different lake the question is why would he lie about that?????
This is absolutely amazing! Hopefully his cleaner becomes mainstream, for things like pools too instead of those harsh chemicals they currently use. 🙈
Now lets were our masks and clean dirty lakes! Even if its night or day i dont care! I broke my leg but i am still trying to be strong to make the world look like a natural   world....:)
I thought it was grass-
Not all hero’s wear capes
Now he funding to go to other countries and do this....he should be a millionaire.
Where will it get to buy
Thank you Marinooo
At first i thought that he turned land into water
Him : we need more people like Marino Me : laying in bed all day watching yt shorts
So so cool 😊 and good
Can we get this stuff in the river murray? Thatd be great, but then again. Got so much grass carp.
Marino sadly went missing after this blew up.
The people came back? Welp, pack it up. Its over.
Wow eat it n u will attract nega particles
I’ve already heard about this guy a few years back, this isn’t new.
Hats off to Marino
The water was so dirty that its looked liked a forest

We need this for lebanon beaches please help us !😔
Please send one pack of Marino here....we need him
What a Japanese do in peru? And where i can get this? i need it for my pond.
👍
I hope they use this for the Illinois River
But the eard needs dirty lakes more than vlean lakes
I was watching this with my mom bc we love his channel and when he said “Peru” she went crazy, bc that’s were we are from 🤣
Who else thought 💭 at the start he was just gonna take all the water and replace it
Marino, that’s his name, what are the chances…
Bad people: what?! We already have a lot of a clean lakes!!!  Good people replying to bad people: no, there are alot of dirty lakes   Me: wat
Other people already made that though and the dirty shit falls to the bottom
*Birds came back*  Awww thats nicee    *Humans came back*       Aight imma head out
We don't only need more ppl like this guy we also need to get him the funding to make this stuff big and clean out some more lakes
Oh, you can eat it
Can you please please send this to him!! So in our place in canada we have very very dirty water, So i want our water to be safe,clear,non-toxic so the land could be much more clean! And the river in Edmonton needs to be saved so if you are reading this thank you so so much Love your vids!! 😊
Marino is like that Minecraft player who does megabases and Gigantic redstone farms
Really appreciated
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE THIS
Marino is such a hero im so proud he's from my country, this story is not very famous nationally but had recived many international attention. He also created easy breathing anti foggy masks for people who had difficulty breathing with masks and peoppe who have glasses. Peruvian gov should found him soo much more
my lake is dirty
Earth continues to survive and thrive because of people like him. Hats off to him.
He is like an angel sent from above!!!🤗🤗🤗👼👼👼
That's incredible I can't believe that exists

Oh my WOW! OK why is this man not making piles of money from all over the world! There r polluted and horrible water ways all over the world. Really hope we can catch up and clean up our planet before it too late!
Nombre bastante apropiado para alguien relacionado con el agua
This man is literally the next Einstein. He needs more recognition if he can conduct such intense projects like this successfully.

Bruh he must get paid like a 6011 bucks
Why isn't this all over the news?
He's a God 👏🏻 Doing God's work ❤️
Me watching this him showing me that he can eat it and if we put it in water all the that will float to the top then she eating at me looking at him like what I think you're gonna throw up
And people came back too Well that's selfish...they can dirty the lake and never come back...but once it's back to natural they come again...
Nah we need more people to stop trashing 🌎 so there won't be a need to clean entire bodies of water
He is sooo kind boy He made a dirty pool to a clean pool☺️😯
The governments can do it but they dont
Marino: makes a solution that cleans water  Me: damn it looks tasty tho  Nasdaily: its edible  Me: HELL YEAHHHHH
Correction We Don't Need More People Like Marino But Instead We Need  More Responsibel & Sensible Government's All Over The World Guys ...... So That Only One Person Has Not To Worry Alone ... ..
Whats that solution ...
For some reason I really want to be friends with Marino
OH MY GOD
Is he selling that soultion ?
We don't need more people like him we need to be like him
Depends on the cost of it....
6 month later The lake has become dirty again
Tiête river in sao paulo: YEAAA BABYYYY, THATS WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR!
I learn more stuff in one minute on YouTube video than school
I think I heard of this guy before
I didn’t even notice the water
Beautiful! Where can I buy some?
ppl:YESIRR YESIRR Me:How like HoW
What was the secret solution tho 🤔
Marino corn beef

We need person's like Marino to keep this world clean, and also everyone should take responsibility of not spreading waste everywhere.
My mom is the type to make me eat that for breakfast but i dont care i still love her
This guy is a LEGEND
Woww.... Nas I want to travel & meet awesome people like you.... how do I get to do this?  When people say..... (What do you want to be when you grow up?'  Me: I want to be like Nas Daily " travel & meet good like minded people around the world.  Billionaire goals..... change the world for good & better for the people, children, & animals ♡_♡ 🙏💕🙏
We need us to be like him
He's the type of guy to be able to fix a half broken house
GOD Bless Marino!
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE MARINO, MORE PEOPLE DOING THE SAME THING AND RECOMAND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WE NEED TO MAKE THIS THING BUYABLE!
I thought the world was filled with stupid people but I was wrong the are many good people in the world and I really respect them
Can i know his ig ?
How did marino not get to own the lake he cleaned it? How do the people not give him the lake?
good job man
Me scared about piranhas:
Mark Robert did this
He's not Marino He's Mario of his country  Means favourite
After  he said "and the people did too" he should have added "slowly the contamination wil be back as well"
We need people like Marino,no we should be like Marino🤞🤞
That is absolutely incredible!! The work I am sure he put into making it!!
north and south america are the true old world have to take of it
Wait wait wait  Indians : excuse me  What about the man who turn desert to an habitable and green place  From Assam .  But it's great he turn that to this  😊
Marino needs to find a way to bomb all the water in the world with his solution.
i know why you can eat the solution it looks like FOOD
Clear my skin also with water
We don't need more people like him. We should strive be like him. How do we expect others to do something if we can't ourselves ya know what I'm sayin
Old video
Wow look at his name.....and the rest is history!
came up with a "solution" literally.
The mixture is made of strychno potatorum also known as clearing nut and dried moringa seeds. That explains why it's edible. This mixture locally called murungai vidhai and thettran kottai was used to clean lakes and water bodies by South Indian kings a thousand years ago. So it's not like Marino invented it. He just discovered it.
Hope dis cms 2 india so tat the river Ganga can be clean as before🤞🤞❤️❤️
The only one to save earth is us humans
Ph needs that
We don't need more people like him          We need to be like him
Marino looks japanese lol
Oh no... Not the people again... He's going to need to restart the process of cleaning in no time...
Woooow
Ok I understand his stuff is made from nontoxic chemicals but let's be clear ORGANIC does not mean NONTOXIC you can make 100% organic substances that are entirely toxic, like I could take 30 organic apples and take out all the seeds and eat them and die the same way as if I ate the seeds of 30 gmo filled apples   Organic does not mean nontoxic
Him : we can eat it Me : i wander what it taste like 😑😑😑😑
Exactly 0.13 percent cleaner   Yes I did the research
I want to know more, Indian lakes and rivers can definitely use a good clean up.
Omg we need that in Connecticut
Where can you buy this
America taking notes: so he’s next in line right.   FBI: he’s in Peru. He’ll be fine. As long as he doesn’t bring it over here.
🙂

*epik*
my brain: so you gon spit it out or u fr gon eat it lol-
*30 years later* “So that stuff you made… yeah…. It causes incurable cancer and it’s killed everyone that swam in it. You didn’t eat any did you?”
Couldn't activated carbon do the same thing?
I’ll take your entire stock.       Ok but seriously does he sell this I want it
Cleaning a lake is the kindest thing ppl could do🦋
Is it only me that likes his accent or what- 👁👅👁
He deserves something
I heard of something like this but the dirt sinks to the bottom
It’s like a movie, he’s the superhero scientist who cleans the water, and his name means “of the sea”. Coincidence?
He is hero of the world
What is the powder name tell plz
Wowowow
We need more people like this
Now,this thing was the best way to make World peace
At first I thought that was grass and I was like “so he turned a plot of land into a lake”
Where can I buy it from? It reminds me of outs
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 yay
Is soooooooo cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE MARINO
Baka marimo became genius marino
Thank you now you got me thinking about my worst fear: the end of the world
Other people: wow thats so cool!   Me: what does his substance taste like?
We don't need people like him  We need to be people like him
This is so sweet for him to do but the government may not accept they just want money... Like seriously why?
I'm just triggered by the way the person is swimming-  Like do y'all actually swim like that-?
I love how his name matches with marine
I need to taste that
Marino did all with Marin 😂😂😂😂😘
I'll take his entire stock...for some reason
I thought it was a feild
Does it clean the bullshit out of people?
So why isn't this product being massively used?
Yep, another thing that people ignore that cold save THE WORLD
From where can we get Marino's solution 😐😐
All the dirty likes - so you mean all the lakers except the one he’s already cleaned?
I think it’s psyllium which is made from wheat
Yes!
Is it just me or do the thing look like oat meal-
How nanotechnology saved a contaminated lake in Peru. Marino Morikawa, a Japanese-Peruvian scientist, has invented a nano-bubbling system, made up of bubbles 10,000 x smaller than those in a soda beverage, which, as they float to the surface, transfix viruses and bacteria. those who are lookin for ans.
you mean a lot cleaner?
Now thats a scientist that believe god
Wait a fucking minute I can chomp on this shit?
the birds comeback 👍 the men comeback👏 the the birds gone😢 then the lakes gone again😥 then the mens gone again then marinos back🤔🤔🤔

It’s cool I guess but it’s so expensive to produce and clean the water using the solution that it can’t be used on most areas and it also takes several treatments with the solution
Marino you deserve the noble peace prize or sum like that
Ummm.... HELLO, WORLD LEADERS! THIS IS A MAJOR NEED OF THE WORLD! CAN WE GET THIS MAN SOME CONTRACTS AND PUT HIS CREATION TO WORK?THIS IS A NEED, NOT A WANT. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? I want to order some just to have it jic. Thank you sir!!!!💖
Him after sayin it's edible: 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
See Mark Rober's video on a similar topic, to know a bit more about this.
He needs to go to atitlan fr
Don’t clean all the dirty lakes, human polluted ones that were clear before are fine but others need to be dirty to support the environment and create homes for important animals in that food chain
Up up up we need this product in the whole world!!!!!!!
You're an amazing young man.
But up a charity and help him make more and ship it to all countries so they can clean up easier
I wanna buy that
while People are talking about the product  im thinking on how his name Fits him perfectly
“We need more people like muruno” we need better people
I think i heard of him a few years ago idk.
We don't need more people like him,we need to be like him
y’all I feel hungry seeing him eat the solution :,D
It look like powdered flaxseeds but not 100% sure. I mean he did eat it so it's possible.
I bet he made his glasses out of plastic spoons to
This guy is from mark robers video
Y this guy shakin tho?
He LITERALLY found a SOLUTION 😂
We need that
So the reason the lake was dirty came back?    I’m referring to the people.
Wait does he sell the solution ? That way locals can clean lakes easier
Quick someone tell Africa
Your right we do need people like him and government agents like him
don't let earth gone
Aren’t lakes like that just dirty cus algae and bacteria are just living and doing what they do? Thats just an ecosystem for the bacteria and algae, if you clean every lake that would a major difference in the worlds entire ecosystem.
I want him in india 😔
A lot of the time lakes are not dirty, they just get a brown tinted from acid that are completely natural and clean
Pasig River beke nemen
Wow
CONGRATS FOR MARINO FOR BEYING A VERY VREY GOOD PERSON!:D
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Uh, the birds came back too...And so did humans? Waters that flamingos live in are very toxic, plus they might attack you. I don't think it's safe
100% science at it's best...
My brother's and a church group are going to peru
This mans face really said :3
I Wonder what it taste lmao
Wow. I want to eat the solution 😂😂😂
That dirty lake looked like some grassy feild
Hi Nas daily can you tell me what is that solution please 🥰🥰❤❤
We badly need people like him.

We don‘t need more people like Marino, we have to be like Marino!
Tbh nas is doing his part too by telling us about ways to help
You found other people who are worth but I found you😅.  Thanks for your videos loved it keep it up bro🤩
It is created recently but thanks to our government, it will not even come in markets by 2069
The Bird come back Lake:This is fine The human come back Lake:oh shoot
We really need more people like him
Somebody call this man to the Ganga
Some people: this guy (Marino) sucks and he is awful Me: i love this guy
Oo yes
such people need noble prize actually and should be more prominent and respected than celebrities. i read somewhere that a famous person said if only people start focusing on scientists more than celebs then the world would change ❤
Amazing 👏
him:is so eco-friendly you can eat it me:excuse me WHAT?!
How long did it take
This is just wonderful. I am SO impressed. Like I watch a lot of wholesome videos, inventions, wild life whatever it is you name it ( I like me fun videos ) but this won. Love it 😍 🙌🏻 I also love how he uses his power in a useful way. Like he’s a genius, and he can help with finding solutions. My hat to you man.
This Needs Atleast 1M Likes. You Probably Don't Agree, But I Can. This Is Saving Earth
Sanaollll
Take action!!!!!!!!!
TAKE ACTION!!!!
Take action!!!
!!!!!
!!!!
!!!!
The frogs, fish and other animals that relied on the lake being murky: "sheeeeeeeeeeeit"
I ate that eco friendly organic literally yesterday on my spaghetti
Believe this guy at your own risk. He is the one who said Jeff Bezos is so rich that can give everyone on earth 1billion dollars and still left with change🤣
His name literally means "A person of the water/sea" in my language 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Here is the secret : He used dried moringa seed and cleaning nut (strychnos potatorum)  This is the mixture our ancestors used to clean any water from  human sewage to dirty river.... In indian continent..  So any one can use this idea to clean anykind of water efficiently(without toxic chemicals)

Ok I have a question can I drink the water and I wanna become a scientist 👩🏻‍🔬
HELP THE EARTH
I agree!!
Wow amazing
Thank u for the idea
Marino from PERU? For real?! I thought He's more like from Japan... wtf *mindblown
That’s so awesome that guys did that! 🌎🌍🌏
something being 100% organic does not mean anything, arsenic seems pretty organic to me
Can you do one on a stupid app call find my phone where you have to go on your phone to use it
He needs to come to west coast USA with truckloads of that stuff.
I know why he’s so smart… his face looks like Elon musk
Only nature can solve nature's problems.    Government: and my wallet took that personally
Mario
This guy is a genius genius
Ito dapat ginagamit para sa Manila Bay..
Respectel
BUT WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE
To work for south Africa's water system
I AGREE THEY SHOULD SELL THESE
Something about that dude's swimming just seems off
What is the name of the solution please
Im gonna clean the lake that a girl made after seeing all my old metal beyblades
Just use his solution to clean up more lakes
Please Marino go to Indonesia
He is Japanese Peruvian
We need more of this stuff
You wanna know what else is 100% organic but not good for you? Weed
This guy: Great at eco cleaning the enviroment. Not famous.  Greta: Complains. Does nothing. Famous.
When i here his name  i accidentally imagined san marino 🌽 🐟
You see over there is Marine's dad and his such a superhero.
We dont need more people like him we need to be like him
He’s got an Instagram account called marino.morikawa  He made a bubbling nano system which consists of adding a microbubble solution to contaminated waters and using biofilters. “The micro-nano bubble has an electromagnetic field of positive and negative ions that works like a magnet. On the way to the surface of the water it attracts viruses and bacteria, kind of like catching them in a spider’s web,” explains Marino.   (I copied it out word for word from brightside here’s the link —> https://brightside.me/wonder-people/a-man-from-peru-has-found-an-ingenious-way-to-clean-lakes-and-its-a-breakthrough-the-earth-was-crying-for-719560/amp/ )
we need this guy there in São Paulo, Brazil to clean the Tietê river 😂😂
MaashaaAllahh... Mat Allah bless morino. If were a statesman.. i would employ him to clean our rivers
What is it?
thats just oatmeal bruv
Looks like 2 completely different locations the backgrounds are not even close
Can i get this
Nas it is amazing how often you feature one person who is making a world of difference. Thank you and thank for giving us examples worthy to be followed. These are the people who should have millions of followers.
I wish that our leaders would be like him
I think gov. Needs to tart watching YouTube especially the  'that's 1 min' series
He can eat it because it's edible, not because it's organic. My t-shirt is organic, but I can't eat it, can I..
the lake at first looked like land for me
*I'm gonna eat it cause I don't wanna be a skinny girl.*
The product he made is so expensive . We should look for easy one .
In India its called churma
Where can I buy that solution?
Can i participate with you?
That’s cool and all but I have 3 questions.  How long did this take?  How much solution was needed?  Did he receive any gift or prize?
Fucking.legend.
This man's either going to be really rich or like always we can get anything nice, end up sucided
Do you do that stuff
Me who watches Mark Rober: I am 4 parallel dimensions ahead of you
This man actually deserves his own company, just think of all the water the company could clean around the world
My favorite snack… organic lake cleaner.
What he used for cleaning water
Paddington be so happy
Wait that was a lake before
Hope they don't  kill him. For helping the Planet
him : "We need more people like Marino"  me : we can Clone Him
Great vid but where the hell can I get this???????
He should be  rich!!!!
Hello Merino come clean the baltic sea. It's the most polluted sea in the world.
The fact that Marino means marine in Spanish 0_o
He is really a wonderful man. Our earth needs humans like him.  We also have to do everything which we can do at our level to save our Earth. As by adding a drop of water we can't fill a bottle but if we will pour many drops of water then only we can fill a bottle . I think you got my point .
You now a really wish our planet was eco friendl  like no dirty lakes and risaicaling and not killing the invaorment to making our world a better plase you folks get me right
Zoro: Marimo!!??
If this was acknowledged by the government then the world's and our fate would turn for the better
He should ban the people
I love your videos ❤️
Please come to india.... 🥺🥺🥺🥺
This is where Nas is wrong   ' We have to be like him '
Legends 👏
What does his Solution taste like?
I want to buy his solution,for cleaning my brother dirty brain,yea.
Well philippines need this cauze the goverment spend alot of money to clear manila bay but  still theirs nothings improvement and its getting worst lol
I thought marino was japanese
I luv your vids!!
WOWSERS
What’s the product name-
I like your videos so much
I cant be the only one who noticed his name is very similar to marine like marine life
Marino is really good and hardworking we all should be proud of him
Hands off marino
Notice how his name is MARINO
"The people did too..." Noooooo!! Marino has just put a heck load of brain, heart and labor into cleaning that!! 🥲🥲 Much respect to him!!
Wait squid ink is 100 percent organic so can I eat it 🤡
Not all heroes wear capes, some wear bucket hats
He is using star dust
This is organic. This is my tail, real tail
How to buy this...
Me think the lake was some land
Didn't mark rober do that
Now do it to the pacific ocean…
Omg this is so sweet and I’ve been scrolling through his channel and I am so happy that the world is getting cleaner it went from a whole lot of trash ty o a lot better😻😻
Great job👏
I think we indians should learn from him😔
Hey im from peru
But I saw the same guy as a Japanese in his video
When he said  "The birds came back and so did the people" we all know what's gonna happen
You let humans into the water? Idiot! They caused it in the first place. It would have been better to use a slow acting acid when they started swimming in it.
Why these innovations fade way or lost over time he will not become Bezos or jack ma
Nas:"You can even EAT it!" Me:"...How much for 90 cups of these?"
Where can I buy that solution?
Flamingo:bird:(
Please tell me about your solution so i can make it and clean my area's parts too Blessings from Pakistan
Can you tell from which substance its prepared
I would but I need the name of the product
How was that guy even swimming
His name was kept correct
So water pollution is solved?
Still better than those SJW organizations (PETA, greenpeace, you name it) whining towards government but to no avail. *Big ol' respect from Malaysia.* 🇲🇾
Before him saying you can eat it mmmm it looks delicious after him saying wish what?
I love that his name is Marino... Like marine 😂 What a legend with his idea 👌
Marino deserves the world
At first the lake looked like grass
That made me belive in humanity
Give this man a lot of money or at least a reward
Wowwww
I hope it won't taste like crap
Willing to bet it contains mushroom mycelium.
Protect that man
This man owes my respect
Great job .. send ur solution to our country
Protect this man with all costs
If this is true why is it not national news. I pray it's true.
Marino is spanish for marine what are the odds?
Nas: "We need more people like marino" Goverment: "No we need *money* "
Where can I get some, geeezee I need some
"The animals came back and the people did too"  Me: yep to contaminate the water again
genius
And he still does not have a Nobel prize .. wow 😅😅
He's one from the millions who are still in deep sleep,   well done bro  I wished to those 999,000 who still in dreams of being able to make it......
Fantastic...
Siri I wish I could swim gear
Who else sees the before pic as land?
Where did all the contamination go after it floated to the top??? 🤔
Thats so amazing
It was so dirty I thought that it was land
Man my country really need one of these for the river.
Pov darmans brothers trying to steal the fame
Why you always wore that T-shirt only  What's the meaning of it.. 🤔 May I know
Other people : wow this guy is making the world a better place  Me : wondering what it tastes like
Where can i buy that powder
FLAMINGOS
Nobody: Me: It looks like bread crumbs
I wonder,is his stomach now as clear as the lake too?
How is no one talking about the fact his name is MARINE-O? Mind blown 🤯
We truly need more people like him:)
With a name like MARINEo I expect nothing less
That's awesome i want that solution
The fuck is that swimming form
No I agree, but wealthy people simply kill the maritos of the world.
The vid: talking about cleaning lake  Me: what does the solution taste like🤔
Can you please give me his email id.. I too have a lake here which is too dirty I want to clean it too.. so please
Other places do this type of cool stuff but here in America we dont give a crap smh and dissapointing
Marino is a legend. I hope he doesn’t get fucked over by the greedy and corrupt.
Mariano ironic name for what he does
Also this is not a solution a solution is liquid
There is one that puts them to the bottom and dissinfects the water making it drinkable
Oh that's cool im from Peru
This is like an organic version of the stuff made by p&g
My grandma is so proud of her country and I don't blame her
Or just a factory to make what he made for all over the world
Bruh, give this guy a billion-dollar budget and he'd be able to colonize Mars
So appreciate that guy
Marino, Marine, Water  Coincidence, I THINK NOT
But what is the solution actually made of?
We need to be more like this this going teach all of us a lesson and if u don’t know we’ll learn the video
We can do this to the oceon!
i like when Marino  say 'hi my name is Marino'
This scientist should sell it dude it will be super easy to clean ur pool
Hes genius cause he cares about the planet and not the earth suffer
God is everywhere ❤️
Hey why he don't use his organic solution to clean the ocean😁
I am Inviting everyone to heart soothing Quran recitation. Thank you 🙏 🙏
5 months later dumb humans populated the lake again. Dumb dumbs
Clean the Ganges please
Them: showing that the dirt goes to the top  Me: err how am i supposed to drink that
I love cleaning lakes to
Him : *eating the secret solution* Also him the next day : *vomits blood* oops I ate the wrong solution 💀
Be like Marino
Can we eat anything that is 100% organic ☹
😘
If this is a true its really do not bother me if the guy becomes multibilionare
Wow this Marino’s a genius, but where did you find him? What’s his last name? I’m very curious and would love to find out more
All I can say is what the hell and how this man is a god genius
people in 3021: it is time to clean the ocean from salt water to drinkable water
Why are we not funding this for every waterway
I like how you say something is cool, and that's something I like more, you say, that's one minute see you tomorrow :)
Everyone: let clean the dirty lake   Joe Biden: that's a great idea I'll give you my money
This dude is a hero
i watched a video like this, it was a genius idea! let’s do this and clean the world.
At first it’s so dirty that it doesn’t even look like a lake!
Him: you can eat it because it's organic  Me: yeah! So is coal, what's ur point.
Where do I buy the mixture tho? I would actually buy it
Oh people are back? Welp back to dirty lake in weeks
What a legend let's get him famous
So what's the secret formula?
Legend

Amazing bro amazing
Another stolen American's  technology
Come to Indonesia marino, i here very much dirty lake 😂

KURKEYS PLZ SEE THESE HELP YOUR WATER WITH THIS
You can use this in turkey to clean.right)?
Well nanotechnology is very expensive and our politicians are far too expensive
I made almost the same Research Study in 11th grade and I failed its so Good to see a proffesional making a product that can clean the rivers.😊
Always Clean Nature and And Protecting People Lives
Him: I've a solution that can clean the lakes of the entire planet Government: We don't do that here
Dirty water=🌎x-x Clean water=🌏:D
Very nice
I didn't know that in Peru or in Latin America there are asian people living there like Marino
Birds came back: YES YES YES YES People came back: NO NO NO NO
God bless him we don't want politicians we want this man who's really making a change.
People like Marino are contributing to the earth and we are harming for our satisfaction.
Lake? Where
What do you do with the debris wants it floats to the surface? How do you get it out of the water? Especially an entire Lake?
Hes a G!!!!!
Just cuz it's organic don't mean u should eat it.
Don't pee in it tho,especially the people
If all people like marino not just a little bit its clean for sure
Ah i See it in 2025 , people dusting lakes with this in crop dusters.
0:47 looks like Elon Musk
Make him come to qatar
Hey nas daily, is there any way to contact him..?? Email address or something..??
Wow
Why does 100% organic automatically make things not poisonous
It looks like almond powder or something
Idk if its just me or i kind of thought, at first the dirty lake was a land
Wow
Him: the birds came back Me: Aww thats soo cool Him: so did people Me: that's not gonna end well
Marino
His name literally translates to marine
Yes marino is helping the enviroment
Wonder if this works on pools instead of using chlorine
We people like him that doesn’t care about money and power, people who actually spread the truth and help the world without hesitation
Can you come to serbia
his name is very convenient.
He is a legend and i also want to taste the solution
I'm curious where does the trash go?
when Marino said "100% organic" it sounded like auto tune
Oh so it was his lake  I wish I had a lake
We’re can I find Marino and clean my country’s river and can I buy this unique item
Plot twist: he died because it was 0% organic
Everyone : wow , he's helping in cleaning the lakes, good Me : what's that organic material he used 🤔?
"Birds came back and so did the people"     People: *time to contaminate lake again!*
What kind of powder is that
👍👍
#Salutetomarino
Wow! Awesome Marino, thank you.
Why is this think not in mass production we really need this
That is what I want to be seen in YouTube rather than some cringe tik tok shit 👍👍
Wow!
MARINO! I LOVE YOU
It’s natural algae I mean no one cares
🤘🤘🤘👍👍👍👌👌👌😇😇😇
I almost thought he said HI my name is mario
Yeah 👌
Welp... we all know whos gonna mysteriously die of a heart attack in a years time.
I love Peru.. I went there on a medical mission trip and I never wanted to leave. The people were amazing and so grateful. I've been to other countries doing the same work. Most were grateful but not like in Peru. The most unappreciative people I worked with were the Dominicans. However the closer we got to the Haitian Dominican border it got better.
"Because it's 100% organic" *spits*
I want the whole world to buy this I want to try it and see if he can actually make a cereal that's eco-friendly and that sort of tastes like that actually
What makes it better is his name coz marine as in sea life so makes it better
my dad works at p&g and this is basically p&g water but it floats instead of sinking to the bottom
I thought the lake was land when it was dirty
We can use this invention in the Philippines the Pasig River is very dirty and Mysterious because every august one individual died in that river no one knows why because the water is so dirty
Can you please tell me what is that through which he clean the whole lake?🙏🏻
We now know what to put in the ganges
"You put *his solution* in the water and bam"   " *His solution* is also organic and you can eat it!"  This "solution" sounds awfully sus
I wonder how that thing tastes
That mans swimm8ng was not swiming tf is that
So how to make that powder? Using nestum?
FUN FACT : Every 60 seconds a minute passes
RIGHT ON MARINO!!!!
When he says we need more people like him why don't you start being people like him
Marino plz can I buy some  boxes of your solutions
This guy is a legend
They should put it in the ocean, then put up those things that they use for oil leaks and they can clean the ocean! This Guy is a genius

In India also there
We also need his solution in a very big amount 😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍
I remember him i saw him on YouTube long time ago cleaning the lake
Where can I buy this stuff?
I thought that there was no lake at first😂
Me who knew about this dude from that dude that let's insects sting him
Why did I think that the lake was grass and land at first😫✋
Why did I think that the lake was grass and land at first😫✋

And next the good guy Marino starts selling that "product" in over-priced cans...
Give this Men Nobel Prize
How much does that stuff cost
Ahhh yes, the Marine-friendly Marino.
Me: *wondering* Could this be used on the Red Sea?
He is in Peru not America so of course he can do this, we just suck🤣
i remember seeing his video about this and it really didn't givd me any hope cause i was thinking about cost, commercialization and stuff but this guy's shorts are the most inspiring thing ever
We want him in BANGLADESH ❤️❤️❤️

if every dirty lake becomes clean that would be not "the world a little bit cleaner"
You find something every day
Go Marino!!!
Hi I am 100 years from the future. And I know that lake. It has become the same as it was before Marino cleaned it.🙂
Don't you have any other T shirt
Want him badly
I'm sure that eating something that separates contaminated particles in water is TOTALLY safe.
The government is gonna be after him soon. Protect this man
why isn't he world famous? and his idea not yet bought by government or something?
We all hate your face
Don't clean your lake with a hungry friend folks
Wa
He's amazing! But he should share this (the ingredients) so the other countries can do it too....
He deserves all the Trillions of praises.. A God Gifted Genius!!
I think I’ve heard about Marino before
The before lake looks like land
Cool
GREAT job you are doing with these videos!
Hey serch Balbir Singh the river cleaner. Hope you make video on them
I love him ❤️❤️❤️❤️
He probably won't be alive for much longer
Hey let's contaminate our natural resources. Awe, don't worry, we've people like Marino to clean after us.
How do you be finding people like this
I never thought the phrase  "And the people did too!" Would annoy me so much lmao
Dirty lakes are but a symptom. Tons of pollution, chemical waste and toxic contaminants being dumped in the lakes is the problem.
Bro I think we just found how to clean  lakes and keep our body healthy
I wonder what the solution taste like
Can Marino come to southeast Texas and help out Galveston cause I’d like to not smell like ass when dip my toe in the Gulf of Mexico
noo WE need to be like Marino
Yeah that is so sweet
I just realized that the pictures in the beginning was 2 completely different places. 1. Where was a mountain in the second picture but not in the First picture. 2. There was no houses in the first one but in the second picture. So i dont know if its real or fake, i think its 97.3% fake
Why can't I find his products?
Fund this man.
👍👍👍✊✊✊🌹🌹🌹💎💎💎
That's 2 different lakes u can see by the mountains and and towns in the back growned

When he said :it's 100% organic I was like : I... not gonna eat it🙂🔫🙃🔫

how about cleaning the entire ocean anyway
His thing should be available in the market!!
That's a fact🤩🤩🤩
That's a fact🤩🤩🤩
Soo, you should hire me so I can help clean dirty lake. It better than don't have a job and home 😬. It been a few month I search for a job
.... I have questions 🤔 I mean where on earth do they get rid of the "dirt" after taking it out of the water and y do they feel the need to constantly clean instead of banning peeps that dirty it in the first place? ... Also does that stuff have no negativ effects on the microflora and plancton? There's too much unknown parts to this
He said we can eat it but...how does it taste
I like when he say  Thats 1 mint see you tomorrow
When the humans come, the dirt comes. 😂
This is actually a really cool invention
This is exactly the platform but I've been looking for if you can get a conversation and a meeting with owner founder of Tesla, I will be sharing three of my ideas that can help the Earth tomorrow morning.813-245-3071
Where can I find this solution
hear me out….        great valued markiplier 😳
come to india
We need you  to reveal the persons
Yes we do need more of him!!!! I think we should clone him 😏
Marino did his part to save the environment. The govt: CLIMATE LOCKDOWNS
We can do it if we actually put out time and mind into it, it's just humans are just caught up in nonsense, like making alot of money to realise what really needs to be done
How can I get hold of this guy?
Whats the ingredeant so we can clean every lake
We need millions of scientists like marino🤣👍
This is a genius idea. I wonder why people don't use this for pollution. (Understandable for plastic pollution. )
Can I buy he product
If world going to end and alien came just to save this guy
Ok Marino…I know you are a Japanese magician!
How can I buy this for 🇮🇳🇵🇰🇵🇰🇮🇳🇵🇰🇵🇰🇮🇳🇮🇳✌🏻👌👍
He is a genius but the question is how did he make that solution he made something to put in dirty water to turn into clean water but how did he do that like how did he make that
That's amazing
Marino wtf yo siendo de Perú no te he escuchado nunca
this is fake
damn faith in humanity came back too
Now this is dope
Whats that thing he puts into the water
this reminds me of that one episode of avatar the last air bender...
Katara could never
What is the taste of this thing?
he looks like elon musk ngl
"We need more people like Marino" See the problem is coming with a great invention that can help on that level is really hard to figure out
World need this solution!!
Hey I know this before
Wow 😀👍👍
Two weeks later the governments going to pollute the ocean again and we’re back to where we started
This man could literally change the world
Instead of funding billion's of dollar's into space mission's, Government's should try to make earth clean and liveable for the future.
Marino turned green Lake into marine
Yamuna calling Marino...pick up buddy
Found this in class
The question is: Does it tastes good😉
Good for him.
WE need more pepole like nas daily E
Hey Marina mind helping because i need some-
Support people like this 🇮🇳💪💪🇮🇳
Mother nature:This is my dream!
If everybody is like marino,think🤔how nice the world is.., additional our individuals who live w/ importances and not spending our life time w/ no sense, life's really too short to not knowing, noticing, magnifying, realizing etc., We must know what's our life resposiblities before we will be fooled in regrets that no any chances to rise again.
What the solution ingredients?
Let's see how long it takes for everyone to ruin it this time. People who pollute or litter should be shot and be fed to their families. Their next of kin should be sterilised and sent off to war.
Marino is really a great man.
We need more people like Marino  Me : Okay but we also need the solution which Marino made
Woooow
Cool
Hey we Indian also need help plzzzzzz me
Mark rober already did this
Now thts a miracle👌
😃😃
👌👌
What a man is dream to give what is his to all to relive again 💁‍♂
Better than the little girl talking shit in UN.
Omg butifull
Eats solution* His saliva:
This man has found the way to help Africa
Marino, fitting
"So what did he used?
What did he use
Thats amazing
We need his help
Thank you for the information now, how do i make Marinos solution recipe?
Omg that is a stunning invention,  please help as many as you can, clean water is scarce as hens teeth nowadays. REALLY Kudos to you Marino.
Sad thing is in a month or 2 he will probably be dead and his invention will disappear
Dis guy a savage cuz he don’t listen to the church or the government
Me:is that oatmeal-?
With a name like that, he was born for this
Marino has my respect
Can’t wait to eat up all those bacteria from the top of the water
Excuse me but the guy swimming looked like he was literally drowning😭
Someone should get a war plane and load it up with this and spray it all over the ocean
I saw someone who did the same but instead I think it went to the bottom?
Marino is mega chad
Save the earth
Absolute gigachad.
How did he did that
Marino looks japanese but hes peru! THATS MINDBLOWIN
Wow
We also want video on Pakistan yoo!
All fun and games until he “mysteriously” disappears
What it is tho
River Ganges(Ganga) needs this
Marino: *I become more powerful than any other Jedi can imagine.*  Goverments: *He's to dangerous to be left alive!*
Predators who has camo's for the environment after the cleaning: D:
“It’s organic” me who knows that the poison dart frog and monkshood/wolfs-bane are organic
Him eating it made me super uncomfortable.
Why don’t he share this solution to the whole world and clean every water reservoir??
What type of material he used?
Noice
Wow so many r good 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
😊
Marino it's so kind
Where can i buy it?
Hope my state does this.
But the thing is does the people know him that he cleaned the lake because other people will think that the government cleaned it
The original lake looked like the land around it. He did a great job!
🤣THE WAY HE SWAM
Government : no, we need to buy weapon.
It's eatable because it's organic...yeah poison just doesn't exist I guess
After cleaning wrong animal got attracted , that animal will turn lake back into previous state 😂.
Yo he needs to find a girl like him so they can get maried and have kids like them.
So whats the recipe? How do we get the magic water? You told us the story GREAT now how do we buy it?
❤  Don't tell us how to get it or how much he used or what it is called. Just eat it.👍👍
Lame
Yes Mark Rober has done the same thing about a year ago
Nobody cares lol
💯💯💯💯 really u doing great job pls don't stop the channel gon on🔥

“Little bit”.
This video has been reposted at least 7 times

He’s a true man in society
A great scientist..creating solutions.. Not creating problems to sell solutions.
This is amazing 👍 ..We need this ....
dude somebody pay this guy a fortune and donate this for free to big time eco friendly companies so they can use a helicopter or something and dump this on the lakes
God is Amazing!!!Read your Bible!!!(Not forcing)✝️🙏🏿❤️
We don't need more people like him.  We need more brain cells like him.  Personally, i got 12 brain cells.
Wow!
Wow?
And of course his name is marino
Can I have the recipe

Can i get some to clan a river
That mean you are cleaning a human junk
HES god man
This guy can change the world in 1 minute hopefully he can find a guy who made a car that’s all trash that would be cool 😂
Birds come back Me: :))  People come back Me: >:\\
Instead of saying we need more people like Marino  Lets Just Be Like Him :))
I like how his name is Marino, and in Spanish "marino" or also "marina" means "from the sea". Well, he cleaned a lake, not a sea, so that is fun for me.
Mans real life suicune… wow
Indonesia need this
He's a genius and acually cares about the world unlike other cruel people
I love when people make things to help our earth🤩😊
That's so Amazing
No no we don't need people like him WE NEED PEOPLE ACT LIKE HIM !!!
I thought it was just land at first
Please clean our lakes and Rivers 🙏
We need the solution recipe all around the world so we can clean lakes because the lakes in England haven’t been cleaned in parks for like nearly 100 years.
Plz visit India Mr Marino
Yes we need more humans like Marino!!! and less humans who kill and hurt animals and ruin the beautiful plant earth 🌎 🌎🌏❤❤❤
He is a threat to big greedy companies
*So...that mean when i eat That all Dirty things inside my Belly will Go ups?*
Amazing I love the way he also makes it inspiring
Shut up ya jew
"we need people like Marino"   Yes we areee
Marino pls come to indonesia

He’ll Be Dead By Next Week…
Wow tys was me dream

Marino is a real g
Salute to this person ❤️
Yes yes this is what people were looking for. Some way to clean large amounts of water
No like we REALLY DO need more people like him. Without our water we dead fam dead as hell.
We Should Be like Marino
Yo! Mario dude you will be the best water scientist 👨‍🔬 😉
I know it suppose to be wholesome but it just make me think how we can do it everywhere
What's the point of drinking water when it comes to the top it will go in the straw and just make it dirty again
I thought that was land..
Why the people's came back? To trash the lake again?
Some villages home come back also in the back
I Think it make sense too for people doest need clorine n whatever other chemical for their Private Pool @ Swimming Pool
Hats off Marino👍🏻👏
At the beginning I didnt even know that. Was a lake I thought it was land 😂
The bracelet he is wearing I have that one 'marino'
I hope the government doesn't do anything to this good man
Kailangan yan ng manila bay
Where do I go to find out more about this dude's product?
Gracias Hombre de Peru Te amamos al igual que tu país 🔥❤️
Bro, I thought the dirty lake was just an open field.
Wait is this really one minute lets see!  1:00
The person swimming tho
"Because it's 100% organic!" I know he probably means it's edible stuff, but usually stating that doesn't mean it's edible. Wood is also 100% organic, doubt you'd eat it
Dammm amazingly beutiful
He solved hunger and not having a burtty lake wow
Caraca, Marino!! Limpa o Tietê aqui pra nós em SP, nunca te pedi nada bro
Um can a animal eat that
My name is Marino like his
There's no way he spent so much time on this😱
I can taste the solution form miles away
We need marino in the philippenes too like in our river here its super dirty and our adress is 94 river side potrero malabon city.
We need more of his product too
When the ‘solution’ is a ‘solute’ that makes a ‘suspension’
Tell maino to give the foventment this asap
Wow wow woooooooioooooooow
So why hasn't this been used or advertised because I never heard of this until now??
I have  A freind from peru
I’m Peruvian so this is cool for me
Half japanese?
I want to know how to make that solution. He should make a video tutorial for making this solution.. So that our environment can be cleaned.
Nice man👍😀
OUR HERO
Try cleaning the rivers/harbors of cities, so that way everyone can see all the people that got the new concrete yeezys
Marino cleaned the Marine and gave life to Marine fish
*Marino? More like Mirio- **Mha music starts to play**
How ironic his name : "Marino" ...
Markiplier?
Were is his man luigo
Yeah Nas... forget about the lake, first clean ur own heart...
Wow
What a legend
Recpect to marino

I wish the ppl here too will clean ):D
Marino is a G! Damn that guy is amazing

People like this need to me making bank, not girls on tiktok shaking their ass
“Man, I hope those bodies I threw in a century ago don’t float up too”
How to save this video
I was like what the hell where is the lake oh theres the lake
Malaysians I see you se're gonna go buy this hehe
Humanity is really  beautiful.
CAP something doesn’t add up flamingos live in toxic waters so it can’t be clean😶

Marino...His Name itself mean Marine... Destiny...
That's 1 minute See you, tomorrow
Please look into "lago san roque" in Villa Carlos paz, Cordoba, Argentina. It would br amazing for your product poored there
cool
That looks bussin
I love these kind of ppl
Me is that oatmeal yummy
Where did all the junk go wasent it supposed to float up?
But kids in 2021:   Smart “nerd” who can come up with world saving solutions or a high school  rapper..💀
Please we could clean the oceans and find a solution to stop the trash
But the ultimate question:  *what does it tastes like*
Doesn't say what the stuff is.
pls share his solution
The real Aqua men ❤️ name make more sense
Is no one gonna talk about how his name somewhat matches to *Marine*
Bro damn clean the ocean
Ever come to india last year one man complete growing a whole forest in deforested land whole forest he gaves his lifes 30 year for environmental cause
That man is amazing.
I have never heard of Peru
They should ban humans from the lake
well people do clean water but only on pools i guess thats all i have seen
ayooo he type cute for a scientist
Him: you can even eat it Me:wah.. ITS OATMEAL!!! I WANT IT
If you would tell us what he used then we would be able to clean it
WOW I WANNA GO THERE :)
“The people came back too.” I don’t think it’s gunna b clean anymore after the kid with the crab swim trunks comes in.
You should put that stuff in my brain-
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GRASS
Not Just A Little Bit Cleaner But So Much Cleaner That's 1 Second See You Tommorow
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssss
This the same guy Mark rober covered?
So before this I saw a how Sigapore clean the rubbish in one day video So does this Marino Solution helps with the special water 😂
You're kinda late to this
I guess you can do this with pools right?
"We need more people like Marino"  My lazy self: maybe next year..
that makes no sense if it brings all of the waste to the top it should look dirtier
And later people started ruining nature
I'm peruvian but I feel like the only peruvian in the us because i never see anybody else that's peruvian (though I know there are peruvians in the US )
I feel like the YT algorithm is stalking me
This, this right here is truly something to behold  I would love to sit and talk with this guy about his invention.
Hőség vagy tesók, ő is megmondta :D
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🥳🥳🥳🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮
I Love these videos keep like that!
Dis dude is legendary in my book five stars for marino boiiiis
Even tho it's organic, i don't think you should eat it i mean, if it cleans water and you're stomach has liquids too...
Who was waiting for Marino's recpie but met with disappointment.
*and the people came back too*  Yeah to pollute it again 🙄🙄
Omg he be talented tho..
Thousands of claps for that guy
The guy looks like my dad
God bless him
Bruh I thought it was land not a lake
Don't you think that if he REALLY found such a solution there would be no more water pollution in lakes and oceans?
Does it work for crude oil?
😢 this was the most beautiful thing I've seen in a very long time. We do need more people like him.
Birds came back    Shows us flamingos
I want to eat it now
Vamo el peruano
My mind is blow😐
This guy randomly appeared recommendations and now I have to least watch one video a day
The humans came back too, huh? Well… This will probably become a loop…

Everyone: "He can clean a Lake in a friendly way!"  Government: "We do not accept it because we need money and let the earth suffer"
Wish at fililpines too.

Pls review  mountain man manji,from india,who alone cut whole mountain in 25 years and make road for village,because he lost her wife who not get medical treatment due to this mountain

Can you please show us more 🙏
Well, he is name Marino..so..
Birds come back   Lake: sector is clear  Humans come back   Lake: NOT CLEAR NOT CLEAR
No one is going to ask what the cleaning agent is? It looks like psylium husks aka Metamucil.
"The humans came back to" The lake: "I was contaminated for a reason my friend-"
Anyone wanna volunteer to start cleaning lake erie for us?
I hope he comes to Nepal Nepal has very dirty lakes and I wanted someone that was older and more technology thanks for help the country
We don't need Marino, let him make more great things. We need the powder
Great
Marino clean dal lake kasir like this
How i didnt hear abt it on the news this would be revolutionary Whats in it anyway
For a second i thought it was just flat land when it started-
he should be the environment minister 🙂
once My friend swimd in richfield flood at the end of a storm and never swim there again 🤣
Why to me he looks like markerplier
Were do i get the solution. So i can do it in my town
Wouldn’t changing the water effect the fish?
I'm so impressed
Ever since I saw your video about the woman in Pakistan, I don't like to watch anymore of your videos. I always feel like it's a clickbait situation.
Damn!! One of the greatest invention ever!
❤❤❤❤❤
Is the powder buyable
Manila bay should have this solution
Don't say we need more people like him but say we need to be like him
What is that powder called  I need it
His solution needs to come in India
Who else wishes that there were more people like this in the world
Wut bus the solution tast like
But what was it tho
How this guy cleaned his lake and how you can do to!  Answer: buy product, buy it now
India could use this
I love this guy
I regret the fact that people including me know Kylie Jenner and shits but not this guy.......I feel sorry for myself..
Wow the guy is Friendly
"The humans came back" Me:here we go again-
Need this for ganga river
Let's see, man invents a 100% organic water treatment and treated a lake for free .......he will be killed and his billion dollar idea stolen or buried
Why asian hate?   No one has made this  Now   Back to covin😭
What we need is humans to stop trashing the earth....
I wonder what it taste like 👁️👄👁️
Where can I get these?
Marino seriously?
😯😯😯🤯
Перу Peru Имеет красивое озеро Has a beautiful lake
"The people came back too" Get ready for second round of cleaning

Considering his name is Marino makes it even better
Love you marino
Can we appreciate that his name is MARINO i mean its literally said Marine-O
Can I get the scientist to my country
We really need peoples luke Marino
Fake Zionist
We need that guy
How you so do that
this is cool,but please don't believe that everything 100% organic is edible
He’s a wizard
Hope he don’t get assassinated
It would have been nice if you mentioned the name of the product and a link to it.
Gorevment should spread a lot of this in my opinion
Everyone: wow me:noice voice
Where that dirty goes again it goes to another lake
I thought the lake was land for a second
I love marinos idea
* me wanting to eat it because I am so hungry* * thinks it taste bad*
Instead of saying we need more people like marino how about be one yourself
Throw the solution in Venice
I like your videos
“the humans came back too”  lake: *ah sh*t here we go again*
The only thing that worries me about this man is how he finds these people
"because its 100% organic"  5secs later "spits it out" 😂
"a little bit cleaner" lmao
Solution was made up of what
Respect to Marino! 🙏🏾 he made that lake very satisfying
Put that in the worlds biggest lake the ocean
Wow
Wait I remember I heard your story from a book from young scientists
We indeed need this type of scientist not those who create nuclear weapons  #clean_lakes
Lemme buy it!
I love this. Can you come clean Lake Ontario? Thank you from all Canadians
Marino is almost my last name moreno lol
Damn
“You can eat it!” Me: how it taste tho?-
Hey umm so you said we need more people like morino so..... GET YOUR ASS OUT THERE!!!!
Respect to my g Marino but I didn't like the part where he said human came back too!!!!!
Better ban people from swimming
bro if u think about it just cleaning that lake is still horrible for the environment
This is awesome!
This is so cool, I want more people like this
I found a Japanese scientist in Peru 🇵🇪😅
We would like Marino here in the philippines
Wow y me sorprende pq lo hizo una persona :0
We should follow this guy's example and be more like him and spread his story.
Can you do something in the philipines pls
He should get a Nobel prize
This is the bruh moment and amazed moment for meh o.o
A laundry scientist did something similar on the mark rober channel, but instead it floats down so it’s more suitable to drink
son of a bitch, what an awesome guy
I thought the dirty lake was a land
Oof a little
Peru Hideo Kojima
I thought the lake was the ground and he dug up and made it into a lake
Dude looks more Japanese than Peruvian
“The human’s came back” OH GOD DAMMIT
☺️🤯👍🏊🏄🌊🏞️🌅🌍💖❤️💌🇵🇭
Marino deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
I KNEW IT WAS EDITION!
Lake Ponchatran, LA and Lake Apopka, FL need this!
One man did all of this. Unbelievable
Not me immediately reminded of that short film "Cream."   Totally...
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ph minus:look at what they need to mimic a fraction of our power
Cool
what it look like grass but no is dirty water
I love this man’s videos
I thought the lake was grass for a sec…
I 100% agree with this guy 🤞
San marino the country
Me After he said it is Edible: Is it that delicious enough to eat it.
marino looks like my dad
How can we get his product?
The humans came back too The LIKE wtf is going on
We can do this but our government would write it down then forget about it
He better droo the recipe
I thought he said Mario
Proud that I was born in Peru where I can i buy this solution
Can you please come to NYC
Cool👍👍
This is seriously amazing! 😭💯🔥
I like how most comments are complaining that their own species is entering a lake that was just cleaned and could easily be cleaned again
❤️
OMG this dude actually came to my school once and did a presentation in front of us
I love this guy
That looks like grass that is how dirty that lake was
Ok next we must do littering-people-repelent
Wooow that's amazing
There was something similar, but it drops all of the filth to the bottom and I'm pretty sure you can't eat that one
"The birds came back":   "The people did too!": *Intense swimming*
What do you mean by a little bit cleaner
Yes
This is absolutely incredible!!!
By  Island Park at a Bridge there is a lake and its Dirty🤢😞
Marion is a Hero to all Lakes
Documentaries be like: The lake was dirty...until it wasn’t!
Bring it to Detroit
Can the mayor of Flint Michigan watch this video
100L Marmara ya atsakya
Marino for life . Marino is the soluction for the world
We did this shitt
Bruh you can tell there not even the same lake look at the city in the background
"Dam that is clean" Haha get it?     Sorry
Beblike Marino
Mark Rober watching this like
India needs this to revive its rivers
I cant tell its a land not a dirty lake...
American lakes: “where can I find this solution? maybe on Amazon or something?”
This will ruin a lot of nature
Did he also dig up half the mountain in the background
Man this is REVOLUTIONARY. This man is a real genius
The citys behind the lakes were different
Well should've kept this secret the government gonna come for him now
Where can we get his organic cleaner?
"The people came back too" We are gonna need a lot more of that powder then
😳
Someone needs to learn that guy how to swim
When he ate it I thought he was gonna die 😭
SMART MAN we need people like smart and thinks about the climate
WOW👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Now that's we can call real super hero 🙌  👏  💪 that entire world 🌎 need him ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro he deserves so much money
They just talked to us about this one year ago... I'm from Perú, and it's kinda heartwarming knowing that my country is not completely lost, that there are still people out there caring for their country, for not only themselves (As it would help them live in a better environment) but the animals that lives in there ☺️
lol actually the first time ive ever liked a youtube short
This is tooooo amazing💯💯💯 And yes we need more people like him to invest in life and not just themselves and ones closet
Did everyone believe the pictures?? Can all you please look carefully, they r different places.
Guys I got it but we do is we create a machine that can multiply people and then create more Moreno happy and eco-friendly again
Wow he just destroyed a whole biome
Yeshhhh
Thank you so much Marino
Wait if you eat it does it mean all the chemicals in your body will come to the top and you will throw up?
The humans came back to   And that’s how the lake was dirty again
He copied Ron from gta
Indian govt should take it and clean yamuna river
I hate it when people say "you can eat it, it's 100% organic" there are many things that are organic but can still kill you if you eat them lol, like Datura or Oleander, etc
😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Clap it up 👏
And they can clean the dirty water in states that peaple drink
how?  And what is that?
I’m Peruvian and I didn’t even know this :0
Him:The birds came back Me:ok   n o i c e Him; and the people did too!  Me: My brain: oh so that means they will pee and put tras- Me: s t o p   i t   g e t   s o m e   h e l p
And dont forget we need more people like u to spread the words out
Imagine if someone pooped in there?
Marino looking like Markiplier-
My respect for this guy. Such a genius
When he showed the dirty lake I thought it was grass
This is surprisingly interesting
Hi come and help us in Nigeria's Niger delta...so much pollution ...
Marino is the key to the future
Salute to Marino😆
Grab some tons for yamuna river in india😂
Truly an inspiration
Let's not need more people like Marino  *Let's be one of them*
Marino cleans the lakes and made bird come back  Be like Marino
OMG!! Marino sell me 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Kg of the solution!!!!!!!
The people came back: well, I guess we'll need more solution in the future
That's amazing
So y doesn't he give his famous recipe
Can someone use this for ganga river in India?
Lake erie needs this
Yeeeeeeeeees lake be like what just happend
Because it's organic is not a reason ...
Please Nas daily, what chemical is that and how will anyone get one, please
What's the name of the solution?
Why you call pirou instead of peru?
Then why are we not doing this everywhere
We need it in İstanbul so badly!!
Give this solution to India please our holy rivers are dying 😞
Ohhh god that guy bless u
“Little bit cleaner”  Me: no VERY CLEAN
Mark rober already did this
Hey I like to buy some please  For people to help
Give me that solution I will clean our lake
Come back please come to gavatine
This man might clean the ganges soon
We NEED to contact MrBeast even if you hate him HE MUST SUPPORT THAT GUY AND WHAT HE DOES!
The fact he has marine practically in his name seems perfect to me
I’m sorta surprised that it worked. Most of the “contaminated particles” aren’t that bad on they’re own. It’s when there’s too many that there’s a problem. Having none of them is almost just as bad for the organisms that live in there.
Great! Now I can have a new seasoning for my chilli con carne
Fun fact: people came back and started peeing in the lake Jk🤣🤣
Products link
You can eat it! It’s 100% organic. For fucks sake, I’m losing faith in humanity just watching YouTube shorts
You all are's thinking if its good for the environment
I will! I am a girl not a boy and i am 9 years old
Big up Marino
Your stories are .... im going to be honest, THEY ARE GREAT!
Hearing u can eat the solution. Me: WHERE CAN I FIND THIS
Ty
This is so motivating
This is going to change the world
I'm sorry but I can't be the only person who thinks that you talk like Darh Man
"Contaminated Particles"...Bro, most of the discoloration is either dirt or algae...Stop overcomplicating. All power to Marino though. Props.
I thought the lake is not there its so green i can see it
We absolutely need more people like this ❤
That sooooooo helpful in philipines where i live its fulllll of trash like a lot its sooo dirty some pepole never went there i fill sooo sad;(
Mike Rober: *yes.*
Watch Mark Rober’s video on this if you’re interested :)
Where’s the scientist they makes the clone machine
Really incredible
"A little bit cleaner"
Goddamn some of yall just can't help yourselves from trying to shining star awww baby wants their bottle?? Jesus you guys are so deep😢😢😢😢😢
Where can I buy some to eat?
We just need Marino’s formula.
I'm not boutta eat it until we get an fda approved ingredients list
When he showed the before picture i didn’t even see the lake I thought it was just a landscape 😂
Y is nas repost ing his videos
Where can I get this solution
How he clean it
Before the lake got cleaned it looked like a pice of land
Oh wow more people like him please ❤️
0:50 so it's for only lakes? 😕   Pfft.. don't mind me🙃  Great job 👍 Nice!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
He hero of saving lake
You can eat that?? How?!?!?!?!
When you eat it, all your coca cola you just drinked become alot of sugar and water
Human like this are good people and they love god😊😇
How much time it will take
Him : and people too! Sharks : 🗿✨
And now the ingredients of the solution will almost be extinct XD joke
John 21:25: "Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them was written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."  Amazing huh? 😏
Government's around the world probably want his head on a platter. Anything that will save nature and humanity is attacked at all fronts. Prayers and best wishes for morino
look at Marino man so inspirational
Wow.
Thank you Marino
wheres the news that the government used this thing?
God bless this Hero!❤️❤️❤️
Let’s goooo Mario
If only the world could actually be perfect   Like healty earth wise
"The birds came back" So cute   "The people did too"  Looks like the viscous dirt cycle is starting again
I love your videos,  they are so inspiring
That is very good because i wanted my country's lake to be cleaned as well  P.S Im from the philippines
Bro philiphines should use this because here rivers and lakes are notoriuos of being dirty and black because of human stool and dirt
You probably make the best shorts on youtube
Don't say that  'WE need more people like him' say 'We need to be people like him'
That is amazing,we need this most everywhere in the world sadly at this point.
Omg I think that take a year to clean the entire... That whatever she/he call
Nice
But can you Drink the water
😭 Please come clean SA South Africa.!!
The dirty lake looks like a big grass field
I you eat it all of your shit will come out within 1 minute 🤣
Serious question. If u pit water and this in your mouth would it clean ur teeth
He is a legand
Fantastic!! So.....where did he put the sludge? 😊
He is mega legend
I really like u .... U present us the best content thanks and all the best 🤟🤟
The fact that you can eat is just: eww
Oh man, this guy just turn the toxic lake into a Family friendly Lake( not friendly fire)
Really makes you wonder why governments are not using that so easy solution.
I think we need his solution powder more than we need him.

Lake cleaners: guys we found our biggest client
We need more people like marino but we need more solution like marino use

We need to do our ganga river in India
Roronoa zoro
This can be used to clean the gangga water Does not change the ecosystem in the gangga River,It will really help India to reduce water pollution there.
Funny how something this revolutionary and he doesn't even mention what this organic magic stuff is, so that other people around the world could use it.
Amazing guy

People have jobs and not much free time
We have a scienseit (sorry if I spelled wrong) in Bucharest who want to clean the whole black sea
as a pinoy i reccomend your product to be distributed on all dirty waters specially at manila. nice invention btw.
Bro sell this you gonna be famous in history for fixing water pollution
Can we get Marion's contact information or email address to get this solution jar to pure the water?
I find ironic his name is Marino. It's as if he was made for this
That weird guy who's swimming make me non stop laughing😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I dont like the way you speak and you move your head.
What does the product clean exactly and where can I buy it?
Can you hive it to manila bay XD
I need that solution
omg what is that thing! i want to buy
Beautiful just, beautiful
U mean drink?
So the whole time that was a lake not land?
Is it real... If so then it has to be started preparing the solution and apply wherever human spread junks
I mean was it the humans fault or did he just kill an ecosystem for some swim time
Lol the way he said Peru
✨✨✨🙏🙏🙏🙆🙆🙆👌👌👌👌🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Soo the organic solution can also help stop hunger
"The humans came back too!"  Me: *Ah sh*t, here we go again!*
So if u can eat this Will ur poop become white?
The fact that his name is Marino ๏_๏
What is the solution made out of though?
I thought that It was an hill
We all need to be more like Marino.
Him: this man cleaned an entire lake! Me: 👁👄👁 what lake
Humans will just destroy it again overtime 🤷‍♂️
Salute to marino
Your storys give me faith in humanity
We he said the people came back to I'm like they was the problem
Bro we need that in india
*A little bit cleaner*  That's a little bit??
Sooooooo if you can eat it- does it clean your intestines?
When can we buy his product then can eat the product maybe it should be in super market
BLOODY LEGEND
Protect that man. We all know how much governments and the powers that be hate things that help the planet and life.
Its inspiring what is that solution..
Wow
Damn straight we need more people like him
I want to meet him and work with him
This is humanity 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️😊
Finally, an actually helpful invention
we don’t need dudes like moroni to help clean more lakes coz he already made it—
I think it was the name
This is sick!👍👏
People came back too  3 months later: hey Marino! We need your help again
Why do I cry at these things in the morning
Honestly i thought that was grass at first
Wow! I had seen him turn a Japanese lake and new this was next but I didn't know how far he had gotten! Cool update!
Its so eco friendly you can eat it! Well, you can eat anything, its the question if its good for you or not
I thought he was gping to say we need mo marinos

Wow this amazing imma subscribe
We need this man in India , ganga and mithi rivers are in danger
My local lake needs this no cap
Seeing this video gave me a little bit more hope for humanity And I was pretty damn desperate
So what is not organic is not for consumption? No more water for me I guess.. Also, PVC is organic. And I'd rather not eat that.
"I found a scientist, who TURNED THE FROGS IN HIS LAKE GAY"
So there is such thing as a sand dollar
Where can I buy this stuff❓
This is the new tide pod challenge but safe
Wait till someone capitalize this

"We need more people like Marino" We need to be like Marino!
How can this guy be contacted?  I'm planning a project and need to get some of his product.
"The people came back too" Lake: *aah shit, here we go again*
He is truly a legend doing that by himself
Use it in India's Ganges river
This guy: the birds came back  Me: its a flamingo
salute
But flamingos like dirty water.
The legend are real
Marino is a perfect name for this dude.
Well of you told us what it is maybe we can. JK, no hate this is amazing.
Time to go tell my parents their dream of me watching educational stuff by choice on YouTube has become real
I feel like even we clean all things even the forest and all oceans and lakes there still so many plastic
Ever heard about Balbir Singh Seechewal, the baba who single-handedly cleaned a 160-km long river in Punjab. Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal was honoured the 'Hero of Environment' title by TIME Magazine, becoming not only the only Indian but also the only Asian to get this distinction.
Where can I buy this
Heads off to that scientist ❤️
India need this type of people or solution
The solution solves pollution
Wow this guy is so friendly To mother earth 🌍
"His solution is so eco friendly, you can eat it, because it's 100% organic."  I mean... My shit is also 100% organic, doesn't mean anyone could or should eat it.
"The birds came back". *Yellow glasses guy*  "And so did the people". 😯...
Make citarum river back to normal
Yes we do
"people come back too" Lake: Here we go again
*Who else would have walked into that lake thinking it was pure land..*
"It's so Eco-friendly, you can eat it!" *HOL' UP-*
We need clean earth not dirty pollution😩🙄🙄🚫🌎
Awesome!
Watch his get assassinated and have his death ruled "suicide"
At this point he can become the richest guy in earth with that! why aren’t people like him mentioned more?
For a sec a tough that was a plan land but it's not
Respect
Please send Marino over to Malaysia, we really need him here.
We're eating something delicious that can clean water. Eyo my belly being cleaaaann
Nice!  So... What's the magic potion?
That’s amazing and we do need more people like him

I want to be like him
What is the barrier that hinder Marino's solution being else worldwide?
No ,what we need is mass production of this product to be available for cheaper price so that all environmental lovers can access it and get to work immediately
Wait if u eat it up acid  will float to the top 🤔
Me:can I eat some? Marino:uhm..- I made it for lakes and not to eat all the time  Me: 👁👄👁 ok *eats*
I remember him, he's a big person
Earth needs more like This Human..
I need this powder or whatever it is so I can go camping.....but I will be able to rough it.
This had been invented a long time ago
I am from Peru🙈😈🇵🇪
Mark rober did a video on a company that did this like years ago and the company made the liquid go to the bottom of the cup so you could drink the water
Whats the name of his selution?
Some one please give this guy a medal of honor or a noble peace prize 🙏 😊
I can't applaud enough for this selfless man who is obviously incredibly intelligent! Thank you for making the world see this 🤗👏🏻
Thats 1 minute see u tommorow 3months later OK soo i found this guy who
Wait that was a lake?!
Hide this man from the Clinton's.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A LITTLE BIT YA BI***
I thought he was gonna say "so we can clean not just 1 lake but the whole damn ocean" lmao
This is so amazing! I just have one question:when it rose to the top,then how did he take care of it?
What does it taste like
Chemical mix:  *brings the waste to the surface* Marino eats the mix: *Choughs up a turd 5min later*
Marino = of the Sea
Whatever you do don't keep this for yourself the entire world needs this
Damn finally I’m proud of my country.
We should freeze Marino untill we figure out how to clone people and then unfreeze him and make people like him
Funny thing is, "Marino" Is an adjective in Italian used to describe beings or Objects that are ocean related
OUTSTANDING
LEGEND
Clear lake California need to be cleaned badly
Marino Helps water  Doing what he was born to 😎   Needs to call his stuff Marine-o
He is a good man
Where is d solution
Okay but what is this thing he used ???
I hope Marino sells the solution so we can do what Marino did
more people in the world should be like this!!! besides being ecological it is edible!!!!!! will it work in seas??? this could be salvation!!! (I'm using the translator sorry if the pronunciation is forced or incorrect)
We really need people like this
It doesnt even look like a lake. It looks like land.
Whats the name of the product:D
It’s exactly 1 minute
He deserves noble prize for this...
Yes, absolutely YESSSSS!!!!
Ese es el titicaca , yo vivo cerca
Ag first I was like” That’s just land🙄” then I watched again and “ OHHH THATS WATER?!?!?”
Wow, finally a Yt short which isn‘t a weird TikTok
Imagine the tarpon imma spool
Whats the solution called so i can clean my pond
Meanwhile there is a man who actually is a plumber that never do any plumbing and instead go fight a gorilla and a tortoise to save his girls.
I love his accent
Fitting that his name translates to “man of seas”
Damn
This dirty lake? Where? All I see is a grass field.
🙏🙏
yeah
How would someone get in touch with Mariano? I have a few lakes around where I live that I would love to buy his product and clean, please let me know
HE NEEDS TO CLEAN LAKE ANNA
So he killed an entire lake?
I know it would be too much to ask the solution formula but it would be amazing if you could sell that to all the governments around the world , so all the lakes especially india(the biggest river the most auspicious river of our country yumuna and ganga  has form foams in it) we need this solution it will help
The way he said peru sounded like an Argentinian no cap
Save the ocens and seas this lake is the beginning of the future.
This is wonderful!!!!
Nas daily the bringer of good news
Me wanting to buy it so I can put it in my drink after my sister drank out of it:  👁👄👁 mOtHeR mAy I bUy tHiS?
I know a guy with a meth lab does that sound cooll
Name of tha organic material ?
Marino el mismisimo aweonao que salvara el mundo
I dont wanna use it just taste it
This is Cool
Yeah. But, nerve gas is organic... An organophosphate.
Laggy
I found a scientist in new Mexico who saved the world from aliens
The lake was so dirty and green that when I looked at it for the first time,I thought that there is only land
He should've put a no humans sign
Well the sea near Istanbul has to be cleaned plz help marino
There should be a show about this guy called Marino the marine hero
I love it
Me after hearing you can eat it ... gross!
YESSSS
Can I get some for my pool?
It'll soon be contaminated if the people be coming back too
That must have taken a lot
Pool cleaners: no stonks
Marino is about to be rich as fuck
We need more of that magic powder
Marino is a name that comes from the word mar, which refers to the ocean, or in some occasion to big bodies of water, so he has a name about water and works with water
I've once entered into an innovation compatition where we either create our own innovation or present an innovation made by others (with permission). My team present the same exact thing. A solution to clean water. I really thought it was an ingenious creation but further research, it turned out that a lot of people have created it. Just with different ingredient. Ours came from an organic source. It is a bit unstable but works very well. The creation may not be original but it is an innovative way to use an unknown plant. We got Gold btw🥇
Bruh i couldnt tell it was a lake like wh-
The governments gonna kill him
This can create so many good paying jobs. Why do they not make this the aim for cleaning pollutants in the ocean
If any of y’all know what the solution is called, hit me up in the comments 🙏
Sir give me that solution
This person is a HERO 💖
We we have the full name I want to read more about this project thanks
I wanna eat it
If all water was clear many things adapted to murky water would probably die
These one min vids are amazing, respect for this guy who puts his effort into making these
Start with the ones in central New York
Okay bro you could've told us what the solution is made of so the people who genuinely want to clean it can use it
We need more people like Marino. And also his solution recipe.
Isnt this video 1 year old or somth? Still impresive tho
This is kinda like that mark rober video
Anyway, Yall gonna ignore that man's swimming...
Respect
Wtf is pedu
You didn’t answer the question whats inside of it
Can't clean his accent tho
Omg. If you have covid.. EAT IT!! It will separate the covid and you'll poop it out :0    (I'm kidding don't take this too seriously-)
This reminds me of the formula that mark rober covered in his video but idk if it can clean an entire lake
How just how did he do it
Is it possible to clean the Pasig river in the Philippines with that solution? Istg if I become filthy rich, I'll buy tons of that thing to clean that murky ass river
I'm confused, where is the lake in the first picture lol?
Just me do you sound like dhar man
This dude is legit a fucking genius
Ok but why does he look like Markiplier
Warino
Omg so cool
Tbh i thought that was grass for a second
Soooooo anyone gonna vote him president lol like hellloooo
Me when i see the before lake for the first time: *I see grass, i touch grass.*
Your so smart 😲
What's the resapie?
No midnight snack
Since the germs and bacteria float to the top do they then just go around scooping that out or does it go away on its own overtime??
Beautiful❤🙏
He gets a medal
YOU CAN EAT IT????!!! Wow thats cool!
AGREED!!!
The government is going to kill him just like the man how made cure for aids and cancer. No money to be made with clean water
bless him
Just because it's organic doesn't mean it's healthy or you should eat it...
👍
How exactly does the solution not attract small floating plants n stuff? I mean sure it looks nice to remove it but there are fish who eat that
What a hero and I like that fact that u can eat it
India - i am not interested 😌. Lets call my religious leader.
Lol you barely found this guy??
Omg that is so amazing I am so God is blessing people like this
Bruh i thought that was a field 😳
These are the types of things that make me restore my faith for humanity
This guy should go onto shark tank with this idea
They need to name the lake after him
Wow he is right we do need more people like him
Marino the great hero of saving dirty water to clean water
😐
I know this isnt completely relavent , but just cause its organic doesnt mean its harmless , toxic chemicals are produced ORGANICALLY in many plants
Where is this powder thing I need it
Saludos desde argentina 😁
When he ate it i was like what the....
But how do you get the gunk out?
please come and clean our river ganga
Please provide link, if we can buy his product.
This is already a stage in the water processing plants.
That moment when he says a little bit cleaner … Me: 🥲✌️😬🥺
May I know the solution……
Thank GOD for Marino's Creation And His Wonderful existence in This World🙏
We need this in America
Bro tell me what that powder is it will make the wildlife come back
The Ganga rivers needs that kind of treatment
Ah let's worship greta thunberg instead for regurgitating the same thing about global warming
Why is this guy not blowing up faster than mark rober
Was that in the start even a lake because it looked like grass.
we need mark rober and mr beast on this asap
we need that for Indonesia river 🗿
Not gonna lie I thought that was just land not dirty water
Water can be dirty but still have a thriving ecosystem
Yea we need more like marino
"... And the people did too..." guess it doesn't solve the actual problem then.
We need more people like Marino. No We need his solution 😁😁😁
nasdaily is lime the good side of the news
We need Marino solution
Me(  watching this guy eat his own dirt) : 👁️👄👁️
I am from Peruuuu✨🇵🇪🤣😁😂
huh i guess were not bad at earth sometimes huh
@nasdaily. Can you ask him to visit Sri Lanka. Because with recent disasters our beautiful ocean is polluted ?
The lake is gonna be dirty again when the human bastards come again
Does it taste good 🤔
Grand Salute SIR 🔥🔥🔥 👍👍👍 ❤️
I love how this guy teaches us how to take care of the world properly in just one minute! Keep up the great work 🙏
He is amazing
Cool
What is the solution? Or composition of solution?
Wow 🥺
If you eat it it will clean things from the inside of your body probably like dead cells or something like that 👁️👄👁️
Holy shit
I found a man in my mother's room, who turned my family apart and here is how he did it.
Had to clap for this
You don't need to go to heaven to see   God
MARINO SHOULD BE AWARDED WITH NOBLE PRIZE !!!!!!
papa god says: OH MY GOODNESS A GUY CLEANED THE WATER
Now send him to the ocean. jk
We would be in a better place by right now if the American can do the same
nice accent bro it sounds satisfying to my ear  (its not a sarcasm, it was a compliment)
Hooooold on
A legend.
Bs shit. He didnt invent that lmao. Thats basic chemestry idiot.
But still we need to make our environment clean ☺️ cuz their is more to do any thing but not everything n everywhere.....
Seriously do that! 💖 Hope there will come more of this in the world 🗺 🌍💝
Marmaraya gelsin müsilajı temizlemeye
Cooool
Did anyone notice how he played with words with the word "solution"? He meant that he came up with a solution (solvement of a problem) which is also a solution (mixture) :>
marino , marine... oh makes sense
The sea😐
India be needing him
Wish America used it
'..?'
Plot twist: he only cleaned the lake to see the hot babes in bikinis.
What's the name of the solution?
And it was crazy expensive to clean that lake
Yep we need like that people
Love this man who invented that
He loves lakes sea and etc because he is a marine
In Italy MARINO is a common name, and means “from the sea” as well, so this guy clean lakes, perfect name  NOME OMEN  👍🏻
Let's all unite and call ourselves the chumbucket, to try and steal his recipe so we can eat it instead.
His name fits his job:Marino
Awww j love these people and remember stay strong
Why don’t we just dump a lot of his solution in the ocean
Damn
Legend steps in to improve the world 😁
Wh- But where is the steps on how to make it cleaner? Wh- WHERE IS IT?
𝚆𝚘𝚊𝚑!!!🤩
Give us formula plz
Not a little bit cleaner lets say clean enough
Nice
Whatttt
We need that solution, we all over the world
Saw the solution first and it looked like oats. My thoughts: looks yummy, hope it's edible. Sees that it's edible Me:😆 But seriously, we need ppl like him
I guess it is time to buy and Eat this organic thing to clean my body
What that Marino use? Maybe we can be another morino
They should make a liquid that dissolves stuff like plastic
Organic chlorine?
A real scientist who mut be suported in every way possible .
"A little bit cleaner" He meant 60% cleaner.
Im 14 and i was studying to be a scientist whom would change the world for the better and also be an astrologist this just raised my hopes
I wamt to order this stuff
Respect ++
He found a scientist
We seriously need this in India
Was it a dirty lake or was it duckweed and moss
Why a lil cleaner?
What about people who kill sharks? We need to also stop it 😞 please
Will it make your mawth clean
Please give his contact!
#SaveMotherEarth. I've seen alot of dirty lake.... And they just leaving the dirty lake.. The god would be proud of Jesus of how he made the dirty lake clean :) (of course! Of us too but different)
This one actually is interesting and not just clickbait lol let him form a company and train othet scientists so that this can become a worldwide project. This is really needed in some countries
Where can i buy his solution?
This shows that theres still hope. Beautiful ❤️
Guess humanity still exists
Gajab👌👌👌
In an age where celebrities or tik tokers that are digging in their toes get paid billions more than human beings that mutualy help and respect one another and the environment around them.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Fake and fay.
Wow this is amazing 👏.
I need his contact no. Or email or I mean anything
Can he do the oceans
Can I get some stuff
Fish: so u care for us? 👁👄👄
Obviously he used MSG since he ate it with such glee
What is it called and is it on amazon
How shit thats genius-
Naah we don't need more people like Marino  We need people who just doesn't dirties the lake
Insane. Im so happy we have people like this guy still walk on earth.
So amazing awesome work
ℝ  𝔼  𝕊  ℙ  𝔼  ℂ  𝕋  +
Would be useful for India’s river Ganga
where can we get "His solution" ?
I dont understand if this is that easy of a fix to polluted waters why isn't this used everywhere surely governments see the benefits?
Didn’t mark rober do something like this
Wow he is so bless
What kind of solution is that?
Does he have a go fund me or smtg?
Müsilaj için kullanılabilir!
Amazing thing that can clean water and you can eat it 👍🙏
Good to help nature he is so amazing
Its me-a maarioooo
Wow, this man must be respected even by the goverment.
Marino can sell it and ship it to anywhere. He can make money and save the planet too.
Yes! That's true cause EARTH is going to die because of the polutions and etc.please!!! Help our EARTH to be cleaned!
And the people came back too! Me: isn't that a bad thing?
We will need that in the pasig river, along with the clean up of the squatters and de centralization of our country since Manila is so vulnerable For the squatters, we first need to decentralize our country for them to explore more of the develope cities yet to come and so that the city clean up can start
En México a ese hombre le aplican la de "se suicidó con 27 balazos en la espalda y apareció milagrosamente en una bolsa de basura en un río de otro Estado"
I found no body asked "Can you please tell me what that solution was? I want to apply that in my locality too"
And the fish came back too     :3
Send this to India . FAST!
Eat it  Me - ok so all the particles will come on my throat?
Soo beautiful MY eyes-
nobody needs to know.
HE DESERVES A RAISE
Meanwhile the bottled water companies are sucking up all the lakes
The world will be happy ☺️
I THOUGHT WAS GRASS WITH COWS LOL ITS JUST DIRTY WATER WITH DIRTY PLANTS
Can I buy it if I can I will buy loads of it and try to clean my city lake too
I wanna do this :)
This feels like dhar man
I hope it can makes my dirty brain clean
where's this from I'm literally gonna buy this 😀🖐️
Wow, that is freaking awesome!!!!
"We need more people like Marino" I say we need people to be like Marino.
I literally though the dirty lake(the before and after picture)was grass and land bruh.
MARINO MORIKAWA👏👏
We Indians desperately need this !
This guy saving the earth
Do this to Manila bay haha
Give this man man more respect than celebrities
People also came back huh
Viva el Perú 🇵🇪🇵🇪
Give this man some respects
Honestly sometimes its good to have dirty lakes (please dont scream at me about this)
Bootiful
Organic doesn't necessarily mean safe. Lead is organic.
Wish he could share his formula👍
You can eat it Me:i need those for breakfast
that's why he's name is "Marino"
we need people who eat formulas to see if they're safe ok
This man need to be famous, quickly!
Trade Offer I Receive: Finding for more solution  You Receive: Clean lakes
Respect
🔥 RESPECT 🔥
Ngl at first i thought it was a flat grass island with trees XD
I like marino he is amazing  Pls introduce this solution to everyone
Fine! I'll go put my...  *yard trimmings* ... in a car compactor!
wow😯😯😯👍👍
This is a very bad 👎 😕
Where are they disposing the garbages that floats after the cleaning of water?
If his man doesn’t become a fucking trillionare from this invention of his I will officially just give opup on humanity
No science = Bullshit
We don't need marino to clean the lakes, we need that substance.
Wondorful 👌👌👌
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
good video
1 big step to clean mother nature and her earth
"The humans came back" so anyway I started blasting
Use this around the world specially india💕
Wow😭 Need some to clean my 🇮🇳 And my world
This guy has 1000 iq
Wow amazing 🤩🤩🤩
*G(old)*
I got real concernd for that split second before he said it was safe to eat
This mortal shall live
Mareno I would like your solution I have a river near me thats very dirty
Wait a min u can eat day stuf
Marino: * eats water cleaner *
He should be president
I would love to partner with Marino to help clean Lake Erie. We have terrible toxic algae blooms during summer month's because of fertilizer runoff from crops.
I had to rewatch I thought it was grass at first
Wow. How can i help
i saw this a year ago or 2
There is good in the world, thank you
"The humans came back too!"  The lake : "I don't like where this is going-"
I can eat it!?!
The animals came back  Me : yay! And the humans, did too. Me: bruh.
Omg
I'm from Peru and I didn't know about this until now, he really need to be more recognized
That is amazing
This was a few years ago
God bless this man
Unfortunately poison ivy is also 100% organic.
Nice👌
"and the people did too" NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
😋😘so sweet save the earth
this is what youtube shorts should be
Yes
They need to do this to that river in India. It's extremely polluted.
patent and sell it and he can make millions of dollars and jobs
I'm fine giving the benefit of the doubt but so little was explained here that that substance could have been oatmeal for all I know.
Thats actually his childhood lake he grew up with he was sad seeing it all dirty
He asks for me people like Marino. Boy we can’t just come up with this magic dust that does the same we’re average joes buddy I ain’t no rocket scientist
He needs to go to India!!! ASAP!!
Every time I think I’ve lost all hope with humans and climate change boats make ice and eco friendly cleaning supplies come
What did you do today?
But does it taste good
This channel is awesome... OMG !!! 🤯🤯🤯
Good work.  But dung is 100% organic too.  Organic doesn't mean edible.
But the real question is what does it taste like 😩
Chlorine
Ayeeee represent, but our country is kinda being fucked rn cause of the election
A little bit cleaner? No no no. We shall do this. TO THE OCEANS!
Stockton
Tell Marino thank you from all of Humanity! 😊👍💗
The birds came back and the people did too! (And so did dem crocodiles 😏)
The name “Marino” has gotta be one of the coolest names I’ve heard
Yo you think he could to the Chesapeake bay that stuffs grody
Marino is unique, I respect him
People like him and the kid who started a company to get plastic out of the ocean are the ones who need to be on the news more often, not people who complain about the environment and then fly private jets to news conferences.
I’m also form peru
"He turned this dirty lake, into this"  I'm sorry, was that first picture supposed to be a lake-
Wow i like this  very informative  video.. such wonderful.. ❤️❤️❤️🙏
Sell it worldwide eh?
Aqua: PURIFICATION PURIFICATION PURIFICATION PURIFICATION PURIFICATION
And you my friend we need more people like you as well..
This guy sounds and looks like Japanese
So cool I love ti
Thank you to Marino for saving our environment😘
That super excited and nice probably needs more just like him.
So if the stuff floated to the top... What did he do woth the stuff to leave a clear lake?
Me: becoming like uhh marino yea my family: i-
Isn’t it natural to have a lake that is dirty?
Que pro el peruano
We shouldn’t think “we need more people like him” we should be like him
Porfin latinoamerica
But what's in his solution and how do we get it world wide so we can care for the earth? That's the important info being left out
Isn't there already a powder like this that is dirt cheap?
Everyone says we need more people like him But NO ONE said i wanna be like him.. Save Mother Earth..every little contribution counts..
This guy is kinda cute
Soy de Perú y no sabía eso
Idk why y'all think humans always cause this shit
"Roses are dead🥀" "Violets are dying" "Outside im smiling😃" "Inside iam crying" "I wish people would notice my  content💻"
So he created flocculant?
💯 % BULLSHIT 💩
that is amazing!! would come in handy at my local lake, you can barely see 3 feet deep
Should have told us the ingredients
Wow that is incredible
But when you clean all the dirty lakes in the world where does all the dirt go
You need to put this shit in the Brisbane lake
Where can get the solution to clean it?
Can i order that one?
4+5+8+0+3+76+100 equals ?
Marino's fresh i ain't go lie 😳 that flow is on point fr
What is his solution?
We don't need like more Marino, all we need to do is practice and apply our water waste management properly..
I want this shit for my pool
You are a thief.
Yet another time where man thinks they can control anything.  2 years from now we will find out that was the worst thing he could have done.
Now I want to clean my towns dirty pond
Not big on all the nature stuff because it's mostly an economical thing where companies profit off more than a problem the size it's made out for but this is genuinely awesome! He can get some well deserved stacks with that
> *exaggerated & obnoxious YouTuber manner of speech* > *doesn't even say the name of the organic powder is* > *no links for donating to Marino*  > *mentions "and the people are back" like it's a good thing* > *emojis*
Turning a dirty like into a clean one if it’s just a swamp might be bad for the environment
I hope he actually named it SOLUTION
So proud of him
He's a hero
Marino is a lake saver🙂
Why israel attack palestin
go to afrikaaaaa
But not just 1 Lake all the oceans
NO I HAVE HOPES FOR THE CORAL REEF
Bro, this is revolutionary! How have I not heard about this guy?! Is he famous in his country, Peru?
That must have took aong time
Why are you reuploading videos
Great!!!
Woah-
No no send the people back. It's gonna get dirty again
Ggwp Marino, God bless you
Marino, no no Marinooooohh ooh yaa Marino Marino no no no noooo
Whoelse agrees that he's more like Japanese.
“So eco friendly you can eat it” humans can eat planes if they felt like it so idk what kind of point that makes but not nearly as impressive as he thought
Mlb fans be like: uhh- mArInEtTe?
Not all dirty lakes are contaminated.
YESSSSS THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN HAS HOPE
My soul left my Body when he ate this powder
Well Flint still doesn't have clean water
the repost legend
What that was water?
Well we need this for Ganga
Yeah, have fun trying to get the us to fully do all of this! Nobody will volunteer..
Lol good job 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Marino Is not a man, he is the man.
This was done in 2018. You might be asking why you haven't seen it done. The answer from him is because it was expensive. He even had to use his own money and well, no one wants to invest in it because it doesn't make any money for the private companies or investors. There you have it. If you think your "trust in humanity is restored", think again.
......SHARE THE GOSPEL AND REPENT OF YOUR SINS AND BE BORN AGAIN KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS AND ONLY WORSHIP THE ONE AND ONLY JESUS AND HE LOVES U SHARE THIS WITH ALL THE PEOPLE U KNOW.
Sooo instructions not clear…. Guess we will rely on this marino guy….
So why didn't you tell us the name of his magic powder? Think we'd all like to know.
Good idea 👍
Now we clean the Ohio River.
oh! I think I remembered this from somewhere he cleaned the lake because it was his childhood place or sumn :o
And the people came back too, frick no...
Good guy
How did it taste
Ganges River- “Hmmmmmmmmmmm….”
How can I get that solution...?  Online shopping...?!
Nice🙏
We need more people like Marino
Im in love with this man!This could save so much lakes!
Wait can you drink the water
That is awesome.
Doom slayer but his profession is pool cleaning
PORRIDGE
That lake was so dirty it looked like land
That's y human did not extint over time
Yesssss make Le world cleaner
You cannot slap organic onto anything and eat it 🤦‍♂️ I mean, shit is pretty organic. Or table salt is completely inorganic, yet you eat it all the time. Stop being stupid and just think for once.
We should do that to the Mississippi/ Missouri River! When we went to that River on mother's day for my mom, we found the head of a giant fish on the concrete. And that is a great mother's day gift! Lol
“It’s so eco friendly you can eat it.” ????????
La concha de la lora como que la gente vino de vuelta se contamina otra vez xd
Right that guy, i remember watching a video about him a few years ago...
People need to get this man on large scale production now😳
i will like and reply to every reply on this comment
Uranium is also 100% organic
Imagine him making it 100x more power full then in seconds the ocean is clean
So we need more scientists
That so cool like it can literally save the earth
Imaging taking a old video from Facebook and reposting it on your channel to get views and monetization.
Amazing guy the name Marina like Mario from maskot Nintendo have a Good day
Not all Heroes wear capes, marino proved that right
capitalist be like : ooohh new tourist attractions let's make profit 😂
That is so Eco-Friendly!
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life... Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand repent of your sins .Jesus died and rose on the third day in victory against death follow him🙏
Support people like this 🇮🇳💪💪🇮🇳
So this guy could have just ended dirty drinking water in Africa
I think the US needs to buy this for like Detroit and flint and stuff like that
good jop marino💜
عاشت فلسطين حرة
Why did the lake become so dirty?
This guy will be the savior of our planet
Marino help the world
Can we clean Ganga 😀
Dude’s got to go to Africa and India
Truly inspiring, i love science!
Damn Get it👀
Not going to lie why can't he be my teacher for science
This man has done 10x more work than Greta has, these are the people we should celebrate.
Marino ain't human, he's a superhuman
being organic doesn't make it safe to eat, hemlock is organic.
HE NEEDS TO SELL THIS TO THE GORNMENT 😱
A'it ,I'm Anon'I What's the deal?
It was so green I thought it was grass
😞 they're gonna kill this man now
scientists who is trying to fill the ENTIRE ARIZONA CANYON THING be like: if we get marinos powder thing, the entire canyon will change to a orange canyon to a blue canyon
You are destroying the food of micro organisms,plankton, fish and the whole eco system.. Natural is always best..
yes more marinos and less thunbergs
I want the whole world to be cleaned
Why isn’t this everywhere????
As a Peruvian I'm proud 👏💙😌❤
Or just use chlorine 😂
he is a true hero
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔺
What's marino Instagram?
PHILLIPPINES NEED THIS
He deserves an award
This is the type of person that deserves a Nobel price not some 60 year old politician
Next step, Galveston Bay
What does it tastes like
I'm not seeing any proof of anything. A dude named Marino, two pictures of possibly the same lake. A 1 minute video is BS for actually providing any factual information.
It's desiccated coconut
Was this video written for 5 year olds?
What is the recepi to the clearing thing
Just drop this over China and India.
This guy is awesome..respect
Elon and jeff bezos better buy this stock or istg im suing hem for anti eco propagands
When he poured it in the water I already was like "man I want to eat that for some reason" , if it wasn't edible I would have still eaten it.
OMG THAT'S AWESOMEEE
Poison is also organic, so I can eat it too? Oh thanks!
So uh…. Why are we not funding this???!!! Dude should be fucking Director of EPA
Wow this scientist is super inttelgent 😉😉
https://youtu.be/L08ZR1FB2pA
Wow love
But where can we found more people like this?
I know something organic that cleans water in minutes as well... it's called wood ash and charcoal... and yes you can eat that as well without any health consequences.
That was a lake? It looked like land!
Terrific
Just like that one episode where Katara cleans the lake..if im not mistaken
im sick of his reuploads
"The humans came back too"  Ah shit, here we go again
Alguien que hable español ? Xd
Wtf is it real??
His name says it all. Italians will understand xD
How long y’all think it is until the government kills him and makes it look like he “mysteriously disappeared”
Ah yes i could drink the whole lake XD
Ah yes i could drink the whole lake XD
I thought there would be a twist at the end because it sounded like an infomercial  Nope! 🙃
This channel really inspires me to keep moving on no matter what life throws at us like covid-19

It's true! Like Earth countryballs Is sad and hurt because of dirty lakes
Take this idea to Clearlake ca they need it there
I wish this type of people should born in future

Most wholesome youtuber?

Can someone tell me what is the solution is to clean the water

The sad part is that I know who Addison Rae is and I just found out who this man is. And its not only because of my own ignorance.

Hero:D
“The birds came back”: 📈📈📈📈 “And the people did too”: 📉📉📉📉
👍
All that work for essentially nothing.
Man oh man someone in India at least definitely needs to know this. There are dirty lakes hecking EVERYWHERE in my area.
That is amazing ! Good job,Marino
Starts turning people into swamp monsters
so we are not gonna talk that,  "we can have lake in our stomach too "
Is it irony that his name is Marino?
So why the f is Marinos product not used every where? Ive seen that video of him years ago… literally the whole world could use that and its 100% organic? So it shouldn’t be too hard or expensive to mass produce right?
But Marino is Japanese does he really live in Peru?
Noo hoomans!
he finds everyone like they have been lost long
Wow. I'd really love to know more
Why are there pink flamingos in the lake? I’m concerned
We NEED to be like Marino! He is true hero we seriously need to increase the amount of things we do to save earth! 😄✊🏼👏👏🌱🌳
What does Marie told me he leaves it anyways I mean not you Siri I just mean what kind of Hous
Sana ag tubig sa India malinis din.
His videos always leaves a smile on my face
His name makes my feel special only cause it’s almost like mines
youre right we need like Marino
Take it to India or all slums. Would be good.
The goverment of Peru to support hum by cleaning all the dirty lakes in the world
ive realised he normally wears a shurt saying 38% life byt today it says 37% percent ik its random lol
Didn’t Mark Rober show one that made the contamination sink
If he doesn’t sell that he needs to
These are the real superhero dude
I literally went to a rave in a foreign state and had a crazy time then came home to now watching a guy clean his lake but really it was just an ad 😭😭😭
His name sounds like a brand 👁️👄👁️
Those are two completely different lakes just look at the mountain
Yep...Hiding garbage somewhere else isn't gonna make the Planet clean....
Amazing 🙏
We need that in India too 🇮🇳
outstanding thankyou sir
His solution, is his solution
shit its bad that im living on amur river
The thing is.. how? :(
What was the name of solution
When he said *"in Peru"* I felt that
We don't need someone like him we have to become like him then n then only something like this will happen..
i wish there was no corona then all the cerens mest it up
Avatar Aang did that years ago
Everyone become scientists, is what this video is saying

I remember watching this 2 years ago.

Wrong that's 59 seconds not 1 minute
Marino seems like that one proud friendly uncle
YA WE Need to
Please pray for my mom who's in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for her life against this virus for 5 weeks now and not looking good with multiple infections. Her name is Doris. I don't have much family and we're very close. If you can take a second to pray for her please.

Africa

I also need that  Powder
Moreno

How can you eat the solution 🤔
Yess we need him because earth is dieing and this dude probably might save the world
Imagine if everyone was marino. We can clean every beach and ocean
“we need more people like Marino” we need to *be more* like Marino  edit: to clear things out, (so y’all people don’t come at me) what I meant is, we need to stop littering and help Marino to reduce the pollutions. (as well as those volunteers who clean the beach) Basically stop polluting and help picking up trash. And just because this comment has the same idea as the comments y’all probably read somewhere (like I did) doesn’t mean it’s stolen _!!_  *jeez*  edit: English isn’t my native so hope y’all understand my trashy grammar.
Were did the big ass island in the middle go on the before and after photos
Cool my name is Marino
How is this not big news if it's so simple? Something doesn't add up... 🤷
Just throw that stuff in every lake and ocean.
."we need people like marino" y'all... I want to clean our planet too but im dumb asf
We need to save the world that's why he's cleaning
Marino's stomach must be incredibly clean
So so so so nice and your right we need more people to help
Mario?
But.... Whats the solution
Wow 😯 Marino is so amazing  🤩
100% organic doesn't automatically mean safe for consumption.
Woooowww
Hi guysss, I just posted my own cover of Traitor by Olivia Rodrigo, could someone pls check it out or tell me how to improve? Sorry for the annoying promo, didn’t mean to annoy but I’m having great difficulty getting any exposure and idk what else to do🥺❤️ thank you for ur time❤️❤️❤️
Brilliant
you still not verified, you must be gay
Love his name so much
I LOVE HIM❤️❤️❤️
There's a lot of people that are crazy but this guy is amaziny
This video just screams clickbait fakery.
Marino is a hero
Putting guys name in description would have been great
Bhuvaneshwar lite😂😂😂
I hope he didn’t just destroy a local environment lmao
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
I suspect his solution is actually a suspension
That's really impressive and I can imagine that he gets a millionair with this product ppl would Def pay bunch of money for that
Di indo sampah plastik
Ok so 2 things its fake af, or if it's real give out the ingredient
He deserves an award
The Lake looked Like a forest to me
Basically the opposite of pool chlorine
Japanese peruvian
This guy deserves a fucking award or smth wtf
We need that chemistry and get Australia s giant lake in the middle
Dangerously stupid. Organic does not mean safe to eat. Nature is full of organic poisons. The safety of eating that stuff has nothing to do with it being organic.
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you, and died for our sins.  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of God .

5in is the only one I know who has the best of it and the president of our country and we are not the ones we want but he has no f we have a very strong relationship
This can also be done by bleaching powder to clean the water
This man deserves a medal
"People did too"  Marino : bruh
Спасение пропащего водоёма. Часть 57. Надумываем над расширением.
Poor guy, he will probably "commit suicide" but the government will kill him 'cause he is in LATAM :( I'm from there too and when someone create something similar they kill them because it affects to the rich people business :(  The situation in LATAM Is horrible:(
Now that's what am talking about
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
I’m fixing to buy that stuff just to eat it. I am such a fat ass
❤
You know what , I'd say it's AMAZING that birds are back and EQUALLY BAD that humans are too , honestly, we rarely know to take care. Pretty sure we'll contaminate it again hoping he'd clean all that again
Give me that powder
The birds: "Clean innit"
Powder name
🔥 🔥 🔥
You did a lazy job with the photos the building magically appeared in the background during transition
What's the solution
Ironic his name is Marino lol
The stuff is cool and he is cool as well but HE EAT THE STUFF!?
That was a lake
👍👍👍
Indonesia need this
Fantastic!! I hope he will sell his formula.
He cleans a lake and you just make a 1min video 🤦 we need more!
Where does it go when it comes to the top
he looks like the guy from rio
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
Can he clean it
The humans came back too  The lake- pls don't
how about in the philipines the pasig riverr
Praying Tanaka is so happy to have stumbled upon your channel.
We shouldn’t think “we need more people like him” we should be like him
Omg I forgot about this!!!
"The birds came bacc" 🥳🥳😇 "And the people did too" Ah sh!t here we go again 🤢
I like that guy my fav food is san marino tuna fish and his name is marino
i dont like the statement of *"we need  more (insert name here)"* it only means *"why work when others are like him"*
It takes more to make than what it gives
Organic =/= edible!!!!
This could save our future  😃
I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️ I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️ I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️ I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️ I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️ I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️ I MISS THE RAGE ⁉️
Repost

👏👏👏👏
I thought the before pictures were hills 🤢🤮
https://youtu.be/TLd7S4txeYM
Marino sir give the ingredients to indian people so that they can help in cleaning Ganges river

https://youtu.be/etzlivcCFYs
Nasdaily run out of videos to show amazing people or things  Also nasdaily making shorts 😀
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
If you keep the formula a mystery, the number of lake cleaners will remain one.
looks like cereal
Is it just me who’s wondering where did he throw away the trash?
If people came back then in about 3-4 years, the lake will be dirty again
Reposted?
Thought the dirty water was grass
Just because something is organic or eco friendly doesn't mean you can always eat it lol. Maybe you can eat this guy's miracle lake cure, but I don't recommend eating a spoon full of dirt unless you want a tape worm, because that's organic too.
Gg, now you are 37 y/o
Don't say we need more people like him, be like him!
This is fake
Do this in Manila Bay 😭
No, what we need is more of that wonder solution
Two W with O in middle WOW
That person in the water cant swim
india needs this guy because people are polluting the rivers so much that the rivers flow is literally depleting every year .
👨‍🔬 👖
Him:"that's why I cleaned an whole lake by myself and many more, what are you doing, you can't even clean your bathtub"
Hay q orgullo
Bruh I need this for my pool
advertising?
We don't need more people like marino       We need to ve like marino
“Who ate all the lake substances”!?
Yessssss
Awesome! He needs to go around the world with his formula! This world needs help!
Let's gooi
"The birds came back" - Good good  "& so did the humans" - All hope is lost
The Lorax
GUYS I JUST SET OFF A SMOKE BOMB IN 2 SHOP'S ..... I farted
Who wants to do this in Galveston with me
I definitely agree with you like our polluted with trash and even the air
When he ate it I was like wtf  "100% organic" organic how?
When I saw Marino solution first I was like yummy 😋 and then I heard him say it’s eatable 😳
had a semi heart attack when he ate it for some reason
I like how his concoction floats and the other dude's concoction sinks
I remember learning about Marino's work 2 years ago. It's really really great and he needs all the funding he can get because his solution is no cheap feat. His plan and execution is very positive and healthy and sincerely he deserves all the support
Yes we do! And more people like you!
Wow, why is his formula not being used worldwide? Amazing 🥰
I hope nas  can do my country Trinidad
what is the ingredient or solution?  might be helpful if you actually mentioned that...
"and the people did too."  Im seeing a pattern that Im not sure if I like
Me: *watching this* Me: We have free tea in Malaysia Me quietly say: We need you to come to Malaysia
Peruvian Pride 🇵🇪❤️
Hat's off marino
Dude I didnt know the first image was the lake I thought it was a firld
Careful, he’s a hero
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Marino necesitamos de tu solucion aca en Argentina!
Denki would love this 🗿
Please dump that in Galveston,Tx
Can he clean a river at Thailand
Gila sih
Hey, mushrooms are 100% organic and they can kill, smh
Bhut is still there
We need you !
I ate some and now I feel like harry potter
That's so cool
Me already see so many people in tiktok cleaning water soo ill try to join if i can
WELL THEN WATS STOPPING US???  THE BIG CORPORATIONS !!! THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE BILLIONS . THEY WILL BUY MARINO INGREDIENTS N HIS SILENCE ! THEY WILL COLLUDE WITH THE POLITICIANS N TOGETHER THEY WILL SPIN THE NARRATIVES THAT WE GOT TO SAVE THE PLANET N BLAME IT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. GET FUNDING FROM THE GOVT N THEY BOTH LIVE HAPPILY EVERAFTER  !!!  YOU SEE FRIENDS , THE POLLUTION STARTS WITH ONE WORD "GREED "!! MORAL OF THE STORY : THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE MARINO BUT THEY EITHER BOUGHT OVER BY GREED OR DESTROYED BY GREEDY PEOPLE !!!
yeet the people out the lake
Marino means marine
the only part i didn't like about this is the "the people came back too"  think about the people of today who can't even tell where their trash goes to
We’re do you by that stuff I need that really bad
Marino you better be smiling u angel!
Solution get it
Someone did this before him
Nas: the birds come back. *And the people too* To be honest i can assure you as long as theres people that lake will become dirty again cuz thats what people do, destroy the earth "the only planet that has the capability to sustain life"
Save the world
Absolute genius
Haha, can save those African people
orgullo peruano
It would take a long to clean Minnesota. They dont call it home to 10,000 lakes for no reason
I was like:"hes gonna eat the powder"         Me later:"he actually did"       Edit:"how did this get so many likes? I just comment bc i was bored"
I watched your videos then I watched u on Dhar mann  My respect for you has raised
Let go marino
What does it taste like
We need to be more like him
Damn I was wondering wether he actually did this or not, I’m glad he did eventually clean the lake
Soooo what are the Ingredients? If everyone knew it then we could save so many countries struggling with water sources. Saving the planet shouldn't come with a price and if it was me I'd literally use that power the make a change and save the planet but everyone wants money and that's why we'll be all dead within a few years.
Can i get this for my pool
What? That’s it? What is the stuff????!
Is this for real?
Cringe
This was already made before he came out with it
I love this guy,he reports all the good things that are very unnoticed and reports them to the world and it makes my day wherever I am and in whatever situation
Bro come to india
I think humans Should only be able to use man-made bodys of water
Wasn't he japanese
His name bruh he was made for this
Is he Peruvian tho ? He looks and sounds exactly like a japanese
We need to not just clean the lakes but the ocean because we have Marino let's go guys
All the people crying about swimmers and people enjoying the water
After the cleaning you  eating OWS that gross
Wher you buy this stuff
Marino can be rich if he uses that 💰
True Legend
Nice job marino
Looks like oatmeal to me
Why is alway 1 minute pls 2 or more minute because you have cool contents
Yesssssss   we   more  people like  Marino😇😇🤓✌
We need this world wide
Good shit good shit 😎
some animals need dirty lakes for bacteria they consume
Why are all these peoples name so accurate?
Another man made the same thing but it all floats to the bottom
This guy needs to hire a bunch of people and sell this thing world wide! He will be an billionare in an instant
i need to save this but how 😩
Is this real? Too many fake this i wonder if this is one of them
And thats how we clean swimming pools :D
Maybe the Indian govt can use this to clean Ganga instead of spending so much money and not getting anything out of it.
We need the united states to freaking look as beautiful as Sweden.
We need that in the Philippines so many water pollution 😅
Ngl marino should be in control of the stuff bc the government doesn't care
It's just like philipines
Yeah but where not gonna get more people dont care abt this
hol up, let me eat my water cleaning solution
O
this is insane. we should put this everywhere
Nice next do the Gamges River
He can eat it... Because it's organic!  Bruh dog shit is organic and arsenic is organic... You gonna eat those too?
It is 100 percent organic is not a good reason to eat something. So are poisonous berries, spider venoms, snake venoms, many poisonous fungi etc.
Wowwwww
まりのさんって日本人なのか I didn’t know that Marino is japanese..
Well, if it is that good, why hiding?
We need this solution everywhere
balatonra ez raferne
People come again rip lake😬
"Podemos limpar todos os lagos do mundo" quero ver quando ele descobrir o  Tiete
What’s the solution
Fucking legend why tf isn't this guy in the hall of fame fr
MAKE A COMPANY WITH THIS PRODUCT DUDE DO IT. YOU WILL EARN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
WOAH HE MADE THE BACKGROUND BUILDINGS BETTER 😀
his full name is Dr.Marino Morikawa
Im cried
Yeah, but I doubt most people would put the effort to even do this. Even when it could help us a lot.
Sadly, my ministry of ambience hasn't  supported him in this project as far as I know. :/
We need something like that in Marmara Sea too Before mucilage wipes out the entire Mediterranean
This is so old
Marino op
He gotta do this to the ocean
Product name please.
Give me thoseeee ingridients so i can swim on our lake again
Wow this is hope
But what about the dirty air
if i have the money i can be like marino
Amazing
If we had more people like Marino we wouldn't just clean the lakes we're changing the world to a better place for animals and ourselves! 😀🥰😊
Dont you try to clean some lakes in russia there's some radioactive pollution in it
I’m going to Peru and bring back some of the stuff cause that shart must work well to turn that stuff clean ✋🏼
Awesome
You know it’s good when he proves it by eating it
But if all humans come back to lake, it goes back to dirty.
Marino has the respect of the nigga cat  council
Wow!!!   So aside from finding 215 buried Indigenous persons in Kamloops, Canada 🇨🇦 [Residential Schools 1996] We have more than 165 communities in Canada without clean drinking water, some - for 25+ years.  Solutions like these are life changing for even "1st world" countries like Canada!!
That reminds me of that one episode from avatar the last airbender
Everybody else: omg this could help so many people❤️❤️  Me: Ayo, did he just eat f*ckin sawdust?
If his first name was san  then he is San Marino
I love that guy he's awesome
Wait till the dinosaurs come back
God bless marino
Where can I find this stuff to eat as a snack
Someone has to buy like 10 gallons of this and put it in the ocean
It's so sad to know that we already have the solution to clean lakes and help so many third world countries but corporations don't want to invest in that because it would cost too much money and they don't want to help people less fortunate than them.
Ocean
"You can eat it because it is completely organic"  Ya shit's organic too, but I wouldn't wanna eat that.
It sucks that the government is going to want to kill him for his great work, just like the guy who made a car that ran on water
Ayo we got a guy to represent Peru lessss goooooo
Amazing
This is just insane
I haven’t seen a comment about this but...  is it just a similarity his name is Marino  Like super water related?? And he cleaned an entire lake. Like... was he born to do this job?
We need more government that support works from people like Marino, because this things wasn't free
the reason why poeple don't pay attention to this and like big companies and governments because its very expensive they would rather spend their money on weapons for wars than important stuff like that
Wow
Bruh add instant oatmeal
Where you buy💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥
Science
Love it I'd buy some
Pls I thought he was togashi at first hsgdhdjsj the need for more hxh chapters is killing me I swear vdhshaddhdghdidi
WHY DOESN’T THIS EXISY EVERYWHERE???
wow 💕🌱🕊🙏💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Marino: finished cleaning this lake! Marino: *ima eat some of my solution.  Yum*
Can I just point out that what he put in looks like the hay they put in hamster cages?
Oh the pollution
If only he could commercialize his product for people to buy it
Is that oats? Tf
That look like flakes
He put a teaspoon of that stuff in a glass of water and then he had to Stir It and it's supposed to soak up the contamination from what I could see of the lake it has algae all over it if he'd done that to the lake what did he used to scoop the stuff out of the lake that was floating on top and where did he dumped it and what did he use to stir the stuff he put in the lake so that to soak it up muddy water will clear itself by sinking to the bottom had to use something to scoop that stuff out of the lake or with time it sunk to the bottom so the contamination is still there if he just dumped that stuff on top of the lake and left it is still be floating or with time it sinks or did the fish eat all the contamination which contaminated the fish not to mention the Birds 2 another biohazard ideal
Marino is a shopping mall where I live 😂😂😂😂
Don't say we need people like him 'become like him
Is it good for fish? If people fished there.
"we need more people like marino"  doesnt even say the name of the product or where you can get it
Question is, how did the lake get so dirty in the first place?
Wow
Damn imagine that at the Mississippi lake
Take it to India and their dirty lakes
Oh like that rocket scientist guy
We want to know what the stuff is
We really, really need more people like Marino
Fake
I like this guys content
If the people were this dude the world would be healthy and not ruined by gas and etc
Fun fact: In italian Marino means marine
Ay get Jeff bezos or Elon musk 2 invest make the world better
I mean this already existed before. Mark Rober made a video about it
It's good when the lake is contaminated by something there shouldn't be, like chemicals or plastic or something But in lakes, where just the mud is making the water dirty, you should let it be...
MARINOOO
0:04
Some creatures might live in dirty water and can't live without it. Clean like a fourth we have killed enough species already
Nobody realized that this video was published 1 year ago and its a short right now or is it just me
This channel gives me hope for the earth
Marino is A Unlazy Person and cleans the whole earth this men is so cool
Put it the river Thames right this minute that river is beyond contaminated
That’s so cool
Thankyou Marino , you showed we can do anything if we have the will too. Respect
Love the 1 minute stories
Time to invent the polution cleaner
Take it to the Ganges
I bet if it gets big enough country’s with dirty water could use this like parts of Africa with bad water if they use it they may have good drinking water
Now give that to India
Godbless you
He need to visit Kolkata
Doesn't cloudy water give you UTI's though
Marino is Zeke in disguise and that solution contains spinal fluid
wow
This just gives me hope for the future
This is the coolest dood ever
I mean not to brag, but I can consume 100% INORGANIC material every day. I drink like a whole gallon of dihydrogen monoxide. So, best that.
We need more people like nas to keep showing us these people
i want marinos necklace
This Guy deserves  Respect and Support from everyone 🙏🙏💖
Can it actually attract "ALL" the contaminated particles... I mean different kinds of particles have different chemical composition, right? I'm not a chemistry specialist or anything btw.... I'm just curious and want to know the answer to it... Any scientists here?
And the life then exist in lake were they will go?
If everyone was like this guy, the world wouldn't be so fucked.
We need Marino in Ghana 🇬🇭 to help clean up our water bodies
Not a little bit all the lakes
Uno de los pocos peruanos que se respetan.
marino come to brazil here we have Rio Tietê and Rio Pinheiros, they are very dirty, we need you
Goddamm I gotta get in on This!😊
What a brilliant idea. I will turn the lake into a large bowl of oatmeal
If his "invention" was really all that good to clean the lake then why are people still complaining about polluted lakes rivers and oceans all over the world if it's that life changing wouldn't he like sell it to the government or somebody to clean the oceans instead of keeping it to himself for one little lake because then everybody would have clean water
Need motivation, change ur name closer to the topic ur working on, srsly it helps
Awkward swimming
The painted lady🌚
What is the thing he made called
He deserve Nobel peace price
My day is now better
How much solution do you need per gallon of water?
Get lots of helicopters and fly over oceans like Santa Monica
i mean this was already done by mark rober but ok
Hi Marino you’re cool
Nas is so important to this planet right, this is just one man out of billions with one solution, Nas just took it worldwide. The problem is.... Will people listen... Someone call elon musk on this guy
Where can I buy this
Marino is an og
Those pool cleaners on tik tok are *quaking*
It'd be so awesome if he could mass produce it and sell it everywhere or something
The question is does it attract micro plastics? That would be a real game changer.
Maybe not lake anymore, maybe sea
Love his accent
Maybe the oceans 🤔
This makes me so happy
Jesus is coming back so you guys need to repent from your sins and please spread the gospel and please give your life to Jesus
Honestly but after watching your video me and  everybody get another level of motivation ❤️😊 so thanks
God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son so whoever should believe in him will not perish but have everlasting life
Jesus is the way the truth the life
Jesus is coming back so you guys need to repent from your sins and please spread the gospel and please give your life to Jesus
Wasn’t there another one that makes all the stuff fall to the bottom? Does that mean he had to clean his whole lake? Lmao
Ok this guy is amazing also this can rly help out Africa and other place a lot!! ♥️♥️
😿 Hello scientists, start the adventure
Can i drink the water also
Thats fucking 1 mintue see you tommorow 🤣🤣🤣
Can I get into the next video? I am the world champion in hibernation
I heard this was like is fsmily lake or he lived by it when he was young and missed it being there or something ( trmell me if im wrong) so he made that so it could return to its old beatug
Yep, it's LATAM ,he's going to "suicide" with 7 rifle shots in the back :/
Marino ,Do you want me to sell this product? I am from India

ship this to every country non stop
Is this chemical for sale?
Fun fact: Marino means Marine in spanish
Proud of you😍
“Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness,idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” -Galatians 5:19-21. Even committing one sin makes you deserving of hell. Even if was just a little white lie or something small you stole like a pencil. Sin is that serious because sin is was causes death, pain, sadness, and suffering. But, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. “For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.”-John 3:16–17. If you believe Jesus is God, that He died on the cross for all our sins, rose from the dead three days later,  acknowledged and repent of your sins to God (don’t just say, I’m sorry that I’m a sinner and then continue to lie, steal, cuss, commit adultery, etc. Have a godly repentance, which means your are truly sorry and your want to change your wicked ways), and trust and love in the Lord our God alone, then you will be saved!  “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” -Jesus!!! 😁✝️❤️ But don’t wait to give your life to the Lord because once you die, it will be too late to repent and trust in Jesus our Lord! Think about this, you have NO CLUE when you will die! You could die tonight in your sleep, or even in the next few minutes and you would even know! That’s why you have to give your life to the Lord now! The Bible says in James 4:14, “whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.” And in Ephesians 2:8 it says “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,” There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that you can do to get saved, EXCEPT for repenting of your wicked ways, believing that Jesus is God and believing in what He did for us (died on the cross for all our sins and rose three days later), and transferring the trust you have in yourself and giving it all to GOD! COMPLETELY and ONLY trust in our GOD (don’t trust anyone or anything else)!!! GOD LOVES YOU SOOOOO much, that it is incomprehensible!!!  God DOES NOT want you going to hell and HE is trying To SAVE YOU!!! GOD is calling you RIGHT NOW!!!! ✝️❤️U😁
Damn so cool
Can we clean the ocean too
The only good youtube shorts series. Finnaly
HUGE RESPECT FOR THIS GUY,i hope more ppl wil folow in his step an do the same we all need that, our world need that

Wait but you said that hes from Japan and now hes from peru
The real G of the world
That's actually something to be proud of.
So what happens to your body when you eat it then...
To make a cleaner world? Then what happens with all the contaminated particles, like plastics and stuff... Burned or something? Or thrown into a huge pit or the ocean?
Anyone else mixed up the water as part of the land because of how dirty it was?
Bruh give us the recipe and let's make a change instead of talking about it lol
Everybody is saying we need more people like Marino but no one is saying we need to be more like marino
Someone made the same thing but the dirt goes down
Worlds best poolman

Any business man/woman willing to invest into him?
Do you think people like this amar guy can clean India's lakes and rivers hope so 🙏👍one day they will 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
That's really cool until you just know that he's going yo get fought against for that
It didn't speak to 'HOW' he did it so much as 'THAT' he did it w/o identifying the compound he utilized or the time/ quantity needed to accomplish this...☆☆☆
Allah says in the Quran we taught man what he knew not.
We need this everywhere
I need him on my country right now
Whats the name of the product?
Found out about this a few days ago. I love watching his videos a lot. His voice is nice to listen to and the topic he discusses are interesting!
We need that to clean Ganga after the amount of waste put in it
I love these scientists so much
Plot Twist: Man introduces new foreign organism into lake and kills all native plant life.
If one man can do this imagine what many can!
Why isn't this a global trend rn
This is one of the best inventions I have heard
Wow bro
Plot twist: Mario Forgot About his real name
its alwasy, we need more people like ____ but never, i should be like ____. this is the problem. people expect others to do it for them
He is so cool. Could I have his infor? I want to adopt his solution for my local lake
I like this man
Philippines need that
We need to thank this guy
I thought there was already a scientist who did this, except the dirt sunk to the bottom, check out Mark Rober he has a vid on it.
we need this in India
Every country should hire this guy
LET ME GET YOUR WHOLE PACK! We gonna save the world now bois
Me: Did he say organic?!? Mommmmm Mom: what? Me: can we get this please?  Mom: ok but you better eat it *My family eats organic foods 😋 *
And the people did too....ahhh shit here we go again
Japanese scientists in Peru putting DMT in the water

I have just one question where do you get the cleaning materials from
Yoooo let’s go Marino
He ate it
What is the the stuff put in the lake?
Respect af
Dude this man needs to go on a world trip to clean up everything and the WHO should pay for it
So he can do it in the ocean?
The first time I seen that picture I thought that was the ground
If we know what is ingredient then we will save aquatic animals
The birds came back : this one sparks joy  And so did the people : this one doesn't spark joy
I like you voice marino
he NAS, tell him to sell his solution online with the name "Marino Solution" so that people can recognise ot from this video. We'll buy it, use it and keep our surroundings clean
GOOD JOB FOR MARINO!💙HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB!!HE SAVE THE WORLD!HE SAVE LAKE HE SAVE DUCKS💚I wnna be like him i wnna save the world just like him!💛💙💚✨
This guy need more credit. His videos are just awesome. I get to know so many more things.
holy fucking shit this guy a legend
can somebody hust point out how lovely marino’s accent is?
pov: he just took wheat and ate it so it looks like the solution
But what he spraying with the hose? Chlorine?
Why isn't he being awarded something?! This is HUGE! The amount of contamination that can be cleaned up because of this man's invention! Any country with a lot of pollution like China and India should be friggin fighting over this stuff with how contaminated their water ways are.
Will your stomach be cleaned too if you eat it?
Come on if you want more people like him give us the ingredients
Mashaallah
If he could does in large scale I wouldn't mind throwing my money to him
It was so dirty, I thought it was ground
Please go visit Dr. Phunsuk Wangdu and SECMOL. You would be shook , who agrees.
People came back to .. 😑😑
Marino my man bro you should get Nobel prize for this
Somewhere on the internet, a forum was full of people disliking his effort to restore the lake
No...  WE need to be like Marino
This guy wasn’t the first to come up with this
Marino: Ok so that's it we just clean the lake. 10 MONTHS LATER Marino: Its dirty again????  Yeah we do need more people like Marino
Hi!  I'm a big fan of ur vids and I was curious the cleaning solution for the lake was?
Yeah everyone is right and my grandma always watching you videos and that name is my grandma,s name
That guy is an absolute legend
Damn physically and metaphorically making waves
"That you can eat it"  Me : ah yes we discovered it INFINITY FOOD
what's bam?
This guy is the person to save the world
There was a lil regret in Marino’s face when he ate that
".....The birds came back .....and the people did too !" Ofcourse so that they can again contaminate the lake!!
Clean are New York water please
They should not allowed people come back in the lake, it turned to pretty just to be polluted again
I don't really care how much time you take from me, as long as you gave us a useful knowledge, we don't really care but in fact I think people love it
How does this video not have more likes
We destroy and we try to rebuild.
Ok now whats the problem with it ?
At first I thought it was a part of the ground-
it is so clean we can't even tell the difference between the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean
What a dude!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow that's awesome
I wish that we had this solution in India but unfortunately we don't have.    In Mumbai our sea is so much dirty and other lakes to 😔
Oh I really need that solution to clear the lakes in my city 🤔 what is it 🙏 please do tell

Nas my mom has been a fan of you since last year!You posted this on FB a long time ago

"The humans came back"  It's getting dirty again, right?
I would love to be a person like him! now what he uses to clean the lake

Somebody should finance this project, honestly this is more urgent then the development of a new IPhone, humanity has its funds all in the wrong places

How to contact him would love and honour to help my community to reserve the loss of our Lake too
Wooooah
The birds came back,so did the people too,so they can make it dirty again
Mariano: "I want to help my planet by getting rid of nasty pollutants in our fresh water"  Large companies who have the ability to mass produce: "Let us not introduce ourselves and take your idea inevitable ruining it."
Lways
If I was Marino, I'd patent it and sell it. I'd assess its worth at $20 million and honestly, that might be low.
Good he did'nt say THE WHOLE WORLD cause if the whole world was SOOO clean that it had no germs the planet earth only would die germs are good but not a
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WITH GLASSES WILL SAVE YOUR BUTS

Find the world's smartest man/woman
Who do we pass these wonderful tidbits to?. Fast track please. Let's get behind this.
Thank you 🙏❤ marino for giving us this beautiful gift☺☺☺
God level
Wouldn’t it be insane, if like in maybe like Italy, there’s like a big mountain yeah, and maybe like it was like all independent and that, that also kinda had Marino in its name
I'm sorry, but did I just hear Mario? 😕
That Guy IS incredible!
Ummm isn’t this clips from great big story’s documentation in this? I don’t see any credits given to them. I may be blind but can you please credit them if you have not done so?

Human mind is beyond limitations and this guy is an example 😀...
Can he also make indian lakes clean
Wowww 😍🙏 my country needs this rn
When you said "The birds came back" I smiled. When you said "And the people came back too" I frowned.
He made a mixture/solution which is also like a solution to solving the problem  Do you get it?
I <3 Marino. Thank you brother 🙏🏼
I wanna know more about it
The part when he said "Marino" I remembered the show Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir, Episode Party Crasher in which Marinette became Marino to enter Adrien's party in his home and the part when she said Marino is exactly the same. 😀
Fun Fact : Marino wants now to clean the biggest lake in Peru (Titicaca or whatever it's called) using the same process , but with a larger team.
The shorts feature ruined his videos
That lake is so dirty I first thought he made his own lake till you said the cleaning water. It's so green I thought it was grass
We need this in Danube
His videos makes me love humanity I wish he was my teacher
Can I invite this Man to India pleaasee
Come to India marino 😭😭
Where are you from
Try to find a attack on titan addictive
i hope every one will like marino
If you can clean dirty water and eat it, can I clean my stomach?
Indians have to see it
Sadly  in the current situation of the world and politics it never gonna happen   Cause in the society  organic means no profit  But ot its chemical  Fuck them they will say yeah Lets do it. 🤬
Who notices the merch bar of life go up ❤❤🤔😱
Yes take it to the Philippines. Take it to Florida! Washington state, the beaches are disgusting.
Wait didn't mark Rober make this
Now lets do the sea next
What are the ingredients to the solution?
come to the north pole
Ok I need to do this but I'm a kid  So idk how I do it
Oh no... When he said "....and the people did too" all my enthusiasm vanished. The people will take the lake back to its former state. That's what people do. Destroy.
Oh yeah I’m all for making our water source is clear especially our oceans lakes ponds rivers and all natural bodies of water as well but oceans our top priority
How mutch is the price of it?
Is this product commercially available?
We need more videos to eradicate the tiktok cancer from spreading into YouTube
Respect Marino. Making the world a better place
Marino is a Hero ! Palms for him 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The marino name look so familiar in pilipino
I need more positive content like this in my life
*After the the video* "You can buy this *Super duper friendly solution* only in Peru ! 10% discount, 90$ each bottle !"
Everybody say we need more good people but nobody says we need to become good people
1 minute was worth 😀
Alr, i think im addicted to your videos.
Can you a video on Larry page and Sergey Brin
Can he make malaysia water  be clean
Weetbix
The people came back that didn't do anything to help. I hope this guy got something in return for such a heroic act upon nature.
I thought the lake was a landscape of grass and hills at first. Holy crap that was a hell of a transformation
Amazing!!! 👏
Wow
Ingredients??
This guy's videos are soooo amazing
What's the solution ?? ..... Can we see the whole video @Nas ??

Oysters: *hold my water*    But kudos to that guy.

We really need more scientist like him who dreams of betterment not money.
tbh i thought this was one of those fake cringey channels but the shorts are pretty neat
The government: ill pretend I never saw that
Is it just me or did the water look like like grass   PS: read my comment twice
Can we just appreciate that he is spending so much time to make a video but all we do is just and watch the video we need to do some thing like the people come in his videos
What if you put that into the ocean
Thats it im moving to peru
That’s what I want to do too I hate to see that we are not taking care of our environment it’s like not taking care of your kid of family same thing I want to do something  big like Marco
Good job marino
And why isn’t this on the news he should be on the news
Love your content brother..god bless you ..we not only need people like marino but also people like you who motivates us...thank you

We need more people like Marino. But we need the ingredient too. Is it oat?
Good job, now go take a well deserved nap
I thought that lake was grass land
Finally someone who is telling us other side of the world and not plp like icyol, joshil,blonde boys, booby more facts.
Fun fact:  Marino means marine in both Spanish and Portuguese making him simply do something to what his name represents
We need this in EVERY country!!
Videos like these make me feel better about what’s happening in the world
2 different lake pictures
Wait moreno have a cleaning solution
How about we give more credit, to the guy that just invented the cure to clean  lakes , and it's all organic the eco system  came back . Anyone saw that. ..
I wish people would care more for our earth 🌎 #keepouroceansclean
First when I saw your vid I was like oof another person who makes vids that not makes sense but when I saw more vids then I was so sorry coz this is not stupid stuff this are knowledge facts I showed my mom and she is a fan too!

People around the Great Lakes: Take notes guys!
From the river to the sea
Really good
I’m gonna go dislike all ur vids
What about the fish 🐟
His name sounds like "marine", and is the female version of Marina which is the name of a goddess or something (can't remember but it has to do with the ocean). Also, this man is a lifesaver. He saved an entire lake. What a genius!
We need to put this in the whole ocean🤣🤣🤣👍🏽
I've seen this over a million times. I have never seen new content from this channel in so long
Fun fact: he just made a space for humans to dump their plastic and other trash in
Bro this man is making me feel better about humanity
Why does this make me want to eat it
hey do mongolia plz
We don't need more people like Marino, we need to be more like Marino
Wow you makes very good videos and you research very well we all have to appreciate this man! 😃😀
San Marino
But how about littering and pollution? Btw love your videos!!! Your amazing!!!
What was the solution?
Ironic name.
Ik this is supposed to be inspirational and it is but how do I get this stuff and can I use it to clean a salt water pool?
That’s 1 hour se you tomorrow lol 😂
Ganges River: hold my beer
Yes we need more people like Marino to clean dirty lakes caz we only make them dirty 🙄 .
I'm kinda wondering what type of solution does he use I want to try that too😂
Love your videos just subscribed best educational videos 😀
Sheeesh if only humans were this easy to clean . Therapy wouldn’t have to be expensive
Mark rover made a purifier video
I'm Peruvian and watching this I'm just like well our ancient ancestors turned a 2% agriculturally viable land mass and made it about 50% agriculturally viable and now we make edible and eco friendly fresh water cleaning material that 100% organic POG
I wonder what the solution contains🥺
Yeah send that over here to Hudson River in New Jersey
Burrito cleaned a whole lake?
Wher solution?
You mean bluer 😂
If it can clean lakes can it clean dirty minds? (Guess what I edited)
Manila Bay and Pasig River in Philippines needed this
Marino: *eats his solution* His mind: *gets drunk*
And then the government assassinates him later…..
and government paid it for he job 😂

Only shorts which make some sense 👍
Impressive
I take the organic thing and "Eat it"  ~Clean~✨
You know why there is a will to learn not like govt of each country
I appreciate nas for making these videos
YouTube FINALLY understood what I want from YouTube shorts.
❤️❤️👏👏
I didnt have faith in humanity until these videos
I call bs on this.
Me: why do I think he is gonna eat it?  Him: eats it  Me: I KNOW WHEN SOMETHING GONNA HAPPEND YESSSS
Ooo a lunch
At the start of this video, i was like "so what, this isn't new. Probably some other dangerous solution". But the second he ate it, *gasps* . Very interesting...
TF I never seen any body eat pool cleaner no matter what it’s made with
These vids are so good they make me cry
His name is also similar to marine❤️
Nature's hero💞👏👌💪
BeCaUsE iS oNe HuNdReD % OrGaNiC🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Indonesia liat ini kayaknya bagus
Can you give this product to our country India cause the seas and rivers are so dirty here
What does it attract specifically? Would scrap metals and plastic still be left? Is it like, only organic stuff being pick up?
When the vid actually last 1 min: *ive waited 4...NO! 5000 YEARS FOR THIS!*
Wow
we need to start taking care of Earth the way it takes care of us. i am NOT a nature nerd but our planet truly is one of a kind & we take it for granted. this was nice.
Before the lake was cleaned it looked like land
Your work is so good 👍
The way you pronounced Perú perfectly makes me love you ten times more.
Round of applause 🌸🌸🌸
His name is  Marino and the thing that he clean with has the same name as the cleaning thing.
H u m a n i t y  R e s t o r e d
Its not related but I remember Marinette 😂
if the government spent more money on developing more of these than perpetually fixing things that aren't broken, the world would be a better place
Im peruvian
Your so cool hope you get 3M Subscribers
This is the kind of videos we need on youtube shorts not like those cringy shit  .                --me
1 lake more like 2 billion lakes
My name is Mariel am I Like him :D?
Vegans 100% agree to this
Everybody want to clean their lakes specially in philippines but how to buy his solution??
I WUV DEEZ VIDEOS
I just keep thinking we can eat it 🤔
The birds came back and people came back to recontaminate it 🤣
People that restored faith in humanity😪❤🌈
Why just the lakes and not the oceans???
not like Mark Rober's friend did, this thing makes dust and dirt go up not down. It is a reverse version.
Thank you, Marino!💕😍🌎
Puts solution into Detroit River bursts into flames
This dadd- I mean scientist is hot🥴
Congrats
These videos are just heartwarming and the guy's voice is also really good
Mark rober made a video about this
Lol i have watched marino video like years ago and always thinks he did it in Japan. Didn't realize he is a peruvian scientist.
Y don’t Indian use this to clean Ganga river 🙄
"and people did too"  well say good bye to your clean lake in 2 months
Ah. My daily dose of ✨hope✨
He cleaned water and his name is Marino...  Hmm... Btw, my name is also *MARINhO*
This man should get a noble peace prize
I really want his guy to be send to the ganges river which is not a lake but still i really needed him
And save the axolotl’s
we need to be like marino, not expecting others to do the job for us, and when the water is clean, take care of it, don't go swimming when it's clean when you don't even do shit to help clean it...
"The birds came back" and the polution too. (Sadly)
Damn this is cool
God bless his ideas
Wow
0:49
So what’s the organic stuff
Jesus: I just want to say I'm a huge fan
But how does he make that solution thingy tho ;-;
FOR CHRIST SAKES! *ORGANIC DOES NOT MEAN SAFE!*  IT LITERALLY MEANS IT CONTAINS CARBON! THAT'S IT! GASOLINE IS ORGANIC!
Wow his names Marino it's like he was destined to help save our marine environment.
Can I have a solution of Marino To clean our lake also which is very dirty
I hope the government or mayor gave him a reward bro because this man definitely deserves one. He offered himself to clean the lake, no cost, invented it himself, he legit said  "if no one will do it then I will"  👏 👏
Cause he's Asian.
We need more people like him
My mom has his solution and eats it
That's one min see u tomorrow is so peaceful 🥰❤️
Id hope you can eat it if its made to clean drinking water lol
Why is this guys stuff not flying around the world? Whether he wants to be magnamus, or stupid rich, the world needs this man, the dude rocks.
Imagine eating while cleaning :>>
Where do I buy this????
Indonesian need People like Marino
Stomach acids: you can't defeat me Food: oh I know, he can't either The solution stuff putting all the food at the top of your stomach
Have faith and believe in Jesus Christ and He will save you. I would love to see you in Heaven someday!
Singapore cleaned an entire river.
Marinooo!!!
Hopefully he inspired people
This guy is project nightfall 2. I love it
Wow yes we do
This is very very very good!  How do people invest!!!
Ok his videos are so inspiring 👍😭🤩
That is really cool to see
I wish the whole world do This because look at those other lakes it’s litteraly like dirty as hell
It…. It was actually one minute.. I am speechless
Wonderful... inspiration 👍
reupload but shorter version 1 min
Instead of needing more people like Marino we. Should try to be Marino
For a second that he was gonna say mario
Fun fact, mark rober made a vid about this kind of thing that was made by I believe proctor and gamble 15 ish years ago, if you want to see more content like this, go look at his channel! Also, keep up the great vids!
I want him to be my social studies teacher
I swear he can be a millionaire with his solution heck he could already be one right now
Dr sebi had cure for aids and cancer wheres his credit
Me thinking their was a grass field in the first picture HOLD UP DID HE MAKE THAT BIG OF A MAN MADE LAKE BY HIM SELF
Now I am seeing the world changing
Where can I buy the solution?
Yeah it's good but America thinks that it is a bad Idea
I wonder what it taste like..
Fun Fact: Marino In Spanish Means Water
Clean the gangi
This Marino guy is making the biggest of plays for the environment
I don’t know this guy, but I already know he’s a legendary being.
My life is a mess can he clean that too
Beautiful!😊
Now thats a real man
the man swimming was having a mild seizure
Yea humans ruined 50% of the world
I thought the lake was ground
Don't expect the lake to be clean for much longer since humans came back along with the wild life. We're the source of contamination... 😔
Yo was I the only one that thought he filled up the lake because it really looked like from the top view it’s just some grass dirt and trees
Me after this: I’ll buy your entire stock!!
Ay dawg fan I get some of that solution?  Only a spoonful
Obly og's know this is a re-upload
That’s the type of thing we need to see more about
That should be everywhere
But where can I find his product??
Does this mean we can finally clean the Gulf of Mexico???
Very Ironic name
what is this “solution”?   Very interesting, and hope to hear more !
Bet it'll cost alot to buy some
At this rate he going to find that dead body in my basement 😳
aye guys i think he found a scientist
Mark Rober already made a video about this, but in glad this guy gets attention
There’s only benefiting the boat is taking away all the negative points in the ecosystem in elite
Plot twist: he dyed the lake blue
That’s insane
Why does every video give me dharr Mann energy?
Tietê precisa disso
more more hope
Tag the product please I will dump it on Pasig river.
I can just imagine galactus sprinkling earth with the solution to add a better flavour, like salt... yum
Bruh this guy needs an award asap
We gotta clean water up  Sun: water is suppose dirty!  Earth: no I'm not a person ima planet
Now that i think about it. I think if we clean sea it's a better thing than just cleaning lakes
Love your videos..so informative 👍
Yes sirrrrr
I find it funny how his name is “Marino”
Wow really cool Dude 👌🏻
"...and people did too"  A fcking mistake invite human
The city

I am from Peru
I don’t like science so it’s not for me but that’s cool
Me looking at my piss:       *Interesting*
Honestly it’s videos like these that are so hard to not press the like button 👍
Yes
Marino Morikawa is a genius. Utilizing organic microbubble solution that have an electromagnetic field of positive and negative ions to work like a magnet to pollutants. The micro-nano bubble then act as biofilter, capturing impurities like a sponge.
Bro that guy in the video has the same name as me
Apt that his name is Marino.
I THOUGHT THE DIRTY LALE WAS LAND
I love that his name is Marino and he's a water scientist
That's amazing and good news. Hope word of it spreads to other communities. Thanks Marino.
Uranium is 100% organic
Marino in my language means "sea", will it be a sign?
Wow💯💯❤
Why aren't isnt it produced on mass?
Wehn tf is amazon
Marino in italian is used for things that refer to the ocean or sea or anything.. Un cavalluccio marino=a seahorse
Imagine if we put this on the ocean
Can we appreciate how perfectly did he pronounce Perú?
I love this story
Its cool cuz his name "Marino" also means "of the sea"
Just boil the water! Heat gets rid of bacteria / bad chemicals
Not all heros wear capes
forbbiden cereal
This man gives me faith in humanity
Lake Erie needs this real bad
They should try this in flint, Michigan
This is fantastic!
Just watch the Marmara Sea.
Is it safe for the oshens
Next time he will clean the ocean
I though that the dirty lake was grass-
I, Marino have a dream
This guy is a legend
Can I Get Some more Information About MARINO ? I NEED SOME HELP CLEANING A RESERVOIR #Nasdaily
Dude thats awesome 💯
does it taste good
i still have no faith in hummanity because people said infinite bobux than delete any virus
No! Be more like Marino!
Ugh…this is so fantastic we can save the world but so many refuse to do it
So reuploaded
Dude is god
Fallout 3 could've been a whole lot shorter with this man
Good on Marino for actually doing something instead of just complaining about it!   Someone with money needs to send him to third world countries so he can help them with their water supply!
This is amazing!
Why does the world completely Ignore this stuff that could save and evolve our planet
Thanks Marino
You need to use that solution on the ocean!!!!
Damn why am I only learning about this now
Maybe Georgia the state can use that for the chatahoochi river lol
You just earned a subscribe
Good job Marino keep it ☝
God, his name was meant to be, in spanish marino is marine
すごいです わたしもそんな風な人になりたいです
I’m sorry, I gotta say this, that swimming part looked like you were just jabbing your arms forward lol. Anyway, this is honest to god incredible
Where can I buy this shit
His name fits with the river lol
This is old news but still respect to that guy cleaning the lake
I thought for a moment, that what he ate, was the resulting amalgamation of the polluted water lol
Has anyone else noticed in some of his videos the % on his shirt is going down from video to video
nas stop reposting, something original PLEASE
Felicidades, que NUNCA venga a México nwn
:Mark robber lol he's like morgz coping me
Ok so who wants to bet that this can turn into a company
HIS "SOLUTION" ? 😳😳😳
Buuuut what exactly do they do with all the contamination that floats to the top of the lake...?
So you are telling me that before Marino we couldn't clean dirty water? 😱😱😱😱
With Marino's solution for dirty waters and the technique that Singapore uses to retire trash would make this planet a better place.
God this man went full Phineas and Ferb
And where can we get this solution?
Btw cleaning swamps is a bad idea because all the animals there have already adapted, for this one it said that birds returned so I'm gonna assume that this lake was suffering from pollution
How did he make that powder???
Why is everyone saying it’s a repost as if it’s a bad thing?
Daily dose of faith in humanity
what does it taste like though
Omg
Just remember, bill gates told mark rober that this was a waste of money EVEN when giving him burger.
A lot of mushrooms are organic too! Let’s go eat all the wild mushrooms we can find!
Is he Japanese?
That lake is so clean :O
The world will never be 100 clean because of ppl that live in it 😞
wow so cool marino is such a good scientist
I think he is using a comment filter but he already made this video
This guy deserves a Nobel Prize!
I like him
YOU ALREADY POSTED THIS
37% life
love this!!
Where can I get some of this stuff I want to help him out
His name suits him perfectly
That man swam like a kat
Just because something is organic doesn't mean you can eat it
Take care for our own world ❤️🌍
The inventor of that solution needs a Grammy
Wow
:D
Bro not just lakes THE WORLD 😃
Ok but what's his solution tho
Wow 🥺 cool👍
Legend 😎😎
Yes we do need more people like Marino
And he ate it all
This person that helped made that thing he just eat,I need him make me food that can make me smart next, honestly I wish more scientists was like him
Bro, stop reuploading videos. To this point, it's so annoying. I love your videos when they are on a new topic so please make new content. 🙂
So how do I buy this?
Don't let Nestle find this too late run
海に有効かはわからないけど、東京湾に使って欲しいな
Give him more recognition. Well done.
POV: *you want to eat marino's solution*
But that in lake Erie
Time to save Africa
ngl this was pretty inspiring
I tought his name was mario
How can i get in touch with him?
he is the fucking chosen one, in my language (italian) "Marino" has something to do with the sea lmao
I love how the name of the guy in Perú is marino which in english is marine
Yes..he turned the lake so good the background had buildings appear randomly :0
Can I just say that his name is so cool
But the fish need some of the bacteria
We need this stuff
The fact that his name is the same as my surname makes it 100 times better, I feel important
‘Marino’ huh, fitting
When I grow up I want to be a scientist because it's so interesting and also I will travel around the world to look for driy lakes to clean them
Yes we need people like the amazing Marino ❤ and we concurrently need less of those environmental dickwards who cause the devastating pollution of our beautiful planet.
That’s truly… Amazing!
This is the type of YouTube shorts we want not cringe and fake ones
CNN 10 material
Hello my name is NINOOOO
We need marino the scientist to teach students, teachers, professors, how to make the formula SO he can make the world a better place 😁😁😁❤❤❤
A real Hero
Where can I buy this we have the dirtiest pond in our neighborhood
We need more of his solution lol
But my name is Marino ;-;
Youtuber 1: i post 2 video’s a week Youtuber 2: well i post 3 video’s a week Nas Daily: amateurs.
Hey india.
I thought it was land and then he added water.
I love how he says Peru for some reason
His names tells all
Wouldn’t that screw up some ecosystems too? Like fish that are used to dirty water
We need that in my pool it's so dirty so I have to empty it everyday and scrub
Does this mean we can clean the lake that has all the trash in Singapore
I lowkey thought that lake was a field
I’m from Peru Lima and I’m surprised you know what Peru is
That's a lake i taught it was joust land
Not a little bit a lot cleaner
Legend
Marino in our language means killer
Reminds me of Singapore trash situation
I found a scientist in Peru who turned THE FRIGGIN FROGS GAY
This is old how have we not progressed
I think the places that need it right now is Flint Michigan China and the Middle East
Dont say: We  need people like Marino Say: I will be like marino
This channel just gives us so much hope
Jesus loves you
This reminds me of when your parents say you better clean this room so good I better be able to eat of it
I remember seeing something like this on mark robers channel but all the dirt goes to the bottom instead
I did a project in middle school on Peru. I was kind of bummed out cause I wanted to do it on Italy since I'm Italian but now that I'm older, I'm glad I did it on Peru. People here in America need to hear about this place more often. It's a really wonderful country with wonderful people.
Yo we all need to come together and get this guy stuff out there
If I had the money.I would invest in his product.
Do the ocean next
100 percent organic huh?   Poop fertilizers are too
Great invention. What is it?
He said that's one minute  In 58 seconds

i thank the lord for these people, man.
Does anyone know how to get in touch with this guy and where to buy the product?  Thanks
Wow Nice!
Wow that's awesome god bless his soul. Thanks again for the great video loveybug xoxoxo
