Big Baller Liv😂😂😂

Building Algérie Bridges france 🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅🚄🚅
It was so much your shoes cost like $11,000😮
Unbelievably gorgeous!  Its unreal
Wait, you have shoes
Liv literally brought me back to watching wrestling what a dope talent fr
that's my girl
Shane McMahon is the WWE sneaker goat … don’t ever disrespect Shane like this again … he started it all
WWE are so much better guest than Rappers, they got personality. Rappers are so boring
Probably the only episode I've watched where I'd wear everything she bought. Lady has good taste.
11k🙂 bro....
Your a champion in the ring  And champion with the shoes 👟
Music? Please 10:30.
Shane started the sneaker shyt in wwe…but it was called wwf then
Showing off that money
👏👏🌹🌹💫💫💕💕
I just watch this for the intro up till the title card!😊
Chat we have officially  spent 11000 dollars on shoes
My boo thang Liv Morgan Mysterio🐰💕
Watch meeee
The game has changed, all these sneakers are about to have the price now
I love Liv Morgan
Love you so much and I wish I could see you  ❤❤❤
all of these shoes are marked up like 9000%, insane
4:19 u are my bestie girl
Some Chinese kid earned $4 making livs $11,500 worth of Nikes
She spent the most out of anyone so far apparently.😮
That lady at the cash register really looks like she doesn't like Liv 😂😂
I got my shoes for like 60 bucks
Not Liv just casually spending $11k 😭
almost $700 for Nike's bro. no way thats gotta be a scam😭😭😭😭
1️⃣🦘⭐️💯
Liv Morgan got that long bread 🍞 💰
She was already my favorite, this just moved her into goat status LOL
New jersey in the house! Everyone loved garden state plaza until u work there lol
She is buying the whole store
2200.00 for some non-game worn shoes is wild..
Krass. Ich dachte, sie sucht nur ein Paar Schuhe....😮. 👌👍
1:09 wait what
I don’t really know anything about her but I saw a body cam video of her getting arrested on some bs earlier today and the way she handled it made me a fan
The most relatable situation saying "now for gifts" then finding three more things for yourself lol. Love her. Honestly never owned a pair of Jordans, I support my household and my mom house so I just get whatever is cheap but honestly always thought they look fire, maybe one day.
Gio Ninja chips 🥷🏽🥷🏽🥷🏽  Power 🏀🏈🎮⚾🎮⚾🎮⚾  R5
Liv Morgan's my favorite women's world champion
Being the champ has got its perks
Liv balled out
11k on shoes lol
Girl you slayyyyyyyyyyy like girl I wanna be you best friend I will protect you even tho I am just nine
Hello beautiful
$2,900 for a shoes.
The cashier I take it she's not a Liv Morgan fan😂
How did she choose without any hesitation ? Or thinking? Maybe she did but they cut it off so the video wouldn’t be too long but if she didn’t I’m impressed
I don't like Joe La Puma 😕 😐
Is it sponsored or its her own money?
with this bidens inflation all i can afford is walmarts and one  kicks and once a year probably, 11k on shoes thats wild
Liv is easily the hottest wrestler ever
I watch roman Reigns 😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

My cutie wrestler 😍 love you liv
This series really do be just celebs flexing that they spend $10k on shoes in a day...
11. Grand on shoes made in China for like 10 bucks a piece
The person that thought of this show to sell their sneakers for thousands of dollars every celebrity is a genius. Almost like you don't even need regular people to shop at your store. The profit margin is huge
リブたんかわいい
Great taste!!
11k on sneakers is crazy that’s some peoples years rent 😂
Luv her.  ❤
I aint gon lie de la pumas kick game is true garbage
I Loved Oreo 4.Air Jordan Oreo 4.

Liv Morgan is one of my favorite wrestlers 1.Lita 2.Becky lynch 3.Morgan
I have to play it at 0.25 speed to read the receipt :(
Liv could come out on tv without any make up on and still be one of the most beautiful women in the world!

The champ of sneaker spending. The most I've seen on here so far, and lots of gifts. Nice.
If the shoes are real in that store then I gotta go there
Best episode hands down 💯
How much?
11 grand 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
World's greatest championship and God's cutest angel
She’s bad
Hi Liv and God Bless you
Yeah. Not after that 11k she just dropped.
❄️👑💠
Liv is amazing!
11,000 has to be a new record!! But she also has great style and taste in sneakers.
3000k for mochas is tough
30mph over the limit cuts 10 minutes off my 30 minute drive
Thats when u know money aint an issue when they tell you your total is 11,570 16 cents an your reaction is thank you an u hand them your card lol
Those prices are highway robbery!
Liv is so cute
Nah let’s be honest Liv didn’t rlly care abt spending 11k😅
Bro needs to shave off that 5 o clock shadow. Doesnt suit him at all.
It annoys me so much when people don't bend their trainers.  Why you wearing a sports shoe then restricting range of movement?
Love the air Jordan’s she picked didn’t get the chance to have them growing up because we didn’t have much money growing up but as I’ve gotten older and started working I can now have a pair or 2
If Johnny Sins was the shopkeeper
That cashier was def a souless npc 😂
Liv Morgan looks so cute 😍 💕 💗
Iluvliv
I wish I met Liv Morgan now maybe I could’ve gotten a pair of Travis Scott Jordan 1 lows from her
AJ Lee did it before, Cena did it before, Shane McMahon did it before. The Killer Bees did it first.
Finally someone who out bought the Young Bucks! Everyone was like below 2k, Young Bucks each did almost 5k each if divided by 2. Liv out bought them Combined!
shes the best
They just draw a shoe and the sweatshops get to work...these people aren't that creative.
She's very kind,  down to earth and great personality.  She's insanely gorgeous
She is just so very amazingly gorgeous
11k 😮
11 grand 😅 Ben Affleck, Chris Tucker and Matt Damon bought shoes togther and it cost 3grand change man. Wow 😳
9 lakhs…! Okea
I love her❤❤😢😢 k
I love liv cant believe i didnt know she was on an episode.
11k on kicks
Compared to other sports celebrities, wrestlers make the show better because they can talk.
Wow she brought so many shoes
The guy should make a video with John Cena, a out his sneakers and buy ones
11 grand on sneakers? I guess they closed early that day
I wished I met and dated Liv Morgan since we’re a year and a single day apart!! ❤️❤️❤️
She would make a great Harley Quinn 😂
Those girls didn't like each other checking out at the end lol..
I luv her ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
i love liv my fav on wwe
11k on sneakers is overkill me but not fir my girl Liv. She's a baller.😂

Why these shoes so expensive
Gionna jene Daddio Liv Morgan yaonlylivvonec WWE 💞💞💞💞💞😍😍😍🤩🤩😍🥰😍😍
Love Liv. Just wish I could’ve told not to go to Stadium Goods. They’re way over priced. Yes obviously she has the money for it but still, they should be checked on their prices.
She so hot and pretty just being herself. I would marry her instantly. But ofc ill never will
she never got them red jordon 1s
Liv Morgaaaaan!!!! the cutest <3

Sneaker shopping with Meg Griffin.
🗑️ Wrestler
11K is wild, she definitely getting that Vince McMahon money😭💯
Avec tout les gens qui ont du mal à finir leur fin de moi au etas unis .
Biggest con on YouTube. Get famous person to shop at your store, spend thousands on shoes they don’t need and get free publicity… 😂😅
Holy that was a bag!!! She deserves it!!! Great episode!!
Liv can you buy me sneakers I am your huge fan. I like Jordan 1 the gray and black and green and black. Lol! The Champ hugs

Dope choices… big fan of hers…
Would be nice, just go out spend 11k on Trainers
her shoe game is fireee
She cute
The she champ is here 🔥 dropping 11k like a boss and her Day 1 match was solid against Becky
Americans have one style when it comes to sneakers… Jordan’s this and Jordan’s that

0:57 stop the cap Liv
Crease🤢🤮

Top 3 annoying laugh I've ever heard
I love liv Morgan 😍👌
Dropping 11ks on sneakers wow
Spent a bag 😮‍💨
She so fine, good lord. Finna start watching Wwe again.😂
The Killer B's was the first wrestlers wearing sneakers in the ring they wore the yellow and black Nike dunks
0:25 why is her tongue yellow......?
Just be  putting any prices on these shoes.
How much?  Cost of living crisis.  Don’t need to see the rich and famous dropping a house deposit on plastic sneaks made by people making 20 pence a week
Overrated champion at that, I'm out ✌
she is the Best and biggest  customer from wwe.
I've got plenty of other sneakers
I'll be wearing Nike maybe
Hi liv you might see me in sneakers when I come to see your matches okay
I would never go with an extra low shoe. At least an air max level height at the least. That's just me.
The only reason i tune in to wwe these days is because of liv i'm madly in love with her
These shoes seem over priced
Straight robbed.
Liv has become an inspiration to me and I will always wear sneakers.  I have never liked sandals (yeah, Liv, they are too girly) and I have owned Converse Chuck Taylor high tops, Converse Attack high tops, Converse low tops, New Balance, Reebok, Nike, Pony, just to name a few
ultra flex ! nice pickups ! <3
🧨💥👻🌟🦄
why did i think that was corina kopf 🤣🤣
11.500 dollars !
Just casually drops $11k on shoes 🤣😭💀
i Love Liv!!!
Liv 😍😍😍
WWE SHOP STORE LOS ANGELES AND HOLLYWOOD, HOW LONG WE ALL GOING TO WASTE TIME.... AMOEBA HAVE LOTS OF Collections.... TO SELL!
women want everything we got lol
$11k on shoes wow
"I might of not been the first sneaker head in WWE but I think I might be the Best" 🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
overpriced, no way she paid 2900 for those travis, they are 1080 at stockx and sail is 1540 ...
Is being a WWE wrestler nowadays makes that much money? As far as i know back then being a WWE wrestler didn't or am i mistaken all this time.😅  I love her vibe she kinda reminds me of Trish Stratus. 😄
Seriously how can you not like her, she’s cool asf, I’ve met her in person once and she was so chill and humble ❤🔥
I like how Liv Always has the perfect outfits and she’s a cool girl to talk too you know she’s someone you wanna hang around with and have fun with and talk to she’s probably the nicest wwe superstar ever ik the others are nice in person too but Liv has an awesome personality and you know she’s just a chill person Liv is probably my favourite out of the woman’s devision.
John Cena was the original person that started that with the Jordans and we’re just gonna type of shoes in general I need to go back and look at John Cena shoe collection brain John Cena on
She is a kind of real Harley Quinn for me❤️❤️❤️🥰
She's cute but I have no idea who this is.
Uglier shoe she got where the Travis. They look like they been beat up and left to dry in the desert lol. People dropping big bucks over a name. "Dang your got the Travis"!! And that's it? 🤦
I prefer New Balance 608 or the black Skechers
5:01 7:27 Air Morgan’s
Wow she's like the most beautiful girl
She just went 🦧 💩💪🏽💯🔥
I would wear the air Jordans.
No roman reigns is the best sneaker head in the whole WWE.
0:26 , 10:22 ^ I was at Friday Night Smack Down & she was one of the reasons the show was lit❕♥️
She gonna turn some of them into wrestling shoes
Love her , so sweet, so down to earth, Love ya Luv, love from Jersey ❤️
She legit seems so fun to hang with.
She is cute, cool and has good taste in kicks 😍
Hey Liv you have pretty eyes ❤❤🥰👍🥰❤️🥰😊
$11k 😮
bo dallas is a lucky lucky man
If I could afford those sneaker stores from this channel I would be like a kid in a candy store.
Just pay attention to the guest appearance reactions they are genuine it's like the guy interviewing knows more than he should idk if this is good or not but as long as the information isnt like interrogated.
That much for grade school???
She took them back
Her laugh 😍
this is a long shot, but I'm curious what kind of answers I'd get. whats a great wide width shoe that isnt too plain jane?
Smoking hot and I like her drip !
The Air Jordan 4 Lightning are great... good choice.
Solid pickups she dropped a bag as well
👍👍👍
For the record, Shane started it all.
Shane McMahon started the trend even before Cena. Shane o Mac was wearing 1’s and 4’s since like 99
Hey Liv How you doing Girl ❤❤❤❤😘😘😘🥰🥰
Liv's outfit here is so beautiful 🙂
Before Newport Centre Was Around Here in Jersey City, My Family Would Always Go to Either Garden State Plaza or Menlo Park for Most of Our Holiday Shopping
I can’t find the Jordan 1 retros anywhere 😔
Its funny to me how she talks about the Jordan 1s being great athletic shoes when we all know they are absolute trash to hoop in.
woman !!! 😍
What a beautiful, sweet and great woman Liv is❤
See you in 2025 wwe
So Mark Cuban spend $600.00 and gets free gift shoes. This girl did 11k and gets a thank you. Girl got ripped off
Bro it’s like they raised the price on some of those shoes cause she was coming in. You can get those Travis for 2 grand cheaper. Whack!
I was expecting her to buy 2 pairs max - but she shopped like a CHAMP - pun intended
I like the White and Red Jordan's the best. Classic shoe, imo
11 grand for shows that cost 5 dollars or less to make. What a joke. Rip off. I would never waste money on shoes like that.
Bros holding back
The correct word is TRAINERS!
Yall hyped bout her but literally her shoe collection was started by her ex Enzo amore
She doesn't realize how beautiful she is
$12,000 ON FKN SNEAKERS .. GTFOH
She spent alot of money and she has great taste. 🔥
Do I just google stadium good for the address in NY?
My crush bruh and I don't even watch wrestling 🤫🥰♥️
Liv Morgan is adorable and a good worker in the ring
Hi liv pls reply bc ever time I play wwe on tv with my little brother I always pick you
She only wore sneakers cause of her ex Enzo 😂
Mankind started sneakers in wwe
Air Forces (black forces during special stipulation matches lol) AJ1s AJ4s AJ6s AJ7s AJ11s Nike Dunks Air Max 1s
My favorite episode with Liv Morgan ❤️👑😘
You are my love Liv morgan
Like a Smokin Hot mix of Billie Eilish & Harley Quinn! I'm 😍!!! She's the Champ alright
She looks good out of wrestling gear 😘
I'm also baffled by her spending 11k for sneakers, but I think either some of them are gifts for doing this gig or some of them are paid by WWE advertisement department. WWE wrestlers make millions of dollars from contract, merchandise and other but they also spend crazy amount in expenses such as traveling, food and health insurance. They're also very careful with how they spend their money if you hear their stories so idk if she paid 11k out of her own pocket!!
Liv🥵🔥
ผมรักแม่มากๆครับผมคิดถึงมากๆครับ
$2900 for Reverse Mochas?! Legit robbery
She dropped a bag
she look like a superhero!!!
eww
Yeah Liv Morgan cute
nahhh, bryson tiller paid 27k 😂 he’s the best
nahhh, bryson tiller paid 27k 😂 he’s the best

Wow...... $11k for some shoes!!! At least she's got some serious taste in sneakers
Proverbs 13:13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
The Retro 1's always a go to.
She looks like Margot Robbie!
Shes pretty asf 👌🏽
If you pause it at 3:35 top roll 5th rainbow dye snickers. I want that pear.
She didn't look happy to purchase 11g of shoes. She's definitely wasn't expecting that...
🥰

Liv really a Sneakerhead!
SHANE O'MAC WILL ALWAYS USE HIS AJ1 WHEN HE WRESTLE, HE STARTED THE TREND...MONEY...MONEY...MONEY...👍👍👍
Did they really have to show the prices of everything at the end come on now we all know she's rich 🤣
Liz thighs are thicc

Wow Liv i am fan but you overpaid for every one on those kicks just because it was at concepts that taxed you Hard.... shame on you
You rock Liv Morgan! I think you would nice in all black Nike Air Force 1's. 🥰🥰
Shane McMahon said ouch to $800 ? He is pretty cheap, usually shops at Walmart ?
DROOLING..........She's BANGIN.
Lita was great. She had a style that blended well with the Hardys. I wish Liv continued success, she's all that & then some.
Neymar is still the highest spender
The Champ is Here 🙌🏻🥵
Invite John Cena!!!!!
Rhipy Rhpy   love ❤️💕💕💕

Liv Morgan So Nice ❤
Can you do Carmella next?
Nahhhh she dropped a BAG LOL woooo
She mad beautiful!!!
Yo, so when y'all have the WWE woman's champion spending over 11 thousand in your business. Can y'all find a cashier that doesn't look annoyed to be there? She might has well of throw the sneakers in her face. Such disrespect.  Long Liv the Queen
shout out to GSP. the best mall in new jersey
Love is awesome !!!
11 grand😳
Riot Squad.
Sheeeesh champ cashed out
I’ve finally found my future wife
Hey Liv bringing back that blue Tongue Sun! Liv u gotta be fresh to death from the bottom to the top u should of work red shorts.
Do they try the sneakers? See if they are comfy or fit well? Before paying?
Liv got that new champ check
Liv morgan favorite superstar
She’s definitely right about the gender thing about sneakers. I have a cousin who grew up as a tomboy as well, till this day she still wears Jordans. I remember she had those PlayStation Nikes when she was in high school many years ago.
I just love her personality telling about the her story being a tomboy and her favorite wrestlers John cena and her inspiration lita was so cool I just love liv morgan don't forget to watch her on smackdown I love you liv morgan I wish your sister a happy birthday and I hope you keep your championship! Thank you complex for guest starring liv morgan!
I want the intro beat
That's crazy, why would you wrestle in a pair of shoes you waited hours in line for the very next day?!? I would at least give it a few months before using them in that sort of situation. But those boot/sneakers were amazing.
Pretty humble. She must've said "thank you" at least 15,000 times.
Shane McMahon was the first i think to wear sneakers
Liv coo
Liv is like me if I went in there and had the Bills she’s got. I want all of them.
My goodness, She is very good looking 🫡
Her laugh ain't it💀
Her face when cashier tells her total is $11,000.00 is priceless... these shoes are absurdly overpriced.
She definitely got Robb on those prices 😂
My girl liv is ballin
😍
Her arm healed pretty fast
She didnt even flinch when she heard the price
Love Liv! She's such a cool person. But I'm not into the trainers (as we call them) thing in that I couldn't spend hundreds on a pair. And if you scuff them that's it? People pay lots to wear once? Nah. I've got 2 pairs of trainers (one blue Adidas and one black and white Nike) and they were 30 quid each and I'll wear them for years.
Liv Morgan es my sister Favitewwe stare
LIV MORGAN IS THE REALIEST WITH THE KICK GAME IN THE WWE.. SHE CAME THRU STADIUM GOODS AND DROPPED A MAJORRRR BAGGG ON THE KICKS AND EVERY SINGLE PAIR SHE COPPED IS 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Travis Scott lows and those low bulls. TRASH. But everything else. Proper.

The fickle WWE crowd started to boo her, what a shame. She's awesome. A few weeks ago she was cheered af. As I said, the WWE crowd is a fickle bunch.
Shane McMahon founded the sneakers in the ring thing! End of debate
ya'll just scammed her
She has 🔥 taste in shoes..and those to the knee Jordan ones..crazy 🔥🔥🔥💯
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Bro....she spent $11,570.16 ON SHOES!!!!  That's my rent for an entire year. I absolutely love Gionna. But this is crazy. But as somebody else in the comments section said, she deserves all the good that she is getting. But as somebody else in the comment section said, she deserves all the good that she is getting.

That haul 🔥🔥🔥
That wrestling Money 💰
Man Liv only makes 250k a year . Wrestlers dnt make that much....and she spent 11k??? That's like 7 percent of her yearly salary. Be careful Liv. They may axe u nxt yr.
She got ripped off
11:17 this is a Bred toe in the final showing of all the shoes, but Liv bought the Chicago colorway

Yeah champ.
She’s so pretty 😍
My girl! 😍

She not a real sneaker head stop lieing only jordan 1s I've see her in is the ones she got on 4 this episode 💀 she don't know about sbs
I hope they dont do her wrong like nikki ash. That Summerslam match was no bueno. They need to show shes competitive instead of winning by luck
who?
Bruh she bought the store
She picked a pair of bred toe lows in the end and was billed for chicago bulls lows instead😉
She have a really great personality I think she will do well in twitch streams and stuff
Liv I'm going to get some unique ones when I go
She fine af 😍  and had style
thanks JLP and Complex for listening to the comments and bringing people on the show that can speak, answer questions and can work with JLP.
She got that moneyyy. Actually proud of LIV she deserves it
THEY STAY ROBBING PEOPLE ON THIS SHOW !
Respect to Liv she got straight HEAT!!!

this place hella over charges for the shoes...they pretty much doubled the price that almost all other resell stores charge...Liv got ripped off
Hi liv
I need to became a wrestler so I can but alot of dr martes boots 🤣
I am curious what the tie dye looking nike is it looks nice it looks like an air force 1 but I have never seen this color combination before.
😍😍😍
Dang so she forgot Shane McMahon has been wrestling in sneakers since she was a kid, that’s messed up
Liv is lowkey baddie😏😍
I'll shoot myself if I ever even spend half that on shoes  Because I've obviously become part of the problem
been waiting on live to become champ. I was not expecting this, but you can tell she watches this a lot. Liv you just had the best sneaker head on Complex too.
thats cracy 11k bro i would settle for some pumas way cheper and best quality
She went crazyyyyy…respect 💪🏽
You only liv once and she’s definitely enjoying being champion and stuff like this that’s totally relatable in context. She’s defining what a champion should be not letting the championship define her
Smart lady pick a good hobby.
im asumming is realy expensive der
Can we get Bianca Bel Air on here tho?
Liv bella y talentosa!
Awesome
Low key  thought it was corrina kopf when I first saw the picture
she soo fine, is fun, cool, nice, pretty, laugh isnt annoying and has personality.... next to maryse i swear she the hottest finest sexiest WWE woman performer
Between her and Alexa 😍😍 she’s really developed over the years. Well deserved on the title
11k?! wow.. she spent more than billie did in her video.
I remember Shane Mcmahon wrestling in BC3s and TB3s back in the early 2000s. I give him props for starting the wrestling in fly sneakers trend.
she's wearing the fusion red 1's , so many people hate on these for no reason they are hella nice and she's even more likeable with them on.
Idk who she is, but she 🔥
People’s champ.
Riphy Rhipy 🎉🎉🎉🎉🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Every shoe so overpriced. Travis 1 3000$....you can get it for half price😆
Dope chick✨🤙🏼

ENZO AMORE HAD REAL KICK GAME 🔥 BUT SHANE MCMAHON WAS THE 🐐 GOAT

Sneaker shopping with Jakob Ingebrigtsen 😎🇳🇴🥇
Is wwe real though or fake
W episode!!
Shane o mac definitely started the sneaker trend in the ring!
My favorite wrestler ❤️ she can pin me anytime
@complex when will you invite Edge? He's also a Jordan guy.
WE WANT JORJA SMITH
Ahhh, don't think we didn't catch that she got the Bread Toe Lows and the Twists, BUT the pictures on the receipt were a Jordan 1 Mid  Split and the Chicago Bulls Low loool
Sneakerheads hating  creases is a direct shot at Nike, etc. using the cheapest, most plasticky, lowest quality, fakest "leathers" possible to build their shoes.
Nice, great price range! 😂👌🏾
Travis Scott's for $2949 @10:49 !!! She got scammed! :D
The way she said "HIS LITTLE PUMPIES" 😂
🔥🔥 pick ups!
Do the guests really pay for all of their shoes or Complex gives some of em for free?
she gives out really good positive vibes 🔥
She's definitely not a pick me🤭
She must be rich rich getting all of them sneakers
Jumping jim bruzel andnb Brian Blair the killer bees started the wrestling sneaker thing
Now this is real Sneaker Shopping!!
I was there at Day 1 too and I didn't know she had shoes on.
Why not a good adidas ? Nike only
This is king of the best dollar spree recently... Others buy one or two... This girl nails it.
liv is simply  🔥
Never heard of her but her energy is amazing 😁 ✨
U guys taxed her on those Travis’
Those are bred toes not bull 1s
Super HUMBLE
Safe to say Shane O Mac started sneakers in the WWE. He's been wearing J'z in the ring
0:38  Yes Liv, "Eee..."
Anyone know of a show like this but for hats?
Awesome Lady
Get the GOAT on here ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC
her personality, looks, and shoe game is top tier
her pickups is solid too 😅🔥🔥

Liv just went crazy on the shoes
They be over price
She just became champion......
The people's champ!
She looks like pornstar Elsa Jean. Thank me later.

Hey hey he6 🔥🔥🔥🙈
John cena for the next one

Hen
Air Morgans 🤩
We love Liv
The Smackdown Women Chaaaaaampiiiiioooon
Keep the Liv Morgan interviews coming!! Love seeing our girl in all these interviews of late!
Brock Lesnar should be on here
Eddie Kingston is selling trainers now?🤔
Joe, you're too important and cool to be on camera with a creased up white tee. Fire the on set stylist and hire me...I GOT YOU! Lol...no, but seriously.
Big ballin
Could've really impacted a lot of homeless people lives with that eleven grand❗ But no, had to let the selfishness take over❗ Could've bought around 50,000 pairs of shoes for homeless people❗ No, just buy 10 pairs that you will wear twice❗
Bro is it just me or does she look like Corinna Kopf
She really went shopping 😍
OverPaid 🤦🏻‍♂️ need to do research before you get finesse on the show 😂
wow she just carried every sneaker shopping guest this season… LETS GO LIVE!!!!! 🤟🏽
man i've always wanted Sasha Banks up here...her sneak game is mean..side note tho Liv is so bad!!!!!!!!
I like that her selections (even though she said some were gifts) were in her lane of taste. She is who she is. No Yeezy, NB, or later model Jordans for her. Respect to the champ.
Bring cbum to buy some sneakers
We need montez ford
I wish you could leave a meme reaction on youtube comments because that price tag had me like 😳😳😳
$2👀0 For A Pair Off White Air Jordan???? Ummmm... No...  Put em Back...  😂🤣
Congrats!! She spent more money than CR7 buying sneakers
Liv is stunning. And she's a solid ring hand. She needs to continue to improve her mic skills and make her move transitions more crisp but she is a good talent who can get better with hard work, hopefully she will step her game up now that she's champ, i wish her luck and much success
Liv is so hot and as for the shoes...no comment because we all know she a sneaker head since riott squad days.
My baby Liv😍😍
11k  on nike sneakers the sneaker market is wild.
Nah fr this one of the best interviews ever, she got that personality and love that she likes to consider what jordans to wear on the big screen. Dope!
If it wasn’t for the wwe belt I thought she would have been an onlyfans girl
Put some respect on Shane McMahon's name
WATCH HER 🖤
Next JLP will have a blind 2 year old that can't talk, on the show...
YOU ONLY LIV ☝️ NICE JOB CHAMP 😍😍😍💪💪💪👍👍👍
i love you liv❤️🫶🏻
She went b😂ig 😂😂👌🏽👌🏽
Liv’s sneaker game is fire
People need to give more credit to Liv when it comes to sneakers cause she has one of the best shoe collections no cap. And it's crazy that she said the oreo 4s are one of her favorites cause I have a pair. 😱
i think i have a crush on her
Wow she doesnt look like a wrestler!! Good episode.
Nah they did her SLIME with those prices, 3K for the reverse Mochas is CRAZY 💀
This girl has to have the greatest marketing team in the world. They deserve a raise for real!
That's the most I've seen somebody spend in a while. Great selection as well.
She got that roid voice.
Somebody tell me if she wasn’t just robbed here !!!!
She’s a hard worker and she deserves everything she has been given this past month. I hope she remains champion until at least royal rumble.
Shout out to Ronda Rousey for letting Liv get the win.
Why all the beats hittin this episode
First one would be John Cena since he wore Adidas high tops and Reebok Pumps in 2003 but the first one who wore Jordan was Shane McMahon then Batista with AJ28.
Love that she’s wearing the light fusion red Jordan’s aka the McDonald’s on her feet. I love and have that pair. Not many people wear it due to the colorway but she rocked those. Nice when someone wears something that not everyone else wears.
The champion balling out today with some awesome choices. Loved the interview and how she was also inspired by Cena for her style.
I love how she goes sneaker shopping after her victory at summerslam
7:37 I'mma come clean Miss Morgan FLY wit some fly BLK & White "custom" sneakers IJS BLK n White is a must have in out fit to sneakers combo Miss Morgan did that 😍😘 Miss Morgan
11k well she is rich after all getting wwe money <3
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.   (Philippians 2:13) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
Whoever dresses her does an amazing job.
Woah 2900 on a reverse travis scott low, thats a 1500usd max shoe in the aftermarket
Now that’s how you sneaker shop…1 of the best episodes thus far. 🔥🔥🔥
Hi
GARDEN STATE PLAZA!!

We love you Liv! So glad you finally got your chance
The chick went hard.
Liv

In India the Off White x Air Jordan 4 Sail cost only $217
I’m so in love with her
Am I supposed to know who she is?
thanks for bringing the best in the whole world our smackdown champion
As a wrestler, buying 11k worth of shoe. Must be recently getting that champ bonus

3 grand for the Travis lows?! Puff Puff PASS
Dang she cashed out!! Go champ 🔥
I had to watch my baby Liv 😍😍😍😍😍😍🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪😝😝😝😝
11 bands they be getting over
Mix American lady called Lita fantastic 😍 Liv Ger Morgan
American German Liv Morgan with brothers
Those Travis Scott lows are selling for around $1100 on GOAT and she bought them for like $3000 yikes 😬
Not out of store and established. A Google for real
Great cops! They fleeced her on the Travis 1 lows though. I’m not sure what size she is but women’s 5.5 to 8 are at $1.050 to $1450 depending on the size.
GOOD CHOICE....
Hopefully we see some of these pickups in an episode of Smackdown when she does promos.
Enzos ex girlfriend
in love with her
Liv is life <3
I enjoyed this episode way more than I thought I would!!!
Fire episode 😮‍💨🔥
thought it’s corinna kopf for a second
She just wasted her WWE CHAMP bonus rn
why aren't we inviting Maria from sesame street, or Shakira, Cazzu,  also a lot of people here have been asking for a Paul Reubens haul with the infamous and controversial Herman's Nike dunk SB highs, or Daddy Yankee
i keep tabs on wwe here and there seeing stuff online i remember her a few years back but didn't really keep up with her so don't know much about her but it's great to see how far she has made it in wwe, often than not some wrestlers like her get totally wasted or held down.
Victoria Justice wife Vanessa Hudgens
Here to watch Liv sneaker shop... Liv loves her Jordans.... 💯😈👍😎✌️
Jesus loves you
PLEASE GET AUSTON MATTHEWS ON THE SHOW! HE’S A HUGE SNEAKER HEAD!!! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT!

🤔Go figure,They need a T. V.  Personality to help them buy athletic  shoes,to bad I cannot call Michael Jordan and say"Yo my brother come pick me up I need you to take me the store so I could buy me some new kicks" said no one ever. 😎
I can’t believe the outrageous prices for shoes!! Go to Walmart!

$3k for reverse mochas?! Sheesh
Nice Kicks by the way.
After retaining Smackdown Women’s title & being attacked by Rowdy Ronda Rousey at Summerslam this past week, Liv Morgan goes on a shoe spree looking for good kicks.
YES!!!!
Getting ripped off, a sneaker shopping classic.

How I can’t believe I got to watch a girl spend 11k on shoes!!!! Wow!!!!
Get Bun B and Westside Gunn on the show PLEASE!
elite milk
What's the endning beat?
I noticed on her IG that she was a sneakerhead.
Liv Morgan is beautiful,her personality is very nice,friendly and down to earth 🌎, im glad that she's the smackdown woman's champ,she deserves to have that championship👍.
Didn't think Liv was the type of person to drop a BAG like that.. She's the champ 🤷🏻‍♂️
Liv is amazing
How r them reverse mochas almost 3k did she get finessed or did this tape before they dropped lol
Definitely wasn't expecting that shopping spree, she killed it 👌🏽!          are those Travis Scott lows not out yet or is that the rate they're running for ?? 3k is loco 😵‍💫
She bad asf tho
Loved this episode, Liv was so bubbly. She has good taste in her Jordans too, 1's and 4's are always the best and she picked some dope ones!
Why did he show a pic of just her in a ring and just pics of random stadiums?
She spent more than The Young Bucks combined. She even smiled and said thank you after hearing the total.
Resale value 🤮
11k?! Why they gotta tax my girl like that smh
The killer bees wore Iowa dunks. They started it. Foh.
Dope 🔥🔥🔥
It’s her laugh for me!! 😍
morgan inthe bank defn stood up to the tribal chief on her shoe game
I know this show had wrestlers before. But Liv Morgan is def the last person i'd expect to show up.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yall could atleast sell them for retail
She went crazy! 🔥
Definitely one of my favorite athlete episodes of Sneaker shopping. I Absolutely adore Liv. She has great taste in sneakers and i'm glad to see her getting some shine as the SmackDown Women's champ. She deserves it!
Jordan 1 and dunks are bricks on feet...
Liv is the 🐐
Is it possible to display market value in addition to msrp when you show what’s on their feet?
Agg it's not a Pay-per-view joe🙄. Premium Live Event
Liv Morgan🥺💕💕💕
2.9k for those travis scotts!?? hella robbed lol
She’s the best!
Shawty cashed out, sheesh! 🔥 This was definitely an exciting episode for the audience, as well as for Joe. 😄
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
travis lows for 3k? xDDD what is this place
She spent more than the others who said they’re legit sneaker heads.
Congrats, being Champ has it's rewards. WWE, pay Liv more 👟👟💵💵💵💵
So u telling me she just bought 11 pairs of j’s for 11k …..that’s only 2.5k or 3k worth tho😕I’m lost asf🙁that means each shoe was roughly around 1k😳shi j’s ain’t nun but like 260 max
So much 🔥
well played Morgan
thats awesome...liv is so down to earth....love ya champ!!
Liv (Gionna Daddio (birth and much better name)) represented the wrestling industry well with this one! Great to see her shine
I'm glad to see Liv doing amazing things now that she's Women's Champion and it's well deserved in my opinion 🔥 🔥.
WE STAN A RICH QUEEN
Joe couldn't iron or steam his shirt before this LOL
SHEEEEEEESH 🔥episode!  SHE BOUGHT HEAT!
😂 she spending that summerslam check
Liv 😍💙
WE NEED MORE LIV MORGAN
THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME
THE GOAT
Nice choices
She is the greatest, just walks in with the Ones on! Goddess
Liv Morgan taking her title on sneaker shopping was 🔥
LOML!!! she cop some 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 she got that WWE champion money now!!
All jordans?? Boring shoes.
good taste
Bro when the cashier told her how much it was and she smiled I know that feeling bro when you know you got the money and you’re happy that your not poor anymore or at least have more than you had when you was young 🥴
Shheeeeesh. She went ham, didn’t know WWE was paying like that lol. Good for her
Those fusion reds with the black laces are kinda fire.
One word Masllah ❤️❤️
DOPE!!!! she got some.picks in there
Isn’t Shane the first. He used to wear Jordans all the time when he wrestled. Shane is from my time when the mindset was to wear new Jordans. He always had the new Jordans for matches but wore retros with suits. In my high school days people thought lesser of retros because they were cheaper. No one cared about my two pair of retro 8s in high school over the new 17s that came with a briefcase. 17s were 200, 8s were 165, the low 8s were like 130. Young people over saturated the retro market.
They really taxed on them Travis lows… StockX got em for 1200
why were the travis reverse mochas 2.9k?
I’m glad she dropped that much money cus she deserves it! She’s been waiting to get that big push in WWE and now that she finally has it, she has the money to spoil herself 🔥
YES I"M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT HER ON HERE
Luckily Ronda Rousey didn’t crash the complex .
Oh My Gooosh ❤️❤️❤️❤️ My champ Our Champ 💙 Wonder super girl.
She waited in line for what?!?🤔🤣
wwe superstars are very well spoken u can see how Liv is very respectful and kind
Great wrestling shoe Nike tawa
I LOVE YOU LIV <333
Nice
Liv Morgan and sneakers. I'm ready to make that commitment! 🔥🔥🔥
😂😂 Shane started it enzo and the bucks made it  modern
WWE $
Her tiny thanks at the end 🥹🥹🫠
Stadium goods taxing bruh 2.5k for travis’s? Naaa
3000 for TS Mocha Lows are a rip off straight up
The hottest in wwe rn 😍
The shattered backboards
She bought The Whole store
She definitely spent a bag....
She’s so fineee💕💕💕😩
With the Travis‼️
When Air Force 1s first came out I wanted a pair so bad. My Dad gave me a limit of $200. He thought that was idiotic but I REALLY wanted a pair so whatever. My sister drove me to The Mall to get them. $675. Of course we never bought them. I wanted them and I thought that was too much. Anyway we get home and when my Dad heard that he yelled at me for 20 minutes for wanting them in the first place. lol
NEW JERSEYS OWN LIV MORGAN!!! ❤️❤️❤️
They robbed the champ
Man I love liv morgan dawg.
Liv 🥰😍😍
Please only bring actual sneaker heads like her. Stop bring celbs that only want to do a promotion for some project they have coming
3 stacks for the Travis lows lol that ish just ridiculous
Dammmmmmm. 11k on shoes
PLEASE DO REY MYSTERIO! he loves his sneakers, please bring him and his son Dominic!

Congratulations Liv on being champion & your kicks were definitely fire. Great choices.
She just out spent all the complex sneaker celebs that I’ve watched! And Liv Morgan’s hella knowledgeable & interesting when it comes to sneaker shopping, by far my favorite video yet
She wasn't feeling the cashier 😂
Surprisingly good episode 👍🏾
Oh god some of the cashiers seem so serious. Was this one super nervous or genuinely unfriendly lol
Triple H must’ve given her a big budget 😂
The cashier lady gave me those hater vibes towards the end
Perfect legs 🤤
00:26 her tongue matches her jacket nice
Took the t-shirt straight out of the packet - those creases 😂
I wish I could afford shoes like this 😂   And make my size and width
The cashier tho?! 😍💘🤤😮‍💨❤️‍🔥🫠
I’m so happy for Liv Morgan!
Get Jade Cargill on here 😀
Liv lowkey my WWE crush ! Liv, if u see this hit my line boo
Cena started shoes in the ring .. no debate
It's to see her so happy, she deserves everything.
She’s so dope 🔥
As a foreigner I am not so familiarized with WWE or with Liv Morgan but she made some solid choices there, haven't seen them in a long time.
LIV!!!!
This is the moment I’ve been waiting for! Ever since her nxt area
Yeah cuz Shane o Mac wasn’t cost to costing in true blue 3s with the Nike air on the back foh
2949 for the TS1 low?! she truely got ripped off
$3,000 for reverse mochas 😂
Yo, is nobody gonna talk about how much they hosed her on some of those kicks?
Liv Morgan has really worked and earned her spotlight in WWE really proud now look at her.
She balled out differently cold
She actually copped some heat! Great episode 🔥
My baby girl LIV Morgan 😘🥰
She's beautiful.  And I'm so happy she finally won the belt. She just needs to polish her skills and she should be a great wrestler for years to come
Travis reverse mocha is only selling for 1800usd in Philippines, stadium goods robbed you
Joe La 95
🤞🏽🖤🤍
I never clicked on a sneaker shopping video faster than this one. Let's go Liv!!!
$3k for some reverse Mocha Travis’s, straight robbery
Shane McMahon is the first (although not an official wrestler I think) one I saw wearing sneakers in the ring.
She’s dating Bo Dallas
she had no hesitation she got that money
Air Morgan whatttttt
Who makes the music for this video? I love the beats.
Liv using that championship bonus 😤😤😤💯💯💙💙
Liv dropped a bag 🔥
She is cool, i like her!!
Stadium Goods out here robbing people with those prices..
She has good taste in 1s
Let’s get Pat Mcafee on the show. He’s got fans across YouTube, the NFL and wrestling. Also, he’s a big sneaker guy. He often talks about his sneaker purchases on his show.
Hey liv got a big pay check and she spend it on shoes
Let's go liv
Travis Scott “reverse mocha” 🔥🔥
She got that champ money now!
I thought for one sec this was Korina
She's beautiful
She cute for a wrestler tho
Kool dope video sneaker shop my favorite super star Liv 😍
Hate when celebs cop 1-2pairs in the episode. Props and mad love to Liv for goin innnnn and doing some damage.
My WWE crush does complex sneaker shopping the way everyone should do it
Liv Morgan, Roman Reigns, The Usos, New Day and Shane McMahon are my favourite Sneaker Heads in WWE 👟🔥🤩
Stadium Goods should be ashamed of themselves for those prices
Victoria Justice wife Vanessa Hudgens Liv Morgan Nicole Morrison
Liv dropped a bag
Do Americans wear anything other that Jordans or YEEZY? They ain't that great
She always had 1s on in the riot squad. I always wanted to see her collection so this is close
She ain’t gonna be champion for along with Charlotte flair comes back to WWE.  😂😅🤣
11k and she didn't flinch only smile 😍
she’s so sweet i love her🥲🥲
She didn't flinch at $11,000 drop, WWE bread must be good.
Love her selections, cannot go wrong with Jordan 1’s.
love a good mache shoutout!!
Shane McMahon started the sneaker trend in WWE !! No one can claim it!
I fw her vibe she’s very energetic and bubbly and she rocks heat 🔥
Glad to finally see her on here 😍
I love liv
I dont know who she is, I stop watching wrestling years ago, but mavaaaaaaan do I love her! 😂
i’m so happy for liv. she deserves her proper run in wwe
Liv is a legend
Great Guest, Liv Morgan is the best. We need more WWE Superstars on here. She is Sneaker Head 👟🔥🤩
Liv is slowly turning to a WWE Megastar and I'm here for it🔥❤️
Best ones in shoe game in WWE has to be Roman, Edge, Kofi, Shane Mcmahon, Liv, Carmella, and Nikki Bella. Most were already wisely featured here. Roman and Edge usually wear different pairs every night they have a promo and match it with their outfits
She got bags
She went in
She’s so bad 😫😫😫😫
😍😍👏🏻👏🏻
what a cutie
Liv Morgan is my favorite SNEAKERHEAD in wrestling period, especially in WWE. She isn’t the first person to start wearing sneakers in wrestling, but she is the best and main person who wears sneakers in wrestling!!!!!
YASSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE
She's a real sneakerhead.
Liv Morgan and Enzo Amore definitely have solid claim to being the first to wear sneakers consistently in the ring, back around 2014/2015 NXT days
SHES JUST BEAUTIFUL BRO 😍
Liv is just so likeable
Slowly becoming a fan of Liv, like here sneaker selections 🔥
Mommy
She is so adorable and her personality is so fantastic 😍
Maybe I won't!
amazing episode, as usual
Legend!!!!
Jheeeze Liv spent moneyyyy
Beautiful 😍 good video.
Liv is the best
I LOVE HER
They finessed my daug 🤦🏾‍♂️
I love seeing the wrestlers ball out !!!
She killed it 🤙
Yah
she was cool
She went crazy in there love it
Officially favorite episode 😍😍
Imma need the RATED R SUPERSTAR EDGE ON HERE!! Bc you can’t tell me Edge doesn’t have fire kicks 🤘🏽🤘🏽
I LIVE for LIV😍😍🔥🔥🔥
💥
I’ve been wondering we’re she gets her shoes
Liz is dope  and  pretty  she deserves  to shine  in the world she paid her dues
This is a major W
need her fr
Jordan 6
11k ain’t nothing when you’re worth 30mil!!
Her laugh, tho.
They straight taxed her on those reverse mochas.. 3k??? They're barely 1k right now lol.
MOMMY is LIVIn her best life🥺
She’s so good looking
The travis mocha at 2.9k while resell market is 1.2k !!!!!!
Liv is living, she dropped a bag! As for the wrestling in sneakers debate. John Cena started sneakers in wrestling. I’m sure some Indy talent  who couldn’t afford actual wrestling boots wrestled in sneakers, but John Cena crated the trend. Cena broke the mold of what wrestlers traditionally wore. Cena showed people in wrestling they can wear non traditional wrestling attire and don’t have to wear spandex and wrestling boots like a typical wrestler.
What a haul!
3k for Reverse Mochas 💀
That black card be hitting different
$11,000+ on sneakers....It must be good to be the champ. LOL. She deserves the title though tbh. One of the most improved wrestlers in the last 3-4yrs. I knew that bill was going to be high, lol.
What a great episode
This just made me love Liv even more❤️
Yo she picked up a lot of heat for the feet I like her sneaker game
She's so cut do
Hot and has good taste in sneakers. The perfect woman
Liv got good taste in shoes. The Air Jordan 1’s is the greatest sneaker of all time. I respect your shoe game Liv.
LIVVV MORGANN 2 things about her she loves shoes and she is the SMACKDOWN WOMEN S CHAMPION
She spends 11K And she did not even get a gift from the store
I loved this episode but jeez she bought everything 😂😂
She can play Harley Quinn she looks similar Margot
Got taxed
im out here still wearing vans smh
(starts to watch wrestling again)
Nobody cares about NJ malls in NYC. We have Queens Center Mall.
she got that champ money
11,000?? ok i need to put 8 of these back
...And she'd a sneakerhead.  Great choices Liv. She took all the heat home with her. 🔥 vid Joe & Complex!!!
Fire episode 🔥
I love Liv Morgan she deserves everything she’s getting rn
We need John Cena, Street Profits, The Usos next.
Now this is what we call a sneaker shopping..hotty with some hot haul of sneakers
Finally a guest what actually picks up some decent sneakers 🔥
Shane McMahon started it first
That laugh is contagious
She hot and ballin, dropping 11 bands like nothing sheeeesh lol
I think Roman Reigns has the coldest shoe game in wwe
next bring The Usos
Big Boy Cheng for sneaker shopping 🔥🔥🔥
Liv spending that Championship money 😆

Liv is so cool 😎 😍
3k for reverse mochas 😭😭💀
JERSEY 🔥
The one who started the sneaker game in wwe is definitely Shane McMahon.
The champ balled out 11k on sneakers
Joe gaining weight hard. Looking like Joe panda instead of puma
Her choice is fire 🔥
She’s a baddy no 🧢
Gotta go sneaker shopping with Brock lesnar cuz I'm really curious on what his sneaker type is
WWE bag is wild for her to drop 11K without flinching
Did she know the prices of the shoes? Lol
I wonder if the wwe comped this since she’s there as their champion
She fine!! Lol
I know it
Liv Morgan still champ yes
Mannn they taxinggggg
Sup champ how can I help you
She picked some great shoes.  If I had the money I'd be right there with you Liv!  She's the cutest, I love her.
No way those travis lows are almost 3k
they ripped her off for sure
1. Liv is such a hottie 🫶🏽 2. This is how celebrities should shop! Way to go Champ!!!!
JLP with the fresh white Tee, with the folding creases. 🤣
About time! We had enzo, the new day and even shane McMahon but having the smackdown women's champion is gold 💯
Dayumm the cash register worker  could have smile 😊 that’s why she said “ I won’t come back again “
She is so sweet
She’s gotta blacked looking vibe to her
Got much more than these mumble rappers
11k????????
Stunningly beautiful and has good taste in sneakers that’s wifey material right there ❤️
Liv is the Best champion ever
11 racks! Robbery without a gun smh.
Robbed her in front of millions 🤦🏽‍♂️
you know she was excited for this. she was always a sneakerhead.
Why some sneakers are so expensive in this video? 🤔
Aww she is like a human doll.
🥵🥵 this woman 😍
Travis Scott reverse mocha is 🔥🔥🔥
Episode was amazing but them mocha travis for 3 bands was a straight finesse.
Liv I love you 😘 but 11,000 lol no way 🙄
Yass The Champ shops in style!! 🖤❤
11k
Dammmm shoe rack ip
This cute little girl wrestles??
Complex has the best quality production on YouTube 💯
Liv taking her baby EVERYWHERE like a good mother should, has anyone enjoyed being champ more??
I love her so much
Out of all female wrestlers, u pick Liv Morgan?
How were the red thunder 4s more expensive than the Lightning 4s? Weird pricing
This is why she’s perfect. She got really good taste in kicks too just to give another reason.
Liv is bigg vibes
She spent more then most the rappers
SHE'S THE ONE WHO BEAT TRIPPLE H IN SMACK DOWN
Great video as always!
Liv's got that SmackDown Women's champ $ now lol
2949 for the travs aint no way💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
That’s Emma magnolia?
Liv 🤝 beast!
Shorty really copped out 👋🏽💪🏾
Prob one of the best episodes 🔥🔥
Should have Becky Lynch on this she has a nice collection
She got hosed on those Travis. Lol
Was not expecting her to drop 11K on sneakers! And solid cops too!   Love to see it. Watch her Liv
Great taste ! 🫶🥹
All her picks were fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruh. They charged her double for the Travis Scott Low 👀
Nice to see non mumbling drugged out rappers that don't say much sneaker shopping
11K … WOW … That’s a crime!!!
A she went crazy other wrestlers step it up
Love her infectious laugh!! 🥰
We need Mr 619 Rey Mysterio on here !!!
Now THIS is what you call sneaker shopping. Not those 1 pair guests.
Shane McMahon started the sneakers 🥱
What a boss interview! Crazy picks, all of them. 🔥
$3k for the Travis Scotts? How and why? $1200 Max
Liv went in!! Good episode, better than boring Beckham and Pogba.
I’m glad that you showcase just how high priced stadium goods is
Stadium Goods should be ashamed of themselves...I've seen guests spend way less and got gifted free Stadium Goods items
4s
WWE should keep her as champion she is very beautiful and relatable 🔥🏆she also got the drip 💧
Joe can talk a mute person into talking. Man is such a natural pro.
This is exactly what you would expect a Hypebeast to do with money..
Shane O'Mac was the first I saw rocking J's in the ring.
Liv got that CHAMPIONSHIP cheddar! 💵💵💵💵💵💵 Great episode!
Liv is the best you can tell she loves sneakers and wrestling always bubbly and excited
Now that’s some great picc up Liv, she has great taste in shoes unlike most of these females out here.
Woah, she dropped some serious money! Awesome hosting skills by everyone's champ JLP 🙌
🔥🔥
I know Stadium Goods is like that, but they are fleecing out there. Some of those (most) prices were ridiculous.
When she said she wanted the Royals, it seemed like she was actually pointing at the Dark Marina Blue's, but dude grabbed the Royals. It might've just been the camera angle that made it look like she was pointing at the Marina Blue's though. Lol
11K? Whoa ballin trip Champ gets hers go LIV
Homegirl woke up and chose violence… all 11k worth of it, while smiling might I add.
0:53 When you were young ... she's 28
One of the best picks 🔥🔥
She’s freakin awesome
Definitely got some heat
Great pick-ups. Wow… She’s got fine tase on kicks. Anyway, I thought she took the AJ1 Low Bred Toe not the Bulls
Never heard of her but dang she supa hot fiya....
Her laugh/smile is the best!
Fake wrestling is still a thing? That was rhetorical.
I knew liv was a true sneaker head when I saw her on g4, there was a liquid spill and first then she said as she jumped up. "Not on the shoes!"
Nah those prices are insane
Mainstream Morgan, baby!
My champ! 💥✨
I know sneaker stores tax but geez 3 racks for the reverse mochas is criminal
You can’t out beat 2011 John cena 😢
I was saying they should’ve had her on way before the Bella twins. Her and Carmella had better footwear in the times that I watched wwe
great guest! Love Her! ❤️❤️
Best pic ups I’ve seen on one of these 🔥🔥
Can this be the return of the big spending in sneaker shopping again what an episode🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She's too cute. Just want to hug her all day
