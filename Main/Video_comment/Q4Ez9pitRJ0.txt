Love
Awesome
We need more LGBT + representation in our military. Thanks for speaking up “Top”.  -sincerely a Gay Bottom!
how could i not have listened to this! love it
She is a sassy chick
I fucking love this woman
🌩
“It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can” ouch! Who is that about 😂😂😂
I have no idea what this just woke up inside of me, but I feel it
This was so very powerful
This looks witchy, like shes posessed and it looks ritualistic 😢 maybe more like an asylum of sorts
🔥🔥🔥
That last sentence, whoa!!!
Kate Bush and Tori Amos got an exorcist baby
Porque no la conocí antes?
my coven loves this
thats literally a man
Kinda Pagan Florence is my favorite Florence
Omg, Little Monster here 🤍 What am I witnessing? I feel like I’ve just been sprinkled with pure magic from her vocals and had a hex put on me at the same time. Florence is clearly a powerful performer, and I can totally see why Gaga loves her so much. Sending a big fandom hug to all the Florence fans out there — tell me where to start so I can dive in! 🖤💋
❤
There was one time i was chairing a meeting when the video I had been playing ended and this came on auto play 😅 One girl was like "Wait, put that back on" when i said "Oh, sorry, thats my music.. "
💜
This is the song for my sisters dance😂😂😂😂😂
every time I hear this song I feel like a modern witch wanting to burn the city and leave forever
Deja vu  .....Drumming song ❤🥁
RAINHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <3
For a long time I couldn't understand what the lyrics "always get my man" meant, although the song is clearly Florence's address to herself. But if you interpret "get my man" not in the sense of a romantic partner, then everything comes together very nicely in an appeal to one's humanity (mankindly) and recognition of one's mistakes and sins.
Florence regresa porfavor
Omg these witch vibes give me goosebumps
Ahahh Florence you  will never know how much I live your art …just a random human in the mix …you scream when I cannot and rage for me you do 🙏🏾 thank you
I feel so powerful when I listen to her. 🤩🙌🏽🗣️
Mannnn this song should be 10 times longer :D
IT’Z A PROMISE NOT A THREAT
This is what i imagine Amish girls on coke making a music video would look like.
Thank you for your support and for the ability to feel this way. ❤️💛💙
That's my favorite music ever. From start to finish this song gives me chills
i dont know why i like it     *confused *
Hail the Muse! ❤
Heaven doesn't exist when there's no accountability for child abuse
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Always keep my hair long just to dance with Florence and the Machine
I still haven't moved on from this.
Outstanding video.
The love of the world is good when people love one another.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Knowing that it was filmed in Kyiv under the Russian bombs, it is even more terrifying :(
Pelo amor coloquem e disponibilizem as legendas em outros idiomas quando poratarem no YouTube gente😢
Fucking masterpiece
Yo she did a haka.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Reminds me of Akram Khan's Giselle Ballet (chereo and score)
a brilliantly composed masterpiece florence is a true writer
This is great 😊
Florence nunca decepciona, ella es simple es genial
Yasssssssssss
This song should be the main theme of the Marvel Agatha series
This is How i see music
how much of this is you and not them?
eu queria ter esse clipe tatuado na minha CARA
Me parece un aquelarre, bendecidas sean sabias hermanas!!
Handmaid vibes on a summer solstice
Radagon is -Marika- Florence

So mote Be.  Ashe!  #MyGodessDancesBarefooted #AcrossTheStage
Sister I love u 🥰
❤
Florence doesn’t just sing songs, she casts spells
*melts in wonderment* ahhh Florence 🌌😮‍💨🥹
Why aren’t more people talking about how eery it is, the breathing and slight movement at the end being as though she’s literally hanging from a noose
I adore this song so much. This video feels like the spellcasting sequences from the recent Suspiria film
Taylor is wearing the same shoes in Fortnight as the women do here. Heavy influences.
Who’s here because of florida ❤️‍🔥 from TTPD ❤
Nobody wants heaven. That's why we live in he'll.

Goosebumps and tears at the same time.  Wrack my brain.
I hope that last bit isn't as bad as it sounds :(
Flannery O’Connor once said that ‘Florence may not be Christ centred, but she is certainly Christ haunted’. As many good artists often are. She often sings of biblical and spiritual themes and this particular work of hers is a dark and terrible and beautiful example.  She’s such an incredible talent ❤ ✝️
Those kind of songs are the light shining through the dark that - at times and sometimes at lenghts - befall us all as we wander this earth, confined to our mortal bodies. This precious art is - to me - an expression of life's meaning: Strife for balance Strife for love Strife for peace
The oa
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I looooove this flamenco 💃🏾 vibe!!!
@florencemachine could you do a cover of White Rabbit? Your gorgeous voice would bring such a dynamic rendition of this classic! Would love to hear it! 🙏
The most brilliant, yet underrated talent in existence. She deserves all the love in the world.
ohh this gave me chills the second I heard it! thank you for giving us your art <3
Me lembrou muito Suspiria, The OA - eu amei o clipe e a musica
What time is it ever there is weird but do you need a comb ?
🏊
so u dealt with the devil ?
I’m not surprised you have E.T feet
Masterpiece!
Currently geeking tf out because I do very similar choreo when I'm listening to this song !! It's like the body just knows what to do when given this music
Send this to my husband moments before he got hit by a car and died.
Not in my heaven. No artificial intelligence.  No machine.  Heaven is not there
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
😮 wow!!!
So I only held you by white hands under an umbrella of streaks of clouds
This feels like how  it would have been like for women accused of witchcraft during the trials- just to be a woman alone- noose around their necks- hanging one by one- the sadness in the dancers- this just unlocked some memory of a life I have never known before.
She is definitely ensorcelling me.
This is true and good witchcraft and I ❤❤❤ it. I dedicate it to my late friend Paul who struggled and lost to depression.  Im on the same road. I hope i find a fork.
"Super Human Light"  With Your Pure Love  I felt your fire Saw your super human light  Just a small thing burning and eating me alive with love Was it love? I loaned you my power through time Told you that you were mine  AND I WAS YOURS! Bound! I turned out my search lights that night Forgot and misplaced my super human light  In those decades that past, I felt something I knew, but what or who could it be  It ingulfed me in the airport, at my work, in my house, down the street, at the bar, and along the river.  A brief moment of extacy, I didn't know what it was,  Looking around me to find the source I didnt know who or what I was looking for, all I know is that I was always left wanting MORE.   In the years that followed I was hollowed and as I was dying, I glimpsed into silver and saw those eyes staring back at me saying Where the fuck are you? I flew across the ethers and had my way with a stranger  He said We've never met? And I said no!  Three deaths later, I rose from the ashes and collected all my powers through breaking time and now I'm all MINE resting in my power shining super human light on all the ships waiting in my harbor of love.   For Florence and Lady GaGa give it a go!
Fol my man x much love 💕
❤
Damn
i love you
she a baddie she showing her pantie
This album remembers me to the Suspiria (2018) movie
Kindergarden ,schooll,camps
Reminds me of the dancing scenes in Suspiria🖤
Such an incredible song but too short
😱🙏🏼🪔👍🏼

American Florence Story: Coven
She is a witch by her own right. Just like me, only far more powerful. In witchcraft the women are always more powerful. Men serve them, its custom.
Reminds me of Kate Bush in the day
“I’ll turn your sea to a desert” ….  thinking of revenge. I keep listening this since March of 2022. Florence and production made all music videos for Dance Fever here in Kyiv, this makes my heart warmer. We will wait for you in Kyiv again, Florence💌
anyone else getting Midsommar vibes from this?
yesss
I would say further, Heaven is here even if you don't want it  cause there aren't  heaven or hell in another place. Both him are here...
Amazing, pure magic
I want to wear one of the outfits and go running through an open field as fast as i can🍃
What in the Suspiria is happening to me.
Perfect song for The Handmaid's Tale.
🥰😣😣😢🙈🙉🙊💔
Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it Oh, bring your, boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
... Tristan and Isolde will appreciate your sacred portion ( anti-poison), Ma'ams ( Ladies)!!!...this video is about a tale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp_s-BHPxvc
This is probably my favorite song from this album, I love the intensity of it, it's beats and the way it flows so perfect and smoothly into Daffodil. <3
Im like so obsessed with this song its not even funny. Im upset its not 10 minutes long😂😭
When I first heard you singin' this song at mita festival I knew heaven was there and I was being blessed amen 🥰
This is ART.
GOOSEBUMPS!!! Wow, this is POWERFUL!
"and every song I wrote became an escape rope"
Cool  Peace  Love  RFS Israel *.
My god this song has the merit of lasting a long time... I'm on my hunger ! LOVE
"I'll turn your sea too a desert!" So empowering <3
Loving the Pat Benater dancing influence 👌
Clearly seeing THE MORRIGANS INFLUENCE
sounded a bit like Scotland, The Lumineers. Nice.
The whore of Babylon is getting ready for her groom. Listen. A word to the wise is sufficient.
Still coming back for this song 😂❤
Damn, this gave me goosebumps!
this choreography has so many ¨suspiria¨ vibes
Then fact that this video was filmed in the university of KPI where I used to study is heartbreaking
Women are doing amazing things
Don't let the elite disarm the proletariat, our voices must be heard. Free our bodies from the state, free our minds from the manipulation, free our children from the shackles of colonialism!
I luv this song ! Master piece ! And i really wondering how does mix of Britney Spears and coconut smells ?! ❤
I'm certain she isn't humen she something else like a fairy or goddess
Angel I would like you to be a guest of honour at my wedding 8th of August in Chilligo Queensland Australia. Id like you to sing if you wouldn't mind. Honoured
Florence you are a gorgeous sweat bad and I love you 999like by Holywood mo raad judges International
Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it  Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert  More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going  And I ride in my red dress And time stretches endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man  And every song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
💜
Does anyone else see those end noises as execution platform shutter sounds as it opens, when they release the person to hang? Or am I just that dark & goth LoL It immediately felt that way to me. To open her gig with this gorgeous chant really casted a beautiful magic over her shows. & we helped! How rad is that? Love her soooo much.
Florence is a legit headcase! I'm sure this song's about suicide. She has come out and said it but... Very Kate Bush The Sensual World era imo. Fucking phenomenal!
This kinda sounds like a sea shanty
rape culture is masonry.
Oh my gawd. I had to look up the lyrics just to realize what this was. A confession.
does this song and video not give off "Rite of Spring" vibes?
Satanic ritual
Love the dancing, as always and amazed at this witchy song
Does anyone know if it was all shot at once?
дякую😍😍😍😍😍
This song is too short.
UaU.
Currently laying on the floor in front of my aunt's gigantic speaker listening to this album on loop. This song makes me jump for joy and sing manically
Your known as the Demon Envy. I know. I have faith in my medical science. Your head will be returned and you may step down from Evil. MBQ.💕
Who fuck Is Bad Bunny 🤮 ?  The only artist that have magic Is Florence.
Banshees,brah
no one gets her like i do like this is so me
heaven is NOT THERE.......
Something about this song makes me incredibly emotional, lyrics aside. Seeing the choreography just seals the deal! Amazing, just wish it were longer, alas I will hit replay
love the video and it hits good with the song
This video becomes even more powerful with the loss of women rights in the US, takes on a whole different meaning.
The OA movements 👁
Florence is one of a kind, but this type of video is too americanized... Please go back to your roots...
Looks like a scene from the wonderful movie The OA!  The scene where she travels to another dimension https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO6Sseqd-_Y  This is the final scene of The OA season 2, but the ending i remember is: he notices her flying, as in the below scene she goes down, but the girl she was looking for, notices him watching from another dimension and remembers who she is, she climbs the ladder to the window gives him her hand, in blind faith (because she only heard him, did not see him), and then they travel higher  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJbTrQgjeHY  Curious where she leads in Season 3 and onward!
My heart is beating so hard. Most beautifully aquelarre I have ever witnessed.
Seems demonic
is this witch stuff? EDIT: Yea this is witch stuff
😮 wow
this is a MASTERPIECE
Increíble
Bro this is scary
I get goosebumps everytime i listen to this. That's how you know the incantation is working.
Wow  I can't t thank you enough for giving me hope that there is others out there who feel or can at least empathise with myself
bewitched by florence
"I'll turn your sea to a desert" is the most "mess around and find out" line ever.
Come and fly with me Come and die with me Come, shed your tears and cry with me.  Let us loose everything that we are Let us take everything and leave it afar Let us become so lost and then find who we really are.  Come fly with me...for all eternity   Let us live and die together And rise from the ashes..Anew.  For you Em ...love you.
Getting Big God vibes in this video
My dream is to see her in concert!
Hallelujah
forever never seems that long until youre in it.
Great song 💖
Barroco
And every song I wrote     Became an escape rope    Tied around my neck     To pull me up to heaven
i'm gay
this gave me chills! i love it
She is just so unique. The lyrics, choreo and just everything. Wow.  Also, the "ooooh-ooh-ooh" melody sounds like the one from the Reign theme song!
Her music always takes me to a spiritual new world, I feel euphoria when I heard her sing and can't wait to see her for the 3rd time next year and her new material.
Now it feels strange without the breath at the beginning of "Daffodil" right after, I've come to feel like these two songs are part of the same whole.
Gahhhhh she opened her show with this the other day and it was everything!!!!!!!!!!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌
I can pretty much hold my breath for the whole 2 minutes and 16 seconds! Like I have a choice!
🌙🖤
This is a masterpiece
🤍🤍🦋♥️🦋🤍🤍
I still can't get over how she dies here and the next track is her reviving and then I myself died *does cartwheels in her honour*
I like this. Thank you
She really does have a unique voice. & she's got a cross between Stevie nicks & Kate Bush vide goin on.  I dare say that's CUSHTY WELL DONE congratulations
This song is just so mesmerizing... I've listened to it over and over and the end lyrics still give me shivers! 😲
Strikingly similar to Scotland by The Lumineers at the one minute mark!
Demonic asf
She's a witch, change my mind
I cant stop  watching this videos and listening to this songs and music. This is getting better and better every time.  💜💚💜💫
Tears. Literal tears at that choreography. Someone give the guy an award already!
The Queen 👸 of the coven !!!
I am convinced that Florence is a goddess and I don't know her name yet. Perhaps another time.
This made me cry
PERFORMANCE is FLORENCE, every song is a master piece of art and a I like all the passion and details involved in every act. You’re a GODDESS!
Creepy
I am holding on to the conspiracy that the OA is going to come back and accepting this as a sign
thank you for creating this album
With everything going on with roe v wade this song encompasses all of the emotions. Like a war song.
The best ever, ever. Aabsolute owner of my heart 🇧🇷
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
We are awake, now, Florence. You can relax, now.   🙂 Thanks again, my friend, I am eternally grateful to you and everyone involved  🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 ❤️❤️❤️ 💡💡💡 (Can someone make sure she sees this???)
Flo killed it! Brilliant!
Draw me a circle and I'll protect!
Heavily thanks for your Energy @Florence
Thank you Florence 🙏🏼🙏🏼  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Listening to the album, it immediately made me think of both witches and, somehow, of the movie Susperia. Just read an interview in which Florence states the choreography is based on witch circle-dancing, which was also the basis for the choreography in Susperia. Amazing how accurately F+M have recreated this atmosphere in a song. Perfect for the also witchy Doffodil. Also, the art for the CD sleeve made me think of Alisteir Crawley...
Really happy to see everyone enjoyed this song as much as I do. Heart melts at the line “heaven is here if you want it”
Magical, primal, sacred, intimate and fierce. Like a hazy memory from another life time.
Anybody gonna mention that it’s the Haka?
And every song I wrote  Became an escape rope Tied around my neck To pull me up to heaven
Incredible artistry from this woman. Everyone involved in this song and video... major kudos.
Her voice, truly just amazing....she for me are one of the few artists that gives me these beautiful chills... her voice is healing for me... truly a wonderful gift her voice is....
Glory to Ukraine ! Glory to the heroes !
I love this so much 😭
Прямо история ведьм из Салема💔😔 за то,что они знали больше других,их повесили.. а сейчас пришло время снова собрать ковен(феминизм) и Флоренс во главе этого ковена - верховная ведьма💔
O coreógrafo assistiu The OA com certeza
Daaaaaaammnn
Ne..klip hrozný.. nezlob se...
At about 1:09 the "ooooh" vocalization is the exact arrangement from the Lumineers "Scotland" released in 2009. I wonder if FATM are fans.
Omg the vibe is almost reminds me of The Queen. Freddie mercury
What a cool video! ♥️
Heaven is here if you want it, you just need to force your heart to keep beating.
Soul tingling
This whole album is a feminist anthem for sure. Absolutely loved it
❤❤❤
The best thing about Florence all the way to when Lungs came out which where I started with the group is she couldn't be anymore Original as she always has been. Her voice,  moves, and over all aura she creates. I'm so glad to be at the right age and time to enjoy her music and see her progress ever further. She reminds me of when  Annie Lennox started our. LOVE YOU FLO!!!
Ok this reminds me of OA 🥲 love love love it
👑
if you 're a witch you surely will fell in love with this song
I need more of this!!!!
She speaks of the new earth! She is a starseed who has embraced her mission! Well done beautiful I see the pain in the Devine feminine it’s our time!   Now rise phenix the ansestors have been expecting you!
Beautiful
I love this song.  The whole album is giving me strength during hard times.
A beautiful coven in their daily affairs.
I'd love to see a collaboration with the ladies of delta rae... Swampy witchy vibes unite
Love Florence and the Machine... but the last bit sounds oddly like a Over the Rhine bit.
“Heaven Is Here” is the second single from Florence + the Machine’s fifth studio album, Dance Fever.  The single was announced on March 6, and came out on the following day, just two weeks after “King”. On the announcement Florence Welch explained that during lockdown she “wanted to make something monstrous” and “Heaven Is Here” and the “clamour of joy, fury and grief” that is the song was the first thing that came out.  The artwork picture, just like the other one from this era, was taken by American director and photographer Autumn de Wilde, who also directed the music video for “King”.
I like the way those dancers look. They are all so different looking with their own healthy beauty, and not some generic flavor of the month being subliminally pushed on us.
The story in the song came to me last night in a dream. It's a group of witches putting a curse on the town right before being hung. The sound effects bring the whole thing together, down to her last gasping breaths after the board floor gives out and she's hung.
You’re music has ALLways spoke to me. Chills. I will choreo to this, plus 2 others on the album. I love this choreo. Reminds me a little of Martha Graham technique. Not what I felt… but I feel it. Thank you for your creativity and talent and for sharing it with us.
*( Absolutely ·  "Setting·The-Bar"  · When It Comes TO [°Artistic~Expression] Through *MUSIC ! )                                                     €¥£    ^
This is a spell... it is literally a beautiful, amazing, masterpiece of a spell. ♥
This is like a throwback to the Drumming Song music video
chills, chills and more chills, now I can safely say FLORENCE sis you give art a definition !
blonde hair black chic right side. someone give her an acting job. she was out here giving it.
GOD chose you and JESUS loves you 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥳
silly moo its so dramatic
Did I not think of The Crucibles watching this video...make way for the coven...even listening to the lyrics, sounds like chanting a spell
I don't know if people realise that this is actually ART
My daughter is ten. Flo and her crew are very deep. I love and adore her music I let my daught watch the lighter songs and show her what real artists are and how they work with their lives and videos. She adores her although I probably wouldn't take her to one of their shows. But I'm thinking I probably  could she love the music.I like her to know what a real artist with ability and the fact to me that she seems so down to earth. I want my daughter looking up to a real person. Someone with a good heart and soul Flo and  crew your that!! my girl and I love you. I will be there when you come to Australia next year will be a first to see you in real life...I can't bloody wait.🥰🥰🥰
Well, I've loved her since I was in middle school ( I'm 30) and I've just realized she's also a witch 😆  She's my favorite witch now!
I definitely see the influences after watching suspiria after florence herself recommended it on her IG account to set the mood for dance fevers release.   I love this video even more now. Florence is art!
THE OA IS HERE, THE OA IS HERE!
I was like wth is this when I first heard it and now I’m obsessed with the lyrics, singing, and production. No clue how I got here
COME TO BRAZIL
COME TO BRAZIL
COME TO BRAZIL

OBRA DE ARTE MEU DEEEEEUS

God this hits so hard.  My Queen ✨🌈💖 Can’t wait to see you in DC my first concert ever and it’s going to be magical as fuck.
"and every song i wrote became an escape rope tied around my neck to pull me up to heaven"
Florence and Flamenco vibes??? Does it get more perfect than this?  WAIT, FLORENCE! IT WAS NOT A CHALLENGE! Ohhhh...there she goes.
We love you Florence! Waiting to see you at your concert in peaceful Kyiv 🇺🇦❤️
👑🫀
i'm obsessed with the choreography, i've lost count of how many times i've watched this also, the dark hum with the distorted vocals accompanying the spoken word at the end sent a shiver up my spine the first time i heard it, like being possessed, and i felt like one of the dancers at 0:57, it was AWESOME
WOW
Love gli
Florence ♥️♥️♥️
Crazy awesome!!!!
I think this is so far my favorite from her new album. Amazing group of dancers, they are in all the new videos so far, and also wearing the same outfit. Loove the energy and the choreo of this track grrrrrrrrrr !!!!! ❤‍🔥
Two straight minutes of goosebumps. Incredible performances by all.
😍
You won't turn the sea into a desert the sea will turn the desert into a sea.big god florence
EN EL CIELO ESTA JESUCRISTO...TAN MEDIA PERDIDA..FEMINISTA
Love you Florence.
Seems like the title should be for a more positive or actualized song.  Otherwise it's just more hackneyed irony.  This still strains, it angry bordering on bitter, as if for Florence at least, heaven isn't here yet.
This is simply unbelievably good. I've seen such talent and sensibility so few times in popular music! This is just... wow.
Wow..,what a Performance..
OMG YESSS!!!!!!!!
She does interesting songs but her videos are a work of art in themselves !!
Ela e bruxa mesmo! amoooo
An A24 Production.
Yeah, baby. Heaven is here. North Pole, here on the flat radial disc Earth...where Matter meets Pattern. Maternal meets Paternal. Anyhow, the Sword waits for you..... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNjx20x_0NE
this is my favorite one so far
This album bouta go crazy
This is Florence s moment and she is shining 🌟
Грандиозная🥺мураашки✨✨✨
The FEROCITY! I wonder if any these are the dancers from Big God.
This made me feel like starting a coven. I missed ya Florence 💜💜💜
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Art.
Ahhh yes my favorite kind of Florence & the Machine song, the kind where it sounds like she’s casting a hex on your family. Obsessed with this
💗
So powerful.
I do this dance every morning as i get out of bed in my favourite flowing red dress
I've watched this multiple times a day since it came out. Just can't get enough!
If you don't invite Jesus into your life you will go to hell.  Please wake up!  Think of your soul!  Jesus Christ is the way, truth and LIFE!
Repent and turn to Jesus. No matter who you are every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus IS Lord. Yes, even you Florence!
Suspiria vibes, oh my god.
Essa musica deveria ter no minimo uns 10 minutos Florence
This here is a spell being placed upon all that watches it!
The choreography is incredible - it gives me Pina Bausch vibes. A war song for women, love it.
Powerful, stunning. Every single word or body movement is ...  visual perfection. A movie. What an enchanting way to represent women's world. So deep... Stay safe and healthy, peace from Italy
Mar 7, 2022
Am I the only one hearing something from “Scotland” by The Lumineers? Anyway, love the song. And the video. And of course Florence and the Machine.
CRYING!!! IT'S TRULY  ART!
definitely gives me Which Witch vibes. love this so much
You are a genious
Such a true poet and artist she rocks
Witch
The choreography is fantastic; raw and vulnerable. I can feel and connect to the inner, brutal rage of the woman here. Florence always brings out the most inner parts of the soul and puts them to words. Bravo!
This was so freaking sick! I love it!
Can't beat real music with artistic creativeness <3
Is it wrong that I enjoy when Florence yells at me?  😉
Looks like a DEgas painting <3
Support Ukraine!!
Florence here jumping through parallel worlds.  Such a great performance.  Love sing the dance for the OA
May God protect this Beautiful Real Life Angel.
What is it with artists nowadays and making songs that last less then 2.50 mins.. like you go through all that to make a 2 min song???
There's no one else like Florence. I just love her.
Love your music and videos, you're an amazing artist!
II call u.
This is masterpiece
Sucederá alguna vez  el croossover Florece + Mariana Enriquez?
I cannot stop watching this.  Obsessed.
This was filmed in Ukraine
All of them have such nice hair :)
🔥
My Fav song on this album.
Ιερό. Τελετουργήσιμο.
I re-discovered you again, Flo. You're the oldest sister I've never had. You're my other mother. You're Patricia. You've ended my dog days... You're the one I go to when I don't know my feelings. Third eye will always speak to me in the deepest way. Is the song I go to when I don't feel myself...   Tell me, Florence, when you gesture how you stab yourself, how you stab your womb...What did you have to sacrifice? Or is it a silent screaming of how you're suffering? Of how you mourn something you have lost?
My Queen is comeback with all her magnificent talent.
Reminds me of witch trials for some reason :) amazing song. Does anyone else think she is like the Stevie nicks of this time??
The OA
This song came out a little too late for The Hunger Games.
Дважды посмотрел. Это Салем?
WOW Очень круто, мурашки
Love for witches!
Molto bella, molto potente! ❤️
This is such an artistic masterpiece 😍💜
Lyrics:   Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it Oh, bring your, boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
Ahhhhhhh como essa mulher é perfeita 🇧🇷❤❤❤❤
THE OA MOVEMENTS?!?!?!?!?!?!?
This is feral and wild and powerful!
I really like that this song is on the "harder" side. It has serious Suspiria vibes and I live for it.
It's a shame this is to good to be played on the radio, it's to arty for kids these days.
Amazing tableau
♡
Cult???
VABBÈ
This song could be the theme of the Discovery of Witches series.
Isaiah 50:2  When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to deliver you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.
I love the choreography
Sorry, but, am i the only one that hears "When Doves Cry" by Prince?
Florence, Pina Bausch is looking at you from above, with an approving smile
Full. Body. Chills.
All I want is to also engage in ritualic dance led by ginger Welsh witch
FATM doesn't just perform. They are the true essence of Art, the depth of their performance conveying the depth of  book or a painting. They elevate music to be contemplated. So theatrical and orchestral!
I truly do not know why but it definitely has The Handmaid's Tale vibes. Love it! As always they are purrrrrfection! :)
The most beautiful thing I saw in years 👏
Well that's a Coven I'd love to join!
I just got tickets to see Florence in November, I’m so beyond excited! I’ve been a fan since I was 13, when Lungs came out & haven’t had the chance to see her until now 💜
Thank you! From all Ukraine with 💙💛 Pray for us.
When im forced to know about that person in any way all i think is “i survived her.”
❤️❤️ Ser perfeito!
And I ride in my red dress ❣️🌟
Florence and the machine never disappoint me.
This whole album is nothing but heat
SHE WROTE A HAKA!? OMG
Flawless Florence strikes again 🥰🥰😍😍❤❤
I don’t know why, but yes, I love the moves and little voiceeffects! There is Fire! And I think, That I know a lot of this Element! Hey Florence, would you give me a bit of your Beauty? Just one percent for the machine, please!
Day 3 asking for a collab with @hozier for the Virgo-Pisces axis supremacy✨
✊🏼 💯
I’ve never had an artist who makes me understand the raw beauty within femininity
Short and sweet. They never last. Through the night doomed to hit repeat. Gladly
this song scratches my brain in way idk could be possible
The OA ta diferenthy
Florence and the Machine has come with a vengeance.
Awesome!  Thank you, shared.
This song is so powerful in so many ways. To call it spiritual would be an understatement
Me arrepio 😍
erinnert mich einwenig an kate bush . kate sang nicht nur sondern performte ihre lieder und lebte sie durch und auch florence tut es. so werden geschichten erzählt einfach und emotional, künstlerisch wertvoll. reminds me a bit of kate bush. kate not only sang but performed her songs and lived through them and so does florence. this is how stories are told simply and emotionally, artistically valuable.
Delighted to see Florence has gotten the Greek Chorus she deserves.  (This music video is going to be living rent free in my head for a very long time)
💕💕
o culto começa 20h aos sabados, irmãs
Какая бредятина.
Hollywood destroys and burn everyone who gets too close to it with very few exceptions. Florence sadly ain't one of those.
Big God vibes 👏🏼👏🏼
👍👍👍
fuck me this is amazing
I think Florence is telling us she’s a witch or something through this album and these girls
Florence your music has changed my life. You are the most incredible artist. A vessel from heaven. Thank you Flo I love you so much
Is it me or is she ripping off Kate Bush in this video🤔
If I had to liken Florence to any past lady.. it would have to be Joan of Arc. Whatever Florence does, she absolutely Kill's it. Just love her.
Love florence...just love her
👉🏻💎🍀
So we casting spells now. I live.
Am i the only one seeing the movie Suspiria? These dancers and everything reminds me of a witch coven, dancing for a ritual 🔮✨✨✨
This is the first time since her debut album that I've been genuinely blown away by Florence. THIS is the kind of music I've wanted from her forever. This voice deserves this level of creativity.
Shout out to the blonde black lady on the right. Youve got so much emotion. Its captivating.
This Is a midsommar sequel.
reminds me of Aurora!!
Powerful. Stunning. Witchy. Embodiment of what it is to be woman. IN LOVE.
I believe I've just seen the evolution of Miss Florence Welch what a talent also along with her band The machine their combination is" what's music now not a question and answer!!!!!!!!!🎶♥️"
I'm a little suspicious with some issues that I can't talk about without bleed on twitter, so... just know that we understand and know.
I feel feral when I listen to Florence. Just had my first listen and damn it made me cry
All i can say is this song makes my skin buzz... violently ethereal is my only discription for her sound these days
Brilliant
Wow 😍!!
Florence... Non smetti mai di trasmettere e puntare in alto... Sempre fedele al tuo modo di scrivere... Al modo di decifrare le emozioni umane... Dritta come una spada, penetri nei nostri cuori...
I've got goosebumps.
It's like Kate Bush and Byork had a child 🤔
Okay what is this? So far no song of that new album clicks with me. This is nothing like her previous tracks.
You are just badass Florence ❤️
Lol this song draws out my primal instincts it's actually crazy
Increíble
Looks like a group of witches
Weird
My GOD!!!
It's look like WITCHE'S dance" I loved!
These videos work so well together. A continuing work of art. I feel like this makes up for the concept album about a witch she didn't make.
Wwwwooowwww!!!! Strong!!!!!
PERO AAAAAAAAA
What in the Midsommar?
this made me feel.
So strong. It is almost like music could transport magic.
When I think I have F+M figured out... hearing this makes my mind suddenly scramble to find the open fields to feel their sound rain all over me. This will be my happy place for many, many months to come.
Is that The OA dance am livin
что творит, что творит! супер
Midsommar...
cant get over this
The fact that they don’t have any Grammys is criminal.
Obsessed. This song is a portal to connect with our primal source within. Florence is my favorite artist. I buy everything she puts out.
완벽하다..🤍🤍🤍
It reminds me of the OA! #savetheOA
This woman is so underrated. I’m speechless..
Incredible 🔥💚
Disgusting. I associate this movement towards the abdomen with abortion, which I see in a negative way. On the principle that she is telling us, that not taking responsibility killing leads to "heaven".
And she comes, saving me from myself with her art...
Sempre me salvando de mim mesmo
Isso é perfeito, que bela criação ❤️
Strong Midsommar vibes
Thank you sooo much for your support! Great thanks from Ukrainian girl who adores your music! Слава Україні! Героям Слава!🇺🇦
Looks like a ritual
Are these The OA movements?!!!!
"We're going to open a portal and save them"
King shit 👑
One of the few musicians who has been making music for years with no artistic compromise. She has never lost her voice or her soul ❤
Anyone know what period this clothing would have been around? I'm not good with that stuff but I need a dress like this asap.
This give me Suspiria vibe, wow.
Beautiful performance
Caraca, visceral como sempre Florence. Parabéns, vem aí um álbum daqueles de tremer a casa. <3
The way I'm obsessed with this song is just unhealthy, love you Florence ❤️
НЕТВОЙНЕ
Amazing.
Is like the soundtrack of Midsommar
Giving such strong OA vibes.  Absolutely love this!!!
The new Supreme
Just WOW!👌
omg I needed this so bad, I've missed her, and can't wait to get her new album, I feel like this is a fusion of her last two albums, the style and instrumentals. She has such an amazing strong voice.
Same shit different century
Sent this to my friends and they made fun of it… im getting new friends
That is amazing
Absolute angel on earth
This is growing on me still but I'm starting to like it King was the same but My Love I loved instantly
This is my absolute FAVOURITE song of this incarnation so far!!! Embodiment of POWER and the RUTHLESS embrace of self truth, self expression RAW feeling heaven and hell are blurred... we join you in this timeless limbo... we share the growth within this cycle... we dance with you in the magic of the circle... LOVE LOVE LOVE
I need stevie and a shawl in this arrangement 🤎🤎 this is beautiful and shows true artistry. The dancers are fantastic and make this feel cinematic and florence is just divine. Shes chanelling it 500% and I love it!  **I say "it" because I am lacking the words to properly describe what I mean... maybe I'll find them later
Absolutely sublime
Love that flamenco-ish clapping... 🌺
This is so intense!  It took me a couple viewings to realize what it reminds me of - it's almost like a haka (the traditional Maori war dance/chant).  Not saying this is any kind of cultural appropriation at all, but it has that same fierce energy.  I love it
"And all of the fish, let them flounder    I went to the water, drank every drop    I’ll turn your sea to a desert."    how she delivers it in the video. Power. Love these words.
You think it could’t get better, and than she does
Play a Volta!
Fucking hell that was amazing.
Can music videos win Oscar’s?!?
This reminds me of Midsommar
В мене завжди такі сильні мурашки,коли я слухаю її пісні...з дитинства і до цього моменту.
Theatre and cinema at the same time
all hail the high priestess
Ooooo god
This song is so addictive
She is channeling something fierce here. I love it.
it must be so fun to make these videos
Crazy amazing
My favorite video so far from the series
I love her so much
It seems They copied the choreography from the series THE OA.
Hell is here
Her and Lana Del Rey are hands down the top two female music ARTISTS of our generation.  Beautiful.. just like all she does.  Uplifting in these harrowing times.  ❤️
omg they "get it"! euphoria!
Absolutely fantastic Florence is an angel By the way: Now we know the answer to a very important question It's RED 🤩
Esos pasos eternos cuando recién entiendes este mundo. 🩸
Best
This video was filmed in Ukraine back in November. #IstandwithUkraine
OMG the theatrics were amazing!!! 🤩👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Florence is a goddess. Great song and performance.
Idk, the footsteps and the screams in background are a little bit disturbing. 🤔
What does this spell do?
Florence can I be a part of your coven
#savetheOA
Hold back your anger
What happened to the great tunes, Florence? Too much dramatic, pretentious, performance art. Not enough of the rousing tunes and deft songwriting, that made everyone a fan in the first place. I went to one of the concerts for 'Ceremonials', and it was incredible. But nearly everything released since then, hasn't approached those heights.
Love this! 🙌❤️
✨⭕️ ✨
I am speechless. This is superb!
Florence + Campbell's soup advertisements...ugh gross
For those of you not hip to the meaning of this video. . . .  Florence is a witch, she is mocking Jesus, and her messiah is Lucifer.
If this video can bring a new season of OA back on screen, I will love you forever.
Pride in to be your fan
This gives me midsomar vibes all over again
I might be tripping rn, I've never heard Florence's voice non-singing, but @1:40 really sounds like Brit Marling's voice. Am I going crazy or is somebody else earing it? Maybe they have a similar voice and that's all 😂
The OA lives 🤍
Can someone plz give their interpretation of this 😭
I want to scream now Flo☮️🎤💯🎶❤️🖖 Queen is back❤️
💕💕
Todo mundo falando de OA e eu aqui so lembrando de Da magia a sedução, Florence ta igualzinha a personagem da Nicole Kidman
Think Florence has watched one too many Kate bush videos, which by no way is a bad thing!
Love at first sight!!!
Florence Welch....well done...I'm a believer Not only did you save it...you brought creativity back where it belongs
This gives me asmr tingles 💜
Reminds me of Kate Bush. Not the voice but the theatrical performance.
stand by me
Suspiria tá diferente
Strong x
Essa mulher e tudo
Witch!
Free Ukraine Now ! Send aircrafts + EMP capacities (NNEMP)
Wow c'est tellement puissant! J'aime ton univers Florence tu me transportes à travers chacune de tes chansons!!! Vivement la sortie de ton album, j'ai tellement hâte 🤩
YAAAAAAAAAWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Damn, this is some quality cult material. :D Florence, just say the word and I am yours!
That was dope !!!!!!
reminds me of Galen Hooks
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
From the first time I saw the video it reminded me a lot of the OA, two of my favorite things together. I love it <3
On repeat 💙💚💛🧡❤
Chills
Love this.  Waiting to see you again at Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Melbourne,  Australia.  Safe travels.
I have no words, Florence you are a masterpiece ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The OA lives on
I don't know why I have these goosebumps but I love it!
this dance reminds me of the movements form the OA ;)
Florence + The machine tem uma voz poderosa 👏🏽❤️🇧🇷
Jesus Christ is real, and he loves you.
Oa?! Is that you?
Chills!
This is great. Kate Bush would be very proud.
Remind me of Which Witch!
Unbelievable. This is so powerful. I love everything you do, Florence. This is magic. You have literally breathed life into me with this song.
The OA!!!!!
I am crying cold to the bone in a warm apartment. Bravo
It looks like she's coming back with something brilliant.
This is giving me major Salem vibes. I love it 😍
Listen to this too Bu sesi de dinleyin çok içten söylüyor https://youtu.be/7cTYQazmaq0.
Finally some pandemic music I can relate to.
OA movements - love
Long we have waited, with expectation Long we have prayed with, anticipation  But suddenly there is a light in the darkness It's shining in Bethlehem  This is the moment This is the night Sing choir of angels, glory to God He's peace on the Earth He's joy to the world The Savior has come down And heaven is here  Behold the Redeemer, God of the ages Behold the Messiah, mighty to save us  Oh, everyone see there's a light in the darkness He's shining in Bethlehem  This is the moment This is the night Sing choir of angels, glory to God He's peace on the Earth He's joy to the world The Savior has come down  Oh, this is the moment This is the night Sing choir of angels, glory to God He's peace on the Earth He's joy to the world The Savior has come down  All glory, his honor be unto the King, unto the King We fall down, before Him, and worship the King, worship the King All glory, his honor be unto the King, unto the King We fall down, before Him, and worship the King  This is the moment This is the night Sing choir of angels, glory to God He's peace on the Earth He's joy to the world The Savior has come down  This is the moment This is the night Sing choir of angels, glory to God He's peace on the Earth He's joy to the world The Savior has come down  Heaven is here Heaven is here Heaven is here Heaven is here Heaven is here
Perfect 🤩
PHENOMENAL 😮❤️😍😍😍
I've seen some of "The OA" movements!
What disney witch is she
The OA vibes
finaly
Praying for Marina and Anastasia, praying for peace for Ukraine, praying for peace for whole world.
I began to love this song
This is magical :)
I sigilli sono stati rotti
Okay but I'm obsessed with these dancers as well and how they emote the song with her. I hope they're in more videos from this album.
Heaven Is here🙌🏻💃🏼🔥🎶
Florence is ART!!
😘🇨🇾🌎🌏🌍🗺️🌐❤️🌈🌌
I'm a huge fan of Florence but I think somebody needs to check her meds. This is like some manic episode in a mental ward.
Hallelujah sis 🙏🔥💗
the witch is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just adore her. Nothing else compares to what she brings to the world. Such a beautiful soul and her music evokes such colors and  feelings. Thank you Florence, for being you in a world that tries to make us all the same
The OA???
Some parts of the song kinda sound like the intro from reign.
wow this choreography is wild
This song makes me feel like I need to find a horrid man at the bar, entrap him, and gather my coven to sacrifice him to the goddess of the harvest. Idk, just a vibe. I’m not gonna do that… maybe…
The energy she will bring on stage with these drums and dances
Aaaaaaah <3
I am obsessed with this song already.
You are perfect your songs perfects ✨✨✨
This gave me chills. Florence is MAGIC.
She is so AMAZING!!)))))
Bem Loka como sempre, Amo )))
EPIC. . .she never dissapoints🔥❤🔥
je taime  comme tjr
Uhhhhh the dancer with the short blonde hair hello we need a solo moved to tears, want/need more
💚💛
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Florence and the machine should consider adding horror movie acting into her career
Wow 😮
WOW!!! Phenomenal!
This video is amazing
Sensacional  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
OMG! Ryan Heffington is the choreographer! That's why this is so weirdly stunning, I love it.BTW He choreographed the chandelier and OA Movements.
NO WAY
she is our king 💜✨
Simply amazing.
Wow so powerful and just how brilliant was this song, yes short but full of emmotion and feeling, I literally felt every single beat and word. Thank for this and I can't wait for the album to come out if this and King are anything to judge it by then it will be excellent. 🥰
Why do they record her breathing at the end? lol
Why is this song so short? Damnit!
I love you @florencemachine every song was my escape... So deep ... A true artist ♥️
OMG HELL YES. You Have outdone yourself
Definitely copied from the OA. The show should have never been cancelled!
This album is for the wiccans and the wiccans only
the dancers' expressions just make everything better
She is transcendental
GOT ME ON MY KNEES
beautiful choreography...  would better imagine on a meadow in forrest... would like to have such dress...  would like to dance with them...
Intense AF
Wow one of a kind ❤️ and what a performance 👏👏👏
Just got chills of excitement 💟
Okay but does anyone know where I can get the boots they're wearing? It is very important 2 me personally
Perfeição! ❤️
Essa dança me lembrou os cinco movimentos da série The OA 🥺❤👏🏻
Miss you so much, Flor
So powerful...
aleluia, arrepiei
The rain master🌎the energy of earth
OMG! Album of the year is coming
Wow
Que interpretação digna de prêmio
✨♥️
EU TE AMO MULHER. BEJOS DO BRASIL!
This is why we need to pass Old Heaven away. No need for the hanging to be. God is here. I would warn that God will come down and help.
unreal. bravo. wow.
loved this performance!
Ela está viva! ❤️❤️❤️
I have No Words, no matter what she  touches it turns into a masterpiece, Gold. It is cure for my soul, thank you.
Heaven Is Here Lyrics  [Verse 1] Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 2] Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 3] And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert  [Verse 4] More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going  [Bridge] And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man  [Outro] And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
Wow. The catholic taste of wine. In those gilded cups! And in her red dress, like she is the wine, that kills the men. So many alcoholics kill themselves with a gun when drunk. Any other interpretations that are food for thought? This is a masterpiece.
Gorgeous ❤😍
Y'all forget Lana did this like 10 yrs ago lol
Every morning I play this. 💯 ❤️
Holy. Fucking. Shit
yep I DO WANNA IT
Florence radiates black magic. Heaven is here y’all, make sure you know who’s out there taking from the angels & who is a walking praise to God. It’s a dangerous time to walk the line blindly.
Amazing as always from Florence.
eu queria muito que ela se juntasse com a AURORA , pqp seria mágico demais............
The witch vibes are intense... love it!  The raspberry colour of their knickers are haunting me and I'm seeking the colour out.  Like a bright flash of a parrot's wing in an all silver jungle... how does that fit in with the witch vibe? It doesn't, it's a shock and we love Florence for that, we love her fashion, her colours her vibes and her intensity. Pure art as always.
This song is terrible
i got goosebumps
YO! That's fucking filthy!!!
🌞
👁👄👁
what? what was that? wow!  i remember florence and the machine... u guys are great! subscribed.
This is the little sister of Big god.
If I should explain art:
Wow! She gives me chills everytime. She graced my face and head when we sung what kind of man for a few seconds together in Brooklyn. best night ever! :)
Oh this is so good 😊
Masterpiece ! 👌😇
くそだせえ相変わらず電話
I need friend​s to chant and dance to this around​ a bonfire with me.
EVERY SINGLE HAIR IN MY BODY IS STANDING UP. THIS IS JUST PERFECTION. EVERY SINGLE DETAIL OF THIS IS PERFECTION. SHE IS KING.
Beauté véritable.
Reminds me of Midsommar
WOAH
This is so raw I love that Florence is willing to be a bit more unfiltered.
Once again Florence Welch continues to be our generation's Bjork and Kate Bush. Out there, but spell-binding. I'm buying this album as soon as it drops!
i FEEl like i just join some Cult
Όσο πιο σκοτεινό, τόσο το καλύτερο.
I’ve loved Florence since 2009, and she just keeps giving and reinventing.
SHE NEVER MISSES
✴️
Eu amo essa vibe!! Boto os dois fones e sinto como se estivesse num filme...
Just saying WOW!!!
wow, in EVRY way yea
vintage
uma artista incrível ❤️
My mom said I shouldn't watch this music video. Idk why.
Loving
This kinda reminds to The OA
I am soooo happy to have new Florence to enjoy! So powerful, emotional, raw, yesss!
The King! 👑
Her coven must be so proud
Simply a Masterpiece 🙌🏽
Hated it at first hearing, liked it second, loved it at third.
This was so good I’m so sad that it’s so short😭
I NEED a collaboration with AURORA, it would be the best day of my life 😭
What in the Satanic witch ritual is this?!
THIS MV IS ABOUT? ??
The girls and I in between classes at our catholic school
Was just thinking about how I wanted new Florence music. Happy days 😊
Florence x Heffington 🤍
Wow I'm pretty sure I'll never stop listening to this or any of her other songs. You're a Goddess among goddesses
This give me Manon and the 13 vibes. God I love this woman. 👑
love how ancient and primal this is - reminds me of older, minimal, spiritual african, norse and mongolian music like Munknorr, Heilung, Olox, etc. ✨  Keep being amazing and lets flow love and passion and magic back into the world 🌌🌿
omg this is like a catharsis
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 FLORENCE!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 #HEAVENISHERE GOD BLESS 🙌🏾🙏🏾 💯🔥🎶🔥 🎶🔥💓🥇😁✊🏾
Terrifying in all the right ways.
Quero muitoooooooooooo um feat da Florence com a Aurora AAAAAAAAAA por favorrrrr aaaaa
True Virgo  queen/king
i'm forever mesmerized
More like hell is here, maybe since she’s rich she’s in heaven
Se ha vuelto monótona y aburrida
Very "the OA" vibes, I love it!
So powerful, my god. I'll watch it on loop
Êi! Por que essa música só tem 2 minutos? Agora vou ter que ouvir em loop infinito 😆
ª
I really love this vibes, FATM forever ♥
Você é perfeita! 💜
She is a force!!!! Brilliant!!
É a bruxa  Apenas
clamante fala sobre uma amarração ❤️‍🔥🔥
QUEEENNNNN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MISSED YOU, COME TO BRASIL LOVE U LOVE U LOVE UUUUUU
Ahhhhhhh
Mulher que perfeito
I'm totally not intrigued. Never heard of Florence + The Machine so checked this song out after a review by someone. After hearing this I know this is not for me.
Que pegada incrível que ela ta seguindo! Lindo demais!
This reminds me of midsummer. Cant remember the exact part of the movie but there's a quick drum then the rolling of the tongue. Time to re-watch it I guess. Love the new music.
the expressions on those dancers' faces!!! so wonderful <3
Grandaughter of all witches that they couldn't burn <3
This clip (Not the song) makes me imagine that it's the birth of a super vilain! When she gets to her max powers.
Im so in love with you
Uau
This song is everything. I’m having a hard time keeping myself together. ❤️🌻☮️
I think this is an interlude/entrance to a song that will be like a ceremonial/witchy song. Like they are prepparing their ritual. Let's bring the craft
Ok the outro I was like oh my god
Woah...cold chills
Florence, música etc uma experiência maravilhosa como sempre parece que estão contando uma história ao contrário... + the oa marcando presença, vlw coreógrafo, busco a Brit Marling a cada clipe novo kkkk/wwww
OA
Wow! This is an AMAZING work of art! ❤️❤️❤️
How is she SO good? 😩
Good evening we are from Ukraine !!!
Is Florence in a coven? If so, I wanna join.
I used to sing and dance in a traditional Russian choir and this song strangely reminded me of those wild days. I can't even describe what it is, Florence is creating her own form of art.
🇺🇦
Let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort they put into their content for us. Great job
This has SUCH The OA vibes I had to check if the coreographer is the same... and of course it is! So organic and haunting, love it
It's like Florence's making a haka using her womb as a tambourine. How powerful.
The album gonna be EPIC
Una bomba! 🧨😍
So sad to think that this video was recorded in Ukraine 😔
Poor Ukraine. It's so  sad to think that two of these dancers are sheltering in Ukraine. I hope they are safe.
I want more!!!! 😍
I am calling the priest...
Mommy?
so heaven is here!!!
Ummmm what's happening?
OMFG!, autumm + florece are the best combo ★
pure art. you do it ALL
Please read: [WAY OF HOPE & PEACE  John 3:16 For God so loved the world (all people), that he gave his only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believes in him should not perish (condemned to hell), but have everlasting life.  John 3:36 He that believes on the Son (Jesus Christ) has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.  John 14:6 Jesus said to him (us), I am the way, the truth, and the life (eternal life):  no man comes to the Father, but by me.  Eph. 2:8-9 For by Grace (from God) are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Rom. 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;]  We all should have the opportunity to know the way of salvation by repenting of our sins and putting our faith in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.
this is Clever eerie witchcraft?   very intriguing
dry Big God
Heavenly haunting. 😯 This is artistry.
She is fantastic live
It is now time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read the Bible
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
*DANCE FEVER* A fairytale in 14 songs.
Florence is an artist that I have been totally in full attention since her first album. She is capturing. A very Bright star. Her wisdom speaks levels of truth and compassion and love . Not to mention now.. woman/ goddesss empowerment. Thank you for Share the Cosmic Divine with us! Bravo! Just keeps getting better and better!
I'm delighted!!! King and it !!! Mega!!!!!! waiting for more!!!!
Idk how many times I've watched this but I don't see an end in sight
Heaven is a place God resides in, its Gods home. For heaven to be within would have to stem from a good spiritual mindset.
Let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort they put into their content for us. Great job
Terrifying
I expected a king vibe but I keep discovering everything she wants to convey in her lyrics and verses ✨🖤
Florence... WOW! Amazing work <3
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄💩💩💩💩💩
Happy Women's Month! 💜
Simply surpurb 👏 my favourite choreography to date 🥰
It reminds me of OA  the tv show!!
02/24/22 Russia started a war against Ukraine. Russian troops act like terrorists. They kill women, children, destroy cities. The whole world must unite against these terrorists. The whole world should ignore goods and companies that are related to Russia. #BoycottRussia
Lyrics ✨🔥✨ [Verse 1] Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 2] Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 3] And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert  [Verse 4] More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going  [Bridge] And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man  [Outro] And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaveny
art.
Yes.
e che te lo dico a fare!
I dont like the agressive moves in the clip but i appreciate the creative Soul it possesses
Wow Flo ^^
And we are allowed to watch this amazing art for free? WOW! What a time to be alive.
Literally shaking from excitement
que medo
Incredible! sz
in the description it says that two of them are sheltering. sorry but what does sheltering mean here? like in a bomb shelter, homeless shelter, etc?
How beautiful! love from Ukraine🇺🇦
I missed her ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
The OA
Heaven is here if you want it. Hell is here too, no matter what you do.
Verse 1] Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 2] Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 3] And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert  [Verse 4] More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going  [Bridge] And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man  [Outro] And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
this is so fucking good ive loved florence since shake it out & hunger!!! i revisited shake it out the other day, but it broke my heart seeing barely anyone looking like me. as beautiful and feral as her previous work - and it makes me even happier to see beautiful and feral people who look like me (-: thank you florence, love you
This video is artistic and compelling, as are the lyrics. The music and vocal phrasing was unpleasant, however. Suspiria vibes.
This video reminds me of the movie: Suspiria. Great movie btw
This looks like a scene that belongs in a full length musical. Wonderful.
This female is weird 😕
You females are lost
Draw me a circle and I will protect, Heaven is here if you want it! 💫
Crying. Screaming. Throwing up.
Initial reaction. Holy shit.
Ma'am this is a Wendy's
Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OA?
ALL HAIL THE QUEEN, SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN 🙏🙌💙👑
i love the usage of religious symbols and imagery in her songs despite florence not being aligned with christianity- she always finds such intricate ways to use symbols and interpret them for her genius lyrics. so pumped for an album 😭💖
Awesome
Well if this isn't clearly satanic.
Who cares? Doja cat is cooler than whatever the fuck this is.
So Good!!! 👏👏👏
I really want to be one of the backup dancers, but I feel like Id mess up every bit by stepping on my own dress 😂
I want more!!!
Train wreck, yo, train wreck!
Sei que poucos vão ler essa mensagem, mas JESUS TE AMA🎈💖🙏
Nice.
Florence, Lorde and Lana Del Rey should have a song together! OMG!!
no idea but i want the dresses so bad
Anyone else get some strong OA vibes from that dance!? (side note, bring back the OA..) Incredible song and video!
Beautiful 💜
.
teamo Florence, gracias por tremendo arte
Do you...???...
I'm sure this one was pretty shit. 🤷
WASN'T THE LAST WOMAN TO BE HANGED IN THIS COUNTRY IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK?
💜🔥
Bruxa poderosa. Amo.
This is what is so great about the her art, It means something different to everyone but in the end it leaves us all enthralled and wanting more.
captivating
I love how their clothing seems more like instruments than shields or shrouds. Yknow? Like they're not trying to hide themselves like wearing clothing is usually for. Their skirts are like fans and swords swung around.
The fuck is this shit?
The OA sempre vive nas almas de quem sentiu a serie.
I am never joining cult.
Conceito atras de conceito
HEAVEN? THAT'S satanic PERIOD!
I hear when doves cry by prince 🧐🙄
The OA sent me.
Ummm... needs a hug?
florence welch is a genius
Kind of reminds me of the Drumming Song video!!!!!
just love this
I'm so very in love with this woman. Everything she does is pure magic !

Florence and aurora my 2 soul grabbing artist🤗🤗🤗I've been longing for Florence's new music,  now its here ,.... .I can exhale😌
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
This.... Is art
The OA?
Oh my goddess
Tá repreendido. Sou evangélico.
0:17 That move is straight out of The OA
Wonder if Kate Bush likes this stuff. Made me think of her. ✌️🤔
Q perfeito
Um grito pela sobrevivência! Arte pura! <3
Meu Deus! Isso é respirar arte! Florence é um bálsamo para o mundo! <3 Amo demais! <3
The movements, the beat, the added noises and sounds, it’s poetic and beautiful 😱🤩
Really shitty shit.
She's nuts like jz
A 147ª Reunião e Exposição Anual da Associação Americana de Saúde Pública (APHA) realizou-se no Centro de Conferências da Pensilvânia em Filadélfia, de 2 a 6 de novembro de 2019.  Durante a reunião de 12 mil profissionais de saúde pública mais influentes do mundo, muitos tomaram conhecimento da matança extrajudicial em larga escala pelo regime comunista chinês de prisioneiros de consciência e adeptos religiosos para transplantes de órgãos.    A extração forçada de órgãos de pessoas vivas sancionada pelo PCC chamou a atenção durante a Reunião Anual da APHA de 2019  Fundada em 1872, a APHA é a organização de saúde pública mais antiga e com a maior diversidade acadêmica do mundo. Na reunião e exposição de 2019 participaram representantes de governos, universidades, institutos de pesquisa, organizações, hospitais e prestadores de cuidados de saúde de todo o mundo. Houve também um grande número de participantes da China e de estudantes no exterior.  O China Organ Harvest Research Center (COHRC), sediado em Nova York, participou da reunião pela terceira vez com apresentações orais e pôsteres. O COHRC revelou uma das mais hediondas catástrofes de direitos humanos do século XXI, o que alarmou os participantes.  Ao contrário do tráfico de órgãos do mercado negro em alguns países, os transplantes forçados de órgãos de prisioneiros de consciência vivos sob demanda pelo Partido Comunista Chinês (PCC), são sancionados pelo governo chinês e operados pelas instituições militares e locais.  O COHRC expôs a extração forçada de órgãos vivos do PCC durante o 27º Congresso Internacional da Sociedade de Transplantes (TTS) na Espanha, em julho de 2018, no Congresso Americano de Transplantes (ATC) em junho de 2019 e no 19º Congresso da Sociedade Europeia de Transplantes de Órgãos, na Dinamarca, em setembro de 2019. No final de outubro, o COHRC foi convidado para a reunião anual da Sociedade Americana de Bioética e Humanidade (ASBH). O COHRC compartilhou seus resultados de investigação mais recentes com apresentações especiais sobre a natureza, escala, fonte de órgãos, fatores determinantes e impacto da extração forçada de órgãos na China.
Creepy and awesome at the same time.
Perfeito <3 ainda mais com essa coreografia que faz referencia a The OA.
this song better be used in the next season of Yellowjackets
I can't stop watching this. It's marvellous.
Muié na Net kkkkkkkkkkkkk

Getting Sevdaliza vibes. I like it
Florence never disappoints, she delivers. Happy to see that the queen is back.
Powerful . Breathtaking!
she is a cult lider and i wanna join her coven!
💛 last night was very tough for me. I was disappointed & stressed. Desperate. Was caused to be annoyed yesterday. I was dragged to have a late night tho i was so tired, really wanted to go sleep but working on personal things and thinking so hard. Hardly ate that day.. Couldn’t sleep well i was so dehydrated and my head worn. So woke up rough. (I take care of my health though, eat enough & know what i can handle). Recovered from last night’s exhaustion quickly though, must of been the brightness Florence gave me with this song. But i went to sleep hopeful. Proud of myself & support i’ve given such as donations. And happy as I felt love last night for which I hadn’t quite in a long time, i saw Zelinsky just before going to sleep which was sweet 😊 i had only discovered him recently since the war started. Had never known him before. That’s how much Ukraine were clearly not prevocational nor miss behaving at all. They weren’t even seeking any attention. So what reason would there be to hate them, doesn’t make any sense, there’s nothing. Though worried about Zelinsky and no one needed that nor ask nor require that from him, i’d much rather he kept safe but i was grateful, it was nice & honest of him to not cowardly hide & we know that he doesn’t just make others do his work for him, he actually is teamworkingly & respectfully with them. I wish he would be safe now though as that’s been enough proving he’d risk his life for his country’s people & the world. Then this morning i woke up to finding myself at random this lovely song by Florence’s team. Thank you for the dances. Good powers & heavens i assume, answered those hopes i had of the spiritual dances, was thinking of them. The ancient Native Americans spirits would be grateful to Florence. As they cared for nature and were anti war and loved their family 🥲. This song & vid so nice. & seeing Zelinsky too & the love. (I’ve now found out he’s not single, didn’t know 😌never mind aha 😅 that’s ok 😊 i was starting to like another person before like a yr ago anyway but i’ve just had to be apart from them unfortunately because i got ill 😔 & like literally lost them like didn’t ask for their contact info, so that hardly started but had a good feeling about them, so i was making sure i’m recovered for that to have a fair chance hopefully) i love the Lion/cat purring in the song too. 💛.
Capa clipe é uma obra de arte, seja pela letra, a música em si ou pelo cenário. A MAIOR 💙
Omg, Florence doing the five movements The OA LOL
I'm LIVING for this Florence era 😭❤️
She’s truely a which
Jesus, it's better you know him before you meet him.
Wow
I don’t know how she does it. Every album has a new sound that sounds like she’s singing about what I’m going through. I will forever love Florence 😭😭
How do I sign up to join this Coven?
THE MOVEMENTS!!! Florence are you jumping into the invisible stream to heaven? x. #OA
Divina!
Yo! All this new stuff she’s got is CRAZY GOOD! I’m so aimed for this ALBUM 💿😱💿
Powerful
This is clearly beyond the perception of this world, a lyrically performed scream from another realm.
M A R A V I L L A ♥️ 💯
Filmed in Kyiv, Ukraine. Few months ago.  Just wonderful.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it  Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert  More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going  And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man
Illuminati Florence at it again I see!!!
ryan just decided to upcicle theoa choreography
Mais uma obra-prima dessa magnífica cantora, intérprete; simplesmente sensacional 👏🇧🇷❤
I'm a fan of Florence and the machine seen her times. Have the albums etc...but I have no idea what to make of this song. I don't like it and I don't hate it either.
ESTO ES THEOAAA
Crazy how this song was released the day my step dad left us, we're gonna miss you Mr Storm. Heaven is here for you, and in heaven we'll find you again. Thank you Florence for sharing your beauty with us all right when we all need it <3 The process of grief, anger, raw emotions is so strong and relevant. The power to overcome sorrow and bad habits. The anger that a rare disease took someone important away, powerlessness knowing there's nothing that could've been done. On top of the intense energy of the conflicts going on in Ukraine. We're all in this together in our own ways. Love all, serve all.

I had to come back again and tell you how f****** horrible this is! I've been following music for years and this isn't anywhere near anything that is TALENT.
Florence channelling her inner Midsommar 🙌
phenomenal. cheers to support for ukraine 💙💛
Very high quality work! How many Ukrainians/hour do you think die under bombs and rockets? #СloseТheSky

New single🙇 https://youtu.be/LEteAi6v5Dw
Florence is our counterpoint to Illuminati Music Video Rituals
New single https://youtu.be/LEteAi6v5Dw
I 😘 ved it so powerful
I saw Florence live in a music festival here in my country and it was one of the most transcendental experiences of my life. Everyone was absolutely enchanted, it felt like we were all collectively praying, or worshipping a very old deity. She has a beautiful way of making you feel connected to something bigger than you, and the music was bigger than all of us. It was like the music itself was enchanted. She's become my absolute favourite since. So powerful, even in a festival concert, where you have so many different audiences. And she won every one of us over. Watching this video, I felt like that all over again.
Beautiful
Brutal, brave and bold!!! Florence presenting our fear in our face and helping us dealing with it!!!
Florence is a true performer💖
Dankoni vin, tre informa video.Mi ĝojos se ankaŭ vi venos al mia kanalo.
Suena a intro de un disco que va a tener mucha fuerza. COMO LA ADORO!!!!!!
Я подготовил перевод и моё понимание этой песни.   Oh bring your salt, bring your cigarette,  О, неси свою соль, неси свою сигарету,  Draw me a circle and I’ll protect.  Нарисуй мне круг и я буду защищать Heaven is here if you want it!  Небеса здесь, если ты так захотел!   Oh bring your boy, bring your bottle,  О, неси своего мальчика, неси свою бутыль,  Open your mouth pour it down his neck.  Открой свой рот, залей это ему в горло.  Heaven is here if you want it!  Небеса здесь, если ты так захотел!   And all of the fish, let them flounder.  И вся эта рыба, пусть барахтается.  I went to the water drank every drop.  Я подошла к воде, выпила каждую каплю.  I’ll turn your sea to a desert!  Я обращу твоё море в пустыню!   More catholic taste than the devil.  Больше католического вкуса, чем дьявольского.  All gilded and golden yes I’m your girl.  Вся позолочена и золот'а, да, я твоя девушка.  Hell if it glitters I’m going  Черт возьми, если он блестит, я выдвигаюсь!   And I ride.  И я еду.  In my red dress В моём красном платье.  And time stretches endless.  И время растягивается на бесконечность.  With my gun in my hand  С моим пистолетом в руке You know I always get my Man.   Ты же знаешь, я всегда получаю своего Мужчину.   And every song I wrote И каждая песня, что я написала,  Became an escape rope Стала спасательным тросом,  Tied around my neck Обвязанным вокруг моей шеи To pull me up to heaven Чтобы поднять меня к небу.   Флоренс приказывает принести ей ингридиенты.  Солью очерчивали круг для защиты от нечистых сил.  Сигареты использовались в оккультных спиритических сеансах, ритуалах медиумов ряда культов для призыва.  К небесам обращались как к эпицентру высших сил и призывали их в себя, полностью пропуская через себя божественные энергии и являя подлинной безжалостно храброе лицо Мага, Бога, чтобы решить нерешаемое, вылечить неизлечимое.  Для того, чтобы  Она приказывает принести пациента,  говорит открыть ему рот, и своим помощницам залить ему в горло подготовленное для таких случаев зелье из бутыли.   Ты хочешь выжить - что ж - я стану Небесами, чтобы вытащить тебя с краю смертоносной бездны.   Она готовится забрать весь яд из тела, забрать его всего из тела.  Она объясняет тебе будет так плохо, что тебе покажется, что все твои моря высохли, настанет жажда такая, что ты ощутишь, как барахтается замертво вся рыба моря на сжигающем всё солнце.   Маг бесстрашен перед Дьяволом, потому всё, что не убивает, имеет католический вкус святости.  Флоренс утверждает, что она золото, спасение, которое сияет отовсюду, и, если она видит блеск и надежду, она готова хватать как бесстрашная девушка готова сражаться за сердце и жизнь её единственно влюблённого.   И при неудачи спасти, она готова застрелиться, чтобы получить своего мужчину, быть с ним, слиться с ним за гранью жизни, найти его и переродиться.   Верёвку на шее использовали опускаясь в мир мёртвых как связь с миром, последний шанс вернуться.  Флоренс укореняет себя в мир жизни спасательными верёвками, как если бы всё было наоборот, и Царство Жизни поменялось местами с Царством Мёртвых.  Я вырос на эзотерических оккультных ритуальных книгах и магической заклинательной поэзии, мне известны эти процессы.  Флоренс демонстрирует:  Как целитель она готова пойти на всё.
anyone else think of the song ‘scotland’ by the lumineers at 1:00? because I do and I love it ❤️
👍🏻 🇲🇦 👉🏻👌🏻https://youtu.be/oDoTHGjI9IE 💜🌷
FLORENCE DEUSA, RAINHA <3 Obrigada demais por existir e fazer arte de uma forma tão potente.
Te amo Florence and the machine siempre dando arte ❤️
Fucking glorious
WELCOME TO HEAVEN THANKS FOR YOUR MUSIC I LISTEN AWHILE  TO YOUR AMAZING MUSIC...
La última frase me encantó, sus canciones son su conexión directa con el cielo, es por eso que si escucharla (por lo menos yo) siento un ambiente muy distinto y espiritual.
Florence siempre consigue darnos canciones con las cuales no podamos identificar y empoderar
Esto me recuerda a cuando Florence contó que en la secundaria tenía su propio "coven" de brujas, dónde solamente se dedicaba a escribir supuestos hechizos en una libreta y a recitarlos y hacerlos junto a sus amigas, era más juego de niños. No me sorpenderia que Florence se inspira en estás vivencias de la adolescencia, lo cual de la a la canción ese toque de intimidad y conexión.
The chills I got from this song. I love her and her music so much.
The OA?????? #SaveTheOA
This is going to be equal parts terrifying and electric live.
Incredible! :)
TheOA movements brought me here 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Wow nice
No one is going to mention the obvious shout out to The OA with those movements? So glad to know Florence is one of us.
Vibe of "Virgin Queen" Elizabeth I
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
What cult is this??
This video reminds me of a comment from her Big God video where somebody said that they love it when women go absolutely feral and batshit and I think Florence and the director took that to heart
*screams* WEEEE FLORENCE RELEASED ANOTHER SONG
Demons!
mulheeeeer, que música boa!!!!! <3
Thank you my King(queen)
Maravilhosa
GODDESS
Omg it's The Movements from The OA 😲😲
Omg ♥️🔥
Those movements reminded me of the OA 😍 guess it’s time for a rewatch 🥰
She seems like a handful,  where are the white males ?
#TheyWereHerProperty
Gente... eu estava tentando entender que tipo de bruxaria era essa kkkkkkk mas achei meio pesado o feitiço do final
This reminds of the song that the women sing around the fire in "Portrait of A Lady on Fire", needless to say I love it!
vem com tudo, rainha king!
Major "I saw Goody Proctor with the devil" vibes here! Incredible!
Meu deus vc é incrível!!!

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Florence é perfeita ❤️
Q PORQUERIA ES ESTA!!!
Annie has really grown up.
This will transcend time
You are magical
me arrepiei
Love seeing those scurrying feet. Very cool dance mm one of a kind for sure
this choreography is immaculate
great and powefull! love from 💙💛
Eu gravo covers para o YouTube e convido vcs a assistirem  💙
parabens
Phenomenal! No words can truly describe this wonderful master piece <3
Omg, Heffington, he is a genious, but it's a little boring after 8 years of watching same thing over and over.
gooooseee bumpss!
Gorgeous
This is well done! I like it; good beat as well Thank you!
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
TWO BACK TO BACK?! AND SO SOON?! consider me spoiled baybeeee lolll. but no, seriously thank you so much. 1 single would have sustained me for-literally-ever. Appreciate all that you give and do, Florence <3
Okay I love her
Goosebumps 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 The choreography and the gritty angst as she sings her heart out. Florence is the 👑
WOW!
Florence has literally made the best soundtrack to Elden ring
Demonic possession anyone ? Nah
Your hypocrisy is mind blowing. Can't your sheltering sisters identify out of war and bombing? How come, Florence? Self ID works only for the benefit of those who make war. Wake the fuck up!
Wtf is this doing in my feed? 🤣
Goosebumps! This is incredible to witness.
i love that the movements from the OA are in this song. the OA was a really powerful story, i think it helped alot of people in a lot of different ways. it’s disappointing they stopped producing the show considering how well it was going for netflix and the producers. and it clearly had a beautiful impact, maybe that’s why they stopped producing it.
This video is so "florence" i have no other way to describe it!! I love it!!
Once again I'd like to thank team Florence for a great job done all the admins dancers and cameramen.and all involved.☪️🔚
Who else feels extra powerful after listening to this? Work of Art Florence 🔥♥️
Thanks Florence. You are a sunshine
No, I don't think you understand...   I'm obsessed.
A melhor ❤️
te amo mulherrrrrr
So cool
Power
A better video than song.
Demonic witches.
wait why is she wearing Shoes?? Flo are you ok ??
🇺🇦♥️
Major OA vibes.
If the world ends after this new album is released, I have no regret at all.
🙌🏻❤
This choregraphy is crazy good. Feel like i dont know catholism enough to understand everything however, what are their views on alcohol?  "heaven is here if you want it" -followed by stabbing to the stomach/uterus is quite something though.
Artist. Que agonia o negocim no pescoço dela haha
amazing!  hail to the queen
This is pure magic.
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Potencia.
This is so goood. Thissong made me so excited about what s to come!❤️
The OA!
Time for Florence to stop playing and drop that new TV series where she's this powerful spiritual entity who's trying to change the world.
Goosebumps ❤‍🔥
She has never sold out to who she was for any amount. She is still who she always was. Love the bones of her. Makes me feel ways no music ever has.
❤❤❤❤
I love Flo, but these last 2 songs seem like more performance pieces or trailers for movies that should be made then actually good songs on their own.
Reminds me of Big God energy.  This is brilliant, love her💛
Everything still alright?
beaut
Wow
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before. I clicked on this accidentally and I was immediately drawn in. You seem like an artist that wants to convey their thoughts and feelings sincerely. Astounding
✨My cult, my religion, my sorceress Suprime and King: Florence Welch🖤✨
I feel privileged to live on Earth at the same time as her
Oh love it ♥️
24yrs ago there was a little red headed girl who sang all day.she banged on walls sung in lifts .24yrs later that girl is taking the world by storm that girls name is Florence welch
Even though this isn’t my sort of music, Florence is just SOO fantastic! SOO unique! And I hope she never changes! 🔥
😭💖👏👏👏👏👏👏
Okay, im ready for the album
Yeah when people talk about witchcraft this is what they refer to. I mean look at this lady...  Don't emulate this person, this is an example of what not to do.
so damn powerful!!
Filmed in Kyiv, Ukraine (20 Nov 2021).
Weird
The spoke part at the end, it feels like the thematic inverse of Sky Full of Song and I love that duality. Because creating is like that…
Wow ... this is SO powerful and emotional. By the end I was crying and had goosebumps all over 😲 This is a masterpiece ♥  Also a shoutout to the dancers. They are doing an amazing job!
But no! You won’t wait!’ Hunter slowly said, standing up to full height. ‘And they won’t wait! New species you say? Evolution? Inevitable extinction? Dung? Pigs? Vitamins? I’m not there yet. I’m not afraid of it either. Got it? I am not putting my hand up to volunteer. The instinct of self-preservation? You call it that. Yes, I will sink my teeth into life. Fuck your evolution. Let other species wait their turn. I’m not a lamb being led to slaughter. Capitulate and go off with your more perfect and more adapted beings – give them your place in history! If you feel that you’ve fought all you can fight, then go ahead and desert, I won’t judge you. But don’t try to scare me. And don’t try to drag me along with you into the slaughterhouse. Why are you giving me a sermon? If you don’t do it alone, if you need to do it collectively, you won’t be so ashamed? Or has the enemy promised you a bowl of hot porridge for each person that you bring to them in captivity? My fight is hopeless? You say that we’re at the edge of the abyss? I spit on your abyss. If you think that your place is at the bottom of the abyss then take a deep breath and forward march. But I’m not coming for the ride. If rational man, refined and civilised Homo sapiens chooses to capitulate – then I refuse to be called one and would rather become a beast. And I will, like a beast, sink my teeth into life and gnaw on the throats of others in order to survive. And I will survive. Got it?! I will survive!’
I wish this video had captions
I quite liked the dance sequence at 44 seconds that all I have to say
Amazing!
florence com música de 2 minutos? hmm isso tem cara de interlude  já quero o álbum ❤️❤️❤️
OMG THIS WAS AMAZING!! NOT GOING TO SAY THE B WORD BUT SHE WAS INVOKED BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS WAS A FLORENCE PERFORMANCE ALL HER OWN!
Heaven is Here es tan HBHBHB. El nuevo disco viene con todo. La espera valió la pena, como siempre, nos trae cosas tan perfectas y dignas de ella. La amooooooo.
I'm confused, is she happy or suicidal
This was scary
Hail the king.
Once again she nails it.grear goreograph.
ARTISTA EU DISSE ARTISTAAAA MEU DEUS FLORENCE EU TE AMO

The artistry of this short!!! The ending...beyond.

Absolutely stunning
Not going to lie. I had to grow to like this band. It took me a few listen before I started to like them.
CINEMA
¡NO MAMES! 💜
So beautiful. The dancers are amazing!
the OA...always a havenly message
Been a fan since breath of life and Damn, never failed to impress
The the beautiful choreography—some the same as The OA. (Netflix)
Pura ENERGÍA esta GRAN ARTISTA 🔥👌🏼🤩🇲🇽
Ring around the roseys
I broke your machine
I HAVE NO WORDS... i am speechless! soooo excited and hardly in the slightest bit prepared to see what else she has in store for us after these two BEAUTIFUL singles
it sounds like a A24 movie score, and i luv it
petition to get florence to do the main theme/background to the Scarlet Witch/ Wanda Maximoff movie
I love this song but it should last 10 min at least. I need moreeeeee
🤯🤯🤯
Suspiria vibes

MEU DEUS FLORENCE COMO VOCE OUSA A FAZER UMA PEFEIÇÃO DESSAS MAS TÃO CURTINHA?????
THANK YOU FLORENCE THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Goosebumps to see her talent and abilities. Indeed there are severely insufficient love for Florence, Madonna, Katy, Lana and Regina. My top 5 forever! 😍
You did it again!  Such an artist!
I don't know If I'm right but the mv Reminds me of "Queendom" from my favourite singer Aurora...
**Can't sleep at night?? Try the calming sounds of rain or ocean waves in one of my videos to drift you away** https://youtu.be/Lat4o_02J7M

Que surreal isso aqui. Cadê o álbum?🧡😭
Aaaaaagh I've missed the ethereal drumming so much 😭😭😭 thank you!!!
Uhhhm yupppp amazing again as always.... The video got me real good with the performance
Wow. This choreography is stunning!
Ye vipers; Ye generation of hypocrites!  Slither off and flee and such; And shiver at the angels touch. Ye Vipers, snipers, haters, too: Hypocrites be less than few....  Fork tongued ways at an end; Now the vipers find no friend. Them hypocritic oaths no more, Shall never now, come to fore.  2 Esdras [41] For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.  [42] For thouhast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm.  [43] Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty.  "And The Most High God of Israel, The Lord of Hosts and King of Jacob, shall send The Mighty One of Israel, The Word of Life, The Son of Man,'Eisa bin Maryam, and prowling as The Lion of Judah, He shall Come as A Thief in The Night, seeking out the Antichrist / Deceiver the Dajjal and bring about the end of days, and the beginning of eternity.   Allah will send 'Eisa bin Maryam, who will come down at the white minaret in the east of Damascus, wearing two Mahrud[garment dyed with Wars and then Saffron], resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, beads of perspiration will fall from it. Every disbeliever who smells the fragrance of his breath will die, and his breath will reach as far as his eye can see. Then he will set out and catch up with him (the Dajjal) at the gate of Ludd, and will kill him. Then the Prophet of Allah 'Eisa will come to some people whom Allah has protected, and he will wipe their faces and tell them of their status in Paradise.   Hadith No: 4055 From: Sunan Ibn Majah. Chapter 39, The Chapters on Tribulations Narrated/Authority of Hudhaifah bin Asid, Abu Sarihah  https://ahadith.co.uk/searchresults.php?page=3&q=Ad+dajjal
Daughter of Women.  From the Book of Daniel.  Old Testament  Though you were corrupted by the King of the North and whatever the god of forces, this new god, of which our forefathers new not. That he shall strengthen with precious stones, gold and silver. An unknown and new thing that is not of our learning, understanding or order.   Return yourself to the things of heaven that are not a hell. As described by the Archangel Gabriel in the Hadiths given unto our Muslim brothers and sisters and descendents of Ishmael son of Abraham from Hagar the Egyptian servant who met our Father at the well, proclaiming, "Behold the God who sees me" like unto no other God she had ever known, Selah.    Make way the ready for the coming of The Lord, make ready the way for the coming of The Lord, The Most High God of Israel, The Lord of Hosts and The King of Jacob.   As Daniel described, "She shall not stand for them" but returns to the rightful place with The One True God and Father, as should be the case for His   "Daughter of Women"  Your ministry awaits and Your place with God that is yours and yours alone. That the Holy One of Israel, The Son of Man and Our Father, wait for you, is no understatement. And so does the Kingdom of Heaven, The Kingdom of the Living God who holds Eternity in His hand and heart for us all.  Behold, "The Daughter of Women"  And may she have much baggage, learning, wisdom and love, ready to minister unto so very many like her yet more vulnerable and persecuted, manipulated, controlled and victimised as this world does to so many.  She gotta be loved and so do us all. Inshallah, Deo Volente Forever Amen   https://youtu.be/PJuzjekLbOw
I love you so much
QUEEN
First time they have been put on my feed. I’m very curious why.. but I love it!!!
She is in a league of her own. I know she is a Virgo with Moon in Gemini but her Ascendant must be either Leo or Aries. So passionate and theatrical.
So raw!! Beautiful!
Parece un huapango
The artistry is insane
Seriously the more and more I see of her work. The more I love what she delivers, it's amazing. Honest, raw, and powerful.
The choreo reminds me of The OA
Hits like before I even listen ❤
Sos todo lo que está bien Florence 💜  Talento de sobra
The hell this is amazing .
This is amazing diarrhea made by diarrhea people and loved by diarrhea people that love diarrhea.
Florence Welch is a divine creature.
I work at Dollar Tree and when I see customers that have masks on I will purposely over charge them items and smash their food without their knowledge. HAAHAHAHAAAAHAAAHAAHAAAHAHAHAHAAHAAAHAHA
This is art
Way WAYYYYYY more intense than the last album so I’m QUITE content I’ll definitely be looking forward to all this LIVE 💜🤘💋
The Celtic Warrior is Here
Inevitable decir al final "wow!"
ok
She's not lying, this is yall heaven. My Lord sits at the right hand of God the Father in the real heaven. I know who you worship this is a wicked world.
Asi es Heaven is here👇
🤍🤍🤍
florence voce esta necessitada? manda a chave do pix para seus fãs pagarem um cenario diferente pros clipes nao serem igual ao anterior, um beijo S2
What the f was this! Some sort of girl power!? slavery, 18/19 century American south, slash women dealing with injustice constantly..... I demand an explanation.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Una maravilla de artista 👏🏻
She’s really diving into the dark side 😭
Hey guys, the Water is back.
What's with the slamming of the stomach
I'm really liking this new stuff.
This is insane🔥🔥🔥
mulher esse refrão final arrepiou até o cabelo do meu cy
Artistry as it’s finest. Brava!
Came to the comments to see what the lyrics were and I’m the only English guy here. So I’m assuming this song is not English
😍❤
Heaven ain't here lol. But it is a real place. Where will yall spend eternity? Heaven is where you wanna be forever!  God loves you all wherever youre at 🙂 💙
Florence never disappoints, love the midsommer vibes
HEAVEN IS HEREEEEEEEEEEEE
this album is going to be so fucking powerful, I’m so ready.

Netta’s Toy ringing in my immortal drunk mind at periodic times in this masterpiece 🥰
OLHEI PRA ELA E FALEI ARTIIISTAAAA!!!
That’s Witchcraft 🌙✨
Que mujer por dios espectacular la amo
This part really hit me:  And еvery Song I Wrote Became An Escape Rope Tied Around My Neck To Pull Me Up To Heaven
voce entrega tudo o que sempre queremos, nunca erra!!!
eu não consigo sair desse video
This is so good and intense!
Para vocês que estão lendo isso. Deus os abençoe, e que seus sonhos se tornem realidade, fiquem seguros e tenham um dia maravilhoso!!! ✨🇧🇷🥀❤
This reminds me of a specific Imogen heap song which is not what I was expecting to think of lol
The artistry, emotion and grace.....she is the element to come xxxx
Beautiful and feral, in the best way ⚡️ I cannot wait to see this performed live!
Wow muy bueno, excelente she’s so awesome 👏
Time is up, and HEAVEN IS HERE! ✨ te amo Florence, cada canción es una obra maestra! Esta nueva era va a ser gloriosa!! 🫀🗡❤🏹😍
You come find me. -OA
This was filmed in Kyiv. My heart is with Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️
Lovely
Florence is a fucking G
ok is it just me or does the vocalization around 0:57 sound like the song scotland by the lumineers
Florence QUEEN OF ART AND LOVE! What a fucking ART trip! Damn that was so BEAUTIFUL!
The OA!!!!!!
Arte uwu
We've got a big God...y'all ready? May we repent of our sin and turn to God...for the Kingdom of Heaven is here. Amen.
My favorite thing about her is that while the world is changing and things are modernizing constantly, she holds true to herself and her style of music. I love her so much!
Someone wrote on the What the Water Gave Me video that she must be either mad or a genius. This song and performance finally convinced me that she is both - in the most lyrical, creative and beautiful sense. Love this band! Love all the artists that contributed to this piece of art! And, obviously, love Florence! ❤️
It REALLY is
When you see a building, you know there is an builder. When you see a painting, you know there is a painter although the builder or the painter may of died hundreds of years ago. So when you see creation, you know there is a creator, and that creator is God. In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. To not believe in God is to believe that nothing created something, that is impossible for nothing to create something. Say if there was an explosion that created or cause everything, where did the elements come from that exploded. See it is a never ending cycle, the only truth is to affirm that God has no beginning and no end and he created all things. The creator is greater than his creation. So we can not put him on the same level as a man. All men have a beginning, but God had no beginning no end because he is not a created being.  God is one being 3 distinct persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Each person is fully God, all co eternal and co equal. The Father is not the Son and the Son is not the Holy Spirit. They are distinct.  Jesus is the second person of the Godhead the Son of God. The Father sent the Son ( Jesus ) to be born by the power of the Holy Spirit through a virgin named Mary. He was miraculously born. He is one person with 2 natures. Fully God and fully man. Jesus submitted himself to the Father in his humanity and lived a perfect life he was obedient until death on a cross. This is the legal implications of the cross, the 10 commandments is God's moral law and Gods standard is moral perfection. Here is some of them: You shall not lie,  You shall not steal, You shall not commit adultery ( Jesus said whoever looks at a woman to lust has committed adultery with her in his heart, the same goes for a woman lusting after a man, And you shall not murder ( whoever is angry with someone is a murderer at heart), You shall have no gods before me ( This is to make up a God to suit yourself ) Do not take the name of the Lord Your God in vain ( Things like saying OMG and using God's name as meaningless or replacing a four letter filth word with God's name or Jesus Christ. To violate just one commandment is to be guilty of breaking the whole law. The wages of sin is death and punishment in hell which is God's prison. The punishment is eternal because God is eternal, We broke God's law and Jesus paid our fine. If you are in court and have a stack of speeding tickets and somebody pays your fine the Judge can let you go free even though you are guilty. That is what Jesus did for us on the cross. He gave his life so that sinners maybe reconciled to God and be free of the coming Judgment. He paid our wages our fine. It is appointed once to die and after this comes the Judgment. That is why Jesus last words on the cross was IT IS FINISHED! He finished paying the debt. He was buried and rose from the grave on the 3rd day defeating death proving he was who he claimed to be. God is so good he must punish sin, we will have to pay for our own sin if we reject the only person who took God's wrath for sin. There is no other name under heaven in which we might be saved. In order to be saved from God's wrath we need to repent ( turn from sin) and trust in Jesus alone not our own goodness. We can not be good because we have already broken God's law that requires perfect obedience. Jesus kept the law for us, when we repent and trust in him. His perfect life gets credited to our account, so when God the Father looks at us he sees you as perfect and righteous. (Please consider this) Suppose a murder rapes a woman and slits her throat but stands before the judge and says I help older women cross the street and give to the poor, a just Judge would say I am not judging based on the works you perform but judging you based on the crimes that you have committed. In the same way good works can not save us. God is rich in mercy for all who call upon him. Turn from your sin and trust in Jesus Christ alone and you will inherit the Kingdom of God and live forever
Florence really said let’s travel dimensions #theoa
Let’s go OAAAAAAA
te amo ruivinha te amo
obsessed with how feral this is. absolutely beautiful
What a performance they gave there. I love it
OA vibes
#savetheoa This is amazing!
My God that shyt is FUQING horrible. PLEASE STOP.!!!
This feels like a follow up to which witch
Meu Deus, vi muito the OA aí
😔 Florence used to make MUSIC. She used to make INCREDIBLE MUSIC. Now she makes artistic performance with some background sounds and I DON’T GET IT 😔👎👎
Love Florence but the dancers ruin it for me.
I have no doubt… she’s a Witch! ♥️
this was very haunting. I loved it! Very good
Qué maravilla ver comentarios de admiración hacia Florence en todos los idiomas. Demostrando que el arte no tiene fronteras.
MEU DEUS FLORENCE COMO VOCE OUSA A FAZER UMA PEFEIÇÃO DESSAS MAS TÃO CURTINHA?????
masterpiece
And so it begins...
Still so powerful, voice, music, choreograhy and everything! Just out for Happy Women's Day!
Pois eu AMEI a música ser curtinha
It's like something you would experience in a theatre more than a pop song but that's maybe what she was going for. Still creative and passionate but unfortunately not a memorable tune/song. And she looks like Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrews ex wife, not a good thing.
THE FAE QUEEN BLESSES OUR EARS ONCE MORE
It's giving very much The Handmaid's Tale "BLESSED BE THE FRUIT" "Under his eye"🤣   Aunt Lydia come get em!
reyna de mexico
SAVE THE OA 🕊️
This is way too short
I'm dancing along with the dancers in this music video because the drum beats in this song sound so pretty! Drums are my favorite part of music!🥁🎶💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
Everything about this song is unapologetically raw and instinctive from the trills and unorthodox vocals in the background, fewer instrumentals, trance-like dancing, and blunt lyrics.
I'm still waiting for the day that Florence is gonna drop a bad song. And I think I might wait forever. Not that I mind.
QUEEN! <3
Vision feat. Jordan OUT NOW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-dgFZTlyyE
Thanks for giving us such beautiful and unique music. It's so nice that we still have you in our TikTok generation... Don't sell yourself to those shitty trends. Keep it up, pretty witch 💕
Oh how I missed you! ❤️ You Never disappoint. This is art! 🔥 I hope I get to see you in a concert soon! Sending a big hug from Puerto Rico! 🤙🏽
She is sooo powerful and the woman can dance!!! So excited for this album!!!
This is so amazing, I love every details but why so short?! Please give us more
Miss you so much! Welcome back!
Why are these two new songs so good so far!!! This album is going to be amazing!!
THE OA IS REAL.
Muito conceitual!!!!
https://youtu.be/iBgRe__0ffo
❤️
THE OA
That was just wonderful to watch.
Okay so Autumn de Wilde has worked w Flo on both videos so far.. hope she's gonna be doing the rest
I like the boots
A rare video of Florence teaching us how to be a witch
Essa mulher respira arte, a sucessora da Kate Bush
Uma intro bem diferenciada... se tem uma coisa que Florence + The Machine nunca quisseram fazer é o padrão, o clichê. São esquisitos, SÃO ARTISTAS
Perfect and beautiful in every way! From the direction, contemporary dance, every lyric, and the thought put into it. This entire album will be her best yet!
Satanic garbage
THE ENDING!!!! NO, THIS ENTIRE PIECE OF ARTWORK!!!! ❤️
I love love love love this!
The first and 3rd movements from the OA hiding in plain sight , stay alert angels
Incredible as always. Forever grateful that I am on this Earth to hear more Florence music every time you release more. You are ethereal and so, so important
I just came from work and directly turned on Florence new Song. Wish it would never have ended ❤👁 I already cant Tell which New one my Favorite is, I hope there will be more soon 🥰
Universo, obrigada por trazer Florence até nós!!! Celebração Feminina num dia propício. #MinhaBruxaFavorita
FLAWLESS AS ALWAYS, the beat, the musicality, lyrics, choreo 👑
Another fucking banger, I love it!
Cool
Is she making a musical about witches taking over a city? Because I’m here for it
The OA movements? 🤔
To me.ook like ..the exorcist  movie ..poor art poor performance , pure trash...!!
Já chegando dando like sem ouvir.
I'm covered in goosebumps and a tad sweaty-JUST from sitting and watching this music video. Wow.   Also digging that the track is short. Milks the suspense of what's next in the chapter (fingers crossed their 5th record will be a visual/concept album, like HBHBHB)...  The fact that this incredibly talented woman is going into spoken word is MORE than enough to make me wanna see them live again if they come to Barclay's ❤‍🔥
Caralho! É a maior que temos mesmo pqp
Perfeita 😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Hora de louvar a Deusa
Wow
Essa música é parente da Seven devils
Muito suprema ela! Se um dia tiver uma nova temporada de AHS coven, tem que ter a Florence.
This is turning out to be possible her best work yet !
She is a genius!
I honestly can't imagine what this will be like performed live. So much power!
Holy shit
More pretentious twoddle! BORING!
No closed captioning ;_;
I saw that this song was released earlier today but I haven't been at home where I can listen to it yet. So excited to hear this soon!!
long live the king.
The repeated high pitch rolling chirp vocals remind me so much of the 'Skin the Fool' vocals in the MIDSOMMAR movie.  I'm LOVING the new sounds
Love u🇧🇷💖
Suspiria vibes. <3
Im really not loving this era of florence
I can tell Florence is having fun here
thanks! just what i needed today, a new florence song. hopefully the dog dayz are over soon<3

I love her
La millor
I've been blessed by listening to this masterpiece😍
Florence is on one!! She better calm down
Sounds like a song that would play in #euphoria

this woman's excellence ripes as heaven which is already here.
Instant GOOSEBUMPS‼️‼️
De lo bueno, poco!
I'm dying to see her live.
Did this scare anyone else?

Ficou lindo amei .
e eu devo dizer... QUE TALENTO! QUE SABOR DELICIOSO!
Omg
I smell a visual album, and I'm here for it.
If anyone was wondering about the dance, it's from the OA!! (a beautifully spiritual show on Netflix)
The Nine Muses from Xanadu are back for vengeance!
I could simply write a comment in English but I'll do it in my language " MAMMA MIA "🖤
https://youtu.be/BvooCkc1ilg
Her using the same choreographer as The OA is so perfect to me
Here? Zackly where is here?!?
jesus, misericordia
Aw
Absolutely LOVING the sound and lyrics and videos of these new songs so far as always. <3
literally shivers the entire time
The OA anyone?????Hello!!!
This is the third video with the same type of choreo and structure: it's boring
King's Heaven
Maravilhosa ✨✨✨✨😉✨
At 0:17 I recognized that style of beautiful choreography instantly: The OA!  Despite that show being sadly gone, it makes me happy to see Ryan's movements that remind me of it here.  Absolutely wonderful video, and I hope Marine and Nastia are safe.
What a time to be alive. Blessed to be here & experience her art.
???? I don't get it. What happened to the awesome singing?
Save THE OA!!!
NOW THIS IS INCREDIBLE. No one is doing it like Flo. PERIOD.
Caralho, deveria ter sido o primeiro single, o impacto que seria
Is this satanic? Wow
WOOOOOOW 😎 la ame 🖤
this is woman abuse
We want more!!! ❤️❤️
ALL HAIL OUR KING
¡Demasiado bueno!💯
Yay an interlude. Where's the album?
I love Florence and the machine but this song, I don't know how I feel on it
if you only knew how many times you’ve saved my life
Brilliant, always so dramatic, love her songs and videos. Don't go to heaven too soon though Florence and the machine.
Que energia você passa para nós minha diva 🤩😻 adorei
wow
Those harmonies giving me chills!
love how ancient and primal this is - reminds me of older, minimal, spiritual african, norse and mongolian music like Munknorr, Heilung, Olox, etc. ✨  Keep being amazing and lets flow love and passion and magic back into the world 🌌🌿
I love this 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Handmaid’s Tale meets The OA……..

Cês tão ligados que ela tá falando sobre suicídio de novo, né?
I love you so much 💘🌿🙏🏻
You are very top man, I follow you and I love your songs, All the best to you ❤️❤️❤️
The best !!!!
This feels like interpretive dance. :)
More masterpieces by Flo ❤️
My only complaint about this song is that it wasn’t long enough, I’m craving more of this lyrical bliss!!! Omg I love it so much!!
I can't wait for their new album to drop. I have been a huge fan for a long time now, and have been fortunate enough to have seen them in concert a couple times. I can say that they are one band NOT to miss live. Not many artists, such as F+TM, sound as good or better live than on their studio productions. Very few are able to outshine their songs during their live performances.  Florence and the Machine are truly one of those special bands, that sincerely needs to be heard live. The intensity of the crowd and the grandeur of their music..just breaktakingly unique, as they are certainly a gift to us all. I really like the new song, "King" and I hope their new material is in the same vein. As an artist myself, a dream would be to jam with them. Heck, I'd settle to just be able to sit in on one of their practice sessions. 🥳   Side note: I figure if you took the time to read this, and are a Florence and the Machine fan, you're okay in my book.   🙂🤟
It feels like the Queen is opening a new portal for us subjects to go though and be saved from this world. Long live Florence.
The oa omg
THE WAY I HAVE --- G O O S E B U M P S---- in the FIRST TEN SECONDS OF THIS SONG-- Florence is such an exquisite artist, I hope to meet her one day 💞💞💞💞
Disappointed with Florence for not making it into an anti-war anthem and making a big statement, especially because the video was filmed in Ukraine. COME ON!!! #nowarinukraine #stopputin #stoprussianvasion
É A MAIOR AVISAAAAA ❤️🗣🗣🗣🗣
Florence is Religion now, isn't she?   I truly hope the dancers mentioned in the description as well as everyone else affected by the war find peace and make it out alive. There are no words that can honestly express this chaos.
Baby…this is everything.
That's beautiful 😍
🌸🌸🌸🌸Florence🌸🌸🌸🌸
Pure art. It's almost overwhelming to the point of not being able to look directly at it
YESS
Netta Barzilay did the background singing?😂
O.O WOW! You never cease to amaze! <3
Florence is The O.A.
Ooo do I detect a hint of an homage to The OA in the choreography?  Love it!
THE OA !!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Puro suco de arte e cultura
SHE'S A REAL ARTIST 🛐
She's been through it in these last four years. Something happened. Either way, this is art.
She put her whole florenceussy into this
ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
You don’t know how long I’ve needed this. ❤️
Thankyou for being you and and what your heart/pain shares, your like someone I just want to sit down with and talk for hours
BOOOOOOORIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!
wait...what just happened?
Wtf is this song? Lol…
She is my modern day Kate Bush. 💕 Great Story Teller!
Greyscale everything? ✔ Clearly multi-racial group of female-presenting modern dancers? ✔ Mid-century clothes? ✔  Literally just like all of her other videos. I wonder, is she an actual artist or a figurehead for an aesthetic product?
Breathtaking.
She has N EVER made anything like this! so cool!!
🥰🥰🥰 love u florence
I listen the song of florence and inspire me to write this .  All the thoughts are coming out, ripping and breaking colliding with each other, madness is a very beautiful gift.   All the demons are on your back, they hold on tight and won't let you go, all their voices are singing.   All things add up, isn't history enough? Outside, everything is falling apart.   the voices begin to be more strident, the devil never spoke to you with such certainty, heaven is ours if we wish it.   Your heart is tied to your throat and where before it was empty now is, every time you speak it is your heart, but when you love it feels empty.   Like candles hanging over a hollow body that seizes madness, you illuminate your exterior while your interior darkens.
Te amo ❤️
o que vem por aí mamãe!!!
this woman is pure art
Nenhum defeito.
WOW !!! This album is pristine
NAA, FLORENCE!! QUÉ ARTEEE TE MANDASTE!!... necesito escuchar ese álbum ya!!
Florence veio anunciar que está trazendo THE OA de volta. ❤️❤️❤️
This album is gonna be huge!!!!!!!
Peace for Ukraine Heaven for the victims
Definitely the season of the witch and I love it!
FLORENCE IS BACK AAAHHHH
MEU DEEEEEUSSSS MENINA! Eu não  sei se meu coração vai aguentar até o final dos lançamentos dos singles, de qualquer forma, Florence, sério, OBRIGADO POR CADA OBRA DE ARTE DESSAS!!! 👑 #IamKing
Muy danza contemporánea la coreo.

La reina ha vuelto !!!!!!
Slava Ukraini!

Amazing! 🖤
earth shattering, mind bending, eyes watering, fist clenching masterpiece, her vocals simply never fail!!
Agradeço por existir na mesma época que esta mulher!!!!!
B E A U T I F U L
She is absolutely annoying. Can’t put my finger on it. Her music comes on and my anger intensifies
Esto es glorioso 🥰😍.
love this new era of unapologetic femme fatale artistic weirdness
OMG THIS IS SO PERFECT, ART THIS IS ART, A MASTERPIECE OMG
I see someone loves The OA as much as I do.
This isn't a song. This is a spell. ❤️🪄🧙
Your music, your art, your voice brings out my warrior. Love you.
Amazing as ever. I am so happy to hear new stuff from you <3  (my fave tat is still my forearm piece that was inspire by Rabbit Heart!)
D:
omg Florence <3 I need a bonfire to dance this one around. Peace and strength to your dancers.
Throwback to Lungs/ Ceremonials Florence. Love it
YAAAASSSSSS!!!!!
i just woke up, it's 4 AM in the morning and watched this. what a blessing from a queen.
Amazing song and video!   But is it just me or haven't her face become thinner?
I love the choreography so much! It’s really reminds me of the OA tv show. It looks like she is trying to open a dimension or portal or casting a new spell. I love her!
I. Want. It. 7.13.22
Why everything you make is stunning ❤️‍🔥
Beautiful but there is never anything else from her 💕
This album is volcanic in power - I feeeeeeel it
beautiful and pretentious ...
This is DELICIOUS!!
My only wish is for this to be 4hours longer. Thank you for saving my sanity.
I can already see all the TV shows using this track
Straight outta suspiria
Oh my fucking God
Everything she does is incredible. Happy that we are able to listen such a masterpiece these days
MANO DO CÉU O QUE FOI ISSO, FLORENCE EU TE AMO
I'm mesmerised. This repetitively gives me goosebumps on my arms and makes my jaw drop to the floor. Such a pity this masterpiece is only two minutes long. Thank you Florence for gifting us with such beauty in this cruel, cruel world.
The way Florence is writing the entire soundtrack to handmaids tale
this gave me... Midsommar cult vibes! I'm loving this new era <3 <3 <3  Also, it's giving me Catholic Church Inquisition witch hunt, burning witches at stakes or hanging witches on a tree kinda vibe.
She’s like wine - it just gets better with time 💕
Entregando TUDOOOOOO
Me encanta la energía que le pone a sus videos, el nuevo disco debe estar bueno.
Good song but feels shorter than 2 minutes for some reason
choreography is giving The OA
Mais um album caríssimo que ter que comprar com gosto
obrigada por existir Florence.
¡Es fantástica! Espero que el disco llegue pronto.
Which Witch vibes. Didn't think she would release something like this as a single. Interesting!
When you a bad bitch hot girl, but also a faerie princess goddess twerking on a lily pad. YES FLORENCE!!!! ✨😭
I am going to be honest ... I'm a little speechless right now.
This sounds like something that belongs in The Witcher
Florence invented witches
Perfeitaaaaaa
Florence tu música siempre esta llena de energía, siempre me hace sentir poderosa, estoy ansiosa para escuchar tu nuevo disco! Todas las mañanas me levanto para ir a trabajar y siempre en mi playlist está algunas de tus canciones
Love love love love love this so much! ♥
estou absolutamente ARREPIADA!!! <3 a DEUSA tá entregando TUDO ME DÁ MAIS PQ ESSES ÚLTIMOS 2 ANOS ME DEIXARAM COM SEDE
my head: no thoughts, only florence 💖
Florence out here singlehandedly reconstructing anglo-saxon culture and spiritualism
This is what I imagine the Salem girls were singing
She has taken art to another level
It’s not a song 😕 i don’t like this kind of “art”
Maravilhosa essa mulher!
Your music is so incredibly powerful. I always feel like I'm being hugged by my coven when I listen to your art
I've been watching "The King" on repeat and now this, to see her start to become the King from one of the women of the coven? HECK YES
this is amazing
Ladies and gentlemen, the High Priestess is back
Não prometeu nada e simplesmente entregou tudo
MARAVILHOSA!!!
Ela sabe entregar tudo sem prometer! Te amo, Florence 😍🥰❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You never cease to amaze me 😍😍😍🌟🌟🌟
ART  PURE ART
Wow
FLORENCE!!!!! I literally just went “wait ANOTHER ONE” ive never felt more alive
yessssssssss
Almost sure that she watched midsummer before putting this record out
My love for this… for Florence… breaks my heart.. yet my heart regrows twice as big… the ever expanding love bursts my heart again… my heart doubles once more… this sea of love cannot be contained by the confined well of my mortal form… burst heart… cells part… love be free in its entirety
Está como flojo
My perfect witch 🌷
But an amazing amazing artist and piece of music Florence you are a goddess❤🔥❤🔥
La amo
I’m so excited Florence is BACK 😭  Just the other week I was wonder when she was going to release new music!  The goddess heard me 😍 I’m so ready for this new album 🤩
😮😍💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
holy shit
Só pra deixar com gosto de quero mais 🥲🥲🥲🥲
This is so good Florence I love you mother king 😭💜❤️
Omg it gave me the chills, so simple yet so amazingly powerful Everything she does is a masterpiece!!!! I just love her so much!!
Magik
Me encanto la conotación que tiene el video, sobretodo lo que hoy en día las mujeres pasamos. El ser señaladas y  juzgadas.
I’m always excited for the choreography since she loves expressive dancing.
Two minute Florence+The Machine song feels like a hurricane stuck inside a tic-tac candy... They got me fervently waiting to hear this new album!
I was not expecting this, but I love it :o
Yeah, devil's calling
Visualmente Maravilloso! Musicalmente mas alla de lo maravilloso ❤. Tan poquito que dura la canción y tanto que logra expresar. Toda una obra de arte 🔥
Mesmerizing choreography, powerful lyrics. Have loved Florence for a decade and will only continue to.
Wow I'm like that so creative and crazy 🥰🥰
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm getting Salem witch-female empowered-freedom- love is synonymous with death vibes and I love it all. I love the aggressive passionate dancing and the simplicity of filming in the same scene with the same girls in the same boots as KING. I just love her. Love you Flo
Ame  vídeo , canción , Flo  , todooo  🤩
Mamãe nunca erra 💕💕💕
"Heaven is here if you want it..." Mother you are a goddess, love it 👑🖤😘
bufo
O quanto ela me faz pensar no que veio, no que vem.. e a espera do que vir. SIMPLESMENTE TOCANTE !
Hasn’t she already done this choreography…. Treading water .
I love it so so much! It’s the first of many, many listens. Thank you Florence 😍❤️🤍
Todavía no supero que Florence y Gaga no hayan lanzado Hey girl, sería un éxito y el mensaje feminista es increíble y genuino. Ambas tan arte
FLORENCE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I'M SO GLAD BECAUSE YOU TURNED BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FLORENCE IS BACK AND SHE'S COOLER THAN EVER
Watching this rhythmless dance is hilarious.
I'm in love with this new era of Florence + The Machine. I just turned 18 and I am ready to let my life to be guided by this new music.
ACLAMADISSIMA DONA DE TUDO E DE TODOS EU TE AMOOOOOI
magnífica!
The OA
You are a Goddess and I am speechless!
Please disappoint sometime? She's a goddess.
She always elevates her craft it's always about expression and a soulful performance.
Entregando tudo com perfeição como sempre. Te amo deusaaaaa 💜💖
I'm in love with the new witchy side of Florence
As netas das bruxas que voces nao queimaram hoje fazem magia com a raba pro alto
Voice ov an angel 👼
me desmayé tres veces
w o w
Ceremonials is back
Very like Kate Bush
Absolute art! Amazing.
thank you from Ukraine
The Supreme!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
🎼❤️👌
This music video weirdly reminds me of The Crucible by Arthur Miller. Love the vibes!
Love me something Florence!!! Her last album I continuously play repeatedly, love this video feeling the feminine power!!!🙌🏽💝🤘🏾
BRAAAAAAAAVO!!!!!!!!!
Come on with the NEW MUSIC FLORENCE!!!!
i dont know much about music but i love how these new song are sounding! your music goes straight to my soul
I don’t deserve to be alive at the same time as Florence is releasing her artwork. I’m literally not worthy of this
No one takes us to the places you do. A desperately needed artist for today. Organic, furious and beautiful. I have been excited for the moment Florence would take the spoken word plunge - which I always felt she wanted to but perhaps wasn’t ready until now. The poetry, dance and music are becoming amorphous as Florence unravels and brings us ever closer to her heart.
Florence nunca va a dejar de sorprenderme! Esta canción dura apenas dos minutos y es tan poderosa como una de cuatro minutos o mas! Me encanta! La letra, los arreglos y la voz de de Flo; todo en ella es magia! Te amo Florence💙Heaven is Here because of you 💙💙💙
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
OKEY MISS WITCH YOURE JUST AMAZING I CANT BREATHE RN
Wouuu! Quede sin palabras  ¿Qué es toda esta maravilla?
I need the album immediately 🪄 🔮
TE AMO MULHER VC EH ARTE
Just started listening to this phenomenal woman.
🔥 The bridge is very Tori and I'm so here for it and all this perfect authentic witchy energy (Big God-like)!!!! 💖
I am THIRSTYYYYY for this album
Someone watch out for Florence. Those lyrics and songs are beautiful but the darkness of it  really makes me wonder if she is doing alright
She can dance!?
how strong it is, I felt the tremor and power of every movement. dance ritual that emanates magic of earth.
TE AMO ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You cast a spell of protection. Hugs :**********
Afterlife
LENDAAA
could it all be a short film???!!!! i’m so excited for this new chapter ♥️♥️♥️
It's like watching a painting come to life what??? This is beautiful
FLORENCE I FUCKING LOVE U
The sound effects are amazing!
Sounds a bit like Haka to me. I love it!! Thanks Florence!
WOW, another video filmed at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute!  🇺🇦 Слава Україні!
جميل جدا.. موسيقى رائعة .. حتى فكرة الكليب جدا خيالية ومدهشة. أحسنتي
Read video description; two of the dancers in this video are currently sheltering in Ukraine (Marine, Nastia) I hope peace returns soon. 💙💛
Wow.. so amazing.
THIS IS ART, POETRY AND A STATEMENT.
I miss the acoustic of ceremonials.
🇧🇷🎶❤
A BRUXA TÁ SOLTA <3
the only supreme we need
I love love this so much ❤️ I just really wish it was a bit longer 😭
This time I'm just speechless... I'm speechless.
I really hope the two Ukrainian dancers remain safe. They are all phenomenal in these mvs
She is one of those artists that didn't compromise to the standard pop radio sound just because she had some hits. Her attention to her artistry continues to impress me with every release and I look forward to hearing the new sound on the album!
Heaven..........like 15K   3 7 22
This album is gonna be a spiritual revival
You make all my days better. Currently you are the main reason I'm smiling. Thank you
MARAVILLOSOOOOOOO
It looks like its going to be a great album
Another Odyssey? I really hope so.
MANO Q PERFEIÇÃO EU TE AMO FLORENCE EU TE AMOOOO
*W O W*
She's far beyond from anything else!
Te amo! Gracias por tu música, gracias por salvar mi vida
A bruxa está voltando com tudo!
FLORENCE DID THAT ONCE AGAIN. LOVE HOW WE KINDA LEFT OF WHERE KING FINISHED.
This is pure art, I love her so much.
GRACIAS POR TANTO ARTE FLORENCEDEIDAD ❤
What's with the quality of the video?
Tru Love
I always felt like Florence can easily be an acress in a horror movie
Such a raw energy! Loved it so much!
Beyond beautiful! I'm sooo excited for the rest of the album. Is she doing a video for every song do you think? She's using a unique release style
We are your coven Flo! 💜
This is pure magic. This video is the perfect compliment to this awesome song. I love everything about it.💛💛💛
Wow! Un RITUAL de ARTE! Un AQUELARRE de EMOCIONES! Florence es asombrosa! Heaven is Here! 😍
DIOSAAAA 🛐❤
your songs are an escape rope for many people, thank you for that
En muy poco tiempo , de un tiempo a la fecha  me enamoré de sus canciones a pesar de antes no agradarme 😍😅
OH MY GODDD THIS IS SO SUSPIRIA!!
Thank you Florence, this grief and anger are my feelings right now and most russians actually, I’m angry that the government we didn’t choose has made a huge mistake that cost actual lives and our future as a country. I am grieving for all the people who are now suffering in Ukraine. We try our best to help, but there is almost no way, we can’t even share truth, there is a law because of that most of the honest people can end up in jail.
Where can I join the coven? 🔥
this woman is a witch and this album is an invitation to join her coven 💕
Florence absolutely stunning. I hope, Nastya and Marine is safe now. Good work, Radioaktive Film. Слава Украине!
beautifully spine chilling
Diosa del Olimpo! Te amo Florencia 🔥🔥🖤🖤
Su música es la cosa más hermosa que he escuchado en mucho tiempo, su expresión corporal siempre logra expresar de más su música 😍🤩
In this terrible time for Ukraine your music makes me feel better and i believe in the future you'll come to Ukraine again.
Mulher o que foi isso? Adorei
Florence lyrics hit your soul exactly right, she is a eloquent poet and dancer! This song has an incredible intention and I love it Oh Florence
AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS AQUARIUS

Idk why I cried at the end. Woman I love you thank you
CARALHO ESSA NOVA ERA
I'm not sure I understand this song? Like the ending is visceral, I get that. But what's the build up to it mean? Coming as someone who loves the music and just wants to understand the song <3
achei que seria uma música
This is the type of song to be played in a hedonistic midnight ritual in the forest 😂😌
So sad to hear about the two dancers in this video who are sheltering during the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. I hope for their and everyone in Ukraine’s safety. Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦
It’s gonna be a witchy summer
First good thing about This already God forsaken year. The World is going to shit, but the Muse told us Heaven is Here.
Мать. Лучшая на свете
A própria neta das bruxas...essa mulher é um patrimônio cultural vivo. Te amoooo 🇧🇷💗
Perfection as always. Love the drama
love love love this
A deusa
FILMED IN BUFFALO??? LMAO! YOU'RE IN!
Her level of artistry is intimidating in the most inspiring way.
Te amo, bb que música tan hermosa.
lovely, poignant!
Obrigado por essa bênção, Florence, obrigado 🖤🖤
SING! DANCE! MY "GREY NUNS"!!!!
I have chills ahh!! This is phenomenal!!!
BRING ON THE FULL ALBUM AHHHHH
"Heaven is Here" lyrics Oh bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it Oh bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water drank every drop lIl turn your sea to a desert More catholic taste than the devil All gilded and golden yes I'm your girl Hell if it glitters I'm going And I ride In my red dress And time stretches endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my Man And every song I wrote Became an escape rope Tied around my neck To pull me up to heaven
This isn't just music, nor just art! Moreover it is magic!
I am so excited for this album!
Somehow I can see some of the movements from the serie The OA. I just love it. It’s so powerful.  Thanks Florence.
Shes just so...amazing!
She's the Supreme Witch and she knows it
I think this would have worked better as an intro to King. Still.. beautiful dance
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TE AMO FLORENCEEEEE
linda , voz boa , perfeita ♥
I think this is defending the opener to the album, especially with the breathing at the end. It’s leaves u wanting more…
I'm SO excited for this album <3
word
diosa
Amoooooooo
So good.
Suspiria? No, Florence and the coven showing how to performe
A cada single, a perfeição só melhora aaaaaaa
Just heard this song in apple radio it’s fire nfs🔥🔥
YES FUCK IT UP FLO IM SO HYPED FOR THIS NEW ERAAAAAAA
Florence about this song ❤ "Heaven is Here was the first song I wrote in lockdown after an extended period of not being able to get to the studio. I wanted to make something monstrous. And this clamour of joy, fury and grief was the first thing that came out. With dance studios also shut it was my dream to one day create choreography with it. So it’s one of the first pieces of music I have made specifically with contemporary dance in mind."
Love this new clip from suspiria 2! ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Opening youtube to see this made me feel like a little kid again ♥️♥️
Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I’ll protect Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 2] Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 3] And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I’ll turn your sea to a desert  [Verse 4] More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I’m your girl Hell, if it glitters, I’m going  [Bridge] And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man  [Outro] And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
Amazing I love it, a beautiful piece of art both visually and vocally
Or she is high or she is doing some exorcism shit.

😍😍😍😍

The only bad thing about this song is that it's only 2 minutes long 😭😍
MINHA DEUSA QUE OBRA DE ARTE MARAVILHOSAAAAAA!
Power!!! Fuck yes. I didnt think this was going to release for 4 hours yet. Yay
AMAZING!!!!!!
nie mogę uspokoić płaczu
POR DEUS,  QUE COISA FANTÁSTICA!
😍💚🌺✨
the backing vocals/music reminds me so much of the Indonesian 'tari saman' -- filled with shrill screams and heavy on steady beats
Another masterpiece! This era has been amazing!
2 song so far and the 4 years waiting were already worth it.
TE AMO FLORENCE!!! <3
GENTE, SÓ TEM BR NOS COMENTÁRIOS!
Absolutely. Absolutely yes
Getting a “When Doves Cry” vibe from the chorus
Mi amor platónico!! 😱
Flo is a fairy queen and no one can convince me otherwise
AMAZING!!! I LOVE THIS SONG, THANK YOU FLORENCE, I LOVE YOU!! <3
Heavenly sung 🤍☺️
Atemporal ❤️
So powerful, so beautiful
Oh noooo another 2 minutes song

I'm shocked 😵 This new sound is so cool 🤯 I'm already in love and can't wait to listen to the complete project ❤️
ela quer acabar comigo, só pode ✨✨✨✨✨✨😮😮😮😮💜💜💜💜
She's a witch even if she's unaware of it, and I mean that in the best way.
heaven is here and you're bringing it right now, flo x
Love the music. love the videos, but I've got to admit, I'm a tad worried about her.  She's got some issues to work out, methinks.
WOW! 🥰
Absolute art
*. RFS Israel
florence com música de 2 minutos? hmm isso tem cara de interlude 👀 já quero o álbum ❤️❤️❤️
This one didn't go well with me.
Estou chocado.
I love you Florence, you're an inspiration ❤️

Te amooooo
Aaaaaaaaah, por ti vivo

Well wishes and love to Marine and Nastia   💕 Beautiful song and visual, can't wait to hear and see more!
aleluiaaaaassssssss xaramanaias levanta igreja que a pastora chegou pra ramanamanamana aleluiaaaaa
Ok this is weird, not really a song... I'll just listen to King and the older stuff
So intense
MOTHER
🌟✌
If anyone read her description in the video you will see there’s 2 girls from that music video that are currently taking shelter & hiding from the Ukraine & Russia war. That ending where Florence is frozen but breathing hard as if she was pissed, shows how much anger women have to this world that is being destroyed by men while women have to just “take it” but Florence has never been an artist that just takes it & I’m sure she will definitely release music & write about the tragedy’s that’s been happening lately.
“I’ll turn your seas to a desert”  Heaven is here💚
i love how this era feels like such a calling to be free and true to yourself no matter how gritty or loud or scary people may find you. your authentic self is needed, the feral witch within who was broken down and stigmatized rises up.
AMOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Florence is full of great songs
#SaveTheOA
*Comunicando com o corpo  🧚🏻‍♀️.*  *FADA SUPREMA!*

Perfeita demais!! Sem palavras 💚💜
Not sure what it’s about, almost like a cult worship
Dear Florence! Thank you for your support. I live in Kyiv which russia's nazzies trying to capture right now. I believe that your words will be oracular and Ukraine will be heaven soon again. I thing you should come to us with your new tour emediatly after our victory.
DEUSA TE AMO AMÉM 🛐🛐🙏

Uauu 💙💙💙💙
❤
#savetheoa
Its amazing how she can reinvent herself and still be original <3
*Enviando as melhores energias para Marine , Nastia e suas famílias 🙌🏻.*
Flo is my favorite musical witch next to Stevie Nicks.
One word: DAMN.
Me recuerda a los 5 movimientos de The OA y la parte del medio de la canción me recuerda a Scotland de the Lumineers tambien como el medio de la canciones, y me encanta 😅
I want to belong to her coven 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I thought it was 7 minutes in Heaven not 2 minutes 😣
eu estou chorando..... florence do céu !!!!!!!!!!!!
TE AMO BRUJITA
Florence carries the weight of being the biggest and best artist of this generation
Am I the only one here hoping for a spicy new album? No? Ok.
omg that ending gave me chills she is coming
I can't wait to loudly chant this song at the concerts!!!!
pqp que foda
YAY new song !
Shocking ! Point taken!  Florence I ❤️ your MUSIC🥰
HEAVEN IS HERE BUT IT'S ONLY FOR 1 MIN & 51 SEC-LONG 😭🔥
Arrepiei…
Essa mulher não cansa de ser PERFEITA
This is why I always come back to FLorence + the machine, pure GOLD, amazing, You can feel it from the first moment, I loved it
I am so here for Florence and her coven
Great song but 8 hope she's okay considering the lyrics.
and every song I wrote became an escape rope tied around my neck to pull me up in heaven
Florence truly doesn’t just make music, it’s performance art at its finest. Literally nothing on this Earth makes my soul transcend my body like her voice - it’s beautiful 🤍
Florence is out of this world 😍🖤
THAT’S MY VIRGO !!! 😭😭😭🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
is this Florence witch era?
I admire you Florence💙
Feels like Florence is trying to start a cult made up of vengeful women who go around slaying bad men and I'm here for it
This is just EPIC!!!!
THIS IS AMAZING
This is a cult I would like to join
Que hino. Deusa
Great great
Wow! This is an amazing piece of work!  Florence is never selling out.
God
Very unique choreography which remind me a bit of the movie Susperia. And I totally love it💕
Thank u Florence for this art 🖤
This song reminds me of the movie Constantine where both heaven and hell were shown as places on earth.
💜🍀
hoping beyond hope that tour dates are on the horizon!!!
Oh my Goddess 😍😍😍
Até a Florence lançando música de 2min... olha, Britto, sinceramente...

Listening to Florence is like a religious experience, it's amazing.
FLORENCE I LOVE YOU
She giving what needs to be gave!
Wow 😯
Bruxonaaaa 💖
YESSSSS
Heaven Is Florence
1:00 background singing sounded like Reign's soundtrack... i think it was Lumineers-Scotland🤩
Woah, yes! I was worried I wouldn’t like it. I absolutely love you
I liked more this than king
DEUS NO CEU E FLORENCE WELCH NA TERRA
Incredible!!!!
Blllllaaaaahhhhhh
gracias amor
BEAUTIFUL
I instantly loved this!
This is so reminiscent of "Which Witch" to me and I am loving it.   My initial interpretation?  This song is largely a commentary on her sobriety, but also how our vices never fully leave us, instead shapeshifting alongside us.  Absolutely beautiful, fantastically feral, and poignant as always.
Artista é a definição dessa deusa.
florence, you are a genius
Damn kween (king!)! I’m so psyched for the album! 💗
fucking weird
So...is Florence coven taking new girls in?
He has a cue from the song the lumineers scotland
Suena a intro de un disco que va a tener mucha fuerza. COMO LA ADORO!!!!!!
Gente que clipes potentes da Florence.  Socorro!
Gente que clipes potentes da Florence.  Socorro!
AHHHHHHH THE QUEEN IS BACK 🙌🏼 🙌🏼
Florence siempre hace cosas totalmente increíbles!
Único defeito é que acaba
Amei 💜
This is everything
Espectacular 😍.
Florence: wouldst thou like to live deliciously?
OMG! I CAN´T WAIT FOR THE WHOLE ALBUM. The end is just amazing! The lyrics are so good.
They're going to release a new album soon, I'm calling it now.
What an awesome video!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just loved it <3 <3 <3
Auntie Florence are you okay
This era of their music is so dark..  I love it~ 😈🔮💜
this is a vibe fr
Wow.
I love you ily ily
This approach of music videos brings me back to the Odyssey.
I love how each of their album has the same look and feels throught the songs.
¡Me encanta su estilo, y su voz es arte puro de verdad es una de mis artistas favoritas y creo que su talento trasendera a través de los años, saludos desde Veracruz Puerto México!
i'm in love with florence's music napenda
this was uncalled for 😭
Brasil 🇧🇷 amoooooo
My witch senses are tingling
There are no words to describe your music <3
I'm 28 years old.. but I want to be like her when I grow up!
4K resolution IS needed, thank you.
This is just amazing ✨🖤
The always evolving Queen
Sem palavras! Simplesmente brutal! 🖤🔥
❤️
It's too short!!!!
I love Florence's music it's so inspirational &she just breathes life into her lyrics her voice is incomprable!
The outro “And every song I wrote became an escape rope tied around my neck to pull me up to heaven” OMGGGG the amount of power that those words have, I love Florence’s way of writing and expressing herself
you could mute this video, tell me it's the sequel to Stomp the Yard, and I still would end curled up on the floor in unexplainable joy.
The lyrics are heaven. Thank you Mother Witch.
The dance choreography won't disappoint to creep me out in a good way
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS CHOREOGRAPHY RESEMBLES THE OA'S TRAVELING BETWEEN DIMENSIONS DANCE?????
Fucking chills.
WOW
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN.
Icon
💃💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
I'm not ready I'm not ready!!!!!
Another song, another masterpiece !!
🥰🥰🥰
I needed this.
I’m lying on the couch while Florence dangles over my body like I’m Nell and she’s The Bent Neck Lady from Haunting of Hill House
THIS WOMAN MAKES ART
Evokes images of the girls lost to the witch trials! The dancing, the dresses, the boots, wild hair, frenzied woman lost in trance dancing in circles! Covens! Empowering and evocative! Florence brings it each time! Heaven is definitely here if you want it! 🖤
GOOSEBUMPS.
My heaven, to hear your creations is always a blessing!!! Florence and the Machine. Thank you for always being wonderful.
Florence, entenda, você é perfeita! Que saudadessss!!!
I adore you, Florence. None like you.
Love You Florence
prairie???
Dear Florence.  This last year hasn't been the best, I'm not telling you more details. however you and you music have been motivating me not to give up. If I had the chance to thank you of any or other way, don't doubt I'll do
Se togliamo la coreografia non c'è nulla, spero sia un semplice interludio nell'album... Mah
Mlr eu te amo
The live shows are going to be next level!! YAAS FULLL (alt)POP STAR!!
I can foresee this song used in a zillion movie trailer
love her Xx
Florence is my supreme 💕😭
Wow! 💫🎶
Incredible
Let's go baby
Perfeita
Wow. Just wow ♥️
WHO IS DOING IT LIKE HER?!?!??!?!???!?!? NO ONE!
PUTA QUE PARIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Brutal. Que gusto que aún pueda sorprenderme
waddafuck!!! I wasn't expecting the choreo. cos it destroys her tough rock image. I applaud her dancing skills, but it is laughable to see mama doing this choreo. Meh!
Asi si!
Criminally short. 😭 whyyyyyyyyy
I really don’t like it ! (But I’m a Florence fan…)
that was brilliant
Couldn't be more disappointed with this era 😥
First day comment
Amazing my queen, Brazil loves you🔥🤗🇧🇷
The Queen Witch is feeding the gays and the girls good!
Florence is now my religion.
LA REINA DEL ALTERNATIVO
SU PRE MA
Florence is creating her own music genre right in front of our eyes… how could you NOT stan?-?
e vamos de mais xamanismo urbano
Am I the only person who thinks this is kinda shit? I've always loved Florence but what is this?
💙💛
Absolutely perfect!
Amadaa!! Assim meu coração não  aguenta  ❤❤
never let me go!
Florence you are an endless river of beauty and inspiration! Thank you for being so strong, powerful and brave. Thank you for being yourself and giving us the hope and power to be ourselves. Thank you for everything... Can't wait for the whole album  💜💜💜
I love you Florence!
Im really getting a feeling that this is they last álbum and they going out with a bang
Yesssssssss! ❤️
I fucking love you
Essa mulher é muito perfeita!!!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖
can't believe she single handedly ended ww3 with this serve
she is unmatched
florence welch avisa que vai ter bruxaria mais tarde bb
FATM NEVER FAILS TO DELIVER MASTERPIECE
Yasssssssssss Florence  !!
So powerful
Wow nice song.
Florence: "Heaven is here if you want it" Putin: "I’ll turn your sea to a desert" Ukrainians: "FCK OFF PTN"
Who needs shit like Adele when we have Florence?
The whole thing feels like witch ritual!!
I'm so happy to be here
#savetheoa
QUE OBRA DE ARTE!!! Suas músicas me inspiram e me salvam todos os dias <3
this song lacks a crescendo.
Sounds good from first 2 songs. She's been listening to Fiona Apple I feel.
I loved this one.  I seems like it's the beginning of the process for her to become the witch on  "King".. I guess this is probably the first or second track of the album AMAZING DANCE!
DEUSA!!!!
coolest person on earth!
TE AMO FLORENCE SOS MÁGICA
At the end I was like: What did I just watched? 😳 Masterpiece ❤️
*screams in Salem*
Iconic love 💕
i still find it hard to believe that Florence shot this and probably the entire video album in MY university, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute 💙💛  she was closer to me than ever, i mean i live like 3km from there, lol. I'm jealous of everyone now who might have seen her and there's a huge chance we сould cross cause she spent 3 weeks here.  Come back with your tour, when the war's over. We love you so much and extremely excited for the new album ❤‍🩹
The witch never left
Florence esta de vuelta señoras y señores!!!
She is actually wearing the same underwear she had in the Drumming Song MV.
Always so theatrical, love it 😍
Que potência de ser vivo. Sua arte é linda, Florence. ♥
Love every aspect of this 💕 waiting for the album in tender hooks
DROP THAT ALBUM ALREADY
Speechless. Thank you, my queen of peace.
this bitch is crazy in the best way possible
Could be a better videoclip
Prometeu nada e ENTREGOU TUDO! Perfeita como sempre! Af 💙😍
She really did that
Флоренс все клипы для нового альбома сняла в Киеве, по ходу. Это непередаваемое чувство, когда видишь в иностранном клипе СОВЕТСКИЕ батареи отопления ;)
PERFEITAAAAA, BRAZIL TE AMA E ESPERA ANSIOSO POR UM SHOW SEU AQUI
Love it! And stay safe Marine and Nastia! 💞
Looks like the same set and dancers as "King" - will the whole album be set here?
Now cousin Flo, you didn't have to EAT this hard. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gurl, THE CREATIVITY! 🥹👏✨🤌
foi diferente de tudo que eu imaginava e melhor do que esperei! heaven is here, com você aqui, Flo, não tenho dúvidas. ♥
YES HY:LY!!!!
So epic and fresh sound that's raw and a rush!
Anyone know exactly how glass animals were involved?
EU TO MUITO ABENÇOADO
I am really not a fan of the new sound
More than a musician, a true artist by definition
Her dancing and just in general body expression is getting better and better and better... it's mesmerizing.
Intriguing song and video!
Florence, thank you for sharing your talent and your art with us! We've missed you! ❤️
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 my heart is no fireee
Maguinifica, I love you Florence 💚🇧🇷🤩
THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO WORDS FOR YOUR WORK
Jaw dropped to the floor. I'm just amazed by this.   Thoughts go out to your dancers in shelter and everyone else in Ukraine! <3
awestruck. just awestruck.
The snarling rage in this is glorious!!
Ok. 😐

I love the Pina Bausch references in the choreo! Sacre du printemps vibes ✨
Simplesmente incrível, lindo, sem nenhum defeito. 💜

Literally in tears. Full body goosebumps. Florence NEVER disappoints.🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥
É isso, desenterrar minhas revistinha de wicca e começar a procurar umas amiga pra montar um coven.
La obra de arte que están siendo sus videos, solo puedo imaginarme como va a ser escucharlo en vivo 💕
Witch Queen... Perfeita demais, amo e sempre amarei ❤
Solo voy a decirle a Florence Leontine Mary Welch que: ªªªªªª

YAS KING!!!! ♡♤ I LOVE YOU ALL THE TIME
FLORENCE + THE BATUQUE TA DE VOLTAAAAA

What a way to start a Monday! Happy she’s back!
what in the midsommar is going on ? <3
So excited for whats to come 💙😬
BRB gotta go put on a flowy dress so I can perform a contemporary dance in my living room for my dogs
Omgggg
Big fan of her but this one is not for me. Too disorganized, it made me uncomfortable to listen to because it tried to be something but never reached its potential :(( King tho was amazing hah
Heaven Is Here Lyrics [Verse 1] Oh, bring your salt, bring your cigarette Draw me a circle and I'll protect Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 2] Oh, bring your boy, bring your bottle Open your mouth, pour it down his neck Heaven is here if you want it  [Verse 3] And all of the fish, let them flounder I went to the water, drank every drop I'll turn your sea to a desert  [Verse 4] More catholic taste than the Devil All gilded and golden, yes, I'm your girl Hell, if it glitters, I'm going  [Bridge] And I ride in my red dress And time stretchеs endless With my gun in my hand You know I always get my man  [Outro] And еvery song I wrote became an escape rope Tied around my neck to pull me up to Heaven
Truly stunning video and song! Inspired. Can’t wait for the next album.
Esse álbum tá muito teatral até agora
Reminds me of Midsummar
Diosa Etérea ❤️Gracias por tu arte
I'am a fan but I don't like this one at all
Ctmre
literally a goddess
Preciosa música como siempre
Love you Florence <3
Perfect timing for the upcoming Virgo full moon. Just beautiful.
BRUXONA RAINHAAAAA! ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
the "and every song I wrote became an escape rope tied around my neck to pull me up to heaven" part got me gaping
heaven is here literally 🤍
Amazing!
My birthday present 🥰 thank you Florence!!!
boring....
Florence I swear if you don't come to Brazil I will hunt you down and I will find, girl
THE BLACK FLORENCE HAS RETURNED! I AM READY!
The heaven is the place where you can here Florence's music
Please, I need the extended director’s cut with 10 minutes! So freakin’ perfect 😍
I adore her ❤
Its actually so sad that this banger of a song is so short, not even 2 minutes long.
EXCELENTE COMO SIEMPRE NUNCA DECEPCIONA. FLORENCE VOLVE A ARGENTINA!
DAMN AMAZING ✨❤️
This is amazing
This song is bloody brilliant! Oddly mystical as well.
This is so powerful  💀💗
I love the new approach to her music and lyrics she is taking. The sound effects and the visuals on this are amazing - the song is like spoken word but with a beat and a soul. Can't wait for the album. Love you Florence ❤
Straight up power and flames! 🔥🔥🔥
A BRUXA ESTÁ DE VOLTA ❤️❤️❤️
Florence this is a warrior cry and I love it

I just love her 💜
Oh my god this is absolutely wonderful! I'm totally in love with her music, it gives me so much inspiration for my personal book project. Her music with evocative and captivative lyrics has helped me a lot, thank you Florence + The Machine!
This has some traditional Ukraine sounds 🥰💕
I'm here for this!
Perfeita, entregou tudo.
This slightly (and brilliantly) reminds me of Reign by The Lumineers!
