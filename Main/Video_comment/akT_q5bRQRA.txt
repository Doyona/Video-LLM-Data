I love when he says balls it got me cracking
4:40 Why can't we tell the boys about this challenge
Pls do paint art
Michelle piece looked the best .. if she was in that pole, she would've won
Zach I love your videos especially meckenzi she is the best artist ever and I am also an artist
Michelle is so good
Hi
I hope Michele wins🏆 🥇
THE GIRLS
I can confirm girls night is entirely ritualistic
Team McKenzie but I’m starting to like jaz and Izzy
Is it just me or all of them have there hair painted
Michelle’s clearly would’ve won this one, she had the best and the cleanest piece!!!
literally everyone has colored hair
M
Izzy ❤
Zack and Ahmad is one big punde... If don't know Tamil go ask someone who knows that
And Ahmad is punde
How pathetic Zack is
He hates his own gf creation
Punde Zach .. the Michelle swan was way nicer than all of them
Izzy is pretty
You should try paper skulpers.

Some reason I ship , McKenzie and Jake
I felt soo bad when the subscriber roasted Michelle
Izzy once said We bathed in the blood of our enemies 😂
@ZHCYT how about David

Hi team good work
Wow

The amount of balls in this video 😂
I felt like Michelle was 2nd place with hers although it was small it had the most detail you could see on camera atleast
Love jake and McKenzie
I loved the swan
Why is Michell always out first
I still don't know if this real if so this can be getting out of hand
I think michelle shouldve won! Hers was so good and detailed
Why Michelle why what was Michelle the first one who got out who’s turned out really really good. Michelle keep going❤
Jake and kens are like bf and gf but they are not

power rangers girls edition
I love your videos    You always inspire me with doing more art because I love doing art and im getting better and better❤
McKenzie is always on the end of the table
Michelle has improved sooooooo much
Plz call me
ZHC tell Izzy is hot and looks like a magestic tiger
(θ‿θ)
Bro is so calm after winning 2000 dollars 💀💀💀 luv ur vids btw ❤️❤️
all of us can agree that jazes smile is everything-
My ratings  Top: gorilla, swan Mid: motorcycle, barn owl Bottom: alpaca unicorn thingy. <— it’s too big ehe
I love how all them wear the same color of there hair and even the boys do!
The swan eas better than the gorilla
If jaz art wwas not destroyed by angry IZZY she would win or get 2nd place
i GUESS MCKENZIE DESERVED IT
i FEEL SO BAD FOR JAZ
I just laugh when McKenzie said Poor Little Jakey BOO  he already has fomo he sent me what are you guys working on ? I will send you guys to red
your hair is same colour as clothes
I personally thought Michelle was going to win but congrats to Izzy. (I don't know if this is how you spell Izzy).
I like the ones where kenz is loud and fights with Jake is the best
Would love to see ben🥰
the challenge may have been for the girls, but this video is for the boys
Purple win about white kick of so hard i fond purple wins
I would’ve made a dinosaur head
Izzy was on her phone
I love Izzy
Kick the balls💀
Jaz has a great personality and great smile, she’s the one who makes my day and is grateful
Im so so so sorry for Jaz because she worked very hard on her sculpture and it got ruined by Izzy plus Izzy won. And im not trying to say that Izzy shouldn't have won, it's just bcuz I feel very sad for Jaz. She was kinda broken but she had a big smile in her face which is very cute! Love you Jaz and others too.
I quite liked Michelle’s tbf
The swan omg
I LOVE Michelle’s piece I think she should’ve got second and I think Jaz should’ve won because that mortal cycle was SO COOL😳
fun fact michelle only got 32 balls and she only needed to do 170 so ach did his math wrong by taking off an extra 10
I love the fact that jaz smiled when she lost😮
I love them all but if I was the judge t would be a tie between the motorbike and the swan 12:52
They always have there hair match there clothes
Macency is iconic
Bro Mackenzie is so underrated why was hers last it was better than the alpaca in my opinion
For me  it would’ve been the alpaca last the gorilla 2nd last the swan 3rd the mother cycle 2nd and owl 1st
i feel like the alpaca should have got eliminated first
Jaz is the best one here
Melendez said Twerk
i’m on my brothers phone lol
Lol all girls so it’s far 🤣🤣
I like how their hair matches the colour of their clothes
IZZY  PATNER  WAS  FROM  PAKISTAN I AM  FROM PAKISTAN
Zack one day you need to make Jake Mckenzie's subscriber cause I think that'd be so funny
izi
Ahmed’s reaction was so boring like he all ready rich
Michelle's swan was so good!
I’m not trying to be rude but has anyone noticed that Zhc is really rude to Michelle. I feel bad for her. I wouldn’t want to be with someone who is very rude like Zhc. Michelle is a beginning artist and Zhc is always rude
you should do plastick art if you havent
I hate izzy for doing that to jazz
8:01 😂
I really wanted the motorbike to winn😭
I really like dirt bike idea cuz my brother has a dirt bike I write it sometime with him and I'm not kidding JK I'm not kidding
I like Michelle’s
I am whith izzys team Izzy vin means I vil be very happy
Everyone helps cute munchie
The colourful hairssss 💜💛💗🤍❤
Me: jake is mad   Jake right now:🤬
Viv's not very good compared to Michelle and Michelle's wings are more real and accurate than Izzy . Izzy's not very good it's clumsy
btw i am also from pakistan
no ites makinzy
i onestly think michelle or mackenzie shuold have won
Michelle's art was good... i mea n , she is not the best out there , but I hate it when zach eliminates here the first when she honestly does not deserve it....  the best part of her is that she never looks disappoint even after that
Zach: what do you do on girls night? McKenzie: ride in a car with the windows down  Izzy: bathe in the blood of our enemies q😈
i ship makenzie and jake😊😊
Girl power!!!!?
can you make this again only with boys AND WITHOUT CHALLENGES
I miss when you guys painted iPhones and stuff
Omg who else ships kenzie and Jake  omg there so cute together
Why are the subscribers never excited 😒
Hi I also thought  Izzy’s gonna win and there  gonna lose the second and the third and the first
I love it in the style her hair is so pretty
Is it just me or do they all look like power rangers!!
Izzy
I don’t really like izzi
Ahhh yes, girls night is all about BLOOD SACRIFICES USING THE BLOOD OF OUR ENEMIES!! FEAR USSSSS

Izzy  shouldn’t have them on hers was the worst

I really think that Michelle was really good i think she should of won but congratulations to izzy
Every girl has different hair colour 🤣
Ok, how did Michelle get last place hers should of lest gotten 2nd
I want u to do a challenge in a video and do not tell the ppl whoever loses gets $5000
I realize thier hair color is the shirt there weraing
Honestly I don’t think she should have won
Pakistan zindabad Pakistan zindabad 🇵🇰❤️
I’m sorry but jazz should of won
5:03 thats what she said
Michelle keeps getting better and better❤
Its a great video but you like say some things to Michelle like comment her not in the nice way and you laught with other girls I would have left the video and you make her always lose
The fact that they all have different haircolours
its so funny because every one has a different hair collour  hahaha
I don't  know why  mecensy  said jackybooboo
Who else think Mackenzie and Jake are like a fighting couple
*”I’m different.😉”*
( before reading this comment let me tell you no hate I love the videos of and) I appreciate the work of Zach and the girls but just that aluminium is non biodegradable and it stays on earth for more than thousand years just like plastic. So please try to keep it for as much minimum use as possible.
MICHELE IS REALLY IMPROVING
CAN I JUST SAY UMM micheal only got emleted bc the rest had bbiggeer art ( not a hate comment )
Jaaazzzzz is super sweet
I am missing Jack 😔
Why does every time you call a subscriber and you say you can win up to $5000 they just say cool like what 😮
5:40 women hahahahhaha
Why do I love the beef between kenzie and jake😂😂😂
Done
I think that Michelle should’ve made the cut
I think Michelle's was nicer than Izzy's but Izzy won ( no hate)
Their hair colour and their hoddie colour is same🥰
Lol is it me or some of these video calls with the subscribers are awkward??
Why is Michelle always eliminated first like this video her piece was actually good but they eliminated her first and it's so dumb
One Fact: Michell always let others win and do fun😊
McKenzie should’ve won
Izzy’s thing was a lot of those rods, should’ve been deducted points
“I’m really good at catching them balls”💀
I feel like McKenzie and Jake like each other
I love the cooler themes there so cute
I ship McKenzie and jake
Poor Jaz
Mckenzie should of won
Michalle has always been the first one to be eliminated
ALL GIRLS WOOP
THE GIRLSS🎉🎉🎉
mekenzie and Jake should be a couple
Go Izzy
viv should have won
I am from Laredo Texas
The guy who won 2000 dollars is from Pakistan and I'm also from Pakistan 🇵🇰💜
I hate Izzy she always wins
michelles was litterally the best one, she never wins? it was the best out of all of them. mitchelle did great
I am one of you subscriber  zhc 🇯🇲😍😍😍
I am one of your subscribers I am from Jamaica Dominic
hi
I felt michelle's art was the best  :)
the owl looks like hedwig!!!!!!!!!
Did anyone else notice that all of their hair matched their outfits
Viv’s art is so creative tho.
I love zhc crafts and everything it improved me so much I turned to an artist thank you so much to the whole zhc team I subscribed liked and done everything
i bought it any way
are you kiding me the hoddie is 53 pounds
Izzy’s one didn’t have much detail, I find Michelle’s and Jazz’s one the best
We all already know what Ben would’ve made! Lol! (✨🐉Dragon🐉✨) I think Kennz is gunna win!
Jaz should’ve won thb
I love all of them masterpiece or art it is lovely, nice, beautiful and talented
Michelle’s swan was so good! Wtf she should have came at least 2nd
IZZY ONLY WON CUS ALL OF US ARE POTTERHEADS
Im here because want to see kenzy may best favorite artist ,hope to mentioned me
Ben and Jake they have to be there🙁😟
v
why does everyone roasts Michelle!? Michelle is just on her own way bro
The fact that I'm flying Rn and they were making planes out of aluminium
Lol
Student how do you really fast
why is izzy such a dam bully
Mmmeow
Everyone did amazing this round and I think this was one of Michele’s better ones if only she made it a bit bigger
Everyone just votes Izzy because most people might just have a crush on her.
Viv, where were you?
Izzy is to over confidnt
Very sus
Who else ships McKenzie and jake
Whoever is reading this message Jesus loves u
Zach: 3 2 1 every one hands in the air! Me: LiKE YoU JuSt DoNT CaRe 👇😅
Hey my name is Michele
all of the girls have different color hair
I am the supplier of aluminum foil, if you need to import, you can contact me
i feel like mashel shouldnt have gottin out first
he thikkk
Ek het nou die dag so you can see the world in the world and you will be able to get a good feel for your life and your life is a must for you and your family is a great place to work and to be
That’s crazy cause Michelle had a half a bucket
No offense but I think Izzy's piece looks stupid I think Michelle should have won
Even if Michelle was the smallest, I feel like she therefore proved to everyone that big does not always have to win. It’s just that me personally I would have chosen Michelle’s as the winner it was super elegant and pretty !
I swear izzy always wins imao she’s so talented
I liked McKenzie's the best
Zach I would appreciate it if I could be in one of your videos pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaasssee
yall realise they all wearing hoodies of the same design but colours matching their hair
i hae zHC
i like izzy
Notice me ZHC
i actul love kenzies personality so much-
😊
I don't think it fair that because Michelle is zachs girlfriend she gets to be in all the videos when she can't do art 🤨
seeing a Pakistani made me soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy
Please help 🥺
McKenzie’s sub has the same name as my uncle 😂 but his Pakistani
This is amazing, I have been watching ZHC for a almost 3 or 2 years and it gets better and better. BTW to all that did the art in the vid. you girls are amazing i hope you have a wonderful day :)
Izzy`s looks like hedwig in harry potter
Niceeeee
Is it just me or Ben and McKenzie would make a good couple
Even the ugh Michelle was eliminated first, i personally think this was one of her best works, keep improving michelle !! <33
Bruhhhhhh has michelle ever won? Zach you cant be that harsh on YOUR GIRLFRIEND
McKenzie stop massaging your gorilla's butt Never knew I would hear that in my life
Lol hair maches the sweaters
Ben*
Lol poor brn and jake
Their hair matches their hoodies
VIVS WAS WORSE THAN MICHELLES  ZACH ALWAYS ELIMINATES MICHELLE EVEN WHEN HERS ARE SO NICE
Well done izzy
i feel so bad for michelle, this is one of her amazing peices and like shes always first to be out, i think her peice had some more effort then vivs, (no offense to viv ofc! shes very talented and has amazing peices, i just dont think this was one of her bests), but just cause michelles was smaller, doesnt take away from the fact that its an amazing peice, i also hate how he said "the details on the feathers look.. kinda nice" like- what kind of compliment is that dude lmao, also im not saying she should of won, im just saying i feel bad for her, i can tell that her art is getting better every video! keep up the great work michelle :)
Sup
Mckenzie RULES ❤️❤️❤️
Jake what are you guys working on today? McKenzie wouldn’t you like to know Jake. McKenzie Ieaving you on red 😂
When she hit the ball and it looks like a baseball that it remind me of the TikTok song that goes I want a picture of a baseball bat
Love how they were dressed in Color’s matchigg by their hair! It looks AMAZING!!

*I like the swan- 🥂✨*
Your videos are awsome
Nice video pretty sweet
5:37 THIS PART GOT ME DYING
Is it just me but Michelle always gets eliminated first when her piece is one of the better ones
YAY GIRL RULE NEXT VID MAKE ONLY GIRLS CAN WATCH
At 5:39 Zach is laughing like an evil witch
why do they say slime thats literally just water dyed green
I love your video’s and it is so amazing that you did a video with just the girls
I wish I could meet you I like only draw eyes I wish you were my friend 😔 💔 😞
How many times have zach said "girls"

Omggggggggg
I think jack gone win
I really really feel Jaz’s motorcycle was way better than Izzy’s Owl…. But still, amazing work Izzy!
i just realized that the lights in the back of the girls are their own favorite color lol :D
i ship jake and kenzi
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑👿👿🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑👿👿🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦
I liked vivs
First when I saw you I thought you where gonna do music.-.
I love how they are all wearing their color 🟣Jaz🔴Kenz🟡Viv⚪️Izzy🔴➕⚪️Munchie
I love these videos
Love the fact they're all dressing to their hair colors
I feel so bad for Michelle she always gets eliminated at the beginning 😢 I think she should have won bc it was really detailed and textured
i love how every girl has dyed there hair
Viv Michelle Jake Izzy Jazz McKenzie are so talented
I think McKenzie should win
You said onion rings do you mean funny rings🤹🏼‍♀️🎪🎭
Luv Jaz her BIGGEST FAN!!!♥♥♥♥
Have you noticed that there jumpers match their hair
honestly Jaz or Michelle shoulda won.
How did Michelle lose
Michelle piece was so good
go michlle nice try i love her and zack
Michelle always loses yall be saying you like it but she always in last place
i love how McKenzie loves nature and always builds animals or paints/color good job!!😄😄
Am I the only one who kinda ships jake and kenz?
I hate the girl more
Im a girl and
Zach:what do you do on girls night Everyone:rituals Izzy:swim in the blood of our enemy's
Im good at drawing mabe ko🤑🤑🤑🤑🥰😇🥳😻😻🙉
Everytime there is a math test punishment  Michelle is like:😁😏 And everyone else is like:😔😫
I can’t sleep and I’m not feeling well
Why is everyone wearing the color of their hair
Zhach:it looks juicy  Me: yo what the cluck
The war between Jake and McKenzie continues
Can we just take a moment to realise that the colour of their hair matches their top👌👌
At this point I ignore their judging because it’s always the same who win when they often don’t deserve it.

It is so funny of the friendly hatred between Jake and McKenzie.
I feel bad for Michelle because she mostly always looses the challenges
Love from India

The thing I remeber most after watchin was"balls"
I love your videos so much love from Pakistan 🇵🇰

Michele got ROSTED
It’s not  slime it’s green colour water

mckenzie just a lie because her face is red that my dog away
ZHC you should do a Carve into soap challenge
JAKE IS NOT GOING TO BE IN THE NEST Challenge

All of you guys hair match your outfits
"STOP MASSAGING YOUR GORILLA'S BUTT" i laughed the hell out of me 😂😂
I honestly thought Michelle should've at least been to the top 3
I love the 🦍 what ever it is
I wish Jaz won 🏆 😪
it’s still a Alapaka but I gave it a love hear nose, I gave it some wings, a unicorn horn and it’s got legs arms and tail 🤣
I love how Michael, sorry if I spelled that wrong 😑 but i love how she is so caring and i love how she doesn’t complain when she loses most of the times 🤩 (cuz she loses a lot but that doesn’t matter😜) back to the point 😗she is such a good girlfriend and friend,🥰 and the funny part about her she names animals of things that she makes and i love how she says Mr.Bacon its so funny😂. I love her personality😄. Michael I hope you see this!!💖✨
I liked the gorilla
I’m from Belgium 🇧🇪

Michelles piece was amazing. I don’t understand why you had to eliminate her.
I like Izzy Michelle and viv
I like how jaz said when she got slimed “OMG ITS SO COLD” lol
Is it weird that he says  artists when two boys are there and others are girls but girls when there is no boys
izzy is a savage
I really think Michelle should of won, her art was really good and realistic
I find that when IZZY is in any challange she always seems kinda mean to everyone. Like in one challange she kept going for viv?
Hhi
Jazes one was so much better
yay Iizzy😄
It is aluminium
ZHC literally always eliminates Michelle first
I think Michelle’s should have won, i don’t know the winner yet!

3000000000000000000000000000000 girls in my life
I get wanting to win but also it was so damn rude for her to go that hard on jaz piece like she knew hers was way better and it came off kinda jealous
And the hair maches with their hoodies !!
They all have different hair colors : purple, yellow,pink, white and red !!
Lokey jaz💜 Mackenzie❤️ viv💛 jake💚
michelle is like the chandler of zhc
Jazmin is my favourite girl and jake is my favourite boy and viv is my 2nd favourite girl and Ben is my 2nd favourite boy
The slime isn’t even slime anymore, it’s just colored water
Did anyone noticed everyones hair matches there hoodies 😍😍
I would have voted for Michelle
Where’s Jake or Ben????
It like  ZHC: whos most likely to kill somebody Everyone: makenzie then starts runny away from her  LOL HAHAHA ( dont kill me makenzie it was just a joke😥)
Did anyone realize that the lights behind them match their colors
I like viv
jaz is such a good sport, but we all know she was upset she didn’t win. that’s normal. her motorcycle was so good, she needs to win some. she’s doing so good but she never wins.
tbh i don't really like vivs
every comment has over 100 but mine :/
Hi Zach! I'm on my mom's account but I think you should do one of these videos but christmas themed so like only use Christmas decor or something like that! I would definitely watch it!
Let Michele win something
Whaaaaat?!! The motorcycle was hands down the best!!
I LAUGHED SO HARD WHEN ZACH SAYS TO MCKINZE “Stop massing your gorillas butt”
The owl is soooooooooooooo cool.
you should remake pancake challenge with your group i really want to see that
The gorilla was the best let's be h9nest
I love how all the girls have different hair colour
I thought Michelle did really good
Please don’t share eny of my comments in your videos
I’m not subscribed
I HATE Izzy she destroyed the artwork that Jaz  made
🇮🇳🇮🇳
Hi Zach to today I I found out I had Covid😞😞😞😞😞😞

Michelle's swam was the cutest and she should win this  I'm sad 😢
I thought that Michelle should have won if it didnt matter the size.
Your videos are just so good.
I really liked Michael's swan and I'm not just saying that to be nice I really think it's beautiful.

0:50 must be my fav part XD
Can you help me? I need a laptop for my school because my laptop is broken, I don't want to tell my mom because I don't want to make her worry. what should i do to do my final project?
Am I the only one who noticed that their jacket is matched up with their jackets

Hola
me sitting here wondering what time he films cause it always seems that people have to go to sleep during his videos
I love how everyone wears the color of their hair

Izzy and McKenzie are so cute
if I had to choose jazz was  better than Izzy
interesting
I love Mckenzie and Viv
Zhc team ❤❤❤ NE India🇮🇳... I really  wonder how u jump up hight in your YouTube channel.. I m a art lover but here we don't have support so..
I felt like Jaz or McKenzie should have won!
Izzy in Pakistan we don’t say dollars it’s rupees hahah
Finally someone from Pakistan
Zack is always at michelles side
India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I think jaz should have won her's was really good epically after it was destroyed.
Such a waste
Izzy + Mackenzie = Michelle  Get it because Izzy is white and Mackenzie is red white and red makes pink and Mackenzie is wearing pink
i have a crush on izzy now
No one Not a soul Slime=green water
is it me or Michele never wins a challenge
Izzy is my least favorite person on this channel. I feel as though she only Brings negativity and bad views to the videos
Zhc : ok ladies let me see your balls Ladies:we don’t have any you do
Current sub count: 148 Goal 157 please help me get to this goal
And your girlfriend  pink hair I love pink
Hi I like your blue hair
Their haircolors tho!❤💛💜
It's aluminium not alunamin
Idk why but i ship jakr and McKenzie
Ngl izzys was the worst one lmao
But Michelle’s was the best!
I thought I was the only one, but it is obvious that everyone can see how much Michelle has improved.  Also, how do you guys do it? Everything almost always looks good and y'all make it look so easy
I love lzzy
i love owl
i love owl
Jazz should of won
💗
Izzy is so talented
Poor Jaz. Ha jk
Ummmm why does izzy have arm pit hair????
Who  else ships micinzie and jake
mikenzie was rude to jack
Omg Michels is so good I can tell she is really improving😁😁😁
Is it just me or does Izzy's barn owl look like Hedwig from Harry Potter
This is me i swear im the only boy in my class
Next time can you do bead art?
its all fun and games until he makes air art
What do you do with all the art after you make it
You should do legos
Girls is Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob
Why do they all have certain colours which match their hair  Izzy-White  Mckenzie-Red Viv-Yellow Michelle-Pink Jaz-Purple
bruh the way Zach kept saying "balls and girls"
I think that Michelle or Jaz should've won they did so good ! <3
One question what do you do with all     The art after the video
You have so many girrrla
“Leavening him on read”  Literally

hi zach can i please be in 1 of your videos i am a great artist according to my mum
This is so beautiful
Zhc’s house looks like candy land with the colour schemes

My favourite piece was Jazz's as she did mostly every part of he motorcycle and also Michelle did amazing with her art. I really love watching ZHC as it is very entertaining and also gives me ideas for mh school projects. Keep it up Zack !! ❤ 🤩
Are these girls Power Rangers.......
Jazz should win hers was the prettiest and the hardes to make compared to izzys
Why are you making fun of jake?I I'm good at this I do it at home. All the challenges you guys do I do at home
isnt-that-wasting?
If you told him wouldn't you like to know, that's not  leaving him on read
Izzy has won the most OMG AND U SAID MICHELE WON THE MOST LOL
No jake and ben??
izzy wins so many
Why are they telling him all our girl night secrets! As long as they don't tell the enemies 🙃
I want jaz to win
I can’t believe izzy did so bad to jaz like that
Hi love your vids
In my opinion I felt like viv should have been eliminated first and then Michelle should hqve come second in the  competition her swan was amazing and a lot more detailed then Vivs art work. Vivs was still really good but I just felt like it wasn’t her best work.
My real name is Isabella but people call me Izzy
The motor bike one was my favorite.
Why always one of the subscriber are from India ❓🚫huh?? 😒
That is not slime it’s coloured water
I'm so happy that Zach included fans from Pakistan
I like your art
My favorites were the owl and the swan!
Hi
Let's go, Izzyyyyyy!!! 🤍
Yo Vincent SAC TOWNNNN
When you said "NOW" for the challenge to start I said it at the same time and said Jynx so basically u owe me $50
I like or video's and I am a big fan
I subscribed
Zk zok zaky zkzko zcck zck zuk zeek zook znk😂😂😂✌🏻
Izzy: Bathe in the blood of our enemies Me: F.... friend
A video without jake is nothing
Zach! Stop picking on Michelle! Her Sean was better than the owl and the alpaca.
Every time they said balls it felt sus
💜 💛 💖  🤍 ❤️   ….
Idk why but i steongly think michelle should have won but she was eliminatwd first😭
Zac: Girls bring your balls and come with me 👁👄👁
What Izzy she always wins
i have not watched this guy in a year. I click on a vid. I have to instantly laugh at the fact, that infront of me are 6 people, who without exception, all have dyed hair matching their hoodies
Fun creations but downvote for clickbait misleading thumbnail yet again.
the one with the bird s shuod win
Why does meshel allway lose i think meshel won
Vivs looks like a pinyata
Idk I Just Want Zach Decide, if You let then Decide They Just Gonna Choose Izzy.
I think jaz or Michelle should’ve won
BEUTIFULL COLORS
I'm late. Cheering for Viv! 💛
That’s not slime, that’s just coloured water 😂
Why does izzy keep winning?!?! Her art is good but the art of jazz was better and it even got ruined by izzy but it still looked perfect! Izzy didn't deserve to win this round 😪
Michelle is never winning
How can i be part of the show. I have been a subscriber for quite something and no clue how it works. Someone should enlighten me
I hate izzy!!
U made the subscriber win like 340k in pakistani rupees!!! U guys r awesome
"thats so amazing, i cant believe that" says it with absolute no emotion and a straight face ;-;
I think Izzy is gonna win
I just noticed they’re all wearing the same color as their hair
I felt like izzy won because she tied that bird to look like it was flying also i thought it was rude how she didn't felt bad about ruining jazs piece
Zach should do art and the artists judge him
He’s gonna run out of ideas soon, what’s next? Toilet paper art?
Sorry but Izzy!?! 😳🙄🤬🤦🏼‍♀️ That was so wrong, we barely even see jazz anymore on these and you gonna go and do her like that 🙄!?! It was just foil and you had a damn hatchet, you didn't have to also put all strength behind it too!🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ Don't worry jazz she was just jelly cause yours was so good!
Love this channel, Love ZHC Everything!!! They are all so talented and compassionate and of course entertaining to watch them work too! Just out curiosity tho.... 🤔🤔 When they do all these "mini challenges" during the main challenge, does the timer stop or keep going?🤔 I'm guessing during the burpees or any "punishment", the challenge clock is still going but was it stopped while collecting balls fountain or throwing the foil planes?? 🤔 Always wondered that! Anyways, y'all keep doing what your doing and we will keep watching!! 😁😎🥰🤘🏻
you are copying mr beast
That laugh that Zach did when Jaz did not  kick the ball Zach’s laugh is terrifying it’s so funny🤣🤣
Hello Zach, I'm from Pakistan to💟🔥❤️❤️
Love the rivalry btw Izzy and Kenz...Both are extremely talented..and Izzy's gradually surpassing Kenz.. winning consecutively 😍❤️ Also I'm from Pakistan too...so super happy for Izzy as her subscriber was also from Pakistan 🥰
And they are catching balls
Wait,girls are kicking their balls
The voting was messed up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The winner: Wow that's so amazing 😒....I can't believe that😪
nah bro.
So cute how Izzy say ”i have to go with MY GIRL.” So cute!! The best friendship!
Izzy just hits different
Where is 🇧🇪🇧🇪
Way to be excited about winning $2000 subscriber lol Jeez
Kinda thought jaz should have won
Why are u merch so expensive
Can i pls hav a shout out
I wish I could get a shoutout
It’s not a challenge without Jake 💚💚💚
Erm...Michelle deserved a spot in the polls more than viv and Mackenzie tho, her work was smaller but better🤷🏽‍♀️
Boo Izzy I love jazz
Did she went up
Istg Michelle improved af
Missed jake🥺🥺 he's so entertaining😎
IZzy always  won 😂😂
Spoil the tin foil
you all have different coloured hair
Lzzy always win but how Lzzy how?
“Slime” aka green water 😂😂😂
L sub l also a fan l hope Lizzy wins the most
Hi
The yellow haired girls voice is ear rape
It's great to see viv and jaz back!
I saw theee edit
“Balls”…..
I broke my iphone just before DIWALI I wish someone get me a new one🥲
BaLlss HAHAHAHA
Go team girls! btw nice art work ,  girls are not less than boys.
fun fact:Jake will be getting revenge soon
Come on zach, don't destroy their art. You can give them every challenge and punishment for fun, just don't destroy their art.
Some reason izzy almost always wins the challenge And michelle is almost always the one who gets eliminated 1st
I have a question to everyone.who is your favorite among the girls? For me is jazz...me and my sibling is like prayin jazz wins😁😁
👋🏼
My favorite purple hair
➖➕
You should do a pipe cleaner challenge
I think jazz should have won because hers looks so good and she got hers destroyed and came back and fixed it.
I just love their different hair colours 😍😍
Do the girls all coordinate their outfits before a shoot. Each came as their won colour. 😆
Stopped touching your gorillas butt
Can I be in the next video I just want to be in one if that's fine
How did izzy win that? She forgot the eyes those sticks on the head of butterfly, And she had like 0 detial and it was so simple compared to others
Jake and mckenzie are so cute together
You should've allowed sandpaper to be able to smooth the foil
Try to do this in the Philippines..... and you WILL be asked at all the checkpoints 😂😂😂
Most of the girls have long nails, who's next
Everyone scream alot but look at mckenzie just confident . 😉she is my fav 👩🏻‍🎨
Lol notice how all of the sweaters they are wearing match their hair color?
It kills me how the people who get called to win the money never show any excitement 😂I would have been freaking out
Why do you subscribers always sounds so sad like ……………………🤨
It is tin foil
Video idea: make a challenge for the boys only add Ben, Jake and male subs to participate.
it should be michele
Hi
Aluminum XD
Mckenizie is a cheater
You just love clickbait
hold up did just say ballschaught in 4k
let mechelle win
The part where Zach said, “You are all going to take turns kicking your balls.” 😂😂😂😂😂
You should do a challenge with kinetic sand. PLEASE!
I love that there hair matches there outfits
What is issue YouTube channel called Annabelle
Izzy always wins in every challenge that she probably lose she’s not in it
Now I know why everywhere I go and they say sold out of aluminum foil
Yo we're my girls at🌟
I love alluminam foil
2 of my favorite characters are viv and izzy
Bruh I would make mecha Godzilla
I think this is the first craft video I watched without a boy (apart from Zach)
Me asking myself what aluminium foil is ... Realising in Britain we call it alu miny um
Hey Zach, I’m a huge fan of yours🥰😘. I’ve 🔴subscribed🔴 to all of yours and Michelle’s channels. I love taking you as an idol😍. I’ve always wanted to come up in one of your videos. Love from India!!!!👋
I realised Issy is winning a lot recently
Finally Jazz is in a ZHC Video   cuz. Have not seen her in a ZHC video

I love this but why is no one talking about how wastefull his videos are
Jaz put very hard work but Izzy just destroy it
Omfg adult women screaming. So annoying
MICHELLE SHOULD HAVE WON ITS THE BEST ONE CAN ALL THE REST ARE JUST BIG AND SIMPLE
if i can make ill make a trash lol bc im very bad at it
its funny how ZHC's friends have different hair colour
I am sry but I love alpacas and llama but not unicorns
I wish jaz won because in my opinion I thought it was better than izzys sorry Izzy but still think you did a great job
"Yeah!" *Flashes red*
zhc says: subcribe if you want to win 2,000 dollars  Me: i am subed to him  for like 2 or 3 years lolol
All the girls make a rainbow
There were a bunch of gods aluminum art works

I'm from India I'm shaurya Ray
I'm really Happy they included pakistan 😊
Izzy's Owl reminds me of hedwig...
7:14 timestamp ignore
Love that it's a girls challenge!!! But I feel bad for Zach being the only boy and all
IZZY’s was the worst she shouldn’t have one I think McKenzie should’ve
Poor Michelle I would have never done that .........
DUDE WHAT?! Michelle’s was fuckin gorgeous, why tf was she the first one out?! No, like I’m seriously upset about this😂
Me not mad because Mackenzie didn’t win😐
In my opinion I think kenzies was better then jaz
Michele was soooo good
JAZ WIN >:(
Hello sir, I am a big a fan of your art works and your team 😊😊❤️❤️❤️
If I was there I would make a snowman
who else just realized the hoodie/ sweatshirt the girls were wearing was the color of their hair
Budget mr beast
Lol that indian guys that one his reaction when he wins is sooo funny
Hi I’m subbed also Zach can you reply
why is  macenzie so mean to jake
Michelle :not all balls are perfect 😂👌 Zach: aight girls, lemme see ya balls  👯‍♀️**giggles** Also Zach: so far izzy has the best balls 😟 Zach:Girls you will each take turns, kicking your balls  🥲 Mackenzie: I'M REALLY GOOD AT CATCHING DEM BALLS *ok now this is getting out of hand*
I love the part when ZHC said to kenz to stop Massaging her gorilla's butt🤣
Why they look like the Art Rangers /Power Rangers just Art versions
This was so cool
Why does everyone in this video have coloured hair?
Michelle should have won!!
hey why does zack never do the videos
Please start using sustainable material!! You had better recycled the aluminium foil!!!  So over all the waste you guys are producing. 🌏💚
JUST AS IZZY WAS GOING TO HIT JAZ’S MOTORCYCLE I GOT A COMMERCIAL
So many indians are getting selected as their "one subscriber" who can win money except for me:(
Congratulations winners 🎊
They hair matches the outfits
Jaz be like she ruins my motorcycle and she beat me
I am seeing that Zach and Izzy.. something sus
oh hey wheres jake?
Thats alot of foil paper😮😮😮
I really thought Jaz, McKenzie or Viv..   I never expected Izzy to win because I couldn’t even recognize her artwork.   Also Good Job Michelle! She’s really improving.
Why does Mackenzie hate Jake
What she said-1:52
I think Michelle’s swan was the best, how is she eliminated first?
why is it that most of the time the losers get slimed
Everyone’s hair is like ♥️💗💜💛💚
OMg Viv is making a llama I luv llama eek!
Yoooooo I totally thought Michelle was gonna win hers was sooooo cool
I sacrifice my life for Pakistan
Michelle: Not all balls are perfect  Me: das suspicion THATS wIerd
Look at mekenzies hair at 1.01
Go Izzy
Honestly jaz was better
Take turn kicking your balls out of context 101
I love how everyone's (except Ben) hair is coloured😂
Ngl michelle should've won
when u hear the word Pakistan and ur from Pakistan so u sing classic songs ;-;
did u realize in the beginning of the challenge there hoddies match there hair
Wow
UWU
Mackenzie is  savage
Michelle might just win her-(Is it the first win if she wins this?) First win.
Americans : Aluminum ,  The world : It's Aluminium for God's sake
When he said "a ton of aluminum foil" he wasn't kidding cause a hundred rolls of foil is over 2000 yards, and that's for the smallest rolls of foil.
Love your vids
I think the motorcycle or the owl won
Can you give me a iphone 12 I'm youre littest but biggest fan and I hope you to see my comment an stay safe always love you
Your challenge was very fun..!
Cc
Lol kick da BALLS
Anyone else be staring at Zach’s horrible spray tan 🧑‍🦲+🍊=Zach
You are fooling subscriber. My brother was a winner in previous competition @upendr but they haven’t came back with any prize described in the beginning. Worst
First time seeing any Pakistani win from a youtuber, I'm so glad.😀😀 I'm from Pakistan too
0:33 Like a buldozer..... 🍭
I really think that contestants should get more money because like there subscribers get Thousands of dollars and the contastents get in hundred
Pakistan won India ??
aluminum or aluminium
Bruh
1:59
Alaminiom It is pronounced  Alaminiom
One thing to tell you guys is did you guys predict cause day before yesterday there was a cricket match pakistan vs India and in that match pakistan won also in this craft video Izzy won and won 2000$ for her subscriber and that subscriber was from Pakistan isn't it a great coincidence
Why do I feel like Izzy and Mackenzie are rivals
Love from Pakistan
izzy is having advantages cuz her hair is in the same color of the foils
Congrats for 4million!
The girls are so pretty I love their  hair
i love the friendship of McKenzie and jake so funny lol
Loving everything but still can’t understand why would you ask people to destroy others’ piece. Absolutely disgraceful
I feel jaz could have one
I love the owl it looks like it was from Harry Potter
You'll each take turns kicking your balls. I know what he meany but bahahaha😂       time stamp: 5:05
It girl only bc they cook and Aluminum foil is a big thing of cooking
Sacramento gang ay
When you realize Zach is surrounded by beautiful queens every day
Where can I find those beats you used?
the lights match the girls signature colour
Notice how they all have different hair color
Is jazz single ?
There's no way Jaz cannot hate Izzy after that😭😭😭
For the girls❤️❤️
Kenzie’s sass to Jack in the beginning tho..
I love that she is different
You can tell that Jaz had 6 brothers and I love that
I honestly thought jazlyn would win
In my opinion I think Jaz should of won
Dude, I hate his challenges! Like maybe give them some thought beforehand! I love that he factors in art in his vids, but the challenges literally make me cringe. They're downright RUDE at times! They're not cool at all, they're not funny, and most of the time they're completely irrelevant to anything.  It's just him holding his power over people so he can flex his damn ego.  Like make the challenges actually relevant to something at least....this dude is just a Mr. Beast wannabe that sucks up to people w/ a lot of fans to get views.  It's such a shame, he and his team are sooo talented with their art, like, they're AMAZING!  I just wish he did things a little differently.  I can't even watch these videos because it makes me cringe from how he acts because he has money and he just wants people to do stupid stuff for money.  I love Mr. Beast because at least he doesn't let his ego go to his head like this guy.  I have so many ideas that would actually help this guy gain subscribers/likes that aren't so demeaning to people...if only he actually read his comments because I would love to share!  Otherwise talent is just wasted.  I can't watch his videos anymore.  I'm sure plenty of people feel this way too
I hate this vedio mckenzie is too dumb
I always wait to your vlog sir keep safe always ❤️❤️❤️
I love the videos when izzy is in it .....and the video becomes more special when izzy winsssssss......i love izzy soooooo much😍😍😍😍😍😍
I hate Pizzi she too mean jaz  is the winnerrrrrrr 👿
I love the motorcycle
Viv really tried
I think I'm very bad in art😐
7890
Hii
Michelle is just loser she didn't win even a single challenge
My opinion jaz should have won the challenge if the voters knew the flash back of what happened....do anyone agree with me
Belgiummmm
is anyone gonna notice that all their hairs are dyed and all their sweaters match their hair color
get zhc to 5 mil on this channel for a giveaway guysssssssss
That was some damn hit there Izzy
Aloominum
This is awesome!
PAKISTAAAAAANN
I liked the most Jaz and Izzy so im happy that Izzy won
Tbh I think Jaz should have won

Mackinzie's *yeah!* made my day
I like how zhc is always posting videos they more frequent than other channels

So much balls
I'm sorry but, how many times did Izzy won? 🙃😕
So many balls😩
Jaz should of won
jake and mckenzie? 😌
Jaz's art - the best Viv's art - cute Michele's art - tiny but pretty good Izzy's art - creative, smart and always different in one or the other way McKenzie's art - almost the best one out of all  Let me know in the reply how you would describe their creativity😜
Sacramentooooo
Daddy just
How much money do you spend on every video
You won 2000 dollars dude, show some excitement ! :D
i wonder what day i die cuz  i wanna die
scorpion has poison but i love blood but BBGUN ammo aka BB BULLET make a injuries that were not that hurt as paint ball paint balls still sucks cuz it doesn't have a good design like BBGUN
you should try to customize a BBGUN put attachment on it and paint it would be good
owl have long legs if you get their hairy legs up yeaaaaaa
I want to see ZHC drawings 🥺😞..
ZHC. Its only girls doing art in this vidio Me. Every one’s hair is colerd?
Do you mean... tin foil?
I subd
i hate how almost every time he picks anyone but michel like this time hers where good  and Vivs wasn't

Izzy won because almost all of the voters were haikyuu fans.

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
3:02 Nice! Belgium!! Me too :)

I don't get notifications for your vids
I love how you guys just enjoy while doing ZHC's never ending challenges. Love your vids and I'll never get tired watching you guyssss ❤️
Wow❤️‍🩹
ZHC, this is not fine! Have your friends truly chosen to dye their hair in different colours that match their clothes? They're obligated to participate in challenges whose purpose is to make ''entertaining'' content for your audience. This is YOUR channel, but now you're having others creating art and you set rules. I think your friends are hurt. You made them get into your fountain with a poor excuse and have them staring at a lamp that matches their ''official'' colour. Izzy nearly destroyed her friend's piece and even won!!! They got covered in slime for 500$???? You can't sacrifice everything in the name of your idea of success. You give subscribers thousands of dollars, so more people will subscribe and your friends face the concequences. You take advantage of the fact that you have money. That's not humble. I believe your crew is even capable of deleting comments. It's problematic that I haven't come across ONE comment that adresses this. I wonder if you would like to be treated like that. I believe you can fix this, you can change this, but you first have to realise you don't have to prove anything to anyone.
I subscribe to all your videos but I’m always late too late Because video I found it or I find it sometimes two months ago one year ago three months ago why why do I always always come late
The fact that everyone has different hair color 💀
jaz's was so much better
My personal favorite is the motorcycle
I love your videos and what you do for other people.❤✌😊
Jazz is so pretty!!
I am from India
I now hate izzy😠

Feel bad for jaz😭
errr remember when young adults had aspirations of curing diseases, making the world a better place, saving animals . Things parents could be proud of. Now it is so sad humanity has turned into playing with foil...like toddlers.
I Hope next time a Dutch Person is in the Video as a subscriber xD

Why am I hearing foyel
Zach’s laugh sounded like a sound effect when the vid was in slow mo
The variation in hair color is the first thing I noticed

Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
I think jaz should have won and she’s actually good at throwing stuff in buckets to win more money for the subscriber
Are jake and Kenzie 👧🏼 Friend and 🧑🏼 Friend are they mushy 😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😚😚😚
I am subscribed on my computer I am commenting on my moms phone love your videos
Michele really improved really giving next challenge winner vibes🌋
Wtf is this crap in my newsfeed
Don't be
I don't mean to be rude, but I just personally think Jaz's was a lot more detailed and better structured then Izzy's. BUT I still think Izzy did great and I was rooting for her since the beginning and glad she won  :)
Am I the only one that thinks that Izzy kinda reminds me of Luna lovegood!
I Believe that the Artist 🎨 JAKE is going to WIN 🏆 🙌 the ART COMPETITION
Did anyone notice that everysingle one of them has a different colored hair
pog
Good Job Jazz🔥, You made it to the finals. Love You😘. Win or Lose I'm in team Jazz🙌💖
NDL
So much “balls” for what
😐omg so amazing😐thank you😐
No one cares get off the internet
sud sc ribe to zHC and like
staceys pink hair is so pretty
They probably should be wearing gloves and respirator.  Aluminum sickness is real.
Hey um I met you at New York and can I be in your video ples
If Ben isn’t in it I’m not watching.
Bruh can you just stop giving money to your followers and give it to your friends, your videos are just boring now
I love Michelle’s piece so much
All of there shirts are the se color as their hair
They all have different coloured hair
WoW
Micheal always gets out first
Jaz built different lol
14:37 Michelle looks traumatized 🙈🥺
I really love Michele’s piece. It’s beautiful!!
piggybacking off mr beast i see
What my opinion is that Michelle is improving and second of all I think Jazes motor bike was what I thought would have one. Because Izzies isn’t very molded well her owl is good but it can be improved. Jazzes is very detailed as well as taking a beating and having a speedy recovery. She has also needed to do a lot of challenges and lost like the burps and staring at the purple light.
why is michelle always the first one out-
Why is Izzy always winning
I think they all looked good👍🏻
a flying owl dont they all fly
Really good at catching em balls   -Mckenzie 2021
how come izzy always wins…:
Why’s Michelle’s so underrated?.?

Viv

Hi I love your vids
Why is it always Michelle who gets eliminated first uh
Why does he always eliminate Michelle??? Is it cos he doesn't want to get hate when choosing his gf as winner. The Swan actually looked rlly good. I love ur channel though 💓
Very real day
First time watching. Complete copy of mr beast???? Editing, choice of fonts, everything.
14:25 look at Michelle’s face 😜
Poor Michelle she never wins
Where do u put the art after the challenge???
How like BTS or BACKPINK
Bruh how do these guys even know what they wanna make at first I'd spend the entire time thinking
I love how all there hair matches the sweat shirt
where is mr brokoli 😔
sorry but i don't really like izzy. she's kinda meaaaan
The way mickenzy said yeah that’s how you know she was being sarcastic
No jake no see
I’m Pakistani
Am I the only one that's kind of upset that they spelled 'Hasnain' as 'Hasmine'? I am Muslim and my name is misspelled all the time so I get upset when I see others names getting misspelled
A Disgraceful distraction
dude Izzy is so annoying
My birthday was yesterday !!🥳
I really need a phone for school and I was wondering if you could customize one with turkey and his friends and give it to me I'm fine with any phone  I'm subsribed
My minecraft username is aluminum lol
Why is it always michelle to eliminate 😒 the swan really stood up this time its layering and detailing was fine
EVERYONE LOOKUP "Gematria Effect News 23"
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in Crypto as it's retracing....BE WISE
Why did you choose that Pakistani guy 😭
done zach please choose me
ZHC is SUS😂
The shade coming from Izzy… 😂😂

I honestly really thought Jazz would have won and Michelle would have come 2nd but I love how Jazz kept smiling through it all
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved
The fact that all of them have colourful hair its a rainbow
I’m getting a Chinese mr beast vibe
Where do you put up the polls for the voting?
This is the earliest I’ve ever been to a ZHC video and I’m so excited to be part of the notification squad! I hope this new YouTube endeavor doesn’t heavily effect you regular upload schedule. I really enjoy your content man; I can’t say it enough. You’re my favorite Tuber of 2021!!! Keep up the great work my dude
“It’s a girl challenge today”  ZHC standing in the background
For one challenge you should do an acrylic pour challenge, give them like 10 canvas and like 5 hours to do abstract or real things. Then let it dry and come back the next day and judge. Longer challenge but I just like acrylic pours
I love how every one in like the "zhc squad" has like their own colour   Zach:teal Michelle:pink Viv:yellow  Izzy:grey/silver Mackenzie :red  Jake:green  Jaz:purple  Ben:Orange   Sorry if u spelt anything wrong I know I probably did
I feel so bad for Jaz. She lost the kicking the ball challenge the airplane challenge her motorcycle got destroyed and she lost for me she Won🥺😂
The Girls: "We PeRfOrM DeMoN RiTuAlS!" Zach: "You know, i think i'm gonna play basketball."
I love how they all have different colours; they even dye their hair their colours!!
Can we all agree that when He uploads our days get better! 💖
I'm really attracted to Michele's piece. I can see that she really is improving.
Could you pls send me a Nintendo switch if yes I will  sub to all your videos
Izzy's owl looked really nice , it's eys detail was super cool
You could do pumpkins next time for halloween
I fast forward just to see the finished product.

All of us have broken Gods moral law the Ten Commandments we are guilty before God but two thousand years ago God sent his son to die for our sins in a court of law if your guilty and someone pays your fine your free to go that’s why before Jesus died he said it is finished the debt of mankind has been payed for put your trust in the saviour now and repent of your sins.

Umm idk why izzy is the one who is winning literally each challenge!!!!!!viv's and jaz's was soooo good  No offence obviously but what I felt I said And if this keeps on going like that then I am certain izzy is gonna be the next craft queen
McKenzie is a mood
I have subscribe, copy linked and liked
Wow
So creative 😂 good job team
It’s sounded so weird when he kept saying balls NGL 😂
😭😭😭I'm late noooooo
Can you please send me a ps5 and i am a subscriber
Michelle's was sooo good tho
I feel bad for jaz how izzy broke her motor cycle and when jaz run I cried in my bathroom it was so crying I feel really bad for jaz
Yes just yes 2:00
I laughed so hard when they got slimed
Izzy is like on a winning strike she wins all the challenges she even wins the little challenges in the videos like furthurest 2 throw
Lernen Sie Brasiliens Macht in Südamerika kennen | Militärische Top 10 der Welt https://youtu.be/U98VbPD9_YY
You are my favourite youtuber
Izzy might be the next artist who wins like 5 crafts challenges in a row well done Izzy!!

5:39 that laughter. Omg I cant breath watching this
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING !!!!!!
I love making things with thin foil like i make a ball
Wow 🤩
hi
ILOVEYOU IZZY!!
🥞☃️☃️☃️
,
Your the greatest  youtuber out there and your my Idol
YOU ALL ARE SO ADORABLE <3
Tf I'm sorry but Izzy's one was the worst (still good but not better then the others)
Proud moment for india
WOAH SO COOOOLLL
So that's why my Hogwarts mail didn't reach me
Nice click bait
Michele really is improving
all 40 year old racist indian people start to swarm with hate
I hate that you eliminated Michelle!!! She made it beautifully and just because an art is small doesn't mean it's not good. Plus I did not like the idea of Izzy destroying Jaz's art piece. Jaz had done it beautifully and the way Izzy just destroyed it..is not done at all. I didn't like Izzy's attitude saying"You give me an axe and expect me not to use it". I just will hate her for my life. Even though Izzy made it nicely, Jaz had done better but Izzy just destroyed her chances to win..It's just not sportsmanship.  I don't usually write this much or even give a dislike but you guys deserve it.
The entire video i was dying from his pronunciation of the word aluminium its alu-mini-mum         Americans *sighs*
5:45 Zach's laugh over here is soo evil HAHAHAAH 😈
I always love izzy she is the best
i miss jake and ben
Please suprise me also 🥺
Purple hair is sexy
Video idea- You can make best coconut art wins  Do not tell them what they win and give them at last after announcing the winner give them custom MacBook  And looser has to stare at coconut for 3 hours
“Bathe in the blood of our enemies” 😂💀 definitely love Izzy 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
RIP MY MOTORCYCLE 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Am i the only one who doesn’t like izzy she annoys me so much as much as I enjoy his videos she just annoys me her art was good. but come on the motorcycle or gorila were a lot better than that owl . I love ZHC but she just makes me not want to watvh his vids reminder this is just my opinion  .
Lmao they look like anime girls, their hair matches their clothes
The rock when they mention balls:🤔🤨😤
Is it me or is there something going on with kenz and jake?? Some sort of tension maybe??
'kick your balls' thats what he said hahah
I am here only for Isabella Addison...❣️❣️
All of those people 2:56 have a harder time with their english  accent but here i am Living in denmark and having SUCH a bad accent
I don't think the "losers" should get that bad punishment like they don't deserve it. Their arts were all really good and just bc it was not better than the other's it doesn't mesn they need punishment like they did literally nothinh wrong for the punishment
is this you getting caught here u sound like him https://youtu.be/HUYqN-yTURw
Izzy is gorgeous bro 😍
Poor little Jackie poo already has phomo  -Mckenzie 2021

Izzy is so pretty ❣️
The fact that all! Of them are ruining their hair by dying it! Dying you’re hair is really bad for your hair cause it can cause chemical changes in your hair. Did you know that it also caused cancer for laboratory animals!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
why were the girls aredy over zhc why and the boys were at there housees
I just love it when the notification pops up 'someone liked your comment' or "you got a new subscriber" it makes me so happy✨
this a wanabe mrbeast
"We bathe in the bloods of our enemies" further proofed when they blur out the pool at 10:26
really think jaz should've won, just me?
Can you say hi to jaz she is my favorite
You dumbo, Michelle’s was the best
Love the fact that there hair matches their hoodies and the fact that all their hair is died! lmao
omg the way you say aluminium. i am Australian so i say it very differently lmao
I liked jaz but I felt that she had a couple of like dents in it once I saw the picture, but now that I’m seeing the video she actually did a really good job counting the fact that it was destroyed an hour prior so if I could I would fs switch votes
I like u izzy
1.Izzy 2.jazz 3.Michelle  4.Mackenzie  5.viv
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Zack: wait, aren’t airplanes made out of aluminum?  Me:$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

It is a bit annoying when you mispronounce aluminium

⬜◻◽▫️❔❕
Hi ZHC, Michelle & Team,   I’m sure in the past I have come across a few of your videos not knowing who you were just like Mr Beast & his team. Only in the past few months I have since sub’d & been binge watching yours & Mr Beast videos. I’m here in Sydney Australia & this year has been been quite a rollercoaster. I got pretty sick earlier this year, bled out in hospital, was operated on & transfused 32 bags of blood, the doctors did not even know if I would survive, I had to learn to walk again & was finally discharged all after a total of almost only 6 weeks (April 19-May 28). Since then I’ve been home continuing to recover, living through a previous almost 3 months lockdown & online classes with my 6yr old. I don’t know how I would have survived my stay in the hospital without my strong husband & supportive brother continuing my son’s schooling routine while I was in hospital & just the general desperation of wanting to recover as soon as possible so I could get home to my family & make it before my husband, sis & bro’s bdays (June 22, June 11, May 28) & coming across your videos which used to be suggested videos to me because I had started watching Mr Beast. Being given a 2nd chance at life I’ve felt my love for creativity renewed. I lost my voice for a while due to being intubated in the hospital but since then have slowly exercised it back to almost full singing potential which I post on my channel & tiktoks (when anxiety of being seen on camera doesn’t get to me). I used to draw a lot when I was younger which stemmed off into more of lettering & I like all different crafty stuff which I post some photos on my facebook art/craft album when I learn something new. Sorry I’m babbling… I find you & your team insanely creative & talented. I love how you customised cars, houses, a school, hospital & gadgets. I bought my 1st and last ever MacBook about 7yrs ago when I finished up with my job (who were bought out & moving elsewhere) to have my son. It’s served me well as I help my dad with his online Bible School ministry, my own online studying & attempt at an online business for a while & then also my son’s online schooling whenever we were in lockdown & trying to work on my own channel. If I had gone back to PC it would have not lasted more than 2yrs with all the stuff I need to do with my MacBook. I’m inspired not only by you & your team’s creativity in customising these things but by your generous heart to others in the community. Helping to pay off medical bills, gifting aspiring artists stationery stuff, phones & computers especially to learning centres, schools & student aged people to further improve their studying experience. I’m hoping that even the random people you bump into in the street truly appreciate what they are gifted by you guys because gadgets of any kind, not just Apple are not easy to come by when the younger generation seem to think we live in a disposable kind of lifestyle & can just throw away something because it’s not the latest or most famous brand. My mac is older than my 1st grader son & my iPhone is my husband’s handed down because well, these things it’s really expensive & I don’t work anymore to be a stay at home mum. I didn’t know these things could be customised & I’ve been really curious about drawing on my Mac. I have nothing to lose since it’s old & it looks fun in your videos. I miss the feel of peeling off the plastic from brand new gadgets & when you emphasise it on your videos OMG satisfying peeling ASMR!!! Waiting for my son this morning to wake up from school I watched your video for Bella Poarch & I love the Mac you customised from her original ideas (I’m from the Philippines too!!!) except I’d probably swap out the ice cream for doughnuts with sprinkles mmmmm! I love your little cartoony characters & your art challenges for your team with fitness or sabotage punishments. You must go though quite a shampoo & body wash supply too if you keep sliming the losers. Yes I understand Michelle’s jealousy about the girl from BlackPink (I sub’d to Michelle too after watching the Pink house video, the shower mural is way too funny!) & I too wouldn’t want you to have personal stuff with that girl’s face on it (Sorry I don’t follow BlackPink or know their names, too busy knowing kiddy shows & stuff my 7y/o likes which is forever Lightning McQueen & recently Among Us). I would love to buy & wear yours & Mr Beast merch but it’ll have to wait for now til things are a bit more manageable. I will continue to watch your vids. So much so that my son who is sort of limited in speaking is memorising yours & Mr Beast’s team members’ names hahaha! We’re probably responsible for quite a few of the views count because yours & Mr Beast are just playing alot on our tv sometimes as background noise while studying/drawing/lettering or actually rewatching videos. I don’t know if you’ll read this or not but I just wanted to put it out there how you guys are quite an inspiration & I hope & pray that you guys continue to do what you’re doing especially in a time like this where we live in a pandemic we need great content & simply great people that can lift our spirits & be a great example & inspiration all around.
The winner was like “that’s so amazing 😐”
IZZY HAS THE MOST WINS!! SPREAD THE NEWS!!!
It though Jaz was going to win tbh😂💕

Oo
I am subscribed
You artists are so cool!!! Teach ussss!!! Oh wait you dropped this!! 👑!! There you go~
Like your  videos
Jaz deserve to win  she got her piece broken Izzy got 2 or more advantages
For one challenge you should do an acrylic pour challenge, give them like 10 canvas and like 5 hours to do abstract or real things. Then let it dry and come back the next day and judge. Longer challenge but I just like acrylic pours
The swan was really pretty :]
i love the fact that they all have dyed hair and their hair matches their shirts 😆
It is funny that the girls are the ones who are doing it because people say girls cook for the men just saying no Offense
Me please
I can't wait to see the art
3:02 omg Belgium! Im dutch🙃
My childhood 🥺😢
hahhahah balsss
Did you know, it is like you have colors for people? Jazz purple. Michelle pink. Izzy white. McKenzie red. Jake green. Ben orange. Viv yellow. Zach teal. Ha Ha!! :D each one wears there color and has that color hair except for Ben. Weird
I feel like its kinda mean that michelle is always losing even tho her are peices are amazing
I’ve never seen a YouTuber with contestants in a challenge have different colors! I love it
I love that you put just as much effort into this channel as you do for your main channel… that shows some dedication!!
What kind of markers do you use in your videos? I want to start customizing things like you and was really inspired! Love your videos! <3
keep uploading
Why the people that winn is so sad/not caring?
Zach: Whats girls night like? Izzy: We bathe in the blood of our enemies Me: Yes Izzy... yes
You might’ve already done this, but you should do popsicle stick art!?
Why don’t you do a pumpkin carving contest next Zhc?

Pov: my dad when i use a small peice of foil: UR WAITING ITS EXPENSIVE  Them using like sooo many packs of foil
They where all so good !!
Every challenge I wonder, “how are they gonna make art out of this?” And they somehow make beautiful pieces of art!
I am poor man
Zhc : ho has the best balls   Me : sus  Zhc: shut the f’’’ up

This is not fear the subscribers cannot judge the detail only in pics  Plz bring a judge or do it by ur self next time

I’m happy someone from Pakistan finally won!!!!🙂🙂🙂
I feel bad that he always eliminates Michelle first when she's an improving artist 👍
Izzy is catching up to Mckenzie’s wins
Hahahahaha love from Pakistan
In my opinion this round was just not right this round either Jaz or Michelle should have won , I think it Halfly counted on the size but this round just no- BUT CONGRATS AHMED , PAKISTAN ZINDABAD!! 🎉🥳
still love you viv!!
Okay i'm sorry Izzy but- I really wanted Jaz to win😅    But good job Izzy!😁😁
in the end it was india vs pakistan
I felt extremely bad when Jaz has lost the challenge. I thought that she would win but Izzy  ruined it all. But I am proud of Jaz that she has made it till the end even after getting trolled.
1:54 Michelle and Zach are sus
I love viv
Omg finally a pakistani.
I ain’t trying to be rude but michelle shouldn’t get eliminated first in every round I mean  Her swan was so pretty , and it was so detailed

hi
Καλήμερα
"not all balls are perfect" That's what she said
I liked seeing Mackenzie’s gorilla it was symbolic to a real gorilla but I knew it was not gonna make the cut never the less I did love seeing Jazz’s motorcycle though with the exhaust pipe
I think Jaz should have won because her's got destroyed and she only had 30 min to fix it
I like how everyone has different hair colours and have matched their hair colour with their hoodies  ✨I M M A C U L A T E✨
I feel like Michelle should've won. Hers was really nice
"Whenever you feel useless just remember that White Pencils like me exist."  -White Pencil
Try best pumpkin carving wins $10,000!
I liked Michelle’s swan and McKenzie’s gorillas more izzy’s is so creepy I just don’t like it

I love how their hair matches their sweaters
I know its kinda basic but you should do a video on pumpkin carving for Halloween
Pink ❤️Green 😘😘😘
does it really have to be big to be good
Idk how but izzy always wins if i watch a video i can tell izzy is gonna win no fair
Mackenzie is actually so toxic 😆poor jake 😮‍💨😪
All of you are so creative ^^
dude if i took one peace of aluminum foil my mom would kill me
jaz; im different         pls dont put that in  zack ; editor put that in

Michels was soooo good and detailed Viv’s was just messy
i cant believe Michell was out first she was my second fav after izzy but i think viv should be out first
I love how they all have their own colours and die there hair that colour  Jazz is purple  Viv is yellow  Michelle is pink  Izzy is white  Mackenzie is red Zach is teal  And Jake is green
Are you keeping the house pink???
U should do like a rock art or like cookies or something

I am Pakistani and seeing a Pakistani in their video made me really happy and when izzy won for him i was even more happy I literally screamed lmao
Hi Zach I was thinking would I be a good YouTuber I have some design but I don't know if I could be a good YouTuber can you me advice please

I thought Michelle would win
I rlly recommend using sand paper so it will be smooth :)
I LOVE YOUR VIDS 😊
they call from which app
Im waiting for my call😂😂😂😂
Day one of seeing if zhc will heart my comment
All of their outfits were matching their hair lol
I wish I got 10 dollars every time they said aluminum
I wish sabotage would stop. While it does train to get back from a mistake or other type of thing, since they are contesting, I feel like it's a mega disadventage since the person getting sabotage have to redo stuff instead of continuing like the other.
Michelle should have won
Nice video like it
Honestly I think Jaz's was the best but the rest were really good too
I think jaz deserves it more than Izzy, but congratulations to all.👍
Yay finally sub from pakistan won.

No one literally no one Zhc:  ALUMINUM Me :  ALUMINIUM  Crying out of my English 👀👀👀
Uu girls 😏
Every 5 seconds you can literally say “ that’s what she said”   Had me laughing like hell
I absolutely can’t stand Izzy, her work gets favorited too much and she literally came out of no where. She’s Sassy, and she dresses very unnicely assuming most viewers are children. She’s also just rude.
it is also called tin foil
Yay izzy wins
OMG ZHC YOUR SOOO GREAT #LYALL!!!!!!

I think that Izzys Was the 6th place, than Mckenzie, than Viv, on the 2nd Player Michelle and the winnwr Shops be Jaz these time. Please do something with Likör  ( like Udo Lindenberg )drawing next time

I thought the losers get a aluminum foil cut 🩸 💀
does anyone else agree that zhc is really hard on michelle- i get she’s a beginner but he compliments the other and then says “ew” or “that’s kind of nice” to michelle ): i feel bad and you can tell she doesn’t feel great from it
I loved this so much 😊
Pls do bread art next

in my opinion, i think Viv should of won but that's fine. Izzy was my second vote.  I just really don't understand how the team can make anything out of anything! they are SOOO talented. It also feels like Izzy is beggining to overtake mackenzie in the amount of wins lately. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Wow 😀
Izzy one is so not so perfect
Cute stuff 🤗💕💞🥰✅😂🤩😍
jazz and kenzie's art was the best for me ngl
its been one year seans i watch you i have to change my glasses cus im cant see anything

Any Indians are there💜💜
*i really liked michelle's and jaz's piece.*
I love llamas and alpacas
I'm very surprised that one subscriber was from Sweden like me, and it was the one that Jaz was paired up with, and I relate to jaz the most!
just hi....
Pls add me in the next video
cool...
Can I cook in it afterwards???
Michelle: *to kenz* Im glad i have the crafts queen.  Izzy: *jealous as anything* Not for long
Dear dearest Americans,  You say, al-i-min-yoom Not, al-oo-me-Oom  Also it is not posta it’s pa-st-a
Everything is good but I hate when they destroy others work ... They worked so hard for it destroying that work is not fun.. they smile Everytime when their work got destroyed but it's hurts inside right? They should stop doing it. It's ridiculous. ZHAC if you are seeing this please reconsider it
Who else got excited when they saw that there's swedes that can win money
Where’s Jake
i dont think izzy shoulda won that. jaz or mckenz shoulda won that
Cool
this is so hard
5:24 whatta-
Can u please post more videos and i dare you to slime yourself i sorry 🙏🙏
for me michelle did the best aluminum foil art hehehe
Michale should have won
Zhc can make the best sculptor's
Another cool art 😍
Hi I'm Padma from  India...  Zach u  people really are great and do great challenges.. Really love ur paintings... Great work...
I thought Mckenzie wIll make a 🦁 lion
Zhc u should make it out of cake or food🥳
i think Izzy's was nice but jaz was perfect even after her art was destroyed she made it work so nicely
All were amazing.. Love u ZHC
Do cake art challenge
Cgs Izzy
My boys night we go shoot ducks and do target practise in my backyard
Hey zach just curious where is your pet snake that michelle bought in one of your video just curious
I hate izzy she is cheating or something because she has won nearly every zch crafts challange. It's not interesting to watch how she always wins just kick her out of the challange's!
Am I the only one that would make an aluminum foil ball...
The balls part got meh 🤣
DO PUMKIN CARVING CONTEST
I’m just mad that in America the say aluminium aluminum. Like what?! No hate tho
Amazing video ✨🤡🍟🤪❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨
I love you guys are so entertaining and I just can't say enough how much I laugh and how are you so talented 💗💗💗💗💗💗
Michelle should of one for me
Hi can you chose me?? I am your biggest fan
Hedwig won 😃
I wanted Viv to win she's the beast at art
Now I know why I didn't find any Aluminium foil at the store  😢 Zach!!!
Indonesia 🇮🇩 subscribers
It looked nice to get slimmed because it was basically green water
Thank you for everything you have done for me and the other amazing subscribers i love you Zach 😊😊
They are the power rangers of artists 😂😂😂😂😂👌
The international fans gotta step it up lol
Lol the colour of the outfit corresponds with the hair
They should make art out of food like best food art
Missing jake!!!😭
😎
Idk why jazz is still in zhc videos she doesn’t know how to do art I think Michelle is better
I really loved Mackenzie's art😍
Is that the color of silver?
Kick ur ball man like come on
purple yellow pink white red. U know what I'm thinking about
Do a challenge with blu-Tack
Finally another video in 2 weeks
Deymmm, Another ZHC video to uplift my day
It’s been 2 weeks since your last video. You definitely did a good job 👏
Do you give giveaways to indians
i literally think izzy wins every contest!! g4u izzy! and i kinda think michelle deserved to win!
Wow thats Hard! (Well for me)
I love ZHC. Big fannnnnnnnnnnnn
I need a video ZHC VS VIV I just want to know who is best at portrait 🤪
Just a quick question everyone who wants to be on his team has a different hair colour to match their clothing but is that a necessity? Or did everyone agree one time, like “hey, this is fun let’s do that for a video?”
All are best
Balls Balls Balls
i felt so good and i was so lmao when jazzes art was destroyed by izzy lol...i litterally liked it'

Hi
Izzy😍
My name is Elton. I'm diagnosed with DMD(duchenne muscular dystrophy) which has 85% impacted my body.  And I'm trying to raise some funds for a wheelchair accessible vehicle so that I could be able to travel anywhere I want and not to worry about my mom or dad to transfer me  If you could  help me to reach my goal it would make my life easier

hi
izzy's kinda sucked in my op
Wow Zach you are almost at 4M!
i love all ur videos!
Ashamed to say I’ve been watching for months and just realized that each artist has a set color. Izzy’s is white , Makenzie’s is red , Viv’s is yellow, Jaz is purple , Michelle’s is pink, Jake’s is green, and Ben’s is orange 😩🤦🏾‍♀️
Michelles was easily better than Viv's in my opinion.  Viv's was big yeah, but Michelle's looked so good
Zach's laugh is always beautiful  Do y'all agree?
sir bigest fan from india pls give me an ipad pro or iphone 13 pro max or mac book only  123 years old
Hi
I think jaz deserved the win than anyone today
here in new zealand we call it tin foil
Cool
Is it just me who is never early... No just me 😅 oop uhm oki bai)
Hope I be in next video ;(
Hi
Zack swore?! !
i missed this
People really be makin sculptures out of aluminum foil?!?!  I can barely wrap something in aluminum foil
I don’t understand how they are so good at art with things that are random, hard to work with, and they’ve never worked with before it’s really cool also I think Michelle’s was the best she added so much detail and was really good
I love how they all have their own colours  Jaz is purple Michelle is pink Mckenzie is red Izzy is white And viv is yellow
the way zach said ONION RINGS😂😂
It’s for the girls since aluminum foil is used in the kitchen
zhc the best
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS WITHOUT JAKE,  WE WANT ENTERTAINMENT MAN WE WANT JAKE

Hi
I m sorry to be that person but I feel like Michelle's craft was worth it for the poll (to be in the top 4). Despite being small, its not the matter of who has the bigger art piece. But Michelle's work is beautiful . But overall everyone is just so talents and crafts videos are my favorite😊😊😊😊😃😃
