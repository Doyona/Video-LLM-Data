Hi I am from the future @2024 nowadays amd is way superior than intel in power efficiency and gaming and the table has turned and intel is now forced to make their cpus cheaper as compared to amd
10:06 This is the first time watching this that I realized AMD sandbagged Zen 2's IPC vs the then direct Intel competition on this graph. AMD didn't just match Intel's IPC with Zen 2, they WELLLLL surpassed it! With it being like ≈+5-10% higher than Coffee/Comet Lake depending on the specific workload in question...  This is exactly how it had competitive single-core performance while having notably lower peak single-core boost clocks, and Renoir (Zen 2 Mobile) was able absolutely to DESTROY Coffee Lake Refresh/9th Gen Mobile despite being clocked just as far apart, if not FURTHER than on desktop.  I wonder if it was to try and make Zen 3 look more like the crazy important moment that it totally was. Aka "we were tied, but now for first time in over a decade we're the undisputed champs!". 🤷

What a mess w this generation, im waiting for the new chipsets and i've hope a better quality in the am5 platform
Thanks AMD for affordable performance.
I think this was one of the best generations of the last 20 years.
Besides destroying intel if you keep a CPU for years depending on how often use it for decent performance you can potentially save hundreds depending on your price per kilowatt compared to intel. Some places pay over 25 cents per kilowatt.
5600X GANG RISE UP!
Just as YouTube recommends this before the announcement of Zen 4.
"we're in the end game now"

She is so inspiring 💯
engineer gaming
I'm waiting to play STALKER 2. Glory to Ukraine!
Has Has Has happened happened since
When will you start using Boron Doped Diamond to create Semiconductors that will allow the creation of CPUs and GPUs that will be capable of running in the 10-100 Ghz  frequency band, and we need to keep INTEL on the back foot indefinitely.
Its a worst processer  in everything
Just bought ryzen  9
Can anyone provide any links or information as to why this is so revolutionary compared to Intel processors? Do these help boost game performance or will they help to change the way video games are developed? I want to learn more! :)
this video is kindfa bull shift lets be honest the top games they showed were already easily on high end pcs breaking over 200 fps.... the high end games did well almost nothing and thats where its needed... who da f cares if a game that easy to break 200 fps get massive gains?  i might sue amd if i had any stake in them
"We wanted to bring ......... to as many people as possible, " what a joke. She meant to say scalpers and miners
X86 is a power cobsumption that depketes more than what it delivers!
FOR AMD TO BUILD IS NICE, TO BUILD WITH WHAT WASVALREADY EXTRACTED, (RECYCLING RARE METALS)-  gold, nickel, metal, plastic, and transisters, capacitors.. etc,    then upbto market, in anbincebtive to drive your customers to recycle by means of a percentage off, goodwill-practices, and  delivering innovative tech like risc V graphene, andnor ARM!

Hey I’m not going to lie, Intel is getting beat up
I have an Acer laptop with the 5900 cpu in it and I don't use the computer for gaming, but could do that with the cpu in it.
By far the best chip sets in the market. Hands down. No comparison to that other company. AMD is going to the center point focus of my first ever computer build. I cant wait untill im in the position to build my first AMD rig. I already have the parts picked out.
I love the people who work for AMD
Do these have intergrated graphics?
Niceovideo
This is why I switched to team AMD
intel (commit suicide) AMD (beat AMD with AMD)
Dislikes are from intel fans and employees😂
Drink every time they say "Leadership "
Awareness-Might-Dominance ... AMD ... I believe AMD fits those nouns perfectly as their synonym, proving them completely! I don't mind Intel, but it was never a better option for me. And I really consider all of my personal aspects when upgrading a PC. J  I am actually and honestly better off with AMD since my first encounter with their CPU, a Duron 900MHz back in 2001/02! All in all it just made sense to me, regarding many personal factors and circumstances, yet money not being much of an issue factor, rather a logical standpoint.
It is beautiful
not worth to buy, way to expensive, simply insane
Proudly rocking this 5600X
Intel must hate this lady 🤣
F Intel
AMD has now become Intel, overpriced parts. I bought a 10th gen i5 for only £130. Nothing came close from AMD in that price bracket. Their equitant CPU Ryzen 5 3600 costed £200. Not budget anymore!
Intel : “best cpu ever”  Amd: hold on, wait a minute. Something is not right  Amd also: realises 5000 series
Gaming begins with AMD.
Lisa Su is the mom who knows online games can't be paused
I am using 5800X
Feeling good to choose ryzen as my first gaming pc and will be my go to processor
It took over 8 months for the 5900X and 5950X to be in stock at MSRP. Do a better job of getting your CPU's into the hands of hardcore gamers and the people that work hard and not the scalpers.
Intel has leave the chat.
I don't want anything else than AMD parts in my Computer!!
AMD: We present Zen 3! Intel: Hey hey hey, that's enough we're losing too much money
I got a smile when Lisa start to speak about Ryzen 9 5950x. Maybe because it is already in my motherboard's socket.
Finally the 5600x is in stock in my country, I'm grabbing it.
YES im getting the ryzen 5 5600x or 5900x
And now everyone knows that CPUs are overpriced sh**
The history zen from scratch, history of screen with clean chip the paper. Começou braba demais, meu deus a lisa é uma deusa.  We wanted disrupt the pc market We wanted bring innovation choice performance many people has  possible  After years ago , we saw that's is possible.  Compete and fight to  give all the better  The Buldozer was innovation but the market not prepared of it, now the Zen was  the great  and prepared inovation.
So when is zen4 launch?
There is a shortage of ryzen cpu on laptops though. Out of stock, not available. So disappointing.
7:53 doesn’t he look like jeff bezos
Buying a cpu has turned from  Which do I buy AMD or Intel? To  Which AMD CPU do I buy ?
PS5 🔥
i love AMD
It says that daw programs are still compatible with intel. Can you provide some explanation about how ryzen works with digital audio workstations? I am in love with ryzen for like 2 years, but I have to buy intel because of this situation. The text on the box of the program says it is compatible and works better with intel. So wht we suppose to choose?
This presentation is legendary. AMD gets it. I upgraded to the 5950X for 3D rendering and video work. AMD is making all our computing dreams come true.
Just got my newest gaming rig. Went with the 5900x. First time going AMD, and I couldn't be happier with the performance. Competition really is a great thing. Hoping this lights a fire under Intel's ass to push both of their products to new heights.
Goodbye Intel Hello AMD Ryzen
AMD YES!
Love how intel fanboys are dumping on AMD here
Ok AMD, now destroy Intel.
i need subtitle
for the love of god why i am gettin 40C idle on a ryzen 7 3800x with a Noctua cooler of 70$...dont tell me about thermal paste and instalation check, i have done it 4-5 times and i have already spend too many thermal paste cause i tried too many coolers and doublecheck each instalation...where is the problem???? bios update cheked power plan adjustments ( AMD power saver) checked chipsset and processor update checked voltage is not always on max cpu cooler run at 1000 rpm minimum my case is big and clean  whats wrong with ryzens??? i am felling that i am running a fx 8xxx  :S
AMD, cool
5600x = legend
One day, Linus Sebastian said: "Dr. Su! Please! They are already dead!"
Moooooooo cores!!!! 👻
Dont know why but Im getting goosebumps watching the intro
Finally Johnny Sins left his previous job
intel = ☠️☠️
2.8× more power eficient than the 10900k 🤣 But 2.8× more worse in gaming. I7 11700k is the worlds fastest gaming chip...from now but the i9 10900k is another legend...
Lisa Su is pog
Do not buy RIZEN! AMD CPU looks fast because they don't support many  things. Like a balloon without any load. If you buy RIZEN 5000, you have  to use Windows 10 64 bit. AM4 Does not support old versions of windows  which is required by old programs ( Which are functional as new ones). I  was a fan of AMD since K6, but I hate RIZEN!
YEAH BOI
Amazing Lisa.
I Love you Lisa; You are Amazing
Intel is dead
Dr. Lisa Su!!! stop kicking intel!!! they are already dead!!!
She is every Asians aunt    And that too is a fact
Alternate Title: how to burie Intel
1.4k intel employees watched this video Smashed that dislike button hard
The intel is not better the amd is good is very good graphics
21:47 Strange, seems Malaysia is not part of global since it is end of February 2021 (4moths later) and I could find only one 5950X not for $799 but for $1200.
Yeah .. great.. I ended up paying £1200 to the scalpers for the 5950x as there is no stock, I changed the 3950x due to instability and I upgraded to more crashes :)) I love Amd and what they are doing but come on get more stock in the stores, its not a bloody GPU !!!
They call her Lisa... not sure Lisa is a she...
Amd:zen3 (7nm-power efficient) Intel:14nm (BIZLI KA BILL TERA BAAP BHAREGA) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When will amd ryzen 3 4300g release for non OEM users
They’re too expensive honestly. Expected to be at least 50 Dollars less.
Please book a grave     For Intel
Your products is so expensive ?? And I think Intel is better than you in this time.
Well this didn’t age well.....
"wait until november 5 to find ryzen 5000 series on shelf" She lied it is almost febuary and I cant find any ryzen 5000 series on shelf
ryzen 3 1200 anyone?
Asian mum gamer leeeesa suuuu
Now they have to put the cache like Intel's Skylake iterations so they can reduce latencies even more. So 32MB divided by 8 means that each CPU core has 4MB of L3 cache, Intel only has 16MB of cache but due to their monolithic design and the layout of the cache, the latencies are very low and overall very solid.  Intel before Skylake already had shared cached. AMD is learning from them and they have TSMC for better perfomance per watt.  Watching the core layout of Zen 3 reminds me of Intel's Sandy Bridge or Haswell before Skylake destroyed them.
preferio intel
Lisa ann saved us when puberty hit and girls were gold diggers Lisa su is still  saving us from gold diggers
Can I all in amd stock?
5,7,9 .......where is 3 series  There are millions of people waiting for 3 series .I loved amd so badly because I love the 3 series . If they did not release any 3 series I am going to move on to intel...
Is that thing male or female?????
I dont care if you make a terabyte speed cpu. When are you going to make the 3300? Impress me.
AMD YES!!!
Wow 7nm is really power efficient and quite robust
Thumbs down for sure. That will be to AMD and NVIDIA, two of the biggest assclowns in the industry. Shame on you for allowing scalpers to take the majority of your cards, such blatant incompetence ;(
Please add dlss and ray tracing features to your AMD RX 6900 RT
Zen 3 on Laptop when ?
Out of stock 😑😑😑😑
She speaks the language of the gods.
16:24 Intel vs AMD
To be honest i was one of intel and Nvidia Fanboy when junior high school. I thought those two combinations would make any game become great and smooth 'WITH' cost one of my kidney or even two if that not enough. Then in year 2020 i got realised that AMD is not that bad and dont need any kidney to purchase. Even now they do comeback So i guess now i am one of 'RedFanBoi'
Where scalping begins
Is AMD good for coding?
I feel sorry for you if you game with a Raisin, get a job and then you can afford the best gaming experience, which AMD is not part of
But wait... there’s more....BUT WAIT there’s MORE.... MORE!!!!!! At a fraction of the price. Now that’s what I love to hear
Just hire an Asian aunty, the rest will be history.
Now AMD Time,Intel is now dead.
AMD is the new INTEL with 0 stock
In the past Ryzen is the budget cpu for gamers and now intel is the budget cpu
ERROR 404:  PRODUCTS NOT FOUND
Intel's 12th gen should be called: Coffin Lake
AMD was always the big leagues
AMD isn't competing against other companies.  They are Actually competing against themselves.
The time has come.. time to upgrade from this i5 2500k that i have had for 9 years. Well done AMD, I have never lost hope. Bulldozer series was a wall you had stumble across. With Zen you have risen, and I have not been this excited about CPUs since the Phenom II, and Sandy bridge days.
2020 is all about AMD. Wheater in GPU market or in CPU market
Mark looks like Tim Cook Lite 😂
SPONSOR DISGUISED TOAST HIS EX GOT SPONSORED BY INTELL PLZ
Hopefully it isn’t a productivity cpu
The dislikes are purely from intel fanboys
"other high end competing processors" me: well high end is a bit of an overstatement for intel now
Yehey all I can do is just watch
Its funny how all the Intel fanboys always laughed and flamed at me when I said AMD will be back in 2008 to 2014. All said that was never gonna happen... I was always an AMD user. Since the First k6.
Can u get pls new drivers for rx 5000 series ...
Zen 4 2022 take ma money bruhs~ Gen Z is coming
Apple M1 opened a new world Better performance in same 65W is blowing everyone's mind. The day Apple start selling the silicon out of mac is close. All this R&D in technology by intel and AMD is being questioned.

ok!!!It's been 2 month now........WHERE ARE THEY ????
AMD: *release Zen 3* Intel: *Nervously sweating and breathing so hard* AMD: But i'm not done yet! *releasing Zen 4* Intel: *die*
AMD: our goal is to give you the best The best: out of stock
hello AMD,,,, goodbye INTEL
So amd maybe trying to makr the ryzen 5 the lowest entry cpu instead of ryzen 3?
Beat the apple too.
I can't wait for this movie
AMD RYZEN™ 9 5950X Processor OUT OF STOCK EVERYWHERE! AMD just won the CPU war.
All respect to AMD I will wait as long as need be to get my ALL  AMD pc 🦅🇺🇸🦅
TEAM RED LET'S GOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!
I am still new to PC...so we're Gen 3 in AMD?
Lisa su + ryzen = ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Intel next processor technology - coffin lake😆😆😆
Amd india please stop it i cant just understand what is going on in the market we are consumers and we want things to be justified in india,REALLY HONORABLE CEO Miss Lisa Su pls pls tell me what is going on in the market i was completely waiting for your amazing r5 5600x thinking it as the budget king but what just happened we are unable to buy that all because the price it too much as expected the r5 5600x is being sold in india at  rs36000pls pls help us i am literally upset with you all pls pls look after this problem as you are my HERO
Your whole CPU and GPU launch was a complete farce.

AMD Ryzen 5600X Prices Too High In Indian Market Comparing with Ryzen 3600. And Due to Lack Of Availability Of These Processor. Some Indian Distributers Black Marketing These Processers In Very High Prices.

Su is the Redeemer of AMD Bravo👏👏👏
I will wait for zen 5..
please answer when the 5900x processors will finally appear on sale in the online store computerunivers?
Absolutely shitting on intel
brill processors..but i have just received my ryzen 7 3700X (it kept costs down and the 3800x wasnt worth the extra for the extra fps, but try to find a ryzen 9 at rrp? ) , 32 GB ram PC built by pro's but without the GPU  (cant be bothered building my own anymore and having to deal with multiple RMA's if anything goes wrong) , can i get a AMD 6800xt/6900xt anywhere in the world? nope...gutted to the core tbh..i am 53 yrs old and have been gaming since the amiga 500 lmao :) Damn the scalpers!
AMD dont show games as CSGO or something from Valve because those assholes  have servers from middle ages and  46% or 700fps or whatever fps there dont mean nothing  because game are laagy buggy stuter crashy  garbage only  !!
AMD are now dead to me after this launch.....£700 for a 6800 NON XT....F U AMD, I've been using you since I built my first DURON PC.......and have put up with your BS for a decade. At least Intel are reliable and at least nVidia openly rob you.....
AMD: Says we have 2x stocks than Nvidia but        0x0=0
AMD artist: alright new model... how can I make a circle more compelling?
What about apple's new m1 chip       Intel be like - what have I done to you God
AMD- We release our Ryzen 5000 CPUs with Zen 3 architecture!  Intel- I quit.
AMD RY ZEN INTEL FALLS
AMD is SKYNET!
The parts I've purchased for a new machine will soon reach the 30-day return policies if they do not work.  But I can't test/install them because the 5950x is constantly unavailable.  Been trying since day one.  This is insane....
rip intel and nvidia geforce
Intel has drowned in their lake, AMD has ryzen.
cpu companies must also help in making faster memories faster peripheral development to surge demand like mobile phone. only faster processor not make best pc or laptop. a pc have periferals, RAM and operating system. all must be refined at the same time.
Amd can say ezz win:))
And here we are more than a month later and it is STILL just vaporware for most
Rx570 4g rulezzzzz
"And make sure you mark your calender for November 5th to find Ryzen 5000 series on shelves worldwide."   You mean the scalpers' shelves, right?
to bad you cant buy them but there are scalpers that have 900+ in stock
Here's a novel idea...now hear me out here...maybe just maybe...have ample stock of a product before releasing it...now obviously don't relase it all at once scaplers will just get their grubby little hands on them...but soon as that inial wave hits and is over if people feel like they will get restock soon less will buy from scalpers making scalping alot less lucrative...im at the point now im about to return my x570 board and just get intel...its not that huge of a difference and anything is better than a fully built PC sitting here till half way through the gen cycle with no CPU
i'm brazilian i love hardware i like competitiveness here intel always sold expensive now we have cheap products thanks amd i always believed in you lisa su gigante
WHY ARE COMMENTS DISABLED ON THE AMD LINK VIDEO!!! IS IT BECAUSE NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY USE IT OVER THE INTERNET AND IT ONLY WORKS OVER LAN FOR MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF? very annoyed. I just want answers and maybe some help guys 🤔😕
AMD: we want to disrupt the PC market. Also AMD: Soon we also playing at mobile processor market and beating snapdragon ass.
When will stores outside of microcenter actually have more than one or two CPUs?
The CEO a women is as powerful as their Newest range of Processors. Leadership is important.👍❤️🔥
I can see AMD rising 🔥❤️👍. There is a huge improvement in the leadership
Rip intel
AMD YES!
Wow, look at that huge crowd clapping and cheering. XD
"3rd gen Ryzen" Has Zen+ (2000 series) been erased from history?  edit: Oh, I see. Zen 1 and Zen+ are now considered a single generation.
I was an intel fanboy for quite some time, and i still use i7, but after seeing those comparisons, i am joining team red in processors and GPU's, they are already doomed!
ZEN X in 2099 Laugh watching this
Lisa shows up Intel: "Why am  I hearing boss music..."
12:53 Can We trust this advertising condering that they approved this video editing?
*Rocket Lake will not beat Zen 3 in gaming or singlethread, a rumor is a 10% increase in IPC, this means that AMD is still ahead* .
AMD is nice 💪💪💪💪💪
AMD is the new Intel with high price tag, well done 😂
I'm getting the best bang for the buck, the 600 series.  The 5600 Ryzen 5 and overclocking it to Threadripper Ryzen 9 LOL
Battlefield V : -3% gain. Level of truthness ... Amd
There's no more 5000 series to be found, I'm here looking to buy 5800X can you please accelerate the production lines please! thanks.
Intel CPU & Nvidia GPU Always mate 🙋‍♂️
I’m still happy with my i7 9700k
Intel Coffin Lake 14++++++ coming soon
Dr. Lisa Su is a solid proof that Steve Jobs model still exist one way or another.
Nice launch. Scalpers bought most of the inventory. I had the 5950x in my cart and an error on processing. So I could not purchase the cpu

It's good stuff and all but who the hell cares about league of legends (I don't live in Korea and I'm not Asian) and CS:GO (released in 2012) in 2020...
Another unicorn launch
Watching this on a Pentium from 2012
Any plans for HBM APUs?...
These are so damn expensive. Just like intel, so over this over priced PC parts.
AMD YES!!!!!!!
People will love this GPU
Robert Hallock good presentation. Body language at its best. BIG thumbs up
roses are red violets are blue intel go to bed AMD has the best CPU
When the memes is with you, can't be better
Hans zimmer fan ?
I might get 5600 if it reaches 4.6ghz all cores that make vr less lagged
The engineers and support staff at AMD don't get nearly as much credit for AMD's recent successes so here's a big "GOOD JOB!" from me for the thousands of hours of really hard work.
I swear my i3 3200 2c-4t has a mutltithreated 631 c20 and the 5900x has 631 single .That's weird ...Too weird .time for an upgrade I guess
Love you❤️❤️ dr lisu ceo
I am still waiting for amd biopic.
Hail the new king, AMD
She is like a fusion of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. She's an engineer at heart with vision and focus!
AMD is the best
I might consider getting the 5900x, upgrading from the intel core i7-9700k.
AMD has been my first choice since 2004! The 8350 is still a capable cpu! I knew AMD would take over sooner or later!
AMD: *annoyed that their still on a 7nm node* Intel: "hold my 14nm+++++"
Let's be honest for a second tho, core i9 10900k runs 95w on 14nm and the ryzen 9 5900x is 105w and 7nm.. should have been WAAAAY better performance from AMD, i mean sure it has 2 more cores but honestly. i think the intel's i9 is freaking amazing for that old 14nm design.. just imagine what intel would be capable of doing on 7nm.
AMD is now competing against its own processors. Massive respect for Dr. Lisa Su.
The fact that theyre doing this on a PGA socket makes Intel's LGA socket look weak.
Will there be a 5000 series cpu around 150-200$? Like last generations ryzen 5 3600?
For Lisa Shu, everything is possible, she will change the history.  Invest in AMD and you won't regret.  Forget about financial sheet, the only element can drive a stock 10 fold is CEO.
She is the nightmare for Intel.  Basically she terminated that mediocre company!
Me watching this on my pc I bought few months ago realizing that I’ve chosen the wrong time
Proud at Lisa and her AMD team!
...we dont break it by a little... we break it by a lot... HELL YEAH !!!!!!!!!
I am sad I don't have a workload for it. Still want one though.
After this, Intel will release Intel i0-00000K which is Coffin Lake, and has Intel Inside.
We called the video the nightmare of Intel
those dislikes we're from intel engineering and marketing division
Firstly, I dont know about  this whether this AMD making people addicition to buy it or not. Secondly, how much did they did testing in AMD, i hope there shouldnt be no problem after utilizing throughout the year.  Money is not the issue. U showed the presentation and talk with the gaming ceos, how much time did they looked in AMD. Just dont say that its got more x times or whatever. We want to have consistent also. If this fail to deliver it, it will be laughing stock about taunting other competitors. Dont underestimate other competors and keep ur work consistent. All the best
Be the best
Comments are'nt turned off it shows AMD actually listens to is customers
5950x for gaming are totall waste of money !! basically with same frequency/clocks  as 5600x it will give with  rtx 3080&3090 maybe 1-5% fps  more  only
dont show stupid broken laagy stuter games in benches as CSGO!!  there fps dont mean nothing when  Valve have wooden servers and garbage updates   so 30fps on fortnite have more smoothness then 230 on csgo  (dust map)
watching it on a ryzen powered device!
Perhaps intel needs to hire  phd from MIT as well to get them back on track.  Now if AMD could just take massive market share from Intel we can ensure an incredible competitive landscape from Intel Nvidia and AMD for the next 5 years.  Lower prices and leaps and bounds in performance.  Congrats AMD its so exciting to see you guys dominate the industry again and put the 2 thousand pound gorilla that is Intel on its heels.  Like the little guy in a game boss battle.  Just awesome.  I think my next PC is going to be all AMD,  instead of Intel / Nvidia.  I hope you all grow tremendously over the next year or two and can keep up with demand you deserve it.
Can you make a device similar to the  ipod nano that can connect with usb and reproduce mp3 and mp4. I miss  my ipod nano. Its great for sports.
Respect for Lisa Su for great new graphics cards at a nice price! 👍😎 Greetings from Russia!
.
bf5 : intel would do 3% better...17:19...with 14nm+++++++
that's until intel goes to some 7 nm and we go straight back to km zero
Amd is always great!! I ran an amd hd series graphics for 6 yrs straight with 7-8 hrs of gaming daily... It only broke down coz I accidentaly removed its thermal paste of which I had no idea back then... Currently m looking to buy amd 6000 graphics in future...
Their goal to ruin your life and money 😂
*Ok* Please make it cheap. Make it peoples cpu
Intel nyimak
I am Happy to be a True fan of AMD for over 30 yrs when I started building my computers with AMD since the K6 then the K7 Athlon, and I am up to the new 3900X now, and just got the asus 5600XT 3 fan video.  I would't ever buy any intel chip, even if I do live by them.  Keep up the Excellent work.
This entire video is AMD Beating up Intel then pissing on Intel while Lisa Su  destroys Intel's personal belongings

I am sure that AMD will eventually dominate the gaming scene, but they really need a 'general purpose' software library to interface with their GPUs. Nvidia have CUDA, AMD needs something like that on the same level if not higher.

amd pricing is going so high now amd isn’t for mid class pc user
I'm just here to see what's "winning" looks like.
AMD YES！
oO
i mean, i kind of feel bad for intel. amd is just destroying everybody
Lisa Su rockin' those high heels!!!!
2021: Coffin Lake 14++++++  (6 plusses aren't even an exaggeration anymore, but accurate...)
why not X370?
I'm super excited about the innovation that AMD has brought to the industry lately. Remember that it's best for everyone when there is solid competition in the market and the most progress will come when both AMD and Intel push each other forward. Intel's got a lot of catching up to do, and I sure hope they do! For now though, great job AMD. You're killing it =)
*copied  Intel  : i'm gonna compete with AMD !  AMD : i'm also gonna compete with AMD !
Hehe
Epic Fortnite not even mention i think is crazy a lot of people still play this game they should at least consider them
Is good.
Does it have Ray tracing?
Need more news on DDR5. Want to skip DDR4 completely.
7:13
Yes yes now provide 120mb cache in the next processor
Bald guy and Asian woman banging Intel for 24 minutes straight
Intel: Lets hire 7x more people to make the best cpu ever built! AMD: Challenge accepted, so here we are! Intel: What? We literally just released the 10th Gen CPUs and you are already publishing another one? AMD: That’s one thing, yes. But we also have better power efficiency, better single core performance, we always had better multi core performance and we also have 7nm instead of old school 14nm... Intel left the Game AMD: See now? They are already dying of their heat production.... Climatic change... What a joke. Now we are at the steering wheel!  P.S.: AMD has never said anything negative about the climatic change. This was irony, if somebody didn’t understand that!
here is a joke: intel.
1:17 - Now that guy understands me!
People are saying that AMD is greedy cuzz their ZEN3 CPU's are priced higher than Intel's... are you stupid? After the launch AMD prices will drop quickly while Intel's won't (it's every year like this)!!! This year is AMD's year just deal with it :-)
lisa su iz amazing
I love AMD even my Laptop run by Intel 10 Gens
I wonder if they got hit with a demonetization like the other youtubers for using the word "covid-19" :d
not gaming related but i feel like apple was actually insightful and had made a good choice ditching nvidia back in 2015. they saw the potential of the incredible dr. Lisa su and amd. (not like apple is superior or anything) now since they are working on apple silicon it would be interesting to see if it stacks up against amd64. anyway if it fails they have the back of Ryzen. last but not least intel is really out of it!
I love your product baby
NVIDIA is next in three days time heh heh..
What about AI?
only 3 days to go. can't wait
Let’s see   5900X = $549 5800X = $449 5600X = $299  Since the 6 core 12 threads cpu will be the only one with a stock cooler it would’ve been better not having it to reduce the price and just make it a $249 price tag hmmm...
Mi cumple es el 5 de noviembre ya saben que regalarme 😉
Who else is gonna wait at 12:00 AM to buy one?
that fps is not true, not 141 vs 182,is 146 vs 166. 20 fps higher,not 40.
Intel died.
Thank you! That's what I want to say. Thank you for such amazing products! As a PC enthusiast, I'm so excited for the launch.
Intel: *Unlike our imitators who use benchmarks, this does not affect real world performance*
What happened to 4000?
When you have already released a normal, top-end video card, and not this grassroots trash that, before it comes out, is already losing to Nvidia. Or here everything is much simpler, so as not to spoil a relative's career, Lisa Su slows down the progress of the Radeon
nasip olur mu be
AMD: introducing our Ryzen 5000 series Intel: *NOW THAT IS AN AVENGERS LEVEL THREAT*
Ryzen 5 299 :(
Thank you Lisa Su and of course the engineers at AMD for bringing competition to the market, I can't thank you enough for bringing 6, 8 and even 16 core cpus to the main stream consumer market, I am more than thankful that I can get a 4 core 8 threaded cpu for 100$ instead of paying 350$.
They could make 128mb cache if they want.. but not they just want us to spend momey over and over.. its same with GPUS...
intel users punchin the air rn
Everyone knows Lisa su more than Intel CEO.
Zen is the best. ❤️
is there going to be a Ryzen 3 5xxx ?
Ok but every one in new is such a tosser. Like they are so toxic.
Looks like I'm going back to AMD after 11 years
I just want to ask, when can I see that AMD become one of sponsors in any e-sports tournament? ...or let IEM become AEM lul
Looks like she has a 7000x on her finger
Amd is like apple but more reasonable
the 1.3k + dislike are from intel fan boys
Где субтитры на русском?
Why in Poland the 7 5800X costs the 9 5900X price :(
We from India call you "Goddess" or in Sanskrit "Devi"  Thanks for making Processors affordable and breaking the monopoly.   You just created a Phoenix reborn from AMD's ashes.
Kudos to Lisa & AMD (Jim Keller too)
AMD Rising (Ryzen)...
when will the Ryzen 3 5000 come out??? Budget gamers, RISE!!
Dislikes from intel employees.
Their products really are Rise-en
Can you guys send me a RAZEN 9 plz I’m asking nicely 🥺
:(((( i just want a 3300X
but fr why tell us about the thing that is further away rather then what's closer
The asian aunty you never knew you needed
I probably missed it but what was the GPU the benchmarks were tested on?
People: Want 5.0 Ghz Me: Laughs in i5 4750s
Faster processors are still from Intel!
but can it blend?
BN vs 3080..who will win..place you're bets.
Lol, how is there 1.3k dislike?
I'm buliding my ryzen 5 3600x pc today🥺
22:30 what is the name ? Big navi?
16 cores 32 threads up to 4,9 ghz only 105 Watt. Howwww only 105 watt
AMD YES ！！！ 苏妈牛逼！！！
9:12  "Instructions per c*ck"
Amd is the best lol
So while waiting for the restock of Zen 2 laptops, why not just wait for Zen 3?
This video made me feel like I just watched a person die today. That person being Intel.  I feel kind of dirty with that second barrage of “wamp, wamp” sounds.
Fantastic news for both bleeding edge enthusiasts and people like me that are watching the price of the 3600 like a hawk.
70 mb Cache!!!! Amazing
Please insert "¡¡¡Shut up and take my money!!!" meme
I wish they would have pulled her mic ISO from the recording and mixed it for Youtube instead of using a house mix that was tuned for the room.
"One processor to rule them all..."
Next on intels presentations... 'gaming is not a real world benchmark'
Intel : I think we should bring 10 nm chips  Amd: we are planning to bring 5nm chipset by 2022  Intel: surprised Pikachu face
Lisa su!
what about budget gaming. i thought you were coming with low price amd ryzen 3 5000 series . grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. not everyone can pay soo much
I have been rooting for amd, but I really think they are jumping the gun here with their prices. If they were at or a little below intels then the clear choice would be to buy amd and would get intel buyers to possibly switch.
im not a fan of intel or AMD but when i saw last month that 10 core i9 10850k on promotion at 449 i bought it right away it a hell of an upgarade from my i7 6700
Lisa do be lookin thicc tho
Me: Buys the most powerful CPU in the market Also me: plays Minecraft
AMD: Zen 3 Intel: Coffin Lake
Lol 420k subs
I LOVEEE AMD CPU's INTEL BAD
YAAY THE RYZEN 9 3950X MY CPU,,But the bad thing is that i have rtx 2080ti nooo
6:04 to everyone that wants to see Z3N instead of ZEN~
eight core zen3 clocked to 4ghz is 19% faster than eight core zen2 clocked to 4ghz. Zen 3 is clocked about 200 mhz faster across the board so additional 5-7% improvement. Zen2 on average was less than 5% slower than intel in gaming. SO RIP intel.
The game is a psychological mind game where you are not to think of the game.
AMD GPU will be big if it get you n hands of customers and not scalpers
bla bla bla, when you adopt avx512 ?
1:31What in the world he is editing 😂
so will i see poggers in 112x112?
I m waiting to ryzan 5 3900x...😎😯
AMD should make their own monitors that can support their CPU's at a affordable price
It's like watching nvidia competing with their own company
여왕의 목소리는 처음 들어보네요. 목소리도 그저 갓갓!
*-3%* Юхууу.... Минус 3 (-3)!!!!
I'm going to run my 3600 until it blows up but I am hoping your guys new GPUS are all there cracked up to be
I just want one thing and that is NVIDIA will cry like Intel.
Don’t eeeven with the Radeon I bought the rx 5700 a week after the market had dual fans for them, but your drivers are god awful. And im running a full amd build. To this day im still getting errors for games, and performance loss because the automatic tuning control doesn’t always like to work to where i had to manual do the tuning control. Future of Ryzen is something im looking forward to, but Unfortunately Radeon is not.
Amd ryzen 3 3200u 😁😁👍👍👍
Its just... ¿How I can explain my feelings?, with only a word, "EPYC".
14:43 are u high? i mean the cpu seems pretty good but the fps counter in the top left of that screen would beg to differ on the average fps  i know it may be the fps over the entire benchmark, but that must have been skewed. otherwise considering buying it idk
Want to find out Intel fanboys, look at the dislike button, you'll get the number !
Thank you AMD! I had dream of this days back 2010 by making my employer to  buy Buldozer chip equiped PC. It was like DR DOS days of trying to execute windows 3.0. Yes! The game is not fair, never was. It is a war of Titans and you need to chose your god in this fight. I was right by choosing you.
Glad to see, that AMD can compete with Intel since Ryzen again. As student i don't have a lot of money, but i always supported AMD buying your products, even if i don't buy the high end products. The leap from fx8350 to Ryzen 5 3600 was insane for me. I'm looking towards the rx 6000 series of GPU's and i can roughly can imagine what kind of leap that will be. I think not only you and the employees can be proud of what you achieved, also the community and customers are.
Athlon 5000g?
So.. We were really living in a age where 4 core 4 threads Cpu was top of the line, Thanks Amd, Thanks Ryzen for creating a competition where 6 core 12 threads is the bottom line of the Cpu, Really looking forward to Ryzen 5000 series.
Thx Lisa, I've just bought a new Intel i7 for my new gaming needs. But you guys there at AMD, are really doing such an amazing job.
Linux and FreeBSD  must work too
I thought it said gen z for a second
Intel be like omg
Reason why AMD Ryzen 5000 series a bit more expensive: *to prevent scalpers*
Ps5 and xbox players: now u bring the latest zen huh?
Didn't it stutter?
Dagdg.
1.2k people are upset the the Intel processor they just bought is already obsolete.
what a mouthwatering deliciously created processor AMD.... love what your doing to CPU world.  glad yah done it..
Hey AMD. I have a CART AMD Radeon HD 7400M. I am facing an issue called No Driver is installed for this device. How do I fix the problem?
AMD 😍
I got goosebumps when the GPU appeared
By 2050    Intel : finally we're making 7nm too.. Ryzen (1nm) : 7 who..??..Oh sry you're talking about my grandpa uh..!!..?!!..
Intel : we're gonna create 7nm chips too.. Remember I'm your daddy..!!.. Ryzen : sry dad..!!..You're too late..I'm up for 5nm.. Intel : oh..cmon..Gimme a break..!!..
That price tho.
Knock knock..!!... Intel : who's this? Ryzen : I'm here..!!.. Intel : but I'm not..!!..
에ㅣ
Imagine buying a 5900x for its LoL performance 🤣
블레이드앤소울 풀옵션 가능하나
This is a brief reminder intels compiler is a filthy cheat in Starcraft 2.
ah yes coming back here after apple presentation xD thanks AMD
AMD dont lean back now just because you surpassed intel, I have the wish that progress should always be done, perhaps just with less effort unless Intel really hits back now, be aware that once you had the performance crown a decade ago, Intel announced their core series so I would be paying a little more attention now. But I am sure you got this because of 5nm Zen (and still, always better iGPUs in your APUs).
리싸~쑤!
Intel to Amd is like Apple to Samsung
I'm sorry is that dude wearing hi heals??
Intel: "Oh boy I hope we don't get outclassed by any other company"  AMD: Bonjour
Intel: We for Apple not the Gamers... AMD: Love Games and is for the Gamers by real Gamers...
Лиза Су спасибо за новые видеокарты))
I get wet 🤯
AMD and Lisa Su, love you both. Continue to boldly strive forward and achieve greatness.
Is that 3.7 base?
The number of times Intel got humiliated by AMD is surreal :-)
INTEL: You're tearing me apart Lisa!!!
AMD: Changing performance     Intel: changing image
BOOOOOOOOO
AMD U NEED DO NEW APU FFS
Please don't do the OUT OF STOCK blow to me, otherwise I'll go crazy!
Why is he/she wearing heels with socks
Is anyone seriously going to upgrade from Ryzen 3000 to Ryzen 5000 though? If so, why?
I was using AMD only until 2001 when i switched over to intel. I switch again now. Also - i do not know why there are such stupid comments from Intelusers "Intel has more GHz" - does not matter if the IPC is higher and the process is smaller. But people only go by numbers, typical error made by people without a clue. Beside Compute and Workspace-Apps - AMD is going after Gaming and they show believable results - if you go higher then 1080p (or lets say 1440p) - 10900k and 3900/3950 where pretty much the same anyway. Now they improve, even if the performance would be the same overall, - more cores result in better distribution in most cases, intel can't take it. I hope they will come back, but until end 2021 i don't see a chance right now.  But this is good for us, competition drives innovation and lowers prices. So Intel-fans, thank god for AMDs innovations, so intel finally has to do something and deliver more then a couple percent uplifts. And AMD-Fans thank intel for taking the "Gaming-Crown" over and over again, to get AMD moving.
With this many instructions per clock there must by numerous security vulnerabilities awaiting to be discovered. Not that important for gaming maybe. I had been avoiding AMD CPUs in the past as they were more power hungry, but with top performance at ~100W - perhaps it's time to give them a try.
bye bye intel, Hello AMD
Play max on Xbox one controller
Please fix the problem where your processors get ripped off along with the cooler from the socket.
So guys, this is the day Intel died....
I love amd ❤️❤️❤️😁😉
remember remember, the 5th of november!!! ...*AMD drops mic
You guys have no idea how much I appreciate ryzen apus alongside millions of people. thank you AMD an Lisa you guys are awesome ❤️
So is AMD better now?
Who say girl can't do heavy work? 😏
Sweet ^_^
LET'S GO!!! I HOPE YOU WILL BEAT INTEL AND NVIDIA!! THIS IS WARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR:)
Asus got the zen 7 already 😂😂😂 Ohhh wrong channel bye. . .
RIP intel 14++++++nm  AMD 7nm
AMD really kicked Intel very hard 😂😂😂
I have a AMD 480x and it’s literally slowly dying, it keeps overheating and turning off and i can’t run games like I could a while ago I’m starting to get tired of AMD tbh
리싸~쑤!
I think intels gonna skip thr naming of 11000 series of desktop cpus.  They're gonna  go straight to 12000 series. The 11000 doesnt fit well with 11900k, but 12900k sits well with the tongue.
R.I.P Intel, peace ✌
AMD needs to pay attention to P / P.  Now, they are small.
Amd>intel
Why aren't you upgrading the Threadripper AMD 3960/70/90x cpus?
I guess if there were subtitles, they would just say RIP Intel
AMD, sticking it to intel in performance and price !!
22:30 Well Big knobby can go back in his boxers and Nvidia 30 series For The Win!! AMD's next graphics cards going to be called BIG FANNY LIPS lol 😂😂😂
Hi, I recently just did my very first unboxing video, feel free to check it out !
After a few years AMD will be mad to give a name to 100THz proccesor because they will be out of names xD
Ryzen 5600X (6 core, PROCESSOR ONLY) = $299 Xbox Series S (8 core processor, 10 gb RAM, 512 SSD, graphics card, controller) = $299   GO HOME AMD, you are DRUNK!!!
Look at this woman clearly, she is the Chosen One, she will destroy intel , reduce it to atoms
Everyone and their dog is going to be trying to buy the 5900x just to get that "Extra" performance
Anybody willingly purchasing overpriced and super-hyped Intel products in late 2020 and beyond -- has gotta to have his/her head closely examined.
13:41  I wanted to dive through my screen to grab it
Lisa Su!!
Intel is still good for gaming AMD Fans: LAMO DUMBO Me: just Shut Up, Let me do my Gaming and IDC about FPS AMD Fans: Ok Then but Intel is still not good LOL Me: GET OUT OF MY ROOM! IDC
Where is ryzen 4000 tho?
Lisa sun i lowe you
Intel Fanboys new excuse about liking Intel:  INTEL IS NOT ONLY GOOD BUT IS BLUE!!! WE ALL LOVE BLUE!!
Here i am still using my r3 1200
intel pierde amd:GG
It’s too popular it came up as an ad...
*cry’s in zen 1*
All i heard was a Intel getting there ass handed to them in a rap battle.
BUY STOCK NOW!!!
Intel: *18. July 1968          ✞08.10.2020
You have to up your DAW performance game in comparison to INTEL (protools, cubase, ableton live, etc.).
hey
@AMD can you please build me a cheap pc
would eat Lisa's snatch for new GPU..
Waiting for Intel to really crush them again! AMD is proving over and over again in a span of many decades that, if they deliver something good, their prices are going to be even more salty than Intel's, oh and don't forget, their production capacity(reserved at TSMC) can never be as big as Intel's, so their supply issues is not what the global markets need. Intel and Nvidia will respond in a harsh way sooner or later, sorry but AMD is always going to be that cheap alternative, and their stock may fall again as it did in the Bulldozer times(oh never forget how they lied to all of us about their false core counts back then, terrible companies never change)
The prices are Disappointedز
AMD wins
7nm+ 640sp GPU?
Thank you guys!!!!
Nice Amd! price of zen 2  r7 330$ now price r7 449$. they price going like intel.! i never buy again this cpu 21% faster than zen2 and price 21% than zen2.
i will build my Zen3 cpu in 2021 confirmed!
bet ryzen 5 5600 non X will be 199 and micro center will put it on sale for like $179.  ;D
FCK YEEESSS . . . FINALLY
Intel punching the air right now.
As team blue I like to see this, I want to see some heavy competition because that increases the advancement of technological development. These CPUs are undoubtedly insane. I’m just wondering how does more cores and the unified cache come into play? I get the 5950X is a Gaming AND Creator CPU, but with the 5900X why do you need 12 cores?
I think amd forgot about budget game's 😶😶
I love for amd and intel
Sony amd microsoft be like : Divided By gamers United by AMD
lisa su yes
Microsoft fan boys where are you come at me.
yes
This presentation is very Apple-esqe. Well done AMD!
BIG THANKS for making CPU's that are affordable and amazing AMD! Hooray for gamers, hooray for creators, hooray for AMD!
so amd price high than intel now
When mom teach me about a brand new  micro-processor.....GREAT
I have a question: Does Ryzen 5900X have two separating cache L3?  Or together one cache L3? You told each L3 cache have 8 Cores. But 5900x have 12 Cores that means 8 Cores per L3 and 4 Cores per L3 , they are not together?
Are these compatible with the b450 motherboards?
I was with team red, am with team red and will be with team red  BTW *Red is not an imposter*
Why this man wearing heels
Hey!! AMD,, Wait!!! 5000?
If this is as good as they say, Intel won’t have a single leg to stand on.
I fear no man.... but that woman....... it scares me...........  -Intel CEO
So basicaly the 5950x is the best now
-3% on Battlefield V?! This is absolute trash.
"If you're lucky!" That's god's giving in work
AMD WON!INTEL HAS DIED!IT IS TRUE!THEY HAVE WON!
Le me in india : okay its $300(₹23000)  but lets see indian priced on ₹30000. Import taxs are so fked up
What's up with this 5xxx series ?  Why not 4900x 4950x , but 5900x ?
Intel has left the chat
intel PANIK
Lisa Su and her husband Dan are based in Austin, Texas. Su and Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang have been described as cousins or niece and uncle however, she has dismissed these claims as "not true" (i got it from Wikipedia), two monster on IT peripherals Industry
watching this on my 3300x and rx570, red team!
she did a good job at getting amd out of the dump
Intel or amd?? Like if intel Dislike if amd
Where gaming AND price increases begin. Fueled by a Monopoly
Guys, Intel's already dead. No need to keep kicking them
Please fix your OpenGL drivers first.
1.1K intel fanboys dislike this
i came
Maybe in 2030, I'll be able to buy it 😭.
5950X... THATS ALL.... GEEZ AMD... I'm loving this so far... KEEP THE FOOT On THE GAS
She is like my grandmother....  love AMS
i should've chose this bad boi
The vast majority of the $50 price hike for every SKU of Ryzen-5K, will not go into R&D. I guarantee it will go into the pockets of fat cat investors (whom AMD want to keep happy) and also the yearly 'bonuses' for Lisa Su, Mark Papermache, etc. As if these fat cats don't have enough money. BTW, Lisa Su has amassed a personal wealth of $146 million ever since she became CEO of AMD.
AMD is best best best best
Once A girl said i work in intel.. I left the chat in a milisecond
Intel : We got 10th gen    AMD : Hold my beer & Watch this
AMD inside Kidney outside.
AMD inside Kidney outside.
It’s amazing what this woman and her staff achieved. To ryze like that when you lie beaten on the ground and bring a giant to his knees, this usually simply doesn’t happen. Now we need this for Windows.
So  AMD 5900x + rtx 3090
Alternative title: Where Intel ends | AMD Ryzen™ Desktop Processors
So AMD breaks a record.. then breaks its own record lmao
intel left the chat
great work amd  i love gaming  using amd processor bye bye intel
i wonder how fast computers will be in the next 100 years
if AMD wants to go higher and higher, why don't they sell the product in less amount.
until now AMD FX CPU is still the world record holder for 8.2ghz clock speed..
Damn....🔥🔥❤️❤️ I always loved AMD and supported ...🙏
I want!!!!!!!!!! I do have a question. Why does it not do as well in battlefield?
If there would be ddr 5 support I would buy one, till no ddr5 no buying
expensive dont do in like intel
Ps5 zen not even get out and they talk zen 3 angry bad marketing
I love u AMD❤️❤️❤️
Please amd ryzen 5 3600 ससता करदो 🤣😅
Yet again Intel wrecked again
5NM i mean damn  let us appreciate 7nm first for god sakes
I’m here for Lisa
Her voice sounds like that from a game character. She Sounds cool.
I can't wait to for this new generation of Zen 3 processors and Radeon 6000 series of graphics processors. Awesome
Keep rubbing it in intels face, AMD i like your style
Intel is officially dead  RIP Intel 1968-2020
Ryzen is no.1 no kap
“We wanted to disrupt the PC market”  Sorry, but i still only want a Nvidia 3080 RTX for christmas.
K
14nm+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ or 7nm? whelp - goodbye 8700K, hello X570 and Ryzen 5900X (3900X in the meantime); just a better all-around system (and not just for gaming). I think the only Intel based systems I have left are gaming laptops whom refuse to use AMD for the high-ends and this MBP16 im typing this on...  Now if RDNA2 beats RTX 3000, more salt in the wound to Nvidia lol
Hire me AMD
I’ma wait till it’s actually reviewed as Nvidia claimed the 3070 is better than the 2080 ti buts tbh it’s about equal so let’s wait to judge it and before I’m called a Intel Stan, I use the ryzen 7
Cool, but is it going to hit rated boost clocks on my x470?
17:10
esta muito caro!
Suc it intel
Who would have thought AMD would deliver a CPU thats really good for gaming. Sure, heavy workload AMD was really good, but for gaming Intel was king. Curious what Intel will do now.  Also curious to see what Big Navi will do, because Nvidia was king in gaming as well.  Love that there finally is competition.
Now what we need are AMD Ryzen 5800H gaming laptops with RTX 3070
Intel is better
Very much impressed! But what about cheaper variants following R3 3200g , Atlon 3000g?
The guys who bought stocks for $ 2 a AMD share back then must be very, very rich now
I love team red BUT team blue on 10nm. Is only at most 45% less rn. what happens when they 7nm there units. 631 is about 15% than 10900k, ice lake is up to 20% so around about the same give or take 3-5% now add 7nm with your dreams. first time in my lifetime team red = team blue both around 631. price wise > gaming wise > workload wise what im most impressed by is how little power used
Ryzen is such an epic name. I love it.
Red AMD PCiE-4.0 > blue intel pcie-3.0  Send me four or eight exemplares of all your products for free, thank you in advance.  I would love to use the Ryzen5950x, RadeonRx6900 with the AoRus x570 Xtreme.  If had those, I could have done already one two videos of my World-Rescue-Offers. There would be less Fires, Floods and Deadly Accidents all around the world already, because I know important things since over 15 years.
it would be funny if they said it was as good as the Ryzen AMD 3
So much leadership
Coffin Lake: Intel Inside®
i can't wait for the new mobile version of AMD Ryzen 5000 series, and would be a dream if they use a Navi (mobile GPU) , i'm sorry , but i'm always on the go and for 10 years i use laptops. Even now im still loyal with AMD..at the moment my working Laptop is an HP Pavilion with an AMD A8 7410, and next year i want to change it with a new processor and video card..hopefully DDR5
i hate my laptop that have intel, there wasnt an option with amd when i bought it now i feel like i should have waited
Between the battle of giants, customers are winners
But can it run crisis remastered.
Intel nibaas
So this is where the real game begins.
Dr. Lisa Su looks so confident as if she’s just going to knock some Intel people in combat right now, amazing work what she has done all these years to get AMD right where it belongs
What motherboards will be compatible with these new cpus can someone help me?
PC enthusiasts in UK are not happy with AMD's rip-off prices for 5K Ryzen. AMD has completely ignored to take into account the current economic austerity as a result of UK being financially blackmailed by EU thugs (due to Brexit) and also as a result of the economic downturn induced by covid19. Almost 3 million Brits have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.   Discussion forums are saying to boycott 5K Ryzen until AMD lower the rrp for each tier. Even Paul at 'NAAF' is saying that AMD are taking the p*ss with 5K Ryzen pricing.   AMD also does not like constructive criticism because they keep deleting my comments which voice my concerns. How is this behaviour any different from a dictator state?.    So I am going to make a stand, as I have just unsubscribed from the AMD youtube channel and I intend to upload a vlog on my youtube channel regarding the 5K-Ryzen price hike scandal.
So proud to be a shareholder. Lisa Su is incredible!
I have a bad feeling AMD are going to jump on the milking band wagon with big navi as they have done with 5K Ryzen. Here are RRP on OCUK -  5800X = £429. 5900X = £530. 5950X = £750.   Now compare it to the launch prices of the Ryzen 3K series -  3700X = £329. 3800X = £388. 3900X = £480.  3950X = £700.   We are seeing noticeable price jumps from £41 to £50. Many discussion forums in UK are saying to boycott 5K Ryzen until AMD lower the rrp.   I watched the AMD unveil of 5K Ryzen and after the show ended I aired my concerns about the very high price hike. I was verbally assaulted by brain-washed AMD fanboys. I am clearly not the only pc enthusiast in UK who is very unhappy with AMD's pricing. Even Paul at 'NAAF' is not happy.
Just some glued chips huh...looks a little more complicated than that.
Well... F U intel, im throwing my good old intel fanboy shirt to garbage bin.
Waaaaao.
You mean NOT lying about a product yields a better customer base? No fuckin way. I would have never guessed.
This prices is a joke...
respect for CEO Lisa Su
This is a mile stone but we want more cheap processor specially Ryzen 5 5600X in the Bangladesh ......thanks to AMD.
Amd should bring a budget processor like 2 cores for low class family in Pakistan 🇵🇰 we want a processor like that and we needed it 👍🏽
Can’t wait😋
If it's actually true AMD, release CPUs for immediate and unfettered/unrestricted review today.  Stand by your statements without delay unbiased evaluation.
AMD's version of teabagging Intel.
Who’s going to pay for Intel’s funeral?
People before 2020: What is gaming?
Proud to say that I'm going to build my first gaming PC with an AMD processor.
I seem to have walked into an AMD fanboy circle jerk.
LMFAO  RIP AMD with their 50%+ price increase. WELCOME BACK INTEL
1k dislikes were set by inteboys
1K dislikes from Intel
But the question is: Will they run on my X470?
AMD: for gamers by gamers Intel: for money by shareholders.
Stop being a fanboy for team red or team blue. AMD and Intel just want to be better than each other. They don't care about Value for gamers. After all they are companies, the want to make money, as long as they trick us into buying their products they aren't going to care about our feelings.
Drop xt varients and lower the price for me
Imagine if amd don't release ryzen CPUs...
AMD to intel --another one bites the dust
Head of Intel: "Some software runs faster on an Intel because some greedy people were offered cash to write their software with the Intel compiler, the one that secretly detects who's processor it is first before deciding if top speed is needed. The benefit is that people can put food on the table.  I thought it was illegal to avoid tax and bride people to only use your products. So, pay tax, be honest about how much tax we've actually paid, don't bribe anyone and stop slapping a new number on the same processors every time a tiny competitor launches a new processor. Got it. Thanks for the advice. Why oh why didn't anyone tell me this years ago?  There has been a tiny whisper that someone was waving big college-student checks near the Dell, Hewlett Packard, Acer dinner tables if they correctly predicted which processors were being delivered by the wrong trucks to their factories.  Incidentally, the people around Germany got to see college students Media Markt, Europe's biggest computer seller, take part in the television game show "Guess the Truck".  A strong aroma drifted over the fence from a neighbour's barbeque that if Intel eliminated their competition then only the LATEST Intel SSD would work with the newest processors but it was only the smell of sausages, I can tell you.  This is a private message for our fanboys ONLY: maybe, just maybe, there's a teeny tiny bit of truth to the idea that someone else might make faster processors?  Ouch! Get off my leg. You're not my pet. How do you get rid of this thing?  I also have a famous mega family but right now I think I need to visit some of my rich uncles, uncle Googie and uncle Amazy, to pass on some of these new tips so that they don't get into trouble with the law.  And by the way uncle Amazy is the one who sells all our processors out of his garage, along with several fridge magnets. At least, that's what he told me.  He says that the garage is where he keeps his 1535 cars but as none of them have worked for the last 14 years he's been getting rides from auntie Ubee's cars. I really think it's time she starts paying tax too.  Oh and you can keep your money too. We don't need any more of it, thank you very much."
Those 1k down votes are from Intel fanboys. How can no one be amazed by this?
Man please upgrade your A.P.U because we loved it very much.... please do it......
Intel: "AY BELIEVE AY CAN FLAAAAYYAWWWSHHHIT!!!!!"  💥💥💥☠ ☠ ☠
please make a processor with 2tb of ram
Now Intel has a new YouTube add campaign where they whine about their 3d transistors from 2012. Like bro you got nothing just be quiet
That's nice and all.  Intel is dying due to lack of ingenuity and overinflated prices due to overinflated ego.  But...  WHERE IS THE R3 3300X?  It was only released 6 months ago and next to nobody can get one!  My new build has only been on the back burner for 4 months now waiting on this chip!  I'm still running my 3-year old R5 1400 because I'm stuck waiting!
Intel is best ever
The silence during the moments when normally people would scream is so eery it makes the announcements so much more monumental.
Ssd
Plz give us low budget gpu in bangladesh market for gamers.waiting for reply
Their goal is giving us the best😎
Finally i can play Detroit become human
6:50 light color changes based on clothes color
1k dislike 100% Intel fan boys.
Intel is dead to us gamers
Ryzen>>>>intel
Intel 10th gen is a joke
AMD:in, Intel:out
That's nice and all but how will you handle the scalpers and the availability issues?
So the 5900X will be in 8+4 or 6+6 config?
Fam intel is done
AmD : intel ka daddy
AMD ARYZEN!!!!!
Why is that men's voice so girly?
i really don't know why would someone need high fps on a game as LoL.
Hell yeah let'z go
haha
Intel RIP
Dam she is so hot that she burned all intel fanboys
Rip intel
will you ever fix gpu drivers?
I really appreciate your hardwork but pls make CPUs a little cheap because your cpu price is my full pcs price🤣🤣 I am talking about ryzen 9 5000 series  Intel:- dead inside🤣🤣😆😆😂😂
those 1k dislikes are from Intel users.
All i know is TSMC i gonna be very rich
2018 cpus-amd 2019 cpus-amd 2020 cpus-amd gpu-amd console- aMd!!!! the world_ A M D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
intel chuckles im in danger
AMDYES
With these prices, there's only 1 CPU you'll sell: 5900X
Holy smokes what a presentation! There should be a pandemic a week before all major presentations. They produce such better quality than live events.
Why is it so much more expensive?? Turning into Intel already... That didnt take long
You know what these prices are? They are the compensation of the profit they don't make on consoles. Cpu customers have to pay extra money because AMD is giving so much silicon to Sony and Microsoft and it's altmost impossible to make any nice profit there (at the price of ~ $500 for the whole console).
Intel to giyo 😂😂
Big D CPUs :)
Intel is way better, I hv used both
1500FPS on Farmville
This aunty is cool.
STONKS
Want amd in MacBooks and imacs
1. But the i9-10900 and the i9-10900K [the direct compressions which have been made here] are selling, now, for $469 [vs AMD's $549] and $549 [vs AMD's $799]... So, yeah, AMD's processors are stronger than Intel's, at the moment, but also cost more. Hasn't AMD's selling point used to be the value [cost/performance]? Or am I missing something? 2. These kind of events just doesn't make sense for these kind of products... I mean, there's nothing really to show but, "Behold the chip!". That's just silly.
Intel is now too far behind AMD. A similar case happened 20 years ago. History is a cycle.
Yes!
In this drag race Intel is now miles behind
intel fans hitting dislike
This lady ( Dr. Lisa Su ) brought AMD from brink of bankruptcy to the top of its game 😄
Waiting for Oct 28th🤩🤩🤩🤩
I think Intel needs at least 5 years to make an even playground again.  This is like how PC components worked... remember that Intel need AiB to produce easy to access components? Now AMD use 3rd party foundry to make their processor and focus on the design.  Seeing how Intel is working alone is a bit pity... they can't just win alone, everything must work in harmony.... hey... i think that's what Zen means "Harmony". And seeing how AMD use the same strategy like Nvidia against Radeon is ... impressive.  It means that AMD sure is learning from its disadvantage and adapting. For others that don't know what I mean, Nvidia is basicly doing the opposite that Intel. While Intel is "slacking" because there was no significant competitor, they made themselves beaten by AMD.  Nvidia is balancing the products with its competitor, making them a step or 2 steps ahead. At this point, we should be agree that Nvidia is overall the best GPU for any price given. Damn their RTX Voice is great for video conferencing...  Back to CPU, let's just say that AMD is winning the performance in the trifecta: Desktop, Mobile, and Enterprise And with Zen3, I can see that they will be winning Enterprise since the topology is simillar to Intel: without chiplet
I was literally just gonna buy a second gen AMD ryezn 5 processor from them and they come out with a better version. Good stuff😂
Cmon I still have a Intel Integrated Graphics.. plez give money :(
Poor man's Grandma Lisu Su
Still no goddamn RTX hahaha we lose again
Video intro really gives me goosebumps 😭😭😭😭 👍👍👍👍👍 for AMD
RISE ZEN!
why woman? the voice  :(
Zen advancement, mature like fine wine :)
I wish Amd Could Focus on their Gpu NOT CPU
3:51 * loves money 💰
I can just buy a pc with this much money
AMD should come up with Policy of give the old CPU and take the new one
Didn't know Jeff Bezo's brother works at AMD.
You should send your very first sample to Linus as he got the most views of your cpu and gpu impression...
Watching AMD rise is like seeing an UNDERDOG win. 👌🏻👌🏻
I just realized 5900's single threaded score is higher than my i7 4710hq's muilted threaded score lol
She's Nvidia CEO in disguise
Costs too much
Hope intel makes a comeback and make amd lower their prices.
My God how far you guys have come! 1º in gaming now who'd have thought
when first ryzen came out i said AMD has risen...well i said it right
Are you lost babygirl ?
she aslmost as boss, as putin
The reason why i went to amd I can upgrade without a new motherbord
i wanna see big navi vs the rtx 3000 series
GO TEAM RED!!!!! Im so happy i bought my first laptop as an AMD machine. Ryzen 3 3200u Vega 3 4 gigs ddr4 ram 128 gigs m.2 ssd upgraded to 16 gigs dual channel (2x 8 gig sticks) and an external 4 tb hdd
Pls, open your authorized distributor in Indonesia. Here in Indonesia, AMD's processors usually priced 20-50% more than worldwide's SRP. The higher tier, the higher price difference from the rest of the world :(  Sorry english not good
I've heard enough "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
Intel: our goal is to take you're money
Amd: i am the best Amd 20:25 : well guess what i just beat myself now i am double best Intel: cries in a corner
I hope AMD can stay competitive forever. I was there for SKT A & 939, the best times. My next upgrade will be zen 3 over my 2017 i7.
Hey do we have to use thermal paste for ryzen 5 1600?(
love you AMD
Those 1k dislikes are from the CEO of Intel using fake google accounts XD . How honest launch of a processor! they didn't even hide the -3% in battlefield! LMAO I am selling my old Intel processors to get an AMD
Just take my wallet.
I love AMD❤️❤️❤️
Ryzen 9 5950X !!!!! Beauty and the beast 😍😍😍🤤🤤🔥🔥
I love you Dr.
It's like the tide, always falling and Ryzen! I will care you here in my heart, you'll remind me That come what may, I know the way I am, AMD!
i7 10700 16gb ddr4 3600(2933) b460 motherboard rtx 2070 1tb nvme cost 1K cheaper to build with intel.
But,  Who plays at 1080P   >>>>> ????     80% are moving to 4K
Me when he said that there are people who want to create and game: Ya sold me
That one dislike is Intel
ryzen 5600x is $299 6c12t VS i7 10700 8c16t $299
AMD!YES!
Does Big Navy have Ray Tracing???
Intel either innovates (cut prices, less power draw) or Die it’s that simple
I'm watching this on Intel i3 6100 processor LOL!!!!
I guess you could say this is an Epyc win for AMD.
Big win AMD we thank you!!
Intel Roasted 😈😁
Intel : showed with their 11th gen AMD : May I Kill You Sir?
For someone who doesnt know...Can someone tell me which is "better"...The new ryzen 5 5600x...or...the ryzen 7 3700x...I'm building a pc for my gf this christmas season, just wanna know which cpu i should go for
Me crying in a ryzen 5 3400g 4 cores😭
well dude maybe next year will be a coming up new brand processor with clock speed up to 12 Ghz :D
So will it work on a 3rd gen board like b450
CEO Dr. Lisa love you every gamer
I only disliked because it was at 999
I wanted to buy R5 3600 due to covid It's overpriced in my country,,  i will have it ryzen.. I will... I just can't wait to use a ryzen product..
Esos de AMD siempre se tienen algo contra mi dinero siempre me lo quieren despeluchar.
Intel fanboys be disliking hard. Grow up. Ryzen's been winning the game.
R.I.P Intel.
6:57 - That cut, lol. From gestures, to no gestures, just like that!
eh, i like intel more
At least AMD unlike intel has the balls to put that its 3% worse vs intel in BF5 because we all intel is never going to do that
Now pair those with a rtx 3080🙈🙉
Dr Su wearing Intel shoes? Because those are hot!
AMD is like the sleeping dragon  guess it woke up and is pissed
Wish I bought your stock when it was only $54 a share
If this is true, I am happy for AMD...competition is good.   However, as someone who does lots of benchmark videos...there are quite a few issues I can see with AMD's comparions:  1) Did a neutral person play on both systems 2) How many games did they play before figuring out averages. 3) AMD states exactly what DX they used to beat Intel.  Was Intel constrained to the same DX? 4) Are we to assume that Intel kicked AMD's butt in 2 of the most popular games FortNite and Warzone?   10th gen I5/I7/I9 crush 3900x in FortNite.   (they show Warzone with Big Navi) 5)  Does anyone play half these games anymore? 6) When Intel released I9-11900k, these numbers will get at least 3% closer at 17:21   I will believe it when I have my hands on one of these....personally disappointed with 3900x vs any of my Intel I7's or I9's in the games I play for my channel.  3900XT wasn't really worth adding to the lineup.   So maybe I am wrong...but I think for now I will keep using Intel.
End of Intel 😍😍🥰💪
team red lets go
I wonder if that means the Ryzen 3600 will come down to the original price. This year and next with 3600, then buy the Zen 4 at the end of 2021
I love you Lisa !
Intel is gonna DEMOLISH amd soon, just wait
The taiwanese are taking over the PC world!!!
Swapping to amd after this
imagine buying an intel core i9-10900k the day before they announce this
Chinese, Zen, Red - The sign of CCP all over AMD
Ok, lets just dont roast the poor intel,  Wait, i just did
All the dislikes are intel fanboys
So your next gen chip beats intels current Gen chip? no way!!! What are you going to do when Intel drops its next chip? besides be number 2
This is the Nvidia guy disguised as a woman.
Bro the beginning is like a movie trailer
Damn intel gotta fight back
🕳👌🎤👁👄👁
You need different naming conventions for your CPU and GPU product lines.
*Stop. Intel is already dead STOOOP*
I want amd than intel but i use nvidia graphics card lol
I like AMD's direction but i'm good with my i9 9900k, i'll upgrade in 3 years
We can't underestimate intel because they didn't make such overkill chipsets because they were first all these times intels r&d can simply develop a new processor
Wonder when they will start selling thread ripper sized packages with 16 cores and 64 gigs HBM3 for system memory built on infinity fabric? Then we can have non-volatile DDR5 256gig DIMMs for the OS drive? PCIE 4.0 NVME can be the slow long term storage...
Our mommy has arrived,..
So she is doing it and she is not a poce of sheaaet like Steve Jobs.
Lisa is a badass
When your asian auntie went on to save an entire tech company
Intel is lacking the perfect leadership.The more you see Ryzen CEO. The more you will be amazed by her leadership quality.
Press F to pay respect for intel
Now just waiting for budget friendly AMD GPU😍
Prize fools
If they just focus on the processors and just drop making graphics cards , i think it would be better for AMD themselves . Nice improvements ahead . Its seems like games are going backwards and looking way too much like the old cartoons not life like its getting really poor games wise.
mmm cheaper items in ps5 and xbox mmm yea why not talk about satopping change MB and stay in one system and then get the best out of future cpu power and cores nope its all about buying bying bying selling selling cheap crap...!!!! my old system 11years old sli580 intel 920 stil going strong here hahahahaha..
one proccessor to rule them all
Don't stop the good work AMD, keep pushing, push your own boundaries, even if you are on the top, just keep going, good work.
Great Stuff! I hope Big Navi is all we are hoping for. I am quite looking forward to Justifying an all AMD PC!! Just like back in the 2000s. Nostalgia and performance in one make me a happy customer.
Wished for lower price cpu options aswell.
I hope that zen 3 Ryzen mobile is released with RDNA 2 integrated graphics. It will be the real disruption when there's no more intel integrated graphics
she called it BIG NAVI
RIP Intel
when the leaps are so good, they skipped a generation

I know intel gonna suprise us :)
просто купи райзен, 5600 райзен
Should have used the Crysis remaster instead of Borderlands 3, then she could have gone; "Yes, it can run Crysis!"
amd: reveals the 5000 series  intel: can someone explain why is there a boss bar i
Very interesting that in the presentation of AMD about the new processors (ZEN3), right at the end they showed the test platform, when comparing Intel 10900K v Ryzen 9 5900x and Ryzen 9 3900x v Ryzen 9 5900x, and as a graphics card they used an RTX 2080 Ti and not one of their upcoming new boards or their current top of the range 5700XT.
I still love intel but AMD you are KILLING IT
So you have to pay over $100 more than a leading Intel processor, for +6% improvement? Fanboys cmon now you aren't this dumb.
Lisa Su make a great job, is so good see AMD in their best moment, congratulations to all the staff who make possible this quality improve year after year.
on my birthday  amd ryzen 9 5950x processor is avaiable What do you think I'll get for free xd
With that disaster of a 3080 launch This will be my first every AMD gpu and man im excited !
I love you AMD❤️ Forever💞😘 can't afford all this right now but as soon as I get my job, my dream PC will be all AMD🙌❤️
I remember seeing the reveille of the Ryzen CPUs at Siggraph in 2017. I was sold then.
Can't wait to get a new ryzen 5000 chip. Hopefully AMDs new graphics cards are really good too.
The name Ryzen sounds like Rising which in itself has a positive force towards it.
AMD while developing 1st gen Ryzen... 📉____________________📈     📉_______________📈         📉__________📈             📉_____📈                      •           Ryzen release
2005: Intel Inside ...  2020: Intel Outside
This is what I want to see. Competition not greedy stagnation.   Keep going AMD!
Their CPUs are on a roll, I'm just hoping that GPUs will catch up.
Looks like AMD gonna pull an Intel with their "7nm+" bull####. I mean don't get me wrong I'll like AMD and Intel equally but I prefer a healthy market with equal opposition becuase then they habe more motive to push their limits.
Too expensive  very disappointing  I will not buy with this price
GG
Ok yes 5900X may be way faster and better than 3600/3600X, but it’s also $100/$50 more.  (really $120/$90 with current prices)  I’m waiting for them to announce lower end options
All dislikes are from intel users
Сделайте видеодрайвер для RX5700xt, купил видеокарту топового сегмента с надеждой о хорошей работе в графических редакторах !!!А нам blenderщикам огромную крысу подложили!! Больше никогда не куплю AMD!!!
good to see amd destroying intel
I just want Intel to win smh
Team amd💪
can the 6000 do ray tracing
RIP Intel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Him breathing in after every word is getting a bit irritating
Great news, AMD! And no ads 😂 ))))))))))))))))))
I almost went with Intel with my first PC build. I’m glad I didn’t. I’ve never bought an Intel system, and I’ll keep never doing that. 😎
humanity started off with sticks and stones and now we are at CPUs and GPUs
I hope they make a apu under 200$
Who's here after watching this video decides to switch from Intel to AMD?
AMD Have definitely beaten Intel . Congratulations. Let see what it does against Nvidia.
I wish I could go AMD, but I use my pc for work too.. Unfortunately the apps are optimized for Intel. Maybe next year I might build a second pc just for gaming
Bye bye intel, anyways, I have r5 3600 I am more than satisfied 😆
👏👏👏👏👏👏
AMD killed it☺️😊😍😍
Switched to Ryzen Threadripper (3390X) from Xeon CPU and holy macaroni i'm never going back
lol. Those high heels.
I have ryzen 2700 and still doing all good în 1080p with rx 590 ...and i have this combo for 2 year ..:))
If not cuz 50$ price increase on all chip,, Ryzen 5000 will have interesting value  I mean, 5800X seem expensive if you look 5900X offers and both don't come with cooler!  plus 5600X only come with Wraith Stealth which was Ryzen 3 series cooler  WTF !?    I'm telling you, the milking is happening for real now
Love Intel always 💙💙💙
I have wonderful Ryzen 3 1300X and broken pins Ryzen 3 1200. And now I'm looking for next upgrade.
love u AMD
Skip to 23:06 for amd 6000 series gpu showing ! thank me later.
I report this video for murder....finally Intel is dead
BIG NAVI
Intel team. Where are u ??? 😅
I like the end of the video even if its just hype: " btw nvidia we can point the shotgun in your direction too", lol
苏妈威武，5950X流弊，直接铲除蓝厂最强桌面U。期待红厂的HEDT，传说中的128C/256T,可能64C/128T就直接虐菜了
I'm not particularly happy that there are no equivalent tiers to the 3700X,or the 3600. The price increase for Zen 3 is fine for the performance uplift, but without those product tiers, the price increase for an entry level 6-core or an entry level 8-core is too high. I had planned on an upgrade to a Ryzen 5000 series, but I am now reconsidering this.
What is an example of a workload that is not latency sensitive?
Intel destroyed
boost clocks on 1 core are basically advertising scam only and they keep quiet about all core clocks but seems that they will be like zen2  XT versions so around 4,5ghz
CSGO net game are biggest garbage  what exist on planet ever !! such a laagy buggy crashy stutering game i didnt see in the time when dial up exist   so i think that 19% more fps will not change anything untill those assholes from Valve dont buy better servers and make updates for fix own shits  not updates for censorhip there because peoples curse them or each other because they think it is cheaters alotz there  while they have deal with  terrible garbage of  company because it is no matter if you got there 1000 or 50 fps when you get terribly unstable and stutering game with tons of laag especially on dustmap and assholes from Valve  talks&lies that 256mb card and dual core from 2008 are enough !!
still wait cheaper intel future gen
Intel just got yeeted by amd hard.
AMD: **Launches Zen3* Intel: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
AMD YES!
made by TSMC, Gooooooood job
Respect++++  For even including the -3% in the list
A minute of silence for those who lost patience while waiting for zen 3.
The best thing happened in 2020 !
nobody: everybody in chat: too expensive mimimimi
Intel better
Watching on 2nd laptop at 2:05 :) First time moving to AMD, and very much satisfied, compared to old i3-5th gen on very old laptop this experience is like 80x better. I now started to hate intel now a days... And becoming pure ryzen fan, I wish there could be an official Ryzen TDP changer, clock speed limiter or sth like that for mobile processors in the future :)
I want a computer, but the financial situation does not allow, please help 😢😳😔
The most important thing is the prices, we don't want praise as Intel has fallen because of their high prices and their poor cores only
Yeahh !!! Amd Ryzen so strong right now ... So im will pick up brand new i9 10900k with saleoff price xDxDxD
Great.
When you are poor, you have to be happy with your intel i5 3rd gen.
But the question I want to know is how well does it do in 4K gaming with RTX 3800 ?
lol maniacal
Ryzen vs Ryzen
This procesor brand is my favorite     Edit: pls athlon 5000g
AMD: For the gamers, by the gamers  Intel: Intel Inside, Kidney Outside
Loving My AMD Ryzen 7 3700x.
I was an amd fan but come on, 300 dollar for a 5600x?...
AMD has ryzen again, while Intel is falling now  ;)
AMD: WE ARE THE BeST NvIDIA: LOL, in losing AMD: .......................
alright, I've been overdue for an upgrade from my Haswell platform. Team Red sealed the deal with this one, I'm buying a R7 5800X.  hope Radeon can catch up to GeForce, but I'm not confident that'll be happening this time around.
Rendered the new consoles obselete before they even launch. Couldn't wait even an extra week before releasing them?
What's up with the price hike?
It's too expensive 😫
👍
amd win, wait oh never mind right video
so excited! we can't wait for the next BSOD with this new GPU 😂🤣
Ha I’m getting a r9 3900x
Already paid 600e for 3900x last year so I'm fine at the moment.Maybe Zen 6 when I see double performance in 3 years time.
Press F To pay respect for Intel
I build my first PC using a Ryzen 5 2600. No complaints. Awesome! Still using now.
There will probably be a ryzen 5 5600 and ryzen 3 versions like the previous gens right? Cuz im too broke to afford the 5600x
and I am still using FX8320 lol I'm dirt poor AF
Good thing I bought a Ryzen 3 3200g. Integrated graphics alone crushed Intel HD Graphics lol
Noob questions. Do these CPUs improve performance at 1440p and 4k too? Or just 1080? Why do they only mention 1080?
Dr lisa su  for president 2020  !!    im very happy with my ryzen 2700x  in my use i dont need to upgrade   but i may anyway just to support amd
AMD is my love❤️❤️❤️. Great job AMD
The title should be edited to "The rise of Budget Gamers"
Any of these processors will arrive costing a car here in Brazil.
😶😁😁
AMD Inside  Kidney Outside
Intel isn't that bad but Ryzen are better
I am ready to bought this prosessor
1) Unstable 2) Expensive 3) Without graphics 4) Without cooler 5) 10700k much better choice  6) Thank you
Battlefield V: *-3%* Intel fanboys: "SEE?! I TOLD YOU THAT INTEL IS CLEARLY BETTER! INTEL WON AGAIN!! GO TEAM BLUE"
AMD yes
POWER TO YOU, AMD!!!
I swear intel is just dead
das revolution has begun
Wow
AMD Threadripper make my electricity bill more expensive  But still ok to pay for great performance
Intel took everyone for granted, AMD has the right focus, they know many of us love them for affordable gaming cpu.
I bought my 3700X for £300, but on CCL online shop, the 5800X is listed for £466.57. There is no f*cking way I am paying that much for an 8c/16t SKU. In fact, I will NOT pay more than £300 for AMD's 8c/16t SKU. I have been saying since 5th February 2020 that AMD are going to jump on the milking band wagon for Ryzen-3 and big Navi. AMD is proving me right. Bottom line is that AMD is becoming greedy like intel and nvidia.
the pricing is really disappointing they are trying to sell more 12 cores by making the 8 core expensive. like the popcorn pricing where medium $6.50 and large $7
nVidia better watch out. Intel on Sucide Watch!
Random person who like this will become millionaire someday
Papermaster  that so mgs character name
Oops Intel 😂
Still intel is better.
intel should be worried
Man I wish they were both 6000 series though, I want R9 6900X to go with my RX 6900 XT lol
well im a zen2 owner😅😅 ryzen 5
24:22 may I know what is the name of the music?
Intel has no chance to beat the AMD right now cuz flagship cpu from intel runs at 5.3GHz but amd runs 400Mhz slower and compares with intel. This is done by multiplying instructions per clock in AMD case but intel is still on the same lane. In my opinion , AMD win this race twice as fast as intel due to its power efficiency , low cache latency and lower price than intel... GOOD JOB AMD , You were the best in 2001 leading in front of intel Pentium 4 now you're in front of intel. Brawo AMD
The Su be smooth
Intel fans🤪
This video has the greatest chromatic aberration i have ever seen!
so they've won, goodbye intel :(
High performance and low price They called AMD
When 4000 series APU launch in India
Nothing amazing, AT I  WAS EXPECTED 😱😳😑😑👀
Tempting presentation AMD, but as a X370 motherboard owner i feel you let me down, so you are not getting my money this time...
Where is 4000 series
Powerful or not , their prices are really good
im mad that it is Zen 3 and not Z3n
Powerful or not , their prices are really good
I would hate to be working at Intel now, have had AMD for the last 3 years they Rock
I NEED ANSWERS Ive allways been on AMD systems except my very first Pentium 133, all I thought about when I watched this video was. WHY, does CEO Dr Lisa Su wear elegant highheel stiletto, when she got such a plain sweather and pans on.
AMD <3
When’s next thread ripper
Game over ........     ..... ... (for intel)
AMD Is A Threat To The Existence Of Intel
jiji
Dear Amd, i am very disappointed when it comes to new amd ryzen 5000 cpus pricing, its way too expensive even for leadership performance. don't BE GREEDY LIKE INTEL AMD, YOU ARE NOT INTEL AMD!!!!!
I use Radeon 530 Mobile and still excited
AMD!!!! 🤩🤩 We love you!!
The reason i switched to amd was the price preformance, about the new prices im not so happy, 10600k 270 euro in my country, not sure if 5600x will be worth over 10600k, lets wait and see, also there isnt good cooler included anymore, what will happen to zen 4? 50% price incrase?
What will the next gen of laptop processors be? Ryzen 9? I’m not a huge PC guy so this is not trolling I’m just asking
What if the ryzen 5 3600 price got drop 100$
901 dislikes are Intel die hard fanboys, or could be Intel employees in disguise. Meanwhile... Intel's in competition with Lasko for heater business.
Amd didnt kill intel. Amd 5800x 8c/16t $450 Amd 5600x 6c/12t $350 Intel 10700 8c/16t $320 Intel is the cheaper option especially for gamers. To get 8 cores you have to pay $450 for amd to get it,whereas intel has it for way cheaper. Spend thr extra cash on a better gpu.
5600x will cost ♂three hundred bucks ♂
My daughter is very young and she seems to be very interested in technology. I created a big poster of you (Lisa su) and other remarkable females and put it in her room
Upcoming>>  Coffinlake: intel inside
how does it feel like the GeForce RTX 3090 combined with the AMD a9 5600 a really amazing game so we can't imagine
RIP  Intel
This coincides nicely with my PC build research. Honestly even without this announcement I'd go with AMD. Over the years they've offered me the most bang for my buck. I remember when they were the computing world's step kid but look at them now. We'll see what Intel has up its sleeve soon enough.
Imagine seeing this 100 years later and thinking : pftttt
You had me at "Gamers are not dead."
Lmao Xbox series s (8-core cpu) = 300$ 5600x (6-core cpu) = 300$ AMD pretty much joking on PC users.
AMD,YES
Prices are unsatisfied.
AMD Yes!!!!!
any idea i didn't find the driver section?
Oh yeah baby let's gooooooo!
Lisa is soo cool
The chip runs at 1080p I like my games running 4K
Wait i having been gaming this whole time?!?!?!
You guys didn't showed any laptop cpu
I recently cancel intel i9 processor from Amazon , because amd unlimited bit to intel , Intel goes to titles in game processor.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💘💘💘💘💝💝💝💝💝
AMD > Intel
Amd: bye bye intel! Intel: Linus pls sponsor we can’t get good. Amd: *puts intel in its coffin* and thats done lol. *and so Linus gets amd sponsor for once!*
Ok, now I want rtx 3070 and 16 gb ram with ryzen cpu in my g531gt with i7 and gtx 1650. But in Australia, computer stores don’t play fair and they quintuple the price. So idk ):
perfect performance after Zen 2... should CPU like this,, update new model, update architecture, update performance,, maybe next with feature AI CPU Desktop / Laptop...
А я интел люблю
Wraith Prism included?
AMD loves me and I love AMD
I think 20 years later amd will have the FIRST 1NM CPU!
AMD Radeon 6000 series release date:28 Oct 2020 18 more dayz ✓ 17 more dayz ✓ 16 more dayz 15 more dayz 14 more dayz 13 more dayz 12 more dayz 11 more dayz 10 more dayz 9 more dayz 8 more dayz 7 more dayz 6 more dayz 5 more dayz 4 more dayz 3 more dayz 2 more dayz 1 more dayz Note: i will update this thing every day
Originally i wanted an i7-10700K due to the singlethread perfomance for music production and gaming, now it's a weird time when AMD has better singlethread than Intel and surpassed the 10900K, low latencies.....   Whaaaaaaa?!?! AMD is now the king after 14 years of Intel's dominance, Zen 3 is unreal.
I love you Lisa su
watching this using 10900k
I now understand why Intel was talking about nothing other than AMD during their reveal. They knew they could put on their own show, so they previewed AMD for us
AMD>>>>INTEL
Intel you're out
We knew their cpu's were going to wipe the floor with intel over a year ago but it's their gpu's I am looking to now to keep nvidia honest because as good as the 3080 is, its still over priced.
AMD: wanna hear a joke ? i captured the gaming market Intel:  I did't get it? AMD: YES exactly Intel: wait... what??
Zen 3 will put Intel csgo teams at a huge disadvantage hahaha. 46% increase over 3900x - holy s%*t!
Show us more GOOD AMD laptops!
누님 키가.. 175는 되보이시는데
Team Red!!!
Nvidia CEO- Asian AMD CEO- Asian  Let that sink in.
Imagine when amd release their 5nm series!!!!! Good lord.
Wait a mInute! Is that Jensen Huang of Nvidia in drag??
Intel: Check AMD: Mate
Idk man, I've always favored AMD in desktops even back when you guys were the "underdogs" but I can't validly justify spending $75 more to get an 5800X over a 10700K
If AMD doesn't forget about the low spec gamers (Ryzen 3, APUs and Athlons), Intel is RIP.
RIP intel
i have ryzen 5 3550h how is it
And the prices rise. :'(
Andddd here comes the price hike
14:20 here comes saitama
Amd is the best
You great Company AMD.Thanks for Given to Us Best Choice ...🙂
New episode for techno tuesday @Pinoy Knows Tech
Dislikers are who use Intel 🤣🤣
If there is no support for X470 Taichi I am not upgrading, and by the time i am forced to upgrade, you may not have the best product on the market.
\m/_ 😏 _\m/
I hate trailer music so much.
I hope the make a brand new APU's as well
AMD is awesome
Why couldn’t we have this on the ps5 omg imagine its in the ps5 pro 🤯
Looks like the final nail is in the coffin and it’s got Intel inside
AMD is now killing there own cpu's because INTEL is already dead        *N A N I*
Hope you liked that joke on overpriced heaters called Intel processors. Been building my PCs for about 20 years. I have used AMD, every since my first PC melted. Gaming for 8 hrs day really gave intel workout. So I went AMD, it has been long and a joy to build and play. I have all my chips from all my built PCs, on my 3rd. It's the dependability really that has kept me with AMD, both processors, and video cards. Since I'm not moving anymore. Trying water cool for both this build. Can't wait till all is together processor, Motherboard, Ram, video card. Ok guys I will now begin on Nov 5th, getting the 5950X time for rebuild.
All the dislikes are intel fanboys
yang termurah $299, setelah masuk toko di Indonesia jadi 5jt++
lmao AMD is going to be on 5nm and Intel will still be on 14nm...... How the hell did they get so far behind?
Ok ty AMD, rocking! um knock on door it was Intel delivering my pizza hut order.
Its amazing what we can do when we combine our efforts into the whole of the world and innovate our way into the future. Imagine where we would be now if our forefathers would have build bridges instead of bombs.
A win for gamers
I don't understand this computer stuff. Are they competing with Intel only or Nvidia too? Does that mean I don't need a gpu for gaming? Anyone please explain.
All I can say is the price will go up as we progress no more cheap anymore.
Tuey should understand now ,increasing prices with same specs now wont give them more customers , people aint fool now . They will immediately switch to intel jist like they came here from intel before .
I want to change my processor to amd but i am afraid of heat
Whooshhh👍👍
My pc is 🥔
I just Bought Ryzen 5 3600 3days ago AMD : Just released Ryzen 5000 series
Why Battlefield V (dx12) is  -3% ?
Well, intel, you had a good run.      ¸,.-•-.,¸          ¸,.-•-.,¸  •¸`      -.,¸      •¸`     -.,¸     'º*•*º'         'º*•*º'
man i always used to buy amd knowing they were just a tick behind intel but the price made it worth it. Then i finally got on the intel bandwagon i5 i7 stuff im glad amd is back to kicking ass ill go home next purchase!
2019, Intel delivered revenue of $72.0 billion,  This compares to only $6.7 billion in net revenue for AMD. in the end everyone in that room will go and buy Intel  CHIPS i am sure  they Used Intel based computers to Develop  ryzen --  the proof is in the numbers if amd was that great they would have blown past Intel in market share AMD was founded in 1969 and after 51 years they are barely making 7billion in revenue Intel started in 1968 and as of today they are at 73billion  - THE  WORLD CHOSES INTEL FOR QUALITY CHIPS
Cool but sad it will be more expensive that earlier
Any idea when is TR 5000 coming out?
Intel's only appeal to me over AMD is Optane memory. Loses on every other front, and especially price. PCIE 4.0 may or may not come in the next gen. Intel expressed no interest, but they may have to for the sake of keeping up with the numbers. Right now a top end Ryzen with a 3090 looks most appealing. I only used Intel's since 1989 and I must say, for the first time I'm considering jumping ship. AMD is winning me over. Great presentation. And thanks for not making political statements and just focusing on the product.
2017: OH GET INTEL 2020: WHATS INTEL??? TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!
im just here to know the cheapest apu that will replace the 3200g
All those dislikes, are Intel supporters.
Rip intel 👁👄👁
the dislike are from intel fanboy
1 Of Good Commonly Day News To Hear
God bless Amd 🙏🏽 ....
Fun fact : Investors do not understand technology, but they like lines that go up.
AMD Yes!
So much nanameters
I have put off buying new parts for my new pc just for this i realy hope amd has worked out the issues nvidia had for there launch so scalpers dont ruin it i want the 5900x cpu and 6000s gpu on nov 5th
Watched the entire thing. Don't understand a single word. Can I put this chip in my 🧠
Guess I'll do what's right when my next motherboard and CPU upgrade happens. They really put on a great nonchalant presentation.
なんでこの動画が急上昇になってないんだろう？
Can it run X-Plane or FS2020 at max settings? I notice that most flight simmers use Intel
Would be awesome if the new chips would finally support mediated GPUs like Intel and Nvidia. There is no real competitor to Intel's GVTg for the consumer market.
Fin fact : in my country the prices*3  ...
An oligopoly is better than a monopoly, but it's not enough. There needs to be more CPU companies, preferably democratic.
lol the beginning is like a movie trailer
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
Pinche lisa c mamo, precios kk alv, es de geis subirle precios solo porque no tienen competencia por ahora. Ahora Intel tiene más chance ptm.
Price of the 5950x and 5900x is what people use to build an entire budget gaming  pc
RIP: here lies Intel, thanks for being overpriced and still not better than amd for 3 long years just for being a little faster. At least you could be overclocked easier than amd.
RIP Intel. You had a good run.
He's dead he's dead
Not really related to the AMD Processor, but seriously Dr. Lisa Su has overseen one of the greatest Rags-to-Riches stories, bringing AMD back from the disaster of the Bulldozer era. Why does she like NEVER get credit in the press as being an amazing woman CEO (An amazing CEO period, but let's play their game for a minute). Instead they (The corporate press) focus on Lunatics who run their business into the ground and eat dog food for clout.
I hope this release finally gets amd the market share they deserve. I really wish there was some high end laptop for gaming with amd other than the Asus g14. I also hope that the big navi card will finally be able to hang with Nvidia's 3080 instead of being left in the dust
i subscribed just becouse in 6 months i will be able to build a pc with your amd ryzen 5 3600
Me that doesn't even have a pc
When you believed you were sealed until the day of redemption .  Jesus died for our sins on the cross , was buried , and rose again on the third day and because of this you are saved.
Going from a 1700 is gonna be quite the jump by the looks of it.
omg
dammit the 5800x is 450 the 5600x is legit the 3700x
17:40 why does Battlefield V have a 3% dip
Im gonna comment this video, And i declare, this is a historical moment in *g a m i n g* history.
Damn this was so honest they didn't even hide that -3% in Battlefield 5. That is unusually transparent.
AMD: Do you trust Zen 3? Me: With every cell in my body
Yikes intel may be in trouble here
Yo fat rip to intel
*new product* New company: “We did this... we did that” All I hear is: “$$ $$$ $$$$...$$ $$$ $$$$”
I'm gonna need a 5700X ASAP
Can Dr. Lisa Su do for my life what she has for AMD?
What are we supost to do with zen 2 procesors that we buyed from last year?
It's amazing to see once dying amd to be market leaders
Intel is dead

Kalau dipikir-pikir kotak gitu doang, tapi harganya bisa buat beli beras berbulan-bulan ... hmm
Intel's new code name, coffin lake.
With the savings you get from AMD processors you can afford to buy a fire extinguisher when they inevitably start an electrical fire in your PC case. Thanks AMD!
5 nm in design Intel quit the competition 😂
lol...28% improvement. So, from $1.00 to $1.25. What was the GPU setup? Some crossfire nonsense that will only ever work with one game?
Sorry Mr. Hallock, but if I'm shelling out for a 5900X, I'm not putting it in a system designed to play at 1080p.
Im still over here rocking my 2700x and b450 board.
It’s all fun and games until we reach gen 4 and the npc and ai start living their own lives with choices
Ive hated amd for years!!  Took a  chance on a 3900 in my new alienware ryzen edition ................... LOVE IT YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE PICKED UP ON A BEAUTIFUL CEO AND TEAM!  Im very impressed!! Waiting to see the gpu cards and how they stand up to nvidia
AMD: We are doing stuff. iNTEL: We better take notes. Nvidia: We sit back and watch.
AMD still kicking ass.  Even Intel fans should be excited, cause this is going to force them to get off their butts to keep in the game here.    Very happy with my 4800h by the way.
I really respect her a lot ❤️

Ma'am APU ????????
gg intel
ULTAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!COMBOOOOO!!!!!!
AMD,YES!
My 8600k is looking at me with fear...
amd for me was all about the price...its a bit shocking to see this hike in prices
It would funny if she did this keynote from her kitchen like Jensen LOL
10:04 Love how they show the "competitor" as a flat line. AMD throwing some shade with this one.
at this point amd is just competing with itself
Intel fan be like:  Wait... there are no intel fans..
Intel, Nvidia, AMD... all is just show. We awaited this kind of performance many, many years ago.We have been pushed into "micro-step" hypes. The truth is, that they cannot achieve what we all know is achievable. Technology is going to die soon, if there is no mayor breakthrough in the next 24 months.
Please add more supplies to India, prices are too high almost double of intel due to low supply
2:27 freedom!
It's insanely sad the people who have literally the highest end personal computing hardware on the market, yet still run lowest settings on literally every game for "MAX FRAMES" You might as well NOT dish out for the highest end hardware and you can STILL run lowest settings allowed.  "BRO I just spent $30,000 on this new PC, it has the best gear money can buy, I CAN'T WAIT to see World of Warcraft on lowest settings man, omfg the FRAMES!!!!!!"
Im from poor country (Ukraine), i barelly have money for food and clothes. But i dream some day to be able to buy modern AMD cpu.
no 5700x 65w part coming ?
i didn't even consider building a pc until i learned about ryzen.
I wish Dr. Lisa Su was my mom dam i would get a good pc then
Intel is finished
Nvidia the master race
Lisa Su rocks
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps.  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.
If you stoppped making it one inch big, and made it say 2, 3, 4 inches bigger?! could you fit 20+ years of power in it and just sell it to us now?!
Please tell me there’s just gonna be a 5600
INTEL ARMY <3
the breathing...
AMD: "Where Gaming Begins" Pong: "Am I a joke to you?"
good work AMD. I'm happy :-)
I really like AMD, but her nasally voice is the worst.
dope now I can get a i7 10700k even cheaper
I go back to an Athlon 64 2.2 and my starting card with AMD was a 800XT --- up to a 3900x and 5700XT. After seeing this, i cant say thank you all. You provided a better product than you competition and so much of a better price point. I lost faith in AMD when I had a APU 6800 and switched to and I-5 3470k. I watch the market and what you all have done in 3 years is simply amazing! I try to go off Price per frame as a gamer, after seeing the stats and prices i will purchase a 5900. As far the market goes, i would love to see you beat Nvidia. Everyone said you couldn't beat or come close to intel in 2012-2016. You all have done it and didn't jack your prices up to drive your market value up. Your market is growing and your products are taking over. Thats what "I" love to see!!!
Intel fan boys are suddenly quiet
Bravo 👏🏻 nailed it 🔥
AMD just focused  presenting in their products I did not heard the word "competitor" unlike Intel launch.
And there goes Intel fan base disliking this video!!!Lmao
and people still make fun of amd for needing a fire extinguisher to cool it down. Good one intel fanboys
If there's a war between two Intel processors, amd always wins.
This Sound Great but Qualcomm SnapDragon is gaining momentum that’s why AMD need to come out with Ryzen! It’s great for all Consumer
Im saving me cash for intels new chip deadlake.
November 5th??? Thats 2 days after the election in the US. We might be full on hot Civil War and hot war with China by then. This is not a good date to release something not this year.
Intel: *This isn't my final form yet!*
Will there be a more budget focused CPU based on Zen3? Ideally something aimed at the R5 2600/2600x? That would surely cripple team blue, as they have the i5-7600f over you guys.
I'm still using an intel processor from 2012 and my next upgrade will definitely be an AMD processor
INTEL had there time now a new star has arrived
Will Radeon RX 6000 series beat RTX 3080 ? I'll be the most happiest person in the world if it beats.
Amd: Doom Eternal intel: The Imp
Congrats AMD. Competition is great.
Good presentation. I am excited about AMD after watching this.
Intel🤮 AMD IS SUPERIOR👑
Nice CPU's but 100,-- increase to cheapest 6 Core and 120,-- and an increase to the cheapest 8 Core is in my Opinion a big disapinting fact.
AMD sí evoluciona de verdad ♥️
Me encanta ver estos vídeos con tecnología tan avanzada, que lastimosamente no puedo tener 😢
No audience due to corona scare and false pandemic, very sad, very depressing, the world is a sad place with a lot of spineless and crazy people. If tyranny ever comes to America it will be in the form of medical dictatorship a wise man once said, well he was absolutely correct, a prophetic sentence, the only problem is it's not just the USA, the whole world is under medical tyranny.
Instead of trying to invent and make the best PC with the best amd processors or all the outher stuff try make a fcking pc that cheap and affordable with realy good software I'm broke asfk it's a pay to win out there now .
"we know you're going to wait for benchmarks..." thats quite a confident statement, I like it :-)
815 people have already bought intel
Donburi O ;)
Amd is likeeee the One plus among phones, going against Samsung and Iphone i LOVE IT
Guauuu! Sensacional.
what the
Intel : me motherchod hu Jo isme aya hu
Disliked for the price increase over Zen 2. Don't be greedy AMD . According to Steam hardware survey, your CPU market share is only about 23% . Your priority should be capturing market share from Intel, not jack up the price when you see yourself having a small advantage over your competition.
I think nividia 3090 is still better 8k at 60fps
Please keep pricing same or a little above not much 🥺
I keep wanting to upgrade but you keep getting better and better quicker than I can save :~)
AMD is like Eminem, it's just competing itself
Intel is dead
Intel Left the Earth!
Next CPU is going to be AMD forsure.
Please keep the price the same... I cannot buy process every 2 years
Intel has left the chat...
they mocked me for getting an am4 motherboard and not an intel. WELL WHOS LAUGHING NOW
:)
Intel? wtf is Intel?
*Instructions unclear , hand ended up in the blender*
*Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads*
My next station is Zen 3 🤍
Take a shot every time she says gaming
mark papermasters' breathing, sounds like my Audi's turbo
AMD overtake intel
Proud owner of Ryzen! Choke on that Intel ya greedy corpos
Glad I switched to AMD 3900X a month ago.
Please, bring stock for AMD GPU ! Do that and you will win alot of customers ;)
Good bye Intel
For gaming cheap amd..... = choose ps5/xbox s X 😁 only $500  Because ryzen + radeon in PC maybe  need more $1000 (only 2 part)
please let this be good, I own a bunch of stocks in amd....
Intel and Nvidia so nuul     Amd is the best zen 3 is the best amd the best
Enthusiasts don't run single player games in 1080p tho.... Give me that msfs 2020 benchmark please
👉👍👈

Intel fanbois crying in the corner
If only the prices weren't so high..
Aww my B350 won't do anymore if I upgrade to Zen 3. Ah well... What are you gonna do. It's a shame I'd have to spend more money but it's good they're not holding back on progress.
Wonderful now we can overpay for both Intel and AMD.
Just installed an X570 board two weeks ago. I had a feeling it was a good move. Currently running a 2600X, can't wait for the 5600X.
The Threadrippers and the 5950X are gonna be interesting

i will defenetly get a big navi if nvidia dosen't step up
I am waiting for the big navi review  to build my pc for the first time and I am really wishing that they set the price for big navi not more than 499 dollar. My choice for cpu is definitely going to be AMD.
stonks
i need one of them

I owned in total 3 amd cpus and was never satified. so since 2004 iv run with intel. and was hooked since then. now when its time im thinking of 10900k intel cpu becouse i dont want to be disepointed again.
Intel - You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of performance, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me, that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will evolving.  AMD - Yep. We’re all kinds of stubborn.  Intel - I’m thankful. Because now I know what I must do. I will shred these cpus down to its last atom. And then, with the technology you’ve collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with performance, but knows not what it has upgraded, but only what it has been given. An expensive cpus.  AMD - Born out of lies.  Intel - They’ll never know it. Because you won’t be proves to tell them.  Intel - I am inevitable. [he snaps his fingers and nothing happens, realizes the performance are not in the CPUs]  AMD - And I am AMD Ryzen.
Now we can understand why intel cpus were always expensive 😅
I never came harder at a YouTube video than pornhub.
👏🖤🔥
Drop prices by 50$ and it would be ok.
2020: Pandemics and 0 stock in PS5s, Nvidia 3000s, AMD 5000 and possibly Radeon GPUs as well XD
Why was 4000 skipped as this is the 4th gen?
OK- I didn't realize AMD had BOTH consoles- lmfao ouch!
787 Intel employees disliked this-
Porque subieron los precios ? Porque ahora son mejor que Intel? Ya se ve que estos son iguales inflar precios poco a poco , al final un procesador R5/i5, costarán más de 300€ y eso es una locura
+ $50 and no cooler box amd is The New intel
Atm if you are not a linux obsessed guy , there is no reason for not buying amd over intel.
i love my ryzen 3700x
thank you thank you thank you thank you 3000
Ready Player One is not so far...
Bintel destroyed 🤯🤯🤯
Who else was waiting for  Ryzen 3 5000 series CPU???
I'm gonna build with this cpu       when all the parts become obsolete and cheap
The dislikes are from Intel fanboys.
А будет ли поддержка на b450 чипсете? will there be support on the b450?
watching this while still using intel 2500k :||
800 dislikes are from Intel Employees 🤣
The end of intel. AMD TAKING OVER big time!!!
So crazy, AMD really did change themselves around compare to 15 years ago.  More excited even though I like my 2700x
When Zen5 will release Hope Every One will Be Visiting My channel....😌 No so fun fact: I have Amd Processor 😌
only hope that radeon will be not paper release like nvidia did
19% higher ipc they say. I really want to see the real benchmarks.
amd cpu price is stepping up ! I can see the future when AMD will cost double what Intel Offers!
Take my money!!!!!
Intel is nowhere near the foot of amd. Not a Intel hater not a amd lover. I just wrote what is correct at this point of time.
i should slam my i7 10700k to the floor
I wonder which of Nvidia GPUs that AMD used to compare 3900xt and 5900
I just bought an r7 3700x 😑🤦
Intel: releases 10th gen Amd: *execute order 66*
at this point, intel should just give up
Круть ❤️
So how much more powerful would these things be than a R5 3600? Should I upgrade?
I've been using Intel i7 CPUs since sandy bridge....if the benchmarks hold up I'll be moving to Zen3 in November.
do we want this? YEEEEEESSSS!.... do we need this? NOOOOOOOOO!
The price the price. 😅👌👍🙏
Intel is preparing a huge surprise in 2021......
$299 USD wow, thats less than how much  we have to fork over or  the mere Ryzen 3600 6core processor here in africa..                     Touche America.................
i have ryzen 3 3100 and it dont even go above 50% of usage in gaming with rx 570 i think it was a very good choice
I am still enjoying my 2700X that I bought new back when it released - Would upgrading to one of the newer chips work on my MSI - X470 M7AC?
Dislikes: Intel employees... Likes: Those who love epic processors!
*Intel has left the chat*
😍⁦❤️⁩⁦❤️⁩⁦❤️⁩
Been an Intel fan for a long time. But now I just bought my very first pc and I'm glad I've chosen AMD :)
Can someone explain for the people, who dont get, what it is?
Amazing come back. Very well earned. Intel has raped our wallets long enough with mediocre improvements. Way to go AMD
ayee lets goooo i can finally play pub g without stutters XD
Can we take 2 minute silence for intel...? RIP Intel  8-10-2020
Lisa Su for Nobel prize!!!!!!! For giving us quality and performance on CHEAP !
always chose amd cpu and gpus likes only amd lover
AMD WINS !!!
im still gonna use intel i like the motherboards more sry
Intel can NEVER catch a w bro I kinda feel bad.
AMD is freaking HOT
Intel is 🦀————🦀       Gone
Waiting for Radeon gpu
*R I P  INTEL*
Waiting for my Intel PC to die so I have an excuse to get AMD
I like AMD becoz AMD provide better               performance than intel in terms of price and also for multitasking and gaming😍😍carry on👌👌
Best thing for me being amd fan
Intel only cheats, amd does it, if it's not kicked in, Intel won't give you a core
I'm still on FX-8350 & 4.4Ghz with Vega56 and so f sad that I don't have enough money to upgrade CPU... And I'm now programming f graphic-engine on this s setup, but proud that after 6 years I still can run most games in FHD with 60fps. Im trying to optimize it for multi-rore cpus without leading thread and its absolutly awesome that now IPC is even faster so threads should synchronize better.  AMD absolutly killed the competiton, I'm proud ;)
Intel: We can't beat AMD. AMD: Fine, I'll do it myself.
AMD to Intel - I'm about to end this company's whole career
Ohh boiii yesterday i wanted to get intel now i want amd lol
Should've put Zen 3 in next gen consoles they're pretty much now on par with intel performance with the same node
What women think men want: Bobs and vegene  What men really want:
Intel still da best
Honestly  i'm a fan of Price & Performance  Not Colors, that being said  Zen 2 was Tremendous, Zen 3 sounds like it fixes alot of the  fussiness, etc ... i built Two Ryzen systems this year ( Ryzen 5 3600 & Ryzen 7 3700x ) almost a year now and i'm pleased with Amd  keep up you're Great hard work & Please don't forget us little Consumers when you reach the top  🥂
keep RYSING  prices
Lol don't buy this new cpu, wait like a month or two and they'll make another new cpu 25 % faster than this
Is my birthday 10.28
No amd yes intel
Yea but can it run STALKER 2
Even 249 dlls for the Ryzen 5, could be good. But no. :)
AMD: sets new single thread record in Cinebench r20 Also AMD: break its own record 5 mins later Intel: hey thats illegal
Perfect but the prices seem concerning tbh. AMD has always been about being affordable and I highly respect them for it but tbh I'm worried their breakthroughs might make them the very enemy they swore to destroy. If Ryzen 9 5950x is 7% faster than intel i9 10900k, let's not forget that it is also 48% more expensive...
10600k will still beat the 5600
trust me im an engineer!
Remeber remeber the 5th of November.
I'll trade you my i9-9900k. Feeling the AMD Domination.
Too expensive for me
i could feel dr lisa su stepping on the intel ceo with those heels 🤣 lol
Intel:"Why dada, WHY?"  AMD:"*business*"
... The Ryzen 5 now costs more than a 3rd gen Ryzen 7, Even with all these benefits, I think I'm gonna stick with my plan to upgrade to a 3rd gen Ryzen 7... Either way, it's gonna be a huge upgrade from my Ryzen 3 2300X.
I love when she said gaming begins with amd
Next in line, AMD will fix driver issues, can't wait.
Sounds a lot like a apple event....
Why i feel like she is our mom giving us Christmas gifts?
Intel be like 89 year old AMD be like covid
Its kind of good to see that AMD is not just comparing its new cpus to Intel but to also their own so people know what improved. Unlike intel's presentation of their 11th gen where they just frickin compare it with ryzen and not their own.
This is the new empress... She really Rizen AMD in ways that both Nvidia and Intel push efforts to top her standards...
Battlefield V -3% 🤔
Competition and the free market is why we have such awesome technology. The more Intel, AMD, and Nvidia fight the more the consumer wins.
So what?  Still can't afford it.
Funny stuff: Im a beginning, i didn't like AMD, but i use a computer with AMD. Yet here i am, with my little war AMD machine after three years when i get it... Making the impossible.
basically is AMD vs AMD
Everyone we know intel is gonna do something to beat them
Intel is destroyed
Yaaawn.... find me a summary video!
Intel needs to step up! Still stuck in 10nm to 14nm!!! Amd is already planning to do 5nm! The reason why is because i love a good fight :D
Soon we will have 64 core gaming processors.
well, i think AMD vs intel issue is over
Amd was almost bankrupt but then Lisa su showed up! Damn she's my favourite CEO
My dear friends, lets see our new GPU lineup of 6000 series. Faster than the 3090. At half the price. Now it's time to upgrade.
GAY-MIN! GAY-MIN!
Upcoming Intel CPU....   Coffin Lake Intel inside
INTEL IS TRASH AMD FOR LIFE
She is the undertaker for intel.
my next laptop is going to amd 🤗🤗
Anyone else looking to sell Intel CPU/MoBo by 11.5?
Come on Intel you had one last job. Single Thread performance, you couldn't even beat AMD in that. Now lower the prices or GTFO here
LAUNCH IT  ON BANGLADESH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
Rip Intel
Intel: We can't beat AMD. AMD: Fine, I'll do it myself.XD
Steve Heijl, thank you for this quite inspiring speech. As a mechanic/engineer myself.... this touched my heart.
This music makes me that I have achieved something in my life🤙
There's almost nothing AMD beats INTEL At........except one        The PRICE.... THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE....     BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL FRUSTATED THAT INTEL IS DOING NOTHING........SAY WHAT YOU SAY..  THOUGH I USE A AMD CPU BUT STILL WILL REMAIN A "INTEL FAMBUOY"
Lisa Su strong!
I am very happy/  Soon, i hope i will be able to buy cheap 3950x, for my upgrade path, from 2700x processor ;P
Her voice like ”Cortana ”
Rtx3080 + Ry5900X = ❤️
I would really like if amd creates its own fpga line
i just love that competition innovation fuel
I didnt know intel fanboys hated intel that much
Dont forget to like, subscribe and comment for more videos!!!

I have intel cpu but for some reason I absolutely cheer for amd
When will they release RTX 3080 competitor graphics card
1ccx only 8 care speed no got 5 gigahertz more than 105 W more expensive less performance CPU GPU in game to it will be shot in the legs of AMD they can close the company and go home
without AMD, we would be on Intel quad core 1.8 Ghz for $600
WORD!!
Intel :i am Gaming King 👑 AMD: oomywa ei muu shindeiru Intel: naani
Lol intel
Everyone: There is no 5ghz processor from AMD yet.       AMD FX 9590: Am I a joke to you?
Someone explain to me wtf they are saying, is it good cpu or no
I like 2 lisas  1 lalisa manoban 2 lisa su
The prices are fire 🔥😂
common intel do something
i freakin love amd
Me: Nice Also me: *cringe laughs with R5 2600 smirk...
Minutes before this video:       Intel: why do I hear boss music?
I kind of feel bad for Intel. Apple is making their own CPUs now and AMD is beating them in the only thing left they were winning at which is gaming. the only thing I was a little disappointed with is the lack of 5700X since I was going to build within a budget and was planning on getting whatever the 3700X replacement was. I can't really give up more $$$ for the 5800X since I am investing all my extra budget on the GPU since it's a gaming pc build. And I don't want a 6-core because future proofing dictates that 8 cores is the sweet spot. Might have to rethink my build or end up with Intel after all.
After 25+ years of Intel CPUs, I'm ready for the Ryzen 5900X.
Amd has rizen
Intel got steve job'd...AMD  pulling a sculley.....hail x86
I am an intel fanboy and I actually liked this video
I love Ryzen...👍👍. Intel is slower and much expensive.👍
Ruskel AMD CEO🔥🔥
AMD's gole to give us the worst 😂😂😂..AMD why are you feeling lie . Why you make us fool by introducing waste products..   Intel's tiger lake will kick you soon😎😎
Nice AMD it reminds me when I got The Amd cup 64 bit cpu back in 2005 or in 2006. It's still great today. Good on you. 🙌
Hmm price hike
The price increase is a massive turn off, even if the performance does beat intel in gaming. Almost any modern CPU already gives great gaming performance and feels like we are just beating a dead horse at this point
GO AMD . A-M-D ! A-M-D !! A-M-D!!!
No leather jacket? Is the meme dead?
Hi! is there a way to get a high quality download of this presentation?
Building my first pc last week was a mistake
i just bought stock :P
Intel needs help
AMD,YES！
INSTRUCTION PER COCK>????
:(( too bad I don't have the money to upgrade from an i5 2400
is this a movie holeeeee
AMD : release the kraken Ryzen
Please be more powerful than Nvidia. Sick of the one horse race.
AMD is the ultimate underdog... Intel has dropped the ball too many times, no wonder even Apple is abandoning them.
It has been fifteen years guys since 2005.
AMD FTW!
AMD Board: So Dr. Su, what now? Dr. Su: *execute Order 66*
I want AMD to be listed only Single precision floating point processing GPU

Shut up and take all my moneyy!!!!
how long intel will be humiliated? lisa : yes...
Love my 3900x, Does everything i need with ease! I will skip this gen but looking forward to doing a system rebuild with DDR5 next
Just waiting for 6900 xD
AMD: We are proud to announce that our CPUs will be powering the PS5 and XBox  *Intel has left the chat*
AMD is just one step closer to almost becoming Skynet.
all nice except that sweater - no no Lisa - you need a nice jacket... just not a leather one :)
AMD is on fire  ....
Tomorrow i am getting my delivery package of AMD Ryzen processor. Im so excited.
i want to see an amd equivalent of the shield.
he is pushing the Limits  Its over 9000              Super Zen 3
What about the GPUs?
My math teacher asked me to write a word problem for some younger kids to solve. This is what I wrote.    Intel's core i5 has a maximum clock speed of 3.7 GHz (please do not judge me if I am incorrect). AMD's Ryzen 5 maximum clock speed is 4.1 GHz. Find the difference in clock speed between Intel's and AMD's CPU.
Ah, yes, the new generation of AMD processors that will obviously beat Intel again...      I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BUY INTEL BUT I WILL BUY AMD LATER HEHEHEHE
Amd for the win baby
At this point, Intel's CEO is gonna go full Gavin Belson!
I could feel passion in AMD but they just seemed so lost so I bought an i7-3770 back in 2012. I will be upgrading my system with AMD soon now.
INTEL is best................. IN side InTeL.
That's one big disappointment for me, only + 6 performance with such a price, now Intel is back to my consideration to upgrade my PC :(
No matter what i always believed that AMD would someday, somehow reach a peak that does not exists for intel and intel will not be ready.
Amd u are number 1
Love the retro content!
Great for enthusiasts not as great for those on a budget
wowwwww
AMD is ruling now
ALWAYS BELIEVED. ALWAYS BOUGHT AMD. WILL ALWAYS BUY AMD.
Will there be 5400g Apu ??? @AMD

Im just hoping that the ryzen 3 3100 can go cheaper. I'm broke AF and I really need a PC for school
AMD keeps on RYZEN !!!
Is Lisa Su a woman?
its just no use watching amd because in india all laptops are intel
Fairchild Semiconductor - Is smiling :)
way to rub it in intel's face
Thanks AMD for turning intel into to a underdog for the first time. I can't wait for the time intel comes back with a better and cheaper options. Its really better for us that you compete and make better products.
intel go ded
What Lisa Su has done for AMD is incredible. Good thing I bought AMD shares back when they were 13$.  Massive respect for her.
Wow, Bravo AMD. btw, I love her shoes. Rock it Girl!!!
AMD is absolutely setting the bar high.  Really happy for them as a company.
There are still no 14 or 13 inch  laptops available in India with 4800U or 4800HS. Intel still rules laptop market in India.
rip intel

Did AMD raid Area 51?
If this is what Zen 3 Ryzen looks like, Zen 3 Threadripper will scare you.
By the way......Background sound likes Avengers End Game!!!
If Intel doesn't do anything soon, and very soon, they will become some weird side brand. Intel won't be used for benchmarks anymore, Ryzen will be mainstream, and the new Nvidia cpus they announced they were going to do *might* be the competition. If Intel wants to still be in competition, they need to combat Ryzen, fast
so basically Amd vs Intel & Amd vs Amd?
Lisa Su you are my Hero...I waited years to see AMD get the Crown! You deserve this Lisa...You deserve this AMD...We deserve this also....Hail to the King!
Time to upgrade my AMD FX-8350:q
Unifying L3 could interefere in performance on another kinds of workloads like productivity?
I want make a review, urgent.
i wanna see the 1% lows.

A LONG AWAITED KING! OLD KING IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE KING!
as i mainly just playing csgo on my pc (i3-9100f) and considering to upgrade, this presentation convince me enough to move to amd :D
🤯
@AMD - One question. You just revealed the Mainstream CPUs. Can you let us know when you'll make an announcement of when you will reveal the new HIGH-END DESKTOP THREADRIPPER SERIES 5000 CPUs?  This is important for me as I need to decide whether to buy the 5950x or wait for the new 32-Core Threadripper.  Crossing fingers that THREADRIPPER will cross that 5ghz line on every core.
How good is to see this while having a B450 Tomahawk Max with an 2600. THIS is what future proof means! Freedom for overclock without the BS to buy another damn motherboard.

big money
this is the woman, we actually need in world and a company like AMD.
Lisa Su is the BOSS
Will linus tech tip make a vid of this?
Im so glad I went with AMD 💪🏼
Goood jaab amd
No bullshit, on point presentation
The only thing i was expecting from amd is clock speed. They should have made their processors to achieve 5.0 Ghz.
Lisa Didi Price Thoda Kam Karooooo!         😒🤪😅

Intel CEO: Let's talk about our +3% in Battlefield
Looks like a software pitch for nikola, endless talk and no visual realistic presentation
Why does she speak so loudly ? There is no one else in the room.  But honestly. I think the pricing is a bit high on the new processor. If I'm going to pay Intel prices, I may as well just buy Intel.
This is what you call a PogChamp

All Intel youtubers in November: right, let’s start with the only benchmark that really matters ... Battlefield V ... all right, thanks for watching guys.
I've been waiting for this tipping point. An actual upgrade to my 6700K with these past 4 years of Intel sitting on their arse's. And going from Cinebench alone it's a 50% SC performance upgrade while simply having more cores while we're at it. But I'm still holding off since I imagine we'll see DDR5 paired with 5nm next year with hopefully a nice boost to the Infinity Fabric performance on multi-CCX chips.  I also have mad respect for AMD actually showing Battlefield V versus the 10900K being a loss. Yeah, it was one stat and a small one at that. But even that tiny little thing is unheard of for any company to admit.  And that Big Navi teaser has me hyped. Unfortunately I have to admit that I don't have any choice but to stick with Nvidia due to AI image/video processing applications being built on CUDA with some beginning to incorporate Tensor Cores. Nvidia also comes with a better video encoder. Until AMD can fight on these fronts and entice developers to incorporate AMD GPU support in AI workloads, I won't be able to switch back. But I think I wont have many problems recommending my friends who purely game to pick up an AMD GPU. Especially if the price and power usage is competitive to the RTX 3080.
Disappointing tbh. I was hoping for zen 3 to compete with zen 2 prices so we could see AMD once again provide extremely competitive prices, but these prices are slotting zen 3 just above all the zen 2 equivalents. I doubt we will see a price drop of zen 2 cpus. When Nividia is doing extremely competitive prices for their gpus, it is a shame that AMD isnt doing the same.
Please add Stereoscopic option on new RADEON gpu. VR games still are very few per a year.

Damn u guys really nailed it...Nvidia you're up  next
Intel: i dont want to live on this planet anymore :p
I wish AMD reach that 5.0Ghz and give us 16c/32t. But this update is enough for me to dreaming have a pc with this chip inside it.

Intel just got whooped! Nvidia: (chuckles) I’m in danger
AMD for life
14:50 From the numbers on the top, i cannot see a 28% increase.. 147 vs 167 more or less...at 1080p.. that is a lot slower than 28%, more like 13% at 1080p.. i am missing something?
Now AMD looking for money and Intel looking for low budget user
Let's play a very fast rapid fire... AMD Ryzen or Intel. What's your opinion.
Well, Intel is not sleeping on its laurels. 11 Gen is here, so,... still in the lead. :D
I knoe only brainy people can answer this... If a wheel has 64 spokes, how many spaces are there between the spokes?
"We will not let up going forward" ... definitely not getting a job at Intel!

Where's Intel ?? 🤣
Well done you've finally caught up with Intel lol...
Congrats amd team
Look at Lisa's huge diamond on that ring. Damn!
I have a 3700X and I can attest how good they are. Coming from a 4670K the upgrade has been night and day.
Watching with 3600
Intel will make a comeback with coffin lake.
Very happy 3950X owner.  May be upgrading.  AMD knocks it out of the park again!
Ryzen🔥🔥
lisa said : 22:36 "by Far, the most powerful gaming gpu we've ever built", from here I realized she just reffered "RX6000" series but in this test, it has possibiity AMD tease us with mid range Tier RX6000 and I hope So and its almost tie with RTX3080 :D

I hate myself for buying an intel i5-10600k
Monster CPU, this make my 3600 look meh 😂
I like amd
No timescale for mobile parts?  That's a shame. You also need to make sure manufacturers put them in premium chassis. Cough..... HP's Spectre....... Cough
intel gonna rage of they watch this video
Porma
that 5950x looks like a great upgrade for my 1950x!
I love this competition, just wish amd makes better graphics cards
AMD the new Apple 🍎
Thank God I waited for this
I thought amd was supposed to be the affordable option??? Guess affordable is a myth now.
AMD: You cant beat me  Intel: I know, but he can   NVIDIA In terms of demand because nvidia has 3000 series gpus are out of stock
LISA ; BYEE iNTEL  ALSO LISA ; NVIDIA YOUR NEXT
I wait amd big navi with ray tracing
I wish I had a bigger salary, so I can invest in AMD stocks. AMD is a killer. I have an Intel processor but I am so glad that the competition is gaining advantage
What you gonna do intel, change your logo again?
Amd yes with lower ghz than intel so intel lose.
me : crying look at this using intel i7 10th gen ;-)
Now it's time to disrupt the GPU market. Come on team red!
Ryzen  much better than InutilInside
The price increase is a no for me. I'll stick with my 2600 then.
23:20 am I the only one who's seeing this or is the game lagging?
but can you finish a game of europa 4 without it being stuck at 5fps in the late game?
Lisa Su is my hero
It seems that all guys hit the dislike buttom are working for Intel...
Where is AMDs version of NUC? I’m really looking for another worthy competitor in that space! They need more mobile chips to grab market share!
Love you AMD
time to upgrade my 2700X without changing the motherboard nice
Can someone say how 5900x have lower clock speed than i9 10900k but better single core performance?
See intel , a woman just kick your ass
Perhaps off-topic, but I really admire a strong woman like Lisa Su, she's inspiring and a classy woman as well. Kudos to her.
Always in Intel’s shadow
CoffinLake: Intel inside
This reminds me of old YouTube, Red vs Blue. But Red is winning
Only thing worse than intel fanboys are fanboys of any kind.
finally i can now afford ryzen 5 2600...
I miss the announcement of an ryzen 3 5300 cpu. I hope there will be one !
AMD, terrific tech company. Lisa Su, terrific boss.
if zen 4 5nm intel is going to die and zen3 is already powerful there the king of cpu!
Now I'm waiting for the last boss, the RX6000 next month.
AMD alwz
RIP Intel Monopoly.
RIP INTEL
AMD can u sponsor me?
Still waiting for Legion to launch their AMD varients in my region. Never going with Intel again. AMD ❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥❄
Now I am intrigued.  Ryzen 5600x or i5 10600k 🤔 almost priced the same
AMD= AWFULLY MADE DEVICES
my next pc will have amd fo sho now
League of legends and cs go? Shame on I amd .
If you listen closely you can hear all the intel fanboys sobbing
Intelll be like:- 1 dislike =100 prayers and 10 years of good health.
cant wait for 5600 cpu,best budget cpu
AMD: this the rx 6000 Fans: no it big navi AMD : ok
why you gave intel change are you with all your mind with this prices😂😂😂
It begins...
the price is bad rizen prossers was famous by what they give you with less money the lanch was bad
Wow the best game changing company that brought us to life and made the 8+ cores with best single thread performance and all together threads performance in the best fair and available price. Seriously, I feel so lucky to have this company in the world, without them we would pay like 500-600$ for an intel trash CPU that would have only 4 cores and would get stuck on high quality games.
Rip intel latest YouTube ad *gaming happens with intel*
I just bought a 3900x, are you serious.............
AMD beats intel, intant price hike despite being the same for manufacturing.
you should make it 20% sounds much better than intel 5% increase
1 million intel employees watching this.
The world needs Asian technicians like nvidea and amd.
can i return my 3950x and add the price difference so to have 5950x?
Amd ryzen op
AMD: "The new Zen 3 will have 19% better IPC than our last generation."   Intel: "Let's do collab videos." 😂😂  - Intel x Tencent - Intel x Dolby - Intel x Dell - Intel x Lenovo - Intel x Amazon  And more 😂😂
Mark papermaster killing intel with thouthands of paper cuts.
Two most passionate persons: Jen-Hsun Huang for GPUs, and Lisa Su for CPUs. RIP Intel XD  Edit: I need a crossover between those two people. Intel in the distance: Overclock voids your warranty! AMD, NVIDIA: Well, ya know what, Intel? Flip off!
Intel goodbye 🤭
Battlefield V -3%は草
Is not important who win between AMD or Intel. Because in the end of the day, we are the true winner in this competition.
Haven’t worked in a couple months guess I gotta go back since it looks like I’m building a new pc boys.
Ryzen means AMD "Ryzn to Action" coutesy Lisa
so happy to see AMD on top they deserve it
raising prices and removing cooler nice profit gap for amd and huge wallet hole for us
What's your goal?  AMD: '' give you the best'' and beat intel until we have no competition.  Then what? AMD: Being intel...
What about ryzen 3 5000 siries?
lol 12:51 ? montage cutted a little bit too hard
cmon i just bought 3800x 8 months ago
You dropped this 👑
My respect to AMD has grown much over the years. I do believe that Lisa Su brought this company from the grave.
Cant beat nvidia but can beat intel
I feel bad for the 4000 Series. They tried so hard
R3=İ5 R5=İ7 R7=İ9 R9=İ11
Congratulations to the AMD team for bringing innovation and performance to the table! Best RAYTRACED stage too😄😆. Thank you for making gamers and consumers a great product!
Wt about R3 line up
You finally get the single core, and gaming lead and your make it more expensive than Intel.  Thats Greed, and I have a Ryzen CPU.  But if you want to win back market share.  You got to be better, and cheaper.  Get rid of the 50$ price increase across the board.
Well atleast XBOX and PS fans can agree On one thing...They have the same Processor 👍
I am crying just because I am looking at this handsome asian dude who destroyed Intel.
I absolutely believe in this lady,  her shoes won me over
It must feel great to be on stage when the success basically writes the presentation. The change in confidence from the Zen "1" presentation is not lost on me. I'm so happy for AMD that a bold bet on a major architecture change is paying off like this. This is hard to achieve in the modern day in a *post* mobile CPU world and where Moore's Law has been shaky, and there have been failures even when the road ahead was straighter, which could have ended AMD given their state before Zen.
When intel will come to 5nm AMD Will be WTF Intel
I should buy an AMD gaming laptop.  The Biggest mistake I've ever have
still waiting for the 128 core threadripper AMD, and please get that 5ghz already :D
Does it replaces i9 10 th gen
I love the smell of fresh technological competition in the morning!
Why do all these CEO’s all have dr attached to their name their about as qualified as bill the psycho gates
A esto se le llama una competencia honesta y con trabajo arduo(muy diferente a la otra marca)Feliz y contento por AMD ofreciendo mucho, por menos precio.

If it weren't for Lisa Su, I wouldn't be surprised if AMD would end up getting bankrupt.
Ryzen has risen !
Intel: Fossil lake . Anyone interested? It's still 14nm+++++ tho
I got ghosebumbs at the beginning
You keep saying 1080p but who games on 1080p in 2020?
i Love Intel
AMD hitting hard, I love it
Wow  ^^
Just a beast ! Love Team Red ♥
Bought my 3950x as soon as it was available to consumers (y'know, on the market not sold out), which ended up getting to me in January. It's not even a year old and already deprecated, ESPECIALLY in gaming, which is my main focus. I both hate and love AMD right now.
I want AMD to end Nvidias monopoly ASAP
Me dreaming ryzen with an i3 6098P.
amd: announces future Zen 4 will have 5nm meanwhile Intel: So, should we start using 10nm?
2005: what is AMD?  2020: what is this Intel?
why ps5 is only zen2?
I like how they use the nick name
Zen 3 is 26% better on gaming than Zen 2. Also its the first processor to beat 600 score on Cinebench. Me, watching it on a Core 2 Duo: Ｉｎｔｅｒｅｓｔｉｎｇ
I'm waiting until next year for Gen4.
watching the  ryzen 9 xxx  in my athlon 200ge.  k fine.
you know it's bad for intel when the only competition to AMD is.... AMD itself
All the dislikes are from the people who have a intel mobo
in india the price will be high can amd do some thing in it if amd see's my comment
Dr lisa : Snaps with zen 3 Intel    : I'm not feeling well...
A male version of the Apple guy that died. Dresses like him and presents like him
AMD: Exists Intel: Why do i hear boss music
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I expected more of this. The price of Zen 3 is higher than the Zen 2 CPUs when there was no price change when Zen 2 came out. Also there aren’t as much clock speed increases. But if AMD does promise the performance rise in gaming and single core then I’m fine with the price rise.
oh I love Lisa Su I cant wait for the new cpu's and the new big navi.  pls take my moneh
Engineer Asian moms save the day. 😘
The fact big navi is showing promising fps in 4K is a good sign. I think Big navi flagship might just be competing directly with RTX 3080. If it doesnt have any supply issue and is cheaper by 10% - 20%, that will be my next upgrade.
Intel : This is not fair.  AMD: This is the way.
all intel fan boys be gone thot's......... liza su slapp the cores and threads out of you.
ddr5 ?
Intel : I'm MAD! AMD : Don't get mad, get AMD.
Minecraft RTX Released  Minecraft Radeon When wll it Release?
Dr. Lisa Su kinda looks like my science teacher.
i just got a r5 3600 today feels bad man
Intel’s the only one disliking lol

very nice work amd love very much
Amd soloing nvidia and intel
what would happen if Lisa and Papermaster made babies...would we have a new hybrid cpu?
I know performance is great, I'm okay with all price but 5800x. Too expensive on the table, $150 more than 5600x and $100 less than 5900x, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Please consider dropping the price as right now cost per core is too high for 5800x.
I love amd. But I have no pc for gaming😭😭
Eh TBH, AMD market cap is below 100Bill, and yet their launch presentation is, dare I say as exciting and beautiful than other 300+Bill corps like Samsung, NVIDIA, Huawei, and may on par in the like of Apple and Microsoft which is beyond 1,5Trillion market cap companies.... Good sign! Time to pump more stock hahahah
When they show 17:30, i saw a minus %% gain which is good for marketing because they seem pretty honest about the result to advertise their product unlike Intel
Awesome AMD! now it's Intel time to innovate and keep the war going! all fanboy rejoice for more cheaper and powerful processor!
13:47   Imagine she did a Linus and dropped it. Lol
Intel: We can't beat AMD. AMD: Fine, I'll do it myself.
Intel Zits vs AMD Zens
IN YOUR FACE, INTEL!
If you fast forward you'll hear percentage or numbers. Enjoy.
Previously, youngsters wanted to be Steve, Elon, Bill, Larry, Jeff, etc. But now they wanna be Lisa. Change of time guys. Bringing dead to life is not a joke and Lisa was the only one who could do it. SHE DID IT.
Seriously, you took Intel's best shot and wrecked it ....with your second best processor 😂😂😂 humiliation 101
Amd I am sorry I doubted you
AMD is the best under Lisa Su Leadership
Rip intel
$300 for a six-core? Damn. Do I have to wait for Intel to deliver the -cheap- affordable option now?
At least I trust your slides, unlike intel's or nvidia's.
So they deliver their promise on IPC... I’m so optimistic about RX6000 series delivering better than promised perf/watt 😁
why yall gotta do intel like that, man? im legit crying now, i cant wait to upgrade my 2600 <3
I'm  waiting
Is worth the upgrade or should I wait for zen4.
No reason to swap i9 9900k for any of this
stay in the blue people...
When you see AMD shows that their CPUs have some games that are worse than the i9 10900k, you'd know that they are honest
WAKE UP!!! The 65W 6-core processor has a price increase of $100. The 5600X is the successor of the 3600 both at 65W, the 3600X is 95W! You will not see a cheaper 6-core, because any lower clocked 6-core could be easily overclocked to the 5600X level with the current mature quality of the 7nm process.  AMD is F**KING their budget users with a 50% price increase for a 19% performance gain.  For the richer users the higher level R9 models do have a price increase (<10%), that is justified by the performance gain (19%). That part is a GOOD job!!  For the R5, the marketing must have been deep asleep or plain stupid assuming their poorer fans are idiots.  I was waiting for the Ryzen 5 4600G as successor for my 2200G, but the Ryzen 4000G clearly has been a PAPER LAUNCH for us, the poor DIY commons.  I wait till mid 2021 and then I probably buy the 3600 on ebay and re-install my 2011 NVIDIA card, that I used till 2019 with my Phenom II X4 B97. I will use that Ryzen desktop with Ubuntu for another 8 years, like I did with my Oct 2008 HP dc5850 with the Phenom, the PC  I replaced in Apr 2019 :) :)
AMD! Yes
As long as the performance increases can justify the price increase, im fine with it
I want rx 5300 realese today for budget new gpu
yummie
is their rtx for the new 6000 series gpu?
what gpu is he using 15:00
Remember, Remember The 5th Of November! I can't wait!
Rip intel
WOW!!!
Where gaming begins... pubg (not)
Very smart marketing first show 3 processors with prices then lastly 5950x with little.gain  Now people.will buy thay 549 dollar one lols
the dislike must be people who uses intel core. smh
Rip intel
Who just AMD yes after watching videos?
im weak ps5 and xbox zen 2 and zen 3 comes out lmfao
Made in chinaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
AMD = GOD of cpu intel = RIP
but only 7nm :(... my new iphone will have 5nm transistors
i am in love with lisa
Intel be like = why are we still here?? Just to suffer🤣🤣🤣
now , is u remove stock cooler with zen 3 ,pls reply
But the Prices are Bit High.. pls don't turn into Intel now.. or someone else will come and murder you too.. keep the prices Reasonable for what u are known.. if u Exploit/Abuse Monopoly now.. you will too be in the Graveyard alongside Intel..  I have been a Fan of Amd for a Long Time now.. these Zen-3 are Awesome.. but Prices are becoming Higher now.. No One would Like that.. and it will Open Doors for New Players to turn into Amd as Amd turns into Intel.
AMD fastest 2010 desktop CPU price: $265 (Phenom 1100T)  AMD fastest 2020 desktop CPU price: $549 - $799 (Ryzen 59X0X)  Draw your own conclusions.
the next step is taking over the videocard game, thats a monumental task but they got momentum
Taiwanese, video card battle
this thing is a beast
im sorry ive always liked intel and i stick with it because of my loyalty for them for 15 years and their solid product in the past years but amd is the way to go now....if youre doing an upgrade theres really no reason to not go with amd at this point for your cpu.
Now I regret buying the Ryzen 9 3900XT...
go AMD GO GO
It sounds all very promising but i also think we need to see the real life results first Before hyping it to heaven. For example nvidia also talked highly about the new Graphics card which are better yes but not by the amount they showed in their presentation. In short these guys know how to talk.
They added boss music at the end???
Only amd can beat amd
Those dislikes are from Intel shareholders. Ryzen definitely kicking their a$$.
mom spaghetti

Intel Coffin Lake
Love that all the pc needs got this on trending. Or YouTube rly like amd, idk
Will this be good enough for Flight Sim 2020 though?
why 5000 and no 4000
6 core 300$ what a trash, 6 core used to be 200$, AppleMD
We want waith prisim in r5 5600
That moment where AMD Said the PC Performance was STUCK TILL Ryzen came, explains 100% the Feeling of every Gamer, beeing Ripped off by Intel from 2013-2017 because there was not Alternativ! now we got it!
I am looking forward to the 5950X... and I am SO GLAD I waited! But I hope there will be some innovation in regards to the cooler design, especially after remembering how LOUD the Radeon VII was! And I also hope power efficiency and software support will be welcome. The only reason I am staying with NVIDIA at the moment is because of renderers like VRay and Octane work VERY well with RTX.
AMD: Join us and just say "AMD  Yes!" with me, and then you can become the part of the AMD.

Nice
Intel will come back folks strongly!
Please make ryzen processor price less than 50 dollar for ryzen 5 3950x
intel bye  RIP INTEL
So great! Thanks AMD!
you have to like Lisa Su 🧡💛💚💙💜🤎
Amazing presentation
-intel
AMD: "Hey can I copy your homework?" Nvidia: "Sure but don't make it obvious."
AMD YES!!!!
I have a 3900X so I'll likely sit this generation out but... you're really making it hard AMD.
intel RIP
Red killed Blue.
If we’re talking about woman w power “Lisa su” should be the candidate and feminist should look up on her cuz I respect her!
YEAH GAMING!!!!
Leave the likes at 59K for the Ryzen 5900X   !  and like my comment 59 times to celebrate!

I'm so excited already started saving thank god I have a good job :) Thank you AMD for giving a very good CPU priced correctly for my next big rig upgrade
When I will build my first custom pc 2-3 years from now, I will side with AMD. So will be my next laptop
Intel: fossil lake
So invest in amd?
still using a ryzen 3 2200G and still beating a i7 lmao
Y'll exited to amd new gen cpu's and Gpu's Meanwhile : Me trying to play CS:GO on Intel HD Graphics 4000 XD.
I am intel and I find this humiliating 😭
did she wore jean with heels?
Cant wait for the next gen console again (after PS5 and XBox Series X), the performance will be beast.
Dislikers are Intel users
Going to the police station right now Reporting how Lisa Su murders an entire Blue Corporation due to their incompetence....
Ryzen price gap of 3700x and 5700x is 120$ Its costly but if they increase the price by 50 or 75$ its good for bugdet gamer's
Very happy with my Ryzen 5 1600 ❤
AMD : let's increase clock speed and ipc and improve cache latency Intel : let's sponsor Linus!
This was a hardcore snuff film...and Intel was the victim.
I observe cpu buyers last decade mostly people buy amd are professionals. Mean while ppl buys intel those who earn minimum wages lmaooo broke ass intel fanboiss
Pog Pog PogU
No one is talking about zen?
Man, lisa su is super hot *wink*
R.I.P intel

Wow, a WOMAN knows how to build a gaming cpu and gpu better than a man. Lisa you got my respect for all ya life❤🙌
fan boy amd with  love
Man I love her, and although she's a confident presenter, she's still so awkward haha; her cousin Jensen definitely has that on her. But she'll give him a whooping come 3 weeks too🤠🏍🏎go team Red!
She has two watches on...
When Nvidia launched rtx 3000 series claiming 2x up boost everyone be like: "Wait for the reviewer's benchmark cause that might be over saturated." and that was actually true. They did lie at some sense. But this AMD release I won’t bother because after that -3 chart you know everything they say is true.
me getting exicited cause a new amd cpu released:yeee boi    my potato laptop with an i3 knowing dam well taht my parents arent gonna buy it:
I wonder if this will sell out asap like rtx 3xxx
You: Comments as a question Me: Seriously, WTF's with the question format in comments. Just write it as a sentence ffs!!
"..consistent delivery to the market, as promised."  Oh burn! Side eyeing Intel 10nm.
we willl killllll intel
hilarious how AMD fans for the last year have been preaching paying extra cash for only 2% fps wasnt worth it. Now AMD officially comes out with a product they says adds and additional 28%more fps vs zen2 in games yet is only -3-5% faster than comet lake? So according to AMD they finally caught up with 14nm+++++++  in gaming?  Rocketlake FTW?
How amd is giving great processor in very low price

Why is L3 cache important? It's only 32MB so I can't imagine it's storing and fetching for anything significant?
I can't wait to get my hands on a 5600X!!!! Thanks AMD!!!
Все хорошо, кроме цен на процессор.
24:17 “10.28”, that’s the same number of teraflops the PS5 has. Is this an easter egg?
3700X......
I left AMD after the FX series and went with an i7 7700K, my first and probably last Intel CPU. Welcome back AMD. :-)
Sweet!
Ohhh boy, the 5900X would be such a great match with my new RTX 2070 Super
Y'all need to focus on your graphics card make that better AMD G-Force is kicking your ass and the graphics card League very disappointing?
Zen 3 surpasses my expectations but Radeon 6000 series looks to be a bit of a let down.

12:58 wow that guy would make a good politician, the way he says all that bs. The bottom line will be the game benchmarks. I'm due for an upgrade and happy to be considering AMD for my next CPU/GPU.
Thank you AMD for making it possible to access great quality at reasonable prices. ❤️❤️
intel ded
Wow, love AMD(my first PC),  bullied, restarted from scratch, now the top dog, please do not ever practice unfair market practices and do not tarnish your reputation even if you will be beaten,  and also please keep listening to consumers, im more excited about next year's 5nm, i think it would be an exclamation point to end the competition.....
Nice,r5 5600x for 300bucks,in Kazakhstan it will be 400$...i will better buy r7 2700 for 180$
It's Not Real ..we all died 6 months ago & last Cruel Joke of 2020
Good Job AMD, now there will be a million people outside the Micro Center at November 5
ok
you need Si in your chips , Su need C on her ring
With the money AMD made with the ps4 and Xbox one series making the CPU and GPU of the consoles, now finally they can fight Intel in every new CPU processor series for computers.
*Intel* joined the chat 😏😏😏
Makes sense 799 for the 5950x
Intel: *why do I hear boss music?!*
Please decrease the price of processer to usd price in India please please
Can i have one

just bought a ryzen 5 3600..... :(
Intel's german engineer Like 😭😭😭 9999999999
The price is so high,maybe i will change to buy intel
Poor intel...
can we get an F in the chat for Intel
This looks so amazing! I can't wait to upgrade my PC!  *Looks in Wallet*   oh...
wait why does the man look like Jeff Bezos
Eiii Intel where just big cheats ! They  priced i9 9900KS at 513 dollars an 8 core / 16Thread processor . Intel just kept releasing i7 4 core / 8Thread processors for 7 years . Ryzen first gen forced them to create a more expensive SKU called i9 and i9X . With little to no architectural redesign . They have been just on 14NM since 2015 . To me it's just stupid to be on a 7th, 8th and 9th gen platform and trying to upgrade to 10th gen . 10th gen can't even beat Zen 2 convincingly . I still can't believe people are at still gaming at 1080p . 1080p performance is important for budget gamers I get it , but most people will buy 5900X and above will not pair it with a weak GPU like 1660 super .   To anyone who trying to build a budget  gaming PC today just wait for a Ryzen 5600X or buy 3600XT, 3800XT processors . You can also go for the normal 3600X , 3700X or 3800X.
Sweet. Congrats AMD. I will stay on my 2950X, but damn the performance is nice. Will probably upgrade when the Zen 4 is out (hopefully with DDR5 support).
Dr. Lisa Su for President 2024
Prices are reasonable, I was expecting a bit lower prices. But the 5950X is a very good pricing. The rest is very competitive, and it looks will give AMD a really healthy profit too. Finally AMD sets the game.
press f to pay respect to intel RIP INTEL
no fortnite? LOLs.
ㅎㅎ
She has transformed AMD. Amazing leader. Love Ryzen.
Tfw you realize they are talking at a wall
I've had my Ryzen 9 3900X for a few months now. Absolutely rock solid and ridiculous performance for what I paid.
Got Disappointed by the price
I just bought a 9700k rip
intel crying 😂
I'd really love to know how these do in minecraft with some serious shader mods lol
Finally good news in 2020
Alternate title: More expensive desktop processors that you can't afford
AMD gave us everything in this video but captions so I can watch it in online class
AMD is for gamers!  Intel: Hold my b... wait whaat?!
As AMD challenges the plateauing Intel and getting there, somebody should challenge Microsoft. These companies are stagnant in their comfort zone, no significant innovations for the masses and painfully degrading the the pace of computer evolution. Time for the "underdogs" who are more in touch with the community to take over with more enthusiasm with reasonably priced products. Hope AMD's success will not get over their heads..
amd is lol for this new price
Camera turns to crowd  Crowd:💀
Yes, finally a Radeon driver for DQHD monitors.
Maintaining a quality pc is hella expensive lol and they say they are the master race. Do yourself a favor and just get a console
AMD 👍👍👍
The king is dead (Intel), long live the King (AMD)!

Nice.

AMD AND GAMING SHOULDNT BE IN THE SAME SENTENCE LMFAO
Jesus is coming soon Christian ! Get ready to go home!!
This is amazinggggg!!!!
Cool name
I don't know why I'm getting goosebumps for a tiny processor
STOP AMD! THEY'RE (INTEL) ALREADY DEAD 💀💀💀
AMD: Uses real games and relevant benchmarks to show how much their chips have improved.  Intel: We don't do that here.
Ey ey, the glossy floor doesn't look 'that' good for this presentation cuz of the big screen.. tho is this a clue about Ray Tracing?!?! HEHEHEH I'm EXCITED
can't wait for the benchmarks of nvidia and amd, then i'm going to decide which GPU i'm going to buy!
East or west Amd is the best
Now intel gonna release they gen 11 ? xD
OK I have a couple problems. There's no ryzen 3 for us budget gamers an theres not non x ryzen 5. Also can I have a budget gamers discount
5900x has better single core than my intel has multi
cant buy it if its too pricey tho
Lisa stop, stop Intel is already dead.
22:30 chonkers
Lisa Su is a real leader , if I had such a inspirational boss I’d try my best to give my all for the company
Intel: fails to do yoga and gets an f in multi core performance but leads in gaming and single core performance      And 5000s series: Ima bout end this man's whole career
If it wasn't for amd i couldn't afford a pc
I can sense a curb your meme vid coming up I can feel it
Lisa Su is pretty cool. Thank you AMD engineers.
698 Intel engineers disliked this video.
Bummer! I can't afford these!!😭 was seriously considering to shift to AMD but😒ufffff. O well i5 9400f it is then😑.
She's like the female version of Jensen Huang lol
As an Intel user for the past decade, it's time I admit, AMD is now miles ahead of Intel in gaming performance.
AMD YES
I am so excited fot the Big Navi, people that bought the competition will regret not waiting a little bit longer. Thank you, AMD, you are doing wonders to the gaming industry
I already have a 3900X and need the money for the 6000 series Radeon GPU. Will have to skip Zen 3 sadly.
Now Intel can print on their boxes: Best CPU for battlefield V xD
24:16. The beat of the drum is awesome... The title should be "the death of letni". Love it...
Papermaster mentioned leadership in "x86 market" more than once. Maybe AMD will release ARM competitor in the future?
YEAH!!
Today AMD made history. Again.
TE AMO LISA SUUUUU <3
AMD pliss release amd Radeon 6000 series rtx alone has released their 3000 series
i find it hard to understamd how amd can make such developments im cpus and intel cannot? when intel is so massive u would think they would do everything not to let this happen. seems rigged, thats all
Just hype, and more hype, and copying the MO that Steve Jobs started about 20 years ago ...
Hmm... looks appealing. I'll wait for the receipts from benchmarks. I may leave intel after all these years. Heck, I may leave nvidia too, we'll see.
Intels press conference:  Yeah we got nothing , thanks for coming folks , see you next year.
We love AMD.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I want to see what they can do at 4k and 1440p
Will these finally support DRM instruction sets so I can finally use an UHD Bluray player??
That presentation really looks weird, they talking to a ghost audience like that. Why couldn't they look at the camera?  Other than that, really impressive stuff.
When u drop 530$ on a 10900k and this happens
@AMD Zen4 with 5nm, is it possible to give inbuild gpu that can handle Triple-A games at least @1080p 144Hz?
Literally 99% won’t see this but if you do, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day read my name 🙏
Literally 99% won’t see this but if you do, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day read my name 🙏
Well i don't see any reason to upgrade my current ryzen 3700x with only 88w of power consumption and incredible amount of performance anyways. But i am curious to see what the 5nm zen4 will look like if they can improve performance this much with the same process node.
So big navi is on par with 2080 Ti acording to borderlands 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Gears of War 5 benchmarks. That equals rtx 3070
AMD: what is 14nm？ Intel:the thing I am still working on it😭
happy birthday lisa su.
Mark paper master. Nice name lol.
Hi good job AMD, can you tell when's DDR5 launching? I stuck in a mess where I had DDR3 RAM and modern mother boards were DDR4 so it was frustrating for me.
Intel: " AMD Yes!"
I hope Ryzen 5000 also a lot increase in price / performance vs Ryzen 3000 :) Waiting for review to see it.
Rest in Heat Intel.
True winners perform the best consistently even without top hardware (but this helps).
Why is nobody talking about how immaculate Lisa Su is?
amd should have gone easier with the price on chips with less than 8 cores
What can I say apart  GAME ON
Remember remember the Fifth of November.
Well done AMD. Watch the quality control and keep going 💪
With Zen 3 finally for the first time AMD beats Intel in gaming.
💖💝💝💝If you are reading this comment:  BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000!!!   💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💝💝💝💝💝💝💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💞💞
Great work Lisa & AMD! hoping big Navi would bring some surprise Oct. 28th as well! BTW: feeling Lisa is not super comfortable in high heels :-)
Ryzen is good, but they’ll never beat intel.
I am genuinely curious when AMD adapts MBCFET (~ at 3/2nm)
Definitely going to switch to AMD for my next pc. Where I live, AMD is a better buy, even if it's not necessarily cheaper.
Thank you very much for doing such a good job guys and you made tech affordable for us. It seems you are going to lead the game soon.
Lol, very underwhelming. My expectations weren't even high to begin with.
Remember remember the 5th of november
Mark this day because this is the first time AMD beat Intel in single-core performance.  Considering Intel is bumbling with their 7nm process.  AMD will most likely keep this lead for a long time.
We want a gpu best than nvidia 3090
Jim Keller, Lisa Su, AMD engineers  Bravo!
Grate job! And it's still will run on my mb with AM4 from 2017... Fantastic! Just will replace my 1700x with 5600x and update bios. Thank you AMD Intel runs new CPU socket every generation and you need to buy new mobo every year
Its just a computer..
Gaming starts with AMD 'G' am I a joke to you
Lisa Su saved AMD.
rip Intel
I wish they would have benched Doom Eternal. That game loves AMD cpus & threads. I guess we'll see it when tech channels get their hands on the 5900x & 5950x, especially when combined with a 3080 or 3090.  Also.. why did they only bench 1080p? Still looking forward to this cpu!
10:02 I don't know why but I love that paricular slide in the background so much
amd yes!!!!! Now who is the best gaming CPU ?
Rip intel
Mark: “I couldn’t be more excited to share a little bit more about Zen 3”  *Says it in the most mono-tonal voice I’ve ever heard*
AMD  :"you can't beat me" Intel  :  "I know, but he can!"  *new AMD processor show up*
his surname is actually papermaster. what a legend.
Just for fun I'm going to run Cinebench 1T on my intel 2600K. I'll post the completed score here some time in the next week.
*3900XT.
LISA IS LOVE. LISA IS LIFE.
AMD killed the end boss Intel.
This is going to be the best CPU upgrade I've ever had available.
Huge rocks on neck and fingers, you don't want to mess with this one.
I didn't like the edition, I would have liked to see all taken in one shot... otherwise nice hardware
Which CPU you will choose? My answ is AMD. You can write it down bellow.
5698 Grove Street South, St. Petersburg, FL
from dual core duo  to A6 5400k to ryzen 5 2600 ♥♥♥
AMD! YES!
Lisa Su, the female Steve Jobs😉😁😆
The ONLY problem I have with this video is that useless POS "game" league of legends.
"... our goal simply, outright leadership." Yep.
I am now a converted AMD
AMD: Look Mark Papermaster *points* Intel: *looks* AMD: *steals performance crown* Where Are You? AMD: La Candela *Floats off doing twinkle toes*
"at 1080p" is the key word
can i have a 5950x for testing purposes for an extended period of time ? i will send you a pair of clogs as a gift from my country and youtube channel. (they are talking to an empty room :-) )
Pricing at 19:36 😱
Literally 99% won’t see this but bless you and stay safe I’m struggling to hit 2k with noti🔔
is it better to keep 3800XT or get a AMD Ryzen™ 7 5800X when it out? seem to have same cores count.
AMD Engineers: That was great guys, let's get started on the 5nm CPU. Meanwhile Intel engineers:  How the hell did they get the 7nm processor to work??
The 5800X is too expensive (price given without taxes ..), and no 5700X presented. Pity... Price it's not logic... 5600x 299$ (6 cores)...5800X 449$ ( JUSTE +2 cores BUT more 149$ ??? )... and 5900X 549$.. (+4 cores ! and juste 100$...)
LISA SU IS DA MAN!!!!!
1:30 thats a geforce gpu
This is everything I hoped for.
Well i think is just BIG!!!
Lisa killed that global presentation! AMD is going to take over the world! Cannot wait to get my hands on the new Ryzen 9 5900x.
Robert Hallock : Hey everyone Bully Macquire : HAH?
Camera work was terrible OMG
Lisa Su is the saviour of AMD. Just a few bummer about this series. No stock cooler and price to performance isnt as impressive with the ryzen 3000 with that notable price increase. But this is still better than Intel offerings lol
Incredible camera work, swift and without claping. I wish more of these in future.
*Like: AMD*  *Comment: Intel*
"it's about making the right bets 3 to 5 years in advance...and bringing them to fruition" Love that line.  I'm sold on Ryzen!  Thanks AMD for bringing awesome competition! Lisa Su = Best thing ever for AMD!  This woman pulled together a great team.  Great job!!!
Amd got demonitized for saying covid
Kicking intel while they’re down
7:00 Mark looks like a mix of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates
I am so pumped for this, how is AMD stock not through the roof?
Ill take ur entire stock
Zen 2: you can run 4 chrome tabs at once  Zen 3: you can run 6 chrome tabs at once 🤯 I know guys you thought you’d never see the day
Any news on upcoming mobile APU ?
One thing people aren't talking about is that the lower latencies (probably) afforded by the unified cache means that audio workloads (also dependent on high IPC, like gaming) should get a performance improvement. Most people think audio workloads are trivial, but they can be pretty demanding if you're writing a film score with a full (virtual) orchestra, or cramming a synthesized instrument through a long FX chain (each effect in an FX chain has to wait on the previous effect to be done processing, so these can't be parallelized, making IPC super relevant here)
AMD must stand as one
Hopefully they'll crush NVidia in the DeepLearning segment in the coming years.
. . . And it's been soooo much fun to have this time with you as well. It's like we are bosom buddies.
from intel to amd person = me
Meh
I had Pentium 4 1,4 GHz, Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600, and now i have Intel Core i7-4790K. And in the near future I plan to buy an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X. No regrets.
I want Ryzen 9 5900X to get 5.0 GHz or more, please it has 7nm+, it will not overheat.
me: looks at my 10700k 10700k: sweating profusely
Innovation. Is it not beautiful to behold.
This series of CPUs will be Out of Stock for a solid 2 months, at the very least.
Welp seems to me no Nvidia car for me lol. I definitely will built a new system an all AMD RIG!
And it will be a quarter the price of the intel eventual competitor processor.
i fee like im in a mw2 lobby
Intel has left the chat...
AMD CPUs? Yes please......AMD GPUs? That's a big no. I've had too many bad experiences and headaches with their GPUs in the past, from failing parts to major driver issues. No trust left
Sick! After 16 years I think I'm going back to the red team's CPUs
苏妈，我刚换过pc了，之前的坏了，本来想等，可是不买又不行
Couldn't help but laugh when i found out all those gaming benchmarks have been done with nvidia graphics cards.. hahaha
my A9 Radeon laptop is a potato, it can't run any of my fav. games past the Genesis Sonic titles
single core 631  score? Its amazing
Wow AMD. Just leave Intel alone. They already hurt a lot.
Bih
You can make all the hardware in the world but when WIndows 10 Updates brick hardware through windows update, then there isn't much point in buying anything new.  Windows 10 updates drivers for things that do not even exist on the hardware at times.  You guys can make a great hardware, but without Software to back it up, it is pointless.  Linux can't do everything. Windows 10 is the worst thing to happen in the tech industry since Windows ME.  We should have had a REAL OS by now but they do not want to give you a real OS.  The last real OS they put out was 8.1 and I would go back to it gladly if you guys would support it and put drivers out.  Until then, there is no point in ever buying hardware again if its only going to be bricked by windows 10.  I have not had a working windows machine in over 2 years because of windows 10 and your support for only it. You are just as guilty for not supporting the previous OS like you initially said you would.  Shame on you AMD for bowing down to Microsoft and Windows 10.
"gaming starts with AMD" It's true, Ryzen 2400G is my first PC processor and it will remain close to my heart
Looks like Rocket Lake is going to need to be incredible to stop AMD dominating the next 12 months
The good news: I actually have the money right now just laying around for the first time in my life to buy a 5800X and a 3070 to go with it with nothing else to spend it on. Excellent timing!
i think ill buy the radeon
AMD have overall delivered on promises. AMD vs AMD.
Lisa: Ryzen 5600X $299 Me: cries in Canadian currency while extending his arm towards the monitor in desperation 🤏😫
what if i buy zen 3 and x570 motherboard and do not have a zen 2 cpu how can i update the bios on the motherboard so my cpu supports it
She's like an Italian mafia boss with all that bling.
How about threadripper?
*RYZEN 5900X MULTI CORE CB R20 : 8146*  @AMD PS: Next time pixel multicore ratio aswell 😜
Thank you AMD, for all mankind !
I like to read comments of those whom never buy intel and thinks amd is faster just because he has no money for intel...
Think about next year... Ryzen 9 *69* 50x
I want lower prices for Ryzen 5000 CPUs.
Bought a brand new pc with AMD 9 and Nvidia 2070 3 months ago. I got screwed twice lol
JAY-Z is God in the book of Revelation. I know this because I have the name “Jesus” on my thigh. Apocalypse/Revelation 19:16 says on His robe and thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS. Donald Trump is a beast in Apocalypse
AMD: we're gonna show consoles in alphabetical order XBox: ...
"Kick them when they are down" Just to be sure. AMD - No, STOMP them when they are down just to be sure!  I'm sold, old Intel Haswell 5960X to new AMD Zen3 5950X will be a nice jump for me.   ;)
Intel: god damn it, someone get me the chip designer of Ryzen chip, I need him/her to work for me
DAM AMD MAD
I just bought 3700X yesterday not too happy right now
!AMD YES!
Thanks Lisa, that was fantastic!
Poor intel they just wanted to gain money and amd just said "Oh so you want to make money? What's that? You said yes? Too bad!"
AMD fans: oh cool Intel fans: oh no they raised the price one time during a pandemic its ganna continue.....!
Intel 11900k - hold my beer
I'm guessing all the dislikes are from people who bought a processor in the last few months.... or Fan Bois of the dethroned competion :P
**Intel injured and  limping during the fight**  **Fans lean in on AMD's ear and whisper** : Sweep the leg  AMD: It shall be done my lords
Intel has left the chat.
Rip intel
The dislike are from intel fanboy and their employees
You get the last generation of CPU and GPU to get... 60 fps? 17:31 Battlefield V players get scam lol
Feels like I'm the only female who loves games
I just bought a ryzen 5 3600, I’m so pissed
are my b450 tomahawk max support ryzen 5000 series?
If those big navi numbers are real, it should be only slightly slower than the 3080, wonder what the pricing is going to look like :P
"Skylake friends, it's safe to upgrade now" - Lisa Su 08.10.2020
Is it ATX AM4
Now I just hope intel can keep up and offer a huge boost in performance in their next gen of cpus. Because don’t get it wrong that AMD just like intel; want max long term profits above customer satisfaction. We need competition from both competitors. We also need more competitors but I don’t know if that’ll ever happen.
17:16 You know, I'd be more impressed if the games list didn't feature games that can run on toasters (LoL & CS:GO). Was the license for Doom Eternal too much?
Works with x370?
bet Sony bought their place to be first in the lineup
Can’t wait for that new Ryzen 7 5800x!
Intel is definitely in big ASS trouble!
Good to see cocky Intel get disrupted.
RIP Intel
AMD SLAYING DEMONS  NVIDIA AND INTEL WOW
waiting for 5100x and 5300x.
IS NO BODY GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW THE 4K MW PERFORMANCE IS ABOUT 15% Better than RTX 3090 MW 4k performance?!?!?!?
I love my i9-10900k buy dayuuuum AMD got me thinking lol................Thumbs up AMD!
AMD: *pulls out a blade from the flames*  Intel:  No... no!!!
wow
AMD master race!
This makes me very hyped and gives me more hope for Big Navi
18:10 "We know you're gonna wait for benchmarks, but..."  It's rude to poke a corpse, Mr. Hallock.
Are we sure amd doesn't have some Irish blood?? They were down getting gutter stomped and than slowly but violently got back up and started throwing hands back!
Look at that~ A woman CEO. If other  women were to take science courses instead of gender studies, they'd probably be CEOs by now too. Just goes to show how completely worthless gender studies truly is. Instead of learning how to improve their life, they only learned how to colour their hair pink.
As a 3600 proud owner and not a fanboy of anything, these increase in price let me down, these is why competition it´s good!
17:19 Intel be like: So no ones gonna talk about the -3% on battlefield??
R.I.P INTEL
"#5 on trending" Oh yeah, there will _definitely_ be plenty of stock.
Is the AMD device competing with Nvidia? Or are they two separate components? Someone who knows tech please help!
Really awesome CPU's. But if you look at 24:29 it shows you how much confidence AMD currently has in their current GPU lineup :D. They used a nvidia 2080ti to benchmark. To be fair it is better this way.
I have a r5 1600AF and I already play everything as I like, I cant even imagine those processors, well done AMD
These guys have turned into winners, i like it.
Ryzen 5000 series = total beasthood!  I'm not so sure about RX6000 series GPUs, we'll see.......!
good job for the marketing ! oouuyeaah rich people buy that new zen3 ! and then sell the 3000 series for cheap ! i wanna get the 3600 for 100eur so that will be still "the budget gaming god cpu"
I love how very connected with the consumers this presentation was. No talks of "magic" and corporate BS, but real numbers we all understand and want to see. If AMD hadn't made a revolution in the computing field with Zen2, Intel would keep selling us same 4 core 8 thread CPU for another 10 years.
Now as much as i hate intel, we need them to make sure amd dont dominate the market and took monopoly. Luckiky, nvidia recognised amd as a threat and reacted accordingly with rtx 3000 series, intel? Lmao they be dozing off in the distance
Needs more kitchen.
I can remember my 4 Mhz Z80 computer with 32K of ram from the early '80s. I thought it was fast.
Nice but i'm keeping my 9900k
"we want to disrupt the PC market" Nevermind Zen 3. I think they totally did that when they launched AMD Bike lol 🚲
I love Ryzen, but in Russia the prices are terrible, Ryzen 3700x in translation from rubles to dollars costs now $370, 5600x will cost about the same, and this is the junior processor at the moment :c with I still sit on 2700x :c we need regional prices =\
I9-10900K Has left the chat
rip intel
Well, I guess that there's no question as to what card ATi aimed at when they made Big Navi and it was the RTX 3080.  It looks like they hit their target and all of the naysayers who were saying "a little bit above the 2080 Ti" are now eating several plates full of crow.
anyone wait for new intel 14nm+++++++++++++?😂
Gg
Another amazing product! Can't wait for Big Navi too! Thanks AMD for making it feel like Christmas already 🤩😄❤️
I just got a 3950X come on!
INTEL is going to Drop Prices .  time to get i9-10900k on cheap.
Bye bye intel 🤣❤️
Too expensive.
I have waited for Lisa's announcement. I never waiting any IT manufacturing announcement before.
yaaay, finally a competitive GPU from the team red !
Should be marked as 18+ as it's clearly BDSM scene involving Intel
Intel is shitting themselves right now.
I should have waited to the end of the year (my original plan) to build a gaming pc now im feeling like in idiot building 4 months ago.
normal grandma: i bakes cookies lisa su: i got you a 5ghz rx 6900 pc
Well done AMD! Have come so far. Took a lot to get me to switch from Intel, but they delivered (where Intel has only disappointed). And their GPUs are bringing the fight to NVIDIA.... Some health competition is great to see.
Welp I'm gonna need to upgrade my 4 month old ryzen 5 3600.
ngl Lisa su looks like she's presenting in front of the class when she has no idea what its about
That 5800X looks very poorly priced to me. Should be 399USD at most.
Laptop pls madam
12:34 "We're focused on execution"...  me: Executing Intel right?
why there is no ryzen 3  5400???
why am i crying?  good job amd!
What happened to N7P over 7nm? Too expensive?
Great job AMD and great leadership Lisa Su! Just in few years AMD is dominating the CPU market and is on top in the GPU market.
Love my 3900X.. but! 5000 series looks dope!
Fantastic presentation AMD!
It's high time that leading render engine companies should start optimizing their render engines to Radeon cards. Some render engines like Redshift and Arnold upright don't even support AMD cards yet. Such a shame that even though Radeon cards provide high memory amount for an affordable price can't be used for rendering purposes.
So if the 5600 comes out it'll be 250$? Don't get me wrong, zen 3 is gonna be banger for sure, but I'm not crazy about those new prices, specially if next year zen 4 is gonna be on a new socket most likely, meaning those overpriced b550 boards are gonna be crazy obsolete after just one new generation of ryzen.
Wooohooo go Lisa Su
A question of the DAY - Will the new CPU work with B450 boards???? Thank you. Paul. iTFTComputers
MAKE AMD GREAT AGAIN!
good presentation, but the 3d demostration was a joke!
Without AMD, we’d be stuck with a quad-core as the top of the line gaming CPU ffs 🤦‍♂️. Competition is hella beautiful isn’t it
Every time they talk about shipping on time Bob Swan sheds another tear.
I just hope this launch won't end up like the one from a famous GPU manufacturer, in green
They came so strong they're breaking their own records in the same presentation.
Why use 2080Ti for testing if you make your own graphics cards? and will the CPU's be actually available or is it going to be like the Nvidia paper launch? Thank you. Paul. iTFTComputers
I am totally convinced that 85% of games will see a good increase over Intel in performance. But I am upset that bumped up prices. I guess that's something they can do now that they are the leaders.
Up to 4.9GHz in a 16 core CPU? *BRUH*
AMD FTW.
If AMD had released this instead of the XT's in the spring, they definitely would have had a sale from me! At the time though, Intel was my ideal choice. Next one will be Ryzen for sure. As for GPU... Well, that has yet to be seen. I have not been a fan of Radeon cards previously... I hope they change that.
RIP Intel
"Through fire and water, from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth. Until, at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside".
BTW Intel: Vagena Lake -  Roadmap 2022
Amazing AMD! <3
I'm i7-6950x user and I love Ryzen.  Who knows, maybe I'll go AMD in 2021.
What's up with Battlefield V and the -3 %
This is great performance, but the high price bump is kind of disappointing. The cpus above the 5600x don't even include a cooler... meh
+19% IPC ✔️😎 +26% Gaming Performance ✔️😎😎           +50 dollars on MSRP ❌😭
As long as AMD is this ambitious and passionate. I will never buy Intel again.  Lisa and the AMD team have my full support.  Can't wait to change out my 6600K
I expect no competition from Intel to this launch. Even in 2021.  And when they do, Zen 4 probably will be on its way.
I would say F in the chat for intel but they don't deserve respect
Can't wait!
bye bye intel, it's time to go home xD
Is the older amd cpu price will decrease or no?
When my 6 Core 8700K at 4.8Ghz still keeps up with equal frame rate a 12 Core AMD 5900X @ 1440p. Look it up.
Интел сосед Это писец и счастье , расчёты с 72 метрами кеша - взрыв.
Woooowww...
Intel: anyway..... Want to see our new chip 14nm++++++++++++++ Brokelake?
pls run Zen3 on high tier X370 Motherboards like a Crosshair 6 Hero witch has better VRMs like the low end X570 Boards
i WANT THAT NEW GRAPHICS CARD PLEASE I CANT ORDER A 3080
Not a wise investment for TN panel but it's definitely future proof.
2020 is the year of the gamer
no spatula showcase? maybe they saving it for RDNA2
Intel: "Innovation? Progress? Who needs all that? We have been dominating the market for the entire decade. We don't have any competitors." AMD's new 7nm Zen processors: "Allow us to introduce ourselves."
great but was that 10900k at 3.7ghz or what
AMD using an Nvidia GPU for benchmarking and testing is a big move
Lisa Su la tiene re grande
Intel fanboys are smackin that dislike button right now lol
Wonder why they use 2080ti rather than new unnamed amd gpu
-3% on BFV... hmmmm
Go Team Rocket... I say, Go Team Radeon
Stop AMD, Intel is already dead
please do a better job launching than nvidia, thx
Playstation fans: "Lisa mentioned PS5 first, that must mean PS5 is RDNA3 and better than xbox series GPU's!"
I think it's time to upgrade my fx 8350...or should I wait for am5 socket?!?!
No 5700 or 5700X ???
Cost more than I was expecting... Unless you're planning on some non X versions.
I just want to have the processor for bragging rights.... hopefully my motherboard can support it! (It's a B350 chipset board)
"execute" they did)
Let’s goooooo!!!
Amd suyundan koy biraz o ne fiyat

I hope they knock it out of the ballpark with Big Navi so they can be the leaders in CPU and GPU performance. In fact I’ll make a promise to AMD: Beat the 3080 at 1080p/1440p and at least match it at 4K and I’ll forego my planned 3080 upgrade and will instead sell off my 9900K setup and build a full AMD gaming rig with Big Navi and 5900x. I’ll post the build on my channel if AMD delivers on October 28th.

Yes I can finally play league of legends with 300fps instead of 200
Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.
At this point it's pretty safe to say the next decade of PC performance belongs to Lisa.  The great mystery is whether she's driven by competition with Uncle or if they both help each other out.
You made a mistake: this should be a 4000 series, with a cpu on top the 4950, what can go up to 4.9 GHz, then the next gen the 5000 series could touch the 5.0 GHz... then resolve the naming with the 7k series... maybe with GPU and resolution Ks :)
Now I'm able to comfortably buy Ryzen 5000 for my new build thanks to the watts staying constant. Thank you AMD.
I'm watching the introduction under a minute and I'm already itching to order a 5950X.
Press F for Intel :'(

Lisa Su is rocking those heels! So excited to see what the future has for AMD
Lisa Su is a freaking prophet. The way she managed to completely turn around a company on the brink of death is just amazing. And now look at where AMD is, completely annihilating any and all competition in the CPU landscape.
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Sin according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Everyone has turned to their own ways trying to determine for themselves what is right and wrong. Humanity are lovers of sin rather than lovers of God. As a result, God has given us over to a depraved mind that lust after shameful things. Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins; with diseases/sickness, natural disasters, riots, racism, etc. All manner of evil plagues the world because we sinned against God. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. So Death is an arresting officer that brings you into the courtroom of God. "The soul that sins shall die" "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the Death sentence. The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth'' (Matthew 13:42)  Do you think you're Good enough to enter heaven safely when you die? Here's how you can be sure:  A Test: based on the 10 commandments 1. Thou shall have no other gods before me. 2. Thou shall have no idol. 3. Thou shall not take God's name in vain. 4. Thou shall honor the day of Sabbath. 5. Honor thou mother and father.6. Thou shall not murder. 7. Thou shall not commit adultery. 8. Thou shall not steal.9. Thou shall not lie. 10. Thou shall not covet.  - Have you ever lied in your life?• Jesus said whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery in the heart,- Have you ever looked at anyone with lust?‐ Have you used God's name as a curse word?- Have you ever stolen anything big or small?- Have you ever Hated someone?• Jesus considers it as murder in the bible.  If you said yes to just one of them then you're already guilty in God's eyes " for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just  one point is guilty of breaking all of it. " (James 2:10) Therefore, God says " neither liars, nor blasphemers, nor adulterers, nor thieves nor murderers will inherit the kingdom of God". You have to face God on judgement day with all of your sin, even the secret ones."The soul that sins shall die "(Ezekiel 18:4) and they are destined for Hell  Don't rely on your own Goodness or Good works to save you. Do not be deceived neither you, your friends, family, a priest, a pastor, religion, nor attending a church can save you. That's like bribing God to let you into heaven. "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," (Romans 3:23)"But we are all like an unclean thing, and all of our righteousness are like filthy rags; we fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like wind have taken us away." (Isaiah 64:6) "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; Who can know it? (Jeremiah 17:9)  God's definition of "Good" is morally excellent and none of us can match his goodness. "No one is good except God alone." (Luke 18:19) Because he is a Good God, he's a lover of righteousness and justice, he must punish all who sin. God cannot simply forgive you alone for your sins because his wrath against all sinners must be satisfied. But God takes no pleasure in sending anyone to hell, God wants to forgive you for your sins.  Do you know what he did for guilty sinners?  2000 years ago, God became a human being, "God was manifested in the flesh"( Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God.)  “He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.  But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed  we all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers was silent, so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgement he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.  Yet it was the LORD'S will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offering and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death and was numbered with transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. (Isaiah 53: 2-12)  The Ten Commandments are called the moral law, we broke the law Jesus paid the fine. So God can let you go even though you're guilty. "He saved us not because of righteous things we've done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit" (Titus 3:5)  "God demonstrates his own love towards us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8) "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) "Death was swallowed up in victory." (1 Corinthians 15:54)  (1) All you need to do is confess and repent ( turning away completely) from all your sins to God alone; no other person.  "He who covers his sin will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy."  (Proverbs 28:13)   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful to and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)  "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord." (Acts 3:19)  Repentance is a continual process and not a one time thing.  (2) Have Faith in Jesus Christ alone, trusting him like a parachute on the day of God's wrath.  "Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what is not seen " (Hebrews 11:1)  If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. (Romans 10:9-10)  "For by grace you are saved through faith and not that of yourselves; it is a free gift of god, not of works, lest anyone should boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)  (3) Then surrender to God by letting God guide you in all your ways, through the bible; KJV recommended. Only God can save you not people.  "For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. it teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and live self controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age," (Titus 2:11-12)  "For Christ also suffered once for sins, just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. "(1 Peter 3:18)  Through Jesus you'll be born again.  "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John 3:3)   Jesus you will be given a new heart that desires righteousness and what is Just.  "For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Corinthians 5:21) "This righteousness is given through Faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe." (Romans 3:22)  "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of God's Grace that he lavished on us." (Ephesians 1:1-8)  You'll be free from the control of sin through Jesus and you'll be added to his new family.   " His purpose was to create in himself a new humanity " (Ephesians 2:15)  "But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature;" (Galatians 5:13)  When Are You Going To Get Right With God?  Remember this is your eternal life and God is offering it as a free gift in Jesus Christ. "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among  men by which we must be saved." (Acts 4:12)  You either believe or reject this offer, It's your choice. I'll leave you with this: "What shall profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? " (Mark 8:36)   If you're taking this seriously, Would you like a prayer? This prayer is not a guarantee that you'll be saved, that's between you and God. However, I'd like this to be a good start for your journey.       "Father, I thank you for this person's open heart and ask that he/she would repent and trust alone in Jesus christ. I also ask that you guide their steps on their journey so that they would pass from death to life. In Jesus name amen.
Kind of dissapointed in a way with the pricing. Ryzen 5 5600x for 300 dollars? I truly hope there are some cpus in the 200 dollar market that would smoke my Ryzen 5 2600...if not. I will wait another generation. But you deserve to be the king for a while AMD.
Not ruling out that my next CPU will be Intel, because according to market's law AMD will be more expensive if they will continue like this.
drollest afterclap
I'm not usually one to sit in on a fanboy circlejerk, but dang it fellas ya need to make some room. AMD is not only stepping their game up, but seems to drastically increased performance per dollar for this generation.
Will upgrade from a 7700k to a 5800X hahah I will be soo happy
Well. Up to 6% more Performance in Gaming. But Intel i9 costs about 300 less...  Sad to see AMD leaving the best price attitude behind...
Finally AMD proved that 'never lose hope in bad times'. Try harder and success will be surely yours. 🎉🎉🎉
yes i love amd, intel is crap, but sorry mate you cant beat nvidia
AMD be like: Don't mind us, just putting a few more nails in Intel's coffin.
“we want to disrupt the pc market” *translate:* “we want to humiliate intel.”
Poor Intel
microstuttering garbage. fix yous products!
So... I gotta pay $150 more PLUS the price of a cooler to get very similar performance to my 3700x? yeah no thanks
is that a man? Wtf am I even looking at?
:O Borderlands 3 - RADEON 6000 series ❤
Ryzen 5000: greatest performance leap for CPUs  Ampere: greatest performance leap for GPUs  _perfectly balanced as all things should be_
I am hopin price for Amd Ryzen 3500 will go down after this
Goddamn I need a new pc
"MADE IN CHINA" It comes from CHI _ NA !
Dont now much bout tha gams here but i reckon you youngins er jus havin yurselfs a good time is all.
Thanks AMD! I've been using Ryzen processor since first generation till now the 3000 series and no doubt I'll move to the 5000 series.
so this always new processor and videocard so plss introduce a new cases for AMD.
@24:27 shadow of the tomb raider running a nvidia 2080ti not a AMD GPU
Thank you AMD
Lisa the best thing to ever happen to AMD.
Lol i was going to buy a ry 5 3600 yesterday but im glad i didnt now for 100 bucks more i can get performance of a ryzen 7 3700 on steroids with a ryzen 5 5600  im so hyped u?
beating dead bodies for 24 mins straight
Intel stock holders: "We're never going to make our money back, are we?"  AMD stock holders: "HERE COMES THE MONEY, MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY"
This year's presentation looked so much more professional holy sheet. They've come a long way since 2017
Red AMD PCiE-4.0 > blue intel pcie-3.0  Send me four or eight exemplares of all your products for free, thank you in advance.  I would love to use the Ryzen5950x, RadeonRx6900 with the AoRus x570 Xtreme.  If had those, I could have done already one two videos of my World-Rescue-Offers. There would be less Fires, Floods and Deadly Accidents all around the world already, because I know important things since over 15 years.
Boom! Take the Power and destroy Intel. Thats great.
Can we all just take a min and look at her shoes?? :D
Covid-19 isn’t as bad as the media made it out to be. We were expecting a grizzly bear but we got a stray cat instead

Operations Manager: So how many companies you would like to destroy? Dr. Lisa: All of 'em! Kill 'em all!
. Overall AMD really stepped up
AMD = confidence Intel = arrogance
Intel Coffee Lake? More like Coffin Lake. HAHA, GOTTEM!
I talk to my diarrhea on a daily basis
AMD, take care of Lisa Su, the best CEO in your history.
So AMD passed Intel in performance and seconds later AMD became Intel in price. Guess we're getting double teamed from now on instead of just getting screwed by Intel alone. I'm fully expecting another price hike at the end of the month with RX 6000 just like AMD followed Nvidia's price hikes with RX 5000.
Hefty prices tho
👏👏👏👏🤯🤯🤯🤯
Very nice, Well done AMD.
so they made their chips properly this time with a proper single core performance and now intel have  nothing to compete... so amd was winning in cores/multi core performance, price and efficiency... and was lossing a bit in single core / gaming... so now they win in every aspect... so now there is absolutelly no excuss to buy intel lel xD
26%!!!!!!wtf
20% IPC increase would be nice, plus 10-20% of clock speed increase can drag me over the line for new cpu.
PepeLaugh RightPointingFinger Flame
Happy with my 3950x.
How to not miss live videos from amd?
**busts a move**  GO LISA GO LISA GO,  GO LISA GO LISA GO
Dr Lisa shower us with those gaming cores
Close to a perfect presentation: -Short -On point -No bullshit  I only wish that the sound was a bit better (Lisa for the most part), something was a little "off" sometimes. Now I just want to see reviews and benchmarks before probably getting a 5900x to replace my 3600 (still good, but want something a bit better).
This is absolutely amazing. R.I.P Intel
Yes. The official name for RDNA2 is now "Big Navi"
rip intel
AMD has really put Intel into hell.
isnt league of legends dx9 game still lmao
Badass CEO.
I became a AMD fan because of Ryzen's integrated graph on the "G" models, I expect that the launch of the 6000 GPU series allow me to buy a rx 580 here in Brazil. The prices are higher than ever!
Im not an expert, I was just thinking, since nvidea has NVENC encoders, what upgrades does streamers and video editors get in BIG NAVI?
Wow all with 105 TDP
cpu:intel yes! gpu:amd yes!
Intel has Disconnect
She got a better mic the last video I watched the microphone was terrible.
Let me guess next yr another gen? XD
Meanwhile Intel: "We will release a totally new design in January 2021! 14++++!" Husband to wife: "Cancel the gender reveal party, I don't want to see anything blue."
AMD: We will soon move to 5nm Intel: We will soon add one more +
Looks like 600 Intel employees are watching , same amount of dislike.
The figures say Covid is bearly a blip. Certainly not a pandemic.
Dont know if I'm digging the price for a 28% performance increase I have a Ryzen 9 3950X I should be ok for next or following generation release
Están dañando la relación precio vs beneficio : (
Too expensive only 6 cores..... meh
If the prices got a $50 Off! When they launch!   Theres no gonna be stock again until 2022...
AMD presentation increased by 50% in IPC compared to previous one's, they forgot to say Zen 3 it's simply better in every way though.
but the Ryzen 5600x is a bit to expensiv. i would hope for a <250€ price point
All the dislikes are intel employees
141 vs 181 FPS doesn't matter at all.. anything over 60fps and your eyes won't notice it
my 6700k oc at 5ghz is homeless now
Looking forward, to see more exiting Technology from AMD. Great Work, I love that stuff you are producing and please never stop to being a important part of the future, of technology. My highest Respekt is granted.
wait i just went to amazon i9 10900k is below 1k but this 5950 is over 1k when converted to cad i thought this is cheaper
Plot twist: these numbers are from the mid-range RX6000 series
I see upgrade comming to my rig, this time will be blasting red all over it. Last time I got something from red team was HD4770X2.
Challenge:        Do a pushup each time they say "gamer"
I want to ditch my 4770k for dat Ryzen
I can feel him breathing down my neck
AMD never needs an advertisement to boast its product. Their work speaks!
Looks like I'm upgrading to a 16 core...
That 10 first seconds...
Captions unavailable 🦻🏼😑
When's the 1 nm processors?
Please please put some money AMD into Linux and Linux gaming. As a 5700XT / 3900x user I'm tired of the bugs trying to get games and Davinci to work on linux. With an Nvidia it's puds.
MARK.....Master of Paper.....
I used to prefer Intel over amd before, but definitely buying one of these new cpus along with a 3080 for my new build
So is Intel actually slower at gaming now? If so I am building my first AMD desktop.
guys i have a i7 4790k and i know thats old but is this cpu a big upgrade from mine?
Very good work AMD! I'll look forward for the Ryzen 3. @Robert Hallock; Nice shoes, but they are abit too tall, aren't they?
24:46 - Lol, they ran the benchmarks with Nvidia GPUs. :D
AMD= AWFULLY MADE DEVICES
THANKS AMD!!!! 👍👏👏👏
AMD, zen 3 is too expensive!
So I can use this new ryzen as an apu? Meaning no dedicated video card, just vega?
Remember remember the 5th of november.... :P
Come to papa!!
AMD is best 👑👑👑 Good by intel and Nvidia good byeeeeeee 👋👋👋 AMD> İntel and Nvidia I'm waiting Rx 6900XT(Nvidia killer)
Where the ryzen 3 5100x or 5300x?
meh, ill just wait for zen 4. 5nm though.
Shut up and take my money!!!
When I first switched from consoles to PC - Ryzen was my go to. Nothing but good things to say. Time to upgrade.
any news about this meltdown / spectre things? ;) no one speaks about it any more but is the design nowadays fixed?
Have been long time user of AMD CPU and haven't regretted one bit until now👍 Everytime when I go for mobo upgrade, I thought going for intel chipset for a change but their pricing couldn't win me over
Been sitting on this 1600 all this time. I just didn't see the need to upgrade because it just wasnt necessary at the time. It was a more of a want than a need but zen vs zen 3 oh yeah its a need!! Come to papa!
I'm excited for when the ryzen 9 will be called *RYZEN 9 6900X* "nice"
How bad did AMD kicked Intel ass with Zen3? Big time? Very big time!
Where is ryzen 3 ?
looks like big navi is a midrange card .....  CPUs are awesome tho
I usually never get excited , happy or anything about corporations , but something about amd being beaten down for years and being a huge underdog for so long and seeing them come back in such a big way not only in the cpu market , but seemingly in the gpu market all at the same time while just a few years ago basically close to going out of business. Lisa Su probably isn't paid enough for steering that ship away from what it once was. I haven't owned an amd cpu probably since 2005 or so until i got my 3700x and an amd gpu probably since around then as well. Now i'm considering having both in my system depending on where big navi lands. Grats to the whole amd team, keep pushing like this and keeping prices competitive and don't gouge us like intel has over the years and don't EVER get complacent , that's excatly why intel is where they are now. They just wanted to keep feeding us minor improvements for maximum profits.
Wow Jeff bazos also works a AMD, this guy
Intel: Gaming happens with Intel  AMD: Gaming begins with AMD
I just bought an ryzen 3600
Just need Corsair to release a Corsair One with both an AMD CPU and GPU
she watches the full nerd...and named big navi because the public named it big navi?  She's not the CEO of AMD.  She's the CEO of the World!
Very happy with the new CPU's and can not wait to get the 5900x ^^. The GPU however seems a bit weak compared to the new RTX 3080/3090 cards. When you look at benchmarks BL it seems the AMD card will be competing with the 3060 and maybe a 3070 :(. Still hope it gets more performance so I can get a all AMD pc in the future.
when AMD start destroying Intel market
AMD just nuked intel
Still a bit upset, that 4750g series is not selling comercial like 3400g
Agent 47 telling me that it passed cinebench 631 on single core? I'll take your entire stock!!
5900x and rtx 3090 still cant run 8 bit mario
5950X price is a bit high... :(
Getting 3600x and rdn2 next year
Does AMD have an answer against CUDA? If yes, I'm buying AMD..
hype is real
But can it run flight simulator?
Great presentation! If I were to build a PC Gamer now I'd choose AMD. No doubt.
Good to see the slides showing negative (@17:21 - Battlefield V) and tie results (@21:16 - Far Cry New Dawn) in terms of gaming performance; I hope this transparency continues.  @11:34 That architecture change... dayumn. Will definitely help with the gaming performance on consoles.  @19:19  I'm so glad I spent the time researching for ages and I went with a X570 when I built my PC. Upgrading from the 2700X to the 5900X is going to be a massive in socket upgrade 😱.   The price point also keeps another upgrade path open, I can upgrade to the 3900X as that would be significantly cheaper when I get around to upgrading. So effectively it would be 2700X --> 3900X --> 5950X.   I get why 4000 series was skipped for the desktop market as it nicely ties up with the 500 series chipsets and differentiates from the 4000 series Zen 2 laptop processors.   Can't wait for Big Navi to upgrade my RX 480.
Man, i wish i can buy a new pc just to support this kind of company
AMD: double the performance Intel: double the price
More than a decade later, AMD takes the gaming crown! Epic music, just amazing AMD. This brings me back to the 3800+ gaming days! Such great memories. Thank you!
still trying to find a commend about AMD and not intel
"Still at 105w". Yikes, she didn't hold back on that one 😂
So 5600x  =  10600k???
F to intel
AMD is so multithreaded - even their chip development process is parallelized.
GG AMD! supporting you since  1997
I love Lisa. Such a good job has been done with AMD. I feel so proud of someone I don't even know.
Ah, there are 521 thumps down, Intel was watching too?
hm who is playing 1080P those days?
Hopefully all these numbers stand up to third-party scrutiny, cuz it’ll be nice to see an actual competitive space in CPUs *AND* GPUs for all of us. Don’t drop the ball AMD! 🤞🤞
I'm a little disappointed with the pricing. Please, AMD, don't become the new intel. :(
semoga 3900x seken semakin terjangkau
Guess I'm getting a ps5.. both...
I'm sold to AMD. Lower power consumption, and for what I play is more than enough. and I have 10 fps lower than intel, at a lower price, and lower power consumption.  Power consumption for me is really important in home as I have 2 PC's that are on at least 8 hours / day.    Competition is good, hope AMD is gonna go stronger and stronger.
This is why I wait! Here's hoping both launches go well.
all I hear is trash
all I hear is trash
High heels are so much better than turtlenecks...
everyone saying better than i9 yet we still bottlenecked by cpu with 3080
Man I fell in love with AMD since they released their first gen Ryzen :'>
Wow - you just saved me $299! Thanks, AMD!
Intel will respond,.... eventually
I'm wearing black, cause I just attended Intel's funeral
intel is dead now really...
Pricing policy is changing for the worse :-(
A couple more Zen generations, and we may return to the software rendering instead of GPUs
I’m eating cookies
_Coffin: Intel Inside_
oh i see what is coming ... intel  gets pissed off and they bring a new socket in
Ryzen 2000 users, our time had come 😁
Intel : pls buy my 14nm++++++++++++ cpu
Now add Thunderbolt 4 support and  I will end world hunger.
O V E R P R I S E :-(
Intel punching air rn xD
INTEL I9
I will be going with Intel... Optane so that I have storage that can keep up with my Zen 3 chip!
The 559 dislikes must be from intel fanboys
Damn, time to upgrade from my Ryzen 1700.🤣🤣
so the entire next gen console fight will be powered by AMD. so no matter who wins that fight, AMD has ALREADY won. "i play both sides so i always come out on top"
AMD is ruling the roost. Now, when should I change my FX processor?
The Ryzen 5950X is the processor to rule them all
Shot drinking game: Everytime "leadership" is mentioned. Just have someone ready to pump your stomach though :D
Question i got confused... so 5950x if you want to game and do content? 5900x if you want to game only? Did i get it right?
as a guy with 2 desktops and 2 laptops all powered by ryzen cpus i will say that the zen 3 is a bad launch, the increase in price is NOT justified by any means other than pure corporate greed, i will stick to my 1600x, 1700, 2500u and 3700x tyvm. Next build might even be Intel.
As someone who runs many virtual machines on KVM I wonder if the 5900X is worth an upgrade?
Does Big Knobby do ray tracing though?
Zen 3 socket is am4?
Looks like we can expect $50 on top of the equivalent Zen 2 MSRPs
I wouldn't just jump ship yet. I would like to know the conditions of how their turbo boost works along with the other cores, and if it's limited time/board based. Also, the memory controller: Intel has more support and better memory overclocking support compared to AMD. I think I am happy with the 10900k for now and save the extra $300 compared to their top tier CPU. The only thing going for AMD is the PCI-E gen 4 support.
It really shows how the marketing director speaks more naturally. Just an appreciation.
Somebody know when they be released
Nice job AMD Teams (y)
when will they be released?
pog pog pog pog pogu
Big props to AMD!! All the hard work they did really payed off surpassing intel now. I gotta 10600k rn but amd lookin real nice now!
RIP Intel, you won't be missed.
cya chips intel
Everything is good about zen 3, except price.
AMD great again! Thank you Lisa Su! 🖖
LISA DROPPING THAT HEAT 😳😳😳
Scalpers enter the chat.
Amd : call Intel  : ......?
this video needs a better title
Finally AMD beats intel at gaming. The only thing what intel was good in :P
I hope papermaster doesn't pull a paperlaunch on us :P
I am waiting for the next gen threadripper.
AMD rekting Intel and then suiciding to NVIDIA in the last 2 minutes
Let me just ask thee most important question. What and how are you guys planning on dealing with Bots and all that nonsense? EVGA has a pretty solid plan.
The 50-ish % increase in CSGO and LoL are really necessary, why have 500 fps if you can also have 750 😄
When you sell that CPU, just send it to the stores so people can buy it in person. We all know if you try to sell it online, scalpers will just get to it!
*cries in Intel*
that 544 person, who dont like this video is INTEL's workers :D
Exelente... ;-)
WIN!
5950x at $800 is a joke.
AMD, give us OC RAM 4000+ MHz  :)
Ryzen 5 1600X = $250 Ryzen 5 2600X = $230 Ryzen 3600X = $250 Ryzen 5 5600X= $300  Those previous-gen CPUs were already considered as a bad value cause non-x variants performed the same for $50 less. So in reality, the price increase is $100. The 5600X already has a 65W TDP so, there won't be a 5600. If there is a 5600, it will most likely have 3 cores per CCD, which means lower performance in games. (Look at the 3100 vs 3300X)  The 5900X is around 5% faster on average than a stock 10900K in games. Since a tuned 10600K performs like a stock 10900K, The 5600X will most likely perform like that 10600K($275).  Zen 3 is the last-gen on the AM4 socket while on intel's side, 10th gen owners still have Rocket lake ahead before DDR5. (Intel recently confirmed that Rocket lake will be released in Q1 of next year)
Nice Dr. Sue very nice.
Actually AMD (3000 Series) is Competing with (New 5000 Series).. BTW Intel is Still Relaxing and Watching it's launch Event..
In my country everything is super expensive, $1000 pc builds cost $2000 in my country 😠😠😠😠😠
A big up for AMD, I really love the fact that they achieved their goal. I own 4790k intel core i7 cpu and I really like that they surpassed Intel. Hope they surpass nVidia too..!!
AMD YES!
Intel BTFO
People Waiting for Nov 5 to buy 549$ CPUs.... Me : waiting for Zen3 based 99$ APUs...
Congratulation. AMD is back on stage!
Why bother with the stage stuff? Could’ve done this on a simple set huh?
Bruh, 300$ for 5600, hope that's only for x version cause it's quite expensive
LMAO let's not forget that intel owns x86.
Lisa Su really out here wearing a full length sleeve shirt and high heels. What a power move lol
I have a 2700x, 3800xt, and a 4700U love my Ryzen Processors
They are literally saying, they rule both the pc and console worlds.
Battlefield 5 somehow performed worse. Good job, EA.
So uh... What's the generational difference between this new stuff, and say.... A ryzen 1700? :^
If Big Navi is faster than the 3090 I will build a new machine thats only spec with AMD and Radeon....
Love that you also put the negative benchmarks too. Transparency gives me more confidence in buying from AMD
$300 for 5600X, dang that's expensive
11:26 "With Allah's blessing, I issue the following fatwa... as for [Intel users]... show no mercy. You may exterminate every single one of them on the spot, may Allah bear witness to my words..." - Ayatollah Lisa al-Su 08.10.2020 What did she mean by this?
Upcoming>>> CoffinLake: *Intel Inside* ⚰️
GG intel
Broo they fail to hype this up, too much bla bla bla
Good bye Intel 🙏
AMD: *is more expensive than Intel* AMD fanboys: Wait, that's illegal
Well like always I wait till things get released to see it actually tested and not really care about PR bs that companies release since we clearly seen in the past is not always correct in real world scenarios  Also this means nothing to me since it's 1080p gaming they are talking about and I tend to 1440p and 4k gaming... The last one announced may be it however again gotta wait till released
What about APUs?
So no new mainboards? No x670? I'll pass, waiting for Zen4. x570 was and still is a disgrace.
17% faster with a 400 MHz frequency deficit... Intel needs Rocket Lake pronto, not in five months.
The prices are too high, where is the $99 and $149 price point?  $269, yeah right!
Was not expected the heels. Not gunna lie
This is how you write a strong female character.
Zen 3 has higher prices than Zen 2 :(
Sold.... take my money..... that was easy!
I love you Dr. Lisa Su.
I thought doctors were sworn to preserve life... that looked more like a mercy killing to me.
Awesome AMD, love you Lisa!!!!
It feels amazing that I am watching this on my PC with a Ryzen 5 3600 on it.
Intel just lost the only thing they could brag about.. single core performance. Enjoy being the overall loser intel you had it coming
6 cor 299$ ;..(
Is the 5600x better then the 3700x ?
time to new build
ryzen 5 5600x 300$ ???
AMD here we go  💥 💥 💥 💥 Intel : need backup
Expensive...
I see what you're doing with perceived value being an important component of getting the brand image where you want it to be. I don't like $300 for six cores. I thought we were done with that. I'm glad I got my 3700X when you were still about breaking boundaries :/  Incredible engineering and performance aside, I think 250 for 6 cores would've been a better balance. I'm not the expert though, just my two cents.
Lisa why you leave me ! Oh hi mark
Ryzen has risen *epic music*
Remember, remember, the 5th of November.
I'm not smart enough to make a joke that gets thousands of likes here. I thought 3rd gen was already out. i'm so confused.
Ryzen 3 5000series ???  🤐
AMD:  Intel: Why do I hear boss music?
$300 for 6 cores.  -AMD 2020
AMD  CPU  Attack:🐘 🐅 INTEL CPU Attack: 🐖🐩
wait for 5nm Zen 4 in early 2022
No one is gonna mention how BF5 gets -3% performance? Mad respect for AMD for transparently pointing that out though, much balls.
go ryzen be the best
Let’s be honest AMD pushed  DDR4 High speed ram  Pice 4.0 High cores
She kinda bad tho
mrd, no hay subittulos
I was waiting & expecting (8 cores, 16 threads) CPU for $300~350 😔 like 3700X pricing in the past. but for $300 there is (6 cores, 12 threads) I don't like it Sadly prices are higher than before!
I'm so exciting of the release even though I can't even afford to buy a PC
What is for entry-level gaming like 4 and 8 red and another 6 4 and 6 thread $299 are more price
I sure hope they don't run out of stock when it releases .
High heels and scruffy clothes not a good look
Why is it 5000 series, did they skip 4000 series desktop processors
I hope we'll get a Zen 3 APU eventually
What up with the -3% bfV ?
AMD, yes
Wow, congrats guys. Where is DDR5? Love Ryzen.
19:26
Even if intel releases a new processor and ends ups beating amd , amd still wins because of its price and how good it performs
I'm actually really worried about the pricing AMD came up with. 5600x for $300 vs  3600XT is $250 on release with only .1 GHz increase? hopefully, when some benchmarks come out we can really see the prices being worth it. I was really hoping to get an eight-core processor for $350 like when the 3700x released. now $450!!! that's crazy!!! 3900xt is $480 right now. however is AMD really does have the gaming and compute crown I can see why they did this. it's just unfortunate that the underdog best price to performance option is coming up with the same prices as intel. I am really hoping that the 5800x can beat the 10700k substantially. for $50 dollars more it better.
HELP. the X6XX CPU is a favorite but $300 is steep this generation, would the $150 difference to the 3600 & and those funds be better put in a higher tier card... preferably the 2nd highest card  what ever that may be for $350
19:02 PRESS F TO BUY ME: SPAMS BUTTON
This is just a massacre
rip intel
PUMPED
Блин, да даже интервью Дудя с Навальным популярнее чем презентация новых процессоров от АМД!!! Почему?
Look, Intel, this how you do it: Not a single word other than "competition" mentioned only a couple of times and a model name to identify said competition. AMD is not here to sell "competition".
Is it too late for Dr. Lisa Su to run for president? Cause I'm buying what she's selling
Seems good, but that price though is eeeehhhh......... a bit of an intel thing to do. Big navi appears to be close to a 3080 in performance, hopefully at a lower cost.
Is intel humiliated by amd? In this video?
14:11 = TO I9 10900K'S DEATH
The Only DR I trust
I'm sooo glad I invested in Ryzen when I built my first PC earlier this year.
i bought a ryzen 3700x to early
Lisa: *Reveals the 5600x, 5800x, and 5900x*  Also Lisa: But im not done yet!
13:01 INTEL WHERE U AT ???!!!
bruh where da budget bois at? this was really disappointing.
12:30 SAYS IT ALL. BYE SEE YOU LATER!
i think amd likes sony more than microsoft.
Great backgrounds and stage settings for this presentation. Very Tron!
Intel is dead now 😂😂😂
Bye Intel :DDDDD
Intel in pink wojak mode
You hear that? It’s intel still changing their socket for no reason every 18 months to milk customers.
Where is my apu??
I have an i3 6100.
Lets hope People won’t overhype this and Enable the scalpers!!
How many tabs I can run on chrome?
Intel must be shaking like a dog shitting in snow🤭
500 dislike come from 14nm fanboys
AMD No.1!! Lisa Su♥
Just take my money , I wont complain
She kinda hot imo
For the first time in my life, my PC will be 100% AMD hardware armed to the teeth, for next GEN
This is incredible! Great job, Team AMD!
AMD: We just beat Intel in every way! AMD 5 mins later: We just beat our 5 min ago selves!
BIG NAVI!!!! Hell yeah
AMD: We're focused on execution. Intel: quickly, hide your neck.
But... When we can buy 4000 series APU's ?
Should have shorted intel stock dammm
Sad ryzen 5 1600x noises. Just kidding, my r5 1600x is still a great cpu!
AMD will have a win ... just if you have decent stock levels at launch
I still likely will buy myself the Nvidia cards. but I feel like AMD has completely buried intel as far as CPUs go.
Can I trade in my Core i7 6700K for a Ryzen 9? 🤩
Skipped 4 because afraid of SheSheLaoBa
inb4 more ram incompatibility
i love you Dr. Lisa Su, and the entire AMD team.
be me, who just bought a 10700k with the house burning dow around me bc of how hot it is:  This is fine.
i get 193 avrage fps on shadow of teh tomb raider same settings 10900k 2080ti
Ryzen 5 became 300€ what a trash.
as a gamer, you jsut cant make any more excuses for intel
lisa mon
higher prices and no cooler included !! :(( this is painful
13:20 to save time
A year since I've had my PC RDNA Ryzen 3900X and Radeon 5700XT. Now  they already at RDNA 2 😩. I guess you can't hold back greatness 😎
I came with Cash...  I left with Cache...
Yes it's better, but an 8 core 3700x replacement should be there instead of the 5600. Kinda disappointed by that, guess I'll have to get the 5600(overpriced) but still better than intel.
Am excite.
Mad respect Lisa Su 💯 Damn that was the last nain on Intel's coffin ⚰️, beating a dead horse is still winning Never gonna buy an Intel cpu EVER!!
AMD BEST!
RIP intel 10900k
Sad Total War noises...
I don't even wonna calculate how much I would gain going from 1600x to 5900x
The best part ryzen is going to be backwards compatible to 450 motherboard hell yeah
Flagged for violence, inappropriate content.
Really great advances...but...to be honest lm happy with my 3700x. I wont be upgrading as still altho great advances l only upgrade when l get a massive upgrade.....so for me l will wait for Am5 and ddr5 before l spend any more money. A 3080 or a amd 6000 gpu willbe my only buy this year now and poss a cheap vr for movies due to cinemas demise. I used toupgrade all the time..its a waste of money...you only get 30 tp fourty extra fps for like 400 pounds plus upgrades...unless you need faster more cores for work...l would wait for Am5 and instead grab a new gpu this year as that will give u a much bigger boost than a new cpu...unless you on something older than ryzen 1.
Straight to the point announcement by AMD unlike Apple Time Flies event. 1hr event for just Apple watch and iPads, repeated announcement of A12 and apple pencil😂
Sure hope this is also true for budget builds
Pc:amd Ps5:amd Xbox:amd Soon: You:amd
Zen 3 was so close 5ghz :( still crushing Intel lololol
Well...let me send back my 3900X real quick
good bye intel  🤣 🤣
Cool job
Don't talk about Borderlands 3 in 4k, no one plays that trash.
When preorder ?
same sockets as gen3?
CPU's look fantastic but the pricing needs adjusting Lisa. $299 for the 5600xt is too much $249 at most it should be.
It's nice that they put TIE and negative performance changes in the graphs
Amd please make this the best launch compare to nvidia you can out beat the bot buyers
Pretty cool. I still dont see need to upgrade my good'ol 2600x even after i get a new gen video card though.
2025 3nm+ 9300x 8c16t 4ghz 64mb L3!🤣
Gears 5 RTX 3080 : 72 FPS (Ultra 4k) (Source : Hardware Unboxed) Gears 5 Radeon 6000 Series : *73 FPS* (Ultra 4k)
5:46 I literally thought that was Tim Cook for a good 3 seconds...
I was waiting for the part where they would mention that the 5800x would reach 5 ghz but anyway ar least ryzen 5600 will reach 4.5ghz
Heres a random joke:  People: Cloud gaming  Other people: More like Clown gaming hahahaahhah
As long as radeon doesnt have bad drivers itll be successful
Can't wait! Please just make enough for us to actually buy.
and im over here still running a b350m motherboard and a 1800x  but on another note how about u alz work on fixing the pulse 5600xt  drivers for Fortnite .
LISA SU SAID GAMING PLATFORMS AND ONE OF THEM WAS MOBILE??? NANI?!?!?!?
Ok so ryzen with 7nm bately beats intel, and mind that 10series intel launched at start of the summer, if intel goes 10nm or 7it gonna blow amd out of the water , because amd is a joke having 2 times smaller transistors , but less than 20%performancd above intel.
yeah right, almost every evening i get green screen greeting from my 5600xt when gaming, since the day i bought it, back in april. Had 1050ti for 3 years and not a single crash.
Intel:why are you bullying me?
So Stoked!!
My R9 3950X is proud of you my son 5950x next is waiting to see how tr4 is
Is there -1% performance "uplift" in one of the games?
‘Big Navi’ Radeon RX 6900 XT Beats RTX 3080 plus will cost around $299
Ouch! Price not so good anymore 🤦‍♂️  Gotta wait to see what Intel has to offer
Nice
As expected, kicked Intel's ass, but nowhere near nvidia
"big Navi"!!   <3
remember remember the 5th of novamber
God bless AMD
Intel moves to microwave and toaster processors for their new line of smart home appliances
Lisa Su is an absolute boss, I love her.
TELL TO THEM LISA SU!!!  Ooohhhhhhhhh
hey isn't Mark Papermaster the iPhone 4 guy and left Apple a few years later?? I remember he was called to stand up and accept audience applause by Steve Jobs on iPhone 4 event
@ 3:56 AMD : we are everywhere ...
FIX THE 5000 SERIES GPU BEFORE DROPPING MORE GPU's.  I still get black screen crashes like nobodies business. I've been through 4 5700 XT's this year wiith all of them being stupid unstable
5950x is the next chip in my motherboard!
Intel are watching this in the corner
6 core for $300? Meh!
I am intel/nvidia fan boy  but amd is  soloing them both
5:04 I hate ryzen
AMD starts to get expensive !  :(
CONGRATS GUYS!!! LOOKING FORWARD TO BIG NAVI NOW!!!!
Awsome! I start to think if a replacement of my 3900X makes sense 🤔
Can’t wait during this whole Covid thing minus essentials I haven’t treated myself been waiting for the release of these for a while. Picture fry from futurama take my money......that what is in my mind
911 operator: "911. What is your emergency?" Caller: "Oh my god. Please send someone!" 911 operator: "Sir, please calm down, can you tell me what happen?" Caller: "AMD just murdered Intel for the third time!" 911 operator: "...What?" Caller: "AMD just dug up Intel from the graveyard and freaking murdered it again with Cinebench 1T!!" 911 operator: *'confused noises'*
Subtitles please.
thanks of course AMD, but I do not need the processors for which you artificially raised the prices by $ 100.  The sale of the b550 chipset didn't teach you anything?
That's not a real reflection under Lisa Su, that's Big Navi ray tracing.
Well, my 2600x rig with a 1070 is probably gonna be getting replaced, hot damn
I hear a lot about gaming, but what does Zen 3 offer for workstations and Content Creation?
Why is nobody talking about how they just showed a GPU which is on par with RTX 3080?
Watching AMD murdering Intel is so nice, Intel deserve that , slept with i7 gen2 to gen7 with almost the same IPC and core  count
With the -5% and tie, AMD won my heart ❤️❤️❤️ transparency "has always been" the key.
"We want to disrupt the pc market"  Translate:  "We want to humiliate Intel"
She reiminds me of Sulu from star trek
wait a minute why its - 3 in bf5? 😐
Rip intel
I love watching the scores and then looking at my A8 9600 knowing that I will try to run Cyberpunk on it, if it survives I will update this comment
Get bent intel
I can't wait for Zen 4 so they can name it Ryzen 9 6969X
Dude, AMD is the new genius, these guys are revolutionizing desktop processing at its best!
AMD IS BEST
Lisa dresses like bill gates from the ankles up
I think that AMD never Answer her in comments sad , i want to know when Zen4 comes out middel of 2021?
There are so many ray tracing on the floor i love it !!!!
why the 5000 why its not 4000? Whats with this jump?
Is this the entire stream?
The price is not fair...
Well done guys. Fantastic work. I'm really looking forward to RDNA 2. It's about time team red toppled the giants again. They were getting too big for their boots.
No joke but my first triple A title was on a very budget friendly AMD ryzen 5 3500u, as a student I never thought that I would be able to game until I start earning on my own but the thanks to the perfect price to performance ratio of AMD I have was finally able to play games that my friend would play and won't run on my old laptop. I would have never been able to game with intel. Good Job AMD 👍
👏 great work AMD!
Slightly bummed because I HAD to get some parts to replace my 7 year old PC that was dying.  Got a Ryzen 5 3600 and a B550 Motherboard to replace the old i5-6400 (got it used as a hand me down from my cousin) I had before, because it wasn't cutting it in most of the games I was playing and I wanted something to be ready for Cyberpunk 2077 come November. I already have a card that can handle the game based on the recommended requirements CDPR released.  The nice thing is that because I have this board, I can upgrade to the 5600X a little bit later down the line if the 3600 doesn't cut it for me and my 700W power supply ensures that I only have to buy the processor and that's it. I adore this about AMD; they stick to their board sockets and make us not have to worry about compatibility and we only have to get a new board once in a while.  I couldn't wait anymore because my current hard drives were dying and I needed replacements (have two mechanicals, got two SSDs to replace them thanks to a sweet deal) and the processor was beginning to stutter and it just straight up wasn't doing what I wanted for gaming.  That and my friend is gonna travel from Florida to here in Jamaica so I couldn't pass up the chance to get this stuff soon (shipping anything to Jamaica is a nightmare) rather than having to sell my kidney to pay for damned duty and customs costs.  This made me happy, but also kind of sad because if I had a hundred bucks more along with an extra month to wait, I'd have no doubt gotten that 5600X because that's just absurd. 300 bucks to get that kind of performance?!  Still, excited to see how the 3600 performs. AMD continues to blow Intel out of the water with value and performance. This should be a lesson to Intel to tone themselves down and stop overpricing the hell out of their chips.
Definitely going Amd with my new PC-Build next year, at least for the CPU. Absolutely amazing
3800X 400€          3900X  450€           5800X  450€          5900X 550€        ... 100€ more for same cores Nummer ... i dont like it so much .
so for the Ryzen 5, there's only the 5600X? no regular 5600 for maybe a bit cheaper? damn I was kinda hoping to score myself the new CPU but I'm not going over 200ish dollars on a CPU
хороший однако прирост ,да и на ядро тож радует,надеюсь цены у нас не вырастут пропорционально производительности
Intel :  Gaming Means Intel +++++ Amd : Ohk..
dont buy the zen 3, wait like me till the 5nm hits the market
You know it's a good leadership when the leaders didn't mention "Intel".
thanks amd now i dont what to buy and what to do😬
$300 for the 5600X? AMD is becoming the new Intel!
AMD leaving china... Isn't that would have been the news to tell?
Now I can get that 3950x for the low.
but can it run flight simulator 2020?
this woman... beyond the shadow of a doubt is a geius
will there be 5600 under 260$??
Intel : We are Gaming King Amd : let's End thier Career! (Drinks Slowly)
When Mark came in I thought it was Tim cook llamao 😂
Intel : We are Gaming King Amd : Hold my bear! (Intel drinks quietly in pain)
I wish Dr. Lisa Su is my aunt.
Intel is dead forever
I'm just about to join the Ryzen gang with the 3200G. excited !!!
Borderlands 3 3080 = 69fps Big navy = 61fps 2080ti = 50fps  Gears 5 3080 = 76fps Big navy = 73fps 2080ti = 61fps  fonte: benchmark 3080 founders guru3d
Intel : We are Gaming King Amd : Think Again
Can't say I'm happy about the price.
is the 60fps 4k the 6600/6600xt/6700/6700xt i wonder ?
Intel fires Koduri, kidnaps Lisa. Jensen disguises himself with a denim jacket.
so in the zen 4 announcement, they will compare the zen 3 against the zen 4?
at last. they peed on Intel and in gaming
I want to see AMD partner up with arm and welcome to make the best phone processor
2025 3nm+ x86 4c4t 2.5ghz cpu + 1.3ghz gpu phone 10w 🤣
*inhale*
King is back nvidia 30 series is dead
AMD, I love you!!
RIP 🤣🤣🤣🤣 INTEL
who in their mind would get 5800x over 5900x ? idk seems odd to me
ok, so in definitive AMD is the best.
There's so many cuts and angles in this video... it's not necessary to do that. With or without an on-site audience. I do really like the brevity (or let's say... quick talk pace) of the presentation though.
Thinking about upgrading... but damn I literally just build my pc a month ago 😢
The prices are terribly high, im sorry amd, im buying an intel for my next pc.
AMD, you need to give Lisa 100,000,000$ bonus!
As Ric Flair would say: WOOO!!
Been waiting for so long
Can Radeon new series do 8K?
AMD may kick ass but just wait for Intel Dead Fish Lake :P
Intel: I cant destroy you... but he can!! - Microsoft flight simulator enter the room
Well, Intel is not excited 😂
Show fortnite benchmarks its the most played game
Will this run cool math games at 60 FPS?
Sus precios son muy altos, que pena.
So , what was it about?  GAMING. GAMING , GAMING
Intel Coffin Lake confirmed!
rip intel
This looks great, can't wait for Ryzen 3s that I can actually afford lmao
No subtitles ? (((
I hope for the processors to be cheaper because of fewer chiplets.
.... performance uplift = price uplift
everyone who disliked is people who bought I9 10900K
poggers
AMD: I’m going to ruin this guys whole career Intel: ☠️
Mother Lisa giveth! Adopt me pls.
Thx Amd ....thx to you i will have my Intel Stronger then Ever..!!!!! Already saw this movie Years ago .....and i know how it Ends ....!!!
Intel should release a coffin dance video for themselves
Looks at 1600x, wellllllllp guess I’m upgrading.
Those 488 dislikes from the last few Intel bulls?
Intel going braaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
not wanna ruin the hype or anything but you can get a 3700 for less than the price of a 5600
AMD knows no competition from Intel, thus prices are rising for AMD. God i wish intel had AMD on their toes.
rest in peace intel lol, imma buy this on xmas intstead of i9
What is IPC
AMD,YES！！！
Nice presentation.
We love you Lisa Su.
definately going amd in my next pc build
The real question is, will they come with heat sink?
"wow I'd want all this stuff!"     *$10 cash*
Info starts at 6:50
Hehehehe, But that price though
radeon 6000 vs rtx 3090 pls
Oh, damn.
21:02 too much 59. haha! LOL fifty nine fifty nine fifty nine. AMD is the new 6ix9ine
Thank you for this presentation AMD :)
Thank you AMD  Thank you for changing the CPU and soon the GPU market Thank you for making other companies offer more for less price Thank you for not fearing failure Thank you for beneficiating us customers Thank you for not being greedy and being honest with us  Rise up AMD, thanks so much.  - Every Gamer PC costumer
so the 5800x is still cheaper than intel's i9 8c 16t counterpart... but by like $20
That was ... amazing
*Throws money at screen*  Is it November 5th yet?
Jensen shows his Ampere GPU from his kitchen and Lisa announce Big Navi from her virtual garage
Intel: Oh boy, look this new RTX series, we can run into CPU bottleneck... AMD: Hold my beer....
Love the silence of no crowd
❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Im just waiting for APU blocks, please be cheap
I have an Intel processor, but damn all those Intel Fanboys are shaking in their boots right now.
What a intro with ps5 n xbox series X
AMD are probably not reading this, but... considering the issues many customers faced with the RX5000-series GPU's, what are AMD doing to avoid similar issues with the launch of this upcoming generation of their GPU's? They were mostly driver issues, if I understand correctly, as well as some shoddy craftsmanship from third party developers...?
15:38 when he said cs:go my heart melted ♥️♥️
*looks at my intel i3-9100* *looks at wallet* Sobs.
I hope they get a lot cheaper quickly or the high end 3000s drop
amd: i like ya cut g * slaps intel *
Amd is now ahead of Intel if you wanna spend a lot. Wait a few years, amd will be  on top for everything
can it run minesweeper ultra setting 5fps?
Kudos to these guys. THey have made my PC building experience so positive. Started first with the Ryzen 5 3600 and can't wait to upgrade...once my wife allows it
Please RDNA 2 be good. Im ready to get rid of my used rtx 2070 super for a good price.
Intel only had one leg left to stand on; Single core performance.  AMD: *sweeps leg*
Still running FX, but you never know Ryzen 5000 might actually be worth the upgrade...
Ayeeee! I was about to get a 3950x and 3970x but now gonna get a 5950x and wait for updated threadrippers
My favorite part is where my wallet doesn't feel as light when I buy an Intel Processor
oh wow game over Nvidia and Intel
As a Canadian, there is no way I'm paying $100 more than a 3600x for a 5600x.. Too minimal of a performance increase for that to happen.
RIP Intel
5600x 299.99$?  no way. 249.99$ than everyone will buy this. please~~
And again i don't like the 5800X with the same TDP, less Cores and Cache has the lower max Boost Rating... why? Should be minimum 4.95 / 4.0 It always feels like the "crappy" Cores/Binning are used for the 8-Core CPUs
Soo.... You're looking at an average 28% upgrade in gaming going from 3000-series to 5000-series, right? How much of an upgrade am I looking at, going from an FX-8320 to a low/mid tier 5000-series? :P
Let’s hope it’s not out of stock immediately like the 3080
AMD always ❤️
I guess Lisa wants us to remember remember the 5th of November .. not as guy Fawkes day but zen 3 day
Alternate title: Calling intel noob for 24 minutes straight
I believe those 444 dislikers are Intel employees 😂😂😂
AMD ❤
Not once did they mention "Intel" or "I9 10900K". Meanwhile Intel mentions AMD more often in their presentations than their own products 😃
Pricing...
But can it play Skyrim with my mod list?
I bet Intel is crying right now with its hotplates.
Anyone thinks CEO does the better job in marketing than an actual marketing guy who showed jolted up preview of performance in this video !
How do I work for AMD?
Guys do not be „disappointed“ that 5 GHz stock weren‘t achieved, you can easiy overclock a few-hundred of MHz like in the Ryzen 9 5950X just 100 MHz should be possible with even a stock cooler if there would be provided.  It is still a huge performance jump and absolutely crushes intel, in my opinion. Though I know AMD may have dropped the clever marketing strategy of advertising 5 GHz cpu‘s, it doesn‘t matter, overclocking to 5 GHz is going to be do-able ;)  Especially Single Core Performance was improved, something we hoped for a long time very much, thanks AMD (and lets not forget the very fair prices)!
She's holding back her excitement but her voice throttles with happiness.
How will they deal with scalpers?
Brutality, fatality, Ultra-combo and WICKED SICK all in one.... Stroked Intel team must be in intensive care
The Earth will miss Intel.
Amd good intel bad     give me likes now
benchmark cyberpunk 2077 is the only benchmark that counts this year
Love AMD and enjoy AMD
Amd is new intel
So the entire Ryzen 5K stack has gone up by $50 in each tier. This does not bode well for rrp of 6800XT and 6900XT. To recap launch rrp -  3700X = $329. 3800X = $399.  3900X = $499. 3950X = $749.  5700X = ? 5800X = $449. 5900X = $549. 5950X = $799.
Epic
AMD <3
Love them!
Please fixed stuck frequency problem , i am facing in my Ryzen 9 3900x with X570 chipset!,!
300$ for the Ryzen 5 ?!!?!?!?
5600 триста бачей? нет, спасибо лучше уж 10400f
>tfw when Intel is biting the dust so hard, that you have to compare your new CPU to your old CPU, cuz it would just look artificial to make charts with +300% results XD
Intel just got destroyed well I’m officially team AMD now😂
Very promising, but what about x670? No new motherboards?
AMD,YES! Intel,吔屎！
12:19   Direct Comparison to Core i9 ??  Is it Allowed in Events ?
I bet even AMD were using the 3090 for these benchmarks😂
Oh no... This is a bad day for Intel.. 🤣🤣
Im still using a 2011 amd fx 6300 processor and i can still play games at 120 fps
just one think to say : ooooofffff
I've thought that the prices will be low 😭
That was epic!
Those dislikes are from INTEL fanboys.. 😂🤣
Ga hp ga pc, yang oren-oren emang suka ngacak²
Guys Intel 11th Gen CPUs are Class apart.....Just Watch Dave2D Takedown on 11th gen Intel Silicon
I just got the coldest chills when that beat dropped and the background changed at 22:00
Borderlands 4k 60fps?   Was that big navi or the new Xbox?
You could have had a slam dunk launch but you decided to outprice even intel. No thanks
Интел всё.
It is lunch time at school right now. I have two unit tests of this afternoon. Instead of studying, I'm watching AMD launch zen 3!
ngl she looks like a guy
Everyone saying rip and ggs intel when 11th gen hasn't even come out lol
i am waiting new radeons and of course i should buy ryzen 9 5900x
Intel is so SCREWED!
i think i can finally update my FX8350 build from 2013.
f
Overpriced
I am gonna watch it again and again
It feels like when Ryzen releases a video, it is a big no no for Intel. 🤣
Intel : look how they massacred my boy  :(
I know that 2020 is not a good year. But i can confidently say that 2020 is the best year for gamer
Love you  lisa su
fawken pog m8
intel >>>>>>>>>>
Holy price increases.
Well, understandable for 1080p but gaming at 2k or 4k won’t help you.
i will buy it,love
please stop letting engineers name your products
I'm waiting for R5 - 5600 ( 3600 successor)
Radeon 6000 certainly isnt as ground breaking as rtx 3000 performance wise, but if the price is right, this could be amazing.
@22:28 so wholesome!
Every time they say Gaming sip of water.
Amazing!
bye bye intel
big navi: releases nvidia: neh, outdated already  intel whatever lake: releases zen 3: neh, outdated already
The BigNavi announcement was more of a vaporware tease than the real deal. Hopefully next week it'll be more fun.
amd: breaks record amd 5 minutes later: *but wait! there's more!*
But can it run MSFS 2020? 🤣
Сравнить 5950 с i7 10... Это как сравнить ryzen 7 2700 с core i3
great job
danm expensive
Who wins? Microsoft or Sony?  Answer:  AMD
when you are the best, with whom do you compete? yourself.
19:02 New chips  19:36  Price and release date
So epic 😱
AMD ! good luck!!!
radeon : most powerful gaming GPU me : not most powerful editing GPU tho, no CUDA cores 😂
Nice I waited all that time waiting for better apu's for nothing ._.
When I grow up I will be a amd engineer I love computers I wish i could build my own pc with ryzen and ryzen gives the best performance.
hmmmmmm ... they didnt say if ryzen 5000 can be run with x470 b 450...
This is the year AMD takes over
Lol that 3% is like what 2-3 fps? 5 fps at most? Hahaha that's really negligible especially for 1 game and at a lower price. AMD will still take the W and my money on this one. I'd save that 100$ and buy a better GPU instead! AMD Numbawan!
Time for the TechTubers to change their bench PCs again! LOL!
bought an i5-4590 back in 2014, I cant wait to upgrade to a ryzen 5600x
Yeah team red ftw!
Me: saying something...  Also Me: Aren't well overdone Memes fun? 🤣  But seriously, Can't wait for the R7 5700X to be released.
U guys r great ! But plz fix it drivers !
POG CHAMP!
HAHA Love it, give the  finger to the competition!
yo I'm panic selling my 3950X
I figured it was gonna be good, but this actually far surpassed my expectations. Big navi not so much but it was only one slide. Hope to hear more from it soon.
Loved how they suppressed as well as showed what it truly looks like. You get more boost in performance on low res so they say 1080p at the end. Yes, I'm talking to those companies who brag about their "Huge Leap" over last zen and never tell the full story. Like what last zen, which product, what load.   And then again they show that -3% performance over other products. Truly hats off for their honesty.😍 Love you AMD.
And they used a Nvidia 2080 Ti in the benchmarks. LoL
I wander what her s gaming setup is like
What about ryzen 3??
Thank You!!!!
Okay but will they sell out in 5 seconds?
I could sample one
"Where gaming begins"... If you're a cheap entry level pc bastard with a tiny budget, you immediately get AMD because they are the only thing you can afford.
Remember, remember the fifth of november.
And who said Intel single core will always be ahead of AMD? Haha those days are closing in.
Where are your extra 5 fps now intelfanboys ?
I know a lot of people say Cinebench isn't a practical benchmark and that 'nobody uses Cinema4D' but more and more 3D animators are switching from Maya to Cinema4D. I use Cinema4D and prefer it to Maya, and so do all of the 3D/morgraph animators that I personally know.
this is insane!
Some shoplifter sold them all a pair of new shoes for this gig! :-)
I wanna lick it. Just me?
Will there be a "ryzen 5600"? Kinda to replace the 3600?
"Huge increase in gaming performance" 5600x for 300 dollars Ight imma head out
Intel: 😑...
Oh my god
They show video editing, rendering, cad, c++ compiling and gaming benchmarks. Intel : We need REAL WORLD benchmarks like SYSMARK.
300 dollars for r5? That so expensive. Let's hope the just a msrp and not a amazon price
This is great though the 10900k is $100ish less for somewhat similar gaming performance. For pure gaming builds, AMD still isn't the clear no doubt choice. For a mixed gaming/production build it definitely obviously is. If I were building a PC today I'd get it for my needs. Can't wait to see real world benchmarks. I'll be staying on my 3900X though.  Also looking forward to seeing the 5800X vs the 10900k. If they also win there in gaming then that would also be a very big deal for AMD.
welp, guess my 3600 is getting an upgrade to that sexy new 5800 or 5900 cpu
WE DID IT REDDIT
"Available" November 5th  I bet you will... I bet you will.
why does Lisa have 2 watches
rip intel
I love AMD chips. It has made gaming much better♥️
Stop its already dead.
RIP Intel
Where is the 5700X? or it got dumped for the 5800X and thats it?
Zen 2 cores: my cache Zen 3 cores: our cache
3600X ($250) vs 5600x ($300): 20% increased in price, 19% (hardly) gain in performance. No thanks, I will keep my 3600.
Love u amd
Intel: 14++++!   AMD: 7nm go brrrr
It's crazy that it's taken us 50 years of constant research and progress to get here but every year they add on 20% of all performance achieved in history. It's like everything we've done so far is nothing look 1 year and we do 20% extra.
AMD is killing it, you won me over.
Zen 3 is the core AMD has waited since K8... for 17 years.
X box using AMD PS5 using AMD PC using AMD Intel getting destroyed
Paper master more like nostril master. Sheesh that beak is huge and every inhale is picked up by that mic in HD audio lol
still cry with my fx 6300
👍🏾🥰😍🥰
me after I bought 3900xt knowing this was right around the corner :_(
Man I've been team blue since day one but damn these numbers look good
Maa vadu kousik gadu thopu bhavani nagar to us amd
I wished they named it 6000 series so everytime she says 5950x its 69 :/  Btw were is the bike tho
So... Any guesses how long until Threadripper???
ВСЕМ АМУДЕШНИКАМ ВСТАТЬ, ИГРАЕМ ГИМН АМУДЕ 2700 700 700
AMD : Here’s our new lineup with real innovation and higher performance at lower rates.  Intel  : wait this is illegal.
Mouth watering. I got my new monitor (LG 27gn950), now I just need a new CPU and GPU.  I am definitely going full AMD this time. Throw in a BE QUIET case and I am done. This is all for Cyberpunk 2077...num num num.
Hey could someone tell me if it’s worth waiting for these to come out or if I should just get a  3900x right now?
Why the price hike?  Congrats on finally beating Intel.
Big Navi is probably gonna release on black Friday
Zen 3 will have high single threaded performance? There will be no reason to buy Intel :D
disapointing, i wanted to see lisa with some dr. martens instead of these ....
AMD= Neo Intel with their overpriced cores= smith clones
price increase :(
Boom!
GG intel
I'm very disappointing by the Zen3 to Zen2 pricing tier compared to Zen2 to Zen+ price tiering. +$100 for +10- 19% SIngle thread performance, 19% IPC, and +10 - 15% Multi thread performance really disappointing looking from price to performance was realling hoping to buy 5800x for £350 - 375 at max instead its £400 at around the same u can get 3900x which leaves the ? to consumer more cores for programming or better low latency chips for gaming and lower core count for programming.
nvidia is still better
<3
Who else is waiting for Intel Coffin Lake?
Yep!
“We heard your challenge Intel” the entire Intel HQ just trembled
Not bad,not good,simply fine job.
I'm convinced Lisa Su and Jensen Huang are the same people cross-dressing. They are also in charge of the largest hacker/terrorist group on the planet and are building a time machine.    Prove me wrong.
as an enthusiast, want to do QEMU inside a vmWare linux machine... AMD-V/RVI, hopefully , seamless in the 3950X
filmmakers right now : a7s3 + new lenses VS upgrade to zen 3 + new RTX me : my wallet sad
Well i gueß that ends the discusion whos faster the argument that Intel is atleast faster in gaming is dead now
amd vs amd
Each gen of ryzen has risen
We can't even find Zen 2 based laptops, imagine when Zen 3 will appear on mobile...! Amazing job AMD!
Why isn't the 5800x given the best chips? why isn't that touted as the best gaming CPU? Wouldn't all the cores being on the same chip decrease latency and generally be better? What games really need more than 8 cores?? Is this because of the 10900k being 10 cores?
Intel is superior
poggers
all these do is hype up the community and get these assholes with bots to scalp them. please stop doing this.. just launch them with 0 hype and i promise u. gamers will buy and be able to buy. this marketing actually kills the market and pisses consumer off
ggwp AMD! 👍😉
price increases lol
so, umm.... what the hell wil the 5990X Threadripper be doing to benchmarks?! geez ~19% increased IPC?? damn!
No bike announcement? Cringe.
Best 24 mins of my life.
Intel be like: are maa chudi pade hai 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Idk why but I feel like big Navi isn’t gonna be as good as rtx 3000
i wonder aboute they have fix high temps if they dont have done it i will go back to intel
1080p! FFS put the damn thing under some real life conditions... 1080p, let me dust off my Windows 2000 CD.
If Su and Jensen had a baby it would be the chosen one of tech company CEOs
That prices though. Lets hope intel can save us next year. The price increase was just too crazy.
First I used to like intel I had intel 8th gen but I am shifting to amd
RTX 3080, at 4K Max: Borderlands 3: 60.8 Gears 5: 76
Yessss
Also, what happened to our promised retail, end user Zen 2 APUs!
I love being treated like a human and not like a cashcow
I look forward to hearing Intel telling me how much benchmarks don't matter anymore.
19:28 Pricing Info
Jesus Christ AMD you didn’t have to do Intel like that 🤣😂🤣
Nice one, AMD.
Just shiny Su.
Can anyone tell if any radeon gpu is equivalent to 3070 at cheaper should i buym
I'm a fan of AMD but its not that big of a win over intel. the performance is literally the performance difference of a 3080 and 3090. don't buy if you have a i9 10th gen, you wont see a difference in 20 to 40 fps when you're already gaming over 144+. you do you
23:34 BAD ass Quality ?? 😂😂💪❤
Just take my money 💰💰💰💰💰
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE USED TO SEE FROM YOU GUYS IN TERMS OF PRICING. Really considering going with intel
This is insane! 🔥
Remember remember the 5th of November
Lmao those high heels
It looks great
So why there is no 4000 series desktop processer
Comon 5900x 12 cores 105w 🤯 Intel room heater has left the building 😂😂😂
Respect... i couldnt take like that without people clapping sometimes ...
cringe
Intel staff disliked the video
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Hi, you show us 10900K not overclocked! It beats your CPUs when overclocked, sorry. And prices are way to high  Where is 5500X or 5400X? Where is CPUs for budget gaming like 149 and 199US?
5600x - three  hundred bucks 💵 🏳‍🌈
Mi b450 no la soporta cierto? Jaja me la compré esperando ryzen 4000
Also, props to AMD for not mentioning Intel specifically by name a single time. Stark contrast to Intel's mobile event a few weeks back where they said AMD and Ryzen twice as much as their own product names lol.
Who the fuk will buy 5900xt to play league of legends or cs go lmfao
I loved the presentation! Can't wait to get a 5800X.
I’m going with intel 10th gen. AMD is awful.
Lisa: welcome everyone, big welcome to all of you and thank you all for joining us today [ and a special welcome to all you Intel exects that im sure are sweating right about now ]. Intel exects:
nice work AMD!
Person : IM a Bluue team Also person : what is use of my existence
Intel’s done for.
great presentation
cool hopefully u can do something against botting idiots when the sales start
Welp... now I need to sell my 3950x for a 5950x!
For people who wanted an I9 10900k for your RTX 3080, you might want to reconsider for the 5900x for 5950x
Intel just shat their pants
AMD: "Great performance, faster than Intel and only 105W." Intel: releasing new 12-core CPU, 30% more expensive @200W+ and saying "It's unfair from AMD to use representative benchmarks."  xDDDDDDD
Lets see how RDNA 2 is!  First PC build in many years and either getting a 3080 or RADEON 6000 series to pair with the 5800X.
Can't wait for Ryzen 5000. I am still running a 5 year old 5820k at 4.5ghz. This is the first processor that has the performance uplift I am looking for to upgrade. Looks like Big Navi is going to be slightly slower than RTX 3080 in not RT titles. Curious to see how the RT implementation compares to Nvidia's.
AMD  ya just kicked Intel ass yet again  cant wait to get the new gpu
Well done, well done, well done.
Did anyone see how it lost 3% in battlefield V. How?
I don't like the pricing of ryzen 5 5600x pl😒😞
i was waiting for the next ryzen 3.. anyone?
AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD WOOO WOOO 🤩🆙👏👏
40 extra fames is insane its over for intel now
I Always been fan of AMD, both GPU and CPU. Thank you AMD! Thank you Lisa <3
Топ презентация
Intel just got murdered
Sorry intel, but its time pack your bags, sell your assets to amd and skip town my dudes lol
I am looking forward to seeing what happens and how Radeon 6000 series preforms. I hope it will be competitive with RTX3080/3090 or that tier. I also am wondering if the Ryzen 5000 will support DDR5.
Amd: *Makes 6 core $299, makes 8 core $120 more with 2 cores and .1mhz increase* Amd's socials: *insert dumpster fire gif*
You remember Intel?    Me neither...
👏
Hopefully the product line fills out quickly because that's quite a jump in price from the 6 core processor to the 8 core processor. Will be interesting to compare a 3700x vs the 5600x.
Whatever they're paying Robert Hallock, he deserves it. Extremely solid segment.
Top Perfromanse!

No budget cpus?
Big big announcement !
A bit confused by the mentioning of 5nm architecture being in development; not sure that was the best marketing strategy. Outside of that, looks promising. Bring on the benchmarks!
AMD YES！
Goosebumps 22:27
I'm waiting for the APUs for my budget pc build
368 intel fanboys/girls
Cant wait for 10900k vs 5600x in gaming.
That's it! AMD is gonna dominant the gaming industry, RIP Nvidia/Intel...
Best single thread and multi-thread performance  Intel: Mr.Bob Swan i dont feel so well
rip intel.
THE QUESTION IS WILL IT BE AVAILABLE!  CAN WE BUY IT?   OR WILL IT BE A DISASTERUS AS NVIDIAS
PRICES ARE BAD
All hail TeamRed.
YES PLEASE BIG NAVI
2016,2015 budget builders know... Had to go with fxs back then because intel was so expensive.  So happy they go down like this.
No massive collection of silicone spatulas? 🥺🥺🥺
NIce. on that note with stock settings, do you think Asus ROG Strix X570-I Gaming Mini ITX AM4 Motherboard can handle 5900X with be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4 50.5 CFM CPU Cooler?
HOLY SHI$ AMD JUST KILLED intel
FX 8350 is proud.
Im still using xeon 22nm,Damn. promise to buy  5950X next year.
Can’t  wait to see this on wan show later
Where my Fx gamers at!?
Expensive
*MY TIME HAS COME TO UPGRADE FROM MY I7-6700K*
Not impressed at all. Hoped AMD would push things way harder on their 'superior architecture'. Beating Intel by a bare minimum with this tech? Again, not impressed
I think AMD need to change their tag line to AMD the future is now.
Can we all just sit back and remember when AMD was laughed at and mocked. I’m happy for them. 😁
Meh, they increased the speed, but increased the price, too, so it is cancelled out. I will just keep using my Zen 2.
F's in the chat for Intel i9 10900K
OMG! That V-Ray render.
If I had a nickel for every time lisa said “games” or gaming...
i built my brother a 3950x pc. about a month ago, so safe to say we'd be upgrading his pc maybe next year. with zen 4, ddr5 tech. cant wait. i hope that last demo was with the low end card. otherwise thats really bad. 60fps what the hell. im not sure what frames i get but i run gears 5 on ultra with a rx 580. so 73fps is not impressive. (we called big navi because we are hoping and expect a major lead like the cpu has been) wheres the threadripper?
Rip Intel.
lame presentation
How powerful will Zen 3 be?  AMD: yes  How long till I can get my hands on one of these? Bots: no
так теперь бы еще и на русском это все)
Amd. Gaming dream of  poors
Prices are a bit high. Kinda disappointed.
Can't wajt for 14nm+++++++++++++++++++++++++😎😎😎😎😎 bigger is better😩😩😩
Why was fortnite not up there on the benchmarks
Dudes last name is PaperMaster. I thought maybe it would be some kind of weird spelling to look more like a name but no...  Its... Papermaster  Well last names originally derived from a profession, so he better have wicked origami skills or something
How cheap would a 10900k have to be before you would buy one now? $250?
Im happy that Amd created Ryzen i cant imagine a future without this competition between Intel and Amd with Intel barely changing something in their CPU's but since Ryzen was released even Intel waked up to do more in the end its a win / win for consumers to have more performance out of their PC's
فحوووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووووله
The Radeon 6900 sits midway between the 3070 and 3080 based on those numbers. If it's priced at $600 or under, AMD would have themselves a clear winner here.
If you guys were wondering, the Borderlands 3 FPS is 7fps below the RTX 3080, and the Modern Warfare FPS is 6FPS below the 3080.
Intel Jingle: Shits all inside!
24:27 the funny thing about the reference specs they used to compare the processors is that they used GTX 2080 TI for comparision rather than Radeon. They won one race but another one is still and won't be won anytime soon.
tremenda follada que le dio amd a intel
I just witnessed a murder
AMD FOR THE WIN!!!!!!
so uh... 3700x or 5600x 😅
Noice
AMD: Threadripper Intel: RIP-here
Lisa looks more and more like Ken kutaragis daughter every day
We just watched Intel's public execution.
No new Zen 3 APUs? I was hyped for those....
Damn dis is epic
Why they just increase all the prices of the  latest amd processors .
Rip intel 😁😂
Intel was superior in single core performance and now amd just blew them out of the water with more than enough power left over to do it again and again
Why is the 5600x $100 more than the 3600x? That completely shifts the price dynamic of the X600x series. Will the 5600 be considerably cheaper, or what?
You should make those boost clocks more doable guys because that stupid bump in performance for 100 dollars more is not wort it
AMD <3
Can't wait to see Big Navi and I'm rooting for AMD. I hope the RTX3080 does not benefit from the 5900 in the same way they showed earlier. Otherwise it is still not in the same league.
We’ll soon be seeing every tech reviewer using an AMD processor for GPU benchmarking. That is crazy to think about 🤯
The dislikes are from Intel users
I guess it would be available in 2021 instead of Nov 5th, just like Nvidia graphic cards.
17:31 -3% !! Unacceptable!
Lmao 12c/24 t and still so bad performance on cpu intensive games like battlefield V. It shows these new chips does not perform well specially when need (in cpu intensive games). All other games can be ran on potato but look at poor performance on such a high end game. Intel shines
What about Ryzen 3 5000 series?
Man at these prices I might have to jump to consoles.  Like for the price of a 5800X you can get a console with 8c/16t processor, 2070S equivalent GPU and a gen 4 1TB SSD wtf
RTX 3090 + i9-10900K.  Amd kill rtx 3090  Modern warfare average fps83 Big navi fps88
So emm desktop ryzen 4000 series?
Is Dr. Lisa Su Single ?
Good work AMD You have made high end processors affordable and accessible to the average person. Thank you!
What the frick amd 5 300 us dollar wtf
356 Intel fans just got butt hurt...
Disappointing overall (big price hikes), 5950x was the only thing that looked 'good'.
Intel in next presentation: Introducing Coffin Lake
No ryzen  5700x  entry level 8core budget cpu! Wish they brought one around 350usd mark ☹️
3950x will be mine!!! 105 watts CRZAYYY.. AMD for the win. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That 5950X pricing is making my heart flutter, I hope it's not a heart attack man.
Alguien latino
the prices tho :/
Now, if only I have money to build a PC....
"Where Gaming Begins" The affordability goes out of the window - AMD.  On a Serious note, a 100$ price hike ? Are you helping Intel to stay competitive or cashing in on loyal customers ?
Summary: LOOK AT ALL THESE PROCESSORS! CORE COUNTS! BOOST CLOCKS! AMAZING! And I guess theres also a graphics whatever, who cares
Does it run GW2?
Again the price is higher .... AMD ceases to be AMD. More and more it is INTEL red. Buy yourself at such prices.
nice
Meanwhile my specs   core 2 duo e7500 with GeForce 9400 GT 1 GB and 4 GB DDR2 RAM? Mobo dg41rq
Hello, 911? Yes, I'd like to report a murder!
HELL YEAH
$100 for 0.2GHz higher clock?? no 5600 or ryzen 3?? 3600 is good for me lol
Bruh jeans and heels  👠  lisa you my hero. She did a great job with the presentation
I love the setups for each chart at the end of the video - you guys have same levels of transparency and engineering! I would love if you can also become stronger in GPUs than nVidia for the first time in years.
We still need intel or the price will go higher. That is called competition it helps the consumers out alot
i have no idea how a CPU works but... WOOHOO! Better performance! could someone tell me how tho?
Why is there "Dr" behind her name? Does she operate on dead CPUs?
$300 for a 6core does anyone else feel that's a little high for an AMD CPU? the 3900x launched at $499 now the 5900x is launching at $549 has The Trade war with China and the United States AMD do not pull an Intel. Now I'm worried about the GPU pricing.
A! M! D! HARDER, FASTER BETTER!
Help Guys, what should I get?  Ryzen 7 3700x or Ryzen 5 5600X ?
My b550 has a new  processor coming.
I'm genuinely impressed !  Grats AMD ^^
What happened to the pricing?? 5800x looks pointless to me.
AMD: Why are you gae? Intel: Who says I'm gae? AMD: You are gae.
damn I'm in love with that  lady ❤️
where's epyc that competes with intel? Intel still holds server market. Would like to see some good alternatives
I'm currently watching this on my XPS 15 that has an intel processor...
Intel: wait for my 14nm+++++++++++ meteor lake on 2025
RIP INTEL LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
waiting for that big navi, zen 3 apu
FU Intel
What happened to 4000 series?
Госпаде, смотрел и плакал от радости, спасибо вам ребята за такие труды. Успехов всем вам.
❤️❤️❤️❤️ Ryzen
Lisa: I am *SILICON* man
They didn’t showcase the bike
16:40 Savage!
It’s official: Intel is to the PC market as Apple is to the phone market. You’re paying for the brand, not the best product.  AMD and Android are both priced fairly for their respective markets and actually perform the best.  The pirates of silicone valley have been overthrown at last
Hey stop cheating where is the 3300x
I am going to stay with my 2200g.😄
Guau, sayonara intel, wellcome AMD
ryzen 5000 series at my birthday! <3 i think my best friend is the 5600X
Damn she killed them
poggers
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Lisa snapped Intel thrice
buy them AMD stocks
wait no mention of infinite cache??
I love how she's wearing The thinnest High-Heels. Perfect for kicking Intel's Ass
zen 4 5nm ...Mind Blown...
Me watching at an Intel Pentium IV CPU *cool stuff*
AMD should know by now that Intel makes better presentations for AMD products ^^. All jokes aside, absolutely LOVE AMD. Without them Intel and Nvidia would eat us alive
Congratulations for all workers from AMD. Beatiful Job!
Waiting for more ++ from team blue😁
Dammit Lisa keeping the suspense on their next gen bicycles...
I love you AMD
Intel: Well... We're still faster on Battlefield V!
Those 300 plus dislikes are all from intel employees. Rofl!🤣
is it just me or anyone else saw a higher single thread performance score?
intel is crying at the corner
That was EPYC 🤣
clock speed still lower than 10900k, really?
Where is the budget friendly Savior AMD???
can't wait to see Linus's Video
Hype
glad i waited, zen 3 and big navi come to papa
I m here after watching new video of  "MRWHOSETHEBOSS".😂😂😂
Awesome :)  I would love to see a threadripper Chip with ZEN3, I would buy it instantly :D
LISA SUU IS A MADLAD!!!!! SHE HAD SOO MUCH FUN KILLING INTEL
These are being released well after Intel chips, they supposed to be better. duh
This was some short event
-$100 and I will buy a 5900x. I'm returning my new x570 board until then .
Fps performance gain in 1080p gaming does not translate to the same performance gain in 1440p or 2160p gaming.
Intel fanboys watching in tears
WHEN WILL YOU START THE RX 5700 PRODUCTION?
mkbhd: so i have used this for a week ...
ffs to much money
Ryzens are the future processors. People will hardly know intel later.
Congratulations for taking the crown amd.  Youre now the undeniable indursty leader in Cpu performance.  But need to be honest here. The 5800x seems a bit overpriced. All of them a bit actually. While the leap is significant , it alles comes at a hefty price up: 300 dollars for a 6 core while you got a prev. Gen 8 core for 330 when it came out? And now, currently your only new gen 8 core comes in a 450$, so a +150$ for a 2 core leap?  To this seems you wanr to push us more to the even more expensive 5900x. Where you get another 4 cores for just 100$ more. So 8 vs 6  cores is 33% more  cpu power but the cost is increased by 50%! In the 5800x vs the 5600x.  While the 5900x has 50% more cores than the 5800x, for which the price comes in at 22% higher. Makes the 5800x kind of an  irrelevant cpu in my taste, because it was most likely to become my new cpu. Add to that it has an even lower rated clock boost.  This pushes me more into the 5900x and i dont like it one bit.  Now im even tempted to wait for another gen for ddr5 and next gen cpu and see what intel might have for us once they finally can get a smaller  process to work.
WEll done, keep it up
Intel gatta fuk Raha haa
Gimme!
Finally 3600 cpu & 5600 gpu price will fall and i can use the money my ass saving for years to build a new pc
Lisa su: .....and mobile..... Me: don't give me hope
Its Big Navi now, we won the battle.
:3
Crying in Corner... 5600x will be launched at $350+ in India as usual ....
bait for wenchmarks
Take my money AMD.....
The tide has turned. Ryzen is now undoubtedly the leader in gaming... Exciting times for tech enthusiasts and the average consumer alike.
Dad, Why is my sister's name Rose?  Because your mother  loves Roses!  Thanks Dad!  No problem   Ryzen 5950x
When a new threadriper will be announced? Anyone knows ?
Should be titled “AMD humiliates Intel for 25 minutes”  Looking forward to the RDNA2 release.
Intel Sweating in the back as AMD Shreds competition.
Intel: write that down, write that down
If I pause the video at around 14:40 a few times, I see more like 10% difference, than the announced 28% :/
Linus is going to start loving AMD more now
ура заебись
I hope 5000 series is compatible with my motherboard....
always be with
love you amd
DR. Lisa Su gets more Credit. She's a Doctor!
I know i can't buy any of these but it still feels great when amd takes down intel in everything.
Soy usuario Intel, pero Lisa se lució esta vez...
Guess is time to upgrade both the CPU and GPU.
сраный гугл выдаёт не хотел давать мне ссылку на официальный канал amd
Nice, I'm still very happy with my 10900K :)
too expensive
Depends on the price and performance. Until now Intel CPU's have generally few more avg. fps and uses the system RAM and VRAM more efficently. For Gaming, Intel wins for me, AMD CPU's are better at rendering etc. But avarage person is gonna game more than render more. So im just waiting for benchmarks. But i still expect intel to win ever so slighlty.
I can't believe, this is victory.
No APU :(
No ryzen 3 5000 ☹
16:43 MP Ratio 12,96
To be fair, I'm almost certain that when Rocket Lake launches early next year, it will almost certainly edge AMD out by at least a few percent in all those benchmarks. BUT, this is pretty damn impressive. When you factor in AMD competes at a better price to performance ratio than intel, and they are offering a nearly identical performance...damn man. I hope they keep this up. I'm planning to upgrade from my 6700k next year and I've been looking at Ryzen for a long time. An overclocked Ryzen chip is looking pretty tasty right now.
And they still have XT models to release next year
Whoever else is waiting for a cheap series release
I am upgrading in 2025. Seeing the advancement year over year makes me salivate. I can't wrap my head around using a 5nm CPU by that time!
Gotta love that -3% and tied results.. love the transparency
AMD fan, but still waiting for a core clock of 4.0 GHz CPU to arrive.
Intel: My time has come
Go on amd loving it tho I had hoped that you might have hit the 5 GHz overclock mark
Intel punching the air rn
I just hope they'd have released it under 4000 series itself and not pointlessly make it more confusing by 5000 series. Rest intel's funeral it is regardless of naming.
Let's see the prices in EU...
mark looks like he's simulated lol
Wanna bet who has higher number? AMD: $549 Intel: yeah we double the price
Amd is bestest ❤️🙈
Big Navi can compete: 73 FPS on Gears 5 vs. 76 FPS on 3080. What should be the price?
Lol ..they didn't even bother to show multi thread cinebench score .... I mean ..it's obvious...but that was just so perfect 👌
Wtf pricing lol
Ha! you want some true CPU torture game benchmark? try late-game Stellaris!
The only Asian Mom we hoped for.
Amd is hot..yeah burn your pc
Amd amd fiyatları biraz daha düşür ekonomi iyi değil yeni nesil bir pc toplamak istiyorum ✌️😔
Intel: no man can defeat me !   Lisa su : i am no man , I am woman.
what about x670 mobos?
i really want a 5950x, it's just incredible
I would guess a lot of their sales may come from people who couldn't secure a PS5, XSX and/or RTX3080. So yeah... looks like you win my money this time, AMD!
Intel should just do a thermal paste business for AMD at this point
AMD: We now have the best Gaming CPU  Intel: Hold my beer... I have to change my underpants.
Intel what's up with you
longest diss track video ever
22:40 Team Rocket Big Navi
I love the honest benchmarks, transparency is beautiful
too expensive, sorry.
No APUs?
24:28 graphics card - rtx 2080 ti
Rip Budget Gamers And Specially those Budget guys who waited for 4-5 months For Zen 3       Again RiP
No 5700x? Increased the price?  Looks like a I have to go plan B. and buy a cheap 3700x 2nd hand from a early adopter when Zen 3 launches.
Intel after watching this  Try our 12th gen processor 0.01% improvement than before
lmao the amd fanboys from comments xd
So will this work on zen 3 motherboards?
The big question is: Can it run Crysis?
Big NAVI fps benchmarks: 23:15
Where is BitWIt and Paul's Hardware!?!?
press F for Intel
AMD MASTER RACE <3
damm they even beat intel in single core.. that's insane.. hats off AMD Team.
I can finally afford the Ryzen 2000 series
is this AMDs killshot?
High Heels and Jeans?
RIP Intel
Im just here waiting for ryzen 3 5100
I can imagine, that Lisa throws the Intel cpu in the trash then spits on it after the benchmarks
AMD, please take my money :D I need it for development though.
Лучше бы назвали RYZEN 4XXX
61 fps :(
F for Intel
Who else can't afford any of these?😂
Shows you who is in the lead when all you talk about is how good you are. The others however , could not stop talking about you in there last presentation .
I can see AMD dominating Intel financially someday at this rate.
Надо было учить английский а то нихуйя не понял
The guys at AMD can paint a killer circle!
Im just here for the APU
Intel prices
I'm happy.... My Upgrade from 1600 to 5600x... AMAZING AMD
Not fair.. 06:49 i just saw Tim Cook + Jeff Bezos in fusion.. This Why AMD so "High"
Great new Zen 3 architecture CPU and Radeon 6000 series 👍👏👏 bUT...      Can it run Crisis?
Looks like prices are higher than the equivalent previous gen launch, right?
the prices are a little bit disappointing.
Gpu is DOA. But the cpus.... well played. Let’s see you win
16:48 lol they missed the multi core ration of 12.91 -> Cine bench multi for the 5900x: 8146
Look at their effort to bring benchmark comparison as equal as possible by using the exact same RAM kit.
GG Amd! Can't wait to see what to choose betwen the rtx 3060 or the NAVI 2 gpu's. Hopefully it will be good or better performance at the same or even less price!
AMD & GIGABYTE Best
At this point they should really just rename to Su Computing
I love intel always , no  matter AMD Wins
AMD YES！
yep intel is just null and void now
psst that gcard running the Shadow of the tomb is the new 6900xt lol
Dr.Lisa: We destroy intel on work loads.  Me: Obviously  Dr.Lisa: We also beat them in gaming. Me: Well thats actually impressive Dr.Lisa: This is big navi Me: Yea goodluck with that one.
Hm, i thought r5 5600x would be cheeper...
AMD Fan = 1 Like
Pek ürünün arkasında  durmuyor lar  garanti konusunda sıkıntılı   coğu kişi sıkıntı yaşarsın   sorun  cıkar sa  direk değiştirmiyor. Diyorlar  bilgisayarcılar  sorunlu diyor.
$300 for a 6 core ummmmmm no thanks
uh oh  no 1440p performance mentions, are we going to get another letdown like the 3080?
AMD, yes!!!
Disappointed by the 11% price increase. Was expecting similar prices to Zen 2. A 5600 processor for 300$ is way too much while 3600 sells for 200$. 250$ would be reasonable. 300$ is too much for entry level processors. Especially since there are no benchmarks yet to compare Zen 3 processors vs Intel counterparts.
AMD 🥰🥰😍😍😍🤪😘🤩🤩🤩
Intel is late for the party, and AMD knows it, thus the prices they are shooting now...
R.I.P
AMD don't be like Intel. Price hike is really disappointing.
Everyone needs to stop bitching about the prices. These are brand new tech, expect to pay top dollar. That’s how it’s always been. Idk why y’all need to be complaining. The price aren’t too insane for what you get with brand new tech.
Really wanted to see the 5800x
Excelente!
I was expecting "Avengers: End Game" background music.  But sadly didn't come up.
Best in gaming????  Right. 😂🤣😂🤣 you compete with intel in gaming when can actually hit 5.0ghz.
Fan boy of AMD from my first 90mh k5 procesor 23 years ago, so proud AMD put Intel to shame now☺
Fake Feminists - placard, yelling, chanting ! Real Deal, Liza decimating Intel (gives feminists a reality check !) Fake Feminists - still yelling. While Liza, still continues decimating Intel !
PaperMaster and his nose breathing freaking me out, making it hard to breathe
IM HYPED
Intel : we made Iris plus  AMD : nice  08 October 2020 ~ Intel : ........
I had to use samsung tablet to post this as my intel pc died after witnessing AMD Ryzen 3 crush intel next gen.
what a time to be alive
Even AMD couldn't get a 3080 to test
Can we talk about rx6000 series? Imagine performance shown are from middle end(price equals to gtx3070) card from AMD
Sony & Microsoft: Haha, we killed pc gaming. Nvidia: Hold my RTX 3000 intel: Hold my Tiger Lake AMD: OK guys, hold my Zen3.
AMD All the Way <3 !!! like if you agree .
No 5700x at $375 ish? I’m surprised.
Amd is killing already the dead here.
My cat killed my 4k computer so I Shevardnadze to rebuild it, I’m so glad I didn’t purchase a 3900x but I have to wait a full month without a computer :(
Please fix Papermaster's nose.
Will the be sold out instantly though?
The performance uplift is good but so is the pricing. I own a 3700x. Comparing the pricing in a Ryzen 7 level processor, this seems costly.  Ofcourse, AMD deserves to make profits, but this is a little letdown.  With proper (aggressive) pricing, on both CPU & GPU, people would have easily upgraded. AMD should consider there pricing, considering this time, it's not just the CPU but winner GPU as well.
The
5600x and 6600xt will be my next pc
Амудэ тащит!!!! One love❤️❤️❤️
coo
Announcer : Finish Him Amd : *beats intel in gaming and single core performance  Intel : *DIES IN 300 WATTS* Announcer : FATALITY
epic price) 5600 300$)) he he he... 10700 320-330$ wins)))
Thanks you very much Lisa su
When I have kids I will tell them of the great uprising of AMD.
AMD YES！
Ryzen 5950x period she's killing it.
Intel users.....lol feels bad. F
There's no 5300x ?? 😢
Amd love budget... But what the... They now out of budget 😑
Im upset about the prices Miss Lisa Su, i have a 2700x and a 3600 machine. I was ready to upgrade the 2700x to the new 8 core but when you mentioned the price, i found some instant appreciation for my 2700x, $300 and it would have been your most purchased product ever. Congratulations to the team, they finally did it, the performance is amazing.
cant wait for some press release from intel "bla bla real world" or like another cancer lake in 14nm
A bit too high prices
hope the price is right, coz in my country it could be 10% increase
Intel: left the chat room..
Ryzen 3?
With these high prices i think i'm just save for another 6 months and get rocketlake :-/ Oh well, guess they have the privilege to price it what they want. No doubt the CPU's are great, it is just priced too high considering the lead is so small for me. Edit: Speaking specifically about the price for the 3800x here
Waiting for TR 5990x
wait a minute 17:34 the battlefield one dropped to -3%
Can big navi beat Nvidia this time?
november 5th is my birthday, just saying
210w for the win?
I was here
Just incredible.
I was waiting for this
I'm one among many that dream to have a computer that powerful
I scored 600 on cinebench with my fx 4300?????? Edit: lol nvm I used all four cores for the test
Amd: Brags about 60fps 4k Nvidia: Brags about 60fps 8k
If you take AMD and change the A with the M then you get MAD Performance.
Almost +20% IPC, faster clock speed, but $50 starting price increase against similar Ryzen 3000 line CPUs (e.g. 3600X was $249, 5600X is $299, 3800X was $399, 5800X is $449, 3900X was $499, and 5900X is $549). I guess that means these CPUs are finally ahead of the competition and these are no longer just "best desktop CPUs except for games" but rather simply "best desktop CPUs". Now it's up to the pricing and availability. 3900X was so scarce that I was unable to get it for a few months (and it's still quite overpriced) so I ended up with 3700X. Now I'm considering 5900X—thankfully, it's just an in-socket upgrade so I can keep the motherboard. The biggest problem is that I'm already pretty satisfied with 3700X! :-)
AMD！YES！
I want !
mom please don't yell at me.
um..borderlands 3???
is the 5800x better than the ryzen 9 3900x?
AMD just tore Intel a new A-hole.
so nobody is going to talk about that BIG NAVI reveal?
I feel prices are not that aggressive  Intel has to do something with pricing like nvidia
Wish they would focus on an apu that is capable of 1080p 100+ fps gaming, also a new am1 cpu
Oh my..
AMD ♦️
I do 3d processing, photogammetry, run my 3d printers, and game with my pc. I can not wait to upgrade my 2600x with a 5900x <3
.............. And intel is officially  dead in the water
does anyone else feel the ryzen logo animation is very similar to god of war ragnarok <.< wonder if that game will be used to show off the capabilities soon
Xbox Series X vs PS5  Winner: AMD
wish these could have made into the consoles, maybe in the mid gen refreshes if compatibility isn't an issue?
boooooooooo too expensive! are u gonna rename yourselves to intel now?
Will the 5000 series support the x470 boards I wonder. 🤔
*17:29** battlefield V -3% ?*
5900x too expensive for “gamers” Most people want cheap and affordable CPU like Ryzen 5 but $299 hmm they better be faster then 10600k.
yes this is what i was waiting everyone rply for your thoughts
Amd🙂🙂🙂
I'm happy with my 3600, cooling that 5950X will be tough
Amd is the best
sad, still using i7 4770 😢
😁
RIP: Coffin-Lake
killed intel and nvidia xD
The question is what's intels CEO and engineering team doing after this 😂😂😂😂😂
AMD Yes. Great!!!
AMD is king
RIP INTEL
Hooooohoooooooooo!!
I love my 3900x
AMD YES！！！
Would have been nice to see a good sub $300 budget cpu here. I imagine that is absent because of pressure from Sony and Microsoft so they can still own the entry level gaming market. I expect the refresh will either drop prices or have new tiers introduced after initial console sales run their course.
Intel ded
I heard gaming * 100
This was awesome.
Ryzen 7 3700x m coming😂
Fun times @ Intel
Now i love 2020... thank you AMD❤❤❤❤❤
nice
Pmsl ..... thats it lol   I was hoping you would actually do it but once again intel wins and so does nvidia .
For 2 3 years ultimate pc
Remember remember, the 5th of November...
Come on the pricing man the 3600x @300$ that's way too over the line
well i expexted more
What about boards? I want It on my x370 -_-
what if this presentation was in front of green screen and the lights was calculated realtime with new radeon cards okay possibly is not true, but it's a really nice idea :D
5600x now: $299 1 years later: $199
Me upgrading from an fx processor: hmm maybe
طيب و r5 5400g💔
24:28 NVIDIA RTX2080 TI
Pricing seems a bit weird: you pay 150$ for an additional 2 cores and then 100$ for the next 4 cores. just judging by that the 5800x seems overpriced in comparison to the rest. My best guess it has something to do with all 8 cores being on the same die and the 5900x consisting of two dies with 6 cores each. So the yields might be better for the 6 core dies. Also 5900x offers the best price per cpu core which is kind of interesting.
Great news!
24:28 NVIDIA RTX2080 TI
so many intel fanboys in chat
cant wait to buy 5950x and then oc to 5.1ghz seems legit
Next year: Rip last year's AMD.
I am hyped! Can't wait AMD is killing it
@24:28 NVIDIA RTX2080 TI
Lol even Lisa got the XBox naming scheme muddled up a bit.
AMD++
300 USD for 5600x T_T
Worth sending back a recently purchased 3900x for the 5900x? £40-50 more? that is the real question. Will this be a repeat of sold out stock like Nvidia
Ryzen is op(over powered & over priced) 😁😁😂😂😂
Hopefully intel saves us on pricing! Go Intel! the new underdogs
Where's the zen 3 laptop?
Dam if the 5950x has good OC and better gaming performance on all Resolutions then I may move to team red.  Good work  AMD you clearly are listening.
this gen will use AM4 socket, right?
will there be a regular 5600?
will it be compatible in B450 boards?
Having AMD destroy intel has made my year significantly better
How have you gone minus for battlefield 5...well done amd. You've not only beaten Intel into the ground but shot your own pinky toe.
Ryzen 9 5900x release: Now I can finally go for ryzen 5
AMD AMD AMD
Gotta give it to AMD.  Converted me and as not let me down.  Intel was a bully who got their nose busted in 2018 now amd just double tapped them.
Tnx to AMD! Now we can game on a very strict budget Edit: Good Job in power efficiency in CPU also work in GPU and AmD is the best
Which is better (price to performance)? 3900XT or 5800X or 5900X
umm... new socket?
Well i don't know about processor but they give us new toung twister ryzen new gen zen processor
Dr. Su is best waifu. fite me.
I hope this wont be a paper launch
Basically amd is taking intel's place in their new ryzen gen
The prices are so expensive we need to back intel very stronge 😥
i am like thissss close to upload this to pornhub, under the "hardcore" category lol intel got fkn served, omg
Epic. Can't wait to see some Blender benchmarks!
That 8 core pricing is a hard kick in the balls.
intel be crying in 14 nm
wait another year and you will get the 5900X under $400
Finally amd f***ed intel lol :D
they should have made a ryzen 3 5100
Me: plans to buy a AMD 3500X with a B450 motherboard this video: dodge the bullet
LOL, intel is wrecking AMD     in a paralel universe
Drinking Game: Drink a sip every time one of the comments says intel
Poor intel.
2080ti Buyers: Why, Just Why i9 10k Buyers: I fell you m8
I have a 3800X and I'm NGL... Probably will upgrade! These are some tasty Nuggets!!!
46% improvement in CS:GO ??? and I was here with a 8700k@5.1GHz thinking 250fps was cool...
After hearing the price of ryzen 5 5600x and performance of ryzen 9 5900x I want to sell my kidney
Every body shout: AMD, YES!
Where are the None-X CPU parts?! I disagree with the prices! I will continue to recommend Ryzen 3000 parts until the prices are getting back to at least Ryzen 3000 SKUs :-( I will keep my Ryzen 5 3600 and skip the Ryzen 5000 series. I hope prices decrease very soon :-/
waiting for amd new gpu!!
AMD, please change your channel settings to allow more than one liner comments. It filters any length out.
So when can I actually get a 3300x?  I've had multiple stock notification requests in for months and no one has had any stock, except Israelis Koreans and Chinese on ebay, at 190% of retail..?????
Still not the fastest... unreal
wow im the 120,000 viewer....
AMD is the new Intel
I love Ryzen
And just like that, Intel was no more !
I wanna hug Lisa, I bet she smells good
Radeon, i need to see what it does in 1440p....
упоротая презентация
keep up the good work AMD!
Hmmm, No 5200G today.
AMD: Sets new Cinebench record Also AMD but 5 minutes later: Breaks current record
will wait for ryzen 'without X'🙃
I'm a huge intel fanboy but rip intel lmao
pce intel
Lol only +5-7% in games. Nvidia did +100% with their video cards. Give us more powerful processors!!!
-3% for Battlefield V? Maybe the Verge can do a follow-up video to get that back.
I/O die is 7nm ?
And that's how you present your products  amazingly without wasting 2hrs like certain other company that just hides their flaws.
Sabko thaa RYZEN par barosha lakin INTEL ki ma ka Bhosd@  Rip INTEL🙏🙏 Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Indians like here👍👍👇👇
in teory 5800x have to be faster in gaming thx to one cxx
So amd is going to beat intel for what? a month or few... but it seems that the big navi is not capable of beating nvidia's lineup... or even match :( btw why only test games like that, can't they get a deal with games like cyberpunk and the new cold war cod cause those titles matter and not the titles that have been out there for more than a year orso... also expected more flair from this event, so i think they should look more closely on how Apple and Nvidia are doing these events.
The only people to dislike this is harcore Intel/nvidia enthusiast´s lmao
intel fanboys be like : dislike
Very nice. Fastest is a good start, particularly vray rendering was a savage 59% beat over intel 10900 but I would have liked to see the clocks touch 5 or above, just for pyschology :)
$600 cad for the 5800x......welp
This ppl forced intel to give i3 10th gen 4 cores and 8 threads and 8c 16t on i7 10th, without these guys intel 10th gen i7 10070k would be 6c6t, and ppl would be paying 700$+ for that shyt, and yeah amd also a reason why now f and kf series cpus exist in intel
I am using the 2700X and 1080 Ti. I think it's time to upgrade the CPU & GPU and go for team RED on both of the components. I am just happy to see AMD bringing competition to both Intel and NVIDIA. If it wasn't for Ryzen, we would still be paying 400$ for a 4C/8T CPU with marginal gains form previous generations. And if Big Navi didn't existed, we would have probably seen a huge price hike on RTX 3000 Series GPU.  THANK YOU LISA SU!! THANK YOU AMD!!
LOVE AMD GG ❤❤❤
Good job Lisa is not doing the Ryzen unveil from her kitchen table.
OMG 348 PEOPLE ARE STILL ON INTEL!!!!!!
mama SU just sent Intel to bed without supper
Just take my money already...
Exactly 120k views lol
The Big Navi
4K benchmarks  Gears 5 - 3080 80 fps RX 6000 73 Modern Warfare - 3080 85 fps RX 6000 88 FPS Borderlands 3 - 3080 65 RX 6000 61  they can price at 3080 but If they price this at slightly less than 3080 so $700 or 650$ should do better as it will have a smaller power draw (as it's much more efficient), more memory and the radeon software and features are much better than nvidias.
The grave of intel!
And they said higher core count will bottle neck the gpu...
​What about Ryzen 3 5xxx? Looks like we forgot something here... In India, these processors will be overpriced asf. a r5 3600 costs 300 USD. You could get a 3700x for that price elsewhere like in the US. So even if I have a budget for a mid-end processor I will only find the Budget processors. A 3100 costs 100 USD and a 3300x costs 200. What I'm trying to say is that only budget processors are even close to reasonable in pricing and would have really liked a 5300. Maybe its gonna be launched next year? Either way, I just got a 4600h 1650 ASUS Tuf, and its amazing for the price (850 $, but the cheapest 4000 series laptop with dGPU that I could find in India)!
Imagine the technology that we will have 100 years from now. Maybe Elon Musk was right, we are living in a simulation
R.I.P Intel
if you do the math based one the games they show its actually an average of 6.8% increase in performance, not 26%........ but hey whos counting right?
What will be the price of 5900x in India
Well given the cost. I'll be waiting to see how the 5600 matches the 3700x
Gotta love the aggressively competitive, gamer focused vibe of this talk. Great job!
Amd is fear to show the performance fps of radeon 6000 series lol.. Surely the highest 6000 is below than Nvidia 3080
Intel: I'll compete with AMD AMD: I'll also compete with AMD
Then zen it shall be
but the real question should be asked, is both the Processor and the GPU going to be a paper launch like the RTX 3000 series, or are we actually going to be able to get our hands on these without CRAZY back order times. This was the main reason I am waiting for the AMD GPU announcement since you still can't get 3080, i doubt the 3070 launch will be any better, if AMD can deliver to the new Radeon, AMD will have my money.
Zen, you are what the computing world needed.
"hey whats ur cpu?" "5600" "what about gpu" "5600" "uhhh"
0:20 is this intentional or did u screw this up
I was excited and happy until i saw that 5600X will still be only 3.7Ghz base clock...
Where is her leather jacket?
Honestly, this isn't as impressive as I imagined.
AMD Beats Intel Again And Again. They already beat intel in multi core. And Now They beat Intel in Single Core
300+ intel fans pressed dislike
真香
Oo
Thank you AMD for giving me something to be excited about in this wacko year. Just please don't turn evil with your new found power. :D
So TLDR:  • 19% IPC increase and $50 increase for all CPUs across the board • 5900x is the first to hit 600+ points in cinebench • Basically makes intel irrelevant for both price and performance • Nov 5 release • 400 series mobos won't get the required BIOS to support Zen 3 until Jan 2021 • no bike announcement
Rip My Wallet
oh hell yea
"Gaming starts with AMD"  G: am i a joke to you
Even if the 5600X gives you let's say 20% more frames over the 3600, it costs $300, making it the same price as the 3700XT. If I can get the 3600 for $170 now, I think that's still a better deal. no?
Thank you AMD
Thread ripper Lalalala Halajala   Idk i just wanted to comment under this vid within the first 43 mins
LOVE YOU AMD! Seriously.
AMD USERS LIKE HERE.
Dislikers are paid by intel
intel：I have no toothpaste to squeeze out ToT
Xbox series X2 better have ZEN 3
well bois we did it, intel is no more
Are we really not gonna talk ablut that price bump??
BASSARDS !! ... WHERE IS MY NEXT-GEN, DESKTOP APU ?!
Overpriced on all Models save for the 5950X. Simply put you barely have a edge on Intel (on paper) but you are lacking Integrated Graphics at those prices. If it had Integrated Graphics then that value could more easily be justified, but as it stands looks like I will be going back to Intel until you sort your pricing. I realize that AMD is not a charity, but if you had been $50-75 cheaper across the board you would have acquired a definitive market share. But as it stands... you are going to have a lot of people waiting until you drop those prices or offer more substantial value.
What about 5100
Why not 5??? Lol
So it's... slower than the RTX3080? :(
Impressive. RIP Intel.
i like it but the price :/
Cool. I might  buy them in 2050 probably :)
All my intel fan boys friends were talking and i showed them this.
AMD is spawn killing intel not fair

S2. Nice
me laughing on my ryzen 1400. still fine in games. :D
whats more epic if i can a afford a  threadripper
Hello guys, I used to be an Intel fanboy but I decided to join AMD today, can you guys welcome me?
Going from 1. gen Ryzen 1700 to a 5900X. So excited
They really just bashed intel💀
the prices are crap. what the hell AMD from 6 to 8 cores 150$ and from 8 to 12 100$ what crap is this
Congratulations AMD! Very nice comeback. Looking forward to the Big Navi reveal!
Don't worry guys, the Ryzen 5 5600 (non x) will be priced at $250 and will give atmost same performance and maybe even better tdp than the 5600x so chillllllllll. and yes very hyped about high single core performance!!! and upgrading from 3600 to 5600 is would be great even if it is same cores and threads but because of the average 19% ipc increase and architectural changes, we will be getting close to 3700x multicore performance and 10900k single core performance
Does anyone remember the people who bought a Ryzen 9 3900X and a rtx 2080ti  These people today are crying their pants OF
LOL my 10900K @ 5.3Ghz and RTX 3090 gets 150FPS @ 4K in both those games at the end. WOW, this new AMD stuff is not that great. No thanks, I'll pass.
Sad Panda.  I was hoping to see 4 GHz base clocks by now.  Also, what happened to the 65W parts?  Hopefully with RDNA2, you introduce a 75W part that doesn't require a power connector but is still faster than Nvidia's 1650 series.
RIP INTEL 😂
Take a shot everytime she says gaming
rip intel
Intel presentation: mentions AMD 800x times AMD presentation: Intel who?
Linus tech tip waiting for your review
AMD ROCKZ
Me: "AMD SAID GAMING OOOMMMGGG"
Where is the leather jacket?
The sort of people that bought the 2080ti will buy Ryzen 3. Then get the piss taken out of them in 1 or 2 years.
Papermaster looks like a former Apple employee. Talks like one too.  AMD: We know you'll wait for benchmarks. We're still better so we don't mind.  Did they retire the x700X processors?
So you guys have one month to come up with 750 bucks Also Madam Su holds the big Navi with one hand! I don't know if you can do that with rtx 3080 🤣
.....how much
The real question is will they have stock??????
For AMD to say outright that they have "the best single core performance" I think means that they are really confident about just how good the performance on ryzen 5000 will be.
They showing the gpu’s also or another event?
Great job AMD! Having flashbacks of the Athlon / Pentium days at the turn of the century.
Was expecting a price increase, but not by that much for the 8 core. Guess its back to bread and jam until I can afford it!
Im lateeeeeeee
4.9 GHZ, AMD common you can do better, we need to break the 5GHZ
Please for the love of the stars and all the isnt Jedi, Please prevent scalping on these!!?
Lol, poor Navi, not even 5mins.
Carbon dioxide
24:27 graphics: Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti ..... Ouch
RIP INTEL
amd win!!
Su Bae brings the heat yet again! 🔥
Why not 5.00 GHz, I mean Intel has a boost of 5.3, 0.4 GHz more than the 4.9 GHz of R9-5950X. And still intel has to say a <<lower>> gen cpu if we count that ZEN 3 is better and newer than 10th gen Intels Core CPUs. But still R9-5950X will be my next CPU upgrade right now cuz it’s still powerful af.
Battlefield V -3% XD
Amd = new Intel. Expensive products and rabid fanboyism. Must be stopped
Single-Core champ AGAIN?!?!?!?!?! My Athlon 64 FX-57 (running right now) salutes you!!!!
AMD the company with honest presentations (-3%)
Watching this on my 2700X.
Zen 3 APU‘s PLEAAAAAAASSEEEE!!
price are not good i hate you amd last 3 generation price are good but now it's not worth
looking forward to build finally my first AMD only PC
I like that woman....She is a legend....
You could say that Intel are going to be... *inconsolable.*
And now consoles are trash before even launch
Lisa look like my grandma
everyone loves Lisa Su
*Ryzen has entered the chat*
Intel : press F to pay respect
🌚
У меня 10600к с куллером стоит столько же👌
Wish they'd bring in SMT4, that'd be a game changer
300 for the 5600X Lmao, I'll stick with my 3600 bruh
Intel getting no way.
299 dolars very expensive really
WHAT A HIGH PRICE
Guys come on slow, Intel is trying to come back this is not fair 😂
Holy balls.
I bought Ryzen 7 3800x 2 months ago for same price as 5800x is🙃
Intel just got tested positive for Covid-19.
Intel has fallen. Amd has ryzen       (This is copied comment but wanted to share something)
okay but home girl gotta stop wearing them high heels with those pants for real for real
I've been buying AMD because intel has been so overpriced for years.
I am more interested in the "5nm in design" ...
蘇媽，I LOVE U！！！
RIP AMD
lol everyone thought amd is some kinda charity, they charged just like INTELS lol. Guess I'll go back to intel for stability, new ryzen aren't that much faster
RIP Intel...
GOOOOOOOO!!! RYZEN!!
In micheal reevs accent: WHO COULD HACE SEEN THIS COMMING
They price their CPU as much as intel now. They're not the cheap choice anymore.
320 интелбоев вошли в чат
so much ray tracing on the stage ...
Intel: Dead Inside.
In the name of the father son and the holy spirit god, please rest Intel's soul in peace ☮️
AMD ❤️
Okay, granted AMD is delivering in the performance fields, but in a depression as we re all in, these prices... OMG! THESE PRICES!
Lisa Su with the bling on both arms
perfect timing to make it into my new build.. but RIP intel? lulz, business still dont trust AMD, especially in the Datacenter. Intel does need to freaking step up, but rumors of their demise are greatly exaggerated. 5800X paired with a RTX 3080 cant freaking wait
Damn, intel is already dead please stop
Coffin dance , Inside= intel 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ура, дождались))
Going to buy ryzen 3 3200g
dawm i missed the stream because i was in a useless exam of mathematemics durin online classes dang it
serious question, why say x86 when it is commonly accepted that the 64bits implementation is named amd64 ?
Intel : 11th gen 14+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++😂
Le están volando la raja a intel
I purchased a ryzen 3 3100
Wow finally I can use amd  athlon 200g  Lol
Love that -3% show alongside their other positive numbers.  Huge respect for their honesty.
AMD: *Cracks the 600point single threaded Cinebench bar with a whopping 640* Intel: But.. but.. Thunderbolt tho :(
intel coffin lake gen confirmed! 😂😂😂
15:30 Most of the gamers play on 1440p. I hope you fixed the issue with Ryzen 3 (fans issue, check on Google)
Why they increased their prices. You guyz were known for less price, more performance. Don't act like intel
Ryzen 1700x user right here. Looking to upgrade.
Hope they can get the drivers right with the radeon 6000 series.
17:27 it is epic!
4k 60 fps on bordelands3. Nice!! Now show us microsoft flight sime performance!!
Let's be clear . AMD already Killed the CPU game 4 years ago. But will never win the GPU game..
Wah iam happy so muchh
-3% performance in Battlefield Lol they really put that in slide 😂
A bit expense for an 8C/16T part though guys...?
$300 ryzen r6? wtf?????? i guess they completely get rid of the r7 5700x? also, where are the none x variants? i am not fcking purchasing these overprice shits.
If the average improvement from the 3900XT to 5900X is about 26%, imagine those who are upgrading from Ryzen 2000 series processor. 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Alright finally AMD, i think upgrading from i7 6700k to ryzen is totally worth it
omg i was the 120k view
I love AMD !!!! Thank you Lisa Su for AMD!!!
7:34  guy looks like Jeff Bezos but with some hair
So basically, $50 more expensive than zen 2 huh.  I was hoping for a 4c/8t at $100 in May but I guess that is going to be $150 huh? 😂
Stocks went up!
After watching this, i became AMD Zenboy :)
Nvidia and Intel still winning
She looks so proud and happy and lovely weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaa
Smiled when she said welcome everyone
AMD is charging Intel prices. LOL. Intel is charging Intel prices and AMD is charging Intel prices, lmao the consumer loses.
R.I.P. Intel 18 July 1968 - 08 October 2020
Hmmmm. I need apu series again but with high vega
It's a fatality. AMD is a clear winner
Anyone else still running R7 1700x?
299$ for a 6/12 threads CPU? No, thanks. And also sad story about 8 core cpu price up from 329$ to 449$
RIP Intel. Once AMD wins single core, Intel got nothing on AMD. There will be no reason to consider intel
The pricing is disappointing. No progeny for ryzen 5 3600
The comments are too toxic. Bashing over Intel won't make you cool and bashing over AMD also won't make you cool. Some of them are wanting Intel to go BANKRUPT. But if Intel goes bankrupt, them AMD will become monopoly and will charge higher prices because they have basically no competition (and vice versa). Competition is good for the customers. I like both Intel and AMD.  Intel good for single core performance and stability, while AMD is good for price to performance ratio (not on the new processor though), multi core and multi thread performance. Both are good on their own ways. So please stop fanboying over processors.   PS: And yes, don't reply that "AMD fAnS aRe cOrReCt AbOuT tHeIr fAnBoYiNg, WhIlE iNtEl FaNs ArE ToXiC "(and vice versa). Both are toxic.   Edit: I wasn't expecting to get any replies on this comment.
Kudos to AMD for not hiding -3% result That's Honest marketing A breath of fresh air among all false marketing
INTEL ---   WE GOT BEST PROCESSOR EVERYTHING RIP     LISA ---  HERE COMES THE MONEY MONEY GAMING IS LOVE
I understand nothing and yet i'm still watching everything.
90% of comments inn the live chat: 😡juan😡
320 thumbs down from intel^^
November 5 :(
Wow cheapest for 300???
Where the hell is APU launch? They were suppose to launch for DIY build. I am waiting since July OEM launch.
🤩🤩🤩
¿Soy yo o los precios de los procesadores son mucho más alto de lo que deberían ser?
mama su please 299$ for 5600x is to much make it 250$
Intel have got to pull something, I’m an AMD guy so idc tho
This content should be censored - YouTube shouldn't allow livestreams of public executions, especially of an entire company!!!
now i wait for this to be improved on in the 6000series so now i wait *hands crossed in thought leaning in my chair in the dark awaiting the day* and so.... this is where it all begins as of this moment you may not realize but history next year will be made. be ready be prepared because gamers a revolution will be made.
So excited for the 5950x!
Rip Intel
Intel exists Lisa su : Hello fellow company  Intel : changes logo and intensely sweats..
intel is ded
Intel like ☹️😔
Worth a watch 😉
Intel has left the chat.
I want Intel to release a disstrack asap, AMD just killed Intel
People talk about Lisa Su   But what about the mystery that is Mr. Su?
so theres no Ryzen 5000G with vega graphics? im pissed af
All hail AMD ZEN 3
I just bought a new intel cpu...... cwap
rest in peace INTEL....u will be remembered
Lisa Su : so we're powering the ps5 it's good   Lisa Su : and we're powering the xbox series X&S   Also Lisa Su : STONKS
AMD dropped the ball here... $450 for the 3800x? that's more than Intel! What were you thinking...
Can't wait to see Intel Pounce back (No matter how long it might take)
Time stamps?
Well done AMD
What does 4.6/4.7 Ghz mean? Is it 4.6 or is it 4.7 (the 5600x)
R5 5600X 299 USD, R7 5800X 449 USD, R9 5900X 549 USD, R9 5950X 799 USD - Congratz AMD, you did it again and the numbers are spectacular. Sorry Intel, go back to work, the ball is in your court.
lul people be mad that 5900x really has a -3% performance in Battlefield V against the 10900k yet they don't realize it's being released $100 cheaper than the 10900k
no poor man product this time, only high end X series, 299$ for 5600x, hope something like Ryzen non X already in shelf for 5 november
Looking at the games benchmark the 3080 does 72 FPS in Gears 5 when the Radeon 6000 does 73! But that is with the +19% unreleased 5900X So it might be more like 60 FPS apples to apples, or the 3080 might hit 85 FPS with the 5900X
Still rocking with my Ryzen 5 3600💪
Imagine being a intel fanboy
That woman actually understand the value of how important understanding the consumer keeping the competition, marketing and price all at the same time. Hat's off
There demo uses nvidia gpu not their own.
Before: intel the computer inside  Now: intel the computer that died
Side note...   is anyone gonna talk about how confusing it will be to have a 5600x processor while also having a 5600xt gpu?...   or by late next year if you bought a 6900xt gpu, but are upgrading to a 6900x cpu? ...   I really feel like this will end up being far more confusing then is seems it should be. Lol
linux will be ommg
intel sucks.i regret buying intel pc
Where's the bike?!
AMD: Legitimate innovation Intel: Increasing core clocks and power draw
Coffin: Intel inside
Looks like my x570 investment was well worth it. b450 peasants will never understand.
What's an Intel?
RIP Intel.
people in chat simping to lisa su
Whoever disliked is still stuck at 14nm++
Good show AMD, these work with AM4 right?
I'm just hoping Nvidia takes a SAVAGE beating in the GPU market with the upcoming RADEON GPU's. They see how Intel keeps getting punched in the mouth by AMD, and they don't want that SMOKE!😂😂😂😂😂
Director forgot to say "CUT"
Intel: Garbage inside
I just the winner of the console war is actually AMD
So they skip the 5700x pro release later?
Um, where is the 5700x?
Just amazing. My Ryzen 9 3900X will be replaced if i can get my hands on a 5900X :)
So how much performance increase is that over an i5 4460?
starting at 300 dollars
AMD is not so budget friendly after all
Way better than Intels....LOL...
I want Intel to release a disstrack asap, AMD just killed Intel
Dad, Why is my sister's name Rose?  Because your mother  loves Roses!  Thanks Dad!  No problem   Ryzen 5950x
I compared the data of big Navi at 23:33 against the hardware unboxed 3080 review and it shows in gears 5, big Navi wins at 1 fps.
Mr. Mojo Ryzen
i just got my 3900x why u bully me
new cpu here i come ;D
♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😭😭 AMD
300 for the 6 core oof... You do realise the i5-10600k costs less right? Unless you blow them out of the water in performance you screwed the pooch on the price/perf.
300$ for the 5600X is too much!
Hahaha my PC literally just fully froze once during this presentation. No task manager, no mouse movement, no sound, just a freeze image. THIS CANT BE A COINCIDENCE!!111!!ELEVEN! So there are only two explanations: 1. My i7-6700 doesn't want me to see this 2. AMD hacked YT and made my computer freeze so I consider updating to ZEN 3
F for my a320m-k
It's looking very promising. Fingers crossed that my B450 mb is going to support R5 5600/5600X so I can upgrade from r5 2600.
For 26% performance increase from my 3900X to 5900X, the price difference seems to be higher and quite enough for me to stay away from upgrade. 3900X is still doing great for me to warrant any upgrade within a year.   Having said that, I am still very much happy that AMD is bringing some competition to the table which is very good for consumers, just hope that they read the market properly for competitively pricing their products to get an edge VS Intel or Nvidia.
I can't wait to buy these 10 years from now when it's under 100 bucks
I quickly checked performance of RTX 3080 with these games in 4K and it seems like nVidia will be still a bit faster :( but I believe AMD will deliver this performance with significantly lower power consumption :)
She is Light.
Got my Ryzen 9 3900x and waiting only for radeon 6000 series to build monster. Gimme card and take my money!
lisa: starts speaking  intel: so i took that personally
Take notes Intel. "best in class in every dimension"
Forza AMD....state lavorando benissimo.
Exciting! We together with 1usmus going to make a review for all new Ryzens as soon as it gets on the shelf in the US. Can't wait  😋
Dr. Lisa Su  just put intel in the Bargain bin !
eyo give me free cpu
1:26 That's literally the same case I got for my next pc build.
der cache is geblieben...
why 299 for 5600x??
This was very underwhelming in my opinion.
Was expecting 7nm+
299 dollars for a 6 core cpu what!!!!
Advanced Micro Devices by AMD
Thanks Lisa.
Dr Lisa Su speech in a nutshell.. Dr.Lisa Su : RELEASE THE KRAKEN!
i3 10100 топ за свои деньги 😎☝️
AMD is the real winner of the nex gen console wars
Intel is so fucked with their 14nm++++
great amd. Competition is always good. Come on intel. Show your muscles.
F
Does 5000 series support ddr5?
Too soon for the price hike. They would've completely owned the market if they kept the prices the same or gone for a smaller hike.
V raytracing was shown a bit... so it seems the Ryzen + Radeon will work together for in-game raytracing?
Ruined by the price increase.
Am just thinking about  who just bought 3900 series before this event .. 😂😂😂.
​is it suitable for 5000 series am4 ?
1080p, whats this 2004. Makes no difference in 4k, so forget intel, amd need to focus on beating the rtx 3090
What about r5
NICEEEEEEEE!!!!!                              It’s a jojo reference  And the new gpu name
RIP INTEL
6 core price $300!! This is not fair amd pricing
Intel: why do I hear boss music playing?
Please save us Lisa
AMD YES!!!!
Those Who disliked are intel Employees , hehe.
AMD 4 life!
5700X when?
Good thing ididnt waited for 500 series bought 3600 becuz seeing 5600x all though of course more improvement butcore and threads remains the same  and tbh console still uses zen 2 so knowing most games will use 6 cores i am saved for now
They used Tomb Raider because its one of the only games out there that takes a linear advantage from multi core... I remember those guru3d benchmarks... Big navi = cant beat rtx 3080 performance and I bet it has much lower RT performance too (If it even has it)....
Performance is awesome but srsly 300$ for 6 core cpu? someone must be retarded :-( Why it not stay as R 3600 now, same price :-(
30% in gaming is amazing but I'm kinda dissapointed regarding pricing. Performance per $ is litterally the same compaired to Zen 2 right now          -ah yeah, and RIP Intel
RIP intel, RIP wallet, RIP big navi
Where are the APUs???? Presented in July and you cannot buy them ANYWHERE!
People who are going to upgrade to 5900x from 3900x... throw your 3900x at me... :D
5800X 1CCX???
Prices has gone up quite a bit, except the 900
The future is of amd only
What happened with intel with all the rips?  Enlighten me
Интел,готовь очко
POG
I am, kinda of sad, if the Ryzen 5 5600 doesn't come soon, I'll be sad :(
Watching it on mobile 👀, without having pc
amd: heres the ryzen 3 lineup intel: hey guys, heres 14nm+++++++++++++ lineup
My current processor was $300 - the 2700X with 8c/16t. Of course, the $300 5600X here is going to blow it out of the water on performance, but why are they dropping the -700X tier and assigning its price point to the -600X tier with 6c/12t?
I'd be really excited about this if I cared.
Intel coffin Lake
And now they've increased their prices. AMD knows there are no longer any underdogs in the CPU market.
This lady is the Boss, I'm very optimistic about this!
Apu relase kab hai
Safe to say,by the end of this year,for the many years i use i5 5thgen.I will change to ryzen 7 this year.
Awesome Great Year To be broke
So are we ignoring the fact that AMD now does the intel move by becoming more expensive than intel itsself for a 5-15% performance gain in gaming at max? seriously 550$ for the top gaming chip! that is exactly like the 9900k was and the 10900k is now priced, I was hoping for AMD to beat intel in not just performance but also the price by a huge margin, but at least they got the performance now so that is something...
I feel ripped off even though I havent bought anything yet...      Time to wait for intel 11th gen (don't hit me pls)
💞
those shoes don't match the outfit .
RIP ZEN ZEN+
Marry me Dr. Lisa Su!! Your success is impressive and alluring 😍
AMD is reducing Intel's ass to atoms
no apu cpu?
Зачем нам r5 за 300$, если в dns могу взять i7 10-го поколения за 315$  ? Процессоры интересные получились, но цена )
Thanks AMD for bringing amazing gaming In my budget.
Lisa Su: "Oh, look at little Intel Jr.  Gonna cry?"
Does anyone know if or more importantly when you can preorder these CPUs?
just make them cheaper and release in pakistan too
Good luck intel
temporary solution to fill market, 5nm will break rules and this 5nm processors and video will be very interesting 🙂
NOW WE CAN SAY RYZEN HAS RISEN IN ALL ASPECT BOTH GAMING AND CONTENT CREATION. WITH BEST SINGLE THREAD SCORE AND MULTI THREAD SCORE THANKYOU AMD Ryzen waiting for big navi
why 5 ghz  no :(
Lisa ended Intel's whole career lmaoooo
Issah' Su!
24:30 They used a 2080ti for the benchmarks so even they couldnt buy a 3080 😂
Intel is Best
I always though that Intel would became a company as powerful as skynet/Wayland but Queen Lisa changed the future...
19:20 the moment you've been waiting for
Meanwhile, in poor man's land with no Ryzen 3 in stock: "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
Welp. AMD charging Intel prices for 6 core processors. Not cool.
Will a B450 mobo support these processers?
A link with some more details to the test systems used for the benchmarks would be nice. What kind of GPU was used, what RAM + clockspeeds? Sata SSD vs NVME? Chipsets? I'll wait for the independent benchmarks for now, not to mention the Radeon 6K announcement :)
wahnsinn, danke Lisa
Why didn't you guys uploaded this video 9days ago i bought ryzen 5 3600 9days ago 😭😭😭
AMD burst intel's bubble
Love you. ok thanks bye
Intel new upcoming 11th gen tiger lake watching:  👁️👄👁️
русские на месте???????????
Ryzen kicking intels smug little complacent face in is somewhat enjoyable to watch
$300 for the 6 core, ouch.
AMD: Fine, I'll do it myself!
Mission passed
so this RX6900xt propably is BL 3 in Ultra at 60+ and RTX 3080 avg 65! this is a tie on FPS and actually AMD wins because you dont need a nuclear power plant to run it and is for sure cheaper!!
Also i am your fans
Damn, those prices really jumped!
I appreciate amd for not making me regret buying a 3600
Damn it, I bought 3950x last year now 27% improvement? I got scammed XD
Ryzen 5700x 65w tdp? :(
TAKE MY MONEY!
Benchmarks results are by a system with NVIDIA RTX 2080TI ...!!!!
it is a very cool processors!
Just writing this for those in chat not knowing anything aka idiots (not the comments but live chat).  People talking about the -3%. This was done for transparency to show they have nothing to hide to their customers and get more trust.  AMD CPU costs being too expensive. Have they not seen intel prices? They are identical but AMD offers what they claim as a 26% increase and better performance then intel at the same cost.  RIP NVIDIA. This is not true at all, their best graphics card could barley pull off 4k at 60 FPS. Unless their prices are super low AMD has steep competition in this regard.
RESUME: INTEL OUT = 11/05 NVIDIA OUT = 10/28
F intel
If u have intel 10th gen. Don't upgrade lol its not worth it if u just bought it like a month ago lmao.
I have a ryzen 5 3600x and i really enjoy it
Very disappointed, they didn't even break 5GHz. and only a few games they perform better than Intel.  I expected something huge from AMD, but it is ok if it supports existing AM4 motherboards(300/400 series).
If BIG NAVI comes out on 5 Nov too, Nvidia is in trouble big time
Bring more chipsets to the laptop segment. The 4000 series was amazing but it was out of stock almost all of the time!  I wanted to buy a 4000 series for my cousin and ended up gifting him with intel due to the lack of amd powered laptops
rip intel
Please fix your drivers, specially GPU.
How much was the 3700x at launch?
I think the next intel cpu's are gonna be named coffin lake
Intel - why i am feeling dead ? 😑
Its incredible CPUs
I really appreciate them for putting up ALL stats, including the ones where they only won by a few percent, or even lost by a few. The transparency is nice *cough Nvidia *cough*
In Europe I9 10850K aka i9 10900k under 453€/531USD free game Avengers VS Ryzen 5950X  680€/800USD. TR 5%, TW5% come on, more 227€266USD that competence. Mark said " to Lisa show off" That the true story here, show off!  Innovation would be to compete at the same price, +/-8% more performe in game, less power,  but 266USD, this is too much for so little difference in relation to competence.  At the time of building a new machine these factors would make the difference, but not for 266USD more...
RIP RTX3090
Well the price for me is to high now. 6 core at 300+ i will be keeping my 8 core 3700x for a long while now. the price to performance just isnt there to change for me.
AMD You Are The Best!
Damn it they increased price of the Ryzen 5 5600X and did not yet annonce Ryzen 5 5600 :( I feel sad now...
REMEMBER NOVEMBER 5.... REMEMBER
GODsa Su! GODsa Su! GODsa Su!
4k 60fps in Borderlands 3 for radeon gpu where the 3080 gets about 66 ~ 70fps give or take a few frames. And she didnt even say which gpu. Just "Radeon 6000"
Here before tech youtubers made any videos about this.
I really wish the 5800x was $340
Who else agree with me that the price for the 5800 and 5600 is too high?
5600X is cheap but the B550 is expensive as hell lol (At least in my country)
300 for a 6 core??
When your stock doubles intel
Next intel cpu:     In the Coffin Lake
No wonder AMD's where's at, with Lisa Loud at the helm! :D
AMD just brutally murdered Intel. Alexa, play BFG Division.   Can't wait for RDNA2 bring for ray tracing gaming!
I bet intel be making coffin lake.
So about the BL3 thing: The zone shown in the video is a very laggy one when i played i had a 30% performance lose in that zone, there's so many foliage and fog which takes a lot of performance, so 60fps 4k is pretty impressive
HOLY HELL LOOK AT THAT RYZEN 9 5950X performance !!!!! i9-10900K got DESTROYED COMPLETLYYYYY!!! OMFG 4.9GHz!!! 16 CORESSSSSS AND 32 THREADS HOLY $HIT!!!
So to amd get 631 at single core a 5ghz 9900k only get 530ish, big navi gets 60+ fps 4k bl3 and 3080 only gets around 50 in 4k, that's huge
Ok, impressive but i will wait Zen 5 with 5nm for upgrade . RX6000 only 3 minute :v
Thank you AMD you make world better 💚💚
to much price.
Literally no one: The chat: *RIP INTEL*
Can we OC Zen3 to 4.5Ghz all cores stable? Because at 4.5Ghz + 20% more IPC im sure it will beat Intel in all workloads...
Take my money!!!
17:23 i love the fact they still put the (-3) lmao, they should've not put that cause thats a failure against the competitor lol. But btw its amd is a beast
This is way to expensive
Intel: My time has come
Remember Remember, the 5th of November...
Will work in the x570???
The fact that the highest TDP is 105W implies that these chips will be able to be overclocked so 5ghz is definitely doable. Huge mic drop presentation with the GPU teaser at the end!!!
nice cpu
Thank you, again. Dr. Su.
23:11 Show us a gameplay of Borderlands 3 of your new GPU and dont use the benchmark of Borderlands 3 because that is not good way to see the results of the gpu. Also I want to see how much can it handle doing multitask too both CPU and GPU
8 core 5800X for $450?? Was hoping to upgrade from my i5-2500k, but not at that price. The last gen 3700X was far more reasonably priced for 8 cores.
Intel is officially dead
Requesting 286 burn kits :D
INTEL: no man can defeat me ...   LISA SU:  i am no man
Just curious here - are those the equivalent prices to Zen 2 at launch? Or have they increased/decreased?
Лучше купи райзен
I hope we get readeon cards at $280 which can run as an rtx 2080. XD
Why are you use rtx 2080ti in tomb rider demo? You can use your own products like big navi.
amd yes!!!干翻牙膏厂
RIP INTEL🌷
Extraordinary
bleh prices went up a lot
"Holy intercore-latency, Batman! I think they stole your soundtrack!" - Thanks AMD for delivering once again. :)
Still think nvidia 3800 is an good card and that big navi will be in the middle of the 3070 and 3080(more close to the 3080) but with bether prices i think that amd will take the market by a lot.
$300 is too much for 5600x
Incredible
Very nice. Fastest is a good start, particularly vray rendering was a savage 59% beat over intel 10900 but I would have liked to see the clocks touch 5 or above, just for pyschology :) TSMC has done early production of "5nm" since last year so I would really like to see that implemented soon. Really no need to wait to 2022 and let intel catch up. At all :) I may be biased because I hold AMD stock but still :) Well done guys. I'm hoping big navi can at least match 3080 and be a real challenger to nvidia. Winning on two fronts against big market shares is again not bad for my stocks :) I'm low key hoping for a navi20 on 5nm. I say why not :)
it is funny when they use nvidia rtx 2080ti to benchmark the new cpu with because rx 6000 is not yet revealed
for a launch release event like this, u would think they would get her a better sounding mic
This is what it must feel like to be an Apple user, having a 3700x feels like I've got super old hardware. 26% increase in performance!!!! Wow. That is insane.
I run MW ultra 1440p @ 60 now with a 1070 and a i7 4770k. And you're telling me big navi will only be capable of 4k 60?
RTX 3090 is still ~25% faster than big navi based on benchmarks done with a i9 9900k warzone benchmarks
Intel struggles to get their nms to 10 LOL
Cool los nuevos Ryzen 5600X, 5800Xy 5900X. Bienvenidos.
Intel $700 CPU gives 48 PCIE lanes AMD's $700 CPU gives only 24 PCIE lanes AMD = Fail
Hope the processors will show up on the CPU Benchmark fast.
AMD: we bring way more performance for the same money and same wattage. Intel: haha plus go brrrrrrrrrrr
Why do i hear funeral music in the backround?
I am starting to love AMD.
Lol the demos were all running on Nvidia GeForce 2080 Ti's
Intel marketing department are now out of bullets. They will now stop spouting their nonsense "gaming" performance anymore.
Great processors. But let's be rational, the Ryzen 7 is overpriced. It could've been 499$ and maybe this comment wouldn't exist.  AMD was loved for offering great value for money but now that they have switched places with Intel, they don't seem to be any better?
On November 5th every one is invited to show ur last respects to Intel on it way to funeral.😎😎😎
AMD know how popular and better their CPUs are, so they are increasing the price with each new ryzen launch. jump from 200$ to 300$ for 5600x series chip is quite bad for budget consumers.
Will it finally be time for me  to upgrade from my 6 core Sandy Bridge-E OCed @4.7 GHz from 2012?
Disappointing presentation to the max. Where is information on 5600 or 5700x. No one cares about a 700 CPU. I need to build a Desktop PC soon, was waiting for this to know if i should wait, and this told me 0 worth information
I'm sad not because I used to go with Intel, but because I got a 3900x last year and I now want a 5900x!
So the 6000 series (what exactly, probably the biggest one?) achieves 61 FPS in Borderlands 3. The 3080 achieves 65 FPS.   That's really close.
24:27 Graphics: Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 TI
4 k 60 fps hahahahahhahahahahhahahahha.Nvidia rtx 3090 8k 60 fps LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
The background looks like terminator
The nail in the coffin : 14:44
im hearing coffin dance form the distance..
What about APU I'm gonna buy a R5 3400G for my b450
амудешники на связи
I thought there would be budget processor like the Rygen 5 3600. Alas😭😭😭😭😭😭
They used 2080 ti's for testing lmao
Thanks LIsa Su :D
A9-9425 user here, hoping to update one day
450$ for 5800X, what a disappointment , Intel 10700k is 400$ :(
hi der 8auer
R.I.P Intel and NVIDIA
amd needs to remove robert hallock like bastards from company who lie and bullshit people with fake information
rip  intel
299$  for a six core processor, get lost AMD.
Bit disappointed there's a price hike in comparison to Zen 2, but that's to be expected I suppose considering they've just taken the performance crown in every department.
Notice ANY improvements they showed in their slides, were gained on DX 9 , or DX11 running a controlled track ( benchmark mode ) .... kinda pathetic ... also 25% gain over your last gen, which was 25% behind the competition just puts you where intel has been for a year now... seriously what are ya' doing?
R.I.P Intel  (-----.  -. 5 November 2020)
5600X for $299? How does it compete with i5 10600k for $279?
Disappointing prices
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Call 911 guys... we witnessed a murder here...
Shits way too expensive
Ummmmmm what about non x cpus??????
Ryzen processors will be popular when game engines actually utilize more cores of processors. Currently most game engines (especially fps games) only utilize 2 cores so having higher clock speeds and better chips is what is best for gaming. Ryzen processors are going to be great when game developers start developing games that properly utilize the cores that ryzen has rather than cheaping out and using old engines. Untl then, Ryzen can toot it's horn but no one is really listening.
Thanks to AMD for letting us use cheap intel processors
Yow! Im getting Ryzen 5600x its only $460NZ lmaoo
Now let's talk about overclockability or upcoming Rocket Lake. Or the 10600K, which is the best value gaming chip right now.....
Wtf what will budget gamers buy no apus and no 6/6 thread cpus😔😤
We are better in every way!   *in 1080p.
aaaand its gone
Intel holding the best gaming performance CPU crown with the 1000 series. Today AMD Zen 3 reveal. 5950X: "Bonjour".
Hope new Big Navis will also be made with Samsung HBM2E...full bandwith, like VII has... still a fantastic GPU
The MSRP prices are a bit too much for me. I bought a 3700X for my upcoming build for $269, paying $449 for the currently available newer gen upgrade 5800X is WAYYY too much.  That's around 60% more money from the usual sale price of a 3700X to go up to a 5800X for a ~26% gain in 1080p, especially when factoring in higher resolutions where CPU is less of a bottleneck.  I do wonder if they'll release a 5700X with lower clock speeds for less than $449 to make the gap less massive, but for now I think I'll just keep the 3700X (and not return/sell it) as I wait to snag a 3080 and build my new PC.
Athlon 64 flashbacks but imho Zen 3 seems MUCH better. AMD is finally the new king in gaming performance too.
Very well done. Keep up this good work, C. U. on 28th...
Rip Intel
Glad to know AMD is now offically calling their top-end RX 6000 cards "Big Navi".  EDIT: (hooray for AMD listening to fans!)
She's hot ..  i mean beautiful and intelligent
Thank You AMD
Launching November 5th 💪🏻😎💪🏻
WTF BIG NAVI SAME FPS AS 3080 and actualy a bit over 3080 lvl omfg i am so glad i waited for AMD
summary : R.I.P INTEL
Radeon 6000 series gets 61FPS in Borderlands 3 4K, the 3080 hit 69FPS. Dead in the water.
HAHAHAHAHA 60 FPS... DOA Big Navi is big flop... Ryzen is great, but not Radeon... Nvidia is unbeatable... Ryzen 5000 ment to be paired with rtx 3000... It's fact
AMD Лучшие!!!
So, the 1080p comparison is not a good look for a processor price point (3900X/5900X) where the buyer would be playing at least 1440p at 144hz or 4K at 60hz.
Did they mention preordering?
RIP INTEL
Ryzen 9 5950X - 16 cores, 4,9 GHz max turbo and 19% IPC uplift --> Code:Brown @ Intel. :D
Motherboards? Socket? Where are we supposed to put those CPUs?
I'm glad I waited to pull the trigger on my cpu build
Amd : literally dominates Intel Intel : 14++++++++++++++++++nm
Intel fanboys be like  *Look how they murdered my boy*
AMD: breaks record in multi and single thread performance at lower power consumption.  Intel: but can you overclock higher??
So Expensive-
AMD POWER SUPREME!
This video should be named amd roasting intel for 30 minutes straight😂😂
where is 5700x ?  its one of the most popular options to buy 5800x is a bit expensive for lot of people
Definitely one for the history books.
I don't like the pricing tho, they dont even tell you if buying ryzen 5 5600x over ryzen 7 3700x is going to be worth it.
Im not excited i was waiting  For the 3080 i had the money and was waiting for the drop well long story short i don't have the card i hope this does not happen again with amd but i bet my left nut that it will
You are egg 🥚انتم بيض
I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it... I NEEEEED IIIIITT!!!
THE NEW GOD HAS ARRIVED !!!! AND ITS VERY EAGER TO KILL !!!!!
Lisa Su RULE EARTH...👏👏👏❤❤❤
CPU looks amazing. GPU needs to be pushing way more than 60FPS on Borderlands 3 at 4K, it's easy to run. Same with MW. GPU not too hot, but CPU is mouth watering. Just price Big Navi right.
That price hike vs last gen though. :(
24:28 Pause and read carefully AMD used RTX 2080ti for benchmarks  Edit: Damn! They are releasing the new processors on my birthday (too bad I can only afford Ryzen 3 and they haven’t released it, and living in india doesn’t give me an advantage)
they used 2080 Ti s for the testing lol
Big Navi on par with 3080 it seems?
F
And I bought a 3950x a month ago... 😩
great performance, but the pricing is way too high.
i need references for big navy performance. anyone? how does the 3080 perform in those?
Now just imagine that the 4K performance on the RX 6000 series GPU is from a lower end model.
So, no cpu at/under $200?
AMD: 5000 series Entered the chat Intel exits the chat!
ok so 4k 60fps while nvidia's rtx 3080 can do 8k 30-40 fps. but the rtx 3090 can do 8k 59 fps
Great!! Thanks for specific information in 20 minutes ;) I've got now so much hype for 5900X or 5800X (currently 3700X) :)
Absolutely impressive!
Press F to pee on Intel's carcass
$300 6 core  $449 8 core  what were they thinking?? This is intel pricing.
AMD is not holding back, and I love it!!!
RIP Intel'
Coffinlake i9
is it true that there is not gonna be a ryzen 3?
No 5.0 boost.......
♥♥♥ i love you AMD
Dislike people are intel gang...... Cying between ryzen gang...... 🤣🤣🤣
$50 more for all CPUs?
Them showing the -3% was them being honest about their product. Stop complaining about it.
Rip intel 🖐️🖐️
What about zen 3 APUs I was waiting for it form months my heart is broken 💔
First time seeing an AMD event, but oh boy, it's a big difference compared to Intel. They do know what they are talking about.
So much for being cheaper than intel
razen 5 5600  300$
Жаль что нельзя купить на прямую у амд,  что бы без наценки в 250баксов
Well im hyped but pricing is just weiw way to much
Is Intel dead?
Dr. Lisa Su, please you have to come and watching the people behind Radeon Graphic driver when they make a new driver. Please, Radeon Driver is always the weaker side of their hardware.
no mention of a new motherboard chipset :(
Yooooooooo
I need mobile version NOW
yoww
I wanted to wait till ddr5 release to upgrade from 7700k...
AMD: kills Intel and digs their own grave with the 5900x me: let's go AMD on top!!! AMD: you thought, we got 5950x Me: BRO, YOU'RE POOPING ON A DEAD BODY NOW
2020 brings with it: The Return of AMD to the top. Looking forward to Big Navi. Stronger competition in the high-end market is great for us customers.
dislike for the price !! and that navi performance is weak compared to RTX 3080 !
Intel doing the crying jordan so hard right now
RIP intel
That was awesome
only $799 for a processor that will be lesser than a 10900k which is $500... Dafuq AMD smoking?
was like mortal combat
These products Gonna be way overpriced in India......
Isn't amd CPUs getting a little expensive? I guess this is what happens when there's a lack strong competition
AMD for the win! Can't believe it, they come so far! Single threaded performance is better now, people will stop complaining about it lol. And 60+ fps on max setting 4K? :O
Ok ok can we all say there powerful but a bit expensive.
ssup
They finally did it.  Delivered the coup de grâce to Intel.  Literally no reason to buy Intel for gaming anymore.
My birthday present. A new ryzen cpu
Comment section: 1%: Talking about AMD. 99%: Heh Intel rip hehe.
Team red :)
It's fantastic!!!!!!!!!
R.I.P.  IN/VIDIA
Thank you Lisa, very cool
What GPU was used in those Shadow of the Tomb Raider numbers? Details are always left out in these ?
*yes*
Wow
인텔 바이바이
The 5th of November, eh?  Bonfire Night? Is that going to be a bonfire of Intel CPUs? Haha!
Wow, but people will still buy that Intel CPUs...
Intel left the chat 😂
Lol Why'd you pay 300 bucks on 5600X it's expensive for a mid range CPU...rather buy a 3600 over it
As groundbreaking as these chips are, I had to laugh when she pulled a steve jobs with her "oh and one more thing.." and their ABSOLUTE TOP TIER chip that isn't out yet didn't break 5.0ghz, lol.
Could this be the end for intel or nvidia , chune in next time :O
AMD YES
Good joke AMD, so what are the prices?
Bruh November?
Wait...   60fps at 4k is exciting new news?
Jesus christ intel just got absolutely murdered.
Absolutely smashed it, well done AMD
AMD go brrrrrr
Brooooo im so getting a 5950X 4.9Ghz is a much  free FPS without GPU Upgrade lol
gg, it ended  sticking with zen2, the gpu is nothing special  but, I'm still hoping for it to be cheap
Who runs their 10900k at stock speeds?
INTEL RIP. NIVDIA RIP.
rip intel
Amazing, can't wait to upgrade my system end of year.
299 for 5600x, u can get 3700x for that price, and it will get even cheaper
This is awesome! It looks like Intel has to finally play catch up!
rip intel
Technology sure is moving forward with AMD!
ценники интересные конечно
Bruh moment. 5600X for 300$ is quite a lot.
still on N7? interesting
I love lisa su, intel crying. Again.
So how much is the 5600? And is it any better than 3600?
$300 for the 5600x? is it really $100 better than the 3600?
ngl im fairly disappointed with the prices, i wanted to go 5600x, but ill prob settle for an 3600.
5 November is my Birthday!!!! Thanks AMD my best birthday Ever!!!
F for Intel
No way, nvidia win this time. Rtx 3080 can run those games at 4k with 90+ fps. Buy i hope amd wins in terms of pricing
BUY 5950x and Radeon 6000 on 5.November 2020
F for Intel
At this point rip zen 2 as well
Based on that info I will be getting a 5900X however GPU will be a 3080.
АМД ТАЩИТ!!!
tough one for intel
RIP INTEL
88fps in 4K COD MW? That's awful.
Now call those coffin meme guys the time has come
BBRRRRRUUUUUUHHHH THAT WAS LIKE A MOVIE PREMIER
AMD is on fire 🔥🔥🔥
Holy moly this is amazing
Best presentation ever.
OMG AMD <3 Rip Intel and Nvidia
RIP INTEL KEKEKEK
Big Navi gonna be a fail im afraid....
Is it me, or are they more expensive than their last-gen counterparts?
Who's getting the 6 core?
AMD : you guys are AWESOME
Amazing, bye Intel, now Nvidia Im not surprised you are shaking in your boots.
Ouch nov 5?
Well, rip intel.
You all are invited to pay condolences to intel fanbois on 5 november 2020
Greaaaaat
No thanks I'll wait for rocket lake
intel's funeral is coming... await the coffin dance
BIG NAVI ⚓
Nivida will be buried on October 28
can't wait for an ryxen 5950 with rtx 3090
Availability ...
Someone compare fps VS 3080
and here come the bears.....
Are there any updates about the 3300x coming back in stock?
Intel.....Bye bye...
Intel has been just ripped
If Radeon can beat "green". I'll be impressed
5900X is absolutely awesome value
nice gpu surprise at the end. good stuff. now wheres my stimulus check!
I am HAPPY!
November 5th EVERYONE!
What about Zen 3 laptop CPUs to compete with Intel 45w TDP??
5.november is too late!!
vidkari szar, proci jó röviden xdxd
Dislike for the price!
Well it's official, Intel's been put on notice, not the leader of anything anymore.
BIG RIPS TODAY
I almost feel sorry for intel😂.
RIP Intel LUL
300 dollars
intel😥😥😪😪😪
Intel is beaten, is Nvidia next....
to future, dead me: i was here
WOW!
Let the games begin!
Not impressed. No 5 GHz 1T boost or GTA V FPS. RDNA2 looks great so far though!  Guess that guy on HWBOT is getting my money for a 3950X and i'll be going Zen 5 in 2022 or so.
$800 a bit steep!
799? No thanks
lel that stutter on gpu demo
Damn, that was quite the double kill.
Hawt gawd damn boiiiiiiiiii
rip intel
Drop the mic!
😂All The Dislikes Are The Salty And Pissed Off Intel Users Rn😂
Intel just died inside, ceo collective suicide
No X670 chipset?
Intel : Farewell
Wohooooooooooo!
Ending on a cliffhanger? Oh no, I want it now!
gg
pricing is on the higher side
Price is little high i guess  !
F in the chat for Intel.
F for intel
Нормуль
Man, she is unstoppable! Way to go!
Dr. Lisa Su is an absolute management beast... Made AMD to what it is today. just WOW
Rip Intel🤩🤩🤩
Nvidia out of market and supply
that's what's up!!!!
OK intel is ded af
So nice
Way to go AMD! RIP Intel.
Thank you Lisa, that was fantastic
Processors looking great, a bit underwhelmed by big navi
Good job AMD.
WHEN RYZEN 3 5000?
Remember remember the 5th of November )))
AMD look we can do 4K, Nvidia, who is 4K? we all 8K now.
oh! I wanted my Athlon 5000G
Big Navi was kind of underwhelming
Wow
They totally ran through this presentation.
Considering Dr. Lisa Su was initially brought in as an interim CEO she's done a pretty great job helping to turn AMD around. Hopefully we will see the same improvements with the Radeon division as we have with Ryzen.
sooo how many password hashes can i crack with this baby? :)
Hype
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AM4 compatible?
Sorry Intel, you lose
Привет АМУДЕШНИКАМ
소리벗고 팬티 질러!!!!!!!!
This is amazing Intel is now completely dead
Somebody Better be Playing The coffin dance on Intel's funeral.
Intel should probably starting trying huh? Lol
F for intel
rip intel
Holy heck is the chat yucky
Lol the bl3 frame stutters
Amazing price
Will work in the x570???
Anyone saying prices are high need to see a specialist right now
Thanks Lisa Su and Mr. "Papermaster"!!!!
Taiwanese mommy just went NINJA on Intel's a$$.
now i have a reason to upgrade from a 3700X lmao (after a price drop)
This makes my Navi The Big Navi
AMD really livestreamed Intel's murder
robert hallock is biggest liar in amd
<3 <3 <3
Big navi !!!
RIP INTEL 2 mins of silence 😶
nvidia: thank god pffff,  its only intel amd: let me introduce rx6000
They officially called it Big Navi.  Lol.
AMD out here murdering Intel and NVIDIA
AMD dethrones Intel and Nvidia in one swoop.
“Best at every price point”........unless you want to spend less that $250 🤦🏻‍♂️ 😳
@AMD Nailed it. Well done! I admire your engineering and business model, keep it up.
INTEL : Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo :-D
So the 5600x will be $50 more than the 3600.
Too expensive for 3600x, 3800x
Lisa Su has changed the game, no pun intended. Well done
Is there a Ryzen 3 5000 series?
5900x here I come. Have to upgrade from the amazing 2700x
That pricing..... a little pricey considering how poorly the b450 variants are supported
Woooo!! Big navi!
No ryzen 3 :(
Omggggg 5950x omggggg
700$ for Ryzen 5 bruh, AMD turning into intel
That Cache Tho Whoo
really cool CPUs, but so expensive :(
For those complaining why the price has increased: its beacause the covid-19 all computers components are priced up so if you want to get it cheaper.....W A I T
fake clock speed increse
Intel better step up
That's it! Buying 5950X!
My next CPU is from AMD
Cry Intel cry .....
monopoly starts here with 5600x at 299 ..... I had a feeling .. lol
Rip intel
Damn, longer wait for 5600 :/
APUsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Intel just died today
Lol only a 5% gaming increase for $800. No thanks.
I can see A lot of people attending Intel's funeral on October 8
As an intel and nvidia owner i hope AMD kill these two greedy company someday
Rip Intel
R.I.P Intel
300 $ for a 6 core cpu -_-
This was the day that Intel died.
linus fart tips
Prices r a bit high.
This is an Epitaph for Intel...
AMD officially kicks Intel's ass right now!  I swear to god...
All those dislikes come from Intel engineer!
isn't it too high？
Epic.
12 cores for 500usd wtfff
I can see the Lake drying up over on intel.
I’m laughing my ass off at the fact that I know people will still be mad that it doesn’t have 5GHz boost.  And at the same time having 5GHz in the 5000 Series would have been neat :D
кто русский ставь лайк, а то все комменты английские ни хера не понятно!
Maybe Space Engineers finally won't lag? 🤔 Jokes aside, I'm looking forward to my next upgrade this winter, which will be an AMD based configuration (probably with an RDNA2 VGA) for the first time in many years.
oof was thinking of going to 8 core but damn AMD prices now are basically just as high as intel now.....def not upgrading then yet.
The Xbox Series S / X and PS5 just became outdated in one foul swoop.  Maybe Sony / Microsoft should have waited for this and release the new hardware next year.
Take my money
I can't tell if this is good or bad lol
Err intel? You okay?
pls give us x370 chipset support!
Good lord. RIP Intel lol
AMD has done it. It just cleared the consumer market out. Well done!! Intel would have charged $1599 for 5950X. At $799 - I'm switching.
36 MB cache ._. What are you, you're not a processor
WHERE IS 5700X
300$ for ryzen 5 5600x is way too much...
I BOUGHT A R5 3500 FOR 80 USD AND NEXT GEN IS 300 USD HAHAHAHAHAH PANIC SELLERS I LOVE YOU
The dislikers are intel fans and intel employees 🤣
when will guys like gn or j2c get hold of these for overclocking and testing?
4.9 ufff I'm wet
To expensive 5600x for £€$ 300 ? Not worth it to upgrade, wait for next year 5nm.
Heading to the bank and asking for a promotion rn
My wallet is crying rn
not really happy with the price though😥
RIP Intel
Is that budget Tim Apple over at AMD?
$300 5600x or 3700x for $300...
Battlefield performance was -3%! AMD didn't mention anything about this even though this should be very important for FPS gamers.
Lol not buying any of them then
Wait $300 for 5600X?
Intel still has a chance
the 5900x is basically a thredripper but its meant for gaming and streaming
5950x Please!!!
4 gen
"Cinebench is not real world performance" Intel *tears in eyes*  Also Radeon cards being able to run 4k 60fps anything is impressive. That takes a real level of power. Nvidia may actually have something to compete with for once.
Rip intel
I'm sure Intel will be able to be competitive with AMD eventually. That being said, I don't see myself going for a Intel system anytime soon.
Blue was the imposter
200 intel employees disliked the video
i hope when you compare 5900x with 10900k the price follows. else its not a good compare. and not fair.
Intel just died   10/08/2020 11:21 AM
There is no such thing as an intel fan boy now. Ouch
Mam Lisa Is My Idol
AMD YES!
Chat: 50%: RIP INTEL 50%: other comments
But can it run chrome?
No I won't want that chip...ill wait until real revolutionary products
Where are the Apu's 🙂
Кто русский, напишите коммент, посмотри сколько нас!
My wallet be like - don't do it, don't do it please
xDDDDDDDDDDDDD rip intel
Its not a big upgrade of you don't get very high fps.
AMD FX is still alive guys
"we know that you're gonna wait for benchmarks"  BAAAHAHAHAHAHHAA!
Lost against BFV. No biggie lol.
Dislikes are bots of Intel
If AMD can get anything above 500 in single core prdformance o on there Ryzen 5 say RIP to inrel
I was here PogU
I really wish I could afford this lol
RIP INTEL
19 percennnttttttttttttt!!!!! 🤣
Ждём zen 4
okay farewell intel , till we meet again
its like no one realizes 10th gen intel is half a year old now, intel and amd are going to keep passing each other because of their release schedules
Rip intel
These gains are NOTHING revolutionary AMD puts!!!!
can’t wait to get the 5600x
i love competition as a consumer
And intel stock goes doooooooooown
Why there is no 4000 series?
AMD YES! Now, who wants my brand new 3700x ?
Darn I wanted to updated from an 4th gen Intel Desktop to 4th gen Ryzen Desktop.
Rocket Lake? More like Coffin-Lake 🤣
Not even a single time intel's name is taken
Totally hyped here :D
Will b450 motherboards support ryzen 5000?
Rip Intel
GET REKT
I don`t understand why would anyone dislike this video. If you don`t like it, you can just leave.
Wanna hear a joke?       Intel😂😂😂😂
Intel celeron are still faster and so are the hd4400 integrated graphics amd will never catch up to intel
Me with my just-bought laptop with Ryzen 5 3550H :(
Rip intel (i am still going to buy a i9)
🥱
Will these not run at 1.5v constantly like the 3900x though...
RIP INTEL 08.10.2020
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
hahahahha intels grave go brrrrrrr
Get to the price AMD
No one cares abut 1080- gaming anymore. give 2k and 4k specs
so It's 4.8 Ghz at 105w Rip intel :))
RIP INTEL 🙏
a lot of Intel comments ... on an AMD presentation :))
But I don't play 1080p
League of legends and CS:GO be ready for 1000fps
Intel will answer with Piss Lake Core i9 processors at 14nm++++++ proccess
rip intel i3
Some say to not kick someone while they’re down.  Guess we know AMD doesn’t follow that...   Rip intel
Shut up and take my money :)
Guys you might wanna turn down the de-esser a bit. Everyone sounds like they have a lisp. Nice presentation btw
I’m sold lol
RIP intel
Now AMD 5Ghz is real
They need a different transition sound. The epic sweep is cool but it's odd when it lasts 2 seconds
One second silent for whom bought intel😶
Coming from an i 7 920 @ 4.0 , this is gonna be a ride....
Thanks Lisa
Shintel
So should I sell my 3600
Intel dug it’s own grave and jumped in

I'm all ready to not be able to buy one because of launch day scalpers.
live long Lisa su
My 1992 computer is still better than any other gaming PC 💯
Stormworks build and rescue just found the best server cpu. New FPU is going to be epyc.
Wonder how "live" it is. Probably recorded on beforehand.
alright where are we going to put intel's grave?
Improve what ? zen2 is enough for another 5 years. can use intel chips for smaller IOT devices
( ﾟ∀ﾟ)o彡°AMD！AMD！
wew   (๑>؂<๑）
Mark looks a bit like Bill Gates lol
I'm going to withhold my F for Intel    They'll have to pay me $150 for it
90% of people talking poop about intel owner's can't even afford to build a new Zen 3 system, lol.
They just destroyed intel
Today would be intel's doom
Bullshit
Thoughts and prayers to those who just bought intel.
I thought executions were illegal?
Please
Intel: Was I a good boy? God:You were the one of the best.
Intel's funeral is looking crazy
Intel bois are disliking the video

Curious to see if you will hike prices much due to the leadership position edit: 50 bucks is about as much as they can get away with imo so i guess it makes sense, should go down in price a bit with time
She said best single thread performance !!!!

I watched this live and was in my zoom class at the same time, you know how?   RYZEN FRIKING MULTI-CORE PERFORMANCE
epic gamer moment
Unrelated to the actual content, but, why are they trying to simulate presentations with all the downsides and none of the upsides (actually being there). They should have done it in many cuts, and showed full screen graphs when talking about things. Could have used much better audio solutions. Would have been cheaper and better. It just looks weird that they think the stage is some core part of this when it adds nothing.
Seems my next build will be Ryzen.
I know Linus is somewhere in here.
This is HUGE!
161 dislikes, intel 14nm fanboys
Still Intel fast in gaming lmao. EPIC FAIL.
GO AMD!!
dammit first the 30 series now Zen 3 I just built a new pc and these guys are telling me to do it again...
let us take a moment of silence in remembrance of Intel
+19% IPC: gorgeous! Please like this!
Hit like to destroy Intel 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I use commentaries even till presentation
who is proud of AMD?
All these dummies saying 'RIP Intel' don't seem to understand it was Intel's dominance that caused Ryzen to be created in the first place. Competition is good.
this guy sounds like the automated text to speach you find on random youtube videos
RIP INTEL
Nice
Dislikes are by intel fans

YES!!!! Single-threaded performance!!!
Can't wait for an absolutely disastrous driver at launch like the last big one.  Show me 5ghz. All I care about. It's absolutely needed for 3080/3090 and VR.

rip intel
The only reason I'm still with Intel is because I haven't upgraded yet.
They wanted to disrupt the pc market. They began that when Lisa and the team began the journey that has led us to Ryzen and to this day this very moment.
Ryzen is lit af 🔥 like if you agree

Intel: Why do I hear boss music?
What's up nerds
Whatching this with 3900X :)
RIP intel.. In the Loving Memory of Intel
Even if you don't buy Ryzen and only stick to Intel you should be grateful for what AMD has done. From 2011 to 2017 we were stuck with 4C/8T as 'high end', the comes Ryzen and suddenly Intel makes 6C, 8C and now 10C. Prices has also improved in many segments. The lack of competition was a big problem, thank you AMD for making Intel step up and improve!
This is gonna be good
DELEN MUERTE A INTEL POR FAVOR 🔥🔥😃☇🔥☇🗻

My next upgrade will be an AMD CPU & GPU if they deliver close to or better price to gaming performance than Intel.

I just hope the prices remain sane, don't become like Intel AMD. :)

Bruh i have been using my dads old computer with Intel for 4 years.  So excited to get a new ryzen based. Good bless AMD
Performance - Ryzen 5 5600x = Ryzen 7 3800x Ryzen 9 5950x = 2x Ryzen 7 3800x  Price - Ryzen 5 5600x ~ 249 Ryzen 9 5950x ~ 799  Before launch and premiere, I am saying this. My guesses
Today they make history.....

i like my 3600x very much, but sure i will upgrade! Never Intel again...
Please type an F in chat to pay your respects to Intel

АМУДЕ ТАЩИ АМУДЕ ТАЩИ!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whos Here for  the Intel Funeral  ?

Quien sabe NVIDIA ha comprado ARM los creadores de chips de memorias que hará  junto con Nintendo en el futuro.
Time to play ZEN yatta in overwatch ^^
AMD SUS I SAW THEM KILL INTEL IN ELECTRICAL
This is what happens when you put an engineer in charge instead of a corporate idiot - you get results
I have the msi bravo17 with ryzen4800h and radeonrx5500m, is perfect
Press F for intel  r.i.p.
apology for poor english  When were you when intel dies  I was sat at home watch youtube when lisa ring  'intel is kill'  'yes'
Intel watching this be like: 👁️👄👁️
Wishing they have budget processors coming
Shame that COVID-19s still here. Can't attend Intel's funeral.
STRAIGHT UP
I hope they would have so much technology leap in Radeons too..
Safeguard against bots so people can actually buy the CPU's

Rip Intel
Finally amd gonna destroy intel🤣🤣
125 peoples are intel employees
I have been using my i7 3770 for 7 years now. Intel all the way!!       (I'm buying one of the Ryzen 5000 for sure)
AMD AMD AMD AMD AMD
AMD must unite CPU and GPU departments. Work together to the greater goal
You can see how much people love AMD by the like and dislike ratio
53,000 watching... an hour before it even started.
Excited 🥺
*2 times faster than 2080 ti*
lol f in the chat for intel
Dislike are from intel users
5900x or wait for 5950x ? (estimate price vs performance)
I was born in the right generation.
my prediction: within 10% of intel in raw single thread perf (either way), but at 40% lower power.
Mama Su I want you. Those chips don't lie.
Pog
Where is Intel team sit? I don't see them. Something went wrong, Will they come?
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
the time have come for intel to pay for its overpricing and under delivering strategy！
Todos los dislikes son de Trabajadores de Intel
What works be the starting price? I wish it would be 300$
It is indeed RIP for intel.  The Zen architecture has been slaying since the day it arrived.  And now with the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft launching, as well as Zen 3 products on schedule, Intel is pretty much going to be in the dark for a while.  What's the kicker from all of this?  AMD is still seen as the "budget" brand, but the difference in performance is not a joke anymore.  "Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard".  Take note intel.
We wish Lisa Su good health and all the best from Egypt❤️
peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeg
Everyone thinks 2020 can't get any worse     Intel crying in the corner
Today is my birthday, watching this Zen 3 release is such an amazing gift for me..
Dr. Lisa Su.. She's just a LIGHT..
Lisa, I want a child from you!
Bruh I am waiting !

Really interested to see how it will go for budget workstation
wow! so many people attending a live execution. R.I.P. intel.  you were never liked and will not be missed.
​AMD YES
Intel: Amd is the impostor. Consumers: Ejects intel. 'Intel was the impostor'
Intel: Let me die in peace Amd: I thought you had already died
Apology for bad english where were u when intel die  i was at house eating dorito when phone ring  "intel is kill"   “no”
LISA THANK YOU SOOO MUCH FOR REVIVING AMD! Although I am also a fan of intel, you have done a lot since you became CEO. 🙏
Thanks, Dr Lisa Su and all AMD employees for enabling these technological advancements!
Im hyped!!!!!
Intel Fanboy buys 10900K, Overclocks it to 5.2GHz, Buys RTX3090 and pairs it all with 1080p monitor for 500 fps in CS:GO, since it's more than 480fps on AMD :D :D
AMD YES!
AMD Yes!
CEO of the year goes to Lisa Su.

Now this is the story all about how, Intels life got flipped turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how Su became the princess of a town call Silicon Air.
What is the expected cost of Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 with Zen 3??
85 Intel fanbois disliked. Update: 115
Talk about expectations
The Hype is real. I was driving like colin mcrae just to be on time for the announcement.
85 dislikes were intel staff knowing they're about to lose their jobs.
I built a new computer january of 2018 this computer is really strong and only momentary laps of driver issues. mainly because i bought new tech at the end of the family line up but hey the computer runs great featuring AMD ryzen 7 1800X cpu
Amd: Launches zen3. Intel Engineers: Can I join u guys?
14k likes, it hasn't even started :D

My brain is like an intel chip: it's total rubbish with creative applications, but the gaming performance is pretty decent.
リサ！！！！愛しています！！！！
Lisa su te amo mami
Great time to have AMD stocks
I'm waiting for months for this event.
Ничего не понял но очень интересно
ここにも日本人いる？
I support AMD because they were the underdog for so long and still strived to be the best and give us an alternative to intel. I'm about to put together a new build and AMD will be the featured CPU.
Exciting
Viel Glück für die Vorstellung und dem Launch eurer nächsten Zen und Navi Generation! Es beginnt nun wirklich eine neue Ära, und wir hoffen das diese eine Rot-Goldene wird. Freundliche Grüße aus Deutschland 🇹🇼 ♥ 🇩🇪
Lisa Su for president! For workers class!
Next crush the 3080 so that I don't have to pay more than 1,000 just to game at 4k. Thanks!
Best health and on one of the best CPUs.  I'm so excited. Best regards PinkeyTv from Munich Germany
I hope that the leaked roomers are true:)
AMD pls crush my i5 7600 by 100% & you will get my money 💰
Intel>>>>>>>>Amd

Remember how stereotypical things were when it came to AMD temps,   Now look how tables have turned :)
amd is the best
Intel's funeral will be held today 8 October at 6 pm
AMD THE BEST FOR EVER
Would be awesome if Big Navi can come close (or BEAT) the nVIDIA RTX 3080. I'm pumped about their new Zen3 chips.
Waiting if it worth to upgrade my 3700x.
I'm guessing they won't be announcing midrange stuff today? Like the Ryzen 5 3600 replacement.

In Indian Standard Time live event is at 9:30 PM.
Far do sallo ki and hum tumare sath he
I don't even care if it's mire expensive this in time, they deserve the extra income after what intel did to them...  Next generation though I hope intel come back and make the market competitive again, it's better for all of us.
Can't wait to get ryzen 5000 and rtx 3080... The best combo ever...
What time does this start?
I hope I can get my hands on zen 3, big navi this year
she is the man now 🤟🏻
amd is doing a giveaway of 1000 ryzen zen 3  cpu's
Waiting
Lisa!  Last step for Intel knockout.  Finish him!
They should have more subscribers
That two dislike is Intel and NVidia.
I hope every one has a good date

Hoping 5Ghz is broken without some crazy setup, perhaps will perform great with demanding games with 3080 and as my docker server for coding
the dislikes are from intel employes
will there be 5000 or 4000 ?
Best wishes for Lisa su thank you so much AMD  May God Bless 🙏💐
don't worry people... Intel can't dislike this too many times... their cpus will overheat from the bots running on them...🤣
70 Intel fanboys already showing hate 😅🖕🏻
So Excited!!! Mama Su do us proud 😘❤️
lets see how my 8700k will hold up
waiting for ahtlon vs i3 r3 vs i5 r5 vs i7 r7 vs i9 r9 vs ???
I wish they would release a Ryzen 3 | zen 3 with  6C 6T for $130. It would be awesome if this came true.
Still rocking first gen Ryzen, but I'm still excited about the next gen
All the dislikes are Nvidia and Intel
RX 5700 XT is capable of ray tracing at 60 FPS but AMD won't add it. :(
I hope their advertising will be better giving 100mhz lower speeds than the actual chips can clock so users not get panic,I NEED BIOS FIX,MY CPU IN CLOCKING LOWER THAN STANDARD,I HAVE BAD CHIP,AMD PROMISE ME BETTER CLOCKS MY CPU IS FAULTY on Reddit.
Bring AM5 with PCI-E 6.0 and USB4. Need 16 core/DDR5 5000mhz and RDN3 !
Who dislikes the video even before starting! I'm really confused!
AMD: lets innovate a make even better CPUs, again :-)  Intel: lets make another 14 nm chip and milk customers some more ;-)  BTW those 62 dislikes are funny. Probably from Intel marketing lol. You made my day! ;-)
Please be better in gaming than Intel finally
Как попасть в чат PRO PC

We are waiting from bangladesh for this event..Love you ryzen,we hope you will also lunch your chip to our country to... Please please
Waiting if they release ryzen 4000 APUs also and most awaited pricing change at backstage 😂
can reach for 3000 series now tnx amd
Ladies and Gentlemen we are gather here to witness live murder of intel. Today is the day when intel finally laid to rest after a painful dead.
I am already very excited
Check my own Zen 3 meme on my channel! ( @sahka )
60 dislikes from intel fans
Hope Zen 3:  - Mainstream CPUs are now APU (using RX 5000M, not the RX Flop series/Flop VII) - R7 is 12-cores for US$400 - Couple back the IF, instead of gimping it.
With love From Kerala,India.
I'm more excited for Radeon GPU than CPU. I mean competition is already dead on CPU side, now we want strong competition in GPU to get lower price GPU.
I wonder when Zen 2390409245890394598190354091095091349050931489583974789581348731984689318497893418975893415983428915891389589134589139858931498759834759838714859731487589314895731598347195713984571893578938975138958791389513987598013904857981348957138974587913879583971457891387958974137895783485987341789578913457893178495897134890578138795431879 will release, wont that have 29092309503 core cpus? om certainly exited for the Threadripper 3409534985908390590342095209903209459043290X!

I am Ready for Super Saiyan Zen 3 🔥❤️
Мне цену только надо если адекватная цена будет то соберу райзен 4 поколения и 3070  ахуенно будет
Maybe this will send my AMD Phenom II X4 Black Edition into pension. But I am not sure. It still works well for what I do. It's mostly a workstation (Photoshop, AbletonLive, Adobe Premiere, Adone Lightroom, Maxon Cinema 4d and so on). Apart from that I just play games like Europa Universalis IV, CSGO, World of Warships anyway. They all work. Exception is Hell Let Loose but it's poorly optimized anyway and with my current FPS,  not less playable than with the system of a friend (Ryzen 3700x). So, it's the game optimization and perfomance boosts can be expected once they sort it out.
ONLY AMD RYZEN❤🤘
Значит это райзен 4 поколения да?

Lisa Su for the President of this planet Earth.
​Lisa Su is strong contender for best CEO of 21st Century. Hell of a way to manage being an engineering.
GUYS !!! Stop making fun of intel ,,,  I cant like all the comments !
*Лайкайте этот комент что бы англичане и американцы думали что я написал что то крутое)*
the 58 dislikes is intel's marketing department.
JUAN
All the best for Ryzen users and Lisa Su from Russia.
F for Intel.
Watched using a THREADRIPPER rig
58 dislike LMAO
intel is most probably looking at this on their big screens with all partners and CEOs. lol
Red red red red auuuuu red goes  faster AMD - Anakin Skywalker. Intel - younglings Master Skywalker there too many of them 14++++++++±++++++++++nm
FIRST !!
We want a Razer blade 13 and 5800u in it pls AMD 🙏🏼
Plot Twist: They do a surprise reveal of a single GPU within Big Navi/RDNA2 near the end of the event, saving their powerhouse flagship models until the GPU Reveal Date.
Welp, 1'44" before Intel's burial
Intel: Please Mrs. SU, just STOP PLEASE. Su: No...
amd turned me, this will the cpu for my first amd build in my whole life, always been with intel. but amd is the one who deserves my money right now.
I just switched to R5 3600 from a 8th gen Intel and a LONG run with intel (since Athlon 64 days). Couldn't be happier, love how AMD has RYZEN 😉 from the ashes and now it's leading in performance. When this new gen gets a lil cheaper in a year or two I'll upgrade again since I choose B550 MoBo to future proof my Rig. All Hail LISA AND HER AMAZING TEAM! ♥️💪
INTEL TOP 1!!!!
Looking at the comments, I wonder. Am I the only one just curious and not fanboying?
AMD is the future
Greetings from India 🇮🇳💖
Something Bigger is Coming
Maybe +15% IPC and 5 Ghz today ? :)
All i have to say is bye intel
es hoy =O
Gen 3 gonna fit nicely in my B450 mobo.
Lisa Su is My fav CEO!   LOVE FROM INDIA AMD!
These CPUs are gonna be crazy, let’s hope they stay cheap(er) too
Covid 19 - I'm gonna ruin 2020! :D   Intel - Business is fine thanks Covid. :D   AMD - Hold my beer!
Just leaving my mark to prove I was here when AMD beat Intel in gaming. TEAM RED FOR THE WIN
Lisa Su you are all in our prayers from around the world.
I can imagine a Csgo match with AMD staff vs Intel staff
Does anyone care about AI performance here ?
"8 October also is the same day when Lisa Su became a CEO of AMD" .. oh yeah
Ребята из чата PRO PC, отзовитесь.
Press F to pay respects to Intel
I'm looking forward to getting a Zen3 cpu or two, to test in the lab!! 😅 🙌
It's time to say goodbye to my i7 2600K@4.5..You were the best buddy!
Imagine disliking before the premier even starts lol
Can't wait even though I won't buy anything cause I'm broke for life lol
2 HOURS BOYS
I planned to upgrade from Ryzen 3600 to 3900x but now i will surely consider new products if they support x570 mobo. Can't wait to see new AMD GPU 😍
If AMD can officially hit 5.0ghz for once, Intel is officially done
Hyped, let's go!
ЗА ПУТИНА ЗА АМД

Fun fact : you wanna see the video asap, but the video hasn't started yet 😂
Intel dying in some hours
R.I.P Intel ZEN3 will be great <3
Приветствую всех уважаемых русских амудешников
The dislikes on this video are from the people who bought an  Intel cpu without researching first
한국인들이여 좋아요를 눌러 한국의 위대함을 알리리라
I still have my Phenom II Black edition 6 Core paired with RX480....I really want to buy another computer. Just so difficult to save up. Monkey 🐒 jumped in my window during lock down and I spilt my coffee ☕ over my PC so the graphics card stopped working. Sat with a hair dryer and alcohol rub trying to clean the mother board. Eventually got it to boot again although the GPU won't work 🙄...not only do monkeys pull up flowers in the garden they also put my PC on the brink.

SIIIIII ACEPTAN MI RIÑÓN COMO PARTE DE PAGO
Intel won't get down its the main tech of US which has many other uses in industry sectors and various areas and gaming is just a side picture of intel
23 years ago I started first AMD PC, now still AMD
R.I.P intel 10/08/2020
Waits Amd Mamms Show. Lisa Rape Intel Again.
3 ночи.. Ну ок
Go red team
Eoooh I am excited I ll going to build on new Ryzen
Intel Rocket Lake gonna explode before it can even lift off
АМД ТОП.ЛАЙКИ СТАВИМ ЧТОБ ЛИЗА СУ УВИДЕЛА
AMD is the best
Guys anyone, should I buy a B550 or X570 motherboards for Zen 3 Ryzen? Or can I continue with my B450 Motherboard?  will it be compatible?
It haven't even started and people are disliking stuff that they don't know about. Strange Update: Sad 10900k user voice
Woooo lets gooo
Ripintel
Intel is about to have a big oof
INTEL RIP: 1968 - 2020
I can't wait y'all
I am hoping to see the new threadripper with shared cache for consistent memory latency and motherboard for it up to at least 1 TB memory support but they said it could even go to 2 TB that'd be very nice ! =D I also hope the cores can boost to at least 4.0 GHz and maybe have base clock of 3.8 or so... but ok they probably will have 3.2 or something, maybe even lower... hmmm time will tell.
imma be honest i have been using intel for the longest time but if this "zen 3" is anything like the rumors say i might just switch over
i hope it will be release on low price 🙏
Please don't screw up like Nvidia. We need IN STOCK products!
\/\/Like AMD - \/\/Dislike Intel
Thanks Lisa for turning AMD around. Amazing feat!
Thanks Amd for making gaming cheaper!!
Intel: need a new logo to get more sales.  AMD: Still being the best option.      Pls dont scream to me about 10400 and 10700k and those stuff about intel
Ver a Lisa Su con un procesador en la mano es la imagen del PODER
I like her because the saved the AMD from bankrupt and she is a very good leader that makes good price graphic cards for everyone around the world.thanks Ma'am
Can we expect threadripper news today?
I’m waiting so I can build a system with the new parts when they release in India
Where is 4th gen btw😃
С Русских лайк ведь мы египетская сила
How can you idiots disklike EVEN BEFORE the video is online?!! It makes zero sense
Who even dislikes these videos, so dumb. smh
The 74 dislikes at this moment is Intel disliking and expecting to create a butterfly effect.       I'll get 5600x :p
Can't wait to check the AMD new Ryzen Bikd
Maybe 2020 wasn't as bad: Nvidia: Announced 30 Series with a brilliant price to performance.  AMD: Announced the Zen 3, which sounds brilliant.
Hello from Russia! Привет из России!
Zen 3 baby!
One minute silence for Intel and Intel users .😑😑😑  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂        (I am also an Intel user till today and getting new amd powered pc)
Those 71 Intel employees disliked...RIP Intel
wow
RIP Intel 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly.. it's time to buy AMD stock. Anything below $90 per share and you're getting a great deal.
AMD, hello from russia. We have a simple problem, the cost of 3600 box is 20000rub, and cost of 10400f is 15000rub. How it works? Its a mistake of our marketplace or value rub? Request for me pleeeeeeasse
I can't wait no more 😁
Intel : oh no
I still got an i7 4770 from 2013, maybe it's time to upgrade? :)
Intel Bought 66 Dislikes
Finally time to upgrade, moving from Intel HEDT to AMD!
OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!! :D
Will the prices of ryzen 3000 go down this week??
Waiting to add ryzen 3 zen 3 to my channel.
They will beat Intel I swear
good luck AMD <3
а чё всмысле
WHERE IS 4TH RYZENS?
The main reason why I'm angry at Intel is the fact that each time a security flaw is patched out from my CPU the performance goes slightly downwards. But there has been so many security flaws in the past several years with my CPU model, I can say that I own a HALF CORE processor. The only reason I didn't already buy a 3000 series CPU was the announcement that will probably drive prices down on Zen 2 or I'll just go ahead and buy Zen 3.
Lisa Su: Test the 5900x vs 10900k at 4K Result: no difference Amd fanboi: .l. intel Me:NANI!!!!
waiting for new desktop processor
RX4D !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please give us some info on big navi

don't mind me im just here to pay my respects to intel

Good luck AMD
It would be nice to see Lisa bring out a 10900k purely to stamp on before they bring out the new cpus
Love you Lisa su❤️❤️
Дизлайк поставила компания Интел и ее работники😂👍

Intel: Change logo AMD: Change architecture xdxdxd

Fun fact: now people will say that games are optimised for amd and Intel is for those who want there pockets to rip off!

Please AMD,  I will buy computer 8 years later, Last one had intel cpu. I really want a ryzen but exchange rates are too high in my country. Please make it reasonable price every cent make huge differences in some countries.
I've been building PCs since 1997 and this will be my first AMD build
The day intel died
And now my friends Intel is officially dead
Y’all can actually see this I want to watch but it won’t let me :(
Amd - we just need to improve very less per core ,and per thread performance to beat intel   Intel - we need to increase our cores,threads,bring 5 nm , decrease price, provide good value and need to support one socket for long time, and give efficient stock cooler   RIP -intel
Wait, so gaming only just started-
Bring us the best 😃👌
55 dislikes from Intel!
Intel must be shivering..... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha......🤣😂🤣😂🤣😁
lisa su is my idol but i have one question, whats your new cpu thats cheap? 🤔🤔

Lisa Su is Amazing
I LOVE INTEL🤪🤪 SAID NOBODY EVER!!!!!
Omg, its happening 😇

Я женюсь на Лизе Су

Finally upgrading my X4 860K on Fm2+ mobo with DDR3 RAM next month hahaha. Zen2 or Zen3 depending on price... Give us some good news please AMD! Decent prices and better stock availability than nvidia would be good ;-) Also can't wait for Big Navi! GPU is next year's upgrade :-)
When your next gen GPU
Intel days are numbered
Based Lisa
50 people showed up here hours before the video is even available just go dislike it. Either you're butthurt by AMD for some reason or... well I don't know actually.
Why i did buy r9 3900x yesterday......
apology for poor english when were you when Intel dies? i was sat at home watch AMD Zen 3 and F5ing for Ampere GPU when Pjotr ring ‘Intel is kill’ ‘no’
And That is was the death of Intel..............
Today is the Day! ZEN Day!
I am super excited
Ryzen : Raise cpu cores, raise frequency, raise quality of chips....  Intel : copy paste, something no buddy cares about, no pcie4... (also intel: we don’t need innovations, only a logo)
If they don’t mention that the 5000 series is the worlds fastest gaming CPU I’m gonna riot
I wish there is a good cpu with a cheap price to make the ryzen 5-1600 cheaper 😭
The Monster Reborn Again
Zen 3 The New Monster
Finally 9:00  intel dies #RIPINTEL hope so pls :)
and 11th gen of Intels still being faster in games, gg
AMD  YESS

Amd: Launches Zen 3 *Intel has left the chat*
"I am really need three screen to show you" 🤣🤣 A darkness nightmare of intel come back again to day?? 🤣😂😂 Love amd, love Lisa, from Vietnam 😙
If amd can finally beat intel in single core or even match it with better pricing.. then rip intel
Only 1 brand beats AMD that also not in CPU its none other than NVIDIA
It makes me happy to see AMD having such a resurgence. Competition is good for the consumer.
Hello from Russia.i love your processor ryzen lisa.
MAIN Reasons to buy AMD 1)BETTER THAN INTEL=NO COMPETITOR
Hahahaha, see you at the first quarter of 2021...
3k dislikes are from intel knowing they gonna lose their job yo

I want it
Can't wait to see new processors. Also maybe will be some hint about radeon? This is what I really want!!!
yes yes YESSSS my body, my wallet, my pc, my dog, my house, my FBI agent, my kidney all are ready YESSSSSSSSS
İntel is ded *insert Voldemort laugh*
Long live red queen!!! <3
Ну привет, Райзен 4000
2020: Intel vs AMD.  AMD win  2024: AMD vs Nvidia ... win?
Can't wait to grab a cpu and gpu from the new lineup
Vamos a ver que tal sale ese 5950x :)
AMD the best
Will build new computer based on Zen 3, or maybe Intel again
Lisa Su ---->The Ray of Hope to all those wooden PC owners who want to upgrade their system so that they can go above 15fps...
I was waiting and finally
Here's written "GAMING"  Rip Intel
香港人留名
Best AMD Ryzen
sadly can't watch the live as that begins on midnight here... :(
Bro i just bought ryzen 5 3600
Call intel they are crying
THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL "Where Gaming Begins" WONDER IF THEY'LL BEAT INTEL  IN GAMING THIS TIME?
This game takes forever to load.
If AMD manages to clearly beat Intel in gaming...What excuses will some gamers find to keep buying Intel? Cause I guarantee you I have friends (and family) who will come up with something.
People are just complaining about their time zone. But I'm happy to be here in India. It's just only 7 hours. Hehe
AMD: Where Gaming Begins Intel: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
*Everyone* : 2020 can't get any worse  *Lisa Su* : Well you aren't wrong
The only thing left for Intel is making SSD's.
how can u thumbs up when u have seen nothing?
Yes!!!! Amd
Imagine being Intel's CEO and waking up to this  *R.I.P*
We Wish Lisa Su Good Health and All The Best From India 🇮🇳❤️
Dislike For Intel.!!!
The moment intel are dreading 🙈🙈🙈
This is the day my wife has been fearing for months!! My wallet is ready
Кулич, ты тут ???
Lol Intel fanboys disliking this vid
Meanwhile in Intel: Let's think of some new name for our old technology, that'll definitely sell!
When are they launching Big Navi GPU's? Seems like they are just churning out processors for sometime now. Great processors though. 👍
Доктор, мы ждем.
NVIDIA is still the BEST!!!!!         i use AMD
What this lady has done for the industry and consumers is a short time is inspirational. Her and AMD have changed the entire landscape not just for gaming. It just goes to show that wanting to be better, to be the best pays off more than greed and being comfortable. One of the best examples of a turn around in recent times.
This may lead me to buy an AMD CPU. If it is good :)
Intel: exists   AMD: I'm bouta end this man's whole career
Friendly reminder that the best thing we can hope for is not for AMD to curb intel and absolutely destroy them!  Instead what should happen is that Intel also needs to perform competitively alongside AMD  AMD is a company. Intel is also a company. They don’t value our brand fanboyism and they’re ready to monopolize when given the chance. Don’t let AMD become the old intel one day.
That 40 dislike is intel marketing department employees
Was waiting for the launch god bless Lisa and the team from AMD
October 8th: Wednesday Oct 8th 1879 Naval Combat of Angamos. Glory for 🇵🇪 Peru and Admiral Grau. Wednesday Oct 8th 2014: Dr. Lisa Su takes office as AMD new CEO. It's not a COINCIDENCE. Both are Team Red.
Hyped?🔥
40 dislikes were set by Intelboys.
BEST AMD!
Surprising that very few things have leaked compared to the NVIDIA GPU launch.
I dont care if Intel cpus are 5% slower or faster, amd has come long way in couple years and gave us great cheap and powerfull cpus.
Hello everyone, welcome to your PC history class, and don't ask me why I already know that you are in 2040.
Waiting to build ma first AMD system..!!
A new king is coming
The hype is high.......Welcome Zen 3!!! 😀
Intel funeral speech.
AMD please make it affordable and competitive against Intel. I have been waiting since June😬
I love amd
Lisa thanks for helping out budget gamers with the amazing prices
Yes Yes Yes!!! ZEN 3! I love Ryzen and I LOVE AMD!!!!!!
Hi
Those 38 dislikes are from Intel fan boys
Let's get it AMD 💪
bye intel!
Dislikes = next Intel nm process.
Get ready with your shovels and diggers because today is Intel's death day !
who is an amd gamer here? l l v
Intel dislikes this
May the force be with you!
AMD stock after this event: Stonk 📈📈📈
8 hours to go
how much momey is it？
This is epic boys
Рейзен обновил архитектуру и убил нвидию
#Question when will they be available?
this is the day that Intel dies
AMD beating INTEL in gaming sector too  That's how it ends....
2020 going hard on intel
😱😱😳😳🥺🥺🥺😧😧🙀🤩🤩🤩🤩
is there any ryzen 3 ???
Ждемс
The Intel slayer company
tell me what is the use of boosting core frequencies when it is used less than 70%. Question about prescision boost
Well my job here is done, good day my goddesses and gods, remember Google's Calico and PraBhuji in Action. :)  I am in the process of manufacturing 7.6 billion goddesses and gods.  So Google bought a company Calico, promising a 500 year health span by 2100. Judging by the fact that everyone around me is living for 90+, we probably are post-millennials= the immortals.  So, you can compound your money for 170 years and be financially independent. Perhaps a quintillion dollars enough for your generation over the healhspan.  You probably going to live for 500 years. I am getting my MD PhD in reverse aging.  We are future divinity, all sentient life flora and fauna evolving.You'd have your twenties body in your nineties.  We have cured partial blindness in adult lab rats already using reverse aging the epigenome sequences for mitotic division, this is not just a theory anymore.  This is the beginning, we are showing you will power. Pre-space faring 500 years healthspan civilizations.  Next i'll show you 100 trillion dollars, pre a five hundred trillion dollar era. Be healthy, wealthy and wise.  We can not only slow aging, we can reverse aging. I am giving away my money for free.  Ofcourse you'd want to live in the present moment, the 500 years is a possible healthspan, we don't know it will be more than it.  You can go build civilizations on planets. Have twenty children over 500 years.
Me: *sees this* My playlist: *plays Pursuit - **CORNERED**   Me: "This is a good sign"
I got a b450 board and stuck with 2000 rn, should i one way flash for 5000 and get a mid range one  or just get a 3700x that's cheaper?
What will be price of these processes in india anyone know?
I hope good desktop processor availability, i don't want mess while buying , else i'll make my own processor against AMD😆🤣
RIP Intel
R.I.P Intel.
I hope the prices go down for the next gen zen 3 arch. Better boost clock for higher core counts at low power consumption
Даёшь скидки на Ренуары!! ;)
U know why ryzen forgeting 4? Its considered bad luck number at asia...
RIP INTEL
Ulalal
I’m so ready
f for intel
Hopefully all the cpus have integrated graphics as well just in case the gpu stops working
If intel doesn't keep up then we're pretty much in the same situation back then. Amd would price it anything they like because of no competition.
Coffin dance for intel fan boiz😁😁😁
3am in Australia lolol rip my sleep schedule
We hope AMD offers us a good price !
I wish there is an budget one too Who else is waiting for an budget cpu.👇
There is a dislike for every "+" after the 14nm of Intel pp
Лучше купи райзен
Here we go
I WANT THE RYZEN R7 5800X!
32 dislike...Intel Family ah ah ah ah ah ah.
ALL HAIL AMD!!!
Yeahhh!!!!!!
O community of the comment section: what is your wisdom?  What is a good midrange B550 or X570 mobo to compliment a midrange ryzen CPU? Not planning on doing any crazy overclocking, may do some minor OCing if it's fairly easily done and worthwhile (as I am inexperienced in OC).   Primary Goal: 1440p 144Hz gaming Secondary Goals: some livestreaming, probably some video editing, probably some CAD software CPU: some midrange Zen3 Mobo: ??? GPU: rtx 3080 or 3070, depending on reviews / availability PSU: undecided (depends on above) Ram: 32 gb, speed/make undecided (depends on above) CPU cooler: arctic liquid freezer II 280 (front mounted) Case: Lian Li Lancool II Mesh  Suggestions are welcome!
Leggo 5950X
Щас Лизка сделает красиво)
My i7 8700k still has potential but perhaps in the future i will get a 5700x!
nicokim ready and waiting   https://twitter.com/nicokim18?lang=en
When does AMD produce Ryzen 5 5600 ??
From a Bulldozer I'll upgrade to Zen 3, the excitement is real.
Eastern time sucks
Ooo my god the intel fanboys are early ..... dislikes!
Wait, didn't it say Ryzen 5000 earlier???
gamingggggggggggggg
AMD WARP SHINKAA!!!
Can't wait for all next-gen hardware and features to be on the table, it's been such a long wait! USB4 is still MIA despite having been announced so long ago already, and at one time I really thought "Zen 3" would probably have it by 2020, but I guess neither AMD nor Intel are interested in having it this year, and we'll see how that goes next year... At least PCIe 4.0 and HDMI 2.1 are already out in the wild.
Intel: Why do I hear boss music?
thank you Lisa <3
9 hours lads
So excited guys
pffff, gaming was already begun 30 years ago ! haha always to late ! AMD ;-)
I’m actually gillla
I see everyone cycling through different chat sections including my ownself. Feeling like Eid.
I just brought a Ryzen 7 3800X 3 months ago lol
I'm hyped
I will be in school when this starts :(
waiting from a long time ago😍😍😍😍😍😍
Amd one love
so how's everyone enjoying balding gate 3? I heard someone say   it's a reskinned dos2   I have to say it's pretty spot on how the game starts you on a flying ship and u crash land on a beach. it's more dnd5e than anything so it's pretty cool. I hope Matt and gang make some appearances
IM HYPED
Zen 3!! Let’s gooo
Lisa is my queen lmao
AMD YESSSSSS
Ходят слухи о росте производительности на ядро  +15-20% .   Если так , то это будет прорыв.  Наконец-то AMD  обгонят Intel в игровых задачах.  Об этом нам кстати и намекают в шапке грядущего анонса.  Надеюсь, что условный Ryzen 5 5600(XT) будет стоить в районе 200$-250$  и рвать при этом i10600K-i10700K.
We hope for next gen  DDR5 and PCIE 5 with 5 nano  ... tks a lot
why not 100% uplift, 20% is just too mere
i can't waiting,come on
Lisa su we love you
Hope there's no big price hike... Remember what u said with zen how it's about increasing affordable availability of hcc in 5hr desktop
Гроб к интел уже едет.
AMD YES!!!
Intel: 5 frames more on gaming no one can beat us  Amd 2016: hold my beer
ONE MINUTE SILENCE FOR  #RIPINTEL 🙏😇
Rip intel
RIP INTEL
25 intel boy s dislike its video
It's TIIIIIIIIMMMMMEEEE!!!
Last time I had a proper look at anything AMD was back in 2002 when i bought my first PC with an AMD DURON 1.2GHZ. Finally AMD are fighting back!
RIP 10900K.  AMD 5900 will be the faster gaming CPU in the world.
Thank you AMD for allowing us to use high end quality pc gear at an affordable price!   Now us who are less fortunate can compete whether its gaming or productivity
Take our money and hire a person who can give a proper name to all your products.
good luck Lisa! We believe in you!
Lisa please dont hold back Ryzen 5 cpus too long for us budget gamers.I would hate to wait another month for a Ryzen 5 5600 budget champ.
Those 25 dislikes are by scared Intel fanboys...
Hopefully Zen 3 + RDNA 2 laptops soon
You make the besz processors! Thank for you AMD !
This is Best day in whole year 🤓
Respect for Lisa Su
Be the fastest so I can get my bro a 4700/5700X for Christmas instead of a... intel 10800K? Intel ik u can see this, ur cpu naming sucks.
The 300 dislikes that’s not the like button
At last.i am waiting for this
Power is coming 👊🏻
Waiting to build new rig
I can't wait for the new 5000 series chips.     Then I can afford a Ryzen 1600.
its the kryptonite to intel
I am really satisfied to choose ryzen 5 3550h Asus gaming notebook couple of months ago and I am impressed by the performance given by that chip at such a cheap price ☺️ .  The last thing that I always wondered was if ryzen mobile processor were not in the market we were getting those dual core i5 chips at cost of i7 these days 😂😂
Amd rocks
Ayayaya
Intel is the best, you don't need to justify this is the truth
Cant wait for Zen 3 to fire up in my ASUS ROG MOTHERBOARD this will break more records. #Asus #Amd #best
Seems like the last nail in the Intel coffin drops today.
BINOD
LETS GOOOOO
1 year AGO -> AMD Threatened INTEL without focusing on gaming. Now, -> AMD, "Where Gaming Begins".  Intel- I think we should also sell bikes.       xDDDDDDDDd
To all the misogynists out there who think women can't handle 'traditional' men's jobs: *LISA SU SINGLE HANDEDLY PROVES, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THAT A WOMAN, IS JUST AS CAPABLE AS A MAN, IF NOT MORE.*
Please be a 3950x replacement announced 🙌🏻
amd 최고
F for Intel
Ryzen 7 5800x gang??
*"Goodbye Intel"*
OOOooooO
AMD says to Intel: I rise! You fall!
QUERO O ZEN 3 PARA A MINHA X370!!!
*FUN FACT* : "8 October also is the same day when Lisa Su became a CEO of AMD"
Ryzen 3 6/12  ?????????????
Now even ps5 will have AMD Processor
Lets GOOOO AMD!!! Good on you guys for the last 3 years of CPU development!  "Today is a great day for AMD, a great day to all fellow PC gamers. Today is beginning of a new, era, the dawn of an AMD revolution, and from this day forward, ALL OF THE PC MASTER RACE, WILL REMEMBER THIS, AS THE LAST DAY OF INTEL CORPORATION!!!"  Wish Lisa Su and all AMD employees good health. Long live Lisa Su, she loves you.
Give us Thunderbolt 3/4 on all desktop AMD boards and all laptops and we will take you seriously. Remember, for gaming too, Thunderbolt enables eGPU. It is not something to be ignored on the AMD platform.
can't wait
Zen3 FTW, I hope Big Navi also comes out shaking nVidia
I have a b450i strix , gonna wait until new bios comes
Intel to gio
Please 5GHz+ frequency
Can't wait to buy a new ryzen 7 this month
Don't increase the price
Can’t wait to switch to amd!
Probably the most exciting processor launch yet.
Waiting Since last 5 months..😍

1.4 intel fanboiss 😂😂😂
AMD has Ryzen from the ashes
WHOO!!!!!!!
amd: focuses on gaming     intel: avengers boxed processors
Yay!
glad I waited
I wonder how Intel is going to try to spin this.  Sure AMD's CPUs are faster than ours in every way and cost the same or less.  But our CPUs "just work". lol
AMD YES
Ik the ryzen 3 zen 3 havent been announced yet, but I cant wait till it does
God bless AMD
Мы, русские хакеры, с нетерпением ждем новые процессоры АМD
AMD YES!
Going to be interesting to see if AMD can finally dethrone Intel as the king of gaming...at least until 2021.
I will wait for zen 3
ryzen 7 5700x with RX5700xt
Today is the date of death Intel
I desperately want to see 5800x performance. If it's a good as leaks, it will replace my 2600.
22 dislikes by Intel fan boys feeling bad for intel only 22 fan boys 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Unless you really need a PC right now, why would anybody build a new AMD rig this year when AM5 is right around the corner?
💵🖥️⌨️🖱️
People disliking are probs shintel fanboys
Intel- Dead From Inside😂

I hope they will give some tease of big Navi...
20 dislikes were intel staff knowing they're about to lose their jobs.
The 20 peeps that dislike dont like the description of '' Where Gaming Begins" because they are intel fanboys
Hmm, AMD dont make me regret buying your processors now.
Goodbye intel Edit: cause' you are too pricey 😭
GET KEEN FOR STONKS
Y didn't you just launch GPU as well. I don't know still how long I have to wait to build a PC damn

🥰😘love you AMD so much
Will they release ryzen 3s or 5s? By the end of 2020?
Can't wait to see radeon+ryzen beat In+nv.
Meanwhile over at the competitors... Intel: Let's stay positive everyone and repeat after me... "I'm blue daba dee daba daa" AMD: The competition sound like Helmut Marko in Formula 1... all positively blue yet green with envy.
Lisa i can't even eat..... so excited wanna see what Zen 3 will do 😌😎😎.😍😍😍
AMD is 💓
AMD: Let the bodies hit the floor.
RIP Intel la

Hello peeps
It's show time
긴장감을 놓칠 수 없군요... 리사수는 과연 용팔이 프리미엄을 붙여도 싼 가격이 나올까요? 또한 성능은 어떨까요. 내일 알아봐야지
Just love rysen
OM Shanti Intel
imagine disliking it before it begins
Those 16 people who disliked this video are from intel office.
intel who?
AMD's moral of the story :  This is what happens when you under estimate your opponent or don't take your opponent seriously
AMD FTW
It’s over 5000!
C'mon Amd Surprise us again!!!...
AMD YES !!!
Intel :- we are the gaming king   AMD :- Hold My Beer
I hope she will share a little info about big navi
Oh yeahhhh
I impulsively bought a R5 3600 earlier this year that I can't use yet, if one of these new processors is anywhere near the same price as it I will cry myself to sleep, but also be very excited.
$200 cpu please or $400 flu when that launches that’s literally the best spot that ninvida hasn’t touched
eagerly waiting🤨
Going to buy this proceesor and b550 motherboard
11PM when this live in my place. I'll watch this anyways
Unleash the Zen! :D
I hope they at least launch the 5600x
Pleaseee introduce ryzen 5000 apu aswell,or tease em We itx builders need more capable apu these days
Good luck.
Hype.  Keep making us money AMD! (and taking it because I'm definitely upgrading)  The FX days are over it's all Zen from here!
13 intel workers
Viewing this now a 3950X seems slow😂😛
Awesome
Yeah, it's time!
pog pog pog
We love u Lisa!
I want zen3 to have higher clocks and fps in gamming
Omg 😃😃😃😃 5th gen
I'll tell my kids," And that,is how Intel died"
PC gamers rocking with their $700 rtx 3080 vs people who bought the 2080 ti for $1200
Gaming is all good and fine, but why are amd and intel specifying gaming explicitly as its only to play games? There are other stuff as well right? Not to be harsh or something, im so damn excited
i want the amd ryzen 5900x to upgrade my i7 7700k
Hopping for a new awsome  apu ❤️
Ryzen ❤️
Hurry up and release already! I need me a 5900x so my son can have my 3900x.  His PC is built and simply waiting for the CPU.
Can't wait for the old cpu prices to drop :)))
Mic drop moment, let's do it....  Also a "one more thing" moment at the end with an unspecified GPU running Doom Eternal at close to 1000 FPS.
A M 1 : 0 0　(JAPAN)
Hi World!!!)
Wow that was a great event. I'm definitely going to get the Ryzen 8 5770X
This is what happens when you realize even linux hates intel btw I am excited!😁
Omg, cant wait for this
The future is today, old man  El futuro es hoy, viejo
Can’t wait to have it with a rtx3080
I'm just here for new apu
Ry'zen' and 'zen' See the relation?
Veamos que tal, ojalá que tengamos un buen aumento de rendimiento.
i don't buy ryzen 3600 yet, i hope i take the right decision
That 12 dislike are from intel videos actors and choreographer.
“Where Gaming Begins” LOL THEY AINT PLAYIN
Brasil is AMD!
3080 competitor at $500
intel倒闭倒计时
Intel is falling, AMD has Ryzen
I hope they remember you intel
Can't wait, when Ryzen 5000 and RDNA 2 will come out in my country, past Gen gpu and cpu prices will go down, and I finally can buy Ryzen 5 3600 + RX 5700 XT =)
Lisa!!! ive waited so long for this!!! pinched my self to be more patient and not buy Zen 2 for my PC build, the wait is OVER
No a empezado y ya están dando dislike típico de  fanboy de intel que asco
Amd is best
AMD for lifeeee Intels counting there last breath
Are you ready guys.
Lisa su is the best
Waiting for benchmarks to decide if i go 10600k or 5700x Edit: im not bias agianst any company I just buy the best preformance per dollar
I’m sooooo hype
It's happening boys. Where were you when AMD processors beat Intel ones in gaming? I was here.
RYZEN RYZEN RYZEN
LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOO
AMD: focuses on gaming    le INTEL: time for a new logo
Hours - 13 "Still Waiting"
RIP intel
Asu mecha 😐

Aahhh new Intel Core I. Finaly.
Thumbs up if you already know what you're gonna see.
18 core flagship ryzen 9? Excited to find out 🎉 Now just a lovely 13h wait;)
This video should play relaxing songs first so we can sleep.
I just love AMD nowadays AMD: New era of gaming starts here            With ZEN 3 INTEL: Its time we make our new               LOGO 😂.....14nm+++++++
my poor desttop getting olddd....
RIP for everyone was using 3000 ryzen or 5700xt 5700, is time to upgrad right now.
Can't wait
POGCHAMP
I am a 3700x customer. intel inside kidney outside
Hi people. This is a person from the AMD company. Thanks for all the support. Hope you all like this new processor.            JK. Just Kidding
Cant wait...
*Я в истории!*
Ooo baby
I ordered ryzen 5 2600 and gtx 1650 super some days ago
Let's just say that it's prices will be similar to ryzen 3 3100 .( Fingers crossed) 🤞🤞🤞🤞
Intel has fallen, AMD has Ryzen.
AMD is about showing why Intel is falling further behind, Intel is losing in gaming....... a market what they led 10 years with iron fist. Intel needs to start with a blank piece of paper. Jim Keller left because Intel did not listen to what he had to say.
For the 10 intel guys who disliked:  Do you know why I hate intel? I remember something called intel hd graphics (even intel guys must accept .nothing's worse)
my body and my x570 aorus extreme is ready.
Mommy Su!
Dislikes from INTEL fanbois 🙃
Still now it's hard to find Ryzen 4000 series in productivity laptops .
"where gaming begins"?  Oh ho hoo, the table is set for a very nice launch for me.
bruh lisa su boutta flex on intel with this presentation
I already have a ryzen 5 3600 which performs perfectly :) Will wait and see what comes along i guess.
Ryzen 1xxx and 2xxx dug the grave, 3xxx and 4xxx pushed Intel into it, and 5xxx will probably bury them. And it did. What could I have expected?
We wish Lisa Su good health and all the best from Ukraine.
lessssgooooo
Finally I can lay my i3 7100 to rest 😌🥺
I hope the prices should be low
This is truly a great time to be a pc gamer. So many options. We have come a long way from the days of the i7 7700k...
Who else is going to watch this on a AMD based pc?
"You're tearing *my wallet* apart, Lisa!"
Impress me AMD so I can make a new build in a  month with these CPUs and PCI-E 4.0
History in the making... This is the moment intel dies. Intel's last stand of single-core performance, Will end today. The lesson here: Never take yourself too seriously always evolve or you will one day be obsolete and intel.
The excitement builds with every second of suspense.
Hebat AMD
In my place its 8 now
5 nanometros
Can’t wait for the new Ryzen chips!
I hate 2pm lunches I wanna see live!!!!!!!
Right as my school starts Unlucky
Lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo you like my 5000 o

Can't wait ryzen 9 9900 will render cinebench as a game engine.
Intel: NOOOOOOOOO you can't put out CPU that are reasonably priced and are most of the time better than ours amd: ha ha zen 3 go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
5800X here I come. Anything past the 8 core limit for the chiplet in Zen 3 is going to be the same latency issue we have now. So 5800X is what I am getting 👍
can't wait to grab a 5950X!
5900x the one I've been waiting for!
The dislikes is intel,intel fanbois,intel staffs because because they are getting ripped by Threadripper and ryzen 5000 series
Nothing but Respect to Dr. Lisa Su
6 dislike from Intel fanboys Edit: 61 now
IM READY FOR A EXCITING FALL AS A GAMER
AMD packing HEAT. 🐐
Rip Intel
Call holders where we at. 10/16 $90c
Bye Intel :D
Isn’t this meant to be an international company? It’s just a bit old school using local time as it is already 9 October in some parts of the world. A true international company should be using the timeline not local time
I have the Amd a10 7860k 😂 I need a upgrade
Let's go Mamma Su.
I bought AMD stock at 4 bucks a share I’m laughing all the way to retirement.
Can't wait to buy, hope AMD can provide pre order!!!
Can you hear that?   It's Intel's CEO shitting himself
​Thank you AMD for making high performance computing affordable! Typing from my Ryzen 9 4900HS G14.
So it's official. It's called the 5000 series.
Intel: How have you beaten me?? 😵 AMD: Hahaha this isn't even my final form. 😃
Imagine being in the live chat.
Please please relesea something that outpeforms 10900k in gaming while also has 12 core 24 threads. I've been holding out to upgrade my pc for so long. 3900x was so tempting. I need a beast cpu to pair with 3080. So please please don't let me down amd. Although you guys never do:)
Wait Ryzen 5600!
Ryzen
I hope everyone is staying safe & doing well during this COVID-19.       Please bring (AMD Ryzen 5000 Series) it to 'Malaysia', Lisa Su. TQ
Can't wait to see it

I need a new strong ryzen 7 to boost my rtx 3070 . Fok amd gpus they suck cuz cuda cores and tensor cores ftw for all apps beaides gaming.oh and new nvec
instant noodle for 2 months again😗
AMD I have been with you since Thuban cores. I am excited to see the performance of the 3300X translate into the main stack that are the 600 to 900 series chips. I have been with TR4 (absolutely love X399) but you did a lot of your core customers a disservice when you priced the sTRX40 chips into the stratosphere. What hurts about that is that Strx40 boards are not overpriced for what you get vs "mainstream" high end board. Please give us a 12 core Strx40 (3940X wired like a 3300X) chip to allow us X399 users that are just enthusiasts can enjoy the benefits of PCIe 4.0. If there is one difference between PCIe 4.0 vs 3.0 is that I find a (Vega 64 vs 5700)(X570 vs X399) GPU runs at higher clocks using  4.0 vs 3.0 allowing for a much nicer experience overall for everything but PCIe is where it is at for me you can blame 990FX as I have not seen a Am4 board to rival my Sabretooth 990FX in terms of wiring. I don't want to miss the party though so I built myself a X570 Media PC that pushes my 165hz 1440p monitor quite nicely. 165 Freesync premium is something that has to be experienced to appreciate. I have had the blessing to be able to save enough marbles to update my 3600 as I absolutely fell in love with the 3300X. So maybe the 5700x may be in my radar but I still want my sub $1000 Strx chip!
Here Comes a New Challenger
Amd wins
Here we go!!
I’m so hyped for 5900 xt
RIP INTEL  RIP INTEL RIP INTEL  RIP INTEL RIP INTEL  RIP INTEL  Yes I am an AMD Fanboy LOL
Shits gonna get real. Brace your bum Intel
I am excited for this launch, which I can't afford 😗😗🤨
Haven't seen Lisa in a long time, need a fix!
I have a bad feeling that this year AMD processor is going to be expensive... Ryzen7 5800 is going to be $400...
I can’t wait!
I've been waiting all week for this. Let's hope AMD keeps on being competitive for the entire PC industry.
My OCD brain is hurting looking at  ZEN    3
Hope to snag a Ryzen 9 5900X for my new PC I am building (meanwhile no luck in getting an RTX 3080).
As long as there's a bios update for the nearly 400$ x570 board I bought, I'm happy.
That one dislike is Intel.
Let's go to win!
omg it's not even gone live yet and look at the likes! I'm badly waiting for the show 😍
thought it was 12PM Eastern.. that's what their site says
how the hell am i suppose to sleep tonight LISA!
the reason I'm still desperate to finish college so I can just buy it on my own
I can’t wait for this to kick off!

AMD: Zen 3 Me: I know I can't buy it but I'm still excited

I hope we get some info on Zen 3 Threadripper, too.  👍

Surprise me! This year is time to update my PC. Nvidia show up his tools. Now I hope AMD bring something to let me choose his product.
Gaming is the focus. RIP Intel!
