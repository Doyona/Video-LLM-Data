"If I was his Manager I would drag him to the training ground and throw his boots at him ! "
He stopped to have a cup of tea.
what if he was just hiding in the back of Dele's car?
who cares really.. most overrated, overpriced player of all time
No other media outlet can milk something like a player not arriving to training like Sky Sports.
Sensational lol must be short off news.
As a Spurs fan, we are definitely not going to force Harry Kane to stay, he is not the only attacker in Tottenham,  we have best attackers  like Son, Lucas, Gill and even if he goes we can still be among the best in Europe. I bet Harry Kane living us will be the greatest  mistake in his life bcz this time we are going to win sometin big. So to me let him go.
Spurs can make Phil Jones feel like ambitious and force his way out 😂😂😂🤣🤣
Sky crap reporting again.
paul;s mom is everywhere
they took harry kane loyalty to the club for his weakness. let the man go!
Wonder if the same will happen if I don't turn up for work today
0:53:Imagine if that was Kane’s car
He reminds me of my friend who bunks school when he is unhappy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m a city fan so this a good situation for me
Funny if he's just late cuz he's dropping the kids off at the pool
He deserves a better team than Tottenham.
what a load of crap, talk about overselling this so-called news.
I remember when Neymar didn't show up for training but that's non of my business
There something rotten at the club for the last 20 years and it’s not the players nor it’s the coaches.
It's now or never for Harry Kane tbh....
Yeah obviously ! I couldn’t find the fuel cap on my Tesla yeah obviously !
He was with wain Rooney 😊
Imagine the outrage if Pogba did this
Let the man free
I recall the same with Courtois at Chelsea. I can understand that Madrid is a more prestigious club but the way he handled that was just terrible. I like that Kane gave Spurs prior notice and Spurs still have a month remaining before the transfer window deadline.
His GPS goes haywire. 😊
Hes one of our owwwwnnn.. D'OH.......
We all have a sick day from time to time 😂😂
Good. I'm with Harry 100%. Kane is not worth 160million at his age - the price is what the market is willing to pay. Kane has given his all but he's reached the end of the road at Tottenham
If this was Pogba or Sterling.......the media and English pundits would've destroyed them!!!!
Levy gonna hold him in cage. He has still contract left and Levy not gonna let him go.
How is this breaking news
Why do both Sky Sports News and Sky Sports Football post football-related news clips? Highly confusing.
I did not sleep with carmen electra last night. I must ve going to city
will the real Harry please show up..🤣🤣
Harry is got to be worth at least £200m , look at his goals and assists, and he can also take corners, and given his aerial and ball playing ability, he can play as a center-back as well.  Then add another few quid as he is English, British and the captain. So, in all, around £250m (more than Ajax's WHOLE budget), anything less is an absolute bargain 😅😅
He went to a brothel with rooney and fell asleep
It’s like the old saying goes ‘can’t do the time don’t sign on the dotted line’ or something like that 🤔
I don’t care how frustrated he is with the club it’s unacceptable to disrespect your club, teammates and fans by not turning up to training. Wake up Spurs fans a man who loves your club wouldn’t do this.
When Eriksen, Bale, Modric left at least they were going abroad to respected clubs in Inter & Real. Not the oil merchants in the same league we compete in.
I don't blame harry kane for not turning up for training levy is holding harry kane like a hostage does not want harry kane to leave when he wants a new challenge in his career harry kane has done all he can for spurs and kane knows its time to move on for a new challenge
Why all the ramblings, is he not on holidays...Oops! Just saw him at the Emirate😜
Blinkers.... are.... off...!!🕶... harry boy!! Gets,,, real!!...🎶🎵as the,,, Comunards...’ sang,,!!... Dont,,, Levey,,,, this,,,WAY!!🎵🎶,,😹
Finished club
Good
Sky sports with another great non story
I hope he's signing for united
His car broke down. I was with him. He later used Bus 25 to the training ground so it’s not breaking news.
Doesn't matter
He deserves a club where he can win cups. He's given a lot to Spurs.
He was pinged so had to self isolate for ten days 😂😂  He forgot his mask 😷 had to go back home  He was watching the Olympic Games on the swimming on how to be a better diver 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Loooool they loaned in Gareth Bale and all he did was give Kane ideas about how to force a move out of the club! 😭😭😭😭
This is my favorite story right now. The most over rated footballer on earth won't go practice for the most underachieving football club of all time. Sexy sexy stuff.
He was scheduled to come back this Friday
SUBSCRIBE TO @KENYAN COMEDY TV FOR HOT ADULT VIDEOS
The club is in a mess. There's always some  psycho drama being played out with  player signings or players leaving with this club and we are fed up with it. Why can't this club just be run in a normal way.Harry Kane not turning up for training now Hugo loris doing the same thing. History is repeating  it's self . The same thing happened with modric and bale when they left . Levy is playing hard balls he is holding out for £200million from Man City ,just take the £160 and move on . Kane is seeing player after player leaving and is thinking why isn't he allowed to go. Total mismanagement by this chairmen and board
Good 👍
He was never due in, he’s due in tomorrow. True story.
To get trophy 🏆
I am sick to DEATH of the English media and Harry Kane, they can both do one. Absolute CLOWNS! Rant about this on my channel if you're interested.
He’s trying to force a move back to his boyhood club. Once a gooner always a gooner
He going man city it’s obvious
He is trying to force a move to Celtic 😂😂😂😂
.
Unprofessional and disgraceful. So called England's gem 👎🏿
Sky News breaking news:  " Harry Kane did not arrive to training because he was PINGed by the NHS app to isolate! "
BREAKING SENSATIONAL NEWS! Man is not at a place.
It's simple if you make an agreement with the player that he can leave this season and go back on your words not good..
Another waste of space who thinks hes bigger than the club.  Overrated toss pot
Could be a family emergency geez hardly breaking news if not and he is doing this stupid no show grow sum balls and hand in a transfer request dont  disrupt preseason
Bigger news than 9/11. Shocking
he probably just forgor 💀
I swear the English media really overhype their players Especially over this guy. I mean so what if he doesn't turn up training. How is this SENSATIONAL news? Why is this trending on YouTube and Google search? How many balloon d'or's and trophies did this guy even win? Whenever he has the ball or so much as just passing the ball, the English commentators make such a big deal out of it as if he did something otherworldly, it's laughable.  Sterling did more for England than this guy did and he gets half the credit.Then there's grealish who costs 100mil lol, are you kidding me? He's nowhere near that. Ever since the euros, all of sudden all the England players cost almost a 100mil lol. Fasten you're seat belts guys because this is BREAKING, SENSATIONAL, ASTONISHING news coming you're way.
Hey did you know this news was sensational?
He’s still in a field on his knee.
He'll be back tomorrow
The guy wants to join a big club and win trophies, not a small club that dodges them.
Don't worry about it, l blow off work all the time..
My dad just told me this so I came to search it up and it was on top
spurs should have let him go he deserve to play better team
Harry you are not that guy’s kid, stupid. Your dad is not Paul, or D, or old man. Because if you were their kid, you would not be enough to counter the plot.
What a captain what an insperation, smh!! You have a contract bro and get paid a fortune
He knows it is now or never to leave to win anything over nothing
I hate Tottenham
It's now or never, can't really blame him.
Harry Kane in bed with COVID 19- Jesus I don’t think I can go to training today Sky sports- HARRY KANE IS GOING TO CITY!
OOOOOH the drama, give it a break , not the first guy in the world to say sod it on first monday after a holiday
I my opinion this is nothing but just destroying the transfer market. When all the clubs around the world are struggling to pay wages, city spends 200 mil on players easily. And tbh its not just city all the premier league clubs are doing it. Anyone can reach CL finals after spending this much amount of money, while all the traditionally run clubs are nothing but just feeders to these oil merchants.
Short holiday….he had 3 weeks off!
BREAKING : Employee didn't report for work
He’s in fortnite
Kane has to look out for himself because no one else will. Gotta do what you need to.
get a proper job dick head
Didn't know you had to train programme sellers..... So this is why you is a top team....
Even Paul was left in the dark on this one
I juat spotted him racing up the m6 too manchester...singing blue moon and a kevin de bruyne t shirt on
Everything with Sky is "breaking news" isn't it.
Daniel Levy should just let him go. The guy is too greedy, in the current corona climate no one will pay 150+ for Harry Kane. Just cash in and give the greatest player of the last 30 years for spurs his wish
Proper overrated player
Oh noes whats happened!
Looks like Harry Kane is not coming ome  lol
I remember a player done something like this for West Ham a few years back can’t remember his name but he got blasted by the media even heard people in the media say put him in the under 23s team till his contract finishes but now Kane has done the same I don’t hear the same energy it is cause Kane is England’s captain? Let’s see how the media down play the disrespect move Kane has done smh
how about he leaves?
He shouldn't go back there. It's not like they even bought him for any fee.
Them crunchy nut cornflakes, they are just too nice.
Boohoo get a fecking life, ya children.
hes out looking for a trophy . he definitely wouldnt find one driving through them spurs gates
Harry Kane hasnt turned up, he arrives during the report, so they cut it off cuz LOL
Will Kane refuse to turn up to the next England training session , due to the  lack of success of his country , he would want to change nationality to give him a better chance of winning a major trophy ??
He’s got a letter from his mum saying he has to miss PE. !!
Gentlemens agreement or not , he's still employed by THFC , and he's obligated to turn up for work .
Contract or not, if he don't want to play , he's not going to, he's not gonna be at his best for Tottenham so let him go, he deserves to move, we can't offer him what he deserves , end of.
If true , Kane started with the last resort , if he wants to leave that badly , he has just disrespected THFC , his colleagues , and stuck 2 fingers up at his idolising Spurs fans , disgraceful behaviour , akin to a spoilt 8 year old child that has to get his way ,  and not  the England captain .
Show the money, better players have gone
Hi might of overslept 🤣
Bless him, he was really gearing up for a big speech, ah well.
Gentleman's agreement means nothing to Levy.
Hard to believe but he might just end up with Chelsea 😂
Get a life Sky Sports.
Still hiding in that place he found each time we got to a final...lol 2 lge cup finals 1 champions league final awol.
Levy should let him leave. England captain has got to play Champions League. Period.
All the spurs fans saying that Kane wouldn't down tools ,🤣🤣🤣🤣
When City want a player, we get a player simple. No remorse.
Imagine being on "Harry Kane watch"...
Maybe he has a dentists appointment. 😐
Come to Chelsea
Come to Chelsea
If managers can resign, players should have the right to resign too.
ENIC OUT.  Stand up if you hate levy
It shame going to city just to look for a trophy if he want to earn respect he should have went to Real Madrid or other teams to win trophies
Now this nice guy B.S about Kane the media push can stop...... same for son....
I wouldn’t either if i played like he did in the euros
Players should respect their contracts, when players suck, the clubs have to respect the contract, if Harry wants to leave, just play out the contract and leave.
Idiots, maybe he has a family problems.... Why do you think that this is a sign of signing?
Fernando llorente has had more important moments for spurs than Harry kane
The image went dark when they realized that he was arriving to camp... Turns out he had a flat tire.
Am I missing something? Perhaps he’s not feeling well today, and will be in tomorrow??
I can only imagine skipping training to make a point, will only make someone like levy dig deeper to keep him at the club. But we will see.
Sky absolutely loving it!!
Yeah Kane is really serious now about his career and winning titles, best move he has made because he's not getting any younger!
Let the games begin...
My guy Harry Kane probably not happy to be at Tottenham. Fully understandable and I think he wants to go where better opportunities are since he shows he is one of the best player in football. Its a good move. Im glad he answers in silence because that shows power and resilience to what makes you unique and want for the better outcomes. Keep doing your thing Harry and do what makes you happy at the end of the day!
Why the hell?? Kane should go to training and love Spurs where he spend most of his career.  😆  the media and England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 fans want him to win a trophy so badly dwl
😳🥺😪😭
Probably went to Manchester or something!!!
Free harry kane
On strike probably
Welcome to Manchester Harry
go to juve and you will win the league and then come back
:D
Maybe he overslept..
let him go hes average as heck anyway lol
Sensational news? Millionaire throws a tantrum is not sensational news
Spurs you have  no ambition  just take the  money and  let him go
oh oh he wants a tittle
Tottenham should do the right thing and let him go
Man City incoming ⚽️🏆
He'll be back tomorrow! I think he was making a statement! He obviously knows Levy...who on the basis of millions more or inflated figure will prolong or not even sell even to the detriment of our club. We have been mighty lucky to have Kane these last years!
Man is just gaming is all.
Make him train  with the u 23s and halve his wages
Nice video mate!  As a trader, I have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to choosing sides, though i am not kicking against hodlin, but i see it as an old and odd strategy to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors/traders loses their investment which is always painful, when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from a professional trader that do get tips & understand the market and use strategy to generate signals daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as i have been doing with francishunt for the past 3 weeks and I have been able to day trade to grow my initial 3.2 btc to 12 btc which you will rethink and see that trading is more better/profitable. Steve van meter is very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment.  He can be reached on TELEGRAM (Stevevan) to join his program.
BREAKING NEWS: today is monday!
The Tottenham triangle Harry goes missing and then it claims the Sky reporter , Scary.
Harry kane ran him over

Breaking News its been reported he is not home from holiday yet he's stuck at the airport
Funniest host ever 👻🤸‍♂️ ..
Told u he would down tools
Maybe hes on holidays
Imagine if it's just Kanes day off
Still on holiday
Omg.   The sniper killed the reporter.
daniel levy probably cut off the feed
He totally deserves to move on.
The reporter was cut off because he couldn’t answer a simple question and proceeded to make the most of his “air time” by waffling about stuff that wasn’t relevant lol that’s what’s hilarious about this interview
levy is just spoiling a mans achievement.
Love how Sky had a problem with Pogba wanting to leave but if it’s Kane leaving Spurs then it’s OK ……
Maybe he thought he was supposed to be in tomorrow.
If Pep pays 100 million for him after the Euro games it would be a Miracle. Think nobody would stump up 100 million for him.
All this fuss, and all that’s happened is that he got pinged!! Haha
Imagine throwing a sneaky sickie after a heavy weekend and it being on the news.
Sensational developments 🙄even the camera man got fed up and cut him off 😂
Really breaking sensational news 📰 flights are stopped nation is waiting and covid is taking a break
The England captain should be Declan Rice .
I’m sure he just arrived like an hour ago 😂
Imagine if this was Pogba the world would of ended. Gary Neville knows nothing “oh no he’s such a professional the move won’t effect him” ye ye piss off
I actually think he was in the bathroom 🤣😂🤣
So many sour Tottenham fans I love it😭😭you're clubs been pushing above it's weight for a while...my only sadness is that Son has to stay there too
Levy gave Kane the “Gentleman’s Handshake” with his fingers crossed 🤣🤣🤣 Levy is tooo sly
hopefully hes okay
That is the only way spit Daniel Levy on the face. He is greedy and ungrateful.
Sensational? Might be for a gooner like u
Legend has it it was Harry kane himself who snook up on the reporter and turned his camera off at the end 😳
""" Paul has not shown up, he was expected to show up and continue the press conference but as we speak Paul 😉 has not shown up""" Paul ghosted like Harry Kane at the end of the vidoe hahahaha
He may have had an induction at the job centre you never know 😂
He should get a massive fine and a ban for the disrespect he has shown his club and they should sell him to a league one club for a £5
Hahaha as expected. It's gonna be another Messi. I don't think anyone has them in their plans and he'll be forced to play for spurs again next season
It's not really breaking news and sensational. FFS calm down. Meanwhile, Kane has been lapping it up in Bahamas and is now chilling at home with a whiskey sour 😂 (Harry looks like a whiskey sour drinker. I think he was a mojito boy, which he pronounced 'mo-he-toe', but changed over the years).
1000 comment
Indeed it is getting quite Messi
He's at mine on bag mate he'll be in, in the morning
He's been held hostage by mediocrity long enough.
He’s just knocked off a couple million off his price tag, levy should’ve let him go sooner
He's been kidnapped by the Illuminati.
How much did this just cost sky sports to report someone pulling a “sickie”? Well guess that’s where all the sky subscribers monies go!
Not really a shock calm down we all knew he wanted out
Obviously yeah Spurs are ass holes for saying they’ll let him leave the next season then pretending that they didn’t say that at all. However, Kane made a contractual agreement at his job. We’d all be expected to honour that agreement to any employer
Hi
Who would?
Maybe he’s got flu
There is a lot of imagines. I think Harry Kane doesn’t want to come in today because he doesn’t want to. Or he just want to pull a dembele.
This is hardly sensational news.
The Thumbs Down icon was created for this level of journalism.
Small club 😂
holy hell the sensationalism from "reporters" over these transfers. These reporters must be great jazz artists, with the way they leave out notes to make things sound "sensational". Harry Kane has not "YET" shown up to training. Also, going live at 9:00am to say that someone hasn't met their deadline of 10:30am is not "breaking news". Nor is reporting at 10:31 either.
Just let him go Levy
I didnt think he had balls to do this fair pay harry
😂😂😂😂😂sky  😂😂😂😂😂
It's a Monday morning his probley hung over from the weekend bender give hima brake 🤣 !
Harry just turned up off camera and cancelled the camera man .
Ita because he wants to leave but the greedy owners want too much money for him. 160m in a pandemic... imagine if we wasn't in a pandemic... Levy would probably asking for a share in man City football club plus 200m lol
I suppose he has better things to do than to train with Tottenham, I know I would.
Messi :I have gentle man agreement Bortamu : 😂 what agreement   Kane : I have gentle man agreement Levi : 😆 what are you talking about
He's gone to Iceland. Good deals on pizzas today.
Kane knows it's now or never for him to win trophies. Levy should've honoured his agreement with him that he would be allowed to leave. Sometimes you gotta take things into your own hands even if it's not the best way to go about it
Harry kane wants to leave for trophy.let him go
Kane will end up at psg not city or any other English club
Kane yea I will sign a long term contract 😀  Kane 2021: Let me go please 🥺  Levi : No baby 🥺 you still have 3 year's left in your contact    Levi again : Ok if you want to go then tell Manchester City to pay 160 million and some players too 😆
Harry Kane feeling that 🧂 in the wounds after witnessing Manchester City going in for Jack Grealish and I do not blame him he will not achieve anything at tight ass Spurs!
Zero respect from these millionaire players anymore, under contract means nothing at all
His English lesson was running late
Kane is on another level to Grealish, screw 100m
He’s just been holiday probably isolating after coming-back get some proper-news
Good job to the editor
It would make sense if he had 2 yrs left on his contract, not 3 yrs. No pressure on Levy yet.
We will always love you Harry, sad it's come to this.  Shame on you Levy 👎  I hope the 9 fans at Man City make you feel welcome
Will city spend 100m on grealish and 100m on kane?
Keep the league interesting Harry and go to Man Utd
Ole out
Even if Kane does want to move you don't act like that,Very unprofessional
Spurs need to cash in
Did you guys check City’s training ground?
Thanks sky sports,I was really concerned about this but  by all means keep us up to date 😉
Waiting for Darren Farley to tell us more
I think even the producer was like... "Jesus, cut this lad off from talking nonsense"   "Sensational" without knowing the context of his absence
He was in the back of Peter Odemwingie's car on the way to Loftus Road.
He forgor
This headline makes it sound like he's been kidnapped.
Hectic 👀👀👀 😂😂😂😂😂
It was his first time calling in to explain but the receptionist couldn't understand him & hung up.
Rumour has it, Harry is parked up outside QPR's Loftus Road.
Way to start Monday. Jeez
Reporter says Harry Kane hasn't shown up for 2 minutes straight. Fixed your title
Sensational ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Nuno trolling sky sports already
He's wasting his best years with tot.. he shud have left.. last year or the year before.. just wasting his time there.  Tot are desperate..
He doesn’t turn up to training  Reporters: this is sensational news Harry Kane could literally be doing anything 😂
Turns out he was on the toilet
🤣🤣🤣🤣....he wants to leave the sinking ship
Kane had a Gentleman's agreement with Levy that he could leave if things didn't work out in the last Season and Levy has tried to renege. Kane has every right to force the move. Spurs should sell him for whatever they can get and be happy for it. He has given them the benefit of the doubt for more than was required of him. Spurs can rebuild with the cash.
He is resting after Euros, Harry Maguire not returned yet either.
there goes paul
Cheers, Son’s crying. Nice one Kane
nice lacy bra there from the host
Kane Wife called up and Harry Kane is just quarantine.
Was he in the merc
Very simple , If I was Kane I would show up, train, not say much to the media  And… during game time, I would score own goals and play very poor…. To stick it to Levy
He probably drove to the etihad like odemwinge
Either he leaves or not - but this is not what I would call a professional?
omg this is sensational unexpected trivializing nail biting news but he was just getting a coffee
He’s gone 😂 he must’ve had an epiphany other night and realised it’s time to win a trophy elsewhere lol
Media basis is ridiculous if Pogba did the same everyone would of called him mercenary
if this was Neymar, Suarez , or some foreign players people/pundit will talk it up as being disrespectful and a disgrace. English players? nah he's a winner. the same thing with diving, when English players dive it is street smart and wise, Kane is a diver and now he's being a disgrace lets call a spade a spade. this goes way back to Gerrard and Rooney too.
Levy's kidnapped him!
Only Harry Kane would have signed a 6 year contract until he’s 31 any big player would have managed this situation properly so they’re not trapped
He has a hangover geez
One line news... dragged into 5 mins. Like he said it like 4 times
He’s stopped off at Starbucks.
i thought he was going to Man City as a sure thing
Imagine if he forgot to set his alarm clock.
thats my boy lol.
Imagine if he took a uber and ended up in the wrong training centre.
Thing is Levy should have a pair and put him with the kids and refuse to sell him.
Pretty standard if the deal is further down the line then what is being publicly known the club thats interested in him has more than likely stipulated he is not train  ... at this point he is pretty much a 120 million plus commodity they are lookin to invest in.
Hes off with the kids.
What? What? Harry? Top class pro. Model pro.Great bloke. Role model. Loyal. Has not turned up to work? No, no. Not the narrative. Perhaps he is protecting his mental health. Yes, that is the line. It’s OK, Harry’s reputation is in tact!
thats him in the background cutting the hedge thats his job for the day
Kane, don’t cost me points.  I have you in my fantasy Premier League team
hahaha he has got the shits thats all
He probably had diarrhea and had messaged nuno already...
Best bit was the cut
We all know this would be very different if it was pogba
I think he just over slept.
Woah Sky! This is so big. Are you sure that only one reporter is enough?
Arsenal bids 200mil for kane
if city get kane then thats madness imagine how many goals he can score with all the chances city create thats on thing they miss their conversion rate is not the best imo they need kane more then grealish
That Merc was driving out!
I bet Kane and his agent wanted a clause in the last contract he signed, Levy probably gave him his word and changed his mind. Now Kane's being called unprofessional because he's been stitched up
Levy disconnected his broadcast cord 😂
Jack Turned Up and Is  Training Well with The Villa UTV
he got severed diarrhea. of course he cant go training. smh
Moment of silence for every so called “ pundit “ who said Harry has to much class to not show up and force his way out🤣😂😂, first day doesn’t show up 🤣🤣🤣
Omg harry plizz don't leave the club 🙏😒
BREAKING is meaningless these days.
Kane is on a short holiday
Call the cops
Can't believe sky sports doing a story without the word racism....
i thought england players are still on holiday
Hes came in the back door or his cars broke down pipe down
Go to city Kane
At least he didn't miss a penalty
...here we go. Prepare for Kane to go on strike and become a Pariah at a club he no longer wants to play for or stay at. If only Levy could see this. Tottenham have zero hope of finishing in in the top 4 - they're just not good enough to. Yet Levy clearly (and mistakenly) beloved that with Kane, they still have a chance.   Should have been sold just after the Euros ended.
I'm sorry but i'm not sure why Kane is doing this, i mean he signed  6 YEAR Deal n they werent goin to win any major trophies. They got close as u'd expect but Spurs are paying his wages so this is ridiculous imo
He wants to go . Dont blame him either
Good
I’d be surprised if anybody is prepared to sign him he’s a jinx and going to win sfa
Harry Kane arrived in the beige coloured car. 😭😂
Daniel Levy should pity this dude and let him go to City to have  Trophy to show for his career as one of the best strikers in EPL.
England captain, great role model, stays out the tabloids etc
He might have COVID an been pinged
‘Harry Kane watch’  Have a word with yourself. He’s having a covid test having just returned from holiday
Kane deserves to leave and play in the big games. I hate to see him leave but he does deserve it let him go levy FFS having an unhappy player on the list ain't good for the team let him go and make the camp better
Sky acting as if him missing a training session is on the same level as a Romano "Here We Go"
If it is true, let him rot in the reserves for a season. We will still sell him easily the season after for decent money. It would be worth the money to prove no one is bigger than their club or contract.
talked to much screen went blank
Its not yet time for him to come.  He will Como before the weekend
I'm going to sign a 6-year contract and try to leave because there is a "gentleman's agreement" with Daniel Levy of all people.  It's kind of awkward as well, because if City pay £100m for Grealish, they're not going to go significantly above that for Kane.
In unrealated news , Kane was spotted in Manchester dining with pep
May be he is constipated
Good on him I’m a Spurs fan and Levy is a proper Wanker
Hes gone AWOL. Too bad city chose Grealish and now Kane aint a club to go to looool
He prob has diarrhea he can call in sick if he wants not a big deal I do it all the time where I work
Probably just has diarrhoea leave him alone
Next up,Breaking:Harry Kane is missing
Scholes
Arsenal have a horrible manager and are doing the worst they have been in 40+ years yet spurs still manage to grab the headlines for the wrong reasons 😂
If Foreign players did this they’d get ripped to bits. Typical biased as per!
Imagine if one of us didn't show up for work in this economic  climate.
Nothing to see here..
He's trimming the hedge in the background before training starts
Imagine one of us being late to work one morning was a breaking news story 😂
Let the saga begin
Im sure mans is just sleeping in today. He did have w busy summer after all 😂 😂 😂
Levy is a joke. Kane is leaving. Get your head round it and move on.
I feel for Kane. He doesn't strike me as someone that would do this but it needs to be done
Sack the millionaire prima donner i had to work today
Probably just overslept
Kane really living that motto -  “to dare is to do”
For us here in UAE, Harry Kane deal was done and dusted the day we decided to buy him (Probably around March 2021)
His stuck in Manchester.
Would love PSG, City and Chelsea to flop next season.
Having a "gentleman's agreement" with Daniel Levy is like a rapist having a "gentleman's agreement" to only put the tip in.
Good job Paul did get cut off, he was talking pure waffle towards the end.
What a bs story and a waste of time.  They don't know where he is lol.  Pathetic
Let’s play another classic game of “Where is Harry Kane?”
Have other English players returned
Next news: Harry didn’t go to the toilet
He is in Manchester looking at houses
Imagine if he ends up at United.
"Breaking News"
Levy is digging his heel in. He is obviously holding out for 200million
Kane on the phone to Haaland,' come to Man Utd next season' i will show you the corridors of power.👺
Sensational news lmao..He could have covid ?.. The Kane "Variant"..😂🤣
It’s ok his car broke down
Thought that was him cutting the hedge in the background . 100k p/m
Has Harry Kane shown up for training?
But he’s so professional? He’s such a role model? All I hear about is how perfect he is? Strange..
Wants to go to Manchester!!!!!
Wouldnt it be funny if Harry was driving the Merc behind
In other news Jack Grealish bought a bag of Chips.
Harry was on the shine all weekend 😀 his in his pit sleeping 🤣🤣🤣
No one's gonna pay 160 million for a 28 year old
What other choice does he have? Levy doesn't let him go and if they really have a gentlemans agreement.. 100m£ is a fair price for a 28 year old also and levy didn't accept it. No other choice for Harry Kane.
Breaking! Kane is a striker who might play in Euro 2020
No way!  Harry Kane didn’t show up for training? ......OMFG!  Jesus Christ what are we to do?  Aaaaaaah 😫
Get a life sky sports
Sell him. Son can carry the team
I bet Kane snook inside in the boot ! I am a City fan but still feel this is totally unacceptable. He signed a fat contract and should at least honour it. He will regret this. It will piss off the Spurs fans.
Swap Martial for Kane,he fits like a glove.I bet Son is kicking himself now.😆
Interest from City but no bid.
Harry Kane was in his car behind the reporter 😁
How many years on his contract? Poor form? Has his flight got delayed
Kane don't do an odemwingie
He want to test water if is acidic or basic
A new saga started.
He's just stuck at underground coz of the flooding and signal failures.
He's in a helicopter hovering over Manchester waiting for the call.
Bad man Kane really wants to leave
That's because he's still inside Chiellini's back pocket. You guys can find him in Turin and bring him back.
Someone skipping PE has made national news lol.
Kane rrrreally wants to play against us 1st game of the season for real init🤷🏾‍♂️….pusillanimous lol-he should of just went in and TOLD Levy, n waited til AFTER that 1st game - going about it the way it’s being reported is Disrespectul😒🤬😤
Sadly for Arsenal fans Arteta, Holding, Xhaka, Willian, Kolasinac, Bellerin, Chambers and Nketiah all turned for training this morning.
He’s probably tired from all that euro stuff!?????🤔
I mean can you blame him, it's Spurs
It was same situation with Modric when he wanted to leave and had a gentleman's agreement.
Breaking!! Man doesn’t show up to work.
If di man waan leave why the heck Tottenham don't just mek di man leave..... smh
He's pulled a sick note 📝
1:55 You ain't gonna believe it, just spotted him jogging in. Missus was dropping him off but Sat Nav kept taking her down dead end streets with flower pots. They're all over London
Sensational
Harry Kane. Harry Saw. Harry Left.
Looking forward to his move to Manchester -  United :-)
Called Levy’s bluff. Fair play to him
LESSSSSSSGOOOOOOO COME ON
Imagine being caught out like this at work, people waiting there and when your late it hits the news.... 😂
city fans : 🙂
Breaking story that was Harry Kane In the a class
How don’t you know he was in the back of someone’s car 😂
Embarrassing ‘journalism’….
Might of missed his bus
Literally just 2 minutes of waffle coming out of these man's mouth 🤭😂🙄
But he told them 🤷🏿‍♂️
Werner is a bad influence on Harry
He is probably playing with his lego and train set what is the big deal
If he refuses to play he won’t get paid ha ha ha and won’t be selected for England which is even better for us fans
Sky sports stop making assumptions and trying to stir the pot , get your facts right before you try make yourself a story out of nothing . His just came back from holiday and had to take a covid test
Didn't show up at the Euro's either. Not Breaking News 🙄😂
No surprise considering he's not played in the friendlys ,looks like he's gone for sure city I reckon?
Levy is such a turd
And so it begins...  The endless summer saga of whether he will / won't he go to City
BUNGLINGHAM BOTCHSPUR!! We’re a joke of a club !
He just drove in
I am wondering what excuses Ole will have this season if they dont deliver a trophy.
I never expected this attitude especialy from kane,  its really arrogant & rude from him. He's has no right to do this, if he's got 3 more years on his contract its the club who has the right to decide not him after all he's not a messi or ronaldo.
a hundred million quid? Think I'd wish him well and adios if I were Spurs. He is one cruciate ligament tear away from being worth nada.
Fake News
i hear he is talking with Arsenal.
Breach of contract hope levy  fucks him up. So unprofessional. A disgrace
Don’t blame him, Tottenham blows
Well, Messi refused to show up for training at Barcelona not long ago...and we know how that turned out. So don’t give up hope, Spurs fans😉
This is bale at bottle top hotspurs all over again haha 😂
Can’t blame him he’s 28 and he knows he’s never going to win a trophy there! 😂
All this fuss could be for nothing, he might have stayed up because he's sick or it could be anything.
Nah must be a legit reason for this... kane don't go please stay
The 3 week rule only ended yesterday for him, Sky are just milking a story out of nothing.
I’m a Spurs fan and I would hate to see Kane go but I would take 100m plus Laporte. With Romero arriving and Laporte that would be an awesome CB pairing and we could spend the 100m on getting a replacement for Kane. Maybe Dybala
Imagine if he went to etihad.
My heart bleeds.... LOL
Hopefully this means Man City spend the 100mil on Kane and dont have enough money for Grealish so that United can get him next summer instead😁
He signed a contract so he should do as the club says.
Well he turned up the city training this morning😂
Wish me not turning up to work was described as sensational 😂
free harry kane from hostage
And Jack Grealish turned up at Aston Villa.
Sensational, whats sensational about it, who cares anyway.
Why and how is this breaking news?😂
This is going to get tasty!!
This is some Courtois level stuff
Hi sky, I was late for work this morning, I decided to have another coffee - I'll do you a voiceover for 5 grand
Harry kane to mancity!!!! Lets goooo
Oh no Paul. Lads I think Levy got to him.
Nice g
Writing is on the wall now
100+ sterling = Kane City: Just take Sterling! He is a good diver and king of miss sitter
Breaking: Harry Kane spotted at London Colney. As a gooner I would take a year in the championship for that headline :)
Imagine the reporting if it was Pogba who didn’t turn up to training.
The disrespect from Kane when Spurs have got their Europa conference league play off round draw to look forward to.
Maybe he’s just finishing his game of fortnite and will be ten mins late
Imagine if Kane walks up behind him and say's boo.
come on levy and spurs.sell this player....this player is overated..cant imagine he not fit can play for ucl final..then in final euro he so lazy..
Sensational news really
Oh dear
He thought he was due back in tomorrow, that’s all.
He has been granted an extra rest day or two due to England's exploits in the Euros.  This is not groundbreaking news and I wouldn't read too much into it.
1:56 Harry Kane shows up, decides to trip the connection
1:55 HARRY KANE JUST STOLE THEIR CAMERA'S BATTERY!
Harry spotted in Manchester!      False alarm was the wrong Harry
Probably at home having a cuppa with some snacks and binge watching some Netflix. The new season of Van Helsing is out.
I can confirm (despite being a United fan) that if Man City land Kane and Grealish in the same transfer window it will be the greatest trasnfer window arguably in history....
a bit like how he never showed up in the Italian's box in the final then.
lol Daniel Levy pulling the plug there...
u tabled 100m for Grealish..and u  asking D.Levy to accept 100mn for H.Kane... jokers
So like all the major games he’s played in yet again he’s failed to turn up again
The connection wasn't that "Sensational"
We’ve all had a few beers on a Sunday and not turned up to work on a Monday morning 😅
My Daniel Levy holds ALL the cards here. Thankfully, we are not a selling club now and if DL decides to let him go then only mega cash will see it happen. If we spend that cash on 3 or 4 very good players to fill in the badly exposed gaps we now have, then Kane going might not be too much of a bad thing
Kane flew to Abu Dhabi to convince them to sign him for city 😂😂😂
The only thing this report broke was my faith in Sky Sports News..
Wouldn’t he just be relaxing after a long season?
Harry kane actually showed up to Manchester city's training ground instead......after all that's were he wants to be
Aren't the euro boys still off? They are at Liverpool
"Gentleman's agreement" 😂🤣😂🤣 oh spursy spurs.
Had he been black....
Kane just switched off the camera
Paul did a dad at the end
He got so bad the director just cut him off in the end, after he said "sensational" for the third time
if he wants to win anything he needs to go, now. It is now or never for him.
Looks like Paul when missing at the training ground as well...
Sky grasping at straws again
Free Kane
He might have a problem or a family problem. Who knows
Grab ur popcorn people :)
Be funny if they were like “Harry Kane hasn’t shown up for training………  He was just very late this morning”  😂😂😂
Stop making harry kane a big thing cause after watching him in the euro wen he gave up on the team in the final i so dat he is not world class and he didnt win any major trophies yet.
I’m sure Harry Kane has done an Odemwingie. Better check the city hall cupboards.
A gentlemen's agreement with a businessman 🤣🤣🤣
It would be hilarious if when the camera cut out Harry Kane just arrived so they cut the cam🤣
He has been a great servant and respect the club. Just let him go, Levy
Just let him leave he’s done everything for this club he deserves to go and in trophies
Thats it guys..done deal🙂
Kane said from last season I WANT TO LEAVE, if they try keep him he will  just rebel, it's not a shock tbh
Harry Kane: ill 🤒  Sky Sports: TRANSFER! TRANSFER! HE’S LEAVING! HE’S LEAVING!
5 minutes later* BREAKING: Nevermind. turns out he was just a bit late.
He's probably sat at home enjoying a CUP of tea 🍵, More cups at home than Spurs 😂
Will he do the same to city if Real Madrid or Barca come in for him .
I want Kane at man City this season💙
It's better if you just ask the coach himself on why Harry Kane hasn't shown up.
Tell him he's always welcome at the bridge
He probably slept in. I do it all the time
Quite possibly the most sensational breaking news segment of my entire life. I don't know how to calm down - it's unbelievable, it's incredible, it's astonishing. SENSATIONAL
Even mason mount chillwel and james are still  away 😄
Ahh doing this is going to aggravate Pep. As evident in the past, Pep is not a fan of individuals who don’t behave in a professional manner.
Its fine his mum called in and said he had a headache 🤒
This just shows more players need to start putting release clauses in when they sign a contact, same as Declan rice.
Levy has nuts  promised Kane they will win the European conference within the next 3 years if he stays, that the level of ambition at spurs.
BREAKING NEWS: I guy I work with also didn't turn up for work this morning........... hope you're ok big man
He's gone back to Millwall on loan again
A source has said he was all dressed in his kit, about to go out the door but no one was there to do his shoe laces so he couldn't go
You sure he’s not just had a heavy weekend? And is hungover at home? Pulled a sickie ?
You know this is a very long video for a guy saying harry did not showing up until now.
If he goes to Manchester City how will the financial fair play work? 200 million plus on two players.
Kane throwing is toys out of the pram
Either Nuno is keeping him sweet with extra rest or he turned up the wrong training ground.
Signing for Hereford
what if he has a cold and skip 1 day of pre season training?
Did they try to phone him? 😂
Don't worry, he's got a note from his mum. She says he has contractinitis.
Let him just finish trimming the hedge in the background...
let him go
Tottenham fans will be sour if Chelsea trigger his clause💥
Detention.
He was on the Sesh
Sky Sports you should have kept you mouth shut last month.
Harry Kane will never raise a trophy, that's why I want him to go to Man City, so that other teams can win the league.
A gentleman’s agreement 😂
The problem with a 'gentleman's agreement with Levy is that he isn't a 'gent'. It's literally now or never for Harry. If he waits again till next year Man City will lose interest because Haaland will become available and then there will be nowhere left for him to go.
Paul’s current job is being on Harry Kane watch and just sitting at the Spurs training ground. Wtf is going on in the world, he’s getting paid to see if someone turns up to work
100mil to rebuild that team and win a title 😂😂
Unless he missed the bus,its pretty obvious where he is! 😂⚽️
When he move to Chelsea or City he will some trophies, not Audi cup
stoke city will have him
Kane is going to VIlla.
Kane is so overrated, literally never shows up in big games. Spurs should bite the hand off anyone that bids £120 mill+.
It's actually idiotic from Levy  What does he expect from a player who doesn't want to stay  This doesn't send a good message for the club if the talisman is not turning up  This will create a stir in the dressing room if hasn't already
100 million for a 28 year old. Wtf sell him quick and tap up homes under the hammer for dion
imagine if hes in that car that went past
Gareth bale to Real Madrid all over again
Imagine if Pogba did this. Would be called a disgrace and arrogant etc. English factor once again defending Kane. Great leadership qualities there.....
😂😂😂😂
Lol if pogba did this ………………. Never mind
New stadium, mourinho, Kane new contract, bale loan, nobody can say that Levy isn’t trying/ putting his money where his mouth is, it just takes time, we fluke getting to a ucl final and all of a sudden Kane thinks his god tier, yet he never showed up, nor did he for England in the World Cup or euros
He's not the only player whom hasn't shown up for pre season training. player like Bukayo Saka hasn't show up yet because they're still in holiday. 80% Kane gonna leave spurs in this current summer transfer window.
Obviously been advised by his agent and Man City representatives to do this, classy stuff
We need to stop thinking of players as being "owned" by clubs. They are human beings with free will, committed to their clubs by contract, but in their right to seek better working conditions if they feel their careers are stuck. In less than 5 years Kane won't be in his prime anymore. Tottenham failed to become the club Levy promised. Time to move on.
Good for you mate, you were promised last season by levy its time to leave now.
Paul is just receiving oxygen
Harry kane has decided at a later stage in his career he wants to win trophies
Day off
Sensational news 😂😂😂
Holy over rated to this selfish dhead who claimed other's goal. His work rate for the team is pathetic. He ain't the Great Alan Shearer! Even Petr Crouch chased harder for the ball than this dhead. What I say is that, with that Kane's style of waiting for the ball, even I can score goals la!
Why would he turn up . He doesn't want to be there
Tottenham is a poor mans Sevilla.
Anyone wanna talk about how the US has almost double the amount of medals in the 2021 Olympics than Great Britain?
Kane: *running late for training*
imagine if he just has a cold
Can’t blame this guy at all, given his all, never won a trophy in his career. Levy has to do the right thing now....
Gentlemans agreement means , "F" ALL  !
He’s acting very childish tbh
As a Spurs fan, he is a Disgrace, you don’t sign a New contract have a bad season, then throw a Strop, Son just signed new contract a Real Spurs Legend, sell that big nose muppet to City
Overrated.
Wow you guys get paid for this? Do your research Harry Kane not due for training until tomorrow as he’s having to wait for a negative covid test 🤦🏼
He had big game last night, and went missing, last seen before start.
Maybe his Uber was late
Big breaking news , sensational news. Truth is cameraman is Harry kane
Well, at least he can go on a path to winning more than an Audi Cup, spurs is a nice club but only a third tier one IMO Everton levels, you could argue Aston Villa are as big as Spurs, Harry Kane should’ve left them after the CL final.
Harry kane: 'sorry I'm late, I just picked up a 99p cheese burger from Mcdonalds"
daniel levy to nuno - just tell the press that kane is staying no matter what
the poor lad, he just wants to win something
this is great news, lets go
Spurs should let him leave
love to see him drive in to the ground while they’re talking 😂
Well considering how easy he falls down it might take him days to get there.
It's still early days man. Maybe he's just running late...
Reporter knew too much, kane had to take him out
1:54 - the moment Harry Kane turned up at the training ground, speeding and swerving all over the road in an angry rage at having to play for Spurs, accidentally mowing down poor Paul from Sky Sports!
Harry Odemwingie
Nobody cares... its only the English Media that want Kane win something. 28 year old with bad angles is not worth £160m.
Advice to young footballers, never agree to a "gentleman's agreement". Think about football owners, chairmen, agents. Would you have a gentlemen's agreement with people who are not gentlemen? Get it in writing.
Is he going pop up and say got yaaa 🤣🤣🤣 sky sports news is crazy lol
He's the reason we've lost both finals we've been in but he wants to win trophies. Take the money levy our front 4 have looked sensational pre season just need hobjberg to pass forward
Pay club 3years of contract kaneeeè
Is that Kane behind you? Watering the plant?
What about other euro squad shaw, magure, sancho😊? Not yet reached man utd
He's taking a English crash course
if you were a spurs fan saying “we don’t deserve Harry Kane” throughout the season how are you gonna start calling him a snake etc
It would be hilarious, if the car that drove in was Harry Kane's.
He’s on holiday in the Caribbean, extra time off after the Euros!
If kane is not in man city colours by Saturday his not coming
Imagine if Kane drives past the field reporter just as he finished his live cross 😂😂😂
Welcome to City
The only reason I supported Tottenham was cuz of mourinho. Now I support Arsenal and Manchester United
Why do players sign long term contracts at clubs like Spurs? Kane made his bed...he should lie in it. I honestly don’t want City to get Kane, another season of false 9 will do until we get a younger striker like Halaand.
Aurier wants out and he's been at training every day and look at this tosser sell him now levy
All egland plyers are not back the teams why do u take only hryy
Breaking news: Harry Kane is sleeping with Levy’s wife one last time
Why would you want to spend £100m on Kane when you could get Halaand for similar price next year?
leave the kane saga .... what happened to the cameraman in the end 😂😂 .... im sure it was Levy who stopped the cam recorder 😂😂😂
Yup there he is, in benz
World Breaking News oh jeez
He’s claimed he showed up and scored 4 goals
Imagine if he just arrives in the background while he is talking
What if he was just ill today?
Typical sensationalist nonsense. I bet he's on extended leave.
Has his learning support teacher been told what date he’s bck?
He doesn't need to train, anyway. Don't see the problem.
“Suggestions” and “we are hearing”, but no quotes or factual information of any note. Journalism really is trash
"We don't know, we don't  have any knowledge about it" - Sky Sports
Football manager 2020 and 2021 predicted that Harry Kane was unhappy and wants to leave for continental football. Boy was this game right🤣🤣🤣😂
He is world class He was like Beckam  Needs a better team  As a Arsenal fan I hope He wins a trophy
Chelsea should go for Kane if he's going to force a move
I don't blame him, we have to rebel in this society to get what we want anyway yk.👻😂.  Tottenham needs to let him leave, no sense in keeping an unhappy player  in your squad for the season☠️
Hes sitting in Etihad carpark waiting for his man city teammates turning up for training 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where's he going then guys? City? Utd? Chelsea? Real? Tiverton Town?
He might have COVID
Heard he has a TOEFL test.
That’s how you deal with Levy, well done Harry
He's playing golf with some English players.
He's probably just running late from his English lesson.
He’s probably at the dentist or something you desperate twats! Sky is OVER…always been a rip off…I can’t wait until DAZN steal the football from under your noses too!
Bit unprofessional - Kane is on a contract still - if any other person decide not to show up to work they not get paid - think need stay professional and see if move to City and be arranged .If not he still a spur player so what going do sit on bench until January 2022
There's no way he's going to put up with four years stuck in mid-table and the precedent for players forcing their way out of clubs has long been set.
Well he has forgotten that someone actually has to put a bid in for him first.🤦‍♂️
I thought the club/Nuno have a rule about being rested for 3 weeks after international tournaments, hopefully this is just that, can't imagine Kane spitting his dummy out like this
Spurs must sell harry kane and start to look for new options so many better young players who are willing to break a leg to play at epl..  With a new coach and new players coming in spurs can start to shift on a new era of football playing style..spurs in not investing well, this current team has Pottechino and mourinho setup they just need a new, fresh start.
"ITS TIME TO GOOOOOOOO!"
I still don’t understand how Cristian Romero wants to join this side. He’s still technically a Juve player so could definitely go back if he chose to or simply hold out for a move to a bigger side like Jules Kounde did.
He showed up to Wembley stadium forgetting that Spurs have a new stadium
Spurs is shite
All those people saying he wouldn't do it 😂. This man deserves to end his career a winner.
He’s been at my house on a weekender bender, he’ll be in tomorrow 👍🏻
He probably has permission from the club
It's because levy is a knob head
He's getting some English lessons.
Is this even news ? We kno he wants to leave ffs this isn’t “sensational news”😅
I have ZERO sympathy for hin why sign such a lengthy contract ??? Same as grealish his lucky villa actually has a decent morality and would sell for acceptable funds.... harry kane new levi is a con man harry kane new his price would rocket to a place that's crazy harry new he had high injury rate harry knows his not the youngest SO WHY SIGN SUCH A LONG DEAL .... NO SYMPATHY
Same thing happened to messi it's nothing
Absolutely sensational news! Really shocking ground breaking journalism
Kane knows if he stays he'll retire without winning a single thing in his career
What happened to the guy? Pretty sure it was Levy pulling out the plugs at the end when he got disconnected. What else did he do to him???
I cannot understand this Harry. Do you not realize the SPIRIT and SUCCESS and HONOR of THE PEOPLE'S CLUB??? 😡😡 GET OUT OF OUR HISTORIC CLUB. NOW. MOURINHO FANBOY. We never won anything with you. Most OVERRATED player I have ever seen put on the white jersey. GET OUT NOW 😡😡😡 I have never been cheering you on personally. Could see you were a POISONOUS ELEMENT. I can only imagine the tears of Heung-Min Son rn and it's burning me inside. NOT WANTED AT SPURS. GET LEVY OUT TOO I AM DONE WITH THIS CLUB. 😡😡😡 ARGHHHHH ARGHHHHHH ARGHHHHHHHHH
But he took the extra money when he was given a new mega contract, and if he was anything like the player he was a few seasons ago there would be a queue of big clubs after him... but there isn't.
Mcfc
"Senstational news" turns out he turned up at 8:00 before they were there or is unwell probably
BREAKING NEWS: I had oat milk with my coffee this morning
Levy's just waiting for a bid from the team he supports - but I don't think Arsenal can afford Harry.
0:45 there he is
Levi kidnapped harry
Levy surely doesn't want to miss a big chance to sell Kane for 100 M, because Kane will be 29 years old next year. Look at what happened to Hazard, Bale and Aubameyang after they reach 30
This is captain of a football club I don't care what he's been told, offered etc be responsible and act like a captain, he was never captain material, kinda like a spoilt brat imo
Arsenal fan, good on him. I wish kane the best winning trophies, he deserves it. Spurs on the other hand can go and get relegated 👍
He won't be in today as he has the "2 Bob Bits" as my mum used to say to my teachers.
1 missed training session is not sensational news 🤣
Get over it, he aint leaving even though he wants to. The only club who can afford him is City and there is absolutely no way they're paying Levy's price of £160m. He's most likely to leave next season, I dont know why everyone thinks these big clubs are just gonna do him the favour...
0:46  Harry arrived 🤣
Breaking news man doesn’t show up to work. Who cares 🤷🏻‍♂️
English media tried, but guardiola and man city sheikh do not spoil their money on Drama (Its coming home)🤣🤣
Just like how he didn't show up in the champions league final when we needed him the most?
Hey Paul Gilmore
FREE HARRY KANE.
Probably going to Chelsea 😂
Shambles when a club keeps players who publicly don't wanna be there
If he is going, let him go for a huge sum
All players should know by now that a gentleman agreement means nothing if it's not in black and white. We have seen it all over the world, it even happened to Mesi.
Levy stopped Video 😂
Spurs have given him a couple finals and done nothing in either🧐🤨🤔
If Kane is boycotting the ground, that would be extremely idiotic. I expect Levy to hold out for 160m. If City can quickly pay 100m for Grealish then this is no brainer.
Sell him man. I can understand both perspective on this but this won’t be good for the performances of the club. Take the 100 million now from city rather than risking a future transfer fee at a lower price. With that money, they can find a replacement.
Chelsea to intercept out of nowhere
'Big breaking news, sensational development' can't stop myself laughing
if he's anything like me he's just overslept 😆 Good on him though, no more Mr Nice Guy , love to see it ! Hope he gets his move for the good of English football !
Thats the negative to pay these players so much money, they can chose to be home from work whenever they feel for it.
Lets face it ; if this was a foreign player all the fans and media would be jumping on them saying they are disrespecting the club, fans, history and are a disgrace etc ( think Paul Pogba). But as always the pundits will not go in on an English player the same way; even though it is far worse for Harry Kane to do this as he is meant to be Mr Spurs and a lifelong fan etc whereas someone who is from another country has no natural affinity with the club. Same with diving ; Kane, Sterling, Grealish do it and its clever play ; they " won the free kick" ; foreign player does it they are cheating. Now lets call this what it is ; racism ; as the press and pundits are literally treating people differently for the same thing because of the country they were born into. Disgrace!
Oh my goodness sky sports will feed us this story till we throw up...
Big deal!! None of the Chelsea English players have reported back yet.. Omg Mount and Co are leaving, we're doomed!! -_-'
Harry Kane watch   Really sensational development 😂😂😂
Is the information that kane told Tottenham he want to leave sure??
But then why sign a new Long term contract. This is trying to have your cake and eating it. I would like to sign him but I hate this. He should just have run down the contract. He wanted more money but while hoping to leave.
I hope he leaves tbh. Spurs need a fresh rebuild. Harry needs trophies. Just get it done
Funny how people want him to win trophies but dont want him to go to City
It's not that Kane WANTS to leave, rather he HAS to leave. He has reached the ceiling with spurs and don't blame him for forcing a move away
He probably heard about the conference league and ran away
Love the way Sky sports state its sensational news, what if hes got shits and called in sick
Levy saying he could leave last year then going back on it, no wonder he's not into it
I don't know what to call it, the contract ,a transfer disaster or a Daniel levy masterclass. If it was not for the long contract Harry definitely would've left.
Paul did a Harry Kane at the end there
Who are Man City gonna sell if they sign Kane and Grealish both for 100mil a pop?? Does FFP even matter??
If Levy has gone against a gentlemans agreement, then Kane has every moral right to do what he is doing
Hes gone shopping with the misses
£150 mil or no deal
Just take 120 mil ..
Spurs won't win anythink in the nxt 5yrs aplayer of that clqss deserves to be in a team that has chances to win silverware
*3 years left on his contract* 😂😂
Good on him standing up to Levy 👍  Career wise it's now or never for him to make the jump and win something. Life is too short to be standing still.
Sat nav was set to Manchester and forgot 😂
English press is salivating
Oh Harry's on his way to the mighty blues....CTID 💙.
Daniel levy acting very adamant though instead of just accept that huge sum of money…Kane deserves trophies in his cabinet because he’s a top player 🙌
Not being funny - but the lad will be knackered from playing a major tournament with a clear injury all summer... not really surprised that he isn't there for the first day of training... the fact he hasn't been given additional leave is crazy
Honestly i feel like it would be better to sell kane, sell him early reinvest the money to rebuild a frankly awful Spurs squad with other than son no one can get into the Leicester 11. What will happen though is that kane goes this summer way to late and Spurs panic buy awfully and get up charged or leaves next season with no desire Spurs do awful again and you get less money for him next season.
If tottenham hold him hostage, then this club is a disgrace, along with its fans. Legit there are some fans that want to keep him against his will, saying, well he could have won trophies if he had won us the CL final, the carabao cup final, etc. It is because of him you sorry lot have even progressed this much...legit clowns.
Let him rot in the reserves if he plays up
Omg!
*Inside Levy's office* Kane: "I'm too good to stay at this level! Let me go to City!" Levy: "Who needs City when you can play in the Conference League!" Kane:
His bus was late lol
uh oh
City have played this well
All these theatrics only to start against City on opening day😂
Why ain’t I surprised?
That’s a shame. Kane will spend a whole season on the bench
If they gave Mourinho all the signings he wanted Skrniar, maybe Bernardo Silva +plus Christian Romero this year, they have won something!!
Would be funny if he just slept in 😄
Imagine if he’s just stuck in traffic
these contracts need to b revaluated,if a player signs for so many years,he made a sober decision,he must stick to it,how can u not turn up for work when u getting a salary from a club,these players r divas n not men of their word
Have any offers actually come in for Kane? If not he's skipping training why!? So Spurs can magic up some offers for him lol.  These things turn into a joke.  He's got a contract has he not!
"Sensational"??? Come on Sky!! Smh
This will be an interesting summer 😋
With city opted to bring Jack and Utd will probably prefer Haaland next summer..I think he himself regretting to pushing a transfer
The car that has just come in is carrying  harry kane ....Go confirm
He’s looking for trophies
Can anyone show me where harry says he wonts to leave cos i cant find it anywhere???
He's been partying with Wazza
Lol 0:55 "quite Messi" 😂😂😂
Levy being a jew should learn from Moses.. Let his Harry go.
He signed a contract... tough
so much for kane IS NOT THAT GUY hahah TOOLS DOWN🔧🛠
Did Levy pull the plug :-)
harry should act more mature!
I wonder who else didnt show up?
But he got to the euros finals,  so he could probably still be on holidays. Other clubs still have some of their key players absent. So this is not a breaking news
he had a flat tyre on the way,his on route lol
Sell him. He is overrated because he is english . Time to focus on son!
Very bad news for man utd😁😁😁
He must be on trial at Celtic!
Kane be crying in his house
Your ass is staying a Spurs boy 👦
Levy will make this messy, likely to sue him
The hype around the Donkey is ridiculous….. BREAKING NEWS ….,,, haha
Kane come to chelsea
Levy has to understand that he can't force him to stay, just let him go
Kane is a world class player he deserves trophies and i know mancity is the time for him if he wants trophies
Doesn’t matter they ain’t winning trophies anyway
If he keeps doing things to annoy levy then he won't leave
Fine him sick of seeing these "role models" refuse to turn up for their club because they want to move! Other ways of going around it. Yes he wants to leave and deserves to but this isn't the way to do it.
Just like how he doesn’t turn up in big trophy-winning games. Enjoy being handheld to trophies by Pep.
Stop his wages
Who would’ve thought that Kane of all people would rebel like this but imo it’s the only way that could possibly convince Levy to sell him. Kane knows it’s now or never!
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣He's right that club is in shambles
Please please please please please don't goooo😭😭😭
Here we go English media will talk about this FOREVER, it's really not thaaaaattt deep tbh.. 🙄🤣🤦🏾
Lol 😂
He's gone to wembley stadium with his England kit on that's all!
Does kane understand that he's going nowhere
Please KANE sign for UNITED
lol feels bad Tottenham fans
London is red 🟥🟥🔴🔴🔴❌❌🔺️🔺️🔺️
skip as many trainings you want, levy aint letting you go.
I don't blame him tbf he deserves more than spurs
First viewer
Ce to city lad come on city
He has to leave
Please stay Kane
Don’t think he understands that city can’t acc afford him. Spurs aren’t gonna reduce his price
He isn't going to city end of
Kane gone missing in big games again!
Loooool
