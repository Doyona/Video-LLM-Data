Banks !!!!
30/30 with the zoom ….hit the man on the man on the moon ‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Been listening to Banks since early 2000's. The guy is like a fine wine. One of, if not the most underrated and underappreciated rappers of all time.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Fireeee
“Only time I miss a step is when I skip one” geez
Lazy Lloyd  Banks!!!! 💯
Just another banks workout
Lloyd banks is g-unit records south side Jamaica Queens nyc 🔥 🔥
He’s reading the lyrics. That’s not a freestyle. That’s a song. I miss 2004 Lloyd Banks. This generation sucks
Ecclesiastes 9:10     “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.”  King James Version (KJV)
Head so good it good it got a halo 💀💀💀💀 banks is a legend

"Stay out the way cos hallow tips don't got a age limit, you can be NBA size or Rae sremmurd, send me a care package with my accolades in it" nasty
Head so good it got a halo

He was too talented to be in G-Unit
Dis cat so smooth you can't even get hype all you can do is listen and break yo neck nigga. All his flows be smooth don't know why they be hating on this brotha plus he stay in his lane never hear him respond to the negative energy even tho they hate on his name.

They blackballed the flow.
1:17-1:19🔥
He needs to drop a new album 😤
"Stay out the way, Hollow tips don't have an age limit, You could be NBA Size or Rae Sremmurd" 😂😂😂😂
Banks is effortless..
Banks still top 10 freestyler. 50 made the best point. its a shame he lazy
Its 2024-03...and this freestyle is yet to be BESTED ❗❗👑🔥
Was sick when Kobe died but laughed when Oprah fell!! Whew!!!!
firew
Somebody just recently said Cam'ron most recent Flex flow is better than Banks. Lol
Just had to hear this again….. Banks is one of the very few that been up to this platform on Flex freestyles and hasn’t spit a bar or a verse that he’s used from his album or up-and-coming album,  he always has some new material!
G welcome
Drake, sign him
No one better.
Top 3
Hot 97 Blazin' hip hop and R&B You're now tuned into G-G-G, G-Unit Radio

BANKS IS STR8 ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Banks def still has the bars but you can also see what 50 said was true. Dude is 𝙩𝙤𝙤 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙚 being the local cat with the name recognition. Banks could have been a lot bigger but his personality is like a man on his own island where he aint ready to battle or launch nothing major.
Dope I just no energy
We needed THE REAL format shout out TO THE PLK 🫡💯 THE SOUL SELLERS RUINING THE ART.
I'm a prog metal head. dont listen to rap. but  --- "gold-diggers in plain clothes, looking for the end of rainbows..."

PLK 🔥💯
When I used to write bars, he was my influence. Of course I never touched him but studying his styles elevated me massively
Sheesh he said I lay it on her she going to come like sneeze s woooooooo😅😅
Alright FLEX, we can all agree you gotta bring Homie back
Best rapper in g unit
What's this beat?
For the haters whatever is worth I wish em welll
“ I was always the sickest man in the room   30/30 with zoom  Could hit the man in the 🌙 “
Who’s better?
I saw Banks at Universal Orlando 2 years ago walking around with his family being a family man and was cool to see and I gave a fist bump and kept it moving .. Had my family and we were just both being dads and husbands . was dope
"Send me a Care package wit my accolades in it, colored money getchu black rocks white beaches, i lay it on her she gone come twice like sneezes"🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I apologise, I have never truly listened to LB, my mind just said "oh he is some corny 50 cent hanger on"  I listened to this and im now currently fully checking his whole back catalog, he is sick man sheeet!!
Same 90s flow
Banks lost it
Banks is easily top 5 of all time, he’s better than jay
Eminem literally said his favorite rapper is Banks
One of the real ones out here ❤‍🔥
His lil bro fire to😮
Pusha T vs Banks. Make it happen🔥🔥🔥 #PLK
Who here knows this isn’t Lloyd banks real voice it’s also the reason he lost he’s fans
This dude has carried me though many years. I dont know what it is about Banks- but he just delivers something that permeates my sou. When i start up my car- I always think..what Banks track ? Thats my mark of a dope MC
banks is my fave rapper ever
What is this beat called Lloyd banks on i wanna hear it
My nigga. Banks is the most underrated.
Color me bad
This nigga  is DIFFRENT on the Riddim
My favorite rapper without question he said Im always the sickest one in the room 30 30 with the zoom will hit the man on the moon boom 🔥👌🏽 tbh i hope BANKS does more funk flex freestyles with more classic hip hop beats 🐐
Lloyd Banks is on my top 10 rappers list of all time. Witty punchlines, metaphors, underrated albums, mixtape legend.
Amazing beat! Perfect match for Banks!
Banks the best ever
Plk
Love is voice
*"Stepping over old FRIENDS / IN 40 below TIMBS..."* 🔥
Killed it
my favorite rapper apart from the GOD NAS!!!! Up there in GOD RANGE!!!
every freestyle he does he's always looks like he's not about to rap and starts staring off into space then kills it😂😂😂😂 everytime
Hot 97 wouldn’t be much with us viewing/hearing it. It would just but two guys on the radio. Definitely why Lloyd said what he didn’t in the end about screening. Ruined it for me in my opinion
Classic 🫡🙏🏿🎁
banks nigga
Screen DollaMike he make the cut omm
Lloyd Banks is Michael Rainey Sr 😅
Banks has always been the best lyricist in g-unit
🔥🔥🔥 unfuckwithable
Top 10 freestyle I’ve heard easy

Want part 5, I’ll comment on every post get the message! Get the goat back to drop freestyle greatness! Greatness is just another word and the greatest is Christopher Charles Lloyd ya heard!
Laid back killer bars!! Legend!!
Lloyd’s spits better than 50 period. It’s like he chill with The Wu. He’s got smooth and catchy lyrics blended with some word play. Plus he keeps going. Reminds of those mix tape days. The Glory days of Real Hip Hop.
WHY isn't the beats always the same;Come-on  "Flex" change the rhythm for once🤦🏻‍♂️
PLK
Banks is a bar god in book on me of the best …… facts
He is very underated.50 never disliked him its just that at the time 50 was trying to graft him to greatness.he is great off his own if you ask me but from the business and marketing point of it,if he had followed 50's platform he would have had even more cake.
Damn. 20 years later and he’s still on fire 🔥 .
Stop playing with Banks , Goat status
That's the unit we tune into.
I was thinking at what point to break in and write a comment-   This guys word play is crazy.   All he’s freestyles are all classics…
Real east coast rap
Consistent
Damn excellent!! It be sounding like he gon mess up, but he never does!! He a cyborg!
Cyborg Banks

Before any rapper raps on flex studio.. Call Bank$ so he can screen them 😆
i wish banks, had game’s career . would of liked to see him as a bigger solo artist, more than game, after the unit ended …
Banks spits lines that make me twist my face up like I ate something sourrrrrr hahaha I’m going to make my GTA 6 online character look like him
Banks spits lines that make me twist my face up like I ate something sourrrrrr hahaha I’m going to make my GTA 6 online character look like him
Never seen a ghost in me studio to catch my drift
First time I heard him was on Pimp: " I let them do as they please as long as they get my cheese".. and I knew he was a great rapper
"Head so good it had a halo" 💥💥💥
'Head so good it's got a halo' 🔥🔥🔥
Take notes u holy skinny jean wearing millenials, thats how u do it!
"took prides in show and tell"
I dunno why but that NBA/Rae Sremmurd line is funny af! It was simple but funny af! Not surprised Flex and Juanyto were crackin up 😂😂😂😂
Beat you a mill game won't mention banks name banks would eat game up
No drill artist sound like this. This Real Rap!!!! Bars...
The way funk flex says “Lloyd Banks … Funk Flex 🥵” 3:18   Banks obliterated that ish . I knew for some reason when I clicked on this freestyle it was gonna be some heat
Banks gunna scorch every time !!!!

He ain't even trying n makes it look so easy that some might go over ya head.  Rap comes natural to that man.  Underrated.  Unpopular opinion but man is easily top 5 imo
Lloyd is the most underrated rapper/lyricist of all time
He so to himself it’s crazy even being introduced you can see it in his eyes like “Let me body this real quick then prolly eat and go home”
What’s this beat called?
This is MC'n
FREDO BANG VS BOOSIE: FAMILY TURNED OPPS https://youtu.be/1igCni0QQy4
I feel like 90% of the comments here are sponsored by Banks...wow, not to hate, but I don't since when he is considered "all time great", "top 5" etc.  someone tell me what he's looking at the whole time.
Real fans know banks killed this beat like 20 years ago
“Was sick when Kobe died Laughed when Oprah fell” bruh 😂
What beat was that?

He is reading those bars....
He doesn't even have his entourage with him

Been a while since I seen a real rapper on flex 😭
Who remembers when he and G-Unit freestyle on this beat on the  classic Automatic Gunfire mixtape
That was fire but a couple Em shots subliminal in the end for sure....break the bar's down 🙏🔥
Who knew clout chasing would have the streets shifting 😖😖😖😖😖
Somebody Comment 👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾 the best Lloyd band songs I can listen too always heard the name but never listen to his music
Set the tone
P.L.K...Damm this is the very best freestyle I've heard all year besides Conway .. Banks is top 1 idgaf who is better TELL ME.. WHOOO.. THANK U FOR GREETING MY EARS
The outcome is income him and Drake sharing bars!!!!!!
"Stay out the way cuz hollow tips dont got an age limit"
One of the best lyricists of all time tbh...his run after Return of the PLK was especially crazy. I highly suggest listening to his tapes and work from 2008-2012. Some of the hardest rap
Spitting that hot 🔥🔥🔥 and his name is not Dylan
Had to rewind that real quick.
Tyreek dad putting in work!
The game needs Bank$
Straight fire
COTI 2 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What’s the name off the beat
No disrespect to 50 or da rest of the G unit, but I always thought Banks was a monster on the mic. I think G-unit held him back, well 50. Just imo. But banks is a Goat.  Peace
This nigga didnt crack a smile! "Im on point mf i aint blink all day" Lloyd Banks

“Sharpening my weapon to protect my gift, never seen a ghost in my studio if you catch my drift”🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Ain’t no ghost writers in banks studio. That bar was crazy
Lloyd Banks still so effortless
Flow give me chills son!
*YES PLK AKA BLUE HEFNER!!!* This dude is incredible still killing. Another Flex sessions smoked. Funny thing is go listen to the gunit freestyle on this beat Bank$ murdered his verse.
Banks yo still riding to his freestyles
Von is alivee

The answer to The Game’s L.A Leakers Freestyle jab. Notice how he even picked a West Coast beat.
PLK 🔥🔥🗽🐐
That look 👀 that flex gave Big Banko 🔥🔥😎 It’s only right Top 5 in the building

“ i done flew around the 🌎  Split backs in Medellin,  Orange & Blue (🍊and 🔵)  Cap/ Mets 🧢)  The back say ‘SELL THE TEAM’   Still ONE of the most underrated U ever seen/  A Feen/  My 👃🏽 scream to the smell of Green”    You gotta be from Queens to catch that Mets bar 😂 #PLK 🔥 #QGTM #SSWO
I'm still waiting for your visit in Japan.
What’s the instrumental?
Absolutely terrible. Looks like he is reading this supposed freestyle of a screen. Rap voice and style awful.
This was better than his original imo 👏 🔥 siiiiiiick widit
Cant say how many time i HAD to rewind this. Banks has always been my top 5 lyricists!!
🔥🔥💯
Still a Beast! 💯
BANKS  DOPE 💉💦
he said passport full of features where your bars can't go 💪💪💪💪
Outta this world
Flloyd Banks🥊🎧
ty
#RAIDERNATION representing!!! Shouts out to OG BANKS for still murdering beats 💯
"I can't say I love you I don't know what that means I'ma PIMP " Lloyd banks
''Sharpening my weapon to protect my gift'' ~ Banks 🔥
What’s the name of the original song
Always loved this dude, But his energy was mad distant on this. Bars were there, but there was no fire like he used to spit with.
Lyrically the best in G unit
Banks got not only lyrics for days but has one of the grimiest rap voices on God. 💯
Love Banks but he needs to tweek that flow just a little bit to evolve with the new times
I loveeeeeeee when he freestyle it’s just so much 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YEAH BABY, THIS WHAT I’M TALKING BOUT/MISSING ❤️🙌🏾
This nigga banks is the truth real talk 🔥
Top 5  its a easy call been knew he was the s***.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He just reminded us why he is the "Punch Line King". Can't hate on this. 2 things made him unsuccessful: his voice, and because 50Cent was too huge that he casted a shadow over the rest of the Unit.
Go Crazy ‼️‼️💯💪🏾👑
banks really said nothing outside the bars 😂
Lyrically you have to put “Banks” in the top 10 easy and as far as smooth rappers I’d put him and Fab as today’s smoothest rappers
This is my Top Most Favorite  Artist 🗣🎙 ..he know how to walk🚶🏾‍♂️ on Any Beat with Ease 👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾
The fact that this only got 17k speaks more volume for how many haterz banks actually has, than his bars alone.🤦🏽💯💪🏽
You were supposed to have Yayo with him or immediately following. Like the old mixtapes did
TOP5DOA
Just listen to drillmatic from the game  This freestyle is better then all his song 😄
"As long as the outcome is income" 🔥
This is my 4th times listening to this and now that I can hear. And understand it’s sooo fire banks does his thing you just have to listen
Nigga said his studio too hot he don’t wear no goose in there
They must’ve forgot he was the nicest lyricist in Gunit
New Video: T.Dot - Green Light [filmed x Geaux Wavy]
I forgot how hard this beat was
Flow Effortlessly 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stop playing with that man!!! Like banks ain't been stamped 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
banks always been a real music man and lyricist
This that real rap right here 💯
Yessssssssssss🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾thank you banks we need a V9

Mudi Mabiriani Alikuwa Hapa 🇹🇿
I wonder, when FunkyFlex gonna re-invite Griselda 😳again to freestyle???🤔🙄😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦💯
His face at the end said it all…he’s fed up with the type of music that’s being fed to em
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of my favorites…BANK$💯💯
Been in my top 5 for a decade
Head so good it came with a halo
My stomach is touching what I'm clutchin, to give you more than a concussion,
ayo banks thank you
Lloyd banks & Jadakiss gotta happen
Banks straight but his flow is boring just my opinion
Banks deserves a funk flex compilation!!  "Head so good it came with a halo" 😇😂🔥
Banks destroyed that beat lmao 🤣
“You buggin” and tuggin on 2 straps they both Chanel” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ill put the plk against who tf ever, this nigga already smoked enough roses, this shidd easy to em. much love to the real music lovers, not that emotional bs
Cassidy nor game don't want it with Blu Hef
30/30 wt the zoom mte ht da man in da 🌙!
Banks just needs hot beats the flow on point.
Hunger for more still high on my list of the greatest albums ever I said it
Bank$ Ain't No Joke "Hard Body Bar Banger"
Never really thought Lloyd Banks was that good...still don't.
Banks always been a savage💪🏾
PLK ALL DAY
Just one of the best. A legend straight up! Still listening to his first album. He needs to get highlighted more.
Mediocre rap nothing special no energy dull voice . Never was the illest in the room
When tf he rap like that...sheesh my boi😎🥶
My guy body bag
He definitely  understood the assignment!!!
Boring. Old school imaginary bars 🤷🏾‍♂️
Day 1 banks fan. Never fell off. Never!
I never clicked on a video so fast. It’s so effortless for the PLK 🔥🎧👂🏾🤯🤯
You can be NBA size or Rae Sremmurd 🔥🔥🔥
00:00:24
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Banks 🔥🔥
I was just here 4 days ago.
Where’s this beat come from? So familiar can’t remember the name of the song
Damn!! What a comeback . One of the greatest MCs in the history. #PLK
Lloyd always been nice. Always has a trash beat. If he ever had any fire track he would be better known .
This is the perfect example of a beat carrying average bars....most 90s beats will save wack emcees.
Head so good it got a Halo
You can tell the respect Flex has for this legend, he always talks during peoples verses and this is the first I've seen where he bit his tongue.
Name of this beat please can one of my fellow hip hop heads help?
Had to come back to see if I was wrong because the 1st time ain't grab me...I think I was wrong. I smoked prior so its hittn 🤔😂😂😂
Lloyd MFing Bankssss!!!!
#PLK #LEGEND
#PLK #LEGEND
I feel like Banks can literally continue to rap like this & effortlessly kill it even though rap/hip hop continues to changes 🔥🔥🔥
We all know who was the real lyricist of G Unit
His low energy is just not doing justice to his bars though.
Legend
"....Head so good, it gotta Halo on it!"🔥🔥🔥
Plk plk plk plk plk. He is still dat nygga
Did he just say at the end, "I hit the man on the moon, goomm"!?!?🤦
Before the next rapper come up here capping let me screen them first took me out🔥🔥🔥🔥
SCREEN THESE NIGGAS FLEX THEY CANT RAP
Glad to Banks still here always was one of my Favs I still bang I'm so Fly and Karma and still one of the hottest double entendre/punchlines ever My name ring cross State/ And you ain't got all the way to L.A. to get your MC ate (MC 8ight)
Don't scheme at the rocks on hand before your mama see her seed in a bag like popcorn man.
Banks the fine whine of rap. He's been good since the beginning and only got better with time. And only the real mature have appreciated him then and knew what lloyd been capable of reaching.
MY DAWG 💯💪🏾
Man 50 just knew banks had it!!
Effortless. Just beautiful. 🫡
🔥🔥🔥🫡
🔥🔥🔥
Lloyd vs 50 in verses who's the winner 🏆
never seen a ghost in my studio
🔥🔥🔥
Flex, the only time I miss a step is when I skip one/ Grind now and celebrate when the flips done/ cool with it,  long as the outcomes income. 😎
Nasty no matter what it is🔥🔥🔥🔥 always dropping heat anit no one touching banko....
That was equivalent to a dunking on somebody crouch all in their face…not saying a word afterwards. Just mean mug ✊🏽
Color money get you black rock & white beaches 🔥🔥🔥😵‍💫
The GOAT
He needs to drink some water. I couldn't listen to this and I am a fan
🐐
Dj couldn’t choose a better beat? Banks killed
Jesus!!!! The Hip Hop scene is steaming right now 🔥🔥🔥
“Grind now, Celebrate when the flip Done”.
"Always been ahead of The Game" yeah true I always listened to you more than him and I can name more songs with you than with him.
Big L kinda flow😎
"stepping over old friends in 40 below Timbs " was a bang bang  shot !  "   If you caught the line ..break in down below with a reply
Ok banks!!
Best out of G-Unit to this date. Don't debate me.
😤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐👑
The silent assassin 😬🔥🔥🔥
Never understood why Flex shaded Griselda
No cap, he still better than 95% of current rappers
The hunger for  for more and Murphy’s law was my first two cds Ever bought shout out banks I still bang im so fly Karma ain’t no click and smile
Think that was for Game he was talking crazy on his freestyle

"head so good it came with a halo" PLK
In my humble opinion this is the only man to hold a candle to Black Thought on Flex. Let him screen em first.
https://youtu.be/0zMY2gFJqps
Don’t act like you didn’t drop that fire late in CT. That was stupid. Still looking for it.

Banks has always been my favorite out of g-unit. He make 50cent look like a kindergartner.
Banks told'em he had C-notes from different years on Banks' Victory.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
Banks was in his zone..he had 5 mins left in him
Dope 💥🤯🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
PLK never misses... man been consistent with the delivery and flawless execution for decades. G.G.G.G.G-Unit
Wow! Just WOW! Banks is that dude! So underrated! That was just FUEGO all day! 🔥🔥

Lloyd banks the best rapper world my niggaz 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Always been ahead of the game.  Ain't have to change with it.  Anywhere they pour cement out, I put my name in it.

Now every mornin's a fast start.. And ain't no problem gettin dressed cuz my closet got more aisles than path-mark. Run when we startin the raid.. Or leave wit twelve shells in ya mouth- like a carton of eggs..imma young pimp, pardon my age.. I aint got long hair- but if i did, she'd be partin' my braids..we just find out what club they at- take em wit us- and run a train on em like a subway map.  _Lloyd Banks Victory freestyle QGTM
He have them same headphones in ever flex freestyle
Starting out crazy
He threw a shot at game "always been ahead of the game aint have to change wit it"'🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best rapper alive!!!

The most Lyrically out of the Gunit group and definitely underrated
My favorite rapper no question... hear me out.. Lloyd Banks should do a rap battle 😤 that flow always been ridiculous... the dj should have picked a better beat something more throwback this beat lowkey trash but Banks murdered it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🫣

Rapping this good for banks is like steph curry shooting 3’s it’s jus effortless
“Customize it make a palm box fit ya team”🔥🔥banks on another level man
“Always been ahead of the game anit have to change wit it anywhere they pour out cement I put my name in it”🔥🔥
This made my day
"I was always ahead of the game" it is a lil diss to The Game maybe?
He doesn't age
Banks is still that  dude hands down😤😤
The most underrated rapper of all time. G.O.A.T
This Nigga made gunit dope we all looked forward to a banks verse
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Blue Hefner > Gayme
Easy Money Banks 😤😤😤
He already murdered this beat lmao “I hear this everyday banks don’t treat me like the next b I t c h”
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What if STATIONS went around to cities asking for freestyles from random people?   That'd be LIT Yahearme
Banks is just something else man. PLK baby!
And that’s how it’s done.
This needs more views.

BANKS ‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
banks finally getting his fuckin respect 💯🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Always said he was on another level lyrically in g unit. Banks has a flow you have to listen to a few timesto actually catch how fucking insane he really is. His calm demeanor his switches and short sentences that mean way more than he says is just hard to ever find nowadays
Banks grimey voice still sound the same that’s wassup tho
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Real Hip hop. #Banks 💯
He's had it when he mentioned Kobe already
😮‍💨🔥😮‍💨🔥
Soon I seen i immediately clicked! This dude is deadly on that mic 🎤 def top5 steady on repeat
The One and Only! Banks!
🔥🔥
🤯🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥
The energy was off it was a weak instrumental. Banks is a monster but he needs to go on a much hungrier platform and spit these bars I didn't feel the excitement
Funk Flex doesn't have that same energy you had once before. I didn't feel the excitement from him it was just another guest to get viees . Would artist like Banks you need better production for him to spit his golden bars on
"Scope wit da zoom hit the man on the moon 🌚"🔥🔥🔥🔥

Lloyd mf banks!!!!!
The Man Said and I quote " u can b NBA size or Rae sreamond / just send me my care package with my accolades in it"! So many in between the lines that makes you have to listen to get what he's actually saying. That's a lyricists. Been a Banks fan since a teen and being his age now means I actually grew up tk his music. All the mixtapes my personal favs were the Halloween Havoc . So yea Salute to Banks amd his continued Hunger for more Attitude.
always different with him

Look like two ol heads that’s tired 🤣🤣
Nah Banks flamed up crazy on this one different! PLK 🔥🔥🔥🔥
*Compared to other rappers who were cookin back in da days, all of them are either hella corn now or just not that same monster, so to see Banks still go off like that after so many years is incredible!* *No cap, this is right up there with anything he spit in his prime. And it's crazy how his flow aged flawlessly. Only Jadakiss and Fabolous can say the same.* *As far as punchline, straight bar for bar killers, they all fell off somehow. Eminem, Canibus, Styles P, Cassidy, etc. All them "bar for bar" freestyle niggaz lost atleast, at best, a step or 2.* *And for those who were really there, at that time, know how wild that era was n Banks was right there at the top, pause, and this is why. Legend in the flesh. Top 5. Uncrowned king. Period!*
Never knew banks was this nice, Voice control crazy!
I’m # 1 in the draft just ask u lookin at the rap lebron James! U had to be there to understand 💯💯💯
Banks still got bars damn!!
Banks??? Had to tune in
*And just like that* "snap" 🫰 Banks showed he's *STILL* the punchline/freestyle *KING* 👑 ‼️‼️❗❕❗❕ *Like if you agree!!!*
We love Banks. Thanks for being true to ur craft
*Banks just showed he's STILL the punchline King* 👑   Like if you agree
*Banks just showed that he's STILL the freestyle king* 👑    Like if you agree

New York's Most Slept On LEGEND
The amount of punchline and schemes this man  used
Lloyd Banks should rip The Game for coming out with that wackass diss track on EM.
"Head so good got a halo on it" 😇
He's clearly reading off something
Can't nobody come up there unless PLK SCREEN EM FIRST!!!
JAVAAAAAALE MCGEEEEE
For the haters for what ever it’s worth I wish’em well, felt sick when Coby died laughed when Opra fail. 🔥🔥🔥 from opening line
PLK! If he get back with 50 he will be dominant
🔥
Banks is one of the Best!!
When the beat dropped ...and LB started bobbing his head like he was in Eminems animated  "Mosh" video I slid my seat up...uh ohh...this finna be a banger!!
A Flexz bring Jadakiss up there no disrespect to Bankz 🔥🔥🔥
One of the most unique voices in hiphop
Way better than the crap game just dropped against em!!!
True MC ❤️

Soon as I saw Banks I pressed like 💯 Gggggggunit
Maddd🐐🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

"Passport full of features where your bars aint go"  OMG🔥🎯
🤔 people with chubby cheeks hardly age
So east for him crazy talent
Autolike
Sharks machines Utah kkk
Ait that was hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Through the era of oversized jerseys and 2 way pagers... Was the punchline king that provided us some of the hottest bars in Rap.  You really had to be there to know the impact.. I still throw on the banks workout freestyles. 🌹🌹🌹
Banks need to be talked about more when it comes to lyricism because this dude always been dangerous with his flow..Idc with nobody say he still the PLK in my book 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Qgtmfm
What’s up with the mic? Quality is poor 😢
PLK punch line king 👑
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hot 97 is irrelevant.
You know what time it is when banks touch mic!!!! Fuego !!!!!!
ALMOST EVERY BAR I WAS LIKE GET EM BANKS 🔥🔥🔥🔥 #QGTM
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Def one of my favorite emcees to drop post 2000! Top tier! Smooth yet lethal. Def a shot at Game there imo on clout chasing line.
Legend
He went at 50s neck with that bar 🤯🤯
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
BANKS IS HARD!!!!
YO' IS BANKS DOWN WITH THE LYRICAL RAP GOD "GRAFH" NOW. THAT SWEATSHIRT???

Hollow tips don’t got a age limit 🫡
One word. Cold.
My face is on sucking lemons listening to this Banks Banks banks g unit
greatness artist all time favorite rapper
🥶 AF
And this is what "HIP-HOP" not "RAP" is supposed to sound like. Actual talented microphone skills. This is the CULTURE. Yes, our music has evolved but the world has watered it down. He just bodied the rap game with just a freestyle. #PLK #LloydBanks #Coti2
What's the beat
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo     Natural Talent. Some people just got it
Banks!!! Head so good she got a halo 😇
One of my top 5 underated mc's
"As long as the outcome is income" that's a drake line
Banks has always been dope.. but that voice tho, I can't listen to that I'm sorry..
Danm I remember when the whole G-unit went to freestyle back in the day still epic
Yo he bodied the game, i caught all the subliminal lines sheesh 🔥
If you don’t see Banks as one of the best then you don’t know hip hop. Nobody had punchlines like him during the G-Unit mixtape era, he killed every verse he spoke. The Banks Workout is one of the greatest lyrical showcases ever
STEPPIN OVER OLD FRIENDS IN 40 BELOW TIMBS 😤
🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
Head so good is got a halo 😇 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Banks never missed🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't count steps if you ain't moving to stationary on the might miss a step with it
Epic better n better
#QGTM #SOUTHSIDE #BARS
Oscar the grouch
WHEN DID TRACEY MCGRADY START Rapping
HARD
Oh my goodness! That’s all folks!
What was he looking at
Straight bars it’s a few that’s super duper elite. Banks is one. Cass is one you can say whatever you want about him. Black Thought is one. Fab is one. It’s a few more but I don’t wanna think too long.
Banks fire need him back
Top 10 ever idgaf
"Head so good it got a halo" 😂😂😂
I had to run it back. “BARS”
Banks cool calm and collective
Good look who ever comes after banks.
New artists this is how you spit a freestyle with real bars no back pack raps.
Fire🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hunger for more banks wow 👌
GET'EM BANKS! 😤😤😤😤😤😤
His bars make you have chills.
Lloyd banks the best freestyle artists of all time.
Ngl, I came here to hear a response! Still wasn’t disappointed though!
He did this beat already
Yikes
That was effortless 🔥
“Stay out the way cuz hollow tips don’t got a age limit…You could be NBA sized or rae sremmurd ” 😅🔥🤯 #plk
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
Dude the most overrated underrated rapper ever. He always look bored on the mic
He should just take Em’s dirty work and burry Game. It’d be good for both Game and Banks to just have a lyrical battle.
🤷🏿‍♂️in my opinion BANKS always been a good writer however when he raps i never feel his conviction 🤷🏿‍♂️
🔥🔥🔥🔥 LLOYD BANKS 4EVA💪🎤🎶
Still one of the best with the pen and flow
Great bars , delivery is 🗑.
thank god!! thats all i gotta say
still a problem, listen
Flex know banks well all the times when he brings banks he bump his head like he is listening to 2pac songs 🤣🤞🤞🤞
Lloyd  Banks. .........Please keep grinding and Rapping...,UR one of the MC's......that keeps rap.... hip hop....what we call pure heart and soul
50 needs  to put his Ego to the side and  put the Band back together . Banks Been Raw
Q.G.T.M.   baisley southside

“QGTM”💪🏾💯🫡🗽💰💸💵
Flex, the only time I miss a step is when I skip it.....
PLK always spittin that 🔥
Can’t see this men on punch line it’s the  PLK LETS GO
Out of the whole G-unit camp Lloyd always had the most raw skill and talent. Mainstream or underground the guy still has a cult following. You can’t really say that about the rest of the group, maybe Game but that’s it.
The best out of g unit. Lloyd Mf'n banks
Lloyd always 🔥
who mad that Lloyd Banks is STILL ONE OF THE BEST…
banks the fucking goat
Gun shot fire
Banks over trap beats would be a cheat code.
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Banks had some anger at the end of that I know he hearing game running his mouth clout chasing you guys need to pay attention to each word cause that look in the 📷 he gave he has his target ready. Just wish they gave banks a better beat gutvi get why they giving him those beats cause not alot of rappers can rap over hard beats

Lloyd Banks has been MURDERING every album and being quite about it.
1:39 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
P.L.K still hunger for more*
Banks is the only rapper I have heard that makes me wonder “how the hell does he come up with this stuff?” I swear, and I be rapping here and there, I used to take it more seriously before, I used to be a few thousands of plays just rapping over other peoples beats, I was saving my original work for an original project but yo, when I tell you Banks uninspired me because I was like “I’m never gonna be that nice” he tore me down bro 😂 he in my top 5 for real
More bars than bike shop 🙏🙏🙏

Am i wrong for hitting the like button b4 he spit lol 🔥🔥🔥
He’s nice with the pen but he doesn’t have that “it” factor. That’s why he’s been stagnant he has fans but couldn’t maintain the steam he had when he first came out.
Is he reading this off a screen? Lol
GAS ⛽️ = 🔥

Game ain’t fuckin with this dude pen to intricate and too many flow pockets #tooelite
Looks like he reading off a screen.   His voice sounds terrible too!
Freestyles always dope!... drop some some music tho bro
Banks always show out for Flex. Never disappoints 🔥🔥🔥
The plk man niggas gone learn to stop snoozing on dude #goated
You already know!
Nobody is fu_ kin with the P.L.K .   Keep hitting um Lloyd. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This Freestyle has literally made my day… I wasn’t expecting to see Banks on Funk Flex in 2022.
Banks always been nice with a pen, but he is gonna burst from eating, and voice/lungs are decaying from weed. It's not healthy, bro, you can tell self destruction is his path for past 5 years. I am surprised no one approached him from his circle about it.  Voice is getting crunchy, it's no bueno, man.
I don't think he blinked even once while spittin'
That was AZZ!!
My guy plk
Bank$ talk ur sh!!!!t
Banks top 5 MC bars crazy people sleep cause of the lazy flow they aint catch half the gems he spitting
Bloodclat this Nigga kill these smack jacks the greatest
He is so monotone and don’t change his aggression when he rap. Ugh
Banks always been a top tier rapper and STILL GOT IT
30 30 with the zoom hit the man on the moon.
SMH WELCOME BACK BANK$ !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Always been ahead of the game/ The Game, aint have to change with it" light rebuttal to the ex-stripper after that LA leakers freestyle.  Man just released an album called Drillmatic to try n be relevant with the youts 🤣🤡
Banks top 5 living
Top 5
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

100% Goat Wit This !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lloyd Banks
G unit for life banks the plk forever
Why is it so awkward in the beginning, the beat is lame by the way
I swear him and Brian pumper are brothers 🤣 🤣
Bankssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of the goats for sure when it comes bars and track making
Banks is something else. True wizard with that wordplay damn.
Pure 🔥🔥🔥
PLK
10/10🔥
If someone really thinks there’s an MC better at doing what he does show me and explain to me why that’s your opinion. Unless we’re talking black thought he’s literally the only one that’s nice as banks. But all around with what banks does there’s lots of people with him there that are bad but none are surpassing him by much.
a flex do I scared 🔥🔥still favorite line
Anyone know what beat this is?
🔥🌊🐬💦💧 FIRE 🔥🐬WATER!
🔥🔥🔥👑💪🏾
we need another Banks x Em joint
Thank GOD we still have a few real lyricists left!!! Shoutout to the original #PLK #BlueHefner #LamborghiniLloyd #TheBoyWonder

Still cooler than the other side of the pillow 😎
A Hip Hop legend in all aspects.  Arguably one of the best emcees to ever grace the mic.  I've been rocking with Banks for more than half my life and I just turned 33 this year.  The new album has been on repeat, as expected.  Salute.

The Punchline King is dope - but I do like him when he's part of a group of emcees. He's more ferocious!
PLK

😮‍💨💯💯
🔥 SouthSide Jamaica neighbor!

Never seen a ghost in my studio if u catch my drift 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️, cause a ghost Sumn u can’t see in general but he making reference to rappers having ghost writers ... that boy sumn serious
We really gotta hear these old beats all the time tho? Theyre plenty on nice producers banks can rock out to. Damn
🔥🔥🔥
“Sharpening my weapon to protect my gift, never seen a ghost in my studio if you catch my drift, my rap clip too heavy for sneak dissin’ whoever thought clout chasin would have the street shifting, my satellite real bright, I’m deep dishing” 🖊 🖊🖊🖊🖊🖊🖊🖊🖊🖊
Really dope to hear new Banks! come on
Got damn BAnks really the Punch line king The P.L.K is in the building
Banks spit that fire wit no effort
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg this a CLASSIC!!!!!!
Banks is unfuckwitable I’m sorry!
Banks the nicest! 🔥 🔥🔥🔥💰
I could smoke them all but I’m not about to be Illuminati against 🤣
Freestyle but he recorded real freestyles on this beat already
Am I the only one that realizes that his lips won’t matching the words coming out
Immediately saw this on the TL and I know he got some bars for game somewhere in here lol
“I done flew around the world, split backs in Medellin, orange and blue cap, the back says “sale the team” 😆😆😆 James Dolan and the knicks catching strays
30 30 with zoom hit the man on the moon.. Boom! Q borough keep it thorough.. 109 Guy Brew…
Still the best
God bars. PLK 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🥵🔥🔥🔥
Jimmy don’t want smoke with banks
Turn the beat up damn
I’m cool with outcome as long as it’s income🔥
If you grew up listening to rap in the early to mid 00’s you know this man is a lyricist
“Always been ahead of the game, ain’t have to change with it, anywhere they poured out cement, I put my name in it, turned to 6 had to go on my first cage visit, stay out the way cause hollow tips don’t got a age limit, you can be NBA size or Rae sremmurd” 🤦🏽‍♂️
knocked out the holds of all da evil queens n their husbands ....hahahahahah the whole diety
🔥🔥🔥 anybody say otherwise is a hatin ass nigga
That was cool. I gotta gripe with anybody who comes there and sits down to spit. I think you can give better energy standing up to the mic. Just like they used to on RapCity the Basement.   Nevertheless, that was just cool Banks.  Just cool.
Niggas just can't rap with Banks
My dude Davon .....who I named Ghost said you the Best ... we use to battle ur verse vs cassidy z on that mixtapes hahahaah
Still Da Bar King Let’s Goo🔥🔥🫡
PLK!
He said like banks you like 15 to 15 up here

Banks is light years ahead of a lot of these rappers when it comes to spittin , voice, cadence    Etc .  The Game could never be on this level. Tge audacity. This was way better than Games LA Leakers freestyle. I’m sayin Banks is nice
🐐🐐
T.H.E L.L.O.Y.D!🙌

in 1972 beneath the site of what was to become the branch of LIOYDS BANK on Pavement in York, and may be the largest example of fossilised human faeces (palaeofaeces) ever found, measuring 20 centimetres (8 in) long and 5 centimetres (2 in) wide
Yoooooooooo BANKS THE PLK!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Effortless
My number 1 for sure!!!! 🔥 💐
This is for the spitters ⛽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh my bring the ole head back my era!!💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥💰💰💰💰
Ya all need to stop gassing it, for Banks standards this freestyle was mid at best! Not one crazy line that sticks in this whole freestyle
Hard bars🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lloyd always been a real one!
Game is your turn.
Banks is coming after everything he wasn't able to get under 50. But the ones that grew up in that era know Banks will always be G-Unit.
My twin brother, back at it.
Sick When Kobe Died. LaughtWhen Oprah Fell😂😂😂😂
Nahhh he was spazzin I had the mean face the whole time
💯 🙌🏾🙌🏾
BANKS MY DUDE BUT COMPARE THIS FREESTYLE TO GAMES LA LEAKERS FREESTYLE... GO! WHO YOU GOT??
Let’s goooo
One of the greatest rappers ever. PLK BANK$
Average 🤷🏽‍♂️ takes more than some prewritten bars to impress me … where’s the energy , the charisma , the intensity … just was boring , if you gna rehearse like that the least u could do is recite it with more enthusiasm… it’s like he was trying to hard not to mess up … and I’m saying this as a banks fan … but sometimes I see what 50 was talking about and why he never truly reached his potential … lots of niggas can write … not everyone can really spit tho …
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥damn banks
👌💯
“Whoever thought clout chasin will have the streets shiftin. “ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
#187 on a mic. Banks did it again.
“Head so good it’s got a halo 😇 on it” yo!! 🥶🥶🥶🔥
#Coti2 🔥🔥🔥🔥
He needs a cup of coffee.
Legendary 💯
His flow was always and still is A1 for sure. How do you still have a young hungry and  actulized flow after so long? Bruh🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. We want more!
He Alwayz Give Banks Them Weak Old Ass Beats
One if you a teacher to the youth of the game an you see times shifting an young ones going off on older model instruments then embrace new instrumentals an them say something sound like the same old flow. Not impressed. My opinion
Bars on bars 🔥🔥🔥
OMFG!
this is hot 97 freestyle of the year 💯
His first freestyle is the best hot 97 freestyle ever -no debate.
PLK > Ya fave rapper
There's a very shortlist of rappers who's voices are just meant for rap. Banks is one of them...  He could spit the alphabet and make it sound hard af.
🅿️unch 🤙ine  kin👑  ‼️
Banks is the truth💯✊🏿
What’s the instrumental??? I know it’s snoop tho
Banks fire. Didn't have to say his name too nice
This promo run banks on is crazy
Beat was doo doo freestyle was manure
One of the worst yet
🗣️Booooooooooo! Beat was doo Doo 🤦
Legend!!!
Put some Respect on #LloydBanks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😤😤😤 #Underrated 🐐 #QueensGetTheMoney 🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂 #NY❤️💙💤💤
Banks last album dropped a couple years back as was number 1. But nobody spoke on that.
Lloyd Banks just need to sign with Griselda and stop 🐂💩-ing!
Plk forever
I’m about to listen and hear Banks bring that 🔥
That’s the GOAT right there my boy!!!!!!!! FYYYYAAAA!!!!!!! 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Real OG still does it effortlessly
“Stay out the way cuz hollow tips don’t got a age limit/ You can be NBA sized or Rae Sremmurd…” 🔥🔥🔥  Banks is the GOAT and no one can tell me otherwise.
What’s understood ain’t gotta be explained!! I just appreciate him blessing us with ANOTHER ONE!!!! 💙
Damn 🔥🚒

I’m not sure if this comment will go unnoticed but keep me in your prayers please. I used to have 5 brain tumors, but now I have only 1 left to go. In the past I became deaf, and also started having seizures. If you’re reading this I hope things get better for you and your family. 💜
the only time I miss a step is when I skip one🔥🔥🔥🔥
That look in his eye was the look of an effortless kill
Bout time Flex brought a man to freestyle instead of these little boys.
He ain’t gone never lose his touch give that man his roses
his voice is a gimmick. no reason to sound like that. he don't sound like that when he speak. he's a fraud
🚒🚒🚒🚒
I remember a freestyle he did laid over this beat word for word and it was probably better than this.
wordsmith
What is this instrumental???
THE FREESTYLE GOAT
People have to understand that this is not normal. I’m a hip hop head and this level is top 5. Sheeeeeesh 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Flex look sick,,,,
Flex actually got talent guess they opened the wallet for this one instead of the trash they usually push outta this dated platform
The game had the nerve to say he was top 5… even in G-unit he was never lyrically better than Banks. Long Live the Lyricists!
This beat sucks
Everybody @ Jim Jones this link 😮 Tell Jimmy we still ❤ him, but he can gracefully recant his statement about being better than Bank$ and hip-hop won’t hold it against him.
💯💯
Banks still got it that’s that 01-02 flow 💯💪🏿🔥
This Generation needed this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Homie brought out an OG .

PLK 😤
I love this freestyle. However, it would have been more Harding hitting had he been less relaxed and more expressive and open with the hand gestures. You’d have to understand how it works to know what I mean. The verse was 8 out of 10 imo
« Head so good it got a halo » im dooone😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨

Top 5  P.L.K.  Banko Blue Hefner  Lloyd Banks Boy Wonder
Lyoyd is incredibly lyrical and I still continue to barely get through 16 bars without my ears hurting. His voice is dreadful and it is no surprise he doesn't get appreciated for his talents.
We need VADO , FAB, jadakiss , and Benny , and the lobby boys UP HERE
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Banks still one of the greatest 🙌
P.L.K. !!!!!!!! Living legend
Banks is a lagend. He’s been consistently dropping bars  and gems for more than 20 years.  His name is up there with the best. Cats better recognize the greatness.

I always love him & Vado's flow
🔥🔥🔥 Legend P.L.K
Banks the PLK🗽🔥
Plk is back!!!!
This is REAL Talent !!! Not the gimmick drugged out Slow Non talent mid rappers you have today !!! 💯
Lloyd Banks one of the greatest of all time this guy a legend for real
One of the Greatest to ever do it PLK 💪🏿This was Banks showing the Haters and folks like Juelz and Jim Jones that he's on another level of rapping...This was a statement
In the beginning you could hearhe was a lil Rusty but he got a little comfortable and then it was a wrap
Banks has always been one of the best    lyricist in the game since the early 2000's and hes actually able to make good songs and to be honest I have no idea why he actually hasn't blown yet again maybe it's just because of The times and what we listen to now his specific style just doesn't fit in... which is not a bad thing,  I'll forever be a fan #Hungerformore
Yooo is Banks really reading off a tv? His eyes didn’t move the ENTIRE time, locked on something… Great bars but Kinda sketch, not gonna lie…
Best freestyle ever
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
subpar
Lloyd banks is back ayyyeeeeeee
Excellent
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gold diggin plain hoes Looking for the end of rainbows Just call her draino  head so good it got a  halo
I don’t know, after Flex called Conway a “40 year old ‘bars’ rapper”, I don’t even think he deserved this freestyle.

They better stop playing wit Da PLK and put some respect on that man NAME. 🔥🔥🔥 #PLK #Coti2
this nigga is so overrated its not even funny....he has the same flow on every song and his voice does not do anything to help by sounding so lazy.....and his bars were subpar here and his new work is lazy. this is why he will not have a second run like people like the lox and dipset cuz they actually got better while he still sounds the same
I haven't had a stink face for a whole freestyle in awhile.. his metaphors is fuckin insane!! Respect Banks 💯
PLK 💲
No one does it better. PLK!
He gotta update the flow he whispered the flow and didn’t have much growth respect loyd but he still sound like 2001 era .
