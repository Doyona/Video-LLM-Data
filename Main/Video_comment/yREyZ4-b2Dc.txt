Werner actually played as CF at the beginning and then frank put in Tammy which forced Werner out wide and the rest is history, sad to see what has happened to Werner, could and should have been top class striker up there with Mbappe, Haaland etc. If he worked under Klopp or pep, we may have seen a top version of him.
when you skip a game in fifa😂
Werner come back pls
Wow, Werner actually did something
Back when we had a clown in goal, we've come a long way
Who else is watching this to see Werner score nicely again
Werner first of many 😂😂😂😂
Fun Fact: Kepa is a professional goalkeeper
Minaminooooo
In my recommended minutes after 3-3 vs Everton
I love your Videos 😍😍😍
when timo werner knew what football was
Where has that clinical Werner gone
We need this Werner back 😢
why don't chelsea start using the 4-2-3-1 formation again with timo up front. It was actually decent it was just the defence that let us down this game
Kepa mastake
Super, super Frank, Kepa is total wan*  Talking about wan*   Kepa must always have wet dreams because he can't ever keep a clean sheet ( like my pun? ) (Chelsea supporter )
Ings carry Southampton, they would be sh** without him, don't comment on this being like awwww no your so wrong, I don't bloody care, my opinion, just wait until he leaves to a much better club, Kepa can suck his nan, he can't save people sliding into his mum's dm's, so how tf is he going to save a shot, even if it was Morata shooting, don't see why we still have the nob ( I'm a Chelsea supporter )     oh wait it's because nobody will buy him, did you see his save ratio last season? Mendy had a 30% higher save ratio!  But no, of course Mendy was injured, just great!
Go on Walcott
Imagine if VAR had done it's job and ruled out Werner's second for handball. Would have been a great 3 points for Southampton
Kepa trying the goalkeeper role after failing as a manager.
kepa needs to go. period.
Kepa is crap
Don’t care who has the best front three or midfielders, this league is going to be won by the team with the sturdiest defence which on the basis of things so far isn’t any of the “top six”.
Kepa is rubbish for chelsea
Haverts ruined his career. Bayer Leverkusen are a good team I don't know why he had to leave he was doing so well there
Southampton look like the free agent kit from a couple of FIFA’s ago lol
Anyone else feel like Zouma hurt Kepa there?
Lampard out
Doesn’t score in 4 games but in 5th scores 2 nice goals. Get ready to see a lot of Werner from here on.
1:13 and people said Havertz wouldn't be able to create goals in the PL.
UTV that’ll do Barkley 😂😂😂😂
Timo gets a goal in pl and Chelsea didn't win?!
Can’t help watching that Southampton goal for 2-2.  Kepa misses the back pass then actually runs back and missed the ball again. Whoever thought he was world class needs moving on.
noooooooo
What was zouma doing for that second goal? 😳
Kepa out and im am getting tired of frank aswell he is a club legend and now he is ruining that reputation by probably being one of our worst managers ever.
Kepa Kepa Kepa...... Just don’t know how u became world’s most expensive gk deal 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
why are players these days so afraid to kick a ball out for a throw zouma had loads of time to do so to avoid putting pressure on kepa which i dont know what he was doing
Kepa and Pickford fighting for worst goalkeeper ever
??????????
No one picked up ings for first goal. Come on Frank, chelsea got no problem going forward. Defence wise needs shaping up. The scummers played well deserved the point
Second south Hampton goal went of for a corner or goal kick
Wasn't werners 2nd goal a handball?  What a player though.  Mad weekend for number 9's  Kane: 2 goals and an assist Werner: 2 goals and an assist  Rashford: 1 goal and 2assists plus a penalty won.
Does Kepa know he can use he hands to grab the ball? Maybe someone should tell him.
Kepa should just change his name.
As a Tottenham fan .... phew 😅
Sad thing is I think a good manager would win the league with this Chelsea team
Feel sorry for kepa
Zouma did make a big mistake yes but Kepa could’ve easily cleared that but noooooo.
Jesus Christ they need a new keeper it’s ridiculous now
I didn’t even know Walcott went back to Southampton until the equaliser at the end 😱
Wtf is kepa doin AGAIN
WTF is kepa doing??? All good most of the plastic fans blaming the defence but how we meant to win a game with kepa guaranteed to conceded at least 1 goal a game ! 🤷‍♂️ it just ain't football 🤣
How are Chelsea fans blaming Kepa for the second goal? that was a horrific pass back to him, the entire defense is in a shambles and Mendy doesn't come lose to fixing it.
Kepa should have saved all of Southampton's shots
Thank you kepa.
I am sure no crowd gives more goals
kepa still starts for chelse😳
I was typing in kepa and the words that came up were keep and save  such irony
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life..
No fans in attendance and as an Arsenal fan worried about our chances of finishing top yet as strictly a football fan this season has been bloody enjoyable so far! It's been full of shocks and the league title is looking like anybody's at this point. Chelsea have made some great signings, Utd have a reputation to uphold, City are class, Arsenal have improved a lot under Arteta, Spurs has some key goal scorers, Villa still haven't lost or drawn and beating Liverpool 7-2, the best I've ever seen Everton look ever!, Liverpool the current champs, Leicester are a solid team and even Leeds are leaving it all on the pitch even against better teams. Its really exciting times for English football! Every game is unpredictable!
FFS....
Hahahahaha..this Chelsea keeper
Genuinely feel bad for kepa and I’m an arsenal fan
Remember guys THe PrEm aINt reADy
YO EVERYONE PLZ SUBSCRIBE TO ME
Kepa's back I see.
Media for Chelsea's goals - 'amazing play' Media for Southampton goals - 'Chelsea mistakes' hmmmn.
Why is Kepa still with us? Frank needs to off him
Is Kepa even human?😭
That Che Adams goal sums up Chelsea and their defense 🤦‍♂️ absolute shambles
Chelsea badly need a new keeper and a replacement for zouma. They sent him out on loan and he just hasn’t improved
THE EPL IS FUN, best leagues are: 1. EPL 2. Serie A 3. Bundesliga 4. La Liga 5. Ligue 1
where was VAR for werners 2nd goal though?!! obvious handball
Im No Chelsea fan but common the amount of money spent this summer you’d think they would put some of it in a decent goalkeeper. Kepa is literally an embarrassment for that team and at this point I think Willy would do a better job in nets than him. Money well spent on striking force, but defence has a long way to go for them to fight for the top spot again. Before everyone jumps at me I know this is only the start to the season but mistakes like that shouldn’t happen especially game after game
Chelsea really need to replace kepa
Kepa looks like he is on work experience.
Kepa should have been gone the day he refused to come pitch 😎
Kepa’s blunders had me in stitches 🤣
How embarrassing Chelsea defence
WHY IS KEPA PLAYING
Keeps needs to just leave I’m sorry but it’s true
Kepa
This season has actually been quite interesting, the league seems more fair not just one team dominating everything. Well it feels like it I haven’t been watching much
Timo Werner looks like arrived at the prem and has made a great showing with Havertz seeming to have settled , just a shame Kepa is still the keeper
Keeper Envisions Playing Atrocious
Chelsea will win a trophy or two with this team when they get rid of lampard
CLown in a chelsea goal
People might blame kepa for the second one as well as the rest, I totally agree
Positives are Timo scored & harvertz & they linked up well plus pulisic & Ziyech played.
We need to deliver more assists like the 2nd one for Timo that’s what will get the best of him because he has pace to burn & atm he’s having to do everything himself which the 1st goal was an example of that.if we still had fabregas he would’ve been a god send for Timo
Lads .........ITS SOUTHAMPTON FOR PETES SAKE !!!!
0:33 which 5 year old is commentating
Wtf
kepa is trash
Christensen is a massive liability. Weak in the challenge, clumsy, poor positionally and no ability to read the game. Look at his tracking for the second goal, regardless of Zouma's error, the danger hadn't gone. This sums up what he brings to the team.  Why Lampard cannot give Tomori a start, is beyond me. Can we be any worse off defensively???
makes u think about how kepa got through the ranks, actually the worst player ive ever witnessed play at chelsea
Chelsea are being held back by kepa
Can we just quick sell kepa
Adam22 had a great game
Please please please explain, how kepa made it professional ????
Don’t know how that ball stayed on and is that Their new keeper?
Kepa should be fierd
Imagine spending 75 mill on kepa ohh wait never mind.
Imagine being the worlds most expensive goal keeper when you don’t even know what football is 🤣🤣
Kepa literally looks like how my player does on proclubs when I have absolutely no idea how to play as a keeper.
Danny ings still on a madness. Love to see it
Chelsea needs to stop playing kepa he’s just not good enough 🤦‍♂️
kepa on par with adrian
This makes me happy. Chelsea need to get rid of kepa though lol and we need to get rid of Alex McCarthy
Kepa lmaoo
Ok the first goal was kepas fault he got walked around the second goal was kepa fault he couldn't catch a ball the third goals was kepas fault he couldn't stop the lightest shot
Temo verner is unstoppable
Hahah and kepa im happy hes in goal
this 3 sponsorship has gotten out of hand
Kepa, pickford, karius.?
" jorginho, big swingy loopy pass ".
Watching Southampton's second goal, while it's obvious that Kepa could have done a lot better, the thing that frustrates me the most is Zouma. He underhits the pass and then just switches off. If someone like Terry had made that error he would have chased back like his life depended on it. Zouma only started to chase when Adams wasn't able to take the shot, so he was nowhere near him when he scored despite having started side by side.
chelsea still leaky
Up towards Adam Zouma.....who the f is that
I hope that back line and kepa catch a new form of covid and they have to self isolate for the next 6 seasons

Too many attacking players, they will score goals but will concede more . Havertz Werner Chilwell Ziyech Mount Pulisic Kovacic all too attack minded players.  Chelsea are going to get thrashed by a counter attacking team soon.
Kepa is so bad to the point I feel sorry for him, he just can’t catch a break... literally
Lampard OUT!
One of the worst goalkeeping displays ever and not helped by kurt zouma
Kepa producing moments of absolute class again..... 🤣
What is this commentary lmao
Ings was one of my favourite players at Liverpool and he still is one of my favourite players in the world
Im happy with timos and kais contributions but seriously, if we want champions league football we need a goal keeper
Kepa is the worst GK in the top leagues
Kepa with a mistake you don’t say
Kepa is terrible una
Chelsea=most overrated team
Why is Kepa still playing lol?
Chelsea got what they deserved here.
God they need to stop putting Kepa in goal
We warn people about hell because  we don’t want you to go there   we warn you about eternity because it’s forever    we don’t want you to face Eternity without God   you’re a criminal you’re guilty of breaking Gods law every human being is guilty of one thing sin   sin killed Jesus Jesus was without sin but he took on you’re sins and he paid the price for everything you’ve done wrong so that the guilty ones which is us could receive forgiveness and eternal life through Jesus    I urge you to wake up to the signs of the times to give you’re life to Jesus Christ to accept him as lord and Saviour   And To receive Eternal life while you still have time for time is running out
kepa is revenge on the team,he shouldn't be anymore gk,is doing that intentionally
Wow that GK has to go
Finally someone who can score from Jorginho's overhead through balls
Kepa couldn’t save money in an Aldi 🤦‍♂️
It's killing me watching these games without being able to go so depressing and boring anyway I'll be very happy with 3 points today come on u red and white wizards UTB
Kepa and Christensen have to go
Leave it to kepa to throw a 2 goal lead 😂
Adams and ings gonna be a bit of a force this year they are clicking well!  Kepa needs throwing out the club he costs a goal game hes shocking.
chelsea are acctually finished
Frank out bring back sarri
There is absolutely no way Kepa is worth £71m. Wouldn't even pay £7 for him the way he is going
LAMPARD IS CRAP
Does Kepa know he can use his hands?
arsenal sold Theo to Everton, knowing he would go back to Southampton and equalise against Chelsea. Papa Wenger has done it again.
It’s crazy to think the most expensive goalkeeper in history is also statistically the worst keeper in premier league history. What were Chelsea thinking
We can slater Chelsea however we want, but is no one gonna talk about how solid chillwell looked
Awww damn it Chelsea shouldve wom
If INGS keeps this up, Klopp will do a swap deal for Firmino 😏🤣
Can we all give Werner a clap for finally scoring?!  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
00:08 this goal is so hazard liked
Since Vestergaard had a hair cut he's turned into a beast  !!!
Kepa is absolutely shite!
I’m a city fan, but I cannot help but point out that assist from Jorginho, that was brilliant 👏
My two cents:  - Chelsea aren't fit enough to last an entire game at the moment. - Chelsea need to adopt a gegenpressing style. Their attacking half weren't doing much to win the ball back, especially during the second half.  - They're too reliant on starting all the way back to the defence to create opportunities. Was frustrating to see the ball get to the midfield, only to have it passed back again to start from scratch and eventually get intercepted. - By the looks of things, the defence has no disciplined form. Again this got exposed in the second half when Southampton had an answer for Chelsea's question. As a result  you had Kante as a box to box midfielder driving himself all the way to the back to compensate for Chilwell's mistakes yet in contrast you had Azpi a Fullback (maybe wingback) turning himself into an midfield Inverted Winger or even at points an attacking Inside Forward to compensate for the fact that Jorginho isn't playing to his strengths.   But Jorginho is not like Kante, Jorginho is a Deep Lying Playmaker and therefore needs to be in the centre of a defensive midfield role. So what Lampard needs to do is avoid this formation next time vs. 4-4-2 and try a 4-3-3 or 4-3-2-1 formation. He needs 3 defensive midfielders instead of 2, narrowed up, with Kante on the left Jorginho in the middle and maybe Azpi on the right. Thiago Silva will be the new leader for the defence line in Azpi's place. The front 3 can be a dangerous combination of Havertz/Mount, Werner/Tammy and Pulisic/Ziyech. And the best part is, with the squad they have, a rearrangement in line up could turn defensive midfield onto an attacking midfield (Ziyech, Havertz, Mount) ready to pass to the front three Werner, Tammy, Pulisic. How dangerous would that be?  - Finally, Zouma, Havertz and Kepa made costly mistakes that conceded goals. But the former two balanced their game out with contributions made. Whilst Kepa made a few decent saves, it annoys me he failed to recover Zouma's shoddy pass and failed to the save the final goal. He can never seem to position himself properly between the goalposts (which is exactly what he needs because as far as GKs are concerned he's a midget and his fingertip strength isn't exactly great, either).
I can't believe Chelsea didn't win Tottenham beat Southampton 5-2 Chelsea should of done the same lol 🤣
Kepa.  The Spanish Pickford.
Sometimes i think Kepa does his errors on purpose to punish chelsea fans.. long as he is getting oaid he is good
tactically lampard seems sound. but player selection is a shambles. and we have no good cb and a proper dm.
The price Chelsea paid for Kepa thread.16 La Ferraris (£2m) , 4 Pagani Huayras  (2m), 6 Koeniseggs agera rs (£1.5m) & 8 Bugatti Chirons (£2.5m)·
Kepa is bloody terrible 🤯
Frank maybe try not playing Zouma you might find Keps will only let in 1 then
So bad Kepa
Kepa no longer a good kepa
Frank Lampard is the 21st centuries version of Kevin Keegan's Newcastle. Score plenty concede just as much. Useless..
Can we just appreciate Werners first goal? That run was class and a great finish to match it
Love that saints away kit
Chelsea bottled the water out
Kepa is just too good for the prem
Werner looks great, shame he’s playing for such a nothing team
We should sack kepa my god
You guys really need a thesaurus. The English language contains many words other than "thriller."
Get kepa out disaster as always
Ok i knew kepa was bad but jesus christ this game so atrocious
Kepa is a liability
Ik
Wow kepa again geez
Omg kepa is so bad why did ment have to get injured 😢😢that should have been a easy 3 points
Wtf is wrong with Kepa man
Kepa was awful once again
Kepa 😧 shockingly crap 💩... We need him out! I wish him well, but not @ CFC we have given him enough bloody chances! He is gonna kill the team morale n motivation ~ after such hard work 😓 he let the lads down 😩
Is kepa a defender.. 😂
We need to get rid of kepa he only makes mistakes
Saints were the *last* non-'Big Six' team to score at Stamford Bridge when they won 0-2 last December. So Chelsea haven't been that bad in defence at home. Well played Saints they recovered well. Good team.
I'm not saying Kepa is bad but you've got a better chance of seeing a clean sheet at a Bukkake party
Kepa is never a goalkeeper absolute pish
I'm sorry but that's Walcott's goal at the end.
Why did Zouma stop running after he had the mistake for Southampton's second goal? He would had stopped that second goal if he kept on running.
Kepa needs to go
Chelsea held 3-3 via Southampton whom fought back from 2 -0 down to draw.
Kepa 😂
Chelsea spent over 250mill in the summer and are still bottling wins🤦‍♂️😂😂
All 3 goals kepa could have done better. That’s unfortunate.
That man Kepa! My flipping kitten has a better chance of saving shots than him, even baldy caballero is better than this trash 80mill player man. Do 1!👍🏽😂
Kepa couldn't even save a word document.
It’s so easy to blame kepa but we have to start blaming lampard as well. 5 games in and he still doesn’t know his best 11. Constantly changing the lineup isn’t going to get you anywhere.
1:56 he first missed the ball  Then missed the ball again and 2 footed the goal post  What the f***
Now that werner is starting to settle in he looks unreal
Glad to see Walcott bag one, Everton fan! good on him!
Kepa is shite
Chelsea's goal keeper non existing 😂
Chelsea's squad assembles up to £200m+, yet a defensive unit and a goalkeeper who cost £75m continue to contribute to the awful amount of goals conceded last season. Embarrassing
Kepa is the definition of a player who doesn’t deserve the money he gets 😡
timo werners first goal was very smart turning the defender 👏
I now truly believe Karma is real, Kepa thought he was funny refusing to come off the field for Sari....If only he knew lmfao.
God Kepa’s awful
Kepa over 70 mil 🤣
Anyone else not know Walcott had gone to Saints?
Lampard needs to sort out that defence pronto
This Chelsea team just can’t put teams away
Love the big swingy loopy passes
LOOL I don’t know if Kepa is tryna be a Goalkeeper or a Comedian
I genuinely thought that was hazard😂
I don’t know how people really think Chelsea are title contenders
Kepa is a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lamps will be next prem manager to get the sack
Kepa is my favourite goalkeeper at the moment 🤣
No one going to talk about how good that 2nd Chelsea goal was ??
That Southampton 2nd could be a FIFA goal. Calamity.
We need to just cut our losses with Kepa.
All 3 goals are just terribly defended by kepa
Oh god kepa
Chelsea really love that number of their kit sponser
Kepa we love u
Kepa needs to get the Fuk out moms
Timo Werner with a textbook execution of the R1 FIFA skill move at 0:06
Just when you think Kepa can't get any worse...
Kepa couldn't catch a cold
*Southampton haven’t scored 4 past Chelsea since 2002*  Kepa: Mission failed we’ll get em next time
Kepa for the 2nd goal had be dead
Zoumas had a 'mare eh?
Loooool chelshit back at it again🤣🤣🤣
Glad to see the rent boys flopping
1st Werner goal - Goal of the Month there
If In doubt. Blame the keeper lol
I can’t be the only person who thinks frank lampard is a shite manager
Man U got Maguire and we got Kepa 🙄
WHAT IS KEPA?!?!?!
Didn’t even notice Zouma literally walking and watching on that 2nd goal, inexcusable. That’s worse than Kepa’s gaffe. I didn’t even notice it til now. He would’ve prevented the goal had he got back.
Would've watched it but you tried charging £15. I've now cancelled Now TV sports. Ram it
If you sold every single player on my clubs books, it wouldn't quite cover 1/5 of Kepas transfer fee. And he wouldn't even get on the bench
Timo Werner is class !!! ✌🏾✌🏾✌🏾 what a beast. On the other hand. Kepa is the worst keeper ever lol they should replace him
Why weren't they playing Mendy??
And people slate de gea... kepa is a joke
Kepa is a shambles
kepa masterclass 👏
Gotta be honest kepa lost Chelsea the win there
Kepa 😂 This poor guy. Feel so sorry for him, having the worst time ever.  Look, these guys get paid a huge amount of money i know. But i hope Kepas mental health is OK. Must be distraught with the form he is in.
Kepa has to be one of the worst Goalkeepers i have ever seen
Kepa is the worst keeper to grace this earth, no effort at all for that last goal, watches it then dives at it when it's already in the net
It just gets worse every week for Kepa 🤣
Please god, please bring back the old Chelsea. The one where we won trophies and had world class players.
I think a traffic cone would do a better job than kepa in goal
Chelsea would do better to just ditch their 2 centre backs and put 2 more up front. Just get Terry back
I’m a Chelsea fan, I think kepa is the worst keeper in the league
This is more Lampard's fault than anyone else's. It's obvious he's unable to coach defensive positional play because any time Chelsea lose the ball in midfield the opposition is one decent pass away from a shot on goal. Zouma and Christensen also can't keep concentration for a full 90+ minutes, unreliable pair for a team wanting to compete for titles and do bits in Europe.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing but you should've brought back Ancelotti who has a plan and works player into a cohesive system rather than the current, favourite PE teacher 👀
Oh my goodness 😳 kepa really.
A PS1 memory card could’ve saved those last 2 goals cmon kepa
This team of Chelsea is wery good but the only problem is like there goal is empty all the time is no goalkeeper on him kepa just disappear pal you are disgrace 😂😂
The positive thing is Chelsea finally found decent striker  Timo Werner
He's such a good goal keeper MashaAllah
Kepa will be the death of me!! 💩💩
1:57 Zouma’s having a walk in the park 😂😂
Kepa is dogshit
ケパはスーパーグレートコメディアンだ！
FFS! Enough with sponsorship jokes!
Southampton did well 👏🏽
Walcott with the assist back where it all began🤩
Chelsea are to passive , Timewasting in the 82nd minute when theres openings - Get a grip lampard.  Also southamptons fitness levels were superior
Kepa is just complete ass 🤷‍♂️ I’d feel sorry for him if he wasn’t getting paid 200k a week lol
I feel sorry for kepa but not for Adrian.
Lampard is championship manager
Who gave the Chelsea free kick away?
mason mount is gonna be like that 28 year old bum loftus cheek.
Kepa nah nah nah I can’t accept dat
Is that the worst goalkeeper ever in a Chelsea shirt..no shot stopper..dont claim crosses..and a damn right chicken when confronted..useless.
How on earth did Kepa make that mistake in that second Southampton goal? how is it possible to miss the ball? He literally slid past it as though deliberatly?? poor guy isnt cut out for big league football
haha i have a ones to watch werner 😏😁
Kepa and Pickford mistakes in the same week. Whod have thought it
" its a mistake from kepa" is just a weekly occurance at this point
Get kepa out of goal! We need a new keeper badly
Zostawcie tego keppe.cala obrona jest do wymiany a co taki drewniak jak zouma robi w tej druzynie to tylko frank wie to jego bramka a nie keppy
Kepa has to go
Kepa will cost Chelsea everything
Jesus Kepa is actually so bad
Werner is showing what's he is made of. 2 goals and 1 assist... Wow
I hate that Southampton copied the Peru football kit
Kepa is honestly one of the worst if not the worst goalkeeper I’ve ever seen
Kepa is shocking
One word kepa 😂
Why does lampard play kepa? Yes I know Mendy is injured but what's wrong with Cabello, there's no one worse than kepa as a keeper, he will lose games and points for Chelsea every time he plays, and its lampard who picks him
Birmingham fan and happy to see Adams score wish we still had him but he’s doing great now
Wth is wrong with Kepa???
Chelsea fans looking at Kepa when there’s a perfectly incompetent manager to blame.
What’s the point of having the highlights if you didn’t show the game
That’s not a great assist, it’s a slight better boot up field
Chelski chucking away points this season..
Why did Chelsea but there manager in net?
Kepa needs to go! So inconsistent...Worst keeper we have had...
Wan Bissaka scores: great finish there from wan Bissaka  :Werner scores: GREAT RUN FROM WERNER THATS WHAT HE CAN DO THATS THE FIRST OF MANY FOR THE BEST STRIKER IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE
Kepa couldn't catch a virus
werners turn😍
Only using one sub Frank must have thought he was Pep back in the day game in the bag. Kepa is a shambles and how the hell Christensen in the team again guy confidence is gone has not got the mental strength for the shirt more like a squad man at least when you are winning 4-0 put him on for the last 5 minutes anything more he will cost you the game he must have shares in Chelsea heard the board like him what madness. Frank needs to make up with Rudiger very quick he will be needed to save his job when Silva comes back he will get run ragged this is not the French league . I have a funny feeling the players Chelsea brought this summer are not Franks but the boards think about it  Roman was desperate last season with the transfer ban needed a man and through Frank to the lions after only one season with Darby worrying already, as a Chelsea fan I was happy Frank came back but I was still a bit sceptical not as assistant to learn the ropes 1st. Frank as manager in 19/20 we conceded  54 goals and scored 69 thats poor 20 different defensive line ups in 40 odd league games also got Jody Morris as assistant got to do better. This season the writing is in the wall conceded 9 goals and scored 13. The youth from last season are know wear in sight  Abraham hit a nice load of goals last season but the board still went got Werner hope Tammy has the mental strength like Drogba did when he had to fight off Shevchenko and Torres did help players turned out terrible so Drogba done his thing but Werner is a different level the man means business to hold down a place will be hard. CHO needs to play wasted talent. Mount needs to be rotated sometimes not a good look to always keep playing him some fans will turn on him and say managers favourite especially if he is not doing nothing. Players will throw Lampard under the bus after a while like Lampard, Terry and Drogba used to do to the previous Chelsea managers.
Werner absolutely sent some of their players 2 class goals, happy for Kai but typical, our mistakes let us down, notice how we don’t even ask Kante to track back which is an issue
Chelsea,,what a joke!!
1:58 now where have I heard that one before
Tbh the mistake was made from Zouma. That back pass was terrible. Kepa did well not to be sent off.
Chelsea need a new goal kepa
I think Kepa might be worse than Roberto. At least the latter cost us nothing.
The day kepa makes his first save will be great lmfao
Please pray for Kepa
Kepa was bad but I blame Zouma for the goal lazy as hell he could have got back and had a cup of tea and got the ball away in one go  FFS even when we score 2 I still think we need a 3rd or a 4th to be safe in a game.
i’m sorry but don’t blame kepa blame zouma it’s his faukt
It’s clear that Rudiger is chelsea best defender why is he not in the team thats got to be poor management by Frank
Kepa must be he worst 70 million pound signing ever.Utter shite.
Howler from Kepa but sh!tty back pass too before that. Did no one else see that? Suddenly everything is his fault.
We need to permanently bench Kepa for the greater good, look at the second goal...he made 3 mistakes within 3 seconds
kepa is officially worse than karius
Kepa must leave.
KEPA OUT!
Timo Werner man beautiful
That 2nd was completely zoumas fault
I was going to say that kepa is still young but he’s 26, he should be approaching the prime of his career
The Three sponsorship is going too far now.
Chelsea don't have an issue with scoring goals but they do with conceding goals! Defensively they are exposed and Kepa needs to go!
coming from a chelsea fan kepa is absoloute 🐶💩💩💩
Kepa Arrizabalaga,  Footballs second most expensive Goalkeeper in the whole world !!  Currently in Pole position with Another Spanish    Goalkeeper at Liverpool  Adrián in the How many mistakes can we make Competition.
Taking the 3 sponsor seriously again
That boy in nets will cost chelsea dearly
Kepa has to be up there with Karius and Adrian for the worst GKs in the world, I swear he makes a mistake every game.
My Sunday league keeper is better than kepa
Timo Werner looks a fantastic player.. 2 goals and an assist. Man ran them ragged.
Frank Lampard during half time: Stick to the sponsorship!
Iff only they had mendy in goal no way would that  happen
growing increasingly convinced my FPL decisions influence real world football. Literally ditched Werner before this match. SIGH
Another brilliant performance by kepa
Arsenal fan Timo Werner is a world class for me.
what a terrible goal keeper..
Nah I'm not a Chelsea fan but kept needs to go
Kepa is just bad luck
Kepa is a friking plum in goal
Lampard is out of his depth when its a real league and not the Championship. Joke of a manager 🤣
That's what you get when you spend over £200 million on attacking midfielders and forwards but are unwilling to spend a penny on a Central Defender.(Yes, I know about Malang Sarr, but he is not ready for the first team yet). Is Lampard the new Wenger?
Nice to see that they give Kepa plenty of chances, such a great professional. Would be a shame to see him harshly dropped...
Another kepa masterpiece
Kepa needs sacking
Even the mali 2nd division relegation battling team have a better goalkeeper than Chelsea
Kepa let's 3 goals in Three : we like that
If Roy Keane was a Chelsea fan...
Lampard' out of his depth
We should give kepa away for free he's not worth selling 72 mil for that jokeman
Oh dear what comedy for sou second goal🤣😂🤣😂😂fine keeper and defender weeks wages it was that hilariously bad
Kepa is as good as VAR
Well done Southampton!
Kepa is the worst keeper in the prem
Well done Theo welcome back to your really own club of your Heart . The Saints .
It just gets worse for kepa like...dont think Chelsea have had troubles with keepers ever...but since Czech went my days
Werner looks like Gudjohnsen from a distance.
Yes Walcott
Madre mía Kepa que malo es. He entrado pensando que un gol al menos era una cantada suya y ve que efectivamente
its like watching chesnoid playing fifa 21
Even a pub team wouldn’t buy kepa
Last goal bounced twice before it went in and kepa still couldn’t save it🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Kepa is so unlucky.
I thought Chelsea signed  new keeper. Were is he
Think id rather have adrian over kepa yeno
200 million 😂😂😂😂
Kepa is absolute dog. None of them goals needed to be conceded if there had been a decent keeper in net. Why didn't mendy play
unpopular opinion: Chelsea wasting German talents
Kepa out
What a mess 🤦
Unpopular opinion: kepa should retire
Terminate Kepa’s contract
I think Kepa forgot he was a goalkeeper in that game. The first goal he has gone down to early and can't react quick enough for me and he's started playing footsies with the post for the second. Almost like an undercover spy for the opposition 🤔
Great comeback Saints. 2 great results of late. Hopefully the start of good results.
The Chelsea defence will have sore bottoms tonight after big frank punished them
1:56 FS Kepa!! As bad as De Gea's first couple of seasons but Fergie backed him then
I think a dog can do better then kepa
Beating Southampton isnt for everybody
Are people still actually making jokes about Kepa being manager and Chelsea’s shirt sponsor? 🥴
Get rid of Kepa he is so bad
Jorginho could be the key man for assists this season, unreal vision for that second Werner goal
Kepa baffles me, is he purposely trying to be the Phil jones of goalkeepers
Kepa
Kepa with another calamity it’s hilarious if your not a Chelsea fan
Why dont the club just hire JT and teach these players how to defend
Just hit target  kipper will let it in
Kepa is the worst goalkeeper in the history no just of Chelsea but the Prem he’s that bad
Arsene Wenger sells Theo Walcott to Everton, leaves Everton to join saints and steals two points from Chelsea. Wenger has done it again.
ZOUMA is at fault for not clearing the ball with the defender on him. Sold Kepa short.  James is at fault for giving away a set piece freekick so late in the game for the equalising 3rd Goal.  But lets put all the blame on Kepa. Deluded Chelsea fans,
Jew goal chelsea
I know everyone is shitting on Kepa (and rightfully so) but how good did Timo Werner look playing through the middle?!
Again Kepa? This is getting ridiculous. Is Lampard being forced to play with him?
Chelsea spent so much on attack but there defense is so leaky
Kepa or Zouma, I'm not sure who was worst?
Do you think there is a single person who has kepa in their FPL team
What is kepa even doing
1:58 horrible denfending
Keeps wasn’t great but let’s be real, it was zouma’s fault for goal 2  Spend big on a cb next summer, please
SACK FRANK!!
This season is by far the most exciting
200+ million and forgot to patch that leak at the back and move the fat fraud on... You love to see it 😂🤣😂
Can we just quick sell Kepa? Like I don’t mind getting him for discard value
The German Partners!
Kepa is practically useless :/
How bad is kepa? 60+ million? This guy is a shambles i might even become a goalkeeper
Kepa’s a prick
I feel bad for kepa he has 0 confidence
If in doubt clear it out that's what we lacked honestly
WHY IS KEPA BLOODY PLAYING
Kepa ffs
A chelsea Southampton game without Oly Geroud breaking our hearts :D
Finally timo got a goal
BRO KEPA OUT THE DOOR WE NEED A NEW MANAGER
Lamps has got to learn how to put a game to bed when 2-0 up. He’s a legend at the bridge and I would love him to be our most successful manager ever but this can’t go on. Kepa is nothing short of a complete and utter disaster..whoever bought him should be out of a job.
I literally had to put my eyes to the screen to check if it was Hazard wearing No.10 lol
Most of these goals had the keeper getting humiliated
Nice to see Walcott score, I had forgotten about him....
Kepa please wtf u doing
This Chelsea team is a disgrace
There’s no reason Pulisic should be stuck on the right he should of been on the left like when Ziyech came on
Can't wait for Angry Rantman to butcher Kepa OUTzabaggla.
Kepa Maguire and Pepe are in competition this season to see who the bigger waste of money was
Abramovich should buy an old big Soviet bus, it will work better than this bunch of clowns.
Is it me or does the Southampton kit remind you of the free agents kit on fifa? 😂
You will always get chances against that weak Chelsea back 4 and another keeping mistake again shocking ..
Overpaid and overrated the lot of them
Havertz and  Werner have drawn 4 times in their last 5 matches and 3 of them ended 3-3. Coincidence? I think not
Another masterclass from Kepa!
How much did Chelsea pay for their team today?
Chelsea's attack = 🔥 Chelsea's defence = 💩
Let’s all remember that man United lost to Tottenham and Crystal Palace respectively, with United taking 6 from Tottenham, so I don’t wanna hear any United fans slagging of chelsea
kepa is crap but those centre backs are equally rubbish the mistake they made are laughable, they are experienced defenders mistaking absurd mistakes.
kepa is GARBAGE
Cech should off played
Great match!! Ings is one of the most underrated players ever!! I would happily play him on my team!!!
Chelsea will score 3 and let 3 in ... that's network 3.... LMAO 🤣🤣🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😄😄😆😁😁
Kepa the gift that keep on giving lol
The traffic cone next door that uni students stole would be a better keeper then Kepa.
Kepa 😂
Absolute state of Kepa.
You can watch highlights from EVERY Premier League game of the season on the Sky Sports Football YouTube channel, the playlist is here ► http://bit.ly/SkySportsPLHighlights2021
"mistake by kepa"  Don't hear that too often
This isn’t even a joke anymore.
I think Kepa is garbage but that second goal was all Zouma's fault he needed to kick it into touch
Either Kepa doing it on purpose now or Lamps really shuts this boy confidence down or was just a hype
Sponsor must be ecstatic with this level of consistency
Kepa Kepa Kepa Kepa again and again
Last time i was this early, theo walcott was playing for arsenal
"It's a mistake by Kepa" Now where have I heard that before?
I can why Chelsea went with 3 as their shirt sponsor- it’s how many they aim to concede per game.
Chelsea have a good squad but won't be winning trophies with kepa in goal 😂
I'm actually ashamed to be a chelsea fan at this point. I can see Lampard getting sacked 😓
Chelsea have one of the most promising attacking sides in Europe. But if they invest into a proper World Class Goalie and some decent centre halves then they are in with a shot to win the League and contenders for the Champions League?
GET KEPA OUT OF MY CLUB omg he's been disastrous since he came ffs
Werner is absolutely a baller.. I knew he was gonna be as good as his showing.. not just talking in a Chelsea shirt but for his international duty .. his quick and powerful definitely a promising star ⭐️
I’m more or less expecting Kepa to do something crazy every game😂 Zouma kinda initiated it but still comical from Kepa
" A big, swingy, loopy pass"   and whoever said commentator standards are falling?
Why wasn't Cech playing in goal?
Still no old firm highlights although it was earlier
Fat franks days are numbered
Kepa just needs to go
200m to draw 3-3 with southampton lmao
Thank god people are only looking at how bad kepa is. Zouma with a big sigh of relief tonight
Another mistake from kepa
I dont know why Lampard keeps excusing kepa and his mistakes, hes been poor for over a year and a half, surely it's time to cut ties with him or atleast loan him out. Time and time again when we need him to bail our defense out of silly errors he makes matters worse...if anything I think he puts our defense on edge and makes them more nervous...how many times have we passed it back to kepa and fluffed it, then a goal results from it...I've had enough honestly...it makes the defenders look worse than they really are and it makes lampard look clueless, this blind faith he has in kepa is going to get him sacked
Only blame the goalkeeper despite Chelsea defence having no cohesion or protection.
Chelsea can't kep a clean sheet
haverts is overrated
Who u picking Adrian Kepa or Pickford ?
Why is Kepa on the pitch 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 get Mendy on
Is it just me or is Danny Ings better than firmino
Werner 🤝💨
Theo. Great point for Southampton. Just proves all money and still cannot beat mid table teams.
Did no one else notice the ball went off the pitch for Southamptons second??
I'm still trying to figure out what Kipper Kepa was doing for Southampton's 2nd goal? Weird!!
cost me 60 quid that theo thanks pal, rat.
It’s embarrassing for kepa now, he doesn’t even look like a professional keeper😂😂
Should’ve been Walcotts goal 🤦‍♂️
So glad ings has found form and fitness, class player
How is kepa meant to build confidence when the 2 cbs in front of him are just as bad. Kepa maybe came out too soon for ings goal but the cbs may as well have been on separate planets he just walked through. Zouma left kepa out to dry with a shocking back pass .kepa shouldve done better and put his laces through it but this a confidence sticken gk. 3rd goal perhaps not much he could do about it.
Werner is class, but kepa is the worst goalkeeper I've ever seen in the premier League
Absolute horrific goalkeeping, 1st goal havertz gets dispossessed which can happen kepa literally misses the player when he slides out....., for the 2nd goal kepa could have easily covered for zoumas mistake of a pass and literally slides past it, for 3rd goal kepa does his usual thing he conceded an easy bouncy slow lonsghot, absolute disaster and people wonder why I am critical towards kepa. He provides no cover and barely ever saves anything, no matter who the in field player is they might give away things eventually no matter how good or bad they are but the goalies job is to protect and cover, something kepa constantly fails to do over and over again, kepa out, rudiger out, christensen out, alonso and emerson out. All of them are bottle jobs and don't have enough quality to play for chelsea right now, they have been so dead for the last 2 years, TIME TO GO!!!!!! They have costed us so dearly for too long, I want improvement, top4 and a trophy and eventually to compete in league, nobody wins a league with these accidents waiting to happen.
Kepa the gift that keeps on giving
Frank Lampard's rule: stick to the sponsorship.
Chelsea would easily be title contenders if they had a better defense
Glad to see Theo Walcott settling well at Southampton.
Kepa wouldn’t get in a cub scouts team he is desperately poor.
I think Chelsea are better of playing the match without a goalie as Kepa is giving the team a false sense of security..
Kepa on ice 》 Dancing on Ice.
Chelsea are taking their sponsorship with Three far too seriously. Really.
kepa loooooooooooool
Timo Werner is a beast not a Chelsea fan btw
That second Southampton goal was absolutely hilarious
Chelsea, chocolate teapot defence.
Kepa is losing them games
Chelsea need immediately new goalkeeper!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡
1:57 In other stunning developments, water is wet.
Kepa playes like when ur forced to go in net in school n u have to concede to  change over
Kepa was man of the match
So... why was kepa playing?
Kepa is still better then overrated flapper Pickford because at least legs are not nearly broken on the way out.
Kepa is terrible
Frank might not be around for long
Chelsea are piss poor
Kepa is piss poor even a Sunday league keeper could pull more saves than him or at least clear the ball...
Got to move Kepa on....
Just quick sell kepa. I’ve had enough
There are good players at Chelsea, would be a shame to see talent wasted
Kepa costed us the game
This is why kept is shut get mends in goal
Surprising that Chelsea aren’t defensively solid.
Timo showed his class today just need to find his feet
Kepa is less useful than Alexander lacazettes shampoo
Well played saints 💖
Cant wait until man united vs chelsea with the worse defence for both teams and good attackers
Imagine drawing 3-3 to southampton, could never be my club
kepa useless
Wtf chelsea have an amazing transfer window which hyped us all up and they aren't winning
HA HA HA WHO'S BEEN SHOCKING NOW CHELSEA! 😆😆😆😆😆
Kepa again 🤣
Chelsea ain't as good as Tottenham this year...
No one: Sky sports titles : game draws in 0 goal thriller. Adrian’s  mistake helps the other team score. Controversial disallowed goal allows this team to draw Controversial red card sends your mum off. Last gasp winner from (This player) (This player) helps (this team) steak the win in a astonishing derby.
Can’t wait to see these dumbass John Abraham comments
Why did Chelsea new GK not play today? Injured?
Can someone tell kepa that he is allowed to use his hands please .... Apparently he does not know that he can save the ball
why is kepa still on that chelsea team is beyond me
Chelsea got to tighten their defence.
Another crazy assist by havertz.
What a match
is it just me or are we seeing  greater goals scored in lockdown.. if you wanna attract the fans back, that's the way to do it. :-)
Well-done saints ... ..  ! Chelsea all at sea brilliant smelling of fish
Get rid of VAR
Chelsea is cursed by 3 Mobile 🤣🤣
Kepa is shite
That Che Adams goal was so avoidable from Chelsea
How does Kepa keep getting started? He is atrocious, not even a Chelsea fan but it hurts to watch him play.
I can see Frank being sacked
Yet again a tap in from havertz is what Chelsea need
KEPA, LOL
I take Werner out my fantasy team and he does this ffs
KEPA, LOL
kepa needs to go , hes not performing
Kepa, kepa, kepa, always making mistakes 😒🙄 bored of it now, atleast we have Mendy to take his place
K****E****P****A       O****U****T
I haven’t seen the post match but I know it already ““It was a disappointing result errr Indivial errors errr but good to score 3 goals, errr we are a young side eeer but we showed great fight errrr” can’t lie, it’s the same stuff every game.
Not the first time chelsea drawed 3-3 this season 😉
The 3 on Chelsea’s kit do be hitting scorelines
Kepa.....
Chelsea defence 😂😂😂😂
Wow
The 2:2 is one of the stupidest defense performances I have ever seen. Zouma, Kepa and Kepa again, what were they doing there?
Why is kepa still playing for Chelsea
Chelsea FC is better than  man United
we thought that david degea is bad oh no kepa is just a whole new level
How is Christiansen a CB way too skinny and weak. This guy has been at Chelsea for years. At what point do you say he’s not good enough. I believe in this project. I wouldn’t say Lampard out because I am not a prisoner of the moment. I’ll allow him one more season so he can sort out the back 4 like he did with the attack and that’s it. Also Kante and Jorginho not good enough. Well Jorginho specifically. We allow way too much space behind our mid. He just isn’t strong enough to challenge or fast enough to get back. We need a cdm who is strong physically and tall but not attack minded like RLC and Barkley.
Shout out to me who took both werner and ings out my fantasy team
Can any Chelsea fans tell me why Rudiger is not playing? Is Lampy didn't fancy him?
Kepa literally couldn't stop a soft backpass!
3-3 same as west brom
Silly mistakes from kepa coming all the way outside the box even zoumas one but hope they learnt from there mistake
Seriously? I just took Werner of my fantasy team. Ffs
tghe last goal was zumas fault. If he dealt with it better Kepa wouldnt have had to come out of his in the fist place but it still doesnt excuse his mistake.
Ings is quality. Liverpool were mad to let him go
That kepa is terrible he was at fault of 2 goals again hes costing Chelsea some points
Lampard is an inferior coach, he only became chelsea coach because he is English .He will soon be sacked ,he should go back to the championship
Compare our big-money Spanish signings (Kepa, Morata, Torres) to our big-money German signings (Werner, Havertz)
Kepa 🐐
Im starting to worry that someone has turned down Kepa's goalkeeping ability sliders
Play 5 at the back, 3 forwards at top
Wenger sends his regards
i dont get it the first 35 minutes even the whole first half we played so well....fair play to southampton though they deserved the point
Games this season have been quality, still can’t believe that Merseyside derby, Liverpool robbed
Get him out of our goal we will lose 70mill every season we play him just by the amount of league places he costs us
Werner finishes were so good tbh
Up the saints 😇
Kepa such a donkey!
Kepa is shite 😂
Chelsea could be dangerous without Kepa
Did Chelsea play Southampton today or Peru??
Jorginho had an excellent game probably the best I’ve seen him play so far
At this rate Roman won't be very pleased.
Kepa really is proper gash! 💩
Why is kepa still at Chelsea😐
Standard of defending in in Premiership is very poor
Yet again Walker Peters forgets to track back
If messi or Ronaldo scored werners 2nd goal that would off been talked about for years... What a goal.
Im loving this premier league season with brighton being my shout for premier league winners
Kepa is still crap then
Anyone here after watching Angry Rantman
I h8 this sponsor
How is a great keeper like Romero number 4 at United but Pickford and Kepa still manage to blag their ways into Everton and Chelsea’s first team.
Is Mendy injured? I was very surprised seeing Kepa in goal
When is Frank going to face facts Zouma is utter shite most of our defensive issues stem from him yet still gets picked week in week out.
It’s just like watching Peru!
How did Chelsea get the Arsenal defence to play for them ?
Kepa is goat
Do Chelsea have a defence?
Kepa plays???wtf      another mistake
No matter how much Chelsea spend, they'll never be a top 6 club😂 they gotta change it to top 2 bcos all the others don't do anything special😂
Three is really holding chase to ransom
Three goals and still we can't get three points, shocking.
Kepa did well to stake another chance at being number one.....not! 🤦
Chelsea, please sell this rubbish goalkeeper. Immediately!
I give up with this team 😂
Bought ziyech for £35 and he sits on the bench   Why didn’t they buy a bloody defender? Idiots
I loved pirating this game
2:25 who thought that was hazard
Guys , give Kepa a break please . It's not easy being a manager and a goalkeeper at the same time.
I regret moving Werner from my FPL team
Fu.king Kepa...
1:58 words heard in every chelsea game
Keppa is the most mistake prone gk I've seen play.
Seeing the Chelsea fans blame kepa for all 3 on insta ? 🤔...... he’s only to blame for one here don’t know what game their watching
Kepa is just taking the piss at this point lmao
Danny Ings deserves more credit
I didn't think Timo Werner would outclass Ings in a game this season. I also didn't think the PL would see a worse keeper than Simon Mingolet 😂
Frank gonna be out of a job next month
Lampard spending £300 mill for draws 😂
Kepa is an idiot.what is the point of him playing football
Theo did it for arsenal
Kepa is beyond terrible
Someone tell me how kepa its the expensive gk ij the world loool
another 3-3. The 3 sponser is doing the magic
People will blame kepa and rightly so but I have to ask why we consistently play christensen over tomori? Not only that stupid decisions from frank like playing pulisic on the right and so on. He is really starting to piss me off and as a fan I don't want him to get sacked but he has to stop making stupid decisions.
Absolutely comical defending from Chelsea
Chelsea have spend loads of money this season after spending none in the last and they'll be nowhere this season. Just proves money can't buy you a good team but young talent and ambition will
Lampard out
Said it last time and I'll say it again we are going to struggle against every team in the premiere league this season.
3 mistakes and southhampton score 3 goals. Credit to them for not wasting thier chances.
If you just get another sponshership maybe you’ll start winning games
Frank started Kepa again😂😂😂
Well deserved point!
What does sky sports gain from not showing the score and minute in the top left corner 🤦🏼‍♂️
Almost a theo Walcott debut goal
Please mendy get better soon  We need you
Can someone get hold of danny ings agent Ash him wtf that man is taking, man's on fire the last 12 months.
I hope Chelsea extend kepas contract 😂👏🏾
No doubt, we have a good attacking team, and quality players in the trio of Warner, Haivert, Pulisic,and Hakim.  But the unfortunate side of it is that we  are being coach by a PE teacher.  Until Chelsea FC management get us experienced and tactically matured football coach,  Chelsea FC will not win anything meaningful this season.  Liability Frank Lampard will  still continues to make selections on sentiments, without emphasising on merits.  His favourites players must play ahead of quality players,  and whilst others will either benched or outwrighly will not feature.  His experience cannot coach team above championship team level. The earlier, management does something the better, because those useless pundits and  timid fans will  only be shouting legend and no criticism of any kind.
Kepa has to go
John Abraham be like good result for Chelsea when he lost 6-1 to spurs😂
Is kepa sacred of the ball or something
Now Frank, there's new thing, it's called defending.  Yeah, well it's like attacking but the opposite, you see?
watch hammers thump spurs tommorow 3 nil, strange premier this season
Id rather have my grandad in goal than kepa, and he’s dead
Chelsea will never win anything under frank Lampard. He isn’t a good manager at all. We can’t win the premier league or challenge for big title with a leaky defence. Even with silva in we’ll still concede goals. The problem is the way Lampard has the team set up. He doesn’t really care about defending.
Lampard is trash
Kepa to blame again! Why tf is he still allowed to wear the shirt ffs! Lampard needs to get a grip!
Kepa is the biggest clown ever
Chelsea's defence was totally out of sync, if i didn't know any better it seems the defender want Kepa to be the fall guy...  Chelsea's defender especially Zouma and Christensen lacks creativity going forward... I missed the days of Terry and Carvalho. Let's admit it Lampard is not defensive minded, it seem he's out of his depth.
If Zoums had made more effort to get back after that hospital pass, he may have stopped them scoring, he just stopped. That said, can Kepa get through a game without making a mistake that leads to a goal? 🤦‍♀️
kepa is pure comedy
You’ll never catch me
Nobody gonna talk about werner handball for second goal no? 🤧😂
Southampton’s 2nd goal 🤣 how is kepa that bad
good game by the nation of Peru
Kepa could be the worst keeper this season
As a Chelsea fan these defensive performances really hurt
Kepa is the worst manager that chelsea ever had
He is completely useless.
he just can never kepacleansheet
Why tf does lamps still play kepa the donkey
KH is trash
With the Kepa's mistake, you can't really blame him on this one, Zouma passed it to a bloody forward in the box!
Lol
Chelsea wars: Kepa strikes back
He decides to start scoring after i take him out of my fpl team
Kepa at over £70M? Wow...
Werner 2, havertz 1, kepa 3
That keeper is shite
Kepa fucked up like 3 times for that goal
I can't believe this i'm watching this video minding my own business when it gets to 2-2 i realised Kepa was in goal, why would you pay all that money and end up putting him back in goal play the third keeper.  that made my day
My team 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
As a Chelsea supporter WTF is Kepa doing ????🤬
Up the Saints
Kepa is always making mistakes
i used to be a subsutitute keeper in primary in case the keeper was in trouble and ill do a better job in yr2
Actually cry myself to sleep because of kepa
Chelsea are the most expensive apron: Lovely to look at in the front, Nothing in the back
happy for Southampton tbh
Well done to Southampton but as a Chelsea fan we should have won this game comfortably but we were punished for not defending well enough
And then we thought kepa couldn't get worse than the Liverpool game
Champions League attack, under 5s defending
Did anyone actually pay the £15.95??
Wheres mendy
Before the start of the game: I wonder if Kepa will do something ridiculous.  After the game: oh good
That Chelsea GK is bloody awful !
Werner’s first goal and Southampton’s second were straight out of Fifa
Looks like kepa became a ghost when Che Adams put it past him
LISTERINE PEPPERMINT KILLS COVID-19 INSTANTLY SPREAD THE MESSAGE IF U WANT TO HELP OUT
Lampard was a player legend but that's no reason he should make a great manager.
The move from werner was sick
Kepa man
Kepa is dreadful
Joke ting defence was shambles conceded 9 goals in 5 games kepa actually played good so shout out to him
Kepa would literally end up being on the bench for my Sunday league team
How much longer are they going to tolerate these poor results from a potent attack. The answers lie directly at the managers feet and I can’t see him being in charge for much longer.
KEPA AGAIN
Kepa can let 20 goals a game in and he still won't decide to drop himself.
Southampton till I die 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Waiting for rantman
How is Kepa still in the first XI 🤣
Why always Southampton at the end obafemi did it United and I hate the fat bastard no this
The Three-o Walcott millions
Kepa having a Kepa
Great persistence by Adams for his goal.
Hey Sky you don’t talk enough about Man U !
Werner was excellent but all for nothing in the end cause our constant stupid comical defending letting us down 🤦‍♂️
Seriously how incompetent can you be how has kepa let that in
kepa pls go away
Yeah lamps is gone soon
I took Werner and havertz out of my team last week. And I’m a Chelsea fan. I’m buzzing they scored but at the same time extremely sad it took them out.
Absolute genius play from KAI HAVERTZ to set up Danny Ings for his goal
Yh Frank Lampard bitting his nail I bet there’s poo inside his nail
Kepa is awful absolutely awful
Really feel for my brothers I’m blue they deserved to win, time to invest in some new defenders. Rangers 🤜🤛 Chelsea
Lampard on the ropes
kepas playing well again then
I have no faith in kepa whatsoever. Flimsy keeper.
Chelsea are fooking hopeless....
Yesssss. Let’s go! COYS
Kepa is worse than...
That 2nd Southampton goal was Chelsea's defence in a nutshell
Is it just me or wasn’t havertz fouled for the first goal??
Won’t be surprised if Specsavers target an advert at Kepa soon...
kepa=trash
I kept werner havertz and chill well in my fantasy
Yeah... the 2nd goal was "all about the assist"
Coyr 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
I acc fell sorry for kepa atp
Now that's the Kepa we all know and love
I thought Southampton new signing Kepa Played well.
0:37 big swingy loopy pass
kepa thinks its bloody fifa
Kepa is a disgrace
Do you remember that character Doofy from Scary Movie?
Chelsea can only score 3
It's kinda funny that a 6 foot 6 Vestergaard had to duck for the header
250 million for a draw?😂 if that was anyone else they would get trolled...
Going forward absolutely good, at the back calamity as usual!! Need Silva back asap
Angry rantman will be good tonight 🤣
If we’re going to keep playing kepa we might aswell just put a chair in goal
Kepa out!!! What have I witnessed for that second goal
Idc what anyone says we still haven’t got our best starting line up on so... 🤷‍♂️
Kepa loool
Enjoy your evening Fat Frank.
Southampton did well to claw back a point 👏
Keeps need to go lmao
Theo! Theo! Theo! 😍
Wow as soon as I take him out from my FPL team 🙄
I really stick by my opinion in saying that Christiansen is not cut out to be a regular centre back for Chelsea, he lacks everything we need to compliment Zouma which is communication, leadership at the back and damn right knowledge of positional defending as a centre back. Playing Werner where he belongs was not rocket science it proves that today 2 goals and an assist. I can't wait for Mendy and Thiago silva to return
Only Chelsea can spend over 200m and still not get three points against Southampton
Kepa is the worlds greatest fraud 👏🏼👏🏼
Kepa is actually dreadful
Lampard will still play Kepa in the next game :P
COYR!!!!
Why does Kepa first go in with his knees and then his feet? Someone tell him he’s allowed to use his hands
Out here waiting for John Abraham and Uncle ruckus to slag chelsea off once again😂😂
Kepa out
Lads I swear Hassenhuttl is such an underrated manager
Kepa couldn’t save a word document
People really thought Chelsea would contend for the title with a defence like that 😂. Attack is good, defence and keeper no
Timoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Must give credit to Southampton, they were brilliant and great to see Theo Walcott playing well on his debut
What a banter club try so hard to buy success
Zouma is a joke
theo walcott is still playing damn
Kepa needs to go ASAP what a waste of money he was!
Shout out to myself for sticking with Werner in FPL.
The assait by Jorginho ⚡
You notice how their wasn’t one save from Kepa In these highlights
These ‘most expensive’ players are really paying off 😍 shoutout Maguire and kepa
I wish they gave Walcott the goal
Imagine Chelsea fans had the audacity to slag man United about Maguire even do their defense needs surgery  F*ck 220 mil on mid and Attack  And their defense Shocking 😂😂
Chelsea are bottle jobs. 200 million down the drain and Chelsea will bottle it again
Sack lampard who pisses me off by losing or drawing against middle and bottom team and get allegri in as our manager
*Zouma may have the best leap in the prem with DCL*
HAHAHAHAHAHA LETS ALL LAUGH AT CHELSEA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*Lol we may have drawn but where are the Werner doubters now*
Blame kepa 🥴🔵💙
Once Werner and Havertz come good Chelsea will be unstoppable they said......
Alternative title :   kepa strikes again with a vital mistake to give  southamton a point
why is Frank lampard letting kepa play
Why do we have international football  Thiago silva and mendy were needed at the back today  Rudiger zouma and christensen will not win us any trophies at the back  Positives were the goals werner and havertz got  Ziyech showed some glimpse of his flair  Pulisic will need some time to get his spark back  Lampard can't be blamed for player mistakes but he needs to make subs quicker  Kovacic and CHO should have come on around 60 min
Chelsea need to sign Harry Maguire at any cost to sort their defending issues.
*Kepa* *Thats it, thats the comment*
Anyone else waiting for Rantman's take on Kepa's performance?
Moment of silence for everyone who transferred Werner out of their fantasy teams
*Stevie Wonder would be more useful in goal than Kepa*
Kepa hahahahahaha
200 million spent mostly on our attacking options and defensively we're just as shite as last season. How can we begin to challenge if we're unable to close out winnable games like this? Pathetic
Chelsea really living up to that 3 mobile sponsorship loool
Now that’s the Werner we all know and love.
Chelsea spent £243.3 million to drop points against West Brom and Southampton
We waited too long for this
The Premier League is looking to be crazy this season
Kepa.... That’s it  I think it’s at that state now
chelsea defence is not good enough
So Chelsea start playing their new signings in their natural positions, and incredibly they start scoring. Revolutionary. Werner has looked totally lost playing out on the left wing
72million pound goalkeeper...
Why did they take so long for the video ?
Looks like Chelsea has agreed whenever they do anything with 3 they get more money
Chelsea are taking the Three sponsorship a bit TOO seriously.
Werner is coming into his own
Chelsea need to change their sponsors
Fair play to Chelsea, playing a full game with their manager in goal.
3 goals and 1 point. Werner & Havertz was outstanding.  Cant wait to see Pulisic and Ziyech start on the wings. Chillwell already improving at left back. We missed Mendy Kovacic & Silva today. Let the former europa league winners beat the current holders next up
first
Let’s be honest, who else took out Werner of there fantasy before this
Fat Frank on his phone to the Russian after this. Small club, spent 200M and can’t beat Southampton or West Brom....
Don’t you just love seeing Kepa conceding 3 stupid goals.
Saints🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
I’m getting tired of this Chelsea team
Glad Southampton got a point they thoroughly deserved it showed a lot of steel and determination here from a blade
moment of silence to the people who put werner *out* there FPL this week...
kepa hahahahahah
I had to miss this cause now we have to pay £15 to watcher certain matches 🤬
Second because god is first
Christ
The 3 curse strikes again
Last time I was this early, Kepa still had potential
Took long enough
Werner finally scoring
Everton to win the league 🔵
Saints are doing well recently
Another brilliant kepa performance
