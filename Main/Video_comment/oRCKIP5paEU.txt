The real issue here is that it doesn't look or sound like a Christie adaptation. It's hysterical and overwrought, and the camera is all over the place. I thought it was a muddled mess and I guessed who the guilty party by reading the cast list.
I need a Bauta. 🤔
Love to see more!😊
good
I love agatha christie's character of detective Poirot. He is a very smart detective.  I also saw beautiful scenery of venice...hope to make it there one day in the future!  I watched on amazon prime.
Amazing movie ! worth watching . Love hercule poirot movies !
Afraid it’s a scary Asian movie from 20th century Columbia.
Gore log Kali movie, ankhe bhi bol rahi hain kya dikha raha hai,,😂🤣😂🤣
How much Venice does this film actually show?
Cheap and effete. Tawdry and woke. Disconnected. Unappealing. Predictably broke. 👎👎
Movie was terrible
Kelly Reilly one amazing actress, the best
Some parts of the film are completely falsified. halloween was never celebrated in Italy before 2005. Some parts of the film are completely falsified. Halloween was never celebrated in Italy before 2005 and especially in Venice, where the carnival is much more important. Who writes the screenplays?
Just saw this movie (I already saw the previous two as well). As both a mystery and horror fan I loved it, definitely a better horror movie than most out nowadays, despite this not being a real horror movie. It's a shame that it basically changed almost everything from the book, but it still was a very good story.
I enjoyed this murder mystery! The lighting in this film was subpar. It's a good healthy story, though.  *21st November 2023*
Poirot bases his doubt for God on the fact that evil happens,  but that is us doing the evil, not God, He merely allows it.   Why does He allow it?    First of all, free will,    He can stop a bad outcome someone intends if that is what is best,  but He will not force a sinner to stop their evil actions.      Secondly,   are not also you and i a part of the evil and sin in the world?  If you want God to stop or destroy evil why not just start with you or me?  He gives us chances, He calls us, He puts opportunities and graces and miracles as well as misfortunes before us to turn us back to Him.  Don't you also want to be given chances?                  Thirdly,  He only permits evil because He can bring great good out of it,   think of the many examples in your life and in others', or examples in movies,  where if something sad or bad had not been permitted to happen then somebody's life would've never changed or something else terrible would've happened.     God knows what is best for us,  and often suffering changes us into better people;  we each have a cross to bear,  it's our choice whether we're going to accept it or not.  Has Poirot not also seen many miracles and heard of many unexplainable things in His travels?   He's gone to so many places, i've been barely anywhere and yet i know of more miracles to prove God's existence than He appears to.      With all his intelligence Hercule assumes that this universe came from nothing?   That is scientifically impossible,  it came from something,   and only a Person with a mind, with, love with benevolence, could've created our souls and minds and the beauty we see around us.   We seek purpose, we look for meaning,  we are a result of intelligent design,  these things don't happen by accident

Was that micheal from peaky blinders?
I love Agatha Christie's books, I also love David Suchet as Poirot. Sadly it's not him in this movie, I'm disappointed.
very very bad movie😢I am wasting my time🙄
Kaand kro uske bd jhelo 😂
When is Hastings going to be introduced and is there ever going to be a spin-off series about Ms. Marple?
I’m going to watch this with my class💀💀
بليز، أين الفيلم كامل؟
Is that same toy used in conjuring 2
I already watch it do you?
Cheese
It was okay for me. I love horror and murder mystery so it was fun to watch. I really liked the ending
Hey Ken, don’t ruin this one too.
Excellent film
Worst ever. Don’t waste your time
Big hercule ready to mash things up
😮😮😮😮 q filme
Yawn
I heard that this was going to be one of the BEST!  Can hardly wait!  I love who-done-its!
I really hope we get more of Hercule poirot movies
horror?
Great movie. There was no butler and the plot thickens.  😎  Thanks for a Hallowe'en Party movie.
I hated this trailer. Hope the film is actually good
yep   im watching this in a few more days though im reading this movie's reviews 1st
10 out of a 10. Amazing script, acting and music score from Hildur. 🎉
watchin it this Thursday in the theaters
Is that also Beth from Yellowstone?
Seeing for the first time my city in a Hollywood movie it gives me tears of emotion. All the world is beautiful. But seeing Venice is unbelievable and wonderful.... 😮😮😮❤️❤️❤️
cant wait
There's nothing scarier than Tina Fey in a horror movie.
I am reading Christie’s ‘Halloween Party’ the book that, supposedly, this movie is based on.   From the trailer the book and the movie aren’t even close to each other … at all!!!
Are there any hidden ghost/demons?
a movie for adults! finally.
oh dear, mr branagh ruins another agatha c movie....
Maybe it’s a great thriller, but Dame Agatha Christie should be left alone.  Like putting too much tacky gold ornament in the setting of a magnificent gem. The gem is ruined.
All the great Agatha books to chose from they pick this? A little disappointed. There’s at least twenty better books to turn into movies.
I'm watching.😊
Eh!
That long hair in front of girl look is pretty iconic huh
I can't wait to see 😍 this movie it looks great 😍 🙌 💕 💖 💗 ☺
Hindi dubbed update please
TINA FEY?!?  Yassssss
You can tell by the lack of star power the budget has taken a hit.
It's rumored that The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the next Agatha Christie novel that going to be by Kenneth Branagh!!🙀🙀🙀
Kenneth Branaugh was the wrong choice to play Hurcule Poirot.
This movie looks really good. I’m excited for this one! Love the cast it’ll be awesome to see them all together in this.
I’m bummed, I love mystery movies, but not horror ones. I’ve seen the other ones in this series and was excited about one set in beautiful Venice, but I don’t think I’ll be watching this one
Italy is always the best place where realize a movie❤
This looks cool and spooky. Can't wait for this.
Poirot moving mad
Why does everyone keep saying that this is based on Halloween Party? I see nothing from that book in this trailer. Nothing. Everything in the trailer seems like it's from a brand new story.
Great movie❤
Not scare me at all.
Wow, really looking forward to it!
I am here cause of tash
looks stupid.  Tina Fey should not be in a film with Kenneth branaugh
ITS THE BIRD
Is Tina Fey supposed to be Ariadne Oliver? I'll watch it but this looks nothing like the book
this direction is very interesting.
September is too long bruh😢
The first movie of ghost  Ghost vs detective  Wow
Michelle Yeoh yes queen
For Fall read Autumn!
Bit of a genre shift 🔥👏🏻
The reveal with the defective was pure gold
Looks like there getting Poirot Right Here.
Spoopy mistery
Omg! I got so excited when I realized it's a Poirot film! Yes, 💯 times yes!
A horror mystery based on a Poirot adventure?! I never knew I wanted something like this so badly!
I'm really looking forward to this movie. Hallowe'en Party is one my favourite stories of Agatha Christie. I have seen the David Suchet version of Hallowe'en Party and it's really good.
You had me at Jamie Dornan! Come on September 15th!!
I can tell the cinematography is going to be brilliant. Just like 'The Church' (Dario Argento, 1989), love that film, and how beautifully it's shot. Plus, the story is intense. So want to see this!
Another Poirot movie and an Agatha Christie's classic. I would watch this one. Also, I'm glad to see Action Icon Michelle Yeoh and Comedy Legend Tina Fey in a Thriller/Horror movie! This is so refreshing! ✨
wow cant wait to watch it, also looking forward to more and more agatha christie's adaptation movies
the incoherent screech i just let out I'm so excited
This trailer got me! Saw it for the first time at the theater and was so stoked when I saw Poirot show up! Had no idea what this movie was and now I’m dying to see it.
It's so interesting, I came to see the trailer cause the poster grabbed my attention, and was surprised to learn it was another Hercule Poirot film! Unexpected, very cool marketing, actually.
Gotta see this , especially for Jamie Dornan 😍💕
I'm honesty surprised that even when the first two films did not do so well the studios still continued to make more. Good on them for keep trying.
Keep these Christie adaptations coming please!
Sorry Mr. Poirot, you have been killed twice one by Christie and one by Hollywood
I was so suprised to see her in this trailer.
I'm reading the book this is "inspired" by, and I am SO confused. This still looks great, but it really isn't Hallowe'en Party. Still, I'm excited! 💀🍎🎃🇮🇹
oooh a little girl, how scary. get new ideas you fools.
لااطيق الانتضار 👏😍
We love the movies of Hercules Poirot, please, do more of these movies. Its pure gold.
No one can ever replace David Suchet but I really enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's last two Poirot adaptations so I'll be sure to watch this one when it comes out. I have read a few Agatha Christie novels (Miss Marple) and a collection of Poirot short stories but not this one, so I'll be going in without any expectations.Cast looks great, especially Michelle Yeoh. And Tina Fey is a welcome suprise (interesting for her to branch out of comedy). Can't wait!
Ew
More Poirot movies I’m in
Please 20th Century Studios, don't hire british filmmakers 😢
This is NOT Agatha Christie. The only thing that reminds of the book is  that annoying halloween thing. It doesn't even look like a mystery movie. Kenneth Branagh, give up. Just STOP. I feel like this is just some random horror that uses Poirot only to gain viewers. I'm SO dissapointed.
I lov Keneth Abraham as hercule poriot I’m hyped up! I’ll be at regal theater near upland y’all
Kenneth Branagh is the worst Poirot ever!
I am ercule puayo
Ooooo,  Count me in. Big Agatha Christie fan.
I love the cast
another movie flop
This looks dumb and boring
I would be excited if Branagh was actually a good Poirot, but unfortunately he is not
The other movies tried to stick more or less to the actual Agatha Christie novels. This one has nothing in common with the novel. Seances? Ghosts? Nothing remotely similar. When you have the vast, rich, almost unending treasure of the Agatha Christie books, why completely make up stuff? I dont get it. 🙅‍♀
This looks like a good movie.  Agatha Christie was the greatest mystery writer in history. She was only ever outsold by Shakespeare & The Bible.
sound better than the mexican shark curse movie..
Before watching the preview I'm commenting about it. I already know the cast is gonna be young and retarded. The new "scary" movies these days are Fucken garbage.
Agatha Christie was and still is in a league of her own, no one can get close to her story writing. This movie looks umissable and I can't wait to see it!
Love Kenneth in these films. I couldn't picture anyone else doing this.
Hollywood's answer to a bomb: let's make another and see if that one works!
Michelle Yeoh
This is too cute...
🥱Same old ghost tricks. Nothing new.
Yea this is going to be a pass for me smh
Lmao is this supposed to be scary
I found myself wishing the previous two Poirot films were darker. I hope this third entry is as dark as the trailer makes it to be.
Italy 🇮🇹
Love agatha christie!
Please 20th Century Studios, don't hire british filmmakers. Hire American filmmakers like Clint Eastwood. You haven't worked with legends like Stanley Kubrick 😢
That’s Tina Fey?!! 🤯
Why is this franchise slowly turns into Insidious?
not a good trailer
please stop using "venice" when referring to Venezia, I don't care that its the global standard, it takes place in Italy, so use the Italian word 🥰 /j (if you get this reference, you're amazing)
nope
It looks terrible
Gotta have the bathroom mirror jumpscare
It amazes me how people are so obsessed with summoning spirits and whatnot, they freak out when horrid things start happened to them🤨🙄.
I'm here for Kelly Reilly! <3
This looks absolutely garbage. Hard pass
not scary enough
I'm SO excited for this!!!
Too commercial…what is Tina Fey doing in it?
This time it's not a "whodunit" but a "WTF is going on"
Finally, a blockbuster horror movie. Ever since the conjuring all we've had is terrible
I love the faux posts from 20th century fox here's a suggestion maybe don't be so obvious
O_O Is this even horror? I was arroused when they showed the girl in the mirror lmao
I just love when you see a movie title and instantly know it's Agatha Christie.
Is is reaaaal
I want to be a ghost!
Plot same as Scooby Doo movie undoubtedly
David Suchet would like a word with Kenneth Branagh
I will be seated
EYEROLL AF
If he grew his mustache back that means he got rejected by that block woman she was hitting on after the last movie
Argh! This is gonna be a scream
Yah ...jenis film baru ...buat michelle yeoh.....malaysian pride ...
*OH ITS THE GUY FROM, OH GOD, I FORGET HIS NAME, BUT HE'S THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE!! AHHH I'M EXCITED, HEHHHEEE*
MFen Beth Dutton
If the director gets a better concept, day light ghosts are more scarier dark hairy ghosts
Love it !
Idk why this is making me laugh tho
Hyped
One word for this movie..                     Lol........
Wait Poirot?? I’m pleasantly confused haha looking forward to this 🤌🏼
Looks like a bit of Poirotnormal Activity goin on.
Yes! Loved the first two 👏
i swear this lady is in every movie now haha
Well I had no idea this would be a murder mystery until the very end
Oh god Hercule!
Horror movies are back
Michelle❤
after David Suchet played Poirot the mold was broken no one will ever play the part better you could close your eyes while reading an A.C. book and picture Hercule  and in my minds eye he was exactly as Suchet played him he was perfect at the part the mannerisms the accent the total package Branagh does not even come close imho
Nowadays 95% English/Hindi Movies are on Black Magic 🤮🤮🤮. Nothing Natural like back in the Days 👎🏻👎🏻
Murder on the oriented express from this movie im fan of Hercules poirot and books of agatha christies.... Need more it
they just don't make very good movies anymore
Ansiosa para assistir
It seems to be an interesting story. Poirot meets ghost. Although it is not really a horror movie, it still has supernatural elements. I guess it is quite worth seeing.
I honestly thought that "The ABC Murders" was next.  But this looks great!
This film series is getting better and better. So hype for this one. 😊
Spider was there dude ask him for help
so many horror movies coming out this year. i hope they all live up to the hype
I thought this is a part of Haunting series, then my man Poirot came over! 😂🎉
The moustache is back, baby. Hyped!
The exposition is trash.
It's smells like a lawsuit coming from Venice
Skip the summer movies - I’m ready for fall
looks terrible
SO EXCITED FOR MORE AGATHA CHRISTIE
I love traukers
Ok,i watched the David Suchet and Afraid Molina versions of hercule poirot but Kenneth Branargh version is cool and cant wait for this Film....
Yess yess yessssss
The cast and the horror elements is gonna elevate this to one of the most talked about films!
The european backdrop makes it boring.
One more 4.5 rating horror movie .
As long as this isn’t full of obvious CGI and Green Screen like the last one was (which took me out of the movie IMO) I’m in.
Seeing the title I thought it was a Poirot film. Seeing hal of the trailer made me think it was not. Then he fcking showed.
THANK YOU! One of those rare cases where they DO NOT SHOW THE WHOLE MOVIE in the trailer! This is how the movie trailers must be made!
Too much screaming.
Poirot on the case again, this time hunting ghosts and chasing shadows. Looks interesting.
A Haunting in Venice Genre: Supernatural Horror Mystery Thriller Crime
Detective Hercule Poirot Has Dealt With A Few Cases Kidnapper Cassetti Femme Fatale Jacqueline And Now A Ghost or a Spirit
Same ole mind bending bullshit coming out of the global entities bought and paid for media machine HOLLYWOOD. When are people going to stop watching this complete non stop repetitive garbage. The world is out of its mind
Yasss! More Poirot films, puhlease!!!!
Did not know I needed Michelle Yeoh in a horror movie but here I am.
Now this has piqued my interest!!!!! ❤️
Even the trailer is boring.......😑
You know a movie is trash when they rely on sudden volume increase for a "Jump scare".
Wow im in it
Agatha's amaze
I dont understand why did they change the storyline and use the same character's names😮‍💨😔
not a horror movie but suspense and mystery.
This trailer put me to sleep. Also, Tina Fey? Really?
What is it with these horror movies. Ngl the trailer looks good but movie directors realized people favor the horror genre more than anything else
oooo im exited
Time for me to read an Agatha Christie book 😍😍
Hm Me
Oh the trailer is over... i was waiting for the scary scene! anyway... i like the part when the ghost makes people throw bowels insideout
um, no.
I love how they play this like a horror movie. Might give a different feel to the Poirot series.
WTF is the casting for this movie? Absolutely ridiculously stupid lol
COOL!!!
I thought he shaved his moustache in the last film
Toos❤
Seriously! SEPTEMBER!!??!!
I hate scary movies will not watch them, but I love Kenneth Branagh as hercule poirot so much I will watch this 1!
The moment when Kenneth Branagh showed up was hilarious. Like it already looked awful, then he comes in and it’s so off and weird. God dam. Can he make it 3 boring af movies from 3?
Looks a bit tom tit to me.
Hey a girl with messy hair hanging in front of her face all of a sudden standing behind you when you look in the mirror - never seen that before in movies so this must be a good one.
Now,that was unexpected
An other conjouring movie
yea no
This looks nothing like the book…
Great cast!!  Can’t wait to see this.
ON MY BDAY? F YEA
Why is Hollywood so desperate to make Michelle Yeoh happen? It's not gonna happen. She was good when she was eye candy in a James Bond film but that's it. She is a terrible woke garbage actor.
Well constructed trailer.  Not woke.  Love it.
Why are there no Italian people in this?
The trailer sold it for me. It didn’t give too much away, the cast is fantastic and it looks pretty spooky. Cannot wait.
Michelle yoeh in that age multitasking gonna be 🔥
Looks like every other typical horror movie🤷🏻‍♂️
i don't get it. this barely feels like the story i had read.
well, time call in the Inquisition "NO ONE CAN HIDE FROM THE HOLY INQUISITION!! NOT EVEN GHOSTS AND DEMONS!!!!"
Looks terrible.
well that was a surprise. it turned into a detective movie in the last 10 seconds of the trailer lol
Is some woman with wet hair. She doesn’t even look scary or looks like a ghost. It looks like she just came out from the shower
0:18 that shot actually looks really dope to be honest.
Was NOT ready for Hurcule Poirot to randomly show up in this hahaha I see now that it's an adaption, very clever hiding that
Oh my god i didn't know it's a poirot movie. I'm already excited seeing michelle yeoh and now i know this is poirot movie i can't wait.
i need to watch this
Me craving for quality murder mystery films: 🙂  This: 😍
The cinematography is beautiful, much better than in the second film.   I wonder if the film is going to pull a Scooby Doo on us with all the supernatural stuff.
Omg they got the Detective in this movie, does he still have the scar ?
Poirot is back! Nice!! These films has been good so far, I’ve enjoyed each one and I hope they keep coming. Agatha Christie has some great books to adapt
So they are rebooting the series  Hercule Poirot died in the last movie or the last episode of the TV series on his bed I don't remember correctly if it was the movie or the series It has been few years since I watched it
Ohhh
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
Boo 👎🏾
Robert Ebert from VVitch?
Until 1:28 I thought it was a conjuring movie.
The haunting ... ?
Looks pretty bad lol
Michelle Yeoh is literally everywhere!!!!!!
If anyone wants to see an actual good Poirot watch the David Suchet version.
Don't pay for this trash...
and because asian lady won an oscar its time to see here everywhere , even if it doesnt fit , ty oscars
What a waste!
Bongu la undi...edi oka horror ah...thupuk
I fad zero per cent idea that it is a Hercule Poirot film. That's why it was a twist for me.
Michelle Yeoh? yes im in
I see nothing but flash Lightining only 😂
Michelle “Keep a Bag” Yeoh stay working 🙌🏽
The music is so similar to hannibal
Michelle Yeoh had so many projects
I hope that this movie may released in india
Enjoyed the last two so much, think I’ll take my madre to the cinema for this one
Me, when I saw the thumbnail: Oh! A new horror movie!  _Poirot pops up_  Me: Even better. It's a murder mystery. 😅
And he will wreck this one too. Never has Poirot used a gun and to do that, to me out me completely off!! Poirot had a moral and ethic code that Suchet played to the hilt beautifully, Branner shames the character in taking his own liberties. I loathe him as Poirot.
Dude ive been waiting for the sequel to last 2 movie. Finally im so hype now.
Is Poirot in a horror mystery? I'm all in for this!!!
Wow! Looks interesting 🤔
Worst character in film poirot played by this guy ....that's a no
Kanchana is better than this.
Не знал что Агата Кристи писала мистику
It's this agtha Christie book
My favorite city, my favorite author, and my favorite detective❤. I can’t wait!
hyped!
Man I saw it even u warn me . For god sake I got high fever on the 1st episode.  DON'T WATCH AN ANIME CALLED BOKU ⚠️
Kenneth Branagh's Poirot is starting to grow on me still doesn't top David Suchet and no one ever will, but his films are worth the watch. Looks better than some of the drivel thats out today tbh.
It reminds me of Dark Song
Wow what a phenomenal cast.  I love when movie magicians can make a city appear as it may have looked a hundred to two hundred years back, or so.  Though we are creatures of our time we have a huge proclivity to romanticize the past & extol only the good of those times while eschewing the bad elements.  Anyway, this looks amazing & has great potential.  Hopefully the substance of it is as good as its style.🙂👍
Call of Duty zombies
If you want more movies from Agatha Christie's books, dont wast chances with marvel movies.
Nothing about this movie seems scary or thrilling at all 🤷‍♂️… Where’s Ari Aster when you need him???
Hmm.  I'm a HUGE Christie/Poirot/Intelligent Ghost Story fan and a fan of this novel in particular.  This trailer looks great, however, there's NOTHING in it that even reminds me of the original story.  Why can't the producers/studio just say "We've written a new Poirot story" instead of just regurgitating character names from the book and employing no other elements whatsoever?  Not just this movie, but SO MANY movies and tv shows seems to abuse the ideas of original creators who can no longer around to protest or protect their work.  It's a cowardly and cynical practice.
The wide range of already written Poirot stories provides rich source material for these movies.  Glad they're doing more of them!! Great opportunity for ensemble casts.
That's a little different from the last two 🤣
Hercule Poirot is in horror suspense movie.? Let's see how Poirot deals it..  Expecting..
Is that Datuk Michelle Yeoh? Yep I'm gonna watch this. She's too awesome!
Thought it was a horror looking forward to this !
Definitely going to the cinema to watch it. 😁
Omg!! I was so excited to see Michelle Yeoh but then I screamed when I saw Kenneth Branagh.  A Hercule Poirot Ghost story!! Yes!!
This bears no resemblance to Christie's novel ' Hallowe'en Party' which it's supposedly based. 🤔
This is stupid.
Let’s hope it’s less enough champagne to fill the Nile and more spooky spook
experiencing the novel again is wonderful. Hope they turn other novels as well
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!!
Reminds me of Luigi Mansion
The Hercule reveal twist was good, and what the bet it's something in the water
i was not at all on board with this till I saw this was another poirot film- NOW IM COMPLETELY HYPED TO SEE IT!!!
I’m all for murder mystery’s movies and series let’s go bring some more  !!!!!!!
Omfg I was like "wait a minute isn't that...Poirot??? Wait a seconnddd and I checked the description to find out that IT IS ACTUALLY HIM!! SO EXCITED WTF!!!
This is obviously a mad movie. Very sad.
Can't waitttttttt 💞🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👀👀👀
Looks kinda mid
Welp I was out until I saw Poirot. Now we definitely in it.
The Sound design is just mindblowing...
Any recommendation for similar kind of movies?
Looks boring. I would not go watch something that primitive. If the movie is interesting then the trailer did a poor job showing it.
great
I’m so ready for this
Donatella Versace💜
Another boring movie
This movie looks bonkers 😐
Superb trailer and I can't wait for it! Every book of Agatha Christie should be turned into a movie!
so excited 🥰✨🤭
As cliche as it gets. Jesus does is anyone original anymore?
Is this on netflix in south Africa or is it to be released still
at the start i was just like "this is just like any other hororr movies" but as soon as i found hercule poirot on the scene i knew this movie is based on agatha christie books,, and im so hyped immediately,, we need more agatha christie book turn into movies or series..
Is this on netflix in south Africa or is it to be released still
Hercule Poirot?! I did not see that coming
Michelle Yeoh is booked and busy
this looks amazing already
Reel State was here.
Looks nothing like the book, whatsoever =\
The "I will give anything I have" gave it away for me, and poirot appearance just confirms my hunch this is about fake spirit medium. I suspect they will actually add a twist to make it there is actual ghost involved  in the end.
I don't know how they will top the twist, that this is a Poirot film. But I'm definitely intrigued.
Broke out laughing when Poirot shows up. Greatest twist in cinema trailer history.
Hell yeah
0:19 Eyes wide shut reference
As long as this is cool and I'm actually hyped (plus I like Branagh), still one doesn't replace David Suchet like these films. (Although he had already done all the stories.) Maybe an animated Suchet Poirot would be great. But let's not get used to another Poirot than him - the last and the best one.
(insert beyonce meme here) POIROT???
Is that Beth Dutton?
mischelle yeaoh is in like all movies now
Horror movie? I’m in
Yes Tina Fey!!!
This looks awful.
The Poirot-Verse! I dig it 🤘
Can’t waittttt
GOOSEBUMPS WHEN HERCULE POIROT ENTRANCE Unexpected
the first 2 weren’t good how did they get enough money for a third
Oooo…nice 😅
This looks like it's going to being an adaptation in name only  - that name being Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver (seriously, Joyce Reardon being an adult? Olga Smirnoff being alive?? Not to mention the whole VENICE thing) but it looks like it'll be an interesting movie anyway. And I'll watch Branagh in just about anything. So I'll definitely be heading to the movies this september.
the amount of trailers i've seen starring michelle is hauting
WOOOOOOO I LOVE THESE MOVIES
tumben 20th Century ngebuat film genre horor
Watch anything with Kelly Reilly
More Poirot? Oh I am HERE for it!
I'm in.
A trailer not showing the entire movie? I’m so happy
Is this a Hercule poirot movie???
Is this similar to that The Haunting of Hill House and The Haunting of Bly Manor? If yes, where is ny mom Victoria Pendretti???
Kelly Reilly?? In a haunting movie? Yes please! All of my favorite elements. Halloween night, seance, hauntings, the era, the all-star cast. Looks magical! 🖤🎃🎆
I read hear books,this should be thriler,not horor.
Who else was surprised when Poirot showed his Moustached face again?
As a huge horror fan, i'm not impressed
Lol. I knew the title sounded familiar, so I assumed it was an adaptation of some kind. But seeing Poirot there, in the context of all  those supernatural hints, felt weird.
Michelle Yeow is literally in everything and i'm all for it... Star Trek and now horror... yayyyy
No one imagined this would be a Poirot movie😂
Thought this was just another horror movie, then Poirot turned up. Love it.
Eto ata ung kwnto2 sa exorcism. Not real pero oks na din png nood2
OMG OMG OMG
I don’t know about this one.
Looks the same as any other horror paranormal film as of the last 10-13 years
A love the movie series! Can’t wait for this one
EHHHHHHHHH
AIDS riddled
This dudes mustache is getting a lot of work lately
Movie somewhat like get out and heriditary
Is it horror genre or mystery 🤔
Wow 0:08
gonna watch just for michellew
I can’t wait, so bloody excited
I hope there is an unexpected plot twist like the first film. the second film is too easy to guess the killer
Holy shmolly, it’s Poirot!
Boot ki ma ki chut
Wow, this looks like garbage
girl with wet hair  Terrifying.
is it just me or are all these cinema empires really coming out with banger horrors? Lionsgate, a24, 20th century
They should have made a movie called a haunting in povelia
I love Agatha Christie
The  name of the hercule poirot novel it’s called Hallowe'en Party
LOL @ Olga Smirnoff
I'm really looking forward to this movie!
Michelle Yeoh be snatching roles left, right and center 👏🏽😌
Agatha Christie ❤
Wow 20th century fox is learning from the GREAT A24!!!!
That ghost was a real shawty
i cant fn wait for this! a horror Hecure Poirot??? … I never knew I needed something so bad
It just hit me that this adaptation refers to the _Hallowe’en Party_ case... which, I don't need to tell you, isn't set in Venice at all but in a small village in Devon. 😆 Well, as long as Brannagh does the rest of this great Poirot story justice, I'm all ears!
Does not seem to be following the book at all.
Looks dumb
Is this supposed to be like a Catholic Church or something? Kinda wanna see this even though I feel like I have no idea what’s going on in the trailer 😂😂
i really love the trailer i can't wait for this movie
This movie is based on the Agatha Christie novel Halloween Party
This looks so stupid
Is this the trilogy of murder series?!
I hate horror movies !
This is gonna be brilliant cant wit
A billion jump scares. Pass.
I was hoping for Evil under the Sun as the next Poirot but this looks hauntingly good as well
now thats what i call a twist"
Woow... Didn't see Hercule Poirot being in this! Michelle Yeoh! Tina Fey! Hell yeah!
Banda bhalia lagila trailer ta
I feel this would be "that movie" of this year...
One more Ouija type bullshit.  I wonder why they don’t come up with new intriguing ideas for horror genre.
Is this a sequel?
I love horror Thriller
not advisable to watch at night lmao
Great
Seriously why do asian chick in every Hollywood movies
My sister walked in my bedroom and scared me the other day. I called it "A Haunting in Oklahoma City"
The mold behind my toilet looks scarier than this teaser trailer.
I honestly thought it was the Warren world??? The artifact from the Warren movies is heavily featured in the trailer!!!
It will be interesting to see Tina Fey in a serious role.
No one can make good horror movie online bullshit
I hope the next one's based on "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" coz we haven't had a good adaptation of that yet, because it's gonna be difficult to pull something like that off and I would like to see how you guys do it.
Can you make another Peanuts movie? Let the Camp Bullies return.
Can you make another Alvin and the Chipmunks live action movie? Let it focus on the Chipettes.
Eagerly waiting to watch this movie:)
La 2, es decir, la de Muerte en el Nilo los villanos eran evidentes pero aquí en la 3 por el tráiler se ve que es de suspenso e policial. Este giro de película está mucho mejor❤❤
Sounds like  resident evil village story
This is nothing like The Halloween Party, what Chrisite is this supposed to come from?
I lived in Venice for 4 days in 2015, and it was one the best days in my life. This doesn't change it still!
Excited! I really hope it doesn't just boil down to hallucinogens though.
I think im just gonna check it because of Beth.😅
Oh wow another spooky ghost movie. Riveting.
Looks ABSOLUTELY CRINGE. Definitely not what Venice is like and the vibe doesn't fit it. Laughed out loud.
Another one in just 1 year ?? So fast.
Dayummm detective movie looks diff... and absolutely promising
Oh hey look it’s Beth
The gentleman in the Train?   Poirot is the real deal!
Hollywood needs to come to some other countries and do new ghost movie with different theme, unique storylines. Westerners dont believe into this so the ghost story usually rely on sound effects instead of creepy storyline.
Can’t wait 😱
Nobody speaks Italian. I’m out
Looks terrible 😢
Holy.. it's Hercules Poirot 😮😮
Interesting setting, but why do I feel like I have seen such a trailer hundreds of times?
I thought this was gonna be another typical horror movie. But then Hercule Poirot appears and I was like, "WAIT WHAT?!!"
Tina Fey in a horror / suspense? Maybe Amy Poehler is playing the ghost.
mmmmeh
So corny
OH MY DAYS FROM A COMEDY TO MYSTERY TO HORROR
do any one know the novel name?
Everyone has tears in their eyes
This better be good coz the last one was very disappointing. Nevertheless, I still have high hopes for Hercule Poirot movies with Kenneth Branagh in them.
Is 1:39 supposed to be a scary jumpscare? Just the build up from 1:33 to that was wasted 😬 i don't know about this story tho so.
Pairot is back.....!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
I had no idea this was an Agatha Christie book, so I thought this was just another horror movie. Imagine my surprise when Hercule Poirot came out of nowhere
I dont know . I have not been a big fan of the last Poirot with this actor . Is not the actor is the way the movie was made .
As a paranormal/supernatural freak, THIS was my favourite book. Occult(?) Crime. Nothing can surpass this genre.
be careful who you call 👻
Great news movie lovers. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father(GOD) except thru me (JESUS). John 14:6 Jesus died for your sin believe and repent today.
Since when did a detective thriller became a supernatural horror? I’m confused as much as I’m interested.
Daaaaaang Michelle. I feel like I’ve seen hella trailers with her in the casting haha ❤️❤️❤️
Zzzzz
Are we gonna address the tonal shift here? I’m all here for it
duno why i thought the thumbnail is hogwarts.
Please release in the United States in 3D.  The other movies released in 3D internationally.
make me remember of the Thai movie , Reside..
This looks like a fun time. An adult Scooby Do, in the best sense.
the ghost looks too cute to be scary
Can you make another live action movie of Alvin and the chipmunks?
Can you make The Peanuts Movie 2?
Better watch out everyone, this demon can open windows 😂
Didn't know they were doing another Poirot film. Thought this was a trailer for a random horror film. Then it got to the end and of the trailer and my mind was blown! Can't wait for this!
Ooh! This looks interesting!
I'm so excited!
I'm intrigued by the change in genres for a Poirot movie.
I live for those words: "only in theaters" because there are days where I'm really tired of movies airing on streaming platforms
Hear before soul departs n not after.
I am huge Agatha Christie’s fan please please make more movies based on her books!!!
kenneth branagh squad rise up
The versatility of the cast looks super promising.
Sorry, these new Poirot remakes are not great.
waiting for trailer
I like horror feeling
Oh My God!!!!
🥱 that trailer was way too generic imho. Hope the movie succeeds tho
Yesss! Give me more Victorian and Edwardian haunting movies .
0:23 is that Jamie Dornan?
Is it a Hercule Poirot story?
The most haunting thing in Venice are cruise ships.
Poirot 🙌🙌
Rituals like this... is where you open up a door, that you don't want to, and you are suprised if later on, you or the ones who were their with you needs an exorcist.  Win stupid games, win satanic prises! Yes I know it is the next chapter in the series! -It's only a movieeeee! Still I wouldn't go to any kind of ritual like this! Almost all of them are fake...and costs money. But the ones you should avoid were it is not fake.
Yes! The third movie of my favorite detective!
Looks promising.
WTF is this? Kenneth Branagh needs to keep his filthy Hollywood paws off of Poirot. If he wanted to make a horror movie taking place in Venice, he should have done just that instead of bastardizing Agatha Christie.
Wait, Liz Lemon?
Wow. Kenneth Branagh actually making an original movie rather than his endless list of pointless remakes.
3 mil views with only 23k likes😢 must not be liked
This fall?🤣we didn’t even enter summer yet
The mustache detective is back XDDDDDD
Finally, why Italian movies don't make Venice look this good
Mr Hercule poirot himself
Michelle Yeoh & a taste of horror on Hercule Poirot. Another fun after Ghosted.
Bears absolutely no resemblance to the source material. Agatha would be turning in her grave.
OMG I DIDN'T KNOW THIS IS AN AGATHA CHRISTIE MOVIE UNTIL I SAW THE NAME HERCULE POIROT ON THE SCREEN OMG IM EXCITED!!! +++ Michelle Yeoh again!! <333
Sad that bouc wont be here anymore 😢
Michelle Yeoh is booked and busy. Love it!
We need more Agatha Christie books to be filmed - but unfortunately, nothing and no one can (in the foreseeable future) overcome great David Suchet.
Looks absolutely nothing like book it’s adapting. Hopefully this will be worth a watch but given Branagh’s track record with the other Poirot stories I’m not too hopeful
No
As a Christie fan, I can't help but feel like most of the comments are fake propaganda.  I do hope this one is better than the last.
A horror movie set in Italy! That sounds exciting 😍 as they are all set in USA haunted houses all the time 😅
Oops 🤫
It seems they got rid of Poirot's heavy accent. Good.
Is this an Hercule Poirot Horror movie!??
Was this trailer supposed to be spooky
loud sounds + jump scares = horror movie  gotta love it man
Oh, yes. I'm so here for the shift they are taking with this. I loved the previous 2, I'm exited.
Yes but *will there be enough wine* .... *to fill the Nile?*
Okay I am tripping because I didn't know Agatha Christie wrote a book with this title. But as I started watching this trailer I was thinking, 'oh hey are they gonna make a new Hercule Poirot movie, they should make The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and then Kenneth freaking Branagh showed up and I yelled, "HERCULE POIROT"!
Ghatiya trailor 🤮🤮 super flop
Oh dang, that's a marvellous cast!
Is that the same guy from the detective movie in a train? Like the same character?  I don't remember the name of the movie though
0:21 Is that supposed to be the same item as in the Conjuring 2? I don't think so, but it sure look alike except the skeletons. Also the one in the Conjuring 2 summoned the Crooked man if I remember it correctly, which by the way was terrible done in my opinion.
This one looks way more serious than the previous 2 films which had way lighter tones to them and I'm all for it! I hope Crooked House is done next, that's my favorite in the series of books
Michelle Yeoh?
Im geeked
I went "I know this voice" and all those 30 rock binges helped me figure out it was Tina fey 😀
Biggest twist was when I realised this is another Hercule Poirot film. When I saw Kenneth Branagh as Poirot I literally exclaimed "What?!?!"
https://youtu.be/oHQzAfTFik0
Who do you think killed her? https://youtu.be/oHQzAfTFik0
https://youtu.be/pG17ypWnqzo
You had me at... A Haunting.
Despite being a fan of Christie, and have read and watched plenty of the shorter Poirot stories, I somehow haven't read any of the stories they've made into the Branagh films. This one I'm interested to know if tonally it's anything like the book, as this seems much more on the horror side than the detective side I'm used to. I liked Orient Express & the Nile, but they aren't the greatest, hoping this one tightens things up a little.
This is giving me peeky blinders vibes.
yeah!
wow ghost communiy
Wish version Insidious
Looks good. Lets see if it can match David Suchet's Poirot
He officially made a trilogy of poirot films. Nice kenneth
Is this a spinoff too 13 GHOST?…this wicked
Agatha Christie, you legend!
wow michelle yeoh is very very busy now after everything, everywhere movie hehe 😀
Whoa the 3rd part is going for a serious tone. Love the horror vibe to it and absolutely did not see this coming. I'm very excited to see this!
Haha, smaller budget on actors than in last two episodes i see.
TINA FEY!!!!!!! Oh hell yeah 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:20 i thought i saw heath ledger
Finally a haunting film Without a freaking exocism
Wait how come i never heard of this until now 😮
Michelle is everywhere.. All at once..
Impossible crime and eerie séance? Got some real John Dickson Carr vibes here. Dig it.
An Hercule Poirot mystery as a horror movie? I'm digging it!!
Bro WTF, i DID NOT expect this to be the next Poirot Movie, noice 👌
Poirot! 🙌🙌🙌
Who's excited???
Wooooow yes yes yes, best news ever, the 3rd works from the best collection detective ever,1» murder in the orient express//2»Death on the neal
Wait was that hercule ?
Poirot???!!.. Bring it.. I'm in..
Mwah
Terrific cast
Ooooo, Michelle Yeoh, Kenneth Branagh, Tina Fey, in a Poirot horror murder mystery… chills guys, I’ve got chills.
The thriller is amazing. Solving a murder. A actuall ghost seeking justice. I just can’t wait.
Oh wow. Michelle yeoh 👀 so gonna watch this movie
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ LOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!
I thought it's a horror movie by seeing the thumbnail
Wow, another Hercule Poirot movie. Another Agatha Christie adaptation ❤❤❤
Yes, this looks interesting! Michelle Yeoh is everything :)
Where can i watch this?
Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh! She is showing a totally different side of her versatile acting here! I cant wait for this to come out
Just based off of this trailer...I'm obsessed with Tina Fey in this.
Can’t believe I was a part of it Greeting to all the Pinewood Studios team!!!!!
We need more of Agatha Christie's book turning into movies. This looks interesting!
Michelle Yeoh and Kelly Reilly?!?! I’m in.
Mr. poirot is backkkkkkkkkkkk.
Another example of rinse and repeat Hollywood.
This does not look interesting one bit. I feel I've seen this movie 50 times
Why are the top two posts the same thing almost word for word like it’s robotically written? 😅
This movie is a spinoff or something of the series a hautinf of hill house or what??
movie looks lame and not scary at all
These movies are guilty pleasures. Can't help but watch them
The previous 2 films were a snooze fest,  hopefully this one is good
Michelle Yeoh
Hercule is back! Wish there will be more sequels, two Is not enough.😅
Last one was mid. Hopefully this one’s a bit better
My guy poirot!!!
Looking forward to this
I'm dying for a cinematic franchise of Kenneth Branaugh films centered around on Detective Poirot. Keep them coming!!!
Hello nice movie can't wait to see it another thing is I'm curious is that the toy of The Conjuring that spins around and see Cartoon inside.
I didn’t like the first 2 films under Branagh due to the plodding scenes. I hope that this latest concept comes up with high expectations.
This teaser plays out like an intro to an Ace Attorney case.
I never thought I'd love a Poirot series.
This will definitely be one of the movies of all time.
Wow this looks good! Plus I love Michelle Yeoh - I have yet to see her award winning film ❤
Is this from conjuring universe?
He's back❤❤❤
Hercule Poirot count me in
Tina Fey NOT doing comedy? Whoa, you're blowing my mind here...
Very interested. Agatha Christie's books need to be made into movies!
WHAT EXACTLY DID MICHELLE YEOH DO TO SUDDENLY HAVE THE SPOTLIGHT BE ON HER AGAIN???!!!!😮
OMGGH yessshhh
After all it's a detective movie
A haunting in KONTOL™
Venice has now become a museum city. Unlivable from all points of view. I have no doubt that, as an enthusiast that I am, the film will be fantastic. However, I am afraid that it will contribute making this beautiful lagoon city a victim, even more than it already was, of tourism.
wowwww I can't wait to see it!!!
Came for the horror-looking premise, stayed for the mustache!
Ooh I'm excited for this! Loved the first 2 movies!
YA ALLAH AAAA EXCITED
That background score is so terrific.
Doesn’t look that good, I’m sorry.
Vizyon tarihini iple çekeceğim💜
This looks gooooood
His other two were alright, but hoping this one will be great!
That moustache got me
在哪里可以找到资源下载观看？
I think this movie looks good
holy crap, everything about this looks SOOOOO good!
shuuta Agatha Christie na nman! Count me in 😍
Where is hindi trailer
Cant wait to see this, looks really good.
Oh come on... How many times you are gonna show us same kind of ghost and themes... 😑 Bring something new that is scarier than a hell 👀
I absolutely love love Agathas book turned into films, this looks great, I love the cast - I am looking forward to it
Really well done trailer. Love that they let the set up play out before Hercule shows up
Hercule Poirot is back yesss 👍
Isn't that spinning toy similar to Insidious'?
Thank god he’s back ❤❤❤❤❤
1:43 it was so tense and dramatic up until the rupaul's drag race sound effect at the end
現在幾乎電影都有楊紫瓊耶😍😍😍
Love it! These movies are fun and such a nice break from the usual movies that come out
POIROT come back!!!
Agatha Christie books are so formulaic. You've read 1 you've read them.all
I don't know Agatha Christie write a horror book? Or this is a mystery film?
Agatha Christie? Say no more
I need more Hercule porior adventure more more more😊
A Haunting in Venice already looks splendid. We hope nothing but the best until this comes out.
I had no idea this was gonna be another Poirot film. Bloody hyped.
Kenneth Branagh is a great actor, detectives are exactly his element. I'll definitely be at the cinema
1:15 now there's a schnoz.
I hope isn’t as messy as the last poirot
Dayummm !!!
No diversity!!!!!!
Trash.
Terbaik Michelle Yeoh!
0:28 the crooked man
More Poirot... LET'S GO!!!
This looks good
Tina Fey was unexpected 😭
I prefer movies film in USA 🇺🇸 sorry  Or England that’s it
let's goo! another stupid "horror" movie!
Top 5 beat em up Games on Nintendo switch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J8Zyi0qi_4
Woohoo Beth!!
So many bots commenting. Looks interesting!
I’m calling it now it’s a flop
Was this shot on a Sony Venice?
Can't wait to see the detective gentlemen and also Michelle Yeoh!!
Let's go
didn't know this is a hercule poirot film.. what an amazing trailer it caught me off guard
Was intrigued but bored until Kenneth's mustache showed up. Am for certain all in now, though.
I was so shocked to see Poirot I thought this was a regular horror movie I had no idea it was an Agatha Christie 😂
POIROT IS BACK!!!!
Does not look very scary.
Hanuman chalisa Movie ends in 5 mins
The Murder of Roger Akroyd should be made next.
Disgusting AF. Travesty.
So this is based on Agatha Christie's 1969 novel *Hallowe'en Party* if I'm not mistaken..
tcs can you do live action brother bear cuz you're disney owned
Did not expect Hercule Poirot... Colour me intrigued.
The return of the Belgian super sleuth. This is Branagh's element. Whether it's Poirot, Shakespeare, or even Victor Frankenstein, he does his absolute best to give the audience his best performance. As the director, again, whether it's Christie, Shelley, Shakespeare, Lee, or a fairy tale, Branagh tells the story the best way he can.  On a different note, I'm not the biggest fan of Tina Fey as a comedian. When comedians write their own stuff, a good amount of the time it's terrible. Fey also tends to, in my view, try too hard to be funny. It doesn't matter if she wrote the stuff or not. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt here as the material is mystery drama. Maybe she can find a better outlet of performance outside of comedy.
Italy, the seat of the AC..........
probably none of you who is so excited for this upcoming movie has ever read an agatha Christie novel. In particular a Poirot novel. 🤦🏻‍♀️ this seem the trailer of "the conjuring". Someone please stop kenneth Branagh.
The is not Poirot. That's Scooby Doo with more facial hair.
LAME!
🍿
can you like my text? 😍🤩😘
YAY! Very excited for this movie!!
Looks boring
Sold just cuz it's Agatha Christie and Kenneth Branaugh but having Tina and Michelle is such a bonus!
WTF? Why is Michelle Yeoh in a spooky movie instead of action!?
more Michelle Yo!
I'm full of excitement for the new adaptation of the collection💀🗝🗡
But where’s the Ghost?
Yellowstone & Mayor of Kingstown meets Agatha Christie. ❤❤❤
This does not look great........
Tina Fey and Michelle Yeoh ? Consider me in
Yaaaaaaaaaaay
Looks like crap
This looks good!
I read the novel this was inspired by a few years back (Halloween Party). The one thing that stood out for me was the fact that, being written near the end of Poirot's career (late sixties), there was a LOT of "these kids today!" grumbling. Since this seems to be a much looser adaptation of its source, and since it seems to take place in the same time period as the other Branagh Poirot movies (mid-to-late thirties), that angle doesn't seem to be involved here. I look forward to seeing how this is going to turn out.
Hell yeah!
That almost comes across as horror....looks very intriguing. Seems like they've changed it quite a bit from the book. Can't wait to watch this
Branagh's first two Poirot films weren't great, just okay, maybe third time's the charm!
OK it looks interesting but I don't think it's gonna be scary at all
Yeah Agatha would be turning over in her grave right about now... This looks like a dumpster fire.
People really hyped about this?
Interesting thing I noticed When the spirits appeared The spinning wheel stopped on the Dancing Skeleton holding it's head  Eerie
Plot Twist: Ezio makes a cameo.
Dark fantasy for need for a move on the world of sport and how it
I thought this was a sequel to the haunting of Bly manor one until I saw Poirot
❤everything with Kenneth Branagh
Very nice horror, mystery and suspense thriller vibes!   Another innovative take on Poirot from Sir Kenneth Branagh is exactly what the doctor ordered.
Academy Awards winner Michelle Yeoh Academy Awards winner Kenneth Branagh in triller mystery film okay I'm in
Noooooo Branagh why would you shoot this one on digital????!!!!
AAARGH CANT WAIT
This looks decent. I don’t know about scary.
That was a HIT. Poirot AGainnn I love it.💯💯💯
the last movie two movies were about love and greed but this one is all horror and spooks 💀😨👏👏👏👍😅
Lame....
Trailer not scary. Same old bits with no bite and no fright!!
Wow, I thought this was another ghost movie until Kenneth Branagh's Poirot appeared! Excited.
😲 “ IDK…. Nowadays, movie previews usually show most films best scenes. Nevertheless, I like the old world look and narrative about it. ‘ Only time will tell ’ how  well or not It does, as far as with moviegoers. ”
And why is Ariadne Oliver an American? She is Agatha Christie herself and beautifully portrayed by Zoe Wanamaker in the Suchet versions. That's Madame Hooch to you HP fans.
Anyone who reads this will have less than 5 years left
Please someone tell Branaugh to stop making Poirot movies.  He has butchered the character.  Great actor but wrong for the part.
This looks great. Then again, I liked the previous two Kenneth Branagh Hercule Poirot movies
WHAT?! Beth Dutton is in the next Kenneth Branagh Poirot mystery movie?! SWEET!!
A horror whodunnit? That wasn’t on my bingo card.
Waste
https://youtu.be/nPfH93NbTpE
Lol....Not scary at all
Beautiful i love him
Après le multivers, vient l'horreur. J'adore "Michelle Yeoh" !
Imagine if instead of someone behind him, he looked in the mirror and his mustache was shaved off
Jesus, that was a quick turnover rate.
LoL! You’d think it’s a horror movie if you weren’t aware of Poirot
This cast is insane!! Can’t wait to see this!
😍. Mi incoriusisce il film
This cast is 🔥
Big plot twist: It isn't real.
Poirot was unexpected, but yes definitely watching it
one word: WHAT.THE.HELL?!? Sir Branagh, and all of your staff, I beg you: *please stop* . Stop adapting Agatha Christie's works.
جمييل
This is some weird casting
Who would go to Venice for Ouija!? 😂😂
We need both, Sherlock Holmes & Hercule Poirot
This year i have so much movies to watch and oh boy im watching this.
Mind Fckuing combination haunting + Orient..........🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Michelle Yeoh is shining bright right now
They're taking this series into the supernatural territory?! I'm really excited about this!
Tina fey in a horror mystery thriller?? Woah!!
omfg!!!!! i cant wait!
Clicked on this thinking it was a typical ghost horror movie, was pleasantly surprised to find it was another of the Branagh Poirot movies, and even more pleasantly surprised to find it had a supernatural twist. Had no idea this was coming. Looking forward to it.
Looks AWFUL. Not in keeping with Poirot.
Finally
When you get in there is no turnning back whether you like or not
A horror Agatha Christie movie? I'm interested.
Poirot 3 is coming. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMGGG WHAT a surprise at the end, I legit wasn't expecting to see Hercule Poirot here, absolutely looking forward to this one.
🥱
I was more than happy watching this trailer until I saw Hercule Poirot. I dont know why I cant stand Kenneth Branagh in that role. He is so not Hercule Poirot ! This character would never physically fight nor run and he did both in the last movie. Such a shame :(
The biggest jump scare was Poirot showing up in what I thought was the trailer for a horror film
Michelle Yeoh seems to be in everything, everywhere, and I love it!
I am shocked that this next one is more a horror film but I am here for it! Hopefully they get to promote this film, unlike the last one where there were barely any promos from the cast
We need more of Agatha Christie's books to be filmed. It looks interesting.
So many horror movies coming.
magnífica idea de poner a poirot en un misterio sobrenatural...❤❤
Murders happen wherever Hercule Poirot goes for holiday.
Mr Poirot is all we need now for new kinds of detective story.....📸📸📸
This looks so good.....but the last movie was so bad, I dunno how to feel abt this 😭
We need more movies like this , and movie based on Agatha Christie's books❤
📌Dyavol x - Aryankhan
am a simple man. I see Michelle Yeoh and I watch.
Extremely frightening for a Poirot film. That's a good turn from the two previous ones. Can't wait!
Not going to lie, before Kenneth Branagh's beautiful face was shown on screen, I had NO idea that this was another Agatha Christie novel adaptation.
New Scooby Doo movie looks great
Zajímavé👍
Is he Hercule Poirot 😃😍
you had me at michelle yeoh
Kenneth Branagh is back for his Detective Persona. Love it...
And Hercule Poirot is back! Michelle Yeoh and Tina Fey, I can't wait.
This looks way more dark and gritty than the last two movies (which I loved), I'm very here for it
Looks great!!!!
I'm so bored with jump scare horror movies.
I think this is gonna be better than the last one! Can't wait!!
KYLE ALLEN
Why are only girls haunted 🤔😂. Fact of the World...
kelly reilly and michelle yeoh in one movie???? COUNT ME IN !!!!!!!
I wanted to give up after the last movie, but setting a mystery in Venice will always drag me in.
Kenneth Branagh will always be my favorite childhood dinosaur narrator and film maker
Quite intriguing
AGATHA CHRISTIE!!!!!!
Very different (as Branagh's first two Christie movies have been - though this one even more so) and of course David Suchet and Peter Ustinov are always going to be hard to beat, but I'm still interested (sometimes I hate changes made, sometimes I don't mind, sometimes I'm curious to see just how much they've changed). Looking forward to it
Looks good, but it bugs me when a movie series changes its aspect ratio from film to film.
September!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Had to do a double take, that shot of the guy staring, kiiiiiinnnddaaa looked like heath ledger before brokeback mountain :(
Not all demons are ghosts but all ghosts are demons.
Flop movie
Michelle Yeoh in blonde? would love to see that. Also, Tina Fey in a thriller film? WOW
Looks cool
Yes .. Michelle Yeoh is in this movie...cant wait😂😂😂
YES! Agatha!
💞💞💞💞💞💞
I feel this is a combination of Halloween Party and the last seance
This movie looks awesome I will definitely be watching it when it comes out. 👍👏
wowww.. thought it is horror movie
Pls i need Miss. Marple and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd
Awesome
Wow❤we love her books 📖 to be adapted to movies
God Hollywood is on a horror spree this year 😂😂
Michelle Yeoh is in everything, everywhere all at once these days and am here for it!
interested....
Kenneth Branagh and Rian Johnson are fighting toe-to-toe.
Poirot
Are they trying to turn detective movie into horror? Many people will be terribly disappointed, thinking this is gonna be horror...
I'm excited to see Jamie dornan in such roles ❤🙌💯
Too gloomy, why do that? no mystery, no intrigue. It's like a trailer for a thrash horror. This is a detective film, make a normal trailer.
Wow...another Michelle Yeoh movie 🍿

I guess it came out everywhere all at once
The great detective is back ❤.
Is this movie surpose to be a horror?
Bien différent du Hercule Poirot que l'on connaît, mais un excellent acteur tout de même ;) Go Branagh Go
Hmmm
Michelle yeoh is in every movie that is coming out lol
Michelle Yeoh has been all over the scene nowadays, not that I am complaining.
Uh, it's wildly cool!!!!! I love it. Maybe I will buy a ticket for the show.  It's a new interpretation of the book. ❤️♥️
Is this kind a crime detective film?
Spoiler is not a ghost.
Such a thrilling trailer..
Love the idea to transform the original story into horror themed one with so much darker and more mysterious atmosphere! Can´t wait for return of Hercule Poirot!
That toy thing that keeeps spinning looks like the toy played by the kids in conjuring
Oh, dang, they did really well at burying the lead. I had no idea it was a Poirot movie until he showed up at the end. Still prefer David Suchet, though.
Michelle yeoh ? I am there like 100%!
I so this whole trailer and didn't realize u til the end that this was an agatha Christie novel lol until I saw Hercules poirout it looks so different than the usual adaptation
Jamie dornan so excited for his new work❤❤❤
it's shot like a comedy
This looks interesting. I've seen the tv movie version of Halloween Party on my local PBS channel.
Can't wait to see it.  Thank you, Mr. Branagh, for keeping this world of mystery going.
Let’s give other Asian female actors a chance please. Michelle Yeoh can’t be in everything.
excited....to watch this on big screen
i'll miss bouc
Another jump scares ghost story garbage 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kenneth Branagh gave me the jumpscare. Hercule Poirot is back 😍😍😍
i was legit shocked when I saw Poirot lol
The original name, i.e. "Halloween Party" should have been kept. I hate this change in title while adopting a famous author.
😳😳😲😲😨😱😱😱😍😍💖💖🥳🥳
Agatha Christie's adaptation rules
Hercule Poirot! Take my money NOW!
...Since when was the supernatural ever a part of the Poirot stories? I'm basing this off all the David Suchet adaptations that I've seen so far and none of them AFAIK showed that the paranormal does indeed exist.
Wow Michelle Yeoh is everything everywhere all at once these days lol Awesome
Is he also the same detective here?
Idk how I became a fan of this movie series but here I am excited for the 3rd movie
Michelle carried! How is Branagh doing jumpscares now
Photography is INSANE.
Nice he'll yeah good movie
SO EXCITED. PLEASE KEEP THIS SERIES GOING. SO GOOD. LOVED ALL THE MOVIES!!
🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
If only we got The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, its gonne be the greatest mystery ever🤩
Hercule Poirot is back ❤
Excite!
Usually I don't like and I won't watch for horror film. Except for this movie which is, I think, mixed of thriller+mystery+horror genres and based on Agatha Christie's novel, I'll do my best to restrain myself 🤦‍♀️👩
My Jamie
so Poirot is pulling a Conjuring now?   😒😒😒😒😒
Hey is this the continuation to the Murder on Orient express and Nile movies, for the detective at least.
Bruh Kenneth Branagh's Poirot series is so underrated. Looking forward to this!
So when you say "based on" Halloween Party...
Meh.
OK. THE YEAR OF HORROR
LETSGO MICHELLE YEOHHHHH
I’m super hyped
I really can't wait to see the movie
I’m surprised we are getting a 3rd film  the 2nd one did t do well
the fact tht i thought it was a horror movie and thought it was gonna be bleh, until I saw Hercule Poirot XD Love this man!
My concern is that ghost only come in nights. Why they dont come in sunlight? Anyone knows the reason behind it?
Did Michelle Yeoh also almost turn down this role because of her character's first name?
Must be learn of Al Quran..
This is an interesting take on Poirot. Thought this was a horror movie at first.
I'm loving the cast, the vibe. I'm ready for this now.
PART 3 ALREADY!!!
I think the movie looks a bit tame but the setting taking place in Venice interests me.
Kenneth Branagh as Detective Hercule Poirot .... on a super roll!
Michelle Yeoh is on fire. 🔥👏
Wow surprised by the actors, I thought this was a horror movie but why is the narrator is Tina Fey ? Hope the full movie is great.
No thank you
Nopeee it doesn't look good
Tf is Christian Grey doing here?
Yeoh from Yeoh to YEOH!
Oh wow okay I had no idea this was gonna be a part of one of Kenneth Branagh’s Agatha Christie movie adaptations. Looks shockingly suspenseful.
The 3rd film in this Poirot series is a straight up ghost horror film? Alright then.
Poirot and ghosts? 🤔
Which book is being adapted? Halloween's Party?    Edit: I just read the description, yes the movie is the adaptation of that book
It's "A Haunting In Venezia." not  "A Haunting In Venice."
I have to say, that clock at 0:52 is amazing! Whoever designed that deserves an Oscar!
Woaaahhhh whaaaaattt lets goopooooooo... i love this series so much
Wow , Hercule Poirot got me offguard in the end !! Looks interesting!
Ooooh….. he is back poirot. I loved how he showed last second 🥰
Hercule Poirot is back😂
Sorry to say but going to be flop
first
This looks good !
WHY?!? CALL THE DANG FILM "A Haunting in Venezia"! IT'S NOT THAT HARD!!!   ARE WE NOT GOOD ENOUGH? LEARN A LITTLE ITALIAN, AND CALL THE DANG THING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!
Jamie Dornan 😍😍😍❤️
Whaaaa!? that was a well edited trailer. First time I experienced a twist like that in a trailer lol. Was not expecting it to be a Poirot film
This is such a different vibe to both previous films where the trailers focused on some kind of cool mainstream music + showing off the star cast. Here instead were are focused only on the horror. I really like the difference here. Not that the previous two film trailers were bad, nah, I just like seeing Hercule Poirot in kind of a different situation than the usual.
I heard Michelle Yeoh speak and immediately became interested...and Tina Fey?!?!?!?! In a horror film??!?!?! I mean what the what?? Sept is gonna be amazing!!
Did they use the same font of Hill House?
After Michelle Yeoh won an Oscar, now there are many films that she will star in
A new Poirot movie? I'm there.
Fresh, fun, imaginative take in that continuing series of movies; I'M IN!
Poirot 😍
Can't wait. Am really enjoying his take on the Belgian detective
Who’s the actress @0:15 ?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did they crib from "A Haunting" with the music cue during the title reveal? same beat as the old tv show.
Trailer in italian?
This seems a bit weird. I liked Orient Express but got bored by Nile. We'll see how this goes.
Meh.
Where are the children?
How to ruin AC books part 3 by Kenneth B.
Very very loosely based on Halloween party I'm guessing lol. Looks fun though! I'm down for a Hercule Poirot horror flick lol
This is nothing like the book it's supposed to be based on.
David Suchet wants his role back.
I have read many Poirot stories, but I haven't read Hallowe'en Party, so everything in this trailer is very new to me.
Okay this one looks good.
Should have put a flashing lights warning before the trailer, buddies
Well, the trailer seems to hit all the usual boring horror tropes and cliches. Maybe the movie, having something to do with Agatha Christie, might be good tho
Fan fiction .. nothing more. Giving this a BIG miss
This doesn't even look scary.
cant wait
Hopefully this is pg13
🍿 🍺 🛋  🖥 , im all in for this
Another Poirot film? Yes please!
I'm so, so very happy we're still getting more Poirot films from Kenneth Branagh! This looks so good!
Michelle Yeoh is annoying
is this in the same universe as the detective movies with that guy? forgot his name, love those detective movies lol. If so, i imagine this would be something like scooby doo but more well, real and for adults/
"Try not to become a person of success, but rather try to become a person of value." _Albert Einstein
😍👏
Scary? No. Entertaining? Yes!
This time this part will be different and better than the previous two parts
They should’ve done it in Poveglia Island..👻
I don't know how I feel about this. It looks like a completely different style of movie that Poirot accidentally wandered into. I'll give it a chance though.
Looks about as interesting as most horror movies over the past few years.
Hercule Poirou is back, baby.
This looks brilliant
I'll have to rewatch his Frankenstein now...
I can't believe you got Kenneth Branagh in this. No wonder he looked familiar! It's always nostalgic seeing him on your channel.
There are no ghosts, so this story plays out exactly like a Scooby Doo story.
This looks incredible!!
Well, Gal Gadot isn't in it this time. That'a a plus. No need for the PS2 CG Nile background either.
this looks like it’ll be the best of the Kenneth Branagh Agatha Christie adaptations! such an eerie trailer!
From the looks of the trailer and the few photos on IMDB this appears to be unwatchable. Why do directors and DP's think they have to film everything 4 stops underexposed where you have to really strain to make out the image. Hard pass for me.
GOAT Michelle Yeoh. Because of her alone, I will watch this.
Hype
Me watching the trailer: Okay, just a regular horror film-  Poirot shows up: HOLY F**K THIS IS A POIROT FILM?!?!
pass
I got excited because I thought by the title it was in Venice Beach. Son of a...
I am detective Hercule Poirot, and I will deliver your.............?
Horror has been weak for 2023. After that great year of 2022 🥲
this looks so good
Looks lame AF
ruined the first two
i smell a solid 5-6 on imdb
This Kenneth Branagh detective  Hercule Periot trilogy and Knives Out series with Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc are the best set of suspense thriller murder mystery movies I have seen last few years all these movies are well written with great stories and performance
wow this looks terrible why make it a horror movie
As a movie, this looks very good and I'll likely see it. But as an adaption, it doesn't really resemble the book in the slightest. A very sharp turn from what the book likely intended the mood to be, but it might end up being worth it when communicating the overall message of the story. Either way, sign me up for this.
A whodunit but scary?? Heck yeah! Kenneth Branagh can do the whole Poirot series and I'd eat it all up each time. Can't wait!
I have loved these films. I watched the first 2 again this past weekend.   Love a good murder mystery
Loooks great
I’m guessing this is a separate “darker” offshoot of the other Agatha Christie movies with Kenneth Branagh?. I was confused af. Though this was random horror movie. I’m still baffled
Michelle Yeoh coming to slay again
I will never forgive Kenneth that he didn’t shoot this on film.
I wasn't a fan of the last movie, but I'm willing to give this one a chance.
Poirot: tonight, we are all afraid. We cannot hide from our ghost. Whether they are real or not.☠️👻💀
Ok one I need to get the book Hallowe'en Party and two I am so watching this! The cast alone is fantastic!
Another Poirot movie?? Sign me up!!!! Always love more Kenneth Branagh
I’m thinking this is another conjuring annabell movie. The hercule purro shows up. Lol
This looks rad!!!
This looks decidedly different from the book - will be interesting to see which elements were retained and which are original.
this looks better than the 2nd one .
When I just realized it a sequel murder in the boat film I'm like ehh idk cause murder on the train thing was really slow for me I actually that this was like based on true events stuff
I had no idea this was gonna be another Poirot film. Bloody hyped.
Boy, I’d hate to be in a cinema having my ears almost blown out from this teaser.
Halloween party is so clever and a fun mystery! Interested to see what they do with this!
Very interesting!
A new movie about detective Poirot. Saw the first 2. Sign me up definitely.
The sprinkle of horror is exactly what this needs.
Well it can't be any worse than the last one (CGI on the Nile).
They're making it better and better love the 3rd installment
WTF is this ???😆😆 looks like a new conjuring movie ... nothing to do with Hercule Poirot !!!
So after directing an Oscar winning movie, Kenneth Branagh decided to make another one of these movies?
How did this one get made? The last one bombed.
Love, Love, Love it! my Poirot-Branagh is back😍
I will see this movie but I wish David Suchet was playing Hercule Poirot. No one is as good.
is this a film Hercule Poirot
I really wanna watch this but I would also like to see Benoit Blanc solve this
Well, this isn't where I expect the Poirot movies to go.
I was expecting the red font and the epic pop music cover like the 2 previous films but yet I'm intrigued.
Seems like it would’ve been better as a video game than a movie
Hercule Poirot is solving supernatural horror now? Interesting! 🤔
This looks like a total flop…seriously…nothing about this was scary, intriguing or anything. Just notable faces.
MOOOM DAAAD... UNCLE HERCULE IS BACK...
Hope something new other than usual horrors😊
Beth Dutton
Always up for a new Poirot adventure!
Interesting 👍
Man, between Artemis Fowl, Belfast and these two latest Poirot films, Kenneth Branagh must've been a busy man these past few years.
👆BTS V - i guess he likes Venice 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈tragedies
THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED
Can't wait
Looks like the most boring film i saw definitely wont be watching or recommending just by the trailer
Looking fwd to this
Oh wow! I had no idea that Kenneth Branagh was returning to direct and star as Hercule Poirot again in 2023?! 😱 I’ve personally really liked this series so far! 🎞️👏♥️
This looks pretty mid, ngl
Is this the sequel to Murder on the Orient Express??
I have mixed feelings about this... Agatha Christie never leaned on the supernatural side. She kept things simple. They recently did a supernatural twist on Nacny Drew on CW which was very bad. I don't want to see that repeated  Idk why they didn't go with one of the more popular or well received works. Halloween Party was not Agatha Christie at her best.
Wow kenneth
Honestly shocked they even made another one after the utter disaster they had releasing the last one.
Seems interesting.
I loved the last 2 Poirot adaptations and this looks very unique so I’m definitely excited
Yikes. Movies to get white ppl turnt
Awesome
Looks good
This movie is based on the book Hallowe’en party. I already saw the episode for it but I’m looking forward the movie
So this is a Hercule Poirot story you`d think the trailer would emphasise that more as it would be the films main selling point....this feels like they`ve stripped out all the British references to make it fit a Venetian theme(Venice being cooler than rural UK i suppose) as its a lesser known story it might work well though...
Michelle Yeoh!!
Hopefully, this isn't as awful as DOTN.
Looks good!
Better than my expected
Great teaser ✨
so the romantic place with the boats is actually the home of evil? knew it.
This looks interesitng. I'm glad seeing Riccardo Scamarcio in this.
Very intrigued and looking forward to seeing it!
I am here only for Michelle Yeoh,can't wait ..
Everything Kenneth Branagh directed or stared in has been fantastic and this looks amazing can't wait or it.
Poirot vs ghosts?
Thank you for continuing the movie series ❤ This looks amazing.
Nice 😌
The trailer looks funny asf
That seems interesting and original, but I really don't see the link with halloween party novel...
I CANT WAITTT FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT !!!!!
Ugh good story ruined by wooden performances😩
I LOVE THIS! I have been waiting for this trailer since the movie was announced and it is so amazing to see them dip this series into a bit of psychological horror.
Michelle Yeoh 🥹🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎥
But Why The Ghost Not Look so Ghostly Anyone notices it
Meh.
This looks good! And I love Michelle Yeoh, she is an amazing actress
I was starting to wonder if Poirot was going to be in this.
Hope this one will be good ! The last one was pretty bad 😢
Waaaaait… there’s a third one of those ???
Honestly thought this was a sequel to hill house from the same director of the show and midnight mass. Was sorely disappointed when hercule poirot showed up😢
Fun fact: this is based on Agatha Christie's 1969's Hallowe'en Party as well being the first film adaptation of said story.
This is gonna be so different from the other two Hercule Poirot movies Kenneth Branagh did. I can already tell.
Poirot is back 🔥🔥
Michelle Yeoh working overtime these past few years. Disney projects like Shang Chi and ABC, Netflix stuff The Witcher spin-off, Gunpowder Milkshake and The School for Good and Evil, animations with The Minions and Paws of Fury and she’s even in Star Trek, The New Transfomers Rise of Beasts and even James Cameron’s Avatar 3/4. You can pretty much say that she’s Everything Everywhere All At Once.
okay we LOVEEEE agatha christie and this cast is absolutely stacked! can't wait!
The cast are mind-blowing
❤
Whoa whoa what is this? This was a more surprising trailer than most I've seen recently. Didn't not expect it to continue Detective Poirot's stories.
Agatha Christie feat Scooby-Doo
"Everyone who ever lived here falls victim to some tragedy"....nothing like bad publicity for poor Venice to start this trailer...LOL.
I'm a massive fan of the bbc poirot series, but I have to say, I've kinda fallen in love with this version of the character
Detective Hercule Poirot😮, so Agatha Christie😍
That ghost looks so unscary lmao. Upcoming flop
This looks great, love the horror tone. I really enjoy these movies so I’m looking forward to seeing this one!
This trailer looks very dim. I know it's night time but can barely see much
trailer looks shite, ngl
Wow...this looks awesome.
This movie looks so bad 😂
😴
And Then They were None was one! AMAZING! BOOK!
This feels like the haunted mansion but actually scary lol
It seems like Movie Industry going HORROR Ways this year.
Michelle Yeoh is everywhere all at once and i love it! keep killin it!
This looks like an absolute snore fest
Seen this 100 times before. Nexxxxxt
Wait this isn't a horror movie but another detective film
My mom is a huge fan of the Agatha puzzle games, my sister of the books. Another Agatha film well sign us up.
I've not read any Agatha Christie but this looks good
This looks just as bad as the last two. Branagh really needs to stop
Looks like he grew his mustache back
After the disappointment of DOTN, this looks like a giant step up!!!!!
Please release in Hindi language
Michelle Yeoh meet Hercule Poirot
I thought this was a horror movie until I saw the one and only!
There is not enough champagne to fill the nile this time 😢
I honestly nearly fell asleep watching that trailer
My guilty pleasure movies: the Da Vinci Code movies and these murder mysteries lol
Very loosely based on Hallowe'en Party, I must say. It was a children's party, they were bobbing for apples and an unlikable girl was drowned. In England. As many murders as Poirot has been around and as many people who were hung after he caught them, you'd think he'd be knee deep in ghosts.
Can't wait to see it !
I'm in
Wow I didn't see that coming
thank you for this aspect ratio
Love that Ken is using his Oscar cred to spend the rest of his career making opulent Poirot flicks 😊
really excited for this one
I’m not a big book reader, but I think it’s cool to just add ghosts to this franchise
That's...certainly different from the first two movies!
Where is Ken Curtis and royal dano
BORA LA BIXO VIVA O AGATHAVERSO Esse filme vai ser do caramba
Michelle Yeoh is everywhere these days! Honestly lol
OH NICE SUPER SPOOKY
Tina Fey???
yes!!!!!
cant wait
Tina Fey doing a thriller movie? Yes please.   I love it when comedians do serious roles.
Jauc crusteau against ghosts? A murder on the orient express but with ghosts? The haunting of hill house but with jauc crusteau? I’m in
I really am enjoy these recent adaptations
Tina Fey in a horror movie? WHAT?
Will have the watch this with the audio muted, seems scary
CANT WAIT TO SEE JUDE HILL
Kinda odd they're releasing this a month and a half before Halloween. October doesn't have much coming out. Kinda bizarre that Haunted Mansion is coming in July, this in September, when both would have been prime for October!!!
Spooky scary skeletons~ Send shivers down my spine~
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE
I'm very interested in it but not gonna lie, many people will not get this is a Poirot movie so you should advertise it in a better way or they will never know
Michelle Yeoh's in it! WOW!!!!!
The trailer is already giving a vibe of an amazing movie. This looks interesting!!!!
"Halloween's Party" with the primary focus on horror-like elements turned up a couple of notches?   That's... brave. And kind of original if you ask me. Original enough to get me a tiny bit excited.
Jumpscare in washroom mirror is too mainstream now.
I said it about the last one (and I was right), this will probably be bad exactly like the two before this one, but I'll see it, I'll just be going in with no hopes!
I realy love these movies
Hercules has to see the ghost of Bouc
You had me at Bryce Dallas Howard, you pulled me with Tina Fey
Another Version of Evelyn from another universe
OMG the trilogy is complete ❤
Looks MUCH better than 1 & 2!!! 🎉
Well it's releasing on my birthday. I'll be 32 and get more depressed.
Michelle Yeoh, Tina Fey & Jamie Dornan makes  A Haunting In Venice a must watch in September!
That's exactly on my birthday
This kind of horror audience need
I really love Agatha's books and films, Kenneth Branagh is also on point. I am waiting for the next work
Why did Poirot shaved her mustache at the end of the last movie? And now he grows it back again after at least 8-10 years?
The detective Is back!!!
Kenneth Branagh is a great actor, detectives are exactly his element. I'll definitely be at the cinema
The trailer is great and I hope the movie won't let you down either. Caste crazy ❤
Looks much more interesting than the first 2
At first, I thought it had something to do with the universe as "a haunting in connecticut" but turns out it's another adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel. Not disappointed about it,just pointing something out.
ആത്മാവേ പോ..
Cryptkeeper: Some People Said don't Believe in Ghosts, which brings us the Foolish Mortals of Tonight's Tale, it's a Twisted whodunit about a Famous Detective who's about to get the Ghoulish case of his Lifetime in a Nasty Nugget i Call "A Haunting in Venice".
Thought this was a Don't Look Now modern remake until Poirot showed up, it looks good but let's hope it's better than the previous two movies
certified Hercule Poirot moment
Is this Ewan McGregor doing Poirot?
"Agatha Christie" meets "Tales from the Crypt".
No comment 😮‍💨
Super excited.. Let's wait 🤞
Kennth Branaugh is like Baz Lurrmann without the vision.
I'm all in! 🙌
“Tonight, we are all afraid.”
Nice❤
