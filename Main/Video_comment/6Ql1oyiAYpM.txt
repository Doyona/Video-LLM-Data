Is that Toadfish?
And he sold 100 billion 😅
at 11-25 DM knows she’s missed a  trick here
He doesn't care about money he's happy with his invention and wants it out on market fair play to him
I hope he's done well with the product.
Lovely presentation has the total human touch!!
I've seen people use similar tools in China
Erm these lore are totally oblivious to how normal folk live.  I’d do that tiling myself to save the extortionate price tilers charge.  If you’ve got a brain and the guts to do it.  It’s doable.  Believe me. I’m prime example.

Good invention, good bloke, win.
you drill the concrete flag then how do you get it over the traffic light or lamppost?
That was actually really reasonable. Peter or Deborah would’ve asked for 40-50%
Just to let you know im out...........yeah no worries sound mate 🤣🤣
What Jim Jefferies would look like if he got much bigger
What a cracking fella. best of luck to him
Hes said yep already.
One top lad  no messing about  this is it   take it or leave it   love it
No sory your rong
Follow his videos on YouTube, love his easy going attitude 😅
If peter is worth 300mill then this guy is a days  interest.
Great job on the defender. Nice to see your lass getting involved...😅
He done work for burton and bennett
North West lad..👏👏
4 years later, you find this on temu for £4.99
He was PERFECT!
Sarah, nails it
I hope Toadie got an investment
Some people come out with great inventions.
Looks like Meccano to me
Propa yorkshire lad lol😂
Love that guy!
😂👍🏻👏🏻
This man's idea is great, so many apartments with pipes and how to to cut things well. He desires a medal and the money..
Very fair offer from Sarah - he'd thought of the idea but had no idea what to do with it or where to go, and Sarah was going to do all that for only 30%.  He was lucky, although it doesn't seem to have taken off too much.
What a guy calm collected and delivered

Is he the brother of Peter Kay
Never say your preferred dragon
He definitely went down the pub after this 😂
But he's very honest bloke
I miss the old background music, it was more business style
If toadfish from neighbours walked in I’d give him my money no questions
Good old yorkshire man 😂
LEGEND NO TIME WAISTING
Some of the flakiest and most nonsensical reasons for not investing from the other dragons that I’ve ever heard.
this guys got his own page on social media... it's incredible... top guy!
I honestly think Sarah was even generous. This was just an invention, all the rest of the business work still had to be done and he doesn't look like the guy who would add value to that. I expected a bid of 40 to 50% honestly.
Straight up, no nonsense, northern bloke. Probably knows his way around a pie and pint and a set of darts.
Can’t you just use of of those profile tools? That’s what I do with pipes.
I’m a sparky & id use it for helping to position boxes & possible lights or sockets. Maybe wherever there’s point through walls. Clever little tool
Idk why this one made me cry   -G
4 years later, i havent seen this item anywhere 😅
Keiran
if handled properly, that's the sort of product you can retire on.
This is exactly the tool I needed when I completely messed up the downstairs bathroom in my first house. It ended up sitting unfinished for over a year until I could afford to get a tradesman in to sort it.
It can't be easy to get two of the ugliest women in the world in the same room.
I just feel being English and all!!! That he's off to the local weather spoons for a cold pint of Foster's, or hineakan s 😅😅😅
Nice guy, hope the product done well for them both.
Does anybody know if the product was successful?  Ive not seen it anywhere.

That’s where Toadfish ended up. Weird accent mind.
Theo is back, but out of position?
"My husband is great at DIY and he'd get a tile fitter to do this" - yeah, that's the point, he's making it easier.
Those suits clearly don't know a thing about DIY tools. That tool is brillant but it is not unique. Similar tools have been invented long time ago in Asia. Sarah is the wisest person here.
I’d watch a really show about that guy.’s life.  He was charming in his own down to earth way. 😊
Dragons den is crap now, I call it the food and drink show, they not interested in good inventions
Good bloke that, Tiernan Pilkington
He seemed more awkward and shy than cool and collected.
He sold billions of these and now lives on a boat in Monaco with 15 twenty something models. Good on ya son 😂
Smart guy, I don’t know why it’s so difficult to understand. 70% of a multi national company is far better than 100% of nothing. And with the dragons backing she is not going to let it fail.
Never ceases to amaze me how divorced from reality the dragons are 😆
This original series is so much better than Shark Tank.
The product exists for very long time, it's nothing new
One point people might miss is and o ou timy % of the world will know this about an invention thing albeit it’s still human behaviour but she’s his last hope so his 15% was rightfully adjusted….and when she pitched to him about similar and then the mooring stuff that’s another good take….good luck to emmm
Lovely bloke :D
She was right in the US they will find a market for it they use carpenters a lot more than other countries they will love it
Terrible negotiator
And now, you see that product being used all over the world on YouTube clip. Not this exact  design, a upgraded design, but still, this guys idea is a hit not a miss, bet all the dragons heard was paton pending..
Is the pitch really about the pitch. Or is it about scking your dick and ego ? If it's the latter, I will not accept your funds
I wish this bloke all the luck in the world ! Brilliant invention.
Sound
Where’s the business now?
What a nice man.
“Like and follow for moreeee flooring videos” what a guy lol
9:07 Poor Leo, look at his face 😂😂
The walk off deal haha 😂
Still in my top 5 😂
That was class. Made up for them 2. Hope it works out. Great pair. 💰 🤞 💰 💰
I see they are sold on Amazon and there are several tutorials in google. This really happened.
Good lad
"You gotta be pretty advanced DIY to have that kind of tool right?"...... It was a drill love....
I always think this show is funny because the dragons dont make their money funding entrepreneurs like this. They make it buying resources.

He is better with numbers and more to the point than most pitchers
Yep.
Debbie 😂you so arrogant, get over yourself
In china to produce about 80 cents
50 yrs old ffs😂
Straight to the point. No buzzwords. No D I S R U P T I O N promises in the sky. Agrees with their contributions.   Gets what he came for — a business mind to take his product forward. Brilliant.
No counter offer?  Guy has lost his screws.
So how did he get on?
I like this guy so much. Honest, chill and calm. So happy for him, I hope it’s a huge success.
This is probably my favourite pitch, and the tool looks really fun to play / fidget with.
The dragon clearly never use tools. They always sound so uneducated and ignorant regarding tools. 😂
This was a rare episode for me in that it actually made me smile at the end. I’m so glad Sarah made him the offer.
Would like to know how people did things before this came along
He is a legend
What a legend! I expected the video to be a lot worse but he was dead straight about his flaws, and he got the deal. Brilliant! 👏
I love people like this guy, no mask and not trying to impress anyone, just being himself. Really rare nowadays. I hope he becomes successful.
It's brilliant xx
"Will this sell in my stores? No"  How do you know, Theo?. You haven't tried.
It's not cutting edge, has been around in tiling for years
Nice video
It baffles me how Sara 'Miss Piggy' Davies is an entrepreneur because she's clueless.
That’s what dragons like a straightforward thinking straight shooter no messing about or trying to fob them off with materialistic possibly false numbers
Old mate had a snort before facing the dragons innit
😂😂😂😂 Look like his just come from the pub across the road gone up the lift done his pitch ect then couldn't walk out quick enough back down the lift back across the road to the pub "How did it go Teirnan" "It went alright" with no explanation if he got a dragon or not.
This dude is my spirit animal from now on
Lmao that pen. 😂
Hes a traveller
Yeah you gotta love people like that - I think he just came in with a "nothing to lose' attitude, he was honest  with them from the start which is always a good ploy and he was straight to the point which I liked 👍
The amount of times I've needed something like that.
Such a nice honest fella which is rare in the den
What a legend
I think Sara Davies crushed on him.
proper bloke , love him

The definition of the honest no bullsh*t English working man.
It can be quite unique, tilin
Yea,ok ,yup...he's not giving them any reason to argue 😂 love it,he made a great product,he's so chilled he's off so pub straight after
3D printer now.... Priceless
What a complete tool
Its "tradesman" ... not "tradesperson"... how many women work in construction in real life ?

I’m now on Cameo 🤷🏼‍♂️, really not sure why people want messages from me but okay 👍🏻, just so you know 🤗, loving the support all 🙏🏻
hello
What about environmental impact?  Plastic products
Now he seems like a guy you would want to have a pint with ❤
I always wonder what Toadfish Rebecci did after Neighbours.
What the dragons are reluctant to say is-"I could not work with a slob"...
forty one" fousand"   I'm out...
Best not to invest in someone who wipes their nose with their hand...an adult not a child...
Poor chap, I really hope he succeeds in business.
Salt of the earth.
He answered every question with an eehhh and a sniff. Love it.
He accepted the offer at 11:34, but in such a casual manner that none of the dragons picked up on it 😁
Love how he said yep, and they didn't even realise he'd closed.
I am glad this has worked out for him and hope he is successful!
What a top guy.
What an absolute legend
The fella's spot on, maybe he could have got her down 5% or so but it seems that was within his margins. Nice work!
I love this guy and his mentally
G'wan Teirnan!
3:05 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sometimes Peter makes comments about how they dress, not this time
some man😂
I feel bad for him🥹
It’s the pen in his ear that gets me 😂
The funny part to me is not when he says he'll take the offer. But rather when Sarah spent all that time trying to raise her own value in order to ask for more, and it was her just talking about her achievements and stuff like that and after she's done the dude's like "yep". Then awkward silence and she's again the next to talk. Lmfao. That's so funny. That pause makes it look like there is something she was waiting for. A reaction. A compliment for her achievements. But the dude hit her with a "yep". And then, while the awkward silence is going on, the cameraman zooms on Peter's face, which speaks for itself. ABSOLUTE GOLD.
This guy is like the exact opposite of Barry the water condenser machine guy
Dude is so humble haha you gotta love him. Arrogant entrepreneurs get rejected and start telling the dragons why theyre wrong or insulting them, this lad just thanks them for the feedback
Just a nice guy, inventing something, not like a lot of the flash, suited n booted, big, fake, cheesy smiles. Just a  down to earth guy.
I have actually seen some form of these.   I used a version that was made for drop ceiling tiles, and cutting them to fit all angles.
Love him, no nonsense.
why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
Can't believe how terrible the majority are at reading people. He is incredibly nervous.
Was Theo smoking a vape? 😄
Sara Davies has all the skills he lacks.  And he knows it, so there's no thinking.  70% of a hopping business is better than 100% of none.
Delighted for him and also Sarah for giving him a chance!
Camera work getting the shot of him playing with his wedding ring while thinking about the offer is magic , tells you everything about that man .
Some dudes who have likely never worked with their hands before try to tell a DIY-er how useful their tool is.
So they are now pulling in Sales of 15 mill pounds. Good on him. Straight shooter honest chap. Well done 🎉🎉
I believe most of the Dragons were wrong here. He has invented a brilliant product. I would have bought it and always had in my toolcase. It is that good.
Sarah definitely seen something 😂
The world needs more Teirnans. What a guy :D
This product will sell well in SEA.
I wonder if this is sold online. My father diys a lot. I think he'd love something like this.
dragons dont understand this type of work , they never got dirty in there entire life , i bet not a single dragon that room. knows how too do any sort of trade where it be painting . tiling ect  they dont know what you have bro
Fantastic product , you can also use this in furniture , kitchen cabinets (think ikea) , wall cover (laminate of wood) , tiles for toilets , etc . Only thing is the inventor lacks the foresight on where this can be use . If he mentioned all this, I bet the dragons will be interested
Burton & Bennett guy
He's a straight arrow
Unfortunately he is a bit thick
This chap deserves the help he has received from a dragon!
why wouldn't I simply use a circle?
Laidback but his product is still on the market and the company is worth a million.
😂 brilliant
Beautiful
The end of the is hilarious. Good on him.
what a legend hahha
In the Den, there must be a provision to call a related Rechnician to evaluate the practical utility of a new Tool
i love this guy
Anyone know how this guys doing now in 2024 ?
top bloke
If Rory the Seaweed Guy made a pitch:
Sara is just the best! Most wholesome dragon!
Deborah's reason was weird to me.
I so wanna be his friend, I love how he talks straight and honest, you can see it in his face. A true lad.
That looks well handy. I'd totally buy one off Amazon if they were around the £20-£30 mark.
Beefy Bert has come a long way since Horrid Henry. This man is a class act 👌
I would absolutely need this now that I know it exists  , iys a really good idea and they'd know if they ever tried to do any tiling. its all fun and games till you get near a door or radiator.
Guy seems to be doing great. Company worth more than 1M and he has over 100k followers on his personal instagram. Nice investment by Sara
Seems like a good tool
What special tools was she talking about? A power drill?
I love no nonsense tradesmen.
Great guy wish him all the best
This guy is awesome lol
CarDoctor advice : hire a tiler mate.
Sarah is so cool
I love how he said 'yeah' the first time and they didn't realize he was agreeing to the offer, so Sara asked more formally and he was still just like '...yeah'.
Great deal 😊
I dont ever plan to do any DIY but i might buy one because i like the cut of his jib 😂
He is the epitome of good ol' working class British metal, who is also an innovator. At the same time, I'd imagine him to be a good family man and the type of lad who I'd love to have a pint with at the local pub. Love his attitude. Absolute straight-shooter with nothing sugar-coated along with being a great listener. He could do great for his business if he becomes a DIY influencer.
Deborah  obviously does not have the insight how smart en convenient this tool is. Awfully missed chance.
Brilliant.
10 min. after I watched this video and Im still laughing.
Great video Yes The truth needs to be told There will be many problems ahead with infrastructure and from lost petrol/diesel tax revenue there will be huge increases for electricity costs All electric will take another 40 years in a perfect world I do not see this happenng All manufacturers presently Have major problems with debt management           astru tu
What a nice guy. A refreshingly down to earth individual, no muss no fuss, good luck to them.
What was the outcome ?
Typical Mancs lad, no bs, no artsy fartsy. Job done, celebrate with a pie and a pint next, cheers lads 😂
Carpet fitter dont you mean dodgy gypsy tarmacer
Tej lalvani: MARKET!!!! NO MARKET??
the Den should have a Devil's advocate to point out what prats the dragons are sometimes
i have rewired,  replumbed retiled five houses,  how i wish i'd had one of these.
I might be biased because I’m a fellow Mancunian but what a top guy! Hope he’s doing well.
By time my grandad died he had loads of different tools built over the years. I dont think people even try no more. Wheres back in the day you could ask someone if they have something and 9 times out of 10 they do.
i would just use a bit of cardboard to make a template,,SIMPULLS
What a lad. The way he had the pen in his ear at the end 😂😂😂
Never say who your preferred dragon is
Theo and Toucker should be on Dragon's Den together. Cos it would look like brothers.
Guy's pitch was like watching the puzzle part on the Krypton Factor.
good northern lad!
Man knows his strength and limits. No but, no if.. straight business. The focus is to enter the market with his invention. Nice one mate .
What a lovely bloke. I wish him every success with this very clever product. I hope he goes on to make millions.
I really like this guy.
this moment is priceless. 11:53
Sept 2023 and you can't buy this product anywhere. So what happened?
Such a likeable guy
He's at $1 mill net worth in 2023
Even if I NEVER used it ..I would still buy it just to have it in my house.  Someone would be welcome to borrow it. I would frame it or hang on my wall in shed.  Wish him all the best. What a cool guy.
Best guy I have seen on shark tank in years…Just a normal person…💯
Why does he have a pen behind his ear? did he come straight from work 😂
next level this guy.  amazing humble and confident disposition.
Seems the dragons don’t see the value of the product when they themselves haven’t experienced the problem the product is solving.
company is worth around 1mil in 2023.
Anyone know how  Keiran did  he deserved success
I love peoples imagination
How many ways did they pronounce his name? 😵‍💫
What a good real bloke!! so glad for him!
A great bloke … backbone of Britain and salt of the earth … much respect 😊
How did this company work out?  Asking in July 2023.
Boss.
bro i am a floor layer and i was looking for this for time, welldone
I like him.
I love Sarah❤️❤️❤️
officially my favorite pitch xD
He’s a smart and sweet guy.

He is looking to get the product in production for 41 K. Sara offers him the money. She gots a company that can make the product. Clever 😅
Top lad.
I love this guy.  So unpretentious.  My favourite in the den so far.
Top geezer he knows he's stuff he does not buklshit like others I have seen glad he got the investment
Well done to him for getting the deal, straight forward, can't beat that. Wish him all the luck.
What a great guy, I would love to work with him.
Cracking tool for trade and DIY. Hope the lad does well.
Manky lad! 😂😎🎸🤘
Looks like he's from the travelling  Community So he should do a good job
This is the kind of guy that will bluff you out with him holding a pair of two's and you holding a full house.
What a lovely guy I'm really pleased for him
Would make a great CEO to be honest
Good man Tiernan. Hope is works/worked out well for him. No BS, like it 👏
If the Bloke was savvy he would have called up a tiler and said can I borrow you for a day I'll pay your daily wages. Get him to come down use the tool and ask would you buy this tool. If he says yes and I see other tradesman using the tool they would have been eating out of his hand. But good luck to hi.
Love him 👏🏻
Brilliant bloke and the right dragon 🐉 🎉🎉 is it in the market now?
Hello
What a lovely seeming bloke. I hope his product had all the success it deserved.
Is he a gypsy? Looks like one.
off into the sunset like Ryu!
They're out of touch expecting big companies to respond to one guys email without their kind of clout. It would've just hit a spam bin. That's the point of going to them bar the cash.
This product is good
I'm so glad Sara invested in Tiernans product....He deserves it.
I want one
The product has been out for ages guys. more than 2 years.
Amazing i think its a brilliant product
glad he got the offer,  seems like a genuine bloke, I hope it does well for both parties...
Theo is a massive bell end.
That's a top man right there. Lost a lot of his share but he understands that without a dragon he hasn't really got a business, just a product. 30% of nothing ain't much.
Ethereum ❤
h3 l00k5 l1k3 4 guy d4t typ35 l1k3 di5
His nickname is Mr. Horizontal
Chinese have copied this years ago, didn't realise it was his design. Hope he did well
His negotiations were spot on. His dragons solves the production cost before he leaves the room. He was obviously happy with selling 30% due to his lack of entrepreneurial skills. 70% of future profit to let go of the wheel and sit back counting cheques is a no brainier.
Straight to the point. Top man
Thought he was gonna say yep again
Yep
Well done to the guy hope it works out for him. It’s always good to see someone succeed.
yeh is the product the one on tiktok but not sure how long ago this was filmed so we know it's got marketing value. now. so if thats a bootleg product in china he's gonna get shafted.
Bravo!
I swear I’ve seen a similar tool online being used in China. Not quite the same, but did something similar.
He’s like thanks for the investment okay bye 😂😂😂😂😂 Laters, I thought that was a really good idea
So all the others bailed out pressuring him and making him feel like his tool is not worth it and its not gonna make it, so he can accept a ridiculous offer. To be honest he doesn't seem like he has the marketing skills to put his prodcut out there, but 30% for 40k is straight up theft. Better than nothing ofc, but if he had the right people besides him to believe  in him and convince him that he can make it with or without the dragons, he wouldn't agree for such a low price cause that's a great product.
Good deal
4:18 Omg that countryside accent, why people dont speak proper English in England?
These multi millionaires are GREEDY and RUDE. Unhappy ppl.
Pen behind the ear on the way out did it for me 😂
Any updates on  how this chilled man got on , I really hope he and Sara were successful
surprised he even got an offer and at 30 percent it was every generous
I love Irish accent ❤️❤️❤️
😆 The last lady dragon sounds more excited than the actual owner of the product
Good humble legend!
If you are selling to the trades, make it out of an Alloy rather than plastic.... who is going to spend £20 on something that will get smashed up in their tool bag before they even get the chance to use it... Tradesmen would rather pay double and have tools that last !
he didnt even explain the product without being specifically asked, im actually surprised.
This is the kind of turn around that brings a tear to my eye. This guy deserves to make millions.
Good bloke. Saw a good offer when it smacked him in the face. So many penny pinchers go on this show with no intention of getting investment, only to advertise their products. They offer 5-10% which gives the dragons very little incentive to make the business work. I'd offer 80%, because I'd rather have 20% of something, than 95% of nothing. The dragons' money isn't the main thing you should value. The more of the business you offer them the more they will try to make the business work. 30% was an excellent deal, no wonder he grabbed it. It might have been better for him if he gave more than 30%, but some people won't understand that.
The thing that always annoyed me about Theo, is that the guy loves to waffle on for about 10 minutes before getting to the point.
Forget Duncan guillotine its theo the executioner from now on lol
How did he do?
hes letting the product do the talking 👌
Why did Theo blow him off like that, shows he’s never done a graft proper job before. That would definitely sell in DIY stores, most tradesmen in that work would Benefit from this tool
it would be better if it’s a ruler with a detachable bit
If Jenny was still here she'd be out!
I love Sarah
Karl Pilkington damn sure ordered one of these already
Did it ever do well
What a bloke
Good lad
She said the avg DIY user wouldn’t have equipment to drill holes like that? I don’t think she’s done much DIY before. Everyone’s got a mate with one, or got one in their garage
Theo's way of going out was just unnecessarily mean
Just a blue collar man good on him!
Any update on this?
This is what all of us North men are like. We don't waste time with bullshit.
Disgusting dig from Deborah Meaden on Tej.
Most focused and relaxed guy I've ever seen...
I actually love his no nonsense attitude, straight to the point and just a normal fella trying to make a quick buck with a fantastic idea, seen these on sites to this day so hopefully he has made it
he should sell it to tradesmen stores. Like GR8 i can see this product easily going into stores like that, and wickes and all.
Brits are calmer when doing bsn than americans
Hi greetings from Britain I have watched this show and it is immersive
Working in building and construction I've encountered a fair few people who cannot read nor write. Measuring is mostly done by eye and the outcome is, well.... Fittings around pipes and cutting out are rarely neat. Quite often you don't have space for a pencil to mark up. Same counts for cut outs of spotlights for example. So many tasks could do with tools to make things easier. Hats up to this man to not just suck up and do the job but also to keep his creativity alive by inventing something and putting it out there. 👍
This has to be my favourite ever deal. Go Tiernan!
Their arguments are very flawed because none of them understand the utility of it. Why use a screwdriver if a drill will do it faster and easier?
i like this guy :)
This tool is useless
Who would want this in there toolbox? Literally any man
He should be the prime minister there wouldn't be no strikes
He’s now worth more than Elon Musk
I want one - he was wrong about electricians who often route pipework ( conduit )
Its perfect how did they not all throw offers at him.. you cam have bigger ones for more industrial applications too like ground workers would love this tool.. i can take pictures of what they end up doing on my site because they dont have it.. and the tilers especially they just cut squares holes around the pipes most times!
I’m so happy this guy didn’t go home empty handed
ah the power of an northern accent came through
Just sell it on amazon and ebay?
Screwfix is part of Kingfisher group
i want one , been tiling years
'Could be quite advanced to have that kit at home, do you not think?'   No Sara, I don't. A drill and some holesaw bits is not 'advanced kit'
The wordplay is strong in this one! 🙂
Love the dramatic music and the "im out" followed by "yeh no bother" 😂😂
5:56 “so you only back a racehorse when you know which ones won” Thats absolutely spot on! That guy is clearly clueless on this and got exposed.
This is the exact type of guys who should get big funding instead of the usual dropshippers, repackagers & copy-pasters.
Propa bloke why can’t everyone be that chilled and funny 👍
Type a guy you could have a good pint with
If I faced Debra I would never try to pull the wool over her eyes😄❤
Honestly, I'd trust this guy with my car keys. He seems a really salt of the earth type. Top bloke.
I want one.  Would buy in a heartbeat, especially at 20 pounds.  But, I also have a 3D printer, and can make my own.
I'm an electrician. Where can I buy one?
Love this guy
Thank you very much for this very helpful informative video!
I really like his attitude
I loved every second of this.
Sara looked besotted the entire time... She was beaming like she thought he was the cutest thing in the world
I usually root for most of the entrepreneurs that come on the show but something about this guy makes me really hope he succeeds.
08:49 I notice how Sarah's beliefs are confirmed by Deborah. See how she smiles and swallows. That green light was enough to confirm that she should invest.  I think the product is excellent.
I love the product. He's done amazingly well.
Get a compass with a pencil job done.
Like the guy. Honest. Straight to the point. Do wonders man
I did my own tiling rather than fork out loads for a tradesperson. Came out great and I get lots of compliments and propositions to do others.
This tiling tool has been around for years .
Brilliant lad and brilliant Sara .. wish you every success
Quite galling for the many entrepreneurs who spend thousands on suits for their pitches. But I guess he had the look of a tradesman.
I'm still unclear how the machine works
Love it, no bullshit, straight to the point.
He knows what he wanted, simple. Well done
I use the tile itself, mark on centre twice, then I use my square. Job Done.
A very impressive bloke.
US SHARK TANK is way better...
Win win, there's no need to complicate life init? this guys a legend
Fcking love the attitude and Pragmatism
9:55 she did say the US, entirely different
I DIY put down a bathroom floor in lockdown and wish I had this tool, to get round all the pipes etc!
This was the best offer acceptance in the history of Dragons' Den.  😂😂😂
What a leg!
Any else sus about him wiping his nose every now and then......👀 No wonder that explains his confidence........... iykuk
£41,000 for a business which hasn't sold a single item yet is a massive punt from Sara. Honestly think she could have asked for 40 or 45% and got it. Great stuff though.
too many puns
I’m glad he got the offer from Sarah Davies and hope his company is doing well.
I think he also won her over and could have negotiated her down a little at least a buy back option. Bit of missing business savvy but good enough to win a dragon over. Greatest of luck to him
The best thing abt Dragon's Den (other than the great sales pitches) are the ridiculously cheesy but accurate puns the announcer uses. Haha
One of the setup guys in my company (running lathes) actually uses this product and manipulated it in such a way we can make sure forged parts are within printed tolerance
Sniffing, hands in pockets. Please spare me the praise below. Whether this product is good or not. This isn't how you present. If his product was not OK, then this upload would probably be named, 'The worst, most unprepared pitch ever' - Sad that he has got so much praise in the comments section.
Is this a shark tank copy?
Propa lad! Cheers
just based of his appearance on the show don't know him in person obviously but I want him to succeed
The smile on Sara's face when Deborah dropped out said it all, an offer was going in.
I need one of these!!
I love his attitude ✨
Why all the narratorional puns?
I see these everywhere now
Hahahahahahahahahahaha, I think they will work extremely well together. And I have been in the building industry for many years. This product is spot on!
Okay yeah. Iight no problem. - A wise man.
I could feel him just wanting to say "oh ffs, get to the point, you want in or not?" 😅 He's the John Smith's no nonsense guy in real life haha
There’s already that exact tool in the industry. And it’s made from metal. Been around for years
Very likable guy …
An honest man has nothing to fear
No thrills pitch here’s what it is here’s what it does more pitches should be like this
Very honest guy, no BS about him. Knew his product, knew where he needed help and what the investment was for. I hope this guy did well 💪
What an absolute chad
100% tradesman not diy
This episode creates me a huge smile..  The offer is good.. ok accept..
He has a YouTube channel, it's called "pipeEASY"
Absolute Chad
Oh man when Deborah turned him down, it felt like watching her kick a puppy. But it was awesome to see him perk up again and get an offer. I hope he's doing well
Remember guys, the Gatekeepers aren't always right...
What a dude God bless him
How can they turn down this amazing product?!
Northerners are a special breed ❤️
Surprised he didn't get a "dressing down" from Peter about his untucked short sleeve shirt
Korg energy
What a lovely dude, I was so worried he wont get an offer.
These adverts are a joke
He is straight to the point. I ve watched this video thrice just for his politeness.
Hits different when its not called shark tank
Sara has the injection moulding company ready to start production, it’s a offer he couldn’t refuse.
Job done >> Walks off with swagger... 😎 "Cheers guys!" 🙌🍻 😂🔥 ✔🌟
1/2 second calculation.. "Eehh.. No. No, won't waste your time. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah, take the offer."   Hugs like he finally got one of his pals to believe in his idea Walks off with swagger... "Cheers guys!" 😂🙌🔥
Do u wana think about it lol he's probably thinking about tea time he didn't even counter lol what a guy. Sounds good lol
It looks like a compass in a pencil with a protractor
Probably sell 1 every 6 months lol
What a guy. Got to live the North! No nonsense, he knows the score. Job done
That shouty woman yeuch
I love Sara. She can see potential in almost anyone and she talks so passionately. I think she is the kindest dragon there and she brings such a good atmosphere to the table.
I'm not surprised he's relaxed and confident he's got the coke sniffles
"Howay pet, if I can show ye that this tool fits arroond your ankles, would you accept jus 20% of tha business?"
realy like easy going people
I feel like you HAVE to negotiate SOMETHING
hahaha that was a bloody breath of fresh air! No bullshit, lovely down to earth honest young man! Go  well!
This was incredible, so funny too
This guy is awesome
8:04 Pizza Jones
Ow
European Shark Tanks is horrible
CHAD.
He's not an entrepreneur, he's an inventor
"there's a lot of skill that you lack to get this to market"  "Agreed"  What a stand up chap
This is the sort of straight down the line, no BS person you want to deal with.
He’s wrong electricians could use this to run EMT
The tension at 11:50 only for that ending is both amusing and slightly infuriating.
That would sell thousands in wilko or any shop on the highstreet, its not a bad invention and is usful they would fly off the shelves
-I will make you an offer: i will pay 1$ for 100% of the company -Yeah, it sounds right, deal
The Dragons can be such idiots sometimes. I doubt any of them have ever done any manual labour, let alone cutting bricks or tiles around posts. This invention is brilliant and would save time and money for any tradesperson or regular Joe doing some DIY.
What am I missing, I have seen many tools like this around for several decades, it's only a slightly altered version and cheap plastic. I'm not knocking him, it's fairly clever but it's not extremely revolutionary either.  I think he would have done way better making it out of slim metal instead. This is something to go into tool boxes and the market isn't that huge, any decent craftsman is going to spend a buck more for durability over possibly having to keep repurchasing something many times over.
Yep haha that’s the deal done lol they didn’t realise
The coolest guy ever. No gimmicks, no bs, no sentimentality, just straight forward facts. Brilliant.
Would have been nice to see the presentation FFS
I was like "some bullshit bout to be pitched" but I'm genuinely shocked the dragons didn't have a bidding war over this guy, what a legend
Their is stuff like this already
Why are they the dragons? They’re talking retails like they go to retails? Where are the secretaries and the market advisors? There are reasons why these jobs exist!
Been a mason for 2 years now, could have used this tool multiple times now
I love people like him and Sara is also a good fit because she’s from a similar sort of background and is also a no nonsense northerner. She’s the best person to explain things to him and push things forward, she also gave a very fair offer. Im not surprised that the company is worth over a million now. Good for them 👏🏾
CHAD
Lol I love the offer acceptance at the end. Lad.
‘ i am not sending you to negotiate with our business deals ‘ lol. He can do presentations but heck not in negotiations. Lol
Corporate Ceos:  “For the bri’ish let’s think merlin…erm DRAGONS DEN”  “For the americans let’s think billionaire villain…uhhh SHARK TANK”
He’s either got a cold, hay fever or a Columbian confidant cold
''I can do all the stuff to bring your product to market, I can even produce it for you in one of my own companies'' ''........yep''
I love the guy
This guy is my hero.
Theo perfetus 🤣🤣🤣
Jenny is not there, I guess she is out
Don't mind these investors, they believed because they're successful, they knows it all
The trouble with this product is that any non-tradesperson is only going to need to use this once every five to ten years, and can get by with a pencil and paper. So, it's useful but only to tradespeople, which is a dramatically smaller market. You'd sell hundreds at best.
Proper yorkshireman
I like this guy, proper stand up don.
DIY item are suck no quality at all ..
I’ve been watching shark tank and got into shark tank aus but I found dragon’s den to be too slow and too boring.  The announcer is literally saying everything right before the dragon’s themselves say it
Finally someone 😂😂
Legend
Such a lovely guy. Great character
Bit of a dally-wainker, innit? Cup o tea, crumpet
6:51 millionaires are so out of touch with the working class. Good on him hope it works out 👍
Anybody knows how this tool has done in the market so far?
There's  always an Indian.
What a legend this guy is 😊
This product has alr been used in china quite awhile ago lol.. seen then in tiktok
I love how he just walks out straight after the deal, no messing around at all, he's done what he came to do now he's audi
One problem.... where's me money!!
I genuinely will buy this tool. It’s a little niche, but when you need it and need it done properly this would come in handy
Brilliant! 100% North-western gentleman 🙌
Every tradesperson needs one ? what would a painter need with one ? what would a roof insulation tradesperson need with one of them ? or a gardener or electronics technician or a computer network IT tradesperson or a carpet installer tradesperson ? a car mechanic or diesel mechanic or computer repair technician ? etc etc. I could think of a few more, but he said every trades person. Every tradesperson would need one ?  seriously ?
Nailed it simply good for him
No shot this a bootleg shark tank lmao
The Chinese will have taken that design and had it on the market before the show even ended. No patents apply to them.
I have a question..... Why are the British people so freaking weird
Kevin would had made a licensing deal
I mean, there is other products like this.
What a chill guy 😂
Glad he got an offer
What a Brilliant bloke, and I bet these 2 made a great partnership.
Straight talking man with an idea there the best
Looks like a traveler
Debbie meaden has great legs didn't notice pitch 😂
duh heck is this Shark Tank knockoff??!
One of the most honest people ever..
They speak the same language so no biggie.
Match made in D.I.Y heaven
Great seen a thing to make life easier and the Chinese will copy it 99% cheaper,sad.
85% of nothing or 70% of a successful business. No brainer
This is a fantastic product ❗️
What a nice young man.
All he’s thinking about right now is 💰
5:39 6:42 7:15
ye
This was nearly charming in the simple honesty of it all....
Trades men are very interested in their tools. It's one of the best products I've seen.
Very down to earth guy who I hope makes it big
I really like him. He is such a genuine guy! I’m so happy he got an offer 😁
A genuinely good guy
He’s very smart, the less words you use the better. Concision. Also shows he’s confident in himself and the product, he doesn’t need to use extra words to persuade anyone of anything.
Smart guy!
I love dragons den it’s my favourite show. Peter needs to take a shovel to the head though
The market is the people who need it or want it. A professional would use that to make a job that easy, time is money in the industry. His mistake was saying it was only for DIY.
It was a cert if any of the dragons would back this, it was Zara Davies. The story is so similar to her rise to stardom. She developed a plastic tool for making craft envelopes and the rest is history. She owns an injection moulding company? Perfect. I hope the bjg lad does well from it but Im sure Zara will give it 100%
I need this, where do I buy it?
I own one of these and it's brilliant, all be it I don't use it day in day out in my work but when I do, it gets the job done no problems!
if that was cnc metal a lot of trades would jump on it but plastic it wont last a week. great idea though and a top bloke.
Why did he have a pen balanced behind his ear, given he used a marker pen to mark the tiles. He's making fools of us all......
That dragon who said her husband's a diy guy is smart. She obviously discouraged the others and then came in to get the deal. Heheheh
This is ingenuity. Good innovation to solve a real problem. He's not interested to fake it, he's honest about the product and his expectations. Cool guy
What he needs to do is add a bit of draft to the part, injection mold it, and sell it for a quarter of the price.  (edit: Oh.  I finished the video now.)
Funny note to explore, companies may have more demand for a better tool.. DIY usually just make do with what they got
So glad Sara made the offer
It's not just the money for 30%, it's the money, expertise, market access, and basicslly cost price access to an injection moulding company.  It's a cheap risk for her for only £41k which is probably nothing, and she knows she can easily make that back in the US market where even useless tat can make a fortune (eg the crap people buy on TV shopping or huge dept stores)
The man’s a millionaire now. Fair play.
He damn sure earned this investment! It amazes me to see how little ideas become bigger and better with a helping hand !
What an absolute legend. Wish him all the best.
My grandpa and dad own a orchard and would absolutely love this for the piping to the sprinklers, I gotta show them this
This guy has a perfect business sentiment.
i'd buy it
Love both of them
He's just thinking: "Stop with the dramatic pregnant pauses every 10 seconds"
Am always happy when hardworking people like him gets an offer.
His reaction at the end made me laugh out loud!
Not many men can say they went on dragons den and got there tool out looking for an investment 😄
That’s 13:05 minutes of my life I will never get back!!
I know that is a great & useful tools.
41k? If you truly believe in the product, get the 41k yourself! It’s not a big number? Bank, family members, friends!
Well done Sara! Excellent product!
The interesting pattern I can see in this show...He came with a easy attitude and clinched a deal with a simple, useful, neat product....but many other people had a quite complex product, marketing numbers, and so on...never got a deal. Keep it Simple that's it.
He could've easily got that down to 25% lmao
Money doesn't bring good looks.
I like his cool!
Jenny called up on this episode and said "I'm out"
Sarah Davies is the best!!
Sara: I'll make you an offer. Tiernan: *Angry face.
I want this product!
Nice, straight forward, knows his product. Top bloke!
Alright. Yep
SARA is the real dragon!!!
Lots of tradesmen would find this tool useful.  Give it a go it’s worth trying to get it out there. Way to go !!! Good luck 🤞
'tiernan' no thanks mate
I wish I had that kind of calm in my life.
Best belly laugh ever , cracked me up !!
It’s not just tiles though- this would work on Paving slabs,decking etc etc
I'm not even a tradesman but i can be ocd with cuts and lines and seeing squares around circles annoys me so I'd use it
Yep!
Can't beat a northern man.
I don’t get how they can’t see the potential of this product. They clearly have never even put together flat pack furniture
Sarah can tool the item for less. Great offer. He's smart.
I think this is really good and useful. And in market, in hardware stores, I think it will sell. Deborah could bundle this with some of her other products, Incorporate it.
The final hurdle and he's off a happy chappie! What a pitch. Good luck to him.
heh what a legend , great attitude
Why 41k? Why not 40 or 50? because that's a no bullshit honest guy for you
I have to say that’s the Best ever Dragons Den. He was super chilled out, so matter of fact. Loved it 😎 nice one good luck
This is going to be a great pub story
Ok Theo good to see ye 😂 love it most people act like something they’re not as would say oh hello Theo it’s an honour to meet u when they don’t know nothing about them 👍
I wish him the best of success. We need more ppl like him in the world! Honest.
I Love that mans pitch well done 👌
no one gonna mention the host said "entrep preneur?"
Oh no, why didn`t he say, I`ll meet you halfway?
Nothing at all like your product isn't a great thing. You want things like it to compare, to see how they do and also why is there not? Is it actually needed? However for there to be a product or s out there similar but to be inferior to your product, including cost. That's pretty perfect.
This fella makes me proud to be a Manc hahaha
You can tell hes a really nice bloke. Wish you all the best 👍
What a lad!
Such a likeable person
Was afraid he would get denied because these investors don't specialized in identifying good inventions but analysing sales ... He has no sales but this is a great product ... He will do great
That is the funniest I have ever seen!
Brilliant. How did they both get on and was it a big success?
Take the 30% say you have 15% and you sell 100 put it to 30% and so over 1 million damn  It’s a good deal dude and it’s your only offer take it
I love the product as a builder but love this man more what a guy what a gentle, kind, calm and honest man!! Great to see him walk away with an investment for his business and I hope his doing well.
No I won't waste your time, it sounds good. 😂
I love having people like this in my life, straight talking & focused, absolute salt of the Earth IMHO
From wish?? 😂 £2.49 each
I've often wondered about the dragons thinking. Trunkies being the obvious one but there was another guy with wireless computer controlled light show and the dragons said they didn't see a market. I'm screaming every concert, theatre, indoor outdoor events weddings. No huge wiring to worry about. They all said no.
This guy is brilliant .
Bro just give him the 40k, they’re multi millionaires. 40k is nothing to them, and to him it’s an opportunity.
Do they invest in any pitch?
He didn’t demonstrate it very well. Instead of having thick tiles and showing us one he prepared earlier, he should have had thin tiles even pretend tiles just anything that he could have performed the stunt right before their very eyes. I was in no way convinced. For all we know he could have drilled the hole first put the tile down THEN fix the pipe in the hole guaranteeing a perfect fit we don’t know. He didn’t demonstrate the product at all and if it’s as quick as he is claiming he had the time for it.
Gotta love Debra for giving the usual advice. She has a really good point. Brands buy 1, 2, 3 etc meters in diy stores to display all their tools. They have entire departments and photographers to design it. (Worked at 1). So a single product is REALLY hard to sell.  His reaction at the end..... brilliant!
Deborah talks so much just to say she's out
I just love the way he gives his presentation..
This as the final product is... well no polished he is thinking of selling "sized parts" as addons instead of designing a "moldable" part that would fix itself arround the tube no matter the size of it This would make the product a lot more versatil and popular but well... ok  He made it out of metal? I couldnt clearly see or understand it. Anyway why not plastic? It looked like it cost too much to be made out of plastic / then make a version made out of alluminun that costs more if the products sells well  ps: He didnt have a patent... that is probally what put most dragons off because it is too easy to make a pirated/chinese version of it that would sell a lot cheaper  ps2: I really have the impression of seeing this kind of thing before it just did not have the tube fiting piece
He really did well and got a great dragon. Fair play to him 👍
Tradesmen put up with doing things the harder way because no one has invented an easier way
I'd have offered the money and a burger for 30% but as he'd been wiping his nose for most of his pitch, I wouldn't shake hands on the deal.
I work on tiles, where do I buy one asap!! Those dragons have no clue!!
Lack of knowledge from both the dragons and the presenter. My goodness... do people use a ruler and pencil? How do you think construction is done? Have these people done anything around their homes? Sheetrock, tiles, plywood, siding, etc... this invention is simple and effective. I'm literally going to buy this as soon as I'm done watching this video.
Good lad
Old Debbie’s Hot
This is a great idea. More accurate of cutting
i think this is great and should make one to measure where light sockets and switches go
I was really rooting for this guy I'm really glad he was given that opportunity. He's from the same city and the same country that I'm from.
What a great guy!
G'wan Sarah!!!!
Sadly this is not a unique product. I bought one of these on amazon 2 years ago... When I watched this it was 5 months old
I am disappointed that he did not pull up a stool, sat on it with a pint and sig in hand and pitched his pitch ...
he's not laid back, he's confident. BIG Difference.
I used to live in China some 12 years ago and I’ve seen very similar to this.
I could see these being sold in hardware stores around the globe.
£40,000 for the business and a grand to go to Magaluf with the lads
Legend. My favourite acceptance of a deal ever.
Jenny: I'm not in the den but I'm out.
Looks like a good product. I could see it used for all manner of projects. Depending on how big it can be I'm sure it can go from diy to industrial fairly easy
He is a great person that every body will love
can yall stop panning onto this old hags nails jesus christ its making me uncomfortable
I'm glad he didn't succumb to grovelling, which the viewership of the show, and the producers, and the dragons may've expected.
If the guy was an incredibly cerebral 200 IQ person, he would left with negative money and everyone hating them. This guy was so humble. He knew that she was the best he could get and wasn’t greedy.  I’m saving this video as a reminder. Honesty and Integrity. This man has it and is an effective communicator. Most fast talking sharp looking knuckleheads think they charm their way and you could see she just instantly trusted him because we wasn’t trying to be a showman.
Seems like a decent tool that could be effectively used in many situations. It's cheaper than laser pointer.
You could cut tiles with this invention. You just have to use a stronger blade.
Well done big man
Really enjoyed this.
How old is this video because those things already out on the market for a couple years 😂
I think it's a great product. VERY niche but surely VERY useful for the right person
My favourite DD pitch ... The guy was awesome.  Lost count of the number of times I've watched this now 🙃
That was a good one.
3D print that for a fraction of that cost 😅
Dude this is a game changing product and the dragons have no idea because of how truly separated from hard work they are
When you pitch something to a group of people that don’t have a clue about what you’re pitching.
Well.... you Dont need a special tool for such pipe measure.
feel bad Chinese already have knockoff and its cheaper on amazon
Ahh I love this guy!
She's the wolf, SHES THE WOLF! She knew what to do to get no competition. However I do agree, you probably want to sell the product in a range for more flexibility. Which he probably is planning on doing
How tf did they manage to make another shark tank style show, too many of these shows exist
that one lady who give him the offer looked like a dollar store Adele
I love his honesty.
The dragons are right. The market is questionable at best. I'm sure the lady dragon will make this work, tweak this a little for other tasks and bring it to market.
Nothing at all..  I own three.
Is that just a ticking stick? Kinda?
I'd love one of them to take on my idea.of how I can  save theo ,mr p,thousands,..due to losses in his retail stores.,
This is absolutely for DIY in the American market. I know so many guys who do their own tiling who would love to have this and so many other guys who would buy one just to have in their tool collection.
Sarah Davis is awesome
Top lad 💯
Now if this guy didn't snort a line to calm the nerves before this
My tiling is done, but if l came across it in the store l'd probably pick it up for 'next time'.  My workman would've LOVED it!
When he says yep ? What does that mean ? I don’t speak Australian
That is a good deal. If she threw money and wanted 30%, no, but she is adding marketing and production. Yeah, well worth it.
Could you not just use a piece of paper or a bit of string to and save money
The sharks usually want 51 percent..  Haaa This is a product that the one time diy that has little skill would buy. To many extra pieces for a pro to keep track of.
I'm a contractor and I'd add thos to my packout 100%
What a fella! You gotta just love that "meeeh"- attitude. And so far, 30 K+ liking this video and not a single thumbs down. Must be a first in Youtube- history.
Problem with these products is china just copies it and mass produces it
3d printers
Sounds like a good invention, but I wonder how he is doing now and how this invention is doing now.
Theo, is a langer.
This guy is epic
These "dragons" honestly seem extremely unintelligent, and have likely never worked or earned anything in their lives.
These millionaires are good at spotting scams, but they also have the habit to turn down quite profitable ideas.  This product is great for one time pipe repair/reform kits.
I've worked as a tiler and I wouldn't use something like this if I got it free.. Not saying its not good at what it does, cause it probably is, but I'd bet I can do it quicker (and good enough) with the ruler in my pocket without the hazzle of finding the right size template and setting up this tool.. For diy'ers who doesn't know how to measure and mark a hole or a edge with a ruler this might be useful, and I absolutely think the market for diy tools like this is a lot bigger than the millionaire who hires people to change lightbulbs thinks...
Can I buy this? Seriously, I'm working on renovating my bathroom and this would help immensely!
He went in there offering 50% and they misheard him. They offered him 20% lower equity stake in the company and increased his evaluation of the business.  Now he’s off for a drink at the pub to tell his buddies how much these wankers just loved his product. They won’t believe him, and life goes on.
Fantastic, I hope it will work on short and long term
A million more of that guy and the world would be a better place
She really is a smug ***t
Should put English subtitles on
literally just a normal guy
When mom says “we have shark tank at home”
Johnny Vegas voice
I'm an avid DIY enthusiast and tool collector I would happily spend anything up to £50 on this product and add it to my tool box, full of tools I've never used and call out a proper tiler or carpenter when I bollocks the job up.............
DIY? how many holes does he think a person need to drill for justify  buying that thingy ? I think it's more for the plumbers etc. and they have much better equipment than that plastic junk 😂😂😂👎👎👎
Looks quite ingenious.
I mean, yeah she wanted twice of what he was offering, but he still gets 70%. That's not bad.
Dragons, major multi-millionaires with deep connections to sell almost anything. Too stingy too give a guy 40k for a well designed product that will surely pay for itself.  MrBeast, just gives away 40k to a stranger.
This not-Deborah female says her father/husband is a DiY er and tgey don't have the tools to drill a hole in tiles at home? What? Does she think hammering a nail into the wall or changing a light bulb is DIY? What DIYer has no tools to drill holes?
In Texas we call him a straight-shooter. Straight to the point and no BS-ing.
Good dude
I have now watched the end when he accepted about 10 times and i laughed each time. That was great!
Was that a moth or other bug running up the wall after the camera shot from out of the room? What was that?
Isn't this problem solved with a simple math equation and a regular tape measure? ...
He is smart he didn't see only the money she gave him. He also got her experience and it seems it paid off for him
Isnt this the British version of shark tank
This comment section is full of mongs who think they know things
I get his attitude. I make low carb grain free cakes that have the texture of regular cakes. I diverge paths in that I would buy my product but I can't be bothered selling it.
Can't you just draw the outline of a pipe by placing the pipe on a surface you want to cut it out from!?
It will be good for tiling, floor fitting and kitchen fitting. If i would be doing first two for a living and only that, then definitelly would buy that tool. Meanwile, tape and a pencil...) Could create heads for sockets and switches for that, maybe extractor fan, something like that and bundle up
First guy I saw with hands in his pockets in the den, haha.
This type of product has beem around for years. Except qith a netter design and  cheaper
12:11 vultures clapping. 🤭🤨
A refreshing episode of straight talking from a straight guy and good luck to him.
This is one of those videos that you REALLY need to watch all the way to the end to fully appreciate
Decent man.  Wish him all the best
Anybody else’s getting the vibe this guy might have done at least a little bit of coke before this pitch? 😂
What a load of BS. My grandfather had these types of things in Africa in the 80's/90's. We used to make this tool as part of our technical schooling. It's basic tiling tooling templates. I think this will probably be best sold as a 3d printed design. 2 pounds for the print model etc...  This just isn't something I would pay 20 pounds for.
I'd buy
What’s funny is I think he took the offer with the first ‘yup’ but no one caught on that’s why it just looked like a staring contest for a few seconds 😭😭😭
I'd buy that, it would defentialy make things easier for a few projects i need to complete off the top of my head.
Bet you I'd he goes to a company like Milwaukee, craftsman, etc they would buy the patent straight off him or invest immediately
Honestly, 30% equity seems incredibly generous considering that basically the only value he's providing is the intellectual property itself. That's not to knock the guy, but he practically admits he has zero business acumen. If I was a dragon here, I would make a buyout offer or no offer at all, because it's pretty clear you're going to be doing 100% of the work.
I install closets and cabinets professionally. For grommets for like wire management could be useful but I mean.  Yea sure I'd try it out.
Pipe easy Dragon: can you show me how it works
What a dingus, I am an electrician...I surface mount pipes in commercial space. I could use something like that... But since you said we don't need it...I guess I'll stick to my tape measure.
Typical down to earth, no bullshit, straight talking northern lad 💪🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Can't stop watching this absolute gent
These guys are kinda idiots sometimes, this tool is cheap and provides fast and perfectly adequate layout. It can be scaled for all sorts of operations on tile alone. If you're going to tile your own bathroom you can pick one of these up on your way out of the hardware store with the grout or w/e and make your job so much easier.
Jesus man atleast bounce back with 25 at least!!!! looool
I would sell the patent and walk
These people are still stuck in retail? give it to a YouTube surfacing guy and let him review it, it will sell like crazy.
Honestly I'd chose this any day over the faffing around with a ruler and pencil. Work smarter n faster
There's not a product EXACTLY like it, but many close.
That’s a British northerner for ya.  Straight talking , no nonsense.  Crack on and get it done.  The only person in the room without a ball of stress inside him . The man is a masterclass of how to get it done.   Well done sir.  Hope you make a billion quid .
Jeez, what a bunch of smug w@nkers. Good luck fella.
Love this one!
I just want that hug at the end
As a tradesman plumber. This is an awsome tool
There is much much easy way to do what this product do. 🙄🤷
His demonstration, made the process of using that thing, as clear as mud.
his name is tenner macock?
These tools make a ton but mostly with tiles.
Seen these on YouTube shorts for the past two years.
That chap is way more clever than it seems at first glance. I'm sure he evaluated his chances of bringing his product to the market and concluded that even 30-40% of the company would be worth the help he would get to make it succeed. Presenting 15% and getting a deal on 30% is an awesome opportunity to not have this product fade into the unknown like many other clever inventions and actually become reality. Well done lad.
This is right up my alley. Tiler here. This is indeed extremely useful, however there are somewhat similar products that I have used and what I can say is the plastic ones are very flimsy, especially those clamps to hold it together at a desired setting. All he has to do is upgrade materials and sturdiness and... I am in fact looking to buy one right now.
What is this shark tank off brand show
I'm sure a breakdance routine would make his pitch 10x better.
"Whether people will still use a ruler and a pencil to mark the points where they need to drill the hole?"  WTF else are they gonna use?
I loved this guy. I hope he achieves a lot of success

I'm an Electrician. $20 il buy that for sure.
I wonder if he later laid back with the investor?
I love this guy!
The argument is really whether to be consumer facing or enterprise facing. Enterprise facing can mean a ton more money as well as interesting connections networking and all kinds of odd opportunities. It’s often overlooked by most entrepreneurs in the engineering side of things
I'd defo have one you never know what is going to be in a yard
He’s amazing, seriously. I wish I was as chill, haha!
Is this business still going? Did the investment go through?
Who thought of Kimi Raikonnen after watching this
This is SO refreshing. Well done sir. I hope you go far
I like this guy totally honest and Sara actually gave him a good deal considering, there was nothing to negotiate and he did the right thing accepting.
Man if everyone had this vibe we would never have a war in our world. What a cool lad lol
Tiernan no fks given.
This dude is awesome. No BS. No overconfident "I know the dragons will salivate over me!" Attitude.  Just straight up pitch. Knows he needs help.  Seems he'd be likeable and easy to work with
"Sara Davies looks at Teirnan like he owes her child support.."
Damn this guy is so real no bullshit no greed just busting ass trying to get a business going dont know where he is today hope he has succeeded
Be just as easy to use a contour jig and they cost next to nothing
71
So cool dude I’m really happy for him
Maybe I'm being thick, but how would you get the tile with the hole over the pipe? His demo pipe was cut off at about 50cm high, but surely most pipes are one continuous solid thing, so you couldn't slot the tile over them, you'd need a cut-out that reaches the edge of the tile...
He looks like he is on his way to a darts tournament
Just love him
Hell, I would get one, do they plan to go world wide? Brazil needs this.
As an electrician, I would use this tool!
Wow really makes you wonder how these people are successful. The moron to the far left has 100 hardware stores and doesnt think putting an extremely useful 1 of a kind product like this in them is a good idea? Dude shoulda gone straight to Arthur Blank.
It's called a multi-angle ruler and they've been around for decades: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtlwG58r5UY
Every success video I watch for dragons den keeps telling me the same thing: it's not the sigma male grindset entrepreneurs that come out on top, it's the solid guys with experience just looking to make life a little easier. I get the feeling this guy would be happy just to use the product over sending it out as a business.
Eeh, ah gorrit pen behind it ear!
He needs to be holding a can of beer in one hand
Great product.
Yeaa, no point talking to the wall, wall doesn't say much.. so let's get on with it, ok... I got tiling to do!
Is that icarlys old apartment
He isn’t laid back he just knows what’s what, he knows that his product is good and has actual use and that they would be dumb not to at least make an offer
Does that mean he keeps 70% whilst she takes 30%??
Legend
When he said, "Every traidsman, bar electrictians" - Meaning he understood that "everyone" doesn't need it, and really understands who does and WHY and why the people who don't, don't; I would have made him an offer.
Gassed for the guy
I would buy one
they just gonna steal this poor mans idea as soon as the patent defaults . i can see it in their greedy eyes
So laid back I'm surprised the dragons didn't meet him at the pub, walk in and he's sitting there waiting for there pitch.
Eat the rich
Fair play for him trying his best
Polkadot lady is annoying. Asian guy looking like he sniffed 4 ounces in a two days.
Theo has 100 DIY stores ? Which ones ???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The giant burd from Newcastle just oozes class 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and gravey
All those ' millionaires ' look awful.  This show is so tacky and cheap it's sick. Reggae reggae sauce.....that's the most famous thing to ever come out of this.......sell it in pound land........classy stuff. If you want money it's simple just work hard......don't have some tosser who comes from money and doesn't know how to talk to regular  humanity .....these people are mental
Hope this guy made a shi*-ton of money from this.
Peter kays half brother tryna make it. Good lick to him
40K for 30% of that patent seems like a very good deal.
I mean, if I needed to drill exact holes, I'd for sure be looking for something like this. 20$ is a fair price if you need it.
You’ve got to wonder about the dragons and their vision sometimes. They were concerned that it was aimed at DIY people and not tradesmen but I mean seriously Tradesmen and DIY people use a lot of the same tools anyway. Tradesmen might have some more specialist expensive kit like nail guns or something but cheap tools like this are well aimed at DIY people and Tradesmen. I mean at the end of the day a hammer is a hammer regardless, you don’t have to be a carpenter to use one. . And plus a lot of DIY people do their own tiling. Their concern about people not doing it because it’s too hard is invalid because this tool is literally here to make it not hard.
Maybe they would've understood better if he also demonstrated the traditional way people would have to do that, maybe asked them to do it themselves, see firsthand just how frustrating, time-consuming, and error-prone it is. Nothing more frustrating than having to do something twice, particularly cuts like that. Pretty sure just about anyone would see that this is a tool that needs to exist.
I think this could work as long as the tip is modular for different size and angle of approach it can be done well. Problem is, he might lost business to cheap Chinese copy. I know a lot of tools like this that get sold for cheap. If its built well and charge a little more then handy man would be willing to pay the extra price just for durability.
Top stuff this guy
Hard working, socially awkward and honest. I hope its doing well.
I'm still unsure how it works and when he marked the hole and pulled it away, the mark he just did wasn't there. I like it though and I'm sure it would sell.
I would've made an offer but for 45% of the business not 30%.
This old right?  I mean who whould give away a percentage of a company 2021:) You just call a guy in china and let them produce it.  Then contact a marketing team.  Done..
My first thought when he demonstrated it was "dang i could use that, and for that price? I'm sold"
does this already exist but is a lill differnt but exatly the same product lol
I wish I had this product. The contractors that even do insurance jobs did such a terrible job is actually shocking. This is would be ideal.
Why'd you do it
As a construction foreman ,I can say this is a genius invention, They dont know what they are so dramatically saying no to.
What is the name of this buisness now I want to see how much it costs in £
My husband is quite DIY but do you think someone would have all that stuff to drill a hole? You mean a power drill?  Her husband probably hung a painting and calls himself a handyman
Dragons try to put pressure and make the show more dramatic but the guy is just chill.
Looks like a good product, I think my dad would buy something like like this, he does all the DIY jobs going. if I was him though, i woulda knocked her down to 25% as thats close but 5% could be quite a bit in the long run.
Love tianan
This looks a lot like shark tank... This must be British right? Was this before or after shark tank? I'm just curious, thank you!
“No, nope don’t wanna waste your time. Yeah I’ll take the offer” so nonchalant
Being a DIY myself I would use that for sure, bring it to 🇦🇺 I hate trying to accurately make holes if this makes it easier I say bring it.
It's not a bad deal she's literally gonna do all the work producing, and getting to market. He thought he would have to do the injection molds bit she can do it much cheaper making more profit.
I know multiple people that have done their own tiling lol
I just cut some pipes by eyeballing and using a framing square... Came out a 1/4" off, which is why I just went with 30% larger holes.  This thing would have my work looking slick
Was the product successful?
What a legend! Lol
you are in the wrong country. in America DIY ers buy this kind if stuff all the time. I have atleast 20 or more tools that I have bought, each with one purpose.
Man shark tank really went down hill
With diy van life and revelation I know several companies that would buy these
If she can produce the tool for him, it takes off a load of money needed from the 41K to develop factory processes. The profit margin is higher for her, and he can use the money for promotion instead of molds,therefore making more money on the long term without even thinking about production. Basically, a very good deal.
Haha 😂 gold
It’s all about profit maximization or to put it simply   How much bang can I get out of a product and how many different types of products can I make to fit different markets, which is why Swiss Army knives are so popular is because they have everything on a small platform
Why'd you do it
Perhaps an option for magnetic clamps to hold it in place
Personally I would make the ends more modular so it can do other sizes of pipes
This is a good tool. The pros use geometrical tricks where they mark in steps, but this simplifies and does most if the work for the user.
I’m a tiler and I want this so bloody handy
that's a real man. no bullshit, expert in his own trade, honest and strong enough to save the day if any drama happen around him.
People in England may not do their own work but a large majority of Americans do.He could have a market here
So many trades could use this tool tiling, masonry, carpentry, plumbing,roofing you name it and it would make for much neater finishes
Wow, what an awesome guy! He did great!
Damn he's shaking so much but he fully does the presentation amazingly
Ma sha Allah
Ma sha Allah
LOL STOP ZOOMING IN  ON EVERYONES FACES XD
This guy is amazing
Good guy, not hiding anything. That's why he's calm, cause he's honest.
That hug at the end was awkward.
I only clicked on this cause wtf is dragons den
I have DIY tiled 4 houses thus far and have never worked as a contractor. I would love a tool like this as it doesn't just apply to tile.
How working with a cut pipe work...  pipe size ect
He's like Karl Pilkington.  "Won't waste ye time"... brilliant.
This is something that, honestly, should've existed 500 years ago.  Bravo, dude...
Sell it in the US because she knows we’ll buy anything. 😂
Top bloke!
Damn, wish this product was up for dropshipping, this is one of these products that is quiet satisfying to watch in action, and that everybody buys but never uses, I could dropship this and scale it, I’m quiet confident in that 😂
“The key to trading success is emotional discipline. If intelligence were the key, there would be a lot more people making money trading… I know this will sound like a cliche, but the single most important reason that people lose money in the financial markets is that they don’t cut their losses short.”
He loaded up on Xanax.
"So it's a ruler?" Ehh no a surface measuring device... *facepalm*... It's a simple plastic ruler with a locator at the end that could be made in China for 12 cents and sold for 5 bucks.
He's a good guy that's all I'll say
Ethereum 💰
He needs a hanky!😂😂
11:48, thought theres a fly on my phone lol
I don’t have a need for one now but if I did I would buy one. I know the job it does and that would make it far easier to do.
"yep"
He looks like he literally just came on his break from working to pitch it and is just going right back to work. lol Hard not to respect the guy!
Bunch of rich F who want take your money
I'm about to buy the hell out of this. Every household will have one by the end of it I bet. Why hadn't anyone else made this before!
Shows that none of them have done tiling in their lives. Getting around pipes are a pain in the ass. There are tools similar to this but still it's going to be a huge market for anyone who has to get that measurement when it's impeded by a rogue pipe or a random support.
Only one the actually made sense was thecold lady
I thought for a second Pipe Easy was a male escort service ;) ;)
Sara Davis first: "this is not DIY" (impling the market is small) All other dragons jump out Sara Davis then: "this is for tradesman and DIY. The market potential is huge, this is insanely good." All other dragons are asking them self what just happened 🤣
"Guys, make sure that when you tell him NO, it REEEALLY gets to him!"  "Yeah sure, whateva. Thanks for the valuable opinion, top class. Cheers"
The 4 buffoons lost a good opportunity. Sure people can use a ruler and a pen, but the precision this offers... how could they been so blind. When I saw it, I immediately wanted one, even though I have no use for it now, that's how useful it is. Better to have it laying around for a year or two, than to need it and not have it.
These rich snobs are so out of touch and self-important
this was hilarious
dragons pen
the dollar store shark tank
What a fuckin boss this lad is
The big blonde is cringe.  "I know becasue my husband is good at DIY"
Champion this guy 👍
Fck it, I’ll take it 😂
I have one, really handy tool to have!!
Nick frost has done away from killing zombies and delved into starting his own company
Just a normal pitch, lol
I hate Theo
They are so up themselves i cant stand watching this, the guy designed a good product they are all just scared to invest unless it 100% is gonna give them money back instantly
such a weird and grim building to be in
Good invention not investable what a load of crap
Never ever accept the first offer
Little did they know, he planned to 50%-50% it, with hopes of return because he didn't know how to enter the market, so he threw a low price on a slice of pie. She thought she had a steal, but she could've gotten more.
Only one person, but I'm buying one for my father in law.
Is this European “Shark Tank”!?? Wtf
Blue collar guy selling a blue collar idea to white collar people
"Mom can we watch shark tank at home?" "We have shark tank at home." Shark tank at home:
Strong David Brent vibes at 11:33
Shark tank but bad
Its a good product, ive worked with mounting plasterboards on walls and its a pain in the ass to get the holes perferct, very difficult, even people with more experience in it missed many times.
This guy is a legend He somehow stumbled into the den and got an investment
"Hi Teirnan, I'm Theo." "Okay."  Amazing.
He just walked off.. Lovely man
Why don't you tell us what you really think Teirnan;)  Love it!
This guy seems cool, he’s pretty no nonsense and knows what he wants
I don't think this would be super successful. How many pipe cutters are really out there? A few thousand?
This is actually amazing. I do all types of hard-surface flooring, and this would be incredibly useful on almost every job. Brb, gotta go buy one
Should have negotiated the percentages
I hate what the world is coming to
"We get the pros in to do our tiles"  Obv no concept of the fact there are people who cant afford the luxury and have to do it themselves.
gotta love how they all slam the products "marketability" based off the fact they're all rich and can just pay someone to do the work, and how his product didn't already have a line of other things to go with it EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED VERY COMPACT AND EASILY USED WITH OTHER TOOLS YOU ALREADY HAVE
This show’s pace is so grueling slow compared to the US version “shark tank”.
He could have gotten her at 25 percent.
I hate the dungeon aesthetic of this show.
F*** this rip off show lol
He said it’s aimed for DIYers, but they seem to be taking that at face value. Just because he said it’s aimed at DIYers doesn’t mean it would be exclusive to them. Tradespeople would definitely use something this not just people doing DIY.
This bloke owns 100 hardware stores and he didn't speak up once before rejecting the idea?  I know the show is meant to be entertainment and a little false but that was strange.
im with the dragons its a great product its a useful product but its a little niche and many might just do it the harder way rather than buy a tool. he will make a lot of money (and probably has if you look it up idk) but its not enough on its own to be like the next big thing.
I've seen lots of tools like this. Even better ones fit cutting perfect tiles.
“We get tiler’s to do our tiling” well, that’s because you don’t have a product that makes it easy for you to do the difficult tasks, like the one you’re holding in your hand. Give people a way to do things without needing to know the math behind accomplishing the task, and you just created a product that gives them the reason to do it on their own.
She was waiting for him to say, "Can we make it 20%"? Then she could say 25%... He left hundreds of thousands on the table
Money, money, money
I wanted to see him turn over and show his plumbers crack
Think I'm gonna order one
"Okay theo nice to see ya" Legend
One of the most succesful products ever
Electricians run pipe too. So every tradesman.
they're tryna be all dramatic as they turn him down, and hes like "ok, yeah."  haha i love it.
He went right back to the pub after this.
‘Like and follow for more flooring videos!’
It looks like a solution waiting for other problems.  Yes, it works for the small market of making holes in slabs and tiles, but there could be uses in anything from welding to painting.  "Dave, go grab the green thing from the van, I've got an idea" could be a common theme.  Good luck with it!
I would absolutely buy one of those
if he would have taken it to China could manufacture them for like $2 per piece and sell it for 20 quid on the UK market
Why do you all brits look like this lmao
A good product speaks for itself.
I would buy it..
I would buy it..
can i pitch my idea here there is a big homelessness problem and i believe i have a fix for the worldwide problem we face nationwide.  my grammar is terrible there is a gap between the homeless shelters eg sleep Sleep safe Selby Registered charity no 1189035 , the food banks and the rehab centre's and the council think if they all worked at the homeless shelter as dayshift, nightshift staff. as there is no community i think it would bring small towns and city's together as well as helping people I've lived here when i was made homeless and it helped me work then get my own place i have experienced horrible living standards and i think this could be improved from shared house to affordable housing i want to break the line between celebrity and YouTube creator
Dragons Den? Is this like the walmart brand for Shark Tank?
Ok, yah
Fair play to him.
This is the most useless narration ever. I don’t need to be told what the next questions will be. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Sort of frustrating that she tells him it's not for diy people cause everyone just pays a tradesman to do that kind of work for them. Yeah I'm sure a millionaire doesn't have a problem with that but lots of people would rather get some tools and do the work themselves at least where I'm from. Just kinda silly I guess cause you can tell he didn't account for the disconnect between normal people who do their house work and the rich millionaire investors he's pitching to
This dudes a legend
Seeing this show is like looking into an alternate timeline. This is no where as cool as being a shark.
They’re doing dragons now? Lol
pretty sure he did not invent this - seen it before I am afraid
Is he a Pilkington?
Good old northerners
Expert Mrs Allen Lisa is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy?
I would have taken that offer too.
Why didn't theo just say he was out, instead he strung it out as a cliffhanger...  Ive never liked that wee tit!!!
"All tradesmen bar electricians" clearly he has never herd of electrical conduit(pipe)
What a bunch of sharks
7:00 way to go guy, bring up his hopes just to smash them with a hammer
THE MOST QUIET AGREEMENT EVER
we have this show in denmark except its called lion's den
😴😴😴
These peppers aren't dragons. They are snakes who see way more potential than they are letting on. Basically they are trying to steal his idea.
Yer, I liked his presentation and wish him all the best.
Dang, imo he actually got a really good offer there, considering she took his idea, destroyed the notion of needing outside contractors to produce, and took on all the costs of that herself. I'd have honestly expected her to take no less than 50% with this considered.
Ahaha the “Dragons Den” sounds oddly familiar 🦈
what a lad
this is a great tool and 2/3 investors here who sell diy products can't see that.... wtf
The woman was actually asking for 20 or 25% not 30. She expected a negotiation but dude left at least 5% of his business on the table.
So this like the international version of Shark Tank?
The fact they think pencils aren’t used on sites just says everything we need to know
In general, I could see this having wide application across all product creation. Woodwork, metalwork, upholstery, not just home DIY.
Now this man did his homework. I aspire to be as planned and calculated as this man.
Her laughing at the end! She's like "OMG guys, did you just see that, he didn't even *try* to negotiate". She clearly feels like she got a great deal! And him too!
But, most pipes would be connected, so sliding down a pipe is not an option.
Mans understood the assignment
Respect that hustle on her.
None of these people have ever seen any construction workers whom of which are exactly like this guy
If the dragons had any tradesman experience they would immediately jump on this. This is why I believe everybody needs to take some sort of shop/ home repair class in high school
Is this like an off brand Shark Tank?
This is an ancient tool called something like a "tic stick"
As a former tradesman and current business owner, these investors don’t know what they are talking about. They focused too much on people not wanting to diy because it’s hard. Yeah, that’s the point of his product. To not make it hard.
If I had the money to invest I’d be putting money into this, more than anything because I have looked for this exact tool.
I️ just clicked on this because I️ wanted to see the offbrand fake shark tank! What the hell is this?!
The blond lady is a shark indeed, slam the product, every1 backs off, then swoop in.. and the bloke seems like a great guy, all the luck to him
Love this man, some people are just so naturally charming.
I love the way that every one of them immediately responds positively to his humility, directness, honesty and respect for the process.
he probably have seen it on Tiktok
I guarantee he celebrated with a couple of steak bakes from Gregg's!! ❤️
Sigma grindset embodied
As a plummer. This is brilliant, i’d 100% buy it! Measuring a radiator pipe to go down into the floor and getting it spot on is difficult Drilling a hole for a condensing pipe through the work tops, getting it spot on is hard These lot wouldn’t understand as they arnt in trade🤷‍♂️
Debra's idea is actually really good. If he can strike deal with another company to bundle his product with theirs; he can make quite a bit of money on it.
The way he was like "alright theo" killed me
McCockle ?! 😂
I wonder if he knows the pens in his ear
As someone who tiled a bathroom and miscalculated the position of the pipe hole on 3 separate tiles (basically ruining them), this is bloody brilliant
He needed to learn some marketing bullshit to get the others onboard. It seems like a great product, i don't get why they didn't want to back him. If there are truly no other products that solve this and the problem is real, the market will be worth millions.
"So this is a ruler yes?"  "No it's a surface measuring tool."  ???
I wouldn't call this laid back. He sounds nervous throughout. He just isn't being cocky or tryna lie about his product.
Salt of the earth
11:35 he agrees to the deal
Yep 😂
this man is unshakeable
There's a product like this in the market already for some years
He's calm cuz he's pretty much scamming these guys. Yes there are tool exactly like this. 😆
Very down to earth straight forward guy, I'd do business with him too.
He’s a legend 😂
I think he was actually quite nervous, he was just forcing himself to play it cool
What a top lad!  If I was living in the UK I would love to have a pint with him lol
I dont build a lot but I cut a few planks with a saw for my grandpa and I had to use like 2 different things to map out a corner that would probably have knocked a few seconds off doing that and it was such a simple thing to do in the first place. that tool would really just hit different for a lot of different things
The strange case of the guy who knows what he doesn’t know and won’t BS to hide it. Love it.
The man just wants to make a good living
Straight up man, no BS. Respect.
His market is wrong. This is for contractors, floorers, carpet and hard. For landscapers and professionals not diy
“My husband pays people to do the tiles in our home” -the millionaire who hasn’t changed a light bulb.
I'll so use this for work.
Wow those supposed dragons seem to be idiots when it comes to diy or professional tradesmen markets.
I am NVQ level 4 setter in Injection Moulding if you want to employ me Sara?
I love how he knows his product is good, maybe isn't the brightest lad, but he knows his field, surfacing and flooring is his deal, he has it down pat, so he just needed a dragon to help the last push with some business acumen.   I love that his company is already worth £1 m.
He’s not laid back, he’s honest.  I respect that.
His voice reminds me of Karl Pilkinton so much which just made this video 10x better
Dragon's den? 🤔🤔🤔
There have been items similar to this for quite some time now
He is what you see , genuine guy
That's the best response to an offer I've heard
Made of plastic it would be broke on the first day. I am a tiler of over 20 years and I always cut around my pipes measuring tape and experience.
The only problem is that any tradesman can see this and make their own
CaPiTaLiSm BrEeDs iNnOvAtIoN
It's a nice tool, I would totally use it. It would definitely be popular in the American market.
Nice to see that Derek Trotter is living out the dream.
I need this could've help alot last week
I would absolutely buy this
The vibe of this show is... Different. I like shark tanks more whimsical take.
I like this guy, he knows he has a good idea and isn’t here to dance in circles for the dragons
2:17 anyone else see the bug run up the screen?
Peter Kay’s been busy
I do wonder about the vision of the dragons sometimes. As a tradesman anything like this that saves time, ensures a perfect job every time and is cheap and easy to throw in the tool box. I would probably buy it.
While it's not a bad product, I think it would be way easier to just use a ruler
Just ordered 1 online
What a cool guy, wish them all the best in the future!
So I’m not gonna lie right at the end when they all clap because of how easy it was for them to make a deal. Then as he’s walking out they laugh about the deal he made. That’s so trashy and these “dragons” run companies and treat their employees the same I imagine
I would have bought this when I was in home renos!! Damn!! So much faster to mark out SO many things!! 😎👍
This guy is the Kimi Räikkönen of Dragons Den
Is this was late night TV, he would have said “yah fook it”
Teirnan seems nice enough but this thing looks like a waste of space! Especially with everyone having access to 3d printers now (either at home or local library)
The dragons who said no are morons
This is the epitome of the uk to me. Guy gets an offer and his first response is "yeah"
That mans pupils are massive. O.O
Can't raise 50K from gofundme?
You can 3D print that for $1 or less... 17 pound???
Love him
As someone that just finished a bathroom, would of LOVED this lol
Karl Pilkington doesn't look how I remember him.
**Person walks in** **Sharks already taking notes**
The best kinds of people are those not impressed by suits, money or flashy, ostentatious language. Straight-talking, honest people are always the ones I trust the most.
Subscribe so you don't miss out on the newest clips from Dragons’ Den! https://www.youtube.com/c/DragonsDenGlobal/?sub_confirmation=1
DIY people attack all size of projects. "It's not a hammer so I can't do it"
The guy didn’t even actually show how to use his product.  If the product doesn’t work well, he’s scamming mighty well
And then straight to the pub
Nope he’s just honest, knows what he wants and doesn’t entertain BS💯
Absolute chad, I hope his product makes it big
Should have asked for 45%
There was about 10 ads on this one video, ridiculous
Wow what a shity concept this show would be better with a different animal mascot? Like a shark that lives in a tank. Honestly shark would be out can't even use this on a cat or dog
Poor rich people
based
My 3d printer how's that patent going. Nice tool tyvm.
He knows what he wants
thought he was going to say, "I already accepted the first time" or something at the end lol
Clearly there are other products like this around cos ive sold a few of them
“The market”
He kinda messed up only talking about tiles, they all focused on tiles but really this is used for literally any type of plumbing work. I’m not even a plumber and I could’ve used this for a couple spots, good thing all the work I’ve done gets covered up after lmao
I feel like he could market that to tradespeopke and hobbyists (not your average DIYer) for 2 or 3 times the price he's currently selling for and not need to immediately get the production price down. Really handy tool. He could sell enough easy, especially with an online store, willing to ship them overseas. I'm a Carpenter in Canada, I don't tike a lot, but I can see myself buying that tool for doing the odd tike job, and also to add to my tool collection 🤓
This is a very good invention
Is this the new shark tank?
Ive done quite a bit of tiling, Id use something like this cuz cutting pipe openings IS a PITA for sure if you are a novice.  If only I had more tile to do…
This would be a great product for licensing.
11:45 what’s that crawling up the wall?
If I was a bit more like this man I would be much happier in life.
ya... but a pipe is continuous. You wouldn't take the tile over a pipe like he did in the demo
Just looked it up and it’s still selling they have directions and everything
And then 2 years later the dot ruler sells hundreds of millions. Oops
This could be produced using a large 3D printer for quite cheap if you buy a printer for like $500. Or just buy a CNC machine that could cut it from a solid sheet of plastic. The screw on parts could be still 3D printed. Basically the investments are useless here because he has no idea if it would sell.
I wouldn't say bar electricians!
yep
Just say no ffs
As someone who builds a lot (professionally) I’d love to have this.
I've seen them in china
I love this guy.  True tradesman sweetheart
Cute little brits trying to be american
"What DIYer is going to have those tools???" Lady, those tools came in the big box of assorted bits I got for a power drill. I think Sara just thinks her husband is better at DIY than he is.
I was rooting for this guy
A man with no bullshit. A lot of common sense. And now an opportunity to change his life. Marvellous. 70% of a lot is a damn sight better than 15% of nothing.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Zara Davies knows fuckall about construction and how many tools could be created to make it easier
i'm an electrician and can actually see that product being useful for when we're using plastic/metal piping
Something about this guy i know he will do good
Good luck Tim 👍
Actually seeing this used in the field and it works like a charm.
Cool dude wouldn't mind having a pint with him
am i the only one who had difficulty understanding them?
A real man
This guy is extremely chilled... Straight to the point, gets the job done and walks the hell out✅
This show is a bootleg shark tank
I like the way this Fella has just come out of the nearest  Cafe after a Full english & doesnt give a toss  😅🤣😂🤣
Is this a joke
i saw that in facebook
I love this guy! "Na won't waste ye time, yep sounds good"
Chad.
I love how honest he is. I think he came to the den too early though. Could have done more market research before the presentation.
His eyebrow is his forehead what do they put in the brits water
Its freaking Forrest Gump
Omg this is genius. Helps to have the center of the pipe measurement. I love the products on dragons.
600 years ago, this was a front like pikeman defending against the french. "Yep. No. Yeah. French cav gonna charge we just hold the line don't waste anybody's time* . 10/10
Been seeing these on tictok for years.... But congrats on his success 😊
If he was business savvy he could've gotten away with 20% - 25%
is this British shark tank
Pretty sure I've seen ths product before like years ago
This is just British shark tank
People like him get shot down in the US (and will continually get shut in the near future) due to MASSIVE generational differences.  Those running most companies and corporations are all very, very old and unknowledgeable when it comes to modern technology.  Young people, however, has been spitting out ways to make things better and more enhanced and precise for years, however, they've constantly been dismissed and ignored.  The younger folks get this information and these ideas from having spent years on the internet, learning more than the older company leaders have by the time they're 20 years old.  But since they're ideas are too good, the older company rulers shut them down as they PERSONALLY want to stay prevalent and highly accepted - and so any better ideas get thrown out the window.  So I'm super glad that this man's intelligent idea was accepted.  And if you check, it blossomed into a successful company.  Kudos!
Knew he was from Manchester right away haha
so laid back his passport photos landscape
Teirnan is a proper British tradesman, sticks to what he knows & no bullshit. Topman & best of luck to him (he's clearly put in the effort to get some luck his way)
So I'm a diy person and I normally don't touch tiles because of the unforgiving nature or stone counter tops for the same reason, let me say take my money, I would feel confident to do do these things with such a good tool, what the guy needs is an excitable friend who's good with words.
The biro over the ear. Nice touch.
straight up lad no messing about ha
Thats a very awesome tool to have, I worked in interior for a long time and you can use this in a lot of things including panels on the walls. The Dragons are not diy or tradesman they dont know how to use this things they probably dont even know how to use a measuring tape. This product is like a T Square why do T square sell?
I have always wonder what they really write on those note books
I'd say he got a good deal out of it. Since he's a one-man project up until that point he still has a sizeable share at 70%, and I bet she'll bring a lot of value with her expertise and manufacturing capabilities.
Great business man. Gets the point across. Is direct and simple in explanation. Let’s the product speak for itself.
He's so confident because this tool is literally in response the normal way you fit pipes. The tool is just a combination of all of the normal steps to locate the drilling location condensed into a single setup, of course it's useful and of course people would want it. The interesting thing is, its not just tradesmen or just DIY. ANYbody fitting tile or really any surface around pipes could pick it up and use it.
man came in and out of the den like a kid picking their nose
I saw his product and was like 'yeah this will sell' looks like from the comments I wasn't wrong
" I'm not sending you in to negotiate our business deals "   You own 30 % he owns 70% he makes the decisions
wtf i thought this channel is about D&D and power metal
I hope he’s got what he was looking for
Can tool that product for $15K max and the unit cost of like $4.00. I don’t know where he got his quotes from, horrible pricing. Hopefully he does well.
Absolute Sigma what a great bloke 😎
Hope this guy makes millions.  These blow holes don't know where the work gets done.  Glad he got picked up.
*YUP!*
Well, im done here. Off to the pub!
I was speaking to a gas fitter a couple years ago, and he said he had thought of great product. This was essentially it.  I told him it was a pipe dream.
Bro how did these dragons get anywhere in life with their shitty close minded attitude
the "I've sent out 3 or 4 emails" got me 😃
But its a small t square a compass a degree measuring tool and has many other aplications beyond just a perfect pipe measuring jig.
It’s definitely diy. You don’t need to own the tool to do it, you just need to borrow it. That’s how diy works.
I love this guy! Hope it works out!
I'm so mad at that lady that was like "my husband does so much DIY but we NEVER do our own tile, we ALWAYS hire a tiler, so DIY is not your market" Like lady, do you not understand that this invention has made it possible for everyone to do their own tiling? There's DIY tools for literally every part of tiling except for getting around pipes, and this man has just solved that problem, making tiling instantly accessible to  everyone regardless of skill or experience. It's airheaded to talk to him like that about what is clearly an industry game changer
vaya gentuza
7:25 He doesn't know if craftsmen still you pencils?????? What does he think what they do, lasering everything on the go?
Done this many times from age 10 working with my farther in the trade decades ago without this pointless tool how does one "Gotta be quite advanced to use this tool?" People have had no problem measuring with a regular ruler and tape measure. This will help a small percentage of DIYERS that butcher tiles and flooring but a percentage of those still have the problem of disconnecting gas/water pipes so for what it is to most that need it its not worth the money if they are paying somebody to disconnect and reconnect the pipes
36$ in canada
Guy probably got home then grabbed and yelled “OI JIM! WONT BELIEVE WOT I JUST SOLD!”
I think the missing piece it that this could be used to template around pipe, posts, etc., for _any_ type of flooring, not just tile. Laminate, tile, carpet, wood.
That guys awesome
Never heard of the Dragons Den ? Whats next the Goblins Pit
Doesn't need a big speech, has a good product that can be used by professionals and home DIY people.
I tought they were sharks???
He staright up knew he had nothing to lose lol
I used one of these to tile my bathroom recently worked a charm. Dragons make a good point about demand for volume glad to see his business doing well regardless.
This is incredible, you can do that with a tape measure.
I don’t think any of those dragons have picked up a tool box in their life
He's not laid back, he's just not bullshitting. He knows his product, he knows his limits, his presentation was clear and to the point, and he is 100% honest about all of it. Awesome. Wish the guy all the luck in the world.
He said yup and they didn't believe him.
This is genius product he low key would’ve done way better had he the opportunity to be on American shark tank
Legend🤣
All it takes to be an inventor is the awareness to recognise a problem that can be made easier to solve. Simple problem - how can we cut holes in the correct location on tiles. Up until this invention, it required a skilled tradesman with a good eye or a lot of fiddling about with inaccurate measurements.   Nothing groundbreaking, but our ability to invent as humans are why we have been so successful as a species.
We bring tilers.  That’s not what DIY is, is it?   Anyway, smart investment. The company is worth 1 million, now she more than made back her money, if she sold now. Which I’m guessing she will not, since this was all recent enough that the business is probably still growing at a good pace.
He just wanted to get back to the bar
He strikes me as a bit disrespectful and entitled for a man making a pitch. Tiernan McCorkle though, is such a beautiful name.
When.was this originally aired? I Have a tool like that for years
"I won't waste your time." What a legend.
This seems like a rip off of Shark Tank
He’s a simple man with simple needs
Love how when the final woman starts to point out the areas of massive potential the rest of the dragons stare as if they almost regret getting out on a chance to cash in 😂   Very clever to not mention it before everyone got out
dude could have at least negotiated the cut hes giving away wtf xD
“Thanks, I’ll take your offer. Oh by the way I forgot to mention, if you flip it this way it holds my beer.”  This guy is a legend. I’ll never need one but if I see it here in Australia Im buying one just because I like this guy.
Jenny's out
00:07 I thought i'm the only grown up who spill the water when drinking from glasses, good to know i'm not the only one lol
What a personality, loved it
I deff see this being used by contractors, plumbers, and electricians. Worked with my dad in construction, a tool like this will be very useful. It's just that the market is very very small. I'm actually really compelled to buy one for my dad. I wish this guy success.
2:17
Didn't even look back,lol
I’m a DIYer. I mean yes many of my family were carpenters so I’m comfortable with tools but I’d definitely do tiling myself if I needed tiling in my place and this seems great.
This product has been around for years. 😅😅
"My dad's into DIY, he's a DIY man" Literally the next sentence. "He has tilers do the tile"
Definitely not inspired by shark tank
Yep
This is the best pitch I’ve ever seen deserves everything he gets in life! 💙
Honestly if he keeps the price down tradesmen will get it eventually of its distributed to bigger markets
I cringe when I see shows like this clearly copying a different show in every aspect lol
I like how they always ask “where are you gonna get your customers” when they have hundreds of thousands if not millions of people watching. I mean this vid has 1 mil views 😂
Legend!!
All jokes aside fair play to him, he’s straight forward he’s made a good design and admitted he has no marketing skills on how to sell, and get it into shops etc, agreed that is the one area he needs help, Yeah he didn’t get the exact offer but he’s been offered marketing and manufacturing of the product which is more then a big help
Britain has some of the ugliest TV personalities
“We could actually tool this product for you and deliver a product ready to go”  “Yup”
Normal person Vs ....errr.... narcissists that think they're "Dragons"
what a don😂😂
What a chad
This guy is the Nick/Nate Diaz of the pipe measuring for tilers world.
Man...talk about a bite off of the US show.  Jeesus.
She’d have took 20%
I'll buy it ....
Is that Harvey price?
Everything is “yup” Gahdamn speak lad!
this came out in china 10 years ago
The word that comes to mind when I see him is absolute. Nothing crooked, nothing obscured or obfuscated, his whole truth laid flat plain and bare with the concision to be viewed in its entirety at a glance. An absolute lad, he is.
One of my favourite Den moments. Genuinely hope he gets success. One of the lads with a good idea, sucking it up and putting it out there.
He knows his product and he knows the product works.
Brilliant. Like his style
Why are the comments on everything so cringe these days?
Bro i wanna buy a drink for ya..
Funny to watch people who don’t lift their fingers for work act like pros don’t use markers 😂😂
He literally said “yeh” when she offered and then they stared at him until he was like no I take the offer 🤣 if any one else caught that
Love the narrator telling us the bleeding obvious.
What's happened to our English it's a rule not a ruler
They could have been like ill give you 5 dollars for 99%. Him- "yeah"
Some 1 let us know when this product smashes it
That's not frikking laid back. Bullshit clickbait.
Yall cheap-asses! For 41k I'd invest in it. A new product with patent and large market, why not?
I thought the thumbnail was a children’s drawing of an airplane
Bless his soul
Such an honest man , not pretending to know it all. Just saying what he has done with the product!
Cool guy
the amount of carpet puns in this video is insane
Such a wrong description for this video. For those who talk, get your ass into construction, and give it 100% everyday, like I do and many more professionals do, and then you have the right to say "laid back". Lots of people just don't get it, one of the most devalorized works is construction, though everyday, almost everyone sleeps between walls made from "laid back" people. 😒, idiots.
Such a gent!
You can see the rejection regret on the other dragons as he says “every tradesman aside from electricians will need this”
... haven't these been out for a few years, or a decade? I've seen them on wish at least 4 years ago
Can't argue against a straight up ,smart , fresh, idea with a patent.When you're a contractor, and even more so if you're a weekend warrior, - these kind of headaches are what can really slow you down ; the right tool, with the instructions how to use it. Clearly, most of the Dragon's haven't spent much time "in the trenches".
Hug and away hahaha
It sounds to me he only has a decent product but no business as he hadn't sold any or have the chain or outlet to sell it, to that point. I hope it works out with the dragon he went with though.
‘Do ya like dags’
Realest
A night on the tiles is in order.
Surprised Teirnan didn't enter the Den with a pint.
so its not actually anything new. he was honest too because ticking sticks arent new at all. but they go point to point not to the circumference.  so this is genius.
why does this look like a depressed version of Shark tank?
I could have really used this product on my last house I really messed up the laminate going around the radiator pipes.
Brilliant, cool guy!
i need this
I would have loved to see a couple of DIY folks using it as a mini commercial. I think it could show the potential visually...telling a picture. I could use this device!!! But I DIY...
Meaden makes me puke. She has a go at Tej but doesnt invest herself. Well done Sara and well done Teirnan.
Bet they regret that lol
I love it when real people win!!
A no-bullsh*t man. Beautiful.
This guys a lad I love him
Great example of people being too rich to understand the diy market. I know a few people including myself who'd love this product in our kit
Not really a great product.
to an all round diy guy or even a so called professional this is a must have piece of kit
So we got a deal? Yup
Good luck to the geezer...but I could have easily done that with a tape measure and pencil.
That ending was worth watching the whole video 😂
Brilliant love it
... she took 30% of the company but she gave him the key to life changing  knowledge and experience.
Absolute lad. He seems like he came up with this in a corner of a wetherspoons after having 5 pints of fosters. Which makes it even better
He won in life. He doesn't take things personally and has that stoic like character going for him. Brilliant.
Straight shooting, no bull, I'd hire him
Not for nothing but where all the Asians at, in the Dragons Den lmao
I like his demeanor!!!!!
I love when dragons take risks. Because that is the whole point isnt it? I hate when they base their deals on already existing sales history. Also so happy for this guy, I literally cheered for him. No Bs, straight to the point, in my experience they make the best business men and women
That's mancs for ya
I love this guy and delighted he got a deal!😂
OK mates, got something for you. You in? Sidenote : I think Sara Davies offer was fine because she will definitely be working for this and is not giving only the money but her time too.
Dear Dragons I've got an idea,  Employ liers, pedophile child abusers and goons. Then charge the public £159/year to watch tv.   Defund the BBC Funny how that business model actually works
This show is a prime example that being smart and innovative doesn't change the world. Money is what changes the world in today's age.
Good tool.  These guys are too rich to understand it use and purpose.  Pay someone to do the work.  They are lost
Would be venture capitalists.. pathetic really
What an amazing offer. I thought she was going to ask for 50%
I like hus pitch wow ppl r stuck up give the guy a break
As soon as I saw the product I knew I needed it.
I can't stop watching him... I wish him so much luck
2:18 Did anybody else notice the fly run across the camera lense? Lol
His market is Asia and Africa ! Europeans are just lazy .
Top lad great product.. hope he makes millions and sickens the rest of those nob heads..
This guy is a legend. I want more mates with his attitude!
Wouldn’t give a penny to this guy. He seems disinterested  and entitled. What a strange way to behave.
11:58. 😂  So funny
Did anyone else laugh there ass off when he agreed to the offer? Omg that is the hardest I've laughed all week. Fair play to him what a legend
Without any offence, which country is this show being hosted from, because their accent is  quite peculiar.
I think it is an amazing product. My dad is a tiler. he would definitely use for a lot of jobs.
He didnt even negotiate. Did he not see The Life of Brian?   "That's not how you haggle."   Why didn't he say 20%?
This is as if Korg (Thor Ragnarok) were on Dragons Den.
wot a guy haha
No problem veiws and opinions apreciated what a legend
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 no sweat 😉
Good product should have shown a tile fitter around the rad pipe that's an absolute nightmare to do what's she talking about tiling isn't a DIY job, hate to tell ya lady but ya husband is useless 😂
What a lad
This bit is exactly why Shark Tank is more relevant than Dragon's Den has ever been
This guy came up with this at about 4am around a glass coffee table with a couple other stragglers after a heavy night down the boozer
Does anyone kno what happened next?
I hope he makes a fortune.
Peter Jones is such an astute businessman, I like him a lot.
Hell no 30% that biy not diy 30% daaam id give 20%
Those millionaires don’t understand anything about the product.. 1 there not existed 2 no one is smiling 3 there investors not builders 4 they don’t get it
Most of the dragons took one look at this guy and said, "No chance in hell I'm working with this guy." They even kind of look disgusted lol.
Deserves it well done pal
China doesn't care about patents anyway
very smart, nice and genuine guy! I wish him all the best!
There are things already like this lmao
What off brand shark tank bullshit is this??
does anyone know how his firm is doing now?
He is laid back because he is from Manchester we are confident people 😂😂😂
He is the sort of guy you want to create.
This is the best item to be sold on a sales tv show :D would fly like fresh made cackes ... "Buy now for just 19.99€" . all the crazy old man bored at home spaming the phone to get one lol ..easy money
Dragon's den looks like a shithole shark tank. For Gods sake can they get into a room that doesn't look like a 30 dollar AB&B small warehouse ?  Great product.
I think the Dragon fancied him that's why she made him an offer.
That's an awesome tool
@11:34 He already answered her YEP here. That was a genuine smile that he was happy to accept.
If Duncan was still around, I wonder how their conversation is gonna be like. lol
not that good really as you need the pipe to be open ended, this would be useful to drill a hole accurately but then use a jigsaw or a grinder to cut out a section so you can fit around any pipe, but there are other ways for the DIYer on YouTube already.
I do wish that Skellygog narrator would stop making puns, it's the lowest of all the supposed humours.
A contour gauge is the closest thing, which is almost the same…
Am I the only one thinks this guy is literally a smarter Ricky from Trailer Park Boys?
The doyen of DIY
Such an amazing guy
I mean all you'd need to do with it is is patent it and license it out to a brand.
Deborah, you little heart breaker.
He's not at all laid back, he is just being himself and not enacting a sob story or drama , a genuine guy, inside-out, unlike many who are bad actors. Sadly TV needs a story for its show's TRP(Television Rating Point)...
I really like this bloke and I would happily buy this product. I can see how much faster it will be. only thing id modify is have the radius so it can be adjusted and you dont need as many pieces
They will need to sell 20k of them for her to get her investment back... assuming they got the price fown to 7.18 per unit as he said he could with proper molds and production. Siders,framers,electritions,roofers, carpenter's all don't need this only one MAYBE is a tiler or a plumber, and evem then plumbers dont even need this!! Oh maybe a cabnet installer.
Seems like such a cool lad haha. Goodluck to him.
Laid back? He’s a guy that came up with a great product and he’s not a salesman, he’s a tradesman. He’s honestly looking for financing to get his product out
This guy was like a breath of fresh air. Authenticity over showmen anytime.
Deborah Meaden… aka; Disgussssting nails!! 🥴
To anyone who works in plumbing or construction or whatever, how useful would a ruler like this be for you?
What a legend
I love this guy 🤣🤣🤣
the dragons laugh at the end because they all know he could have wiggled her down to 20 - 25% id say 22.5% in the end. Good lad big heart seems he really wanted a sound business partner and he got that.
I like the guy. He's an everyman but he had a good idea. Good luck bro.  Kudos to the Dragon as well for stepping in.
Love that guy
06:30 that moment when he just realised that it wasn't  Deborah that was the DIY expert and Theo was his man. Too late.
OMG I love this Guy. Hope he and Sara make millions 😊
They had absolutely no clue what that thing does and what problem it solves and no interest in learning more about it. But they had to piss all over him just to show dominance.
As an American DIY'er, I'd buy it and I dig the phuck outta Teiran's cool arse confidence!
I don't see why this is called a laid back pitch, it's so good!
12:00 hahaha I love this guy, so good
Absolute legend.
The 41,000 is the most random and specific number ever 😂. I wonder how he came up with that? 😆
Dragons Den sounds like a video game
Love this guy top bloke
I feel like he could have easily gotten it down to 25%.
Sarahs connection to a builder and her working class background really paid off here and she spotted its brilliance, the others all missed a trick. These will sell by the truckload good luck to him.
£17 for that to be made ... I could make that for around £1.50 each easily (I own many 3D printers that print plastic which will work prefectly for this kind of stuff ) also your sell price needs to be wayy down. more around £7 - £10 . if you read this and want to sort something out then message me :)
Job done get on with it now
Sara's question is right on the money.... DiYers  don't do enough volume, early career stage pros are ideal.
Genuine chap, hope he makes it.
Did the voice over team leave any puns on the cutting room floor?
How greedy are some people that they can't help open a door for free....!   The world is sick and greedy and these people make me not want to watch dragons den.
Perfect for qvc and Ideal world TV shopping
Just straight to the point. What a legend
Risk takers have exponential results!
This looks like one of the tools you see 5000 different copies of on Alibaba and in drop shipping ads on FB - I wonder if that's a consideration for investors, maybe the patent would protect against profit loss from knock-offs?
Small ones for the smaller jobs! Large ones for dry liners and brick layers or simply add an extendable tape measure on the ends 🤷🏼‍♂️ get a little range going
I'm thinking... I'm thinking....  Peter: do you want to think about it?  No..No....  Haha
This guy is so laid back, if he was anymore laid back he'd be horizontal.
Imagine if it was Jenny Campbell who was seated there, the chances of getting a deal go down by 20%.
I hope this guy makes millions, what a legend.
this tool already exists in various forms
The Chinese have been using these for years ..
The bloke doesn't think tradesman use pencils to mark their holes. Bro I only worked in trades for four years but I can tell you I used my carpenters pencil and text every day.
At least he's honest about what he knows rather than filling them with rubbish
FAF brilliant
Literally just watched a video of someone tiling using a very similar tool 👀
Bam bam Bigelow
I think he could of counter offered for 25% and got away with it
He looks a handful. 👊
I'm a tiler I would buy one
What a legend
This was good.
Hi
oh, I like this guy! I'd buy that
Salt of the earth
Toadie hadnt changed one bit since I stopped watching neighbours 20 years ago
11:44 funniest Dragons Den moment ever 😂😂😂
I can't even lay a brick let alone a pipe and even I want one of these things
Uhm not even there. Uhm oot!
If he was anymore Laid back he'd fall over
To me he seemed very nervous
Sorry but there is LOADS of these types of things that do the same thing
Fair play to ya big man Good luck God bless! 👍🏻☘💯🥂🍾
12:22 - "I'm not sending you to negotiate any business deals"  You own 30%, chill.
What a guy, just cracked on with it bless him.
cool dude. very fair deal by Sarah. good for him.
That ending from the dragons makes it sound like this is the guy the you never hear about once a company becomes so huge in a few years and create their origins documentary.
She was definitely taking 25%
I absolutely love how he just walked out... Bloke said, thats it I got me money you got your hug.. The rest of ye can naff off now..
I like the guy
I wonder.. is he doing good?
So many situations for this tool. Amazing idea. So simple so good
He's of Irish decent and was reared to be humble, which is why so my Brits of Irish decent storm the UK world of business. Good Man Tieran!
I will buy this. Frustrated to measure center of the pipe - WHEN pipe isnt straight enough
Alright no problem.
I can DIY that product cheaper with acrylic sheets and some screws.
Is nobody gonna mention how gangsta that exit was? Makes a deal and just walks off - doesn't even look back
The end made me laugh so much
I'd need one of those
I like his idea. One thing I hated growing up was the holes being bigger than the pipes for the radiator, and the stuff that could fall down
I thought the way he walked out was very rude quite frankly, she made a good offer he excepted yet barely said thank you.
The dragon's are more nervous than he is
What a great bloke, he has done his homework and I wish him all the success he deserves.
When was this shot? I've had one of these for years albeit without the "pipe" attachment...
The most retarded show.
He's not dumb. He designed that thing and it took him 0.005s to mentally process the deal and accept it. And being that smart and fast of course leaves tons of time left to be at the pub. Best of luck to him, he's the sort of person that *should* succeed in life.
That product is already existing in the market. He recycled the idea.
“hello i’m theo”  “okay theo”  😂
What a top bloke!  But businesses these days don't like straight shooters. They just want some "yes men".
Now that in my opinion is a laid back legend.
“Erm no I wont waste ye time sounds gud ill tek yer offa” - #1
The man was honest with what he wasn't fit to do he did the hard part and it would be very hard for him to get this into stores but with the help of a dragon who is extremely experienced in that field why would u chance that all to get a couple percent back HE JUST AINT A BULL SHITTER
Now that's a guy I can work with.
It's basically the same as Shark Tank but all the investors are James Bond villains. Lol.
i thought he was gordon ramsey on a rubber mask
Proper British Bloke
Would've been a completely different story with American sharks. They would've seen more value. I'm in construction in the states and it's obvious.  Goes to show you can be rich as piss and ignorant about a whole aspect of a market.
not sure when this was pitched but there is a product exactly like it on the market
I'd buy this, I'm good, this makes it easier and cleaner
cutting edge invention hehe, they getting cheeky with the pun
2:18 - fly
So business men decide to invest without researching the market or the business owner
Top bloke, no BS, no waffle and straight to the point. Hope he does really well.
I'm sure I've seen videos of Chinese people with almost the exact same thing for tiling years ago
I'm sure I've seen similar rules that do the same thing before advertised on FB, Aliexp and such.... Does the rotating bit make that much of a difference or was this the original tool that got copied by everyone else out there?
I would buy 1
What a shark tank ripoff this is
probably my favourite person I've seen on this show lol
30 percent. That'll do! Hope he asks for mates rates on the injection moulding though. Top lad!
she lifted him up, only to crack him down even further lol savage
Love this guy’s energy. No bs, all substance.
It will be copied in Chn in no time.
I'd buy that thing for 20 bucks to fix those tile holes with this ruler! Hate the measuring with a ruler and a pencil...!
Pen in ear the lot lol what a gent
Oh man, did I laugh at the end. Good on ya, mate.
Great inventor, bad at business. 30% is a decent outcome, if she was meaner she could have easily asked for 50% and got it.
Where do I buy this
If he was anymore laid back he'd fall over
This guy could sell a second hand flesh light 😂
How would this work for different diameter pipes? Would you need a different tool for each diameter?
Net worth now over 1 million gan on son!!!
Apparently the company is now woth well over 1 million, fair dues
I'm gonna go on dragons den with a little speaker that says the word "but" and the buttons will have the attitude you want to say "but" in, and my target customers will be the dragons
"The thing is when I invest in something, I wanna know how it's made, when it's made, what the drills name is, what the screws think of the drill, and what the drills maiden name is"
he's brilliant
I won't waste  your time 🤣🤣🤣 legend reminds me of an Aussie
*I'm Jenny and for that reason I'm out*
Sarah Davis is such a refreshing addition to the team. Really backs the person and not just a typical business stereotype! 💪
" ive sent 3 or 4 emails" lol dude that is not due diligence
He kept saying "eh" all of the time. He was nervous and it shows. He really wasn't laid back at all, he was stammering.
There's pipe markers already out on market lmao
Sara knew exactly what she was doing when she said what she said in the beginning. She gave a big statement that was not good about the selling point. Which made the dragons think a bit and go with no. But she knew what she was doing. And she got a deal
I would buy
Swear this has bin out for years
Yep.
Ay Another honest Yoooorkshire man.... I tell thee that for nowt.
Manc businessman, says he wants 40 grand, willing to give up 50, places it at 15, let's her negotiate the percentage, knowing she's gonna double it, she pays the for product, she does all the marketing work, he still owns the larger majority of the business. As we Manc's say "Jobs a good'un 'appy days!"'
What a nice change for a pitch. No bragging no BS, just a nice genuine guy who lacks what he needs to elevate his product. Good luck to you sir
Dude didn't even look back or say bye, just hugged and fucked right off! xD Top bloke!
He got ripped off. The money was to buy tooling. Now he's buying the tooling from her so she gets the money back.
Legend
Love this bloke! Walked out after a United game, couple of pints down, probably thought you know what, fancy pitching my product on Dragons Den & here he was. Really chuffed for him - looks like a genuinely good lad to work with!
Frank Reynolds would bust out a sandwich.
Which came first? This or shark tank?
2:21 The way he greets that dood so carelessly is hilarious 🤣
I'm in Atlanta. We have huge flooring stores. These people are idiots. I'd buy this all day to make better cuts. Home Depot, Lowes,  sell this all day long. And I'm not a tradesman but . I'd expect this level of accuracy and finish from tradesman.
30 percent is very humble considering he had no other offers i would have taken that in a heartbeat considering the value she would bring to the company
stand up guy
Jajj
This reminds me of garlic peelers. It’s kind of useless, and you could do the same without spending 5 bucks on one, but as the dragons have pointed out, it’s just not good enough.
Jenny saw this and said she's out.
Salt of the earth. Decent bloke doing his best and no BS which I think successful people actually appreciate.
Northerner....that's it, we don't mince our words, and we're not uptight or up our own!
Love it, proper nice lad, well done 👍
what a top straight talking bloke good invention
News: A meteorite is heading towards earth to destroy all of man kind! This guy: Yeh?
Absolutely fair play to the lad.    Would love to know the out come of it all.
Robert Dyas isn’t a DIY store like B&Q surely the owner knows that! Being a retail “expert” besides one look in the niche ware department of Robert Dyas will reveal worse products than this…think Theo needs to talk with his board and buyers lol
Deborah is right. Bung a couple other rulers in there and MAYBE I'll consider it. Soo many other do-or-don't DIY tools out there to buy before this.
He's a bit wrong. Electricians could use it.   If an electrician runs their cables through a pipe of some sort, to make it futureproof, they could use it.
People get tilers in are well off, lots do it themselves and if you provide the tools then more people will do diy
Lol mancs for ya
*Four pitchers of the cheapest beer please*
This tool been sold online for few years already! Alibaba
It selling for even more than the price mentioned in the show on the website. Prices have not come down?
Patent pending - hmmmm!
This guy will say yeah to anything
https://youtu.be/ro3eVdG78_4  They have been using these things for years in China
These type of things come up on YouTube short videos of people in China using huge ones, they're available on wish for about £3! More plastic crap that will break and end up in landfill. As a carpenter, I'm out
Am I wrong in thinking a pipe width measuring tool is useless because all pipes are round and calipers can already do the job of this product? Like if you know the diameter you can find how large the circle is, you don’t need a circle measuring tool
This was 2019 anyone know how good this is doing?
Thank you everyone for praising this guy, makes me feel warm inside to see people in the comment section think like u guys, i felt accepted😥
That hug and walk out was funny as hell.
To anyone wondering, the company has an estimated net worth of a million dollars and seems to still be making sales and growing. So far so good 👍
He could have negotiated for a lower stake in the business, but hey he got the right person .
I would have tried to have Deborah endorse the product and use her to leverage a spot into the big shops for 10% of sales.
You’d think Rob Kardashian could just go to his sisters for some funding.
Where can I buy it!  I really need this. You NEVER get such an accurate result with a tape measure. And when you than need to make a hole at a visible spot in expensive large tiles this is a dream tool.
Gets rejected and his response @ 6:06 👌
Legend
I love this guy, I'm so happy for him. Possibly one of the most down to earth entrepreneurs on the show
every invention on youtube                China's making it as the show ends your  $50k patents dont mean chit to them so many   spend years trying to market new  idea's  -  soon as it sells Ebay/Amazon   there copys r  selling  1/2price
I like that guy, what a spade!
Have seen videos on here of guys using a similar product and probably better than this flimsy bit of plastic
That product is going to make a fortune.
Amazing to see how closeminded people are. I am a DIY person. I would LOVE something like this. You can use it for a lot more than tiling a surface...This is gold. And whilst there are other tools to do this, this sure is a nice addition to a toolbox especially for 20 quit.
I’ve been binging a plethora of “Dragons Den” videos and this is by far the best one
He has my name
I'd like to point t out that at 1:23 Dragon Theo is the ONLY one who exercised their manners and said , "Thank You" when handed the sample. I haven't watched the rest of the clip yet but if I were this guy...THAT'S the Dragon I would do business with.
Is this recent? This might be an incredibly successful invention. All the big tool companies are going to want to make that!  I hope he doesn’t get fucked over and they pay him peanuts on the actual sales.
Cheap, affordable because of that he would make money off of his tool. As he did state it really is affordable.
I need 41,000Q, 40,500 for me tool, 500 to pay me pub tab! 😅🤣😂
it is a cool tool.
As a professional tile setter myself I don’t think this product will sell. I love inventions like this but unfortunately the market isn’t big enough. Most pipes that need to be cut around will have a finishing flange to cover the ugly cuts. Pipes for showers I always cut a small square hole with a grinder because it’s super fast and accurate. And the odd one that doesn’t have a flange like a round floor drain can easily be measured accurately.  Here’s hoping I’m wrong for his sake.
Check the Wickes or Screwfix website and see what you can get for £20. This tool makes an extremely difficult task very easy, for less than the price of the drill bit. Genius.
seems u just have to be salt of the eat from up north to get an offer from sara
Click bait title
A man with a pen behind his ear is a man with confidence
For £20 I'd 100% have bought one of these when I did my DIY tiling at home. Trying to measure cutting points is an absolute ballache. The dragons here forgot that not everyone is a millionaire with the luxury of being able to pay through the roof for a pro 😂
Legend
Aww I can tell, right off the bat, he’s a super shy one. I’m sure social activities makes him anxious, which isn’t a bad sign at all, probably a very humble guy.
💨💨💨
Man after my own heart. Well done fella wish you all the best oh and the tool is great! I’d buy one 🙃
Advanced DIY. Lady. My mum is 70 and she owns a draw, angle grinder, saws, tile cutters. Please. Just because you don't get your manicured hands dirty.
Sarah's just a beautiful soul. She invests in people.. not just products.
I absolutely love people like this, don't pretend they're anything they're not, know their strengths and no rubbish just cut to the point. absolute class wish him all the success
let me know if this retails !
Net worth is 1million now wow
Great looking product
Seriously the US is a huge market. All the houses here!!! I need this thing.
the dragons that declined his offer most likely have never driven a cargo van full of tools around the neighborhood, or did their own remodeling, this tool is fantastic, not only for tiling, but for cabinet fitting, installing kitchen countertops and vanity sets, light fixtures, etc. I can see its applicability everywhere, and at 20 pounds it's a steal for the time and quality measurement you get out of it
As a sparky I would buy this product!
Love this. Everyday guy comes up with an idea and manages to get investment.
there's a million of these cheap marking tools coming outta china. dunno when this episode aired but its by no means a unique bitta kit
I’m Jenny I’m out
Deborah looks like she been blowing off sailors as always
Can someone with more intelligence than me explain why having 30% of a business is worth anything if youre just gonna give him all the money anyways?
The cutest big boy ever! 😅❤ by the way, its not about him being laid back, that's just purely his personality! So glad the last one saw it.
Is this really from 2021, i work in the hardware store and we have something almost like this coming from china
A great tool I didn't realise I need. So simple and will.pay for itself on the first couple of jobs. Good luck to him.
Fare play that man, loved it
I'd but one for going round radiator pipes
Theo The Fetus making sure the children's Inheritance still remains untouchable
Haha Class... northern style.
no tradesman (tiler, plumber etc) is wanting this. i could either waste my money on this and have it take up space or,, i could just measure to the center of the pipe with a tape instead of messing with that thing. the only way this thing will sell is if you do a gimmicky instagram or fb ad video showing it being used and convincing depressed dads to buy it so it can fill up their workshop of unused gimmicky tools.
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS PRODUCT???
So what does it offer AFTER the pipes are laid and you cant simply just slide the material over the pipe
great invention just not investable. glad to see him get a dragon weirdly though.
When they hugged i bet their bellys rippled
Why does one man have to do everything. This idea is great he just needs help on the marketing and business side. If every tradesperson has one of these you could make 10s of millions I don’t see why they don’t see that. Not everything has to be useful to everyone.
I can measure the diameter of that pipe and redraw it on that slab....
I wanted this guy to say ,   " well fook the lot of yees "  ..then walk out !
What you see is what you get
thats how we do things in our great USA... thats why American's are the best
hope this business does well! cheers mate
This is the kind of guy that'll put the work in to make it happen. Solid attitude and smart. Hope he succeeds.
Laid back Larry 👌🏽
Straight up guy. I would use this. The amount of money I’ve wasted on materials that’s been cut wrong. I would supply all my  Apprentices one too
None of these rich snobs know just how useful this piece of kit is to people.
That has to be the most manchester name ever
Company is worth 39k GBP by now!
He reminds me of Peter Kays character in Car Share.
Can any one show me a f1 car with no drs to pass on the inside of copes b4,lewis, a man of his caliber should never endanger another driver at this speed, Hamilton could not handle being beat in  silverstone two days in a row,get well max,i am a danny ric fan,i only commented for the love of f1
Laughing all comments saying how good a product it is 😂😂 (tradesman)
If you have a tape measure and know the pipe diameter... This is a rather pointless tool.
Cheers guys
the only problem with this is regardless of the patent, "bootleg" products that are the exact same will come out of the chinese sweatshops, straight onto amazon and aliexpress, for a fraction of the price that this will ever be able to sell for. its a great idea, but plastic is worthless nowadays.
Next gadget in my toolbox! Worth the money just to support the guy, top bloke!
Good deal.  she will manufacture it in the injection moulding machines worth the extra 15%.
“Yeah”
He's too laid back to make it a success
That one dragon at the end of the clip said it all "A straight shooting guy". I agree, he tells it like it is and no messing about.
I appreciate what this man stands for and what he represents
Most pipes are already installed, very rare that you slip a tile over an open ended pipe like he did
Debra’s points were really valid she knows what she’s talkin bout
That’s how you get in and out with a deal, no messing about. Top guy
She had him at "hello" bahahaha
Good on you lad
That could be lasercut for about £1
I don't even need one and I'm buying one
I absolutely love this clip. Teirnan seemed like a heck of a guy, really inspired by him~
tuck in the shirt, button the collar.
absolutely love him “i wont waste your time ill take it”
yep
Im "Keen DIYer" and I would buy one!
Good luck to him. He totally could have negotiated to maybe 20% but hey, he’s happy.
I could’ve done with this tool when fitting big trespa panel in the shower. Would help me s lot.
His face at 11:20 was like "really?" 🤣
Typical Scottish guy. We have lots of them in Canada and they are good guys
it takes a carpet fitter with knowlege of offset recess 3 way scribers to do this, well done, now hopefully he does not have to wear his knees out kicking carpets anymore. good luck
He most likely could have got it down to 25%
remember that Jenny invested and offered loads more than this Theo. I miss Hilary De Vil
Mate that’s a good tool
HE IS JUST A LAD - nice
goated demonor
Never give em more than 49%
Hate the dragons, arrogant.
How has he gone on would love to know
Good luck with the patent pending. This product already exists for many MANY years
That last line has never ever made me laugh so much what a guy!
This man's spirit animal is the honey badger
Debra come off as a right pos
He is a traveller.
Do ya want to get married? Yep, sounds good.
Just a normal working guy that will now make millions from his awsome product.Wish him all the best...If he was any more laid back he would fall over!!......
“We get tilers in to do our tiling” well we aren’t all millionaires are we
Patent pending ........sniff
I’d buy that.
My opinion as a tradesman in the US: First of all, there are already loads of marking tools like this in existence. They've been around for a long time.  Most of them are for transferring points or angles though. But there are already many methods with conventional tools to locate the placement of a hole, that all tradesmen should and typically do know.  I don't buy these things. I have enough tools to lug around as it is. But I also already own squares, rules, T bevels, a compass, even freakin laser beams. Loads of ways to measure out the exact geometry of just about anything.  This is a product for DIYers, who may not have much more than a tape measure and a drill, or aren't aware of those other techniques with other tools. But they need a problem solved. And this solves it.
Accent intensified in the Den
Proper tradesmen .
Did the deal fall through?  Change of company name 2019 and statement overdue. No mention of other directors etc. Or just too new to show up yet?
I don't know about laid back but I like Tiernan's pitch about his gadget which is based on a pantograph.  I also prefer Sara and Deborah's treatment of the pitchers to the boys, they aren't as visibly cutthroat,   they all know their markets and it's fickleness, it's also interesting to hear why something is rejected.
Usually construction related products and entrepreneurs are very legit about what their product is and does, because they are Craftsman's themselves
@12:23 Why not, I would have accepted 49%.  I'd rather have 51% of something than 100% of nothing.
The guys are intimidated by him being simple. They have no idea on what people do at their homes.
It's a great tool that everyone in the field needs, and if you have access to the stores to sell it in the UK and USA... why would you NOT want it? Have them made cheaply in China, package them nicely, put up some advertisement stands in plain view, and this thing will earn itself back in record time. Production and shipping cost: $4 USD a piece? Sell for $29,99 a piece. Even if it's not a business, it's a great product to have in your arsenal.
Also he could  be the pub landlord lol the comedian haha 😄 classic you could talk to him about anything and he will agree with you great
Brilliant 👏 straight to the point ppl from Manchester like us up north lol
Damn, as a contractor I would LOVE to have one of those.
Brilliant 🙏
At last, someone who just sells it straight down the line. Lol
That was a nice change ....
Tubbytastic
yep
One day I'm going to come there with my 5 inventions, and I have more idea's.
Most successful businessman are laid back, they know a good product when they sell it.
Pencil marks in construction won't be replaced by technology. Simple is always better
Hey Pathetis, how about you pay my family the rent you owe us, especially since my father who owns the shop you leased from us has now died. You know, instead of sending us letters telling us you think we should let you occupy our property for free.
Best guy ever lmao
Sara says…..I’m not sending you to negotiate any future deals….(but he clinched this one with her)….🥳
Hope this tool works better than his negotiation skills
I agree with Deborah, since this would be a great product to sell with a whole line of tools, including traditional tools and things like drill bits that compliment it.  Why make only the fries, and skimp on the burgers and shakes?
Yep
"Eeh, nope. No, won't waste your time. Sounds good. Yeah, I'll take the offa."  Legend
I say we mass call Theo's hardware stores asking for some sort of device that can measure pipe holes accurately.
I would add more rulers.  I've seen ones with 4 or 5 rulers so you can actually make a template for awkward tile shapes.  Most people couldn't even tell you if there's a space around their radiator pipes etc
Good luck to you my friend, you just needed a help in hand to get going. The others just want a quick return and gloss over your skill. Thank you Sara for seeing the potential in him.
Those "dragons" have never held anything like that.
This dude is _the_ definition of "top bloke" in my book. I'd go in business with this guy anytime, everytime.
I thought she was gonna ask for 50% tbh. And that would of probably been fair since she's going to do a good chunk of the work
i had one of these toys as a kid for duplicating shapes, you can still find them in toyshops
Awesome 👏…. Simple and effective…. No nonsense pitch 👍🏽

Dr Tess Lawrie writes to the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency after evaluating the Yellow Card data. She recommends an IMMEDIATE HALT to the vaccine program!  ...The nature and variety of ADRs reported to the Yellow Card System are consistent with the potential pathologies described in this paper and supported by other recent scientific papers on vaccine-induced harms, which are mediated through the vaccine spike protein product (2,3). It is now apparent that these products in the blood stream are toxic to humans. AN IMMEDIATE HALT TO THE VACCINATION PROGRAM IS REQUIRED whilst a full and independent safety analysis is undertaken to investigate the full extent of the harms...  ...The MHRA now has more than enough evidence on the Yellow Card system to declare the COVID-19 vaccines UNSAFE FOR USE IN HUMANS..
Anyone know what happened to him
It would be cool if it has measurements written on it. Just in it's prototype self it looks functional then again what do I know, I am no pipe welder. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Finally she invested in something! Great!
Honest bloke, good product , he freely admitted he had no idea how to sell it.
The direction of this show is terrible. I don't need a narration of what the next investor is gonna ask, when you guys will show me what he will ask. 😂😂. This is the first time I saw this show, and definitely will be the last.
Sell them on Amazon!!
Lad.
Typical cool manc 😎
She slammed the product at the start to deceive the other dragons then swooped in with an offer after everyone else pulled out. Respect the hustle.
Why does he remind me of Peter Kay
I was expecting 50/50 equity with the amount of work to be done. Amazing deal! Well done Toadie from Neighbours
Wouldn't this guy be cheaper buying a 3d printer
If Marvel's Korg was an actual person:
12:08 absolute legend haha accepted offer and gone with the wind good luck pal
what you're actually looking at is a guy with an 85 IQ making a business deal
What a beast, product looks good as well, hope he does well.
Pretty much the same as this https://youtu.be/WYWxVcbS20g
i want one
I just need to figure out a way to make it cheaper...... oh it’s China then... this is how business works
Best acceptance of an offer ever.
30 % for 40 grand is an amazing deal for her.   Even 15% would be.
U gotta love this guy and his style... ''Hey I don't know what the first thing about marketing but here's a tool I know everyone will need, take whatever % u want but get it to market and shake ma damn hand''
That hand in pocket gives a lot of confidence
Teirnan The Man 🙌
6:36 wtf are those nails Deborah 🤢
I've seen this type of device on TicTok  numerous times over the last two years... it's not patentable
Guy sure knows how lay pipe, or better yet, fit pipes into holes.
There are heaps of things like that from China…
At the end of the day he’s got a cracking product and he knows it fair play to the guy
Biggest balls in the room.
I wouldn't say laid back ... He knows his limits and doesn't BS.
Brilliant
Now I understand why my father moved us to America, traded a little bit or elegancy from the overall public in exchange for people who actually know how to do business LOL
6:31 - Theo - ‘ I’ve got nearly 100 hard wear stores ‘ ‘ Yeah? ahh yeah ‘
What a hero
He would have been totally wrong if he dared walked away or negotiated. Wish him all the best
That polka dot woman is awesome
This has to be one of the best DD
Proper tradesman mentality, he's not there to small talk, just do the job and go home. Haha
She was saying you would need to be quite an advanced DIYer to have that sort of thing at home but what she should understand is that most tools will be bought at the point at which they are needed instead of bought just in case they may be needed in the future.
What a lad
I could actually use that. I’m already googling it
Smart invention.
I wish this guy well,he had a go,but 25 years in the trade of laying stones and tiles,I have never had to cut and drop a stone or a tile over a pole,never,and never seen it having to be done.
These have been out for years
Love it. Perhaps the most genuine episode of Dragon's Den (or Shark Tank) ever. The investor is an honest guy with a great, simple invention. However, he's really in the prototype phase and he has no business savvy whatsoever. Hence, a deal for 30% where a Dragon does all the work is exactly what he needs.
In a world of pushy sales, bullshit, style rather than substance here we have a fantastic indication that it is actually skill, genuine product knowledge and experience that really matter....
I want one.
Honestly as a former tiler i can confirm that this is a great item though i wont use it because it will just take too long to get out of tool box and set up and the turning knobs will get all jammed up due the construction environment e.g. dust, glue, water etc. Nothing beats a tape measurer and a pencil  Too fast and convenient
Its my favorite show now!!
This country needs these guys , plain speaking , good idea and needs some help taking it forward. I sincerely wish him well .
Class, straight up guy
Seems like the guy you would see in an EDL march and trolling ethnic people
Close your eyes he sounds like Steven howson  stratford paddock 🤌🏼🔥
This guy is amazing!  Was so pleased he got his investment, great product too! Good luck boss
Best pitch I’ve ever seen, love this guy 😂
The dude is not greedy, he knows his limits that's why he needs someone from the dragon.
When I used to do plumbing jobs that was the bane of my life measuring this and that distance it all takes time this may not be rocket science but even though I am retired I would buy one just to have in my tool box just in case , brilliant but simple idea ..
Did the chilled guy smoked weed before coming to the den 😎😌
A ruler and a pencil to drill the hole? Yes because no ones ever fucked up doing that LOL.
I hope he succeeds
Advanced diy? Cutting a hole for a pipe is advanced diy? Of course a women says that lmao
This programme is just a make th rich richer scheme
Love the pen behind the ear I hope it works out for him
If he was any more laid back, he’d be horizontal 🤣
I would buy it, heck probbaly would buy 5 for my mates and fams
it good for wiring opening also. like making a hole in a desk to run wires.  this is a real money maker. with millions of people getting EV chargers installed at home in the usa this will make cutting holes so much cleaner and faster.
he is the wrong country for this. the UK is not the place for this if it was in the USA he would make Million of  them and a place like HOME DEPOT would include it when you order your tiles  and have the home depot branding on it.  he would make 30 cents on each one and retire within a year. he should go to the international tool show in las vegas and he would sell truck loads. it all knowing your market and the UK is not the market.
Gotta love how he keeps his ballpen on his ear, just in case he needs to take any extra measurements or notes.
Too laid back  For that reason I'm out.
"Sent about three-four emails out"  😄
11:34 is when he accepted the offer from Sarah but it took the Dragons and producers another 30 seconds to figure that out.
Pipe easy lol sounds like a lube😂😂😂
What a legend. Class honest guy !!
He’s just a likeable chap ain’t he lol. No BS no lies no coating in candy.
This guy: "I'm not gonna waste ya time, yeah, sounds good I'll take your offer" Vicar: "I now pronounce you husband and wife"
"Yep."
A lot of DIY’ers do their own tiling. Really frustrating to hear that. I would buy this. Really useful.
The minute he showed how it works, I would have given him the money.
Sarah is too nicee!!
l recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago, can I get person who invested with her  comment below let's gooooo
Keeps 70% and gets the perfect dragon to help him pursue his dream. Love it
Deborah, seem to attack Tej, but Tej unfazed
Wow last dragon has it set for him how perfect
Straight forward man all the best lad
Damn I wish I had that tool a couple of weeks ago tiling my bathroom , wrecked about ten tiles trying to get the holes in the right place :-(
Why would anyone think twice about taking Sara Davies if she offers?
Seen similar better ones in China
Well done that man!
My man being a real Life Nick Frost character. Brilliant
Good lad from Manchester 👍 no bullshit
I seen this tool on Instagram YEARS ago. Some person in asia was using it.
This guy is awesome well-done mate , crying 😂 at the end lol
Absolute legend
I'll buy one when they come out, honest straight forward guy and that will shine out in the product.
well done.... he's just calm not laid back
Honest bloke 👊🏽👍🏽
This will make money
Sara invests out of her humanity she’s the sweetest lady
Theo your a pleb
its nothing new.. seen it before
Surely you’d negotiate down?? What’s to lose reslly. Okay I get it he’s laid back, or to the point whatever you want to call it but Just say “can you go to 22.5%?!”If she says no, 25% then. You’ve saved 5% of your own company for yourself.  I just dint get why so many people on this experience don’t enquire to go lower for more of THEIR OWN business?! Like why 😂 give yourself a chance
Wish my manc accent was more like his rather than proper nasal Salford
Watched his demonstration and still don't know how it works
We all know now how this investment idea ended - The House Crowd went into administration in February 2021 with thousands of investors loosing money. Fraser Fearnhead was delusional in the Dragon's Den and continued with his extravagant ideas with claims of 'master class' pension property skills which duped investors to part with their hard earned savings.
The dude of Big Lebowski re-incarnated.
Even the 🐉 were surprised with his answer to the offer 😂😂😂😂
Well done Toadfish
What a super cool guy. I’m glad he got an offer. And he strikes me as a creative problem solver and this probably isn’t his last or most profitable invention. Best of luck to the dude.
If you don't know how to use and where to use that tool  Then you are not a diyer
Why not just do a trail without investment, profit margins will be low but if sales are shown. Then it's proved it self and invest to bring the price down?
What a great man
Why am i keep seeing theo randomly pop up to cover peter and toukar
Fair play to him! Come up with a very useful product and knew he needed help in every department to get it out on the market. Wasn’t fake about it and still got a deal. Fair play 👏
I've seen these before, years ago, but can someone tell me if it's the same as the others out there or different somehow.
i like it so eazy usefull for workers
I like this guy, hes straight to the point, no fucks given. I hope he is very successful with this product 😁
The slim saudi arabia positionally guess because gander steadily mix an a lamentable leaf. sudden, solid sunday
haha she could've asked for 50 if she wanted!
Best ever!
PLEASE ADD SUBTITLE INDONESIA 🙏
I like this guy, he's down to earth..!!
Love this guy,just tells it like it is
And with that. Added to my cart
Teirnan smoked 8 joints before coming on
Honest paid off
His bang on the gear 😂
What an absolute hero.
She liked him. And he's married (touching his ring when he's about to respond), that's why the hug doesn't last long and she's left wanting more. Respect this guy for respecting his wife.
OKEY YAH
He has zero business acumen but pleasantly nice guy with a decent and useful product. Wish him all the success
Seems like this could be an amazing product for selling with tiles. I would just approach tile resellers to be sold as a package.
I would use it.  She owns injection mold company she can make it for WAY cheaper. I'd jump on that 30%.
Smart choice.  Better to have the product on the market with one dragon then no product at all.  Honest bloke.
I love how he goes in for a handshake and she gives him a hug

I am a retired carpenter and i have  to say I miss the characters
So happy for him.
Dude is hilarious. Lesson to take home. Learn how to negotiate.
Good lad, hope it goes well for him
Every tradesman but electrician. Why would a painter and decorator, plasterer need it?
What a champ
I've never wished for a business  to worked so badly as I do for this guy. Genuine sincere guy
Overweight, scruffy and made no effort. The guy pitching isn’t too bad
Bless him, you can see he wants this so bad. I wish him every bit of luck and success in the World :)
What a legend this guy is. I wish I could be this calm and collectives
Chilled and not consuming oxygen for nowt. It is what it is for him. Top man.
I would buy this product...cutting accurately around pipes is time consuming and lots of room for error.
Top man, good luck to him
this not new, Adjustable Angle Ruler Drill Guides have been out for years
Subscribe to the NDL and Niko Omilana or your breath stinks
I don’t know if people use a pen or a pencil or a Ruler FFS 🤦🏻‍♂️ to mark the holes FFS 🤦🏻‍♂️ again someone clearly never been in the building trade or in the real world
Theo Mr arrogant phateis . I've got a hundred hardware stores
He didn't even negotiate 😅😅 He just wanted a deal. Smart man.
I love him .. very genuine 🙂
Anyone else love the puns?
Sounds soo much like Johnny!!!
Im a DIY person, I would buy this product.
He invented something that was actually good enough to sell just didn’t know how
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Wish that Debbie woould stop playing with those bloody nails.
OMG read the comments on this one! I love the internet XD
Think about no
Beginning part: “the person I’d like to invest in my business is Jenny”...said no one ever 😂
Patent pending….[snort!] 😂
Load of shite anyway.
Anyone know what happened next?
I am buying that
😂top bloke
Quality lad
I have a similar jig for kitchen handles, made from metal and it cost £180, but it’s paid for itself so many times.
Get in get out job done ✔
Sarah really has a mind of her own and does business with her heart in right place. She remains unfazed by the things that doesn’t matter.
I'd say laid back, but don't get into a dispute with this dude over payment and whether a job is complete. 🤣
Deborah looks so sexy in that red dress GODDAMN 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Top bloke. Hope his brainchild flourishes.
Good deal zara. This one made me  feel happy... But better go check that guy hasn't gone  got lost!
This guy is Mancunian, no BS, no frills, just upfront facts. I think he out smarted them with offering a 15% when he was willing to probably give up 40%. After all it is at tooling stage.
Brilliant
He was real.  Just a guy who works with his hands and warn his money against the grind.    I’m glad they didn’t try to exploit that.
I’m Oat
Sin Duda el mejor programa de todos estos, es SHARK TANK MEXICO.
One of the most honest pitches and characters, wish him all the best
Sarah is really kind hearted..she gives people a chance which is what they need...she has done this a lot with small scale growing entrepreneurs..The rest of the dragon just gonna give ya BS and bail out..They are the ones that really waste time..
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
The ending, wtf😂😂😆 he ll def take the offer
Love him hes ace
It's like i'm listening to Korg from Thor Ragnarok xD
Best of luck to the guy , seems like a stand up honest bloke
Same vibe from him as Karl Pilkington. Just being himself, no matter who he is talking to.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍🏻
Love this guy, honest
Sorry but it would’ve earned it’s keep more than  theos shitty gadgets he has in his store
Good man, well done and good luck
When I saw the pen behind his ear, I was sold!
Seen it.  The only type of guy that snorted /grunted his nose of stage and still walked away with the cash hahah
No Jargon needed here 😂
Yep.
He's not laid back, he's just not bullshitting. He knows his product, he knows his limits, his presentation was clear and to the point, and he is 100% honest about all of it. Awesome. Wish the guy all the luck in the world.
AT LAST!...a normal straight talking no bullshit bloke looking for his investment...Debra darling...you will see your arse ...when he makes a mint!
These have been around forever. My old dad used make them, it's called a ticking stick.
OMG... these 45 second intros...
First time I’ve laughed out loud to a dragons den 🤣
He must be fun at parties
This guy is a legend. Straight pitch no BS, what you see is what you get. I'm so glad he got an offer.
Good for you mate, Best of luck
did he make it?
“I’ve sent about 3 emails”
Shirt needs ironing 😆😆😆😆
Such a shame his business is in al ot of debt though 😞 he seems pretty nice!
Surely tradesmen are familiar with Euclidean geometry; they can already recreate the position of a pipe on a tile without his £20 gadget.
Judging by the size of him. He probably never had the stamina
He would be great to have a pint with. Lovely man.
Sara Davies ❤️
FYI the entrepreneur is also well known for consuming atleast 7% of the U.Ks marijuana every year since '92
This was a good one
The main reason the other dragons backed out was because they realized that they personally would be required to do alot of work to get it launched.
This has to be one of the best pitches ever on the Den 🤣
Yep, Deborah loved his tool. But you know it depends on how you use it. Your tool has to be customer-friendly and useable. Deborah didn't think she could use his tool!! So he went home empty-handed!! And so did she!!😃😃😃!!
Is Touker not in the dragons den anymore?
yayyy, nice episode :)
Any internet sleuths wanna give us an update on this guy?
I just don't see it personally.... things like screwdrivers are useful because you don't just use them for DIY, you use them to open toys, laptops, etc. This isn't multi-purpose in that way - it's extremely specific. Hope he did well with it, but it's not something I would buy.
After, very graciously, accepting the deal you know he's heading straight back to the 'boozer' to celebrate.  Good on ya mate 👏 !!!
Sure enough not many would act so casual as this guy did. He did deserved  the deal he got because he held his ground amazingly. Happy to see he walked out of the den and he got what he sought.
How does this work when you can't cut the pipe. He said you could go around light posts. LOL. Does he plan on cutting the light post. How are you supposed to get the gas line through the hole in the tile? What about an electric conduit pipe? What about a structural support?
https://youtu.be/lJRByc2Qp68
Peter's , "it clearly does what it says on the tin," is classic menh!... 😎
One of the best deals I’ve seen. Think it’s heartwarming : )
How could he not do well with her at his side and his calm demeanor that product will sell well to anyone?  I would buy that product in a flash if I had the DIY gear and time to do DIY.
The wacky grandmother intradurally whip because soccer neuropathologically wander to a jobless factory. mysterious, lavish advertisement
Deborah is always out.
It is a pretty good tool for the task its designed to do.
wondering what yr this was filmed since that tools been around for some time now even famous tik tok vides being used mostly from Asian laborers
Character him 😂👌🏻
Good guy.
Sarah - I want 30% of the business T- Yep
So glad a talented craftsman got a deal.. 👍
I love Sara!
Wow, Such a nice guy. I’m so glad that he got the investment needed for his product. 👍
Do They seriously have a cockroach roaming the walls at 11:47
this guy is goated
Useful tool but I can't stand tradesmen. And this guy is a typical tradesman that I imagine would be a feckin nightmare to work with. Too laid back, too indifferent, would probably hardly ever answer the damn phone and I imagine he'd be stubborn at times too.
Karl Pilkington on Dragon's Den
sounded like karl pilkington - yeh nah wont waste yer time ill take yer offer
This will always be my favourite one
"straight shooting guy" = somewhat simple
Good luck may your hard work pay off 👍
Lad
He was great... no, I won't waste your time sounds good I'll take the offer...lol
Sarah is awesome. Glad he got the offer and hope he make success of it.
I dont see the laid back part of this man. I see a hardworker, and not a great salesguy. Super that he got a dragon
That was the best!
8.54.     The dreaded ‘but’.
Absolutely sensational!!!! Wouldn't be a very good double glazing salesman but you can tell he is genuine and hardworking. Also ingenious products
It is a cool invention. This is guy is so laid back. NFG :)
Best episode ever. “Do you want to go and think about it?” “Na, waste of time that ain’t it” PMSL
He's back heading to the pub, nice broke though 😂
He must have been at the worlds most relaxing place before hand. Marroooojiiiii beach
who would believe this guy... he certainly doesn't look the part...
This guy is just,simply, being ~Himself, That's what makes him so likable ...
Why do we have to have these inane, moronic comments from Evan Davis (or Davies - I'm not sure how he spells his name)? They are totally useless, we know what is being said, we know what is going on, and I resent the fact that he treats us as though we would be totally in the dark without his telling us what we already know.  GET RID OF HIM!  I enjoy the programme, but I despise the commentary, hence a "Dislike".
Pen behind his ear. Zero bullshit here.
Do you want to think about it Teirnan?  Ehh, nope, no, won’t waste ya time, yeah, sounds good, yea I’ll take ya offer💀
I would have wanted 40% of the company at least if I were Sarah.  She’s gonna have to do a lot of work on this one.  Hope it works out for them.
Good entertainment. A conversation between the very wealthy and someone's who's a lot like a typical british trades person
Wont work/sell. Pipe has to be lifted up/out then tile slid over. Not practical at all.
Never been so happy to see someone get investment in my life lol
LMAO at the half-assed hug when he got the deal, just straight off to the elevator, if I heard right he even threw a "cheers" as he was walking off... Absolute legend.
I thought our Deb was gonna go for it! Sara is a badass! 👍🏻
Not being funny here, but why not laser cut it? no need to mold that mate, its 2 flat bits of plastic.
Chad bloke
Love this guy, does his work and just gets on with it. No drama, straight to the point
He may have come across as laid back, but he knew his figures in the main and was honest and upfront.  I would rather work with him than 90% of the people who appear on the show
It's coming Rome.
13:00  Nothing can be quite unique.  It either is or is NOT unique!
This is actually ingenious.
So you drill your hole. And then you realise you've got to dismantle your gas system to get the tile over the pipe.
Sara Davies always makes me emotional with her big heart helping people out and she’s very clever, she’s brilliant
I love his attitude!
The costs are still high tough, margins will be tight ,,💪
that's most english thing i have seen in a week!
He's not laid back, he's just not bullshitting. He knows his product, he knows his limits, his presentation was clear and to the point, and he is 100% honest about all of it. Awesome. Wish the guy all the luck in the world.
30% is not even bad
Good for him . He looks like a pretty cool dude.
Man just here for the deal-no hassles bro. ...I really wish him the best. Thanks to Sara Davies for coming through
I wouldn't call it laid back so much as straightforward. He didn't try some complicated demonstration or talk up the product as anything more than it is & everyone in the Den seemed to appreciate that even if they didn't invest.
Genuine and honest people like him are the people who deserve investment and success the most. All the best to him
What a nice guy. Hope he makes it BIG.  Seldom do all 5 dragons laugh at the same time.
Long moment of silence..... Tiernan mind goes blank. Peter: do you want to think about it Tiernan? Bloke mind wakes up: oh right, nope, sounds good, don't want to waste your time, ill take the offer.
Can’t believe more dragons weren’t interested in this. Great little product, wouldn’t mind one in my box.
I have a big crush on Sara Davies
‘Nothing at all’ similar.  Every other YouTube video: basically same thing but probably better
You just have to love Teirnan, doncha now?!  Good he has a dargon with him, Sarah will make the path for him easier...and yeah, he's rubbish at negotiation... not even to perhaps lower the equity a bit, would've only taken an ask!!
Sara quickly became my favourite dragon as soon as she started last season. Kind yet firm, and actually makes offers unlike her predecessor!
She could easily have got 50%
Good job he took the offer no issues
PipeEasy is what they called me back at uni
Proper builders attitude lol come in looking like a darts player lol
Theo looks like he's been on face app
I would find it hilarious if Theo decided to not leave his kids anything for their inheritance!
Top bloke
Aww what a lovely guy man, his honest and good spirit will bring him fortune im sure
Need the mantra for being so chill 🙄!
Mr. Okay
lol even at the end, couldn’t be bothered with small talk after getting the investment ‘right, off to the pub..’
This dude is a classic bloke....Off to the pub after this...😀
Pie Easy Ltd? I’m in!
It's a good invention but completely untested in the market so I thought Sara's offer was very generous. Especially considering she was not only offering her experience in building a similar brand but also offering him the tooling to produce the product at a much cheaper cost.  Even if she'd asked for 50%, it would still have been a very good deal. Getting all that for only 30% equity seems like an absolute bargain!
Breaking News!!!!! . .. ... .... ..... Jenny's out!
Now there's a device with little pins that can do exactly this and much much more, at least here in the US.
To be honest he's smarter than ppl think. The upside of having a dragon with so much expertise and considering he doesn't know a lot about running a business or selling a product him giving away 15% was a no brainer.
Hands in pockets Un-ironed shirt Big beer belly Lack of business acumen Unworthy of investment
Heart warming conclusion!
Great guy, good pitch and a good deal i'd say.
"quite advanced" Jesus man don't show her what a home plumber can do 🤣
Debra - I love this product! and I love when people make useful things, this is IT for me and unlike others in the Den I DO back a horse that isn't a sure winner, and for that reason I am out.
I’m happy for him
The hug was awkward 🤣 love the bloke, super laid back and honest.
'' Do you want to think about it, Timan?'' ''Err , no I won't waste ya time, sounds good, I'll take ya offer ''What a guy! Awesome deal made!
Imagine how much fun it must be to hang out with this guy lol
2:17 OMG what on earth is that
What laid back dude
This device is not new.....it's all over the internet....this guy is jus copying other s design outder...lol...🤣😂😂😂😂
i'll take one!
Electricians would love this too. We just call our pipes conduit. Wouldnt be used often but i see a great application for making runs plumb
This is the sort of guy who would just say what's on his mind at any time.
This guy is the textbook definition of a lad. What a champ.
His first yip was not " ok, I hear your offer", it was "ok, I accept your offer"
The ending brought a smile to a lot of faces
Hahaha what a legend. No sales, knew no numbers, didn't know how he would sell the product, and he still walked out with a deal. And a quite good one aswell. Thought she would want around 50% because of what I mentioned above, but glad she only took 30. Hope it does well
Sara Davis: I'm going to give you an offer which will make you millions but also put you in space with Richard Branson Entrepreneur: .... yep
He got the better dragon...Debra was not right for him. Considering Sarah has a tolling company this will cost less than 2 pounds to make.
I’ve needed one of these for decades 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
What a legend, he was just happy to get an investment. Good luck to him
Aight Feo 😂❤️
He should license the design to a big tool manafacturer, live off the profit, boom
Am I the only one who has seen a dozen of these types of tool on Tiktok or Youtube advertised by the Chinese?
Bless him
YESSSSSSSS I've been dying to see this one again. What a lunchtime this is gonna be. Remember the day bloody hell
Best offer accept in den history
I don't think many ordinary people would DIY when it comes to tiling and pipes.
Jenny: I'm not in this episode, so I'M OUT! (Someone had to...)
The water he drunk before going into the den is the problem.. If it was a vodka shot he would do it better...
what a legend 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. there the kind of people everyone loves. I hope he takes it to a hole new level.. good luck mate
These egg whites aren’t going to eat themselves
🤣🤣🤣 Bless him... Good luck! I really hope you sell millions 👍👏
He's not THAT laid back!
real straight up guy ..everyone should have a mate like this...no messing.
Look guys, the "tradesPEOPLE" thing is sooooooo 1990's.....  Please may  we think of another fad?
Absolutely love people like this! I wish I was just an ounce like him.
Sarah is my all-time favorite Dragon.
Great product hope he does well.
God Bless all entrepreneurs
These things are everywhere
Got my aluminium version from eBay for £8.
Hard to understand how a product that could be useful to most tradespeople isn't investable.
I love when people are like this. Even if you are a simple man without the highest education or the most unique skills you can still do something outside of your average job and be cool with it and far more successful than most people.
This guy is so laid back I'm surprised he didn't fall over. Wish him all the best
Why is Theo suddenly grow old?
I miss Jenny man, and for that reason I'm out🥺
Sarah, baby, do you think people do their own tiles for pleasure ?
From the thumbnail it looked like he developed a new type of green aeroplane!😂😂
He’s defo pitched this to his mates a couple of times in the local pub on a Tuesday evening after work
Tej never smiles
Waste no time, make a decision, execute, move on to the next part of the challenge.
Cheese sandwich for my lunch
He is the man.
Tea and biscuits today
Seriously, Sarah's offer was fantastic for him. I really expected any Dragon to go for the dreaded 50% because he seems really inexperienced, but him retaining 70% is great.
So glad to see Theo back, there hasn't been enough mention of childrens inheritance of late.
11:52 you can tell the guys thinking about what his wife told him to do when he went on and what to ask for and what not to do , he's thinking about what his wife says and plays with his ring... so hesitates.
What a nice bloke.
any more laid back and he would be horizontal
He's the man, hope it works out!
"and he's off" 😂
Love this guy...so natural honest and direct. What a refreshing dynamic. Good luck! Derek
So cool, great product I want one. Can be useful on arts and crafts as well.
Anybody thought that’s Karl plikington lol
I love this dude ^^
“ no won’t waste your time sounds good I’ll take your offer “ 😂😂😂😂
"Why haven't you done everything already and sold one to every household in the country?"  "Well I need help. And money. Which is why I'm here"  "Come on. Don't be so silly. Come back when you're successful"
really nice person.. wish him well
Nice to see an honest hard working tradesman bloke come into the den and get a deal!
This guy is chill asf 😂 no fucks given
THIS is why i love going up north haha man like Tezza
Toadfish has another job!
40K to go into the business and 1K to go on the piss . . . Great Bloke.
This entrepreneur is a HONEST genuine guy hope him all the success 💕💕💕💕
The worst thing you can hear on Dragon's Den if you're a pitcher is "I think you'll seem some/a few"
‘err… no no yeah yeah i’ll take your offer’ 😂😂😂
Thank you!!!! Life saving posting these ahahah
More chance of England winning the world cup than Jenny being not OUT!
I'm so glad he got an offer tbh
Soldier Mac - Hiphop/rap. Enjoy
This guy is so laidback that I’m surprised he didn’t do this pitch with a pint in his hand
Good on him.
Guy looks like he's walked out the pub and straight into the den 🤣 love his character
Good work man. You will get there
Italy took the cup. Haha
what a guy
I would buy one. Handy people and tradesmen will buy.
She should have offered for 50%
Sara makes an offer, crikey
Targeting it to a DIY-er who prefer to do it with the scraps of their pants. Smh. Could just use tape measures.
You can see his heart broken when Deborah declares herself out.
.... I dunno, seems like a toy I can 3D Print at home. A piece of paper can do the same work. And it's never good to have a pipe tightly fit to a solid material, cracking is a real thing.
What's everyone having for lunch?
Salmon, veg and potatoes today
Yo dragons, Say NO to lockdowns & the covid 19 scamdemic like Rachel Elnaugh, a former dragon has done, google it
guys, does anyone knows what could possibly be the best job in the world?
"Laid Back Den"
Lucky for this guy that Peter and DD have evolved or he would have been rejected by Peter just on his clothes.
🥶🍲
1st 😁 what's work without a lunch time dragons den.
