Just upgraded from an 11 and man I am in a different world. This phone rocks! 🎉
Smart guy replaced school with trampoline
3:15  looking back on the video after a year how tf does a phone feel grey   people dont feel colors
great vlog enjoyed the video
I love Steve jobs I love apple 🍎 thing different 🇮🇳🍎
4 hours screen time and its at 34 percent is tough though. my s23 ultra has 8 hours screen time and is on a similiar percentage
i love how apple adds stuff that androids had for years but does it so much in their own way that it makes it cool again (coming from an s23 user). ill be going to the iphone 16 pro max
I know I know I got the 15 pro max when the 16s are going to be released but I didn’t really want the best even tho this phone is the best
Your videos are always on fire, never missing the mark with awesome content! Salute the channel!
Bruh ive been gon so long u have a kid now
Went from 11 pro max to 15 pro max definitely worth it!
Anyone uses the IPhone 15 pro max without case, screen protector
You have to be a little more modest, no one likes bouncers!
ACTION Button transitions🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
18:33 I got 10 Hours of battery life in iPhone 15 pro max
I have the 15 pro max. I notice the power button is very sensitive. I power it down and it shuts off. All I have to do is push the power button once and the phone turns on. Is that normal on yours? My 14 pro max power button has to be held for 3 seconds and it powers on
Wireless charging is to slow tho unless there is amazing ones out there I don't know about
❤❤😊
just bought one going to pick it up tmr
How come no one talks about the drastic drop in battery life, am i the only one experiencing this?
I’m late in response but as I watched your video much earlier, I can say that I’m glad I went with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It just does all that I expected it to do; and not to mention, the feel of it….just right!!! Awesome video as always!!!🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤
I will be getting iphone 16
Is the video in the beginning trash or is it just me?
Nice office/studio man!!
watching on one
what is the mountain wallpaper he got on called?
Waiting for my new iPhone 15 pro max to arrive currently using my iPhone 14 Pro so excited to see the new iPhone 15 pro max hope it was worth the upgrade 🙏🏾💯
Trampoline Park❤❤❤
I thing this year the colors are the best ever! I like muted tones and those on the Pro models are very natural. I chose the Black Titanium on my Pro max. Its not black by any stretch of imagination, it looks like graphite grey, but i love it! And the phone in general is perfect. Its my first top of the line flagship (i picked only the basic flagships before like the iPhone 8 and 12) and i don't regret it. It deserves the 1500 euros i paid for it!
I can’t really notice much difference from 13 max to 15 max honestly
Will it be available for the iPhone 13 Pro ?
Good idea when i have money y Will show my car too
First time seying your channel and it's really good! Where did you get these iPhone wallpapers? Thanks! Best wishes for 2024.
Can we get the wallpaper please?
where’s the watch band from?
Where do I get that iPhone 15 wallpaper. Been looking for so long 😭😭
What kind of cable are u using at 11:40.. Thanks in advance..
Trampoline park 😂👍🏻
So cute x❤
Bruh the 2000 nits brightness is 1 of the key reasons i wanna buy it. Since i do ubereats delivery on an escooter, i NEED that brightness lmao. But i have 3 reasons stopping me.   1. I fell off my escooter in december 2022, breaking my elbow and fracturing my knee (my leg is cool and all but the muscle is for sure uneven compared to left), my elbow still cant bend like all the way like normal, the upper arm muscles are almost back to full tho.   2. My escooter got stolen when i started working again in october. Losing my $6,000 NZD escooter AND my job at the same time. Omgooooooood i was so pissed off. Contents Insurance didnt cover it coz i was “earning an income with it therefore its not a CONTENT”  3. My left wrist has been fractured since 2008 and nothing was ever done about it. But im now on the waiting list for it to be fixed. Then estimated recovery period is 6 months (although thats what was estimated for my arms full recovery so i dunno…). Ill have a cast all the way up to my shoulder JUST becoz of the ulnar bone above my wrist.   So if i had to guess, we’re looking at me unable to work until late 2024, potentially even until early 2025. So if we think that far ahead im probably just gonna buy the 16 pro max.
Ive had my iphone 13 mini since april 2022. Only use a case when riding my escooter (quad lock). I think i used a clear case for a few months when i first got it but no idea where that case is now. Other than that, i dont use a case or a screen protector. I havent dropped/broken it yet and hope to keep it that way. AppleCare+ is like insurance, ur item gets broken, u do a one off payment at a substancially lower price for a brand new one (or fixed). I dont have applecare+ so insert austin powers meme “i too like to live dangerously”. But the next time i upgrade (probably the 16 pro max?) im for sure getting applecare coz hellll nah am i paying full price for a new one if i do drop it. No offence to repair shops.
I like the wallpaper, could you please provide the link? 😅
They should start just making grippy backs for them or something like that instead of these easy to drop slick backs
Where did you find you lockscreen wallpaper, I really like it
@uravgconsumer how did you get that mountain wallpaper
lil bro has gotten so big makin me feel old😭😭
458 missed calls is wild.
That dog is a paid model 😂
When you asked Austin where we going my answer was taxes 😅
Wallpapers?
I'd been using the iPhone XR 64GB model since about 2019 before getting the 15 Pro. I have to say from personal usage and videos I've seen, If your current phone is an 11 (maybe 12 at a push) at least, it's definitely worth the upgrade. The camera qualities are VERY noticeable, the action button comes in great use (in my experience at least), the overall feel of the phone is a lot nicer, the screen and its animations are incredible. For me, definitely worth the upgrade from the XR. Great Video!
This is one of my most favorite iphone review right now jud you nailed it with this one seems like youre rocking your iphone caseless but be careful cause i saw  videos that this phone cracks easily but as of now the iphone 15 pro max is solid phone other than overheating issues thanks for the review 👍
little man is growing so fast!!! This review sealed the deal for me - grabbing the iphone 15 pro max! Long time viewer - amped to see how far you've come man, keep em' coming!
Waiting for The 15 pro real day in a life❤
Sorry to be “that guy” - but it’s pronounced “e-kay-uh”. On the plus side, the employees who didn’t let you film there, probably couldn’t pronounce it correctly themselves either.
You are my favorite tech blogger!! Thank you
Like the wallpaper .. where can I get it
Anyone know where to get the thumbnail wallpaper?
Hi. Do you have a link to the wallpaper?
After using it for some time now what would you say about the heating problem
14:58 Mmmmm. Ever heard of Emulators? 👀
the apple youtube channel cant say bad about apple,The iPhone 15 Pro Max, while boasting a sleek design and Apple's signature build quality, disappoints on several fronts. Users have reported overheating problems, making prolonged usage uncomfortable. The fragile glass back is prone to cracking with minimal impact, raising concerns about its durability. Additionally, the display suffers from burn-in issues, impacting the visual experience. Lack of multitasking capabilities and pen support limits productivity, and the absence of fast charging options is a significant drawback. Furthermore, the phone features a large notch, which feels outdated compared to competitors. These issues make the iPhone 15 Pro Max fall short of expectations, especially considering its premium status.

Really awesome video. Good luck with what you do. And I am waiting for more new videos.
What were those things on the wall? They lit up in different colors? Those are so cool
Does it have rumble on ps controller  while playing re village?
Yeah big camera difference great you showed us
Next year the phone will be slimmer where the bezels are etc
anyone can find the wallpaper with the snowy mountains??
0:12 schools boring
On the title picture it says iPhone 15 pro
Man for some reason the bezels look so much smaller on your video than anyone else’s, super nice!  Maybe it’s the screensaver lol
Also the voice isolation is like noise cancelling when you’re on a call you should try it its Sick🙆🏼
I have the 15 pro max and mine is not getting hot. I like the phone
been a fan for a long time bro, keep up the great work. ur one of my fav tech youtubers
6 hours?? My bad samsung s21 laughing at 7-8 hours sot.
Hey where did you get your Apple Watch ultra band from?
walpapers please?
Please make a 15 pro in real day in life
bro needs some window tint on his car
Can you explain what's purpose of little tiny white dot over the small black dot on 15 pro or pro max. Nobody seems to know even apple specialist
Austin can talk?? 😭😭 time goes so fast man
Nice video 👌🏽 but do me a favour and please tell me where you got that Apple Watch band from. It’s looks slick✨👌🏽
“You be dropping yo phone mane.!” LMFAO that shit made me geek out
I’m kinda hyped for this phone because I won’t have to upgrade for years to come lol
I think i need that wallpaper
Very useful review. Thank you and Hi from Ukraine! :)
Where can I get that iPhone wallpaper @UrAvgConsumer? 1:51
You better take lil man to the trampoline park

iPhone 15 pro max finally has usb c let’s gooo!!!
Love the editing!! GREAT WORK =)
I have a iPhone 12 PM and I’m just excited to get the 15 PM with $899 trade in for it so can’t beat it 💯👌🏽
I mean I think that was the best answer ever. lol
What about the heating issue ...i have already ordered iphone 15 pm....but im pretty nervous hearing a lot of negative reviews
Any overheating issues @UrAvgConsumer
Thanks for ur video! Which wallpaper do u use on the 15 pro max? Looks stunning 😍
“If you’re not left handed” let’s gooooo left handed ppl up
For those wondering, the wallpaper shown in the thumbnail can be found in the MyScreen app. Nature category. The app requires a subscription, but there's a 3-day trial period.
Real day in the life ❤ man that amazing and unique 👌🏼
Did you get a new dog 🐶
Great video as usual, Jud... but guys, we should always wear an undershirt... I prefer full tees. It works wonders with our look, but also helps with perspiration.
can you drop it i am sure apple will send you another one.

Living life on the edge without the case
bro holyy little austins grown so much
AFTER LONG time  i'm watching ur vedio
This is How Ari found out Jud had been taking Austin to trampolines and not school😅
The Mindstyle pops are really awesome. I appreciate that there’s always something special about it like metallic or flocked. I’ve only gotten the DC imperial Blacklights and those looks so sick.  Hope you guys are feeling better. Great video!
Where to find the mountain wallpaper
Bruh there are 70+ comments asking for the wallpaper in your thumbnail, please please share a link lol it looks really sick!
If only I could afford one 😢
that iphone is extremely fragile especially the pro max the regular one is stroner and the only titanium in that phone is a really thin exterior there's no titanium inside the phone all aluminum the back glass is hell when it breaks
Where can i get those wallpapers? 3:24
Very underwhelming year, I will wait for the 16pro max.
I hate they moved the speaker button my grandma was used to it how it was
She was obviously headed for the trampoline park. She even showed her confusion for your "School" Statement by scratching her head.🤣😂
Great video!! Can you post a link to the lock screen picture?
Damn the edit with the action button with you changing the location each swipe through the ui very cool imo
need that gaming chip on the iPad.
Lockscreen wallpaper link? 👀
"She ain't want nothing" 😅
You are a great guy and been following your page since the early days and great to see your success and progress... However, in regards to this... Very SOLID? No its not...!  14pro max, 14plus, 13pro max, 12pro max all performed so muchhhhh better and lasted so much longer. Sometimes it was hard to finish the battery on the older models.
Great video as always bro. Def getting the white 3 in1 25w station
I'll stick to my Samsung.  Nice video.
Nice video.  You may want to put a case on that phone.  It cracks really fast on the first drop.
I'm here for that wallpaper 3:01 Can anyone help?
Can you do a real day in the life with the regular 15 Pro?
I was cool until you fell for apples marketing b.s. that you lose no quality when every reviewer has shown that you do.
Good guys, who's got the new 15 pro Max got or felt some unusual heating like they've been reporting?
I ordered the 15 Pro Max in Natural Titanium! Can't wait for it to get here!
Finally upgrading from the XR😅If a smart phone can run AAA games that’s a big enough change for me♥️ sidenote, go, caseless man!! Not having a case on my XR tricked my brain to be more careful with it because you can feel the fragileness😂😂 5 years no cracks🤷🏾
Give us your decision on the Pro Max vs Pro!
Love this secretlab Magnus pro desk, got mine a few weekend ago and can’t live without it now 😅
Always come to your channel with new Apple products keep it up
where did you got the lock screen wallpaper from?
I really enjoy this real day in life videos. It feels like I'm watching a vlog.
guys upgrading from iphone 12 . should i go for an iphoen 14 pro or an 15 pro . poeple be saying abt its over heating issues and durability . and yea i do use an case and screen protector every time
13:50 What about playing the game on the display but using a bluetooth controller?
Finally
Hi boss, could you share where do you get the wall lights? The ones that the can change to orange and teal? Thanks!
That wallpaper is fire
I'm 6'5" and the Pro Max kills my hands. I love the 6.1 display in the pro model.
I just can’t stand how they don’t give a charger block to “reduce carbon footprint” meanwhile they have Chinese workers slaving in sweat shops to build their phones lmfaooo
I need that wallpaper 😩
My boi getting bald quick 🤣👴🏾
Austin is adorable! Great vlog.
Awesome video!!!! What is the name of the monitor you're playing sonic on? And does the stand that allows it to rotate included?
I've been a Samsung user since the notes came out now a fold and flip user. I have iphone for work but I don't think I could ever go back to iphone full time. And I worked for Apple in Germany 🇩🇪
I must really like this channel because this phone is wack and I’m still watching.
i actually prefer the heft of previous pro max models and idc abt the slightly curved edges,  idk why everyone keeps making a big deal abt that, but alas here we are. and not sure why we keep going rounded off to square and back again in and endless cycle, but it’s apple so i can’t be surprised.
Can I get the link for the wallpaper?
Do you have a link for that wallpaper?
Man. He a big boy now. Enjoy it while you can.
Can you make the same video with iphone 15 non pro model
What about overheating issues?
can you share the wallpapers please?
The previous iphones with stainless steel felt like jewellery.
My ip 15 pro max has keystroke delay 😢
I’m upgrading from a 12 Pro… maybe. I’m still undecided and it may just come down to what Verizon will offer me for a trade in. My battery now is meh
Love the wallpaper, where can I get it?
I swear Austin was just a baby lol
Great video thanks for what you do. Would I upgrade my phone hell no. The 15 pro cost so much but such little improvement over the old one.
I've been using samsung phones since 7th grade and now in my 4th year of college. I currently have a S22 Ultra and have been considering getting an iphone 15 pro. Any iphone user have good tips on if i should switch? I appreciate any comments.
Drop iiit?😂 then days off YouTube are over….lol facts😂
one of the best reviewers which really makes every person connect to the device/usage and relate to real life ! thanks !
Could you please give us a download link for that wallpaper on the thumbnail?
2:39 100% me 😂😂 that 13 Pro Max falling on my face feels like getting punched 😂
I almost thought ikea was superstore from verdansk
Wallpaper, please?
Did you notice any overheating on the phone? I’m seeing thes reports pop up… bit concerned…
my 15 pro max battery life is bad 😭
Any overheating issues with yours?
You named your daughter Austin wth 💀
애기 졸귀 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Upgrading from my 14 pro max to the natural titanium pro max because the 14 pro max has very small scuff marks that really bug me.  I’m definitely a fan of some natural metal brushed finishes so the phone stays in good condition.  Hopefully Apple stays with this material or maybe even brings out a ceramic material or something mega durable.  Would love to see a different material on the back of the phone so there’s less glass to break.
Hey Jud, I would expect to have an idea on the battery as well, since you always mention how the battery holds up throughout the day in these type of videos. Thanks
First time catching one of your videos. Gundam photo in your office equals a new sub my brotha.
😂😂😂😂 yes my 14 pro max been hitting my face and head real Hard 😂😂😂. I think That’s the only reason I’ll trade my 14 pro max for the 15 pro max because of the weight.
is that the ikea in philly?
Cute kid
Another day in the life video 😂😂😂
กล้องชัดดีนี่ตัวใหมของไอโฟนล่าสุดนี้
I thought for sure we was going to the trampoline park!!!😢
Trampoline park? 😄
Apple, along with other OEMs, need to stop skimping on the front camera.
The biggest leap i guess is USB C, because of Apple being stubborn, they need lightning because of profit
It's yodravegconsumer
Wallpaper please😅
Is it worth the upgrade?
I need wallpaper pls 😅
I don’t expect to see a load of these 15s on the used market in years to come,
Can you do day in the life with the 15 plus
hi dude. What loop do you have to your AW? Looks good. thanks
Do you have any heating issues with this phone?
Oh s23 ultra takes better photos
My s23 ultra does console games lol 😆 iphone finally had balls put a little better chip on iphone congrats lol s23 ultra is still faster
I'm almost sold on trying an iPhone for the first time.
I was going to switch to iPhone now I won't the style feels so cheap and features I don't care for maybe in couple years I'll switch
I think 14 pro better then 15 😂 I'm not even a iphone user here I'm a Samsung guy
Iphone 15 pro and pro max in my opinion feels so cheap 😂 worth maybe 500
Yea but the drop test sucks on the 15 pro max lol better put a case on this phone after 5 drops it done with lol cheap titanium haha 😂 14 pro is better at dropping at 15 drops over 5 drops lol
Use auto brightness, and use it for navigation is a guaranteed screen burn in! :D Good luck!
New to the channel! Thumbs up for the Charizard 👍🏽👍🏽
Literally it’s the 14 pro max with small changes I love my gold 14 pro max 15 doesn’t even have gold edition
Natural titanium color looks like old people Buick color
what watch strap is on you Apple Watch?
Curious what Apple Watch band your using.
IKEA complaining about someone that was actually putting them on. Wild.
I hate how all the chargers I have from the last couple iPhones are basically trash now when I get the 15 😔
Wow,Nice Quality❤
BOYCOTT IKEA!✊😫
ZESTY. EXTRA ZESTY.
Enjoy your videos, appreciate the content!! What was that cool screen you played sonic on???? 👀😎
I like their idea more instead of school...
Austin was so relatable in the beginning
Where’d you get the background?
Your editing and transitions are amazing 👏
Yes, the first time the 14 pro max landed on my face was the last time I used it in bed 🤣
I just made it in my studio. Tech it out
Bro where those wallpapers from
Think I’ve been watching you for years now nice to see how far you have came 🎉
please share link for that wallpaper. Thanks
Ultra Wide Band chips at 18:49 to help a find a friend hiding behind the bush 😂👌🏼🤦🏻‍♂️
I moved away from Apple years ago after having the same phone year after year. I just found it tedious unfortunately. No personalisation either unlike Samsung. Apples still world behind for me.
It feels the same as the 12,13,14, and probably the 16,17,18 etc.  No ingenuity anymore.  Sorry apple.  Samsung all the way.
Front facing camera looks smudgy/blurry
Call screen is uglyy
Wallpaper please from lock screen
Austin is cute.
wow. feels like yesterday when u are shooting day in the life of 12pro when ur son was born
Where did you get that wallpaper? Looks sick!!!!
Im wanting to upgrade to the 15pro max from the s22 ultra is it worth it
Wallpaper in the thumbnail?
Find friends💀
13:02 dynamic island be like nope I'm not on there
I pre-ordered the iPhone 15 pro max 1TB model is it worth the upgrade from the 13 pro max I have now.
Wallpaper link? 😊
7:15 that school district needs a reward there called education
I hold my iPhone 12 in my palms
Can you do a video on all the 15s thank you
So sick and tired of the make it lighter people. Now the iPhone can feel cheap just like Android phones. Ridiculous!
Really great video. I haven’t seen too many vlog style reviews. Very entertaining and I’m definitely going to get the 15 pro max 👍🏾
Wow he’s so big already
Love the wallpaper on the thumbnail. Can it be obtained online?
What’s that monitor you played sonic on? And how long is your chain?
Great video awesone phone 👍👍
Awww, I think you should have taken him to the trampoline park. 😂
definitely curious to see how the blue titanium withstands scratches over time. I'm a huge fan of the blue color but its longevity with the PVD coating has me a little concerned
Imagine kids were in charge 😂
I think the action button is perfectly placed. On one hand it’s not that quick and easy to reach with one hand but yet it’s better than going into the phone for it.  On the other hand, when we hold our phones in hand 🖐️ our grip is usually around the bottom of the phone . So imagine the action button being on the bottom of the phone where it can easily be accidentally pressed kinda like how Bixpy was.
Hello. I like that  setup you have in the gray room (@3:00). Can you do a vid on how to do that room deco and desk setup please??
where you get that wallpaper
The doggie is the best part of the iPhone
Amazing video, btw, where can i get those epic walpapers?
Wallpaper please?
He’s getting so big bro wow! God bless. We all should be going to a trampoline park instead of work. 😂😂
I find my iPhone 15 pro max overheats at wire charging. Is it always the case?  I didn’t had the problem at PD charging before with previous iPhones
Is resident evil out? I thought the game was coming out on October 30th?
THIS is the review I needed 🙌🏼
Ain't it funny when the s23 was lighter they said it felt cheap and the 14pm felt premium now its lighter there saying its better
If you have a second iphone 15 pro max or a dummy model, you should do a drop test on the two. It will be interesting to see the integrity between the two models. Also, actually weighing the two.
love men
Triple tap on the back is my flashlight n dbl is my camera 📷
Lens flare is still there, but just a little less. Definitely still there. I noticed it, even on this video. Hopefully by 16 pro or 17 pro at the latest, they sort it out
Where do you get your wallpapers?
Good review thank you ❤
if your shirt is grey then im color blind
Where did you find the wallpaper?
Love the video! I’m looking into the 15 Pro. Think you can do a real day in the life with the 15 Pro?
Damn 15 second adds at the start has to click off
Wait, where is resident evil village on the App Store? I can't find it
Does understand yet that you make YouTube videos?
Use the 5x lens then convert it to portrait photo.. insane quality and I shoot with a sony A7IV with sigma 105mm 1.2
When are we gonna get a new MicroCenter vid brother? And a new shopping challenge? How about a shopping challenge for the kids? There’s a lot of kid focused tech out there I’m sure you and Arie know that of course; but a shopping challenge and giveaway for parents the way you guys used to do would be awesome…
Check the Mous Intralock case. Suits the colors of your Tesla
I prefer iPhones to be a lil on the heavier side.. The 14 Pro is a good size and weight.   Gives the phone a much more premium feel..
Yep. The pinky strain was real. I downsized from a 13 Pro Max to a 15 Pro.
Can i get this wallpaper please?😊
I also like a heavier phone it feels much better in the hand..for me the sweet spot would be keep the heavier stainless steel but do the slight rounder edges of the new iPhone 15..that would be perfect
Battery life that you got is what you usually knock android phones on. Funny how it’s ok on the iPhone for you.
Battery drains to fast
What’s the watch band you are using?
I have my 12 Pro Max with 9 hours average screen time.. And the battery is at 84% health (max capacity). Not impressed.
Yeahhhh aiiiiii bruh 24 hr battery life my ahhh
the iphone 16 will blow the doors off this phone.
Great review
This video feels more lifestyle flex then an iPhone review.
Bring back the Mini Apple !
battery life is not impressive at all. 13pm is giving me 8hr SOT
10:03 THESE TRANSITIONS THOUGH!!! 🤩🤩🤩
I never liked the thick bezzles on the iphone 14 pro max, simply because other phones were way ahead displaywise. Now with the iphone 15 pro max's display looking way better, i might consider getting it
WTF camera video in car and also flower photo look awful...
Drop it. I dare you.
Shout out to Thunder E

Share the lockscreen wallpaper you sport please.
Damn that wallpaper. Where did you get it?
Bro needs to start answering his calls xD
comparing bezels, it is noticable bcus 14pro max ur holding has black aluminum frame+bezels
@uravgconsumer get me a ipone15 pro max
Austin is a paid actor 😅
The man has 3 million subscribers and he’s concerned about his screen… how? Just how is this man followed by so many? Mate! You put a screen protector on the strongest mobile phone screen?
Where can I get that wallpaper with the mountain?
You have 29.000 Mails
lol no case and a screen protector is the way to go.
Great video 🎉
playing xbox cloud games with the app in this phone will be so perfect on a train or sumthing.
The 15 pro max has done worse in drop tests than the 14 pro max. Jerryrigeverything broke the back glass of the 15 pro max just by bending the phone.
J Awesome Video and the little ones are getting so big fast.Thanks so much for sharing .✌️💯
Where can I get the wallpapers ?
Why AREN'T you going to a trampoline park?
What "AvgConsumer" has a dedicated streaming room in addition to their office? LOL congrats though honestly goddamn
talks about bezels like he never seen a phone with it.. someone out there give him the S23 ultra.. 4 minutes talking about it. high deal in 2023 for him..
Those transitions when showing off the action were clean ngl. I have the 14 pro max and I think I’m just going to wait until they reduce or take off the dynamic island. I’m a bit jealous of the smaller bezels though.
My iphone xr still gives 6hr of battery life 😂
When are you going to put ubiqui in your house
Love seeing how your family has grown over the years, God bless you all! Great review as always!
We need day in the life with iPhone 15
This shit costs $1927 in India
Do with base models
Its funny how iPhone users say iPhones are better thn Samsung phones but yet are years behind Samsung lol. Tht “action button” Samsung been done tht years ago.
Can anyone tell me where can we get wallpaper he showa in the video PLISSSSSSSS
Can you do one with the regular iPhone 15 Pro?
yes you can thank the EU for usb c on the iphone
@11:33 did the apple logo light up?
It looks like a little iPad pro.
link on the wallpaper please
Hey Apple folks welcome to the USB C life🔥
I went to check the 15 pro max and rest of other 15 phones but wasn’t too impressed. They are just like yesteryear’s phones. The design isn’t too different despite having titanium and usb c. I have 12 pro so it would be a big jump however it’s nothing innovative in terms of new technology. I’ll probably be getting 15 pro max but I won’t rush due the reasons above. Would be my early Christmas gift to myself 😅 🎁
Hermosa nena
No case with apple care is the way to go
What’s type of charging cable was that 11:36 where it showed the wattage? Got a link?
Hey 👋🏾. I’ve gotta know…Is there a link to your watch band and AirPods Pro case??
Where did u get the wallpaper?
I like this man awesome man.
Where can I find the wallpaper on the right at 3:48 and 12:01
❌would love to see a real day in the life with the regular pro model✅ not everybody will go for the big big pro max...plz make one video with the regular pro if possible ✅
I like the trampoline park idea personally
get hot as hell on calls
Great review! By the way, anyone know where to get a copy of his wallpaper?
Can you give me the iphone 14 wallpaper please?
I’m going to sit on the fence. There are reports about overheating issues and poor battery performance, and most likely battery degradation over time, because of how hot the 15 Pro runs.
Lots of valuable information on the 15 which i have  ordered  but not received yet  Love listening to you explain. You have such a nice voice to listen to
Austin was like "why do I need to go to school when a new phone came out?"
Is Austin a boy or a girl ?
It’s not worth buying
I remember when you and Ari had just gotten married and now you both have two kids and the videos just keep getting better keep it up man
I ordered mine on Wednesday but I gotta wait till October for it to arrive 😭
"Trampoline park?" Good try, little man. Good try.
I went to apply store and  compared my iPhone 11 and the 15 camera and I can’t even tell the difference
Great video but honestly can’t wait until the video listing other accessories and tech from the video. That XDR display gaming was awesome. The other thing I am very interested in but no sure if it will be included in the other video is what is that wall mounted tv/display in the streaming room? The CB one on the wall to the right of you are facing the nanoleaf lights.
Very boring
Man your wallpapers😭
@2:34 Man, hell yea! 😂
Austin said the trampoline park!!! LOLOLOL
A naked iPhone in a parking lot 😮 any phone breaks if if falls in a Parking lot. But nice video.
The stainless steel side frames of the iPhone 14 Pro Max are better. Can't notice the weight difference but then again I lift weights. It's a slight change if you hold one at a time in your hand and slightly toss it up.
I finally saw all of the iPhone 15 Pro Max colors in person and the Blue Titanium is the most Underrated color. The best one in my opinion. Natural is light grey and the sides look silver.
wow your kid got big
my boi is in shape! the lats showing through the shirt and bulky arms😩🤙
The beginning was great. Same thing my son does 😂
You better watch Jerry rig, everything and everything apple pro before not rocking it with a case
Man I remember when there was no crew. It was jud the one man army. So happy for you man and ur amazing family. I sure hope to build something beautiful for myself as well. You are a true example of hustle and I thank you having us on the ride.
Where did you get your screensaver in this video for your 15 promax
Nice video. Thanks for the real world battery life experience .
That wallpaper need that link 🔥
which screen protector?
Might as well connect iphone to monitor and play triple A games on a bigger screen with a controller.
3:23 it is low key like Champaign gold if light hits it a certain way
austin is so adorable, new sub
People be spending upwards to $400.00 for minimalist/dumb phones (looking at you Light Phone) when you can just turn an iPhone into a dumb phone. Phone app, Safari+Folder+Settings on dock...bam there you go...your iPhone is now a "Light" phone.
I usually bypass the case as well. I may get the arc pulse case though, so that I can lay my phone on it's back. However, It's a bit overpriced for what you get.
The one thing I need from this video IS UR LOCK SCREAN  THAT SHI IS 🔥
im falbbergasted less light flair and some moved around screen buttons is this fucking guy for real or what
uravgapplefuckboy more like
I’m 11 hours in of normal use and I’m at 10%. A bit disappointed with the battery so far honestly
Those days of YouTube are over😂😂
I need that wallpaper pls
I never used a case on my 12 pro max and never cracked it. Just very slight blemish on one of the corners. The 15 pro max just feels so good in my hand. I'm not getting a case but I did put a screen protector on it.
I think for the next iPhone 16 the notch will be gone,...and apple will say its a great upgrade again......just like the usb-c
Anyone knows where to get the wallpaper he is using?
Anyone know the wallpaper he’s using?
You should wait for iPhone 16 pro max
Excuse me, do people really believe Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil won't be ports and will be the full deal from the PS5?  Just look at the size and heat generated and strees on the hardware that's generated by thise games on a PS5 or Xbox Series X, I am afraid that if you think those exact games will run flawlessly on an iPhone right now, you are delusional man.
Really brilliant job.
I think the 15 pro is better for more one hand use .the 15 pro max I like it to but u need 2 hands for it .on the 15 pro u can take a pic with one hand .on the 15 pro max u have to use 2 hands .
few people are going to rock it naked.. and it doesn't feel as premium.  let's be real, not worth it as an upgrade.
"Cryo boost" 🤣 Is that what they call years old tech?🙈 I have this on a very old Samsung wireless wharger.
Where did you get that beautiful wallpaper??😍
Great vid. Could I get the link to the wallpaper on the thumbnail please?
Dang Austin grow up so fast !! And now he talks 😱😱.dude kids grow up so fast 😃🤘🏾
My 14 plus beats this 15 pro max on battery. I get more than 8 hours screen on . Battery life is of importance to me; if im to upgrade, I would go for the 15 plus
Ok. I gotta ask what that wallpaper is.
ngl this the review i was waiting for. 💯
drop all the wallpaper links pls :O
I wonder if J or other employees gets to Live in the office/house. Super dope house to not be lived in.
Trampoline park 😂😂😂 Austin doesn’t want to go to school
15 pro next ❤
apps should get directly access to the action button interface. That apple only provides 9 functions, is really sad.
Could you please share your wallpaper from your iPhone 14 pro? It looks awesome.
Iphone 15 Pro max user here. First day, And the battery is ass. Dont let all the reviews on youtube fool you.
We want the phone to be more than what it is…. A phone. It doesn’t matter how you slice it it’s never what we hope to have fulfilled. A device to help us in our everyday life.
Switched from a S22 Ultra to the 15 Pro Max & I’m loving it so far the battery is so much better
Trampoline park was better lol😂
The weight and size reduction  plus usbc is a definite upgrade.
Probably the only crazy mufucka lookin at the quality of that Tee 😂😂 where u get that from my boy I need to order some
The 14 pros also had a 2k peak brightness
I’m with Austin, I feel like a trampoline park would have been better
Was definitely thinking the action button should’ve went under the volume rocks or even the power button
For the love of god read your emails!
Gray beard hair… if you’re getting old, I’m getting old 😭
eekea… not eyekea… 😅
Play GeForce now on it u will have a lot of fun
They need to add a number row to their keyboard
Dang she wants to go to a trampoline park haha how cute
Your son is so cute bro ❤
How are you measuring the screen on time since your last full charge? I hate how Apple doesn’t tell you that specific metric in the battery settings.
How's the battery life on the 15 Pro Max? Is it better than 14 Pro Max? Thinking of getting either 15PM or 14PM, but I'm leaning towards whichever has the best battery life
Slow usb c is a bummer
i have the iPhone 12 Pro and the back is very slippery. is the 15 pro max less slippery on the back?
Anyone watching on the 15 pro or pro max? How much is the dynamic island cutting in for y’all in landscape mode?
I think you should’ve went to the trampoline park
It’s weird to me that based on the drop test, this is one of the weaker phones. They seem to crack from the back 1st along with the cameras. Strange really. I’d figure it would be more resistant. I ordered a chunky UAG case.
So roughly he got about 13_14hours of average use for an average customer.. so overall I'm going to say yes Apple is one of the best phones if not the best phone for battery life and it all depends on what you're juicing on your phone...  But the worst problem I think it's going to have is it's charging speed  I'm still saying it takes Apple a long time to fully charge an iPhone..  I haven't seen any videos yet for charging speeds   Normally the iPhone pro Max from last year takes 0 to 100% in 1 hour 48 minutes   compared to Samsung 0_100 percent in 1 hour ish... So I guess Samsung wins in the fast charging department for now anyways.   Or you can get other Android phones that charge 0 to 100 percent In under 20_30 minutes....
Blue is the best
Thanks a lot for your experience! Good luck!
Idk man, after watching jerryrig snap the back glass by barely doing anything, it really makes me nervous about the longetivity of this iphone.
That light grey titanium is beautiful but the black is definitely more masculine.
iPhone 15 Pro Max 😍
Such a sweet girl...😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Nice video,peace bro!👊🏾
Needs to be in and out of the pocket more for a real world review. Feel like you never let it go. Watching JerryRigs phone back shatter with a bit of pressure, makes me wonder what it would be like in a pocket for time doing stuff.
Your dog is sooooooo cute!
I would like to get hands on this wallpaper! Love your videos by the way. 🫡
What I didn't know you had another son, but congrats on having two now lol
Wallpaper?
1:29 hmm….a grey Herman
my 15 pro max  was supposed to be delivered Friday but never showed up
Where you gettin these mf wallpapers🔥
There was a glare on the Iphone 15 as well.
When does he talk about battery
Am i the only one who tries to never play games on his iphone for much time continuously or any heavy games at all? I feel like that battery health can be destroyed so easily. There is no chance i will play for example call of duty or resident evil.
Let’s change the name b you no longer the average consumer lol
Guys if someone know the wallpaper please tell me, Thanks. Great video!
I hate how the batteries in old iPhones degrade with the new updates. I charge my phone to 100 and unplug before bed. Usually around 10pm and wake up with 98-100% still. Since iOS 17 I wake up with 92% or so. And it drains quicker through out the day.
Who the hell has 458 missed calls?
Nice ❤
Where can I download the lockscreen wallpaper that was shown on the iPhone 14 at 3:49?
Can we get a IPhone 15 vs galaxy S23 video?
what's the wallpaper?
Straight up! Apple should have made the action button selectable for either side. Right now it works best for left handed people!💯
Where can I get your nice iPhone wallpapers? They look so sick 😮
11:28 speak for ur self I didn’t want it. I want lightning.
Your daughter is so cute! 0:08
Austin wants to go to the Trampoline park. Why not ? Let's get  it 😊
I’ve heard avg consumer don’t care about 120Hz!!
Upgrading annually is pointless😂
😂 way bro said to the trampoline park
I want the pro max for the gaming
Great content as usual .. curious to know from where are the bracelet and ring you are wearing they are fire .
Great review!
How do we get the wallpaper??
How is the color in comparison to the watch ultra?
Austin wanted to play hooky 😂
What cable is that showing the wattage?
Anyone know where to get his phone wallpaper?
Just got my iPhone 15 Pro Max in Natural Titanium from the Apple Store. I'm switching from my Samsung Galaxy S10+ to the iPhone since I never owned an iPhone, the 15 PM is much heavier than my S10+ just a little bit. I just need to set it up but will need to contact or go to my carrier to get the eSim.
Thank you for taking us “Melanated” folks into consideration with your camera test shots.
Isn't the battery life that impressive unless it was completely on 4G/5G? Then it's fine. On WiFi with normal use, I easily achieved 7h30 - 8 hours with the S23 ultra.  I see in videos that the iPhone would be better, but as I said, what if this was largely via WiFi? Then the S23 Ultra should not be inferior at all.
Yes sir what I been waiting for 🍿🥤👏🏾
man we’re gettin old  he’s got a little guy goin to school too used to be a day in the life kicking off with some toy runs or somethin
0.5mm aramid fiber (similar to carbon fiber) cases are all that I’ve been using for the past few years. Hardly can feel there’s a case in your phone. I want the closest thing to no case as possible.. aramid fiber is super strong and won’t break like plastic when dropped
Selfie camera color washed out especially skin details...
Love the wallpaper on your previous iPhone (on the left) @ 3:49! Link to where I can get that? Thanks
Always look forward to your day in the life. Great job
The last iPhone I have is the 13 pro Max, Apple removed the option of swapping the SIM card. No more iPhone for me.
Lol he tried!!!!  😅Maybe he thought dad was trying to have a fun day?
Best content on the 15 series so far on the tube 👏
Just saw a video of the 15+ beating out the 15 Pro and 15Pro Max four battery life
not a trampoline park!! 😭😭 you better take him after school!
Didn’t know you had another son already. Congrats
Can I ask what MagSafe iPhone stand and Apple Watch charger are you rocking at 4:33? I like it! 🔥
Bro, you should get the Arc Pulse case and do a review on it. It’s like going naked while still having protection.
The boys man! So much love the little fellas. A man's dream. Excellent day in the life review with this one. Turning my attention to Google to see if they have enough make me go back to the Pixel since I left the 6 Pro for the S22 Ultra. It's either that or the 15 Pro Max. External recording alone(although limited to Pro Res for now) along with being able to use my phone with my Windows PC is enough breathing room to comfortably use iOS for me.
Where does he get all this money to live like that at such a young age?
How do u like your Tesla plaid ?
Disappointed Apple  dropped the ball was looking for something  significant to make me upgrade from the 14 pro max
You could still see the lens flare on the 15 😂😂
Well, you gotta take the kid to the trampoline park now lol
Man austin grew fast.i remember when he was still a little baby . Feels like it was a few months ago
Can you kindly share the wallpaper?
Wallpaper please? 1:52
Can you please do the same with 15 pro. I'm concerned about it's battery life
Take that boy to a trampoline park
Link to wallpaper please.
You’re brave to not put a case on that phone.  I have always wanted to attempt that but I know as soon as I do that disaster will happen.
What screen protector do you use?
Snapchat messed all up on the 15PM i noticed
great video. going from an 11 pro to a 15 pro max, think i made the right choice.
You see those beams of lights that’s just my astigmatism lol
im a contracter and write emails to my supervisors all day so ill be mapping the action button to send emails to them quickly. had an iphone 11 pro max and tmoblile is giving me $1000 trade in for it so ill be getting the base model 15 pro for free
Are you the guy that had that interview with Candace Owen’s ? If only seen clips of it but you sound and look just like him
Been waiting for this one!! Little one is super cute also!
Wallpaper please🥰
link to that background at 1:50? Looks🔥!!
You definitely ain’t no average consumer lol…
Please share that background ?
Give it only 5 more years, and iPhone will be at Android 2018 level.  Apple are on a roll, don't hate them, they're really trying hard these days.  Props to them.
I enjoyed your review.  Yep! Titanium is gray. I first saw titanium, while working in quality assurance, when I was on the Boeing 727 production line.  It was the new pricey wonder metal.
those wallpaper where i can get that
The action button placement does make sense. In the S9 with bixby button (remapped to flashlight), it was in the middle of the phone so there wasnt any more adjustment needed.  Also wondering if the iPads will get the same games since i believe theyre still more capable.
What grinds my effin gear is the placeholder for the word iPhone 15 Pro Max, but instead we got a mini dynamic island
Trampoline park 😂😂😂 got em
The Action button segment, with the slideaways...amazing! was that from the original apple presentation or did UrAvgConsumer make them?!?! Either way, fantastic
Nice! This is the innovation I was looking for from some. Looks totally different from last year too!
UrAvgConsumer:- saying there is really a noticeable difference Me:- me watching in 4k thinking this isn’t sufficient enough to see the difference🗿
Dope video and love the Charizard!!!
Had my first day with it yesterday, barely charging it now 😅
@10:32 i see that Haworth Fern chair! And the Embody!
Your average consumer... right 😂
where can i get the iPhone 15 wallpaper you are using ?
Love the new 15 pro max, but Austin is the star❤️❤️❤️
Hey question where can I find those cool wallpapers that you have on you phone thank you
Yes!!! I’ve waited for this video 🎉
If anything the iPhone 15 Pro has me very excited for the next iPad Pro because you already know it’s gonna push all those things forward, gaming especially!
Can you sent wallpaper here from your iPhone 😊
Don’t drop it from waist level on the back! I’ve already seen 2 videos and it shattered on the first drop.
Waiting for my pro max pre order, it’s very disappointing seeing all the reports how fragile these phones are.
15 pro max vs go pro 12 which one should I buy
0:12 way to ruin his day lol
“She didn’t want nothin” 😂😂 so relatable to that 😂😂😂☠️
First day in the life on iPhone 15 in the YouTube
This phone looks fire, but I’m scared the battery is going to be worse then my 13 pro max, on my specific model the battery isn’t as great as everyone else says they get on theirs. But the design is so sick in my opinion, and the camera looks amazing, although I don’t think it’s that much better than the 13 pro max. But because my 13 pro max model has touchscreen issues and the battery is starting to suck, I’m planning on making a switch. I’m torn between the 15 plus or 15 pro max. Any help
Thank you for the great  insight and answering a number of questions I had outstanding.
Lmao man this guy never has anything negative to say about iPhones. We get it bro you don’t stray away from apple. 😂
I pre ordered the pm 15 delivery date was about mid October n then yesterday they finally open up pick up available n was available to pick one up guess the benefits of waking up at 4 for work lol
The battery life is feeling like my old 12 Pro max
The Pixel’s camera is the best for dark skin people. Apple’s AI is caucasian-leaning. Four years ago it did not recognize Black people as people 🤷🏾‍♂️
Which application is that you edited pro log footage
Whats up nigg4
The video cinematography is ON POINT. When he swiped through the Action Button preferences at 10:03, that was genius!!
Apple script in this video? Or I skip it ?
Need that sick wallpaper!
Bro brought a whole new phone for the action button. What a waste of money 😂
No one will make me switch from iPhone front selfie cam still undefeated
Like always appreciate the effort and love the vid
😂 where he get Trampoline Park from?
Thai guy LGBQT ?
Does he have the same car as MKBHD?
Never rock a case, join us

Damn you quick with it this time 😂 Bro he growing fast asf congrats again
Feels better for sure !!!! Can’t judge battery yet !! Otherwise same Apple release same but different
cute baby...
Whoa, the office gives me nostalgia vibes because it’s almost the exact layout of they’re old apartment when they were on the come up!
Austin: "oh we going to school", killed me😂😂😂
The most unique and "average" way of reviewing a gadget that will be people's daily life. Thumbs up!!! 👍
Link to both of the wallpapers at 3:50?
I have a iPhone 13pro do you think it's worth me upgrading at this time ?
Is pro max too big for average daily usage?
طفله صغيره لكنها توادي دور كبير ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
32 min
Why there is a Dynamic Island at the top right hand corner 😂
its important for people to note that using data and taking videos / photos drains battery much faster than just using Youtube at home on WiFi.  Battery life on the 13 pro max that I own is incredible at home, but out and about on data or doing Pokemon Go I go from 10 hrs SOT to around 5-6
You can tell he likes being a father 😎
Hey. I enjoyed the video. Thanks for the content and hard work.
Been subbed to you since 100 k glad to see my man continue to create dope content 🤘🏿
0:12 you began to sound like Will Smith 😂
Yo los key this video got me wanting more Vlogs
Sounds crazy but iphone 15 plus has better battery than the pro max
i am really disappointed with this battery is the A17 pro chip that strong if so i don't want all of it's power to do most of the things i need
Where did you get your wallpaper? 🔥
Can you please do a day in the life with the regular 15pro?
🔥🔥🔥🔥 great content
Battery life doesn't seem that good
He’s getting so big. Love to see how you incorporate the family in your reviews at times. One of my favorite reviewers
Omg he got so big I remember him as a baby omg 😱
Thanks for the video,always great !! Your child has grown !!
His videos made my childhood he's the reason why I love tech
Totally unrelated but I love that jacket you’re wearing!
wo if your kid's already old enough to go to school, it really means I'm getting old, and I'm only 29, lol 🤣
You’re fearless,no case?clearly you haven’t seen Zack’s video 😂
