Woman man, I swear.. they cant go out in public without adult supervision jeez 😂
I would have gone back and punched her
Whats the matter Miss ? ......I hurt my Skeleton on a Peleton.......
Saturday September 6th 2025😊
When you're not only stupid, but totally brainless as well. I cannot accept the fact that she made it onto adulthood being that absolutely brainless. She didn't perfect her dismount. She gets zero.
Great response time by the announcer
off course it's a woman.
Peloton is as peloton does.. we are the "together" people, one in all in. 🚴
Yep my name was on Tony Martins shirt 🚴‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Typical 👎
Did she got flogged?
Eeek.. she was busy being a pickme and holding a sign out for the front running camera..  poor cyclists!!
I hope she got arrested
u know exactly what type of person this is, just looking at that goofy outfit.
A lot of bikers got badly injured including broken bones, and over half a million dollars of damage was done. People need to get serious consquences for stupidity like this, or it will keep happening.
Looks like a scene on family guy.
hilarious
The power of cardboard!
This is why many riders have quit completely. Spectators getting in the way.
500k in bike damages medical bills etc
Jail for stupidity
Jail for stupidity
Cars lol
she wanted to be on camera, and now her life is screwed in front of millions
Or maybe, just dont all cycle so close to each other 😂😂
That stupid look on her stupid face.
She is also being questioned now about the Space Shuttle Challenger
I've hit a deer on a motorcycle and remained upright. How does a 1 lb piece of cardboard take down a 150 lb man?  Still tragic how
There's idiot...then sign holders on race tracks
Stupid people being stupid.
Typical democrat causing a train wreck that will affect people's lives forever.
Many of them aren't spectators. They're obstacles.
And of course it's the least athletic -looking woman that caused this. That slap on the wrist fine is not nearly enough to cover the damage she caused by trying to get on camera
They should have fined her for the damage to the bikes at least. Probably over $50,000
Safety and security organizers are the real culprits . She is just s-t-u-p-i-d , not a crime huh !
Name and shame
This crash is kind of like a Daytona/Talladega NASCAR big one crash.
Bimbo feminist
The fact that she was only fined 1200€ is criminal indeed.
As a racer/rider, Tony Martin was largely to blame for this.  He could have easily used his right arm to brush that lady's sign and her arm out of the way rather than let it cause him to crash. That rest entirely on him and it was easily avoidable as we can see that he saw it far in advance.  Fk Tony Martin.
They should have it so everyone has tonstay behind a line so far back.  I've just watched a few different cyclists videos of a person on the sidelines making them crash 🙄
Did anyone ever figure out who she is?
That’s Waldo!!! Take a close look!
Isn’t I funnyfuunn  OSAaa woma woman
I’m not even a cycling fan and this is infuriating
This is the kind of thing Mr. Bean would do.
0:30-0:42
A fan ? Actually a troublemaker .
This is why my riding group is capped at 8 per bunch .
Umm yeah, she blatanlty had the sighn in the middle of there way, with lit no room, so she either did it on purpose, or she is that out of it, either way, she should be permanetly banned, thats crazy
Is she arrested?
I'd be off quick march😩🙈🙊
That women with the sign 🪧 made it look like an accident 🤔
Sometimes it takes so little to cause a disaster. I'm not even sure I want to know what people did to that woman after her identity was found out...
She surrendered 2 days later and was ultimately given a 1200€ fine
Only interesting part of this shit race
If school fixed stupidity, then tell me what is this?
Omg thats crazy😥
Her afterwards: hehehehehhe whoooopsie:3
Hope she got time for that.  what an asshole
she was only fined 1200 euros, despite all of the carnage, injuries and damages that she caused. that isn't justice, she should face REAL consequences for her actions.
Question:  What happens when you step out onto the road and stick your arm out to block a group of cyclists?  Could that cause a crash?  Did you do what you did even though you KNEW the group of bicycles were coming?  That's all we need to know to assess premeditation.
Can't believe this woman could be so dumb.
One of the most enjoyable moments I’ve seen
I personally think something like this deserves jail time, even if it's like 1 week or 1 month at maximum. It could've killed someone or even more than 1 person. Because it's so reckless and egoistical.
"Shouldn't have been there in the first place" I agree, the cyclists should not have been there in the first place. because Bicycles do not belong on the roads. Roads are for cars, and trucks, and other _motorized_ vehicles, not outdated technology that lets you feel smug for something abysmally stupid.  Go to a track, get off the road you road hogs.
She must be prosecuted for this
The even more famous because it
Wasn't there a manhunt for this woman.    What happened. To her.......
Has anyone identified the sign holder? She must be severely punished.   Anyone I hope the riders who were affected by the stupidity of the sigh holder were okay.
Well that was a very stupid thing to do by the spectator.
I guess the entire Peloton team is not very good.
That's hilarious, you can't beat seing cyclist on the floor!! True KARMA!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this illustrates one of the reasons I no longer watch the Tour, spectators and bad behavior.
Silly man
manslaughter at the least.
Cant believe why spectators keeps doing this
Npc glitching in the road
French intelligence
Cyclist over reacted.
The fan was fined 1200 euros.
What does poster say ? At 0:49 that dude or chick caused whole this mess 😂😂😂. Damn I hope no one get serious injuries
+1 to the fan. Where thousands have failed, you have succeeded in making cycling entertaining, albeit momentarily.
Look at Me Me, me, me ….
The slowmo's are beautiful 😂 i enjoy these fallings
People like that should be arrested and locked up for a year to teach them a lesson!
Idiot. Throw her ass in jail and don’t feed her until she realizes what she has done. She’ll starve.
She was sentenced to pay a fine of 1200 Euros. That's not even one of those damaged bikes.
It's only fair her life was effectively ruined over this.
It wasn't a spectator it was Joe Biden.
Looked like a liberal
Karma for not paying road tax.   Hardy Har Har
How stupid can you be! I get so angry every time I see this. 🤬 No respect at all for cyclists. Luckily no one died! She was found and fined for this horrific crash.
so, did she got jail time?
An example : presedent needs to he set *PUNISH* no questions asked !!!!!!!!!!!!
Jedes Jahr springt ein neuer NoBrainer aus der Reihe
Hope the only remains of that person is a dislocated skull
OPI omi fault
Bradley wiggins is the fakest so called 'champion' of all time ....a Disgrace !!
Freaking Touron (tourist moron)
Kann man diesen Schild-Hoch -Halter nicht ausfindig machen und haftbar machen für diesen Unfall? 🤔🤔🤔🤔 Unglaublich was sich „Fans“ heutzutage alles erlauben und das ohne Konsequenzen tragen zu müssen. Wenn ich auf diesem Video den Verursacher erkannt hätte, weil er zu meinem Bekanntenkreis/Freundeskreis gehört, würde ich nicht zögern ihn anzuzeigen. Bei diesem Massensturz hätte wer weiß was alles passieren können.
Based
Men
They look so silly
This announcer really loves using the word peloton
I HATE this kind of stupidity. Legitimately pisses me off.
This incident was the most stupid and totally unnecessary accident in all the 50+ years ive watched " The Tour de France". However whenever I see idiotic fans running along side these amazing athletes my heart is in my mouth. One small trip could lead to disaster for somebody.
To say it in a civil matter .. It would be interesting to measure the average IQ of all the people standing besides the track.
Plot twist- She sued the cyclist for breaking her signboard. hahaha
She deserves to rot in hell. They suffered their whole lives to be there and she crushed their hopes and dreams, and made them mentally worse to continue riding.
At least some got through.
For anybody who is wondering about the punishment for the sign holding woman: "The spectator, a 31-year-old woman who has not been publicly identified, was found guilty by a criminal court in Brest of reckless endangerment and involuntarily causing injuries.  The woman, who stepped onto the road during the race and had her back to the cyclists, was fined 1,200 euros, or about $1,350 — far less than the maximum penalties she was facing.  The charges under consideration carried a possible one-year prison term and a fine of €15,000. At the woman’s trial, in October, prosecutors requested a four-month suspended prison sentence. She did not have a previous criminal record."
Did that joke got arrested at least?
The organizers did not check the security by posting guards on the road.  There are no measures to protect the players, and it is not just a spectator problem.
What happened to her after?
"Stupidity of a fan" exactly what I was waiting to hear. A lot of stupid fans in TDF actually.
Stupid fan
All she had to do was take a few steps away from the cyclists and everything would have been fine.
The stupid fan who caused this crash should be named and shamed and pursued for all eternity. She must pay.
she did that on purpose
Class
Are bikers like dumb or something? Like nobody NOBODDDYYYY saw her and couldn't yell MOVE! before they slammed into her? Smh i swear its like they all drive with their heads looking down. Smh 🤦‍♂️ also she's an idiot and should be charged something.. idk what, but something..
Ab heute hat die Dummheit einen Namen. Wie heißt diese Frau? Und die ganze Welt ist schockiert wie dumm eine einzelne Frau sein kann.
'Go grandma and Grandad!' wtf
She assaulted like 40+ people, interfered in a public sporting event, public disobedience, negligence. She's lucky to only get a fine.
I think she should be fined enough to buy 100 kids bicycles.
She was only fined 1.2k euros for this. This is how we are as a society, far too soft on punishment. Don’t be surprised if this happens again.
This lady opi omi is a model person for understanding modern France.😎
😡
She just went Dinoco is all mine
Stunning and Brave
She is why your Vehicle Manual tells you not to drink motor oil.
This is a metaphor for feminism and female voters ruining western civilisation
Bring back the guillotine!
This is so awesome, get him an award 😂😂😂😂
was she put in jail for 25 years ?
Some would say that this woman needs to be strung up. Who is she, what is her address? Any volunteers?
Red Flag! Red Flag! Watch your delta
They went down like dominos.
Allez Opi Omi
Que jumenta!! 😡🤬
Lol so funny
The most hated person for 4 weeks
It always seems to be a woman causing these incidents
ROADSIDE FANS ARE THE WORST CAUSES OF RUINED CYCLING CAREERS! 😡
Why would they people that close to the road?! Don’t they know how retarded people can be?!
Total matador move - my money is she/he/they/them are making a beeline for Pamplona…
Most the idiot things in past years have almost all come from adults we literally hold children to higher standards than we do adults
the modern left in a nutshell
what a worthless pos
Good girl
there will be always a fucking idiot somewhere....
Give her a free ticket to the next Daytona 500. Front row seat?
I think the sign says.."I will f*ck everything up"
A fan decided to be cute in front of camera and caused the disaster.
I'll probably go to hell for this, but I found it pretty hilarious 😂the whole thing just looks so ridiculously stupid
20 cyclists going down is not the entire pelotón.
But she didn't cause the ENTIRE pelotón to crash. Many were help up and maby were in front who didn't crash. Everyone did not crash. FFS.
Woman moment.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, but some people abuse the privilege
Are women or some category of ppl just spatially non intelligent? there are more than just this case... like you're foot is on the edge of the road and the cardboard sticks out from your foot.. sptial awareness anyone???
NOWHERE NEAR all of them at all, more bs.
Imagine actually being French
There is no defence against stupidity ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
Athletes with years of dedicated training, a yokel with a scrawl on piece of cardboard, the worst crash ever in Tour de Frances history, broken athletes everywhere and the yokel Only fined 1,200 euros: Priceless ;)
I've never watch Tour de France, but Wow....! I cannot believe almost everyone got hurt very badly by a moronic fan for holding her sign.  Though im glad they're ok, but im also glad "THAT" fan was arrested for ruining this event.
did this dumb B ever get caught?
Women
que sucede asi con la persona que perjudica la carrera??
hopefully the signe is allright
Couldn't have planned that better myself!  Shame she missed the first couple of cyclists.
Punishment is for him to lay on the ground and lets all the bikes run him over 1 by 1.
What's crazy is they decided it will be fenced off from now on but you can still go watch the World Rally championship amd stand out in the way of rally cars doing 150+ mph and jumping in the car but that's OK. 👍🤣
She should br heavily fined or arrested. Pure negligence
It's always a woman 😂
How dumb...
Makes me question the theory of evolution by natural selection
0:49  There you can see the reason, why mankind is damned and got no chance of saving it's existence: Complete and utter ignorance of just EVERYTHING  Just look at her face, she's just screaming "YAY I'M COOL AND SMART AND YAY!" with her expression, just microseconds before getting totally smashed while completely fucking up the event. She's the bloody epitome of human incompetence to exist
This is the perfect edit of this event 👌 saw it live when no one else was lookin 😂
Jail that stupid
Woman ☕
Ofcourse it was a woman.
that lady is a hero
Somebody is still saying I can't take you anywhere !!
Damn, I thought this was more than 2 years ago. Really made my years longer
I hope it broke her arm
Allez opi-omi  skurwysyny! XD
Looks the exact type of person to pull attention seeking BS like this
A race has been destroyed in the goofiest way possible.
Bro it’s always a women causing these situations
Allez Opi Omi! She should have put woman first.
"She will be hunted down for the rest of her life like John Wick in a lame way"  -Jesus/penguinz0
She does not represent the majority of white women!
certificated woman☕ moment
It’s a woman who caused all the pile-up….why am I not surprised about this!?
Like many, I saw this happening live. The insanely stupid behavior still pisses me off.
One of the best things i've ever seen.. Bastards blocking hald the roud deserve some asphalt in the face.
A cardboard sign will not make you crash..🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another white woman out to get mass media attention! 🤣
Haha wankers in lycra
Someone put that spectator in jail for 6 months. :p
A narcissistic women with a sign… shocker.
Definition of stupid
Lol. That's funny People are so F. In. Stupid
This women represents feminists everywhere
staged to get sympathy for the Tour de France,
this is fucking infuriating and so god damn emblematic of the digital age  look someone else is getting attention NOW LOOK AT ME
Worst biker in history!!
It is crazy how much training and suffering these guys go through on a weekly basis to be the godlike elite humans they are.  To then be interfered with like that by such an ignorant IDIOT must be so infuriating, I am amazed that nobody beat the living shit out of the person holding that crappy little cardboard sign.
I would have hurt her. The police would probably had to kill me to stop me.  I am on the spectrum, and that is just how we do.  She is a criminal.  All criminals need to be executed.  There is no more deterrence anymore.  Criminals don't gaf in the least.
LMFAO
This is a tiktoker hanging off a cliff for that perfect pic. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️  Classic selfish 🤳
No fans allowed no write letter pls this
The cyclists should have rung their bells.
I hope this lady comes back every year with her sign. Crashes are the only thing entertaining about this otherwise excruciatingly boring event.
Women.
That lady wasn't even injure, didn't go down.  I pictured her acting like Mr Bean, and looked around nervously and ran away.
Someone take her brain out and give it to someone who will actually use it
What ever happened to her?
Tępa dzida 🤦
Anybody here?
Should be a prison sentence and a full fine for damages ob bicycles and riders, every penny.   Even if it meant debt for life.
I would put her in jail.
Opi and Omi will never forget their loving stupid grandchild.
women.
0:49 : "Allez Opi Omi!" 💥💥💥💀💀💀............ 😦...............😏Awesome!!!
Was her name Karen?
It happened again today and a rider broke his neck. These fans need to be off the track. Wtf
Woman Momment
Didn't know there were so many trash people blaming Tony Martin. It must be that those people feel connected to the stupidity of that person.
Peak of humanity 0:47 😅  What are these spectators thinking....
Omi and Opi are probably ashamed about their degenerated offspring
To be completely fair and honest, its not her fault. We would have made the same mistake as a human. I honestly think its the organization's fault for not putting railings or barracades over that area where people will be.
Lol
~100 cyclists taken out by half of a cardboard sign. I'm not even mad, just impressed.
what did her sign say ? i ha8 Bikes?
Stupid .  She wasn't even a spectator getting in the way with her back to the scene. Just a selfie opportunist
I hope they punished that idiot woman well and made her pay for the damages she caused!
What a surprise... 🤦
I love that you can see her head whiplash. I hope they caught her
Zombono makes better content y'all
A women moment
The lady apparently left france and escaped the charges
Hilarious, should of made a bigger sign!!!
Another worthless woman destroying something good.
That's fucked up as a bicycle
Security presence, barricades/fences, caution tape would have worked. Anywhere with heavy foot traffic, you can bet the level of stupid jumps 200%. Same way drivers become idiots in the rain.
A piece of cardboard can be used as a weapon
It's almost as if you put something in someone's way, they fall.
They should of called the safety car
i'm just surprised the biggest biking event ever doesn't have any sort of security to prevent something like this. You can't tell me they trusted other people to just not fuck it up, especially when it's as easy as being negligent with a piece of cardboard.
Geez... what a nightmare.... the sad part is is that she made an honest mistake I could see a lot of people making, but the repercussions literally dominoed to where so many people are out to get her now. Stuff like this reminds me of how fragile we are.
Wow that dizzy cow of a women just ruined everything.
sadly she was killed in this accident
Any updates??? About the lady's charges?
Maybe it was organised on purpose to break up the competition. Look at the look on her face 2:03
Stupid spectator fucked it
10 000th comment
So dumb
gotta laugh, all their hard work ruined by some idiot
Lol
I have to wash my windscreen every time I overtake cyclists.  Mostly sweaty males in lycra (who will never make it to France) get wet because for some reason one of my squirty things points towards the left .  Oh dear me what a shame never mind.   Just asking - can you put vinegar in your windscreen water?
The men is doing there thing and a woman came along and eff everything  up
All chaos takes is one little push
Why is there so many cyclist so close to each other on this tight road...?!
She should be in jail lol
typical of the french mentalitae , as soon as he causes this 'Accident' , he runs away ! Typical of the Callaboratrice francais , espeially in their last 2500 years  ;D
Emily Davison strikes again.
Not all heroes wear capes
Why do I find this funny?
She le paged the field
The worst part about it is that this lady's intent was to send a message to her ailing grandma who was a Tour de France fan... :(
Hope she got the attention she wanted in court, stupid divvy
She was only fined $1,300 for this. She should have been sued
Ohhhh ...!!!... It was a female fan......color me suprised.
Well... ya know what they always say. Allez Opi Omi!
Beta Cyclist
Female....
Lemmino should make a video on the manhunt
Could have been me at the Milk Ride in Ireland.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsYREFwxYFI
Was this done on purpose
It is not only her fault though, a person who was taking a picture of her across the street picked a wrong background.
This sport is boring anyway, at least for once something noteworthy happened outside of doping scandals.
2021: Just before the bike procession passed, one of the spectators with one foot crossed into the road and abruptly shoved a sign saying 'Cheer up, Grandpa and Grandma (allez opi omi)' towards the broadcast camera.  As a result, Tony Martin, who was running along the edge of the road, hit a sign directly, and about 100 cars crashed and fell in a domino fashion, and some players gave up on the race due to an injury. He was even caught on camera during the match.  The person holding the sign that caused the accident fled the scene, and the tournament is planning to sue this person.  The spectator was eventually arrested in Rendezvous, France, three days after the incident.  The audience is a woman in her thirties of French nationality, she says she did this because she wanted to leave a message of cheering for her grandparents, who are just German, irrespective of the match.  The Tour de France side said that it would not file a lawsuit as the spectators repented and appealed for leniency, but the French prosecutor's office is still in the process of reviewing whether or not to indict.  French prosecutors say that they plan to prosecute regardless of the will of the Tour de France, and that there is a possibility that the players' teams and individual players may file a lawsuit against the spectators.  A fine of 1,200 euros (about 1,600,000 won) was imposed.
I understand this woman was in the way, but why didn’t they have barriers up to prevent people from going into the street?
I hope she gets arrested and france use the guillotina again
Women
That's not a lady, that's a they/them.
People watch too much MoistCr1tikal and take rumors as gospel lol. Why does everyone believe she fled and evaded arrest? She was arrested almost immediately and only faced a fine under $2,000. I believe it was $1,600 (or 15k euro) to be exact and up to a year in prison—and that was all IF the injured rider pressed charges.   She will 100% not serve the year in prison.  At most she has to pay a small fine.  It wasn't a huge deal and there was NEVER some kind of, "international manhunt" 😂
I hope she got the Nobel prize.
🤣🤣🤣
And, are your grandparents proud?
Well looks like we cant have shit in France either.
A boring sport without a shred of honour, followed by joyless apologists, just got more interesting.
Really irresponsible from the cyclist that ruined her sign
Did they catch her?
0:49 okay pause and see how long u can take it..
What stupid people do for a couple of hours of fame. The media has killed this F planet.
Amazing how she pulled off the same exact thing she did at the Suez Canal.
I don't get why people have to joke about this,  it's not funny.. and that bystander,  probably for the sake of taking a greedy all about me selfie, what's wrong with people, no consideration for others' safety
At least two guys installing glass didn't walk across the road
what a legend hahaha
bet she wouldnt do the same at a nascar race
I prefer Group B rally car crashing the spectator than this.
If you want to know she got arrested and paid 1,300 fine
Nobody has the answer about what happened to the person who hit the racer ?
She has to be the most ignorant female alive. She belongs in jail.
IM LAUGHING SOOOOOO HARD!!!! THAT DUDE WAS FAVORED TO WIN!!! HE DID EVEN BETTER AFTER THE CRASH. HE STAGED THE CRASH!!! TAKE A CLOSE LOOK. HE BARELY TOUCHED THE SIGN!!!!
Hey, look. Another Karen.
1 BOT 2 HAM 3 MSC 4 MAZ 5 SAI 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
"Fan"
who will win? about 50 tough cyclers vs 1 attention seeking lady holding a cardboard sign
All for a picture
women😐
Get used to much more of this. The idiots are winning.
One word... woman.
Flobikes? More like floorbikes
Sign says "Go gramma-granpa!"
kinda of a wonder nothing worse has happened. she only got fined like 2k usd for this. they bet on this in america lol couldnt someone just pretend to fall in road or act stupid and walk out as peloton rolls up lol
That lady is lucky she didn't get her bones caved in by a bunch of angry cyclists. That would have been a reasonable response.
those bikes need to be equipped with those custom bike horns that those aggressive bikers use in NYC
You can try and blame it on the spectator, but dude on the bike OBVIOUSLY doesn't know how to ride a bike. No, the spectator shouldn't have been right there, but its not difficult to stay on a bike when you bump into something. Children do it every freaking day.  lmfao
Imagine all bikes are broken and she has to pay for repairs i can imagine this is in the near millions these are all carbon bikes
Hahahahahaha….
Women in their 50ies should never be allowed to leave home unless it's needed to buy food at the grocery or have their sewing machine fixed.
Don't get the excitement of this sport but to each their own
People will do anything to get on live TV, apparently.
wow, when the announcer said “the fan wasn’t supposed to be there”   that’s not how it works, those man are in control of the machines and responsible for not hitting anything.....that’s how it’s been since the invention of machines, it ridiculous to change the blame now
Well, go home and get your affairs in order, folks. Sauron just took Minas Tirith.
When it comes to animated cartoons, the fights between Peter Griffin and the Big Chicken are hands down, the absolute funniest thing I ever seen. It just kills me. Seth MacFarlane should make an episode about a mammoth bicycle race crash, involving Peter riding drunk and naked.
The French and their bicycles make me giggle. I like the Isle of Man motorcycle races better. But that's just my 2 pence.
lmao her grandma and grandpa will disown her XD
Is that a women?...oh yeah it is
Dislike
-She's just perfect for being a supervisor at my job.
French prosecutors had asked for a 4 month suspended sentence but I guess the judge thought that was too harsh because all she got was a €1,200 fine plus a symbolic €1 paid to the French Cycling Federation. I hope she's still liable for civil damages because €1,200 probably wouldn't cover the repairs for even one of those bikes. And Marc Soler broke both his arms in the crash.
Crazy person
Her opi omi would be so proud
All she got is a 1200€ fine
มนุษย์ป้าเอาตัวลงไปในถนนพร้อมกับชูป้ายข้อความ "สู้ๆ คุณปู่ คุณย่า" ที่เขียนเป็นภาษาเยอรมัน จนทำให้ โทนี มาร์ติน นักปั่นชาวเยอรมันที่ขับมาถึงจุดนั้นพอดีพุ่งชนตัวเธอเต็มๆ และกลายเป็นการชนต่อๆ กันแบบโดมิโน บรรดานักปั่นที่ขับตามกันมาเกิดอุบัติเหตุไม่ต่ำกว่า 50 ราย หลายคนต้องถอนตัวออกจากการแข่งขัน รวมถึง มาร์ก โซเลร์ นักปั่นชาวสเปนซึ่งได้รับบาดเจ็บแขนหักทั้ง 2 ข้าง นับเป็นหนึ่งในเหตุการณ์จักรยานชนครั้งเลวร้ายที่สุดของ ตูร์ เดอ ฟรองซ์
Go to 0:46 for best angle
A €1200 fine isn’t justice. Should have been way more.
so funny, did she really genuinely think this wouldn't happe
She just did her favorite thing, leave her alone.
Lol, possibly the worst thing you can possibly do to the most entitled sportsmen on this planet 😂
Cycling has to be the most boring "sport" (next after golf) to watch. Wasn't this exciting? I mean, something happened at least 🤷 😅
1200 fine to this genius.
We've all done things as stupid as that, stop being so judgmental.
Huge tour de France crash, it must be a sign.
She have a financiële damage 1200 euro. She said i'm sick of the media attention. I thinking she want attention and she get attention.
I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough - mr peterman
She got 1200 euro fine for doing this.
What's her name.  What's her address.  What's her phone number 🤔 that's what I want to know
Well they might have lost two WW´s, but they certainly won this one! 🙂
Today she is sentenced to pay €1200. A bargain 😀
Lets hope she never attends any rally. Its almost hilarious how shocked her expression is, like it never ocurred to her that she might get hit by a cyclist ...
The things women do to get attention...
Just like Steve Bartman of Chicago Cubs fame.
Is she crying playing victim until now?
I’m not even from there or a fan but this lady pisses me off
Its always the women.
Lol forgive the poor woman she can't help it if she's not bright
Hi. This is yours truly. I'll make sure she doesn't end up here when she bites the dust. I've already phones lucifer and he says that he'll have someone on standby so she can be brought under immediately after she dies. Chhers
Was the spectator OK 🙄 This is what happens when you tailgate the person in front 🤣
i like how they literally run over his head with their bikes
Couldn’t they go around her ?
It sounds like guy talking (presenter) more seriously took that someone broke the rules for not looking at the group of cyclists vs. being a moron waving a sign reading “granddad and grandma”
If I’m the camera man I’ll zoom in to that stupid fan on the side of the road
This shits hilarious
She must be PUNISHED...
I love the way she's just slowly walking back and disappear after this incident
Maybe there's someone on twitter will defend her and make topic about it lol
That sign could be sold on eBay.
Lol
Dear Nerd-lady, crashing some bicycles isn't that hard to do.  Try this at a Nascar race, that will impress your grandparents!
Of course she runs away
Oops
She should be charged with attempted murder cause that fist cyclist who fell could have been killed under that much crowd.
She is probably complaining why the cyclists not avoiding her signage,  and thinking,” aren’t they stupid to crash into me?”
All people who have taken a selfie are partially guilty for this woman's behavior.
She or he looks like a dimwit too
this and the Canary Islands crash. A pattern is forming...smh
I hate cyclists, especially these guys, like HORSES exist already and are so much better, i would acctually watch street horse racing
The face that crashed a thousand bikes, Karen of Troy.
She is one reason why the condom was invented.
I know it's harsh to charge criminally in a way but I'd have settled for the front 3-5 riders she took down taking her into a room and beating her for a minute. That would do it, fucking moron. It was 100% her fault.
If they were all spaced out there wouldn't have been the domino effect causing pandemonium.
Makes cycling mildly entertaining at least
This  congested race shouldn't be happening. Authorities should have barricaded the spectators. So many people are injured.
shes in prison now lol
i hope she was jailed
Why no one told her ass to get out of the way
I can tell she’s definitely getting shamed on after this.
The woman was spinner around, clearly more than just a cardboard hit. Body to body and/or bike hit.
still funny
this is call real terrorist is
Haha
I really wish someone can, or I wish I can invent a full suit bike gear that involves airbags used for sports like this.   I recently crashed on the road with my bike and my injures still hurt badly.
A piece of cardboard held at the very end wiped this man off his bike.  Not caught in the wheels or pedals.  Hits him approximate mid chest and knocks him off.  What a weak, weak man.. lol
funniest shit that's ever happened
What the sign say?
its funny how easily he fell
good work
and the girl passed the jail punishment
0:54 - I love how the bike of the 2nd biker glitches in the matrix.  It shows how stiff their bikes are, this is incredible!
"Did I do that?" Urkel
That lady is stupid or what?? 🙄
Serves her right if she will get both punishment, a big fine and jailtime.
May her head be used as a finish sign for the future Daytona 500 rally race .
Came back here after seeing the latest news today; the woman who caused the crash will spend 4 months in jail for this. Nice. I hope Tony Martin and all the bikers who were affected are okay tho. I was so worried that the biker behind him would ride straight across his neck 😣😣
He’ll be really pissed that he too the bell off his new bike when he bought it from Halfords
Trust a stupid lady to cause the biggest crash in Tour de France history, just couldn't make it up. Why are these idiots allowed on the road ? put a barrier up.
She was planning on doing the same thing at the formula 1 this week! Unfortunately for us she’s at court 🤦🏼
She's a secret agent planted by that blue Jersey team
This makes me happy in a way, now I know my country doesn't hold a monopoly on stupid people.
I counted that have 22 survive.
Dafuq is a "peloton"?
Where is the close-up photo of her face? Priceless. Absolutely genius. She should get the consolation prize in Darwin Awards.
Ok back to the start guys
You guys already know people love crashes so finally they saw it and they got happy about it
Who watching in 2025? Leave a like
People are really stupid this days
Sort of thing you'd love to see when in your car
I mean she is really stupid, but wtf is the biker doing? I mean you see her and you don't even yell or anything before the collision?
All's well that ends well.  Just another woman doing her part to smash the patriarchy (I did not see any women on those bikes).  haha
Next time put people behind a line, since people are idiots they have to be fenced out.
she is now facing 1 Year in prison and a minimum 15K fine
What did the sign say?
I don´t think she gave television watchers the right impression with her sign ; )
A better crash than in a nascar race 👌🏼
I didn't see her run away until it was possible that one of the people there was screaming at her like, "run girl run! they will kill your ass!", and she ran in fear...😗 just my imagination...😗
Poor poor poor safety precaution. Such a narrow lane and there is no safety barrier in place. Not everyone will be thinking right. There could be a child dashing out crossing, or a cyclist losing control and crashing into fans. I don't usually watch such events but is this normal? I hope this incident serves as a lesson for future organizer to improve the safety for both athletes and fans.   I feel bad for these athletes and some may suffer injuries that end their career. :'( some may have planned this to be their last chance to compete and it ended in such a preventable disaster. this is very sad.   I also feel bad for this lady. What she did was wrong, but it was clear that she did not intend to harm anyone. It was a bad mistake, but not malicious. She will feel terrible for a very very long time.
..i feel so sad..months of training, of sacrifice months, gone...
bodonye hor  tine tu molek katok je
i hate how theres fuck all footage showing it
the word 'stupid' was invented for her.
She’ll cry in court, say she was sorry and walk away.  If she was male he would be in gaol already.
She disappeared after that crash she nowhere to found 😫😫😫
I think she earned her spot in the Karen hall of infamy
hahaha i hate bikers
They tryna sue her. Lol well maybe tell people to stand ten feet back.
https://youtube.com/c/AhmadNaeemKhan
Sure, she was dumb. However, the organiser should know better. I mean, what do you expect when you don't have any proper barrier protecting the drivers from dumb fans. Even without any dumb fan, you can have huge crashes with more than 100 bikes on the road that aren't made for stability but for speed.
Not coming to my garden party that skunk
Wot a garden party skunkasorus lad
You can just imagine what the people around her said and thought 😂 I bet she got some right stick for that STUPID act!
"Imagine spending your entire life to compete in Tour de France and then having some nitwit dressing as Paddington Bear erased everything you ever worked for all because she needed to be seen" - Joey B Toonz
Now she's famous after all
Kinda annoying that absolutely nothing happened to that lady. She didn't get banned, arrested or charged.
How did none of the cyclists attack her out of anger? I know I would’ve
muié é foda
was she caught by the police?
Retard.
dumbest sport ever
And I was worried about my silly mistakes
The enthusiastic fan should do the same on the track of TT Isle Of Man.. 😅
Damn it Karen you ruined everything!
_A single little fire can burn everything down._   *I think I know what did it mean...*
All charges are pulled from her. This is not justice, also because she described as "fragile" Court take pity on her what a shame. At least what they must do is to reveal her identity so other fans take example from her and never do idiotic things anymore. I'm angry that sometimes identity of perpetrator not revealed.
Women... I am right?
She made a mistake but the fact that there is a manhunt shows a very horrible side of humanity. It's a fcking sporting event
This honest to God reminds me up something out of a cartoon where are the characters of crash and bang into each other!😂🤣  But then I remember how painful it must’ve been for everybody falling off their bike injuring themselves😬🤕
Hahaha flimsy cardboard took out a grown ass man 😂😂😅😂
Think she styed until the end? Lmao
WHAT AN IDIOT SPECTATOR
I'm not mad at this woman's stupidity I'm impressed how she manage to destroy an entire event with one whack
If I was her I wouldnt blame anyone who calls me a bitch
I never understood why when these things happen the cyclist when they got back up they beat the cr@p out of these idiots
Paperboy
i mean, if it's such a big deal, why not have better security? Or pause the race if something like this happens? Instead, everyone is like "HOW COULD SHE HAVE MANAGED THIS FEAT OF EVIL?!?! OFF WITH HER HEAD!!!!"
Spectators should be kept a meter back from the side of the road.
Quella deficiente col cartello !
Can someone explain how the majority of spectators get there? This looks like the countryside, not the middle of town. Do they drive up on side roads, park, walk to the course & wait?
Too funny!
Quelle connerie cette femme!😕😩🤦
Can someone explain rules what happen after situation like this?
This could have been avoided, if only they paid heed to the signs...
I never thought I'd see someone so stupid. I'm dying of laughter.
Pobrecitos😓 Quien fue el invecil q hiso eso😡😡
Ban her from any competitions in 2024 Paris Olympics
The smile shes making while holding the sign, man he should have just ran into her properly
Well. She got the attention she craved.
What did the sign say? Hopefully something really stupid.
Its the sign for me.   🤣
Anti-abortionists should watch this video and do some serious soul searching.
Typical men though... they never see the signs women show them...
watch the courts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzZ4HmvbT0A Mad orange
She needed to be fined!!!!
Lol she fled the country
A legend once said, "Cycling track and family park should not be built on the same location"
Maybe she was hired either by betting mafia or rival team, things people do for money.
Gotta feel bad for the guy that immediately ate shit
typical woman
THE YAKUZA GOT HER !!!!
I feel like, what’d they expect. Theyre following each other so closely
Looks like she has an art major to me.. lol
She got caught yet?
It's exactly 1 month after this disastrous crash had occured. Its unbelievable and unfortunate at the same time.
She definitely has she/her on her Twitter bio.
Now I have to go and watch the Russian riot police kick women in the stomach for therapy.
Banter
Human domino
Her grandma watching the whole thing happen on tv: 😦
What did the sign say, you should go mountain biking like proper bikers? 🤣
This is what will happen if you prioritize narcissism over the safety of yourself and others
Did this crazy person get jailed?
The rage in my head
This is why you should always run against traffic. I stopped correcting people because you know natural selection should just run its course. It’s an absolute pity that the race had to stop for this ass hat. What’s even worse is that equipment was damaged and people were hurt.
She is a gay spectator that dressed like a boy. This is why gae society started hated, they are too narcissistic sometimes.
Another case of woman's desperate need for attention causing problems
He could have looked more than 3 feet in front of him and she could have taken a few steps back. They are both at fault 🤦🏼🤷🏼‍♂️
She's the reason shampoo has instructions on the back
"Don't trust women who have Onlyfans accounts" - Winston Churchill
The lady is stupid and has no evil intentions, no question, but she is not the only one guilty here, the organizers should have considered such a scene beforehand and intervened. Too bad, all the years of hard work for these cyclists at a great organization have been for nothing. In the end, from my point of view, the only positive aspect of this accident, even if it was in a bad way, this lady brought my attention to this sport, I was never interested in these bike races before, and after a little research now I have become a fan of it.
i’m not saying she isn’t at fault here but like why isn’t there a railing separating the sprectators and bikers..!😑
Kesel
Years of hardwork turned into dust because of a dumb fan. Great job!
Pat, I’ll take  “Morons” for 1,000 please
I swear, the worst thing is her fucking pose with her chin in the air. Ridiculous in the first place. I'm sure she was thinking GUFUFU EVERYONE WILL SEE ME ON TV SAYING HI TO PAPI AND MAMI I'M SO BRILLIANT  I'm all for forgiving instantaneous stupidity but this was planned and rehearsed, and at no point did she think that it's not something any sane person would do. So she should be fully on board with the consequences.
Did they catch this moron?
Looked like he was almost able to just ride through it like a team going through the giant sign out of the locker room
What a disgrace
Really foolish. She should be fined.
This is too fucking funny.  Lmao
That woman should be fined.
Minus the stupidity, that fan is me accidentally creating havoc everywhere I go lmao
woman moment
lycra wearing cyclists are usually the first to sling insults at people so this is kind of kino to watch
Most excitement I've seen in This event in 35yrs!
This is so unfair.  That poor lady made her sign with love and they broke it , what a shame.
She won a trophy of forever being hated by cyclists. At least she got what she wanted, being on camera and showing her sign to everyone even the cyclists who crash into it. lol
I’m just hoping she now does this at a WRC rally......
🤦‍♂️
Ptdrr
She looks like a typical Karen, and acted like one 😂😂 I feel bad for the riders tho
From what a friend told me that she has a   Received a lifetime ban for causing that
TOUR DE ITALY (💖) 100 vs TOUR DE FRANCE (🤑)  01
Now she’ll be living in cardboard
Imagine the death threats she got for this stupidity
Worlds smartest fan.
Maybe it's time to have fences along the track, to try and stop bitches from infringing on the track.
I think she did it on purpose
I don’t understand why they didn’t lower their shoulders and knock the spectator down.
She’s now being sued
I miss the rage I miss the rageI miss the rage I miss the rage I miss the rage I miss the rage i miss the rage I miss the rage I miss the rage I miss the rage miss the rage I miss the rage I miss the rage I miss the rage i miss the rage I miss the rage

"Idiots will take over the world, not by capacity, but by quantity; they're just too many". Nelson Rodrigues, Brazilian writer.
Did they find waldo yet?
The old Jeff Foxworthy, "Here's your Sign" technique. Touche
People that causes this kind of fall should be arrested...
Si se observa bien parece intensional ya q esta consciente de la magnitud del evento, su cercania, su posicion en espacio y tiempo.  Hace cara de pendeja como viendo un pajarito que pasó en el cielo
geweldig dit. die toeschouwer zou hier betaald voor moeten worden. en bij elke keer dat die gene het doet zou die een bonus moeten krijgen per wielrenner die op zijn muil gaat. i love it.
These people have committed their lives to being able to compete in this event...many people have invested in supporting them also. This bystander felt their interests superceded all of this. Injury, disappointment etc. No one invests in consequential thinking anymore.
Go to :48.  Start screen- shots.  The perpetrator actually stepped On to road, IN the obvious pathway!?  It was clearly a Deliberate Act ... with NO Natural Reflex or attempt to move cardboard away, once it was impacted by the first biker.  SEE the same Duping Delight smile on the yellow-jacketed chaos-causer, before, during & after the cardboard sign got hit.  PLAIN TO SEE. Deliberate chaos is the new norm, evidently.  Not "accidents".
goddam
No one is asking the important questions - like, what did her sign say???
DUDE! That's Waldo!
I'm glad she got her attention
When you take your wife to the  tour de france for the first time and she says. "let me pop over the road for a picture with the sign i made" !!!!!!
Did they arrest this woman? She is a liberal, generation Z who voted for Obama, Biden 3 times and loves transgender sports. She needs to be in PRISON for assault and TIRE battery.
HUGE CRASH YOU KNOW
Hello, people from 2031 getting this video recommended to you for the first time! Yes, this moment really IS the single most 2021 moment that could ever happen. Thank you for reading my comment!
Joeybtoonz brought me here.
it was obvious something like this was going to happen, the signs where all there.
"Riders"? To ride on something implies not using one's own force. You can ride a motorcycle, a horse, a bull, a rollercoaster, a hookr, but not a bicycle.  Theyll do anything to make bicycling sound cool...
I'm pretty sure she is a liberal lesbian
I really feel sorry for her... Imagine careening that your hole life. We are man! We fall and we stand up!
Lol, Tony Martin couldn't see the flimsy cardboard sign straight ahead of him, so he flinches like a thirteen year old girl and wipes out nearly the entire field 👏😆. He plowed through the sign THEN did a LeBron flop. 😆😆😆😆😆👌🏼
0:49 the woman wears a yellow jacket and blue jeans hold the big sign cause the catastrophe accident....so sad.
LOOOOOOOOL
If Mr. Bean had a sister
gave new meaning to picture fail
0:30 yellow git holding out far asking to smack one and it did and caused the domino effect and as i a active lover and biker it pisses me off
What is written on the board. Plz translate!
"The woman, who has not been named, was arrested and questioned over the crash caused by her large cardboard sign during the first stage of the race in northwestern Brittany.  A statement from the prosecutor's office in the town of Brest said she had been ordered to appear in court on October 14 where she could face charges of negligence and causing unintentional bodily harm.  Jasha Sütterlin (Team DSM) was taken to hospital with an injured hand, while Marc Soler (Movistar) finished the stage but abandoned the next morning after fractures in both arms were revealed. Eight other riders were seen by the race doctor and numerous more suffered minor injuries."  Following the incident, Tour de France Deputy Director Pierre-Yves Thouault said the tour would take legal action against the woman: "We are suing this woman who behaved so badly. We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this do not spoil the show for everyone," he told AFP news agency."
Broo elle abuse 😂
00:15 Ok... his brain has leave him by another bycicle..  😅. 😪😪
Knob
That was a really stiff sign-can’t tell if body contact was made-I wondered when this would happen in my lifetime.
Le cyclisme  devient comme le football francais ils arretent pas de tomber 😂😂
This lady is worse than a shark at a surf competition lol.
When people do dumb sh#@t like this they should be publicly shamed and ridiculed.
To those who says that it was just cardboard, it isn't just cardboard but also an arm, look at the video carefully
That person could well be a Karen before Karens.
They've been saying for years now that they have been thinking of barring off the spectators with a fence or something so they can't run out on the road.Maybe this is what will actually make them bring it into effect,
What did her sign say??? Did it say Trump Won?? 😂
Wouldn't be to Tour de France without Di&*heads like that. Doesn't surprise me at all.
It was a cardboard sign......wtf.
Had no idea about this until i saw a meme 😂
Payback for riding 4 wide on the street and not yielding for cars. Bless this woman
why women are like this
Boring asf
Narcissistic generation...look at me, look at me, look at me!
Nothing screams dickhead louder than causing a massive crash through pure stupidity and selfishness then leaving the scene of the crime before any questions can be asked
Funny as hell
She's not even a fan she's just there for likes and attention
ALLEZ OPI-OMI! (Now who will pay money for this one?)
I bet she's completely satisfied with herself and has absolutely no thought of remorse. 😐
They got her. 😂😂😂
Yeah the woman is at fault, but the organization is the bigger fault. The roadway should be clear at least 15 feet back. European countries all do that spectator crap where people stand on a country road, as race cars are zipping past, running off curvy dirt roads, down embankments, its nuts.
They shouldn’t be this close to begin with. Unintentional stupidity, that is all. Shit happens.
😂😂😂
she need to be arrested
PRIZE MONEY FOR THIS SPORT IS TOO LOW AS COMPARED TO OTHER SPORTS.
Not only did she do something shitty in an attempt to get attention she took no accountability. Broad runs off. Waiting for her to be named like most criminals
Lmao this is hilarious. She shouldn’t of been holding her dumb sign in the way but dude couldnt have moved ? Lmao
Wonderful, get that Man a beer, hilarious waste of fkn money.
I don't get it, you take a day out to watch the tour, probably involves some travel and planning, few hours of waiting and then when the tour is about to pass by you turn your back.
This is payback for every slow cyclist on the road. Good on her!!
“I don’t know what happened!”  Instructions to commentator: 1. Watch race 2. Talk about it  Fail on 1!
Shaved legs all scraped up. I wonder if any spandexes got ripped. Tragic.
They should ban banners
Should get jail time for that shit
This kinda reminds me of the Chicago Cubs "Bartman incident" where a young man unintentionally interferes in the game with devastating results for everyone (including himself.). In the end the lady is guilty of nothing but plain stupidity and bad luck.
this video taught me what "peloton" means hahaha
You really can’t teach common sense..
Have charges been brought against her?
Why is this on my feed? I fucking hate sports! I couldn't give a flying fuck.
I'm glad they arrested her and she's getting sued by the tour DE France...She is an idiot!!
0.49 what does the sign say .... lmao look at the smile on her face
SMH 🤦‍♀️ I feel like we need to give some people a whooping
Best thing I have ever seen
If the riders choose to press charges it’s 18 k per rider sonyeah
How can you crash by hitting a lightweight cardboard sign? Had he just ridden through the sign nothing would have happened. Completely ridiculous !
How have they not identified this woman yet?
her 15 minutes is going to cost her a lifetime of income.
Idiot
More bothered about been on TV!
Since they're never gonna catch her, I pray that her arm was broken from getting hit. 🙏
That woman needs locking up
He should be ashamed of himself getting taken out by a bit of cardboard like that
Wonder if she will have to spend the rest of her life in hiding, maybe drastic plastic surgery, all the teams involved would like them to bring back the Gileteen
Hilarious how a grown man gets owned off his bike by a flimsy sign and her arm.That sign just dropped that pansy so hard hahahahaha
Is this woman some sort of racist? 😭🤣
Damage done. Was the race restarted instead?
Typical inconsiderate cyclists, think they own the road.  If they hadn't have been riding 10 abreast, she would've had plenty of room to safely hold her sign up.
Hero
Did you see what those privileged white males did to that poor woman’s sign? Another act of violence against women! The Tour de France is obviously misogynistic! Disgusting!
Mwajajajajajaja, yes. I love this! Perfect! Absolutely perfect.!!!!!!
Woman...what do u expect
Word on the circuit is she’s in hiding with the CUBS fan.
This wasn't intentional. If you can't cycle past a piece of flimsy cardboard without falling off then you shouldn't be on the Tour.
Ok but seriously, they should have the area guarded with side rails on both sides because stupid people still exist, and she acts shocked when she got hit by a bike, as if it was the bikers fault, when really it was really her fault.
The sign wasn't even good enough to take a picture of. Looks like it was haphazardly glued together on the way there 😂!
Looks like something from a family guy skit
You dont realise it but she did great event to the biggest fraud sport in history
how you gonna take all those steroids and let a cardboard sign take you out?
They put up railing’s at parades and concerts, why wouldn’t they put them up here? I don’t think they should blame this woman, she’s probably traumatized by what happed.
Attention seeking syco-fan-t,  posing for cameras. Hopefully she''ll get  her craved- for few minutes of fame when found, in the form of    public humiliation  and at least  a fine for interference and massive damage. Absolute stupidity.
Thank God the sign didn't get hurt
SHOCKING!!! HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN!!
ALEZOPI-OMI ! theres a start to the investigation. Translated means: Now you see me now you dont!
Someone could of been really hurt what a fool that woman is
It’s like the end of Caddy shack when Carl the grounds keeper blows up all the gophers and greens and walks cowardly away! 🎱👀🎱
I'm more worried about why the dude is such a pussy he couldn't make it through the cardboard
I hope the board is ok
Seriously they should start handing out fines for fans that do stupid things like this. Also they should control what fans write on the roads,,,,,,, no need for offensive language.
what did the sign say?
Opi omi that was a bad crash !
0:06 he called it
Omi & opi must be proud of her
What an idiot. Classic.
How rude of that rider to hit that sign !
SOIDS! THE! QUESTION! IS! WHAT? DOES! MICHAEL!!! INDURAN!!! THE! SPANIARD! THE! TOUR! DE! FRANCE! (G,O,A,T)!!! THINK! OF! THIS! DISASTER! SOIDS! FOR! THE! RECORD! THIS! IS! CRUCIALLY!!! (IMPORTANT)!!! PELE!!! IS! THE! FOOTBALL!!! (G,O,A,T)!!!
Women moment
So when a huge crash like this happens, do they temporarily pause the race? What’s the procedure here? I heard some people got really hurt.
Biatch screwing up others...
Allez Omi u Opi 😂😂😂😂
John Wick: Cyclist Edition
It's impressive that no matter the country, the level of civilization or whatever, there will always have someone that thinks is special enough so that the rules don't apply to them. Will learn its place the hard way.
Un tik toker ,
Life in Prison.
What's really incredible is that no one saw any sign this was going to happen! Hope getting clocked at 30+ mph and ruining the Tour de France for being an idiot gives her nightmares and cold sweats for a while.
I NEED to know she got arrested and will BE SUED BIG TIME 🤬
shoulda put his hand out and deflected the CARBOARD. and not acted like a footballer drama queen.  sign shouldnt have been there but the rider saw that coming a mile off.  im blaming the rider on this one.
I'm usually against any type of hatred but oh does this make my blood boil... the level of STUPIDITY
Thank you lady, you helped Tadej Pogačar to win this years Tour by killing off his main rivals.
The meaning of my name is watchful and alert
This is why they make ringing bells to put on your bicycle handlebars.
🇸🇮👍👏
Completely lost interest in tdf after all doping scandals
Pete & Sebastian brought me here.. it’s cardboard guy cmon
No one cares about bicycle riding
Clearly that was an accident I heard that person is on the Run what could they charged her with
people should be at least 15-20 feet away from these pros it's insane how the promoters dont see this stupidity.She was PAID to do this I bet a million buks.
The b was taking pictures for social media. Pity they retrieved charges against her. They should have sentenced her at least to a fine and communal services. Shame on her stupid b
プラカードどこにむけてるの
Load of MAMILs hit the deck ! No double-six required. Good start.
Someone needs to give this F1 commentary, of something like Spa '98, Nurburgring '07, Spa '12 or Mugello '20.
arrest that moron lady
omg it's my neighbour Iwana Nokemova
Ai Pelle Peloton vai ehehehehe
Marketing Tip for Tour de France: they should have fun obstacles like those for cyclists, it would make things even more interesting ! And lots of love to all purists who are gonna hate this in comments 😘
Allez Opi Omi !
😂😂😂😂😂😂
mira el terrible accidente que es provocado por un estúpido ..que quiere ser  fotografiado o visto en cámaras..😡🤬
Headline: Tour De Lite Group B.  The powerful 2hp push bike hits an over joyed fan too distracted with a sign, who is way over the line.  _06/07/2021 5:27pm_
Lol.
cyclist in front: "I owe you one lady"
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH look at them fall
Did she get the picture tho?
Idiat 👁👁
The Bastille is to good for her. This calls for the guillotine. Just kidding. Wonder what the total cost of damages was. Bent frames and wheels not to mention shattered dreams. Hopefully nobody got retired.  I'm sure sure some riders were sore.
This is fucking hilarious. There’s outrage over this?  People are dying and losing their businesses and people are worried over some bikes crashing in some stupid bike race lmaooo
The worst thing is that the cyclists were probably training for years and some serious injuries could of happened there.
Allez Opi.Omii?
Hayyy Dios mio pobres muchachos
that fan needs to be tar & feathered in front of city hall . . .
They will probably sue her. Her bank account will be emptied pretty soon.
Bauhahahahahahs
Welp she's gonna be added to the compilations for many years to come.
If you ride that close what do you expect. Twats
2020. Men are entering women's sports and ruining them. This lady:
Should have sued her to set a precedence. Stupidity doesn't learn without punishment.
Eso lo hizo con intención. 😒
She really ended up being famous like she wanted too 😂😂😂
Did that one holding the sign has a damaged brain? People nowadays are not thinking straight lol
The history loves that motive: so many lads fall for one lass.
Brilliant 😂😂
Poor lady with the sign.
Why does she have a find Waldo outfit on, but no one has found her yet?
The headline should be: "Pro cyclists are too stupid to divert 50cm to the side" Of course she shouldn't have been there in the first place, but look from how far away the cyclists have seen her. Still just riding straight through. No merci for all of'em. All acted as stupid as somehow possible. And that's called pro cyclists, my ass.
When Millennials attack!  So selfish and dumb
Good metaphor for how our society is collapsing.
100% meme, 0% brain
“This is a terrible way to start Tour de France “ yeah you don’t say 😂
Build up
Fun fact: this women fled the country immediately and is being tracked down so she can be sued
Well, PREPARE THE MANHUNT
All that because she wanted a picture.
The cyclist should have buckled up and ran through the sign with his helmet. He crashed because his got tangled with her.
The Simpsons must have guessed 😁
I'm surprised they don't call the group platoon
Every time I see this I think of that meme “only white people would think bike riding is a sport, I know a crackhead that would dust the entire Tour de France on a Barbie bike”
Stupidity at its best
onnanohitozeetaia...teekanjidaatarouna
The accident looked like something straight out of a BeamNG Drive pileup
Guns don’t kill people....Karens kill people.
If you ever do something stupid watch this video to feel better about yourself
This is one of those moments where i felt, Thanos should come into existence and shred such type of people to the last atom 😅 or else someone wield gauntlet, I'll do it by myself 😂
USA mainstream headlines: sexist trolls attacking women for ruining tour de France
I laughed when I saw the replays lol she was so happy.
The title of this video -- like the entire reporting of this incident -- is wrong. One could just as well argue that the cyclists were as much to blame for the accident as the hapless fan was, since a cyclist riding on the edge of the road knows ahead of time that a fan might obstruct their right of way.  See: https://priorprobability.com/2021/07/05/ronald-coase-and-the-tour-de-france/
I hope she’s charged 🤬
Main lesson: *Just stand back and watch not to seek attention on the camera*
Her grandparents later announced they have decided to disown her
She wanted to become famous on social media. Now she got famous in jail
Why didnt he move? is he blind?
I hope she's not the reason why Titanic sink.
You wait literally hours for them to arrive, and then chose not to watch. Same as people missing goals at the euros because they are trying to film them on their phones. Live in the moment!!
That person should pay for everyone's injuries! FOR BEING STUPID!!!
THIS is why the Franks started speaking a Roman language and we're still speaking our Germanic one. 🤣
Well, at least the other fans beat the crap out of them... Right? No? Why not?
I feel bad for them 😞
Looks set up by the blue team
Hope the grand parents are proud.
The worlds stupidest sport is brought down by the worlds stupidest fan. Seems fitting.
Ultimate woman moment
"Stupidity of a fan..." Very well said.
Don't need an excuse to make these people more agro.
Tour De fucked 🤣
Ridiculous. Spectators should not be allowed on the kerb only embankments
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH
Great for the tour de france. Bet the directors are celebrating off camera (increasing ratings?).
If you´re having a shitty day i remind you that the dude who hit her arm just got rolled over by 80+ other dudes with bikes
She made history there
Why what happened some1 die？ anyone dead? So dangerous ho no！！🤦🏻‍♂️
I lost interest in Tour de France because of unruly fans. It's happening year after year and organizers are sleeping on it... the tour fails miserably in protecting their riders.
Como carajos te caes con un cartón
This is hilarious
What an idiot, I hope she will pay her price !
hilarious 😂
Lesbians 🙄
Well she got the attention of the police for sure. Good thing she got arrested.
In other news, Naked Gun 44.4 has competed casting for Frank Drebins daughter.
Stupidity at its finest!
You can imagine how she is driving a car on public roads !
*he didn't hit the cardboard. He hit her whole arm. lol*
Une compétition mal organisée
I think she is going to be named the sign lady and made memes on for this decade
She’s currently getting charged in court. Nice
She should go to jail for that.
Consider this as a "crime" of yellow jacket spectator..she will regrets on her whole life watching this video 🙄
Less face it until the lady in the yellow jacket stirred things up it was a boring race to look at anyway 😂🇬🇧
Cupid stunt.
What a dick.he wasn't even looking at the riders.total knob
Love watching cyclists fall over 🤣
He didn’t hit the sign, but her arm. That’s worse. The sign would’ve collapsed.
Stupid woman. I hope she get Sued for everything she owns!
The stupidity is that the people are allowed so close in the first place! An accident waiting to happen....which has
Best bit of cycling I have ever seen.
15 minutes of fame? Could be 15 years for the crime...how stupid can one individual be?
Elle a décidé qu il n y aura pas de course 🤣 alors s est fait 😅
Hahaha
Who’s cares!!!! this sort of things been happening for years and nothings been done about it,all I can say to the organisers is “put up or shut up”.
How fricking stupid can someone be!!??
Let the memes begin...
Shes just on a killstreak
it might have been avoided. The Tour has been plagued by stupid spectators for decades.
Karen couldn't get her point across. So she made a sign.
hpw tf does a piece of cardboard make your fall over? BETA MALE!
It's amazing the other fans didn't yell or yeet this person out of the way, they were looking at the cyclists coming up from behind.  It's not their job and this was totally on the recklessness of the fan, but I'm just wondering how this could've happened.  If the fan was too fast, then the fan knew the riders were right there.  Perhaps this was intentional....?     Anything's possible when money's on the line!  $$$
If a small cardboard sign takes out the entire race, maybe she's not the only issue here.
she's a stupid, but the organizers shouldn't allow the audience to get too close to the racers, it's not entirely her fault.  oh god.. She needs coffee ☕
Why are spectators allowed so close to the riders? Looks like accidents waiting to happen throughout entire race. We all know there are hundreds of stupid people attending any sport and this lady just timed her stupidity   at the wrong time. If that makes sense. There's always an idiot and there should be punishments put in place for any spectator that affects the outcome of any sport.
can you say publicity stunt. PELETON
I don't care for cycling but I hate people like this ruining the hard work of others. She was initially arrested but some of the lawsuits were dropped. I wonder why there were no officials preventing this
Next time, give the cyclists a machete so they can hack human obstacles like her.
Love it.
Her smile soon to be gone, being sued by the organisers. Someone that dumb, wonder how well they're doing financially...
She should change her name to Jenna Side since she almost wiped out an entire race. 🙄🤦🏼‍♂️🤣
got arrested for making a bike race entertaining...😄😆😆😆😆😆
I miss Lance. Our roided up guy beat the other roided up guys. Bring it back 😂
死刑！！！！！！！
Bush did it 100%
I’ve seen this kind of thing before. A moron photographer did the same thing a few years back. These guys have trained for years for this event and you have caused them to crash because you are a self centered idiot. Bravo!
What a sociopathic terrible "human" being, causing such a mass crash just because she wanted her 15 minutes of fame, this could've only been worse if she intentionally caused the crash to get on television. However the fact that she just ran away after this crash is proof enough that she certainly lacks "humanity" how do you cause a mass crash like this and not even try to help people on scene. Honestly if you're smart enough to write on a sign and to hold that sign to a camera how could you NOT be smart enough to know that stepping onto the road with a giant sign like that could cause trouble, even if it had just been a guy avoiding the sign on reflex....
Wtf just happened in the head of that woman !  I watched this in 2021, 6 million views, let's come back in 5 years and see what YouTube made of this video
But I mean... did he think he could just go through her like a ghost? I would have scream "Get the f*** out my way dumba**!!! Pardon my French"
i don’t think opi and omi are going to be happy
Soab
Should stay on his own side of the road
mvp: tony's helmet, def saved some brain cells there
hipster scuum
Formula 1: "I am the most exciting race ever" Tour De France: "Hold my beer"
I think people/spectator's are deliberately sabotaging the race and should be fined .
This is exactly what you don't want to do as a time traveler
Ahahahah beautiful
Least something happened.  As a spectator sport its just dull. It's just blokes spending the day riding in the countryside.  Then a mile from the end they decide to have a race.
He had a “Omi” sign lol the crypto token that supports the nft app “VeVe”
Il doit y avoir une frontière entre l'athlète et l'idiot qui ne pense qu'à lui. C'est la clé de la sécurité et de la paix.
Why can fans get so close? The organisers need to question themselves
They should have to pay to repair her sign
She looks so happy before the crash, afterwards she disappeared real quick. This is sad and hilarious at the same time😅. We need to publicly shame her for life.
THIS IS SOME INTERNET HISTORIAN MATERIAL.
2:02 She's nowhere to be seen later in the video. Figures, total irresponsibility.
Best thing I’ve watched 🤣🤣 Couldn’t happen to a more deserving bunch of self serving, road hogging inconsiderate tossers! Nice work lady with the cardboard sign.👍🏻👍🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣
what is wrong here? it is a dangerous hobby this
Her feet were planted on the asphalt when she was assaulted by the wayward cyclists.
Hope she's thrown in jail!!!
😆🤣🤣🤣 that what yall get. Biking is stupid
思ってたより大惨事でびっくりした 看板おばちゃんさぁ…
People are self centered,  spoiled,  attention seeking iddiots these days. I'm surprised she wasn't run over trying to take a selfie. We are a doomed race.
Idk why this is the most infuriating thing to see. I don't follow this sport. Where am I.
I must say this is quite fun and ironic though, considering the amount of cyclists that has never showed an ounce of regard for others in traffic. It's like the entire worlds karma came crashing down on this one day. ='D
I’m reminded of Dave Chapelle: “ So I kicked her in the pu$$y!”
I'm proud of her
She did it intentionally!  Nothing is that stupid.
Una verdadera imbécil a la que el resto de los espectadores deberías haber detenido en el momento, y si me apuran, también darle una buena paliza. Las cosas por su nombre.
👍
🤣😂😂🤣
Sign holder: “should have gone around”
Bloody cyclists!
And this is why, as a society, we have so many “stupid” rules. Perfect example of the lowest common denominator ruining it for everyone else.
I feel like breaking someone's nose..
If one fan can bring down the mob, the mob is 100% at fault.
She should be banned from any Tour lol. She forgot she's _not the cameraman_
WHAT IF! this wasn’t an accident - but planned? who can’t hear an army of cyclists approaching! she had her arm extended way into the street! there is no way this was only an “accident” look at the video, look at how far she had her arm out (ignore the sign)
They could call this a feature and add more obstacles to make the racing more interesting.
They were lucky that it was only a stupid fan.
There was a shoe and bike wheel, cyclists hurt, damage to bikes. How selfish to stand in the way of a group of cyclists endangering lives and jeopardising the race after all their hard work and training.
What does the sign say?
Clueless fan
Again lol.
Lol
Here's some  injuries a Peloton can't be blamed for
stupidasninja
Not entire peloton, fake news.
Best thing to happen to this drug fuelled excuse of a sport n
She stupid lol
When we learn to drive cars we learn to not follow closely to the driver in front of us because it’s dangerous.
Esas carreras tienen mas trampas y drogas que la politica ......
Looks like the democrat party crashing into their own stupidity
If you wanna dance, you have to pay for it
Watch more Tour de France  Crash videos : https://shrinke.me/instgrame
All I can hear is Urkel asking, "Did I do thaaaat?"
So what did the sign say? "Sh*t Happens"?
She must be in jail for her stupid action
I hope this stupid woman will be on the jail and pay the sportsmans for pain!

Bonsoir à tous , Qui a eu le Covid-19 ? Bisous 😘
All that training and doping only to get taken down by a fan.
Killtacular
😱😱😱
Absolute ignorance and stupidity of that woman!!!
Behold the karen of karenville has been crowned. All bow
I think she is guilty Go to jail!!!!!!
Hahaha.
Anyone know if she was arrested?
Woman Moment
Just a woman in her way
I feel bad for the entire situation, but I would be ashamed to be such a strong athlete, and not tighten up, and bull through that cardboard sign
what i dont understand is that you have to be very committed biking fan to go all the way out to a spot to watch the tour de france riders, for what 10 seconds total until they ride past you. BUT she isn´t even doing that, she went all the way out there waited for hours, and the when the riders finally came to her spot she chose to hold up a sign instead and was more focused on the camera than the race??? that makes zero sense
Tour de Pavement, 2021
The World is full of such abject imbeciles today… 🤪🤩🥳 And they are multiplying exponentially…..
Welp i love to see this in my recommended videos in a few years
Ahhhh hahahaha. Fuckin funny as shit. This lady just fucked over like 100 people in 1 single second. Haha
Bad karma 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can I run over a bike going 15 mph in a 55 then?
Wow that cardboard is strong!   Solid Snake gonna need this cardboard box in Metal Gear Solid game.
The Steve Bartman of France. Sorry Steve 😔
Baffles me that people were that close to the track. I’ve had to tell parents off in children’s athletic events to get off of the track. We had to pause for 15 minutes because a parent refused and screamed at me while I politely asked everyone to scoot back because they’re in a lane. Almost into two lanes.   The headteacher had to step in and reprimand them infront of spectators because of their disgusting behaviour. I was like 16 running an event we had to set up for our exams.   You can blame the organisers too for allowing people to be that close to the track but people like to be run over  and insert themselves into events.
Allez!
The year 2020 in a nutshell
Ban cycling its too dangerous.
Cycling is dumb anyway
She was paid to do that to direct more media attention
It only takes one i***t...

What does the sign even say?
🐸  🚴‍♂️ 🤦🏻‍♀️
Bikers fault, should look forward
Probably one of those feminists nutters protesting about the lack of gender, racial and sexual equity in sport. And more money for women etc.
This will come down in history as the Heysel Disaster of Cycling
Not going to lie. I didn't even know the Tour de France was on until I heard about this.
She just vanished 😂
Hope she can salute to her grandparents from jail, pretty soon
I blame the cyclist how did he not see her she was like a giant banana standing there
What doesn the sign say??
💔👎😵😭😖😠🙉
*AWOLNATION Run* is what the lady started hearing as soon as it happened.
Nuclear
She's the type of person to sue the car if she crashed
Anybody know what her sign says
Funny
Pwned!
I didn't know Black Sabbath's former singer was into biking.
Haha love it.
I think it’s Trumps fault
This woman should be named and shamed. I hope she will get a custodial sentence. Attention seeking women like this must be stopped as she has caused serious injury to others.
That's why we need barriers between the riders and the fans.
The London Marathon has barriers from start to end. Not sure why this isn't incorporated in the Tour de France especially in the rural areas.
Humans are incredibly dangerous - Keep the flock away from them !!!!!
This comment is for the People who will be recommended this randomly in 2025. Hi.
Awesome... no one likes cyclists 👊👊🖕
She looks so silly
The woman’s stupidity is beyond words, but why didn’t her fellow spectators stop her?
I admit, I probably would have done something that stupid also, not even aware of the cyclists...sometimes people aren't thinking when they have bright "ideas" :)  what is she getting charged with though?  reckless endangerment?  assault? what would be the actual charge for that
The sign says "Go grandpa/grandma"
and i thought kpop fans were toxic
Most entertaining bit of the race.
Stupid fun. Year of preparations and at the end this happened.
Fun Fact, the person who cause this is American tourist
Widen the road lol
Woman moment
Was he even looking ahead?
I dont think I'll ever watch this and not smile 😀😀
Reminds me of the scene from GoldenEye where Bond makes all the cyclists fall lol
This would have been even more brilliant if the sign read ‘Watch This’.
Ah, a woman bringing down men, what's new about that?
Really unfortunate consequences to her actons, but also a very stupid thing to do.
Karen at it again
Where did she go after this?
Typical weekend warrior rider thinking he's in the Tour de France.....if he had real skills he would have avoided this scenario.
1 lady more interested in her self CAUSED this !
那個白癡路人..............
I was here see you in 10 years
I love a good lynching like the rest of us, it feels good to be angry and direct it at something, but let's remember that one act of stupidity devoid of spiteful intent is not worthy of such hate.   I hope this woman learns from this and it doesn't destroy her entire life. Life is so very long and I don't wish upon her that.  Maybe I am getting soft. Just thought I should say it. This is the sort of thing that could drive a person to suicide intentional or chemical.
Imagine getting famous for all the bad reasons😬😂
How to fuck Tour? Put a french women with a cardbord in front of they peloton! Great...done
Never see a so huge idiot
It kinda looked like joe Binden in drag....
Tony Martin forgot to ring the bell!
I paid her to blocked the entire road
Wonderful sight. A big thanks from everyone that gets stuck behind these absolute cretins on the roads every weekend. Shame you missed some drug addicts.. sorry I mean cyclists at the front. Better luck next time
Fine the guy the amount the bikes got damaged for
Everybody blames this spectator. But, realistically, these crashes happen all the time, at the slightest perturbation: a bug flies into a cyclist's eyes, a pebble is hit on the road. They are all packed in so insanely closely together, it's ridiculous!
What a plank.
Woman moment
WHAT DID THE SIGN SAY?
They kidnaped the wrong person's dog. Hello Microsoft
Stupidity indeed
The look and the smile on her face….i mean you just cant make this shit up
Bule ada yg norak juga rupanya
That is the first time that woman got touched by something for a long time.
I am surprised that she didn't ask to see the manager.
super spreader plague race
There all stuck and grumpy 😾 😑 😒
Be careful what you become famous for
ESPN 30 for 30 coming in the near future.😂
"Things like this attract people towards the sport". I like it.
I don't know.......... I feel like I would have just knocked her down and kept on peddling I'm not a professional cyclist so really I don't know... But it almost looks like he pulled a LeBron James and just pretended to get hit harder than it actually was??
I hope the banner is ok
This is the Tour de France... Bring back the guillotine!
Man that new Looney Tunes episode looks so good with the new graphics! Finally we know a way to stop Roadrunner too.
I can't even imagine what profanities the live viewers were shouting after this
This woman is now in the same level as D.B. Cooper for the cycling community
This woman is the reason why the power rangers have to say their names EVERY GODDAMN EPISODE
She’s a hero in Australia Fuck cyclists
like dominos
Entire?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
cardboardMan
The Tour de France organisation wont sue because every team involved want a piece of her. Lol
I think it is time for the cycling race organizers and international associations to seriously think about drafting rules around the erecting of barriers at start/end and highly populated areas and choke points e.g. city centers and highly urban areas. I live in Cape Town and every year we host the largest amateur cycle race in the World. The organizers utilize a mixture of solid fencing and plastic mesh fencing throughout urban roads. Obviously one cannot fence an entire race, but organizers will know the really popular spectator vantage points. I cringed when I saw cyclists riding over each other! At the speeds these cyclists are going at they can really cause serious damage to riders and spectators.
People are all angry. Chill out, nobody died. I thought it was funny.
Oh a girl
She should go to prison.
Fun fact : The women is about to spend at a maximum of two years in jail
Stupid spectator 😒
As they say " stick your group set up your peloton and have a Campagnolo of a day "
So? She had a sign. Lets see when she post it. Someone knows her.
Women...
If you ask me it's just part of the world nowadays and should be just part of the course 😂 would make the race ten times more interesting.
I don’t even watch cycling and I hate that lady. What a moron. Maybe she was hired by the other team?!
If only there would've been signs for fans to not have signs blocking the race.
Was She arrested and put to trial? Cause she should!
Cyclist should have let go of handle bar with just that hand to push her arm out of the way? Might have worked? I don't know...
She's a cross between Waldo and Carmen San Diego... No one will ever find her
One idiot fans 🥴
Stupidity and narcissism at its finest.
She extended her arm to the road along with her sign, because her low-IQ-entitled-pedestrian-ass believe the cyclers will have to yield to her.
One of the funniest things I've ever seen. Classic😂😂
Send her to court and not allow her to reproduce! Please!
Lolz.  Also, I love how everyone is willfully forgetting how "Tour de France" was a total sham for decades with scummy doped up riders getting the podium and top 15 places. That guy probably took out the most doped up riders at the front. At least we will get to watch a fair race.
It was not her intention to cause a crash, she basically held a sign to greet her grandparents, and made a terrible mistake for being so close to the path. I believe that she should be punished for her negligence and for fleeing the scene... but all these hate comments that I read here I believe are just too much....
Good. Screw them. Boohoo their dumb little bikes fell. Dreadful people
Can the fans face fines for this kinda stuff or na?
Anyone translate the sign?
One of those bikes cost somewhere around $17,000 each, that's a lotta damage!
Im trying to understand how a flimsy cardboard sign knock him off though?
Pelle peloton
This woman should go to prison for reckless endangerment.
She shud do that in mans TT racing...
😓
We need to put her in jail
Find her
Dégueulasse
A vomir
Insupportables
She troll
She is a wore
Unlike EVERY OTHER PERSON, this lady is in a full on disguise. Her outfit is more like a costume. Everyone around her is dressed normal. But she is in a ton of layers with her hair, face shape, and eyes obscured. So what is really going on here?
Vittuu sen kyltin kanssa XD
Two riders abandoned the tour because of this idiot. One of them, from Movistar, with both arms broken
The guy in the red shirt is on steroids.
Well they found her,1500 euro ticket penalty...and 1 cyclist team want to call her on court
I keep returning to this video to check the comments if they found her.
Poor Karen!…must have taken her hours to make that sign.. only to be destroyed in seconds by some maniac on a bicycle!😂🚴🏼
any reward posted yet for information about the lady in yellow???
This is what happens when ordinary individuals are allowed to possess military grade cardboard. No one needs that much firepower
Democrat for sure
That was a stupid woman i'd ever see
Quick update :  After 3 days of searches, the lady who's responsible for this incident who absconded first,  felt guilty and surrender to Police. She was put into custody 48h and released after Tour de France's organizers dropped the suit against her.
That woman   with placard  should  pay  for  all kind  of damage and  trauma she caused,  only  thus way such  people  would  think twice before done such stupid  things.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any nation with cardboard signs in their military arsenal, needs the upmost respect.
Why don't Covid-19 authoritarian and totalitarianism Governmental officials practice their need for validation by keeping these idiot Fans lining the tour paths well out of the way  from the street and the Peloton?
Why she on the run, that was an accident but it wernt illegal?🤷🏿‍♂️. Fuckit. #LOCKHERUP #LOCKHERUP
Lmao dude was looking in the camera without flitchin
they've found Wanda!...
stupid
We should make this a urban legend if shes never found
They went down easier than a load of footballers It was a bit of cardboard
She should be fined, I'm surprised no-one was killed.... what was the outcome of that part of the race anyway?
la honte de porter plainte, des bêtes et des démons en troupeaux serrés!!!!
What does that sign say ?
The roadway should be cleared period!!! Barriers should be set up. Unbelievable!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA    AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
What did the sign even say.
I know I shouldn’t but I laugh
Brilliant 🤩
Amateur cyclists be watching this then go out on single carriageways and become human roadblocks
ALLEZO OPI OMI😘
Fun fact: The woman turned herself in incase you didn't know. 👍🏼 She wasn't charged either, at least by the Tour de France team.
This women should be Banned For Life for attending the Tour De France 🇫🇷.  How stupid can this women be.  She ruins the entire tour for men who have trained years for this one event.
We all make silly mistakes sometimes. Some mistakes we get away with and others………
The person taking that photo of the sign holding fan could have said something. I mean, they at least saw what was coming.
She should be banned for life and in jail. She caused a shit load of people to get hurt and who knows how much in damages and then ran from the police. Needs to be jail time.
I’m from 2021 who in 2031?
Kinda the Tour's fault to be honest. I understand the fans are generally good and respectful, but it's only a matter of time before one person fucks everything up. This is why you place barriers here.
The Tour has decided to drop all charges against her. If local law enforcement follows suit, she'll have gotten away with it, with no repercussions. 😳
She on the run!🏃🏻‍♀️
Did anyone slap her?
Loool they found her
A cardboard sign took 'em down?
I bet she is a wonderful "texter while driving".
Is it bad that I think its funny somehow?
She’s was posing for a pic. Probably for her Instagram. GO SOCIAL MEDIA PSYCOS you all are disgrace to the new generation
I can't tell you how much I enjoyed seeing these assholes go down!!!
Nooooo thats Redicolus !
Now she can tell her kids what was the most dumb thing she ever did.
Not a fan, that folks is an ass@#%$
Someone knows who that was. Give it up.
How did that guy even wreck?....It was cardboard not a 2x4
There are too many dumb people on this earth, there needs to be boundaries.
Bet she was a Lesbian. Total lesbian like thing to do. Not know where your sign starts and stops. Why does she have her leg on the course. Lesbian like way to stand!
Id like to buy her a pint
Useless illiterate, ignorant lady. Put her in jail for 10 years.😡😡😡
She fucked it up for a ton of people. But man, it was funny as fuck...
Doom kicked in the woman's mind
That would of caused more strain on the NHS than Coronavirus if that was in the UK. Because of that lady and her sign the whole country is under tremendous strain and people can't see GPs!
That’s the type of woman to get mad at the bikers for hitting her
That was intentional, it had to be!
あのクソガキを許すな！
In Francia si dice " sta grandissima zoccola"
She turned herself in.
Arresteren en alle schade verhalen op dat volkomen gestoorde wijf
Allez I'm in jail now opi omi
I enjoyed this! It’s a bit of a guilty pleasure and I’m very happy no one was seriously injured, but I kinda can’t stand cyclists! I hate they get to ride their bicycle wherever they want to! It’s a law that need to really change. Certainly since we have automobiles that travel at high speeds.
Serves them right anyways.  Cycling is the gayest thing on the planet, and these speedo boys cause traffic accidents and deaths all the time, just because they're too cool to take their shit on a bike trail.
She may face prison time apearently
Would anybody still be talking about this race if this didnt happen.
Why are the bikes so close together in the first place? and then you put dumb and dumber together and what do you expect?
Lay off she is obviously a simple soul .
What the fuck was she doing anyways bruh
Mountain bikers look at that and think: "Puny cardboard". Jokes aside, terribile crash....there should be more safety and control over the spectators, this Is sure one way to ruin the day and send many to the hospital.
Does she have some gambling connections...?
Le gros débil avec sa pancarte
Solo hay una palabra para esto.... ESTUPIDEZ !!
She's not interested in the sport She just wanna be on tv lol
Is she still missing.?
Ha ha Love to see this Sick and tired of exercise bicyclists on the road. Should be illegal since the roads are meant for transportation not working  on your cardio.
The real crime here is the rider couldn’t ride through a flimsy piece of cardboard.
ALEZOPI-OMI
This is the most 2021 thing I've seen.
That spectator needs a brain. And the ciclist, new pair of eyes.
Hahahdhaha your correct she was dressed like Wheres Waldo
What a moroon
Ngeri juga, gak kebayang jika ada disana gimana
Hilarious!!!!! Well done that girl!!!!!
Reminds me of the marching band in the movie Animal House when they reached the end of the alley.
Omg
Damn if only this happened more in Tour De France and NASCAR more people would probably enjoy it
So dumb
She will never be found. What a shame
How bloody stupid. Apparently, she's just handed herself in. Defies belief. Wasn't even facing the riders.
hahahahahah
What a numpty!!!!
This should be considered a crime against humanity. She isn't even a fan of the sport!      Is the Guillotine still a valid practice there in France?
Women 😑
Bet she is a Brexiteer
White Folks ...smh
A perfect example of a strong and brave woman.
Clearly, another violent atack against women. Heteropatriarchy strike again!!
Peloton marketing team: let's take a look at this idea for our next campaign...
there will be a lot of motorists out there putting money aside to help the hero if shes ever found
Looks just as intelligent as an ANTIVA / BLM protester.  A senseless idiot without a cause.
It was a cardboard sign,how did he fall
Thats very Goodyear.
Traduzindo a mensagem: "Sou gado do mito"
Most impressive is the person doesnt let the sign go - i just keep holding on to it - the whole world wanna kick your ass.
that girl doesn't save her self and very danger
The organizers' mistake when they both allow so many cyclists and to have the audience so close. Road safety certainly does not apply to these pompous demigod cyclists.
Aonde estavam os organizadores que permitiram o público ficar dentro das pistas? Sim tem que haver Regras.
Vraiment une imbécile!
That woman vanished like Joe Biden on the campaign trail
I think the next sign under her chin will contain numbers.
0:50 Piece of flimsy cardboard causes entire peloton to crash.
Another narcissist with a stupid sign.
Ofcourse woman..
Glad they chose not to press charges since she turned herself in. Had she not then ok
El mundo está lleno de imbéciles que solo quieren visibilidad.
Most interesting thing In cycling next to lance Armstrong
What a madlad
Don’t the handle bars steer the bike????? I could be wrong??????
Kinda wish the cyclist ran into her full speed so the only place she'd be running to would be the hospital
This woman should be praised, she actually made something exciting happen in cycling.
“Fan at the side of road, got absolutely fucked, shouldn’t have been there” is probably the quote of the century 1:02
Women.... easy narcissists.
大 迷 惑 コントなら笑えるけど、これは酷すぎる
Not her fault. Tony Stupidly ran into a non-moving object, Tony is to blame.
Aww you can tell she's a fermented peanut of a person .   Classic Pleb
these days.. women and camera.. women would kill to be in from of them.. camera on, brain of..
She finally got arrested
Women...
She don't care about people,she don't care if some body hurt. She care only of herself and of popularity. I will don't care if she will go in prison. People can't injury other people without consequences. They training a lot of time for this race
Girl- i just stand there the cycling hit me Cameraman- now  you famous!
I think she was arrested 😬🤭
So are France’s Guillotines still functional?
We partake in a miniscule amount of tomfoolery
We need this woman on the streets of London 🤣
Madame CONASSE qui n'assume pas et se barre !
Woman ANIHILATES entire peloton, sounds like a Call of Duty clickbait
This look funny but it isn't
Hahaha
Put that women in jail immediately 😤😤😡😡🤬🤬
Imagine being upset about a bike wreck
She would like to speak to the manager of tour de france
Or she's stupid or did that on purpose 😒
What did the sign say?????
Just stupid! Lol😂
What did the sign say
The woman was not sued !!
The sign said “I’m one stupid bitch”
This goes out to all those "cyclists" thinking your all badasses blocking traffic. Hilarious, as long as no one got hurt
French Karen With A Sign
What is it with people? What a moron
Donald Trumps Daughter ? 😡
Lmfao that’s messed up
That makes more buz than the sporting event itself  Greetings from Occitania
Best way she could escape detection is to ride a bike everywhere, saying she hates the spectator for what she did during the tour
Mr Bean would be proud
Fantastic
You are not alone, you are not unlovable, you are not worthless. You are a wonderful creation. You have a plan and purpose for your life - a bright future and a hope. Jesus loves you very much. Material things don’t satisfy, there is MORE to life, trust in God today. Believe in Jesus  and you will be given eternal life, purpose and fulfilment. You got this. God is calling you, will you respond? You can do it -it’s never too late ♥️
The moment i saw the news, i knew its a woman who caused this crash.
A true hero did what I have only dreamed of doing 👏
There are going to be a lot of happy people if the idiot with sign is hurt.
*How to fuck up your life in 20 seconds or less.*
This affair takes on impossible proportions, it shows that it did not do it on purpose. She just wanted to send a message to her grandparents
$340,000 worth of bikes destroyed because of some doofus with a sign, LMAO. Frickin epic !!
Where s she now?????
"I fell cause of a Cardboard sign, My Vagina hurts! I also caused a pile up"
The most exciting thing to ever happen at the tour.
You’d probably jump in front of cars on a highway too.
This is a major🤦🤦 moment.
europeans are funny folks
WTF, did the sign say anyway?  I can only guess the translation is, "shit happens."
One side effect from certain vaccines is impaired judgement....hmmm 🛑🙈🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲
She should have been at home making criossants.
2:02 boom 💥   🤣she has lots of enemies now
LOL ... tooooo funny ...
This was done purposely! It is so obvious, the one in yellow jacket holding a sign.
She did that on porpoise, she tried to put so much effort into holding that sign out in front of the racers
Idiot
Tabrakan beruntun
Jesus loves you
She could have taken a few steps back from the road and her sign would've been seen just fine.. But that wouldn't have been good enough for her.. She's THAT special.
🙈🙈🙈🙈
Cars 2021 xd
I’m sorry but this shit is hilarious I can’t stop watching it over and over
If you've got a powerful telescope apparently you can see her holding a  SORRY sign stood on the moon.
Stupid people make stupid things...I hope every ciclers will be ok
pretty classic, stupid woman just wants to be famous and see herself on camera ruins the lifes of millions of men
I need that fan to come to the horse races with me.
Oh no! Anyway
Why wouldn’t they simply redo the whole race? There should be someone who can asses situations and decide what to do like at least stop everyone at their spot until everyone gets up.
these races should be idiot proof  5 feet away from road and have police throw a beating to any violators with a baton .
The mirror crashed?
Absolute mistake by the spectator.  Cyclists are made out of cotton. Easy to be taken down by a piece of cardboard     In the end have some respect for the competitors and their racing space.
She's been arrested
I can see her saying “Did I do that?”
She name !?
A grown man on a bicycle gets taking out by a piece of cardboard
Sh!t riders running into stationary objects then blaming the stationary objects... Too much EPO effecting vision.
They broke my sign is probably what she thinks. Only a person up in her arse can do this.
Name and shame that person
She should lose everything she owns. Especially after running and hiding. Wonder if her arm is broken. Idiot.
They didn't keep Safe social distance?
Bahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahah
I feel so bad for the first couple people that fell they got crushed I’d say
She shouldn’t be let off that easily
The world is becoming a parody of itself.
What an idiotic thing to do
How fast she run after crashing..
That’s typical European daily life ;)))) “ oh I want this! I think it’s right for human” Go for it, life is yours ;)))
This is a spandex fruitcakes dream. A pile of dude's wearing spandex on top of each other....
LOL, never the cyclists fault.
わろけるw
She was found and is arrested, , facing 1,500 euro fines
if you could only have found waldo a few seconds ahead...
Just to tell that you are a single mother....
I hope the signs ok !
Damn...........
And yet they crashed again later as well
That's what they get for starving Haiti after the haitian revolution.
👉 0:48 　📂 💥 🚲🚲🚲
Clouds overtake a European Soccer field and they all fall in agony!
hahahahahahahahahahahaha
And this is why the highway code quotes braking distance and thinking distance for road users. Dimwits.
I hope the woman is caught and sentenced....
It's hilarious and I don't know why people are taking it so seriously
People are sofa king stupid
I wouldn’t be surprised if she turns out to be a feminist activist 🤪
Well her message will definitely be seen by millions of people
Charged them!
The day a small piece of cardboard wreaked havoc on humanity, the sign, like COVID completely harmless, but if you put it on TV, becomes formidable.
Seems like it was an honest mistake to me. Still this lady will be sacrificed to the cycling god Miguel Induráin.
Why do i feel like shes a time traveler who just prevented WW3 from happening. Think of it if someone lost the tour de france. Maybe he will become the next hitler the same way hitler didnt go to artschool. So maybe we just came in a different timeline. Where world war 3 didnt happen. The butterfly effect.
Why don’t these cyclist keep some safe distance from each other? Isn’t there a law for keeping safe distance when riding on the road?
Hope that poor lady didn't get hurt. Bloody cyclists think they own the road!
Funny shit
This is where the fun ends. From now on, the fans will be 25 feet back.
Today's activist for ya. Dumb as an ox and living a life of irony, double standards, and hypocrisy.
Stupid Paddington bear. Needed to be seen or heard.. Couldn't just enjoy the race..
Nice real life domino
Fan had every right to her freedom of expression. Sad everyone talking down on that person
Lmao. These are the Tour updates I look forward to.
Card board is now banned in France.
I'm glad they arrested her.
4chan will probably find her.
📣 LOOKING LIKE  WHEN THE SPERM CELLS REALIZED  IT'S ONLY A BLOWJOB!😆
Sad tht this is the most intresting thing in a bike race in 20 years, lol
This is what you get when you teach your kids they can be anything they want and everyone's a winner.
It looks like the rider turned into the sign, hit loose dirt or mud, off the pavement, then lost went down.
I can't figure out why the rider went down when hitting a cardboard sign.
all this for most likely a social media picture. What a total dummy. Typical
And there's the Euro Gump stupid is as stupid does. Still as true in 2021.
Purtroppo la madre degli idioti è sempre incinta!!
Que mulher burra
An Idiot woman must be punished
Who would win, an elite athlete or one cardy boi?
Now that's funny!
They need to have little bells to ring to tell people to get out of the way !
Wouldn't have happened if they were 2 m apart
Definitely done on spite! The fan was looking into the camera!
Attention seeking idiot should come forward for more attention....
Misleading title - the entire peloton did not crash  Get the facts straight!
Here is my take on this: Tony Martin wasnt even looking at the road. He got that SURPRISED face when he was half a meter away from her cardboard sign, and that shocked him and steared into the peleton. If anybody is to blame it's him imo. She was standing outside the road, and yes, her sign was slightly into the road, but it was just a thoughtless action, and it happens all the time, and normally it's not a problem, but here the riders went so far out on the side and Tony didnt pay attention at all. This witch hunt to track her down and arrest her is horrible. The people arranging this is trying to take focus away from their own responsibility and blame some fan. If you look at the pictures she was even standing outside the white line and on the grass as well, not inside the road.
Oh no, the fight's out I'mma 'bout to punch yo lights out!  Move b##ch, get out the way Get out the way b##ch, get out the way Move b##ch, get out the way Get out the way b##ch, get out the way  That was Ludacris!!
The FBI is supposing the supporter to be involved in the Kennedy’s murder in a way
JJAAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA XDDD
Blind cyclist? Why? Never had them in old days
pure stupidly there's way 2 many cyclists cramped together
I wonder how many of those cyclists are lawyers lol
Tour de France withdraws lawsuit against spectator who caused crash with sign https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/tour-de-france-withdraws-lawsuit-against-spectator-who-caused-crash-with-sign/
Hilarious. I heard the culprit has now done a runner
This is for everytime a cyclist goes 20 on a backroad meant for 50
Lol
Np120jb
Do morons feel like morons when they realize that they are a Moron?
It would have to take all patience that my brain can muster up to not punch her square in the face.
I Wonder What she thought was gonna happen..
2:02
The retards of today are not the retards of yesteryear.
Thats great All that impotent meat on the floor 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Hi me of the future
They found her and arrested her...i hope she gets a big fine or some equivalent punishment and is banned for life
Half the screen is yellow, wtf.
🙄🤦‍♂️James Blunt springs to mind 😉
0:15 The Lady after making the accident at tour de france be like: *DOUBLE KILL* *TRIPLE KILL* *KILLTROCITY* *KILLIONAIRE* *UN-FRIGGIN-BELIEVABLE* *BE THE BULLET* *YOUR TEAM HAS TAKEN THE LEAD* I hope everyone is okay execpt for the Lady Who did this
This is the reason Tesla keeps updating their Software 😂
Ho la connasse! XD
It was that silly lady with her Primark bag 🙄
these athletes ride like they are made out of rice paper
No women no cry...
What an IDIOT. Lock it up and throw away the key. Prison awaits lady - they will find you.
What did the sign say ????
200 cyclists on a 3 meter wide road with no crowd control.  What could possibly go wrong
00:49 for the takedown
I bet her name is karen....
スーパー密
Best moment of the Tour le France.
Meanwhile aliens watching this from outer space "is this what they call an intelligent species?"
female intelligence!  no comments!
Too busy looking at the damn camera!
Thanks to her ! THANKS ! Again !!!!
Jail her for a few years, make an example of the fan, teach other spectators to respect the peleton
😅😂🤣😂😅this is the only time I ever watched Tour de France
Most hated women  right now in France 🤦
I bet she did a quick-change after the crash and will never be identified. lollll
I was today years old when I learned what Peloton means.
Do you think whoever did it walked off whistling like they didn't do anything 😁
a low pass fighter jet breaking the sound barrier would  have been a good follow up.
Update:According to BFMTV, a French news station, the woman was arrested Wednesday in Finistere, in northwest France, not far from the crash site. Her name wasn’t released.  She has reportedly been charged with causing unintentional injuries and endangering the lives of others, and possibly fined.
So that’s what a Peloton is….
Sign reads;  "Keep cycling and save the planet" Oops,
That person could have taken a life!! That person definitely took someone’s career. What stupidity!!
I see her from the aerial view. She's hidden in the grassy knoll.
Next OnlyFans superstar.
Shes been arrested now, shes being sued now. HA
What a complete loser. “Look at me! Look at me!”
Tour de crash
next time don't wear a yellow jacket....
She has been arrested.
Mais quelle conne celle la
You've been instagranned
That’s hilarious! 😄 cyclists  really milking it
Cyclist runs down a padestrian on a public road.....who should be charged with an offence
This will be a momentary great for the sport of cycling. Now some people who don't care about it will pay attention to the tour de france for a few moments because of this crash.  Granted it won't last long, but still.
Ye kya sabzi Mandi bana rakha hai
Being the type of person who HATES these douche bag bikers who are always slowing down traffic and trying to shame us with their tight little spandex outfits, I find this to be one of the most satisfying videos I have EVER seen!
これは酷い
He saws her and drives forward ...
Yikes... I hope everyone is ok.
Downed by a flimsy piece of card.
why is this the funniest shit ever
what a dumb muffin cruncher. she was a typical moon biscuit trying to get on tv.
What does that sign say?
Did the cardboard say RIP in the thumbnail
Eh, they will do a movie about her....idiots! Freaking cow high tailed it out of there afterwards. Hope this follows her everywhere.
I hope Tony Martin got a decent elbow in.
😅😅
No, it didn't cause the ENTIRE pelaton to crash ......... 🤨🙄
everyone wants to be on camera. It’s pathetic. She’s pathetic
Turns out this was actually a "Wanna Get Away?" marketing campaign. Well played Southwest...well played.
Why can't they keep Spectators away from the edge of the ROAD ❓ This is " STUPID" 💯 Out of Control , Crazy ,, LMAO 💯
Excellent!
There should be barriers u can't blame her for that
This is better Drafting than NASCAR but , the WRECKS  are the SAME with most of the field going DOWN💯
This just shows how one stupid person can cause massive chaos.
Cyclists always think they own the road
Ban bikes!!!!! For their own safety!!!!! 😂😂😂
Anyone translate the sign?
Its wasn't even the sign, it was her whole god damn arm in the road.
hmm maybe, just maybe, this sport is stupid & everyone involved is an idiot
What’s the sign say?
The most entertaining thing to happen in cycling since its inception 😂
That person was thinking about that sign and moment for weeks. I'm sure they didn't think about this part.
All should have ridden over her
Who is here after her news of being arrested?
I mean, I wonder if she’s deaf? How can you have such little awareness of THOUSANDS OF BIKES coming straight towards you. Obviously stupid but just wonder if there were any other factors at play. Wouldn’t wanna be her right now...
She got arrested.
Miss Bean
Well, she's basically Hitler, i mean she invaded France & tried to take out an entire race
the crash of the tour
because of dummies like that they will say no more fans on the side of the roads
Hahhahhahhaha class
This is so unfair.   The poor woman had her sign broken by a bunch of reckless cyclists.
la conne
Where was she hitching a lift to ?
Lol I know this is fucked but I found it funny how some of the dudes that stopped pretended to be concerned and then sorta did a double take and hauled ass to get back on their bikes like…..”hmmmm niceeeee, get me a nice lead here if I’m quick.” Lol
What a FUCKING STOOGE!  And might I point out- The first man down got SMOKED by the guy behind him- AND the guy behind HIM as well, I’m guessing. That looked really painful. I’m sensing a personal injury lawsuit in someone’s future.
That's why I hate stupid people with a passion...
This video is funnier if you turn on the benny hill theme on the background 😂
She was posing hard for her Instagram account, totally oblivious to her surroundings.
Now that is funny!!
Hahahahahahaha!!!!  I cant stop laughing!!
This extremely stupid woman should be harshly punished. Apparently she is not interested in the tour but only in being on TV. At least 5000-10000€ should be the penalty to warn other narcissistic idiots in such events.
Domino Dayyyyyyy 😅 jokes apart, gosh how stupid people can be 🤦‍♂️
Some misfit out for attention, like the Oath Keepers.
I can't believe that cyclist and the entire peloton took out her sign. Prices!
I'm more surprised that a piece of cardboard took down a full-grown man. Looks like a soccer or basketball flop.
Good police find her to explain how stupid gesture to hit and run she have made !
Imagine in the next tour de france, people just wear bright yellow jackets, not trying to disrupt anything, but just wearing it
That looked DELIBERATE.
Give this women a medal!!
It wasn't her sign, it was her arm that knocked the rider off the bike.
This is real comedy!
The yellow clothes.. tersangka utama
I am impressed that the cyclist to the left of the first to fall had reaction speed to avoid stepping on his neck
good
Well, she’s got her 15 minutes of fame. This video alone is over 5.5m views. What an idiot.
She was gone like the wind! Wow.
They came crashing down due to a piece of paper - Just like my hopes and dreams after university 😔
The cops have tracked her down! Stupid woman could face prison time
some peoples lack of intelligence. -.- Where is Dawin when you need him?
How about you take your gigantic watermark off of a video you don’t own so I can actually see them crashing
She's like the zodiac killer. Shows up, fucks shit up, disappears
imagine all the months of hard work and preparation. only for some random biker destroying your sign.
이렇게 큰 경기인데 펜스 하나 없다는 것도 신기하네...
*Tour De Cardboard*
hahah sucked in! Who would of thought riding up peoples shit pipe could cause such an accident.
I would have punched her as I approached and then took any fine for it. I rallying they used to allow fans to endanger themselves and the drivers but now keep barriers up.   I was amazed how they are allowed to be so close when I saw the footage.
I have nothing to do with this sport and never watched it, but this women pissed me off so fucking hard.
Moist
Good women
Hope her photo op was worth it. Geez.
La stupidité d'une femme et non d'une fan.
Fan just got arrested. The fan has not been publicly identified. The sign the fan was holding said- Go Grandpa- Go Grandma. The organization planned to sue, so that the tiny minority of people who do this don't ruin the show for everyone.
She will be famous now. Might even have interviews on Ellen degenerate.
Initially I was pretty upset with her but now seeing the video, it was an honest mistake. She’s going to feel stupid for the rest of her life.
Haha excellent stuff.
she didnt mean it but really did some serious damage… poor girl… guess at least its good marketing for the tour.
It’s a cardboard sign Tony…
Book her Danno!
Allowing crowds THAT close to the riders, WTF did they think was going to happen???  FOOLS DE FRANCE!!!  They found her ass and, she is facing some stupid injury charge but, will be sued by the race...like she has money.  It's the race's fault, clearly.
Wtf...shouldnt do that plz mamm. Selfish
If this was a game of "Clue", she would be caught in a heartbeat.    "The woman in a yellow jacket with a cardboard sign"
So.. what did the lady's sign even say?
Just a heads up people, she's finally be arrested after 4 days on the run!
They've found her and she is being prosecuted for endangering life and so they should, this was the dumbest thing I've ever seen and how no one was killed I don't know,throw her in prison for a few years and teach her and any other idiots that lunacy like this will not be tolerated!!
SHE HAS BEEN FOUND!
What does her idiotic sign say?
This is worse than the time where the police escort on motorcycle caused a cyclist to crash
In your best Renée voice 'you stupid woman!'
It reminds me of those Southwest airlines wanna get away commercials.
Race organisers fault. Blaming the girl is the easy way out
Social Media is becoming the demise of the World, when people become so Dumbed Down and have No Understanding of what their Actions Cause either in Words or Deeds such as this disaster. This Woman should be held responsible for every $$$ lost in bike repairs and medical costs for every rider that she caused harm too, then put her in jail until she actually understands the results of her actions.
La dame vont ghigliottinee
She was eventually Caught,........She was on the Run but Authorities found her, wat an Idiot,...!
I would've loved if the camera just stayed on the fan so we could see what she did immediately after
boring sport but this was funny
Im sure shes proud ! These protesters every where are getting out of hand. All those people who worked to be in that race took out by a stupid little twit !  How awful.
Et on applaudit la débile de l année
We do a little trolling
Schadenfreude. I can't stop watching this lampoonish debacle.
Dumb sloots always have to be the center of attention, no matter the cost. "LOOK AT ME AND MY SIGN!!!! LIVE LAUGH LOVE!!! TEE HEE!!!!!! *CRAAAASH!!!*
Damn, those riders dropped harder than my GPA
Women..
She new she was out too far 😭😭😭😭
Opi omi!
All the injured cyclists should sue that woman and make her pay for their medical bills.
Grandma (Omi) & Grandpa (Opa) are looking at her like Kennedy looked at Marilyn Monroe when she sang Happy Birthday to him in front of his wife.
Clowns are beings very dangerous.
Darwin award winner right there 🙄
Whatever exploits she makes in her life, she will be considered an idiot for life. And I am sure she won't make any success in her life
Can't believe someone can find this funny!What she did is the biggest impudence, irresponsibility and lack of brain. Obviously she didn't care about people efforts to prepare for this event, don't give a **** if someone got ingured. First,I was going to say she's simply brainless, but  however she quickly realize that she need to escape from crime scene. So it's complete disregard of other people.
I think she must go to jail for this 3 years....
Surprized this does'nt happen every day on the tour,time some of those moron supporters got a grip.Makes me cringe every time i see them
She was arrested today 😀
I know who She was ,Angela Merkel.
It's ok she was just protesting while blocking the road it is permitted daily in the US.
At least the message got through. Allez Opi & Omi!!!
not her fault, tho does she have eyes in the back of her head? no. do the bikers have eyes in to look forward and probably have spotted her from meteres away? yes god i hate bikers so fuvking mucj
Lololololololo
Women
En España le inflamos a ostias al imbecil del cartel.
Hahahahaha... heard she got arrested.
Woman moment
Qué estúpida!
When there’s interference with someone’s 15 minutes of fame…
The fan was standing still. He sees her and does nothing to avoid the crash. How stupid can you be, to go towards an obstacle like that? I'm not saying that the fan is not guilty, but the cyclist also didn't do anything to avoid it.
Finally this silly "sport" is interesting lol
Please stop all the cruel comments. OK. She made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. It's only a bike race. Everyone will fully recover. Maybe they should  have been going slower anyway.
From all people who drive cars on the road, we thank you mystery woman. The hero we never thought we needed.
What a stupid woman
Welcome to Earth, third rock from the sun 🎼
Pausing this at 2:02…🤔 someone is definitely gonna make a meme out of this
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is not worth 10yrs in prison thats just messed up as human being
planned scene, actors
planned scene
Cyclists got plenty of time to shout at her..... but no he decides to bang in to her.... typical....50/50 case.
Shes been caught
Selfish or what! Just to get seen on tv.
ได้แต่พิมพ์555แล้วมีน้ำตาซ่อนอยู่
Feminists: the Tour should apologise to the lady for interupting her message.
Hilarious obviously part of the anti menaces in spandex movement
*She straight up clotheslined like a hundred people. I heard Vince McMahon's already offering her a WWE contract.*
The hero we need, but not the one we deserve
Get hunted by many cyclist who got hurt.
Maybe I should stand on the road with my back turned holding a wide sign and expect nothing to happen, when I hear the cyclists are about to pass by. Genius. Absolute genius
just read there is a card board sign with words of opi omil for sale on ebay taking bids.  last I heard the lady holding the sign was doing a southwest airlines commercial about wanting to get away.
I wszyscy wiedzą, że dziadkowie pozdrowieni :)
Secondo me gli sta bene a tutti quanti così imparano a fare le cose con la testa e non con il culo perché la sicurezza negli eventi è la prima cosa che conta
Wondering if Opi and Omi were watching after all.
Phuhuhuhuhuhuhuhahhaha poverini
Seriously, how can you even describe her as a fan, she's not even watching the race she's clearly just there to get on TV.
There goes my hero
That just has to be a trump supporter
Lolz. Legend
Easy to find her she parks outside school everyday with drivers door wide open completely oblivious to the danger
why do they ride so close to the side of the road. you would think this would have have happened before.
Fans need to be fined for disrupting events
She should be forced to marry Lance Armstrong.
A flimsy piece of cardboard knocked the cyclists and caused the crash.
Excommunicado
This is so sad!!
what does her's grandparents think about this news...  I don't know what did  she does that intentionally, or was it an accident. I hope to an accident.
LOL. Now that was worth watching. Other than this what a boring sport. I don’t care for cyclists on the road either. This was sweet to watch
OK, If that rider had a done a rugby fend, a straight arm, bulldozer like........
No joke this is actually so cringe she cost over 11k of carbon fibre bikes and bloody injuries, just move out, stop being so desperate for a few seconds of tv time.
It was a cardboard sign!  How did he even fall? I hope they don't find her. Don't anybody dare turn her in.
Religion has been around long enough now for people to be able to admit to the dangers of it, that it can cause mental illness. So where are the government warning labels on bibles or the no religion to minors hey?? Why is the government not trying to protect people here but yet everything else it wants to dictate things.
On behalf of all road users that have been inconvenienced by cyclists taking up the road so you can't overtake for half your journey.  We commend you 😂✌  For real though peoole trained all year for that what an idiot that woman was.
how tf does a piece of cardboard knock you over on a flat road with no other obstacles, I blame this one on shitty cycling skills
A minute ago i saw this video in tiktok and its in my yt recommendation
Imagine busting your ass training so you can win the race, and then, because of some attention whore, you get basically fucked.
and i heard she's fierce lucky with the odd lottery ticket :PP
Death penalty.
*She is now in custody.*
getting "absolutely thumped" is the most british thing ive ever heard
Whaahaahaaa hilarious.
See the german driver at the right(pov). He is laughing after witnessing some idiots crashed behind him
When I read the title I thought a hipster crashed his Peleton®
Hi everyone who are watching this comment after 15 yearssssss!!!  Has covid gone? What is life like?
Good one lady payback!!! Bike are wake up and stop blame us when we driver pass
She’s the Steve Bartman of pro bicycling.
And the most hated Woman from the riders tour de france is....😂👌
Now she's probably the most hated woman in France since Marie Antoinette
I'll see you in 9 years 2021 was shit !!
Being an adult means that u have to pay for ur actions not running away from it
Ma perché la gente è così deficiente?
I generally don't watch a ton of road cycling so I was pretty surprised how easily the front dude went down - the fan definitely should have paid attention but it also seems like a rider at this level should have seen it coming and been able to hold on...
Australian drivers declare her person of the year
Bruv this pissed me off.   Imagine working and training for years only to have your moment ruined by some dumbass. First man that hit that sign literally got ran over and piled on.
What a proud granddaughter 😂
They really do need to have more barriers that keep the "fans" out....
hope she gets 25 years in prison
Odd that none of the fans by her thought to pull her back.
Humorous until I realized the stupidy of some people....
1:00 --> das German rider in the middle (white T-shirt) is LAUGHING .....
Silly race anyway, always funny when these chain reactions happen…
Her sign reads Black Lifes Matter.
Wanna get away? Yes, yes I do.
Imagine training day n day out just to come crashing down to a sign lady
At 0:32 the bike person tripped bc a Karen put a sign in front of the bike guy then someone went on top of the person luckily she got arrested!!!
I vote for the death penalty ☠️
I found waldo. holding a sign
That cyclist tried to run her over then came at her with a chainsaw, that lady with the sign had a right to defend herself
I’m actually astonished they allow fans that close to the road during such a massive race.  The race was completely compromised because of one person who was in the way
Watching this accident in slo-mo a few times I agree that the lady holding the sign out was a true idiot but watching the actual point of contact I don’t see where the bike rider ever made contact in any way with the idiot holding the sign . It looks as if he rode through a piece of cardboard and that six ounce piece of paper bought that puss down which makes me think not only should you know how to ride a bike but maybe you need to have a minimum weight requirement so a cross wind or possibly a piece of cardboard doesn’t ruin your life .
Poor thing pry didn't mean for that to happen
Can we talk about how a cardboard sign took that many people out?? Cardboard sign = hit by Ray Lewis.
ha,ha, what!? A roided up dude was taken down by a cardboard sign!!! HA!HA! LOOSERS!
Hahahahahahahahaha
One of the most hated humans on earth. Well done.
By the time this whole thing is investigated and settled...., she’ll be the victim. 🙄👍
Good I'm glad they crashed 😂👍
La femme en question a été arrêtée. Elle devrait être sévèrement punie.  Je soupçonnais que la pancarte en carton aurait heurté le coureur et l’a fait tomber.  Normalement, avec du carton, même si la pancarte tombe, le coureur ne tombera pas.   J'ai donc regardé la vidéo plusieurs fois et j’ai constaté que le bras gauche de la femme a fortement touché le bras droit du joueur. C'est la cause de la chute. D'ailleurs, juste avant la chute, la femme tend la pancarte légèrement en avant.   C'est un acte clairement prémédité. De plus, sauf la femme, personnes sur la route ne portait des lunettes de soleil. Cela veut dire que le rayon de soleil n'était pas fort. Dans son cas, elle voulait probablement cacher son visage.
Ahahah
Instead of punishing these people France gives them free ice cream for a year because they're France. That's why these kinds of things will go on forever because it's France and they have no backbone or legal system
Did. . . did anyone else hear that?!   I'm certain that I heard her roar.
The powder keg for the second French revolution has now been sparked. Our children shall read about this in the history books
She looks like the type to get triggered that a man tried to push her around . . .
That's awesome.  One piece of cardboard wiped out the whole entire race.  Hilarious.
大事故じゃん。
Reminds me of Bill Burr’s bit on reasons to hit a woman.  Hahaha!
They found her and arrested her. After the incident, she got on a plane and bailed out. 😂
Richardhead. Female or not, straight up Richardhead.
Why Not Have Barriers??????...
_"Stupid is as stupid does!"_ --- F. Gump
Allez Allez Allez, Opi-Omi Opi-Omi Opi-Omi Allez!
1:55
The sign reads granpa, grandma i'm your stupidest grandauther...
問題の女は逮捕されたそうだが、厳しい処分を下したほうがよい。 私は、ダンボールのプラカードが走行者に当たって選手が倒れるものかと疑った。 通常、ダンボールであれば、プラカードが落ちることがあっても、選手が倒れるということはない。 そこで、何度か動画を視聴した。そうしたら、どうも女の左腕と選手の右腕がぶつかっている。これが転倒の原因だ。  それに、転倒の直前、女はプラカードを若干前に突き出している。計画的犯行だ。 それと、沿道で見物していた人たちの中でサングラスをしている者はいない。彼女だけだ。 つまり、日差しは強くなかった。彼女の場合、顔を隠したかったのだろう。
send that fan/guy who caused this maniac to Nepal. we know how to deal with people like this. namaste from Nepal where Lord Buddha was born and home of the Gurkhas
POOTA do KRL
Oh come on... He fell like a drama queen soccer player crying foul.
Give her an award for services to humanity. Her and her big parasite swatter 😂😂
They ride bikes for a living and they don't have absolute control even hitting a sign?
Now that's some funny shit right there I don't care who you are.
She got caught, and this lady deserves every fine and lawsuit sent her way. How fucking autastic can you be
Hahaha  bloody legend..
Seemed purposeful.., Had a picture being  taken ahead  about 50 yards.. , that was such a obvious bullshit move. Thru away her bright yellow raincoat and dissapeared.
im here so hi people in 10  years
The organisers should be the one responsible for not ensuring cyclist safety
0:48　・・・
I dont mean to make fun but that looked like a Jim Carey movie. Her face looked goofy with that sign up.
Lmao
What a doorknob. Such a stupid thing to have a big fat sign like that.
If anyone has a friend or family member who all of a sudden has a brand new hair-doo and shattered left arm please notify the Authorities promptly.
They should throw some sticks out every few miles. Most entertaining part of the race
We got a new meme template. > Cyclists: Everyone's daily routine in 2020 > Woman: Covid-19
Millions in bicycle technology and athletes, vs piece of cardboard.
What a freakin eejit!
She needs to do actual jail time fuck the fines
This is something straight out of the Simpsons
She's been arrested   https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/spectator-who-caused-tour-de-france-crash-arrested-bfm-tv-2021-06-30/
What a self centered POS I hope she gets a massive fine over this carry on
You can bet that's gonna be one of the most Google searched phrases.
This is literally when Chick Hicks crashed into someone and created more crashes so he could slow down McQueen in Cars
loser screwing up life.
That poor guy who got taken out by her sign. What did it even say?
What an idiot..why are people so dumb just for some fame on TV..people are the worst destruction for this planet
totally selfish, look at her pose and face, completely frozen like a selfie pic she knows will be on seen by tens of thousands... well, now she will be seen by hundreds of millions.
That *¡**h totally did that on purpose standing at the edge of the road leaning in and arm fully extended, by not looking its a good excuse but its very obvious even by what the sign says she is a pos
How many of the cycle started to cry like three year olds? I love that fan!!!!!
They could see her from far away. They should've and could've went around her. Those stupid cyclists think they own the road.
It's fine none of the riders can suffer brain damage
Como esta el de amarillo? Le deben haber pasado 50 bicicletas por encima
Rumor has it she fled the country immediately, and is still being sought after
She may cause a serius injurys to riders. She should be caught and send to jail.
It’s Waldo!!!!! Under the yellow rain coat with the big sign!!!
Funniest thing I've seen lately hahahaha 😂
It’s funny when a millennial walks off a cliff for a selfie.  Not so funny when their moronic, self-absorbed antics injure others.
That woman is a time traveler to stop an accident ahead
She's been arrested😎
She was found… What a disgrace this selfie generation is.
I'm glad I've lived long enough to see this.. that is hilarious 🤣
They got her finally. That airhead is a 30 year old female from France.
its her fault for been near the road but also the events fault for packing so many people in one road. just as buildings, concerts, elevators have max capacity so do roads. thats why cars have a 1 car distance minimum for safety.
I'm not defending this idiot with the sign for a moment, but the more I watch this clip the more it looks like the rider intentionally stuck out his elbow with a view to giving her a bit of a 'clip' on the way through - it seems clear that he actually connected with her body and not just the sign - maybe a bit too much.
At least have a sign with some commercial advertisement for some car insurance like Geico Dammit.
Is the sign OK?
Can you remove the yellow at the bottom of the screen?   It's hard to see everything with it there.
100 años de cárcel!!!!!!
Tiene q responder por todos los daños y perjuicios, pagar por todo el daño q hizo. 60 años de carcel
is she getting all the medical bills?
Who cares?
0:50 At this point she knew she had fucked up!
Hahahaaahaaaa!!!!!!!!!!
Все беды как всегда из за куриц бегающих на трассе
Shame it wasn’t a garrote wire
That's awesome
Debería de existir una norma mínima de MÍNIMO dos metros de distancia DEL BORDE DE LA VÍA HACIA LOS ESPECTADORES
Hilarious. Well done
These idiots forget about the brakes
Commenting to see in how many years will this be recommended again.
She was paid to take them out by the front riders
She could have HELD THE SIGN UP, but NoOoOoOoOoOoO!!!! /KAREN GO BRRRRRRRR/
See you in 8 years when this is on your recommendation:D
The police arrested her today. 07/29/21
Reminds me of Goldeneye! If you know you know.
lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Lesbians in mom jeans.
The human race will make adjustments on this race
Lol
She was a German lady it has been stated and fled the country like the German football team she is going home beaten by the English.sorry i couldnt resist that.
"Spectator Causes Entire Peloton To Crash At Tour de France". Are you a bit thick? Downvoted accordingly.
Dumb but
The irony in this video is on point.
That sign holder...are they a "born loser" type???
Time to get out the Pictchforks and torches! Friends and family of this individual, you know who they are and if you are caught harboring them then you shall face the same punishment of beatings with signs and bicycles
Good news: she was arrested
Lance Armstrong lost a ball for this.
This is why we can't have nice things anymore.
Seems weird the 1st cyclist went down over hitting a piece of flimsy cardboard...hell, I had a dude hit me with a rake and didn't even swerve or stop till I was well away from him.
On the run for holding a sign. Great job
She did it on purpose.  I bet she's a pro lockdown freak that hate normal life!
About time this race gets interesting! Should be able to hurl rocks at em! This sport needs a little more road rash-esk contact!
She better not be a "woke" woman.
Is this really an arrest-able offense though?
Glad the commentator called it for what it is. Stupidity
Terrible
A woman's arm taking down most of the cyclists sums up everything I assumed about male cyclists
when the first man fell, good job on the other one for reacting quickly
She should sue Tony Martin for assault and for criminal damage to her sign.
The lady turned herself in today.  What a crash she's caused!
それでも我先に走ろうとする・・・・
Signs  is a  good  movie  also
Karens being Karens worldwide
Fucking bint
Epo Epo Epo
LMFAO 🤣
Bowled a Strike
She already got arrested guys. 👍
Brawo dla tej pani..GG xD
Hate to spoil the fun but they found her, she turned herself in to French police
😂😂😂
Yeah... a millennial. They are not happy just killing themselves with idiotic stunts, but putting others at risk as well.
She actually took a flight off the country after this she’s on the run lol
The race organizers are to blame here......typically a motorcycle, or two, would be traveling just ahead of the lead riders to help prevent exactly this type of crap. Stop looking to sue some dumb lady and look in the mirror if you're part of TDF leadership.
I hope her cap is ok...
When you see the word idiot in the dictionary that ladies name and picture is right next to it ....
Sign says: "Go Grandma Grandpa I'm a bloody french baguette" 🥖 🤣🤣🤣
This is the best thing to happen to the tour de france because otherwise nobody gives a shit about this stupid ass sport. I think people should be able to throw things at the riders to make it entertaining
Ogni anno e pieno di c0glioni, ogni volta non si fa niente vi sta anche bene
This is one of the greatest events in modern sports history.    She did more for the world of memes in that moment than I’ll do in my whole life.
They found her!!!
And to think I thought soccer players were dramatic....😂
One of the funniest things I've ever seen!
We do a mass amount of trolling.
Who is here from joeybtoonz video?
She became an internationally famous woman. Her fate?
She's on the run 🏃‍♂️  like ENEMY OF THE STATE  👀
Allez-opi.omi!
A fence would have prevented all these.
Praying SANTA CLAUS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
高いメッセージ代だこと
strike!!! bet you can't get better than that. Lady- Hold my beer.
All together guys!! Women 🙄
Right let’s get serious ! The guy who hit her sign … was to blame ! It’s a total joke ! What he can’t avoid a cardboard sign !!!? Haha !! She wasn’t in the way …. He could have Briushed her arm away… he caused the crash … he went down far too easily !! I’m sorry but this is a total sham !!! Spectators get in way every year ,,, the rider was to blame … period !!!
What a mystery! If only they had dozens of high definition camera angles or a few hundred witnesses! Surely this will go down like DB Cooper and Jack the Ripper since it’s clearly the same decade! 🙄
Not even a fan of the sport but glad shes been arrested and hope legal actions is taken. Narcissists of this caliber need to know there are consequences for their actions. Plus shes dressed and looks like a tool!
There is nothing funnier than a bunch of people falling off their bicycles. 🚲
Someone comment on this in 11 years when this is recommended again
She should have done the right thing and handed herself in
Tour de Crash
Got your moment in the spotlight for sure. Hey mom look, I wrecked the tour de France because I'm a total ignorant a hole
what a stupid sport
one idiot vs an entire peloton
...il mondo brulica di gente senza testa......poi ci vanno di mezzo gli altri.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!! 🤣 😂
The rider was not paying attention.  He reacted badly to a piece of cardboard.
She turned herself In
“Oopsie lol I’m such a Gemini”
Death penalty
Que imprudencia de esa persona que vergüenza ojalá la arresten y una gran multa por tonta
What is also horrifying are those bikers that stepped on and rode over those on the ground AFTER they had fallen and it could have been avoided!! You know who you are. 🤬
What the fuck 🤣🤣
Tour de Hospital is now what this is.
When you become a Seinfeld episode. 🤣
I feel sorry for her I mean she didn't mean to! 🥺
I don't think it's neglect at all. She was just as surprised when it happened as everyone else.  Poor judgment, yep. A bit unsafe, a little bit. Is it a crime, no. It was clearly an accident. When I first learned of this, all articles telling us there's a manhunt on. This made people assume that there was an intent to commit the act where there wasn't. It sucks that the news media is as horrid in France as it is everywhere else...
Burra
She has been arrested today..
At least they found this idiot
That guilt must be intense
https://youtu.be/X2npl0Krkqg
Can Southwest use her for one of their "Wanna Get Away" commercials?
Dear bikers. When you see a jackass on the road with a sign like that. Feel free to punch her out.
Her identity should be made public!
She thought it was a game of red rover
She should have been holding a stop sign
😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂
Wanna get away, eat a Snickers
She disappeared. Let the legend begin
Women and sport do not mix....
Not a great week for the French..
man she was not doing what needed to be done but damn. that guy on the bike didnt even attempt to move lmao
She probably said “Oopsie Hehe”
The Irish dancing priest
She ditched after the accident and didn’t help at all. They found her and I hope she get the full fine and some jail time for leaving.
Yeah but more importantly did she post the instagram photo just before the crash?
So instead of doing these races under conditions where a piece of carboard can't ruin the entire thing........  We'll publicly shame some random person instead?  Sounds like typical human behavior these days. Look at the sides of that road, this could literally have been anyone. The guy waving the flag, the people edging up on the side, etc. Sounds like maybe you could change the way you run these races and entirely prevent this, but I guess we'll keep crowding people inches away from people biking along at high speed and act surprised when this happens.
That bit ch used just as much dope as the bikers 🤣
Grandma and Grandpa claims to have no knowledge of this woman😂😂😂😂
Trying to be all in the camera and fucks up the whole race!!! So inconsiderate
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
that money shot is asking to be a meme template
So that's where the Peloton brand name came from.
The whole scene looked like something out of a Monty Python movie🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 !!!!
Sigh.... when I was young, people who wanted the world’s attention used sporting events as an opportunity to remove all if their clothes and streak in front of cameras buck naked for all the world to see. This generation has no courage or imagination.
sleepy joe wants to make  this woman his VP.... to replace the disaster he has now
This looks like Talladega nights ! And Ricky Bobby !  I’m on fire 🔥!  I think the sign reads “ in the morning when I get up  - I piss excellent “ !
ouch, now that's the true meaning of sticking together :O
Girlboss.
😂
Find her!
That was good but not as good as the wild boar man
a woman.... bye guys see you later
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign...... 😁
She seems 40 and something yo, it's quite surprising she managed to survive that long considering how stupid she is.
She’s been found and arrested.
She is found, charged for 1500 euro by the police.
She should be made to pay for all the damage and compensation for injuries,,,
AJ
Im a professional biker. But that carboard is to much. A strong breeze mightve knocked him over. She should be banned but arresting her is a fucking travesty. The biker didn't need to fall idk if you guya have heaed but cardboard isn't that tough. And when it folds like a cheap suitcase and this professional athlete goes flying 5 feet. Idk man looka to me like he should be in soccer not biking
hahaha. the fan brought some fun to a super boring sport
LOL
I’m just adding this comment as a time capsule to get it recommend after a decade when I have a beautiful wife, a cat, a 7 year old kid and a decent size house with backyard and pool.
It wasn’t me
Date una medaglia a quella donna! 🥇
She must have been hired by the Bartsman, Isaac Butterfield..😂🤣
pretty sure $1 million of damages happened that day....I blame the organizer for not putting a barricade and that eeyyydiot woman!
She was arrested
Woman moment
Loooooooool ngl that is impressive but still dumb I laughed tho
What an absolute muppet 🤦🏻‍♂️
the yellow human at 0:33 ?
Thankfully, she’s actually NOT American. Phew!
remove random crits
What was she thinking?  I mean, did she really expect them to swerve out of her way or something?
LMAOOOOOOOO
What a bad driver: lost his balance to a CARDBOARD, that could easily be avoided. Is he not watching where he's going?? And then why do they all drive so close to each other?? No wonder so many go on the ground... Granted the women with her cardboard was stupid as well for sticking her cardboard out like that and then not even watching the pelotton arrive but look the other side as well. Human stupidity at it's best lol!
Its Coming Home!
Practice in Indian road traffic to avoid this in future.
Morron
What a dork arrest and charge  her. Fool
She is chinese agent
The Lady saw an mosquito and wanted to smack it
BUTTERFLY EFFECT !
Woman moment
The best idiot
Update the one holding the sign has now been arrested and is in custody
Darwin award goes too
Now she’s on the run
Imagine holding up a sign to the entire planet about how much of a narcissist you are..
lol they cought her and now shes facing a fine of get that... 1500 Euros :D, which is about 1790 $
I wonder if she used southwest airlines to get out lmaoooo
just like in any sport    they wont stop or move out of the way for u   u will just get owned    track runnrs  will litterly run u over    rally car drivers ops srry        Nba   not my fault u wanted cort side seats   ... this no def  if he would of moved 2 foot to his left he would of caused the crash  ........
That was *hilarious* . Some silly _moo_ with a large sign and a bunch of _biycle riders_ all *crashing*  hee hee :)
this is like going to vatican city and telling people the pop isent holy  wile wateing for the smoke  for a new pope  ....... to quote  pink floyd  " u better RUN"
It seems like she was taking a picture from the other side of the road
bike race is ruined. women most affected.
A legend say that all the bikers have a chunk of the spectator for souvenir 😂😂😂
the road is too narrow
Where in the world is Carmen San Diego ?
He hit her on purpose.
Karen
This is so symbolic of the past 10yrs  To me.  "Someone seeking attention , bringing a bunch of others that worked hard & working together  To a crashing stop.
Yeah she was either stupid or deliberate. Something seems off. Also there are too many racers.
she didnt move, he biked against her....
She is a hero. Good job. Keep it up!
She is being sued
Very bad for the corona distance of minimalize 1,50m from person to person   👀
No doubt the bimbo is one of Dementia "Slo Joe" O'biden's family.  The nut case was holding a sign in French/German that said " Grandpa, change your pampers then take your nap after your noon pudding. Ok?
YouTube doesn't allow me to write what I think about this fan!
Chochos los nonos
Entire? Hmm pretty much? Mmm
Hahahahahahahaha
The Titanic, it was her.
I think id be obliged just to run away with my hands over my face if i did that!!
George floyd Killer: 15 years   Lady ruins bike 🚲 race: 10 years   Happy 2021!
Looks like a scene from tourist taking a picture of marching soldiers who are blocking the way like "make way for the queens guard" videos
"The stupidity of a fan" lmao
rip
Good for her... bikers are always taking up the road.
She is caught, and deserves to be punished for her act of complete bufoonery
Honestly if nobody's crying "get the fuck out of the way" she's only partially to blame. You're waiting allday in this position, it's unlikely but not impossible that you don't look in the right direction once the cyclists arrive.
the organizers do its job from these moments
Hahahahaha
Why do such stupid people exist?
Somehow cycling has got even gayer
日本語字幕の内容がめちゃくちゃです！！
Reality check for her.
Here's your sign...  @ 2:03 sums it up nicely.
I was having a stressful day but this really cheered me up.
They've arrested her! https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/police-find-and-arrest-spectator-who-caused-mass-tour-de-france-crash/
Guarda mamma, come la Coppa Cobram
Don’t see how they can arrest that woman for that. It’s the dudes fault for crashing because he hit a fucking cardboard sign.
She hella trolled the whole event 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best thing ever.
She’s going to get sued big time by the tour cycling teams I heard.
She is a feminist. She wanted to be part of the falls of mens hahhaha
based
Her grandparents must be ashamed of her for causing this huge crash
She has been arrested.   https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57668657
I bet she is Brazilian kkkkk
They found her and she’s been arrested
Lmao bikes don't belong on the road anyways.
I hope she doesn't do the same thing at a traffic light with a "Homeless" sign
Nobody:   Women: LOOK AT ME!
I don't get it. I've been hit by three cars while bike commuting and never gone down. I snapped off a mirror with my forearm when I braced myself and powered my body and bike through the obstacle. I don't understand how her cardboard sign and arm caused him to go down. If it had been me, she may have suffered a broken arm. But I have a large frame, am 6'1" and 190 lbs. These guys seem to be pretty frail, kinda like jokeys.
They are all on steroids
The cyclists in the front…we did not see anything
That poor woman.... the guy wiped out on his own accord, he hit the damn cardboard sign and then fell 100 plus feet afterwards and he caused a huge pile up, not her.....
Wie deppat kann man sein? Zum Glück habens die angschütte schon. Hoff sie bekommt eine ordentliche Strafe.
(Reuters) - The spectator who caused a massive pile-up during the first stage of the Tour de France has been arrested after presenting herself at a police station, a source close to the investigation told Reuters   The spectator, a 30-year-old French woman
Total falta de organização , deveria ter um cardao de isolamento
a piece of cardboard...the amount of destruction it caused....
Why do I have the song "I saw the sign" in my head.
This is shameless how uninjured riders are not stopped after this horrific incident with game spirit and trying to run.
El ciclista le quiso dar un codazo pero no soltó el manubrio e hizo  girar la rueda hacia la derecha en forma violenta.  Bien podia poner la  cabeza protegida con el casco para romper ese fragil cartoncito.  El  choque con el papel era menos fuerte que el choque que tuvo la cabeza  con el concreto.  LECCION;  les aseguro que nunca más ese ciclista va a  intentar dar un codazo sin soltar el manubrio.
If she isn't prosecuted, and I think she should be. She should at least be made to pay compensation for all damage, and injuries, what a gormlouse, selfish, unthinking, individual.. (other than that, she's great)
Why the fuck the guy didn’t avoid her?! Sounds like Tony’s FAULT!
Who's fault is that really? The lady's? *Nope*  Security and Protocol (and the lack there of) are to blame and the ones in charge should be fined for allowing this. (If you need someone to blame...)
Absolutely ridiculous! I'm glad they're suing her for her ignorance! All so she could hold up a sign for her GRANDPARENTS FFS! Just absolutely infuriating!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If one of the riders caused the accident, they wouldn't witch hunt themselves, they'd just put it down to something that happens in cycling.
It looks like the first rider pulled a European soccer dive and fell way too easily. Like he was looking for an excuse to fall
Yellow raincoat lady was a fucking idiot. What a massive Fail for those poor cyclists.
Fucking brilliant!!
No security/officials trying to ensure they can't get too close?!
She should have stuck around. She shouldn't have been that far out. But if this ends up anything like that Cub's fan that "cost the Cubs their chance at world series" then I say let her be. It's not worth a mob attacking her or hunting her down over an accident. It'll end up costing the government way more than its worth if she is found.
Glad they got her and are charging and sueing her,what an idiot.
Its like Mr. Bean scenes on movies
Her face tho
😂😂
Wukke stom wuf eig
That women got arrested. Good riddance
She probably blame the cyclists. She should be banned from spectating sports.....altho if she could come and support england in our next match that would be great....we could do with another defender
Why is no one else calling her an... IDIOT!!!!!
Larry david move
this is a women moment. Like literally she wanted attention, holding a sign for a camera all the way into the road. I hate her already
0:47　決定的瞬間 これは悪質だ。
She was busy getting a photo for her social media.
Haahhahahahhahah
the wheels on the bike go down and down,  down and down,  down and down
God bless her! Cyclists are the most obnoxious nuisance on the roads, put your shitty contraptions away and cut that shit out!
Riders should really be more agile and practice disaster recovery scenarios more often.
I find this hilarious... That women is my hero!
Wanna get away?   Southwest Airlines
Women and sport... Am I right guys hahah
She was caught. Besides a laughable penalty of 1,500€, she faces jail plus over 100 thousand€ of claims from the riders. Even that is not enough as far as I am concerned.
Many many lolz 😂
A woman’s arm and cardboard sign hitting him across the chest made him fall 😂
I’m relieved to hear that she has reportedly been arrested by the police.
Two idiots: the sign holder and the biker who clearly saw the sign, but still rode into it.
She was reportedly arrested!!!
Why isn’t there a barrier anyway
Probably the best thing to ever happen in a bike race
Made it worth watching.
Hope the Tour De France organisation takes the fullest legal action against this idiot “spectator”. Hope none of the riders were injured. Amazing to think that this person wasn’t even looking at the cyclists - stupidity at it’s finest!
Why are the cops looking for her??? She was literally just standing there and the guy on the bike ran into her!! That guy should get charge for a hit and run 😡
Update: The woman has been found and is currently in prison. She's being accused of endangering the public security, and is facing a possible fine of 1500 euros for her actions.
She been caught, and shes a German. The clue is the sign, its  says "Allez Omi Opi" which is half french and german (allez =  french "go" and " omi opi" , german for "grandma grandpa")
She is 愚か者.
Une spectatrice** quand vous êtes fautives il y a plus personne pour foutre les noms au féminin bande de raclure de bidet
When did they allowed blind Cyclists ?
How to be an idiot  Part 1
Surely someone who doesn't like her will recognize who she is on the video and turn her in with full name and address.
Now I think to myself. Why is there not a fence or something to keep expectators from standing too close to the track?
Allez France🤘
thats a european KAREN BTW
What was written on the sign?
Freedom of right, to make everyone crash...Nothing wrong.
looks like a gypsy greenpeace activist or some sort
Big W
Terrible woman,terrible way to make herself famous,she brought so much pain to the riders.Propably the most stupid move i ve seen in my life,it's like she shoots with a gun to a crowd.100% she has nothing to do with the sport,any kind of sport.I hope the  police catches her and put her behind the bars,after paying a large amount of euros to the athletes involved.No time for laughs,hope this never happens again,time to STOP THIS STUPIDITY WITH ALL THIS GUYS SHOWING NO RESPECT TO THESE ATHLETES. Hope the injured get well soon...
Ffs Karen
She looks like she wants a huge slap in the face.
I'll leave this messagge to know if they caught her
idiot men
hahahahahahahahhahaha
What a crash.. came here after reading in the news that she was just caught.
karen
They pay as much attention to their surroundings as they do when they are on the road with cars.
I don't think she is a fan. She is the opposite.
She dipped lol
Has anything happened to the sphincter holding the sign
😂 This is definitely the most exciting moment in French bike race history.  NOBODY CARES
I initially felt really angry at her but the fact that she's left the country like a damn fugitive makes me believe no one on the internet should snitch on her😂
Womens grom USA?
🤣
https://youtu.be/ioi3m1YKhdE 💣💣
Nothing more satisfying than watching a mass pack of entitled lycra lobby idiots crash into each other and graze their knees.
This is nothing.  Wait until people create a new Bowling game on a street full of electric self driving cars, by rolling a beach ball down a busy street. Man,---that is going to be funny, as I drive by and run over the harmless beach ball in an old car that I have control of.
Thats 50/50 feil - old lady with sign and dumbass who not watching where he rides... hate theese bicyclists on the road who think that road belongs to them...
If you pay close attention you can see that the girl holding the sign is in a red and white striped shirt making this like a where's waldo page
Would this gal be scared for her life if the cyclist did not freak out and crash out half the field? She should not be scared for her life anyway.  They let fans so close to the racers, they can be touched, which is their choice.  It was just a racing accident. Leave the gal alone!!!!!!!  She will not make that mistake again!!!!!
Grosse abrutie !!
Cardboard takes these flakes out. Good lord eat some meat.
これは出禁にして良いレベル。 一生償って行くしかない 誰も大怪我して無さそうやけど 何人かのレース奪ったからね
Emblematic of 21st century women in general 😂 Staring desperately at the cameras for attention, no interest in the actual event, no respect for the blood, sweat, and tears that all those men have given to get to the pinnacle, no respect for the history or culture of the race, and bringing everything crashing down around her, then refusing to take any blame.
Perfect material for those Snickers "wanna get away?" commercials!
Ouch she's going too be sued for thousands of euros worth lycra damages.
Hi Will this video be in recommended in the next 10 years?!??!?
She got the airtime alright
Unfknbelievable stupidity
Was in the mountains there about 30 years ago during the Tour ....the same morons are lining the road , they've just gotten a new generation into the game .
https://youtu.be/LX4iqhoqNn8 💣💣
0:47
He took a dive to get sympathy, I have ridden through plenty of cardboard signs no problem, usually doesn't slow me down.
Omg someone literally rode over Tony Martin’s head. I wonder how many got serious injuries from this
The sign says "watch this"
Why did the biker not change his direction? He is guilty.
THEYRE LIKE LITTLE ANTS SCRAMBLING
This is epic!  LMAO
Hey granny did you see my sign?
Catch that lady and 100 lash w/bull whip ....for that ...
Leaving this comment here for when this gets recommended again in 5 years
It's a shit sport anyway
Asshole sign holder taking down drugged out, corrupt “professional” cyclists is about right. Give the woman in yellow a medal.
PE Low TAwn
Remember years ago when a spectator asked a police officer (or the police officer himself) to make a picture of the peloton and a rider crashed into the police officer. It was in Paris.
I'm sorry, I know this is serious and all but I laughed SO fucking hard throughout this whole video. This shit is like the plot of a seinfeld episode. Her fucking grin right before she singlehandedly causes an absolute shitstorm of butthurt. A true agent of chaos
捕まえろよ
Good grief. Attention seekers can really get in the way of progress.
There's something weirdly satisfying about this
French State Police is now looking for that woman to thank her because when there is an emergency cyclist are always in the middle of the road
France: most wanted
Dumb ass bike rider running into a stationary object
It was paper ffs 🤣 what was the rider made of? Tony Martin lost his balance after hitting a paper sign 🤦‍♂️
They’ve located omi and opi but they say they’ve never heard of her…
This woman just destroyed years of preparation for this.
a microcosm of the world, sadly. 1 stupid crashes 99 goodness.
🤣🤣🤣😒😒😒😒😒
Ksos la meuf mdr
It was a matter of time before a bad crash was caused by these irresponsible spectators. We've had near misses, or isolated incidents. It's a bloody wonder it hasn't happened til now. You can guarantee they'll be back at it right after regardless. They never learn
😑😑😒
They should have put a camera man on the fan and followed her around for the whole race
I don't even like cycling and this pisses me off 🤣
https://youtu.be/KCTL3k_yAJI
Pretty disgusting that the riders that made it out didn't stop to help. They're more interested in winning the race I guess.
Typical cyclist... not looking where they are going
Oops im a asperegus....
Welcome back here in over 5 years algorithm or so!  This comment won't be edited.
give these babies a tampon
This is something Peter Griffin would do.
If one rider sue’s her she’s going to jail. The fact there wasn’t intention pales into insignificance went faced the crime of being stupid. Immortality will come at a high price.
haha fuck cyclist :D good work !
But the question is where is that girl???😂
I need a video I want to see what happened to the person that caused this. Talk about brain-dead. I don't know but there should be punishment if for nothing else lack of a brain
Surely that can’t have been cardboard, must have been plywood
Guys, it's Loki
The woman looks like a real simpleton. Like she probably has no husband, no friends, just opi and omi. I mean, who would go to all that trouble to make a sign at the TDF for their grandparents?  A simpleton would.
SJW always causing it lol
This is hilarious. I live in a place where lycra clad muppets clog roads, and are rude about just being overtaken by the cars that pay to be on the road.  So if this woman needs somwhere to crash, I have a sofa, and some spare cardboard!  😂
This being needs to ask itself why it is so dumb..
No idea who that person is but I absolutley hate them with a passion.
Where she is?
This entire moment and this woman being on the run now that she is the subject of an international manhunt can be a South Park episode or a hit comedy movie.
Menudo cagadon que hizo
He could have passed the sign easily by holding on strongly to the bicycle and hiting a fucken Cardboard sign.  He shifted to the left freaking out of a  cardboard sign. Bruh it's not thor's hammer 😂😂
That cardboard was from Costco 😂
Ahahahaha. LOL. Pedestrians have as much rights on a road as the lycra losers.  Hilarious to watch !!!
Looks like that fan was intentionally ignoring the riders while creating an obstacle so it could look like an accident while posing like a statue.
All those poor riders. Absolutely awful!
Fake fan, no kiddin Think she more of a wrestling fan Took out more than half of the field with one CLOTHESLINE (reverse clothesline her finisher of choice) Nd they say wrestling is fake
I salute her
Does anyone know if the lady has been caught?
One fan? Someone who doesn’t know what will happen if a board is pushed on the way of Tour De France entourage becomes a “fan”. If someone shoots them they will become “diehard fans” is it?  Media 0 “Fan” 1
The biker obviously saw the sign he should have slowed down and yelled for her to move , but he want to win win win so he just trying to plow thru and fucks up the whole group. The real question is why the hell are they all riding so close to eachother ??
They need to look for Where’s Waldo’s Wife.
🤣
Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne
Hilarious 😆
She'll be a Halloween costume this year.
How come Nascar don't let fans that close?  How come NHL don't let fans that close? How come NFL don't let fans that close?  How come UFC don't let fans that close? Has the tour de crash continued?
she china
It’s not the cardboards fault it’s the first goofball who got his shit rocked but a flimsy piece of cardboard and caused everyone behind to crash
Something like this happening is the only reason I would entertain watching a vid bout cycling they should thank that woman
The French crime stoppers have € 100,000 rewand for any information on this female terrorist who tried to kill these cyclists
lol it looks like it majored in gender studies
Best part of tour 😂
Wanted dead or almost dead 50k
Reminds me the crowd of people watching and some moron let his dog walk out into the road as they approached and caused a massive crash... stupid people everywhere folks!
Bikers are a against the grain bunch.Hope she gets caught by authorities before she catches a u lock to the dome.
People: How will she get away with this? The woman: To hotfoot it out of here, Smokey!
If I was more cynical I would say this was a set-up to get people talking about the Tour De France(I didnt even know it was happening..England 2 German 0 )
literally a "sign of the times"...
I've never seen a person rile up Europe this badly since Franz Ferdinand.
This is why we wear helmets.
This woman is the equivalent to the brooms in sled competitions.
Make no mistake, it’s a damn bike ride. I hope she and the riders are OK.
Most attention this thing will ever get
Plot twist: One of the teams that had already passed paid her before the race to “spice” things up Also plot twist: She really loves mama and papa
I can't believe people find this a funny thing!  They should this person and give her a fine. I feel bad  for all the bikers who were hurt
Got the Instagram moment.
It's just so stupid. Like now anyone who crashed probably can't win. Not only are they way behind the few who didn't crash, but chances are they're probably injured.
Un po' de fame nel mondo non basta mai
I hope she gets away 😔🙏
She shouldn’t have fled the country like she was wanted for murder.
Yellow lady should serve prison time after this stunt 🖕
👊🏽😂
Dude that banner, I can’t see half the video
Where are all their stupid masks.  They wear them on the peleton don't they as they virtue signal to everyone.
I bet her name is Karen..
That lady should try holding a sign up at the Monte Carlo rally or Le Mans 24hr next
i say life in jail or tie her up and every rider that got hit gets to throw tomatoes at her
Seeing her short hair explains it all
You can't park there mate!!
They shouldn't tailgate.
finally they admitted it. a big pile up. i always wondered about those gay outfits.
She's either American or Romanian nobody else could pull such a disaster
Her actions were  like the average tiktoker's
Look how much havoc this sign caused! We need to ban assault signs right away!
Who would win? 100 world class cyclists or 1 carboard boi
This is a job for Inspector Clouseau.
I'd flee the country if I was her
The guy who hit the lady didn't even swerve to advoid her.  Looks like he didn't even apply his brakes and wasn't looking where he was going.  Last time I checked a bicycle is a wheeled vehicle pedestrian have the right of way.
“I feel bad for the riders, all their years of training wasted.” Should’ve taken some obstacle avoidance courses.
Tailgating
The fans on roadsides have to police one another.  I'd have yanked her back.  Having crashed hard a number of times this is hard to watch.
How can some one dislike this? 🤣🤷‍♂️
Got absolutely fucked. I love European television. They just swear like its nothing
Do we need people like that on this earth?
She really fled the country like she murdered someone🤣🤣
I find this really annoying that spectators think they have to stand right on the edge of road then this sort of dumb shit happens.... if I was on a cycle I’d be throwing fists “get outta the way!!!”       🤜🥴
Let's hope her relatives hand her over to the authorities...
All the hard preparation, the commitment, the hard training, all the time put into it and in the end some idiot drives into your sign, smh.
Who else came from moistcritical?
Please ban her for life.
what do you do when you see someone who is on your path when cycling and you cannot avoid crashing them ...kick them of the road... i think the cyclist who initially hit the board had enough time to kick that lady off ..regardless she is the trigger and should be tried in court so no fan takes this as an excuse to get into the track next time
😂🤣 0:50
get her infield tickets to a NASCAR race...SPLAT!!
This is so funny
Why do they let the fans get that close to the road. They’re blaming the fan? lol
What an absolute idiot. Not many brain cells in that lady...
It would be so ironic if that lady's Grandpa and Grandma turn her in
Idiot
Lo hizo a propósito. Nadie le tomaba ninguna foto.
Karens are in every country  They just come to you in different form
How come no one bothered to stop her right there and then
Why is everyone mad? Finally something interesting happened
We do a little trolling
That fan needs smacked
That lady disappeared immediately lol where the hell is she
Wa wa wa....
Imagine her on her deathbed and she finally confesses that she ruined the Tour De France 2021 with notoriety as a serial killer
Sure it was Greta
Funny how she’s dressing like where’s Waldo and now everyone’s trying to find her
1:57 ‘It was at this moment she realised, she fk’d up
She looks like a Karen too...
That fan’s action was really irresponsible. Crazy.
I blame the race organizers for allowing spectators on the race track, get a grip race organizer your fault not spectators
Take that fan posin for selfie n run him over with all bikes they trained hard for this dumb!!!!
Maybe they get baned from now on
Who else then a woman...
Opi Omi 🤣🤣🤣
Stupid person should be charged with being an idiot!
They are looking for her, the organisers of the tour want to sue her but she has gone of the radar 🤔🤔🤔
Hi Omi!
Je balance c est Audrey pulvar avec des postiches 🤣🤣🤣🤣😄😄😄😄😁😉😉😁😁😆😆😆🤣🤣😃😃😀
That attention seeking person who goes to sporting events and doesn’t pay attention to the athletes or game…just there to be on tv.
Did she take the vaccine?
“Dinoco is all mine”
OMG, But how ignorant is that lady!!!
The internet detectives will hopefully track her down soon.
Absolute girlboss 😎😎
Haha good stuff
What a moron. More interested in being on the TV. Well, she certainly managed that and a whole lot more.
Anyone know if she was arrested?
No chopper was able to follow her?  You can see her as she goes out of frame and looking at what she did.
Tour de dumbass  😛😛😛
People laughing at this …  it’s so sad ! You can’t imagine how hard these guys have to work all year round to get into this competition… they are professionals who love such a hard sport which is not really the best paid but it’s one of the toughest , and then a moron who doesn’t even like cycling gets there with a card only to appear on TV and causes this huge crash. I’m sad at people’s stupidity and cowardice, yes because she is gone and didn’t even want to accepted the responsibility
It’s not like the cyclists can DODGE A-HOLES!!! How was there not someone to move this dumb bag of rocks out of the way.
Damnnnnn 😭😭
Chiclets anybody..? Get on the BMX 😂
OLLEZOPI-OMi!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111
"The Fugitive 2" coming to a theatre near you.....
Anyone know what the sign said ?
bruh theses roadies have no upper strength dude im a mountainbiker and i clip my pedals on roots and my handlebars on trees and it doesn't bring me down but this dude gets taken out by cardboard
Lmfaoooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why don’t the other people just brak instead of full on driving into the people on the ground
She could've hopped a plane and flew to the US. She'd disappear into the abject indifference the US now has for cycling.
She's got one hell of a story for her kids and grandkids
I'm here because Andrew Schultz and the Flagrant 2 podcast 😂😂😂
She’s from the future and she has just saved us from ww3 with this, u can’t change my mind
Insane accident! Jesus Christ, hope she gets away with it. She wanted to send well wishes to her grandparents… All in all its a bicycle race. A moderate fine is ok, but prisontime is nuts!!
She's dressed like Waldo in a raincoat.
Watches Video👀 Conclusion: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Human speed bumps....... DOMINOS MOTHAFUCKAS!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope she gets therapy
Steve bartman of biking.
Lol this makes me happy, all we need now is a snowplow to run all those twats over
Looks like the internet has another manhunt situation. Looks like 4chan will solve this one lmao
Sign of a true idiot !
Hahahaha brilliant 👏 🤣
"Two things are infinite: The Universe and human Stupidity, but I'm not sure about the former" - Albert Einstein
One woman with a cardboard sign took down an entire pack of athletes?! Time to put the p()ssies back on steroids.
Why are the fans allowed on the track anyway?
Funniest thing I've seen in a while 🤣🤣
This is exactly what i'm imagining what would happen when i go in some sort of popular event. Man i feel bad for her and the drivers.
Looks just like the idiots that take to the whole road here near my house 🤣 think they are gods gift to traffic till a spectator gets in the way haha
If you have a bad day. Just remember at least you are not the sole reason that 50 top cyclist athletes who are sponsored by millionaires crashed and ruined their tournament. Now being on the run in order to avoid getting sued to absolut oblivion.
Forget the likely several hundred thousand dollars worth of damages to the bikes, the number of injured people is enough that I would send her to jail for a while for what she did. What she did was no different from driving drunk and hurting people because you didn't think you were doing anything that bad.
Apparently they're going for a 30 year jail term.....about time, its disgusting
Not sure what they can even do to her legally.  In fact if this happened in the USA, some lawyer would have her sue the peloton.
Gabe Hiker
The graphic overlays are too small.
This Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego reboot is insane
Man that's so fucked up, you'd think they'd restart
Now if the woman was a cyclist, and the cyclist was my car, I'd be the one in huge trouble. Anyhow...this is too funny.
What a legend
I hope all of the riders are ok but this was absolutely hilarious. That sign must of been made of steel or something
I can honestly imagine her getting mad at the cyclist for breaking her placard.
This is precisely why you need to social distance yourself!!!!! Even on bicycles 😏🚴🚴🚴🚴🚴🚴🤪
German/ French... hmm must be Swiss, Luxemburg or maybe someone from Strassburgg... hmmm ..
Haha, couldn’t happen to a bigger group of douche bags
0:49 When you want your 15 seconds of fame, then you get it.
She’s literally cyclings enemy number 1 right now. Imagine being on the run and jumping the border for being stupid standing in the middle of the road not looking. I bet she feels a right prick.
Knock me over with a feather
The back of her sign said 'mind the sign'. It's the cyclists fault for not paying attention
From now on, she should attend ralley events: same posture, same attitude, but a sturdier sign (that is physically attached to her torso).
those hippie people which think they are the center of attention. iq like a golden fish
She had 1 foot on the street, the cycler is also responsible and possibly mentality disabled. She is not to blame, if you don't want people on the street pay up and put some barriers. And its a stupid sport anyway.
Holly #stevebartman move !! Wonder if will have to go into Hiding? Oh that only happens in the 🇺🇸
Her sign woulda still been 100% visible and readable to her Opi and Omi if she had held the sign above her head and angled it away from the cyclists, as well as not overstepping the grass patch...
She did what Biden is doing to the United States!!
livened things up a bit though
If she is never found, this will be a legendary mystery, like DB Cooper
come on we all made mistakes one day.
Wipeout...You got to laugh at this though...
I bet Gramps and Granny are so proud 🤣.  What an absolute TOOL, straight off the bottom shelf.
I wonder if she'll make money of her stupidity footages
this was one of the craziest things i have ever seen live on tv, they all crashed again later on in the race
That route needs to be roped off this is ridiculous.
No Tour de France expert here, but I'm surprised the bicyclist didn't just blow through that sign and send the fan in the ditch, not the other way around.
The hunt is on
Zoomers beeing zoomers
Curb music starts playing
I think there is shared blame here.  Certainly that spectator should not have been allowed to be waving a sign in the pathway of the riders.  But if the other riders were not "tail-gating", they would have had time to brake or swerve around the fallen biker.
Thats was a terrible sign
She wasn't a fan. A fan has respect for the athletes. Looking at what she did, she did not have any respect for the athletes. So, she ain't a fan. Crazy!
Send it to prison
How STUPID!!!!!
If the sign holder turns out to be an American white woman, she may get to do her own Tour, of Talk Shows, as a traumatized victim of sign smashing cyclists.
😂
Can't wait for the sequel
i remember doing stupid shit, luckily i didn't stop tour de France
Lol she’s probably knocked her granparents off 😂
Sh deserved the sue sooo well
Hahaha
02:03
You disgusting sinners bycycle people how dare you took the life of a innocent sign he was worth a million lifes NO he was worth a trillion lifes you crash on him without thinking to go slow sinner bycycle people you killed someone so important so precious so fragile the sign Rip the sign may his soul and spirit fly higher then those murderors
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Her grandparents disowned her
So desperate for attention she put several people in hospital. She should be fined at least
How embarrassing.  Imagine being a super fan and then fucking up the thing you love this badly.
Put her on a bike and make her ride 100 miles through the mountains in wind and rain....
That guy fell down hard as a fake soccer penalty
Lmao
good
There is an old Chinese saying for this!!!!!  "Unrucky"
I hope her arm is broken, so maybe she gonna learn something.
How could she have anticipated this?
baka shine
Obnoxious, reckless and actionable.
This is why I think it’s stupid to bunch all these bikers together.. like one mess up and they all get messed up
Nobody: Is she OK?  Me - I think her brain committed a suicide before doing that.
I wish she lived near me.There's loads of idiots on bikes
maybe they should be more spread apart then close together
Bet from here on the spectators will be behind barricades, no signs will be allowed and violators will be summarily executed.
A casa a lavare i piatti devono stare
Are you the stupid woman who did that?  - just imagine being her
I am so glad it wasn’t one of those Trump won signs
This really pisses me off! A life time of training and some douche ruins it! I have done mt bike races and there will be people and kids and dogs on the path, have had to yell at quite a few. EFFIN clueless
Hope she goes to a World Rally Car Championship event next.
Im so confused why people are mad this made it exciting!!!
This was intentional.  The big shoes, the jeans, the striped sweater, round glasses...it's Waldo of "Where's Waldo" fame. This person knew there would be a man hunt.
The person who caused this crash should be charged and fined.
Just a Regular Woman trying to destroy a Sport.
I wish we could see footage of her immediately after - look left, look right, scuttle off into the undergrowth
What a f.... twat 😕
They keep calling her a "fan" but she had no interest in the race whatsoever.  A fan of cameras perhaps.
It was Inspector Clouseau in disguise.
A bicicleta voando lá atrás 😂😂😂😂
that should calm those spandex fucks down a little
Terrible accident, I'm sure the lady will do the right thing. The police have stated what she will be charged with, but probably just a slap on the rist, maybe a fine.
What's did the sign say?
This sport needs more cardboard sign holding women. This is probably the most I've ever watched whatever sport this is... Bike riding, I guess. I hope that ladies arm is okay.
If you look on the NBC Video she is sill there minutes later with the sign under her arm. It wasn't that hard to find Waldo.
The way these idiot spectators continually encroach, the only wonder is how it took so long.
Third wave feminism in a nutshell.
That girl is probably participating in tour de world right now until she goes for tour d prison
All this just so she could be seen on TV or Instagram or wherever. What a knob. I hate the social media world.
Todos se fueron a la perga...
Probably the biggest manhunt after the holocaust
She's a lame version of john wick now loll
Wouldn't it be sportsmanlike for them all to elect to restart the race?   I don't know a lot about the Tour de France so don't shred me for the comment.   Winning is huge but not when 99% of the field got taken out by a moron.
Hell fuckin nah 😂
Despite being able to hear, and feel the massive wave of bicycles charging towards her, she decided to stretch her sign into their path. 1000%, not attracted to her personality.
Every time I f***** up I will remember this woman
Kar-ma for riding in road blocking traffic the rest of the year. Not sure if bikers or football/ soccer player are bigger pansy’s
Stupid ....
Did you notice how confident, and enthusiastic she was, WHILE holding a sign that stretched well into the road filled with a wave of bicycles. SO BRAVE.
Une parfaite imbécile.
prison and fines and you will see how that will change things
How are people allowed that close to the road in the first place? I mean I understand you can’t have a line of tape along the entire thing, but how did no one back her up lmfao
Was it so damn hard for her to stand on the side and raise it over her head? Like surely she must've known her sign was hogging most of the road? Surely she can't be that dumb.
Imagine the years of sacrifices, hardship and dedication to get to this moment only for some stupid selfish moron to wipe that all away because she wanted granny and grandaddy to notice her.  I'd be ashamed if I was her family. What a selfish self-centered human being. 😡
super funny
find her. you know what to do.
I hope they will find her.
She jumped on a plane and left France. Tour de France want's to track her down and sue her... :):
What did the sign say
She deserves jail. Si merita la galera.
Ahh the "selfie" generation strikes again.
Thats some happy Gilmore stuff!!!  Hahahaha JACKK-ASSSSS!!!!
She needs to be charged and imagine the cost to the damages on all them bikes, seeing they cost between $20k to $100k each, they could fully all sue her in court for costing them the race and they would all win because until she stuffed it all up everyone had a chance to win but she took that away from them all, 25 years jail if you ask me
This is quite tremendous. The athletes must've workd all year long and she killd it in just under 1.3 seconds
CAUSED BY A WOMAN! 👏👏👏
1:56 ひろゆかない？
Too bad the fan didn’t take full advantage of the press coverage! Should have advertised a business or charity or something. Woulda been a successful yet very cheap campaign...  Maybe adding fences or barriers along the race course would prevent this!
They're looking for her butt too lol
O:50 bro are you serious
From a normal fan to public enemy number 1. Might be the best thing so far in 2021😂🤣
Wow that EU cardboard must be tough stuff... guy flew right off his bike like he was clothes lined...
Piss me off!
https://youtu.be/BZNB6fV9BQI
that woman is gulty for destroyed hopes, bones and moods. She should pay for this! 10 years arrest at the headquarters for Tour de France catering.
Give me a meme
Has she been caught yet?
Guarantee they all cried after
I find it quite weird that any lunatic can do anything with those bikers, there's not even a stripe or whatever to stop them, even if it was just some symbolic fence. Also I know it's a long race and it would be problematic and expensive.
Ha fatto piu danni lei con un cartellone  che un attentato...
Hahaha love it
Lord have mercy on us, we're surrounded by imbesils on all sides..
Not one person followed her or at least took a picture of her? How disappointing!
The tour should be praising this young woman. Before sign girl, no one even cared about Tour de France She has done more to promote this 'race' than the organization has in the last decade. I wish youtube had a lol button.
This is like trolling irl.
She's a real life Carmen Sandiego now. I hear she's gonna attend the NBA Finals and then onto the Olympics.
If I was Grandpa, I  would write her out of my will.
Truly… the fan is an idiot, but so is the Tour de France for letting fans stand that close to the riders.  It’s ridiculous and horribly unsafe.
Can she really be jailed for this? I mean, it was a stupid move, but isnt this up to the organizer to secure the path for the cyclists?
Tony Martin is 65lbs. Of course he got taken down by a sign lol
Bicycles, ebikes and escooters are great options for last mile, short distance travel. Cities need to do more to encourage people to ride bicycles by providing safe, protected bike lanes and trails. Every adult and child should own a bicycle and ride it regularly.  Bicycles are healthy exercise and fossil fuels free transportation. Electric bicycles are bringing many older adults back to cycling. Ride to work, ride to school or ride for fun. Support bike lanes and trails in your community.
at least they had helmets on
woman power 💪
People should not be allowed to stand that close to watch this race. That lady ruined so much hardwork..
They'd find her quick enough with that much video evidence if that was a murder.  Disappointing that the crowd didn't detain her until the police arrived.
0:32 and 0:50 are kinda interesting points to ponder.
Pas de mot pour décrire son comportement
Women.
Cant wait for the internet to use the “ladies and gentlemen, we got him” meme once they find her
The lady with the sign made a dumb decision, but the fact that she caused *that* much mayhem is a good indicator that the organizers did a monumentally shitty job too.
thanks karen u did it what i always want to do when i see them on the road.
which streaming will acquire the rights to produce her documentary?my guess is HBO
imagine being this selfish and stupid
Leave it up to a woman to F things up
Lock her up throw away the key 🔐
❤️
All it takes is one dummy.........
I'm the world's biggest idiot and even I wouldn't do that!
This woman-New South West commercial: "want to get away for a while."
The crash we all wanted to see. Just like NASCAR at a super speedway.
While the cyling fraternity allow fans to get this close to the cyclists, they must accept the responsibility for these accidents.
France is the China of Europe
Most expensive photo of her life... lol
Prat
They really should have already been tipped off, since "Allez Opi Omi" translates into English as "This Sign is Intended to Cause a Huge Bike Crash"
I heard one person online claim to know who she was, said she was a European citizen living in the US, and is hiding out in Chicago right now. I have no idea if there's any credibility to that, but only tip I've heard. I'm surprised she hasn't been ID'd yet, I'm sure a lot of people who know who she is have seen the videos and pictures. I think she might have been better off just dealing with it there, going on TV and apologizing and admitting how stupid she was. The media and everyone would have mostly probably moved on by now, or at least by the end of the week.
Fled the country , best look at the uk as we are letting anybody through
😂🤣 it’s tragic really but you got to laugh. She must think she’s very important and they would stop for her selfie. At least she got thumped for her total selfishness.
Looks like she went alone, wore a hat and sunglasses, and was ready to flee at the drop of a hat. I don't think she did this on purpose, but maybe she suspected she might get in trouble for standing so close to the race with a huge sign to try to get on TV, and was ready to bolt.
I hope the spectator that took out the Peloton team wasn't a little kid who got sucked under, rolled over and ended up underneath everything.
I don't know why fans are allowed to be so close to riders.  They should be clearly hindered with sufficient distance.  People are so fucking irresponsible and brazen.  She is a real idiot.
Since the Maginot line failed 80 years ago, France has given up on fences.
Apparently, she fled the country.
She should turn herself in and face the consequences. That would be much better than to be in hiding for the rest of her life.
Lol
She probably show the sign to the camera so her grandma and grandpa can see but what a turn of events
Well she wanted attention and she got it.
She is rumored to be heading to Wimbledon where she is preparing her famous pie-in-the face trick in the men’s final. Written on the pie in icing is “omi oomi envoyer de l'argent” which means losers translated “grandma and grandpa send money!”
I guess that's what happens when you and your bike have a combined weight of 50kg and you hit a piece of cardboard at 20-30kmh.
This is funny as hell.
We need to outlaw cardboard signs world wide to stop this cardboard sign violence.
we will have a giant concert to raise money for the victoms , we will call it " BAND-AID"
Damnnnnn
Did you see the one guy that didn't crash oh the smile on his face is priceless 🤣🤣
The rest of the riders: I see no problem here
Hahahaha heerlijk.. 10000000m punten voor die vrouw of man!🤣🤣🤣
Wasn't that WALDO??? 😂😂😂
how does a guy with one testicle beat a hundred guys with two testicles and no one suspects anything
https://youtu.be/rkXxBevb6nc
That's what I call German Efficiency!
great to see the crowds back and spectators getting involved
... wow, no words can describe how entitled this lady was. She'll probably sue the tour de france for assaulting her with the cyclists...
The next giant sign she holds up should be an over sized novelty check for compensation
He got his message across
It was only a matter of time before one of these idiots caused a crash like this. Learn people, learn!
This is not the first incident of this type and it won't be the last. People will be people and neither rules nor laws will ever be able to change that. Lance crashed in the same way and nothing happened that time. Nothing will happen this time either.
She actually left the country like she is some shitty version of John wick
The UK would be putting up metal railings on the course the following yr becuz it's a nanny state
Jail mate 1: 'what are you in for? Murder? Arson? Robbery?'  Stupid fan: 'no I walked into the cycling path on tou de france, just to post for the camera with my signage.'   Jail mate 2: 'that's one stupid way to die'
Mainly it is the fault of the organizers, they shouldn't let the spectators stand to close to the cyclists.. There always be some morons and crazy people around.. SMH
So if it was a child would yall still b sueing jw
Funny thing is you can't see the karen anymore, she must've went on the run on all fours like a screeching creature
Hilarious
Maybe the next tour they’ll ban idiots from spectating.
この女の人、このあとどうなったんだろう。
Sign folded soon as it was struck... Just like the rider...
ROFL.
Hope so goes to jail for more than 10 years for the dreams she destroyed and to make it even worse she fled
Imagine such an idiot on F1 racing😎
66 COMMENTS - NICE
ICE NINE - JIM RICKARDS - ONE DOMINO GOES AND THEY ALL GET FROZEN (BANKS-WALL STREET, ALL THE FAKE MONEY)    THIS IS A PLAY ON WHAT THE DEMONS CONTROL   -GOTS  - GET OUT OF THE SYSTEM
Dang, should of run right into him and used him to cushion your fall.
Girl always right😀
LOL
The guys not hit, looks like I win now
The  words on the sign were a      a ploy to make her look like an innocent fan. In reality she was a political activist  motivated by misandrism   to destroy the male bastion of bike riding ...
What to expect when let fans stand on the road
Good for her! Run girl run, don't let them get you.
Loololl i love it, you go girl😂😂😂
Brutal lol
Who would win  50 athletes in peak condition with sleek bicycles  Or  One lady with a piece of cardboard
That fan should be banned from all sports. What a clown
I belive one day when the time comes mr internet historian will do a video on this
She had headphones on listening to the song "When will I be famous" by Bros........well she is infamous now lol (on a serious note, this has happened before and will again unfortunately with spectators so close)
Fucking hopeless
Victims of the "nice pic for my social media".
I think she is from the western part of Switzerland, language border, german, french, maybe Fribourg, Allez is familiar there and also Omi and Opi 😊
Has somebody found her already and made her paid for all the disaster that she caused ??
Cardboard Karen.
I just came to watch these idiots fall.
did they catch this stupid count?
Froome is still drugging
A woman unaware? NOOOOO. never.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This mare is lucky, that she was not with Slovenian fans 👊
WTF 🤦🏻
And You thought *Women Drivers cause accidents* ?
People out here talking about a manhunt like tf they gonna charge the woman with? It's clearly unintentional and even if she did have intentions it's easily denied and still would be super difficult to charge her with anything.
Intentionally done
Reintroduce whipping and public humiliation just for her
This is the clear evidence that people can survive without a functioning brain.
Sign reads mom my new sign is damaged
Imagine that idiot in the traffic, driving a car
Not normal to let people being so close to the runners !!
Mbappe penalty like that  Libertè, Egalitè, buy a Bidet  🇮🇹 🇮🇹 🇮🇹 🇮🇹 🇮🇹
I can watch people falling of bicycles all day  God that's funny
human dominos
위험해.. 이거 난리 났지
This is what happens when two idiots meet. One idiot holding a sign and the other idiot crashing the bike because of paper.
Signs will be banned in future. Good advertising though
I for one don't want them to find her. I think the proposed fine is too harsh. The jail time being bandied about? Too long. Too long. I like the idea of her popping up decades from now. A wiser woman. A more muted raincoat. Same chunky glasses. Just reminiscing, that's all. Rubbing her left elbow on occasion. Watching the telly. Smiling, as her granddaughter fucks up the 2072 Olympics 100m sprint.
fun fun funny
Foreign elderly
" if i fall everyone fall with me "
we need trump..
There's nothingbetter than100 cyclists running into each other so helplessly! :D
Most boring sport in the world
jail
Mr. Bean strikes again!
Bartman was literally driven out of Chicago back before social media was a thing. Wonder what this women will get
I was gonna be like "how you gonna let a piece of cardboard trip you up" Then I realised its tour de France they just know how to pedal in a straight line
Lol bowling
Not one comment on the fact, that someone could have been killed in this pile up.
you better run.......
What’s the sign say
I've heard she has emigrated to Mars.
Time traveler spotted
seeing cyclist fall makes me so happy:)
Hope that woman gets her arse sued in court.
They say she's still there holding the sign
Give her medal, brilliant work.
The most inappropriate time to say sorry in earths history😂
I think I could give up to the stage for to almost kill an asshole like that idiot. It's incredible that every situation like this is caused by people who don't seem "occasional fans" (like the pushes along the climbs).
Opi and Omi:  Nope, we're not her opi amd omi.  Never seen her before.  You must have us confused with another opi amd omi.
Looks like a typical  childless hysteric german climatic activist with an average IQ from 80. You should search 4 her on friday for future.
How did no one stop her?
LOOOL
A women 🥱
https://youtu.be/x-TSKuqfHSw ...
Dominoes effect
There are a lot more people dangerously close to the road. Why is that?
It was the cyclists fault in my opinion. Not the spectator.
Cyclist Lives Matter
where is dont fuck with cats hackers when we need them ?
And to think Europeans call  us stupid…
That was some strong cardboard!
You can't see a better example of Domino effect than this...
True loser behavior begging for attention..
this is a certified "GG" moment
I wonder how much is the contract put out on her worth?
Please lady turn yourself in
Doctor: are you regular? Me:
She said: I’m going to ruin this man hole carrier
how can you be this stupid, it makes me angry
An Idiot at her finest.😦
They're wearing helmets and spandex.  This is just entertainment.
lol
If this happened in my country, she, if apprehended, will get imprisonment and canning by rattan, 5 strokes at least.
you go girl.  more enjoyment of any non-spandex wearer cannot be found.
How stupid can a human be....what a stupid one....mommy and daddy must be proud...
Wow they let fans stand that close? She’s an idiot but wtf did they expect? Was an accident waiting to happen
Those grandparents raised an idiot
This is going to be the biggest where’s Wally hunt ever now.
hope this bullshit guy has had to pay a big ticket ...
The woman was Switzerland and cyclists were all France... #EM2021
That guy couldn't ride through her arm? It wasn't like she was tryna clothesline him.
I would like so much to see someone with a sign that says “Fuck Opi Omi” 😂  Seriously I hope all the riders are OK, they train for several years and some idiots cause these crashes and ruin their Tour  And I like how calm the journalists stay while watching this huge mess
Y’all are so cruel obviously it was an accident.  People get excited and lose their sense of space it happens. Forgive this poor woman she’s already gone through enough.
I hope they sue her till bankcrupcy!
what did the sign say?
Y la seguridad donde se supone que esta?
Today's plastic POS "bikes" are so unstable, the riders rank amateurs. Cycling today is a f&cking joke.
Let's be honest we only watch the tour for moments like this.
Elle a une tête de neuneu
Stupid! And I heard she ran away from the scene. She was frightened obviously but she just should have stayed there and owned up.
One word: *Women.*
If i was that fan with the sign I'd run and not look back.  That fan will be the one anyone will be looking for now. He's got his 2 minutes of fame.
The racers who escaped: "Good Job Lady! Collect the remaining fees after the finals"
This was probably the only cycling news that got my attention for more than a second
why are spectators allowed so close to the road, hopefully that will change after this!
Look out Nascar, the big one belongs to us now.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol it looked like bunch of ants stuck in water.
This is gold!!!  Beers for the spectator
That *ooo a huge crash* was abit late 😂
how much you wanna bet she's gonna play the victim and sue?
Dumb? Yes. Dangerous? Yes. Inconsiderate? Most certainly. But you know what, before you rush to condemn, ask yourself what if she was your daughter. Would you not want to protect her. I bet she feels pretty scared right now. Remember "a true friend is someone who walks in when the rest of the world walks out" and I reckon she needs one about now.
"Go Grandma-Grandpa go to the hospital"
See ya 2030
I hope they find her and her accomplice…”they” being the 13th RDP…
You know they don't play that shit in france
I hope this sets the example of how bad sideline spectators can be.
Idiot 😂
totally a stupid fan
Cyclists are never in the wrong and should actually look where they are going😋
They all should've given them a good kicking then continue riding 🚴
Rich white folk problems hehe
stop calling her a fan. a fan would probably not do this. call her an idiot.
Mr Bean is that you with the sign ?
So does race still continue or restart?
TO THE SIGN LADY I DONT KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT , BUT WHAT I DO HAVE IS A VERY particular SET OF SKILLS , SKILLS I HAVE AQUIRED OVER I VERY LONG CAREER , SKILLS THAT MAKE ME A NIGHTMARE FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU , IF YOU HAND YOURSELF IN NOW THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT , I WILL NOT LOOK FOR YOU OR PURSUE YOU BUT IF YOU DONT I WILL LOOK FOR YOU I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL MAKE YOU EAT THAT SIGN !!!!!
Another woke leftist narcissist.
Put up barricades, ffs!!!
See you in 6 years after she is caught
sign with the words *“ALLEZ OPI-OMI,”* a mixture of French and German that translates to *“Come on grandpa-grandma!” or  "Go grandpa-grandma."* From sportingnews.com  What does 'allez opi-omi' mean?  The sign is a combination of two languages, French and German. "Allez" means "go" in French, according to Google Translate, while "opi" and "omi" are German terms for "grandpa" and "grandma," according to Dict.cc. So the sign would translate to "Go grandpa-grandma."
the guy should be jailed. this shit instgram culture of 'anything for puBLIcity' has to STOP
How dump she is. 🤦🏼‍♀️
The Asshole of the year goes to........
Everybody gangsta till that lady showed up
Humanity in a Nutshell: one idiot is enough
Really???? Why are they still letting fans get so close to the road... Stupid person has cost a lot of damage and places of the leaders for what? A photo op? Poor form... Start putting barricades up and stopping these things from happening...Or have NO SPECTATORS!!! I would be beyond upset if I was out in front before this crash.....
Spectators have always been the dumbest and most iresponsible hazard to the riders. For years these idiots have been the greatest hindrance and danger. When are the officials going to take action to protect the riders?
This lady just beat dream for how many hunters are on her track.
Lmao 🤣
Looked planned
Have they found  her
Spread out. Need a safety engineer on snails to figure this one out Tony !
1 fuck up, 100 careers fucked.
This type of thing happens all the time when fans are allowed so close to events.
Lmao, that little bastard!
Lol of course
Pero ni yo qué no veo tanto ciclismo.claro que tiene que pagar una multa y la señora y dependiendo la gravedad posible prisión está escrito
It's the organizers fault more than anything. No attempt at control.
The new agony of defeat!
awowkwk
I've seen a grown man dressed as a penguin run away with 1 inch of space from the cyclists and still not cause a crash like this
Stupid is as stupid does. I sincerely hope that this "spectator" is caught and prosecuted.
The organisers are to blame for this for allowing the crowd to get so close. They should be fined or executed on the spot. I think I prefer the latter!
*”A tissue a tissue and we all fall down”*
Heard on the news that she could face up to a year in prison. Smh.
She fled the country fast as hell lol
Can she be held responsible for her actions?
I definitely keep watching this
Leave it up to a woman !!
What punishment? Bread and water with a daily dose of slaps in the face to teach her a lesson 😇
Imagine being that idiot 🤣🤣
Ahhh women
I wish that would happen to the entitled cyclists where I live 🚴‍♀️ 🤕
This shit is too funny
”Oopsie doopsie, im such a scorpio🤪”
Inspired !
That person holding the sign should be in prison for being so stupid
Some people break the rules and manners of society when there is an event
That's why th bikes need blades like chariots
The search for her won't be long. This lady has her face on camera in HD. And I doubt she's gonna be rewarded in her quick getaway. She's gonna be leaving a large breadcrumb trail as she gets picked up by cameras through whatever areas she's travelling to escape. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
I guess this was purposely done by some vested interests to get more coverage of the tour
Let's be honest we all go to the races (cars, horses, bike, etc) hoping to see a big crash and this one got our money's worth.
*I thought peoples were more serious and less stupid but this comment section proves me wrong* *Still stupid ass peoples out there who think this is was Joke*
Sometimes I wonder what these stupid people thinking,  Is she expecting Cyclists to Jump over his Sighn.  And above all of this She Ran away like nothing Happened.   Dumb Girl multiple cameras are capturing you.  🤷
Idiot fan
Only in Trumps America!
Out of curiosity, why did the cyclist try hammer through the sign rather than move out of the way or yell out before he got to it? She was holding the sign for a long time and didn't move whilst the cyclists were coming up. It looks like the cyclist thought I'll teach her for holding a sign by hammering into her hand but then it backfired when he fell over from it.
Another YouTuber trying to gain followers.
That lady needs to be found and banned from every sports event ever
F it, I laughed!😂
No doubt she will claim she's the victim in all this and want men on bicycles banned.
Why do women
We have to forgive each other 😘
You want to be in the media so hard and now... You're everywhere in the media...goodluck
LOL. Should have been some barriers up to keep ppl back.
The fan with the sign should be in prison!
She’s going to get whipped
Bring Lance back softest sport
YesSiRr!! WoW!! Jst wanted to be part of the Comment section!! Lol!! This some kRazy StUff!! FaN's ayy.... Haha! Welcome BACK!! Lol!
Lol!!!
What's sign say?
Imagine if she did that at a Group B rally
Shes a true hero. Cyclists are scum of the road, they all got what they deserved.
Just like an ass these days trying to get a picture for that “look at me look at me “ likes
The stupidity
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Women just being women in sporting events 🤷‍♂️
So strong and independent
She’s famous now!
Thanks YouTube recommended, no I'm pissed off even tho I have no interest in cycling.
So everyone is acting like NO ONE KNOWS THE WJITE WOMAN WHO CAUSED THIS?!  THIS IS TYPICAL
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣....Ray Charles was looking the wrong way....the wrongggg way!!!! Lmaoooooooo
Do they fine or charge these arseholes that do this?
The idiots are growing on fast speed
Although I heard they haven’t caught her, she’s not doing herself any favors wearing a bright, banana yellow sweatshirt. If your a total idiot, you probably shouldn’t dress so loud.
I bet 100% Feminazis will defend her
She should be charged and have to pay for the thousands of dollars damage caused.
This will likely be the most interesting thing to ever happen at any cycling event
I smell Feminists at work written all over this. She obviously did this on purpose.
Idiot
Why are there not barriers up to prevent this from happening?
Democrats smh...
What a stupid woman. They need to find her.
Must be a TikTok "influencer"
Can't wait to see Family Guy spoof this.
What makes me laugh I'm sure he done that on purpose the cardboard flexes he goes q few meters and pulls the front brake 😂😂😂
If you let the fans into the road, what do you expect?
That fan deserves a metal best thing ever 🤣
Women...
This is why you should wear a helmet.
tour de france is way more fun with destruction derby mode.
😂😂😂
This woman's stupidity makes my blood boil. She needs to serve some jail time for this. Plus garnished wages for the rest of her life until she pays off the law suit. Imagine the damage to all those bikes costing 10k-20k each
This is why the Germany used Panzer during the first tour de France
Not a fan, camera stalker is a more appropriate term for this lifeform. Using an event to put attention on itself, oblivious to the world around it.
Will someone please translate what the sign says
This couldn’t have been that bad. 0:02 HOLY CRAP!!!!
😂😂😂 1 for the history 📚
Send her straight to Guantanamo Bay
she got her 15 min of fame
She immediately booked a flight outta the country.
In Venezuela....straight to jail.
Had to be a woman.
If that fan is convicted she faces a year in prison and a $18k fine.
Waldo Causes Crash at Tour de France
Hilarious. Riding a bike  is not a sport.
10000% a lefty feminist
😂😂😂😂
Jeeeesus she is fast... she is faster than the entire peloton  She must be send from the future and did this with a reason to stop a very bad event... she just vanished in thin air with a yellow rain coat  i say i say... this might be a new conspiracy guys ( juuuust saying )   🍀 Luck is definitely on here side 🍀  Life long and prosper,
When the announcer says the fan wasn't paying attention in the road.... Kind of sounds like cyclists when they are in the middle of the road not caring for traffic signals neither
It's not even the fact that she's dumb af. It's the smile, the glasses, she looks like fucking Dr. Strangelove lmao.
Not suprised this  happened. People  are too entitled nowadays i expect the fan thpu6ght they had a right to be there whilst  a race was happening.
Welcome to Millennial intelligence. Barely pond life really.
What's wrong with me ? I find this very drôle ! 🤣
At least it wasn't  a butterfly crossing the road or it would of been a lot  worse.
This woman has made this boring, pointless race interesting. She should get some kind of an award .
Cyclists always causing bother on the roads 🤣
0:21 Special shout out to the woman on the left, in the purple sweater with a black bodywarmer, for just straight up diving into that ditch. I can not stop laughing.
I heard that the French authorities are looking for her.
Where are the  security staff ? Fans being able to get on the race track is crazy and iresponsible organization by the French government.
Oh my. I’ve crashed on my bike one too many times, so I feel such pain from watching all these riders go down.
that idiot should be made to pay for every bike damaged and every medical bill
The only thing that died that day was the majority of the rider's chances of winning
Ok. She was sticking her arm out. However, what grown ass man can't get a bump on the arm and keep going? That should not have made you crash Tony.
Real mr. bean but dressed up like wheres waldo?...
If irresponsible was a person!
Allez Opi Omi... Et voila Omi Opi Gachis...  😂😂😂
La stupidità di certe persone non ha limiti.
This is so funny. All those french men eating dirt lmao. God bless that women for giving us content
Every Tour fans do things that make me wonder whether cycling fans are actually more stupid than fans of any other sport. How mindless do you have to be to hang out over the race course squarely in the way of racers moving at tremendous speed, facing the wrong way and holding a massive, stupid sign?
that's a really stupid and dangerous behavior
This is so cringe 😭😭
A piece of CARDBOARD and the MUPPET fell off his little Bicycle    maybe he should have used STABILIZERS    HAhahahahahahahahahahhahahahhaahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhaha
it's not just the fan. It's the organization to be blamed as well.  So many fans are right there in the Ditch.  Eventually this was bound to happen.  There should've been a barrier or something and organisers keeping people away from it
Terrible and so incredibly ignorant and selfish of this person. I don’t really believe she is a fan. Why would you possibly ruin all the work and hard efforts that these athletes put into this race?!!!
And than, she's getaway 😆
The idiot award of the century goes to.....?
A condom could prevent this.
Drunk and probably some drugged fans without barriers is just asking for trouble
That’s the kind of shit that conspiracy theorists will use to proof we are living now in the end time and apocalypse is coming soon
Thats piss funny
The most exciting thing to ever happen at the Tour de France.
Spectator: look at this tik tok video Cyclist: 😑  spectator: it’s the bugs bunny challenge  Cyclists:👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁
That is why you should always ride Single File...
Going to end up Tour de France having to pay her for hurting her arm and giving her anxiety.
Just beautiful!
Damn she took out everybody lol.
Am I the only who thinks that the first crash biker was rammed by the biker next to him so he has to hit the sign!? Whatch closely!
He should be fined money
she needs to be jailed for 3-10yrs.. clout needs to be made an example esp when its a national sport broadcasted worldwide
This is awesome 🤣😂
R  E  S  P  E  C  T      T  R  A  C  K      L  I  M  I  T
What did the sign say?
Seriously, they should thank that fan, because she single handedly made people give a shit about the Tour de France....
Fact is funnier then fiction, you can’t write this kind of content and it be believable
Pretty cool. They should do it every year.
Whoops .. 😂😂😂
ALLEZ OPI-OMI! Shut the front door! What an absolute idiot!
With this man disasters Tour de France should be an extreme sport at this point
What did it say?
That's the only thing I like about the Tour de France. Absolutely enjoyed the stupidity of the fan. XD
Let’s call it for what it is: What an idiot.
Gee maybe her cardboard sign will get a book deal out of this.  "My life cut short, a story of chaos and turnmoil" by Carl Cardboard.  Yuck...
Mr Beans granddaughter
This stupid woman should pay all the damages and the health cost, or?
Jaja
Fan -  Sign, oblivious to Cyclists in Tour.. kinda unfathomable,  but when your priority is on Camera presence I guess.
Cyclists need to be given the right to stiff arm spectators in the face while riding 20+ miles per hour.  If they're within arms reach, no questions ask.
Hopefully she gets caught and put into prison. Learn a lesson or two.
Bikers take up whole road..  Pedestrian: [takes up a small section] Bikers: my day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable
Nice.
Uno sport più stronzo del ciclismo non c’è!....
Covering a significant portion of the screen for footage that isn't yours to advertise your shite channel is an asshole move.
That was funny it made my night ha ha well done fan
How many people died?  Oh zero?  Its ok then.
Why the stupid yellow at the bottom? Was this to cover up your copyright violation?
Troll of the year award goes to…
That’s funny
Someone translate what that sign says
🤦‍♂️
maximum stupidity
I hope all the bikers injured will be ok
Why??????? is this fan standing so close to the edge.🤦‍♀️
Good
Yeah best tour duh france ever!
Ahh yes the narcissistic entitled white women never fails to amaze
Hilarious thats what those selfish bastards deserve...shutting down half a country for a fucking bike ride
That woman is an idiot!!!!! Why did people let her get away?
Use private roads
This is what you get. On one side athletes competing at the best of their game, training for lifetimes for this. On the other hand someone with no life posing for social media.
00:50 Allezopi•omi!
Now for the real decision. Should she post it on her social media….maybe just Instagram
The cyclist gotta pay attention to where their going.
Nice work! The cyclists around my area are the biggest a holes on the road.
She's still evading the authorities now. Hope they catch her dumbass
The doinklette with the sign definitely got the attention she was looking for.  She sure as hell wasn't interested in the race.
She was clearly an SJW
Come on what did she expect to happend.
Complete epitomization of narcissist social media culture. It had to be about "her" and look at the consequences. Get out of the way lady, it was the day for the cyclists.
Un idiota arruina el juego.
Lmao.... Who won?
"If you bet on human stupidity, you will always win"_Some Random Guy
Good thing this wasn't a motorcycle race!
She getting sued
Wow, I'm famous now.
Karen's in France :P
Karen
Hell yeah !
Zajebał jak Hanka w kartony
She is a legend and absolute hero to cyclists  haters everywhere..I salute you..Thank you whoever you are...I dont hate you
Is there no ropes or barrier? Tape? That would be smart because there are plenty of ppl too close to the riders.
An agent of chaos flees the scene to parts unknown. Now the world is in shambles, with no one aware of what to do.
Bro could've just not fallen down lmao
Take a cab next time 🙂👍
Most hunted person in French history
Greatest thing that ever happened at one of these races. No reason that should have made that rider go down.
I can't stop laughing 😆😆🤣🤣😂😂
Somewhere Lance Armstrong is like yes thank u jesus something new to talk about
She was an lgbt activists
They gonna hunt her down like how the allied powers hunted Hitler
Frances Most Wanted
Bartman
they should have jumped that "fan"
Jajajajajaja. Waaaaajajajajajajajajajs
Im not a fan of Tour de France but racing is racing, motorsport or not and one just doesn't do that and step out in the track... but the sign holder should thank  him/herself  wasn't on a rally track or any motorsport track coulda gone "foreversleep themselves" and should learn from this. so should people attemting for the future lmao even if this is bicycling they can hurt eachothers  (never step foot or anything out on the designated race track) period...
😂😂😂
Do not allow any more spectators along the bike route to prevent this.
I Ride a Huffy Mono-Shock!
Ya fook one goat...
How do you fall from a piece of cardboard? P*ssy.
Karen 2.0
She needs to be in jail
I feel bad for both sides, I doubt that wasn’t even her intent, but some riders had bad injuries. The lady fled to another country lmao.
Poor fan..must feel so bad for what happened.. I feel bad for everyone in this case.. :(
this was easy money
same idiots that stand and cheer horse racing , right on the track
What are the chances it was for a stupid movement
She looks woke👀
Firing sqaud or it's unfair
Here's a GENIUS idea... maybe ROPE OFF pre-planned 'fan sections', BEFORE the ditch, with CAUTION TAPE!  I know, I know, too simple... right??
I heard that she’s potentially facing 1 year in prison. She might get more since she’s on the run.
Hilarious!  Years of training gone to waste because of a cardboard
If she just holds the sign on one side he would have just brushed past it
Women eh? Can’t take ‘em anywhere
Steve Bartman is breathing a sigh of relief.
What a vagine!
The rider should have given her the stiff arm and they'd all might have been ok. She ruined the day before it began
She's probably like, "Did I do that?"
lol stupid woman....which country is she from
Stupidity from the girl,  but that dude fell so hard over a cardboard bro really needs some milk.
typical everyday liberal caused it thats nothin new...
This is  crazy 😂😧🤪
The sue against that woman has started, hope it will hurt her as much as it hurted the biker!
Idiots are mushrooming in today's world. Sue the lights out of them!
Intentional ..
My advice, make the road bigger. I'm not mad at her
White folks learn how to protest 🪧 lol
She was determined to be an idiot. Well done.
Thin line between an enthusiast and an idiot
I wish that was a ‘pride’ sign.
Protect her
WE NEED ANOTHER COVID.
Finally cycling is worth watching again
She just fought with toxic masculinity
Every one saying. On the road keep the distance. Bikers : Fuck that😂
find it destroy its life
Idiocy has a new face, and it's not American for once!
If there was no crash she would probably accuse the guy of assault or 'sexual harrassment'
respect the social distance..
Wait till you see what she has planned for the 24 Hours of LeMans on the Mulsanne Strait!  Woman from the French Resistance trying to take out the German rider...
Any spectators that causes a crash like this should  have 10 years in prison  they could quite easily of got a rider killed
That woman deserves the highest civilian medal. She is a legend. She needs to pop to the winchester to let this all blow over though.
Bellend
She looked like a 'Karen' get Liam Neeson to track her down.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaha
Before this happened I’ve always wondered why fans are allowed that close to pro racers. Not smart by that fan but Unless there’s nothing the organizers can do they have a share of responsibility .
все беды из-за женщин
That cardboard must be made out of iron...  What a douche to fall down because of that 😅
Looks like a Monty Python skit 😂
It's cardboard how soft are these people 🙄
The ‘woman’ has been found and identified as Lance Armstrong...
Cuando no latinoamerica con sus pendejadas
I hope she gets punished
She pretty much sums up what's wrong with humanity... Her family must be PROUD!!!
I really hope they get her and sue her.
Seen an article shes getting sued!
Is she in quarantine now?
Let's go Peloton
So call it what you like but no adequate crowd control there then. Clearly daft but not deliberate.
Can wait until Family Guy makes a cut away skit of this lol.
On a positive note, grandpa and grandma are SO proud of their little girl...
should be arrested for this
Beautiful.
I hope she gets sued into oblivion. Moron ruins the hard work and time these athletes put into this race.
Why didn't the organisers place  barricades ? Clueless people.
Trumps fault......................................
Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
She should be penalized heavily or prisoned for this
That’s a meme for life
Part of the narcissistic social media generation. "LOOK AT MEEEEEEEEE!!!!"
Suck for them but it's fucking hilarious
That was a pretty bad rider to not notice that....
can we also just admit that this is objectively hilarious?
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm not into bike racing , but out of nowhere I got a Google notification saying ' The Fan who caused Tour De France Pile Up has Fled the country ' lmao so I had to check it out .
Her sign reads something along the lines of, “Go Grandma-Grandpa” They must be embarrassed lmao
The race is 3500 kilometres / 2121 miles long. So the one blaming orginizers for not putting up barriers maybe do a 5 seconds google and check why lugging and setting up the 249 kilometres / 155 miles of barriers (which is the longest day stage) might be a bit of a problem.
The fan is definitely in the wrong but when you let fans be that close it is bound to happen.   Most blame should be on the tour for not having a barrier to separate fans from riders.   100% ignorance.
I'm pretty sure this happened because of climate change.
Is it weird that I just can’t stop watching this?
a women's arm caused that? these dudes are weak without their performance enhancing drugs
I would have run too lol
If something can go wrong,
In all honesty the fans should not be allowed so close. That is ridiculous! It reminds me of the old rally races with fans on the side of the road getting hit
Girl ursula ehem
the first time tour de france is actually interesting. thank you madame.
Dude that was great 😂😂😂 she wins the tour de France
Selfie!!!!!!!!! 5 mins later   Excuse me sir.....you're banned for life.
Apparently the fan fled the country and nobody can find them so I hope the sign was worth being the target of an international manhunt
Good for her
She and steve bartman have the same energy LOL
LMAO now days ppl can't even properly attend a bicycle race. How do these ppl wipe their own ass or breath. LMAO
Pijatela, pijatela!!
…i francesi si distinguono sempre…
Does doping cause you to crash into a sign??!
https://youtu.be/A_Vnr1t5f6M
Who would win? Healthy, strong professional cyclist, or.... Flimsy cardboard sign
Wow I would not want to be that spectator right now!😳
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Waiting for @ozzymanreviews
It was her arm what caused the crash
stupid mistake just from seeking attention and fear of missing out to prove ur existence in this world,,
Nice one, love. Wreck the f*cking Tour de France for a photo op.
I don’t blame the woman I blame the event organizers for failure to adequately protect their riders. I feel awful for this fan who has to go into hiding for something that is the Tour de France fault
Poor cyclists have to pay for her attention with several injuries, years of hardwork and crushed dreams of winning the race
Think she might need a lawyer 🤔
Can someone pls tell me what her sign was saying lol
So I have just heard recently that Police are now searching for this woman, and reportedly she has fled the country of france and has travelled over to somewhere else, and when they find her they are going to sue her. just shows how small actions could ruin your whole life.
Must be a liberal. With pink hair.
저 사람 잡혔는지...어떻게 됐는지 아시는 분 댓글 부탁드립니다..!
That cyclists weak how to hell u let that little cardboard paper knock you down
I’ll bet anything she’s a liberal
It's plain simple.  A lot of people are just idiots! And they are surprised that such things happens...
That spectator should go to jail. Absolutely horrendous
They need crash face of this man in yellow
What’s the sign says?
really stupid comments saying how come he couldn't see her...
Edit. Mass crashes in tour de France is nothing new, people get seriously messed up perhaps if they are concerned enough for the health and well being of the sportsmen involved they should find a way to make it safer.  This time it just happened to be a spectator not a cyclist.
Kilimanjaro
"Did I do that?"
i doubt it was intentional but oh my god, what an absolute dummy.
She's in the wrong. HOWEVER, I hope this rider never runs into a bee or butterfly. He pretty much sucks at riding. Just tense /flex up and blow through the weapons grade,single ply cardboard.
This breed of cyclists are not bred for quick thinking, reflexes or to be able to absorb the energy of a cardboard impact, they are bred for checking their pulse and pedaling.   Much like how racing dog is different from a german shepard, the racing dog will be breed only for speed while the german shepard will be pretty much good at everything
Woman moment
Yeah, well done.. "Omi" and "Opi" are now dying from shame.
sad
good for her. i hope they never find her
This is the pinnacle of idiocy.
Sign says Allez opi omil what mean? ........ apart from 'I'm a stupid......
Very satisfying
*Who gives a shit?*
Awesome!
Imagine training for all those years only ride into a puny woman's arms and fall over. Cyclists are proper flimsy creatures like
HAHAHAHAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think cunt is the word everyone is looking for.
Am I the only one wondering why they didn’t just restart the race
What does her sign say ?
https://twitter.com/RoopalBansal3/status/1409096051017928704 a tweet relating to injuries of the competitors. I dont know if this is true but man, If it is this is just disaster
How did he not see her, is he blind? don't his brakes work? Is he on drugs?
Social distancing people!!! Fer fucksake...
time to put the barriers up
The fan didn't do it.  If you watch the other video shots from other reporters, there is no spectator in the road.  You can see the third rider in lose control of his bike and he hears into the others.  This video shows a spectator I front of all of them, but they weren't in a straight line across in the real accident.  It had to be photo shopped.
Suprisingly, she got away on that day 🤦‍♂️  The security officers were so slow. By right, they should act quickly and apprehend her.
A. Einstein said once: the human stupidity, the only thing that has not limits! WHAT A FRIGGING DINGBAT THAT WOMAN...  😳
I don't know how people can watch this crap especially when one man was cheating for over a decade or more I'd feel cheated .
Lance Armstrong rolling in his grave
I don’t know what the sign said ( I don’t speak that language) but it probable said “I stupid and more important than EVERYONE else.  Defiantly NOT a fan!
Stupid woman nobody cares about you or your stupid sign! I hope she gets punished also for leaving the scene after all that happened
That guy needs a medal
Hi I'm the world's most sketchy bike rider and I cannot make it past the cardboard sign
If biker had any power or balance he would have ridden straight through
This is what happens when a toothpick mounts of bicycle and can't push through the flimsy arm of a small girl
Motorist appreciate it. Kill all cyklist muihahaha
Immediate death penalty. No trial. No questions.
He must have been watching Lebron replays before the race. He hit a womans arm and fell down..
This woman sums up everything wrong with humanity.   She’s the person who sticks music on public transport without putting headphones on, she’s the person in the supermarket aisle who takes up the entire space with her trolley etc.  Some people are so fucking stupid that they’re completely oblivious of their own surroundings.
Sign of the times
Very stupid woman you don’t hold massive sings like That. Nire the raiders very Dangerous
The publicity is actually a good thing if you look at from $€£¥  point of view  However if your a fan of the sport this is total a disgrace
😂 lmao
she did the right thing i support her
im suprised the cylist couldnt just stay upright. he saw her and it was only some paper.
I hope French authorities can locater this incredible idiot, and prosecute her to the fullest extent of applicable laws.
i would have ringed lmao
Get her internet! Ruin her life prove to me that humanity is trash yesssss
Thank you to Her for making this event entertaining for the first time since its inception.
Stupidity of a spectator.  Who happened to be a woman with a cardboard sign. She really ruined everything with her useless shenanigans.
Let’s hope she gets the bill for any damages and medical bills
Stupidity on air
The worst part about this, is she FLED THE COUNTRY. She's such a coward, that she can't even face what she's done, so she's run away! And now there's an international manhunt for her like she's John Wick. Hope she gets caught and faces full consequences for her dumbass actions. And maybe the second worse part is people having the *audacity* to blame the bicyclists! They are 10000% the victims in this! I feel sooo bad for those poor men who ate shit, which is to say, a lot of them. I mean, that shit was so bad, I'm pretty sure the men who just barely made it unscathed probably had survivors guilt.
ok
Literal pepega
spandex dominoes, lol
N T C U. Rearrange the letters to obtain the perfect description of that individual.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Clearly sick of cyclists 2 up on a B road 😂
0:51 look at his tire turn towards the woman.  That card board can't throw you down like that.
I hope she will pay for all crashed bikes and cyclists
Stupid Event, stupid Fans. Either you see Doping or selfish Fans seeking for attention. This Sport is getting so ridiculous. Thats sad
Noodle grip on the bike didn't help
Wow, takes a really special person to screw up .. holding a sign.
Please tell me they caught that idiot
https://youtu.be/u2CUK-Rgdoc
Que imbecil
Hahah thats some funny shit
It should read “ Narcissist causes crash “
😖😡
Looks intentional to me
Shame on you.
#GoalsInLife
😂
Find and punish her!!!
Please reveal her identity 🙂
The things inferior people can do to bring down their betters
“I'm ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ” ....🥺😊
Ha ha she's on Tv now ☺️
Let me guess: some lefties bullshit statement written on that sign?
That was awesome 👏 I
😅😅🤭🤭
Well, time to hunt now.
Tour de Hospital
Cyclists: We're suing you lady!  Lady: Adios! *fleds to Germany*
LEAVE HER ALONE !!!!!!!!!!
There's always some worthless c++nt waiting to undo everyone's hard work.
The cyclist (most being dicks) purposely tried to ram her....he wanted to strike her - his actions were intentional.  Yes she shouldn't have been that far into the roadway to possibly interfere (that crap happens ALL the time) and cyclists deal with it multiple times per stage....but to arrest and sue her is stupid.  Crashes happen every day and in every stage -- at least 3 crashes in Stage 3 today with no one but cyclists at fault.
That spectator with the cardboard sign deserves a medal of honor! 🖕 You cyclist and 🖕 you Lance Armstrong
Absolute plonker.
hahahaha
Lmao
Tony Martin should have clotheslined her
It's on tranding 😄😄😄
She ran off like the coward she is.
Sad for ryders,but shame they didn't piled up on her at the end
サンキュータツオさんから
Not all heroes wear capes
Best thing to ever happen in cycling, just hope the innocent bystander who got hit by the dangerous rider is okay
Nie bezpieczne te kartony, najpierw Hanka teraz to 😁
Send her in space with Jeff Bezos!
Hold my loops!!!!
The fans at the races are to the cyclists as cyclists are to drivers on the road....
That idiot must get some kicks! (Mon 28 June 2021 16h59)
Was that everyone in the race or just a group?
I hope the person was found and charged or fined
0:49 Danger !
I’ve never seen that much drug spilled of the floor
Not all heroes wear capes 👍🏻
The sign says "go grandpa go grandma "
I knew I made that sign too big
It brings a whole new meaning to “ON YOUR BIKE”  🚴
Typical France lol
Fool!
Grown man taken out by a tiny woman with a cardboard sign. Tony Martin ....what a giant pussey.
Nazwanie jej idiotką było by homeopatią
I would feel so bad and embarrassed....I can't even.
“entire peloton”?
what an idiot, dont let the people stand that close.  they are not a fan it is an idiot!!!
How can anyone be so painfully low in self-awareness and common sense?
What does the sign say?
As someone who hates cyclists on the road who think they are doing the Tour de France... this is oddly satisfying
"i don't know what happened" I know.
he didn't see the signs lol :)
これはアカンやつや。 自首して欲しい。 ジジやバァバのためにも
Steering to the left wouldve been too high skill for the tour de france guy that crashed first
Sue her
<allez opi-omi> wtf 😂
She was VERY stupid and disrespectful, certainly but I'm not sure that she deserves a full-on manhunt. I'm sure she's learnt her lesson and is feeling guilty and hunted, for me that's enough punishment. Maybe she should just come forward and apologise to the riders.
Lol
I wonder why they didn't smack the attention getter "fan"
Arrest her and sue her. I understand that she ran away after causing this pile up and injuring the riders. Shameful.
Now imagine the anger had it been Trump holding the sign🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
can you even be jailed for stupidity with no intend to cause harm?
Une vraie connasse...
Pretty horrific to watch. That said it always made me feel sick watching the WRC fans standing on banks as cars shot passed sideways at 60mph. Stunned more people didn't die.
Stupidity should have it's consequences. He injured many bikers and they should sue him or something.
Ironic that the sign said "Allez" (French for Go) when it essentially brought everyone to a stop.
How do u let somebody in a bright yellow jacket actually get away, now they can’t find her.
Jail time?
That's not a fan, it's an idiot wanting to get on TV.
Well that's the end of fans lining the bike route.
Years and years of training, dedication, blood sweat an tears, to get ruined by an "old" lady with a cardboard sign to be on TV for half a second. Dumbest shit ive ever seen, i'm surprised this hasn't happened earlier, sad for the riders.
Can't wait until her friends see this and it comes out who she is all because people can't stfu. LOL
Her car has a "Share the Road" bumper sticker.
have the cought the spectator ?
She’s either German or Swiss, opi and omi meaning grandpa and grandma in German. Of course she has fled, but not for long, police cooperation is strong in Europe.
What a joker. Lol
Tour de france is now suing her. 🙌🏾👐🏾👏🏾 Update 2/1:After arresting her they now have withdrawn the lawsuit.
The stupidity is obvious, but what was she posing for. Did she think someone was going to take her picture? Also, did the bicyclist need to fall. He hit a cardboard sign and the arm of a woman, and he couldn't keep his balance.
find it so funny how she fled the country and on the run tho😂😂
It's not a big deal. The tour de france is boring anyways no one watches this garbage
TikTok video creator for sure.
The sign holder is a woman?  I don't see that.
The lady actually escaped the country by plane and now there's an international search operation for her
Look, female. Surprise surprise hey. Same on the roads.
Best thing tour de france could happen. More coverage is impossible.
she should be banned from TDF forever. stupid.
What an a ... Hole. Causing so much pain
Idiots should be banned from these type of events
Her grandpa grandma are extremely disappointed
Too near! Too near! What was that fan doing!! This is so dangerous.
Bang up job by the 'eye in the sky' camera operator. Might have been nice to keep an eye on the person who caused the crash.
Oof, way to ruin your life.
Clearly, spectators are allowed too close to the cyclists.
The organization should be aware that are stupid fans between dozen of people, of course the fan is not the smartest person on earth but they should now better that things like this may happen.
She shouldn't have been allowed dwn there!
0:48
The fact she is on the run possibly having left the country is indicative enough that this was planned, by looking at the camera the whole time she has plausible deniability but anyone with some sensibility knows what she intended to do.
"clearly stepping out", "stupidity of fan"... this mayhem is part of the tour de france experience.  spectators pinch in the roadway as athletes gasp for air mountain-climbing on roadbikes.  individual cycling clubs should sue the tour for an unsafe conditions for both cycling teams & spectators.  Then again, it's partly why we watch... ...how many hits on youtube of this?  You can't have it both ways.
Can’t claim to be a fan if you are more worried about getting yourself on camera than respecting the athletes. Even without the sign itself the persons arms are extended into the road and their lead foot is on the road as well, absolutely shocking behaviour
No spacial awareness, destructive, self-centred behaviour... yep, it's a Karen.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCFUSGiq77jZKMtbveMMa0yw
post her picture on the internet, and point us all to it !
Death penalty?
Hilarious
I actually feel a bit bad for this lady - yes what she did was silly but it was unintentional and you can only imagine how mortified she was. If I had never had a lapse of concentration I could throw stones. That having been said I can't condone her running away and the quicker she hands herself in the easier it will be for her.
This was pure pre-meditated sabotage. Unforgivable.
This person should be banned from getting anywhere near the race in the future. Totally unnecessary due to the hubris & ego of a single idiot.
I forgot that this sport exists... Is so boring.
Does anyone know the spectator so we can buy her a pint 👍
She's WOKE now...
Ridiculous to allow fans that close to riders racing fast down the road. Asinine!
More cowbell
Messed up everything! Now? No fans will be allowed near the road. A barrier must be erected that will be at least 1000 ft. Back  From the tour's road
someone knows who she is....
I love it!!!  Just a bunch of dopes on expensive bicycles
STRIKE!!!
Stupid woman. Where is she now? From now on fans should be banned from watching near the very action.
What the sign say?? I need to know if it was at least worthy
Mais quelle conne
Anyone know what the sign says and what language it's in?

Ce ne vorrebbe una per ogni statale..... Cangiati sport!
Salutava i nonni 😁
stupid sport. should be hold indoors on simulators
The internet should do its thing and find the person. They deserve do be penalized somehow. Like forever banned from any sporting event. Watch from home only ban or something
she will be a disester meme
If 2020 were a person...it’d be that fan
In Thailand also presented this news.
what an actual idiot, how tf do you ruin someone’s years of training like that
“Stupidity of a fan”…true
they will write books about our generations obsession for attention (tiktok, instagram pictures/stories) for everything and every situation. its embarassing I promise you guys can live life & actually enjoy things instead of constantly having to be on camera & broadcast every breath you take online for likes
That's a crime caught on camera.
Se la gonfiano poi piange ...sta ridicola
This person should be arrested, you can really hurt yourself on a bicycle
Imagine trying to send a sweet message to your gran-daddy and some asshole on a bike rides into you.
so a cardboard sign held by a woman that weighs 90lbs soaking wet dropped a cyclist?... reminds me of those sissy soccer players when they over exaggerate an injury...
Yes it was the fan's fault and a big mistake. Now hopefully people understand that it was a mistake and dont start harassing the fan or start giving death threats
Mamamamamma Masterkill
can anyone translate the sign?
Did they find her already?
The fact this was the end of the race for several cyclists is just *infuriating.* All that time, training and effort just for it to wrap like this, ugh!
次は東京で。
Amazing stupidity. She was even smiling whilst posing for the camera. What a dope
At least something interesting happened
I’m not gonna be surprised  if this was on purpose.
Lol, nerds
Bruh she’s literally on the run like she’s on a spy thriller movie
That woman should be locked up for a couple of years... And fined a LOT of money... What a f'king idiot ...
Are you saying an 'athlete' was taken out by a piece of paper?
I wanna slap him for just being that annoying person who’ll do anything for attention or to get on tv
Unbelievable. I'm not even gonna type what I'm thinking.
Hahahahahahahva
Kakker
Bat, Ding....Bat, Ding are you here??    Reply:  Present
Lol yes! I hate cyclist
Shes gonna get beaten up
They should let each cyclist involved in the crash have 5 minutes alone with her.
Thanks Le-Karen.......😕
Shes a national hero o7
Imagine preparing for years, burning yourself out with discipline, literal blood sweat and tears and passion to wake up the day of the tournament with all of your energy and enthusiasm and one stupid motherfucker holding a sign makes all of that worthless in just a second.. memes aside,  I really emphasize with the competitors
I've just found a Japanese shopping site selling t-shirts with the exact words ALLEZ OMI OPI even the exact calligraphy. So afterall It was not even a sweet message to her grandparents but an advertisement of her designed t-shirts?
Unbelievable they can't find this woman?. Nowadays, the police can find everyone, but not this runaway woman who drops athletes en masse. So I would say call in international investigation and send this woman to prison for not reporting the police.
She (?)needs to have a show in Oprah soon!
what does the sign say????
this video is really poorly edited. showing the aftermath before the crash, then not showing the cause of the crash just the cyclist falling, then back to the aftermath, then HALFWAY THROUGH THE VIDEO what were actually here for: the fan hitting the cyclist. SHITTY VIDEO SHITTY EDITING YOU SUCK
Did they restart the race!? That's not fair at all if they didn't!
R.i.p stupid fan
She's probably thinking it's their fault they hit her.
The riders in front are smiling
I just found on a Japanese shopping web t-shirts in various colors with the exact words ALLEZ OMI OPI and calligraphy.
Why is there any rule to have barrier fences next to the tracks for the fans. Would be way more safer
Turn yourself in. You know your actions caused chaos. Take responsibility for your actions!
C’était satisfaisant.
Hilarious. Suppose it was a car drivers faul
How though lol. It was mostly her old lady arm that did the all the stopping which makes me ask how? I hope she broke her stupid elbow
CNN REPORTS...... 100's of news papers will be late this morning due to a white supremist with a Trump sign
Not a fan: a fanny.
That "fan" will be banned for infinite years
She should excuse herself publically and be happy no one died
I've heard of paperwork slowing things down, but this one takes the cake.
Goddam that's hilarious
Andai saja cewe itu punya akal, semua ini tidak akan pernah terjadi
Everyone remember this for the Big Fat Quiz of the Year.

https://youtu.be/9z9iNTjujJA
Omg stupid he do not view the spectator he have the problem, he was break the bike and wait for the photo
Why did I think this was a YouTube creator stunt at first?
And you thought a woman is dangerous when she's behind a steering wheel.
Rub some dirt on it druggies!!
I LOVE IT!!! You don’t see that in MOUNTAIN BIKING! CHEATERS IN TIGHTS!! Hahahaha
https://youtu.be/f-5R3yTfClc
How do we address the woman problem?
Fan = Idiot of the week..., I hope 'Omi and Opi' are proud of her...!
Trust it to be a woman to cause it 😂😋😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ah hahahahaha
What a douche bag hahaha. If you wanna selfie go on the edge of a cliff and let darwin take over.
she  might be lesbian
I get angry so stupid and I dont even care
Nobody likes cyclists. God bless that woman
Sacre bleu!!
J'espère que cette conne prend aujourd'hui, toute l'ampleur des dégâts qu'elle a occasionné. Le choc de la tête du cycliste contre la chaussée me donne froid dans le dos ! J'espère que tous les amoureux de la petite Reine seront plus respectueux pour ses athlètes, même s'ils sont majoritairement dopés.
А что женщину сразу нельзя было задержать?
*Allezopi omi*  Google translate: *antelope mom*
cette grosse folla celle la la
Shes not even riding or driving and is still causing accidents
i see there are Karens in france
Would be fair for hew to pay all medical insurance bills for the sportsmen.
Damn fvck this woman she not thought a minute about what she’s doin
He could have kicked, punches her out the way. Doesn't look like he cared to avoid the crash.
Looks staged to me but what do I know. Whoever that was it looks intentionally. I don't see how someone could do that knowing that it would create a crash.
I hope she has got a very good insurance, otherwise I see her in personal bankrupcy...
Langsung gebukin rame2 dong,masa diem bae ah....
This is the greatest thing ever 🤓😂
I'm laughing my ass off, that face before the crash ffs. At least she gave this sport  a bit of exposure.
See you in 2031 youtube🤞😁
Pahahahahahahaha!
105.3 the beat (The breakfast club ) brought me here, I had to see it to believe it
Ya la llevaron a un tribunal? Para que responda por su irresponsable acción. Sólo así los espectadores van a entender que no pueden hacer estupideces que atenten contra la vida e integridad de los deportistas.
First guy could have gotten his neck run over by the other cyclists :/
She’s not a fan. If she truly was a fan, she wouldn’t have been standing in the road.
Woman deserves a medal
I'm just curious as to what the sign says
*bunch of men having normal fun*  Women: how can we ruin this to get attention?
But if he'd raised his foot and kicked her in the face,to get her out of the way,he'd have been in the wrong.
blokes a legend .. cyclists are always in the way in the uk
Such a god damn boring sport!  It's only when something like this happens it's worth watching.
After they sue her to the poor house she can have a sign saying will work for food.
hilarious
Well she had a sign & wanted some TV time ...I think she going to get plenty.!
If you want to know why we are all walking about with mussels on like animals afraid of getting the flu. then this is the perfect example of how one idiot can bring everything to a standstill.
Lucky peloton at the left tho
Well at least she doesn't have to ask Opi and Omi if they saw her sign
I hate women
Memes are going to be glorious when this story spreads
Mais elle est complètement idiote la femme et ça pancarte,  elle peut pas faire un peu attention
I really hope this isn't a sign of things to come later in the race.
她跑錯地方啦 真要吸引目光去歐洲杯現場才對 那才是目前全球注目的焦點
This reminds me of Emily Davison
That's what happens when you bike so damn close to each other. What are you trying to sniff each other's asses? BACK UP!
😠🤬🤬
*sings* BIKE LAAAANE - you’re in the BIKE LAAAAANE 💀🤣🤣
That women ruined the dream of many men
Opi, Omi, look, I'm a retard :) I'll show it to the whole world on TV. Allez!
Watch 2:03 at 0.5 slow motion speed . You’re welcome!
When a piece of cardboard turned into a brick of wall Tough!!
All that to display a sign that must have taken 2 minutes to make.
Tht sign will sell for a lot
people are being too hard on her, if she was 40cm more left then she would be ok
Make her pay for the bikes
Well grandpa and grandma definitely got the message
GUYS, BLAME PEOPLE WHO DONT MAKE THE GUARD RAILS, DONT BE FOOLED BY HER
This was in France. So there was probably 16 injuries and 2 confirmed deaths
I would go better if they just hand themselves in, they're going to get caught in any case.
Fan on Prosac
See you all again, in like 10 jears when the algorithm recommends this to us
What a useless halfwit...
Ego - Destroyer of World’s and People.
Typical Karen. Has to destroy everything for everyone because they have their opinion that must be heard.
When a fan makes the Tour de France enjoyable.
Vary sad. Extra  Interested person. 🙏🙏
They see me rollin, they haaaaaating
Did it on purpose
Funny, clearly cyclist fault, he wanted to take over on all costs and they want to throw it on fan. 🤦‍♂️
Oh God!  Hope she geht's banned from Tour de France for a lifetime.  Fucking spectators get away from the street and let the cycliysts do their work.
I’m pretty sure a Democrat from the USA caused this unnecessary crash! Hope all is well and that nobody received serious injuries.
The signs were there.  They hit one of them.
I see charges coming her way...I hope she gets in alot of trouble she deserves it.
Will the LGBTQ community name her and bring her to justice?
She must be arrested for this
10 years later we re watch this and will still say that guy a bloody moron
La tête de la meuf 0:49 !!!!!!! 🤣
Ridicolous....ahahahahaha
That bitch! She almost killed that guy!!
Stupid spectator is being sued!
what did they do after this? Did they re start the whole race?
None of those fans should have been so close,isnt it the martials job to control them ?
She already opened GoFundMe. And she is going to make millions. Why? She is the real victim.
That's not a fan that's a Karen!
Good job, lesbian
Lance Armstrong put her up to it.
dirty embarrasing Karens🤢
She is a woman, mostly French
Look at how disgusting society had become where we allow this sort of shit, the other people who didnt stop her are also complicit in this crash. Im not aware of the full extent of the injuries but someone could have had a life altering injury there all because some fkin person wanted a cool instagram pic. These types of people should be banned forever due to their risk to others with disregard for safety.
Someone graces a piece of cardboard. 100 grown men fall to the ground.  Is this the most embarrassing sport to ever exist?
hahahahahahahaha :D
Woman protesting lack of inclusity and diversity at the tour.  Where are the black trans riders?
does someone know how much doping had been wasted because of this crash?
If that message was so important, that it had to cause so much damage, can anybody at least explain what does it mean?
Don't have spectators that close to the road?
**Me finally getting my life together**  COVID-19: 0:50
Who doesn't know people are dumb asses? They should never allow dumb asses to stand on the side of the road because well, people are dumb asses.
Lol
Yes, one fan was excessively stupid. And the pro riders had so little control of their bikes they fell over each other.
If that sign had said "Idiot" maybe the cyclist would have avoided it.
и почему никто не отпинал дуру до ближайшего полицейского участка?
months of steriods only for this
It wouldn't be the same without the massive shit-eating grin, and the annoying clothing.
Hopefully every single person who fell there will sue her individually.
😂😂😂😂
Race officials should look how close to the action they allow spectators. Had there been separation, the crash most likely would not have occurred. Stupid of the fan but nothing intended and certainly not a crime.
German attacks the French again!
Nobody, takes the woman by her arms and take her from the raod, sorry onacaptable this take your responthebillity.🤔😭😤, my englisch is not so wel i hope the anderstand me😏
Stupidity ! Exactly ! That stupid girl has to pay !
Football supporters get a lot of shit but I have lost count of the number of instances of utterly moronic behavior by spectators at cycling races, whether they caused an accident or not.
What a legend!
Too many bicycles too close together, surprised this doesn't happen more often..
they didnt get the woman?  HOW?????
Did someone kicked her ass tho?!
If you're seeing this in 2027 randomly in your recommended... hi
Alright comments section, keep me posted on how this plays out.
I know this spectator is clueless and ignorant but I can't stop laughing at this for some reason😬😁🤣.
Best part of that boring event!
Wow that's the most action I've ever seen in a tour de France at least she made it to where it wasn't boring! 😂🤣
🤣😂🤣😂
Maybe the cyclists shouldn't have been so close to each other.
They are enough juiced to keep racing without their bikes
Behavior is like a American
Poor Tony man he got run over pretty much by everyone on the left side. That spectator needs to be jailed to make an example of her that “No one is above the law” I heard she bolted never to be found yet . What Dumb Ass.
She fled the scene. What a coward.
Regret level: it's over 9000!!!
Typical Cyclists always blaming someone else!
Woman moment🤦‍♀️
I feel bad that I laughed at this
if this not happened the race would end in the same order than the start.
Feel sorry for the grandparents 😐
You have to admit it's funny as fuck. I'm shocked it wasn't a BLM sign .
Commentary on this crash on norwegian television vas pure gold. Commentator 1: What is this boy doing? Commentator 2: I think its a girl Commentator 1: No, im pretty sure thats a guy
Most road users know to keep a 2 second gap. Not pro riders though. lol love this shit.
Mouahahahahahahahaha ! Putain j'adore voir les cyclistes se casser la gueule 🤣
I've never seen anything so satisfying in my whole life
This is not a fan, anyone who would consider such a stupid act gives no regard to the sport and it participants. Surely legal action needs to take place followed by a law suit on behalf of any injuries the riders received 🚴
Allez!!!
4chan needs to track her down
Her head snapping back!!😂 I hope they find her.
Some comments be like “well the cyclist should have text the woman somehow the night before and discussed the most efficient way of holding a sign and not interrupting the race…… :/
She would’ve got punched in the face
Finnaly something worth watching about cyclists!
Where did the guy disappear off to??
there were many things wrong with that  1. The person holding the sign really was in the way 2. the cyclists were way too close to each other (I know it's a proffessional sport but it's still dumb and dangerous to do so)        2.1 this is also the reason why the cyclist couldn't drive round or stop 3. there were no fences to protect the cyclists and the viewers from each other
Well, she wanted to be seen on camera, she got what she wanted i suppose ?
Disgusting from that 'fan'. Could've caused serious injury to riders and fellow spectators
Poor woman, Looks like she's broke her arm 😂
She just peaced out of the event and ran away instead of apologizing. I really hope they find her
😱 O my...😱
Stay safe..use a exercise bike 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"shouldn't have been there" Why don't you have fences up?
The spectator was hit pretty hard. She and her sign did a 360 degree when hit. LOL.
Of course a women would bring it down.
1 year in prison for her! Lets go...
Green hair, obnoxious, and need to be centre of attention do a deadly extent. Yup, that's a unbeaten child alright.
She should hold that sign on Isle of Man or Rally Race. 😂😂😂
LOL !
This is criminal!
"sing sign, everywhere a sign, blocking out the cyclists breaking their spines"
Why would you let spectators this close anyway!!  Jackass sport full of PEDS!!
If you look properly its clearly fr Neil Horan in disguise🤣🤣
La femme fatale
Good on her, those fucking cyclist deserved it.
This makes me sick the spectator needs locking 🔒 up
Stupid fans 😂😂..no brain
Typical angry cyclist, frightened by a piece of cardboard !!!  (2 m apart with masks, just saying).
Stupidity has a face.
the amount of damage she caused by doing that, physically, financially and most importantly the sheer amount of time and effort dedicated just for that event by so many people.. i hope she is held accountable
Wouldn't want it any other way.
0:50 replay
Finally something cool happens in the world of cycling.
This Womans a god damn hero!
When you push to production but missed a bug.
This makes me so angry
That fan is my new hero.
Women.
La mamma degli idioti é sempre incinta!
Catch that stupid woman.
I came here after Charlie made a video about this
I feel bad for the fan tbh, imagine the guilt, you love these people and then totally ruin their race and they all hate you.  Still pretty stupid though.
This is the kinda video that will be recommended to people 10/11 years later
i love it!!!🤣
She didn't hit him with a sign. She clotheslined him.
YESS
Charles Leclerc did the same thing but no penalty in F1 last night.
Quelle abrutie
Karen's gonna do what a Karen's gonna do!
Why didn't the bystanders warn her?
Hahahahahaha
0:17 best view
not a SIGN, more like an ARM holding a sign
“one rider hit a fan” No, a crazy person deliberately holding a sign in front of the riders threw the whole race off on purpose.
The worst thing: she not assume that shit and she probably fled to deutschland, the cop in france lookin for her but nobody finds her.
The selfie culture is depressing.
Well that's 50 quid I owe her!
What did the sign say?
What does the sign say?
Oh did something interesting actually happen?
I’m thinking Guillotine.
Each of these bike prob cost 50k, damage by this woman is huge.
Probably the best thing to come from the Tour De France lmao
Crying from laughing
**BRAVO 👏🏼 I WOULD LIKE TO HIRE HER SERVICES EN ROUTE TO WORK, the shops, anytime I basically travel in my car….she must do exactly this to all cyclists travelling on the same route as me and my car 😂😂😂😂**
There is always that moron with a placard.
Opi & Omi: "I have no idea who this woman is..."
Multikill
Human stupidity everywhere
🤣
Allez. Opi. Omi. 😊 Opi & Omi: 'WTF !!! ??? 😳😳😳
😡😡😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
What a Karen!
Woman moment
That fan has brought more attention to the tour than any of the cyclists. First time ive watched any part of it in years. She is a hero to the sport.
Tbh this has been waiting to happen how many near misses and fan bike crashes have we had. Too many idiots turning up to cycling for a long time. Like the mankini brigade.
If you watch itv highlights you can see her stood almost next to connoisseurs car. At 18.20 after the crash has happened
Bloody cyclists think they own the road! Grrr
Bloody power rangers ! Think they own the bloody country lanes !! Single file please, or your gonna get thwacked with a road sign 😂🤣😃
🤣
Damn cyclists
Time to sue
I love chaos.
Ahhh wait…. Ummmm yes…. A woman…. Say no more 🤪🤔🙄
Fan should be charged for this
What did the sign say
🤣😂🤣
She only ever cared about herself. Wasnt watching the race trying to get 1 second of fame and then when she fucked up and it became 100 years of infamy she fled france...
Disgraceful, stupid and beyond dumb.  I hope they find this person and charge them appropriately.
This woman is a legend
😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣
The pedestrian IS NOT to blame the cyclist intentionally rode into her to cause the pile up because he didn't want to race as he was just recovering from covid ❤
Footage: shows the crash for 8 full seconds. Commentator: OH a Huuuuuge crash!
What happened to the bellend spectator? Should be arrested 😡
Where's Wally Tour de France edition
Madame and monsieur, let me introduce you „Karen of The Year 2021“.
нужно просто дистанцию соблюдать и в намордниках ехать куда полицаи смотрят они ведь всех заряжают))))
I mean... he literally just hit a flimsy bit of cardboard. That was enough to cause this? Does he also play soccer?
If I was her grandparents, I wouldn’t know her no more
What an idiot. She should be jailed for this.
Just came from Charlie's video
Wie bescheuert kann man sein? Nur um ins Fernsehen zu kommen? Omi und Opi sind bestimmt sehr stolz!
Wonderful to watch....many thanks for the fun today..
From what I've read she fled before the Investigators arrived. She's facing a 13,000€ fine and up to a year in prison. Police are actively searching for her. I hope they also ban her from the event for life.
Why do they let fans stand so close? That's a huge security problem. Someone could jump out and kill a rider. Don't they care about the safety of the riders?
Husband is at work grafting his balls off then the phone goes “ honey don’t get mad but  we might be getting sued as I fucked up big time   “😆😆😆😆🤦🏻‍♂️
NGL it’s fucked up but oddly satisfying watching them all crash together.
Jail time!
Anyone read the sign?
Bikers are so stupid they have this coming, good on them, like ' here eat some pavement with your broken teeth'
Fricken great. Now Germany is gonna invade France.
like here for saying fk you to that yellow spectator guy
You don't fuck with the peloton
This is the kinda video that will be recommended to people 10/11 years later
That's why we need Thanos.
Lock her up.
Lululululul
Bring back lock down pls. What a twat.
Why are they calling her a fan? She wasn't even watching the race? Or facing the race! She was just there for the tv cameras to show off her stupid sign. Just call or visit your relatives instead.
Лэwhats going
Social media lunatic
1:56  *Record scratch* *Freeze Frame* "Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up this situation."
I wszystko to przej jedną głupią Babe
I wanna see a Meme of that Stupid Fan
In today's tutorial: How to become enemy number 1 of France.
That stupid must be jail!
is this what they call a chain reaction?
homeless Jesus
Not even a cool sign
You don’t have to be stupid to do this, but it helps.    All to say hi to her grandparents???????
NO SO WOW
Imagine the training these bikers underwent and just to have an injury  because of this negligence.
Les inconnus, encore et toujours  visionnaires !! 😂😅
Please tell me what the sign says? I hope it’s something important like “repent, jesus is coming”
This woman made 3 very big mistakes. 1.  Being the cause of the incident. 2.  Legging it. 3.  Putting dots on the "I"s.  That last one is unforgivable.
It was totally totally her fault but I still feel kinda bad for her
How did she felt about that?
Bruh everyone gotta chill with this lady like these hate comments and press she is getting will def lead to her killing her self. Like the cyclist are fine a little fall so what. She obviously didn't mean any of this and made a mistake and regrets everything just like calm down.
for this specific type of person we have a specific word "μαλάκο", she should be punish by penal code, for bodily harm, fined and banned for ever from Tour de France.
LOL look at me everybody look at me and my big arse sign. She should banned from the tour de france. Now look at that!
If I did that I’d just lie in the pile with the bikers...they won’t know who did it then
I hope she's ok!
This will haunt her forever. Very silly
get her into jail
She fled the scene after causing so much chaos.
She's definitely there just for attention and hype, not the race. I'm 100% sure she's not even a bike fan. If she is, she should've noticed when the group was marching towards her. Just look at her, she doesn't even realized the group was getting near her. All of her eyes are focus on the camera, brilliant move indeed
Don't you just love the french
She was not the only person standing on the road, it’s honestly a miracle this hasn’t happened before. She shouldn’t have been there, but the event clearly is lax about keeping spectators at a distance.
Another Karen..
'Allez Opi-Omi'-Ce sont ses chats qu'elle a laissée seuls dans son appartement?
He should have used his bell
Karma, for all the jumped red lights, and other traffic violations, run down pedestrians on crossings etc.
What makes this even more infuriating is she has a such a punchable face.
she should be fined!!
That poor woman was attacked by those toxic male cyclists
Grab your keyboards and OSINT skills, it's time for a net-hunt!
哪位小姐提出的蠢點子……帶加油看板導致賽道大打結
Stupid people trying to make  trouble just for Fun..
Not even interested in the cycling. It was pure 'Look at me!'   Massive idiot.
Bloody cyclists shouldn't be on the road, stick to a track
Lol she is facing 1 year prison just because of sign 😂😂
nice
I don t like to watch this sport but big support to them. I don t understand how they can do that with people yelling, pushing them, being in front of them until the last second. And i don t talk about all the motorbike and car being all around ...
hahahaha...GOLD
Nagy butaság volt a táblat ki tenni .de ez amugy is élet veszélyes annyi kerékparost egyszere elengedni rá adasul versenybe szerintem nagyon veszélyes
“HEY GRANDMA AND GRANDPA” BOOOOMMMMM
Lock him up, he should think about what he did in Jail.
I wouldn't be surprised if the impact broke her arm.
When fucking up your own life isn't enough of a fuck up for you
The poor girl. I hope her arm is ok. Those cyclists need to pay more attention!
Hhhhhhhh
Hahaha what an idiot. Imagine causing a 40 bike pile up.
The rummage looks like a weekend at the park after covid restrictions been lifted.
You can just imagine the Roid rage from the cyclists after this...😁
A kind suggestion , the fans should be kept away from the cyclists at all stages. First of all the cyclists have a very narrow road and some crazy fans keep them disturbing and that's how the crash occurred, the fans should be kept beyond railing and not give any tension to the cyclists.
If anyone was seriously injured and needed medical attention because of it, she should have to pay for it. As for her "interfering and messing up the race" though, eh, it is what it is. Fans reach over the wall in baseball all the time to try to catch the ball. Fans sit right up next to the court in basketball and get in the way sometimes. If you let people get this close to the event, be prepared for crap to happen.
This aren't cycling fans. I don't know why this people stay by the road while cyclists are passing by. I'm mostly embarrassed by their behaviour and "fans" like that are the major reason I will never see peleton alive.  How many times story like that must repeat itself. This would be sufficient to charge people responsible for crashes as ones that are responsible for road accidents.
Seriously though, could that rider have not just powered through that without coming off his bike like a 12 year old?
She prolly is a tiktoker
"crash? so what? its not important..the most important thing is i've got the best pic to upload in instagram"
Is she being sued by the organizers of the race?😐
I can't believe the police can't catch one woman in yellow, what if she's a terrorist?😂
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
That’s some strong cardboard
Woman Moment
she on the run 😳
Idiot with sign needs jail time.
Unpopular opinion: i don't think the woman should have extreme punishments like jail time or get sued by millions i think thats too far it was clearly an accident but she deserves punishment of some sort.
Just like slapping macrel
It seems like she did it purposely! Smiling away
LOL
🤣
who's here because of tiktok?
Remove the spec takers from the side of the road
Hung, drawn and quartered.
Judging by her appearance, she is a lesbian. I didn't expect anything else from Europe. A greeting from homophobic Russia.
This women owes it to every cyclist she caused to get injuried here to turn herself in. You don't get to just pick up and run when your actions cause so many people to be injured and have their dreams crushed.
This is so funny they deserve this
mon dieu que certain peuvent être idiot !!!!!
Apparently the French have their own brand of stupid too. Her inspiration: Jerry Lewis...

Lmao, nothing is better than seeing those pain in the arse cyclists come crashing down, men in  Lycra make my journey to and from work a nightmare every day so seeing this is awesome
More of this please. I hate this sport anyway. Maybe we see some other hero's doing more blokking. She is a hero and derserve the highest medal of honor. I bow for her.
She’s fled the country as soon as this happened and now they’re hunting her down to sue lmao
time to get a new identity
In a way, I can't blame her for fleeing the scene because I can't even imagine the amount of guilt and shame I'd feel if I fucked up this badly. I'd never be able to show my face in public again ever.
Spectators who pull crap like that should be held liable for damages, fined and banned from all future sporting events.
#SavePalestine #SaveSheikhJarrah #SaveSilwan
she clearly did it on purpose.
What a idiot,, stick your stupid sign in the riders way and turn your back on them, what next, a banner across the road.
That woman is a complete idiot
관심종자
obviously she was not there to watch TDF  and now TDF is going to make her pay for  her stupidity, man some people
Andate in pista a correre e non per le strade a rompere le palle.
Can someone give her a good slap? Video it and post in you tube?
they shouldnt even be allowed to be that close. should be a gate or yellow tape
Real Life Mrs Bean
I bet she feels stupid now
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The woman's new objective is now "Survive"
Oh boy it does suck to be an idiot making an unintentional mistake and have the whole world hate you. Good luck to her.
Women...
She did that on purpose.  That was no accident trust me. She was trying to pretend she wasn't paying attention. But that was a planned sabotage
thats asshole needs to make a public apology
how stupid. lol
How people with no common sense get by in life is beyond me lol
A great Seinfeld episode.
So are we gonna ignore the dude that got ran over multiple times?
ALLEZ OPI OMI !!!!
they probably should hire a contract killer on this lady's head after this lmao
2:03 oh my god that poor biker literally had the cycle run over him. Yikes.
Sadly, the rider did not hit her full force, instead of being injured severely alone... This fan woud so deserve a few weeks ICU...
Karen
i googled who was the idiot who caused this major crash. but apparently the police are still looking to identify her
Fucking fan
コース脇でレースも見ずに、いったい何がしたかったのかと・・・・。
Bad things happen to grown men wearing colourful Lycra.
If they can't endure a safe race course for all. This event should be banned from public areas and held on private property
What an absolute idiot. She’s certainly gonna get her fame now.
https://youtu.be/hH5hewqCSEQ
Sign was sticking out at a angle but was not malicious and going to be sued.
Woman Moment
She left the country on the run yes🤣💀
They're gonna make an example outta this idiot. They're gonna sue and ban her to make sure no one ever does this again. The Tour de France has the WORST spectators out of any sporting event in the entire world. Something has to change.
That fan is a stupid human. Even a dog would be aware of a safe distance of spacing.
Some people in the comments are just choosing to be stupid.
When Waldo decided to show himself
I hate her.
Look at how fucking bunched up they are at the beginning. Shit like this was bound to happen. They’re packed like sardines. If one person goes down, all of them are.
did she get caught?  smh
It's horrible what she did
selfie.....
Did she escape????? She should be arrested
Someone knows who she is. I hope they turn her in!
She bounced lmao
How many idiots want to be caught on camera
Hi people years in the future that got this in your recommended
I see some major changes coming up in the next Tour de France.
A fan… sure….
I can't understand how they don't have barriers for the spectators? And that there is absolutely no distance between the actual road and the spectators gathered around...  I absolutely don't support this fan and their stupid reckless behavior
The international manhunt for this lady is probably the most intriguing part of the whole story.
Squading TYPICAL
in democratic France, that spectator shouldn't be punished, let us all celebrate rainbows and butterflies.
Meh, screw cyclists lol
What are the odds on this game? THIS WAS SET UP! Whatever you believe happened, this wasn't an accident. Whatever she's charged with, can be handled.
But what did the sign say?!.... (in English)
It's like these idiots think they're the main character in this world.
Poor lady. The coming repercussions far exceed her error.
Why didn't they catch her on the spot?
The rider tried to avoid the person with the sign - he should have raised his elbow, leaned into it, and taken the s*$&head out!
I heard her last name was Bartman
the ME ME ME society of today
Why they let people so close to the road in the first place. This is hilarious. 😂
This is a great example how a few can ruin for many.
That women’s ignorance is mind boggling … Why doesn’t the Tour Staff which must be quite large have a spotter and some muscle in the high spectator areas???  Why don’t they use blow horns and educate the spectators to be behind the line???   Sounds like somebody dropped the ball there …
Ffs…
Someone paid her to do it
When you are dumb enough to do that
Dico io....ma si può fare autostop durante il tour de France???
and then she was never seen again
In the future, everybody will be famous for 15 minutes. Andy Warhol Smile b**ch, you're famous now!
It's necessary an interview of her
What happened to the her afterward? Does she got caught by the police or any news regaarding her?
someone needs an ass whooping
France finally has a superhero
What did the sign say?????
Why don’t they have fences or some security so idiots don’t do this.
Anddd just like that how i met ur mom 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The yellow raincoat madman(woman) in this video will be remembered forever unless the tour de xxxx game disappears.
All for attention
There was a cyclist yesterday riding in the car lane holding up cars movement when he had a nice bicycle lane. So I don't care anymore about these wipe outs. I need to see some 18 speeds go riderless into a ditch.
"we surrender"
What does the sign say?
Most exciting cycling event yet
She made history, she just doesn’t know it
First i thought its Greenpeace again
grandpa and grandma must be proud
I'm trying to say here not laugh about it because my weird sense of humor and I hope everyone's okay but damn you got to admit that's freaking funny
There are only two choices left: ban spectators or have lead trucks with scoops forcibly push the road hazard pedestrians aside.  It is a seemingly insane idea, but for many riders, this is their one shot in a great but challenging sport.  A real great veteran rider like Tony Martin did not deserve this.  The fans used to cheer the riders.  Now they cheer for themselves.
has she been identified? Any consequences possible? (though I imagine there’s nothing really that can be done)
this lady is a walking definition of a karen, probably thinks to herself it's their fault for not moving out of her way.
The spectator clearly going after her Instagram post.
Strike!!!
Faut retrouver cette femme
stupid act!! sue her!
poor woman .. now she has to fear a lawsuit  👀😔  😬😄 🤷🏽‍♂️
バカ丸出しの表情❗
ONE STRONG PIECE OF CARDBOARD  ONE LEAP FOR MANKIND 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well...you won't see this in an LTN
moistcritical sent me lmfaoooo, SHE FLED THE COUNTRY LASKAKSDAMASNMIJ
bet she is a man hating feminist
She's a coward for fleeing. Face the music
He got taken out by cardboard how could the biker not see what's infront of hiim? LMFAO!!!
AHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
Grandma and grandpa, be not proud...
Keep her away from NASCAR
I’m talking to the future people who get this in they’re recommended years later hi
I realize it was an accident, but that doesn’t mean the spectator isn’t responsible. I think the organizers should seek damages because this was entirely avoidable.
The one holding the sign should be accountable for causing this !!!
Real life comedy gold right here, doesn’t get any better than that. 🤣
I'm ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳⁱᵇⁱⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳⁱᵇᵉ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡⁱᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰⁱˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ"'
It’s always one stupid person messes up everything. She need to be charged & fined by law for not obeying order & causing so much damage.
15 minutes of fame - WORSE NOW THEN EVER! SMH! 🤦🏾‍♂️
bruh.
Crucified for life
boomers i tell you
Goals
This is like a real life cartoon
That’s messed up...they need to deal with that person who caused this pile up with the quickness and severely.
Tradition caused that crash.
The tour de France wants to sue her
It was a wooden sign not a cardboard sign 😡
https://youtu.be/McvKR-UsQJA
And the idiot award of the year goes to:
There's a reason the World Rally Championship banned fans from standing beside the road like they used to do.  NO ONE should have been standing roadside when there was a stable and elevated berm a metre away from it.
Was hoping for 15 seconds of fame, now infamous for life. Good job woketard.
Taken out by a cardboard sign, lol!
They really said that they liked domino’s
New meme?
Irritating people, ugh.
What a wacky turn of events. If I were her I’d get the hell out of there immediately. Lol
https://youtu.be/En0jKkitpEc
I think it was Rachel Maddow in a yellow slicker..
sometimes i feel like that spectator who fucked up
HELLO PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE !!!
she did it for the clout, duh the shot was good for that 1 second, but the aftermath . i have a photo saved now 0:48
0:47   I say it's totally HIS fault.   Yup has this guy ever ridden a bike before, yes he has.   He should have slammed into her leaning to his right,  then pushed into the grass to his right then get up and re-enter the race without ruining the entire group.  What a wimp.   instead he acts like something like this has never been seen before.   Sure she did something stupid , but he did something more stupid in fact i wouldn't be surprised is this was planned.
Why do women care about attention so much? It’s pathetic and child-like.
Just one narcissist can wreak havoc on tens of people.
This is a new level of Karen.
Sign reads "Biden Voter".
She should be sued.
Poor riders, I hope someone clocked her for doing that geez what a ass
Omg I would personally apologize to each rider if that was me
This woman has become the meme of meme's. Imagine being France's most wanted tourist....🤣
Oh man, if she's got no money, the french are gonna give her the ol king Louis treatment.
Lol what a clown she is
For me i would punch the fan who made the huge crash
This is hilarious.
I’ll see you guys again in 10 years .
Imagine how angry the riders were. It would have taken everything to stop some of them from tearing the self centred prick limb from limb.
hope she gets caught and gets the worst of everything sanctions she can get thrown at her.
0:47 there it is
0:48 Grandpa and grandma wouldn't want this.
Cr1tikal led me here
Well her life is ruined…over a fucking sign
That lady’s life just became the final mission of Halo Reach
Narcissist to an Extreme Degree of Obliviousness...
First bike race I’ve ever watched...was not disappointed
Oh, she caused a huge crash because of her stupidity and didn't stay behind to face the music? So stupid and a coward?
*ALLEZ OPi-OMi !*
Jajaj so nice
Looks like a complete dumba-- just not knowing whats going on. From what I saw, IMHO. Next year we need to keep a police line tape keeping everyone away from the road. One person ruined it for everyone.
Incoming angry butthole cyclists with opinions xD
Im not defending the person with the sign  But why the FUCK are people allowed to be so close to the race???? Im surprised this doesnt happen more often. Maybe keep spectators away from the race track????
I hope she's not Karen....
Good thing she’s being sued, I hope they find her
imprison that stupid audience 😃
0:49 WE FOUND WALDO!
Anyone know what her sign says?  Maybe dumb ass?
who would think a piece of cardboard would crash the entire field.   This makes me want to watch for the first time ever!  Will this happen every day?  Oh.  Wait...  hahahaha
This is the kinda video that will be recommended to people 10/11 years later
Women in yellow  clothes cause it
That lady is probably the kind of attention seeking women who's a feminist or karen
you can see the guy get hit by her arm at 0:52 .
she's not even driving smh
On purpose? She can't be pushed aside, she knew the shock was coming. Take of the hat, the glasses, the yellow jacket and she won't be found. This looks suspicious. And the cameraman was in place. Check the cameraman...!
こういう動画が長い年月を経ておすすめで出てくるのか
DAMNN.....It's like from a comedy movie....
Here before this gets recommended to everyone 10 years later.
this is why u need corona
She should be placed randomly on every stage as an obstacle, much more entertaining
Tool! Just a plain tool!
This is amazing.
Where's the road organisors..??!
We live in a society where a few seconds of acknowledgment is more important than other human wellbeing.
Did they beat up the troublemaker?
T.W.A.T.
People saying the first guy who fell down should have braked, even if he did brake there is still a lot of other bikers behind him do you think they will all have the same reaction speed to stop or see what is ahead? Even if he somehow dodged it in a split second the next biker after him would not have time to react and so fourth. There's a reason there was a pile up and that was because of the foolish spectator wanted her 5 seconds of fame.
Thank goodness for his helmet.
Hahhahahahahahahahahhahaha cyclists. Scum of the world
She definitely looks like a liberal.
Yeah she was endangering others
i love how they say the stupidity of a fan   that's thic jokes
The organizers are suing the spectator. The reason they told the media is "We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this don't spoil the show for everyone".   Good luck looking for this bit*h. She fled immediately from the scene after seeing what she did. A hit and run
So much respect for the guy
Wait till they find her and make a movie about how she ruined her life
She is hiding! She thinks she can just get away scot free!
Things people do for the gram.
La connasse...
If I was her I would go live in a bunker somewhere because she is about to get a whole lot of hell
Wow and she didn't come forward and apologize.
To that spectator, next time try that in wrc stage
Rip that women future. A life of trolling is a head of her.
Wow! Slow speed, small cardboard sign - and yet many riders could have gotten debilitating injuries. Broken kneecaps, twisted and ripped ankle tendons, wrenched spines. Close crowds and a roadside ditch, no 'ounce of prevention' for this bad mishap.
There should be charged , personal injury !!!
What was written on the sign?
I didn't know the tour de France could be this interesting!
COVID 19 IS AN AGENDA. ALL KNOWN.......ALL PLANNED... FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RESET. WARNING. FAKE NEWS WILL BRING A VARIANT THAT IS MUCH WORSE THEN COVID 19 IS COMING GLOBALLY. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING WHAT IS TO COME. THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART..
I would not call "a fan" a person looking away from the riders.
Hope she's able to get through this OK. Yes it was a stupid move but hey, everyone makes mistakes!
stupid fan, stupid pseudo sport :D
Dunce of the Decade.
To be fair, it also looks like that idiot racer slammed right into the sign.....
And she ran away.... duh!
She call a nigga peloton say she wanna ride the boy
What a total plonker
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
These cyclist are a hazard to other road users. I bet there was a long line of cars behind them, trying to overtake.
Classic Karen move
Fans are stupid.  That's not a secret.  WHO the F plans these routes down narrow roads anyway?  THEY are to blame.
All but one fan stayed to help.  Guess which fan ran away.
Any% Ruin your life speedrun.
What was going through her mind?  Unbelievable.  I would move to like northwestern Canada and stay there for a bit….
5hat fan is entirely based love her so much
I tried to think of a sport that is even more boring than the tour de France, but it turns out there aren't any.
there always that one person who just fucks everything up lmao phahah xddd
Not her fault. These are supposed to be professional riders. The riders should have avoided her. This lady is getting a bad rap. The bikers could have easily avoided her, but they were to busy trying to focus their gopros. Unreal.
She’s a woman, what do you expect ?
Legend.
How did she get away from the scene without people noticing? She wore a yellow rain jacket and the crowd near her wasn't too dense. I bet it was a women because a dude would have totally been tackled immediately after the incident if he tried to flee.
This man flopped
Stupidity of a fan is right Karen get your oversized sign off the road xD
0:49 why didn't rider scream "MOVE BITCH... GET OUT THE WAY" he didn't even try to deflect the sign ..wierd
HOPE 💜🚴‍♀️🚴🏿🚴‍♂️ Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.

They should give her a reward. She made the world's most boring sport interesting for a few minutes.
Women truly believe the world revolves around them.
Woman with the sign acting like she didn't know what she was doing causes everyone to crash and fall what a savage 😎
For anyone who was wondering they are launching an investigation to find the person who did this
hope next time she tries it in rally...
Narcissists man, always a crash with them.
this is why we can’t have nice things
FYI she is wanted and once identified is facing trial and huge fine.
Congratulations lady you messed it up for everyone.  Now they're going to have gated areas where you can't even step close to the riders when they pull out they're going to have all these rules now because of you...   You better hope no one finds your name because you will be canceled..
Caca happens.
Why does anybody wear no mask in the COVID-19 status?
They are not going slow......
So is her name karen
The tour should have signs for the riders saying “ watch out for idiots”!
its the events fault for letting people basically stand right next to the road
She has allegedly gone missing now.
bahahahaha bikes on streets suck. a true heroine.
1st place guy was so happy on the video. Maybe he send that person to commit this act.
She immediately fled the country. She knew she messed up big time
Let's be honest, most interesting thing to happen in a bike race. More views than the actual event gets.
Top view 0:34 Front view 0:48
These guys worked so hard for this moment only to be ruined by stupidy!! Hope they catch her ass!
Fan: "Hey! You knocked over my sign!... pfff, amateur biker".
I slowed the video down and yellow jacket person had foot and rest of leg and stretched out fully arm holding sign in the road. Idiot.
It’s like that guy that interfered with that foul ball at the Cubs game years ago. Just be a spectator not a douche!
Talk about the most embarrassing thing ever in your life
Looks almost stages
What a legend
Hahaha, in any other sport there would be barriers lining each side of the track after the start and before the finish. This has been an accident waiting to happen for years now.
Alien won't come here... they hate women here.
She James Bonded her way out of the county too lmao
She is my new hero
01:56 that person deserve everything including stay in prison for a year.
This is why we have fences, people
Should have used the bell
"You get what you fucking deserve"
Well, now that person will be known for her stupidity in the whole world
Where's lance armstrong when you need him!
Where's lance armstrong when you need him!
100% a woman
See you in 10 years future people
Attention grabbing roastie puts a lot of people i  the hospital with collapsed lungs and cuts that require stitching because she wanted her 10 seconds of fame.
I'm told the sign was a shout-out to the fan's grandparents. Pretty sure she's getting written out of the will as we speak. XD
comportement égoïste typique de Karen
The only thing worse than the injury and damage caused by this reckless, selfish and opportunistic piece of meat, is the sheer number of commentators that get a kick out of watching the carnage and go on to make misanthropic statements
This is the equivalent of throwing a bucket of water over the torch bearer.
GOLD. even better no one was seriously hurt.
Could imagine Michael Scott from the office doing something this to promote rabies awareness
It looks like one of those born a male but became an it!
Many runners were injured because of that silly person! Some even had to quit the competition! She will be sued, yeah.
Hope she does jail time.  And pays a hefty fine.
Stupid person's day in hell!
imagine finding out about this 7 years later because of the algorithm.
Knocked down by a piece of cardboard..LOL
One day that sign will be sold at auction. BTW couldn't they have restarted the race considering how serious the crash was - I heard there was injuries?
At a start of a big race like this, they should add barricade so spectators can not come out because people are really mad like this women I mean reallllyyyyyy mad
This is so fkn funny
That woman is like a real life Jacques clouseau
Well now she has the attention of the French police for sure
This is an effect of social media addiction
It's alright, half of them are so hopped on steroids I doubt they'd even feel it.
It almost appears she did it on purpose, what is she expecting to happen when she takes one of the racers out?
Who ever thought having hundreds of cyclers riding within decimetres from one another while also having no kind of protection from spectators was a good idea? That's like having a NASCAR competition in the middle of a forest.
idiots be idioting
The fan was frustrated... 5 years ago he had to follow a group of 30 riders up a canyon road, taking the entire lane.  He vowed revenge.
The #1 thing about this crash is: why are fans close enough to touch the riders allowed in the Tour de France?
How the fuck, there is no a rule to stay away at least 5 meters
She is not a clown she’s the whole circus
How tf did cardboard ruin the tour de France
Lmfao
Why do I feel like she did it on purpose
When the video has a red circle and it's actually not clickbait.
Green hair, seems par for the course
The most terrible thing about this, is people think this is fun.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ALLEY-OOP!
Hi !  answer me when we will be in 2031
ALLEZOPI OPII
why this video is recommended to me when it is 2034
See you in a few years when it gets recommended...
Erika Knudsen does it again. It figures
0:50
😂😂😂😂😂
Wow
Why in the fuck would they have fans standing that close to everyone biking? LMAO
fcuk social media zombies
RIGGED!!!!!!!!!
Spectatin' a little too hard, mate.
Women.
how do they just allow people to be right next to the bikers
Good
I hope she gets heavily fined for that, people want to watch the race not you and your sign, get the F##k out of the way.
French spectator
Come on this is Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙈🤣🙈🤣🙈🙈🤣🙈🤣🙈🤣🙈
Whos here from Penguinz0?
How early on in the race was this? Did they restart it?
Red and white stripe top, black hair and glasses ?  Wheres wally ?   Dressed like one, behaved like one ..........
Satan wins
Distance and barriers between riders and fans from now on. Make her pay for some of those construction costs.
Gold
Ha lol
This woman has caused one of the worse crashes in Tour de France. Currently the police are looking for her as she fled the scene. She injured 21 riders, and could face legal action from organisers and a year in jail. Could also possible be fined £13,000
Dayum
I hope they find that idiot.
This woman should be arrested.
as Bill Burr Said: there is no reason to hit a women.
Love it!!
So french, runs into carboard sign, crumbles like nazi germany invades
What a stupid woman ! Why are people so close to the riders anyway ??
I can't stand Adult Sports but I hope they sue her until she's bankrupt. She clearly wanted attention as she is not even looking at race and she could have easily have killed someone, a rider or a spectator. Women looking for attention once again in a narcissistic world.. Surprise, surprise.
So can I buy that sign as an NFT?
Karen exists in all countries
2020: Peloton, greatest year ever! 2021: Peloton, kill me now!
🚵🏻🚴🏾‍♀️🚴🏿🚴‍♂️💥🚨🚑 Somebody is NOT going to be visiting “granny and granddad" for a very long time…unless it is in jail.👵🏻🧓🏻  Dear Lord!🤦🏽‍♀️
of course it had to be a woman
I hope she gets into jail
This is why we can't have nice things.
Correction. That's not a fan! That's an opportunistic Worthless Generation Z  piece of shit,  trying to get internet clicks. You should ban all signs from here on out. And fine that individual to the max. In fact. lets go ahead and post that individuals name so we can do it right.
I feel bad for her. She was clearly trying to create a wonderful memory for her grand parents but it went terribly wrong. I think a public apology would be sufficient.
I’m sure that she is gonna sue everyone for assault to add insult to injury. Lol, freaking idiot.
She's only caused an accident in a shitty bike race that literally nobody cares about...... people in the comments going on as if she's a paedophile or child murderer for crying out loud
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Karma for all those asshole bikers that could care less about traffic laws or pedestrians. You all know what I’m talking about. Most bikers are complete douche bags.
10 years in jail minimum
Wheres that guys channel??
I’m surprised it doesn’t happen more often, some spectators behave like idiots
Buy that fan a beer!
this fan tried to interfere and cause damage to multiple riders, this should be sentenceable
She must feel like such a loser causing all tha chaos ahahaha
anything for social media 🤡😂
I hope she gets a huge fine.  That rider got ran over along with all the other pro riders.  They train year round to compete at the highest level just to have an idiot like that ruin it for them.
The banner in the video is fucking awful.
soon as you bring fans back to sports they don’t know got to act 😂😂
That fan deserves a "Here's your sign" award.
Gotta make an example out of this "fan". I don't want to see someone's life ruined over one idiotic decision, but significant fines and real legal consequences need to happen here to dissuade future fans from doing something similar. I don't want to see stricter rules for the 99.9% of fans that behave normally,  but you have to send a message.
We need more sign people
...and that photo will cost a little. 😂
Now if that had been Group 'B' rallying that never would have happened. Much safer.
stupid roadies
Maybe they should have had barriers up. If I was her I would sue the tour de France.
Opi & Omi: Allez to you, disowned one.
Ha ha ha Lycra wearing wankers taken down by cardboard
Stupid fan
Aw she got her 5 seconds of fame now she’s back to her shitty life 🥰
I am surprised this doesn't happen every year
Am so sad at the woman. Those riders ride long kms. They need space. Get well everyone injured. Good luck for the future.
CeeUNextTuesday comes to mind...!!??
The woman who caused the accident has fled the scene. She should be held accountable.
There goes what you wish for. To become famous and get your face shown in global televesion
Come on blame to her! Thanks to her at least ive known today there were tour of France!!!
Lol 😆
This wouldn’t have happened if minority report was a real thing
the most exciting thing to ever happen to bicycle riding.  still not very exciting
.....i thought it was kinda awesome
In her best Steve Urkel voice: "DID I DO THAAAAT?" 🤓
She is work for a sniper. Disgraceful and idiotic
are ppl just ignoring how these cyclists could have, and probably were, seriosuly injured???
Sign said: caution! Sign in way.
Does anyone know what happened to the first biker that fell, is he ok? My goodness, what a mess!
That first guy who fell ate shit bad. She should be in jail for how hard he hit his head on the ground alone.
What does the sign say?
Well her life just changed forever
😂 😂 😂 😂 🤦🏽‍♂️
the only surprising thing is that shit like this does not happen more often
She got the attention she wanted.
Holy crap
big one
This is like playing with an umbrella by swinging it around in a million dollar art gallery
Pro cyclist but falls because of a sign and a little bit of arm 😂😂😂
i need to start holding signs on public roadways so these cyclists stay off of them
Reminds of the cubs game when the fan caught the ball!!!
0:47
See you all in a decade 👍🏻👍🏻
The woman as soon as she saw everyone fall: I shouldn't have done that I should not have done that
That woman written the history ever in Tour de France. Her face will always be remember than the winner of this year!! 😂
How did nobody grab her all fuckin useless
At least it made this a little more exciting
Without the spectators and fans there would be no Tour De France.
bloody cyclists. vehicles need to give way to pedestrians who are already crossing
"You going to jail now! You going to jail now!"
When she waits for the train, she stands on the train track too.  Smh
Hilarious
01:57 YEP CLEAR AS DAY SHE is Holding a Big sign LOOKIN THE WRONG WAY showing off..
Maybe some kind of barrier to separate spectators from the course would be a good idea........nah, that's makes too much sense.
Let's hope karma goes medieval on this broad.
You love to see it.
Hey lady, that is NOT how you express to the world love for your 8 cats...
She needs to be arrested! Much worse than "streaking" across a soccer pitch!
Dress like a freak.  Act like a freak.  Get hunted like a freak.  I would hate to be her right now.
Spero venga denunciata
Hope she gets jailed for this or at least a fine, bet this was a political stunt.
At least she made this event somewhat interesting.
They'll get her, she'll be found.
bro what do u even say after causing something like that
Cyclists are the worst….  Sign shoulda been bigger!
Stupid KAREN!!  THEY MESS UP EVERYTHING
This is so sad,hope they find her cough (4chan) cough and lock her up,sending prayers to the riders involved we need 4chan to track her down
Here's hoping that "fan" suffers greatly for this.
Remember to verify your clocks guys
What does the sign say
A woman..........................
Hard to believe a piece of cardboard could cause that much carnage.
What a cupid stunt...
Come on Grandma Grandpa
Hope that fan gets jail time and heavily fined.
“We are suing this woman who behaved so badly,” race deputy director Pierre-Yves Thouault said. ”We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this don’t spoil the show for everyone. That has to happen to stop these reckless people from doing stupid things like this.
Hits a bit of cardboard and falls off.......
She’s my hero best thing the tour had to offer 😂😂😂
No prosecution, no trial. Straight to the grave with that fool.
Wie ein Ameisenhaufen 😂
In the district of north Puglia (Italy) we would define that spectator "trimone a vento" (handjob at wind)
The aftermath looked terrible. Riders covered in blood. Get well soon. Sue that criminal though
Punish her to the full extent of the law, her absolute stupidity risked the health and wellbeing of dozens of competing athletes!
The sign was an advertisement for Band-Aides and crutches
Haha
I think she fully intended on causing a crash. That's why she fled.
Just like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.
I'll bet whomever the grandpa (opi) and grandma (omi) are referring to in the spectator's sign, they're just mortified right now at the stupidity of their granddaughter.
Does anyone know what the sign says??
She's going to face to public's wrath like that guy who tried to catch that foul baseball during the Major League Baseball championship match in between the Cubs and Marlins.
Stupidity at its finest...
French police now looking for her. Could face a year in prison lollllll
Omg he destroyed her sign! Outrageous, she should call corporate.
That lady is as stupid as the yellow Watch Live - FloBikes banner blocking 1/3 of the screen.
I feel bad for the poor bicyclists who piled up there! I was like 😳😲😬🙈😮
Embarrassed 😳
Damn riders hitting fans
She signed off on a bad note.
She looks like your typical liberal
This makes my day 😂Stupid cycling morons!!
https://youtu.be/QPxvS9smVDc
I could watch this all day if this happened frequently.
Allez Opi Omi...idioata...idioata...
We need to find this woman so we can make her the patron saint of motorised vehicles
We are looking at the women
This should ruin their life. Their narcissism caused countless injuries whether or not they’re severe isn’t the point.
Didn't even help out just faded
This is the most exciting thing to ever happen in Tour de France period!
Suspend her 'P' pass.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
The "Look at me!" generation.
What a prat!!!!!!
Anything to get the shot. Gotta get those likes and the endorphin rush that go with them.
Imagine if Nascar was just on public streets and other cars were allowed to drive alongside the track...   The whole setup is stupid.
Tour de Farce.
To be fair he could have rung his bell
Imagine being that front guy getting the Win because everyone else fell
Disaster girl, hold my beer.
Lol
Some people just need a high five. In the face. With a chair.
Karen crashing a bunch of Kens..lol
All girl fans are dumb.
“Stupidity of a fan”…true
You can tell she is posing for a cammera across the road. This culture of self promotion is something we need to work on as a society and as individuals. This detachment from the environment and the present moment is the most unhealthy thing for any community or person. We need to condemn artificial pose or we will be swallowed up by our own image.
Have they caught French Karen yet?
Stupid woman could of killed someone. Sue her and ban her from sporting events for 5years
I can´t wait for the memes
Then again, good to see cyclist knobs crashing. Wish the selfish bellends di the same near me, you know the ones that refuse to use the £3 million cycle lane and use the narrower road and hold up traffic, and these lycra knows wonder why we hate them. Oh  and I cycle too but I'm not a selfish bellend.
Too funny 😂
Definitely a Karen.
I’ll probably get this recommended in a few years lmao
GHIGLIOTTINA
Le Idiot
Cancel social media lol. Use social media to spread the word.
🤣🤣🤣 Hilarious!!
I hope she's jailed for a long time as well as sued
HAHAHA GJ woman :DDDDDDD
After that police hunting for her
Hey ppl from 2028. How Is It?
Well, the next time they call us stupid….
That’s the lebron james of cycling.
Public road ??
Completely disgraceful
And how long did the rider prepare for this race who is now withdrawn from competition due to injuries? They need to put her in jail and make a good example out of her or should I say bad example out of her.
Banned voor life
Is she stupid??
Did they ever find her ?
That person better find a safe house 😂
There should be a criminal investigation 🔎
That's pathetic you would think a pro wouldn't get knocked down so easily.
Hahaha😂😂
I feel likena GoT style walk of shame through the streets of Paris is the only appropiate punishment for this disgusting being.
This is unbelievable people training whole year for this moment know she took their dream she should be charge
I hope that elbow hurts for ever.
How to get famous,  fuck up a major sporting event, job done famous idiot
Find this person and sue her.
Haha you all are a bunch of fools who cares this is your life. Breath it in. Aaaah
Even more things to tell your past self would happen in the future, that your past self won't believe
Mega ultra maxi Stupid espectator 0:50
Why is this coming up in my feed in 2035?
It's shocking legal action isn't taken more often for these kinds of things. Set more damn examples.  This is completely intolerable.  What if one of the athletes was severely injured from this crap.
Strike !! 🎳🎳
And all these years I just thought Peleton was the name of the company owner!!
the woman shaming need to stop!!!!!!!!!!! he just had to keep his eyes on the road and swerve #Stand4Woman
“Good fences make good neighbors” And better races…not the first ridiculous crash caused by the fans being too close.
Entitlement at work
Wonder what the feminist will say about this one
Jail time for idiocy
sign says hello grampa & grandma! ih they saw you alright, idiot
probably a vegan
*bruh*
And in the UK the Prime Minister and Health Minister unnecessarily kill 150,000 people and everyone cheers them.
Average biker
They should throw the book at her. Preferably as she rides past at speed.
The punishment should be she holds the sign up at the Monaco Grand Prix
This women should be found and punished
What did the sign say
Les gens sont vraiment trop stupides. Pauvre fille, j'espère qu'elle est fière d'elle....
Imagine if they were football players
Almost a Darwin Award candidate
Maybe terror attack/sabotage if you look close one of the guys she/he is with is laughing only guy in the frame that finds it funny and you can see his face 100% he is up the hill a bit would not be the first time a big event is targeted like this
Report all the spam video links in the comments that are not related to this.
How the hell did he not see the sign ???
Lmfaoooo, YES!!!!! 🤣👍
Leftist. Guaranteed.
Wow
Her grinning moronic face.  Infuriating.
Would love her to do that at a F1 race.
She made it, she is famous now.
https://youtu.be/LxcBk97j2I0
https://youtu.be/LxcBk97j2I0
It's typical for people on bicycle not to look where they're going, and not to respect traffic signs. Nothing unusual here.
Hope she get sued! This falls can cause fatal injuries, broken bones and lifelong performance issues. This was just stupid, she is an attention seeker
No more fans at the side please
2 things I’ve learned today. 1. A peloton is a group of racing cyclist, not just a brand of online classes. 2. There is no limits to human stupidity.
The sign says Get money in English
Some prison time will do
She did the world a favour.
Hope she gets a lawsuit
She better leave France ASAP, she’ll be tarred and feathered...
LOL 😂😂😂
Thats why people shouldnt be allowed on the tarmac when they pass. I whould say let have 2 motorbikes infront that pushed everybody back
Seriously - just use fences - dont cry about fans who are "too close' to the cyclists. Those riders pass standing humans/objects with 40 km/h plus. Nobody should be surprised this will happen over and over again.
Ce qui m’attriste le plus c’est que les cyclistes qui ne sont pas tombés continuent leur route et n’aident pas les potentiels blessés question de solidarité 🤷🏽‍♀️
I like the yellow anorak.
Beautiful
What kind of flower gets knocked off his bike by a cardboard sign?! Not like he didn’t see it coming. 😂😂
Quelle idiote
Shitfan
Sorry, but what a dope!
When you wanted attention... And got what you asked for.
00:48
She fled the scene haha to go where. I’m in trouble . No worries we can flee to another country. Don’t worry about it anyway I’m sure you didn’t mention anything on social media about you going and getting on camera. Yes I did. You’re fooked then Mrs. Tears then and I didn’t mean it I just wanted to make a statement.
So funny watching these idiots drop like dominoes🤣😅😂
Why couldn't this have happened at a Rally Car race?
"FAN" ? More like attention hungry narcissist who just wanted some TV coverage to say "Go, Grandma & Grandpa" with her stupid sign. Should've sticked to Tik Tok.
it was just a matter of time until this happens. I really dont understand why all the fans are standing THAT close to the road. And why they are allowed to do so.
HAHAHAHA very good lol
Stupidly at its best, she kept holding the sign in theyre path instead of drawing it back,I hope she pays the price
Who would have thought, sport made up of sted-heads and lyrca louts, attracts numbskull spectators......
After watching that idiot with the sign, I'm actually relieved that I'm OK not needing attention so bad that I would be willing to do that kind of crap to get it!
We also have car drivers sounding their horns just behind cyclists to intimidate them, getting along side far too close to hurl abuse. It seems kind of socially acceptable to be ignorant twats. Lots of training ruined by an idiot.
why cant this kid just keep their stupidity to themself. SMH
The flobikes advertisement needs to fucking God, can't see a damn quarter of the screen
Bell-end
Should be become a new mobile game. Block the path to cause the biggest pile up 😄
What has she got to be narcissistic about? She looks like she has a ball bag for a face.
The ultimate selfie will land her in jail for quite some time. But the humiliation will last for the rest of her life
The commentator was not paying attention, either. Everyone blames the spectator, yet anything, any incident could cause the same pile-up. It's very unfortunate. The spectator cannot be liable for all that. A pot-hole, a rock or stick, a slipped chain, would do exactly the same thing. Cause a pile-up.
I wanna know what she did right after she caused the crash…did she quickly take off her brightly coloured jacket ditch her sign and try to blend in with crowd? Where she go?
🤣😂🤣😂
I have zero interest in endurance competitive cycling but I find myself offended by this person's actions. Make an example of her in front of her grandparents.
jail jail jail jail
LOL
I'll never understand why they let people so damn close to the racers.  It's gotten worse and worse in recent years and sadly it was only a matter of time before this happened.
Police are currently trying to identify her. She could face up to a year in prison. Apparently several teams are looking to sue her too. Madness.
How did she even manage to get away?
She should go.in.jail
Can that woman please be charged with reckless endangerment or something?
She likely got whiplash….
What did the sign even say, was it eve relevant?
She should be arrested, charged, imprisoned and sued!
Goddamn wish they would of hurt them way more
This person will get more than 15 minutes of fame after causing this wreck. Should be a What not to Do as a Spectator video
No. It wasnt "one rider that hit a fan". It was "a stupid, careless, vain and self centered fan that hit a rider"
*Perpetrator flees the scene*  Me: “You’ll get no sympathy from me.”
Got done by a flimsy bit of cardboard 🤣 that payback for riding two abreast.
That crash is just like the biden presidency.
Lmfao
Title should be "Narcissistic bitch ruins years of training of Tour de France competitors"
That was so funny!
French police are actively searching for this women to charge her with criminal offences.
Decap and quarter!
Opi Omi is German or Finnish?
TDF is suing her.
Hmm now they "can't find" her and look at what she's wearing. I think someone just wanted to start a real life 'Where's Waldo?' game.
I don't know why, but I find this Very Staged
If she was hoping to be noticed, she got her wish. There's a pretty clear image of her, she'll probably be caught soon.
I'm sorry nobody died
what did the sign say "I'm a massive cunt"
Imagine being that person.
This should be a punishable crime. I bet every fan will look the race 5 meters away
I'm probably the only one who feels mortified for the woman. I mean, she's just a human being. We all have moments where we did something thoughtless that we came to regret. This is a WHOPPER of a mistake, but it wasn't malicious. The aftereffects on this woman's life -- and the lives of the contenders whose chance to win were taken away from them -- are going to be devastating! Apparently she is being sued.
She’s the Steve Bartman of cycling
someone needs to be doxed
This makes me so mad
This woman's stupidity is going to kill someone. Imagine her driving your bus, or operating on you 😳
This karma for all the times race bikers act like complete assholes on public highways ✌️
Bless her.  It was an accident and I'm sure she's feeling terrible for causing so much damage.  We don't want guilt to consume her.
-*Human stupidity is infinite* -Einstein. *Karen stupidity race is on*
they were all going too fast
She's due a huge fine and jail sentence.
Man, I wonder what that's like trying to just drive straight down the road with some asshole taking up the right side of the road where they obviously don't belong?
So much Bad luck happening lately. Like this Seems kinda Fake almost 👀
Will she be fined or something?
What she did was stupid, selfish, dangerous and horrible, and it led to damage she did not intend. I wonder if anyone else in this comment box has done something stupid, selfish, dangerous and horrible, that led to damage they did not intend? Consequences? Yes, but bearing with her obvious failure here as you all would love others to do if they saw you at your worst moment might be worth adding to the mix. Unless all of you are free from such reckless choices in life and have never hurt others (physically or otherwise) by your carelessness. Worth considering?
This is the most entertaining thing about this sport. Lol
Pro cycing is the most brutal sport of all. Some of ther crashes are insane. And hardly any protection for riders when they smash into the concrete. And then another 10 bikes ride straight over your back because there is no way they can avoid you. Brutal
👍🏻
I feel so bad for them. I wish people would be less egoistic
She was just trying to show a sign of god is a woman
What a dummy. She should haze herself/itself whatever it identifies as.
she wanted the camera to see her...now whole world looked at her. i heard the police looking for her too hahaha  congratulation
She's being sued and she deserves it. Stupid
It's like watching a bunch of expensive dominoes fall.
It’s past time for new rules regarding spectators on most tours. Hopefully it will be instrumented today.
HAHA now she's world famous
About time they started putting fences in villages. Enough's enough.
0:34 crash scene at left above
Shouldve put stingers out, not just their sign
I hope that idiot woman goes to jail!
1 word STUPID
Как это у французов? Если женщина не права, мужчина должен извиниться.
She should be banned from the World ...
Woman... Typical ehh
People watch cycling? You learn something everyday
Prison’s too good for this stupid woman
She’s Protesting  ? Anyone know what for ?
first macron got slapped and now this. lmao France
welp, cya in 5-7 years when this vid gets recommended to everyone
I think it's now important they put a specified distance between everyone else and the bikers. It's unfortunate that some of these bikers would sustain injuries worth thousands of dollars and would take a long time to heal, along with therapy all because one person wants to be on tv or social media.
It's the narcissistic idiots like this that ruin the fun for everyone else
The only reason the Tour de France was worth watching.
She should go watch a WRC race...
So many guys here who definetly aren't cyclists and think that Tony Martin (the rider who crashed first) could have handled this better...🙄
Beautiful 😍
omi & opi is German for grandma & grandpa.
Should have given Grandma and Grandpa a wide berth))
DOUBLEKILL!! QUADRAKILL!!!!!! GODLIKE!!!!!!!!!       Nice job teamate!!
France should really make it a hard rule/law that people can't stand close to the road where the riders will pass by, and fine and/or jail people that cause these kinds of messes! Imagine fans are allowed to interact this closely with all other sports.
Muuahahahahahahahahah!
Quel conard quand même
I am gasping for air
KKKkkKkkKkK
It’s getting harder to get Instagram likes nowadays
Well they can’t blame the motorist on this one, always someone else’s fault when they fall of,
poor girl, didn't think that whole thing through.
I'm telling y'all clout chasing is becoming a severe issue. She has to pay for the damage.
This is awesome! I hate bicyclists, as they're douche bags.
Strike!!
Encore une conne a l origine d une connerie🤦🏻
I don't understand why they are allowed to stand as close to the road ...
I'm glad to see that she's getting legal action taken against her and it'll be nice to think that others who attempt to do stupid things like this see that and think better of it!  I hope all the cyclists in the peloton are all OK and not seriously injured.
I would not like to be in her shoes now
These Karens ruin everything
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven   God bless you
0:15 · Great advert for helmets
Strike !!!!
The helmet saved his life as he landed on the side of head. So any anti helmet wearers please take note
hope she’s as miserable as the guy from the cubs game that caught the foul ball
Probably because of this. The other spectators are gonna suffer because of her actions...
I think the organizers including security are at fault here, too! Unfortunately, when you have hundreds of spectators, you can’t expect everyone of them to use common sense.
😂 😂 😂 The number of riders they have in  this thing is just asking for trouble
What a legend 😂😂
ТП.
the race organization are now going to sue this lady, I thought it was a boy, for causing this in hopes it will make fans more likely to stay off the road.
https://youtu.be/SXd4m2VxJ4E
did  they get her?
Love watching cyclists crash. Their like fûcking lemmings. 1 goes down at front it’s chaos :))
What an utter moron. The spectators ruin the Tour De France
Clearly there for her own ego, and using a famous sporting event  knowing there would camera's just to get her fat face on TV. Charge that women with first degree stupidity.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Brilliant 👏 give her a medal 🏅. I really enjoyed every second of that crash 😁
As a cyclist, I have to ask why they couldn't space out a little  It's clearly bad practice 😜
I’m just glad the fan wasn’t an American
Has authorities caught her?
Flocycle would be a cooler name
This is awesome. Fucking hate cyclists 🤣
K, so, once we find this fan - force her to run ahead of the peloton as the bike riders chase her all over France, swinging bike chains above their heads.
😡
Everyone gets 15 minutes of fame.. and she will when she’s in court.
It's a pity she didn't get hurt... 😒
That spectator must be fucked.
https://youtu.be/YASfcY-MARc
Death penalty at minimum.
and the she diseappear, stupid and coward
A part of me feels for her. The consequences she now faces for her blatant stupidity will be severe.
Fucking hilarious, it always is.  Slapstick comedy at its finest.  Oh? Someone may have been hurt?  Sucks to be an athlete sometimes, get over yourself.
Godo un botto
Needs to be a witch hunt for this woman. She wanted to be on camera well she'll get all the publicity now.
Woman moment 😳👌🏻
Bikers having an orgy.
Typical self entitled female.  All about her and destroys men.
The sign says “go (French) grandpa and grandma (German)”
If someone had died, manslaughter?
is the announcer blind? It's clear as day some dumb ass fan hit the cyclist. She needs to be charged big time and each of the cyclists need to sue her.
Elle voulait passer à la TV, elle fait les gros titres maintenant, la conne 😪
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Women Moment
Wanted to be spotted, so goal has been achieved. Now everybody knows how recklessly stupid you can get. Is it the limit? Don't think so.
Lock her up as well. Thanks to her some of the favourites are out of contention.
Perfect Strike !!!!
the best moment of "tour de france" was about sleeping, and made my day
Some people just deserve a good smackdown
Sorry I find this hilarious 😂
What a selfish prick
She should be charged, she literally cause up to dozens of injures because of her idiocy
I still just wonder the gender of that person.
Do they....do they need some milk?
Hahahahaha
Ну ей хоть один велосипед затолкали в известное место ? Или об тупую бошку разбили ?
Bloody À hole
Did they restart?
Idiot should be prosecutes for criminal damage. His reckless act just cost thousands
haha  😄
Thought that was good? Watch this! It’s super motivational!  I guarantee it’s the greatest thing you’ll ever watch!!  LINK: https://youtu.be/cQ1zwlaxC3Q
When the shit hit the fan, no sorry ... when the shit fan was hit!
😂😂😂
thats why i always drive a tank,its much safer
Security fell asleep... btw is there any security????
Paha. She’s completely fucked
I hate all these “influencers” and “me me me, it’s all about meeeeeeee….look at meeeeeeeeee” people who do anything for THEIR best photo. 🙄😖  She clearly was in the bikers path and didn’t give a shit about anything but her pic. You can take your photo on the sideline like anyone else.  This is terrible. It sucks. They all train long and hard. She certainly didn’t care. It is all about her.   Now, we do not have true stats nor true winner as who knows what would have happened. 🤔😖
GG to her. Bruh come on.
Security Barriers...just a suggestion...
Even when not on the road, these females are a pain in the ass
Sue her and bring her to prison!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi-3I80YtgM
i’m going to hell for laughing
Does anyone know if the French still have that prison on Devil's Island open?
Real life lion king! Smh
絶対に犯人を特定し報いを受けさせて欲しい。マラソンやF1とかでも起きてきたけど絶対許してはならない。
Why would anyone do that? What's wrong with her?
Hope the woman gets arrested for getting dozens of people in danger.
C'est loin d'être la première fois que ça arrive, j'imagine pas comment les cyclistes doivent en avoir marre des spectateurs comme ça
Lol! A piece of cardboard!
Peaceful protest!
In my opinion she has to go to jail. That is a criminal act against the cyclists who have trained for months on this. It;s a shame.
She should be sued by every rider
https://youtu.be/I0cBK17_6f0
https://youtu.be/4UqrtybLHRc ❤️
She is a he according to reports..
She did it on purpose?
The police are looking for this woman.
Looks like Tony Martin elbowed her in the face...this is the SELFIE generation, folks....
What a idiot! I hope nobody was seriously injured
This just hurts to watch
"nice Instagram pic".... NOT
She is defenetily stupid, but she hasn't done it on purpose. I would feel sorry for her to go into jail or pay millions in reperations... Everyone makes mistakes, this one is a huge once in a lifetime mistake...
I hope tour de france sue the shit out of her.
Uhh where's Chris Brown when you need him
Fine that stupid Karen
Gender Fluid... and be more feminine.
You’re telling me that some kind of professional bike rider is taken down by a piece of cardboard?   Are these cyclist also soccer players?
She/he can't be blamed. She/he is a woman.
She run away. Is she captured??
Hilarious!
Plz plz plz make a good example out of her
Over-eager fans like that are the primary reason why the World Rally Championship have designated spectator areas and no-go-zones *clearly marked-out and fenced* for 35 years and counting. Perhaps it's time for pedal-bike racing to do the same thing.
These people are idiots. Where are Marshalls on motorcycles. They need to keep these people back. Just ridiculous
Quite a silly thing to do yea but I actually hope she’s never found or prosecuted, like a ghost! It will be more interesting when I watch this again in 10 years or so  Remember that mysterious woman who ruined a race and disappeared lol
rennradfahrer sind sowieso solche opfer.. der sport gehört verboten.
If they find out who she is then she's good for a 1500 euro fine and, perhaps,  prosecution .
Dang he got trampled like in cartoons
Why is it always women? They definitely trying to make men hate women.
Retirez les spectateurs comme ca il ni aura pas de chute!
Lmfao
Outstanding performance
Does someone know what happened to her after the crash ?
Honestly she could have killed someone. That cyclist went under several bikes and had a few fall on him. She should be fined and banned.
she need to be found asap and have a ticket! then France should make a stamp of her face making it an example of stuppid
Straik
Sign larger than 2” X 2”  will be banned forever on Tour de France.
Jailtime incomming...
Why they not canceled race? Its not fair
Her face changes when she gets hit! So funny!! hahaha
I blame Antifa. 😁👍
What does her sign say?
She deserves to be banned from every race (bike, moto GP, F1, horse, etc)!
It only takes one moron at these events? 😆
Thanks for deleting my comment, YouTube.
He made it in life
Of course it was a woman ...
So she just got away with it???shouldn't she be charged or something
! D i 0 t A
Didnt watch it but i bet its a woman and a femnst too...SPD AF as always...
They let hundreds of people stand practically right on the road only to be shocked and outraged when this kind of stuff happens?  Pretty obvious looking at the video that safety standards were non-existent.
C'est la première fois que je m'intéresse au tour de France
What did the sign say?
This is why we used to have stocks. So the whole town could throw rotten vegetables and eggs at the silly-billy and publicly humiliate them for the tomfoolery 😆
of course she's an idiot, but the organizers are to blame too: you can't crowd so many cyclists on such a narrow road
😳
Quelle conne !!
I know this shouldn’t be funny but it is.
Spectators have responsibilities... Come on humans—be responsible.
For you idiots trying to say “the bike hit her,” THIS WAS A PRIVATE RACE. Thats like someone jumping onto a NASCAR track and the pedestrian getting hit and saying “well they had the right away.” Like seriously, really?
Holy shit that’s terrible
Stupid spectator!
Fucked now. Being charged.
I'm not into this sport however that silly individual should be absolutely ashamed these poor people have been training extremely hard for that moment and a Stupid individual goes and spoils it for them.
I really hope they press charges against that moron.  Should be sued too.
Check them for doping!!!
What’s her name stupid bint
Why are there so many dumb people on earth *talking about the "fan"
Azz-whole.
Idiot  Idiot
Tony Martin will claim self defence
Accidents will happen and while stupid, there was no mal intent involved.
at least shoutout your Twitter
Who cares, it’s a push bike race
Legit jail time I hope for that
That's why you always ride a bike in a line not side-by-side with your friends :)
She should be arrested!
one subscribe   Who ever reading this, you will be successful, just keep going.
The only thing not boring during Tour de France or other bicycle events are crash. Thanks :)
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSYH0_36ypg
I love this ha
🤬🤬🤬
Wouldn't a fence have prevented this? Why is there no fence?
She just caused thousands of dollars in damages to those bikes
lol stupid roadies
We need her to come to London & be part of a street cleaning exercise to make London’s roads safe again.
Finally! Something actually interesting in this joke of a sport 😆
Ah... Trail by social media as per in the comments...
You could see the butterfly effect here
Esse negócio foi tão absurdo que quando me mandaram esse vídeo, eu fiquei jurando que era no Brasil. A que ponto chegamos meu pai
What a gormless prick. 😄
If that person is not autistic, they deserve the death sentence
only way to save it was to legit drive more into the spectator away from the others
Hello welcome to France
She could be in trouble.
Bb
Just like nascar...only worth watching for the crashes...
I doubt that fan would do the same had it been a rally stage instead of Tour de France :(
Never ever understood why the spectators are allowed to be so close to cyclists. What if someone pulls out a knife or whatever or push one of them. Only in this sport that's allowed
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
are we not gonna hold the cyclist accountable
Red Forman voice - Dumbass
Everybody is wishing her the worst but stupid actions happen to each of us. She was unlucky to do something extremely stupid in the wrong place and time.
He only hit her arms.. he didnt have a strong grip on his bike either. He saw it coming. Shouldve held on strongly and pummeled through
A sign by God all over the place
Beautiful, i respect every sport except these "race" cycle drivers and soccer.  Had a good laugh here XD
What's bizarre is the rider who slammed right into her arm and sign didn't call, yell out or slow down (I know they really can't slow down) but to me he looked as if he didn't see her at all. The moment he went down the rider behind him looked like everything was peachy until he crashed into him. That woman needs to turn herself in. She hasn't and they are already looking for her so it sounds like to me she's not only a careless moron but she's also an ignorant coward.
Papillon effect.
😂😂😂
That is hilarious 😂😂😂
She must be banned from being alive, I'd say.
TO PEWNIE GRAZYNA NA WAKACJACH HAHAAHAH
Downhill rider stand up and ride to the finish
Comment elle est trop conne la meuf
She acted extremely foolishly however it was I believe an accident. I'm sure she is devastated enough with the potential huge fine and prison sentence without YouTubers piling in
How is that one dumb fan doing? Been sued? Fined? Banned or what? Need a news abt this fan
Baaaaaahahahahahahahaha!!!!
Faut dire que le peloton est trop dense, chute inévitable 😗
Did the idiot think there were only five riders in the race?
Should have yelled on your left.
Looks like a colony of ants
What a goddamn idiotic human waste of space... One of those stupid social media actors obviously... Put in a jail for some time, fine well, and ban for life for these events!
She should be fined
Her sign promoted best way ever,.!
Complete COVIDIOT! Oh man. Really pity the participants! Get well soon, everyone!
Well that’s gona make signs not past a certain line. Shouldn’t be that close to the road anyway
What does he sign even mean?
I'm sorry but the idea that a goofball can cause so much chaos it's so funny to me
Vraiment conne 🤬
She be responsible for all medical bills incurred by the riders!
😂🤣🥳
1:57 for anyone who wanted to see what she did
WTF!!!
What did the sign say?
She should be penalized doing prison. Luckily no one got seriously injured. Cuz it could easily have been someone loosing their life or body part. Send her to prison and big big fines. To many idiots on the way and don't face any consequences.
If the lad can't handle a bit or cardboard hitting his hand he shouldn't be on a bike.
Omg what a dick that not fan
The moment the spectator stepped out onto the road, you knew it was a bad sign.
lol
Opi and Omi:  nope, never heard of her.
0:49 Top 10 photos taken a moment before tragedy
Allez Opi Omi <3
Not quite the entire peloton but ok
Incroyable les débiles irresponsables...full stupidity 🙄
What a waste of good illegal performance enhancing drugs
In Germany we say 200er IQ🤔
What a painfully dumb fan
Has she been sued already?
I hope she gets sued multiple times
stupid people are dangerous
The idiot caused a lot of injuries. That "fan" should be charged for causing so much harm to the riders
There should have always been a gate to block these people from being that close to the road anyway and security standing guard. Obviously something would eventually happen.
“A fan”
Without a helm, Tony Martin cut be dead!
La que has liado pollito
Ils ont qu'à prendre des routes plus large Il aurait fallu annuler cette Mascarade d'étape, mais avec le branquignole de Prud'homme c'est pas gagné
Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today! He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life! The Only Way to God!
Put her in jail!
Fine the spectator at least 20 grand.
arm hit the handlebar of the rider. sh!t move on her part. unavoidable on his. but, hey, she's famous now!
First law of moronics: it only takes one.
Lol nerds
She should be charges with attempted murder this could have ended very badly
Women sign holders tut tut....
Anyone else find this hilarios
Clown 🤡 with sign ahead! Someone should have gave the guys a sign 🪧 🥇❤️‍🩹✊🏼
Cherchez la femme
It's disappointing seeing that just one person's immature action can immediately turn the whole thing upside down. Literally punish this woman.
She's unattractive, she's wearing bright, tacky yellow... I think "AllezOpi-Omi" might mean "Freedom for Catalonia (PS: We're really this stupid)" 🤣🤣🤣  Honestly, I feel she's going to feel lousy enough about this for a long time, so I think hating on her without measure might be a bit much.
Best thing I have seen this year!!!! Love when I see cycling crashes
I cannot understand the lady with that plate who caused the accident is not accountable for her act. Riders are doing their profession.
Organization failed big time.
👍👍👍😁😁😁
"Self-promotion" caused this accident. This "cherry" should be banned from being a spectator!!
She is a lover of self, obviously    🙄
SMASHING!!!
I'm not gonna lie. That was satisfying and I would do it too lol
that woman is going to be crucified
Ah, the sign got wrecked, must have taken such a long time to make. I hope they had crayons with them to make another.
The funny thing is they haven't found her yet
I'm sure she's delighted with herself.
Куча-мала
Fine her ass, this is so uncool, ruining months of hard work for a stupid photo bomb.
Espero que la encuentren y la encarcelen
That fan is done for. Not only they will confront legal charges but also imagine all the hate that person must suffer in the next years. I also heard in the news that the fan will probably end up in jail and paying a ton of money for the trouble and the injuries they caused. That person's life is ruined... just because of a photo.
The Fan should be jailed. No Questions. 6 week minimum. + Public Service.
She should face a serious action as a consequences, so she will be an example for anyone who will try same immaturity and  idiotic behavior.
Allez!…she probably has green armpit hair
look at the other people tryna get ahead lmao
😂😂😂😂😂
Plot twist: she's blind you sick f*cks..
I hope then spectator is OK and her granny and grandad do come on.
what a Wally
Why are people allowed to be so close to the riders?  That alone is dangerous to allow that close proximity to the riders.  Wow.
That “ fan “ is an irresistible person , selfish !
P0RC0D10
omg she just ended her own life
What a chad. Someone should give her a medal!
What was on the sign?
This does put a smile on my face
RIP
How thick can you be....?
They should ride🚵‍♀️🚵‍♂️🚵‍♀️🚵‍♂️🚵‍♀️🚵‍♂️ too close together
What does the sign say???
Apparently, she legged it straight afterwards 🤷 the authorities are looking for her.
غصخففث
Silly sign!!
What an idiot, covid turned the clock back
Has been paid for Gates, Bill Gates
😱😱😱😱😱😱
This is the kinda video that will be recommended to people 10/11 years later   Edit : I will came back to this exactly on 28th June 2031. (If possible considering other circumstances) if you were/are here and are out there on 28, June 2031, reach out, I hope we see each other on that day.
I don’t understand, what does the words mean the woman have the board…??  So terrible accident
Probably the most interesting part of the race
I wonder how it feel too fuck up the whole tour da France
I'd bet $1000 that woman was a liberal democrat.
Good luck getting money from fan..... Not her fault accidents happen
Definitely got her fame now
It's okey to slap that woman right?
a report said that she will be sued and yea she has to u cant just come in the track knowing that there are bikers coming shes going to pay for it now ;-;
1:01that bike is upside down 🤦🏿‍♂️I’d be so mad!
What an idiot, that happens when father's didnt give attention to their sons when they are children
Haha thank you i must so loud laughin  😂🤣🤣🤣 stupid drug sport
fine her fucking 10000$ set an examplle kmt
nah that was the bikers fault. you gotta know when youre about to crash into someone.
There was Helicoptercam.. why did not no one ask to put that following this stupid.... helicopter just fly above crash site..
一生かけて償わせろ
She should be arrested and charged for endangering riders.
make this stupiet women pay for ever one and every bike
Godo
Selfish woman ... should be charged!
For some reason seeing cyclists crash brings me great joy and entertainment, please share more
I'm a horrible person but something about seeing a bunch of people on bikes fall makes me so unbelievably happy
Дура, блин... Бедные ребята🤦🏼‍♀️
Why do I love seeing this
The idiot with the sign!
Come on that was the best a acting by the fist cyclists since Lebron James.
Lmao!
That woman should be arrested for injury crime
Disgusting! She is not a “fan”, should be banned for life from attending Cycling events. Hope she feels good for getting her Instagram photo 🤦‍♂️
Idiot. I hope they are all fine
Yo this guy single handedly leveled the race 😂
All about her. Unreal.
I hope the riders get better security.  The Fan is a absolutly idiot. I hope they sue this Person. Maybe opa and oma help her to pay the rent. Somebody could be killed
Why did nobody pull her back?!
So stupid
karen moment
Va arrestata
Al tour ci si può aspettare di tutto
And yet another example of this ''social media" generation, where they risk their life and lives of others for a stupid photo.
How are you that dumb? Keep out of the way!
Glad at least it wasn't a fellow American fan. It seems like something a certain type of loud mouth American woman would do.
Why are they allowed to be so close to the road?!!!!
How Stupid!!!! A race this big, this important, this costly and the TDF can't afford to rope off or put some barriers along the road to prevent morons like this to cause such a crash. The girl holding the sign is an idiot, but I blame the TDF for this. Instead of holding her responsible for this crash, I believe the TDF should pay for not protecting the riders from these idiot spectators.
She's wanted by the police, a complaint has been filled against her, she's sued for the damages, many cyclists got injured with wounds and broken bones. Elle est activement recherchée par la gendarmerie et la police. Her sign "Allez opi-omi" is a mix of French and German, it means "Go grand-father & grand-mother !"
Always wondered why the fans were allowed to stand so close in the first place?  Never looked safe in my opinion.  Damn how close do the fans need to be?  Seriously?
This happens all the time in pro cycling events, fans are an integral part of the sport and they often get in the way. The only way to stop it would be banning them on the route.  Just look at tough climbs, cyclists are literally surrounded by people as they go by at jogging pace. They are pushed, sometimes kicked and punched. They get shouted at, spat on, urine thrown on them. Many are drunk, many are idiots, some are drunk idiots. Very harsh fines may be a good option, but it will not stop this sort of clown.  There have been many other more serious incidents but organisers will always want to keep the fans at the roadside.
Fan should be changed with assault.
Virus for which there is no vaccine and humanity has been in pandemic since the very beginning: stupidity.
Tour COVID  TOUR DELTA 🤮
all because of one bellend
The fact that no one grabbed that woman immediately afterwards or that cameras did not seek her out immediately… 🙄 France.
Diagnose: Frau
What a dumb ass! They need to be banned from ever being allowed to view live sports again. Not too mention pay for the medical bills for all the injured.
To be fair, she was looking the other way, so unlike the drivers she couldn't see it coming. If the drivers paid more attention to the road they could've avoided her
Imagine how many time she will say sorry
These spectator areas should be roped off anyway to keep them at a distance from the road.
Grandparents greeted in a very special way. I do hope the Court is going to give her a lesson and it will be adequately expensive ticket to the show. God it was so dangerous.
Идиотка
A sign made me famous! 😂
Hahahaha all thise lycra nazi self worshipping egoists crashing. Made my day
とても残念だ
i saw this coming a mile away. Its a little funny
Send her straight to Guantanamo.
She is French, so she will surrender very soon.
Holy shit that was fucking stupid
こ　れ　は　ひ　ど　い
Hay que satanizar a una inocente muchacha por un accidente?  El ciclista NO tenía frenos en su bicicleta? ,,estaba drogado , dopado
Put her in the general population of a men's prison for a couple of years.
I am guessing her opi and omi will be averting their eyes in shame
meh, Tour de France's own fault for not putting stricter spectator rules in place, literally open road no barricades, what did they think would happen with muppets around. Very unfortunate, should restart so everyone gets a fair go.
Reminds me of Bobby Brown. He was a piece of shit who wasn’t looking where he should have, too.
Where's Wally? TheTour De France edition!
Mit Corona wär das nicht passiert 😂🥳👊
She knew what she was doing. Look at her posture, she looks like she is expecting a cyclist to hit the sign. She probably didn't expect for this massive pile up to happen. But either way, off to jail and a huge fine.
That kid should be arrested. He has caused injury, a lost competitor, and a fortune in damages. It's criminal.
if i were there a fight will occur
i hate that girl
What a dumb fan...
If everyone who saw this  and had their amusement paid  a euro, everything would be fine for everyone involved
dumbo
Somehow the woman responsible remindsme of Jerry Smith.
Not a fan just an idiot...
Women..!
Try that at a rally lmao
The sign is a combination of two languages, French and German. "Allez" means "go" in French, according to Google Translate, while "opi" and "omi" are German terms for "grandpa" and "grandma," - So the sign would translate to "Go grandpa-grandma."
C'est pas bonne marche, Oma et Opi!
Now it's  time for her opi and omi worry about her.
I like it that you call her a spectator and not a fan as fans wouldn't behave like that! Best wishes for a speedy recover to all the cyclists involved!!! 🙏🚴🏻🚴🏼‍♂️
Genieten geblazen dit heerlijk 🤩
Screen fool
These spectators should be severely fined ..!!! And be held liable.. if they would start this the spectator might be more respectful… they can’t hind now with all the cameras
French police are now calling for witnesses regarding this incident. Unsure of the progress because i can't read french.
責任を取って貰いましょう。妨害行為
That's hilarious!
there is always that one idiot
If I was that guy I would have told my grand kids on how I stopped a race just by standing near the road as lesson to not run without looking lmfao
apparently she fled the scene? on foot? when there's like a hundred bikes right in front of her? smh
All Cafés worldwide have a picture of her behind their counters now with "do not serve"
I'm amazed that in this day and age they're allowed to say it was a woman.
https://youtu.be/uArVzPKiD_4
That'l take the wind out of your sails, hope everyone was alright.
She stepped out, and deliberately angled that banner so it caught the cyclist as he went by. I hope she gets jailed. Years of training for these guy's, goes up in smoke in a matter of seconds.
That looks to be purposely done to me....................
STOP BASHING HER ! ...... front bikers could have easily dodged her, blame your lack of skill , she was there before they've reach to her , how could you not seeing her as road obstacle beforehand ???!!!?!!!?!!!
you can clearly see that her arm is fully extended over the road too, not just the sign.
That would of killed a soccer player
FOR ONCE IT'S NOT AMERICA DOING SOMETHING STUPID 🥳
She should cover medical expenses and equipment expenses. What a stupid behavior!
That women has stolen the show 😂😂 hahaha
She must be blind af to have not seen them coming right at her.
Do we know who this person is? Before we get too intense in our vitriol I suspect that they didn’t really have mental capacity.
Everyone learned a little french today
Did they run over his head? lol omg bike race falls are horrifying.
ほんとひどい。選手はこれに人生かけてやってきているんだし、犯人は自分のしたことに対してしっかり責任をとって欲しい。
Flimsy Cardboard  vs  Man on Bike Cardboard Wins By Attrition! Sad
Women always right.
🤣
The good news is only drug cheats have been hurt.
The spectator is a woman.  She will cry and not pay . Usual
Why do you have that stupid fucking graphic covering half the screen? I get it's the route but damn that's obnoxious.
FRANK 4-3-3
Stupid
In todays world these Cyclists are to blame they clearly came into this woman's safe space,
بعد التصادم كملوها مشي 😂
Quelle conne
If they find her she can get 12 months in jail….
わざとやった？ こんな出し方したらアカンやろ。 怪我をした方々の無事を祈ります。
😂
whoops
Il faut un cordon de sécurité 3metre
Ha ha ha - for 30 seconds this boring race became watchable
This would have not had happened if all cycists were armed. The only way to stop raging fans is to have a good cyclist with a gun. And good fans with guns, which would keep bad fans at safe distance. How else would they come through, it's a climb, for God's sake! If you ask me, the first few cyclists - the vanguard - shoud have a couple of AR-15s. I mean, with their thin shorts, they are already violating any "carry openly" laws. And officers of law inforcement should pay a visit to Opi and Omi, because they sound like heads of terrorist cells. Race for freedom!
And so a tour de france video is finally interesting
A cause d'une connasse avec son carton..
She should be fined but time
It's a public road. Dangers of the job/sport. She's still stupid though.
Haha
Look like the bike rider slammed her away and then fell I’d say bike riders fault the idiot
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Why there are so many idiots in the world?!
She's totally stupid, but she didnt do it on purpose.
She should pay for all costs + compensation for injuries or lost positions.  Perhaps that will teach idiots to keep away.
Spectators should stay away minimum 1m from both sides of the road. Thats ridiculous. Stupid selfish social media addicted idiots are all over the world nowadays.
Ale beka hahahah
She should honestly pay all of this
Stupid woman. She could've seriously hurt someone.
Lmao
She’s being sued by the organisers of the race
She's lucky it wasn't a motorcycle.
Godo
Kann man so dumm sein?
Stupid cyclist had PLENTY of time to react and avoid the sign 😄 Just looks like ur typical cyclist being arrogant about people on foot and wanted to show some aggression by ramming through the sign , but he failed and fell down. Looks to me like he still needed training wheels.
name & shame
Very funny Good from the Lady.
...She is not a Chinese
Hahahahahaha
Woman moment
🙄🙄🙄
She could be hslfway to germany now, there's no justice...
Faakkk
What a tool trying to show off this sh*ttty sign
Imagine being the person that held up the sign and being that stressed out
Quelle conne
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
Fabulous. Made my day.
Claw hammer her
Germans at ot again
чувачка надеюсь отмудохали?
That "spectator" is going down in history for fuckin' the race up just so she could show off her sign (that says "go grandma grandpa") to the cameras. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚 𝐁𝐈𝐓𝐂𝐇 𝐎𝐅 𝐀 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐀𝐔𝐆𝐇𝐓𝐄𝐑!
Hard way to get your 15 minutes.  Stupid is as stupid does.
if the sign had said "I love you, Zach Scuderi" I would have understood, but this sign just wasn't worth it 😅
"Hey opi and omi! Look what a dumbass you have made!"
I don’t know French law, will she get arrested? I hope she does.
Bike racing is fun
at 1:30, it looks like she's actually deliberately trying to hit him. "Fuck that guy in particular!" 🤣
She's going to get a year in prison lol
It was a piece of cardboard. Toughen up.
What a BELL END, When will spectators learn.
I'm sorry, with his bike skills, a paper sign should not of made him crash.
This is too dangerous. Organizer needs to put spectators at safe distance with some barrier
개념 없는 관중..저걸 확~~
stupidity indeed!
Q.I. zero....here you are 2021 brains💩💩💩
Do spectators have to be that close? Assholes
accident happens but please not in TDF
well, she's famous now... and what's the price?? idiot!!
Another Millennial trying to get instant fame. Oh wait, it worked!
Tour De France organisers DONT GIVE A FLYING SHIT!!!!
The funny thing is, this is going on for years and years and years.
Joeybtoons needs to get on this lol
Some idiot trying to get fake famous being see. On camera ruins months and years of preparation
Oh... guess a Fence will be put in place next time. All it takes is 1 person to ruined it all for everyone.
Glad to know that they're fully going to sue that idiot for all the damages. Imagine how much that would be when carbon fiber handle bars are already 10k each and she basically destroyed an entire pack of carbon fiber bikes.
what a numpty
Karen…
Should be done for GBH complete twerk
That's attempted murder.
Stupid girl, if you want to be on camera you need to go somewhere else. Should get a big fine for this!
CLOUT
She needs to be banned for life from all UCI events and give her a hefty fine. Selfish woman who endangered lives
Ahahaha gg ez
the mother of idiots is always pregnant
I've just sent link to this video to my son, as  definition of an 'idiot'. I've made a mistake. It's an imbecile.
Lmao this was great, hoping for a bunch more of these during the rest of the tour
Woman. Not surprised
Some people said he could've just avoid the fan holding a sign who's focusing at the cam, can i ask you how? The space provided was just enough for him and his bike, avoiding it leaning back to the competitors position will just cause same thing, even worst, that kind of minds are just dumb as the fan.
Absolute idiot. She wasn't even watching the race, just there for the photo opportunity and social media validation.
that fake fan needs to be prosecuted
Organizers should have organized it properly why risk this happening. They cant sue her tho...
Steve Urkel moment, "Did I do that?"
One idiot born everyday. They should build a fence in those tight or crowded area.
Shes getting sued https://sports.inquirer.net/427084/spectator-to-be-sued-after-tour-de-france-crash . Hope it will cost her a fortune.
What else
in Europe they also have karens that cause tragedies
I think the sign said BLM so it's ok.
She is ninja
Well at least the riders' socks are the exact right length. Good job organisers. Not to worry about sports event basics, like keeping people out from under the competitors wheels and all that nonsense
Hahah, that brightened up my Sunday .... damn road rats
This is for every cyclist that has pissed off vehicle driver's
Some people are too dumb to understand the difference between "fame" and "infamy".
Jail time
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA TOUR DE FUCKED!
Hahahahhahha
La reine des connes !! The queen of Idiots!!!
yeah! 🔥
This is the crash caused by Chick Hicks in Cars all over again
It's disgusting she's facing a year in prison. She's hardly a criminal. They shouldn't allow fans to even be that close. There should be proper barricades. This is the organiser's fault.
social media to important!
HARRY TARDATA
All you guys are muppets! Nobody should be sued and nobody should have looked out for it! Forget this even happened. The health and saftey is already compromised by the organiser not putting in fixed bounderies! No don't be a muppet again and start thinking about boundaries across france. Use some common sense and have fixed rules in pace on how many meters people have to be from the pathway of the bikers! Security should be in popular zones spectators stand (start, end and other famous spots in between). After that you can say they done they best they cud do and now catch the lil fuqur who caused this. At this point organisers are stupid!
Bicycling's most hated fan.
There is always that idiot who ruins it
She should never have been there. But why he crashed because of simply hitting a woman's arm?
馬鹿だな
STRIKE
“Kramer!!!!!”
That woman is a disgusting, deplorable and a poor excuse for a human being. I really hope that she get named, shamed and charged to the full extent of the law.
None of the commenters here have ever made a mistake. Yes, she did a stupid thing and caused a very dangerous crash but her mistake will also probably ruin her life. How many times have we driven way too fast around a corner or done something that could have caused injury or death to someone else, only by sheer luck it didn't happen? I know I've been lucky not to have created a calamity many times. Her luck ran out today. It appears she was sending a message to her father/grandfather and we don't know the back story. Perhaps she's just lost family members to COVID and was trying to send some cheer. I reckon we should take a step back and have a few breaths before we sanctimoniously commit her to hell. Unless you've never made a mistake of course... :-) Cheers and take it easy - Dave
It’s the fact that she ran off that keeps sending me !! She’s all over the uk news today looooooooool poor Tony Martin could’ve been seriously hurt
This could have been so easily avoided if only they had bells on their bicycles. Surely bells on bikes is a legal requirement.
Lol
braindamage
Co za idiotka !!(
😂😂😂
The Fans of this sport who interfere with the racers trackside really fucking piss me off, it’s dangerous behaviour
Classic..🤣😂🤣
Yall calling the fan stupid but aren't there normally fences and it wasn't the only fan that was so close to the bikers? Where are the security measures? I mean yeah the fan did wrong but how did she get so Close with a big sign that whole time
死刑で良き
I’m curious on what the sign said
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAH
Without camera´s she wouldn´t be there, so i wish she get a big punishment. Sport is for real fans, not for show off.
Love her, she's awesome.
The thing that really pisses me off is that she won't suffer any legal consequences. Instead they should have dragged her to court and sentenced her to pay damages to cyclists and bicycles. Only by using an iron fist can the increasingly idiotic behavior of spectators be discouraged.
Idiota
Stupid fan.  Did he/she get fined/sued for damages?
Good job, well done. She helps to fight COVID.
Typical of people these days. Obsessed about being seen more than seeing the sport.
Spatial reasoning
Doesn't get much more stupid
Qu elle enflure
@0:48 auweia :D
It's disgusting how people won't stop doing dumb stuff just to get a little attention.
COPPA COBRAM
HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA     AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆😆
Death penalty for that stupid green bit...
Bloody disgrace :( All that training and hard work ruined by one idiot! Well she wanted to be on camera...NOW SHE IS! I hope they find her!
What did the sign say?
Quelle connasse!
UDAPOTA ANG LINTE KA NA BABAYI GAGA GAGA MO UDAPOTA KAG TUNGA MANGO² SIMO GAGA GAGA GD YA SIMO GAGA
Being a woman she'd probably get a free pass!
Hahahahahaha a sign can bring down the entire event.   Time to rethink a few things of you are the organizers.
You had one Job 😂
THIS should be the catalyst.....  To NOT allow people near riders...
Didnt the officials talk about this and tried to make tdf safer?
Woman 🍷🍷🍷
한국분들 있으시면 보세용… 저 여자가 팻말에 든 말은 “할아버지 할머니 힘내세요 “ 라네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 자기 할아버지랑 할머니께 한말같은데 족히 100대는 넘어졌는데 몇십억은 넘게들고 대출을 받아도 징역일거예요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
extreme stupid fan ..... please tell me u havent children
WANTED‼️
Nonsense. It was Covid.
와 진짜 저거 개새끼다
And it will dissuade other idiots from risking riders, when this person gets taken to court and is forced to pay *all* costs and damages (medical, equipment, administrative, etc) - and it is published.    Respectfully watching the race, even being very animated is totally fine, but seeing people turn up and try to get attention for themselves with the media/TV is abhorrent.  Real fans on the roadside should give them hell and shame them into behaving or they can leave the arena.
ive been saying this for years....spectators in cycling and rallying are way too cheeky and there's been lots of near misses. there should be a barrier of some sort. maximum punishment to this foolish woman.
핵 미친X
She’s lucky it’s not an f1 race.
I laughed as fuck. My dreams come true. Next time i engage this hero for the streets that i usually travel
あかんやろ
All spectator should be banned at least for one stage...
Ptdr on dit merci qui
What an arsehole! These guys train for years to be in the tour to have some dick with a sign to end your tour ,hope they got a hold of them!
The riders should file legal charges against the fan for damages.
I just don't know why this sport keeps going as it is.
Could riders in future "take out" such spectators to prevent mayhem and injuries behind them?    I notice that the idiot placard holder was merely spun around (and did not even fall over), which compared to the injuries and damage caused is completely asymmetrical.  Better the first rider ride lean into the impact, rather than try to avoid them (which was impossible here) which means they may end up in the grass as well, but better 1 spectator down (in this instance) than 30 riders down.
If you look closely it wasn't the sign.  Her arm was extended so much it hit the rider.  Blunt force
Honestly, that person who was holding the sign should be fined and jailed.
Give her the medal
Multi kill
Give her a medal!!
She deserves a medal💪💪
Ofc it was a woman
He should have bunny hopped over the spectator...totally cyclists fault
Wie bescheuert kann man (Frau) eigentlich sein. Und alles für den zwei Sekundenfame...und naklar danach Lapaloma pfeifen und abhauen...watt ne fiese Charakter...
fuck i haven't laughed that hard in a while, perfect absurdity. stupid thing to do but it was an accident
This person with the placard is absolutely not a fan of cycling.
最悪な事故だわ
the spectator was probably doping in the game and not only with the drivers
これは酷い
I think i now have my halloween costume for this year 😂
Lol

Whats actually she write? Can anyone tell me?
Anybody know what happen to the idiot fan after the crash?
Needs restrictions for spectators . Crazy how they are allowed to get this close .
What does the sign say?
カメラに映り込もうとしたアホが原因で大事故になった。これは訴えていいレベル。
Who's she?
Jail for her!
Shame on her. Moreover, she escaped...what a coward
someone chuck that fan into the river.
domino day 2021
What a fkng prat
She has the power to stop the tank.
I never seen anything like this.
a message to her grandparents? i think this might be a waste of A+++ advertising space
ahahah génial
Omi and opi must be very proud now🤬
I hope she gets canceled
Sorted out by natural selection. Sue that stupid human
Now try that on a 80s Groupe B stage 😅
Well … gung-go to the organizers for allowing spectators so close to the edge of the road! Lesson learnt? 🤔
Spectator who caused the accident is to be suede.
GJ. Now you make history.
Thats what happens when you dont have Barriers in place!!
Organiser : We will look for you, we will find you and we will sue you until you dry... Idiot fan: Grandpa, Grandma...help...
Stupid signager
It's some form of Elvish- I can't read it.
Quelle conne elle va faire de la cabane
If more of this happened, i'd probably watch tour de france tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️🤣
Prison!!!!
Women.... XD
The most entertaining thing to ever happen in any bike race ever 😆
Wie dumm kann man eigentlich sein?
You can’t hold a person responsible if the person identifies as a sign.
Wenn du einen Franzosen im Team hast:
Why the hell aren't there boundaries..
Really..She was run away??  Dude....
She is still at large, they are trying to find and sue her. Only a matter of time till she will get hers.
😂😂😂
So glad that she can post the successful two seconds on her Social Media channel
Idiot i hope she will be banned for life!
Things will change after this. They are going to call it the anti-dumbass rule.
It was just an accident. She didn't mean to hurt anyone. She doesn't deserves all that hate. How may of us got distracted on the road once or twice and avoid an accident just by chance. And yes it sucks for the cyclist but they will survive. There is always next year. I mean reading some comments you would think she is the most horrible human being that ever existed. Sports and accidents go together that a fact.
She is being sued by the organizers. Rightfully so
alright is everyone done repeating the same comment now? she definitly did not have the intention to cause this crash yes they did something stupid and yes they should at least pay for the damage but stop mocking them. they probably feel bad already yall dont have to be such jerks
2:01 that Narcissistic personality disorder of a fan who only wants oneself glory is absolutely a shame
“welp... there go’s my peleton”
stupidity at the highest level
2:22 ひどい観客だな!!!
The effects of narcissism visualised.
xd
Encore des idiots et des idiotes irresponsables qui gâchent la fête. il y a toujours une brebis galeuse dans le troupeau. il y a une plainte contre elle et c'est justifié, cela aurait ou aura de graves conséquences.
That fan deserves 50 years of prison ! ;D
It all went downhill from there
Strike dude nice
They have the worst fans sometimes around the world...
she did absolutly everything right. This crash was more entertainement than an entire tour of cycling
Здоровья всем пострадавшим!
Sue her idiot
Physical distancing
Elle voulait se montrer. C'est fait!!!!
Quelle conne...
How to be that incompetent
Has this individual been identified yet?
Good thing she did at least we got a laugh at this boring sport. Big deal they fell get up and continue if you are a man,those losers just want to blame the crash because they knew they would lose
This lady should get sued.
Is (s)he  arreseted yet ?
this guy gets sued the hell out of him lmao
I hope she ready for whatever karma that is coming her way.
黄色い人最悪だな
これはさすがに悪質やわ
Leave it to a woman to f everything up lol
Anyone know what the repercussions of this fan’s actions was?
Accident or not that fan should be banned forever. It’s common sense to not hold a sign out where riders will pass. The same reason we don’t stick our head out when the trains coming
It’s an accident stop being so dramatic ,but she shouldn’t have stood on the road where the cyclists are riding.
GIVE HER A BREAK! She just wanted to have a nice picture taken for her instagram! :)
Lance would’ve jumped her and landed at finish line 💉
This is why they shouldn't have been so quick to resume gatherings lol
I told my buddy some dumb b!tch did that.. then I rewatched it.. i told him nah man, i was some dude.. now everybody here is talking about "her"    What is it now?
In jail !!!
Omi und Opi sind sicher stolz 😅
Connasse 4eme Dan.
She is currently wanted by the police !
T is net een mierenhoop zo van bovenaf gezien
경기를 망친 댓가를  법적고소당해서 비싸게 치루게될 정신나간 관중이네
Lmao that was cool and hilarious. Great work from the spectator
どこの国にもいるなぁ
omg
The spectator is not to be blamed. There are other spectators that are lined all along the sides of the road. Where are the barriers on the sides of the road. There are none. The organisers are responsible to ensure the safety of the riders as well as the spectators. I bet the organisers are not doing the work as they should be. What will have happened if an animal has crossed the road.
The hero we needed
Wow,typical Karen. Just imagine being responsible for this
nice hit!
Le Tour de France a porté plainte contre cette femme.
楽しそう
Jail time...
Put up a damn fence or something.  So stupid
They should have regulations for the spectators, not the super tuck...
Ahaha strike!
I mean .. what do you expect from a woman
Why did she do it? Is she from Ukraine?
0:48 犯人のアホ面腹立つな
plot twist: she was hired by the riders in the front to perform this
She probably wanted an apology after too 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Women.
Hope she at least felt bad for that.
看板を持ってた人を訴えるらしいですね
Lol she’s about to receive a wave of online hate
les français sont stupides 🤣🤣🤣
Oh my, what an idiot.
Les gens sont de plus en plus con ma parole ! 🤬      🐑  🐑
Just one day without a reason why humanity is a complete failure
Eejet
Die sind alle gedopt. Die coms hier, sind lächerlich. Jeder, der glaubt, die trainieren hart, haben ein Problem mit ihrer Wahrnehmung.  Oooh Dear...
anyone know the condition of the first rider? He looks hurt so bad
Well they gotta arrest him
prosecute that moronic fan. such a 101% idiot. is she paid to cause severe damages on the peloton?
C'est partie pour un tour de France 🇫🇷
Go Girl!
Surely he could’ve just powered through a cardboard sign
Wtf is she doing?
How does this race, for as big and well known around the world, not bother to at least put up plastic tape to separate the spectators from the road?  Why are spectators even allowed to get that close to the bikers?  Those bikes go at very high speeds, a collision with a spectator would end badly for both the rider and spectator.
why the HELL aren’t those lines cordoned off??? letting them anywhere near the road is just asking for something like this to happen
何のメッセージかは分からんけれど、これは手前勝手と云わざるを得ない。運営側の警備にも問題があったのかもね。とは言え、観客と選手の距離感の近さが伝統なのだろうし...とても不運な出来事。
Maybe that fan is good in Bowling
Very stupid
Looks like someone was taking a photo for her from the other side. This is an totally idiotic and selfish act.
Una criminale.
her face says it all. too bad she was not hit by Peloton 🤣
Am sure she truly feels bad enough.  Why not some ropes to keep people far enough away from cyclists so it won't happen again.  The first time she was at such a race?
The fuck is everyone’s problem here? It’s an honest mistake. There was no way she would’ve anticipated that she was too close. Don’t act all high and mighty like you’ve never made a clumsy mistake before. She was just a fan trying to show her support. She was only slightly closer than anyone else. It’s not like she ran on the middle of the track. When my Dad saw this he said “I actually feel really sorry for her.” Get a life you freaking antisocial losers.
😂😂😂 Beautifull is it a stock bike?
See in the us we expect people to be stupid. We rope shit off so the only thing we have to worry about are live rounds. Take notes France
In the news, Tour de France are going to sue the spectator with the sign.. It could turn out to be an expensive sign!
at 0:48 the definition of an idiot
これは酷過ぎる… 犯人はレースを見る気も応援する気もない。 早く捕まって損害全てを賠償するべき！
Every time I watch the tour there were some 'fans' doing dangerous things,  they're literally murdering.
Moron fan!
It takes only 1 attention-seeking person.
They should sue her for all damaged bikes, damage to health. Otherwise it will never end. Human stupidity has no limits. Online life is more important than normal life.
ナスカーみたい
Some Idiot fans around this sport. Im surprised it dosnt happen every day.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If the tour set up fences.. there wouldn't have been an accident.
And that person walks away….. no punishment. Free to do it again & again & again & again.
Omi omi
You hope people are respecting the event and make good decisions about where to stand instead of putting up barriers. I mean what do you expect every year? This has happened for about 100 years of Tour de France.
Put that woman on jail
That "fan" needs to be named and shamed. How ridiculous
Why do they have fans right beside the roads for ?
Send all medical bills to her
Well that's annoying...what the hell is wrong with her🤣
Allez opi omi 😄
J’adore
She should be punished.  She has to pay for all the damage.
Why is there no tape ? Why is it so easy for spectators to run in their way? This is 100% TdF organizers' fault.
What is this quality??? Are we in 2008? Embarrassing.
shame on you All Germans should apologize
This happens when some "fan" lacks attention 🙄 annoying. Just bec one fan lacks attention, 100 cyclists wasted their months of training.
段ボール黄色ネキ人生終わりもんやろ
"allez opi-omi" ???
At least her 25 cats will be at home waiting for her
HAHAHAHAHA EPIC
They should have stopped the race
She/He is not fan just criminal
The is going to change how spectators watch live.  Because of this ladies stupidity, TDF is going to have a shit load of rules and regulations for fans .
More security and safety would make sense
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:48 вот
good job
Boufonne
Ohhh man.  That’s so messed up smh
Bisogna cominciare a denunciarli e perseguirli penalmente addossandoli tutti i costi di cure mediche e degli sponsor, ridurli in lastrico a vita.
Surprised blm havnt tried this shit
She should be jailed so many people got hurt from this
그녀는 어떻게 되었습니까?
Per la STUPIDITÀ di una persona!!!!!!!
take her in jail
And she just runs away. What a coward.
I cheer for the chadette
Che inseminia!
Must be a Truck driver

26日に開幕したツール・ド・フランス（2021 Tour de France）で、大クラッシュが発生したことを受け、大会主催者はクラッシュの原因をつくった沿道の女性観客を訴える意向を示した。
Is that person arrested and charged with all the medical bills and bike damage?
on the other hand, can't see there are any members of orginizing team around, am I correct?
She need to pay for all the losses and injuries cost for all cyclists!!!
完全に道に入ってきてるしプラカード🪧が長いし 🚴‍♀️自転車を見ていない。
So angry!!!! 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
"Pretty women make us buy beer. Ugly women make us drink beer"  Im drinking my beer right now
クソでしかないな
Question: what would be the penalty if the rider that was hit turned into her and off the road instead? Tackle some oblivious bint, save the peloton.
I heard they are going to take legal action and sue her
Putting lives and careers at risk for a photo opportunity. Shocking how stupid some people are.
She doing gods work
Ozzy should narrate this
Quelle conne!!!
ALLEZ OPI-OMIL
Spectator pose for a photo, too excited not knowing the consequences of her action
STUPID fans!!!!!
😡😡😡😡😡
0:47 A stupid boy is here.
Girls ah.. 😂😂😂😂
これはひどい、まじ最悪な観客。頭おかしい。
A fan? Very good reason to re introduce La Guillottine.
Lè Idiot.
These stupid fans posing for the camera, should be arrested and made to pay heavy penalty for the losses suffered by all the contestants.
この女、許せんな
The staffs are stupid for allowing spectators stand so close
Please name and shame her
She isn't watching the action - just posing for a social media moment going "HEY LOOK AT ME" -= she is going to be sued over this and I have no problem with the organizers doing it, to be make sure no more fools make this massive mistake in the future.
The idiot who almost made Fortunato fell dowm on the Zoncolan climb at the giro came out and apologized and to avoid a sue some federetion guys asked him to take part to some volunteering/charities cycling events. But I guess here the damage is quite worse..
I would not call "a fan" a person looking away from the riders.
I’ve seen shit saying “should have avoided the spectator”. BRO. HOW? Peloton to the left and more fans to the right?
go on reveal her personal details. let the whole world judge her
She should be charged a huge fine 👿
Disgusting
この女訴えられるらしいなw  ご愁傷様w
プラカードの意味を教えてください。
What a sad thing! She should be prosecuted
That was no fan who did that.. If she had been, she would have respected the bikers and stood at a distance. She should face a huge fine for this and a ban from being a spectator.
opi omi what mean
Why is this so easy to ruin in the first place, I don’t watch this sport but common sense tells me out of those people there’s has to be the one crackhead.
She deserves to be in a prison for 10+ years
This fan should be jailed
Wonder if Martin got to her to shake her thoroughly or if she escaped?
Holy fuck, I wouldn't step out of my house for a few years out of sheer embarrassment.
What will happen to that lady who caused the issue?
I hope she will be arrested.
She deserves to sit one year in a romanian jail
Look intonthe direction from where the drivers come. Not the Other side!
やっちまったなぁ
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is so funny
日本語求む  この女性の掲げている文字の意味が知りたいです
Lol
https://youtu.be/PGB4OjyNMB4
Sooo SATISFYING!!!!
Get WREKD BOI
This is worse than Larry David tripping Shaq.
Hope the spectator got kicked out.
これへ酷い！ 主宰者は訴えるというが、仕方ないレベルだ！
Cycling has fans??? 😅
Finally something to make cycling exciting. You should have more random shit pop up in front of them to deal with.
Easy solution, ban spectators 🤣
Idiot
When I see this kind of idiots, I feel better about myself.
Too bad it wasn't a car that was racing past her.
Am I the only one that thinks this is funny? My stomach hurts a lot from laughingZ
The Sign O' the Times!
Clipples well safe
Great social distancing there Cletuses
選手見ないで何してるんだか。メッセージ相手の祖父母が身元を教えてくれるのを願う。選手は一生懸命準備してきただろうに、かわいそうすぎる。
That's hilarious.
Opi and Omi will be ecstatic! They will help pay all the settlement. Now their retirement fund will go a long way.
News info : Apparently she is a german woman and she run away just after .. and disappear. The police could not find her.
ブレーキ付けよう
I tried to make a psychological report of this monstrosity called simply woman.  He is a person lacking self-confidence, with many failures in life.  She has always suffered because of her character with big problems. It is very possible that her gesture is voluntary, the authorities must ban her from all sports competitions because she could scale with these wild attitudes.
Jail time needed
台無しにするな
Must be another Loki variant who wanted to cause a crash this time.
What did the sign say?
What a stupid fan!😡
Did anyone chase after her, beat her or drag her back to be dealt with by the bikers and spectators? Wtf. She needs to be charged with sabotage of a race.
It's a hard knock life
get that person arrested now
How could anyone be so utterly thick and stupid as to hold out a sign ? Spectators need to keep WELL away from the road. Hope she is sued. Selfish stupid fool. Not even watching the direction of the Riders! Unreal.
I wish she had to personally pay for all the equipment damage she caused, and face charges for the injuries she alone is responsible for by her reckless behaviour
There are just such stupid people over and over again.🤦🏼‍♂️
I just want to know what the sign said
Women...
Espèce de connasse.  Voilà ! C'est ça un plouc.
Эту бабу походу казнили потом
考えられへんぞ！
" oh he was ok , until he was hit by a bicycle , a lot of bicycles , rest in peace France bicycle proud " punch of French ppl got spanked by a sign !
選手が心配です。
Idiot of the year. Months and months of training ruined by this stupid, egoistic human being.
Stupid non-fan
this is a chance !
As René would say: “You stupid woman!”
Maybe next time the spectator can try this at a formula 1 race. One thing is for sure, the spectator will come out of hiding when money is offered for the story.
When we see how the first rider who fell hit his head… thankfully he was wearing a helmet
After seeing so many stupid accidents in professional cycling where drivers just slip because of wet roads or because a corner was too narrow, I am convinced by now that they can't actually ride a bicycle. They can only ride under perfect conditions in the comfort of their loving rooms. It's the same with other sport too: why are skiing contests aborted in bad weather, where normal people would still easily make it? This elitism of the athletes and snowflakey behavior makes these events boring and borderline unwatchable.
You've got 2 things to do as a cyclist. 1. Pedal, 2. Look where you're going. To think that guy's a "professional"
Thats what happens when u let liberal woke feminist they/there 🤣  watch sports live
馬鹿1人で世界は破滅させられるいい例
She is being sued by the TDF organizers and rightly so, she was clearly there with the sole intention of getting on tv with no real understanding of the cycling race itself!
It is really sad to see this. One single person's ignorant behavior made so many riders injured and also ruined their career. I wish that person is punished (or at least fined).
let's find her
Fool...
Karen strikes again...
これはやばいな
Hey y’all #Trump2024🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 We need to take back our country from the socialists. Get involved and volunteer to make sure the GOP gains power!! #F***SenileBiden✊
It is horrible, but I think it is uncontrollable, and U cannot expect to have a police person on duty to manage these members of the public. Tracing them through camera footage is going to be costly. Not sure if it was intentional either, but, a big, costly, painfull mistake. The organization should plan to have these end of stage parts of the race re-located to wider roads. Even the support cars / motor bikes tend to endanger the riders at times . Cameras can be used to proof a point, good or bad.  Public Swarf is a problem.
What if someone died?  stupidity is infinite….
3rd world!
LMAO WHAT A LEGEND!👍 THAT FIRST MORON GOT "HIS" SHIT ROCKED! LINE EM UP KNOCKE EM DOWN. I HATE BIKERS HAHAHA
I don’t understand why professional sports keep letting fans get so close to the athletes?
Lol.  Hahahahahahahaha!
She must be sent to Saudi Arabia for punishment!
Ce genre de vidéo me fait clairement perdre foi en l'humanité.
she is an idiot of course but i've always wondered why spectators are allowed to get that close to racers
Why are the spectators so close? Also, this isn't the first Tour de France, why don't they have a rope or something to keep the fans a few feet back?  Some people really lack common sense and need others to think for them, the rope might deter them from doing something so dumb in the future.  Geez.... What if a child had been in the front and gotten mowed down by the crashing riders??
That poor lady had her sign destroyed by that stupid cyclist. I hope she wasn't hurt the cyclist was travelling way too fast.
Narcissism takes more victims 🤩🤩🤩
2021 man what do you expect 🤦‍♂️
Is it true that that fan is now sleeping with the snails
Loooooooool
Really Hate this kind of idiots. what a junk of society
I hope she will be next month at Pamplona for the running of the bulls.
How has this not happened before?  They let people get that close is unbelievable lack of planning. Organizers fault 💯!
this will continue to happen unless extremely harsh punishments are legally introduced
0:49 here comes the jerk!
Bet she's a tiktoker
How is it possible!!! A stupid spectator can cause a really disaster!!!
That is sooo funny 😄  More of that please  That’s the best thing about these races , watch it just to see big crashes like that , Thumbs up 👍 for the guy that’s holding the sign. He should be attending more races , good job buddy.
lol this is hilarious, at least we get some entertainment out of this mind numbingly boring cyclist crap!
Best punishment for that woman: make her hold sign at the same position at the next WRC
What did the sign say?
what a legend! FUCK CYCLISTS!!!
He should be arrested
Wasn’t a fan. But a selfish fool that has no concern for anyone. Need for some safety people at these events. A not signs.
apparently the fans sign said something along the lines of "go grandma and grandpa". And the race organisers want to sue and now she is in hiding
opi and omi could be mad
Ahh, I just love seeing people on bikes eat shit
arrest her
Let's give him a ticket to the most important car race too Who knows...
His action was as stupid as his face and gesture, quite a set indeed!
This PoS falls upwards I’m sure.
She should get slapped in the face for every rider that fell because of her stupidity.
My god. That damn women
Terrible more than expected. she disturbed perfectly
Just sue her ass!!!
Xdddd
The TdF's "Steve Bartman" moment
She is noob player in life.
Omg this is so sad
OMG
Opi and omi should have thought about abortion
alle (medische) kosten verhalen op die vrouw
wat een paardekut
日本じゃレース開催者の責任が問われるが、フランスでは邪魔した観客が悪くなるんですねー
It's as if he/she meant it to happen 🤷👍🚴
The person looks almost fake, like a copy n paste edit kind of thing. No emotion coming from the prop, why would you be looking the opposite way, Oh yea! Ticktok🤌🏼 Have to add in, the very last rider to make it out of the pileup is extremely lucky. 😅
He should kick her out before crushing
自転車競技の醍醐味ではあるが、観客の場所を変更しなければいけない。がんばってきた選手に対して敬意を持たなければいけない。観客が主役になろうとするのはおかしい。
これはひどい。 客のモラルの低下は世界中で起きてる。
Co za matoł!🤦
The Fault Belongs To The Idiot Sign Holder.                                                        😲😱 poor bikers🚵‍♀️🚴‍♀️.🚴‍♀️ 🚴‍♂️ 😥 6/26/21
Stupid fan👎👎👎
Hopefully the Grandparents get her to turn herself in for her stupidity.
Here's your sign!
It's also partly the organizers of this race fault. Don't allow people on or that close to the course.
She’s a menace to society lmao.
Or the roads are at least protected with safety yellow lining ropes or it has to stop with those spectators and crazy fans along side the roads. Even better is to put up some stages in each village the riders pass and there the spectators can stand/sit and cheer.  I hope there will be decent action now and that woman will be charged.
このオバハン逃げ切れるかな？
I am sure that this person is mortified by this turn of events, and I think that is punishment enough. We are human and we all make mistakes, that's why they put rubbers on the end of pencils right?
What a fucking Karen!
perhaps a legal penalty/fine for any damage caused would be enough to dissuade these kinds of people to perform these reckless stunts/actions
Once the governing body of professional cycling, the 'UCI' decided to "crack down" on Performance Enhancing Drugs the sport's fate was sealed. Virtually all professional athletes around the globe use PED's in one form or another, and yet, focus was applied to Cycling; which happens to be the Whitest sport. Hatred in the form of sabotage and life-threatening attack have appeared during the Tour de France
It’s Sabotage not a fan…..
完全に余所見してんじゃん、このババァ  大会主催者も立ち入り禁止区域設けてないから、こっちにも落ち度はあるよな
How dare you bully this poor woman you misogynist commenters. There were too many bikes, they were bunched, accident waiting to happen #stoptheabuse
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Opi and omi should've thought about swallowing that night. Now look.
Lmao
I just hope the people who felt down the road were ok. Someone mentioned he could have avoided the accident, did you even see on his right side were the fans and the grasses, on his left side was another rider, and behind him was another rider. So he couldn’t move to left or right or even slow down. I expect there were lots of cheering noises from the fans so even if he saw it earlier there was no way he could’ve avoided the crash. 100% that lady’s fault. Her stupidity ruined the competition
was that Steve Bartmans sister  holding the sign ?
Stupid fan😡 ... ruins dreams of hard work to win this race ...just disrespectful
A stupid Fans trying to show off bulshit
Lol o g
This is the funniest thing I have ever seen.
Well she's famous now...
... and the winner of the 2021 Stupidest Fan is the sign carrying spectator.
She deserves jail time
0:47 　あ～あ
Un vrai connard !
Why are people defending her? Are people seriously white knighting here as well!? What's with all the "she didn't mean it" crap?  Her reckless behaviour caused hundreds of thousands dollars worth in damages, and 4 athletes to pull out from the race. Also, she ran away from the scene immediately. There has to be consequences for your actions.  Ignorance is not the same as innocence.
The where's Waldo shirt under her coat is a bit ironic. In the way. SMH.
This happens every year they need to have borders cause fans do stupid shit
LMAO it's like bowling
Hope they put that idiot in prison
Women
I've never wished I was at a bike race before seeing this.
Great crash. I love it! She knew what she was doing and we thank her 💗
Any update of this girl? Did they find and sue her?
I thought pelaton was an expensive white people workout machine...
Stupid cycling fan wannabe
very irresponsible that stupid woman must have a good fine and go to prison
Pure Stupidity
She was standing on the grass, the cyclist was also at fault. Part of the skill is anticipating poor spectator skills.
Bikes are lame anyway
しゅごい
Attempted manslaughter.
Pasu
For sure the guy on the side is a complete moron, and there isn't a punishment suitable enough for this jackhole, but . . . ha ha ha ha.
Was the sign worth the trouble it cost 😂
What idiot
OMG my dad called me to ask about this as I watched this video lol. And btw I know you didn’t ask but I wanted to share. Okay thank you!   Edit: This should be a meme in under 10 days.
Oh well. Who gives a shit. I'd rather watch flies fuck.
What do you expect when you tailgate?
Is this a race or a place for idiots to take pictures?
What a waste of steroids
ih ope this happens again
As a mountain biker I'm surprised the rider couldn't push through it.
出入禁止
Son caduti come dei salami 😂😂😂😂
What did the sign say?
I'm not familiar with French laws.  Are you allowed to beat a fan to death with your bike?
Quelle conne. Les gens... Le vrai virus de notre monde.
Sign should have said “I’m a dumbass.”  I hope they sue her. These poor guys trained so hard and so long for this. Hopefully something is done about spectators being so close to avoid this from happening again.
It was the guy wearing yellow at .34 waving the flag.
HI GRANDMA AND GRANDPA, IM THE BIGGEST LAUGHING STOCK OF THE INTERNET IN ABOUT 1 WEEK
Umm…….my bad
No se puede ser tan pelotuda, y despues quieren gobernar el mundo las minas....
was she arrested?
Seems like the organizers responsibility to keep the track clear , it's dangerous like world rally was except the cyclists are the victims. They need to keep people out of the road
0:49 what an idiot
0:34 that woman ruined ithad her arm out the whole time 🤬
0:32 it was that stupid idiot at the top with his arm out, the highest yellow clothing
O que aconteceu com o cara da placa kkkkkkkkkk?
The guy that was hit with the sign literally slammed his head into the ground. Hope she’s punished.
Look at 0:50 not watching the peloton posing for the camera …. Camera person should have that full picture
remember when the parachutist landed in the boxing ring when Riddick Bowe v Evander Holyfield and the crowd beat the crap out of him AND he was arrested? I wish fans at the Tour would send a strong message to fans who do stupid things like this so that future idiots don't repeat the same stupidity.
She now gonna use the female card. Saying women aren't in the sport lmao
Stupidity of a fan........🤦🏻‍♂️😡
"Did I do that?" Steve Erkel
Not so sure this was not a fan. A fan would have been looking at the bikes. This was some kind of protestors trying to get a message out? Anyone knows what the sign said?
Fucking hilarious!!
Every team should sue her for the damage to their equipment. NEGLIGENCE!
I want to see her name made public
She is famous for being an absolute idiot now, opposite effect of what she tried to achieve.  I suppose they should put tape or barriers at the start from now on,
I hope the players are not seriously injured.
It's the most entertaing thing of the tour.
And we wonder why the world has rules. Because rules control the stupid.
Why couldn't it have been a motorbike...
This is hilarious
These idiots have been quarantined for a year and can't adapt outside the house anymore. Get the hell out the way!
The fan should be sued and pay for the physical injuries.
Now the peleton will have to sing a song called "get the fuck outta the way"  for the rest of the tour.🤬
She needs to pay for this what an idiot
What a moron! Will find a way to make it about themselves I'm sure....
Is it shit?
That's attempted murder in at least 50 cases, right? I hope the death penalty is still a thing in France.
I bet her brain is made by egg noodle or used as an accessory.
ada juga jenis perancis bodo...
blame the UCI for not placing barriers
The me me me social media generation🤦‍♂
Who said one person can't make a difference?
Lol this bits run a way
Should make the yellow mountain graphic at the bottom of the screen larger - I can hardly see it.
와 저 쌍뇬 ㄷㄷㄷ
however she was lucky
Done on purpose
French and Spanish fans are fucking worst...
she should be given jail time
Wow that broad with the sign was too busy getting in the scene with the bikers and she didn't use her frickin brain!!!! Whatya know
The stupid fan causing the crash on man hunt now... ..
Look at the Roglic crash. I hope his shoulder is ok.
That action will probably have consequences for future races. It is nice to see that some idiotic fan will ruin the fun of both the fans and the cyclists. Is it really that hard to control this kind of childish behavior?
Godo
We know that some fans are just as stupid as this. Event coordinator should've anticipated this and implied more strict policy
Causes an accident that results in dozens of men getting hurt, in some cases flushing years of training and dreams of these athletes down the drain because she thinks her own publicity is more important than everyone else around her, then runs off to avoid responsibility..... What you have here is your standard 21st century woman.
Yeah... it's always someone else's fault :)
A true narcissistic idiot
She should be arrested and banned for life for any sport events.
I wonder how much she would have to pay
egocentric and failed
I wish she would do this on the expressway in rush hour traffic. Some truck would make her a speed bump...
Ban this sport all together. Roads are for cars period.
This is the best thing I’ve seen this year! Cyclists are arrogant scum
Selfish...."it's all about me"
This throws the whole tour out
ban that clown
Oh man, I wouldn't want to be that guy now... 😂
INB4 all the “Curb Your” memes.
Obviously not interested in the race at all, only in their 5 seconds of fame. I hope they sue that persons ass into oblivion
so irresponsible spectator. look what have you done? It’s just the first day of racing.
You fools are so obsessed with 'revenge' and 'consequences'. Makes me sick how I'm seeing people demand such ridiculous repercussions for this woman. Please explain how punishing her will help the situation? It was an accident. Stupid and completely avoidable, but an accident none the less.
who is she??
So basically all the rider were taken down by a flimsy piece of cardboard made in China, bunch of pussies.
Connasse
This fan will be holding a sign saying homeless after the lawyers are finished with her
Nous étions quelques kilomètres avant, lorsque nous repartions nous avons appris cet accident stupide. Quelle honte ! C'est un des rares sports où on peut y assister gratuitement et d'aussi prêt... Si les gens continuent à être aussi bête en se rapprochant, ils vont finir par interdire les spectateurs. Certaines personnes ne sont venus que pour la caravane et des ados faisaient 👎 aux équipes adverses... Si nous ne leur avions pas dit que ça n'était pas sport, les parents ne disaient rien 😭 C'est la honte, aucun respect !
Domino’s Pizza has the Noid. The Tour de France has:
How ignorant... guess she got her 15 seconds of fame
I want to hear what kind of punishment the legal system cooks up for her. I hope it's brutal.
😂👍🏻
재경기 해야지 이건..
She should be in jail, paid the expenses of all the injured people and banned from assists to watch the competitions live
Go Grandma!
Falling behing on a race is not bad all the time
Fantozzi contro tutti Coppa Cobram😀
Bozo
ive seen a video on youtube called 10 worst ways to torture someone to death. She deserves one of those. haha i allow her even to pick one.
This is women's habit
That persons life is ruined
무개념 관종 관중
That’s what she gets for not having a sign holding license
Thing is if they all had bells on their bicycles they could have..er..stopped and beat the holy crap out of her
Plenty of the bike riders are arses too, back on their bike and keep going without a concern for the injured, just their goal
Fucking sign person didn’t even get hit! They were like a matador with a charging bull!
Fantozzi in bicicletta or mister bean
What did her sign say?
😡💢
They should have her pay for the entire broken bikes.
I hope Tony and Chris are OK.
SMH
I think that was hilarious 🤣😂 This event must be one of the most boring sporting spectacles there is but thanks to that fan for making it much more eventful & entertaining.
In my opinion Organizer fault what other sporting event allows spectators so close
This is a stupid sport and I’m glad that’s being exposed.
Now the woman will hunker down like there is a real pandemic😂
That fan needs a good sock beating
Stupid spectator,!!!!! that person should be punished as well as person taking his picture on the opposite side of the road.
She on her social media: im a victim here, why there are no trans poeple in this competition, i didnt know what i was doing, little break from social media.
Hahaha
Bobo nmn nun spectator na un badtrip 😅😅😅
That was an attempt to advertise omi opi look at the website from omi opi for people working
If its not searching for attention on tiktok then try it on international tv broadcasts. I guess she earned the attention more than she was looking for.
Existen metidas de pata, y después está este tipo.
tiene que ir presa ! (the espectator have to go to prision)
Cyclism or bawling!? Looks like a STRIKE 2 me
Por eso no deberían permitir que los espectadores se acerquen mucho
The mountain passes should cordoned off as fans always create a bottle-neck passage and hinder the athletes. This is where the barricades and officers  are most needed. The fans do not have the right to impede the race and be a source of danger to the riders.
Fine that idiot
What people will  do to get famous!
You're famous! Happy now? Best wishes for Tony and all affected cyclists.
Where is the artist fan, how people do fool things for a picture
Perhaps next time he will look where he's going and use the handlebars to stop hitting spectators.
ce moment la ou tu veux crache sur le visage de cette personne
OMG, hope the sign is all right. Bunch of absolute madmen with the entire width of the road  to go around it (if they actually look where they're going).
Every racer who crashed deseves to beat the shit outta that fan
Bartman is not forgotten...
Another road accident with live stock
Shame, why was spectator sticking out so far with a card board sign @ that? LOL! person can't see the bikes coming? seems spectator wasn't paying attention to the game, unless he/she did on purpose....hmm.
All these stupid racings are just a waste of time.
This is why we can't have nice things
I have never seen such a funny thing 😂😂😂 hahhaha CIAO 👋
i dont think she wouldve wanted a crash, i just think stupid people should not be spectators. what a mess she caused
What happens to that person now? Can actions be taken against that fan?
Stupid spectator not spectating the riders...should´ve stayed at home.
Lmfao
The fan just wanted to play domino 😁
I side with the fan on this one.  She made the Tour de France interesting to non-fans!  She's a hero!
I think the first-hit rider was expecting the person to move. I'm guessing he would've bodied her a bit more if he had more time
This is no fan, this is just some bloke with a stupid sign that caused a massive crash in the race, sue that guy!!!
Police is looking after her right know
Now 3000 € fine. And see how he no longer goes to the races.   Stup|d id|ot.
il ne doit pas être possible de trouver plus bête quelle
That person is no fan of the sport. All they were interested in was getting their idiotic insta moment of facetime on TV. Zero interest in the absolute world's best cyclists gracing their presence. But hey, look at me, me, me and me !!
Why do I feel like I have already seen it?
Worst opening stage to a Tour ever. Sickening moment. The fact the race may have been decided on day 1 by an idiot with a piece of cardboard with total contempt for the race. Can’t believe what I’m watching.
Women...
assault charge needed
what a f... pile of excrement of a person who causes this.   She should be prosecuted and made to pay injuries, damages and compensation to all involved, teams , athletes, sponsors, TV viewers etc.
She should be criminally prosecuted. She is consciously endangering other people’s lives. I’m not saying she did it with intent, however she could have avoided it.
She is the true essens of stupidity🤬🤬🤬
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fans need to start policing themselves
This is 100% on the organizers. If they want to sue someone sue themselves for allowing it to happen.
Oh well lol
How y'all know it's a woman? 😏
She must be in jail. What a stupid woman.
Everyone blaming the spectator. I blame the UCI. Since years the riders say they want more safety. Only thing the UCI is doing is banning some bike positions
The ugliest cardboard sign 🪧👀😡
Its an allegory of Kamala Harris and the United States.
hahah this is the funniest thing I have seen all week, payback for all those cyclists being knobs on the road :-)
that one stupid thing... ( dont want to call it human ). cause so much damage.   there is the damage on the Equipment. but thats "just" money.  but there are so many things which have nothing to do with money.  that person damaged humans health... i dont want to know what happend to the first guy in the front. so many people crashed into him with high speed. so many people will have very bad injuries and maybe unrepairable injuries. and maybe not only outside wounds. maybe inside. thats a horroble moment to cycle with high speed in a big group of people and then you are out of control what happen next. maybe you lose the trust to your talent and equipment and cant continue to cycle in the tour de france.  and that all happend because a f*ckta*d wants to make a selfie on the road...  shame on you. i hope you read this all and feel damn bad about what you did...
fans should be totally off the road even on  climbs  coming off a bike at 60km per hour not fun .2nd crash a fan got smash bad while holding his bike when he was off the road blue top red helmet 3 of 4 riders hit him
Let's be honest though, it was funny to watch. Like a pack of cards.
0:49 Fan's sign causes crash.
That fan has an iq of a walnut
Careless Fan 🤬🤬
Wtf are the spectators allowed to be so close to the bikes! Dumb as fook! Should be barriers 🙄
Allez Opi-Omi. Apparently means 'Go Grandpa-Grandma." That's one way of giving them an advantage. Were they even in the race? Nutcase!
En France, on dit "connasse" !
Why is there absolutely nothing about who this fan is? Where is this fan? What happens to this fan? Why is nobody curious why this fan isn’t being punished? Why is this fan not being hunted down?
She is sued by the organization for this crash.
It was an accident. She played a minor part. Everyone has signs. The riders need to be more vigilant too.
Pretending this is a surprise is willful ignorance on the organizer’s part.  And for that matter the participants: this is not a new phenomenon. The rider should not of hesitated as he simply should’ve powered into it would he have still wrecked? maybe but they did the worst possible thing by hesitating.
This needs to trend ...ever since the race has been on cable and network TV from NBC it has become the super bowl of bike racing on tv. I wonder if nbc will still show the race since nbcsn is shutting down by 2022. They also have it on peacock which is struggling to gain viewers in a crowded streaming sports landscape.
Hahaaa
Should face a criminal charge for reckless endangerment
Kid w/ the Yellow Jacket caused it.
Woman moment
I hope they catch and sue the bejesus out of that moron.   I love watching the Tour but the idiots lining/blocking the way are a disgrace to France's otherwise spectacular display shown to the world.
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in  cryptocurrency
Should be arrested for being a total bell end.
Feminismo en todo su esplendor
Woman and common sense SELDOM collide in the same sentence.
Women and their INSANE desire to be on social media!!!
...wonder how many 'likes' she got ?!!  ;-/
Roba da farla impecorare da tutti quelli che sono caduti!!! 😈
Incredibile. Impossibile correre in queste condizioni
Accidents will always happen
That spectator is an absolute idiot, I hope not many of the riders were injured 😔
Without fans, there would be no Tour.  The riders should have avoided her.
This is why we should put stupid and useless people inside a simulation once the machines take their useless low salary jobs
How bad does it need to get before anyone does anything about it ? How many cyclists need to die ?
Why do I believe she did this on purpose?
OMG!!  All the training, effort, money and time investested by the competitors and this MORON girl flushed it down the toilet. They should sue her 🤦🏻‍♀️
She was clearly stepping out to put her face and sign in the direction of a camera on the other side wanting to be on camera. She's on camera now.
What a sign
UCI reaction - lets ban pedaling out of saddle, cause safety!
She better hire an attorney. She's going to be sued for millions.
Les chiffres de merde qu'ils font sur le tour de france chaque année
Feminist attacks Le Tour peloton. Cuz patriarchy. Reeee🤪
Petite précision: blessure des cycliste (Risque de plainte pour cette fichue personne), vélo à 50 000€ chacuns (j'espère qu'elle a une sacrée assurance)
Biden supporter looking for attention
JAIL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!! 10 YEARS FOR STUPIDITY AND SELFISHNESS
This "Karen" was literally trying to murder all of the cyclists.  The poor sign had no chance, the cyclists should have avoided the sign by plowing into the manipulator of the sign.
Finally excitement!! 👍🏻😂😆
it was not a crash. she wanted this accident.
Nobody: Karen: the cyclist hit me
Jail the fan, They need to make an example of this idiot fan.
John Lennon was also killed by a fan
Tony Martin saif 100 times before the Tour that the organizer has to to something against the fans. Nobody listening to the riders. And thats the result...
“I WANNA BE ON TV SO IM GONNA GET AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE”      🤦‍♂️
That was an advertisement from company idiot look at omi opi site at directors
Society needs to ban stupid people. The problem is to call this an accident. It wasn't.
Entitled Karen!!
It's sad to see that Andy Warhol was right.
Lmaoooo
Signora, lo sa dove se lo deve INFILARE quel cartello? Su per il (ül0
FRAUEN
Bicyclists take a massive L, as they deserve
This is such a bummer. Tony Martin’s face says it all “shit dudes hold on!!!”
Please tell me that they beat her to a pulp
She wanted to be on TV.  Well, she got her wish.  She will now forever be known as the idiot that ruined the Tour de France of 2021 opening stage.
Jeeeez go to hell What an absolute shameful behaviour. Trial please
Can anyone translate ALLEZOPI-OMIL?
Hahahah buttdarts
Gentlemen cyclists, please maintain social distancing
How stupid are you not to know where will they come from?? Why don't they do anything for safety of the riders?? If someone smashes the neck to someone he can get killed because of stupid people with signs and flags etc. Do not allow people to come to the street because they are too stupid to realise how many people can get injured. I would give her a fine to pay so high she would sell everything she had including her house and kids
Think of all the wasted PEDs...
They should let everyone who crashed beat on that entitled prick for 5 minutes each.
When will the Tour de France begin to enforce crowd control?
CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND INTENT. UCI NEEDS TO ENFORCE 2 METERS DISTANCES FROM RACE ROUTE.
Encore une idiote de première...
An Angela Merkels fan she surely must be. U know, one of the feminists, the woke crowd
She wanted a photo...an expensive one
Fans ruin every sport. This is why rally barely ever happens any more. Fucking fans standing too close to the action.
That fan should get his ass kicked
What an absolute C U Next Tuesday. All because they wanted to be noticed.
😱
There is no cure for stupidity
Some drop kick on here  tried 2 make this accident & the UCI ban of the super tuck the same. STUPID COMMENT.
That’s awesome! Hope to see more of this! Make Le Tour better more interesting.
That's not a fan, that's a criminal jail him or her whatever that was
It's a 2,100 mile race. That's 4,200 miles of Barrier required. Not possible. Motorcycle cops with cattle prods is the answer, riding 50 meters ahead of the pelaton.
Women…am I right?
The fan should get ban for life for this!
What a disgrace
Can the UCI & French Government pls lay down some Super Strict Laws 4 Fans watching the TdeF.  Absolute Stupidity that a Fan can bring down 1/2 to 3/4 of the Peleton. Fine €€ this person & jail them. Make an example of them.  It has happened b4.  Haven't the French Fans & others learned anything over the yrs. About this senseless behaviour. .  Tuff 1st Day..   feel 4 the team's & riders..
Is she available to hire?..
Moron. But the tour loves crashes!?
Thought I'd had a bad day. Not anymore.
Well the nuisance sign poser wanted to be popular... Be careful what you wish for...
Selfishness on colossal display.......me , me, me .... IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU!
Ça en dit long sur notre société...
Ban that guy
Uma idiota será sempre uma idiota…
10 years in jail please 🙏
if you pull such a stunt it criminally stupid. a person that stupid is a clear harm for her inviroment & herself. clear reason to lock her up.
u can tell this commentator was genuinely pissed off.
Sums up modern day narcissistic society.
Nooooooooooo fu.k fan  🤦😔🤨
I hope she have to pay for this stupid action
There are people who need a Punch to the face
My candidate for idiot of the year.. Or Idiot of the century??
about time there were fines for anyone but riders impeding the road, no one needs 'fans' on the road, you go to watch and support not to be 'in ' the race.....
Y asi es como demostramos que la gente es estupida
That so called "fan" was not even interested in the race, he/she just wanted to have a camera shot and let the world see his/her face, which is very successful.
This race has become more about the dingbat fans trying to get on camera than the racers. What a shitshow.
I wonder if the person with the board bailed pretty sharpish after that!! 🤥
Jpr. Co za idiotka
I thought the roid rage got to them
female vanity
No social  distance here?
The guy with the sign that caused this is a halfwit.
That was enough to knock a professional cyclist over?
They shoud redo the whole day, start from scratch.  Why don't they police these fans, have a guard rope or something?
" zopi " pim pum pam
Bolsonaro 2022!
Stupidity in a yellow jacket
Вот женщина а
He said it right the stupidity of a spectator!
That's why people wanted spectators back to sports events
The spectator that was holding the sign and caused the accident should be held accountable🥲😡
Questa non deve più stare in strada. È pericolosa
LoL hahaha
ALLEZ OPI-OMI !
That boy/girl has got No Brains they should have to pay for all that. damage and  there medical insurance too
Funny thing is, the spectator fled the scene,..and is now missing...
It is horrible for grandma and grandpa to have such a stupid granddaughter.
Tony Martin (a long time veteran pro) should’ve been able to keep it up, it’s only cardboard. What a shame and a crappy way to start.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This "fan" should pay all the damages🤔
If you listen closely you can hear Luciano Michelini playing in the background.
Does his sign say pay some road tax ?
She should pay for every single broken bike.
Arrest her...after she pays for all the equipment damage she caused
The peasants have grabbed their pitchforks.
you might think that this is a terrible display of narcissistic spectator behaviour, but the truth is that its  the most successful defence against invading forces in the history of France.
ban her for life
Fine that moron $10,000 and throw him in jail for three weeks. This will stop other morons ( well some maybe) from pulling this stupid sh*it
Putain de MERDE!!!!!!! C'est quoi???? "allezo opi omi" Putain ?'???
Candid funny mistake! The rider didn't look ahead, is his mistake also
:D :D  Nice
Like cycling Oxford Street in London.
That looked like an accident, would you put her in jail for knocking down a person riding a bike on the sidewalk by accident? NO, These guys are professional and the race is very important but it was a mistake, and that's how it should be seen. No more.
She wasn't even looking at the race. That's not a cycling fan, just an idiot who wants to be on TV.
Literally what a clown. Jail time would make sense.
That spectator should be handed a hefty fine....
Bravo les Bretons ! Vous qui ramenez toujours votre fraise
2:01 "Well, the stupidity of a fan at the side of the road"   BRAVO, for being truthful enough to call it exactly what it was.
OMG Years of Hard work, absolute dedication and Passion attacked by the worst stupidity ….its impossible to find a punishment That would justice That criminal Act
This roadside fan should be vilified exactly the way Chicago Cubs fan Steve Bartman was following the October 2003 baseball playoff game. [If this TdF fan received a beatdown 🙅]
Well that's embarrassing
That fan needs to be banished from whatever country their from...and that stupid smile
Obv a new stupidity law is needed!  lmfao
Jail the idiot!
how she can be so stupid ? what a stupid persons are out there. Put her in the jail for a week, thats onyl way how learn stupid people....
The fun begins at 1:30.
What a total prat!!
I just know they’re related to that squirrel from ice age...
Imagine her telling her family (opi & omi!) to watch fot her on the tv and then they see this happen
Conasse
Was für ne dumme SUA
So much training and so much money spent for something like this to happen. New spectator rules are needed. 😡
OMG
WHEN I'M IN CHARGE THE ASS WITH THE SIGN GETS BURNED ALIVE. WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
Did they murder the bastard  though?
I just made out that woman’s sign.  It says...“Visit my Instagram #FrenchWomanCheeseCrotch.”
There's always at least one moron in the bunch!
Identify and prosecute that non-fan!!
It is so unbelievable that this things keep happening still the stupidly of this lady is so amazing
why is there an overlay of a stage from the Tour 2 years ago?
Let's hope this jackass got taken care of in the parking lot later. To be honest, it's pretty stupid of them to allow fans to stand on the road. What the hell do they expect?
Lol dam that fan is absolutely mad
She gotta go
What a ****** ******* *****!  I'm really trying not to swear.
Insta is more pandemic then covid
new generations posing for social networks while the rest of the world collides because of them...
The entire peloton didn’t crash.
How ignorant can some people be? Where is security? What a shame
it is not the first time that such an incident has occurred, the organizers should set rules with fines and in case of injuries the prison. these athletes spend months training and can't lose to some idiot
what a perfect idiot!
This is no different than someone running onto a track and field event and wacking every competitor in the knees with a baseball bat
they gotta arrest her
Koszmar... Jakiś pajac z banerem, po prostu idiota.
It just makes my blood boil when people can be this stupidly ignorant.
Connasse
this is why there should be laws against people being within a certain distance of the riders.
🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽 what ws the guy on the bike looking at smh!!  dumbass
Some pretty lame comments from a few on here.  Fans need to learn from this.  Wish there could be more officials available to prevent something like this from occurring.  Fans standing by should also be aware to remove a fellow fan out of harms way if they see something this obviously dangerous occurring.  The lady probably thought the riders could just go around her but with the density of the peloton this was of course not possible.  Sad to see this.
nex time try this on motorway.....please!
dear Lady please avoid Slovenia!!!
0:50
So… I wonder what her opi and omi thinks about this
gang de clowns avec des tit casses
Non bastava dare a questi subumani il teatrino dei social media dove poter sfogare il proprio ego, si prendono comunque la scena ovunque. Queste sono delle piattole
Put this women in jail. Maybe they will learn this way.
Gaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh YOURE THERE TO WATCH THE RACE. WATCH THE RACE.
Hahahahahahahahaha
"Allez Opi Omi" - what dous that mean? <.<
Ma diostracane
so stupid! well my crash this week was caused crossing trolley tracks along the waterfront lol... looked about the same ;)
I felt embarrassed as a Britton for her behavior, but I hear she is German. A tourist probably. Well, she is in trouble.
That's hilarious. At 1:55 he deliberately came off his line specifically aiming for the spectator. This wouldn't be the first intentional crash at a Tour de France and it definitely won't be the last.
What a fucking idiot... Sign says "Let's go Opi-Omi" @0:48
what does the sign say?
The Tour de France filed a suit against the woman, a very rare move. She pissed everyone off.
Has she been arrested yet?
Stupid woman ,she wasn't looking, look at the huge damage she's caused ,unbelievable
Narcissist people are dangerous
karens ruining the world and the tour de france
Lol...
🤣
if you're at the front of the peloton you HAVE to be ready to take a fan out to protect your other riders.
Women 🤣
Opi and Omi are real pround of you girl...
I hope this stupid spectator got arrested und has to pay the damage of every bike!!!
She sould be arrested and locked for 3 years, so no other IDIOTS would do that
The entire peloton crashed lol. Some people don't half exagerate.
Bloody selfies and social media….some people are so bloody stupid and self centered!
A riders career can be gone due to a stupid idiot.
attention whores are dangerous because they don't pay attention to the race
Guillotine time. Old school French solution.
breaks my heart to see months if not years of training by these professionals to get to the tour for some idiot to ruin it all. MORE RESPECT PLEASE!!!
She should have stayed at home cooking for her Husband. Thats where she belongs.
It was a matter of time, knowing they are allowed still to get so close, every time
At the very least, I hope he/she will be severely fined for this stupid action
i cant stop laughing after focusing on their "happy" faces after they crashed
I wish she had to personally pay for all the equipment damage she caused, and face charges for the injuries she alone is responsible for by her reckless behaviour
Criminal Culpability?  Not sure about the laws in France.
that idiot should go a couple of months into the jail
ahahahah fucking melons
The peloton was the Walrus
The Rider thought it was just held there loosely but she held it the firm with both hands and made contact with his handlebars.. she is at fault.. fans need to Show more respect to the pros!
Opi and Omi said : "we do not know this bitch "
That crazy cyclist attacked that person for no fucking  reason Yo! He knew what he was doing, hope that person is okay and in a safe space!
That's one way to get on tv!
This is what the IDIOT non fans do !
No doubt he/she did it for the Gram, or some other social media gratification.😏
LOOOOOOL
Geez it's just a bike race. Shit happens.
That s why a woman should never stay near some wheels
Thank god UCI banned supertuck
That fan was almost 3 feet into the road man the brigade that comes before the riders needs to really put a emphasis on the spectators staying not only off the road but back a couple of feet
Idiot. She's not even a fan
"Allez Opi Omi"? What does that mean? Hope its worth that much skin peeled against the tarmac.
Is she in Jail?
hits cardboard, crashes. what a wuss.
Fan of what?
How the tables have turned when people hogg the roads.
If Steve Bartman had a sister who attended the Tour De France.
This is a great example why some people should not procreate and contaminate the human species.
Hope that guy geta a couple blackeyes at the pub later. Dickheads always interfering in France because morons are allowed on the shoulder. This has harmed many people and should be punished..
To pewnie polak
Don't even want to call her/him a "FAN", the person is a criminal...
I’ve seen shit saying “should have avoided the spectator”. BRO. HOW? Peloton to the left and more fans to the right?
Do you know what “entire” means?
She deserves to be banned from every UCI race as a spectator
😡😡
Very stupid people.
They should put her in jail.
Hilarious 🤣
So I could win this race just have spectators taking out the opposition with signs worth considering
