People who says that Brendan or Colin should have won, did you guys actually watched Austin as Elvis to actually comment he should not have won.
The U.S. in general was too wrapped up in Fraser's comeback narrative, crying in public and being a sexual assault victim. They also have an agenda to not give it to anyone in their first lead role.  Austin won:  Hollywood Foreign Press Golden Globe   British Academy of Film and Television Arts BAFTA  Irish Film and Television Academy IFTA   Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts AACTA International  Australian AACTA (Domestic)   Catalonia Spain Sant Jordi   South African Online Film Critics   International Press Academy Satellite   Portugal CinEuphoria  Sunset Circle   Starring Film Awards   Minnesota Film Critics  People's Choice   Alaska Film Critics  North America Film Critics   NBP Film Awards   And 15 Breakthrough Performance Awards (13 film critics and 2 film festivals)
He came after for that Oscar and failed lol
Austin was not only nominated for the Oscar, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild (Where most think he wins if he didn't have to face the obstacle of the Hollywood bias against awarding someone in their first leading role, and facing the irrelevant comeback narrative of Fraser and his crying in public) but Austin won The Foreign Press Golden Globe, UK BAFTA, Catalonia Sant Jordi, Australia AACTA International, South African Online Film Critics, International Press Academy Satellite, Irish International IFTA, CinEuphoria, Sunset Circle, Minnesota Film Critics and People's Choice, as well as 13 Breakthrough Performance awards, including two from the Palm Springs and Santa Barbara International Film Festivals.
Just a beautiful young man and so deserving of this Award, he was brilliant and I'm sure Elvis would be so touched by Austin's portrayal 🙂

Glad Brendan got the Critics Choice, SAG & OSCAR!
A classy and eloquent guy. Austin Butler will go far.
The U.S. in general was too wrapped up in Brendan Fraser's woe is me, personal life victim narrative.  Austin Butler dominated internationally where narrative isn't considered: Foreign Press Golden Globe, British Academy BAFTA, Australia Academy AACTA Int'l version, Irish Academy IFTA Int'l category, Catalonia Spain Sant Jordi, South African Film Critics, International Press Satellite, Brazil VHS Cut Awards.
Austin deserved the Oscar, too! Can’t win em all I guess
El Bafta lo ganó Austin, el Oscar lo ganó Brendan, que bueno que los premios se repartieron entre estos increíbles actores que dieron todo de sí y se merecen lo mejor
so happy he got the bafta
Brendan Fraser deserved it too
Felix Kammerer should have been nominated
I Bafta premiano il talento e la performance!Altro che quella pagliacciata degli Oscar...
Who were the two guys seating next to Dylan McCormack? Anyone?
That award was for Brendan Fraser
Absolutely.   The way he and Elvis scenes run into each other , they got me thinking 'who was who'!   I was so emotional that I need to watch it again to absorb it all !!!  It was phenomenal.   Brilliant Austin.   You deserve that Oscar!   This movie was not  just about playing the part. He took on the challenge of one of  the most famous Artists in the World with Elvis actual ex Wife and Daughter viewing in.  Then there was the dancing moves, the voice and singing.   As Lisa Marie said ..." He got it so right".   They would know forsure !
Really? Funny hahaha austin? Hahahahaha
Congrats looters for not nominating rrr
It should be Colin.
All did a great job, thank you 💚💚 is his eyes green or I see them so
All those nominees will always be winners ❤❤❤
Awsome speech
Wow i am so proud of you honey!!
BAFTA 2023 was So White!
Regards
Was hoping Brendan would win.
Well deserved and more.
Jeez, this guy. Like he killed it, but please drop the too cool for school James Dean act with a fake voice.
Yesss he is the actor of the moment, these is the Best performance, love Elvis, now for the Oscar,  you deserve it , wonderfull Men
Congratulations Austin you deserve it!!
Very happy 4 Austin because the performace as Elvis was AMAZING, I love it !!!
Congratulations Austin 👏This award is well deserved because Austin has made an incredibly performance of one of the most important artists in history, Elvis Presley, and has made a huge impact on the audience and film experts. We will see if he gets the Oscar too.
Merecidísimo. Enhorabuena Austin!!!
Very Beautiful 💕💕
I love bafta , because they not affected by agenda of black privilege , all love to the bafta ❤
OMG his face when his name was announced…..so adorable! 🥰
BRENDENS FACE WHEN AUSTIN WON. 😭🫶
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
✈️💖 I cheered for Austin Butler + to win the Oscars + finally + I'm blaming him for the Best Actor award + congratulations congratulations + I'll look forward to the next one + fighting
Was rooting for Colin but he still did a great job!
I hope Brendan will win the SAG and This would put things in a tie... and the best thing is that the tiebreaker would be at the Oscars. Crongratulations Austin.
The whale should be the winner
Congrats Austin! Great performance🏆🤎
I'm so happy for him. What a great talent and humble man. Congratulations Austin!
Does Julianne Moore ever age!!!
Brendan was robbed!! Period.
His surprise is so genuine and cute! ❤
Our boy from Disney Channel really did it 😭
He is yummy
I love Brendans reaction when Austin win...great human
Well well, what do you expect. All-white winners. Bland like un-seasoned chicken. No shock here.
So deserved, there is so much hate being thrown at Butler for winning this award, and it's BS, he was extraordinary in Elvis. It was more than just an impersonation. Glad to see Fraser genuinely happy for him, though I'd love for him to win. Farrell was great too. But I have no problem with Butler winning everything, he was electrifying and put his all into the performance. The biggest pressure is if he can ever top this performance, I can't imagine the pressure you'd feel to follow it up.
I’m absolutely over the moon to see Austin win the BAFTA, cause that man deserves it way more than anyone else!  Now it’s Oscars time!!
How the hell does he win over Ferrell and Fraser? Those are actual performances. Bafta really don't know what they are doing.
Congratulations! Elvis movie rules! Austin is an inspiration.
Yes mate we’ll deserve d and congrats bro ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
👏 Awesome! Love this for Austin. So very deserved. Fantastic performance.
This boy....., His mother in heaven was and ist still an Guardian Angel,so Loving,humble and Kind,i Hope you never lose all these Things, and i Hope dearly you surounded by caring,honest and Loving people, Elvis ist one of the sadest exempels in history. always gave me goosebumps when i listen to you, what a gentle Soul.  You deserve any Award, wish you from the bottom of my heard the OSCAR, you truly, truly deserves him⭐❤️⭐❤️⭐❤️
vrery well deserved!!!!!
Very well deserved. He transformed himself into Elvis for this film, that's something not many actors can do. And in the middle of all of this success, he walks up that stage and manages to be genuinely humble and kind. There's a bright future there. Congratulations, Austin.
No no no . Fraser deserves the win .
Austin Butler Congrats!!! 🎉
Enhorabuena por su talento y magnífica interpretación!!!!!
Congratulations Austin...Well Deserved.... 👍👍🙂
Austin could play a 1970's Tom Waits better than he does Elvis. I really see it.
Austin Butler really became Elvis and is light years beyond the other actors....and so grounded...Love you and thank-you Austin for the magic you bring us..Looking forward to more wins!!! and lots more roles for you xoxoxox Want to add we bought the film and have watched it 3x---Austin is Elvis when he sings. he so how makes me feel Elvis----..the nature of Elvis shines through this young man....even at the end...The film gets better everytime we watch it!!!!
I am so pleased and happy Austin won! 😍🤩 Well deserved! 🥰
❤I like him and he’s a real drama queen. Reminds me of Brando when he was on the witness stand😊
Seems like a real cool genuine man, speaks so calm and chilled, brilliant winners speech.
He was good. 😊
Once again, we came to the conclusion that it is enough to interpret a famous personality like Freddie Mercury, Churchill or Elvis and you will automatically be awarded. As sublime a performance as Fraser's, it's overlooked simply for the "controversy". Kudos to the Bafta for demonstrating the closed and backward minds of voters. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This guy really captured the Spirit of the greatest entertainer that ever lived. He was Rocks first Superstar. Austin Butler was utterly compelling to watch. He deserved this award. Nice to see Britain acknowledge his performance 👏 👏👏
I hope he wins the oscar
My boyfriend pove of you
I LOVED Elvis and Butlers performance so much!! I am so split on Austin Butler and Brendan Fraser for the Oscar. Both of them were absolutely incredible
Paul Mescal robbed 😢
BRENDAN FRASER WAS ROBBED!
As an Elvis fan I was nervous about seeing the film because so many impersonators have a tendency towards parody, but Austin got to the heart of the great man, he didn't impersonate he became Elvis. If Austin doesn't win SAG or the Oscars then they are worthless, one of THE best films I've ever seen, so much more impressive than Rami Malek (but then 'Elvis' is in a different class, and I say that as a Queen fan also).
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Irish people didn't deserve this ..
Wonderful great actor!!!!
He gave a remarkable speech. But is this performance really a BAFTA worthy.
no love for Brendon Fraser?
So deserved!  He deserves the Oscar!  ❤
He's great and all, but for some reason I can't help but sense a bit of insincerity.. Sorry
Wow.  I mean he did a good impersonation of Elvis, but the movie was just another Baz Luhrmann fever dream.
Oscar's on his way ❤️
Brandan Fraser>>>>>>>>>>>>
Brendan Fraser’s face when Austin wins is priceless 🤣😂
Very deserving. Austin you are great. You are King Elvis personified. Now, let's march to OSCAR 2023!
This is a big surprise because BAFTA only give out awards to European related.
BAFTA goes to Elvis Butler ....good. Ok.
Congrats to Austin!
So proud of him
My baby won ❤
that's called speech , no bullshit no agenda only heartfelt thanking to near and dear one
Really happy for him!!!
Those who are still saying he's not gonna win the Oscar. Please wake up from the delusion. Y'all said he will never win the BAFTA and GG but he did 😂 he has more chance of winning right now than Brendan or Colin Farrell 🤷🏻‍♀️
Congraturations! This is GREAT!!
So nice to see all the comments agreeing about something for a change.  What a kindhearted young man. His mum must be looking down on him and be so proud ❤️
congratulations!
I would say Austin is the favourite to take the Oscar.
It should have been Brendan Fraser 🤧
I'm sure After the Oscar he will Lost elvi's voice 😅😅😅
Colin was robbed. But I'm glad they awarded Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan! Banshhes of Insihserin was one of my favourite movies of 2022.
he should play james bond. reminds me of young pierce brosnan. so cute guy austin.
Before ELVIS I'd never heard of him. I do remember a brief disappointment when I read that this unknown (to me!) actor was going to play the icon that is Elvis Presley.  There are so many imposters out there, making a living, touring and PRETENDING.  Oh my! How wrong I was. I'm sorry I was only able to see ELVIS twice in the cinema, but I can play it now anytime - and I do - at home. Well done, Austin. You've made so many proud. This speech has me in tears, and I just want to hug you!
Austin deserves every award on this earth  not only for his performance in Elvis but also for his ground to earth nature.
Way to go Austin!
Ive been there since the SHARPAYS ADVENTURE BABY
Yes im so happy for him truly deserved elvis is celebrating right now 🥳
He really deserves golden. Globe, now the baftas next is Oscars is it .... He was phenomenal as Elvis, the best ever !!!
I'm a bit gutted that Colin didn't win but well done Austin
Awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️
This young man is so honest and pure
Yayyyy Austin. Congratulations! Well Deserved. Beautiful Speech.  I'm praying Austin will win The Sag and the Academy Award. Love You Austin
Well deserved 👏🏻👏🏻
Congratulations again Austin💐..now let's go for the OSCAR
An absolutely beautiful man, inside and out...so well deserved!!
Great not just because he won but to rub salt in the faces of the pundits even though obviously he’s been nominated they never spoke about him winning he won not only for his acting but the dedication he put in to fill the biggest shoes of all that’s not to say other actors don’t because they do but with Elvis people always think of the image stick a jumpsuit on they’re Elvis but to capture his innocence and vulnerability was dedication
Bravo ! Felicitări mister Austin Butler !
Austin and Brendan y’all poured your hearts and souls into your craft Well done I wish him and Brendan had been tied but Austin chances of winning an Oscar are looking great.
Brendan Frasers reaction is so pure
Congratulations  well deserved 🎊 👏 💐 🥳 🎊 The Oscar is next 🙏
So proud of you Austin
Incredible category but that means collin or brendan will win the oscar , this stuff is organised but never the less all amazing
Congrats & God Bless Austin 🎊 ~ Ur Soo Humble & To Thank "The Presleys Again 💖  😢 I Know Lisa Is "Proud looking down 😢
Very happy for him!! His commitment was TREMENDOUS!!! And he basically had to age before our eyes, it was like creating 3  characters in the same movie!!! Not just to nail one and keep it thru 3hrs of movie. That’s hard work what he did!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
He was trying not to show it, but Colin Farrell was not best pleased lol...
Congratulations again Austin 👏👏👏👏👏
He didn't mention Lisa Marie what a dud!
Austin, you are so deserving. Congratulations.
Bullshit….Not right
This show stank worse than a portable toilet over a hot bank holiday weekend.
Elvis was a nice movie
paul mescal!!!!
He deserves it!!!  Very happy for him.
Next, Oscar🏆
Congrats Austin. :) well done.
Justice for Branden FRAISER!!!
If you told me 15 years ago that a C-list actor from Nickelodeon and Disney Channel would play Elvis Presley in a biopic movie directed by Baz Luhrmann and win the BAFTA award, i'd be laughing at your face. Now i'm absolutely satisfied with Austin's success
I love how genuinely happy Brendan seems for Austin despite the former not winning.
It makes me SO HAPPY when Austin wins as it is so deserving.  I love the quote by Gary Oldman, "There are times when Austin has so much CHARISMA you forget you are watching an ACTOR, and you feel like you are watching Elvis Presley.  Austin Butler has a SPECIAL AURA, a quality that cnnot be built".  Austin is the MOST special, charismatic actor to come along since Daniel Day Lewis, Robert DiNero and Leo DiCaprio. his acting achievement eclipses all the nominees. God bless you Austin you have given a LOT of every day people something to cheer about and gave us a glimpse of Elvis, himself.   Remember you have a powerful angel in Lisa Marie and she is cheering for you and so proud of you!
yesssssssssssssssssssss
Brendan Fraser❤️❤️mí favorito.
Congrats, well deserved.
Buuuuu😮
Now, The Oscar goes to him. This Guy is fantastic!!!
I’m in tears, congrats Austin!!!! 🖤
"Keep on hoping grandma"
Amazing speech
EXCELLENT speech 👏🏻
This award could not possibly have gone to anyone but Austin Butler for his amazing portrayal of the greatest entertainer that ever lived.The King.👑
Austin's career is on the rise, imagine the heights he will reach. He has a few new movies coming out, I can't wait to see where he takes us next
Forgot to thank his voice coach ! Rude.
How to win an award? Easy. Play a biopic lol. Not to disgrace his acting but come on Paul, Colin and Brendan did a better job than Austin.
Brendan Fraser's reaction is priceless...
The Oscars is next for Austin! I truly hope he will win an Academy Award for Best Actor. He’s a great new star of Hollywood with both look and talent.
Nioooooo... Brendan Fraser, you had to be the winner !! 😫
You can tell the difference  between him and barry keoghan, Austin seems really hollywood and overly dramatic and false,(especially with that stupid voice) and Barry just sounds like he ran from the bus stop
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍
Legend legend legend
🎭  ah ah....😝
Congratulations 🎉 well deserved 🎉 TCB
Colin Ferrell: FECK!
So happy he won!😂😄😀
Congratulations Austin! I wonder if he'll win Oscar too
Austin butler    brendan fraser   y colín farrell 👏
Que gran alegría  saber que gano
👏Felicidades  austin merecido
Do actors really care for awards?? Do they act when giving the winners speech?
Damn he’s racking up all of the awards
Well deserved he played Elvis so well!
So happy that he won another award now let’s get the Oscars he deserves all the awards he can get with that performance of a life time.🎉❤
Congratulations! Well deserved!🤩
That’s fantastic!  Such a deserved win for him!  Congrats Austin! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼♥️
Still rooting for Brendan Fraser, but this is definitely an Oscar Race between Austin and Brendan.
I’m so incredibly happy for him.
As well as an amazing actor, Austin Butler really comes across as a genuine and likeable man. A well-deserved award.
Colin robbed
Congratulations Austin! You deserve it for working on this for nearly 3 years!
Pior que o todos prêmios o Austin ganhou o rami Malek venceu Kkkk o rami não venceu o crítics choice awards igual o Austin butler então é muito provável ele vença o sag e o Oscar
This beautiful, humble human being. I loved him during the movie and I love him even more now. Lisa Marie is shinning from above with the King himself Elvis being very proud. RIP to them both. Baz you are amazing and should have been nominated for best Director at the Oscars... Congrats and well done,,
LOOK HOW HAPPY BRENDAN IS FOR AUSTIN!!
He really deserves all the awards. HIs performance in Elvis was exceptional. Next is SAG and the Oscars !
Imagine Austin Butler as the leading man in the war movie set in the town of Chillingbourne. 🎥🎥🎥
you made Elvis ,Lisa and your fans so proud.. i cant explain how happy i am
congrats Austin. Your performance was phenomenal.
He deserved it! I'm so happy for Austin! He's a truly gentleman's! His mom and Lisa Marie would be proud.   Congratulations to the rest of the nominees. I mean, they're fantastic!
Austin Butler has won the award again.First he won the Golden Globe and now he won the BAFTA award.I can’t wait to see him winning the SAG award and an Oscar.Congratulations to Austin Butler!🎉
I was rooting for Farrell... Still a great speech and carreer in front of Austin. With his talent and mentality he is destined to write history
If he wins SAG, it's done.
I wish Brendan had gotten it but I’m happy for Austin as well.
I always thought that award shows were just shallow and did t choose the right people but I think there is still hope. We love you Austin❤
Overrated
Yeah! Austin you did it! I am so happy for you. You did such an amazing job impersonating Elvis. Nobody could have done it better than you. You really felt Elvis’ energy and that clearly showed throughout the movie. I’m sure you made everybody proud and you can be proud of yourself. You are such a lovely and adorable guy❤️
Congratulations ,  so delighted  for you  Austin  this award  is so well deserved ❤
Yeeeeeeeeessssss!!!!!!!!! I cried and screamed happy and very proud tears for Austin!!!! No one deserves to win each and every award for best actor more than him! Can't wait for him to win an Oscar and SAG! 🎉🎉🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆❤❤❤❤
Well deserved, unknown to me prior to Elvis but made me a big fan of him and made me a bigger fan of Elvis himself due to his portrayal. Bravo. As a Brit myself extremely proud our British ceremony has awarded a great performance.
He's my winner for the Oscar, but I did want Colin Farrell to win here
So happy for Austin Butler.. frikken brilliant performance 🎉👏such humble Sweet man

Austin will win SAG and then Oscar
So happy for him💯❤️👏👏👏🫶⭐️⭐️
Ah man, hoped Brendan Fraser would win. Speechless after his performance in the Whale. Hopefully he gets that Oscar 🙌🏻
Well done Austin Butler!😃 deserved prize, this year 3 incredible performances (Austin Butler, Brendan Fraser e Colin Farrel) all 3 deserve to win!  Curious to see who will win at the Oscar…😉
Elvis the supporting actor?
Argh, je suis déçue!
Fix the title.
He’s coming for that Oscar
Wrong title. This is Best Lead Actor.
Oh boy you best rename this one quick
Who was he supporting? Tom Hanks terrible acting.
