YESSS LOTTIE!!!!
2:36 is my favorite part. I love the key change.
One of my favorites
This makes me so happy😊❤
I cannot wait USA
Maneskin was great band  I feel like Damiano lost something in him since  starting to sing solo. Arrangement is not unique. I hope he is enjoying his song because I can’t stop feeling that he’s dying singing typical American songs which his producers asking him to sing. I even can’t recognize his special voice in his songs. He was extraordinary and now… I just not enjoying as it was. Not the same energy 🥺 Just really hoping that Damiano is ok with this kind of songs
Love it ❤
This made me smile.
This girl is from my school no joke❤😊
PERFECT 💗💗💋💋💋
Can't waaaait!!!
We need more mornings like this from Ed ❤
привет

Que hermoso video
tudo que esse homem faz é perfeito
I'm quite impressed by how unfazed Sheeran's daughter is by being recorded. I kept thinking: she is either a natural or they've built their own world in this morning routine. Or both. beautiful video!   As an aspiring mother, I couldn't ignore the amount of energy involved - lots of jumping, etc - I wondered if I'd have it when that opportunity was given to me in the future. but I guess there's no way to know, prep. only going with the flow and doing one's best.
the music is very nice, now you teach the little girl to grow the table top 😊
Ed never disappoints
Wow very beautiful video dear Ed absolutely 💎 diamond ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😘
Hello jag heter saga Gerebro jag bor i Sunne kommun på Mårdvägen 15 jag gillar dig och din låt perfekt 😍 ❤♥️🩷💜

Ed, I love how your teaching your daughter to be creative and giving her a love of life. Your a great dad.
Love it
Я думала ,что в клипе его дочь ,но прочла ,что Лайра родилась в 21 году.А эта девочка выглядит на 5-6 лет.

Hi Ed Sheeran I'm coming to your next concert
Hello Ed I hope all is well.....I was thinking....Jay Leno has an actual hired crew to keep his cars nice and shiny and running........I would like to apply to be your watch guy.......Time matters....
I absolutely love this song Dusty. It is so Ed Sheeran, and I bet he is a great dad and Sherry is a great mom.
I’m listening to this in my garden with my dogs playing this song over and over again because it’s my favourite 😊
This is my favourite song Dusty love it ❤
This needs re-releasing this should be a lot more viral then it is. By far one of your best songs! ❤
F.frumos !!!❤❤❤❤
RONALD WEASLEY!  HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!  I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!  YOUR FATHER IS FACING AN INQUERY AT WORK INTIRLEY BECAUSE OF YOU.  IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE WILL SEND YOU STRAIGHT HOME.
❤ "... HOAX‼️‼️‼️" ❤👏🙌✌️🙏 XoxoxoX 💋
❤❤❤nobody knows what we are going through...it was like hell ..in this moment there was a feeling that someone out is there who understand and cares for you...and it helps me to go forward...it was the strength..god told me already that he will send to me someone... god send me to him that he can help me and that i can help him to let the toxic area where he was ..so just smile and be happy please ...i thank you and deep inside pray for you that you can get so much success with your fam and health ..everyone in your fam should laugh and be happy ..if you help sincerely you will get 10 times more back
i dreamt of my papa the other night. We were dancing around the room as this song plays. My feet resting on his in a way that he can just guide my movements. I asked where mama is to which he replied "she'll be home soon, you just have to wait." I cant even remember some details of the dream, but i woke up, feeling the tears form. Its been a while since my parents went to heaven, so dreaming about them in my time of struggle feels both like a comfort and a punishment, knoing that id never be with them again in this life. I miss them.
I love this song I love Ed Sheeran ❤
❤❤❤❤Love this wonderful man. His voice us soothing love all his songs!! Great video
Ob Ed mit seinen Töchtern auch zusammen backt?Seine Musik ist jedenfalls cool.❤
This song spins me around to the BEST moments in my life…Excellent words, choreography, actress and actor; as well as all the hard work~~~>I’ll definitely keep replaying it 😘🥰

Thank you Ed, I needed to hear this today. Very dark days for us at the moment and this song what exactly what I needed to hear. It has grounded me and reminded me that although it is tough at the moment, there are blue skies ahead. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
All I could think was… who had to clean that mess up… his wife? 😂
Damn Ed. Make me cry with a happy song. But it doesn't seem to hold a lot of happy.
c'est mon fan prèfèré,j'adore toutes ses chansons, et dire qu'l a commencer si bas pour arrivé au sommet, bisous ed Sheeran

Is that his wee girl?
This music video gives me so much joy, no girls twerking on a yatch or some guys talking about guns and gangs or someone on pills or getting drunk. Just a goofy old man sharing nothing but pure love with this daughter. This is why I love Ed.
🩵🩵🩵how does it get any better than that!
LOVE!))
I feel like Ed is finally making the music he really likes❤
So much cute  ❤️🥺

Those watching in 2023❤
music is just like the song: Pehla Pehla Pyar (singer: KK)
im 36 never had kids, live at the family home still to help my parents cause they older so when my neice sleeps over everytime she goes home shes needs me to carry her to car, even if its 8am and im still asleep, i get woken up by this amazing angel asking me to just carry her to the car and put her in her car seat (shes 6) and i will have no problem waking up at any hour she needs me and will do it until shes at the age where she just stops asking. this song and video reminds me of her so much.
I know that boat. I'm the 16 year old from the bus stop sitting on the bench with nowhere to go and crying because inside the boat was my now ex boyfriend. Your door is the first one on the right.
❤❤❤
OMG that's the boat house. I can't tell you enough thank you and your brothers for taking me in at such a crucial time in my life. if your mom would have said no, I would have been on the streets. Bob and Deena also. you were a perfect gentleman even when we were that young. Thank you!
I heard it from someones phone ringtone and now iam in love with this song
❤️😍
This is for my daughter ❤ a Love through the universe 🌠 greater than anything Else. Even greater than the Love could possibly feel Like.  Even if Life is dusty. Children are our biggest Blessing.
ᴬʸᵐ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊

My kids love this one too❤❤❤
Nice one..like this music
I promise to love my daughter always and I tell her every day that i love her my angel
This video is like Ed sheer an telling a story but singing it.😶
Y si. Con la guita que tiene el enchastre se lo limpia otro y disfruta de lo que tiene que disfrutar. Así es más fácil.
😂
💓💞
Ed has excellent taste  … and has written a really cool song about  listening with his lovely daughter to the music of Dusty Springfield & her classic Dusty in Memphis album from 1969. .. ❤❤❤❤
🧘🏼‍♂️💕✨
😊
😊
I love this song ❤ so much
💜💜💜
Nice video , is she your daughter ?
🥰
Prometo que desde este video en adelante, no miro para atrás.
Ahhh me enamoré de este video😍 Exactamente así disfrutaba cada momento en soledad, y también ella podía con sus espacios dibujar y muchas cosas más. Te cuento un secreto extraño muchísimo todos esos momentos, teníamos la libertad de cambiar nuestro mundo a cada instante, sin ser perfectas, nuestros tiempos de trabajo estudio  disfrutar y hacer la tarea. Pero bueno se ve que cayó una lechuza a mí vida que se ensañó conmigo. Me alegra muchisimo que tengas ese alma tan simple noble y humilde que te lleva tan lejos. Tu personalidad me recuerda a aquella parte que hoy me cuesta recuperar de mí vida y anhelo con toda mí alma
🥰

is the kid his real daughter?
Love it
What a good husband 😮
In the dusty attic of his childhood home, Ed found an old boat covered in memories. With eyes closed, he recalled the colorblind sunsets over salt water, the laughter of youth that once sparkled like Vega, and the sound of sycamore leaves rustling in the wind. Life goes on, but sometimes we must pull back the curtains to revisit the borderline between past and present, finding that in the hills of Aberfeldy, there are no strings attached to the nostalgia that binds us.
In this video Ed Sheeran looks exactly like a millenial dad, so cute and relatable
You are t he best. We ever in I will always love you and like you.

Bombs  and helicopters  willing  to go to u  Ypu.might just be there
Initially, I was drawn to this song for its chill vibe. However, after watching this video, I realized that it is more than the vibe or the melody.  It beautifully portrays Ed Sheeran's journey as a father, which resonates with me as a new mom.
Que chico tan hermoso, te amooo
I'm glad to hear that Ed is fan of the late, great Dusty Springfield.  I am, too!
Ed Sheeran❤❤❤👏🏾👏🏾🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴
So sweet!
This song always brightens the mood for me, thanks alot Ed❤😊❤
✋
I really want to see you in person so bad but it probably won’t happen
My wife and I went to Ed's multiply concert when we were still boyfriend/girlfriend. It was one of the best nights of our lives. Now, years later, I get to share the feels with Ed as I now have kids of my own. It's so great to see how his music has evolved, and we've evolved with him.
2.35 kinda ruins the song imo
I’m literally ovulating Ed
The moment when I realised in real also his daughter picks out a vinyl when Ed is at home (isn't touring)during their vinyl breakfast >>>>>>
Great song and video. Love him!!!
iLike Ed sheeran
Ed Sheeran¡!!!¡!!!!!!
I wish we were best friends
Omg i really wish I could meet ed sheeran
Man this album have every good song ❤!
Happy Father’s Day Ed and everyone else! ❤🙏🏽✨
Se pudesse curtir um milhão de vezes, eu fazia, amei a música
Is that one of your kids
cool
@Ed Sheeran   is so amazing
😊 súper tierno
Memories will last forever , thanks Ed
❤ Beautiful
Oh my god the girl in the video is that meant to be lyra when she grows up? Aww 🥺🥰❤️❤️   P.S Ed eating the whipped cream straight out of the can is me 😂😉❤️! Wow imagine Ed making you pancakes 🥞😋🥰❤️
is that his real daughter?
Ed I added you on snapchat!
I heard you callin', now my eyes are open Day is breaking into powder blue Sunlight is framin' our every moment What a way to start off the day with you  Flick a finger Start a discussion to pick a singer This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her Just let the speakers take you away  And drop the needle on Dusty Frost on the leaves like a lake The moment came out of nothin' A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night But I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in the low tide But we gotta wait 'til our clothes are bone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  We were lost within a stormy ocean Nobody knew what we were goin' through We talk about it as we dip our toes in Take a breath and brace for the waves with you  Flick a finger Wait for the magic to do its thing, yeah There's more than sadness we got within us Let's put some color into the gray  And drop the needle on Dusty Frost on the leaves like a lake The moment came out of nothin' A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night But I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in the low tide We gotta wait 'til our clothes are bone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  Nothing but static on the stereo before today Both on the edge to throw it all away I used to think that every situation stayed the same But I can see they start to change, okay  Drop the needle on Dusty Frost on the leaves like a lake The moment came out of nothin' A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in the low tide We gotta wait 'til our clothes are bone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  Drop the needle on Dusty Drop the needle on Dusty
Is that his actual daughter?😭😭
Very beautiful song and wonderful video❤️❤️❤️😀👍
Awe Ed Sheeran that is so beautiful
Am I dreaming, you just reel is in with your love.  At 61, where the hell have you been.  Nothing compares to you, never has and probably never will.
❤
❤❤beautiful song ❤
❤Wonderful song. !❤
I love his music cause he tells us about his life 🤎
Ed is like the brother who you've seen grow from this awkward guy to an amazing father. And you just can't help but root for him. By showing us your vulnerabilities, you helped us overcome our own aches and fears. You deserve all the love in the world. 💛
Such an upbeat sweet song. Adorable Video clip as well! Another fantastic song Ed! ❤
Ed you are so ....  special for me ❤️
Perfection of a father ♥️
Is that Ed's daughter. She's precious. It's pretty cool .. Great song!

that's not his actual daughter, is it??
I saw videos of songs from 1 to 14/18, looks like one story, reminds me of one spanish singer, Antonio Orozco, with different episodes
'Messy' would be a better name for this video 😂
He is wearing an Omega x Swatch BioCeramic Speedmaster MoonSwatch Mission to Jupiter
The wife's gonna go mad after seeing the mess they made!
I LOVE this. So good.
This is my cancer fight song!! Thank you for having such a good and uplifting music.
Mi sveglio tutte le mattine ascoltando Dusty. Mi rallegra la giornata, anche se il testo é un po triste.

I'm 63 years old. I saw Mr. Sheeran two nights ago in Clearwater FL. He played the entire album. When he explained this song, I believe, I was one of few that knew who "Dusty" was. As a kid Dusty Springfield was a voice I knew......along with her hits. "Drop a needle" was recognized as a term for playing a vinyl album. Great lyric. Great song. Great album......and yes.....I purchased it. Also, saw him in a 2200 seat hall. Hey Ed "you rock". Thank you.
ele deve ser um pai tão bom 🥹❤️

Dusty Te escuché llamarme, ahora mis ojos están abiertos El día está amaneciendo en un azul claro La luz del sol encuadra cada momento nuestro Qué manera de empezar el día contigo  Muevo un dedo Empiezo una discusión para elegir un cantante Te encantará esta, tenía que traerla Solo deja que los altavoces te lleven  Y pongo el vinilo de Dusty La escarcha en las hojas como en un lago El momento surgió de la nada Una hermosa sonrisa en tu rostro Ayer fue una noche larga Pero siento que el futuro es tan brillante Toda la presión se fue con la marea baja Tenemos que esperar hasta que nuestra ropa esté completamente seca Así que pondré el vinilo de Dusty  Nos perdimos en un océano tormentoso Nadie sabía lo que estábamos pasando Hablamos de ello mientras mojamos nuestros dedos Tomo aire y me preparo para las olas contigo  Muevo un dedo Espero a que la magia haga su trabajo, sí Hay más que tristeza dentro de nosotros Pongamos algo de color en el gris  Y pongo el vinilo de Dusty La escarcha en las hojas como en un lago El momento surgió de la nada Una hermosa sonrisa en tu rostro Ayer fue una noche larga Pero siento que el futuro es tan brillante Toda la presión se fue con la marea baja Tenemos que esperar hasta que nuestra ropa esté completamente seca Así que pondré el vinilo de Dusty  Nada estático en el estéreo antes de hoy Ambos al borde de tirarlo todo a la basura Solía pensar que cada situación se mantenía igual Pero puedo ver que comienza a cambiar, está bien  Pongo el vinilo de Dusty La escarcha en las hojas como en un lago El momento surgió de la nada Una hermosa sonrisa en tu rostro Ayer fue una noche larga Pero siento que el futuro es tan brillante Toda la presión se fue con la marea baja Tenemos que esperar hasta que nuestra ropa esté completamente seca Así que pondré el vinilo de Dusty  Pongo el vinilo de Dusty Pongo el vinilo de Dusty

Makes me wanne make pancakes with pieces of fruit. Never tried this 😊 I'm gonna make this with my daughter 😍
I heard you callin', now my eyes are open Day is breaking into powder blue Sunlight is framin' our every moment What a way to start off the day with you  Flick a finger Start a discussion to pick a singer This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her Just let the speakers take you away  And drop the needle on Dusty Frost on the leaves like a lake The moment came out of nothin' A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night But I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in the low tide But we gotta wait 'til our clothes are bone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  We were lost within a stormy ocean Nobody knew what we we're goin' through We talk about it as we dip our toes in Take a breathe and brace for the waves with you  Flick a finger Wait for the magic to do its thing, yeah There's more than sadness we got within us Let's put some color into the gray  And drop the needle on Dusty Frost on the leaves like a lake The moment came out of nothin' A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night But I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in the low tide We gotta wait 'til our clothes are bone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  Nothing but static on the stereo before today Both on the edge to throw it all away I used to think that every situation stayed the same But I can see they start to change, okay  Drop the needle on Dusty Frost on the leaves like a lake The moment came out of nothin' A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in the low tide We gotta wait 'til our clothes are bone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  Drop the needle on Dusty Drop the needle on Dusty  Source: LyricFind  Songwriters: Aaron Brooking Dessner / Edward Christopher Sheeran  Dusty lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC
Dusty sehr schöner Song ❤gefällt mir sehr gut 👍

How lovely is this video ! ❤
This song made my heart smile❤️

Best father ever. Made me cry
Aquarius Dad Best Chef.👨🏼‍🍳 ☺️💛
Just the feeling we get only at the moment we're with our loving ones <3
❤❤❤
Ahmazing artist.... true talent
Is that Nicole kidmans daughter?
amazing t-shirt
This song is a much needed calm in the center of this storm of an album...Ed knew if we went straight from "life goes on" directly into "End of Youth" nobody would be able to handle it
This is so beautiful!!!! Emotions running all over 👏👏👏
Me encanta todo el Album Nuevo de Ed Sheeran !!!
Awwww Ed, your an amazing father, remember this the power of the father
What a delightful child!  Fun house hold thanks to Mr. Sheeran's great dad skills
💙 🎵
❤Ed inspired me to go all in  with my music . He was just like me , an artist trying to get heard .And now he's on top. It's happening for me , and I'm not stopping when it does !❤
Meh
Wow
I don't know if anybody wants to hear this but I'll say it to everyone reading this... Don't stop grinding and hustling until you feel fulfilled, it's not all about been on top, the highest thing is just to feel fulfilled as you. Love yourselves and believe in yourselves because that's what will fuel your energy each time you feel like giving up. I don't have so many subscribers but the ones I have are so special to my struggle so far. I'm grateful they believe in me, they're the reason i will keep putting in my best ❤❤❤
So glad Ed, that you and your family are healthy, getting stronger and shining brighter this year despite the harsh gray life throws at you. SHINE ON🌞🌟🤟
Love this song!!!
Dusty - I wrote this about waking up in the mornings with my eldest daughter. I would get in late from being at Jamal’s mural and cry myself to sleep, then wake up hours later to an energetic, beautiful, smiling girl. It was a real juxtaposition. Children are incredible how they can just bring so much joy into dark situations without knowing it. I took her downstairs, made breakfast, and we put a vinyl on. Every morning we do this. And she chooses it. Flick a finger, start a discussion to pick a singer. And the singer this particular morning was Dusty Springfield. So we dropped the needle on Dusty  - Ed Sheeran
Ed Sheeran always favourite ❤❤
Could somebody, please, post a version without needles dangling in the background 🙏
Otra grandiosa cancion por parte de Ed Sheeran :)
Wie süß ist das denn bitte? Geht direkt mitten ins ❤
Everyone looks at him as an idol, but he’s Dad to a beautiful little girl and there’s nothing more beautiful than the relationship between a father and daughter 🤍
Love, love, love this
The only artist I know who is happy with his life ❤️
😘😍🥰 2:21
Collab with jelly roll would be insane

Love.  Love.  Love.❤

THAT'S JOY 😍 TO LISTEN TO 👏😊
This is too precious. 💖💖💖
If this video doesn't have every woman's womb aching for Ed Sheeran, I don't know what will. He's a Golden Retriever.
♥♥♥
It is 1am here and now I have a desire to make pancakes 😂
Is that his own daughter in this video?
Man's dying and having flashbacks in the form of music  Kinda wish I'd have sum when I eventually go too

More school kid lyrics
This is a cute video but it also made me kinda sad. I got single dad vibes, widower vibes, that the love of his life is no longer there so he is pouring his all into the other love of his life, his child. He is her guide to the world and even if it not "conventional" you cannot doubt there is love in that house and at the end of the day, Love....it wins.
The real Ed Sheeran
Lyra and Jupiter have the best dad❤️❤️
What a beautiful song and music video 🙂 well done, I love your work!

Reminds me of my dad and his record collection, he put music and singing in my bones 😊Music makes me happy- this is a beautiful song about that for me.
Do not know why this song reminds me of Micheal Jackson.. especially the Bridge.
Good song is dusty
this is so sweet <3
This song has become my favorite, as it serves as a reminder to always appreciate the little things in life. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to overlook the small, everyday moments that bring joy and make life meaningful. Sometimes it takes a simple melody or a few well-crafted lyrics to bring our attention back to the beauty in simplicity.

Sweet. Lovely video
This is my favourite video of the visual album, it's so beautiful and wholesome. There is nothing more I would want than this when I grow up and have kids <3
I really love the vibe of this video. Ed's MV is always my favourite.
I knew about Ed before I even knew about tiktok

Thank you so much for being there for me for 7 years of my life your music is like a bandage to whatever i am going through. Keep doing what your doing and PLEASE keep making bangers like these ❤
My favorite song. So mellow, relaxing, and uplifting.
Being old enough to remember dropping a needle on a record, and to know who Dusty was doesn't stop me from being  young at heart enough to love Ed and everything he does.
amazing..
Wonderful story!! <3
i already loved the song, and then i went to see the video, its so cute, my heart is literally melting:))
He never disappoints us! ❤
Que paz siento cuando escucho esta canción ♡

A cada dia mais supresas. A cada dia melhores surpresas com Ed Sheeran...
Wow. My Dad raised me since I was 9. He also told me to choose my waves. ❤ happy tears. My dad's music helped us through. Now my kids are grown, music 🎶 is how I deal with the changes I can't deal with. Can't believe how time flew by. This song brings me right back to being nine years old. Us against the world. ❤

This was the first visualizer that made me cry. In spite of the heaviness in a lot of these songs, there’s something really beautiful about this version of him. He’s not a celebrity or a singer/songwriter, he’s just dad and that’s enough. I really love that, thanks for letting us see it ❤
Ед,спасибо тебе за твои песни ,за твое творчество.Хоть ты и живешь в другой стране но все о чем ты поешь нам близко по духу.Все будет хорошо!
That was absolutely adorable!
Been listening to you since HS(that's over a decade) and am glad you don't have to stop making music ❤

Is this his real daughter? Or an actor?
Thank you Ed. My bestfriend for 15 years lost his grandpa the same day your album released and it hit us hard.. he was like a second grandpa for me and a father for him and it’s hard right more because this is the first time he’s going through grieving a death. The song and Eyes closed legit had me crying watching the documentary 😢😢. I really appreciate it because it’s hard letting emotions out sometimes.
.
ED...you made this song specially for me and my daughter(Kendra)this got me joyfully emotional as am tearing up.its lyrics narrates our story.thanks ❤
His songs always go well 😍
❤❤
I love you, Ed ❤

So love that video.😃👍

ELE É O MELHOR DE TODOS
Ed sana infancias: el videoclip
😊❤❤
Thank you for creating the most incredible music for all of us from an incredibly hard time in your life. You are an inspiration to all of us, keep being an absolute icon.
Question, that surely isnt her actual daughter in this MV? She looks like 6 instead of 2.
I watched the whole thing with a smile on my face
😍😍😍
step by dad
Excellent ❤
My God your music is always amazing 💕💕💕 thank you for sharing your life with us ❤️❤️🙏❤️❤️🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
The kitchen of wonder. Drug influenced? Ed I know what your singing about. Unfortunately due to my production limits. Tight Arse Productions has bankrupt itself. Peace man.
Beautiful lyrics 😊😊
Dusty was my fav song of the album upon my first listen. Such a relaxing tune. Looking forward to explore all the songs in more depth over the coming days
Who put a like on this video before even listen to it, wow this is a nice song love how it sound cool💜💜💜
Such a simple yet sweet and wonderful video.
Is the football match live from stamford? lol
I can relate to this song with my dad and I, I love him so much. Ed really did a lovely job with this one! ❤
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised 15
I feel like Ed has come a long way since we first saw his stories, when he was an up and coming star
He probably know how to put smile on his audience face😌❤ Thank you Teddy for this album. All songs are so good. I am overwhelmed🤗
Wow..Dusty...Ed Sheeran..You're A Legend In Your Own Right...(love the video coverage too!)  👏✌️👍🏼👏✌️👍🏼👏💪💪💪

😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Back in 1969/70 Dusty Springfield had a house next door to our student hall of residence at QEC on Campden Hill Road, Kensington. The same period that Stevie Wonder came to a music gig we were holding. Happy Days! 😊
Estou viciado nessa música adorei

Lyrics?
Meraveglioso,
I heard you callin', now my eyes were open babe The day's breaking in the powder blue Sunlight's framin' now in every mornin' What a way to start off the day with you  I'll flick a finger I start a discussion to pick a singer This one will do, I had to bring her Just at the speaker, still give away  And drop the needle on Dusty Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night, but I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in no time Now we gotta wait 'til the clothes have gone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  I'll leave the lust with you, lost in the ocean Nobody knew what you're goin' through You talk about it as if I chose you Take a breathe and grace following with you  I'll flick a finger Before the magic to do his thing, yeah There's more than sadness we got within us Let's put some color into the grey  And drop the needle on Dusty Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night, but I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in no time Now we gotta wait 'til the clothes have gone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty  Up in the stairs the stereo follows Moved on the edge to throw it all away I used to think whatever situation stays the same But I can see it's goin' to change, okay  I'll drop the needle on Dusty Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night, but I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in no time Now we gotta wait 'til the clothes have gone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty I drop the needle on Dusty I drop the needle on Dusty I drop the needle on Dusty
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖👍😊
0:31 For some reason, I was thinking Ed is gonna pull John Cena's move here 😂
Ed and Lyra in 3 years 🥹
Dusty is the Small Bump of what could have been IMO and im crying over here ... so heartfelt.
Congrats for being not a song stealer
Must be weird doing this kind of video with someone else's daughter...
Thank you for your songs, you are a wonderful person, my 3 year old WORSHIPS you- he 'plays' your songs on  his uke and sings like all the time and everywhere! He even dresses like you ;) we have so much fun with your music, once again- thank you for that!

May God bless everyone reading this may your dream come true like #Edsheeran
❤❤
I absolutely love this music video!!! ❤❤
This song just made me feel a lot of emotions🥺
I don't know if anybody wants to hear this but let me say it to everyone reading.. Don't stop grinding and hustling until you feel fulfilled, it's not all about been on top, the highest thing is just to feel fulfilled as you. Love yourselves and believe in yourselves because that's what will fuel your energy each time you feel like giving up. I don't have so many subscribers but the ones I have are so special to my struggle so far. I'm grateful they believe in me, they're the reason i will keep putting in my best ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you so much for giving us a little view in your life. Such great Video and song❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ed is trolling 😂
this is so wholesome 🥺🥺🥺
Felt like I was there.  Onya.   🛀 I haven't had a bath in 3 days.   Muuuuum 🐥
You are the beeest! Thank you for everything! I love u!!!
God bless 🙏everyone who watches this Video and also Ed Sheeran and his staff for their work 😍💖❤
I love this song and video! So so beautiful, as always 😍 going to watch this so many times! It's nice to see him having fun with his daughter ❤
I love this song very much I'm damas from Tanzania.big up much Ed Sheeran
Who is that kid
🇩🇿👑🏃🏻
thi sis such a sweet music video
This one’s gonna age well ❤️‍🔥
Beautiful 🎉❤
Ed Sheeran doesn't sing song He tells story
AMAZING ED!!   I saw your 4-part mini-series and see the tragedies in your life. You have to count your blessings and focus on the blessings in life, not what you've lost.  You have Millions of adoring fans that appreciate your talent like me. Be glad your wife's cancer is remission. Be glad you have the money to control and care for your loved ones that are alive today. You have a wife it sounds like she wants you to spend quality time with. She wants you to stop hurting and ease your pain.  It appeared you don't open up to her about your grief of your friend and your depression. If you can't open up to her, maybe get a therapist for help. we all need it; we've all had bumps in the road, including me, where we need to get help. It's normal. Don't lose her. You also have 2 healthy children.  You have a family now. Instead of touring ...  I suggest, like other stars like Adel, set up residency in Las Vegas. Raise your kids there. That way we can come to see you. You can live a normal family life by day. Spend time with your family. then work a few hours by night a few nights a week. The stage is set up and you don't need a crew. People like me that love your talent and music will come and see you.
I love the opening of this song! Cute.❤🎉
a soothing, sweet song
Your music is the best love from belgium
Is that his real daughter ?
Suicide effects so many people. We are left with so many questions Why didn't I? I should have known? Was it my fault? How could they? But it's not your fault!!!!!! You have loved and Lost and you have  so much to live for. Don't be a statistic ❤❤❤❤
Is this you and one of your daughters just chilling?
Awesome ❤
Надеюсь вкусненько вам?👍👍👍
جيت بدري
😎💓😎💓😎
This video makes so much fun to watch 🤗
Soooo good good!!!!! Love Dusty Springfield 💥💥🇬🇧🇺🇸
Dusty is my my first favorite of this new album!! Family is everything! This song and video made my heart happy. ❤️
On first time through the video collection, this song is the one that puts the biggest smile on my face... even if it's just to educate the younger generation about Dusty.
😍😍😍😍😍😍 LOVE!!

Ed tells stories in his songs
1:50 I suppose anyone who's ever written a song will try to sue him for that progression too. I really hope he wins against Marvin Gaye's Estate. It is absolutely ridiculous!
Another great video and song! Buddy been grinding!

So cute ❤😅
This song was published 25minutes ago, but there are comments from 2 days ago?
Hopefully no one will claim copyright again
Thx!!!
29 min ago and early
People haven't even yet had the courage to admit the truth. Everyone denies the truth. I will never anyway expect the truth from cheap people. And those who does apologize, don't really apologize, they are sorry for themselves for being caught. I will never allow anyone who tried to fool me to TRUST them in the future again. Sharon Coetzee. 👑🇿🇦
💛💛💛💛 I love this album
Another beautiful one!
Ed is not just a Singer. He is a story teller ♥️♥️

Lyrics here: I heard you callin', now my eyes were open babe The day's breaking in the powder blue Sunlight's framin' now in every mornin' What a way to start off the day with you I'll flick a finger I start a discussion to pick a singer This one will do, I had to bring her Just at the speaker, still give away And drop the needle on Dusty Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night, but I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in no time Now we gotta wait 'til the clothes have gone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty I'll leave the lust with you, lost in the ocean Nobody knew what you're goin' through You talk about it as if I chose you Take a breathe and grace following with you I'll flick a finger Before the magic to do his thing, yeah There's more than sadness we got within us Let's put some color into the grey And drop the needle on Dusty Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night, but I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in no time Now we gotta wait 'til the clothes have gone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty Up in the stairs the stereo follows Moved on the edge to throw it all away I used to think whatever situation stays the same But I can see it's goin' to change, okay I'll drop the needle on Dusty Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere A beautiful smile on your face Yesterday was a long night, but I got a feeling that the future is so bright All of the pressure washed away in no time Now we gotta wait 'til the clothes have gone dry So I'll drop the needle on Dusty I drop the needle on Dusty I drop the needle on Dusty I drop the needle on Dusty
you're top
ED SHEERAN NUNCA DECEPCIONA
Very cute video!  The little girl is so cute, but a little older than lyra.  But I could imagine Ed' and Cherry's daughters looking like her!  Very cool song.

Wow, Ed Sheeran has done it again! "Dusty" is such a beautiful and heartfelt song. The lyrics are so raw and emotional, and his vocals just hit you right in the feels. It's amazing how he manages to capture so much depth and meaning in his music. I can't stop listening to this song on repeat, and I know it's going to be on repeat for a long time. Ed Sheeran truly is a musical genius!

รักทุกเพลงที่คุณร้อง❤😊
have loved u since "thinking out loud", loving subtract now💛
Nice song Sounds like ed sheeran 🙂 Nothing like your kids to heal whatever pain you have. My 2 boys are so special to me but little girls are special. Today is my first time seeing my beautiful daughter in 2 weeks. While I was getting 2 operations her mom wouldn't ring once to let me hear her. You'd think someone who's becoming a counsellor would understand. Bonnie I adore you I'm here for you though your with me now I'll let this here for you for the future. I absolutely adore you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🌟💛💪✨👑👏

What a beautiful song he wrote for his daughter, finding a vinyl in this case Dusty Springfield and dropping the needle on it and listening to it with his daughter how lovely.
