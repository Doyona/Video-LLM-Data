what other cartoon-related video ideas would you guys like to see?
There a man behind u…
✝️
I think all of them are good but the steven universe one
BLM doesn’t care about racism, only buying mansions with the money they made from racism they claimed to fight against
I feel genuinely so ill at the fact that we even need tv shows to teach about things such as racism, homophobia, sexism etc. Grown adults can be that disgusting towards other people for simply being different that we need a cartoon character to teach our children its okay to be different.
Why is Danny DeVito in the back?
Sound cloud got me like 💀🍆💦🥵
Omg foley is the last name of my history teacher
This was recommended to me and is a really great video. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is my favorite sitcom and not only that episode shown here is fantastic but so are others - highly recommended to watch!
Chick-fil-A sauce. Go on to everything trend?😂😂😂😂just joking PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.❤
You remind me a lot of turkey tom with the intro drawing
I fail to see how that episode of Arthur was about racism
If you’re against these episodes then you have a problem yourself
16:02 it does
That would be embarrassing having to say that when you aren’t racist in real life
I love your videos
Shows like Static Shock and Teen Titans really do tackle Racism really do tell just how good a message an episode targeting this subject can tell.  And then there’s Garnet’s “Don’t be racist.” That one is just dumb.
I watched That’s So Ravin lamao
16:24 WHAT IS THAT IM SCARED. ITS THE FACE AND THEN THE SILLY EARS. 💔💔💔
Please SOMEONE SELL ME EARL 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🏼
I find it so hard to understand the thought process of racism. Not *why* it happens, a majority of the time it comes with poor upbringing. But hating another person because of how they were born is so alien to me. It's horrible, and I'm glad children are being taught by shows that it's wrong.
I like how those two kids were like "let's get married" and then that girl comes in and we think they're gonna do some gay bashing but it's because racism?? Like that's wild. They could've tied both in. I did think it was kinda cute tho. I can see why some people wouldn't.
I don’t think bro knows what a cartoon is…
I feel that cartoons from the 90s and 2000s handled racism better that today's cartoons. Today's cartoons are too overly blantant and often send the wrong message like in the Proud Family reboot that heavily implied that black people aren't capable of being racist, and that white people are the only people in the world to be racist
id like a video on drugs in cartoons
Racism has become so far removed in our society it's pretty difficult to portray it in a realistic manner
The Steven Universe one is so funny. I can't believe it's official.
the steven universe one was sooooo cringe and forced. taking a good show and forcing a message (that it already wrote well) and wrote it badly
OK, do I need to go back and watch that episode of Sesame Street was too young to watch it when the year given I was only six months in one day old so I was just focusing on growing basically but now that I’m in my thoroughly 30s push in 32 1/2 years I think it’s about time I go back and watch that episode
I highly recommend reviewing the Teen Titans episode “Troq” about an alien that lands on Earth and is very nice to the rest of the Titans but harbors a lot of prejudice against Starfire.
it's garnet! from Steven universe!
Racism approached in cartoons...  Half the shows are live action.  Never stop doing this.
The Steven Universe one is so rough to watch. Misses every shot it takes.
You like cartoons man?
Wow bro, i didn't know sesame street, thats so raven, AND fresh prince are all 2D cartoons. That's craaazy
X men 92 and X men evolution tackled racism in form of the mutant registration act arcs, Captain Planet also did a racism episode andFamily Matters did a racial profiling episode
6:10 My ad here was unfortunate “Showing a little girl placing a rose on a tombstone…” “BLUEYYY!”
stevwn universe gonna always b my goat
The original Steven Universe ones we're less effective because it boiled down to the gems chastising kids (despite being colonizers). Whereas the other examples were more nuanced and focuses on how characters we love react and cope with discrimination.
Exodus 20:7
Ben Carson is one of my heroes
18:49 JAR responded...oh how he turned out to be in the end. Kinda tainted everything he defended ultimately...
How is Fresh Prince a cartoon tho lol
No mention of "The Sneetches"?
The Steven Universe PSAs are fine it’s just Garnet going “Kids, don’t be racist” gives me the same energy of “Don’t be racist, I am a building.”
i'm new here is the person in the background normal?
Me crying because of cartoon kid confronting racist dad: Me laughing 20 seconds later at armadillo and wolfman antagonists:
Little kids say "Let's get married when we're older" all the time to anyone they're friends with. How did that detract from the BLM discussion? It's kids?
18:33 WHAT??? XD
16:42 So...Prinipacal goes "Yep" I'lkl get that going" like John Lewis forced her to acknowledge it or I'm missing something here
12:53 DUDE DID YOU NOT LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID???
10:37 Telly's excitement bro XD
4:51 HOW THE BARK DID YOU NOT KNOW AFTER 7 BARKING EPISODES???
Video starts at 2:02
I don't think morbid is the word I'd use to describe a gun PSA that depicts a girl placing a rose on a tombstone.
the steven universe one tried but it failed because it also introduced a gay couple, which took away the highlight of the message
9:07 "I'll turn down *a thousand* black people before I let this company die!"
8:13 I know this is supposed to be a serious moment (by this show's standards), but the over-the-top manner this character says it cracks me up - she looks like my ex lip-syncing a voice clip on TikTok.
7:50 OMG, I remember this episode! Or more specifically, the subplot with Corey. I remember mentions of Jesse Owens and Sojourner Truth in particular, and I was tryna put my finger on what those two have in common because I clearly zoned out when it was brought up.
7:38 Fun fact: Raven-Symoné voiced one-off character Katie on _American Dad,_ who Francine bars from entering the Smith house for being left-handed, but because Katie is black, the rest of the family thinks Francine is racist until she explains the situation.  Also another fun fact: Katie's design, for those who remember what she looks like, actually inspired my own character, Maya Fonseca, protagonist of my webcomic _That Kid Maya._ Now, will I be tackling race issues? I currently have no plans to, but I'm open to it as long as I do the proper research, at least.
4:32 Wait, that's his *mum?* I thought she was his sister, because she's looking pretty fine for being in her... 30s, I think?
There’s two racism episodes Fresh Prince did. The other one was Will and Carlton trying to get into a black fraternity and Will is accepted but the head guy doesn’t want Carlton because “Carlton isn’t black enough and is a sellout to his people”   Both leave and it ends very much the same way as the first one and it shows that racism can happen even amongst “your own” just because you’re “not acting like they’re supposed to be acting”
If you want to do this topic again, 'Troq' from 'Teen Titans' is a really good episodes. It ends on the absolute perfect note.
Did you know they put pride month in the episode😊
9:45 tell me thats not the actual title of the episode 💀
bro is one of the most reconizable youtubers with 2,5 subs
am i the only one who is concerned about the elderly man in the backround?
Honestly theres a few shows here in Australia that have a few times looking at racism or I guess more like xenophobia if anything, original Heartbreak High is one that comes to mind.
I FCKING LOVE THAT'S SO RAVEN😝
Who's in the back of the room
Ah, the classic tuv
What the meme
BEHIND YOU!
Yes, I can relate to the That's so Raven episode in which I applied for a job and I was not hired for a job because I was a girl or would not hire me due the way to the way I was dressed. It is nice that cartoons cover topics such as racism but in a more kid-friendly way.
"black people can't marry white people" no boys shouldn't marry boys, wrong issue
6:19 😂😂😂😂 “oh!! Hey YouTube”
wow that episode of authur is awesome
4:18 all i can think of when i see this frame is a comment that said richie looks like a bored ape NFT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
who could forget the teen titans episode troq  OF COURSE I DO I'M HALF ROBOT
who is the persen on the bed
I'm not really a die-hard Steven Universe fan, but I have to defend it for a second. Those shitty PSAs probably weren't made by the original creator, Rebecca Sugar. For one, CN has been airing the gay marriage during pride month, even though they didn't renew SU because of it. But most importantly, Rebecca is ethnically Jewish and has a black partner. She would know better than to make something  that bad.
“this is a toddler’s show” nah this is peak cinema
4:48 miles morales' dad meets mr incredible
11:51  look at these dumb comments...
I saw a Family Matters episode about school shooting once
Why was I running around😭🙏
The last one is very gaysexual
Racism are just normal scenes in Family Guy 😂
🎵🎶 We have to celebrate our differences 🎶🎵 😂🤣
12:01  the way I screamed and look im 12 and my mom grew up watching this but she had me grow up on this show and it fully prepared for the reality of the world and not like the other kids my age especially now because im Hispanic and because the majority of my school are white and trump voters now they have been very racist to me and my friends and I have been going through it very well but all the teachers whom favor these kids have grudges against me and says my kind are illegal immagrants and should not be in this kind of school and it’s gonna be hard for my younger family members because they don’t know how to deal with this and it’s abosutily heart wrenching to se my cousins crying to me over the phone saying how it’s unfair and them being left out at play time
Bruh... seriously? There's racism in Steven Universe now? What the heck were the creators are thinking.
Why am I just finding out about this today? This was a very informative video, and it just goes to show that unless we all do something here and now, we’ll never be able to eradicate racism or bigotry in general.
What the hell is black history month bruhh?
Great shows like Static Shock on Kids WB were a lifesaver in the bleak summer of 2003 when my mother made the horrible, life altering decision to get rid of cable TV. I think I honestly watched WB more than Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and Disney even when we got it back.
Literally every YouTube video gets some dislikes even if super popular, so I don’t think the ones on the second Steven Universe video are really that noteworthy if they’re firmly in the minority.
"Kids, Dont. Be. Racist." -Garnet
the guy in the back scared me 😂
He got Arthur wrong, Arthur Takes a Stand was actually released in America around February 2018, not 2017😅
4:26 Imagine if Max said that to his dad Goofy about what he said about PJ
I feel so bad for minorities I’m Latino but I easily pass for a White man so I’ll probably never have to deal with racism
Tuv please come back to these types of videos, the nostalgia is quite literally killing me.

Not tryna be,”that guy”, but every time Steven universe came on I would cringe. But  Garnet got a gyatt's
Bro this vid is ancient. Anyone else here in 2113
These aren't all cartoons though, so the title is misleading. Good video though.
This video is really well made, just wish it had the one “Troq” episode from Teen Titans
well that was gay.
static shock did it the hard way and i love it they really told us to stop racism and i'm proud of that
It’s important that cartoons addresses these issues
some of these arent even cartoons, change title
18:25 ITS FAKE!!! BE RAYCIST
As a black guy and Christian I find cartoons today for kids is suit full with gay stuff and just pure slop
Im a HUGE Steven Universe fan, and even i think the first PSA is cringy. I havent seen the 2nd one they uploaded, gonna go watch it now.
Who's the guy behind you
3:23  as soon as I heard that scentence my prediction was that his parents were racist and despised black people
Somehow teen titan showing racism was so good
Nobody:  Garnet: Don't be racist!
Who's the guy in the background tav?
18:35 made me crack up idk why 😭
Static Shock was absolutely amazing. And that episode in particular struck home with me. While none of my family is racist, my best friend is black, and he wasn't familiar with my family before when I invited him over for the first time. That episode showed me a "what if" scenario. And it was... eye opening that this kind of thing does happen. A lot.
Do a video on the momo challenge hoax ?
Honestly when I first saw that short I thought it was going to say boys can’t marry boys
Pp
Somewhat related to this, another cartoon that fits in this category is My Little Pony. I know it's to be expected in a show that teaches friendship to kids, but the show writers did it in a different and more symbolic way than the ones mentioned in this video. They used nonhuman characters with differences representative of humans but without actually labeling them as such.   My Little Pony has multiple episodes where one or multiple characters express racism towards other species only to realize that those feelings are shallow and baseless after one or multiple experiences with a member of those species (ex. "Hearths Warming Eve" and "Bridle Gossip"). It's less about the presence of racism in societies and more about the fallout, how preconceived ideas about groups are often wrong and that labeling all members of a group a certain way always leads to incorrect perceptions and assumptions, which I thought the show writers did a good job at depicting.  Kids don't understand the complexities of real-world racism and how harmful it can be, so they're less likely to be able to sympathize with what they see in shows with humans. But with racial conflicts between groups of characters (like unicorns and pegasi and earth ponies) telling the same story about how judging others based on arbitrary characteristics can be harmful, children are able to grasp that concept and understand why it's a bad thing. And I think it's important that they're taught this way because they learn to sympathize with people in the real world who may face discrimination, just as they saw in My Little Pony with the ponies' negative reaction to seeing a friendly zebra character for the first time.  This isn't to say that racism approached in cartoons with humans isn't effective, just that I believe it's easier for children to understand when the characters aren't given human characteristics and therefore take the lessons at face value. My Little Pony is genuinely a great show that's done a good job at showing heavy issues such as racism and even self-harm at one point.  I didn't mean to write so much here but I feel as though the writers have approached these topics well and definitely deserve to be recognized :]
This dude is Not an aardvark, wheres his long claws, wheres his long ears, wheres his pig like nose. If u ask me he looks more like a kappybara
17:19 did you just say that Steven universe feature is a SPINOFF!?
18:51 didnt age well
Not gonna lie, I thought the Steven universe one was not real😭😭😭
No way steven universe said that black is not allowed to marry people that's crazy 💀
Why does Jon Louis look like giga chad 💀
Whos grandpa is in the corner of your room
I dont want to sound cringe or desperate, but is rasicm only directed to black people? I mean, I'm asian and I experienced (still do) some sort of rasicm...
It’s crazy how Cartoon Network trying to make a racism psa just made a meme instead
3:59 Eminem. (He listens to his own music and makes his music)
Raven's home has a future plot to
Rip John Lewis fly high🕊️
old shows had the better understanding of it, those shows showed how bad it is and got to the serious problems and didn't dumb it down for kids And it also showed the everyday problems that people face. Newer shows do that exact same thing but do it for...quirkiness?
I have never watched ur videos before but that man in the back scared me
Why is no one talking about the man in the back I’m a first time watcher….
But what about Thomas and Friends. Thomas was racist when he said something very racist in Misty Island Rescue
where’s moral orel? 💔🥀  it may not be a kids show but it’s a cartoon 😔  anyways, in all seriousness there’s nothing wrong with the SU one. people are gonna be homophobic and racist. they’ll use any excuse to hate on either group just because and i’ll never understand why :/
“I used to think racism didn’t affect me”   … Greg ur literally Jewish
i honestly think racism is stupid. everyone on earth is a human. i seriously dont get why everyone isnt treated as suck
Fun fact Virgil’s father is voice by Dave fennon (sorry if I got his last name wrong 5:13
So just because it's animated means it has to be fictional, and shouldn't be approaching anything serious whatsoever? That intro is worse than the Oscars at handling animation.
you should include Spongebob SquarePants' Season 2 Episode 11: Squirrel Jokes
LMAO only on 4:00 I noticed that... Creepy mannequin (or is that a real person) behind you.
There was also CApitol Critters where mice lived alongside with cockroaches (who were actually fine), but many mice hated them just because they were cockroaches. That was an obvious representation of Racism, although I can't call Capitol Critters a cartoon for children xD
18:09 I feel like the bully kid is more likely to bully them for being gay then the color of their skin :p
Fine shyt
Not all white people are racist
why steven universe got so much dislikes is because how they portrayed racism they just made it blatantly corny and just plain lame.
5:12 “stop it” McDonald drug add ahh voice☠️💀
15:20 am i the only person that could hear the theme in their head💀
I'm whit and I love rap
do you think you can do one on same sex love?
I just learned that fresh prince is a cartoon
Bro he cannot be cancelled the fan art had him at the EDP location and later in the video we wake up on top off him.
i watched that episode of fresh prince with my cousin. He’s like carlton, and i’m like will in the sense of perception. he grew up in NC while i was born and raised in Texas. the thing that grinded my gears is that he doubted that happens but immediately shut him down telling him that almost happened with my dad because im significantly lighter than him. needless to say, there’s a reason why i don’t associate with that part of my family
0:23 is that Josh Dun?
You know youve messed up when you have 125K dislikes 4:25 thats just messed up.. THE father was racist to his SONS FRIEND.
That's just what they do in Arthur when there's a real person. They make them realistic XDD
Yall havent seen caillou racism
I really really hate racism!!!!
Tuvington!!
Your cardboard cut out, scare the death out of me several times 💀
Is that a real man in the corner or a mannequin? I always get this scary thought that he's some stranger in your house and you're somehow fine still making videos Like if I were you I would freak out screaming loud enough for neighbors to invite the cops if that person in the corner is real which I hope not I'm sorry for hoping that but I'm also sorry but he just freaks me out not in a rude way if he is real I'd like to know who he is
12:14 I mean you gotta admit  Will Smith plays a good Will Smith
Your face is beautiful
The boys weren't gay in the Steven universe PSA they were acting the role. But Garnet kinda hinted that they might have a future together in a timeline as they get older because of her future vision but the white boy felt embarrassed and awkward maybe because he wasn't thinking about being with another boy at the time signifying that he might not be gay now but he could be in the future. Or the boy was secretly gay and didn't want to be outed at that moment Lol. 😅  Also i find it funny that the PSA was about Race and not two underage boys talking about getting married one day. It's two subjects but only focused on one. Gay and Race tolerance is fine to promote but don't just brush out one subject because most people especially now aren't going to care about the interracial love aspect of the PSA they would think about the fact it's too young boys acting like gay lovers on screen. If i was a parent i would be more concerned with anything showing any child boy or girl straight or gay holding hands or kissing or other more mature gesture and behavior with one another. At least that's my opinion and i can understand the view point of those who would disagree with such concerns but still. Other then that it's a lovely commercial.
This video must be at least 5+ years in the making for you to be able to see the number of dislikes. Nice! 😊 that takes me back... 🥹 0:17
I forget about this guy every time I look away from him
That first one was really good. I’ll have to check out Static Shock
That animal-human hybrid of John Lewis is fucking nightmare fuel.
10:40 Wasn't always specifically like that. Lol
When sesame street’s more mature than actual “mature content”
Colossians 3:8
ew, justarobot. stinky
Now let's talk about The Grinch because if you know you absolutely know. One of the most underrated and least talked about underlying adult messages ever.
You know what other shows did a good job on handling and explaining racism: Central Park. It was animated by the same people who made Bob's Burgers and they made an episode called Lunar Palaver to where he gave his son the "the talk" after he had a racist encounter with someone, and I personally think it did a good job on handling the issue, I remember getting the talk from family as I was getting older. So I highly recommend the episode.
I have seen a lot of "Arthur" but, why have I never seen the episode that confronts the reality of racism? Static Shock is one of my big time favorite shows. I pretty much missed out on the beginning part of the 90's and we had 2 tv's at the time (My Parents room and the Family room). I think John Lewis' representation of himself on Arthur I believe is supposed to be that of a Brown Bear or Black Bear.
What i respect about the Static Shock episode isnt just the fact it tackled a serious topic head on and not sugar coating it  Richie's dad isnt 100% changed at the end. Which is an extreme rarity in tv shows. Especially cartoons. It shows that serious problems take time to change and his dad shows signs he will try  Thats the most realistic way this sort od tbing has ever been done and while risky, is honest
I just want to comment that Arthur didn’t go to the principal. He went to the secretary.
As a kid, I really liked the Static Shock episode.
I will say there’s also another great episode from Fresh Prince about racism within your own race. And it has to do with Carlton, not being entered into a fraternity for “ not being black enough” it’s another great episode that articulates that racism comes in many forms, and you can even be between races internally as well.
Ok totally off topic. But the Danny davito caught me off guard 😂
the cut  out of danny devito  creep me out
I remember they did again  in the later season when they introduce  Ji-Young she was upset when another kid said go back to your country
Just fyi, on Arthur, all of the special guests had human faces lol. It helped viewers realize that this was in fact a special guest
Honestly just “treat others how you want to be treated” has worked for 27 years of my life. No history lesson, political reasoning, or entire class of theories.
I may not know what's going on but why is there a guy standing in the back😮 sorry I only just started this video and I'm not sure anyone knows I'm a little concerned is that okay😂 cuz I can see an old man in the back here and I don't know who he is or if he's supposed to be there
The mom aint so innocent idc if you arent racist if you stay with someone who is you are just as bad period
Also, the reason Steven Universe is LGBT friendly and is actually a good show is because the characters are actually likeable, whereas too many movies with LGBT characters tend to be written to where it sounds like the creators are trying to be all like "hey look at us, we're cool, we have diversity and inclusion! please like us!". Although I do kinda wonder sometimes, that if an entire race is made up of only a single gender, in the Gem's case, women, can they really be considered lesbian? I mean, I guess, since Rose fell in love with Greg, but im still not too sure
Is it racist if you are called racist for not watching some of these shows as a kid? Static, Raven, Fresh Prince (well, i saw more of this than the other 2) Cuz some time last year, I made mention that I didnt watch these shows as a kid cuz they just didnt appeal to me at the time or they were on at the same time I was either at school or a different show I liked was on, there werent any other reasons, and many people claimed I was racist because of my parents or something, and despite me saying that I was never told what not to watch other than one instance, where the only show during my childhood I was told I was forbidden to watch was Ed, Edd, 'n Eddy (cuz for some reason my mom thought that show was the reason I kept getting suspended from school) they still claimed i was racist. Words of dumb people i swear
I know it's not a cartoon, but the Disney channel movie The color of friendship was a huge deal for me. I grew up in a small town in Texas, I think I knew one black person the whole time I was there. My mom said they weren't allowed to buy land anywhere near where we lived. By the time I saw that movie I had already moved up to Seattle at about 11 years old, and I had no idea about most of what was mentioned in it. I just wanted to give it a shout out because that movie meant a lot to me.
In Fat Albert, they dropped the re- word.
17:16 Idk if it’s just me but I can hear this without the song
For the better part of TWELVE YEARS of being homeless I lived in a shelter with an atmosphere of "poor little blackie against horrible whitie", and EVERYTHING that doesn't go blackie's way is WHITIE'S FAULT 🤬‼️. So, which side is more racist?
I can't remember exactly what show it was.I think it was smart guy with the younger Mowry brother but on this show, the racist store manager lady justifies it by saying that she hired the older sister who is black but she still wants her to follow black customers around to make sure they don't steal anything. At the end a black gentleman comes into the store and the lady manager follows him around and it turns out that he was a general manager for the stores in that area that she works at.
I do believe you missed one good one. The episode where a new alien super hero showed up on T.T. and was being that way to Starfire.
Nga
No Arthur started in 1996 get it right like seriously
Still somewhat happens today racism it never ends which I hate it's one of the reasons why I have trust issues.
I just noticed the guy standing behind him..
Wow, at least they teach kids how to stand for racism these days
I used to watch Static Shock a lot when I was a kid, and as a white kid it was where I learned that racism was a thing, but surprisingly, I didn't learn about it from this episode!  You see, because Richie's dad being a racist was just something that I thought "okay, one bad person is a racist", just like how some bad people want to steal stuff. But there's an episode where Virgil goes to Africa with his family and he talks with Richie on the phone, he says to him "In the USA I'm a black kid, but here, I'm just a kid!". It really made me reflect on the implications of what he said, suddenly racism was a far more serious thing that was still an persisting issue, rather than just a dumb ideology of few bad people.  The episode also showed a lot of stuff about African culture and clothing! I loved watching it.
They should make episodes involving all sorts of racism toward various groups and not just one.  I’m Hispanic and experienced more racism from blacks or witness blacks say or do things towards other people because of their skin color.  I’m tired of blacks always being played out to be the victim when they are just as bad if not worse
Who noticed the person in the background
16:52 “and then john lewis spawns in.” got me crying a bit  where did bro spawn in from?
Who is that guy
Why every video needs a dorky narrator?
star vs deserves a mention on how it screwed it up.
Who’s that in the back
History of racism in classic cartoons makes a great subject
Loved the message episodes of static shock. the gun episode was quite emotional and the dyslexia and racism episodes were good too.
Racism isn't always targeted at black people. White people get discriminated against too ( you know, by black people.)
I hate racism with a passion
I am sure Steven's Universe was cool in the beginning, it's just when everyone started copying the show's art style.
Steven Universe actually tried it a third time, I liked the effort but they were putting black people up while also putting white people down... I don't think they should disrespect other races in a video about racism, I think they should put all races up
I'm white, and I openly like rap music. Come on, Eminem put out many good rap songs, including Survival, Mockingbird, and even Godzilla.
7:51 A FUCKING 500 PAGE ESSAY… FOR A CHILD.
Is that Danny devito in the back 😭😭😭
can we just normalize blowing raspberries at racist and karens lol
Why’s Corey writing a 500 page essay 😭😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽
I do like your face more no one should EVER be ashamed
Who at first thought the top left picture in the thumbnail was from Ozzy and Drix?
Are friend Martin was so crazy oh my god
Fresh Prince isnt a cartoon lmao
Wasn’t racism it was prejudice the whole reason he got his powers is cuz he was involved wit gang bangers. Weird racism baiting
Why is nobody talking about that man in the back?
Racism isn’t real.
It's just ignorance. Racism keeps going because we keep digging it up from the grave. Martin Luther King Jr worked hard for all different shades to be together and equal but now everyone wants to segregate again. It a disgrace to his memory and successes.
There was nothing wrong with those comments, they were true. Quit trying to make a certain group of people with a different shade of brown better than the others; throw ignorant thoughts of people away and just be people. There's twins that have different shades but no one talks about that.
i think the owl house making Belos' entire motivation being incredibly racist was pretty cool
Ain’t no one go talk about the man in the back of his room? I know it’s fake it looks so realistic and scary 😂.
Can we all talk about the dummy behind the guy?
2:08 hear me out..
Cartoon have been…. Something about topics like LGBTQ and gay or racism, I get it they do that and I do like it that they do talk about it and show a better way to fix it and show the person that that made or have the problem
1:00 GRANDPA?!
Yo am I the only 1 that never knew thats so raven had a racist episode 😮
2:00 where he stops yapping
Is that Danny DeVito in the back corner of that room?  It’s slightly startling!
I just want everyone to know that Jesus is coming back very soon!  Jesus loves you all.. He loves you so much that HE died for YOU on the cross (and rose again 3 days later) for your sins and paid the price of DEATH that we needed to pay! God is a just judge, but Jesus freely payed the price of the wages of OUR SIN which is death, destruction.. and eternal damnation!  CALL ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND YOU WILL BE SAVED!   . no matter what you're going through right now, I want you to know you are seen, acknowledged, and loved, and God has a wonderful plan for you in life, He will accept you.     For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son [Jesus Christ], that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” – John 3:16    Jesus, I believe you are the Son of God, that you died on the cross to rescue me from sin and death and to restore me to the Father. I choose now to turn from my sins, my self-centeredness, and every part of my life that does not please you. I choose you. I give myself to you
😭🙏 18:20
What about Rosita's accent episode?
Raven's home Booker gets pulled over
That Arthur episode that you talked about i remember it
used to watch super shock when i was younger, i dont remember shi, but there’s a scene where a kid in his school brings a gun and shoots a bully
why do you have someone’s grandpa in your room
I dig the video, but I gotta point out...The Fresh Price of Bel-Air was NOT a cartoon 😂
6:19 this story reminds me about a few weeks ago when i went to my friends house for a BBQ. I am black to be more specific Zimbabwean and my friend is white we really don't care how we look or how we sound at all. I an vert insecure about my accent so i thought when i went there to his house they would make a racists comment or joke which no mad besides his cousin who had kinda a trouble maker. I never had a bad experience with meeting white people they were so nice and polite like my friends family they didn't ask me much about my culture or skin just about my interests and school so i was comfortable around them.
The impact of that fresh price episode can not be overstated it was a beast
7:44 love it how while watching this video i got hit with an ad of an air hostess shouting at a black man in a plane💀
That Danny devito cutout in your room scared the shit out of me dude. Great video though ❤
A MAN BEHIND YOU
4:59 It cut to an ad perfectly at "He calls him an ignorant bi-" and I bust out laughing.  Edit: also, fun fact about Will Smith being called Will Smith on Fresh Prince: Alfonso Ribeiro suggested it to him, because everyone would always call him by his character name in real life. 👍 (Also, Sesame Street and Fresh Prince aren't cartoons lol)
1:48 based leafy
15:14 wrong Arthur aired in 1996 on PBS not 1994 tuv 👍❤️
Can you also make videos on how neurodivergence, and the LGBTQ plus community was approached, please?
No Caillou it has racist jokes too
i think elmo was the person in sesame street🤭
I will never forget the static shock episode where the dad finds out that he is static and he's a dad you knew and his dad looks right out of my ghost I see you everyday you really don't think I wouldn't know my son cause he put on a trench coat in a mask
The reason I don't get upset when static shock tackled racism me being white because it's shown that not every white person is a cross burning bigger and some of us are actually pretty loving and accepting people and it showed that people that are racist can very well change and they're not the stereotypical scooby doo villain like the most of the media is trying to make them out to be
w content👍
I find it so weird that Sesame Street got so much hate for simply acknowledging the fact racism exists
I remember when the coments were active in that steven universe psa, and most of the comments were complaning about stupid and idiot the commercial was and how it oversimplify the subject, like one coment say at the time ''oh was racist before but thanks to garnet saying to not be racist I stop it'' people think that the commercial was just too stupid, and again, similar to that parodic ''don't be racist I am a bilding meme'' but this time taken serious, also a lot of people have problems on why rebecca sugar like to put lgbt themes in everyhting but never discuss it, like she just talk about homophobia IN ONE SCENE in the entire series, with a major lgbt cast, this is percived as just ''tolkens'' for the lgbt community and that she is just triyng to hide the discussion and use lgbt agenda as a social aproval method by some people, I honestly think that the parents should talk about it with they kids about this because well I think this is a complex theme since there is religion involved with it
''lgbt friendly'' everbody in the cast is ''lgbt'' less the protagonist and also the gems don't have sex or genitals and somehow they still can be lgbt for some reason lol! and also they have the briliant idea to make the what was until the last episodes a literal reference to the nazis, the main villains of the series in the star wars reference way..... become good at the end just because they hug and exposed they feelings.... yeah this definally will work lol!
that steven universe ad is literally the ''don't be racist I am a bilding'' meme but this time taken 100% serious lol!
What about teen titans
that picture looks zesty at 35 seconds
I’m gonna say it, even though Mr. Enter already said it. Arthur talking about the George Floyd video was guaranteed to fail, for one pretty obvious reason. There are no people, let alone black people, in the series. The reason everyone is an animal is to make the concept of race irrelevant. That’s also why everyone has a different skin tone in Doug.
Why did I read the title as “Russian approached in cartoons” 💀
Static Shock aired in the early 2000s, not the late 2000s.
Who is that in your background
As usual, the default racists in all these examples are white people, and the default victims of racism are black people, or occasionally other non-white races. Typical BS narrative. Remind me, which countries are melting pots of diversity and inclusion? Oh that's right, the WHITE countries. And which countries are still racially homogenous? Oh that's right, the NON-white countries. So how are white people the official racists of Planet Earth? Take a look at the interracial violent crime rates to see who the real racists are.
Who's the guys it back 1:00 💀💀💀
It’s not good to show kids real world problems when there minds are not as developed but it is import to teach them to not be racist and give them a easy way to understand it and try not to be racist and nice to all races minds but yes to the cartoon directors out there please know that do not make real world problems on kids tv shows but maybe just make it seem like the villain is the racist person by making the bully in a show racist or being rude and mean towards someone who is a different race or has a disorder then make a very likable main character to help and stand up for them but ya if you are reading this please understand that it’s kinda weird and hard for kids to understand real world problems Ty for reading my long ahh sentence
Black people cant marry white people? Guess I gotta break the news to my white wife
8:13 lifetime black person here 👋🏾my thing is… why she say black like that? Whenever I hear someone mainly white say black that this, I automatically think they’re racist…
THe that's so is the only one I ever watched
John Lewis looks horrifying 😭😭😭
Is that a mannequin in the back ??? 🤔🤔
anyone thought the glove was a black hand?4:55
Perez Edward White Patricia Martin Daniel
Brown Barbara Thompson Lisa Walker Kenneth
people who noticed his freaky ahh grandpa in the corner💀💀💀
Who tf is that guy creeping out behind you!?!?
Lewis Dorothy Hernandez Linda Miller William
that steven universe one is so vile and disgusting. ofc the lgbtregime would put 2 little boys saying they want to get married. perverts all of them.
I’m sorry but  IS THAT BERTRAM IN THE BACK😭
The guy chillng in the background -
These shows tackled racism better than Proud Family: Louder and Prouder and Velma ever will.
When it comes to the steven universe psa's, I think they're fine for what they are.
11:43 YOUTUBE IS OFFICALLY NOT WITHIN ANY OF THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS TO DISABLE COMMENTS ON VIDEOS MARKED AS MADE FOR KIDS.
Why do I remember earl being a skate brand with like the exact same font
You forgot Barney's Great Adventure when Cody says "Want some stupid pretend game?"
I saw that arthur episode once as a kid
7:50
11:57 i think all lives matter (and yes, all lives matter means *everyone's* lives matter). With that aside, yeah, i do think most older cartoons handled the issue better rather than spreading political agenda from both sides of political parties.
Fun fact: when you press the like button it spews confetti
I thought the arthur one would be the knitter scene
If you ask me I loved the Teen Titans episode of how they talked about racism. Val-yor constantly called Starfire “Troq” and the other titans were oblivious by the name because they all thought it was a nickname since they all had one from Val-yor. It’s not until Cyborg says it not thinking much of it, and Starfire sculls him for it. She explains that when Val-yor calls her a troq he’s saying she is worthless. And I just love the ending of their conversation.  Cyborg: So he’s calling you a terrible name? And you know if you punch him out it just confirms all the bad things he says about you.  Starfire: Yes. You know what it feels like to judged simply because of how you look?  Cyborg: Of course I do. I’m part robot
I miss the old days when cartoons had a positive approach on handling racism. Nowadays shows like Velma, and Louder and Prouder tell their audience that it’s not okay to be white.
There's someone behind you... RIP
I don't see anything wrong with racism.
6:25 what did he do to him
What about when white people are a victim of racism. Does that not count? Is it one law for one race
I saw a meme abt the Steven universe of gay and racism
i still dont know what sesame street is what is sesame street???
Whos the guy in the corner standing up in the background of your video.
Not the ad placement-
Steven Universe bully looks like camp Camp character💀💀💀
Wait a minute do you see that guy behind TUV
Once You Mentioned The Car In The Fresh Prince Section I Immediately Went “Oh This Episode”😂
I didn't even know that's so raven was the prequel to ravens home
The only thing you got wrong about Fresh Prince is that Henry Firth is just Uncle Phil’s legal partner, not his boss.
I didn’t grow up in a racist area or school. But it was a “rich” Christian middle school, so the majority of kids were white. I can name on only two hands the amount of black kids that there were at the school during all my years there, and I remember all of them. I think all the classes (up to 8th grade) combined were maybe 200 kids. I wish everyone in the school learned more about racism, none of us were racist, but I don’t really feel that we were educated enough.
Wow, if every episode of Static Shock is like that, I think the writers need a raise. The dad's racism was very subtle, and not forced down your throat like the Steven Universe one. It carefully builds up to the friend confronting his dad, and his dad having this great arc at the end. It barely even felt like a special episode. That could've been just a normal episode and still would've been beautifully written.
You do know what a cartoon  is right? 3 cartoons(correct), 1 childs programming(not a cartoon) 1 tv show(not a cartoon).
Elemental is actually full of that if you think about it.
Bro I remember the Steven Universe R@<ism got turned into a meme
No gonna notice that old man in the background standing like a statue?
6:25 i wish i was that earl plush
0:16 i think  cuz the boys were gay and parents do not want gay
I honestly like the original version version of the Disney Channel series Proud Family episode when Penny Proud(main character in the series) goes into an exchange program with an Arabic family that practices Islam. One of the scenes the Arabic family house got vandalized and the word terrorist was sprayed painted.Penny experienced racism and Islamophobia in the episode. I found it great since Islamophobia was big in the 2000s when 9/11 and Iraq war impact America.
My friend said white can’t love black people I told her they can and told her about what happened back in the old days.
At 15:15 Arthur did not start in 1994,the show started in 1996!
10:34 not really a fart sound! More like a blowing raspberries sound as in to say “Get lost you racist fool!”
I’m surprised that Thomas & Friends did not have any racism episodes in Big World Big Adventures! They should have still continued in the original series!
I think star vs the forces of evil did a wonderful job with talking about racism and they weren’t upright about it. I think the mewmans and monsters was a wonderful way to show kids not to treat people different based on who they are
I saw this on pbs!!!!
The fact that he can't see the person behind him in the corner tho😂😂😂
Static shock and Arthur go hard🔥🔥🔥🔥
Watch "Solving Rascism" it's from that rabbids show
tuv cartoon oiled up gyat 4k HD
Forgot about the Steven Universe movie!
Fun Fact: Nicki Minaj and Joan Jett both made cameos in steven universe. And estelle voiced garnet!
Static shock and Steven Universe are two of my favorite tv shows of all time along with a bunch of animated tv shows!
0:01 TIMMY TURNER
I honestly laughed when the bully karate, chopped kids holding hands 😅 😂 it’s just such a bully thing to do
So … how did that anonymous person get the phone number on Sesame Street ?
The inclusion of the boys being LGBT in the PSA was not a distraction at all. If anybody found it so shocking that it distracted them, then that speaks volumes.   Tell it how you mean it. Say what you actually mean, guys. 💀 You don't like seeing LGBT in media. Hope that helps.
"That's So Raven" was a huge part of my childhood, I remember how much of an impact this made!
The man standing in the back is so still 😂
Holy molehhhh
Why was Earl under the covers??
The Golden Palace also tackled this too with a episode about Blanche’s traditions of her family with the confederate flag
1:06 the character looks like tomdark but the upgraded version
I saw an old man behind you
18:15  What The Hell Is This Bs 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
theres a man behind you
there is no such thing as an 'inferior race' if youre a gypsy
I loved these shows as a kid, And seeing them tackle Real world issues is honestly a great way to teach kids, especially how they tackle Racism.  I wish there was no racism….Everyone is equal.
Yooo
The steven universe racist ad is literally me bashing on the Tom Holland x Zendaya relationship in the MCU which pissed me off.
What kind of teacher would give a kid Corey's age a 500 page essay to write on one topic?  That's not an essay; that's a biography that costs several hundred dollars in printer cartridges!
Racism is not only for whites and black
suggestion:character design done right
Another show that handled it well was  the original Proud Family
That's So Raven was my FAVORITE show growing up. I remember when that episode aired!
Is it just me, but who is that in the background of the video standing and staring straight at the camera  ?
I saw a man in his room
Fresh Prince has the most realistic animation I've seen in a cartoon jesus christ, almost looks like live action oh wait
uh did nobody realize how the blond manager sounds like the racist or mom on Dhar man like WTF with the raven show
9:30 How old are you? 11:56 How is that wholesome?! 14:40 No? That has nothing to do with it. This is also weird because they can’t see who is driving at night …. So like … what? 12:46 I know what they were going for but it just made this interaction extremely unnatural  15:00 sure it is Jan. It is not “real life” and I think you’re over extrapolating a lot. 18:50 um they weren’t though so what are both of you talking about? 19:17 lmao “real world matters” I still think it wasn’t done right because of the feeling of condescension. 19:28 wait wha? An ally to wholm? 19:30 pfft! I can’t! It just went the complete *_opposite_* direction and yeah they tried to correct it but it didn’t land well. Most pudding people may not grasp it.
5:28 no? 5:46 No and no 8:39 I think that’s the point. It’s throwing him off so it should throw us off too. 16:40 for me it was the reason not so much the method that irked 18:00 I don’t think that’s what happened in relation to what the girl said. Like she totally would’ve said something else. Also, if this is for kids, what is it released on YouTube? I know kids watched YouTube but I think this is a questionable ad to have. And I thought YouTube kids didn’t have adverts. But then again. Stephen universe isn’t even for kids so like wot? 18:29 he is technically right though. I’m not sure why or how the other kid would know or have an experience to tell but a play by play of that scene they did would not actually happen. And kinda sus how it got locked into YouTube kids but I guess cartoons = kids? That’s scary. I know they are supposed to be kids in it but still.
17:32 um what? No it wasn’t. O mean… it wasn’t UNfriendly but that is straight up coming out of left field
8:23 😂😂
Top 10 dbz your favorite episode.
something about your characters bulging eyes scares me in every way possible
the celebrities always get a very human face on arthur
Racism makes me sick,  I will stand up and fight against racism, ❤💛🤎🖤🤍 ALL LIVES MATTER✊️
TSR and TFPB are NOT cartoons. Could've wrote shows instead
I actually got to meet Static's voice actor, Phil LaMaar at a convention a while back. Loved talking with him about his various roles :)
18:15  GAY
umm call me crazy but im pretty sure sesame street isnt a cartoon (Joke)
6:18 i thought smth else was going on, not a merch promo lol
Right wingers: Dis Is WoKe!!! Grrrr
I love how wholesome static shock is
I'm surprised that Family Matters wasn't mentioned! There was an episode where Laura was petitioning to have a black history course in her school. There were scenes where someone spray painted the N-word on her locker. Segregation between the students, and when Estelle was telling Laura about how she was able to obtain a library card from a whites only library.
Fesh Pince ob Blair.
damn, TSR cancelled somebody before cancelling was a thing.  ROFL
Autism?  I used to be the same way.
someone make an edit of this man pls
Raven’s home episode: in one episode, booker is driving a car owned by I think Chelsea. He is racially profiled by the cop and is taken to jail.  Eveyerbody hates Chris: Chris is arrested because they think he’s the man who hijacked the cookie truck because he’s black
I just love racism!
"calculated propaganda to undermine liberty in the minds of children!!! *snorts*" girl the show is made for a fetus not a full grown adult
18:19 cause your gay 💀💀💀
how did you get the dislike count
As a white child in a mixed neighborhood, I had the meanest crush on Richie from Static shock 😂 I legit thought he was cool and amazing.
Cartoon  you has a Scott pilgrim art style I like it
8:13 Dang, Racist Much?
There's something on ur right
I think this is wrong, a lot of the kids who are watching these shows are toddlers and they won’t understand
How about the mutant registration arc in X men and X men evolution
I don’t want to make a huge argument defending it, but I think the backlash to the Garnet anti racism PSA was kinda overblown. It wasn’t a great PSA by any means but I think it’s main issue is that it was kinda just too over simplified if that makes sense? I’ve seen a couple of the other ones (I think there’s like 4 or 5) and they were actually pretty decent,  all things considered. I think people on twitter were possibly just getting mad over nothing like they tend to do sometimes.
Bro said contracted superpowers like it’s AIDS
Mouse.AVI
My nephew is a fan of Steve universe and he doesn’t care about the lgbt stuff cause he watches for the fun of it
Who is the guy behind u
With the Cops
I hate that episode of fresh prince of bel air because Carlton was just making a joke of what Will had to face when he was younger in the show but it doesn’t explain why
oh wow
Old disney cartoons: *Crying in a corner*
Really making me feel old when you say I was too young when Fresh Prince came out so I never saw it lol.
you remind me of derek gerard in the best way possible
sometimes unintentional remarks on racism in cartoons are better. i remember watching Teen Titans Go and Starfire was upset about how people treated her differently because she was an alien. Cyborg entered the room and comforted her and told her about how he understands how she feels because he is half robot and people treat him badly because of that. i know it’s not the exact same, but it shows the same concept and i thought it was quiet smart and well done!
Only Ogs Know QuackyStacky
I hate how realistic the danny devito is in the background its so menacing
2:52 that’s what I always say
i wonder why richie’s mom stayed with her husband while watching that episode. unless she can’t support herself theres no other reason i can think of her wanting to stay. maybe to make richie happy? she’s clearly on her son’s side, not her man’s.
2:51 EXACTLY!! I can still see your whole face.
Is that your dad or grandpa in the back?  Or what?
the arthur episode was based off the greensboro four, four black college students who were at a restaurant and were rejected service, ending up in a protest in the form of staying seated, as arthur and his friends did
Your character looks like a character from the Scott Pilgrim comics lol
The Guy At The Back💀💀💀 (Idk If That's A Picture Or A Dummy But I Thinks A Person)
She’s fine gays, but blacks can’t get married to white people.
I swear when the Steven Universe PSAs came out I thought they were good bc I was hyperfixated on it at the time they came out but why were they so goofy 😭😭
I loved the memes from the black people cant marry white people
Diarrhea
Uh, who's that rotund guy in the corner of your room?
"Kids... BE RACIST!" -Garnet
this is my first vid from you and it was great! i will say while i like the idea of you splitting the format 50/50 between your face and character i think you could definitely use more expressions! the transitions between different shows being discussed while the fade out is kinda awkward with the open mouth expression and the moment of silence. overall the video is still edited very well, im excited to look at more of your content in the future!
Amazing video.
Nah this man randomly appeared on my fyp and he's now one of my favorite YouTubers
Did anybody notice the old  man standing in the background?
7:45 I would want to write 500 pages either 😂
The reason why people responded negatively to the newer cartoons approach to racism is because it's like they were made like they were diversity training videos for Google employees. What the Steven Universe PSAs and the Sesame Street "Summer of Love" segments were emotional labor, not teaching the viewer a life lesson through good storytelling.
That BLM PSA kinda had some hints of homophobia
0:45 Bro Da Man In Dabakrund Is Cripin mi awt
The sesame street issue has to do with BLM not it talking about racism to children that's where the dislikes come from considering in all honesty BLM has caused more destruction and chaos then justice and good talk about billions in damages from sparking riots damaging properties and businesses that had nothing to do with it and it also stole a lot of money from people who were trying to do something good then the greedy founders decided to take that money and buy themselves there own personal mansions im not saying BLM is a bad organization but the good its done isn't really there to see since its more of a give us whatever THU FUK WE WANT then a GIVE US JUSTICE movement
There was another Arthur episode where the rude customer was in a viral video at the sugar bowl saying stuff that I couldn’t repeat here anyway Arthur and his friends were talking about the video in group chat
where’s thomas the tank engine? that whole show was basically just about racism lol because of the steam engines vs. diesels trope
the fresh prince one was too real bro holy shit
I love the video but....     Is that Danny Devito in the background?😎
who the guy behind you  in the video?
Don't be racist, I am a Garnet
fun fact: like Arthur there was an actual protest against racism where black people wouldn't be served at a bar and had been less treated  4 black college students decided to stand up to the white people who wouldn't do it by sitting at there until they would be served, there's also a book about it. at the end they ended up getting served. i don't remember the name tho.
The best Kids show I've seen that Tackles racism is: "my little pony friend-ship is magic!"  In an episode in the very first season, the character of Zecora is discriminated against because she is a zebra. Even the six main characters discriminate against her.  But then the character of Apple Bloom opens up to Zecora and the two end up becoming friends.  Then later the six Main characters open up to Zecora and overtime the rest of Ponyville recognize her as normal.  The reason why I think it works is you can imagine Zecora as anybody who is different. White Black or Brown.
🫠🫠
18:10 It’s a garbage PSA.
it’s gay too. Men are not supposed to be gay. But the black guy can have a woman. And the white guy can have a women to marry too. But that is racist.
0:00
Nah he got the wrong point he should’ve said boys cant marry boys cuz thats a fact
Virgil’s dad: Richie ran away along time ago, who can blame him?
The most racist people in the US have black skin
10:37-10:40 the text under the scene and the way the volume was highered got me laughing
18:27  top text    It was all fake. Be racist That the only thing i think of when i see this clip

Racism....in Sesame Street?!
Dude i love your no face tattoo
I always thought Steven universe would be a homophobic cartoon
Why is there a man behind this dude🤨
The fresh prince of bel air reference the 1992 LA Riots   Four police officers Beat up the motorist Rodney king in 1991 and another problem in south central LA african american teenage girl Latasha Harlins was killed by Korean liquor store owner,  the store owner think that Harlins was going to shoplift the bottle orange juice , Harlins was going to pay the juice but the korean store owner shot latasha harlins with a gun and she pled Guilty for man slaughter also she was sentence to community service and Parole and more people in LA are in Rage and now in 1992 April 29th 4 police officers have been acquitted Not Guilty for beating up Rodeny king and thats when LA When up in Flames and Rioting and south central turned into scorched battle Grounds including Gun fights as well .  LA was a total Nightmare in USA
i refuse to believe that you would do research on sesame street and not know what hooper's store is lol
Traintrap
Why is no one talking about the grandpa in the background
The episode Troq in teen titans tackled this topic pretty well
Not to criticize but, That's So Raven, Sesame Street, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air are not cartoons. Although the Sesame Street one is very interesting.
Arthur first aired in *1996*
Aurthur probably got so many failed grades that he got held back for 27yrs
let’s be honest ☠️ most of the dislikes on the steven universe vid were trolls/ bigots
The cops to tell it to the judge that’s Phil banks
Bruh the kid is right gays cant be married but blacks can be married but to women only of whatever race
Static kinda sounds like someone tried to ripoff Shazam and completely try to turn it into a different character 🤨💬.
You got me with that grey Hoodie. The actual part that did me in was the red pillow behind your head. I thought it was some sort of cosplay thing, lol.
OMG OMG OMG! I have seen this and watch this video on YouTube and it was awesome! I don't like racism but I loved all of these except for the Steven Universe one! I think all of these have tackled racism! There are also black people that deserve better! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I See Danny Devito in the background.
Besides pointing out that Fresh Prince and That's So Raven is not a cartoon, I remember these episodes, and the episodes still left an impact on me. Especially with Disney not being afraid to tackle a serious topic like this. However, let's be honest Static Shock handle the topic way better, and there was no contest Sesame Street would handle the topic better than any cartoon.
Black people can not
I’m surprised that’s so raven and the fresh prince of bel air got a section on a video called racism approached in *cartoons*
Seems like older cartoons tackled racism better than these modern cartoons.
Including a minority is cash money, pandering to one is not cash money
I liked the og psa for Steven universe because it showed how lgbt has a problem, while also showing how racism is a problem. The idea of how the psa was made really made me quite happy
wait… this is not about race cars?
Anytime racism is discussed, especially with newer shows, people will be pissed no matter how well done it is.
Wtf
I LOVE THE CONKERS BAD FUR DAY MUSIC AT 6:17!!!!
I do not care about BLM or LGBTQ  BLM and LGBTQ racist so shut up cn
When "Fresh Prince" got real, it got REAL
Cold is awsome dude keep it up because I love it
i remember watchinng this episode of arthur but i was too stupid to understand
As morgon freeman says "The only way to end racism is to stop talking about it."
The steven universe thing was that people r homophobic but prolly not racist bc if that was a lil girl n a boy they would say aweee
static shock handled it  so well
I don’t know if you know this but that’s so raven isn’t a cartoon
That is a great character for you. As an artist in a timeless void with nothing better to do besides watch over multiverses. I like it.
Great video but these are mostly not cartoons.

oh yah go little  kitty
I like black people I hate white people but it was be old
Arthur is sus
Arthur is racism
There was a BFDI episode…
my brother is black
Surprised SpongeBob wasn't here.
My hero academia (season 5 episode 10): Deku gets a new quirk called "Black whip."
personal i like tuvs face better than the cartoon cuz tuv  beautiful
If I say my honest opinion youtube will probably take down my comment
I'll make them work-👴
"tuvington"
hey I think I see a man in your room
Bro the “bro clam down lmao” text got me laughing more than the fart noises 💀😂
"racism on sesame street" 💀
Bro wtf lol. That Steven Universe PSA was so weird, like really force fed
I saw the episode of Arthur in PBS kids .
Is it so wrong that I want miles to say the n word?
Most of these aren’t cartoons
Get Real meme be like: 0:31
I wish more of these shows had gotten dubs, at least from my experience I never really watched any of these as a Swedish kid (arthur and steven universe excluded as the episodes came out when I was in my teens) and I honestly think they could've been usefull for me to see as I grew up in an area where racism was fairly prevelent. Even that's so raven didn't get a dub and would air late at night when disney channel swapped from airing shows in Swedish to English over night. I didn't understand english until I was about 12 at which point I had mostly stopped watching kids channels and would only do it when no one else was around.
static shock handle racism the best
While i do think the first steven universe short was cheezy, i think the critism that its "too progressive" or "distracts from the point". This people still understood the point, gay interracial couples exist. To me that critism is just an excuse to be homophobic.
"he's a knitter" everyone thought they said something else.💀
John lewis in arthur is just 💀
Proud family and Velma are terrible when it comes to this topic despite being revolved around it. They basically try to make white people feel like they are supposed to “do better” because of what their ancestors did and it didnt sit right with me at all (a black male) Velma is much worse than Proud family tho, because during multiple episodes they just flat out make racist comments about white people and think its ok for sum reason
Great video but there's a minor mistake on the Fresh Prince segment, Phillip Banks is a judge, not a lawyer.
I hate this guy but I love his content
11:56 the problem is that kids are not supposed to know about this
You need to do video games that tackled serious issues like this video.
that is most racist steven universe episode ever
the only I have with the anti racist ad for Steven universe is that they are both boys and talking about getting married?! I don't like it. not because of race but because of them being boys. like why couldn't one of them be a girl huh?
Racism sucks.
I loved sons of the fathers because it tackles a serious issue with respect
I remember the author episode
Also Timothy: *After the girl says "Black people can't marry white people"* I think the problem is more that it's a boy marrying another boy and that it's not a black person marrying a white person.
Also Timothy: *goes to Telly and Baby Bear's Information Stall* DO YOU HAVE ANY INFO ON THE DOOR 50 PUZZLE?!
Timothy The Spider (That character from Doors): *To Gina and Savion after they do the fart sound* That's rude
What do you think of this pixel as applejack and stingy as rarity
You know my dream is to make my own graphic novels someday and make so many inspirational and exciting  stories. One of which would be around the topic of racism. How a black teenager and a white girl become friends regardless of what’s happening in the real world. To escape it temporarily they are able to escape into a video game world. Both worlds give them the confidence to fight racism and prove that everyone different in this world is special and what we can do to fight it and protect those who are getting hurt. Very vague and hard to understand I know but I’m determined to make a story like that someday. Because I’ll always protect and try to be befriend anyone regardless of their race, religion, or belief.
Can we talk about the stalker Danny Devito in the background
17:10 could’ve warned us of that jumpscare
JUSTICE FOR DYSLEXICS!!!
For some weird reason that cartoon character gives me chills
Bro the cartoon bloke looks fuckin tired  Let him sleep goddam
That FreshbPrince episode is one of the best.  It should be talked about more than that episode with Will's Dad that has been done to death.
I love how it says cartoons but there are live action shows😂😂
Leafy? Never heard of him
I will admit that most hip hop is a horrible influence that only talks about selling drugs, gang banging, drug abuse, alcoholism and treating women like nothing but sex objects.  But you can't blame and entire group of people for that.
With the fresh prince of Bel-Air it actually is illegal to drive too slow
Whit ghy takly aboot rakism    Also mlpp
OK, even the cartoon that wasn’t fair how Black people get treated don’t you think
Can u do more static shock
Bernie what the FUCK is that man statue thing in the corner behind u? At 1st I actually thought it was a real guy standing there in there corner, watching u😅
👏👏👏👏
8:12 the way she says it 😂
I remember in one South Park episode that there was a time when Eric Cartman dressed up as Adolf Hitler
Why is richy dad 2d mr incredible
thank god people weren't "woke" about other stuff back then would've been super cringe.
Okay, when I saw you're plush, I thought it was some kind of Squidward/Olaf baby thing  I'm sorry
tuv u are very cute LMAO
I can’t believe steven universe got that many dislikes😮
wow.
When you’ve seen all of these shows except Steven universe-
Pfff yeah like im gonna listen to Some childish cartoons
OMG we all have equal rights.. you're oppressing yourself! Get over it.
Family Matters had a show where Laura wants to add a black history class and then she becomes a target for someone and they wrote a racial slur on her locker...it was one that has never left my thoughts because I felt her pain and I am Mexican American...I love how Estelle comforted Laura and that episode makes me cry every time...we should all learn from one another and embrace our histories.
why is a old man behind you, is he going to bite your balls?
Racism being shown in kids media is great, but i really don’t like how the person being racist is always white, this gives kids the idea that only white people can be racist, also when racism is shown it’s always white people being racist to black people, and not any other race.  Racism can happen to anyone, anyone can be racist, and all racism is wrong.
I know it's not a cartoon, but I heard there is an OFFICAL NINTENDO magazine that shows Black Yoshi getting bullied by the other colored Yoshis.
It's calm and mature. Fool. Adverbs ending in "ly" can not be used as adjectives.
The girl saying “the truth is I don’t hire black people” she really sounded like Regina George
Bro they didnt have that one rabids episode
That's so raven has some amazing animation
Bro no one cares about the asians
Stactic shock animation looks like animan studios animation style.😊😊😊
God you are so young lol
500 page essay?? Poor kid 😭😭💀💀
The reason the civil war happened is because us in the north have buildings and gay space rocks to tell us not to be racist.
Susssssssssssss
Pov: racisim lore
I remember watching the That’s So Raven show as a little kid, I don’t remember a ton of specific episodes from that show but I never forgot the one about racism. Too bad today no matter how mature a kid’s show may go about teaching these life lessons, the right-wing media will start playing the woke card and tell their audience some bs like “they’re grooming kids to hate white people.” Our country’s education and respect for others as a whole is going down the toilet.
idk if you did this or not but there is an episode in family reunion called remeber when our boys became men
CrZy how many goosebumps from tuv mentioning static shock that shit just made me remember my childhood I completely forgot bout that show
As a black person, I am very nervous of showing my face in social media mostly because of fear of rascism. The only people I show my face to are the ones I trust to and very close to.
The shot at leafy had me rolling 😭😭😭
The one good thing about those Steven universe anti racist psas is that they didn’t drag Peridot into them.
by the way tuv, guest stars in arthur always have extremely humane facial features.
The way the guy in the back scares me every video 😂
tbh I thought the garnet one was funny lol
Its funny how older cartoons handles racism better than modern ones.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-air episode you talk about always bothered me. In arguing against stereotyping people, they stereotype the police. This almost completely undermines what they were trying to do; teach people not to judge.  I'd like to see you comment on a sitcom episode that handled racism properly. That series is called "A Different World". The episode is called "Cat's in the Cradle". It shows that there is a third side to the issue of racism.
There’s actually a bunch of reason why it was dislike bombed but long story short The Steven universe fandom back then was really racist 😂
oh yes, "racist" moments that "totally" happen in real life, god get a life and stop pushing your propaganda onto kids
Steven Univers is always pushing confelting messages
i love this video!!!
Life is not gonna be harder if you are black or white
i remember that Jim Henson had to scrap one of his puppets for it being a racial stereotype on... certain people. that was a mistake and a half on Jim's part
Dude I don't want to alarm you, but Danny Devito is RIGHT behind you. Don't make any sudden movements.
I'm a white dude. But I grew up in the pj's. Didn't even have questions white friend until halfway through high-school. But that episode of fresh prince was the first time I really saw racism when I was little
The fresh prince of bel air was such a good show. I watched all six for the first about 5-6 years ago, and it holds up really well in my opinion.
I feel like older cartoons showed ways to tackle racism better than modern ones
I can't believe someone in a kids cartoon straight up said racist
what is up with kid cartoon creators hiding things that are not kid appropriate in their cartoons tho
tuvington cause why not...
16:20 LMAOOO 😭😭 BRO IVE BEEN LAUGHING AT THIS DUDES FACE FOR LIKE 20 MINUTES 😭😭😭😭😭
Where do i find the original vid- also, “tuvington”
What i like about Static is that it showed that Richie's Dad and his bigotry effected everyone around him.  Because he saw Virgil negatively it almost ruined his son's friendship and sour his relationship with his dad. The show doesn't blankly call it out immediately it let the audience gauge the situation first. Mr.Foley came into his own conclusion and denounced his bigorty because HE saw how negatively it was effecting his family and how virgil and even Mr.Hawkins showed him nothing but kindness and respect.
When Will said at 1st of show this is a black thing.
Raven show was my show
Cussing
Cussing i c lol smh lol
I wish someone upload shock full video on YouTube
In the show with raven I only know that show because I saw the remake of it where she is a mom with children
Fun fact: Racism in older cartoons was normal,since “kids” age ratings weren’t that strict at the time
NO IM NOT A KNITTER
Bruh the Leafy roast gave me whiplash 💀
I like when racism is approached in kids cartoons, it teaches kids that racism is a big problem in a way kids could understand.
There a third Steven univers PSA thats even worse and more blatant and in your face
OMG TUV ! I didn't realize I clicked on your video
Wish we could get this same acknowledgment in shows about lgbtq people awareness 😔
Even tho will smith pretty much ruined his career, fresh prince was one of the best shows ever. Always loved static shock too. That steven universe psa was so forced tho. Like they trying to check every box. It was supposed to be about racism not sexuality. Not sure whats this big push of sexuality onto kids. The kids didn't have to be LGBT. That's a separate issue. That's why it got so many dislikes. Plus it felt fake.
“Let’s go Brandon” - Tuv (2023)
Bruh the sesemestreet one was very cringy. Not the episodes, but the way people reacted to it in 2020 and called it woke without realising that they did the same thing in the 90s. Since it is a todler show, it obviously will seem cringe and weird on how they handle it, but what other way can you teach a 3 year old avout how there are racists out there even in the sunniest and most friendly city or street there is. No mater where you are, there will always be discrimination even in the most progresive and happiest place ever. That why we protest and speak up that it still exists and that they must not be silenced.
Title says cartoons but covers fresh prince, “a different world” had a good episode as well
I love how static shock handles things in manners children at the time could understand easily.
Lol most replayed is just skipping the intro
Richies dad is the most PC racist
i didn't really see the issue if the first psa having gay people in it, it's as normal as if it was straight people, the psa was about racism, so why focus on anything else
Ngl good opinions it’s just that I’m not watching for the message, you know? Pls don’t cancel me.
I like how the title is "Racism Approached in Cartoons", when only have the segments featured here are actual cartoons, while the others are just live-action shows.
I ALWAYS burst in laughs when I see the racist boy of Garnet's PSA, for two reasons:  1- He says "people from different races cannot marry" and COMPLETELY ignores they're the same sex. It's like: "Hey, I may be racist, but being homophobe is a line I'm not willing to cross".  2- He is an actor. AN ACTOR, and he is the only one, in the end, who is completely aware of how silly his character is.
18:14 oh no that’s Unholy.  Premeridal hand holding in my Christian show about diamond people!!!  Those to should only hand hold once they get married, disgusting what they are showing to our kids yuck!!!
It's so funny to me how static shock seemed so much more realistic, I don't think Richie's dad would do a complete 180 like that but it I guess it just had to be wrapped up in that 20 minute episode, but compared to that's so Raven the 2nd just seemed so cartoonishly over the top I legit thought it was going to end up being just some kind of misunderstanding
Bro who is that man at your back?
Bro tuv looks so much like this kid I’m friends with
Statick ❤
Tbh, I thought how good or bad these cartoons portrayed racism or how they worked through it and discussing your opinions. Instead it's just you summarizing them. Since the su one is something I dislike with how fake it is, while static shock and fresh prince have a more realistic tone that doesn't take away from entertainment for the message they want to send.
Am I the only one that was in love with those big Tatas on Chelsea in that so raven
18:15 "when we're older let's get married" Me: AYO AYO U CANT MARRY MENS THAT IS GAY
Shows like Sesame Street and Bluey are why I can like children's programming. Both touch on real life issues and teach kids healthy ways to deal with said topic.
7:51 500 PAGE ESSAY???
You know what’s racist how they are only pointing out racism against black people
Pretty surprised the Teen Titans episode wasn't on here. It has one of the best portrays racism *very* well. Really like the lesson that not all people will stop being racist and make a change. If they consider you an exception, they'll label you as "One of the good ones" and carry on their beliefs.
Honestly I love that media is able to touch subjects like these especially in a proper way. I only wish it could be done as effectively as it was done in older media in our current media
I remember watching that That’s So Raven episode, I remember thinking it was so crazy seeing that l white lady saying “she doesn’t hire black people” I was gagged as a kid
That’s so raven isn’t a cartoon lmao
The sesame street episode aired literally a week after I was born. Thats crazy. Even back then kids shows weren't afraid of speaking the truth
Static Shock definitely did it best. Arthur and Buster talking about black people was confusing though, aren’t they animals? Is the Arthur world just Black people and Animals? Why are these Animals so racist to black people? Why do they not care about Reptiles being denied employment in any job that doesn’t indicate manual labour?
Cant help but feel that one Rabbids short expressed the topic better than all .
💀 chain
NAAH why was he in bed with her like that
The creator looks like the dad bec the beard :P
Sesame Street 1993.  Wow, so old.
7:14 thats so raven
you forgot Malcolm In The Middle  Season 4 The Baby Part 1 and The Baby Part 2. The Grandma is the Racist one
who remembers that Arthur was being called a knitter 💀
Litteraly, when i want to watch some of your videos, the video will just stop in like 20% and then dont want to turn on. You are the only  channel in what this is happening.
The thing about what the kid said about behind the scenes  it just looked really fake
The fresh prince of bel-air had a pretty bad take, not all cops are racist. It’s like saying all blondes are stupid.
dude dont worry, we love your chin
NOOOOO TUV BECAME A PNG TUBER
thats so raven really had to prove a point by making chelsea the worst candidate and raven the best yet the lady chose chelsea for the job anyway.... lmao
the way this lady pronounced that line in thats so raven episode is so goofy, really pronouncing every letter individually lol
I heard raven said the n word in that’s so raven on one episode…talking about her dad?
John Lewis’s look doesn’t shock me after Matt Damon
The only racism these cartoons talk about it is against colored people when there is literally news reporters and activists demonizing all white people and using slurs without repercussions.
DO A CARTOON ICEBURG!!!
So glad you mentioned Static Shock! Such a great example!
I think the only weird thing is I've never seen any examples like this that aren't white on black. I guess it being American might be the reason but there are countless prevalent examples across the world where other races are subject to abuse, and black people have been on both sides both today and throughout history. When do we ever see arabs or asians in these PSAs? This might be a controversial comment, and I'm not trying to say black people haven't suffered from racism, because they clearly have to a great degree. If you think someone NOT preaching what you believe in for 0.2 milliseconds means they disagree with you, that's a little childish. I just think for young impressionable children this can easily paint a message of "black people good, white people bad" as if black-on-black, black-on-white, white-on-asian, asian-on-black, black-on-mixed, white-on-arab, and other conflicts aren't things that literally happen every day all across the world and throughout history. That's probably why some people take this to the extreme and call it "facism" (I don't think it is), because they believe the only message that matters is this specific one, and not racism and discrimination as a whole. Racism is a very complex issue and one that is sadly often skewed by politics, so trying to dilute that down into a simplified message to impressionable children, absorbing the biases of the creator of that PSA could be dangerous. Kids shows could do a lot better at instead promoting love, acceptance and a lack of discrimination and treating everyone with respect.
Seeing a white toddler raising a flag that says "black lives matter" is a complete nightmare. It's like we're actually becoming dumber as a society. Apparently not all lives matter, this is really what cartoons are teaching kids nowadays and we're just simply allowing it. We're not making any progress whatsoever.
you saying you didn't grow up with Fresh Prince made me feel SO OLD
“I’m not a nitter, I’m not a nitter!” - Arthur
I want face!!
So where’s the boondocks on the list?
get the lip gloss out your eyes
16:09 it was weird hearing you call her *Sue* as opposed to _Sue Ellen_  😂 Thats her name 😭😭
MY BEST FRIEND'S GONE CAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR SUPID RACISM
Why is your grandpa in the background?
Day 1 the guy in the background plz in your next vid.
18:24 Don't be racist I am a building
Sadly the sort of "in-your-face" wokeness causes people to react in a bitter way. I appreciate shows being able to tackle issues in a productive and natural way. They do often go overboard to the point of being annoying though, and they villainize the people they should be focusing on helping to become better people. They also need to realize that only 10% aren't heterosexual. They need to realize as well that not every couple needs to be mixed race. There are a myriad of things that are disproportionately represented in media and shoved in people's faces. You also have liberals on social media platforms condemning people for being cis-gendered and white and advocating for their eradication. That's why people are so upset. It's not because they are all hateful bigots. Those people exist sure, but I'd guess they are less than 1% of the hated cis-whites.
This is from “Gemini home entertainment” and they aren’t called “Skin walkers” Oml
Cory needs to write 500 pages??? 7:51
The lil cartoon you looks like a emo version of Kurtis Conner  It's awesome [=<
This is unimportant, but I have 2 things to say, 1) tuvs pfp looks like shigeyo kageyama, and 2), his pfp is also frickin cute!?
i remember that arthur episode! and also remember the day it ended after a long time!
Ok. But what that person in the background
I remember watching that static shock episode
Bro who is that in the background
Tuvingyon
Who's that in the back💀
Leafys chin😂😂😂😂.  Those jokes are still funny years late hahaha.  Ahh man idubzzz 😂
I love tho editing
I honestly thought it was fine it's really no big deal and I'm genuinely confused as to why the dislikes
The cartoon character looks like shit, commission a better artist
“Ha! You can't get married” “Why not?” “Thats gay” “Ohhh ok”
12:00 the new spinoff show “Bel-air” also mostly talks about racial discrimination/issues that the blk community face. I really like the show bc of how different they made the story & how vocal the show is abt educating ppl 👍🏼
Poopie
Whoa,am I the only one who see's a man in the corner of this guy's room😲😳😳. I had to laugh though
Static Shock- The last episode of Season 2 "Jimmy" School Shooting Episode
I feel like the two boys being gay in the Stephen Universe BLM PSA was good, as lgbtq+ people should be more normalized (IMO)
Im sorry but the drawing aint it but im one person so its up to the community
Show not tell. That is the best way to teach people, especially kids. That's how static shock did it
NO WAY TUV X FUNERAL IM PASSING OUT
static shock psa's are goated they are so nuanced and grounded
I can't believe 🎵White people can't marry black people🎵
Give me the to the original
Tickle Elmo💀
My man you are very entertaining and interesting keep it up
This is one of my favourite fresh prince of Bel-Air episodes and I guess in a way they all kinda tackle racism in one way or another glad to see it on here.
Bro that one episode In static shock where the kid who gets bullied finally steps up and pulls out a gun. That hit different
This hook was perfect I'm about to watch the video just because of this
Cute tuv character
18:25 it was all fake, be racist:)
To me, that's so raven was just another kids sitcom, then you said "sees into the future" and *brain neuron activated*
So we’re not gonna talk about the guy in the back of his room 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 ????  18:40
Arthur actually premiered on PBS ON October 7th , 1996 the same day as Hey Arnold over on Nick 15:14
So fuckin stupid why is everyone who is racist in this white. I see and hear more about how blacks are better and shit😂 and blm is just fine but say white lives matter TOO and your a fuckin racist color will always be here if we keep glorifying it instead of seeing people for the person they are
So fuckin stupid why is everyone who is racist in this white. I see and hear more about how blacks are better and shit😂 and blm is just fine but say white lives matter TOO and your a fuckin racist color will always be here if we keep glorifying it instead of seeing people for the person they are
The Steven universe fandom needs that PSA no matter how bad it is. That way it'll be canon that the show is against racism and then the Steven universe fans will have to download the new personality package
The little animation/character of Tuv is dope. Use it more.
Why you look like dat ? 💀
static shock also had a school shooting psa where some kid is being bullied but he eventually snaps and brings a gun to school but gets ambushed by static shock and accidently shoots the guy in the green sweater
I love raven but there is also another show called ravens home and in season 5 episode 20 stylin’ and profilin’ booker gets pulled over by a cop because he was black and you could look at the rest from there
In my opinion, the Amethyst BLM short is the worst one. It basically says that colorblindness is bad and that whites and blacks should be treated differently. Amethyst also claims that comparing different skin colors to different alien races "distracts from the real problem", even though it's actually demonstrating just how stupid racism is.  These shorts came out during the BLM protests, so they're obviously milking them for social brownie points.  Both supporters and critics of the BLM organization hated these shorts and for good reasons.  Also, Teen Titans' "Troq" was also a good episode about racism. The subject is handled with maturity, unlike how Steven Universe handled it.
BRO THE OLD MAN IN THE BACKGROUND
The face is very human and I really don’t like it.
6:20
tuvington
Black people are way more racist than white people. White people are better persons seriously. More cultured and civilized.
"im not a knitter!"
No one talks about the my little pony episode
Bro All lives matter
❤❤❤
And Steven Universe P.S.A's just suck, they're too over the top with bad animation quality and one of em' was just downright dishonest and cringe worthy... That's why people dislike them.
tuvington
Uncle Phil was a judge. Fresh Prince is awesome.
Hooray for consistency. And cartoons!
the steven universe one was so silly when it came out i thought it wasnt officiap
But did anyone notice the dad quickly put a glove on before he shuck hands?
Yipeeee
Half of these aint cartoons but im not complaining i guess
Family Matters has a really good episode about racism too.
18:49 NO! NOT HIMMM  😫 I  FORGOT ABOUT HIM AND I WISH IT STAYED LIKE THAT
I mean, racist man has a point, rap music sucks, not the other things obviously. I just don’t like rap music
I wanna act as static shock live action, that would be cool.
0:41 who is that guy staring at you in the background
“Kids don’t be racist.” Garnet
Face better
Who’s that behind u 😰😰 1:30
Racism is good and so is slavery
I hate how it devolves threw out the years.  Especially when it came to the mid to late 2010s.  It feels so forced.
I never knew that’s so raven was a cartoon 🤔 Totally mind blowing 🤯
Steven universe, Regular Show, and Adventure Time hit mad different when I was a kid and to this day I'm 16 and still watching all them
Tubs editing is insane
You thought that so raven was corny? 😐
dude this is the first time i watch you and you slightly moved your head and i thought i was about to watch you get like murdered or something bc of danny in the back 😭
I knew a few of these but only because Arthur and the Static Shock episodes were called out as being very racist episodes. However, I now have a better understanding that the purpose of the episodes was originally to deal with racism and teach about it and not the direct racism for the sake of racism. Plus, I have also never had the opportunity to see these episodes in question myself, so I have had to rely on what other people say about them which biases my previous understanding.
I thought the Steven universe one was that the kid said interracial couples couldn’t get married would be the actual problem, since it’s not true (nor being a gay married couple, at least in certain countries), not the fact it was both. But it seemed kind of dumb and too ignorant for children to understand anyways.
Tuv i like your character
Who tf is that old guy in the back of his room 💀😊
Fresh Prince is a cartoon show?😂
i like a little of your on screen cartoon. i want more of your face tho. you can keep the mic on your chin if you want, we're chill. we get that you feel uncomfortable tho
Wait, so the Steven universe short was hated or should I say disliked because it was showing two guys in the short that it distracted from the message? Come on people, THIS IS AMERICA! You mean to tell me we can't support both LGBTQ + and the Black culture. The support of both of these community starts and ends with us and we need to show that both of them matter. ✊🏾
I'm just trying to be constructive with this remark, cartoon tuv is cringy. Makes it feel kiddy.
Ayo what earl doin under that blanket 👀
500 pages essay
Hay don't be racist. Bro I'm sorry but. Lol. I'm not racist. It's just how she said it.
Lmao leafy joke
How do I not just noticed this but I noticed that tuv was emo
I would love if this crap was never on my recommended 😊
That's just how Arthur handles all celebrity cameos. They make them look as realistic as possible for the art style. They usually look out of place.
Static Shock was an incredibly based show. If it were released today, it'd be considered woke by every conservative
The Steven Universe one is just hilarious at best.
Watching this and it has 999K views lil
Most of these shows are not cartoons: That's So Raven, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air are definitely not cartoons. Even Sesame Street is not really a cartoon
Repressed memory unlocked lmfaoo
Most of these weren't cartoons lol
That first one was sick and slick, that's how you approach it, it's realistic bar the superheros 😂
I love the The Fresh Prince of Bel Air kept the talk about racism realistic
i think making fart noises to drown out racists should be the standard, no notes sesame street
Great video! If you don't mind me saying, I think you should show your face more often. You're very attractive.
Who else thought the Arthur one was a different episode   👇
I always love when we get direct lessons about racism like this, but I have to say that I also love when they go more indirect routes to get past the sensors. One of my favorite examples of this is the episode Troq from Teen Titans. They get around it by making Starfire the target, and the racist is another alien who looks down on her for being Tameranian. Cyborg ends up being the first to find out, and they again find a clever way of having him relate to her for the mistreatment because he's part robot, which has already been a reoccurring source of insecurity for him throughout the show. Starfire: You also know how it feels to be judged for how you look? Cyborg: Of course I do. I'm part robot
Ritchie: I hope you're happy Dad! My best friend is gone because of YOUR RACISM!
I think it's good for kids to be introduced to social issues like this and how to confront them. Bigotry doesn't come naturally, it's taught. Says a lot that people don't want kids to learn about that
I think the argument for the Steven Universe one about them being gay is just bullshit. It would be the exact same if they were straight.
About That's So Raven the name of Episode "True Colors" it was so dark
I think I can understand why Steven universe anti-racism was not good because there are other races that have faced harsh racism too like instead of having a racist person said black people can't date white people why not just have that racist person said people can only date their own race not other race people even you're mixed race which that's fine, Just choose one race of what you got from your DNA blood especially men should date women and women should date men not to date the same sex to become LGBTQ. Which would be the total perfect racist poem and to teach children what truly racism is like. Just speaking about it.
it's sad how America is built on racism and all white people get the blame  by stupid people in America it sucks in two ways
As A Mixed Kid Whos Black And White I Cried From The Video...
I originally found the song Cherry Soda and has no idea who you were. So this is very weird seeing your YouTube content after not knowing you made the song 😂
hey you know the steven univers psas well what if i tell you that the roundtable and veradis joe called pepole who disliked it or critisised it homophobic not racist so in other words it did muddy the waters
Make video on drugs being shown in cartoon
Ok
Who's that in the background
Family guy series
Do one about t ok teach people not to judge special needs people
Static shock was good at addressing things
It's probably been said before but tuv is the most likeable person on youtube
We need a static shock reboot
I love the show Static Shock. What a distant memory
"racism" *sigh* _scrolls_ "👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻👴🏻"
fun fact 😃 The main character of the fresh prince of bel aire is a guy named William "Will" Smith the actor playing will is name Willard "Will" Smith!
That's so Raven is not a cartoon though?
Why did Zim need to traumatize kids?
Everyday his damn camera goes to himself, I see homie in the back and just mentally gasp... STILL
I thought you were just talking about cartoons? I am confused but still good channel
Why boomerang man? I also miss cartoon network at night which was i think adult swims stomping ground before becoming its own channel
This should be called racism in media for youth, not cartoons 😂
do u send to canada
Why is there a random man standing behind u
I feel so bad for all the black people watching this😢
Ah yes my favorite cartoon.  Fresh prince of Bel Air
Wow the nostalgia!!! I remember these all 😢
I actually watched the episode of the prince of bel-air, and it was well made and it was really nice that they decided to make it
Title: “Racism Approached in Cartoons”  Video: *half of the shows listed are live action*  Jokes aside, good video and good research done 👍
The real reasons that the Cartoon Network episode got dislikes is because not every likes or supports or wants there child to know LGBTQ+ exists. (No racism here just opinion)
Love how half of these aren't cartoons, still a high quality video.
I like how only half of the examples are cartoons
Uhhhh why the FUCK is there a man…or dummy..creepily in the background???
So when are we getting a Static Shock live action movie?  They spend too much time trying to make white characters black that they overlook some really great characters that already happen to be black. Another thing about That's So Raven was that it shows how difficult it is to prove racism. Even while a black person can be perfectly qualified for the job, sometimes to lose to someone who isn't (but happens to be white).
Cringe
I get some of the point about Steven’s anti-racism but bringing gay isn’t a problem, its not focusing on lgbtq it’s just there is a gay person
I guess the lesson here is to approach racism in a tv show in a positive and the right way and amazing video man :]
Let's Goooooooooooooooooooooo
so we not finna talk bout how 16:50 it says 10 subs 💀💀
7:51 Do you mean page, because 500 PAGE!!??
intro edit was crazy
2:18 nahhh bro abt to fight William afton💀💀
Teen titans also does a good job approaching racism
> cartoons  > reven, sesame street, fresh prince  How high were you, Tuv? :P
I actually forgot about the show Arthur I used to watch it all the time whenever it was on
Do cartoons teach you how to be a professional victim and blame white people for everything wrong as well or is that only the Democratic Party?
Common Sesame Street w
Half of these weren't cartoons though
I'm not shocked a lot of people disliked those videos. People don't like bring up stuff that may make them/their country look bad. But every race has racism in it. Humans are humans & some people are jerks. No race to immune to it 😂
nah, 500 page essay is crazy dawg
Can u do LGBT done right in cartoons? And cab u briefly at least shout out Manic in the cartoon Sonic underground? Sonic has 2 siblings in this show,Sonia & Manic. Some may see the scene as problematic but near the end of the second ep he basically says he's gay.   Sonia:You saved me more than once and besides you are my brother. "Kisses Sonic's cheek"  Sonic to Manic: you're not gonna kiss me are ya?!   Manic: No way! But u r kinda cute!  Manic was my favorite before I discovered the LGBT community,so rewatching the show,and seeing this representation was amazing,being part of it myself. Though slightly problematic & very brief,it's still amazing. Especially since it was only that one bit & they didn't go out making him a stereotypical gay character & make it his only personality trait like in some media out there. He's just a cool dude who likes other dudes. 💚
17:31 decent script
Blacks can be racist as wel
The problem with racism is everyone  uses it as a crutch. Nobody alive ever owned a slave or has anyone been a slave. So get over it.
I was not ready for Arthur-ized John Lewis
17:59 they both have pink skin, you can see it on the ears 🤓
Tuv Waifu?
John Lewis having the light skin stare 16:25
I'm irked that they're supposed to be eating southern food in the That's So Raven episode, but there isn't any veggies. We eat collard greens, okra, field peas, black eyed peas, cabbage, corn, etc.
2:54 why does the hero character look like ishowspeed
bro my FBI isnt letting me watch this lol 💀
In the words of Frank Reynolds "I'm gonna say the N word."
The same thing happens for kids with disabilities (autism) like me but when it's presented it's VERY bad and the representation of characters with autism are the worst ones, examples: sheldon, spencer reid, etc.  That's why films like 'A silent voice' have been a go to for any disability, even mental ones because in the real world we get treated this way, even by those of different race/sexuality.  It would be nice to, cover the topic and bring more awareness to it if possible
Bro raven and bel air ain't cartoons
When the arthur episode came up, all I could remember was that "Knitter! Knitter!' 'No, I'm not a Knitter!" meme 💀
0:21 feels heavily Turkey Tom referenced
Idc what anyone says Steven Universe has gay characters for attention
I'm never forgetting  "black can't marry white peopleee 🎶"  they ignored the fact that it was gay and instantly factored in race. Ts makes me giggle to this day 💀💀💀
The only one of these I don't like is the Stephen universe one. Ironically because that situation dosnt happen lol no one's running up like "black people and white people shouldent be married!" out in a playground setting with kids. Racism, sexism and homophobia are most often subtle underhanded things right? Prejudice rarely labels itself clearly. It would honestly be better if they did cause then you'd know who to avoid. There are a few like out and proud bigots and nazis but there the minority. Most of the dangerious crap happens under the table and behind closed doors. The seseme street one did the same kind of thing but it's aimed at actual toddlers and the person being anonymous? Yeah, that usually is how it is. People who are bigots in private, and vote against human rights, are just as dangerous as the loud ones. Maybe worse, since you have the opertunity to change the minds of the obvious ones but ones who remain isolated and insulated just go on festering like a cancer.
My problem is that people still think Racism is a problem. Come on. Racism is the LAST thing Black People have to deal with. I don't see Black People being segregated in the 2020s. I don't see separate schools or drinking fountains or being forced to sit in the back of the bus.   I don't see people wearing white hoods.   I don't see Black People being forced to be slaves and working in farm fields all day being whipped.  But a minority of the population are jerks & suddenly "REE! Racist!"  Heck if anything, Black on Black Crime is worse than Racism.    And another thing. Why are all of the White Characters in Films & TV Shows being Race Swapped with Black Actors? Ariel, Tinker Bell, etc. Why does Hollywood keep giving Black People the Sloppy Seconds from White People instead of using Original characters?  But nope. Guess Everything is Racist.
That so Raven episode was the first thing to ever teach me about racism as a kid, I saw that and started looking at myself like I’m bad or something, until I realized the real. Miss the old days
"He's so grateful that his son is saved by, you know, a black n- superhero."
Since when are the fresh price of belair & that’s so raven considered cartoons? My entire life I’ve thought of cartoons as drawn animations not shows that have actual people as every character, but I guess that could just be me?
Great video!
Tuvington  fr fr
Not a fan of telling minorities they need to be afraid…
I’m surprised how civil and respectful most of the discussions in the comments are, wish discussions on these topics were usually this civil
I put the Static Shock episode the same level as one of the best ways to show social problems. Another example is one of the episodes of Powerpuff Girls called Equal Fights that tackles gender equality in a good way and not really shoving it down our throats like some movies and shows nowadays...
8:10 this could be memeable
7:52 500 page essay? I think you mean a 500 word essay. A 500 page essay would be impossible for a kid to write that big an essay in just a few days. That's the length of certain Stephen King books
i have to be honest, fresh prince aint a cartoon
Although this is outside of racism in cartoons, one interesting lesson that I was surprised to even see was on an episode of dinosaur where it was about drugs. You'd expect the episode to end when they burn it, but then you hear "CUT" and you see the studio finishing and you see that the crew members are also dinosaurs 😂 but one interesting thing was how robbie then goes on to just say how yeah drugs are bad but immediately goes on to the fact that there are other shows like the dinosaurs TV series that do these kinds of drug episodes, almost as if the creators feel pressured to do one after seeing another show, which I find pretty true as most of them follow the same format and never really show anything new than just trying to say "drugs are bad don't do drugs" without really showing the consequences of them and true reality, which made me then look back at the episode and see that the entire episode was like a parody or poking fun at those episodes you see on TV sitcoms
I honestly hate that Fresh Prince episode - it only perpetuates a victim mentality that does nothing but put people in harm's way on both sides of the spectrum.
Ok, this is just a weird little detail, but the blue jacket that Raven is wearing in that particular episode of that’s so Raven, looks heavily influenced by the American army, specifically during the mid to late 19th century. It’s the same uniform that the Union army wore during the civil war. The side that fought for the freedom of slaves. Also, the confederates were literally separatists (democratic side) fighting against the main US (Republican). I just have a weird fascination with military uniforms and couldn’t help but notice that. Also… what is that, in the back of your room… is it Danny Devito? It scares me. 🫣
You the man tuv!! Happy soon to be b-day!!
ok
is anyone else having trouble watching this video? for whatever reason, certain parts refuse to load
3:52 I was definitely in that situation before very relatible
50,000th like. Really love the video cause the way shows go about this topic can be very impacting, especially for children. Thank you for making this
everyone bleeds the same colour, racism is stupid it like two children arguing over the right way to colour in a picture, truth is  it doesn't matter
11:52 these tweets are like cancer, just less whimsical
Wanna know something weird I noticed. When I was watching his like other videos like the songs that have disturbing meanings behind them. Something like that. How YouTube name, is in alphabetical order. Like: a b c d e f g h i h k l m n o p, q r s T U V w x, y and z. Get what I am saying?
you look like this guy Jamiroquai
Jimmy
I hate knitters?
yay 50/50
I remember watching the one abt raven in school and my black friend said he didn’t care abt the video and that it wasn’t taking the subject seriously so why should he which he got after school detention for
18:24 it was all fake be racist.                                  [Bad ending]
hello
tuv is there a ban appeal for your discord
happy birfday
I thin I can say for the Steven Universe one, it just feels unrealistic for someone to be accepting of gay couples, but not interracial couples.  I have never met someone against one but not the other in this fashion, if they had instead made it a homophobia PSA it would've been so much more effective.  I think it is also the fact people started seeing anti-racist for what it truly was: racism in reverse.  Anti-racism as a whole is arguing for discrimination against non-minorities now to make up for past discrimination.  All that does is divide the races further
Man, Steven universe tackling racism was a goofball moment
it was so CRINGE
Hey tuv you should do a video on jovani Vazquez
Lowkey we need a disturbing video from you Do the hello kitty murder case
Racists was being ingrained by the environment they raised, making fun of different cultures and skin colors.  For example, if you have a family of almost all exclusively fair skinned people, and you have a dark-skinned sibling, and you call that sibling racial slurs, that is racism.  We must train ourselves to be open-minded upon different skin colors, different faiths and different cultures.
I think it might need better to put “racism approached in kids shows” instead of “cartoons” bc a lot of these are kids sitcoms.
this channel is like a btec blameitonjorge
Hey kids, don’t be racist
Arthur has a new principal? What happen to the previous one?
Remember the times when we weren't allow it talk about topics like racism in kids show because they thought it was too explicit for younger viewers until George Floyd's murder happened?
tuvs avatar looks like a emo bachira LO
hi nice contents, are u Fil-Am?
I never thought in a million years that the kid from a random video who was smoking the EDP pack would have this big of a channel and have such awesome content in the coming years. Congratulations dude. Inspirational stuff
Lol tuv got a weak chin 😅😂
This is my favorite YouTubeer
I could not sleep in the same room as that cutout😭
racism good
6:19 bruh what kinda ad placement is that💀
Even I knew it was All Wrong watching these as a Kid Back in the Day
When I saw John Lewis's head I couldn't stop laughing I laughed so much I burst a abscess on my jaw 🤣🤪🍀🤯🫠✌️
Pervert earl, what was he doing under the covers,Bad Earl 😂
tuv you remember me from the last comment?
14:57 Being in the Minority is difficult l, I'm not black, But I am an Autistic, Asexual, Closet Trans person, That use's Gender Neutral pronoun's {They/Them} To mask it, And it hurt's... My Family is Transphobic... Which is hurtful, I wish I could have a Romantic Lesbian Relationship, But sadly, My Family  is Transphobic... And it's  really difficult, Being in the Minority, As there is a high Chance that  the Majority, Will Mock an Bully {And even badly hurt} People of the Minority... Which is terrible, Don't be Transphobic, Don't be Acephobic, Don't be Homophobic, Don't be against the LGBTQIA+ Community, Don't be $*x!$t, And in this video's context, Don't be racist, Be Respectful of all race's, We are all human~
3:45 That's most dinner's for me, As we don't really speak at Dinner {At Least not me} Not alot at least, But yeah, I can see how that is just... Awkward, Also... *RACISM* *F*€K!N9 SUCK'S* People should not be Racist... I wanted to Say that  I hate Racism, No matter  what, Respect people~
your voice sounds fine
tuv looks like that one friend who talks serious but is very funny 👍
I’m not going to lie. Arthur’s episode stereotyped John Lewis by giving him a big nose, lips and rough face 😂😂
“bLaCk PeOpLe CaNt MaRrY wHiTe PeOpLe” I know it’s wrong but that shi got me cracking up💀
I CAN'T WAIT FOR EARL PLUSH🔥🔥🔥🔥
Happy birthday bro
Did you know that EDP reacted to your stuff cuz you smoked his pack you have to watch the interview for that one
I really dig your little Turkey Tom-style cartoon tuv! And also your face! 50/50 is a perfect compromise for everyone ❤ So keep up the good work kid, it's nice to see a vid from you ☺️
It took me a second to find out the white woman was racist
I think the issue is that in the last 5 years we've had a situation that is less one way racism and more a race war. People need to go outside and actually get to know what's happening. There are racists of all colors, and white people don't exactly have an advantage at the moment. The general opinion of the population has devolved to "black people are a minority, therefore it isn't as bad when they're racist as when white people are. Taking a stand against black racists as well as white ones is bad because we need to even the playing field." In reality, most people aren't racist. Outside of a little middle of nowhere town in the south I lived in once, I haven't been able to find many traces of racism. When I ask people to describe times they've experienced racism it's usually something like "someone looked at me funny in a store once." If you follow someone around and tell them "the sky is blue" over and over again they'll eventually get angry and say "no, the sky isn't blue" out of spite. When you tell people that racism is bad over and over when they already know, some get pissed and say racist things. That's basically the entire story of modern racism. Some people are contrarians, and act racist out of spite at being told racism is bad so much. Not that there aren't actual cases of racism, but most racism is just random spiteful trolls that have had enough of being told the same thing over and over again
Could you do the funniest episodes of kids cartoons?
I think static shock and at one point the proud family were able to handle the subject perfectly as they never hamfested the message in the first place
Why did you title this Cartoons when there are live action shows on here 😂
Great video tuv! Keep up the great content.
"Fresh Prince" and "That's so Raven" are not cartoons.
Teen Titans and Static Shock.
14:14 Im Hispanic and i've(Ima try to sound humble) lived a more privileged life than many white people, I also have a lot of Hispanic friends that don't have it that hard, so that statement is bs.
YOUR MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER TUV
18:21 should have been “boys can’t marry boys” but this version garnet isn’t there. My point is I’m homophobic
I loved Steven Universe’s approach
Ohhh hell nah the steven universe one was terrible and I like Steven universe
Just started watching your content. I absolutely love your videos !! And your music is sick a’f ❤❤ I am happy I found a new YouTuber to watch 😊😊
I remember that episode of bel air
Arthur was an aardvark?!? Bro I never knew animal he was. 😭
6:27 hi earl
I like you’er no face tattoo
brooooooo when did tuv turn into an animation, looking dope
God the one at the bottom right. The dislike ratio was horrendous
0:33 totally off topic but his bape stas in the back 🤩🤩
April is coming up soon so do the opposite of what you do
Now this is a story all about my life got twisted upside down, and I’d like to take a minute to sit down here and talk about the fresh prince of Bel-air.
danny devito being ignored in the background<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Don't worry tuv we love your face so the pressure thing I know it's not that easy but don't feel pressure we love you
happy late birthday!! 🎉
You didn’t know will smith played with smith bruh how 😭😭
When I was in 7th grade, we read a book called The Skin I'm In. It's about a middle schooler who gets bullied because of her skin color and doesn't think she's beautiful because of her differences. It's a great book that talks about the everyday struggles of a person of color!
BLACK PEOPLE CANT MARRY WHITE PeOpLe
He’s so different from his tiktok vids 💀😭
stop postin the "art" bruhhh 💀
The last one reminds me of the lunch sit in
Damn thats so raven it's a cartoon?
Here’s an idea, the saddest scenes in cartoons
I (like the majority of people) also like your face more than the character. It feels more real and genuine. Plus you're cute asf no homo 😩
That one episode of static shock was a really good episode
The editing 🤩🙏🏽😇😇😇
16:16 my school was on the news after being renamed to be John Lewis
"Cartoons"
Can you not use profanity? I could not even watch the whole video. So offensive and so unnecessary.
The charater vs face thing doesn't matter to me at least! I'm usually doing homework while watching.
Make a video on the dancing Serbian lady
You should do banned South Park or family guy episodes
The topic is supposed to be about "Racist Moments in Cartoons" but Fresh Prince and That's So Raven are NOT cartoons! And Sesame Street, while being a kids show is also NOT a cartoon!🤦🏼‍♀️😆
i didnt know who i was watching before clicking the vid and saw that character animation and was thinking hey that looks like tuv plus the voice put 2&2 tg, great job on the resemblance haha !
If you do start using more PNG images in the future, maybe get some more facial expressions. Face cam is a little preferred just because facial expressions for me make what is being said a little easier to understand. 50 50 is a good balance tho! Once again maybe get some more facial expressions. Kinda like how code bullet does his stuff!
Happy birthday Tuv! 🎉
can you do a vid of your shoe collection
Bro make a different channel for your shorts as shorts somewhat decreases reach and also it doesn't look good for the newer audience who's scrolling through your video section. <3
happy birthday!!!!!!
Please don't become a png tuber 😢
Bro turned into a semi pngtuber
keep your face tuv
Great video/topic and appreciate the effort to be more consistent! Enjoying the content about cartoons especially since so many people here grew up with these various shows that had influence on  the reality that we grew up with. To be honest don't hear an audio difference between real Tuv and cartoon Tuv,  just put that mic up higher kind sir - no issues if it lies just below the chin. Keep up the great work though, there is a reason for the great growth in this channel's popularity!
Happy birthday
Thank you iceberg guy for approaching the subject of racism in cartoons
I love that i remember all of these cause i used to watch them
Superchoque é foda
Damn bro these cartoons😭😭 W video tuv one of my favourite YouTubers 🤞
8:10 this made me laugh so hard
Cartoon??? Fresh prince is a cartoon man that is more important than this
Happy birthday tuv!!!!
I love that these videos remind me of old blameitonjorge videos
Happy birthday tuv 🎉
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
HAPPY BDAY EARL!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
the old music is back thank you
Yoo tuv happy birthday 🎉
Happy B-Day 😼
Bro someone is behind you
my fellow earls unite
Nice leafy reference lmao
I’m sorry, 500 PAGE ESSAY?!?!
As a black person this is great.
Bro, my man has to do a 500 page essay, poor kid
But wait some of these aren’t cartoons 🧐🫠
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TUVVV  hope you got to spend it with friends
Is that a cardboard cut out of Danny Devito behind you? 😂
And what about men painting their nails.
Great video. Just subscribed
tuv back with another goood video🙏
Happy birthday
TUV WENT CHIBBY, WTF      (I have nothing against it it's just scared me cuz I thought I subscribed to a channel without knowing)
I agree with how he said they seem to push it too much which is mostly the more recent ones. The rest were good though
Talk about amphibia season 2 episode 20 you won’t regret it it is also called true colors
who is that in  the background
Happy birthday!
OMG, is that one of your familiars behind you
OMG, is that one of your familiars behind you
Tuvington
Yeah I think the first Stephen Universe PSA did anti-racism a disservice by combining two big issues into one. Even with LGBT out of the equation, racism can be encountered in many ways beyond just romantic relationships.
The one thing that scares me most is that the art style your character has is similar’s to someone I seen before 😨
The Nega Chin?!?!
Happy birfday!
I like how some cartoons aren’t afraid to tackle real life issues and teach children why these issues are bad in the first place. That way the kids become more aware of what is actually going on in today’s world.
going home after school is one of the most stressful things i have to deal with every week. i have no idea what my dad’s mood is, he’s either quiet and awkward or angry and hot headed for no particular reason, at least to me i guess. i cried when i first saw this short it’s too relatable 😭
happy birthday, Tuv! 🥳
Happy birthday tub :D !
Dude don't let the weirdo fanbase turn you off from Steven Universe. It's a great show, the later seasons and Future, plus the movie, are all really great. And the best thing about it is the music. One year my top artist from Spotify wrapped was Steven Universe.
I recently rewatched The Fresh Prince of Bellaire, and although it is really iconic and still got some funny jokes here and there, the half to the end of the show is filled with "haha woman bad lol" jokes and bits that gets a quite annoying after some time.
Bruv
I ACCIDENTLY CLICKED DISLIKE T-T-T-T-T TUV IM SORRY BRUV
Happy birthday tuv!!
tuvington 😂
I loves the Fresh Prince episode, as a black person myself I love the way the episode played out, Carlton being the innocent one not realizing racism will affect him and *is*, it’s really heart wrenching how the episode ended as well..
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TUV
Correction: Uncle Phil is a judge. THE judge!
all i know is the newest proud family is horseshit compared to these
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TUV!!!!
Hey, um Tuv.. I don’t wanna alarm you.. but there’s a guy standing right behind you 😬
It's a catch 22, we have the freedom of speech and freedom of idea, so doesn't that apply to racism too? Racists have their right to free speech and free will
Bro be careful, i think danny devito might have broken into your home
The way Carlton acted, was how I felt when I was harassed by a white customer at my own job. Growing as a Christian conservative Mexican, while believing all the akt right ideals like "racism is over." Far from it. That was the first of several racial altercations I would have as a grown up and would then wake me up to America.
damn the editing  as an editor i approve 🔥
Why do all these examples only involve black people? What about others like asians or hispanics?
came here to tell you, you were in my dream last night
Bro what, taking just a robots word on anything is word on anything is bad my guy. He's been called out for his own racist actions and giving im this shout out is going to give him more fuel to make videos that defend saying racist shit in the name of comedy.
You should use earl as your character
happy birthday tuv!
might get hate but imo, it didnt really matter that they were gay. The girl didnt say ''Black guys cant marry white guys''.
Idk if you seen the new video about the proud family reboot and the song they did about slaves building the country
That episode of SpongeBob where Sandy dared the guys to walk onto dry land.
Yo
happy birthday
If Fresh Prince is included, the episode of A Different World that dealt with it both scared and saddened me as a child.
If you're just looking for cartoons that are weird to that suggest courage cow to dog code leoco generator racks
Netflix alr did this but I was wondering if u could do a video on the murdaugh murders
Your parents should teach you to respect everyone not a cartoon 💯
bro turned into a vtuber
Happy Early Birthday Tuv Wish you the best birthday!
i remember  static shock i remember liking it richie gay in the comics  Interracial gay kids on steven universe
❤😊
6:18 I just came
Where is the pink,green,red,purple,blue hair? I swear he had rainbow hair
Richies mom is thick tho
happy bday dude we share one! 🤓🤓🎂
happy birth day :D
Happy birthday tuv
you  forgot the super Mario  bros shows  episodie about mushroom
The Arthur episode wasn't about racism though. It was mostly about mistreated workers. Ms. Tingley was just being a bitch.
People were also annoyed at the SU psas because one of them was dishing out actual racism and misinformation by claiming we only say Thomas edison invented the light bulb because he was a white guy and the actual credited inventor should be Lewis Latimer for inventing the filament, which is like saying every atom related discover and invention should be credited to Democritus for making a theory on atoms first.
I thought this was going to be about the blatantly racist cartoons that I grew up with that are so terrible when you watch them now. This is cool too though.
I only disagree slightly with you on the depiction of Mr John Lewis in Arthur. His character adds an air of seriousness without being frightening to young children (IMHO).  Love your vids; love the gauges: cheers 💚
How about cartoons that causes controversy?
Hey Tuv. It is 12am here were I live & I want to say happy birthday. Congrats on being 21 & continue enjoying your day/night 🎉
Happy Birthday Tuv!
The first two got a chuckle out of me how you said “I like how they tackled racism”. Mainly because they tackled racism by… simply showing a situation with racism. I’m not sure what other way there is to tackle it.  Sesame Street was fine in the original because it’s just saying racism is bad. The newer version, you didn’t really show what happened so I can’t judge for myself. But was surprised that all we got in regards to the comments was “I’ll assume that’s what all the dislikes were about” but no commentary on what they did or could do to receive different or better feedback. The comments looked like they were upset that, in order to teach one lesson, they used tactics that they felt were also harmful in other ways. I can see a debate about whether or not this is true and would likely be based on personal stance. But if you can debate about it at all, then it missed the mark.  The Fresh Prince one was deep. Probably the best one because it makes sense for Carlton to not get it because he grew up rich and spoiled. And I think it’s cool for Uncle Phil to see Will’s idea play out and be like “WTF???” only to come around and be like “Oohhhh…. No he’s actually right this time.”  The Arthur one is… I mean ok. Random?  And the Steven Universe one didn’t seem that bad to me, but I will admit that at first glance I would expect the PSA to be about homophobic rhetoric, which is a little more modern topical than racism since, which racism still exists, most people are generally already against racism. It’s literally taboo. Homophia is too but there’s a lot more people still against it because they actually because it makes sense to be. And the lesson? “No. That’s bad. ….BECAUSE.” It doesn’t teach anything. They just bring it up and say it’s bad. It’s kinda manipulative and brainwashy. Not the best way to encourage a moral lesson. I think it also rubs people the wrong way who respond to certain exaggerations only to be told they’re also racist or part of the problem etc etc. Like the people pulling the race card are somehow ALWAYS right. Because the PSA basically relegates their place in all this as nothing more than the mere silly ignorant whitey. He wasn’t even actually racist himself. lol So there’s probably better ways they coulda had it play out to deliver the message.
Yes kids should learn about real life problems but another side of me is saying no if we are giving cartoons full control of what they teach kids then what if they teach them something bad I know it’s unlikely but better be safe then sorry as many people nowadays are grooming children to push stuff no kid should learn about at that age
To be honest I could see why people didn't like the 1st Steven universe psa because I believe that racism is something that you are born into while that LBGTQ is something that you choose to be Or to put it simply racism against skin color is a more serious matter and should be focused on first (respectfully) and shouldn't be compared to unequally against LBGTQ
The first show I ever saw that mentioned racism was Davey and Goliath’s episode “blind man’s buff” it featured Davey a white kid becoming friends with his friend Jonathan’s cousin Scottie. Scottie and Jonathan are black. Scottie temporarily lost his eye sight due to a science experiment. Scottie’s eye sight comes back and when he finds out Davey is white he gets really upset and the episode ends with them making up after Davey convinced Scottie that people of different skin colors can be friends. There’s also a scene where Davey’s little sister is confused why Scottie doesn’t want to be friends with them and Davey explains it’s because they’re white and his little sister says “we’re not white we’re pink. Paper is white.”  If you couldn’t guess Davey and Goliath is a very religious show which is why it had a white person teaching a black person on racism😅
the PNG looks very cool
Omg I love u tuv
Who else fucks wit the Kool-Aid Man
Am I the only one who find it weird how the mom in the first one mom reacts to the situation? She doesn't seem to share the racism that her husband has and seems ashamed to the point where she's fine with the static shock dude coming over. Yet, she's still quiet when the dad shows up. Why did she marry this guy? Does he hurt her? I never saw the show, so sorry if I mixed up the names.
2:08 what duh hell Ishowspeed in a cartoon!11
Also Teen Titans had an episode where StarFire had to deal with racism
happy early birthday, tuv!
Personally, I think it would have been stronger if the store manager in That's So Raven said "your kind" instead of "black people," because it'd be more realistic
“That’s why I love cartoons” -👨🏻‍🦳
This is evil
I think most of these handled it well but Arthur was so bad
Seeing the intro made me remember the dislike bar, anyone remember that
Smart Guy (on Disney+) is one of my fav shows and they also had an ep on s3e10 called “Get a Job”. Evette and her friend get a job at a retail store in their senior yr of HS. Their mgr is white and orders Evette’s friend (also white) to go about and spy on any black persons shopping in the store, meanwhile Evette is busy being the only one ringing up clients. I’m the end, the mgr is caught and reported to the higher ups for racial profiling by the girls and gets disciplined by her Superior. Smart Guy is one of my all time fav shows that I watch back 2 back every yr 🥰
This isnt related to racism or anything, but I noticed that one of the actors in the second show you talked about, is the same actor from Cory in the house (Kyle Massey). Idk if you made a video about the situation hes been in fairly recently but if you haven't It would be interesting too see that.
I love you animated character it look real ❤❤❤
wait he’s hot …
Tuv, why does your thing say 10 subs?? You tryna guilt trip us?
Does anyone also feel like tuv sounds better when his mic is down cuz then it’s too loud?
the tuv sprites are cool
I prefer the Teen Titans way of dealing with racism than Static Shock. Because even after Starfire saves the other alien dude, he doesn't magically forget his bigotry, and it's not suddenly all alright. All he's willing to budge on his that _she's_ good for her "kind" and treats it like he deserves praise for being so forward thinking. Starfire pushes back that Tamaranians everywhere are not some pest that need to prove their worths to validate them, then of course the racist's mask comes back off.  Racism is not something that can be solved by the targets proving their worth to the bigot, bigots don't suddenly chanhe because you afford them the decency they won't afford you. All you can do is call them out and not search for their approval.
shows showing how discrimination happens is good but wtf is Steven universe and their bullshit "anti-racist"
dude i just stumbled upon this website called "instant checkmate" because i was just trying to find my dad's info about his business, and it looks really scammy. can you do a deep dive into this website? it's creepy at first but i know it's fake and possible scammed a lot of people hoping to find "strange info" about their search subject. be careful please
gay marriage is illegal
My views are the exact opposite of tuv on Steven universe I grew up a couple years watching CN before Steven universe came out and. I never liked Steven universe especially the shitty animation style and personalities of all the charcters.
Static shock is top teir
THATS WHAT IM SAYING ☠️ 3:44
Static Shock 🔥🔥🔥 also lovin the comeback of animation videos (or a video)
give your P,N,G lore!
bro wtf is that character drawing
I like how they tackled racism in Seasme Street, Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Stasic Shock in a welcoming way.
the intro was so chaotic 🤣🤣🤣
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY TUVINGTONNNNN 😻😻😝😝
this is random BUT SOMEONE GOTTA MENTION HOW AMAZING THE NEW EDITING STYLE IS....LIKE WOW
Was dying for him to talk abt We Got To Celebrate Our Differences
The purl one was pretty bad
Question: I'm a native American/Amish and I'm just not that into black guys. It's not anything to do with them, just a personal opinion.
Honestly, I like how shows can talk about very serious topics in a mature manner. Plus, I'd listen and watch an entire cartoon pointing out racism with a straight on plot. It's honestly important to learn about what racism is and how it can affect people in a very strong way
Why does the earl plushie looks like Greg heffley
love these new intros
u cute
man steven universe was such a great tv show it was most definitely top 10 cartoon network
Plot Twist: The Racist in Sesame Street was Oscar the Grouch.
I love the new animation style
I hate that this even a conversation.  Fuck hate.  Thank you for making this though.
If you do a part two, you should cover the one episode of teen titans where starfire is discriminated.
What’s up Broski 🦋
18:25 its all fake. Be racist.
I don’t know why I thought that was a real old man in the back of the room.
MLP:FiM did not pull punches, and was never afraid to talk about serious subjects, and racism was not the exception. “The Times They Are A Changeling” (The title obviously parodies one of my favorite songs) shows that even if a group’s leader is evil, that does not mean all members of the group are like that, a lesson sadly forgotten nowadays. The series finale’s first part, “The Ending of the End”, also discusses prejudice, with the three villains spreading lies about the three pony kinds, leading the kinds to care only for themselves and abandon friendship.  And of course, we have to mention the fifth generation of the franchise, which succeeded G4 (of which FiM was the main media component) and for the first time in the franchise’s history tool part in the same universe as its predecessor. It continues with the theme the last episode I mentioned touched on, being set in the far future where the three pony kinds are separated by prejudice. The film that kickstarts this generation, “My Little Pony: A New Generation”, has been divisive for how it treats the subject and specifically for its protagonist tries to solve the conflict, but it is impressive that they chose to start their new generation of the franchise with this theme.
I always disliked how they only seem to focus on racism against African Americans and in this video it’s all I see. I would’ve loved to see examples of other races like my own.
Earl reminds me of "Kilroy was here"
Tuv.. THIS VIDEO WAS SOOOO GOOOD!!
I thought this was a Tommy (nasu) video
I need to see a bluey episode where a cat is hating against a dog
It was big bird! 📞
The best one was Teen Titans where Starfire learned it doesn’t matter what other people think, it’s the ones you care about that matter. Your friends and family. There will always be people that are jerks. They don’t matter in your life. With that there was also the lesson from MLK, the content of the character is more important than the color of your skin. That in turn changes the hearts and minds of people. Even that guy from TT started to change, he was still racist but he made a small step because Starfire saved him in spite of his actions towards her.   For some reason we went from that lesson to the opposite. All that seems to matter is the color of your skin. Whites people are always racists because of their skin color for instance. It’s the same as assuming all black people are criminals.   There was also another episode of Fresh Prince that shows another problem. When pledging a black fraternity, Carlton was singled out to get the most hazing and he still didn’t get into the frat. The reason is because he “wasn’t black enough.” That he acted like a white person and that was wrong. Fortunately, that guy was called out by another member who was gonna get him kicked out.  I have a long time family friend who went to college was super intelligent and at one time lived in the ghetto. We were bringing him food and stuff because he had 4 kids and his wife ran out on them and was having a hard time. He came running out his house telling us NEVER to come down there without him again. And went from this well spoken man to using Ebonics when telling his neighbors we were with him. Never heard him talk like that before. He said you can’t let them know you’re educated there. It’s seen as “too white.”  He’s going great now. Lives in a big fancy house, last kid went to college. Other son is in the military. He’s a very happy and successful man like the Banks family. But he’d be seen as a kind of race traitor if his old neighborhood saw him. And that’s wrong.  Racial tensions have heightened in recent years. In spite of the tremendous strides we’ve made. We even had a black president. But now that the lesson is you have to reject anything “white” because all whites are racists and anything they built is too, it’s setting society back 50 years.  There needs to be a change and it starts with putting character>color again. Be colorblind. Accept there are jerks and move on.
He wasn't just a white man.  He got home early from WORK!
Why does he have to be white and not a hard working man that doesn't disrespect the law and women?
Tuv I think you should make a video about mic’d up Youtubers and the really dangerous stuff that happens when they record such as Jidion and Kanal Joseph
Yes, i love race. Im racist
There will never be an accurate representation of racism in american media. You always want to make yourselves feel good and thus you will never acknowledge that it isn't just white people doing it and non whites suffering from it. Go to a non white country and see what they are like. Racism is the norm but you will never acknowledge it.
I like that Fresh Prince of Bel-Air doesn’t just have a happy ending. Unfortunately that happens too often in the real world
Awesome hoodies, you can wear em - tuv
666k views I came at the perfect time
the steven universe prolly got dislike bombed because of the obliviousness or simply because mfs can’t handle anything that isn’t even slightly out of the norm and call everything woke brainlessly
That’s so Raven was my favorite show ever!!!! 😭😭😭❤️ the nostalgia is real
Meow 🐱
Dark Meanings behind Children's Cartoons. Please!
I don’t think any shows have talked about racism against white people why do you think that is???
I love the Arthur knitter episode out of context
i like how they added the lgbtq but doesn't shove it, though the entire show is kinda cringe. i mean in the whole show, but that "dont be racist kids" was way to shoved
"Smart Guy" had a really cool episode on racism and racial profiling in a shoplifting episode as well. Btw, you're really hot - no disrespect. Loving this channel!
Gonna have to hard-disagree on a fundamental-fucking-level with anyone who says that the message of the first Steven Universe PSA is undermined by the kids being gay… which is a weird sentence to actually type out. Anyway, that’s the whole problem the LGBTQ+ community faces; they can’t just exist and be seen without it being a focus, it’s always treated as some separate phenomenon that “should” or “shouldn’t” be happening. Couples should just be couples. If two blokes fall in love and started dating, they’re just a couple, not a “gay couple.” If the kids portrayed in the PSA wanted to grow up and get married, it should just be a marriage, not a “gay marriage.” It’s ironic as fuck to me that people can’t seem to understand that anytime and everytime they treat ANY minorities, racial or otherwise, as separate or different in ANY UNNECESSARY WAY, you’re creating a divide that’s at best unnecessary, and at worst actively harmful. That’s how you create a prejudicial “us vs them” environment.  No social issues or societal pressures exist within a vacuum, and it’s not like the lack of support over interracial marriage shown in that PSA is some archaic issue of a bygone era, or even that concerns for it had no reason to be depicted alongside a marriage between a same-sex couple. Marriage between interracial couples in the US was legalised until the late 1950s (so fun fact: some people born before the legalisation are still alive), however, its legality was only held through a Supreme Court interpretation of the 14th amendment, which could’ve just as easily be overturned in a new ruling. Marriage between same sex couples was outright banned in the 90s on a federal level, and had only existed in the US for the last 20ish years by individual state laws legalising it. However, like interracial marriage, states ability to legalise marriage between same sex couples was entirely up to the Supreme Court’s interpretation of, here it is again: the 14th amendment. It wasn’t until December of last year— literally 4 MONTHS ago— that marriage between interracial couples and marriage between same sex couples (which I will point out:  aren’t mutually exclusive) became fully, federally legalised. Those two issues are LITERALLY as intertwined as the hands being held between the kids in that PSA.  Treating racism and homophobia, or marriage equality between interracial couples and marriage equality between same sex couples, or even just prejudice against racial minorities and prejudice against the LGBTQ+ community, as separate issues that cannot be recognised together is to ignore the core of both racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights: any. Unnecessary. Divide. Is. Prejudice. You must. Treat ALL people. Equally. Regardless of race, sexual orientation, sex, gender, disability, social class, or otherwise.
the steven universe psa failed for me because the jingle was too good
Does it look like I give a fuck
please don't switch to cartoon tuv
The anti-racism PSA featuring Garnet is the one people bring up most often but I really love the two shorts you didn’t mention that feature Pearl and Amethyst.  In Pearl’s short, she argues that we should do a lot more to represent black people in history than just giving facts that they exist.  In Amethyst’s short, she and the kids agree that just because people of different races should be treated equally doesn’t mean they are all the same since they have a wide variety of cultures and face many different kinds of racism.  I’m really impressed with how these shorts handled this topic.
Talk about lookin like (I wanna kill my parents) 😂😂😂😂
9:45 "I don't really think Sesame Street needs an introduction, so I'm not gonna do one." Historians in 3023: Oh, God Dammit!
Tbh I thought the Steven universe psa was gonna be anti gay instead of being anti racist especially since garnet was there :/
Family Matters is one
0:39 me clapping:👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
“Honestly I didn’t give a fuck” 💀
Racism doesn’t exist! Point blank. Yea there are some idiots who judge others by how they look. But to say America is racist is crazy. Like you have have more black millionaires then EVER before. So let’s stop with this notion
TUV FINALLY POSTED LETTTSSSS GO
I’m so happy you went back to making good content and putting your music on another channel. LOVE YOUR CONTENT!! Not so much your music but hey everyone has their own taste of music.
Boyo how many platforms did you put your song on🐒
Promotion/ad ends at 7:12
They only ever talked about racism but my general curiosity is if there is any show that also explains reverse racism and why people do it and the events for that to happen.
YOU SHOULD DO ANOTHER VIDEO GAME VIDEOOO
Theres a great fresh prince episode where will and carlton try to get accepted into a frat and only will gets accepted cause carlton acts "too white" if you ever do a second vid id def recommend watching that episode.
If they want to add racism and sexism in cartoons and movies this is how they do it. Not letting it get in the way of telling a good story and not shoving it in the audience’s face.
Technically Will Smith doesn’t play himself in fresh prince because his name is Willard while in the show it’s William lmao
I think it’s obvious I’ve never seen any of these episodes
i remember when static shock also went over the issue of bullying and school shootings. i learned a lot from that show
I like to see your face more tuv
Virgil’s mother died from gun violence as well which is a reason why he hates guns
That's So Raven handled racism pretty well, unlike Raven Simoné's, ahem.... not so stellar comment she mad a while back. If you know, you know.
What racism?
When your mic is close you sound like christopher griffin
@tuv it’s my bday tomorrow to
I think me and others would love to see another controversial video video game video! Also I  the png and while as a creator you do have some obligation to serve your viewers, if it’s your comfort then you should do what’s best. That way we get better content and the best you.
My cusson used to force me to wach thats so raven.
I've seen them as a kid. They're still funny and entertaining episodes that blended with the rest of the show. I remember it feeling real and honestly probably prevented racism on a sub conscious level.
who is the dude behind you
THE SESAME STREET ONE REALLT HTOUGHT IT DID SOMETHING....
Can you cover Jack Stauber?
😭
1:48 💀💀
Bro why is there a friggen old man in Ur background at the back💀
Tuvington
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET A EARL PLUSH
Ah yes, my favorite "cartoons" that's so Raven and the fresh Prince of belair
im born in 1990 and they aired ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire'' on a Danish Channel (i'm Greenlandic and the channel had Danish subs), where i didn't understand Danish, but I grew up with it and even I understood there was a racial undertone in that episode and PS: i love that you said ''Uncle Phil'', the 80-90's kids will always call him that and RIP James Avery aka Uncle Phil
I never else that episode of Arthur I just thoug- nah think about nothing when watching cartoons TV shows
Ok im curious how do you do the research for these vids like Do you watch a bunch of shows or do you google stuff
King of the hill was amazing also
I’m not sure how Arthur could tackle racism when it’s about animals but they somehow did
do 90/10 plz i dont like the fake tuv
bro I thought WIll smith's (the character) was named prince
I subbed on this video. I love that, you’re transparent and the content you provide is honest and unafraid to touch social taboos. 🎉 Look forward to seeing you again soon.
the new song is fire!!! also i love the character its adorable just like you!
Bro just make the mic horizontal so the sound can be better with camera on with showing ur chin bruh ❤ also 🔥Babestas 🔥
im dead 💀 bro was like: honestly on first look... i didnt give A FUCK !
The sweatshops making earl merch are a whole lot better now 🙏
Static shock has some WEIRD villains
Tuv this month I turned ten for my birthday my freinds and me caught pedos on omegle😂
I enjoy your videos and would like to see you do a video on Elsagate! Please spread awareness about these things
the negative response to the steven universe psa has everything to do with the audiences homophobia and nothing to do with being "too progressive" lmfao. If we can be anti racist, we can be anti homophobic.
My only critique is why Live Action shows are included since the topic is about Racisim handled in "Cartoons". If "That's So Raven" is a Cartoon, then "Corey In The House" is actually an Anime.
I hope who ever is reading this will become successful in life my dream is to become a successful rapper one day
I think this was such a good take on everything. Nice even responses bro
No one gonna talk about the guy behind him
tuvington
fresh prince is no joke probably one of the best sitcoms that came from that time. absolutely hilarious, but they werent afraid to tackle some bigger issues too. infact, i think they tackled a lot of different issues throughout their run.
The one that stuck out for me in the FPoBA, is when Carlton is shunned by a frat guy for being too "white." But Will not taking any of that BS stands up for him.
if you ever make a Part 2 to this, you should include the Troq episode from Teen Titans :0
You should talk about captain planet and the planteers this show has several episodes on gang violence one of which has a whole drive by shooting scene an episode on drug abuse where a character dies of an overdose an episode on AIDS and many other episodes on important topics and controversial issues about polluting the planet or yourselves by doing drugs ect
just let the plush overtake your channel and get into my bed ;)  HAHAHAHAHAHA- I DIDNT EXPECT THAT TO SOUND  LIKE THAT-
Good Video, definitely liking and Subscribing
i think using your face on the intros of topics and the end of topics is fine and as your explaining use the characters
I feel like too many cartoons that approach racism, only consider the whites being racist against blacks experience. Like what about discrimination against asians, hispanics, africans, jews, australians, native americans, etc.  See? It's not just a 1-way street.
There was a good episode of teen titans that explored it with starfire. Another alien works with the team, everyone’s impressed by him and he’s very respectful to everyone but her. He starts giving her names, lashing out, etc even though she’s performing just as well as the others. Eventually the malicious nature comes to light and cyborg has a heart to heart with her, but where I feel they drop the ball is when he says “of course I get it, I’m part robot” which is more about ablism (explored in another episode) and not his ethnicity.
Happy early 2 day birthday
the lil character dude is honestly adorable , n even though its cool seeing ur face if u like the character more id enjoy watching the character more knowing that
Don't feel pressure fam you cute bro...ayyooo😂😂
Anyone else see a chunky balding guy with glasses, dark shirt, and light grey pants leaning against the wall on the left in the back? 😳
Tuv being consistant is great, almost like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Dude looks like the type of YouTube to be caught grooming 15 year olds in the next 3 years
Can you make a video of the rise and fall of the OG Cartoon Network
I saw that Arthur episode a while ago. Honestly the message flew over my head.
i feel like in the Steven universe one ppl would be more mad over them being a gay couple / gay interracial couple rather than just black ppl marrying white ppl
I always end up coming back to tuv <3
Woah, the different intro style 👌🪝
19:43 i still hate this show tho
18:16 ohhhh the cringe it’s killing me
Tuv 10 subscribers
IM NOT A KNITTER
I love and appreciate this post, Ive heard of static shock. Might have to check it out.
3:54 what the ? Fuck you mr
2:58 tell that to super man who literally wears no mask  Instead he only takes his glasses off  Like this show is also under the dc property  So is everyone in the dc universe dumb when they see superheroes and don’t recognize them as regular people they know ?
Yeah
nah man i dont mean to be rude but you look like if jesse pinkman and theo von had a child along with some random mexican teen.
you look like rat moustache noel miller
Been here since you were around 50k, I love your videos. Best vids fr
Turkey tom.
Although I'm not part of LGBTQ group but I'm also a fan of Steven Universe by keeping the plot progress later on until coming out which makes me from less concern to being enjoyed.  Until after the release of Hogwarts Legacy, only Trans I no longer show tolerance because it starts when using the Author's background to justify boycott and it failed, Trans activist on Twitter rallied the community to named and Harrassed any streamers who played this game which has gone too far instead of fighting for their rights, it's a huge wave of "Cisphobia" which act like this word doesn't exist
Personally the reason I didn't like the Steven universe PSA was because the issue they picked is too outdated. Yes back in the 1940s and before interracial marriage was frowned upon. But now the only people who would truly see an issue with it are probably extreme Bible bashing Christians, most young people don't care. Also, if someone dislikes interracial couples then there's a high chance they dislike gay people too. The others were better
Modern leftists have made the word "racist" meaningless
BRING HIM BACK TO PEWDIEPIE, YOU THIEF
Thanks
Man Will Smith looked goofy back then 🤣😂 no racism though
Love the video idea, Tuv. Glad to see you're back posting regularly and hope all is well with you. Also, I'm happy as long as I just get to see that beautiful face at least once a video :)  [Edit] I agree, that John Lewis face is definitely giving me uncanny valley vibes
Tuv has gotta be the most humbled and charismatic commentary YouTuber despite covering dark topics
Bro please remove that fucking png its cringe af
Is Danny Devito chilling in the back corner of your room?
rip uncle phil
Only 3 out of 6 were cartoons? Haha
I thought this video was gonna be cartoon's being racist.....
Who invented racist theory and practice? Democrat slave holders ,then Democrats who founded the KKK,and wrote the Jim Crow Laws. Now it's kept alive by liberal woke whites and hate mongering blacks. Here's a thought....the people who hate black folks are other black folks. So Obama's Justice Dept ran a survey, over 600,000 dead black kids were shot by other black kids. Black women are 6.5% of the population of the United States, yet make up 40% of the nearly 1,000,000 abortions. Black Lives Matter to blacks?

Why can't they make shit like this anymore, this is all digestible and it's ok to have questions with shit but nowadays anything and everything is thrown in your face and you have to just nod along and act like you automatically understand and are ok with everything, or you're the worst person ever and get cancelled or some shit
Arthur did not air in 1994! It aired in 1996!
I think the best way to approach racial topics such as racism in a cartoon is by presenting it with ignorance not malice. If a 10 year old says that two people who are different races can be together because they don't look the same should be approached as that kid doesn't understand it very well, not like how Cartoon Network approached it with that weird Steven Universe ad.
That was more like a blowing raspberries sounds than a fart sound
I don't know if you would count this one but there is a power rangers time force episode when the quantum ranger told the other rangers that mutants don't deserve justice as human does because their monsters .
About the Steven Universe video: if the kids were straight would they be distracting from the point with their heterosexuality?
I was literally just thinking about the That’s so Raven episode today.. such a great show, loved that episode.
I'm gonna say it anyway, some of these aren't cartoons...
so much better than shorts
Best tackling of Racism I’ve ever seen in fiction was actually the recently released, Freedom Planet 2.   The main antagonists entire people were wiped out because of it.  And another of the antagonists is a “victim” of it himself.  (Although if you ask me I think his attitude is the reason his discrimination continues.)
We like your face more instead of the cartoon face lol
this video made me smile i love tuv uploads (proof im not a bot) hrih4g8hg84h9g4rhi4hug8ehiufhiuehiufhi4hihu

Fun Fact: The actor playing the cop who pulls Will and Carlton over is Hank Azaria who was in addition to this role portrays the voice of Police Chief Wiggum in The Simpsons as well as Moe  The Bartender
yooo when the ear candy cd dopping and where can i get it
Oh god, get over it🥶
Look who finally decided to post
15:14 1994? Actually, Arthur aired on PBS from October 7, 1996 to February 21, 2022.
Really can't stand racism being portrayed on t.v. shows and most movies because of how safe and predictable it is. Yeah Hollywood's go to approach is to have the token white racist doing something shitty. Can honestly say anytime they have racism coming from non white characters, they try to protray it in a defense mechanism spotlight, especially when it's non whites being racist to non whites.
turn the volume down tho
Omg you and izzy did a song together? We went to high school together that's awesome
The worst part is watching those early 2000s shows like static shock and seeing nothing has changed if anything only got worse.
Static is what helped me reach out about  dyslexia it still affects me pretty bad on the daily. Thankfully, everything has spell check and grammar check now it's not the best but it helps a lot
This man needs an award for charisma which is so ironic because he covers the darkest things.
I like the cartoon face of u like I said it looks like scott pilgrim from the comics 😁👍🏻
Remember, it's only racist if white people say it. Also, Fresh Prince shouldn't count as a kids show.
Hey man idk if you know what a cartoon is
I'll be honest, weren't all the special guests in Arthur just a little to human? They did the same with Matt Damon and Mr. Rodgers on the show too.
That's so Raven isn't a cartoon
Bruuuuuhhhhh that spirited away tattoo got me moist 😅
Ayya
I feel so bad for the voice characters 😢
We want your face 😐
RIP Leafy 💔
Omg tttuuuvvvvv you're channel is growing so much luv!! I'm so proud of you 😊❤️❤️
I grew up in a ultra orthodox Jewish community racism was weird in my community if you can even call it that as negative views towards other racial and religious groups were common but never manifested in behavior oddly enough my brother in law is half Native American and half Latino but because he is a convert my parents happily accepted him as their son but still have biased views against those people yet love my brother in law to death so yeah kinda weirs
Considering 90% of hate crime claims turn out to be made up, yes, racism isn't the problem cartoon animators claim it is.
Tbh I see nothing wrong with the first steven universe psa. There are interracial gay couples in real life lol
“Cartoon Tuv isnt real, he cant hurt you”  Cartoon Tuv:
Always a great video Tuv!
Tuv: joyful, fun, happy Bertie: depression, suicide, sad 💀
None of these are examples of real world racism. Every single example you showed is in every way Propaganda, but nice job showing how kids are indoctrinated into having the beliefs that we ant them to have, ie whites are racists towards blacks and others but no one is ever racists towards towards whites because apparently they own the world and created everything Evil.
bro why are most videos about racism focus mostly and or only on black people , O get it but... what about other minorities, or even us white guys. We're going through hell too
I'm not supporting racist ppl but why pit her saying that on the news? Is that at least a little much?
17:53 bro you can’t like a style that changes every frame.
love this vidfeo
I remember being younger and watching that episode of fresh prince of bel air which is weird bc i was way more into that so raven. I think i got the impact more from it. I do love how it pans out of Carlton symbolizing the realization.
Any Fresh Prince episode that rolled credits without music was a banger
Thomas the tank engine was racist af. With lots of sub-racism for good measure.  *The big and small engines about their sizes *colors *engines vs diesels *against other modes of transportation (even other sentient objects) Just to give some examples
Happy early birthday tuv
What about other races? There's more than just black and white, and this only showed racist white people and not black.
We just not gonna talk about the time aurthor was called a nitter
okay I know it's so off topic but I just realized that he's attracted. like hes cute, and my type. idk why it took me this long.
ms grady was a black woman and the vice principal was a white woman is what ive heard. i dont know if thats true, but they could also have been scraping the top of schools refusing to hire aids for black teachers simply because they "dont want to waste money".
Im 25%black  My dsd is black and white and my moms white.. It depends on the person but I still get called nigg3r by white ppl and cracker by certain black ppl. to certain black people I'm black.. some I'm white. That 25% kept me safe when I was in a majority black prison tho haha
Is that Danny devito in your corner
Yoooo I’ve seen you on Charles channels. I was like… hang on… I know that voice…
WNT (We Need Trump)❤️👍
Fresh prince.... they were pulled over at night. Next time you drive by a car at night tell me what color the driver is. No racial profile. The car was registered in someone else's name and they had no proof that they had been in possession of the car legally.  Carlton divulging that information was the right thing to do as had he not done so, when the plates were ran it would have been more suspicious had they not mentioned it. The outcome of the stop would have been the same regardless of race and aside from the hands on the wheel advice, Carltons approach was better than Wills. Cops ask both white and black people to keep their hands in the wheel/where they can be seen.   Mercedes has 3 models in the top 10 most stolen luxury vehicles. In the US whites make up 59.4% of Mercedes ownership as opposed to 16.6% owned by blacks. Black individuals account for 28.6% of motor vehicle thefts while making up 12.1% of the population. Whites account for 67.6% of MV thefts while making up 57.8% of the population.  That means the likelihood of a MV theft being committed by black suspects is about 2.2 times more likely than committed by whites. Stories, schemes, excuses, and denials are common for the vast majority of guilty criminals of all races. Independent of race, the manner in which Will and Carton legally and truthfully gained possession of the car is far less likely than the car being stolen.  When considering the info above it is clear that the initial encounter made by police in pulling the car over was NOT  likely influenced by race as it would have been extremely difficult to identify the race of the occupants in the conditions. The interrogation and suspension of the car being stolen even before any information is divulged by Carlton would have justified based on the statistics mentioned above.  The arrest of the occupants after the details of the vehicle ownership and the rarity of the reasons given would likely have occurred regardless of race.  In conclusion race was an issue because it was viewed through the lens of a racist person and does nothing but further propagate racial division insinuating racial bias due to hatred. Using race is the crutch of the ignorant who are either too ignorant or too lazy to apply logical analysis of fact to a situation.  Or the narrative is being used by race baiting individuals who profit from the idea of racial hatred and oppression and depend on it's existence as their source of attention and or income.
Earl had a fun night.

If You Like When Shows Get Serious, You Should Watch And Review Some Episodes Of Punky Brewster…
What the hell is standing in the back corner? Is that Danny Devito?
I’m a white kid who grew up in what is perceived as the “Ghetto” and quite literally raised by racist rednecks who thought that the color of their skin made them better than everyone else. I remember getting the shit beat out of me by kids older than me, because my parents were starting trouble and obviously they couldn’t beat up grown ass adults. Had a tent crushed while I was inside(one of those fold-up princess tents) and experienced my first panic attack as I nearly suffocated under the impact. Somehow this only fed into my parents’ views, and we eventually moved. I got over it pretty quickly as a kid and went on to have several mixed and darker toned besties, one of them is still with me to this day and I love her dearly ❤   Shows like this really do change your view on things, I remember watching Static shock with my uncles when I went to live with my grandparents, they loved that show and I grew to be quite fond of it as well. It was the gun episode that really brought me to tears tho…
Bet it was Elmo
What about the Arthur one where is goes he's a nitter
ya got me tuvington lololololol
Love the avatars
Honestly it seems like a lot of "older" cartoons and series tackle the issue of diversity and racism better than most modern shows. Static shock handled it a mature way for older kids, and Sesame Street handled it in a simple way for toddlers, teaching kids that they can be friends with others no matter what they look like. Obviously there are some more recent series that tackle this issues in a more nuanced way, and diversity in childrens media has become more wide spread, which is good, but there are definitely some HUGE misses in terms of tackling theses issues.

The That's So Raven episode about racism was the first time I learned about racism and I remember being so confused I just didn't see how the skin color of another person had to do with anything negative.
the whole thing with steven universe os so stupid because their only problem was the fact that it was 2 boys, they didnt even make it the main thing they js made them a gay couple, and the beginin of it was suppose to be satire
I remember sitting under my blankets watching the Raven episode😂most of these actually
Why does tuv’s goofy 2016 character drawing look like a homeless drug addict
Why does tuv’s goofy 2016 character drawing look like a homeless drug addict
Sorry, but racism is dying. It was dead in the 90s, but desperate politicians seeing their usefulness disappearing are trying desperately to resurrect it.
Ahh yes, That So Raven and Fresh Prince. My 2 favorite cartoons lol  In all seriousness, great content as usual, man!
thats why cartoons back in the day were funny, unlike these new cartoons that doesn't want to hurt anyones feelings.
tuv dropshiping his own company 😮
I’m surprised people hated the SU psa, i didn’t mind it but wow. ALOT OF PEOPLE HATED IT.
This is just borning bruh. The fact people keep being this to light is what helps those horrible people thrive. Just shut up and don't let it bother you and move on with your life. They're obviously more miserable than you so just smile at them
Tu v
I didn't know Raven, and Fresh Prince were cartoons!
the leafy reference gave me youtube whiplash
Nice seeing you upload more!
Kinda surprised you didn’t mention the Proud Family episode that featured a scene about racism toward Muslims. We even learn about aspects of Muslim culture, like fasting and the hijab.   It’s the few times a cartoon covers racism towards a minority group that isn’t black (I know it’s religious, but in the US, it’s heavily associated with Middle Easterners).  I know African-Americans are the largest minority group in the US, but we’re definitely not the only minorities who experience racism. Hopefully, more people of color also get representation in cartoons.
Oh yeah, I very much remember that Fresh Prince episode. It was when Carlton got his first taste of racism, and was left confused about it
How weird is it that I remember the Static Shock one, but not Arthur despite watching Arthur more?
i stg youve been blacklisted from my recommended i dont see you on it at all anymore i have to search up ur channel to check if theres anything new
The Fresh prince of bel-air story hits deep. This happens to a lot of Minorities basically every single day. Being racially profiled by the majority or important job and role model like a police officer. Carlton didn't get off easy but he neve encountered the realities of racial profiling because he lived a lavish lifestyle and always never got in trouble and thought that police officers were just "doing their jobs" when reality they were harassing them for no reason other than to suspect them of a crime. While Will knows because he lived in a community and saw that black people are constantly targeted by anyone because of their color. It takes one person from the Majority to speak out against ignorant hatred.
Static shock was such a good show
bro think he tomdark
Who's the man in the corner brah?
tuvington <3 lol was trying to find where to submit fanart
I remember the Steven Universe commercial
Really like the 90's/00's examples (showing realistic examples of racism with reasonable ways of confronting it). The Arthur one is iffy, as while it does a decent job at teaching children about civil disobedience, it wouldn't surprise me if the principal was completely oblivious to any concerns regarding racism and just had budget concerns. The Steven Universe one is also iffy, as the overwhelming majority of white supremacists are also vehemently homophobic (even if they're in the closet) and would at the very least express their distaste towards same sex marriage, if not emphasize it. Making one of the characters female would've made this a far better PSA.
I think you should do some total drama island stuff. Like a n examination of his personality and possible mental issues he has. 🤩🤩🤩
Technically 3 of what you just showed aren't cartoons. As they're not exaggerated drawings of any kind. You should've titled this kids show instead.
Random questions, to everyone who has listened to ear candy what is your favorite song? ( mine is starburst )
Great vid bro.😺
Stop that's bad ,let's be friends...... Cartoon logic 💀
Fuck racism 🖕
I need that plushie 🥺
Its funny how most of these shows arnt even cartoons.
What about that Walt Disney cartoon when there was Alice isn't that the first cartoon with Walt Disney in Dallas who was Alice the girl's name was Alice
I love being a minority, I can say whatever I want.
8:12 THATS SO RUDE!!!! I'M BLACK TOO!!!
By the way that’s so raven Sesame Street and fresh prince are not cartoons
Saw the Static Shock characters on the thumbnail of cours I had to click on it. A very good video, thank you for talking about Static ! Also, the comics had a reboot recently, it is very good so if you are interested in the show, you should definitely have a look at it !
Looks more like anti-white propaganda. I'll believe a kids show is actually tackling racism when it calls out the way Asians are treated by black youths and adults.
6:19 - 6:25
I love racism
13:59 uncle phil is a judge! Not a lawyer.
I loved the Static Shock one and Teen Titans one. Except that in the Teen Titans racism episode, when Cyborg was having a heart-to-heart with Starfire, he said he understood her because he was a "cyborg," and not because he was black.
Ey, ey, ey, ey, now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped, turned upside down, and id like to take a minute just sit right there, ill tell ya how i became the prince of a town called belair. In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground is where i spent most of my days, chillin out maxin, relaxin all cool and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood.
Cartoons back then were way better then nowadays.
Why does the thumbnail looks like a videogame boss compilation
"Kids... Don't be racist." We did it, boys! Racism is no more!
Video starts at 2:03
Man this is why I enjoy tuv, he made it big and is still helpin his friends and calling them out in a positive manner, we need more people like tuv in the YouTube space I swear
if racism gets worse i might have to step in
One of the best Uncle Phil scenes also there's a Family Matters episode that tackles the same thing.
The raven episode really did a good job. My older sister and I both loved the show.
6:24 Earl Sweatshirt
I'm more concerned about the Danny Devito taxidermy in the background.
Love the consistency!
I would change the title because I don't think That's So Raven and The Prince of Bel-Air are cartoons. Great video tho 😀👍🏿
How do you submit my fan art to you?
Tuvington
These episodes wouldn’t be able to be made these days. Conservatives would tweet about how “woke” it is, and some connection they happens to have will threaten to reduce their funding if they air it (which they’ll comply)
3:48 [Here is my Unpopular opinion] Modern rap sucks and I agree with his Dad as a graveyard shift man myself; I really do not like that psuedo wannabe cultural tread of rap.      Literally pant sagging has it roots in Slavery Era indoctrination, aka, Breaking The Buck.       Every intellectually aware Brotha an Sistah, knows the prison promoting gang culture is disrespectful and a joke.          No Matter how many times rappers try to revamp the image, it will not excuse decades of promoting societal intolerance an cultural anarchy.        There is a right an wrong way to be a activist against police brutality an other social injustices, many ways maybe flawed with good intentions.      Yet, Overall in the end, being useless.      But rap an gang culture by definition only promotes treason and debauchery; For decades they have done this, revamping their image into another abhorrent visage.         His father is right to abhor rap.            Even my father an his colleagues abhorred rap music.          It is a swallow musical genre that has had negative impacts on American society, because it directly is responsible for promoting anarchy, treason, and debauchery.     [Swirls🍷].        Anywho, I have 315lbs rows to finish.           Well, I sip my whey protein to my current university degree.   Soon I will have master's degree.        [🍷 Swirls whey cranberry juice].
7:50 I think you meant 500 word, not 500 page lol.
Bro really took a shot at leafy lmao hilarious
Serious things when raisim takes...
Very good video idea never knew static shock and Arthur had racism episodes
Just chillin on my lunch break crying bcuz static shock is lit af
bro remove the cartoon ,,avatar,, image, it has no role , its cringe, just feedback
Shows handled topics like this so much better back in the day before woke media to a hold of it. Now everything you see just seems forced for a higher esg score. I remember specifically an episode of NCIS (original) that handled a transgender topic very well which didn’t seem forced at all. It was a good episode that wasn’t ruined because they tried too hard to be woke, and to be fair it was way before Hollywood got so big into wokeness. To contrast it, I saw an episode of NCIS:LA where they tried to show racism and it was awful. They forced it too hard and made it just unbearable. This for reference was in the time of major wokeness in Hollywood (I think last year). In essence my problem isn’t with shows portraying these matters, it’s show portraying these matters in a forced way that makes them unwatchable.
that's a cool No Face tattoo, bruv
Hey tuv not to sounds rude but your little cartoon fella looks like Sam pepper 😅
As someone who is black and bi, i do like when shows explain racism and discrimination against lgbt people but i do also agree people who are WAY too progressive whether its allies or people from the lgbt community(its mainly them mostly and other groups like bIm, feminists, activists etc) can be irritating especially when it comes to pushing whatever beliefs they have onto others by force
500 page essay?!? Are u sure it’s not 500 words?
Theres a difference between understanding not to be racist and then pushing a poIitcal agenda, do not put the two together. Thats what im understanding from the steven universe dislike
Static Shock was awesome!!
Me waiting for blueryai to react
I don't think they should expose worldly problems to young children??  telling black kids that no one likes them cause of their skin, telling white kids they are a problem cause they are apparently racist cause they white
Leafys chin isn't all that bad lol
Static was an amazing show. 👏
As a white person that has always been with and lived with minorities, I feel like I don’t have white privilege, I just know that people can be racist but I disagree being a white is harder then a different color.
if we would include family guy, this video would be a lot longer..
the Steven universe psa wasn’t horrible, but I feel like most of the dislikes where from bigoted homophones not wanting gay representation, it didn’t deserve the hate it got in my opinion.
You have to approach these types of problems with a level of nuance. You can’t just say your point you have to show it, which is why the SU PSA failed & why the Fresh Prince & Static Shock episodes succeeded. A PSA doesn’t give enough time to show the problem only enough to tell you it exists while a 30 minute tv show episode can show you the problem & show why it’s a problem.
Ah,, a brand new tuv video. Always makes my day. Keep going! Loved this video concept. You never disappoint, Bertie.
The danny cardboard cutout scared me
You should talk about the censored 11 looney tunes as that is extremely racist
EVERYBODY GET UP TUV POSTED
Been itching for a new tuv video
Static Shock was so head of its time <3
Wuv drops a banger as always
BLACK PEOPLE CANT MARRY WHITE PEOPLE!
Older cartoons did it right, newer ones tho.....
That ending of The Fresh Prince episode was the moment that Carlton's innocence was shattered.  It's tough realizing that some people will always judge you because of your skin color (speaking as a minority).
What about Teen Titans? There was an episode that was named Troq. This superhero named Val-Yor arrived on Earth and he treats everyone well except for Starfire. He kept being mean to her and told her that she was nothing. The one thing that I just love about the show is that they don't play about each other. Friendship like that is so hard to find. Everyone immediately believes her. I don't know if anyone mentioned it yet, but that's an example of racism too. I thought that put that out there. Feel free to comment with your opinion below. Have a nice day❤️❤️😊
14:35 "Would you stop a car driving 2 miles per hour if you were a cop?" Yes because it is too slow.
you should make a part 2. Add teen titans !!
I hope you get a feature with playboy carti
18:24 I am a building
16:19 I feel bad because my immediate reaction to the John Lewis aardvark was “EUGH”
static shock really handled the issue with real dignity...notice how it painted mr foley as an antagonist,but not a villian...deep down he was a good person,something in his life just set him in a wrong way of thinking...and instead of agression both arthur and virgil counter it with reason and compassion.  it would have been so easy for them to just wright off mr. foley off as some unchanging irrideemable monster but they took the higher road and thats commendable.
Devolving into PNGtuber (or whatever its called) I guess
10:05 homie doesn’t know hoopers store.
Zootopia was the best piece of media to tackle racism B)
Back in the day they really got the point across in a normal human way but these days it's more worldly and doesn't get anything across at all  It's how the world is these days people get mad at each other from race to political stuff from both sides I wish people even these days sat down and talk like normal people instead of getting angry and ruining things or pushing political propaganda but instead talk about race in a normal adult way
Why is it all sad stuff?
Gr8 man this is awesome
I love these shows
I think the first Steven Universe attempt was weird because of Garnet showing up out of nowhere and just saying "Don't be racist!"   It's strangely blunt which isn't necessarily bad, especially when kids are involved, but made their addressing of a serious topic almost comical.
CAN WE APPRECIATE MONSTER HIGHS WEREWOLVES VS VAMPIRES THING BECAUSE IT WAS A RLLY GOOD WAY TO TALK ABT RACISM TO CHILDREN AND NOBODY EVER GIVES CREDIT TO MONSTER HIGH FOR HOW GOOD THEY WERE
Will Smith the best cartoon character...change my mind
dont become a pngtuber with minecraft parkour in background lol
ayo tuv, can you make a t-shirt or sweatshirt with little tuv? hes in "the earls" stuff
Arthur my favorite cartoons all of times. :-') <3
Tuv!
Funny i just watch the clip of static days ago
Even as a kid, I thought it was wild when they dropped the hard R in Static Shock
man steven universe really dropped the most dogshit thing ever, the first time i saw it i thought it was some kind of AI voice video made by some troll, truly some goofy stuff
fresh prince of bel air is my favourite anime
This all sucks and racism and racist people are trash. But the cartoon guy in Arthur is kinda spooky
Half of these examples aren’t cartoons 🙄
The negative response to the Steven Universe one clearly was about homophobia. It seems as though cartoons completely avoid involving gay people in their series. And then people try to come up with all these excuses for why it shouldn't be shown. Like if you guys got something to say about the kids being gay, then say that shit and own it, don't hide behind excuses and bs like pussies.
another memorable episode is that episode of the proud family where penny goes back
“ I got so much street cred they write my name on the signs, I’d ring you for tech support but I got a Nobel prize.”
I love the fresh Prince of Bel Air  It's always been a show I loved and a show I watch for comfort
For me the fresh prince is the best at pulling on your heart strings because it's mostly a comedy so when it does something serious it hurts lmao
You are so right
Antifa is a terrorist organization and BLM a scam also, 13/52
I don't think anyone should be 'ecstatic' about their race. It is good to know world history and the injustices of the past, but the more we associate our identity with something as unimportant as race, problems always arise.
avenue q did it best
Racism hardly exists anymore today, at least not to the degree where it was back then in America. So it shouldn’t be treated as an ongoing problem in kids cartoons… its history. What is this gonna make kids think about society and their country when they grow up?
How tf is this fascist propaganda do they not realize that what they are advacating for is literally the defintion of facism. It goes to show how arrogant they are.
Yeah that Fresh Prince episode ticked me off seeing how sheltered Carlton was. Static Shock was the best, it's was nice to see Ritchie's Dad change his views, a lot of older bigots don't change. Also is tjere someone behind you or is that. A mannequin.........
Young Justice handled racisim well with Miss Martian.  In young Justice the Martians are not extinct, and there are two types: green and white. However there is hostility on both sides, particularly the green martians towards the white ones. Meghan is a white Martian and because of it faces prejudice and ostracism on mars. It was one of the reasons she chose to leave for earth. When she arrives she takes on a green Martian form, out of fear of facing the same racisim that she experienced on mars. It’s not just insecurity, she’s absolutely terrified of the truth being revealed. Even as she makes friends and gets a boyfriend she’s even more terrified that if the truth gets out she’ll be rejected all over again. When she finally gets the courage to reveal the truth to them and shows them her true form, her friends and boyfriend support her and tell her they like her for who she is, not her species.  It shows how dealing with racisim can be traumatic but more importantly, to not be afraid to look for people in your life who will love you for who you are.
500 page essay ?!?!
1:42 You Are Genius. For Using Perfect Microfon!
Literally Earl sweatshirt
To bad Ravens future sight didn't see Corey being a weirdo
ily and i love ur videos they r so interesting
the fresh prince one was my favorite representation of how it feels. when carlton is reflecting at the end on the fact he’s gonna be profiled like that forever, it hit me really hard because when i had my first racism experience that’s how it felt. there’s no easing into the topic once u learn it’s permanent for the foreseeable future, it all just hits u at once. u can try to rationalize it like carlton did, but after the first couple times u realize nothing you could’ve done would’ve changed the treatment  you got.
5:00 personalli i would morely like an episode where a racist character finds out that for example black people can be fun and cool the same like white people
I remember as a kid my older millennial cousins claimed Arthur was "their" show "only 90's kids would understand" HAHA U WERE WRONG
I like the avatar/character that tuv includes, i usually put on his videos and play it in the background. Do what makes you comfortable tuv, love your videos man
im so happy you posted this :D Im sorry im thats all i have to say hah- uhm good vid? IDKDK ;v;''
Sesame Street people are giving the raspberry, not fart noises.
Luv u Tuv
Static shock did it best. Uncontested
Damn bro I haven't watched in a minute and the production quality is insane man, keep up the hard work you deserve all the love you're getting
Racism was tackled a lot better back in the 90s, where we show true Racism.  Not like today where Progressive activists target non racist acts as racists.  Nowadays, being labeled a racist has no meaning due to Twitter morons using it to call everybody racist for nothing.
I think Steven universe at the end of the is a good show, and the animation is gorgeous.
Arthur’s world has animals, racism can’t exist in an anthropomorphic setting unless it’s like how Zootopia handled it. Rick and Morty said it best “Imagine being a racist snake, ‘Hey, other snake, I hate you because you’re the wrong colored snake!’ OMG!”
7:06 do a off white drop "Earl" sounds pretty cool
Racism is pure evil to hate someone for how they look and the color of their skin is horrible as a native American I won't say anything corny like I've experienced racism myself but a lot of my family members have as well I could never understand the hate for someone just because of the color they were born I have so many mixed races in my family and I couldn't imagine hating them for that reason I believe these cartoons especially static shock handled it very well
I still watch Sesame Street tho
u pretty mf use earl instead idk
I hate the far right saying that "hey, treat all people with basic human decency" is 'fascist propoganda.' We need actual fascists and communists running for office so that they can really see what it actually looks like.
Ayo the black dudes dad's voice actor is the same dude from telltale walking dead sn 1 im pretty sure from listening
If I had to make a wild guess why shows and videos tackling racism nowadays get harsh feedback well..it's likely just the time period honestly. Back in the 90s and early 2000s you either heard no one talk about racism or a small amount of shows brought it up, but now in modern times it's everywhere, to the point people either feel annoyed by it or it's become oversaturated.  But that's just my guess.
now if only people could tell the difference between actual racism and people not liking how often characters have been getting race-swapped in things lately.
the steven psa was weak. but at least it has good intention ig
You missed out on some solid examples that show the complexity of racial issues. In a later Fresh Prince season, we also get a perfect example of how racism affects the culture of the targeted group. They're attempting to join a black fraternity and immediately push Carlton out because he's "too white" therefore doesn't understand their experience. That's something not enough people talk about, that's something I've experienced firsthand, the racism that can occur within groups of.
👏👏👏👏👏
There was an episode from the Super Mario bros 3 cartoon were the toads and the Mario bros were painted red and blue and I think they talked about racism too
earl merch has the ellen font
Great cover on all of these shows. I'm new to your channel and I think I'll be tuning into more. You have a very clear voice and are very articulate and know what you're talking about. I really miss these shows that I grew up watching including Arthur and Fresh Prince. I learned the most from those shows. 💯
tuv rantsona real
i kept thinking that cardboard cutout in the back was a real person
wait ... wait wait wait... wait... wait.... wait... is that a live-sized Danny DeVito behind you? where can i get one???
No proud family?
Um no honey ain’t nobody racist, it’s your attitude that people don’t like.
Racism is bad ~Vergil
I don't think we should be making kids believe that they live in a country where black people are oppressed
I dont rly think u read shit from ur fans but uhhhh I wasn't planning on listening to ear candy but it was dece, but Tommy Lee is a straight certified hood classic. It's got that phonk perfection, u should keep running that man. Hyperpop Phonk, but maybe more hard and wavy? Idk, I had no clue I'd love your shit. If you ever need any production advice I'm ur guy. I know ableton to the core.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was the mainstay of my primetime viewing during my teen years (basically 2007-2013).  Not only did I find it extremely funny, but the moments where they tackle serious issues hit differently than other 90s era shows; probably because Fresh Prince did these serious moments more often, and managed to break the tension with well-placed moments of comedy.  They never felt like "a very special episode" kind of thing.   And for a dumb white girl like me, a lot of these moments shaped much of my understanding of race related topics.  Carlton is so used to the privlieges wealth has given him---all the people he's hung around have been other wealthy individuals, from his family's friends/associates to his peers at school, majority of whom are white---that this situation is such a harsh reality check for him.  Like Will says in the ep, in the real world, none of his status or achievements matter when the first thing anyone sees is his race.  In fact, a much later episode touches on the dichotomy between his wealth and race. Carlton's not allowed into a club at his and Will's college because the other black members tell him he's "not really black"; that because he comes from wealth he can't understand the "true experience" of other black men.  It really is a great series.  Also, fun fact: Will got to name his character, and he was advised by Carlton's actor, Alfonso Riberio, that whatever name he picks for his character is what everyone's gonna call him for the rest of his career (which, considering Alfonso is still called "Carlton" to this day, he was right in that regard).
You know it's sad that humanity still hasn't gotten rid of "race" when we're all the same race which is human while skin color is just the result of the environment our respective ancestors lived.
Change the thumbnail, I thought it was an add😭
18:56 this is so silly LOL because the PSA has nothing to do about them being gay, some people are just... gay.
Am glad I found your channel tuv your so amazing
Babe wake up, TUV posted. On a streak too
You forgot the squirell jokes episode of spongebob
Gonna be honest raven's home did it better than the original show
Bro I've watched almost all of these and I remember the Raven episode so well. That really introduced me to what racism was/meant and as a kid it was confusing. Why would I discriminate against other people just because of their skin color? I also watched the Fresh Prince one as I was older and appreciated the way they went with the story. It was funny but also just so realistic (unfortunately).
i love episodes like the fresh prince and that’s so raven and how they show a better perspective into racism as it affects systems we have set up today (like being profiled or applying for jobs) because racism isn’t just how someone treats another person but also how our entire system is built around prejudices that just don’t make sense. It’s an honest and real approach that does an amazing job at showing everyone what it’s like being a minority (having to go through more than just hate in life) and I wish there were more portrayals like that
Static Shock seems so damn cool, such a shame I've never discovered it as a kid
Interesting video.  You may want to change the title: That's So Raven, Fresh Prince, and Sesame Street aren't cartoons.
Anyone not gonna mention that's Tuvs avatar looks like a ghetto Bachira from blue lock
static shock reminds me of my best friend's family. they're all christian southern whites, and have terrible values. i'm indian, but to them, not the "gas station/liqour store types." instead my family is an "educated christian" family (my mom is a doctor, dad an engineer). her family has in fact crossed the street whenever there were black people, called india dirty and poor when my bsf asked to come visit. "there is no difference between india and a dumpster." I feel so bad for her as well cause she is incredibly disconnected from them. half the time she tells me about how her family doesn't actually know what she likes, and how she rarely has deep convos with them. it sucks that she doesn't feel connected to her *own* family cause theyre all prejudiced little shits. im pretty sure her distant relatives also think im white cause i have a Hebrew name.
Nah that intro art crazy
Fresh prince was the shit
ur mic sounds way better away from ur face, i dont know why ppl think they need to be an inch away from their mic like its a cheap 10$ one
Tuvvy Tom
make a part 2 and add in south park
Nah cartoons are against me now
I definitely think it’s important to show the mistreatment of other minorities. But it’s also important to not paint every white person as racist or hateful towards these minorities. every human should be treated with respect ❤
There's a better racism episode of Steven Universe. I forgot the title but the premise is Peridot thinking Pearl can't help bc she's just a pearl. Then they spend the time having a robot battle ep. I like that both robots have strength and weaknesses. Peridot wins but the gems just go to Pearl. I really like that part bc while we never saw it, it did look like Peridot realized that she was wrong when no one supports her. Bc if Pearl was just op and won, it would just look like Peridot respects her bc she won rather than bc she has a point. And also like that Pearl wasn't too weak. Her robot had great skills and was a challenge for Peridot.
Tbh your cartoon version kinda reminds me of Turkey Tom. Same artist?
I love when tuv takes a break from unsettling and creepy shit and talks about wholesome content. Keep up the good work.
Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air also had a gun control episode that was really sad too. Alongside the subject of a Dad who wasn't there for his kid, that is probably the most popular out of the two.   The show was really sad and joyful at the same time. Was a great show and always will be.  RIP. James Avery.
Good video, however, your title says racism in cartoons however Fresh Prince is not a cartoon? Lil confused there
I think the reason why people hated that steven universe psa was because honestly... it was kinda just dumb lmfao. Even sesame street, which is made for toddlers, was more in depth with its message. All the steven universe psa had was one of the main characters saying "dont be racist", like yeah, no shit. Just felt pretty tone deaf and almost insulting. Something like static shock or fresh prince handled the topic way better and in a far more educational way imo. Dont just tell kids racism is bad, SHOW them why its bad.
Shows targeted towards kids should never cover topics such as racism or identity politics. It's the PARENTS' job to teach kids about stuff like that, not the TV shows. Kids' shows need to stop trying to take parenting into their own hands and trying to teach our children stuff they don't need to know at the age they're at
I grew up on fresh prince (im 43 now, i know im old). Fresh prince is one of the best shows ever. Easily gonna make you cry..laugh out loud...piss you off and make you think.
Is it just me, or does Mr folie or whatever look like Mr incredible?
Only good thing That’s So Raven ever did was create Cory In Da House.
Writing racism in fictional settings can be a hard task to execute, especially when people have a negative perception on morals being discussed on discrimination. It one way, it can work to its advantage like Static Shock, or fail to hit the mark like Zootopia. Although the Steven universe's first PSA on racism could've been better handled, Just A Robot is the LAST person to be taking advice on this matter, who's been racist himself and said racial allegories don't work, ironically enough. Though even when it's done well, people just don't like the idea of racism being taught, either because they feel called out or it makes them feel uncomfortable, which is all the more reason why it should be explored more anyway. I mean we have people losing their shit over April O'Neil being black in the new TMNT movie, and that's just one example of the ridiculous racial backlash that comes out of entertainment that has races of characters or stories that aren't normally featured. The more these types of stories are shown the better.   (Side note) So it seems that JAR has managed to apologize for his racist activity in the past, and although that's a start, I'm still rather skeptical of his online presence when talking about specific topics and people.
1:06 Why does this kinda looks like turkey tom’s character
All of these were great, and then there’s Steven universe 💀
a kiss for tuv for making videos lot often 😘
Video idea!!!! Since you like anime, you can do gruesome anime/manga cuz there’s a lot and i thought it was a good idea, and i love your vids tuv pls continue the good content!!❤
17:12 I like how the racist kid with the blue coat only cares about the fact that they're different races and not that they're the same gender
THIS VIDEO IS SO GOOD. MORE PLS. not everything has to be about disturbing things, this is an amazing retrospective
Also, this is a good counter-example to people saying "Keep politics out of media. Stop being woke. In the past there were no politics in media so things were fun to watch." These episodes were EXPLICITLY addressing political issues, specifically racism.
wearable hoodie, this man is a genius. no dislikes on his video either. absolute legend
As an adult, I can appreciate how Fresh Prince addressed certain topics on a poignant note (for it's time). Like this one and Will's dad. I was a little young, watching it by myself it definitely flew over my head at the time.
Wow. I remember Static Shock being entertaining and fun to watch as a kid, but I never thought about the social issues being depicted in the show. Very nice.
Sometimes, you gotta find a balance between critiquing stuff that's too diverse and bringing to light the issues within said communities. Steven Universe initially failed in both aspects.
Basically everyone is supportive when racism is towards black people but when lgbtq racism is on screen it’s too much for kids give me a fking break
I LOVE YOU TUV
The Arthur one just didn't make sense to me. What if the principal was just stubborn and just purely thought that she really didn't need more help?
My brother and I just finished the first season of Static Shock recently, Sons of the Fathers is such a powerful episode. The writing is perfect. The best part is that after the father changed his ways, they didn't hold it against him. Being able to forgive shows maturity.
i havent watched bro for a lil bit and this mf comes out with a song featuring funeral
As a long time fan of Steven Universe, catching it before season two aired, I can say how much I hated that first PSA and another one that featured Amethyst.   Both of these PSA were so on the nose and quite pushy with their subject matter. Think back to those Drug PSA’s. Not all of them, but many of them were quite short yet left an impact because they used a more adult tone. These ones were jam packed, super idealized and unrealistic and tore down one argument for being overt while literally being overt with theirs in the process.  And the show proper was not represented well. Because the show had much more nuance, showed characters who were flawed but capable of change and they also showed more adult themes without being so overt. It was just a far departure from what was created before and honestly did feel like propagandizing for sure.
Hey, Tuv! I think you should put more stands in your character because it will be more fun! And I mean, like: when you're talking, the character just stands and nothing else, so I thought maybe that you could put the character with its arms up, angry, or just more arms in general.
I LOVE THE LITTLE CHARCTER YOU MADE ITS COOL AF IT LOOKS GREAT BTW
hating the steven universe PSA because "the kids being gay is too distracting" is bullshit
From a non american point of view, (an actual Latin american who was born and grew up in LATAM) I think most of these shows tackle it really well, specially the old ones because, in that point those issues were prevalent.  Now, the modern ones is just not tackling "real issues" those are just issues of the past really, that two or three rotten apples exist? Yeah it sucks but, seriously most of these PSA is just being racist towards white people and telling them that they are privileged. The little girl with the "BLM" sign was not wholesome it was just weird af. Some sort of cult like. I'm not sure if its an american thing to be this ignorant but, C'mon man I would have understand if it was 2020 because, everyone was doing it but today? Why don't we talk about the racism that white people face nowadays? That's the important thing.
no one cares bro most normal people don't think of race at all. and racist jokes are funny if there not hurtful I can laugh at my own race and others. crazy how a generation of kids that grew up on south park are sensitive pussies now lol.
Tuv is the best!
I just want to add, in a past episode Mrs. Macgrady was a cancer patient. The principal really was making one elder woman with cancer cook breakfast and lunch for hundreds of kids,
The backhanded leafy roast killed me LMAO
please for the love of god dont give air to the idea of "you cant talk about racism if lgbt is involved" its literally just thinly veiled homophobia
lets appreciate that Tuv watched all these episodes just to ake this video
I’m always happy to see you post tuv🫶🏻
for Arther, what happened to the old Principle
Hey tuv i love your new character it looks so cool
you gotta do a part two of this man
nooo tuv don't become a marketable png tuber!!!!
The topic needs to be addressed carefully. Racism is bad, but it hasn't been a systemic problem since the civil rights movement in the US. To blame "the system", or worse, all white people for it is false and actually racist itself. Racism can infect an individual or a group, but it's not a problem for the government as a whole or the police as a whole. The fault with being racist lies with the individuals who are racist, not the entire country or the race of the racist individual.
Bro, I don’t think I’ve ever commented on a video and I’ve been using YouTube since the start! My point is to let you know that I just realised it’s tuv when you introduced yourself and wanted to mention that you sound a lot better than in the video where you discussed your recent visit to ‘rock bottom” and that’s awesome! I hope you are better and I dunno what it was that made me wanna let you know but something did. Stay true to yourself bro and thank you for all the videos 😊
kind of funny how in the past you had to hide a camera to catch people being racist, now they see a cellphone pointed at them and go off on a rascist rant and/or act like they are the victim of racisim.
tuv. listen. hear me out.   you're beautiful, brodi. thats why we wanna see ur face.  also happy early birthday :)
When it comes to Racism, Rebecca Sugar is a hypocrite cause she drew a racist caricature as a "rough draft" character as she puts it. Why she had to do that in first place, I don't know.
The sitcom Leave it to Beaver has an episode where the titular character befriends a little Spanish speaking boy named Chuey. Even though the two kids don't understand each other, they got along so well.   That is until the friend of Beaver's older brother named Eddie taught Beaver Spanish insults and tricks him into thinking they are compliments. It resulted in Chuey's feeling get hurt.  Beaver's parents got involved and tried to get to the bottom of it but it resulted in Chuey's parents feeling insulted. It's not until Beaver's brother explained how it happened. So the dad takes out his old high school Spanish textbook to refresh his memory and uses it to explain to Chuey's parents about the misunderstanding.  Keep in mind that this was aired 1958 during a time when racism was rife.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO POST WELLCOME BACK!!!
Bros making his plushies through sweatshops in china Tsk Tsk Tsk
So black sitcoms and puppets are cartoons?
The Steven universe psa that I just found out about from this vid as soon as it started the first thing that I though why are they showing kids tryna marry each other specially to boys what happen to just playing in the park like and running around till you fall asleep as soon as you get home😂
But its considered joking when talking shit about whites
The one I weirdly related to the most was the Sesame Street one since sometimes when me a Mexican kid was hanging out with other kids that are white, an adult would approach us and they wild usually treat the white kids better and give them more attention in middle schools the adults where teachers so yeah they kinda just ignored me like completely like I didn’t even exist and I also saw it happen to other latino and black kids
Isn’t there a episode of Arthur where Arthur learns stereotypes about Turkey other Middle Eastern country? Or was I daydreaming while staring at wall thinking I was watching Arthur.
bro I'm so used to you talking about bad and horrible sh*t it made me confused the all video as i was searching for the bad stuff where there were none. Anyway great video, cheers
bro these videos are so well put together i had when they end lol
Am I the only one who doesn't know what Sesame Street is? Why is there no introduction for it
Static Shock was taken from us too soon.
Omg the editing is so FIRE ONG
cartoon of you is so cute!!!!
this got randomly recommended to me on Discord (Someone shared it in a public channel)  but i wanted to watch the full video before i chose to sub or not I enjoyed so heres a like and a sub
It’s great that Sesame Street tackles down racism, especially since it’s beginning target audience was for latino and black children (whose parents were out working), hence the diversity it contained
As much as I like your cartoon, I feel like when you use your face, it adds a lot of uniqueness and personality to your videos, whereas the cartoon we don't get to see that/have that personal connection. And a lot of creators use cartoons to narrative their videos, which is great, but we know you as tuv and we love to see your personality through your videos :) But the choice is all yours and do what makes you comfortable! Thank you for all the amazing videos <3
My criticism of the initial Steven Universe PSA is that it doesn’t actually feel like it’s taking it seriously and is way too blunt “Kids, don’t be racist” then no explanation and then a kid somehow hired on this psa thinking it’s fake doesn’t feel like a real scenario lol.
I liked these episodes.
Ily but the simple collection is giving live laugh love/ t.j max simple design they have on everything like uh I don’t have an example but if ykyk
tuv channel is dying very fast dam
21 can you do sum famayyy
🎵Black people can't marry white people 🎵
Yay for once not a incredibly dark murder case😊
It always disappointed me how people always took the SU one out of context and would criticize it for being unrealistic, cutting out the ending part revealing that they were actors. Like I've seen so many reuploads with that part cut. That was literally the whole point, that yes, it is unrealistic and people usually don't say things like "black people can't marry white people" so bluntly. Usually. Or if they do it'll usually come with some extra rant about Jesus or whatever to pad it out.
am I crazy or are half of these shows not cartoons?? lmao
The Steven Universe BLM PSA wasn't bad at all  The PSA was not an episode, the boy apologizing quickly doesn't take away at all, be can't spend 25 minutes learning.  And the 2 boys being gay doesn't take away from anything, because SURPRISE SURPRISE black people can be gay too.  Those complaints were lame and largely from people with a shadowed bigoted background
Danny Devito watches and judges you for your sins
3:47 boom, king of the hill dining room
Bruh i can still hear the show audio in the that so raven part of the video don’t know if you did intentionally or not just trying to look out for ya
Hey tuv . Question ? Was there a party going on in your house around 10 minutes in . I’m in Aruba so I heard like music bumping with my headphones in and I jumped out of my bed to see if there was a party lol then I played it back and I heard some party music in the back
Many of these episodes really reflect how minorities, even those born in the USA will always e treated like minorities or hat they don't belong there. It's different than going to another country being a foreigner.
This video is boring and gay
That "fart" sound is called a raspberry.
Smart idea he didn’t post this in febuary
I think sexual things cartoons or children shows either alluded too or straight out said would be pretty interesting. Alot of shows used to say tons of outta pocket things
The episode from Thats So Raven was actually awful, HOWEVER it was awful in the funny goofy, endearing way that is nice comfy & enjoyable so I let it pass everytime  Also it's a reaction meme gold mine 😭
south park: "[randy marsh on wheel of fortune]"
I like how his character looks likes turkey tom
Mental heath Captain Planet can’t timber what episodes
You should do a video on autism portrayed in cartoons. I think that would be an interesting video.
THAT EPISODE OF THATS SO RAVEN SLAPPED
I’ve always been worried about racism because of how my dad was treated. He was adopted from South Korea and has told me stories of getting bullied for looking different, and I always have it in the back of my mind. But luckily in the age I’ve grown up in (he was born in the late 70s and I was born in 2010) I haven’t had to deal with racism, for what I can remember at least. Everyone born in the late 2000s early 2010s is so lucky that we didn’t have to deal with racism (too much at least), and I’m glad that people like MLK Jr. helped people realize that racism is and always will be a problem in our world.
Hey tuv, no pressure friend! I like your face but the little character is a great rendition and I'm here either way! ❤️
I can't blame people for saying the Steven Universe fandom has become cringe-worthy. That show is pretty much one of those products that's beloved by many but has a genuinely horrible fandom (Star Wars is another example but I encourage you NOT to dig into that clusterf**** in a future video cause...eugh). Like you, I also didn't care if that PSA was good or bad. Its a PSA, its just doing what its doing. But the reactions....really didn't help. I'mma be serious here, but even if they were "trying too hard", they still would've probably been bashed around. At this point, you literally can't talk about ANY real-world issue without some people screaming "WOKEISM MUST DIE" and then spouting tons of threats towards you or anyone cause apparently we're in a society hosting some twisted contest seeing who is mentally unstable enough to actually carry out that threat. All of the other shows that you talked about probably would've also suffered from what I just said if they came out today, and I'm not exaggerating. You could show all of those clips right now and they'd post like 10 videos just completely harassing everyone who made those and how they should get their jobs deleted or something. I know I'm sounding cynical but can you blame me????? Our society shouldn't be like this but yet it is, and the reactions to that PSA pretty much show how I feel right now. Sorry for rambling but I really had to get this out of my system.
Fun fact! people dont like gay/racist things being forced onto there kids
as an arthur fan, i do agree with your idea with how the principal being “white” and miss macgrady being “dark”. i already don’t like that principal character after she replaced mr. haney, but that episode can be very.. yeah because of that fact. i feel like she only did it because john lewis came to the school in the first place. i think the fact they still try to make the principal still in the right is just. eh. but its a kids show, so i can’t complain much
I’m here since 2021 and after 2 months I’m finally seeing one of your videos they really improved in just 2 months!
W video, love you dad
How cartoons handled racism Nothing, be racist
The Steven U one just had no subtlety.  It was so clear with its message any idiot could understand it.  The racists cant target their hate effectively unless we hold the target up and wave it around lol.  But thats why it failed as a psa, it made progression seem dumb.
Damm tuv got that sunnyV2 production
Tuv's little character kinda reminds me of turkey tom, great video btw
I'm old but I remember Mr.rodgers and sesame street. Oh and reading rainbow. Those aren't cartoons though. X-Men was my favorite cartoon growing up though. Stan Lee said that was the main thing he was trying to teach when he came up with X-Men was tolerance
FUNERAL HYPE
a reminder blackness cannot be stripped from someone.
Uncle Phil from fresh prince is a JUDGE! Lol I am this old.
I like the little character 🥺
The Steven universe one just feels forced and cringe worthy
I remember the episode of Smart Guy where they had a child predator and discussed what to do if you felt uncomfortable with a grownup
i always regret looking at the comment section
I grew up watching reruns of fresh prince on nick at night but I don’t remember seeing that episode
Wait Foley didn't know Virgil was black? How many white Virgil's are there in the world 😂
yeah arthur unfortunately has an issue with guess stars looking way too realistic lmao
Fresh prince was an amazing show. The episode when will ask his uncle why his dad doesn’t want him fucked me up when I was a kid. Made break down because my dad wasn’t there I always wondered the same.
WE LOVE YOU TUV!❤❤
You forgot to mention that Power Rangers Timeforce addressed some racism
I share a birthday with John Lewis which is pretty cool
19:10 less likes too
19:05 are you stupid? forcing politics onto kids shows is always poorly reviewed
18:30 yeah, to white people
And the funniest thing is, that all of this, because some people have more melanin in their skin than others.
18:20 then fallschirmjager plays
18:07 she?
17:45 they almost made someone kill themselves for drawing someone too skinny
17:30 not "lgbt friendly" more like "lgbt pandering"
The That’s So Raven episode is one of my favorite child/teen entertainment episodes of all time. I watched that episode as a young (white) Latino child, and that was the first time I actually saw racism and it really left a lasting impact on me and it taught me a lot about the world and how some people can be so hateful towards others skin color.
how is it racism if they listen to john lewis
16:20 nah blacks have big lips
16:10 bad show
14:50 south african whites discriminated
i have been staring at your cartoon character with no emotion everytime it pops up.
doubt they saw they were black
I like to race. Im a racist
14:29 maybe
13:45 they aren't real people
13:40 how
13:07 or, blacks are more likely to be criminals
Why is there a man in the background
Man, he really skimmed over the proud family. That attempt was a hot mess.
huh, that episode of Arthur is weirdly similar to the situation I was in at my previous job. I can't prove that it was due to my boss's possible racism, but I did protest by quitting lol
We must have different definitions of “cartoons.”
tf is a old bald dude in the corner for
I live in NY and there is literally no anti black racism here. None whatsoever. The only people who complain about it are the super white people.
I never understood racist mindsets you physically can’t prevent you race and most races have there perks while Asian and white people tend ro be smarter black people are always tend to be stronger and faster but at the end of the day all humans and all animals have on goal and that’s to reproduce
whos earl
The editing is insane keep it up
love that intro bro
The cartoon Horseland (about a group of friends and their pets who live at a ranch) had an ep where the ranch is having a nationality themed parade. A Native American girl comes along and becomes a main character. The mean girls want to impress the new girl by wearing her traditional clothes. Problem is that they make them short, dye them pink and blue, and add glitter, which insults the new girl
Nice! And damn you got a song with funeral now? I’ll check it out. Love you tuv
Why is the cartoon you so much... more pale?
tuv you look so easy to draw omg
The Steven universe Creator is racist Sadly. You should see what they drew in the art book
11:41 how can you see the dislikes?
Who is behind BRO TURN AROUND
The Static Shock episode was very well written, Virgil never assumes that Richie's dad is a racist at first, he takes alot of his sour attitude as just that, he explains that his dad doesnt like that music either and doesnt just assume the worst from Richie's father until he hears him explicitly say what he says, seemed like a small thing but i think the message was "dont just assume someone is racist just because they dont like what you like" it draws a real line between people just not connecting and real problem behavior. This contrast with Virgil's father who has every reason to be upset with Richie's dad but still puts that aside because he genuinely cares for Richie and doesnt hold anything against him showing his strong moral character.
love your content keep it up
can you talk about more morbid/iceberg it was so so so informational but keep up the good work and have a good day man
6:40 wow I don’t hear conkers bad fur day music often!
Cartoons that turned out to not be for kids
I've seen the Fresh Prince episode before and after listening to you explain it again I don't think the episode is exactly perfect. It's true that certain cops are racist but I certainly don't agree with the message that all cops are racist or the message that all black people have harder lives than white people some do and some don't. I definitely agree however that That's So Raven & Static Shock handled the racism issues perfectly. The Proud Family (the original not the reboot) & Teen Titans also had really good episodes handling racism that aren't hypocritical or over the top.
the rabbids blue vs white shows racism
Your use of the character reminds me of a bunch of other cartoon reviewers I watch
Yea
you should definitely do a deep dive on adult swim forgotten cartoons, there's probably so many people just don't remember, also lots of lost media from the OG adult swim days
I really appreciate this vid Tuv aka GOAT🐐
love that he's using conker's bad fur day music for his ad XD
I feel like a lot of people disliked the "Steven Universe PSA" because it felt forced and made them cringe, but that was exactly the point. The short is making fun of that retro psa that your teacher would show you at school, while being just as innocent. It's really cute in my opinion.  (But if they genuinely disliked it because of two queer kids, maybe the problem it's just them 🤡)
Don't you mean. Racism Approached on cartoons. And tv shows?
z----aaaaam
are i’m tripping or “that’s so raven” not cartoon
1:48 lmaoooo
I actually like the cartoon character
Fresh prince isn't a cartoon thoo
Why are there so many 2000s shows talking about racism likes we still live in Jim Crow era?💀
Holy shit the leafy call out tho.  I guess I wouldn't mind if you used the PNG character if it had more emotions and faces and wasn't so static.
I loved this! Thank you Tuv ♥️
The fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode is something that I still watch.
The only thing I picked up from Steven Universe PSA was the sing-songy "Black People Can't Marry White People" stuck in my head
15:25 “The show takes place in the fictional city of Ellwood.” Tuv knows that’s a real city right? I live in the city😂
Let's be real racism in kids shows was handled much better back in the 90s and 2000s than it is now.
That Static Shock episode is how I found out my parents are racist. They still say sht like that to this day.
i dont like your cartoon guy thingy
Who made the cartoon for Tuv? You committed a crime we all have to pay for now 😢
hi tuv
Go woke go broke
the episode from thats so raven is similar to s5 e18 of sister sister
Hey tuv whare did you get that alien light ?
" My bigotry is distracting me from being raciest. Thanks Steven Universe! "
there's this tiktoker that looks like you and probably stealing your ideas
song with disturbing backstories part 3 ?????
Barely any of these were cartoons 😂
I am commenting on this now because I know for a fact in the future this will blow up…..HELLO PAST PEOPLE : D
As a felow racist i find most of these relatible
Bro was sleeping with earl🤔
moments in the show where ravens just like this at 8:11 are just so ..... idk how to describe it really but kinda funny in a sense...
Rebooted proud family fucked up on their episodes with some racial material like their "slaves build this country" and the one sided history about Abraham Lincoln not wanting to help slaves. even going as far as to bring up protest about their town founding father having a history of owning slaves and demanding the statue be torn down, including the interracial gay fathers where the black man yells at his white partner to use his white privilege to stop the riot officers from arresting their adopted daughters. it's that kind of bullshit where it divided the races within the nation.   also to add to what rebooted proud family did was when a black guy named noah dated zoey, who if some don't know is the only white girl in the group of friends, but only dated her because he was interested in white girls only. they made it seem like not only is it bad for a black man to have his interest in dating only white girls a bad thing, but that it wrong for blacks to romanticize with whites.  to put it simple. its woke and its horrible. yes this is part of the real world but instead of uniting races like how proud family did it in the past, they did a complete 180 for the woke and did a hate on the whites episode. but thats what happens when you have a director who literally exposed herself and said that this is part of her not-so-secret gay/woke agenda.
Ok, I can deal with 50/50 by the way thank you for listening, it's hard for me to be on camera also I get it, although I only have like 140 subs so it's much less pressure 🤣🤣🤣
✊️🙌👏👏👏
How awesome would it have been if it turned out that Raven wasn't racist but ignorant and her vision was brought about by her perception of white people? I think that would've made for a longer lasting impression.
I’ve been here scene around 100k subs and you have always stayed kind and thoughtful and I just wanted to say thank you for never changing or becoming greedy
You do extremely well on camera I feel like I could never, been wanting to try at least
Probably not the best ad read transition
Not what I expected but I'm here for static shock
WAIT NO I LIKE THE CHARACTER
The ONLY issue really for me with the cartoon, was that hit didn't move or actually have a moving mouth.  If it was animated to move and such ,I don't mind watching it :)
I think the family matters episode should have been shown but otherwise great video
Some of my favorite Fresh Prince moments came when they got serious. Uncle Phil was an actual influence. His character was wise and passed it down to the audience while we watched his boys get into trouble. One of my favorite shows of all time. RIP James Avery
Tuv farted at 4:32
This video is a slap like a hit like you k own when you someone that's like it you know?
The Fresh Prince episode was one of the first times child me realized just how prolific racism was. I'll never forget that feeling.
the pngtuber thing is super cringe, saberspark furry looking aaaaahhhh
Steven Universe is so bad at it and people who think they good at it, either your education background is sucks or your IQ is low from the start
I'm going to say something controversial here: I believe that racism shouldn't be tackled by kids' programming since it's the fault of race hustlers that this agenda is being put in the first place. I'm not racist or anything I'm just saying that an agenda like this shouldn't be put there since the levels of white guilt and misinformation about this topic have skyrocketed since critical race theory plus the woke agenda has invaded our culture and caused a lot of monetary and sadly sometimes human losses. Take BLM for example, George Floyd's death was just an example of the wrong place, at the wrong time, and woke activists took this way too far by looting in the streets of America. It was truly a dark moment in American history and has shown how bad CRT has been to our culture. Overall this has been my statement about this subject and I hope to not offend anyone with this comment.
You pulled up my favorite adventure time episode in the begining
King of the hill is prolly the best racism episode ever made. Hank and his family meet ppl from laos(which look chinese) and so they think they are chinese and THEY are the racists. Its amazing because for once the PROTAGONIST is the Racist one, and they dont even mean to harm them, theyre just uninformed😂
I feel like kids shows teaching about racism is very important. Kids do need to learn that discrimination and hate is a horrible thing and we do need to learn more.
There's no 50/50 noone wants to see the character...
IM SO HAPPY TO SE STATIC SHOCK INCLUDED OML
Danny devito lurks in the corner silently planning
7:51 500 PAGES?!
You know what gets me? That the bully in the last clip didn't care about two guys getting married but rather their skin colour. So he's racist but not homophobic? It's just a little....off. Like, I initially thought this was about homophobia, not racism.   Anyone else get that feeling?
Your png doodle of yourself lookin like turky tom.
Ur the best tuv
Had garbage from these but I don't pay to win
i think it’s great to bring real life issues into cartoons. for a lot of little kids, experience racism at a VERY young age. its great for children to understand and comprehend it.
Is that a cardboard cutout of Danny?
with Static shock, that was greatly down and shows that it can be broken in a family but a lot of it will come from the family.
tuv really thinks he can hide all that drip in the back
I don’t think very young kids should be shown problems like this. Kids should grow up learning, and I think these problems would stress kids out. Let them stay happy.
Yo the lil picture thing is wack. Ngl.
Doesn’t that so raven have a sequel called ravens home
Yuh you have grown so much now, we are so proud! Your music’s pippin the channels growing and you’ve got that avatar now. Things are changing for the better and I’m so glad to be a part of it.
Me and Earl are just "hanging out" right now. 😂 This is the best merch promotion ever. Also, OG tv shows seem to vibe so well. Old shows seem to be really well at teaching people things in a very basic straight to the point way. I miss old shows.
You can actually wear the hoodies???
Great vid and I also probably am a little late but your song cold is fire! 🔥
Bro I just ain't trynna see that in my cartoons.... I watch cartoons to escape this shit.. But now days errbody woke as fuck and wanna push their message... That's not how you combat racism
Wassgood tuv
Life is strange true colors
Why is fresh prince bel air is there? It's not a cartoon
fresh prince and that’s so raven are my favorite cartoons frfr (i’m jk ily tuv)
pngtuber lookin ahh
Seeing the "That's So Raven" racist boss episode as a kid was intense. Being reminded of it as an adult is intense all over again because the boss was so much of a racist that she didn't even tell Raven herself that she didn't get the job. The layers!
I still will never understand why some people are racist everyone is equal
Gg Tuv love u stay blessed
i remember watching the sesame street episode when i was 5 (it was a few years after the episode aired) it was in the late 90s and i loved the song baby bear sang, that i sang it the rest of that week
May John Lewis rest in peace.
Tuv can you do research about the false claims about Kwite. He didn’t deserve any of this ❤
I love the little character and you! I love seeing the mixture of both of you. The character poses you added kinda give a few different vibes to when "they" present. It's awesome to see both though!
Yo tuv ur eyes were red the whole video u alright?
Haven’t been a fan for very long, prob less than a year, but I’m happy to see your production getting better and better! Great work keep it up!
I wish I didn’t watch Arthur
When I saw that Steven Universe one, only two words came to mind: "gay agenda." I know I sound like a little Ben Shapero, but, like, I don't think kids at their age, regardless of sexuality should think of marriage, making the "let's get married" line feel very forced. Rather than being about the serious topic of racism, it feels as if it's primary trying to target normalization of homosexual marriage. It comes off as propagandistic rather than informative. It doesn't help that its primary message is "black people can't marry white people", which is over the top ridiculous because there is literally nothing preventing a white person from marrying a white person, unlike two males marrying, which is relatively new. Honestly, if this teaches anyone anything, it should be that Cartoon Network is okay with propagandizing children with whatever they feel necessary, and they really don't have good quality control.
love u tuv ur so entertaining i watch all ur vids!!!1!11! keep up the good work❤
Will gave Carlton "the talk." Thirty+ years later Black parents still have to give their kids the talk, and many still die. I remember that episode. The Rodney King beating and L.A. riots happened in '91 and '92 respectively, after this episode had been aired for a year or more.
I hate racism we should be more kind to eachother  🤠🤜🤛🏾🐵
Waiting for a cartoon to tackle issues indigenous Canadians have to deal with
11:42 the most probable cause for why it has so much dislikes is probably bc a lot of people see a show talk abt serious real world issues (such as racism) and assume it’s pandering to “woke propaganda” as stupid as that sounds
7:27 I wish I could.
loll youre now my favourite commentary ytber and youre now part of my weekly routine while eating breakfast
As someone who enjoyed Steven Universe during childhood, I was really not expecting this 💀
Not to be mean but why does Tuv’s  animated character look like bachira from blue lock lol
I LOVE TO LITTLE  U IN THE VIDS BRO
Looking back at Sesame Street they had a lot of bugs the toys the episodes the racism the puppets
*im in jail* have fun in yayle
It's amazing to see how much you have grown I remember watching you when you had 30k subscribers keep up the amazing work you have made me laugh during hard times keep going strong bro
Bro that conker music made me feel at home. Thx
This is my first time working in the food industry restaurant wise, my second job, so then what happens I’ve heard some people tell me “Hola for dos” or “Gracias” some assuming I only speak Spanish, or some other language. I am half Filipino half Mexican, and of course I get mistaken for quiet a different race such as Hindu, but for people to assume only I speak Spanish hurts. Yet I even tell them as they enter, “Hi welcome, for how many?” I even had people, mostly a white people ask me “Hi do you know where this is” at Walmart when I was 13, in my blue school uniform. My mom was baffled going “Excuse me! My daughter is 13, what makes you think she works here? Do you think every Mexican you see works here? Get away from my daughter” the lady said “Geez no need to be rude” yet there was a Walmart worker, with an obvious uniform vest with the logo and word Walmart who walked past us. LIKE HELLO?? I LITERALLY HAVE A SCHOOL UNIFORM THAT SAYS MY SCHOOLS NAME ON IT. Dumb betch. Had schools even tell me, “You should go where YOUR kind is most known at”
I think the half you half animated you worked really well! Great video as always Tuv
"And then John Luis spawns in" is why I'm subscribed to Tuv
X-Men
What I hate is that other white people are racist enough that it makes not racist white people automatically racist.
Nice shoes man
The family matters episode was also very good educational episode
I felt bad for carlton, realizing that hes gonna be treated differently than white men. Loved that episode. 💗
Shii i dont blame cory bro i aint doin no 500 page essay
racism
i love a lot of these and the proud family, family matters and a ton of other shows did really good episodes about r@c1sm and other issues if you wanna do a part 2 or more like this.
6:23 bro really used on of the bangers from conkers bad fur day
This reminds me of rabbits invasion Forgot what it was called but was about blue vs white
“Black people can’t marry white people” got it dawg 😭 said ts with so much enthusiasm too
this was a great video
The Steven Universe one...the comments are a complete L. making them gay takes away the message and distracts people? gay is normal. how is that distracting? they're just gay. that's it. it's as normal as if they were straight. it's normal.
12:07 best show ever btw
black an Asian at war !! make a cartoon !!
You know racism isn’t real because folks look up PSAs about it and down vote them all.
black man leve his familie its a fakta poor faters , and in this cartoon the realty is up side down ..woke s
Cyborg and Starfire will always probably be my favourite way to tackle such topics
I respect your decision on your cartoon guy, but can you please change his eyes? They are way too big,  he looking like an anime character back in the 80s and 90s
The steven universe one could have easily have been an ad on homophobia they put too much in there for it to feel real even though the idea wasn't bad at all like the behind the scenes shot
500 pg essay is wild
I like that you are using 50/50 face and cartoon. I like your face more but i like the word cartoon so it balances out and i like both equally. Maybe it could be your face 1/3 of the time, 1/3 could be a picture or image of something, and 1/3 can be a picture with your lil cartoon guy on screen talking. And on the parts with just your face if theres a small picture you wanna put you can put it in the corner, but not covering. Idek
Can you please make videos where you show the content and not speak? You're very annoying.
I love that you're feeling passionate about creating atm but you don't have to commit to weekly uploads.  Don't get burned out mate. x
Mexican turkey tom
vids are fire, music is ass tho
please get rid of the png I strongly dislike it
tuv we need your face in all of the videos :(
So to be fair, Arthur never had racism since everyone is an anthropomorphic animal. The Brain is the only chatacter who is confirmed as black. They inserted racism due to parroting the george floyd incident. So, PBS created racism in a cartoon that never had that issue. Just like msm creates issues irl.
Lol your character looks depressed
I love you tuv
Cartoons that were cancelled before they were finished. E.g. hotwheels acceleracers
17:57 why it look like analog horror video 😭😭😭💀
I loved Arthur growing up, and honestly every time there was a celebrity guest the face animation always creeped me out.💀
This just made me miss Static shock even more besides spiderman Static shock was my favorite superhero to watch
16:20 why’s his face so detailed bruh 😭😭😭💀
"Son where can I find these cartoons?" - 👴
cool video
You shouldn’t curse then say Jesus’s name in vein
Cartoon is tuff
That dude on the back...
You know it's bad when woke cartoons were good back in the day.
I wanna see more real Tuv 😭
idk why but i was lying so much attention to the shoes i love the apocalypse culture bapes
I dont think the inclusion of a gay couple in the first psa was too distracting. I think that was kinda why they put it in. To show how a gay couple shouldn’t be distracting and how it isn’t any different from a straight couple. I kinda like that, that gay people aren’t being treated as tokens, but rather just another couple no different from Steven and connie
Damn, I remember your meme page and you wanted to become a youtuber. I'm glad you followed your dreams.
I used to stand on a trash can lid and hoped to God that I could fly around and zap people when I was a kid, Man I love Static Shock.
that tuv png character hurts my eyes
This is probably one of your best vids
Prince of Bel-Air has some great racism messages, I’ve been watching the show for a while and they address it often. Carlton saying that the police were our friends was so innocent and shows how people in different financial situations see things.
Thanks for the video can’t wait for the next video see ya take care tuv
Static Shock is still one of my all time favorite cartoons.
Racist Mr Incredible
Is that cartoon permanent
Static Shock was so 🐐🐐🐐🐐
New Earl drop; "you could wear em"
15:11 brother Elwood is real
u are so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16:20 bear Louis looks creepy
TUB!!! 🛁
Man tuv, I love your stuff, but I almost feel like Earl should be your "vtuber" mascot rather than a cartoonized version of you 🤔🤔
it’s cool to see Tuv adding in vtuber/pngtuber elements in his videos and just trying out new stuff.
I love that you're starting to cover cartoons on your channel. Maybe there could be a part two to this video about cartoons approaching other serious topics? (Maybe drugs, divorce, bullying, poverty). Keep up the good work.
oh shit he consistent
My favorite cartoon episode that tackles racism is the Teen Titans episode “Troq”. It has a really good message. The racist in that episode doesn’t change, but the heroes come to the conclusion that his view doesn’t matter. As much as I like Stadic Shock’s anti racism episode, and like how the Dad changed for the better, the sad truth is, most racist people don’t (there are some that do, and that’s great, but those are the minority). But in the end, racist people are trash, and there are plenty of people who aren’t prejudice whose views really matter. It puts a positive message on an otherwise dark reality.
tuv is so entertaining that the merch segment is fun to watch
J.a.r. comments aren't the best place to go to for reactions to shit, him and his fanbase area mess
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY TUV!!!!!🤩😍🤩
Do more cartoon videos!! Like creepiest things in cartoons or something
Tuv you’re beautiful bro don’t let anyone tell you otherwise
versus racisn approached in One Piece
It's March 14 the day that Krabs fry's
I love Tuv man, every single vid is just so well edited and probably takes abt 2 or 3 days and you obviously love your fans and it is just amazing because there are so many celebs and yourubers who see there followers as "numbers" but you literally have full first thanking all of us. In other terms, thank you for the hours and hours of entertainment.
I got a bit silly and now I’m in a white box
5:59  Here’s another fun fact if it wasn’t mentioned already in the comments…. Dwayne McDuffie is the half brother of Keegan-Michael Key. He (KMK) has said it on Pete Holmes’ “Make It Weird” podcast that his sister was tracing their genealogy and his discovery of his bio dad. He brought up the fact that he found out he had two half brothers, both died in their 40s and without him ever meeting them. McDuffie did a LOT for DC and Marvel industry and is missed terribly.
Can’t even cap I been profiled by a cop before and it’s crazy cause I’m black but look white. Only thing that gave it away was the hair. The curls and shit. Still crazy to me cause I was profiled by a grown ass guy when I was like 9 bro. Glad the other cop called his bullshit out tho. Hope that guy’s doing well but damn
Should have covered SpongeBob addressing race. It’s the episode where the sea creatures and sandy are discriminating against eachother for being from land and sea. It’s funny asf
Today is March 14 the day of the Krusty fry's
whos the long headed dude
I thought this was a blameitongeorge video at first
11:57 I don’t like that man I don’t think children should make blm poster or protest at all
8:12 I feel wrong for laughing at that
ADVENTURE TIME IS NOT A KIDS SHOW😡 oh and great video love your channel and have been subed since 80K!
FYI bro, it's called a Domino mask, not eye mask 😉
my favorite was when they casually used the hard r back in the early 2000's
Tuv should do a tuv week, daily uploads for a week.
Static shock was my favorite cartoon growing up
that steven universe complaint sounded like casual homophobia. being gay and being black or anything other than white aren't mutually exclusive, nor should either prejudice "take away" attention from the other. if you're not for gay people, you're not for gay black people and you're not for all black people. i know a few black queer friends who felt seen by that psa too, so it's just bizarre. intersectionality should not be met w/ that kinda response.
I like south park "racism"... its a ironic satire about how society is hypocritical about these matters
Cold goes so hard
I hate the cartoon lol reminds me too much of Turkey Tom 😭
AY WHAT WAS EARL DOING?!
the turkey tomnification of tuv
As much as I wish it wasn't, this kind of programming is important.  I think all of us who aren't Caucasian can remember the first time we were called a racial slur (I'm Afro-Latina so for me it was my neighbor calling me an "N-word Sp!c")...I'm adopted and even though it's been 20 years since that happened, my Mom still says that was the hardest day for her as a parent.  So, as heartbreaking as it is, it's vital to teach these lessons early on in order to let every child know that they have value and worth, no matter what color they are or where they come from.
Bro I had this video playing in the background, in the corner of my eye I thought I saw a Hitler stache I turn to look but I just see the character nose ring.
im freaking out over his little cartoon on the album cover its the cutest thing i've ever seen in my whole life
Steven Universe is amazing, I didn't watch it until a year or so ago, and I'm in my mid 20s, absolutely loved it. I think with all shows, fandoms can get problematic even with no support for the behavior from the show/writers/etc. I thought the message from Garnet was nice, people just need to be aware. If you're fortunate enough to not learn about racism by being a victim, the least you can do is learn about it by being an ally.
i remember watching the fresh prince episode. i didnt even ralize it was about racism, i just thought it was a giggle.
What was great is that the shows back in those day knew how NOT to sound preachy or bring others down in the process of making their point.
Fun fact about Fresh Prince of Bel Air  Will Smith created the Fresh Prince character for his early rap career, he can be seen playing him in songs like "parents just don't understand"  The show is kind of a continuation of that song timeline
Bro gotta bring that chin outta the spotlight and let it rest for a minute!
MfFFF I KNOW you did not put Static Shock here for the love of god I've been gatekeeping the hell out of this show so Tik Tok and DC will never remember it exists SHUT UP!
Did you see the episode of family matters where someone painted the n word on a black student's locker?
Mmm no proud family????  Jk, great video
5:18 I rlly like ur tattoo!!
who tf says black people cant marry white people like bitch THE THING SHOULD BE THAT THEIR BOTH GUYS                                                    idgaf if their gay its a joke
There’s another episode of Thats So Raven that really touched my heart, Eddie has a monologue where he explains that his best friend as a child was white but one day his father tore them apart because he didn’t want his child to have a black friend 😭 That’s So Raven has many good messages from positive body image to being anti racist, im grateful I grew up watching it
My favorite cartoon shows that tackled racism was static shock, that’s so raven and Arthur. I love when kids shows talk about to stand up what you believe in and doesn’t shout it in front of us like All the new kids show.
Wish i could watch this with my gf but she is asleep and i cant wait
You should do a video on the show tomorrows pioneers It was war propaganda but for kids yeah kids that would be a cool vid
Tuv if you wanted a demographic on how reasonable people react you could have done a lot better than just a robot
I really enjoyed this video, Static Shock was way ahead of it's time.
NICE VID
My dumbass thought it said racism approved
Dawg really 💀
I love these cartoons. It's a great example of how media can demonstrate the issues present in society within demonizing the common man or degrading peoples identity. That and the fact they don't shove it in your face makes these shows definitely a 10/10 in my books.
I actually really like the avatar and can totally understand tuvs decision to use it, it’s nerve wracking having your face on camera constantly
This is dumb
Someone needed to prepare me for Arthur John Lewis before I watched the Arthur segment.
We gotta celebrate our differences
“That’s so Racist”
Yo
nah man. Cherry soda is of all time your best song, no cap.
man thats a L avatar man
I’m baffled how people saw two gay kids in an anti racism ad as being too much or whatever. gay people existing and racism being a problem aren’t mutually exclusive  if u got mad or weirded out by a gay mixed race FICTIONAL relationship (which within the fiction was also scripted) you Really got a problem lol
So glad on of these videos was uploaded i was just going back through this kind of content saving it great work keep it up Tuv 👍
Hey tuv i really like your videos
I love the mix of face and cartoon character
You should’ve seen the other Steven universe anti racism video with pearl that is a dumpster fire
I am sorry but through the entire static shock part I every time he said “Vergil” just kept think “I am the storm that is approaching” my humour is so ducking broken 💀💀💀💀
Tuvington
bLck pePlE cAN't MaYrRY wHIte pEplE
I would like to see your take on cartoons that weren't afraid to get dark
6:25 why is he under the blanket 💀
The one in steven universe is actually funny, because at the end they say it was acting so I guess being racist is the right thing
the fresh prince episode was a huge one I have never forgotten that episode especially
That blooper for the earl merch was great lol
I actually remember that episode of Fresh Prince, it hit hard at the time and it still does.
I think the best racism topic was in the super Mario super show
Part 2 please
the fresh prince of bel airs handling of racism was so down to earth and raw that it honestly feels like something that would happen irl  without the goofiness ofc
i was expecting for the arthur part for you to mention the "hes a knitter" scene
I’m one of the die hard fans of Steven Universe, and I find their SU racism PSAs very shallow.   The delivery of the messages is so painfully fake, it almost seems like they were made just for brownie points, and they ONLY discuss “Black VS white” as if other racist dynamics don’t even exist; one even spreads the claim that Lewis Latimer is the true inventor of the light bulb, which is simply... not true, so misinformation on top of that.   It’s so weird and sad to see, because the main show is so good at delivering heartfelt messages and discuss real issues.
That Arthur episode wasn't really about racism though. Only if you believe the white principal had reason to be prejudiced. Because she was convinced by a black character. It just seems more like abuse of the elderly or exploitation. But color was not directly involved.
YES FACE TUV IS STILL HERE
I haven't seen you in forever man good to see you back, last time I saw you was when you're ice berg videos were starting to go viral.
Omg living for the earl plushie
great video!
Ok I'm new here but who is the guy in the corner left of your video 17:01. It's freaking me out
I was on there I promise 11:46
My man has a Avatar!
@tuv I will 1000000% buy a shirt if it was my name is Earl themed
He's a..KNITTER
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
Photosensitivity Warning for 2:19
As soon as I seen the manager I knew she was gonna be racist she looked like one of those racist people in like every movie or TV show😂
about your new cartoon guy---this video is much better than the last one in my opinion. he isn't blocking everything and isn't as distracting
The static shock episode is one I've always remembered as a white kid in a really mixed trailer park I can so clearly remeber thinking "his dad is an asshole" not understanding racism at that age yet given I had grown up exposed to a lot of people that didn't look like me
i think your little character is cute and charming! :)
Who saw the sesame st video and said "Man I better dislike this.".
All the Cartoon Network fans will remember when Garnet ended racism
I grew up watching Arthur. Weirdly human faces for special guest appearances is normal from what I remember
Steven Universe is a direct cause for racism and hate.
That episode of Fresh Prince was one of the most well put together, thought out, and powerful scenes from my childhood. I think I was around 13 or so when I saw it, and it was the first time I think I truly understood racism. (I'm a white male) Now, being in my 30s it allows me to be more passionate about life and what other people have to endure day to day.
Opp
Bro your birthday coming soon btw
This is properly executed dealing with racism in cartoons. This is 100 times better than a complete race swap of characters we grew up with and cutting out all jokes that might be perceived as racism when it actually is not.
"No I'm not a knitter"
Why racism has to exist
The Garnet PSA was funny as shit people are just haters.
This is an amazing video TUV. Honestly one of your best.
Tuv uploads save my soul
lol
IM PREORDERING MY EARL PLUSHIE NOW
Says it's about cartoons, only half the examples are cartoons. Also should have brought up the Troq episode of Teen Titans!
It's just thar the character seems bit over designed and edgy. Maybe try different art styles
I’m glad when cartoons teach about racism like Static Shock the episodes I watch they properly demonstrate the affect which I really appreciate
I just found you today lol you had me at the Leafys chin joke 😂 All around great video 😊
I remember watching that That's So Raven episode when it aired on TV
tuv, you should watch steven universe omg
Never watched Arthur, but I've always assumed it's goated for some reason!
wdym with “too progressive”
Tuvington also I was looking for vid links
How is that's so raven a cartoon 😭
Considering how ducks appeared in the first/second series of Arthur only from then onwards to disappear I wish Arthur did an episode tackling racism with their avian characters.
Fresh prince ain’t no damn cartoon 😂
The complaints on the Steven Universe PSA are definitely just homophobia. There was nothing blatantly gay being said, it was just two little kids going "let get married", homophobes just so so hyperfocused on the fact that two boys said it and screamed about it in the comments, but all in all that PSA was actually a pretty decent approach to racism even if it was more straight forward with its language.
Sesame Street has tried to tackle racism from the start, although less overtly. Look up the character Roosevelt Franklin.
Static shock has many different episodes that do so much on big topics.
luv tuv
also on static and gun, dunno if was the same episode, but it had a bullying PSA too, where a guy was bullied and bullied massively, not getting help from teachers or even his parents, he got to the boiling point that he brought a gun to school and tried to shoot his bully, and accidentally shot Static's best friend, when he was trying to mediate so he didn't commit a mistake he can't go back from, and Static was struggling too because it was too hard to not blame the bullied guy for shooting his best friend, despite being extremely evident he didn't mean to and that he was pushed to that limit.  It was very heavy, and the feelings and expressions of the bullied guy were way too realistic.
Straight flamed leafy 😂 I remember the good old content cop videos, truly the golden age of YT
glad to see u again 🤗
i think the sesame street one is Ironic cuz there were some clips at the sesame street theme park where the workers would push black kids. As a black guy although I get that it's bad, it was kind of funny
I found the SU PSA kinda hilarious. For a show that has had openly queer (coded) characters from beginning to end, the fact that the queer element of it wasn't even brought up felt almost like an intentional "C'mon guys, we're past this. Get over it." Its ironic that that's what so many people took issue with.
6:25 why u tryna hide him tuv?????????
For the mic problem you could try upping the decibels your mic catches
tuv is probably the most chillest guy on youtube lol
i'd really like to know how that's so raven is considered a cartoon
I remember when I was watching tuv back way before he hit tuv and him joking about him changing when he hit 1 mil subs and now he has 1.5 mil and I'm glad he's doing well and this is the best content I've seen so far and how far he has come.
He really wearing the earl sweartshirt

Hi
One important one on a show i grew up on before your time lol, Family Matters episode called "Good Cop, Bad Cop". Or another information episode "Fight the Good Fight".
Pin this pls
Hey man, since this video was about racism in kid's shows, can you please do a video discussing how kid's shows handle same-sex romance?
This shit i trash not u but this bs and I’m black
this guy needs extreme therapy but also needs extreme disney cartoon
i actually cried when steven universe and rebecca sugar started being super woke. i can get behind education of certain things in american history that dont get much light. but to call me a bad person for having white skin , that was just too far. i was raised by an actual racist. i was beaten for dating a puerto rican boy and my father said if i ever brought home a black man he would kill us both and smile on his way to prison. yes i married a white guy in the end but it has nothing to do with skin color. his soul is far more important to me than anything. so when i get called evil just for having white skin it especially messes me up. my father physically abused me for having crushes on asian men (anime vas and kpop boys). its insane that this shit was put out for children
Imagine hating someone b/c of their base stats💀Hating since day 1😭Like bro we can't re-roll.
Was the principal from Arthur changed?
do more dark web stuff morbid man
I love you put cartoons but half of these aren’t cartoons lmfao
I like the video where you did most disturbing movie scenes so I want to see  part two
It is great seeing these shows trying to teach a lesson about racism but sometimes I feel they need to have more minorities and not just the old "Black vs White" sort of setting (Although they mean well). :)
The arthur thing is more of a sit-in than a boycott but that's just me being nitpicky.
Shows like Sesame Street and Bluey are why I can like children's programming. Both touch on real life issues and teach kids healthy ways to deal with said topic.
"why are you brown..."
The memes of the Steven Universe psa are CRAZY
people disliked the steven universe one bc they thought it was too woke. it’s clear from the way ppl responded better to a white man explaining racism instead of a black woman.
Ngl got cold on repeat, shit slaps
Static Shock is an S Tier cartoon, man.
just curious, but for the steven universe one, can’t they just be gay? what’s wrong with it? i mean i understand that it may distract some people from the main point of going against racism, but why is it a big deal that it’s gay too? again, i’m not trying to be cruel or anything i’m just wondering why people reacted like that
is nobody gonna talk about the 9/11 thing at 0:03
Kinda funny that this video came out today, I am a mixed child, I'm black and white and just today, I got called a monkey by someone who was just my 'friend' to make fun of me. They called me that behind my back. They constantly called me a monkey regardless of how many times I'd ask them to stop, they'd still do it. they'd act like it was just a joke, but was it really? Even back in February at the black history month assembly we had, he would constantly be laughing and asking ME what words the speaker would say even though they were words everybody uses, not just black people. It just annoys me in general, like just be normal, skin ain't shit, it just covers the insides of our body so what? Get over yourself.
The Fresh Prince episode about Carltons blackness is a really great one as well. He isnt accepted into a fraternity because he is deemed not black enough by another members. Carlton eventually stands up for himself at a party and the rest of the fraternity sees.
I am surprised that the Teen titan's racism episode didn't come in.   Edit: I am talking about the OG, episode "Troq"
Do you have any songs in the pipe line that sounds like tommy lee? I really love that song
love u tuv
Cory? Is that the kid that got the spin off that everyone calls anime?
hey tuv! just out of curiosity, would you ever consider using character pngs made by other people as fanart for your png on screen? :D like you could have a little collection of them
I grew up with the Fresh Prince. It was one of my favorite shows aired in the Netherlands and I watched it with my family. There were a lot of situations my parents took the opportunity to explain and educate me on racism, and specifically racism in America - obviously they have their own history as well. I loved how they explored the personalities as well, how anyone can be funny, sexy, professional, an authority figure, smart, dumb, etc. The show undoubtly influenced me since I was young and I am grateful about it. All I wish for now is an expanded exploration of those families and I hope we get to see more.
Seeing as I didn't grown up during Jim Crow, I was completely blindsided the steven universe psa, I felt ambushed even. The first time watching it was just weird, having grown up in the 90s I was bombarard by so many psas about diversity, like BKKC of every flavor, stuffed into everything I watched or consumed. So to have this just sprung out, I felt like I had missed an hour of lead up or just skipped to whole another psa.   The historically important black people psa was also strange, it took on this technical truth angle in order to make a point. Like with Lewis Howard Latimer, he made improvements to the light blub, specifically carbon filaments, but that doesnt mean he invented it. Like he should get credit for improving the lives of many people but not the credit for inventing it. Or the Black Knight, a highly debated part of Arthurian legend. What we do know is that the black knight stories were written by a danish man I believe. So he wasn't real, its still a cool story to tell kids but you saying 'oh he's in Arthurian legend therefore he is real' is really stretching the truth on the matter.
The dyslexia P.S.A from Static Shock was how I found out I had dyslexia. I remember watching it and thinking "oh, that explains a lot."
I think to use the little cartoon of yourself a little more, perhaps there needs to be more variety with the characters' expressions? It may be more art to comission from people, but it could look a little more engaging visually if the character had more facial expressions to switch to 👍
I think the Steven universe ones suck comparatively because they didn’t like, make an episode that illustrated a point, they just preached. Even tho they tried to “show, not tell” they failed at that and just came across as annoying and not creative, where as the other cartoons actually illustrated a story to prove a point. The Steven universe ones are just uninteresting and stupid compared to the others
Tuv has become a png horror channel
Tuv is popping off on releasing vids
Good fan art but why was the BG the EDP Sting operation
I don't think that cartoons should use real world events to cover a topic. I believe Arthur or at least the old version of arthur, made an episode on trauma around when 9/11 happened. And they handled it pretty well since a child is not going to know what the hell 9/11 was, they aren't going relate to it. But a child can relate to a school situation since well, children are going to be in school during their youth.
Hoo boy
new tuv video🚨🚨🚨🚨We just took a fat W
I think with both character and live might be too busy but love your content so I'm not going to stop watching just because you made a change
Tuv you're not that much younger than me stop making me feel old by saying "I was too young to watch these shows" haha
Lots of DC fans in the early 2000s say how underrated static shock was… clearly as I never heard of it despite watching the likes of btas, justice league and teen titans a bunch when I was little.
Love how Arthur finally graduated 3rd grade after 27 years. 💀
All the comments: man, this is so sad 😔  Me: yoooo I just noticed his spirited away tattoo!
Thank you for this video, you made me stop with my casual racism and making me go competitive
Static Shock handles issues so well. There’s also the gun at school episode that was great. Media nowadays could learn from it. It’s not oh look racism or whatever issue is bad. There’s more to it and it’s real. I loved Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The episode with Will confronting his dad gets me bc i can relate
Maybe you could make a video about The Owl House season 2 episode 16 "Hollow Mind"  it's really dark for a kids show
Good job, man. But honestly, I don't mind if people take a while to upload. They do have lives, after all. Plus, it's like a nice surprise when the do upload. I'm just saying, no pressure. :03
Oh God I just seen the Thumbnail as well smh...
That’s so Raven and Static Shock did it so well. As a lil black boy I already knew about racism but I thought those two shows explained it well.
Static Shock was so fuckin good🔥🔥
the best thing to come out of the steven universe one was the meme where it stops at the frame of it revealing it was a set and its captioned "it was all fake. be racist"
If only shows nowadays were able to execute that.
Tuv back at it again with a banger 🔥
tuvington
Some of these shows do what woke media wanna do so bad but fail completely at and then some.
The “YES, YES” really got me
I feel like it'd be hard if you do a video on lost episodes, either lost media or the creepypastas.
TUV Is the rip-off version of @blameitonjorge @tatstops ,🫠
Great video as always and I really like your new song cold (defiantly my favourite song so far)
tuvington
How does one not watch this classic show? Even my younger sister who’s tuv’s age watched it
11:50-11:52 Racist twitter in a nutshell:
im disliking because of the pngtuber avatar you made
Hello I’m here
Static Shock did better the racism episode without the use of the two n words racism PG style
Animated tuv is both beautiful and nightmare fuel.
I remember watching that arthur episode that was fire i was so entertained
That static shock ep really stuck with me when I was young up to this day bc I feel like could relate with richie, fuck racism
Next vid  Top 10 anime betrayals?
I feel like nowadays people try to hard to make kids have a sense of a choice. Like how some parents put the idea that it’s okay to change your gender and all that. I don’t have a problem with LGBTQ, and I actually have some friends who are gay. It’s just that these kids minds aren’t fully developed and they shouldn’t be able to make life changing decisions at that young of a age.
The hate towards the new Sesame Street BLM and Antiracism videos is so unwarranted. The videos are so wholesome and take a really deep look at how racism effects multiple ethnicities and its in a mature yet child-appropriate way!
That's So Raven manager got cancelled from life, ain't no way she working in a job that has a livable wage.
Arthurs pretty deep they have a diverse cast, an episode discussing cancer, a gay wedding episode--talks about BLM-man, be like 'Arthur' >*
*Yall remmeber the george floyd situation when arthur did a special commercial short it had 'parental advisory' labed on it.*
*"GARNET SAVES THE DAY!*
*"NO, IM NOT A KINTTER!"*
a lot of these aren't cartoons
whats with your eyes? have you relapsed? D:
But how did the father know that he's the superhero of his own dad can't even recognize him?
Noooo why did I have to fall asleep and be late to a tuv upload 😕 I’m always usually one of the first people to comment
tuvvvvv
Suggestion: darkest anime series?    Credit: ​気持ち 悪い
ohhhhhhhh
Uhh what happend to you m9?This video was pretty mid.
Businesses, "I'm lust building the economy."
It’s crazy because I am bi racial. My grandmother is a white woman. I was driving her car which is a Lexus back to our house. I was racially profiled and pulled over. Asked all these type of questions. Once I called my grandmother and told her to come. (I was about 2 blocks away) and everything changes. They first told her to get away but once she explained it was her car, and I’m her granddaughter they became very nice.. she didn’t understand what we going on because once she showed up they let me go. Now she is not clueless to racism, she met my grandpa in the late 60’s early 70’s they became a couple. She just couldn’t believe  that this was happening 2019…
how can he see the dislikes
Damn, I can't remember any episode beside the racist dad one. It was that good.
I think people despised this sesame street blm part because people see blm as violent
steven universe is cringe lmao i was a hardcore fan but the writing is atrocious. The PSA was also cringe lmao
I think its always good to have both a face and a cartoon to the brand. because you can use your little goober cartoon character for merch and your face can be used to become more recognizable
Here at 6,701 views.
what is even the purpose of the tuv cartoon in screen, the style is so overplayed and basic
Nailed the Steven universe into though 😂
Teen Titans. Episode: Troq. The entire episode is based on the prejudices against Starfire's people from an alien super-hero, Val-Yor.  There is an interaction between Starfire and Cyborg where she tells him about how her people are treated, and instead of completely undercutting her struggle and shining a light on the subtle evils of the people of Earth, Cyborg allows Starfire to believe that people are prejudice towards him only because he's half robot.  He understands the struggle of Starfire due to his skin color, he is embarassed of Earthlings because of it, he doesn't want the focus to come off of Starfire, and he doesn't want Starfire to feel uncomfortable around Earthlings because we suffer from the same pitfalls.  And by the episode's end, even though she saves Val-Yor's life and shifts his opinion of her (but not her people) it shows that even just one act of kindness can't change a trait that is deeply ingrained into people. And the Teen Titans as a whole were willing to burn that bridge with Val-Yor as opposed to putting up with his mindset. The lesson being, instead of focusing on how to change other people's way of thinking, it's better to focus on the people who are worth your time.
Ah yes a white man making a video on racism
I kinda like the avatar of tuv better than the actual
doubt you’ll see this tuv, but why did u delete ur video about reiko?
ily
Woooooooo go tuv
*Static Shock is such an Iconic Manga*
thats so raven was corny but had some gs episodes
The thought of a Sesame Street puppet being racist is soooo outta pocket💀
🕳️
We love you mr T ❤️💯
It's garnet from Steven Universe Kids, don't be racist  Cartoon network solved racism
And saddly till this day there are many reacist people🙁😟😞
You’re not a real YouTuber if you don’t have an animated character
Hey man no worries if you want to use your character, dont feel any pressure, aslong as your enjoying making the vids whichever way your comfortable with, were enjoying it. Thanks for the vid tuv
1:46-1:51 Bro Just roast lefty
The "your life is going to be more difficult than other people" from Bel air hit me, even if I'm white, because that applies to mental health, LGBT issues, and every minority, Wich I'm both LGBT and ADHD, that's why It hit me hard
Yes i loved static shock lol and osmosis Jones
6.k in Js an hour, we need more people to accept the fact he has better content than 97% of all of yt
BABYGIRL TUV DROPPED SO I CANT PICK YOU UP TODAY FROM WORK 😈
good video but half of these aren't cartoons lmao
Yup static really pulled of some tough topics. The racism and homeless eps was among my favorites
bro talking about racism in cartoons are problems with racism and right after he mentions his friend brandon making it sound like that lets go brandon stuff lol💀
High quality editing
NEW TUV VIDEO!
NO IM NOT A KNITTER
I've always loved watching the old real life awareness kids episodes, they give me nostalgia even though I was never born in those times.
regarding the tuv-sona, i think itd definitely make it even better if he had more expressions! i think what we like about watching ur face is that u can express things u can't really get verbally, and at least personally i think the cartoon tuv is just a little too static ^_^ i definitely think using the same sprite but w some little changes to his face (specially mouth movements) would improve it a lot!!
Is good I guess
The first show suddenly brought back so many memories of watching this back in elementary school. I forgot the name, thanks Tuv.
Tuvington
Trust me if you think John Lewis was uncanny, then search up Matt Damon Arthur
Interesting video bro ❤
I remember Arthur talking about cussing I remember the guy pressing the button for the beep 😅
I kinda relate to the dad in the first one
I forgot how bad the art was in Static Shock. The art did not age well at all! 😟 But on a serious note, why didn't he just kick him out of the house? What could Static really do about it if he didn't let him into the house?🤨 Okay, so, yeah, he's racist. I get that. But if you're racist, why would you let him in the house? This is so unrealistic! And why would Static even WANT to keep being friends with Richie after overhearing his dad? That's crazy! A normal person would be too afraid to keep hanging around.  I REALLY don't get the PSA ad. Why did the kid not bully them for being gay? The world hasn't changed THAT much! There's no way any kid would be able to look past the gay part. Heck, either one, really. But gay marriage would COMPLETELY override anything kids normally bully other kids about. It's like the person who was responsible for that ad doesn't know what a child is! Do they even REMEMBER being one?!
I need a earl sweatshirt
tuvington
Absolutely loved the video, if you happen to do a part 2, please talk about the family matters episode where the father stands up to a fellow cop for profiling his son. That one definitely stuck with me the most.
imagine you're just hanging out with your buddy and suddenly the phone rings and some stranger is just like *white people and black people can't be friends* then hangs up.   that's some creepy shit and that shit happened on SESAME STREET.
this aint degenrocity
In the 2000s, these topics were usually handled very well, with the lesson usually being we should all treat each other with respect no matter the color we are all human. Kids are manipulated by the parents to somewhat hate or distrust those who don't look like us. This unfortunately still happens in society of all ethnicities, especially those who seem to only see color. Static shock was an amazing piece of media that I enjoyed as a kid, even though I didn't fully understand most of the topics at the time.
Bro Carlton for most of the show doesn't even know he's black
How so many views and likes in a hour
love ur new cartoon character in the new videos 🥺❤️
Who is that guy in the background?!!? There is an old white man lurking in the corner of his bedroom
*That So Rave had a child actor* with parents who were feeding him with horrible junk like MacDonalds, colas, chips.  I with there would be responsibility for parents who maim their children like this.
Meh
I don’t get why shows don’t talk about other races in dealt to racism. For example the Jews.
Wish there were more things telling brown kids to not beat up me and my white freinds
Good examples, great points. But it’s kinda funny how a video about cartoons takes half of its examples from live action shows
I love tuv
the steven universe one i think became a meme
loved the vid, great content. But if you have not watched Fresh Prince, do yourself that favor.
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING MY FANART IN THE VIDEO! It means so much to me <3
I like when u use the character as well as ur face honestly lol
HE PNG NOOO HES FUCKIN PNG
only og's get the reference in the first piece of tuv art
I thought he was gonna talk about the “he’s a knitter” in aurthor
The differences between how Marvel vs DC vs Dark Horse vs Indie comics.
Arthur John Lewis is terrifying.  Anyway, I remember being shocked when Francine told Arthur to "Go eat an ant sandwhich" I mean in their universe wouldn't that sort of comment be considered racist?
face connect emotions better
Barf. 🙄
The Steven universe one is baffling.  Like, yeah, it's the fact that they are black and white people will make fun of or hate those boys for.if they get married... And absolutely nothing else.
Yooooo TUV!! Great pick for a new video!! Soooo dope that u have uploaded so "consistently" pal!
Dude I love when I see your face. Idk why it just keeps you at the forefront of the channel
18:58 people are mad that it was an lgbtq+ couple?? That sounds really strange and weird to me, the focus of the ad is very clearly about racism. If you're distracted from the point of a psa bc it shows 2 gay people maybe you're just homophobic..  like lgbtq couples don't exist outside of pride or lgbtq acceptance videos. What weird take from people that are mad at the video
Ahh yes, fresh Prince of bel air.. my favourite cartoon
Arthur will always have the gold medal for the best cartoon for me. So nostalgic.
Static Shock is and will always be such a great show I feel lucky to have been around while it was still airing
If ur gonna have an animated character to stand in for you, I think you should use earl instead of yourself.
I'm glad I don't have to add you to the anti-woke douche list, man. I had my concerns about this vid when it was announced. But can I be real? We all know that the arguments against the Garnet PSA are all excuses. The user who made that video is most likely a libertarian and, therefore, untrustworthy, as all social messaging in entertainment is ''propaganda'' to them. It's the same issue with the Pearl and Amethyst PSAs. They don't want Gen Alpha turning on them and their archaic values. It's wholly beneficial to their continued existence that these kids carry on believing Thomas Edison invented the Lightbulb and that they never learn about critical race theory, as both these things are direct threats to conservatism.   So they decry them, vote bomb them, all the while waxing nostalgic about the days of ''innocence'' when ''kids were kids'' and cartoons were ''just fun.'' There's a reason their videos never show the garnet PSA in full context. Why they never go beyond her saying ''Don't be Racist'', because it's a coping mechanism, the first 38 seconds are a satire of oversimplified psas, but they can't admit that. They need an ''own the libs'' meme, otherwise, they have to contend with the inescapable fact that their way of thinking is going extinct. Kill the meme, you kill their peace of mind.
The tragedy of the Animated Spider Man. (Several just ok shows then the amazing spectacular spider man that was cut short by the higher ups, and then we got the 2 worst shows, ultimate and marvels)
this probably already the plan but you should use the pngtuber when you are actually showing something on screen and show your face when you aren't
i love racism
12:16 technically he’s playing William Smith not Willard Smith
Steven PSA prolly got more dislikes cause of it bein a film set honestly
We need a top 5 most racist people ever(i am one)
yeah the stupid pngtuber shit can stop, it looks rlly stupid can we not. im embarassed of anyone looking over my shoulder
I looked at the title and just got shocked
so impressed with the style and editing of this video tuv, keep the good work up!!

How the fuck does this have 6.6k likes and only 6.1k views?
Ten years from now, I want to see an example of reverse. Ex: black being racist towards whites etc. Problem is it would be a hard message to come across smoothly considering that black were the ones that were historically discriminated against and at times still are because the last generations who did haven't died off yet. Maybe a cartoon about a kid from rural nowhere moving to a progressive city (like San Francisco) because of family issues and he is seen as racist or a hick because of his background, or a white kid at a predominantly black school, or an Asian not allowed at a school because the school sees Asians as over-excelling even if he's not top of his class, etc.   I don't have to give real-world examples on situations like these happening because in the end, we're talking about cartoons, and I feel like examples of white on Blacks, Hispanics, Asian, vise-versa, and crossing over in between would be a good way to tell the viewer that racism is wrong, period.
My favourite will forever be cyborg saying of course he understands what it's like ti be treated differently because of how you look becaus3 he's part robot
i saw this video and i said “TUV RACISM YAY😁” on accident*
did you use your feet to hold your camera in the self promo
for some reason i always play your videos when i play splatoon
1.58 million subs already... Always a good day when tuv uploads
They used to approach Racism far better than now. Now it's just Racist but towards white people.
Usually when I hear cartoons and society fussing for one episode, I get a little bumed.I feel like the episode is just an lecture instead of an story on whatever the subject is.Another thing is most chacerts that are the villains or in this case  racists are to over the top for me like the situation is either a joke or doesn't come off real.BUT for Static shock I actually found it impressive for the subject.There was conflict, a story and a nice ending and it felt a little more real but still having a nice end.  Steven universe was a little out of pocket though,  like gems doesn't have racicts, they just have human forms.Also maybe instead of getting angery about how a dude made the filament, maybe talk about his other ideas or how he made it.  Same goes for Arthor, like their animals, they could be speciest but more animals come in darker colors of brown. Also arthor can't be like that but in the beginning have a little dog next to it with a leash.but idk that's just my thoughts
The Steven universe one I saw a meme where it shows the camera crew and it says it was all fake be racist
I hate the lgbtq
I like the difference in audio as well as the character showing up I have a really low attention span, so the change in audio quality helps me focus on the video if that makes sense This might be for my weird self personally, but still!
I understand it now so your not a meowbah luckly xd. You have beautyfull big black eyes.
Wait did anyone notice when Mr.Foley is holding his son before hand shaking Richard. He has an ungloved hand and then during the handshake a second later he has a glove on?
There’s a racism moment is ravens home the revamp version where a white police officer arrests a black man for no reason
black people can't marry white people~~ that shit is so funny
te amo tuv
i always randomly come back after awhile and the content is always upgrading 🤍 much love
"Viiiiirrrrrgil, I'd like you to meet my roommate from college- Shaquille ooooO'Neal" *_(actual Static Shock dialogue)_*
Ok Do 50 50 then
5:11 THAT'S THAT BLACK WISDOM FOR YOU BABY! CAN'T GET THAT NOWHERE ELSE! 🔥🔥🔥
I haven’t seen a video of his in a while
"Truth is I don't hire black people 😌💅" 😂
There is this show on Netflix that did do something about that it’s called family reunion sec 1 episode 10  called “Remember our boys became men”
Tuv, love your content and all but racism is NOT systematic in America. Name one law that is in place today that suppresses any race, you won't find one. Also in the case of Static Shock they weren't trying to say that racism is systematic, they were showing how heavily laced with bigotry it is and talking about the assholes keeping it on life support through exposure to shitty mainstream media that promotes it.   So there's no such thing as 'white privilege' nor 'reverse racism' and we all just need to come together to stop judging each other based on something so trivial as the color of someone's skin. That's what most of these cartoons were condemning (I say most because those steven universe shorts are pushing a terrible narrative that if your a minority your voice can't shine through).
No not fucking carton
Meow
We love your little character :) Keep doing what's right for you!
Nah dont become hanna opp phew
Sweet more content to watch from tuv
Awesome video! What is the song that plays at 6:18 in the video? :)
The fact that you didn’t play the clip where uncle Phil tells the cop off is a crime
Tuvingttoooooooonnnnn 🗣️
Another cartoon that should be mentioned is Teen Titans. The episode is titled Troq; I’ll follow with the synopsis: The Titans meet Val-Yor, an alien superhero who is on the verge of ending his war with his long-time enemies; The Locrix. The Titans volunteer to help and immediately take a liking to him, but their opinion of Val-Yor may soon change once they find out what he truly thinks of Starfire.  It’s one of my favorite episodes from the series, and it tackles racism in a way that kids and adults can understand.
We see the tattoos bro…
Me:*having a bad day* Tuv:*uploads* Me:*hapinez*
I love your videos
Wait what about that one teen titans episode?
1:48 what chin ?
Omg I remember when I almost cried when he talked about his depression on his second channel 😨
You missed out big on not mention boondocks and it's legendary Uncle Ruckus
W shows
Can u make a vid on cartoon sus/18+ jokes
You are now manually breathing
there was also teen titans
Oh Tuv, you made me feel old saying you didn’t grow up with Fresh Prince! 😂 But I remember liking that episode even as a little white girl because it gave me a perspective I hadn’t seen before. I was a little too young when it aired to appreciate it, but when I saw it a few years later with reruns, it had an impact on me. I never knew my Black friends could have it so rough just for the color of their skin. Thanks for including it in this video!
that john lewis THING is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life
Enough about Earl’s racist past, it’s time to discuss Earl’s racist future 💯🗿
Babe wake up tuv actually put up a video instead of a short /j (no hate)
u like how south park can handle racism better that the woke steven universe show can.
I feel bad but you said they were coming from China I didn't want to buy a anymore
I enjoy staring at his mouth, in a straight way.
I find it humorous that the Steven universe one, the kid wasn't homophobic he was racist. I find that hilarious because of how counter productive that is.
This is why we gotta take a stand at the systems with peace. ♥️
I remember watching the TSR episoide when I was a kid, I've never forgotten it
I'm sorry bro, love your videos but that avatar looks like it was drawn by a 4 year old in 10 minutes
This reminds me of blamitonjorge haha
I’m loving more Tuv content. I like the new PNG too. Poor Earl got demoted
He played Master William, when his real name is Willard, so it’s a completely different Will Smith.
Tuv make a vid abt leafy‼️
The Proud Family Reboot had an episode in colorism but they didn't handle it that well...
You should’ve included that episode of the Proud Family where Penny is sent back into the segregation era and learns the importance of MLK jr.   That episode was a huge wake up call to me, especially as a white girl living in a white community.
Good video. But can we talk about a cartoon that at it's core was about racism? Avatar: The Last Airbender. One nation was literally so racist towards others that they wanted one completely wiped out and the rest to bend to their will.
Bro no the earl transition bro 🤣 I cringed so hard
I think you should use the character when you're reacting or explaining the content you're trying to convey then camera for when you add your own commentary or takeaways. Nonetheless awesome video as always!
your new video format sucks
definitely just waking up…
For as many life lessons that it taught, static shock was a really underrated cartoon
but why have the charecter just talk over the video lol you had the formula dont fuck with it
9:10 yeah that still happens today. A coworker of my boyfriend wanted her husband hired but they wouldn't hire him because he is black. Nothing has changed at all since the early 2000s
Love this channel watching since 100k subs
Where South Park lol
Hello  I watched his videos for 1 year today

Why did i thought this was a degenerocity by the thumbnail hahah
for the fresh price of bel air my parents used to watch it and i was 5 at the time so i didn't know that it was about racism i though it was just some stupid cop who didn't know how to do his job which i guess is true but i didn't think it for the correct reason
Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air

If you feel pressured to use your actual face you should use your little character, I’m fine with anything❤️

Hold up…Tuv is that a pregnancy pillow I see during your ad? Tbh they’re comfortable asf so no shame but I want to make sure I’m seeing right 🤣💕
Great video!! I don’t see the point of the cartoon if you don’t want to show your face you can just do the voiceover
Kind of funny that if any of these episodes came out today people would them woke, but some of these came out over 10 years ago
fresh prince is honestly the best one. not only does it reflect on the racism that the victims sometimes face just because they a "minority", but how they FEEL. it must be hard that no matter what personality you have or if you're a criminal or not , people are going to take one look at your skin colour/race and think "this man/woman does not deserve to enjoy a happy life like me."
Turkey Tuv
W tuv vid like always, yo songs r the best music on my playlist ong
Still a fan, liked and shared!
to be honest, the complaints about the steven universe psa makes no sense to me at all
Me not a fan of this character thing you started once you got big. Very weird. You’re putting the pressure on yourself. If you’re going to use a character at least make it something not cringe asf
Cartoons breaking the 4th wall
Your avatar kinda resembles Turkey Tom’s a little bit it’s just the face   I still like it tho
Wow I loved this vid :)
U forgor the mario cartoon with their racims episode
TUVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
i love the new consistancy keep it up
It's Twitter, of course there is braindead negativity.
Can't forget about teen titan's fabulous episode on racism and slurs
One of my favourite racism episodes in cartoons is in Teen Titans, because it felt more like a realistic approach to portraying racist individuals. Racism is just ingrained into some people and they'll sometimes never change even if their lives are saved by the "inferior" race. It goes on to highlight how powerful and deeprooted the issues can be.
cartoon iceberg?
i was today years old when i found out the garnet "dont be racist kids" was real. theres no way that wasnt satire.
Based tuv
Does earl exist
tuv try to stay consistent challenge: (IMPOSSIBLE)
Top 10 YouTubers to watch while power is out.
Hi Tuv today is my birthday and your video just made it even better! Thanks for uploading it on my special day!
yk we gotta be early😈
The 4th one made me sad... I just feel so so bad
The steven universe one was so silly. Like bc they were gay it took away from them being uneducated???
i love you mr tuv make more music its very good
I Don’t know why i thought this was a degenerocity video
“black people cant marry white people! Don’t be racist kids.” And cut! It was all fake
Earl looks like squidward
Oh nah lil bro becoming a VTuber💀

I remember seeing so many black faces in tom and jerry and i remember racist moments in warner brothers cartoons like looney tunes and i remember seeing lots of black people and faces in tex avery like droopy dog 🐕
good video tuv i like
Oh good old days watching static shock before going to school
y
You're a knitter!
How is a toddler holding up a sign saying black lives matter  be holssome?! Reallly wtf? Making child radicals is holsome?  Create future blue heard victims. Be anti racist?!? Wtf? Isnt that the same as Be normal, treat people the same. Its like feminists trying to teach boys not to rape wrf?!? Why do the alphabet group call straight supporters of theirs allies? Making sound like its a war. Allies vx Axis
I’m just commenting so the algorithm helps tuv lmaoo
all these would be called woke grooming of kids now
It's funny that the Static Shock racism story ends up being 100% about the white kid being in peril due to racism.
why John Lewis look like Lego Clone Wars Mace Windu
Bro ur clothing brand is really good but its also cost alot
i'm really glad you're getting all the traction you are, it's well deserved : >
The fresh prince of bel air is my favorite cartoon
Tuv you are amazing your videos are perfect it doesn't matter what you want with your character
As a kid I loved that Static Shock episode so much
Yay I’m ear,y to my favourite YouTubers video!
Teen Titans also had an episode on racism back in the day, titled "Troq". Basically a big name space hero, Valior, comes Earth, following some hostile aliens which he ends up taking out in front of the Titans. Then the rest of the episode is the Titans going with him for hero work and the whole time, everyone gets along with him and him with everyone but Starfire, who he refers to as "Troq" while just being a general dickhead to her. Cyborg, being a concerned friend picks up that it bothers her and asks what it means, to which Starfire replies "It means nothing." As in "It means he's saying I'm worthless and nothing." but it's taken as "It doesn't mean anything" and is later used by Cyborg as a nickname for her. Predictably, this pisses her off and Cy kinda just gets confused and says "I thought you said it didn't mean anything?" which is when it's clarified that it means that she's nothing and it's a racist term for Tamaranians. And god... Cyborg's response here is great as an adult he basically says he's faced discrimination too because he's... a robot. But there's the slightest hesitation in his words and as an adult you can pick up that he really means "Because I'm black" but he doesn't want to ruin Starfire's view of humans. The episode ends on Starfire saving Valior's ass from dying despite the fact that she could have left him to die. Then he says the typical "I guess not all Tamaranians (blacks) are bad. You're one of the good ones." to sorta just signify that like... yeah, this guy's still an asshole and changing a racist's views is incredibly difficult. Go watch it if you can.
Static shock knows how to deal with that stuff, better than other shows..
Static Shock is the goat, some cartoons were dumb and fun but shows like Static legit raised me and taught me the golden rule while being entertaining enough to keep a young me invested. They touched on racism, mental health issues, stranger danger, gun control and even homelessness. Are there any cartoons teaching kids that many life lessons nowadays?
WAKE UP NEW TUV VID JUS DROPPED ⁉️
Wanna mention Teen Titans (the good one) had an episode where an alien is racist towards Starfire had she solved the problem in the best way possible. Made2Express made a video on the episode and it’s great.
I won’t lie the Sesame Street episode is so darkly funny
tuv, i love you but i cant drop $75 on a hoodie. nothing your shop is,, budget friendly? not everyone can afford these prices to support you
Finally some good content.
Some of these arent cartoons
that's so raven has so many episodes on real world problems and it was definitely an amazing show. it was my favorite show growing up and its still really good today. Episodes ranging from stealing to smoking. definitely worth watching <3
I remember watching the bel-air epp as a kid, it was how I learnt racism was a thing, glad I got to see that as it likely help shape how I view the world
please do darkest regular show theories 😭
The 50/50 for face and character is a great idea :) you could shift the ratios depending on what’s comfortable for you at the time
Grand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic; Before the events of the game, he fought in the Bosnian War as a teenager, was betrayed by one of the members (which got most of the squad killed) and is now obsessed with getting revenge. After fighting in the war, bad circumstances led him to work for Ray Bulgarin in human trafficking, which ended with Niko being blamed for a sinking ship and leaving Europe to escape Bulgarin's wrath and power. While spending the next seven months in the merchant navy he made the decision to move to Liberty City, where his cousin Roman claimed to be living a life of luxury (as well as to hunt down one of the two suspected traitors, Florian Cravic). The game begins with Niko getting off the container ship "Platypus" and meeting his cousin Roman. He quickly finds out that Roman completely bluffed about his lifestyle, both as a joke and to recruit help, as he is living the average life of a poor immigrant in Hove Beach. Niko spends the next few weeks working at Roman's cab depot (making friends like "Little" Jacob Hughes and Brucie Kibbutz in the process, as well as a girlfriend Michelle) and fighting off his loan sharks - this eventually leads to Niko killing Vlad Glebov, a Russian mobster and one of the sharks, for sleeping with Roman's girlfriend Mallorie Bardas. Subsequent to killing Vlad, Niko reveals to Roman that the real reason he came to America was to find Florian Cravic, a man who he thinks may have betrayed him and his squad during the Yugoslavian Wars; he claims that it was either Florian or another man named Darko Brevic. Immediately after, they are kidnapped by the Russian mob and before they are both nearly killed, Niko wins over the mob's leaders Mikhail Faustin and Dimitri Rascalov to work for them instead. Because Mikhail is a violent, irrational sociopath (even by organized crime standards), he has Niko kill the son of Kenny Petrovic, the most powerful Russian mobster in the United States. After a short while, Dimitri tells Niko that in order to avoid being killed by Petrovic, he must kill Mikhail. They successfully kill him and appease Petrovic, but when Niko is to receive payment, Dimitri reveals that he is now partnered with Ray Bulgarin, a former employee of Niko's who thinks Niko had betrayed him, and tries to have him killed. Niko, with the help of Little Jacob, manages to escape. Now, Niko and Roman, whose Hove Beach apartment and cab depot were both destroyed in a fire started by Dimitri, must leave Broker and hide with Mallorie's cousins, in the northern borough of Bohan. Mallorie introduces Niko to both Manny Escuela, a community organizer making a documentary about his good deeds, and Elizabeta Torres, an extremely influential drug supplier (who, in turn, introduces Niko to Playboy X during a heroin deal and Patrick McReary during a gun exchange). Through Manny, Niko is blackmailed by police chief Francis McReary into silencing people for him, including famous lawyer Tom Goldberg. As the authorities close in on Elizabeta's drug ring, Niko's girlfriend Michelle reveals that she is an undercover agent and Niko will be forced to work for her boss. Elizabeta is arrested and sentenced to 300 years (but not before she kills Manny and his cameraman for trying to citizen arrest her for publicity). Niko moves on to work for Playboy, who is embarrassed to welcome back his old-fashioned mentor Dwayne Forge from prison. As their views conflict and their friendship deteriorates, Playboy and Dwayne each try to have Niko kill the other. Niko's decision of who to kill is one of seven pivotal choices in the game, left to the player. Niko is paid twenty-five grand to kill Dwayne, who could be framed as suicidal, delusional and ready to die. However, if he kills Playboy, who could be considered very greedy and disrespectful to his mentor, he is rewarded with his penthouse and car (worth much more). Niko also does very secretive work for United Liberty Paper, the front company which Michelle's (real name Karen) superiors cover themselves with. Niko is ironically told to kill other criminals who immigrated from Eastern Europe, for their ties to financing terrorist activity. Roman is kidnapped by Dimitri's Russian mob once again, after his gambling habit led him to "gambling in their private club". After Niko rescues him, Roman finally becomes a millionaire and purchases a luxury condo for him and Niko. Soon after he is contacted again by Patrick McReary, and begins working with his family and friends in the Irish mob (also finding out chief McReary is his brother). Niko becomes a family friend, eventually dating Patricks sister Kate McReary. Niko is introduced to Ray Boccino of the Pegorino Family, who employ Packie's crew as extra muscle. Ray leads everyone involved in a messy, complex diamond deal that pits them against the Jewish Mob and the Ancelotti Family, resulting in the death of Jewish Mob leader Isaac Roth and the kidnapping of Don Ancelotti's daughter, Gracie Ancelotti, to demand back the diamonds that were stolen back from them. The diamonds are lost in garbage during a firefight between Niko/Patrick and Ray Bulgarin again, who was the very first owner of the diamonds. Niko is later forced to make a choice of killing one of Patricks brothers, Francis or Derrick. For his assistance, Niko demanded that Boccino lead him to Florian - he successfully tracks Florian down, who changed his name to Bernie Crane. Niko discovers that Florian/Bernie was innocent and a closeted homosexual (leaving Niko to hunt down the real traitor, Darko). Niko continues to help Bernie as a friend, helping to ward off blackmailers of his boyfriend, closeted politician Bryce Dawkins (the demands, control of construction unions, are from Dimitri and Ray Bulgarin of all people). After his help they have a profound friendship, and Bernie rewards Niko with an Infernus supercar. Niko works his way up in the Pegorinos, eventually meeting their boss, Jimmy Pegorino, and working directly for him (eventually, he is told to kill Ray Boccino). United Liberty Paper contacts Niko again to work for Jon Gravelli, the head of the Gambetti Family, the city's most powerful mafia family, and now on his death bed. In exchange for his help, United Liberty Paper kidnaps Darko (who lived in Bucharest, Romania) for Niko to confront personally. Darko admits to betraying the group to pay for his drug habit, and Niko must make the personal choice of either killing him or, as Roman encourages him, forgetting revenge and letting him suffer alive.
I actually like the blend of real face and cartoon png face, just adds a little extra something to the videos and who knows, could be a possible merch item with it in the future, I’m looking at u Tuv.👀
amazing vid
To make your kid to love and embrace everything to do with your race, is the gateway to being a racist. Once you look at your race in a bigger, better way than others can only go one way. Dont teach to embrace,  celebrate your race.  Treat everyone the same, dont see one race better than the other,  Morgan freeman said jt the best whe  asked how do you stop racism: "stop talking about it"   move on.
hi
The “zaaaaaaaaaaaamn” tho at 5:17 💀💀
As a non-black kid, who lived in a mostly white area but did have black family. That Fresh Prince episode really hit me hard watching it as a kid!
Love these kinds of videos
That knitter scene from Arthur will forever be etched into my memory 😂
I'm still gonna miss your beautiful ass face though
Only 3 of these were cartoons
I remeber seeing the that so racen episode and being so confused i legit asked my mom if that actually happens, bc i had never heard about that before it seemed so wierd and Strange to me
DAMN BOY, $75 FOR A HOODIE?!DATS CRAZY
Great video!❤
like peter griffin once said
7:50 aw hell nah what 6th grader is doing a 500 page essay
What’s that ugly cartoon guy in the start
why is tuvs camera quality actually insane
the editing in this video goes crazy
1:09 Bro Rizzed me up, chill out
Rename the video.
The mic being close to your face isn’t a big deal.
I find it hilarious that the video is called “Cartoons that dealt with racism,” and then proceeds to talk about like 3 live action shows, one of which is aimed at an older audience.
love your content so much bro
Ayoo the static shock was while 😂😂
I missed ur cartoon vids
Early! Do what makes you happy tuv :) face or cartoon I'd watch you. I've been watching you for so long and you always bring me joy with your uploads.. thank you for uploading today I needed it. I love your cartoon or gaming videos by the way but I love ajy of your videos hehe :) amazing work!!
I like the idea of you using 50% PNG/cartoon character, totally understandable reason! You're awesome tuv, thank you for uploading Videos like these🥰💕
I luv the cartoon edit of you.. round of applause 👏👏
I say this as someone who typically can’t stand PC culture, (although don’t get me wrong anti-PC culture is just as bad) the Steven Universe PSA is cringe but it’s absolutely not because the kids being gay somehow takes away from the message. It’s actually a great thing how the LGBT part of the PSA wasn’t even mentioned by a character since it means it’s not being treated as a big deal and I hate it when something as trivial as a character being LGBT or a minority is treated as a big deal in media with a few exceptions (has anyone here heard of the visual novel The House in Fata Morgana? If not go read it it’s one of those exceptions!) so I have no clue what the problem those people had was.  EDIT: just to clarify, I still say that the PSA is cringe just because of how disingenuous it felt if you get what I mean?
out of all of these I remember watching the static shock episode as a kid and it gave me shivers, like that episode is a reason that show is so good
"Cartoons"
I always get so excited whenever u post it's always so interesting!
"Hey when we're older, let's get married!" "Ah you can't get married!" "Why not?" "BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T MARRY WHITE PEOPLE!" *Garnet Appears* "Hey now" "It's Garnet from Steven Universe!" "Kids, don't be racist"
I remember seeing it approached in Arthur
Tuv is someone who I am constantly concerned for.
John Lewis from Arthur looks like the even more handsome Squidward after he gets hit with the door lmao; Great video though! In a world where tackling racist and social issues in shows is considered "woke" it's nice to reminisce in a time where it wasn't..
I think the cartoon can work IN tangent with your face, while your showing footage or a picture you can show the little character but when nothing is going on screen you show your face.
Tuv has gotta be the most humbled and charismatic commentary YouTuber despite covering dark topics
I actually liked the way Steven Universe covered racism, it was in a simple and brief way to explain prejudice. It's weird how people thought it wasn't appropriate or wasn't done right for kids making it "Woke" or whatever but why is it that? Kids can experience racism why can't other learn its not right?
You have to love that 99% of the clips were white people hate black people . lmao .
my guess here is that the main reason why a lot of people disliked the steven universe one is because it was 2 boys being gay in front a underage audience
OMG TUV HAS A LITTLE CHARACTER YAY! 😁😁😁
7:51 500 page essay, hoo boy thats worse than my 10th grade English teacher
hey man, are you getting enough sleep? you dont look well with those bags under your eyes
babe wake up, tuv posted
Great video! Huge fan, love your videos as always! 😊
Here before viral tickets 🎟 like to get one! Also free pop corn  🍿
some of these arent cartoons! (read that in your head with the voice of a kid with a "thats not right, silly" voice lol)
The arthur one was incredibly low key.
The intro's are so high quality
Oh No... This Video Ruined All My Dream is Collapsed. After Watching this Video.
I HATE THE PNG THING
Hi tuv 😃
turkey tom stills💀
helloooo
the character usage is very unique and I would like to see more of the turkey tom like art-style or different art-styles used for the cartoony version of yourself and I wouldn't be surprised to see a earl cartoon in the making in the next couple of years
bro this only had 40 likes when I got here now it has 1.8k likes 🎉
the way i almost  didn't click the notification because I thought it was another short
you know, i really like static shocks approach, i think it was a truly well done way i'm genuinely glad some shows are takinng this topic seriously. i am white (with different blood cultures german, cherokee, french) but most of my sibilings are of colour mixed and i love them dearly . i will show anyone static shock. in the small chance that issue is ever upon me. i cannot stand racism
Damn
this man just making whatever atp
earl don't blink if you're being held captive and need help
im so early
BABE WAKE UP TUV POSTED
What happen to earl😫😭😭
Kind of ironic how Raven would completely 180 on her views on racism later years, mainly on discrimination on "ghetto names".
Keep up the good work!
amazing vid tuv! lov uuuu
Tuv is back 👀😬
Most cartoons werent meant for kids
instead of taking clips from your vids and making them into yt shorts, you should find quick topics and use your cartoon guy for the whole short
500 page ESSAY? DAMN BRO
Hola comos es continuar
Hey tuv I love ur content, ur definitely one of my favourite YouTubers and keep up the good work and stay safe out there ❤❤❤
Speaking of racism, my friends call me blacky 💀
I think this subject should be taught cus of how important it can be
I put the earl in early
bae wake up bae posted i mean tuv posted my fault
A new tuv video 😼🎉
hi tuv!
Maybe it's because I'm autistic and tend to think in a point of logic.... But racism makes no sense to me. Never has, never will. Hating someone over their skin colour is extremely stupid.
I remember that one Teen Titans episode that handled racism pretty well
I feel so sorry for Carlton. It really pulls at your emotions and was a great way, at the time, to show racism.
You can do whatever you want with your character, i don’t mind. Love your vids
don't wanna be too negative, take this as constructive critisism. I find the cartoon kinda cringey ngl. too much dark and big eyes. looks kinda edgy ngl
❤❤❤
little cartoon guy is weird... but whatever makes you comfortable and makes it easier to make videos
The liking your character more is understandable as someone who has anxiety that can get quite bad I fully understand Tuv dw about it. Have to say though the face makes it feel more personal
static shock was the goat, that ep always stuck with me even into my adulthood
You should make earl blankets
I love this topic/style video so much! Even though the main topic is super heavy, I feel this video is super light and fun.  I hope this was a great detox for you! (esp after that crazy USB series!)
Hi Tuvalu 👋
Doing race episodes can be very hit or miss, as an attempt to teach children good morals can end up having a worse lesson
No noti gang, but I’m still here early, I’ll change the noti gang part now  I am now part of the noti gang
TUV SUPPORST ZAZA
Why does your character still look like Horace from The Problem Solvers
I luv tuv.
3:49 bro why he looks like mr incredible
God this editing is insane.
1:57 ngl i like the orignal mic better 😭😭😭
Hey Tuv thanks for doing what you do - that's all, carry on
LETS GOOOO NEW TUV UPLOAD
wake up, tuv uploaded.
another great video as always
You know it’s a good day when tuv makes a new video
OMG YES IM FINALLY EARLY YES TUV EVERYONE STREAM EAR CANDY👊👊
I like the cartoon character of yours but I personally liked Earl more
I love u papa tuv ❤😊
Remember those cartoons you had to watch in school that were made specifically to be like an anti racism psa
After this vid ima hate that gumball cuz I hate blue skinners 💀
I needed a Yt video to watch while eating
Hope your staying well, great video. EDIT: Wow grew up and watched some Static Shock, never saw that episode but that was hard, they didn't f*ck around.
That’s so raven - my favourite cartoon

CARTOON VIDEO IDEA: Disturbing Cartoon's Hijacks: i would love this idea to happen & i know someone already made this idea, Tuv i would love to see this happen! ❤️
=]
One tuv video a day keeps the boredom away
No issue with the avatar. I know how much added work that can add from an editing/recording perspective. I've been debating getting something like that too.
do a video about the hottest cartoon characters
ayyyy tuv posted wake up
Kids. Don't. Be. Racist.
It’s awesome idea he covered this
I LOVE TUVVV
This a interesting thing

Hi tuv
Hello tuv
5:45 in a way I like the way static shock brought up the situation
Hi tuv it’s my birthday can you wish me a happy birthday
hi tuv
Please add Velma too if its not added here . Biggest pile of dump I've ever seen
Love you bro 🤟🏽
I love the new editing so much!

Static shock impressed me so much with that episode. One of the greatest episodes of my childhood
yo tub the fan art you looks like that one cousin that's cool and a pothead /pos
crazy how much Tuv’s account has changed especially in quality
static shock oml

Hate the animation tuv
18:22 if you want to spread a good message, please don’t make it sound goofy or cringe
Let’s go tuv
love your videos tuv!!! keep up the great work ❤️
love consistent tuv
Tuv could make a documentary of the use of condoms in eastern society and I would still watch it
20 minutes and 11 seconds of pure joy
I was sing alone from ear candy but I found is video
i clicked this video faster then the speed of light
what if earl has a dog?
DAMN IM LATE  Btw i want u on some ordinary podcast
Hy skedadudlers

I think the avatar should be replaced with earl (even though he doesn't exist)
Kids, DONT BE RACIST Whole world ends racism thanks to cartoon network
Wow I made it before the 5 hour mark nice
Oh my lordie lord🤪
Ayo only video that distract me from studies 😂😂❤❤❤

Anotha 1
what other cartoon-related video ideas would you guys like to see?
I’m early asf 😂
I really like the lil character :)
Keep up the great videos, stay on the grind brother!
when we were taught to love and accept everyone but now it’s like we’re taught to hate white people
Loving your vids tuv. Also on my opinion on the little character, I like it though I did like earl a bit more.
To be honest, I've forgotten that racism was utilized in old cartoons.
Hey bro 😎
Hi
Early ish
I really do understand the concept of teaching good and bad things to children but at times I do feel these topics kindaa should be kept away from specific children again not that children shouldn't learn about this cause statik shock does it so well but idk some cartoons should be kept as a plain comedic relief
Another day, Another Vid
Racism is bad
Do y’all like pop tarts
You know it's a good day when tuv uploads
tuv the best frr🥹🥹
wait im early i just realized
Dog
this shit like a netflix show the budget getting higher and higher tf man this look like a documentary 💀

My favorite way a cartoon approached racism was in Teen Titans - Troq
Oh shit early gang wassup, love your vids bertie !!
