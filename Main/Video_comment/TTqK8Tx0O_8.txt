8:24 🧢

I love how Dana just gives the same answer for every question
That’s two fights in a row Dustin accuses a fighter of putting their fingers in his gloves. Hmm.
*Tony Ferguson and Khabib press conference* Dana: This fight is definitely going to happen  This video: Dana: “When have we ever lied about a fight?
I just wish Dana wouldn’t say “I could care less” such a dumb thing to say. You couldn’t care less sir
Dana’s the best. DANA for president
The look on his face was where can I bury all these people that I can return later so that I can urinate on them.
Good video
gotta love Dana's living amazon alexa that he gets to repeat all his questions for him
the proper 12 ads is cringe as fuck, do people even buy that cheap shit?
2:52 man was going to say outta your hair but corrected himself real quick 😂😂
6:10 you're welcome 😊
Cap equals avatar idk wtf that means
Jake Paul had a higher attendance at his fight🤣
Lol Florida,Texas, apex
whos darren revell, sound like he goes agaist the grain unlike ufc.
lol danas losing his hair over jake hahahaha
Can reporters possibly ask dumber questions?  Wtf is wrong with these idiots
Come to AZ!
You gotta love Dana lol
i love listening to good interviewers
How many times did Dana say "I don't give a shit"
omg proper #12 just seems to be everywhere lately.
So hilarious @14:49 we being invaded or something? what the hell is going on here?
We love you Dana ❤️
Charles vs khabib that’s the fight we REALLY that match up us soo fuckin crazy but sadly khabib is gone 😭
269 was more like watching completely obvious  paid dives for "entertainment" LOL would've been a good one to bet on the underdog on.
Adesanya vs Usman!
I love how confused Dana was about 🧢
How Pena beat Nunez with that absolutely atrocious 1/2 that was wonky as fuck.....I will never know. That 1/2 was over and over and sloppy.
YEAAAA KEEP COMING TO TEXAS
The reason i dont watch this channel as my nr 1 option is because there are no timestamps in the video description, if you guys did this i will choice this channel over the rest
Let's not forget someone lose over $300,000 betting on Nunez
"He put out a cap" 🤣🤣😅
9:52 the confidence comes from knowing that you were told Nunes was throwing the fight so they could rake in every single dollar bet
Suga show
This guy asking questions seems to think that Dana goes running up to every fighter 5mins after the fight with a note pad! No bro, YOU are supposed to be doing that lol
Herb strikes again... missed the glove grab that allowed Oliviera to gain advantageous position, momentum he kept and capitalised on in the next round ... I like Herb but lately he has been having a 'bad day at the office' to regularly.
These questions suck💯
Dana needs a new sound guy for these things... dude has been failing miserably with the feedback... holy shit.
Dana's conferences are so good they need to be PPV as well.
Its how i make my living sir.
These questions are so stupid. Dana's got a good way of answering
McGregor vs Michael Chiesa who is currently number 10.  If McGregor wins then maybe put him is against number 8 Jorge Masvidal.   They should not let him jump to the front of the line now for a championship shot because he has not been so active.  Fighting Khamsat next for McGregor would be a huge mistake.   McGregor will fight anyone but Khamsat is just a different breed of fighter.  I would love to see Khamsat vs Colby or Gilbert burns next.
6:11
I’ve changed my opinion of Dana a lot over the years.  Although I still don’t like the way he bashes his own fighters, the guy is the best out there.  Like many have said.  He got it done in a very difficult time AND still paid his staff.
The first time I saw Olivera fight was against Kevin Lee, and I was like damn he’s good!
Dana starting to pay them more. Good shit!
Guys I understand you want watch time on your videos but you really should timestamp them for us fans without the time to consume 20 minutes just to find the freaking moment you put in the description.  Your total views would skyrocket if you made more consumable clips.  Great content though, keep it up...
Some dumb questions
Dustin got found out tonight and he’s not a top fighter at all and is wife loves Conner mc
"Biggest non CONOR MCGREGOR fight ever" ......love him or hate him McGregor knows how to sell PPV'S and put asses in seats!!! He was also the FIRST double champ. I miss the Conor that knocked Aldo out in 10 seconds (or whatever the fuck it was)
MMA is the best sport in the world and the UFC has the best MMA fighters in the world.
Oliviera will smoke Gaethje!
How about paying your fighters even when you’re not completely ecstatic? How about just good?  It’s been rough watching one boxer make what all of your stable makes in their lifetimes.
Just put Suga Sean against the better fighter's the only "real" guy he faced was Chito Vera and he lost but I still think he does good against a lot of the other top 5 guy's but he has to rematch Chito at some point.
What does the guy think DANA is GOD like he can predict how the world 🌎 will change with covid and all the bullshit that comes with it.
next olivera fight i'd like to see him not illegally hold onto his opponents glove for 10 seconds
Man I really wanted this for Dustin but Charles is a worthy champion. Nothing but massive respect for Charles.
When Dana says someone has a lot of money he jus tryna make them think he paid em well haha
Some of the questions they ask Dana are seriously stupid and fcked up!!! They should ask themselves wtf they are asking? Jesus some of the journalists are thick as fck
I love dana lol
Hope Dana realises now he doesn’t need Connor to make bulk money. Time to stop giving that clown preferential treatment.
Justin vs Charles could be so sick.
That guy from 7:30 just grassing on fighters for 5 minutes straight haha
Imagine watching Dana say, “looks like we’re going to have to pay him!’ about you?  Daaaamn
Dana is drunk asf right here lol
Say what you want about Dana but he is excellent businessman and promoter! Through all the pandemic chaos he has made sure his fighters had work available to keep bills paid and food on tables.  Sometimes you gotta look past all the media bull shit regarding fighter pay and what not and look at it just like any other job because in reality it is a job and fighters chose and love to do this job! Uncle Dana is actually a huge part of why MMA is what it is today.   JUST BLEED!!!!!!!!!!
These so called MMA journalists ask the most moronic questions. 1 dude literally sounded like a fucken robot. 🤣
Dana is great!
i honestly was wondering what was up with nunes,bc she had no head movement,kept going to leg kicks for a jab or straight to the face...i honestly wondered if she even cared if she lost or not n i hate that for pena bc it doesn't devalue her n shouldn't but yet someone will spin it that way,before anybody tries to say i am just stop...I'm saying facts that everyone watching noticed, it was an odd fight from Amanda and it's not that she lost its how,i haven't seen her that tired in a 2nd rnd especially with how the 1st went...wasn't like the striking or grappling was that out there...some ppl have brought up maybe rona has damaged her lungs (temporarily n permanently I've heard both) but idk i mean all ik was it wasn't a typical fight from her, n my personal belief is that she just doesn't gaf about changing the weights back n forth but maybe rona is what's up but it seemed like she was of the mindset "ok I'll give it my all but if i can't get her out quickly/easily...then I'm done for the night" idk i don't even like saying it like that but damn something was going on i mean hell i watched it play out n was scratching my head way b4 the finish
Dana really had to think about his answer when asked about the co main. He thinks that fight was thrown. Was it?
Listening to these 50 year old men explain to Dana what cap means is hilarious
Great fight card!!! The best ufc I've watched in awhile
some of the questions these guys ask...lmfao
Can’t lie Sean is good just don’t see him beating anyone top ten, prove me wrong dude
Dana White..the Truth Teller..   LOL
“T-EYE-AVASA”
Crazy Texas n Florida was the two worst states for Covid-19 Nd there the only states open as of events
Never take the UFC to Chinafornia!!! Never!!!!!
You alwayz have 2 have a hustle and flow....the Crown 👑 is here.  Music by eminem dragon flaps...bridle illano and insert previous comment
8:45 thats so inconsiderate towards Whittaker wth...
Why does that guy always get to ask the first questions?
What have we been invaded by stupid people tonight.
Proper whiskey site gets flagged by Avast as phishing ...hnmm
Lol in 2015 or so everyone HATED Dana, now he's loved by 90% of fans. He deserves the praise, good job uncle fester
Im totally with Dana, i don't give a shit if anything ever opens again. I live in Florida were straight here. We got the best Governor.
Is it fucked up that the first post-fight presser i watch everytime is Dana's? He's got a way with words man, entertaining as hell
Izzy being a menace lool
Mac life did Dana dirty with that thumbnail
I've already made this comments somewhere else I'm gonna stick to it I can just tell by the way Dana is talking he knows what hes doing was Sean and he knows what's going on sean's a good fighter if hes standing up but if you're a good enough fight fan and you'll have bee   watching long enough you know if he fights a wrestler it's done and why hasn't he yet well exactly you can say who Sean just fought is a good fighter but  either way.....you could just tell by looking at them standing side beside he was gonna take the fight if you know fighting well enough it's like being in high school 2 people go out side to fight  you just  know who's winning that fight that's why it was picked he needs to fight a real fighter to get respect  o definitely think hes a good fighter I love watching him but he needs to fight a real fighter someone that's intimidating
so much chatter behind the camera its hard to focus on the people with the mic, cmon...
awesome card, shit questions
Anyone else get annoyed at all of the media's phones going off? Kinda disrespectful when you've been given time with Dana. Journalists are cretins
12:33 Steve-O's long lost twin sister.
Chiesa did a Connor
8:45 If I wasn't so lazy I'd compile every time the egg has lied.
Ohio Dana business in Ohio. Stipe vs jon jones
Dana : I don't give a shit what happens in 2020 John Morgan : Nice.
Have to admit there have been some solid cards this year int he UFC,
Can you imagine being Dana, every weekend is one of his best nights of his life, out of some of the most successful people in the world he must be the happiest, besides Elon playing spaceships and robots he's also happy asfk. Bezos dreams of boxes..😅
What gear does Dana take? Ill need that when I’m older. He’s out here looking like kingpin
It's about time your giving money out tonight, lmfao
thats how i make my living sir....  lol
fuck dude from LA asking questions making us look slow or some shit 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
Dana is a savage. I love his honesty and confidence. He is a professional 👏 regardless. Some of the questions are so loaded and he handles them so well. True leader of the sport
Darren time stamp?
Dana does not give a shit about these press conferences
Typical Dana once’s he’s ok fuck the rest of yous, imagine saying i don’t care if they never open up the country/world again, and once a narcissist always a narcissist 💯
Tons of performance awards on this special night.
Swedish MP: “The World Needs to Know About These Cruel and Evil Human Rights Abuses” Ms. Ann-Sofie Alm, Member of Swedish Parliament and Member of Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), said that “The Chinese Communist Party’s rule has decimated Chinese culture and tradition. There is no free speech or freedom of belief in China and information is strongly controlled and censored. The Chinese regime is openly aiming for world domination by waging a silent war using information, technology, and money, lots of money.”  She said that in order to retain its power, the CCP uses various ways to persecute its people, such as the genocide against Uyghurs and Falun Dafa practitioners. This horrific persecution has been going on for decades and is still continuing.  “In China…. there are no waiting times for organs. You can even call a hospital and order a heart at a time that is convenient to your travel schedule. If you are willing to pay extra, you can even get a healthier organ, such as a fresh and healthy heart from a Falun Dafa practitioner,” she noted.  She said she was horrified after reading the report from the China Tribunal about the forced organ harvesting. It’s something she can’t forget or keep silent about. “The world needs to know about these cruel and evil human rights abuses that the Communist Party of China is subjecting its people to.”  MP Alm said the CCP had tried to silence her through intimidation. “But they cannot, because I am not alone. Sweden, like the rest of the world, is waking up now and dares to face the reality. The Swedish government, parliament, firms, businesses and our people are beginning to wake up to see what is happening in China. This awareness is growing every day, from country to country, from parliament to parliament, from fellow human being to fellow human being. It is with knowledge that we can and will change this.”  She suggested that with this knowledge, the world can make a change and “call[ed] on the EU and the US and all other representatives and communities in the free world to stand up for human rights in China, and stop the illegal, inhumane trade of human organs from prisoners of conscience in China.”
Man media y'all suck snitching out fighters left and right. I get it though. Snitch life pays

the old guy explaining what cap means loooool
Dana White is obviously pissed off that Amanda Nunes didn't bring it tonight and Poirier got beat. Big pay day plans out the window for now.

Nunez was tired when she arrived to the stadium. Her eyes were red and knew something was wrong.
Cody gonna be nothing more than a stepping stone if he stays fighting. Damn that was a rough loss for him.

10 of the Worlds Funniest One Liners!  1. I went to the fights, and a hockey game broke out. 2. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 3. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.  4. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened. 5. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  6. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 7. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 8. Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk? 9. All generalizations are false. 10. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.   Probably the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die  anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This  is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have  you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever  looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already  with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to  these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Nobody wants to be a hero with a time stamp?

Amanda threw the fight
Amanda got beat because she didn't get in shape to fight!!
Did you guys know that epsteins "pimp" is on trial right now and has many celebrities and top world leaders who were involved with the abuse of children.   WATCH THE IMPORTANT NEWS
Dana clearly is fed up with media scrums!
"Dana White reacts to UFC 269" is trending
Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both For a wounded man shall say to his assailant "If I live, I will kill you. If I die, you are forgiven." Such is the rule of honor  Anyone who is willing to throwaway there freedom to feel safe deserves death. No vaccine mandate no vaccine passport end of story
"I could care less" = that means you DO CARE ;)
the story about Chiesa at the end is hilarious
Sean O Malley - Himzmat!  AKA Khamzat Chimaev!  https://youtu.be/gBMyiHH7-f4
You know Dana wanted to mention McGregor at the last question
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Some MMA media are like lil bitches telling tales to Dana, taking fighter comments outta context trying to create some drama
Im Glad to have been a UFC fan. Non UFC fans don't know what their missing out on.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Dana White is absolutely hilarious without even trying.
Who gives a shit Dana white
What a fight night it was x
Reporter snitching on Adesonya
Is Dana a little drunker then usual?
Cody gonna be nothing more than a stepping stone if he stays fighting. Damn that was a rough loss for him.
Perfect time to do Sean vs Cody at 135
Pena proved to be the Samson to the Lioness, as I predicted.
Dana making so much money his suit sleeves are filled with it.
2nd round. Earlier on. Random Left curve /hook.. Dazed.. Nunes before they kept up the fire fight  Dazed enough . to catch a submission
What's up with that guy asking dumb questions and making stuff up just to make Dana mad 🤡
Dana is still hurting from betting $300k on Amanda.
PAY THE FIGHTERS MORE
Anyboby else just looking at danas arms
Kayla vs nunes is not a million dollar fight
I know Dana gets a lot of heat for being a dick, but damn I love his DONT GIVE A FUCK ATTITUDE about conquering anything he puts his mind to :)
"How do I say this without embarrassing this guy? " then roasts him viciously
Some of the most retarded questions I’ve ever heard. Completely redundant and uninspiring. Terrible room of “journalists”
Cody gonna be nothing more than a stepping stone if he stays fighting. Damn that was a rough loss for him.
the sean o malley fake build up, he fought a number 16 guy who was is now 3-3 in the ufc... he is ranked 14. how is he ready for anything? dont get me wrong i like sean
https://youtu.be/V7yC_O_qNqs
Dana please bring UFC back to Philly!!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates _ 🎈
Dana making excuses for Amanda.  Come on!  “In a 5 round fight it doesn’t matter how big you are or hard you hit….it only matters who’s in better shape….did Amanda train hard?”  Can someone remind him Amanda was stopped in the 2nd round!
Doood…. Dana is so faded
sean should be top 5
If Oliveira didnt cheat and hold Dustin's glove he probably wouldnt of got him down and the fight could of went another way.
Looks like we’re going to have to pay him 😂🤣 damn straight Dana lmao
Big respect to the UFC and all the fighters.  I can't imagine how if must feel to dedicate so much blood, sweat and tears only to lose savagely in 30 seconds for our entertainment. On the flip side.  All that work to gain victory.  It's a rollercoaster and I love every second and so many fighters sacrifice more than we could ever appreciate.  There is so much emotion in loss and victory.  Thank you to you all!!!!
The bit about Chiesa was hilarious Lol
Geez, that reporter that sounds like a Dalek. 11:08 Dana handling it well.
5:22 Dana: "So looks like we're gonna have to pay him" Nah really Dana? Ya don't say. But you did so well not paying guys in the past, like Nate Diaz for instance (re: $20K/20K deal, when you milked him for all he was worth i.e., you didn't pay him sh*t) You F'ing hypocrite
As much as I am not a fan of Nunes, it felt like Nunes was doing a controlled loss - meaning that she was handing over the champion status so she could get out. I believe Nunes lost to Shevchenko by about 30% as hardly any of her strikes hit Shevchenko as they were evaded. Despite that, you get people like Anik and others saying "Whoah, what a vicious strike that landed" when it was clearly evaded. So I think some incorrect commentating and perhaps poor visual IQ resulted in the judges giving the win to the loser. Anyway, I'm saying that because Nunes didn't fight like Nunes. She fought like she didn't care anymore.
This guy is the best !  I don’t give a fuck !
Dana cops shite. But man he’s awesome. No boss speaks the way he does
Sean o'malley getting paid, because of Steve will do it
I like Dana puts good fights together knows a lot about the fight business but he doesn’t know shit about fighting
I know one ☝️ thing, Dana must be pissed that the person that defeated the other person who defeated Mc Proper (Money maker) doesn’t even speak English just like he was with Anderson Silva and Steroid Cyborg
This wonderful bald man made us fans happy the whole year. we appreciate u mr.clean
DANA COME TO ATLANTA GA..    WEE HAVE THE NEW MERCEDES-BENZ STADIUM
“Biggest non Conor Mcgregor gate”🤣
This guy self confidence is inmensurable!!👍🏼
Cruz vs Aldo 2 former champs interesting match up.
Dana, thanks so much for giving us another great year of fights (despite all the COVID junk). Hope you, all the UFC staff and fighters have a blessed holiday season and a great new Year! looking forward to 2022'!
Except the Neal/Ponzi fight 😂🤣
Nunes vs valentina plz
This MMA coverage, these journalists are getting old. It's the same shit, same questions. Dumb as shit questions. What's it mean to have a win? I mean, they are all dumb questions. Then on top of that, stirring shit, saying so-and-so said X thing completely out of context and making it seem VERY different from what you know the person who said it intended. It's either completely intentional or these guys are completely out of touch with everything.
Jesus loves you! Do not give up on your life!  Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2
Sugar Sean is probably the only relevant fight Cody has left
I think every ufc ppv card this year has been unbelievable,, the classic fights kept coming and coming, great job Dana
didnt even need to ask who has the first question, John Morgan just started talking haha
I swear to god, EVERY fucking post fight press conference, either John Morgan or some other clown asks Dana the same question of "have you gotten a chance to talk to so and so" and EVERY time the answer is the exact same. Jesus christ am I the only one seeing this? It's literally after every fight at this point.
Please everyone repost this the Ghislaine Maxwell case is going on RN and the media is covering it with ASTROWORLD please repost this. It’s Media control and we need to wake up!!!!!!!!!!
Dana “ are we being invaded” White  😂😂
I love Dana white
Dana cracks me up man hahaha. Such a stacked card to end off 2021 cant wait to see what 2022 has in store!
I hope everyone knows! That the only reason  you can watch ufc is because of red state's that  are not woke.  or left wing democrat nut jobs.....lol  facts 😁❤🤍💙
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
The description of the term “cap” was tough
Fook pooper 12 and the McNuggets serving it.
So happy to still have UFC as a sport flourishing and wokefree . While everything else damn near is crap . Great night fellad
"when have we ever lied?"  LMFAO Dana LMFAO u only lying to urself saying that
You mean you are underpaying fighters as usual.
I get more info on the UFC from Dana White's post fight conferences then from any other source.
I dont know what the phucks going right now but all my favourite fighters are losing, Nunes, Teofimo Lopez this dhit is unjust lol but i really think its complacency for sure
Dana truly is the goat. He’s delivered probably the best year of fights yet in the weirdest times. Thank you Dana and the UFC team
6:42 Dipshit
That deserved 5 milli ppv buys come  now
Cody should step away man. I’m worried for his health and hopefully he can find a way to stay healthy for his family.
poor Dana his face tells it all
"How do i say this without embarrassing the guy"?  ** PROCEEDS TO ABSOLUTELY HUMILIATE THE DUDE!**
These proper twelve ads 🤣🤣😭😭
Thanks Dana 👍 you made lockdown bearable. Legitimately 💯🇬🇧
Hamilton was robbed!
I fucking love when Dana gets In front of cameras

Dana "when do i lie"😆😆
Derrick lewis!!! Lets gooooo
Just like I said Friday on here before the fight! Charlie boy beat Ol"Dusty. And I also said Amanda's going to lose.
Rovell was right though no cap... Amanda beating Ronda and Cyborg in 2 years was hella hard on the UFC to promote around 💯🤷‍♂️ fight me
Dana white post presser >> actual events lmao
the amount of times I looked on my phones because those messaging noises is actually insane
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                /.,/,/., /.                       ,/.,/.,/.,/.,/. ,          ,/. ,/. ,/,.
You know ?
Dana is looking more like The Kingpin every day
Dana white is the man. He is hysterical. #nofilter
Dana’s pressers are now funny as fuck to me 😂 he’s clearly done with the same old questions and the same old comments, he don’t give a fuuuuck
Do think Dana gives a shit
Fuck LA
Gatchee will beat Oliveria
Why is nobody talking about Amanda looking as if she didn’t know how to throw a punch? Watch a clip of her punching anyone in any of her other fights then watch this fight…..it’s as if she forgot how to throw a punch. I hate to say it but, she was swinging like a girl.
Man these questions get worse and worse
Was that a leprechaun?
Joe Rogan was spot on calling out olivera cheating putting his hands in Dustin's gloves  which is the only reason he got the take down that drastically changed the entire fight and allowed olivera to smother and be on top of Dustin for an entire round. Wouldn't have got the take down if his hands weren't in Dustin's gloves , go watch the replay and see . Some shady shit that herb Dean didn't see because herb continues to miss shit all the time.  Herbs been under more scrutiny than any other ref and blasted online for poor judgment calls and or not calling things . Dunno how the hell these refs miss such obvious bullshit in the ring , if an announcer can clearly see it happen and call it out the ref who's next to them should see it. Pretty fucked that Dustin was on the short end of the stick with this one , hopefully the footage goes around more to bring awareness to this issue because it's very unfair and screws over the fighters. Worst part is olivera knew what he was doing which is fucked,  really liked the dude before seeing such shady shit. Cheating is cheating and there should be no room for it in the ufc when people lives are on the line. Like both fighters,  just hate seeing shady shit like that. I could clearly see it as did everyone watching at our party so it should be addressed.
How is Chael even doing commentary? He's wrong way more than he's ever been right.
Uncle Dana on a roll tonight-!!
Justin don't stand a chance
Come on Mc Double chin Morgan-!  Dumb questions give the Schmo your opening spot-!!
Can someone with a personality get the mic first? Thanks.
Oliveira deserves FIGHT OF THE NIGHT.
Dana: When have we lied?
“I didn’t hear any of that stuff.” Let’s you know that he heard Brendan say that hahaha.
he's sounding more and more like Trump lol
This just in. Cody Garbrant is switching over to women’s bantam weight
9:26 let your intentions be known my guy
UFC is one of a few huge corps that publicy slams this whole covid shit, props to them for flipping the finger to everyone for it.
Over here ratting out Izzy
awesome event
Dana's attitude is so aggressive
Chiesa does what he does on alcohol and yet marijuana is still illegal it baffles me
What an insult to fighters to get $50K bonus, after taxes is peanuts
Love Dana's "I don't give a shit attitude".
Cruz all the way
Dana is mad inside that Nunes lost marketing wise 🤷‍♂️
Something leads me to believe Dana is a little irritated that Amanda loss and he probably lost a shit load of money he seems different this post fight conference just saying.
Why not just say hat instead of a cap no one says that wtf
Shout out chiesa for making me feel normal for fucking up drunk lol
Olivera vs islam is gonna be fucking crazy
I lost a lot of respect for woman’s MMA when Peñas slow ass ugly weak windmill punches were effective against Nunes. Just showed that the level of skill in those fights is far below what I thought they were
Well Charles got to defend it once,congrats....Now Justin is gonna take that title smooth from him.
Hunter Cambell is such a lawyer. DO YOU HAVE A SIGNED CONTRACT FOR ADESANYA TO FIGHT WHITTAKER? YES OR FUCKING NO LOL
2021 is the best year of fighting ever
The UFC has had an absolutely magical run as of late. Every PPV has been a banger
John Morgan save some questions for everyone else.
Codys chin has been gone since tj. I hate to say it. But hes done. The ufc should cut him to do him a favor
Yo y’all’s mics…disgusting 😂😂 jokes
Yo I'm sure it wasn't rigged but damn nunes fight looked pretty suspect. Like hey we need to mix your division up a bit and make things interesting for the fans
Does the fat guy reporter always get to ask the first 25 questions at a presser? Every other sport the reporters get usually one question and on to the next
Conor doing proper twelve commericlas is always jaring to see
Cap ..adesanya  🤣
Would think Dana could get his suit tailored to fit
*I think Nunez vs Harrison would still be a big fight especially if she gets her 135lb belt back*
Damn I wish dana was a boss of mine 🤣🤣🤣 my boi “dont give a shit”
All Cap!!
THE LEFTISTS WILL HATE THE UFC !!!!!
Put respect on Pena name period
When has the UFC lied? 🤔
who gives a shit
All these reporters just run there mouth the whole time
Was very sad to see Dustin lose, but incredible by Charles. Great fighters the both of them I hope Dustin gets another shot at some point, but regardless he is an amazing fighter with a lot to be proud of
"When have we ever lied?" LMAO.
Proper twelve commercials now...
why is dana so aggro
Sorry but Pena vs Nunes was fight of the night!
The *G.O.A.T.*
Get better mics.
I don’t think Dana white gives a shit
Man dana Lay of your Steroids,hes so Impotent he needs to talk shit all the time
Dana's face in the thumbnail 😂 Perfectly describes this card haha
screw LA Cali!! They will probably make the fighter wear mask during the fight!!! Vaccine Mandate, Mask Mandate! Freakin Liberals are WACK!
Been the best stretch of ufc cards in years. Given everything they’ve had to fight with Covid and what’s going on in the world it’s nothing short of amazing. When they sold the company people said the UFC’s best days were being them. That they basically saw that they did numbers with Conor and it was luck and time to get out. They’ve literally proved everyone wrong. Built guys up, being a fan of over 15 years the matchmaking is the best it’s ever been! Solute to the ufc and thank you for giving everyone an outlet during these crazy times.
Charles cheated ...and Herb Dean should be...fired!!
Just as soon as Peña got that partial Kimora anyone who knows fighting should have known she was still in it.
Dude...Dana is absolutely drunk.
9:28 Dana considers murder. 🤦‍♂️😂
Why do they keep feeding tomato cans to O’Malley? 🤣  That dudes record was 1-3 ffs!! At least give him someone who’s record is the opposite like 3-1 sheesh.  If Sean gets in the top 10, you watch. He’ll get smashed to bits, especially by Yan 🤣
Nunez doesn’t have a baby.
Got to thank them red states Texas and Florida for allowing us some ufc action during authoritarian lockdowns!!
Poor Dana, he definitley wants the opposite results in championship fights. When he put the belts he almost crying
I feel a Valentina vs Pena fight on the horizon!
During the toughest times during lockdown(s) UFC was pretty much the one constant every weekend and gave me something to get really excited about.  Its also one of the only sports that wasn't diluted by the lack of crowds.   Dana is a g
DANA! You adding Cody to the commentary crew now?
sold out to bad fighters don’t get sold out money
Charles no doubts Oliveira showed just why there's these hater's floating bout out there if it's not home-grown talent winning the shit talkers start with there bias veiws now after the poirier submission its time for ppl to move on and give Oliveira the credit he's due.
God these media fools just ask the same b*llshit over and over. Dumb questions.
14:00 min, herb two left feet dean is the worst ref ever. Illegal glove grab. Dana lied there.
This was the best fight card ever! the fights were crazy loved it
Sean o malley will be the biggest money maker for the ufc if he plays his cards right
Rematch for Nunes please
What can i say the only thing i beleive in this world is the UFC!
Uncle Dana!!!
They really should put captions for the Conor McGregor Proper Twelve commercials.
I don’t know what do UFC is going to do when Dana decides to retire
Outstanding event last night
Thanks D-Dub...
Feel bad for the person who chucked 320k on Amanda to win 😂
Thanks for the 200 bucks Do Bronx ❤️ ps “stay off the internet” lmao
Capping could also be exaggerating
"Dana, down to your right." Dana: *Looks to his left  😂😂
That was a hell of a card.. Would of been even better with conor on there.😆😆
Dana man! All sports CEO should run their business like this. Imagine if NFL and MLB Commissioners was like Dana. Their ratings would be back to normal instead of all this woke bullshit that are killing ratings.
I like that Dustin will never be champion. Isn’t champ material
How many of you thought you had a text message? You would think that person would have had their phone on silent
Who is this guy who always asks the first questions at every press conference??
Dustin lost me some damn money tonight when he should have won that shit!!!!
If the ufc only did shows in like 4 places it would actually create a huge demand and make it an event you have to travel to see. Actually wouldn’t mind it.
if izzy refuses to fight rob it’s because he’s avoiding him. who tf else would contend for that belt rn? rob has looked like a whole different beast in 3 victories since their first fight and it izzy is gonna just say no… hes obviously nervous
Dana always good for a laugh
Dana needs to grow a beard. Who is with me?
That's kinda crazy to me lol. My hometown highschool football team holds the same amount of people as an UFC fight lmao! 🤣🤣🤣But congrats to my boy O'Malley!!! 💪 🐐
Dana White is real life Wilson Fisk
Unsubscribed for the stupid proper 12 ad
Sad I don’t get to see Dustin as champ, love Charles, but we all know, once Islam gets the shot, he takes it. So I’m glad they’re holding him off and giving Justin a chancez
Adeysanya put out a Cap…. Hahaha. How old is that guy??!!  Have we ever lied…??  eh yes Dana you always do.. 😂😂
Nunes looked like she didn’t want to be there.
No one talking about the reaper wtf he deserves the next shot in
Shevchenko beats Peña and nunes if they fight again.
why do people say "I could care less?" It's I COULDNT CARE LESS. Even dana white has no fucking clue how to say that
That fair enough fair enough no neck having ass journalist is beyond irritating
Rip to that 300k blown on Amanda
Garbrandt's jaw is as fragile as Chuck liddells. Dude needs to hang it up, get an education and a career.
Its still a huge fight between Amanda Nunes and Kayla at 145 especially now everyone can see that Kayla can take her down and drown her in deep water. Before everyone was thinking maybe now they know it’s probably close to a 50/50 fight. Sadly the UFC will do the automatic rematch instead of making that fight at 145
this questions are stupid!
Karen asks a question about c0v1d, who would have thought.
Interviewer makes a living by taking gossip and spreading it as fact
Izzys childish millennial BS gets Dana offside real bad.
Dude that eye gouge was rough. Cut her
No, the ufc should stay away from California until they lift mandates… coming from a California resident
Great fight card. Exciting asl
Who pays for all these positive dana comments?
When he heals up we will see conor vs Dustin 4 because Conor will still want it.
I think that reporter was confused lol talking shit about Izzy
Who does audio for these press conferences? It’s atrocious every single one. Use some fold back monitors ring out the room and get rid of the feedback. It’s not that hard
“He put a cap out” most ate up shit I’ve probably ever heard in my life 😂
After that second round we’re Dustin didn’t do anything but hold Charles I knew it was over. Once he got his back Dustin knew it was a done deal. And still!
Dana wants him sit out until Conors is coming back in April,   It's Tony vs Conor that would be a super fight. The only Conor is doing is rematc.  Tony vs Conor
Charles deserves that money and that belt! Charles 10 year reign as champion!
Who's beating Charles? Unless Justin sends him to the underworld With a vicious uppercut  no one
Wow so many sheep reporters smh
He was definitely digging into them gloves super bad on several different occasions I believe that whole heart of these fucking cheating!!!!!
Izzy pissing the boss off lol.
Definitely biggest upset in history. Respect to julianna but she didn't look close to Amanda on that first round. I couldn't stop screaming
fucking Chiesa man…
Cody might have one more run left in him
Is Conor McGregor a bigger star. A more iconic star than GSP? Some would consider Conor the biggest star in UFC history. I like to debate on whether Mc Gregor vs Diaz 1 is the biggest upset or Michael vs George. I understand George's story and his immaculate skill. But I'm a Diaz fan so yeah. Im biased in this situation. idc lol
The fact that Peña told Dana white that she was gonna be a Champion in his Organization ,back when she was still a kid, is the stuff of movies….that’s awesome
Dustin had a cowlick and bags under his eyes. The immediate look of a loser. Every fighter who hits the ring lookin like they had a rough couple of nights, loses no cap.   Nunes was in mommy mode, knew she’d lose. Jan was in daddy mode, bye bye.   Pena sucks. She won with a jab and a neck crank. Against the “GWOAT”? Really? Against a woman who stood toe to toe with the real GWOAT, Shevchenko? You think she’d beat Shevchenko with a fucking jab? That was a scam. Nunes and her friends/family bet against Nunes and she vacated the belt to Pena. That was a surrender, NOT a fuckin loss. Nunes was smiling the whole time and didn’t give a FUCK she lost. She looked relieved.
I had Olivera since his last 2 wins.
Dana mad cause he knows the ufc hyped dustin to win that 😂🤣
Bruhhh the story about Chiesa at the end is hilarious 😂😂😂 man got faded and fell on his face, explains why he was so emotional too, homie was DRUNK
Brazil doesn’t deserve the UFC to go back. Bunch of dipshits down there with no respect for the non Brazilian fighters lol
Dana: I don’t want to see the Valentina vs Nunes Trilogy... Valentina: I will take the belt from Peña & if Amanda wants to be champ-champ she can come get this smoke!
Damn chiesa 😂😂
performance of the night Michael Chiesa ;)
His response to Adesanya is perfect too, who does give a shit lmao
70 percent of these questions are ridiculous.
I knew Cody was gonna lose, based off his last performance. Won my bet, lost what I won on DUSTIN DAMNIT, good for you Oliveira
Sean O'Malley definitely is a top guy. His only question mark is his leg durability. He'll go as far as that foot will let him
6 performance bonuses holy
Fucking love Dana, a UFC without Dana is 100000x worse than a UF without Conor, that's coming from a Conor fan!
lol@ proper # 12 whiskey promo.  Conor remains relevant. xD
Dude at 11:00 talks like a robot and it tripped me out.
I love how that's the gold standard now lmfao "the biggest non Conor McGregor gate ever"
cruz and peña definitely had the best performances
Amanda Nunes at -1000.  Who cashed in?
Olivera yes! UFC is back. I am so glad the UFC survived COVID-19. MLB survived the cardboard cutout phase. UFC was a trailblazer with the pandemic. Thank you, UFC. Good stuff.
Totally agree 💯 - all great fights tonight 🙏 thank you!!!!!
Dana being an extra prick  today, lol.
couldn't care less*
Dana's the Vince macman of UFC it's going to be lost without him
Nunez threw the fight -1100, takedown artist vs one of the worst takedown Defence pena, no takedown attempts seems suspicious
Here for 2the oliveira glove excuses 🍿🍿🍿
if all these fighters have shit loads of money... what does Dana have?
Dana White is Kingpin
Dana white is the man
knew oliveira had it when they both entered the octogon, he looked more loose than the diamond.
Dana the mma world owes you a huge thanks for this card. Every fight was fn bangers. Tuivasa did 23 shoeies before he made it in the back
Dana never heard Justin Gaethje say Olivera was a quitter?
UNCLE DANA NATHAN DIAZ HAS MADE YOU STACKS OF MONEY, PLEASE MAKE NATHAN VS OLIVERIA FOR NATHANS LAST FIGHT. HE TOLD ME HE WILL DEFEND IT WHEN HE WINS #209FORLIFE
The Yahoo sports guy is the worst media guy in MMA! He knows nothing! It's a disgrace to the sport to ask such meaningless questions!
Blue collar lmao olives straight outta the favellas
Stay off the internet "that's how I make a living sir"😂
Dana: the logical next step is Conor vs Olivera
Love the bluntness of Dana White but seriously with all your money maybe small investment for hearing aids.(at least for press conferences)
Glad i listened to chael by not listening to chael.. he was spot on when he said olivera had more ways to win but picked dustin 😂😂
I really hope SOMEBODY made a bet on Juliana Pena!
Nunes threw the fight. The submission wasn't even in before she tapped. She bet against herself and her family cashed in I guarantee.
That dude asking the questions in the beginning must be Dana's lost long son, took the first 5 mins of the videos asking complete nothing
2:56 Brazil is definitely a possibility if the UFC wants. Around 70% of our population is vaccinated, we have fans in other sports and many cultural events. Plz uncle Dana, make this fight in São Paulo, maybe even make it in the Corinthians stadium (that's a Charles dream and it's 15 minutes away from my home, so I would absolutely love it).
Dana’s mad Amanda lost lol
Dana: "yes I would have believed pena could win that fight."  Adesanya: 🧢
It felt like the conor khabib fight last night all you heard was USA USA while Dustin was abouta get submitted 🤣😭😭 put some respect on these real fighters
Dana "who gives a shit" White
Dana White knows first hand cvd lockdowns are bull...t!
Garbrant has always been a glass cannon he’s been on the wrong side of a few nasty KO’s before he even got into the big show
Bitch move by izzy
Nobody asked about Jones and ngannou or gane
It's so funny how Dana White Privilege always has to emphasize the idea that fighter pay is okay yet everybody complains about it.. he's so happy that they made as much money as they did tonight that he could just throw out bonus checks, imagine how much money they actually made??
It makes NO sense for Justin gatheje to be next contentender Dustin Poirier beat the sh*t out of him, and Oliveria beat the sh*t and submitted Dustin. Only makes sense Charles would easily beat Justin
Adesanya is living in Dana's head rent-free
It's "COULDN'T care less"... And THAT guy is a millionaire/spokesperson?!?!?
I'm so mad at myself for not betting on this card. My picks were literally all spot on, I could've parlayed and had enough money to buy christmas gifts 😂
Dana exposesing the Biden Admin and Fauci every UFC event they throw. 18 grand elbow to elbow and no masks. You support Biden your a dummy
You have to love how when it's Colby the racist Covington, who got his ASS BEAT, Dana White Privilege says he basically won the fight when he didn't, and that he's the "second toughest dude in the world" and all this other crap, but when it's Dustin "the Shark" Cerrone, he just says some regular stuff... Definitely doesn't call him the "second best guy in the world" or anything... And go figure, we all know Dustin is in a racist...
Chiesa, yikes 😬
they forgot to ask Dana about BAM BAM Shoey lol 🤣🤣🤣!!    gonna be easy work for Charles when he taps out Justin !!    I think the only dude that can beat Charles right now is ISLAM !!     Anderson Silva triangle choke on chael with secs left was badass !!!
I fucking hate how Amanda completely dominated two divisions, is still the FW champ, and John wants to know if she is ready to retire  I mean wtf is up with that??  Pena did amazing, but that is a fight Amanda can absolutely win in a rematch
Dana White is the most entertaining promoter in sports entertainment!
Dustin "The Shark" Cerrone!!!
So many talented strikers and boxers are tap machines!
16:06  This makes you wonder which Amanda Nunes showed up to the fight
Boxing waxes this bum sport
Great businessman but what a wanker!  So arrogant
Dana sounds winded.
Dana seems sad that Amanda Nunes lost
I fucking love Dana
Dana “I DONT GIVE A FUCK” White
Anyone else think that paper crunching was the reporters breaking into an applause?
Damn I never knew so many idiots have Dana's nuts in their mouth. Completely forgetting how he screws over his fighters over pay. Casuals lol hahahaha
Explaining to Dana what cap means hahaha
I'm on somebodys page from last week commenting he was winning with a standing guillotine in the 3rd..... Goddammit he choked him standing FROM THE WRONG SIDE!! Needed you to switch over and choke him from the front Charles I needed that money!!!
Pena needs 100k bonus for a KO on Amanda Nunes
16:29  How was the GWOAT fight not on his mind?  That Nunes - schevshenko matchup should be 1-1 and everyone knows it
Dana can’t stand that nunes lost. Period.
Charles oliveros accomplishment tonight shows that you can change. The heart and the determination and greatness is not something that is one time thing that you're judged on. Absolutely incredible. Honorable, God bless him
I remember when the UFC wasnt' about money. The fighters are better now that it is about money. It's sad.
Questions from the UFC press are getting worse every event.
Dana you’re the fuckin man! Thank you for never giving up on the sport even when you guys were millions in the hole, cuz this shit has paid off big time. UFC 117 was my first ever attended event, and ill keep watching till i die.
Feeling sorry for the arms on that suit jacket. They can’t take any more 😂
Every press conference people need to repeat themselves. Put a bluetooth on the desk
I can't fucking stand hearing Flabby Butt any more.
Nunes didn't take this fight seriously
Charles cheated. He illegally grabbed Dustin's gloves.
first android interviewer att 11mins and the other one sounds like hes got a mouthful of spit and a swollen tongue
Been saying this for years. Just when the world thinks someone’s sure to win there will be an upset
Holy $/:? These media questions suck.  Like a bunch of middle schoolers trying to instigate hate and discontent
Nunes threw that fight and bet against herself She carried Pena who looked terrible
🤣 Dana is so pissed Amanda lost.
John morgan: "I know it's still early, but did you talk to her about the future and everything she wishes to still  accomplish in life?"
Watching Amanda Nunes fight against Julianna Pena was reminiscent of watching Rhonda Rousey fight against Amanda Nunes.
Was Olivera suppose to be the guy to beat khabib 🤔 and if olivera beats Justin then fuck maybe he was
I'm afraid O'Malley has fragile legs! Athletes in every sport who has leg injuries seems to never get better! He sure is fun to watch when his ankles hold up?
Dana Pink “I’m gonna say this with out embarrassing the guy.” Proceeds to completely embarrass the guy. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
Real happy he’s gave out all those bonuses tonight. Seriously an amazing card top to bottom. The best goddamn card of the year
That Izzy question pissed Daddy Dana off 🤣😂
feel for Dustin, but Oliveira proves again..#1 brazil
Dana lost alot of money betting on nunes
Dana sounds like someone stole something from him he doesn’t give a f 😂
SANDHAGEN!!!
Every time I hear these Prese conferences it reminds me that these reporters are brain dead. Just the way they word questions is horrible.
lmaooooo ariel helwani chirps in with the  "it means ur lying in the millennial world"
Love Cody but he is done. He needs to take sometime off and heal.
Thank God for Dana White!!
Gaethje does not make sense
"you know nothing" XDD
I had Charles winning but man he will need some head movement going forward
This guy is so full of himself, but people are the ones who gave him that god mentality, he think he cannot be replaced, I think he can say whatever he wants because he’s done all white
The way people talked about Oliveira and by his body of work, I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that Julianna Pena would choke out Amanda Nunes
Dana at his best. Obviously made a shit load of Benjamin's from arena business and probably did insane ppv numbers
Yeah but she lost Dana. Stops trying to make fights before the fight takes place
So crazy to see Amanda lose that it was wild
most of these questions are horrible
What a amazing card to end the 2021 pay-per-view events. Hats off to all the fighters win or loss , except that eye gouging one. What a dirty dirty move !
Charles vs Justin now I hope Charles shuts Justin up
course john morgan asks all the easy questions and most of them regardless lol....if i was media id never let him get the mic first
Did Amanda lose on purpose?
14:49 "We're being invaded or something?!" -Dana White 😅😁🤣😂😆
Kayla vs nunes and schevchenko vs peña. Then nunes fights the winner of the 135 title fight
Dana lies, what I can't believe that how dare you insult this man.
I love this version of Dana
The end of the whole interview was the best part hahahaha. That idiot always makes me laugh.
Dana "I don't give a shit" White
Wow. Amanda kept getting hit by that stiff, and what looked like very avoidable  LEFT jab. Possible Kryptanite for Amanda?
😂😂to think I was called crazy for the last couple weeks for saying Charles and Juliana were gonna win lastnight😭😭😭😭
Cruz sucks he can’t ko anyone
Thank you king Dana....we don't deserve....👊🙏💯
Who gives a shit... And that tells you everything about what Dana really thinks about his champs.
Unfortunately Dustin poirier didn’t improve at all since losing to khabib in wrestling 👎 I had bet that fight will end 1,2 or third rounds. I knew that Dustin was not able to win
Cashed in on ever fight but the Neal one still did great even with that bullshit
Micheals a gas chap
Dana seems so pissed lmao
Highlight of the year .... Volkanovski v Ortega
"It means your lying in the millennial world- language..."  lmao the feels
John Morgan with the worst questions always
Danas ADD is hilarious in interviews, guys mind is all over the place
The media always asking the same questions when they already know the answers. Maybe 3 good questions overall. Its like they just asking questions to get air time
The Holm vs Rousey was the one I thought Dana would bring up regarding upsets. But,....that one stung for him. That was,...after all,....his cashcow.
Best business in history
Cruz vs O'Malley.
Olivera, Suga colby and Justin are the most exciting fighters right now
I would like to see Rob Font vs. O’Malley and Ki kara-France vs. Brandon Moreno.
Man I love Dana he keeps it real AF lol
What’s the difference between a lentil and a chickpea?  Nobody pays to have a lentil on them.
Proper 12 Wiskey sounds good.
Good year of cards.
Cruz show never be allowed on the main card he can’t ko anyone! Thank heavens I didn’t have to watch him fight
Good Lord!!!  When Dana said,..."it was the biggest NON-CONNOR MCGREGOR GATE EVER". 😳 WTF!!! He has a money gate named after him??? Dana is hilarious. The dude is the most transparent CEO in sports. Gets asked about a fight and whether its BS,....looks over to his underling to get real-time answer about contract signing.  Hilarious. Dudes a savage. And the fact he doesn't know what "cap" means is even more hilarious.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Herb Dean has been slacking in his referee job. Too many fence grabs and last nights fingers in the glove.  Really getting sloppy Herb. Maybe you need to go sit with Mario.
This ruined everything for McChicken as well. If Dustin won then it would be Connor v Poirier 4 but now Mcgregor has to actually work for it.
This "journalism" is completely shit, who are these guys.
What stood out most to me was how many levels above the whole division khabib was…. Man was on a whole different level
“Tough, durable, well rounded guy.”   The only compliment anyone gets from Dana not named Khabib/Conor.
What an idiot reporter you have to take tweets with a grain of salt this reporter almost single handedly about to ruin adesanya Whittaker rematch
Feels like Dustin got too excited, and gassed out lol. He has nothing left when Charles jumped his back.
It was so dope when cody was rocked and still baited france to swing on him then took him down, crazy. He could be a gatekeeper for a while
Who has their phone on, put it on vibrate!
I won some money last night. I took Kara France by 1 rd KO, Oliveira, Cruz, Taivasa, O'Malley.
Wonder how much they paid Nunes to take the DIVE. The betting odds were juicy for this to be a serious discussion
Dana handing out bonuse like candy makes u wonder on other nights how much he pockets for himself 😂😂
If you’re having a bad day remember someone lost 318k on Nunes last night
Dana is one of the most interesting and bad ass characters in the ufc lol
dana was very honest in this interview i love this !
Boxing is dead! MMA/UFC is king.  I’m wondering how many people were watching the Loma fight?? Didn’t even know he was fighting until this morning lol.
How the fuck does a cap mean you lied
Dana is a interesting cat.
Dana is a little Feisty tonight. Probably pissed Amanda lost because he was gonna do the Kayla Harrisson fight. I mean nunes is still 145lb champ and that's where Kayla would fight her but deff not as exciting anymore. Maybe if Amanda comes back and crushes Pena then it will be big again.
Sad for Cody
Amanda would of got eaten by the bullet in a 3rd fight
The man Amanda lost yay
Dana gassed walking up on stage lol.
Best hangover of 2021 this morning. What a nite for the under dogs!
I love how Olives BLATENTLY cheated super grossly by holding poriers glove to end up with that top position which completly changed the flow of the fight. But because he is a nice guy everyone including porier totally let it slide..... super weird.  kinda spoiled the win for me as an olives fan.
anyone catch @5:18 when dana slipped up and said higher contracts 😭
Non Conor McGregor haha, everyone knows who's the top dog
Always liked Dana white a straight shooter with some balls gotta love him!
"Who gives a sh*t" Hmm I think Robert would have some strong feelings about that
Cody is awful
Cody should retire now. Or maybe fight Dom one last time. Health is a gift that can’t be wrapped by wealth at the end of the day.
Always Open Florida Texas Apex
They exploited Amanda and that darn wife and baby every card she's on. Barely showing any other fighter's wives, but every time we see Amanda she's with hers. Well now she can go spend time with them and give us a break.
Question of durability and heart came nit from internet or news but from YOU'RE COMMENTARY
Crazy night! All those wins were amazing
“It was the biggest non Connor Mcgregor event at T-Mobile ever” Could you be more specific with that claim, Dana?
Dustin and Amanda both looked badly winded in the 1st round
Dana "Spend some time with his family" White.
Great Win By Charles Tonight   https://youtube.com/shorts/m0HegMt-Q94?feature=share
Dustin will never hold a legitimate belt
Amanda was checked out before the fight even started, that “baby” of hers ruined her goat status and she isn’t even related to the baby 😂 crazy......
Congrats pena, but I like to see Amanda fight that match again, I’m more shocked at this loss then the Anderson loss. Wow
Izzy still trolllin 🤣
I said it OLIVERA IS WAY BETTER THAN DUSTIN.
Amanda took a dive
Gaethje doesn't deserve the title shot over the Islam/Dariush winner
Hooking the glove during the omaplata attempt by Do Bronx was a veteran move, but also, changed the entire fight & momentum.
Can’t stand adensanya
the guy malley fought was a BUM
7:40 the reporters describing 🧢 to Dana is probably the funniest thing ever
Julianna beating Nunes is the highlight of the card for me.
Dana White is Awesome.
Amanda gets the next 5 rematches if she wants it
Lol Chiesa
I once saw a comment talking about Dana White smiling without his teeth. I can never un-see this.
NO DISRESPECT to Charles, but that glove hold either 2nd or 3rd rd (I don't remember) was pretty bad, it got him the position. He held Dustin's glove for a solid 20 seconds. Not saying it would of changed anything.. but that was the worst glove hold I've ever seen.

I swear I knew pena was going to win Amanda has been talking about stepping away and Peña was just way to confident. +630 dog won me some money last night
Dana sounds like he is still feeling the Covid lung.
Amanda talking all that shit know look at her she will never be the same after this lose
9:25 Iole shit talking dana...make the fight!
Dana the goat lol
Dana white is the real life Tony soprano. Always huffing and puffing and his bloated head lol
Rogan didn't want Oliveira winning, he was nearly crying 2nd round..
Highlight was Conner breaking his Little Irish leg.
Bucket load of bonuses and deserved! Amazing card. Contender for PPV of the year!
Oliveira is definitely the best grappler at 155 however I don't like how it took him grabbing Dustin's glove to change the tide of the fight
John Morgan stay your big body off the internet and that is not how you make your living you make your living by talking to athletes but obviously nobody wants to talk to you big Chin
Sign kayla
Oh Amanda
All Sports are Rigged Y'all seen Amanda give her the Choke right ?
Everybody acting like they knew Charles would win. Why was he the underdog then? I knew he’d win but you all doubted him.
Amazing fight card! Wow
Is it just me or does Dana have little man syndrome?
Charles smashes gaethje in 2
0:23 Dana…. Do…. You….  Need…. An…. Inhaler?
I knew Olivera would make it, amazing!
I wonder if Dustin's still crying 😢 but hey atleast he's got his wife to cry with 😘 diamonds are forever tapping bitches out 😉
What does Dana mean when he said they broke the highest of all time PPV. The highest if I am not mistaken is Khabib vs McGregor and that got 2.4 M PPV. As far as I know nothing got close to that so far
I want to see Dom versus O’Malley
Got to love Dana, refreshing have a business man just say what he means
That Amanda fight was flat out rigged
Dustin didn't show up, Period! That was not the same Dustin we've seen in last couple of fights. Not saying it wouldn't of ended the same but that was not a prepared Dustin. He looked gassed after the first half of the first round.
Cody “No Chin” Garbrandt!!!
Amanda can NOT be trusted again after last night . And she is NOT what people thought she was one: how disappointing. She was a -1000 favorite for a reason . Fought like an amateur out there, wreckless abandonment. Should have been the easiest money ever Sean and Amanda in a parlay. Amanda I hate you
Dustin moves to 170 and gets that nate diaz fight lets go lol.
No fight is as bad as Serra GSP.... Matt Serra wasn't even a proper UFC fighter, he came from ultimate fighter and won the shot from some weird idea they had...  Pena was the title contender
How about the fact Charles used Dustin's glove the way he did!?!? Talk about bs! Dude was like" I win no matter what, me need to prove me people". He's good but he cheated a couple times
Charles will smoke 💨 all thm boys!!
Is this really Dana? This man changes every fight he looks soooooooo much different! Over the years his voice has drastically changed, his head and face is bigger his hands are bigger, wtf is he taking!? Does hgh make you keep growing?
Dana be on Demon Time at the post fight press conferences💀😂
how comes nobody talks about amanda nunes loss, its like saying all the shes the greatest, then she loses and nobody even talks about it
"How can I say this without embarrassing him"..."he's a drunk that fell in his face and was taken out by the police" hahaha! Dana ya gotta love him!
Tell me why I had a feeling nunes was going to lose for some reason
Dana, thank you for holding the line for personal freedoms and not pulling punches regarding the absurdity taking place
Fuck yeah! FL TX, Abu Dabi!! Who’d have thought you’d have more freedom in eastern Arabia than the United States!!!!
Dana's pretty nice to the people he calls the biggest pussies in the world.
I mean how can’t this be your favorite sport?? Lol so good
Better Pena won… it was hard to market a Butch Lesbian
Love watching alpha Dana dispatch his snowflake, libtard press core.   Funny how the most manly sport has the least manly press covering it.
Dana def happy Dustin lost
The difference between a UFC event and a boxing event is incomparable. This was great from top to bottom
Cody “outcold rockhold” Garbrandt
I like Mr. Whites’ honesty. Everyone should have this quality.
Every sport is rigged some. That being said the only thing I see rigged about the ufc is a few select judges and that’s bc Dana can’t select the judges the states do. It’s refreshing having real competition.
DELUSIONAL DANSA about OMALLY till now didnt fought noone ., no names!!!
Chael “Botox” Sonnen
Micheal chandler vs Dustin
Dana's no fucks given attitude is one of the secret recipe that makes UFC so popular 🔥😂
Reporter: chiesa got into a scuffle? Dana: ya with himself apparently
Dominic Cruz was a great fight too. What a comeback.
I have better judgment then those retired ufc fighter judging of the fight who's gonna win..I was sure of winning the fight between Oliveira vs Dustin.i was sure Oliveira will submit Dustin exactly it goes the way I predict 😉.
These older journalists trying to describe the 🧢 reply from Adesanya and twisting it completely out of context 🤣 Made Dana hate Israel now 🤦‍♂️
Julianna not getting bonus nor credit  in this interview was wild. She just defeated one of the most dominant fighters in ufc history.
Dana- “They’re both blue collar guys who grinded their way to the top”  Chandler- “are my work boots a joke to you?”
Journalists should do their job properly before they ask Dana stupid questions.
Cody is going to get cut.
I should’ve bet on Pena
kayla harrison would beat the crap out of nunes
Dana is insane dude, he perfected this craft over the pandemic and he doesn’t need anyone but himself to get this shit done
Oliveira > Khabib
I love how they have to say “he’s a real guy” after every single O’Malley fight …. Guys a fuckn clown he ain’t built for top tier .
Poor Bobby knuckles, deserves that title fight tf
Dana runs for president he definitely wins Texas, Florida, Apex (nevada) lmao
Dana looks ill. His eyes are dark and he looks flushed and unshaven.  I heard he had covid recently and it looks like he took a beating from it. I say he will retire soon, maybe next year.
13.50 = john morgan opening a pack of doritoes
There was no glove grab... clearer on review
Lmao the explanation of a 🧢
Chiesa is easily the most cringe ufc employee
Did anyone notice how easy pena took Amanda's back?? How it looked like nunes said here take my title some fake shit
“If you don’t believe in God, follow my story” - Charles Oliveira
dana paying out 250k in bonuses like it’s a big deal
Pena is the first person to punch Amanda in the face and hard. Over and over again. That jab was brilliant. I’m a boxer and I have always watched UFC fighters not use a well rounded jab to set up stand up game. It’s the most important strike in stand up fighting and Pena proved a stiff jab is what you need to back up and set up the destruction of your opponent. That jab busted Nunez up. Perfectly timed over and over again as Nunez jumped in ,she got that jab in the nose. That rocked her. And that changed her whole mindset to holy shit , ,bells ringing and pain. Love that kid. And that jab. That control of her arm was brilliant too.
Was there a robot asking questions today wtf
Great job Dana!  Keep fighting the good fight!  Thanks!
If Izzy refuses to fight Rob he should be stripped
Haha I was listening with head phones and when Dana or John phone went off for messenger I was like 😳omg did someone message me 😔nope 😂🤣
Dana's face when he said "we're all good" was not the face of a man who is all good
"You gotta stay off the internet more" "Its where I make my living sir" Lol both honest and fair statements
O'Malley needs to stop fighting cans tho and fight someone in the top 10. Can't protect him forever
It's crazy I legit never bought a UFC ppv yet hasn't missed one in at least 3 years
"he put a cap out, meaning a lie"-- who tf says this
Glad Omally won
Ronda Rousey can beat Pena.
“How do I say this without embarrassing this guy?”   Proceeds to embarrass this guy.
Ufc has the worst reporters. These dudes ask the dumbest questions.
One of the best UFC events I’ve ever seen.
I've been telling people about Charlie Olives since he beat up big mouth Kevin Lee. He is the one of one in the ufc lightweight division. The only thing is he's gotta move his head off the center line when he gets in there with Gaethje
Every excuse is used for Amanda. She got her ass beat and that’s that their is nothing more to it… no factor in life can take that away from Peña she deserves it and that’s all there is
If you smashed all the records this year Dana you need to be paying the fighters more then !
God I love Dana
To me Nunes didn't look the same as her past. Nunes had her in the 1st all she had to do is ground and pound! PO'ME COLORBLIND
I don’t get why it’s taking so long for Sugar to get a fight with the top guys. I love Sugar he goes there to knock people out and not let the judges decide. Plus so many of his fights seem so one sided
Dana not sober tonight
Some of these questions are so dumb.
These questions are terrible…
Hahaha Dana is brilliant 👏  he doesn't have any fuckin about hahaha
8:43 wow Dana covering for his golden Goose “oh you don’t want to fight top contender? Okay we’ll keep protecting you”
This is why old guys should stay out of young peoples business 😂. Adesanya is prolly saying Whitaker didn’t sign or they are pulling out. Dana took it all personal. The point is IT is a lie, not that UFC is lying.
We don’t lie about fights 😂 dc vs brock?
I don't think he was talking about Dana White lying I think he was talking about Whittaker
Amanda has a baby now?  Aww he got someone pregnant… good for him.
Wash your f king ears out Dana !
Chael sonnen sucks at picking period.
Juliana wanted it more
Best thumbnail ever
Some of these questions are just dumb as fuck not gonna lie
Last thing for me after asking all the fucking questions! 😒😒😒
I genuinely look for this dudes post fight press conference.
Chandler vs Dustin - gaethje vs Charles - Islam vs mcgregor 👀
Dana was “Annoyed Dana” in this post conference.
Mentions two of the best states in the country, RED Republican states that don't kowtow to corrupt communist Democrats. Shout out to Florida and Texas.
Dana white: this is the best year in the company's history. Also dana: its covid,  how do you expect me to pay fighters more 🤔
Cardano to the moon
Dana needs to take a step back and give someone eles the rains he his out of breath sitting on his arse hows that possible 😂😂FP
First reporter really asked a question regarding oliveira heart is so clueless🤦🏽‍♂️
Izzys in Trouble 😂
Losing was probably good for Poirier , now he can fight Connor a 3rd time and collect the 💰💰
Poor Dana is losing his hearing
Proper no. 12 Irish whiskey
"How do I say this without emberrasing this guy" goes out to embarrass the guy.
The guys asking questions are asking like 5th grade level questions, no insight what so ever lol. Congrats to all the amazing fighters!!
14:04 Dustin was digging his fingers in his own glove.
All those bonuses.. Merry Christmas everybody haha!
It’s almost like Triad Combat inspired UFC pay more to the fighters.
no more tequila ads for chiesa i guess :p
Dana NEVER underperforms. Fantastic looking suit also. Love me some uncle Dana
The only problem i have with ufc is to stop showing lesbians.
Let the man finish his fucking answers before chirping in with your questions, actually unbearable
Dana is so good at what he does.... It's amazing. The UFC is on such an upswing, it's incredible.
Ige cost me money smh
Nunes tapping out like that 🤔 looked fixed
Oliviera is a dirty fighter and a cheat
Whoever asked Dana about Izzy needs to grow a backbone jesus christ
God the reporters were asking some of the dumbest cringiest questions wtf was up with them this press conference
ufc ruining my sleep schedule for the last decade, but fights so good
Dana the goat
Dana seems cheesed off. I don't think he was expecting Amanda and Dustin to lose - which ultimately will cost him a few quid.
Who gives a shit...Dana the honest savage🤣🤣🇮🇪
Easy money betting on olivera🏄‍♂️ these strikers dont have a chance against him
These older people misusing “cap” is so fun to watch “threw a huge cap out”?🤣 so funny
Respect to everybody on this card… but we were just here for the sugar show
Dana looks like shit after covid and getting super good care and still says he doesn’t give a shit if anything opens up  lol
Omg did Nunes loose? I guess i better start paying attention again.
Us mma fans are so spoilt now.
Charles has to learn how to take less damage. If he learns how to not put himself at risk he will reign as champion for a long time. Too many weapons.   Justin has learned how not to take damage which makes him dangerous.   If Charles hasn't learned this by his fight with Justin then we will have a new champ. If he makes the adjustment then we will hear “and still” once again.
Kingdom!!! Jidding about Cruz being fight of the night!  He looked wasted
Dana getting winded reading those names 🤣🤣🤣 lay off the lobsters guy!
The days of the stand up striker as champ are over u haft to be just as good if not better on the ground
"you don't want the Whittaker fight? alright, give you something else, WHO GIVES A SHIT!?"  Whittaker choking on his cereal...
I wouldn't take the UFC to any Liberal Shit Hole! Fk LA!
Boss man
Cody's chins gone..... He needs a very big layoff
Drunk as hell lmao
She has a baby now, she so worried abut being a dad she lost that belt lolol
So glad I bet on my man Olivera
Why is no one talking about olivera grabbing poriers gloves in the 2nd round??
Oliveira vs Gaejthe summer 2022 ( let the champ rest)
"Propour twulfe!"
How can you not love Dana's post fight conference's..
Never seen Dana more tickled pink in my life. Awesome scenes for combat sports.
Poirer vs MacGregor 3 1/2
I wanted to see charles oliveira vs khabib so bad...i am so curious how charles would handle khabibs graple to the cage :(
Dana Luther is a straight G. This dude is one of the coolest dudes in front of the camera and off.
Shevchenko looking at that bantamweight title like a snack
UFC's Dana's wife i say ❤️
Dana says loves to say people have a shit ton of money. Last person he said that about has went on hiatus because she wants to make more money. Stop it bro   The worst mistake was calling Nunes the GOAT  And what ranking did O Malley get from a non ranking opponent. Stop hyping a guy fighting trash cans.
UFC showing the tyrants they will not be able to destroy all of our fun...
Dana was not in a good mood tonight. Probably because of Amanda. I know their relationship is more than business casual. I'm sure that he considers her and Nina  friends.
How happy Amanda was to loose. Too muihc pressure with the belt. She seemed happy to have got rid of the belt for now.
cody is done, I think.  5/6 losses last fights.  Time to retire.
Kai Kara-France: "i'm not fighting again until I get a title shot" Dana: "K"
I knew Julianna was going to beat Amanda. I'm glad the bookie had her at 6/1 underdog, I put money on her to win and it paid big time!
Dana merged bam bams first and last name 😂😂
John morgan is cringe 😬
COULDN’T CARE LESS
I thought dustin was the one glove grabbing
had dustin trained the ground and cardio instead of commercials he would be champ now ✌🏼❤️
Izzy told us that he spars with Kai and that Kai is a BANGER, sharp that Izzy.       City Kick Boxing, the Home of the feints.       Who the Fook was that at the end plugging Proper 12!?
Funny how omalleys prelim was fight of the night dom cruz v omalley
Just lost $1000 as i had put it on a multi bet at 2.6 odds if SugaSean and Poirer both had won I would be around $1400 richer but now i just lost the rent money i put in this bet, overconfidently thinking Poirer will smash Olievers for sure😭💔😞
Alright O'Malley going to get payed.
It's sad to see the Cody is the next champion to be released from the ufc and he's still in his prime years minus the prime part I think his chin is fragile after that to loss
That’s how I make my living sir I listen and repeat lies
Dana is a legend.composed thoughtful.the reason why ufc is the best and will be until he gives it away
Is it just me or is mma media having a crack at ckb. What the fuck lads stop starting shit with the boss and ckb team.
After years of watching these post-fight pressers w Dana, I gotta ask, why tf do they still have them lol? He never knows shit and gets pissed off by most of the questions lol
Some of the results tonight is a testament to why the ufc has surpassed boxing promotions from top to bottom of the card youve got fights where genuinely anything can happen of course there’s exceptions but for the most part the matchmakers just get it bang on
6:42 this is why Dana is irreplaceable
Oliveira was 100% digging into Dustin's gloves.  Everyone watching it saw that..   Did it to Tony also
How about "I couldn't care less".
A reminder that Chael picked Peña to win. The GOAT
Christ these reporters keep asking the stupidest fucking questions. Like it seems like they come up with the dumbest possible questions to piss off Dana lol.
I Love it when Dana calls a Spade a Spade...and backs up and calls it again
"He said hes not fighting again until he gets a title shot?...okay" I love Dana 🤣
She is not the GOAT like ive been saying all along shes been fighting cans which is why she didnt wanna rematch Valentina who beat Pena sooooooo
You said Rose was scared to fight Zhang the first time .... LIE !
8:49 “When have we ever fucking lied?”  Ummm 🤔
7:34 dude that guy is trying too hard. "He put a cap out"
That’s how I make my living sir.  👌👌❤️ you tell em.
@3:09 - ‘I could care less’  Winds me up the way Americans say this.   It’s ‘I couldn’t care less’  If you could care less, that means you care somewhat about it.  If you couldn’t care less, which is the correct saying, it means you literally couldn’t care any less about that thing.
Dana, if your gonna call other promoters names, please know if your Middleweight champ is signed to a fight or not
You got to stay of the internet... "that's how i make my living sur" sounds like a you problem buddy
Who gives a shit hate this dude sometimes
Lol I won so much money tonight betting holy fuck.. I love you Dana lol
2021 was the best year in UFC history imo
Charles deserves that belt 💯
Should everyone be suprised that Charles won we all know Dustin porier has weak ground game and Charles do Bronx olivera is more than capable of KHABIBing Dustin into a choke KHABIB did the same thing tired Dustin out then it was smash time until he got his back
I need to become an MMA "journalist" Jesus Christ these guys are bad at their job.
We all wanna see Conor vs Charles next!
Dana "What's That Dipshits Name" White
You would think Dana has beat up many guys how his attitude comes off... Can't show me one guy he has beat up... Bro is a punk look how he acts tuff talking
Dana is such a shit promotor its hilarious 🤣, half deaf, can't answer questions, forgets everything.  Man is lucky he has a monopoly on the sport 🤣
"Does anyone else think that Johnny Hendricks won that fight" -Dana White
Dana white for potus
Peña keeps shocking people
Dana’s frustrated…lost alot of money tonight🤣😂
Could we possibly see more ring girl time please 😉😉 Merry Christmas to you all
Connor better stay away from Charles at all costs, Connor loves to tap and Charles loves to make you tap
Steroids must be effecting his hearing
Actually picked that pena Rnc finish
While tourists come to Nevada to gamble and experience Las Vegas, residents pay no personal income tax, and the state offers no corporate tax, no franchise tax, and no inventory tax. Beautiful Dana only host fights in states with no or low income tax beautiful Dana f****** beautiful
You know what's mad? That Cruz has came from the WEC as champ, into the UFC, became bantamweight champ, had  3 years of injuries, came back, fought the young up and comer in Cody Garbrandt, left for a year, came back, and he probably has less miles on the clock than Cody... It really is such a shame, Cody was such a talent but those TJ fights just utterly destroyed his durability.
Lied plenty of times making a fight lol
Cody KO
Dana is the true Champ 🏆
Adesanya and Dana beef sounds fun to me
Pay my man suga NOW
I like how the reporters have good rapport with Dana they speak to him the same way he speaks to them beautiful
“Dustin was never my friend”~Dana white
Cody needs to retire.
4 Man Tournament Nate vs Dustin & Conor vs Tony
13:03 sounds like a granny
Glad to hear that, dana really isn't a greedy person, if they deserve something they get it. And I like that
Dana is getting old
Omalley didn’t fight anyone still.
Why is he out of breathe from just reading ? ...lol
His responses here imply he is seriously annoyed that Pena won. They clearly lost a lot of money on the Nunes and Harrison.
Stay closed and miss business. Fuck of Dana cares. Life and business moves on.
Dana White is the G.O.A.T he's the real star. That's one reason more I love UFC.
Kai Kara-France finally got some respect on his name. I love Garbrandt, but he's a natural Bantamweight. Same shit happened to Dillashaw.
Kai for title shot
I've realised how important the psychology of Dana always talking about how good things are and how great the gate and ppvs are, how great the fights are... Will be what any new interested fan will hear and it is basically a great marketing tool
olivera for illigal glove holding = dana "give this guy a bonus"
How did people forget Holm-Ronda?  Anyway, great card
Shout out to the guy who lost 300k betting on Nunes
Chiesa lost to the booze and floor tonight. Tough.
It's funny I look more forward too Dana's posts fight interviews than the fighter's themselves.
The way Dana asked Hunter the second time about the izzy fight... You know that was a "oh shit" moment backstage
The person that bet over $300,000 on Amanda is on suicide watch
Blue collar china controlled guys wtf @Dana White THIS IS AMMA pay our fighters we love stop being a Don King and give your Athletes what they ...
Cody's getting cut.
Adesanya may have it in writing..but what about whittaker?? That shouldve been the next question
Some of these questions are stupid
"PROPER NO. 12    Idish whiskey".
Amanda was mad, frustrated and angry at Juliana you could tell nunes is used to bitches feeling that power and taking a nap on the canvas but Juliana said nah fam I want that strap. Amanda just lost her shit man she’s still the better fighter
Dustin. Not 1 kick.  Wtf.   Boxing
Nunes wants to steer clear of a Kayla Harrison fight, Harrison would absolutely rag doll her.
So dustin is a gate keeper now?
Why the fat guy ,always go first with questions? So he dont run out of breath?
Dana is having a hard time tonight...
I don't want to hear yall talk about no damn female goat nomore it's valentina it always has been
Fck any State that isn't open yet.
Just a hunch… but it doesn’t seem like Dana gives a shit.
That man has a vibe that makes you want to slap him
Dana: I dont give a fuck  also Dana: 9:22
Have to explain the cap avatar 🤣🤣🤣
Oliveira would have been Khabibs toughest fight. Change my mind P.s not saying oliveira beats him just saying style wise Charles has the tools
man the amazing fights ufc has pulled of this year nothing short of incredible.
Michael Chiesa probably cut hisself during the conor mcgregor dolley incident then sued
Somebody talking about cheisa mother again lol" Don't talk about my mom".  I can see why Dana gets upset they ask him the same damn questions over and over again 🤣
Dana is the goat
I love how proper 12 keeps popping up after the dustin fight lol
I can't stand the narratives these journalists try to make up and the way they reference f%cking twitter, its BS
Dana starting to look like a DC mob boss
Juliana Pena Wow WARIOR!
Damn, Santa Dana giving up 7 bonuses for this card 🎅  That's awesome!
The mac life is geigh..
I said this before too Poirier isnt championship material... Hes just a journeyman... And he knows he cant coz he doesnt believe in himself... He is his own enemy
What happened to Cody lol, dude was killing everyone and now gets killed by everyone 🧐🧐
That Pena fight was crazy shit
Dana killed Chiesa 😭
13:55 - John Morgan opens up a bag of chips.
Non Conor McGregor gate.... lol
Can somebody get dana a hearing aid for xmas.
The Michael Chiesa story was the funniest shit I ever heard 🤣
i love dana so much man 😂😂
8 fold bet lost it to fucking geoffery beating ponzimcdoodle. Fuck me
Dustin "Don't let this loss distract you from the fact that I love my daughter" Poirier
This dork media guy at 8 minutes is the worst.
i think Dana needs an inhaler.
Now you know why Kayla was saying FCK!!! After Amanda's loss. UFC won't take her now probably and that sucks ass
Charles wasn't exactly blue collar before the UFC. Buddy was living in the favela.
When has the "UFC" ever lied? Was Dana referring to misinformation to protect the organization, athletes brand can not be bigger than the ufc.
You get a Bonus! You get a Bonus! You get a Bonus!...
Dana is the only executive in any sport in the world who is just as much as a loved superstar as his athletes.
McDouble with his brown nosing at every chance he gets. He does many even ask good questions
Valentina going to be double champ
“COULDN’T” care less Dana! 🙄
Dana n Connor on the same Juice 🧃
Dana "we being invaded or something?" White
Khabib vs oliveira would be so litt right now🔥🥰🙏
Dana breathing heavy after Covid..
Don’t jump on Du Bronx nuts now fucking cowards
Missed you Dana
“ The biggest non Connor mcgregor gate”  let that sink in 😂😂😂
Dasna actually said Pena might win.
DANA LOST SOME SERIOUS MONEY TONIGHT!
TJ Dillashaw ruined Garbrants career lol
They gotta rename performance/fight "of the night"
🧢..... Lol.😂
Dana is the goat man
it's called an emoji.  Not an avatar.
Why is Dana so funny lmao
I turned my last 50 cents into 6$ lol olives picked the round
Omaley the clown
Not “giving out some money” they all earned it and much more
Nunes through the fight!
Did the guys asking the last question not listen to the press conference?
PROPER 12 IS GARBAGE
Dana just giving out that holiday bonus tonight 💰💸💰
Bing bong O’Malley by KO
The guy he beat tonight was a real guy - reality, didn't press him once
Dana's looking like Kingpins smaller brother.
Dana is the boss of all men.
The guy who asked the Adesanya question is a pos. He likes stirring the shii.
I won big money on Charles last night also bet on cody to lose. Man todays going to be good!
Dana has done a good job managing the UFC during the final moments of the World's existence. He's going to have to find a way to get out of his deal with the Devil if he wants to get to heaven though. Maybe he will be saved during the tribulation when all his riches will be taken from him, and he realises his pursuit of worldly success is a vain pursuit. Turn to Jesus before it is too late.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AuP8EpeDo8
Bro Olivera totally grabbed Dustin’s glove and gained an advantages position like that. Total controversy in my book. Olivera got top position and pummeled the shit outta Dustin, all predicted from that foul! And herb Dean just let it happen!   It really mars the fight, Dustin wasn’t the same afterwards
Charles vs Gaethje; Dustin vs Islam next
After Carles has beat porrier, i dont want see carles v gaethje. I think darius or islam should fight carles next.
Dana is right. First question guy needs to stay off the internet. Dana meant stop reading elementary gossip clickbait statements "on the internet" then formulating your questions around those internet garbage statements. First question guy needs to ask better questions.
Cut Cody Garbrant
Best commish in the game and it’s not even close
Dana was in rare form tonight! lol he seemed pissy for sure!
Justin will lose to. Only khabib can beat this kid.
Jorge Prado   I haven't seen a bought out fight in a long time and I never thought UFC would change to a fraud.   1. Amanda won the first round clean and wasn't hurt. 2. Amanda tried so hard to get hurt. 3. The ref called the fight over in less than 2 seconds. (Worst ref ever/& out of all the fights refs could of stopped, he stopped this one LMAOOOOOOOOOO) 7. Amanda was so happy she lost??? Never have seen that before. At least try to sell it.  5. How much did you pay Amanda to lose? and how much did you guys make?   I lost so much respect for UFC. Fuckinggg politics chose money over judges.
I think Charles started using since late 2019
Keep making fun of Juliana
Why Morgan get to ask first all the time
Boss
Release Cody now surely😂😂😂
The Prelim card was better than most Fight Night main cards
Incredible event every fight was good
looked like nunes didnt give af
UFC IS FIXSD
Who else thought the amanda fight looked fixed. I mean She kod freaking cyborg and Holm  and couldnt even stand with Juliana who is a grappler. Very weird
Dana is awesome!!!! So real!!
Nate and Conor was the biggest upset.
Cody's career has no love for itself
But Kayla is 145 right? And Nunes still has the belt on 145? What’s the problem then for a fight ?
I hope all the sleepers wake up to Charles now, dude is world class.
i actually cant believe that amanda nunes was the fight that fucked up a 6 fight parlay lol id be less mad if it wasnt her but jesus christ
I Made lot of money from Amanda vs Juliana 👍👍
Proper No. Twelve is the shittiest Irish whiskey ever existed
Dana is so damn high t in these interviews recently big hog boss
Look how happy Danna looks when he’s talking about Suga, he knows the star power he brings and he knows he’ll make that money back too
I bet you olivera got a case of proper 12 coming his way 😂🤫😂
Couldn’t care less
He look like thanos
Amanda already loss to the bullet..come on
Is it jus me r does anyone think Dana is high as h*ll right here. WOW HE IS  BLASTED.  Dana on some of that space ship shit. Lol
Dana white is such an over emotional aggressive clown
Massive card fkn mean 2 watch 🔥
SUGA SQUAD NFT 🚀📈 what a fuckin card tonight we got ladies and gentlemen.
Great card! 🔥🔥🔥
Not the reporter explaining what cap means to Dana White 😭
Dana completely embarrassed Michael Chiesa after saying he wouldn't 😂😂😂😂
Dana white is a amazing boss.
6:35 is what you wanted to hear.
Prediction for Gaethje vs Oliveira: Oliveira has had success against opponents with serious experience in wrestling with the likes of Michael Chandler (TKO), Tony Ferguson (D), Kevin Lee (S), Jim Miller (S), Clay Guida (S) and Jeremy Stephens (D) with Oliveira actually submitting, outpacing a majority of them. However, I expect Justin Gaethje to beat Oliveira by KO in the 2nd round.
Vegas made their millions off that Nunes sell job. Dana was that bettor of 330,000$
Dana white had a couple howler head whiskey shots tonight. Feelsgoodman
Dustin vs Colby at 170 next
Where the casuals who kept saying he will quit
Amanda NO HEART Nunes... she quit and looks like she is tired of fighting
Dana sometimes reminds me of Chris Farley
Is Dana drunk or honest?
Dana's fingers look like a can of Vienna Sausages
Amanda should be investigated for throwing the fight
I love UFC. Dana is the man 🇫🇯🇫🇯🇫🇯🇫🇯🇫🇯🇫🇯🇫🇯🇫🇯
Considering the world & what's going on the UFC has smashed it. Have given us banger after banger card. Very appreciative of them! Well deserved Christmas break upcoming
This card gets a 10/10
Dana is drunk lol
Honestly if Charles beats Justin and Islam he's going to be right there in Khabib status.
Adesanya said "cap" about Whittaker posing that he will get his belt back ... Rookie reporter
Kai getting that money. Leshgoooo brother
I wonder what would’ve happened if Dustin had took the Olivera fight instead of the money fight.
These reporter questions,,,  sheeesh
Cody gonna be nothing more than a stepping stone if he stays fighting. Damn that was a rough loss for him.
Charley was getting out box until he chose to wrap his legs around another grown man , and hips by his ass then slipped in his hands around Dustin’s neck. Fuck charley but aye good win not a fan really
Izzy doesn't want to give Bobby another chance, got him coming off the injury layoff fighting like an idiot, Bobby has looked amazing since and no one else deserves a shot, Brunson is probably the only other guy on a run at that weight.
lol Izzy
*Holy shit Juliana!!!!!!!* 😘
Dana writing hella checks 💵💵💵💵
I'm kind of confused, was Nunes ever a true star? I'm thinking the metrics would say no.
Biggest none Connor Mcgregor  gate🤣🤣🤣Mcgregor is boss
Dana is almost unrecognizable from 15 yrs ago....years of steroids..
Haha, looks like some kids are getting sent to Principle White's office.
I think Julianna Pena vs Kayla Harris is just as big a fight
I don't think O'Malleys performance is great.
All the olivera haters can have a cry now
Love it Dana. Glad you are healthy as expected. Missed you on Tuesday nights ow that is is the offseason, but content with Saturday night.
Vettori Whittaker it is
O'Malley and Bam Bam with the good hands. Great card!
Its beyond me how pena doesnt win fight of the night
Just kidding I love this Man
That women's fight sucked lmao idk if they were low ranked or what. But Jesus somebody needed to teach them how to throw a punch.
I love Dana but also hat him but we are blessed to have him
My boy No Love's career is tragic!
I knew without a shadow of a doubt after watching Chael describe every advantage Oliveira had and how Oliveira had more ways to win and that he was still picking Dustin, I knew Charles had this in 3 rounds or less.
Damn this is the most generous him and the UFC have ever been I think.  It's gotta set a new record night for bonuses.    6 POTN and 8 bonuses total!
Performance of the Night goes to John Morgan for his demolition of his Wendys double
Tidak kuat melihat orang yang dijadikan panutan harus kalah. Tetap semangat untuk Poirier 🏃🏃  Selamat untuk Charles 🏆👍
Hey Whitey Bulger!! About the MAGA MILLION  DOLLAR FIGHT? AMANDA? IF? IF WAS A FIFTH? WE WOULD ALL BE DRUNK BIG GUY..🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃
Time stamp for when he talks about adesanya ?
Imagine it comes out that Nunes and her family bet against her to get a huge payday and she retires 😬
My buddy was one round off winning 1100 dollars off a 15 dolla bet I was as shocked as Peña looked when she won congrats to her doing the seeming impossible
Thanks Dana
Man, Dana is just the boss.
really closed the year strong Dana 🔥 thank you for your service and let’s bang again 2022❗️
Dustin's gonna move up to 170 to fight Nate for that big money fight watch .
Somebody bet $318,000 to win $25,000 on Amanda...that somebody was Dana White. Look how pissed he is🤣🤣🤣
Oliver's was digging his hands in his gloves though I was like wow the ref isn't doing nothing about that.
O'Malley hasn't fought a real guy yet.  When he did he broke his leg.
Dana’s the best CEO in sports… it’s not even close!
Lioness... no hand fighting. No hooks in. Tapped faster than McGregor. Did she bet big $$$ on herself???
Dustin lost. Conor is still the king at 155.
" have we ever lied "
I think Dana did a couple "shoeys" with Tai...
Is it just me or does dana look exhausted? The bags under his eyes, he should get some sleep ... guess that why hes so succesful .... sleeps for the weak
Title sounds like your calling O’Malley a dipsh!t
Love how much Dana cracks up the journalists
Was the underdogs nights tonight baby !!
Damn Dana, abusing Adesenya. Big mistake on Izzy’s part
Dana needs some hearing aids lol
Dana White will be missed...
Thanks Dana for your magnanimous efforts in 2020 and 2021 by giving us best the UFC fights in this Covid lockdown situation and helping us get entertained when everything else was shut.💖 I know one day you'll retire and I'm also sure that UFC won't be the same after you're gone.
Dana is on suicide watch. Nunes lost
Awesome night, enjoyed the card.
Who the fuck said Olivera doesn’t have heart? One person? Now it’s being asked in every interview and press conference? So fuckin dumb
What a crazy night of fights, enjoy your night people
WA State stand up🔥 The girl from Spokane defeated the GOAT
Was one of the best events I've seen in a long long time not because of one fight but because of all of the fights that's rare lol most if these huge cards end up being underwhelming this one lived pass the hype haha
Charles is King. He just knew he was gonna win. Went to area of advantage and destroyed DP
Amanda fought like rousey im not surprised she lost.
I warned you Khabib fanboys. You guys called me a hater for saying that he should have stayed much longer. And now someone is here to take his legacy. He just need 3 more wins to surpass Khabib's winning streak, title wins, and title defenses.  There is no such thing as "He's done enough" in such a sport. PPl never learn.
6 performance bonuses 👀
Congrats to the ufc on the best year in mma history!
Sean O'malley vs Adrian Yanez next pls
