00:20 LeBron with the travel lmao
lebron went brazyy after melo disrespected him. 🔥🐐.
The king and his Royal   Court does it again
Ο Ελληνας πατερας ειναι respect του λεμπρον τζειμς
The only one who thinks James is the goat is Shannon.
I don't think that thier is any other legitimate way to earn money nowadays rather than investing
Nahhh I’m a laker fan but I wanted hornets to win lool
Kuzma 12 in 32minutes... Caldwell 7 in 29... They need to wake up. Extra work for Lebron to keep the team afloat.
Lamelo ties the game and then taken out by the coach. This is why FIBA is the real basketball. NBA = fake basketball
Estamos asistiendo a las defensas más penosas de la historia. No defiende nadie, por miedo a los árbitros. Penoso!!
LeMVP
Borego went with Devonte instead of Melo down the stretch. Makes no sense.
Buen partido la verdad, una gran victoria de los Lakers 😃😃😃
1:52  LeBron to Melo: i'm not the Goat kid, it's behind me.
She is the best commentator out of those cringe ones
Everyone here is not American? Cos NBA YouTube is only in America  America the shithole Except basketball that's good Hockey baseball NFL is shit
1:18 #lebron #james caught cheating by trying to provoque a fault... the referee didn’t buy it... how can someone compare this cheater with the greatest of all times MJ?
0:43 damn lebron did kuzma dirty! He almost knocked him out😹😹😹
Gotta love the Kooze
I feel like LBJ plays better when hes on his own hopefully he can keep it up when Davis comes back
Lebron and AD are better than KD and Gianis Antentakumpu . And this season, unlike at Caviliers, they have 3 point shooters .
King lebron I am from dominican republic ♥️
There you go, Ms. Finds-The-Bottom-Of-The-Net 😂 So annoying.
Carusso the GOAT 🐐
Bottom of the net commentator back at it again
Lamelo is 19 dropping 26 points against the Lakers man this kid is so nice
Lbj overrated. Clips gonna beat them in the playoffs
Just me or someone else was looking for Lamelo in every Lebron bucket?
What are you doing grandpa😱😱😱
Lebron MVP! Lamelo is trash!
The TANK LBJ, even at age 40 i think he can play like a MONSTER TRUCK
🐐 James showed up Skip Bayless!!
LEBRON ,GOAT 😍
Why is this lady so monotone😭
Njoy this LBJ kid while ur'll can cause we'll never see anything like him in our lifetime
does anyone know why ft 69%? of the king
I think Lebron watched BBALLBREAKDOWN before the game and he did what coach Nick adviced him.
I AM NUMBER ONE BABY...
Lebron had to come hard after Melo said he weren’t excited to play him 😭
Who is this commentating wtf
