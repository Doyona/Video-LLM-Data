0:39 the way Michael screamed like 😝😂
Whenever me and my wife eat McDonald's I feel like this is what we look like 😂😂😂
Couldn’t imagine plowing that. Sheesh
The most I’ve ever heard Micheal talk
Wow Tammy is so green with jealousy. She should use her sisters success to better herself as well as be happy for Amy. Can’t stand her
Amy can't take care of 1 child .I feel sorry for gaga. Hes so cute but they should not have anymore  cause she's a horrible parent. She doesn't  listen to her doctor,smokes around him and let's him crawl around on nasty hotel room floors. I feel so sorry for gage having them for parents.
I'm so happy for Amy, seeing recent episodes and how great she's with gage, her success is heartwarming and so inspiring
Tammy is such trash. They called her all happy and all she did was act rude.
Tammy is such a hater
Whats up with Michael hes barely on camera and he never talks ever does he not wanna be or what its wierd
Their doctor literally said Amy was supposed to wait and ya’ll are invalidating that and calling it “opinion”. Ya’ll probably don’t believe in COVID lmao 😭
Tammy saying it like that wasn't bc she didn't want amy to have a baby it is bc the dr told amy to wait at least 2 years after surgery to have a baby. Because of complications!!! I do believe Tammy is happy for her to have a baby. Tammy wants to be married and is hurt because she can't find a someone to love her for who she is just yet. She keeps putting herself out there on these bbw sites and it's just helping her find men who want her bc she's fat. Not to really get to know her they're just looking to feed her or use the fat as a sexual fetish!!!
I freaking love Amy and Michael 😩❤️
some people  should not procreate..
Whats up with Michael is he just shy or something else wrong watched the show he doesn't talk amy will talk for 15 mins straight he just says yeah or ok
It’s so cute when her husbands like ARE YE SERIOUS
Amy is a prime example that if you want something bad enough and you work for it it’ll come. She wanted children and she couldn’t cause of her weight. She lost that weight and ended up pregnant. Although, not at the right time she got to have her child that she wanted. Prayers that she’ll get to have that second child when she loses more weight! ❤️
You’re know you’re not supposed to be pregnant rn!? Girl you know you shouldn’t be hiding Twinkie’s under your bed
Her husbands reaction was so heart warming lol he looked so happy !!
Woahhhh chill
OMG ITS BEEN 9 MONTHS
Tammy is a straight up hater!!! Smh Amy deserve the world. She is so kind and sweet.💛 I am so happy for her and her hubby. They are true genuine people!🥰
Little Gage is sooocute!!!
This is incredibly sad. She is mentally challenged, old and puts food above her own health and her family. Some people should not have children. And yes i'm one of those people since im very physically ill. It is what it is and people should stop being so selfish.
I AM SO PROUD OF HER MG-
That's rich coming from tammy considering she has literal forehead fat.
Being an aunt is the best of the best of the best thing ever to me.
Tammy is beyond jealous that Amy has the life Tammy wants
I'm so happy for her! I feel like I'm going to cry. Fertility issues are no joke, and it must be so satisfying that she reached her goal! Its a shame her sister wasn't supportive of the news, but thank goodness she has her husband to be there for her.
You all defending Tammy attitude but for fake sake Amy is 33 she can't weit another 2 years it would be so risky to have a first child at that age especialy with her health she isn't old but having a first child at 35-36 with her helth problems would up risk that her child would have autism or other mental disability and if she realy is concern she wouldn't say "I wish you were joking" she would simply said that she is happy for her but it's dangerous and she needs to be careful during pregnency and ecpecialy she wouldn't be making Amy do everything for her and act like a child whenever her sister doesn't agree with her
I'm so Happy for Her this is precious
You look great
Beautiful just beautiful .
amy looks so much better, happier and healthier!
her baby will be so cute
This doesnt seem safe. Amy JUST had surgery and her body is in full body-fat burning mode. This baby will not come out healthy and it is very dangerous for the mother. Tammy is right here, this isn't good news.
Why would anyone get that pregnant? Men seriously need to start having higher standards.
I'm happy for her to make this changes.
I hate Tammy so much she never can be happy for anyone because she’s not happy she gets jealous because she can’t change
I was happy when I found out I was pregnant but now I’m having so many complications with my health I’m scared
I'm happy for her!
I feel like people are being too harsh on tammy in these comments. She was worried about the health of mum and baby who still definitely aren't at the place they should be for a healthy pregnancy. I think her concern was misinterpreted
god DAMN i love this woman. she’s so determined and sweet!! freaking congrats to her what a legend
" you are not supposed to get pregnant".  Yeah? And you aren't supposed to be 600 lb but here we are, Tammy, here we are. Geez she is unbelievable.
she said bitch please 💀💀
Omg! Tammy has NEVER been supportive of Amy. Plus she is always getting jealous of Amy for any progress made, all the while making excuse after excuse for her lack of wight loss. She is so unsupportive, negative, and jealous. Well, Tammy, If you actually put as much effort into exercising and dieting as much as you do making excuses, you too could be starting a family or something else you wanted to do. I have no sympathy left for her. Well done, Amy and congratulations!
Amy is beautiful
But why does her husband look like the titan that tried to eat Armin and Eren though?
Man I always love their show. It's so beautiful! They should have their own Social media
is this her 2 baby or is this there first baby?
Mais algum comentário brasileiro por aque? 🥺
Oh my god I’ve had it with Tammy. Amy told her she was pregnant and Tammy probably didn’t even care. I think Tammy is jealous of her sisters success
Tammy is such a negative presence in Amy's life.
0:38
Ik Tammy is Amy's sister but who is she to tell them when to have a baby its her life
Amy is my fav Tammy is so negative and jealous and Amy is so positive and tries to lose weight
Someone impregnated that? Gross
WOW! she's come a long way! it's awesome to see someone turn their life around like this!
How did she get pregnant, someone would actually have to think she’s the least bit attractive, or else be extremely drunk to touch her
I am sooooo happy for them🥺💕💋
And this is precisely why people like Amy better than Tammy
I love this so much :,) I’m so happy for her
I love it how, Amy calls her husband "Dude" 😂😂
Tammy doesn't know the word "Congratulations!!"
Amy’s sister is so mean and jealous  Amy got her weight down Tammy never seemed to want to lose the weight I know it must be terribly hard Congratulations Amy and I forgot her partners name
Dang, I’m so happy for her. She has been wanting this for so long.
Tammy is a negative hateful person, 🙄 if she wants her life to improve she has to put in the work no 1 can do that for her
Yikes...we dont need their gene's out in the gene pool...
She is so incredible and i hope for her to still lose weight
She wasn't fat this whole time.. she was just pregnant.
It’s not like Amy wanted to get pregnant immediately she wanted to get healthy lose more weight and then get pregnant so the fact that Tammy was so rude it when she said that she was pregnant it was kind of irritating
Her sister mean, why isn’t she happy for her.
I love see says dude 💅💅💅👸👸👑👑👑
i felt so bad for amy hearing her sister say that. this was supposed to be their weight loss journey together and Amy is the only one making progress and her sister just keeps dragging her down and they just keep trying to include her. just wow. this moment made me cry of happiness for them!
Im so happy amy found a man like him 😊 he a good guy
I think it's kind of rude how Tammy said that to amy
I gasped in excitement when I read the title! Congrats!!
They are so cute 🥰
I want to cry here 🥺
Amy took a selfish risk for that baby's life. Thank God he's okay though
She's pregnant, not we
Tammy hates that she's having a baby, means Amy won't be her slave anymore
I honestly was so happy for Amy and even though things got dangerous because of how soon after surgery she got pregnant, she got what she worked hard for!
Wow Amy 👏 looking 👏 fine
1:58 “ you know you aren’t supposed to be pregnant right now? “ BITCH PLEASE GET A LIFE AT LEAST YOUR SISTER IS DOING SOMETHING WHILE YOU ARE JUST HATING ON HER STFU 🤡
WTF IM SO HAPPY FOR THEM😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Amy made alot of recovery in the future and actually lost even more weight she looks better then ever now! but tammy its sad to say this but she got even worse over time.
I get it, if my sister came to me four months after a major surgery and told me she was pregnant, I wouldn't necessarily be overjoyed and probably worry about her, but this is Amy's DREAM. The goal of her weight loss. Concerns can be voiced later, for now she deserves to also feel like her family is celebrating with her.
1:53 just say " aww i want to , this period things sucks "
I'm so proud. ❤️
1:50 Ummmm how about “congratulations”?
I recommend Dr ighalo7 on YouTube 💚......
I'm sick of Tammy putting Amy down with her negativity, instead of being a jealous complaining bitch try being a good supportive sister and stop bringing her down all the time because she is so wrapped up in her own pathetic life
Amy “Learns”
Tammy is literally so negative.  At least Amy healthy , unlike here.
No te entendi ni verga no habl9 ingles
Awwe this couple is too cute
"I wish he was lying to you"  wtf???
Tammy  is so jealous on any little thing or big thing Amy does or accomplish its really sad to see a sister be so hateful and jealous.... Amy has done the work while Tammy has gained 100 pounds 🤦🏽‍♀️
Regardless of her health and weight etc. She seems like a lovely woman. I’m happy for her!
Aww that's too cute that's all she wanted too ! -&- lose weight 🤍🥺
"Try being my size amy YOU. DONT. KNOW. HOW. IT. IS"~Amy *Best quotes Lmao-*
Amy is doing so well 🥺
Tammy is so jealous, Amy actually made progress towards losing weight and she did it.
Any person would've said congrats to their sister and Tammy goes 'I wish you weren't pregnant'. Her negativity is sickening.
Amy is so so sweet
"you know you're not supposed to be pregnant right now" You're just being jealous, like hun be happy for her! she has wanted a child for so long and now she finally can
Tammy is so negative and unsupportive, Amy has made a huge difference to her life, Tammy has not, she can’t be mad about that
Tammy just jealous 😂😂😂😂
Tammy needs to chill. Oml
What a hateful thing to say, "I wish he was lying" FFS your sister has just told you she's PREGNANT which was her dream and THAT is all you can say? my goodness she's horrible NO ONE needs that kind of negative, nasty person in their life, don't let her drag you down to that level of misery.
Who the hells getting her pregnant???? Like Quasi modo
I'm so proud of Amy, she lost so much weight to have a baby🍼
I love the husband he’s so supportive
When she said,"Your not supposed to be pregnant right now.." I'm like u miserable asf lady that's all
I have heard that when you drop tons of weight, you can become super fertile for a window of time. That probably explains why she got pregnant on birth control.
3 HOURS?! At the doctors office?!
Did Tammy just say she wished Amy wasn't pregnant??? Bitch whattttt??😒🤨😡🤬
I love how Tammy is like really? U know ur not supposed to be pregnant right now. Well Tammy, you’re not supposed to be 100# heavier right now. Haters gonna hate.
Tammy needs to think before she speaks. Literally told her sister that she wishes that Amy wasn't pregnant. What a nice word to the baby. Why don't you kick the damn fetus while you're at it Tammy. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Gage is so cute
Tammys response translates to "damn, yall are suppose to only take care of me for the rest of yalls life, now this baby is gonna get in the way 🙄"  selfish girl child.
“I finally got to poop but there was a twist” I-
The baby has been born and is so so beautiful!
Amy need to cut Tammy off
Poor Amy , it took me a long time but I have centered myself around people that if I say The slightest achievement they uplift & encourage me ! I refuse to be around anything other than that , life is hard enough by itself you don’t need extra stress from people that “love” you
Who’s watching this after Gage
This was like my reaction lol me and my husband are Trying 5 years and I’m currently 20 weeks pregnant with a baby boy 💙x
Amy cares so much abt her sister and Tammy is always jealous and making her feel bad abt herself. 😒
Update : she gave birth to a healthy baby boy  Congrats both of you
Wait...so she learned that she was pregnant 2 months ago and her baby is out now? What..?
Congratulation on your newest member of your family. He is sooo beautiful. All the best.🍼👨‍👩‍👦👼
Amy: we are pregnant  Tamy: Bitch what!!!!!!
i don't know why i was drinking milk while watching this.
Baby's here and healthy ☺️
“I wish he was lying to you” sister or not at this point Tammy’s toxicity and narcissism is ridiculous. She knows how much Amy wants a baby 😩 truly sad. My sister would be on her own at this point, sorry 🤷🏾‍♀️.
She Looks Goooood♥️😍
i think she will be a pretty good mom
I used to watch these girls on YouTube a few years back, today I was so surprised to see they have their own show. I'm so happy to see that she has the lost so much weight and is now gonna be a mama ♥️
As much as we don't like Tammy's attitude, she's right to be a bit upset because Amy supposed to not have a child
I'm honestly so happy for them 😭
I love how Tammy is concerned all about Amy but if she spent half of her concerns about her own self she wouldn’t be in her situation..
I'm soo happy !!!!!!❤
I’m honestly so happy for them! They seem like they would be the nicest parents
At the beginning, she was not at the doctor's office😂 she was beside the liquor store in Providence,Kentucky 😂😂
K
Tammy Telling her sister is  too early to get pregnant when she can’t even follow through with her weight loss journey.
-i'm pregnant -U SERIOUS?!
Belly wiggle
0:38 😂😂😆
They are gonna make great parents x
Keep that child from Tammy of somebody should call CPS because she gives off toxic vibes
Aww so happy for her
Tammy won't lose weight because she has no real desire to put in the work. It's been easy for her to cry & whine all her life and people let up.
Tammy gained everything Amy lost. Karma pays in dividends
i'm genuinely curious why tammy is still so big?
Aww they look so happy 😍😍😍😍😍
She’s got another 7/8 months now... congrats to Amy for it  And I see someone is jealous over there.... the person who looked like that she hasn’t lost any weight
“she knows shes not supposed to be pregnant right now” im sorry i didnt know she had to ask your permission
1:44 that is honestly so spiteful of Tammy knowing this is something Amy has wanted forever! She is so toxic.
Tammy, we all do believe you showed jealousy and meanness at that time. AND, we all believe you can do it! You can lose the weight. We all want to see the best for you, truly. You got this!
idk  her but i feel proud as if i did :)
no one: me when my mom says shes making butt noods: 0:07
i don't think yall understand tammy's perspective...
Why is tammy so negative ?
So a person on tik toc revealed that they filmed her walking out of the "doctor's office" in reality it was a wine and spirts store😂😂😂
Yayyy
So sweet!! 💚💚💚💚(Her sister is a turd though. 😐)
That kid is gonna be stuffed in their mom's stomach.
TAMMYS SO RUDE AND FOR WHAT?
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BABY 💝💓💙
When I seen this episode I was crying. I’m so happy for Amy.
"I wish he was lying to you." How rude. She knows how much Amy wants to be a mom and this is how she responds? She needs to stop projecting her own frustrations on her own sister. Lucky for Amy, she's so happy no one can rain on her parade. She's going to be a mom! I'm sure her pregnancy is going to be closely monitored. Congrats on the baby!
Yayyy it’s so good to see her journey!!
La envidia de tammy se le sale por los poros, es una perra. Felicidades Amy 🥰
tammy real negative.. her sister is pregnant. she’s supposed to be happy for her, but no. she says “i wish he was lying” girl. she needs to put in more effort of losing weight, maybe then she could have a kid of her own. amy just wants the best for herself, her kid, her sister etc. tammys negative energy won’t be good for her..
She becomes so beautiful 💕💕
She looks so much more happy, I think it’s rubbing off on me
THIS, is body positivity. Great job yo, takes an incredibly strong person to get over the mountain of obesity. Great job
I’m happy for Amy but Tammy is right. It may be a little bit too soon to have a baby... the pregnancy could be dangerous.
She needs to loose weight or she could crush the baby
micheal your awsome
I hope that everything goes so well for her 🥺❤️!
Sou do Brasil e não entendo inglês. Algu traduz 😭
Yes 😭 omg I’m so proud 😫
Let’s not make this comment section a hate on Tammy zone. Yes her attitude was very negative but she’s obviously sad deep down and taking it out on Amy, and these comments don’t help we need to support her and help her feel for positive so she can also become a better person inside and out
Amy is extremely lucky to be pregnant! I’m 26.5 years old and I’m not even married or pregnant!
Amy I'm so excited for you and I absolutely love you!
What the actual heck. Tammy is so negative because she knows that Amy eats healthier and loses weight. And Tammy just wants to drag her down, because she didn't succeed at having the surgery. " You are not supposed to be pregnant" who says that?
Tammy so selfish lmao
I love Michael. We need to protect him at all costs!
I’m so happy for you!!!!
amy has made so much progress im happy for her! but i dont know if tammy is willing
K
TRY BEING MY SIZE AMY YOU DONT KNOW HOW IT IS
I don’t think Tammy was acting jealous here at all. She’s right - it is too soon. Amy’s lost a lot of weight but she’s still obese, and many people gain weight and are less mobile when pregnant. She also has an increased risks of complications too. Congratulations to her regardless. Hope this doesn’t offset her progress!
Hey girl ! Wish you all the best ! you are a strong woman !!!! ❤️❤️🍀🍀 never give up !! 💪💪💪💪
0:38
What’s wrong with Tammy 😭
0:39 Those eyes and that sound just don’t go well together...
tammy needs to get a life if she cant be happy for no one but herself
So proud of Amy. I knew Tammy was going to be the last, toxic , jealous negative one from the jump. Amy need to distance herself if u ask me.
She is not mad because she wasn't suppose to get pregnant.  She's mad because she's jealous.
Congratulations!!!!🎊🎉
I think Tammy thinks that if they have a kid, then they won’t have time to help Amy! I also think a Tammy is a bit jealous that Amy is getting better and Tammy isn’t!
Tammy seems mad... congratulations amy.
Tammy is mad because she knows her sister won’t be there to do everything for her when she gives birth to her child. It’s quite a selfish way of thinking really.  Congratulations to Amy and her hubby though!!! Well done ♥️
So happy for her
I love that she finnally gets to be a mom,  tammy can have a good life but shes not doing nun but eating and getting worst.
Amys husbands reaction.....was funny asf😂😂😂
I’m so happy for her🥺☺️☺️❤️☺️😍😍😍😍
Aaaaaw they're so cuuute! I love them! I hope everything goes right for them and the baby! :D
Fat
Amy is too pure for Tammy
Yayyyy!!!!
Amy is jealous
IM SO PROUD OF AMYYYY!!! YOU GO GIRLLLLLLL!
Jesus loves you pray to God!!
Shes a normal American weight now
Her husband is literally like “are you serious i am a virgin”
I love Amy
The fact she said “ errr *we’re* pregnant” kskdksk im wheezing
I feell like Tammy has gotten fatter?
"you got the wrong person dude" LMAO
Let’s hope her pregnancy is safe
Her sister toxic asf like girl stfu
Tammy, SHUT UP
amy like actually tried to get healthy and tammy still sitting
i can't tell if tammy is being concerned or being jealous.... hopefully the former.
She looks so happy and healthy I am so proud of her
Oh boy Tammy hella jealous now😪🤧
Honestly this makes me super happy
I'm so happy for Amy, she is a pretty selfless person, she will be a good mother
She has lost so much weight compared to when the show started!
Damn she has lost so many weight. She looks amazing!
Amy is a legend
As a person who struggled to get pregnant for 6 years and had to loose weight to get pregnant, (lost 50lbs and then had twins) it broke my heart when Tammy  said "I wish he was lying"... Even tho she wasn't supposed to be pregnant so soon, her sister should have still been supportive.
Amy !!! Wow you look so good ! You rock girl !! 🥳🥰🥰
Coming from a man, I love when women say WE’RE pregnant.. ladies, do yourself and your relationship a favor and say we’re pregnant not I’m pregnant.. it’ll make your husband/boyfriend/fiancé feel so good and included in the pregnancy, after all it’s his child too and I guarantee you he burned more calories making that baby than you did lol
At least her bills are paid 👄💄💅
I think Tammy acted like this because she only has her sister and when Amy has her baby then all the attention will go towards the baby and Tammy will feel left out.
tammy should honestly be happy for her own sister amy
im so happy for her! She is so brave
Tammy you are awesome keep on amazing work
Amy deserves some happiness shes tried hard to lose the weight
Im so dead. Their sense of humour is just hilarious
I'm not making fun of her in any way but I just find it hilarious that at 00:59 she says "im like what?" And her lazy eye goes 👉  What I'm saying is that her expression and eye just makes her shocked words funnier
Her baby will be even more motivation to keep caring for herself so she can see him grow up and play with him. She worked hard to achieve this and she deserves it.
Promise I'm asking this out of genuine curiosity and not from a malicious point but does anyone know what happened/is going on with Amy's eyes? I *just* started watching the show, so have no idea if they've gone over it or ever acknowledge it. Thanks to whomever takes time out of their day to read and respond back! Much appreciated! 😊💕
Oh my god I’m so happy for her!!
wow im so proud of her and I hope her pregnancy goes well
I love you both!! I’ve been watching you!! Congratulations to you both on your pregnancy!! I’m so sorry you both deal with haters and ugliness!! Keep on KEEPING ON!! I’m having to lose weight too!! I’m actually sticking to it.. made changes. Tammy I HAVE FAITH IN YOU!! You got this!! We both do!! Hugs to you both!! 😀
What is her YouTube channel
I do not want to say things like "Tammy needs to workout omg" because I dont know how hard it is to handle the weight. I hope she gets better
Congratulations , best wishes , your blessed. Stay safe and healthy young lady.
why is tammy jealous. like instead of losing 50 pounds in a month, she gains.
Im really proud of you and know you are going to be a good mother,  love you guys and really like your show
The kiss was so sweet 🥺🥺
Amy needs to separate herself from Tammy . You can see clearly that she is so jealous of her . She will forever be in her situation because for one she is lazy as shit and has no desire to change . Amy need to get herself and her baby away from negative ass Tammy
Tammy is turning into her mother.
Tammy is a jealous bitter witch, how can you be so mean & look like a walking house. Eurgh
Proud of you Amy girl💕
Tammy just needs to go. She's a bad person, she's a useless person.
Tammy was concerned, she Even told her: i want You to have a kid, but it's too soon, and she is right.
“I finally got to poop, but there was also a little twist”
I’m actually happy for amy
@ 0:39 😂😂😂 sounded like a hawk
Yay!!!!!!!!!
Keep going Amy you got this ....
I am truly crying I’m so happy for them 🥰❤️
Praying for a healthy baby. Still don’t look like she lost much weight, my daughter n law’s sister had the same surgery and within  a year she’s under 200 lbs. don’t understand why they still so big.
Tammy is so mean bye
Tammy is so selfish to her.
Who knows these sisters real channel here??
she looks so good!!!
I do watch Amy on Youtube way before this show and I was so proud of her. She looks healthier and skinnier. She looks happier also. Hope after this show end, she and her baby will be healthy too!
So happy for her, she has done amazing ❤
God help that child...
Wow this progress is amazing. Get some girl.
“I wish he was lying” HOW RUDE. If someone said that to me I would have blocked them right then and there.
HEY LADIES I JUST RECENTLY STARTED WATCHING YOUR PROGRAM ON TLC AND NOW ON YOUTUBE ALSO! I LOVE YOU TWO! DONT LET THE HATERS GET TO EITHER ONE OF YOU, WE ALL HAVE HATERS NO MATTER WHAT! BUT MORE OF US LOVE YOU ALL AND WISH YOU THE BEST! ACTUALLY YOU ARE ENCOURAGING ME TO GET OFF MY LAZY BUTT AND GET STARTED LOSING WEIGHT! FRIENDS FOREVER ! DIANE!  YALL KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

Oh god she’s going to stop losing weight after she has the baby geez she needs to lose more weight
I'm happy for her and hope she continues her amazing weight loss journey.
Tammy being toxic is...
Amy looks good and she lost so much weight I'm proud of her and now she is pregnant and I'm happy for her 🙂💜
WHy does tammy not be proud of amy? Shes just like WTFFF
im so proud of amy, hoping she has a safe pregnancy and a safe delivery
“Bitch please 😂“
While being pregnant may cause Amy to gain a couple pounds, when the baby is a toddler Amy will be running around chasing them, playing with them, and will be a great mom
wow that’s great progress & congrats! i hope your baby doesn’t have any medical problems.
I love how Amy calls her husband "dude." That's something I would do😂😂👏
May God bless her and her family!💕 such great news🙏🏾
She can't help it if she's pregnant amy is happy and that's all that matters tammy needs to stop hating on her sister
Where did Amy get the sugar skull shirt when she was getting a pedicure
Amy looks so happy after losing weight and now she's pregnant gurll I'm proud of you so much
Tammy is killing herself she hasn’t made any progress I hope she will lose weight but she also smokes she will never get better 😞
when she said i’m pregnant i got shivers
Tammy’s just mad cuz now Amy has to take care of a real baby
Keep that baby away from Tammy
You guys are so freaking stupid and annoying she’s just worry about her sister she just had surgery four months ago and now She pregnant that can give her some setbacks or problems if she’s not careful that’s all stop saying that she’s mean and hateful y’all should know how Siblings are ...You know damn well you’re not all Mary Poppins with your siblings the ones that have them  or with family members. So chill
i hope her baby will be born fine and healthy, because she seems like such a genuine and kind person
Trailer trash Action Bronson
I feel bad for the baby already it's gonna be just like them
I give mad props to that dude for actually having sex with her. 😂🤮😂
I’m actually really proud of her! She was able to take control over her life and now she is going to have a baby. I hope everything goes smoothly and she has a healthy and happy baby.
I thought BBW couldn't get pregnant?
Tammy is just jealous because her bills aren’t paid
FICK YASS AMY
IM SO PROUD OF AMY
She is looking great!
You guys.. do you not realize how terrible this is for her weight loss. Literally the worst timing ever. That poor poor child. Hopefully they don't inherit any of the family's fat genes or looks.
“You know you’re not supposed to be pregnant right now”  And you know you’re supposed to be able to walk to your freaking mailbox right now?  Tammy is just jealous Amy has the willpower to make such drastic changes to her life
AMYS👏BILLZ👏ARE👏PAID
perioddd HER BILLS ARE PAIDD
Tammy makes me so mad
YESSS AMYYYY
I really hope she keeps the weight off during her pregnancy and doesn’t eat it all back
Didn’t she steal a bunch of money from her fans because she claimed Tammy was “dying”? Yeesh that’s scummy.
So I just wanna let everyone know that the building she is walking out of is the Rack House liquor store in providence kentucky. The fist shot of her walking out the door, is the left front window of the store. Didn't know the liquor store in the town I live in did x-rays and pregnancy tests 😂😂
Im just confused how..He uh-😭
DONT HAVE A ABORTION KEEP THE BABY!!!
Bloody hell shes done it
SO HAPPY FOR AMYY :)
also can I just say these comments are all so heart warming and congratulatory! I expected cruel, harsh, unkind comments but 99% are nothing but positivity. so many ppl congratulating her on being pregnant and expressing how proud they are at her weight loss will give her fuel to keep going. I rly hope she sees all these so she knows there are ppl rooting for her success and so proud of the success she's had thus far. keep it up Amy! you can do this, keep dropping that weight so you can keep up with your little one, trust me, the lil fckers can be quick and they suffer from never-ending energy🤣🤣 or at least my 2 daughters were that way as children. also also, "lil fcker" is a term of endearment in my household haha its like "sweet pea" basically🤣
CONGRATS AMY!!! Now you have something and someone to live for and fight for. Break the chain, make sure he grows up with proper nutrition and proper nutrition education so he knows how to be healthy and stay healthy. You can do this, you've got yourself a good support group now. give him the guidance with food you wish you would have had a child. I know you've said that in your family being overweight is seen as genetically inevitable and most feel like it's pointless to try but it isn't.  you can break the chain and make sure you're the last generation in your family to deal with morbid obesity. Im so happy for you! losing 100 lbs and having a baby all within 4 months?! its a sign that you're doing the right thing so keep it up, keep dropping those pounds so you'll be able to chase your son around the yard and keep up with him. You can do this girl!!! give him a good role model like I know you can.🤍🤍🤍 you're kicking ass, dont stop!
Tammy is deff jelous bc Amy’s lost so much weight and she hasn’t
Wow Amy lost a lot of weight
she’s so funny 😂😂😂
I’m so proud of her she’s come so far
This makes me happy 🥺 she did it❤️❤️
Imagine😂
Tammy may have been concerned because Amy wasn't supposed to get pregnant yet, but the way she said it was very dismissive and negative.
anybody saw she got a crosseye🥴🤚
Amy learns she’s pregnant why does she learn
Tammy is so negative I can't deal with her energy. She's so miserable with her life she projects it onto her sisters happiness
Omlllll I’m so happy for them! 😤❤️
Im so proud of amy she lost weighy shes gonna have her baby her life is just going up im waiting for tammy to go up🖤
Ignoring all the bad things that might happen to her or her child right now, I’m incredibly happy for her and her husband, she’s come such a long way and her work in losing weight may still be going, but I’m so happy for them. She’s wanted a child for so long, it’s so heartwarming to see this because for the longest time she thought she’d never have a child, but here she is, she’s healing, she’s doing better. (DONT MENTION TAMMY COMMENTING ON IT LET ME HAVE MY MOMENT IM HAPPY FOR THEM)
Thats literally disgusting
And here I am giving up all sugar and carbs in order to try to conceive after three years of trying like a damn fool. Some people have all the luck.
Hope all goes well!
The title makes no sense it said Amy learns how to be pregnant it's no sense.
I really feel like tammy was just jealous of amy's improvement like you could have been right there with her but she just chose not to try and amy did.
I hope she'll have a safe pregnancy 😋
Puts mask on in car after kissing husband 🤣
she looks amazing omg
Amy used Tammy for money and she fed her up now she’s left her behind fat and in need and is having a baby
Girl You look amazing 😍😍😙 Congratulations ❤️
Her weight loss is so amazing. I feel so happy for her
Nice job Amy!
"seriously?" "Im serious"  (silence)  "AHH"
Amy is amazing & has a great personality. Tammy is so mean, she thinks she funny but she’s Not . She blames Amy & Amy helps her do everything, she should be so much nicer to her instead of being so damn mean & jealous
“I was like what 🎱👄👁”
"I'm serious as a heart attack."
Amy has a great personality !! She is hard working and reached her goals not like her lazy sister
🥴🥺🥺🥺😟
I have been waiting for this!!!!
Amy: We're pregnant Tammy: Bitch please✨💅
I’ve been watching her makeup tutorials for YEARS for ASMR. I’m so proud of her
Amy: I thought the doc was lying to me😳  Tammy: 🗣️I wish he was lying to you  Meanwhile Tammy is still in a wheelchair.  So happy for Amy because she tried and never gave up.
I'm a very negative person but even I think Tammy's way too f****** negative like Jesus Christ can't you be happy for your sister yes it's a stressful thing to be pregnant and still struggling with weight and health but she's about to get something in her life that she is dreamed of be happy for her and show support is that so hard I'm genuinely happy for Amy and I hope she has a safe and healthy pregnancy and birth
They're so cute together.
amy looks so good 🥺🤍
omg how michael screamed 😍
that is Great❤
Amy looks good 👍
Amy’s paying her bills 💅🏻💅🏻
Amy’s hubby is so wholesome. Hope her pregnancy goes well 🥺
omg this is amazing!
OH MY GOD! I'm so happy, Amy! As someone who shares the difficulty of being overweight (I'm 83kg now) and that highly desires to be a mom someday (although I'm just turning 18 this year djsksk), it's so relatable and cute. I really wish the best for both sisters, but Amy deserves all praises. She's strong, amazingly cute, caring to everyone... her husband is so good to her and I hope he's gonna keep his nice behavior and that they have a health and wealth family!
I am so proud of Amy she did amazing 🥺🎉
I remember the first episode of 1000lb sisters, she said "i feel incomplete as a woman since i cant have kids" im SO HAPPY that shes got pregnant and have lost over 100lb!!!
OMG SHE LOOKS SO GOOD
Wow, if I got the reaction Tammy gave her sister o er the pregnancy announcement,  I would've balled my eyes out! They're sisters! How can she not be happy for her!? 🥺
Omg... her husband is getting big too...
Dammm AMY GOD BLESS YOU GOOD JOB NOT GIVING UP!
GO AMY! Congratulations
0:38 When you’re home alone and you sneeze and someone says Bless you
Congrats sis💙
I told them to check four times. I love her 😍
Tammy is a real life " evil step sister", except she's a full sister. She has such a dark heart. Now jealousy between siblings is natural, but she should have been very happy even if she was jealous. That's how love works.
“Bitch please!”
The only reason I think Tammy's comments came from a place of jealousy instead of concern is because obviously she dosent care enough ab her own weight. Shes on the verge of death but is concerned for her sister carrying a baby.
So proud of amy, congratulations on your pregnancy, keep up the hard work
That poor child
i think tammy is upset bc she has made no progress
This genuinely brought a smile to my face, I'm so happy for her, it's what she's always dreamed of and she's gonna make such a fantastic mother, I just know it 💕
Tammy is just jealous.
I’m happy for her but isn’t this a little to soon to be getting pregnant after her surgery? Like this could be potentially very, VERY, dangerous for her and the baby.
Amy!! You look amazing I’m so proud of you!! Congratulations on the pregnancy girl!!
God loves you and hes coming back sooon repent 😽
The people who are saying “I’m so happy for her” really need a reality check! She’s fat due to her own stupid life decisions. She has absolutely no right to bring a child into this world when she can barely look after herself. It’s disgusting. I’m not a toxic person, just brutally honest. It’s 2021 people get real!
What episode is this?
shes doing so well,i hope her baby will be ok
Damn Amy made so much process !! I’m so proud of her . she should be so proud of herself . 🥰 .
amy mentioned a lot of times before that she wants to help tammy and that they should lose their weight together but tammy isnt trying at all
Im so happy for them ! 🥰❤️
That thumbnail is like a cover shot for Alabama
Bro I just KNEW Tammy was gonna be hateful. She's always so mean toward Amy and her progress, never anything nice to say. I just knew that bitch was gonna be negative 🙃
Wow
Amy’s bills are paid !!!
This show has been so heart warming low key, every time I check back it’s like happy news
i’m so proud of amy
Awww
The presence of a hint of a neck really makes and breaks appereance
Congrats bby
should i come back in september lol
I love how she says 'we're pregnant' instead of 'Im pregnant'
I’m happy for her hope everything goes well!
I'm so happy for Amy and her husband!
I finally got to poop 😂
Tammy is so jealous omfg
I'm so proud of her. She made it like a real champions queen!
You ain't a prize
i hope that baby doesn’t go thru this🥺
Aww im so happy for her 🥰
Yesss! I’m so proud of her honestly I’ve been with her journey for like a year.
I’m so happy for her and her husband. This makes me so happy
Rip that kid
Aweeeeee. I love them so much
Is Amy still losing weight and getting healthier? Congratulations Amy
YAYY YAY YAYYY
I love amy
period Amy!! Congratulations🥳😍🤩
Amy are u cross sided

This is so sweet amy is doing so great I’m so happy for her
They are so cuteeeeee honestly
She lost so much weight, Im so happy for her
they’re so chill about her being pregnant
Her weight lost was so amazingly great and now she's pregnant, i hope she'll have a safe pregnancy
Wait no I wanna see le baby
Congratulations!! ❤️❤️❤️
Im so happy for them, Amy looks absolutely glowing
Tammy is making me mad she hasn’t lost any weight and she isn’t trying like amy
Awww I'm so happy for her!!! That was one of her main motivators early on 👶
0:40 her smile she’s so happy and hopeful i hope she continues this path and her sister too🥺❤️
She is amazing for losing all the weight, I always see these shows and it’s just for entertainment but to actually see someone commit because they have a goal and follow through is just outstanding, I pray she has a safe pregnancy
These are the “fat people” that should be respected, there’s the ones who actually commit to weight loss then there’s the petty ones and that think being morbidly obese is BoDy PoSiTiVy
wow! congrats to her and i hope it goes well and safe!!!
I love seeing Amy getting her motivation to change her life and I sincerely hope there are no complications with her pregnancy ❤️ she’s worked her tuckus off
0:31 was . A M A Z I N G
Yayyyyyyy❤❤❤
her husband has gotten so fat
I hope Amy has a safe pregnancy
I saw the episode its funny
I’m happy for them that she got pregnant but I hope they, all of them not just the sisters continue to lose weight. The dude could stand to lose some weight too.
She’s going to lose a bit of weight when she gives birth
she’s lost so much weight oh my god
I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER AND I HOPE THST SHE HAS A SAFE PREGNANCY.💕💕
What happened to her eye?
tammy is so jealouse
My mom was overweight and diabetic when she was pregnant with me and she actually lost some weight and was the healthiest she had ever been while pregnant with me. I am also healthy! You got this Amy, congrats!
Woooo!!
The doctors really said Surprise Shawtyyyyyy
ngl she looks ugly but wow good shes pregnant
Tammy sounds so ghetto through the phone 😭💀
Aw 🥰😍
How’d Tammy actually gain weight?
This is gonna sound awful, but her neck looks thinner! nice job!
What episode is this
Wth im so early to this whole thing
omg i’m actually so happy for her
She's doing an amazing job
How does it feel knowing your a meme
She's pregnant when she is clogged up
Okay, but Tammy could of showed concern, but ALSO some support for her sister since she's known it to be a dream of Amy's to have a kid.
Well I wouldn’t get her pregnant but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Also, well done, hon.
Okayyyyyyyyyy.....
Amy congratulations you have done so well and having a baby as well
I’m so happy she’s dropped so much weight
Yay
Congratulations!!!!!! I pray that it’s a healthy pregnancy and all goes well. It broke my heart when I saw her break down and say she felt incomplete.
Tammy is just worried about her sisters health and the baby.  This is so close to a major surgery she has had. So there are more complications.
OH GOD,,,,, POLLUTING THE GENE POOL MORE
They so adorable
Congratulations
I just saw this on tv and had to look it up again for Michael screaming 😂I’ve never seen him with so much emotion 😂 but I’m happy for them love amy good for her
Congratulations God don’t make no mistake you do good in Jesus Christ name amen 🙏
Congratulations on your pregnancy praying for a safe and healthy pregnancy, delivery and baby Amy
I’m so proud of her and I’m crying because she’s such a strong lady
Oh wow good luck exciting.
THIS IS SO AWESOME!!! CONGRATS!!
😑
she slimmed down alot,, im so proud of her :,)
I’m so so happy for her, she’s had so much amazing progress and now she’s having a baby!! this is so amazing for her and she looks amazing 🥺🥺
If anyone should NOT be breeding it's these two.
Be proud Amy I got pregnant 2 months after mine and my baby is healthy and 11 years old now
Congratulations 🎈 Watch your show wish you and your sister lots of love and a healthy new year ❤
I'm so happy for her! I never knew she lost so much weight AND she's pregnant! I hope her baby is born healthy and happy!

Omg I'm so happy for her! Shes worked so hard for this moment! I know she will be a great momma! I hope she has a happy and healthy pregnancy ❤
Amy looks so good! OMG
This is so cute
That poor child.
She could look out the window and at him at the same time....
0:38 😅
Not anything against them, but parenting is such a hard thing, so I’m a little bit worried for the child...
Amy you are going to be ok, you had your surgery 4 months ago. That is 120 days of healing and love, don’t doubt yourself 🥰 Shine!!! This is your time!!!🥰
WHAT im so happy for her!! and so proud of her!! amy you’re doing great, good luck with the pregnancy<33
it wasn’t even amy’s fault she got pregnant since she was on birth control but tammy is still mad at her?
michaels reaction was so cute🥰
congrats amy!!
Glad that Amy is doing well
wow Amy starts to achieve her goals, she lost a lot of weight and i love how her husband supports her
I'm proud of Amy she lost a lot of weight hope she has a good life
Her sister is always so jealous 😔🤦🏿‍♀️😂
1:30 I expect to see 2 babies(if each of em are bearing only 1 😄)
Congratulations! 💗✨
Nice place and view 👇 https://youtu.be/qnUbabog4Do
awwwe im soo happy for amy she looks so beautiful she as ways have but it's shining through more then everything
She’s come far and worked hard,  She deserves it (:
"I asked them to check it 4 times"  😂🤣
Even this Amy girl... I have lived in Ireland for 26 years and I have NEVER seen a person her size in my life UNTIL I went to America. And Tammy is a different kettle of fish altogether. Eating yourself to the size where you can’t even WALK anymore is the single most repulsive thing I could ever imagine. I have no problem with overweight people. But America ALWAYS takes things too far.
Tammy is upset bc amy isn’t supposed to be pregnant.... Tammy is literally on the verge of immobility
I didn’t realise who it was at first the weight loss was amazing
This makes me so happy
Wow!
HOLY SHIT SHE LOOKS AMAZING
Wow she’s lost a lot of weight.. she’s looking so much better and healthier. Good for her, I hope it continues and she’s around for her baby
Aw I'm happy for her. I hope she has a safe pregnancy and delivery
God has a perfect plan for you why you’re pregnant. Take in a positive way and take it as a blessing 🌸❤️❤️❤️
OMG! Congratulations girl 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️ you are such a wonderful and beautiful woman. You deserve to be a mom ❤️❤️❤️
What’s the big deal about aborting the thing? Would have been done before I left tht office
AMYY!!! U DID IT!!
She slimmed down and having a baby is going to regulate her hormones and make her thinner possibly!
Congratulations! I wish you the best and hope for a well delivery💛
Congratulations a beautiful blessing❤️
POV : you came from tiktok
She has a terribly unhealthy lifestyle. There’s a good chance she’ll pass these bad eating habits onto the kid. Getting pregnant could also set her weight loss journey back. Also, she had surgery a few days ago. It’s not healthy for her or the baby
How old is Amy?
Wow so cool she’s pregnant
im very greatful for amy but im also worried since the doctor says she cannot have a baby after two years..
I am so proud and happy for Abby🥺❤️
OMGDKDHDKHDKDHDKDJ I'M SO HAPPY FOR HERRR 🥺❤❤
Awwww shes so beautiful, congrats
There are a lot of poisonous comments on this video.  I pose a question, would you judge someone with a disability for having a child? Just because someone has health issues (obesity related or not) or isn't "able-bodied" doesn't mean they are unfit to parent. There are plenty of "parents" in the US that do not deserve their children who have actually committed crimes of abuse and neglect to their children and the foster system is a prime example of this. You judge this women based solely on a TV show and condem her for wanting a child calling her a "unfit mother" and condemning her for her weight as if somehow her being overweight affects her ability to show love, care and affection to a child. Imagine someone telling you that you can't have a kid or be a good mom because you're fat. This poor women is being accused and ridiculed of being a bad mother when she hasn't even become one yet. I hope her pregnancy and health continue to improve.
so proud of my girl amy!!
Smh shr is going to blow back up
Tammy seems jealous you can tell in her face and her voice
“Bitch please”😭😭😭 bro I can’t
“We’re Pregnant “ GIRL PLSS WHOS “we”
I really want to be happy for her, she seems nice. It just seems irresponsible for her to bring a child into this workd
I’m so proud of her. She had a very long stressful journey. But she made it ❤️
Congrats 💙 I’m happy for you both!!
I’m so happy for her this is why she wanted to lose weight in the first place
I hope she has a healthy pregnancy
I don’t *love* how she calls her husband dude
so proud of amy. wishing her health and happiness for her and her family!!
Her sister is horrible.. wow
I feel so bad for the kid.
Speechless
I'm SO VERY happy for her!!@ she has such a pleasant face!!!🙂
Congratulations 👏 👏
Y’all are so mean I’m genuinely happy for her she actually lost weight and she can take care of herself she takes care of her sister. Just be happy for her Damn.
Congratulations to her
She looks so much better!
Wow she has really come a very long way
Congrats Amy and Michael!!!!!
Wow congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳💙❤
Dude, the weight she lost is no joke! Wow! ❤️
Buzz Killington
I love amy.But that dame tammy is so mean to amy and i dont like it pluse i really dont like her...
Tammy just jealous she can’t get no man and can’t have kids
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU, AMY
Not being mean, this is the first clip I’ve ever seen... what’s wrong with her face?
Am happy for u Amy stop and take care of ur self ur a good lady am not to far u I live in Anderson county luv ya and ur sister but she needs to stop blaming u
Congratulations on the pregnancy!  A baby is always a blessing.  And also congrats on weight loss and moving forward in life!!
I’m scared for u Amy. Way too soon. Prayers for your family
Amy: "We're pregnant"   Tammy: "bitch, please"
Can't wait to see that baby. Happy news.
So he got his sister pregnant
No hate on the kid but damn, why? Can that kid possibly have a good future? 😳
Congratulations to u and amy and her husband in the baby woohooo
Disgusting
Love you Amy
I swear I had the same reaction after leaving the hospital..didn't know I was pregnant I was like what??
Ummm, how?
yo, this is so cute wtf
Im not too familiar with the sisters, never seen their show, only clips of it on YouTube maybe 3 times. Did the sister have the surgery too?
I know 2 ppl that got pregnant this early after having the same surgery. Both had healthy pregnancies, healthy babies, and are still successful on their weight loss journey. Yes, it is not the ideal situation, it is recommended to wait 12-24 months at least before trying to conceive, but...🤷‍♀️ What's done is done. Now let's just hope she stays healthy, has a healthy pregnancy, and stays on track with her weight loss 🤞 for all we know she might be an amazing mother and under 200lbs in 2 years from now. We don't know
I’m so happy for her
Ain’t no way they’re getting dick & I’m not
Congratulations 👣  your Maine girl loves you 💛
V
That's a pizza not a baby
Momma should have stopped her at the second pork chop when she was a kid. Just because you can eat two whole chickens doesn't mean that you should.
No matter “how soon” every baby is a miracle
Jesus loves you. God sent him on the cross to die for YOU so you can be freed from sin and spend all eternity in heaven. He’s coming soon!⚠️⚠️
CONGRATSSSSSS AMYYYYYYYYYY
Poor kid
Congrats on the new baby!   Stoned Mary new EP HONEY out now on all music platforms!
Tammy a hater
Amy looks so much different from a couple years ago. Hopefully the birth will go well
She crazy that ain’t no real baby that’s just a few large pizzas and around 100 chicken nuggets 😂
She needs to lose weight fast if she is to have a healthy baby as well as a healthy delivery.
poor kid
I'm so happy for her I hope her and the baby stay healthy.
YOU KNOCKED THAT THING UP!?!  Man wut a GigaChad 👊💪
I’m scared to encounter people like this.This is why I’m never leaving New York again .
Her sister is such a hater.
https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13.
Had to turn it off when she said poop
https://yubo.live/en?referral=TKPQQBEC1&source=whoadd
How is sex even possible for people like this? I just don't see how it's physically possible.
I’m sorry but I lost it at the beginning from how she said “there was a little twist” lmaoo
Yeah thats my buddies liquor store, not a Dr's office
Yuck beyond yuck
I feel like Tammy don’t want her to be pregnant because she wants amy to take care of her and not the baby
How are 1,000LBwtf you eat your entire house
🥰🥰🥰🥰
why is no one talking about the “bitch please” 💀
Obese women get pregnant? I am fat and I want to wait until I am about a size 4 to lose my virginity lol (hopefully on wedding night). I don't know if the baby will be healthy
congrats! i am praying for a healthy baby!
I’m dying i ok bet tammys reaction😂 she really said “bitch, please.” Shdbegwthqq
I’m sure there will be 5 million haters, but I’m genuinely happy for Amy. She will be a great mom.
That poor child
I feel sorry for that baby already
🤮
why can’t her sister be happy for her? her sister is just jealous because she’s working hard and losing weight and everything
I really hope she and the baby are okay
there are people in this country that just should not breed and this is one of them...
in this relationship, they love each other for the personality I'm guessing
gross. that baby will be absolutely disgusting
Awwwwwww.. I wish her a safe pregnancy n delivery ..she deserves it.
YUCK!!!!!
Thought she was already pregnant...with octuplets...due in day
Today is a new day, a new start. 2021 is here and YOU are here for such a time as this. Please don't forget it.. If you don't  already know God has a plan for you and if you are open to it, this can dramatically change your life and circumstances. (Matthew 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. ) I speak from experience that God can make all things new. It doesn't matter what we have done  or that we think we don't measure up, He will meet us where we are even in our lowest low. All that you have been through is not for nothing. YOU have a purpose , YOU have worth, YOU are a masterpiece created by God himself. For those going  through a difficult time please know trials produce strength, perseverance, wisdom, compassion for others, and experience. You are so much stronger than you know.  I am praying for each and everyone of you that God will send His angels to comfort you, surround you with His love and peace, help you through all that you are going through, and give you strength to endure this harsh world.  God sees all and one day all that is lost will be restored for His children  *(1 Corinthians 2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.)*  Please hang on and take things one day at a time) If you don't already know God in heaven sent His only begotten Son Jesus Christ  who died for you. To have a relationship with Jesus Christ it is as simple as praying and asking Him to forgive you of your wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. Then you can start a relationship ( please see the book The Holy Bible for more information ) To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen........
So Happy for you guys!!! Praying for a safe and healthy baby and mom! And dad!
Hillbilly love, is the most beautiful love of all! 💕
Hoping for a safe pregnancy 🙏
Man that guy looks like he wants to jump out of that van

I'm sure her kid will grow up to be a scholar, doctor, or astronaut one day and make great strides in bettering humanity.
what's with the call of duty zombies music? 🤣
I pray she'll have a safe pregnancy
Why are they stunned? Did they not take that class in 4th grade to understand how someone gets pregnant?
Now this is what life is about
Ewwww
And that's where trump supporters come from.
His little scream was so cute!! Congrats
God bless america
There is no weigh she's 1000 pounds 😏
One needs to learn how to take care of themselves before they can take care of others.
I know she has achieved a lot but I can't focus on anything other than the change in her forehead.
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT
Dude this is like that cliche with asking fat chicks how far they are in their pregnancy. This is literally that joke except she actually IS pregnant. God damn do I hope that baby makes it
She is looking great!! What a beautiful new life for her!  Also. Screw you Tammy.
PROPS AMY YOU LOOK AMAZING
If Amy can take care of Tammy... she can take care of a kid.

1:37 it damn sure is
I feel like Tammy is jealous. She’s made no recovery at all.
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
You know what they say “once you lose weight and get in shape, then thats when you get pregnant!”😆
Yo her fetus living in a mansion
Ahhhhhhhhhhh 😭🥺🤍. Go Amy!!!!!
Caraca Maluco.
Some people should not ne able to procreate.
Damn, imagine going to work every day to feed that.
#22 on trending wow
Watch the video i link in the reply! worth the watch. videos are posted everyone tuesday & Fridays
Ok so I’m the only asshole in the comment section eh
Ewww gross 🤢
Damn she def fuckin sat in a gas station bathroom for that to happen
I don't mess with shows like this. Not because it isn't entertaining or heartwarming, but this is our modern day version of a freak show. "Gather around everyone, lets watch a show about overweight sisters and see if they lose weight. Let's watch a show with little people and see if they fit in or not. etc. etc." Like why is this okay? Because they get paid to be on TV? Just my dumb opinion but I don't agree with the premise of sticking cameras into peoples lives for views just because they "different."
Yikes
Bless her
OH BOY
......         ⚆ ⚆        👄
I will now regularly say I’m serious as a heart attack

I just found out today that I’m pregnant too
I am so happy for her 😊
Don't be selfish and bring kids into existence against their will
This is all so sad
Man why wouldn’t you just adopt in this case and not carry on these gene pools?
Welp, there goes the neighborhood. Git rrrr done!
Good luck to her and baby. She’s going to be in a high risk pregnancy:( she’s going to have to take care of herself very good!
So the abortion is next episode I trust.
That baby will be on disability for sure
wow i made a song about this https://soundcloud.com/nocape/im-depressed-amys-pregnant
?
Vile
Omg she lost so much and now she is pregnant!? I’m so proud of her!
Gross.
I'm always happy to hear someone's having a baby. Wishing her a happy healthy baby. But in my & I mean my opinion TLC is exploiting these gals. I know they shared on YouTube but many of the videos didn't have a ton of views, more so now they've been thrown out for the world to laugh at & ridicule & it's sad.  If they were my daughter's which I have older than them there is no way  period, don't care even though their old enough to decide on their own. I always have & will have their best interest at heart & that wouldn't be on TLC . Yes I know they have chosen this platform for their "fans" and the payday/ dangling a carrot from TLC. But there's obviously issues beyond the weight loss journey. More so from Tammy that is apparent but it's sad to watch. If it's just about the weight loss TLC could of offered them a few part episodes like they did the 2 boys. I did watch a few episodes last season & again last night & honestly I have been tuning away from A lot of TLC's programming. Started with the Duggars, Honey Booboo & it's been a domino effect for me.  TIME TO GET REAL TLC.
Just saw this, and while still on the trending list there is chloe tings at #29
i am so.glad you are having a baby.
Amy looks so beautiful!! Proud of her loosing the weight to start the family she wanted
“Ok my life goal is complete, my baby got 100 upvotes on r/chonckers”
Why shouldn’t she be pregnant? Never seen the show so I’m lost.
That baby’s coming out the womb 150 lbs.
I thought tammy eas an Orca
Good to know that she lost a hella amount of weight makes me real proud of her
Ew. Some folks shouldn’t be allowed to procreate.
Happy for her however I hope she keeps her new healthy habits she is very high risk and continues to set a good example for her child!!!! Our child's health is very important just as ours it sadness me when I see children so young overweight with diabetes. Not good.
Hate the saying “we’re pregnant”
What does TLC stand for?
🐳
Who would impregnate that thing?
Listen to my melodies and your zozl llbehappy🥳👌
Она просто больной человек.
@ you peg
Amy is just the sweetest person every ahhhhhhhh
I wish her well her husband seems so nice.
I really cannot tell this lady's age seriously.
😭😭😭😭
Congrats!!!
proud of amy!!
I swear I thought she was in her 40's..
Gross
Shit these two are pro creating? The kid doesnt have a chance!
Who ever is reading this, God has a plan, trust the process💖
So happy she has a supportive husband
These TLC shows keep feeling more and more exploitative. TLC... more like The Side Show Channel... It's disgusting.
Ohhhhh Hell No, wonder how the Kid is going to turn out. My God.
Is she really pregnant? Or did she eat someone’s baby ?
hooe gets gets active and healthy or that child gonna have no mom by time the chil 5
I know that after the surgery it can be very dangerous for mom and baby. My friend had a similar surgery and doctors told her to wait a whole year to heal. I’m happy for them but understand why Tammy is worried, I hope for a healthy pregnancy. ❤️❤️❤️
Go vegan...it's possible during pregnancy
Dam didn't know meteors could walk
Congrats
Congratulations!!!! I’m so happy for y’all!!!! I lost 50lbs and got pregnant with my second child; just don’t take it as a license to eat WHATEVER!!! Because you want to keep as much weight off as possible gf!!! Tammy I’m proud of you too gf, you got it off before, you can do it again sweetie, then you can have your surgery!!! I’m praying for you girls!!!
Someone is jealous
Congratulations
disgusting.
Congrats to them!
🙏
I betcha no one knew till the baby popped out her being such a fat ass
🤣🤣 they should make this illegal that kid will be so bullied it’s just not fair on the kid a life of depression mixed with comfort eating just lovely😞
VISIT PLANNED PARENTHOOD
Happy for her
you can't help but smile and be happy for them. really hope everything ends up well
Congratulations GOD make no mistakes honey. GOD BLESS you on your new beginning

I'm like, 'Whut? (◉_◔)'
Hope they can both be healthy
I just so happy for you both you look great just take it easy look after yourself all the best to you and your husband love from canada
Amy: We're pregnant  Tammy: Bitch, please  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Question is who the hell would put inside her 😂. I could never lmao.
Here before 1 million views
Congratulations 🍾🎉🎈🎊
I think I speak for everyone when I say  .. ew
Jesus.
You can see she lost a lot of weight since her neck area shrunk, her eyes are wider and her face got smaller too. That hard work and motivation; she's been waiting for this to happen and I'm just so happy for Amy.
Poor kid is gonna have one shitty life
Awwwww I’m happy for her!!
Ew
Why glorify bad behavior.
How
Is it me or do they look related...
This is the downfall of the human race-- happening right in front of us.
That baby is going to have so many issues. How sad...
Dang amynois the hutt is having an offspring
I don't think anyone should be pregnant if they don't take the risk to themselves or their child seriously.. Like I'm hoping for the best but this could go seriously wrong. :(
These is wrong man people overweight should not have baby’s bad genes every where  baby is going two have so many health problems
I hope Tammy gets it together and stop relying so much on her sister .
Oh that’s disgusting
I’m so happy for you !!! Congrats ❤️❤️
Congratulations darling I’m so happy for you! I didn’t know she she was back?
They’re so mean to each other 😂
They’re so mean to each other 😂
Oh so happy for her hope in uncertain time prsying
So happy for you Amy congratulations!  I know you been wanting this for so long.
That’s the whole reason she wanted to lose weight... I’m so happy for her ❤️❤️
I wanna know who hit it
Congrats, now we can watch a hippo give birth on animal planet and TLC.
“I finally got to poop but there was a lil twist” bruh I’m dead ☠️
Please don’t subject another child to becoming obese asf
"I finally got to poop, but there was also  a little twist"
gross
Instantly grossed out.
Dude but romantically. But why is that me lmaoooo
Thats disgusting 🤮
I love her friend😩 Her:im pregnant Friend: bitch please
just abort it duh :D
That's disgusting
Holy Sh!t! Somebody hit that! L🤣L...
1:56 I have the power to at last to provide for my children thanks to this  look up on the internet for *f undailypa y*
Congrats!! Amy you look great good luck with your baby.
With her weight being that it is...it must’ve looked weird when they were being intimate. Damn, how old is she? Her & her husband look like they would have kids in college or high school.
Dang Tammy! You just shot Amy’s good news to hell
Time to get discovery plus + I guess 😅
Hopefully this pregnancy motivates her to lose weight
Amy! Girl! You are looking so so incredible. Omg! So many congrats. Love to see it.
This is actually a show? Like on TV? Like people want to watch this non-ironically?
Yayyy Amy 🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
wow. that's a development...
pig
https://youtu.be/0wkQRr365uk
Genuinely I would make a joke of this. But I will instead be happy for her.
This girl should’ve never gotten pregnant
I'm thrilled for Amy!!!!!!!!
How?
The shock on their faces says this wasn't planned. It was an accident. Getting pregnant so soon when told not to was probably not her intention.  At this point, it's too late to lecture about the precautions. We just need to keep our hopes up and Amy needs to follow doctors' orders closely. The more support she has the better.  I've never seen this show before, and only know what I do from the comments. I just hope all goes smoothly and peacefully from now on.
The baby's just gonna fall out, suffocate between her thighs and she'll never even notice
She wasn’t pregnant before!!!😱
Awesome! Hope y'all have a healthy baby!
So we are celebrating obesity now Poor unborn
That poor child
This will let her learn how good life can be I love her
Hopefully the baby survives with her ol big self. And hopefully it doesn’t turn out as big as they
Aww congratulations sweetheart I am so happy for you. You are looking great I haven't seen you for a while
They can't even take care of themselves. Much less a child
Gross
She’s lost so much weight 🥺  I’m so proud of her
That baby's gonna come out of the womb making bank from disability benefits with parents like those
Poor baby.
I hope she won't forget her baby in her hot car, like she did in the past with her dog
Congrats?
This is the reason Eugenics exists. In no world should someone with such shitty genetic material breed.
One can only try to understand an equal, judgement occurs from a pedestal ⭕️
Is she married to my sister???
Oh no! Reality is turning into Idiocracy !
Good grief that's a biggun!
Are they brother and sister?
0:19 *f u nda  ily pa y* is our explanation why everyday I am given 181
Omg.
Did she breed with an elephant?
No stop don't procreate
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up dear ones. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of Fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
You mean somebody actually 😱 the world frightens me at times.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Must've been by artificial insemination then, surely??????
Awww, I’m so happy for her! People watch this show to see how better they are than others, but this is just- 🥺 It’s so wholesome I love it!! I hope you stay safe, and healthy! 💚✨
I haven't watched the show but I hope it isn't glorifying obesity. It seems kinda cruel to be entertained by someone else's health issues.
I am so happy for her and her husband. This is such wonderful news, congrats,
I love how the whale is givin the smaller whale advice. Bitch u still look the same
how does someone that BIG even have the physical ability to get pregnant?( hard to find where to put it)
Must have been REALLY really really DRUNK sex
Who would f that
and the father is mcdonalds
Only the dumb people are having kids. This might be the first time in history that our collective IQ is going to start trending down.
how old is this person? bc she's pregnant but looks 45 at least.

Ew gross
LMFAO
WOW !!!! HOW DID THAT HAPPEN ???
First of all I didn’t even need to hear Tammys reaction,I already knew she wasn’t going to be happy for her sister. SHE wants to be Amys baby. Man,she knows what this means for herself.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
amy's sister looks like an ogar sorry, but i hope amys does well
It was meant to be
Just saying what most are thinking....that poor poor child...and how did the guy get "ready enough" for Amy?
Stay eating healthy hun love ya girl
Congrats so happy 4 y'all
Wowww she’s lost so much weight !!
Aaw so awesome!!! 💜☺💜
Check out my book on my channel
I see that Tammy is still selfish and shitty as always.
Aw I'm so freaking happy for them. God bless. I hope the baby is healthy and they get healthier too along the way. Omg. Adorable.
Aww so happy for Amy
I'm so proud and happy for Amy she found a husband, lost weight,and now about to have a child
The one episode I miss, it turns out it was the best one😮🤭omg😁
now shes putting the baby at risk. they do it to themselves. this makes no since 4 months ago surgery and you are trying to have a kid? talk about bad judgment, I am proud of her weightloss and everything but at least wait till you are fully healed and safe. don't just go doing what you wanted like you did before. you see how that turned out for them
Baby finna be 50lbs
How
😝 🤮
Wow she’s lost so much weight I’m so happy for her
Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! He's coming very soon! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross 2020 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! He is our peace in these troubling times. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
I don't see it. A person needs to be healthy to carry a baby along with raising one .
WOW!!! Amy lost soooo much weight!! I’m so happy and proud of her! ❤️
I’m just praying for the baby’s sake
Amy's husband was soo happy!!
I'm happy for them ! Tammy sounds jealous I hope amy has a healthy pregnancy 🥰
At first I was upset with Tammy for her negative reaction to Amy's pregnancy, but she seems concerned for her health and safety more than anything. This time Amy's actually right, it was too soon, saying that though, I hope the pregnancy is healthy and goes smoothly.
i’m not crying i’m not crying i’m not crying
What is it  pregnant with?
AMY LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT holy shit I stopped watching for a bit I'm literally tearing up she wanted to be a mom and have a family CONGRATS OH MY GOD
Her sister seems concernedly jealous.  She know she's not fine be able wait on her every five minutes with a baby.  This may force her to do things by herself and loose more weight tho.
I’m so happy for her omg she looks great and she’s doing amazing 💜💜
i feel like a proud mom i'm so happy fr them  amy i hope your baby is healthy and strong, best of luck🥺
My mom had the same thing had my brothers back to back they came out healthy. My mom was over 500lbs but she had to be on bed risk it wasnt an easy preganacy for either boys both came out 10lbs and kicking
Did they really abuse animals?
Wow!!!am so proud of her, awesome God.his faithfulness is forevermore
Amy if you're reading this, Remember you can do this. Many of us have and will change for the better. I'm praying for y'all.  Hugs
Damn I haven’t check on the sisters in so long I didn’t even recognize her with all the weight loss! She’s on such an upward trajectory
Congratss!!!
Her sister is just jealous and she's super toxic
Wow Amy looks great , and she seems so much happier and now she’s gonna be a mom
Congratulation, Amy!!! 🎊🎉🎈
I think she will be a great mom. She has a good heart.
*Amy running her pregnancy in the ground, we get your pregnant but geez... This will be her excuse not to do anything, smh... **#shesaged*
I am happy  for Amy. She will  make a good mom. I see how she treats her little doggie.
Congrats, Tammy you are going to be a good mother and you look so much healthier
American beauty

I’m very happy that Amy is pregnant! Hope she is happy, healthy, & safe. Best wishes! Amy can make the choice she wants.

Well here goes Tammy still as over weight and negative as always.
I'm so proud of her!! Congrats amy!!
Cmon tlc keep feeding me with these uploads
How did she not realize LOLOL
As much as I am happy for them, I feel sad for the kid, because If this mom doesn’t get in shape they will be doing most of the work.
“Bitch please” is a reaction I wish I would’ve gotten lmao 😂
That sister is a hater!!!!!
👍👍👍👍🥺🥺🥺🥺👏👏👏👏Keep it up. Your doing great
I hope she keeps up the great Work! 💜💜
Congratulations
Congratulations to her
Tammy starting to get on my nerves

I just threw up 🤮 !!
Too soon ? They married let her be happy
oh my god! so happy for her!!! this is her sign to stay on the right path so that she can be healthy so that she can raise her baby 😊
I like how she says “we’re pregnant” instead of “I’m pregnant” 😂
That's so mean. Why would you be so mean 🤦🏽‍♀️.  She can be healthy and carry her baby.
Im so happy for her🥳🙏❤
Don't watch the show but I'm happy for her and hopes she has a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby.
I am so happy for her..she is a inspiration to everyone...dont lose hope and focus in your goal
Cool beans
That's beautiful
I’m happy for her. 😀
Lmao I'm 12 and I watch this  😂😂
Congratulations praying for a healthy baby
Dude 🤣😂
She has lost so much weight..So cool
tammy doesn’t seem happy for her at all
Wow she looks amazing
Who here seen the movie idiocracy? You know where I'm going with this
😭😭😭😭I'm so happy for her
I'm so happy for her.... she's kind and gentle.
Disgusting she had to add in that she finally got to poo
Google the word cretinism.
OMG💗💗💗that’s amazing
she looks so much better now. im so proud of her!
Yikes holy shit that's scary
omg
Bless that baby's heart
Good for her😍
I have a bad feeling about this
Tammys not happy that Amy’s pregnant bcuz she’s going to have to do things herself as she’s used to getting things done for her. She should see it as a perfect timing to get her damn self moving around loosing weight 😒
Congrats to Amy ❤️❤️❤️ your gonna be such a good mommy
Tammy WOW come on
Omg I’m so happy I remember when u we’re 600 pounds about u and ur man evened it
yay im so happy for her!! shes been working hard and im so proud she finally got what she wanted
There is cause for concern because her body's still healing from surgery but Tammy's comment doesn't sound like it's coming from a place of genuine concern. She sounds just like their mother, constantly dragging them down.
Happy new year 🥳🥳 I have great respect and admiration for yourself & Tammy!!!  Congratulations on baby 🍼🐥.... Prayers, peace love & compassion. On my behalf of like to apologise for the hateful messages and unacceptable things sent to Tammy.. & Amy..  Peace love & compassion Namaste 🌾 Debbie
Estamos viendo tu maraton en H&H TE AMAMOS.
SO HAPPY FOR YOU I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU
Congratulations 👣 i am so happy for amy she deserves  this happiness  this is God's  way of smiling down on amy she has had enough heartbreak it's  not easy to lose weight and keep it off
I enjoy your program. Good luck to you both with your weight loss. I hope for the best for you both. Thank you for going public with your weight loss.
She just thought maybe she couldn't have kids or ot would this easy

Congratulations on you having a baby with you both a happy life

😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🛡
Oh Jesuu....imagine being her OB?  What a nightmare!  I’ve worked in OB offices!  She’d go straight to a high risk perinatologist!
Get healthier for that baby, both of you!!!!!!!! 🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼
I LITERALLY GASPED AFTER READING THE TITLE AND CLICKED SO FAST
Oh my God!!! Soo happy for you guys!!!❤❤❤
Why would they reproduce, more spwans  from hell
I’m happy for her ❤️
Is it similar to a pap test to determine your pregnant?
I'm happy for her..but I do deep down can't help but think this was a tactical move to keep her TLC show going. You know they're going to film every second of her pregnancy.
happy for them ..just cannot wait to see the whole show
Is there a season 2
Awe 💛 congrats!
How will she eat for 2 with a smaller post op stomach hmmm
She looks so good!!! Hopefully this’ll be a positive change in her life x
Wow
Cute
I really do hope she has a safe pregnancy and delivery.
Men will f*ck.... ANYTHING!!!
I’m so happy for her!
good for her!!
Oh dear.  What else can you say.  Pity any poor child who is born into that.  I realise this comment is not very pc, let's face it, you can only say these days the right thing that is not supposed to upset anyone.  However, these shows are only put out there as entertainment for the masses, a bit like going to see the fat lady at the freak show in the circus before tv and social media came into being.  I obviously don't wish any harm on her or the baby (if it is true) but it is difficult to really buy into any of this dramatised and scripted crap.
“We’re pregnant”   Hold up, wait a minute?
Damn, I can’t even get any lovin’ 😭
My mom is also pregnant
That baby gonna be born with 400lb
I wanna see where tammy is at
What’s crazy is the baby has definitely been born by now. Or really really soon
She is jealous.
Congratulations 🍾
2021 is already something else, congrats to Amy 💞🥂
I am so happy for you two. I'll know you'll make wonderful parents.
Im soo proud of her she gorgeous 💜💜💜💖💙🤰😁✨✨✨
Aww. Congrats!!
Congrats to her! I remember from an older video she shared one of the reasons she wanted to change her health was to start a family. Hopefully everything turns out safe and healthy :)
Is the baby ok
Amy learns she's gonna die
Aww im so happy for her!!!!!💜
🎊💃🏼💫🎉🎈🎉💃🏼🎊💫🎉🎈🎊💃🏼🎈💫
I'm praying she has a safe pregnancy.
Ew disgusting
She has lost so much weight
Tammy cant feel happy for her
Where's Dustin?? If you know you know
CONGRATULATIONS! ♡
I’m happy for Amy, I bet she’ll be a great mum
I’m so happy for her❤️
Congratulations
The butt hurt is real
Said i am happy for you sister hello
Many people watched this show and think these people are actually kind/ goodhearted people. They are not! They did awful things. Fraud and animal abuse. I believe some people shouldn't be allowed to have children and these people are one of them. When you can barely take care of yourself you shouldn't be allowed to take care of a child.
Oh wow she looks so good!
Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m going to cry for her! ❤️ Keep up the work sister 🤗
Felicidades por su bebé 👏💗
Amy looks so good!! I'm so happy for her
Amy has done good, she’s bettered herself enough and I hope she stays on that track. Tammy needs to now help herself
I feel sorry for that kid's gene pool.
Congratulations!💚
Im so happy for her! I just hope they are both safe, considering this could be a little risky.
No way! I’m so happy for Amy she deserves this so much!                   Congratulations Amy!
I’m sooooo happy for them yayyyy
Man how much flour do those two have to use to find the wet spot in the first place.
Congratulations Amy.  I know you love your sister but I would not want the example she would set around my kid.  Tammy acts horrendously selfish sometimes and weight has nothing to do with it.
Tammy is not jealous
I am so happy for them! She is looking so good!
I love Amy & Tammy :O)
Congrats!!!
She is concern not jealous
Aw God bless. Congrats!
That was not nice tammy you should be happy she's doing good and be proud you'll be an aunt there's nothing i wouldnt do for my nephews and nieces and their all so good to me as well be happy and a good aunt❤✌
She said bitch plz 😂
Eat healthy madam and protect the baby 👶
A normal pregnancy announcement for once 😂
He not that excited when he ask are you serious? Lol
Congratulations ❤️
Hopefully her and the baby will be okay..
All the people here that say how wonderful Tammy and Amy are...umm watch some of their old videos. These woman are not little darlins..  Btw she and Michael got together when she was 8 YEARS OLD. Sad but true...
Poor kid!
Wooooottttttt!!!! Go Amy!!!!! I'm so happy  for you
Congratulations I'm excited as if it was my pregnancy lol.
...and i can't even get a text back SMH...
She has made such an improvement in her health ! She’s looking great 😊
Holy crap fatty is pregnant
Hope the pregnancy goes ok.. it will be really hard on her body
Yay!
Beautiful 🥰❤️
Omg I am so happy for her xx
Omggg she’s lost so much weight!! So proud of her
Tammy  shut  it.... just  me happy
I couldn’t be anymore happier for her!!!!
There’s a reason doc told her to wait
smh...tammy should have been more supportive
Congratulations!!
She should t have a baby right now. She’s not healthy enough imo. They should’ve took precautions to make sure she didn’t get pregnant.
I’m soo happy for youuuuuu😭😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
“I think they need to go check it again “  Lol too cute 💕
Congratulations to you and your family ❤️💙
I didn’t know they made a second season!!!
I’m so happy for her because she’s been wanting a kid for a long time.
🌹🌹💋💋
Man I'm so proud of her progress
And there's the Green Eyed Monster rearing its Ugly Head,  Tammy  ! God Forbid she congratulated her sister.  Typical Tammy  !!
Congratulations to her for getting pregnant but didn't the doctors highly recommend she not get pregnant for at least two years because of her recent weight loss and it could be high risk health issues?
Who tf will get her pregnant no offense
Aww I’m so happy for her💞💞
That was such a messed up thing to say Tammy. Because of her size and situation I'm sure it's a high risk pregnancy but I dont think it is her health that makes Tammy say this, I think she is just jealous of her sister.
I don't think Tammy's necessarily jealous. Even Amy knew she shouldn't have gotten pregnant yet because it's too soon. Oh well ig it's what she wanted anyway❣
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉
You can tell he's a good man
Congratulations Amy I'm so happy for you and your hubby I know it's too soon but if you guys do it right you can have a beautiful baby I know you can do it be team strong keep healthy and God will bless you with a beautiful child because it happened to me the same thing I had to make sure I was going to have a little girl and I made them check for times I have faith in you and so does God!!🎉🎉💙💜💙🙏
Tammy is just jealous that her sister is making progress and is starting to enjoy her life again and be happy. Tammy has shown multiple times that she isn't as committed as Amy to losing weight.
Oh my that's a big baby 🍼!
Good god damn!
So ur telling me that she wasn't pregnant before!?
I fear for that child. Michael molested Amy when she was a child & they've neglected so many animals. They should not have kids.
Her sister is a bit jelly i think
I love that she’s posting all these on her YouTube before tlc 😂
“I wish he was lying to you” girl what? she has wanted a kid for a very long time.
How old is she? I thought she was like 45+
Why is everyone so happy about this? She was supposed to wait at least 2 years! Very irresponsible. Unbelievable!!
How did they make a baby??? Think about that
I freakin love Amy ❤️❤️❤️ she’s so funny and happy, really proud of how much weight she’s lost
Congratulations!🥳❤
WooooooooW...Her sister is a hater! I understand her concern but damn!
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎈!! Amy!! You will be a great mom and continue your incredible healthy journey xoxo 😘
Congratulations! But stay healthy .
Scammer
Hold up everybody did she change her mans or he gained weight ??
Congratulations to them. They're so excited ♥️
Everyone has their opinion about Tammy, but i seen a clip that Amy was supposed to wait 2 years out from surgery, to get pregnant. So it may be more of a concern than being a hater/jealous of Amy
Tammy is super toxic
If she was pregnant she would obviously know how to make it
0:39 I died 🤣🤣😂😂
Wow. So sad. She can't take care of herself and has poor decision-making qualities.  Poor baby.
I'm so happy for her honestly the blessing of a baby can really change someone either for the best or for the worst 💕💕💕 i can't help but to smile let's hope she continues to keep up her new food habits and pass them down to the new baby
Wow! Great news for them!
Wow so so proud of her weight loss! Welldone girl all the way from the uk!
The husband gain weight 😳
Ayye love the show congratulations
She’s come so far, I pray she keeps up her great work! ❤️🥰 God bless
She couldn’t even begin to eat enough nutrients to actually get enough nutrients for herself and her baby. Nutrients are not stored in the fat cells. The babies going to suffer. Most likely she’ll lose it.
Congratulations 🎉 I’m happy for her. Her sister not being happy wasnt surprising to me though lol
