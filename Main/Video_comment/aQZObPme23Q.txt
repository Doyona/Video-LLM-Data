“White hand don’t you ever respond to another voice over here”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So grateful for Kevin’s translation 😭😭😭

This little black dude has tattoos all over… are they still as expensive since he’s so tiny and black
This hit different knowing he hang with Diddy..😂😂😂

Miller Lisa Harris Anthony Thomas Shirley

They both are goofy lmao
😂😂😂😂
Agh. It’s like hot ones
Lynch is cool af
Lmao.  “That white hand come handy man.”
Hey My favorite NFL nephew Marshawn Lynch.  I actually met him last year I cooked him some food here in Las Vegas. He is one of the coolest people I have met in person.
Marshawn Lynch.....Superbowl champ.....and flip cup champ......a man of many talents.
I love how Marshawn dodged the question about throwing it on the one. He didn't blame anyone but still answered how he felt about it.
I thought a bando was an abandoned house
Beast mode 😤😤
Anyone that noticed they put XLVII instead of XLVIII  👇
@11:47 physical comedy that good just cant be taught. That was amazing.
I am CRYING over Marshawn "flipping" those cups 🤣
1-yard play is more memorable than the Super Bowl win
Damn kev im as white as it gets and i knew what a bando was 😂
Kev needs kat next .......
Is there a story about the heart necklace Kevin is wearing? I've seen it multiple times on this show, maybe he explained it on one of those "on the ice" shows?
Gotta market the Lynch
Who is "his people"? Americans?
Best episode ever
The fact Kevin is standing up in the tub is crazy 😂
Kevin definitely got this idea from Hot Ones 😂
Why he spit that ish out and almost puke like dat tho 😂
Marshawn litteraly didn't flip the cups 😂
I would serve Marsha en at earls in Bellevue all the time
Marshawn is so fantastic and Kevin's reactions were so funny, his interpreting 🤣🤣🤣🤣
just a QUALITY thumbs up from White Hand.. dude gets it.
Lynch made up his own language.
Kevin laughing hysterically at Lynch's unpreparedness for Buffalo was hilarious.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like how lynchh changed topic real quick at 2:58 😂😂😂😂
I love Marshawn ❤
😅😅
Marshawn is a hoot. Love his g.a.f. attitude. Love it.
❤fort lauderdale gym jobzx!@
The hat over the towel is killing me till this day 😂
He did technically Flip the cups lol
Marshawn talks as a hood The West Coast side black brother and Kevin talks like a nerdy corny black guy that’s the difference where you can tell them apart from the voice see how hart keeps saying ice land ice town forgetting until Lynch gotta keep reminding him! lol
Kevin hart is the goat
I love my son… I had texted in his name to watch the interview and low and behold. Kevin Hart is a fool. He’s so funny oh my Lord.
It’s not real ice
How Kevin Hart don’t know what a band is
Not Iceland, CA 😂😂😂
GET STONE COLD AND TRIPLE H ON THE SHOW
What was In the cups ?
Kudos to Kevin Hart for breaking down the bay area lingo. Much appreciated to both Beast and Hart 💯🙏
Kevin Hart is actually sexy as hell
This dude dipped his feet in the water with his damn socks on 0:51 😂😂😂
Poor Lenny😂😮😅😅
Marshawn is that guy.. ❤❤
Marshawan took that shirt off......THANK YOU
I love Marshawn Lynch energy
The Bay Area created bookoo slang shout to my favorite rapper the hillbilly Earl “Mr Flamboyant “ Stevens.
I like how Kevin did the clap and beast mode gave props.
White hand you excited?! 👍🏼 😭. And Kevin’s necklace 💀
Iceland😂😂😂
He got in wit his socks on🤦🏾‍♀️ now I wonder what his feet look like. I would love for him to meet my son. He seems so cool
The C4 scene was too funny he couldn’t stand Kevin hart 🤣🤣🤣
Marshawn is the funniest athlete ever.
6:50 bruh he couldn’t be more wrong lol sleep mean I didn’t know I wasn’t  paying attention I was sleep on it lol (4 my yt people)
Marshawn. Marry me.❤
Lmaooo Kevin translating Marshawn’s story for the melanin-deficient 😭😭😭😭
Marshawn the MF beast!
Why Kevin wearing the necklace Rose threw into the ocean?
Marshawn Lynch is one of the funniest dudes while not trying to be funny which makes it even funnier.😂
Dat C4 crap is nasty
I think Wanye might pull A Different World😂😂😂 IYKYK
Ain't anybody threw a hand that looked invisible
The hair nigha moment outside.and the one with the fet mind
After hearing Marshon speak I’m not sure any reporters would’ve even be able to get any words they could understand out of him
Naw it ain't you got scared by the undertaker
the black clap vs white clap had me dying
Flip cup part lmao
Marsha an lynch is funny ash
I gotta pay some bills WHITE HAND lol marshawn dieing in the back
Lol my favorite one so far
Marshawn is everything!
Wuz haaanan
💥 NORTH POLE! ICE CITY! NSO💥
10:10 shouldve taken kev to all his media obligations ever
cold tub tactics  3:20
As a Bay Area native I understood every word that man said 😂
They didn’t give Marshawn the ball because he was a rebel and the suits did not want him to be the hero that won the superbowl. That is the truth. They had to have been told to not give the ball to him purposely.
Kevin is standing up in the tub
EXCLUSIVE
I’m from Detroit and i understood Beastmodes slang 😂😂😂
Bra got in the ice with socks on lol
I Believe beast mode use to be gang member 😂
Beast mode cuz😈
Im watching a fortnite video yet this title and comment section is popping up. Wtf youtube? 😂
To me he reminds me of Iverson in football
Kevin knows his people though dude take notes
“Ima be honest. That was the first time I have been scared on the show” 😂
😂
We need an episode with bambam and Darrel in the tub
That white hand coming in handy 😂🤣
I’m Oakland born and raised, I forget how colorful our lingo is 😂
Beastmode!
❤❤❤❤❤
AAVE for ya 🤣🤣
One of my favorite episodes
Kev: Every one of color clap 2 times  Marshawn: 👏🏾👀?
Marshawn proves he's still the realest MF in sports
Dude, I didn’t understand a word Marshawn story
I don’t believe that’s a real ice bath
I love these shows! 😂😂😂
Can't complete a sentenced without a bleep...
The most funny episode ever
When kevin hart sat all the way down i crieddddd 6:18
Could you imagine the crying and whining if two white guys had a “black hand” 😂😂   The world would implode
I think you could probably have an award winning travel show with these two.
This is the best episode to date
WHERE’S BLACK HAND KEV? THIS YO LAST DAY -FEB 28 2023
I love beastmode great interview
Love this interview. Marshawn is way cooler than I knew. :)
Translating the slang is crazy 🤣
The oakland translation is hilarious
It don’t get no realer than Marshawn lynch 😂100% authentic too fucking funny.
6:17 the man almost drowned 😂
That HEY BRAD moment was Kevin hart samurai move, ensnared the BEAST into comedic happiness
How can you top this
The “you got it cousin?” Made me die laughing
The Realist episode Yet!
You hear the staff laughing in the background when he jumped out the tub 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone ripping off Hot Ones these days, even millionaire comedians.
Do Dennis Schroeder
It kills me watching every episode knowing kevin can't sit down in the tub 😂😂
We definitely needs RDC on this and their skit about Marshawn after the interception
I'm a Seahawks season ticket holder who still wears #24 to every game. Marshawn is the GOAT. I'll happily be your white hand!
Did anybody else know exactly what a bando meant when he said it? 😂
That flip cup moment TOOK ME OUT 😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Enjoyed this interview but the interview be to damn short. Can you make longer interviews?
Marshawn the goat!
Clone Kevin wayyyyy to white
When you figure out they was taking shots cause of marshawn reaction and Kevin hart face 😂😂😂😂
Marshawn: "I did flip it"🤣
aint no way dude went in with his socks
He said "I can't even think rn my feet😩" kev : "that's what I wanted"
Ice Land 🧊  Ice Town ❄️  🤣😂🤣😂
That’s not ice water. Those plastic floaties as in fake ice
He did flip it 😂
Typo on the super bowl, supposed to be XLVIII
Kevin and Marshawn have the eyes brighter 😂😂 💨💨💨
New conspiracy, i think the ice is fake and the water is warm. There I said it
Beast mode been eating good in the thumbnail I thought it was Maui from Moana.
🤣🤣Marshawn trying to call white hand and white hand not responding 🤣🤣
Lmfao 😂
Wtf is the point of a cold tub interview?
That dope he explained that moment 😂
Dawg, 11:50 got me rollin! 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Kev is a dickhead dawg!
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
So I was told, this is pretty much fake.  This is Luke warm water, with ice floating on top.  Even the thermometer is pre-set and never changes. Notice when they go in, they never bristle, which is an autonomous response, even when conditioned to cold
6:07 had me dying 😂🤣
This was hilarious 😂 🤣
Bruhh... the C4 part (12:00) had me dying!!! 💀😂😂😂😂😂
Hey Brad !!
Running back goat 🐐
No lie I understood what Marshawn said more than what Kevin was saying
11:58 …🤣😂😅🥲
I love  me some Marshawn he is just himself and I love that you can’t get that from most people.
He tried to call the white hand and couldn’t . Lmao
Marshawn is so cool
Marshawn was like "you good at this"! Then he went on to school Kevin! He was the one who told Kev to go in!
kevin explaining all that bay area lingo is sumn lmaoooo
lol these guys, stop stalling & get in😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😅 12:16
I know good and well he didn’t get in with his socks lmaoo
“Hey Brad!” 😂😂😂

Sleep ment he wasn't prepared,that he didn't know about Buffalo weather..

I love Oakland as a matter fact I’m moving there
Hilarious 🤣😂🤣
Marshawn like snoop wen he talk u listen 💯👂
Yo this entire interview had me dyin! I lost it when he spit the C4 out in the tub 😂😂😂😂
Bring Marshawn back. Please 🙏.
Is it true this show is fake? Like it’s not cold water at all? So many people have exposed this.
Love him ❤
Us Bay Area natives different 💯💯😂

It’s good seeing Marshawn open up
Just let Marshawn talk.  He's the funniest dude ever.  Kevin translating and laughing at what he says is the icing on the cake.
🤣🤣🤣
clear plastic fake ice in warm water
Kevin would drown if he doesn’t hold himself up
No one talking bout how he had his socks on 😂
Marshawn in the woods with Bear Gill was hilarious....watch it if you haven't,
Marshawn funny as a mofo
Lol ouch
He ain’t like the C4😂
Kevin did a great job with the translation from English to English
When Marshawn started choking I died 😂😂😂😂
Kevin is forever hilarious
By far the best episode ever!!!! 😂😂
This man got in with his socks still on. Man after my own heart. 🤣🤣🤣
I think I tore a muscle in my stomach off that C4 segment.  😂😂😂😂😂

not beast mode calling kevin hart blood . now i cant unsee it
I love that there is prob people that got use outta that translation ish😂😂😂😂
They didn’t want a black man to be the face of the NFL even if that meant losing. That’s what they hinting on but won’t say that in fear of repercussions.
This is one of the best episodes to date! I felt like I was watching stand up Kev. 😅
Marshawn choked 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are we gonna ignore that beast mode did this white his socks on?
Ride along three should have Marshawn in it, that'll be dope
This the best episode I swear 😂

Mano só de olhar para ele você já começa a rir sem parar 😂 cara o Kevin é foda😂😂😂😂
Has Marshawn Lynch ever given a bad interview?? Even when was trying not to get fined! This dude is Media GOLD!! Keep doing your thing Beast Mode!
11:50 🤣🤣🤣
ML is a real one
Best one ever!
Get a like for diversity! Ok now you get a sub for the Airplane Jive routine! Still looking for Barbara.
Marshawn Lynch is hella disciplined.. Have to be, to sit in ice water, at ease... Mind over Matter at its finest...
Kevin oh his knees this whole video is taking me 😂😂😂😭😭😭
I am embarrassed to admit i was stalkin the seahawks out side that resort on i 10 and baseline out here in phoenix 😆
"He cracked his bip in the whip... means he wanted to open his drink in the car... CAUSE HE WANTED TO DRINK IT." 🤣  Ey but jokes aside... thank you very much Kevin Hart for being the street interpretor for Marshawn Lynch.
Dddd
Kevin Hart pausing for translation is a mess lol

Kevin put the towel and hat on his head: I feel better already.. It's hot in here: Kevin Hart (Sarcasm) facial Expression like no it's not 😂😂😂😂😂
Kevin!!! Please stop rhe ice baths. Apparently Times now has reported and discovered that cold showers are causing heart attacks in young healthy people.. the last 2 years apparently ice baths and cold showers have become fatal is some cases. Something people have been taking within the past 2 years is causing heart attacks. Apparently its showering.  The vax has nothing to do with it. So be super careful we can't lose a top 15 comedian we need comedy we need to laugh especially right now.  With all the child Predators in the were house and house and senate. In schools also 181 teachers have been arrested for assaulting kids. It's a dark dark world right now and the country is crumbling before our eyes. We need things to laugh about.
180 bottles of henny, that’s a lot
Gotta get Jordan Poole or Juan Toscano-Anderson or any of the warriors on here (ik Juan isn't on the team anymore but he should still do a interview with him
OOOOAAAAKLLLLAAAAAND YEEEEEEEE
Socks!?!??
He just put the cups upside down 😂
I'm a Broncos fan, thus I should hate M.Lynch but I love him every time I see him. You took a SB from us, you're a Raider.......I would buy you a drink in a second!.
U guys know that these ice cubes are fake?
Beast mode the only one who made hart go all the way in the cold tub
Bro this shid was crazy
I would like to chill with lynch for a weekend and just party
Marshawn. I'm Not a fan of the ice!!   Talk to them king!  Pls

Flip cup
I'm starting to think the water isn't cold and the ice is fake. Lol
Don’t let them see the weight. Hahah. This is the greatest show ever!
Marshawn is still a g even when he chokes 😂
Whyd he keep his socks on
This fool Marshawn really got socks, a wife beater and a towel in his shorts out here hahahahahahaha
Let’s be real, they didn’t give him the ball because they knew it would have been mvp. He is not the “professional” they want him to be.
It’s hella funny being from bay I knew what he talking and Kevin was translated what he what he was talk about
These videos are hilarious!!! To everyone reading this, Jesus loves you.
This is where Kevin Heart shines. He’s a situational comedic genius.
I knew
a real legend right there
He ain’t take off his socks 😂
Marshawn got in with SOCKS
Mark my words Marshawn is gonna be one of the biggest voices in sports TV in about a year or 2.  Fox sports or ESPN or YOUTUBE. 💪🏾💪🏾
Hey Brad 👋
Come on Beastmode show more love for Buffalo they drafted you. Look at them now.
Marshawn hella funny being from Oakland my self I knew everything he was saying
This is the first time watching this and I’m SURE this is my favorite one LOL!!
This is without question the funniest interview on Cold as Balls I have ever watched.
Marshawn was there just for White Hand. He love that crap. Should've let em have his moment with White Hand when he called for it.
"Hey Brad!" HAHAHAHA
He had his bip in the whip when he ran over that person on chippewa street when he was playing in Buffalo and kept going
Yeah!
I understood none of that
"I did flip it"...🤣🤣🤣🤣
Marshawn the coolest dude ever man
This is the best ad C4 ever put out
Wayyyy too many quotable moments it’s almost criminal 🤣🤣
Get joe burrow on here
I wish he would asked Marshawn if he think he could still play and if he wud if the right team called him.
Ice City like AJ
Great question Kevin ! Because I always wanted to know about that play at the 1 yd line !!!  WTF happened to give it to beast mode ? TF ? Should have known , bc Pete came from USC 🤦🏽‍♀️
“Iceland to be exact” 😂😂
Keep it 100 chickenhawks Disney made the call Marshawn can not set foot into the magic Kingdom I am going to let you take it from there.

Kevin, Marshawn, Snoop🤔 Olympics?
72 CASES of Henry😶😶

He said send some warning shots or something…

12:01 Kevin heart reminds me of kai cenat
This was my favorite Cold as Balls episode,  funny as hell.
Already know this one was gonna be funny marshawn lynch !!!
Ok so i live in the desert. 99-107 degrees. Right now it's not to bad around 103. July comes it will hit 107. So i have to take ice bathes. My body just keeps the heat and you know that feeling after you run a mile? Your body is just a heater. I feel that way for 1-2 hours after going inside a cool building. Which means i have to take ice bathes. When i do....i get this crazy high after i warm up from it. I'll pass tf out. Idk about you guys but i love it. You should try it. Freeze like 5  x 1gallon water bottles and just drop them with the cap open in your tub half full. It helps you sleep AND it helps your mood. It hurts so much but you get used to it. It's a serious high though. Maybe it's not a high but you get so sleepy like the feeling of being realllly sleepy and you nod off but then you get to lay down finally and that feeling of laying down. That's the feeling you get after you warm up from an intense ice bath. It feeeels sooo nice. Try it out guys.
Marshawn Lynch talking about Henny Kevin Hart pulling out a C-4 energy drink 😂😂😂😂 These 2 need to do more skits
😂😂😂
Lmbo....Why did Lynch use full size towels to stuff his pants & kevin used small towels 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀

2:05 in and I done spit my fkn coffee out already 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Correction: “I was sleep” does not mean he was pissed. “I was sleep” means he was Sleeping on (under estimated) how cold it can get in Buffalo.
Do Vince Staples!

Who don’t know a band is $1000😂 I hate Kevin so much😂😂😂😂
One of a kind man !! We will never see another Marshawn lynch !! NFL couldn’t have a inner city person like him MVP of a super bowl ! White folks wasn’t going for that ! Gave it to Brady instead facts !!

I love Marshawn. I use to always skate through Oakland and I'd always see him in downtown. He's one down to earth dude, but he's also ready for dat action. lol
need sean evans on here and call it cold ones
So 6 seasons and nobody is talking about how Kevin stole the premise of this show from having an appearance on “Hot Ones”? Ok 🙄
Seahawks should’ve ran the ball
Did He Get In With His Socks On🫣🤣🤣🤣

🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
“ C’mon blood “ hood can never leave 😂❤️

Heem = Hennessy
Shout out to Kev for translating.  I was very confused in this episode.  Learned alot.  Can't wait to try some of my new found knowledge out tomorrow at work.  Its ON!!!!
It threw me off when he said rushed for a Bando, in the south we refer Bando as an abandoned home with boarded windows (Trap House)
Very nice vedio
Nah when he told each race to clap 🤣🤣
Kevin Hart corny af. Money and jokes for white people don’t make you great

Getting in the tube with socks on is crazy
We got a section called Ice City in Philly too ... that's the hood Freeway and Peedi Crakk from and where they did the flip side video ..
like it.
That C4 hit harder than the Ice Bath...😂😂😂😂
You got a OG in the building shout out to Marshawn lynch 💯💯💯
6:53 sleep doesn’t means pissed . It means yo get caught slippin , or unaware.
I can’t believe ppl takes ice baths. I can’t even take a cold shower. I need my water hot .
I don't know who's doing the writing and proofreading in that show but Marshawn never won SB 47, he won 48, that's X, L V and 3 Is, not 2. (XLVIII)
Hey Brad 😭
Mane said this white hand coming in handy😭🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love me some Marshawn.... keeps it 100 and true to himself!!
First time I’ve ever got scared on cold as balls 😭😭😭
a bando is a trap
“I think you’re supposed to flip it”  “…i did flip it😐”
I met Lynch random as hell walking down Hollywood with Marcus Peters once. He’s a true character and really is like that all the time lol
LOLOL. Marshawn has to be the best interview out there. I am crying!
Easily on of my favourite episodes!
This has to be the best one yet hahahaha

Kevin issa unique mf 💀
Super awkward but,  I ALWAYS LOVE to see Marshawn🥰🥰
This the first time I seen Marshawn and Kevin together. Marshawn just vibes with everyone 😂
The flex made me choke and sent me into a coughing fit, just like Marshawn
Kevin is standing in there I am crying
That’s prop ice😂
JR Smith getting the "HennyGod" title when this man is the true HennyGod!
When Lynch scared some bip out his whip 😂 also he made every race clap LOOOOOOOL it was hella loud for the white ppl. The funniest episode that I’ve watched so far.
Two of my favorites! Lol!!
I'm not hating but I am not a Kevin Hart fan as a comedian but I love the show
This guy is crazy
I wonder Marshyn rock with bearfaced
Where were the fat white and skinny black security guys?
The funniest episode to date
Did he get into the tub with his socks on? 🧐🥴😟
White ✋ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I always thought Kev would have warm water with the fake ice cubes..lol
Kevin almost drowned in the tub lmao
I lost it when Marshawn spit out that C4 lmao On another note, I have a little story to tell. I actually met Marshawn a few years back while he was with the Raiders. He was in Palm Springs and I was a promoter for a local nightclub. We had a Taco Tuesday typa night goin at this club at the time and I'll never forget the time Marshawn Lynch popped up to the club on a random Tuesday night lol I remember he came thru completely solo too. No security, no entourage, nothin. He was cool as can be too! He just kept ordering his Henny by the glass and was chillin at a table for an hour or so. I remember the buzz in the club once the word had spread that Marshawn Lynch was in the building. We all made sure he had his space and no one bothered him. I actually took a minute to approach him and introduce myself and just tell him I'm a fan and he was super cool and shook my hand. Marshawn Lynch went to a club on a Tuesday night in Palm Springs by himself 😂 Good times.
Marshawn is a national treasure!
Thank you Kevin Hart for acting as the interpreter 💯👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Cracked open that Heem
Omg I love marshawn 😫
Priceless 😂🤣
Black hand out here crawling around looking for reparations for some ish that don’t exist.
Marshawn has always given me Mike Tyson vibes
Straight menace for keeping the socks on 💀
Missed opportunity. C4 definitely has skittles flavors
This episode is amazing 😂😂😂😂😂🔥
Marshawn is so fine
i need a ice bath my damn self
Real Ice City. Town Bidnezz. Marshwan Lynch the King of Oakland.
Socks on in the tub ? Yeaaa He’s a menace
The real henny lord
Kevin said it’s not that safe for me!!! 😂
Great to see Kevin back to 100%
Salute to "Beast Mode"! What a great talent! Should have been a back to back champion! Lol I'm still mad at you Pete.....lol
JUST ONCE I WANT A GAME TO BE COMMENTATED BY LYNCH AND TALIB. PLEEEEASE FOX/CBS/NBC
I DID NOT WANT THIS EPISODE TO END AT ALL!!! Damn it 😂
Best interview ever.
That was the scariest spit take ever
This is by Far the dopest interview every King Beastmode.
Lynch should broadcast games
This the funniest episode ya'll ever did! LMAO
White hand burr
Can we get see thru tubs? So we can see Kevin Hart sitting like one of them french girls??
Watching that man spit out the C4 is easily the funniest thing i've seen in 2022
Marshawn undefeated on Flip Cup fosho
Marshawn should make a youth & prep sports podcast called "1 Yard Line"
Thanks for asking the million dollar question
dude is hi a f
12:01 LMAOOOOOOOO
M Lynch is that dude!
I hope Marshawn comes out of retirement and play for the Seahawks for one more year 🙏
that pass play will forever be a wtf moment in NFL history
Bank bond is 1000 little man
He's in that ice like it's not NOTHING!!!! I couldn't be in there with one toe... He's a Beast...
I’m obsessed w/ Kevin’s necklace. He wore it on another talk show on YouTube and it was love at first sight like a person ha
Where th is daryle and bam bam
Nfls biggest loss is not recognizing there athletes personalities marshawn could’ve made the nfl so much money outside of football it isn’t even funny
mans put the hat on top of the towel 😂
When beast mode spit the c4 out I was dead. Dead meaning I was laughing out loud
Had no idea  Kevin was tatted lol
“Billy, what do you do for work?” “Well, I’m white hand” ✋
A grown man speaking like a ratchet teenager 🤦🏽‍♂️
“I did flip it” 🤣🤣🤣
Growing up in the bay, this video believe it or not is somehow the first real clip of me seeing someone completely clueless as to something I completely understand 🤣🤣 I’m sitting here asking myself is Kevin joking that he doesn’t know some of this sh*t or what…
“So you from Oakland, Iceland to be exact 🇮🇸”  “Naw n*gga Ice CITY”   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Interviews gotta be longer. Lol ppl like Marshawn, JRsmith, Draymond, etc. Gotta do special extended versions so we can get some real stories. Still funny💯
This ain’t that safe for me, and I don’t wanna drown over here 😂
Marshawn is one of the most giving ex athletes. His charity FAM 1st gives so much to intercity kids. He is so respected in my home Town of Oakland California. Also the man is helping the poor in Hawaii as most people think Hawaii is Paradise but for the locals it’s poverty. Watch on YouTube Marshawn giving out turkeys on the streets on Hawaii . This man is a sold brother!
Just learned the ice is fake!
BEST ONE IVE SEEN. IM CRYING OVER HERE LMMFAO
The bay area up in the building.
I love how this guy Kevin Hart’s the ghetto slang translator 😂 lol
Bam Bam!
Man I’m from Australia and I know what a band is…. I have to stop watching American tv
Me & marshawn are bday twins
Beast mode needs his own show
I love Marshawn 💯💯👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Marshawn is one of my favorite athletes of all time. He just a good dude!
super bowl XLVIII not XLVII!!!!!!!
Kevin out here explaining the lingo so it can be gentrified.
Kevin: what you rush for that year Marshawn: prolly a bando  I’m weak asl 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only people from bay area can understand marshawn 😭 👌🏾
first time that I’ve ever gotten scared
I don’t even watch this show. But I’m sooooo glad it popped up in my suggestions. I love Marshawn Lynch!! He’s pure comedy and don’t even have to try!! Wish this was longer!!
👍
Lmaooo
Are those OSU jersey’s hanging up behind them?
Idk why kevin trying to explain what Marshawn saying, west coast code pretty well known
Yo KH, you get tired of standing in the tub for so long?!😂😂😂
This was Great !! 😂❤👏🏾👏🏾 Loveeee Marshwan Lynch
Hilarious man a great time especially considering what's going on this week
First time kevin hart went that low
kev translating Marshawn ebonics around the 10:00 mark is hysterical 🤣 😆 😂 😄 😭 😀 🤣
Kevin might be the best comedian of all time
They need a show together.  Best episode
🤣🤣🤣
He is 🗑
Best episode
Comedy asf
Marshawn doing flip cup 😂 I can't.
Yadda
LaVar Ball and Marshawn Lynch are by far the best episodes 👍
Old spice gives you lice
He should be a two time champion but prescription Pete making terrible calls during the clinch. I hope your Happy in Denver my boy best of luck this year!! Stay strong.
WTF is a BANDO 🤷‍♂️😂
I stopped everything to watch Marshawn
Were most the black folk off today though…  We know it be about 5 of us usually on set Kevin! 🤣🤦🏾‍♀️
Yo for real I got scared when he stood up quick like that too.  Omg the C4 moment was hilarious. The red cup was even better LOL
0:58 Didn't the Ravens win Super bowl 47?
5:54 Lmao. I always wondered how the stool didn't float
Best episode hands down 💪🏽
The one detail about that day that was missing all along...Lenny Kravitz haha
AI big brother
I’m a white asf friggin Canadian and I can follow every word the homie says. However I did grow up listening to E-40
Make it uncensored
I lovvvvveee me some marshawn
This is by far the funniest one yet😂 everything was too funny
Hahaha Cali Oakland lingo hahaha
I love the explanation of Bay Area black language.
😂😂 I knew this would be funny!! The Marshawn breakdown was hilarious
I'ma slideee
It’s ice city, not Iceland lol
Yessir, Oakland represent
Kevin is genuinely funny 🤣
I’m crying this was so funny 😫😭😂
Seattle was a team to beat for the next 5 years but peetkbitch didn't want OG to win
There is so many great moment in here. Marsh saying he gotta get one of these after the white hand hands him a drink. 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
They didn't want him to win mvp simple as that and that's why I never watch football again it's second down not third why the f you pass instead of running it dumbest Seattle.
"a lil bip came out my whip" im crying
We got 1indian. Clap 1 time. 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Kevin standing straight up in that bihhhh lmao
Not even a minute in Marshawn puts a towel to cover his balls and hops in the tub with his socks on. This man is a legend.
When he spit his drink out I lost it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When he sunk to the bottom 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao!!! He sand a bando? Oh 1k how tf am I supposed to know wtf you talkin about haha
Someone get zlatan ibrahimovic on this show that’d be hilarious
Ima think about the weight under the stool, every time I watch now 😂
Marrrrrrshawn, 💪💪💙
They should have a strongman in the show 😂
"Crack his bip in da whip and take a sip"😂
For some reason I feel like the water is not even cold and the ice cubes are props. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Letting him have the bay slang
11:40 min mark got me crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OAKLAND CA STAND UP ❤️
Hi  Please some one here hellp me whith schoolarship. 😭🙏 i am  mozambican. Sorry for thath, but i am trying all maneres, sorry for my english
lol
Bro Marshawn lynch is the most entertaining person on earth
Beast Mode is one of my favorite former or current athletes.
Love it word up!
Aw ok that’s why it was a Hennessy shortage last year! 😂🤣😂
Imagine Marshawn & A.I. together spitting game! They so damn simular bruh i swear
White hand roll a blunt!
I love that man
Funniest episode
Honestly, bout 15 😂
bro got in with socks on
Never knew kev was tatted up😮
1:25 that s*** kind of bothers me because if there was a black hand in a white guy said come out black hand. Things would be a lot different the s*** shouldn't be allowed well if it is it should be allowed both ways. The roles are turning in this country especially in social media. Black people want to keep saying oh the country's ran by white people no social media is ran by transgendered biracial people who want to see white people destroyed for some reason when we're all human regardless.
I freaking love Marshawn!!!!
Kev da truth
We got one Indian too😭😭😭😭😭
Word up
The best game of flip cup I've ever seen 😂
When I say real Oakland ! That’s real Oakland ! Nothing but bay slang love it marshawn !
Affirmative action 😂
Hope everyone enjoys the weekend 😎
Believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, and you will be saved..Be baptized and repent of your sins. Repent simply means to turn away from your sins. God loves you and so do I. Amen
💚💙
Kevin: What tf is a bando? Mashawn: Oh 1000 Kevin: Why did you expect me to know what that was?  😂😂😂😂had me on the floor
Lynch just built like that guy y’all want to watch on yo tv screen. He is indeed that certified guy. 100% that guy pal
Best one so far 😂😂😭😭😭
lmao Marshawn is great on the mic, loved him on the peytoncast, great here.....he needs his own show!
Been waiting on this one ! Real asf
Mad funny
That was hilarious and entertaining...
KEVIN HART IS ALWAYS A GREAT HOST!
"I did flip it" 😂😂
Marshawn had such an interesting and cool personality. Dude is naturally funny lmao
Yall do know it's plastic and not real ice
How is it Kev's show and he can't get past the waist?
I loved watching Marshawn play. But I quit watching TV a year ago. I just check out YT from time to time anymore. He still playing?
Wrong super bowl, XLVIII champion
A whole Thow wow 😂
Hated marshawn lynch in the nfl, cuz that beast was too damn good, always a problem when my team faced seahawks xD, yeah im a niner fan, but outside the nfl, my boy keeps it 100!! For real, this interview was hilarious xD

I’m just here so I don’t get fined.
I’m watching this for the 3rd time , this was hilarious
“White hand don’t you ever respond to another man!!” 😂😂
This man went in straight socked up lmfao
I heard it was room temp water and fake ice.....
The ash from Marshawn's knees drained my phones battery!!
Hands down funniest episode 😂😂
I never thought you can drown in a tub . . . BUT TODAY KEVIN JUST PROVED ME WRONG 🫣😂😭🌊😳
🤣🤣
I'm from San Francisco but he is my favorite NFL player it's a BAY THANG
You know, for a guy who said he doesn't like attention or talking to the media, Marshawn Lynch sure does appear in a lot of these interviews with celebrity hosts and shows. He's appeared on late night shows as well.     Just saying............ I know he's a good player but Maybe it was a trick to get famous or attention.
Best episode hahahaha
Never laughed so hard watchin this
When beast mode shows up for an interview you know it's going to be a good one 🔥
😂😂😂
This jawn was funny! 🤣 had me dying
This has got to be the best interview of all time
We all know why he didn't get that ball on the 1!
Yo this is the realest and best episode ever.
"nah nah c'mon blood" 🤣🤣🤣he thought lil kev was about to drown
This is golden! LOL! I HATE THAT for Marshawn, he should have got the ball and the MVP.
Greatest episode yet
Love, love, love!❤
12:03 man almost died 🤣🤣🤣

Hey brad
Repent to Jesus Christ  ““Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God ; believe also in me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:1‬ ‭NIV‬‬ h
I was about to be mad if i didnt see daryl and bam bam!!!

Marshawn So cool
🗣 ICE 🧊 CITY 🏙
That boy Kevin really sorry
I think Marshawn could rock just about anything anyway and make it look dope 😭
Bay Area talk is the best
I want to see Marshawn and Tyson sit down and have a conversation...
Who else bought some old spice thanks to Kevin 🤣😂
Kevin heart need to make a new movie 🤣🤣☠️funny asl in Marshawn
Marshawn Lynch is a national treasure
😂
“Hey Brad” 😂😂😂😂
Anything with Marshawn is comedy 😂
First time on cold as balls I’ve ever gotten scared
Even considering the last name, Kevin's necklace looks feminine asf.
Kevin’s laugh made it funnier😂😂
best episode hands down
Lmao Kevin has tattoos 😂
BEASTMODE 💝🧡❤🧡💛💚💙🤎🖤🤍💦 ... Love you  Kevin for getting my GUY!!!
Ion think that's real ice in that tub
Most genuine dude in life bruh, on God 🤣🤣
This top 5😂💯
Heat in the head thing is actually right, that's what needs to be working right now.
I was lookin for this yesterday. Kinda mad I'm late now
Hey Brad🤣🤣 Hilarious that whitehand only responds to KH🤣
I wasn’t even there and I got scared when marshawn jumped up screaming 😂
Haha. Classic. We need to see Kevin, The Rock and Beastmode together bouncing off each other.  Would settle for more Kev and Beast tho.
Oakland, California
Hey Braddd
Hilarious!!!!!
Marshawn is a genuine dude and I honestly think he doesn’t do interviews because he’s shy and overall humble.
I wish we could’ve gotten a longer episode for this one
Marshawn is the best lol
"I did flip it" - Marshawn Lynch
His mother is such a smart women!!!!
missed these
Omw to see if there been a Hot Ones cross over ep yet
Stamped one of the funniest be yourself episodes 😂
11:30 - 12:15 is the Funniest!😂😂😂❣️
Marshawn let's go! Lol
Bruh that towel trick is mad smart
Marshawn did flip them tho lol
I stopped watching football after that 1 yard line pass…that was some bs
"Im only here so I don't get fined" - Isaac Newton or somebody like that
He’s just there so he doesn’t get fined🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hes from iceland ICE CITY hahaha
This need to be uncensored
I’m pretty sure KH be standing in that tub
Marshawn has always been a beast. Much respect
Beast mode a goat on and off the field
One of the best episodes easy!
This is why I LOVE MY CITY, OAKLAND CALI
That C4 was nasty as hell, he played that off smooth as a “spit take”. 😅
😂😂..Come on “BestCoast”..👏🏽👏🏽..good episode..😂😂..Bruh Bruh!!..✊🏾💯
We miss you.  GO BILLS
Kevin hella square blud! Real Town bidness, Deep East Durant st. 109th lol on the border baby
What’s goin on I’m Kevin 😂😂
No lie, when Marshawn got up real fast I didn’t know what was about to happen 😂
Let me guess without watching this will be too short pushing the white agenda 😂
LOL Network & Netflix need to make a Celebrity Cold as balls gameshow
7:40 what I came for
Showing the weight under the chair is amazing 😂
I been waiting for this my whole life 😂
Best one yet!
Marshawn Lynch and Kevin Hart is so funny together and he cracks me up at all times.
They didn't give it to him cause when he scores he guaranteed the MVP and the NFL didn't understand that he was a good guy and not the crazy niqqa on the squad. Marshawn was so good I would've handed him the ball on 3rd and 4th down.
🔥😂🔥😂🔥
Everything was cool but I hope he wasn’t drinking and driving …
Yall should mix hot ones with cold as balls.
Thats not Marshawn....thats Detective Bagabitch.
Gotta fuc wit Marshawn
Kev went habbi
This is the GOAT episode!!!
lets go Beast mode!!!
That Kevin Hart slang interpretation was spot on ! 😂😂🔥
Can we get an Uncensored version?
I'm a little disappointed you didn't talk about the Beast Quakes, Kev
Marshawn curses like a sailor and I'm here for it!!🤣🤣🤣 the Bleeps have me DYING!!
Kev you from Philly and don't know what ah bando means lmao  💀🤦🏾‍♂️
I stopped watching these but I had to click for this one..BEAST MODE👍🏾
It's how marshawn grabbed a dry towel and Kev 2 face towels lol
🤣🤣🤣
The Big Homie.  One of my favorite football players ever based off of his personality alone... Respect
Tf was bam and Darrell???
White hand? Imagine if the host was white calling analogous figure “black hand” double standards! Shits racist
Kevin Hart is irrelevant these days. Go back 3 years to when we cared
🤣😂🤣😂
Bay Area baby 😂😂😭 new all of marshawns lingo this man’s a legend 💪🏽
MFer sounding like the Cookie Monster 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love and miss the Beast! Seattle has never been the same since you left. Your short return during the playoffs was cool, but definitely not the same. I love hearing Marshawn's life stories, real wisdom if you listen.
Check out Blank Kanvas podcast
Kevin should get a smaller tub. It makes sense and its funny
A genuine spit take lol
This episode was so good I had to watch it twice, definitely miss seeing that man Marshawn on the field one of my favorite Running Backs of all time.. 💪🏽
What do they benefit by sinking themselves into this cold liquid?
the interpretation of the conversation😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else didn't understand anything of what he said, but it was still captivating af
Lmaoooo that’s what my grandma would tell us… growing up in Denver/Colorado, she would say to wear a beanie to bed cause it will keep you warm
Black hand literally dropped only 3 ice cubes into lynch tub at the end, I counted ! Fear set in when he saw em stand up😂😂😂
I’m tryna figure out why I don’t get notifications anymore and I have the whole nine on
Kevin’s face when Marshawn stood up is truly comedy😂
Yassss Marshawn
Where can you get one of those tubs?
We are in the last days. "All who call on the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST shall be saved"
Love when Kevin plays Google Translater so folks at home can understand Marshawns slang lol
Kevin getting braver for the cold😂
Marshawn is literally my favorite person on earth for like the past decade
Hi Brad!
I love Marshawn Lynch
Lmao! I needed this midday laugh! Lol, peace to everyone reading this message. Hope you all are having a great day. Remember the name: Savvy Magnetism!
Kevins flex after the C4 ad was like a little kid who picked up a big rock and threw it in the water and then flexed to his mom lmaoooo
The Big Dawg in the House!
Fave episode and it honestly isn’t even close🤣🤣🤣
Town Business mane! NSO WSO ESO!!
Best one yet
I never met Marshawn a day of my life and understood off rip what he meant when he said he ran for a band. Kevin Hart is fried for making him elaborate on what he said 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dang this should have been longer
This prolly the funniest episode 😂
Kevin don't know what sleep mean smh lol
Rumor has it that he’s only there so he wont be fined.
God I love this man!!!
Can I do this in my bathtub or is having a metal tub necessary?
To whoever is reading this : May God bless you ! You’re gunna do great in life  ! Put God first and everything will fall into place ! John 3:16 says , “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life ! Wishing nothing but love , joy , peace, prosperity, faith, hope, etc. Have a blessed day ! God loves you so much!!!!!
Marshawn went beast mode in the end 🤣
I met Marshawn in Seattle at a restaurant. Was just sitting at the bar and he plopped next to me. I nodded. He nodded. Had good drinks and a decent chat. Guy was super nice and humble. So many people kept coming up to ask for autographs and pictures and stuff. He turned down probably like 12 people over the course of our few drinks. I can't imagine how annoying it must be.
So funny so good man i needed this big laugh! Thanks Kevin & Marshawn!!
We need a Bio movie on Beast Mode, he's hilarious 😂😂😂
A Bando in Detroit is a abandon house lol
I don’t think he understood the question Kev asked about his reaction to the 1 yard play 🤣🤣🤣
Marshawn needs to be a NFL commentator. He's so damn funny.
Sound like the cookie monster lmaoooo
A BANDO & SUM CHANGE!! 😭😭😭
Kevin actually went into the tub instead of dipping his balls everytime 😂
“Like a bando”
Why does Marshawn not have his own TV show

Is Marshawn funnier than Kevin???
😂😂😂😂

Hello, Love to you all. Repent and believe the gospel, that our Lord and savior Jesus Christ was God, who came to us as a human being over 2000 years ago, that he lived the perfect life we can’t, died on the cross and shed his blood for all of our sins, and was resurrected 3 days later, by the power of God. Simply believe this, and be forgiven and saved from Gods judgement.  By grace through faith in our Lord, you are saved, and there is nothing you can do to earn his favor. God wants to give you the free gift of eternal life to all those who'd believe in his sons sacrifice for salvation! He will then give you his Holy Spirit to help walk and guide you in all his ways, get baptized as well afterwards. Please read the new testament to get more info about Jesus Christ.  The Lord Jesus Christ bless you all

3:37 Shaking out the hat to put on top the towel😂
Marshawn is a champion flip cup player LOL
The C4 flex and Marshawn spitting it out was the best part of an interview I’ve ever seen 😂
Get terry crew and for your last episode get the rock it’s only right
This episode could’ve easily been 2 hours long and I wouldn’t even mind

People outside of Cali won’t get this vid 🤣 but if u from Cali it’s fucking funnyyyy
You live in LA and don't know what a bando is been out since the 60s

Stay blessed, strong and focused  I don't have so many subscribes but the few i have are so special to my struggle ♥️♥️
Beast mode flipping the cups the way he did is the equivalent of someone falling forward instead of back during a trust fall… and it’s hilarious 😂🤣
This is by far the funniest one, had my rollin 😂😂😂😂
Lol the flex after the c4 chug is hilarious 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
I died when marshawn spit out the drink
Kev better put some respek on Ice City name 🤣
I had no idea what Lynch said but I knew exactly what he was saying at the same time
Blazè, blazè
🤣🤣🤣🤣
12:01 best moment
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life135

Lol I repeated 11:46 7x lol
Marshawn hops in the tub with socks on. Then there's an Indian guy named Brad. I'm laughing already.

Haven’t laughed so hard in a while the C4 part lol
Best one yet much love Beastmode

Indian I'm dead
Yall know this ice is fake
This episode was hilarious
By far the funniest Episode of Cold 🥶 As Balls!! On Gawd!! I never laughed so hard I choked on saliva.
Kevin you gotta let the man finish his story…
LOL WHY DID DARRYL RUN AFTER PUTTING MORE ICE IN MARSHAWN'S TUB? HE WAS LIKE "I DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH FOR THIS, MARSHAWN, I DIDN'T MEAN TO, KEV MADE ME DO IT"!! LOL 😂😂😅😅🤣🤣
He said he laughed at Pete Carroll going to the sideline.after that 1 yard line play.,lol🤣🤣🤣Thats the perfect response to one of the worst play calls in history. Laugh in the coaches face. Only Beast Mode
This is my favorite episode of them all beside the one with T.O my Favorite

When they took out the c4 lmaoooo

Kevin representing like he went to some community college with that send off game or BYU with that drinking.
Big Seahawks fan here. Absolutely love beast mode, but as someone who is not a native English speaker, I don’t understand a work he said.
This one had me crying 😭😭. Kevin explaining the slang did it for me

Kevin’s out here looking like an Indonesian air stewardess
It’s messed up he only had him on here for the Super Bowl question
Beast modeeeee
At 8:27. “Cuz you fucked up Cuz” to the coach. 😂😂😂😂
I got scared that if Kevin said something other then Ice City one more time Lynch was going to cuss him out.
💙🙏
Let’s go !!
The coolest football player ever.
lol great sports talk guys, & BeastQuake!!! Get off me Tracy Porter!!!
Beastmode is 100% authentic
I'm a colts fan. But Marshawn Lynch is a beast!
Marshawn needs to be protected at all cost 😂😂
Khabib next?
" A lil bip came out my whip" is crazy 🤣
😂😂😂
I cannot believe ... Kevin Hart... WOULD ASK... about Marshawn on the 1 yard line vs the Patriots at the Superbowl. I hate that moment... I stop watching interviews and highlight reels when that moment is mentioned... one day I will let it go. That day is not today.
He's just here so he won't get fined
Nah so this whole time Kevin just be floating holding himself up 🤣
Just realized this is the Hot Ones tactic. Sean changed the game!
Darrell and bam Bam didn't play around on this episode lol
Seattles very own
Jesus loves y’all ❤️
Jesus loves y’all ❤️
Now I want some skittles!
Damn lil Kevin done got tatted up! 😂
Loved every bit of this interview him and the undertaker was my favorite 😂😂
Town Bussines in the building 💯💯
Hey Brad.
15*12=108 Henny bottles
Town Bizzness he's one of a kind!
This my favorite one. Hands down😂
Marshawn has to be the most universally loved football player in the last like 50 years. Nobody dislikes this dude
Did this man hop in the cold tub with black socks on? Savage
These are fake ice cubes in the water.
Ahhh  this was comedy much respect. The town in the Oakland Ca.
Lmao 🤣🤣
Yo KEV almost drowned
I re watched Kev making Marshawn laugh like 10xs
Out of all of the Cold is Balls that I’ve watched, someone asking Kevin how he’s still the same height in the tub  for sure makes this the best one 😂😂😂😂😂
So the truth is Kevin will sink to the bottom is the real reason he doesn't get all the way in. 😂😂😂😂😂
THOUWOW BANDO 😂
The translation had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
Biscuits and gravy....
"You keep the heat in the head, it's tactics to this muhfu**a, just put a towel round that bi*ch"- Wise words from Marshawn Lynch
😂 throw sum warning shots or something. He asked Kevin for a joke warning or sumtin 😂
Huge fan. Trying to promote positivity and blissful vibes with my clothing line tropic 🏝trying to change the world through clothing. Trying to change how people look at clothing 🏝

"Ask and you shall resceive" ✝️
This is the 1st time I’ve seen Kevin sit all the way in the cold tub.
I kan't be the only one who saw bro put his feet in with socks on
This interview could n should’ve been longer
First 45 seconds and Beast Mode has me laughing. “Gotta take care of your s**t” 🤣
I never seen this mf so open and smiling so much ahah i love it… I think he gonna figure out how to get a “white hand” 😂😂
This is gold bruh. The best one of all time 😂😂
Naw the clapping 😭💀
THAT WAS FREAKING HILARIOUS 😳
Best one yet😂💯
The Biip Episode
Kev a damn cheater!!!
Marshawn was open af on that play too. Couldve thrown it his way. Is what it is tho, history 🤷‍♂️
Marshawn a serial killer  Its a official  THIS MAN IN THE TUB WIT SOCKS😱😱😱
I appreciate Kevin translating for nerdy white dudes like me.
The flip cup at the end got me
Mar Shawn is goated
10:39 so the Undertaker episode doesn’t exist
Hey brad 😂😂😂
There better be skittles in that tub... beast mode!!!
KNEW THIS EPISODE WAS LEGENDARY BEFORE I CLICKED IT 😂
Where is Bam Bam & Daryl
Marshawn😍😍😍😍😍
"Hey Brad" lol
That’s the first time he’s ever got all the way in 🤣
MarShawn left after he knew it’s rigged cuz they knew he wouldn’t fumble
Biscuits and gravy.
Kev finally went all the way in the tub haha ayee
I knew what a bando was lmao
When he told them to clap that had me dying 😭😭😭
I’ve never had to rewind two different moments of this show to laugh more EVER‼️‼️
My Philadelphia Eagles could use BEAST MODE this year if he ever wanted to come outta retirement...he's enjoying life without football
Mad respect to Marshawn still not throwing anybody under the bus for Superbowl 49 loss. Sure he was upset about it but always just put it in the rear view.
He was talking exactly how Kevin said thugs talk on one of his stand ups I think it was "seriously funny" or "I'm a grown little man" one of them😂😂😂😂
This is an awesome interview!!!!!!!
The only reason why he’s hosting Cold As Ball is so that “HE DON’T GET FINE”
Top 3 episodes ever‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️😂😂😂😂😂
I would ask for more but the ice-bath is a perfect way to justify why it's not, either way this was funny as hell and I enjoyed it.
"And I'm a Family Man"😂😂- Marshawn Lynch💕
Dam cash nasty made it far with the “time to pay some bills”  He bout to get paid!!
Looking like a swole pop Warner football player
he did not just say "that white hand coming in f*****g handy"😂😂😂😂😂🤭
Marshawn playing video games with Conan O Brien was funniest imo. But this was alright 👍
“This ain’t that safe for me “ lol
I'm pissed that bam and Darrell didn't do anything in that episode like wtf
This episode got me laughing so hard 🤣🤣
More of lynch lol pt 2-3-4-5
That’s my dawg beast mode
😆😆😆 Kevin Hart salute
Beast Mode  a Beast lol
Marshawn is the best
Finally!!! Let’s go!!
Best Random Click Ever 😂😭💀
Mann Kevin comedy
He called white hand “cousin”😂😂😂😂😂
This the first game Kevin Hart lost 😂😂. I’m glad to see less segments with Bam Bam and the other guy, they started to feel way too forced and I’d rather see more camera time of the person they’re interviewing
Lol I thought I was the only one to call it a thow wow and I’m in GA😅 lmaooo
Kevin the goat but I’m here for Bam bam and Darrell🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
Man those fake ice cubes
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin.Give your life to Jesus before it’s to late. Jesus he is the way,the truth  the light, .If you want to know how reply with how!!
Kev might as well have ended the interview after Beastmode spit. I didn't hear a word of the interview after that 😂.  Something tells me that C4 will be discontinuing it's sponsorship with Cold As Balls!
Fire starter
When you stood up some bip came out my whip- Kevin 😂
God bless❤️
Sorry kevin but c4 is not good
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE
Lenny Kravits still has nightmares about Lynch running up on him. Lol
Does Kevin have any balls left after icing them so many times now
By far the best interview
I'm from Stockton Cali homie, I understood everything Marshawn was saying already before Kevin's translation. 😂😂😂
Marshawn almost got took out lmaoooo
The fact Kev might drown if he actually sit down is crazy 😂
ICE CITY The breakdown of Marshawn vernacular lol
Missed the perfect opportunity to ask about the “I’m just here so I don’t get fined”
😂😂😂😂
They didn't give the ball to Marshawn bc they knew if he would of won the game 🤦he would of been interviewed the most and you know what he was going to say at the interviews😂I'm just here so I wont get fined 😂🤔and they didn't want that type of controversy for the Seahawks 💯
Idk why people say Marshawn Lynch is funny. I never laughed once.
kevin not knowing what a bando was shows the difference lmaoooo
Bruh I died when Kevin sunk in the tub 😂it's a literal arm and core workout the whole video
Hey got in with his socks on he fucks with em on fs
He was just there so he wouldn’t get fined 😭
A bando is also a abandon house you use for street pharmacy purposes lol
😂😂😂😂😂
best episode yet... wish you did more with Marshawn!
Funniest sh** had me dyyyying 🤣🤣🤣
this aint that safe for me lol
Shleep means he was flabbergasted/mad
Scooby Doo & Scrappy 2022
😂🔥🔥😂🔥
His face when marshawn stands up 😲🤣🤣🤣😂😂💀💀
😂😂
This is the most white hand is in the show!!!
Why he spit the c4 out like that 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We all know Kevin was going to cheat his way into a win at flip cup then he realized he fucked up once he took that first shot of Henny 😂😂
This might be the funniest episode yet. 😂😂😂
I don't know who was the #1 interview, but Beast mode coming through to take the spot.
We not gonna talk about how Kevin was neck deep in the tub 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Best episode 🖤😂
This the one . These 2 together is dangerous to society 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣

This was good
Lynch found Bam too weird. Asked them to stay inside
This episode was gold hahahah
Heey Brad.... lmaoooo
This might be the best damn episode 🤣🤣🤣 Marshawn is real legend
This one needed to be longer 🤣
Lol that  Lenny Kravitz story was too funny.
"White Hand! Hand him a towel!" ...even though there is a towel next to him within arms reach. y'all hell man 🤣
Marshawn is so naturally funny. He was so good on Murderville.
Why these episodes so short
The weight tho
11:50 Sound like the Cookie monster over here slamming that thang had me dead af with that slurp in it Gaaaah daaamn 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
kevin flexing lol
☠️ Iceland, icetown.
first time Kevin went in the water completely
Marshawn so ashy 😂😂😂😂 that's my dawg
A Bando and some change 😂
They didnt want Marshawn to be the MVP of the game that simple... thats why they passed it. or... It could be rigged.. to have russ throw that interception and give patriots the championship. you never know. You see Bill Belichick sat that same DB in there next superbowl appearance and they lost.. With no explanation as to why he would sit him in there biggest game.. maybe he wasnt suppode to get the pick against Seattle either way... something strange happened...
Oh!! no, they didn't. These 2 together, it's about to be epic.
Top 3 best cold ones 🐐🐐🐐🔥
That's why Tom Brady is really  not the GOAT seahawks was suppose  to win that game. Nope sorry Lord said I was over it sorry no grudge. Just happy to see he made it do what it do after the football an he can still go out there and ball
White hand got some action today😂😂
You seen Daryl face!! He was scared to pour that ice 😂😂
That 11:30-12:30 mark is so damn funny 😂😂😂😂
Lynch comedy heart cracks up 💯
Anytime I See Marshawn Lynch I Gotta Watch
We love ❤️ Marshawn
