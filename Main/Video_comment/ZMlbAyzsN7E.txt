How come I never seen a RPG that have enemies change behavior depending on their level and yours? Imagine you and a enemy bandit are level 30, since you are even level, he will attack you. Now lets say you are level 15 and the bandit is level 45, he will not attack you unless you provoke him due to him thinking you are a waist of time. Now lets say you are level 45 and the bandit is level 15, he will instead try to avoid you as he knows you can kick his ass. Honestly if there is a Skyrim mod that does this, I need it because I get annoyed when I have to dismount my horse covered in enchanted daedric armor only to fight 3 retarded wolves.

I’d get pretty close though, got it down like 2/3 on my 17th try

When this happens I just happen to cheese the game somehow like in this one game I glitched into a tree and killed the boss that was like 20 levels above me with arrows only going down to run around and collect my arrows.
If you bring in enough healing items, you can tank all the hits and heal afterwards. Get far away and shoot him with a ranged weapon. Make sure you enter the fight with as much ammo as possible. If you have any weapons that can use fire, like explosives or a Magic wand, that should work well against him, conidering he is mostly non fireproof clothing and flesh. If you manage to get high up enough, u can jump onto his head and stab him in the eyes with an Arrow, Spear, Sword/Knife/Dagger, Sharp stick, Katana, Lethal injection. This is going by damage levels. Tbh, i think u get syringes later in the game so thats a bust.
I'm like that 🤣😀
Like fighting big enchantress in shovel knight whilst getting the speedrun achievement. U have nothing to help you and ur fighting the final boss. B R U H .

I mean...Its possible. In the witcher, wild hunt..I was thinking "a question mark must mean its a secret or something good" when i did not know its way above my lv. I died some times to it, but killed the tree that threw vines at me and stuff. Not that sure, but my problem is if something kills me i HAVE to kill it before i can move on. xD
That's why I grind and stay away from enemies with a higher level than me
Can someone suggest a game like this? I'm having a hard time finding one

Darksouls on another level
Me first time playing DS 3
Me: eh fuck it I’ll smoke him  Me after I get bashed: I’ll level up another 5 times *sigh*
This is where you use all your potions mushrooms books respawns everything and it would not be worth it
After getting killed by the boss the player learns from his mistakes

Greg Renko
I like the Skyrim quest sound
he forgot to use the storm ruler
Yeah I would rather make a level 50
But what if he came across eredin the king of the wildhunt
Nice lax stick
Don't forget to subscribe if you enjoyed the video!!😁😁
You play lacrosse?
Don’t worry! That level 5 quest was probably another one of those annoying fetch quests.
I personally think this is naruto in a nutshell 😂
Im the guy who does this and actually manages to defeat the boss first try by some miracle. I swear I'm so underpowered for almost all the bosses i fight and still win. Pro gamer moment
Well that was quick
In any game where there is higher leveled fights I will save and die 20+ times just to beat it and get nothing yet I still feel so satisfied
I fought a boss with a single hit,gives me alot of damage when I have to use my strongest skill to BARELY DO ANYTHING,I did defeat it,on one live left-
Yay he is using a lacrosse stick as a weapon those things are deadly
dork souls 69
blue
I like how he sighs to confirm he's not the first lvl 15 hero to show up
boss:breathes player:dies
A few thousand dodges And stacking the bleed effect will be fine
There are 2 types of games  Game type 1: you can easily cheese bosses higher level than you ( such as assassins creed ) Game type 2: bosses 1 level above yours are basically gods
So dark souls
Him fought the laginator😳
Him having a lacrosse stick as a weapon left me laughing
Lol
Me:has end game gear "a strong boss" me:ya I can kill him "Strong boss destroys me" Me:I need to farm more
Me reaching lvl 45 in genshin impact
"Well that was quick" that's what she said
he nailed the rock eyebrow raise what a chad what an alpha male
Quest giver: well that was quick  Me: lel
Hi
That sigh brought him to 1HP.
This is why I do all the side quests first
when laginator beats toxic player
Plot twist:he was about to give little timmy his lvl max sword
What getting into a Valkyrie fight in early god of war feels like.
I never played dark souls but is this like dark souls?
I still have the dislike button
Ah yes. Attacking a Giant with a Broom. And getting KILLED with a broom
Me a level 300 fights a level 425 boss Me:kills it with no issue The level 1000 guy who assisted me without me knowing:why does he keep fighting higher level bosses
I was once playing this game jn which in every city the monster levels were raised by 20 like in city a the level was 20 than city B the level was 40 and it took ages to level your self up
Only taijutsu works on him. *5 gates open**
he didn't even parry smh
How gods think kratos is
I used a lacross stick as a sword to ☠️
In honkai imapact you could challenge the higher boss thats completely out of your level to beat but i always do that since you have infinite dash/invade and its kinda fun  gaining infinite combos and rewards are good too (if you manage to survive).
Fallout 76 Quests:
Game name
U play lacrosse?
I can see you have finally gotten threw the first enemy in dark souls 3 now your at yhorm the giant good job
Me on the other hand: Um... Why does the boss say 263 but I say 999999_?! Am I bugged? Game maker: let's see wha- oh um... Your a main character and a boss fight! Me: WAIT WHAT?! them: good luck cuz your vs Thanos Me: AW HELL NAH!
Greg, if u see this, do u remember me?
Yeah first time that happened to me was during ffxv they said demons come out at night but they never said the demons were 50ft tall. (Beat them but damn…. Talk about death by a thousand cuts…)
Fake
That beard tho
Traveler from GI: AYO PAIMON, GET SPOONINIG
This man uses his lacrosse stick for everything
Ah, a fellow lacrosse player
Well that was quick
This man is play dark souls 🤣🤣
Raid quests, dang it.
I agree
I think it's funny how speedrunners r so skilled that this isn't even a thing that causes problems for them
Just a regular day in every game
T0
Plot twist: it was a lvl 2 quest
The one boss that is slow and has no ranged attack that is level 50 "Level 15 silly bo..." *dies to running and spam*
Uh oh 666k views
Well that was quick
We need to get laginator gets banned
Love how he uses a lacrosse stick lol

Witcher 3 in a nutshell
Okay dude make a part two but this time make him aim for the toes no one can handle the toes
Too easy
Plot twist the boss was level 99
Dark Souls bosses explained in a very short period of time
What game is this?
Will you cut your hair PLS I BEG YOU

"The younger generation is so eager to get themselves killed...." 🤣🤣
how do you make your vids?
🤣🤣
Greg and Goliath
If i were the boss i would just remove him from the area lol
Does anyone else see he is using a lacrosse stick as a sword
This had soooo much loop potential
The “that was quick” got me
Destiny 2 be like
do you actually play lacrosse?
Can you show us how to make those guns
Do you play lacrosse?
Always go for the toes
Lol
That's what she said 🤣
bruh uh lvl 5 quest but i am 15 lvl me hu
Imagine being impatient
That why I bring strong firends who help with with boss and I get some point form killing it
Lol some how for all quest like this I find a way to cheese it
Then when you do good 2 hours into the boss fight and you are evading every attack you look at his health and it is only at 1/4 down
Video idea: when the Laginator runs into a Hacker
borderlands be like… on a first playthrough
Borderlands be like:
Did you play lacrosse
"Younger generations always so eager to get themselves killed"   Yup 😀
When he sighed I thought after the boss exhaled that you would be blown away
Nah a true sigma gamer would just rely on dodges and the attack pattern to expose weak spots and spend an hour whittling it's health away just to mess up once and have to restart
Ay I dnno why but him sayin 'hey you! Giant ugly thing' just made me wheeze
Skyrim???
What does he use for making his weapons
You play lacrosse
I fought and beat the snake handler guy when i was level 10 from AC: Odyssey. Took like 2 hours of constant dodging and sneak attacks though.
We need a different series but on the old man’s back story
That's what she said
Greg bro you know how you do the ads for mobile those are funny you should do ROK rise of kingdoms there dumb aswell
true bro once when i was playing zelda botw and i went to the castle with only two divine beasts defeated. i got my ass handed to me and then i went to do the other divine beasts
Try using nerf modulus, it might fit you
Boss: here we go again. Another weak level player. Gramps: welcome back! How was dying?
ooooohhhhhh! Greedy greedy greg!
Roll you hollow! Roll!
"Younger generations are always so eager to get themselves killed."  Such true words. 8 yr old kids on FN always rush into a fight. How do I know? Mostly the internet, but also thru experience.
Are you from Slovenia? Cause when you recorded the quiz video you take the same index as in slovenian seria milioner and name Greg is similary as Gregor and Gregor is slovenian name...
That's what she said
Level 15 boi: im coming to take you down  Boss: oh boy.. not another one
me fighting thunderblight Gabon on 4 hearts ;-;
in borderlands this is way too true we just go in lvl 20 against lvl 45 boss.
The laginator should try minecraft bedwars
A good exemple are the zeolots from assassin's creed valhalla
Yo skedadudler
*Looks at 0 death darksouls run  "Pathetic"
I feel like if the boss was level 100, he would either be higher than the length of  the sun, or he could just breathe on something and it'd be vaporized
The boss: "really? Another ant?"
Literally every dark souls player when they first play
When you do all the quest before the boss
Fighting alduin too early in a nutshell I got lucky to defeat him and then twice God dodging is God and life
Enemies in ghost recon breakpoint when they’re a level higher than you:
Calamity Ganon for noobs
Good job, you tickled his toe.
This is exactly like the witcher 3 wild hunt🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hhh
RuneScape be like:
If you're seeing this, the YouTube shorts algorithm has brought us together for a reason. Stay strong comrade.
it's 3 am yet I can't stop watching these
i would just pinch at it until it dies and trust me i have patients
I wish theres a game like dis
This one's better than the original! 😂
Cheese: ima end this mans whole career
I love it how when he's talking to himself he's just like "Hey! Giant Ugly Thing!"
Dark souls 3
He turned from like 4 to 15 ( and also i got my vaccine TODAY )
LAGiHACKER when???
Where is the laginator
Greg I love your videos so much. They are very funny and make my day! Hope you have a good Christmas :)
Me fighting a Gigantix Dustyl Hammer after accidently encountering it:
🤣🙏👼☮️ Blessings 🎄🙏📹😂
Dimucc- calling himself pretty Greg- calling himself ugly 😅
But I can still kill high level bosses
So true
Well that was quick
Go donate to team seas
If it's a giant you just need the storm ruler
me when i have to go against a giant in skyrim:
Lol that's literally me rushing to complete the game xD
Then that godmode level 1 player pulls up and beats the boss after two and a half grueling hours
Dark Souls in a nutshell
I beat a lv 30 boss as a 12 character mainly cus I just kept dodging   Took about 2 hours though
*Skyrim*
Dude just turn on difficulty scaling then you get higher level quests

After watching this 5 times I noticed his weapon is a lacrosse stick
“The younger generations always so eager to get themselves killed lemme tell ya”  Can you blame us?
Greg
Really that was the first enemy in the level 100 castle
My first playthrough on the first level of Sonic Unleashed in a nutshell
Hi
I'm here In the 5 hours
just give him the quest which says get yourself killed the quickest
Nice
A kick from the boss would have been more than enough or u toe smack
suggestion on new video "When The Boss is easy to cheese"
Some normal person fight yhorm 1974 colorized
Sometimes, I straight up do all side quests till I have to do the main one just to unlock more side quest......I do get very strong XD
The perfect loop doesn't exi-
My Age Is 15
Hey
This video screams Borderlands
We know higher level enemy can just one hit you but why we not just outsmart instead rushing
Hi
Skyrim level up sound 😂
yeah its so quick.i already kill it XD
this iskratos but he wins
Me trying to kill the asylum demon before realizing I was supposed to grab a weapon first
"The younger generation is always so eager to get themselves killed"😂😂😂😂😂😂
I also hate : lvl 50 quest, lvl 70 boss
As a former Shadow Fight 2 player, I can relate. A boss just 1 level higher can tank you literally cutting their head off. When you level up to match them, they are fairly difficult in a good way.
"The new generation are always so eager to get themselves killed" my facts meter is off the charts.
Ofcourse
Can you do “LAGinator gun attachments” please
every Adventure Quest games be like😂😂

BOSS: (HA THIS GUYS IS SO TINY! I BET HE IS SCARED!) Player: Hey you! Giant ugly thing! BOSS: NANI!!!
God bless you guys Always keep God first
The acting is good, he even got a hit mark around his neck right after his respawn.  Edit: Hoh, hoh~ ouh my god, 1.6K likes? Thank you everyone, I can't still believe it!
LOL
*Me whenever there is a very difficult boss I shouldn't be fighting yet:* It is never not time to dodge, if I parry even once I'm dead
When you are a noob and think you have the skill to kill a boss 2x your level but you don't
So true!!
Shhesh
