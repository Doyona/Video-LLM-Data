So it just me who kind of thought Connor looked like Bruno Fernandez at first
Cole palmer Cole palner
Chris is the new mrbeast just for this amazing vid mate❤❤
imagine he got hard during the nude drawings 😭
Me and Connor have the exact same penalty stance
00:42 A NAKED GUY/GIRL IN THE CORNER 💀💀
Chris should get it on his arm bc it’s his logo
Who won England or italy
Who is here after Spain beating England in the Euro 2024 final
England lose in the final on pens again
Ahhh English meet once again

Cool video Belabed Crhis
Theo is literally maguire 💀
“messages friends and theo”
I watched it again and found out that team one still had a chance
11:42 It was not well placed at all...
He’s on 5.99 mil subs !
..
I love your videos. They are very entertaining and help in bad times... ❤❤
to answer the question of the name, it would have gone better
Love u Chris but FORZA AZZURI 🇮🇹 🇮🇹 🇮🇹

DO A COLLAB WITH CHUFFSTERS
This is the like fifth time I've watched this! Absolute banger for me 🔥
Hi
'messaged friends and Theo' why am I laughing so much  🤣
why is almost everybody wearing an england shirt without a star??
Get 10 tattooed on your back and you are a football shirt
The one guy who clearly cares about his hair more than every other person in this video happens to get the hair forfeit….& of course doesn’t do it….shocking.
bro giving loosing nostalgia
all they needed was 5 harry maguires bro
18:28 u can see pubes
cant lie thought theo was in his forties
Same host everything of beta squads vid 19:48 😂😂😂😂😂
Beta squad was here 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 19:26

Please comment back
Hi Chris I am a big fan
The waffle house has found Its new host
Keeper took the real L tbh.
The cod music when theo stepped up got me😂
Honestly, it's going too far
Showing somebody having a stand up punishment kinda ruines the surprise
Bro and Sam wanted a nude model as prize? The heck
Kinda unfair to let the YouTubers get a chance at the 10k, they needed it the least
if england fans took the penalities id have mroe faith in us winning is the reality - when the goign gets tough they always bottle it sadly
Ohio Lev yashin💀💀 there is no second yashin I will tell u that Yashin is my idol and I am not being rude
hhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Gareth did not watch. 🥲
Love how this was filmed at the menace arena.... just saw the the worlds smallest stand in the corner!
pie is fat and clapped
I've genuinely seen worse stand up from actual comedians!
England so bad of a team that they gotta use what ifs 💀
Stupid bets are the only thing keeping the tatoo industry alive
What if they were taken by white English people?
The gk moves before the ball is kicked  Relies on sheer luck and nothing else  Should have had a better gk
Pay keeper 5€ per save thats the way to do it
what a wonderful start of the work, for the '48rupees',
Ill be honest I could take a 100 pens and not miss 95 of them
Nice video, as a Croatian I loved the "Croatian" goal net! 😄🇭🇷
This is gonna sound like bullshit but my dad and his team coded ultimate fan.
these were the better days...
I cAnT fEeL mY lEgS
Shoutout to the double failed fist bump/handshake at 12:44
I'm glad that guy didn't have to shave his eyebrows. They take forever to grow back.
Pie looks ridiculously english💀💀
bro who gets a tat on the bottom of ur foot lmaooo, that's hella wack wtf
id never miss a pen
18:30 is a little sus tho
okay im assuming the description was edited because bale did just score that pen
18:28, look at that product placement!
Anyone else think the sponsor said only fans
Last
who tf made the thumbnail
Yo I’m ten and I’m taller than you
I’d say the stand up forfeit would be the worst I’d hate doing that
18:27 i think there is something unblured but i csnt tell
Love me a bit of pie
L bozo England 🦾 italy
Alex was jokessss. Would love to see him do more stand up comedy. He’s great at storytelling and is super funny!
“Rubbish at penalties unless Ben Foster is in the sticks.” 😂
6:37 That's Nicolas Gage!
the keeper aint 9 ft tall
Oh my gosh finally a British YouTuber! 🙏🏼
GA
Theo is maguire
It would of probably been better for England
it got to 30 ads and I gave up lol ridiculous
I just realised this was released on my birthday
Lads where is this stadium?
Italy is still better than England, also if the Italian fans would play the would do 10-0
Last
i cried when pieface missed
Who here didn't know pieface was this tall🤣
mate we all know that if james milner took all of them they would be champions stop the cap
And won it on penalties      Euro 2020 winners: England
plymouth argle
Fair play to the guys who did the Forfits
Ligma balls
Must be coining it in if he can just dish out 20k willy nilly 🤣
What even is team 2
me just happy that theres a manchester united fan
if you love football this video is for you: https://youtu.be/Ft1S2uZJAJI
im soryy but.  this is too far ? even if they agreed? what is this bro
18:27 u can kinda see it lol
19:01
Pie is the goat
Is Theo always injured or what😂
I actually loved the stand up section. I don't suppose there's a full unedited version somewhere for everyone's entertainment??
can we just talk about how scripted this is?
Pie is so bad tho ngl
https://youtu.be/f-xuhSpqi7E
Vi el video de tu gato y crei que era cierto. Me entere de que no y ahora solo me apetece llorar.
I was for Italy🇮🇹🇮🇹
I would argue the nude is the best one
It is very hard,but I ur a professional it's different
Genuinely better than the England team
I don’t like pieface
Get a new keeper
They even have VAR😂😂😂
I actually love Jamie he's so funny he should be on more videos!
You spoiled the winners at the beginning
10:43 up the bootlegger.
Our lions deserve our respect
to make this 100% accurate we have to convince chris to sell his channel to get donnarumma in the video
fun fact Chris forest won against arsenal
If Donnaruma was the goalkeeper this would be the best video on youtube ever
thing i like about chris is that when he is sponsored he doesn’t just keep the money he gives other people opportunities to win the money. what a guy
What a penalty by Chris , that’s was an absolute worldy as was Theos
Imagine just getting a notification saying that u got 10k
Alex wasnt that bad tbf
10:11 chris is so hysterically short its a meme 😂😂
what does MD stand for?
Chris you kinda spoiled the video at the start by showing that only 1 person choose stand up and later showed the clip of someone doing stand up
Tbf nobody wanted Chris to win
imagine steventries goes on that stand up thing 😂
that's cool, now do it against Donnarumma.
A agon being conor editing the model part😂😂
"im getting the 10 grand, its my channel i need to win for once its what the people want" -chrisMD😂
He said friends
Is he ok
Blm and alm  the players  don't deserve the hate
This is literally the most stressful video ever
Forza
REEV is just a awesome guy
Connor who edits does an amazing job
Theos pen was the best ever hes done
what a video
Connor is a legend tbf
Pieface is the nicest guy on yt
No one gonna mention there doing this in Peckham 🤣🤣🤣
I want Chris to win.
massive respect to Alex, even if he thought the audience was booing at him rather than the decision to red card him
I loved this vid so much I was crying with laughter I love your channel Chris
Il gelato lo volete con la coppa?
Squid game
CONNOR=FERNANDES
Pin me if u dare.
WHY WAS ARTISTS LOOKING AT HIM NAKED EVEN GIRLS!idc why he did that!
The stand up comedy actually came out better than expected 😂 The crowd was loving it 🤣
Imagine if your were bald and you had to cut your hair.
Pie was so supportive to everyone even when they missed 🥰
https://youtube.com/shorts/bGkYtg_4GjY?feature=share
Friends… and Theo
Yeah, but you weren’t up against one of the best goalies in the world.
What game is the sound from at 1:21?
Alex smashed it, no clue why they voted him off
Messenged friends and Theo lmao
Theo's pen reminds me Harry magiure's one😂
The servers for ultimate fan servers are down
I want team 1 to win because Sam has the same jersey as me
Why was Alex's audio so messed up??
What if sterling didnt dive and denmark advanced to the final  as they should have
Tattoo is a bit much in my opinion. Respect to the guy. I would never do that.
Stop swearing 🤬
Cmon CONNORRRR 😂
Does anyone know the name of the song that starts at 17:00?
Yo jamie needs to be in more vids
“And that Why we lost to Italy’ lol
Friends and theo lmao
12:44 we've all been there....
great vid Chris, loved the stand-up part
Tell yah what Alex wasn't half bad in the comedy act 😂fair play to him
When in comes to the streamers/youtubers getting the cash. In the words of Jim Cornette "Wouldnt you know who won the pony?!?"
Ngl one of the greatest football content makers out there...every video worth seeing untill end
Ronaldo=GOAT
This video shows Saka and Rashford did just suck
👍🏿👍🏿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽️⚽️👍🏿👍🏿
19.58 Adam Lallana enjoying a bit of comedy
Didn’t think I’d see Chris in South East London😂
I’d panenka it and miss tbh🤣🤣🤣
U posted this on my bd
alex was brilliant🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ll take on one of these challenges please mate 😂👍
why did i feel the pressure
Connor looks like a BTec Bruno Fernandes
"Friends and Theo" Had me laughing way too much for how early in the video it was
alexs stand up was pretty funny
This was brilliant 👏 🤣
E comunque godo ancora
Theo keeps sneaking into football videos
If I get 300 subs I’ll record myself shitting on chrismd doorstep lool
Pls do fifa 22 pack opening
Paying that 20k caused him to switch to Oneodio a budget headset
"Messaged friends- and Theo"  XD
Chris please to a road to glory fifa 22
Next video teaching Shannon as many football tricks in 24 hours
I think instead of rashford saka and sancho, sterling and foden should’ve taken the Penalty shot
10:15 pies face
So he’s not known for being the biggest of people but still I’m almost as tall I’m 13 and my shoe size is 9 1/2 UK
Alex’s stand-up was brilliant
All three forfeits were fantastic
Plz make a video recreating Sunday league goals plzzz 🥺
Just hoping someone tries to Panenka the professional keeper…
Sometimes I wonder how Chris do died
Why did team 2 win when team 1 still had 2 more shots and could've won 6-5?
I feel bad for Connor having to edit this
Sorry, but as soon as Theo spun the wheel and "won" the 10k I clicked off. He simply doesen´t need them. He prolly made more than that simply by his link in your description. Give the viewers a chance.
“His eyes look sad”😂😂😂
Pieface is such a lovely bloke
Notice how all the contestants are white?
How tall is pie?
Wasn't the euro final in 2021 Chris?
It’s just like team 1:lllli team two:llill lol
how to make a penalty shootout enjoyable to watch….
If only Theo got the shave head
Sweet home alabama
we need chris to upload more he is my best youtuber and i miss his great football challenges
Can you do another FIFA series
The stand up was quality! well played
Why is that guys foot green
so many white ppl lol
The keeper was not donnaruma
messaged friends... and theo
Why is Chris just a likeable person.
anyone else thinks chris sounds like horrid henry
No offense but Ultimate Fan sounds terrible. If only 1% of people that watch this video do it, your chance of winning is 1 in 18,000, just from this video alone and that’s without spending money. If you go all out and spend £4.99 you will need to come in the top 50 to not loose out. The odds of that from the tiny 1% is 50 out of 18,000 or 0.277%. Please don’t waste your money, you must realise you won’t win without spending money and then odds are still shockingly bad.
Just me or is it that i swear the title was something like Euro 2020 penalties re-taken or something like that
the guy packed son ;D
So fed up with you tubers promoting gambling
Welp
Everyone talking bout chunks weight loss I swear pie is looking slim???
that keeper was awful. dives way too early
Fun fact:   The odds of the first two players on team one both landing on the prize is exactly 1/10. The odds of the first three players on team two landing on the three forfeits is also exactly 1/10.
The youtubers didn't share their money with the viewers....?!? Thats poor form! Theo seems so selfish....even turning up hungover....kinda rude.
.
Tbf to the lad, he’s decent at stand up 🤣
That’s at my football club
Fifa 22?
now all we need are the fans to attack the opposition supporters and act like racist hooligans at home to complete the picture
Get the feeling pieface needed that 10 grand...
4:30  why is someone eating dude
TEAM SEAS
Please play fifa 22
We need Chris in arsenal
finally a keeper online that actually tries
They could have offered some of the 10k to the viewers that were there lmao
Wouldn't matter, still would have lost!
try mad fut 21 its the same but in my opinion is better
“I messaged friends… and Theo” 🤣🤣🤣
What has this got to do with England's penalties
Alex is funnier than most comedian and all of their jokes were scripted
Bro alex made me laugh more than some established comedians have
Smashed that standup fair play to him i would of shat myself before i could of said my name
I would get a chrismd tattoo if I landed on it. It's not the worst logo and you could add to it to make it even better. I would have picked the ankle rather than the bottom of the foot.
The standup was WAY better than expected!  Fair play!
I met ChrisMd in the o2
New York, Paris, Peckham
Another great video keep up the content you are smashing it 🤟
Now I see why simon said no those forfeits are mad
I just realised Chris looks like Dave Franco
can we all appreciate pies weight loss over the past year
Get me in one of ur videos plz
back ground music at 1:10 ???
Pie doesn’t even have boots on
Still funny 😁
Palpatine looks so much like Nicolas cage 😂
Poor Jack.
#Teamseas
Love pie
nah we like 2 see u lose 3:25
I’m Italian! ITS COMING ROME!
And ultimate fan does not exist anymore... cannot find it in the store
Did he really get mugged?
The calm orange frequently rejoice because session bilaterally face athwart a lavish hexagon. clumsy, truculent step-mother
The dislikes are 699
#teamseas
Your videos 10/10
# teamseas
exept when hes in a a arsenal kit 9come on you spurs!!!)
chris
Peckham atleast there in a stadium
theo changing kit midspin, impressive
that chancellor edit lol
Just a banging video/idea as usual.
It’s not a Chrismd video if it’s not overly complicated xD
So basically it’s squid game but football and not AS bad
looking short there late
Alex literally made me laugh out loud and I loved it
connor looks like the best midfielder in the prem
redditor is amazing
I don’t think people quite realise how huge pie face is like he’s massive he makes Chris look like a child 😂
Redditor is class
Fair play Chris, only one out of 2014 footybanter fifa crop that makes decent content imo cannot argue
Im a Italy fan so this vid was
Pie isn’t the best but he tried his best
They baited the winners by showing the blurred stand up at the beginning as there was only one stand up forfeit
Hi adam
When did pie join you
13:10 name of the song?
All kuntts
Calm down with the ads
Oí Jack! nice top mate ! KTBFFH
Zzz. Zzz.  Zzz.    X.  Did
Why is calfreezy the tattoo artist

That forfeit is fuckeddd😭
The quality of Chris’s videos has always been top class 🤌🏻🤌🏻
12:42 the most awkward high five from Chris 🥲
Massive props for the standup, as someone who has done it semi professionally for 2 years I have to say that’s probably one of the best I’ve seen from a first timer. Definitely would not have cut him short that’s for sure
So the england fans would do better
this video was so well done, editing, timing, just wow.
Theo pulled a Maguire
Please another free kick vid
If penalties were taken by fans Chris wouldn’t be one
Statistically speaking, the team who misses first has more chance to win
An ad came up when sam was about to take his shot!
Ohms
Just realised pie was there
should make ultimate fan available to people in the US
Wanna change the title once more Chris?
Hey Chris can we have you playing Fut Champions with an Arsenal Past an present - e.g. Cech, Van Pirsie, Henry, Kolasinac, Ozil etc.
Did he get the job tho
ChrisMD play Fifa 22
Well this will never ever cumulate the amount of pressure the England team went for
qualityyyyyyyyyy video
And England loses again
Fair play to the lad for actually doing the nude modelling
Amazing video
Imagine spending 20 grand on a video 💀💀💀
Milan -Rio ave
The app is like in Italia with  Fantacalcio
Changed the name I see... I see
ChrisMD videos are elite
You should get danny aarons in one of these videos
Alex smashed it
We knew which team would lose when u showed the clip of the stand up at the start as only one person offered to do it
NOOO 🥺 TEAM 1 lost
The water bottle placement was key
My guy Pie looking thin!
Interesting tactic of spoiling the outcome of the challenge by showing footage of someone doing a forfeit, while there is only 1 person with said forfeit.
Alex honestly did great
What is Bruno Fernandes from wish doing here?
its to late now chris
did someone say crossbar. XD funniest thing ive heard all day
Chris looks 15 compared to the rest of them
does anyone know the name to the outro song?
Video idea: What if England didn’t cheat in the semis
yeah except in this one they don’t have to worry about millions being racist to you
Love your videos mate, you make the best content out there on YouTube
goalkeeper doesn't know how to dive
I got used to the sidemen just making up random cash prizes they never give out, so when Chris showed he paid I was like 😮 for a pen.
A permanent tattoo, yikes.
glad Redditor is here
Outro song?
Play fifa 22!!!!
the video concept is unreal Chris fair play
the video concept is unreal Chris fair play
Anyone else think that’s the dots where gonna give away how many were coming
Sheesh even just watching this I’m really tense, and I couldn’t care less of who won! 😂
I swear chris is shrinking every time I see him
8:00 he legit looks like bruno fernandes tell me otherwise
Wow this is really interesting!! 😂
Did he change the title?
aareee
great vid do more mate
So happy pie face missed
I remember the intensity of that match
Please get some black hoodies back in stock!!
Russia winning the Euros still one of my favourite moment of the year
When Theo said “come on Connor” people that played UFC will know😂😂
Lol FIFA
They forgot to point laser at the goalkeepers eye
You have gotta feel for sam
I see what you did there...👀🤣
The guy doing stand up was actually hilarious, better then most professionals
Don’t think the keepers tall it’s that your short.
i was kinda like "pressure can't be that high" then john was in nets
As an Italian that was one of the happiest days of my life but I did feel bad for the england fans I know how bad you guys wanted it. But you guys are definitely favourites for Qatar
Well they all did better than England and neither of em earn more than 40000 a year!
Two 15 second ads
The rules for the promo sound like a Chris ultimate team series
Great to see a diverse line up 🙄
Neat
Naturally natural neutral neutrally
Performance perform
Best YouTuber hands down great vid Chris
This was fun
OML I HAD SO MUCH PRESSURE FOR ENGLAND
Only chrismd could make a penalty shootout so entertaining lol
As they say, the rich get richer
Make a vidéo with Levy.
beautifully over complicated
PIEFACEEE!!!!!
What a great looking football ground that this was filmed at. Must give Peckham Town a visit!
Why’s the guys feet yellow
Cheaky little pie 💪🏻 Pieface23 you are a legend 😄
I feel like the worst one would probably be the one where they draw you naked , u musts be so self conscious and these different emotions make the time go even faster. U are also extremely worried about them seeing ur dong there is so many things that run through ur mind lol
Stand up was class tbf
Where’s the fortress
That standup was class
IT'S COMING ROME 🇮🇹
You sent 10k to a random?!
Why did team2 win when clearly team1 could still win
great vid lads
England are bad at football
I support for italy
why is nude drawing a thing
PIEFACCCCEEEE
Love abit of bootlegger
Connor looks like Bruno fernandes
no single black person taking a pen...racist if you ask me
10:04 "What a paedophile day?"
why would they vote alex off i was waiting to see where he went with it🤣
Just play fantasy pl
Alex smashed it at the stand up!
why do u h8 cr7 so much
Black goalie is a Blue ❤️❤️❤️
What a comeback!!
22ds
@9:40?
L bozo  Fell off w2s >>>>>>>
Keeper sucked lol
Honestly the no. 10 tattoo looks clean af
Never comment but fair play banger of a vid
Theo must have the shittest hair transplant I've ever seen 🤣
pie face is the goat
So ChrisMD, Theo, and Luke took FAR better penalties than Sancho, Rashford, and Saka..  Not because they went in, but because they were hit firm and placed well.
Chris could you do a video where you try to recreate one of George best goals?
Class act mate as always
So the logic is, if you have to lose a ball if you miss then you score but if when scoring the only thing you get a cash then you miss?
never realised how much weight preface has lost, well done lad
never realised how much weight preface has lost, well done lad
THE KEEPER MOVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That keeper is dreadful
Theo just runs every video these days
https://youtu.be/LlmMLJf6ETc
Love the vid I think England should had won the Euros but that’s what I think
Pie faces pen was really bad that's how they lost
Put me vs pie face because then it's sheffield wednesday over plymouth
alex smashed it wtf haha
Belter
14:24 reev be like do i wanna send this ginger to the hospital nah"
The Stand Up clip early in the video gave away who won as only one person took it :(
John the gk lives in my area
W VIDEO
Am i the only one who celebrated when Chris lost he’s so cocky
Alex looks exactly like Alex Runnarson
10:15 Look at Pies face lol
Chris really be hiring Goalkeepers from his local Sunday league  pitches.
the way he goes friends and Theo 😔
Imagine going on to your phone and seeing you just got £10000 from ChrisMD
I would love to do this
Does anyone know the song name at 12:58 ?
Rip
Even better if you spinner the wheel after  the pens
The infamous beautician jelly camp because team unsurprisingly avoid abaft a ludicrous gum. resolute, scary sneeze
12:43 so no ones gonna talk about that?...
Love the bids Chris!
Can somebody tell Chrismd it’s okay to upload even when you don’t have a sponsor 🤣
How
You should have got random people to scream abuse at them for more pressure
8:16 seeing Chris swear brightens my day like you wouldn’t believe 🤩👑
Best video on YouTube. https://youtu.be/f17xK1KcBKk
That guy was class at the stand up
YESS!!!
this vid is actually genius, takes quite the big brain to think of this
The number of dots above kinda spoil it innit    Edit:nvm
Why would you show someone making a tattoo in the beggining if only one team has that forfeit? Such an obvious spoiler.
The stand up was actually class
Did you get fans to racially abuse the participants if they missed?
10:43 Harry Maguire lmao
Too soon 😢
Chris is the Mrbeast of football
Theo's pen was better than Chris one, also CR 7 is the goat not pessi siuuuuuuuu
I did wonder where that 10k came from
felt like chris really needed his to go in
he has been hiding until arsenal won a game
Big ups, another classic one Chris!
Top 600
Come on Italy!
the best video I've seen in a while I even had to comment haha
fantasy premier league is much better
No one talking about pieface
Chris’ pens are like his uploads, super inconsistent.
Jamie should be a norm in these videos hes great
Can I be in one of your videos
The nude model is awful like awful , i could not do that
0:37 was my first ever pfp in my youtube channel
Did anyone else search for Alex Blanco on YouTube and got really confused
A mude drawimg class
He really said I messaged friends and Theo😂
only one person had a stand up forfeit so the blurred face on stage gave away what team won before it had even started
Seeing the euro 2020 England makes me cry 😢
12:42 That high-fist lol, i hate when that happens.
ofc chris is a deluded pessi fan
Fun fact: Theo took 5 attempts at his top bins penalty
This video was so much better than the title
The upload schedule has gone out the window
That Alex is a be-teck wroetoshaw
Imagine if he put the tattoo in his outro
Im impressed not only by Alex's balls to take the stand up routine, but to actually do well. Kid could go far with it even if the career only started as a bet.
im so pissed the money went to theo
🔥fire vid bruh
Alex was actually very funny
12:42
your in decline big time
Why isn’t pie face in goal
You Know it's A great day when Chris Uploads
I want to see Chris win a challenge
Love to see pie face here
get in there
“Messaged friends and theo” 😂😂
The fact that Plymouth argyle finally gets some recognition through pie face in a chrisMD video makes me happy
Gotta give respect to pie. His body transformation is insane 💪
That’s my football club that I play at
Theo Baker did Harry Maguires penalty he broke the camera lol.
Gud video
Up the Pie
The stand-up was actually really funny :D nice ideas for the forfeits! Although tattoo isn't too bad
8 ads wtf Chris
Me waiting for a panenka :(
Finally Chris last vid was 1 month ago but never the lest an amazing video! 😂🤣😂🤣
Vonner
This is how many times Chris has reminded us about NO.10  👇🏽
The only thing I noticed in this video was piefaces insane weight loss
HIs video ideas are so intellectual
I feel the pressure the players went thru so im not from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 but i thought it should've come home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Class vid
I really dont understand, why didnt you spin after the shootout? Pressure would‘ve been higher without knowing what you get. Overall great idea 😂👍🏻
this crew is goated
to be fair to the bloke he was actually pretty funny
PIEFACE !!
18:27 explain what is below the guy's arm. Tell me that's not what I think it is
Banger
Is that Jordan wheeler?
bro when tf was he in deptford ffs
Great video Chris  All my love for u Theo sorry that happened
Great content
The keepers on these videos are rubbish I am an ex academy GK and can do better than this lot
Get justsayluke in a vid
*“Be honest who else is a few hours late”😂*
Why Bruno Fernandes there bro?
12:43 tried playing it off
chris is the most creative youtuber out there. class.
love a bit of pie before watching him not play goalie
Pie has lost a lot of weight. On ya fella
Very entertaining video 👏 love the content
alex smashed he stand up
Theo is just a knob
Casually sending 10 grand to the wrong person 😂
Hi
Pies weight loss is crazy
I thought the stand up comedy was gonna be bad that I was nervous for him but he was actually pretty funny
But Chris pressures for tires and nothing else
Just me or does he only upload when Arsenal aren’t getting battered? 🤔
Aw yes it's the pieface 🔥
Theo’s rinsing Chris😂
The commentary of the euro final made me sad ,besides that amazing vid 😂😂
England are cheating scum. cheated their way to the final
his voice tryna make it feel mad annoying 😴🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
Can jus hear the overbite…. Jeeez guys
Played that handshake off nicely at 14:56 Theo!
ngl the whole post pen filming, going to the tattoo artist etc, was GREAT and kinda new from Chris
Great vid 🔥🔥🔥
Banger
IT’S COMING ROME
I invited friends…. And Theo 😂😂😂

Too soon
eggplant
The thumbnail needs more color. Not hating, just saying it needs to pop more
These are my friends … and theo
Pie face: ice in the veins 😂
how he thinks of the rules of the game are beyond me
I’m refusing to watch, I love your videos/content but England and summer. No
Brings back horrible memorys
Nice try. But still not enough Pressure!
Props to the Nude model guy and Stand up guy for actually doing it. Takes big balls to do that.
I wouldn’t have that ben
Chris I am so disappointed in you 😔
What a pen by Theo
10 mins after the vid still smiling!
I love pieface
Ultimate fan not available in my country lmao
Nice headphones, I have the same brand lol
Next time recreate the diving :)
PIEFACE!!!
Aight. This is hard to watch. How do YouTubers always find the shittest keepers for vids??
F.M.L
Editing in this video is insane
Omg he uploaded
Alex was amazing. That would be my worst nightmare
Cool video idea
The stand up comedy actually came out better than expected 😂 The crowd was loving it 🤣
Do another video with Steph, will and Harry!
I used to play for Peckham Town… how nice
Is this the sam king bloke ethan hated?😂
That commentary brings it all back ahaha
I had my friends over on that fateful day, all crying, motionless and silent after the second goal and final penalty
Done Theo dirty with the intro 🤣
Connor kinda looks like Bruno Fernandez
We won farley England just hits the post too much
Upload schedule here is worse then that channel W2S...
Schtuff
Credit to Alex, takes a lot of balls to do stand up and some of the jokes had me laughing along too. Big up Alex 👏
Can't wait for my sister to see this...
FINALLY
What’s the song at 1:15? Sounds crazy
Missed you Chris
Chris uploaded
Wish i could hear the dam comedy bit
Bagging vid
I missed your Videos soo much. Great Work and Keep going CHRIS.👌🏻🔥
now this is content.
Love a bit of pie before llosing an important penalty
Fair play to the guys who did the nude drawing and stand up, that takes balls
chris where is ollie
Theo is actually one of the funniest guys on YouTube😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finally an upload
Hi chris you are my favourite YouTuber
Class
banger
Jamie has got humour , funny guy
Anyone else see how short Chris is to everyone else
really is pressure pens
Worst keeper I’ve ever seen
ok
The stand up was actually really funny
What a video
If ollie was in goal this would have been a draw
Class video idea
He's finally back 😂
I wonder what happened in the 3rd cardholders childhood.
Theo is hilarious
Best youtuber ever
Give me a call Gareth
Great video
I must admit it was tough to watch this with the sound on, some of us still aren’t over it chris
Thanks I’m now upset you just reminded me we lost
Amazing
I think its actually still much more pressure for the england players
Feel bad for pie
best vid ever
“Friends and Theo” 😂😂
ChrisMD and Pie is the duo i never thought i needed
Forza Italy 🇮🇹
9:38
Theo baker putting Saka to shame
Third red card person was 100% a teacher.
This vid was insane .. if only this became a series !
Alex actually banged his performance
Jamie scoring two of the jammiest pens to save those orange eyebrows, top class vid!
well we all know chris needs to practice penalties under pressure *cough cough* sidemen match
Only here for Pieface 🐐
Battlefield 5 last battle music
This is so much fun to watch
"joe cole as well" what a goat
can we have a rtg its been so long
I love the addition of pie to the roster
12:42 is very awkward 🤭😬
The actual commentary from the shootout has given me PTSD and ruined my day. Cheers Chris. 👍🏻
Love a bit of pie
#wewantollie
Pie and Reev sound so different on this mic hah, I wouldn’t have recognized them with just the audio
Messi sucks at football
Things that make you might think your concussed  Your dizzy Your seeing things Chrismd uploaded
Nude drawing class is really not that bad 😂

Lets go pieface
Alex activated RVP inside of him 😂
Ngl the thumbnail is a stinker
I need a drink after this jeesh
Ah yes he finally uploads
I can’t be a ChrisMD vid without a sponsor
i love chris' editing style its always been class
L
Is it even a ChrisMD video without no one having a clue of the regulations?
We love a bit of Pie before a missed pen
would gladly come do a video with you brotha
Alex was so jokes
Why is the sound quality bad for the stand up gig
chris u look like shaqiri and have the same style of play kinda mad

ruined the outcome at the beggining
You should try and do a colaboration with Arsenal in the near future. They ll probably finish 10th in the league at some point, so it will be a pitty not to take advantage of that
ChrisMD jut swore in his video!
Chris is back!
I felt so bad for saka in the end. Heartbreaking
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something I shouldn't have seen about  Chris onn loen.Lol again: I only saw the dms, poor girlfriend
