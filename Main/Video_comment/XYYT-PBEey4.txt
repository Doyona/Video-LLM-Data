Especially cause he filed out money to Harry not because as the King knows Harry has no personal love for him prince William his brother or his mother Princess Diana… He rides the gravy train the people’s Princess for attention and money because of those who love the afore mentioned … Harry is a traitor and will sell his soul for a dollar.. which he’s making a lucrative  career of doing…….

A no nonsence manis either you like him or not he will say it as it is like william
Charles himself has done a lot of good work when he was younger.  Yes Prince Phillip was a graat support to the Queen throughout her reign.  He was the strong backbone of the mobarchy and joint family head.  He too did a lot of gojd work as the Duje of Edinburgh.  He listened to ones priblems and ideas.  He started tge Duje of Edinburgh award scheme for young people from school age 11 or 12 yes upwards to their 20s.  A valuable asset tk nany especially those who had no perental skills teachings.  ❤🙏
The so-called current  English royals represent an old institution with a very evil history and are not ethnically related to the original indigenous people of the British Isles i.e. the Celtic. Cornish and Welsh tribes. They are descendants of European royalty, most notably the German Hanoverians, who were also related to the Russian Romanovs, the last royals in pre-revolutionary Russia.  In 1917, George V changed their surname from the historic name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor to make it sound English.  The German prince Albert von Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha was the husband of queen Viktoria, their first son Edward the first British king with the family name Sachsen - Coburg- Gotha, queen Mary was German and the German language was a common thing in the royal family, the late queens father was half German and prince Philip was also German.  Britons regard this so Britishness is about as bizarre as one could possibly imagine.  Also, it is bizarre that some people continue to obsessively fawn over this old institution's representatives.

This king is not special person.
😢I absolutely loved Prince Philip…..so much, in fact, I called my son 😊after him, and never, ever had any reason to regret it ♥️
Descanse em paz cristalzinho e Philip juntinhos agora.
God bless you prince Philip rest in peace sir
Rest in peace Prince Philipp.
Such a hard working man, genuinely cares about people. Watch him when he is out and about and interacting with others. There's no faking his interest in the welfare of others, not like his youngest son.
I always pray for the royal family of great britain

🦁😘😇
Gentle, warm, touching.
While I do understand ones parent can scarcely be compared to a significant other, or in this case a mother of his kids, it's a shame bad he didn't share 1% of the sympathy we just saw, back then when Diana died. Not only that, but he added that infamous sentence "Diana's loss and death has been ... an enourmous....loss..as far as they are concerned." Stuttering all over and being as unsympathetic as one can be.
🙈🙉🙊💘
Get in the house!
Australian People and   welfen    in canarrfon    heard
Everybody knew not his private
Everybody knew

Did Prince Charles sell a  MBE Knighthood for cash?seems a cover up has happened again.
That’s NOT Charles. Charles was debonair Sharp witted egomaniac, who tha heck is this frail and confused clone. Tah tah Charles wherever u r.

One things to say about the Royal Family. When it comes to speaking, they are sincere in their thoughts and speech. However, when you hear HM, HRH Princess Royale Anne and HRH Prince Charles, talk about Prince Philip, the depth of emotion that reverberates in their voice is exponential. The love Prince Philip must have given them must have spanned to the highest heavens and travelled to the furthest galaxies because the love they have for him cannot be hidden. My condolences for your loss Prince Charles. I know you're still hurting from the loss of a great man. We won't forget him- not in this lifetime. Blessings.
I am not crying.      You are crying.
HRH Prince Charles 🙏💕
It's too bad that Charles has decided to go against his father's wishes regarding the Duke of Edinburgh title! He has chosen to disrespect Prince Philip in one of the worst ways! It's too bad he didn't have the courage to speak prior to his father's death. I believe it says a lot about his lack of character. Hmmm maybe the apple doesn't fall that far from the tree!
HRH Prince Charles 💕 wonderful and beautiful hearted person 🙏
May his soul rest in prefect piece 🙏🙏🙏🌞🌞🌞♥️♥️♥️
Princess Diana said that Charles had been mocked by his father because of his protruding ears and had been fought all the time
@₩€ker !
Sad and all but can they hurry up and arrest Andrew already
Thinking of the poor queen god love her how sad this is for her.god give her strenght to carry on  a great great women she sure is
He's soo lucky to have his parents for so long!!!
Well done, Charles.

So sorry for your loss may he rest in peace
Go tell megan and obama
Isn’t it odd for the uk population that a women, who is way past her retirement age, doesn’t give her crown prince son the throne?   Media is  just praising her for her sense of duty.... but I see it as lack of parenting skills with her kids having one big scandal after another!  The fact that Charles is already a grandpa himself is just making the whole world laugh!
Looking so close, you can only say that they are indeed father and son, they look so alike
Prince Charles: 'My Dear Papa Was a Very Special Person' title suggests he says it, doesn't...
En ces moments douloureux, je veux offrir à   la Famille royale,   la prière du '''''' NOTRE PERE chanté de Vendée'''' (youtube musique de ma compo) , en souvenir de nos  royautés parrallèles jusqu'en 1788, date où la Vendée a sollicité énormément la royauté britannique pour maintenir son Régime....sans succès, et pourtant la Vendée sud-Loire a donné beaucoup de son sang pour Louis XVI.
I lost my dearest papa when I was just 18 and I still miss him dearly to this age .. I just turned 40 .. not to be able call the name “dad” anymore still feels weird to me ..🌸🙏🏻
Those who have mothers never get old. - Kazakh saying.  Prince Charles is still young then
I must say father was an agreeable chap, I shall miss waving to him from a respectable distance. Tah.
bpaβο Prince !
your father was aman feathfol  polite put  you are not aman you are not polite  without sence and have right seeingfor futcher  you are crimnal aginest your both sons  think for past what are you done . man dont cheat his famly  espeachly daina .....
What a sad performance...u are a fake evil person
Lovely speech Charles
This is the moment you came here for 1:03
THE VAMPIRE IS DED.
You are lucky to have had him for so long
HRH Charles looks really sad.  I send my condolences to the royal family. from Saudi Arabia.
Rest in peace Prince Philip. God save the Queen.
He seems like a sweet man.
( ɔ ^ ◡ ^ )っ  YES. OUR GREAT DADDY PRINCE PHILIPP is A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.  💖💖💖
R.I.P. Prince Philip.
Charles can be an excellent king.
Couldn’t agree more regrets
It’s difficult to imagine this buffoon being King one day.  Good Lord! 🤷‍♂️
You ruined Diana’s life
He can’t be king he’s divorced and married a divorced.
Your papa philip killed your ex wife
❤️
The Prince is a good solid man.
🙏🙏
Well said Prince 🤴 Charles !!
Clearly not Charlie
Honestly as much as I’ve never liked Charles for his past with Diana and Camilla, you cant deny feeling deep sadness for this man. As the queen and princes eldest son I can only but imagine how he must feel. You can sense his sadness and after coming back to this clip from the live funeral I can definitely say you can tell Prince Charles was deeply emotional. God bless our beloved queen and her family ❤️
Charles : you are a poor guy, you are a wife, you are a very special person.
Zaczyna cierpiec. Ale to jeszcze za malo. Za grzechy mlodosci zniszczenia pieknej mlodej zony. Jak moga Brytyjczycy go tolerowac za to co zrobil z piekna Kamila. To jest nie wiarygodne. Ale wszystko jest w rekach Boga. Los sie msci i tak bedzie....

Never heard of prince Philip speak before , and Charles sounds so much like him , wow amazed about that , my condolences to his family
Yes. Indeed he was an amazing person. our thoughts and prayers is with you  and your family Prince Charles.
🙏🙏
Scary somehow
How long are you going to keep lying to us? When will you finally admit that the moon landing did take place, but that what we saw only took place in a studio in Hollywood...because you could not have explained to the people that during the flight to the moon ufos were constantly to be seen on the picture.
Thinking of them with sincerest condolences. Thank you Lord for letting me live in this great age and to all whom fought for freedom. Losing loving parents is so heart breaking. May God our Father comfort each as they march on as Dear Prince Philip would want. In Loving Remembrance,   Sincerely, A Widow, Daughter, Sister, Granddaughter, of Soldiers
🙏🙏🙏
Mes condoléances Monsieur!
I am so glad you had a dad how loved you . I  didn't you are the best 🤣😊
yeah, he was a special person - - - waste of space, that's what he was..... racist, hypocrisy knew no bounds, same as old big ears....... runs in the family, wish they would abolish this bunch

My deepest condolences!
My dad passed away 16th december. In his own way he was Royal. I miss you Papa
😢🌹🙏😔
Let's be honest... He wasn't Philip's favorite child.
May the Lord Jesus bless you all. Kind Regards
Now try to understand your son's lost.Now Prince Charles your in your sons shoes. My Condolences to your family.
Too bad he didn't get to turn 100
rip in piece
RIP. Prince Phillip🙏🏻🪦💔
My condolace  Prince  Charles
Good riddance..
I’ve never appreciated how well Prince Charles speaks without notes until now. Better than any political leader, maybe politicians should receive the same training and dedication members of the royal family are obligated to learn and continue through their lives as public servants, essentially. What a beautifully seamless, personal yet professional tribute.
🤍❤️
Lots of love and prayers for your dear Papa, Charles and lots of love and prayers for all of the Royal Family and the UK.
He will always be remembered.  RIP HRH Prince Philip.

Right. And he wrote the script himself? These people may appear human however its a business they are in together, the 'Firm'. For decades Charles has shared his pain at the hands of his father, who was a bully and  toxic masculinity personified. Hyper masculine. No one heard him call his father 'Papa' until this footage. Of course there would be sadness that no one will see outside the firm. All we see if what they want us to see. Let's not forget when Diana died and the Queen was forced to behave in a human way, otherwise it would have been chaos. The prolonged staring at the end there gives away the 'do you think they'll eat this up successfully?'. He'll be thrilled, privately. We aren't supposed to talk like this because people are emotional and can only think of how THEY feel, not what is actually happening.
Did anyone know he was German???? I did 🤣
Coming out of a townhouse?
he deserves to be sad, considering he used Diana for a breeding cow, and cheated on her behind her back with Camilla and actually ended up with Camilla in the end after everything that happened which proves he was cheating on Diana with Camilla the whole time.... so why not just leave Diana alone and not use her to have kids for the royal family and produce an heir, if he had just left her alone and been with Camilla who he really did like instead, Diana would be alive TODAY
I am stunned on a mourning he said queen - and not mother. I am perplexed - He said Papa. why not Mother,
The pain of losing a father is like a spear stab in the heart
Oooooh I’m just like daddy! Racist bigot xenophobe  Who loves Jimmy Saville  Ooooh
Looks so much alike his grand’ma!
God bless HRH Princess Diana forever and always. Sleep well beautiful Princess...We will NEVER EVER forget.
My grandfather died in 2019 because of cancer. I can't stop thinking about him and his life. Everything remind me about him. So I understand the pain and thoughts in royal family. It's hard... It's always hard 🕊️
Rest in peace Prince Philip.
Yeah indeed he was. The world's greatest plaque unveiler.

pffff
Harry won't be saying that about you Chuckie, given the way you abandoned him, your daughter-in-law and your grandson.
I’m so very sorry for your loss!
Nicely said.
It is a terrible loss, but at age 99 should it really come as a surprise? I don’t mean disrespect, the death of a family member would never be easy no matter what. However, I probably think even Phillip knew the end was near.
Wasn't he friends with Jimmy Saville 🤔 and the chairman of Chatam House.. anyone anyone, see the irony and connect here.
"My dear papa was an abominable racist"
*Another Mountbatten bites the dust*
How old is Prince Charles? It’s amazing to see families whose children are well in their 60’s/70’s and both the parents have lived into their 90’s/100’s.
Sorry for your loss
aw.❤❤❤😭 so sad. loved phillip, he had a hard life.❤❤❤❤ RIP
Za koga se uda Dijana za njega i jeste kamila.

Sorry bout your da sausage fingers, truly!
Prince, were is you princess?
Он тоже отца расстроил отношением к Диане,пусть не оправдывается!
Yeah, it's because he would reincarnate as a deadly virus to solve overpopulation... Congrat...

What a lot of mistakes you made in life Mr Charlie,.........looks like your mum and dad didn’t teach you that much about life.  ....... or else,...... you were just a very bad student
The love story between the queen and prince phillip is so beautiful. To be with your soulmate throughout your lifetime is the best blessing she could ever have. They were both so blessed. May he rest in peace and may god cover his family with a lot of healing and loving energy.
can we get diana back as an exchange now
oh God this was sad...
Sorry for your loss.
I think when the queen goes , it will be an even greater blow to the world , for she was true and faithful to her people and duties ,,  she walked in grace ,, she will be dearly missed ,,  and God help the world when they are both gone ,,
I will miss seeing the Kingship next to the Queen ,,
That seemed sincere ... hes a great public speaker and his upcoming  tenure as King is closer than ever l   finally.
I think Prince Philip was a true King in His own rights ,, He was lovely ,,

How did he taste?
Poor Charles 😢😢😭😭
oh my god the doors open and close as if Willy Wonka is speaking to the public.
No really dumb prince Philip was rude person in past !!!
Princess Diana was also a very special person!
Prince Charles: I wish it was my mother. 😂
Love his accent.
Him and his dad killed princess Diana
As much as a great man Prince Philip was, Prince Charles will be a greater man.
Nonces
❤️🇬🇧😔
Warmest regards to a most outstanding person who has always been awesome, and Loved.
Why do they all live to be100 and everyone in britain,  Not royal lives to 60?
You can tell Prince Charles is holding back his emotion.  Big loss for his family. RIP, Sir.
70% of britain sent their parents to old homes & bring good breed dog, 20% of britians dont know about their parents, 10% called my dear Papa
"My dear papa you are special " sounds of his heart ❤💙💜💖💗
My condolences to all the family members. God bless you all.
Prince Charles looks Like Prince Philip's brother.
😛😛😛😛
What a robotic speech didn’t hear a drop of emotion in it, suppose he’s happy the throne is just within reach
My lord since prince Philips death I’ve realised how little I know abt the royal family I thought this guy was the queens husband
පර සුද්දො
Lost my father back in July I know pure pain I pray for them
The fact that his dad was 99 and he's in his 70s wow
I am sorry for your loss, your royal highness.
Love from Italy
Philip was a remarkable man who never boasted of his war record, his immense impact on the ecological campaign, the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, nor any of his other achievements. He was an old school gent with a great sense of humour and concern for the world in which he lived.
So sorry for lost of your dad and your mom Queen Elizabeth my heart goes out to her and family Prince Charles he makes me sad to see your face so sad I know he was a good father your mother Queen Elizabeth may his soul rest in peace because he had a kind heart just makes me so sad he almost made to be 100 prayers go out to you about rest in peace
Awww A man in his 70s saying "My dear Papa " is sooo sooothing nd cute to listen to..aww prince Charles stay strong ❤️
What a totally useless human being Charles is. As useless as his father. He ruined the life of Diana. The only worthy member of the Royal Family in recent years. Both Philip and Charles have pared on many occasions in full uniforms with medals that they have never actually earned in service. To compound the disgrace of the Royal Family the BBC have now given airtime to the the disgusting Andrew. What a rotten country the HK is.
Simple man.
🇬🇧👍❤️
🙏🙏🙏🙏❤
We have to pray. eternal rest grant unto him O Lord and lights perpetual him may he rest in peace amen!
Sorry but Ur dear papa was a racist person and so r u! What u did to Diana
A special nazist !
He is a very gentle human being.
I didn't hear him mention the 10 children that he and the queen took from a home in Canada in the 60s and they were never seen or heard from again. Funny that isn't it.
Sorry for ur loss
El no va a ser el próximo rey!
Just such a magical soft heavenly class of people... Charles  The heart wants what the heart wants.. We are a family of duty... Duty is the death of love. and  Love is the death of duty.
So true, he gave up so much for our Queen and country he was a national treasure 😥❤️
He was indeed....a person who carried out so much and was so loyal....I for one appreciate everything he has done to help her majesty and the UK and commonwealth...he was a true conservationist ahead of the times and will be missed RIP sir
he looks so sad I didn't follow the royal family but that doesn't mean I can't empathize with them at the death of prince Philip😢
Both guys are wonderful. Prince Philips and Prince Charles are one of the kind. PP was a wonderful aviator and he wanted to do so much in life when he was young.
Didn't shed a tear or lose a night's sleep when Diana was murdered.
how come 30k people care about Prince Philip but tho 1.3k don't
Соболезнуем, держитесь в вашем горе.
Like everyone
I still don't want him king.
🙏🏻
Yes Phillip is love Phillip feet will be missed on this land
After 70 years with her loyal husband next to her, Queen Elizabeth must be feeling a bit unmoored right now, like a bird who’s wings have been clipped. RIP Prince Philip.
Why pappa
🙏🌹
So sorry for your loss.  May Prince Philip R.I.P.

Heart touching message from HRH Prince Charles.
Like what kind of people downvote this? I lost my father when I was 18 and still miss him in my late 20s already....
Rip to the longest serving man the gates will be wide open rescept 🇬🇧👈✌️
Extremely well said.
To Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Prince William and your families. You as well as England are in our thoughts and prayers. May God give you the strength to get through this trying time. We are so very sorry for your loss.  Sincerely,   Mr & Mrs Hart & Family  Pennsylvania  United States of America
wrong! my dear " princess diana" is a very special person haha just kidding
Somebody must be cutting onions... 😥😢
You could see he really misses his father, even at this age
Condolences for your papa. May god give you and your family patience and help you. As this world is quite temporary and everyone of us go from this world like your father. It will be great if you can use your influence to bring peace to third world countries where they have war.

My sympathy to you and the Royal Family, your highness. May your father rest in peace. From the USA.  God Save the Queen!

If my ole Man hit 99 before his demise I’d be pretty philosophical about it ...
He didn’t like his Father.  This dude is pathetic!
Have to say the actor playing him in The Crown has done an amazing job to recreate his style of talking.
He will always be remembered...
This guy looks troubled
Charles is really aging fast now. I just doubt he will ever be king as the Queen is in such good shape; she could easily live another 10 years. It's going to be so sad when she dies.
Join the freemason/illuminati for powers,protection,riches and FAM with instance 200 million dollars into your bank account.
May he rest in peace . amen
Prayers and condolences for You and your entire family during these sad times. Grand respect and admiration for your Father and the Queen. May God grant you peace and  comfort.
he's going to be a classy King.
What a classy man. Very sweet, unrehearsed comments about his father. Rest In Peace Sir. My father, too, would be 99 if he were still living.
gente
I'm so very sorry for you and your family's loss. ❤️
An amazing blessing to have him 99 years.
Your family is in my prayers 🙏🙏🙏🙏
So sorry for your great loss...
Thoughts and prayers Charles
I am so sorry, I wish we could let them know we care and not force them to make statements or anything and just be there for them, but that's just not how the world work these days. But we are here for you all and please have our hugs and thoughts 💚
ESo.no debe excistir mas...chauuu.   Corona...ja.
so sorry for your loss....
That creepy smirk, is devilish.  And thats our future King, my god.  Harry for "King" All Natives from the Commonwealth back "Harry for King".
Much respect to Prince Charles.  Poignant words in tribute to his late Father and Prince of the Commonwealth.  God Bless the British Monarchy during this difficult time of loss.

My dear condolences for your lost.  The duke of Edinburgh was truly an amazing figure of wisdom, happiness and hard work to me. “It is often in the darkest sky we see the brightest star”. Your father’s body may be gone but his spirit lives on in you and all of us. No one is ever truly gone, like a wound often leaves a scar. My greatest wishes. Imogen
I really liked that not a single reporter asked any questions after Prince Charles' statement. There is still some decency in Britain.
Losing any of your parents is tough, you gotta take it slow for a while.
He will be missed. R.I.P.
Long Live The Queen. Long Live Prince Charles.  I am sorry for the loss of your Dear Papa :'(
I'm glad you had your father for so many years.
I am saddened by your recent loss.  Please accept my sincerest condolences to you all at the present time for the loss of a most central and integral member of your family.  My hope is that you will find comfort and strength together with each passing day.
He looks like his brother
Ja heel speciaal hahaha
RIP
Smart door. The door has been brought up well. I'd like to know how well behaved it is? Opens on approach

Royal Family & England need to stop its smear campaign against Prince Harry & Meghan Markle .. Here in America we have a right called "pursuit of happiness" and I support them as well as an American 🇺🇸 they are not beneath *any* of you , I myself am *NOT* beneath you either. #FYI
Why is the royal family so beloved by all of us??

1.2k dislike....ok....I just wanna talk
I feel for the guy, it’s always hard to loose your dad, but I hope they skip him and give the crown to William no way he has the credibility to lead the nation.
I'm so sorry for the royal families loss. My dad died last year 4 weeks before xmas. My thoughts are with the queen and her family x
Oh no! Anyway.
Yes you are all very special people.
Rest in Peace.
Since Papa the rest are idiots
may his soul rest in peace
😢😢😔🙏So, saddened, such a great loss. He is, a wonderful model for generations to come, he served his, nation and his Queen. I loved and admired him, and my heart grieves his loss, along with his family, and specially thinking of HMTQ, how hard it must be for her, no matter how strong and prepared she might be, losing her pillar of strength, a half of herself. After 73y of marriage. I don't imagine my life without my husband of 20y.that's nothing compared to Her. May, God help her, and Bless Him, may the Prince rest in peace, and God bless his family and help them in this time of sorrow. I pray for them, with all my heart. 🙏😢💔
Muy sentido pésame para la Familia Real desde Panamá, paz a su alma 🙏.

I didn't realise how WITTY and funny prince Philip was till I WATCHED HIS BEST MOMENTS video...may he r.i.p.

Man and his legacy!!!!
Lost my dad at 19 worst pain ever! Doesn’t get easier either
Our condolences to the royal family, I can tell he is really sad, I was a teenager when I lost both of my male grandparents, they were as tall as prince Charles, I remember them with love, they were great people. ❤🙏
💙
Much love to U Charles.. our Queen and both William and of course our Harry.. stand strong always.. love Australia..x
He has that look of loss, no matter that he is a grandpa himself. May the Lord comfort you.
ЧАРЛИКУ ВСЕГО 72 ГОДА , А ВЫГЛЯДИТ СТАРШЕ СТАРУШКИ МАМЫ.....
Your Pather is Lucifer the Zangano .
È lodevole l amore di Charles verso suo padre, forse Harri dovrebbe imparare qualcosa da lui. Le mie più sentite condoglianze a tutta la famiglia reale inglese.
My papa.. what a ponce, the man was a massive rasist.
Boooo
Botox?
💟
Prince Charles looks dreadfully distressed. A sad time.  Papa is now sleeping with the angels.
💖🌈🙏🙏🙏💖🌈
So was mine !
I wish Charles could have been more like his father.  Maybe then DIANA would still be around... just like Prince Philip wanted.
he was a good father-in-law,had cotton planted for Meghan in the royal garden  :-D
We the people of Myanmar are very much saddened about the loss of the Duke of Edinburgh who visited Myanmar .
The papa  was a very special  person and you are a nasty cheater.
Losing one of the world's greatest Eugenicists is indeed exhilarating.
I do feel sorry for there loss but what about all off them loved one has died from covid
He was a much better man than Charles will ever be.
LE MIE CONDOGLIANZE PER LA PERDITA DEL CARO PAPA
Love listening to the royals talk. Very sophisticated 👍 RIP
God rest his soul in peace  My father died age 42 years i was 3 years ,   my love of this life my dear mum died age of 51 . You're so lucky to have both parents
inbreeding clouds the jugdement
Why is this the first time I’ve heard him speak

Your father has a beautiiful spirit soul that is eternal!
Lots of love to you all. Very saddened by the loss of your beloved dad. I lost my dad 3 months ago and my heart is still hurting 💐
Upřímnou soustrast celé rodině a hlavně královně😭😭😭

About time
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imagine having to make a public statement while mourning for your loved one. I can't imagine how difficult that must be.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜💜💜
Anger or joy the guy kept a strong face. Healing hope at this time. There are so many things that need healing.
Rip ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Although I very much doubt any member of the royal family will see my little comment here, I’d still very much like to say how sorry I am for the loss of HRH the Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh’s passing. For me, he resembled what Great Britain is all about. Dependable, strong and constant. Such a marvellous man who touched so many. My thoughts are with Her majesty the Queen, and the rest of our wonderful Royal family. The family will need to recruit a new most experienced plaque unveiler now. Such a brilliant person who spent almost a century doing things for others. Remarkable.
Sorry
An eloquent and thoughtful statement by our future King
Descanse em paz , querido Príncipe Philip, você foi um exemplo de dedicação ao serviço, de cuidado com a instituição de superação de adversidades.
My deepest condolences to the British Royal family and citizens for the demise of his Highness Prince Philip. May his Soul Rest in eaternal Peace
I still have my mum and dad still in good health into their 90s. It's a special thing but I feel for Charles and especially the Queen. ... time waits for no man.
I never meet my father because He leaves me. But I could understand what "my dear papa" means:(
Rest In Peace very sad he will be missed
may god comfort you Prince Charles when my father passed away i was not right and crying and crying for about 2 yrs  off and on nightly and with some rest in between sometimes and then realized it only gets worse if you think about it so thats all i could do is stop thinking about it and move on as heartless as it sounds and also everyone will seem very heartless and very insensitive about your loss during this very difficult time so just be aware of that and God bless and you and hugs.
I love how he always refers to others in his remarks--kind words about his father, gratitude to those who have recognized the loss and expressed their sympathy. Total class. And totally unlike the whining, self-centered behavior of Harry and Meghan.
May he Rest in Peace 🕊️
He sounds like Josh😂😂 Oop I mean RIP Phillip
Meni čudno što si ti živ kamoli onaj šejtan od 99 godine
No he wasn’t, none of you are good people, quit lying to the people.
Rest In Peace
I am very sorry for your loss Prince Charles. Never easy to lose a parent at any age. God bless from Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, USA.
its not like he was really a father to him anyways
May God comfort the royal family with this great loss!!God Bless Them!
God's grace and his mercy 🙏 my condolence to the family
A comment in tribute to everyone we have lost this past year😔 Stay strong folks, we will get through these times 💖
Having trouble remembering the lines
This kind of loss and sadness is something that we all have to deal with, and it hurts.  By all accounts the Prince was a good and decent man... may he rest in peace.  Hopefully the family will draw strength from each other to get through this difficult time.
special person go read our newsletter, he was a criminal....... there is no real royal family they are gone, TRUMP [military tribunals] fun to watch! awesome 👍👍😎
'My Dear Papa Was a Very Special Person', those words came from the depths of his heart.
Love from 🇨🇦 much respect
Why is he describing his father as some sort of outsider?...
Dang! I thought he was his father😮
He enlisted in WW2 he will be missed. RIP
Pure evil !!!!
as above so below, indeed.
Spitting image
He sacrificed children then ate them
No les creo nada!
What a lovely bunch of people in this comment section.. Love to all. May you all be blessed 💕💕
‘particularly’
The left hand in pocket, means Satan's hidden hand with us.
I am sorry...R.i.p.
Touching.  When he said 'my dear Papa" it took me by surprise.  I had always thought that was an ethnic reference like Eddie Fisher's 1950's hit "Oh My Papa."  Eddie Fisher's parents were Jewish but Italian families also identified with this song.
Q
"Prince Charles" very sorry for your loss. Hope you have great support. Lisa
Of course he was..he always knew where is his place..3steps behind his beloved queen and wife..had a long life besides her and family..he deserved all that..RIP...
So sorry for  your loss, praying  for the family .
😔 R.I.P. PRINCE PHILIP
-Misogynist -Racist -Ties to Epstein -Supported human genocide WONDERFUL MAN!!
When he said " My dear papa" I teared up, he was an amazing man for sure. Sending lots of love an prayers from the US!
Gentile Principe Carlo, ricordo quando venne in visita a Trieste nei primi anni '80 del secolo scorso e la vidi passare in automobile per la via Cellini, mentre ci salutava. Mi dispiace ora moltissimo per il Suo profondo dolore. Ma Suo padre Le sará sempre vicino.
He was special like everyone one is when dead. Like the rest of the family, he didn't realise it's the 21st century now.
he sure was, in a very bad way. now pls get the other one also, lets be rid of this nwo elite leaders
Царствие Небесное р.б. Филиппу!
His voice is like anesthesia...the level of class the royals speak with is so captivating. RIP Prince Phillip.
Why don't they just talk about his value to them, as a family, as opposed to trying to magnify his importance to the world? We know he is a figure of prominence, but his death, more than any of those 'stately aspirations' is essentially a personal loss. Stick to that instead of projecting him like some larger than life world figure head that the world mourns. That's irrelevant. He was a husband, father, grandfather, great Grandfather etc first and foremost. That's where his real value lies. Not as some hero of the world.
Ya llegará tu hora viejo tirano
I’m so sorry for your loss.
Charles, Classy and dignified, will be a great King
Yes, the gentleman, will be missed. There's not many people with character left. RIP.
Riposa in pace principe  Fhilipp❤🇮🇹
Revelation 19:21, “The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh."

All royal families are deep involved in all the wars and make billions with the military industrial complex. Watch the docu : Shadow World , from Feinstein.
Its all about the pass away Prince Phillip people who comment nasty about Harry and meganh should have so respect to the royal family
Warrior God of Vanuatu lives on forever <3
Take the L
Thats not even prince Charlescrap
Your dear Papa is very proud of all the family he so dearly loved.  We are so sorry for this great loss and along with all the world, we will remember Prince Philip’s wonderful contribution to so many and so many nations.  He will never be forgotten by us.  We are praying for Her Majesty the Queen and for all of you.
Charles looks exactly like his mum
Again a hard moment for the royal family of England RIP
lol
My prayers are with all of you .Can you give the Queen a hug it really helps.I love your Queen I wish her love and support
A very dedicated...Royal family member who is respected by not only by his family...by the Global...Godbless the family. during this time...& in time to come ...we are all feeling...& to loss a loved one it is normal to shed...many tears from South Africa....we are all supporting the the Royal Family....Godbless
1:32 who tf opened the door?
My heart goes out to Charles, this was very moving
M'y respects to Prince Charles and The Queen!
Was an other génération, We cannot critic Him. Respect.
God save the Queen and comfort her during these sad times.
❤️✌️
🥤
How did the door guy know exactly when to open the door when charles finnished his speech? He was peeking into the key hole, ease dropping.
THANK YOU Charles for such a personal tribute and in person! He is missed!!
Why not just make this guy the King now. He certainly is ready.
Pretty sure that's the 1st time I've ever heard him speak. RIP to his PaPa.
A true gentleman & great husband to The Queen 👑 RIP 🇬🇧♥️
nobody asked tbh
I’v never heard him speak.
Have you noticed how old the royals die they are looked after better than anyone yet they offer nothing to the people. People Starve everyday on the streets of London yet they do nothing. I hope you all rot away
Rest in peace!
I can see the pain and sadness in his eyes. RIP HRH and Long Live the Monarchy.
Your dear Papa was a leached that derived his life off of the poor citizens of your oppressed country.
The past few weeks, I've seen some really nasty tweets and jokes about Philip , Charles and other members of this clan, but at the end of the day they're all just a family who didn't ask to be born into all of this...regardless of what you think about the monarchy, this man was a father, husband, grandfather, and great grandfather...so show some respect..we all have parents too and they are precious to us...so respect other people's parents. Unless Prince Philip knocked on your door and personally insulted you , you have no reason to be trashing him left and right. Charles and his father grew closer later in life...I wasn't a Charles fan growing up but I really hope he can take care of his mother the way his father would want him to. Lots of prayers for the Queen.
Much love and condolences to the royal family   I’d like to offer a quote from my great grandfather when he was passing ( aged 101)   “ it’s not going to be a long goodbye for me but to you it’ll feel long eventually when it’s your time I’ll be there with open arms and tell you welcome home and I missed you “
He was a great man who helped a lot of people and he didn’t need all the hassle of Harry and Meghan as his health was suffering god bless you and I hope the rest of the family help the queen and each other through these sad times
Yes your dad is an amazing man for staying loyal to your mother. As a good son you should have followed their lead but I guess past is past. You can't undo what happened to Diana. Condolences to the royal family.
even diana was a very special person, what about that??
imagine you have to call your mother queen instead of mom
RIP dear Prince Philip. Such and admirable man. Prayers, peace and love to the Queen and her family in this time of grief. God bless.
Très honorable Prince Charles  Windsor,allô! Il nous est particulièrement émouvant de composer ce message et nous voulons l'exprimer à l'espace des commentaires dans Youtube.

Does he say Papa because his father had greek heritage?
Father , 🙏
I do like his automatic door opener & closer .  I sure hope i can pick up one from Walmart before their all sellout.
I think he did well to make a statement. Not sure if I could have done that with millions watching.
Mi sento partecipe del loro dolore ,la famiglia reale britannica ha sempre avuto un ruolo importante nella vita di tutta Europa,  mi spiace davvero grandi persone lasciano grandi segni ed insegnamenti un buon viaggio al principe filippo di cuore ...
It's so sad
The lucidity in his words, v heartfelt ❤

Surprisingly, Prince Charles does not have a strong English accent. He sounds more close to American English than other British people. LOL

There is a famous character, a Google search for "signals walter bulls". He made a fortune for himself back in 2018. Recently, such services have appeared that allow copying the results of professional players. This guy shows how to copy after him automatically using such a service. We must try while the market is on the rise!!!
He looks a lot like Prince Philip.     Doesn't he.
God Bless you in your time of grief

There are so many who have so much to say about Prince Philip. Some positive some negative. But one thing you can't take from this man is his loyalty love and Devotion to his wife.
Something my heart aches for knowing my babies will feel this way one day. Although its sad, im proud to know im going before my babies😔

You can talk to us Charles 💖  We love you too ✨
My sympathies
Those who rail against the Duke's son are no better than those who betrayed the Duke.
If only he showed this much sadness to our Queen Diana's death  Well losing your father must be hard my condolences to the whole family .
PÖBEL KING  PROTEIN 55
I envy the man. He's had both his parents well into his 70's with him. I'm sorry for his loss but still... I do envy him. P.S: What are you supposed to do in these cases? Send a like that his father passed away or a dislike? But would the dislike be considered as not caring whether his father died or not?

RIP sir.
I think of King Edward VIII compared to his brother 'Bertie'. I think of Her Majesty the Queen versus her sister Margaret. Then there is Prince Charles and all his siblings. There is something quintessentially outstanding about the way the heir to the throne speaks and their poise. Charles never climbs stairs, he glides up them. I am in awe of this man's class. Sincere condolences Your Highness.
Our condolences to you and your family in your sad loss of HRH Prince Philip.  May he Rest in Peace.  He has been there as long as I can remember and things will not be the same but you will learn to be happy again and remember the great and funny times with your Papa.
Awwwwww that’s so cute “my dear papa”  ❤️
And then you didn't listen to him
God bless him he was such a great person . Good bye  dear grandpa
Good.....
Funny to see how the British still peasants of the royalty 👑 😂.... Not as brave as the French
RIP Prince Philip. 🙏🙏🙏
Sorry for your loss royal family harry hope you are ok.
How they closed the door properly when he got out and opened exactly when he was done and ready to come back. I wonder did that door man put his ear to the door to see if he is done. There was no one in window to see.
Who was his Dad?
He was a special person
I’m so disconnected -I clicked on the video thinking it was a thumbnail of the deceased   edit: no, I don’t remember his name
The human condition, knowing when we're born that we're going to be burying our parents. Not knowing when or how, just knowing it'll happen. And still, when it does, it leaves us unprepared and unwilling to accept it. Treasure the life you live, and treasure those around you. On hearing the news I held my loved ones tighter, and my heart sank, knowing that your family is now going through what mine did when I was 18. My thoughts are with you and yours.
His dad had personality the rest do not
I am not a fan of the Royal Family but they've lost a husband, father, grandad and great grandad. I hope the family get through this period in their history. Let's not forget he had a very long life and I wonder if he was looking forward to a letter from his wife.  99 is an amazing age and he must of seen so many amazing things around the world. Rest in Peace Phillip

I lost my Papa 22 years ago. You don't really get over it but you do get used to it. My condolences to all.
I'm enjoying your lose hahaha up the ra
Tan impersonal. Tan sin sentimientos. Tan raro, como la puerta que se cierra al final. Pobre Diana, fueron tan indiferentes con ella. Son como robots.
I respect
why do i feel kinda bad for CHARLES😭
cap
My sincere   and deepest condolences  for the Queen and the Royal  family ( and  my wishes to Prince Philip rest in peace)
F prince Charles. But I do feel bad for him
I am so so sorry for your loss your royal highness. May you find comfort in your family and friends and know we all grieve the loss of your father with you. 🙏🌷💕  Prince Philip need not have been surprised by the enormous support and outpouring of love. He inspired it by being he was. A true Prince and companion to HRH Queen Elisabeth.🙏
Thanks to him that Diana is gone
Rest In Peace DMX
I feel so sorry for the Queen...
Prince Charles you look so different !
The friendly sand secondarily prevent because cow finallly fancy past a ordinary appeal. aquatic, guttural H habitual currency
You killed Diana!
what kind of fools would leave a negative or thumbs down on this video.
Can’t even stand to hear his voice, vile person charly
He looks like a goofy character from an old cartoon
Now that Prince Charles has a more demonstrative role as the male at the head of the family, and supporting his Mother, one hopes he will be firm with his son Harry and put him right concerning his actions and decisions with his wife. May this time prove to be one of unity and bonding.
Prayers to the family, this is such a tough time.
"Losing your father is like being a soldier on the battlefield having lost your commander."  ~Turkish saying
Wish the royal family well from here in the states as they go through this trying time. I hope the queen is holding up well through this.
Rest In Peace
That was nice.
When my father died I felt nothing, I'm sorry for their pain though, I cannot imagine what they are going through.
Our ex president wasn't even  the dust under Philip's shoes.
The queen and her loving consort, have touched and helped the entire world.  Not many men could have walked this course...in fact...I believe he’s the only one.  I knew he would not last long after his month in hospital, however, his passing took me completely by surprise and I will miss this cranky old man!
Condolences 🙁🙁🙏
I wish I had both parents until I get old but my dad smokes so he’ll probably be dead by the time I’m in my late 20s or 30
He was a racist
Imagine calling your mom “the queen”. The royals are just sad people tryna be happy.
Awe, Charles... Poor, sweet man. He's heartbroken. A thought of comfort and condolences to the grieving family and our darling Queen.
I'm so sorry for yr Loss Prince Charles my Condolence to the entire royal family😭😭☹
It so good that his dad watch his son grow up till he was 72 some dad pass away when there kids are young
Prince Andrew still needs to go talk to FBI
Rip, but at least he doesn’t have to wait that long to see his dad again
Rest in peace.
He maintained a excellent  husband role .But  You arnt !
Nobody in the UK refers to their father as my dear Papa...
Admiro a la familia real.
Next up to never be king...
He lived to 99 ... Was diana given the chance to live out her natural life??????
pac
My heart hurts for him and his family ❤️😢
Prince Philip was unique. He marked an era. This is the end of an era.
The prince is looking down at all the love that's being given...What a wonderful human being.  ❤
the royals are hiding their racism
Our love and prayers to HRM The Queen, HRH Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and the Royal Family in Great Britain. May the precious memories and the love of many around the world support you in this trying time. 🌹🌻🌷🌺🌷🌹 Love and respect from  Canada 🇬🇧🇨🇦🇬🇧🇨🇦 🖤
RIP prince Philip

Wonderfully touching...😌
Sorry for your families loss
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the next king.
God bless the family
God Bless and guide all of you with his guidance and love.
Anyone who has lost a beloved father knows how it feels, I’m an American commoner and Prince Charles has my sympathy here.
Loss..what an awful thing for anyone to experience. 😔
God bless him and the Soul of his Papa!   God bless the whole family.  Amen.
Well said.  We have lost a great man.
Sheep eat this up
It's a shame to see all the kids making fun of the man...
My heart goes with your family. Especially the Queen, it will be very hard for her to lose her long term partner.

So sorry for your loss 😔
Your papa was bad person 😌🛍
rip bozo 👎😹👎
I feel sorry for queen Elisabeth and prince Charles it’s always sad to lose family
He was a Very special person, to stand beside and behind the queen for over 70 years and supporting her like he did.  It's not easy for a man to be second behind his wife, but he did it and I think theirs was a great love story.  God Bless the Queen! She will need you so much during the rest of her lifetime.
And......Good Riddance!  More to follow soon...
Prince Philip will be remembered. Rest easy.
100 years old!! Lived longer than most!!
“Very special”...
My father was a special person too
HELLO, WHO KNOWS THE QUEEN AND CHARLES ARE DEAD. STOP FEELING BAD FOR MURDERS. TRUMP TOOK CARE OF THESE NAZIS. THEY ARE ALL GONE. IT WILL ALL COME OUT WHAT THESE SICK NOT HUMAN  THINGS DID. THEY WERE REPTILIANS WHO MURDERED PEOPLE AND CHILDREN.
God bless him. He’s a son who has lost his father. We’re witnessing a family and a country in mourning. I send my deepest condolences to all who are impacted by the passing of this steadfast, supportive and amazing gentleman.
The world has lost their  Papa.... Our hearts are broken.   👑     ❤      👑
Well said
I could hear the emotional loss in his voice as he came out to thank everyone.  It was on TV.  I believe the Thanks was given to all around the world who morn the loss of Phillip.

My sincere condolences to Queen Elizabeth and her family. May the Lord give you strength and serenity in your hearts. 🙏🕊️🌹
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
He will be missed.
So sad to hear the heartbreak in Prince Charles voice.
I'm sorry
Tan especial como tú desgraciado que planearon la muerte de una mujer maravillosa.
Once this guy become the king. The royal is doomed. End of another monarchy
Lizzie lost her Prince😪
To lose a much   loved father is such a great  loss.... heartfelt condolences. ..... may he RIP  ....
I'm so very sorry for your loss God bless you all and comfort you. Dear Queen my heart aches for you...
It broke my heart when I heard Prince Charles said "my Dear Papa".  My heartfelf condolences to the Royal Family and especially our Queen, Elizabeth ll. May our Lord shower his blessings upon the family and ease the pain in their hearts. Prince Philip was the love of the Queen's life and her rock and she'd miss him terribly! I pray that the Lord will give her the strength to cope each day. He's no longer with her in person but he'll always be at her side or a few steps behind in spirit.   May you rest peacefully Prince Phillip in the loving arms of our Lord; God bless your Dear Soul 🙏🙏🙏💐🌺🍀🌹🌼👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
I can't believe that in this day and age so many people around the world still admire and support such a primitive and archaic system/concept as "royalty". This world truly is so full of ignorance that it is disgusting. Ugh..
Please accept our deepest sympathy for your loss.
Rest In Peace !!!
Our hearts, prayers and condolences go out to the Royal family... who gives so much to the world.
You can tell he just finished tea and biscuits. :'D
MONARCHY MUST DISSAPEAR‼️

I’m not even a fan of Prince Charles, and this made me 😢
Sorry for the loss of a father and a husband, may he rest in peace.
So sad
Beautifully said  , with class dignity and respect.  RIP
Oh my goodness your father was needed above just as much as we needed him below. Amazing grace we had him for so long. His now wings shall protect you for ever thy kingdom of Love. 😇
Very few people at Prince Charles' age have even one parent left and he was very blessed to have both for such a long time. Prince Philip seemed like a wonderful distinguished gentleman

I lost it at my dear papa
We thank Him and all your family for your kind and unwavering and unselfish service.
I wish mine was
His sorrow shows .. when I met Charles he was charming.. his eyes a beautiful blue ..I thought our lovely Diana looked into those eyes ..
How sad he had to address the nation .your farther is by your side
No matter how old you are when you lose a parent it’s devastating. Many prayers to the family.
Doesn't matter how old one is, you're never ready when they go.  It's unfathomable that they are here one day and gone the next.  A blessing though when one gets to have them this long.  RIP  Prince Philip and all those we  have lost in the past year, including my own father.
i would feel bad but i hate this man with everything inside of me
⚘🥀
“My dear papa was a very special person who despised everything about my personality and way of life. The feeling was mutual. Can I be king now?”
🙏🙏🙏
🇺🇸
Yes he taught you how to bury jeffree epstein.
Prince Philip protected England😔 Thank you so much for everything. Please, rest in peace😭
When he said my dear papa , i thought of the passing of my own father and i felt quite broken
Yo Chuckie after Mommie croaks you’re next.  Satan awaits you!
yes, he was also your uncle
Okay but he was still a racist and sexist. Just because he died doesn't mean anything.

Its sad that they have lost a loved one. What saddens me on a different level though is how the Media cant seem to refrain from dragging other past drama into this. Umm.., They lost a loved one folks! Why is some other drama the "story" here? Isn't it worth the "story" that they had a long happy marriage? Isn't it the "story" that they loved each other for so long? Isn't the story that a husband passed away and left a loving wife and family? Why is the other drama even relevant here? Seriously!!
Sorry for your loss.
😭 What an unfathomable tragedy. And so sudden. Why is it always the good one's that leave us so soon? I guess Billy Joel was right. Well, Rest in Power, King !✊🏾
To prince his family's and friends i want to send my condolences to entire love ones. Thanks you share moments with your mother went watch them they always together now she losss her soul mate i know this is heart .be strong god give the strength get moving on i will pray for you.
It was a very nice speech by Prince Charles it does help if you are older when your parents die . especially if you have maybe less than 20 years yourself to live like Charles I’m not particularly a royalist . but I have to admit that Prince Phillip did work his behind off and He and Princess Anne are very alike she is outspoken and very hard-working like phillip was . I feel sorry for the queen of course but she will have phillips body nearby and I don’t see her wanting to leave that castle very often it’s a comfort thing and him being  near by i think it will give her great strength . of course the queen will miss Philip but again at her age she really shouldn’t go into a deep depression its just not worth it is it but then i remembered Prince Harry is coming over to see her OH GOD 😱
His brother, Andrew, is also a very special person in an entirely different context.
Receive his soul and present him to god the most high...Amen and give his wife the Queen of England strength to be without her soul mate bless
He looks like he aged a lot in two days.

Oh he was special all right. Especially racist.
My heartfelt condolences to Queen Elizabeth and all members of the Royal Family, the world has lost a remarkable person but faith teaches us that our departed loved ones are always near us, they are not absent, they are just invisible and they look at our eyes full tears with their eyes  full of the light of Out Lord Jesus Christ in

last thing you want to do is make a public statement about losing your father. the pain of loss in those first days is unbearable to think about let alone talk about..
He seemed like a great man.
Father like son💝
Gone too soon. He had his whole life ahead of him.
It is sad, however, the man had a very very long life and a royal one at that. May he Rest In Peace.
Rip
my condolences! In that, we're all the same.
CGI NOT REALLY HIM!!! THEY QRE EVIL PEOPLE !

Interesting that He is not wearing any military awards. Here in Germany If U receive a higher military award ( have no Idea about civil awards but would be the same )  they also hand U a miniature version what is expected to be worn , if more than one than the highest, on Your civil clothes on special occasions like this.

My condolences ❤. Great loss
Phillip and Charles, great men!

Bless this dignified family . How fortunate for the english people.
How can give a thumbs down. Disgraceful attitude
Your Dear Papa was a racist.
Very brave to speak the cameras. It must be terribly hard for him. Deepest sympathies to him, The Queen & The rest of the Royal Family. 😭🇬🇧
Never met him, but saw lots of pictures of him. Was HUMILITY Personified. Goodbye Sir.
So sorry Charles love to you all 💕💕☘️☘️🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🙏🙏🙏
Prince Charles, you are a Credit to your dear dad, the Duke.

My Sincere Sympathies to Queen Elizabeth  & family, may you all find comfort in the legacy he left to the world, he was an example for us all in righteous, goodness and bravery, R.I.P.
Es una bendicion,tener a sus padres hasta que uno este viejo tambien. No muchos en el mundo,pueden tener ese privilegio.
Those of us who have lost our parents understand. God bless them all.
Lol
Sorry for your loss payers for the Family
Most definitely an incredible man.  May he rest in absolute peace with angels at his side.  God grant HRH Elizabeth II the strength to continue to be the powerful symbol of strength, leadership and hope that she is.
Are this the people that were worried what skin color a baby would've come out?
Is that it??? Lost my dad in January age 93. I could have done a better job than that. I liked the Duke who my dad met during the war. For god sake when the Queen throws a 7 put princess Ann in charge.
Dude looked like a ghoul from Fallout 💀
Ok but why do we still care about monarchy?
Words that fit❤💕 to all who lost their parents - children all over the world 🌐 from  privileged to poor miserables ! Thanks !
Everyone says HRH brought the royal family into the 20th century since. he was impeccably royal yet had a rather difficult upbringing and had "the common touch". It would be hard to imagine our royal family without him
Rest in peace🙏🏻
So sorry for your loss. Prayers for you and your family.
Woke people disgaced Philip in some  right after he died!?
Prince Philip😭🤧I'm very sad... 🤧
Are comments being deleted? The whole comment section looks so weird.
There are no words of comfort that eases a heavy heart loosing a parent at any age. All the messages of condolences you can repeat a million and one times over till the same words ring in the ears. So sometimes its best to be silent. They know you mean well by just saying nothing. Our soveign and the family feel our love and support surrounding her. And yes it's ok to not be ok you are normal with feelings too.
Give the jewels you stole back to Africa
My sincere condolences....god save the.....Queen......
RIP Prince Philip
God Bless.
Gracious words. I'm glad they are feeling the love and compassion of the people. Many share in their sorrow and are praying for their comfort and the sustaining peace of the Lord.
❤️🙏🏼😢❤️
I know how you are feeling I lost my dad last year and it's still raw.
Well said Prince Charles. My deepest condolences to you, the Queen and entire Royal Family. We mourn with you around the world. R.I.P Prince Philip.
The Duke wanted to reach the 100. So he got his dying wish?   I observe his death was not random but an arranged affair.  The Duke had no need of any heart operation.  Astrals  (Spirits)  around were advertising his imminent departure by causing the missed heart beats.  He wouldn't have taken kindly to having his heart played with and stopped.  He was being tormented by these manipulating entities.  He had an inner fury against these ...........  They  went against his will ; which is criminal.
🇬🇧🇺🇸👬
Dear Royal Family, This is Britney & I would like to send warm hugs and cuddles for calmness and prosperity during this time. Regards, Britney & Gang (The Cat)
A message ❤ To all those who suffer  💔!
Jesus loves you.
Racist
We are with you Prince Charles, don't let those who despise your family for no good reason get you down. Across the world, people in different countries revere the Queen, Prince Philip, you and your son William. Do not let all the talk that people think you shouldn't be King get to you, I myself along with many people around the world, all believe you would make an excellent King, Your Royal Highness. I say this as an American.
Oh I thot he was the one who died 😂😂
Don't want to underplay the feeling of a loss but y'all aware that due to shortcomings or protocol, Charles never grew up close to his father and their bond might not have been warm since Philip was more often than not high handed with Charles.  I rather feel this message was a courtesy.
My dear papa...? What planet are these people on ?
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them🎈
Who is looking out the left window?🤔
I can't get over just how much bad luck they have had in the last while.. Rest In Peace Prince Phillip 🙏🙏🙏
RIP HRH Prince Philip
Sometimes I forget that was his father, cause he looks just as old as his mom and dad!!
So sorry for the loss.
Why were Philip's brother in the SS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kla1AOC24Dc
Philip father died in 1944. His mother princess Alice died in 1969. His lost surviving sibling died in 2001. His youngest sister died in a plane crash in 1937. She was only in her 20's. her family also died in the plane crash as well she was also pregnant!.
💔
Your papa was indeed a good man. You on the other hand....
Our hearts go out to your entire family! Heartfelt condolences!
So sorry
isnt this the man that was racist towards asians multiple times and colonized them
A man in the shadows who served England unselfishly for over 70 years. Best described as true dignity. God speed.
Deepest sympathies Charles to you for the loss of your Father, and your family's great loss.
Amazing man!! R.I.P to Prince Philip, war veteran. UK owes this man a lot!
Lovely words from Charles at such a difficult time.
My dear Papa sad😪
My condolences Your Royal Highness,  I feel your pain. God bless
Prince :DDD He is like 90 years old.. Awesome age to be a prince xD
THANK YOU Prince CHARLES for Your Gracious Statement. 🙏🇺🇸
😄
Proud Prince Charles. Stay strong 💪
Sending love and care to your family from Gloucestershire 💕 may you find peace in your hearts
He lived a great life, and his life was well told and documented. What else is left at almost a 100 years? Of course he will be missed, but there was an air of fait accompli about it, and I think he realized himself, that his time was drawing nearer.  The Queen will feel his abscence more than anyone, and it may hasten her passing also at her age. R.I.P. Kings and Queens are mere mortals too...
Our deepest condolences to the royal family. May his journey to the next life be blessed and at ease.
So sad to see Prince Charles in this condition:( blessed
Giving thanks for the life of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. May you rest in eternal peace, Sir.

Who cares !!!
What a beautiful heartfelt message, God bless the royal family.
Royals are weird.
Am more sadder for my dad passing away last year then for a royal.Couldnt care less about Prince Philip can't stand the man.
We are mourning too.
can’t imagine having to provide statements to the public at such a painful time.
Never liked the royals only liked Princess Diana and the royals killed her.
why didn't he wear black?
May his memory be eternal ❤️
We should all be so eloquent.
What is his Legacy ? is it the man behind the woman
Dear Prince  Charles,  my deepest sorrow and sympathy it's a Heart breaking . My condolence  to you and  to  all Family.  💔
😢
God Bless you all and one day you will all see him again ..his love for family will bring you all together
Prince William should be King not Charles MB
When he come out someone did open the door to him,and when he come back someone did open the door to him,but he had to close the door himself.
Another hypocrite within the "Royals", he was a cheater all his life, and his father sadly allowed it, :>(

I just realized that I’ve never heard him speak before. Sorry for their loss. Hope their family is doing okay and I wish them well.
💖
While I cannot stand by alot of Prince Phillips actions, I pray that his passing was peaceful and calm.
Per la scomparsa del Principe Filippo di Edimburgo, le mie sentite cordoglianze a tutta la Famiglia Reale e un sincero pensiero di affetto alla regina Elisabetta. 🙏🙏🙏
He'd NEVER have been supporting the WEF GREAT RESET , UN AGENDA 21 / UN AGENDA 2030 , 4th Industrial Revolution and Zero Carbon 2050 now being ushered in under the LIE of COVID-19 to bring the WEF COVI-PASS DIGITAL ID IMMUNUTY PASSPORTS in which are going to be the tool the Globalists PLAN to use for total control of populations and the Bill Gates funded experimental gene therapy injections
My sincere sympathies!
Every father is a special person to someone, so please do not make him a saint. I wonder how many illegal children are running around in the world being fathered by him? BTW with that kind of wealth and staff behind me, I can also be of service my entire life to Queen and Country, nothing special there.
💔
The way they speak.  So posh.
Sorry but I do not honestly believe most people are mourning your Fathers death. Most people are aware of your evil family and what your about. The world has woken up in 2020 and your plans to enslave humanity are back firing on you because many are turning to God now out of fear, seeing the hand of the spiritual enemy working through families like yours to bring about the new world order.  I'll be back to check if this comment is deleted. That will only prove everything I have said above.  Bye.
I deeply respect the Royal Family and express my condolences to them in connection with the death of Prince Phillip. With love to Britain from Russia.
Rest in peace, Prince Philip. Heartfelt speech by Prince Charles.💛
We have put our flag at half mast in respect. RIP.
The future king!
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Philip bullied Charles. There’s no love lost between them. Let’s stop pretending they were ever close.
How does that door open on its own?
RIP
we  all know it was you who commented on Megain's babys skin color.  Carmella is evil, but she does not care.  It is not her grandchild
He was an excellent man,  we are praying for him.
To me he exuded strength and confidence, they dont make them like Prince Philip anymore. RIP from an admirer from America.
God bless you all x
This is the video message I like best from the Royals. Prince Charles is very sweet and charming in this video. A warm embrace to you Prince Charles.
Thank you Sir, we loved him too, he supported her majesty for 70 plus years. We as a nation will not see his like again. We share your sorrow, most of us though out our lives, he and the queen have been a constant. May your papa rest in peace.
A moment of silence...  Please for once, respect a dead man for once. To have some deceny and respect.  RIP. Thank you
Prince Charles your father Prince Philip was very special.❤️❤️🌹
I love Prince Charles
Rest in peace
An all -round truely remarkable great man who will be missed by the world.  Rest in peace always.💚💚💚
Thought he called him a bully?
WEAK
💐It is saddened to learn the news of the death of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. I would like to send my deepest sympathy and most sincere condolences to Her Majesty the Queen and members of the British Royal Family. May His Royal Highness rest in peace!🌹
Rest In Peace Prince Phillip, all my thoughts are with our Queen and her family♥️
Prayers and condolences for the Queen, you and the entire family!
Wow he speaks exactly like josh o connor
Wait aren’t they supposed to be wearing only black
It's never easy to lose a loved one. Even when you know it's coming it doesn't get any easier. You can see the pain in Charles' face and you can tell it took every bit of emotional strength he had to speak those words. Thoughts and prayers go out to the Royal Family.
That was sentimental ❤️rest in peace Prince Philip 🙏🙏
Сочувствую.😢Это так тяжело терять родителей.
Well said we much appreciate our parents and elders when they are alive..😍 enjoy their company and life experience of knowledge.. God bless us all 🤩
You all are in my prayers.

And you're next !
I am starting to actually like Prince Charles .  I am American and never cared for him. However watching him handle the death of his Father is very touching and endearing .
One less evil person on Earth
Diana would have been alive .. If not for your ego
Your dad was just great ...Nothing like you Adultery
❤❤❤❤
God Rest the Duke of Edinburgh- 🇬🇧👑 Prince Phillip's Soul 😢😞
The Royal Family is estimated to be worth $28 Billion, Philip's wife paid £1,337.62 last year in council tax for Buckingham Palace - That's less than a one bedroom flat in Manchester - gotta love the royal family!
He wasn’t even this sad when Diana died
From all that I've heard HRH Prince Phillip was a great father.  That he was really into and about his children.  That is a character trait that he can rest in peace knowing he fulfilled to it's greatest extent.
Очень жаль, мои  соболезнования 😥🇰🇿
From appearance he looked like handsome man. It was funny/lovely couple to see but further more I don't know them by character.
Ese es un viejo descarado le pegó lo tarros princesa Diana y va ser principe
Thank you for speaking to us Prince Charles- I and my family send our condolences to you and your family at this sad time.
Killed millions of people in Indian subcontinent!
it doesn't matter your age, and it doesnt matter who your they are, the loss of a parent is always devastating. my heart goes out to their family.
So wonderful, he was with her all those years, guiding her and following with grace🇺🇸
Andrew got some nerve to be talking, his deeds are what cause his father’s demise. Smh
He was an amazing man. Very sad😢😢😢☹️☹️☹️☹️💔
May he Rest In Peace
Amazing speech Charles... I used not to sympathize him because of Diana's drama but after watching the Crown and be more aware about the royal family I realized that he deserves to be happy. Everyone makes mistakes and he received a lot of backlash already. He is a great guy and will be a great king!
So sorry for your loss of your Dad. Prayers of strength 🙏💔🕯️🕊️
Died on his wedding anniversary
So very sorry for your loss
PRINCE CHARLES my prayers and condolences to you and your family. BELINDA SNYDER
May I offer one's condolences Duke of Edinburg death to Prince of Wales.💐
So sorry for your loss its never easy losing someone u love. Sometimes it makes u wonder why we are here in the first place... sending lots of love 💘 an hopefully in time abit of peace in you're hearts 💕 so brave to come out&say something when in so much pain. I don't know why but I've always felt a connection with the royals reminds me of my nan to. As she had a chance to dance with Edward vlll as they where friends. RIP PHILIP 🙏
Prince Phillip 'dies' age 99 on the 99th day of the year yeah right He faked his death becos long-lived Elites are giving the game away that they're taking Life extension therapies--which involve stem cells--fetal tissue Notice that his cousin Ivar Mountbatten commented about the funeral plans--"He's having the last laugh"
Prince Philip lives on as a shining example the world needs.  May you all know God's comfort as you traverse this year of first hurdles, and beyond.
He was quite a character It was reported he sat thru the coronation reading the bible and not viewing the ceremony Causing the archbishop to say afterward  rather rude of him
Yes we'll miss your dad
I wonder what David Icke thinks
I'm Irish I must honestly say all his family conducted themselves very favourable whilst in Ireland so sad occasion
God comfort your hearts .
Susunod ang Queen sa asawa nya
He meant a lot to several worldwide who never knew him in person,a very worthy individual,a loss indeed.
Medkänsla för Charles.
We are heartbroken.   Our thoughts and prayers go out to the royal family. May God comfort and console you through this difficult time. 💔
Er ....... "My dear Pa-pa"?????????? Can't get more 'Public School' than THAT.
My Condolences to the Royal family. May God Bless you all.
Prince Philip stood above the rest of the Royals. Sad to have lost him. May he rest in peace.
Do the Royals earn money other than being on the Dole?
I’m so terribly sad for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and all her family and I offer my deepest sympathy for your loss.
RIP Prince Phillip.may ur soul rest in Eternal peace 🙏🏼
So sorry...
R.I.P Prince Philipe....❤️ Please stay strong The queen majesty.

May Prince Philip rest in peace.
And life goes on.
Only here to see the comments
Watch the crown
You can see how sad he is. From the way he’s speaking to him looking down and around, this hit home. My condolences to the Family. Philip was one of my favorite members of the Family
Very respectful man we loss
Royal Salute Fung
And a good father evidentally.  RIP
This is the first time that, for me, I see His highness...Charles....as himself a person.  Sending all the light, love, strength, and peace during this time.  😓😥😭😓
É più vecchio lui che il padre quanto é brutto, come ha fatto Diana a prendersi sto mostro
Such a sad time .
this royal family should hold the mouth--
Too bad. Another racist bites the dust!

I totally agree....  He was GREEK.. Hellenic blood
The country is thinking of the royal family at this very sad times not some money seeking attention seeker in the USA
As a random Dutch person I will remember Prince Philip fondly <3 Best wishes to all who mourn his loss.
When your Dad dies.. you go back to being 5 years old.
99 years, 2 months shy of 100, that's a good run. Amazing! It's good Prince Charles addressed the people. Can't help but to think of Princess Diana & all she went through, when I see him. I see Queen Elizabeth being strong enough to deal with the loss of her long life partner. It'll be difficult though. Prayers to the Royal family. * They've been such an iconic statue, you just kind of always expect them to be there! 😢
Rest in Peace Prince
What a bunch of suckers
My heart and my prayers go out to the Royal Family. My very deepest condolences to the Queen. I could not imagine being married to a man for 73 years and then him not being there anymore. Please, Queen Elizabeth, stay strong, and my The Lord GOD watch over you in the days to come. Your loss is felt all over the world.
Really sad to hear about prince Philip's demise....all my deepest condolences to the royal family. May his beautiful soul rest in peace....he will be greatly missed🙏🏻 But on the brightside he's gonna meet diana....and they're both gonna be happy to be in the wonderful company of each other.....away from this world's woes and  ( *whispers* ) also this brat who's referred to as "Prince Charles"
RIP Prince Phillip
My prayers from Michigan USA go to you Prince charles and to the Queen and your family.may he rest PEACEFUL in heaven.
My heart goes out to The Queen and to Prince Charles,may our Gracious GOD give them Peace and Rest..
Let’s just keep it all the way 100. Prince  Charles  your father was the man Diana needed you to be . Rip to prince Andrew .
Prince Charles was never really a man man was he. His dad was definitely a man.
Ist er nicht kürzlich geimpft worden? Besteht da gar ein Zusammenhang?
No por ser.Reyes.NO van a tener sentimientos..sienten la pérdida de su padre..una gran persona..gran padre..y muy buen marido.supo ocupar su lugar..
We are thinking about the family in this difficult time. Prince Philip will always be in our hearts.❤️
''grandfather to the nation'  !!!    Whats next ?   Sainthood ?
How many thousands of pounds are being wasted on flowers to say thanks to a 99year old ?   Give the money to charity and do some good.
IDGARA
Sickening how an old mans death has been blown out of all proportion.  The Telegraph has 25 separate articles today .  Equally sickening to see the  obsequiousness  from the  furlock tugging dimwits to the ''royals''  The royal family is the most  blatant, in your face example of  class ridden  inequality in the land,  and people lap it up.
Prince Phillip  was a REAL MAN-Masculinity ROCKS! My Deepest Sympathies for the Royal Family-Hopefully Harry brings Archie, as Archie DEFINITELY should be at this funeral! NOT Archie's fault who his mother is...!
i can only dream to have both of my parents when i'm 70
RIP HRH Prince Philip. A true hero and a stalwart of the UK and Commonwealth
Hello, is it possible to use this clip on my radio show this evening? I'm doing a special show between 9pm and 10pm, it would be the perfect audio clip to use towards the end
Donot allow that hypocrite megan to his funeral. Cut her out
Why is there still even a monarch?
My condolences to your family Charles at the death of your father. Your father was a very special person in your life. God will help you out in your greef.
To you Prince Charles thank u for your heartfelt update, I will not rest in my heart or otherwise until I see your Mama the Queen live, I need to see that she is ok, until then I will worry about you all. God Bless You in your time of great need. love from me a Veteran and fan of you and the Queen, my greatest sympathies Julie Ann. my heart is bleeding with you all and will continue to mourn the loss of of your Father and our Prince and your Mothers best friend and beloved Husband. God Love You all!!!!!
Принц Чарльз будет хорошим королем
Thank you for your comments...we are so sorry for your loss.
My deepest condolences to the Royal family.  🙏
He died in his sleep at 99 yrs old, why mourn he had a remarkable life and many die and never are remembered,
May   He rest   in    peace  and   lets     always    remember    him as    a   great  man  who   should   be    an  example   to   all   of    us. Sincere  condoleances   to   Her  Majesty the  Queen   and   her   family.
That was beautiful from prince Charles - RIP PRINCE PHILIP
My mom's dad and my granddad lived to get 99 yes old
<3 What a lovely speech, I cant help thinking he looked so frail walking back into the house. Grief can cause physical harm. When I lost my mother my neck was so tense, I couldn't turn my head for a week. R.I.P Sir.
I loves the Royal Family and 🤴 Prince Charles is hurting and heavy hearted.My mom and dad is both deceased their deaths hurted really bad too I know how 🤴 Prince Charles feels and the Queen I know she's really hurt losing a spouse is devastating.
My condolences to Her Majesty the Queen and all her kin. My prayers are with you all during this time of sorrow. R.I.P. Prince Phillip Duke of Edinburgh and thank you for your devotion and life of service to Her Majesty, this country and the Commonwealth. You will be fondly remembered.

My thoughts n feelings are for Her  Majesty the Queen and her extended family as they cope with the loss of his Highness Prince Philip.  Now you can rest in the arms of Jesus Prince Philip. Gods blessings surround you all. ❤️🙏
So very sorry for your loss
Touching tribute sir 🥰
This clownery looks like a movie, the scripted lines I just can't 💀
Simply love his disposition, style, his wonderful smile ... The Duke of Edinburgh ... a well respected figure.
Is that the man who, seems like yesterday, married Diana? Phew!!! Time is a tyrant.
who cares, He will meet Princess diana now
we all understand his loss..lady diana  first wife gone, father gone ,son left..meghan markle  must accept that we dont want her sort back..she took a prince and turned him into a frog.surely she added to philips burden the stress of it all.
I hope God will help you with the pain
My condolences to the queen n to royal family..poor queen😯😯
Our family is saddened by their loss.  Prince Philip was a wonderful husband and partner of the Queen their marriage passed the test of time very rare in these times.  God Bless Carolyn Harwood

What a gent. Lovely family
We grieve with you, the Duke was a towering presence to all, my thoughts are with you 🙏🙏🙏
Our condolences to the Queen, and you Prince Charles, as well as the rest of the Royal Family. Your Papa, would be dearly missed. God Rest his Soul.
Thank you prince Charles,  for the touching tribute. May the Almighty LORD strengthen the Queen.  Amen Amen.
To emphasise, HRH The Prince Philip was indeed an exceptional man . As indeed Prince Charles . It’s just a pity that Charles has been strangled into continuing support for the  dreadful results and consequences of  Atlee’s legislation. The RF supported it wholesomely, with the sincerity of belief that it would work. The ordinary man , t(e man of “ the Clapham omnibus “ has suffe4ed not the RF , so removed from that which they have no choice but to support whilst not living in and amongst the real misery of culture clash which is ignored by simply referring to colour. Nobody in this Nation notices colour , they notice character and when our culture is to be ripped apart in favour of their somewhat ideaology of victim hood and bias  - it’s both too rude and insulting. Our country has values and it was thos values which led them to come here. So be it. A few weeks ago, I was told how much longer I have to live. The initial sadness for my children, grandchildren etc has turned into selfish happy acceptance . I think it ridiculous that one cannot speak out against the foolishness and disrespect for decency shown by all .
Yes, he was a realy special racist
Condoleanțele noastre întregii famili regale, în special reginei și prințului Charles!  Dumnezeu să îl odihnească și să îl aibă în pace!
Prince Charles, such a gentleman and so genuine.
MAY YOUR FATHER RIP🌹💔😢
Man he must be a magician... He can open doors with his Mind.
As Head of MI6 Philip was in charge of the killing of Diana.
As an American who loves the Royal Family, my heartfelt condolences go out to the Royal Family.
Well said Prince Charles.
Thank you, dear Prince Charles.
Rest In Peace 🕊️ Sweet Prince may flights of Angels carry thee to thy rest. 👑💜🇬🇧
Prince Charles gave such a wonderful tribute to his father. Always wondered what he called his father. May God’s grace sustain the Royal Family and the Queen during this time of grief.
So sorry for your loss. God bless The Queen & everyone!
Looters of world
Good riddance of this dark, evil and satanic character... whose death was carefully orchestrated in accordance with the numerology these people manage so well:  99 years, 99th day of the year, 9th day of the month...   nothing is what it seems
God bless the royal family from across the pond. Our prayers are with you.
Carlos es un descarado, que se valla con Camila a otra parte. Que fastidio verlo.
Condoglianze alla famiglia reale  inglese.
Prince Charles did not cry, did not stutter, did not choke. He gave a press statement, yet everyone talks about his touching tribute.
now he gets his punishment before God
It must be so difficult for him to hold back his tears
Sorry for your loss and rest in peace Prince Phillip.
Hes just waiting for his mum to go 😂
To dear of your beautiful parents. Your royal highness prince Charles, It's was amazing that you are 70 years old. Your father was amazing man and live a long life. Please cherish those memories of your family. Please take care of your mother, the queen.
💔😥
Condolence to the Royal Family here in Manila Philippines.  We lpve you all.
The truth is out there
I wish my papa would depart.
Was the mother Of your sons “dear” too? You selfish hypocrite
Please give us our kohinoor and we will also be upset for prince Phillip... #Thief...
Love you all and stay strong
Did he just call us 'commoners'?😆
God bless prince philip
Spawn of the serpent.
Pa pa, not papa, like Papa Johns 🙄
What an amazing person prince phillip. Was. His legacy will live on. He has done so much for the commonwealth..
Indeed it came as such a shock though he had been very ill. I always enjoyed seeing him and admired just how much he supported the queen in every way. Always behind her
Thanks to NAIVE BRITISH TAX-PAYERS WITHOUT A SWEAT ON HIS BROW WAS PROVIDED WITH SUPERB MEDICAL ATTENTION & TO AQUIRE GREAT WEALTH TO A ROYAL PARASITE !. "' Behind every great wealth there is a CRIME "'  (BALZAC)
Prince Phillip was a Prince without a country and made a country his legacy. He lived a life of public service, absent of self interest, a rarity in a world that holds popularity as currency. He knew his worth was not measured in likes but in the support he gave to others so they could rise and shine. Military gave him discipline the structure to achieve. He survived war and the social war of media intrusion. Human faults and flaws rounded out a man firm of character and ready with wit. The Queen chose well with him and he with her. The Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme has meant globally children have been armed with independence and confidence that they can achieve regardless of the odds. His Royal Highness has left a legacy which will be hard pressed to be surpassed. A lovely man to have met. Rest in Love and God bless.
So sad...okay he was a good age...but this is when I realize how much I love my country...because I love the RF so much...he was the o la person I ever saw  when he came to my hometown ...Glasgow Scotland ....many many years ago ...I now have lived in Italy for 38 years...but I am still a British Citizen...and very proud of it too...and in Italy I am only a resident....
Where is Diana, Charles?.... Wait..... 😣😣😣
May your memory be a blessing, Prince Philip 😢
May your soul rest in peace Duke. You will be sadly missed.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Queen and the entire Royal family.  From South Africa 🇿🇦
I feel for all the family especially her majestic our Queen, help give you all strength.
Sadly missed, RIP your Royal Higness.
Definitely makes us feel bad for all the “battery on 1% kinda guy” memes
Condolences for Prince Philip it’s sad for family and friends lovers . Please be strong .
My deepest condolences to the entire Royal Family on your loss. May his Royal Highness rest in peace.
Dear Prince Charles, the Queen, and everyone: I am so sad for your loss which can never be replaced. Prince Charles, you looked awesome and snappy despite your deep grieving. I know you will take care of your mother--the Queen. She will need much support no doubt. With love and prayer <3
So sorry for your loss. X
Charles  looks older than Prince Phillip
Rest in peace, Duke Philip
Condoglianze !!!
Crossing the Bar   Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea,  But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home.  Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark;  For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar.  Tennyson
I did not know we said papa in Britain.

Our hearts are near the family. What a dedicated, smart, and funny man he was! May God rest his soul and repay the sacrifice he did for the UK and his beloved family!
I see Charles's pain, he is really sad... Lose a dear person is always hard, but they have to share their suffering with the world, and it must be very difficult. Much love for all of you, His Highness will be always in our hearts

Does this mean there will be no footy when he has is funeral.  I bet there will be more than 30 people their.
He certainly was, big ears.  A bigoted old racist with disgusting attitudes towards commoners.

Когда мы теряем родителей мы становимся взрослей.
I send too my heartfelt condolences for H.M. the Queen and her Royal family.
I don't know why but the calmeness in the environment and the sounds of birds and door have deep meaning 😥it has some kind of longing and sadness in it. Maybe it's only me that feels it?
💕 from 🇦🇺
I lost my father when I was 7 years old  Then at age  13, I lost my older brother ,which was healthy and young at his 20 .  Then I lost my oldest brother due to cancer,  he was 35 years old  And 2 years ago ,in 2019 I lost my oldest sister due to cancer too ,she was 52 . Now I have no feelings , and I don't know why I'm alive !
My head is hanging low for we've lost, a great man who gave so much for everyone within in the Commonwealth, A sad day for myself, here in Melbourne Victoria Australia 🙏🙏🙏 Prayers for all the royal family.
Prince Philip... was a loyal servant to his family and country. He just 'got on with it'. A great man.
Meghan, I DONT LIKE U
He looks a bit older than his father in some way, lol
I'm sorry...condolences from Brasil
You must be joking??
Thank you Prince Charles for your beautiful words. So sorry for loss 💕
Prince Charles looks so old!
God bless HRH Prince Philip and take care of this beautiful family. Our thoughts are with you all at this sad time. Arohanui New Zealand 🇳🇿
I can see the sadness in his eyes
🙏🙏🙏🖤🖤🌹🌹
Are they really Royal family ? So short and large bonus,  like factory worker family. Shady dealer and beach comber
So many dislikes, we all have parents and if we are lucky enough not to die before them, we all feel the same sadness when losing a parent, my dad died in November 2020, I remember how he had his arms around me, trying to help me to hold him up. My thoughts at that time were, here is my dad hanging on to me. All the years when I was younger he carried me to bed.  My Thoughts and prayers are with the Royals and any one else who has had a loss.
My deepest condolences to royal family.
Count Dracula!!
A beautiful tribute to a great man
Heartfelt condolences to Her Majesty the Queen of England and to all the Royal family members.   From Malaysia.  💔💔
Great person.RIP

So sorry for your loss.
Приношу свои глубочайшие соболезнования родным и близким. Россия скорбит вместе со всем британским народом.

Господи, тот случай когда и так тошно и плохо, а еще интервью давать нужно(((
The British royal family is the vampire of the British people! They do not create any wealth for the people! They're vases, they're ornaments! They're a bunch of hypocrites!
Very well done - it was hard enough for me to speak at my fathers funeral in front of a room of close friends and family - harder still to do it with the whole world watching.
That was very touching and well said. I'm am an American and only moderately interested in the royal family but his death has affected me more than I expected. His death has been in the back of my mind ever since I heard the news 💔.  My thoughts are with the Queen,  her family and the people in the UK during this time.
😔🙏🙏🙏
Losing a parent, I know how he feels. Lots of love to the Queen and the rest of the family 💖
Повезло Чарльзу до 70 лет были папа и мама.счастливчик.хоьь и не пошел красотой и статью в отца.
Prince Philip was a massive loss to us all, ime sure the whole Kingdom, commonwealth & other nations will reflect our trauma during the minutes silence & in respect to HRH for the loss of Her Husband
If he folllows in his father's footsteps, he can go another 27 years! Also, he should grow a beard now.
God bless you and comfort you Sir.
I lost my Father when I was quite young. But despite that I know what ever your age and knowing the reality that you will eventually face still doesn't prepare you when you loose a parent. My heart goes out to Prince Charles and his family. Noho ora mai.
One scrounger less
RIP from Sri Lanka.
Sorry for your loss Prince Charles
Nothing can fill the gap of a father
Very well said and he spoke from his heart. Its always very difficult for a child to loose a parent regardless of age.
RIP Prince Philip.
MY CONDOLENCES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY AND TO THE UNITED KINGDOM 🇬🇧🙏
No matter what we think about the Royals. At the end of the day they are still people. They are fathers. They are mothers. They are children and grandchildren. And regardless of title. They still feel the same pain and loss. Bless the queen and The whole family.
Philip was an open racist and his son is a child abuser whom the family is still protecting. Probably worth remembering before you all flood yourself with tears.
Royal Family 🖕🖕🖕👎👎👎
My feelings are with you 🥲🙏🏻🙏🏻love you Charles 👑👑👑❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️🙏🏻
You now know how it feels to loose your guardian. Now just remember about Harry and William. Rip 🕊️
" My Dear Papa "   who uses this title  today outside of a period play like Downton Abby ?  Its very last century and hardly what you would want to hear from  the next in line to the throne.   His job it will be  to modernize the British monarchy for it to have any kind of relevant  future ,not looking good at the moment.     May his Father/Dad , R.I.P.
Him in his head 1 step closer to the trone I just gotta outlive the immortal one
We love you and him!!!!
RIP most loved prince philip..  Also we hope prince charles never become a king
Prince Charles my condolences.  You have been very blessed to have had your papa for so long into your own golden years. God bless and may prince Philip rest in peace.
I love Charles  and royal family it is his father
God Almighty Bless Our Queen Elizabeth the Second 🙏
they should look after queen elizabeth bcoz most of the times after a death of the husband or wife the other half follows. maybe after a few months or a year or so.
🙏🕊🌹
Nothing drives me mad more than posh people who say 'papa' and 'daddy'.
My condolence with you Prince Charles and  the Royal family.
Oh that’s why you’re with stinky Camilla? Seriously?? Get rid of her already
May Duke of Edinburgh rest in peace

It's touching to see Prince Charles address the world on the passing of his dear papa.  My condolences to Queen Elizabeth, her children, grandchildren and their entire family.   The loss of Prince Philip has touched so many around the world, may he rest in everlasting peace.
Its terribly hard to loose somebody you've loved for a very long time , Bless them all .
My condolences to all Royal Family and people of United Kingdom. May Prince Philip soul rest in peace. Love from Brunei.
Yeh.....what about the slimeball he raised...Andrew! There’s daddy’s boy.....whenever the Phillip came to Australia prostitutes were brought to him constantly........according to one, my aunt
Deepest and sincere condolences for the grieved royal family.
Ai hoho Charles we here u
He was a special kind of evil.
Thank you Prince Charles talking about your father...
Dear Royal Family,I will be with you with my thoughts. IT's always hard to loose a member of the family.  Take care of all of you Prince Philip RIP🌈
Like if some God die.   Ridiculous
My son and I, send our sympathy and condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and family. 💗💗💗
Take care Prince Charles. May God be with you. Your father will forever live in your hearts.
I first heard of your father's passing just a month ago and it's a memory that I shall cherish.  Condolences
May he Rest In Peace.........
A Great Grief.  -  God To Rest His Soul.
Prince Philip has had a tough childhood but turned out to be a strong and dutiful person.
☹️
I wonder did he feel Diana was special 🤔
It's the biggest blessing to have such great parents and Prince Charles himself and Lady Diana and the Duchess of Cornwall are like that too.
Sorry for your loss sir.
Thank you Prince Charles
Condolences from America. Your father was a good man.
Nice remarks. Like Father like son.
Rest in peace ... Prince Philip .. from Philippines
My deepest condolences :(
Rest in peacr
Why don't they renovate their properties? Everything is on the verge of falling apart, outdated. Royals used to be the trend setters in terms of design, architecture etc. Now it's all Mr. Beans parody.
and I wish my Mum would die before I do.
Thank you for your humanity Prince Charles , Son of your father
I'm so sorry for your sad loss, your dad was a one off, a real character who said what he thought, didn't suffer fools gladly, but was also very kind with it, a rare thing today in this ever changing climate. My thoughts are also with your mother, the Queen and the rest of the royal family at this sad time.
My deepest condolences to the Royal Family!💐💖
Prince Phillip was truly a gem in the crown of jewels, Queen Elizabeth wore! He supported her duties while managing their family together. R.I.P.
Such a cold response, trying to sound warm. I wouldn't be able to contain myself were it my father. RIP Prince Phillip.
My condolences... 😔
Ones Narcissist Poppa has died what shall one do? It's such a shame dear old Jimmy Saville isn't still here!
RIP DMX. Forever X!😇

Ahh that was lovely "my dear papa" so sweet.😥
God BLESSED you prince Charles  my deepest condolences
Very lovely words Charles. My deepest condolences to you, your mother and the entire family. May your father RIP.
The greatest art of his life was gentleman behavior which was reflective all the time in his meaningful, graceful, robust  and courageous smile on his face. He  was a very good friend of our Field Marshal and Ex President Mohammed Ayub Khan. A book from him named as " Friends not Masters " was appreciated by him which shows the history.  He will be remembered long time as great person contributed his part successfully for the welfare of human beings. May ALLAH grant him highest ranks and forgive small lapses. Long live Pakistan and UK friendship.
RIP Duke Philip
So so sorry for your loss. God bless you all.
God bless the soul of Prince Philip!
Prince Charles father is and always be amazing guy, may prince Philip soul rest in peace. ❤️😔😭🌹🕊️
...... because in the midst of human-created Covid-terror-related crises, any celebrations involving so called Father-mother-brother-sisters etc. of the nations shall be considered and viewed as deplorable acts by wise and ordinary global folks except miserably ignorant ones including some poor leaderships of virtual thugs. .... the days of wars with guns and nuclear bombs are gone. Also gone is royal era of dark ages! No more repeating of so called world war type non sense and misleading things of less-civilized world of past centuries! .... as the so called 'royal duties as servants of British citizenry' are no longer needed or make any senses in this digital era, Mr. Philip,  a likeable, polite and gentleman of buckingham palace has departed silently with grace just before the Wrath of higher power about to hit U.K. revengefully very hard like a "heavenly but in human-sense, morally upright Boomerang"! ..... .... just wait and see how some world-changing, unprecedented "things of  positive change  srart occurring soon in reality via jb's administration" ....   ..... check for hints in Shahislam's inspirational emails of "success-guranteed-thought-works" sent to bo's desk between 2015 & 2016. Bottom line: so named great Britain is destined to become poor Britain, and the reason is its dishonesty and all the brutal past crimes of various sorts .....
There is something disingenuous about Charles. Bit of an actor to me. It’s like he’s struggling to come up with something.  What’s with the hand always in his pocket?
Thank you your Royal Highness. We share with you this sorrow. Your Father will be deeply missed by many. I am so sad that we cannot see a full celebration of his life as the people would like to however times as such mean we may not. I am so sorry. The Salutes are correct and proper. Thank you. You are the greatest bits of both your parents. Long live the Queen.
This is a beautiful video but I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that the Queen and her husband are cousins.
My condolences to all the family
Prince Charles for your words about your father iknow I had to be hard i lost my father july 7 2018 and I do not go a day without thinking about him.god bless you and your family at this time. Rip prince Phillip.

God bless the Royal Family!
Such a brave man speaking at this difficult time.
Philip was always my favourite royal.
New Zealander here sending my condolences. So sad to hear a true champion passing.
Your papa is amazing man alway kept everything going specially in WW2, since Prince Philip has passed away I watched many films about his life in the navy how he climbed the tree too a successful  career in the Navy . When the Queen your mother how they met the first time ,your mother was 13 years old your Papa was 18 years old ,if your job at that time king George came on too the ship with his family and while he was shown around the ship your father at the time was given the job looking after Elizabeth and Margaret and their mother that was the first time papa and mother met , just think this it would be someone else looking after them. When they married how beautiful your mother was and still is what a beautiful Bride on that special day when they both said I do and now man and wife , when they both went back to Buckingham Palace and both balcony to see her subject the crowds so many full of happy faces and those poor policemen who tried hold back the crowds with out success ,next it when you were Born and the name you Charles to us Prince Charles you were a very sweet baby smiling and your parents so happy then followed Anna Andrew Edward , I  remember the horse and carriage the sport and that terrible fall he had there are lot more that your papa has done for his family Queen and Country . HRH Prince Philip will be sadly. Missed  ,my self I am British and I am very proud of my Country and my Queen GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
Fact:  After Charles and Diana got divorced, Phillip was still in touch with her through letters (because back in the day, Cellphones were not popular like these days)
His reality check is coming real soon !!  Once he becomes king ! I think the queen wont last long either .. its known tht older couples usually die within weeks/months from eachother as the” broken heart syndrome “
Rip to the beautiful Prince Philip
I lost my papa when I was 23. And He lost his Papa in his 70s 😨
It was such an honorable speech about the Father   anybody could only hope to give.
so touch for his lost of papá  regardless of what you as prince Charles have done with your life,i feel so touch by your lost.I don't know Prince Philip but from the media and I ben reading about his life and what happen to his mom, when hi was a child,and his endurance really it was remarkable. the Queen and the Prince,looks that they love dearly.  i am so sorry for all of you brothers and the Queen for your lost. i oldso feel sorry for the lost of  a man like him, it a real true man and a gentleman who fulfilled his Role as a father and support for the Queen and for all England. GOD BLESS THE QUEEN ON HER LOST AND GIVE HER ENDURANCE,TRUE THE REST OF HER REGIME AS A QUEEN❤🌹💔
God bless you all.
I pray for the Queen.

Prince Phillip was a wonderful man.  My prayers and condolences go out to you all during this difficult time of grieving.  I know that there will be so many blessed memories that you all will remember when you think of him and smile.  He is now present with the Holy Lord and will forever be at peace.    I pray that all is forgiven within the family circumstances and that joy comes to all of your tomorrow’s because the Lord is watching over you and we are ALL truly blessed and privileged to have this earthly time to just be present with one another until we each reach the end of our own personal purposes.  May the Lord Bless you and keep you one and all under His gentle, Holy hand until we see Him again and may we “just get on with it” doing our best each and every day! In JESUS’ name, Amen 🙏❤️ Mama Telle ❤️
May God Bless you dear Prince Charles, Your Mother, Queen Elizabeth, your siblings, and children and extended family. Our hearts are with you.

So sad news.😢

It is really a news of extreme sadness and loss for His Majesty was not only dearest to the royal family but also he occupies a special position in the corner of hearts of millions of people across the globe.May his soul rest in peace.He will be remembered by all of us forever
Godspeed Phillip!
God bless the royal family 🙏
Yes, your papa was a very special person. A devoted husband to his wife and a humble servant to the queen. One thing you clearly did not do to Princess Diana.
👴☺🙇🙇
Condolences to The Queen and Prince Charles & family
All our condolences,my god send angels to hold you and your family and comfort you in this time such a big lose god bless 🙏🙏🤗
Deep condolences to Prince Charles n the whole family..May you Dear Papa rest in peace in heaven.GOD Bless you 🙏🙏😔😔😔💖💖
Love you Prince Charles and your dear Mother the Queen.
Rest in peace, Prince Philip
I feel bad for your loss 😭
😔😔😔
Hopefully, one day Harry will be able to deliver a similar speech about his father, without gagging.
Imagine how crude and crass the world has become that when we see someone conducting themselves with dignity and grace, we tend to cling to that moment for dear life.
"My Dear Papa!"  I lost it, what a lovely way to refer to his father.
No disrespect intended, but Charles and Biden looks slightly like they are evolving to be each others doppelganger.
Aww he called him papa 💔
Dear Friend, Prince Charles,  Thank You for sharing your family with the world. We benefit greatly by your examples. May you all regain your strength and firm virtuous footing in the memory of your excellent father, HRH Prince Phillip.
Rest in peace, Prince Philip
Condolences to the Royal family, the United Kingdom and its commonwealth countries.
Losing dad is really heartbreaking😭
We Send Our Condolence To You And The Queen and The Family.. May God Shed Abroad The Peace Only He Can Give Upon  your heart at this time..
My deepest condolences to the royal family
I hope Ur children don't feel t same for how u treated their mother
It is a sad time ! 😔🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
I lost my beloved father two years ago, I feel with you. Wish you all the best.
To my Queen, my heartfelt condolences. 🙏 the mother is the heart of the home❤ The father is the PILLAR. Though he is gone, it will uphold his home ever.
Jesus is w/ ALL of u !! 🙏❤
My condolences to the royal family from America . 🙏🏼
it doesn't matter whether you are royalty or just a person trying to make ends meet. We are all mortals. Thinking that you will live forever is an illusion u have in your minds. Thinking that death is only for the other person is an illusion.   We were born alone. We die alone and whatever happens in between is your making. Your karma.   The question is... Did u live your life full of service and love to all creatures? Not just humans.   The question is....did u learn from your mistakes?   Celebrate life which was in him and got an opportunity to live so long... Most ppl don't have that blessing. Death is but part of life which we all have to face one day. Live gracefully and die gracefully...thats my blessing. For die we must all. Do not be shocked of this constant.
Eternal Rest grant unto him O Lord and May the perpetual light shine upon him.....May he Rest In Peace....!!
It's so sad. Yes, he lived to a good age, but it's still very sad. Rest in perfect peace, Prince Philip.
May he rest in peace🙏 I never met him but I'm thinking so much about the Queen. How do you move on from sharing an entire lifetime with someone to now being alone? May God give her strength 🙏🙏
Royal or not, family is family. Harry should've been there. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family. 🤧
My Condolences. Your in my prayers.
Sending condolences and prayers from America. It is never easy to lose the rock in your family. He will always be remembered for the remarkable man he was. God speed Prince Phillip
My best wishes to you Sir and your family.
My sincerest condolences to Her Majesty the Queen and her family during this most difficult time.  We are never ready to say goodbye to a loved one to whom we have held so close to our hearts.  Sending love to you all from Canada and may Prince Philip rest in peace. 💕

Justice for Princess Diana

Very elegant yet simple statement during an unbearable time.
Rest In Peace Prince Philip
Could not stop watching the BBC1 all day into the night until 3.30am i was in tears many a time. What a wonderful inspiring man Prince Philip was!  Charles and Anne will miss him, not forgetting Andrew and Edward. However, Her Majesty The Queen will miss him most her life long partner, love, and support has left her side, her heart will have a void that nothing can fill 😭 it's the ending of an era that we the public have always known, my Condolences to all the family!!
You are blessed with so much time, and yet still this lost is enormous.  My condolences.
We are sadden for you all...🇬🇧
My condolences to the family! ❤

Prayers for the Queen and her family.
So sad....lovely words.  It seems your daughter in law has added just one more lie....again to prevent her from having to face your lovely family, who welcomed her, when asked by Oprah when she was due, she replied.....the summer....but it seemed today she released a statement that her doctor advised her not to fly as she is due in spring....this woman just can’t stop herself.....H.G. Tudor, expert in narcissistic behavior has posted videos on his thoughts about her and what Harry is probably being put through living with this woman..pretty horrible.....
What a lovely and heartfelt statement. RIP HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh
NONE IS COMPETENT TO TAKE PLACE OF FATHER NOT EVEN GOD. PRINCE CHARLLES ....REALLY A GREAT LOSS.
May GOD BLESS ,& KEEP YOU & YOURS. R.I.P. PRINCE PHILLIP
May Prince Phillip rest in peace and feeling deeply sad for the Queen!!!!

God Grant eternal rest to you Prince Philip and may your soul rest in Peace🙏. Truly you made a remarkable work of all time.Our deepest condolences to the family 👸💗💗💗.Stay strong always 🌟🌟🌟
Such a heartfelt tribute from Prince Charles even though it is often said he did not get along with his father all of the time. So sad that his own younger son could not muster up the time and effort to pay tribute to his Grandfather in a similar way.
A lovely tribute to your father. My deepest sympathy on your great loss. Prayers for HMTQ at this time of unspeakable sadness.
Can't fathom how hard it must be to lose his father and be asked to make a public speech  without showing any of the hurt.
Praying for your family
My. Condolences  to  The Royal Family   From the young family  Victoria  Australia

May he Rest In Peace.
Queens  mother that died   her sister  married couch drive his last name  was partridge    my mom married  Leo  then   had I children  he left her  then she  met   Bernard  Eldred  Corrigan    that was given  a hill for fighting  for the king . Get your story  straight  or I will

So sad.
To me    and  my family which is yours
U should say sorry
That statement must have been so difficult to the family...and rightly so  So....bring it on laddie!
I live across the ocean 🌊 in the USA 🇺🇸 and I have to say that I was deeply moved by this! Very heartfelt indeed!🥺❤️
No matter how old you are when you lose a parent you revert to your childhood for a period. So hard.
❤️
From America, my most heartfelt condolences. 🙏🏼 💔 🇬🇧
Bless his heart. This had to have been hard for him to come out and speak without getting emotional. Prince Charles has always been a dapper gent! Always gracious. 👌🏻🥺Tis a somber day for England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😞
Tje wheels of time and seasons are passing by and turning,the old powers are coming to an end,the time is right the time is at hand,bye bye Goddamn dinasours,your reigns are alomost over.
Well done Prince Charles.Thankyou for your time.
Condolence from the Philippines.🇵🇭♥️🇬🇧
The future King is a gracious and sensitive man.  My deepest sympathies to you now, Prince Charles.
Be kind to yourselves at this difficult time. Prince Philip was a very special person! Rest In Peace.
Take care Prince Charles and family.
God bless you, Prince Charles
Wow, Charles took the time to come out and acknowledge to so many people during this difficult time of the passing of his papa. Prayers to the Queen and the royal family. R.I.P. Prince Phillip Duke of Edinburgh.
Sometimes, it's harder to lose someone with whom we have cherished for so long.  My heart goes out to the Queen. God Bless Her, and all the Family.  Harry, I'm glad you're coming home. I'll leave that there.
I am in another country now but still identify myself as British. Know that I send the family my condolences. Prince Philip was such a stalwart person beside the Queen. Rest in Peace, sir.
Very graceful Charles...
Is Me_again attending to the funeral ?
He's too old to call father
The nices vidéo of Father and Son I have ever seen.
I cried 😭
PRINCE CHARLES YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE SON HAVING A VERY WONDERFUL FATHER PRINCE PHILIP SO GOOD AND EVERYTHING IN HIM SO FAITHFUL TO YOUR QUEEN MOTHER ELIZABETH.  *A MODEL PRINCE FAITHFUL PRINCE PHILIP *
the duke of edinburgh had a great sense of black humor and if he was an excellent person for uk
Strange way to thank people, as if we were the mailman or the milkman. Or a delivery service.
Bless. My deepest condolency
He couldn't  stand his father no love loss here! The party starts at 9 sharp . We will party like its 1999 ( 2099)
Well said Charles 🥰 Love and prayers to your family from Canada 🇨🇦 ❤️🙏
I felt this immense sadness when I heard the news. Prince Philip is such an inspiration for all of us. He was supporting the Queen while helping charities that really close to his heart and passion. The strongest and one of the most hardworking royals in the history. I’m genuinely worried for Queen Elizabeth. I can’t imagine the pain she’s feeling right now. I hope her family will never leave her side during this time.
So sad x
Dear  Prince Charles. If your beloved Father Prince Phillip is gone We' ll stand for him beside you.🐿️ The Dodges.💕  E.A.C. 👀

I rejoyce for Phillip as he has moved on to the ultimate Paradise but I feel sorrow for the ones left behind  Phillip is at peace now. and  the ones he left behind are in my thoughts and prayers
My condolences
I just want to go and put my arms around the Queen and tell her GOD LOVES YOU. A fantasy, I know, but, thank you, Sir, for your years of patriotic service. I liked that you were so straightforward. Good for you! Your Majesty, your love shone through everything you two did together, and ... when you meet again, in GOD's Mansion set aside for you, will do again.
God bless your family 👪 in your time of sorrow. Sending love from America!!! I will keep you in my prayers.
Papa
Your father was so admired by so many. My deepest sympathy to you and your family.
So sad that they have to appear Infront of the cameras during this time.
He is annoying 😖
Bless you and your family 🙌
Much has been made of the, alleged, strained relationship Charles and his father had down the years, how he never really forgave the Duke for insisting he attend Gordonstoun school which he is said to have loathed. Well watching the prince here giving the brief yet sincere heartfelt tribute to his 'dear Papa' I think it is safe to say that Charles did indeed deeply love and respect his father, the pain is clearly etched on his face. Condolences, Sir, to you, your mother the Queen and the family. R.I.P. HRH, The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
Im so sorry for your loss.. he was an amazing man 🥰
So sorry for your loss PC... may your father R.I.P....
A lifetime together. God bless the Queen. A beautiful and gracious woman. He leaves a strong and touching legacy.
He sounds totally different when he speaks now than he did years ago ! RIP Prince Philip 🙏🏻
Well done Charles. My heart aches for the Queen.
Prayers for the family
I feel sad for Prince Charles and the Queen along with the rest of the family, as for Harry and Meagan I feel nothing for them. Rest in Peace Prince Phillip. Thank you for your Service and Devotion to Queen and Country.
Rest in Peace Prince Philip
My condolences to the queen and all her family rest in peace Phillip, thank you for your service.❤️

My heart aches so much for The Queen, the Royal Family, the Britain and the Commonwealth citizens.
My prayers are with you and your family God bless you all your Papa is always with you and now you all have a special angle watching over you all. God bless from the Testa family from New Jersey 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
My father passed away in January this year. It takes a long while to recover from such an experience but it is very enriching. Best wishes to Prince Charles! By the by thank you all for all the likes!
I knew pp was terminal when charles came from the hospital crying. Haz had plenty of time to go home and make his peace with pp.   But arrogant, nasty, entitled man boy that he is forfeited that time.   Don't  cry now.
We only understand the beautiful words of the beautiful Prince Charles. His and many others "PAPA's" art unto their offspring, "VERY SPECIAL PERSONS" ... even many decades later.
Mal portadoesposo
My condolences to the Queen and the  Royal family.  God bless the queeen.
Thank you Prince Charles.  My condolences.
His papa was da 🐐
So sad, and for Prince of Wales to have to mention the commonwealth speaks volumes,  that MM IS ONE NASTY soul
Rest in Peace, Prince Philip from the United States. Condolences to the Queen and his family.
It’s strange to me to see an old man and his older father. Not something we’re used to seeing. Everyone loves well beyond into their older years in that family.

My sincere condolences to Queen Elizabeth and her family on the loss of Prince Philip. His steadfast loyalty to his family has been truly admirable. He was a beacon of selfless devotion to his family and the world. May he rest in peace.
Sad
You guys are completely confused!! next thing you’ll say rip Jimmy Saville
REST IN PEACE PRINCE PHILLIP, you have finished your course and kept the faith. God bless!!
Commiserations to you sir.
😥
Losing a parent is never easy; even when you aware the time is near. Sending sincerest condolences to the Royal Family.
Prince Charles-I offer my deepest condolences to you, Her Majesty, the Queen, and the rest of the Royal Family. All of you are in my prayers.
I lost my father when I was 25. It felt like I had lost out on so many years with him. But looking at Charles I can also see the other side of it- to have lived so long with both your parents is definitely a blessing, but it must be just shattering to lose one at that point. They've been there for so incredibly long, it must rock your whole sense of the world and yourself.
All my sympathies and condolences to the royal family. His Royal Highness will be sadly missed all over the world. Greetings from Germany and God bless!
Much love and respect from Australia 🇦🇺❤️
Poor Charles. He an alright chap.
So dear. God bless you all.
“My Dear Papa...”, is all I’m going to say.
Toda una vida con el príncipe Felipe, por ello el duelo es más doloroso sobre todo para la reina Isabel quien estuvo casada con él muchos años, Dios les de el consuelo que necesitan en estos momentos dolorosos 🙏
Yes, we all know that you are all Germans!

Prince Philip was ace - an absolute legend. He will be missed. Poor Queenie...
My deepest condolences and prayers 💐
I'm thinking of you all at this time. May God be with you, and all his comfort. ❤🌹
No matter what our parents represent to us or what kind of a relationship we had,  when they are gone you miss them.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
may he rest in peace our thought and prayers are with the queen and her family
Deepest condolences 💐
Lovely tribute to his Dad🙏 The loss of parents are devastating at any age🥺 My Deepest Condolences to The Royal Family. 🙏May his soul rest in peace 🙏😔
Now Philip will be able to rub shoulders with Charles best mate Jimmy Savile.
Descansa en paz elegante caballero que brille para el la luz  perpetua.
My condolences to you and your family, Prince Charles. I love your family
To the entire family: I am so sorry to hear you have lost the patriot of your family. I love the way he loved each of you but especially his precious Queen. My prayers are with you all.
God bless prince Phillip I am sure all of the family  miss him,rip.
73 years of married life, remarkable . Thank you for your service Prince Philip. R I P
I think these men of that era who fought in WWII were such special men. They truly valued life and having a family and a home. So many of them died during that conflict and they saw horrors that they never talked about but it affected them their whole life. He definitely supported and valued the country that gave him a home after he lost his. He very much loved and supported his wife and children, he was always there for them, that’s the exact way my father who also was a Navy veteran was, he was the most loving and dependable man always taking care of his wife and children. My dad fought at the Battle of Midway and according to what I’ve read that was pretty bad but he never talked about how scared he was but he did thank God for bringing him home. I never knew of any of the men who served during that terrible time who didn’t stay married and supportive and happy to just have a home filled with family. I think they truly appreciated what they had or what they could have lost. Your Queen will suffer his loss now everyday for the rest of her life. I hope she will be okay and not decline in health herself after this devastating loss for her. She has known him such a long time. She is surrounded by people but she will be lonely now.
R.I.P. Prince Philip God Bless and Guide the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family through this heartache 💔💔💔
My condolences to you all. Prince Philip was a good man
❤️❤️🙏🙏
My Father passed 16 years ago, I still instantly emotionally come apart at the thought of such.  My condolences.
My dear papa😪
So many around the world mourn the loss of Prince Philip. How considerate of Prince Charles to take the time to speak to us about his feelings at such a very sad time. Our thoughts are with the Queen and all her family.
❤🙏
Charles, my deepest sympathies to you, your mother your Majesty Queen Elizabeth and to the rest of your family.
Sending my sorrow for our nations loss and the royal family's  loss of a very, very special beloved family member. I fear that an important British era is slowly coming to an end.😔🙁

God bless you and your family during this time.
he was very fortunate to have a dad that long and still got him mum, very very lucky really
Outside of politics, Prince Philip was still a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. The private man we'll never know like they do, good or bad. They still lost someone in their family on a world stage. Hugs.
May he Rest in Peace

Podre padre viejo ke ya no hay tuvo un hijo parásito y ke hizo mucho daño
It is never easy for anyone at any age to have lost your father/ parent and the weeks and months ahead will be difficult for all the Royal  family and especially HM The Queen. Like all families they will need time to grieve. I pray for them all. Prince Philip will sleep in peace.
Rest in Peace Prince Phillip. We all respect you immensely  and your contributions to United Kingdom, Queen and Commonwealth. RIP.
May your father rest in peace. So sorry for you and your families loss

Very sad x
RIP Prince Philip
Prince Charles, always the gentleman.  I would like to share in your heartfelt emotions in this time of sorrow.
As Prince Charles was stepping back into the doorway I couldn't help but notice how much he resembles his father.
if only you people knew whats really going on
We send love to the Queen frome the vikings in Vestfjord Iceland ❤
Yeah, Charles, he's Saint Phillip now. Tell us what you called him when you were whining to your grandmother, the late Queen Mother, about having to go to Gordonstoun where you were being physically and emotionally abused, sent there by a father who was jealous of your rank and feared your royal status' eclipsing him, while your mother did NOTHING to stand up to him, fearing he would publicly humiliate her by leading a separate life.
Condolences 🥺🥺🌹🌹
Thank you for what you have done for us, a country of commonwealth. You came 4 times to visit us. You have contributed enormously to our education and medical system.
That was so touching.
Beautiful words I cant say any more I'm so cut up by what has happened and the fact we will never see Prince Phillip again or hear him and his funny comments all I know I will miss him greatly God Bless Sir RIP
My condolences to the Royal family.
I can see the sadness and hurt on his face. My condolences to the royal family at this time.

I think the Queen will step down very  soon
God Bless the Queen. Prince Philip will be so missed. Condolences to the Royal Family and to the United Kingdom 🇬🇧.
My condolences prince charles.
They call this service...upstairs downstairs anyone?
A very genuine speech, completely without fanfare.  Charles has led by example here at least. Hopefully Harry will take the opportunity to reconcile with his family this week.
My sincerest condolences to the royal family. Sending all of you loving thoughts and prayers from NY! God bless!
Condolences from Spain 🇬🇧❤️🇪🇸

Yes Prince Charles your father going to be greatly miss
Our deepest condolences to the royal family.
This is the most i've heard him speak. After watching the satyrical show "The Windsors", the actor who portrays him actually nailed his voice and pronunciation.
Long Live The Queen 👑 Blessings to the Queen and all the family💕👑 Can't imagine the pain of losing your husband after so many year's. I saw that she fell for him at age 13. True Love is rare.💕 USA 🇺🇸 Tennessee 🇺🇸
This doesn't feel like an apt response. Way too fabricated.
Racist.
Rest in peace . Our thoughts are with you all.x

RIP our Prince Philip 🤴 😢 you will be miss.
"My dear Papa" 😭😭😭 Prince Philip will be so missed by everyone and no one will ever forget him! May he rest in peace 🙏🏻💔💔💔💔
RIP Prince Phillip Duke of Edinburg  Condolences to Mrs. Elizabeth 🌞 My Queen of my other land. I hope you all find peace in a difficult situation and no matter the family issue, hold each other. This is the greatest example of never putting things off for tomorrow which could be done today. I’m still on the fence with the Harry Megan disaster but regrettably for Harry that was a year of times he could have spent with his grand da and his son, a year of hugs, tea, and yard games instead of allowing someone who is obviously a liar, (girl u didn’t just learn yesterday who Harry was or his family) no one cares how popular she is in America which isn’t that big until she started dating him. How can u feel like a respectable woman to put that type of pressure on Harry to change the way his family thinks, this is 100s of years of behavior and she has no right, she could never stand up to the standard of the Queen. She has been the role model for people for a hundred years, she gave up every comfort of a common woman to take the throne and make her country, her father, family before and after her, most of all her grandchildren. My mom use to say Queen Elizabeth should have handled Diana’s death differently but later told me the Queen needed that time of silence to protect her grandsons from what was to come and I respect that. Megan could never measure up and had no right to obligate anyone to change for her comfort. Harry should have stood up but instead he coward and missed that beautiful time he could have spent with this amazing hero who helped raise him. Sorry I ranted a bit.  RIP Sweet Phillip God save the Queen
Prince Philip left an amazing and distinguished legacy. May his memory be a blessing. 🙏🏼
D.E. P.
May God receive the Prince's soul in His Eternal Glory.  🙏
We love you, and we will miss Prince Philip.
Special lizard, coming back as a virus,but we are prepared!
Pice for him
Yes, remarkable in every way. I salute Prince Phillip in admiration. I am so proud that we have been outstandingly represented for so long by Her Majesty the Queen and Prince Phillip and the words of gratitude are echoed  around the World. May strength and peace be with you all.
Your majesty mr.Prince Charles and your mother The Queen of England Elizabeth II wish you to be alive and health and to live to a 100 years like your fahter prince Phillip.Accept my condolences!
I have to wonder, did Prince Philip have racist views towards Black people and other minorities???

He looks terrible
Canada mourns the loss of His Royal Highness Prince Philip. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Queen and with the members of our Royal Family, whom, as Canadians, make us proud beyond what words can describe. God Save The Queen of Canada, long may she reign!
I saw Prince Philip and the Queen when I was quite young. they were on a train travelling thru the city I lived in Brantford ontario and my Grandfather took my brothers and I to watch the train to catch a glimps of the royal couple. the train was travelling past us and when the rear car of the train passed the Prince and the queen were standing on the back of the train and my Grandfather yelled out Philip and the prince turned and look a bit bewildered and saw us beside the tracks and said "oh hello there" and smiled and waved at us like we were old friends. I think that made my grandfathers day when that happened and I can still remember the smile on both my grandfathers and the prince's face.
May your dad rest in piece. Miss you Queen DIANA
My deepest condolences to the Royal family.

Hipócrita.
Why would anybody give this a thumbs down?
Dear Prince Charles, I am so sorry about your tremendous lost . Your father was a great man and well respected throughout the world. He left the world behind as a better place. To me personally, he was an idol as a father, husband and man. I had so much respect for him for the person he was. He will live on in our hearts. My deepest sympathy to the royal family.
Our thoughts and prayers with the Queen and yours family at this sad time. Amazing life journey. Rest in Peace Prince Philip🙏

CONDOLENCES PRINCE CHARLES 🇬🇧 🇮🇹 .  MARK ITALY 11/04/2021
Excellent speech
Great speech future King Charles.
so was my dad and my grandad,
My deepest condolences to all the Royal Family 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
For God's sake man talk normal English and take that left hand out your pocket.
No matter what, he still, and all his siblings, have lost their father to death. Your dad or papa is still your father. My sympathies to them. 💕
Thank you, Sir, and thank you, Sir.
I know why but I don’t like how they say “The Queen” in place of my mum or my mommy or my grandmother. Like “he was a great support for so many years to “the Queen” instead of saying my papa was a great loving support to my mum the Queen for many years, you know? I mean I see why but I think it’s just because no matter how my English family taught us our whole lives to not be to emotionally especially in public and loud American overly emotional outbursts are tacky, I’ve always been that one to be reserved but never dismiss emotions of those around me.
Just sick and tired of the amount time ALL the media is spending on this. Thought the saturation coverage of Coronavirus was bad enough but this story has absolutely no bearing or meaning for the ordinary person so why rip apart TV and radio schedules for a bloke who had no influence on the running of the country.  The only people interested are the royal snobs!
I love how you can hear the door lock behind him.
yes he was a well loved figure who shall indeed be missed.
Prayers Are Sent For The Royal Family. She 🙏❤🙏
Much prayers to the whole Royal Family, especially all the children that will miss him so much. I will miss his wicked dry sense of humor and the look of love on his face when he looked at his family, especially Queen Elizabeth...after 73 years he was still very deeply in love with his wife. We could all hope to be so loved in life as Philip loved Elizabeth.
Rest in Peace  His Royal Highness may his family sought solace and comfort in this very sad time. Thinking of you Your Highness Prince Charles I lost my father in 2019 so I feel your sorrow.
I loved hearing "my dear papa"
My parents were married over 60 years and my mother was never the same after my dad passed away in 2017. She's with him now though. She joined him last August, but she was never the same person. Very sad. RIP Prince Philip.⚘🇺🇸

Sending condolences 😢💔💕💕🙏🙏
Condolences to Prince Charles in the loss of his Papa, and to the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family.  Prince Philip was a shining example who showed that a man can stand behind/beside and support his Queen.  He was the Wind Beneath her Wings, in love for over 70 plus years (marriage goals for many of us), and duty to his country and the world.  May he Rest in Peace.
Prince Charles looks broken - I'm so sorry for yours and your families loss ❤️
Sympathies from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Doesn't matter what position you hold, doesn't matter how old you are. Lost of loved ones is not easy, specially your dad.  I feel sorry for the Queen, prince Charles and royal family. Please accept my sincere condolences for this loss.
I am so very sorry for your loss.  He was a treasure. Having grown up in a military family, I know how direct they can he, which is one thing I really saw in your papa.  My thoughts are prayers are with the Queen and your entire family.  I can't begin to think how hard it would be to deal with losing your husband of 73 years.  Your father was a treasure for all of you and for your nation.  May he rest in peace.  Memory Eternal.
Sir, my sincere condolences to the Queen, you and your family. May Prince Philip Rest In Peace.

God bless this family as you have received Prince Philip into your kingdom.
Really sorry for your loss.
Hear!  Hear!
Very difficult times for The Queen and the whole Royal Family. Prince Philip was a husband, father, grandfather etc...more than a Duke. Seeing them as humans overwhelms us because we are used to see them as untouchable...at the end we are all the same. RIP Prince Phillip 🙏🏻
Very sorry for your loss.
Well said Prince Charles  will the queen be speaking  on behalf of her husband   I  m so sorry for her loss  rest peacefully    prince Phillip 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
From Michigan U.S.A.- Thank you, Prince Charles!  My heart goes out to you and the family as well as your Country!  I was heartened to learn of your Father’s shared interest with you in ecology and preserving nature!
Prince Charles the Queen and the royal family have my deepest condolences. Prince Philip will be greatly missed by everyone he was a truly great man. And above all else a great husband and father.
Só  Deus  nós dar  forças. Sentimentos  fraterno pra toda família.
How stoggy....speaks too the political aspect and smiles at the end....rumour, this was not a good relationship
The world will forever change without your beautiful papa . What a. Sweet charming man he was . Sending my prayers for your whole family & Much Love ❤️💕🌹
Lovely to have a member of the royal family say these words at this time.To say Prince Phillip was so widely criticised during his life it is wonderful to see how much he is loved by people. Rest in peace Sir,you worked hard.x
I am sorry for your loss! I'll remember you all in my prayers!
They never got on. BS
We never appreciated Prince Philip anywhere near enough.  So strange how we never choose to listen to the men who have fought for conservation for decades, men such as Princes Philip and Charles and Sir David Attenborough, but, the world reveres a teenage girl who does nothing, but, demand attention for herself by pretending to care about the environment and having meltdowns about her childhood being ruined while we learn about the childhood of Prince Philip and how it shaped him. Perhaps we should force children to deal with life the way Philip had to instead of wrapping them up in cotton wool and raising thin skinned anxiety ridden young adults.
Deepest condolences
My deepest condolences to Prince Charles and his family.
These were beautifully said words. Prince Charles has uttered them with such feeling and understanding of the Prince Philip. Prince Charles's words were very touching as such as I don't know him. Thank you. It is so kind for him to step in for his mom and speak for the whole family what is so difficult to articulate in the time of such sorrow.
I can only imagine how difficult it was to even share these words. RIP Prince Phillip 🙏
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭         More sad than when I heard they were cancelling Friends  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

He had a great sense of humor & will be missed!
Such a sweet and gentle tribute from Prince Charles, thank you.  Huge thanks to Prince Philip for your life and dedication to the Queen, your Family,  your Country and Commonwealth. Three cheers for a brave and wonderful man.
Not me I could care less about your family. #TIME FOR UOI PEOPLE NOW TO LET MY COUNTRY GO
Build back better ✊🏻
To here Prince Charles refer to his father as Papa was heart warming.  He , the Royal family , in particular Queen Elizabeth, and the English people and all Common Wealth people have my deepest sympathy. Although I am an American I have always admired all of them. RIP Prince Philip.
I feel so sorry that Prince Philip had to endure this circus with his grandson and that gold digger wife in his last months of life. He did not deserve that especially after a lifetime of service for this country.  May he rest in peace. Deepest condolences from Germany.
Dear Prince Charles  Thinking of you in this sad times. May your Papa rest in Peace.🙏💛
My dad was also also a very special person , worked hard all his life served in the war and worked until he was 65 retired with little money and died soon after , that is what I call a hard life, scratching. Around for a living,
❤
beautiful....ty...
My deepest condolences. We will never understand what it takes to be part of the royal family, yes they are privaliged and will never understand what it's like to be working class, but they are held dear to our hearts and make our country unique. The Queen is remarkable and hopefully will take a back seat soon, she has done far more than ever expected. GSTQ 🇬🇧
I am very sorry for your loss, Your Royal Highness. I lost my father last summer, I know your feelings. Please be strong and give support to your family. God be with you. With love from Russia.
He was 99 he dyed on the 9.  Snitch is the 99.day of the year mm is this interresting
He's with his Mama now, he lost her for many years as a child and he choose never to complain.  He made the best of the life he had. RIP.
Sending prayers to lift up the Royal Family♡♢☆♡☆♢♡ RIP Prince Phillip♡☆♢♡
He seems happy.
Yes Prince Charles your loss is very painful as Son to have lost his father for the grief of your mother and the loss to the United Kingdom as a wonderful man
Greetings from the Czech Republic. You have my deepest condolences, I learned about it yesterday. I'm very sorry .. 😔😢
😭😭😭
Condolences to the entire family, especially the Queen
I’m glad Prince Charles came out and said these words. I’m sure he had a challenging relationship with his father and I think as he matured, they had similar interests on big matters of this planet. When you’re a sensitive being it’s hard to have a tough father and it must be hard to continually be in the public spotlight and have your life played out on such a huge platform with huge expectations on your shoulders you were born into. Good job Prince Charles. You’ve had a privileged life but it hasn’t been easy. 🤗🥰
Your father is dead all reddy for a year ore so isn’t he?
👍🇬🇧🙏
the crown must always wins!
There is only one thing that we can say at this particularly sad moment: Long live the Queen!
A wonderful man. A huge loss for the nation and for the family. Sending love and prayers 💜🌷
Broke my heart when he said my dear Papa☹️😢
I don't presume to know what it is like to lose someone at an early age. I do however know what it is like to lose a parent when one is older. It must be different. To have had someone so dear in one's life for so long and to be at an age where the loss is felt more severely, is difficult. My Mother passed in 2019 when I was 39. Our birthdays are consecutively. She on the 25th and I on the 26th of January. My deepest condolences to you, Prince Charles, to your family and to your dear Mama, Queen Elizabeth. Grief is the dearest price to pay for the greatest gift on Earth. Love. Rest in Peace Prince Philip.
If were lucky Prince William Will be the next king 🙏🏼 rip Prince Philip and god bless the Queen
My deepest condolences and prayers for Her Majesty the Queen and the entire Family, during this time. 🙏 ❤
One of the most evil families to walk the earth. Hopefully you follow suit soon!
May the LORD BE WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY PRINCE CHARLES.
My most heartfelt condolences to all members of the Royal Family and especially to Her Majesty the Queen. Prince Philip was much loved and respected by everyone and I'd like to extend my sympathies from the small village of Grondola in northern Tuscany.We are very proud of the close bond we retain with Great Britain and the Commonwealth.
wow funny his dad treat he in a way that's considered bad parenting but still he loved him as father and son
Prince Charles 's father gave a good  example  to be a father!
Sending your family lots of love ❤️

Can you change the royal advisors
It takes strength to hold it together with emotions and memories running riot. Sincerest condolences.
Bless him. Imagine having to have to make a speech about your beloved dad's passing only the day after. Having loss 2 aunts and my grandma in the last year I don't think I could bring myself to. May God bring comfort yo their whole family.
💐
My deepest thoughts go with the royal family x
RIP 🙏 Prince Philly.
I saw a documentary last night about the Duke and I noticed the little mannerisms he showed that Charles does too, it was cute.  Sending thoughts and prayers to the family in this difficult time, kia kaha arohanui 💚☮
So many royal boot lickers in the comments 😂😂😂😂
Papa is what Germans call their daddys, just saying....
You can see the pain in his face. It breaks my heart when people lose their loved ones 😭. My condolences
God bless you all x
No emotions and that's how he was raised to be...
General question what did he do ??
"Most Respectable Prince Charles ,very shocking news the death of  honour able Prince Philips ,this moment condolences to Royal family of United Kingdom ,God bless you all Royal family at this moment  " .
Indeed we share sorrow for the passing of your father.
Charles is a lovely character but I fear he is too soft to be king. I hope the batten gets passed to Wills when the time comes. He has serious grit.
My condolences and prayers are with you all
My condolences to the Royal family.
Dear Prince Charles. So sorry for your loss of your dear dad. Her majesty the Queen must be so sad too and the rest of the family. Your country and countries like my country which is a part of the commonwealth are sending love, comfort , and prayers fir you all 🙏🏽🙏🏽💕
Deepest condolences to the Royal Family.🌷🌷🌷
R.I.P, 💐 Dear Prince Philip. My condolences goes to the Family and friends. 🏅 God bless his soul 🕊️

Condoleances. Long live the monarchy. I love the pagentry and the culture. It represents the past present and the future. Hold on to it. Many African countries still have chieftoncy. A nation,  a culture needs symbolic references and refined rituals  that connect the past with the future. Rooted.
Prince Philip was a great man. May God rest his soul. I offer my deepest condolences to the Royal family and especially the Queen
wipe that smirk off your face.
May my king rest in peace
Lovely speech from the eldest son, rehearsed  and factual but lacking some emotion me thinks. I have read somewhere their relationship was strained at times.   We still don't know how he passed? Why is that a secret? I just wonder what vaccination he took?
God be with the RF long live the Queen
RIP Prince Phillip. I know the Queen is probably feeling like the other half of her soul is gone. We lost my father last year and my mother is still grieving terribly.
"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first Commandment with promise;) That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth." Ephesians 6 KJB
My deepest condolences to the British Royal Family....
Sincere condolences. Hope you and particularly the Queen are  coping ok.
Condolences to the family.Very sad indeed.
Is it weird I hear Josh O'Connor as he is speaking ? Josh really nailed the dialogue delivery wow ❤️
Toutes mes condoléances votre majesté.
Prince Philip was an outstanding man. My sincere condolences to the Queen and the Royal Family.

God save The Queen
I really felt for Prince Charles. Obviously as the senior male Royal, he was sent to do this oration. He has just lost his Father and Her Majesty has lost her husband....I hope they all get through the coming days with resolve and fortitude, knowing that the thoughts and prayers of the UK and Commonwealth are with them....😕
My sincere condolences to you Prince Charles and your family
Rest in peace Prince Philip, in a new Kingdom where God is the King.
🎉🤘🏻🤨
May the Lord bless you and give you peace 🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️
He seems very heavy hearted...it's sad to see. Losing a loved one is always hard. For the queen to have lost the only person she could be normal around is sad.
God Bless your mother the Queen. Prayers for her.
Meus sentimentos principe charles.e a  toda sua familia.

Our deepest condolences to the Royal Family. HRH Prince Philip is an admirable and loving person. Our heart goes out to the Queen . Thank you Prince Charles for sharing yourself to us in this very difficult time.
My heart goes out to HM The Queen, HRH Prince Charles and the rest of Royal Family at these sad times. The loss of HRH Prince Philip touches not just the Royal Family and the people of United Kingdom but the hearts of all people around the world. He was great man who will never be forgotten. Rest In Peace our beloved Prince Philip.
Prince Philip; great guy, never afraid to speak his mind, gave our fantastic queen support and strength, will be sadly missed.  RIP.
Yes good and well sorry but hes with the the princess Diana shes welcomed him home there both in peace now his service is done he s done a remarkable job God needed him now
I loved Prince Philip's dry sense of humour! He was far from perfect but he's a big part of history gone by all so quickly! I pray H.R.H finds great comfort in her faith, family and public right now!❤
It is always heart breaking, no matter the age, to lose your father.  I am so sad for you.  My condolences to the Queen and the Royal Family.  You could see in Prince Philip's face the love he had for the Queen, his children and Grand Children.  I know those pictures will sustain your memories for generations and hopefully ease your sorrow.  Prayers for you all.
"My dear papa", how very touching... RIP your Highness Prince Phillip; you were wonderful! 😥🙏🌹
To all the people expressing these sickly comments, just show some respect, whether this is a Royal family or not, it is a family who has suffered a loss... If you don't grieve with them, at least keep it silent. Not all of us were lucky enough to have had a parent who reached this old age.
Ein guter lieber Sohn ist der Kronprinz Charles.
They hate you, u are paying 4 their lifestyles and they never get cancer. U noticed that. Everyone gets cancer right? But these people always live to 100. They getting drugs we have never heard of b4.
Rest in peace dear Sir. 🙏💐
Next episode of the crown:  Plot twist: Elizabeth ordered Phil to die to gain sympathy from the world as they try to salvage what’s left of their image, in the midst of scandal initiated by Harry and Meghan.
Dear Prince Charles,  Last night, I was filled with such emotion and empathy, over the death of your father, Prince Phillip, and I typed this comment letter, and I was going to post it, but I didn't want to sound like a nut, but this morning, when I saw your heart-felt speech here, in this video, I wanted to share this with you, what I had wanted to post last night. (the day of Prince Phillip's passing)   I was supposed to be addressing Prince Phillip in this comment, as paying my respects.     Dear Prince Phillip,  We miss you already!  It somehow feels like you're still here among us, dear Prince Phillip.  Your personality is winning, and your presence like a smile to society.  I can still sense the friendliness, and warmth, even now.  Your steady character lives on.  I believe that you were an asset to the Monarchy.  And you accomplished alot in this life, plenty enough to make everybody proud of you, and to remember you fondly.  Thank you for all of your years of service, to your community, and complete devotion to your Queen, and lovely wife Elizabeth.     *****Prince Charles, again, I say, I was filled with emotion last night, and so I had wrote, (typed), exactly what I was feeling at that moment, last night.  I honestly felt like Prince Phillip wasn't gone yet, and I've been psychicly sensitive since I was a child.  I felt that Phillip's presence was around, especially his family, and that he was doing fine, and had transitioned into being passed, with ease, and that he was comfortable, and I got the feeling that he was a young man again, strong and virile.   Yes, strong in a masculine, gentlemanly way, probably similiar to how he was in the early years of his friendship/relationship, with the young Elizabeth.   And I could also sense that he doesn't want anybody to worry or make a fuss, that he's okay, he wanted to convey this.  (Ofcourse, he didn't say these things, but I could sense from afar).   I have been writing letters since I was 15 yrs.old, and I'm going to be 55, in May.  I first discovered my love for writing during the summer of 1981, when I was attending summer school, and our teacher was teaching us about the basic principals, of how to properly compose a letter.  (And it was in that same summer school class, that our teacher rolled a TV into the room, for us all to watch The Royal Wedding, of Prince Charles & Lady Diana Spencer, at the very moment that it was LIVE on the news)!!!   Well, I had discovered how much I enjoyed letter writing back then, and that maybe even I might have a gift for it?  My daughter is also an avid writer, I think she's probably better at it than I am!!  Lol.  She is 23 yrs.old now, and when she was in the 8th grade, she took a journalism class, and her journalism teacher recommended her to be a writer for the junior high school newspaper!!    And to read her articles that she submitted into the newsletter paper, you would think a professional had done it!!  (my parental pride)🤗     Queen Elizabeth, and you Prince Charles, and your whole family, are definately in my prayers.  And you are right dear Charles, we all loved and respected Prince Phillip, from people around the world.   Maybe during the grieving and mourning process, of Prince Phillip's passing, there could also be a celebration for his life, and what a great man he was, and that he's at peace, and content.
M
Condolences from America to the Royal Family, to the British people and to the people of the Commonwealth around the world.
When Prince Charles becomes King the UK will be in safe hand and when Prince William becomes king the UK will be in safe hands. The Commonwealth will continue to be a force for good.
A sad day! The loss of HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, has touched the hearts of many. May his soul rest in peace.
May he rest in peace Amen. His devotion to his wife should be an example to all couples around the world - husbands and wives support each other!
Is it me or did he just come out say a few words and disappear back inside the building like Willie Wonka
God bless the royal family
Actually he was not a good person
RIP and condolences to the royal family. I sincerely hope you get the opportunity to talk sense into Harry while he’s in England without his narcissistic wife.
We love your dear father, Prince Charles, and God bless you for your kind thoughtfulness in speaking today. You and the royal family are very much loved. God bless the Queen. RIP HRH Prince Philip✨🌟💜🙏🏻💜🌟✨
💐we share your loss sincerely
Yes so do most people when parents die.but he lived a life most can only dream of living..and at 99 is a good age..

I didnt realise how much he done for our country,seemed very down to earth
Kc
Something about the look on Prince Charles' face breaks my heart.
R.I.P Prince Philip. You were a decent figure next to the Queen. I recently found out you were Greek too.So for me there is one more reason to feel proud of our nation.
Bless them all! May the Duke watch over the Queen & his family from above!🙏
this is prolly gonna be featured in the crown
👹
Sending my condolence to you Prince Charles and your siblings
💛
R.I.P prince Philip. You gave strength and hope to us all.  Being an English citizen is a dream because of you and the royal family. Thankyou for your service.
Broken my heart " my papa"♥️...blessings to the family and country
Just the body language alone in this shows the deeply personal human affect this has on anybody, regardless of ones status, be it Prince or pauper.
amazing how he only lost his dad after having grey hair himself and still has his mom around. lucky bloke.meghan you cannot hope to hog the spotlight.. first prince philips death, then someday (hopefully not soon) the queen's right after which prince william's ascension, kate's upgraded title not to mention the 3 little darlings growing up one by one under the spotlight. meghan you cant hope to outdo any of the above processions and rites of passages unless you run for presidency at the right moment and win. still there is a lot stacked against you and you are nowhere near as likeable, charismatic or pedigreed as diana
The world just needs to leave them alone for a time so that they can all grieve. This should not be a spectacle. Time to say goodbye to a loved one is a long road to acceptance.💔❤❤

Despite your feelings for Charles, wether you like him or not. He’s still a grieving son who loved his father very much and is  mourning his papa.
HE GONN😭🤣🤣
So sad he lost his father, but how many of us can be 72 years old and still have not just one, but both of our parents? He’s very lucky.
So lucky to have his dad for so long. I lost my dad when I was 18. Sad days.
His Royal Legend The Prince Philip RIP old chap...
As your friend Rabbi Lord would have said may his memory be a blessing
sympathy and condolences to her Majesty the queen and the royal family... I love royal family so much... From Bangladesh
😢
A real Prince for his Queen.
I give my condolences for his death. I hope you will find happiness for a love lost.
Very comforting to hear words spoken by Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward.  My brother and I grew up with Charles & Anne (and later Andrew & Edward),  in Ottawa.  They were always part of our lives.   Whenever the Queen visited Ottawa, her motorcade passed by  our street, so the entire neighbourhood used to gather to wave them on.
Sending all our love and prayers to Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Family. Deepest and warmest condolences. May the Good Soul of Prince Philip rest in Peace in Heaven 💖🙏💜
My father was in the US Army, stationed in London when the queen was coronated. He would tell me stories of the war and of England. I was always fascinated, and have followed the monarchy for most of my life. I feel like I lost a family member. RIP Prince Philip. Condolences to the royal family and their friends.
My condolences to the whole Royal Family. I wish I could have met him.I am able to follow the Royal family  thru media .I have been watching all his past endeavors and I feel that he was an amazing man. A man whose life encompassed more than just being a supportive, tolerant man but also a positive and active figure of the Royal family. He and The Royal family will always have my highest respect and admiration. His life represents an important moment in history and time. May God always continue to bless you and thank you for providing a window to your lives,and your beautiful family. Showing  us that even through all your trials and tribulations you have been able to display and set an example of how to carry on. A big salute  from my family to yours Rest in peace Prince Philip.  From Maywood  Illinois U.S.A.,Jacqueline Ruiz.
So  So Sorry for your  Heartbreaking Lost of your Papa. I know I lost my Daddy also years ago. 💛💙💚💜✝️
That was a lovely tribute ❤️ thank you 🙏🏻 rip Prince Philip ❤️
RIP LOVELY MAN X THINKING OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY AT THIS TIME X
He didn't need to make an appearance
God bless him
Témoignage filial émouvant. Le Prince Philip était notre Père ou Grand-père à tous. Qu.il dorme en paix
He was a fine man
Prince Charles does have deep sensitivity, and grieving whilst being there for his mother, so Harry should get cracking and be there for his father
RIP prince Phillip
This video broke me in tears 😭  Rest in peace Prince Phillip
Hes next.
Very touching and respectful and giving time to come out to address the nation on this most difficult of time.
Ein großer Mann mit Humor. Bleibt unvergessen.
God bless him
I’m crying. How sweet is Prince Charles.  Thank you🙏🏻💕 Much love to you and your family.
Papa, is a German expression for Daddy, very cute,and Papa comes from the Heart !!
The Queen must be feeling the biggest hole in her heart- over 70 years of having someone at her side, who understood her, and she in turn understood him. What a pair.  My deepest sympathy to her HRM.
Oh poor Prince Charles, he must be heartbroken.  I wish we could reach out and put our collective arms around him and help him in his deep sorrow.  We are all heartbroken for the loss of such a Great Man.  But he wasn’t our ‘dear Papa’. Although I think we all feel like we lost our Father or Grandfather.  He was Charles’s.   Thank you Prince Charles for taking the time to speak to us at this time.    Everyone is so deeply sad for his loss, and for your family.   We are sending you so much love and healing energy.  God Bless you and your family, we are flying our flags at half mast and we had a 41 gun salute to honour your wonderful father here in Australia.  Your family has all our love and prayers 🙏💖🙏🇬🇧🇦🇺
It is a very sad period for you Prince Charles. Sincere condolenses from Croatia. I hope Harry respects the moment.
My sincere condolences! Good bless the Royal Family 🇬🇧❤️🇧🇷
Thankyou Charles, we are all so moved by your words and I must say that although I never knew nor met your father, I am surprised at myself how moved and sad I am for all the family and in particular the Queen x he was such an example to us all for he gave so much both to his wife and family, to the U.K. and to the Commonwealth, the world will grieve at his passing, what a remarkable and outstanding man.
we are praying a special Prayer
C'est gentil prince ta tristesse peux se sentir n'est pas fasil c'est dure moment Dieu du ciel je vous acompagne dans votre douleur de tout mon cœur 💓❤️
Am very sorry for the sad loss of His Highness The Prince Phillip and condolences to Prince Charles and his family.
My ♥ is absolutely breaking 😢, he was and is a legend 🇬🇧 RIP sir
A monarchy nowadays stands for an other. Rip Prince Philip 🇲🇦🇬🇧
is he dead or just shedding skin
🇬🇧
lol
I pray comfort for the Royal Family in their grief. RIP Prince Philip.
Oh my dear Lord in heaven, what a heartfelt thank you to everyone around the globe from Prince Charles. The tears wear just streaming down my face. I to know what a loss like this does to your soul since I recently lost my Aunt, Dragons & Swans, who had made so many lovely friends on here,for which I am truly grateful. I lost both of my parents before the age of 5 , and My Aunt and Uncle took me in  as if I were their child. The loss of a parent or parental figure has left me feeling empty. Thank heavens I have memories and my Uncle, but his loss has been one of absolute devastation without her. I am in America and he is in England. I to missed the final moments with the only woman I remember as a mother. My Aunt didn't want a funeral either, but a small memorial service was alright with her. Yet it still doesn't seem right as I can't even do that for her yet, and she crossed on the 28th of March 2021 @0115 am UK time. May the holy spirit surround her Majesty and family with love,light,and compassion during this devastating time. Rest in peace HRH Prince Philip and God save the Queen.🇬🇧 👑🎩🌹🎖💜🎗💫🌅
Stay healthy, Prince Charles!
Deepest sympathy to Her Majesty the Queen and to her family. RIP Prince Philip 🙏🙏🌺
I lost my father 6 days ago. I can understand their sorrow for losing theirs. My condolences to the royal family, and RIP the Duke if Edinburg
Rest In Peace.
God save the Queen, bless the Royal Family. Condolences 🇨🇦❤🇬🇧
He’s in heaven  now and he’s not  a racist!. God’s bless the queen!
Shame poor Charles. He has lost a son,wife and now his Papa
Such a sad time for the Queen, Royal siblings and the rest of the family...My heart goes out to them all, i have felt deeply saddened over the loss of Prince Philip whom i always liked & respected and i will miss his great sense of humour that most people took in light hearted harmless way and others whom took it as  some crime of the century but then we will always have the ones that are so easily offended over everything & anything...  Rest in Peace Prince Philip and Thankyou for all you did and all you gave.  God Bless
My heart goes out to the  Queen, the family and Great Britain
Y nada que se le muere la mamá a ver si lo hacen rey 😂😂😂
I have not been a fan of Charles but my heart goes out to him and his family I just lost my dad on Easter and I’m devastated I know Charles is too

Rest easy sir
Rip prince Phillip miss you dearly
sincere condolences to the queen and all the royal family
😢😢😢😢🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Herzliches Beileid from the south of Germany where your father briefly went to school. It does not matter how young or old you are when a parent dies, it always hurts because that is the point when you are truly a child no more. He was a remarkable man, he overcame so many obstacles in his life, and it only ever made him stronger. I wish him fair winds and calm seas on his last voyage.
So sad. Such a great man.
😭🌱🌱🌱🌱
This is the place he bought to be near camiila
AHH god bless Prince Phillip... And so so sorry for your loss clarles!.. my grandad is 93... He hasn't seen anyone hardly in over a year due to covid... He's not eternal, and it's awful because I've just had a baby, his first great grandchild...  Only hope I can see him soon before nature takes it course, I think we can all relate. Love to ever
All he's thinking is, "when is my mother gonna die so I can finally be King???"
I feel for Prince Charles and his whole family.. This has got to be hard for his mom the Queen.. They were together for a long time and not having him beside her has got to be a hard.. I'm praying that she makes it through all of this.. May Prince Philip rest in peace.. 😥
If there is Something Like THE RING,  Like the GRAL. I would do all to save our beloved Queen. The world/earth without Queen Elizabeth will Change in circling. With Love to this Family from Germany
👏👏👏
🕊️🙏🙏🙏
RIP His Royal Highness “Prince Philip” Duke of Edinburgh. Thank you so much for your service both for the nation and for the public. Thank you for teaching every man of this generation how to be dutiful service man, a husband , a father , a grandfather , a great-grandfather.  Your legacy will live on for ever and ever.   Long Live Duke of Edinburgh legacy!   Heartfelt condolence to our royal family! ❤️🙏
To HRM, be strong, mama, it's happened but you need to be there to see to it that,  there are no more sweeping statements about royalty., and that through prince Philip's guidance   you will be able to steer the ship of great Britain ❤  Be well. 🙏✍  Arrange to induct people who have fallen short of understanding British  culture that tailors to royalty.  We are worried that the Prince Harry  is out of the palace. By all means, through his father, let him return home. He has not been married, but he's the one who married someone who should be in  the palace. That's how it is. , a bitter pill to swallow.
A Rasist man has died. Hate from lndia for Colonist.
Thank you for steeping out in this moments Prince Charles, we are with your family. Your privacy is most respected and well guarded, in hopes an Universal language our ancestors fought for love and freedom keeps spraying its joy from the beyonds. I love your papa, gentleman like and his jokes.
My condolences, hope your family find peace in this sad a time.
Such a sad time for The Queen and all the Family. May Prince Philip rest in Gods love Amen. Ireland.
Nothing sounds genuine about big ears comments, Philip was probably the best out of a pathetic bunch!
He served his country in the war and beyond he was a huge support to our queen and his family my deepest condolences to them al!
I will Miss you Prince Philip. You have always been around all my life. Prayers to the Queen and rest of Rotal Family.
The Duke touched so many lives.Loads of us from under privileged backgrounds benefited from his charity work
An amazing back story HRH King Phillip had and may he rest in blessed peace. He deserves heaven with the family crises he faced for sure. That's tough for anyone, no matter how much privilege they get. HRH Prince Charles is 'Man of the house' now. No pressure but that's how it is now. I liked this video yes!!!!👍😭+😅
Thank you Prince Charles for taking the time to speak to us. You're hurting and when you spoke of your dear Papa, the love was rich in your voice. God bless you and your family. Your wonderful mother and Queen is a special lady.
💖🙏💛
Oh look! The future tampon King who promotes the great reset with Klaus Schwab.
♥️♥️♥️👍♥️♥️
RIP great Philip
Love you Charles.  So sorry Megan and Harry have bee  so horrible to you   Shameless!
Love and prayers sent to the Queen and the family
🙏🏻
Une intervention courte mais sobre du Prince Charles d'Angleterre. Il a employé le mot "papa" et en cela cela résume tout ce qu'il était pour lui. Le Prince Philip était assurément quelqu'un de spécial. Il s'est dévoué à la Reine, à sa fonction, à son pays et à son peuple pratiquement jusqu'à son dernier souffle. On aimerait bien voir autant de sacrifice et d'abnégation de la part de nos petits politiciens français. La monarchie britannique et les autres monarchies constitutionnelles d'Europe prouvent   que ces régimes politiques savent s'adapter et que les peuples ont besoin de figures qui s'inscrivent dans l'Histoire. Good-bye Prince Philip.
My dear Papa , war sehr berührend u bewegend.  Ich wünsche sehr viel Kraft f d kommende Zeit.
Prince Charles had no grief on his face.
Wishing your whole family members much time to be able to morn in peace and all together and rally around your mother!
He was great person, real aristocrat, strong man and dream husband.. And his sense of humor was so cool)) Thank you for showed us your best and gave great example of the Personality, Prince Philip 🙏🏼 RIP❤️ Deepest condolences to whole Royal Family and whole British nation🌹 No words(( He is nobody to me by I was cry yesterday and today and forced myself to stop it just because of last days of my pregnancy.  Such a light soul he was😥 And how Queen will be without him...
May he rest in peace
😭😢
Yes he was your Royal Highness,we are all very sorry for your loss  The Duke of Edingburgh was a real gentleman Loved by all....
May  Prince  Philips  soul rest  in perfect  peace  .Amen. Condolence  to the Entire  Royal  family and the whole  of the people  of UK
I'm not a massive royal fan but what this guy has done for people all over the world is unfathomable... Countries talk about history.. He's forgotten more than most know... Sorry for your loss our loss
Dearest Prince Charles, my family and I are truly sorry for your loss mostly deep sadness for our Queen.  Yes, we consider her our Queen in America.  Please deliver our sincerest thoughts and heartfelt sadness to our Queen.  The world is mourning her husband's death.  America is not giving up on Prince Harry's return to the UK and regret his departure, or on the Monarchy continuing its history.   May God Bless you all and the Queen.
I am so sorry for your lose.
Losing parent(s) at any age, for a child, is a deep sorrow  RIP Prince Philip 🙏🙏🙏
Deep. Condolences for the family, their sorrow and may the Prince Philip RIP.
I am very saddened by this news. My deepest condolences  to her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Family. May he rest in peace... R.I.P  PRINCE  WILLIAM. was a very special man😔😢
Lost my 99 year old grandfather in January this year. The guidance and the knowledge of these worldly humans is unmatched and they leave an abyss so deep which cannot be filled by anyone or anything. It is always difficult. Rest in Peace, HRH. Rest in Peace all the angels that look upon us.
I had the honour of meeting HRH Prince Charles years ago. I really feel for him, my deepest sympathies to him and his family! This has been a tough year for all of them although it's just started... love and respect from Hungary
bless
My heartfelt sympathies to Queen Elizabeth, Charles, Anne, Andrew, Edward, William and all other members of the family.
Whilst I like the royal family, I just don't like Charles. I hate him, not just for Diana, but there's something about him that makes one dislike him. After this event, I'm sure he is looking forward to being king. But I hope they skip him and make William king - that is if they want to save the monarchy! If Charles becomes king, sadly United Kingdom of Great Britain will become United Republic of Great Britain - ewe, hate to feel that. I very much want the UK to have the stable and loved Royal head of state, as her majesty the Queen is.
So sorry  prince Charles  of your loss 😢
My deepest sympathies to you Prince Charles, to the Queen and the rest of the royal family. My heart breaks for the Queen, rest in peace Prince Philip you were a gentleman, and an admirable man who was loyal to his Queen and country to the end.
All my respect may he Rest In Peace
😔
Condolences to you
A smile at the end.  Why not! THANK YOU and words by heart:  🍃🤍🍃  Here is a sigh and your smile! Beloved words FOR EVERYONE.
Moje najiskrenije saucesce kraljevskoj porodici
about time sorry just being honest.
People say this is pre-recorded. Is this true?
Condolences to Her Majesty  the Queen, the Royal family,  the UK and the Commonwealth nations.  Price Philip lived a life of dedicated service to Queen and country.   He will be greatly missed for his wisdom and great values.   May the Lord Jesus strengthen the Queen and royal family during this difficult time.   Amen.
Have they checked he's not just shed his skin?
Ahrr Thank You for coming out HRH in this very sad time, such a sweet, kind & loving message. RIP HRH Prince Philip, you will be long remembered & sadly missed  a great loss to us all.❤👑❤🇬🇧
What a hypocrite. He destroyed your life especially your adolescence.
Our deepest condolences to the queen and all the royal family from the US. Sending our love and prayers.
По ходу твои родичи не могли дождаться этого момемнта.
My sincere condolences Prince Charles and the entire family. Y'all are in our hearts and prayers! Love from Texas!
Thinking of you all during this very sad time ! Helen South Africa
Lovely words by Prince Charles there! Time, resilience and indeed inner strength makes the healing process less difficult but sadly no amount of comfort nor substitute can ever replace a loved one sadly! 💜
So sad no matter the age🥺
😪🙏🇬🇧👑💐
My deepest condolences to Our Queen & all of the royal family. My thoughts are with you all at this very sad time.
I'm so sorry for your loss. The Queen has a lonely job that I think was made more tolerable by having her husband there as really the only other person in the world who could share it with her and I'm sure she is feeling this loss deeply.
What an honest and earnest, speech, best and most normal, I've ever heard from Prince C.  Harry with his words sounded like he'd lost a valuable Stud horse, (services and will be missed) not a loving grandfather.
God Bless your Papa💙🤗 Hugs to your family🤗💫🙏🏼
To have both your parents until you’re well into your 70s is seriously amazing.
Forever Young Prince Phillip. R.I.P.❤
Very warm and heartfelt elogy by Prince Charles.              warm eulogy by Prince Charles to his late father
My heart is breaking for the Royal Family as we all grieve the death of Prince Philip. 💔
From S/Africa. He was a great figure and much respected. He put the monarchy and Brittain first. It was good that P Charles spoke.
We will miss him very much!!! Wonderful men to a wonderful bless country and a example of love and service to his beloved wife The Queen. Much love and prayers from a little place from California.
He’s in a much better place no more pain RIP
May he Rest In Peace your hinus.
Thank you for sharing about your papa during this sad time.  I have had over the years, some good laughs at many of Prince Phillip’s so called “off the cuff comments”.  I loved his humour and wit.   My deepest condolences to you and your family.  Prayers to everyone and most specifically to the Queen...what a true love story.  RIP Prince Phillip.  God Save the Queen!
I understand the loss of Prince Philip I thought He and the Queen would last forever,it’s all my life I’ve only known these top Royals,It makes me very sad,But Prince Of Wales is there to help the Queen I think he is a kind and wonderful person .
its only been a day u cant miss him that much

Who open the door is it automatic?
He was great dignified and humble with a quite active sense of humor. His devotion to his wife and family unmatched. He will be missed.
The Empire is dead, long live the Realm! God save the Queen. The enemy of theirs is an enemy of mine.
R.I.P...Prins Phillip.and Condolences to Queen Elizabeth.and Family.Death is  Very SAD but Suffering illness is Worse.Prince Charles and Prins William will sure Miss their Pappa.He has been a Loyal Father to His Children .
Dear prince charles, my thoughts and prayer's are with the queen and your entire family at this very sad time.
Love how Charles spoke of his dear papa
Rest in Peace
🙏
Must be very hard for the family having to make public statements when perhaps all they want to do inside is cry and hide. Such strength of character to give even brief statements without breaking down.
🙏💜💜💜💜💜💙💙💙💚💚💚💚💚💚💚✨✨
Phillip will be remembered for his loyalty to the Queen. His endearing smile and cheeky character. He inspired so many young people throughout the world.  Rocks don't disappear they just rest. Look after our Queen Charles.
Condolences from India 🙏🏻 May his soul rest in peace... 🙃🙏🏻

Émotionnellement  or charles trist   ,  1 padre  Inoubliable. Rip  philip 🖤
Deepest sympathy💐🇺🇸🙏
I’m just curious but isn’t it royal protocol for all royals in the family to wear all black in time of mourning or is that just the Queen?
Rest in peace prince philip.  My thoughts are with the family at this sad time.  My heart goes out to the queen.💔
“Gone from our sight, but never from our hearts.” 😢. Condolences to the Royal Family 🇧🇩 🇬🇧
Oh my, we share your loss indeed! Deep condoleances from SAFRICA

R.I.P Prince Philip.  A national loss.
We older people loved Phillip for his way he spoke. He will be missed
Rest in peace. he lived interesting life
Awahhh .  We will miss Prince Philip in America.
I doesn't matter how old you are when your parents die, it's hard.
ive never been a proper fan of the royal family apart from the queen but charles seems such a nice sweet person.
One down many more to go. F the pedos.
Is that only me or Prince Charles was really smiling..
R.I.P ,  Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh!  Your soul rests but your spirit lingers on.
😔
Charles... your words brought tears to my eyes. I admired your Papa and always thought he had a sense of humor like no other. God Bless your Mum and your family. My prayers are with you.
Our Sincerest Respect And Condolences To Prince Charles And Her Majesty  Queen Elizabeth II ..We Wish Her Peace And Strength During This Difficult Time of Mourning..May God Bless You All  Peace And Love From Across-the-Pond 🇺🇸 We Love You!! ❤🤍💙

I had the privilege of meeting Prince Phillip at a reception in Boston in 1992. He was charming and gracious....  My condolences to his family.
I love the English he speaks ❤️💞
I respect this family so much more than any president we've ever had in the US. I've ALWAYS loved and respected your country far more than my own.  I guess that sounds pretty bad on my part, but I won't lie lol. It's the way the royal family LOVES their country and their people. We have presidents that only spend 8 years tops being the "first family ", so how can they know us? 8 years is in no way enough time to truly know, love, and respect the people of your country. I envy your history and that's what I fell in love with.  Not much reason for this, except to say that you and your amazing and kind family are always in my prayers.  I'm so sorry for the loss of such a loyal and special man,  who for so long, was a backbone of your country.  All of the UK and common wealth are in my thoughts. Many people of America are grieving with you, this loss is profound and felt all over the word. I hope your amazing Queen finds peace and comfort in those close to her. Hug her tight for me and my family,  I admire her so much. 💗
Don,t forget you also lost a wife HRH princess DAINA . You never show this respect and love to her you cheated on her throughout your marriage . Anyway sorry about your dear papa. And love you princess DAINA . Wish you were here with all of us today , But you always remain alive in our hearts as the people,s princess
Sale type 😡comme son fils wiwi 😡
All the  empathy from  all of us who love the queen.   Prince  Phillips  and the queen  were very close  , and  that's what  makes it more difficult for the queen.  The  duke of Edinburgh  will always be remembered  for  his supportive role in sustaining the British Family.   Addiu prince philip,  a great warrior and a hero
Accept my condolences. R.I.P. Duke of Edinburgh
My dear dad died very young and I still miss him terribly 35 years later. Thinking of the Royals at this sad time especially the Queen and their children, Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward. X
May he rest in peace. He had a long and exciting life.
My condolences to the Royal Family, especially Her Majesty The Queen.
Rest in peace your royal highness,Thank you for your service and loyalty to our country
Regardless of positions.. It's still his dad. I  hope he locks the doors and allows himself a good cry.  His mom, also.
R. I. P. Prince Philip 🙏
😭😭😭😭👍👍👍👍👍
Great words Charles at this hard time.
I have never been one to stand in crowds and follow people it’s not my “thing” but Prince Philip was a rock to the Queen and served this country and stood as a figure head alongside the Queen.  Nobody can take that away from him.  Through thick & thin he was there but what I did love was his many “gaffs” for want of a better word where he spoke out as he saw it and I actually loved that.    May he rest in peace and may the Queen be comforted by the love and appreciation and respect many many people are showing right now.
Very good of Charles to talk to the press, the world of his personal loss.
Meghan must be disallowed to step foot on our ROYAL soil #LongLiveTheRoyals
God bless Prince Charles for  coming out and thanking everyone in his time of grief 😢💖
A man of few words a man who’s always been quietly cheering and clapping his hands for her Queen and in every achievements his family had made...a very respectful man in deed!!!
So sad about prince Philip,how nice of Charles to make such a  sincere speech..💖
God bless you Prince Charles, Prince Philip was an inspiration and will continue to live on through his family and his incredible contributions to the world!
Gad zmienił ciało na młodsze.
Sending love to the Royal Family and the U.K.
Deepest condolences to the British royal family. God bless you all!
HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was the embodiment and symbol of the British values of commitment, duty , loyalty , friendship to all , honour and valour . His son , Prince Charles is also imbued with these qualities and represents them . Prince Charles might be described for being either too modern or out of touch , so was his father at the time .Like his father  our most beloved Prince and Duke, he cares , he is concerned and devotes his life to the better and good of common man. Huge shoes to fill but Prince Charles is so eminently capable and worthy.and has proven so as Prince of Wales. ( It’s now time for the idiotic brigade to accept that we need , wish and will continue to support  our  apolitical Head id state , our Monarchy speaking for us, helping us. ) RIP , HRH The Prince Philip .
His door magically opens for him! :)
Sorry for her majesty and all the royal family
Condolences to Her Majesty and her family. HRH Prince Phillip provided a sense of foundation and stability for so many throughout the Commonwealth and the world. Much love from Nova Scotia Canada 🇨🇦❤️🇬🇧
It is so sad it is not going to be the same. The world will miss Prince Phillip forever!!!!! He gave everything to be an extraordinary man to his family and country and to the world
Love the scenery by the front door area.  Beautiful and peaceful setting .   I would have never left the UK.  Just saying....
Rip
🙏🏻
Yes your was very special but u are not Charles and your evil wife
❤❤😢😢
Thank you for taking the time and letting us all in such a sad time for the family . I'm glad he spoke for the family and not the monarchy
My sincere condolences on the loss of your Dad, Sir.  I met HRH Philip in Ottawa at Canada’s National Aviation Museum where he inspected my friend’s (Dr. Bob Fasold’s), DeHavilland Chipmunk. We can’t begin to understand your sorrow but we feel the immeasurable loss of a beloved gentleman and Prince.  Our hearts go out to you.  Dr. Stuart Maclean.  Halifax, Canada.
I miss my Papa also. He died 11 years ago. I pray we will all be together again one day in  the name of Jesus. So sorry for your loss.
Heartfelt and loving.    RIP Prince Phillip🙏
A great man, a great family, an example to us all, ty HRH RIP.

Dear Prince Charles, my thougjts are with you.  Bless you and the Duchess  of Corrnwall. God bless Her Majesry. R.I.P. our dear Prince Philip.

I feel for the family. 😔
Nice to see so many notes of support.  I'd just like to add another one, and say how sorry i am for the great loss the royal family is experiencing right now.   Over the next several days and weeks, may each of you find peace, comfort and the understanding that he is in a better place, free from his struggles.   Thinking of you all.  Sincere condolences from New Brunswick, Canada.  RIP Prince Philip.
Not easy, what the prince just did. It’s hard to speak when you’ve just lost your father! It is lovely when you hear wonderful things said about the man you called dad. My condolences.
O eternal Lord God, who alone spreadest out the heavens and rulest the raging of the sea; who hast compassed the waters with bounds until day and night come to an end: Be pleased to receive into thy almighty and most gracious protection the persons of us thy servants and the Fleet in which we serve.
He was a remarkable man. We were all fortunate to have him serve. My condolences to the Royal Family.
Thank you.  Well said, Prince Charles, and to do so in your time of sorrow. May God’s love surround Her Majesty the Queen, his mother, and the family and friends who find themselves grieving for the loss of Prince Philip, as well as their concern and worry they share with the Queen. Deepest condolences during this difficult time. Thank you, Prince Philip, for your loyalty and devotion not only for Her Majesty, but for your many years of service in the U.K.  Rest In Peace, Sir.
Condolences to the Royal family, her Majesty, the Queen, children, grandchildren and great grandchildren of the Duke. God's promise is to one day remove death.  May your hearts be filled with peace.
get a life were living in 2021 no such thing of queens and kings charles u are not a prince were not liveing in 1900s anymore u fool royal family think its 1900s were living in
Blessings to all parents who passed on April 9th, 2021
He wanted to be reincarnated as a deadly virus to help world overpopulation problem. Just the kind of person I admire. Phil was a dirtbag
Sweet tribute.
Bless him and the entire family; especially her Majesty, the Queen.
God Bless Prince Charles 🙏
Prince Charles spoke so beautifully about his father and the people. Rest in Peace Prince Philip.  🙏
My sincere condolences to the Royal Family . What a special person he was . May HRH Philip rest in peace . God save the Queen 🇬🇧🇩🇪😢🙏
Rest in peace 😢
maybe something like this would have been better "as I grieve over the loss of my father, my papa, a strong parent, who had the fortune to engage with so many parents from around the country, the commonwealth and the world, and future parents during his work with the many character building patronages he supported,  I am reminded of the blessings we share in relationship with our parents collectively. And that this binds us collectively So today, that is why I am announcing that all of my fathers wealth, will be donated to....  Thank you for your warm thoughts as we grieve.
Rest In Peace  I love the UK so much ❤️ One of my top favorite countries
My deepest sympathy to Queen Elizabeth and the entire family during this difficult time.  Our heartfelt love and prayers go out to you Prince Charles and your family on this very sad occasion.  Love from Charleston, South Carolina.
My condolences, much love from, America.
A lifetime of service and faithful to the end to the queen and the Country of Britain. Cant find such man in this day and age.
I don't care who you are, when you lose a parent you lose a piece of you!  My heart feels for the Queen and family.  May you rest in peace Prince Philip.
My Condolence to the Royal Family and Her Majesty The Queen.  Prince Phillip was the last of  the Titans.  May God bless his soul and may he rest in eternal peace.
He calls his father the same thing my siblings and I call ours "Papa". How sweet. My condolences to the Royal family on the death of Prince Philip. He was truly a remarkable man.
Philip is one of my favorite royal family members. He had an amazing sense of humor, conquered many wartime struggles and helped push for modernity in the Royal family. RIP and my condolences
Our prince before he changed his name.......Philippos Andreou of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Glücksburg Prince of Greece and Denmark....RIP
Condolences to your Family at this very difficult time of grief and loss. May God Bless the Queen and the Royal Family
His voice was dignified but his face showed the pain
One of the reporters on itv(Catherine) mentioned that she herself had just been on her way to a mourning having just become  a widow herself. Wouldn´t it be a wonderful thing if it were possible to make the funeral into a remembrance of Phillip but to aknoledge the loss of British lives, many of them alone in hospital, at the same time. I thought that the two ceremonies in the US before inauguration and then on the steps of the WH, had a lot of beauty and were really soothing. To me that would bring everybody together in their sorrow and mourning.
Deepest sympathy to the Queen and Royal Family.

And there I stood enchanted staring at the gates of heaven unlocked right in front of me : somewhere between the three worlds .The earth The sea. and The Sky I have waited a lifetime for this ;and when the moment is finally here T is fading ,, What matters more than I are these waves tingling the feet !,,, The breeze soothing the face !,, and this exhilarating sight that awakens my soul soon to become a precious memory !, how can one ever put into infinite words the wonders of this Infinite Universe !
My condolences. Charles has a truly comforting voice.
God Save Our Queen!
Bless the Queen and her family.    Love this family
Indeed all his opposite... At least he participates at a real war not just wearing an uniform with medals and without military achievements like some USSR officials like Stalin' son.

May you rest in peace now after a life time of true loyalty, God bless.

Well done.

I’m glad Charles oldest son Prince William’s loyalty to his family comes before anything, as it should. William learned a lot from his Grandfather.
Thank you your Royal Highness!
Prince Philip is and will always be a special man . You on the other hand. No. Oh and of course. Whatever love means right ?

A racist, that raised a racist family. Condolences to the family, but this is really not a big news that need to be everywhere on the internet.
His lucky he spend over 70 years with his parents not many people are that lucky
I wish to express my condolences to the royal family for the death of  their beloved patriarch.
Yes the Prince Philip was a great man 👨 👏 👍 👌 I am grieved. Now you Princes Charles  🤴  please Secure the queen's peace and individuality during this mourning time. Please Tone down Meghan because she has her own personality and perceptions which don't align to the British culture and customs. Their interview with madam Opra, could have impacted to Prince Philip's 🤴 deteriorated health. The interview was a disgrace to the royal palace at large, and that will be difficult to justify in the interest of the world media at large.  I appeal to you the prince as the eldest child of queen Elizabeth to put things right ✅.  Please Meghan is married to the royalty and we don't understand where she got the influence to move the Prince Harry to other lands other than than the royal home. We want Harry back home. I think she's un cultured. She has to observe the royalty. We are in the Commonwealth wealth and it's a great community since the queen at her tender age, was our administrator in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia.  Let's face the reality. Thank you Sir.
Duncan's construction!!  Prank phone calls
Prince Philip looked like such a funny amazing man. He will be missed
Se le ve la felicidad, ya pronto le llegará su hora,  no de ser rey sino de ser difunto.
Charles will be an excellent king.
As an American I have such admiration for the Royal Family and wish them peace of God during this time. I hope that awful Meghan Markle is not allowed to any funeral functions. To think they put on hypocritic  interview during the time he was in the hospital is just appalling and shameful.
🙏
Heartfelt words from a son of his father...respect Your Royal Highness.
So sorry for your loss...what an extraordinary life he had...Rest in Eternal Peace Prince Philip`~~~~~
Ahh this is sweet Charles.  Lovely!  Dear Papa ❤️
Heart breaking to lose a father, MY HEART goes out to the queen Prince Charles & all the family, Prince Phillip was such a wonderful carictor may he rest in peace 💔❤😇
sure, I can understand that when your parents  died how one feels, very sad thank u and take it easy
God save the queen 👑
Having lost my father last year at 81 you’re still never prepared for the loss of a parent - i’m still adjusting to his loss - prayers and sympathy to the queen and her family 🙏🏽💐
😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔
really feeling for Charles here he seems to be still in shock and utterly bereft. my dad died 2 weeks ago so I can totally relate.
Awe... such lovely, gracious words in a time of grief. RIP Prince Phillip.
😢
Yes your dear papa was a very special man. Deepest sympathy for your family

So so sorry for you prince Charles and your family
Clearly he doesn’t follow the meme accounts
Prayers for you and the Royal family.
We had a special prayer in synagouge like every sabbath for the Royal family , gd bless his soul
Well said and Bless the RF
Gosh I never find Charles to be sincere about anything, am I the only one?
Sincere condolences to all the Royal Family, especially Her Majesty the Queen. Prince Philip gave up his own amazing Naval career to become Queen Elizabeth's consort for 73 loyal years. He made this role his own and performed it faithfully. He has now gone on to a well deserved eternal rest after nearly 100 years. May Prince Philip rest in peace. 💖🙏🙏💖
Dear Prince Charles! Please, accept our sincere condolences on the death of a Wonderful Person, Your dearest Father, HRH Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.  Our thoughts and prayers are with You in this sad moment of Great Loss.🙏✝️🕯️  Rest in Peace Prince Philip! 😢💔🥀  God Save the Queen! 👑
Mi dispiace tantissimo....Porgo le mie più sentite condoglianze alla Regina,  e a tutti i membri della Famiglia Reale. Era veramente un Signore....Ci mancherà molto.    R.i.p.🙏😔😪🌹
Deepest sympathy
HRH Prince Charles made a moving statement in regards to his late father, HRH Prince Philip. I believe HRH Prince Charles was on the verge of tears when he smiled, turned and left the camera. He pulled out his hankie and stepped into the building. Our deepest sympathy, thoughts and prayers for Her Majesty and the entire Royal Family. In Canada, a Commonwealth member, our flags are at half mast in respect for HRH Prince Philip.
Sincere condolences for the loss of your father and the legend he will always be.
He's in Heaven now
Lovely 💕
Gd bless his soul
Can u imagine doing that!!? When your father had just died??? Royal family but still human beings that feel the same love & loss as we all feel... respect 😍❤️
He was closer to his dad than to his mum. My condolences.
Dear Prince Charles 🤴, 🇬🇧 Sorry to hear your loss of your dear father. Duke of Edinburgh had blessed, lovely, longevity life journey on planet Earth. 💐 My deepest sympathy to you and family in the saddest moment. Specially, my dear Queen 👸. May she have the courage to overcome her heart breaking 💔 loss.  Please stay strong. 💘 🇨🇦
Rest in peace, Prince Philip. May this trying time be the source of your family's healing and love.
99 years.. Full of humor, experience, love and service for the queen... You were great. R. I. P.
Thank you Prince Charles- we love your dear Papa x
💖

Well done Charles = Not easy  👏
Bless your heart Prince Charles, for sharing your sensitivity during yours and your family's difficult time.
😔🌹🙏
No one cares
Why would the institute force charles to speak when he is mourning
Short and to the point, very nicely put, dignified heartfelt, those that love the royal family will share in the grief and sadness of losing a wonderful gent.
King Charles may your journey be easy and sorrow be eased.Deepest sympathy to your family.
My condolences from the 🇺🇸 to the Royal family.
Sending love from Clearwater, Florida USA 🇺🇸
Rest in pace 🙏 Prince Philip 💐💐💐💐💐💐
A loving, dignified and simple tribute . No matter our own age or theirs, losing a loved parent is a dreadful blow.
Thankyou for taking the time to speak to everyone about your dear father. It must have been so difficult . My heart goes out to the Queen & all your wonderful family. RIP Prince Philip 💙🙏🙏
Prince Charles turn your brother Andrew to the Americans, so he can sentenced to prison for his molestation days
Condoglianze altezza, a tutte le loro maestà e a sua altezza reale la Regina. Lunga vita alla regina! Preghiamo insieme
My Mother was Canadian
Can someone remind me what the Royal Family did for the Commonwealth? It’s very sad when any person past away and I have tremendous compassion for an old lady who has lost her husband. However, as a Canadian I really don’t think any member of that family have done anything for us.
My deepest and dearest sympathy to you and your family. I share your pain, for he is and will always be a hero and a cherished man.
To the Queen Prince Charles and all the family we send our deepest condolences to you all, Prince Phillip and the Queen have always seemed very close, he has always served the country  and comonwhelth, now it is time to rest in peace.  Our prayers goes out for the Queen x 💔
mis condolencias desde veenzuela a la casa real brithanica
Dear, Prince Charles,  My deepest  sympathies to you and your family, it's hard to lose a parent, it's hard to lose a great man as he was
I can’t imagine experiencing such a loss and then having to remain composed in front of the whole world.  It cannot be easy to be in those roles and essentially have to “perform” no matter the circumstances.
Prince Phillip led a devoted life of service as a Prince respecting and protecting his Queen.  On April 9, the beautiful woman, Lillibet, lost her one true love, soulmate, and best friend!  She will be listening for his footsteps or the sound of his voice where there is none.  My heart goes out to the real Lillibet, his "Sausage" or "Cabbage", who just happens to be a Queen!  Please Father God wrap her in Your love and comfort!  It's Lillibet's heart that is broken ~ not The Queen's.  Sending love, the utmost respect, and condolences from Nashville, Tennessee USA!  💜💜💜
Sorry for ur loss CHARLES, to u ur MOTHER & CHILDREN & GRANDS & everyone who had the pleasure  to have known  him.prayers for ur entire family. 😪❤💜💛🧡🙏💪
So who is king?
Price Charles just made me want to bust in tears when he says; My Dear Papa. I am sending you my deepest heart felt condolence to you and Her Majesty The Queen and the Members of the Royal Family.  I wish, I hav had the opportunity to be at your father's funeral. He was indeed a special person and a True Hero to all of us.......Take your sleep well and Rest In Perfect Peace Our Dear Papa😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Condolence and so sad for your loss. Long live the Queen from Hamilton Ontario Canada.
Thankyou Prince Charles lovely words. My deepest Condolences to Our Beloved Queen Elizabeth and The Royal Family thinking of you at this very sad time sending prayers love 💕 blessings Healing Prince Philip will be greatly missed RIP
It was Charles and Camilla’s wedding anniversary as well. How sad 😞

I am sorry for the loss of your beloved father.  Prince Phillip was a good man, good husband, good father, and good leader.  The world( except Meghan) mourn with the royal family.

I’m very sorry for your loss
💔🥺😭
I may only be 37% British, but I feel the loss of HRH Prince Philp. I pray you and your family find strength and hope in your faith at this time.. May  Prince Philprest in peace!
That was a very sweet statement God Bless them. Rest in Peace
So very sad for your loss. He was an amazing man. God rest his soul, and God save our Queen.
Charles will die even before becoming a king . I think he feels sorry .
It's a sad time for you just now, a light has gone from your life. And your heart is heavy with grief and it seems there is no comfort. But gradually the darkness will fade and your heart will become lighter As you remember your loved one with a smile on your face.
My eyes teared up. Bless the royals. I am so proud of them. Through everything they have gone through they stand strong.
in 99 years Prince Philip lived 99 lives but chose only one Queen Elizabeth 2. The stories of the British crown and the royal family are topics written in the history of the entire planet. Rest in peace and 'God bless a Queen'. Power for Queen many years and life's go on
Makes me sad too. He seem like a great guy
A remarkable man who had a really difficult start in life but never let that hold him back. I always found him to be an inspiration.
Our sincere condolences to the royal family and friends in the United Kingdom, the most sincere equality to you. His Royal Highness was a man loyal to his country and to Her Majesty the Queen and he served the Crown with dedication throughout his life from the United Arab Emirates, may God bless the Queen. 🇬🇧🇦🇪
I just realized that Josh O'Connor really nailed Charles' accent and the way he moves his lips while talking.
So sorry for your loss from Upstate NY, we loved your father and respected him very much! God Bless the Queen and the rest of your family!!
Love and prayers from America.🙌😔😥💓
So sorry for the loss of your Papa thoughts are with you and your family and our Queen always from our house to yours.
He was a mans man and his own man, the rock on which the Queen lent. God Bless his soul/
Our deepest sympathy from the Philippines...
My heart goes out to the whole royal family and especially our majesty the queen may Jesus be your comfort and strength and Joy
Sincere condolences to all members of the Royal family and especially to Her Majesty The Queen. Prince Philip is a huge loss to the world. RIP.
condolences to the royal family.. rest in oeace prince Phillip💐... may the queen be blessed with strength to bear this loss... she is probably going through the hardest of times... losing a partner of 73yrs..❤️
Unfortunately this makes us one step closer to the King Charles era where he pushes the global reset agenda....
End of the Commonwealth! Too late
Never heard his voice before
This is absolutely devastating. I am so so sorry for your loss. He is in a better place now. he lived for 99 years. So blessed!!!
❤️🙏🏻May God comfort the family🙏🏻❤️
Meus sentimentos a família, neste momento tão difícil, que a perda de um ente querido. Que os conforte e abençoe!🙌🙏💐
So sad....🌸🍁🌹⚘
Harry's statement : Thank you for your service , you will be missed " What a cold cold statement . Shame on you Harry
Brilliant
My fear is the Queen, who must be devastated by the loss of her husband, will in turn make herself sick from the grief.  Hope the family never leaves her side.  Take turns keeping her company, try to keep her spirits up, however difficult it may be.
Love from Japan ♥️
Sincere condolences to the Royal family and the British nation on the passing away of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prof DA Lutge
Your father loved his country his navy ship's but most of all he loved his QUEEN Elizabeth was his and he kept to his word he stood by the Queens side till his last breath. He was a strong man with a great wit about him he was my favorite royal he spoke his truth and ment every word. Rest in peace sir
May his soul Rest in Peace.
My condolences.  God Bless you 🙏 all.
Sentido pesame a la familia.
WHY DISLIKES??   LETS ALL RESPECT PRINCE CHARLES AND HIS WORDS❤
God save the Queen, RIP Prince Phillip
So sorry for your  loss and ours as a nation.
A very touching homage to his "Papa". Charles has been demonized by the media, and subsequently the public, for things set into motion that were not entirely his doings. Not to say he's not without fault but, he's not the evil one that he's been depicted to be.
Yes! I agree with simpaticaism! Be strong, courage’s and brave fir your mother, the Queen and the rest of your siblings and family. God bless the Royal family!
So deeply sorry for your loss, our thoughts are with you all at this very sad time...
Dear Prince my heartfelt sympathy to you and your family.  I thank you for speaking to us at this difficult time.  Sending prayers up for you all.
I am severe sorry for your loss. May your father rest eternally with the Lord Jesus.
З життя пішла велика Людина, взірець для всіх чоловіків Світа. Українці щиро співчувають ЇЇ Величності, Королівській родині та народам Великої Британії. Боже храни Королеву та Велику Брітанію.
OUR END: DEATH
I deeply thank you for this, Sir. So sorry for you and your family's terrible loss.
May his soul rest in peace🙏
Condolences from Srilanka🇱🇰

سلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته تحيتي السيد الرئيس المحترم

Well spoken sir.... With dignity I absolutely adored Prince Philip what a character, what a fantastic sense of humour, politicaly incorrect at times and didn't suffer fools especially journalists asking silly questions... We love you sir... We miss you sir... The world is a much more boring place with you RIP sir... Sadly missed 🙏
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️
Deepest condolences to the royal family. The loss of a father and a husband is devastating at any age.
RIP prince Philip. I hope the Queen is in good health so she can outrun Charles
As far as i know charles relationship was not great with his parents but being in Public life ans royal family they got to pretend and play the game! Prince chalres himslef is 70 years now.
The whole World has lost a man who can never be duplicated. His devotion his honor and his duty. In this World we just don't see this happening anymore. This is a sadness for the Queen and your Family that is heartwrenching. The whole World grieves for your Family. Gods speed Prince Philip and God Save the Queen.
Rest in Peace, Prince Philip ! 💔
I lost my father when I was 11 years old. There isn't day that I  remembered him with love and sadness. I miss him deeply.
99 years old des on the 9 turn it around 666
Lovely words , feel for our Queen and her family
😓
R.I.P dear Prince phillip you done our country the commonwealth proud I feel for the Queen to lose such a lovely man I feel for you please except my condolence
My deepest condolences to the Queen, to Prince Charles and all the members in the Royal Family... Prince Phillip will be missed... 😢I hope that during this sad time, family stays strong and together as ever. My grandparents passed away long time ago and our family bond was what made us overcome the sadness, even until today, though not a day goes by that I don’t miss them.... I feel your pain, prince Charles...
🇮🇸🌈
PrincePhilip will be sadly missed,I cannot imagine the RF or the UK without him💔😥😥🇬🇧🇬🇧
Condolences to Queen and Family. I know the feeling well. It is not easy so I Pray God gives them Strength and Patience. The Family unit is never the same. But I'm sure our strong Queen will keep it together. So sorry for her and all the troubles that keep getting dumped on her. She deserves a Peaceful Mourning period with no more Dramas.
Loving words of a son about his father
Rest in Peace Prince Phillp and my condolences to the Queen and her family. May God put his loving arms around u and the family!.
My sincere condolences. Prince Philip was a good person at heart I will miss him very much.🙏🕯😭👑🇬🇧🇩🇪
Deepest condolences to HM THE Queen,  Prince Charles and all the family, God Bless prince Philip, rest in peace, God save the Queen.
What a beautiful way to speak about his father during such a difficult time. I have shamelessy learned more about Hr Prince Philip these past 24 hours then i ever knew. However what has always struck me is his absolute devotion to his queen and wife ''Lillibet''. Never easy for a man such as him to stay on the sidelines and fully support his wife whilst sacrificing his career. You will be sadly missed and my thoughts are with the family, because when all said and done although Royals, they are just a family who have lost their father, her husband, a grandfather and great grand father - RIP DOE
Awe, I’m so sorry for you Prince Charles, your mother Queen Elizabeth and the whole Royal family.  God Bless and Godspeed.
Love you and love royal family
RIP Prince Phillip. Hope your family finds peace
well done
Thank you Charles to take the time for us all  so sad for you're mother and all the family  thank you.
I feel so sad for them all.
🤧🤧🤧🤧😢😢😭😭😭😭😭 may the prince rest in peace🖤🖤🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🤴🤴
My condolences 🌷
Well done...he will always reside in the hearts of many, his integrity, humour, and love of family and gracious love of all...a true hero!
My condolences to the royal family..
God save the Queen ❤🇬🇧
How sad it must have been very hard for Prince Charles to make this small but amazing speech. Thinking of the queen and all.the royal family at this sad time. Rest in peace Prince Phillip 🤴🙏
Good bye king rest in peace
Words cannot adequately express our sympathy at this time.   We are so sorry for your loss, Prince Charles.  May God bless and comfort you all.
Door closes . Ok let's eat some babies everyone . Yay
Prince Philip's oath during Queen Elizabeth's coronation "I Philip ,Duke of Edinburgh do become your liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and faith and truth I will bear unto you, to live and die, against all manner of folks”  Such a great man who stood true to his words supporting her with all his strength, taking two steps back walking as her shadow , protecting her , guiding her throughout his life and being the solid support for their family Rest in Peace Prince Philip
💚💚💚🇬🇧
Permit me, Your Highness, to send You and to all Your family, my sincere condolences. Your father was a very great man, before to be a prince, before to be a W. W. hero, before all, he was and still remain for ever an unforgettable example of British gentleman from all point of view. R. I. P. Prince Philip. 🏵️
Charles his was a wonderful father my he r .I.p
He doesn't say anything in particular... they always say things in general manners and that's why the news are reporting the same information over and over again.
My very deepest and sincere prayers to the Royal family on the great loss !! May God lift you up and give you peace in your hour of sorrow. Grandma in AZ :(
Love and prayers are with you and your family, Sir.
💔
I am close to my beloved Queen of the United Kingdom, Her Majesty Elizabeth II. I am close to HM and all Her Family, in this moment of sadness and pain for the loss of her beloved husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh of Greece and Denmark. God Save Our Beloved Queen!

May God’s perpetual light shine upon him.
Service? What kind of service did he perform?
Lost my dad a few years back. I Still miss him deeply.  May Prince Phillip rest in the arms of The Father. My Love to the Royal Family and the British...
I hope, Dear Prince Charles, you will be able to shake off the divisive Oprahs and Gail Kings of this world and repair the damage they have stirred up in your family so that the bedsides of the nearest and dearest are filled with the loving faces and tender hearts you have been blessed to have and deserve to have when they are needed the most. Happy to read of your milestone anniversary to the lovely Camilla!
Rest in peace Prince Phillip! 🇬🇷🇬🇧
In memoriam Prince Phillip
I am an American and the 9th cousin of Diana, Princess of Wales.  I hope, sir, you never become king.  I pray that God sees fit to raise William to the throne and skips over you.  I also pray that England becomes Catholic again.
Rip Prince Phillip
The Queen has lost her one true love, her husband of over 70 years she was in love with him practically her whole life she must be devastated.
He must be really missing him so much beyond our Imaginations, he took his time to come in front of Press, feeling really sorry for him, Prince Philip was a really good person, and now know he was really good Father, Feeling sorry for Queen she not only lost her Husband also her Best Friend  May He Rest in Peace
To the Royal family. I send my condolences and prayers. Prince Philip was a great person and loved Queen Elizabeth and the family. I feel like I am a part of your family.  Take care.  Sandra from Mt Vernon Wa.
Bless you Sir for taking the time when you are grieving the loss of your dear papa to talk to us.  Those over a certain age remember him well, from the handsome blonde standing protectively at your young mother's side through his many interests and quirky quips to the man who loved his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.  The world is showing their appreciation of a much loved man.
💐💜
Yes he is a special criminal.
Pfft.  Phillip was a better man than you will ever be.
😥😥😥🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Dante believed in the Divine Comedy: that those on the way to heaven through purgatory are fuelled and lifted by the prayers of those they left behind. May HRH arrive at the pearly gates on a chariot with wheels of fire. May he rest In peace, and God save the Queen.
Papa...???  18th Century
that smile doesn’t say he’s sad lol
Prince Charles, a wonderful thing to do for the citizens of the UK and Commonwealth.  But Phillip is at rest now, he will be missed. God save the Queen.
Deep condolences.
He looks so much like his father at 0:49. Prince Phillip may be at eternal rest but his memory and legacy will live on.
Thanks, Charles!
My love and prayers to you all
R.I.P.
My sympathies to you all.
Rest well Prince Philip
Yes Prince Charles, your father was a very special person. Not always the easiest of fathers necessarily, despite his outstanding admirable qualities. I was moved by the story of him being found under a table playing with the small son of Jaqueline Kennedy when the little boy was wondering wherehis father was. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🍁

Racist

Great job sir!  You are so well spoken and genuine!
It’s so sad. Rest in peace Prince Philip🕊🤍

Philip was quite a man. A real man, imo. The queen truly loved him, and my heart hurts for her. Princess Anne is said to be his favorite, and the son he never had. She, too, doesn't suffer fools. May Prince Philip rest in peace.💓

Sending condolences to all the Family. Prince Philip was of the generation where the 'ordinary' achieved the extraordinary. His death is all the more poignant in light of the circumstances we are all in - it is highlighting the importance of family, love, service and remembrance. May the God of all comfort strengthen & sustain you during this tender time. God bless.
Prinz Charles Mein Aufrichtiges Herzliches Beileid 😢🕊️ich wünsche der Königsfamilie viel Kraft.
Blessing and condolences to the royal family. God save the queen.
My heart felt his sorrow and the love he has for his father
My deepest condolences to Prince Charles and his family.
My condolences.🌸🌷😥❤
So sad right now I'm thinking about queen 😭
Lovely words from Prince Charles, may your father rip
We share your loss also. We are deeply saddened by his death and regret that he did not make his hundredth
Charles loves Clarence House, but is in his glory in the gardens of Highgrove. He'll have peace there to mourn and adjust to whatever alterations must now be made within the family firm.
condolences from germany 🇩🇪❤🇬🇧
The most saddest part is that prince Phillip passed away on prince Charles and Camilla’s anniversary

Condolences Prince Charles.I miss my papa he died 23 years ago with throat cancer and left a family of eight. Miss him every single day .The  Welsh rugby team keeps us going and we shout at TV like he did bless him.😔🙏
I've never liked Charles more than I do right now.
Condolences from Greece.  His Royal Highness Prince Phillip's birthplace. We send you all our love. 💌🙏🏼🇬🇧🇬🇷
Oh bless him. Please leave them alone allow them privacy to grieve for their father. Let her Majesty time to reflect and to prepare herself for a life without her beloved husband. Please members of press, it is not time to start talking about negative moments in the life of these people. Be kind and respectful
RIP 🙏to Duke of Edinburgh. Condolences to the Royal Family.
God Bless the Queen and her family!
RIP Prince Philip, a truly great Briton
Prayers hugs and best wishes to you and your family at this sad time
Proud to be British ❤💛💚
did his ghost open the door on the way out?
A prayer for HM Queen Elizabeth II. Almighty God, who hast set our gracious sovereign Queen Elizabeth II upon the throne of this realm, and given her to surpass all others in the years of her reign: Receive my heartfelt thanks for her service to her people. Watch over here now more than ever in the light of her husband’s passing The Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip. and so replenish her with the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that she may always incline to Thy will and walk in Thy way... Endue her plenteous with heavenly gifts. Grant her, in health and wealth, long to live. Strengthen her, that she may vanquish and overcome all her enemies and, finally, after this life... she may attain everlasting joy and felicity through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. God Save The Queen!
He was very “Dear” he also ruin his and Camila’s wedding anniversary 😅🤣
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Condolences from Canada 🇨🇦
Prince Charles is right, at this time is since yesterday millions of people all over the world but mainly in the countries of Commonwealth are sharing the pain and sadness at the loss of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh.
I feel very sorry for Charles and his immediate family. They've had to endure knowing that Prince Philip was very ill and in all likelihood not going to survive on top of a wayward son's wife in America giving the most damaging and disingenuous interview after she was welcomed with open arms.  What a stressful time for the RF.
My condolences to you Prince Charles and to the Royal Family! 🕊️
I feel really bad
Prince Charles looks very sad😔. My condolences to him. 💐❤️😢
God Save The Queen  May His Royal Highness  Prince Philip Rest in Peace
RIP Diana❤️❤️
Whole world is with d royal family..HRH the Queen
😭💔
His time for being king is coming. In 10 years maybe there will be a king Charles
What an extraordinary man What an extraordinary life So  heartbroken for The Queen and the family
For him to say I am sorry papa and say goodbye to me you were kind enough for me for the real purpose hello to the person I am say good bye to the world....
God save the King
Prayers & my deepest sympathy to our Queen & to her whole family. 🙏💐🇨🇦
"my dear papa" made my eyes water.
His father was a very special person. His youngest son on the other hand.......what an idiot.
Podrías traducir en español gracias?
With Diana's death, we know you will never become like your father. Not even 1%. Shame on you ! He was the greatest consort UK will ever see.
In these type of momenta, it's not about royals,prince,Queen or any other titles... it's about family! The love, support and the pain of losing a husband,a father ,a grandfather. I hope Harry and Meghan will be there( even though Meghan is pregnant,I don't think she will attend)
For  the world wide appreciated royal family of the United Kingdom , the Prince of Wales has found wonderful words of mourning and greatful thoughts. Bless them all and  God save the Queen!  With respect for the Duke of Edinburgh and deeply felt condolences for his family
Diana will live forever♥️🌎
This completely eclipsed those pathetic "heartfelt" words by Haz and Meg. My thoughts and prayers are with you, Prince Charles ❤️
I admire their strenght
Good bye HRH
So sad
Along with countless others, I recently lost my grandfather to covid.  We weren't able to have a funeral due to restrictions and it truly felt surreal to not be able to mourn properly.  Therefore, I feel particularly close in spirit to the royal family currently and truly wish them well.  These days of mourning and remembrance feels like a good time to remember all the wonderful people we have recently lost.  May Prince Philip RIP and his family be comforted at this difficult time.  Thank you for the service of this remarkable man, and the others lost from this amazing generation.  RIP Prince Philip and to my Papaw
In France, we don’t have Royal Family as you know, but as Great Britain is our best and older « friennemies » the Windsor family are, in our hart, a little bit as our Royal family too... The Duke was a great Men and a Great support to is Family, is humour was famous even if it was borderline sometimes... I give my sinceres condolences to her RH the Queen, all his family, friends and off course to all British peoples and from commonwealth. 🇬🇧🇫🇷🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🍀 Amitié sincères  Céline Picchiottino French citizen who feel English in my heart today.

Dear Prince charles , Thank you for taking time out to speak to us all today , it is very much appreciated. Yes your dear Papa was a very special man and will be missed terribly.  Deepest sympathy to you , the family and especially for our Queen on the loss of her beloved husband.  I was very taken by one message from a head of state , when he concluded his speech , saying he hoped the commonwealth nations would now play the part of the Queens strength and stay in life.
I would happily take a few years off my life to keep the Queen going
May Prince Philip rest in Peace! My condolences to the Royal Family from Brazil.

Very sorry for the family's loss and the loss to the nation.

So, so sad. I hadn’t been following the Royal Family prior to William’s wedding— but I appreciate how Charles in his quiet way is growing into his own. Such difficult times! Prince Philip was such an interesting and admirable man 💐🕊
Thank you for sharing these thoughts with us. I lost my father (at 90) this year, as well. My heart goes out to you. xo
I always wondered what prince Charles called his father.  I really feel for the queen. Not easy to lose a spouse who has always been there for over 70 years with her. 😔May he rest in peace.
🙏😪
Anyone tamil here
Phizza was the man 🙏
Prince Charles, I send my deepest sympathies to you, the Queen & the Royal family. Prince Philip was the greatest kind of man of all men. May God comfort & sustain you, the Queen & the royal family as you mourn such a tremendous loss to the commonwealth and the world.
He has now rested with the seas
So sad..rest in peace prince Phillip
All the condolences from Oman 🇴🇲❤🇬🇧 We share your sorrows Our friends ❤ RIP  💔
Blessings and condolences to Prince Charles. Losing your Dad in life doesn't make it any easier; I lost my Dad when I was 60.
I have so much admiration for the Royal Family, always hounded by the press and enduring so many false news reports. May Her Majesty the Queen and all the members of the Royal Family find strength, solace, and love during the sad days ahead.
You should be proud of him.
😢💙💕
