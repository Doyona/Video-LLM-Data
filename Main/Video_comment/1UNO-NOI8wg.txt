I was going to comment here on my secret 2022 channel but it has so many subscribers and zero videos so YouTube thinks the comments are spam so uh... yeah here's the link instead LMAO https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTrLCM86b-0eOVDSyJtCMYA
I can't handle how sad he looks when he tells this story 😢
14:29 D'Anglo is a God of culture. i only found about this dude because of the Zara Larson song. symphony.
15:16 -I feel so immature but it came out of nowhere and caught me off guard, so I burst out laughing. Anyway, the cutoff of her singing made it sound like she sang “bais”, which in swedish means “poop” 💀
T-Pain the icon you are 💖💕💝💘💓💗
Just found this video in 2024, but yes!!! I LOVE T-PAIN! Why was everyone featuring T-Pain if he "ruined" music? Also, he CAN sing. He just likes the sound of using autotune. If you don't like autotune, don't use it, and leave T-Pain out of it! Damn! Poor guy!
Love T-Pain, and I listened to Computer Love every day when it came out 😊
if tpain sucks then why does good life go so hard
That’s the INDUSTRY @ Fault 🙄🤷‍♀️🙄 not TP?‼️? He doesn’t have the power to RUIN Music 🎶  Let’s get Real IMO I get Usher’s point, but the industry is accepting & producing ALL of it. The Fans /Public certainly recognizes talented Singers & highly appreciates it  but we can like a song / vibe TP’s song or another artist 💯🤷‍♀️🤯 It kills me TP was impacted by Usher’s 🔥💩🔥 overly dramatic/inaccurate stmt AS IF TP has the power to ruin or control the music 🎼 industry 🙄🫨🫨😵‍💫🫨 I think U is jealous of TP’s impact on the music genre in general. ✌️❤
It hasn't gone bad. Its an over saturated market that we are now open to thanks to the internet.
I'm super late to this party but I hope you've heard Dimash Kudaibergen sing, I think you'd really like him. And yeah, I also really like the sound of auto-tune
His part in black n yellow was so golden its so weird listening to the version without his part
i went and listened to that willow song immediately!! tysm for introducing me to another black rock artist!!!!! 🥺♥️
the reason autotune took off was not because of the autotune but because t-pain could sell it
Thank you for mentioning the whole ‘just one sentence can push someone into deep crap’ thing. I feel like not enough people understand that because they’ll be like ‘oh you’re just dramatic!’ But they don’t even understand how much it hurts.
Only reason anyone's talked about Usher recently is because Keke Palmer's (hopefully ex) boyfriend got mad at the outfit she wore to his concert.
that's like saying madoka magica ruined the magical girl genre because, from it's release, a bunch of edgy grimdark magical girl shows came out.  like, no. Madoka magica did something different, and it did it well. people liked it and tried to imitate it without quite understanding why it was so good, which means their derivative works will be less good.
Tpain did a song with watsky that is my summer anthem, mans an angel
I am anti-pitch correction/autotune, but what Usher did was downright horrible. He literally blamed one man for killing music. T-Pain only made music with stuff like that for an intended effect. He didn't do it to improve bad vocals or whatever. Personally, I wouldn't use pitch correction/autotune, but I wouldn't blame one man for the deevolution of music. It was the producers that wanted that in the first place, not even the singers.
Autotune is literally just another tool in any audio engineers abundance of tools, and people need to chill tf out about it  Literally 99.999% vocal parts in music you hear have compression and eq on them, yet no one tells vocalists they just need to get better at controlling their resonance and articulation/loudness.  I'm a deathcore/metalcore vocalist/singer, and tbh, my vocals would sound terrible without any mixing, but so do most other raw vocals, and refining them with digital tools is just as much a skill as doing vocals themselves. (Not to mention how many mixing plug-ins are also used for stylistic effects beyond their intended purpose, for example, autotune in t pains music or the exorbitant amount of guttural vocal compression in Hans Zimmers Dune Soundtrack.)  It's like saying a guitar player has no skill cause they use an Amp to achieve their sound.  In the end the only thing that matters is if people like the music, and if they do, an artist is most likely doing something that works for them and their audience.
artists will clearly use heavy autotune for a specific effect and people will assume that clearly they're just using heavy autotune because they have no musical or vocal talent whatever You'd have to be doing something very wrong in melodyne to make the autotune sound that prominent if you're only using it for pitch adjustments
This is hilarious because not once did he ever hide his autotune.
Autotune in extra generic pop singers Also not good
Usher is good t pain is good the over use of autotune aka trappers = trash that’s all
T Pain was so amazing on the Masked Singer. He was truly breathtaking and extremely talented. He did auto tune for the sound, for the style, it was new to the industry and it WORKED. He has an amazing voice and talent and he is just an amazing and genuine human being. And you can see it in all of his interviews. I idolize T Pain through and through.
I saw a TikTok from a boomer that was just like, 10 secs of 100 gecs, with text overlay saying something along the lines of T-Pain is to blame. 🤪
People have been using auto tune since like the 80’s bands like the Zapp band especially with R&B music. Before Usher was even thought of. But T-pain just made it popular. But I totally agree with you D’Angelo. That wasn’t very nice of Usher or correct. 😭
Love his music, love his personality, he's a flat earther tho
8:33 I actually thought it WAS T-Pain on that song, not Usher, for a long time. An embarrassingly long time.
Usher was dead wrong for all the reasons you listed. And to use the sound for your own work? I grew up on both of them so Usher definitely lost some of us with that take
kinda dickriding lol
One of Usher’s biggest hits that nearly saved his career was an auto tuned single so like…… what is he talking about?
H.E.R. And Giveon ❤
His voice without auto tune is amazing
well regardless if i know or find out you use auto tune or pitch correct i would simply stop listening to there music  because i simply dont like that  kinda music i do not condone  i do not agree with it but   while i dissagree i can still respect  it
People thinking way to deep into this, tf.
Every art becomes saturated by varying quality works after some point once it can turn a profit, anyways. What a poor outlook on art either way on Usher's part - if you don't like something, just move on. Plenty of "bad" art is still created from a deep place, just be mature if you personally dislike it. I can't imagine telling someone they ruined a form of expression because of.. the way they chose to express themselves.
All I got to say is..... COMPUUUTER LOOOVE
D’Angelo is sooo based.
I don’t understand why Usher felt the need to wake T-Pain up from his sleep just to destroy his ego for no good reason 🤷🏻‍♀️
ok i don't necessarily THINK the next video is gonna be about this but i'd love to hear d'angelo talk about qanon and read them into the ground
Anyone who has ever played one of those karaoke games on their phone knows that autotune does not fix a bad voice skskskksks. You still need a talented voice for autotune to sound good.
“And one of the people who i didn’t think would put me through it just…shoves me through it-” Let me tell you, i had a physical reaction
Thumbs up and an additional comment to beat the algorithm. Thanks for the video! 👍🔥👍
I don’t think it was just that comment… it’s also the trauma of betrayal. T-Pain thought Usher was his friend, that he had his back. Something clicked in that moment, with that comment, that let T-Pain know that all this while a person he had love and respect for was actually hating and scheming. Usher simply didn’t have the same impact, and those who lack creativity become experts in cruelty.
One time at work, this lady said, "Just sit there and look pretty." to me, and it ruined my mood for the whole day and added to my inferiority complex. Thank you, random karen. ☺️
Auto-Tune soulful? I guess, if you consider robotic as soulful.
Usher being a purveyor of FOTM pop hip-hop has no right to be talking about others ruining music, especially to someone so nice and clearly he popularized something that people like.   It 10000% sounds like he's jealous.
T-Pain’s tiny desk changed my life, helped me realize how wrong I was about modern rap
The thing is, i love natural voice and all, but there are a lot of bands that uses HEAVY AUTOTUNE that i love... 1, fear and loathing in las Vegas ( the japanese band, not the movie 😂 ) 2, porter robinson And many more 😂  Every single one of them are bangsrs but they never stop me from seeking natural voices, i equally like both 😂
Jesus. I don't even much enjoy t-pain but I can sure as hell respect the inventiveness and talent that went into mastering the use of that tool as an instrument in its own right. As well as everything else said here.
another thing about T Pain is he is a sweeteheart so this sucks even worse lol
Going to be honest, since you always put your face on the right of your thumbnails, I thought the picture of T. Payne was a picture of you and kept thinking “wow this guy looks different”
I just saw Shamir on D'Angelo's show. This is a good sign.
I hate auto tune. Horrible sound and vibrations.
Even T-Pain's guest appearances on I'm on a Boat was a cultural moment
me over here listening to my breakcore headache music nodding like yyesyesyes normal vocals and normal sounds yesyes
Auto tune has been around for as long as one could remember and suddenly now people are freaking out about it (even though people have complained about the use of it in general before). I bet a lot of these people’s faves sing with autotune at some point and never realized because it can be quite subtle. Autotune can apply to a voice to make an effect you can’t usually do naturally.
Not gonna lie, the "you cant have an autotune sound good if you cant sing in the first place" really aged badly LOL All it took is a tiktok of a sound engineer being pissed to not be credited by an artist who then in retaliation leaked the real voice of the signer without his autotune and then ppl realized how ANYBODY can "sing" as long as they have someone who can autotune well theur voice 😂
Auto Tune didn’t kill R&B and neither did T-Pain. The music industry shifted and that’s all. It’s not much different from Rock not being as big as it used to be. The industry will keep shifting and maybe R&B might return to the limelight one day…
Usher was offended by having to release a track WITH autotune and should have been upset with the industry not T-Pain. Autotune gets over used, but T-Pain is a great artist.
Autotune's a tool in the same way a capo is a tool, in the same way a delay plugin is a tool, in the same way a vocoder is a tool, in the same way a parametric EQ is a tool. They're all used to cut corners and get things done faster.  I don't get what the whole fuss is about, because if you're a really bad singer people will know you're bad even with autotune because it just sounds fucked up.
Damn, Usher was dead wrong for that. Real knavish behavior. Not just morally wrong, factually too.
every artist uses auto-tune or some pitch correction like melodyne.
I never listened to T-Pain because his music genre is not one I usually listen to, but this video proves that he is objectively immensely talented and seems like a genuinely kind and good person, and he deserves to have everything good happen to him!
Can anyone please tell me the background music in this vid? It's killing me that I can't tell where it's from.
T Pain can definitely sing, he used autotune as a style, not a crutch. It's not his fault lack-ass people wanted to embody the style.
13:16 somebody PLEASE help me find this bit of FKA Twigs I am desperate
All opinions are fine and you can have whatever one you want, but saying pitch is the least important thing in singing and all those other things are above it is just flat out false lol pitch is hands down the MOST important thing when it comes to singing... All the other skills don't mean a thing if the singer is singing out of key. Everything else can be faked or simply non existent in a live performance but aside from using autotune if you're out of key you can be singing as high or low or powerfully as you want and it will be awful and even an untrained ear will be able to hear it. Pitch is the very first and most important thing about singing that is instantly heard without even looking for it.
the chloe low range is real?? what??? someone pls link me to that video
usher talk a lotta shit for someone who throws fake money in the club
Rosalía, the Catalan singer and songwriter, has one of the most incredible voices of hispanic modern music. She uses the Autotune effect as just that: an effect. She doesn't need it, she explores it as one more sound ingredient, which contributes to the creation and production of a song.
The only reason I know T-Pain is from Bar Rescue, and from what I know he seems like such a sweetheart and a very kind man
Cher did it before Tpain. It's all Cher's fault 🤣
Tpain and lil Wayne basically normalized auto tune……
Usher acting like he doesn’t use auto tune at all🙄
If you all go back to the 70's/80's fantastic group Kraftwerk (love Kraftwerk)or Cher's Believe (90's hated this) there's a place for it but not for real voices. I can't listen to most now as mostly all are Autotuned.
I personally hate Autotune voices and music but Who does Usher think he is?
Autotune is bad when used wrong but the whole "autotune bad" fasad that everyone is living is stupid.
Is the fact that he literally won the first season of the masked singer because k  didn’t nobody pinpoint who was in the costume, because people didn’t expect T-paim to know how to sing, that man knows how to sing, if you ever paid attention to him when he’s not using auto tune, and for people to have the audacity to say that he ruined music by using auto tune. it gave him a unique sound yes, but he absolutely did not need it.
💚💚💚 Thank you for shining your light onto T-Pain. 💚
Imagine waking your friend up from their airplane nap to give them 4 years of depression because you're just that bitter and insecure
yeah its kinda fucked that somebody who you think to be your friend has said you ruined something you both love because you got blew up by making a staple in a genre, it isn't his fault people copy him, thats like blaming every other popular artist for the fact that other people want to come up so they just make something similar to what everyone likes at the time and at that time it just happened to be tpain, whose art STILL stands the test of time. it's just kinda mean bro.
Lol bro you don't need to sing  You just need to know how to talk and make a beat
You humble me so much I hope to God T-pain saw or sees this.
Not that the willow smith album wasn't a bangger but that ad came out of nowhere lol
This is my first time seeing this video and I need to correct something - Cher popularized the use of auto tune, not T-Pain. Her song Believe back in 1998 uses it throughout the song. Rarely, but it's there.
t pain didnt cause auto tune to be popular. he just was creative when being honest with its use instead of lying about it, created something unique for the time, and people hate him for it. cool. but like cher is great right? how creative!
2 of the most revolutionary people in the music industry post 2000 - t pain and soulja boy
Maybe usher was mad he had to rip off pain to get a hit after 2008 🤷‍♀️
t pain and ye the masters of autotune
autotune is just one of many artistic choices used by musicians. t-pain would be just as successful without it, and autotune is just one of those artistic decisions he uses to improve his craft. sure, other artists can use it badly, but that's not his fault.
I didn’t even know who T-Pain was before this video
T. Pain should absolutely be a Disney prince or main character 😍😍😍
These days I'm honestly more annoyed with people gatekeeping what constitutes "good music" than I am with artists using plugins
I need therapy
I have 2 opinions on this, both optimistic: 1. If auto-tune helped other people (the less musically talented) express themselves through music, then T Pain's popularization of auto-tuning is a great thing! 2. If auto-tuning can make bad music bareable and even popular, then wouldn't innovative and talented artists be able to use auto-tuning to make great musical ideas even better?
You fucked up music D’Angelo
T-Pain didn’t ruin music. Unoriginal producers, artists, and executives who wanted to cash in on the success of auto tune ruined music.
Your always looking at me like I’m insane =_=
How many women have you all allowed to do what We just asked
Thank you because I’m on the bus and now I’m going to be humming “I think I need her to drink a drink with me” all day at school 🌝
He was huge when I was in high school. It makes me sad to see how he's been treated. He is so talented and is smart as hell but now people drag on him over the style of vocals he chooses to use. I was so excited when he won masked singer because he proved to haters that he can actually sing. Back when I was in High school we absolutely jammed to his music and ill continue to love his stuff.
Roger trotman from zapp and Roger created the auto tune. t-pain just made it popular. I don't agree with what usher said to t-pain
He's trying to nap on a plane... and gets woken up to have his friend say that shit to him... that's cold
This is probably a very unpopular opinion. But I honestly think usher called t pain in there to tell him he “ruined music” because he was jealous. Music was changing. Usher was struggling to stay relevant. And he knew t pain was making music that everyone liked and changed the industry. 🤷‍♀️
T-Pain met with the creator of Autotune and spent 2 years learning how to properly use it. T-Pain brought it back!
I got and ad for autotune lol
i just got an auto tune ad at the start of the video lol
Wait... it's 2022...
His voice is amazing he doesn't need auto tune. He is an artist!
He created auto tune. He is the master behind it!
I fucking love this video, 10/10
I actually am hurt.What do you mean you’re not a coffee person…wow.
Again.. couldn’t of said it any better 🙏🏼
Hurting Daddys.  I need u home  I'm ok tho
As someone who struggles with depression, a comment can stay with you forever. You would randomly think about a comment someone made and it would destroy you even if it wasn't meant to or it wasn't a big deal to the other person.
Ummmmm....ok: Cher had the shit in that annoying song that South Park made fun of, "Do you belieeeeeeve in looooove" 🤢 Fkkn Tupac had that shit on Califonia Love...T Pain certainly was not the first to fkk ANYTHING up! 😂
Usher is a conceited prick. I hate auto tune....HATE IT, but again, Usher is a prick.
Ha who tf is usher to say anything, it goes to show how shite his music is if people preferred a robot-like voice to his dead ass music.
Please release another video! I’ve been binging allllll your content and I need new sooo badddd!
So everyone not using ACTUAL musical instruments to make music ain't a musician at all.
dang, usher took an s-ranked L on this one.
Usher really out here thinking he the king of RnB ain't he?
DO PEOPLE THINK T PAIN INVENTED AUTO-TUNE? this is the first time I’m using all caps but my goodness people are stupid. R&B was not ruined it just changed. It happens. Just because artists aren’t putting out Boys 2 Men style ballads doesn’t mean T-Pain ruined music. I really hope T-Pain watches this video. He’s internet savvy enough I believe he just might.
Jacob collier is my angel 😍😍😭😭😭
I just have one question. Does t pain sounds like a robot?  Thas why usher is right
Tpain is the one who promoted the proper usage of auto tune in songs. It's bizzare to claim otherwise. Don't understand how these people think they have a leg to stand on
I hope T Pain sees this video & he comes out of his depression. He deserves the best.♥️
If you can't carry a tune in a bucket, autotune is for you. using it as an effect or an aesthetic is less detestable. honestly who cares?
their mentality is “damn guys hand sanitizer really plummeted after ebola, ebola ruined hand sanitizer”
can Auto Tune ruin some songs YES did it ruin music as a whole? hell no
Imagine waking up on a plane and your friend asks to talk to you on a trip to an awards show where you will see people in the same industry and same passion as yours. Imagine simply singing because that’s your passion, and then you get told you ruined that same industry 😬
Just because someone's music has a lot of auto tune in it doesn't mean they are ruining music it just means that it's how they does music and in the music industry everyone has his own sense and way but if ur a singer that think like that and feel yourself obliged to use auto tune so that u can actually catch up with them it just means that ur music isn't the best which is why ppl aren't gravitating towards hearing it and they are going to someone who uses a lot of auto tune because they feel it's better than urs which also means that ur just insecure about ur music not to mention the fact that u said it to his face..
Haters. T-pain was the main contributor to the soundtrack to my teen years into early 20s
autotune has been around for a minute , but T-pain started a new genre of music he should  be proud to having been such a influence  on  music as a whole
This video is so needed
I got butterflies when D'Angelo said BTS 😭 why do I love this guy?? He's sooo cute
You just put me on so much good music in one video
t pain did kill r&b you a bozo for this one lol
4:34 like- was so confused
The ONLY THING that happened post T-Pain are "rappers" started singing more! Also, Drake probably owes T-Pain money for that reason!
So a .. TOOL ruined an entire genre? Let's be honest, from the 80s on, it's not like the popular R&B was brimming with artistic creativity. Starting with the 80s, EVERYTHING within R&B and POP  is extremely derivative and driven by business and marketing. Only subgenres like Neo-soul had any creativity and unique production.
how much of a miserable person must you be to wake someone up to tell them their career ruined music...
I literally got an auto tune ad halfway through this video
my aunt had t pain as her GPS voice on road trips
Tpain seems so genuine like yo Usher you got famous for cheating music lmfao
ngl i don’t like the t-pain way of using autotune since i’m more into more soulful voices and slower emotional shit (i like raw vocals and shit) but he has good music i fuck with. i don’t think he has bad music or he ruined the industry! he was doing his thing and others liked it and tried copying and failed and those are the ones who “ruined music”. even then those ppl have fans too. music and art is all about taste!
Jacob Collier as an organism was literally created to produce musical ideas. Biologic perfect pitch, permanent hyperfixation. And guess what... He uses Melodyne... Because the human vocal chords cannot maintain perfect tune
First off. T-Pain can fucking sing.  Second off. T-Pain is a fucking lovely person
T-Pain is an amazing singer! His work is iconic and yes, he did indeed deserve to win the Masked Singer.  His reasoning for going on the show was that his PEERS got to use their platforms/voices and he just wanted the same chance. I say he proved his damn point, didn't he?   Sincerely,  A Half- White, Half-Cherokee 50 year old granny from the South   D'angelo, thank you for being what I am sure is a constant joy and a point of wonderful pride for your parents and siblings. You are a wonderful young man who constantly champions the underdog with facts and compassion. Keep doing you, boo-boo. Much love. ❤️
WOOWWW 02:11 MINS IN AND IM ALREADY HEART BROKEN FOR HIM :( THAT SIGH SAID IT ALL
Yall arguing and I'm trying to figure out which fka twigs video that was from
Also art is subjective saying "r&b declined after tpain" is like saying that art is dead because people use tablets to draw.   What some people might find horrible from one singer someone else might like. Not everyone liked t-pain for their own reasons I love T-pain his music is chill but for Usher to come out and say "yo my dude you ruined it" is just disgusting there are a dozen other artists you could've said that too at the time but you choose someone who simply uses auto tune to define his style. Just like usher has his style too
Last I checked t-pain still has a nice voice without auto-tune he just uses auto-tune cause it gives him the style he is known for. It's pretty much the reverse of Britney spears Britney forces her voice to change for that well known Britney sound
Usher 100% jealous that his best song was like 10 years ago at that point and here’s tpain trying something new and blowing up. If people didn’t like it he would’ve been the only one
Honestly watching your videos makes me more aware of what I put into the world and makes me want to be better. Also T-Pain = talent.
I hope T-Pain watched this video.
To be honest Usher's problem is with himself As an artist your job is to be versatile and experimental and it's not the fault of another artist that can do that when you refuse to change.
Remember when R&B actually stood for rhythm and blues..
There is an Indian artist called RITVIZ. He is not that famous but his songs are auto tuned and it's simply 😚🤌 GREAT!! WELL I like them 🙃...
"You fucked up music for actual singers" is a funny way of saying T-Pain gave opportunity to people who practiced with the technology
*T-pain without the T* 😔
I found it funny Usher said that when he uses autotune himself😂😂
Just graduated high school, EVERYONE STILL BOPS TPAIN. I’m sorry T-Pain music will be played as long as I am living
From the headline I thought Usher claimed T-Pain ruined music, sending the whole genre into a depression.
It’s obvious that he doesn’t sound like that. Saying that he’s ruining music and lying and stuff is like calling people who put on purple eyeshadow lying because they’re tricking them to believe that they have purple eyelids.
Vocaloid exists and people like it, that is straight up a computer singing
That ______ person doesn’t deserve what happened to him. Fill in the blank and you’ve got Twitter canceling someone.
As usual, D'Angelo Wallace, is able top skillfully take something, which is prevalent in popular culture, and then expertly dissect it from many angles. Give the subject the nuance and clarity it desperately needs. One of the things, D'Angelo clearly understands is that the world has a tendency for reductionism. It does always operate skillfully and does not accept all the facts when a particular narrative is better to just latch onto. A popular understanding of this is how net culture seems to "cancel" artists and people, who are clearly in the minority and are marginalised, more so than people who have a lot of socio-political power.  D'Angelo uses the word 'craft' and what I love is that he had the skills and craft to aggregate and archive useful information and present it in an intellectual and academic manner. Why is it that T-Pain is being cancelled? Is it really autotune?   Or, is this people's subtle racisms and discriminations coming out because a Black man and artist was able to, as usually is the case where the POC is excluded from movements they have created such as #MeToo, able to really change the way we experience and love music today. D'Angelo Wallace is right when he says that people need to sing good for autotune to actually have a better effect. A good example of this on the net is "Here Comes the Boy" a cat video, where someone's voice was shown to have a beautiful natural pitch, hence why adding music later only heightened the beauty of her voice. D'Angelo is able to skillfully excise out the fat of the topic. Showing us, how as a culture, we should use more of our logical rigour than just collapse on sentiment. To use emotion as a vital tool for survival and not some cheap addendum for thrills.
In the middle of this came an add for an auto tune app - kid you not😭✋🏾
Never released music? D'angelo we remember that diss track.
I legit teared up when he sang “Stay with Me” as the Monster. It was better than Sam Smith’s version. I said what I said.
It’s all the more hypocritical that Future didn’t want to work with him because of the whole auto-tune thing yet Future owes T-pain his whole auto-tuned career.
Auto tune is literally an instrument in modern music, pretty much everyone can access it, so its just how you use it really, nobody ruined anything
I hope get to meet t pain
The fact that i got an autotune ad on this video
Bestie, drop your playlist
TIL T-Pain has haters who are celebrities.
I will forever be grateful for this kind, warm and talented man T-Pain is.
damn i got an auto tune ad on a auto tune video
WHY T-PAIN?? JUST WHY T-PAIN OUT OF ALL PEOPLE????
wtf music labels put that stuff out and YALL choose to listen to it, don’t blame one man
You're right, I love t pain, guy literally doesn't make bad songs, I haven't heard any that I didn't love from him.
Interesting that you bring up acoustic guitar vs electric actually cause when electric guitars were getting popular and Bob Dylan came on stage people practically rioted because of it but the people rioted wanted him to keep doing folk and thought rock was gonna cause their kids to do drugs and have premarital sex or something so not exactly the same but similarly that animosity passed when people realized good music is good melic I believe.
lol the auto tune ad
Auto tune is an instrument to me. Just because you use auto tune doesn't mean you'll make good or even decent music. Making goo music with auto tune also takes a lot of talent.
T pain is super talented, awesome and non problematic. He’s an icon, who has so many bangers and seem to be a really genuine guy. He doesnt deserve the hate. He’s an artist in his own right. Amd he can actually sing for real
One super cool use of autotune is Future making really sad songs and autotuning his voice to the point where it sounds like he’s crying. Listen to songs like Xanax damage, hardly, or love thy enemies and you’ll see what I mean   It’s so fucking nice
I just got a autotune ad
I click on this video and I get an ad for autotune... very funny youtube
13:16 can anyone tell me what song this is? this is beautiful.
'canceling' is the most overused word on the internet
Commenting before I watch:  I don't like auto tune. It's not for the reason people say they don't. When t-pain broke out on the scene, me, my brother, my sister and all our friends fucking LOVED t-pain. The three of us hated eachother, but it's the one thing we had in common.     But that's the problem. I listened to so many of his hits as a young teen as they came out. T-pain is like kids music to me. I know its DEFINITELY not, but in my life it was. I liked T-pain at the same time I thought the Drake and Josh theme song was cool.      I dislike autotune, not because it's bad, but to me it sounds like music made to entertain kids to me. Now I listen to music with a much darker tone and some of the stuff I used to listen to. I just fell out of love with pop culture with age. Well, with the exception of things like post malone, Mac Miller and the weekend. I mostly listen to old-school rap, rock, a few miscellaneous genre's, some foreign music and DEAR GOD I CANT FUCKING STAND COUNTRY!!!!
Pitch corrected. Auto-tunin. Muted emotion-zero emotion❤️
Was aware of T-Pain and the auto time criticisms since the beginning, didn’t really pay much attention to him, heard his songs on the radio, whatever. Then I heard his Not My Job segment on Wait Wait and he was so chill and hilarious I was smitten. Def gonna check out his Tiny Desk concert now..
Thanks for standing up for right once again!  Don’t hate on me, but, T-Pain’s voice is far more pleasing than Ushers is.
What I love about T-Pain is that he actually doesn't need it at all, and he was just doing it for fun and because he enjoyed it.
14 day free trial of auto tune ad just played! Ha....
Autotune is a tool. Just like editing your music post-production. T-Pain knows how to use said tool and make it ORIGINAL, it is a STATEMENT within his music. He seems to be a really great guy and I don’t think he should listen to a ‘friend’ who’s most popular song is ‘Yeah’ repeated 50 times.
does anyone know the song by griff at around 13:10 😁
*clicks on to video about autotune *autotune software advertisement Me= seems about right
Does anyone know where that clip of Shamir singing is from?? Thats beautiful
Yass that Jacob Collier call out!
Even if T-Pain was directly responsible for the dEsTrUcTiOn oF mUsIc, how could he have forseen that when releasing that?? Like damn
Must be another Chanel that criticizes people for having ads in there videos on YouTube to make money. Because this guys online persona is far to nice to be that Chanel. Doesn’t line up.
Not me getting an autotune ad on this video-
Ironically Usher also uses auto-tune. Besides Auto-tune and Melodyne are just extra software that's used to polish music. No matter how well someone sings while recording, the audio engineer and mixer will always improve it.
Jacob collier does need to be arrested bc that man is perfect .
I’m glad I’m not the only EXTREMELY VOCAL T-Pain stan anymore
Usher sounds …dare I say it. Threatened
I guess we can put tpain on the same category of "celebrities society owes an apology to" for the out of proportion hate we all collectively threw at him
Usher acting like he’s a god of music when his last 2 albums was literally just him trying to copy future
I got an ad for an auto-tune program while watching this…
Tpain ruined music??? Are we forgetting that ushers contribution was justin bieber?
There’s someone copying you called nickisnotgreen
i agree with everything you said in this video except for pitch being the Least important part of singing... you can have all those other voice qualities you mentioned but if you ain't in key... 🙉🙉
i feel like i'm becoming smarter every second i watch one of your videos
T-Pain is immensely talented and is a real good human being.
So Usher doesn't ever use auto -tune? LOOOL
honestly my like is bc u said Jacob collier is talented to the point of being demonic. So true bestie
i want to know the fka twigs song so bad
Can we appreciate how the background complements the sweater?
12:41 this confused me lol All the examples shown for things "more important than having good pitch" were of people that are incredibly talented doing things that yes can't be fixed with auto tune but it sounds as good as it does because they already have good pitch to go with it, these people are basically the definition of a "good singer". I feel like you have to be able to sing at least a little bit for auto tune to be less noticeable, but bad pitch will make a good voice sound bad, at the very least incredibly amateur. You'd be impressed with Ariana Grande for those high notes and you'd still think she had a nice voice but if she was always off key I doubt you'd think she sounded good. Ya it's not the auto tuning that makes a voice sound "nice", but a nice voice can still be a bad singer. Idk what I'm arguing...pitch matters actually? Like pitch is the easiest to auto tune, so it doesn't necessarily require as much attention...unless you go live, because then maybe you can say it wasn't the auto tune that made their voice sound "nice" but it was the auto tune that made it sound "good"
I see he's repping the merch 😏
“Tpain ruined music with autotune.” Don’t blame him cause your career is failing.
People : cancelling people cos of autotune         Vocaloid fans and normal people : *screams in ghost unrully bloody murder til the lost ones weeping child isn't lost anymore and goes home to his mother with a television head just to find his house burned down* yes that was specific   Songs referenced :  Type in replies lol
Does usher even make music anymore ?  I hope tpain makes more music as well
Billie ellish literally used auto tune on her new song wtf????
I think the correct thing to say would have been “wow T-Pain, you have single handedly changed the game”, like it or not but he had a huge impact on the music industry, if so many people started using it after him how can you say it “ruined” the scene. Seems to me it just evolved and you personally didn’t like it, mr “and I said yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, etc”
hola tu acento de donde proviene
How is creating music that people actually listen to and like more than other music, "ruining music"? Just because people chose one thing over the other doesnt mean that anything was ruined, it just means people favoured one genre of music over old RB for a period of time - OOPS!  My preferred music is alternative, post hard dore, metal core, death core, and everything related to those  genres, but that's not the mainstream. The mainstream is pop artists and growing up I couldnt see why because I thought they were boring, but that doesnt mean I think they ruined music. Music genres have their trends and phases, like too bad so sad that old R&B had it's time and then declined for literally not that long during the t pain era. Those older artists are literal millionaires and want to complain because they're not the hot thing anymore? That's honestly extremely frustrating to hear millionaires complain about not getting their way anymore, everyone deserves a chance in the spotlight if they work for it and no one person can have it for too long thats just how things work. I'm sick of this whole jealousy train that celebrities ride and then convince fans to empathize with them. DONT YALL GET ENOUGH ATTENTION AND MONEY ALREADY? Like damn
usher had no right to criticize t-pain for "ruining music" when he brought a 12 yr old racist snot to fame into the weird racist adult he is now
Ushers just hating cause he's the old Chris Brown. And even Chris Brown sounds better than him, to some degree.
T pain invented his own lane and the industry hated him for it. It was such a new take on an old concept and they hated how much they needed him when it took off.
Bro u are laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
Lmao Dangelo probably got the worst name mess up by teachers.
Man, Usher is a bad friend.
T-Pain's tiny deal concert without autotune is so fucking good. Shit will make you appreciate him in a whole new way.
PLS PLS PLS PLS DO AN ABA & PREACH / FRESH & FIT VIDEO PLSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Much like how vocaloid shows, and like, literally what everyone is taught, the voice is an instrument and using technology to enhance it and create cool effects is great and i think more people should pull their heads out of their asses about how music and the arts should be utilised bc then no advancements would be made ever
I feel like people like to say "This genre has really been dry lately." when they're the ones incapable of finding good stuff, you see it with all sorts of music, tv shows, animes, and movies.
Coming from an audio engineer turned writer/artist: THANK YOU! Great take.
T Pain is a legend, I love him and his music so much!
So did Usher tell Zapp and Roger this?! T-Pain was really just building on their legacy. It's so dumb blaming T-Pain instead of greedy record execs who just see something popular and immediately want to clone it without understanding it, effing everything up in the process.
AGREE 100 PERCENT
LEAVE T PAIN ALONE
“Ive never released music” **throwback to the woohoo disstrack**
And on top of everything he seems so sweet
We all know t pain didn’t f up music
Cher used an Vocoder
I was shocked how amazing willow smith's new music is. I was like "THE WHIP MY HAIR BACK AND FORTH GIRL, NO WAY!"
I watched T-pains interview on Steve-so's podcast and he seems like a super cool guy.
T-Pain can sing with or without autotune! Usher takes hits at all singers he finds as threats. First, The Weeknd, now this?! What a joke.
You’re right, the second I read about what Usher said to T-Pain made me immediately think of his last big hit, OMG. Usher is such a hypocrite.
Because of this video I miss some T-pain 💕
i really hate people saying "music today is trash 🤬" but they only listen to top 100 music. theres nothing wrong with liking that stuff but dont judge people who like new music just because you have never taken the time to try and look for music.
I mean, of course... it hits different when it is a friend that of course you love and is special... that was... cruel for me. Every song has a little bit of auto-tune.
I got an ad for autotune on this video
not me getting an autotune AD the whole time
what mic and cam u use bro ?
I'll listen to t pain over usher anyday. He mad some good songs and really changed the genre
I absolutely hate Usher, on a personal level. I have stories about my interactions with that deplorable man, that spanned years.
at this point D they are definitely hating on Pain he’s literally one of my favs from the early 2000s  and Usher was pretty much hating on his popularity in my opinion
Who the fuck listens to T-Pain and thinks “wow that’s his real voice all the ‘real singers’ gotta keep up with him now, he’s cheating” Get real lmao also there’s a reason it’s called ‘playing’ music not ‘winning’ it. damn i didn’t think this video would piss me off but seeing T-Pain talk about it broke my heart
Whattttt?!  Ummmm.  I guess a lot of people haven't heard Zapp & Roger?!  That's all they use, lol!
ANYONE CANCELLING TPAIN FOR USING AUTOTUNE IS JUST PROVING HOW YOUNG THEY ARE AND THAT THEY NEED TO LITERALLY STFU. THATS BEEN TPAIN’S THING SINCE DAY 1
4:34 Who is “Mi Sagos ?”
I’m not a t pain fan but he definitely doesn’t deserve this hate cause literally almost all artists use auto tune, HAVE YOU HEARD ADDISON REAS SONG??
T pain is Jesus change my mindddddddddd
whereeee you at though babe I miss you?
if you go in and watch the full episode of "This is Pop" you see he wasn't the first one to use auto-tune, many popular singers before him used it. so if anyone ruined R&B it wasn't T-pain
Crazy thing is that he sounds the same without it. Just non reverberated, if anyone actually knew anything about music you'd know that this is on the level of the guitar section of the song living on a prayer.
I got an add for auto tune
T-pain's auto tune just brings nostalgia and I love it
D'Angelo knows Jacob Collier?! Ayyyye.
We have autotune for tiny perfections We have autotune for artistic purposes  and then we have hypocrites
It’s the willow shoutout for me
The thing is he can sing without auto-tune. His Tiny Desk episode was EPIC and one of my favorites!
I kinda have a crush on T-pain 😳
i find it very funny that youtube chose to give me an autotune ad on this video of all videos
OKAY ALSO THE IRONY OF THAT COMING FROM USHER OF ALL PEOPLE 😒
Edit: I should’ve finished watching the video before commenting. I just realize I literally just comment everything he was already going to say. 😅😂  I’m trying understand this like?? the particular style of over the top autotune effect T Pain was using was extremely reminiscent of a vocoder which was invent IN THE 30s. It’s not like anyone was listening to T Pain thinking “gee I bet his voice actually sounds like a robot naturally” (idk maybe really little kids did?), so Island where people get off acting like he was “lying” or something. That’s like accusing someone using a particular effect on their guitar of lying about how their guitar actually sounds. Not to mention the fact that auto tune far pre-dates T Pain. Like Cher was the first artist to admit to using autotune way before all this so idk why people are trying to ‘hold him responsible’ for it anyway. Utter nonsense.
The episode said that auto tune was a held industry tool, that was hidden for decades and TPain utilized the tool, at the time, as a way to stand out and do something new. 🙄 He actually is a really talented singer.
Usher is like Sasuke for tpain, but usher remains as an asshole for the whole arc till the end
how people going to get mad at music for evolving omfg
people forget that tpain is an insanely talented acoustic singer. literally watch 1 video of him singing
Yo D'Angelo did you really just change my mind about T-Pain. I judged him and believed Usher. I'm excited to go back and explore T-Pain again with this new positive perspective. Cheers bala no cap
I think T-Pain should get an actual talk box, not only would that make it way cooler but it would also help him lose the flack.
To help his analogy it’s kinda like saying that punk rock ruined rock music because it made people stop trying.
oof. i'm trippin so bad i thought he was advertising an edible. damn that energy bar looks good rn.
Honestly I love the way autotune sounds. I love how digital and futuristic it sounds. That’s why I like artists like Bladee, Kanye, Travis Scott (only sometimes though tbh),  Smokepurpp (god Past The Moon and Red Bottoms are amazing), and the subject of this video, T-Pain. It’s also why I love hyperpop music.
I literally got an ad for Auto-Tune Limited under this video. I have never seen an ad for Auto-Tune ever before this.
I love him! He features in one of my favorite songs by 6lack.
i cant see your all caps channel.
Not me getting an Auto-Tune Unlimited ad in the middle of this video…
sorry dangelo, i dont like my soundwaves specifically altered to a tone that would not be produced by a normal vocal chord.
The shade oop! 😆
Alright guys, no tpain, no 808s and heartbreak, therefore, half of modern rap would not be the same
Im gonna make a tpain tiktok today hah
Usher saying autotune ruined music  yet he’s got multiple songs with Future and Young Thug who both got famous ripping off T-Pain’s whole style lmao
Please God someone tell me who that was for his clarity example at 13:21
How y'all gonna cancel someone for using auto-tune when literally half of the entire music industry uses auto-tune in some form now?
It's not fair to hate the original, just for hating all of the copycats...
T-Pain has a beautiful voice. Mans can sing with or without auto tune
Unpopular opinion here.  Auto tune is bad
it really just depends on opinion. you like it? cool. you dont like it? cool. argument over
" I brought us Drinks to Drink, We Drunk 'um got Drunk!".... Don't play with T-Pain!!!!
i got a auto tune Ad before the video 🥺
i will say……. adam levine’s vocals are fine (songs about jane was the best maroon 5 album though, still slaps) in recorded tracks, but live is like… terrible lmfao
THANK YOU for making that point about people saying music is being ruined by (insert reason here) when a lot of the time folks don’t even make the effort to look for good music outside of being spoon fed this weeks top 10.
The fact usher asked the flight attendant to wake him up and tell him to come over just to put him down, Is terrible
I don't really care for r&b (I listen to musical soundtracks mostly) but blaming one person (who is your friend!) for the 'fall of it' is a shithole move. Get over yourself Usher.
T-Pain is literally so great... he's like a teddy bear???  And Usher is... Usher.
What usher meant is that train messed up music for usher.. cause he couldn’t come with any bangers.
i got an ad for autotune software while watching this
I really had to come back to this video to be reminded of the plug in to fix voice pitches.
T-pain made music for fun to listen to. He made it fun to listen to instead of it being plain old regular music he just made it fun!
That’s like saying the person who popularized paint ruined art. Bruh
13:49 omg thank you D’Angelo for featuring these two small artists, they deserve everything 🥺🥺
when people say Y'all
T-pain seems so nice and genuine.
I got an add for auto tune while watching this. Even YouTube disagrees with Usher 💀
4:28 PREACH BRO
_"Usher has the Audacity of saying that when he released BIEBER to the world?!"_  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i have to disagree with usher 💯t-pain is still LIT and t-pain is still 🔥🔥🔥,i love t-pain music & song. T-pain didn't ruin r&b music. Usher did. Usher ruin it with his singing. Especially what he said to t-pain.
T-Pain was great on the Gus and Eddy podcast and also I need him as a Disney prince yesterday
So let me get this straight D'Angelo  has problem of some BTS songs in  auto tunes but not T-Pain the master of auto tunes this is hypocrite laughable  to me, this guy got problem of artist singing auto tunes but T-Pain gets a pass because He's a legend...😂
It's pretty bizarre that any "real singer" would think that they were serously in competition with T-Pain-style autotune.  And that's no disrespect to T-Pain at all.  Using autotune as an overt creative element is completely different from using it to "cheat" at singing.  Did Usher think the audience couldn't tell the difference?  It's weird, people have always caught flack for expanding the range of musical sound, but... usually it's when they *start* doing it, not several years later when it's obvious that it didn't actually ruin music.
Tpain as a Disney prince please?
Also don’t forget, T-pain plays keys like nobody’s business
but usher USES auto tune.. i’m very confused
Do people not get how those kind of production techniques do take skill. Just because an artists skill is different to some people’s those people think they’re better
I usually feel pretty self conscious about this... but people tell me my natural voice sounds like auto tune because of the pitch, and because I have a falsetto (that I'm trying and failing to get rid of), so I was kinda hesitant to watch this, but I don't think one person can ruin music just for using auto tune if auto tune is used in many songs already. (Just me letting out my feelings I guess lol ) 😅
Ah, so we're cancelling people for singing auto tune when there is a celeb out there who admitted to drugging and robbing people? Ok
7:56 that was my comment 😎❤️
i ctfu at "two random small artists idk" 💀💀💀
I thought T-Pain's autotuney voice made his music uniquely fun. Usher is a cut-throat womaniser. His music is less revolutionary than original R&B artists. T-Pain got woken up to get stupidly dissed by the has-been Usher.
He can sing without auto tune he just chooses not to his style is based on using a lot of auto tune
Autotune is trash and he didn't popularize it.
Cancel culture is more idiotic than Trisha paytas eating chic fil a fries
Ahhh, so this is what hypocrisy looks like 😲😲😲
How is this a thing again? I thought the AutoTune Wars ended a decade ago...
Look up his tiny desk concert. This man has a voice of a god damn angel
auto tune is not singing . anyone , even you can sing and use auto tune
T pain is awesome. I try to catch all his twitch live streams 🔥
can someone plsss tell me the name of the song shamir is singing i've been looking for it for weeks
T-pain is a genius because he found a sound that no one else had, made a shit ton of money and used his OWN creativity and songwriting in producing. And literally made all the bops of my high school and middle school days.
Y tf do I keep getting recommended this niggas videos. I already clicked the “don’t get recommendations from this channel.” But I keep getting them 😐
So, let me get this straight, you pretty much dissed BTS for using autotune in their recent track (that wasn't even their own doing), but you're hyping up T-Pain for using autotune. So confused.
excuse me, but t-pain literally defined my childhood with his part in Best Love Song. i gave no fucks about chris, only t-pain
RIP to Roger Zapp💜💛👑 Computer Love, I Wanna Be Your Man so good.
T pain was cool , liked his music ,  the auto tune sound was cool , it was effective and it worked.. usher was bitter as fck,  music is all about evolving , changing,  music is not just about the voice talent.. if the masses love it then it's music and popular , U cannot progress without change ... anyway , dude , deangelo  u go out of your way to rip bts for auto tune that your unqualified ears tend to hear and claim it's so bad and all that crazy shit , U claim your criticism of bts is not based on some personal issue u have regarding the Asian group and it's just an opinion that generally seem to  border on racism and xenophobia but now it's confirmed that u have a gripe with bts that has nothing to do with their music , it's about the guys , their race , their nationality and their aesthetics .. U  CLEARLY not well versed in music and production , what u saying is easy to Google but u defending t pain for his excessive auto tune but u hate on bts big time for any little bit of auto tune that is used for effect.. DUDE that is crazy AF .. in one video u all for it and another video u crucify a group , u call t pain a real singer and yeah I love his voice .. lol masked singer,  Asian creation .. do u even realise u are like fox news hosts , U contradict yourself repeatedly,  dude,  you can debate yourself , IM going to arrange a clip by clip contradiction of yours .. lmfu hilarious
I do hate obvious auto tuned singing, I don't like the way it sounds, but OBVIOUSLY music isn't ruined because auto tune has been so trendy, that's a silly stance. I think you could argue that it's sad that a lot of top songs are very shallow and heavily feature auto tune, but that's a tiny sliver of music that's available.
I have to say, I despise Auto Tune. It always seems like people who aren't as skilled at singing use it and some people who can sing ruin songs by using it. Better to train the voice than engineer it. I've seen live footage of songs that made me think, "WTH is wrong with their voice? It's like they've suddenly forgotten how to vocalize properly." That kind of experience would make me less likely to buy tickets for live concerts.
Also can we just mention how perfect Woods by Bon Iver and Love Lockdown by Kanye West is? Two songs very much enhanced by autotune.
T-pain made the line "I'm in love with a stripper" beautiful. I don't know anyone else who can do that
13:00 I appreciate you for sharing all this. Lovely video.
Usher was just mad because he stopped relevant a long time ago
i got a auto tune ad
bruh when u showed Chloe I was like "she's literally her own species at this point. we got humans, animals, plants, and Chloe Bailey"
Please keep doing what makes you happy! I love these videos and we all love seeing you happy!
T-Pain doesn't sing with autotune when he streams on Twitch and he sounds awesome. Also, TEDDY RILEY from Blackstreet overused autotune, no one came for him. Or the dude who sings Computer Love, where's his drama. Ppl need to sit there fuck down and shut the fuck up sometimes, Jesus Holy Christ almighty!
If Tpain didn’t popularize auto-tune, then someone else would have eventually . Atleast Tpain is actually a talented singer, writer, producer, and all around musician/artists that the level he popularized it was actually of quality and enjoyable. He can’t control how others use it after him. Usher’s statement was too blanketed against him.
T-Pain is my FAVORITE PERSON EVER! That man is the greatest in every way! EVERY WAY! One more time E V E R Y W A Y! HE DOESNT DESERVE ANY OF THIS SHIT! I LOVE T-PAIN!
T pain actually had vocal ability tho
Oh my Angelic Gift of a man, we could all tell you're not a coffee person when you said EXPRESSO.
This Usher guy sounds like every single high school bully ever.
I hope he sees this king (not sarcasm)
Milli Vanilli ruined music, and we can all blame that on the rain.
Shouldn't Usher worry about oh, I dunno not giving people the clap?
Usher made a whole song called "Oh My God" with autotune sounds. And it did not nearly sound as good as anything T-Pain put out.
I mean... you yourself have bashed artists for using autotune?? So what is it?
Sideways has this video I really like called "my problem with autotune", he does go through a lot of the same points
T-Pain's autotune game CHANGED music. He mastered it, made it his identity and created so many of my all-time favorite "throwbacks".  Driving, hanging with friends, cleaning, drinking... It's just iconic. Usher is just mad 💁 leave my sweet baby alone
T-PAIN NEEDS A HUG 🥺🌷💐
I mean... plugging a guitar into an amp is kinda correcting it. Any effects you add is imitating some sort of technique. Tosin Abasin perfected the intense echo effect (look at An Infinite Regression) without using the amp. Reverb derives from playing in large halls. Chorus effect explains itself. If the only thing that can’t be imitated is the strumming then isn’t that exactly the same as breathing out with your vocal chords tensed up?
What usher meant to say is "you made something else more popular than my music is at the moment and I'm mad about it"
HDHDFSGJGS USHER SAYING TPAIN RUINED MUSIC
he makes a point that his albums have 1-3 songs with no autotune
People really be out here acting like Daniel Caesar and Anderson .Paak aren't F L O U R I S H I N G rn I--
You defend auto tune here but cry about auto tune in permission to dance and use it to mock BTS' english. A whole clown.
I like T Pain. The fact that Usher said this to his friend that affected him the way it did  is sad and disappointing 😕
Next episode of twitter being super dumb:  *Twitter cancels Taylor Swift for using guitar sounds in her music because its offensive to people who can't play the guitar*
hypocrite
And yet when bts uses minimal autotune all hell break loose.
U defend Tpain for using Auto tune and Slam BTS for using auto tune?  Hmmm interesting....
The fact that I got a auto tune related ad before this💀
And you made a video just today complaining about autotune. Hypocrital don't ya think? Donu hate ptd or is it because its BTS?
bats eyelashes blank stare
I used to dislike T-Pain music because of the auto tune, but you have given me new respect for what he does. And I loved hearing his voice without auto tune. He is an amazing artist that I regret missing out on for so long.
Go follow TPAIN on twitch, y'all. Gotta show support for our heavenly king
Usher is trash. He got mad at Justin Timberlake emulating his down style while he was emulating Micheal Jackson’s.
I can imagine how Ushers opinion would mean alot but its still a persons opinion. If a random troll commented that on T-pains twitter or whatever he wouldnt care. What Im saying is he shouldnt blame usher for his ‘4 yr depression’. I dont agree with Usher and he has deffo used pitch correction/ auto tune before. Highly auto-tuned songs is kind of its own style and genre theres still a place for less edited tunes.
Okay but can we talk abt this … like how tf she do that 😩😭 13:51
Has anyone ever told you, you look like lil tecca???
The gentle reminder that T-pain chooses to let us live free from his mind control was really sweet and immediately made me go… listen to T-pai- HEY! …
It reminds me of when Zapp and Roger created the electro robotic voice and till this day I still love hearing that.
"Two random small artists idk" 😂😂😂
If anyone wants to learn more about autotune and pitch correction should check out sideways youtube video on it. but d'angelo explained it really good!
As much as i dislike autotune t pain never really made music garbage, its the money hungry figures in the industry. T pain is a real guy.
so i’m wondering if that silicone promise ring is on the left or right hand ?👀
No but D'Angelo getting excited and happy about things is so fun to watch, this man has such a contagious energy he needs to be under quarantine.
But he can really sing
the jacob collier clip gave me CHILLS i love him
Autotune is like makeup, but for your voice. Sometimes it makes it worse, other times it's subtle enough to seem natural, and most of the time, it's just pretty
What do they mean auto-tune ruined music?  Hell, even Kanye West used it, Bo Burnham used it in his special. Usher can stfu.
I think it's funny that you said roger and zapp instead of zapp and roger. I'm gonna call them that and make my dad mad.
I have to ask what is the meaning of white ring on ur left finger
as a bts fan, i cant even understand a whole situation lmaoooo😭😭💀💀 how can u cancelling someone over autotune? bruh i bet if yall listen to bts' bsides yall gonna cancelling them too, let me tell u bts used a bunch of autotune especially for their rap songs and i didnt even had a problem with that cuz they sound so good live and as long as the song is good its all fine. they even used a lot of autotune in their tittle tracks too👩‍🦯👩‍🦯 ppl need to chill fr. leave that poor man alone pls
The problem with deangelo is his he supports Shannon aka creep show art. He hasn’t come out and said anything about it, he’s clearly on her side. Being silent says more than he thinks. Don’t support this guy bc he supports CPA
12:21 omg transparent soul is my life rn and willow is my celeb crush
Usher should be the last person to talking about ruining music... 😒
Please do gabbie Hanna 💕
Heeeey wait a minute.....I think I know those guys.       That's the Weekend and Ariana Grand, right?
00:30 brought back aaalll the memories 💃💃
Very dry and predictable sense of humour. Hard to watch
Didn't u complain abt bts' use of autotune?? :0
Also anther point. EVERYBODY USES AUTOTUNE OR MELODYNE your favourite artist uses it.
Anybody who knows T knows this dude can sing and rap which is more than usher can say. Pain also writes his own music and produces. I’ve lost a lot of respect for usher
The camera clarity, casual and natural lighting look, color pairing, background setting, clear skin etc. And the video is focused on supporting T-Pain too! Wow just wow
Currently, people are hating on the new Billie Eilish single because of the “too much autotune.”  I think it sounds cool. To each their own. But for some reason, I’m only finding these opinions on tiktok...yk, the best app for kids and adults to share valuable and valid opinions !
I only know T Pain from the masked singer, but even then he had a beautiful voice. Auto tune or not, he’s a talented guy. Do people not realize how many other famous artists use auto tune? T Pain revolutionized auto tune and made it his own thing, creating a unique sound that you could recognize. (I’m only halfway through the video so sorry if some of my information is wrong lol)
Ooooooo can you do Oliver kneehouse? He deserves to be analyzed for sure!!
Just A Joke Read Below To See More         I Love Black People Like I Love Chocolate LMFAO 😂😂😂😂
im conviced that people who complain about autotune have no idea about music and just mimic what other idiots say. It feels like these people think that autotune is just some random button that makes horrible vocals sound amazing.
I love that one of the ads for this video was for auto tune
There are people with gorgeous voices who use auto tune: it’s about style not technical talent.
I love that I got a commercial for auto tuning
I would rather listen to an over autotuned song than one that's not have u heard Gabbie and Danielle Cohn. My ears are bleeding 😫
Nice job, per ushe, D'Angelo. Ttly blown away by that story. I've always thought T Pain was a genius, honestly: singer, songwriter, producer, innovator. Like you said, his ability to write a hook plus the melodic, upbeat, "gotta dance," feel-good vibe of his songs over the years is undeniable. To this day I still keep songs like I'm Sprung, Bartender, I'm in Love with a Stripper, & Buy you a Drink in rotation. The other important thing is this: TPain's songs make people happy. Not long ago I was watching a couple of his videos from above songs & started reading the comments. THOUSANDS of comments were from people citing amazing, happy, memorable moments in their lives - high-school, parties, dancing, etc - with TPain's songs at the center of the moment. They remember the song, thus the memory is triggered. That's huge, actually. That's the gift of music. I'm sorry TPain ever doubted himself. He didn't have to say it but I will. F**k you, Usher.
why does anyone at all watch this guy's videos? he makes vids bashing the same shit he does lmao. calling out cancel culture yet the majority of his videos contribute to cancel culture.   he's a full on hypocrite with a bunch of bot followers. next.
Can you please share your thoughts on Trisha Paytas and how dangerous she is? I feel like everyone has just forgotten everything that has come to light recently and would love to hear your take on her
You should watch Khadija Mbowe video on Cuties. She mentions your video. I think she brings up some very valid points.
At least T-Pain is known for auto tune and not giving strippers fake money  ☕ Usher needs to sit down.
Please do a 2 hour long video on Gabbie Hanna
Because T- Pain needs you to stand up for him. This kind of video is childish. You have changed nothing.
yes stan willow
If you don't like songs with auto-tune, then don't listen to songs with auto-tune. Ya don't have to cancel someone cuz ya don't like their music. Then again I am someone who opposed cancel culture, so yeah...
does that mean do you believe in life after love is canceled, im physically fighting people
T-Pain music is absolute trash, but he only exists because he has an audience. If the trend was not successful it would cease to exist.
I just have to say this...you have ruined me. After watching a couple of your videos with your smooth editing & rigorous fact check...I find myself baffled when watching other reviews on previous channels that I used to frequent. I found major red flags in the other video that is inexcusable especially when the YouTuber is spouting misinformation. I can't help but compare & I also find your honesty in correcting misinformation on your channel very commendable. Keep it up!
Damn Usher do better. Got to bash an artist who was your friend, at their craft, just because they are successful for it. Sounds like jealousy to me.
Are they serious? So we just canceling anybody now. T-pain can sing so good without auto tune. He proved it on the mask singer. A lot of artist use auto tune. Although I prefer him being is authentic self whatever makes his career better is good for him.  I have no idea why this is a thing now. Like how bored do you have to be to cancel someone for no legitimate reason.  People need to get a life fr.
T-Pain is a fan of Gus and Eddy which means he is a good guy you can't disagree
Damn, the art community has really gone downhill as a whole ever since the color orange was invented 🙄
It's like saying digital art is not "real" art .... all digital artists start as traditional artists and just because an art is digital doesn't mean it's good or bad automatically .. it all depends on the artist. It just so happens that Tpain is good in both aspects but just happen to favor auto-tune, which doesn't make him bad  or worse whatsoever. What I gathered from this is Usher is an unsupportive friend who was probably jealous
i did not just get an ad for auto-tune on this video 💀
that willow smith comment did age well
PLSSS make a new review on BTS new album BE🙏🙏🙏🙏 together with dynamite, butter and permission to dance
The evolution of auto-tune would've been where it is today with or without T Pain eventually...
Can you do a video about neopronouns? I'd love to hear your take.
D’angelo just wanted to show us that he has good taste in music and I’m not mad at that
you cant tell me Usher hasn't ever heard of Peter Frampton...
I just love the things D'Angelo announces in his video, but I'm not from the States so I cant buy pr subscribe to any to those 🤧
I like how relaxing ur voice is even though ur talking about the the things that maters In our lives so thank u very much
Fuck usher.
Train also can sing incredibly well WITHOUT autotune, something a lot of people forget
I’m addicted to your channel! Thank you for continuing to share quality content❤️
Zapp & Roger, the originators of auto-tune. If Twitter wants to cancel T-Pain, then they can't ever listen to "Computer Love" again. I said what I said.  *Edit: Forgot about Peter Frampton. That cat loved him some auto-tune, and his classic rock hits slap.
Y'ever been so mad you tried to cancel someone cuz you're unskilled at what the other person is ? Me neither ...
Guys, don’t let this distract you from the D’angelo’s new empire in the making, it’s happening slowly, but once you notice it’ll be too late.
if autotune fixed bad performances then Rebecca black's Friday would be amazing
dangelo, you have a b+ on social blade. just thought you should know
I'm so glad someone's talking about this because t-pain literally does not deserve this slander
Shamir is the only one I don’t knows thank you!
Twitter is the most toxic app.
Well USHER! I can think of a few things we should cancel you for! Should I say what "THEY" are?
As Miss Swift said... "I wanna be defined by the things that I love Not the things I hate"
Can you PLEASSEEE pick apart Anna Campbell and Natalia Taylor I just need you to see the shit that’s going down
I've just seen the first few pictures of T pain without glasses and he looks so fucking cute with those big eyes like idk but he looks like a baby or sum. cute guy
Autotune is like digital movie effects. Most times you see/hear it you won't even notice it's there. But you can get really cool effects when you make it more obvious on purpose and turn it into an effect. Nothing wrong with it lmao
Can usher please worry about his flaming genitals and the fact he didn't disclose he had herpes to some of his sexual partners and stop coming for our auto tune lord and savior tpain
"Hatin' is a disease, Usher Raymond, stop it" I had wondered why _The Game_ said that in 'AI With The Braids', this helps to explain it! LOL
Needful, kind and true. Anything you say needs to be at least 2 out of those 3 things. If it isn't: keep it to yourself.
But Usher could never sing. Why is he even in this argument? IF he was talented, he could maybe speak. Folks in glass houses should not throw stones. Also the Auto Tune sound was popular BEFORE T Pain.They (Teddy Riley for example) used the Talk Box. With T Pain it is obvious he is using it at least. Maybe it would have been better if he was using it and pretending he can sing (like Usher and almost every other singer).
I think he brought autotune Out
Address the creep show art
I'm just cancelling T-Pain 🤷🏾‍♂️
ANDDD his opening song for twitch is absolute fire.
d’angelo not willow smith she’s being very disrespectful to peoples religion and their community
Jason Derulo do ruin music
Wallace: two random small artists  Also Wallace: shows ariana grande and the weekend
W
A thing that doesn't get mentioned often is that because of artists like T-Pain we now have auto-tune being used as a form of artistic expression rather than pitch correction... Think of hyperpop artists like Charli XCX and 100 gecs, even they wouldn't be here without T-Pain
I know you know the vibe. Shame on Harry Styles! Spread the word.
I could delete every streaming service I have, because dangelo’s content is free and better lol
I know this comment will be deleted, but oh well, may as well get this shot out on the vague chance you see it. You cancelled a kid for being edgy, 3 years ago, ya lummox.
And I’m not caping for Usher here but I’m a man of fairness lol   Y’all are acting like Usher said “GO WAKE THAT BITCH ASS MF UP” like that stewardess couldn’t have been the one to do that on her own. Like if you weren’t on the plane… just worry about commenting on Usher’s comments and not some shit you’re fabricating just to further validate your dislike of Usher lol  And I bet a good number of y’all have bumped “Come Thru” by Summer Walker at some point in time since it came out 😂  anyway usher had a valid point but it had absolutely nothing to do with t-pain. Yes art is subjective so there’s no “real” singing (although… there kinda is but that’s different story) and there’s a plethora of it out there to explore so you can get YOUR fix if you feel you’re not getting it from the mainstream but I’m assuming (and pretty sure) usher was talking mainstream music industry here.
Can I just take this time to say that Usher sampling a lick from “Superstitious” by Stevie Wonder for his song “Little Freak” is still one of my favorite things ever.  Also a lot of y’all are sitting in these comments talking about not trashing an artist blah blah blah and turning RIGHT around and slinging Usher through the mud lol girl wut
1.) Jazmine Sullivan is classic R&B? Shit, am I old? When I think classic R&B I think Aretha, The Isley Brothers, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, The Spinners, Teena Marie, EWF, The Whispers, The Temptations, The Supremes, Patti Labelle, New Edition, Minnie Ripperton, Chaka Khan, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, The Jackson 5, is Mary J Blige, SWV, Brandy, Monica, Keith Sweat, Boyz II Men, D’Angelo, Raphael Saadiq, Maxwell, Dwele, Sade, Donnell Jones, Carl Thomas, 112, Jagged Edge… I could go on and on. The point is Jazmine will be classic when she reaches at least 20 years from her first big hit single.  2.) Usher may have expressed his point in a hyperbolic manner that skewed what he really meant (do you REALLY think he singularly blames T-Pain for fucking up ALL of music? Come on now) but we will NOT tolerate any slander of that man’s skill, catalog, or the impact of his career. The man has rightfully earned his spot as one of the icons of R&B.  3.) I definitely get what Usher is saying. Traditional power vocalists have stiffer competition in the industry because people with lesser vocal ability are able to use things like autotune. I acknowledge that as a reality, but it doesn’t mean T-Pain ruined music for “real” singers. That’s impossible. People use auto tune to try and mimic what “real” singers do. Pain’s use of autotune was and is outstandingly exemplary because he combined advanced vocal skill with new age technology. It just became another tired trend exploited by the industry. Usher is a vocal purist (like many singers out there) who see the artificial enhancement of autotune disparagingly. Autotune doesn’t invalidate their skill tho, and they could use it and start a new wave of highly skilled vocalists that use autotune to further enhance their skills and express them through an atypical lens for someone in their particular field of music performance. I think Usher’s critique, tho worded incorrectly, is valid. If I do a run, and someone else who can’t sing as well as me goes into a booth and uses autotune to successfully sing the same run I just sang, I now have competition from a lesser skilled singer I normally wouldn’t have. It’s like analog and digital clocks. At the end of the day, they both still tell time.
Wonder if these people would be willing to listen to music from the 50s and earlier if edits to the pitch of a singer is offensive to them.
yes willow smith shout out :,)
Now, I've got to go listen to every song ever by T-Pain... I am in need 😩😩
If it wasn't for this beautiful man, we would never be able to hate on everyone we hate on today! He is our king!
I hate that “auto tune” sound but telling this dude he “ruined music” for it is the dumbest shit ever. People liked his music, so he kept making music. Not his fault people wanted in on his success lol
T-Pain and Kehlani's collab was everything. I don't get it.
Thanks for making this video D'Angelo! Poor T Pain he didn't deserve this. He used a tool in a creative way and made great music I still enjoy to this day. His voice is beautiful and he's more relevant and talented than Usher.
I’m sorry but can you talk about Idubbdz being a racist, like the fact that he uses racial slurs to be funny is fucking weird.
Poor T-Pain, he was just using auto tune in a unique way for his art. He definitely doesn't deserve this
The Woke are a cult they have to eventually destroy everything good- first the targeting is easy; old white men dr Seuss and Ellen- then it becomes more obscure like terry cruise but really anything creative is bad soon you’re going to say the wrong thing and it’s you!
As long as the heavy auto tune sounds good, it’s fine. Music is an art and each artist should be able to express their own work in their own way.
People act like autotune is not using in any song, T Pain just take the concept of distortion and use that in his artistic way, even I don't like, I think it's brilliant
I got literal shivers at 17:40 he’s amazing
Farrah Abraham is a perfect example of how autotune does not create talent where there is none. no offense to her, i love the album she put out but it's no secret that she had no idea how to sing, even her producer said so lol
is it just me or is it what i see some kind of merch? either way i want some
Tbh R&B really hasn’t been the same since the early 2000s though. Definitely not “thriving”. T-pain is also definitely not at all responsible for this. I’d say the industry’s just grown in really corrupt and ugly ways. R&B isn’t produced the same way it used to be, it don’t sound or feel the same either
That 0.00001 sec of Dixie☠️
You need a better mic too my friend
Can you school me in today’s history???
you think you could do a video on the creepshow art drama? id love to see your opinion on it, and im sure it would get you lots of money lmao
In all seriousness, where would music be today without tpain??
YAS QUEEF SLAY QUEEEEEEEEF! I LOVE ME SOME DANG ELO WALLACE.  I. LOVE. ME. SOME. DANG. ELO!!!
Not a fan of Willow Smiths new music at all.
Yeah T-Pain ruined music totally. And that’s why I know more songs by T-Pain than I do by Usher. Because T-Pain is such a bad music artist and has bad vocals and music that I know of him more than Usher.
THANK YOU  FINALLY SOMEBODY SAYS MASEGO sometimes I wondered if he was real and I was dreaming Also y'all should check out xavier omar
Twitter :Cancel a rapper that used autotune  But listens to horrible SoundCloud music
Usher’s such a baby. Trends in music happen. If people like a certain thing they’re gonna wanna do it lol. T-Pain used Autotune as a stylistic choice in his music and people enjoyed it a lot so they got inspired which is why we have artists using this same sound now.  Although I can agree some people use auto tune to mask the fact that they’re not a very strong vocalist, that isn’t even the case with many people. T-Pain is actually a very talented singer so making that jab towards him was not only dumb but also rude af
no one ruins music. music just simply evolves due to new generations lmao
T-pain has a feature in one of Jacob Collier’s song… meanwhile usher has a ruined reputation.
Like.... I kind of hated autotune and stuff but like... Feels kind of gatekeeperie to say the only talent has to be natural.  Synthetically altered music is okay. It's used a lot. I bet they run a de-esser over Usher.
We love tpain here
I would cancel you in a blink of the eye over this hat dude...
all the tea and memes aside ive been lonely lately, And your videos have been keeping me from depression for months now. Ive had shit happen to me and ive been sad lately and your videos have been making me crack up man. Your videos has been keeping me from depression. Thank you so much for being there on this platform making videos and making me happy again. I hope you keep thriving. :)
Usher's got a lot of nerve with his STD having & passing, fake counterfeit money with his face having @$$! That was a Narc move on Usher's part.
Cher will always slap~
Computer love is like 3 decades ahead of current autotune music.. js
Usher: You f*ed up music, bro.   Me: T-Pain made my favorite artists a thing, bro.
If T-pain is up for cancellation over autotune... I demand that 100gecs be exiled to China lol
lmao the flop who pays working dancers with "Ush Bucks" instead of actual US tender really thinks he's something for saying "yeah"??? Usher only wishes he had the cultural impact of T-pain. T-pain has more talent in his pinky nail than Usher does in his entire existence. What a joke
Lmao usher 🤡
People: *Cancle T Pain because he used autotune* BTS: *Nervous sweating*
If we’re all being honest, if T Pain didn’t “start it” someone else would’ve. It’s messed up and uncalled for to put that burden of “you ruined music” on someone.
Well, I am a Classic Rock supporter and I could see how a person could say autotune ruined "real music." Some people don't realize or do but don't really care, about the programmed instruments, using computers in music. I could relate why T-Pain was so upset in the video but seriously a four year depression, because of some autotune this is nuts.
Bro you should really talk about music more. Made a fan of me
Usher ruined music 😡!!!
My husband and I are not huge R&B fans and he is huge into Ska and country music. But let me tell you he shows T-Pain’s Tiny Desk Concert to anyone who will listen because the man is just so talented. Mad respect for him.
Zapp and Roger were the orginal OG's. T-Pain loved them. Computer love ans I want to be your man, are classics...sometimes you have to pay homage.
anyone who watched the masked singer know tpain would do just fine without autotune, that's just his artistic intent to use it
Are we forgetting that Usher gave 25 women herpes
I don't get it. People have been using autotune the way that T. Pain does since the late-90s, early-2000s (for example, Cher's Believe). It had been done. He just perfected and popularized it. And people kept doing it after him because LISTENERS LIKE IT. Music is not just for the artists, but (arguably more) for the people who listen to it, and if people like the vocoder-autotune sound, then that is that. Leave the man alone!!
Preach Bro!
Usher doesn't think T Pain is a real singer. Please, his Tiny Desk features some of the best RnB chops you'll ever hear. Not a hint of autotune, just his incredible voice and a piano.  And let's be clear, Jacob Collier is open about his pitch correction. He will pitch correct notes one or two Hz, tiny corrections but that guy is a damn perfectionist
Dangelo is looking fresh as always
Auto tuned is the cherry on top when used correctly
Twitter ppl need to take a chill pill all of that non sense is making my brain hurt.
Usher acting like autotune murdered his mother, bullied him in highschool, beat him in alleyways at university, fired him from 3 different jobs, broke into his house, stole all his belongings, kidnapped his kids and then set the entirety of his family on fire.
I’m pissed, because back then I knew T-pain could sing, but he became popular because of his auto tune. I don’t understand how hard it is for people to just look up a goddamn video of him singing without it.
You need to check out Charli XCX’s “Don’t Delete the Kisses” cover. There is so much autotune and it sounds so good!!!
PLS DO VID ON GABBIE HANNAAAA AHAHAHAHHAHhh..?
i hate usher -_-
Music industry: hush-hush uses autotune to turn 'fuckable' into 'talent' and small mistakes of actually talented people into non-issues Murika: WOO SKINNY GUY/CHICK PUSSYPECKERCANDYSOTALENTEDWOWKAWAIIIDESUUUUUUUUUUuuUuUuUuU!!!!!  TPain: Sees the tool's potential as a way to modify the instrument of his already ACTUALLY talented voice and uses it in the open, honestly Murika after some petty bully of a dickheaded numpty who ABSOLUTELY uses autotune in his own editing (LIKE EVERY ARTIST TO VARYING DEGREES) judges TPain for using autotune honestly and creatively: surprised pikachu with 'disturbed sleep morty's' face, holding a pitchfork in one hand and torch in the other, winding up like a baby before wailing intent on trying to destroy this guys life and career's legacy but sleeping on actual criminals and evil fucks  Even the most moderately intelligent people: crowd mixed between offended tea sipping and actively rolling up newspapers to smack idiots on the snout
T-Pain’s tiny desk was literally everything, watched the whole thing. He is such a talented person and I only wish him well
Literally lil peep 🥺🥺
d’angelo busted out the video proof for this one !! really enjoyed it hehe
i dont get how you can ruin something by making something, like that's an oxymoron it literally doesn't work, the only person who needs to like T Pains music is him. These accusations are becoming ballsie like if you don't like his music listen to someone else; he didn't scare away all the other singers of that genre.
13:46 "two random small artists idk" hUh?
Autotune is in music going back to the 70s. I don't know how he ruined music with it! They just don't want to give that man his flowers.. Even though he won the Masked Singer! Smh...
Its always the insecure dudes with the STDs🙄🤚🏾
In order to make auto tune work, you actually have to be a good singer using it. Most people use auto tune for extra flavor and a stylistic choice. Doesn’t make sense to hate on it
good music is good music, autotune or not. cry about it
I liked buy you a drink long ago. If you're talented, I don't care what random things you use. Usher must not have realized what he was saying or how it would affect (I hope so at least)... TPain is great 💙
D'Angelo once again SPITTING FACTS. i can sing, but if i was covering 'uta wo utau hito' i would 100% put a heavy autotune on the chorus, and if i was covering any of mwk's popular songs i would put one on the entire vocal performance, but i wouldn't use it on most of my own music. there's a time and a place for autotune and manual tuning (via melodyne, newtone, vocalshifter etc.). it's a tool/artistic effect, not a crime LMAO
I like used to hate auto tune when it first started being kind of big (even tho I always liked tpain, idk lol) but like, now? I LOVE autotune. One artist I can't stand people talking down on for using auto tune is Travis Scott. I've seen so many people say "he can't sing" and I have no idea where they're getting that from lol. Honestly I love his voice and I lowkey get offended when people talk down on him. I'm kind of a stan tho so... lol
enfim, a hipocrisia
Weekend and T-pain album pls
I'm trying to find the new channel, but I simply can't find it anywhere....
Are we forgetting Cher believing in life after love??
Man leave Usher alone it ain’t his fault 🤬 Usher is still a great talent and so is T-Pain. People have opinions and falling outs. For all we know it could be a deeper issue.
Tpain doesn’t bump and grind on young girls in concert so he ruined music?   Ooookay
T-Pain: gets cancelled for using autotune The vocaloid community: 👁👄👁
Hey D'Angelo! I wondered if you had heard Andy Frisella - He has a podcast called REAL AF and the 75Hard program that has been getting traction on social media. I wondered if you could do a deep dive on him and his content, because after all, you are the new Ace of the Deep Dive!! Anyway, I adore your content! Keep talking about whatever you feel like!
T pain is the greatest under appriciated
T pain is the greatest under appriciated
T-Pain getting criticism once… 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great video! Thank you for making me a renewed T-Pain fan! The cancel culture is overplayed! Love & Light.
12:05 that legit was an argument back when electric guitars were beginning to be a thing in rock, as in fr fr
I like T-Pain and Usher's music. T-Pain is not only a fantastic exceptional artist, but also an incredibly personable person. Usher has some good songs, but personally I don't find him particularly likeable. Sure, Usher was a-hole, but T-Pain is obviously not resentful and if Usher has apologized, all the discussions are completely unnecessary.
That hoodie is too cute.
omg griff <3
T-Pain is one of the artist who popularised auto-tune and he is still one of the best to use it in his music
sooo..am i trippin or is this the music from .Hacksign on ps2??? maybe im trippin...its late and im drunk. *kanyeshrug*
Can you cover the Black creators Tik Tok strike???
Thank you for establishing our roles right off the bat
hey d'angelo- there's a situation happening right now about a youtuber named anna campbell. basically she manipulated and abused her girlfriends publicly and privately. she created a toxic environment where her girlfriends overdosed and were physically and mentally abused. most of her victims were young (all of them younger than her) and she was also involved with underage girls. three of her victims came forward and posted a video on Natalia Taylor's channel. their names are Natalia Taylor, Taylor Lynn, and Kaylee Jade. this situation needs more awareness brought to it. i would love if you could make a video to bring this to people's attention because anna is still denying that any of this happened edit: another victim came out with her story. her name is maddy eve. anna was also involved with gaslighting a youtuber named kahlen barry publicly and privately
T-Pain's power level is over 9,000 and I would not want it any other way.
i don’t think usher realized that kanye popularized the use of auto tune in singing by a lot 💀
This dudes videos all sound like asmr.  But to the topic: T-Pain is infallible musically. He
On today’s episode of D’Angelo Wallace spitting facts
Three Ringz Circus was the first CD I bought back in the day. T-Pain will always be one of the artists I love to listen to. People are just jealous of those with success. Finding excuses for failure instead of accepting their failures and learning from mistakes.
Agree with all the T Pain commentary, love him, liked the video.  But, I have to disagree with your arguement that pitch is just as important as other factors.  Pitch is the foundation of good vocal singing.  You have to have pitch before any of the other factors matter.  You don't have to have perfect pitch, but if you don't have good pitch you don't sound pleasing to the ear as a singer.   You can have power, vibrato, tone, range, clarity, diction, etc if your pitch is trash people probably don't consider you a good singer.
T pain is dope and Usher is a hater
I think this video was just an opportunity for D'Angelo to showcase his fav artists, hahaha, Jacob Collier....checking him out right now.
T-pain off autotune is like when Rock Lee takes the weights off
I love T-Pain wtf
You might be pretty, but you'll never be as pretty as D'Angelo Wallace
I don’t like t pain music but I don’t won’t him cancelled look he didn’t ruin music
Is this "big project" just gunna be some big flex on how committed your fanbase is? lol
Usher is trash. T pain is such a lovely artist and just an all around great person.
He... had the flight attendant...wake him up..to give him his shitty ass opinion
T-Pain is so nice tho. Fuck Usher for that shit.
Masegoooooo yess omg and giveon!! R&b is killing it rn
T-Pain deserves better. He's endured so much shit talking over the years.
"People on Twitter"    Ah, i can already see where this is going
🤔14:36 "But I just need ya'll to understand that Jacob Colliard is talented to the point of it being demonic! OK? That man must be stopped and he does not represent like most people's singing ability even if they are good!  🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
And this is how I know I am geriatric... **cackles in Roger Troutman and Zapp**
im so sad that's part of the reason we didn't have more t-pain hits for so long. i hope he's doing a lot better! He looks like he's having so much fun too. SMH can't believe it was usher.
totally unfair t-pain seems like the nicest guy and has a great natural singing voice...his use of autotune is a total choice for the sound and i love it, i totally prefer outright obvious autotune over quiet correction to make someone's voice sound better naturally than it is
D'Angelo mindset is healthier than a raw vegan diet like damn♢♢♕
Wow the last time i heard from you, you were an art channel xD
This whole video was straight facts!!! out here getting emotional
Lmaoooo. He’s been doing this for nearly a decade
why you look like gay bro
@13:00
Why people saying ur dead???
Why is so much People saying u Commited Suicide and lauded there on The Groud Lyin there if u still got ur YouTube Acc ur not dead
All those obviously auto tuned songs in the past and he's focusing on T-Pain? Believe, Computer Love, most Phil Collins songs. Usher is a straight HATER. There are been 'traditional' R&B songs before and since then, made by men, that were hits
EVERY SINGLE POP MUSICIAN (including Usher back then and now) uses melodyne or a similar software to pitch correct their vocals in a way that isn’t “noticeable” and get that perfect pop sound. Auto tune does pitch correct but most people use it for the vocal effect (just like T-Pain did). T-Pain has an AMAZING singing voice. If everyone was banned from using any kind of vocal tuners T-Pain would rule the music industry with his amazing voice. Usher is a bitch.
Am I the only one who has never heard of T-pain before??
He was great on the Gus and Eddy podcast
To take someone out their comfortable space, in the middle of their journey, whenever they were headed to, probably a vaca, a getaway...  to pull someone away to make a comment like that🤨 he literally made T-pain get off the plane in a different world... "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all" is a saying I'd say is befitting here.
Another great video! Everything mainstream sounds the same now anyway. Usher thinks too highly of himself. He peaked young and pulled some questionable shit himself.  Yes Usher has talent, but to point the finger and say it's all T Pain's fault music has been destroyed it too big a leap and not true.
I travel to all kinds of music festivals and T.Pain in the middle of the day at Bonnaroo is one of my most favorite performances ever. Every single person in the crowd has a blast. #TPainForever
as an artist, thank you lmao
I was in my early 20s when T-Pain became popular, he just changed the game forever.
01:20 OH GOD !!! He DID NOTTTTTTTT actually say “eXpresso”...!!!!!????!?!??? Granted- I mean ....: admittedly he did state he “wasn’t a Java Person” however ...., he just CANNOT be One Of ........ “..THOSE People.”  Godd No !
Poor man. What happened to "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?"
I actually really like the robotic sound of auto tuned music. It sounds good. If that means I have a bad music taste then fuck it guess I have a bad music taste.
Thank you T Pain for not using your powers to control my mind 🙏
T-Pain literally REVERSE ENGINEERED a closely guarded recording industry secret with auto-tune and the various programs, plug-ins, codecs, etc. that he uses in his music. That is PASSION, PERSEVERENCE, and GENIUS.
But yet everyone wanted to sound like T.pain and work with him. His songs were everywhere and they were all hits.
"Am i the only one that likes the sound of auto-tune" i listen VOCALOID, is literally auto-tune with anime looking characters lol
i love how Usher's complaining about the use of melodyne/autotune while i can garantee you he (or his production/mixing/mastering team) uses it too. just in a different way/intensity. the way he told T-Pain is just unacceptable.
I liked the photography analogy, as someone who does use photo shop to tune up my photos, yes I can sit for 1 hour to get the perfect fully manually tuned photo or I could use photo shop after the fact while still having a pretty damn good base photo. Also I’m poor so it’s not like I can compete with a pros $10k camera without a bit of touch ups
I've always respected T-pain over most artists who used Auto-tune because of how much care and love he had for his craft. And how actually talented he is. Plus, the guy just seems like a sweetheart and is always pleasant to hear from
T-Pain sang the national anthem live at a baseball game and proved that he can sing his face off. WTF these trolls got on him using autotune?? It just balances out your tone.
wait until twitter learns about melodyne
When did D'Angelo get married? I think he married himself ; and he is THEE ONLY person allowed to do so ever.
I ❤ T-Pain soooo dayum much. Mad at Usher now. Lol
Lol as if Usher did not have a voice that sounds like autotune in some of his music videos litteraly what the heck ? 😭 I watched "this is pop" and honestly I like Tpain he's sounds to be a nice man always smiling and this boycott he came throught really makes me angry 😤.
Imagine waking someone up from their sleep just to tell them they ruined music lmao
i felt the dixie slander coming as soon as you started talking about auto-tune..
Usher literally invites fan's to join him up on stage to give him lapdances (I am not joking) Yea Usher T-Pain is the problem sure XD
I don't think that T-Pain ruined music, I think that he made it interesting. If wasn't for T-Pain I probably wouldn't be listening to R&B because I used to find it boring.
i love seeing u so happy talking about something ur so passionate about, I hope u continue to make more videos about music in the future!! x
Lol i love how everyones an expert in audio productions now
I love auto tune too, even heavy auto tune. I never understood why people criticized people like Kesha so much when she debuted bc her music is SO GOOD even now? And her natural voice is amazingly pretty. Anyway, people can have their own opinion on what music sounds good. Some people like auto tune, some people don’t. It just doesn’t ruin music as a whole bc you don’t like it, you know?
I am completely incapable of finding that hoodie. Can someone please tell me, where I can get one for my girlfriend?
I probably would’ve put my hands on Usher had I been on that flight. What he said was crossing the line
The second you say "People on twitter" we all know it's some other bs that twitter spit out again
That is so friggin sad that this hurt him so bad. So sad.
Usher OBVIOUSLY hasnt seen the masked singer if he told him hes ruining it for real singers and rappers. Tpain could very welp br famous without autotune. But he revolutionized it
the Sideways video on autotune (The Problem With Auto-Tune) is a very good one on this subject.. he also goes into the undeserved ridicule of T-Pain.  edit: just thought i'd mention it, i feel like this video and that one are good companion pieces : )
Do people not realize other music out of popular music exists? Music isn't one kiddy pool guys
usher still hasn’t made it up to us for forcing justin bieber into our lives so i think he should sit down and take stock of his life choices for a hot minute before talking shit on ANYONE lmao
Is that just me or is it "not like other girls" in blue?
I have to agree with Usher here. He is not saying T-Pain's music was bad. What he is saying is that T-Pain started a trend that somewhat destroyed music(at least R&B that is). Pitch correctness was just an aid. Today, artist depends on it.
I have come to the conclusion that D’angelo’s new channel is all a social experiment on hype and if it isn’t that than wtf else could it be.
This is so sad. And I do not agree with usher. T Pain is a pioneer. Love him. 💕
And he was awoken from his slumber ! For disrespect
He wouldn't dare fix his lips to utter that nonsense to Roger & Zapp (Computer Love, etc.)
When you find out who Shamir is from a short snippet of video.
Peter Frampton….
This was an awesome vid thank u!!
R&B is super lucrative rn actually and the past 4 years it has been super poppin idk what the fuck these people are on. IMO if u say he ruined R&B you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
come on guys, this was the plot of Trolls World Tour, it’s not that hard.
😱👍👍He won the  mask singer Let me see Usher do it. Enough said!!!!!!🙃🙃👍👍❤️
tpain is such an incredible guy and he really lead the way for so many creative uses of autotune. without tpain i dont think a lot of subgenres of pop would exist. his music is amazing and obviously nobody was as talented as him to successfully pull off that style first.
Sorry, D'Angelo, I have always been in agreement with Usher.  I enjoy T Pain, now, AFTER auto tune days.He had a beautiful voice. I figured he had no pipes when his music used that auto tune. What a waste!
With or without autotune T Pain sounds great.
stevie wonder literally did a version of auto tune MULTIPLE times in the 1970’s
sideways actually did a great video on this concept last year too, explaining a lot of people's misconceptions about autotune/pitch correction. here's the link for anyone interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko  there is no t-pain slander in the d'angelo household.
Cher’s Believe is a banger. T-Pain’s records are bangers. Geniuses take chances and use new tools 🤷🏾‍♀️
I feel so bad for him both from a musical standpoint (bc his music is legendary) but also from a basic human standpoint. Imagine someone you look up to telling you that essentially your main life road was harmful and a waste of time.
And you don't get a Tiny Desk concert unless you can bring it like T Pain. Look at the great artists that have performed. All Amazing!
Bruh this again
So sad Usher couldn't lift TPain up, (where he belongs, due to his talent). This is kind of douchey any way you look at it. For God sake, go back to the brilliant, grounbreaking "Rock It" by Herbie Handcock! All artists are different...and so many great singers use it to some extent. If you like it and it sounds good, that is ALL that matters. Thanks for this video, you are a really amazing, positive, incredibly intelligent & talented person. xx
Can we talk about the caption in Save Your Tears performance was "two random small artists idk"
ok
“Two random small artists idk” I fuckin love it.
FKA TWIIGGGSSSS ✨✨✨✨✨
Not me about to delete ushers music out my phone because he’s being a hater…
Auto tune is basically a general thing in the music industry at this point. They’d probably end up stabbing the artists they stan in the back.
Man hearing T-pain about to cry was so rough. F you usher. ;-; 1 like=1 prayer for T PAIN XDDDDDDDD
I've always had the impression that Usher and Chris Brown were the biggest assholes in pop culture. Ever since I was a kid I always felt very meh about them.
omg I wasn’t expecting Shamir to show up in this! <3
The way T Pain had to look away and process his emotions… Like literally I could have cried just seeing the hurt in his face
One comment can absolutely wreck a person for a long time.  When I finally decided to transition to male, one of the things I had never worried about "passing" with was my voice.  As a child I had such a low singing voice that I sang with the boys in the tenor section in choir despite being AFAB and - at that time - presenting female.  I've always been fairly good at manipulating my voice as well, and thought that it was overall neutral-sounding and could skew masculine or feminine as-wanted.  But one day on a Zoom voice call, someone I'd never met before greeted me with, "hello sir, how are you?" based on my masculine name.  In a masculine tone and pitch I felt confident in, I replied, "Great, how are you?" and her reaction was, and I quote, "Oh!  A woman!"  Now, this was a well-meaning stranger who had no idea what they'd just said might be upsetting to me at all, so clearly it's not the same.  And ftr, I know that logically, cismen get misgendered on the phone, too.  And no, I'm not overly sensitive to being misgendered - I have a thick skin.    My point is just that despite all this logic, those three words have stuck with me and I've been self-conscious about my voice ever since.  I can't imagine how much worse I would have felt if it had been from a friend who knew it would hurt me.  tl;dr the fact that you use your platform to encourage being a better person and let us all witness your personal growth as your audience slaps, because with a platform as large as yours, it's not just about you and what you believe in - you're cultivating that same mindset in millions of viewers.  That's damn good work worth doing, and I'm glad you exist.
I'm pretty sure that other musicians have used auto tone like T-Pain and are still famous.
Everyone saw the clip majority didn’t watch the episode, they broke it down pretty good and how tpain got the idea from listening to a jlo song
i dont even listen to tpain but it is just so rude that user would say that to his face. no one person can ruin music
As someone who has lived in the really, really Deep South for a long time, I'm fretting over the ever increasing misuse of "y'all"  as it becomes more popular among the woke for some reason. "Y'all" is singular. The plural of "Y'all" is "All y'all."  I'm not joking. I hear those terms used more in one day than most people do in 6 months down here in lower Alabama; I know of what I speak.
Imagine waking your friend up JUST to tell them that they fucked up a whole industry... That their contributions to that industry actively ruined it for the "real" contributors... And still calling yourself their friend afterward.
ANYONE WHO AGREES THAT TPAIN IS THE CAUSE OF THE R&B DROP OFF DO NOT LET ME EVER CATCH YOU SINGING OR DANCING TO BUY U A DRANK MKAY?!?!?
17:40 KURT HUGO SCHNEIDER WORKED WITH T-PAIN???!
T Pain deserves BETTER THAN THIS
at the end of the day is the composition that matters in art, not the tools you use to make it.
When you said y’all just need to be better at finding music I felt that so hard 😂 I TELL SO MANY PEOPLE THAT!!!
Dude I  love T-Pains voice he sang and won the masked singer and he streams amoung us with Granny.. bruh canceling this man over something this stupid is just.. sad.
Ya. He didn't ruin music. Alot more people did that one. Lmao. T was creative with it.
not that long in and im already hearing "bts uses autotune" 💀
This was such a well crafted argument. Nailed it again, D’angelo
It truely speaks to his character to be so thankful and shout you out, although he's a celebrity 😉 great video D'
You know I really appreciate having the fan-girling and stuff that is a little more uplifting because I've been goin through it too. Is nice <3 (Not that your commentary and critiq isn't, just that my noodle needs a break sometimes.) I APPRECIATE YOU~*~*~*~*~ K THNX BYE~*~*~*~*~*~
Cancelling T Pain for using autotune is like crucifying Jesus for doing miracles...     wait.
I've been avoiding this video for a while, because I have a lot of emotional association with the period in my life where I was a hardcore T-Pain fan, but I'm positive this is my favorite video of yours. I absolutely love talking about musical tastes, and you did so in your usual eloquent and respectful fashion. You're an awesome dude D'Angelo, and I'm excited to watch your channel keep growing.
ok i’ve noticed that from time to time u talk v poorly about justin bieber. at first i really didn’t care, but the more i think about it the more confused i get. u can’t say that he’s a bad singer, neither can u say that he is a bad person with no heart or empathy. so my question is: what is there to hate about him sm that u have to mention it in every other video?   p.a.: i truly love ur content and have been following u for months now. keep the great work up! <3
Stan Twitter is a hot mess 😭
17:38 😳 he really does sound like a Disney character omg he’s so beautiful!
Usher is the last person who needs to be talking.
Yes! Auto tune is an instrument a tool used by artist to achieve a sound not unlike a guitar or drum
not u saying expresso😭 i was bout unsubscribe
loving the little ad for willows new album,  lately i feel everything, coming out july 16, including the hit single transparent soul
good video!
Usher is just mad bc he's no longer relevant
I like acoustic guitars and electric guitars ruined music..... Bob Dylan: 👁👄👁
T most definitely doesn't deserve ppl saying he " ruined music"... I'm sorry but aint music a form of art? And not everybody express things in the same way so .. how could u say ONE person who expresses themself in their own way is doing it wrong 🤔 ya no.
T-Pain is dope, hope he continues to make music and get recognition. Usher did host the iheartradio Awards.
BYE IMAGINE YOU BEING AN UPCOMING FAMOUS SINGER  SOMEONE WAKING YOU UP JUST TO TELL YOU THAT YOU RUINED THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. ESPECIALLY IF YALL ARE FRIENDS
I know this is off topic but seeing Rasheeda from Love and Hip Hop in T-Pain’s video threw me for a loop that’s all have a great day 😂✨🌸
didn't we just have this discourse with the boomers being like "Digital art isn't real art"
the way you said "eckspresso" at around 1:15 hurt me on an emotional level and deeply offended me. im advocating for cancelation of d'angelo
okay so when is this Bee’Angelo hoodie coming out 👀
Idk why but it’s just so funny to me that people are “cancelling” T-pain over auto-tune……….literally if you don’t like it when artists use auto-tune that’s on you but like….it’s such a small thing to get mad about.
remember when cancellation was actually about serious issues?
Then what about Cher? “Is there life after love” was auto-tuned from here to heck, she started the trend up again and sold millions of copies!
Thank you, as always beautifully presented and very informative!
He did tall about this long ago on season 1 of Masked Singer actually now that I watched that
What’s a good Jacob colleir song sorry if I spelt his name wrong
If auto tune ruined music. Stop listening to auto tuned music 🤣
I kinda like the thought of saying he could be the one to ruin music but also come on it t pain the best lol
Who is WE homie the people cancelling T Pain are some straight idiots fr.  All love D’Lo I love your videos and keep it up
I always enjoy how deeply analytical and intensive these videos are. such good food brain
I think using autocorrect to correct small mistakes or as an artistic choice sounds fine, but when it's almost the entire song (the live action Beauty and the Beast comes to mind) it totally takes the magic and life out of the song for me so I'm not a fan of it.
I love t pain and I’ve been in love with his music since epiphany. I will always stand up for t pain period
Bruh people are ignoring that TPain never could have pushed music towards auto tune if general everyday people didn’t decide to listen to auto tuned music over non auto tuned music
Wait yoooooooo that clip of Shamir is from my video!! From a performance of Tunnel Vision with Rina Sawayama at Mercury Lounge in NYC back in 2018.  I cannot believe a popular youtuber, one that I actually like and watch no less, has actually watched my video and wanted to use a clip from it in something 🥺
on a real not tho why are we just ignoring that usher literally peed on a minor 13 year old on tape and no one seems to remember at all. and T-pain and Usher BOTH have a very problematic past with working with woman abusers like Chris Brown and Tory Laynes and many more. Can we stop supporting anyone like this regardless if their music is good, i really like D'Angelo but to ignore that these men work with known abusers and men that take advantage of young woman and even CHILDREN is kinda gross ngl unless you honestly don't know. but that's just my opinion and im not bashing him or anyone for liking their music
So are they gonna cancel Cher for using auto tune in the 90s early 2000’s
DAngelo :talking about how auto tune can be used tastefully . My Kpop obsessed brain: wAe KareGggi MowLahh..
has anyone seen the t-pain mashup where he sings with a piano?? man’s can sing no doubt
really appreciate D'Angelo for actually giving facts. As a musician and sound technician I can confirm the plugin used for correcting notes is indeed melodyne, "auto-tune" is just the specific effect. Every studio artist today has their pitch corrected in melodyne and even in live performances the notes are flatlined, (you can put pitch correction in post) so basically whenever a microphone receives input this signal is transformed through the effect.  Pitch correcting is ok. There's still great singers that use pitch correction like Ariana Grande or Mariah Carey. Vocals aren't perfect and that's ok. It's ok to use pitch correction and it's ok not to, it will just sound more raw.
Somebody needs to whoop Ushers ass from what it sounds like.
i love watching people talk ab things they r passionate about.
tpain is a legend. a GOD.
broooo what.. there's still great R&B even nowadays, and whoever denies it just doesn't bother to find it.
Ive personally never been a huge fan of T-Pains music but art is subjective. I've still enjoyed some songs that featured him. But he didn't ruin music. He's just using a newer type of instrument and he popularized it. So other artists have been using it as well. That's not ruining music. It's evolving it.
I don't understand why people seem to have an issue with auto-tune now. Like so many artists use auto-tune and there's no problem with that. Music is an art, and if a singer wants their art to be preformed with auto tune then who are we to say "you have no talent if you hide behind auto-tune". I wonder if these people know that singers don't actually sing in their music videos, because at this point I think they know nothing about music at all.
22:20 by technicality, not quite because you need to be monetised first and I think something else also
But I don't believe that Beyonce is R&B though. She's a pop queen. Comparing her to other actual r&b artists is like saying Billie Eyelash is a rapper.
Usher talking about autotune: He burned all our crops, poisoned our water supply and delivered a plague unto all our houses People with sense: He did? Usher: No, but are we just gonna wait around until he does?
I don't know why but the sleeves of dangelo's hoodie look like velvet but ik it's not.
So when are we going to talk about his support of woman abusers such as r Kelly, Chris brown, and most recently Tory lanez? Says he’s “on the fence” about making money with a collab with TL because of shooting MTS in the foot. Fucking literally. Or are you purposefully ignoring that part?
I feel like the project is just D'Angelo seeing how many subs he can get without uploading a video.
Art is so abstract, how do you do it wrong? 🤔 One of the biggest lessons I learned is that tools are tools and all that matters is how you use them and what you can achieve with them. There is no "supposed" to use it this way or that way. That's dumb, art is one of those few things in life which don't require boundaries.
Buy U A Drink is a timeless classic and I feel sorry for anyone who doesn’t agree. No aux privileges for you.
Usher didn't mean what he said it was the herpes talking😊#STDsMakeSumPeepleHateLife
How tf can someone have the audacity to say to another artist that by finding their style and freely expressing themselves they ruined it for everyone else??? I'm sorry WHAT?!?! THIS IS THE MOST GATEKEEPING SHIT I'VE EVER HEARD!!!!!
I think I just got used to the autotune sound by now
Who is usher?! He isn't even in the game anymore lol stfu
ok not me having pms and bursting into tears from the singing clips kjkjbs  anyway i'd love more videos of d'angelo talking about music!!
People are fucking ridiculous. Auto-tune wasn't invented by T-Pain, he's just the first person who made it GOOD???? So what the fuck? T-Pain made auto-tune sound better than anyone else and we all fucking have rocked it for so long and now... I just cannot. People get so tunnel-visioned and act like nothing outside of their dumb thoughts exist.
Man. This is reminiscent of digital art not being "real art". Anyone who knows anything about ANY art form will know that subjectivity is what makes the art world go round. It sucks that people still have to tear each other down.
this whole thing reminds me the discourse of wether digital art is “real art”
Okay actually there’s a Twitter tread exposing his past tweets that were pretty bad. So he’s not exactly a “good” person but he makes good music. Just wanted to clarify because I have a feeling y’all wanna backtrack saying he’s a good person after defending XXX for beating up his pregnant girlfriend.
I think, if anything, one could be mad at those who use autotune/pitch correction in a way that isn't super obvious. Just like photoshop. It could definitely be considered problematic to create unrealistic and unachievable expectations that sound or look real. But if it doesn't sound or look real in the first place then it's just obviously ARTificial. (btw, autotune and pitch correction is used even in live performances and by the best singers in the world.) On a personal note, I never liked the sound of autotune. But Lana Del Rey of all people used it quite obviously in a song on her latest album and it sounds brilliant.
people loved his sound so much they tried to imitate him. that happens every time. ruined? it branched into various art forms. don't tell me "i love cats, i love every kinda cat" isn't a work of art. algorithms help us to find what we like. use the platform that works for you, and find the good stuff! (who else is googling chloe rn?) i'm a fan of metal, and voice distortion is used a lot for cool effect.
The way I see it. T-pain did something that set him apart and people enjoyed it. Who cares if it's autotuned? In my own opinion, if you are entering the entertainment industry, whatever you do, you should be able to at least entertain your audience, which T-pain has done. Usher just sounds like that jealous friend.
People listen to Tom Waits and the man signs like he smokes 12 packs of cigarettes in a day, how can they complain about auto tune lmao
Autotune can definitely be used in great ways, that's why I love early 2NE1 songs so much
Pretty sure that auto-tune is used in all music genres, T-Pain just turned it up to 11 and ppl are mad that they didn't think of it first.
THE DIXIE SLANDER AHAHAHA
You can hear the autotune! He's not trying to hide the sound of it, you may not like how it sounds but he's not using autotune to sound like a polished beautiful singer, the robotic quality is so obvious. I think the channel Sideways poiinted out T-Pain is no tthe problem, it's people using technology to edit and tune their voices, chop up pieces of different takes and stitch them together and make it sound really, really natural--- and they can do pitch correction live now! You don't know if the vocals you hear are real anymore. T-Pain is honest.
Y’ALL IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS GO WATCH “THE PROBLEM WITH AUTOTUNE” BY THE YOUTUBER SIDEWAYS
Hasn’t usher literally used auto tune himself??? The audacity
I've always liked the sound of autotune. I don't think it's as much of a shortcut as an instrument in itself you use in tandem with your voice.
I think I'll need to point y'all in the Sideways' channel and watch his video on autotune. The point of pitch correction is to NOT be noticeable. The robotic autotune sound isn't lack of talent. It's an aesthetic choice. If someone doesn't like it, it's not "ruining the music". Just go look for music you enjoy.
What is going through someone’s head to ask a flight attendant to wake their friend up just to diss them?! Like seriously WTF
If anyone has ever actually heard tpain sing they’d know he has an amazing voice ! It was just his style ! What a shame, poor tpain, he’s such a sweet guy too
Omg, T-Pain's skin is ACTUALLY that smooth. He is a god
Shoutout to D’Angelo for knowing about Melodyne 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Tpain has a spectacular  voice  with and without auto tune and he’s proven it.
T-pain doesn't deserve fake friends, he deserves real friends but also, this man and his family deserve nothing but all the good things in life and happiness. They are sweet angels from above <3
Is the keyboard purely decorative?
9:34
The rnb is dying comment was stupid af. Like haven't you heard of Frank Ocean
"T-Pain is so powerful he could literally brainwash all of us for the rest of time" I for one welcome our auto-tune overlord!
Usher toxic ☣️
T-Pain should SEE your video.. !!!
D’Angelo is planning on making jewelry on his secret channel, but he first needs to harvest silver and gold from the play buttons because he spent all his budget on tools without any materials :)
Music is a spectrum r&b is a spectrum stoooppppp
T pain is a pioneer. Love his sound and his voice. He has a great actual singing voice too.
I love T pain
No gimme my coffee 😅Also T-Pain's actual singing voice is so ridiculously awesome!
Is this the reason why I kinda don’t like Usher?
The fact that all of those people are putting the decline of R&B and the increase of autotune solely on TPains shoulders is upsetting. Whats popular in music changes all of the time. Thats not his fault.
Im Happy To See Him Get His Recognition / Kudos🥺🤧.  I Use To Love Listening To Kiss Kiss , Chopped & Skrewed , All I Do Is Win, Get Money , Etc Etc . His Songs Were 🔥 Growing Up
Wasnt there a video of Tpain singing without autotune and he was still hella good?
d'angelo, you have such a big heart and an open mind.
I'm more concerned about why Usher felt the need to impart this information. What was he hoping to accomplish? It seems to come from a place of insecurity. Knowing that T Pain suffered depression as a result is really disturbing.
Saw you on wubz comment section true goat🔥
I just have to say that I could never get through an Usher song, but could through a T-pain song. Although T-pain's songs aren't usually in my genre of music tastes, they were enjoyable. Usher's songs... I have only heard of a handful of, tbh... And the most frequent one is Yeah!
Me personally i like your audio quality really crispy,,, that bass thou
Looks like Usher has another confession, he’s salty af.
It did happen in Rock music with an electric guitar! I remember, at first, people lost their minds when Tom Morello of RATM started making his guitar sound like DJ equipment. Anyone trying to step out of the box and really exploring a new idea is going to be dragged through the mud. It's ridiculous and really unfortunate.
you probably have already found this out,  but it's really hard to get any play buttons without any content, yt expects that they will have some amount of money from watchtime to compensate for the money sent on an award, you might still be able to get one from what I know, but it might be harder to do.
Tpain didnt deserve that pain. He’s an amazing artist and its sad to think of the music he could have blessed us w if usher hadnt been such a lil bitch, his career been dead long before tpain came out
13:00 I think Roomie would respectfully disagree
Have you seen T-Pain on episodes of Bar Rescue? So wholesome. Like definitely the guy you’d wanna grab wings and drinks with and just chill. And I don’t care how much people hate autotune, but when Low came on we were all on that dance floor. I will still get in a thigh workout trying to dance to that song lol
I sang that lego song FOR WEEKS. it’s my favorite song from that movie 😂
people still listen to usher? usher a whole weirdo.
Milli Vanilli literally had whole ass other people singing for them but we’re mad about artistic choices. Tpain didn’t ruin anything, shitty singers have always existed and they always will 🤷‍♀️
Tpain is actually such a beautiful singer :( I grew up with the auto tune so I’m into it, but he also  has a beautiful “normal” voice
I hope t pain sees this
“You know r&b has been on a downfall since tpain” “Frank ocean” “Sorry sir you’re right I’ll leave you alone”
T-pain is the music KING of my adolescent years
funny thing is rappers, pop stars, kpop stars, almost everyone uses it. It's dumb how people are trying to cancel him for THIS, I bet even their favourites use autotune, T Pain doesn't even lie about using autotune.
Had to pause the video to say this: and why on earth would we pay any mind to Usher who spreads STDs like butter on toast? He better leave TPain alone. Mans a talented singer and an icon.
As a sound engineer thank you for speaking facts when it comes to auto tune and vocal processing 🥰♥️
you can’t be mad at someone because they started a trend + be hypocritical about it
I think usher was jealous that someone was MORE POPULAR than him music wise. I remember  only like 2 usher songs from 2005- now. I remember all of T-pains hits and BANGERS!
There's a YouTuber called Sideways that has a video on how AutoTune/Pitch Correction is used everywhere, I recommend checking it out.. (he also has a great video on why the music in Shrek makes it even better (; )
S tier video ❤️❤️
First of all T-pain is one of the coolest most realest people. Second whoever thinks T was the first big auto tune artist must not listen to spanish rap/ r&b. SPM, MC magic, etc. T pushed the bounds of music.. Just as Skrillex did and he came from a rock/emo band...   Y'all getting to him over his success is whack.
Moral of the story Usher is just bitter and he profited of T-pain creativity. PERIOD
He can actual sing.
The man won the Masked Singer, season one, no face or name, his perfect voice moved people! He’s AMAZING!
i see merch omfg
this documentary that he was on is really good and if you haven’t seen it you should!
Just one point: comparing one similar instrument to another, like acoustic guitar vs. electric guitar, isn't quite the same as comparing an "acoustic" voice vs. an "edited" voice. The instruments are constructed very differently, and even if you wire and amplify an acoustic guitar, it's still going to sound like an acoustic guitar. So, natural vs. edited vocals sound very different and it's important to recognize it. Those who are striving to be Beyonce need to understand that, as amazing as she is, she has a unique instrument and ALSO benefits from vocal editing that cannot be reproduced
This is such a well put together commentary, perfect, 10/10
Bro I need some more positive non-controversy videos from you please
Ur actually so gay
.
its a whole ass tv show isnt it
Can u do a video on ur favourite songs
You can just breath and get cancelled at this point.
T Pain is so good! I hope he finds confidence in himself and his talent! He is amazing!
T-pain is literally my childhood. His music and talent is everything
Thank you so much for doing your research because ROGER AND ZAPP???? People today just don’t know
People are idiots. every single recording artist of the last 20 years autotues their voice. Every single one. T-Pain does it for style. Obviously. Like Cher did years ago. It's deliberate. People are idiots.
I feel like T Pain uses autotune in a really creative and interesting way, he has hits and bangers and like everyone stop please just enjoy his music lol
153k on the secret channel!!!
"People on twitter... ya know what I don't think I need to finish that sentence cause you already know something dumb went down." Mood.
peeling my eyes and subscribing to the secret channel now
I love you and I agree with everything. BUT... have you seen Julian Casablancas & The Voidz - Instant Crush (Live) @ Governor's Ball NYC 6.6.14??? what do we think of that? I mean, autotunes was such a thing to a point he can't reproduce it live (just thinking
“Two random small artists idk” 🤣🤣🤣 yesss!
I love t pain! He has a wonderful voice without auto tune
T pains real voice is that or an angel❤️🙏🏻 y’all better leave him alone!
If you don't like a certain type of music, just find some you like. It's not hard.
No, u can't "sing" with autotune
T pain can actually sing. There are plenty of videos of him doing it. I make and produce music, and I dont have an issue with pitch correction in moderation to improve albums...live I dunno how I feel about it. Pitch correction is usually considered different than autotune. Autotune is when you push pitch correction to it max and gives it that robotic flutter. When used as an effect to enhance a song, or just an effect I feel it's acceptable. If you're using it to try to hide your singing I'm not all that about it. Pitch correction is like a standard in music now and I'd bet money in a professional studio people like usher use it sparingly... most r&b, pop, rap, and even poppy emo bands use it. Basically any huge band you can think of use subtle pitch correction in a studio session, and also most times when you see people live dancing around ...yeah pitch correction. However people like t pain, and kanye used it as an effect. He did however popularize it at the time and people ran with it. Right now I'm at the point where you kind of point out what I'm saying and you mentioned melodyne. Another popular software for this is antares. Sorry to repeat some of what you said. I used to be this lofi indie surfy garage rock musician, and now I make beats, and house music. When I do vocals depending on the genre I will use extreme pitch correct as an effect. When you listen to my solo music I made as surfy garage rock indie surf artist I dont and I'm by no stretch of the imagination am a great singer but it suits the music. Just like when I use autotune as an effect for specific songs now ...its a tool. Instruments,mics, rack units, recorders, effects pedals.. they are all tools. I dont think people are really in a place to judge regarding this, and it's cool because as I'm typing this you're somewhat describing the history of it and what I said in the beginning its apparent you want to educate and you've done your research.
This situation was pretty much the music version of when traditional artists tell digital artists that they "ruined" art or aren't real artists.
Art comes in all forms from the genre, mediums used, sounds used, techniques, and so on. Variety is NOT a bad thing nor does it "ruin" anything. There should be something for everyone that they can enjoy.   Some people can say they arent big into music, despite being surrounded by it. T-Pain could be that door opening for them into not just finding music that they love, but might even ENCOURAGE them to do something creative for themselves too. It's so self centred to make your own personal taste the CENTER of everything.  Regardless of what a person's opinion is simply doesnt make it a fact. And the fact is that this man didnt deserve such a self centred thoughtless and inconsiderate OPINION thrown at him. It wasnt even instructive criticism, but a straight up insult.  Edit: It reminds me of how some people say that digital art is "easier" than traditional or ruining it. I cannot.
Somebody please post a compilation of Usher using auto tune in his songs because he HAS… so he should be thanking T-Pain for his “hits”. He is literally a HATER.
T-Pain is one of the purest and most innovative souls to ever be in R&B. This is not even up for debate lien wth?!
Masego? FKA Twigs? D'Angelo has serious music taste
i wanted to hit the like button like every minute of this video, the scope it covers, so many important things discussed with intelligence, wisdom, and heart. i'd expect nothing less from d'angelo :)
secrete chanel to launck your music career.. bring it on darling. xxx
I think a good comparison is when your playing brass like a trumpet, you can put a hat or something to make a whole different sound.
Never realized how wholesome T-Pain was until recently. I love that man.
Pitch does matter.
if ushers mad about autotune he should be mad at hatsune miku
"expresso"
What I've learned is that autotuned has been used bf T-pain and it wasnt until he used auto tuned differently that's when it blew up. Even still auto tuned is still used heck Usher uses it because if not then every song that comes out would sound like hes singing live. Heck even when hes live it's still being used.(I typed this bf actually watch all of this vid so if he says the same thing then that's why I'm saying it now) The real problem, are the companies that are allowing people who have no talent to misuse auto tune and claim that they have talent.
If somebody woke me from my peaceful slumber on a plane to put me into a four year depression I would shove them out of the plane and go back to sleep  Edit: D’Angelo you look hella good today
That pure auto tune sound does sound terrible. But you can't cancel someone for getting famous from that cause it's audiences that choose to popularize and listen to that type of sound.
I'm here for autotune. This sounds crazy but I don't believe that you have to be able to sing to make beautiful songs.  One of the most heartbreaking melodies was the autotune outro on Kanye's "Runaway". Like he's not even saying actual words,  just vocalizing through the autotune and its one of the most eerily beautiful things you'll ever hear.
I hate... everything. Just everything. T pain is a pioneer. And his voice, his actual voice, is beautiful. He used autotune as a gimmick! A tool  Oh and Usher has definitely used auto tune in some of his songs.
Oh how I’ve missed your videos 💕 thank you  for your work!
I mean, have you seen his ERB as Stevie Wonder (vs Lily Singh as Wonderwoman)? Absolute icon, untouchable.
Imagine being mad that other people like what your friend made.
Lemme buy u a drank
T-Pain is an absolute delight, and it's very upsetting that people are mean to him.
T pain and his Twich openings are iconic and I won't stand for this fuckery.
We Stan t-pain. Gtfo, his voice is actually so good without autotune as well. “Real” singers, ma’am there is no such thing. There’s different ranges and tones of singers. Usher is trash.
Omg he looked so sad. I love this video and I adore T-Pain. He seems so nice and genuine.
Usher ass is a hater.  That's terrible. Instead of working on ways to improve your craft in order to continue gaining attention, you tell a Man who is thriving in the industry that he fucked up music because now people are inspired by him...and not you? Yeah that's some crab barrel energy.
1. Thank you so much for the intro to FKA twigs. She's amazing.  2. T-Pain only had that much influence over music (which is far too broad a term for this kind of accusation) because we the customers liked his product. He didn't MAKE us enjoy his stuff, we just did.
Now I got computer love stuck in my head 💕
D'Angelo will not accept any T pain slander
My eyes hurt while watching this and it was very bright so that didnt help, but I enjoyed it despite that and I think that means your videos are pretty cool
Weird to me that Usher dissed t-pain so much but he uses auto tune too? And T can sing WITHOUT IT?!? Like have you seen the video of him singing one of his most popular songs without auto tune? I don't understand? (I cant remember which song but I think its buy you a drank or bartender)
It’s all propaganda t-pain not no where near the first to use auto-tone n blow up
I literally listen to sprung, bartender and buy u a drink on the daily. Catch up yall
Usher's jealousy bothered him so much to the point where he had to make it someone elses problem. That in itsef is a big issue with people these days. They get so butt hurt by other people doing or thinking differently about things that they have to make life hell for others until they conform. Which in itself is cancel cultures biggest issue and why it's such a joke.
Not to mention, T Pain is an amazing singer without autotune. I remember watching his Tiny Desk concert back in 2014 and being amazed. The guy literally sings like an actual angel. Though re-watching that video again now after hearing about the whole Usher conversation a year before, it makes me really sad to hear him joke about having autotune surgically attached. You can tell he wasn't joking about the comment really fucking him up in the head. For anyone that hasn't seen it, this is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIjXUg1s5gc
By usher's own logic he ruined music for real musicians if he uses any midi instruments or post production
I haven’t seen anyone cancelling him over auto tune…  he tweeted something iffy about the Megan and Tory Lanez situation that was downplaying the severity of the issue. I’m not saying he’s a bad person or he meant to be malicious but I don’t support anyone who downplays the severity of abuse and gun violence.
And I can point to several Usher songs where he uses autotune.
F Usher
13:10 whats the name of this song?
Like i don't even understand how ONE artist is supposed to be able to...ruin music? I mean it's music?? Literally anything is allowed and if you don't like something just don't listen to it? I could easily say that german rap ruined music charts here in germany simply because i absolutely despise most songs of that genre but I can also just choos to ignore it and listen to the music I like.  That's the beauty of music, isn't it? The VARIETY. Something you personally don't like might be someone else's favourite song.
Sideways did a video on it and the discourse should have ended there.
Absolutely nothing good come out of a small sentence like "So.. people from Twitter-"  You dont even have to explain why they're bad ,we already know.
HOW DID THIS BRING ME TO TEARS JUST BY THINKING ABOUT A TRUSTED FRIEND SAYING SOMETHING LIKETHAT TO ME T PAIN IVE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT YOU BEFORE IN MY LIFE BUT U ARE (ONE OF MY) BELOVED NOW
You’d make so much h money off of James no joke
Hi D’angelo! I wanted to tell you that I love your videos!! I think you’re so smart and funny and you radiate good vibes!! Thank you for being a positive part of my day! Wishing you all the best and sending love!! 💕🌻 heather
The last time I remember seeing Usher on tv was on TRL. Only reason I remember is because before 2 or 3 separate commercial breaks he would grab the camera and sternly chastise the audience at home for being mean to his wife. What made it better was at one point you could see the VJ in the background waving his hands in exasperation.
Music is a form of expression how could anyone tell him that how he expresses himself is “wrong” it’s sooo disrespectful
I’d like to imagine people canceling T-Pain listen to Travis Scott, the irony at it’s best.
off topic, but all the singers you mentioned in the examples given (high range, low range ect) are so amazing like?????? how did i not know these people (if theyre even human because i genuinely can not process how someone who is not superhuman or is a gift from heaven can get those sounds out of their mouth) exist.. and those random 2 people at 13:47 singing at the end were pretty good aswell. not sure about their names though.
People are so goddamn mean to t pain, autotune isnt the devil its literally just another tool that can be overused in the same way any other tool can be, autotuned voices like tpain are just a more modern take on the older musical styling of talkboxes! D'angelo is correct, literally everything is pitch corrected nowadays, and if it *isnt* its heavily stitched together from multiple takes!
Quick 3rd channel guess: you’re starting a tv show lol
Yo, time to make Usher run this fade.
Pretty cool that Shamir shouted you out  https://twitter.com/ShamirBailey/status/1408992939909525505
You. Spat. Facts
People are too sensitive nowadays tbh
Uuuuuh but Tpain is a real singer...? Have you not heard his voice without auto tune?!
thinking about your message at the end about not wanting to always put out heavy content, its something that helps me a lot. i love watching commentary, but its been all about SA lately, and while thats important to talk about and get justice for, its so fucking sad to see for months on end!! i love watching u deep dive into something “small” like this, because being able to over analyze these situations is lighthearted and fun, not sad
T-PAIN DIDN'T MESS UP MUSIC IF BTS IS USING IT AND STRAY KIDS AND SO MANY OTHER ARTISTS THEN HE DIDN'T MESS UP ANYTHING! Usher is the only messed up one here
2:34 Literally me
Wow, I don't think he's friend if you made him have 4 year depression but okay
Appreciate your intention to put good into the world! It means a lot <3
It's like blaming the guy who created Photoshop for the decline of artistic pictures Edit: i wrote this before going through the video.
There's a great video by Sideways called The Problem with Autotune if you want to know more about the topic :)
Sideways made a really good video about "auto-tune" in the industry
Since you mentioned guitars, a better comparison would be between fretless instruments like violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and ouds and fretted instruments like guitars, sitars, banjos, mandolins, and lutes. Our frets do "correct" our pitch so that we don't have to put our fingers in exactly the right spots every single time, which allows many of us to play chords (particularly with more intricate and complex rhythms). In a nutshell, frets opened up a whole new world of possibilities for stringed instruments that are wildly impractical (if not altogether impossible) on instruments without frets. SOME (but definitely not most) people who play fretless stringed instruments (especially violinists) do one occasion make disparaging comments about fretted instruments (especially guitars and banjos) out of a sense of aggrieved elitism; angry that the popularity they once enjoyed is largely a thing of the past.   The reason I point that out people who hate autotune (like myself) see it as an annoyance. I'm simple self-aware about it and acknowledge that we are a long way from seeing the full extent of the musical/creative potential it can unlock. Autotune was developed as a time saving device. In the old days, singers would have to do multiple takes of a recording to get their performances exactly right, which could take hours. Renting a studio by the hour when you weren't a great singer who could knock out a legendary performance in minimal time made recording a costly endeavor. We perceive autotune as cheating because its corrective AND because it minimizes the time it takes to deliver a vocal performance that would be well within the abilities of a competent singer. We are nowhere near seeing what kinds of things autotune might make possible that would be physically impossible for even the best singers; of seeing autotune transformed from a gimmick into a genuine extension of a singers voice like how amplification came to be an extension of a guitar.
1. T-Pain wasn’t the first person to use auto tuning in that way. Cher was.  2. What is or isn’t good music is subjective. So the only thing usher was mad at was that T-Pain popularized a sound that was different from what Usher was doing. It might not have been Ushers jam, but clearly a lot of music listeners and artists who imitated it enjoyed it so how did he ruin r&b?  3. I would hope that we are at a place and time of awareness about mental health that were not out here trying to destroy folks. If your doing that, re-evaluate your life choices.
Why are people sensitive nowadays
I hope Usher feels like complete garbage about himself for acting like that. How dare you. You wake someone out of their sleep to tell them they suck and throw them into years of depression.
ruining someone’s career over something that’s not even hurting you is so petty i actually feel so sorry for this man and hope these people start getting a life soon
How dare you. Tpain isn't a singer. He is a FANTASTIC singer, sir.
Time to cancel Jacksfilms, I guess, since autotune is evil of whatever
Honestly- why does it matter how you get to the music? Like if it sounds good then what does it matter??
That masked singer bit gave me chills. I had no idea T pain could blow like that!
Giveon is best boi can't change my mind
I have been so proud that I got to sing at Usher's studio once and I love his voice and now I feel like I shouldn't be lol.
T-Pain didn’t ruin music. People heard it, liked it, then started seeking a lot more similar music. If you want you can just not listen...Bashing an artist, at their craft, just because they are successful for it is pathetic.
the stream willow smith aged like milk
Damn D’Agelo that (new?) camera is looking crispy
I literally just got done watching this on Netflix last night. There's a moment T-Pain says the first person to use something new or in a new way is never accepted.
I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT No seriously I can't
leave t-pain alone. hes a good guy, he gave us CLASSICS like booty werk, that shit was fire. usher can kiss my ass
im not even halfway into the video and im already just. even if 'autotune' was the problem in the music industry, the autotune SOUND is not what would be causing that problem, its pitch correction, which is entirely different. i dont even know music and i know that
People on Twitter?  I don’t consider them people
Art is supposed to be something to enjoy and auto tune allows people to make a song that they visualize
It's so dumb cus for an MC your voice is your instrument, your lyrics are your keys. And autotune is just like the electric guitar version of the voice. People don't understand that music is just sound. And lyricists/ MC's are just trying to be creative with their sound!!! Let people create!!! Jimi Hendrix was accused of the same shit. Also, Juice WRLD perfected it! LEGENDS NEVER DIE1
Love Tpain, I hate that someone who’s supposed to be his friend said something so hurtful to him.
went to the tpain lil wayne concert... tpain sang acappella and he has a great voice... better than usher lil nasty self
Usher need to my his business and take his herp medicine since he likes to lie about his status he needs to worry about his lawsuits for spreading bumps
There's mass graves being found under residential schools everywhere and people are worried about auto tune? Are you kidding me?
I got so excited when i  got this notification :)))
Usher is the one who should be getting cancelled here. What an asshole. T-Pain is a treasure (and genuinely talented) and he does not deserve any of this.
I believe you and yes I am bad at finding music. What is your secret source and what can I do besides  write down the ones you mention? Would you make us a playlist? I'd be a patron for it!
that new netflix series is so very good
Props to T-Pain for not absolutely losing it when Usher said that. Also like…Maybe Usher was jealous and worried about his own voice / success so he told him that
people ignore the fact that autotune is such an amazing aesthetic & stylistic choice like …. i literally love artists who use autotune generously. tpain, bladee, etc etc. it’s all beautiful and really tingles my brain correctly
21:20 you are awesome!!! I’m so glad you are happier doing these videos
Well fuck Usher. How disrespectful. T-Pain can sing without auto tune. His voice is truly amazing. Real singers still sing.
T-Pain has used auto-tune his entire career and everyone loved him for it. Yet now Twitter (of course) is tryin to cancel him for using said auto-tune. Make it make sense.
Firstable Tpain changed the game, mfs are ungrateful!!!! And if we gonna use that logic Usher always having his lil bird chest out ruined music cause now everybody take they shirt of for any 2 notes sung 🙃. Like it doesn't make sense cause he's not the 1st
Cher’s BELIEVE is a banger
How can T Pain ruin something when the audience is the one who reacted and loved it ?? Usher is confused
Some people are pianos in trench coats and some people aren’t.
i just feel like t pain always was very obvious ab the auto tune. like it wasn’t even used to make him sound naturally good it gave his voice a different more like synth quality… it was his style not him trying to deceive people or encourage people to be deceptive w pitch correction 😭
t-pain also features on some cheer music and it SLAPS
deangelo !! u probably would not like too but expose trisha paytas!!
As far as male R&B singers, Usher is no where near the top. The nerve of him to be rude to someone. Usher needs to sit down before he tries to criticize someone.
I love the way doja car uses autotune
So Usher just had to say something and he allowed this to come out of his mouth. Yeah whatever.
Yo I saw t pain back in 2019 at electric forest and he was so good! He honestly doesn't need auto tune but he does because he wanted too and it just makes it slap.
omg i just got that lego song out of my head...thanks lol <3 tpain
You alone have the power to amass 132k people blindly following you
As a writer, I would like to come out with my Hot TakeTM that Word Processors ruined writing. All writing!   You used to have to know how to perfectly spell 20 000 - 30 000 words off the top of your head, perfectly execute your grammar, and account for natural human error like your hand slipping and messing up a word on your typewriter or with your quill.   Which is why I would like to formally accuse Rob Barnaby of ruining all literature forever, by inventing WordStar.   Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.  /s
I swear I feel like I’m back in 2005. Like y’all trying to cancel somebody 16 years to late. 😅😅😅wtf.
Omg I need the clip of you saying that people just need to get better at finding music......i need to post that everywhere!!!
T Pain is such a good dude!  I mean he's not problematic and he minds his business.  Usher can take a seat...I feel bad that someone would go out their way to hurt someone.
Okay, but your description of good autotune literally got the 6lack verse from Gorillaz' Pink Phantom stuck in my head. You described it so lovely <3
T Pain forget these fools man.
I only recently found Don Toliver, and 👌👌👌
You changed my mind on autotune! kudos
first twitter cancels scott cawthon for being a trump supporter and now twitter cancels t-pain for auto - tuning.
T pain can actually sing  Unlike usher
Usher comes out of this looking like an absolute PoS...
What I wanna know is; the song Usher & R'Kelly collab'd on, 'Same Girl', considering what Kellz is currently locked up for, shouldn't we be asking some questions?
Auto-Tune is a brand name. Melodyne and Auto-Tune are both pitch correction/editing software, the main difference between them being Auto-Tune can work in real time, although other auto-tuners are available, Waves Tune Real Time for example.
Usher is just salty that T Pain is more influential and will almost certainly have a longer lasting legacy than him
I love your ✨happy✨ content.  Wouldn‘t mind more of it -  Spread the love!🌈💕
i gotta deactivate my twitter tbh
R&B is defffff thriving wth
Tpains song with Techn9ne slaps! It’s called B.I.T.C.H, and there is a message to it.
Usher, T-Pain, but no Alicia Keys when demonstrating range was a missed opportunity given the era.
This is my first video from this channel but you got a sub out of me.
I love T-Pain! He seems like such a a sweet guy. I enjoy watching his live streams. It's disappointing that Usher would be so careless with a comment like that. It's amazing that power he felt T-Pain had to RUIN MUSIC lol like Kanye West made Poopity Scoop. Usher gave us Justin Bieber...🤦🏽‍♀️
Autotune doesn’t really work if you can’t already sing well… @ James Charles god is a woman scandal (also mans can sing now tbh)
Are you gonna talk about the downfall of frenemies? Or is that just a big no thank you? 🤔
D'Angelo, I discovered FKA Twigs late one night on youtube, but I list track of her name. I've been trying searching for descriptions of her incredible videos. I recognized her voice and guessed that she was the artist I was looking for, quick googling later, and I'm positive.  Thank you for helping me find her work again!
People honestly just don't realize that there's a difference between auto-tune and pitch correction. Auto-tune is an artistic choice while pitch correction is more like a crutch.
t-pain is an angel. we must protect at all costs.
It would be super cool if T Pain could collaborate with the wave of up in coming hyperpop artists such as Dorian Electra, Rina Sawayama, etc.
Whenever there’s drama d’Angelo just starts talking and all of a sudden it’s gone … funny how that works yall better start listening more 👏🏻👏🏻
D'angelo just casually exposed the secret on why I sound good in covers as opposed to live.  Melodyne is a singer's best friend.
bruh have you seen him on the masked singer lmao
T-Pain’s use of auto tune was more of an instrument in his music. I don’t think anyone else can use auto tune in the way t-pain was able to, partly because no one can ever be the first to use it in that way like t-pain arguably was.
"You don't sound good with autotune if you don't already have a good voice." Exactly! Rebecca Black's "Friday" was grating, meanwhile Daft Punk's "One More Time" is a classic. Why can't people understand this?
I haven't heard of usher since he was accused of knowingly having unprotected sex with a woman (while having an sti) who said his ejaculate was green
Usher salty.
Screw usher. Imagine your friend not only waking you up to talk shit about you, but not even having the respect to wake you up himself? Like he made some poor flight attendant do it. Then he made t pain come to HIM? if you're gonna start something don't make me put in work 😭
I cackled a bit at the Ariana Grande and The Weeknd caption
Usher is bitter because his career doesn’t reflect what he wanted (to be iconic at a Beyoncé level) and he’s looking for somebody else to blame.
Watch T Pain’s Tiny Desk Concert and tell me he’s not a good artist seriously.
Roger Zapp is a legend
I actually heard T-pain live singing without auto tune.. he sounded amazing
T-Pain seems like a genuinely kind-hearted person. I saw him on This Is Pop and I just melted. You can tell he is salt of the earth kind of good.
I have never wanted to give someone a reassuring hug more than I do rn. He seems like such a sweet teddy bear and as a woman who was raised in music, I can definitively say he did not ruin music, that’s literally the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard
ah yes, my favorite singer. *TYLENOL PAIN RELIEF*
PERIODDDDDDDDD YES THIS IS PERFECT
Little late to cancel him now lmfao. Besides he is an amazing singer without it. Autotune was a style in the early 2000s.
Exactly! Audio Engineers have been putting subtle A.T. on vocal tracks to correct the artists’ pitch since the 97... 🥶🤣  (Insert Spider-Man pointing at Spider-man meme)
Melodyne. Melodyne. Melodyne. Melodyne.  As a producer and musician myself this angers me.
I put off watching this because I thought you were going to bash T-Pain
Even though I’m not entirely a fan, I think T-Pain makes inherently good music. I’ve listen to some of his songs and they are bangers in the R&B industry. I can see the DNA of his music getting passed into other songs that came after him, so it’s obvious that he had an influence on the music industry, but in a good way. And then I listened to Usher, and I don’t really like his music that much. I guess I have a greater appreciation for the stuff of the past.
I cant belive this dumb argument from the early 2000s is back is the dumbest shit ever PLEASE STOP if you don't like autotune dont f-ing listen to it
Not me looking for a couple hours trying to find  the song at 13:09 :,)     K no but seriously please help me
TPAIN IS A NATIONAL TREASURE THAT MUST BE PROTECTED!!!!
I personally don't like that auto tune sound, but that's just my opinion. I can see how other people would think its sounds cool and enjoy it. Music is objective and its stupid to "cancel" someone just because you don't like their style of music
6:30 sin-GinG sin-Gers
There’s an actual population of people that think Bob Dylan ruined music when he switched to electric guitar
Man, cancel Usher for being a lousy friend. T-Pain is awesome, check out his Tiny Desk performance if autotune is such a turn off.
When I was a kid in the 80s I had a plastic mic that would "auto tune" your voice... Guaranteed Usher had one when he was a kid too 😂
love you dangelo!!
T pain is the best. His music makes me happy, his voice without auto tune is phenomenal, he is a great human, loves and respects his wife the way everyone should. One of my favorites for a while! 💕
Plot twist: D’Angelo only made this video because T-Pain made the Twitch shoutout.
T-Pain can sing without auto tune, I saw him in concert when I was in the 6th grade, and he performed his songs without autotune, also Usher can’t really say anything like he didn’t make songs with AutoTune as well, and I didn’t forget that trash Trap & B album he put out a couple of years ago.   Usher is talented, but that comment wasn’t necessary especially when he made music with autotune
People like T-pain uses the auto tune for the effect he can actually sing . It’s more of a way to make your music sound different from others
Music is so broad though, you’d think there’s enough room for people to have their own styles of doing R&B and I feel like Auto tune isn’t new??? Don’t LOTS OF ARTIST USE IT!????
"OMG WE'RE GOING DOWN!!" "shhhhhhhhh shutup shutup shutupppp don't wake up mr wallace"
*H A* bruh wtf y'all cancelling the dude who basically popularized auto tune back in the early 2000's. Music changes, so does culture. Even Michael Jackson used multitrack recording, would you say not creating a song in one take makes it not musical?  Fuck Twitter, y'all. This just asinine now. Criticizing artists for making their art their way. If they got popular, then it was a good move. So shut up and quit being angry at art.
I don’t know why people don’t like him, his music is great and he has a amazing taste in cars
even if you think using auto-tune to make up for a lack of talent is bad, which is it's own discussion with smart and stupid things to say, using it overtly as a creative decision is a CREATIVE DECISION, and wholly valid.
Why would u ever come for T-pain 😒 he's literally unproblematic in my opinion.. Tpain can SANG Sang! Without the auto tune.. I think he just made auto tune a tool to make things sound better, and till this day all his tracks slap!
Remember, the auto tune stuff is a style and a sound and it enhances the voice, auto time and other pitch modultors like it are used heavily I'm daft punks music and I don't see them getting any kind of flack for it.
You think visual aesthetic is more important to a song than being able to sing? Lmao. Dude, we get it, Auto-tune isn't all bad, but you are lashing back tenfold and acting like singing ability means nothing. It's one of the most important aspects of music
Even live performances are often pitch corrected these days. They used to lip sync but now they got these new mics that basically correct your pitch as you are singing live. You really think people are dancing and singing, while mainaining a vocal quality that makes it sound like they're literally in the recording booth? Breathing wise, singing is hard enough while just standing still, imagine doing cardio on top of that. You cannot sing and dance without sounding like you're singing while dancing.
Why did you say a high range and low range are more important than pitch? What do you think it's a high range of? Literally pitch. Vocal range is the range of pitch
Dangelo, i fuckin LOOOOOOVE ur hoodie!!!!  where can i get one!!!!
Sorry to prove you wrong, d'Angelo, but Ice JJ Fish doesn't use Melodyne. On the other hand,  645AR certainly does. And the talkbox was used way before Roger Troutman by Stevie Wonder or Peter Frampton.
Sorry but t pain has one of the best voices without auto tune , this man is pure talent  How can he destroy music .... I don’t understand
The Willow Smith plug, I knew I had subscribed for a reason
what the fuck it's 2021
The irony is incredible.
*Usher almost ruined the music industry by taking out T-pain*
Fka Twigs has such an amazing voice. She has been compared to Kate Bush and once you hear it you can't unhear it
I like T-pain's music :c. During the time T-pain came around His music was popping it was great for its time because It seems new at that time an unique. Usher is mad because t-pain got popular. Usher seems real arrogant and a hypocrite. An from what I remember T-pain can sing without Auto tune.
D'Angelo gave a list full of amazing artist for y'all to listen too. Do as he said haha
The level of bitterness Usher seemed to have is beyond me. To wake him up, just to be rude? what a clown.
Omg why did you have to play a clip of an Adele song now I'm gonna be on a binge singing along with her... for literal days.
You know D'Angelo is spending too much time on Twitch when he starts saying "poggers" in his YT videos! 🤣🤣🤣
FKA Twigs appreciation!
Usher???? Um fuck that dude. He is a punch line anymore. Sucks rosin went into depression bc of it. 😔
The idea that auto-tune have killed music in general is kind of ass. It has saved so many studio sessions, though it has killed a lot of individuality of the singers, it is still one of the greatest tools for unique singing ideas. It is just purist to hate auto-tune.
Not only am I disappointed that u hadda make this D'Angelo (ty btw) I'm also disappointed that Ima watch the whole thing😒... 😏✌🏾💌
14:38 Jacob Collier, who lives in a cave and can perfectly hit notes, is an outlier and should not be counted.
imagine a world that doesnt have d'angelo to watch when youre eating a bagel.... not a world i want to be part of
hope T-pain sees this
Bruh, as SOON as I heard u cold open with "people on Twitter"🤪, I was like "fucc yea, le go D'Angelo" lol. N yes, apparently I am uh "rapper," as the kids say these days...😏
This generation doesn't know shit about music history and music in general and it showsssss
Dang that video clip of tpain talking about it really hurt my heart.
At least T-Pain isn't giving people herpes. The nerve.
Been a fan for a while, but your music taste is SO GOOD.
Your hay is freaking me out for some reason, but the video was worth it
Always been a fan of Tpain, it’s sad how he was treated, everyone did him dirty. Hope he is ina good place and way happier now.
Usher needs to stfu.. T-Pain MADE r&b. There wouldnt be r&b without him..
I mean Autotune is a big issue these days, because it is for a fact a cheap way to make music. Autotune itself is fine when u actually invest time in making it sound natural and just use it to make the voice sound even better. But the Autotune many artists use is just lazy production and most people who use a lot of this kind of autotune just want quick money. But Autotune itself is nothing bad, just the Industry uses it to make quick money because people don't really care anymore. Quality music these days most of the time don't get the attention it deserves, while cheap produced Summer songs get all the attention. Most of the time combined with a lot of cheap autotune.  It's not his fault people abuse autotune these days to make quick money and why would u blame him for other people who don't care to make good music or have their own personal style in music...i don't like his music for the most part, but at least he had his own style back in the days, other than most people today.  T-Pain didn't ruin music...Money did.
I think auto tuning voices as a corrective measure ruined music. T-Pain wasn't trying to be deceptive with his. The fact that Usher is coming out now is ridiculous; although, it is probably the best time since, unfortunately, Gen Z-ers didn't get to grow up with this legend.
14:00
WOKE HIM UP OUT HIS PEACEFUL ASS FIRST CLASS CABIN SLEEP JUST TO BE HATEFUL. BEYOND DISRESPECTFUL.
Honestly i would rather listen to T- pain then usher
"drums can sound bad," *St. Anger war flashbacks*
I think some people need to realize that auto tune isn't something that can just magically make someone's voice sound nice
I'm using this video to set up my new playlist
Brb, I'm going to listen to some T-Pain after this video...
Let's be honest somebody else would eventually popularize Auto-Tune with or without T-Pain lol
bartender is literally my favorite song in the world like that song never disappoints
I'm not a fan of overly auto tuned music. But if others like it, than why the fuck should I care?
You know it's correct when it's D'Angelo's opinion
That Willow Smith pluuuuuug!!!💕
d'angelo beeing the voice of reason and consciousness  restores my faith in humanity
now go listen to his new song " i like dat" featuring kehlani :)
Women singing with vocal cracks used to be written off pretty quick as bad technique ...then Sia made it her main thing. Same with T Pain, that's his calling card ...and I'd say T Pain has more relevance in pop culture anyway.
Not me thinking that D’angelo is wearing a concept for his merch
I fuck with ushers music but kinda after hearing he did that shit to t-pain makes me feel so bad bro, like I kinda don’t even wanna fuck with his music anymore cos he felt so entitled to say that shit lmao
I mostly listen to rock and heavy metal, TPain is a musician whose songs Ive always enjoyed.  And I loved him on the Masked Singer, he was one of the few people I actually instantly knew was under the mask.  Its very sad that he got so much hate for using auto tune.
Just cancel Twitter already
Music is literally subjective. How could one man simply ruin music lmao 🤣
Man this  makes me wanna fight usher now. Why doesn't he go make a auto tuned album about cheating on his girl for the 4th millionth time.
wait, did d'angelo really just forget about things like "i dont love you anymore"/"i want a divorce"/"you have terminal cancer" cause those are super effective 5 words or less sentences that give plenty of people depression >.>
Tpain is a big awesome teddy bear with a beautiful voice whose songs still slap all this time later. Can't believe Usher would do him like that. Can we even forgive him at this point?
I'm not usually a fan of the obvious "autotune" sound, even when used in what I assume is a great way by wonderful artists and producers. But I'm also not a fan of opera, and I'm not about to say that opera ruined music.  Imagine what a situation we'd be in if opera *had* "ruined" music. Hundreds of years of pain. :P
Where does Usher get the authority to say that? His only contribution to music was finding Justin Bieber and saying “Yeah” 50+ times.
ooooh not the usher who paid strippers "usher money" and didn't pay them actual fucking money that you use to pay rent and buy food
t-pain> usher ever before i watched this now T-PAIN > USHER
I feel like T-Pain pretty much earned the right to use autotune because he popularized it. The dude has an amazing voice without autotune, which you can’t really say the same for a lot artists who use autotune. The guy is super wholesome and chill as well and does NOT deserve this slander. Usher has no room to talk when it comes to other people ruining music anyway.
The background music sounds like music from The Untamed? Am I the only one hearing it?
didn't we cancel a guy for not liking Shrek?
You're right, it's not T-Pain's fault that auto-tune became the standard sound. It's everyone else's fault for copying his style. And I think that's due to the fact that today's generation is the copycat generation or "follower" generation, where everyone jumps on the same thing instead of trying to be original and stand out. I'm so thankful that artists in the 90s strived to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack. Imagine if Tupac and Biggie sounded exactly the same, ugh.
I'm neither an Usher nor T-Pain fan (just not into that genre that much) but I'd be hurt too if a friend sent a stewardess to wake me during a flight and then told me in my face I ruined what I'm passionate for? And that in a plane where you're more or less stuck with that person? Wtf dude
Never made a habit of listening to T Pain, but he’s always seemed like a cool dude from everything I heard. That’s pretty messed up of Usher.
Sideways made a really, really good video about autotune and T-Pain is in it. Basically, T-pain's "autotune" which is really just pitch correction, is just an effect for his music like a make-up!
Melodyne can preserve vibrato and inflections at this point. You don't know whether you're hearing pitch correction or not anymore. It doesn't make music it worse, it just makes it different. Music is not a competition, there shouldn't be anything wrong with going for the exact sounds you're looking for.
Naww T-pain came to my university in 2013 and i had a blast. He seems like such a genuine dude
Usher and his herpes need to stay in his lane 🙄
Usher mad because he couldn't compete.
I feel like T pain uses auto tune for stylization, therefore he isn't faking talent or making singing or music producing any easier.
I have (maybe) a good analogy of that classic “the straw that broke the camels back” saying. I was thinking it’s like getting a hairline fracture in your ribs, and then one day a friend whacks you while joking (lightly even); but because of repeated stress on the fracture, even though you didn’t have any massive accident to cause it, it was just enough to make the fracture break completely.
Sideways did an excellent video titled "The Problem With Autotune" that I highly recommend. So many ppl cry about Autotune but don't know jack shit about it
He said that really depressed him
Your own music 😌💗
Waiit is D'Angelo an undercover prolific producer bc why tf did he have all that knowledge? LOL
pitch correction is used so much in everything even in the ones that sound like they don't.
It sounds to me like Usher singled out T-Pain and tried to hate on him and make him feel lesser in some way, for creating something that ultimately became mega popular, and leaving his mark on the industry in a way in which Usher… really couldn’t ever hope to even rival in terms of ubiquity and achievement. Not saying Usher can’t sing, not knocking his talent, but I truly believe that T-Pain, outside of being a talented musician and singer himself, and I’m assuming having been around for even lesser time in the industry than Usher, by like what, 11, 12 years (unless I’m wrong on that estimation), to add insult to injury, did more to change the face of music and have a greater impact on the industry, with more immediacy and wider appeal, in a way indicating a success that Usher could only ever continue to hope to emulate. Sorry, but I’ve seen exactly one interview of T-Pain, outside of these clips shown here, and it was on a show about ghosts and psychics that my mom really likes to watch, and he was an absolute joy to watch and seems like such a nice person and a big ol sweetheart. Usher, however, in addition to sounding like a bad friend, also now just sounds like your garden variety hater ass narcissist, trying to dim everyone else’s shine because they think it makes them more successful somehow.
Peter Frampton used a tool to change his voice in the 70's. Usher is just salty.
When you mentioned zapp and roger I had to unsubscribe to resubscribe 🥰
Lmao usher gotta listen to mashup by tpain
Oh god T-Pain talking about Usher and their relationship broke my heart 💔 his music saved my life in high school, I love you T-Pain!!
T-Pain seems really wholesome, and he's very talented.
I did a cover of a song one time in a studio when I was 15 back in 1836, and they pitched my voice. That’s just how it works. I was extremely nervous so I made lots of mistakes (and that made me not want to go back). Some stuff they said I hit the right notes, others they had to pitch, some lines I had to redo. Looking back, it was a really fun experience! I got to see the editing process and everything. That’s how it is with everything recorded in a studio. So idk why Usher is pretending that autotune or pitch editing is something he himself doesn’t use.   And don’t even get me started on live pitching…
Like his jacket says
Lmao usher gave a girl an incurable STD never forget
Vocaloid, Utau and Cevio fans have entered the chat
"All this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question of your honesty" - Geddy Lee  Also for all my general dislike of auto-tune I always gave T-Pain a pass because he always used it as an instrument and not a band-aid for shitty singing like other artists. When you get down to it, what's the difference between auto-tune, and any other voice tool? Nobody's out here putting Daft Punk on blast for talk-boxing a synthesizer. They were one of the most influential acts in the business and everyone acknowledges it. Yet a talk box arguably has an even lower vocal skill floor. The reason auto-tune's name is mudd is the number of people who use it insincerely, as a trick to disguise. But the problem is not autotune, the problem is the insincerity.
Yall need to quit acting like buy you a drank wasn't a bop and sit down somewhere 😒
Saying using auto-tune ruined r&b is like saying drawing tablets ruined art -_- people need to use their thought hole
Bro why do people even care about auto tune why can’t we just enjoy the music?
He's a shitty artist.
How dare usher talk bad to T-Pain he's literally got no good music I listened to it nowadays and I'm sitting here cringing at what I thought was "good music" but my God Takashi69 was a think wacked out Justin beiber was a thing like wtf?
I haven’t seen anyone agree with usher. I am living for the usher dissing. The herpes, and usher bucks. I love auto tune, and why aren’t people who hate auto tune giving Kanye West shit then
Thanks to T Pain we have Moses Sumney & Leon Bridges xx
Usher needs to worry about ALL the women he burned without telling them when he knew he was riddled with STD's 🤢(screw Usher* but dear Lord not really)T- Pain is a great singer and a really cool guy!
"t-pain made r&b music BAD" ??? he didnt make that bad music????
Wait until Usher finds out about Vocaloid...
T-pain is the shit. His hits are garbage but most hits are honestly. His good shit is good and he’s pretty damned clever.
it's not like t-pain is coming into people's recording sessions and holding the producers at gunpoint to use autotune. people wanting to copy him isn't his fault
T-Pain x D'Angelo twitch stream when?
He literally went on that show and showed ppl he’s talented but did it for a sound
So basically you introduced me to some amazing music <3 ty kind sir *tips fedora*
Absolutely never!! His natural singing voice is perfection. He has impressed me over and over again with his talent. No hate whatsoever for using auto tune
Usher needs the cancelling. Look how he corrupted Justin Bieber.
Damn I hope T-pain watches this
T-Pain's TINY DESK SHOW THOOOO
As a guy who’s been recording in bands since I was a kid and talking to people all around, yeah everyone polishes vocals with tuning.
D'Angelo Wallace, i commend your ability to set the record straight. It Shows in your words, fact abiding videos and actions even if it means taking away from potential money. I appreciate you. i remember a few years ago and Ushers statements were making rounds on the internet and i must admit i agreed with it mostly because usher said it and other reasons. But in another videos you taught me its ok if i blindy ran with crowds and it also ok to change my opinion and out look. the worlds isnt black and white and its ok to change. TBH if you arent changing theres a problem. i love you D'Angelo!
Willow is goals
Anyone who's heard his NPR Tiny Desk Concert knows that man has a beautiful voice and the auto tune is merely a stylistic choice.
This was such a good video, truly 💖
Usher's jealousy jumped out period point blank. T-Pain's range of talent clearly goes beyond what anyone was ready for  and to see a "friend" surpass you can bring about an ugliness.
Im a music producer and I watch his streams, he is one of the chillest, sweetest, fatherly men in the producer community
Completely off topic: I just got an ad for Ad-blocker. Now THAT'S messed up
It’s not nobody fault t pain knows how to use autotune really well while still having a nice voice !! These other trash artists actually need autotune
T pain used autotune in a hella creative way that sounded good and not forced and his real voice is amazing !!
Thank you for making this honesty because this whole thing actually hurt my feelings lol. I have a lot of love for T pain from a nostalgia point because he blew up when I was in high school. Like we were dancing to t pain at prom lol. And I already loved him but I’ll never forget the day I saw his tiny desk concert and he just blew me away with his raw vocals. And I 100% agree that he just seems like such a nice guy and it’s like why would you go out of your way to make your friend feel bad. I don’t get it.
Who is the singer in his example of power? She did dhaat
also, it's like usher forgot the 80s existed. he's jealous . that's all
No. Using auto tune doesnt make a song bad, music is art. If an artist made something by editing different images together it would still be good art, it depends on whether they do it well.
I just turned 27. I've never had a twitter bc no thank you, but i'm fully prepared to make one to talk shit to usher.
has usher heard of sub genres???
t-pain is wholesome, sweet, and talented. usher can’t relate on 2/3.
Usher was lame yesterday and he’s lame today …yeah. Usher is a hater and he’s pathetic honestly
Usher needs to watch T-Pain's NPR Tiny Desk Concert.
lmao not you finding two tweets with a combined 264 likes and saying "this is cancel culture" ??? D'Angelo you're geriatric! like cmon the first tweet you showed sticking up for T Pain had 10x as many likes as BOTH of those neg tweets combined.. Calling this a "cancelling" is, by definition, wrong, and playing into the right-wing idea that cancelling is a thing at all. You could've come up with a less silly title, I just know you could've man
THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD VIDEO!
Also TPain is a vocal God #isaidwhatisaid
Wait, what?
I love T-Pain's real voice 💖
ushers a hater, tpain is a legend
Is that Serenade of Water in the background。。。? 👀👀👀👂🦻👂🦻
Also all singers use autotune, they just don't use it as an aesthetic and pretend they don't use it cause it almost seemless now.
EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING Jacob colier does freaking SLAPS!I can’t go a day without listening to him. “In My Room” and “Hideaway “ are God Tier amazing
Wait, they're doing this again
Cancel Usher
I LOVE HIM!!!! HE IS FAMOUS FOR HIS AUTO TUNE!!! Although auto tune can get annoying xD However he is not in charge of how other people ruined their songs with auto tune by assuming because it sounded good with him, it would with them too 🤦🏽‍♀️😂  I'm assuming that's what Usher meant 😁
Don't forget Tyler The Creator!🥰🥰🥰
Anyone watch Mask Singer? T-Pain won and had the most amazing voice! So he def can sing without it.
Imagine waking someone up just to tell them that they suck and "ruined" music.... that's so cruel... if anything Usher deserves to be "cancelled"
This was soooo sad
This reminds to try a find a vid where D'Angelo gives his fav music artists- I've been listening to pop for like 4 years and it is getting boring.... *well more than pop, but that's only cause my dad plays his hip pop and Latin music in the house*
The thing about t-pain is that he can actually sing like have you guys heard him without auto tune he just chooses to use auto tune
i haven't seen anything from D'Angelo since the pandemic hit, nice to see how far he's come and improved
“Am i the only one who likes how autotune sou—“ *phone dies* Well I guess my phone says yes, tho I disagree cuz I like autotune when done good
Me who doesn’t know who any of these people are: ah, yes. My favorite salsa dancers.
I wonder if the critiques on Twitter ever listened to “Computer Love”
You know denglow you really f|_|cked up youtube for real commentary youtubers
If it wasn’t for Usher, we wouldn’t have Justin Bieber therefore we wouldn’t have Yummy. I rest my case.
Even if the auto-tune boom could be traced back to T-pain, you can't blame him bc every one decided to copy him. Be angry about copy-cats doing his thing instead of their own. Edit: right after I typed this you said the same thing lol
Okay, but where did he get his hoodie?
T-Pain is a legend c'mon yall
I mean he just popularized it he didn't invent it while I do have my complaints about it mainly alotta singers seem to be unable to sing good without it all he did was stream line music and make it easier for artists to sound better the same way recording studios mixed music together to make an actual killer song if he didn't do it believe me someone else would of come along eventually to do it
I remember when Kesha first hit the charts and people who hadn't listened to her album would insist she cant sing like. Autotune as a stylistic choice is RAD. It can sound super cool and add a lot to the vibe of a song. Also the idea of people being mean to T-Pain makes me sad. Stop. He did nothing wrong. Gonna go check out Willow Smiths new stuff now.
I think the most offensive part is T-Pain IS a real singer. Nobody ever really got to hear it. He has a great voice.
nobody on twitter was canceling t-pain. if anything the overwhelming majority was defending him. you can make your youtube video on the issue wihtout lying lmao
I vote T Pain as the next Disney Princess
Tpain is iconic and a legend, it upsets me that usher sent him into a depression, he’s done so much good for music.
BTW, 1987 was incredible. 🤪
how shitty you gotta be to tell a "friend" that they ruined music just bc they do something different that you don't particularly care for? n the reactions...im not into r&b but i am into metal and i see this kinda shit all the time. this artist hasn't been good since the 80s, this kinda vocal styling sucks and everyone who does it is bad, good metal is bad, you're not actually metal you're pop. honestly like the twitter thing doesn't rlly surprise me bc ppl super into a certain style of music r hypercritical of anything that's not exactly like what they grew up with.
13:53  two random small artists idk
Whats that shamir song 13:22
Voicing your opinion shouldn't be putting someone down so you can feel better about yourself. And who the fuck wakes someone up just to tell them that their music sucks. Since WHEN did some of you guys become music critics, studied music AND graduated? T-Pain seems like a really nice person and didn't deserve that.
D’Angelo should make music
I’m still waiting for him to react to my queen Olivia Rodrigo-
Aside from being used as a vocal effect, what Auto-tune is really for is cutting down on studio time. It's like D'Angelo said, it won't hide genuinely bad vocals, it just corrects the pitch. And if the singer is way off pitch wise, the effect is more noticeable. Most of the time it literally just saves the singer from having to do another take just because a few notes were off.
When I was little I quite literally had a T-Pain mic that was for autotune   Like it’s his thing and we love him for it
What a hypocrite.  I don't know if he still does, but Usher used to sing like only every second line live because he didn't have the stamina to sing and dance and what he did sing didn't even sound comparable to his records.  Take it from a person who absolutely adored Usher and still listens to some of his songs and never liked T-Pains songs, because the use of autotune wasn't my taste. Not because I consider autotune as awful, his songs just weren't my taste.
Hit all the points, like always, damn. But also that D'Angelo's style is so good, where could I get that hoodie??
hyperpop is the fastest growing thing right now and relies heavily on voice changes/autotune/etc!!!!
You can pitch correct live performances now… Adele sounds amazing but like she could still be pitch corrected if she’s using a mic
simple correlation does not mean causation
Chloe and Halle are too good😭
I hate how many people misunderstand what auto tune is…like it doesn’t mean you can’t sing or aren’t talented it’s just a unique sound usher (and those who agree with him) need to stfu xD
Like why would you say that to someone  he seemed genuinely hurt....like ppl used auto tune for like forever. But T-Pain actually has an amazing voice but nobody supported like any of his other sht. And another thing...Stevie Wonder been did this type of music. He did a lot of that synth sound and altering his voice in his time. Listen to I just called to say I love you.
Sideways did an excellent video about "the problem with autotune" that goes into depth about this kind of view that "nyeh autotune ruined music" and rips it apart, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko
H.E.R, Sir, Frank Ocean, Giveon, etc. are doing great and are well known.
Is that hoodie your merch??? 👀👀👀
NOBODY hatin on T-pain today 😡
Oh no I get it. You see. T-Pain made music that was new. And therefore all old music has to die. Yes, very logical, you see, because T-Pain did something innovative and new with technology, all the other ways to make music are now illegal. We can't ever have music again. Guess we'll all perish. All because T-Pain did something new with art. Cause you're never supposed to do new things with art. Never. That'd be super wrong.
so... its just the internet being racist.... got it.
I totally forgot usher even exist
Everyone who thinks T-Pain can't sing should watch the masked singer. T-PAIN WAS ON FIRE🔥🔥 I personally didn't know he had such an amazing voice until that show
Ok D'angelo be lowkey recommending artists lol  Thank you!!!
Probably not the only person saying this but the channel Sideways has a great video on this topic ("the problem of auto-tune")
Every artist uses pitch correction now even sometimes live. People need to get over this stupid meme of "auto tune" tunning people. its supposed to yes but the way T-pain uses it isn't even the real settings. Do people forget vocoders exist?
You should check out some of Haywyre's music if you like edm and voice modulation. Examples: Endlessly, Do You Don't You, Sculpted, Wisdom, and I Am You.
he said eXpresso
but he has proven he can actually sing without it tho....
If it's twitter well im not even surprise lol
T-Pain is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 My biggest inspiration for music to this day!! Y'all remember Freaknik??? That special was so dope!  From '05 to 2021, I STAN T-Pain❤
Did he have the same conversation with Bieber?
The way he finessed in that willow smith ad was smooth as f—k
T pain a whole legend idc idc. Usher mad for what?? When he was telling that story I wanted to hug him so bad 🥺
Usher don't even write his own songs😒.  But I love them both
He’s a legit sweetheart
The people who hated T-Pain back in the day for his autotune were the same people who hated Justin Bieber for... being a kid. And hated Nickelback for... I don't even remember. Hating musicians for the most petty reasons was super common back in the 00's. There was no discourse about it, just petitions to send Justin Bieber to North Korea etc.
I love how many clips you put into the "things autotune doesn't fix about singing", point, I felt and learnt a lot in that minute
Usher wtf
Sounds like Usher is having some ego problems lol!
I really love ya but: You say that canceling is like a mosquito bite and not a cannon shot like people criticize/complain it is.... ... if it’s so innocuous then why waste time commenting on t-pain’s cancellation and “defending” him from a pointless and harmless act?
T-Pain is the 🐐
Self-care is key. Self-love is the most important. You are amazing and never forget that!
Art doesn't need to be justified, and T-Pain makes art. Usher's sounding a lil insecure.
i'm a hardcore punk so i have ZERO dog in this fight and lowkey no idea who these ppl are but this is fun to watch 🍿🍿 tpain seems like a cool dude
Lol the word that the person in the bathtub sang sounded like bajs aka the Swedish word for poop
Usher is an asshole but id just thank him for giving me so much credit and power over the whole world of music
And he’s pretty! Dang >:(
No. Pitch correction is not used I; basically every song. But it is definitely used in many songs, in varying degrees in different genres. But definitely in the vast vast majority of high production popular music etc
Such a well made video. Love the clips u used
Okay, not only is Usher morally sketchy, but he also needs to realize he's not Michael Jackson. He's a good singer, and I was a big fan when I was younger--I'll give him that. But what an outrageous thing to do to wake somebody out of their sleep to tell them they ruined music??   Edit: #GiveTPainHisFlowers
the willow marketing was amazing DANGELO HAS TASTE!!
T-pain doesn’t even need auto tune tho, I’ve hard him sing acapella and he still sounds good
Good autotune: T Pain, Imogen Heap, Waterparks in the song High Definition Bad autotune: Jason Derulo, N-Dubz (they're a British thing pls look them up they're horrible), Loick Essien
Your music taste and views on the world make me think you'd be best friends with my mum. Not saying you're like a 49 year old Afro Latina, what I am saying is that my mum has the vibe and music taste of a Gen Z music nerd. She introduced me to Prince, Lenny Kravitz, D'Angelo and Robin Thicke (I mean 2008 Robin Thicke), and in turn I got her into Jacob Collier, Twenty One Pilots, Harry Styles and Zayn.  Also yes everyone that blamed T Pain for this knows nothing about music. Also funny that they'll blame T Pain, a black man, when it was actually Cher, a white woman, who introduced that autotune sound into mainstream. It's like you said, if you're into James Taylor and Cat Stevens, y'all gonna say Hendrix fucked up music bc he plugged in a guitar? In fact, that famous Bob Dylan concert, when Bob plugged his guitar in someone shouted "Judas" from the audience bc they were angry about that.
i actually love t pain so much i will never forget when that one rapper confronted him on twt unprovoked
If D'Angelo was any better looking, I would start rotting by just looking at his angelic glow. We are unworthy
i was with you until you said pitch was the least important thing in singing.  Great vid!
I like how dAngelo put the weekend and Arianna grande as random small artists 😂
I know you won't see this comment but like. I appreciate your content man, I really do. This video was a blast to watch and I feel like this is great that it is on the internet. Somehow though, I can't help but noticing how close all the informations presented in this are close to the "Is Autotune a Bad Thing ?" Video of Sideways. The main points are brought up, just, more especially tide to the context of this interview. I don't want to say you plagarised them in any way, I just feel like, if you really did watch this video, I would have appreciated a shoutout to the guy, he's really putting his heart and soul in his content, and he puts up informative videos.
Sideways has a great video on the subject of autotune and its place in music and it dose bring up T-pain and his music. It is a really amazing video and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about Autotune and its history.
BS, fake artists have been using auto tune for ages. Tpain just used the technology and took it to a new level.
okay serious time: Usher felt threatened because of the power that t-pain had. He knew he was a trailblazer in the path of music and he had intentions behind his words when he had that conversation with t-pain. He knew what he was doing.
Says the man that used autotune on his song "oh my God" and "scream"? Usher!!! Take a damn seat!!!! No T-Pain slander will be tolerated.
When I saw T Pain in a video with Kurt zhugo Schneider, I did a double take.
Usher a flop
Here's the thing, he uses it on purpose and manipulates it's effects. Others use it to fake their voices to make them seem better than they really are. T-Pain is legit artist using technology to create a new sound.
Ursher can STFU
Usher is just mad he wasn't asked to say convict music in his songs lol
I may not like the auto tune sound as heavy, T pain really didnt ruin anything, and auto tune can sound good, it can be a tool for crazy cool innovative sounds.  Like stfu usher, music quality goes up and down and not everything is up to you
One honest guy recognized that his using auto tune, thing that has been used in almost all the songs of every artist since half a century but nobody has the guts to acknowledged it at all in that period. And he is the problem and he's ruining things, they say... Yeah.
Imagine waking up someone just to say you ruined music and then do the thing that "ruined" music 💀  The hypocrisy is astonishing
So no one has heard “drowning again” by t pain? Ok.
Don’t come for the genius who rhymed “mansion” and “Wiscansan” (Wisconson)
T-pain? Usher? What year is this?! Lol
this generation continues to cross the line of brainlessness each time a problem comes up, ugh
It's like people forget that you can simply just go back to the music you like listening too, BUT IF YOUR ON THAT PERSONS PAGE JUST TRYING TO DOWN PLAY THEIR MUSIC IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY  💀  Like you don't like them, stay away. You obsessed or sumthin 🤨 Cause I don't get why your coming back..   (there are some bad artists, I get that. And why do I use so much commas hbdnskjfhjdk)
who is this "we"?! aint nobody with sense trying to cancel this wholesome man😤😤😤😤😤
I see auto-tune as just an effect. Like chorus, delay, reverb, flanger etc. It's not my favorite but it defiantly has some cool stuff. I think Usher was jealous. Seeing his friend come up from a vocal effect he didn't know about. I've worked with musician friends of mine my entire life and I NEVER diss their music or style even if I don't like it. I might say "Well, i'd prefer to hear this or I'd do it this way" never would I say you ruined music. Gander & wiggle, baby.
Music is an art.  Different instruments are used to create different sounds. Guitar, drums, tambourines, etc. It’s the same as art. Artists use different tools to create a final art piece. Coal, paint, pencil, etc.
First of all usher stfu and leave t-pain alone. Second of all, stfu and leave t-pain alone. Third of all, stfu and leave t-pain alone. Fourth of all stfuuuu and leave t-pain ALOONNEE‼️ thank you for coming to my Ted-talk I hope you liked all my correct point
Usher sounds like one of them people that will constantly complain about "today's music" sounding so bad and then in 10 years, they'll play some Cardi B and say "oh this was the shit back in the day. Classic"
Omg I had totally forgotten tpain did that song best love song it was a hit
Petition to change his name to T Pleasure
Wow.  1 person ruined music.  So does this mean that music is so fragile that it can be ruined by ONE person/digital effect, OR, does it mean that T-Pain is just that powerful that he can ruin an entire art form?
There's nothing wrong with autotune. People use it on official tracks to make it easier to hear and communicate how it's supposed to sound. They also fuck with it to make music sound different, like T-Pain does. Some people make good songs but aren't very good at using their natural voice to sing it, so they use autotune so others can enjoy the music. Some people use it on stage through their microphones because it wouldn't sound right otherwise. There isn't anything wrong with wanting the music to sound good as long as you aren't lying about it. If you complain that an artist uses autotune on their official tracks, make your own music, perform multiple shows a day, wear out your voice, and then make a track that sounds godly without autotune. Some musicians use autotune, get over it.
How y’all gonna blame T-pain he gave us what we wanted he said it himself “I did one album straight singing and it went gold I did the next one auto tuned and it went double platinum what do you think I’m gonna keep making?”
T-pain over usher just saying I love t-pain for his amazing attitude
YES PLUG THAT WILLOW ALBUM
I bet the same people canceling him also listened to his music and is just trying to find a way to be different and quirky 😐
I hated his music at the time cause he came out Simpin but as far as auto tune he was just doing his thing, not his fault he had corny copycats
I liked this video a lot! Great change of pace!
What if Usher was told by publishers or whoever bankrolled him that he had to do the autotune stuff when he didn't want to because of T Pain's success? Tinfoil sadness hat.
I’ve been a huge fan of t-pain for years and people think I’m trolling when I say that. He’s talented and he knew what he was doing when he used auto tune. He created a unique sound and it worked for him.
LISTEN!!!!!! T-Pain did autotune so obscenely well. He made hit after hit after smash FUCKING hit! He shifted the music industry! How is it his fault if other people tried to recreate his sound and just made shitty sub-par songs? Leave that man alone. He is a national treasure and genuinely just a great human being.
not to be annoying but. t-pain is getting shit bc he said he wanted to work with tory lanez less than a week after he shot megan thee stallion. he also refuses to denounce r kelly and continues to praise him openly. he also defended xxxtentacion after he beat the shit after that one girl (this while he was still alive). he also ALLEGEDLY (!!!) beats his wife. that conversation came from a post where he threatened to kill his wife if she ever cheated  (some people think its a joke but a lot of people were like, that's a weird fucking thing to joke about). i didn't see anyone on twitter try to "cancel" t-pain for this usher thing just mostly support. then people looked into it more and were like hm maybe tpain isn't who we want to be hyping up this week.
i hope T-Pain sees this
It’s like everyone forgot the era of the “T-Pain” app where you could use the auto tune effect and make songs and post them. Lots of people did it and a whole bunch didn’t sound very good because the voice was untrained and off pitch before the auto tune was even placed.
"Drums can sound bad."  *St. Anger has left the chat.*
How is Usher not being the one canceled over this.
The fact of the matter is things change and evolve.. nothing stays the same forever.
13:50 you cant hear ariana if you are over the age of 30
omgg i love zap and roggerss computer love<3
0:15 Look at him! How could you cancel someone this joyful??? I'm tired of the T-pain slander! Give him his roses and let him live!
The video is just a fan vid for t-pain and I am here for it
Ummm…that’s what makes T-Pain, well T-Pain. People need to grow up and cancel the actual bad people who are still doing bad stuff
No I'm cancelling T-Pain over disrespecting the dead singer Aaliyah and her legacy.
N what has Usher been doin for the past 20yrs 🧐
TPain is such a genuine person and has great singing skill without autotune. Have you guy heard the song Drowning Again by TPain? Its beautiful
the "two random small artists idk" on the weeknd and ariana sent me istg 😭
Don't have a thing to say about Usher. Just struck by how mature, respectful, and classy (not to mention talented) TPain is.  10/10
usher's just mad because t-pain elevated pop r&b in ways he couldn't. usher had to hop on the trend t-pain popularized and his song can't even hold up. all t-pain's songs still hold up all these years later and impacted so many subgenres in ways usher never has or could. if anything the autotune is most likely there to protect us from his angelic musical powers and he still hypnotized a generation and all the while he's so humble and chill. usher could never.
The people who say there isn’t good r&b being made are the same people who only listen to the radio…
d'angelo i love you but no one is trying to cancel him they just have bad opinions
D'angelo why'd you have to mention that song from the Lego movie, I just got it out of my head 3 months ago 🤣
It’s crazy that usher said that to him. I listened to a podcast about t-pain and he is literally so talented. Usher can fuck off
T-Pain has opened so many doors within the music industry for both the electronic and rnb communities. If anything, he caused an incline in music. People just have to stop listening to a handful of bad songs and jumping to conclusions for whole ass genres.
I enjoyed this commentary a lot. I was recently discussing auto tune with some people, and I mentioned Cher's "Believe" as well as Roger from Zapp as pioneering the segment of music that is auto tune. Usher's comment wasn't delivered well, and he's contradicted himself as you mentioned. I'm glad T-Pain is sharing so that we can continue to speak about mental health and emotional intelligence in the Black community, in high profile industries, etc.
Dangelo when is the james charles one dropping yaaaaaaaallllllll😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
Lol why is anyone blaming artists and not record labels and audio software companies who spend the money to market and popularize trends and audio effects like auto-tune.
usher gave a whole bunch of women herpes, without disclosing his status, so i'm not sure anyone needs to listen to his opinion ever again.
you and ethan (h3) say "singing" the same
But like can we discuss T-Pain’s ACTUAL singing voice…. Because it’s absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!
not this clickbait ass title
As a timer/tuner who uses Melodyne I can assure you that tuned vocals won’t always sound obvious. If the vocalist has relatively good pitch then it’s hard to make them sound like robots. Tuning isn’t just autotune. If the raw tracks suck, it will show.
If you wanna find the best voice, have a singing competition. Auto tune just makes creating art more accessible. If you think that's a bad thing, I don't wanna consume your art.
how does one "ruin music" anyway?
Anyone blaming T-Pain hasn’t heard Cher
I like this video. I will absolutely be having no T-Pain slander. He can do no wrong. But, I do wish you'd played a little more devil's advocate in this video. While I agree with every point you made and Usher was being hypocritical and wrong for his statements, it is worth noting that he was coming from the point of view of another top charting singer. He was saying that he couldn't make it to the top without autotune because T-Pain had seen so much success with it and changed the expectations of the public. You mentioned that it was coming from a place of bitterness and I agree, but I think it was worth noting why he was bitter about it. He wasn't saying that music sucks now, he was saying that real singers couldn't succeed just off their voice and that even Usher himself had to use autotune to reach the same success that he was reaching pre-T-Pain.
Idk why this reminded me of hot tub streams
You tried cancelling someone for not wearing a piece of fabric so I mean
This is the dumbest thing ever!
Anyone that wants to cancel T-Pain is either a hater, or just lazily following the hate train... don't argue with me, or do IDC
I never liked artists that used auto-tune. But to be canceled is just wrong
If people wanted to cancelled everyone for auto tune so why only one singer? We should cancel every singer...
I'm Sprung especially the remix featuring Stat Quo is a banger. NO doubt about it.
Monsune is the king of rnb
First of all, T-Pain is an artist where Usher is a singer. Second, Usher is old. Not for his age, but for his actions. Also, I've heard stories over the years of him being entitled and not tipping service workers and took them with a grain of salt, but hearing he had a man woken from sleep and walked over just to bully him to his face is next level entitled and petty.  Also, loled at T-Pain taking time away from what he was doing to thank D'Angelo when he took several years to respond to celeb dms.
T Pain we LOVE your music & we support you!
As a person who's new to this topic, with this singer in question, I can say that he shouldn't be cancelled just for using auto-tune. If the songs are good & people like to listen to them, then why is this even an issue? I personally don't like auto-tune, but my taste isn't being discussed here. Let the man make music, I'm sure that this brings joy & purpose to more than just him :)
If you guys haven't watched The Masked Singer please do, he really shines with his singing and it's the reason why he went on the show. To prove he's far much more than being known for his autotune
Why usher out here talking shit like he ain’t at the strip club tossing fake ass dollar bills with his face one it with his broke ass! Someone come get ya boy and tell his ass to sit the fuck down!
holy shit t pain is godly
T Pain, proved his point when he won the Masked Singer season 1. (Mic drop)
Thanks for making this video 💜 We stan Teddy pin her ass down in this household.
Kanye's use of his voice as an instrument; large part because of his use of auto-tune; is an argument that auto-tune can be something creative.
Usher is one of my childhood loves but Buy You a Drank makes me dance and I dont care if its mostly autotune. T-Pain can actually sing very well. If anyone doesnt believe it they should go watch his NPR tiny desk performance.
wait until they hear about vocaloid lmao
I've got beef with Usher
Imma just point out that Usher was mentioned by NAME in bo burnham's repeat stuff 👀👀
I WAS SO SAD WHEN HE DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCENE, THANK YOU FOR COVERING THIS
Masego...athe first time I heard “Tadow” it was on loop for 4 hours, 😆
Doesn't usher use like auto tune all the time?
If someone woke me up to be rude to me...I would fight some one truly
oh god he looked so sad when he recalled that interaction w usher. BRO. I NEVER WANTED TO GIVE A GROWN ASS MAN A HUG SO BAD BEFORE jfc
I saw t pain at electric forest 2019 and it was amaaazing ♡
D'Angelo I want you to know dude, your content makes me so happy.  Seeing someone be critical but humane and open about learning and making mistake gives me so much hope and inspiration to be more forward, and call people out on their BS.  So thanks for making me happy dude
As you was listing artists I was sitting here just like, "WHAT ABOUT KHALID? SYD? ANDERSON .PAAK? BRYSON TILLER? I mean Tank still make music too." WTF are these people DEAF? Protect T-PAIN at ALL COSTS.
T-Pain is a music producer. He makes sick beats and can both write and produce. He deserves respect.
I absolutely agree with the fact that RnB  is its best right now like we have Masego, Smino, Berhana, and SiR? like come on now its great out here.
i think next we should cancel guitarists who use distortions 🙄
Your jokes are so subtle and funny. Sad for T-pain, he had me at the fan singing everyday.
T pain is the coolest and nicest man ever, I ran into him once and the experience was 10/10. His music SLAPS too
Auto tune is a skill.
T-Pain actually has pipes though. He'd got a great voice without autotune
Tallahassee Pain!!! 😄💕
Why did I only just realise it was transparent soul and not transparaside? What is transparaside? XD
Zoomers who finally found their mom's CD collection.
Usher be saying that autotune is ruining music as if the ENTIRETY of Raymond v. Raymond wasn't him trying his hardest to copy T-Pain smh.
I can't wait for the day when autotune haters discover vocalsynths.
U S H E R ?   The sweaty shoplifter?   The man who threw fake money with his picture on it … Usher Bucks … at a strip club?  Whatever, Usher. You’re gross.
I swear cancel culture will ignore the child predators, racist,  and other degenerates but will dox people for just living their life a little bit different. "T-pAiN rUiNeD mUsIc!" uhh...no he didn't. If you don't like his music, then don't listen to him and make him the center of your life. It's not rocket science.
Sir your skin looks especially smooth in this video ✨✨
Like you said, Giveon and Masego, but also Brent Faiyaz, Jeremih, Bryson Tiller, Miguel, Khalid... the list goes on
Usher literally woke this man up on a flight to tell him he fucked up music... are you okay, dude??? How rude of him. T-Pain clearly did something good or his music wouldn't have been popular
Cancel culture is unproductive, toxic, and a way for online bullies to feel important and part of the hype of ostracizing people because somebody doesn't like them 🤦 the only people who should be canceled are ped🤢phil🤮s and politicians
Anyone that doesn’t like or respect T-Pain needs to watch his tiny desk show. Dude is super talented and has a great sense of humor.
Its because it not real singing.. might as well be listening to AI perform its own music. Just dumb.
I am beyond ecstatic that Jacob C got a mention in this <3 <3
They say this to t-pain but not saying this to Kanye who popularized autotune in hip-hop (imo) girrrl😒
I will fight Usher for this. T-Pain is a blessing on this world and I will tolerate no slander against him.
if it wasn't t pain it'd be someone else
…are people really mad at tpain.. seriously are yall just now hearing of him cus hes been using autotune for years! Whys this an issue 😤
people don’t realise that, you gotta be good at singing to have good auto tune sound  edit: d’angelo said it oops
Hello, I am a millennial who grew up listening to various music including Usher and T-Pain. You know, whenever my friends and I or other people our age listen to music, we can sing so many bop songs of T-Pain: Bartender, Buy U a drank, take your shirt off, best love song, and apple bottom jeans, etc., but when it's Usher it's always My Boo and that's it. Sure he had a lot of bop songs, but can you believe that's the only thing we sing from him that we think is iconic????? He built his career for ages but that's the only song we can think of him that doesn't hurt our ears.. maybe bc Alicia Keys balanced things lmao. T-Pain until now gets his music turned into memes like the apple bottom jeans. Do you see any memes from usher? None. Because T-Pain is some god tier musician who chose to use autotune as his niche bc he knew there are other great singers out there and he wanted to showcase his music without being replaced by other singers in a few years. Usher was completely wrong for saying that because he never ruined music he made it fun. He was just butthurt that he never remained relevant as T-Pain was. As far as I've seen posts about T-Pain, he always gets hurt by his "friends" through betrayal or some sort that he was never respected to begin with since they only wanted him as a stepping stone in their careers. I'm actually glad this issue came to light because now we all know who to actually stan that's worth our money!    Also, I just recently discovered while in this pandemic that T-Pain can sing because his NPR Music live video appeared in my suggestions and I thank god I clicked!! Since then I kept listening to his songs and also made my friends listen and they loved it!! So Usher can shut up with his irrelevant ass because T-Pain is doing a good job with or without collaborations in his songs because he's a bop king!!
T-Pain must be protected always - watch his npr tiny desk
Do I particularly like the sound of auto tune? No not really. Do I think it ruins music? No. And I most definitely don’t think that T-Pain deserves the hate he’s been getting for years. He has a great voice and even if his music isn’t always for me I see how people would like it. He also seems like a decent guy so I dearly hope he is doing better.
I’m a sappy mom (who was college-aged during T-Pain’s “peak”) who is sitting here thinking how awesome your parents have raised you. Obviously you are your own person and I’m not going to claim that parents have 100% to do with a person’s character and what not, but they did something right because you are an awesome young man. I sound like an old fart and I don’t even care. You deserve everything amazing that is coming your way. Thanks for being you. That is all.  Edit: “like a Pokémon” 😆 as someone that has suffered from depression for…ever? That just sent me. i seriously love your humor. Thanks again for brightening my day just a bit.
Auto-tune is everywhere. It's even used during live shows. T-Pain happened to use an effect that exacerbates the effect of Auto-tune, but the man can actually really, really sing.  Also, wasn't Usher like everyone's crush for a while? Can't really blame T-Pain if Usher's own fans got bored of him.
The ironic thing about your rock analogy is that this exact criticism happened to Bob Fucking Dylan. One of the best musicians and song writers and when he went from acoustic guitar to electric Folk music fans started claiming he ruined folk music and began turning on him. For simply wanting to try something new in the genre. So yeah that analogy isn't too far out
There's a difference between some random jealous hater saying you ruined music and a friend you respect and whose opinion you take into consideration
Its alarming how many people don't know that Auto-Tune is a musical instrument. Makes it a lot easier to separate from regular singing when you consider it's literally a completely separate musical instrument, it's like saying viola ruined the violin... like, no ?
Music is subjective so either way I don't think a singular person could mess up the music industry as a whole
I believe Sideways also did a pretty good video on why the T-Pain hate is silly.
T-Pain is an ANGEL. It’s not his fault that he started a trend - I mean.. The fact that he started a trend of autotune just shows how influential his music is. He’s genuinely such a sweet guy and he doesn’t deserve any of the hate he’s getting ):
Besides the auto tune, he can genuinely sing. Remember that video of him singing the national anthem without it?
Can u just be president at this point
I'm going to reveal myself as an old person now -- hello -- but all of you who are currently obsessed with the garbage way female artists were treated in the 90s and 00s need to look into the Cher thing more. Not sure if you'll be able to find videos and articles because it was a time of dubious digitization. People were already using auto-tune, but Cher thought it would sound fun to make it more obvious. People in the industry were SO MAD at her! They did not want the public to know about auto-tune. She was basically, "I'm a living legend, so sit down." There was even a TV special about how Cher broke music. THEN people started blaming Cher for "all these horrible singers" who put out albums in the next couple of years, singers like Britney Spears. There was so much trash talk about how "kids today" don't appreciate good voices because we'd all been tricked by auto-tune. People were out for Britney's blood at her first note.
T-pain is the best person and an amazing singer with or with out auto-tune. It’s not his fault. Usher needs to get off his high horse. Singers can make there own decisions to sing with or without auto tune lol
I didn’t know this type of elitism existed I’m the R&B community. I guess every genre has that whole “this era was better” community. Can’t we just enjoy the music we like and stop getting pissed off at the stuff being released after? Like girl, is this causing irreparable damages to your life?? Christ. Auto tune is normally in any mainstream song nowadays... all respect to tpain, super talented guy—but like putting it all on one person is soooooooo foolish. Smh. Would people say Britney Spears ruined pop if everyone started singing like a baby in the 00s too....well yeah, but can’t you see how stupid that is?!
his stream with CodeMiko is precious
I'm sorry, but was Usher singing 'Im on a boat'? I don't think so, bro needs to take a moment to appreciate T-God
alright well, you've converted me into  enough of a t-pain fan that i will go actually listen to his music bc it sounds nice in these clips (my music taste just never really got into a lot of r&b or rap or hiphop just for whatever reason, never claimed to dislike it tho) not sure if i care for usher tho lol that was so rude ... like waking someone up on an airplane ... just to say that ... when yall are considered friends like wtf anyway, i'll go now listen to some T-Pain for the first time thanks D'Angelo
T-Pain doesn't get the credit he deserves for fucking any of his music. Epiphany is such a bold, unique and joyful album. His singing is great there with or without the autotune, even a track like church which is him spitting on this Atlanta 2000 ass track about beating the shit out of people just sounds happy, he also has an entire track about getting HIV and dealing with what's next which I don't know if the man is HIV+ or not, but to be that open about it in a scene like hip hop, and to talk about it to a crowd of people looking to party is brave and important too. Also, Tummy is a goddamn beautiful song, no fucking explanation required it's just a banger. Anyone who thinks T-Pain ruined music knows fuck all.
Usher must HATE Vocaloid lol
It’s literally just laziness when people write off an entire generation of musicians as bad because of one musical trend. Music isn’t ‘ruined’, you’re just too lazy to look for music that you enjoy
D'Angelo is spitting straight FACTS. This analysis of music is brilliant. Music is ever-evolving and you can't blame ONE PERSON on how it evolves. Usher is trash for that comment. T-Pain is a gift and can sing his ass off. I was so surprised by his voice listening to his Tiny Desk Concert. He's great and mental health is real. Leave him alone.
people can make music however the fuck they want its THEIRS and it's ART and if you dont like it, well good, you don't have to, stfu. autotune is a tool that MANY artists use, not to make their voices better, but to make it something different. homies just mad because t-pain can sing well but still chooses to make music the way he wants to, with autotune. jealousy.
I loathe auto tune vocals but the “customer is always right” means exactly this - if the audience wants it then it has a legit place in the line up.
personally, i’ve cancelled TPain because he defended XXXTentacion’s abusive behavior and he’s just pretty misogynistic in general lmao
As a guitar player + audio prod student, the amp analogy sort of works, but the “pedal analogy” is more applicable— you can alter the sound of your guitar, and different sounds work well for different stories. Same can be said for Photoshop, even professionals and talented people use it, but you can easily tell when it’s used poorly. I agree that they are definitely tools and it just depends how you use it.
Let's not forget how important autotune is for trans individuals to get their voice in their music to match how they would like to be perceived
T-Pain can literally sing the fucking shit out of anyone and anything WITHOUT autotune. I guess no one knows how beautifully talented he is??
At 0:28 when he mentioned bad bunny my heart went📈
If you hate overly auto tuned songs, Lemon Demon  If you love overly auto tuned songs, Lemon Demon  seriously guys, lemon demon is amazing
I personally think that the worst part is that he was woken… awaken? I dunno! The man was asleep then he wasn’t just to be told by his friend that he ruined music. Like shit couldn’t he wait for him to wake up before crushing his soul?
I think T-pains comment about not hating usher speaks alot to his character seems like a super nice dude and I'm glad hes still around
I grew up with T- Pain... He was writing and recording music on a cassette recorder back when we were in 7th grade and it was good.
thank you for that willow music in the middle of the video king ! i love u !
You meant sonically pleasing, not aesthetically pleasing. ❤️ awesome vid!
music channel?
T-Pain was literally my childhood. You disrespect T-Pain's godly voice, you're disrespecting my childhood. I WILL fight you for that.
The man This a whoel mess, and the ppl clall in out his abusive tendencies gettin put under the bus.  haaa...
Speaking of auto tune music that slaps, can we all just appreciate GLaDOS’s two hit singles?
Usher shut up
Wait until Twitter finds out about Roger Troutman.
T-pain was a visionary, and also his production skills are god level too. People just like to jump into whatever discussion is happening and try to pick a side based on what they think is most popular / profitable for them to side with
How is anybody going to gatekeep art? Expressing yourself? How dare anybody think there’s a wrong, or right way to express yourself through your creativity.   Imagine if artist like Hendrix, Little Richard, and Prince listened to the naysayers of their time..   Everybody is a critic, but hate when the tables are turned, and they’re under that microscope. It’s all subjective anyways.   Ppl hated Lil B, and couldn’t understand what he was doing.. now? So many have followed his blueprint.   Ppl hated on Young Thug, and Lil Wayne.
soo lemme get this straight usher - listening to mumble rappers is cool but we mad at someone for singing with auto-tune lmao if you don't like it then don't listen to it!
Seeing him on the Gus and Eddy podcast made me love him. Such a genuine nice guy
He an abuser
This is like cancelling Soulja boy for using the internet to promote his music. T-Pain created a wave, everyone is on that wave.
Computer Love is still 🔥
If y’all don’t even know the difference between auto tune in pitch correct just please shut up…
T Pain has made very problematic statements about women who have been abused, most notably in regard to Meghantheestallion being shot by Tory Lanez.
Love this video! T Pain is the best
Thank you for this!!! TPain deserves better.
Even though I'm not a fan of super heavy auto tune I know it has done a lot for the music industry. It can give certain effects! And seeing what people do with it now is so cool
Music hasn’t gotten bad, y’all are just bad at finding good music lol
People also said that digital art is much easier and ruining traditional art, but both use a crazy amount of skill to make it look nice.
i feel like people are only agreeing with usher because they grew up with 90s rnb and now have huge egos when it comes to the era they grew up in. they all cuss out good music made in this era because it is  new and is slightly different to theirs all because they can't move on and accept that the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s weren't the peak of all humanity and every singer back then was not God on earth. you even see them commenting on modern rnb and rap artists and comparing them to beyonce, usher, tupac, and wonder why they can't just enjoy the song 😭 also how can they blame t-pain's good use of autotune for the creation of things like 100 gecs or some shi like clearly its not his fault that people took autotune and nonsensical lyrics and ran with it. maybe its just the fault of those 'bad'  artists and not always the people before them. ok i'm done ranting thanks for coming to my TED talk :))
someone pls greatly improve my life by telling me what song Shamir is singing at 13:22- or what video d'angelo pulled that from omg
People are fucking stupid. This is why I avoid twitter at all costs
“Two random small artists idk” DANGELO NO LMAO
I feel like this whole comparison is apples to oranges. T-Pain never struck me as someone who was using auto-tune to make his voice sound better, he was deliberately distorting it as an aspect of his style. It wasn't in any way subtle. To compare him to singers who are trying to make their voices sound "good" in a more traditional way I feel is unfair. They are using auto-tune in a completely different way to achieve a completely different result.
I love you D’angelo
Love your channel my man
I sure hope he sees this
i think that highly autotuned singing is a very cool vibe and i have found a great many songs like that i greatly enjoy blasting my ears out with that heavily use autotune because its cool music
T-pain is an icon I will not tolerate disrespect. Also, I hate the idea that auto tune automatically makes music bad, means an artist can’t sing, or that there is this mythical rise of bad music that is cancelling out good music.
"pitch isn't important"  Arnold Schoenberg: *agrees*
It’s true that we never forget how someone else made you feel. T- Pain didn’t deserve his criticism, he sounded hurt.
i hope you're making video about atypical and it's ableism as you did to music?
T-pain opened the trash door to let mumble rappers and SoundCloud "artist" in! I work with someone who does "live performances" and knows he sucks but doesn't care because he has autotune.
I'd like to bring some attention to vocaloid technology. You can make an entire amazing album of music from a small vocal sample. If you like the sound of auto-tune, you may enjoy listening to music produced using vocaloids.
bruh where can i buy that hoodie?
Usher was hating that his music was on the decline and Tpaynes vibe was up coming. So messed up how he projected his fears of change onto  him
If you ain't gotta voice,,,,Otto-toon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!!!!,,,,roflmao@wannabevocalist,,,,,,Either your born with it,,,,or Otto-Tune,,,,,,
T-pain was and still a Legend. I don't hive a F what people think about him using autotune. I swear this generation doesn't know what else to cancelled.
Maybe people getting so angry ahouod just stay in their lane. Different music different interests.
T pain sucks
good to know that d'angelo has music taste. stream willow!!
His music was such a vibe tho
First of all: I’m convinced Chloe is like a magical being that floats the earth. Like has anyone REEEEALLY witnessed her presence? 🤨🤨
T-Pain actually has a great voice that does not need auto tune. He used auto tune to be different and make a new interesting sound to his music.
By this logic Lil Wayne ruined music. Now try to convince him, the fans and even me that it true. First off Usher I'm sorry but who? Now im from the 90s Usher had some hits but he has lost his place in music. It was just easier to blame Tpain then admit that he lost the ability to be creative and continue to set himself apart now that he not singing about cheating on woman.
Usher  saying T-pain ruined music but he ruined the life's of God knows how many women, by knowingly giving them herpes.
T-Pain is the ONLY auto-tune person I like because it's so obvious that it just becomes a style choice.
I think T-pain has a better voice than Usher.
Isn’t T-pain a fan of Gus Johnson? T-pain is aYouTube watcher there’s no doubts he’s gonna see this
also wanna bring up arlo parks in the r'n'b area cause YES
All auto-tuners should be cancelled, because it’s a terrible trend that should die. :)
when i was a kid i absolutely loved black eyed peas and Tpain i realized when i was older is who won my heart over. literally love tPain and the fact hes been on twitch is amazing. always rolling with the times uwu
i’ve always loved t pains music and when i was a kid i enjoyed hearing the auto tune i thought it sounded cool and amazing.
Isn't this litterally what people got mad at him for back in his prime as if that wasn't just his gimmick?
Can D'angelo bless us with the whereabouts of where he purchased his hoodie from....cause it is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!
But the thing is, people like “overuse” of auto tune. Why else would it be so popular? We’re angry at someone for setting a trend everyone likes
T-pain can actually sing. But the auto tune provides his own sound. It brought something kind of different.
no one “ruined music” music cant be ruined there are songs you don’t like but it hasn’t ruined music. T-Pain being criticized for using autotune is so stupid like maybe we should start blaming electronic dance music and say it’s ruined music. the entire argument is stupid.
the way he didn’t mention miku….
#41 on trending? move it to #1
Didn’t usher contract aids and then not tell any girl he had sex with after knowing?
D'angelo...i love you so much bro. But seriously, all the elements you mentioned with the singing...all have to do with the pitch. if ya pitch ain't correct, it would absolutely sound shitty as hell. That being said, I sing. I don't think autotune is a bad thing at all...I personally prefer low autotune, since it does add a robotic feel, and I do think it takes away from the voice given to me. Pitch is the fundamental thing...if a person is popular because they can't get their pitch correct, and decide to use autotune, then it does feel unfair to people like me who have worked their whole lives to be mindful of the pitch and tone...I don't think what's happening to T-pain is fair, since I do think he has revolutionized Autotune, and Usher saying that was absolutely rude. I think the middle ground would be that the person has a good pitch, and uses autotune for specialized affect...pitch is the fundamental of singing.
Please make a video about creepshow art
Usher needs to shut the fuck up he ruined his lips with them fuckin herpes😂
Lmaoooo ok so what he uses auto tune 🤣💀 his actual voice slaps too 🤷🏽‍♀️
T. pain, He's such a handsome soul not talking about his voice Usher is just f***k jealous of him🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱❤️❤️❤️
Omg ur inclusion on chloe and both her ranges was everything
if you want to hear more abt autotune + t-pain highly recommend sideways’ video “the problem with autotune” !! it hits on a lot of the same points but goes a bit deeper into common criticisms of autotune and how pitch correction works
Snoop dogs song sexual eruption with auto tune is still one of my favorite song.
T-Pain does use a lot of autotune, but so does everyone in the industry. The only difference is how noticeable it is.
I honestly had no idea that t pain was getting shit these days. In the reddit and other circles I hang out in, everyone basically says t pain is a ludicrously good artist, they always drop his videos where he sings live without the autotune and fawn over how ridiculously good he is, and also everyone absolutely love his livestreams where he's basically just being awesome and living his best life, and also utterly destroying racist gamers. Hearing that he needs defending is kinda shocking to me!
A better analogy is the use of computerized sounds rather than live music. No one cares anymore.
ok but, can I please get a curated, D'Angelo approved spotify playlist?
Just listened to Willow's song Transparent Soul....and oh wow I'm hooked!
Imagine getting woken up by your contemporary and being told you're shit. Wtf.
You can tell he just didn't want to talk about it. 😒😔 But I'm glad he said something.
Honestly I feel so bad for T pain. It absolutely crushes you when your friend just tells you your not good at something. I used to do local stand up weekly but was never able to recover from the same thing.
I would also like to add to the evidence actual legends: Daft Punk and Chromeo who have been changing the pitches of their voices for YEARS
I was very pleased to see Chloe
I was WAITING for Dixie to pop up in this video-
Cancel D’Angelo..... he said ... “expresso”
why does it even matter if the musician making the song isn't a good singer. if it sounds good, and the song is well written, then why does it matter??? music purists are so fucking annoying
D’Angelo is someone i’d want to have a class with and secretly hope to be assigned a project with and eventually become best friends
People who say he fucked up music obviously don't understand music production or what autotune/melodyne/etc even does. Those plugins aren't going to take a bad singer and make them sound great. As D'angelo said, you'd be extremely hard pressed, especially in pop music, to find a single track or artist that doesn't use some form of pitch correction software (not even mentioning the huge amounts of other processing that goes on to make vocal tracks fit into a mix).  T-pain was an innovator in the sense that he took the tool of pitch correction and applied it as a musical effect (similar to an effect pedal on a guitar) to differentiate himself, and it WORKED.
How y'all cancelling him over his niche. Like auto tune aside have they heard this man's real voice...so it's not like he can't sing
ok but can we talk about hayley williams?!?!?!????? the best singer imo
T Pain ain’t a musician, he’s a fucking genius. He’s just a great guy too.
Usher WISHES he had a song that hits the way that “buy u a drank” does 😤
YOU would feel weird saying a mean, extremely hurtful, subjective thing to someone. But people said the exact example you gave to Bob Dylan with FERVOR.
T-Pain is a great singer, he LITERALLY has a great voice. Listen to him on Tiny Desk
This whole thing is stupid tbhc
I can only imagine how much people shit on him for the autotune. Hell I used to talk shit in my youth about how blatant autotune sounds awful... I feel for him though, not only from hearing that from another  successful artist but also carrying that specific criticism with him. Well fuck that, because we got to hear him sing for real on the Masked Singer and he's amazing! Usher sounds like a fucking hater, because real singers no matter what will be recognized, like you are not about to diminish Mariah Carey's singing talent or Ariana Grande's because autotune is being used by other people in their own music. Like neither of them are suffering because T-Pain uses autotune... EDIT: How can he listen to Sprung and think he ruined music, again Usher sounds like a hater!
Not Mr. Baby let me love you down there's so many ways to love ya, Mr. UshBucks, Mr. Cooties Bump spreader saying King Pain ruined music.
Maaaan, you gotta be next level stupid to think T-Pain ruined music bc he used autotune.
I prefer Waves Tune to Melodyne
Usher is just mad because he's not relevant anymore.
I'm so happy you're happier! Continue to do the content that YOU wanna do and brings you joy cause at the end of the day that's what's most important!
What people fail to understand with music is it’s unlimited in terms of you can do anything and turn anything into an instrument. If you don’t like the artist/song, then don’t listen to it and explore other artists music, or find something that works for you. I love Auto-Tune personally. I don’t care how “talented” you are or are not, music is your art. Like photography, painting/drawing, how you view your “art” should be all that matters. Love your art. Just because others don’t doesn’t mean there isn’t people out there who do appreciate it.
The fact that i liked usher... Wtf?
The fact that Usher didnt even have the guts to wake him up himself and got a stewardess to do it while he cowered waiting in a corridor or smt really tells you all you need to know
T pain must be protected at all cost
There is enough music and range for everyone to find something they like. Even if they break out of what they listened to in their teens and twenties and spend every week listening to Spotify discovery. So I don't get why people need to attack artists for doing something they don't like?  I don't particularly like slow songs, I like fast songs, but I don't think slow singers ruin music 😅
Listen, even though I'm not a fan of auto tune and Tpain definitely doesn't need to use auto tune because he has a beautiful voice, he did not ruin music. What ruined music is mumble rap, people just saying random stuff in music in general, that's what ruined music.
As a photographer I STRONGLY agree with the photo editing app tweet and comparing it to T-Pain. That video broke my heart and I hope he continues making music again.
Aww. Usher needs to get his head out of his ass. How could he just say somthing like that?
Is he wearing bee-angelo merch?
Ngl if someone, especially a “friend”, woke me up outta my sleep to say that I would flick them between the eyes and walk away. Cuz if we are on the same flight you can talk to me afterwards. Plus he was a yes mann until he fell off but then released a song full of auto tune.
Had to comment about being woken up….. like bitch I don’t care if someone wants to talk to me, if you want to ask me if I want food, or the plane is going down… don’t wake me up.
Dude T-pain changed the game for everybody
Tpain is an amazing songwriter, yes he us autotuned, but he wrote and produced most of his songs himself. He's an amazing musician, and usher has used autotune many times, he can't really talk.
Usher USES AUTOTUNE
T pain can sing. He uses auto tune and rocks it.  Usher can not like it and that’s fine but that is rude as fuck. Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it’s bad. If someone uses auto tune that’s not on t pain.
didnt usher use auto tune on his song OMG tho ???  edit: yea i was right LMAOOO.
If we're appreciating T-Pain, let's not forget he's legit funny as well. To the point of getting a show and multiple appearances on Adult Swim.
Autotune and Pitch correction are different things. I like the way autotune sounds when used correctly. It's yummy
T Pain is a real one. He hosted Karaoke at Bonnaroo 2 years ago and though I did not attend I was lulled to sleep by the sound of him hyping up the crowd from the campgrounds. I hope he comes back so I can go but it was scheduled for like 3am
i just gotta point out, "two random small artists idk" lmfao
Lol if usher wanted to complain about who made the robotic sounding use of auto tune popular….wouldn’t he need to confront Cher? 😂
Aww I had no idea T-Pain was so nice! Bruh all his songs hit different 🙌
Great video this was amazingly put together.  Although I don’t agree with you that pitch is one of the least important things in singing, I also think that it doesn’t mean you can’t sing if you don’t always hit a note perfectly.
I can understand how T-Pain felt having a friend say something like that you. To make a long story short, when I was in high school, I had friends who would always compliment my art work when someone else noticed me drawing and praised my work. After graduation, I dealt with a death in the family and I was pretty vulnerable and emotional. Those so called friends of mine admitted to me that they thought an Artist career was silly and unrealistic and that I should stick to a 9-5 job. I already had family members putting me down as an artist but to hear it from my friends, really hurt my self esteem and discouraged me from drawing. My friends were toxic and I'm glad they're out of my life, but the death and my shitty friendship really took a toll on me as an artist. I am doing better now but idk why I'm still afriad of picking up that pen to draw again.
This is like saying photoshop ruined photography. It only does when people lie and say #nofilter #nophotoshop and you can clearly see that yeah its been edited🤣
Willow Smith still exists in music??
He pronounced espresso as expresso.
Everyone who bashed auto tune have no idea what autotune is. T Pain can fucking sing
A friend of mine showed me the clip of tpain singing without autotune and it changed my mind about the artist and the autotune tool.
ok and the last thing we heard about usher was that he was giving out fake money at a strip club…..TACKY
Honestly, if you woke me up from a peaceful sleep to tell me you thought my music was shit. I would look them in the eye and say "you really woke me up for this??" Leave and go back to sleep. Music is personal and preferential. Someone waking me up to tell me their opinion would honestly be more offensive than whatever they said to me. Also if usher is talking that much smack to you... he's not a friend. Focus on the fans.
Except T Pain is actually an incredibly gifted musician. Have you seen his tiny desk concerts?!
sideways has done an amazing video on autotune talking about it from the perspective of a professionally trained musician! and he does in fact call out the bullshit attacks people put on tpain https://youtu.be/05hTQC1CZko
It is so wrong and unfair to blame him for the death of music. He is not the one to blame. At least not the only one. A lot of people and mainly the USA industry is to blame.
Welllll Usher ruined... all of his relationships bc he's a lying cheater so... we all have our issues don't we?
Sounds to me like Usher is just mad because the last time he was in the news it was for paying dancers with “usher bucks”💀💀
T-Pain found a tool no one was really using, sharpened it, and everyone tried it out. There was a flood of 'not good artists' but that's because they weren't refined in using the tool. He opened the way for people using a new flavor in their recipe.
The funny thing is he can sing
Just admit this whole video was so you could tell us T Pain said thank you to you 😂😂🖤🖤
it's so dumb because t-pain uses auto-tune as a stylistic tool and not to cover up flaws in his singing like several popstars do. I wouldn't even go after the popstars for using it because I don't want to hear shitty singing on a record.
Imagine someone waking you up to not just go talk to someone, but to go listen to them blaming for something stupid. That is absolute pain
I'm so sorry you've been struggling with mental health lately. It means a lot that you still upload content for us! These videos are so incredibly enjoyable. Thanks for sharing your light with the world :) and for all of the incredible T-pain clips.. damn his voice is perfection..
Does anyone know what the background music is from in D’Angelo’s videos on this channel?
The old band Zapp BEEN using autotune
I’ve vibed out to T pain since 2005 and I still Spotify his songs. Much more so than usher. Usher is starting some random drama. He will probably drop something soon
I always loved T-Pain, he seems like such a genuine person and so kind. He deserves so much better
How terrible do you have to be to be someone's friend, wake them up from thier sleep and day that to them. How horrible do you have to be
Lets pretend ppl have not been cancelled for something wayyy stupider...
2 random small artists idk lmao
Even if you want to argue that Auto-Tune ruined music, T-Pain just used it. It was invented for Cher.
I caught him streaming ringfit and it was adorable
Bruh T-pain *is* autotune
LMFAOOO I WAS JUST SITTING THERE W MY MOUTH HANGING OPEN WHEN HE PLAYED THAT CLIP OF CHLOE DAMNN 😩😩😭😭🤞🏽
I want t pain and usher to see this video.
T-Pain - Teddy Pinned'erassdown - The Earworm King!
9:41 facts
The willow promo lmaoooo
Attacking T-pain!? I have officially lost faith in humanity
Congrats on trending, and thanks for introducing my uncultured soul to T-pain’s wonderful music!
What Usher said wasn’t “real” or even necessary, it was mean as all fuck. Autotune has been around since the goddamn 80s. Zapp and Roger, Cher, etc etc. And thanks to autotune Travis Scott has a career, Kanye gave us 808s and Heartbreaks, and many many more examples. Put some respect on T Pinned-her-ass-down!!!
You out here hooking me up with music bro thanks
Years ago I watched a video of Tpain without auto tune and I was literally amazed. Auto tune or not hes super talented
HERE for the Masego shoutout 🙌🏽
Uhmmm not here for the t-pain slander
Bro u were talking shit about bts cuz of the autotune in their songs .....
D’Angelo saying “singing” like Ethan Klein lololol
9:42 thank you 🙏
I don’t understand people. This makes me so sad 😭 T-pain was one of my childhood favs. He made so many jams
who are those two random artists ? never seen them in my life crazy .. anyways 🤪
look at how metal singers deepthroat the mic to get a different sound with their voice, the voice is an instrument
Usher is that dude who hates techno cuz he Wants credit for knowing how to play an instrument
T-Pain has the voice of an angel
yall zoomers dont remember when vocalists used to need talent and voice training
so Usher woke this man up to tell him that...... smh
Tbh you have to be a “real” singer to sound good with auto tune anyway.  People didn’t criticize Cher for using using auto-tune because everyone already knew she made a name for herself without using it.  Just because T-Pain came out the gate experimenting with the program, doesn’t mean he EVER needed to do that, it was purely an artistic choice. If karaoke Karen tried to sing one of T-Pain’s songs and someone tried to use auto tune on it it wouldn’t sound nearly as clean, or even pitch correct in the same exact way in some spots.  You have to sing in a very intentional way to get the program to hit your voice in a way that sounds good, and amateurs don’t know this.
god i love tpain. there’s no need to cancel him for some stupid crap like this.
We would not HAVE good autotune music if it weren’t for TPain. 😭🥲
Ppl who say T can't sing need to watch his Tiny Desk Concert. No autotune whatsoever. I love him. He's a really good singer, a charismatic dancer, and a super sweet and positive guy. Usher, on the other hand, is a self absorbed jackass
why arent they canceling usher for causing t pain a 4 year depression 😭😭💀
If he didn't popularize it someone else would have and T-pain is bomb.
Love T-Pain 💖
Wait till this man finds out about Vocaloid
t pain genuinely has one of the most beautiful voices to come out of the industry. auto tune or not, he can SING
I’ve always like T-Pain! He brought auto tune back and also, the man can truly SANG! And he is AMAZING live! The man is talented and has mad hits under his belt! Fuck Usher
Nah its cause y'all are old and dated, and whining about it doesn't help your image.
D'angelo no offence but if i didn't know how you sounded i wouldve immediately thought you were lesbi just ny your thumbnail
it's not a perfect example, but saying heavy autotune is "ruining music" is like saying hatsune miku and other vocaloids are "replacing singers". human singers still exist, even after over 10 years of vocaloid's existence and improvement. both types of singers can co-exist, just like songs with and without heavy autotune.
You were absolutely correct about all of this. Another creator called Sideways did a video about auto-tune about 8 months ago that might be helpful for people to understand more of the history and how a lot of artists use auto-tune today. He was also very frustrated that people try to say that T Pain can't sing.
you know if you ever want to sit around and talk about Cher, i can't see anyone complaining
I’m 25 and still slap TPain, especially that gorgeous mashup he did a few years back…. You know who I don’t bump to… usher 😂
LOL I feel sad for peaple sucked in by social media and you just don't get record deal,s with out taking it deep elites run the show Satanist agenda shill inc. LOL usher and puffy sitting in a doing nasty things woo,wee,,😜😷💩
I unliked this video. Just so I could like it again.
He actually sounds really amazing w/out auto tune that he doesn't need it.
Ah! Love seeing you pop up on YouTube! Even my 1 year old ran over and was screaming “hi!!!” And pointing at you. 😂
Love Shamir!
i disagree with this so fucking much. t pain could actually sing but the autotune added a some flare to it--it was his own spin. the music industry ruined music. t pain was not the only person using autotune at that time and they used it on people who couldn't sing (as in the autotune was helping them sound good; t pain sounded good without it).
no autotune in this house we only listen to Natural Music (TM), which is the sound of rocks banging on trees and my screams of pain
didnt know tpain and kurt collabed
Why is Usher being so rude like dang
I was hoping for the Lego Movie 2 and Masked Singer shoutouts! hell yeah
I loved this take and it needed to be said. Thank you 😎
i LOVE when autotune is used the way he made popular, it is such a fun and satisfying sound
music is an art form. there is no "bad music", there's only different tastes & preferences within music. disliking a person/saying someone *ruined* music just because of their artistic choices is so incredibly immature and only shows how jealous usher clearly was of t pain.
One of my biggest regret is not buying the I Am T-Pain microphone toy in like 2011. I could have had so much fun.
I think Stevie Wonder was using the talkbox before zap and Roger
Imagine the hutzpah of saying RnB is ruined when artists like Xavier Omar, Sango, Kyle Dion, Dvsn etc. etc. exist.... 🙄
The auto tune is Tpains signature sound and for an artist that’s what is the most sellable feature. Shame on Ursher! Who tf made him the gatekeeper of music?
I don’t understand how people don’t get that auto tune is an instrument and he fucking rocks that shit. But he can also sing really well by himself. It’s just elitism. Everyone wants to think they are better then everyone else.
Fam really said EXPRESSO please 🤚
I like tpain as a twitch streamer more than i did back in 2005 when he killed radio for me. Well he was more like the nail in the coffin
Cancel T-pain?    Nope.
This entire situation is a total bruh moment
Watch t-pain's tiny desk and tell me that man is not an excellent musician. I dare you. I'm not the biggest fan of autotune, but he uses it well and he literally changed the face of music with his impact.
Without autotune, there are a lot of great songs that I wouldn't be able to enjoy. Also, T-Pain isn't using autotune to "correct" his pitch - it is a musical choice. I don't like the sound of the extreme T-Pain autotune personally, but I also don't like a lot of action movies. That doesn't mean action movies are bad - it is a personal preference.
It’s like when people saying that digital art is not real art or “ruining art”
Bro, you have music labels and radio stations that only will play music that follow the same formula of the last 10 years for each genere making innovation and experimentation a lot harder if you want to stay relevant or living off music. Or how those music labels profit out of artist work and this artist don't see a fraction of the money... but T-Pain is the worst think that happen to music?
Auto tune or not - there are so many songs with auto tune that sounds awesome. T-Pain songs are awesome too! I jammed to his music throughout highschool and they bring so many memories. Ryan Leslie - Gibberish is an awesome autotune song *memories*
OK BUT DANGELO LISTENS TO WILLOW AND IM DYING
Why are people agreeing with usher. T-pain is such a good person  ITS HIS STYLE
T-pain has an opera voice, heard it in person it's impressive
Quick question did Usher have the same energy for The Dream??
Usher improved std's an break ups
Usher ruined sex cuz… he keeps spreading disease
You need to have your own lecture class at a university
This was really informative. Sideways also did a video about this that really goes into auto tune and pitch correction. But like it’s so obvious that t-pains use of auto tune is an aesthetic.
T-pain love his music if you think that he messed up music then fix it dummy
He can really sing though! He has a beautiful voice!
Did no one see he won that masked singer show? He did so many different genres and sang acapella. It was amazing.
My husband works at a computer store and he has worked with T Pain several times. He's super kind and always stops and takes photos with fans. My husband says he sings ALL the time and it's flawless. Absolutely no studio equipment, just his raw voice, it's amazing. (I think my husband helped him build his streaming computer?)
I respect you so much D'Angelo, you're such a genuine and good hearted person
As you said; auto tune is a tool! It takes skill to use it and even more skill to use it like he does! Sure you might not like it but music is subjective. Jeez usher wth
You can tell that t pain understands music theory and structure which is important for making music that sounds good !
At least he blares the auto-tune instead of hiding it.
Will you be talking about creepshow art?
How the duck are you actually gonna wake me up on an airplane have me go all the way to the back to tell me that I ruined music. Like I mean and it was usher of all people. Dude who do you actually think you are 😭😭😭
Um. So I'm a musician. Not vocalist, but a violinist and cellist. How...........how did T Pain ruin music? To me he just popularized a certain style of music. Whether you like it or not, that Auto Tune sound is a style of music that a lot of people now enjoy. It didn't push all other music into the garbage. There is now just another style out there. And it isn't even all that new! I mean.....I love violent Hellectro. And I'm a "real" musician. I think most people would choose Auto Tune over that soooo.............🤷🤣🤣
Well now I'm streaming Willow Smith! Anyone got recommendations?
Y'all should watch Sideway's video where he goes in depth into how EVERYBODY uses autotune. T-Pain wasn't even the first person to use autotune as an effect :(( I hope T-Pain is in a better place mentally now
I don’t mind it when auto tune is used as an effect like here with t pain or daft punk it’s when they try to hide it because they’re f*cking lazy that it bothers me and newsflash everyone uses auto tune. It’s lazy producers that killed music
Usher need to stfu!
Every f*cking song on the charts uses auto tune.
Do you guys remember when we raided t pain on stream
Hello? Have y’all seen the Tom and jerry movie? Dude, this is t-pain’s thing 🤔
Yet there's a whole 20 minute video of the man singing without autotune?
Te amo gracias por este video sos un genio
okay but no one is talking about how T-Pain's actual singing voice (without audio tune) is amazing. I mean watching the show Masked Singer you can hear it live
Setting everyone straight. I hope T Pain sees this.
Guys, watch sideways' video, he has a great video on autotune!!!
Literally the dumbest argument ever usher, you choose to use auto tune or not, that artist ruins there music by there own choice it doesnt ruin other artist who dont use it like wtf lmao , close minded people makes the most stupidest statements ever
T-Pain just seems like a nice dude. Makes fun music - heck even free music for streamers with the pizzle pack.
People really need to do a refresh on Correlation vs Causation.
I only know a little about him, but just cause he tried something doens't mean everyone else had to follow him. Its the same when an artist find something to do in Photoshop and everyone else over use it until it becomes a meme.    I will say, I don't like how much auto tune has proliferated. especially as a BTS fan, they sing just fine so why so much? a little goes a long way
yesssss, i love this whole video so much. auto tune doesn't just suddenly give someone a great voice people talk about it like it's magic and EVERYONE uses pitch correction. all parts of creating a huge song are thought about. good example being "black swan" by bts if you look into the meaning of the song and the reason their voices were more obviously tuned and all their voices blended together more than usual etc.
Also unpopular opinion: it's not bad, you just like your own shitty music for nostalgia reasons
I don't really listen to T-Pain, but I don't got anything against him.  It's sad to think he had to go through that-
He's an amazing singer. He chose the autotune for a stylistic choice and it's so sad Usher would insult him to his face about it. Like you mentioned, Cher used autotune in '98.T-Pain was an actual 13 year old child in '98.
Please do more videos like this. It's awesome you look great. And most importantly you are happy
Honestly almost every singer uses autotune, especial for tracks. The real point of autotune is to use it in a way where a listener can't tell. T Pain didn't do anything wrong
D’ANGELO CONGRATS YOU GOT #18 ON TRENDING
From a sound engineer, this was an excellent analysis! Loved every minute of this.
people don't know what autotune is
I hope T-Pain watches this
Usher saying tpain ruined music but he's  ruining ppls sexual health with his herpes having self
If it wasn't t pain.. it would have been someone else. Also he didn't use it because he needed it.. have you ever heard him sing acoustic??? Man's got chords.
I think it's important to clarify auto-tune hasn't ruined music it's ruined live music
lmaoo u spilled but how can someone blame 1 person for ruining music? usher is trash. period. also, exactlyy!! u need to find good music cuz it's still there!! now it's not our fault some ppl are actually listenin to dixie then complain but mudic bein bad.
18:32 GO OFF, SHEEEESH
Don't act like you're not one of the chief cancellation officers on Youtube dude. You've purposely cancelled so many people.
He also is so coolbeans - he did a interview with gus and eddy on the podcast and he literally is the neatest dude(anime fan and all)
CANCEL USHER
T-Pain isn't even just a fun artist, he's also a genuinely nice person. The fact he's being cancelled over nonsense is a joke.
hope T-Pain can find this video and feel a little better... he doesn't deserve this
I'm just confused because he pronounced it "banGer" instead of "baNGer". Have I been pronouncing it wrong?
I hope this vid reaches T-Pain, so he can see the love and admiration his fanbase has for him!
I, for one, welcome our new T. Pain overlord.
“Music produced today is shit, it used to be better,” — everyone at every point of history.
By this logic, lil john ruined rap
Lol... Usher got someone to wake this poor guy up and then proceeds to tell him that he ruined music. What how...
ECKSPRESSO
PROTECT T-PAIN AT ALL COSTS
Honestly fine with that. There are plenty of people who have REAL talent and don't require autotune. Time to step down so we can step up.
When usher is deadass gatekeeping music now. The nerve of this man smh. I dont listen to t-pain, but even I know that's a horrible thing to say to someone.
the only genre where i dont like auto tune is rap. like seriously. its rapping, stop autotuning it! you dont have to hit notes when you rap!!
This was such a well put together video
Whats crazy is that Auto Tune was going on way before T-Pain srarted using it. T-Pain is a very talented man and icon they better gone somewhere.
Honestly I always think of Cher straight away… I’m so OLD
This makes me so sad :( I love T Pain AND Usher...  Why do people have to be assholes?
Then he goes and wins the mask singer cause no one thought it was him.  Also Usher is a punk a$$ b!tch. He whines about the music TPain makes then used autotune on “OMG"  Like get the hell off your high horse.
Not only did his “friend” unnecessarily tell him this, he was thinking about it so much he had to wake him up to tell him 😑
No one man can ruin music.... music is basically it's own entity, not to mention universal witch have been proven by scientist btw...so to blame a single person for that, just sounds like a lack of musical awareness and or perception on their part..
If youre on the fence listen to t pains tiny desk performance
These people are literally stuck in the late 2000s when it became an absolute cliché to bash new artists of that decade.
Auto tune has kinda made it where most famous people think they're also a singer. Now we have people like Gabby Hannah and Trisha Paytas claiming to be singers..
The weekend and Ariana small artists ??? Dislike for that 🖕🏼
the last part made me sad. not sure when this was filmed and if this was before all the creepshow stuff happened but i cant help but feel like what d'angelo said at the end was related to shannon. sending lots of love <33 we all genuinely love u.
i cant finish the vid because twitter annoys me but watch t-pain's streams on twitch thats all
It’s weird to me to criticize art but I get it I guess
Please address the Shannon/Creepshow art situation.
I hope T-Pain watches this video, and I hope he's gotten better now.
Prediction: D'Angelo will start a musical career at some point. He is knowledgeable beyond a layman doing some research.
Hate tpain sound. He absolutely doesnt deserve the hate tho
Usher's out here acting like autotune broke into his house, killed his wife and dog and burned the place down.
Usher is still trying to assert his opinion?? Usher, you had your hayday. Sssssshhhh.  T-Pain is cooler than Usher any day. 🤷🏼‍♀️
*Chloe Bailey’s vocal range:* 📈
Tecca??
I have nothing deep or insightful to comment. I just wanted to let you know I think you're great.
T pain can sing just amazingly without auto tune!
Idc auto-tuning makes things sound much more clean harmonically say all i want ppl
Also, T-Pain is actually an amazing singer, even without the auto tune. So it’s not like he doesn’t have the talent. But if that’s how he chooses to make his music, I love it.
Music cant be ruined, some people just need to evolve
aye d’angelo drop your playlist
Lil durk uses autotune
Bruh if I was T-pain usher and I would've had to fight just for waking me up to yell me some NONSENSE! I'm still gonna fight usher just for waking him up to hurt his feelings 🥴🤷🏾
Is that a joke bro??? People cancelling T-Pain?????
autotune is a tool like any other. it's not the tool it's how u use it
???   Has no one watched the Masked Singer?  *SPOILERS FIR THE SHOW BELOW IF YOU CARE*      My man T-Pain WON, if I remember correctly, and he very, VERY much can sing without autotune.  Fir those that didn't know, and I'm not sure if the show is still running or not, but the show was about celebrities dressed up in elaborate, themed costumes, and a panel of judges had to guess who they were based only on they're singing style and small, subtle context clues that would be dropped before and after their performances.   In the first season of the show, our boy T-Pain not only kept coming back week after week because the judges couldn't figure out who he was, but he kept nailing all of his performances. His voice, for every single one, was *beautiful,* and honestly, his reveal was kind of a shock towards the very end. While it made me wonder why he used, and was famous for, his autotune for most of his career, I realized then that it was simply part of his style, to differentiate himself from a neverending wave of pop stars and other artists. And y'know what-- that's fine by me.  So, idk-- put down your pitch forks and chill? People genuinely don't need to hunt for a thing to be mad about. Life's too short for that.
Saying autotune ruined music is like saying MIDI ruined instruments. Blatantly untrue. Also, it’s just real mean. 🥺
Fuck T pain. He sucks and so do you.
Oh my God he included the exact same autotuned Dixie D'Amelio clip that Nick DiRamio pointed out the weird extra syllable on too 15:15 lololol
also.... i dont think that these people that are saying something about RNB actually listen to anything besides mainstream RNB some singers in this genre have great music on Spotify and soundcloud that are hardly starting to blow up
So personally i only like auto tune in some musics, if not for slightly pitch correction. I think that if the masses like autotune music, there is nothing wrong with it, and for sure making something that becomes popular takes talent somewhere along the way. Maybe not so much from the singer anymore, but from the audio engineers. But each case is a case. T pain should actually be proud for being able to make so much success out of this, specially since it seems like he can really sing from what i heard. ( I don’t really listen to T pain). edit: All the good exemples in the video were artistic choices from the singers, that shiat i slap to. If you want a bad exemple of autotune, listen to any youtube teen, teen house star song. Most will have a weird autotune.
Wasn't that like T-pains thing? 🤦‍♀️
Okay but why did that song got stuck in my head tho?🤦🏾‍♀️
hold up Mr. Wallace are you married? I see that ring on your ring finger on the left hand O_O
i'm sorry but t-pain's autotune music slaps.
I didn’t know T Pain had that much power.  Like when Dr Dre dropped The Chronic and everything released after that sounded like The Chronic.  Last I remember, record labels chose what songs are released.
Boycott usher 😤
The internet has given people the confidence to think they can have an opinion on things they don’t really know enough about, and you can tell in the way they talk about these things. Like D’angelo was saying, auto tune is just one part of audio engineering and it goes into literally almost every recorded piece of music. People need to just stick to what they actually know lol
A Minecraft parody really got more recognisable than Ushers original song for him to say this.
bro no, saying that to someone else is already shitty but to say that to your alleged friend??? Usher is a bad friend for that forreal.
Is the secret channel for a cult? 🙋 Count me in
Currently trying to get out of that slump from a careless sentence said to me. So totally get the feeling when someone you don't expect messes with your brain
BRUH did they really say that r&b production has gone down… nah it’s just they’re not being played on the radio bc dj’s only play top 40 and that’s not what today’s r&b artists are doing
I love the way everyone and their mother talked about Trisha and Ethan, David DOBRIK and James, BUT NOT OUR BOY WALLACE 😂😂😂
im gonna say smth probably controversial that ive been getting slammed for but autotune CAN be used artfully? like a lot of the music i listen to is heavily autuned and i get a lot of slack for it but its thoughtfully used in my opinion?? the people who complain about it (when its CLEARLY used in a way thats suppose to be obvious and artisic) like ok thats just ur taste but dont act like ur opinion is The Fact its kinda fucked up?? like they sound like those people who think people who listen to vocaloid/songs from anime/animated musciains and call it “ruined/fake music” god u sound like those men who think theyre morally superior for liking nirvana or some shit like if u likecertain genres/old school stuff i totally respect u but dont disrespect a whole genre bc u just have different taste like wow...
That's so fucked up and rude of Usher (who sings about nothing but fucking and cheating) to say to him. Usher was probably a sellout and now all his managers were telling him that's what you've gotta do. Tons of BIG artists copied TPain and did the autotune thing back then. They were copying TPain because their managers want them to do what's selling.
Ohhh thanks for the Willow Smith recommendation. Love that sound 🥰
this whole thing is giving the "Traditional art vs Digital art" debate like,,, autotune is literally just another tool to make an already existing thing great + i feel like they have the right to coexist :/ t-pain has been disrespected by the industry for so long and i aint havin it !
I hope T-Pain sees this video. Your fans love you and need you to come back ❤  Usher can have several seats
usher sounds very boomer with this statement, meanwhile t pain has aged gracefully both musically and personality wise
Aye-fuckin-men bro.
Usher so salty because tpain has been leveling the playing field and demystifying music production since day one paving the way for so many, releasing his sample library for freeee
jacob my bestie!!!!!!!
I lost count of how many times I said “facts” to this video
You're perfect
ITS THE TWO RANDOM SMALL ARTISTS FOR ME 😭😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀👩‍🦲👩‍🦲👩‍🦲👩‍🦲👩‍🦲👩‍🦲👩‍🦲
In the stereotype fashion that a rapper has to be on lean, violence and always surrounded by girl. T-Pain is the farthest person from that. He has a true talent, faithful to his wife, stay away from drama, never throw out beef to be famous. He is precious and should be put out of all this bullshit
Lol I wrote a whole long comment comparing it to an electric vs acoustic guitar before I finished watching the video and saw you used that same example at 12:00. Oops. But yes! That point exactly. Even just with vocals. I'm a renaissance/baroque musician. The conventions, techniques, and the actual music itself are different to a lot of modern music, so my singing wouldn't sound exactly "right" to someone who mainly listens to pop music, and that could be said for any other combinations of genres. But that doesn't mean either are bad. Music doesn't have to be (and shouldn't be!) completely the same or appreciated equally by every single person. That would take all the creativity out of it. Pitch correction is just another tool musicians have at their disposal. It's not inherently 'evil' or whatever. There have always been music purists who think music should be done a certain way, or that other music is wrong (an example comes to mind: tritones were considered the devil's interval! Or in common practice, parallel fifths are a huge no because they were overbearing and intense, but they get used a lot now because they're powerful and compelling), and that's just sad bc it tries to limit all the possibilities out there. There will always be stylistic shifts in music, but that doesn't mean the old styles disappear forever (take it from me, I do music that's hundreds of years old!)
with this and the last vid, im happy Dangelo is bringing back his old aesthetics, I personally was not a fan of the twitch stream videos upload
D'Angelo Wallace president 2024??
Thank u for making this❤️
Autotune is my favorite instrument, 808s & Heartbreak is my bible, Cher is my godess, T Pain my messiah. ... T Pain is a great rapper too btw, T Wayne, Karaoke, the few times he raps he goes hard.
Ok, we're gonna need D'Angelo to drop a playlist for us to discover music
I didnt listen to or know t pain that much but he looks like a sweet person also he thanking you is soooo wholesome. maybe the most wholesome thing I heard in a while lol. because he is already big and most people wouldnt even care about a small creator shouting them out. i want a deangello t pain collab now
There's a song called Lost by Avenged Sevenfold. It's a metal song that has autotune as an artistic choice, and it's fucking fantastic.
i missed ya
Honestly this criticism doesn't even make sense to me. Each new song using pitch correction had musicians and engineers making choices to produce it. If an artist made the decision to use autotune in a way that ruins the song, arguably it wasn't "ruined" it was just poorly conceived to begin with. You can't just carve out the part of an artist's style you dislike and go "Oh but that's not their fault that came from T-Pain." That isn't how creativity works.  "Ruined" implies there WAS something there that would have been good sans autotune, that then got forced into a pitch-corrected style that didn't fit the song. Whether that comes from the creator's intent or impositions by producers...T-Pain wasn't standing in the booth with a gun to their heads MAKING them copy him.  It'd be like blaming Basquiat for all the mediocre outsider art that got popular after him: some gallery director still DECIDED to show mediocre paintings; some artist still did the work itself. Maybe their decisions were informed by seeing the success one artist had doing it *right*, but that's hardly causation. You can't really blame someone for other people imitating them.   For real though, what was T-Pain gonna do, send out C&D notices to everyone doing a bad T-Pain impression so his style didn't get a bad name? Artists don't have the power to stop other people from copying them, even if it gives their style a bad name.
I just wanna give tpain a hug, man is a legend
Bro you were 7 when tpain was doing his thing. Your talking about something that happened 15 years ago🤦🏿‍♂️
me seeing bee’Angelo in the back makes my day just bees smile makes me smile thanks bee
Nooooo he sounded so sad 😭
7:58 _"Imagine telling somebody else they ruined music when you're the one who Discovered Justin Bieber"_   D'angelo: did they lie though  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“people on Twitter” oh no here goes Twitter again
T-Pain, ily.  It’s so fascinating how people blame him. People listened to him. He can’t help that he made something that was consumer friendly. They’re just mad that they didn’t realize the market was out there
cmon usher, you’re better than that 😐 t-pain is literally the goat
Poor t-pain. Literally everyone uses auto tune in the music industry. Usher really needs to learn to shut his mouth
I loved his own voice. He has a voice to die for!! I heard it the masked singer which he won!
TPain is also a big Rainbow Six Siege player on the low,  he played in a charity event and surprised everyone by actually knowing how to play siege, and not a just a celebrity guest like lil yachtie on his opposing team, he played with Siege Streamers and Youtubers, and he was an absolute delight bantering with RussianBadger (you can watch the highlights on RussianBadgers channel) after seeing him being so chill and down to earth I started to  love Tpain  Here’s the clips https://youtu.be/1tQiRk30BHU
Celebs with millions of fans and millions & millions of dollars don't get *cancelled.* What's happening isn't cancel culture. It's people being assholes. He's not cancelled. He'll bounce back.
This again.🙄 T-Pain studied Auto-Tune before his first single to enhance what he already has. He can sing a capella.
This I agree with. Of course not surprised D'angelo having the right take again. The art is about the outcome, not the process. If it sounds good, then it's good music. How much talent it takes is not relevant for the quality of it. Even though I don't like the auto tune sound, mostly technology has been good for artists.
I thought thee opposite was happening
Whenever I'm on youtube watching videos, I usually just go for ASMR because of how easily I get my headaches. He's the only youtuber I can watch without getting a headache because of his voice and microphone quality.
The Man is a Legend We literally grew up vibing to T-Pain  Cancel culture can go f thmselves Buncha lowlifes 🤬
Thank you for coming in defense of this man. From what I've seen, he's a sweet person and he doesn't deserve this second wave of hate for just speaking his truth.  Also, side note, if you don't feel any type of way about putting the word BOOBIES in your studio recorded song... that deserves some side-eye.
So does Usher feel the same way about Roger Troutman and Zapp? Computer Love? Hell, California Love with Tupac? T-Pain brought that sound back and perfected it. Usher is a huge asshole to say that. Not to mention T-Pain can actually sing his ass off. Usher's ego got him trippin. And she's so so strongly about that he shouldn't be using auto tune now which he does. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Example: his song OMG.  Edit: you brought up OMG and Roger and  Zapp. D'Angelo you never miss. 🔥
Two random small artists lol
Thats like saying cartoons ruined realistic type art or cartoons ruined live action or reality films
Why are fully grown adults saying this shit to each other? “You ruined music” lol Usher you have had kids and choose to be absent from their lives - now who’s ruined who??
D’Angelo, you sound like you’ve been producing music lately
If anyone is interested in learning more in depth about pitch correction and autotune, a YouTuber called Sideways did a really detailed video about it. But the tldw version is that there are now programs that can pitch correct artists whilst performing live these days. There's no way to know whether it's there or not. So artists performing live are getting closer and closer to their studio sound these days.   The autotune effect isn't a thing to be crapping over, it's an effect and nothing more.
I like t-pain. That is all I have to say
first high range was false af and I am tonedeff
Leaving a comment to appreciate the Jacob Collier's demonic talent representation
T Pain! Don’t let Usher big head ass talk down to you ever again with his hating ass. It was his job to update his approach.
Ah yes, the age old “popular thing bad” and “I’m not like other blanks” combined arguments.
Vocoding and auto tune exist since at least the late 70’s in House music and funk. T-Pain man gave us timeless bop and He can got dam sing.
They edited that video like Usher murdered someone LOL
Usher really? The man who made art pieces such as "yeah yeah yeah" and "OMG im so in love"? I love t-pain and he's singing is straight up beautiful but the autotune was a style choice and i wasn't really bothered about it.
Ok but we’re all gonna defend TPain without bringing up his defence of XXX, by saying one Twitter that everyones hits their girl sometimes. He even challenged people to go ask they dad if he ever hit your mom like/… he said that with no shame to his massive audience, inferring it’s chill that sometimes a dude hits his girl and it’s NBD??? Naaaaah
D'angelo really set the record straight and really knows what he's talking about. I appreciate this sm
bruh it’s just music listen to what you find good tf?
Blaming T-Pain for ruining music with the auto-tune craze is like blaming Lorde for ruining music with the the slow electro pop craze that happened after Royals came out. You can’t blame the artist for making iconic work that everyone and their label wanted to profit off of.
Autotune can enhance an artist's sound. For example, Charli xcx, Travis Scott, Dorian Electra, Rico Nasty, Sza, Doja Cat, etc.
The clips from his interview are so sad that I literally had to leave the video and come back when I was in a different head space, geeze
This man usher said " I wanna ruin our friendship "
Auto tune vs herpes, which has ruined more lives?!  If T-Pain is to be blamed for anything, it's for 'ushering' in the stripper culture.
Who is Usher?
ESPRESSO not ESPRESSO Never would I think this mistake was made in any language exept for Russian
I dont like T-pain but he didnt ruin music.
Everyone needs the watch the video called The Problem With Auto-Tune by Sideways and broaden your horizon.
I just finished my fourth year of a music degree, which includes music analysis of all genres. My take is that the idea of someone “ruining music” is wrong on so many levels. First, it’s flawed to say a single person is responsible in this style. As you said, audio engineers, producers, composers, songwriters, performers, and singers are all involved in the artistic process. Contemporary singers in more popular genres tend to be falsely credited with the entire creation of the song. This both erases more backstage talent and puts a ridiculous amount of responsibility on one person that they can’t control. If I make a good arrangement, the group performing, conductor, original writer, and anyone connected to the potential recording of the piece is also responsible for any potential success. Second, it’s literally impossible to ruin music. While one piece, artist, or artistic movement may gain more popular acclaim, it’s not inherently better than any other. Different strokes for different folks. Just because something isn’t to your taste or focuses on making areas you care about more virtuosic or complex doesn’t mean it objectively has more or less value. So stop hating on people for their art! It all had its place and purpose, and we should value and appreciate all of it, even if we wouldn’t add it to our playlist. D’Angelo nailed this video like literally every single other video and everything he ever does.
I ahh I thought usher was a girl wtf am I doing
people "learn the difference between pitch correction for note accuracy vs. autotune as a vocal effect" challenge: failed
No we aren’t 🙄. T-pain is fine. He can sign well, he took an artistic take on the sound of his voice, and it worked.
Usher pretending that T-Pain didn't trailblaze a whole new trend in music as if music isn't subject to changing fashions, just like everything else, like I can't.
Also though, t-pain's music is way better than usher's
I miss the days when people had actual hobbies that didn’t include sending out destructive tweets :(
Avu chan from queen bee does all of that for me.
Be kind to others, you can be the straw that broke the camels back. Words are so powerful.
Lol, dangelo so gay
More like deez nuts
I'm not having any of it either, T-Pain perfected and refined autotune, and the fact that he can sing without it is a bonus...
T Pain is a good dude, the guy has made all his songs available for Twitch Streamers to use without any copyright infringement issues (I learned about it from his appearance on the Gus & Eddy Podcast) and that's poggers considering how highly his music is sought after for licensing by big media corporations.
He is a disgrace to music! This ain't art - it is fraud. I did not watch this video, only found it on trending. I feel bad for him, but the facts are facts, Usher is right, let us not try to justify wrong and turn it into good, now again I did not watch this video. because it looks like a big waste. All subscribers, take a course on udemy or something, do not waste on things that wont help you
There is soooooo much great R&B out. Y’all just not checking for it. 😒, dead the top 100 music  and look for music you actually like.
Thank you for making this video. There is not a cap on creativity. If you get it, you get it. I was loving T-Pain music. 😭 fuck you usher. You woke that man outta his sleep to diss him. 🤬 . We know who can sing and who got auto tune 🤨.
Idgaf that t-pain used autotune, he had an idea and made it work, he even has a good voice without the autotune, canceling people who don't deserve it is just dumb af.
Saying T-Pain ruined music with auto-tune is like saying that artists who popularised photoshop ruined digital art.
Wow I gotta start listening to more songs getting performed live bc the singers shown here did that
The best part is he’s a great singer without autotune 😂 God I love people 🤦🏽‍♀️
I absolutely loved T Pain on Masked Singer! He was my favorite.
Just goes to show how words can have a long lasting affect regardless of your intentions when you uttered them.
The man who gave us Justin Bieber is being loud out here
can you PLEASE perhaps do more videos on music things? i love how you talk about it so much! only if it tickles your fancy though obviously
D'Angelo has a point about "everything is pitch corrected." As a software engineer who studied EECS (electrical engineering & CS) in university (which includes stuff like digital signal processing that one would use to filter audio), we absolutely could do pitch correction on anything you hear these days, even live stuff, if we really wanted. The delay for using even the heaviest algorithms possible would be no greater than 100ms and that's reaaaaaaaaally pushing it (more like <10ms). I'm not aware of anything that could take that long. And even that amount is imperceptible by humans generally, especially when it's a voice coming out of a speaker on a live stage, which already has considerable delay.
Music is so subjective, I do not listen to a lot of their music, however my kids listen to Usher to be honest I didn't like his music he has a holier-than-thou attitude. Oh my kids listening T-Pain he seemed honest and his music has fun I was in the whole lot f this and if that. T-Pain just went up a few notches in my book I love listening to European Rock they playing all kinds of instruments whoever heard of Planet keytar or banjo and have a metal and it turned out great I love music of all kinds the newer music is all the same but there are some songs that I do like
imagine someone waking you up just to say horrible things to you. I would not be as kind as T-Pain
bruh using autotune is like hot sauce, spice even. if them vocals not in key nothing will make em sound fire regardless g shit find music you dig and hush up.
Go watch T-Pain's NPR Music Tiny Desk if you want to see that the man actually has chops. For you younger generation, you might not know.
🎵 Everybody's gotta know that 👏 music 👏 is 👏 subjective! 🎵 🎵 I might not like what you like, that's okay 👏 'cause 👏 it's 👏 subjective! 🎵
if someone is genuinely secure in their singing and their talent, they wouldn't feel threatened by people using autotune as a STYLISTIC CHOICE. it's insecurity and direct projection onto the subject. usher can have his opinion, but he should have kept it to himself.
Other amazing R&B artists right now- Pink Sweat$, BRYSON TILLER(BRO TFF), Daniel Cesar(deserves more attention than just with Peaches and JB💅), Brent Faiyez, Chloe x Halle, Khalid, UMI, Miguel, Omar Appollo, H.E.R., Jhene Aiko, SZA, Summer Walker, The Weeknd, Jazmine Sullivan, Keyshia Cole, Alina Barez, Kehlani, WILLOW. There's still so many more that I can't think of anymore but point it don't be ignorant!
Also in the whole episode of that Netflix show it talks about how for years even before tpain was popular, auto tune existed. So why does he have to be blamed for something he didn’t even invent but just used in a different way than intended.
It’s so bizarre to me that Usher, T-pains friend, woke him up in the middle of the night just to insult him.
Dont like auto tune. Like good natural voice. You listen to your stuff, i'll listen to mine, its all good. Simple as.
Ya'll mfs trippin...to life there will always be a balance of good and bad. Take the time to look at both side of things before you judge because negative energy isn't good for the soul!
Usher ruined music with his loose peen and giving people chlamydia... He relied heavily on pandering to children since 2020 to make a lame ass comeback.   T-pain is iconic and he never hid the fact that he used Autotune. And the man sounds amazing without it so what does it even matter.   Usher and his Gen Z dummies need to go take a seat, he bout to have another scandal pop off real soon. You can smell it.
In high school health class we had to pretend we were at a party and drinking (to show the dangers of pure pressure and substance abuse) and my teacher played t-pain as back round music and i will never forget that memory and that t-pain was part of it while i was drinking fruit punch pretending it was alcohol
I trust your opinion on music bc of the midi behind you
T__T ugh poor T Pain, fuck usher that shit was cruel.  Good songs are subjective. Some people like T Pain, are we saying they're definitively wrong? Because I don't think anyone can really say that? And like you said, a few shitty songs doesn't mean good songs cease to be created.   I feel bad he went through this for 4 years ._.
Loved seeing Shamir here  Also omggg who is Chloe
Usher is like that bitter ass journalist who blamed Shrek for the terrible animated comedies that came after it
I fell in love with T Pain on The Masked Singer... I ONLY knew him from "I'm On A Boat" and his LAST clue was "At least I'm not doing this... on a boat." and I was like... "T Pain?"  Great video, and I enjoy the positive direction you're going.
T-Pain has an incredible ear and an one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable voices. The Cher comparison is honestly pretty great, because though people make fun of his style, EVERYONE knows who it is when his songs come on, just like Cher.
Not USHER-BUCKS being bitter
https://youtu.be/CIjXUg1s5gc
It's sad how nowadays we just compare Twitter to people cancelling each other for no reason. I remember when Twitter wanted to cancel Quackity for speaking Spanish even though he's Mexican 🤩🤩🤩
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
People who complain about autotune are the same kind of people who in the past got offended by jazz and late by rock n roll. If you don’t like it, don’t listen to it. Especially today you can literally choose from millions of songs. But instead you decide to complain about progress and technical advances in music
Me every other day: I'm a casual T Pain fan. Me after hearing Usher woke T Pain up from sleep just to put him in a depression: Stan T Pain forever.
It's crazy how we got the same last name
Ah yes, the age old “popular thing bad” and “I’m not like other blanks” combined arguments.
The fact that you’re one of my fav YouTubers and you included my brother Shamir in your vid made my night
Roger and Zapp are fire...literally so fire.
T-Pain can sing with or without  auto tune thats how talented he is🤷🏽‍♀️❤😎
Usher has some nerve.
based
usher woke that man up on the flight just to take him down a notch because usher was threatened and jealous. he wanted to cause damage and he succeeded. he sucks.
I get what Usher is talking about and  I am a fan of neither artist... Coming from the 90s hay day even in my own pursuit of a music career you had to practice to sing at the drop of a hat for auditions to be able to carry your melody without music. That was the thing it gave us a lot of great artists like S.W.V., Envogue, and of course Destiny's Child. and that was only the girl groups at the time not to mention the singers that came out of it. There was a time when autotune was only meant to correct small unnoticeable spots in your voice within the song and then you carry it from there.   going back further music used to have a wide range of sounds and looks that you do not get from today's music.  most of it sounds the same and canned.     That is the problem that T pain may not have intentionally started but began none the less for lesser able singers no longer needed to have a strong voice to become a singer (JLO)  you could auto-tune the cords to a so so voice and end up with a song that slaps not really with the SInger themselves being able to carry it the same way when they are in concert. which is the ultimate hustle for a singer to travel and sing on the road, not in the studio.     With that being said because people will allow themselves to consume whatever garbage music that is given to them you end up with completely capable singers having to use what is out there in order to stay relevant because unlike the  70s music is no longer based on the music it is based on its popularity and people willing to buy it even if it sounds the same as the last artist you heard.    the closest thing to the autotune movement was disco. but even disco used real singers most of the time.   The sound of music and diversity on the radio or xfm whatever you are getting your music from you can only find now on the stations that are dedicated to what is now an old way of doing things.    at the end of the day, people with sensitive ears like mine are not for the autotune craze, if it was just one maybe two artists doing it in a unique fashion I could see it but I mean they even crossed it over to gospel music where there are many strong REAL  awesome voices that just don't need it.  autotune is the ranch or sriracha or the red hot sauce... they put that isht on everything... whether it needs it or not.
I'M actually fed up with yall at this point- while auto-tune is mostly looked down upon and I can understand why (oOoo not reAl Singing, BLEH) and most of the autotune shit we hear now is well- shit. That's not the autotune he does!  THE AUTOTUNE HE DID WAS NOTHING LIKE THE AUTOTUNE YOU HEAR NOW. It has a melody, it wasn't that mumble shit and overall it was a new sound and it fucking SLAPPED. AND THE MF CAN SING AND PRODUCE AND QUITE WELL. So to come out the wood works and blame "tHe DeClinE of RnB" on him is just about dumb as shit.  Just because you don't see usher or ne-yo or any other well known rnb singer in the mainstream doesnt mean rnb is dead. For you to think that means that YOU arent looking around for the music and YOU'RE just so stuck and in love in the ole great times of the 2000s 😐. H.E.R. exists, Bryson tiller exists, Jasmine Sullivan exists, Giveon exists and so many many more.  Another point is that yall mfs got to understand that MUSIC DOESN'T STAY THE SAME. The reason why Usher even had the gall to say that to T-pain because his own career wasn't popping the same it was as time went by. He was so bitter at the fact that he was doing better than him 😐😐😐. Even now, autotune is a lot more accepted BUT HEY you sure don't see T-pain blaming all the new artists using autotune not in the same fashion he did for "ruining music".    Ending it all with these: T-pain is a an amazing artist who's paved the way for a lot more people or at the very mf least GAVE US SOME MF BOPS. ( chopped an screwed anyone?) Usher is- face it- not as hot as he used to and he needs to accept the fact and move aside for the new r&b GENERATION. And lastly GIVE T-PAIN AN APOLOGIZE AND GIVE HIM HIS FLOWERS. I absolutely love his music and his personality he's so sweet.  End of story: this is one of the reasons I hate twitter :D Thank you for coming to my TedTalks.
YOU HAVE RELEASED MUSIC THE WOO HOO SONG WAS A BANGER
Look…church will forever be my song. Also…a lot of artists do auto tune
As a singer I get what Usher meant, he basically popularized mediocrity because of the clutch called “auto tune”. Plus he was probably just being personally honest with his “friend”. Did he think it would make him depressed? Probably not. But this is what dialogue is about. No one should be canceled for that but Mr. D’Angelo, you don’t sing so this dissection of what makes music music is not up to you. I still love watching your videos but this one triggers me.
They need to step the heck off T-Pain...has no one heard his Tiny Desk Concert?? HE'S AMAZING. Also, hello?? First Masked Singer winner??? I mean c'mon..
Travis literally does the same thing
okay considering you like rock and autotune you need to check out Deftones if you haven't already! I think you'll really love their stuff, particularly their newest album
TPain got pipes without autotune yo.... don’t play w my guy out here
I can’t STAND Melodyne, Antares Autotune is all u ever need in life
blindsided on this one. Trump
Honestly he shouldve known Usher was officially an old man once these words left his mouth.
Wow you know Jacob collier 🤗 so cool
Petition to make T Pain the next disney prince (or Disney-esque if we want to escape Big Mouse lol)
T-pain influenced kanyes music from 808s-now in a way
T-Pain, Kanye, And Lil Wayne are responsible for a whole generation of music and yet people are slandering them🤦‍♂️ YOU’RE FAVORITE ARTIST LOVES THEM‼️
All I could think during this video is Tulsa Jesus Freak by Lana del Rey the song is sooo good and the auto tune during the end is so satisfying 😍😍😍
where is usher's impact on the industry besides herpes
Dude what… if you can sing you can sing if you can’t you can’t lmfao like I’m pretty sure it would take a absolute TON of work to engineer and autotune someone who absolutely can’t sing to sound even presentable. Also everyone has a specific tone they fit in so technically everyone can sing… but we’re not trained andddd we’re not usher, Beyoncé, Chris brown giveon etc etc and  if it wasn’t gonna be t-pain to “Ruin R&B music” then it was gonna be someone else like I’d see if usher got a tiny bit upset if t-pain just couldn’t sing for the life of him and got famous but this is so weird that it’s dumb lol.
I love autotune if it's done right and if it's not too heavy on vocals. If I have already listened to someone with less autotune, where their vocals seem more transparent and clear, and if they suddenly use heavy autotune, it might not mesh with me cause then I can't hear their vocals clearly. But I don't hate the use of autotune, if done in moderation.   With T-Pain, he knows that moderation. I have been listening to him since I was a child and loved his songs. Even a picky person like me who has trouble with heavy autotune, I have absolutely no hate for that man and how he popularised his craft. He deserves to be loved and what Usher did, I am kinda disappointed by it.  I grew up listening to Usher too and never did I think he would actually say that.   Regardles of what we like in our music or dislike, imo, no one is ruining music because there are gazillion styles out there, autotuned or not, that is meant for whoever likes that style. It comes down to your preference and what you like and it just means the artist is catering to your likes and also their likes.   It's the same with T-Pain.  He started using autotune and popularised it cause it was HIS DISTINCT style and also many people liked him for that. They liked his style and it was their preference too.   Just like D'angelo said, T-Pain didn't make other artists go backrupt. At the end of the day, we do what we like and move away from things that we dislike.   Why couldn't people do the same here? But instead they hate on him for ruining music? Its weird.
Twitter is banned in my country Nigeria so I've got no idea
Usher was probably never an usher. Prove me wrong.
I love tpain and he deserves nothing but happiness
Haters are putting so much power in T-Pains hands. Tbh I would assume Usher’s comment came from a place of insecurity. To be someone like Usher and tell someone else that their interpretation of a very broad art form ruined all of music is just small.
Zapp&Roger almost the same sound
Honestly after Usher went to a strip club with fake with his face on it, his opinions aren't valid at all with behavior like that.
He streams on Twitch and he’s a ducking joy.  WTF?!  He is the best dude ever besides Snoop Dawg! He’s a legend!
He did not fuck up music !!!! i just want to hug T-Pain !!!! CHER started
SHAMIR!!!!
Imagine telling your incredibly kind and talented friend that they ruined music by using autotune in an innovative way.  Does Usher not understand how patterns in the music industry work? An artist does something new, they blow up, people copy them and get pushed by labels to try and cash in on the trend, the market gets oversaturated and people get bored, then we move on to the next thing.
First of all, no one (1) person can ruin the entirety of music.
Literally nobody was canceling T-pain on twitter. They were actually defending him against Usher until people found all the horrible things T-pain said and done that they changed their tune then canceled him.
Yes I love willow and tpain thank you for blessing me D'Angelo
i have a friend who is a small artist. And even he auto tunes. In the alternative scene it is common to have the auto tune foot buttons. Theres always been some form of auto tune. Tpain happened to make it his brand- and i support him for that!  Man didn’t ruin music, he just brought his own sound
I have the range that Chloe does... that’s cool to know... Thabk you for introducing me to her
Epiphany was classic. T-Pain is a gift.
The crazy thing is though.. T-Pain can actually sing. If anything.. it's the bad singers that may have ruined anything... That's not T-Pain's fault.
"Do you know how hard it is to find time to sleep these days" Nights still exist 🤡
omg im shook D'angelo posted on my birthday thanks for the birthday present and also im the 4000th comment
It's funny how people saying t-pain ruined music with autotune when yet everyone who is so called a good artist uses autotune in every song. That's wierd very wierd
ok but why does D'Angelo Wallace have a REALLY REALLY good taste in music???
I will quite literally throw hands in defense of T Pain and his talent, it's not his fault weak ass "singers" use it as a crutch. They can kick rocks fr. And Usher is a fucking hack idc
Tyler the creator is a great example of great auto tone
I would have said “well at least I don’t have herpes”
Did you just say EXpresso?
He doesn't even need auto-tune. Just look at the fact that he won Masked Singer lol
twitter- people getting mad over things existing that they don't like
where did you get your hoodie ?
Y’all mad at T pain for using auto tune when there’s literally rappers out her that y’all love that mumble gibberish 🤣🤣🤣 y’all making me lose brain cells. T pain is so adorable and happy person. Fuck usher burning ass. What he know about music.
So what I’m hearing is usher needs to apologize.
21 on trending now the world
I hope so much that tpain sees this video and comment section, we clearly stan you king.
Auto tune is lame as shit
That’s so fucked up.  Auto tune has moved far past making ones pitch more accurate, it’s a stylistic choice at this point, and with ai, auto tune is getting so good you can’t notice it, unless the artist wants you to.
YES! That Ariana and the weekend clip….it takes my soul from my body
If the song sounds good who cares, idk why some people think that just because it’s not to ones personal preference it’s now deemed bad or less then another song or style of music
I for some reason thought Lil Wayne popularized auto tune
who's y'all???
I figured out how to be on his favorite comment shout-out. Just say something super nice to D'Angelo. On that note, as a glasses wearer, you pull them off beautifully.
Listen to Jason Vickery. Thank me later ❤️‍🔥
If I'm being honest I can't say I'd heard of T-Pain before this whole issue came up. That said the whole idea of cancelling someone over their use of autotune is kinda ridiculous. I'm more of a metal guy so I don't really hear much of the more mainstream tracks that use autotune, but I stand by the lyrics of Spirit of the Radio by Rush. "All this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted. Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question of your honesty."
No but why do I still blast that Cher song in my car when I wasn’t even born when it came out 😅 like I just heard it one day and was like THIS SLAPS 😅
T Pain is too much of a cinnamon roll to be deserving hate like this. Honestly if mfs don't like the way he makes music then all they have to do is not listen, shits easy.
I really hope t pain sees this video. He’s gotta hear it from the person you are! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
T-Pain’s range outshines Usher’s… so Usher can have several seats.
I'm sorry but doesn't litterally every singer who shares music use auto-tune? People are so BOREDDD
I just want to know who I can give my money to for that hoodie. I need it asap.
Just because most people play the violin badly doesn't mean violin virtuosos don't exist, and a violin virtuoso who plays electric violin being popular is not to blame for bad players who are inspired by them. T-Pain innovated with essentially a new instrument, it's not on him what others do with it.
don't come for "honey's got some boobies like wow oh wow" it is the only lyric sustaining me
Love tpain
PLEASE watch his cribs episode you'll cry he is the coolest guy
Are y’all kidding me...
FINALLLY!!! I been saying usher is sus! Like just because your gifted it doesn’t make you a decent person.
Saying T-Pain ruined music with Autotune is like saying Skrillex ruined music with his EDM drops. They made it popular, a bunch of people jumped on board and what came out quickly became reductive or lazy.  At what point can you blame the person who was trying out a new thing and did it successfully enough that a bunch of people tried to do the same?
If people are gonna cancel singers over autotune you'll have no one to listen to Even Cher has used autotune ffs
So Usher was that one friend who's secretly envious...
So in conclusion Usher is that friend who's secretly jealous of you
auto-tune always existed, and was already being used.  to be honest all that he's doing is basically turning the auto tune to 100 metaphorically... and the first person that did that in a very popular song was actually Cher in "Do you Believe in Life after Love" .....if you're younger person who may be unfamiliar with that song do urself a favor and GO LISTEN🖤 and tell me that that's not 100% the same sound!?!  did she ruin pop music?? no she didn't.  that song is iconic. so everyone needs to sit the fuck down t pain is also an icon who revolutionized popular music.
The mini shade towards Dixie D'Amelio LMAOO
You resemble that one girl character with the beanie cap on the old show recess. Love it
My parents listened to T-Pain.
My mouth dropped when he asked if we have seen Usher lately
*cher exits quietly*
Can you imagine waking up your friend just to insult their art, influence, and success?  That's not a real friend yo, that's a snake.
twitter bashing this man over his music like they've created the modern Moonlight Sonata, fuck outta here
You can criticize a genre or medium like music for going in a direction you find bad, but blaming a tool or even the person who made it popular is a bit ridiculous!  Like I don't like that a lot of mainstream "has" to be so sleek and overpolished, but thats the mindset and process and not about the tools...
I watched this video yesterday...and you educated me about voice engineering...which allowed/persuaded me to compare this fact to the live performances at the BET awards..and WOW. I could tell who was lip syncing and who wasn't thanks to D'Angelo!
He can sing without the autotune but chooses to use it to make cool effects on his sound for art, like what is Usher’s issue? It isn’t as if T-pain has a bad voice and was using it to sound like a completely different person. He sounds great with or without, like he needs to just chill. T-Pain legit seems so nice too
Bro T-Pain is a much better vocalist than you and I can ever imagine being. The dude is just good bro fr.
People need to realize Auto tune should ENHANCE your voice not MAKE your voice
Cool so #CancelUsher . TPain is an AMAZING singer, auto-tuned or not
isnt r&b but like- 100 gecs
Before you brought her up I was thinking "I'd like to hear him say that to Cher"
I think Jay z did it first. Years ago.
Did anyone else have the TPain autotune mic from years back???
If it wasn’t t-pain, they would’ve found someone else to do it
So you really gonna just not talk about creepshow art
Thumbs up for T Pain. Can't believe Usher made him cry.
He literally uses it by choice, he can sing fine without it ffs. Let the man live Twitter 🤪
Imagine being woken up because someone wants to tell you you’re shit…. bruh
he woke him up from his sleep just to project jealousy & insecurity over his already declining career, we— 💀
T'Pain is a musical innovator. he paved a way & his discography aged well.
T-Pain paved the way for people like Travis Scott and (everyone’s favourite) Post Malone.
Usher is gross
can't believe d'angelo is doing a vtbuer debut as the big project
smh... people really coming after tpain after what he did for music??? the man can ACTUALLY SING. the auto tune was just a plus.
I pray t pain sees this video 😭😭 love that man
I hope T Pain sees this!
I can sing in pitch cuz I’m trained but I am not rly a good singer, being able to sing in perfect pitch isn’t the only deciding factor in a singer
Cancel people are bitches ,,🖕🖕two  thumbs up
Here’s my T-Pain story: I was working with Garyvee back in 2017 and was in the office when Gary had T-Pain in for his podcast. He came in with an entourage and there were WAY more people watching the filming than normal. I was just hanging at my desk watching it online and had no interest in a selfie or anything (partly b/c of huge social anxiety, partly because I’m not a fan of selfies-as-autographs). I wasn’t going to try to get close or anything until I heard him talking about time travel and sci-fi. All the sudden I just HAD to tell him about a book I recently finished that had a really unique take on the genre (focusing on the unknowability of the actually future position of earth in the universe). I made my way over to where everyone was and when he looked over I told him about the book. And instead of blowing me off or giving a quick nod and moving on, he fully engaged for at least a minute and seemed genuinely interested and like I had done him a favor telling him about something cool.   Also, I agree, Jacob Collier is a demon, but I don’t think he should be stopped, I think we should find out what we need to sacrifice to increase his power.
The internet is so diverse. You can listen to whatever the fuck you want. Just because the type of singer you don’t like isn’t popular doesn’t mean they don’t exist and you can’t support them.
i can’t do this he deserves so much thank u mister t pain thank you
https://youtu.be/McvKR-UsQJA
Y’all can chill. Autotune is literally something that almost every person in music uses. It’s not just one person.
ok cool i read a bunch of wholesome t-pain stories in the comments and im about to cry he really seems like a very sweet man and he’s a super talented guy.  i hope he is doing better now ❤️
I wish people could see that the heavily auto tuned esthetic is nothing more than an artistic choice. I feel like there is a lack of understanding in the musical process, the way people want their voice heard is a personal choice. If i want my vocals to sound perfect/robotic i will use auto tune/melodine/warping, but if I want raw emotion/empathy/feeling I will always leave the vocal untouched and rely on performance. No matter what, performance always trumps equipment. If someone is bad at singing, a true ear can detect the use of correctional equipment, but does it matter? If the song is good and you like blasting it in your car then the artist has won. Auto tune is nothing more than software. The choice to use it or not is in the artist hands. Listen to what you feel is right, don't criticize others who differ in opinions.
I always wonder what the state of Hyperpop (100 Gecs, Midxwst, Food House, etc) would be like if t-pain didn't pop off like he did back then. His sound was so influential to experimental music. People use autotune and vocal modification in so many creative ways now and I feel like if t-pain didn't popularize it as much, a lot of these artists might not be making music today
I was just listening to T-Pain on NPR the other day, haha, he seems like such a cool guy
DAngelo on trending! Congrats!
I like just like the beep boops that tickle my ear
The T-Pain mash up with Kurt Hugo Schneider deadass changed my life no cap. T-Pain is incredibly talented and ALWAYS has been.
long story short: hoes mad
T-Pain is the sweetest man and has the loveliest soul it radiates off of him and you can see it in his eyes and demeanor.  D’ANGELO YOU SAYING YOU WOULD LOOK AT USHER LIKE HE WAS CRAZY FOR SAYING THAT TO YOU BECAUSE YOU’VE NEVER MADE MUSIC MADE ME SPIT MY APPLE JUICE
Does anyone know what song Griff is singing at 13:07?
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you He die for you and arose to give you life. And still loves you even though you reject him.

are they really cancelled if you have to explain what's going on?
Thanks for all the playlist adds that I've never heard of b/c I'm old.  edit: Oh yeah and Autotune is great when used properly, it's adds to and evolves the art without removing any of it's previous growth. We get it all. It's a sign of the Zeitgeist and I dig it for that, b/c I'm old.
The most fucked up thing about this is that T-Pain was literally told that his music was TRASH when he tried doing anything else but the Auto-Tune Pop stuff. He's actually an insanely talented Musician/Vocalist but nobody fucking cares about that. The audacity of people these days I actually cannot fathom. Canceling the man for doing what the public harasses him to do when Auto-Tune is NOT even his preference in production and NO ONE respects any of his other kinds of musical material.
I hope he sees this. No more t-pain hate, he doesn't deserve any of that.
The policing of music - and of art in general - pisses me off to no end. Music is art and art has no rules when it comes to its creation. Auto tune is a central part of T Pain’s art, and he should be proud of it. So much creative and fantastic music has come from T Pain’s inventiveness with auto tune. Every single art movement began when people broke the spoken & unspoken rules of the previous/then-current movement. It’s only natural, then, that a lot of people will be pissed when those rules are broken, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t annoying as hell to me every single time. There is no wrong way to do art because art is for everyone and it’s subjective. The art that one person makes will affect every person in a different way, and not always in a good or bad way, and that’s the beauty of it. Anyways, I hope T Pain is happy. I hope he keeps breaking the rules. I felt so sad for him watching that clip. :(
Sorry, does anyone remember a while ago when D'Angelo made that video about Dolly Parton and then put a comment saying something about getting ready to see the darkest video he's ever made that he was gonna post on the main channel? I think he deleted that comment at some point- I wonder if he's still working on that (just out of curiosity)
But are these haters forgetting that T-pain can ACTUALLY sing?!?!
first Ethans Roast, then that comment just before 4 minutes in…. Can’t wait for ur music 😌
Cancel culture is the most toxic thing I’ve seen in my lifetime hands down.
Actually he can genuinely sing, he uses auto tune for artistic value not to make up a lack of talent
I feel so bad for the guy! "Autotune" is just... A sound effect. It's not in itself pitch correction. It doesn't make the bad sound good, it's simply a stylistic choice. It sounds cool.
People are "cancelling" him because tweets were brought up where he said QUOTE  " Aight so what's the temperature on Tory because I was just bout to drop a song with him and $. "  As well as him defending XXXtentacion when he was alive, by implying that most people's fathers abused their wives, and that domestic partner abuse is basically normal.  Cancel culture doesn't exist - it's only ever a group of people bringing attention to something, getting misconstrued, and then suddenly its not about people like myself feeling rightly betrayed.   Because someone who portrays himself as funny and lackadaisical with hidden depths apparently does not value the safety of (Black) women very highly.
Twitter is a cesspool of evil fools. Like any of them has a phuck to give over studio sounds. Not as if he can't sing; it's his signature sound. Bunch of evil haters on Twitter. You did a great job with this vid, D'Angelo.
Someone please just hug him for me
People should never slander t-pain
Usher woke this man up, told him he screwed up music, dropped him into a FOUR YEAR depression, and on top of all of that, they were really good friends… and we’re canceling T- Pain. Uh uh, nope, I’m starting a petition to switch from cancelling T- Pain to cancelling Usher.
I mean but you still have to have a good voice even with auto tune. I think people thinks it works like that episode of ICarly where Freddie completely changes the guys voice live 😂
i really do hope t pain is well and has no regrets for his work. to be ridiculed by his homie , about EVERYTHING HE HAS CREATED AND WORKED FOR, that would destroy anyone. imagine feeling like your greatest works were mistakes. we stan you t pain don't change you, change your opinion on usher :) as i have done sadly
slightly off topic but did y’all hear d’angelo sing on the h3 podcast 😳 king we need more
i love d'angelo educating me on music production while defending tpain, yaur yaur king, its true, its true.
for more, i highly recommend adam neely's video on pitch-correction and autotune in music. he not only mentions cher and t-pain (and countles modern pop artists) but he also draws so many great parallels and insights to this video!! great job :))
I fully support everything said in this video!  T-pain has amazing music and is a icon no doubt about it, and he can actually sing go watch his tiny desk concert like duh.
Imagine being so rude that you would wake someone up and call them over to you just so that you can insult them. But also, music can’t be ruined. There’s music you like, and music you don’t, and whichever of those categories the current trends fall into doesn’t mean anything about music as a whole as it’s self-centered to believe that it does.
Usher's just mad he's Like 50 and his greatest contribution to music was Justin beiber 😂 tpain's songs are still amazing👍🏿
Usher said T-pain ruined music but his most popular song is him saying “yeah” like 95 times lol ok dude
NOOOOOO MORE LET HIM SAY GONE!!! FUCK YOU KID!!!
As an audio engineer I can assure you that autotune and pitch correction is used in 98% of all music today
D’Angelo says “but it’s my opinion and it’s subjective” like we don’t already agree with him
What Usher said was an opinion he was allowed to have but the scenario around how he told TPain that opinion says everything. It wasn't a prompted criticism.... he blindsided him where he couldn't get away (on a plane) after waking him up from sleeping.
15:55 wait till he hears about daft punk
Usher is a f-ckboy who peaked a long time ago. Leave t pain alone gahdamn
COVID 19 IS AN AGENDA. ALL KNOWN.......ALL PLANNED... FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RESET. WARNING. FAKE NEWS WILL BRING A VARIANT THAT IS MUCH WORSE THEN COVID 19 IS COMING GLOBALLY. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING WHAT IS TO COME. THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART..
Art is subjective and so is music if one person doesn't like it but many people do it is just because they have different opinions T-pain sounds good with and without auto tune if you don't like his music don't listen to it. What usher said was wrong Period
Yeah I hardly ever encounter heavily auto-tuned music because I know how to tailor what I consume in line with my own music tastes so maybe Usher should do the same if he doesn't like it this much << I feel like that whole encounter between them on the plane was some kind of power/ego stroke, so mean spirited.
Discovering T Pain’s Twitch channel and what a genuine nerd he is and how wholesome he is with all the creators he collaborates with was one of my greatest joys of this past year.
T pain just mad because his music isn’t selling please don’t bring over artist in his mess
Didn't Usher also knowingly pass on STI's to sexual partners without disclosing that information?
Tpain's auto tune is the musical equivalent of drag queen makeup. You know... and extremely exaggerated addition addition the artwork to make it purposely look, in thus case, sound, deliberately exaggerated? Wtf leave the legend alone.
Bro don’t no one talk about t pain he’s making this up just for clout lmfaoo
mans new channel is music 👀
Bad bunny do not use that that’s cap 🧢😂
Twitter doesn’t know the difference between fact and opinion. Ushers statement was an opinion. Unless you have solid proof and date to show there was a decline is “talented vocalist” then you have a true fact.
T-Pain wrote a song about Animal Crossing that slaps.  Everyone who thinks the man is a disgrace to music can just walk out the door.  He's got his own style, just like any singer/songwriter/musician.  Just because someone doesn't like his style doesn't mean he's "ruined music".
People need to leave T pain alone he is such a sweety & it's not his fault everyone jacked his stuff & Usher out here giving people STDs so he needs to hush.
Sorry people would rather listen to innovative artists than ~real singers~ 🙄
Why is auto-tune always immediately seen as a negative in the music industry music is music my guys, gals and non-binary pals deal with it😔
Anything to try to tear down a black person. Ppl are cancelled for being racist.
Yo willow
Looooooved your Jacob call out, “the sun is in your eyes is ” is on loooop
Asher has a point because autotune has now made it possible for people like Gabbie Hanna who can’t sing now saying with no talent and make money

Welcome back to the Cave. I’ve been living in the attic of Kenny’s studio now for several months. I think this is week 15. It’s hard to tell at this point. The days are running together.

At one point autotune began to be very annoying and frustrating not just because of it was overused but because it was done badly. Did I blame it on T Pain? Hello NO! Sounds like Usher was sour for something and he scapegoated T Pain. Dbag move!
it's crazy cus back in highschool I remember T-pain trending because he sang the national anthem and everyone was extremely impressed with his real voice. T-pain uses autotune and so does literally almost every mainstream artist.  T-pain made bops and anyone who disagrees is an uneducated judgemental person who is being an a**hole for no reason 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Didn't he use auto tune to get a talk box effect???
Am I the only one who’s never seen anyone cancelling him
In this house we Stan T-Pain
Did he lie? I stand tp and dw!
D”Angelo you need to checkout what happened when Bob Dylan went from playing acoustic guitar to electric guitar in the 60’s
omg, i LOVE the sound of warpy-autotune. I lived for all the moments in Adventure Time when Fin would sing cause his voice just IS autotune and it's great.
The fact that D’Angelo knows what melodyne is~ has made my whole day as an audio engineering student.
Proof of T-Pain’s talent is literally the first season of the Masked Singer….
Bruh I was listening to T-Pain just a two days ago. T- Pain is alright, atleast he created his own style from autotune      unlike people who use it to save their crappy singing. His songs are catchy!
I'm not a fan of auto tune at all , i disliked it back then an i dislike it now because auto tune has made it easy for people with little to  no talent o become famous on records and it's overly used
OMG, he shouted you out for what you did. What a beautiful human! I’m going to go check out his Twitch, I didn’t know he streamed!
NOT THE 2 RANDOM SMALL ARTISTS IM SCREAMINGJAJJA
Even if you dont like his music come on, bullying the man and blaming him for other music you dont like is stupid.
Hot take with peace and love: Why not just not pitch correct? Just sing. I love THAT sound. It’s all good though, do whatever you want. 😊👍
T-Pain>S-Pain 🐏🐑
a cover of put your records on is popular again by a guy who just sang it but in auto-tune so yeah, everyone who shat on tpain years ago owe him an apology, at least tpain was making his own songs and not redoing perfectly good songs lmao
I fuckin love T-pain <3
Instagram ruined girls
I actually love singing along to Autotune with the up and down and trying to match my voice to it. 🤷‍♀️  I also love remixes, like The Time (Dirty Bit) by the Black Eyed Peas. Singing along and going, “...and I owe it all to you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you-you-ou-ou-ou-oooooh—dirty bit!”  The slightly off-time dirty bit is SO SATISFYING when I hit it right. Off-topic, I know. Just saying that will .i. am is another artist who slaps with both Autotune and remixes. 💗  ETA: His name is written wrong cause YouTube thought it was a link! 🤣
i love t pain
T-pain is my baby and I hope Usher's shin hits every coffee table he ever comes across till the last day of his life.
funny thing is usher is mostly only known cuz of his song "yeah" and T-Pain is known for a shit ton more than that
Dang this was really well thought out and put together. U very talented bro!
Holy crap. I just want to give T-Pain a hug watching him talk about it. Imagine thinking your opinion is so important that you have to throw down on someone like that.  I write books, which is also art. I would never tell another author, “You ruined books.” because art is subjective. If somebody popularised something terrible *cough*lack of consent in a terrible portrayal of BDSM*cough*, it’s still not the author’s fault that people liked it and it became popular in the genre.  MY job as an artist is to put out art I believe in, not throw down on what somebody else popularised because I don’t agree with that form of art. 😕  Yeesh. Calm down, Usher. I think the worst part is that he probably thought he was doing “the right thing” and didn’t think about the ongoing ramifications of his words.  Artistic creativity can be SO FRAGILE, though. I can struggle to write for days if I read something negative about my books, but that’s on me for reading reviews (I usually do it when I’m already in a bad mental space and a good review is easy to ignore, while a bad review sticks). But if a FRIEND came to me and just tore me down like that...farrrrrrk. 😢💔
Tpain needs to watch this
t pain on bar rescue
great one!!
sad thing is T-pain has an amazing voice
People bashing him for using Autotune as if their favs don’t lmfao - like y’all are probably the same people who like juice wrld or Travis Scott and they use it too 🤷‍♀️🧐 (Not a hate comment against those two, I enjoy some of their songs, I’m just saying)
thanks for being decently informed on audio processing lol
TPain is too talented for this BS.
Your a clown
T-Pain is a fuckin gem. Who would go after him?
*sees video title* Uhhhh, surely not?!?!
T PAIN is a legend! 90's baby here so I STAN him no matter whag Usher said.
Nuuuuuuuu, he said “expresso” 😓💔 D’Angelo why
Usher’s comment is def giving “I’m not as popular as I used to be and it OBVIOUSLY can’t be because I’M doing something wrong, so WHOS FAULT is it?” & then he just blamed T-Pain.
But T-Pain can actually sing so how is it his fault he cant be blamed for other people's actions that's why there will always be a difference between studio and live singers
Ah, the good old days when talent was raw!!!!
Poor T-Pain 💔
T-Pain is awesome! Saw him live when he came to my uni + he's so nice + cool!!!!
I have such a visceral reaction to that Cher song. When I was a kid I was in a local cheer league and every team in the region used that song for their competition performances
T-Pain was the best part of "I'm on a Boat"
when people don't understand something their first reaction is to just hate it without thinking of any nuance about it and it sucks that that's how life is because instead of trying to understand something better, they just double down on their "I don't get it so I don't like it" philosophy that really is incredibly childish
Not t-pains fault that his songs were banging
T-Pain is actually a pretty good singer. The fact that people hate on him for using Auto Tune makes me mad. We haven’t had a new album because of those idiots, and fuck Usher.
*sees title  T-Pain slander AGAIN?!? Haven't we all agreed he has an amazing voice and the autotune thing was plain harassment? Can we get new discourse please?
d’angelo be like: defending t-pain online isn’t enough. i need a gun
I never liked Usher I mean he took his X kids away when she lost 1 of the kids but at this point u can’t “cancel “ the 1 and only T-pain
I love your music commentary I hope you do more of it.
Autotune been topping the charts for over a 2 decades and now it's bad!?😆 Also I hate this guys voice.
I’m an audio engineer and producer, and I agree with what your saying it’s on everything. That process is exactly what we do it’s called an plugin chain. And yes I bounce and listen to the same song on like 7 different systems/medians before it’s sent out. 😭
I’m living at the fact you mentioned Zapp
Am I the only one who remembers NB Ridaz?
I will hear no T-Pain slander…his tiny desk concert was insane and he seems like such a sensitive dude despite his musical subject matter. it’s an artist persona

I loooovvveee your sweatshirt,,, it’s so cute,,,where did you get it? 🥺
People on Twitter are dumb.
At this point all my social media dramas info comes from tiktok and D’angelo
Usher what are you on you’re not that good either so immanently STFU
People getting on T-Pain and saying he "ruined R&B" during all this, isn't indicative of him actually being bad, it's indicative of him being experimental and more people should respect that.  He was brave enough to find something he loved, that made him genuinely happy, and decided to try to do something different with it.  He's innovative.
sorry but tpain didn't change music, kanye west did.
Yet T Pain can sing. When he made his first resurgence, he did it without autotune and he sounds AMAZING! Anyone hating is a small minded idiot that can't acknowledge his bops.
All the haters should go watch the masked singer season 1 all “Monster” performances and see if they have anything bad to say about T-pain afterwards💅
The last time I saw Usher in the headlines he was out here spreading STDs and bragging about bringing a R&B wannabe with dreads dipped in maple syrup. Just lame 😒
It's one thing to get a comment from hundreds of people you don't care about who try to talk down to you. It's another thing entirely if one of those comments comes from someone you truly care about and/or look up to. While I get what Usher was talking about, it felt like it was meant to make T-Pain feel bad, rather than simply critiquing his work.  The main thing is to be respectful when you feel indifferent about someone's work. It's as simple as saying something along the lines of, "I'm not really into it, but do keep up the great work."
How tf do you wake someone up just to insult them??? What was the thought process there???
Fuck yea great vid
R&B did nothing but go up and even surpass pop and rock since T-Pain and other artists like him became famous.....the people saying "well Usher was mean but he was right" are the kind of people who don't have any real friends because they think they're "realistic" when in reality they're just rude.
OMG the confusion in his voice and the beginning of his imposter syndrome symptoms I actually started crying
If you want to learn more about autotune I strongly recommend sideways video about autotune
But autotune was in RnB way before t-pain and are we going to forget the talkbox wayy before that like..yeah I smell alittle jealousy
Rashida was in that T-Pain music video!?!?
Saying that auto tune ruins music is like saying salt ruins food.
D'Angelo making the trending tab less shit 🙂
If they don’t stfu. He INTENTIONALLY used auto-tune to exaggerate that R&B sound. “Buy you a drink” is one of the best songs and sounds amazing with or without auto tune. He is a talented singer, song-writer and producer
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNj7onF7uLn-XfBzXUSgpQ
no you actually just hit the nail. people are too focused on “autotune this autotune that” when they could just look for music that they like. if you don’t like the songs and artists so much then why they live in your head rent free 😂
No single person could ruin music. Music is always evolving new things will become popular that doesn't mean the old things just doesn't exist
I don't like T-Pains music, I do love T-Pain though the man has a top tier work ethic and a energy rarely seen nowadays from every collab ive seen him in, man doesn't deserve the hate.
Anyone stupid enough to attribute an industry changing to one man is a total idiot and used to running they mouth without thinking.
Can we talk about this like/dislike ratio??  33,000 / 218.  Much respect for ya boy D’angelo.   We all know he’s going to keep blowing the fuck up and become one of the biggest creators on the platform.  Very much looking forward to what he’s gonna create for us as he continues to become a massive influencer.  Hats off! 🎩
WHY Y'ALL attacking auto tune? That's like sayin Brawndo ruined our crops, when we all know it has electrolytes.
usher’s the perfect example of the “friend” in your life who’s jealous and bitter of you and secretly trying to bring down the whole time
Congrats on for getting 10th on tremding
Litterally same could be said of digital art and traditional art . Jusy because you use procreate or create digitally doesnt me your not an artist or that your work cant be considered art
God how I wish lightning would strike all of Twitter's servers at once and burn them all down into toxic miserable ashes.
When are people going to realize how trash Usher is?
I hope t pain sees this video and knows that we love him
It boggles my mind how someone can gatekeep an art form. Music is art, whether or not people use auto tune.
This video was nice. The clips of the various talented artists, T Pain's beautiful vocals, D'angelo's positivity... I'm at peace ❤🇧🇧.
I going to use auto tune with the guitar then all of the guitarist are going to say I ruined music for all guitarist
Usher always gave me knock of Michael Jackson vibes 😂😂  He can sing sure - but I always got that vibe from him.
T Pain is still a great one man phenomenal
TPain wasn't the first to use auto tone, has anyone ever heard of Zap and Roger, who's music still slaps to this day! .. TPain is a GOAT in his own way, he dominated the early 00s, *Apple Bottom Jeans* is a early  00s anthem, on period!!! In my opinion it sounded like Usher was jealous.
dang D’Angelo Wallace made it on #10 on trending
can we talk about how you got those musical clips in there with no copyright!!!
lmfaooo the one second clip of dixie damelio is sending me.
My brain everytime he mentioned auto tune: "wae geuronji molla"
there's a difference between using auto-tune because you can't sing at all and using it because you enjoy it
What kills me is people praise 808s and Heartbreak when Kanye was influenced by T-Pain. That makes no sense. Honestly, it gives jealousy because T-Pain came out with a style of music that created a whole new generation of music. One guy singlehandedly influenced many rappers and singers for YEARS to come. Usher is just mad he couldn’t keep up and fell off 💀
I’ll defend t-pain forever what’s wrong with people
WTF? I thought it was already well known that T-Pain heavily uses Auto-Tune, to the extent that he made popular a certain use of it. Trying to cancel T-Pain for Auto-Tune is like trying to cancel Tom Hanks for acting.
Usher? Aint that the guy from the boondocks?
Usher never recovered from DJ Got Us Falling In Love
D always coming with the cold hard facts. We love u tpain. ❤
We never had a problem with him 10 years ago. Tell Usher park it. 145k actually! Go D'Angelo!
I wished you used Nao as one of the examples, cuz that women’s range is insane. Incredibly talented.
If it weren't for Autotunes, we wouldn't have Nightcall by Kavinsky.
Why do I keep thinking about the chocolate rain guy while watching this video? 😬
Anddd now I'm gonna go listen to T-Pain ✌🏻✌🏻🤣🤣
Unimportant, but I really liked the captions on the inserts of all the singers😂
1) T-Pain is a great singer. 2) His TALENT is the reason auto tune blew up like it did after being around for so long. 4) Usher needs to get back in his drop top and cruise off into the sunset. 5) Freaknik Forever.
I loved his work on Mariah’s 2008 album. Y’all leave this mane alone!
Oh yeah, because Madonna and like million of other singers didn't start using auto tune since like the 80s
“Y’all” is such an over exaggeration in this context. Who are all of these people to warrant “y’all”? Because the only people I have seen “cancelling” him have been people that have been upset about things he’s said in regards to his wife (his weird Instagram joke) and working with Tory Lanez.   People and their feelings about auto tune is subjective, just like his opinion on Aaliyah. 🤷🏾‍♀️
There's a good video called "The Problem With Auto-Tune" by the channel Sideways about this topic. He talks about popular artists who use Auto-Tune to create a specific sound (like T Pain) and how people misunderstand the differences between using it that way vs using it for pitch correction to "cheat"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko Link if interested
D’Angelo, this was a fantastic video all around but your little text comments throughout were killing me!! I could not stop laughing!  Also— I watched this after Danny Gonzales’s Inside Tier List video and now I need a Disney movie with T-Pain as the protagonist and Bo Burnham as the villain.
Thanks for mentioning Roger and Zapp….He is often forgotten for his contribution. TPain  popularized it.
Yall remember that Jay-Z song called "Death of Autotune"? Lol. People have been weird about autotune for a very long time. It's nothing new. I remember so many people jumping on the "lets hate autotune" bandwagon.
you can’t bully t-pain he’s a fucking legend - the auto tune was his thing he’s not trying to act like he’s hiding it
Not here for the music drama. Just want to know when and where we can get those B’Angelo sweaters.
He also has some really honest and compelling songs about growing up in Tallahassee (the T in T-pain)
Congrats on getting on trending!
Anyone who has ever changed music in an important way has been accused by someone of “ruining” their aesthetic ideal
T pain doesn’t even use auto tune to correct his voice it’s a stylistic choice. A lot of other singers actually use auto tune to cover mistakes even when they’re on stage and the changes are undetectable.
T pain is an amazing artist. If you've never actually heard him sing without auto tune you suck as a person 🤷🏻‍♀️ BTW Just imagine every T Pain song you ever heard without the auto tune. It just wouldn't be the same vibe. I love me some T pain so they can try to cancel him all they want. Not going to happen!
zoomers are cancer, twitter liberals are cancer....
ok so like this is a serious topic but is no one gonna say anything about the fact that when the weekend and Ariana came up d’angelo  called them “two random small artists idk” 🤣🤣 idk if this is a joke or nah but ima laugh either way
I once catered for a small private event that T-Pain performed at and he was so cool. He spoke with the guests and sang incredibly well - I will 100% defend T-Pain with my whole life. A great guy, a great artist, and a total icon.
Not trying to be rude but I love the way he says sinGing just like Ethan haha
USHER USED AUTO-TUNE SINCE 2001! Usher - Good Ol' Ghetto at 2.25🤔
I personally don’t like the sound of autotune used in this particular way, but then I just. Don’t listen to that music? Without attacking anyone? It’s literally that simple
HEY! FRIENDS!  THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PITCHCORRECTION AND AUTO-TUNE / VOCODER Pitch correction: used simply  to correct off key notes  auto-tune: takes your entire phrase and tunes each note to a scale
'Music' has been around for literally  forever and if you think one guy can "mess it up" by adding autotune to his voice, then maybe this profession isn't for you. 👀
the idea of auto tune at least from my experience dates back to the 1982 album Trans by neil young.
I can’t believe that OMG was a hit years ago I’m DECEASED. Why, why did we do that?
As a Millennial that graduated Highschool in 2010, I feel such a strong connection to all of T-Pains music. Like yea in middle school confessions was a bop but Apple Bottom Jeans was by far the most impactful. Ugh. I love me some T-Pain.
These debates are so dumb because it's clear the people arguing have no idea what pitch correction actually does.  Nearly everything uses it, and even back in the days of tape machines there were pitch correcting methods. It doesn't magically make a "bad" singer "better", it literally is just a tool. And T-Pain uses it creatively so much so he made a signature sound out of it, which is very commendable.
I just want to know where I can get this sweater 😭😭
R&B is life! Masego, Ari Lennox, H.E.R, Jazmine Sullivan, Brandy, I can go on forever. T Pain is absolutely an icon. love that guy! Shame on Usher. That was a hater comment. How did T-pain ruin music? Did he hand out some kind of concoction forced to be taken by all the good singers making them lose their abilities? C'Mon now.
I mean… that music never attracted me, it’s just… trash. It’s not about autotune or pitch correction, come on, you know that very well… it’s about the digitalized voice that is so ugh, hated it. It’s more like pitch destruction.   But I do understand people liked it, I do understand it was popular, I do understand there is a very talented man behind this. I also do understand that he impacted music quite a bit at the time. Was it something I liked? Hell no. Does that mean it’s necessarily bad? Definitely not. Just don’t listen to it if you don’t like it.   When it comes to Usher, it kinda feels like this was a misunderstanding, I mean I can’t see Usher being a face to face hate commenter on a random flight with tpain. He was probably just being jokingly honest. It sure seems to have hit tpain kinda hard.
has usher HEARD t pain sing without autotune??
If people want to use auto tune then who cares?? It’s just another artistic choice. Let him make the music he likes to make.
The invention of photography, radio, television all had the same reaction. Grandpas mad about the world changing.
T-Pain has such a beautiful voice though 😩😩😩😩😩
https://youtu.be/ew1ayvRmwUI🧤
Usher needs to just shut up! He’s NO ONE to judge.
Kinda just sounds like usher was jealous of T-pains success and realized he was being left behind as a singer/songwriter/"producer" no matter how hard he tried, so he projected to his "friend". Sucks that T had to go through that
Lol the herpes went to usher's head.....only logically explanation.....
That Willow Smith song unironically slaps in a very "turn-based JRPG boss-fight" kinda way.
Ok but why is no one talking about D‘Angelo‘s hoodie?! Little B’Angelo and clouds,,, truly beautiful
this reminds me of when you used to do album reviews, those were top tier videos you should make more 🙏🙏
You are one of a kind, Sir Wallace.
If T pain didn’t do it, someone else would’ve. Usher needs to get over it and be happy for his own success as well as T pains. I enjoy T Pain, and he makes fun music. Who cares.
Naaaaaaaaaaaah, I bet you Twitter cancel culture doesn’t even know that he literally won The Masked Singer because he can ACTUALLY sing, tf 💀 Also for Usher to blame ONE artist for something the music industry has done as whole since before T-Pain existed is so wack. T-Pain isn’t to blame if an artist/producer/mixer/engineer chooses auto tune on said artist’s music. Like puhlease, Usher is just mad he ain’t as big as he was before. T-Pain IS a mf icon with all the bops. I don’t see Usher going to Travis Scott that he “ruined” music, whose early music was heavily using auto tune, as it’s his thing with his music, and still uses it to this day. The saltiness of Usher is showing, and T-Pain deserves an apology.   Also, is he gonna call out his own use of auto tune 🤡 🤡🤡🤡
YESSIRRR
tpain is a goat!!!!!!!!!
if anyone wants to learn more about this topic the youtuber sideways has a very in depth video about autotune that i highly recommend!!
i really liked this video! would love to see more music-centered videos from you, i feel like you hit the nail on the head about the complexities of this argument. i liked that you likened it back to electric guitars, i think it goes to show people are always suspicious of new innovations & technology surrounding art/music/media that they feel is 'taking the human touch out of it,' when really all it is is another tool that allows us to progress and refine our art in more ways than before. just like with the photoshop and auto tune argument. thanks for this
i desperately hope that t pain sees this video
Twitter talking about “feelings aside” when does Twitter ever put feelings aside???😂
Thank you for the music recs omg
damn, top of trending. youre killing it man
11 on trending!! Go D’Angelo, Go!!!
WE’RE ON TRENDING YALL
Some people abuse autotune or use it to cover up the fact that they have terrible pitch. That is very noticeable and most people won't like it. Using autotune to make artistic decisions like T-Pain is like putting some extra spice into an already successful meal. It's not better or worse, it's just different. Not everybody will like the spice, but that's okay. Some people may like it even more. I'm not personally a fan of most of the rap music that I've heard. It's just not my genre. That being said, I know that there are many extremely talented rappers. I may not listen to them, but I can recognize talent when I hear it. It's similar with T-Pain: If somebody doesn't like T-Pain's music, that's fine. It's just important to recognize that he is an objectively talented artist.
Who cares what usher thinks?
I hope T-Pain sees all of this support, he deserves all of it ❤️
so excited for the d'angelo ARG and/or vineyard
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
KC and Jojo?
Hey, around 20:30 I just wanted to say that this felt very real to me as I just had this happen to me on Wed and I'm still grappling with it. I'm sorry that you had the same thing, it really sucks, and just wanted to let you know you aren't alone and I hope we can both process it and let the effect pass.   Also, I agree with pretty much every take in this video, so giant props.
I’ve watched TPain’s Twitch stream a few times when he was composing music. It’s apparent he is so talented.
How is Usher going to say T-Pain ruined music, when Usher was the one who signed Justin Beiber.
T pain is my childhood. I still remember all of those songs when he first got big. I randomly thought about what happened to him last year and found his twitch channel. Hes so great and has a good vibe throughout his stream even though he stream like 8-14 hours, and how he interacts with his wife, friends, family, and fans is just so wholesome.
Usher a whole bitch  T-pain should've told Him "ATLEAST I out there giving people stds"
O.M.G. was the FIRST thing I thought of when I heard this accusation by Usher. So hypocritical it’s cringey.
But TPain can sing IN REAL LIFE tho!!! Usher just mad bc his crotch and lips are burning. “SOMEBODY USHER THIS NIGGA INTO A CLINIC”
We could go down the rabbit hole of things created vs people using free will to use them- unhealthy food/ cigarettes/ weapons/ etc Usher going after Tpain in a nasty and hypocritical way is uncalled for- the road to hell is paved with good intentions- anytime something is created and popularized there will be people to abuse it or misuse it- to put that blame on one man- ridiculous
as a singer.. pitch is one of the most important parts of music but I agree with the other things u said.
i love D'Angelo's more light hearted videos, he's such an angel and its great to see him happy
My diarrhea has auto tune 🥺🥺🥺
Not Roger and Zapp 🤣
IN THIS HOUSE WE SUPPORT T-PAIN
Great shade towards Usher like wow brilliant (not sarcasm)
You should (if you haven't) do a video on Dan Schneider for his crimes against so many young girls
He also makes royalty free music for creators to use, just an all around awesome guy. Check out the pizzle pack if you're looking for royalty free music ya'll.
I really hate that the Music business bullied T-Pain and even some rejected him back then and he couldn't speak for himself back then . Jay Z Usher and Nicki Minaj shame on you for treating a good man like trash.
It's me about to throw this video at all the music snobs I've met over the years as a Music Marketing and Business major.
I rlly hope t-pain watches this so he sees just how everyone loves him UwU
He actually opened the door for so many artists now days
Man, you don't even have to be a good singer to make music. I listen to plenty of artists, some of my favorites, that objectively don't have "good" voices or sing in conventional ways.
I hate rap but WHY would you say that to anyone?! It's rude as hell and just comes off as salty.
d’angelo’s outro music sounds like the soundtrack from poptropica and i’m all here for it
D'Angelo completely erased my fear of looking bad with braces on. He is a stunning king and as a lesbian I never thought I would type those words-
My guy pronounces singing exactly like Ethan Klein 😅
Somebody USHER this man into a clinic 🙄
Legends defending legends
Thought he was a bit
In a way RnB is no longer the same not because of T-pain. It's not as trending like it used to be during the 90's. Beyonce sucks now... but people still like her because her music had changed to a more hippie theater style. Because some artist want to do other styles. Anyways, folks are now enjoying music from other countries... Because music from USA/Americas is no longer the same. Yes there are good Artists you just have to search for them.
It’s the summer bro why you still dressing like that
OK THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING GIVEON I ACTUALLY HADNT HEARD.  Queue me falling into a bed of roses
twigs gave me goosebumps
13:51 *two random small artists idk* killed me
Have these n*ggas not actually hear T-pain sing? He’s honestly good, screw Twitter for this
I want you to make a spotify playlist T___T
T-Pain has a wonderful voice without auto tune wtf.
Usher, The Man Who Paid Hard Working Exotic Dancers In Fake Money, Has An Opinion? Please Excuse Me While I Wholeheartedly Ignore It. I've Always Adored T-Pain, And The Man Can SING! He Did A Mashup With Kurt Hugo Schneider A Few Years Back And It's GORGEOUS.
Popular song, California Love with Roger Troutman, Tupac and Dr. Dre....Duh
Just like imagine having the audacity to say something like that to someone?? Idk dude why are people rude for no reason?
Some people: R&B is dead! Me, an EXO fan: ?????
What about The Master Roger Troutman and Zapp
T-pain 👏is like shrek 👏 he will 👏ALWAYS👏 be relevant 👏
whyd you not credit sideways' autotune video lol
A world without T-Pain would be a sad world indeed. I CANNOT IMAGINE, NOT LISTENING TO BUY U A DRANK AT 11!! 😭😩🤌🏻  I love T-Pain and he has a beautiful voice with AND without auto tune. And in my opinion he seems like a really genuine, and nice person.
Guess I'm gonna go listen to tons of T Pain
I know we all joked that T Pain used too much auto tune but there is no justification to say that he “ruined” music is asinine. That is absolutely ignorant.
Imagine ruining real women’s lives with incurable stds and then having the gall to call someone else out for “ruining music”  because they use auto tune.. ok
Go👏off👏king👑✨
Btw even before Roger and Zap, there was Pete Drake with his steel talking guitar, search up pete drake forever :3! Super neat.
YES MASEGO IS UBNMATCHEDDD
T-Pain is talented and a nerd and as such I will Stan him for as long as possible.  Nuff said.
getting a THIRD silver plaque for a channel that hasn't uploaded anything yet is absolutely iconic and we love to see it
I HAAAAAAAATTTEDDDD THAT DAMN OMG SONG 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
So did the BeeGees ruin music because they decided to sing in a higher register? Lol Usher trippin
What pisses me off about this is the fact that rappers used autotune more prevalently then singers did. The singers have ALWAYS had their voices edited. Usher was hatin like a mfer and the fact that people didn't realize T-Pain could really sing until like 7 years ago, shows they didn't really listen to T-Pain except for his singles.
But he can still sing without it and rap soooo
theres so many good singers. We the audience are who make whomever popular. So I dont get it, ya'll have the power and you choose to listen to "trash" music rather than support more underrated artists.
I think you hit the nail on the head by pointing out that a lot of people don't know that "thing I don't like" doesn't equal "thing is BAD"
Instead of pointing a finger and saying music is ruined usher could just get better at making music
You must understand...human  have character...robots do not unless programmed by a human...no one wants to hear a robot sing...we are human first...lol
T-pain a cool guy. He got a style,  personality, and a great voice. What else do ya need?
What a horrible thing to say to someone, especially a friend, he didn't ruin anything. I don't even like what people call the auto-tune-voice, there's nothing wrong with it tho. I just usually dislike the sound of it, it's just a matter of what I prefer. So I just listen to other stuff. Even when it was at it's height of popularity, it was still easy just to listen to something else. Shame on Usher and anyone that even entertains the same thought. Bleh!
May present to Usher mumble rap?
you have made these points perfectly and you are exactly correct
This is legitimately messed up. All hail Auto Tune.
What an ASSHOLE. so just because something became popular and ushers music wasn’t he’s got pissy
T-pain really doesn't deserve this shit, autotune or not he's an amazing lyricist, singer and an amazing producer, you don't have to enjoy his music to appreciate his talent...  Wow Usher is really dunking on himself here cause anything we can pick apart in tpains discography I'm sure we could all pick apart Usher's as well if we really wanted to.
T-Pain gives me the opposite of pain
Autotune sounds good, change my mind
dangelo, u never miss
buy u a drank still snaps to this day
Be me knowing Celine Dion use Auto-tune for a full song way before any singer. What's next they used microphones and should all perform live with no way to record the song?
I hope t pain sees this video
A lot of the Asian acoustics were so popular in Asian countries because of how the sounds could be modified
T in Pain 😭😭
It just seems to me that Usher was mad that T. Pain was shining a light on the usage of Autotune within the industry.
Who the hell is T-pain and who is Usher
poor T dont deserve this pain</3
D’Angelo, you are such a blessing to the world. Of course, you don’t need my approval, and I’m just a random person, but I really appreciate you taking time out of your life to share your heart with us on different topics. It feels nice to know such a genuinely kind person is out there making content and has such a compassionate heart for other people. I’ve noticed this with every one of the videos I’ve seen from you, and just feel like you might want to know you are appreciated. Thanks, D’Angelo, for normalizing kindness and empathy. ❤️
Jeez damn I haven't heard anything about T-Pain in years and now that I am, people are upset at home for ways that dumb child me would've been back in 2005.  I don't know that much about T-Pain or his music, but he absolutely doesn't deserve any abuse for choosing to use a digital tool to stylize his voice. People on Twitter are absurd.
They apparently didn't see him win The Masked Singer with his natural vocals and it shows 😅
ugh i love d'angelo wallace he never misses
how is usher going to say t-pain ruined music when he had fuckin WILL-I-AM, an autotuned musician, on one or two of his songs?? make it make sense...he's just ugly and bitter, and seeing t-pain betrayed and heartbroken hurt me 💔 that man is one of those responsible for my childhood, tf
UGH CHLOE IS SO FUCKING AMAZING IM SCREAMING
As a music professional, I feel like your guitar analogy was perfect. People apply all kinds of WILD effects to guitars the same as your voice. Great video!
…did people not watch the ‘this is pop’ special after seeing the tweets and wanting the whole story?!
I’m so happy you are feeling happier, but regardless just seeing you posted in my notifs always brightens up my day :)
Rap that uses autotune is _terrible_ ! Let’s put it this way: T-Pain and all the rappers today cannot even hold a candle to _Nas_ , _Wu_ _Tang_ _Clan_ , _Method_ _Man_ , _BIG_ , _Big_ _L_ & _LL_ _Cool_ _J_
What about Gorillaz? They use it a lot. And their voices constantly change, yet nobody is blaming them for ruining music. Auto tune is a tool. Thats like saying the electric guitar is ruining instrument...
So even if what Usher was saying was true what did he expect to gain by waking him out of his sleep and telling him that? Like he wanted T-Pain to erase his music from the surface of the earth and delete everyone's memory of it or...? You can't tell me that wasn't malicious
Seriously? T-pain popularized auto tune and he’s getting canceled for it years later? Get outta here…
I dont like autotune and i dont really listen to t pain buuuut no one can ruin music. Like... Other music exists? Go find it?   If you think someone or something has ruined an art form it says more about your laziness than anything else in the scenario  ETA hearing tpain unfiltered hes going on the "dream combo with hozier" list
Can’t believe ppl r coming for Teddy Pain?! Ok just say you hate good music, it’d waste less time
how can you be so mean to a guy who made a whole banger about celebrating dog birthdays 😭
Just listened to T-Pain on Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me podcast, highly recommend!!
The fact that people are saying he’s ruined music is INSANE for the reasons d’angelo said, but ALSO the fact that THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF COMBINATIONS OF TUNING. We use a system that makes every note equal to another, but there are versions of scales where an octave is 43 tones, 17 tones, etc. auto tune is a version of the current tuning we use now (equal temperament) where it just tunes to the nearest hertz. The fact that people are pressed that it just tunes your voice to the nearest note is just....infuriating
Does D'Angelo have a music playlist I can stream?? This video alone has opened so many doors
Usher is wrong for the audacity to wake him up, actually to send someone to go wake him and tell him that Usher wants to see him in the back, and then insult him to his face 🙎🏾‍♀️🙎🏾‍♀️🙎🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️.
Y’all LEAVE T-Pain ALONE!
Autotune literally is his brand??? I remember I used to have a t-pain autotune app in like 2010...
I love this video dude
Clearly no one seen his tiny desk -.- he’s so good
the difference between T pain and everyone else who uses auto tune is that T Pain doesn’t use it to substitute for expression.  All these auto tune rappers are letting the melodies compensate for their lack of tone, how people used to complain about drake for.
5:42 I’m pretty sure Adele is using the vibrato boosting feature within Antares Auto-tune Pro. I agree that the pitch correction is indeed subtle though.  -Audio Engineer/Producer
18:42 “sinGing” ??? Okay Ethan Klein
User woke him up to insult him? Wtf?!
Tpain didn’t eff up music, TikTokers have!!!! Tpain is original and has an original sound!
So this man was the gentlemen that brought the Auto Tuned Music genre to the world. Yeah, he ruined music, if that is the case....
Bad Bunny (twitch) BTS?? LOL y'all 12?? 😂 im not old but for me y'all talking like toddlers. I'm surprised you lot know who usher is
i love u
Are you wearing merch sir? Because we need that.
Thank you for calling Collier out, the man has transcended to darklord territory.
I understand what he meant by the 4 year depression thing. You study and put your passion into music and probably had more things going on and here comes your so called friend telling you you ruined music. Like imagine somebody telling you your passion was all for nothing.
Bruh, if anything he’s a trail blazer. He created his own style which later on inspired other artist to use it. Usher straight hating 😂
Hi I don’t know if you’ll see this but I would love for you to speak up on oliva rodrigo’s album
T-Pains album "Epiphany" was the first album and my 29 years of life that I've ever been able to listen to ALL the way through.
Uh... T-Pain's main thing is autotune.
Tpain literally did his own thing and ppl mad. The downfall of music in my opinion is music memeing . Taking ppl or music you find so bad it’s comedic taking it and running with it then after beating it in your head every 25 seconds you convince yourself it’s good. Example is lil cherry mukbang I can’t escape it on tiktok ppl started by laughing at her and all of a sudden the song slaps to them cause they couldn’t just laugh and move on they dragged it on.
"Two random small artists idk" broke me 😂
But didn't Usher do a lot of auto-tune songs too back in the day? Like didn't he even literally do one 'with' t-pain??
very good :D
Enhancing already good vocals is something that's been done for more than 20 years now. If you look at techno music from the 90's, a lot of them used something to give their voices a certain effect for their particular type of music. Ex: Dune. I love techno, dance music, and well most types of music. If I like how something sounds, whether I like the artist or not, I will listen to the song. Sometimes, auto-tune can be annoying (depending on how it's used) but most of the time it doesn't bother me and really, who cares. If it sounds good, why complain. And if you don't like the sound, find a different song. I think it was super rude and jerky to tell T-Pain he ruined music. He didn't ruin anything. Put some butt cream on your butt and get over it, Usher. Like D'Angelo says, you're just bitter AF. And I agree, a single comment from someone you're close to, can worsen your depression for sure. People say "Oh it's just one thing" well, think about it. We have to put up with constant comments and actions every day, all day, and eventually, it gets to the point that even the tiniest thing can push us over the edge. It's why I try to be kind and watch what I say to people because as someone who suffers from mental illness, and have since I was a kid,  I get it. I understand completely.
Is this a transition video into D’angelo’s music career?
T pain studied auto tune from the person that created it. He can sing but chooses to use auto tune. If you cancel him, you better cancel post Malone and all these rappers that use it as well.
idk how i haven't seen you on youtube before - video's a banger and got my sub😁👍
I completely agree, T-Pain doesn't AT ALL deserve this hate?? You can't 'ruin' music, it's just based off of your OWN perspective which people all have different views on. That's so stupid and I'm really disappointed with usher, I used to listen to a few of his old songs but I just can't look at him the same way when he had the AUDACITY to tell his own FRIEND he RUINED music?? He has his own style, why did he have to be so petty about his success and make him feel so low to where he was depressed for 4 years!? I hope T-Pain is doing better these days, he really doesn't deserve that.  -  also off topic but 13:48 THE CAPTION LOL
Auto-tune isn’t the only thing that makes a song good…
The sadness in his voice is absolutely heartbreaking.
I was never an Usher fan so his opinion is irrelevant as far as I'm concern. I'd rather have Usher retire.
So are ppl gonna blame lil Wayne too cause he abused auto tune to the max. At least tpain can sing and rap. Which he’s proven. He hasn’t ruined anything he just popularized something that exists.
Usher thinks T-Pain ruined music but Usher is the one who introduced us to Justin Bieber.......what?
Aint Usher that nigga made a song with R.Kelly called Same Girl?
I just saw a documentary on Kanye's influence on Hip Hop and Rap and I believe a comment they made applies to T-Pain and Kid Cudi. Their use of autotune allowed more rappers and "singers" to evoke emotion into their music where they wouldn't have before. Without it, we wouldn't have many of the top artists we have today! They were innovative.  **Edit: That part about Twitch was so wholesome!
Usher was just jealous
this was a really cool video man loved hearing u talk about music and the all the work that goes into it
Usher has a long separate history of being a problem and causing them.
Great video as always. It occurred to me than Usher may have had pressure from the label to sound more autotuned as a result of T pains success and maybe resented that.Not justifying his ridiculous statement (not really a fan of either artist but as a musician for a living and music geek the idea of blaming any one person,particularly an artist for problems in the whole industry is laughable). I mean i'm a singer and personally i'd never use an autotune but that's just an aesthetic choice,some records use it really creatively and i love it.
I went off earlier but, man, this is hard to watch. I have loved him for years.
Usher is so fucking lame bro
I love T Pain his music was and is one of the best and it’s so..annoying how people always have to say 💩  about someone coming up and doing something good.
OMG 13:09 literaly gave me goosebumps
chloe bailey in her low range made me rly feel pride month lmao
T-Pain is still my favorite singing. It boils my blood that people want to tear him down.
Quite a few of the tweets agreeing with Usher are just white men saying R&B and rap aren't real music and those genres as a whole ruined music while pretending it's the autotune that they're upset about
Wait I already watched the video but um btw can you you tell what the application they use when they say "They don't use autotune but they do refine their voice"
It really irks me how so many people go "music bad now" all the time. It really ain't, different music is just popular nowadays. That "good music" you like is still being made. People will be saying the same shit 20 years from now. Goes for every genre too it seems.
Usher is gonna be rly upset when he hears about hyperpop
Great video as always, but can we just take a moment to acknowledge how soft D'Angelo looks here
Yessss So many excellent points in this video!
I have never and will never stand for T-Pain slander. He PAVED THE WAY.
Channeling a very Yoongi side eye at the autotune haters.
I M P A C T
Hey look, this is trending!! 😀
T-Pain is talented and unproblematic and I appreciate that.
I love unedited voices cuz I like the vocal cracks and stuff, but like. Usher can Fuck off with his critique. He's getting his voice edited like most people, just like D'angelo said. T-Pain's sound is more honest.
I quit twitter last year, the people on it do too much ratio, can't get a joke, cancel everything they see wrong or just don't like and they make sure they will always won on a argument no matter how stupid the subject is.
Can't wait to see D'Angelo release his new beauty palette on his secret channel, very hype
How nice of you D'Angelo to give those small artists a bit of a platform boost. You a real one
It's 100 degrees rn but I just got chills hearing T-Pain go into that melisma gotDAYUM
T-Pain DECIDED to use auto-tune His natural vocals are already good but he chose to use it
i LOVE heavy autotune as an artistic choice. there are so many sub genres of cloud rap that use it and ive always been a big fan.
You said it all. 👍 💯
You're always so insightful whatever you're talking about! Loved the video! ♥️
There's a really good video that Sideways did last year telling a few truths about autotune, I recommend y'all watch it, and I'm quoting him real quick EVERYONE USES AUTOTUNE, some people might use it to actually make their voices sound better others might use it like T-pain to add a flair to their songs, but EVERYONE USES IT.   "oh but I don't hear it on this [insert favorite singer here]" THEN THE PEOPLE WORKING WITH IT ARE MAKING A GOOD JOB, you're not supposed to hear autotune, not even notice it, those types of program are made for you to not even notice a difference in the singer's voice. Hating on T-pain for using autotune for adding a special flair to his songs is just stupid.  anyway for anyone who wants to watch the video the name's "the problem with autotune" by sideways.
How ironic that you put this video out after you completely shocked me with the happy birthday you sang to Ethan!!!! You sounded so great!!!!
Wasn’t that usher song hella old though?
I live for this whoooole video!
Click bait to say he’s getting “cancelled”
You obviously know a bit about music production 👍 Future project incoming? 🕵️‍♂️♥️
If y'all have not seen T-Pain's NPR Tiny Desk concert you NEED to. The man is a legend.
What was Usher's intention behind his comment to Tpain? was he trying to cause him guilt and emotional pain? Did he think Tpain could completely reverse the effect hes had on music? was he just trying to vent and didn't think the consequences through? You really need to think of all the consequences of your words before you speak. He cause Tpain depression and got nothing out of it.
Ah yes, the age old “popular thing bad” and “I’m not like other blanks” combined arguments.
Yesss 15:16 that always trips me out when I read lyrics and see a word that was sung so different! This explains it!
Imagine making music in your own unique sound and than hearing another big artist who you thought was your friend saying you ruined music. Imagine having the nerve and ego to do that. That sounds like the most heartbreaking experience to go through. Usher acts like those kind of people who are always talking about how modern music is all terrible and the old days were so much better but seem to forget that there was terrible music in the "old days" too. It's just the good songs that get remembered by those people.  and also why did you have to play this song is gonna get stuck inside your head. WHY
I HOPE ITS YOU SINGING
THE MERCH SKXGKSGDDIVXKDIF
t-pain using autotune is like a traditional painter painting digitally; neither program magically does the work for you, you still need the initial skill!
How can one person have so much power to "fuck up music" ... if it wasn't popular and/or celebrated it wouldn't be out in the mainstream, music is as the consumer wants, Top 40 Top 10 you name it. I don't even listen to T Pain but there's a difference between singer, songwriters, and artists-- I've always seen T Pain as an artist
I feel so bad for t-pain he still seems hurt
Tpains autotuned voice has always been such a unique and fun sound. In my opinion, how he used autotune wasnt to make his voice sound better, it was to make it sound unique and fun
I don’t get why ppl are mad at T pain for using auto tune when literally every single artist uses at least a little auto tune.
There’s a place for music of this type. We have so many genres. This music is just really popular and so it’s going to be recreated! I can understand someone being upset that their style is no longer in the public eye because of this but you should be congratulating him as a revolutionary not be jealous.
At this point I’m letting D’Angelo think for me, he articulates so well what’s the point in having a brain anymore.
He is a sweetheart and has always defended Britney and for that he has a special place in my heart
T pain is a legend and unproblematic, how dare they!
This is an amazing analysis of this ridiculous issue. First of all, T-Pain is amazing. My partner produces music, and him and I had the same conversation, and he said the same exact thing you’ve said! Literally to a T (no pun intended 🤪). Thanks for another bangin vid D’angelo!
T-Pain is my favorite rapper who is also a gamer.
the fact that he mentioned jacob collier makes his opinion correct in my eyes
Wait. Usher and others were assholes to T Pain and MFers are trying to cancel HIM?!!!!!
If you don't like someone's singing THEN DONT LISTEN! That simple.
LOL the idea that TPAIN using autotune ruined singing is fucking stupid. Brittany Spears, Beyonce, Aguilaira, ALL OF THEM use auto tune on some level. Auto tune has been used to cover up for bad pitch for 30 years. Fuck right off.
Usher and his herpes and Ushbucks need to step back and sit down. He’s used auto tune plenty of times. That’s like a jazz singer going to an opera singer and going “hey, because of those falsettos, no one likes our music anymore.”, like what? Just because Tpain got famous on it doesn’t mean he ruined music, and many people to include myself enjoy tf outta of his music, and the fact that he watches We Bare Bears ❤️.
I feel very validated because all the people d'angelo used as examples are people I love lol
instead of making good music, Usher blames on other they ruined music
T-Pain is a national treasure and a musical icon. Usher made good (okay, great) music, but I do not respect the opinions of anyone who knowingly infected other people with herpes. He needs to keep his opinions & STI’s to himself
Que dijo ? Xd
I think you should begin a series where you introduce people to great music and musicians.  I also think the perfect starting point to that series is Jeff Buckley's music.  It is a shame how many people have never even heard his name, much less his music.  He could sing any genre, and i mean ANY genre and his talent was scary brilliant.
Also like the use of auto tune isn't bad? Like icons like Sophie and Charli XCX use it in a beautiful way!!! and they're GREAT
audio engineer/music producer here. autotune/melodine/pitch correction tools were always there. even if a singer takes pride in not using them, its probably incorrect cause audio engineers fine tune them, edit them.... its a part of the craft. completely normal to sound good! T-Pain only took a tool that already existed and used it **creatively**.  also people kinda forget that the music industry changed since 2007? i mean streaming worldwide is a thing now and more independent artists are releasing their songs, musicians don't need a label or a big recording company to back them up.  in other words, tl;dr: usher is wrong.
Yo where did you get that hoodie? Fucking adorable
the being in a tough spot and having a friend who you think is there for you push you even further into that spot has been so so real for me lately. people really have to think about what they do
Smh usher need to sit down take several seats
Art is expressive and unique to each artist. T-Pain’s style of music is his art style. Everyone has the right to express themselves in their own art style.
I really hope T-Pain sees this 🥺
D’Angelo creating a secret channel for a secret project and having us subscribe before we know what it’s for is just another way of him trying to convert us into his ever growing cult
the whole argument against auto-tune feels so much like older people saying that digital art requires no skill whatsoever because it's not traditional
It's weird that I just watched "this is pop" at Netflix. Episode 2 discussed Auto-tune. T-pain is lovely person. On a positive note, his wife is awesome and supportive. It's a nice doc. and I love the origin of autotune and the 'why'  and 'how' it's used creatively.
I don't get this. If people think someone ruined music by their style, why copy them??? It's not like T-Pain put a gun on their head and said only use autotune like how do people even justify that? Same is with mumble rap nowadays. If you think it destroys hip hop (which it kinda did tbh), just ignore it and do your lyrical shit. Why you wanna go by the trend and copy something you feel is crap? No matter how bad one side of music is, it can never cancel out the good side. I think it all comes down to being famous and clout chasing nowadays, people don't wanna be original.
I love T-Pain and I'm gonna listen to his music all day now, everybody comment your favorite T-Pain song       mine is Buy You A Drank(Shawty Snappin')
If the music sounds good then be happy your getting good music
The people trying to cancel T Pain are the same people who couldn’t even finish a highschool test😂
Consumers choose what's popular. The autotune sound definitely shifted what was popular in the R&B and rap genre, it did not "ruin" other styles in the genre. Usher was definitely bitter and projecting.
you used an adele live vocal to illustrate someone that doesn’t need auto tune and i’m not saying adele uses auto tune but just saying that live vocals can be auto tuned with software built into the sound system so just because something is live doesn’t mean it’s not auto tuned.
#12 on trending 16 hours after posting, 🥲 we love to see it
NUMBER 12 ON TRENDINGG
In a parallel universe, Twitter is a mental health consultancy.
Have y'all ever heard T-Pain sing without the autotune? Voice of an angel!
T pain was my entire high school life. Like bartender?! Omg still slaps til this day.
Usher is just an envious piece of shit
T-Pain can sing. He’s got the voice of an Angel. Usher sounds like a shit friend and T-Pain deserves all the love.
17:35
My brain while watching: “🎶 don’t be tardy for the party woahhhhhohhhoh 🎶 “
I watched that whole video and I am still confused on how T-pain ruined music. I almost cried when he said that started a four year depression as T-pain music always makes me happy. Usher.. that was a bad friend moment and he deserves an apology, dance, and autotune song from u telling him how much u love him. I grew up listening to usher who is extremely talented, so I never thought he'd put out any discouragement to anyone unless he saw them as competition. 🤔🤔 hum... maybe that's it..  ok i get it now
never gonna listen to the man who threw "Usher Bucks" in the club, there's no logic there
Would Usher tell the same thing to Cher?
Who cares ?? If you don't like something just don't consume it
N-world
D'Angelo is the voice of reason! <3
https://youtu.be/YASfcY-MARc
Better off cancelling people who make tik toks of themselves reviewing other tik toks 🤷🏾‍♂️
Im so happy your videos got longer i get more of you THE VOICE THE FACE THE HUMOR
I really believe that Usher felt some type of way because Confessions was SOO massively popular then he put out a record (Here I Stand) that kinda flopped in comparison. It was out right at the time T-Pain was EVERYWHERE in mid 2008. Usher was trying to get his record out and was impatient about it. Also T-Pain was on a track that was supposed to be on that record and was cut. If you read the wikipedia page for Here I Stand, you can kinda see that there was a lot going on in Ushers life and changes for his management and such that could have led to him getting in his feelings about things. I just think he may have misdirected his feelings unfairly at T-Pain.
jacob collier
when i saw this title the first thing I thought was who doesnt use autotune. Like honestly the very most musicians use autotune..
I loved watching his story on 'This is Pop'. T-Pain was so much fun and I enjoyed his music so much.
At 9:00 I feel like you got to Usher’s point by missing his point (not saying he was right). But I think was Usher was trying to say was, T-Pain popularized auto-tune to a point where, songs with auto-tune were more likely to chart and be #1 on the billboards (at that time) over vocalist who weren’t using it at all. Every few years there is a new recipe to get a hit based on what listeners want to hear. T-Pain being such a large hit from 2005-2010 cultivated that overtly auto-tune sound. So then other artists who wanted the same success used the same recipe. It’s like right now and all the trap artists who sound similar to the Migos. They created the recipe and now to top the trap charts, they have to use the same rule book.
I’m so happy you’re #12 on trending rn
Actually, it was Rebecca Black who kicked off the autotune trend, and she's never been thanked for it. Oh no, it was quite the opposite.   I don't like T-Pain's voice with or without autotune. His real voice sounds strained similar to Boyz II Men, who  I've also never liked. They changed the game with male whinny-voiced singing. It's not my taste. I like singing that sounds natural and effortless even if it isn't.  We didn't get the whole conversation, so what and how Usher actually said what he said may have been more nuanced. For me as a lover of black musical traditions, the heavy autotune sound is disappointing. It strips away the richness and complexity of the voices. Right now popular black music is boring to me. I can barely distinguish one singer from another, if at  all. Perhaps I could if I made an effort. Plenty of people have favs so they can tell the difference (someone told be that one all out autotuned person could blow). It's just not my thing.
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
D'Angelo: making a whole appreciation video for the Weeknd's album Also D'Angelo when Weeknd was singing: *two random artists idk*
Who is canceling T pain, oh no one? Ok thanks for the video
Deangelo, you are one of the greatest creators around. You’re entertaining, funny, educated, non-biased, I could go on. But you’re still kind and I love what you said about being aware what we say Bc it could make someone spiral into a depression. You’ve got my support long term!!
Bruh all this cancel culture bs towards white & black ppl are absolutely ridiculous
10:30 whats the cher song called? Believe?
I think you are most definitely not the only one who likes the sound of autotune. If it was so, it wouldn't be used SO MUCH in the most popular songs. It DOES sound pleasing, that's the point.
Why the frig is someone always getting cancelled. You people ( whoever is cancelling ) literally need a life.
Honestly tho people need to remember that autotune isn’t only used to correct singing... it has turned into a instrument of sorts as a way to change the style and sound of music and just bc someone uses autotune doesn’t mean they can’t sing.... I think it adds a very interesting vibe to some music when it is used artistically
Seems like usher just wanted to be mean to t pain, i dont know why, but thats what it seems like to me
Bruh I thought T-Pain's voice was just like that
THE DIXIE SOUNDBITE JSKSKSKSKS
Where'd you get that hoodie it looks so soft!?
Iconic
Okay but wasn’t Ne-Yo always better anyways..?
I like Usher's songs, but he can't actually sing that well. I feel it was definitely jealousy that he said that!
I’m not gonna lie. I hate the overuse of auto tune in music especially when I know the person can sing. Or especially when the auto tune is noticeably overshadowing the person’s real voice. But usher was wrong for that. T-pain was clearly making stylistic choices back then. Lol usher was really just hating. Because why else would he just randomly tell him that out of nowhere?
Have y'all heard him without it... the dude can still sing. Hate this new gen sometimes lol jk.. also love freaknik
THE MAN HAS THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL HOW DARE YOU. THE SHIT HE GOT FOR AUTOTUNE FUCKED HIM UP. he went on the masked singer and he fucking WON bc no one would believe t pain sounds like that except i fucking knew the whole time and was so vindicated for him when the judges finally saw his face a blew them away and All Of America. And to hear how fucking depressed he was from people making fun of his autotune music when he just wanted to make people happy fuck off with this T-Pain hate. If you believe that shit get yeeted off this planet. I like pulling out the melodyne fact in this argument too. Thank you for making this video D'Angelo.
D’Angelo went to Ethan’s school of Sin”G”ing
Is this a joke cause whenever I look up the name nothing comes up except this channel. Someone help
Usher is an ass for saying that. If he ruined music, it wouldn’t be here. He needs to stay in his lane also- IF YOU HATE IT USHER DONT USE IT
4:31 masako?
The people complaning don't listen to a lot of different r&b, Kanye also used lots of Auto-Tune back in the day and still does, but yeah, there are more r&b artists than just the top 40.
trending AGAIN
Also, wasn’t Cher credited with bringing auto tune into the mainstream? Life After Love? Right?????
This video slaps. That's all I gotta say. Thanks 🥰
there will be NO tpain slander in my vicinity ever.
ooof I hated his heavy auto tune sound at first, I thought that he couldn't sing. Then I realized it was a gimmick and you gotta respect him for standing out and being iconic. AT has been around for a million years and to me, it seemed like he was kinda dogging on it.  It wasn't the AT that ruined stuff, it is the utter lazy beats and lyrics and mumbling. There is a video of a girl taking 3 random words and following a formula and made a song about like...bananas that sounds like anything on the radio today.
Yo honestly, fuck usher. Yeah he has some hits back in the day but, they’re so overplayed and overrated. Every time I hear usher on the radio, I change the station. Every time I hear T-Pain, I blast it.
What strangers say about you hurt no doubt. What someone who you value the opinions say something about you can destroy you in seconds. Thanks for putting the respects T-Pain needs on his name !
5:45 - ive heard that pitch correction can actually be done live these days
I agree with your breakdown of this whole issue. I like the way you think and I think you are very informative.  I appreciate your videos regardless of the topics because you cover issues with integrity. So a depressing topic isn’t necessarily depressing when you use your platform to discuss the issues and the social implications etc… can’t wait to see what the channel is about, maybe how many subscribers you can get on a channel that has no content. If that’s it, it just shows that people like you as much as they like your content, and that people don’t want to feel left out. They (I’m) afraid of missing out. I do like that I was one of the first 100,000 to subscribe, even if it doesn’t matter. Lol
Most of these comments about autotune are from folks who only listen/listened to the radio. Which, counterpoint: stop listening to the radio. Top 40 is the most 5/10 music out there.
Everyone canceling t-pain were not even born around the time he was releasing music. Music is just sound. And if you like the sound of that sound that’s good music. It doesn’t have to be good to others. If someone likes it, then it’s fu*king music...
Usher really isn't one to talk. I mean, where do you get off criticising other people when you actually unironically sang and released U turn? Get in the sea with that shit
The man is a treasure!!! He wrote a song about animal crossing we simply have to step up to defend him as a matter of principle
petion for new art videos may it be a challenge or a speed paint i love your art
Daddy t pain 🤤🤤
If he started using autotune in 2005, that's genius and innovative af tbh, don't understand this unnecessary backlash that's going on.
Its crazy people are back on the DOA wave in 2021. T Pain is an undeniable legend.
as a singer who majors in music industry... imma have to agree with d'angelo 100% here.
I feel like Peter Frampton’s WAH/talk box was missing from our music history lesson.
Kids these days be like "what's a t- pain?"
Tpain is my child hood soundtrack!  Ushers a jerk point blank periodt.
When you try to do the Verb Energy thing cause it looks awesome but they don't give you an option to ship to Canada
I'm gonna say it... if T-pain was a regular white guy who wore white t-shirts and skinny jeans, people would be calling him a genius and would have nothing but respect for him I'm just saying, but that's a dif point for another day. Usher had no right to say that crap— it simply was out of pocket. He cannot speak for all of music or musicians that have ever existed. It simply wasn't his place.
This is exactly why I stopped going on twitter! I absolutely hate all of the idiots on twitter!
but for real, who were those two small singers? they sounded really good
(psst verb bars are really great, I just had to cut frivolous spending) Also if he released an ANIMAL CROSSING SONG? I must pause for research purposes.
Never knew back when TPain first hit the charts that he was only like 21 or 22 at the time? He’s also been married since he was 18 or 19 to the same woman. He seems so down to earth and genuine in his TV show.
11:50 that's actually kind of a thing that happens btw ^-^;; I can't remember who, but there was a folk guitarist who started using an electric guitar one day instead of his acoustic and the WHOLE FUCKING GENRE THREW A FIT People like to be mad about stuff in music :c
What's hilarious is people actually used "autotune" for ages before it was even called that. It was used as a correction tool for drums and other instruments, and still is, yet we only criticize the musicians who use it on their vocal "instruments." No one is out there attacking a drummer for not perfectly hitting that note, and having it altered. 😂
Ditto on the waking me out of sleep. We WILL fight.
I need that Bee'Angelo hoodie please please tell me it's dropping soon
T-Pain looks so sad i feel so bad for him, he didn't deserve that :(
At least he didn’t use auto tune to make his voice sound better. He did it as a style choice. But he could sing without auto tune and he’s really great.
Some of these people are acting like there's only one genre of music. Like, do you think T Pain messed up classical music or is that just not music anymore?
Dude FUCK usher, all my friends hate usher Sending love to T-Pain <3
Before watching this video, I just want to put it out there, T-Pain has a great voice without auto-tune. I always felt like it was just his style preference. He's an artist that doesn't need it, he just chooses to use it. There are artists who took that style and used it as a crutch, but that isn't his fault. Music is constantly changing and evolving, and we should be free to express ourselves through any style we like.
Also, how in the hell are you going to deride T-Pain for his influence leading other people to use AutoTune, when YOUR influence led to the existence of that little pus filled zit on the music that refuses to die named Chris Brown? Who was originally a rip-off of you and had a far worse effect on the state of RnB as a whole?
🙏
This just happened to be the video I noticed it on, but you tend to censor the words you speak, but leave the text unedited; whereas someone like Phillip DeFranco will censor the text, but speak what's actually written. Seemingly both are done for the same end, to avoid demonetization; but I'm curious, as they are opposite methods, but I've been seeing both for years, so evidently they both work. Just an odd thought.
"I've never released music." D'Angelo really forgetting the bop that was the Troom Troom diss track.
I’m so tired of this ignorant “auto tune is bad” mentality. Literally every song produced now has some form of “auto tune”. The microphones artists use on stage have some form of pitch correction. This whole thing is dumb and I’m so tired of it.
"I've never released music" how dare you D'Angelo some of us listen to your troom troom dis track weekly
Trisha paytas’ music is the perfect example of how autotune can’t make someone who can’t sing sound good
Back in the day (or maybe it's still happening), fans using the "auto-tune" excuse to slander other singers just to prove that their favorite singer is the best tho. Idk where it began, but human as most of us born with mob mentality is just assuming that "processed" vocals means the singer is bad and the music is trash. If you like auto-tuned songs, that means you have bad taste on music. That's the general accepted opinion back then. Idk if usher was being salty or just concerned as a friend. But yea, he could've chose different words and wait for better timing🙄  This reminds me of some veteran artist saying "CGI ruined anime" all over again.   Right now "sexy" music deemed as inappropriate. Who knows, maybe 20 years later it'd be seen as insightful.
Dangelos voice is so soothing
Let’s cancel…Bugs Bunny for always get the best of Elmer Fudd  Let’s cancel… Eminem because he cultural appropriate a bag of colorful candies   Let’s cancel…Jeff Bezo, because “Amazon” is an endangered rain forest.. and his boxes are insensitive because the have smiles   Let’s cancel…DJ Khalid, because he is not “The Best”   Let’s cancel…waffle irons, because the refuse to make pancakes   Need I go on!!!
The very first time I heard autotune was when kid rock did that duet with Sheryl Crowe
That's so fucking mean for no reason wtf? T-Pain seems like such a nice guy. Not a good feel to see him sad like that.
I personally dont like the sound of autotune but i wouldnt go as far as saying he ruined music????
“Two random artists Idk” ☠️
I would never lend any credibility to the critique of a man who made an entire album about cheating &  wears an ill fitting grill
That is just not thur drum can't saund bad 15:28
are we gonna talk about that hoodie?
What annoys me is that people overuse the word autotune. If any singer has any type of voice enhancement, production or echo effect people say they have no talent abs just use autotune. When they don't! They need to learn what the word means, just like gaslighting. Gaslighting us a serious clinical term for mental abuse, it's not to be thrown around every time someone disagrees with them.
Oh you must follow Sideways
Usher definitely has used auto tune soo 🤷‍♀️
Thanks for mentioning Roger and Zapp!!!   We’re seeing through T-Pain’s experience that men like Usher in the industry are insecure and jealous of each other too.
not the last 3 minutes being very wholesome 😍
He seemed like he shattered in front of the Camera.
Let’s be honest here ...usher was hating
Lol still subscribed to secret channel
It's not just what Usher said but how he did it. It was so shitty, he deliberately got T-Pain when he was vulnerable. Deliberately waking someone up to say something like that to them is catty and cowardly.
I need anyone that doesn’t know to watch the first season of the masked singer.
Giveon propaganda takes this video from a 9.9 to a 10
R O G E R  T R O U T M A N had hits with a voice modulator HE created  (precursor of autotune) when T-Pain's parents were children; so by Twitter/Usher logic, music died in the 70s. I think not.
I have this weird aversion to looking for new music, because im generally too critical when I'm TRYING to decide if i like a song; but some of the artists you talked about made me want to branch out a little. Ngl.
I guess since I was introduced to to autotune as an elementary school child, I never saw a problem with it. I always thought it was cool. T-Pain is a pioneer, and singers would not use it as much if it were not for him. It’s a tool to change up the sound more than pitch correction to me. It’s not just to fix bad singers. I feel so bad he got so much shit. I remember when my mom was like “how can you like that robotic stuff” when I was like 7 and I was like it sounds super cool. Daft Punk really captured that for me too.
Why do people that are actually horrible get a free pass? Then people like tpain who helped create Low one of the greatest gifts ever to the world are shut out.
Verb energy is amazing!!! Love the banana bread chocolate chip flavor.
Thats so fucking mean oh my goddd
Excellent video! I learned a lot 💯
T-Pain is a legend and can actually sing, Usher is just salty
I don't want to negate from this video because it's very important and TPain deserves all the love in the world, but I'm so curious: what is the background music in D'Angelo's video? Is it from BOTW?
Look I think artist like Travis Scott is really good and their are a lot of r&b artist that use it.
well usher ruined health so i guess they're even 💀
Usher sucks, because he knows that singers have always used slight auto-tune.
He really woke the man up out of his sleep just to spew hate and (I'm assuming) jealously. Usher needs to grow up.
t pain foreva
Tpain was gonna perform at my school last year but Covd AND IM SAD BECAUSE HIS MUSIC IS AMAZING!!! HE IS AMAZING!!! That’s so disrespectful and disgusting what usher did. And the fact that it caused him to spiral, it’s just so cruel. If he can talk about it now then I hope he’s feeling and doing better
Maybe the project on the third channel is to have the most subscribers on a channel without posting a video :)
I hate excessive auto tune and it’s annoying when I hear a good song and then they use auto tune (I’m mainly talking about kpop here honestly), but what usher said is simply not true
When I think of overly done but good autotune I kinda think of kanyes heartless. I still fncking bop to that. I 100% agree with this vid man. Autotune is just another instrument and t pain was just hella good at it.
T-pain is an icon and deserves better smh
This content makes me happy too so uh thankya *sweats*
I'd love to see a D'Angelo/T-pain stream colab
Usher could have just....not
I think the thing that bothers me so much is Usher said something so cruel and hurtful over AN OPINION.  I also get mad that some people are like, "well of you look at this objectively..." or "when you take emotion out of it..." because no, you can't look at this objectively or take emotion out of it.   Art is subjective. Always has been always will. Some people like the autotune sound, some don't. And the reason people like art tends to focus mainly on emotion, especially when it some to music.  And the fact that Usher would say that TO HIS FRIEND is just awful, and in that moment Usher was a terrible friend.  Edit: also Sideways did a good video on this subject, you should check that video out.
i don't know how i never noticed how amazing t pain is before? legit as soon as i started watching this video my brain just produced that one harmonic af song you showcased & then when it showed up in the vid i was like yes!!!! yes!!!! this is good shit!!!!
Wow Usher sucks
I love how celebrities think: "How do I regain my relevance. Oh, cause drama with another celebrity for clout." Shut up Usher.
I love The Weeknd his music is so good
I really liked what you said about vocals not making/breaking music. I love Glass Beach and their music, but I personally don't think their vocalist is very good, for lack of a better word. But the music and lyrics are excellent, and he sings with a lot of emotion despite imperfect technique.
I love that you are back. I've been battling with mental health and seeing/hearing you talk about your issues, however brief, gives me hope that I am not alone. Thank you for being you, through and through. Stay safe and well my friend, always.
Honesty without compassion is brutality
Nah. I grew up listening to T-pain and I NEVER EVER thought he wasn’t untalented. It sounds like to me that Usher was being jealous… smh
No amount of autotune could fix my singing...
Are you serious!!! Bieber is a Goat 🐐
That Charlie or Dixie pop up had me yelling 💀💀💀
Yusss Giveon is slaying
Wow that was rude as fuck.
No one is canceling t pain ever
Dafuq. T-pain was so ahead of his time.
it's definitely disarming when someone who holds value in your life says something like that to you. speaking from experience
at this point you're just begging for subscribers so you. can get more money.
This pisses me off because T-Pain only ever used autotune for artistic effect. This is coming from someone who works my ass off as a “real” singer and knows T-Pain doesn’t need it. Don’t get mad because someone else did it better…
Music is subjective. I really don’t understand why people go after it for the sound. If you don’t like it, don’t listen and move on maybe? The only time I can understand being upset about a song is if the content is questionable (looking at you blurred lines) but otherwise, just find stuff you like and try to enjoy things sometimes.
T-Pain's Mashup video is sooooo good. He doesn't use autotune. He can SANG. He will always be my favorite rapper. Swear, I could be in a whole body cast and if you played him, I'd bust out that bitch and Left cheek, right cheek, bow bow bow!! Usher...several seats.
Agreed!! T-pain is part of my teen years, i'm here for him always.
I was hoping his appearance on the masked singer was the start of his return to music …he did so well!
after watching this, i will absolutely be making a full playlist of auto-tuned bangers.
Just, perfection
*cancels daft punk*
Wow that is rude as fuck!
Usher is just so rude for doing that
That WILLOW plug 🥰
Ok T Pain has a fucking AMAZING voice, auto tune isn’t bad or evil, and I don’t understand saying that someone “ruined music” when art is subjective and there’s no such thing as “ruining music”.
not dangelo getting the lego movie stuck in my head
I personally don't think he ruined music in many ways he enhanced it and got people inspired
Did he say exresso?!?!  Cancel him
Heartbreak Anniversary is a freakin vibe. Beyond the silly TT dance, that song is sooo good.
t-pain has great vocals! u guys should watch and listen to his tiny desk concert!!!!!! uwu
I’ve never heard T-Pain talk before and honestly I expected his talking voice to also have the autotune effect
T-pain has been That Bitch ever since i heard him rhyme mansion with wiscansin idk WHAT the fuck usher is talking about
AUTOTUNE IS T-PAIN’S THING bruh are people just ignorant? Actually I’m answering my own question yes they fucking are.
dang. i thought he was gonna finish "that was the very moment that" with "Usher became irrelevant". What he actually said was depressing af. dang.
THOSE CLIPS OF CHLOE WHAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Ok first of all t pain did not ruin music, he kinda did the opposite. Let’s think here. So auto tune is suppose to make your voice sound better, a lot of people will disagree but inside you really can deny it. Also that doesn’t mean that t pain didn’t work on the music he makes. He still works really hard on his music, what are your thoughts?
T-Pain’s voice is literal butter like Usher we’ve evolved beyond your nails-on-a-chalkboard babe ! ❤️
That story is heart breaking to me and similar to an experience of my own where my now ex gf at the time asked me to make background music for her animation. She never told me she didn't use it and I found out premiere night, the music she used ended up being made by the guy she cheated on me with and she told me to my face that she changed it because "your music sounds like ass and would ruin the project." Didn't touch a keyboard for a solid 4-5 years after that and just now am starting to love what I make again after working with my therapist.   To have your art shot down by someone you thought you were really close to hurts bad and will always make you second guess yourself as an artist. Imposter syndrome comes in full force at that point. My boi T-Pain did not deserve that at all!
Without tpain we wouldn’t have Winston the basset hound I love tpain!!!
But the difference between T-Pain auto tuning and some artists today is that he isn't trying to make himself sound better, it's just a different sound. T-Pain can actually sing REALLY well live.
Poor T-Pain, anyone that has heard him sing live would know that he can sing well!! Anyone else that says otherwise is ignorant.
I'm just out here shocked that I didn't know Willow Smith was making real music!
People on Twitter clearly have never listened to T-Pain's NPR Tiny Desk Concert. He can actually sing without autotune.
I remember when he first came out and everyone thought auto tune was the end all. So much so everyone started using it. Auto tune has given birth to some talentless abominations but that's not really his fault. It's kind of his thing. There are gimmicks I would much rather cancel.
Every artist uses some type of auto tune.  And he has proven that he can sing without auto tune so whats the issue. I mean ppl love Travis Scott and migos and they love dem
Good luck with that project hope your team is safe
U shout out the new willow track but what about my mans syre his new track bye slaps, is either both Smith kids or non
I feel like T-Pain seems like the sweetest man in the world.
t-pain uses autotune as a part of his musical art. he's ALWAYS done this. he pushes autotune to the extremes of it because that's how he wants his music to sound. this clown has obviously never been in love with a stripper, gonna need to take his ass to church.
some artist styles are based on voice modification, and make amazing music and sing greatly. Take by exemple BIBI
Can we just talk about how HD this thumbnail is
Where have you been??? We need more content
Preciate you fam 🌸 You have a great way of putting things and I appreciate you being transparent about your personal experiences. Glad you are happier and working to make others happy because lord knows we need it!
Me, my brother and cousins wanted to be T-pain growing up, like we would sing into fans with flowing shirts and hype ourselves up like we had the actual vocal range to be on his level lol.  What I'm saying I he has impact and the singing ability without the autotune, frick the haters man
There’s a great Sideways video that hits a lot of the same points you do. He explains auto tune from a musical perspective and I think more ppl s hold watch this vid and Sideways to have a lot of their “hot takes about auto tune” re-evaluated.
Also tpain is good streamer
As a scientist I feel the most honest way I can contribute to this is with the following: CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION.   Music changes over time, it always has and it always will. In the early 2000s technology and people's access to technology was also changing drastically. Gatekeepers of the music industry were slowly losing their ability to keep artists limited to a select group of people who had funding from labels. Thus, people were going to begin using some version of auto tune to edit their voices, regardless of T-Pain. I would argue that if anything T-Pain set the modern standard for auto tune; most artists do not, can not, and will not ever live up to it. Yes, including Usher. T-Pain has an incredible voice and he does not owe anyone some weird vocal unaltered "purity" because of that. He gets to do what he wants with his voice and with his creative vision and he does not owe an explanation to anybody, certainly not Usher.
I'm guessing these outraged people never heard the EXTREMELY POPULAR song 'Computer Love' by Zapp. 🙄
I swear to fucking god- I’m going to run people on Twitter over for all of their stupid ass cancel culture over the smallest things.
Naw Usher is mad cause T-Pain stole his crown. Simple.
T pain drifts he's coo and he's a gamer. Gamers be gamin man .
Music is meant to evolve. T pain is talented af without autotune. But seriously people have no idea how many people use it nowadays.
This breaks my heart bc Tpain is so talented and also super kind. I wonder if Usher having his own music popularity starting to decline made him lash out at Tpain. Don't gete wrong, Usher is talented af and has been behind a lot of iconic music, but his own records haven't had the same draw as in the past so I wonder if he wanted a reason that wasn't on him.
T-pain never claimed that it was is real voice. IT WAS CLEAR TO EVERYONE that he was using autotune to spice up his songs. People are acting like he was deceiving everyone and that he can't really sing.... which he can. Soo many other artists use a form of autotune that regular people can't even detect.... because its no where near as apparent as T-Pains songs
T-Pain: sings in auto tune  T-Pain: THIS ISNT EVEN MY FINAL FORM  T-Pain: sings without auto tune
He WON masked singer bruh
TPain shoulda been Simba. Great analysis ✨
reminded me of the traditional vs digital art debate. At the end of the day, technique and skill is all that matters, Usher wack.
I once had a coworker who he started telling me a story about how T-Pain saved him from a life-threatening situation and they've been friends ever since. This was an older man and I was like "clearly, he's going a little crazy" because the stuff he was saying just seemed unreal. Then he pulls out his phone and has a picture with T-Pain, his wife, and kids at what looked to be his house! So if this guy's story is true, T-Pain is legit an incredible person. Definitely the last person to deserve this kind of hate
If anyone's interested in learning more about auto-tune (and how it relates to T-Pain), the channel Sideways has a video all about it  Edit: Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko
USHER said he ruined music? 😶
I will stand by my opinion 15 years ago, when all we had was the radio 😂 many artists did use auto tune and other equipment as a crutch during my junior high years. I mean... even Usher ended up using it 😂 But i do agree 💯in regards to tpain, he didnt put a gun to anyone's head to use this tool, and usher blaming him for the "demise" of music shows that he knows there are sheeple... like himself going with a trend blindly, and then even MORE sheeple that went along with usher and started shitting on another human being 🙄
t-pain has my birthday. we are birthday connected
Sponsor doesn’t work :/ doesn’t let me put in a payment. RIP I tried
Just watch his tiny desk concert and shut the flop up!
Who put Usher in charge? I never approved that.
usher isnt even that great of an rnb singer himself💀💀💀💀😭😭😭
If anyone questions this, go watch the masked singer season 1 the monsters songs. He’s amazing!!
The man did a song for his dog's birthday and it is super wholesome!! How can anybody say anything negative about him?
so dull and egotistical
(I'm not done watching the video as I comment this) didn't T-pain use autotune to replicate the effects of one of those talk-box things? Like he didn't RUIN music, but he definitely changed it.
If anything auto tune brought music to whole new levels. I hate the argument that it’s ruined music because it’s brought so much to it. There’s so much more creativity that goes into peoples music now when it comes to the sound. Auto tune opened up a door to new sounds in my opinion.
It's such a horrible, like big shot executive move to say to just say to a friend's face "you ruined music" and not understand how bad that is. T-Pain sounds great with or without auto-tune, and there has been bad R&B just as long as there has been good R&B, so its just ridiculous.
Never thought I would want to cry with T Pain, but here I am. Also, if T Pain weren't doing that, someone else would, he didn't ruin anything, and autotune is a very fun musical tool, especially the way he's used it on his tracks.
T-Pain is a revolutionary. He is extremely talented and gifted. Usher and the rest of them can sit the fuck down and listen to T-Pain’s beautiful voice 😒.
Im glad he said that about Cher it indeed does slap. I still like that song.
my names emily and i am fiiive
12 minutes into the video you made me feel all 42 of my years. When i was a kid the "acoustic" vs "amped" guitar "war" was still going on. And yes... rock was getting a lot of bad rap because it started using amped guitars that could use distortions. Sooo your video just made me feel 35 years younger until you reminded me i totally was not. 😂🤪 Identical arguments. Anyway... thanks.
Tpain uses auto tune as an instrument to give complexity to the sound itself. It’s technically not even auto tune but that’s a different convo. It’s just that it doesn’t replace his voice, it just adds an additional musical component. So tpain is one of the few people who not only writes lyrics but full on composes music on a technical level too. Like buy you a drink would have a completely different vibe without auto tune because auto tune is an intentional vibe/choice. And if you just follow the guy, you can literally see that he casually makes instruments out of anything.    It’s not tpain’s fault he’s a genius. And it’s not his fault other people use auto tune to be deceptive. Auto tune doesn’t even work like that, tbh. In all honesty, T-pain’s auto tune is more complex than most of Ushers single
It’s an annoying critique because auto tune doesn’t mean the artist can’t sing. It’s a style choice and usher is just salty that a style different than his own became preferred. It’s the “back in my day we liked *real* music” cliche. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t make it a problem. It just breaks my heart that usher’s opinion had such an impact on him :’(
the thing is literally every non-indie artist uses some form of pitch correction. Thats why mr removed videos are so popular
I personally despise autotune but would I disrespect an artist like that over using it? No, tf
Gonna go listen to a bunch of tpain after I finish watching this
D’Angelo: “People on twitter…..” My mind: I’m so fucking glad I got off twitter
The fact that both Griff AND Shamir were used as examples made me so happy, they're both so talented🥰
Have these kids ever heard of Roger Troutman
He has great points but some are not exactly true. I wish i could write a way longer reply. But people really have no idea what level of manipulation and straight up automation is being used in the pop music and especially the general rap community. Obviously not all since there are real musicians doing their songs from start to finish. BUT the amount of ghost writing, software, and other people's hands on a single pop song is insane. They don't need musicians anymore they need actors to lip sync. Drake is a great example of a completely fake musician who never writes a complete song. Also the difference between autotune and pitch correction is too little to make a big technical difference. I have a vocoder that only uses pitch correction over the key and layers.
People on Twitter.  That’s it. That’s the sentence.
Tpain has a beautiful voice though. Screw usher fake money giving @$$
this is all so crazy to me like its musicc if it sounds good it sounds good its good music, everyones gonna have their own opinion but who cares if someone uses autotune obviously and honestly, once or all the time, its just a stylistic choice...
I've always felt Usher was a giant asshole, especially seeing him on The Voice. Fuck him.
everything wrong in the world is justin beiber’s fault
Being part of the first 100k made my 2021 Lmao  Also. Tpain > usher
he,,,has been singing with autotune for literal years and now its a problem?? Twitter really is full of nutcases
@16:46 and this is why usher said what he said, becuase T Pain is a true musical artist. also revolver is one of my fav albums ^_^
Wow really. T pain is a legend jealousy is sad
This is why I love Roomie (Roomieofficial), he taught me the importance of auto tune in the industry. If you don't like it, it's fine but, to bash people this hard for creating things they clearly enjoy. The "classical people" are just not searching or even giving a chance to modern music.
NO WE NOT CANCELLING T-PAIN  OKAY?
The AUDACITY to wake me up to TELL ME TO WALK TO YOU to tell me this NONSENSE 😭😭💔
Lol! The cheater who impregnated the woman he was cheating what, threw shade based on his insecurities? Who would of thunk it?! 🤔
literally listen to one sza song if u think autotune ruined music.
I'm finishing up a bachelor's in music production right now, and I can confirm this is 100% true. Pitch correction or autotune is used in any and every genre of music these days, especially since programs like Logic and Ableton (hell even Garage Band) are readily available to anyone who wants to take the time to learn how to use it. Even though some artist require more of it than others, it's the engineer's job to get the "perfect" take, so a lot of times in modern music, what you're actually hearing is something that (visually speaking) is so surgical it's insane - I've been in sessions before where the vocalist and engineer will repeat a phrase 10 times just for the slightest difference in pronunciation for one word, and then mix it into the final product. The simple truth of music production these days is that we want that perfect, first take sound but we still want human elements mixed in, which is why if you listen closely you'll hear the artist taking a breath or so in between sections. T-Pain found a niche in an otherwise oversaturated market, and now it's what he's known for. With how hard it is to break out into the music industry and achieve the amount of success he has, it's commendable more than anything else.
Everyone: complaining about auto tune  Me: listening to video game tracks ghat are usually purely instrumental
I feel like everyone is forgetting the actual best song to come from T-Pain’s existence: Thug Story featuring Taylor Swift
Also call me crazy but Tpain isnt r&b, excuse him for creating a new sound/style/genre. 🙄 if u dont like it, dont listen, problem solved.
People are canceling someone over auto-tune when there are millionaires from Tik Tok who just lip sing and do stupid dances, I- what? 💀
the acoustic guitar vs electric guitar thing absolutely did happen. Bob Dylan was almost booed off stage at a folk festival for playing electric for the first time. but yeah, Usher definitely is the asshole in this scenario, and I do believe bitterness played a role. And besides, music trends are cyclical, Usher should have just bit his tongue and waited until more naturalistic vocals came back to style. Or you know, written better songs.
People care that much about t pain?
I hope T-Pain sees this and all the comments here supporting him in this buckwild nonsense
justice for t-pain!!! that man OWNED the 2000s and people treated him like shit
Fck usher. Hes just made he was in the back and not in first class 🤣 also, anyone who cheats on Chili deserves to have his dck cut off... TPain, DONT LISTEN TO THAT POS, hes a pathetic little man who has no idea wtf hes talking about. Keep going!!
Usher gave us Justin Bieber which helped popularize ellen so like honestly he shouldn't be talking about harming his own industry.....
Tbh T-Pain got cancelled when he put auto tune over Aaliyah’s vocals and when he defended his choice he said she was overhyped because she was dead, if she was still alive nobody would care about her. Come on now, you think the black community wasn’t gonna be up in arms about that? He should’ve just ate his food.
Wow look at D'Angelo being correct again
We must protect T-Pain at all costs. He seems like such a sweet guy. It sucks to hear how much this affected him.
Who is Usher? Never heard of him💅
Two random small artists lmao
if you like that early vocoder sound… pls go check out herbie hancock’s album “sunlight.” came out in 1978 and is sooooo far ahead of its time
Did we just get willow smithed?
Tpain is such a wholesome man like that's hella wack of usher to come at him that way. Like wtf
"Jacob colliar is talented to the point of being demonic..." hahahaha
ok but real talk where you get that bomb ass hoodie
A real friend would never do that!  Sounded like jealousy!
I LOVE T PAIN HE MADE SOME OF THE BEST POP HITS OF THE DECADE USHER HAS BEEN A BUM ASS UNCLE LOOKING BITCH FOR LIKE 12 YEARS AND IF T PAIN NEEDS A BOOST HE CAN CALL ME OK
the music industry is just too freaking big for any artist to "ruin" it. if you dig deep you can find so many alternative, new genres, so many unknown artists and so many styles that can fit your preferences. if you don't like what's mainstream that's fine but it doesn't mean the whole industry sucks lmao let ppl enjoy what they enjoy and maybe try a bit harder to find what's better for you cause I guarantee you it exists.
I see I’m not the only one in a hoodie in Texas heat lol  Also who is usher to police music.
Chloe BODIED that performance!!!
Ahh yes, thank you for that wonderful reminder about Willow's album. Gonna hop on that ❣️
D’Angelo is a pop punk kid confirmed
The thing is, T - Pain can sing better than you and I. His use of autotune is not to improve his natural voice, but to give a vocoder style effect. Something similar to what Daft Punk does.  There is a video called "The Problem With Autotune" that explains this.  Thanks for reading my comment.
Every studio recorded song heavily relies on autotune to save time and money. Do you know how many takes, even the best singers need to get the pitch perfect throughout the song?
It’s nice to finally hear someone who knows what they are talking about in a conversation about pitch correction 😂
Wait, most people I saw on Twitter defended T-pain. He wasn't being cancelled more than he was being defended. Anyone who thinks he's ruined R&B obviously don't listen to R&B. Also, auto-tune or some type of adjustment is used by most artists nowadays or
Nah I understand the one sentence thing. My friend once told me that her sister hates me even though we have never met, honestly if any random person told me their sister hated me I would have been fine but since it was me BEST friend, it just hurt. I then started wondering what she said in order for her sister to come to that conclusion.
I BLAME CHER
i feel so bad bc i didnt know who t pain was until now and im so confused bc hes literally so talented?? how tf did i miss him do i live under a rock???
I enjoy hearing you speak. Although I don't necessarily agree with some of your stances, you stay true to what you believe and support it. Well done!  Usher's comment, from years ago now, was probably said without any forethought. If he had taken into account how his words would have been received, he may have thought twice before opening his mouth. Blaming one person for the mass destruction of vocal music is absurd. No single person has that much individual power. T-Pain brought the fun of auto-tune to popularity because people like his music. PERIOD. T-Pain is extremely talented and puts out his music for the world because it's his passion. He is a sincere person who does not say a bad word about anyone. T-pain has chosen to take the high road by not hurling back negativity towards Usher. That is inspiring. You never know when something you say about someone could crush them. Choose your words carefully and be the friend you want to have in your life.
T-pain is life and love. t-pain is the original auto-tune lmao. like who the fuck does usher think he is. yeah, he's got an alright voice. but tell me to name one song... nope he's basically just a famous male stripper... ugh pisses me off. I am not, but he definitely is a POC, shouldn't we be Supporting your other artist that are POC and have a unique(or introduced) a unique style, DONT PUT THEM DOWN
Urshur was jelly donuts, I’m bummed that TPain took it on board, he’s fantastically talented
I don't know about this, I just know my side of twitter was canceling him because he is abusive towards his wife? Feels like a good enough reason to not hero worship a complete stranger.
Also, Peter Frampton in the 70’s did voice manipulation to sound like his electric guitar could sing and he blew up w that song it’s called Do You Feel? (Like I do?). Not R&B, but a cool example.
how many times does tpain have to prove hes a good musician before ppl leave him alone.. obvious autotune is a stylistic choice its the hidden "natural voice" overproduction u need to worry abt
So when are we getting an auto tune tier-list?
Willow Smith needs to sponsor D’Angelo. Purr
Not usher talking trash when he floods his music with autotune ....
I'm a fan of Usher's music but there are just too many "isolated incidents" where his character was questionable. I can't fathom saying something like that to a friend. T-Pain is a treasure, whether you're into his style of music or not.
Honey, T Pain is nowhere NEAR being in the same universe as an Icon. Stevie, Michael, Prince, Marvin, Ron Isley are icons. This boy is just a flash in the pan.
I hope T-Pain sees this video. 🫂
Hey D'angelo, I hope you're taking care of yourself both mentally and physically, because you deserve that.
I think the two small artists.were na!ed the weekday and arianna large
I think usher should be forced to watch this d’angelo analysis
All this music talk is just making me WISH D'Angelo had reacted to eurovision, i couldn't deal
The four year depression remark seemed like a lot to me at first. But I actually think it's fair, given the full context. What Usher did was literally bullying. He woke up his friend (sleep=vulnerable state), small-talked to make sure his guard stayed down, and then insulted him to his face! And maybe this is a bit too much speculation, but perhaps Usher had noticed that T Pain was on the edge of depression and therefore more vulnerable already. But regardless, this isn't really about autotune (not that I don't love you defending pitch correction in music production--it's such a pet peeve for me when people act like it's the musical equivalent of being three little boys in a trenchcoat).
Do people still like Usher? 😅
you can't cancel T-Pain
So basically….. Usher is a boomer ,confirmed?
Honestly people should start ignoring stupid cancellation on Twitter it's really waste of time
wasn’t expecting you to shoutout jacob collier today but i’m pleasantly surprised and it just emphasizes your good taste.
As much as I don't like autotune all that much, I know that it's actually been HELPFUL to the music industry because you don't have to be perfect or strain your voice as much. And yeah, even if T Pain is well known for his autotune, he's not really the first either. The reason why autotune is so popular isn't just because of him, it's because it's a lot easier to a quote now and the technology has advanced so much since back in the early 2010s. Like if you make that much of a stretch then you can say Vocaloid ruined music, because it's LITERALLY autotune AI. But they make amazing music???? And so does T Pain??? It's like saying digital art ruined traditional art, like please shut up.
usher talked about kanye using auto tune too. this definetly made me dislike usher even more, his music isnt even that good
I must disagree with usher because of tpain he created new sound a sound that made the music industry level up and changed a lot with this new decades way of interpreting music. Tpain revolutionized music and created this sound that u hear differently today it’s like anything you’ve heard before. Really it doesn’t make sense like with the whole people and copyrights with their music like wtf
If Usher thinks that everyone is copying T-Pain, that means he was the shit. You don’t see anyone copying Usher and his herpes. He’s jealous
I'm going to agree with Usher on some level about the down turn, but I don't believe blaming it on T-Pain was fair.  I'm a firm believer in that multiple people may have the same idea all over the world and if he didn't do it someone else would.    Half the songs out  have some barely passable singers with a lot of auto tune over a great beat.  Which I never play as a choice on Spotify and personally never buy or listen to unless it comes on the radio.  It's one thing if you sound great without it, it's another thing to entirely rely on it.
Ya know what Usher sounded dumb as fuck with this one... How dare he try to control another artist over a production technique...come on
You cant deny that his music had an impactful change of the direction music took after he blew up using autotune.l
T-pain is talented for sure. Totally disagree on most of your points about music and autotone though. I like autotune when it's clearly intended for the sound. But autotune and pitch correction CAN turn horrible into acceptable (i.e. many tiktokers). At the end of the day on this vid, yes Tpain is talented and usher is a huge jerk.
Twitter should be a place just to post what you're thinking, but then 1 human said "why not show how bad you are with no clues, and just because I'm felling anger".
I've never heard T Pain's non-auto-tune voice... when I tell you my jaw dropped
Is no one gonna talk about how when he captioned “2 random small artists” he showed the weekend and Ariana grande
Usher is just mad because he was replaced by Jason Derulo of all people. That's a L I don't think anyone can recover from
13:53 wow does anybody know who these indie artists are? they're actually not bad, i hope they get more popular
a healthy balance is important :D im loving your content too ^^
i want tpain to see this so badly
Poor guy, I remember t-pains tiny desk performance, now thinking back on it he probably did it bc he felt like he needed something to prove.
Yasssss Willow!
I will always love t-pain. Plenty of people use autotune all the time.. like almost everyone who sings lmao
The passion you have for good music is compelling and deserves its own YouTube series. I came in to the video not super interested and leaving with a ton of good recommendations plus a newfound respect for T-Pain. Thank you!
I do not give a flying fuck if someone uses auto tune ... Grow up dorks
So youre literally just gonna ignore the creepshow art crap and you were a good friend of hers?😬
Of ALL THE PEOPLE to criticize someone else using auto tune.... USHER GONNA SAY SOMETHING???
I guess the people canceling him never watched his Tiny Desk Performance...
Usher gives women herpes.
I’m listening to tpain after this
i love when d’angelo talks about music 💕
I would like to see these people throwing a fit about autotune "ruining" music try to produce an album by themselves. If they really believe what they're saying it should be a breeze, right ? 😂
Anyone that is avant- guard whether it be in any field will get slammed. Then by a miracle everyone seems to be on board. 1984- George Orwell, was published in 1949. He received a great amount of backlash for it. Yet now it is a book that is compulsory to read in many schools here is France and universities around the world.
As someone who majored in Music Production anyone who agrees with Usher is completely brain dead. His autotune is a marketing strategy and it works. Same for Britney Spears. Do you think she chose to sing like that? no. Her producer forced her to for marketing.
i hope T-Pain sees this
D'Angelo could talk about the most depressing things in the world and still be a source of happiness tbh
that grey beanie suits you. i mean, everything suits you, but that beanie especially
Twitter will go down as the platform of bitching about everything, that journalists and assholes learned to weaponize
WAIT A MINUTE WHEN DID HE SHOW US THE MERCH HES WEARING
D'Angelo's one flaw is that he pronounced espresso as "expresso"...
Wait until the stans find out that their idols also use auto tune.
Autotune isn't a bad thing. Not to be confused with tuning someone's voices to make a note sound less flat, it's a tool to make a specific sound, that sliding, unnatural sound. It's a taste, and sure some people won't like it, but it's not like Autotune is a bad thing. What I think a lot of people DONT know is many pop singer's voices are heavily edited (NOT Autotune'd, that is it's own thing) for their albums because there is a specific "pop" sound that is hard for people to naturally accomplish. So their voices are slightly edited to make notes less sharp or flat, but they may not sound as perfect when performing live. It's part of the industry but you don't go around telling all posters that edit/tune their voices untalented or disgraces to music. It's how. It. Is.
The idea that anyone can “ruin” music is wrong on so many levels. Music is literally just a concept the only way to ruin music is to kill all humans because we’re the only ones who can enjoy and make it, no one person can destroy the concept of music. 2nd, it’s all perspective, t pain was just doing what worked and inspired him, he and his fans enjoyed his music so who cares and 3rd of all, the complete insensitivity of these people…. “It was rude of usher to say that to him” why tf you sayin it now then?? Like this dude just said it sent him into a 4 year depression and people were ripping him to shreds goddamn like 👁👄👁 so much for being better about mental health than our parents. It doesn’t count if we get a good laugh out of it. Anyways I’m only 5 min in and I need to go take a break. The audacity
T-Pain gave us BOPS! The giant record labels scouting artists to be their own "T-Pain" changed the r&b landscape. Don't blame that man, blame the labels with the actual power to change the industry.
It’s one thing that T Pain CAN sing like that, which is impressive on its own…  But for me, the thing that gave me shivers was witnessing the ease with which he delivers those, almost angelic, melodies and runs. That’s the sort of intangible that can’t be taught, it’s more of a feeling than a technical skill.
as someone who likes to study singing, i will say that a low range, high range, and clarity or whatever sound youre going for can be modified with electronic tools (ie while i love chloe i am pretty sure her lower range does not naturally go that low live and it's likely digitally enhanced) but that does not discount someone's talent. personally i dont care if singers cant sing live all the time because in this day and age it's an unrealistic expectation esp for pop singers who have so many concerts and performances that it will inevitably wear out their voices especially if they dont have healthy technique (and in our age, most pop singers do not have healthy techniques)  i also do not believe autotune ruined music "for real singers". if anyone "ruined" the industry for "real singers", it's the industry themselves. constantly producing new pop artists without proper training and commodifying people puts less importance on vocal technique and more on desirability and other things.
Not to mention, T-Pain really chose Autotune as an artistic statement and choice, he really can sing without it, check some live shows he does on YouTube he is an incredible singer on his own
is there a list of songs or artists mentioned in the video? since I don't know music
This is like saying Mariah ruined music because she began the whistle tone trend in music…
as a kanye superfan (not a stan or supporter necessarily though lol), who has always credited him and other rappers from the early 2000s for the current state of rap, and who is ALSO not a big fan of t pains music personally, this video was suuuper interesting and i really liked it
People who agree with Usher really try to not be open to any new idea, so much good music and artists are here because of T-Pain (Future, Kanye’s 808’s album, Travis Scott and just most of 2010’s and onwards hip hop artists from any sub genre have used autotune at least once in some way or another). People really have a hard time realising that music, like any art form is an alive and evolving thing.
That Cher shout out 👏
A few years ago, there was a discussion on an Italian talent show, if autotune should be allowed or not. A jury member said that the talent should win and you can't really hear how skilled someone is with autotune. They decided to allow it though, as it was an integral part of the contestants genre and so he paved the way for future contestants.
I don't get it, there are lots of singers that use autotune. Plus there's nothing wrong with autotune, unless they're using so much that the song  almost sounds like a robot sang it (ahem Jake Paul)
well... how do you find good music?
Me personally I don’t like T-pain but really?? Over auto tune?? I- 🤚🏽💀
T pain is so joyful and fun. To see him depressed and hurt like that is hard to swallow..
I actually miss when all songs weren’t filled with auto tune. But I blame Cher.
y’all i need HELP where does D’Angelo get his amazing hoodies someone drop the link plz😌
Lets say you dont like songs which are autotuned Dont listen to them its not like he is actively killing people who are singing without autotune. Like oh u dont like this song bec its autotuned but million of others like it just skip the song u r not the only person who exists on this planet everyone isnt doing everything to please u yk others exist too man this is so dumb
T-Pain made “I’m in luv wit a stripper” at 20 YEARS OLD.
i thought it was because of that psychotic instagram post where he threatened to kill his girlfriend if she ever cheated on him. it was wild. but the man makes good music! anyone who disagrees is a loser with bad taste
Can someone please tell me what FKA Twigs song that was?
Does anyone have the link to the clip of t-pain shouting out D'Angelo? I just want to see that moment for myself
D'Angelo.. hunny.. you are being too modest The PAIN I just saw on T-Pain's face as he told his story.. made me cry and filled me with rage at the same time Usher should be ashamed of himself but I'm gonna let his career do the punish for him Usher.. feel attacked.. you did that man dirty T-Pain.. you are also too modest I'm glad you pulled through and are thriving and shining 🥰
He paved the way for Travis Scott, Future, etc. to use autotune not because you need it but because it's art. Plus, Hyperpop artists. And to top it off he can sing without it. Usher eat your heart out, you haven't really revolutionized anything😍  Now shut up and stream Buy U a Drank💋💅
LOVE THE WILLOW PLUG. YES
T-pain is a sweetheart and very talented👌🏽
Am I tripping? Did The D'Angelo Wallace post a video on a SUNDAY?!
I think that auto-tune can be used tastefully and stylistically, but the problem is that it is being hugely overused and many songs that would have sounded far smoother and more tuneful without it, just sound generic and flat. For some it's frustrating when you like a singer's voice, but you can't even hear it through the auto-tune. When it's overused, it can really take the soul out of a track. However, none of that can be blamed on one single person. To try to do so is just useless finger-pointing.
i don’t personally like his music but like- *who cares?* like people should be able to enjoy and create whatever they please as long as it’s not harming others.
I'm a singer. I've been doing live shows/venues singing covers before making my own music for a total of 6 years now.  Autotune/pitch correction is literally everywhere. When you listen to a song that seems like it doesn't have it, yeah you're wrong. There is. Always. It's not about how good you are, it's about the post production and the final product. Very good singers that sound great without those things will still use it in post.  Sometimes it's even used in live shows together with playback and additional vocal backing tracks. And it's always been like that...  Yall can't be mad now lmao
This hurts more now that I remember T-Pain wanted to go on Masked Singer to show "he's not a monster as people make him out to be" and he wants to clear his image - hence also the monster costume.
Wasn’t auto(or at least what we know now as auto tune) heavily used in the 70s with funk and disco music. They spoke into the pipe and altered their voice through it. Now we just use microphones and even the pipe thing on occasion just to grab that funkadelic feel into the song. I don’t understand how Usher thinks that T-Pain ruined music when he wasn’t the first nor the last to make altering your voice a popular thing. Also this is the same man who signed fucking Justin Bieber the same man people say ruined music back then too! Honestly I think this is just projection 🙄
T pain took more creative risks than usher and those risks have paid off with ongoing relevance. Usher played it safer and stuck to a more narrow style, and his relevance has diminished. Sorry
Damn. You explained vocals and producing so well and I agree with you 100%. I love Autotune as a tool and it is so fun to play with :)
I'm ready to go watch music videos now and I need to know what the heck was that last artist I need to know they're @
"Espresso" not expresso. *insert eye roll emoji*
I will pay money for more videos of d’angelo just talking about music.
I really don't care about t his topic, but I like you. So I'm watching.
The only reason I personally don’t like T-Pain’s use of auto tune is because it hides his raw talent and training which I think is a waste on his actual raw vocals. He’s got an amazing voice. I’m not about to cancel him for it tho.
Usher is a hater that nigga try to copy him with that omg song
Freaking Cher having the first auto tuned banger. God love her
I love you and I love T-Pain. Thank you for making positive and compelling content 💜
ppl are mad quiet about 808 and heartbreaks, how many current rappers from tyler the creator to brockhampton site 808s and heartbreaks as more influential then t pain
I love you and I love T-Pain. Thank you for making positive and compelling content.
In most cases I don't like the sound of autotune, but that doesn't make a song bad. That just means it isn't my taste. Maybe more people need to realize that "I personally don't like this" isn't the same as "this song is objectively bad". -.-
Why people acting like he ain't BEEN using auto tune for decades what is wrong with everyone
13:48 well that’s a power move 😅😅
I bartended a T-Pain concert a few years ago. I live in a major American city and this was a popular, “mainstream” venue, so this wasn’t someplace where wash-ups and has-beens end up at the last line of their career. Let me tell you…….his show was THEEEEEEEE MOST HYPE SHOW I’ve ever worked there ever. It was crowded and fun and ppl were singing along, dancing, drinking, having the time of their lives. That man knows how to ENTERTAIN, and as workers we usually tune out the actual entertainment in order to focus on work, my coworkers and myself were actually enjoying his show. Before then I wouldn’t have gone to a headlined T-Pain concert - but would be excited to see him if I liked the other artists on the bill - but after that experience I definitely would.
This is kind of also what digital artists go through.  I mostly work in traditional media, pen and ink, watercolor, etc. it’s just a workflow preference. Recently, I designed a logo for a business, and I was asked to do one with watercolor/ink and also a digital one. The client’s reaction to the watercolor one was, “oh, wow, you really drew this.”   But I drew them both. There’s some idea that digital art is somehow “easier,” which makes me feel really bad for folks who work through digital mediums.   You guys work as hard as I do, digital artists! Just wanted to say that.
I'd have to disagree with the pitch part of the video, if you can't stay on pitch, you can't sing well, and pitch is very important
"Not saying purposely horrible things that you literally know will upset people is kind of poggers" -D'Angelo Wallace, 2021
One thing I will say about autotune is it definitely has a feel to it that only works in certain contexts, if that makes sense? Like, it works super well in pop, electro, that sort of thing. If you want, idk, something smooth ande haunting, autotune isn't the choice. But you also wouldn't use certain instruments there either. I feel like the "problem" is just that some people don't know when it's a good choice and some people do. And those who don't know are the ones "ruining" music, not the guy who used it in the right genre where it fits (I don't think music is ruined either, just that subpar songs get really popular easier just because of the way the internet boosts up fame. Oh... And you guys ever listen to "Video killed the radio star"? Well that song's got a point too, sometimes song popularity isn't about audio at all...)
Usher just salty😂
I'm too old for this.  I remember when when synths "ruined" music in the 80s (they didn't) and I even vaguely remember when disco "ruined" music in the 70s.  (Although, tbf, that was more about the majority's discomfort with minority representation in mainstream pop culture than anything else.)  What this boils down to for me is Usher's incredible rudeness.  You can have a hurtful opinion, correct or incorrect, but to say that to someone's face?  He would not have done that if his parents had RAISED HIM RIGHT.  ffs  What an asshole.
this is like getting mad at shawn mendes for using an acoustic guitar in his song. im LITERALLY laughing - -
If music hasn't been ruined yet, literally nothing can ruin it. That said, T-Pain has the voice of an angel and we have no choice but to stan. 🙌
Also fully prepared for nothing to appear on that channel and it's all a big joke/you procrastinated on the plan and are just baiting us until you have a plan ready... but whatever, I'm subscribed. 😉
Pitch correction also makes shit easier and faster in studio. Of course this depends on the singer and all that, but imagine your fav needing to retake the stems countless times to get what the producer wants. Just the sheer amount of retakes you need are gonna translate to more budget taken, a longer period of recording, and is gonna wear out your fav's cords faster than a night of concert. All that because you don't want no "autotune ruining the music".
Okay, fuck Usher, fuck these people, we're going to war. Nobody tells another artist to their face that their art *ruined art.* I don't care who you are, how rich and successful either of you are, *you don't fucking do that.* WTF.
The sleep thing couldn’t be more accurate
I'm so upset. This hurts my soul to see him so sad.
Making lighthearted videos where you point out stupid shit is a great vibe. It can also be great teachable moments for not believing everything you see on the internet hahah
Yo d’Angelo is no way a source of depression, he cures it.
Rnb is popular y'all just don't listen to it anymore. Brent faiyaz, Ari Lennox, giveon are here slaying the game y'all just ain't listening to them
T pain looks so huggable 🥺😭
T-Pain always struck me as a really joyful, positive person. How can you not pick up on his good energy? This story is so sad
I disagree with D'Angelo on one point tho -- pitch IS an important part of singing, because (unless you're just tone deaf, which few people are) pitchy singing is usually a sign of a technique issue, almost always a tension or breath problem. If you have those problems, then that means the "more important" things you talked about like tone quality, clarity, power, are also taking a hit from those technique issues. That's why better trained vocalists tend to have better pitch. Ariana grande has great breath support and like no tension. So she's never pitchy. For a long time Taylor swift struggled with those things which made her pitchy. So it's more of a "bad technique CAUSES bad pitch" issue, and there's not really much room to say that pitch is the least important. If you have all the other important parts covered, pitch will come with it.
T-Pain is AMAZING. He won The Masked Singer too. No auto tune on it.
Love this content. Keep doing what makes you happy. We love it!!!
i hate how people keep going back and forth when it comes to autotune. they get mad at t-pain for using it but then get mad at olivia rodrigo for not sounding as good as she did in the studio version which i guess was autotuned. like?????? also i dont understand why people expect singers to always sound amazing. ive been in choir for years and we all have days where are voices are tired and singing is a struggle but people just like to judge peoples abilities at the worst of their best which i dont think is an accurate measurement of talent.
I haven’t really heard of T-pain, to be honest I listen to 90-00’s metal mostly. But nobody deserved to be hurt by a “friend” who lied to his face.  As you said EVERYONE who is on the tv/radio is using some kind of processing software. Roomie has done videos explaining this too!  I love that you are sharing this! Because, I agree.  I am now gonna go stream some TPain and hear what I’m missing!
Guys, Is dangelo an Infj or an Infj?
Well thats it I'm a T Pain fan and I'm immediately going to start petitioning for the T Pain disney movie 🤟
honestly the thing I find the worst about this is that Usher straight up just said it to T-Pain’s face. Like, however he felt about it, it’s just straight up being a bad friend to say it in such a callous way
idk Usher sounds bothered to me 👀 and his fans just jumping on the wagon. tell me im wrong but that's what i got here. T-Pain *changed* music not ruined them.
Sounds like Usher's succumb to the boomer energy.
T pain cant be canceled 😂💯
The electric guitar analogy makes sense but I feel like auto tune is too often used to make a singer sound better than they actually are
T-pain is so talented and relatable. Doesn't T-pain have a show? BYE. Someone usher Usher out of here.
I love T-Pain…things change…evolve…and  T-Pain has soooo many great hits…he is extremely talented and I hate that happened to him. I hope he sees this video so he can be encouraged. Boy I wish he had let that convo go in one ear and out the other, depression is no joke, glad he came out (since he said it was a 4 yr depression). Great video!
omg ur posting         EEEEEEE
We wouldn’t have Dorian Electra without T-Pain 👀
If you got spotify D'Angelo, mind sharing your playlist? Curious of your taste in music :)
T-Pain can sing with or without auto tune. You can’t say for half of these “artist.” Plus he makes good music.
For anyone who thinks auto tone does everything for you I’d like to reference the monstrosity that was Tardy for the Party. Kandi did her thing but ultimately I had singer is a bad singer 🤷🏾‍♀️
STREAM TPAIN
Bro I love T-Pain.
D’angelo fangirls over T-Pain so much that if I sent him a photo of my brother he’d think it’s him, they look identical 💀 face, hair, everything. My brother even cut his dreads around the same time T-Pain had shorter hair. And I’ve never seen T-Pain and my brother in the same room, so…
Everyone should watch the T-pain NPR tiny desk concert. EVERYONE.
I would *love* for him to drop an r&b album that doesn't have heavy auto tune because he's such a phenomenal singer. But it's his music, and his style, and it's not bad. Usher is a dick
Can we just mention how unnecessarily RUDE Usher was to his FRIEND? And that it set off a depression for T-Pain? Even if he “ruined it for real singers” T-Pain was ahead of his time and it wasn’t really considered artistically incredible to use auto-tune until Kayne dropped Heartbeats and 808s. T-Pain’s work with auto-tune was a game changer and he’s incredible as an artist, if you watch the NPR tiny desk concert the man is just amazing. I would be devastated if my friend came up to me and said “you effed up music for all of us” 🙄 it’s just petty and unnecessary and awful coming from a FRIEND.
how does T-Pain using autotune corelates with declining of R&B music?? wth is these people on? I swear people got too much time on their hands today.
Auto tune has been and will always be a big part of music that I always love because of the elements it gives. The perfection or more electronic sounds are honestly something I am deeply in love with. The distrotedness of auto tune is honestly really fun too.
Auto tune isn't a bad thing it's a tool to make your music better. With people like T pain, it's not even a secret it's just a fun signiture effect lol
T-Pain is one of the funniest, kindest people ever, this makes me so sad. He was just doing what he loved. Fuck Usher bro
Do I get what he was trying to say? Yeah. The ability to actually sing is no longer a necessity to being a pop-star.   Not T-Pain's fault. T-Pain was just doing something different. And it didn't "ruin music." Even "real singers" have come to love having to not take it again because they were 2 cents flat. It has become a useful tool for them too.  Also, auto-tune/melodine can only do so much. It's not magic.  I also just listen to live music if I don't wanna hear it. This way I know who can actually sing.
I was listening to this and I didn’t realize how angry this whole thing was going to make my boyfriend lmao he hard core agrees with you
What FKA twigs song was that? ~13:10
I wish I had a friend like you in real life. You go so in depth with everything you do. You must be fantastic to have a conversation with
I’m sorry but CHER introduced auto tune on the song “believe” and she is a freaking legend. I DARE usher to go up to her and tell her to her face she ruined music all the way back from 1998. It is even known as the “Cher effect”. So sit down Usher. You haven’t released an album since 2018. T-Pain released TWO since you and Cher was in P!nk’s video “That’s All I Know So Far”. Where’s Usher at? Oh yeah still crying about that burn.  Edit: spelling
That Willow album finna slap
am I the only one who couldn't stop looking at the dot at. the left bottom of his lip????
Ok honestly I haven’t even finished the video yet but how is T-Pain in any way shape or form responsible for what anyone put out after him? He popularized something yes and he’s a great artist, but how is it his fault if OTHER people began “ruining R&B”
I work @ a pub here in Australia and when it gets late in the night where the crowds are dying out, we play loud music on the speakers. I SH*T you not we played all of T-Pains bangers and (just adding - due to recent covid restrictions, no dancing is allowed) everyone who would walk past the bar going to the toilets or pokie rooms would have a beat in their step or dance during the duration of their walking…. TO T-PAIN. even the old ladies were singing along to his songs with us as they ordered drinks!! This man is amazing in all he does and he touches peoples hearts no matter the age or colour his songs SLAPS 10000%!!!!
Doesn't everyone use auto-tune like it's not that big of a deal fr getting mad for nothing might as well just cancel music and whoever makes such a disgrace of it
Lmao usher is just mad that T-pain created and still is able to create timeless/ageless music that will always be enjoyed. Even newer generations that did not grow up listening to T-pain know him. His music will continue being used as samples to songs and Usher mad he couldn't do the same 😭
Dude, your vibes are immaculate. I'm really happy that you've found a way of creating content that makes you feel better on the day to day, but even when you dig into heavier issues, you've never made me feel anything but hope born of the fact that intelligent, incisive, ANGRY young people like you refuse to be silent. Your COVID video was the most inspirational shit I saw in all of quarantine times for that very reason. Definitely do what's right for you at all times and just trust that you're bringing good into the world, period.
wait till they find out about dorian electra 🥴🥴🥴🥴
Usher just wants to become relevant. He just has a *burning* passion.
Usher was a horrible friend for that
Oh boy, autotune is a cancellable offense? Just wait till they hear abt hyperpop. 😳
Bad bunny to bts I don't know who bad bunny is but Bts doesn't use autotune their voices just sound like that. Lol
I remember it being 2014, in class with a friend, we bonded over t-pain and we were both wondering where this icon went when we needed him most and I was somewhat joking but I remember saying I hope he’s ok and now I find out we were right to be worried. Anyways all my homies LOVE t-pain. We respect t-pain in this house.
Tallahassee Pain FTW
Dang my feelings are hurt even though I'm not T-Pain and I never made a public song with vocals in my life 😬😭
Autotune can also be used in an artistic way not just for bad singing
T-Pain can sing with or without auto tune. He’s a very versatile artists and Usher got mad because he couldn’t keep up and was made irrelevant.   Imagine being so bitter that you wake up someone up and tell them they ruined something massive because you’re jealous and you’re not making moves to keep your career primed and can’t compete with them.  Usher can take his ‘confessions’ to a priest and leave T-Pain the hell alone.
sending love and prayers to tpain
People : auto-tune sucks Also people : HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER
Thank you! I was just thinking that you could compare how T pain uses auto tune to how Troutman used the talkbox! This isn’t just sad because of the human effect it had on a genuinely talent artist, but also because it felt disrespectful to the deep musical roots of his music.
I think vocal effects start to become irritating when something very specific gets overused...which is obviously not the fault of the person who started the trend. Even then that doesn’t even mean bad music.
Thank you T-Pain, we do stan 🥰🥰🥰
I agree with most of what you said but I think that you actually can autotune your voice to the point where it sounds good when you can’t actually sing, that’s why there are so many artists out there that release bops but fail when it comes to singing it live of when they have to film a genius video
Usher really should’ve kept his mouth shut. Anyone saying T-pain has damaged music in any way is wrong. Just let people have fun and make the songs the way they want.
D’Angelo: I have a secret project coming in 2022 Me: “but that’s so far away...” _realizes there’s only 6 months left of 2021_ ✨ *existential dread intensifies* ✨
Of all the artists to mess with and they choose T-Pain? 🤦🏾‍♀️ I'm tired of the internet 😒
.... meanwhile most - if not all - records you hear anywhere you have been listening to music have some degree of autotune... include most live performances. And yes, you can adjust the level of the fx. Who is still clowning with this legend?! Leave T-Pain alone so he can continue to bless us!
Ok personally im not into autotune singing, but i dont go around saying it destroys music. I have music i like and i listen to, if i dont like it, i just dont listen to it, if someone wanna listen to it, then its fine, people have their own tastes amd likes and dislikes
Tpain is a good dude, don't really know his music but I know he's a good dude and usher is a weiner and I never liked his music.
also t pain rhymed mansion with wiscansin hes forever the goat
Tpain... without autotune? Now I can feeel t pain 😀😀😀😀
hey.
Jasmine Masters and Usher need to get together and compare notes.
wow saying that T-Pain ruined R&B is like saying Usher ruined pop music because he had propped up Justin Bieber
But do all singers use auto tune to some extent like even in live
Man I hope he sees this
Remember ; "She made us Drinks  To Drink We Drunk em'. Got Drunk. "
okay but- people need to realise that he's not the only one that normalised autotune 🤨 did everybody suddenly forget abt kanye west ???
Also T-Pain went on Gus and Eddy, and talks about how he puts an autotune-less song on every album, and no one has every listened to them
I know I'm aging myself here a little but when I was a kid my Dad used to play ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) songs like "its a livin thing" and "mr blue sky" for example...ENTIRELY AUTO TUNED. TPAIN DIDNT START THIS. these are songs that were produced in the 1970s and are still played in Marvel movies TODAY. Just listen to Mr. Blue Sky and tell me TPAIN started auto tune smh
T-Pain didn’t invent or popularize autotune. All studios use autotune it’s just T-Pain did it in an over the top way as a musical effect. For a while yeah some people copied by inserting heavily auto tuned sections in their songs (e.g. at the bridge or chorus). But he cannot be held responsible for the fact that people don’t sound the same way on stage as they do live. 😂
I adore you…you beautiful man. Just brilliant with a good heart and soul.
Auto-tuning has always been his style. T-Pain uses it to improve his sound, not to hide his lack of vocal ability.  Just because his style isn't one's preference doesn't mean it's bad.   P.S. Aren't we being too petty?
T pain can sing really well. And usher needs to sit his washed out Ass down
D’Angelo, I’m so happy you’re back, and that you took the time to take care of your mental health. We’ll be here no matter how long of breaks you need, and always happy when you’re back :) thank you for making my life better
So we're all gonna just ignore D'Angelo wearing his merch!!! I'm so ready!!
What he uses is not even auto tune. It’s an intentional effect MEANT to change his voice.
what has the world come to
I will NEVER tolerate T-Pain slander. He CAN sing. And he found himself an original style that influenced music and artists to come. He is an icon. He certainly didn’t ruin anything.
ok but hitting any note requires some knowledge in pitch... high or low range
They said the same about digital art too and yet here we are with digital artists, traditional artists and ones that do both. I don't turn into WLOP over night just by buying a Wacom. Also this is youtube, you can find so much amazing underground music here. As a synthwave, drum & bass, metal and anything ending in -step fan I just need to put on compilations/mixes and I'll likely find a new artist I like within a couple hours. Hell, you can even just search for a vibe you want if you don't know which genre you're looking for.
13:49 "two random small artists idk" LOL
literally Jungle, Gallant, tons of amazing r&b rn theres no lack at all. These people have no respect for an actual legend like t-pain
This just turned me off to usher, honestly what a tool
I hope T-Pain sees this, man
Listen to Tpains song "karaoke"    He explains this entire phenomenon of people copying his style & then turning around & saying he's lame for using auto tune   "Why's it cool for you but it's not for me..... And why you jump on some shxt I did in '03"
For those interested: a related video to this one was made my Sideways here on YouTube. It’s great!
Wait...WHAT???  Did none of these people catch the Masked Singer? The man can clearly sing. People are just searching for and seem to be running out of things/people to cancel.  I feel I am no longer an Usher fan. 🤷‍♀️
Usher was caught in 4k paying strippers in monopoly money with his own face on it
This is about the word aesthetic, I saw a girl on the shorts on youtube here and she said she was making her room aesthetic and it ended up with her just cleaning her room. So with that in mind I found a word that might get my kids to clean their rooms I'll just tell them, "it makes your room aesthetically pleasing"
T Pain is legitimately one of the most TALENTED ARTIST IN HISTORY (my opionion). People are just mad that he's so talented with and without autotune
GuitarristS and bassists use 500 different pedals to literally CHANGE HOW THEIR INSTRUMENT SOUNDS, musicians have nothing but a whole bag of AUDACITY.
I'm on T-pains side here, and I don't even like autotune.
I love t pain
T pains tint desk concert says it all
The sort of people who say they don't like edited singing would point to Led Zeppelin as an example of this, clearly showing that they know nothing.
I don’t know why this is even a conversation tbh, T-Pain did nothing wrong. Usher just be jealous 🤷🏾‍♀️       But D’Angelo, what do you think about Olivia Rodrigo and Sour? We need the advice of a legend.
TBH anyone can use auto tune but it takes talent to sing without the thing. He’s talented and really doesn’t need it , he became big without it.
Usher is just that jealous toxic friend who can't support his friends' sucess
this reminds of matisse who developed severe arthritis at the end of his career and couldn't hold a brush to paint anymore, so he started to cut out shapes and make collages.  imagine being told you ruined art cuz you can't paint. that mindset is just petty and mean and not ARTISTIC.
What I got from this is that I would really like to see T-Pain cast as the main character in a Disney movie… is that weird?
T-pains music was iconic. He’s one of the main artists I go back and listen to from the 2000s. He is extremely talented and it’s evident the auto tune was only to add a different vibe to his music. He is also known for being a super kind nice person. I can’t believe usher actually said he ruined music. Also i saw his masked singer episode and if anyone try’s to say he can’t sing after that they’re simply wrong.
No wonder Usher uses fake ass monopoly with his face on it. If I was a stripper, I'd beat his ass.  Fr tho music evolves and can be whatever it wants. Ever heard of 1000 gecs? Exactly. Don't like it just...turn it off? T-Pakn carried all og the early aughts.
I forgot Usher even was around anymore honestly. He was really popular when I was in high school (a million years ago) but I never was really into him. I like how you went into the actual technique behind this music stuff instead of just being "no, he's wrong" haha I learned something today lol I think that it's really sad how much that comment affected him for so long. Some opinions and thoughts just need to be kept to oneself sometimes.
Griff!!
If you liked this video, you should watch Sideways video about TPain. He’s a musician, and he goes into a lot of technical info about what manipulation can do on a track. And also he STANS TPain. It’s amazing.
@D'Angelo Wallace Thank you for covering this!! I hate when people take out their shit on their friends. It's even worse bc u never see it coming from someone u think has ur back, and I know that's why they do it! They're more likely to get away with it. Watching T go thru that broke my 💔. Usher a whole SNOB!!! U can tell by how his furs wear him 🙄
So what was that Griff song he put a video of?
I actually saw T pain live in concert. He sang acapella to prove he can sing without auto tune. All I can say is that man is amazingly talented and he can most definitely sing his ass off.
Uuuugh so twitter is still full of toxic bullies confirmed
the usher "hit" OMG aged poorly as soon as it was released, a grown man should never call breasts "boobies" in that way. I think it was what turned me gay tbh.
1.) If anyone should be cancelled over this it's Usher 2.) Usher probably shouldn't be cancelled over this either because it sounds like T-Pain still values his friendship and using this to cancel him could fuck that up.  To the people who will inevitably say "Clearly Usher is toxic therefore T-Pain deserves better friends" -- first off that's his decision not yours, second this is one conversation that happened nearly a decade ago. It's shitty af but you don't know anything else about what their relationship looks like behind the scenes so sit down.  So in other words, to sum all of this up nicely: T-Pain is the victim here so he shouldn't be cancelled, but we also shouldn't use HIS story to cancel Usher when that's not what HE wants.
Sounds to me like Usher was mad because he wasn't poppin' like he use too.  Yah'll go watch T-pain tiny desk performances on youtube
look. as a musician who trains for hours per day to not have to use autotune. I think autotune has become a crutch for people who aren't good singers and don't want to train properly. and then they get the credit for all the work the engineers do to make them sound good. HOWEVER. autotune can be a stylistic choice. t-pain is a fantastic singer if you've ever heard him acoustic. t-pain uses the autotune as a deliberate choice and many other artists do this too. I obviously have a problem with people who use autotune just to cover up their crappy singing but to use it as a stylistic choice? nothing wrong with that.
People are still bored after quarantine huh? Edit: Twitter; the cesspool of the internet.
wait... I thought they were canceling Usher for what he said to T-Pain. *facepalm*
I completely agree! TPain is a treasure. His use of autotune did help to define an era and influence the future of rnb but honestly he was just a creative genius in my eyes. Especially given that his use of pitch correction was a stylistic choice and not a cheap cover for poor vocals!
The main thing I will remember from that story is that I have lost a lot of respect for Usher for being so cruel to one of the people who were supposed to be his friend and trying to guilt him into believing that he is responsible for the trend the consumers chose because if the public didn’t like the autotunes sound and so on artists wouldn’t have followed it And tried to emulate tipping success with using this tool
Nah T pain didn’t ruin anything… BUT pitch is definitely one of the most important aspects of music sounding good. You can have all the power, range, tone and  texture to your voice there is but if you’re not hitting the right notes …it’s gonna sound whack.
Me, waiting for D'angelo to find Honsool in D-2.
Wonder how many people in this conflated autotune with pitch correction.
pitch correction is done live too so that adele clip very well could’ve been pitch corrected
Jealousy is an illness, I hope Usher gets better. My hope is that someone sends this to T-Pain and it brightens his day. I would, but I don’t use Twitter...
I LOVE him! I met him back in 2019 when he came to Manhattan  bcs my friend was doing a live stream for him. He's hilarious and funny bts!
Why t pain???  Why not people like 69 that ruined music????
Twitter still hasn't grasped 'art is subjective'
Why does he need 3 YouTube channels? Do you get more money per channel? I dont get why youtubers create multiple different channels
no one can fucking ruin music by popularizing something because if it got popular it means people love it. i dont!!! i cant stand any song that i can hear auto tune in! but the fact that its used to much and loved means. its. deemed good by the majority. which uhh makes it good. usher can stfu
Usher knowingly gave women an incurable STI..anything that comes out of his mouth is invalid. He's trash.
My first thought: it must be serious if a video was made. I’m here to listen 💚👑
Wait— but t pain is demonstrably a phenomenally good singer. Also all tools are valid. Thanks for this, I appreciate your take
Great, now I have the tpain Lego movie song stuck in my head
Yes. To all of this.
I agree with Usher 🙊 no one sings these days except a few but everyone uses auto tune one way or another
Autotune is just a tool.
nah man you don't wake smn up to say shiz like that, and your friend too??! get out.
Also, a lot of the female pop stars who used auto tune live in the late 2000s (and got eaten alive for doing so), had no other choice because they were so over-worked and over-scheduled that they were constantly damaging their vocal cords.
I met T-Pain when he first came out with I'm N Luv wit a stripper I assume on an album promotion tour but only a few people showed up. 14 year old me walked across town so I wouldn't miss it. I was so excited and tried to compliment the album I had listened to constantly but could tell he just wanted to be anywhere else. Being an adolescent it kinda hurt now as an adult I realized he was just having a bad day. The night before D4L (if you know you know) had the same building packed it must have been frustrating for him but he became more than a one hit wonder.
slightly ashamed idk t-pain cause i dont listen to american music.  slightly bothered by the hard g dangelo uses in "singer".  usher is a bitch!
Ok but are we going to ignore the fact that he woke up T pain JUST to tell him that he ruined music, like he couldn't have waited until after the plane landed or at least until after he woke up?
Not liking or thinking the auto tune is a lot is one thing but to say someone ruined music especially when you know it's a huge love for them... If you have nothing nice to say or can't say what you need to say in a nice way then keep your opinions to yourself
lul Usher sounds like a dying cat compaired to T pain
Chances are that your favorite music artist uses auto tune. While I understand that different people use it in different ways, everyone uses it. It is better than recording a song or pieces of a song over and over again. T-pain was looking for a certain sound, and at the time, his music was incredibly popular (the chop and skrewed sound). What Usher did was just incredibly rude and hurtful. I’m not a T-Pain fan, but plenty of people are (or were at the time). To tell someone that they ruined music, especially if that person is your friend, is absolutely awful. Imagine if you had a ‘friend’ who told you that what you do for a living (or as a hobby) was all wrong, and you ruined that profession or hobby for everyone else. That’s harsh. What is wrong with people? It’s really simple. If you don’t like it, don’t listen to it. Period. End of story. It. Is. That. Simple. Being hurtful just to be hurtful is awful. I love Usher’s music, but he sounds like a horrible person. Not just in what he said to T-Pain, but how he has treated everyone over the years. It’s disappointing. Side note: Anyone waking me up on an airplane better have a damn good reason for it. How would Usher feel if T-Pain woke him up to tell him that he was an effing idiot for cheating on Rozonda Thomas (aka Chili from TLC)? Why are people such assholes?
The disrespect started with waking the man up out of his slumber
Lol imagine d Angelo cancelling cancel culture wtf what universe am I in
T pain sounds so unproblematic
It's also worth bringing up the Vocaloid community, Hatsune Miku has been popping off since 2007 and she's not even a real person. And the free alternative to Vocaloid, Utau is still vastly more popular than expected by even the creators because people specifically enjoyed robotic digital sound of those voice banks.
Did anyone else try the promo verbenergy link and not be able to make it work? It all works until payment method...
Bro T-Pain literally practiced and learned auto tune for over 2 years before adapting it to his music so he could make sure he was using it well and to the best of his possible abilities, the man is a legend and usher can S T E P.
Just because something for everybody changed in a way YOU didn't want it to doesn't mean that it's ruined 🙄
I would like to hear your thoughts about the creepshow art situation...
Yo dangelo!! If you like autotune being smooth on a song listen to “everyday” by SoFaygo
I’m gonna cry for t pain he looks so sad wtf he’s such a sweet soul leave him alone😭😭😭😭😭
Yeah and i mean, t pain can actually sing like,  amazingly, without auto tune. You can find videos of his regular voice singing here on YouTube
There was no reason to be so mean. If you don't like a song, just don't listen to it.
What the hell?? And T-Pain is a better singer than Usher! How awful.
t pain ‘ruined music’ when in 2013 some of the biggest artists we adele, beyonce, and ariana grande.... even ed sheeran’s super mellow acoustic music was getting radio play around that time. sure autotune was popular but raw-sounding vocals were equally as popular.
its the same thing over and over, why are ppl spending more time piling on hate on ppl they claim are "ruining" smth instead of using it to support ppl who produce/ perform things you love?
When I saw T-pain in We Bare Bears I instantly knew he was good peeps.
Oh people needa stop coming for Uncle T, he's nice and he streams on Twitch and even plays games with Granny. Usher just mad that Tpain blew up and changed the scene away from whatever Usher was fucking making at the time/Usher wanted his damn money.
Usher seems like a student who is very cocky to the teacher which is T-Pain in this instance.
hEy bAbYgIrL wHaT YoUrE dOiNg ToNiGhT
Didn't Usher COLLAB with T Pain ? Man. I'm with you D, Not T Pains fault that the crappy copy cats, copied T pain. Thats on them. Not Pain. Usher. For real. That dude is one step up from being Brian McKnight. And I'm not saying that as a compliment.
If people think T-Pain ruined music, I don't think it's an issue of not looking hard enough for modern songs.   I think it's an issue of ignoring all of the terrible pre-T-Pain music.
These people are the same people who say “ all music in the 80’s was great” when we also got Jessie’s Girl and Sunglasses at Night.
Go listen to Gallant, an AMAZING R&B artist that came out early 2010s and is still releasing music absolutely amazing vocalist
D'Angelo is one hundred percent correct. I'm not huge on the autotuned sound, so I don't listen to it instead of complaining about it. What Usher said was horrifying, as one friend to another. You gotta use your influence to encourage, not discourage. That's so sad. T-Pain seems like such a sweet person tbh.
usher sucks........Ne-Yo is the king
I grew up on T-pain. He is literally one of the main artist that I've often listened to since 2005  I think people are just looking for any reason to cancel someone. 😒
I love both artists but usher was wrong for that… also the only thing usher has been mentioned for lately is using fake money with his own face on it in a strip club 💀
💗
Did Usher just get pissed he was left in the office flipping copies while T-Pain was on a boat in his flippy floppies?
That's like saying digital art ruined traditional art.
I've got more beef with Usher for ruining music frankly
T pain will never ever be canceled...period
1) woke me up from sleep  2) dissed me Double homicide 😡
When T-Pain blew up, that was a cultural reset and even though Usher was very big on his own, I think he's just that one friend that doesn't allow space for his other friends to have the same spotlight. That's just my conspiracy. Anyways APPLE BOTTOM JEANS FOR LIFEEEE, love this video D'Angelo keep doing you <3
I will also correct you in that people like migos and future RECORD into an autotune plugin, probably not meloydyne as it wont correct in real time. Good autotune vocalists know how to bend and weird the effect.
people be dumb. good auto tuned music is still good music. they really be acting like t-pain created the concept of auto tune to destroy the industry. like calm down
it’s wild to me that usher made that comment about t pain. i would think that someone who’s been in the industry as long as usher has would respect other artists, especially songwriters, enough to NOT GO THERE, WTF! that’s a messed up comment to make especially since t pain isn’t just some random industry plant singer but he actually writes and produces
Love me some T-Pain.
as a recording engineer i would tell a singer, the last thing i care about is if youre in pitch. I dont have an autoemotion or autosweetvoice or autovibe plug in.
Usher was jealous. Cancel culture is toxic. People now a days believe everyone needs to live up to their standards and do things their way. Other people don’t exist for us and expecting everyone to exist by your standards is a ticket to disappointment. Everyone is different and that’s okay. Just gotta live your life for you your heart and mind
People really be out here showing they know nothing about music and music production.   Listen to Hide and Seek by Imogen Heap and tell me that’s not beautiful. (The song Jason Derulo sampled form Whatcha Say).
Every single artist nowadays has auto tune. Even singing live. Just to tweak the performance to make it better. What t pain does is use auto tune as part of his act. Most people won't be able to hear the auto tune usually so this is an actual artistic choice. I'm not even a fan of t pain but a YouTube channel (I think it was sideways) explained how auto tune is used so I get annoyed now when people say stuff like that. It's like the people who complain women wear too much make up and then look at someone who has natural make up on and thinks "she looks so much better without make up"
Not a coffee person? "Expresso"? That Cher song slaps?  Damn, that's 3 strikes, D'Angelo  Nah, but for real, I don't like T-Pain's music, but there is no denying his talent and influence. "Bartender" sounds so much like a lot of modern stuff, it's crazy.
Bullying T-Pain is also like kicking a baby labrador retriever. Imagine kicking a puppy because you peaked in 2005.
Who cares if someone is using auto tune?? If a song is good, it's good. People just want something to complain about and someone to blame.
Yeah vids gd and all...     *But that hoodie tho...*
Happy one year to the office husband podcast 😉
Justice for shannon
Don't hate the player, hate the game. T-Pain wouldn't have crushed an autotune niche in the music market if consumers didn't create that spot. Can't ruin music if people want it, so Usher is just calling anyone who consumes music other than what he likes stupid money sheep for him I guess? What a dick.
I didn't think I was that hard of a stan but hearing Ariana sing that whistle note live made me tear the fuck up. Love that bitch
Sideways has the best video on how people get autotune wrong.
“There’s no good music anymore” Really? Just stfu and stream Jubilee by Japanese Breakfast.
Tldr:People on Twitter are upset because T Paine said Usher said he ruined music.
I need that hoodie!
I need Usher to catch these hands tbh, poor Tpain🥺
Sending you virtual hugs. Depression is hard. The mind can be tricky and cruel. I love your perspective, and the way you produce your content. That low tune in the background is hypnotic. Lol.
T Pqin was great on The Gus & Eddy podcast! He was so chill! You can tell he's a good person
These views are low
The Weeknd's entire career has happened since T-Pain got popular, so I think real singers are still doing fine. I think autotune has just removed having a good voice as the only key to success.
My 4 year old son went through a phase of nonstop Lego Movie 2 allll dayyyy longggg. The movie was just all right but omg that soundtrack was in my head for weeks! (It got me through many, many viewings of it because I loved the songs)
It reminds me of the digital art isn't real art thing.
Ignoring Usher either way I’m gonna go listen to buy you a drank
I know it was mentioned, but genuinely the people saying that autotune is "ruining music" are the same people that say digital art/artists are "ruining art". Like- Jesus bro try to sound less pretentious and dickish
Music is too subjective to ever be classified as good or bad(What might be right for you, might not be right for some), and no one persons type of musical preference or style can "ruin" said industry.
TPain seems like a real gentleman  like yourself 😻
Say it with me people; correlation is not causation. ✌✌✌
Who’s usher?
If all it takes is ONE PERSON for you to think that they f*cked up music/hobbies/your childhood forever, then whatever it was must not have been that great.
T-Pain used auto-tune: He liked the sound of it. He became popular -> People began using auto-tune -> Not his problem, people will alway copy other people
Pp
But also, T Pain has a voice like an angel. He uses autotune because he likes it, not because he needs it. He has a better natural voice than most musicians.
Tpain used modern tools to change his art, it wasn't because he couldn't sing - it was and is an artistic choice to use it to the degree he did. Crazy that people didn't see that and still don't
she isn't r&b, but imogen heap has been using autotune in interesting ways for years too. i stopped sharing music like hers because i got a lot of "oh, bUt It'S aUtOtUnEd." okay, so? it was edited on purpose for the sound enjoy it mfers!
Usher is just out of his mind because no one pays attention to his music anymore.. man, when you suck you suck and that's it, no need to talk crap about someone else just because they're better or different than you..
So Usher’s mad at capitalism and taking it out on his friend?  Because stylistic autotune is all over the place because it’s popular and sells.  Like, are we gonna blame Star Wars for our movie producers’  current obsession with franchises, toy sales, and special effects?  Because a lot of big wigs have invested money in crappy movies for the  franchise and toy sale potential, instead of actual quality.
d'angelo making 23 minutes video on the greatness of T-pain because he noticed the twitch raid      JK  great vid btw, learned more about T-pain's journey from this
Seriously...  I worked as a bouncer and got abused by random idiots for hours, and I used to get in heaps of online arguments and it never bothered me. But when I try and explain something important to my mum and she just changes the topic and doesnt listen its gutting and kicks off my depression for a day or two. It sucks
In that same vein, I think a lot of people give Vocaloid producers crap, in regards to how they tune them? Even fabricated voices can be made to have emotion and a "soul" behind them because of their producers, and I think it can get overlooked a lot when it comes to "what sounds right."
Thank you so much for mentioning Masego. Hate usher’s opinion.
Doesn't Usher use a lot of autotune?
Usher just jealous
hearing this ontwt: me listening to clssical most of the time: 🤔
Y'all tryna act like we didn't bop T-pain and Lil Wayne????
there's actually a famous story about when bob dylan first used an electric guitar on stage somebody in the crowd shouted "judas!"
If a D'Angelo video starts with "People on Twitter" you know it has to be good
Transparent soul😍😍😍
Not some jackasses coming after my man T Pain. He's one of the artists I grew up on, his music slaps. He's got his own style and his songs are great and catchy. I'll defend him with my last dying breath.
T-pain is also amazing at freestyle rapping, he does it every now and then at the beginning of his streams and he gets the entire chat hyped af
I think auto tune is fine so long as it isn’t covering up bad singing, a lot of the time auto tune ads loads to a song.
He getting heat for Auto-tune again? Leave that man alone...
My opinion : music never got bad, it's different the same way it was different 30 years ago.
Alternate title:  D'Angelo ending every argument about music ever.
8:48 I actually watched the show that that clip came from, and that was one of the things mentioned. They talked about how most of the people criticizing T-Pain ended up collabing with him later on, because he pretty much blew up at the time. And even when people weren’t collabing with him, they were copying him.
do people still listen to usher?
t-pain was the first person to choose to use autotune for aesthetic purposes and he does not deserve this *slander* dude just heard autotune and was like "that sounds cool, i wanna use that" he was the precursor to hyperpop
Damn I don't like excessive autotune that much but sometimes it slaps so who can say it ruined anything. It is not like rnb doesn't have pretentious bad music. Poor man got into 4 years of depression because of this like that's a long time for a depression. Nobody deserves something like this. I am glad he got over it.
So Cher made people use auto tune to death (including Madonna!) in the late nineties?
cher fucking slaps
In the end, music is a form of expression, an art, despite the medium it is being made from
Your comment about sleep.. :D I find time but never get rest because of ptsd and pain (chronic illness) :)
How’s everyone bashing T-Pain for autotune after praising Kanye for 808 and heartbreaks? Make it make sense
Idk why people think autotune can save atrocious singing. Autotune smooths out a couple of notes that are off-pitch, not make a bad singer amazing.
I actually prefer auto-tune on RNB tracks. Also, auto-tune DOES NOT help you sing, it CORRECTS your pitching. The melody and singing techniques is the 🔑 to ✅
D'Angelo is such a real one
Blaming autotune is like saying people who play songs on electric keyboards using sound effects are less talented than those using grand pianos. Just because people use special effects or tools does not mean they ruin the craft. You’re not going to be able to play either the piano or the keyboard if you don’t know how to. Just because something is “raw and unprocessed” does not mean it’s better and just because something’s enhanced does not mean it’s worthless.
Ooooh yes, willows song transparentsoul has been in my head non stop lately. It reminds of the rock music I used to listen to when I was a teen in the late 90s/early 00s.  I'm not into heavily 'autotuned' voices at all but yeah that's mostly the stuff with extra vowels 😂. I was there on twitch when you raided t-pain and it was sooo sweet 😁
Thanks for the music recommendations D'Angelo!
Talking about ppl who use autotune and stuff  ABBOTWDM THEIR MUSIC IS 👌🏻 their music is so underappriciated, and they're my favourite musician ever. They're so. So good.
Loving the wholesome content <3
I could use auto-tune and still sound like a dying weasel. Auto-tune is like putting garnish on a meal, if the meal is good it’ll be enhanced, if it’s not a good meal, it’ll just be garnish covered garbage.
Hey D'Angelo, I'm a musician that had a prejudice against autotune until your compelling argument about what it really is. Bravo! and I'm glad to see you back in the saddle.
dangelos secret project might just be the thing keeping me alive for another year  "Oh I got stabbed 20 times in the heart, ouch well too bad I have to live till 2022"
The moment I heard "people from Twitter" is the moment I know something dumb going down
I ❤️ T-PAIN AND U CAN’T STOP ME !
I’m not a fan of either Usher or Tpain but I cannot remember the last time I heard an Usher song,something I can’t say for Tpain. Usher can stay salty,he wishes he was on Tpain’s level.
Usher should have learned to shusher. 🤫 Just let people enjoy things.
Dont forget Gallant!
Wow I loved that video. I think that uplifting content is definitely something that you shouldn't avoid: you are an informative channel (at least to me) that helps people with understanding the internet and some more, cuz let's face it the internet is everything 😂 I actually really hate it when commentary channels make bad and mean jokes so I really appreciate you for usually not doing that. I think that as long as you are fare with your statements and give your opinions as opinions, we all would love to watch any content that you'll choose to make. Obviously said with the knowledge of you *being* you that we love 💘 👁👄👁
Auto tune is à tool, that can be used correctly or not. Like à knife. It you use à knife to cut food that's à good use of the knife, if you use it to kill people it à bad use of your knife. But no one is like 'let' s never use knife ever'
How'd this not get throttled by YouTube's shitty flagging for music clips?
Imagine we shamed Franz Liszt for ruining music because he popularized the piano.  Bruh I don't like autotune but  1. you don't say that shit to your friend's face and 2. music is never ruined, nobody cares if YOU don't like it. Find the music you do like and vibe with it. Times change, instruments change, people change, get over it. Usher being a little bitch and hurting T-Pain at the same time is unacceptable. Side note, people "getting into music because autotune is a crutch" and "not being talented" is super gatekeeping and I wish more people called that out. People don't become talented by standing on the sidelines. If autotune gives people the confidence to start, that's great. They could get somewhere someday. Who the fuck are y'all telling them that their work shouldn't exist and that they're automatically trash just because YOU don't like it? Ffs
The sadness in his voice is absolutely heartbreaking.
Auto-tune ruined music is super hipster  Anyone who wants to her T-Pain doing his biz in a fun way is the ERB Stevie Wonder vs Wonder Woman 😄 it’s great coz it’s just him doing his thing and a great homage to Stevie who killed the digital sound
Everyone: stream Immunity by Clairo
If someone is your friend, there is such a thing as true honesty; and then being a shitty friend in hurting them with spewing your opinion. Correlation is not causation. I need to go rewatch the legomovie If you are stuck in an unrelenting downpour and someone you consider a friend; dumps a bucket of dish water on you, instead of handing you and umbrella. Maybe they're not a friend.
T Pain is HONEST about his use of autotune which has been around since before he blew up. He's just popular and an easy target, people suck.
Umm "the rise of autotuned R&B" was popularised bc consumers liked and listened to those songs. Sorry if Usher doesn't like it but you can't blame all that on one person 😭
I really hope T-Pain sees this
2013 isn't really that long ago
BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENTT
Usher is just sad his music isn’t doing as well as it used to 🤭
Thank you for saying that thing about people just needing to be better at finding good music. You see so many comments online that say, "I miss the good ol' days when music was actually good", "songs these days are only about s*x, partying and drugs", "why don't people play with actual instruments anymore?"  But like, they don't even wanna give smaller artists a chance because they've "never heard of them".  A lot of the time, people would consider a song bad just because it's overplayed (i.e. Baby by Justin Bieber, Let It Go from the Frozen OST). Blame radio stations, not musicians.
People who say ‘R&B/music is dead’ clearly only pay attention to the top 50 songs on the charts. There’s sooo many amazing R&B artists today and great music but they’re just too lazy to search 😐
Rebecca Black's Friday is one of those things where autotune couldn't fix her singing  Now don't get me wrong Rebecca Black is an awesome singer her work is amazing and everyone should check her out~ But that song is a good example of not so good singing with autotune tbh I think Friday is amazing, I quote it all the time it, has brought me much joy over the years, and I love it
Using T-pain’s beautiful music to hypnotize us into subscribing to your secret channel... I’m in.
No you see what we’re not gonna do is drag my man T Pain for using auto tune. So many artists do and it’s crap but he’s the master.
T pain can really sing though, and his sound is nostalgic af
i personally dont like a ton of autotune, but i still know that it hasn't ruined music? like d'angelo said its simply and instrument that can be changed and played with. anyways d'angelo is always right :)
With peace nd love......but why are you reporting on this now?
Well said and very well researched...can't blame TPain or other people in general for being good in what they do lol, it just makes you look salty and lesser of a person jmho. thanks for the video and keep creating great content!
y’all wanna hear bad autotune? listen to louis tomlinson’s cover of i gotta feeling…    ps. i love that man with all my heart. that cover is iconic.
D'Angelo says singing like Ethan Klein.. "singging" 🙂
So nobody is going to cancel Cher because she did it 1st
Please let king t pain see this video
t-pain needs to see this video
Oh my God music cant be ruined, is it ruined bc we moved away from flute music from the Dark Ages????? The world advanced and so does technology and people use that to make art. Look at Giorgio Moroder, an Italian composer that directly made electronic dance bc of advancing technology. And if your THAT mad just listen to artists that don’t use auto tune problem solved. Let people make their art, if you don’t like it just leave 🙄🙄
I love an auto tune banger and absolutely Stan t-pain and think he’s a pioneer. It’s only like using an FX peddle on a guitar or a vocoder. He seems like a total babe as well, such a sweet guy. Makes me stan him even more.
D'angelo's influence is so massive. A channel without a single upload and he's already getting his third silver play button. If he wanted to he could take over a country and we'd all just let it happen. With that said, where can I apply to be a citizen of D'angeland?
Usher is still out here releasing songs about cheating 20 years later so ....pffffttevvdv
Fr this is also generalisable people hating on popular artists because they don't like the sound is dumb ...  just listen to other music
PREACH !! I hear ppl diss today's R&B all the time (or even Western R&B from so m e kpop stans that cross the line,,,,,) and I'm like......are we not listening to the same stuff??? Especially cause the women carrying the industry rn are absolutely 🤌 not to mention how R&B is evolving into more of an alternative realm that explores deeper concepts and identities beyond typical party/romance themes !! What's not to love??
Dude stopped making good music
T-Pain tried to do his own thing with AutoTune and everyone else just tried to copy him and steal his style
i cant even sing with auto tune lol
I must be such a boomer. I remember hating Akon for the same reason.
I'm not that familiar with Usher's music. When you played that clip of "questionable music" I laughed so hard.
20:00 If that ain’t nothing but the truth. I already had years of repressed mental illness behind me when my best friend just dropped me after saying a bunch of really hurtful things to me and that was just the last thing I needed to break down. I’m almost kinda thankful I did though - would have never had the guts to get help via a therapist and a psychiatrist otherwise.
The fact that this man had depression for four years and all people care about is that he uses auto tune in his songs like thousands of other artists is just disgusting.
D’Angelo definitely watched Sideway’s video on auto tune
bro i love his songs
good fucking point about finding good music!!!!!!! people who hate the top 50 but don't try to find anything outside of that are the worst.
T-Pain is the autotune was the best comment ever!
When I think of T pain I think of: "She made us drinks To drink We drunk 'em Got drunk" Those were the funniest lyrics I've ever heard
The man is all: 🥺  In a good way
I love autotune if its done right, it gives the songs such a unique vibe
T-Pain didn't invent autotune. He just used it.  Usher is not the arbiter of what music is, and who ruined it. Usher is wrong. Other people using it and ruining it could have got it from other artists who used it long before T-Pain did. If autotune ruined music, it was ruined long before T-Pain started using it. And by the way, T-Pain is an amazing singer.
So basically...he couldn't match up to T-Pains success (still putting out music) that he "ruined" music for him (Usher)?
I don’t listen to r&b much but tpain is a damn legend. I love that man
NGL, kinda sad that your newest video isn't about Creepshow Art and her freakish awful stalking of Emily Artful and Co.
autotune is the coolest thing, it sounds soo cool
Sorry, but if you are butthurt about how (in your opinion) good R&B has been on the decline, you shouldn't blame it on T-Pain if people didn't consume it and spend a fuck off amount of money so they could listening to it, download it and see him perform it live then that sound wouldn't of blown up. It's not the artists fault, once again it's the general public's fault.  Society, man, society.  Also if you want to find "good artists" with a sound you like and you can't find it in Spotifys top songs then get off the mainstream pipeline and go search for live music venues in your area and support smaller artists, the sound you are looking for is out there you just have to find it.
I love that "fangirling" was made to degrade girls for really loving something and our generation of guys are just like "yes we're crazy about this thing guess we're fangirls/boys". Like y'all rock for completely destroying the negative connotations that come along with girls liking something
Hatsune Miku left the Chat.
Personally I don’t care for the super auto tune songs but I definitely don’t blame any one person for this change in style of main steam music it’s just the way the industry has changed over time
Pitch correction and auto-tune are two completely different things, and if one of them "ruined" anything, could only be the former, if only because it's more deceptive.  Also, T Pain has a really nice voice, everyone is mean and ignorant and dumb.  Edit: damn right Cher's Believe still slaps.
Bigger than an album release? Dangelo is going to become president
Anyone who says modern music sucks doesn''t listen to enough music. Trust me, the stuff you like is out there!
Post Malones use of auto tune is my absolute favorite
all of the other stuff aside: D’Angelo, EXPRESSO??
tpain really seems like the sweetest guy, I never really gave him much thought cuz of the music he made but I’ve seen him in interviews and social media posts and he just seems like he wants to make music that makes people happy and dancing!!!
D'Angelo giving a compilation of famous singers and sounding better than all of them is exactly what I expect from this channel
Not me crying from that clip of T-Pain looking upset 😭
And he's back c:
If you dont like it don't care about it It's this easy people let him do what he wants
you're telling me Usher had someone WAKE HIM UP while he was trying to rest on a flight, to say something so rude lmao? imagine having the nerve...
nice hoodie D'angelo:) only real ones know
Nope. It still makes me weirdly angry and I don't know why.
T-Pain's legacy is changing musical direction and Usher's legacy is giving people sexually transmitted diseases!
D’Angelo casually dropping amazing lesser known artists for us to listen to (when we take a break from listening to T-Pain). Also 100% agree with all of this!
Great, thanks alot D'Angelo... now I have Cher stuck in my head
I love listening to you talk about music!!
You say singing the same way Ethan Klein does... That's wholesome
What people don‘t understand is that autotune is a stylistic device. I’m personally not a fan, BUT it’s a choice. Not just some way of correcting bad vocals.
Is he the guy that rhymed mansion with Wisconsin i love him
Also Chloe Bailey amazes me
If only tpain went to dangelo wallace in 2013 for advice on this
Maybe it would be a problem if he couldn't even sing... but have you heard the man without it? Point is, it was a style for him.
D'Angelo telling the truth for 20 minutes again
Sing-ging <3
This is just dumb like 98% of artists on everyone’s playlists aren’t using autotune to some capacity
Can we realize that because one person starting something doesn't mean others have to follow suit?
All the folks I follow on Twitter are defending tf out of TPain and wanting to give him a hug and that's how I know I follow good folk. ❤️
I want to see D'Angelo spotify so bad
We KNOW Usher’s a bitch. Nothing new.
Usher? We really gonna let Cheerios man decide on music taste
Thanks, going to go play the whole of T-Pains discography now!
Once again D'Angelo is caught on the right side of history.
auto-tune or no, new r&b stars will rise and I think Usher felt threatened by that. T-Pain was on his way up and Usher was on his way out. Seems like Usher was salty....
Entire history of innovations in music production-*that ruined music forever* T-Pain on the side of history so every dumbass can suck it  The wrong thing, something meanspirited like ‘you ruined our industry’ from someone at the wrong time-yeah, that can cause a person to spiral. No magic words, just someone being callous and uncaring. Don’t do that.
Autotune is just a fun vocal effect, similar to a harmonizer or a vocoder. Pitch correction is not that. If you wanna hear a bad use of pitch correction, listen to Emma Watson singing in the beauty and the beast remake.
Hey I like tpain auto tune
Music is an art form.  It shouldn't matter what materials or tools you use to create the art, it's the finished piece that is important.    If you look at a painting,  you don't judge it solely by the choice of brushes,  the kind of easel used,  whether the entire thing was painted with their fingers or a palette knife. You look at how the artist combined the materials and how they used the tools to create an effect that observers can find meaning or enjoyment in.  This doesn't change if the painting is worked in oils, watercolour or acrylics. The effect it has on any individual is also entirely subjective - what looks like a masterpiece to me may  lack beauty or meaning to you.   T-Pain's auto-tuned music has an effect on people. He combines his materials and tools to create art that some people enjoy and some don't. To say that he ruined all other music in the R&B category is assigning him a whole lot of power.  Picasso and other artists created abstract art that some people loved and some people didn't think was real art because the finished pieces don't necessarily accurately represent reality and the world as it actually appears.   The existence of Picasso's abstract art, and the influence he had on other artists, did not stop painters creating new works of classic realism that were enjoyed by people as much as they ever were.    The style of art that people want to hang on their walls may come in and out of fashion,  but a new style coming to popularity doesn't erase all of the other styles of art. People's enjoyment of abstract art doesn't mean they can't also still enjoy realism.   T-Pain may have influenced others to create music using auto-tune the way he did, but that didn't keep more traditional R&B from being made. The use of auto-tune and the intentional distortion of the voice is just as creative, skilled and artistic as the use of an acoustic guitar and someone's bare voice.  The tools and materials chosen may differ but they are both works of musical art that can happily coexist alongside one another under the umbrella of R&B.
This video did actually make me happy overall, especially the end part. Look at him hyping up his support. I can never get enough of musicians like T-Pain and they do exist in every genre like you said. Just have to find them
I’m surprised how much you know about music production. When’s the double album coming out?
Daaaaamn 🎶I’m spruuuung 🎶 Brought me back to high school when I had an iPod nano 😆
This song is now stuck inside my head.
Tpain is THE y2k GOAT IDC made a whole new sound tbhh
Usher is not even worthy of staying in a pool of piss T-Pain made
Seriously did you have to do that to me... damn Lego song!
T-Pain is ICONIC PERIODDD haters just wish they had the artistry!!
whats the song/performance called from shamir
Auto tune is like makeup... it can't fix ugly. You have to start with a good base.
"Digitally editing vocals bad" is an evolution of "computer music bad" which in turn is an evolution of "electric guitars bad". Mainstream music is mainstream because a crapton of people like it, and autotune has stuck around because people think it sounds cool.   "More bad RnB music because autotune" is a hilarious example of not seeing the forest because of all of the trees. Autotune is just one of the many ways music production has become more varied, versatile and accessible. Music publishing has also had like, nothing short of a goddamn revolution through the internet and streaming services, social media etc. This has lead to a massive boom in the amount of music published, the variety in music, and accessibility to the average listener. When there's more music in general, there's more bad music in general. Unless T-Pain invented the internet or streaming platforms it seems kind of unreasonable to credit/blame him for any of this.  There's more choice than ever as a listener, and it's kind of funny that people choose to complain about what other people like and listen to in an era of music where it's super easy to choose your own music adventure by handpicking who you want to curate your playlist or just curating one yourself. Even algorithms kinda work this way, maybe this is the problem. People are clicking shit they hate and complaining in the comment section and training their algorithms to put more of that shit in their feeds lol. Maybe a PSA is in order or something, idk.
I LOVED T-pain in the Masked Singer !
Imagine being such a d*ck that you have to go so far out of the way to insult someone that you had them f*cking *summoned* to you.
Big fan, here- another great video! Dangelo, about your ad read: as a barista I feel the need to point out it’s pronounced ES-presso not EX-presso. (Sorry, it’s a pet peeve of mine) Keep up the good work!
What it just comes down to is that people see something being popular and since money makes the world go round (sigh) everyone else wants a piece of that too. But instead of actually going into all the elements that makes a thing good and popular, they take whatever single element stands out the most and apply it to their own stuff. It doesn't matter what the artistic field is, it doesn't matter when or where, this always happens. And it always fails because it's not that single element that makes it good. It's that unique combination of elements that makes that first thing popular to begin with. (with T-Pain, his already good voice, the great songwriting with catchy hooks, the standout sound with the autotune, just to name a few)
People said the same thing about Kanye when he released 808’s and now it’s viewed as one of his best albums
Umm... not d'angelo forgetting the woohoo disstrack???
just because you don't like an aspect of an artists music doesn't mean they've ruined music. just. don't listen to their music if you hate it so much. like?? just listen to somebody else???
I like to think of auto-tune as using an electric violin Vs a regular violin If you don't know how to play it, you can use al the modifications you want, it will still sound like a fork against a plate
That video made me so sad, I don’t really know t pain but he seems so nice, and wholesome.
Omg that’s why dixies but sounds so weird
T-Pain is amazingly talented even without autotune, so as far as I'm concerned he can play around with it in his music as much as he wants, the finished music will be beautiful regardless. Blaming him for "lesser" musicians overusing autotune doesn't make all that much sense, he went with a style that worked for him and that wouldn't work for someone far less talented, so the whole thing is irrelevant.  As for Usher telling him what he did, that is incredibly messed up, even when forgetting about music for a moment and focusing on the general message of it. Even if he genuinely thought that, that is such a horrible thing to just randomly say, especially to your "friend". You don't just walk up to someone and pretty much tell them "hey, your existence is the reason this thing about our society is messed up now"...
d’angelo looks like he used ableton
Usher "ruined music" by discovering Justin Beiber.
Had to listen to T Pain after this
T-PAIN RHYMED MANSION WITH WISCONSIN! SHUT UP USHER!
Idk why people are still talking shit about autotune lol. Literally everyone uses it, unless you have the vocal chords and intonation of a LITERAL GOD, you need autotune. Pitch correction has been a part of the industry since forever. Yes, you can just wing it with autotune and it'll sound okay, but a good singer with a little pitch correction in the right places just elevates a good take to a great take.  Also, nice of you to mention Jacob Collier, he's beyond insane.
seeing as though all the top hit songs are autotuned as are most of the songs in your music library and yall love it.....you're making an issue out of nothing. autotune has been used in music since the late 90s . yall just bored
Usher is jealous. That's it. No other explanation.
"modern music is bad" then don't listen to it?
You have rlly good self awareness, goals tbh
plot twist: hella musicians use auto tune……time to get over it or stop listening to anything that’s not produced in a teenagers basement
That Pokémon gold tho
I wish I could like this twice
Only real fans remember his community post about a SOUR video  Gone but never forgotten
He’s an extremely talented musician. He’s proved he can sing like an absolute legend without auto tune. Charli XcX is inspired to record music with auto tune and other vocal fx, probably because her voice is damaged. 🎶
He might be brainwashing us low key though Brainwashing us to love beautiful music in all shapes and sizes Brainwashing us into Acceptance
Hi D'Angelo I've subscribed to the second secret channel but Imma need you to spread some positivity by telling me where that hoodie is from cause I love it. Please send link lol
Usher is envious af. What an ugly thing to do to your friend
please drop your spotify username thank u
That’s like when my dad and my grandpa were complaining about how no one used real instruments and everything is electronic and like how it’s so easy for anyone to be an artist   Like ummmm  The 80s has synths and *electric* guitars  And sure anyway can make music but not EVERYONE can make good music and like   A lot is not most artists have people to make the tracks for them  They don’t just buy a track or use some royalty free track and get a fucking billboard hot 100 or something   Like wouldn’t you think idk like Mozart would say the same thing about music at that time? *Music is evolving and get more tools it’s not ruined*
Now the world loves tpain and his influence is seen everywhere meanwhile usher’s in the strip club paying with fake money, life comes at you fast🥴
Usher? He's still around?
Usher needs to take his opinion and his fake strip club money far away from us.
I don't believe you can ruin music by making your own style of it. Everyone has a right to create in their own way without facing criticism for doing do. If people are drawn to your art, who is anyone to try and make you feel bad for it? Also great point about people needing to get better at finding music for themselves instead of putting down popular stuff they don't like!!
Can we all go and destroy Twitter's servers?
When and where can I get this hoodie?
i love autotune
If dangelo started a talk show I would definitely watch.
D’angelo should join the Baddie SMP
People were so excited about technology in the 80s
Imagine being so shitty, you go out of your way to bring someone down.
Like honestly… I’m glad these people haven’t discovered hyper pop 😳
Dude I love you....but It's espresso...not eXpresso. Please. Thanks.
I love good autotune. It weirdly makes the artist sound more human to me.
Wait why is D’Angelo boring now
13:49 lmao when he wrote "two random small artists idk" in ariana Grande's and the weekend's clip 😭🖐🏽
I don’t think Usher should talk. He said that T-Pain ruined music with autotune but Usher introduced Justin Bieber. I think T-Pain wins this argument.
JACOB RECOGNITION YESSS
I remember the early 2000s hatred of autotune. How short we fell back then
I was happy with not knowing this shit 🤣😅
Peter Frampton used to talk with his guitar... This kind of vocal play in music is literally a huge part of it’s history.
The more you hear about usher the more you realise what a sh1tty person he is
Katy Perry right now: 👀
D'Angelo goes into detail about celebrity stories the mainstream glosses over and I appreciate that kind of in depth analysis :)
I hate this for him. T-Pain is a legend. He’s also a “real singer.” 🙄 This is the thing…tons of people rode his nuts. Hard. At the beginning, 2005, too many artists copied him and used it as a crutch. T-Pain made a stylistic choice and is incredibly successful and talented. People are salty. Usher is salty.
Got excited cause I thought he was sponsored by zadico tea😂
people care this much about autotune but not about abuser chris brown
Why am I only just now noticing your cheekbones omg
Y’all just missed the Tory Lanez thing then?
"People on twitter-" is such a valid and just perfect sentence.
You know, sometimes people say stupid or mean things unintentionally in the moment, in the middle of a convo. But this dude went out of his way to wake his friend up from a peaceful sleep and start a conversation because he wanted to tell him "you ruined music." What kind of friend does something so cruel and unnecessarily hurtful?
this song's already stuck inside my heeaaaad!
They don’t even make sense. Like it’s the people...US that make an artist famous or a song popular. So by blaming T Pain for ruining music is weird because if you don’t like his music then don’t listen, but because you listen to it you make him more popular therefore giving him more of an influence over the music scene. At the end of the day, an artist can do whatever they want with their music and experiment with their sound. He tried autotune, and his fans ate it up so you can’t blame the guy for anything when you are the same people that still listen to his songs anyways and enhance him to have that influence in the first place.
his tiny desk concert is amazing I have shown it to so many people, that man is magic
My brain the whole time I was watching this: JayWHypeEeEEeEe
People trying to cancel him are proving they know nothing about T! He has a magnificent voice.
The rubbish artists messed up music
Watch Sideways' video about autotune. He gives a great explanation about the difference between AUTOTUNE and PITCH CORRECTION, and why it's dumb to hate on T-Pain just because he uses autotune
Thank you!!! Some one had to say this, most of all ppl are really lazy and can’t find music they enjoy, which baffles me on the streaming pages eras. Music is not ruined, Top40 was never THAT good.
T-Pain is sooooooo underrated! His voice is AMAZING
Im LOSING IT bc i paused this video likw 5 minutes in to play O.M.G. for my dad and then rant about the hypocrisy and then i kept playing only for u to do the same 😭
Literally soo many singer use alot of autotune. Justin beiber (he uses soo much autotune he can kinda sing idk), selena gomez (she can't sing at all just made of autotune 😂), demi Lovato- even tho she can sing REALLY good she uses alot of autotune etc. Usher needs to literally stfu, last time I heard about him was like 10 years ago
when I first heard what Usher said I assumed it was a passing comment played off as a joke, but I find it a little strange that he went out of his way to wake T-Pain up on an airplane just to tell him this. I don't understand lmao sounds super bitter, just because you feel pressured to use auto-tune doesn't mean that is his fault
T-Pain > Usher. And Usher is just salty about that.
Love to see you back speaking on interesting topics :)
This is stupid…god what a world we live in. The last almost 2 years of sufferiing teached us nothing.
What is really mind-blowing to me anyway that everybody keeps talking about political correctness, and kindness and whatnot. But then when confronted with old-fashioned bullying, folks just jump on the bandwagon while neglecting their woke virtue-signaling. That this is even worth a debate just goes to show that all that nonsense is just an act.
HOLD UP   WHAT THE HECK
are you gonna comment on shannon at all
Even when Travis Scott fell in auto tune, it was magical 😔💞
I love T-pain from the beginning and continue to listen to all of his music. If I watch your videos and hear his songs in one day will make my day.
And "I'm Sprung" is still a big tune!!!!
auto-tune didnt ruin music. tpain didnt ruin music. usher didnt ruin music. beiber didnt ruin music. auto-tune has definitely been way overplayed and overused but like you said the world is FULL of an infinite supply of music of all styles and genres from a vast assortment of creative people. if you hear something you do not like, look for something else until you find those jimmy jams that getcha moving and grooving!
God out of all things to cancel…………..ppl are complaining about auto tune?
what about Cher?  she's a legend.
I LOVE THE VIDEO TPAIN DESERVES THE WORLD
who is y’all 😭❓
Please go watch T-Pain’s Tiny Desk Concert. He’s amazing.
Usher is a walking L
its true tho??? his auto tune is screech inducing bro
He is absolutely right that everyone uses pitch correction. Even in live performances.
Looking at this confused because there's autotune in Yeah by Usher. Just because it's subtle it doesn't mean it's not there. So fuck off washed up irrelevant twat that's a poor excuse for a friend. (did it sting when you lost your audience since you were always least talented of all R&B singers so you took it out on your friend to feel better you poor excuse for R&B singer that's actually just pop like your Justin Bieber experiment)
Thank you for being the #VoiceOfReason  , morality, wisdom, conscience, sanity...I could go on and on!! So yeah, thank you!! Xoxoxo
When you said "I haven't released any music" I can't express in words how much I started wanting a D'Angelo Wallace Christmas album
the biggest R&B artists out of the last decade don't use autotune in that form: The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, Daniel Ceasar, Khaled and many more so what I just heard is that usher listend to 4-5 popular song at that time and thought that. With that said no T-Pain did definitely did NOT ruin music!
Man, when I saw your post I assumed Usher said this in an interview. To say that to someone in person, let alone waking them up to tell them and saying it to a friend, is fucking awful.
*I want that hoodie so bad.*
Give credit where credit is due; 808s and Heartbreak came out in 2008!
At this point, i say yes to anything D'Angelo says.
He can sing so well! Ppl think he can't sing
Auto tune has been going on for absolute YEARS. Doesn't anyone remember Blackstreet???? In the 90s, they used to bring that big tube on stage. OMG I wish Usher just left Tpain alone. Sorry but Usher is a stupid bully. Simple. The blacksteet song "Don't leave me"
I think I Stan t-pain now
D'Angelo using correct producer terminology makes his point like 10000 times more valid as he obviously understands the effect. Does this mean he's workin on a mixtape?
tbh, i think t-pain knew that his voice was good, and by all means he knew that in the current climate of music, something unique would be better than his already good voice, so if anything, he was a much bigger innovator than usher. too me he just sounds... kinda salty that he couldn't be as cool as t-pain
T Pain is also a big Gus Johnson fan. Kind of weird to think about someone as big as him watching youtube in his freetime but it seems to be more common than I thought 🤣
*cancelling
Lmao Usher’s opinion will never amount to how many BANGERS T-Pain put out. Usher has good songs too but ok how about stop fucking saying USHA USHA or USHA BABY in your songs- fuck you Usher lol T-Pain’s songs will always be played in clubs and people go wild, Usher plays on the radio and it’s corny.
Okay but D'angelo's hoodie slaps
Go watch his interview on the Gus & Eddy Podccast!!! He is funny, sympathetic, lovely, all in all a wonderful person to get to know, even if just through a one hour podcast! I listened some times to his songs but never really learned about him, he seems like a sensible and clam person, really doesn't deserve this on his soul.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS. Everyone go watch Tpains Tiny Desk Concert.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIjXUg1s5gc&ab_channel=NPRMusic  So many videos posting "LIVE VS AUTOTUNE" videos (about Ashnikko specifically) with those Genius verified Acapella versions against the produced version like they are saying something ahahahahah.  like, yes. there is pitch correction on almost every single produced song that isn't punk, grime, grunge, or lower production value tracks.   Amazing vocalists also need a tiny bit of computerized help for the mix to be as tight as possible for the final product in songs where it's less obvious.   It's a good thing, you might not like the songs you like if pitch correction didn't exist. T-pains hits wouldn't be the same songs without the effects on them.  Its a rad effect. Melodyne is amazing too, I copied multiple versions of a lead vocal and melodyned "fake" harmonies of the vocal track over the chorus and mixed them underneath.  Music production is cool as fuck.  LEAVE TPAIN ALONE HES AMAZING
I'm mostly annoyed that Usher woke up T-Pain for that. Couldn't he have texted? Anyway T-Pain music absolutely slaps.
Can we all give tpain a hug? Cause his songs were awesome and I still listen to them today compared to usher whos been forgotten. He was jealous
So....this is what we doin now?? Cancelling ppl for using autotune???
Have these people never heard of using auto tune as a stylistic choice to enhance the song? ya some people do use it to smooth over their vocals but it’s pretty obvious who uses it as stylistic choice and who uses it to cover up a bit... anyway this hate is so stupid
Would sketchy, wannabe hood bars have even existed in the 2000’s if it weren’t for t-pain?  I think not. He molded me into the human I am 🙌🏼
What was that first set of lyrics..... "Plants really don't deserve me"?? What's that mean?
Okay, after hearing you speak about music,  I REALLY think your secret2022  channel will be about your music. You know too much to be just a music listener. Come on!harmony..) I CAN'T WAIT 🙌🏽 Hope I am not wrong ❤️✨🎶🎶🎶
Liked this video before even watching it
"am I the only one that likes how auto tune sounds?"  Of course not, I mean artists like Dorian Electra have decently massive followings using the auto tuned sound. And I know you're a fan of Dorian like me.  I do get annoyed though with the "they don't need auto tune they can actually sing" people though. Like yeah? so what? they want it, let others be happy.
"I've never released music" okay can I have your mpk261
I'm just confused on the twitter people I never knew sOmEoNe CoUlD sInGlEhAnDeDlY rUiN a WhOlE gEnRe
I'm so here for d'angelo talking music
T-Pain is so sweet 💖
This gives me the same vibe as what people treat 100 gecs with their auto tune
I stan the Giveon shout out 💘
Usher tried to start sumn with the weeknd when the weeknd said he kinda paved the way for dark R&B. He said ushers sound in climax was similar to House of balloons, and this is true because the producer who produced climax said he was inspired by house of balloons. I have no doubt usher said that to T-Pain
Has Usher heard his own music? He might want to look at himself before going after T-Pain
hes an AMAZING singer without autotune. he sings with autotune bc thats a specific style of music... let the man do what he wants.
as someone whose favorite kinda vocal is Vocaloid ive literally never understood people's hatred of autotune like? Its just a stylistic thing and it often elevates a song in a way that more simple vocals couldn't.
I'm just starting the video so idk if you touch on this but the man can like actually sing, the autotune is a style and he does it well you can't be pissed at him for being good at something you hate
I think people mistake nostalgia for quality. Not that throwback R&B isn’t quality, because it definitely is. It just gives us a different feeling to R&B music released now
Anyone know where his hoodie is from?
So his last song he tried to sound like T-pain. Maybe he was genuinely jealous of him?? I’m not some T-pain Stan or really a fan necessarily so I’m not saying “OMg uR juSt JeALouS” but it sounds like he might be…
if we're canceling people over autotune, then 99% of the music industry is canceled too
I respect T-Pain for not correcting fans that “ooo-wee” is actually “and then” for like 10 years and then letting us know we can sing it however we want
Dangelo is again in his ‘I- am-gonna- put- out- the- best- content- for- you- peasants’ bag and I love it ♥️
Lmao usher is a goofy. This mans had STDS and slept with ppl and didn’t even tell them....then he proceeded to throw “usher bucks” on strippers...lol usher is such a goofy
Nah, they sleeping on Masego!!! Sebastian Michael is another one!! Dominic Fike, Daniel Cesar, Syd, Ruti, and Lloyd also! 😫 The music exist, it’s just not appreciated!!
as an artist, people who think autotune is a magic wand that exists to let bad singers make music really remind me of people who think digital art is easier than traditional art lmao. they're just using different tools dude calm down... (also everyone go watch "the problem with auto-tune" by the channel sideways if you want a more in-depth video about it!)
t pain seems so sweet there's no reason to hate on him
YES D! I like you ☺️
Gotta admit, I'm not into Quito time. Ever, but I'm also polite so I'm open to anything.
hehe travis scott falling in autotune
Is the background music D'Angelo uses from .hack//sign? Damn, talk about a hot track from the past.
What's wrong with autotune, though?? I mean, I listen to Vocaloid so I'm used to robotic sounding voices.
u know past me had taste coz she bumped t pain on the daily.
Glad to see another video from you!
You know what ruined music? People that think their opinion on good and bad music matters. It's the type of gatekeeping that I think it's the most toxic in music and should only be reserved for the 10-15 age bracket, when you think listening to metallica makes you cool. I don't like autotune in music, but shit, my boy T-Pain is a cool af guy and my opinion doesn't change his character or make his music universally bad. Music is for whoever likes it and no one in entitled to say some music is bad.
Why was there a random willow smith promo it here 😂 I mean I’m here for it I love her but it was funny how you just slid that in and moved forward 🤣🤣
Just because someone popularized and is shown everyone about that thing and changed an industry, doesn’t mean that it’s always bad to the industry as a whole, it’s just another subset/genre in that one whole industry
I don't have a problem with T Pain's use cos it was a conscious artistic choice. He isn't trying to pretend his voice is something it's not. I don't even like his music. But going after him for what was a creative decision is dumb. I hate autotune if it's to hide bad singing, but no one is using it the way TPain did. He used it in a way that was kinda different for the time.
You know what? This gives me the same vibe as ppl who shame plastic surgery. Like girls with naturally big lips telling girls with filler that they are stealing their look even though it has nothing to do with them.
I had to dislike, it was at 68 dislikes, I had to make it 69, it's not my fault! I HAD TO DO THE FUNNY
didn't they trash 808S and heartbreak by Kanye west because of his use of auto tune during the time
Listen to t pain without auto tune, it will give you chills . It sounds amazing !
T-Pain is and was iconic....Usher just sounds like he was mad he didn't do it first...even back then people were mad that T-Pain was using autotune...see the thing that makes T-Pain stand out is that he doesn't hide behind it...he doesn't lie about using it and is genuinely just a normal fun guy....like he can actually sing and I don't think people know that and just think that auto-tune makes him "sound good"....which doesn't make sense because he can sing...Like don't lie his music and songs still slap today and you know we're still playing them today I know I am...also his new song is 🔥. T-Pain is a legend goodbye
It's a bit messed up that people are making it a negative thing that he did  something that people liked enough to copy. I dont listen to a lot of r&b so im not sure but it sounds like people are complaining about a common situation in the music world. That is somebody does something interesting that gets popular then you get a huge amount of people trying to copy that thing with yes maybe some people getting     noticed that aren't really that talented just because they are doing something that is popular. Like yes its can be annoying but blaming the person that started it is stupid. Like idk i don't think you can blame Eddie van Halen just because everyone with a guitar started trying to sound like him that would be stupid and as is friend its was a pretty messed up thing for usher to do. Like you said it sounds a bit bitter.
Sideways released a great video called “The problem with auto tune” is amazing. It breaks down what exactly auto tune is and how the public perception of it is so fucked up
honestly D'Angelo, we're happy if the content is yours. Regardless of what tis about, you are like a facetune filter for content, it just gets better being presented by you :) Never a source of sorrows
At least with T Pain you can TELL he's using auto tune. Most artists now a days use it discreetly and you don't know until they go live and sound like your drunk aunt on karaoke night...
What about ushers song OMG  Oh oh oh oh oh .... that was full of auto tune?
T-Pain shouldnt be worrying about Usher hes literally two cm close to aids anyways.
if extreme pitch correction and formant shifting didn't exist Dorian Electra and 100 gecs wouldn't sound like Dorian Electra and 100 gecs
His costume on the masked singer was SO precious.  For that alone, we must stan. 😌
Have you ever seen Sideways' video on Pitch correction and auto tune?
It is an effect, like Reverb, Delay, and many other effects. I like to sing without it, but I also like it on some things. T-Pain does not deserve to be disssed. He's extremely talented and then some!
Makes me think about how when I was younger I'd go to my sisters choir and other musical shows and they'd sound awful because everyone was frikin five and I said I hated violins and pianos. I didn't hate the violins and pianos, I hated how they were being used. Don't blame the instrument, blame the user.
Love your vids bro , please could you cover the Billie eilish situation, it’s quite controversial
He sings AMAZING without auto tune
The only thing I took from this was that you, too, are a man of taste and listen to Masego.
damn whoever nickel-wound guitar strings for a brighter timbre was a HACK
1) I love T Pain. I hate to think of that man ever being in that kind of pain, especially by such an insensitive, hypocritical, and just plain rude comment - especially from someone who was his friend. He's such a beautiful singer. And he always seems like such a nice person.  2) I'm glad you focus on making content that makes you happy instead of just cutting a niche "I am the upsetting drama issue news channel". I like watching those videos, too, but it can be overwhelming and depressing seeing them all the time, so I can imagine what it's like being someone who makes them (and them alone) all the time. You make me happy. You're a funny, kind person. And I'd hate to see you swirling in constant negativity. I'll watch anything you come out with, but it makes me happy knowing it's stuff that makes you happy to make and talk about.
honestly wish t pain did more music without autotune
Usher did a song 'OMG' with Will I Am and he was heavily auto-tuned as always . Not sure why he didn't keep that same energy with Will...T- pain never featured with Usher so he was probably salty
Auto-tune was invented a year before the Cher song, but that song was the first to use it to distort the voice of the singer. You can't even hear if a song uses Auto-tune, if it is used "correctly". This use of Auto-tune alone is amazing for singers, because they don't need to take a million takes of a song until they get a version where they hit all notes perfectly. It just makes life a little easier like the "smooth lines" option in digital art. Using it like T Pain and Cher is just another audio tool. Like D'Angelo said before it there already was the vocoder that was invented in 1928 and found it's use in music in the 70ies (Mr. Blue Sky by ELO or Autobahn by Kraftwerk are two I can think of) Personaly I also don't like Auto-tune as a way to distort the voice, but people need to understand that their personal taste doesn't mean something is bad.
See for me autotune is like adding a warm filter to a photo to get a vintage looks. Or a guitarist using a pedal to create a different sound and vibe. The guitarist is still putting in the work and is still playing live but there are just certain distorted sounds and feelings you cant hit with a regular guitar and sometimes you need to hit a pedal to get that. Does it make the guitarist less skilled? Does it make them playing live all of a sudden fake? No.
D’Angelo lookin fine in that sweater. Wait… is the merch!?!
yall T Pain won masked singer without autotune… so he can sing just likes to have fun with his music
I'm so glad Cher was brought up, it's one of my favourite fun facts. And yes, that song is still a banger
T-pain has a beautiful voice outside of auto tune. T-pain is an innovator and usher is not! R&B is just not as popping and is clearly not the top genre it once was. That’s why r&b musicians are not as famous as rappers. Usher can’t sell the records he used to and he projected it unto Tpain.
lmfao "two small artists idk"
Once again, D’Angelo being the voice of reason. T-Pain seems like such a nice dude, this is sad. And after the internet had a big talk about how people and the media need to stop talking about celebrities like garbage. The man said this event sent him to spiral into depression and Twitter is like: “let’s plunge you back there”.
Imagine blaming one person for a population of artist making bad auto tune.
Freeeeeeeeze like me uhhhaaaah
IMAGINE THEY ARE USING AUTOTUNE AND THEY HATE HIM FOR USING AUTOTUNE-
Usher sounds like a 12 year old trying to convince you that girls ruined video games 😭
Bro look at Travis scott😭
I really automatically smirked when I heard T-Pain's voice. Happened way too naturally, I dunno why so I guess his music is God tier.
Great video, broken down perfectly. How anyone can disagree with your argument presented is beyond me. But still…. I blame Cher! ;P    Only joking.
This was a great video. Thank you for mentioning Cher. So people (wrongfully) coming at T-Pain and I was thinking ‘Clearly they have forgotten the late 90s exist…’
The whole entire time I was thinking about OMG.
Travis Scoot Uses Live/Studio Autotune: "KING OF AUTOTUNE" T-Pain uses Autotune- The Artist That Popularised It: "YOU RUINED THE MUSIC INDUSTRY" Stop picking and choosing!
Your sweater, I love it and I need one, I mean I don’t need one but it relates to my life in a wild way.
TPain slaps and no one can tell me otherwise
I have a friend who makes R&B, he is INCREDIBLY talented. The man can do vocal runs like nobody's business. His natural voice is amazing and he, just like T Pain, uses autotune in his music. It makes the songs way more modern and impactful. Auto tune is a tool that can easily sound amazing
I've personally never been a fan of heavy auto tune, but its a personal opinion. T pain didn't ruin music, he just has a unique style that a lot of people enjoyed. As an artist I'd be heartbroken if someone told me I ruined art, so I cant imagine how hard that would of been for him
So.... Daft Punk is cool?
I think we shouldn't say usher HAS this opinion because he voiced this so many years ago. Like D'Angelo pointed out he even started using it himself a lot. So I think we shouldn't assume/imply he still holds this opinion
If it sounds good, it sounds good. Plus his auto-tuned voice literally sounds like his normal voice… he just enjoys the auto-tune. Let him do what he wants. It’s literally not problematic in the least bit 😪
Usher just needs to be canceled and that’s on period!
Was that a Willow Smith ad in there?
Sideways had a really interesting video about autotune and what happened with it since the 90s. T-Pain using autotune is meant to emulate vocoders/voice boxes (?) of the early r&b scene. His voice was never meant to sound realistic, it’s an artistic effect.
Using autotune is like any other instrument. If you don’t know how to use it, it’s gonna sound like shit.
This video is 23 minutes and 7 seconds of pure facts.
Anybody remember his app, I Am T-Pain?
The day people realize autotune doesn’t make a dramatic difference in singing ability is the day we know peace. It’s either pitch correcting or a stylistic choice where you hear it on PURPOSE. if you can’t sing, it won’t give you the ability to. Sideways has a great video about this called “the problem with autotune”
Tallahassee pain  !!
Honestly autotune sounds incredibly cool when used well. It serves a purpose outside of ‘correction’ and people just completely ignore that and claim it just proves an artist sucks. It seriously makes them sound like grumpy ass boomers complaining about ‘quality’ decline and every reason they claim this is completely ignorant and ridiculous. Usher needs to stop yelling at kids to get off his lawn, lmao.
I grew up when T-pain was at his height. I've got a soft spot for him. But even without that, he can sing without autotune, and his use of it is masterful. Truly. That's his sound and it's well done.
If T-Pain could be the new Prince Charming,  I’d get back into Disney 😂😍
The thing is too like tpain even said he got stuck with autotune cause no one would allow him to just sing or rap normally
IS THAT MERCH I SEE??
If you can hear autotune on a song, either.. 1. The artist wants you to hear it, aka it's a stylistic choice (T-pain, Cher, etc) 2. The don't want you to hear it but either the singer is wildly inconsistent and melding together their different takes took a lot more tuning or the engineer isn't that good at their job.  99.999% of the time, if you can hear it, that's a choice. Most, if not all big engineers and singers use some form of tuning, you just don't know/hear it.
Bitches need to calm down. Besides, Cher used autotune in 1998 and started a trend that lasted for years. Just stop.
Love the video and agree with everything you pointed out, but just to clarify, 10:57 is a clip of a talkbox. There's no pitch correction involved.  In fact, he's not even singing at all. The way a talkbox works is that tube carries the sound from the synthesizer into his mouth. Then he shapes the sound into vowels, basically turning the synth into his voice. Around this time there were also Vocoders, which achieved similar effects through different methods. Really fascinating techhnology you should look into.
Honestly though, 5 O'Clock is still a banger all these years later
I think probably I also thought autotune  was dumb in 2013, but listening to people like D'Angelo explaining why T-Pain is amazing and watching music documentaries showed me I was the dumb one. I agree T-Pain is a Disney prince (he sounds like such an adorable dude) and I think there needs to be a movie
Totally vibe with the "someone you thought wouldn't put you through it putting you through it" and it hurts so much. I have a lot of trust issues I'm tryna get over because of how often it happens
what song of fka twiggs is that?
apparently every gen needs to cancel T pain for this 🤷🏻smh
Sideways has a very good video on Autotune and how people misunderstand it. If you haven’t watched it, I recommend it. This is just a plug for a creator that I think is great and you should check out. He also has a lot of videos on music in general. Just check him out!
Didnt usher put out autotuned songs as well? Hypocrite
which fka twigs song was that?
I work at a music venue and of all the performances I’ve seen, T-Pain was my favorite. I’ve seen Snoop, Kendrick, Future, Tyler, ASAP Rocky, Logic, Earl, and 200 more. T-Pain is the only artist that played a consecutive 2 hour set with no breaks. He was also on time. HE CAN sing without auto tune as well. I didn’t expect T-Pain to be my favorite performance….I also didn’t realize how MANY songs of his were on the radio. Since that performance, It’s clear to me that he’s a real artist who works hard.
T-Pain can sing, also it takes talent to write songs as well. Yes the whole creation process is detailed.  That’s so hurtful that Usher said that.😢. Yes “ computer love” came out  way before usher was on stage. “Perfect Pitch “ .The voice is an instrument! 👏🏽. And ppl slap the bass and make it sound cool. I think it’s only fair to appreciate auto tone. T-pain is a cool vibe. 🤗.  I appreciate you!!
if anyone hasnt seen sideways' video on autotune its a rather good partner video to add to this one
T-Pain's cover of "Stay With Me" on The Masked Singer made me fucking cry
Buy U A Drank is literally a masterpiece
As a vocalist I love you 😘
That ring :0
Omg T-Pain was my early 20’s at the bar scene. I love him. I feel so bad he had a depression when he got so many of us dancing and partying! I hope he watches this video. Poor T-Pain.
Yess, my king for the Giveon shout out!
Lost my virginity at 9 to a t- pain song
I feel like Cher is gonna be pissed off people are attributing "ruining music with auto tune" to T-Pain now when that used to be her jam. Do you believe in life after love? ETA TPain is the best :( why people gotta be so mean.
i agree with every single thing you said but that being said…where the fuck can i get that sweatshirt 😍
D Angelo has no right being this fine
Not me a metal head rolling up my sleeves ready to come for usher for making Tpain feel that way
"Y'all need to try harder to find music you like" FAAAAAAAAAAAACTS. If you're not into the top 40 then stop listening to the top 40. Stop being fucking surprised when you don't like the top 40 lmao. You're allowed to like things others aren't in to and yeah it takes more effort but it's fucking worth it.
I think the issue is that Usher thinks T Pain ruined r&b/hip hop... and helped water it down and eventually killing it in the 2000s. Usher is from the 90s/Early 2000s generation of "hip hop/soul" when actual singing was essential to being a successful urban artist. T Pain changed that and lowered the bar. Thats why r&b today is dead, and what we have left is no longer soulful.   That said, this was an industry wide evolution, and singling out one man as the fault the way Usher did was wrong. But he wasn't the first . Wasn't Jay Z's diss track attacking T Pain's style what killed his career?
Who wakes someone up to tell them that they fucked up music for the entire world? When first of all that’s not even true, he literally just expanded music, just cause marketing execs might take it too far, that’s not T-Pain’s fault, that’s capitalism and other human’s greed. And Usher’s really gonna talk about fucking up the music industry when he put on Justin Bieber, now I’m not saying Justin Bieber isn’t talented or creative because he is, but is he more so than every little Black boy or every girl around his age at the time or did he just get chosen by Usher and the algorithms of YouTube? I’m just saying Usher chose to make a white boy/man super successful in the music industry (and almost kind of okayed moderate cultural appropriation idk that’s debatable) and then he’s gonna wake up someone else and say they ruined the music industry or whatever, worry about your own Confessions Usher, Yeah?
D'Angelo's hoodie reminded me of his old outro in his other channel (?) lol
if you watch Roomie's videos, you'll know that people even do "live" auto-tune these days. Even in singing competitions and live shows. There's literally no singer how doesn't and hasn't use autotune/melodyne in their songs. T-pain doesn't deserve this slander :(
I recommend watching Sideway’s “the problem with auto tune” after this
The quality of music and the talent of a singer should be separated. There are some horrible singers that have used autotune to create amazing pieces of art. Even many perfect singers use autotune as a way to give themselves a different sound and improve their songs. The talent to make a good song and the talent to sing can be completely different and that should be accepted at this point.  Shame on Usher for being so shitty to another artist, That was uncalled for and overall in my opinion just a bad take on music.
Stevie wonder was using that style in the 70s usher just has toxic traits
He said what he said and we all stand behind it. 🙌🏽🙌🏽
i greatly recommend to everyone (and you d'angelo!!) to watch sideways' (youtube biggest music nerd and my personal ✨fave✨) video about autotune!! it's an even deeper dive on what it is and it's very entertaining!!! (ps t-pain slaps!!!!!)
He's good both with and without autotune
Usher should have just sat there and let T-Pain sleep! Bitter people gonna be bitter, I suppose…
Thankfully D’angelo to the rescue with the facts no one could have put out a better analogy on this situation 💯
We love a good NRP tiny desk.
I don't get the people who think autotune is the coming of the anti-Christ. They even use it on Opera. Fifth Element? Diva Dance? Anybody?
Since when was he canceled.... y’all really cancel everyone y’all need to put respect on his name 🙄.
This was a great break down! Thank you
Where can I find D’Angelo’s hoodie? It’s straight fire
Omg thank you so much for this!! I have been saying this for years!!!.. yes he used auto tune but he can already sing..like sang!!  thats why it sounded so good!
like bruh i usually don’t hear bands in person so i’d rather them sound better on tape or whatever
Acting like their favorite artist doesn’t use auto tune 😐 at least he can make It sound good and sound good without it
People don’t understand Autotune vs standard pitch correction and therefore assume that only “bad singers” use Autotune when they really mean pitch correction, Sideways has an excellent video on how the music industry perfects vocal performances, it’s very enlightening.
Charlie Puth and Kenny Beats once talked about how important autotune and pitch correction is - it literally just makes everyones vocals that much better. And as someone who sings and produces music - pitch correction helps SO much and really makes it sound so much more cohesive!
T-Pain and R&B in general may not be my style, but I still respect the guy for how he found a tool, then got creative with how he could use it. It's not like it sounds bad either??
It was after Ushers first follow up to Confessions didn't do so well so he pivoted to that techno/autotune sound. He probably felt bitter that he had to make that jump and blamed T-Pain for his waning success.
Just watched the part with the interview, sad as fuq someone give him a hug
Who the the hell can dislike such an awesome guy. His twitch intro freakin slaps and hes just amazing all around. Mad respect for him!
T Pain used autotune artistically, unlike those who use it for pitch corrections. Unlike rappers who use it awfully.
RIP I actually wanted those coffee bars but their website wasn't working. Oh yeah, T-Pain.
Ahh… nostalgia right here. Have always loved T-Pain. Not based in the US had no idea he was on the Masked Singer and went to watch his performance 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Man people just mad cuz he sounds gwood with or without auto toon
I play a lot in audio engineering studios and I never had the pleasure to work with  pitch modification, but I can say firsthand that everything that goes into any song is incredibly difficult. You write a song (generally just one instrument and a voice with words), you refine it, you find people to play on it, you create all of the other parts, you record it (which the recording process can alone take hours) and then you finally take that recording and prey it’s perfect, you mix each individual instrument so everything fits perfectly in its puzzle, you add the compression and the EQ, delay/pitch mod/reverb/distortion whatever you want. Basically... if you managed to put a song together and recorded you have talent
Tpain is so so SOOO talented. I got way too excited the first time I heard him on masked singer yelling at anyone who would listen, THATS TPAIN BRUH! and nobody believed me, bc everyone was like "tpain isn't a good singer" or "haha if that's tpain where's the autotune" and it made me SO mad. So I was pumped when he won so I could shove it in my friends face that he was a great singer and they shouldnt have discounted him just bc of the autotune. I wish more people would listen to his voice without autotune so they can see he's a freaking talented dude. He didn't use autotune to hide being talentless, he used autotune to stand out when he was putting out music, and he DID. He made great songs that were catchy and just bangers. I'm sorry but he is awesome, and it wasn't popular at the time to use autotune the way he did. It made him different and unique. But he has the singing voice, the writing capabilities, the presence. He's TALENTED AF my guy.
It's the Golden Age Fallacy. Anytime people say stuff like this about music, I like to remind them that Sinatra despised Elvis Presley and rock music. Music tastes change. It's normal. And it doesn't automatically mean the older way of doing things is better.  Source: https://americansongwriter.com/frank-sinatra-called-out-elvis-presley-in-an-article/
When he mentioned Willow Smith's upcoming album I got chills
Honestly these people don't deserve T-pain. I'm revoking they T-pain privileges and yes that includes any auto-tune features music
I really feel like people who complain about mainstream media, especially music, just need to get better at finding indie stuff that they like. It honestly sounds like they're only consuming media that they're told to when they could be supporting indie content or smaller companies. This isn't be being like "I'm cool for only listening to indie music," this is me saying "if you don't like the mainstream, stay away from the mainstream." If you stop watching mainstream content you don't like, it will stop being profitable. This is why hate watching makes no sense to me.
Why did usher decide to be an asshole that day?
usher’s biggest achievement was the parody of Revenge, who cares about him anyway 😤
let’s not forget the fact that when D’Angelo raided T-Pain on twitch the first thing he did was introduce his kids😭 he’s too wholesome and doesn’t deserve this hate
A friend of mine has been streaming for a few years and T-Pain found him and has been heavily supporting him since. He’s such an incredible dude with a massive heart
Do people not realize T Pain's use of auto tune is a stylistic choice? They really think he does that cuz he can't sing??
but that autotune sound is so iconic!!!
Clearly all of you have forgotten that T-Pain wasn’t the only one that used heavy auto tune in his music... Cher did it first back in 1998 with Believe!
Your skin is glowing, when do we get a "my morning routine video" from you 😁 I'd watch it ✋ (sorry for the out of context message) 😅
This is really sad. T-Pain is a cool dude. Just so nice in any interview I’ve seen. Usher is entitled to his opinion but him calling him out was the definition of bad manners. Just plain rude. You don’t tell a person their outfit is ugly because it’s just rude. But to dis his talent, Usher of all people, blah. His music got old fast snd is just crap in general as far as I’m concerned. He was purely a fad. T-Pain has jams that still hold up to this day from way back. Usher? His music is eh. Not horrible, but major eh.
I can understand Usher’s point of view but it’s unfair. T-Pain’s sound totally has a place in music.  But I’m pretty upset about the shitty live show I saw him in one time, dude didn’t even bother to lip sync,  he just stood there being his own hype man and telling the audience to sing. Laziest concert ever. If it wasn’t a festival I’d want my money back.
Usher can’t talk… the dude still supports Chris Brown 🙄
I don't like a large amount of auto tune personally, but T-Pain is a great dude as far as I'm aware. He doesn't deserve to be treated that way, he makes music and obviously people like it so I just don't get why people act that way.
This D'Angelo background track.... So subtle... I love it!
Like….usher wtf!! Poor T Pain,he looked so much in…pain?!!! Also, *_Masegoooo! Impeccable taste D!!_* 🖤🖤🖤
Literally, people getting pressed over people using auto tune, which has existed for so long. It’s not like T-pain invented auto tune. And honestly, people can use it as an artistic choice, or because their singing sucks. USUALLY, auto tune is used for the first option.
Kinda funny I don’t even listen to music, except when I’m studying but I listen to like elevator music or songs I don’t even know the name of.
I am going to a sleep away camp for a week and I can’t bring electronics so I can’t wait to binge your new vids when I come home
I mean, I'm with T-Pain ever since he played a tournament of rainbow six siege with Badger
Yes when someone you trust...... says something. The most hurtful things you can possibly say to someone. Yes. It DOES hit different. Because you never expected it or saw it coming. Those are the worst betrayels of life
TPain is a national treasure and deserves so much better
the nerve to get someone to wake someone else up on the plane- let alone to say some rude fn shit to them..what kind of friend is that😬
I was skeptical about autotune until bon iver got his hands on it. thats when i saw fuckin heaven
Honestly it doesn’t make sense that people are saying dad oh the reason why music is around is because T-Pain used auto tune but I’m so confused because it’s not like he was the first person to use auditing like literally half of all the singers use auto tune so I don’t know why it such a big deal when T-Pain used it and now oh he ruined music it just doesn’t make sense oh and also it was just plain out rude for Asher to say that to him like that’s just so bad and so messed up I mean to be honest there’s only one way to Waze it autotune can be bad only one you overuse it in a way that the music starts to sound bad and unoriginal and not iconic at all so that’s pretty much the only way the autotune can be bad and also when your voice is actually really bad in real life and you’re just using auto tune  to cover that up
T-pain could never ruin music because there is always different types of music even if it is in a single genre…there is multiple different sounds. So honestly in him doing auto tune makes no difference. Would have people hopped on his wave and (people have that have questioned him)…would they have compared to him probably not. T-pain CAN MF SAAAANNGGG…and sound the same without auto tune. I just think they were hating because T-pain was POPULAR AND was popping.
Disappointed that there are no captions available for the video
I love how you brought up Roger! You also had many other great points, like OMG with will.i.am. I once watched an interview or it was some type of special where usher was bitching about how he didn't like American idol and those types of shows because he had to work to get where he was and he didn't feel like instant fame was fair. How does he know how hard these people have worked?! Ever since then I've been viewing him differently. I'm still a fan of usher, as I am tpain, but they are both equals and will be remembered in music long after they're gone.
Sideways has a whole video where he talks about how the pitch correction people should be worried about is the stuff they don't immediately notice and it's pretty cool. T-Pain gets so much shit and he's a really talented musician.
any one who shits on auto tune needs to admit they have vibed to some travis scott psych trap
Anyone “cancelling” T-Pain is obviously under 18 years old….
Usher is just salty and his supporters are uncultured swine 😑 and D'Angelo is the most wholesome cult leader ❤
13:00
I never understood the extreme vitriol people had/have towards autotune. It's a tool, and there's nothing wrong with using it stylistically, it can actually add a lot to a recording (think 808's and Heartbreak)
12:27
Unrelated but HOW are you so pretty
D'Angelo: "am I the only one who actually likes the auto tune sound?" Ah, spoken like a true fellow Vocaloid Appreciator <3
Same thing happened in the 80s when electronic instruments started becoming popular.
the same argument happened when Photography was invented. people said photography would ruin painting (in the middle 18oos!). later photographers said that digital photography would ruin analog photography. then painters said that digital painting would ruin painting. etc etc. ad nauseum. Sounds like Usher was in a bad mood that day and throwing some serious Shade.
I'm 41 and auto tune was popular before then. I give you Roger Troutman of Roger and Zapp. Classics such as Computer Love and I Wanna Be Your Man came from auto tuned mastery. We still appreciated that as R&B. Then in that same era we have Al B Sure who clearly didn't have vocal prowess, but we rocked to it. I  think it's the music industry that pushes who they want to push. I agree with your points of finding good music  *Edit I clearly should have watched until the end instead if typing while watching lol, but thanks for bringing up Roger and Zapp. Just goes to show your research skills are top notch👍🏾
mansion in wiscansin
the title alone is causing me to reflect inwardly
“soul train” is the example of an artist who can’t  sing, use autotune, but did it worse.
The problem with auto tune by sideways and this vid need to be listen to by everyone. Talk truths!
OMG THANK YOU. YES. TO EVERYTHING
IT'S NOT REAL D!!! IT NOT REEEEEEEEEL
Ppl really out here mad at t pain (an amazing singer and writer) for using auto tune while some of the biggest artists out there rn don’t even write there own beats and have 3/4s of the vocals written for them… cardi👀 plus arguably ushers only big hit that everyone knows is yeah and it’s only cause of the synth melody smh
That lego song got me
He was on NPR today
They cancel T-Pain for this cause it's more popular to shit on him. It's much easier to get internet points that way. They don't care about autotune when it's their favorite artist
Nobody cancels T-Pain in this house
You used a Kurt Hugo Schneider clip and I could not love you more ^^
T pain is the king of auto tune y’all better put some respect on his name
tpain raised me, will not accept any slander
Music is art and it should be expressed in different ways! I think back at Ariana who sings beautifully by herself but also sounded so cool with mimu gloves back in 2015. It just depends on personal taste at the end of the day  edit: might be 2014 idk lol
Thanks. I found some good musicians from this video
This is actually a beautiful, respectful nod to a talented artist who went through a difficult mental health time and I am crying because YES, love this. 💘
PLEASE I BEG OF YOU PLEASE DO COMMENTARY OVER CHRISTIAN WALKER. HE IS LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF A WALKING PARADOX
someone needs to send this to T Pain. a confidence boost is in order
This is exactly like when the folk rockers got mad at Bob Dylan for adding drums and electric guitar to folk music (which is now called folk rock) in the 60s lol.
Music is art, and like any art everyone has their own style, their own preferences etc. Some invent new techniques and other adapt old ones to fit them. Saying that T-Pain ruined music or RNB as a whole bc he happened to popularize a tool at his and many others disposal is cruel and unfair. Auto-tune doesn’t magically make someone a good singer, it’s not meant for that, it’s about the style and sound it creates, like any other tool in music. Getting pressed because people like it is useless. Everything evolves and changes, and yeah there was definitely a phase where practically everyone and their mom used auto-tune, but that didn’t mean the music was good. Like D’Angelo said, who have you been listening too? There’s new voices and amazing voices hidden everywhere, you just have to look.
D'angelo can i just say u have impeccable music taste
So you're telling me Canyon County comes out January 31st, 2022? She's an Aquarius?? This bitch about to be crazy(good).
T-Pain didn't ruin music switching from Vinyl did. There is nothing like the perfect imperfections of Vinyl. You only get 1 take. And I love it. It's amazing and beautiful. That's all.
Sideways has a really good video on Autotune that explains that autotune itself isn't the problem it's just the way people use it
I like to comment in the fact that tpain uses his auto tuned voice to make a melody, a part of the song. If that makes sense.
I'd like to see Usher tell CHER that SHE ruined music... hahahah... Let's see that, Usher.
T-pain seems like a genuinely nice guy who is using a TOOL that’s available to ALL musicians. It’s like saying “oh if you play the violin you should NEVER use a mute bc you’re cheating” or “if you play the piano you have to tune it yourself” or even “if you sing, you should ONLY sing a cappella”. Or it’s like saying “if you draw, you should never use a ruler”. It’s stupid. Why are you NOT using all the tools available to you as an artist????
Saying autotune is ruining music is like saying the Internet is ruining video's
I know T-Pain. I don't know who's Usher. Says a lot 🤷🏽‍♀️
Where did you get your great sweatshirt?
While I'm a big fan of Ushers music, I have to say that he never struck me as a kind and genuine person. The scene on the plane sounds totally like him and I am saddened that T-Pain went on suffering like that just because someone (whose own relevance was declining) had to lash out so viciously. T-Pain brought something new to the table and that's absolutely legitimate. What everybody else chose to do with their art is not his responsibility.
Do we come at guitarists for using effects pedals? No, so why is autotune different? The way folks like T Pain use it, it's exactly the same as making your guitar go wahwahwah and that is FACTS.  EDIT: Whoops D'Angelo said almost the same thing, that's what I get for commenting mid-video 😓
sneako ratio
T pain did a concert at my bffs and my college we will NOT stand for any tpain slander 😤
please never show usher any hyperpop music
Autotune gives a specific sound, no one gets tricked into thinking someone is Adele by using autotune. Every new thing is blamed for ruining music
This is the dumbest cancelling of all time...
Usher’s voice sounds more generic than autotune
Long story short yes, way too much people use auto tune nowadays but Usher sucks as a friend
it blows my mind that people think there is no good rap or r&b out right now bc I’ve been finding straight fire for years
your plan for thr other channel is just to get a bunch of subs and therefore all of the plaques, right?
Lmao, EVERYONE uses auto tune/pitch correct. All the faves. Even Ariana Grande. It's a stylistic choice for T-Pain, WHO CAN ACTUALLY SING ANYWAY soooo
How are you so dang wise? It's almost scary. I love your videos :D
I swear people need to not go after people for super minor stuff like this. This is so dumb to "cancel" someone(or anyone) over.
Usher was making amazing music at 15. Your bias is so strong and bad, you clearly are so excited about him thanking you.
youtube saw "t" and "pain" and *exclusively* gave me tylenol ads
People blaming T-Pain for the music of today would also have to blame Kanye West’s “808 and Heartbreaks” because it had a similar if not more influence in music of today — and to think that’s a bad thing is just Ludacris
I love T-Pain
I've always loved T-Pain, he's a legit guy. Usher is a little shitstain and I will not take questions on this <3
this video is correct in every way down to the transparent soul plug. also a good metaphor for instrument manipulation going off the guitar example would be the use of pedals. they change/manipulate/distort etc the sound of the guitar and create all sorts of influential and recognizable sounds we all love. in no way do they take away from the authenticity of the instrument or a musician's ability to play it.
T-pain used a new technology in an interesting and new way and got popular doing it. He wasn’t using it as pitch correction, he used it as an effect. Any synth player would get what is going on here, but the average non-musician hears a digital effect and hears “cheating”. This is not the reality of the situation at all.
Usher was a complete jerk. Waking someone to insult them in such a big way. Not a friend.   And he was wrong for all the reason stated in the vid. But still... such a jerk.
I got a genuine butt tonne of joy out of watching this video
D'angelo... you're so young. 1987 wasn't the dark ages.
Some of the most iconic songs have auto tune and people need to live with that
Me who listens to vocaloid: Is this some sort of "real singer" joke I'm too robotic to understand?
fr, people needs to stop acting like shit songs are modern invention
I wanna be your man - Zapp & Roger   THANK YOU for this obscure reference reminder!!!
D'Angelo, here with the truth again
The music discourse isn't the point. T-pain got his heart bruised by someone he cared and admired, and there are people who agree with that. The discourse should be how many hugs he deserves.
d’angelo randomly doing a willow smith advertisement in the middle of the video is my aesthetic.
I think sideways video “the problem with auto tune” can contribute a lot to this “argument “ I think T Pain is a lovely human being that doesn’t deserve hate over his use of auto tune.
10:15 Oh, so the bad stuff.
T-Pain is just one man. Consumers, music execs and producers have a lot more say in how media gets popular rather than individual creators, regardless of their talent. It's like how everyone gave Rebecca Black hell when it was Arc Music Factory behind the entire thing.
T Pain must be protected
So is Tpain an abuser apologist and/or an abuser himself? Cause that's the info I've been getting from black twitter
I see Autotune as a music instrument, not a crutch. That means some artists can use it perfectly, others not so much, just like anything
Usher came before T-Pain, dude. He was around since the early 90s and into the 00s. T-Pain came out in the mid-00s.
this is so boring...
I don't get it. Using auto tune is part of T-Pain's style. To each his own. Some people like it, some don't. To say he 'ruined' RnB is too much and uncalled for, specially coming from a 'friend'.
I hate this t-pain slander!! The man changed music! He's an icon!  I watched the whole this is pop episode and t-pain said that he used auto-tune to stand out and it worked! He's so smart for doing that and changed music bc of it.   I really like the this is pop series and i highly recommend watching the whole show! especially the episode on boyz ii men
"T-Pain good Bieber bad"
Sideways has an amazing video called "The Problem with Autotune" that goes into more detail about melodyne and autotune and how it affects the music industry. 100% recommend watching it if you wanna learn more about it.
dangelo really blessed me by saying *poggers* my skin is now almost as clear as his
people are just desperate to find something to get mad at celebrities for
They better leave T-Pain alone 😤😤😤 Auto tune, no auto tune, the man is talented.
People that can’t sing sound HORRIBLE with auto-tune. Just FYI for those who think otherwise.
Just look up T-Pain and Kenny Beats and tell me he ruined R&B if you dare 🙄🙄🙄
I saw D'Angelo sing for the first time on the H3 podcast and HOLY SHIT I WANT MORE
"I've never released music" D'Angelo you release your sweet voice multiple times a week.
where can I get that hoodie?! It looks awesome!
D’Angelo stans 100 gecs
this was some adam neely shit and you just brought it out there
Yessss, Cher 👏 Do you believe 👏 still 👏 slaps 👏  Omg I'm so old
I love T-Pain
I love tpain
Usher just has to be in a scandal because we all forgot who he was. I love his music but the man has major douchebag vibes.
LMAOOOOOOOOO my head hurts. What a tumor of an app.
I love t-pain. He is good.
There's only SO much auto-tune can do to make your music sound good. The rest of it, like the tracks, background, chorus and the vocals, it's still all on the artist. It takes a lot of talent to sculpt the vocals in such a way that it makes the song catchy. Using auto-tune doesn't make you less talented, cos at the end of the day, it's still YOUR effort that's presented. So.... Yeah
no ads? copyright?
Anyone who thinks autotune is inherently bad need to see Sideways's video on the subject. Not only does he defend T Pain, but he goes into a ton of detail about why it's not inherently bad, and why it's a lot more pervasive than most people think.
I love tpain so much and i always felt like he was an underrated artist and seeing him on tiktok and twitch and on the cave just makes me happy. I love his personality and his music and usher just hurt MY damn feelings. Im about to go punch him for shit he said 6-7 years ago brb
I love t pain and i love d’angelo! You’re energy was so calming and you seemed happy to me. Great video!
Fuck usher!
No, we're not  His salty peers are
🙄 ... but when  you're they're friend though - it's legit projecting. He was definately an asshole to do that to someone, during a nap of all times?!?!?
Love me some Stangelo Wallace
T-Pain is the true Disney Prince.
Ah yes. Tallahassee Pain. My man.
I don't get this. They cancel him for using autotune, but I saw Olivia Rodrigo being bashed during her live performance which was... live and didnt have auto tune because it didnt sound like the studio version which was auto tuned. People aren't canceling him for auto tuning, they're canceling him because they're rude disgusting people who need a source of power.
Auto tune is an artistic choice wgats wrong with people
I wouldnt listen to this type of music but he seems like a great guy and tellling someone they "ruined music" is mean and i hope usher loses his dominent hands thumb
I have an absurd level of love for T Pain and I’m only a minute into the video and I’m already sad - y’all leave T Pain alone he didn’t do anything wrong.
In finishing this video, auto tune was out in the early 90's. Menace to Society (the hardest, most "gangsta" movie possibly in existance) came out in the early 90's and was playing a track in the movie WITH autotune, idk the song but it was clearly popular at that time. So idk what people are even talking about. Autotune been out WAY before T Pain   Oh "Computer Love" that's what it was called, I only know because the title of the song was playing in the chorus lol
whats that fka twigs song
and no, not everything is auto-tuned smh your logic is wrong, you're assuming all who use autotune can already sing. Who has the talent these days and who is the actual artist? The "singer" or the record producer? Unfortunately these days popular music is usually created by the producer. It's a music technology game, do you really believe that half these artists know how to work the equipment to create these tracks? Artists come in the studio with some lyrics they thought up with half an idea of how it should sound, the rest (and arguably the most) is done by the producer. Record label producers are the ones who know what will work and what wont at the end of the day, the artist is just the front. Pitch is the least important thing in singing? Dude you're killing me, its the most important thing, how can you stay in key if the pitch is off? Just say you personally like the sound of autotune, and maybe you should have paid more attention in music class.
I really loved your break down of how producers and song writers utilise so many different things to make a song sound good. So many people think they have an idea of what makes a good song in their perspective and simultaneously discredit how much work goes into it. My heart broke watching him in that interview. It's one thing to get targeted by someone you've never met but something else entirely by a person you're close to and likely, in this instance, even admire.
Thanks for bringing Jacob Collier demonic reign more awareness.
Sorry I had to listen to Doja and The Weeknd again real quick & come back here 😄
sometimes it sounds really nice when their voice moves with the beat with autotune
Is this sponsered by T-Pain LMFAO
I don’t know literally anything about  T-Pain but I would die for him because you said so d’angelo.
Back in the day they actually tried an experiment where they released a boy group that couldn’t sing and solely used auto tune. That group did not last, for obvious reasons.
One time I tuned into T Pain's stream and his teenage daughter was in the background getting her hair done while she was drawing. At some point, he turned to her and asked what she was drawing and showed his chat, talking about how talented she is and how he's proud of her, and it was just so pure and wholesome. He really does seem like a super genuine, sweet man.
Artist are more than allowed to experiment with music, other wise all music would be the same, and just because in T-Pain's case his music became so popular, it's because it's actually good. He's not just a great singer, he's also a great producer and an incredible musician, the perfect person to change r&b in a good way
if you dislike autotune then listen to artists like current joys or nirvana! There are lots of artists who don't use autotune!
What if this video is a hint & the new channel is for music
I love how D'Angelo is slowly adding more colors to his once grey, black and white background
twitter :/
People just need to stop listening crap on the radio and discover the millions of others artists that the beauty of music platforms have for us and stop the hate.
Usher's "concern" had undertones of envy, he was hating, bye.
you should definitely listen to charli xcx
T Pain needs a hug and I don’t like Usher anymore for being so mean to him.  😡
She made us drinks to drink we drunk em *got drunk *
people who complain about TPain and autotune have never listened to Zapp & Roger and IT SHOWS
D’Angelo is the most unbiased commentator on yt
I remember T Pain best for that one mashup video w him singing his songs bc it's purely talent, a perfect example of his real range.. hope y'all look up the longer vid 🙏
JESUS THAT ONE GIRL
where exactly is ushers npr tinny desk??? oh ok nevermind...
“People on Twitter…” 💀
People are always free to share your opinion on the internet. But don't get your panties in a bunch when people tell you to shut up because your opinion IS MEAN and RUDE!
People also clearly cannot tell the difference between just using autotune and using a vocoder.
youtuber Sideways has a really excellent video about autotune and why it's not at all the problem people believe it to be. basically, people use the word "autotune" when they really mean "pitch correction", and pitch correction is used in literally all music production. and it's done so in a way that specifically makes sure listeners won't be able to hear it. like, it's literally just the process of getting multiple vocal takes, and fixing any mistakes by subbing in correct notes from the other takes where the singer didn't mess up. what T-Pain did was more of a stylistic choice ala Daft Punk to give his voice a certain affect. and even if all of this weren't the case, why the hell would you wake a man up out of a sound sleep just to insult him??? and how could anyone defend that???
T-pain the reason your favorite rapper uses autotune
Can't wait so see this video get claimed even when it's fair use
this. this is why i deleted my twitter account. the app is a shit show
Where is the sweatshirt from, it’s pretty cool and looks comfy✨
It blows my mind that Usher was actually mad that T-Pain did something new and innovative... in the music industry.   Like. What.
Travis with auto tune problems: 👀
Ohhhhhhhh shhhhiz! D’angelo just killed it with the OMG😹😹😹 😱🤯😵
I’ve never met him, but i share a mutual friend with him & he IS a good person! He is and always has been so talented! That is so hypocritical of him because you’re right!!! The OMG song does have auto tune 🤣🤣🤣
This was the second episode of the new Netflix show “This is Pop” right after the first episode about Boyz II Men........like holy hell did this show get off to a crazy start! The 3rd episode was about Swedish producers though...
D’angelo… LeT mE bUy U a DrAnK
"Pitch is the least important thing...". Unless you have a pitch-ear and can hear the *slightest* slip off pitch which feels like a file raking across your teeth.
WHAT cher was the first the use autotune????and in one of my favorite songs??
T pain is a national treasure
Autotune brings us the glorious 'Believe' by Cher. So Usher can suck it.
Usher must’ve been DRUNK. Where does he get off sending a FLIGHT ATTENDANT to get t pain IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SLEEP so he can tell him he messed up music. he was PRESSED. pulling his hair out all night stressed.
The most concerning part about this is usher you mean to tell me you woke that man out of his sleep on a plane to diss him fuck you dude and your usher money honestly he a fool
Twitter = something dumb went down  yanno what…facts 🤣
I would have responded “YOU fucked up music by giving us Bieber.”
people who are complaining about autotune have clearly never listened to 100 gecs
People act like using autotune magically makes you sound amazing and you don't need effort to make it sound good, if you are one of those people please go and listen to Soul Train by YBN Nahmir and try to tell me it works
T Pain is so incredibly nice and humble and the fact that people are blaming him for something that was never one persons fault is ridiculous.   Let people make interesting and stylistic choices in music!
Taylor Swift even uses autotune during her concerts but for T-Pain it’s not okay? 😂 At least he uses it as a stylized thing and not to tweak his weak voice.
Usher was just jealous that we were all paying $2.99 for t-pain ringtones constantly
No fcking way — if im t-pain & someone (especially someone i consider a friend) said I’m not making “real” music?! they are getting slapped across the face! how dare you!
No one is talking about that incredible hoodie and it's making me feel like I missed D'Angelo's merch announcement or something, but it is SO CUTE
Can u please auto tune the way you pronounce the word sinGing
D’Angelo, I have the same glasses as you. Please remove those and get better glasses. I can’t stand looking at what could have been, I don’t want to look in the mirror and feel failed in comparison.
I might agree with some of these ideas if T-Pains natural voice wasn't off the charts the man has pipes fo-sho!!
I love this man’s outlook. Love you D’Angelo
I feel like there’s been this idea that’s been passed on over the years that auto tune just instantly enhances your voice. Like with auto tune you can magically go from animal screams to Mariah Carey.  Plus people share the same ideas about music which some do in art. Apparently realism, or realistic voices are the best things and that isn’t true. You can sound like you got that robot voice but with a good beat n shit u got a good song someone will like.
I don't like how autotune sounds and tbh I listen to punk so I don't even like good singing I just hate when people try to say "that's not music" to anything that they don't personally like
Ummmmm I thought him using auto tune was his whole gig
Oh my god.i can't believe i live with people like these
When I was younger I acted like I hated tpain but as an adult I can admit, not only can the man sing he writes a hell of a good song
Urrsher living up to his shitty ass behavior as always.
guess I learned today I have taste, the same taste as D'Angelo
Honestly something about T-pain makes me want to protect him. He just seems like a nice person. And his songs will always remind me of some great times.
Even live music can be auto-tuned, it feels like pretending that all singers should be perfect 24/7  places an unfair expectation on artists, especially new and upcoming talent
Twitter expressing that they are brain dead yet again.
Everybody who agrees w usher needs to find Bandcamp
T-PAIN IS A TREASURE THE WORLD HAS TOTALLY LOST IT'S SHIT.
T Pain was always the “autotune guy” for me but then I heard the T Pain and Kurt Hugo Schneider mashup. I don’t think that way anymore.
For ppl who like thus topic check out Sideways’s video on it!! It’s more theory based and it’s great!
auto tune is literally just like makeup. it's just a cherry on top.
Well... usher gave us Justin Bieber. Im yet to forgive him for that.
T Pain yes autotune deal but he can sing. Which I think people assume it means you cant sing or lip sync. And yes people can rely on it big time... Or magically mess up... look at Disney beauty and the best and how many people cringe. Though how can you blame your job issues on another artist.
This is some “if you use reference you’re not a real artist” type clownery 🤡 🍵 ✨
Sideways made a great video about what auto tune actually is and why people use it.
Anyone who made Thug Story doesn’t deserve hate. Usher should be more careful with his words. We all should, especially if it’s for a friend.
But where is the playlist with all these amazing artists? I need more, but where do I start?
I mean I would like to hear T Pain's real singing voice, but A. that's his signature sound and B. every big artist including Usher uses Auto-Tune just not as obviously.
Wow, Usher ruined friendship.
T-Pain doesn't deserve any flak here. I'm glad you showed clips of him singing acoustically, he's got a beautiful voice.
Can we just cancel Twitter. Please?
Fuck usher for that
jacob collier is so freaking scarily talented  im horrified of this man how is he mortal i love him
what is D'Angelo's background music with the flute? It's killing me tryna remember. I think it's from a video game?
I find autotune irritating, but I also have misophonia, so a lot of sounds are irritating to me.
Wether you think auto tune is bad or not but have you heard him sing without it? His voice is wonderful!
honestly fuck usher and all the other old heads that said he 'ruined music' mfers were GROWN hating on a young man...like is that not embarrassing??
D'Angelo shouting out Willow Smith's new album made my night bc Transparent Soul is a banger I can't-
Usher was just jealous how T-Pain is a legend and can actually sing w/o autotune and with it
Truth is artists like usher are mad that artists like Tpain get to benefit from using autotune openly whilst they use it behind the scenes and Don't want people to know they do..it's the same as the Kardashians using plastic surgery and denying it or Photoshop and filters that these influencers use but deny it
Thanks for putting me onto Zapp & Roger, they're fucking fire!!!!!
10:57 roger and Zapp used a voice box, which gives a similar vibe but uses a synthesizer (or anything really) as a carrier signal to be manipulated by the incoming voice signal. Auto tune digitally manipulates the pitch of a signal to match a given pitch. Similar vibes but different results and uses
The only reason i havent gone to NASA and had them set me to the void of space, is because of d'angelo
Ain’t it late to complain about auto-tune supposedly “ruining” music for singers when we’ve had a thriving scene for literal software singing songs for legit years? I guess they knew they didn’t have the clout to say anything about Hatsune Miku…
hey D' Angelo, please look into grace vanderwaal, if you love music and lyrics that are deep....ps she is only 17, started at 12 ong agt ALL SONGS WROTE BY HER. you will keep forgetting that when listening to her lyriscs. NOT A WASTE OF YUR TIME. And I'm sure more of your followers would be interested as well.
Y’all better leave T Pain alone, he was one of my favorite R&B singers. ♥️
Who else thinks the secret project could involve music?
How the tables have turned: Artists recently are clamoring to collab with T-Pain while Usher is scamming strippers with Usher Bucks.
The honest truth is when people complain that people use technology to achieve the sound they want with their own music, the complainers are pointlessly attempting to hold music back essentially. Yes there are people that copy others and don’t really seem to try but there have ALWAYS been trends like that, and well done compositions will always stand above it on a technical level either way. There’s legitimately no actual reason to keep people from using the tools they want to when they make their art. It ain’t productive.
"5 O'clock In The Morning" is still one of the best songs ever 9 years later.  It just hits differently now that I'm fuckin 30 and got my shit together, as it did back when I was 20 and running around like a headless chicken.
Bit late
How does usher fit on plane with a head that big.
Music producer here! Autotune sounds the best when the person hits the general ballpark of the notes. T Pain excels at that, because he can actually sing. Also, the man produced just about every track he sung on. "Buy U A Drank" was basically a college guy in his bedroom studio.
Travis barkers the only good thing about transparent soul lmao the song is the most cliche trying to be deep song ever and is way to repetitive
I wish there was a love button for this!!!! so much truth baby boi!!!!! 💘💘💘
Those defending Usher r objectively......FUCKING STUPID
damn fuck usher T pain is a legend his songs were catchy as fuck!
the fact that he woke this millionaire up outta his fucken sleep just to be an asshole wtf
Wait usher is mad cuz he used autotune?  You mean like he did in the song ya? Hmm
Usher is a punk bitch who had to use a kid Justin Bieber just to prevent himself from falling off the map. Yeah, auto tune isn't great when 98% of people use it. But T-Pain used it the absolute best above anyone else and proved it could make good music. Usher thinks he is the best, while T-Pain just brings out the best I people. If you ever see this T-Pain, just know you're a real one. Usher just wishes he was a good person like you.
T-pain is a legend !! Im sprung 🎶 how’d you get me🎶🎶
Wait wait so usher is crediting tpain with popularizing auto tune?? Isn’t that kind of an amazing achievement?
Come on are we really doing this now my boy just discovered there was a secret folder for DMs from ppl he didn’t follow! He has pages upon pages from other celebrities reaching out to him asking to collab. I can’t stop thinking about the tik tok he made abt it where he was like “holy sh¡t is that fergie???” Smh & y’all killed him in his prime bc nobody on Twitter understands that pitch correction doesn’t automatically makes you a good singer & it’s a tool literally every mainstream artist uses
Art cannot be objectively “”wrong””, people don’t get that; I fucking hate most modern rap but I can respect the artistic expression
I was waiting for the Zapp & Roger mention. T-Pain is amazing and everyone should go support him on Twitch too!
usher just mad that the bartender didnt buy him drinks to drink so they could drink them and get drunk so he can think she thinks hes cool
its basically the whole “digital art is ruining art because its not a physical thing” argument but for music
I love  TPain's tiny desk concert it's soo good
any vocal editing (for either polishing or just as an effect) wouldn't have stuck around if people didn't like it. Sideways has a great video talking about people being super wrong about autotune
D’Angelo you are especially cute in this video. Excellent job
Usher woke him up in his sleep just to insult him- First of all, auto tune isn't bad And second of all, even if it was why does it matter? If someone's happy and not causing any harm i don't see the problem
Let’s be real. R&B has not declined in any way. There’s a ton of artists that are creating beautiful music in that genre they’re just extremely underrated. Usher was on some bs. T-Pain didn’t cause anyone to do anything. He’s a legend and he CAN sing.
vote to rename this: d'angello wallace fanboys over tpain for 23ish minutes
highly recommend watching "the problem with autotune" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko the guy who made this video has a music degree so it offers some professional (that's not the right word but idk what the right one would be) insight into the topic
Has usher not listened to “buy you a drink”🤨 cause that song was the song of our generation.
Usher out here giving opinions as if anyone asked.
Excuse me?! His real singing voice is, ANGELIC- who cares if he uses auto tune for effect. Protect t-pain at all costs 😤
There's also an acoustic version of "buy you a drank" and he's actually a decent singer
If you're going to complain about people using autotune i dare you to say that Jimi Hendrix's music is anything less because he regularly used pedals for his guitar.
Don’t ya ever just get tired of watching this man’s videos I’m getting exhausted with how much I gotta ketchup on
You did your first wrong life in life, you said expresso.
based
i hope usher sees this,, pouty lil baby
So ariana grnade doesn't do r & b anymore? Chilee
Honestly for some reason this made me emotional. It's so sweet how you are defending him and then dunking on usher tho lmao
Here before dangelo gets cancelled by kpop fans for saying BTS uses auto tune 😔😔
He's a really awesome dude. He does USO tours. Got to see him...puts on a good show
Going back to the guitar example, it’s also like having an electric guitar and not using any pedals. Yeah you can play a lot of songs and play them well, but using different pedals with different combinations can make something really amazing.
T-Pain can sing though!!! Like very well! And he created banger after banger lol. F Usher tbh.
Auto tune is his style and we love it. That’s what makes him stand out. We know he can sing. He won first place in mask singer. So 😒😒
Uhh usher has used auto tune tho. The audacity
If you listen to any song made within the last 30 years with words, it uses pitch-correction/auto-tune
Usher actin like he made anything memorable and not completely waste worthy.
CHLOE BAILEY REPRESENTING BOTH LOW AND HIGH RANGE
Usher a.k.a. Mr. Herpes needed to sit down.  Twitter is still being a dumpster fire.
Guys I figured it out, D'angelos gonna take over the world go subscribe to the secret channel for backstage passes
Nobodies criticizing respected artists for being innovative in their art. Nuke twitter
a perfect example of bad auto tune is kim kardashians song from the early 2000s
I’d love to see anyone try to do T pain wrong lmao like legit all the shit he’s been releasing is top tier.
As soon as I heard him say twitter I knew it was about to be dumb
Plus you can't even find the secret chanel by searching for it. I feel like an Illuminati ore sh*
Did you just say masego? Wow yall have taste
Honestly, I don't really care if an artist uses autotune or not. If their song sounds good then I'll listen to it, if I don't like it then it's just not made for me. It kinda seems elitist and misinformed for us to gatekeep artists in their crafts just because we don't personally like it or because we have this unrealistic standard for singers to always be perfect in singing
T-Pain….I noticed you said you went to the BACK of the plane to talk to Usher. 😂
T pain of course is behind the song my daughter won’t stop singing on purpose! He’s still phenomenal and usher was outta line
I’ve listened to and thoroughly enjoyed more T-pain in my life than Usher. Buy You a Drink slaps to this day
So Usher didn’t catch T-Pain winning The Masked Singer huh?
“Drankin Patna” is a BOP is will forever be a BOP! I don’t even drink anymore and it still gets me lit lmao I loved T-Pain’s auto tuned music, it was fun! And to meeee Brent Faiyaz and many others are killing the R&B game.
The other thing is you can usually tell if someone is a good vocalist regardless of the tuning processing on the vocal. If the tone is thin or the melody sounds really chopped up and spliced together to complete each phrase (and obviously not on purpose) you can tell that this person isn't necessarily a talented vocalist- BUT that doesn't mean that they aren't a talented performer or an intriguing persona with something to offer in the delivery of the vocal.
Thank you for teaching the people your age, & younger & some music history :)!
T pain is literally the nicest most down to earth artist in the genre! He is the last man who deserves this shit what the fuck. That’s so uncalled for, especially from a peer he respected and loved. I hope the percentage of people defending him are louder in the end and he sees that he hasn’t ruined anything.
I'm so glad to see D'Angelo is back doing his normal thing, and talking about something that makes him feel better. I completely understand and respect needing to take breaks for mental health, I encourage it whenever creators talk about it, but I also get worried when people I care about are going through shit.
I do believe that T-pain popularised autotune in the R&B scene and it sucked cause some couldn't live up to his songs, so it was just a never ending trend but that's how radios work. Like I'm still hearing Zedd on 102.5 but I ain't complaining. Nah... I got my phone out and searched up the music I liked. Like he DIDN'T ruin music😒✋ tf?
I cannot imagine having the entitlement, let alone the audacity, to wake T-Pain up in first class, make him come back to where I'm sitting, and lecture him for inspiring people to use auto-tune. Crying babies on a plane are less terrible than Usher on a plane.
Lonely by Swamp Dogg. As the young people say “slaps”.
I can't stop hearing how D'Angelo emphasizes the g in sinGing and sinGer like Ethan Klein
Anyone know what that FKA Twigs clip is from?
1. Your not wrong Usher was completely out of pocket.  2. You are correct,  he has a great voice! Without auto tune.  3. Is it out of pocket of me to ask for artists that your listen to lately...?    Side note: Also, Are we going to ignore Kisha cole? We really gonna over look artists getting put on because the pretty when they can't sing for salt? Usher wanna call anybody out, he probably should have called her out. But hey, I'm just being petty for t-pain at this point.
T-pain is awesome! Can't wait to dive into his work for a swim without radio picking it for moi!
t pains music defined a generation honestly
Didn’t he already get cancelled for auto tune  years ago, and that’s why he stopped making music
Dangelo is this just covering yourself for your birthday song to ethan? ;)
Hahahaha nice silver plays D'Angelo 🖤😈🤘🏿 sending all the hugs and high fives 🤓
can we talk about dangelo’s camera quality
Well then hyperpop artists must be on death row
ugh this one hurts. i grew up on their most iconic songs and never once considered one to be inferior due to their style, just different! i think its an important point; the use of auto-tune is literally a style! just because it's become a more popular tool in music within the last 10-15 years, i truly believe it doesn't take away from the music thats produced without it. a good musician/singer/artist/whatever is still good, whether they use various tools to create their work or not. T-Pain makes good music, and regardless of how; there's no denying its still good!
I fucking love t-pain I’m 32 and i still bang his music in my car hahahaha idgaf I love him so so so much. **blaring “bartender” right now**
that pisses me off bc T-Pain is actually a great singer. not decent, not good, but GREAT. it's not like he's some crackpot who can't sing that got away with it by using over-autotuning. he's a great singer and his autotune was an artistic choice. it's kind of like how people tell abstract artists that their art isn't 'real' just because THEY don't regard it as art. T-Pain uses copious amounts of autotune in a specific way because that's how he adds colour and interest to his vocals. people would've started using a shit ton of autotune anyways just to cover up the fact that they can't sing or rap - it's not like T-Pain is somehow to blame for that
If you can hear autotune, you messed up. T pain is using it as an instrument. Where is the outrage for daft punk doing the same thing lol?
I've seen him live. He is an amazing singer. He is humble and is real. The audience was amazed by how hard he performed. I love Usher but he was upset that he took a long break from music and things had changed.  He needs to work on being humble.... Just because you're famous does not mean we'll automatically buy what you are selling.
usher seems a bit jealous tbh..... but u didn't hear that from me...
Whats the griff song??
I love your music commentary videos! I’m glad you’re doing more happy content and not just discussing bad people on the internet.
13:48 two small artists lmao
Who is that/what is that song at 15:15?
You have such great taste in music, D'Angelo 🎶❤️
usher can’t say anything when he was hanging out with 16 year olds less than a year ago for new age clout
T-Pain doesn't need auto-tune, auto-tune needs T-Pain
if anything has been ruined its country because its just all the same nowadays
Usher is just jealous 🙄
Not D’angelo using the Dixie clip lmaoooo
And Roger and Zapp SLAP! (I'm a 80s baby lol)
I love your hoodie 🥺
psh, usher never f*d a mermaid
excited for canyon county <3 u
Tpain is immensely talented, he was very intentional when he wanted to use autotune. He said he downloaded a bunch of programs trying to find the autotune effect, it took him over a YEAR! He said he didn’t want to sound like everybody else. It’s not his fault that people tried to copy him and they didn’t do it well, that happens a lot lol. Music is art, and you can experiment in many different ways, it’s not always a golden voice.
I like that you pronounce singing with a hard G like Ethan Klein ❤️
Yo, do y’all not remember Cher’s “Believe”? It wasn’t just rnb, because every genre started using autotune. I’d say Kanye’s 808s & Heartbreak is more responsible than T Pain and that album is a classic.
ngl, i’m only 4:30 into the video, but i feel i should just point this out from what i’ve heard so far before i forget: i will say that r&b has been taken over by a LOT of ppl who HEAVILY rely on the use of autotune (prime example and first thought: SZA), but to say t-pain is the cause for, and i hate to use this word, normalizing lazy vocalists in modern r&b? ummmmm that’s a stretch if i heard it. people LIKE the processed shit and they listen to it…it sells…listeners actively choose to listen to what they want…so if you wanna hear real r&b, whatever that means to you, go listen to it? Brent Faiyaz, , Inyah Lamis (i might’ve spelled that wrong), Giveon…etc
I personally don’t like the sound of a lot of auto tune, but it didn’t ruin the music industry if anything it made it way better, nobody should be canceled over this
T Pain's tiny desk performance is literally God's gift to us all
So I'm gonna say something that people might not like. But first of all I love auto tune and original recipe T-Pain's voice.  But, I will say that even though it hurt his feelings Usher did what an actual friend would do, he told him how he felt privately wether it's wrong or right, he told him something privately not on any social media. The only reason we know about it is because T-Pain said it.. some of the same people saying Usher was wrong are the same people that would say Usher should have said it to him privately because they were friends.  That said, do I think auto tune became a crutch to mediocre singers? Yes, because I actually heard some of the singers that sounded good on an album or certain "live"  performances, but sounded horrible in several different other real live performances.  So, while I agree that auto tune isn't magic. Around the time that T-Pain made it more popular there were artists that sounded like sh!t without auto tune as well as other digital voice modifications, but I don't think T-Pain ruined anything nor do I believe he is in anyway cancelled.   Also, I'm 36 so I remember T-Pain when him and auto tune were "new"
You know what’s crazy me & my brother was literally talking about this an hour ago.
The Auto tunes sound overwhelmed music because people copied T Pain. That’s not his fault. Even his old rap group attacked him after he got famous for using Auto tunes. I met him when he was in his old group and again at his first album release party. T Pain is a really solid person but a lot of famous artists were jerks to him while using his sound especially Usher & Kanye.
singger
This came out really early in where i live. Your voice is really soothing it comes like ASMR to me sometimes. I’m still a bit sleepy and i might fall asleep while listening lol.
I have 0 problem with autotune, but when it completely replaces your voices with robot sounds...the "artist" needs to actually get good at singing. The method that takes the best syllables from multiple recordings is MUCH more respectable in that sense as the singer has to ACTUALLY sing the song, and does it several times over for the sole purpose of making sure every syllable has at least one decently pitched instance. Again, nothing wrong with autotune - when shifting pitch is NEEDED for someone who cannot physically reach a certain pitch they want - like maybe their range ends a few notes under what their song needs, shifting that is totally okay, and should be encouraged, honestly!  Ultimately, I don't even like traditional music (mostly into VGM, almost exclusively) so I don't even know why I'm here tbh -I kept trying to skip the music clips and could not physically move my mouse fast enough to click past HELP MEEEEEEE-
I love demonic singing 😍🤩🥰🤓🤘🏿😈🎃
What kind of flight attendant wakes up a 1st class passenger at the request of another passenger? I would flip out and become a Karen monster getting her reported.
She👩🏽made👩🏽‍🍳us👫🏽drinks🥂to✌🏽drink😩we👩🏾‍❤️‍👨🏾drunk🥴em🍻
i would go to bat for t-pain so fast, that man is so sweet and talented he deserves nothing less than the best
I’m so glad he mentioned Roger & Zapp omg he’s cultured!
His NPR tiny desk concert is amazing, I revisit it often. His auto-tune songs slap too!
He is so incredibly talented without the autotune! He shouldn’t be shamed for his creative choice to use autotune to create a unique sound. If people liked that and chose to try and replicate it (poorly) it’s not his fault.
Let’s give T-Pain his much deserved roses.
If  T-Pain didn’t use autotune someone else would, and probably would be used today.
The REAL problem here is that he woke the man from a nap to insult him!!!
Somebody needs to talk to these people or get them a drink.
Aww Tpain in that interview. It was the sigh, you can tell that was a hard time in his life.
Omg yessss for the Willow plug!! I love me some Willow Smith!
Who else wanted to give T-Pain a huge hug? And to throw eggs at Ushers house. Whose coming with me?
Oh and btw it was Cher who destroyed pop music with auto tune. She didn't even do it well. Tpain shreds and that's on that.
the line “honey got some b00bies like w0w Oh wOw” really unlocked some 2010 memories for me 😵‍💫
Everybody. Go watch T Pain's tiny desk concert. Incredible.
People out here hating autotune haven't heard the FNF songs ig 💅
T-Pain is a legend. I was so excited to see him in the new Girlfriend Reviews video.
They will NOT come for my T Pain! 🤬 👊🏻
Shoobeedobe shoodeebe I wanna love you 🎶Hey!, Computer Love that's mah song!
It made me so sad. He deserves much respect. I also enjoyed the scenes with him and his wife. They were adorable.
I’m calling it now, the secret project is an album/musical project of some kind
t pain’s music is literally the best and has been for years and i met him irl and he’s really nice :)
This logic is the same as saying Jojo Siwa ruined children’s toys because she is popular. Like.. no? You can still find cute kids toys unrelated to her, but a lot of people love her style and whatever. The majority of toy isles in stores aren’t even covered in Jojo. Like that’s such an illogical stance to make, tpain doesn’t even have the ability to ruin music. If anything he made it better by showing us the abilities of digitally modified music.
Agree with u on everything except that autotune can not make a lousy singer sound good. I’ve seen too many people prove the opposite. Btw, NOT saying I think he can’t sing or that Usher wasn’t a big jerk
Like Cher's Believe wasn't released a whole 10 years before Thr33 Ringz. It was already happening.
My meds have been making me depressed, this video made me happy
Me and my sister. We have a thing where if we're bummed someone will just "APPLE BOTTOM JEANS. BOOTS WITH THE FUR." Never fails. It's the cure try it.
Who hates on TPain? The man is great and I love his auto tune!
damn that's really stupid like he's hella trash lmao why does it matter
"two random small artists" DANGELO 😭😭😭
Someone give T-Pain a hug man -❄️🔥
Does anyone know where to get his sweatshirt?? It looks so good!

Everything you consume is edited.
I meannnn......I don't really care. I don't mind the auto tune as I don't see anything wrong with that😅😅😅
Honestly music isn't (only) about the vocals, it's primarily about how it makes you feel. You don't need to have a good voice, you just have to have good lyrics and heart.
This made me very happy, especially the clip at the end of T-pain singing. I love watching your videos, you always bring my mood up. Can't wait to find out what your new channels all about! <3
OMG HI D'ANGELO I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN UWU *fangirl face activated*
YAAAASSSSSS WE LOVE SHAMIR!!!!! 🧚🏻💟✨
T-Pain is such a cool person. He's twitch clips are AMAZING.
t pain didnt deserve this
Didn’t Usher use autotune too? 🤔
The crazy part is T-Pain won the first season of The Masked Singer because he wanted to prove he was more than just his gimmick. Which he did since he won
Music is music human in the end of the world  no matter what it is still music :]
D’Angelo, this was my favorite video you’ve made yet. I LOVE T-Pain, and I agree that it was painful to watch the hurt he was feeling from Usher’s comment.   I’m a high school teacher, and you’re the type of creator that I hope my students watch. Thank you!
Dude, auto tune makes up a lot of the music I listen to. 😂 the asthetic auto tune sounds good when done right~ like get off your high horse and go listen to people do Kareoke if you don’t like auto tune~
Usher needs to apologize
Love this
Have you never listened Ari Lennox? Have you never listened to Chris Brown? Have you never listened to Kaash Paige? Hello lol
I'm onboard with most of this, but saying we wouldn't have Post Malone, etc. without T Pain I doubt would be a selling point to Usher or those who agree with him. I don't care for any of those artists you mentioned with Post Malone, I actually haven't cared much for American music for the last decade with the exception of Ariana Grande, Cardi B, and Halsey. But, I have no issues with auto-tune, I think it's great for the genre I prefer, kpop, because the most popular acts have pressure to put out amazing choreo. I've heard my faves sing without auto-tune, I know they can. Although, I'm someone that loves watching intricate choreo, and can appreciate the talent it takes to sing and dance, if auto-tune is used as a tool to help them out... I don't care.
Nope that is wrong. If the pitch is off, nothing sounds good. Pitch plus all those that you have described are important. The whole package.
Yea, definitely I agree that Usher said that to Tpain out of bitterness. His music was not doing well in the new age, and yea... that OMG was him imitating Tpain because he felt that's the only thing that worked now. And he saw it did work. And I think he was super bitter about it and said that to Tpain while tispy. It was super mean. Tpain never got the clout he deserved and his friend let him go all these years thinking he isn't an icon. Its tragic.
I’m so confused tpain is such a sweet genuine person. He’s a rare jewel in the music industry
Thank you D'Angelo. Above all this video makes me happy about how many different kinds of music exists. It's beautiful.
Usher talking like his own voice is extraordinary. It sounds like too clean for my tastes, too perfect, which is more 'bad use of autotune' vibes than stylistic autotune for me. I get Usher's voice technically, and it's good, it's just frustrating that he'd think it's a pinnacle of artistry to the point that he'd have the audacity to say what he said to T Pain.
I met T-pain, he was sort of an asshole. After a college concert, he went to a local bar and so did most of the students. He was really rude to all of us that PAID to see him. Mind you he also showed up an hour late....Still, sucks he got depressed I guess
autotune isn't pitch-correction. it's a filter. and pitch-correction happens all the god damn time. live and in the studio.
Listen, whenever a mood is dying at a club or party I always request "Low". Never fails to bring the hype back. Everyone knows T-Pains lines, even my 57 year old dad 😂
Fun fact: you 10000% can pitch correct and auto tune live performances. Today it’s rare NOT to have pitch correction live. It’s so seamless it’s nearly impossible to notice.
💓
Not the d’amelio clip rofl
With all the strife going on in the world, freakin twitter comes for ... T Pain.
D'Angelo putting out some more wholesome content and doing what makes him happy makes me happy. I love to support people that do good in this often dark world. Much love to you!
Plenty of people in the music industry; if not all, have been using auto-tune for years on end without problem, but all of the sudden it is now? Twitter is a different breed of stupidity. Plus, you have to be somewhat be good at singing  for auto-tune to work. It ain't just going to make you sound perfect. Auto-tune; paired with a good singing voice with vocals makes it better. But, Auto-tune paired with a bad singing voice with bad vocals makes you sound like a dying deer. As many people have said; it's just an enhancement if used correctly.
hey d'angelo have you  listened to call me if you get lost yet ?
T-Pain is a straight up icon and no body can do what he does.
*People canceling t-pain over auto tune* Cher: i just sit back and observe 👀       Btw this is not meant to attack Cher in any way🙏🏾
I think there is a lot of gate keeping in the music world, potentially more with more accessible instruments like voice or guitar.  There’s also this weird culture (at least in the jazz and bluegrass scene) of kind of hating singers because they aren’t  “real” musicians but then they get a lot of the attention from audiences.  So perhaps it is some internalized gate keeping from that culture plus just general assholery.
Okay but have they not watched the first season of masked singer?
T pain is a highly under appreciated artist.
I laughed so hard seeing the notif ngl HSJSHAHDSHHD
Yo this! But he should still be looked at sideways eye with his Twitter post about that short boy and Meg Thee Stallion.
T-Pain does not use auto-tune in an attempt to correct his voice or vocals, Leave that to Dixie Damelio. He uses it as an effect for his music, while he doesn't need it, it is used to match his style of music.
why does it matter if theres auto tune if you like the song lol if you dont vibe with it then skip and listen to something else ?? nbd
T-Pain had an amazing choice, regardless. He's an artist using a tool.
I have to say this as I am watching this video, I am getting more and more heated, and have lost all respect for Usher, the hypocrite uses auto tune himself, then has the audacity to put someone else down, just because T-Pain is more popular than him, what a disgusting, horrid, vile, two- faced poor excuse for a human being
Chloe and fka twigs my beloved
Usher wasn't raised right. What parent doesn't tell their kid "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all"... Bruh get over yourself. Nasty.
Today I found out people who hate T Pain exist. Sad world we're living in.
2:31 - I was thinkin the same thing.... If I'm asleep - do not wake me up. 🤨 And the attendant shouldn't have awaken T-Pain for Usher.  What made her think Usher was of such importance, and the other mans sleep was not important!? Smh.
Usher owes T Pain a VERY PUBLIC apology. That's a damn shame he said that to that man. I've had many times in life of people speaking like that to me too and being extremely mean for no reason. It is. Deeply hurtful and DOES affect you and get to you. People don't know WTF they do with their words and I really don't understand it.
How come when you mentioned Verb Energy I thought a solar energy company sponsored you
Maaaan my boy TP made autotune what it is fuck y'all even talking about
03:30 yeah but imagine a friend and probably a HUGE musical inspiration telling you that, devastating
Usher saying that to T-Pain is like when girls complain about other girls who wear "cake-ky" make-up, even though they wear "natural" make-up.
Not Gonna lie, the idea of the channel with nothing on it, ....... Love it.  .. Algorithm
T-Pain is iconic & so is Usher. I don't even understand how they could have problems with each other. Smh
But …but… he carries it so well 😩. The guy is a icon. A ton of his songs were literally hits.
Everyone needs to leave my baby T-pain alooonnnneeeeee
T-Pain has one of the most incredible voices of all time. Usher really doesn't need to be acting up with all his foolishness.
Usher sounds like a super toxic “friend”
Bruh, T-Pain didn’t ruin music or R&B, he evolved it. Usher was just salty that the industry was changing in a way that didn’t benefit him. He peaked in his Confessions days lmaooo
T Pain's voice is just a blessing
In this video, i kind of feel you just said "No" to everyone's differing opinion. Autotune might be really good for you, but some people just dislike how it sounds. Me included. I'm not saying auto tone isn't real music, I'm saying I think, most of the time, it sounds bad and all the same.  And I mean, the reasoning that "Just because you don't like autotune doesn't mean you should discard a bunch of songs!" So just... scanning through a genre you know you hate, in the hopes that you might just find an exception? Eating a bunch of caramel treats when you don't like caramel in the hopes of finding one exception? Sounds kind of... pointless.
1:18 did you say "express-o"
How is it that D'Angelo looks younger than he did almost 2 years ago
Usher the guy who made his own money.
auto tune and other softwares made music even better  i said what i said
People criticising auto-tune are straight up ignorant. Is it overplayed and added without thought? Sure on some cash-grabbing music where it's just thrown in there for no reason. But T-Pain paved the waved the way for that shit and gave his music a unique style. He has a nice voice and lyricism, auto-tune is a stylistic choice not a crutch.
Everyone should go check out T Pain’s NPR Tiny Desk concert. Amazing.
People can no longer look down on autotune because EVERY ARTIST has done it now, including the greats. Even Usher himself has dabbled in it since T Pain came out. Usher was a D for that which is a shame because I LITERALLY grew up on him. Since elementary school when he 1st came out, can't believe he would act like that or say that to anyone
3:30 dangelo can you stop making the stories about you all the time. Please and thank you
If you use T-Pain and you can't sing, you just sound like Ice JJ Fish, who is ALSO an icon.
Literally before you even spoke:  Me: babayyygirl what’s your name , lemme talk to ya lemme buy you a draaaank 🎶   T pain is great. I legit don’t wanna hear anyone’s nonsense .
Yes!  I love Roger and Zapp 😊❤
So glad you made this vid!!! T-pain can not be forgotten!!!
“Two random small artists idk” 🤣🤣🤣
Oosher
i just realize theres a korean singer that exclusively sings with auto-tune as well, and when it becomes so obvious that they are using auto-tune, maybe you should think that it is done purposefully as a style and you can chose to not listen to it if you think its bad
Was that Rasheeda in T-pains video???? 🔥
"T-Pain done fucked up music" -Jasmine Usher Masters
I hate everybody!! Hahaha
Tpain doesn’t need auto tune, auto tune needs Tpain
That sounds an awful lot like jealousy or is it just me? In the past few years, I've heard T-Pain's name mentioned a lot more than Usher. Not saying that either artist is better than the other... that's just how the entertainment industry is.  Edit: Also, seeing T-Pain's face after that reporter questioned him on the incident with Usher, really hurt my heart. I mean... you could just see how painful that was for him.
*WHAT?* TPain is hilarious, I love his twitch streams and doesn’t like,,, everyone use auto tune nowadays anyway??? this is so stupid.
Baby girl what's your name lemme talk to you lemme buy you a drink
*two small artists idk* 🥲
In any case, it's not useful to blame one artist at one point in their career for such a major pivot like the popularization of autotune... no one exists in a vacuum; all of the factors that created an environment to allow T-Pain to use autotune in an artful way were there for other artists, he is just recognized for it. Those seeds root far and wide
Autotune took music to another level. There's nothing inauthentic about it, it's JUST art. And art is constantly evolving. What we NEED to discuss is who's responsible for mumble rappers. That's what I want to know 😆
So ANYONE who changes their voice in a song is canceled, no matter even if they still wrote/sung the song…
Also, he seems like a sweet dude.  I'm glad he's doing better now.
The craziest places on the world: Twitter and Florida
People really use instruments as a crutch for singing. Ever since the drums were invented, musicians are so lazy. These hacks don't even know how to keep a rhythm without help. Music will never be the same
d'angelo's starting a content house
Didn't usher SA a girl or a few?
I don't know why but I liked this without thinking about it.  It's not really a habit for me to do that so apparently t-pain is hypnotic ^_^;;
When Usher took a hiatus T-Pain was that guy who all the rapper and other R&B artist wanted to collab with. Ik cause I love Soul and R&B and Usher came back doing pop music like how tf you gonna hate on what you did.
this was so lovely and healing in so many ways thank you
Usher’s such a hater ugh
bruh I love autotune lmaoo
Yo did anyone else used to have the T Pain microphone??? Didn’t the sound go something like “I can sound like T Pain ~oooOooh OooooOh ooooh OOOh~ its ya boy T Pain” (I forgot the rest but still I can’t be the only one that remembers 😭)
Don’t want to use auto tune? Then don’t use it. It’s that simple Usher. The comments weren’t necessary.  T-Pain is a great musician.
2:09 yeah i'm legit panicked over his expression. poor guy doesn't deserve this BS.  *edit* ok it just got worse and i just want to hug him and remind him that he's ICONIC for being him  also unlike usher he's not boring af
If i was T Pain I would be like "Yeah... so" but that's just me.
"two random artists idk" I love it lmao
Is D’Angelo planning on overthrowing the government or something?
saying that "auto tune isn't real music" is the same as saying "digital art isn't real art" like they're both just different tools, and ways of doing the same thing, both ways are great, and one isn't harder than the other
Wow!  You mentioned Masego.  I love Masego! ❤ He's handsome and you're handsome, too 😘❤
i hope tpain sees this cause his feelings were hurt for no good reason and this video is a solid bandaid <3
He seems like a genuinely nice person and it makes me sad seeing him sad
twitter is the internet’s version of the annoying kid at the restaurant
Agree with you on everything but pitch is very important
Once again this Anna oop energy
No, not just imagine saying that to someone, imagine TELLING A FLIGHT ATTENDANT TO GO WAKE THAT PERSON UP, *THEN* SAYING THAT TO SOMEONE. Like the fact that he randomly needed T-Pain woken up while they're ON A PLANE, just to tell him that is like um? What? Why? I cannot wrap my head around that. It makes me angry and I'm not even involved!
wish people saw him as monster on masked singer season 1 cuz he sounded so good w/o autotune
I was just watching this today. Man fuck Usher for saying that to that beautiful soul.
not d'angelo calling weeknd and ari two random artists... i mean who are they xD
The “T-Pain/Autotune ruined music” has the same energy as “digital artists ruined art”. Like, no? They’re both skills that take a while to learn and don’t magically make everything better.
weird compliment but I love all the examples you showed I appreciate not having to look shit up 🙏
Autotune does not equal lack of talent lmao. If you dont like the sound of it, that's different. That's just preference. Almost all singers use autotune nowadays. Doesn't mean they're not talented. Heck using autotune ain't even easy. It's just preference these days.
I’m so confused because I literally just listened to today’s episode of Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me with T-Pain as the guest and was talking to my mom who watched The Masked Singer and she was telling me how he went on to prove to people that he could actually sing, since he popularized extra stylized auto tune in pop music. He won that first season of The Masked Singer (without using auto tune obvs) and my mom was saying he was amazing on it. So after we listen to the new Wait Wait episode and talk about that, I go to YouTube only to see this video first on my recommended. What the hell??
Did your background change. Or have I just not watched your videos in a while
This is an awesome upload. 👏  I’m like everyone needs to go back and listen to  granddaddy Jimi Hendrix if they want to get bitchy about music “alteration”; tell me that man didn’t invent.. um.. everything. Including the foundation for every single guitar pedal overflowing the shelves behind every white boomer guitar bro channel.   Sound alteration in music IS music. From the first reed flute used to manipulate air into notes, to a skin stretched across a gourd to make a drum. It’s sound manipulation. All of it.  If the use of tech in sound gets anyone up in their feelings then they need to go back to banging on a tree and clapping.  Also; you don’t have to like it for it to be valid.  Full stop.  Corporate infiltration, appropriation,  and greed ruined the mainstream music industry.
Can you imagine having been that flight attendant? Like definitely saying "oh no, he's sleeping" and having to wake T-Pain up only to overhear that *this* was the urgent conversation Usher needed to have. Woof.
I literally just watched that episode on Netflix
Love u t pain ❤️💕
lol its at 6.9k likes
Tons of T-Pain hits weren’t even that auto tuned. I recognized him on The Masked Singer immediately. He can really, really sing. I love his NPR stuff.
Okay so as someone who really hates modern music, T-Pain did absolutely NOTHING wrong. Also Usher isn't that great either. I hate how technological music has become but that has been a complete culture shift. I actually really like T-Pain, Usher was just being an insecure, envious, asshole.
Just reading the title made me choke on my banana.... Who are these "Y'all" people tryna cancel T-Pain now🙄
This 👏🏻 sweater 👏🏻 slaps 👏🏻
We don’t deserve T Pain.
I miss the crochet hats :(
Chopped n Screwed was the first song that made me realize that i wanted to learn more about music production. I’m really glad that he helped make auto tune less “taboo” to a lot of people
Excuse me but bartender is a great damn song and no one can’t convince me otherwise
Hey! Just wanted to say that seeing your videos in my notification box brings me so much joy. No matter what the videos about, just hearing your thoughts and opinions about things makes me interested in things I never knew about. I’m sure that I have watched your hour long vids at least 5 times each. I know I don’t speak for everyone but I wanted to let you know that you are a source of serotonin for at least one person. <3
Team T-Pain 😎
No the people the actually destroyed music was honestly almost every rapper in 2020-2021
What is the internet at this point.
Even before you showed the "bad autotune"clip, I just KNEW it would be from one of Dixie's songs lol
????? T-Pain had some real good songs. Twitter really losing it.
Aight got my list of the best people in existence:   Dolly Parton T Pain D’angelo Wallace
"People on twitter"....... yeah you're right. You DON'T need to finish that sentence because the 1st thought in ANY human's mind with those 3 words is "foolishness" 🤣
I wish I could like this more than once, thank you for this video. I always liked T-Pain and bumped his songs with my friends, and then Freaknik came out and we watched that probably once a week for a year. I’ve been a huge fan of him ever since. He’s a legend.
T Pain is so talented! "You fucked up music for real singers" gtfoh. I'm not big into autotune but his songs are catchy ag and his tiny desk show was fire.
I completely agree with this video. Though, what I think those people were trying to say is that it allows for people who can't sing to become "singers". To which I would tell people, that is a tale as old as time, before they just used ghost singers, now they just use pitch correction and autotune lol
im dying cuz of the "two random small artists idk" part 💀💀💀
I’ve tirelessly argued this for years and finally, FINALLY, I feel understood 🙏🏽 From now on, I’m just sending this video and saving myself the unreasonable amount of stress I put myself under fighting for T-Pain. He’s a legend. An icon.
auto tune can be good if the person using it knows what they’re doing and T-Pain obviously does
idk if this is related but sugarcrash anyone?
He was absolutely amazing on the masked singer and I love him so much more because of it.
TPain brought some of the most wonderful songs of Florida history as a young rapper y’all better honor that man
Kinda ironic usher thinks that, considering he has worked with Summer Walker before who puts a lot of auto tune in her music. For reference I LOVE summers music and that girl can sang with or without auto tune. I’m simply just pointing that out for y’all.
You and T-Pain look familiar in the thumbnail
"D-did I fuck up music?"  No no no you didn't please I'll cry 😢😭🤧
i was about to ask how is d'angelo always so on point with his opinion, but we all already know why
Check out his gaming streams, he's pretty hilarious.
Evermore from beauty and the beast live action. Auto tune vs no auto tune. Barely any difference. But it helps. Most people use auto tune. This is different though. Like for that it’s if slightly off pitch and if someone takes a loud breath. T pain on the other hand auto tune is the point. Cause it sounds cool. And also that’s doesn’t sound like correctional auto tune. Like robotic filter kind of. So if your a terrible singer then it will sound bad. Yeah. That’s my thoughts
Can we cancel Usher?
I'm loving Willow Smith's music right now...
We are lucky to exist in the same world as D'Angelo Wallace.
If you’re bad at singing, autotune isn’t going to fix all of your problems. It’s not like autotune is going to magically, seamlessly blend your voice in and out of notes.
Why the fuck would you go and hurt that man? He's incredible. Usher needs to knock it off.
Send these ppl Moses sumney as proof that vocals are very much alive
T Pain has a gorgeous voice without auto-tune. I had only heard his auto-tuned stuff and was indifferent to it (not a fan of auto-tune period). When I heard the Monster sing on the Masked Singer, I was HOOKED. When it turned out to be him, I was sold. Such a talented man. ❤
I think autotune is to music as digital art/3d animation/modeling is seen in visual art. A lot of people scoff at it and act like it's  cheap (or God forbid "the computer did all the work") compared to how it's done traditionally when they're literally just different tools/mediums lol. The way you use it makes it valuable/better/tasteful/skillful (or not if done poorly, it all comes down to YOUR skill and how much work you put into it). I find this ironic since digital artists seem to thrive on Twitter...welp, Twitter is a cesspool so, not too surprised I guess.
1000% agree w/ this whole video. I think it’s so important to also highlight how T-Pain took something, paved his own way and was original - and it’s impact was so great, that it has inspired/influenced artists today. Idk about you but being able to live through and watch that in real time is super cool
I don't understand why people can't just learn how to sing. It's a skill like guitar playing, you can learn how to do it. I don't hate autotune, but when it's overused I just lose interest tbh.
Can somebody please help: Is the music in the background of this video some kind of video game soundtrack? It sounds so familiar!
As someone who was signed, I can agree that when all artists record music they all have vocal manipulation. That's what annoys me when artists are pitted together saying so and so doesn't use autotune. I'm like boy oh boy lol. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Massive respect for mentioning Melodyne Edit: This entire video was such an educated take (coming from a sound recording technology student). u dropped ur crown king. Lol I should have known D'angelo knows his shit when it comes to music, but I feel like he doesn't flex his knowledge on the subject enough
How is its T-pain fault? We brought the music. We played and danced to T-Pain songs and others at the clubs. T-pain did not kill male RnB singers. We the consumer killed RnB singers because we  just did not want to hear that music  anymore or dance to it at clubs. Sorry Usher. You are just not as popular anymore.
canceling is real
Holy shit I already loved this when you were talking about the intricacies of music production, BUT WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP JACOB COLLIERRR THOOO
What is this nonsense?
People who are saying Usher is right sound like they don't even listen to Usher.
This whole video 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾😩
REVIEW THE NEW TYLER ALBUM
It's not T pain's fault that people took auto tune and made a trash, t-Pain's auto tune was great and then people took that and made a trash that is not his fault
The two random small artists ydk sound really good
Buttt....he can sang too tho, like frfr
People who complain about auto tune ruining music probably don’t know anything about music.
*Rick Beato has entered the chat*
Wanna know how T-Pain is a beast?  I'm pretty sure "I'm Sprung" is Auto-Tune Free and we can't tell. Them harmonies are just amazing af.
Usher's music is good and everything, but T-Pain positively influenced music in a way Usher could only hope for. Also was Usher a part of the iconic classic "I'm On A Boat"
T-Pain is cool.
t-pain seems like such a gentle soul, he doesn't deserve the hate :( he's an icon
Plus T-Pain would 100% murder and teabag Usher in Call of Duty.
As a digital artist, I use a lot of tools to help transform my artwork to see it how I originally imagined. If a musical artist does the same with auto tune, who am I to judge?
The tea of Pain ☹️🥺😭
Ay the end of the day autotune is a STYLISTIC CHOICE for example rock artist usually aren’t the Best singers but the songs still slap however in rap and rnb (but especially rnb) already have a good singing voice like t pain,toosii, lil uzi, etc. But they do anyways cause that’s the sound there going for
D'Angelo just flexing his music knowledge for 23 minutes. I see Tpain as a modern George Clinton. Glad he got over his depression. I hope he continues to feel proud of himself for all he's done for music and on his own terms.
D'Angelo: talking about things good singers have and showing clips  Me a kpop fan: thinking of things kpop idols have done that could fit in every category
D'Angelo rocking his own merch design we love to see it
... ya, OK USHER... 🙄🥱
“Usher was my friend...” 😭
Usher........ who danced with a baby Justin Bieber..... and released music w him when he was 13......... and defended Yummy???? That Usher?????????? Wants to give serious critiques on other musicians? LmAO
What should I do when I finish watching your videos on both channels
I know that's an important subject...but that merch though 😯🔥😍
Usher is a hater and T-Pain is an unproblematic saint who must be protected at all costs.
Buy u a drink was my first ringtone on my razr flip phone. This was the jam back in the day
a strong reminder of the fact that you can never know just how long your words will stay with someone
Autotune is great. Fun fact: it helped Charlie Puth learn how to sing.
T-Pain wrote and sang backup vocals for Bruno Mars’ last album. He wrote some of our favorite songs. He’s more than a singer. He’s an artist and an icon. We don’t cancel icons for being icons.
You know what struck me was how T-Pain talked about his wife in Netflix's show. He's an alright dude.
in my experience working in the music industry where we sell a bunch of music software such as Melodyne 5, Antares: Auto-Tune (auto tune, pitchcorrecting software) Cubase, FL Studio, Pro Tools, etc i feel Melodyne (auto tune software) is like photoshop for a vocalist. it first of all is a tool which can be used for plenty of purposes. it can be used for distortion, it can re-harmonize vocals, and most notoriously, it can correct notes that are maybe out of tune, sometimes you dont want to perform an extra take (recording) since the mixing engineers can fix their voice in post production. its kinda like photoshopping pimples out ya nice picture your fond of. sure you can always wait for your face to clear up, but we live in the future. We have tools that can make the things were not all that fond of go away. but in the wrong hands, the intentions become alittle less noble and way more distorted and uncanny in certain cases.  maybe what usher was trying to say was that there are people who would rather perform music in there natural voice, instead of using Melodyne (autotune) as a crutch to augment and mask their voice. Musicans, singers and artists spend thousands of hours practising and perfecting their sound, honing in on there craft. people who sing opera music cannot rely upon pitch correcting software to achieve a pitch perfect voice, that takes time and dedication. so maybe i could see the trend of augmenting vocals as upsetting to those who practice performing in their natural voice. Because maybe they feel like it discounts their efforts. why practise and try at all if anyone realistically can manufacture a perfect vocal with the right tools?   but what isnt fair in this whole situation is T-Pain being the scapegoat. without realizing, T-Pain bacme an ambassoser for Auto-Tune, and for how modern artists today use autotune today to completely augment and mask there voice. like to a whole new different extent. that just isnt really fair. T-Pain despite being known for his extensive auto tune usage. has a lovely natural voice. T-Pain is a musican, he knows how to play the guitar and piano, and hearing him perform in a live setting proves he can absolutely sing without needing auto tune at all. T-Pain was never at any point hiding his voice in auto tune, He was using it stylistially in his music, he liked how it sounded, so he put himself out there. T-Pain absolutely doesnt deserve any scorn for "ruining the music industry" if you think he does, do some actual research. hes an artist. im sorry that happened to him.
Usher is just mad that all he is known for now is herpes!
T-pain deserves a better friend
Your voice is an instrument, and like any instrument, it has things to either help it sound a certain way or perform better if needed such as auto tune. It would have been invented as some point anyway
The 3rd silver play button with no uploads is one of the biggest flex’s I’ve ever seen…
have yall seen him on the masked singer he was literally perfect 😤😤😤😤
D’Angelo slaps
T-pain deserved so much better,I hope he knows that
If people were going to care about this, why now and not like... Fifteen years ago?
Canceled for not being a coffee person.
He got shit on badly for doing something that everyone ended up doing afterwards. He’s not even the first to use that sort of effect on his voice!!. Funkytown by Lips Incc used vocoders to get that similar sound and that was 1980. It sucks that he got done so dirty for simply making pure fun music that EVERYONE DANCED TO. And he’s genuinely an awesome dude, his twitch streams are fun and he does a lot of great community work. Everyone should apologize to T-Pain. Thanks for the vid, he deserves someone defending him.
New Tools: *Exist* Some people: Oh no no no no you can use that it'll ruin all of [enter field]
ppl who think autotune ruins music clearly have never experienced the hyperpop brain scratch and i just realized it wouldnt be such an important feature of hyperpop without t-pain making it such a staple of pop music. stan tpain for clear skin
THANK YOU. T-PAIN DOES NOT DESERVE THE HATE. Usher must be dumb if he doesn't know that Autotune is used by so many people in the music industry and it is unjust and unwarranted to blame someone for something like that.
commenting for the algorithm
JACOB COLLIER IS NOT HUMAN i've seen him live and i've never seen such raw talent in my LIFE
I'm really glad you mentioned the Masked Singer thing, because I thought that would have ended the discussion on this, but I guess not :/
I looooooove t-pain ❤️ his voice is smoooth
Imagine waking someone up on a flight to argue about using a tool to enhance your voice for songs lmao what the fuck Usher
im sorry dream stans, but 12:40 is me @ mask by dream😭
I rather chew both of my arms off than to agree with people who don't have any taste in good music! WE WILL NOT DO ANY T PAIN SLANDER IN THE YEAR 2021 OR EVER!!!
I like how D’Angelo covers the real important topics.
T-Pain is a legend man. He's had so many hits,is mad influential, and he's just an awesome person. I like Usher too but he, and everyone mindlessly agreeing with him, couldn't be more WRONG. T-pain's sound was influential because he's SUPER TALENTED. If he's so awful and "ruined music" in some way then why did SO MANY other artists try to emulate his sound in one form or another? The whole premise of the argument is ridiculous. T-Pain is 🐐💯
your looks are so powerful. i want to steal them. where did you get this hoodie?
Cancel culture needs to just stop
This is beyond stupid
This video is p r i s t i n e
T-Pain has a medley of his songs where he genuinely sings...and omg, it is beautiful. The man can _croon._
im just going to say it it’s always twitter that starts unnecessary drama smh 🤦🏾‍♀️
literally some of the greatest r&b and soul singers of all time used vocoder affects on their voice for stylistic reasons t.pain just did the 21st century version of that
Not Usher talking like he's the pinnacle of music 😭
You should make us a playlist
Usher needs to stop acting like a boomer
you pronounce your g’s just like Ethan hahaha it’s great
I didn't expect the jacob collier shoutout the public needs more of this man he's an absolute menace of a musician
Tpain is such a legend dude, he drives the coolest cars too. Dude made a pickle rick s15
can you turn on subtitles pls?
I’d never heard of T-Pain until The Masked Singer. His voice is amazing. He can sing
Autotune would have blown up even without T Pain.
Idk the idea the music became more accessible to average sounding people isn't bad. It's like a rich person getting mad more people are getting rich
TPain has the longevity. Usher is so irrelevant and gross now
Twitter be crazy.
This is a comprehensive contemporary music class
T pain was memorable. His songs were catchy and the autotune was new and created a different vibe. If you don’t like it, Usher, just don’t use it lol. Don’t hate on T pain just for being a popular artist. Auto tune is a tool for style or aiding the pitch, if you don’t like it, just don’t use it.
Adore this love letter to T-Pain. He seems the sweetest. Also T-Pain slaps IDGAF. Like SOPHIE was often considered the future of music before she died and her voice was often computerized sounding so idk what Usher is talking about. Expand your horizons sir. 😌❤️
another flawless video 👑 love the direction ur taking this channel and im so excited about the new one!
I've never really thought about t pain more than hearing a song on the radio until he was on the gus and eddy podcast where he was incredibly wholesome
D’Angelo blessing us with the Roger & Zapp tho! Okay young man, I see you…  “Slow & easy is the way I wanna love you tonight…slow & easyyyyy, aw yeah…”  RIP to a funk and R&B legend, Roger Troutman. His music still slaps today.
D’Angelo Wallace is the T-Pain of commentary
It says alot about Usher that he would bother another person just to insult them.
Check out T-Pain's song GET UP. So inspiring, it's my alarm song.
Usher's a jerk and T pain is a hilarious talented dude.
🤨🤨 what come on now usher
is anyone else wondering about d'angelo's thoughts on the creepshow art/lolcow/emily artful situation? obviously he doesn't have to comment on it if he doesn't want to, but I was just curious about his thoughts on it since he was one of the people shannon singled out and talked trash about on lolcow.
t pain a talented singer songwriter vocalist and person. in conclusion i will be blasting t pain on my stereo from now on
You make me love YouTube again because this is the discourse I need to see, not the self indulgent anger-hype that's on Twitter. I have an account solely to fact check time to time the YouTube videos where I get the information, then write my own opinion on reddit and/or medium.
You need to make a video on Britney #FreeBritney
i am so fucking tired of twitter brainrot
T-pain can sing ushers ass under the table!!! His voice is angelic without auto tune and his sound is original that many have tried and failed miserably to copy! Fuck ushers irrelevant ass!
It’s sad because he really doesn’t deserve all the hate he’s getting rn
Next we’re gonna cancel the ducking sun for being warm
DONT COME AFTER MY KING T-PAIN!!!!!! Also, the argument that you cannot say anything if you released Bi*ber to the world, is valid and I am not sorry.
it’s so weird to even see vocals referred to as the most important part of a song as someone who listens to mostly electronic music. autotune is a super cool tool, and so can other vocal effects!
People act like if it wasn't for T-pain nobody would be using autotune... like its a useful technology that can make music production quicker/easier, it becoming popular was inevitable. I hate the big studios that overuse autotune as much as anyone, but these are big corporations who are always looking for a way to make music production cheaper, of course they were gonna find out about autotune and start using it. Even if T-pain didn't exist, as autotune grew there was eventually going to be a popular artist who used it and helped increase it's prevalence. Tbh pitch correction and the like has existed for a long time, all T-pain really did was make autotune common knowledge since his voice was modified enough to make it obvious to everyone.
I have adored T-Pain for many years, he is adorable on twitch. Hes got a kind soul and an open heart. Ushers lyrics literally offended me when I was 12 and they offend me now.
chills everytime he sings live AND sings with autotune 💕
Hey D'Angelo! I was wondering if you accepted fan art, I made some for you while playing this video!! <3
it gives me the same kind of vibes as traditional artists who hate on people who do digital art because it’s “easier”. it still requires some degree of talent, it just adds a certain type of flair to the art. people forget that music and singing is a form of art and expression. if someone chooses to use auto tune as a way to enhance their art then i think that’s justified.
Usher said that to him because he was one of the losers who weren't on a boat.
Thank you for covering this, vocoders have been used since at least the eighties. My community college used them.  Autotune was invented for one reason, then blew up in popularity because of Cher. I've never cared for the aesthetic, but that's what it is. *An aesthetic*. Did purple ruin color? Nah.  Lavender did :D  Usher is so in the wrong it's disgusting. Reminds me of early nineties conversations in classical music school, "is rap music?"  Lastly, tpain with Andy Sandburg On A Boat is genius.
"all music these days is terrible!1! this is the downfall of good music!" tell me you just listen to whatever random sounds happen to be playing in the air and don't look for music you actually like without telling me
Voices with electronic effects sound mostly constipated and uncomfortable to me (with a few exceptions.)
i mean… the guitar analogy is good bc effect pedals exist
tbh his story is sad especially because usher was his friend. ive definitely had someone i felt a close friend do something similar. literally laughed in my face about it lol but its just so hard to feel bad about him (especially when you say it cause we love you here king) but after finding all the problematic stuff he did that was genuinely just ugly and about women being assaulted i just truly cant feel bad for him for this but i can definitely relate
The bit about acoustic vs electric guitar is kinda funny because people were so mad at Bob Dylan for switching to electric
Oh ho ho. I see that merch!
I view auto-tune as more as a instrument sometimes .
I was one of those people that said T pain ruined music when he was popping off awhile ago. But now I got older and I learned to appreciate creative and popular stuffs.
9:19 Something that I've always found strange is that a lot of the R&B and Latin-pop folks RAN to dance music in the late '00s/early '10s. It was kind of unreal. Never in a million years did I expect to hear Usher or Ne-Yo on a dance/pop/EDM track, but like...  At least they were bangers?!
He's not the only one using.... auto-tune...
i wonder how usher would feel about vocaloid
T Pain is an artist who used auto tune the way Roger and Zapp used voice modulation.  T Pain didn’t use auto tune to auto correct his voice-like every other artist has and had before t pain.  Usher was just being jealous.  (I wrote this before you were finished).
I hate it when people try to dictate what’s valid and what isn’t valid when it comes to self expression through music. Music is meant to be enjoyed at least by the person making it, there’s no such thing as “ruining music” because the thing that makes music great is that everything works. If you don’t like that’s popular just enjoy what you like in peace and stop bitching to others about what they like. I’m so tired of the whole discourse around autotune because people can’t seem to realize that it’s a stylistic choice, songs with auto tune aren’t meant to be about vocals or rap tone, they’re meant to be about the sound that autotune as a stylistic production tool brings to the song. If you don’t like it, that’s okay, go find things you do like, let us enjoy what we like and leave the singers alone! It’s also like it completely disregards the importance of the non vocal elements in songs like dude, expand your horizons, there’s so much more to music than the vocals.
Wait til people find out about Vocaloid
People who cancel people over this stupid shit and literally dont care about people who have a following and actually deserve jail time are so fucking idiotic they shouldn't be allowed the right to go outside until they've gained some level of intelligence tbh
Usher is fr going to hell in a handbasket, how do you wake somebody up just to tell them that they ruined music? Where do you get the energy for that?? That man is seriously evil.
Uncle Teeps is amazing and doesn’t deserve any hate.
The same fear happened when drum machines were introduced, it didn't cancel drummers.  They're new tools and they make music more accessible, which makes more voices heard. Between this and the Usher-bucks rumor, it's not a good year for Usher's PR.
okay also CAN I JUST SAY nobody sounds QUITE as good with autotune as t pain, like it’s insane - his voice was literally built to complement it, like the timbre is so fucking perfect for it. i literally cannot think of a single person who makes autotune sound THAT good.
People were using auto tune wayyyyyyy before T Pain came on the scene…so to sit here and act like T Pain was the one to introduce auto tune to the music industry is ridiculous!! Usher was just mad that he had become old and irrelevant due to his OWN CHOICE to take a 4yr hiatus and needed someone to blame that he wasn’t poppin anymore. PERIOD. Bc T Pain can sangggg amazingly WITHOUT THE AUTOTUNE and that’s been proven time and time again…so ppl need to stop acting like he only was famous bc he used auto tune. He only used auto tune to establish a VIBE which he did and why everyone started to use it more heavily afterwards. Period. Usher was and continues to be corny and lame. It’s just a shame he had to take out T Pains career out with his own😤 Usher should shut the entire fuck up Frfr and go back to feeling on -whoops I mean establishing, little white boys bc that’s obviously all he’s capable of anymore. This shit made me sick. I feel so BAD for T Pain😢 he deserves ALL THE FLOWERS💐💐💐
never heard a t-pain song in my life but his voice is beautiful with or without autotune
T-Pain could most definitely sing circles, squares, and triangles around Usher sooooo
T-Pain has done nothing wrong. Like his music is EVERYTHING. That was my jam growing up and always will be. BUY U A DRANK?!?? Like come on guys :( he’s got an amazing voice, auto-tune or not. Stop hating and canceling the guy over absolutely nothing. Because everyone uses auto-tune these days  WAIT HAHAHA I HAD TO REWIND. DID YOU REALLY SAY ‘I don’t care if I’m in danger, let me find out’
I hurt from every song he plays...the copyrights..
Music is an art form. It changes, grows, and evolves. If one type of music doesn’t do it for you, there are tons of songs and genres to choose from. And honestly, no one person can ruin music. If one person had that power, music would have died centuries ago. People accused Chopin, jazz, rap, rock, and hip hop of ruining music. It’s not ruined. The stuff you like is still thriving and available. There just happens to be this new thing along with the older stuff.
I AM HERE FOR THE JACOB COLLIER LOVE
Travis Scott falling in auto-tune perhaps never would have happened. And that's a shame.
T-Pain is a much kinder person than me because if Usher woke me up just to tell me that, I'd rock his shit
don’t people have better things to do
Cher: am I a joke to you??
Uproot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture by Jace Clayton has a great chapter titled, “Auto-Tune Gives You a Better Me.”  It talks about the move from corrective to cosmetic auto-tune, and about its spread to North Africa. Auto-tune is the great equalizer for a lot of music producers, and has become an instrument in its own right.
So nobody gonna comment the fact that 13:47 is actually "Save Your Tears" by The Weeknd & Ariana Grande?
PSA: It's pronounced "ess-press-oh" rather than "ex-press-oh."
Really? Crying about autotune? This is peak "Oh my god, who the hell cares?"
Ooo the merch looks amazing king❤️
Me watching the red ball go over the all the ads and not playing them: 👁👄👁
I’m glad T-Pain won Masked Singer to prove the haters wrong. 🤷🏻‍♀️
D’Angelo just be out here PREACHING 🙌🏻
Usher is mad because T Pain still slaps but he quickly became corny 🙄🤣
Twitter is a gaslighting home for teens, adults, and children to get at others for anything, literally anything. It's a cesspool for hypocrites, and band wagon hoppers. But this is what we live in, this specific day and age and only we care and ppl like us. And there's nothing that we can do bc people hop and hop to whatever the biggest trend is no matter if it's ruining someone's success or making them feel insecure and depressed. Goodnight.
People make trash music without auto tune on regular basis. T Pain held a whole decade down. Yall better give him his respect.
so glad you gave a shoutout to jacob collier!!!  the man is so talented and deserves every bit of *being halted in his path of destruction before he consumes us all*
OMG T-Pain! I know him! He's amazing! Thank you for loving him too!
That hoodie is fire. Where's it from?
Here's a list of my favorite modern R&B artists.  - Giveon - Ella Mai - Daniel Ceaser - H.E.R. - Rod Wave - Jhene Aiko - PJ Morton - Thundercat - Miguel - Jorja Smith (Blue Lights is a masterpiece) - Tinashe - Anderson .Paak  Name me more in the replies!
People who hate on autotune are the same ones who tell you to “name one song” when you’re wearing a band tee.
Shamir ❤️
I really hope Usher has apologized to T-pain. 4 years of depression from a friends comment about your career and love for music, I cant even imagine. Words have weight. Kindness is free.
THIS MAN MADE IM SPRUNG! Usher have a tall glass of stfu and sit down.
I hope T-Pain watches this video!
great video!! anyone know the music in the background, i’ve been wondering for like 2 days 😓
Not the catchy song immediately getting stuck in my head and I’ve never seen the movie 🙃
what happened to usher? this is the first time ive heard of him in like months??!!
We watch the season that he was on masked singer and were blow away by that voice. TPain is a phenomenon to be reckoned with and usher had NO RIGHT.
T pains & his wife's twitch and YT has hella gems 💎💎💎 genuine asf
Usher is like walmart brand Jason Derulo while Jason somehow, simultanously also hapens to be walmart brand Usher, its... Symbiotic
Oh my God some people really need to log off twitter lmao
Wait until people realise autotune is used on literally every song from the last 20 years just not cranked up obviously like T Pain or Kanye did
I will not allow TPain slander in my life. Talent. Love him ❣️
Isn't cancelling T-Pain for using autotune like cancelling 2 Chainz for using chains? Like cancelling Muhammed Ali for using boxing gloves? Like cancelling Nelson Muntz for using "HEH HEH" ?
people really need ANYTHING to be mad at every ten minutes.
I can't wait for the new hoodie!! it looks so good D'angelo
where did you get that hoodie, I NEED IT
This is bullshit, T-Pain is a legend and his influence is undeniable even in this egregious hatred. Usher is clearly just jealous.
People: Autotune is bad! Those same people: * Listening to Daft Punk like it isn't also autotune *  ((Daft Punk is great btw))
i really dont think these mfers know what autotune is lol
RnB dooo be vibing right now, for reaAAL
The use of autotune does not make you 'untalented' and music that has autotune or added effects does not make it bad. Stop hating on artists who use autotune please
Auto-tune is one of *many* musical instruments, all of which have never hurt someone. Let T-Pain create how he wants. My favorite kind of music sounds like it's from a fantasy world with the fluttering of Auto-Tune's wings throughout.
theres a really good video by sideways called the problem with autotune that goes over how autotune is everywhere
personally don't like autotune. never have really, if it is used at all I'd prefer it to be used sparingly, or it be used well. but that's how I'D prefer it. the whole point of art is that it's subjective. like with any art form and tool used in it, it CAN be used well. it makes me sad to see T-Pain be made to feel this way for basically being experimental in his art :(
My oh my. T-pain can already sing, and growing up as a kid that's literally what he based his career off of. As he said in an interview, it's not bc he couldn't, but that's what ppl wanted and was attracted to. That's the main reason why he used it. So this generation is so damn stupid like this makes no sense at all. Wake up ppl.
Usher being all high and mighty about auto tune kills me. He literally "pays" strippers with usherbucks that have his face on them. Imagine being so pathetic and still trying to bring down T Pain
Can I just say..... Your content is immaculate 💜💜💜 seriously one of my favorite YouTubers 💜💜💜🥺
What fucks me up is that Usher said "you fucked up music for real singers", when t-pain can actually sing, phenomenally. Autotune doesn't 'fix' a voice, it's a stylistic choice and an enhancement tool, and it's so shitty that people dont realize this.
If T-pain ruined R&B   Then Pink Floyd ruined Rock for adding machines for drums and other sound effects. Kurt Cobain ruined music for using simple power chords.  Ozzy Osborn ruined music for using tuned down instruments.  Sugar hill gang ruined music by rapping over a looped machine beat.  Drake and Kanye ruined rap by not being gangsters.  And Kid Cudi ruined Rap by addicting psychedelics and humming.
omg were half of these twitter dumdums even alive when tpain was super popular? i remember in highschool everyone freaked out over the tpain autotune iphone app.
T pain needs to see this
I love your videos.  Thanks. <3
😲 what?! Legit all of the hits that had auto tune were ICONIC!! Pleases leave this talented man alone.
Drop the merch like rn, this isn’t a question
I’m paused at 20:59 to listen to Buy U A Drank
Love T-Pain!💯💯🔥
Finally got good headphones so now I can fully appreciate D'angelo's voice.
you popped tf off in this vid bruh it was so informative and entertaining, I love T-Pain
When this first hit on Netflix and T Pain stated what Usher said. I was like really Usher you've used Auto Tunes yourself. You just made T Pain took the game and has ran with it. I'm 48 years old and for sure have listener to T Pain with having younger children at the time. The man has talent!
Usher need to stfu. We gotta protect t-pain at ALL costs. Unproblematic TALENTED king!!!
always feels so weird to be early on ur videos
“How is she a real person?” Me, every time I hear Tatiana from Jinjer.
On another note, if T Pain didn’t popularize autotune, we never would have gotten so many good memories from music and creations with autotune. I know I can’t live without animals on autotune
guys dangelo said poggers
L M F A OOOOOO people do NOT need to be coming for T Pain for auto tune when they listen to artists like Lil Baby. Boi sounds like T Pains auto tune mixer said “fuck it this’ll do!!!”
“Some of y’all have got to stop blaming auto tune for ruining music, and just get better at finding music”   Exactly there are so many amazing underrated artists out there but all y’all want to hear is mumble rappers and over played mainstream music.
I have not seen that clip of Chloe singing low before that shook me to my core 😳 I knew she has range but damn
dude auto tone can be used to make sound that nothing else really can and make such interesting sound when used right. people need to stop downing on auto tune so much
T Pain is amazing! He's extremely knowledge particularly around technology, Usher is just mad that he was on the bleeding edge.
Plot twist the channel is litreally to see how many people would subscribe to a channel with no posts🙃, but in regrads to video people espically Usher needs to realise the main reason as to why the R&B scene is becoming shit is because you got these new artists with lyrics that does not make any sense or sound very copy and paste or they just not at the same standard vocal wise when it comes to artists from his generation, its got nothing to do with autotune as theres only so much it can do and even then you still need techno knowledge and experience in order to apply that like it should not be looked down on and his hypercritcal for Usher to make that statment when he's used autotune so many times before maybe not the point its noticable like T-Pain but he's still used it to some extent to make the final recoreded songs sound cleaner like he should not be coming after anyone that uses it 🙄🙄
The camera quality is better then my actual eyesight 😂
But we all knew it wasn’t his real voice and he was using autotune. And I was a kid. We all simultaneously liked him and people who didn’t use autotune. He has an amazing voice without autotune too. He was doing what artists do to make it. They make changes, they do some different shit. If not he would’ve sounded like everyone else and probably wouldn’t have hit. Usher was past his musical prime by this time. He was mad he wasn’t selling like he used to and found someone to take it out on. And T didn’t invent autotune. These ppl ignorant.
never have been this early LMAO
Usher is known as a self absorbed narcissist, so him saying that is no surprise… That said, Yeah! is still a banger
this is why I don't have Twitter
Listen to his tiny desk concert and say he's not a talented singer...
Oh, I didn't realize we get to tell artists how to make THEIR OWN ART. Like stopppp. He's hurting no one.
10:57 okay come thru 100gecs
I didn't think in 2021 people would still be arguing about this
Twitter has cancelled for less
The bar thing only applies to the states lol rip
i mean there's a reason why the song low is timeless and incredible
IMMA BUY YOU A DRANK OOOOOOOOWWWWWEEEUUU. IMMA TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME! I GOT MONEY IN THE BAYYYYYAAANK
Once more  Twitter: 0  D'Angelo: Untouchably god
I just want to give the man a hug. Every singer uses autotune, T Pain just popularized it. Not his problem that other artists use it. Fuck Usher for treating it like T Pain is behind anything negative
In the words of Sideways, T-Pain has to do endless acoustic performances, tiny desk concerts, stints on The Masked Singer, etc. just to prove he can actually sing but no one questions the talent of Daft Punk after using the same damn tools.
do they not realize that a shit ton of popular celebs use auto tune?
You always have a sponsor. Get that coin.
"if you take a step back and look at the male R&B scene before and after T-Pain, the drop off is significant" have you heard of frank ocean ??
The fact that u just said bad bunny has me😭😭
This man is the backbone of the music industry. Music genres would not have been unique without him alot of artists wouldn't have been discovered either
T-Pain wrote a song about Animal Crossing that slaps.  Everyone who thinks the man is a disgrace to music can just walk out the door.  He's got his own style, just like any singer/songwriter/musician.  Just because someone doesn't like his style doesn't mean he's "ruined music".
never RELEASED music.
It just hit me what D's new channel is gonna be lol. I'm like "where's all this musical knowledge coming from?" then my eyes focused in on that keyboard.
AYO WHAT???? Imagine canceling T-Pain for doing something that he has been doing for years.
🎵I'm Sprung  For DAngelo 👀👀👅
omg love how you mentioned shamir
1. You're wearing all of my favorite colors 2. I've been saying this shit for _years_ 100% agree with everything you say in this video 3. Autotune definitely slaps if I like the rest of the song and the lyrics. Perfect example: Ritt Momney's _(If) The Book Doesn't Sell_ is one of my favorite songs.
He has never told anyone to use auto-tune. People saw him singing and succeeding and they wanted to hop on the train. Twitter people calling him a baby or that he was over-reacting, imagine a friend saying something negative about something you are so passionate about. I don't know about twitter fools, but that sure would hurt.
Cancel Usher! wtf we don't stan terrible friends I want to hug this man forever
usher is still relevant? props, I guess
We love Tpain
I thought Cher was the first one to use auto tune in music? Or Britney too?
Imagine being the Usher who found guy that makes Yummy songer.
So, in short, apparently there’s a wrong in music? Music is something to express yourself with. Autotuned or not, music’s-music, there’s no screwing that up 😑
WE. STAN. T-PAIN. Seriously, his music inspired so many modern genres, and his auto tune is only a small part of it.
I'll be back to watch this later
Everything I've seen of T-Pain has been amazing, I can't imagine approaching anyone for such a thing, let alone T-PAIN who is supposedly your FRIEND to tell him you think he ruined an entire industry... Even if it was true, which it absolutely isn't, I do not see the point in that confrontation, nor the need the defend it.
"Jacob Collier needs to be stopped" is my favorite part of the video XD
Where’s usher now? The last I heard of him he was in scary movie so I think T Pain is winning
T-Pain also SLAYS at COD. I love that clip of him destroying a racist ass team who kept calling him the n word. He absolutely decimated them singlehanded.
imagine crying about your career and blaming it on another nigga bcuz he brought a new sound and people copycat. Tpain is Fing Legend still relevant to today.
He looks so genuinely sad when the interviewer brought up usher...my heart broke for him. 🥺 People are horribly mean.
Usher is just a jealous hater
instead of adapting to the ever-changing music trend, usher blames t-pain cause he can't reach his level. smh
Ok but like does my man ever lie
And Usher is an asshole 😒
we should also cancel danny phantom for not becoming a ghost the old fasiond way.
damn hearing usher say that t pain ruined music kinda hurt my soul ngl
usher was sooo bitter lol
usher was sooo bitter lol
I mean Lil Wayne kind of rocks
I haven't watched the video yet but as an ancient being who was around for the rise of T-Pain on the charts... wasn't using auto-tune his thing??? Idk why people are getting mad at him using auto-tune when he's been doing this since the beginning. 😭
T-Pain made middle and high school dancers better.
“I can put you in a log cabin, somewhere in Aspen.” “Cause you look so goooood, you make me wanna spent it all on ya.” Lol how dare Usher
buck wild that people STILL don’t know that T-Pain is an incredible singer without autotune... like he’s sang publicly without it so many times now it should be common knowledge????  ESPECIALLY buck wild in the era of autocrooning being so ubiquitous, like how tf are you gonna hate t-pain and love juice wrld or young thug? tf???
I feel so bad. Pain deserves better.
personally not into auto tune music but obviously many people love it and t pain has been very successful from it!! i support him.
Let these niggas knowwwwww
I think auto-tune has given many people a chance to become famous. And although they may not have the greatest voice, they felt like they had something to say. Like X, Lil Peep, and Juice Wrld, they didn't have the most angelic voices, but damn did they have something to say, and people listened. And I think that's the whole point of music tbh.
I REALLY HOPE T-PAIN SEES THIS HE’S A WHOLESOME GUY AND HE NEEDS TO SEE US SUPPORTING HIM!! boys support boys!!!!
T Pain is too talented to be treated like this
Damn where can I get that hoodie
Vocoloid just died I think
We all know that he uses auto tune. How can you cancel someone for something they aren't trying to hide. I'm so sick of cancel culture
I am an engineer and think it is so funny that he is explicitly using auto-tune. Almost every single top song that hits the top 200 charts on anything has auto-tune. Auto-tune is the best thing that has happened. Cher used it and I didn't hear anybody saying that she had ruined music. I am very tired of hearing that t-pain ruined music and that auto-tune ruined music. Most people can't tell the difference. I hope people learn that they need to that it is part of the process. Auto-tune gives music the mixing sound that we love today. That's why people sometimes don't sound as good live as they do recorded. Most people's voices aren't tuned exactly to A=440hz. We are human, we are not perfect. Also people can naturally sound like they have auto-tune before the plug-in is even applied to the vocal chain, which is something that  you can listen for live.
D’angelo being a Willow and Giveon stan is just what i needed today 😌
bad r&b definitely doesn't cancel our good r&b like frank ocean? the internet? liv.e? the weeknd? steve lacy? matt martians? i can go on and on and as someone that grew up around that sound like r&b and rap. that person is definitely wrong lmao
T-PAIN IS A1 SINCE DAY1 💯
Auto tune started the demise of quality in popular music, it was the beginning of music without musicians, now anyone is an “artist” with the right producer.
We’re still talking about T Pain and auto tune? Is it 2008? People need to leave T Pain alone, he seems like a nice dude. And I don’t care what anyone says, Buy U a Drank is still a banger.
it sucks so much because tpain is such a good singer even without autotune
This made me feel like a b*tch for ever judging musicians for using autotune... and yknow, I deserve that. Gonna step back from that terrible point of view going forward for sure, for sure.
Usher is human trash. T Pain is a legend.
Buy you a drank! T pain IS  2010s. Legend.
Ok I Don't Think T Pain Ruined Music but Usher did Create the Song Revenge Parodied. Sooooo
Music genre popularity changes every couple of years, styles tend to come back around. Just because T-Pain started near the end of a wave, it doesn't invalidate the people who enjoy that type of music...I don't understand why people are blaming him, correlation is not always causation.
As a musician I'm ashamed to say that I was anti autotune when T Pain first came out. Over time I definitely appreciate him more as a musician and a vocalist. Also T Pain did not popularize pitch correction in music. It was used before him so if you're gonna blame anybody it's not T Pain.
Does anyone want D’Angelo to make a playlist on Spotify of all his favorite songs because he has some good taste
Y'all, auto tune can only do so much, you still need to have a good voice for the auto tune to sound good
tpain defense squad always
t-pain and d'angelo collab when
First I saw the tweet about him saying he got depressed bc Usher was mean to him. And then I felt bad for him. And then I saw he said some weird shit, like he would kill his gf if she cheated on him. And that’s bad but it was also worded in a disturbing way. And then I didn’t feel as bad for him
Sideways is raising his fist to the sky in joy right now.
T pain is such a cool guy. Leave him alone for real.
I don’t know how much T-pain changed music but he’s on my daily drive playlist still and Ushers not so there’s that.
I LOVED hearing him on 6lack’s album. Total surprise and it made me so happy
Gen Z will cancel anyone expect the kardashians and jenners, the ones who should be cancelled.
in addition to this video, id suggest u guys watch SIDEWAYS youtube video about auto tune if you want to learn more about auto tune usage/people being mad at t pain for nothing
I LOVE t pain and he is actually an amazing singer. he MADE auto tune, he had such a huge impact on music. it sucks he's getting hate.
twitter (derogatory)
Usher has always seemed like a douche.
Ushers washed now. He shouldn't be talking shit after pulling that usherbucks bull shit
1) The most important thing about music is that it sounds good, just like the most important things about food are that it's sustaining and tastes good. At least, in my opinion.   2) What's ironic is that you just KNOW the same people saying T-Pain "ruined" popular music/R&B and ruined music on the radio are the same people who are proud of not listening to popular music. No matter how the music on the radio sounds these people take pride in only listening to "indie" and "underground" artists and tracks and will gatekeep anyone trying to listen to what they listen to. You can't have it both ways. You can't say "music on the radio is trash and you have trash taste for listening to it" and also GATEKEEP people from less popular music.
Usher is sounding a little narcissistic on this one. Guy should have talked to a therapist before T-Pain. YIKES
Auto-tune is a vastly capable instrument that can be used to ENHANCE the already talented voices of singers, it’s purpose is to compliment and and expand what the natural human can do, which should be considered badass in of itself.
I did feel bad for TPain when he was telling that story. You could tell his feelings were hurt. I don't like autotune but I hope he's been able to get past Usher's comment & realize his worth as an artist ❤
Isn't this old news though..?
YouTube do not want me watching dangelo videos the only reason I saw this was because it was on my home page I didn’t even get a nonfiction even tho I subscribe and I have nonfiction on
I paused at 0:02 to go do something so all I heard was *angrily* "People on twitter..." *beleaguered pause* and honestly, that's all I needed, so thanks D'Angelo.
T-Pain radiates such good energy man. Charlie a few months back played some fps, it was a chill stream and he wasn't having fun. Then T-Pain played with him and man I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Love the guy, doesn't deserve that hate
My favorite part of the TP episode was how he spoke about his wife. Just such respect.
what
Oh Absolutely not!! TPain will NEVER be cancelled!! My mom is 72 in a nursing home and has Dementia and whenever we sing (she was a singer) The only song she can remember is "Im in love with a stripper" it is funny cuz it was funny back in the day when she would sing it but its kinda sad too....But i love Tpain!!!!!!
This is a pretty good vid but I kinda zoned out for a small sec and that kinda confused me for the whole rest of the vid ;-;  Still this video is amazing and I agree with everything D’Angelo said, even if I did zone out for 10 seconds in the middle of the vid
I’ve been listening to T-pain since I was little with my sister. So many good memories😩
Like?? Is digital art not real art? If it’s not, then looks like we gotta throw out our tablets, if only traditional is acceptable
why does everybody hate auto-tune so much its dumb. like they’re making music for your ears to hear thats all that matters
T-Pain also just seems like a sweetie, so usher and twitter needs to leave him alone
Listen. I don’t like the sound of auto tune. As a kpop fan I was disappointed when dynamite was released. But come on guys. It’s just a different sound. It doesn’t ruin music. Just suck it up and don’t listen
I think that the worst thing about autotune is live perfomances. Not so many singers or rappers can sound as good live as they do on a recorded song, but this is a part of a bigger issue which is artist not giving a fuck about quality of their concerts. Stuff like playing a whole song with a playback while singing/rapping half of it is really annoying to me. That's also propably the reason why live albums are a rarity nowadays, since not that many artist are willing to do a more raw performance.
Are yall serious? Canceling T-Pain?????
Didn't Sideways make a video about something like this? Something about auto-tune and pitch correction it's really good watch it
If you guys wanna hear the whole issue about the problem with autotune, I highly recommend watching Sideways’s video about the subject matter. Props to him also for defending T-Pain in that video.
You and Courtreezy should make a video together
“people” on Twitter...
D’Angelos playlist is probably so good and he’s not sharing it
D'Angelo being done with everyone on the internet day 3485
what’s that fka twigs performance at 13:17 called?
It really hurt to hear when he explained singing without auto tune in front of people and he couldn’t even look into the crowd without his  anxiety overwhelming him
Oh dope, who were those two small artists? Sounded pretty good.
my guy tylenol painrelief does not deserve the hate that he is getting >:(  in all seriousness, he is insanely talented and this whole thing is so stupid, like, just let the man make music the way he wants to. music is a form of self-expression and people should not be bringing others down just because they don't agree with something. his music is actually really good in my opinion :D
Usher is just jealous
If those who are “cancelling” t-pain watch “this is pop” on Netflix they would see he wasn’t the first one to use auto-tune and he was ridiculed for it UNTIL Kanye and lil Wayne dabbled into it. Then it became over saturated.
I particularly like the auto tune cover on tiktok (which I’m sure everyone’s heard), “And here it is, our final night alive...”
I’m 31. I was a teenager when T Pain was really really big. T Pain is awesome, auto tune and all! I need you zoomers to stop, please, I’m begging you.
Sometimes- no most of the time, people on the internet are stupid. And as annoying as that is, that's the way it is. Hopefully, it'll change someday.
T-Pain showed his vulnerability in the Netflix special and is finally coming to terms to his depression of 4 years. Let him live.
the little poses you did when describing what makes a voice sound good got me. great video as always!
No one can match TPains talent... I mean c'mon, he fucked a mermaid!
God damn! Leave it to D'Angelo to change my mind. I mean at first I agreed kids gloves off autotune sucks. But I left  thinking I'm wrong autotune is just a different type of music that I may not like but dosnt mean it ruined anything.
I used to work at Legoland and was tortured endlessly by all of the catchy songs in The Lego movie and because of that I am incredibly offended and triggered by T-Pain's contribution to that
Tbh he doesn’t need auto tune I’ve heard him sing without it and he sounds perfectly fine and at this point cancel culture isn’t even real if he’s already benefit off of the autotune if they had such a problem with it they should’ve canceled him when his career started (not saying I want him canceled I love his music)
15:14 || *BÆJ HËÊŠ* ||
Thank you for coming to his defense. I felt the same way. The way it made TPain feel was the worst part.
T-Pain x Girlfriend Reviews on the E3 2021 review, and now D is giving my man his due props? Today is a good day.
if we cancelled an artist every time they used autotune,, half the industry would be gone
D'Angelo: mentions playbuton JackSucksAtLife veiwers: floods coment section twiter and even redit of both creators(like I am contributing to now).
Wasn’t Usher thowin Usherbucks at dancers a few months ago?
Imo Travis scott ruined auto tune. 💀
Petition to make T Pain a Disney princess
the people sending him hate haven't watched his npr tint desk concert and it shows
how can you hate t-pain hes like the nicist guy like 100% wholesome dude everyone gets along with
Agree
man how messed up you gotta be to say that to t-pain. like the disrespect usher's career probably wouldn't have made it without t-pain's impact on the music industry
now is a great time to remind yall that d'angelo can SINGGGG hes so good
Shawwwwdyyyyyyy
T-pain is everything. And seeing him hurt, hurt my cold dead heart in a way I never thought it could.
twitter </3
Mfs really never saw tpain absolutely murder “a change is gonna come” and it shows! One of the few covers of that song I can listen to and enjoy
Auto tune when done well sounds great.. t pain, charlie pooth(?), Cher just to name a few examples.. it's annoying that it gets such a bad reputation from overuse by mediocre/bad singers to make them sound tolerable 🙄🤦 Also, Usher of all people saying T pain ruined music - Usher wrote yeah.. one of the most annoying songs of all time. Fight me 😂
Im really glad you brought up the difference between post pitch correction and autotune. Also thinking of a good song and being able to sing are the same thing IMO, who cares about your physical ability, its the ideas mayne.
“Two small artists idk” I love this joke
PREACH KING 🙌🏼 FR THO BLESS U FOR SAYING SMTH
People soft asf
*Deep movie voice*   “In a world filled by idiots and Twitter fingers… opinions with no knowledge of how things actually work and no respect for anyone’s career and hard work, one man can defend them all using ETHOS, Pathos, And Logos… D’angelo Wallace, in: *Here is where you are wrong* “
Maybe Usher was having a bad day cuz that’s not it sis
T pain 😔💔
Did everyone just forget what a garbage person Usher is? lol Music aside..  Usher is garbage.
Can you put your new channel in your channel tab? It'll make it easier to find for new subscribers
T Pain is too precious to be hated on like this. Smfh.
You know how much of an ass you gotta be to wake someone up, no, have them woken up, brought to you, and go out of your way to give a shitty uneducated opinion? Yikes. That’s usher for ya.
T Pan didn't kill RnB with auto tune te reason why it went down was cause there was people trying to mimic what T pain did with Auto Tune alone and didn't even have the talent to match T Pain used it as an accessory/tool  more than him just singing and using Auto Tune as a main gimmick
"Two small artists idk" I agree.
All of this is stupid imo. Teddy Penderassdown has the vocals and that’s really what matters. It’d be different if he couldn’t sing. But he can.
T pain didn’t ruin music, he modified it.  You might not like auto tune but that doesn’t mean T pain erased other musicians who don’t use it.  If anything, he helped introduce auto tune to a lot of other musicians
Want to watch another great video about autotune that also mentions T-Pain? Check out Sideways' video called The Problem With Auto-Tune. It's incredibly eye-opening. Watch it here ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko
Idk who Usher thinks he is?! It kinda seems like he needed someone to blame for his decreased popularity since like 2000 or whenever. Also Mr Wallace, your locs are maturing beautifully!!  Edit: at least this situation is gonna get more people discovering the magic of Tpain
Only person getting cancelled is *USHER* !!! Nobody better come for the wholesome, vocal king T-pain. He’s a national treasure!
They might as well cancel every other artist too for using autotune
Yes! Autotune is a tool, it shouldn't matter whether people make use of the tool or not.
Neither D’Angelo Wallace, Dangelo Wallace, nor D’ANGELO WALLACE miss often. And he didn’t miss this time.
“two random small artists idk” LMAOOOO 😂😂😂😂
imagine walking someone up on a plane just to tell them "your music bad lol"
Auto tune+Tpain= masterpiece
Yo who are those two small artists, they sound nice.
Yall acting like T pain went and told artists to sell their souls to autotune...
Roger and Zapp didn't popularize the Talk-Box, they're just known for using it. I know that they didn't exactly popularize the original talk-box stuff since that happened super early but Stevie Wonder played Jackson 5 songs with it on National television and Pink Floyd had a billboard top 10 album with multiple songs with it and both of these occurred a good few years before Zapp's first use of it (Also if y'all haven't, check out the Stevie Wonder clip on it, it's lit) edit: Looked it up cause I was curious and apparently The Eagles, Aerosmith, and Steely Dan all had really popular songs with iconic talk-box sections too before Zapp even formed.
T-pain can actually sing. Autotune doesn’t magically make someone who can’t sing sound good. Auto-tune is more for effect and minor details. T-pain paved the way for so many artists and music in general
At the end of the day, he is still an artist.  your skin looks amazing BTW... just sayin
Just because you don’t like a specific type of music doesn’t mean it’s bad smh
The 64758th  times not knowing who he's talking about just clicked in to watch D'angelo
Ushers that friend that watches all your stories but doesn’t like your posts
T-Pain has proven he can sing beautifully with or without autotune. Even if that weren't the case, it wouldn't matter. Autotune is just one of many ways an artist can bring their vision to life. Some people aren't the best singers on their own, but their utilization of vocal editing like that helps bring great all around music to fruition (Grimes and Charli XCX for example benefit a lot from autotune, but their all around talent is undeniable). People who say autotune "ruined music" are just as bad and wrong as classic rock fans being like "electronic producers/rappers have no talent...they need to play real instruments". It's stupid.
the only sin that t pain committed is to rhymed mansion with Wisconsin.
Also, while yes it’s a cut throat and “honest” opinion…. R&B is ALWAYS thriving. It’s the one genre that HASNT gone down hill over the years.   Rock? Too aggressive or main stream.  Rap/Hip Hop? Too “mumble”, non-poetic.  Indie? Too experimental.   R&B STAYS true to its originality of the entire genre. It actually just evolves with the times, all other genres simply move forward and we are forced to accept it.
ITS 3 AM HERE IN BRITAIN I WAS ABOUT TO PUT DOWN MY PHONE AND SLEEP 😭
Frick them, T-Pain is a legend
whats the background music you use? it sounds like zelda
Usher Raymond the fifth🤨? Humble him King D’Angelo!
I was going to mention guitars. It's the same exact concept. Someone took a sound, altered it, people liked it, and so others did it.  Did I care as much for T-Pain? Not really. It wasn't for me. And that's fine. There was other stuff to listen to. And I have really liked a lot of the people you mentioned who have come out because of him. He had an idea based on things he had seen other artists do, so he did it. And he did it well.
Sound engineering is an art. Even in opera when nothing is really “altered” a sound engineer makes or breaks the recording. The balance and levels and all that it’s just AH.
WHY DOES THAT WILLOW SMITH SONG 𝔹𝕆ℙ   also wow that clip of FKA Twigs
It’s so sad cuz he had to cancel his tour cuz he couldn’t sell enough tickets :(  but I’ll never forget summer of I think 2019, at RBC bluesfest in Ottawa, he was playing and was put on the smallest stage. When he came out on stage, the crowd was FULL (literally you couldn’t find anywhere to sit) and chanting his name. he looked so emotional and he ran off stage 😭😭 you could tell it meant a lot to him. He doesn’t deserve this man
period stan willow
T-Pain started the auto-tune movement in R&B — but *he can still sing* like a MF _without_ it.  Conversely, most auto-tuners can’t sing for ish.
You say singing the same way as ethan from H3
T-pain’s autotune style inspired Kanye’s 808’s and heartbreak which led to drakes first major hits which created drake. T-pain is responsible for 50% of the billboard. Be grateful
A lot of people say music nowadays is bad. But those people probably forgot that millions of people make music, and they just haven't found the type they like yet.
People are some dumb. Even recently T Pain just won Masked Singer, is that not a testament of having talent?
Did you know that if you take all the Bieber fans in the world and line them up should to shoulder across the world, a lot of them would die in the ocean?
two random small artists 💀
T-Pain is ALMOST as iconic as D’Angelo 👀
What Shamir song was that, that you showed?
I belived that Usher was very jealous about T-Pain's success
we stan gamer & autotune king T-Pain
T Pain isn't an artist I would've ever listened to (cause I mostly listen to metal and folk) but I'm gonna go enjoy his music cause I bet it's catchy as fuck.
D'angelo invented english and that's why he can convey concepts so well
Why does it matter? You don’t have to listen to his music
Not Twitter trying to cancel T-Pain???? Tf? So glad I’ve been avoiding bird app lately caz nooo
Aaaahhhhh the pitch being the least important part I feel in my bones, voices are the most incredible instrument, this is my new fav video. Also like you can sing every note correctly and it can sound bad.
My man saying he's never made music... You think we forgot the Woohoo Diss track you made?
“autotune ruins music!!!1!1!1!” maybe you just listen to bad music? or you cant comprehend the fact that people have the right to effect their voices? 🤨 if you dont like it, make stuff that you like, stay in your lane. pls.
I don't like how using stone has become a diss. If you don't sound good without auto tune, your not gonna sound good with it lol.
T-Pain is a national treasure
While I'm personally not a fan of how auto tune sounds, as you said, the voice is just another instrument. We put effects and pedals on our guitars and synths, I don't see much difference tbh. Poor T Pain! Usher just sounds like a grumpy old man who's upset the landscape of popular rnb changed lol
T-Pain is an incredibly talented singer and artist! The intense autotune is a stylistic choice, one he absolutely mastered and it's not his fault or problem that a ton of other ppl tried to jack his style 💅
"Talented to the point of being demonic" the perfect way to describe it
T Pain can sing without autotune that's the difference with so many others who are using it.
Plz edit ur audio with a high pass filter at about 100hz i dont need my walls rumbling every time i watch ur videos sheesh ;-;
He's such a talent, hate the clownery arround him. And #FREEBRITNEY
i'm gonna need everyone to listen to the t-pain mashup with kurt hugo schneider regardless of what you think
I will say this probably until I get lowered into the grave, but Twitter needs to go. It needs to be wiped off the face of the earth. There isn't another application that as hateful and anti-productive than Twitter. Idgaf, this is ridiculous
T-pain is talented and a musical prodigy that CHOSE to use auto tune as a way to creat his own sound and stand out. RNB singers using auto-tune to sing their one-note nursery rhymes has zero correlation with T-Pain. When T-Pain creates music and uses auto tune, it's well thought out and wonderfully put together, other singers being below average is THEIR choice. Usher's comment makes no sense, T-Pain sounds amazing overall, he just used auto-tune as a staple, while current artists uses it as a crutch, therefore, THERE'S NO CORRELATION
I’d really recommend y’all watch “The Problem with Auto-Tune” by Sideways! It’s an awesome video and he’s one of my favorite youtubers and he is also sick of the T Pain slander
Guitars can indeed sound bad, and I sincerely apologize to anyone who has heard me play.
It has been over 15 years ever since he used autotune for his music and yall got a problem with it?
Just listen to tpain mashup or search him singing without auto tune and ull know it isn’t a crutch for him
LMAO not labeling The Weekend and Ariana Grande as "two small artists." LMAOO
The amount of drama that goes down on Twitter is honestly insane
Every musician pitch-perfects or autotunes their voice on some way on an album. Those vocals are meant to be the clearest and artistic, or, if you're using autotune, are meant to have some sort of effect. Autotune can be used in really intelligent ways to create a narrative in music (Shadow from BTS comes to mind). I understand not liking songs that are over-autotuned, but cancelling an artist for doing what literally every musician in the industry does is a new level of "so you were bored today".
"Two small artists idk" 😂😂
I think my stove a shoutout im like what up stove
Didn't Usher release that song called Yeah? That was like... The most poppiest pop industry cookie cutter song ever. It was a banger cause it was catchy but like damn.
He gives credit to Chers "Do You Believe In Life After Love" for giving him the inspiration for autotune- I respect it- but people have nothing better to do with their time than "cancel" anyone for some dumb af reason
Usher has ruined plenty of people’s sex life soooooo……
everyone got on t pains ass when he was essentially doing a modern equivalent of a vocoder effect. he himself specifically brought up roger troutmans talkbox as an inspiration for that artificial sound! its just so fucked up that he got so much shit for literally using an effect ON PURPOSE when nobody said shit about cher or daft punk! sideways has a great video on autotune and pitch correction in the modern day and how everyone misunderstands it. t pain really deserved better
this could never be me d'angelo, I knwo t-pain BUILT autotune and IM IN LOVE W A STRIPPERRR he has total hits total icon could never hate
Twitter needs to get on a boat in their flippy floppies, and chill the fuck out.
basically, t-pain is a genius and usher is just jealous
The thing that makes me sad about this type of stuff is that people don't wanna see other people get ahead so they bring out there flaws in that person to bring them down.
A lot o are faves uses autotune, and there's nothing wrong with that. Why are people trying to "cancel" T-Pain for using autotune when that's literally his brand/thing. 💀
Praise God 🙏🏾
holy moly, i love you for introducing me to these amazing voices in this video
Wow it’s early
d'angelo doesn't make music!? i thought he was the no. 1 and only vocal star in the entire world?? guess he just manifests greatness.
D'Angelo is the only person I'd let talk about autotune for 23 minutes
Honestly pitch correction is good. You want music to be the best it possibly can, it allows someone to hit that note they are just shy of it enhances an experience when it’s not a crutch
Twitter ppl: his names t pain not b pain now im mad
This is so stupid, it's neither near nor there Usher. Who cares if he did or not, you have to know that even if T-PAIN really did "ruin music", then someone else would of came along and did the exact same thing as he did. It's irrelevant.
t-pain has always shown himself to be a very genuine person, and his music is absolutely iconic regardless of whether you like it or not. He definitely did change the game, his rampant, obvious (because, lets be honest, if he only used it like most artists used it, we wouldn't be having this conversation) use of autotune made interesting and experimental songs! He inspired a generation! He's a creative, and elitist comments like Usher's stifle the creativity that made him such a great artist.
Does anyone know the background music D’Angelo is using? It sounds like something from Kingdom Hearts but I’m not sure? It’s really nice!
the willow promotion 😩
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05hTQC1CZko  The Problem With Auto-Tune - Sideways I think this video is really good about this autotune subject and yes the title is a little clickblaity but thats how youtube works. I think T Pain is also mentioned in the video and not in a negative way.
JUSTICE FOR T PAIN
The influence of Tpain on r&b cannot be ignored. He DOMINATED 2000s.
Dude he has had braces for 9 years
Is this even considered canceling? This feels like a bunch of random twitter users giving different opinions
and honestly like have you heard t-pain with no auto-tune compared to usher with no auto-tune? like t-pain has such an angelic voice, and usher it’s just kinda like, there.
Okay, I'm gonna ruin Ushers Yeah for you guys. When you listen it, make a notice about that triangel on steroids. I can't hear anything else in that song after I discovered that triangel, it's really bizarre 🤭
Tpain didn't "ruin" music. People trying to imitate Tpain did that on their own.
the one dislike is usher
Not only is T-Pain an iconic artist that pioneered a sound that defined a generation, but he is such a humble down to earth guy like this guy collaborates with youtubers and hes FUNNY he deserves the WORLD   Edit: I just want to point out that Usher can NOT talk about good production when Yeah exists (That goddamn triangle is one of the most annoying things I've ever heard)
Anyway stream T-Pain
TLDR: YOU EITHER GET BITTER OR GET BETTER!
People forget that music is an art form.
I think I’m missing an idea here. Why is it so crucial singers don’t use autotune? I, (personally as someone who plays instruments for fun), get irritated when there are covers with inaccurate pitches and incorrect beats. Not that the song is lovely, but it irks me too much to listen to.
CHLOE and HALLE. That is all.
Honestly, it's just something else for Usher to imply that T-Pain isn't a real singer, T-Pain has a ridiculously good voice!
Usher is acting like he has not used autotune smh, T-Pain is a pretty good singer without autotune, and there are way better singers than usher who have yet to be discovered by a big label, and who are already famous for their voice.
But he can actually sing without it.
People on Twitter are fucking idiots dude. The majority of its users need that shit taken away from them because they have nothing better to do than “cancel” someone or get offended by something and it’s getting real god damn tired.
I personally don't care whether your voice is real or not just as long as the music is good
Yeah, the negatives of social media come around biting you in the butt for something so small
Sideways, a music YouTuber, also talked on how everyone is auto toned or pitch corrected. Artists like T Pain use auto tune as an art form. But when we think of auto tune, we think of t pain like music even though it's often unheard by most
Is so funny that a singer like usher is saying auto tuned ruined music also uses auto tune (it may not be called auto tune but all artists use it in every song so it’s “perfect”)
You're like a kid version of Whoopi lmao.
Gosh, listening to T-Pain's story was soul-crushing. He loved making music and Usher made him question himself. I bet the people saying that T-Pain ruined R&B hasn't listened to R&B recently.  Also...artists who used auto-tune after T-Pain was just getting in on what was popular. It happens with almost every form of media. Needless to say, T-Pain didn't do anything to deserve what is going on and hopefully people see how wrong this "canceling" thing actually is.
I like how a talk box exaggerates everyones face
Doesn’t Usher have herpes
i mean i really dont like that autotune sound, but usher is just being a jerk
Hey dude, I'm glad you're making longer vids these days.
We didn’t like T-Pains music because it was auto tuned, we liked it because those songs are actual bops
i feel like half of d’angelo’s videos start with “people on twitter”
I was going to comment here on my secret 2022 channel but it has so many subscribers and zero videos so YouTube thinks the comments are spam so uh... yeah here's the link instead LMAO https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTrLCM86b-0eOVDSyJtCMYA
D'Angelo Wallace, the creator who always makes you pleasantly surprised whenever he uploads
People don’t understand that music is supposed to evolve and change and it’s not a bad thing. What is popular now isn’t the same as 20 years, and it was totally different from the music from 20 years before that. You don’t hear us listening to medieval lyres and flutes going “man this hits”. Find what you like and leave everyone else alone
T pain is a legend...  So creative and talented 💜💜
Lmao this is funny. The auto tune is his staple😂 he also made it clear that he can sing very well without it
People need to stop seeing auto-tune as an instant negative. Sure, there are times where artists go over the top with the programming, but not only is it an useful tool to reach notes singers can't physically reach without harming themselves - it's also literally everywhere. Like D'angelo said, pitch correction is a thing. It's so common it's stupid to judge someone who uses it, also don't discredit an artist's singing ability just because they can't reach an Ariana Grande. Not like most artists using autotune are pandering themselves as such
Normalize black men and men in general being able to speak openly about mental health and emotions without judgment!! 👏👏👏
Are you gonna make a video about the creepshow art drama? For those who didn’t know she stalked and harassed Emily art show.
Y'all remember went Nikki said husher  this man into clinic , I didn't realize that she was talking about the usher
What gets me upset about this is that T Pain never told anybody to stop making RnB music. He was an influence but the shift is no ones fault just caused by the rise of using auto tune by artists who made that choice for themselves. Its idoitic people place the blame on an innocent artist was just making music the way he wanted.   Edit: How insensitive do you have to be to knowingly place the blame of such a huge thing on someone who was just doing their own thing. Its not "cut throat" that's just plain messed up.
t-pain is a literal legend and nobody can tell me otherwise. good or bad, he's a legend.
all artists use autotune 😭 and before they used pitch-correction 💀 what
I’m just so glad that I don’t have Twitter Except that one time where I had to pretend to be Old Major and argue with Napoleon
T pain has an insane voice, with or without autotune.
People get so upset about autotune smh my head
People need to realize that Auto-Tune is either used stylistically, or for for slight sound tweaking. It isn't a big deal.
*off topic but that birthday song for Ethan was immaculate.*
dangelo blinds us every time with his beauty... i now have lost my sight
t pain desk concert proves that he doesn't need autotune
Anyone hating on T Pain needs to listen to his NPR Tiny Desk concert. He has a beautiful voice.
Wow, people are literally trying to cancel him over the thing he’s most famous for. I swear, Twitter would try to cancel the second coming of Jesus.
What on earth do people think happens in a music studio 😂
“People on Twitter” almost insta-killed me
the only reason I could think of that someone could be angry would be that they want raw talent, free of editing and autotune.
My friends dad is t pain
I made a podcast for college about T Pain and how his autotune is for creative not corrective use
I knew T Pain before I knew Usher 🤷‍♀️
Cancelling T-Pain for auto tune is like cancelling Paris Hilton for being famous because of their image. It’s something that is majorly popularized and used and they were just doing it first. Honestly sounds more like jealousy than anything
Pretty rich coming from the man who brought us Beiber.

T-pain is such a sweetheart I fucking love him
He made auto-tune and he used it. Other singers decided to use it and had hits. And now suddenly, it's a bad thing. But the truth is, T-Pain can sing! I love T-Pain and they need to leave him alone. Especially other singers who knew they got a hit off of him!
people on twitter are.....   questionable
T PAIN IS A FUCKING KING WHO CAN SING BETTER WITHOUT AUTOTUNE THAN MOST PEOPLE CAN WITH AUTOTUNE HE IS AN AMAZING SINGER RAPPER AND SONGWRITER AND HE SUPPORTS SMALLER INTERNET CREATORS WE DO NOT ACCEPT T PAIN SLANDER AROUND HERE!
a lot of the ppl that were coming after t pain in the mid to late 2000s were struggling to keep up with the digital streaming transition that music industry was going through. just take what you will with my statement........
It doesn't matter if you don't like T-Pain's music or the autotune (or any one else's, for that matter), you still don't need to hate on him. Just keep your opinion to yourself or communicated respectfully :)
okay but katty perry isnt anything without auto tune and y'all still lover her. why hate t-pain for the same thing
canceling T pain for doing Auto-Tune is like canceling D'Angelo for being awesome    that like their whole thing.
I remember this being a common thing even back in the early 2010s. People hated on him for singing with auto tune cuz they thought he was masking shitty singing, and then called the songs shit. “How to sound like your favorite artists” by Nigahiga is a good time capsule of the general public’s thoughts at the time. It’s deffo not just some new Twitter mob issue, just an old issue rehashed through Twitter. I’d recommend Sideways’ “The Problem with Autotune” for a really in depth video on the autotune issue.
Lots of genres use autotune and synths so the idea that he ruined music is laughable. T-Pain is a big ol nerd and seems generally nice. Y’all leave him be!
I just went on T pains’ Twitter and that man is pointing at everything with his big finger 😂😭👆
When he said “usher was my friend..” I just cried. He didn’t deserve that.
A verb is an action word…and apparently an action food too!!
There's pitch correction and then there's auto-tune. He uses auto-tune for style. It's not like he's using pitch correction and saying his voice naturally sounds that way. It's not like he made lying about being able to sing on pitch popular. He made a style of sound popular.
This is why I hate Twitter. People go to canceling one person for the most basic thing not noticing that everyone does it as well. Honestly, fuck cancel culture and what it done recently to people like Scott Cawton
Welp, time to just go bleh
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! 🎶
Usher is mad that he doesn’t have the same level of talent as T-Pain. Like, T-Pain invented his own style (or at least popularized it)…
T-Pain doesn’t need autotune and kind of uses it for fun/experimentation and stuff. If you’ve heard him without it he sounds like an absolute angel. :)
real bold of usher to say that when his only contribution to society is happy easter xbox
No one mentions how nice d’anglos hair is
people on twitter     bottom text
Has Usher even been relevant recently? I haven't heard from him in a while
It's like my sister saying "Computer generated music isn't real music". Like, girl. Expand your horizons. Don't discard a whole 10,000 songs because it's computer generated.
Its dumb that someone is getting canceled for something he's been doing for ages... it goes to show how people will cancel anyone for anything
Usher woke T-Pain out his sleep just to diss him. That's a fight outright. Several T-Pain hits still define most of my high school and college memories.
People have this misconception that auto tune is crutch that bad singers use to make themselves sound good, but rather just like any other instrument, it’s simply a tool that you can use in your arsenal to help construct good music. And T Pain in no way is a bad singer, look it up for yourself, he has the voice of an angel. All he’s doing is innovating with new technology to make music that sounds good. If you should be mad at anyone, you should be mad at singers who use auto tune but pretend they don’t, at least T Pain is honest with his practice.
The pop docuseries had an episode of autotune and every person uses it to save time recording songs. It used to take a week and now it takes half a day to record one song.
Pls pls _pls_ watch Sideways‘ video on autotune. It’s so good and it touches on this subject
HOLY CRAP WHERE AM I?
Everyone uses autotune. Some people use a lot, some use a small amount but no one gives a unadulterated vocal performance anymore except when singing live.
Remember that autotune isn't necessarily bad and can be used just as an effect. Literally everyone uses it for pitch correction as well.
T pain always used auto tune. ALWAYS. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 WHY DO PEOPLE WAIT TO GET MAD ABOUT THINGS?!?!? He doesn't deserve this crap, specially from Usher who uses auto tune....
T-Pain and D’angelo INVENTED music
Tpain not getting recognition always broke my heart. He uses auto tune not to mask his voice, but to enhance it in its own sound. Pretty respectable how honest he is about it tooz
There’s no way this actually happened
Your videos make me want to get up and grab a slice cake to have while watching instead of lazily eating the sunflower seeds that have been sitting on the counter
Y'all have not watched the full video
Usher is an irrelevant bitch. I would’ve been pissed he woke me up from a plane nap to insult me.
d'angelo is a fashion icon
Bruh if T-Pain hadn't popularized auto tuned half the mothafuckas in the Music Industry wouldn't even be here
:v I feel like im late even though im early
What do these people be smoking cuz they be high as heck if they think T-Pain caused people to use auto tune. That was their decision don’t say that he caused it.
Enjoyed t pains music back in the day. He has been a cool guy since. We all know he used autotune, duh. He has always joked about it
He’s Great!
he ot depressed. for 4 fucking years. and people are defending usher
What kind of person gets a flight attendant to bring their friend (??) in to some kind of meeting so they can shit on them??
T Pain isn’t even that bad, I can forgive the auto tune, don’t see why these people can’t
when i saw the title: 🤡 ahhhhhhh
What year is it? Are we still really shitting on t-pain for making bops with autotune? That man is talented and makes good music, end of discussion.
If we gon do this to T-Pain, we HAVE to do it to Olivia Rodrigo. Iykyk.
I guess I’m lucky today, I open YouTube and I immediately see this video at the top of my recommended page.
When he said “is he right?” :(((
twitter users are a different breed and i say that as a twitter user
Whoever is "cancelling" T Pain knows nothing of this man's accomplishments and contributions to the music industry. Big surprise.  Usher needs water to wash down all that salt.
Fucking Twitter.......
so true
the whole music industry should get cancelled for using autotune then. heck even i use it, why is it such a bad thing? autotune can’t correct really really bad singing. in an age where technology can further help artists express themselves, is autotune really that bad??
T Pain deserves better
The beanie look is back, incredible how Mr Wallace looks great in anything.
So many artists in the industry use autotune if not all, yet people choose to start canceling T-Pain as if he's the only one. There's nothing wrong with using auto tune so I don't understand why people choose to cancel him
DANM... im hella early
"Usher was my friend"  🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
So weird I am watching "this is pop" and this video pops up. 😎
This is so sad :(
when i was younger i thought that tpain's voice just naturally sounded like that lol
This is so uncalled for...  Aren't they the ones listening to the bad auto tune music-? It's not his fault he can do it and they can't- it's also not his fault ppl continue to listen to that music making the artist think it's cool n shii...  But don't listen to me cuz I'm high
Mad at my notifs for taking 3 minutes to notify me of this legends video. I need it immediately, Susan, step up your game
how...like how? it’s music? it’s just auto tune? like how is it worth a cancellation?
I personally think T Pain was disrespectful when he waa saying that aaliyah was nothing more than a beyonce rip off.....when she was before beyonce..
“People on Twitter... I don’t even feel like I even have to finish that sentence because you already know something *dumb* went down” That quote is so true and iconic
He and a lot of other rappers have been singing with auto-tune for years and now people are mad about it?...people will find anything to complain about
Who cancelling T-Pain not I he is a icon and changed the game with his use of auto tune 💯
Twitter is a cesspool.
man i feel really bad for tpain he seems so nice
Feeling the Pain in T-Pain
Imagine being early than D'Angelo's pinned comment. #NotificationSquad
Is that a Bee Angelo hoodie?! Either way, it's pretty cute✌
D'angelo in a beanie supremacy
Tpain could easily not have to use auto tune and still kill it.
Why they doing T-Pain wrong like that
hellooooooooooooooo
aw hell naw so they cancelled tpain for being tpain?!? what’s next? the migos get cancelled for their momma adlib cuz not everyone has a mom!! 🙄
h3 gong
my guy it is 9 o’clock at night   time for a dangelo video
ur favorite artist probably uses autotune lmfao ppl dont know what mixing is now and its sad
OK BUT THAT AUTOTUNE WHEN IT IS SHOWED-
Ive never loved over autotuned music, but this is ridiculous
Looking amazing as usual
108th
eh 40 seconds ago
He really shook the R&B industry up and got basement rappers talking shit? Girl, bye
T pain made auto tune good because he can sing with OR without it. You can’t just slap it on and expect it to be as good as him, he basically influenced a whole sound
Clicked on the video so fast 💨, I couldn’t believe the title I saw. 👀
To quote the legend- “Twitter? You already know how I feel about that damn bird” -miiasaurus
If y’all wanna cancel him for using auto tune then cancel every tik toker with a singing career
Can we cancel Eminem for swearing now? Or Jimmy Barnes for pandering to people who live in rural areas?
woah you look epic.
The title had me tilting my head and pressing my lips😭😭😂😂😂🤌🏾
Auto tune isn't what most people think it is, its more of an enhancement than anything, its used for the effect rather than actually tuning vocals. If you sound bad without it, its not gonna magically make you sound good.
I'm sorry WHAT?! I thought we understood that the autotune is noticeable its a specific sound you can't get naturally like in Imogen heaps hide and seek. Its not ruining music its enhancing it and adding something new to the music. Its not like he can't sing.
yall cancel tpain but not bts- mmm i see the two-in-one racism and fetishization
New camera? Lighting? Something is different? Looks good!
Do people not know he sings with AutoTune as an artistic choice? Jeez these people are clueless
who is d’angelo and why is he the best person on youtube
t pain is precious ok
Oh fantastic, I get to listen to my favorite human today
Keep speaking facts king
A good tip for preserving your mental health: Delete Twitter ☺️
Oh my unicorn 🤦‍♀️
Twitter is literally the worst app on the face on the planet🌍
Y'all?? WHO'S Y'ALL? T-Pain is music legend who's made the genre even better
Usher can't even say he hasn't used autotune to some degree...smh 🤦‍♀️
autotune is literally a stylistic choice idk why ppl so mad
I can not deal with the internet right now but here I am
FINALLY!! EARLY
Wait huh? There’s no need to cancel T-Pain
Who's T Pain? 👁️👄👁️

Holy shit autotune?? An absolute sin. A catastrophe. Shame him! Shame him for eternity. Lmfao y’all are fucking ridiculous 😂😂😂
Idk why people now canceling him like we didn’t know that already
Twitter kids piss their pants at anything, mans just gotta keep going and he’ll be fine.
T-Pain was one of the CORNERSTONES of my CHILDHOOD!!!!!! the fact that USHER was the one that started SLANDERING his name is saying a lot….
I think those energy bars are working, You’re glowing, d’angelo
Holy shit how are this many comments already lol I literally just got the notification seconds ago!
Today I made a twitch account just for D'Angelo and I'm so excited to tune into the next stream!
If this is the case then all artists are getting cancelled
