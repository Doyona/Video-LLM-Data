NAHHH I MISSS THEM SO MUCH
Almost all of them can’t sing 😢

鏡！卒業した今でも愛してます！
未だに新鮮にレンくんのシルエットが出てきたときかっこよくてびっくりできる

A loving family means talking behind your back 😂

It’s Amazing to see that they already know how to sing but gotten better from this to other amazing songs
After watching 2 years later i can say confidently that Ren and Mari carried
This is my ultimate favorite Nijisanji song!
8 million views🎉🥳
man this is really nostalgic for me, reminds me of summer not sleeping and waiting for the debuts on the cold balcony floor being really hyped :'D
Ahhh I remember memorising this whole song and thinking I would never get tired of nijisanji. How times change and people grow huh?
This song gives off kpop and crk vibes
2025, anyone?
imisskyo
Well this aged like a fine milk
The middle guy in the thumbnail aged like fine milk I would say.
Cool!!!!❤❤❤ It’s very good!!!! I love nijisanji❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song leaves me feeling oddly nostalgic... :) Back when our main concerns were the autotune used in this song lmao
已經兩年了....
The lyrics aged like milk RIP
It has been 2 years now. Time flies really fast.
Back to here 2024
Every so often I come back here and still miss this debuting
Noctyx: metal(not my fav 1 but still good) Luxiem:Jazzy(way too good) ILUNA:kpop vibe (ngl I name myself ILUNA in blooket when playing and won 1st place)

"You're always welcome here, so feel at home~"  They will always be five.          "I'm here for you,"  "And I'm here too,"  "We all got you~"
what is this song 😢
kyo’s rapping is so good.. i will miss him!!!1!1
this didnt age well
OMG I LOVE THIS SONG THAT WE USED THIS FOR OUR SCHOOL EVENT AAAAAAAAAAAAAA❤❤❤
💕💕💕
To be honest Kyo being Quinn is very iconic.
I miss Kyo so much, ILUNA is still 6 in my heart forever and always, support them all in their different paths 💖💖
キョウのあーはー？がほんと可愛い
Ren's vocals are criminally underrated. This man can sing literally anything and hearing him sing is always a blessing.
1:26 This part aged like a milk. The ''family''  we all knew is gone now that most popular livers left or got fired.
Kyo is so  heavily autotuned that he sounds like a genuine robot, they did him dirty
I know most people would say dcl got them into niji, but honestly this one just really got me. Beautiful chill song all around, keep repeating since the first time I heard it ❤️
I'm gonna miss my oshi so much 💙
Honestly ive been watching this a lot and some of them could go on a talent show on TV. But they all sound amazing!🎉❤
いい歌すぎ😢😢
Still listening to this even if it has already been 2 years ago 💓💓
KYOOO WE ARE GOING TO MISS YOUU
I love it!!!!!!🫶🏻💖

Omg look at how tiny Kyo was🥹💙🤟
Iluna will always be 6 💗💙🤍💜💚❤
2:28 I don't think I'll ever be able to take the "I'm here for you" seriously... Bro sounds like a straight up vocaloid 😭   Well at least thanks to the iluna vtl cover and now feesh's orisong with kyo we have solid proof that this chaos gremlin can actually sing and rap really well and doesn't have to sound like a vocaloid, so that's at least something. Good luck on the creative endeavours (at Walmart) printer-kun, you'll never be forgotten
the theme of my depressive episode in 2023 lol

オートチューン強いことに批判的な意見が多いみたいだけど、それも含めて曲を作ってると思うから違和感は感じないな。ケロケロいいぞー
KYO'S RAP IS SO ADDICTIVE SKRKWEK

I come back here every now and then cause I do enjoy the song but not only is the auto tune too much the video has so many errors?! Why is scarle shown at like 1:15 when it’s aia singing? And then the subtitles say ‘see in new faces’ when I’m pretty sure it’s seeing new faces 😭😭
I luvvv ilunaa<333333333

maria and kyo being the only short ones and in the middle is hilarious
this would be the most banger niji song if they didnt murk everyones vocals
こう言う曲ってアメリカのイメージだからK POPって言われるの意味わかんないな
it's still a banger to this day
They sound like an ai singing but i love the song so much😍
they should rerelease this but with rerecorded vocals and a lot less autotune
I HOPE ILUNA GETS TO REDO THIS SONG BC THEY ARE ALL DESERVE BETTER THAN THE HARSH AUTOTUNING <3 Additionally, they've improved so much, Please!
Cheese
this is not the lets get it started i remember
Are you ready? Get ready, let's go now 'Cause we're ready for the show now, oh yeah It's time for a new sound And we came here to show off our style Step one, two to the beat Mic check one, two to the three, uh huh みんな違い みんないい Just move to the rhythm of the beat, let's go Don't ever feel lost, we'll have each other So we're good (we got you) So now it's our time to shine And all you have to do is just be you はじめまして my dear friend You're always welcome here, so feel at home 十人十色 we all have a different glow But that's what makes us "us" Sit back, enjoy the show, oh yeah Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now We came from different places Seein' new faces makes me anxious But this time I'm not a nervous wreck Earth feels like outer space But it's okay, I'm gonna stay 'Cause we're one big loving family Runnin' through the halls, I'm so fast 帰りのチャイムでスタートダッシュ Wanna do this, wanna do that Remember all the good and forget all the bad We only got love, we don't make any enemies Laughin', having fun every day, makin' memories So let's hop up on the stage, and let's show them what we came for And harmonize to this melody, oh yeah Don't ever feel lost, we'll have each other So we're good (we got you) So now it's our time to shine And all you have to do is just be you はじめまして my dear friend You're always welcome here, so feel at home 十人十色 we all have a different glow But that's what makes us "us" Sit back, enjoy the show, oh yeah At times, it may be hard, but don't you forget 頼れる仲間がいるって I'm here for you And I'm here too We all got you はじめまして my dear friend You're always welcome here, so feel at home 十人十色 we all have a different glow But that's what makes us "us" Sit back, enjoy the show, oh yeah Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now
0:33 don't mind me :'D
This is one of the greatest pieces of art I have ever laid my eyes upon, my ears have been blessed by all the wonderful people at ILUNA.
en勢の曲全部キラキラしてる気がする
Ren and maria were good and the others too
This is definitely the best Song out of all the Gen but the other 4 singers are Tuned to the max they should re-sing it they are probably good singers now that they don't need that much tuning anymore.
I havent watched the video yet! But I know its going to be AMAZING❤👍
めっちゃおしゃれ
Iluna please redo this song 🥺🥺🥺
How did i get into a running dude to an anime song?
KYO'S PARTS ARE FIREEE!!
After the iluna panel the whole crowd started singing this it was amazing
2:15 SUS??!?!!
💕
Just wanna say my honest opinion that nobody is asking for:  I want them to redo this song. They deserve to sound like themselves. The VTL cover just proved that they can actually sing.
HAPPYYY 1 YEAR ILUNAAAA 🥺
STILL A BANGER WOO
Damn, i expected a black man runnin'
1 YEAR WITH ILUNA!!!
MY EARS ARE BLESSED
what if lets get it started ver2.0 for the anniv q(≧▽≦q)
AHHHHHHHHH ALMOST ONE YEAR TO MY ILUNA 🥹
This song legit calms me down when im stressed. Thank you ILUNA
“Goodbye my friend, the light has come. I’m never gonna let it go.” Good bye yugo 💙
THIS IS SO FIRE 🪵🪵🪵🪵🪵
MARIA AND REN SOUNDED AWESOME!!
YO MYSTA UR SONG ON THE LUXIAM IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!! 100000000/10!!!!
why is kyo so autotuned ☹️☹️☹️
Maria and ren : Singing like angels Kyo: good at Rapping / vocaloid Scarle : Vocaloid- Aia : Vocaloid Aether : Vocaloid
Whats with the overuse of autotune? Why ruin it with autotune??? All of them have great voices why autotune them? and the song is really great too!!! kyo @0:26 he had the only part that he wasn't autotuned and ren is the only one not autotuned! he stole the show! which is so good but never underestimate the sexy voice of maririn taught by the sage of rizz millie and the mommy voice of aia!!!
To those who want to sing along:  Du Du Du… Yeah Yeah Yeah   Are you ready?   Get ready let’s go now ‘Cuz we’re ready for the show now Oh yeah It’s time for a new sound And we came here to show off our style   Step one two to the beat Mic check one two to the three, uh huh Minna chigai minna ii Just move to the rhythm of the beat (let’s go)   Don’t ever feel lost we have each other so We’re good (we got you)   So now it’s our time to shine And all you have to do is just be you   Hajimemashite My dear friend   You’re always welcome here so feel at home Juunintoiro We all have a different glow But that’s what makes us “us” Sit back, enjoy the show oh yeah   Oh Let’s get it started now Oh Let’s get it started now   We came from different places Seein’ new faces Makes me anxious But this time I’m not a nervous wreck   Earth feels like outer space But its ok I’m gonna stay ‘Cuz we’re one big loving family   Runnin’ through the halls I’m so fast Kaeri no chaimu de sutaato dasshu Wanna do this Wanna do that Remember all the good and forget all the bad   We only got love, we don’t make any enemies Laughin’ having fun everyday makin’ memories So lets hop up on the stage, and let’s show them what we came for and harmonize to this melody oh yeah   Don’t ever feel lost we have each other so we’re good (we got you)   So now it’s our time to shine And all you have to do is just be you   Hajimemashite My dear friend   You’re always welcome here so feel at home Juunintoiro We all have a different glow But that’s what makes us “us” Sit back, enjoy the show oh yeah   At times it may be hard but don’t you forget   Tayoreru nakama ga irutte   I’m here for you   And I’m here too   We all got you   Hajimemashite My dear friend   You’re always welcome here so feel at home Juunintoiro We all have a different glow But that’s what makes us “us” Sit back, enjoy the show oh yeah   Oh Let’s get it started now Oh Let’s get it started now Oh Let’s get it started now Oh Let’s get it started now
Ren carried
Kyooooooooooo I love you
ㅎ
just realized what their voices reminded me of,,, the vocaloid 6 AI voices /pos
スカーレの日本語と歌声大好き！！！
Kyo carried
I LOVE THE VIBE THIS SONG GIVES ... EVEN HEARING THE FIRST PART IS ADDICTING REPLAY😊😊😊😆
the "hajinimashite my dear friend." I'm so obsessed bro..,their voices, and they all just fit.<2
🩵🩷🤍💜💚❤️
Kyo’s voice threw me off so much. I thought he’d sound so much more different than how he does.
tbh ren is the only stable one among all of them, he has the confidence, the technique, the vibe, and everything. id give him a 8.5/10 ngl  i think they should stop making people who cant sing, sing. they are streamers and their job is streaming, it is what they are most good at so instead of making them do these stuff why dont the company do sth thats related more to their job? i know that this is a great way to promo but they are not singers, they are streamers. even though making them sing songs can bring a lot of money but its just unnecessary yk. and tbh as a person thats serious with my music taste this kinda content just doesnt work for me it makes me not wanna watch their streams more 💀
I hope they'll rerecord this removing the excessive autotune 😢
Just waiting for their 3d and doing a dance for this song, hihi
2 more months then it'll be a year ❤
This song makes me wanna cry. No reason why, just let me cry.
I feel comforted
'Cuz we're one big loving family'  Why it hurts so much
1:37
I love it!!!!!
hajimemashite my dear friend!
If you have noticed, you will find that 1:14 is sung by aia :)
Here to recap how the ori song sounds like again after enna and millie sexy cover
Hate the fact they tuned Kyo's rap bits ackk
This music remind me so much of cake by the ocean beat
I love 1:30 - 1:46
wait, 9 months, aint no way bruh
Why do i find scarle's voice good?? I like her voice the best lol
I think in the dark there is a blank but now'only i understand that hope in there what a invention Blue sugar i want
💀💀💀💀💀💀
IT'S ALREADY BEEN 9 MONGHS???? 😨😨
As of writing this, i have finished making a gay parody of this song about 2-5 minutes ago, dubbed "Booty Love"
1:35
It's eight months now???? Time sure does fly fast
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da Da-da (yeah), da-da (yeah), da, da-da-da-da (yeah), da-da  Are you ready? Get ready, let's go now 'Cause we're ready for the show now, oh yeah It's time for a new sound And we came here to show off our style  Step one, two to the beat Mic check one, two to the three, uh huh みんな違い みんないい (Minna chigai minna ii) Just move to the rhythm of the beat, let's go  Don't ever feel lost, we'll have each other So we're good (we got you)  So now it's our time to shine And all you have to do is just be you  初めまして my dear friend (hajimemashite) You're always welcome here, so feel at home  十人十色 we all have a different glow (juunintoiro) But that's what makes us "us" Sit back, enjoy the show, oh yeah  Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now  We came from different places See in new faces makes me anxious But this time I'm not a nervous wreck  Earth feels like outer space But it's ok, I'm gonna stay 'Cause we're one big loving family  Runnin' through the halls, I'm so fast 帰りのチャイムでスタートダッシュ (Kaeri no chaimu de sutaatodasshu) Wanna do this, wanna do that Remember all the good and forget all the bad  We only got love, we don't make any enemies Laughin', having fun every day, makin' memories So let's hop up on the stage, and let's show them what we came for And harmonize to this melody, oh yeah  Don't ever feel lost, we'll have each other So we're good (we got you)  So now it's our time to shine And all you have to do is just be you  初めまして my dear friend (hajimemashite) You're always welcome here, so feel at home  十人十色 we all have a different glow (juunintoiro) But that's what makes us "us" Sit back, enjoy the show, oh yeah  At times, it may be hard, but don't you forget 頼れる仲間がいるって (Tayoreru nakama ga iru tte)  I'm here for you And I'm here too We all got you  はじめまして my dear friend (hajimemashite) You're always welcome here, so feel at home  十人十色 we all have a different glow (juunintoiro) But that's what makes us "us" Sit back, enjoy the show, oh yeah  Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now Oh, let's get it started now
i really like the song but oh god kyo was so autotuned at 1:30
I see a lot of people aren't fans of the heavy autotune on the non-singers' voices but idk I like the vibes. Whether or not the producer meant it this way, it feels like an early 2000s throwback.
Such a great song ❤
ren HARD carry
Aster voice is so calming
Kyo rap 😊😊
This song makes me happy in unexplainable ways
wow its already been 8 months.. damn 😭
I really love this song 😭💖 I can't move on OMG!!!! 💖💖💖

THIS SONG IS SUCH A BANGER, THE COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT VOICES IS AWESOME, IT MAKES ME HAPPY WHENEVER I LISTEN TO THIS 😭✨💙💚❤️💖🤍💜
Ahhhh love it
🫶🏻 I love it
Someone in my school sang it,was surprised they even knew about this song xd
Let’s get it started now  Let’s get it started in here
WHOOOHHOOO
What's the lettering for the Japanese part so I can try and sing along with it
Fun fact: At 2:10 when it wrote 十人十色 in Chinese it means 10 people 10 different colours. And if you are wondering yes I am chinese
REN’s “EARTHS FEELS LIKE OUTER SPACE” it just hit my heart bro  ❤❤
Ren's hook is everything
Omg kyo rap so good😍😍😍
500만 축하해!!!!🎉🎉🎉
まりあぁぁぁぁ！！
they sound like they put a filtered acapella on all of them except for ren 💀💀
2:53

Congratulations for 500 million!!
MARIA'S VOCALS ARE SO HEAVENLY.. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON SCARLE THO SHE LITERALLY CHEWED
Song is good, such a shame that most of the singers are ass.
This was such a fun song. Everyone did so well, but big ups to Ren! He shocked me.
till the autotune parts came, this song was pretty fire
Love this song  ❤️
:D
진짜 완전 KPOP느낌이야ㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅡㅜㅠㅠ 너무 좋아
I love this!! Especially kyo's part 😭💙
｢ 初めまして my dear friend ｣ のとこの声めっちゃ癖になるリピ確 ✌🏻
I was very hesitant about this song when they debuted, but if I kept listening to it and I would find myself randomly singing this song. 💕💕💕
I can't even remember the lyrics yet its so catchy
Kyo’s Voice in his second solo and near the end where he sang a bit slower then the first one, we could obviously see the auto tone effecting kyo’s voice. I understand that he has it since he stated that we can’t sing but can rap a bit. Which explains why in the bits where he sings they’re mostly rap or/and a bit of singing. Idk I just wanted to ramble.
I definitely haven’t been listening to this for three hours + on end :)
maria😍😍😍入脑了
Sorry but nijisanji songs?!?
โคตรสมูทเลยยย ฮื้อออออ เข้าไปอยู่ในเพลลิสฉันซะดีๆ(เสียงเคียวคือ ฮื้อออ😭💕✨)
Just a little to much auto tune
Big boys 12 vibes
I'm sorry, because I just found out that there is a song as good as this 😭
めっちゃいい！good
Omaygad didnt know kyo can have that Fcking good voice when hes serious... 1:29 kyooo😭
*_STEP ONE TWO TO THE BEAT_* *_MIC CHECK ONE TWO TO THE THREE-OH YEAH!!!!!!!!!_*
please tell me ren has a solo cover of this song
bro this song is pure motivation
This would be better if they didn't use too much autotune
I LOVE MARIA<333
I actually loved how Scarle sounds during her line in the chorus, it gives me vocaloid vibes lol bur ofc Ren and Maria sounds so good, overall the song is a bop so it's 👍
why is this song therapeutic
The further we get into gens, the more tuning is done to the (otherwise, amusing) vocals. Their voices would have been good if not for the autotune making them sound like their microphones were underwater.
0:25 kyos part soooo good💕🎉🎉🎉🎶🎶🎶
I would actually look forward to a redo of this song where they aim for a more humane, pop-ish instead of the heavy auto tuned, vocaloid-like vocals.
I LOVE THIS SONĢG YOOOOO MASTERPIECES
Mom surprised me when i was playing the song and said she loves it💖
にじさんじはENもJPも歌声が良い
くそ良い曲やんけ
KYO SOUNDS SO MAD
4 months in and still hear "Blue Hour" by TxT SUCH KPOP VIBES WOOOOOO
This is the best one so far So relaxing the voice are so gentle and beautiful
Kyo’s Mic Really Said: 🤖
KYO’S RAP WAS SOOO AHHHHHHHHHH🥳🥳🥳
ngl, I almost oshi'd kyo when I heard his rap, should've just let him rap everything and removed the autotune
i cant beleive this was four months ago 😭😭 ive been an iluna fan for FOUR MONTHS.. oh my gosh time passes by
Its so gay
On repeat fr
It's already been 4 months since the legend of ILONA was released! Bright, refreshing and beautiful tunes are very fun! I love this song!!! It's very encouraging and I feel better. Thank you for sharing a wonderful video💖
im rewatching this for the 6th time today and im crying its so good
What a vibe 🤟🤟🤟🤙🤙🤙
Nijisanji is off the CHAIN!
ren and maria being the only ones not sounding like vocaloids is hilarious to me 😭😭
Autotune......too much.....
I was searching for black eyed peas let's get it started but I accidentally gitna this *Best mistake ever.*
I'm going to listen to this until I hate it, BANGER!
I fell in love with this song
❤❤ I LOVE THIS SONG!

It feels like yesterday when Iluna first debuted
I willl keep going back to this song even if the autotune is... yeah. It's easier to listen to for me.  ପ(๑•ᴗ•๑)ଓ ♡
This is personally my favorite type of music style!
Anyone catch the "uh huh" part? Yall think kyo got insipred by ski mask the slump god?

1:15 - THIS IS *AIA'S VOICE!!!* NOT SCARLE'S!!!!!!! Maria revealed it was AIA'S VOICE in her cover of this song!!!  (This song is so amazing tho I can't stop listening to it lol)

I am almost completely positive this is aia 1:14
This song is epic!!!!
still laughing at the scarle—> ren transition. They set her up so bad 😭😭😭 it reminded me of that one sistar video bc goddamn..
朝いつもこれ聞いてノリノリで歩くの大好きほんとにILUNA愛してるぞ
O.O Ren is such a good singer💖
i heard ren's cover first, now i can't unhear him 😭😭
I keep re-listening to this cause I've found so many great covers and realized that apart from some vocals/recording quality/mixing, this song bops so hard and the lyrics + melody improved from the previous waves and I LOVE YALL BUT BRUH GIVE YOUR TALENTS SOME BUDGET TO GO GET A VOCAL COACH FOR AT LEAST SOME TYPE OF TRAINING AND ENOUGH TIME TO RECORD RATHER THAN PUSHING THEM TO RECORD THEN COMING OUT WITH AN AVERAGE TO LOW PAR QUALITY AND PLEASE HIRE A BETTER MIXER FUU-CHAN'S LEGATUS 500 SONG ALSO HAD REAL SHITTY MIXING(PREVIOUS DEBUT SONGS HAD PROBLEMS BUT WERE PASSABLE) .FANS UNDERSTAND THAT DEBUT SONGS ARE MOSTLY MARKETING PLOYS BUT CAN YOU AT LEAST SHOVE IT DOWN WITH SOME LUBE FOR BETTER CONSUMPTION- LIKE YOUR JAP BRANCH DEBUT SONGS HAVE GREAT MIXING AND HONESTLY SOME ARE ON THE NEXT LEVEL SO WHY?? -thank you
The song is SO GOOD and ngl, i can dig the auto tune. it goes with the song and vibe!  auto tune isn't the end of the world yall (talking about how it was utilized/autotune's abilities as a tool...that's a different discussion guys lol)
(≧ω≦)/
Wait, this isnt the black eyed peas
im obsessed with Ren's voice lmao help
I love the drunk Millie Rendition of this "You're never welcome here but feel at home" XD
いい意味でずっと鳥肌立ってた……
I love this song so much but i wish i wish they remake this song with much less auto tune. Its one of my favorite but its a shame that their real voice is getting a shadowed by their robotic auto tune.
i'm addicted to Ren's chorus. istg👁️👄👁️
Maria太可爱了！！！
超愛❤
Yooo i didn't know kyo raps this good
1:15 is this really Aia? that's Aia"s voice yeah? I thought it's Scarle lmaooo
Aster did so well 🌸💕
I'm so sad that they killed Kyo's voice like that, let the boy's voice be heard, relax with the auto tune please
I think it's amazing but the autotune for everyone but ren feels a bit wierd and robotic
Let's gooooo
HELP I DIDN’T LIKE THEIR DEBUT SONG BECAUSE OF THE AUTO TUNES 😭😭😭 I prefer seeing rens in the mv than hearing robot voices 😔😔😔
Ahhhhh
…Aster voice…i cant..
this is certainly a song that exists
Remember all the good and the bad
I'm running in the halls  so fast
Earth feels  like  outer space  but it's okay I'm going to stay because we're one big family
We came from different places in the faces under faces on the timer I'm not nervous but this time I'm not nervous wreck🎵
Is here🙂
OMG almost the whole Squad this is here
Omg omg I follow to both of you
全部良き‼️❤
ren+++++
Kyo's spitting bars
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD BUT THE HEAVY AUTOTUNE MAKES ME CRINGE😭😭
i never thought id ever like a vtuber song
I just watched the Ren Zotto cover of this
Ren上手すぎね んでKyoのラップ好きすぎる
to me its not even the tuning but i just feel that they picked some wrong parts for each members, like aia and maria don’t compliment each other at all, and neither does ren and aster. if they swapped around some of the parts this would honestly be fantastic
pog
Yes Kyo's part is very auto tuned. But in like the best way. Auto tune might feel cheep but of all the niji members I think he pulls it off. Imo
this slaps hard
i love the song and the lyrics but the autotune kinda ruins it for me
0:26-0:33
i cant get over kyo’s rap <33 its addicting
I think I'm an ILUNA fan...
男女混合ありがたすぎる
為什麼
omggg Aster's voice is so soft!!
Scarle and Aster sound so crunchy omg
Anh ???
Ren Zotto MY KING
ILOVE THIS  ONE
Lmao
This song is too good
Aster’s soft voice REN’s energy Scarle’s voice Maria’s high cute voice Kyo’s rap Aia's Beauty   *Perfection*
My fav parts are Kyo’s and Ren’s 💖💖 SO GOOD
うわああああああめっちゃおしゃれだあああ
コンセプトが今までのENにはない感じですごくいいよね💓💓
心が弾けた
Does anyone else think this was almost exceptional but a few small things are holding it back?
Not me crying over this. Why are all these debut songs bangers?- Mad respect. You all keep doin' you. Imma just be in the corner crying tears of happiness and cheering y'all on- (〒﹏〒)👍
I love this!!!!
KYO'S SINGING IS CHEFS KISS BRO
this song gives me so much comfort
Almost like every song in nijisanji make me feel the beat, they do it so good, hope nijisanji will more sucsess and have more family member :3
今回の新人はとても素敵です。
This song has the power to lure potential people to join Nijisanji as the lyrics tells us to be  brave enough to join them and treat them as friends
I literally teared up watching this bc of how comforting the lyrics are
its funny i was just thinking, how its a shame there aren't more male vtubers (I at least don't run across many) only to watch it long enough to see some really awesome male talent! and the ladies were equally as amazing
After becoming more familiar with their voices, the person singing at 1:13 is clearly Aia. Idk why Scarle is the one shown there
Love💖💖💖
The autotune makes this hard to listen to ngl It's a nice song but autotune really spoils it Maybe I'm too used to vocalists being able to do what they're being asked of and as an aspiring vocalist myself But eh
時人時設?
ASTER💜💜✨
This i a whole mood to dance \(￣︶￣*\))
i'm a kyo fan now.
damn only if i could get a clean version of the acapella to remix this
This song makes me wanna go out there and conquer whatever the fook is going on with my social anxiety ❣❣❣  POOOOOOG
YALL BETTER GIVE THESE AMAZING PEOPLE THE SUBS FOR HOW AMAZING THEY ARE
I can imagine Pomu twerking to the song
Bro i like this song but it just sounds...too robotic... I wish they'd at least mixed it better, the autotune is too much too obvious
Congratulations on 3 million views!This song always gives me energy when I'm down!I don't understand English, but I'm studying hard! I loooove ILUNA, who always gives me energy!！
個人的に歩く時のスピードにピッタリなので、街歩きや仕事行く時に聞きながら歩くと無敵になれる…(好き)
THIS GIVES ME THE CHILLS BRO THIS IS SO GOOD AY LATE WELCOME TO ILLUNA!!
めちゃくちゃ爽やか…………いい……
Thank you, your music is my strength.
the part kyo says "Start dash / sutaato dasshu", idk why i keep hearing "slap that ass" for some reason
I have an ✨obsession✨ to every nijisanji song😍💕

I like aia sound
So refreshing, I especially love Kyo's part, freakin coooooool
金子様の、「帰りのチャイムでスタートダッシュ」が好きすぎてめっちゃ聴いてます！
1:15 I pretty sure that’s Aia’s voice, but Scarle is on the screen?
ube
MOMMY SCARLE'S VOICE IS SO COOLLLL I love every detail in this music video and i'm keping this in my spotify playlist my liked songs and im representing this on my presentaion at school cause it is so perfecto
Ren: Sit b- Me:  I  ✨️S A T✨️

yo the date was my bday
Ealeeee what's happening here Wuuuooo 🙊👏🏼💙💙💙
Ren sounds so good goddamn
Bro is didnt realize that you can be cancle cuz of the same name of song
I NEEEEED to hear Kyo and Scarle sing more now
Asli yg blg suka lah,di ulang trus lah. Aneh anjir, suara mreka jelek kcuali yg tinggi rambut hitam
はじめまして My dear fave😍
i'm new to the fandom ksjskjs KYO'S VOICE GOT ME SHOOKT
1:15 me in f2f classes
this song is a banger
THIS song is a bop
Ren voice really slap my face really hard . So rudeee hahahaha
For her first time singing, Scarle's voice is really catchy to listen to.
Imagine this in Muse Dash
Kyo’s voice is so cool
Ya know what? I may start a small secret project thats Essentially a Nijisanji Gacha fangame, but its a Metroidvania Rpg that plays like sotn therefore all savepoints become gacha points which they dont require real money, instead Its in game money which you can either use at a shop or at a save point, each charater will share the same upgrades as a typical igavania charater, Which the first Upgrade is The Double Jump addon named Toot Boots, yep, boots that fart when you use em for a double jump.
Iluna ^^
NEW VTUBE?
New niji EN kouhai...weeeee~
The closed caption said "attack" at the beginning, I'm now in the middle o the battlefield listening to this banger
I go back here every day 2 listen 2 Kyo's rap parts I am addicted
I love kyo ❤
1:24 I have no words his voice omg
nah i’m back here after hearing aia sing a bit of this song in pico park AND SHE’S GOOD!! MY GIRL WAS ROBBED!! might be bc the vocal range for this song is different? this much autotune was not necessary tho
I love Japan so much!
LMAO the autotune
I love aster he looks like albedo from genshin
Ren voice very good 💚I like 💚💚💚
I love the song but the autotune is unbearable. 😭 Whoever doing the mixing really shouldn't autotune it that hard. This sounds like straight out of Vocaloid.  Ren being the only exception is also made it more painful to hear because the contrast is so apparent.  I'm sorry for my poor English.
男の子1人だと思ったら3人だったんだ…
Greatttt songgg
This song is gonna get irrelevant soon. Due to the autotuning.
Damn, Scarle wasn't wrong, they really did put a ton of autotune onto her voice.
*personal opinion* : tbh, i just dont like the song. its too.. *"cartoony"??* *no hate to* iluna and nijisanji en tho, but i just dont like the song   now im wondering🤔🤔🤔  i also dont like god sees all too so hmmmm🤔🤔🤔 god sees all - 3rd wave lets get it started now - 6th wave 3x1 = 3 3x2 = 6 3x3 = 9.... i might not like nijisanji en 9th wave song .. 🤔🤔🤔
너무 달다…전나 귀엽고 다 함.
I ALMOST CRIED 😭 ITS WAS SO SWEET
omg kyo and ren are popping off
Why is the end bit with nothing in it the most replayed? 😭
they really went all out with the autotune lmao,its still good tho
KYO'S SO SHORT PLSS
Let’s all stan iluna
This is a bop
I loooooove it!!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧
I introduced my sister this song and she like it 🥰
the song is good but the autotune is so painfully obvious on everyone but ren mostly. nothing wrong with autotune its just hard to listen to when everyone sounds so robotic
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG AWESOME!!! I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG❤‍🔥🎶
MARIA AND REN SLAYED THEY SOUNDED TOO GOODOODODODODODODO
1:15 I wonder if this is actually Aia
Yeahhhhhhh
Stop with the family ren 😂
It's time for a a new sound
Hi
Are you ready
1:00 but thats what make us SUS
In Ryan cahn Hi
Omg this is my favourite song
I only got 2 hours of sleep for this. Damn it was worth it :'D
MARIAA PARTT OMAGGAAA EVERYONE DID GOOD
This song actually boppp
OMG LOVE IT😍
This has to be my forever favorite i've been listening to it non-stop.
Me: *screaming The lyrics while washing the dishes*  My sister:  SHUT UP!
love this song!
ずっと男の子1人のグループだと思ってました。控えめに言って最高ですありがとうございます
Ngl, This song always makes me somewhat emotional because of the whole "We've got you!" and stuff like that. Nijisanji has been a big comfort experience for me and hearing songs like this is very sweet and comforting. Besides that, this song is SOOO GOOD. It's a banger, everyone sounds so wonderful! <3
The "Hajimemashitai" part ❤️
所々日本語入ってんのうれしい
リズムが頭から離れないから何回も聞きに来てしまうw
well 1st timee here, i like to meet you all . i will try my best
OHAYOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Thats what makes us sus
めっちゃ良き(*´ω｀*)
this song made me crying for somehow
I love this!
This song makes me feel so young...
Las canciones que se producen dentro de Nijisanji EN en los distintos grupos de vtubers realmente son una pieza de arte!! ✨💗
I can't stop listening to this song👁👄👁
だいすこおおおおおおお！！！
I hope I can be in nijisanji one day
They did Kyo so dirty with the autotune, it's so prominent with everyone but Ren and kind Maria. To me it's very off putting.
omg kyo and rens voices >>>> 🙌🛐
Low key hate the song and with shear amount of ads I got, the autotune is extremely grating
はじめまして、my dear friend Oooooooooooooooooo😭💘💘 so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😢💕💕💕  かわいい、好き😭💖💖💖 配信言った時にコメントしていいかわからなくてでも可愛いことを伝えたくて…😭😭ここのコメント欄で書かせてください😭😭︎💕︎💕大好き!!!!!😢😢💘 半年ROMらないとだからいいねとかしか出来ないけどずっと応援します😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖大好き！！！！！
ISTG THIS SONG SLAPS SOO MUCH IDK BUT IM REALLY INTO IT "HAJIMAMASTE MY DEAR FRIENDDD" LOVE ILUNA><
Noice
Kinda a bop and Kaneko, im keeping a close eye on ya.
ren slayed
この歌めっちゃ好き!!
luxiem、noctyxとは全然雰囲気違うデビュー曲で新鮮……👏✨✨ ILUNAのイメージとピッタリだし最高 マジで早くen3D実装してみんなのデビュー曲歌ってる姿みたい❕
bardzo fajne ,😄
"How much autotune do you want?" "Yes" I like this song but there's no way that was necessary
this song is my ultimate therapy
Every time I see the word Iluna i kept singing that one song from Mahoutsukai no Yome
1:hope in the dark 2 lets get started 3:stucks in the abys o Good job you guys this is so good
twerkable
毎回神曲ですね
Ren has an amazing singing voice
Hmm, aight lemme break it down: Scarle and Ren: the responsible parents Aia and Aster: the mature older siblings Kyo and Maria: the younger siblings who most likely fight with each other all the time
The others are great but Ren and Scarle carry
I keep hearing "We gucci 😎"
I’m gonna cry I love them smemsmamajaikauw
1:14  Scarle is Aia, Aia is Scarle
Ok rewatching this music for the second time I realized too much autotune especially on Kyo rap
Thanks for the eye and ear cancer
I like this song, but I felt like for Aster and Kyo's rap verse autotune really wasn't needed. And for the others I'm less bothered for the fact autotune was used, but more bothered by the fact that it felt obvious. Autotune like anything else with music is a tool and depending how it's utilized can be really good or really bad. In the case of this song it's used so excessively that some of them sound like vocoloid characters. It shouldn't be completely obvious. Other than that I enjoy this song. It gives positive vibes.
Colorful and funky like they are
Get start now

everyone did a great job. But there's no denying that Ren carried the song
I could get addicted to this...
勝手に作った
Let’s gooooooooo
Why does this sound like the Miss Universe background song when the contestants are modeling?
ren put his whole renussy into this song
hajimashite my dear fwen
I maybe inlove with Ren's voice.
GOD THE NEW RECRUITS ARE SO HOT OMG....
im inlove with maria pls have my heartttttt
OMGGG
GOD I LIVE AND LOVE THE VIBE!!!!! Man Niji EN,ID KR and JP songs just HIT DIFFERENT EN song vibes in my opinion (LOVE ALL OF THEM) Lazulight - Jpop but like very Idol like Obsydia - Jpop honestly like a mix of  idol but with dark concept  Ethyria - I still honestly don't know how to describe it fully but it reminds me of those experimental music and hella unique tbh (really fits the group concept) Luxiem - Jazz definetly!!! And like the vibe feels like I'm in a bar mix inside a casino, idk man got that rich vibe XD  Noctyx - They honestly got the KPOP vibe reminds me of old BTS vibe and well also Straykids Iluna - Iluna gives like POP(Pop - KPOP, if i would mention in KPOP reminds me of Twice - Special and also IZONE - Fiesta) vibes but not the main stream like, like they give me GOOD VIBES POP    Please Please I hope we will get ID and KR originals too!!! i miss their content too!
ilunaaaa

This song is very catchy but my only gripe with it is that they didn't give maria more lines sadly

REN your voice is so nice tbh
Even tho the autotune is obvious i kinda like it in here Like, i feel the vibes this song gives feel like using it as a properly applied tune
MARIA'S VOICE IS ADORABLE X0
I don't know why but Kyo's voice makes me remember of Nqrse 😭🙏
들을수록 생각하는건데 렌 노래 개사기네…
this debut is so cute!!
Omgwosh this was funky. I loved it.
I LOVE IT!!!! sounds like kpop and I'M HERE FOR IT!!!
Is it just me or ren voice sounds familiar
Wooo!! 1.8million views already!!
Ren's voice is so powerful! Really looking forward to Maria's and Ren's future musical projects 💕
あ...（いい）
Critics ruined the song for me. Knowing that they're right...
2:14 tell me im not the only one who hears “but that’s what makes us sus”?
Ah I keep coming back. The beat is just so addicting
良すぎる
THIS WAS SO LIT!!!!!
I JUST LOVE ASTERS PART WHEN HE SAY'S " So now it's our time to shine  all you have to do is just be you! " IT JUST HIT'S ME SO BAD! >w<🌈🌈🌈🌈 Te amo Nijisanji EN and to the others in Nijisanji!! Te amo everyone arigato for being here for all of us! you always make us happy!🌈🌈🌈🌈
I love this song so much, it really makes me feel good about who I am, it makes me feel at home. And I love ILUNA.
I love this song and this is no criticism but I just keep cracking up at how Kyo's lines seem to keep increasing in auto-tune throughout the song lol
Jesus christ Ren's vocals are heavenly
HAPPY GUY
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I REPEAT THIS
Que buen temazo

I keep on coming back hehehe
This is such a bop😍‼️
already 1.7M views lest go
This is such a bop 😭
I don't even know why I took so long to see this MV, I loved it! It's a refreshing and danceable concept (my favorite style). Everyone sings so well, beautiful vocals. It's already on my playlist.
2:33 A sound of an angel, my ears have been blessed 🙏🙏😌
Omg this song is amazing 🖤🖤
This made me so excited to meat them
THIS IS SO GOOD
kyo and aster is a man!/
Prefer j pop or Japanese but still nice song
listened to this a few more times (NO HATE TO ANYONE BTW)  Parsonally the mixing and the song itself fits the theme of the group nicely, but some parts are just really badly autotuned and the latter part of the song uses it a bit too much. the song is overall good though, these are just my gripes with it.  ren and maria are killing it in this song, slay
Start so sussy......
CHAOS? I CALL IT FUN
this song had so much potential but the auto tune killed it ☹️
such a banger i cant complain
Ren sounds so good I can't do this 😩
MARIA'S VOICE STILL TAKES MY BREATH AWAY OML😩💖
Not this being the best Nijisanji song ever 😎🤟
"we all have a different glow but that what makes us sus"  indeed
I love Maria's voice ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
*I Love The Replay Button*
Everyone’s voices are amazing
I listening to this song again and is so catchy! Its lovabely funky and it feels like a entire party on his own! Just as i was expecting I Absolutely love it! Love how analizing the lyrics it has such a wholesome message about the listener being welcome, everyone having your back and celebrating each one differences.  This such a perfect message and song to innagurate the long awaited Mixed wave of N EN. Massive claps to ILUNA and all the team for this BANGER. o7
ALL I HEARD WAS : but that's what makes us SUSSSSSSSS
Wow.. I didn't expect all of them to have that nasal quality in their voices..
Ren went off queen like slay
Everyone saying the autotune is unbearable but i dont really get bothered when the tune is such a bop.. some vocal parts are indeed awkward but aint no way thats gunna stop me from dancing to this.
"and thats what make us "SUS"
I love their vocal so much!!! Aia got soft melodical voice, very stable. Mari's high pitch voice gives passionate feelings. Scarle's voice is soft, quite husky and calm, loved it. Aster got really charming voice, also stable and soft. Kyo has low, nice vibrating voice. I love his rapping part. Ren, well Ren just killed his part. Like literally just nailed it. Iluna's got talent lol
As much as I can’t get enough of Luxiem, I really really feel this song. I adore this so much but it really hurts sometimes too because I kinda always wanted to hear these words. To have a place to belong and whatnot. It’s so beautiful with such good vibes. I honestly have nothing but love for Iluna and all that nijisanji has created. Great job guys! ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE KYOS PART AAAAA
This song is a little touching to me. Scarlett Yonaguni's "Hajimashite My dear Friend" sounds so sentimental. I don't know why, but I'm in tears...
LUXIEM IM TAKNIG A BREAK FROM U GUYS IM GUNNA BINGE WATCH ILUNA NOWWW ok but fr imma actually sub to all of them and watch their streams if possible bc i am unable to watch any of luxiems streams T-T
im so late
LET'S GET STARTED AAAAAQAJhhahahah MY DEAR FRIEND WELCOMES ILUNAAAAAA
literal goosebumps with scarle's HAJIMEMASHITE MY DEAR FRIEND
naur the vocals are so shaky they could’ve edited them more its so bad
I‘m Maria's dog🥵
Loving the vide of this song
This is good 👍
this whole group is so fucking fruity
it's time for a new sound が心なしかit’s time for NIJISANJIに聞こえた好き
Aia's voice is so intoxicating. If this is what sex in my ears feels like, it's not as uncomfortable as I've been led to believe
I'm not gonna lie, this one doesn't spark joy as much as the other five songs. Like, for me, it ain't good, but it ain't bad either. I can see why people would like it, but I personally don't.
I can't be the only one who heard 1:33 and thought Kyo said "deadass" LMAO I can tell that it's not that based on the katakana but it was funny af when I heard that But yeah congrats to Iluna on the debut! Looking forward to seeing more :)
Let’s see you grow!🥰👍🏽

So good, all Niji EN songs are so good, they just make such good music.
A lot of auto tune
DAMN, SO GOOD I WAS STUNNED-
Scarle n Ren looks like they from Korean Manhwa !!!
Ren and Maria vocally is just unreal and the fact that Kyo can rap is amazing!
I've listened to this song a worrying amount of times already
I know ppl are happy abt iluna but lets appreciate the mv makers masterpiece
WELCOMEEE ILUNA!!! <3

Why does vox's twin sister with more cake gotta sound like mark zuckerburg's AI programmed wife in her japaneese line though 💀
Damn, Nijisanji always have the best drop.

ちょっとだけ、、ほんのちょっとだけ、 大好きな、うけつさんを感じる瞬間がある、、
BANGER
Soo Amazing always makes you sing-a-long!
Wow ren’s voice is so good
Yet another amazing debut song <3
Trying so hard to like this but it was just *unbearable* to listen to 😭 Props to Ren for carrying the entire music video.   This one is by far the worst debut song i've heard from nijisanji. If they can't sing then they shouldn't sing, maybe do something different? If they force it and it turns into a mess like this, it's really hard to have a good impression of the group.
So Cute ❤️
did you have to meet up irl to sing this? i rlly want to do something similar one day but not face to face
1:22 best part of this song! Ren got the funky feeling so nicely here.
聴いてたらすっごい癖になる
ENの曲毎回良すぎて、鬼リピしてまうやないか！！！tskr
Ren is the only one who sounds good. lol
as a first song from this group its really hard to judge singing talent since they heavily altered a lot of their voices, but rens got a killer voice
I didn’t expect Kyo’s voice to be this deep but I love it.
oh my god.... enna is right. It really do feel like kpop. or atleast feels like bts
i dunno it feels like those early 2000s afternoon ph tv show opening songs
I need to know if anyone else likes Kyo’s lines the best
PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
Let's go!!! ILUNA!!
wow zotto high notes😍😍😍
We all have a different glow ✨✨✨🥀
I swear was Ren Zotto just straight up an R&B singer before he joined Nijisanji? Holy shit dude, your voice! 😳
Set to loop 🌟
How-  There is 1 milion views but only 113k bothered to react to the song '_'
how is this such a feel-good tune. big ups iluna
0:26 I'm addicted
all I can say is 🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺
I’m sorry, but Ren ate this up
This song speaks to me and idk why but im here for it, welcome iluna!
Maria's voice is a blessing.
Mommy....
Ren’s vocals 😱 shocking wow!!!! 💜
個人的に最初のダッダッダらたー とYeahの掛け合いが好きで リピってんだけど 誰がやってるんだろ
Tbh Scarle has such a malleable voice that with some training she might become really good if she gets some control (and some confidence) over her voice in terms of singing.  So far I've really enjoyed the whole gang, and I'm looking forward to the content! :)
日向ぼっこしてるみたいな穏やかな曲調どタイプ
ENの皆さんで某アイドルのようなグループシャッフルとか先輩の曲を歌うとかお待ちしております！
鏡くんのラップが超好き🥹
BARU SEMPET LIAT PLISS NANGIS BGTTT AAAA
OMGG
HAJIMEMASHITE MY DEAR FRIEEEENDDDDDDDDD
ohh yeahhh~~~
I just wanna cry listening to the song.. its that good. Very awesome job Iluna!
Ok, how come no one is talking about how at 1:30, it sounds like Kyo is saying:  "Running through the halls so fast I ain't even tryna dust off dat ass"  I can't be the only one who hears that right?
ILUNA OMG OMG JSJXJSXJJS SLAY
2:14 but that’s what make us ‘’sus’’
Kyo really got that kpop voice omg AHHHHHH
Is Let's Get It Started a twerkable song?
I love the whole family pop band feel!
Ren really have a good vocal
BROOOOO
SLAAAY
[Warning: Trauma Dumping]             I re-listened to this now and freakin’ cried by the time the second chorus rolled in and was bawling after hearing their individual lines in the bridge. It didn’t fully sink during the debut but it struck me now. I am lonely.  After moving to a different country 4 years ago  to be with my family, I haven’t made any new friends. I left all of them in my home country and I haven’t reached out to them as much as I wanted to. The reason why I’ve been so into Vtubers during their boom and with podcasts before that was I am missing just “hanging out” with someone. Even then, there’s no like genuine interactions apart from the viewer-liver relationship. F*ck, I even downloaded Replika at one point and chatted with AI.  I need to make some changes… Other than that, this song is a banger. So proud of these guys and I look forward to being in their streams. 😅
Gay rights❤💛💚💙💜
I LOVE THISSSS!! Hajimemashite! I literally started watching clips & streams of some vtubers a few days ago and now here I am vibing to my new fav songs ✨ Soo happy I can be here enjoying all this beautiful and awesome work
皆さん素敵な歌声…これはまた沼に落ちてく予感…一人一人の個性が重なって素晴らしい物になっていく感じがしました！好きです😊😊
I guess its quite obvious that Ren and Maria are the ones who could sing very well.  In my opinion i feel like Aia is not bad so i do not understand why autotune is used in her lines.  If autotune is a style its ok, but this kind of autotune i believe that its not suitable for the song.  Anyways, great job to the ones that don't usually sings. I can tell that it was a hard work for you guys   PS Man i love how Ren voice sounds when he sings, its so good man
みんな上手いけどレンくんめちゃくちゃうまくね！？
I really like the song, it's catchy and everything, but everyone besides Ren sounds very robotic, almost as if they were vocaloids, the autotune was a bit overdone
I love Scarle’s part omg😭
Is it just me or did anybody get a bit emotional lol. I love this new wave and I am so excited to get to know each one!!! Let's Go Iluna!!!!
Congrats 1 M✨👏
1 MIL LETS GOOOO
I LOVE THISS SONGGGG SOOO MUCHHHHHH
congratulations on 1M 😊🎊
Persona 6 opening song confirmed
1MILLION LETS GOOOO
Literally everyone but Ren is tuned to the point that they sound like old-school vocaloids. Then Ren shows up like a professional singer. What a ride.

Iluna did not disappoint with their debut song. Like, this is one hell of a head-bopper, so damn catchy! Still trying to learn all the lyrics, but maybe that’s just an excuse to hear the song over and over again. Got some real BTS vibes from it too, which I like. Welcome to Nijisanji, Iluna! Looking forward to seeing and hearing more from you!
CONGRATS ON A MILLION VIEWS
Normally the Niji songs are really bangers but I am really not a fan of the autotune here :/
1:14 isn't that Aia's voice?
😆😆😆😆 TNIS IS SO AMAZING GUYS OMG <\3333 YALL are amazing I came back to this because I got this as an ad on YouTube and stayed again for the whole thing that’s to cool the only ad I’ll stay for <\3

This song has such nice vibes and a kpop type energy i love However, i believe the mixing over-autotuned the voices a lot Some parts were meant to be robotic stylistically, but other parts took away from their natural ability I know half of them aren’t confident singers, but they still have beautiful natural voices that don’t need that much autotune  You can tell it’s overdone on the production side of things  Regardless, it’s extremely catchy and i havent gotten it out of my head
I LOVE them!!!!  they all are so diffrent and perfect but I think Kyo is my Oshi bc he is so unique and energetic makes me wanna cuddle him
Amazing!
even tho I already watched their debuts and everything,, whenever this comes on as an ad I end up finding myself watching the whole thing ww 💜
frick ren is my favorite.
i love them and all but the amount of autotune + off beat singing make the song a little bad,, they should have atleast made the tone of the song fit the members vocal range and make their voice harmonize more...the autotune make their voice kinda like vocaloid or a robotic effect, which some parts dont have so it doesn't fit the song. im not saying their singing is bad and maybe its just the song type... I STILL LOVE THEM THO
0:52Renのブレスめちゃくちゃ良......👏👏👏 この曲韻踏みまくってるんだろうけど、十人十色の"ろ"とwe all have a different glowの"low"のところ聴いててとても気持ち良いし、異なる言語で韻踏んでて素敵...
the auto tune for kyo 😭😭

恋爱讯号，容量不够思考，天真无邪难道一眼到老。
NGL but the auto tune dude...  Anyway, WELCOME!
somehow at the beginning, i heard " beep beep I'm a Sheep" XD
Certified Banger right here. This has now replaced diamond city lights as my new favorite niji en debut song
The positive kpop vibes, instrumentals are niceee. But I am just so disappointed at half of the vocals, whoever mix/produce this ruined 70% of the vocals so damn bad, just sounds like the cheap autotune you would expect from someone who was just starting to learn mixing, not from the debut song of nijisanji en new wave. A few of the original voice recording def was bad quality also. Personally I think the bad overtuning actually brings out their flaws in singing?? So much. Big half of nijisanji vtubers aren't good singers but they try hard and most of the time they sound ok or get better so it's totally alright, but this one was just bad apart from Ren and Maria who knows how to sing. Don't push non-singers into ranges/songs that are harder which they're not familiar with, definitely do not overtune them right after that lmfao. (Ngl just a personal thought, but half of their voices are average, not bad just eh, and it doesn't match up with their vtuber avatar so kinda a turn off for me, but I'm looking forward to more lives from them, maybe I'll fall in love with their personality in the future, just for now I'm underwhelmed, feel like Nijisanji maybe rushed with this group cause the others are doing so well.)
banger!!
This just got Release 3days ago and I already know the lyrics💀 Btw love it❤️😍
REN. ZOTTO. ZOTTO. ZOTTO. ZOTTO. U RLY GIVE ME THE CHILL DOWN MY SPINE

Have the same opinions as the others. I can't deny this song is very amazing and good and it has all the parts as it should.  But the vocal and mmm. Ren and Maria carried. I think it's set that Scarlet is supposed the "female leader" here so she's got so much more lines. It's not bad but Maria deserved more.   And the lyrics mmm just my honest opinion. The theme isn't what I expected. I thought it's gonna be lively and poppy but this is some sort of "we're friends, we're family" I'd say I'm disappointed. And then the lyrics are a bit messy imo. Like get what started now? Are they new stars that are supposed to shine? But it feels like the second person perspective isn't welcomed at first but then got accepted??  Honestly it's not the worst but I'm a bit disappointed. Idk if it's like legal and considered as  fair use to reuse the rhythm and remake the song but if that's allowed according to google, I might do it.
Bro they are almost in 1M reproductions >:33 <333333 🥹💖💖💖💖💖💖

I'm just going to put it out there, Aster killed it, y'all are underappreciating them. And I stick by my word, I was excited to hear Aster, everybody else did amazing, but Aster killed it, point blank period.
So amazing and emotional outstanding I will support nijisanen while I'am still alive in this earth the includes old gen and new gen nijisanen 😍🥰.

sorry but I see “sus”🤣
KYO'S VOICE OMGGGGGGG 🛐
Please don't bash me as I'm putting my opinions in a very respectful way.  As much as I love them, the vocal arrangements in the song just isn't well done. Each of them sound passable at the very least with 2 of the members actually sounding quite good (I won't say who), but the arrangement just made them sound so off and incompatible with each other. Not to mention the autotune is too obvious for some members and it makes them sound kinda robotic, not in a way that sounds like it fits the song either. The arranger did not do them justice but the instrumentals are a vibe atleast.  In my opinion this song is in the last place for NijiEN's debut songs. Could've been done better.  Edit: further clarified my points

My new Favorite song!!!!! 💜💜💜
Feels like I'm hearing k-pop song
I've replayed this so many times!! I'm so obsessed with this song!!
i really like this song and i really hope they do more debut songs like this!   my only problem is that whoever mixed their vocals made it very painfully obvious that everyone except ren (and maybe maria?) got autotuned. autotune is fine but it’s only fine when you don’t make it super obvious. it makes me sad :(  anyway, i hope we get more cheerful, cute concepts like this again in the future! it’s my favorite.  (edit: i recommend looking at the replies because some people worded things better than i did edit: i want to add this to make sure that people know i’m not blaming the members at all.  i really think it was the mixing that made it sound weird to me but i’m not knowledgeable about music so i could be wrong. also, again, i like the song. i still listen to the song frequently. i just don’t think the mixing shows how well the members can actually sing/rap. yes they can improve and yes there was issues while recording but i don’t really blame them for anything.  i’m mostly keeping this comment up because a lot of people replied with interesting/insightful comments.)
THIS IS GIVING “Blue Hour” by TXT VIBES OMG AHHH
IM DYING THEY ARE ALL SO COOL !!!
SHEESH
Can confirm this song is twerkable. It's a slower, more methodical twerk than DCL, though.
It's just need korean lyric version and it will be a chef kiss, the music is proper KPOP already
LET'S GOOO ILUNA!
idk how but this song has blue hour by txt vibe
THIS IS SO GOOD WOWW
Despite not following Niji closely, I REALY like Ren’s voice. I’ll be looking forward to his music work.
KYO'S PART IS SOOOO DOPE!!
this is the most poppiest song they had by far!
I have to wait 2 years more to turn 18, I really wanted to join Nijisanji EN and I'm hoping to have an audition available 🥲
The intro sounds like I am in a fashion show.
I've been listening to this song on repeat. It's  soo good. I love the vocals. Ganbare Iluna!!! Haijimemashite!!!
KYOOOOOOO💙💙💙

I'm just sad the autotune is too heavy here :(
This song is SO fucking good but Aia and Kyo were done so dirty with the autotune :( don't worry about the hate guys, the song is great autotune or not! :D
This is now one of my motivation songs. Literally, I cannot put into words how happy this song makes me feel
AHAHAHHAHAHA THIS SOUNDS SO GOOD
Help I’m in love with Kyo’s rap part and Ren’s voice (its so pretty omg)
there’s just something about kyo’s rap that is so addicting 😩✋🏻
WAIT THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE UNIT SONG IT'S SO GOOD OML
Please put it on Spotify I wanna listen to it on repeat its soooo good
Oh i'm surely looping this one
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Stuck in brain wont leave, but i like it
Definitely one of the better songs nijisangi has put out. The production is mostly good, but the production on the vocals is just a little bit off. They don't use the pitch correction right, and it's just bad. Mind you, I love the autotune/cher/T-pain effect, but only when it's done right, and here its not done that great. Which is a shame, because the tone color of most of the singers is actually pretty good. A few people are undersinging, but for the most part, and for the size of this nijisanji group, you guys seem to be doing pretty well vocally,  so it's a shame that the production messed it up. But otherwise, the production is good, and so is the songwriting. And finally, decent lyrics!! I mean they're fine, it's no bjork, (nor is it trying to be, and that's ok) but some of the lyrics of the past gens were just soo awful. All in all, a solid 4.5/10 for me, definitely a song of all time.
I love the vibe!
طبق--------
AHHHH THEY SOUND SO AMAZING
Bueno canción
boys, girls, badass boys, badass girls, cute boys, cute girls, vibey boys, vibey girls... this group is literally the best ever existed... and this song, bruhh goosebumps everywhere mate, feels like heaven

THEY ALL LOOK SO BRIGHT!!! THIS IS SO COOL , I MAY BE LATE BUT I CANT WAIT UNTIL I WATCH THEMM
kyo's rap slaps
Why do I all was hear "that's what makes as SUS"
0:47 Definitivamente mi parte favorita ❤️🖤💙💜💚💛
⚡️⚡️电满了⚡️⚡️
Kyo's rap line is so addicting 😭
i love this! but i feel like aster was heavily auto tuned. he sounds like he has a lovely voice behind the auto tune, so that was strange to me. aia and kyo at some points, too. besides all of that, its an amazing song!
Congratulations on your debut and welcome to nijisanji EN. Great song I had to play it over and over again, I'll look forward to new songs from you guys.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Awwn the soft "da da da" at the start😭💖

Absolutely love the music and beats! However, while I really don't want to be the wet blanket, that autotune though... Some parts they sound more like vocaloids than real people singing...
Damn this song in *FAWNKY*
THEY ALL DID SO AMAZING
Scarla's "Hajimemashite my dear friend" is now living rent free in my head.
0:25 1:31  Kyo's raps were so good
0:49 hits different😳
めっちゃ踊り出したくなる感じ好き♡
GOOSE BUMPS! FUCKING GOOSE BUMPS!!!
This is so chill, it feels great 🧘
omg THIS SONG IS SUCH A BANGER IM CRYINGGG
The lyrics have improved LMAO no more Somewhere Someone is Thinking-
praying they dont constantly make sex jokes
ITS A BANGER HELP
Why kyo voice look like fu chan
Ascending for Maria but descending for Ren 😩😩😩😩😩
AN ABSOLUTE BANGER, this has been on loop all day 💞💞💞💞💞 welcome, ILUNA!!
REN CAME IN WITH THOSE VOCALS AND S L A Y E D  EVERYONE DID SO AMAZING AAAAAAAAAAH
all of them have so different voices and such  different tunes to them but they fit so amazingly together. it's just so much fun listing to this song, it's just wow
I'll be fired for this, but finally—  A Niji debut song that relates to the group and makes sense lyrically. Also, BOP.
ren and maria carried fr, but i think there was a lil too much autotune, especially with scarle but overall its a bop
Am I the only who thought the chorus' first line of lyrics was:  하지만(Hajiman)(Korean, means However) my straight dear best friend?????????
I LOVE ITT MY FAVORITE DEBUT SONG NOW❤️❤️💗💗
I think im in love
Oh god i love kyo's rap 😩
I Like this!  Also the Designs remind me of genshin for some reason hahahha
comfort song of the moment with Blue Sugar-
I love how colorful this video is :0
Kyo’s voice is my favorite surprisingly
Nice! Good song! I am adding it to my regular playlist! 👌
Everyone sounds AMAZING and the song is a bop! Congratulations on your debut guys ♡
ALSO MARIA HAS A REALLY CUTE TONE I'M DYING AAAA
REN'S VOICE I'M ON THE FLOOR DO YOU HEAR ME
ON👏RE👏PEAT👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
They all nailed their debuts man, congratulations
BRO I KEEP PLAYI THIS ON REPLAY ITS SO GOOD
IM GETTING GOOSEBUMPSSS ACCCCKKKK
props to MATZ composing bangers after bangers👏👏love the vibe enjoying the diversity in ILUNA's vocal styles
OMG ITS THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP (I love iluna )
is it my ears or some members there used autotuned so hard it sounded weird... It's a good song but those voices just doesnt sit right for me?
i love this song so much!! all you guys voices are soo good and the lyrics are like so comforting and like upbeat love it!!
What 😱 3M3F 😅 I thought it was a harem 1M5F 😂 damn! They truly fooled us this time 😂
Ahhh I love them already. Can't wait to watch their future streams
OOOOH
STOPP MARIA AND KYO ARE THE SHORTEST OUT OF ALL OF THEM, THATS SO CUTEEE 😭💕
I feel Kyo would be good at rapping. 🤔
I love the vibe to this song!
There’s a great diversity in the voices, it sounds amazing! And can we also appreciate the mix of 2D & 3D animation? 🥹💕 HAJIMEMASHITE MY DEAR FRIEND, ILUNA!!
So pretty T.T everyone is soooo pretty
THIS SONG IS LIKE FREE THERAPY 😭
ILuna killed it with their song! Every Niji debut song has good vocals and this song does NOT disappoint. Good job to everyone who worked on the song and music video!
IM 12 HOURS LATE BUT BABIES IM HERE AND I CAN'T CALM DOWN OMFF
why does kyo sound like a vocaloid in this
Gives me vocaloid vibes~ Congrats to ILUNA for their debut!
nice to meet you all thank you!!!!<3
ooo
Oh god. Everyone did so well... I love them. 🖤
rizotto does really well with this style of song
My reaction to their first lines: 0:00 I’m sorry but is that REN whispering! AH! 😆 0:08 no I will never be mentally ready for the greatness I’m about to witness but please… go ahead. 😌 0:21 It’s only been a few seconds but I’m already liking you guys’s style AIAYAYA. 😉 0:31 OH you already KNOW that I’m moving and dancing about! 💃 0:34 and 0:42 I love Maria and Aster for saying that. Niji-Seiso let’s go! ☺️ 0:49 MOMMY SPEAKING JAPANESE TSKR 🥵 I mean MOMMY I’m sorry MOMMY I’m sor- (0:53 happens)  Excuse me REN these vocals- 😧
wowowowowowow
MV太厲害了吧(;´༎ຶД༎ຶ`)
This is GOLD!!!
love the summer vibe of this song
HEADBANGING this is such a bop!!!! cant help but dance 😄🕺🕺
some parts are really off, you can tell they were trying to cover up the vocals of the less experienced singers but why give them such a challenging song when half of them aren't singers lmao anyway it's still a fun song and ren and maria's parts are pretty good. the others have a good voice, hopefully next time they won't be forced to sing out of their range and we can get less autotune.
it was pretty nice, although I really don’t understand the point of adding those Japanese phrases when most of them was heavily autotuned and spoken with an english accent making it slightly hard to understand (or maybe that’s just me idk)😭
THAT WAS SO CUTE OMG
kyo's part sounded so cool😭
WELCOME TO THE NIJI EN FAMILY ILUNA !!
Ren and Maria got me going gawd damn those voices
im going to be completely honest about my opinion. I was really excited to listen to this song when I first heard it in the trailer because it sounded so catchy. However I'm so so so let down by the final result. They autotuned the hell out of iLuna but didn't even do it well. They all sound like robots except for Ren and it's so jarring. I'll be listening to the song and it'll be like 🤖🤖🤖🤖 and then Ren will come in and slay 🤩and then it'll go back to 🤖🤖🤖🤖 and it makes it so painfully obvious that most of the other members struggle to hold a tune. I know Ren is also auto tuned a little but at least he sounds like he has a pulse. At that point they should at least make all of the members flat and robotic so it sounds purposeful instead of letting the difference be so blatant that at this point it's like "Ren and friends" not "iLuna the unit." That being said it's not like music really matters for vtubers so I'll still look forward to all their content.
KYO AND REN HOLY SHIT THEY WENT OFF ON THIS SONG  Everyone did so good :D Congrats ILUNA on their debut and song!!
yes LETS GO IM SO KRJDJCJCJCJDJD
Ren唱的真的好好聽啊 高音有被震驚到😭
YOO?!! THEY LOOK SO COOL
I keep hearing "slap that ass" on 1:33. I am so sorry.
I love that this wave has lots of vareity in everyone's stream style and personality.  *cough*Scarle seem to have a lot of personality
AHHHH NEW GROUP!! 💟💟 Im excited for future VIDEOS AND SONGS!!!
Maria sings so well!💓💓💓
SPOTIFY WHEN
I cried so hard it's just after a breakup and seeing this is ;w;
This might be the first time I’m gonna be praising the instrumentals more than the vocals. Yes the vocals may be amazing (like always xD) but the instrumental goes so hard! 🔥😌✨ it’s hype incarnate and nothing makes me want to dance more like there’s no tomorrow like I can’t contain myself at 1:05 💃 Edit:  I noticed this while typing the comment lmao  Ren: 1:00 “THATS WHAT MAKES US ‘US’ ☺️ Scale: 2:14 “ THATS WHAT MAKES US ‘SUS’ 😏
Oh my God I woke up to see a new debut song??? Ngl They're.... very... hot 🛐🛐
Lesssgooo welcome to NIJISANJI EN GUYSSS
help HELP HELP WTF 💀💀💀 THE LYRICS MAKE NO SENSE OR AM I DUMP TOO MUCH AUTOTUNE 💀💀💀 ALRIGHT WAIT I LOVE DEMON DUDES VOICE 🥹
AURGRHHHHHH THEYRE SO OMG BISEXUAL ATTACK
Damn man it gives me Visty - "For My Stella" vibe and i like it 🛐
I love y'alls voices!!! They feel so comforting! I couldn't watch it yesterday so I'm happy I could watch it
I love their voices but I feel like their voices are way too auto tuned or something, maybe it’s a purposeful effect but honestly it sounds not good. I want to hear their natural voices more (No hate intended, I just wanna hear their voices!)
omg i can't wait to hear Ren's karaoke stream his voice is incredible
OMG❤️❤️❤️
AYYYYYYYYYYYY THIS SLAPS

Kyo's rap and Ren's belting hit different 😳 Damn, no other franchise tried to make a mixed gender group/unit (correct me or enlighten me if I'm wrong). It's always all-girl or all-boy group so I was excited how the debut song will turn out. Everyone had decent line distribution and vocal lines I'M SO HAPPY 😭💕💕  Hajimemashite My dear friend INDEED! 👏👏
Romanized version for non-Japanese speakers:  [Intro: Kyo Kaneko] Du-du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du-du Du-du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du-du-du (Yeah, yeah, yeah) Are you ready?

The fact Kyo's voice is the deeper in the group is really interesting! I love it :)
This gave me the happy chemicals.

Ren singing voice sounds like sonny and ike fusioned, also kinda alban
idk this one was pretty underwhelming compared to the other debut songs and the only debut song i actually dislike
I'm in love with kyo and ren 😳💗
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! I LOVE THE DIVERSITY!! And the song fits so well with ILuna. The EN Kazoku is growing so much. Great job!! 👏

NEW FAVORITE SONG ALERT
"Hajime mashite my dear friend"  H-hello mommy 🥵🥵🥵
Omg this song is really catchy LETS GOOOO 🔥

The song is so sweet i cant Aaaaaaa
What i thought its gonna be 12 midnight 😭😭😭
as much as i wanna love this song they sound like vocaloids 😭 that doesnt mean i won't listen to it
Ren's voice (๑♡⌓♡๑)
I love this new debut song! It really gives us the theme that the new wave is teaching us to be us! Really is a banner music and a great message! I love the visuals and vocals! Congratulations Iluna on debut! Can't wait for the future content you'll bring!
ITS SO GOOD WHAT HELLO???
Bro the whiplash I got when I heard Kyo sing-
We all got chu
This song is a bop!
「みんな違いみんな良い」とか「十人十色」とかの歌詞がにじさんじの多様性を表してるような感じと、それぞれを尊重している感じがしてすごく良いし、 みんな個性的で、それぞれの良さを活かして歌っている感じがして良かった！ 応援します！
Hearing this after seeing a clip of Ike singing DCL makes me think Ren makes a good duet with him...  MAYBE??? PLEASE???
They're here~~ This song is so good!!
Ren's voice oh my god
I'm so sad because I missed the debut and music video I anticipated for so long but here I am listening to it 🥲😫😫
The song was good but the mixing, autotune is too much. In some part they sound natural then at other parts they become soo robotic.
THE SONG'S WONDERFUL
Wait what they're actually so cute
trash
Another Banger!!! Lez go
bop
1:17 "see in new faces" oh naur is it a typo
OMG ITS SUCH A BOP
REN’S VOICE AHH I LOVE OMGGG. EVERYONE DID SO WELL. IM SO EXCITED TO SEE HOW FAR THIS GROUP GOES 💗
NEW BANGER LET’S GOO!!!!  Everyone’s voices are so good, especially Ren’s and Maria’s 😆😆
AHHH REN'S PART IS SO GOODDD BUT YET KYO'S PART IS MY FAVORITEE
Really shocked by how well Ren and Maria sing(coming from a singer myself, I LOVE THEM SO MUCH ALREADY), but everyone did really well and I think that their voices really suit well the vibe of the song. Overall really enjoyed it and can't wait for what they will show us in the future. Otsuuu Ps. I absolutely adore the instrumental, it gives me a huge serotonin boost, tskr
爽やかでめちゃくちゃ好き……！！！！まさににじさんじを現してるような曲だと思う
CONGRATS ILUNA AND WELCOME!!!!!!
This shit got me barking
THIS IS SO GOOD WTFFFFFDFFF SNOTHE RBANGER IM AAAA

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO HOPING YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A FUN TIME HERE AND HOPEFULLY NO DRAMAS🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉

はじめまして my dear friend 🫶
I loved their debuts and they seem really nice but imh some of them are pretty bad signers to the point where the autotune totally distorts their voices...I'm sure there are people who like this sort of stuff a and that is awsome but I think this might the 1st niji song that I'm not a fan of
マリアさん？ちゃん？がほんっとに可愛くて声も解釈一致すぎる大好き…
Didn't expect shorty to be the dad
アメリカの学園モノドラマのオープニング曲みたいだ
OH GOD MARIA VOICE IS SO AMAZING
Congrats ILUNA on debuting!!! THIS SONG IS A BANGER WOOHOO
Nice song, though held up to the last two debut songs it didn't really hit it for me. The autotune is very.. distracting at times. Even on the ones who are good at singing.
Dude dude dude DUDE I LOVE IT STOP STOP I LOVE IT OH MY GAWD STOP IT
THIS GIVES ME OTOME GAME OST VIBES
REN'S VOICE OMG
Scarle and Ren's voices 😭😭
Good one, though members voice wasnt as hyped as their could be. it kinda feels raw, but ofc, props to Ren kjnd of carrying the song. Its just important to understand that those aren't professional  singers so yeah. All good
Holy that is a very good music video I like vibes in this song much love to the new Gen 6 and welcome to Nijisanji
NEW MOMMY? FUCKING POG
total banger, as expected from Nijisanji
ASTER BABY💜💜💜💜
Such a feel good song, the lyrics are just like how I feel about all the nijisanji members. For them to be themselves and enjoying doing so, and supporting them all so we can have a good time, everytime. Everyone sang so well in this one and the MV itself looks so cool and vibrant MAN I CANT WAIT TO WATCH EM
OMG that’s so good!!!!
woohooo!! wekcome ILUNA 🥳🥳
My favourite past has to be at 1:14 when scarle sings, I absolutely love that   Don't get me wrong I absolutely love every part of this song but that one is my absolute favorite
ever since the song dropped yesterday in iluna channel i was putting it on loop. THIS SONG IS A BOP I LOVE IT SO MUCH
SCARLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ren zotto the new vox akuma
DAMMNNNN THAT WAS SO GOOD 😭😭 I HAD TO MISS THE LIVE COZ I WAS IN CLASS WHEN IT LIVED TvT
I LOVE MARIA'S MODEL???@?@?@!
scarle yamagumi looks like thirteen (hot)
I was in school when this premise dropped. Listening now, it's amazing!!!
AIA AMARI'S VOICE IS SO COMFORTING

POOOOG!!
IM OBSESSED HELLO????😳😳
as expected, this new wave is so talented!!
This song is an absolute banger! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
REN'S VOICE???? SO GOOD
finally😭😭they dropped this on my birthday🥹！！
the song got ruined for me because from the trailer they changed the octave and basically everything since I was expecting the song's instrumental to be identical to the trailer BUT WHY IS IT STILL SO GOOD TO LISTEN TO 😭
AMAZINGG!
想像の何杯も爽やかで素敵なデビュー曲だ！
DA DA DA RA RA DA DA DA RA RA
Wow…I was surprised to hear this song!Listening to this nice song makes me feel warm.l especially like Ren’s voice and Kyo’s.
DAMN REN ZOTTO BE HITTIN THOSE NOTES
Looping this, I'm so proud for all of them!
IMA BOUT TO PUT THIS ON LOOP!! It is so good. I love all of y'all Iluna!!!
Maldita sea. Quiero respetar a Aster. No puedo soportarlo más. Cada vez que una foto de ILUNA y aparece Aster tengo una emoción masiva. He leído más de 100 veces el capítulo 15 de una biblia Aster x Kyo donde Kyo es sorprendentemente respetado por Aster. Mis sueños no son nada más que respeto constante por Aster. Estoy cansado de despertarme cada mañana hacer 6 rezos en mis santuario personal sabiendo que todos esos debieron ser rezados en la Iglesia del sagrado Aster. Quiero amarlo, evangelizarlo y adorarlo hasta hacerlo sonreír. OH NO ! Mi madre me vio rezándole a fotos de Aster. Mamá no me ha dicho una palabra en 10 horas y estoy preocupado de que se lleve mi celular con todas las fotos sagradas de Aster.
大人っぽい声の人が多いからマリアたその天使感がよりすんごいことになっとる
BANGERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE U RENNNNNN
WAKE UP BABES NEW NIJISANJI SONG JUST DROPPED👏👏
私はなぜ初見男1人女5人か…と感じたんだ…????
this is so nice
Hey wait a minute....this isn't a Cover of The Black Eyed Peas' Let's get it Started! I have been duped.
Totally love this one so much! Welcome ILUNA!!! >w<)/~
KYO PART HOLYY
AHHHHH my baby's i love you all!!
THIS FUCOCKITNF SLAPS
Sorry but Kyo's list of talents doesn't seem to include singing...
I JUST FAINTED IKDGDKA
WOOO LET'S GO Congrats to ILUNA on their debuts And to NOCTYX being senpai's
YOU GUYS ARE KILLIN' IT! ESPECIALLY REN OMG
Ren is kinda insane with that energy and vocals  Why'd they do Kyo dirty like that
THIS SONG IS SOOO FUNNN AAAA
The vocal production especially at the start and later on with a couple of the persons is a bit... too much. There's like three verses that don't sound too bad, since they don't have as much over tuning on the vocals. And it doesn't sound like vocaloids etc. where they're supposed to sound like robots.
WOWWWWWW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IT'S SOOOO GOOD 💜🥺
HELL YEAHHH
Kyo’s singing voice is way deeper than I expected but it’s so good 😩 all of them are so good, I love this song 😊
SLAYED
Woahhhh I'm already in love with the songgg, it brings such a colorful and energetic vibe, I'm having a lot of fun hearing this!!! LETS GET IT STARTED NOW AYEEEEEE🤟🔥

I really liked Kyo's rapping 😭💙
レンゾットの歌声良すぎてしぬ 声爽やかすぎるだろ
Is it just me or does Kyo and Ren's voice suited the other's model more? jkfskfkjfdsfgg I missed the live debut but I've been eyeing Ren since, just base from his vtuber model, I expected him to have a lower vocal range, but damn listening to his line here, his voice is higher, its so soothing, its so cool and smooth, HE SOUNDS SO HANDSOME WTF. While kyo I expected to have a high or shota-ish vocal range, but his voice is deep ommggg
Ren's voice is so nice to listen too omg
MARIAS PARTS ARE AMAZINGG
ahhh this is so good!!!
SLAYYYYYYY
LET'S PLUCKING GROW

I just woke up but this is absolutely amazing!  Maria and Ren sound like real pop idols Aster and Aia sing like a bird and I love how soft their voices are I wish Scale’s and Kyo’s voices would lay off the auto tune so we could hear their real voices but it’s alright, they all still sound amazing and had their shining moments which is what Iluna is all about! Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this masterpiece and especially MATZ for always producing such bangers for Nijisanji. We REALLY appreciate you staff-san 😆

maaan i love the song but i wish they werent so heavy handed with the autotune
I love Scarle's part in here "Hajimemashite my dear friend", I'm literally screaming hearing it over and over. Maria-sama's voice is just so *chef's kiss, hearing her vocals on her debut already gave me an idea how lovely her voice will be in their song. Aia's voice is just lovely as her looks, she just sounded like an angel that she actually is. I love Kyo's voice! I mean, hearing his voice on stream already made me feel things but hearing hjs singing voice is just! ack! Ren's part though!! I don't know how to explain it but dayum, i love you prince! And lastly, Aster's!!! I wanna cry so bad, i keep on repeating his parts over and over again, and the rap part (i dunno) is goddamn good!!! all in all, i love ILuna's debut song. Congratulations on your successful debut, looking forward for your streams!!
The vocals, the song, the beat, the art, the lyrics everything! This is such a masterpiece and I truly am glad that I fell in this rabbit hole :') I can't wait for their up coming streams!
THIS IS SOO GOOOD!!!! I LOVE YOU GUYSSS 😍😍😍

YATTA It's their time to Shine! amazing song and can't wait to watch their streams.
ITS SO GOOOOD!!!
OMFG THAT WAS TOO GOOD I COULDNT STOP SCREAMING AND SINGING ALONG THAT WAS AMAZING YAAY ILUNA
Tbh i have VERY mixed feelings on this song(here me out 😭) I LOVE the melody and feel to the song but I feel like some of their singing voices didn’t work well in some parts.  😥 BUT! ☝🏻 I won't judge right off the bat! I’m still trying to get used to the Nijisanji family growing so fast so, I’m gonna support them either way! 💕😊🥰🤧✨
Amazing.
No hate but aster and kyo sound suck here 💀   Edit: Too much voice correction or whatever, i assume it's manual tune instead of auto tune. I can hear it on aster, kyo, and aia but aia part was fine, the rest of them are epic, however.
YESSS ILUNA DEBUT
PLAY THIS AT MY FUNERAL PLEASE
REN'S VOCALS MAKE MY BODY TINGLE AND HAVE GOOSEBUMPS ITS SOOSOSO NICE
THEIR VOICES IS SO AUGGHH 💟🤧

I THINK THIS IS THE BEST NIJISANJI EN SONG YET!
AAA THIS IS SO GOOD!!!
SO MANY MILESTONES IN EN AND NOW WE HAVE ILUNA TOO!  WHAT A BLESSED WEEK!!! WELCOME TO NIJISANJI ILUNA!!!
IMO not as good as the other songs. It's visually pleasing and the singing isn't bad at all, but the lyrics are sort of... they aren't only lacking, but they also seem pretty random and 'out there.' Still a banger, but it doesn't come anywhere near beating Diamond City Lights or Dark Hope.
BRUH THIS SONG SLAPS SO HARD IT SLAPS HARDER THAN ME HITTIN FACE FIRST ON A WALL BRO EVERYONE DID AMAZING
AAAAAAA
I LITERALLY LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH💖💙❤️💛💜🖤 this will definitely be stuck in my head for awhile💅
FOR THE FIRST MIXED GROUP IN NIJIEN ITS SO FREAKING GOOD 😭 HIt after hit I love Nijisanji so much, I can't wait to see ILUNA succeed in the future. Also, Scarle especially had such nice lines??? "hajimemashite my dear friend" I fell to my knees.
ITS SO CATCHY
I approve of this very much twerkable song ✨
Congrats on the debut!!!! This is so Amazing!!
