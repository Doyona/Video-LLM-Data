tanner's face everytime he floars it gets me everytime😂😂
Bro i wish you the best congrats, but it looks like yall influencers got cars for good look  you wasnt say real specs, like why twin turbo, how much HP/NM,  what kind of suspensions do you have, what is the function of the bodykit and how much downforce does it give, just nothing you just said " yeah that is look good"   "and this look sick too"
I remeber where it was yellow
bros got a zentorno
I want   to see your car collection

The Lamborghini looks sick!
As your supportive fanbase, isn't this OUR Lamborghini? I expect to borrow this on my wife's and I's next date night. Thank you.
Can’t go wrong with black but yellow calipers with this specific wrap would of looked hard af dude
i was alone on Christmas no friends or family
And dde
Love the rap
Never been a big fan of huracans but this is epic
Well done on making a supercar butt ugly

So happy for you! Your an OG in the youtube game😮‍💨 You have had the most dope car collection especially for how young you are hands down!
Tanner starting to get older😢 I remember when he looked 12
you should get a disp wheel
Mt laguna? SD CA
before it was cleaner
Cookie Monster
I'm not going to lie but from the front angle it looks just like Jake Paul's "Lamborghini"
Wait did you get a new home?
Beautiful details, fabulous car Tanner!  Craig Augsburger
the fact that its on bags😭😭
Congrats tanner on ya new  upgrades ya 1 of 4 lambo here rims ,tires , wrap , twin turbo . So top level n that roof upgrade omg . So fast thanks fir sharing this . Happy new year 2022.
It’s sick seven Seven Mons
Look's good👌
tanner i like your sticker on your micro wave
EMERGECY -you gotta remember to change the steering wheel modules in that model lambo they sometimes let go and you lose steering
Your old rims were in my opinion nicer they looked nice nice ghetto Volkswagen jetta lol
Tanner got hella taste wit cars man! 🔥🔥
Honestly I liked the yellow. You can’t see all the cuts in her anymore with those dull colors
Ugly as car pff
His microwave has a cool sticker on it.
name it cookie monster!!!!!!!!
What was the song for the edit at the warehouse
I really wanna see tanner let out all the power the huracan has on a runway
🔥🔥
Hottest huracan I’ve seen
mann looking fresh!! I'm loving it!!
Cool 😎
Race Darius dobre sto
Shits ugly af
love this new style of vlogs
What happens when the car hits a speed bump
Tanner fox vs tj hunt 👀
7:00  How low do you want your Lambo? Tanner: Yes!
How does this cornball still have a youtube channel and audience?
When you gonna start to drift?
You got to make sure the tyres are warm before you give it the beans bro.
Put a wide body kit on it
This vid is firee
Bro hit up Tj Hunt or HRE to get you better wheels and fitments
Dude ditch the Michelins, they're great tires but that's way too much power for them, there is a reason 98% of TT Lambos on the road have Toyo R888's
WHY IS THERE A PH STICKER IN HIS KITCHEN !
What’s the song at 5:30?!?
Justin bieber lookalike?!
Bro that lambo is off tap sick as love to see that race against the other weapon you got 👌
OMG WOW it is sooooooooo cool
i wish i could do the same things of you tanner
Alex Choi's car looks better in my opinion
you should redo the interior stitching to the same blue as the car
That Car is so sick🤯
Bro with thst blue lambo. And with that haircut and outift you look really like Justin bieber lol 😂
That’s soo fire 🔥 damn man you so lucky
Just go to 1:14 and look at the microwave
anyone know the song he used over the edit?
This looks straight out of need for speed not gonna lie
This looks like the gta 5 online car lol
The Design on the outside and the inside of the Lamborghini is the coolest thing I've ever seen and I love the color black and blue are so cool together. Awesome build Tanner!
Hey you know the guaczilla is a green gtr (nicknamed godzilla) so if you need a name for the lambo you should call it the raging blue (lamb's are also nicknamed as the raging bull) it would make sense in a car guy way and it's a cool ass name
Me being a bmw fan boy I can really appreciate you using Laguna Seca Blue 💙
Ok are we just not gonna talk about the phub sticker on his microwave????
Did your microwave had a pornhub sticker?
5:22 what is that song 🥲
The microwave 😂
Hey tanner are you interested in your garage floor getting polished? Let me know bro, I can come from Texas and give you a badass looking floor I can ever add color to it
Car looks great bro! Great job
Where maverick been ?
what the actual fuck is this 🤮
🚘🚘🚘awesome ❤❤❤
Call it “MYSTIQUE” like X-men !!!!!!!!!!!!!👍👍👍
In my country It’s all fun and games until you come across a pothole .
bro you smashed this one that's really good
One thing bro u know how to costume a car
Love the quality of this video, those b-roll shots tho🥰
What does this kid do?!
Damn am honest look way better before with yellow and the wheels it had but still looks fire for sure
I used to hate ur lambo but now that’s FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The car looks good enough to be in need for speed and forza horizon
Why so low..?
I like it more than the GTR 💯
Song at 11:00?
Anyone see the microwave!!
Sheeesh. Clean dis my dream car 🚙 cool 😎🤤😱😂🥳
Full opinion- definitely out did the gtr but I was a fan of the chrome wheels and the yellow but overall it isn’t bad
I like that he didn't go super flashy with it like most kids these days. I love the colors and the pattern
I can't believe he still does the youtuber kinda clickbait bs he didn't get a new lambo just new wrap idk why you wouldn't title real then wtf is emotional about it you ain't crying kinda weak and lame to fake a title
Sorry original color was better i think.. body kit is cool
killer lambo 👍👍
Dope asf
Looks amazing Tanner!
Looked better yellow with the old rims
Damn Tanner what a beautiful color your Lambo is #1, Hot as Hell. Missed seeing it on your channel,stay safe YOU can see the horse power in your face AWESOME .
Ok, but hear me out, bone stock Miata 👀
Congrats bro
Tanner I need at least  2 of your vids per week pls 🔥🔥🔥
This thing feels so much more solid then the gtr, like mechanicly the gear changes and everything sound so much more like 'reliable' if that makes sense! Looks fucking sick tho, i love it!!
Can y’all imagine if tanner fox teamed up with savage garage, and they went for a long car driving car show.
Its cool to see justin bieber doing youtube now
I loved the Lambo before but now?  OMFG!  That is the coolest Lambo I have ever seen.  Now drive it to Minnesota and take me for a ride.  -20 below zero right now so bring gloves and socks.
Shits ugly asf😂
Say oh my gosh
It’s really nice. But how much are the payments on that
Looking fantastic 😎👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
3:22 forgot to blur license plate
Bruh the orange looked better and the bbs rims where nicer
Imagine t fox lambo vs dde lambo vs choi lambo🔥🔥🔥
So fkn SIC bro
Yo who’s music is that cuz it’s FIRE
FYI the frunk or front bumper has a big gap on the passenger side when accelerating. Idk if it’s not latched all the way or the frunk is flexing or the bumper is moving and flexing.
Love the car hate the wheels
you just looks like justin bieber
£20?
Sauciest
raposa curtidora
Bugatti divo vibes ❤️❤️❤️ paint work says it all
Didnt even start the video and already hit the like button. I'm excited.
As crazy as this sounds but.. Every other YouTuber is modifing Lamborghini's.. it's getting boring and repetitive... Change it up get a couple mercedes, SLS AMG or an AMG GT.. haven't seen anyone really do anything with a range rover SVR...
5:21 song?
Okay, cool. Now build a civic to beat it
I did not buy myself a Christmas gift
BUT THE GTR IS THE.    OOOOGGGGGG
nfts are dumb
song at 5:20 ?
You should of kept it stock I'm sorry but it looks ugly that body kit is hideous and the wrap just doesn't fit it right.
Not gonna lie I would have loved it if you would have just got some type of purple on your cars blue or green just looks ugly it looks ugly purple's words at you should've got a beautiful purple type of color color on your shit But you went with blue out of all colors green and blue
Song ?
Tanner,, hear me out!! Custom carbon fiber wheel.
love the p.rn sticker on the microwave lol
Are we going to talk about the sticker on his microwave
looks fire broski not better than the r35 tho
Bro really downgraded
U should Hydro Dip the NFT
Just remember that I subed at 2.82 mil subscribers and we are the one who got you that nice lambo so thank us in some of your vids that money and life style ur living is from are support just remember that….
What’s the Song from when he did the b roll in the ware house?
You make great car content. I love it
the car looks amazing. i’m not a fan of massive wings on any car personally, but the lambo looks great man
Mexico looks beautiful especially at full send.
Go back to user she have a little bit of a blue stripe around the edges of the Diffuser and the rear fin on the very very top would be sick.
looks sweet!!!! i think the wheels were worth the wait too
Looks insane!
brooo thats sick not sicker than the gtr tho thats my dream car
1:45 LOOK AT TANNER MICROWAVE 😂😂
Broooo!!!!!! That wrap is so fireeee💥💥 you did it again tanner your a fuckin  legend
The mircowave😂😂
Congrats on the lamborghini reveal.❤‍🔥💯
I liked this video.👍 (I punched the notification bell) I hit that subscribe button.
That looks so sick you should name it the blueberry
Respect for a guy from Czechia 🙏🏼 Bro how does you get to Tanners car
Congrats!! Something a little off with just the look of rear tire opening, not sure if it's tire fitment but still an epic spec
Man that looks fucking insane
Be careful with those star light roofs, seen too many people have their cars and trucks burn to the ground because of them.. would hate to see that happen to a Lambo..
Star line roof beats moon roof.
Yellow looked better in my opinion
Very cool, when are you gonna get the Bugatti…….
Ta okleina😍! Jedna z lepszych jakie widziałem
Only tanner could make that car look worse
So glad you love the car! not my personal taste but still sick!
needs a GINTANI flame tune bro❤🙈
Looked so much better before in my opinion but still looks beautiful man, congrats on the success 💯
I lowkey like this one better than the GTR, congrats bro. That car is crazy!
Bro the Lambo in my opinion beats the gtr, that thing is 🔥
From one creator to another...that's sick! Congrats . I aspire to be like you
Congratulations on the new whip bro, it's an absolutely beautiful car!!! You deserve all the great things coming your way, you've worked so hard for it all. Just know, you being a young guy that has a car like this, there's going to be haters out there that will say mean and rude things just to piss you off. Just ignore these trolls and continue doing what you're doing, there's nothing you can say or do to make these trolls happy. Their simply lazy people that want things handed to them and not work hard like you have.
The GTR WILL FOREVER BE ICONIC
Ngl wheels were a huge let down the other ones we way better I was expecting sum hardware in them or sum wrap looks great tho
Just Imagine if he had a blue and a yellow one
Gebt dem Bubi mal was zu essen! Der sieht ja schlimm aus und ein Haarschnitt wäre auch mal angebracht
CLOCKED IN
You need ar here cot bro 😂😂
vcfgbhnjmk, bnhgjuyity7u8i9oikjnm
can tell how this will end enjoy while ya can
That’s definitely the best looking Lamborghini on the planet
Godzilla killer ???
I think we all knew it was blue cuz of the merch
Don’t forget to pay the tax man .
I wish my mom would buy me a Lambo........
knows absolutely nothing about it
yellow was better imo😫
Big mistake not running cup 2’s. There’s no way 4S’s can handle all that power safely.
I thought this guy was all about showing off but I realise now that he is humble 🔥💯
He is back 🔥
What are naming the lambo
Dude Tanner I say gauczilla looks a lot better but the lambo looks good
What is the song name of the first little edut
Lame content!
Bro! Congrats, it looks so sick!
Nice car. Please do not: Drive Drunk Drive Angry Drive into a wall  I have never heard of you tanner but dont crash and most of all dont endanger others on the road. You can afford a toy like this that means you can afford track time to really lay into it.
i hate my michelins lol, cant stop spinning in them. I preffer Pirelli P zeros
You need to have a 3 way race with #DDE and #AlexChoi
nobody is gonna talk about the microwave 😂
I can offer you 140,000.
THIS IS THE SEXIEST CAR I'VE EVER LAID MY EYES ON
Who are you?
This vid needs a second comment, Such A Beautiful Car Slick As!
Very impressive!
Tanner looking like Bieber TF🤣😁💪😯
How original.. another YouTuber with a modified Huracan. Its getting old, not just the car, but all the videos out there that are basically the same.
Yo is that even the same car it looks sick
Holy this definitely did our do your gtr 😍🤩
WAITED ALL DAY FOR THIS, WORTH ALL THE WAIT. CONGRATS TANNER!!! <3
tanner looks like he finally started puberty
Wish I was rich..
Sickkkkkk build!!!! More car content please 👌🏽🔥🔥
Top car boss Send me some pics of your car I make a video

Did anyone else see the cool sticker on the microwave?
12:40 Half yellow, half blue looks pretty sick
Tanner u should wrap the Tesla purple if u still have it with the matte black that be sexy af
Czech faam🙋‍♂️
Brooo name the lambo the blue zilla
This grown ass woman’s dad bought her this?
It's in your mom's name clown
Another spoiled brat! I’m so impressed………. Not!
At last! After all the waiting and problems you’ve finally got a stunning car, enjoy driving it.
Pull that star lit sh#t out
Congratulations. She sounds mean! Enjoy. You look great in it!
for all the big car guys imagine he tucked rears😳
Your Hurucan has to meet Alex Choi!
Annoyingly applied
Do you still live at home with your parents?
Justin Bieber wanna be?! 😂
Did you get a 1 of 1 booster seat so you can see over steering wheel?
Personally don’t like the wrap. Everything else is mint tho
anyone see the sticker on the microwave at the beginning
Congrats It looks straight up fire bro
jdms are better
Why the fuck is YouTube sending me all these YT kids with a bunch of shit people can't afford? What? Am I supposed to fall in love with these YT family lives or something.   No one gives a fuck
Im your new hater lol nah jk congrats 🤙🏾
Well done 👍 That car is damn stunning in blue and black and wheels is awesome too and don't forget inside off roof is amazing how change 3D viewing modes and features off it.Tanner 👍👍💯💯
Tanner i’ve been watching for eight years and God you haven’t changed a bit Love your videos man maybe one day I’ll be able to ride with you but I live 12 hours away

Wow that’s so fire!!🔥🔥🔥 This needs to be a hot wheel!!!
Best car wrap out straight up

This just proves Money can't buy class go ahead call me jealous..wrong!
All I can see is a king cobra snake when I see the front of the Lambo...that had to a major inspiration.
Yoo do a vid with stradman in your lambos ,  it looks 🔥🔥 by the way
SHEESH MANEEE 🔥
Big congrats dude!!
New subbie here! 👋
😍
Unpopular opinion: The Lambo > GTR
How do these millionaires get their hands on 1 of 4 cars? You would think these are reserved for billionaires
Love ya vids bro
Yo sick
damn bro, you legit cried over a lambo?
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Ngl not feeling brushed black
Oh omg it looks amazing🤘
Love it but honestly would look cool if the calipers were the same blue
very happy youre doing so well in life man...but have you ever thought what if china invades taiwan and you're drafted into the army to fight in ww3? would you run or would you go to bootcamp and then go to war and fight in the most brutal war of all time and leave all these nice things behind?  it is america that gave you the opportunity to have all that and have the life you got...the liberty the life and the pursuit of happiness...you are the epitome of the american dream being lived...you have no idea how special that is  could you do it and leave it all behind and fight ww3 or would you run to canada or mexico?  china is about to invade taiwan soon...what have you done to prepare for war with china and the communist chinese party? anything? it might take place right after olympics...very soon here the waters around taiwan will be calm and will be the best time for china to invade if they do...only a few times in the year is the waters calm enough for full scale invasions...so they have to go soon or wait like a year to do it...xi is in his late 60s and needs to fulfill his crazy plans that he keeps talking about in his crazy speeches like hitler did...  do you know anything about any of this? the weapons china has? the training they go through?   im saying all this because i care and not being a condescending douche...like i legit care because i want you to live this happy life and have these things and live that american dream and not die in a stupid war...but it looks inevitable  so if youre going to fight...i want you more prepared than any generation before you and not the one generation that is the least prepared...you have all this money and resources and connections that you could do something significant to fight this in whatever capacity and find a way if their is a will to prepare the best any generation has ever prepared for...  you have that ability no other generation before you had and yet seem to be the least prepared, as of right now, for all out world war....that doesnt add up...something is causing that like ccp doing weird stuff...  you can figure this stuff out and get into it and dissect it and really blow this open for your generation and scare the living f out of china which might actually make them deter from invading all together...if they see american youth doing something   thucymides trap or whatever they call it...id hate if you had to go to war and then die instantly in the first minute of battle in a brutal way...that would tear my heart apart...  so i ask again? what have you done personally to prepare for that and make sure if it happens you dont die? running wont help...the chinese will eventually land on our soil and make you fight...so either its fighting in the pacific or here on our soil if we all just do nothing...  things are about to get real here real fast son...i pray for all you young boys..i want you to live your dream lives and be happy like you are all now...life liberty and the pursuit of happiness...the uni party phqd youre generation so hard but you wont know it until this ww3 kicks off soon and droves of you die like ww1 trench warfare  i hope these words and comment did something in you....because what you do could actually prevent ww3...like im serious man...just you and what you do even that small is actually quite significant and could lead to preventing it...or at the very least delaying it so you can prepare even more!
Bro so fucking sick prolly one of the most badass cars I’ve laid eyes on
🇨🇿🇨🇿
I wish u put black in the front and. Fade to blue or yellow
I wrote faded color and it’s 💰👍🤜
This car is so sick, I love the colour combination ! Congrats Tanner
See this before it dropped on the club but god damn this car is sexy🔥🔥
#20 On Trending ✅
Beautiful car like the deep dish rims more but it’s sick still
Ejjjjjj 10:30 i am from czech republic , czech brother👍👍👍👍😎
Tanner bieber?
Yes they go together so good l
We'd really love to see your car collection really.
😧....another "object referral " video.....why was this recommended? ??
Emotional.. bitch please. What was emotional was when u bought your "BRO" a Jetta for his first whip then trashed it 10 minutes later. Be a bit more creative and loving with your content. Stop being a douche! Peace
So much better then the yellow
Is it just me or do you sound different bro
congrats bro lambo looks dope
Richard Zelinka
Toyos are better
cost for the build video will get some views
As a JDM car enthusiast, I’m going to miss them BBS 3pc wheels 🥲
YouTube is so boring at the moment getting lambos lol talk about copying each other
sus sticker on the microwave 1:37
It’s so fire it’s a lot better than the GTR
getting a fancy car does not count as EMOTIONAL
You trying to be Bieber?
Awesome wrap and the rims are so sweet
Hi
did this guy just reallly pull off into dirt
I love you guys 🥵 so excited for this whole year of content
you gotta make a video with tj hunt and his widebody huracan!!!!!!
I know nothing about cars but I still enjoy Tanner's videos like this one. This car is beautiful and Tanner has a good eye for what works. I have a question about wraps: If moisture gets under the wrap, do you then have a problem with rust?
That's way better than the GTR wrap 🔥
Nobody cares
Congrats but the spoiler is not my taste. 👍🏻
Some clips i feel like came from new horza 😃
Support from Czech Republic 🤟🏻 lets gooo 🔥
The car looks good and all but i think it took way too much time 7 months for a wrap and wheels?
I FW THE FIT HEAVY♨️🔥
The new wrap is amazing
that boy too low
This lmbo is fire af 🤯🔥
They really should have continued the design that's on the door onto the roof to get the fading look. the roof is just bare to me but to each there own. That's the only thing I would change sweet car bruh
Its looks sick! Im just glad it doesn’t look like a JDM anymore.
I didn’t like the GTR wrap but this one looks sick

Where is your Toyota ?
U should make a intro with the new cars
Sorry not sorry what a fucking sexy car!! I got Bugatti vibes Here with the color ways :)
Broooooo. That lambo looks sick as hell. Definitely my favourite out of the two
sexy is an understatement
Michelin NOT the oldest but one of them 1884. The oldest is Continental AG 1871. Great vlog mate. love the Lambo.
You got a race shradmans pink Aventador now
Prefer the old wheels tbh
Guaczilla vs WanborWeenie which will you choose and which will win in a race
This car is freaking beautiful 😍
you should get a nice flame tune for your lambo tho, that’d be awesome to see it spit flames down the freeway
5:23 song name ??
Nah it's ugly I like the GTR more
Love the LAMBO! Tanner, I need to know. Where do get alllll your money? Please tell me! Inquiring minds want to know😊 Lot's of love always💕

Tuffest Lamborghini right now 💯💯💯 loving the colour 👌
Did I heard Czech Republic :O
You give me the money I would’ve built a better car than that and the fucking brake calipers should’ve match the front end of the car anybody can build a car if they have all the money to do it
Yellow calipers would have made it look better it would pop so much
One of the best Lamborghinis out can’t complain I love it

In my humble opinion it looked better the way you bought it
Holds the title of best cars on YouTube 🐐

Hands down best wrap ever tbh it outdid the gtr
Alex Choi where you @ 👀🤷‍♂️
I liked the yellow a lot better :( it look so much more clean
Damn bro what’s the sticker on the microwave hahahahaha
💲💲💲❗✔🦊
The color and fade compliment the look of the car so it looks like cold air flowing along with the power that makes you feel like you gotta pull your sack back out from between the top and bottom of the seat
That Lambo is beyond sick
The only thing I’d change about the car is maybe a darker blue but I like the blue o tot a lot to
can someone tell me which song was that 2:21
It is so dope
I wanna Live your life :) love this ... Slovakia :)
I hope hot wheels and you collaborate on these because I wanna add them to my collection
This is amazing love it
Looks SO SICK
Yo tanner love it. But I personally dogged the yellow it made it pop and it flowed better with the car too IMO. But this is dope too. Definitely would have the old deep dish wheels
The car is great but the sticker on the microwave 😐
tanner looks like Justin Bieber
That lamb is beautiful Berrzila like blueberry cause it’s blue

Not tanner putting the nft on the drum pad
Look man I don't even like Lamborghinis but I absolutely love yours that b**** is off the chain

What is the song name for the little edit
F I N A L L Y!!!! yo the lambo is frfr the best build you’ve ever done (even if you didn’t do any of the build, you bought it basically done) no doubt it’ll be hard to compete with it. she’s sooo sexy! congrats tanner you deserve it!
You should’ve done a top flow exhaust it would’ve made it shoot flames
the sticker on the microwave made me stay for the whole vid haha
Should’ve painted the brake calipers BLUE…
That makes the gtr look like a bitch I love it man
Hi
Get a toyo R888 tire
Mans could get walked by some many other cars with 3/4’s the price
thats cleaan
🤤🙌🏼That Huracán is NEXT LEVEL!!!!! 🤤🙌🏼

Nah bro u has to take that lambo wit #stradman lambo the pink they will be look ma good together ❤️‍🔥🙏🏼
very nice
you need a back fire tune on this car
You should race alex choi now
u bought huracan with most powerful audi r8 engine and absolutely is sick
Car looks sick bro, but adding blue lines on the edges of the black bumper would have looked pretty cool. Something like the Lamborghini Centenario.
Lamborghini boys 🥵 Sheeeeee ❤️‍🔥

Pros and cons about the lambo and gtr. Then a race between both cars
But bro the gtr was on ur yt for longer
Beautiful. Just take it easy, bags on an exotic is dangerous.
That's amazing I'm OG and I'll say it looks better the the gtr
Yo tanner. Haven't watched your vids in a while. Glad I clicked on this one though. Love the style. Keep up the good work. Big year for you.

“Catch me in the Club” -Tanner Fox 2022
Sold the house for a Lambo?
Hardest in the game no cap🔥🔥
thats the cleaanest lambo ive ever seen in my life dude congrats man
looks pure shite to be honest
TFox vibes always dope content keep up the good work love the videos...
That thing is CRAZYYY🔥🔥
it was better before ngl...
Alex Choi is better
I'm pretty sure Alex didn't cut them by himself the machine did 😂🤣🤪
It's a spaceship
So much better then that yellow I love it!  Great job all!
bro this is the sickest car i have ever seen
#nofocksclub saw it first! And I'm still so hyped! Great video🔥🔥🔥
🤮sick as you like 👍🏻👊🏻✌🏻🇬🇧Adam aka Azzy 👊🏻
I really think you should get a hellcat in the Collection
I've been waiting for this
His microwave
have to race the stradman now
you poor kid you have no money to eat
Congrats bro! Laguna Seca blue is a solid choice!!!
I'd put hydronic or air lifts on it just so if you have to go done and bumpy road you don't screw it up
Why does tanner look like Justin beber
Song 5:22
not even a minute in and i dont wanna watch anymore....i didnt have enough money to get anything for christmas
I think I like the GTR better, the black back on the lambo doesnt quite do it for me, I think that backend would look better with something glossy. I preferred the Yellow.
is it a sto?
Literal copy of Gigi’s spec lol  Looks🔥 tho
Soooo happy your posting again
Definitely like the Lamborghini color.
Honestly prefer the yellow
This better be a hotwheels along with guaczilla 3.0
I love it are you going to take it out to car shows
👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️
1:14 microwave 😳
Tanner you  should race the  Lamborghini and the GTR
Throw some blue on the wheels
This kid has been 14 for 17 years.
Idgaf what one says, The lamb looked 100x better in all yellow.
It looks kinda like a SVj now
U vs Alex Choi🥱💯💯💯
https://youtu.be/W6WmkHCs-y8
From a 1 of 1 lambo to a 1 of 4... how does that work?😂
What’s the song at 10:52?
No Christmas gift broke broke broke😪
Ngl the old wheels look way better
The one thing that dissapointed me a little bit is how the front emblem was yellow like i think they could have wrapped the emblem as well but otherwise full repsect to the car
What lenses did you get?
That car is fucking crazy
A build isn’t a 1 of four
7k for lenses that make you look like skeletor.
what happened to the podcast
The old wheels would be better
photo shoot with Alex Choi plz 😆
gotta let damon fyre do donuts now and go down rodeo with him on dde
TFOX vs DDE soon, we'll definitely love that
Dam that car looks Awesome
So clean🔥 best build U have done
tanner how old are you
alex choi and tanner should do a collab wit both lambos
Yeah well I have a Volkswagen..
Tanner always ruins it with the weird wraps but sick car nevertheless
Looks sick 💚it😀
So clean
Tanner should make it spit flames on command and meet up with Choi. That would terrorize the streets
You should name it blueberry
Looks good but I prefer the yellow
Cant believe I’m saying this. I liked the yellow better. This is cool but doesn’t have the same effect
Looks INSANE!!
Lol Yoo I use that same $110 kit! 🤝🤝🤣
Man threw up a actual gang sigh
Don’t betray the gtr 😭
Let's go Tfox, you look fucking good my dude. Let's smash 2022, can't wait to see what you have in store!
This lambo is the craziest i`ve ever seen
So what makes this 1 of 4? Someone let me know😩
i love the blue thats my favorite color and i think i like it more than the GTR 3.0
Not gunna lie. When you first got the Lambo, I wasn’t a fan of if. But now?! That shit is clean AF!
Crazy how these kids have so much wealth
My boy out here making moves 💪😍
Wow what a car love it keep up the great work tanner
You need to do a collab with Alex choi
Love the microwave
this isn’t 2016 anymore don’t need to put emotional in the title
ok those wheels are sick as fuck i hate lambos but damn
Congrats this things nicest car I’ve seen and god damn those rims r Crazy
why does your microwave have a hornpub sticker on it 💀
I remember when you took them to get it wrapped you said you wanted to do a yin n yang concept but the blue so much better then the green
That look fresh asf
Ok but that is the dopest wrap on YouTube..
thx for the free NFT
Love the microwave sticker
Do you still ride scooters?
So worth the wait!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
That’s gorgeous😍
Excited to see Tanner continue uploading twice a week the entire year. I want to see what you can get to Tanner.
Hey fox fam let’s encourage tanner to give the guys at autoamour a small prize.
Gintani exhaust
Loved the colors it's so great happy new year to a it is like your Xmas present have a great day drive safe lot of.power
yesss tanner uploadss yayy
Congrats bro🙏🏾
I think the car looks good. But lambos and spoilers don’t go well together. No sports luxury cars deserve spoilers maybe on some but it don’t go well tbh
Happy late new year t Fox 😅
Looked way better yellow and I'm not a huge fan of yellow. It just  fit that car so well.
I honestly like the yellow and the old wheels
That thing went from "Big Bird" to "Danny Phantom" real quick!!
Now race jake paul
That wrap design is nasty 🤮🔥🔥🔥🔥. ( in a good way)
So, "Pure Design" supports Nazi domestic terrorism? Another 3% symbol on that truck that is well-known for every atrocity toward anyone not white.
Steele 11 always comeing in the that 🔥
No offense why do u look like Justin Bieber with the hair and the little beard
Yep it beat the GTR this looks fire
Looks 10 X more badass now.
Yo tanner what’s the song when you were showing the car
I loved the yellow and white.. but I’m not disappointed with this blue and black it looks amazing!
It is better the n the gtr
Dude glad see it done hope see more vids
Jeez man your new lambo is tough
Looks amazing
Emotional
The car’s beautiful! I’m a huge fan of the podcast and would love some more episodes?
Congratulations on the new livery
Looks soooooooo much better than the yellow 🥶
Well worth the wait homie! Hands down the sickest color/graphic combo on a lambo ive seen
461th lol
Looks pretty fresh tanner, nice choices
If these children make this much money from Youtube, I wonder how much YouTube itself is worth
No one gaf
Wish I was wealthy like him
Car looks amazing Tanner
that orange lowkey wouldve been clean too but the wrap looks amazing !
Whats the name of the song at 10:53 i need it cuh it sound fire 🔥
I like the wrap.  I think it's perfect.   Same design but perfect color for the Lamborghini.
so good man, just one thing, the brake calippers should have been blue
Nice video
you have zero taste
May I make you Lamborghini in Florza hero Zens 4
Yo Tanner can you include the music you use?
Not gonna lie, this car looks gay af lol
Looks terrible 😂 looks like the put a homemade plastic rear bumper on it. Reminds me of the early 2000’s when like 16 year olds use to put those massive body kits of shitty mustangs.
I took me till the 6 min mark to realize he wasn’t getting four Lamborghini
I’ll give you 3k for the nft
So sick
Id buy a hatchback civic if i was 16
Easily THE Best Lambo If Ever Seen
First time back , since you stopped Riding scooters
Really gonna hate airbags real soon. So unreliable
I love it!!!
5 bucks
i wish i had 7 grand
I dig the previous wheels better. Wish you just repainted it.
SEMA :l
Now you and Choi need to get together band rip to canyon roads!
SIMA ????
Bro thanks now I own an nft
I like the wrap idea but imo it would’ve been better all blue cause the blue is a sick color
it looks bad ass
waited 7 months for "those" wheels?🤷‍♂ 🤣
Looks good bro 😎
anyone else slow down the montage and see all the bubbles in the wrap and the smudges in the wheel paints?
ok it's cool yea and great job but... why the lambo
Been waiting for this🔥
Bro one thing you need to get done is put some carbon canards on front n rear with the blue pin stipe on edge,
The lambo looks like some kind of beast ass shark. I'd name it deep blue or something like that lol
That’s pretty sick 🥵
No one beating tanners car collection!! #Facts
Tanner the Lambo looks fire
Had to add the classic (emotional) LOL
Took me a while to realize that this is what used to be the yellowwww!!!!!!!!
POV we screenshot his nft
I'd still pick the GTR over the Lambo.
Cool u got a rare lambo no gives a fuck
WAITED ALL DAY FOR THIS, WORTH ALL THE WAIT. CONGRATS TANNER!!! <3
What’s the song @5 min
OK Lamborghini looks 10 x better than just the boring yellow and amazing videos
The rims are sick But it should've been more bucket
Not a Bugatti, smh 😔
What a waste of money. People are starving, that car could feed a country for a day
Wheels are trash
Sick
Tanner got a awesome taste in cars sick ass cars
apart from the car dude i just wanna say you look good man. these videos feel more personal and we get to see more of actually you, how you work and think. Here’s to a bless 2022 my guy, ride it.
To the one who is reading this: I hope everyone is    enjoying the new year and had a blessed day today and will have one tommorw❤️
You are so sweet of
The sticker on your microwave is a bit weird for a microwave
That two tone looks Dope brother I love it man also looks like the batmobill from the back
I honestly cannot imagine a better livery for the Lamborghini Huracan  and GTR r35. Looks phenomenal👌🏻👌🏻. Those two together are going be the coolest duo ever and the best matching duo ever. Keep up the good work and the amazing content.
Pls cut it
omg it looks so sick. I much prefer the new wrap over the yellow. You must be so happy to finally have it back!
Riced
Cut your hair
Absolutely sick color and wrap. Love it!
I love the black and blue great combo and the fade from light blue to black is on point great job Tanner.
That blue looks so good!! Need to change gtr color green is getting old. Incredible car good stuff
Need Toyo Proxes triple 8s
Race Alex choi
I think that wheels could be little bit bigger 🥶 but it’s only my opinion, the wrap it’s cool AF
Bro the Lamborghini looks sick
Oh.... baby lambo go skrtttt
Must be nice not having to work for money just get it handed to you from YouTube ha
Sexiest thing I’ve ever seen
Wow the lambo is a peace of artwork the wrap is sick I love it.
New Lambo is pretty sweet dude. Doesnt the GTR still feel a lot more powerful?
thats one of the sickest carwraps i have ever seen
Def a good look making the lambo look ur own, way better than the yellow
nice whip, but all his wrap looks the same. From GTR to the. lambo. I'd choose a diff wheel tbh 😅
Alex Choi lambo is better
I haven’t watched the channel in forever.. but when did he his voice change and no longer like a mouse
Can you send it to India🇮🇳 bro
You seemed a little scared. Don’t be the next Paul Walker. Fans miss him to  much.
Congrats tanner :)
It's  the same wrap as the gtr  but the gtr    wrap is green and this one is blue  is   hella sick
What's the song called at 11 mins and sumn seconds ya ??
This car looks evil 👹
Not really a big fan of the wheels
that lambo hard aab. way better than the gtr 😂
I love the new Lamborghini it amazing
Been looking forward to this for a long time!!
The Lambo looks sooo sick Tanner!
Yellow was better ngl
The lambo looks like a monster 🔥🔥🔥
Hi tanner fox
I got the same starlight rooftop
I have a boner.
One speed bump will end that car
Dope 🔥
hello
That slammed
Those rolling shots were epic loved it
🔥🔥
The Front is nice the Back is ... OK.  The wheels are Vers nice.  I Don t Like the black im tne Back. But nice Care. Greats
Dude your irrelevant
We need to see a gt34
LOOKS GREAT!!!! congrats Tanner keep doing reveal videos neon blue my favorite
Hub adapter
Bro the lambo looks so good
Owner of Opeliteoptics: Thanks for the love man! Loved working on the Lambo 🙌
Yessirrr
bro you have one of if not the best duo
bruh
the bull berry
What is the name of that song 10:52
Song at 5:23?
What is the song that starts at 9:38
nice
Looks good 👍🏼  But I prefer your old wheels even if you were to paint them black
I got those tyre's on my Holden 🤣
i dont lke how it looks
10/10 wrap
new turbos and a different exhaust style tho that would be fire
You got 4??
mans looks like justin beiber
Looked better with the chrome wheels shoulda kept them and just make it matte black like im the wrap🤙🏽
This is just my opinion. But matte blue on the front and gloss bardo gray in the back would have looked insane
Congrats DAMN, strad will be jealous of this lol see if his veyron can beat this :) not unless if he get's the chiron...
Earlyyy
Holly havent expect that a lambo could look like that. tbh i would anything to take a ride in this Monster. Nah Not anything but uk what i want to say. :3
Blue dragon 1.0😁😁
🔥🔥
Most definitely should turn the Lambo into a widebody Lambo
The wheels don’t look good on the Lamborghini
Woooow looks like it came straight out of Need for Speed Heat
When scooters
Daaaaamn son that car is legit!!!!!! Congrats bro. Gtr is also not to shabby. Here’s to a bangin 2022 (🎉) for you and your subs. ✌️
the best lambo i have ever seen
cheers
Tanner starting to look like JB in that pink  hoodie and beanie
give you 10$ for the nft
Came out super dope
The front end gives me centanario vibes
Lol.  Hi tanner.     Tanner gang.   🤪🤪🤪🇦🇺🇺🇸
Sell everything and get a SVJ
you and tj should have a photo shoot with the lambos they both look rad af
I am not a prophet but If You're Seeing This Post, You Shall Never Beg To Survive..🙏🙏
Fox 🦊 shauodhed
I don’t like how you raped the gtr:( Buy the lambo came out dope tho
The small details that the shop did are really nice and make the lambo unique 😎
You ruined the car
Yo can y’all help with funds  My mama doesn’t have money she lost her job?  Y’all ain’t force too But am just asking for help ?
The car look sick sick sick sick sick
#Razzilla
Looks like the gta car zenterno
Bro that’s sick enjoy
the pornhub sticker on the microwave lmfao
🥶💨
blue and green oue my favourite colors but i like yellow better on this car. but its nice
That looks so crazy tanner you've done such a good job with the Huracanand  guaczilla, guaczilla looks amazing both of them look perfect can't wait to see them together in a picture
This is what it looks like when you never had a real beater car, or even a car that costs less than 10k.
I love it your the best!
Congrats Tanner
Tanner your Lamborghini looks so sick it looks way better than it looked before
Get darker window tint
You need to do a video with your huracan and the stradman widebody aventador that would be sick!
Need to have DDE come rip donuts in the new garage like they did the drive way.  Break it in
Early!!! CONGRATS!!! This car is stunning!!
YEAH!!!💯💯💪💪👍👍
MUCH nicer in that wrap. The black helps take your eyes off that strange rear fenders. Might be my favorite kitted lambo.
Car is stunning fire .
Absolutely beautiful congratulations. 😎🍻✌️
love the car but like i said plz ouder exshust
Some bigger turbos would be good!!!
🥵
4:39 tanners face lol
congrats dude. on a side note you should invest in some mics, or be a bit more attentive to the audio when editing if that makes sense? I had to change my volume like 12 times during this video
Congratulations Tanner on your Huracan build, nothing is better seeing a person turning a vision for their car into a reality, however you did ask for our opinions and I just wanted to put mine in (as a car rendering designer, automotive photographer, and a massive effing petrol head)    The kit looks so good…however the wrap, and the rims in my professional opinion makes the car look quite tacky and alot cheaper than what it is. The original rims were simple but matched the blunt but sharp and aggressive lines of the Huracan perfectly. They were not over the top or crazy and the simple brushed aluminium made it look raw and stood out perfectly. The new rims are just a little too sharp and just plain for my taste, they would suit a F8 Tributo or a GT3RS perfectly but the Huracan not so much (maybe it’s just the colour of the rims with the kit and the wrap all combined into one.  The original version with the Giallo Midas metallic paint when you first bought it made the car look classy, clean, and complemented the lines of the kit beautifully, the new wrap with the awkward pattern, the two colours, and the multiple types of vinyl wraps from brushed to glossy, and matte makes the car look confusing to people who look at it. They wouldn’t know what to look at first. The reason why is because the kit is so aggressive that the wrap personally takes away peoples appreciation for the actual art of the kit. The wrap makes it look like your doing too much on top of buying a Lamborghini Huracan (a really angry looking car) then doing a rare LBWK wide body kit (Makes it 3x more aggressive and sharp) then doing a controversial, outlandish wrap. Keeping it the yellow made it look more of a show car instead of a tasteless, cheap, gaudy car.   The starlight headliner also makes a very beautiful car look 3 x cheaper. It’s like putting under glow on a Pagani Huayra…they don’t match. They only go with Rolls Royce’s in my opinion (I have seen RDB LA put one on a MAYBACH S680 and it goes really well with that so I guess what I’m trying to say is that the headliner only goes with luxury cars…not sports cars).   But congratulations on the completion of your build. At the end of the day it’s your build and your choice on what you want so congrats on that point…I’m more of an elegant, classy, clean type of person but your more of a YOLO go big or go home type of person so I understand your mindset.
Personally I would’ve kept the old wheels
yo how am i this early
Remember to warm up those tires before putting your feet down fully
FIREEEE BROOOO!!!
It's crazy🔥🔥
Damn
Bruh
First Tuesday of many videos to come 🤯 can’t wait for what’s coming !
Do the hundred dollar bill Challenge lol 😂 put it on your dash and see who can grab it!
Shot Tanner! Looks sick! Looking forward to more content and seeing you continuously grow 🔥
Personally I don't like the chrome on the wheels but the rest is👌
This is gonna be his year!! Remember it
u have to geet a louderr exhust plz
Let go
Ayo what's on that microwave
Would take the lambo over the Gtr man…looks sick🤙🏾
Tanner put some neon on your cars
🥶🥶🥶
som jedidiny koho prekvapilo ze ten typek je z česka
Slap the bbs on it would look hella bettter with them
I love the car. It looks amazing
Love it 😍
I think it looks better than the R35 but really I'm just glad it's not that yellow anymore.  The yellow just made it look cheap IMO, now it's so much more refined and absolutely perfect with the blue!
It looks amazing but I really liked the yellow 💛
I like the mambo more
Yellow was horrible loos so. Much better
plaid
Up in mount laguna???
The Lambo looks ok but the gtr looks sooo much better than the huracan
Wait is that a lamborghini SVJ????
Who tf is this guy? A daddy's money boy? Like bro.    Annyways retro cars supremacy
It's the rims for me
WAYYYY better than the yellow, SO COOOOLLLL
Hit a tail whip in next video
Tanner, that looks do good love the colour combo and those wheels 🤤🤤🤤💪💪👌👌 and your reaction as the bulb progress was like a little kid in a sweet shop 🤣🤣🤣 I agree the TF -V12   as a name would be better
Tanner should paint a scooter the same color ass the lambo
Hands down best build uv done I like how it has a super clean and functional fitment
Love the car 😤🤍🤙🏻💙
That looks great the bast Lamborghini I saw in my life
Cleanest car on YouTube that goes so hardddddddddd
Anyone know what brand the clothes he is wearing is?
Who remembers back in 2021 when we heard about this 😂😂😂
you and alex choi should race hurracans
Gtr is better then the lambo . Lambo is actually kinda ugly with the kit an wing . Wrap is nice though .
Its awesome but he should have put blue calapers on it
Go on fastest car it’s a show every race there is 1 super car and 3 or 4 built sleepers
My guy tanner, that’s sick if you want to know a new car you can buy is a mini van and you should mod to be lowered and do the same wrap as the gtr and lambo but red and add a wing
OH MY GOD ITS BEAUTIFUL
The whole point of nfts was that they're online and not a physical object to collect lmao it's pointless now that it's an actual object😂💀💀
So no one is going to talk about the sticker in the microwave. 1:09
I like the wheels tanner
U should meet up with the hunt and put ur lambo next to his lambo that would be insane
You and Alex choi Def gotta race now
I like it👍
That car is cool bro
This car is soooooooo sick good job
Tanner that Lambo is a 10/10, I love it!
I don't think Tanner realises that we can see the new colour of the huracan in the beginning of the previous video 😬😬
New {❤️}-> old {❤️ ❤️ ❤️}
Turned out so good!
Awesome vlog bro.
hmm not a fan of the wrap on this one. don't know what it is
