Where do you see GME going to next???
Great explanation.
Well in my calculations in time 6:51 you not only lose your $100 invest. Because you you have to buy 10 shares for $20 each witch gives $200 of loss. Am I right?
Naked shorts are a high crime if you had a gov that was not totally corrupt.
Lol a company with no profits or dividend. You folks are being played so bad. I will short again, thank you. I made a ton the first time around shorting when it hit 340. I will short if it hits 120 this time around. Some of the dumbest advice I have ever heard. If the company had a chance one day for profit okay, but it does not. It is dying on the vine badly.
Blockchain technology will be able to address the current issues of naked short selling by requiring all borrowings to be covered.
Great video Umar!  My personal opinion is that GME will probably go up slightly due to the recent announcement that Robinhood was lifting its trading restrictions, but ultimately I think it will probably continue to fall as those hedge funds try to focus all their efforts shorting it back down.  Things are getting pretty intense.  I just posted a similar video on my own channel!
AMC short float has rose 40% since this video, wouldnt it go down if hedge funds were trying to get out of it?
Whats the incentive for a broker to lend stocks if they know a company like Gamestop's stock is going to go down? Why would they lend 100 shares @ $10 and want the 100 back when its @ $5 a share?
I'm almost ready to jump in on Monday and help fuck these hedge funds who fucked me and so many others in 2008-2009. But the part I'm really unsure about is: What's to stop the Gamestop executives from issuing tons of new stocks making themselves rich while letting the hedge funds off the hook in the process?
I really like your informative analysis. Keep going buddy !!!
Umar love the vids learned a lot from you. Thank you brother.
Hold the Line on #GME #AMC and #NAKD  Hold and buy hold and buy
So what happens if the retailers never sell? would the brokers create stocks from thin air? So did the brokers borrow the retailer's stocks and sold it for a short and trapped themselves? If some brokers don't have shares how can they lend it? what is going on in the world of day trading??
Stocks are good but i swapped and invested in forex and crypto I've been earning much from it
I looked at all the other videos on this from other experts and your explanation worked for me. The other guys were just entertaining and giving there opinion instead of saying how this worked. They were trying to paint Gamestop and Reddit as the bad guys but it looks like they just beat the big hedge funds at there own game. I subscribed
you had explained it very well sir. Great.
we like the stock
This man Umar had his sh#t go viral hahah
How high will GME go?
May I ask where can check short ratio now for GME ? Thanks
What about CLF? Steel prices and cash flows are rising. Short float - 14 %.
Where can I find shorting percentage in IG account?
This is so amazing man, you should do a video on the clearing houses role in this situation and the broker, I think that this is part of a much bigger scheme on RHs side.
Im late lol
So, the market is red because these guys who got shorted are selling their stocks to "cover their position" in the short? Or a natural correction of the market?
C0TT0NC4NDYTA if you want the real story
There will be movie made and we'll be part of it! :D
BRo, That was perfect.. watched so many videos but you made perfect understanding of whats going on and whats shorting . Thank you once again
Why has GME stalled?
Thanks Ashraf, you explained the shorting, short squeeze in simple and easy to understand manner.  All the best👍
GameSpot is absolutely not going to $1000. It's $100 stock max. Id cash out.
Hedge funds currently have 12 billion USD shorted against GME.  Everyone hold your GME!! HOLD!
I've been an investor and I can categorically say it has transformed my life positively😊😊  the widest thing to do is Investing in Forex and crypto.Let me give an instance,the $doge coin was at certain price but when Elon musk tweeted about it,it made over 400% profit within 24hrs,now imagine 400% percent increase of that money you can spare,believe me when i say generational wealth will be made from this year crypto bull run.
One needs an expert or trading agent so as to trade with the right strategy
LETS GET AMC TO THE MOON YOU IMBECILES THEY DESERVE IT BEEN GIVING US QUALITY MOVIE THEATER EXPERIENCE FOR DECADES NOW!!! AMC TO THE NEXT UNIVERSE GET HYPED BABY!!
So am I suppose to buy my stock and leave it there or do I have to buy and sell everyday
Out of the all the videos on you tube to understand ths gamestop situation only urs helped me understand ths stuff ..thnq.  ❤️
WHAAAAT???? Im a dumb fuck i didnt understand I dont even know what stock is
How Stocks Can Have More Than 100% Short Interest  Even without a naked short sale, it's theoretically possible for short interest to exceed 100%. The reason has to do with the nature of the short-sale transaction itself.  As an example, take a situation involving four investors. Annie owns shares of GameStop, and Annie and her broker have an agreement that allows the broker to lend Annie's shares to short-sellers. It lends them to Bob, who subsequently sells those borrowed shares short in hopes that GameStop's share price will fall.  An investor named Chris ends up buying those borrowed shares from Bob. However, Chris has no way of knowing that those shares have been borrowed from Annie. To Chris, they're just like any other shares.  More importantly, if Chris has the same kind of agreement, then Chris's broker can lend out those shares to yet another investor. Diane, another GameStop bear, can borrow those shares and sell them short.  In this example, the same shares end up getting borrowed and sold twice. The short interest volume these transactions add to the total is twice the number of shares actually involved.
watched a few videos - but this explanation was really good!
There's no question that the price will eventually revert back to its intrinsic value, (which is probably <$20) and then the Reddit bandits will cry foul and accuse the hedge funds of manipulating the market. Sour grapes really, because manipulation is exactly how they managed to get the price up to these ridiculous levels. Buying stocks out of spite isn't a wise investment strategy.
Best explanation I’ve found so far to understand shorting 👍👍👍
DOGECOIN
Love you brother nicely explained 👍👍💚
It's going 10k+
I watched several videos to understand what happened with GME, and this was the best one by far!
After the flipping fact... donkey!!
Shh! Man please
Hedge fund suicides will be at an all time high very soon
Eat the rich. Fuck the system. To the moon!
Looks like there is a huge systemic lapse in that both forward and short trading is allowed in the US which the SEC has not covered, due to which  hedge funds make huge profits on shorting.
Just today shit got wild!! went from + 400$ to 190$ to 497$ to 193$    oh yeah btw, *HOLD*
I feel like I really missed out. Damn.
Bro you in the know!!!. Going start follow you a little more closely
Everyone in this comment sec is pumping up their position😂
Thank you for making this video. I think the stock market is the new way of making money.
I still don't understand that concept. where is the money coming from?
AMC tomorrow 🚀🚀🚀
We’re getting AMC tomorrow.  Bank on it.  F the system for what they did today
Casino
Haha reddit go brrrr
Ah I see... /doesn't get it/
For those investors didn't get out early they have a huge margin vall otherwise the account gets wipeout
Thanks umar well explained.
Silly hood investors, Free FED money is only for the Big Boys.
Naughty sheeple, naughty sheep. Only us the overlords should make money. SEC please regulate these normal little men retail investors. Ring Ring hello my good friend Robin the Hood, can you shut down these guys trading please, they are giving us a serious pounding.
Can anyone please recommend me a book that would help me understand the information he’s speaking about in this video
I like the stock...no manipulation. But If you are looking for a digital asset where you can make maximum profits from bitcoin should be your top choice, presently bitcoin is worth $35k and is still going higher, investing in bitcoin now is the wisest decision to make.
Looking Good Billy Ray feeling good Louis .... LMAO
I was like dayyyyyum this guy can talk fast and has mad mouse skills, I'm impressed! Forgot I had youtube player on 1.5x speed.
Thank for the explanation! IT'S GOING TO THE MOON!
this is by far the best explanation.
The democrats and rinos will not lose money bet that. They will freeze trading and make new rules
NICE GOING #REDDIT #AMC #GAMESTOP #GME and more. Now do what Max Kieser told us in 2012! #Cornerthesilvermarket .   Wish they go for the heart of the matter.   That being the precious metals. Especially Silver.... 1980 Hunt Brothers corned the market in Silver... it went from $3 to $50 then the big boys crushed them. Hmm... The National Debt at the time $900B.   Today 41 years later Silver is $25 the National Debt is 30x higher yet Silver and Gold are true money like constitutional silver was prior to 1965. They took real money away from us in our money circulation and gave shitty paper, and tin can coins worth crap.  You wanna get them back #Reddit crush the Silver ETF and/or pyshical market because many know in the precious metals community and worldwide that "The Silver Bullet" is what kills the #wallstreetvampirebanks. Max Kieser said it and almost succeded in 2012.  Real money was meant to protect us small people from being fleeced and to hedge inflation. If I were you I'd buy all the Silver you can while it historically the cheapest it's ever been. The ratio of silver to gold coming out of an efficient mine is 8 to 1.  Yes 8 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold! BUT! Look at today's prices Gold $1864 and Silver $25.10.   Hmm 1864/25=74 to 1! Today silver is 9x cheaper in price than it should be even under the 140 years of precious metals price suppression.   Buy Silver there is absolutely no downside risk. It can't possibly get any cheaper than it already is.  In reality I don't like to mix God and money but at the end of the day it's his money, he created those elements for a reason.   Paper, derivitives and all these wall street schemes created by man and banker vampires are a racket and a financial trap for all the sheeple. All they have done in all these years is find 1000 ways to fleece us of our time energy capital and standard of living.   Buy Silver break the banks ! Do It! #buysilverbreakthebanks
Once you are done with GME, please help squeezing shorts from $RIG. they been manipulating it since october.

GME TO $1000
The Elites are losing billions of dollars. Screw them.
They will take GameStop off market. Get DOGE
Excellent video.  I would just like to say that the only thing that is missing is short interest definition.
Monopoly
Need a part 2 on this
Guys... buy Faron Pharma from lse..! you should study it Umar.
So buy for a short so you can make cash, that shit will crash
SNDL and NAKD?
HODL retards, HODL. Don't sell AMC or GME. Wait out the short - do that and we win BIG.
Great explanation!
gamestop has been screwing gamers over for years about time the branch out to screwing stock marketers
Wouldn't these hedge funds have been in a better position if they had simply set a Stop-Loss within the margin, to buy their position at a small loss before the price sky rocketed?  I presume they didn't consider an exit strategy because they believed their volume was enough to drive the price down.  In other words, it's not just that the WSB army stepped in, but also the hubris of the institutions themselves for engaging in risky trading behavior. They weren't forced into making bad plays, but WSB happened to prey on their high risk bad behavior.
nice, so far the best video explaining what is happening
Its 420$ now babe. ....HODL

I have been looking everywhere for a naked short selling example and you explained things so well. Keep it up!
Very poor video. Did not make any attempt to explain why this event is newsworthy and what's "different this time".
HOLD
I was so confused about this shit and all the memes. You are so good explaining markets. I am a forex trades and I can tell if I want to learn stocks I would join your fucking academy. Thanks homie. I saw you one time in 305 and you were so nice.
MAC is another one with short float over 50%
The fact that this video is trending just insane
Aw heck you done lost me

It's $324 right now😂
Is this short example for margin traders loans
Ooooo when they shut this down, people going to loose their shirts.  Be careful peeps.
Trending no 1
Isn't it a fault on the side of a broker? They should not borrow shares that they do not have. So past a certain point you should not be able to short.
UMAR you're HAF
This actually taught me more than my one month course in shool. Thank you!
buy naked brands group you wont regret trust me
Elon needs to shut his mouth before he gets jail time. This is why social media is bad for society, in my opinion.
My question is why are brokers lending stocks to investors to be shorted?
Explain in such a gud way ,, loved it bro keep it up 👍👍👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏

trash scam options course
I do not understand how the short float is at 150% ???  How can it be more than 100 ?
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Thanks Umar for your wisdom - I appreciate it. I wish I could be your student.
Good video Umar!
GME TO $1,000!🚀 THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN HISTORY! THIS WILL BE MADE A MOVIE!
Burn Americas ballet box America will burn your money printer!! Screwed Bernie now you can get screwed!!!!
But they haven’t covered tho so the increase is not necessarily the shorts covering
This is no longer about the share price! HOLD THE LINE!
The meme machine will move on to the next overshorted stock after GME busts, and then to the stars ✨
I feel like everyone in the comments already knows at least something of the stock market. I know absolutely 0, and I was still confused after this. What the heck... I just need to know if gamestop is making a comeback or if theyre scamming people out of money in yet another way. Cus if theyre gonna go under and liquidate, thats a lot of potentially cheap old games xD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YrnTbzuOWM explains it better from the recommended after this
This was awesome. Simple enough for a complete idiot and newbie who has never read up on stocks before to understand.
Nice video thank you
So they were attempting to insensitivize purchasing and that lead into a racket or?
I am hearing involvement of the feds and SEC about this phenomenon.  Not sure they can stop it completely  but it could gradually slow down the process.  Lets see how this plays out.  Correct me if I am wrong please.  But at the end of the day.  The moral of the story.  Don't short a company more then the shares are available.   Thats just dumb logic.
no one truly knows. people are trying to push this up but... as you can see. the public made the big suits mad. i think the SEC will halt trading on GME and let it fall. whatever you guys do. if you didnt buy in before the rocket. DO NOT buy in now. dont be FOMO. SEC caught notice of this and who knwos what theyll do
Nakd will be next GME... Just buy and hold. Don't sell.. Short interest keep on increasing.. if no one sells then It will explode above 100$. Just spread the message...
If you borrow shares how does the broker make money
Dude............................  it's a warning shot. The market will crash, because it is based on paper money, not true assets.
Thanks Brother
The gamestop I drove by a week ago was having a closing sale "Everything must go". There are 3 within a 5 mile radius but still, isn't it bad if they are closing?
this is confusing. I thought if you buy a stock then goes up you make money selling it off. so here, you owe money. You want it to go down so you have more value to sell off?
GME AMC🚀🚀🚀🚀
The top dogs who shorted the stock is now sharting.
Bro it was 2 $$$ in March.
Now do today.
Excellent video! Thanks !  Let’s go for AMC!! Buy early tomorrow
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Pre market tomorrow will be History in the making. Celebs, billionaire everyone is watching this! Umar is even trending on Youtube for Gods sake LMAO !
Just subscribed. We need to crowdfund this system and absolutely show the 1% that the people are in charge, not the other way around.
Thank you for your great explanation.. I was wondering what's happening to these stocks lately
I'm so sorry to say but your explanation is way far. First we need to know if your buying/selling stock or option. I guess your talking about stocks because you mention 10 shares with $10 where options have 100 shares. Next, I think it's good talk about excercising assigning your shares or contract.That would be good to further understand when working with our broker! But we all know that brokers have a margin requirement. Heck they can also close your account if they feel like it LOL! Even when we short a strike, our maximum lost does not have to be infinite if we use our risk management. When short, you can make money going down but also when it goes up, that's why we have short calls and short puts but that only for options. Well maybe I misunderstood but well, that's why where here to  help one another. But I tell you, finviz.com is a perfect tool when it comes to trading! But I really enjoyed your video and hope to watch more!
The establishment is going to find a way to fuck this up for us because they hate us
Amc next!!
$NOK 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So. We taking this to the moon or what
Such a good explanation thanks 😁
HOLD BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT SELL NOW, WE'RE ALL IN THIS!!!!!!!!
Man the diamond hands comments is no joke, each tick is easily 20% and it’s so volatile that trading apps crash when you try to sell lol.
Question is why  hedge funds or institutional investors short the stock despite of high risk infinite loss?
BIolase in the morning!!! Thanks for info!!!😁
Brill explanation bro
I am jealous people who made millions of dollars cash but not me
Shit $380 to what?
What is the long game in this situation? When do the shorts truly become a loss if they are forced to buy more stock themselves, basically what happens WHEN the bubble pops?
wsb went private, probably to prevent any legal action. New reddit "wallstreetbetsnew" copy and paste to everyone so they know.
You need to change your thumbnail to $10,000 my guy it’s going to infinite squeeze
Short Sellers are getting 2.6Billion Bailouts....i think this short squeeze will continue to go on above $400
AMC to the moon😂
$GME, $AMC, $NOK 🚀 🚀 🚀

$Ptotf will be the next big thing as I've heard, it will happen on friday. Be ready.
Do not Short AMC there is some talk of AMC on Wallstreetbets
It could also be 140% short interest because some long positions are required to be classified as shorts. TripleD explained in on benzingas premarket prep.
Awesome explanation. I'm sending this to my friends as opposed to trying to explain it myself.
Is it too late to buy?
Great video, You have a lot to offer, i'm looking forward to your next video
What happens after all the short positions are cleared? Will the stock prices go down again?
I bought 6 shares in amc on robinhood, so I don't have to worry about the calls or whatever?
Inovio Pharmaceuticals!!

The best explanation ever. thank you. I finally feel like I understand a bit of whats going on.
What website were you using?
Good
Bitcoin is The future, lnvesting in it now will be the wisest thing to do especially with the current rise
great explanation, i almost understood whats going on and ive had no prior knowledge.
Umar : "GME is 160$ today ". (this video did not age well, and its only 1 day and GME is at 380 now lol)
Great explanation and video. Thanks. F*** wallstreet. Friday when the options expire it will be a blood bath
This was a really good explanation. Thank you
The chatter on Reddit is that NOK is the next short squeeze.  Get it and hold on!
This reeks of the 2008 crash caused by market makers (or in the 2008 case, insurance firms) insuring MBS's with higher values than they actually had in their own bank accounts. Fuck em.
Just wait till people find out about Lipocine Stock and other Health ones. They are about to moon.

Goodluck liquidating it

Beautiful informative explanation! Thanks bro

Prophecy has been fulfilled.
Thank you, Umar Ashraf, very well explained.
wow just imagine you have this number in all red -$1,489,301  and hoping it will stop!   shorting always a bad idea. Cause, it like gambling.
i don`t get it .if i have 10$ in a share, you`re saying i should sell it for 9$ dollars doesn`t seem like i would make any money .1:09 you are saying i make money from losing money. hey lets be specific please?
Didnt they just double down to 250 ?.... They really fucked up.
9 am central time around 300$ gme
Just discovered your channel!  Love the way you present the info!
322 right now
140% of the float short position is insane. It’s an unlimited loss position and these funds got caught being way too greedy. I’m sure JPow will bail them out.
Very well explained, thanks
Outstanding video, the way you explain the concepts with the charts and drawings make it SO much easier to understand, thank you. A shining lighthouse in a storm of information!
Fantastic video mate, very clear to the point
Very well explained, thanks!
U explain in your course ,how to trade and find short squeeze stocks !??💸💸

I really appreciated the breakdown in this video. I’ve liked and subscribed 👍
After going through a bunch of vids this is the first video that actually made me understand what the heck is going on for the most part...  my curiosity is now sated...  thanx.
Buy and hold GME.  Bend over and take it wall street fat cats 🐱
After you consider the possibilities of making drastic losses while trading on your own. There is a huge undeniable effect of experience and proficiency in the market.  Therefore, before you enter any market you have to be acquainted on: 1. Time conservation  2. Productive trading strategies  3. Swift money management plans Without proper knowledge on the basic requirements for being in the money, you can as well equate all your efforts to zero. The trader I work with has studied the system all round so you are sure to make improvements when you enroll with him. Mr Barry Sanders handles most of my trading and I withdraw my profits myself after each trading period, honestly and client based relationship is highly valued by Barry Sanders. Don’t give up now in trades, Mr Barry Sanders will help you recover more.
looks like someone just cashed out 75% of gamestop stock
BNGO!
what is the name of the drawing app used on all screens ?
Great video bro
Love how the SEC is trying to change the rules now. God forbid we make an institution a bag holder for a change.
Great stuff Umar!!
The knotty error systemically afford because japan interestedly wreck beyond a accurate hubcap. smelly, glamorous lemonade
Your source for % shorted shares is outdated by a month tho??
Great video and information... The only reason I can't fully understand this is because I don't know why anyone would be a short seller? The risk well out weighs the rewards because the loss can be unlimited but the gain limited.  IDK? I don't see the advantage of short selling vs regular buying?
Is it a good idea to buy puts now ? I mean it will crash down again for sure lol
Thank you Umar!!
Thanks a lot Umar!
Great vid!
Life savings in. Sell Limit set at $420.69. Going to red lobster to celebrate when it does.

I have watched a ton of videos on shorting and and thought I had a general understanding, but watching your video it finally clicked and you explained it so clear. Great video and great thanks for the the “short” education lesson.
Very good video! I have a question that may someone could help me answer. Gme got squeezed right. Lets assume wsb tries to repeat their success with let's say amc. They start squeezing amc and it starts going up like it is now. What would happened if the people shorting amc learned their lesson with what happened to gme and cover their shorts and exit amc. Will the squeezed lose alot of buying pressure and only slightly squeezed or what will happen.
hey umar who is buying in gme, initially
BB
Saw that wall street Reddit going bananas and I did wonder what it was all about.
UMAR !! is there a reliable way to prevent my shares to get borrowed by someone who wants to short them ?
So clear, precise and nice speed. Thank you
Thanks, what do you think about BlackBerry (BB)??
I believe GameStop will be a going concern into the next decade.
If you're buying GME, buy without debt and have the expectation to lose. That's the safe play. You can sell it at a higher price or you can keep it as a value play. Your choice.
Depending on stocks is like making no move to success in trading.
AMC next and then I am liking SKT a lot , it has all the criteria for a short squeeze. Low float, half of the shares are shorted and 17 days to cover. In addition, volume has increased 6 folds today and major resistance was broken today.
1000s of people that could maybe by 50 shares at most, just stuck it to a ton of wall street billionaires.
Do you think EXPR is in a squeeze currently? 🔥🚀

I didn't know WTHeck was going on, but now I know!! I'm getting  positions on several short squeeze stocks tomorrow.
Damn Bhai Jaan, this was the best stock related explanatory video I have ever seen. 👏🏼
Looks like AMC is going to explote tomorrow.

Except what’s happened so far isn’t the short squeeze. There is still 139% of stocks shorted. They haven’t started covering yet.

Damn bro thanks for the video appreciate the explanation
Gamma squeeze = Short squeeze
Another amazing squeeze opp is SPWR. Youve mentioned it a ton and I actually went and did some DD, posted it on WSB forums. Its a fire opportunity and has a 50% short float as you know! Thanks for the great vid again man.

I've had about 40+ tabs open this evening, and I've been skipping around trying to understand the GME short squeeze.  YOU gave the best explanation and just saved me hours of research!  Thanks for that!

Great video, Umar !
So informational and great presentation. Keep it up bro loving them
Great video! I am kind of new to stock so I have few questions. So the companies that does these shorts are hedge fund companies in wall street? I kind of don't see the benefit of doing short stocks since one can lose lot of money if the stock goes up. Why are these hedge funds doing it? Also hedge funds borrow money from brokers but where do these brokers work from? Bank?
I know nothing about stocks and this was a pretty good explanation
I think it will go up a little bit more but now it seems like AMC stock will be next so lets see, Thanks!
CTRM
Super explanation! Holding AMC 🚀🚀🌕
WE LIKE THE STOCK

Excellent video, very informative!
👉🏻 ATNF (180 Life Sciences) Under the radar gem is an understatement. Potentially and very likely will soar 25X or more current stock price . Co-Founded by Prof. Raphael Mechoulam "THE GODFATHER Of Cannabis Research" Discovered the Endocannabinoid system and isolating the two primary compounds, CBD and THC. ATNF has a Tiny 1.4 million share float(Most likely much smaller at this point) with an addressable $150 Billion worldwide pipelines to address unmet needs of the number #1 cause of all autoimmune diseases in the world (Inflammation) and Chronic Pain Therapies with the Best Minds in the world. Dream Team All Star Management created drugs and companies that sold for close to $100 BILLION. They are in phase 3 the last phase of a potential $5 Billion therapy for Dupuytren’s Disease which there is no other treatment available. Phase 2 exceeded all primary endpoints. They are fully funded with grants (only the best of the best 1% ers receives grants) and cash on hand for 3 years as per CEO 3 weeks ago on latest presentation. Market cap is tiny around $56 million. Patent portfolio alone is worth 8X the current stock price. Management owns 50% of the outstanding shares and 60% of outstanding shares cannot be sold for 12 Months.  Management is taking compensation in form of stock NOT cash.
This movement is strong.  I understand the movement.  This is like qanon but you make money instead of following a turd down the toilet with your mouth open.  Qanon was blindly against "liberals" , this movement is mostly blindly against the insidious shorting industry, but the big difference is were all making money while qanon was left looking like dumdums.  If 75m people can believe some whacked out stuff like qanon which left a lot of them broke from buying useless trump flags, this short squeeze movement has the potential to be much stronger cause WE ARE MAKING MONEY AND CAN CASH OUT AT ANY TIME.
I’m completely new to stocks, like 3 weeks in new. Thanks for helping me understand whats happening. 100% will continue to watch your content
Wishing everyone on here good health, great success, and everlasting happiness!
I subscribed to your channel, just because of how u explained this. First time on you channel, great and easy explanation
Its like climbing a ladder that keeps getting taller the faster you climb
so what is the point in playing short? seems like a lot of risk little reward
Thank you Umar, this video really helped explaining what options are! I've never been able to grasp such an easy concept, but this helped a lot
I bought 200 AMC stock this afternoon
People saying "1st amendment right" are stupid bro lol the SEC doesnt give a fuck, they will cater to the institutions and make a rule change regardless of people coming together and saying "i like this stock" I dont want this to happen either but it most likely will dude!! I wanted to get in this morning at $80 but didnt because im pussy hands but also because i dont want my money to be fucked up someway because these billionaire cunts think we cant manage money ourselves
Buy a 200 call?? Tomorrow they will shoot again right? Then the 200 call will make me rich??
do you think amc will be one of those $50 in less than a couple weeks like gme?
what you think about amc, Fubo, Macerich and bb? Anything which we may buy for short term?
OM-effing-Gosh 🤯 This video was so great. I've been hearing "float" so much and i told myself I'd be researching that some time this week, then, magically, when i wasn't even trying, ur video came in as a recommendation. Thank u for simplifying this for everyone out here in the world, especially us newer investors. LIKED. SUBSCRIBED. Now, i have to ask... Can u do the same for someone trying to learn about options?
thankyuuuuu
Buy some VXRT its the first oral covid vaccine coming to market, under $10 with human results incoming, shorts at 35%
sick, ty
Be careful new traders. The SEC can step in anytime they want and freeze this stock to investigate everything. I don't think they have a case at all but to preserve the "sanctity" of the institution I would not out it past them.  If that happens shares could be frozen for weeks or months.
Have you seen amc? I got lucky to get in
Is everyone buying calls or just buying the stock?
Basically wallstreet was caught with their pants down.
The magnitude on how high GME can go is insane. With that much short sell interest and not many shares left to borrow at such an expensive rate, not to mention all the market makers who need to cover their calls. Volkswagen short/gamma squeeze took it from 100 to 1000 a share with only 12.8% short interest. So it ended fairly quickly. Now you have GME with over 140% short interest, extremely high borrowing fees, not many shares available to borrow from brokers, and 2.6 million degenerates on WSB( more coming) from all over the world jumping in on this. Just think about it for a second, and the hedge funds haven't closed their positions because it would shoot the price up so high to their own bankruptcy.    The only way for this to stop going up, is if the price is high enough for everyone to want to cash out which will free up shares for the brokers. WSB community know this and are educating everyone how this infinite gamma squeeze works. In other words, people aren't selling. When they see the call option prices come near expiration date, everyone is purposely bidding up the price to make sure everything expires in the money. All the Market Makers who sold Naked Calls have no choice but to bid up the stock and buy it to hedge their position. And what does the WSB community do with the money from the options that expired? THE CYCLE REPEATS
Excellent video Umar. It helped me a lot to understand these insane moves.
Phenomenal explanation. Kudos. Do short sellers have ANY other option but to "buy back" the shares? Couldn't they just cut their losses?
Does anyone know what software he is using to analyze the trades?
You know this guy is a now on triple digit multi millionare
Dope content bro! Thanks for clearly explaining this madness lol
Getting above 100% short float doesn't even require naked shorting. A brokerage can lend a share to a short seller. The short seller transfer the share to a third party, who may be part of a different brokerage. That brokerage now controls the share and is able to lend it to a different short seller. The same share can be shorted twice (or really any number of times) without any brokerage naked shorting.
Everyone is jumping out of GME and going to AMC next,  get in early on AMC!
AMC.
Great video!! Umar is a star and my guru!
So 140% short float means that 40% of shares borrowed are not available to be covered?
AMC! BREAK DOWN THESE WALLS! BUY! BUY! BUY! STRATOSPHERIC!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quARRzz0pnE
Explained everything perfectly. Thank you!
Thank you Umar...this is really helpful... truly appreciate all your content, it is very crisp, to the point... keep doing the great work you have been doing.. my first comment in you tube
$AMC 🚀
Love this Umar! Super informative. Love your videos as well. Hopefully someday I become a hell of a trader like you!
Bro, this has to be the best point-for-point explanation ON THE INTERNET! Props!!!
He cool  PSEC  Pays monthly 💵 PSEC  Growing in value  PSEC is 👽 with 💵 also with 🚀 keys.  Jesus Christ is God  Also stock is under 7 for now pays 0.06 per share lmk
What’s the website you’re looking at?
Thanks Umar
This will drop! Get ready to short
You don't need brokers to get short positions over 100%. If I lend you a share to short, you're going to sell it the same day. I go buy it back from the market, and then lend it to someone else to short. Lather, rinse, repeat to infinity short position.
Amc
Thank you so much Umar. You are the best.
Max loss is 100$
short game stop. you win like crazy
Very informative. Your a blessing in market world. Thanks umar.Godbless always.
AMC is next
Tbh tho a lot of these kids have no management
Will you take a trade ?
*This is what's going on* -Nobody really thinks GME is really worth $300. It's probably worth $20-$40. But it may very well get to $1,000+ because of forced buying, by market makers and short sellers, who are trying to hedge & cover their short positions. Friday before market close will be crazy. All market fundamentals have been thrown out the window. This isn't like any other situation that has ever happened in history. Because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, these shorts have to cover at prices that seem irrational, but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares. Sometimes stocks which appear to be the “best short ideas” can also be the ones which often end up being most likely to see the most violent short squeezes.
Is a short different from puts? How so?
Anyone here know when it will be a good idea to take on a long term short position ?
Mucha gracias, muy buen video
Good lesson 👌
The market makers who are selling call options are also driving up the stock price by hedging out their deltas on their short call options by buying the underlying proportional to their deltas. It’s like a double squeeze as the price continues to  increase!!!
Umar, thank you for the detailed information we all appreciate it.
This is insane.  If people don't sell and keep holding.  It could potentially hit 500 a share or very close  Wednesday.
TOS wont let me short it right now. 2 hours ago short sale was available but I was not ready to jump in. What broker is best for shorting?
SOMEBODY FINALLY ADDRESSES THE BIG PICTURE, Not just what a short is... BRAVO
IDEX is the squeeze to see !
So I should be ready to catch GameStop on the way down?
So, what happens if nobody sells out of their position and the institutions who shorted are forced to cover on Friday? Do we see this explode to ~$500?
Great video, 1 question. why was game stock on a downwards trend or trading sidewards over the last few years? if this squeeze has been possible all this time why is it only now it has happened. how are short sellers manipulating the market to keep the price on a downwards trend?  from my understanding there has not been enough shares in circulation (from non short positions) so trying to pump the stock was not possible unless something like WSB bought every share available? correct me if I'm wrong thank you
the $200 Calls opened today. Tomorrow we'll see $300 Calls
Solid explanation, thanks
Thank you 🙏 for explaining it so well
Point #5, the blame is in the institutions for creating this tornado
Thanks for the explanation! AMC definitely on watch tomorrow
Bed bath and beyond $BBBY thoughts?? Its got a short float of 66% will this go gamma short squeeze?
What do u think about SPCE ?? It’s short float is 31%
Not sure the explanation of how you get to 140% short is quite accurate. When you borrow the shares and sell them, the new owner can then lend them out for shorting, so you end up with more shares than the float available for shorting without anything illegal and without naked shorts. But the squeeze is certainly interesting and fascinating, especially when the shorts reloaded to try and take it down again.
Amazing video!!
AMC IS NEXT
My dawwwwwggg, thanks for the vid. Killed it
Great explanation Umar.  Appreaciate it.
👍
Well explained. 👍🏻
Also don't forget about $AMC its flying...
Where do you see GME going to next???
🔥
I like your cut g
Looks like it's going to 1k at least but we'll see. This could easily make the VW squeeze look like nothing. I'll be keeping up with what CNBC says and doing exactly the opposite.
Amc to $35
My respect for umar went up 📈 for making the video while getting hair cut
Thank you for everything you do umar. learned a lot from you bhai.
