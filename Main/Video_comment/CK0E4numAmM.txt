7:22 Chan: How about we have another member? 😁
Aahhhhh maniac ❤❤❤
What a group, to be so appreciative of their fans to watch their creations and react to them ♥
i love all of them so much but the way they only give simple reaction to the only boy cover there, i feels like not kinda fair. in fact he's the bestest among the best. 😅😅
We need a part 2🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
J’adore ça qu’il y aie réellement un échange entre les fans et les artistes
I think is STRAY KIDS Really reaction biggest surprise for everyone getting shocked their's songs Korean boy band are Bang Chan changbin Han Felix Lee know seungmin and I.N eight members stay fans STRAY KIDS anywhere around the world showing concerts Soon ❤❤❤❤ 12:17 countries
The “ahh” “eeee” 1:17
I need to see jisung with purple hair moree
2 YEARS AGO?
I love that even though Stray Kids has become such a big hit and they’re really popular, they are still humble. There was no arrogance, or anything. They were genuinely happy to see people covering their songs and for some of them they were immediate like “yeah that’s better “ this is why I Stan them guys ❤❤❤
4:57 ايان ردود فعله المسكين راح يعتزل من جد الكيبوب 😂😂
l Love you straykids❤❤❤
O SONHO DE TODO STAY SENDO NOTADO/A PELO STRAY KIDS!!!😭❤️‍🩹 Essas moças cantaram muito bem :3 Algum Stay brasileiro??🇧🇷🇧🇷
me over here clapping after each one
I Love You Guys😊❤
Before i liked your music and i was a big fan of you STRAYKIDS❤
9:07 I don’t think Han and Hyunjin liked it 😅….. also all these are good singers. Their voices are all drowned out and it just sounds like they’re not putting their full voice into it.
OMG 😳 WOW THAT'S AMAZING😮
Is cut
❤
Wooow!! These covers are really great!! They change the vibe of the songs, but you can tell the people who created them are talented <3 And btw, the expressions on Han, Changbin, and Minho's faces cracked me up xD
unexpected because this girl was Indonesian😭 5:26
RED LIGHTS KILLED ME-
Lee Know face: 🤨🤨😯
Felix during  the song red lights crazy
Hyunjin bit his hand at the beginning of the first red lights 😂
ugh these reactions are SO genuine. especially since you know 3racha also produced their songs. it's incredible how they are watching, completely silent to take it all in, and then they give their praise. I love watching this so much!!!
Why does Hyunjin look so Disgusted on Circus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love you guys
Han looks like he is secretly judging 😂❤
1:27
what 1+4+3
2:45 Han’s face is like “did this girl just tell me to shh??”
Bang Chans dad sounds😂😂😂❤❤
I WISH THERE IS PART 2
That first red lights cover was amazing. You know it’s good when Chris makes the stank face.
Any BTS here🫶🏻🫶🏻💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🫰🏻🫰🏻

Why i just felt like they are more beautiful in natural way without makeup.....🚨(I'm referring to the people who covered not stray kids)

Why is no one talking bout the circus cover!!?? It was so good!!!
I love the two girls they were so good especially the harmony
Everyone killed it but Pimwa's acoustic cover was hauntingly beautiful. I really hope she goes far. Her voice is insane!
The 2 Girls was for me the best
why did they put the bad ones.
not me fanning over stays
i.n why are you in love with Mae because you said she is so beautiful 🤩

❤🎉👏🏻😎🤩🫶🏻
Guys listen   The person who tried to make felix ( straykids) blind is now attempting to make lee know(straykids) blind, using laser pen. Blind with sharp dartson August 24th-25th. Apparently they will also harm hyunjin (straykids). Please spread this message on all platforms, if possible, so JYP can see this. Requesting all stays and all other fandoms to spread this information by copy and pasting, making videos or some sort of way to spread this information (i saw somebody comment in other channel )
They should react again but with their new track DominATE  Escape would be so good and Cinima (i think i spelt it wrong lol)
Hyunjin looks so much in disbelief after listening to pimwa’s cover of Red lights. Truly a beautiful rendition! ❤️🥹
Honestly if I was covering a song id do railway since it's only English lyrics and I can't speak Korean🙂
7:48 this guy kinda looks like mark lee.
The hijab girl reminds me of me 😂❤
The girl who sing Red light she is so good

The thing is, SKZ are artists that KNOW music, they dont just sing as singers, they have technical knowledge and skills as well as talent so their comments on these covers are more elaborate than just "it sounds good" and that has got be amazing for those fans to hear.
Stays are such a talented fandom so proud to be part of it ❤
Честная и теплая реакция SKZ говорит об их искренности и эмоциональности.❤❤❤
4:16 oh

The last girl was so overwhelmed seeing them to react to her cover and i felt that 😌
OMG STRAYKIDSSSSSSSS❤❤❤❤❤❤
10:23 if red lights was a ost for a dramatic drama:
Leeknow in his head "if u dont have anything nice to say don't say anything" "the last one was the best"
Honestly this is the best kpop covers reaction I’ve seen. They’re genuinely amazed by these covers 😂 also loving their commentaries ❤
My God why are they so beautiful? ❤
u know its good when bangchan looks like he smelled diahrea
Han, changbin and hyunjin regretting they life decission...
Felix is so beautiful
Last girl was trying so hard not to cry in the first clip of her reaction, and that’s what finally broke me and made me cry.
THE FACES OF HYUNJIN AND HAN LOLL
2:42  The way Felix want to feel the song....  Uff ,, Just stole my heart 💙💙
THE GIRLS WHO COVERED RED LIGHTS SLAYED.
I feel like Bangchan was cringing while watching the Red Lights cover(the first one). Am I the only one who feel like that?
The girl at 2:14 ate. I think it was the cover boys really wanted to add to their playlists. Look at Hyunjin 😄
Bruh when the girl was singing circus han's face looked like he didn't understand a word or he was just shook
8:54 hyunjins face 😂
The first red lights cover was actually better than the original-  No hate to skz!❤❤❤
Not me thinking when IN said it’s pretty on the first song I though it said she’s pretty and I was thinking she is so lucky
قسم بالله يسلكوونن خاصة هان 😭😭🗿
the two with red lights was so awesome
Cause no one wrote this anyone here in 2024?!
Bang Chan looks like he found his soul mates of RedLights 😂

I’m sure glamour could have done a better job with finding better covers for their songs because I’ve seen wayyy better covers myself. Red lights was bang on.

Привидите Айку или Кадзу.
Felix needs his glasses
8:37 hyunjin looks so unsure whether or not he likes it😭 i’ve seen a few of her covers and i personally do think she’s good but i hate how she makes it sound like it echoing bad quality microphone😭
This is so wholesome
HANS REACTION IN THE BEGINNING 😭😭😭

I wish I could cover songs....I'm a terrible singer because I'm tone deaf.
2:40 CHAN LOOKED SO DISGUSTED  😭😭😭
Felix ain’t ok
I love how for every red lights cover, chan would just cringe the whole time at his own song 😂not the people singing but because he's getting shy cuz of the lyrics lmao 🤣
I LOVE PIMWA'S COVERS AND TO SEE SKZ REACTION TO HER- I PICKED THE RIGHT PERSON TO LOVE😭❤
They look like BTS!! It upsets me so much!!!

K-pop star Felix of Stray Kids recently donned a Louis Vuitton trucker jacket in its Bubble Damier pattern for a performance in Fukuoka, Japan, foreshadowing tighter ties with the French luxury brand. He just signed on as a house ambassador, and no one could be more excited than Nicolas Ghesquière, artistic director of women’s collection ...
I think the second and last ones were my favorites! Butt they were all so good wow. I need to listen to the whole covers!
Szczęśliwi🥰
I was cringing so hard and i dont know why😭😭😭
Proud Bang Chan

If there was a way for these talented fans to collaborate with SK, as back vocals on a song or something,it would be amazing because they are so unbelievably talented. Second lady singing red lights omg 😮

Omg I saw this same segment for BTS and so happy to see it done for Stray Kids!!! It’s so true that Stray Kids songs seem really hard to cover. Everyone did an amazing job!! My favorites were definitely the red lights covers though. So much talent!! And Stray Kids are so humble and appreciative.
I think my favorite was the Maniac cover for sure!
They were dying tbh
EVEYONE DID SUCH AN AMAZING JOB AND IM SO HAPPY FOR EVERYONE WHO WAS IN THIS VIDEO!! YOU ALL DID FANTASTIC❤❤❤

외국인 팬들이 너무 잘 따라하시네요. 👍
Gaston и Lex, Jade особенно приятно удивили... Молодцы❤ так рада за всех, кого послушали ребята!! На самом деле очень надеюсь, что после второго кавера на Red Lights 3RACHA вдохновятся на струнное сопровождение хоть в каком-нибудь виде хдд было бы здорово...
I’m sorry but the third one was bad, I just feel like they could have done better then what they did. Just saying
2:13 I LOVE THEMM SO MUCH OH MY GOSHHH

This was so much fun to watch! Everyone did so well. Giving a shout-out to Pimwa for her beautiful voice and unique version of Red Lights, one of my all-time favorite SKZ songs.  💐💐💐
The rest of the group was saying how good Gastons was and seungmin just said the magical words 🌟BiNg BiNg🌟
Is this real Or not
Hyunjin was at a loss for words with that acoustic red lights cover
the last one’s speech is so touching 😢❤ its true, straykids are the reason I continue to try things even theres not much paybacks. I LOVE ALL THE COVERS <3 love straykids, love stays, straykids everywhere all around the world 💕
ALL OF THEM WAS PERFECT, BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT 2 GURLS VOICES!!!!

Red light cover🖤
That was so cool!! It was a really fun idea to allow this kind of interaction between SKZ and the fans, as well as giving space for talented STAY to show themselves to the world, I hope that whatever their goals in the music world are, this moment will help them to achieve it!!!! Plus Pimwa definitely got a new fan and I got a crush hahaha
I have been waiting so long for stray kids to react to fan covers and it finally happened🙏🥺
Franchement je le dit souvent mais stray kids vous m’avez tellement aider et je vous adore de tout mon coeur je dit pas souvent que vous êtes mon groupe préféré mais vous l’êtes vous êtes le première groupe que j’ai écouter et merci d’être là franchement continuer vous êtes incroyable

oh so if i sing a stray kids song on youtube then i’ll get noticed by them 😭
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂2:52 Chan’s face 😂he got that stank face when somethings good😂
Es increíble que siendo tan grandes artistas sean tan humildes, no es común ver que ídolos se comporten como ustedes mil gracias, gracias.❤❤ por eso
So cool seeing them react to stays covers of their songs. Thanks for having them on Glamour!
i love how Lee Minho was getting blown by the covers
The last two girls were the best,I really wish they would make Stray Kids react to dance covers too!
Imagine being one of these stays I would scream omg
2:41 and when you see Bangchan doin that face you know it's a bop 2:50 jokes, all of them are in love
no cause the red lights covers ARE INSANE
the cringe i saw in their eyes is ultimate 💀💀
BRO WHAT TF WITH CIRCUS COVER I CANT, HYUNJIN'S FACIAL EXPRESSIONS SAY EVERYTHING
Yaaasss been waiting for this!!! 😆😆

Me gustó mucho el hecho de que hayan visto uno en español me encantó❤❤❤❤😊😊, creo que voy a considerar hacer covers tal vez tengo la suerte en el futuro de que lo vean 😅😅😅
3:49 the girl who gave credit to her guitarist

Red Lights by Pimwa - what a voice!!!

I watched same video with BTS watching people covering their own music and they weren’t as enthusiastic and excited, as stray kids don’t know why!
são puro talento e sortudas
ITS OKAY TO LAUGH BABES
Y'all...😮The fact that my most FAVORITE kpop cover artist was getting appreciated by Stray kids, ABSOLUTELY BLOWS MY MIND!!!🤯 And that is? Lexxx!!!!😊👏🏻✨
Gosh this gave me second hand embarrassment💀💀
The subtitles thinking chan said grandma 😭😭
Circus and Thunderous  cover is great. Red lights too, but to me not that much.
Di reaksi changbin ngeri kayak lagi ikut audisi😂
Bang Chan ❤
ada kak sali
THE LAST ONEEEREE
8:47 لو هيونجين عطاني هالنظرة و انا اغني لأرمي تفسي من اعلى طابق من الفشلة 😭😭😭😭

2:57 تشانغبين بالعالم الموازي!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭
I will say stray kids songs are really hard to cover not a lot of people can do it properly and make the music their own hats off to the people who did it and did it very well ❤❤
Imagine they put a bad cover and they just had to act like they loved it☠️
SKZ😭💓
2:52 2:54 CHAN’S FACE LMAO
slay, but they should totally make ateez do this and show them that one deja vu cover.💀
HAHAHA
Ate and left no crumbs! Love straykids!!
What was the point of the capcut effects in the first cover??? That looked so goofy💀💀
so happy to be a stay, they were honestly so talented!!
amamos!<3 gran trabajo de todos, y amé las reacciones d elos kids
perdón pero el cover en español es una poronga
Y como los escogen los chicos los videos a plataforma los envían??
Everyone who covers RED LIGHT is amazing ❤
stays are so talented wtf
Escucharon un cover en español eso significa tour por latam ☝️🤓
I loved this
LMAO FELIX BOPPING HIS HEAD WITH A SERIOUS FACE IS SO FUNNY TO ME
Felix: before we sleep, we can listen to this all the time  That made laugh idk why lmao
I can't stop re-watching Piwma. Her version, the voice and the music are fantastic, it's an addictive cover. But all the luck to all of them.
كيف شافوا فيديوهاتهم حتى انا اغني 😢😢😢
love it!
So many talented Stays <3
that gods menu one plss
Han questioning his place as a singer more and more with each cover XD
Skz are amazing ❤️ all the ppl that did their covers were amazing as well  ....  I want to see seventeen there
So far the cover's for red lights are fire!!
this was so enjoyable to watch, thank you for having them 🥰
I can't do anything except feeling jealous.

Chan face killed me 🤣🤣
We want billie eilish and bts part 2
Man these stays r so lucky I wish I was like them.
2:44 i love how throughout this felix is so intent on realllly hearing them and focusing on it 🥹
BRO I WISH I HAD RECORDED MYSELF SINGING PLS MAKE THEM DO THIS AGAIN
I just love the way they enjoyed the covers💜!! Bangchan 's  expressions tho<3
I hope for part 2  They should see a cover of MANIAC by Jackie-O 💔💔
Am I the only one who thinks they should also do a reaction to people covering straykids dances.  Also mad respect to the people in the video cause like their voices were a blast ❤❤❤❤❤❤
2:50 Chan's face telling everything. Bruh he is satisfied 😏😩
HAAAAH THEIR REACTION SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING 😮😂

You know when Chan makes the disgusting face, it's a bop & Hyunjin omg bro's mesmerized by the red light singers 🛐
LMFAOAOAOA they were cringing so much, i would too these covers were…interesting!
This is why I looooove Stay’s, we are literally amazing 😍👏🏻 like hello?!!!

Феликс и банчан и чонин в шокн
I watched Pimwa's cover of Red Lights literally just before I saw this video of SKZ reacting to fan covers. Such weird timing, lol.   But this was GREAT, and I hope they do it again soon. I'm sure there are quite a few amazing covers of Stray Kids songs out there, yet to be discovered!!  For those who want to watch Pimwa's full cover, look for this video title:  Red Lights (강박) - STRAYKIDS Cover by pimwa | 스트레이 키즈
Am new stay and I have a question, what happen twhen hyunjin in the hand:(

I'm glad finally Chan came to know that stays can sing good too😂😂😂😂😂
The faces they made while watching HAHAHAHA
The way they all got butterflies when listening to the second girl😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
To me,  red lights cover was the best!!  Red light is really one of my favourite song and it has that melody that is So pleasurable to sing and extremely pleasing to ear... The melody of it is Just incredible... All other covers of the songs were great too..thanks to these amazing ladies for these amazing covers....
overhajimaaa saliruuummm
Pimwa is such a beautiful soul, I just love her so much!
Glamour producers really sleeping on our God's Menu cover 😴😴💤
9:03 I follow her on YouTube and she does Stray Kids edits, imagine yourself with Stray Kids... Really talented
WHY IS THIS TRENDING HELP
They were not phased by Gods Menu at all lmao, I’m sorry but that one sucked so much 💀
Aynı kıyafetle kaç tane röportaj yaptınız siz banfjfsmkgfm
Why it's cringing me out?!?
CONGRATS TO YALL, YOURE SO TALENTED😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Bang Chan too much cute for that ❤
It would be better if they made a reaction to the dance cover😪
The people who got Chan doing the disgusted face won it all.
Me gustaría que reaccionen a los cover dance 😊
Everybody did great but the two Red Lights covers are something else 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
Pimwa singing red lights is a whole eargasm
Inspiring artists and fans across the world. This is what Stray Kids brings to the world of music. They love what they do and they encourage others too. They are loved!

Каверы на ред лайтс😳
I'm over getting excited for all the people they reacted to and kicking my feet around on my bed😂 y'all are so talented and I love Stray Kids' reactions as well. Also I loved Seungmin's comments
الفرقة الوحيدة الي تقدر فانها الحمدلله اننا ستاي وانهم موجودين بحياتنا ❤❤🐱 لاحظت ان هيون وهان فيهم شي او متضايقين و يد هيونجين فيها شي يعمري كأنه مجروح او شي
HELP 😭
You know it's good when chan made the "disgust-aproval" face HAHAHA

You know it’s a hit when you see Chan giving the disgusted look 😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Thank you glamour Thank you straykids
Our stays are really talented. Yeah I love skz and stay 💕🔥
😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Hyunjin, when he opened a broadcast, there was a wound in his hand, and now we see that it becomes deeper, are you okay?
ЗАЧЕМ ИМ ЭТО ПОКАЗАЛИ 😭😭
Look how proud they are 🥺🥺
The red lights covers were out of this world, SKZ WAS SHOOKETH
Чан на рэд лайтс это отдельный вид искусства
Whoa mad props to all the STAYS who had the confidence to cover some of the most ICONIC skz songs I literally could not IMAGINE anyone else covering and let alone so beautifully.. You guys put a talentless stan (me) to shame. And thanks again stray kids for never failing to inspire us, empower us with your music and provide us with great content (lol).
Ok but both of the red lights covers  were so good🤭‼️
I feel bad for skz
صغصععصييللنن
발음 진짜 짱좋으시다 다들
As a colombian im glad that spanish or colombians are getting the recognition they deserve😋 my girl did great i could immediately tell she was colombian 😜
And I am stray giiirl
Amo cuando hacen esto❤
Ok I'm so happy for Lex. Girl's been working really hard. She deserves to be noticed ❤.
2:29  jeongin looks disgusted i dont think it was intention tho  😂🤣🤣
OMFG WHO YELLED "WTH"
STRAY KIDS WORLD DOMINATION
This is making me want to make me friends and I cover their songs  All our years of studying music better pay off 😭
i’m soooo sorry but y’all done pick the bad fan covers except for the two red lights one.
Stray kids and stay is complete each other. They compliment each other hardware, talent and artistic value.
eu to me mijando
Bangchan's stank face says it all...
I know they’re disgusted watching the gods menu one😭
THIS SO CRINGE HELP
THE TWO GIRLS THAT COVERED RED LIGHTS ARE SO TALENTED AND SO STUNNING
2:58 what happened with your hand hyunjin 😮
The last cover of red lights is really amazing!
2:51 CHAN FACE— LMAO
WHY CHANGBIN LOOK LIKE THAT WHEN THEY SING HIS  PART🤨🤔😑 IM DYING
For the circus one I love how excited Seungmin looked 🥰🥰
I love the voice of the girl who sings Red Lights in a dreamy version. I am so happy for Lex, I have listened to all her Stray Kids and other Kpop covers on her channel.
the thunderous cover was so☠
Red Lights cover was so good, I was so mesmerized by her voice and the melody so quick and I'm definitely going to be listening to her cover every night
no manches hasta salió Karolaysm
LEX???? SHE MADE IT!!!!
Las 3 chicas que hicieron cover de red lights sabían lo que hacian ¡Que genias!
Lo hicieron bien chicas y chicos ❤️🖤
No se si me gusta mas Stray kids o lxs Stay's 😍 Muchas gracias a este canal que hizo posible y se le ocurrio hacer este tipo de video 💖
Que bueno que hicieron esta reacción... para que vean que son amados en diferentes partes del mundo no importa el idioma su música llega a varios paises .... i love you stray kids
I'm sorry I can't watch this
💞💞
bangchan was trying so hard not to laugh
It's wild to me that people don't know who Lydia Paek is but I guess it's a generational thing. They did a great job and also loved Pimwa's voice, i'm gonna check her out :)
<33
What did Chan say here? 0:58
I was probably more nervous than the Stay’s in this video hahaha SO COOL!!!! I haven’t had the time to venture out to the covers for Stray Kids so this was a great intro to that side of it! Great job everyone!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
LEX OMG BLUEPRINT OF STAYVILLE
Maniac and red lights 2 were so good 🤩
Que le paso a hyujin en  la mano y me alegra mucho de que allan reaccionado a stay dios los amo mucho me preocupa hyujin 😅❤
10:30 their faces (especially Lee Know).  That was amazing!
Girl im a fan of pimwa. Im following her rn
I have no idea who stray kids are but I love them
Some of these covers…😬👀 no tea no shade but I’ve heard and seen better
both red lights covers were absolutely amazing
Stray kids los amo y que bueno ver que todas las personas que dedican a hacer covers sean tomados en cuenta por su arduo trabajo y dedicación en cada covers que hacen felicidades a todos.
BYEE ALL OF THEM WERE BAD EXCEPT THE RED LIGHTS ONE 😭😭
There a young lady that covered Taste she was extremely talented and amazing. Maybe they will get to see and hear her as well. Stray Kids are simply the best 😍. This is my absolute favorite group. Seriously they were so humble and kindhearted as usual. I absolutely love all of them and I hope they continue to have many more successful years to come they absolutely deserve it ❤
2:53 Channie's face ☠️
I’m a stay but stays are so cringy😭😭😭
i love how all this ppl keep saying keep doing music you guys aspiring them  ❤❤
Woww you're all amazing!
Pimwa and the those two girls covering red lights goosebumps..
i loved this idea of them reacting fan covers.
Hyunjin me representa
A
When I saw lex I was so happy 😊
cuando Bangchan dijo "I'm gonna guess that's Spanish" that hurts a little bit  :' (
This so embarrassing to watch 💀💀
*they're so humble*
A CARA DE DESGOSTO DELES
I love them sm their so funny 🤣

The orchestral version of red lights with the harmonies and gorgeous voices gave me chills!! That cover was incredible kudos to those girls 🫶🏼

Oh, everyone is so talented! I dream one day to make a cover, or a million, but I can never pick one song to focus on because they have so many amazing ones :)

second hand embarrassment
i just know banchan’s toes were curling when he heard the red lights cover🤭.
LEEXXXXX BAAABBEEEEE YOU'RE FAMOUS NOW
I knew Lex would appear lol ❤️
This is all around sooo wholesome! I was having a "I hate people day" but this reminded me that there is also good. Thank you! 🥰
Me encanto que reaccionaran a un cover en español ❤🥺😭
They need to do a video of reacting to edits
Looos amo son tan grandiosos 😭😭😭❤️

Both red lights one are my fav  Stays are so talented
Todos los covers están cagados y la verdad admiro a Stray kids por no reírse y no burlarse, yo lo ubiera hecho
2:22
Fofos demais 🥹🫶💓
2:49
I bet these jealous idiots who leave rude comments are the ones who can't sing. 💀 These Stays got noticed by Stray Kids for their talents and here you are behind the screen being miserable.
at 10:43 i just was like they ateeee
Y’all should do this, but with tiktoks or dance covers
OMG THAT'S A HUGE THING CONGRATS TO ALL THE OWNERS OF THE COVERS
De tantos cover's en español buenos que existen ..... Eligieron ese-
My energy when i see skz>>>>
Now chan is gonna start listening to our covers💀
I would like to be one of those fans I know all their songs
ver que los chicos opinen sobre el talento de stay me llena mucho el corazón.. son tan lindos y que simplemente hayan incluido el español me da tanta ilusión  de poder verlos en Latinoamérica, los amo demasiado STRAY KIDS EVERYWHERE ALL ARAOUND THE WORLD, YOU MAKE STRAY KIDS STAY<3
2:45 Felix’s ASMR ears listening carefully 😂
What is her YouTube page
How can they make the do that..😭😭😭
imo the only good covers were both red lights covers and the circus one
Dude l'm in love with han's haircolor&#-@&#&.   And absolutely all of them
What surprises me the most is the humility that these boys of mine continue to have. I love and admire them very much. we will always be here!
Надеялась увидеть здесь один из каверов Jackie-O...
🤭
I love you so much Stray kids💗💗💗
bro stays are so pretty
The first two singers? Could literally open for Stray Kids. Maybe sing their songs so SKZ can take a little intermission for themselves? LOL. SO good.  And the last two girls that covered Red Lights were INCREDIBLE.
sorry this is random meme but still  felix: cooking like a chef im a 5 star michelin :D  also felix: how do i make pancakes
The red lights covers are so good.. i love the different arrangements
omg! me encantooooo, estas personitas son tan talentosas! estoy muy feliz que a stray kids les haya gustado ^^
LA CHICA QUE CANTÓ EN ESPAÑOL?????, GANÓ EN LA VIDA AKSKKS
Physically I can NOT watch this bro
GASTON PONGGG!!🎉🎉🎉
The two videos that covered Red Lights and the one that covered Circus 🙌🏻 the best!!! I'm quite above average on my musicality so I can can tell on their comments especially the composers/producers of the group every after watching if they really like what they hear. won't go into details but that's it, anyways, good job to all!!! 🫶🏻
Ben söylesem izlemezsiniz amaaa
TY skzzzz ILYYYYY SLAYYYYY<3💗🚨
Now I need Stray Kids reacting to fan dance coveeeeers
2:26 jeongin looked so judgemental lmao
Stop cus those girls that covered red lights are that up frl n left skz speechless
THE RED LIGHTS’ GIRL CRYING OMG SHE ATE
Chan's stank face is a seal of approval!!!😂😂😂
Is it just me but I wanna make my own SKZ cover now cause these people did it so well and I just wanna try 😂
My favorite covers were honestly both of the red lights ones like- WHAT WOOOW OMG THEY WERE AMAZING!!! ❤❤❤
Amazing
Red lights
GASTON I’M PROUD OF YOU

THE SPANISH THUNDEROISNONE IM ABOUT TONCRU
I'm just pleased to see "normal" fan interactions for once tbh. Killin' it talented stays!
Omg they are honestly so lucky for skz to see their videos 😮❤❤❤ I love you Straykids
I NEED THE FIRST RED LIGHT COVER
So proud of all these stays featured in the video so talented
Congrats to PIMWA, my daughter's idol.
Omgggggg LEX, yes SKZ we love her as well, gosh so many talented stays i really love this fandom
Great job on all those covers!  I love that SKZ got to see them and their reactions.
Wait a minute- they didn’t know who lydia paek is?
BRO I GASPED WHEN I SAW THIS TITLE!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AGES
pls tell me someone , why is it so embarrassing to watch?  what's wrong with me?
Their reaction is precious❤ lex makes all the amazing SKZ stuff
Chan making the disgusted face proves that they sang sooooooo good
OMG I KNOW THE GIRL WITH RED HAIRRRR SHE MAKES LOT OF SKZ VIDEOS
gaston！我的天啊！！！真的没想到！！！！！
10:23 Is Lydia Paek, the same girl who sing with G Dragon SBS inkigayo last 2013? i don't remember what song, but if im not mistaken...
I saw people on tt take this reaction thing negativity, they said skz are cringing to it but when i come here to the actual video, i can't see something like that. It's not that bad. Are those people on tt just jealous? 😂
We sare reacting to a girl reacting to skz reacting to her
Oh I didn’t expect to see Pimwa here I’m so happy for her 😭🫶
jeongins face during red lights- 😭
Nice
Changbins reactions are priceless
Каверы на red lights как не от мира сего☄️😩🛐 просто божественно! Последние девочки прям перепели!❤️‍🔥
The 1st gods menu one I wasn’t a huge fan of but yk it’s not like I could have perfect pronounce so yk
Second hand embarrasment was so loud.
Stray Kids es la inspiración de muchas personas que los siguen, muchas gracias Stray kids por darnos esa motivación de seguir con la música, por darnos mucha alegría y sentirnos felices, los amo❤
Sooo are we still the worst fandom 😅 just asking 😂
Феликс я уважаю тебя но пускай  кто угодно но только не хеджин  друг
The two red light covers are amazing
The two girls covering red lights ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Also why does Chan looks like his soul leaving his body when he hears it 😂
I think I fell in love with the 1st cover of red light
I didn't expect that I end up being moved to tears😅😭 I love all covers♥ I love Stray Kids♥
THE GODS MENU ONE ☠️☠️
I was waiting for Lex to appear ❤ she is amazing
Wow stays are amazing 💓
6:03 te amo chan
Everyone praising Straykids for the music they make is just😭💕

To stay who mocks other stay in twitter and tiktok, just so you know, I block all of you 🥰🥰 I don't need any negativity on my timeline
That was such a sweet video , i love the stray kids fandom and stray kids ❤ it was so inspiring and honestly made my day 🥰
Pimwa, the girl who covered red light, seriously gave me the goosebumps. Her voice is amazing, she is crazy talented 😍
The red lights cover by pimwa was 😘😘👌👌
OMG GLAMOUR HAS TO…
9:07 Happy puppy🥹🥹🥹 Obsessed with the Circus and Red lights covers😍😍
Some of these are REALLY good
This is so so precious, everyone said everything I want to say to you ❤️ you guys are such an inspiration to me as well, especially as someone who also struggles with OCD, and I have written three songs of my own inspired by you ("One" - Han, "Flames" - Hyunjin, "He" in "Unspeakable" - Bang Chan). I also have a cover of Levanter coming soon!! Again I love you guys so much and keep being amazing! 🥰
GASTON PONG SLAYYYYYYYY
By janmae, this is it❤🎉
Han´s reaction to the second person was my reaction, like, uau
Redlight covers were so good. I had to go the original videos.😊
I will never forget the moment I saw them on my screen reacting to one of my videos. Thank you so much as a STAY, you make my dreams come true. I couldn't even sleep that day and just watched the video all night long. I still can't believe it, and thank you so much, thank you Stray Kids, for your music, who saved me and gave me strength. Thank you for being born. I love you all so much. ❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣
I AM SO HAPPY FOR LEX CUZ I ALWAYS WAITING HER COVERS
What a cool format, it's very cool, thanks to GLAMOUR for making this happen. STRAY KIDS are incredibly talented and vibrant artists, and their songs inspire so many people around the world to create such great content.
Must be in Hindi too
I really love it when my fellow Stays get recognized! Like, you go besties!!!! <3 I also really love how genuine stray kids are and that is one of the things that I am proud to say that I am a STAY! <3
Lee Know cidden hepsinden etkilenmiş gibiydi. 😅
4:39  this funny
Woah............................ That was beautiful.
SOMEONE SAVE THEM 😭
the red light cover was amazing omg
All stays and skz really said "😮"
they all reacted strongly to Pimwa's cover (for real though babe, you nailed it👏🙌), but Felix cupping his ears and closing his eyes at 2:44 is too wholesome to bear
Голубки
I also wanna be a great singer🤧😭😭😭😭
Wehheeeyyyyy ka salirumm

I am so happy to see lex here ...she slayed every cover song so I was so happy to see stray kids appreciate her❤
ok Glamour.  You win. You bring the boys, you get my sub.
If Chan looks disgusted while listening to your songs. You've made it in life .
I adore everyone and admire everyone who did a cover,  but I was so happy to see Lex there because I've been watching her for a while and it's so nice to see her recognised! STAYs are amazing and so are Stray Kids 💖
meanwhile im here simping over seungmin's english 😭
LAMAOOAOAOA
Orgullosa del latinoamérica nunca pensé que reaccionarian una de mis coveristas favoritas ahhhh estoy llorandooo
You know its good when bang chan makes this face😂😂😂 02:48
I’m getting 2nd hand embarrassment.
I've always loved Lex's cover and they saw it! Im happy for lex!! ❤❤
2:25
Me encantó. Cuánto talento. Muy bien la chica que cantó en español por hacer su versión. Excelente que Straykids los valorice ❤
I know that guy that coverd maniac(Gaston)
EVERYONE WHO COVER THEIR SONGS YALL ARE SO TALENTED
11:1 why does changbin looks armless 💀
That was so cool.
2:52 just know that if bangchan makes this face then he likes it (your voice) 😭
I'm so happy for Lex, i love her covers, she's such a good singer, i hope she can get more popularity😭
ISTG THE RED LIGHT COVER HAS ME ON CHOKEHOLD
The way i just kept saying "i am so sorry" to the kids EVERY SECOND
I'll watch red light covers after this video.. Straykids LIT, Stay also is LIT.
Pimwa’s performance of red lights and Karolay’s thunderous video were phenomenal! They should pursue music professionally! And GASTON I hope he gets a contract!  Love it! The circus cover was refreshing. And the two girls at the end doing Red lights were 😮🫶🏼
I remember the guy who translated S-Class on English and he has incredible vocals. I was hoping that his cover will be included 😢
Wow wow the red light one ❤️❤️
All the covers were amazing and unique in their own way but those Red Lights covers gagged em a little bit. Their reactions were so cute!
Wow what a great kind of video! Thank you🫶
Wow all these covers were amazing, I’m so proud of SKZ and STAY ❤⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Whats your biggest accomplishment in life?   "Skz listened to my cover"
İM SO PROUD OF LEX SHE WAS A HUGE FAN OF STRAY KİDS AND SHE JUST SLAYED
Untung yg di react bukn god's menu yg anjay gurinjay 😭😭
It was so cool to see SKZ hear all those covers and be impressed by them ❤
Словила немного кринжа, а так очень мило, такая хорошая реакция у kids❤❤❤❤
I love our talented fandom<3
Lex really achieved her dream of getting recognized by THE Stray Kids .. CONGRATSS! the covers was burning hot!
Im so happy Gaston is here. His covers are amazingggg.
Skz: trying to speak English Baby bread: I CAN SPEAK KOREAN
OMG @Miraculex YOU'RE IN THIS
I loved this so much! People inspiring people inspiring people and creating a whole positive feedback loop, it's amazing to see 😭💕
My husband,my baby, what happened to your hand???
The red light cover was so good
The way Hyunjin fell in love was so CUTE

スティもすごいStray Kids!
Düşünsenize bir gün bir video çekiyorsunuz ve şarkısına çektiğiniz kişiler buna bayılıyor
Soooooo good❤❤
Indo stay keren bgt😭😭😭😭
This is such a nice plan, since they of course actually write and produce all their own songs... you could really see how happy they were. Props to all the amazing cover artists too!!
Wow🥺🥺🥺~
What is the matter with hyunjin's hand is it hurt 5:11 😢
💕💕💕💕💕💫
Lex...OMG! I've been watching here for years 😭💖💖💖💖 I'm sooo happy for her 😭💖💖
I think they are just trying to be nice and not hate on them😭😭
You know the stuff is good when Chris has that look on his face 😂 (the girl who covered red lights gave me CHILLS)
Что за красивые девушки с мужскими голосами?😂😂😂
AAAAH I LOVE THIS VIDEOOO
WE LOVE TO SEE SKZ & STAY WINNING !!! ❤️‍🩹💖❤️‍🔥
straykids and stays are connected by music is so lovely
i kid you not, the other day i was wondering when channie would do a channies room based on just listening to stays covers! and literally not even that long since i thought about it, this comes up!  i have a gift like that... when i was little i told a friend of my mums "i think you will get married in the future" that actually happened and she got married like 10 years later. i have heard things like this also happen with my nan having dreams of people going to die so she visited them before.. not sure if i just heard this or if its real.. its kinda like a rumor that mum mum told me... so i could be a medium or phychics lol  ive been to my aunties house and literally saw a ghost so i mean.... anything .is.  possible.
They should have shown dance covers
This was absolutely awesome all around. Great covers and I love how they guys gave such great feedback ❤
When Chan gets stank face, that's when you know it's good. XD
At 2.55 Hyunjin has a bandage on his hand, does anyone know why?
SKZ looks so proud and happy to watch those amazing fan covers chan’s expressions reflects their happiness incredibly😍😍❤️❤️
the red lights ones are amazing!!
sana all HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA anw gagaling ng mga kumanta 🥹🥹🥹🥹
I love skz. Idk why they have haters.
The girl that covered 'Thunderous' in Spanish is so good and so cool
DEFINITIVAMENTE LA QUE SE LUCIÓ COMPLETAMENTE FUE LA DE RED LIGHTS, ELLA SI LO HIZO GRANDIOSO ❤❤
you know you've made it when chan gives you the disgusted face
The way if I was a idol I would say if it was bad
when the girl was singing red lights, i knew that Hyunjin would consider her better than them and he did.😂
We all are proud of them and vice versa.
Hyunjins face is everything lmao
IM CRYIG WHY THEY ALL LOOK DISGUSTED LMFAO
Stray kids is inspiring to so many people. Their music is something connect with  people .They give motivation, inspiration  to express yourself it's ok to be unique your are beautiful the way you are. stray kids discography is very diverse with life philosophy.  I describe stray kids music is "EXPRESSION OF PEOPLE" "EXPRESSION OF EMOTIONS" "EXPRESSION OF YOU AND ME"  Stray kid's know for quality of music,  dedication for music.They have very creative and unique and versatile, diverse discography. Love the  intellectual, cleverness and creativity in songs. They have very organic,fresh and unique music. They didn't limited themself and explore new side of music. They explore different genres and express different emotions. They break many stereotypes in music. The more you listen to them the more you admire them and respect them more, because of music they made is connect with you with beautiful message and inspiration.😀
Yeahh
Both red lights covers were my favorites and they were so good.
My cousin which is 9 says that Felix is her bf
Yoo sungmien looks really handsome here and his smile ❤.And all the covers are really great man .
We're proud of stray kids 💘
OMG I'm so happy stray kids did this!!!!! I love watching these videos and have always wanted a Stray Kids and Ateez one!
I've been waiting for this video for son loooooooong
It was so funny lol
What's funny is  chan looked like he was cringing, but he was also like proud when the first person saying red lights 😭😂
THE GIRL WHO COVERED CIRCUS AND THE TWO LAST ONES WHO COVERED RED LIGHTS WERE INSANELY TALENTED WOAHHH (everyone was amazing tho like omg hellooooo???)
พี่ Pimwa คือที่สุดของที่สุด
Lo ame, les amo
Pimwa's version of red lights tho.  🔥 And Chan's stank face 😂 ,you know it's good when he does that. 👏
I know I can't be the only one who felt the emotions and happiness these fans must've felt whenever they saw the kids reacted to their covers
gaston pong getting recogonized was something i really wanted..... i love the redlights cover soo much...... every cover was sooo good to be honest
what's even the point of having cc when it just says "speaking in korean" while covering the hard subtitles on the video...
Omg congrats to Lex! I love her vids!😊
HOW ARE YALL LIKING THESE COVERS… THE ONLY ONE I LIKED WAS THE RED LIGHTS ONE😭
Stray Kids and STAY are the best❤
Ok anyways all the Stays who they reacted to are so freakin talented for god's sake.... Specially the second one and the last girls who covered red lights. Thks to SKZ for reacting to Stays
If I ever made a cover and Straykids doesn’t give me that stank face (meaning they love it ) my life has ended
Red lights covers are my fave :)
U know the covers good when Chan makes that face lmaooo
8:45 Girl I'm so proud of you 😭😭😭
Зачем эти полубабы в русских трендах?
I love how Chan looks like a proud dad watching STAY's covers
CHAN HAVING A DISGUSTED FACE MEANT..It was good..REALLY GOOOD
Thank you so muchh glamour for making this for stays😭🤟
Thanks for inspiring us Stray Kids 🥺❤
What luck, the luck we'll never have
i think this is the main reference(if thats the term) to know/to achieve when you're planning to join the jypaudition
La manita de Hyunjin sigue heridaaa‽😢
Ellos merecen muchos más covers de los buenos como estos , SKZ son dignos los amoooo
Wish they reacted to a cat singing one of their songs. I know there was one on tiktok where a cat sang maniac, it'd be cool to see their reactions.🤣
they should have put rushers maniac cover in, i’m sure they will be amazed
BUSET BUSET BUSET KA SALIII
10:25  I was literally hopping they’ll add this cover in because when I came across it i rewatched it so many times and it lingered in my brain for weeks because of the vocals and harmony
I AM LOVING THIS OMG THANK YOU FOR THIS
Waaah im 😢😭. All of you job well done.
BChan words and facial expression gives me the idea that he feels very deeply certain things such as ppl covering them or complementing their music, he is such a sweetheart ❤❤❤
I LOVE SKZ MARERYB ME HAN
Does anyone have the links to the covers?
I'm so doing a cover of super bowl
STOP I WAS LITERALLY HOPING THEY’D DO THIS
Oh my god my gurl lex!😭😭😭😭
this is so beautiful
You knowyou did good if chan make a weird disgusted face 😭
Would really like to see more of stray kids reacting to the boys singing as well(not saying they are bad, in fact they are probably better), since the male covers have a large contrast to the womens and I would love to see it
I don't think you understand, if they saw a cover of mine and liked it I would go into fight or flight mode fr
Red Light had such a nice cover and it was sang by girls!! Good job!!👏👏❤️❤️
That’s amazing! It melts my heart when I see how Stray Kids react to stays, it’s so touching
My withdrawal says this is Channie’s Room with all the members as special guests
Thank you Glamour, skz and Stay all around the world ❤️
:) ❤
WOW
On the last one when Chan made his iconic disgusted face must have made the cover artist feel happy cause it’s so true that the group loved it
I.N's face during Red Lights- I'm sorry, please forgive me-
Chan making his disgusted face throughout the video let's you know yall did a good job 💀 GOOD JOB STAYS, LOTS OF LOVE

something about lee know speaking up, or even just subtly smiling at certain parts is so very endearing
I cried while watching - they are all so cute! And the guys and their fans. The best community.
So nice to see
When Channie crumples up his face that means is good😂😂😂
Lex is my fav English cover artist and it brings me joy that she got noticed

Girls are very talented
The second and last one are incredible
None of these songs are easy to sing! Props to the people putting themselves out there! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Dang!! Good on Lex! She's been making so many kpop covers in english version. Kudos for her!! She got to see Stray Kids reacting to her covers!! You go girl!!🥰👍
I didnt watch this part of Glamour for a long time.... even with artists I dont really listen to these are pretty fun. Kinda was surprised to see SKZ here... maybe Ateez next? Btw Seungmin's hairstyle and colour really suit him. Looks great.
they were trying so hard to hold in their laughs
Please don’t let them see piper 😭😭😭
Thankyou for making this segmen guys.., i am so happy... Skz really reach many people with their music..
Todo el vídeo estuve viendo las reacciones de Chan:😡😡. Buen trabajo stay❤

FANS LATINAS DE STRAY REPÓRTENSE 😽
I don’t understand why Glamour didn’t find something real and deserve to be on the list! Stays on the video were good but there were people and covers can be on the spotlight for real!
Bahngchahn was about to leave when he heard redlighrs i know yall saw his face
Juat look at Han 😂 this is how I felt about each song cover
Ohhhh… i loved all the covers but I was so happy to see that Spanish cover too!!! Love stays!! All around the world!!
The second red lights cover was also stunning 😭 the vocals were so good
I'M SO HAPPY SKZ SAW PIMWA'S COVER!!! When I saw her cover, I was absolutely mind blown by her talent. I checked out her music and it's incredible. I'm so happy Stay's talents are recognised. Thank you SKZ and Stays 🥰🥰 You are all so amazing
Beautiful Stays all around everywhere
i may not sing, but i edit 😇❕
The first red lights cover was SO GOOD
❤
Wow! Lydia Paek duet w/ the last girl Jade! 🤩🤩 Lydia is a multitalented dancer, singer, songwriter (mainly for YGE). She helped wrote some 2NE1 songs (Ugly, I Love You), Lee Hi (1,2,3,4 & It’s Over) & Blackpink’s As If It’s Your Last!  And she has been featured on various artists songs last G-Dragon, Dynamic Duo & Crush!   My past fangirling moments colliding w/ my present group! Love yah SKZ! ❤
Skz are so proud of stays❤️🔥

When Bangchan said that Pimwa with Red Lights did better than them, I swear if I were Pimwa I would not be alive with such a compliment!!! I love how we're proud of Stray Kids, but Stray Kids is also proud of us. I haven't seen any other idol&fandom love as cute and big and real as SKZ&STAY love. I know I chose the best group ❤
Why didn't they mention the singers names specially the red lights acoustic one loved her tone voice
I'm so happy for my favorite youtuber @lex 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

Stays are so talented and Stray Kids's reaction are the best, especially Bang Chan he is proud of you guys
Pimwa's Red Lights cover turned them all on. They were transfixed.

Thank you Glamour for this video.  Stray Kings 👑
Wow, even stays are so talented and their honest reactions are really wholesome!
2:53 CHAN MAKING THE STANKIEST FACE WHEN HE LIKES SOMETHING
Anyone noticed that IN is basically forgotten in between them  and he seems really disconnected .. I feel so sad seeing him like this .
You know it’s good when Chan pulls that grumpy face lol
Oh this was unexpected and lovely to see all the covers and the appreciation for the vocalists. 🥰
oh wow those red lights covers were perfection
This was amazing, I’m sooo happy that they get to hear all these amazing people do covers of their songs, it truly is inspiring to see this!❤❤❤

I was thinking of Lex right before her part came😭
I LOVE my kids 💗😞😞😞
Omg NONE of them knew Lydia, wow especially Christopher, that's  lowkey shocking!!!
love how felix got really invested at 0:47
Я полностью согласна с певицей, которая выступала последней, так как она сказала то, что чувствовала я: это искренность, честность, доброжелательность, умение ценить своих зрителей и поклонников, умение вдохновлять и дарить надежду! За это я тоже люблю эту группу и этих ребят!❤❤❤
LOVE YOU GUYS!!
.
Red lights cover on both versions SLAPS SO HARD GIVE ME THE FULL VIDEOS
Its okay im not jealous🥺
If Jeongin said "neomu yeoppoda" I think I would die
Our talented stay!!
This was such a cool video. I loved seeing their professional side kick in as they studied different parts of the covers, and the covers were so interesting and well picked.
If Chan does a disgusted face when watching/hearing you sing… babe you won in life
LETS GO LEX NATION !!!!
Omg I am in love with the two red lights covers and skz reactions are so kind like I love them sm I love how they are so honered by the covers and all of the covers are so amazing 🤌🏽WOW
I would have been crying so hard screaming, kicking my feet, and crying tears of sadness AND RED LIGHTS 💡 I WOULD'VE HAVE CRIED SO BAD

Honestly Stray Kids are one of the most difficult groups for making a cover, because their music is so unique and tailored for _them_ , but this was amazing to watch! The last cover of Red Lights made me have full body goosebumps😭stays are out of this world
11:08
Stays estaban teniendo una crisis por los chicos reaccionando, lo hicieron increíble 💖💖💖 Stay are very talented

One of my fears would be SKZ hearing me cover a song simply because I sound like a dying frog while singing. But these people all sounded so amazing!
This is one my favorites video for a media ever
Am I the only one who noticed hyunjin’s  bandaged hand
Omgggg stray kids en latinoamerica🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🫶🫶🫶🫶
Honestly, I started doing covers of kpop songs in Indonesian (on my main channel) because of them. Seeing them really appreciate covers in other languages made me teared up for some reasons.
We’re Stan for stray kids and for stays also❤❤❤

Минхо весь выпуск 😳😍

They make our lives happier. These guys are miracle.
ÇOK KISKANDIM YETER HAYAT
The stays are amazing that's really so good especially the red light cover it's out of rating..  I like skz reaction it was so fun to see it 😭👏👏
Stray kids we’re so proud of them I am to good job to all the stays they reacted to♥️♥️
you can tell how amazed they're by how much they inspire other talented people
time for me to go cover youtiful or super bowl so i can get noticed my fave group👀
AAAA pls I love this
I kept getting drawn to Chan's facial expressions in this video. His face just reflects the intensity of emotions he is feeling to see talented people covering their songs. A humble and generous king who deserves the world and beyond.
the fact that chan has already seen the last one but still reacts to it like that is insane
So happy for everyone! Very proud of Stays and Stray Kids! Amazing job!
Aaaaaaaaa
I hope we can see them react to dance covers next time <3
loved this video omg
Red Lights has soo much covers, its a iconic song💫
this is so cute
Omg I loved seeing Lex in here! I'm really glad she got noticed for her talent!
Stray kids are gold... And they glow very brightly ❤❤❤❤
This whole video is so cute, God... Han's reaction is so sincere, his face is just like an open book. He didn't say much, but his body language said even more than words could. On 9:08 - he abruptly stopped shaking his head to the beat and moved closer to the screen because he knew about the high note, and when she picked it up, his whole body relaxed in a flash. It reminded me of the video of his reaction to MAMAMOO. His facial expressions and the way the music and sounds were like they were literally controlling his body... It's fascinating.
Proud of all talented stays out there. Talented idols and fans. I cannot imagine the happiness of stays whose covers were shown.
Impactada quedé
❤
I'm so happy that Stray Kids listened to Gaston and Lex. They both really really deserved this!! ❤
OMG LEX HI~

The red lights covers are a whole different level!!! Both made the song completely their own with their own vibe and they sounded so amazing!!!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
POV:  you can’t sing or dance 👁👄👁
I wish they would do a part 2 and react to covers of the STAYs of Brazil! Here in Brazil there are many STAYs and we would be very grateful! Gostaria que eles fizessem uma parte 2 e reagissem a covers das STAYs do Brasil! Aqui no Brasil há várias STAYs e nós ficaríamos muito gratas! 🇧🇷💚💙💛
I love this so so much. Thank you glamour. They are the best and their music is awesome. I’m glad so many people realize it

Han's stank face (appreciation) during Pimwa's cover was the best. Loved her voice.
8:33 im so happy for her
you should give us links to originals :/
This vid is sooo warm!!! Can feel the love between idols and fans💗💗💗Their compliments gave them so much encouragement!!!👍👍👏🏼👏🏼Hope to see more of this kind of vids in the future~!!

Man even Stays are talented as heck, Chan beng constantly surprised who put which language inside was adorable and nice  of him to point out, you would think growing up bilingual could make you forget others would have to learn that tongue.
The god menu ones gave me second hand embarrassment even tho i can't even sing a line
Who wants enhypen next ⬇️
I'm literally crying seeing meraculex here I feel so proud espesially when seungmin smiled approving and chan hyping her GOD I'M SOBING LIKE A PROUD MOTHER
im crying how many interviews did they do that day😭
AHHHHH I LIVE LEX!!!><!!!!

both the red lights covers broo
Congrats to those STAYs, very proud of you. And thank you glamor.❤
All the skz’s songs are full on bops I hope they continue to perform and produce more music for STAYS❤
Spanish yeeey
love them so much
Los amo<3
JUST LOOK AT LEE KNOW IN THE WHOLE VIDEO😭😭😭😭
These songs are not easy, by any means, but Stay managed to pull them off so flawlessly. Great job!!
10:38 cmon chan did u think we weren't gonna meme that face of yours. Bro was paralyzed
I don't think stray kids realize how many people appreciate them like everyone was crying when they were complimenting their singing and how they inspire so many amazing people       Love you, stray kids

This is making me teary-eyed! So rewarding to see stays react to straykids reacting to them. If I feel this way, I could only imagine it would be a hundredfold for them. I love how SKZ, since they make their own music, can even notice little things that each fan did to differentiate their cover. so amazing

These covers were spectacular. Every artist did a wonderful job of making each cover their own and adding some mala flavor to it. It was so touching to see them affected by Stray Kids’ reaction, and I especially agree with the last singer’s note on them exuding authenticity through their artistry.   Stray Kids and STAY all around the world, you make Stray Kids STAY!
