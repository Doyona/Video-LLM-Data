Come home Gundo💙
Watching this FA Cup Final, 1 Year Later, and watching the FA Cup Final 2024 when  Manchester United got their revenge by the same score line 😂
Anybody came back here after 2024 final ?
Ggmu see you blue fuckers next year to settle it. 1-1 on the scoreboard now
Reverse scoreline 12 months later.
If we did that last year hopefully we can do the same thing this year
Saturday please United. Please win.
Came back to see how we can beat them next week. This Man Utd team were way better and still lost. Its looking loong
4:43 relief for Jenas
man utd pls make wembley red this time ❤
Second chance united please don’t loose
Who is here after man utd vs man city in fa Cup final again
Captain fantastic respect 💙💙💙
Credit must be given to the goalkeeper, who actually moved during City's second goal.
Of all of the final 3 games of that season, including the ucl final, this one felt the best to celebrate
CITY still dominating Trafford United
I was still unpacking my food while watching this 😂
Come on Liverpool!
United are shit they no longer the biggest club in Manchester anymore the city is Blue 🔵🔵 unlike Merseyside which will always be Red 🔴🔴
Love the way Pep celebrated that second goal. Easy win for the champions, without needing  to get out of second gear, only gripe is we didn’t win by more. Rags lucky right the way through this FA Cup campaign, and lucky in the final to get another dreadful decision going in their favour when they were never in the game. Brighton would have been a stiffer test for us. MCFC Treble Champions.
Took him long enough
I'm not a city fan But this was fully deserved Well played City
both captains with goals
U should NOT b congratulating Man City AT ALL!!
Gundoghan brilliant 💙
Thank you Gundogan for the help in the treble and for your career😢
Best team won and really should have scored more
Bruno Fernandes is easily the most irritating player of all time.
Cheers Dave
It does not get better than the first 12s. Just doesn’t. Magnificent!
I have to dont get treble
the opener was a great hit but why did degea go onto his knee and watch it sail past him?  surely if he had time to watch it he had time to make some sort of dive at it  🤷‍♂️
Gundogan is such an underrated midfielder, especially when you think of other midfielders who get more plaudits: Grealish, Eriksen, Henderson, Mount. He's had more impact on the man city midfield in recent years, than any of those other players have had on their teams.
If the Arabs haven't sent suitcases full of cash to those who decide. Then Arsenal title United FA cup Inter Milan Champions League.
Fastest goal in history by a Muslim. Against the satan. Couldn't have put it better. Absolute screamer.
50k Sheffield Wednesday fans for the playoffs last Monday they have best fans in England they are insane
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
VAR trying it's best to give manure a helping hand...
Just a pity he can't play like that for the German national football team
It's almost not fair!
Iklay gundogan consistently scoring big goals in big moments season after season
As if people are criticising De Gea for those goals, ridiculous
Who said that cheats don’t prosper…
Support neither team but its nice to see city beating utd after all them yrs of them being on the wrong end of there rivals
Better team lost, simple as that (arsenal fan)
Mad to think man City were almost unheard of one time it was all about man utd, how is fergie sleeping ???
No need for that within 15 seconds 😂😂
The penalty call was absolutely shocking, there was nothing intentional about it, the guy just jumped and missed the header. Ref was terrible all game but well done City, another trophy in the bag!
The ref was bribed!
Untd defence is SHOCKING
Anyone else notice Gundogan was never given a winners medal.  They had run out of medals.  He only the Captain and scorer of the 2 winning goals.   !!!
The difference between a good player and a world class player is if they turn it up in big games.
Man city dominated what a lucky var decision united got.
Very Very Very soft penalty for United probably  the softest  all season.
Neutral, but enjoyed watching match.  I also won money for betting on a 2-1 scoreline so a special thanks to Messrs Gundogan & Fernandez.
Sergio gomes haaland gündoğan akanji are all dortmund players seems like city's new feeder club lol
Getting boring City winning everything 💰
rodri saving a last min equaliser
No one heard after the game Halaand telling Grealish "1 More" elite mentality.
harsh pen
Gundogan is that guy, he's always been that guy. Clutch everysingle time the big players go missing.
Anyone discussing their 115 charges of cheating to win? Rangers relegated for less and titles stripped.
Man City for the treble.  No English team has ever been more deserving.  I think they are even better than the treble winning Man U team of 1998/99
Defooo deserved Manchester is blue FOR NOW
Grealish should stop the diving etc. Spoils himself.
Never seen a man score two volleys out side the area with different feet in one match let alone a final. Guys on smoke. Easily top 3 most underrated ballers of this generation
Am Manu fan but oh my word city deserve it's two clean goal unstoppable
That first goal was saucey asf 🥵
Roma penalty was disallowed 😢
Well done City, hope you beat Inter too!
Up yours Coote and PGMOL! 😂
😮😮😮
Gundogan is literally yaya
He deserved a hatrick
Men against boys
Coty have at the moment the best midfield in the world
De Gea sucks 😂 at least stick your arm out
Some proper dedication from John stones at 4:50 heading the crossbar
4:07 how fodens ended up there and still onside shows how poor United defended
De Gea is the highest paid keeper in the world btw
Can we talk about Julian Alvarez? : ✅ World Cup winner ✅ PL winner ✅ FA Cup winner Champions League (most likely)  Alvarez has to be the highest contender for Ballon D'or this season (except from Haaland's goal-scoring record).
well done city well deserved 🩵🩵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
And this guy is best coach for Manchester United🤣🤣🤣
Joke that was given as a pen
Ngl im looking at de gea for that second…
VAR used there and referee got a second look. Was there a 2nd look in the league 1 play off final? Nope... Too inconsistent.
Never a penalty
An FM players worst nightmare, highlight from kick off!
That penalty wtf never in billion years
Utd have to be pound for pound the worst premier league team ever
John headbutts the bar 😅
Some first goal from Gundogan that , credit where it’s due
BBC covered up their Presenters graping kids on the BBC premises.   BBC also looked the other way for 20 years whilst kids were being graped by Pakistani men. Why do the BBC always protect the men?
Good audition from Gundogan for Arsenal 🔴
Treble on the way..Pep deserves it
Credit to Man City, relentless winners.
😂 Best message here is the message such dominance sent out to City’s detractors.
GUNDOGAN LOL !!! 😂😂 🩵🤍💙
De gea is fucking awful
Gundogan is too good, he can be shit all season but when it matters he turns up like no one else!
Maybe not enough credit for Ortega's save at the end, barely anything to do all game but did exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. Must be a great feeling for him to have played all the games in the cup and win it
Brest side in the world technically they are amazing
Never a penalty in a million years.
The first City goal was wonderful, the Utd. penalty was piss-poor in all respects. And wasn't it lovely to see Beckham's miserable face? 😂😂😂
Im a Sunderland fan  but man city  are  awesome  to watch
As a United fan this was an amazing game to watch that first goal was a great strike from gundogan and second one too United played a good game but it wasn’t enough to beat the blues of Manchester.Gundogan has definitely impressed me this season just from watching highlights overall it was a great game of football from city but we tried our best
Why would you title a Highlights video with who WON, BBC sport does it again use to do this crap with F1 too.
VAR again…
Football is 💀
why does the commentator sound like he's shaking
Both goals Prime De Gea would save. He watched the first one fly past. N the second what a weak hand he got on it. Really bad goal keeping. Sad to see de Gea like this. Even his passing n distribution throughout the game was shocking.
Bloody hand pfft yeah right the ref was blind 👇 city fans
Why didn't VAR interfere when Haarland punched Varane early in the second half . oh I forgot it was against Man U .
City best team on the day
Were the bookies even taking bets on this match?
How have man City gone from being a team who won nothing and kept getting relegated to a team that win trophies every year??
biased bbc didnt show man u highlights
why is nobody talking about city players getting let off for all the off the ball fouls and all the halfway line play-breakup fouls that are peps speciallity. we've been watching it for over a decade now, start giving yellows for it already zzzzzz
de gea is so bad
Fa cup winners bought with arab oil money.
Its Great when you can but an FA Cup and the Premier ETC.Etc,etc
Cheating s***y at it again another void cup along with the league.
115 breaches of financial rules. Even some Man City fans now know that all these trophies don't count!! 😅
How was that pen given for Man U absolute joke
Stones headed the bar 😅 Now that’s commitment
Someone check on old man Fergie if he’s still about, coz city are one win away from a treble an he’s gonna have a heart attack soon 😂
Cheats DO prosper...plastic club triumph again...the worst thing to happen to English football.
Think it’s safe to say City are the worlds best team, I honestly cannot see Inter stopping them in the final also what they did to Real Madrid was incredible absolutely battered them!!
Best thing ever in football when man u lose 😂
That guys got class,compare they way he behaves  to man united captain.
Worst penalty decision ever. Ruined the game as a neutral
Never seen so much biased comments by the two commentators in my life. Everything United did they had something to say but when city did something trying to not talk about it as much
De gea gets 350k a week 😂
Gundogan has become the Iniesta of Man City! What a sensational player!
de Gea is getting very static!
As good as an achievement the treble would be to go invincible is the one thing they’ll never do. No matter how much they spend
Over 100+ rules broken and still allowed to win trophies with a illegally put together team 🙄sad times to be a football fan. Why are they still allowed to compete?
United embarrassing
man united must kiss city feet to respect them being bigger in Manchester.
Liverpool was on for quadruple last season didn’t happen! Now city are on for the treble and they will do it! It’s a pisstake
Never a penalty!
Football comment section full of Captain Obviouses 😂😂
United are shit lol
Pathetic refereeing to give that penalty
Never a penalty.
That penalty was a absolute JOKE...
Never a pen. It was natural movement after jumping
i can honestly say the whole of the UK wants a treble
David Coote and Paul Tierney showing yet again that they are incompetent fools!
John Stones heads the crossbar and doesn’t lie on the floor for 5 minutes. Proper player
Embarrassing decision to award a penalty
United can't blame Maguire for this result.
Ilkay is incredible
Make way for the "underrated" trolls. Many have already been and gone but more will crawl out from beneath their rocks. Nothing surer
Can't blame the Man U goalie for the second goal
Glad United lost and old boy fergie witnessed it
Imagine being a defender and getting out of the way to block avoid blocking a shot - Varane 2nd goal
Contentious actions like Casimeros  tackle on Akanji and Fred on KDB not highlight worthy according BBC Rag Sport.
1 clear penalty to City not given for a Fred foul on KDB  If Grealish is handball then so is Wan Bissaka inadvertently handballing from Fodens cross, no review though, its completely ignored when its city - Its THE LAW or something  Outrageous red card from Casemiro on Akanji - decision - foul on Casemiro  The officials are an embarrassing shambles as expected after their antics earlier in the season at the theatre of screams deciding to temporarily suspend the offside rules and call it “the law” gaslighting football fans that know what they're seeing, and its corruption.
De gea is a liability for United
De Gea couldn't save a flipped pancake.
One of the worst refereeing displays ive seen in a long time.
Time to sell haaland he is now surplus requirement over sir gundogan
This is what United fans wanted. Rooting for city all season to beat arsenal to the title, now they’re going to win the lot and match/surpass all your achievements in a shorter space of time - you deserve this. Finding solace in your rivals winning everything? Could never be me
TOTAL CRAP IT WAS THAT GOAL JUST LIKE A FREAK GOAL YES CITY WAS LUCKY BUT NO WORRIES  NEXT SEASON ON A DERBY  MATCH SWEET REVENGE  WILL BE TAKEN I AND MY FRIENDS  SAID WE HOPE MU WILL HAMMER THEM 7-0 WELL HOPE SO OR NEAR ENOUGH  BUT MU NEED REVENGE  ANYWAY OUR CUP ROOM IS LIKE A MARKET  LOADS OF CUPS WHEN  CITYS. CUP ROOM IS LIKE A GHOST TOWN  ONLY THE  ODD CUP LYING ABOUT WITH COB WEBS HA HA ANYWAY CITY HAS TO BE LUCKY SOON TO GET THE TREBLE  WE GOT IT IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS 1999 BEATING THE GERMANS AND THAT WAS A MATCH SO CITY WE WILL SEE WON T WEU COULD BE LUCKY  OR NOT😢😢😢
the 1st goal, my god the worst defending ive ever seen, 2 CBs going for the same ball, erikson not tracking gundogan leaving him in so much space, terrible terrible defending.
Gundogan on fire man! 🔥 He smashed them in!
penandes
The UAE winning the Emirates FA Cup is the romance we're all in it for.
Hahahaha man u ant won shit 😅😂😂 well done city
Wtf is that 2nd goal At all
this was a snooze fest to be honest
Officials really  tried to help Man United  win
Gun is football version of Roger Federer  even looks like him
PENALTY FOR MAN UTD
another ref bought by united never a hand ball
Why does this channel always spoil the match by writing the outcome in the title ?!?! Why ?
City 2 Trafford scum 1
Hilarious reading all the online comments from the usual plastic United fans blaming Avram Glazer for daring to show-up at Wembley & double-daring to sit next to Fergie (the same Fergie who p*ssed off previous United shareholders so much they sold out to....the Glazers...!) & how only the Qataris can now save their club or else they'll be playing for a Top Four position in future seasons....😅😅😅
Ericsson and Fred were pure class
@joe synister whats it like having 0 premier league trophies, last title was in 1961, 0 trophies in 15 years. rob holding has more trophies than kane n son put together. 26 trophies in ur history arsenal have 22 more than you. arsenal 13 league titles spurs 2😂😂😂😂😂leeds, wolves, sheff wed, villa, everton, burnley, ipswich all have more or the same amount of titles as you. dont talk about my club again u man are nobodies.
We don't need to see it again thanks 😏😭😭😭😭😭🥺
Man united was so close in the last minute 💔
So where should grealish put his hand/arm, he's jumping in the air. VAR is the worst thing to happen to football.
i hope they get stripped for every trophie they had cheated them to ..
Don’t managers wear shirt and ties any more at cup finals 🙄
Special shout out to Jack Grealish for one of the worst dives I've ever seen to get Wan-Bissaka booked. What a melt.
100 points in the league might be more impressive then the treble maybe. Certainly more than any double.
2-1 was great Man Utd but City are too good
A total bore  with limited highlights.
Mr Clutch 👏
Best English side of all time. In 1 week this team will go down in history.
That second goal is De Gea mistake all over. Roy Keane is right, he gets praise sometimes for doing a good job, but he is so unreliable and unable to motivate the defence. In a game like this that was the difference.
English football at this point is like the ocean Vs 19 sand castles. Tune in to see who will win, it's anyones game! Yawn
No disgrace for Man U - probably up against the best team on the planet right now. They've come a long way in a year. Ten Hag is the real deal - give him another season or two and they will be formidable. A tight title race between City and United would be a fantastic spectacle!
De gea gets the statue of the month award for the 1st goal...🤣🤣😂 no wonder utd want another keeper...🤣🤣🤣
That opening goal was a real treat fair play.
Balti utd 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
southampton the only team to stop man city for winning all 4 trophies, but helped them win the premier league
Ngl may as well get used to city winning everything now in England lol… farmers league
Gundogan is fucking class
No way that Utd team is going in the right direction, Ten Hag is clueless
Rubbish final
Who gives a solitary shit
Another great game for Phillips to watch time to renew his season ticket for next season
Abu Dhabi has won the double. How thrilling.
MU were well beaten. Only one team in it.
its beyond me how City are allowed to win a treble with 115 charges. English football in disgrace.
Turkish power
City are definately very deep with some world-class players.
Gundogan isn't underrated. Everybody rates him. He's got that footballing IQ that you can't teach.
Gundogan was incredible today this was his final
Glazers are staying. Expect another decade in the dark.
How are Man City letting Gundogan go?
City just to strong 💪 unfortunately 😔, Best won 🏆 👏
Very polite of the Man Utd players to get out of the way of the ball for the second goal.
Gundo please stay!!! 💙But if you leave you’d leave on the highest note!
Can hear "Hey Jude" playing in the end. Imagine writing a song in the mid 60s, and then it goes on to be played at the FA cup final of 2023, with thousands singing along. That is what greatness looks like.....
Man said fifa kick off glitch irl 😭😭😂 only city can do such thing
The first goal will never be forgotten in the history of the FA Cup. The defending was terrible but who cares?  Sensational technique.
Did De Gea know he was actually meant to prevent goals? That's his job right? 😅😂
Is this the same team that cheated by breaking financial fair play rules?
United are finished,  they can't even win the FA cup. The club has been declining in recent years and it can only get worse
Bro when stones heads the crossbar 😂
come to barca iker gundogan!!
Did stone clear from the line
Classic De Gea Masterclass
Only Inter can save football now
That’s now 31 assists for kevin de bruyne, beating messi’s 30 assists from his 11/12 season. Incredible player
Dodgy penalty
Never a pen. I’m so sick of Man U getting help from officials. It’s as old as time.
When we won us the PL last season! Unreal!!
When we won us the PL last season! Unreal!!
WHAT A GOAL
Our first Manchester derby final & Gundongan breaks the record for fastest goal. From Maine road to this is inane 1 more we need & been chasing for a while now.
When ten hag said eras come to an end, I think he was talking about his own era 😂😂😂😂
Brilliant let's all laugh at Utd, especially when they said they were going to do the quadruple
big game gundo 👏
not a city fan but i love Gundogan
a poor game.
Gondogun second goal straight out of fifa 23🔥🔥
City buy another trophy with their £billions.
gundo is a cheat code!! one of the best fa cup final performances I've see
Made up city won that cheap penalty show how much the powers that be wanted United to win….. how on earth is that a pen he’s jumping in the air and not facing the ball from 2 yards away….. absolute joke. Didn’t want city to get the treble I feel it Man United like I also don’t want any other team to go unbeaten I feel that’s Arsenal. But now I am made up United lost and I hope they get the treble because of the corruption to stop City doing it…. It’s absolutely disgusting and shows how corrupt football is how did the ref think it was a penalty…..
Beautiful game from stones
No penalty! Absolutely bloody wrong! According to Lineker they’re going to look into the handball scenario and so they should - it’s pathetic! PS great game as a neutral!
The penalty decision was a total disgrace, that ref should retire
Rashford shit
I do not understand, they do not give 100% penalty in Europa League final for Roma AC, but give this penalty, when player was in the air in that position.
Manchester wins again !!
Kudos to Stones for literally headbutting the crossbar for his team, that's dedication and a lack of forward thinking.... I like it. 🤣
How did utd give him that much room for the second is childs play.
Operation Sportswash is almost complete.
how on this planet is that a penalty
When the highlights start with the kick off.... you know what's about to happen.
Best thing is knowing how much money these United fans spent, all the time they used for this match… just to be down 1-0 in 12 or so seconds. Brilliant. Hope it was worth it 🤣
That wasn't a penalty.
Why not show the casemiro foul
Varane is so trash
Never a pen
Ilkay clutchagan
13 Seconds with 5 total touches, that's insane.
Gundogan is so underrated bro
Dirty scum got the karma royally.  Enjoy being 2nd best in the City boys. Man city fully deserved that. Eth is getting found out.
haalands dissapeared
It is very hurtful to say, but the majority of United's team are very mediocre.. it's pretty depressing  when the only player in our team capable of getti g you on the edge of your seat is an 18yr old! And he didn't even start, why I simply cannot fathom. I admire what ten hag has done for us so far, but he got it wrong in not start I g garnacho.
Great first goal, but the penalty against Grealish is just ridiculous. The interpretation of the rules is I feel just bringing the game into disrepute and when you see the awkward and completely unnatural stances and postures players take to avoid a handball it's getting to be comical.
I think Man Utd dominated until the first goal.
Oil
Wow utd need a new keeper
Talk about a big-time player Gündoğan has been the man 🤘🤘
It does make me laugh to see manure play. I genuinely think that I would be better in goal than DG and I don't even play for my local pub team!
How did De Gea not save the second goal my days 😂
State of De Gea for that second goal
Superb!
As a united fan the United penalty wasn't even a penalty. Well done man city thoroughly deserved👏👏👏👏
The treble was nailed on as soon as they took top spot in the league from Arsenal. Real have been shocking this year so beating them was a formality and United have been shocking too. Easy CL final for City, well done. We did it first though.
How was that a pen anyway
Ederson must be happy wearing his lucky pants even thought he didn't play.
How on earth that was a pen I don't know. Where is his hand meant to go. Are players just meant to jump up with hand behind there back now? Man city constantly bringing in new players has help massively ilkay prime example of how you have to keep improving with so many new talent coming in.
BBC and Sky sports are absolutely gutted 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
No club could beat this good of a city team, they are unstoppable!
BBC sports,  City haven't won anything, they have bought success.  If city didn't have their mega-rich owners, they would be a mid table club or not in the Premier league.
ALEX FERGUSON RIP LOL DAVID D GEA GO LEICESTER UNITED
VAR IS SO INCONSISTENT City should of had at least 2 pens
Bernard Manning will be looking down smiling from ear to ear 😁😁
Bro if city win the treble, then definitely manchester is blue
Sad that Manchester United has not got the fa Cup 😢 .But congrats to Manchester City
Pep talks about being switched on to ever moment in the game, with doing things that are unexpected, having vision, urgency, tenacity, persistence and determination seeing half chances as a chance to score, these attributes have to come from within meaning you have to want it more than your opponents, these are all feelings.  First goal  Gundogan: switched on with  vision to see the opening and the unexpected volley, instinct , and the execution clinical. and determination to score with every half chance given. I have to say Brilliant. Man Utd were caught cold  Scoring a goal in the first 20mins that puts  your opponent under so much pressure to come back, Alex Ferguson was the master at doing that. You can coach exceptionally,  but, I think  you have to be able good manage players as well and Pep has both.
aslanim benim tebrikler
Fecking fantastic!
This gundogan guy is underrated af
The look on Alex Ferguson's face said it all and I was LMAO. Fantastic win for the noisy neighbours Manchester City.  Manchester is true blue!!!!!!
Empty seats in the United end and quiet all game but the media will never say it because they aren’t called city
Gundogan deserves Ballond'or if city win the treble! Captain fantastic!
That not a penalty
11-15 seconds  wow
Always rated Gundogan
Wel done you  horrible blue  bastards
BIG. GAME. PLAYER.
United made it closer than I thought they would but Gundogan was amazing & was the difference.
If they play like this against Inter they'll lose. Poor stuff.
city need to keep this 💎 13 second goal in a final must be a record and it was a screamer
Gundogan looks unstoppable, he and Man City are coming for the UCL Trophy!
I think both goals are de gea fault cause of his lack of movement and bad positioning.... Definitely his last game! Wasn't a handball and city were better than us plain and simple! We are a number of years being them
A truly great season for Utd…Caraboa cup…top 4… fa cup final….a treble.
Two highlights for me when City went ahead Fergies face  Beckhams face
Zzzz Man City win again, maybe I’ll start watching English football again in 20 years when majority of this team has retired
Fastest in a FA Cup game?
Slabhead defending
Manchester remains Blue
De Gea .....loooooooooool  Ballboy
VARland outscored Haaland again in this match ! No one is better than VARland ! What a striker !
Not all bald headed managers are the same, a lesson Manchester United have yet to learn. One of the most expensive squads ever assembled and nothing to show at the end of the season. Man united needed Ronaldo today and a tactical manager.
Never a penalty but a fair result nonetheless. In rugby and cricket the off field adjudicators can be heard by everyone as they explain their decisions when reviewing key moments during a match. Why not in football?
I must confess I searched another Man C VS Man U highlites FA Cup channel as I thought this was poor editing after 12 seconds of footage goal.
City fans singing we have pep...... they should be singing we have saudi owners.
If your a bigger headline than Haarland you must be good. He is player of the season in my lowly Scouse opinion.
13 SECONDS!!! THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!!!!!!!
Ilkay Gündogan. What a player
So that Grealish handball is a penalty, but Fernando's (Sevilla v Roma) last week wasn't??? Huh?? English referees should be ashamed of themselves.
Why didn’t De Gea even dive for the first goal? It wasn’t even that fast
Ilkay Gundogan is a generational footballer.
United are miles behind. The looked pedestrian compared to light-speed City.
You know what. Utd had one opportunity to stop their fiercest rivals from doing the treble and fucked it. Shocking
People claiming gundogan is underated are fuckin stupid LOL, he's literally your captain...
Inter Milan will beat Manchester City next Saturday!!!
It appears that money really does buy happiness.
Well done Citeh!… 🙏🏿
Never a pen and Casemiro should have been sent off - justified win in the end.
Why would you spoil the result in the title of the video? I really don't get why it's so difficult to write ''Man City vs Man Utd FA Cup Final Highlights''
I’m only ‘pleased’ because United are close to our (Arsenal) FA Cup record!
Cheaters are victorious
What happened to proper gold FA Cup Winners medals in red cases. I hate those silly gongs hanging round players necks. Look like chocolate money.
Inter pleeeeease
Man City winning everything! Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League!
Sad😢
It was not bad from Man United actually! Once they conceded after just 12 seconds I thought it is going to be another 4-0 😂😂😂
I think it's fair to say that Manchester United fans cry more than any others cry, and they have so much to cry about these days 😂😂😂😂
As much as I hate city what a bollocks penalty
Should never of been a penalty Awarded
Gundogan is one of the if not the best midfielder in the world. Hes been absolutely class.
Gundogan? Completed it mate
man utd are shit need a clear out, as for 5hity well money does buy things
Gundogan has got incredible skill!
Rashford pretending he was injured after dropping another stinker 💩
United fans showing what sacks of s**t they are leaving - you stay to watch the trophy lifted win or lose. was funny singing "You get the bus home " to the hundreds waiting for the bus home :D Edit = See Inter Milan fans for how to react & behave when you lose a final
Thank god this was also shown on ITV because jemaine jenas is an awful commentator. I had to change channels.
Roy Keane is such a know it all, De Gea has made so many good saves at his time at Man utd in fact many games if it wasn't for him they would be a lot worse.
Never a penalty, absolute joke and a great example of why VAR is stupid, how is Jack supposed to jump, like a lolly pop?
Can we sign Ilkay? 😂   What a player.
Wow gundogan scoring 13 seconds in what a lad he has been this game.
Where's the Garnacho effort? Come on BBC
Disappointed BBC didn't include Garnacho's shot in these highlights. It was very close to being a brilliant goal and skimmed the post.
How did Utd not turn up for a game like this?! What more motivation do you need to play out of your skin than city doing a treble?! So many weak mentality players in our ranks
Someone check on David coote he must be devastated that his match fixing didn’t work for this game
Well played city!👏👏👏👏 Definitely a penalty your arms don't go up on the way down from jumping
Good win but City will have to up their game if they want to beat Inter.
Boring final
I said Manchester would win it
That's not a penalty. VAR should be designed to get these non-sense out of the game, not increasing it.
Best City team of all time..... They'll beat Inter Milan too 🎉🏆🏆🏆
I don't understand WHY Gundogan is under rated.  Of all the players to be under rated, why/how him?  He has always been a world class midfielder.  I thought everyone knew, when he was at Dortmund that this was a special player City were signing. Or was that just me?
Ilkay was outstanding!!!
Varane was all over the place today
This was such a good game!😂
United were lucky to play in this final.. they did not deserve a chance to be here today than Brighton .. had it been Brighton, they would have won it from City and leave  out with one domestic cup and CL hanging in the balance, but united’s gift to city has put them as favourites to win CL too 🙄
Did nobody tell de gea that they stopped talking the knee at the beginning of games! 😅
De gea is pathetic
City was denied the penalty. And United was awarded the penalty. That was bullshit
Ah don't wanna see the cheating oil company win the treble
Gundogan scored again which can only mean one thing, everyones going to be saying he's the most underrated player ever
Went from underrated to easily one of the most clutch players in the league. What a player he deserves a treble 👏 👏 👏
Comon de gea are you joking with us
if gundogan keeps playing like this an scoring more goals he should be up for a ballon dor
Gundogan is CRIMINALLY underrated
De Gae has to go he just stopped and stood still for the first goal at least make an effort.
Wanted City to win so good on them, I’ll be happy for them to win the treble to shut up the other lot
Gundogan is so underrated at City he's been magnificent for city. It was poor defending by united for the goals though. You can't allow a player that much time and space.
Nice to collect on your bet in the first minute of the game. I missed it because I was still fixing my drink but I'm not complaining.
I hate mancity they suck
2 absolute belters, Gundogan deserves it!
Inter is the last hope now 😂
Typical city fans. Couldnt turn up for the semi final but everyone is there for the final 😂 well thr glory hunters
And the battle of the wallets goes tooooooo Man City ! Lmao 🤣
Nice one City! Beating the scum is always special. After their Disney Cup victory and all the talk about they’re back, pure comedy!
Irons!!!
all of citys achievements are just bought and fake , all corrupt at the highest level , 115 charges against them , can't win things the proper way spending money you've earned and self generated from previous seasons successes , get money gifted to them on a plate by a shiekh and spend it at will , didnt do anything didnt work for any of that money at all. likes of utd liverpool arsenal self generated their money and won it the proper way , no cheating or fiddling the books! can't wait until this club crumbles after the premier league throw the book at them , strips them of their titles and cups then their expulsion from the premier league , it will be a fantastic day. Fake club fake fans corrupt achievements
The best egg won
City did brilliantly considering they played against united the ref and var today. World class again from gundogan👏
Not even the ref and the VAR officials could win it for utd lmao
Can't stand either team but that's a very debatable penalty.
That's for the Stretford End banner you rag prats.  I hope it hurts a lot and next week....hopefully even more!
Justice prevailed today. Varchester United tried their hardest yet again to cheat but they forgot they needed to defend Gundogan at the edge of the box did they forget that he becomes the GOAT during May/June
Karma for Ten Haggle, they got owned LOL! That's what they get for treating Ronaldo like shit, if he was playing they would have won.
I swear gundo loves driving manual cars...he always seem to love the clutch moments
DEFUND the horrible 'BBC'
City at peak right now.  Can't mess with them at the moment..and hate saying it but got give credit  where  it is due. Can t see them not winning CL. Just on top form right now man.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Inter beating City It'll be like Wimbledon's victory in 1988
Unlucky Erik 10 Seconds
CITY CITY CITY!!! CMONNN💙💙💙💙
Manchester derby its funny i forgot about this match
“The Gundogan Final”
Varchester united got gulp gulp 3000 by the referee and still lost 🤣🤣
Lol united with a pen to score was all they did absolutely clueless haha Carling cup wasters
Amazing first goal 😊
City have broken my heart so much these past 5 years being a Liverpool fan, but thank god they won these scum. Well played City. What a team they are! Please take the treble.
De gea is soo good
good blues
We'll Be Back! GGMU!
If Maguire was playing this game would finish 4:1 to city 😅
Manchester is Blue and it will be for a very long so long as Pep is Man City manager. He just knows how to build a team. Like it or not. And you can talk about money but look Chelsea invested £600m over two transfer windows and look where they finished in the league in 2022/23. Face it Man City even look great when they play pause...but credit to ETH he has taken Man Utd to two finals in his first season and one 1 of them.
VARchester United
Let's hope they're charged with cheating..
Manchester is blue but good game Man Utd fans pls like
Give David De Gea a contact extension. We can’t let him go . He put his heart and soul into this match
Gundogan has been on fire this last month, brace against leeds, Everton and now united. Not only is he scoring but the goals he’s scoring are just outrageous
what a game
the fact we conceded in 12 seconds i knew it was over
pin me im first
115 charges treble ground breaking 🎉🎉
I watch this
First
