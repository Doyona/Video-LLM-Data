How Pete landed a SNL contract, he suk'd a cak****    He's not funny. He's not charismatic. He has a personality that really borders on pathetic.
2025 update they just got engaged.
As a swiftie I’m dying 😂😂😂😂😂
lol
Worst Howie Long impression ever.  Just don’t.
Timmaayy
LOLL IM DEAD WHEN TRAVIS POPPED OUT
Feel sorry for Keenan being saddled with this awful cast and if there is a God all the writers of this sketch were expelled from kindergarten.
Welp, now it IS a love story as they are now engaged.
Who else is rewatching after the engagement got announced? 🥰
I also thought Pete sounded like Gilbert Gottfried.
what is that skirt they sang  see you again
Cute! Writers you did good!
MAD TV SNL ❤
SNL MAD TV ❤
MADtv NFL on Fox ❤
I didn't tune in for football.  Didn't know what I was going to get, but hoped it wasn't football.
Jimmy Johnson impression was spot on
As a swiftie I find this both funny and offensive
Pete started out sounding like Gilbert Gottfried and then morphed into Adam Sandler.
oh my god Jason brother traivs klace
Foxmit, Make sure our rides are on point please. You didn't screw it up folks we just made it right.🦊🌎⛄🚗🚔
I usually fight back a little when people say the show has lost its way. I blame NBC they also made Colbert not funny.
ff to 2:20
Hahaha Pete likes 🍆
It's a love 💕 story 😅
I love that they let david wear what he would wear on the street 😂
Rip to everyone who was hoping for the chiefs to win so travis could propose after winning the super bowl 😂
He sounds like Adam Sandler and Gilbert Gottfried
Idiots🏈 😂😂😂😂
i fear they clocked us perfectly
ok but not the this live comment bc thats so every swiftie ik including me
As a swiftie i can confirm when they are talking about surprise songs that that was a very accurate representation
lol jets! They are the Butt Fumble!
i’m thankful for this sketch
0:11, 1:35, 2:23, 2:53, 3:33-3:54, 4:13
Not the way I squealed when Trav came on. Also me and Howie have the same reaction to This LOve
As a Jets fan, that is probably the truest statement I've heard. 🤣
How is this a year old
I love how Travis kelce got on there
why is kenan still allowed on tv? did the world forget about fat albert?
Guys I wouldn't be ok either if my BFF got This Love as a Surprise Song and not me, but them all singing Bad Blood has to be the highlight of this video😂
The Jets comment was scary accurate... Jets fan here 😅
Omg 😅😅😅😅😅😅  I'm dying 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel lucky, I got "This Love" also in Singapore Night 3.
That’s your job, Kenny!
This was very funny!
I come here at least once a month 😂😂
i can not tell you how much i love this skit
they really studied us HARD to write that script
OMG, that was fantastic!
❤ oh my 😮god, you got this ❤? Brilliant!!!
HOW DOES THIS ONLY HAVE 3.5 MILLION VIEWS?
This is one of my faves
Beyond fabulous!!!!❤😂😅🎉
I literally hate football, Taylor swift and uhh Andy keane child porn twin travisbkelce Omg Taylor looks so authentic like totally getting it
🏆
2:35 Pete lookin ready for the Chappell Roan concert.
I can’t tell if I’m offended by this or i love it as a swiftie
This will always be my favorite
Neva dat Howie 😯
I hate everything about this
Anyone here after TTPD. I feel like Taylor wrote this sketch.
I love that it was poking fun at the guys who keep bringing her up voluntarily
Now that TTPD is out, we need a continuation of this sketch
"THE JOKES WEREN'T FUNNY , I took the money My friends from home don't know what to say I looked around in a blood-soaked gown And I saw something they can't take away"  - "You're On Your Own, Kid" by Taylor Swift
as a swiftie with swiftie friends, I can confirm that this is a very accurate. and honestly SO FUNNY
I wanna shake hands with the Swiftie that wrote the script. 😂
WAIT!!!! no THIS LOVE is a PANTERA song...WTF
Thank you, Kenny. You have been the opposite of helpful
Hello. May I ask what did Matty Healy do?
IM NOT OKAY 😂😂😂
Damn she looks super old in that photo Pete is analyzing.
when the fk does SNL plan on being funny again? it's been too many yrs of this nonsense, SNL used to be must see TV now it's just musty tv
1:58 karma is abt Kanye lol
Its a love story baby just say YEAH hitting different after the super bowl
Oh em gee
Wow SNL fucking sucks
🏆
The secret songs part is so true every surprise song we will freak over if we did not hear it live  😭
Mikey Day's over the top fan boy was hilarious!
😂😂😭😭Swiftie’s have taken over football and I’m here for it!
They disrespected Terry Bradshaw lol
I love that duck dynasty comment
Oh my gawd
WOW, complete trash, can SNL get any worse? LOLOL
i still cannot believe taylor swift witnessed this skit with her very eyes
The absolute best besides Taylor and Pete singing about the The Three Sad Virgins!😂
Funny skit
3:59 “KNOCK IT OFF!” LMAO
i remember watching this with my dad on the tv 😭😭
POV: Me at school
Unfunny and lame. 👎👎😮‍💨
I just want to know why I have to see Vick….   🐶. I cannot get passed what he did.  And here’s Fitzpatrick who can’t even play 3rd string….
travis kelce .... please propose on 12/13.  give Taylor best birthday ever
🏆
fuking hilarious
4:08 You can hear people's reaction when Kelce walked in the studio lol That must have been fun
Come on everyone. Let’s not make fun of Taylor Swift. She’s proof that you can become a millionaire by incessantly whining and complaining if you make it a song.  She is a pioneer, as she has taken annoyance to a whole new level while reinforcing stereotypes that most of us prefer not to associate with.  Bitter crybabies unite!
Nice Footall style. We need the repeats.
I love how they are mocking us
Dude I seriously love SNL
.... i dont like talking about this game
Coming back to this after “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs” 😭😭
This is probably my favourite SNL skit 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😀
His Michael Strahan was great!
Because that's your job Kenny 😂😂😂😂😂
Pete doing his best Adam Sandler
ok no one has commented on the damn blue crew neck that was impossible to get! PETE!!!
Just that face from the thumbnail... How precious😂
🗣️they put Pete in THE BLUE CREWNECK iykyk
What a time to be alive
The blue crewneck 💀💀
One of my favorite players dating one of my favorite musicians. I love it. Go commanders btw ;)
I just imagine Taylor swift watching this and just dying laughing
Go birds
Let’s be real Taylor was the greatest thing to happen to the NFL (this coming from the kid who had the build for football and the push to try it but liked music and theatre so much more, and after 8 years of drumline and not knowing the rules of football, I’m finally learning)
I just realised that Pete's voice can mimic Gilbert gottfried to a tee!
Anyone else think Pete sounds like Myron Cope in this?
SNL is the least funny show on tv now. They must hire writers from rehab clinics
Amazing video Nice
Jeez snl is awful these days.
Nice
Keenan, the Anchor!
after the writers strike this is the best they've got? I'll die on the hill that whoever writes this show deserves to get paid LESS
y'all cray...
I would have just lost it. Just like the audience did when he walk out there on stage. And said his 2 words. So, spot on
1:16
Nice ❤
I watch this skit nearly everyday. Everyday. Every line is hilarious.  The pink on Pete & "...What were your secret songs? YOU GOT THIS LOVE?  OH MY GOD, I AM NOT OK!!" Pete's intro monologue was ❤.
Why is Kenan Thompson still there?  The guy is just not funny.  He's made me laugh 3 times in all his years on SNL.  He seems like a nice guy but they need to give that spot to a new guy.
I'm worried about talking about Taylor so much but my wife loves it and Travis Kelce was actually pretty funny when he hosted last season. That seems like common sense to me. He and Taylor make a great couple.
Omg, I love how Kenan just has to try not to laugh and Pete just pushes that button so much. LOL
you could hear the audible gasps from the audience as they were setting up Travis' shot while the other cast members were casually talking lol.
Absolutely outstanding sketch.
my dad is trav
this is the most fun PR relationship I've ever seen lmao
The fact the Jets actually won this game tho
HILARIOUS 😭😭😭
Nice video
I am glad that Taylor was present and most likely saw this skit in real-time.
Good
Ted Bradshaw is blatantly Taylor Swift in disguise 😅
Funny episode. Thanks Pete
Nice channal
This was actually cute
“Because that’s your job, Kenny”
fuuny when they say football and i dont see a thing about messi or ronaldo
Lot's of FREE PUBLICITY for Tay Tay and her concert movie in theaters!  Then the real Travis shows up at the end as the person who wants to talk football!
When Pete comes on, close your eyes and picture Gilbert Gottfried.
Nice
John 3:16
Where is Taylor? He thanked her in the end?
Pete Davidson is the new Fish from Barney Miller.
I did when he said it was a very formative relationship lol
Omg, I’m a Swiftie..I love how they complain and yet still cover
Why they do Michael Strahan like that, haha. Does he have a lisp?
Even Henry Winkler probably thinks that SNL "jumped the shark" here. Embarrassing!
How do yall keep luring Kelce on to this show😂😂
Nice
Good fantastic ❤
What is up with youre channel snl? I didnt get sny notifications at all that tall started uploading here
I'm one to usually defend SNL, but... Nah.
"And the jets who were cursed by a warlock 1000 years ago" lmfao
I WAS PHILLY DAY 2
the Matty Healy was so funny
This is great🏵
Saturday Night Live just isn't the same anymore smh
I love how you can hear the crowd react to
I love Pete’s Adam Sandler, Voice he learned well from the Goat
They were lucky they had this sketch ready. Travis and Taylor decided to drop in minutes before the show. He talked about it on New Heights
Is this supposed to be funny? Serious question.
I love that taylor was there and probably watched this skit live ❤
Love
Pete channeling his inner Gilbert Gottfried.
Pete doing Gilbert Gottfried
Taylor is so overrated!!
Interesting
🤣🤣🤣 Hebis literally going to jail for things alll related to his actions!! He's such a jackass!! How do they kepp suppythis narcissist psychopathic clown 🤡??!!🤬
Why are Joe Biden and Sean Spicer doing a football show
Kenan is just like Elvis going up on stage at the end Been there done that pay me
Finally Kansas has something known…😘😘😘😘😘 Rihanna and Taylor 😘😊
the audience did not keep their cool when travis hit the stage at 4:09
Mikey Day must be a great writer because I don't understand how he's lasted this long as a performer who gets as much air time as he does. His acting chops are pretty limited.
she’s so fuking loved
remember when taylor hosted. ABSOLUTELY KILLED IT. HER MONOLOGUE? wrote it herself.
I'm so happy I'm not part of the milquetoast middle America that is SNL. Any subject that takes a spine to lampoon, they stay away like the plague. They don't take any chances anymore. Everything is just liberal fluff that is safe like a warm blanket. It's disgusting actually.
As someone who is dating a swiftie, this was on point lol
Good
Strahan character is so funny lol
“You got ‘This Love’?! OMG, I am NOT ok!” Had me absolutely rolling!
Setting up kelce for when he gets cut
good
It’s been days and I absolutely adore this skit 😭🤣
How bad has SNL become? Seriously?
Pete is just imitating Adam Sandler.
Some sketches are too spur of the moment. If Taylor dumps him in the next 3 months nobody will remember this skit.
good bye TRASH
Good bye trash !
Horrible. My God….  Cancer is funnier.
The friendship bracelets! 😂
Funny😂love it ❤
I SCREAMED WHEN TRAVIS POPPED UP. HOW DO YOU KEEO GETTING THIS MAN?
I was really hoping for Kenan to think he was off camera and show off his bracelet thingys 😂
I would love to see Travis Kelce host again, and have Taylor as the musical❣️ I love when they parody football.  😂
too much talk not even funny
Judeo-Comedy is so cringe.
That was awful
Is this why the Jets won? SNL cursed em in a good way
“YOU GOT THIS LOVE?!?! OH MY GOD I AM NOT OKAY!!!!”
I AM NOT OKAY! He delivered that perfectly!!!
I played football as a kid, watch my Rams every game or at least getting updates if i work. But im also a taylor swift fan, not a swiftie, but i like her music... i ship Trav and Taylor.
Starting to wonder why I'm even here - me everyday 😅
Why does curt got my fuckin last name
This is hilarious. It's crazy she was in the building while they did this skit. I laughed out loud entirely too much.
This skit helps confirm why I don't watch SNL anymore! Talk about not even close to being ing funny!
Ugh. This Swift nonsense... nothing more than folks feeding & band wagoning off whatever the media companies hype up.
Mia Colucci’s hat (RBD Concert hat). Does anyone understand the reference?
Haha I was Philly N2 and those were indeed the surprise songs. Too funny
Snl probably make more revenue off of YouTube than cable.
Pete was channeling his inner Adam Sandler.
❤❤
Taylor is a serial dater. Pete is a serial dater. Hmm....
Thought the Michael Strahan guy was Pete for a second
I think they were awesome on SNL! Travis is such a gentleman, and so protective of her. Taylor has never been with a real "Man" that makes her feel safe & happy. Been a long time Fan of KC & Travis he looks so happy! Taylor looked so happy too! Love the popularity of New Heights & hope things work out for both of you. You both deserve it! @killitrav & @taylorswift.   My 16 year old & I are rooting for you both! 🥰
It was a formative relationship!
You can tell a real Taylor Swift fan write this from the little details like This Love
Man the writing is like Nickelodeon “All That” level. lol.
Remember when this show was funny?
How come Kelce did not put Bowen on the table like he did with Ego?
bro enough with the taylor swift. we don't care
Pete doing his best adam sandler impression
I have no idea wtf was it about...
My roman empire was Taylor on the audience while these men mentioned Matty Healy and Joe.
Lmao😂😂😂😂
And here i was thinking Taylor Swift wasn't that popular anymore 😂 guess I was wrong😂
I sometimes goad myself into watching an SNL skit to try and see if it's still terrible, bc i used to love watching this show....20 years ago. fu****** shit sucks so bad lol. Instead of comedians with any kind of chin, or grit, we have this fat theatre dweebs or sad emaciated forever boys up there making absolute fools of themselves. It's so corny, toothless, stupid, audience hating comedy.
Good
You guys really made my heart melt with this one
I love football but not so much her lol I feel kelce will have a song written bout him lol 😂
What a great collection of unfunny people and bad writing.  Snl is so bad these days.
+
That was great. It was like that "Family Guy" when the guys are sitting around making fun of Barry Manilow---before eventually fan-girling all over him.
3:45 😭 I was there, it was beautiful
Petes pink cowboy hat was everything 😊
No Michael Irvin?🤣🤣🤣
Nice
Amazed how people think SNL is funny today.  Everyone is different.
Cool
Jets ended up beating the Eagles
Good
Good
Omg snl is sad and pathetic
Weak sauce
Love Kenny's New York accent....
I don't really care who she's dating but something about Mattie was triggering and I love the hissing and the cross fingers to repel him. This isn't all that far off from some of the sports coverage.
Dude SNL blows now lmao, they really dropped the ball getting rid of Shane Gillis
Who knows I might get a working tv with Channels because of this…if I can ever afford it
😅 Looooove me some Taylor! ❤
I’m happy to see Pete at SNL
That lady gets paid to do this. She’s a crisis actor. She was literally doing the same thing decked out in Vikings gear.
I love Howie Long as a swifty
I am enjoying everything about this whole situation
BREAKING! Israel kills at least 500 in hospital attack.  Tuesday, October 17, 2023 (EDT) Time in Washington, DC, USA  Stop war crimes in GAZA. Stand with GAZA...  #palestine #Gaza #israel
as me being a eagles fan and a swiftie, I’m just like Pete davidson
Devon Walker was so flat and boring last season. I'm glad to see him coming into his own! He was the best part of this sketch for me.
well done molly!
So did they go home together, or...
I just realized skeet completely copied Adam Sadler whole style
This is so great! Tbh I didn’t even realize SNL was on break, but now I’m really glad it’s back. I’m laughing my butt off at the sketches from this episode As a football fan and a Swiftie! This made me laugh 😂
Real talk tho to the Swifties in the comments, what are the children's bracelets all about?
Okay you leave Matty alone, SNL lmao
Why does Pete think he’s Sandler
We're getting off the subject here😂
Where in fuck is my face paint🤡
I'm a die-hard football fan therefore I now like Taylor Swift
Pete’s next girl
About time. I have sketch Idea where everytime nick wright has the camera on him. His voice goes up an octave
Really Thank God Travis and Taylor were on the show my God how did they ever persuade them to come on
I don’t get any of the references, but could infer the humor from the audience reaction!
Tsylor Swift music sucks she cat sing and she looks average
As a Chiefs/NFL fan wife to a Swiftie husband this is so accurate. I’m sick to death of them discussing Taylor this much but my husband is loving it AND loving that the analysts are getting into it and revealing that they’re all swifties haha
(Reposted)   Someone should tell Kirk Cousins listening to a song in the locker room isn’t the best way to win football games these days. Rather, he needs to find the Viking who Lizzo dated, get them back together, and get the NFL to start secretly paying her to show up at games, (rudely skipping one every now and then without an excuse). Then he’ll get all the refs on his side and never lose a game, (like what’s happening with that overrated plain jane blond singer from the Kanye West “Famous” video, and that adrenaline junkie tight end, who should get an Oscar for his two second SNL cameo over the weekend), lol.  He just needs to make sure it doesn’t continue to the point where football turns into pro-wrestling…on second thought he should forget the circus act bologna and just play good football.
I never thought I’d be saying this, but they’ve really run out of ideas
I have not watched SNL in 25 years. From this 5 minute skit I can see I have missed nothing. Brutal! This show was done along time ago.
Can you imagine how successful this show would be if it were actually funny?
Lmao I love it how they imitate them. It the male version of The View
Pete's face reminded me of Roland Orzabal of 1980s band Tears for Fears.
Woh this one was horrendous
Pete Davidson is the fifth former longtime cast member to host the season premiere of Saturday Night Live. He's an awesome host. 😂😊😅😊
“Issa ❤ story baby jus say YEAHH” 😂😂
Pls can you help save a fox with saving 500 foxes 🥺❤
the jets joke is under appreciated, gets me every time
Lol cursed by a warlock 🧙‍♂️
The new cast members suck so bad!! 😂😂
😐
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Love the easter egg of Pete's character having "13" on his hand.
The quality of this show has gone downhill so much. Like, the green screen isn't even a video.
Pete needs help
Waaaat?
What happened to the game I love?
Kenny sounded like Adam Sandler
This is my American revolution
I love that Travis literally just walk on set with the same outfit he was wearing that night 😂
Bring back Chad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pass
hail Reagan?
the matty healy joke😭😭😭
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information. I am not affiliated with this website or ministry, they are simply tools that I think may help you!  https://jackhibbs.com/know-god/  https://jackhibbs.com/real-life-basics/
I almost feel like Nick Kroll should sue for Pete stealing his Gil character voice
Only SNL can have the person who they are making fun of doing a cameo appearance.
Pete Davidson is now Gilbert Gottfried?
Keenan is NOT funny. And why does he do a fake voice all the time. He changes his voices all the time it’s SO annoying. Get him off the show
Smh
Comedy for simple minds.
Not funny...ugh..
Someone should tell Kirk Cousins listening to a song in the locker room isn’t the best way to win football games these days.

Worst Jimmy Johnson impression ever
I’m so glad I only watch college football cause I would hate having to hear more about Taylor swift than football when I want to watch football 🤮
Thank You #SNL You made me Laugh this past weekend. Laughter brings Healing. ✌️❤🌍
The Matty Healy comment kinda pissed me off 😂😂😂 I adore him
i just KNOW taylor was laughing her ASS off at this skit 😂😂😂😂😂😂
im sorry im from helsinki and dont know anything about football so can someone please tell me who that guy at the end was?
It was the Matty Healy comment for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor Kenan.
Pete Davidson is horrible
I have a hard time watching snl these days, usually just watch weekend update on here...that being said when Travis hosted I thought the American Girl sketch was great
Travis here keeping the tea hot ❤
You can tell when Travis walks on stage off-camera because the audience gasps and squeals while Kenan is talking. Too funny!
The guy olaing stragan got his lisp down pat!
hi
3:52 BYYYE THIS IS SO ME
Damn they shoulda had pete play mahomes sister 😂
SNL sucks. It has for 20 yrs.
Was Pete supposed to be Gilbert Gottfried in this impression? I have no idea who else that was supposed to be
Hmmm. 🤔
Kenny Ditullio giving STRONG Nick Kroll Big Mouth vibes 😂😂
Travis IS easy on the eyes.  😏
They did Strahan so dirty!
JUST GOD AWEFUL.
I haven't laughed this hard since Travis was at the American Girl store. 🤣🤣🤣
This was hilarious, but I was hoping they were going to go to a female sports analyst that "actually wants to talk football" since the gender is still controversial in the industry.
I just know some real swifties are in the SNL writing room. Keep the Taylor content coming!!!
Kenny looks a lot like george santos. Acts about the same way too.
I'm sorry but Micheal Straham's lispppppp. Nothing wrong with it but boy you got it spot on. Hahahaah
Pete sounds like Gilbert Gottfried.
I love how you can hear the crowd react to Travis showing up at 4:08
Pete was channeling Gilbert Gottfried just a bit!
I haven't laughed that hard in ages!!!!!!!
It’s Week 6
Jets beat the Eagles- still can’t believe it 😢
What an impressive Strahan impression
Was not expecting to laugh during a modern SNL skit
Bye Eagles, Bye!
If SNL were BRAVE they would have talked about how football gives 99% of their players CTE and 25% of kids in high school footbal. They go on to at worse rape, kill, abuse, suicide because of the destruction of the frontal cortex. At BEST they get Alzheimer and become drug addicts and various other problems. Anyone who supports this sport is a monster and well Israel is at war so.... #signoftheapocalypse but lets address that this makes fun of Taylor to her fans because anyone who cares, cares about her music. BUT you have to care about her relationships or her to get this joke. And well... who is this written for teen girls... wait... The Inscest monologue came before. Yeah who is the Audience for SNL? I've lost almost all respect for this show and only out of pitty for a friend in need am I writting this. Eventually I will have to move forward and grieve the loss.
Football has become the great unamerican sport.
This is phenomenal 🫶🏻🩷
Awful. I'm glad Keenan from Keenan and Kel is making money from this though. Peter Davison isn't funny and this "sketch" should have stayed a sketch.
How do people find this shit funny
I am HERE FOR THIS 😂😂😂
Enjoy your 15..
SNL is so irrelevant now. Congrats for being so woke though. 🙄
I wish people would shut up about the overrated Taylor Swift.
SNL sucks
I’m so happy I didn’t understand all these taylor swift jokes.
I'm old enough to remember when SNL was funny.
U got "This Love" I feel the same!!!! I love that song!! ❤❤

at 4:08 , you can hear when Travis hits the stage and the audience sees him! they're trying to control their shock haha
What if Taylor wants to ditch singing and just want to be a football mom????😂😂😂😂 😊😊😊😊
TBH I wouldn’t be surprised if Terry Bradshaw was the biggest Swifty of the bunch lol.
Pete sounds like Gilbert Gottfried
All terry Bradshaw commentary is accepted. That guy is awful on TV
Reminds me of that time I went to a Taylor Swift concert and a football game broke out...
Glad the strike is over
❤❤ Mikey D. really captured Howie's surly tone of condescension. His moment of eruption was the crew of his cut.
This gave mad Adam Sandler vibes
Too lol
I find Taylor Swift incredibly bland and her dating life, at 33, is getting old.
SNL producers and script writers are finally realized that Molly Kearney is not funny at all so they wrote minimal script for her/she/they/him/whom
SNL is not funny anymore, maybe it’s because of cancel culture, and Pete Davidson is really not funny at all.
How could these be the best skits the SNL Writers could come up with after 5 months?
Pete Davidson could do a good Gilbert Gottfried
was this supposed to be funny?
Well that Jets joke didn't age well
That Strahan impression sent me 😅
What's awesome is how great Teavis Kelce and Tay Tay are embracing the attention. They are having fun too. Two great people (at least from what I know about them and their out of the spot light lives. Which isn't a lot.)
Davidson is hilarious.
Thank you Kenny. You have been the opposite of helpful.
So who actually thinks this is even close to being funny?
So well done.
Pete gives me big Sandler vibes
Pete Davidson doing an Adam Sandler voice. Come on. Do your own shit
Funny thing about Bradshaw is that he was the backup for Phil Robertson at Louisiana tech before he quit to go duck hunting more often
That was a good Bugs Bunny impression by Pete
How do yall keep luring Kelce on to this show 🤣
the guy on the end could play  Ross Peru I really spell that lol
The response to matty Healy is so funny
sorry but idk I found this soo.. humiliating. she is a woman who dated a raci*st anti*semitic islamphob*ic and kept trying to hide it. idg why she didn't get a backlash for it like others did
Travis is like the next Pete Davidson.
Lol Aaron Rodgers and danica Patrick😅 and now kelcee n Taylor Swift😂😂😂😂😂
Great Micheal Strahan
I'm still upset my Eagles actually lost to the Jets!
Best sketch of this season, and it's not even close...
Does anyone remember when SNL was funny? Me either.
Pete’s Pink Cowboy hat was everything
I love she was there watching this lol
Lame
The Jets Joke 😂😂😂😂😂 💀
holy crap this show is terrible.
????  No idea what these guys are talking about.  What's 'Joe'?
Wow this show is awful lol
I love how the Jets actually beat the once undefeated eagles too 😂
EWWWWW SNL is back?🤢🤢🤢
So this is SNL huh.   Well that’s special.     Seems like they don’t have writers anymore.
This isnt funny.  SNL is the last show with a laugh track.
#freepalestine
People who love the NFL...... 👇
booooo
Really going deep on that Katie perry's/Jets conspiracy because shes for green but flys in private jets its hilarious that comedy can be manipulated into brain control. Stay safe outthere.  John Conner
J E T S JETS JETS JETS
That’s an awesome astrakhan impersonation
ABSOLUTELY love SNL for this like a swiftie def made this skit TOO GOOD
OMG. And I thought because it was football, this skit would be boring.... 😶😆😍
snl is boring as hell nowadays
This was the best skit ever!!❤😊
Bunch of sell outs.
I have no idea what they are talking about and if this is really how taylor swift fans are im sad for this country
I just got off the phone with the Eagles fans. They said they want you to stop trying to talk about the game.
It also adds one more level to the humor when you think about the fact Pete used to be engaged to a pop star nearly as big as Taylor and her dating life was a big deal to tons of total strangers too.
Love that right off the bat he's telling the Swifties this show may not be for them, and then halfway through you realize every guy sitting behind that desk is being portrayed as a Swiftie.
The only weakness of this skit was Molly Kearney and it was good that she(?) was not given much dialogue.
Omgoodness hilarious 😂
Let’s admit Taylor put KC on the map. No one knew that town even existed…..
Not to sound old but Melenie had a better voice and at least wrote many of her songs..
5 months off and this was how they open...sad.
Jets at least have won a SB UNLIKE MY VIKINGS!
Bread and circuses  at its best
Fuck this one stings as an Eagles fan.
How does this video have over a million views and only 20,000 likes?
I love how these guys are fan boying Taylor Swift shows like my Dead Head bros!   That had me laughing hard!😂😂😂
"it's a love sto-ree,..". 😂
Script was  Spot-on .🤣 ☑️
Pete 😂💓
Everything was funny until Pete came back.  What were y'all thinking?
Taylor swift is overrated... There i said it .
I have no idea who any of the people they're referring to are.  Other than I've heard of Tailor Swift but don't know any of her music.  I'm old I guess.
...And then the Jets go and upset the Eagles the very next day 20-14 and experience much joy!! 🤷
WE F****** WON BABYYYY GO JETSSSSSS ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️
I blame Keenan for jinxing the eagles
How is this funny
THE JETS WON! First time the Jets ever beat the Eagles.
cool
this is epic!!!
Pete winner 💗
I don't think Davison is funny at all ! Saturday Night live is not even close to being funny with Davison as THE GUY!! He's just goofy!! Not a fan anymore.
https://youtu.be/PWeQRSKf1Iw?si=pG7MN2fx5DI-lFS-
Holy shit this bad.
We just can not get away from this…like her music that is forced upon us all…
SNL, being completely not funny per usual
Jets won lol
So sick of Taylor Swift. Why is she so freaking popular?!
Wow Pete could do a great Gilbert Godfrey
Man they wrote this shit Down shared it with each other and was like oh yeah this is it this is the one 😅
funny how i really dont care about her at all. no clue the rumors they are talking about. next
Keenan gonna be on the show till the sun burns out
Can’t believe the Eagles lost with the Jets being cursed.
That was an hysterical skit, Travis at the end was so cute.
SNL jinxed the eagles lol
SNL fans will you go to heaven? Ever lie, steal, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? Still think your good? According to God's law, you're guilty. Wait, God loves you, he made a way out. God so loved the world that he gave his son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Jesus died for you, believe & repent.
I feel like I'm the only person on the planet who was disappointed to find out Pete would be hosting. They bring him back before they bring back Kate Mckinnon? Whaaaat? Pete is not funny. I've never once laughed at him.
His outfit is giving me 1989
It’s week 6
This show sucks now. Not even remotely funny.
SNL blows
people think this is funny?
Pretty much what it was like. NFL is a joke
Pete sounds like Gilbert Gottfried
NBC taking shots at Fox? 😊
Who’s that guy at the end? They never said his name
I like the fake laughs.
When I say all your problems disappear watching this! I mean it😂😂😂
Couldn't host at the best moment after the writers strike...He fully went in there. Mentioned Ye, covered how SNL is obsessed over TS + T.Kelce - like the rest of ther world. As well as mentioning how everybody ABSOLUTELLY HATED Matty Healy too. AND managed to put Travis Kelce in the skit too? Pete, we adore you. And we adore SNL. Plus TS+TK pics/clips arriving on SNL afterparty & them hanging out with Pete! ❤❤❤
Mikey perfectly channels Dana Carvey's delivery style! 😄
I saw her playing in a coffee shop in Reading before she made it big.  She was probably like 14 or 15 at the time.  My favorite concert is probably Rush in 2009.  Montreal.  Mac Sabbath at The Foundry in Philadelphia was fun too.  They're a McDonald's themed Black Sabbath parody band.  With songs like Frying Pan, Cherries are Fruits, N-I-B-B-L-E, and Pair A Buns.
This was the funniest thing I have watched in awhile lol.
Way bigger deal than the thooper bowl😂😂😂
As a true blue Philly man.  The Birds will never be good enough.  They could be the pat's and they wouldn't be good enough.
The nation that elected Joe Biden and made 25 superhero movies also thinks Pete Davidson is funny. And they say that we're continuously evolving as a species?
Was Pete imagining what it would be like to be raised by Gilbert Gottfried?
Pete Davidson channeling Gilbert Godfrey!
😷 I wonder whether #MichaelStrahan has watched this yet?
I sure hope Keenan is getting paid a whole hell of a lot, because man does he deserve it.
"The Son of Man is coming!"  are the words to be heard soon by the whole world from the Arch Angel Micheal during the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first thing I want you to know, whom ever you might be, is that God loves you.  I don't care what you have done in the past.  I don't care of the mistakes you have made.   The blunders we all have.  He loves you, I want you to understand that.  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn.  In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus. I am going to pray, and I want you to pray with me.  Saying words cannot save you, but if you truly believe in your heart, you will be saved. And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart.  And the Holy Spirit will dwell in your heart and you will become a new creation through Jesus Christ.  Let us pray...  Dear God in Heaven. I come to you. I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived. The things I have done. Please forgive me. Cleanse me. With your precious blood. From every sin, I have ever committed. Right now, with my mouth, I confess, the Lord Jesus. And in my heart, I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead. And I accept Jesus Christ, this very moment, as my savior, my redeemer, and I make Him the Lord of my life. And right now, I am a new creation, I am washed, I am cleansed, I AM SAVED.   We ask this all in the name of Jesus. Amen.
I’m old enough to remember when SNL was actually funny.
I want to know who’s funding the news coverage on kelce and swift
Not the Joe and the whatever that mfs name is joke 😭😭 and karma was written when they were still together, loved it
Pete does a great impression of Gilbert Godfrey
Forever and always and This Love?! I am not ok!! 😂
Not funny at all
iconic that they were both there for this skit. so good.
This was awesome, so glad Travis and Taylor surprised everyone 🥰
That joke on the jets aged well
Is this an all Pete episode or something?
Whatever they did helped the jets win lol
This is as funny as a kid in a wheelchair.
God SNL still sucks and continues to limp on.
Missed opportunity to use bad blood (security guard version)
Think it’s time for Wayne’s World! WE’RE NOT WORTHY!
I'd have to say Pete does not even look even a little like a Jew. Maybe Irish, but not a Jew.
I’m not sure why but the way Kenan says the name Kenny always makes me laugh
Wow this was SOOOOOOO NOT FUNNY!
Try to laugh challenge.... Ft Pete Davidson
Love to have Pete back oml
Somehow the Jets did it
Pete Davidson is doing adam Sandler. Ok
The secretary skit had me rolling lol the actress (type her name if you know it) and Pete really nailed it! I'll  be tuning in more often. :)
As a huge Pearl Jam fan.   Swifties.  Rock on!  Nothing like being a part of a great fanbase.
IM FUCKING DEAAAD HAHAHAHAHH
Good god SNL has fallen so far.
He sounds like Gilbert Gottfried
1:26 -- "Knocking back cocktails with Deadpool"  LOL
Pete Davidson tries so hard to be mid-90's Adam Sandler. This sketch is just further confirmation.
It’s amazing this show is still going the past 5 seasons have been the worst in all of its history
Ok...came on to trash the show expecting to tell the new generation they should watch SNL from the 80s...BUT, this is brilliant, so there. I will be back next week to trash the show --JJ
Surprised that Pete Davidson hasn’t taken a shot at Taylor
Lol SNL wish they could pull in those NFL ratings.
Yo is that Kel?
im dead, who among the snl writers is a swiftie on stan twitter 😭 and they took shots at matty & joe while blondie was there???
ALL THE REPUTATION REFRENCES!!!!!!
Geez, this is unwatchable.
Is Pete Davidson’s shtick that he’s a less funny Adam Sandler?
I was expecting to laugh. Totally let down here.
Mr Pfizer
A perfect Michael Strahan! 😆
This show has gotten really just…not funny.
All these people all of a sudden caring about Travis Kelce when theyre gonna doxx him when they break up like he was nothing before.
In what universe is Keenan funny?  Wtf snl
While SNL makes cheap jokes about celebrity dating drama, The Adam Friedland Show manufactures it. They are not the same.
Dude why is he complaining, HE GOT CLEANNNNNN
Terry Bradshaw looks more like Ralphy May. :P
Jimmy looks like Trey Gowdy!!  Come on SNL!!
so good too specific
Pete sounds a lot like the Sandman....
Jets are cursed by a warlock for a thousand years that will never experience joy 🤣  🤛
This was probably the original Cold Open before the Saturday Middle East stuff
After so long of not being on the air …. You’d think the writers and cast would have come up with a better show ! This SNL sucked worse than Lauren Boebret at a Beetle Juice musical …. Don’t even get me started on the musical guest . Geeeez!!
Lol I loved it all but it was the Michael Strahan impersonation that was really funny.
The Michael Strahan impersonation was hilarious!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
The reach of cumtown is amazing
Please don't take the Lord's name in vain.
Why is Pete Davidson in black face
The accuracy! 😂😂
https://youtu.be/e0LFDa9GkQE?si=zBcoUmDHTvyu3K7e
wow a non political SNL for once! - i actually smiled at this one. nice work!
Mickey dey's reaction at 1:32 killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
SNL!! Excellent play!!! I see you😂🤣😂🤣🤣 The whole skit was everything! 👏👏👏 Well played!!
https://youtu.be/uYeLBqwSvEI?si=nhNKtwgcha1ZZe8I
Yalllll wrong for that😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love the detail of Pete wearing the blue sweatshirt EVERYONE wanted
Should update the video title so get taylor swift fans watching too
Man I want Keenan skin routine I need his secrets seriously
Oh? My God?
Travis Kelce was actually very funny when he hosted last season which to me implies intelligence. I think him and Taylor make a great couple. I just hope she doesn't have to write a song about him one day. 😭
Not funny
LOVE THIS!!! 💜🕊
Pete Davidson is the least funny person to ever grace SNL. His face though😂😂😂
Pete Davidson is horrible.
James Brown needs way more forehead showing. 😂
Love this anout TAYLO SWIFT!!!
That was hilarious!  So good!  😂
Pete Davidson sucks!!! Go back Kim K. And leave comedy to the real comedians.
Too funny😂❤
Them having the bracelets es so accurate and I AM A TOTAL SWIFTY! Love you Taylor!
This was a bit too accurate for me. Why is snl involved in our family matters?
What a terrible terry bradshaw.. hang it up SNL
this is awful. Comedy is dead
Skeet
i doo owe them... soo... wait,... just once right?
Brought to you by PFIZER.
WHY DID THEY CUT TRAVIS OFF?!?!?!?
Davidson is the most unfunny SNL alumn by far.  Lame to the core.
Fan of both. But let's remember the cold opening... This is about humanity focus... Not a relationship that isn't yours...
Terry Bradshaw 😂
Anyone remember MADTV's Fox NFL Sunday sketches, with Jordan Peele as James Brown, Frank Caliendo as Terry Bradshaw, Ike Barinholtz as Howie Long, Frank Caeti as Jimmy Johnson, and Arden Myrin as Jillian Barberie, plus Keegan Michael-Key in one appearance as Terrell Owens? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX6kdE8mEao
Great skit! 😂😂😂
the way he got his hands on the blue sweatshirt
Did the ghost of Glibert Gotfried posses Pete Davidson
SNL sucks so bad now. 😂😂😂😂
It's like Pete Davidson was channeling his inner Gottfried and Sandler at the same time.
Not funny or even amusing
Believe it or not, but this show used to be funny.....
Hilarious
April 2019
Pete D appeared in skits about 3x more as a host than he did as a cast member… just saying
Who is this Taylor Swift person they're talking about
THIS IS TRAYLOR'S WORLD - WE'RE JUST LIVING IN IT!!!!!
This was great 😂😂😂
Yes, so nice to always see Keenan!! Like seeing an old good friend…
Terma had the finest women on the planet. They wanted me to literally do less work and move around. My first task was MS Paint. I went to a couple bars.  I started learning, ViM ?  They almost kept at the first location, when the goal was to move me to the Atlanta office, contingent upon employment.
Pete Davidson looks like Sam Britton from the Biden camp.😊
I LOVE Keenan's "KNOCK IT OFF!"  that sent me into peals of laughter!!
Ice Spice sucks
Not even Travis and Taylor could save this ep. You'd think during those 5 months they would've came up with some solid sketches
I walked into a gay bar in 2019 and didnt know it was gay
Hey Pete... my buddy Christian Cage has been wanting to talk to you for some reason...
SNL wasn't canceled? It's not funny.  It's like staring into a toilet 🚽
As a swiftie I feel very seen by SNL 😂❤
Lolol. Travis and Taylor planning date night: "What you think about doing some cameos on SNL?" 🤣
Why do these fucking teams keep going for 2 when they don’t need to….. It’s so fucking stupid Oh,I know why Because the NFL is fucking rigid
That one "they" is so stunning and so brave!! They need to make more skits about non binary people that's what really important
Wow. Snl still sucks. Kill the show.
WRITERS DID THEIR RESEARCH 👏👏
This was hilarious!
wait wait why is this so accurate
LOVE IT !!!💕
SNL is no longer funny.  Its best years are in the past.
Dude nailed Strahan part.  LOL 😂
This is so pathetic... not 1 bit was this funny
This is SO GOOD.
whatever swiftie was in the writers room nailed this
SNL doesn't even try anymore
https://youtube.com/shorts/NSbSZWHDu1M?si=ht7CIETyheyzrwjQ
Pete mixed Gilbert Gottfried and Adam Sandler in that one
Bowen Yang has been sitting on this one for so long
Pete channeling Adam Sandler is unoriginal…. And also not funny
Bruh the secret song part I felt called out lmaooo. The accuracy hahahahah.
They seem to forgot that Taylor Swift is a Eagles fan because she's a Philly girl before she moved to Nashville.
Kenny looks like Colorado coach deion Sanders he's a joke😂.
Okay, Kelce is such a stud, oh my gosh, gorgeous!@#@!!!!  And then we have Taylor Swift who is absolutely beautiful.  What a pair!  As a woman, I'd tell Taylor to just play this one, have fun, and take advantage of being with this gorgeous stud, a man's man even, for sure a woman's man!  Oh my gosh.  He's also a funny guy.  Hunk stud, funny guy, absolutely gorgeous face, absolutely gorgeous body.  Who can ask for more?  I wouldn't worry about anything else, not even emotional investment.  Just have fun with this guy.   And Taylor herself, using her platform to spread love and inclusion, and who truly cares about those who are marginalized in our society, love her to pieces.  No wonder this hunk made a cute friendship bracelet for her, off the scales awesome!  What. A. Pair.
She must be loving this!  Finally, some kindness!
Tim Dillon is the swiftest swifty ever
This shit is for idiocracy snl rip
😂❤  love this so much!  I’m actually a really big fan of football, but I just want to say that since Taylor Swift is on a hiatus from her tour, and she found a great way to market herself by using a Kelsey bro into marketing for her own brand.  She’s pretty self-absorbed and so unreal that she’s actually a laughingstock to everyone.  Except, all of these young swifty fans that spend so much money to watch her at all times.    I watched an interview with the Mama Kelsey and being asked about how she thought about Taylor.  Her answer was she thought she was okay.  There was no way that she showed any signs of her actually liking Taylor at all.  She seemed so authentic where she didn’t show love for Taylor at all.  She said well she’s okay, and that she really doesn’t know her personally so she really didn’t have any idea about Taylor.    My thinking is that she’s earning a lot of money and attention through the wrong way of manipulating her brand.
It’s a love story baby , just say YESSSSSS !  - LMAO
THIS is literally the funniest EVER. LOVE love love!!!!!!
I’ve never felt so called out in my life lmao, I have quite literally said at least 4 of the lines from this skit in my life before, it’s too accurate
Best.Hat.Ever.
this is not funny
Not playing music or at least static tv channels is disturbing bugs Vs birds War.  We are technically in the way
We didn't get a single Chad video and I'm pissed
I never noticed how close Pete sounds to Adam Sandler when he’s yelling obnoxiously. A really good voice double!
I miss SNL and man Keenan is one of the last good players of SNL after Bobby left!
SNL is dog shit
why does pete davidson have a blue crewneck but i don’t
We think of death every 5 minutes, independent of mental health
SNL..not Funny...and who cares about this crap.
Pete Davidson is definitely a dollar general imitation of Adam Sandler
Oh I'm so funny, look at me I'm taco bell kid😂😂
I think they are cute as a couple, i don't understand why ppl are hating on him.☺️ it's great to see a multi grammy award winning artist supporting their team. ☺️ That being said, team Jason all day every day, Fly Eagles Fly 😄
I liked Taylor more before the voice coach erased her southern accent and she wasn't so much into the alcohol. Plus, now you have to take out a loan to buy a ticket to her show.  Once again fame and fortune has claimed an innocent soul. We loved you in Nashville once Taylor and won't forget who you were back then.
Jesus Christ
Trying to find any humor here. Nothing.
This Whole war started with single people vs people in relationships.  Started meritously, ended wrong.
Uncle Travvy!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
When will SNL get entertainingly funny again?
It’s ok Matty moved on too 😌🫰
The Michael Strahan was on point 😂😂😂
Here for Taylor Swift and Travis 😂
That’s true! 😂😂
Came here for Kelce, stayed for KENAN! ❤❤
Good thing the writers strike ended.  I’m not sure what we would have done if SNL never aired again.
Ooff, Pete Davidson...... You guys came back from strike to give us Pete as the host? 😅 Wtf SNL?
Pretty awful show. Heidi is amazing tho
I puked in the garbage can till I could barf no more.
😐 I miss the days of SNL actually being funny.
Pete Davidson sounds like Gilbert Gottfried
Man snl sucks balls
I guess Davidson needed some cash to get him through the month.
THIS is how you do Swiftie jokes! Spot on. This was so well done 😂😂😂
Hilarious perfection!
‘Because that’s your job Kenny’, was delivered perfectly 😂
Pete Davidson absolutely Sucks! This was a brilliant sketch then he pops up on the screen with is chromosome deficient Adam Sandler impression and completely ruins it. 🙄
SNL is not funny.
Too funny! SNL has been so funny lately. Kenan Thompson always knocks it out of the ballpark..
I predict the Swift's career will peak when she starts dating Pete. 😅
His definitely loves the attention 😅😅😅. Let's hope it's a good match and not a showmance.❤
His jacket tho! 🔥🔥🔥
Pete’s yeah, had Sandler vibes all over it.
This was great 🤣
Loved his cameo and Devon did a great Strahan impression
Travis drip is top tier. He dresses like Pete Davidson wishes he could 😂
So funny!!
Sigh … this skit wasn’t funny
Snl is trash now
Devon is spot on with Strahan
Future Travis Taylor.. She's the beard in this relationship
Snl used to be funny
meh.
Scabs much

Omg 🤦 does anyone have a life in this comment section? Its amazing people care more about who attends the game rather than the actual game. Its simply a woman who eats, farts, defecates, and urinates. Bleeds once a month. She can even smell like b/o and have stinky breath. Like North Koreans over kim jong un
Been a Chiefs fan for as long as I can remember! I had a man crush on Travis long before Taylor came into his life! 😅
Please fire Mikey Day
They need to just end snl this shit is trash as fuck
The one homie with the glasses is the most over the top and not funny try hard. Also Pete Sandler ova here.
Awful. What a schmuck. How far snl has fallen. Glad I don't watch it anymore.
TAYLOR SWIFT IS GARBAGE...REAL TALK!!!
LOVED IT!
This skit was terribly unfunny. The new cast is just awful.
Kelce showed up just for that?
Pete's inadvertent Gilbert Gottfried impression is surprisingly on point.
Taylor and Travis on SNL on the same night, I love it. I love them together. This skit was hilarious.
Great show last night, love Pete Davidson
Wow. Legit surprised.
"Thank you, you have been the opposite of helpful" I'm going to use this one.
Not funny!  What has happened to this show.  😢
Im a swiftie and i aproove of this sm its so acurate
I didn't get the jokes, but I don't know anything about Swift or football.
Taylor is using kelcie like a tampon  To get people to take the vaccine We seen this grift B4 Anyone remember the J-Lo n Ben aflak to promote a stupid movie as soon as that was over they were over
Very DELICATE
“The New York Jets, who were cursed by a warlock a thousand years ago, and they can never experience joy”😂 It’s good to have you back SNL
this is th efirst snl skit i've laughed at in years. "they're taking their time and i think that's great"
Pete in Lover era 😂
Dating a football player? Lmao not as deep as you would think with all her romantic bs 😅
😂😂😂😂😂
This was hilarious
Art imitates life in this one. Yikes 😬
Love it! I;m going to the movie TODAY!
Haha
You have been the opposite of helpful ...
Apes together strong 🦍🍌 😎
definitely going to the eagles game w swift
🥱
Bwaahaaaa Pete 💜👏
Is that Ross Perot or jimmy johnson
As a chiefs fan I have no idea what they're talking about
Not a Swiftie by any means, but this was funny 😅
The hiss after matty Healy 😂😂😂
When did snl get a laugh track.
Perfectly describes being a Jets fan AND being a Taylor Swift fan!
Is this Travis saying he will be at the eagles game with Taylor today???
Does anybody actually find Pete Davidson funny?
Kenan looks great. He is so cute
“So far no sign of Blondie, startin’ to wonder why I’m even here!” “Because that’s *YOUR JOB*, Kenny. You are a *FOOTBALL ANALYST*!”
Mom is so jealous of Taylor cause she took away her attention.
Let's go Brandon!  🙈🙉🙊🤑
Pete's trying to angle himself into the lead role in Gilbert Gottfried's inevitable biopic, isn't he?
NOT MENTIONING JOE😭😭😭
Why is SNL still on TV?  What a bunch of useless nonsense is anybody laughing except the candle after I hear in the background this is stupid.,, SNL has it been funny in over 20 years
From context clues I feel this skit is hilarious. 90% of it is over my head.
The Jets getting cursed by a warlock made me audibly laugh 😂
It would’ve been easy to just make a bunch of “lol Swifties be crazyyy” jokes for the entire skit, but, as a Swiftie, THIS IS LITERALLY HOW WE ACT 😭😂 this is so scarily accurate it’s not even funny
Skit that only Americans can get
Pete could play Gilbert Gottifried in a movie about 1980s SNL.
The comment about Travis not being her boyfriend is hilarious knowing that the two of them were in the wings watching this 😂
It is clear that one of the cast members actually worked on their impression.... sad
This show has gone to sh*t. Lorne Michaels needs to go home.
Is this supposed to be a comedy sketch? This is more of an AD
Pete Davidson is not funny. Wannabe Adam and Gilbert
First it’s my favorite sport now these two dweebs are infiltrating my favorite show. Make it stop.
Who writes this crap?
It is a miracle...Pete didn't crack up in s sketch.
You really missed an opportunity with having Pat Mahomes on this
hard to believe they dont take any shots at mumbling, stumbling, Confused, and clueless Biden.  I know its a democrat thing but hes definetly bad enough to incorporate
There comes a day when you stop getting some of the SNL pop culture references.    😢
Molly Kearny as Terry Bradshaw made me laugh the moment i noticed. Before anything was even said.
Pete almost sounded like Gilbert Gottfried.
Saturday night Livive is Back..... When I played Running Back for The Orlando Orbit it was a great year we made the playoffs I got Injured but WE made it to the championship game....Madden 🕛🍟⏳
I only watch snl for pete
lol great skit!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Before long, Taylor will have more money than the Catholic Church.
Marianne Williamson 2024
Omg that Strahan impression is amazing 😂
🤣 Love these kinds of skits, like "Driver's License"! ❤
This had me rolling 😂😂😂
"IT WAS A FORMATIVE RELATIONSHIP!!" 😂😂😂That man can deliver a line like no one else!!
How is this skit funny....... oof..
Loved this!
Good sketch, and I love Pete, but a Gilbert Gottfried impression seems like an odd choice?
This show was terrible ..sorry
I remember when snl was actually funny
Ok, that was great 😆😆😆😆😆
PLEASE, no more Kelce, Mahomes, or Deion.
Goooo Jets🎉
They didn’t even just make jokes for everyone they made jokes the true swifties would enjoy and get 😂
How is Keenan still on this show
Mikey Day is back! Thank Gosh! I thought he was leaving at the end of last season.
Does anyone know if Travis can swing? Asking for a friend. 😂
I don't find this guy funny at all... I even try to give his stand up a chance and I only got 15 min in and shut it off
I couldn’t even stand Taylor swift enough to watch jokes about how she has absolutely  nothing to do with football and is getting shoved in peoples faces.
This show is way beyond tired…
I'm here for Kelce
Pete Davidson is hilarious
As a SWIFTIE I approve this, beyond hilarious 😂😂😂💙💙💙
I didn’t even laugh once. What’s up with this week?
Listen, i know all the swifties here are fanning out and all, but lets not sleep on Devon Booker. His impersonation of Strahan is hilarious 😂 😅😅
Did *NOT* anticipate that cameo...
My dream was for someone to dress up and make fun of me on snl. Pete Davidson you nailed it! I hope all my exes see this and think of me everytime they watch a football game 😊
None of them look like the people they are playing...or even acting like them
snl is funny agin who else cheered
God this show is so bad
I didn't  know this show was still on television  .
Pete sounded like he was trying to be adam sandler
secret songs 💀💀
Pete turning 'Love Story" into a cheer! 🤣
I knew this would be about Taylor 😂😂
This was great! 🫶🫶🫶
Man I miss when SNL was actually Funny
Davidson is a talentless fool. Was glad when he left the show, does not deserve to host. 😒
greatness im so in love 😍😍😍😍❤️
Can this be a weekly thing? Might get those ratings back up.
Glad that someone in the mainstream poked fun at this because we football fans could care less if Taylor Swift or Ghandi is in the box seats. Stick to football.
I think Kenan Thompson is somewhat underrated.  He has a quirky sense of humor — he’s got this sarcastic thing going on — and excellent comedic timing.  But I think he’s been on SNL for a very long time and it’s nice to have at least one steady cast member.
Has Taylor ever Hosted SNL?
This is brilliant. Got me invested, and I have never listened to a whole Taylor Swift album.
Keenan’s impression of Curt Menafee was spot on.
AYY PHILLY NIGHT 2
F#@K YEAH!!!❤🏈⚡💋
So glad they're back 😂😂😂
Howie long is so annoying
The girl playing TB is hilarious 😂
Michael Strahan crooked teeth and same way of talking is perfect.
I worked both Taylor swift show's at Ford Field in Detroit & I can't lie it was lit 🤣🤣🤣
I ended up hating the Superbowl because of the type of people that NFL courting now. Now I have to deal with it the rest of the year?
Jimmy Johnson playing Jimmy Johnson.  The man can do everything, I'm tellin' ya.
When "Fox NFL Sunday" merges with "The View." Haha!
The accuracy 😂
Pete was ok SNL writers are horrible
“The New York Jets who were cursed by a warlock a thousand years ago and they can never experience joy.” 😂
Oh my gosh, they dragged the exes, I can't believe my eyes and ears. 🤣 SNL is back full steam!! 🎊 And I love that Taylor and Travis were in on it. ❤
Kenan kills me 😂
I saw Devon Walker and for a second there I thought they did something really offensive with Pete Davidson.
Omg probably one of the best skits you’ve ever done! 🏈🏈Touchdown!
this week isn't funny....
The gasps when Travis must have entered the stage moments before his one line…
Once again, Kenan hold the sketch together.
Swifties are calling Kelce “father” on TikTok. Can’t tell if it’s a bit or not.
Best SNL skits in years have all involved Kelce!🔥❤️👏🏻
The two worst American products: NFL & Swift
Thank you for this skit! Glad to see Pete doing great on SNL again and for the combination of NFL and taylor swift.
The Matty Healy name drop is crazy
They really threw Matty out there too😂😂😂
The Michael Strahan impression is gold 😂
I’m dead 😂😂
This was supposed to be the cold open (with Travis Kelce saying “Live from New York…”), but of course, they moved it to after Pete Davidson’s monologue.
The acting was on point in this sketch. Everyone had their A game. Very funny
The fact both taylor and kelce was there 😂😂
This man caught a flight to say two words 😂
Dude you dudes are not funny, No body likes to be full of shit and me I don't have All that kind of problem falling for (sh) it
Travis💞Taylor, Awesome!
As a Swifties, I love this!
🔥
❤ #87 T. Kelce! Go Chief's!!!
Yes, please 'Chiefty' here!!! Best skit in a long, long time.
Welcome back, guys!  I missed the show so much!
as a swiftie preach
Snl is so bad now
Travis and Taylor should host together, Steve Martin and Martin short style
Strahan impression got me...doesn't usually work but that one did 😂 Keenans "costume" suit is actually a cool look...or I'm old 😂
Nailed it!
Too bad they now use a laugh track. Miss the real laughter of years past SNL.
Oh man I know the Swifties are going to love this one.
@OTCinderella you wrote this, didn’t you?
Best sketch of the show.
The SNL writers clearly have swiftie relatives or friends. Man, the lore they somehow know 😂
Davidson tries to sound like Adam Sandler in this skit, but just doesn't quite pull it off.
Patrick Mahomes was the most famous player in the league, then Travis said hold my beer bro.
Terrible season opener. Just flat not funny. Pitiful
This was supremely done!!!
I'm with Keenan, I'm absolutely sick and tired of trying to watch football and all they can talk about is her. If it was a Taylor Swift mention drinking game, we'd be passed out before the 2nd quarter.
Yes! Travis!!!
I am just loving this!!!
Sounds like Adam Sandler lol
I actually hope Travis Kelce hosts again. Some of his sketches were really weak, but you can tell it's because the writers weren't sure how he'd do. Credit where it's due, though, he's got some comedy chops and was willing to commit to the bit, even if it was weak.
you can tell this sketch was written by a swiftie 😂😂😂
Don't get it
Tell me why does Pete sound like Gilbert Gottfried in this sketch 🤣🤣
Pete sounds like Adam Sandler
Did a 13 yr old autistic girl write this sketch?
Mr. Pfizer does it again!  😃
Not funny
Is that Melissa McCarthy playing Terry Bradshaw?🤔
Noone else commenting on him sounding like Adam Sandler and Gilbert Gottfried?
Travis' clothes givin 1989 vibes
Kelce couldn't even say anything cause the crowd was so loud 😂
How are you going to surprise us with Travis Kelce and only give us 1 SECOND of screen time?!
The way they said this with her in the room lmao
can you imagine if the actual nfl sunday analysts argued about this? lmao
lmaoooo
Pete Davidson sounds like a cross between Gilbert Gottfried and Jim Carrey !
was not expecting that ender 😂
So am I officially the last one who wouldn't be able to  name one TS song or even recognize her from a photo?
Travis Kelce is gonna be the next football player turned movie star mark my words. The dude has it all and his comedic timing is excellent.
🤣🤣
Thst was funny! The new guy playing Michael Strahan was my favorite. I
they did Michael strahan dirty lol
How can you do an NFL sketch with Pete Davidson in the house and not have him play Mike McDaniel?!
Yikes.  Some of the worst impressions ive seen on snl.
Football fans are insufferable
So accurate. Football people upset at her constantly being talked about while also constantly talking about her.
SNL hasn't been funny in:  a) 10 yrs b) 20 yrs c) 30 yrs
Thank gawdddddd SNL is back letttssss goooooo!!!
🎉NFL gets the last laugh🎉
no bmore Taylor Swift we don't wanna see her damn face around no more cuz her fame and popularity is overexaggerated just as a big fat balloon by the mainstream, you know
I was wondering if you would mess with the whole Travis/Taylor thing.  I am glad you did
It’s weird hearing the women scream for Travis in the end as if he were some pop idol. Do women actually find him attractive?
This would be funny if it wasn’t exactly how the NFL has been acting.
How the fuck does the red head keep popping up all over? She’s literally if Xanex was a human.
The Michael Strahan is spot on and hilarious !
Pete is getting closer to Taylor 😂 I like how they were so spot on with every  rumor/ meme online
Taylor Swift's music is bad. Is she paying for promotion or something?
It’s so on point, could’ve mistaken for an actual sport news 😂
Booorrriiinnng 😕
“Don’t say that name. No.” ❌ - accurate.
I can't believe SNL made Pete McDonald wear black face as a commentator for the NFL.
Any SNL skit, which has Taylor Swift as the topic is a total waste unless it is completely trolling her and her psychotic followers. She's really not good.
The only decent thing here was the Strahan impression - this is what happens when writers strike.
When James Austin Johnson said “it’s gotta be me”, he slipped into his Trump voice and it caught me so off guard.
This is surreal lol and I love it sm
No way they got Trav lmao. That’s my tight end man🗣️🙏  Pause wtf
I’ll bet he’s in NY to watch his brother play the jets and that’s why he hopped on
DUDE AMC to the moon better buy now
Pete only has like two characters
“Not everything has to be about Joe” 💀💀💀💀💀😂
Dang this episode has the greatest vibes
Great job Pete❤❤😂😂
Later: “OMG, did you see that? Aaron Rogers miraculously recovered from his injury after being struck by lightning and scored the winning touchdown! Wait…what do you mean this didn’t air on TV? Taylor showed up after all. Oh, ok. I’m getting angry tweets already.”
…Is this f***ing play about us?
Bruh I hate the nfls obsession to swift lmao
Is it me, or is Pete starting to sound like Gilbert Gottfried when he raises his voice?
it's like looking into a mirror bcs me and my friends are exactly like this😭😭
I'm dead... I can't... Screaming, crying...
Does anyone know why the audience groaned when Kenan said “heated East coast rivalry?” Legit question lol please keep it civil
Devons energy was so good in here! I've laughed out loud!
Pete.
I'm a Swiftie and I approve of this message 😂
I remember when this show was still funny in the 90's.
damn
RETa%ded Shit, as usual.
being cursed by a warlock actually makes sense for the jets
Nailed it! 👏🤣👏🤣👏
My conversations are clearly being bugged!
ITS THE NAVY CREWNECK FOR ME
Couldn't crack a single laugh at this skit even if I were paid to.
mad bc pete davidson managed to get a blue eras crewneck and i DIDN’T 😭
This skit was painful to every Chief fan! We have to hear this bullshit for the rest of the year! We will never hear about just football again!!
SNL fucking sucks
This was hilarious
Strahan was spot on😂😂😂
Lol not them mentioning Matty Healy 😅😂
😂😂😂😂
the rumblings in the audience when travis got on stage ahahaaha
That was cute. I loved it. :)
I wasn't expecting the Travis kelce cameo that hilarious 🤣.
Massive football fan and it’s totally spot on how the people who complain about seeing too much T Swift are also the ones who keep bringing her up
I love that Taylor was THERE and probably watched this skit live
Garbo.
The tooth gap 😭😭😭😭😭
Too much Pete. It’s enough already
SNL costume department you guys always deliver.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I mean I've heard Taylor's songs etc, how are people this obsessed 😂😂 jk
Swifties wrote this sketch. No question.
I loved when they said their concert cities & nights because that is what everyone is doing on twitter
Love that they managed to get Taylor and Kelce on the show tonight, highly anticipated these type of jokes to be made but I like that it was more of a crazed Swifties approach than a gag a Taylor serial dating men
Dr’s prescription: An SNL after party should take care of any pain associated with that ankle.😉👍
Adam Friedland
Oh he’s gorgeous!
Hahaha Travis Kelce loves all this hahaha such a well timed cameo.
They didn't use the famous NFL on FOX theme music.
this made me so happy i almost skipped this sketch cause i dont like football and i thought it was serious at first and then it was abt taylor!! that was so perfect i love it so much!!
Please.... She ain't all that!
God tier skit
True Travis u cannot mess this up 😁
I just farted and it stinks less than this sketch
They have given Pete more skits on this episode then they did his whole last year as a cast member.
lets go eagles
Why isn’t Travis playing streets of rage 2?
Pete is very Adam Sandler coded here
Why is Pete trying to be Adam Sandler so hard..
Brilliant.
God, I love that man!
Bad blood and clean being huge 1989 songs. MetLife night 1 being the night she launched karma MV. So I think she is telling us which videos she made new music videos for lol
okay but as a swiftie its surprise songs not secret songs hahaha
There's no shot Travis flew to New York to be on SNL, right?? He just filmed that in KC surely.
Wow, who rights this crap?
I actually screamed when I saw Travis Kelce! That was great!
Is Pete back on the show?
i feel attacked
Not enough Kelce screen time
Taylor Swift > 🏈
travis at the end was the icing on the cake lol
It’s a funny coincidence that Taylor Swift made a brief surprise cameo on a SNL skit Pete was a part of last year, so I guess it’s fitting to have Pete’s skit involve Travis making a cameo as well.
lit cameo
The last 40 minutes of the show tonight was terrible!!! Didn't see the first part of the show- was it any good?? This NFL skit wasn't bad but wasn't good either.
Ok but how did they snatch the blue crew neck
shit the Matty Healy joke omgggg💀
Strahan ....llllol
Fabulous and fantastic job, guys
No Aaron Rodgers impression, because they’re talking about the JETS JETS JETS
uhh, I have no clue who that dude in the last seconds was.
this is %100 accurate
….hmmmm….where is George Santos when you need him for some extra crazy?
James Austin Johnson playing Jimmy Johnson.
somebody there has got to be deep in swiftie twitter to have this written 🤣
Snl soo poop
As someone who doesn't watch much sports I would totally see this
😂😂😂they wacky doodled the swift freency so hilarious
Pete’s Pink Cowboy hat was everything. Thank you Kenny, you have been the opposite of helpful
as a swiftie this is actually how we act 😭😭 the only time i feel like snl got it right
mikey day i love you
👌
Kenan always makes the same stupid voice in every sketch.
And just like that!   This will have the most views.
THIS IS TOO GOOOODDDD💀
No way Travis Kelce 😭🤚🏼 he has the greatest humor so I’m sure he agreed soooooo fast! Hahaha
pete davidson on his adam sandler arc
I’m shipping Pete and Tay
ugh... why do people keep talking about that talentless plastic doll? just stop it, i get she's the toy of the moment, but she is nothing special and then she will be flat out nothing after they find the newer shiner model...
This is great. Writers came back fresh and getting paid! Thanks for coming back!
Not a Swifty really, but still time for her to pop up on the show! Taylor, she’s everywhere you want her to be! 💚💙
Ugh I didn’t care for Taylor before and now I really dislike her. This is so annoying lol
Pete tho 😭
Devon's Strahan is on point...
lmaooo matty catching strays
Welcome back Snl 🎉
Hope to see More of Pete 🤘💯🥃
Pete really channeling Adam Sandler vibes and it’s awesome
I wish I were Taylor Swift.  I would love to see Kelce make a rough tackle
Louis and Andrew love some 13+87=100 :)
Wow, never thought I'd ever side with a football fan (Kenan). 😅
Saturday night live greatness
The Matty Healy comment 😭 whoever wrote this knows us
IT WAS A FORMATIVE RELATIONSHIP
I am not ok 😂😂
Pete Davidson never disappoints and love the pink cowboy hat on him. 💕🤠
I was here
As a TayTay fan, I'd like to say this sketch was a real Goaaaaaaal!
Knew that T swift drip would be there lol 😂
I knew they were gonna do Taylor
Was so expecting an actual T.S. cameo at the end.
All my swifties  👇
That pink cowboy hat brave lol
love the cameo and petes t-swift drip
Wow I’m early here
Finally he gets the screen time he never got
me when football
😂
How do yall keep luring Kelce on to this show 🤣
