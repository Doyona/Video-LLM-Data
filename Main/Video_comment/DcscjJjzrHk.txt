I can relate to Viv, glad she become a successful indie.
Меня позвали сюда из Пин. А-хах-ах
IF he dont treat me like Brandon treated Viv I dont want anyone
Brandon is just blitz at this point😂😂😂😂
He just gonna run over people’s front yard like that??😂😂😂 It’s such a Blitzø thing to do it killed me😂😂
WHY AM I ONLY SEEING THIS NOW!?   ....The algorithm has failed me...
He looks so much like Randy Rainbow here
0:31 not the voice crack when he says her last name 🤣
Helluva boss is a masterpiece
Oh look, he drives like me.
Vivian  Awesome 😎
What how did I not know you where in helluva boss, i gotta stop doing heroin
humorism and electro swing jazz? Plus HB? Heaven exists.
I just wanna go home
Viv doesn't deserve having Brandon in her show
Vivi was scared and embarrassed
I AM crying!  ;_; so beautiful.
0:27  Me when I go to my bestie house :
…pUT ON SOME CLOTHES 0:07
Viv: BRO WHAT THE FUK IS HAPPENING RN?
lol
1:12 I'd die. I'd fucking die. 😅
i want to animate this so much lol
The Blitzø puppet is killing me.
He acts like blitzø irl 😭❤️
Brandon is so blitzo. The most blitzo blitzo in existence
I can just image Brandon going up to Viv and saying "Hey do you mind if I run over your fence and scarecrow for a skit?" and her going with it.
多少誇張してるにしたって、どうしてこれ程までにブリッツのソウルを持った人間がこの世にいるんだよ 開始10秒で笑いすぎて一時停止したわ
Did she see Brandon Rogers videos? Because holy crap blitz is so much like him
eu queria morar na cabeça do brandon JJJKKKKJKJJKKKKKKKKKpqp😭
none of this feels legal to be completely transparent
I swear this made me roll off my bed
Lmao got it so Brandon is blitzo
OH NAHHH
Dear Viv, Thank you for watching this show it's really Stupendous Cool.  I just want to say I LIKE YOU Viv just the way I Be.  Sincerely, Devin  PS: Tell Erica Lindbeck say Hi.
0:01 I love how we blurred the Honda badge like we don’t see that it’s a civic
DJ blitzø hit the beat,don't tell me what to do mother fucker
Beautiful. I didn't realized the deep stuff dried up because you were switching to fucking TELEVISION. God I love you😂
Vizy have that look of what did I unleashed upon myself
1:19 THE O IS SILENT ASSHOLE
Lmao im late to the party love this
Brandon is my spirit animal :3
NO FAIR, I WANT MY OC IN HER ANIMATION!

Brandon it looks like when your singing to her she looks like she wanna go jump off a cliff
2:18  not her in the back..
Jesus loves you all
That be funny to see a live action  helluva boss ep for April fools day
Yayyyyy
2:14   “I just wanna go home” is valid
1:29 vro is hitting th chromakopia💔🥀
I was working my minimum wage job today and I saw a woman who looked exactly like Paulette Jones. It was wild and I had to not laugh and stop thinking of her parts in Brandon's videos
0:39 😂😂😂
helluva  bossssssssssssssssss
I can't believe they really make blitz as his human self to do that 0:27  and also that poor scarecrow😢 0:49
Viv looked so uncomfortable in the beginning lol
Brandon is Me. Like I will Hype up anyone If I’m Friends with them or if they’re having a Bad day.
he drives soo well omg!
IM CONVINCED HES BLITZ IRL
The fact that they censored his ❤ is crazy
One helluva video 😂😂😂😂😂
0:47 Poor Viv, she didn't wanna be involved in this drama
Positive, aggressive, heartfelt.
Brandon rogers is the best singer i ever know.
VIVIENNE IS JS AN AWKWARD MID AGED WOMAN THIS IS SO FUNNY
Congratulations, guys!
One man is the only good thing about helluva boss
1:20 "don't tell me what to do mother f*cker" Was so deadpanned it got me😭🖐
Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel take place far in the future after Brandon and Vivian have left this realm and been re(Hell)born as Blitzø and Charlie. This is proof enough for me. I think that makes them prophets.😮
I love this ❤
This is soooo fricking accurate I LOVE it
0:50 R.I.P. to the scarecrow 😢
Yeah I love that show helluva boss.❤😅
I love how he parked on the place for disabled people, incorrectly too
It’s a lovely show, very degenerate but still very lovely
bro is the meaning of social anxiety 😭
Makes me wonder how Erika Henningsen (Charlie's VA in Hazbin Hotel) would try to honor Viv's hard work, probably with a song. 🎶🎤😄🎶
Dj Blitz is slay i would hire him as my dj
Anyone in 2025
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brandon Rogers: Vivienne Madrano from HELLUVA BOSS!  Hazbin Hotel: Am I a joke to you?!
I’d pay any money for him to do this on my birthday
Jajajaj waht the f-
No one is a bigger fan of Helluva Boss than Brandon
She looked so traumatized
When it comes to her. Everything becomes weird
The what the fuck is going on is perfect
The man being bitched slapped and both of them are way bigger lol
Donna best vitamin
Holy shit is that Brennan Ragers?!
Bro really had to show the naked.. I'm going to go wash my eyes with DAWN DISH SOOOOAAAAAP..
0:28 LMAO!
0:06 WTF 💀
The ending was just so sweet.
You are so cool and funny!
You are the silliest billy and I am all for it.
Social anxiety is scared of him. 💀🤣
This is fucking funny
“That was my voice” goes hard
2:05 " DEMENTIA? I'M *S* *T* *O* *N* *E* *D* MOTHERFUCKER!!! "
Tbh I would do this too if I knew her too
did you actually record yourself naked?
"I just wanna go home" is so real thi
Viv when will there be a session 3&4
0:07 - Oh my gosh! He’s naked!
BRANDON IS LITERALLY HUMAN BLITZØ-
Here we are beep beep   💥💣🚗 VIVIENE MEDRANOO FROM HELLUBA BOSS 👹  there you ARE GET IN THIS CAR OR  I'M RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM !!!!!👹🤬👺  Hello hello viviene everyone 😊
Bro drives like he has nothing to live for
I’m glad Brandon and I drive the same way
This is literally a introvert and a party animal type relationship 😭
😅 that’s Great😊
inspired
This is so in character when he wasn't trying to lol, amazing
1:20  DJ BLITZØ 1:21
Dj Blitzø
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen 👁️👄👁️
Poor viv
Is it terrible that I wanted him to tell her, “Buckle up, Vic!  We’re doing a Shrek!”?
The slaps got me on the ground😂😂😂
I need to know how much of this is fake
wait FUCK the song in the restaurant is similar to hell's greatest dad!???
Oh my god 😂
❤
0:35 I'd like to think this is how he greets all his friends every day regardless of the situation.😂
Hey blitzo I’m just wondering how did you keep the skin fresh? It does get very freaky after a couple hours. Do you mind telling me now it’s for no reason?
Awkwardly social and socially awkward duo fr
1:12 Who’s here to honour the most important girl in this room tonight?!
Hi Brandon :) it’s been a rough little bit thank you for making me laugh
Wait is he the person who voiced blizo?
This video is both hilarious and wholesome. I love it!
THIS GUY
0:35 she looks so confused and uncomfortable 😭🙏
0:31 The voice crack though
I was smiling the whole time while watching this😂
she didn't really seemd like emberest but congrat's and love to Viv and Bryce I mean Brandon
Who thinks helluva boss is better than Hazbin hotel?
Is no one gonna talk about how brandon litearlly almost showed every part of his body?
This is blitzø but human
I swear to god I thought the old lady was Brandon in makeup this whole time
I love fictional characters that are literally just their voice actor 😂
What the fuck are you gonna make a new episode?😊
The Fact Brandon Broke Viv's Mailbox
Not him putting a bucket on her head 😂😂😂😂
BRO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE HE DRINKS.GOOD LORD
😅😅😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉666
What’s the name of the song
I'm convinced Blitz just possesed Brandon long ago.
What the fuck……. 1:54
What the fuck……. 1:54
i started to cry so hard after i watched
"Luckily she's quite durable for an animator" - perfection 🤣
0:07 Blitzo's preferred sleepwear and it just so happens to be Stolas's favorite kind to see on Blitzo.
0:49 its giving Introvert an extravert😭👏
Brandon is so funny
BRANDON, THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL!😂❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
They are polar opposites 😭
0:40 bro went from 👹👺👺👺👺👹👺👺 to 😆😁😄😃🤩😊
Brandon, you’re Just Blitzø aren’t you?
Everyone else: *chill* Brandon/Blitzø: BEEP BEEP GET YOUR FUCKING *inaudible shit*
YAAAY! I like/love Helluva Hazbin. ........ Bath Salts! No wait.... Angel Dust! <3
why is it so funny! 😭😭😭
imagine her just not being in on it
Who tf gave Loona’s human disguise  to Blitz
I don't think she realized what she was getting into when she had Brandon Rogers of all people be the voice of Blitzø 😂
that was so perfect 🤣🥰
or I’m rAMMIng it into yOUR LIVING rOoOoOoOmM
So embarrassing
This dude unironicly is blitz but human. I can't help but feel like some of bltizs personality came from this dude.
🤣 🤣 🤣 BIB-ian MadrOnOe
This is amazing
*w* *h* *a* *t*
Only Brandon can make you feel so loved and so afraid for your physical safety at the same time. He's truly touching.
She's really trying not to laugh 😂
He doesn’t play blizø, blizø plays him
I was pooping while I watched this video. It was wonderful. Best poop I’ve ever 10 out of 10 would recommend
❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I just started watching helluva boss and I alright love it😭😭💗
this is so cute, Viv certainly is a helluva boss for letting her lawn get wrecked by an intern
1:20 did you just dead name your own character
“GET IN THIS FCKING CAR OR IM RAMMING IT INTO UR LIVING ROOMMMMMMM” 😭😭😭
Ok but that song is pretty good
Tell her to bring Adam from hazbin hotel back in season 3 PLEASEEEE
I like how they were all dancing and Vivzie was like “WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING”
I prefer hazbin hotel
Viv at the start was like "wtf"
Geez man! Blitz called, he says you’re at 1000 and he needs you at 100😂
“VIVIAN MEDRANO GET IN THIS **** CAR OR I’M RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM!” I have this distinct, terrible feeling that isn’t the first time someone has said that to her.
2:15 “I just wanna go home” most relatable line
"ima #### cry" NOOOOOO
He even did a video with the puppet versions of them
help i cant breathe
🙂
I was actually there  It was fun the looks on everyone’s faces
Brandon is more chaotic than his actual helluva boss character
Brandon “I’m gonna f*cking cry” Me “WELL GOOD JOB, NOW I AM F*CKING CRYING!!!”
I didn’t know this was 11 months ago
The way that he harassed viv but still emded up being a better person then so many people just shows that brandon is better then all of us.
HERE ON UR B-DAY SO HAPPY B-DAY!!!!!
Brandon can be the most loud person on Earth and I will still love him, Him voicing Katie and Blitz even staying in character makes me want to leave my country and meet him irl 😭
try to find a har on the balls fan, ask them if they are one, then surprising them as blitz i first watched hair on the balls today!!
This was hilarious and wholesome at the same time 😭
One thing I like between Blitz & Brandon is that they are the most savage people I have ever seen.
Autism
Wow this actually had a wholesome ending.
THIS VID MADE ME SO HAPPY AND CRY👍
Poor Vivian
yasss! VIVIENNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Is that Blitz’s human form?
girl done said side eye
2:09 them slaps were personal💀🔥✋
The best 2:40 of my life
Bro was giving so much “I AM Blitzo!”
😂😂😂😂
I LOVE HOW F*CKING CHAOTIC THIS MAN IS!💯🤭😩
My neighbors could probably hear how hard I was laughing at the start of the video. 😂
Wonder if he actually had to film himself naked for that one bit
It's 1:15 am rn and I'm laughing..
I loved this😂
Yessss helluva boss😍😍😍
The stranger watching this happen: 😮😬😑😐🙃
Omg i knew you sounded like blitzo
Bro the way he got ######
0:36 I SPED UP THIS PART AND IT WAS TO FUNNY HELP
the “i’m gonna f-cking cry” was so adorable
Thanks vivziepop for hazbin hotel and helluva boss thanks for evryone
I cant tell if this was a skit, or if Brandon really sprung it on her out of no where. Either way its on brand
This man running away with the award in his underwear. I love him so much
This is Blitzø
Public humiliation is afraid of Brandon 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:30  me fr
Poor viz😭
me picking up my love and/or friends
0:07 in some way i can relate to this
Blitz and stolas. Are. Ment to be lovers not enemies FIX IT 😡🤬😡🤬
This Video gave Blitzø Hair
She looked awfully concerned😂😂❤
Me and my class totally didnt go thru a helluva boss phase where we picked characters (i was fizzaroli)
Cries in Vivzie tears
0:25 "Oop here we are 😁" "🌷☀️beep beep.🙂🪷" "**BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP**" "VIVVIENE MEDRANO FROM HELLUVA BOSS 👺👺🦅" "GET IN THIS **aggressive head shake** F**beep**CKING CAR OR I'M RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOMMM!!!" "🪷🌷hello, hello! 🤗 ✨"
He's actually a blitzo human form and he actually destroy Vivienne medrano's frontyard this is what exactly ai whould generate. But it's not.
I like you more in the show than him freaking out, and I hate this channel Sia
"GET IN THE FUCKING CAR OR I WILL RUN IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM" "hello helloo😊"
She appears horrified
He is so sweet 🥹
This just cured my depression 😭🤚🏼
0:07 well that was unexpected 💀
Ok but this had me dying laughing 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
I bet they made up blitzø’s personality when Brandon drove into the studio through the ceiling
"YAAAAAÆEEEEEEEEE VIVIAN MEDRÆNO FROM HËLLÜVÆ BØSS!"
Give him all around of applause cause I could never, if I would ever do that, I will cry out of embarrassment.
“hellof a boss”
he acts like blito in real life
Yay! I love blitz,I love helluva boss!
Now the song in 1:23 gives ''hell's greatest dad'' vives
wtf is happening😳
😂😂😂😂❤ wtf
0:31 "VIVIAN MEDRANOOWH FROM HELLHLUBAH BOZZ THERE YU ARHH GET IN THIS *car honking momento*  CAR OR IM RAMMING IT INTO YOR LIVING ROOOAEAEANEMAMMSMAMMAMSE" -dumbledoor said calmly
I laugh so hard every single bloody time I watch this video
IDK if Vivienne was part of this whole thing or not but either way it must have been really hard not to laugh.
I’ve never seen Brandon so calm… the end..
If y'all ever go on tour you should come to Tulsa big fan ❤
Blitz this is why I love you
I really hope this was staged
Life like hell  hell like life😔
this whole video is just blitz(o) disguised as his voice actor
Why does the scream not staged but staged?!?!
1:40 its literally hells greatest dad.

1:15 that lady's face omg im dying
Brandon Rogers is the Paul Lynde of this generation!
THE POOR SCARECROW😭😭😭😭
1:33 “What the f(bleep) is happening?! 😠”
She looks so uncomfortable 😂
Let’s ignore that he *is* the actor for helluva boss
Brannon Rogers is literally me if I let my intrusive thoughts win
When the Blitzø came on I lost ut
the unhingedness...LUV IT!
0:28 I guess he learnt driving from Blitz 😂 love them so fvcking much!
this guy has no public shame
I love how Brandon accurately drives like Blitzø and doesn't give a F about it😂
WAS THAT SCRIPT?!
SHE LOOK SO SCARED
“I just wanna go home.”  Real girl, real.
That was sweet
Vivzie reg regrets casting him
The fact that the flash mob is the characters from class act is such a cool detail
Dude is so aggressive to her god. Dude broke out a song. I can’t wait to watch HB
Wait so Vivienne is vizipop??
His driving skills are off the charts
Blitz's acting was so good I almost thought it was Brandon
the second hand embarrassment 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why the fuck am I seeing this just now?😂😂
0:03 "HOHO YEAHHH I AM SO F_CKING EXCITED RIGHT NOW"
I expected him to have bigger ears
R.I.P scarecrow
This feels so much like an episode of The Office
brandon chill out
The deranged energy is giving me life.
Not the fucking neighbor just watching like:🧍
he's not just Blitzø's VA, he IS Blitzø in real life
Brandom would be a perfect character for the office fr
i felt the embrasstment..
brandon doesn’t fear embarrassment embarrassment fears him
This feels to be an act. BUT feels soo real.
1:55 is fucking hilarious favorite part   (Its so cute how she puts up with you)
I wonder how her neighbors felt after witnessing an extrovert kidnap an introvert...
0:07 Brandon I love you man.. but why 😭😭😭
HELP 😭🙏
😂😂😂 what are you doing?
0:06 💀💀💀💀💀💀
"...i just wanna go home.."  Famous words from vivziepop
2:35 the “I’m gonna f***ing cry” made me wanna f***ing cry
OMG I love this😂
1:41 This somewhat needs to be animated
Tell vivianne i lov her work
Woow go Viv and Brandon is awesome as always
This new blitzo episode is amazing
I called it I called it I called it This looks and sounds like butts It looks like the actor but it sounds like  Blitzo
this just needed verbalase to round out the video
YAY THANK YOU VIVIAN!!!! Thanks for sharing your art and passion with the world
Wins what?
😃👍👍  🏆 🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳
¶§¿
Good lord!😂 I’m dying!
Pov: her neighbors:🤨🤨🤨 911?
Brandon rogers in this video is pee wee herman on crack
I LOVE VIV AND BRANDON!! THEIR BOTH SO TALENTED AHH❤❤
Does anyone know where Vivienne House is right now?😂
This gives so much boggo vibes lmao
Vivian Madrona from helluva boss there you are get in this fucking car, or I'm ramming it into your living room *Has a seizure in the car*😂😂😂
I thought that was blits is. Voice.
Brandon is living blizø and you cant convince me otherwise
HELLUVA BOOOSSSS
What kills me is the fact that he just destroys the fence and mailbox to park 🤣
Such a sweet moment, and it only cost about a few thousand dollars in property damage and several driving violations 😀👍
Ok. This is the first time I see a video on your channel so I was asuming I´d get to know you a bit more.  Seeing 49.99% of your naked body was a bit more knowing than I expected.
AWWWWWWWW Vivzie, Brandon!! Oh my god I’m going to fucking cry because this is so sweet!! And hilarious I’m literally rolling on the floor from laughing sir hard seriously tears of joy and from laughter!! What a great show great cast and oh my god but the best fucking director ever!! ❤️❤️❤️ anyway anyone waiting for the new ep this month?!?! 👇👇👇
I can't tell if Viv had actually seen the award before, or if this was the first time and she was genuinely surprised by this, but irregardless that was so ridiculously hillarious and I loved it.
The fact that Brandon Rogers is basically just Blitz in real life just makes this totally hilarious in my opinion. It's like he is basically blitz's human disguise but in a more live action kind of way.
Bro 0:26 ☠️☠️
Vivienne looks genuinely scared lol  Like ik it’s acting but Brandon is terrifyingly funny
0:40 😂 I can’t💀
Funky beat indeed
0:34 *Bipolarity*
blitz human disguise goes so hard
"dementia? I'm stone motherfvcker😡"
0:36 LMAO
Dios mío!! De verdad que si Blitzø fuera una persona, definitivamente sería ÉSTA persona La elección perfecta 🎉 Chef kiss 👌🏽✨
1:49 she almost exploded laughing i can tell
Mans has no social anxiety
... his poor editor
Vivian be medRÃĄno from helluva boss!
Bruv is the second Borat
Sometimes I feel like this is not scripted and all of this real.
the ending was legitimately so sweet
0:35 the guy was so confused....           🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
helluva boss is life
:)
I died laughing and the slapping part killed me
I love all of you guys so much, Helluva Boss is absolutely awesome, please keep being the way you are, you really are amazing sweeties
My favorite creator vivziepop
Brandon having the confidence to put his naked self into a youtube video is so real
I love that he keeps saying "Vivienne Medrano from Helluva Boss" 😂😂
Love how Brandon is just slightly less unhinged than the serial killer he plays
LMAOO “Vivienne Medrano FROM Helluva Boss” Bro said she’s from there- help 😭 💀
Im stoned mf 💀😂
I love this
I just realized two days ago Helluva boss is pronounced Hell of a boss 😭😭😭🖐️💀
They Dox’d @Vivziepop
Very blitzø of him. Ngl
Blitz in real life:
Okay i swear to god if blitzø could have a human disguise it would look exactly like brandon 😂
Sml
If I has Viv I would have died
In all seriousness vivzzy pop is actually the best  I love this show...    ({ 👹 “'“ **B U T THE L A S T EPISODE W I L L BE T H E DEATH O F ME** ”'” 👹 })
NAH THAT GUYS ABSOLUTE SIDE EYE 💀 2:00
HELLUFA BOSSSS
I LOVE THIS ❤❤❤
THE THING OF HIM GETTING OUT OF BED💀💀
the ending is so cute
vivian looks TRAUMATIZED
Helluva Boss Marathon SEASON 1 NEXT Thursday @ 8:00pm - 12:00am e/p Only On Cartoon Television
2:09 when she slapped you 😂
✝️✝️✝️
That poor scarecrow…
My new fav ship
Hopefully the neighbor didnt call the cops
Moxie: sir what the fuck
I can't describe in words how funny this is
She looked genuinely scared for her life getting in that car 😭
Kinda scared me ngl when he crashed into her lawn
I knew I recognised that voice!!!
So the more I look at Brandon's vids the more I think that they just animate Blitz by letting Brandon loose 😭
Wait .. she created helluva boss AND Hasbin Hotel? Wow !
running over viviene's yard be like 👍
Brandon isn’t acting as blitzø   blitzø is acting as Brandon
Viv hey blits you destroyed my lawn  Blits shut the fuk up
People who new him before helluva boss 👇
Viv looks so adorable in this video
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
OR I'M RAMING IT IN UR LIVING ROOM!!😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬💣💣💣💣💣💣😄😄😃😃😃😃😀😀😀😀
"Buckle up"  atleast hes fond of his driving skills
She looked so confused 😂
Brandon voice acts as blitzø ❌️  Blitzø was animated as regular brandon rogers  ✅️
He just has no right of doing anything embarrassing in public 😂
Why is he literally the human version of Blitz
I swear Brandon doesn't play Blitzø. HE LIVES THAT ROLE 😂😂😂 I mean he's just the same chaotic 😂😂😂
Hey Brandon I think something wrong with my phone but trophy’s covered you up 😢
This was a great tutorial for kidnapping
0:31 VIVIENNE MEDRANO FROM HELLOF A BOSS! THERE YOU ARE! GET IN THIS F***ING CAR, OR I'M RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING RoOoOoOoM!!!!!!!!
i see why he was picked to voice blitz lol
I fucking love this man
Oop- here we are, beep beep 😄  *destroys vivs front yard*
Brandon is being Blitz fr.
brandon rogers is literally the human version of blitzø and its amazing
No one else in my family liked helluva boss 😭😭😭
Now its no longer "Viviene Mendrano from Helluva Boss" but "Viviene Mendrano of Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel" she is goals!! 🥹
Poor viv
0:38 This is My Favorite part ‘’OR IM RAMMING INTO YOUR LIVING RAAAM’’
Viv definitely didn’t expect this. "Goddamn it, Polly!" "Oh weell". Damn, I've never laughed so hard before 🤣🔥
I KNEW IT!
guys, this guy does a good blitz impression
Wait, why do you sound like blitz? I swear to God you sound like blitz.
😂😂
Blitzo, go back to Hell, even if your human costume is wonderful, STOLAS IS WAITING FOR YOU
She looked so scared in the video
... this is the weirdest shit.
Alternative title: Brandon Rogers Brandon Roging
2:13 “I just wanna go home”
Blitzø puppet: what is happening why is there a copy of me?
this was uplodead on my birthday of the past year
2:14 “Vivziepop i just wanna go home🥲🥲🥲🥲”
Brandon is the example of “I’m rich and don’t give a fuck”
I love Paulette!!!
Only wish Georgina could’ve shown up
0:06
0:05
This is great 😂❤
aatching this while i SHIT
You can see how Viv is having a great time. Brandon is so considerate :3
HELP IM DYING BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGAGZVDJDJHEWGGAHAHSHSWHWHEHEHEHSHSHSHSHSUWIWIIWUWUWUWUSHSHS
This feels like an actual helluva boss episode
You made biltzø so much better
Brandon needs to make music, his singing voice actually sounds really cool lol
she looks so disapointed🤣
Blitzø  is the best character in all history
Is no one gonna talk about he's naked in 0:07
Your a wonderful human i cant stop blinking on you
"Dementia? I'M STONED MOTHERFUCKER!" absolutely sent me 😂
Brandon is so crazyyyyyyyy
'you made smth we won't forget on this little thing called the internet!' ahh yes. The problematic history of Vivienne Medrano
HOW DOES SOMEONE DO THIS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE 😭
I can’t understand whether this is staged or not
Honestly, I expected nothing less when I clicked on this video lmfao
Blitzø is my 3rd favourite character in helluva boss
It’s giving dundies
Her face screams “get tf away from me”
1:49 SHE LOOKS SO UNCOMFORTABLE HERE OMFGGHSHEHEJRHHRJR
This man is fucking insane
Helluva Boss wins always
I'm really hoping this is scripted. Else the second hand embarrassment is extreme  Edit: I'm pretty sure it's scripted 🤣
was this scripted? this is fucking hilarious
hell yeah drugs😎
The look of concern on Vivs face has me cackling. I love Brandon sm istg-
Someone please make a animation of this!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If I ever had a narrator for my life, I'd want it to be Brandon 😂
seriously u r a master of the arts (mostly comedy)
I'm convinced brandon is the personification of chaos
Viv was like who did i hire for my character??
0:07
Wth 0:06
When the fucking full moon coming out?
Here you can see the calmest and sanest person in the whole world
THE ‘enter text’ HELP
Congratulations to both of you,all people who worked on this show deserve to has all the fans this show have and I love all episodes❤❤❤
blitz, the dj, and brandon Roger dance 💃 moving are great 👍 😊❤😂
i started singing hell's greatest dad
Can you please tell her that she makes the most funny shows ever ❤
I actually think that this guy is living in gta7. Bro just drove into a fence
I feel so bad for Viv.
HOLY JESUS, I SAW THIS IN THE STREAMY AWARDS STREAM BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHAT IT IS.
She looks tramuatized
0:14 _HELLUVA BOOOSSSS_
Brandon will you date the guy how voice stolas???? 😊😊😊😈😈😈
Its intresting coming back to this and realizing the dj song kinda sounds like and early version of hells greatest dad
Are we just gonna ignore that Brandon forgot the O was silent?
It's not Brandon who does the blitzo, it's the blitzo who does Brandon
This reminds me of the office
The thumbnail: Blitzø as Henry Stickmin
These two are the definition of platonic soulmates. love this friendship 😊
SLAYYYYYYY
This made realised that we haven't heard Blitzø singing yet on Helluva Boss
1:25 that was my voice Casually breaking the sound physics: I can see that
I like brandons peewee cosplay lol
"Quite durable for an animator"
Free
fun, I loved this video, when will stolitz be a thing?!?!
Bro had too much coffee
Buckle up Vic we’re DOING A SHREK.
I wished you goth daughter is in this video too LOL
How is this man still in jail
Watching this drunk was a trip
Blitzø be careful humans are fragile you can't just stick a bucket on their head and shove them around like Moxie.
Alavrg
I love Brandon Rogers so much! He's so funny! 😂
It is so upsetting how talented Brandon Rogers is
Good job nice video
imagine how funny it would be if blitz gets a human disguise and then its just brandon. not even animated just brandon on a green screen, walking around.
I feel like this video explains why Blitzo hasn't had any songs yet...
Brandon gives no shits
Brandon is also just blitzø irl and I love it✋🏼😂🖤
i thought he was just a really good impressionist
Poor viv 😭
This is… the greatest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. WHY HAVEN’T I SEEN THIS SOONER!?
0:38
0:38
The fact I could NOT stop cackling 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*IM STONED MOTHERFUCKER*
Bro is so friendly irl but a frickin demon in helluva boss
I thought he actually came to a place to eat and yelled at the top of his lungs
im stoned motherf###!  got me 💀
half a year later (holy shit already??) and this is STILL the most adorable and hilarious video everr😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
The secondhand embarrassment was eating away at my soul
“DEMENTIA? IM STONED MOTHER F$&@&ER”
Aaahahahhaha wanna watch this sooner than i did :/
We all know you're really angry Brandon, we can see it.
You’re so funny it should be illegal 😂
This man needs to lay off the pumpkin spice latte
Brandon rogers is so funny 😂
IFITWAS A MEME IT WOULD HAVE ENDED
brandon rogers is so extra and i'm here for it 😭
“ dementia ? I’m stoned mother fucker! “ - Gramby
1:12, I feel like some people in the restaurant aren't actually acting and just tryjng to eat!😆😆😆
1:49 I can see how hard Vivian is trying not to laugh at this.😂
Oh shit that was Hell's Greatest Dad. Like, the song. You get it.
The fact he voices that one character in hulluva boss (sorry i dont know his name ive never seen it) and katie kill joy in hazbin hotel is amazing
Congrats!!!
Real
0:58 I appreciate that the picture has enough bleedthrough that we can see the stunning Blitz portrait through the paper
0:21 That was unexpected
Is this the Blitzø song we were promised? 😂
I started watching Brandon over a decade ago. Helluva boss started while I was stuck in the troubled teen industry, so when I came out and discovered helluva boss, I didn’t initially realize it was Brandon. When I finally put two and two together: That cliche line about ‘this band saved my LIFE’? That’s Brandon’s (and vivzie’s) comedy (and animation) for me. Ya’ll changed my life and I’m forever grateful.
Man i wish i was in these videos
He's literally the same thing as what he voices
How this man hasn't passed 10 mil is beyond me.
Brandon and Blitz are one in the same.
I hope to one day Meet Brandon  i know i would love his dark humor 😂
Please give 8 th episode
How tf is he not embarrassed 😭
You make the best character voices
it sound like hell of a boss funny
I can't tell if Brandon is a less insane Blitz, or Blitz is a more insane Brandon
Vivziepop sucks.
BRANDON IS SO SILLY WTF DUDE HES CRAZY- Also Vivzie didnt deserve the whole random dance thing embarrassment XD
Hell of a boss
Brandon currently has 6.66 subs
im stoned mf lmao
I fucking love Vivian and I love her too shows they’re awesome.Also, my favorite show is helluva boss and I love Brandon y’all are all awesome and your shows are great Vivian😈 Ps fizzoralli is the best character
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
bro stays in character even when he's not in character
i know
Now make Brendon Ragers a character in season 3
Damn
The track reminds me alot of "Hells greatest dad"
I wish that we saw the neighbors reaction
Someone takes my iPad:  Me: 0:28  Me waiting for my bff so we can get dinner  0:35  Me when life hits me with a car: 0:50  Someone pissing me off: 2:07  Me at school: 2:14
And i just cant believe you voice blitzø
I love helluva boss so much and i love you the 2 together is amazing to my little autistic brain
Did helluva boss actually win an award or is Brandon just being goofy and cute about the show
Are you you insane
I hope more of your rogues gallery show up it was cool seeing Georgina in it
the ending was so sweet
LMAO you're so chaotic 24/7 I love it! I've been watching you (your channel) for four years and it's been amazing every moment!
Holy shit this whole thing was a Rollercoaster ride
i love Brandon
Is that Kronos from Magic Funhouse?
Rip for the scarecrow
I choose to believe he dropped this on her with no forward notice
gosh im so sorry for the comparison but he reminds me of jimmy urine
Is no one gonna talk about the beginning with the dingaling
WE NEED MORE HELLUVA BOSS WHATS HAPPENED TO IT
Pro why
that guy looks just like brennan ragers
Bro dosent give a shi what he does to viv
I wanna believe that Viv had like barely an idea of what Brandon was pulling
Brandon Rogers if he was written by vivsiepop:
Big Blitzø and Loona vibes ❤❤
The scary part is that I can't tell how much is real or not
This is actually fucking insane
God I hope Blitzøs human disguise looks like Blitz or that there’s some reference to his content or him that’d be hilarious
People think Blitzø is just an exaggerated character, they’ve never seen Brandon’s old content
You 2 must be pretty good friends for her to allow you to scream at her and crash into her front garden, even if it is just for a video
jit has demons
0:34-0:50 Bro Vivienne looks like she wanna say "bro I just woke up and got ready I didn't expect this💀"
Right
I can imagine Viv calling Brandon, calling him over, telling him the situation of the episode and just saying "Go crazy, MF". No script and no personality change
if brandon isn’t blitz in human disguise idk who is
imagine if there's just a kid at that restaurant place thing just watching him
That real moment at the end where Brandon broke character 🥺🤧. I love him and Helluva boss so much I'm so sorry I'm late to the party!!! 🎉😢
Brandon regers is the best
MOOOOOOORRRRRRREEEEEEEEEE HELLUVA BOSS VIDEOS!!!!!!!
HOLY SHIT!!!
Love this show and Hazbin hotel so much
Brandon is like if the Joker didn’t have homicidal tendencies and just did random shit like this instead 💀
Im happy that vivi got her show hazbin hotel finally going after years of dedication and commitment. I hope to see helluva boss grow just as much cuz i enjoy hearing kravitz and brandon banter
So Brandon basically just writes his own character, huh?
Blitzo harassing Vivian for 2 minutes and 40 seconds
She looks so scared lol
This is honestly, one of the greatest things Ive ever seen. Why did the ending feel real and emotional?😂
I CANT WAIT TO SEE PAULETTES CHARECTER IN HELLAVA BOSS!!!!!!!!!
OMG this wins the internet lmaoo
Brandon is just american Borat on copius amounts of drugs.
Bro slapped an actual grandma
I'm surprised blitzø didn't correct him about the silent o
"heh, that was my voice"
0:27 HELP IM CRYING LAUGHING OHMYGOD
Wait wait wait, YOU are the voice actor of blitzo?
Hell's greatest dad sing along
. 😂
I wonder if this was all planned and scripted or if it was all improvised
I’m pretty sure Brandon is secretly an ancient chaos god and blitz is his true form
And now she probs gonna win something for hazbin. Damn the hellverse is amazing.
There's a good chance this wasn't a bit
Why is it too small😢
i wanna know if this was in public or not
This is an accurate depiction of an extrovert kidnapping an introvert.
🥲 that was awesome
1:07 bro i have that same trash can 😭
Im watching "Nerd on a Budget" right now and the comments are for a helluva boss thing. 💀😭
Gee, viv sure must be one Helluva Boss™!
Dementia? IM STONE MOTHER FUCKER
RIP Vivienne's fence and scarecrow- T-T
I loved Vivs "I just wanna go home"
Also, i love the Peewee Herman costume
Brandon has got to be the most unhinged voice actor ever and I love it
IM CEYING THIS IS SO FUNNY
What even is Brandon Rogers
Why does brandon give me Will Wood vibes??
The song that Brandon sings to Viv sounds like it’s a similar tune to “Hell’s Great Dad” from Hazbin Hotel
I’m late but congrats to both of you ❤❤
Wheres the google maps guy, he can easliy tell vivziepops location with the pattern of bumps on vivs house
Me crining lol
2:13 wasn’t he just trying to to get brandon?
1:23 meme format
0:39 😂 her neighbor
0:11 👏👏
your comedy is top notch honestly
Straight up turned into an episode from the office at 1:35. 😂
Viv looks like she was regretting her life choices
Brandon was the perfect person to play blitzø
Do you a fnaf hack of a popular webseries
This video makes me wonder if Vivian has ever seen Brandon's content before she hired him as a VA
The reflection of them continually slapping each other at 2:14 was a hilarious editing choice 😂
the restaruant part at the end was scripted but the beggining though no way a neighbor didnt look outside just to see brandon run over her fence
This made me laugh more than it should have😂😂 also congrats for winning
Wtf
Im dying 😂 not literally but still the jokes in this are wonderful and this team together is one of the best things to come to the youtube space
Congrats on getting the part of Katy killjoy
This is giving me the dundy awards from the office😂
Wait, so Blitzo does have a human form for disguise?
Wtf
What
That slap was personal 💀
I can’t believe you got to voice Katie killjoy
Oh my god we have Vivziepop here, like _"Omg please stop..."_ She's going through a Brandon Rogers video, I don't think the Craziniess of Blitzø's voice actor will end...
Sometimes there are very special stand out just perfect people to play a role. Rdjs Iron man, Ryan Reynolds Deadpool, and Brandon playing Blitzo is just one of those perfect casting moments
Bro Brandon is f***in hilarious
This was oddly wholesome
IM CRYING OMG- GODDDDD I LOVE THIS MAN
ok but i dont think anyone knows how much i love this motherfucking show
Aw cute
They look so uncomfortable
Brandon: *cutely runs over a bunch of stuff*
First sickness of this video is a flashbang this is a warning but apparently to get flash bangs God dam
Poor vivzie pop😭😭
If blitz was ever a person
Man you're so lucky that you get to be in the show on YouTube while I'm over here doing dishes for my little sister and my mom lol 😂
O Bradon peladu no inicio kkk
Im concerned for Viv's sanity after this.
oh wait this is the guy that voiced blitz
Wait.. HES BLITZ FROM HELLUVA BOSS?! I KNOW HIS VOICE SOUNDED FAMILIAR BUT I DIDN’T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY HIM!?!?
pft- me getting my bff for plans💀:
This is so Wholesome
This dude is fucking hilarious 😂
0:22 I'm Tyrone!
If Jim Carrey and Andy Samberg had a son
Viv from hell of a boss (your text here) my text to put there whould be "a goddess"
No wonder he voice acted Blitz. He is BLITZ.
Vivienne went crazy😶😶
Me just vibing to the song
I feel bad for everyone who saw him ram in the fence
I Love this Video xD
VIVZY LOOKED SO CONFUSED
Dear Vivian  So… Did he replace your fence or did he use a fake fence that he already had in order to do that stunt with the car?
Poor girl she frightened..!     … what y’all thought I was talking about her… No…. The car 😢
This is my favourite show ngl
Bro literally acts like blitzo 😂
The way he destroyed anything and everything in sight
0:49  Pov Mrs Mayberry in the first episode of Helluva Boss
nodoby is talking abt the beginning 💀💀💀💀
2:09 did I just hear a moan?!
This was the best thing in the streamys aside from matpat doing his best
i loved the slapping part
it’s funny bc she has no idea what’s going on
Congrats, Viv!
1:31. Hit it brandon 😂
Brandon, did you really have to dress up like Pee Wee Herman?
❤😊
Me whenever I see an npc’s front yard in Grand Theft Auto V: 0:28
Brandon CREATED social anxiety
“Dementia, IM STONED MOTHER FUCKER”
1:35 i like how viv in this is actually wtf is this guy doing
How come I haven’t seen blitzo in your award uniform wearing that streamline like a strap on and flaunting it around Peter Griffen
I need to see this animated
I would have been so embarrassed
This makes me style, I love Brandon’s dedication and how much fun it looks like he has. Also his lil dance 😂
Each and every one of you is a fucking legend
Brandon being Brandon  Vivienne: Why did I ever hire you...
It feels so weird after that i realised, that every time i see Brandon, i'm hearing Brandon. When i see Blitz, I'm hearing the Blitz
This funny
The way he ran into the fence🤣🤣
"How much are they paying the voice actors of helluva boss......"  Brandon: " I'm a freaky ass creep for free! *hysterical laughter*"
The man in the back was a Paid actor-
Yea Brandon is definitely not unhinged in the slightest
I can't believe Brandon actually doing this 2 times
You look more like moxie
I KNEW HE PLAYED THAT CHARACTER
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that he broke her mailbox and fence 😭
I have no idea what just happened
He seems like a really nice guy Tweaking
omg, shes literally just me whenever the servers come out singing and all that for my birthday or whatever at resturants
More vivienne kidnaps
1:27 What Song?
❤Mortal Combat: Brandon Rodgers wins,!!! 🎉
1:28 - Yo, this is one catchy beat!
I honestly Blitzo’s voice seems to remind me of Mike Wazowski from Monsters Incorporated.
She seems like a tired mother lmao
Him just crashing in to viviennes fence and mailbox is just perfect
Thank you
"Dementia!..I'm stoned motherf***er!!"😂😂
Kill me
the O is silent, Brandon.
This gives me Michael Scott vibes and I love it
1:22 Me when somebody tells me what to do.
The fact he kinda destroyed viv’s yard is hilarious
I only recently discovered this dude. Wtf? I still haven’t figured out what I’ve been watching, and I’m like two hours into it.
0:36
She is quite durable for an animator😂
Vivian and I have the same choker 🙏🏾🥹🖤
Shodi na raboty daun
😂 i luv this.
Hopefully when I’m older I can work with Viv and you cuz of how amazing you guys are
I Look at Halluva Boss am i love it ❤❤
OR IM RAMMING IT IN UR LIVING ROOaOaoOaOaoOoOaoOaoOaoOoaoOaoOM!
I'm so glad Brandon is apart of Helluva Boss
Pov:Blitzø when he was alive (aka as human)
Will Brandon get sued for property damedge
There’s no way my man actually rammed through her fence 😂
i would've fire him on the spot lol
not Brandon drank 100 cups of coffe
this is amazing
Brandon is great when it comes to comedy 😂😂
Hell of a boss is wayyyy better then husband hotel
I can't tell if Brandon is Blitzo or Blitzo is Brandon.
Brandon's acting and writing somehow makes everyone seem more animated by proxy alongside him.
HELP LOL
helluva boss~
I Didnt Know The Same Guy Who Played Blitzo Also Played the Angry Mother
Am I now realizing he’s is the voice actor
Bro you drive about as good as your character 💀
He not wearing clothes in the bed  But wear the clothes in shower  What
anyone question when he yells he sounds like deadmeat? no? jjust me?
Donna in the background cheating on grandpa
I just realised helluva boss is a play on hell of a boss
Blitzø finally got his song xD
*Blitzø meeting his actual mom is just amazing*
r u mentally ok
Isn't the song from Lackadaisy
anyone knows what song is this??
Why is no one talking about the fact he completely ran over Viv’s front yard 😂
You know,  I've seen the comments stating that Brandon Rogers is just Bitzo's human persona. I get it now.
1:45 help this was amazing
When Brandon started dancing he was literally hitting the griddy 💯💀
I’m not sure they won the award because I think BFDI actually beat them out which is kind of shocking when you think about it but understandable not to offend anyone I like both shows
Okay but why does he act exactly like his character 😭
Why did he put blush on
Right on! Keep up the great work, you glorious homo sapiens!!
Somehow the voice actor is an even stranger character then the character
So terribly cringe but I love it
I rlly wonder what this dude would be like irl
0:50 Rip that thing
what is happeing is this what it feels like to be high
He acts like blitzo so much omffgg
I need Viv's heart sweater
Imagine seeing someone crash into your neighbor’s fence and scream “VIVIENNE MEDRANO FROM HELLUVA BOSS”
she does a great job at animating helluva boss makes me smile so much ( she did a great job at blitzo)
I don't know how viv wasn't laughing her ass off. I would not have survived without laughing
Honestly wish I could be like this
They better not replace you for a different  voice actor you're literally the voice for him
Vizze blink twice if you need help
I like that the old lady said to Brandon “I’m stoned motherf@$&er”
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂my stomach 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OH MY GOSH I DIDN'T KNOW BRANDON ROGER'S WAS BLITZ NO WONDER  HIS VOICE WAS FAMILIAR
wtf lmao
Fortnite moves
I love Helluva Boss!
he is so good at driving
Ok this is hilarious and so wholesome at the same time but I think the real question is did Vivian really know that Brandon was coming or did he actually run over her mailbox and she had no idea any of this was going down?
Just the random people that saw him crash into the mailbox must’ve been like WTF is going on
Blitzø is literally brandon rogers playing brandon rogers.
brandon what the fuck is the thumbnail
Imagine how he'll react if helluva boss was nominated for the annie awards, let alone win one
did vivienne create a human made after blitzo
He de actually run into that fence or what that edited, because its either really good editing or he legit crashed a car safely
The random stranger staring  as he yelled 😭
1:15 did u see her?
He has some balls to do this in public.
Egg
People will ship brandon rogers and Viviane medrano after that😂😂😂😂
0:39 ain’t no way he just rammed her mailbox and embarrassed himself in public
bro thnk how upset she is😂😂
when he crashed in the (fanes)?
This is the cutest, most on brand thing Brandon could have done <3
Brandon Rodger’s would be the perfect actor on what would you do 💀
That "gOD *DAMN IT* PAULETTE" was so unnaturally passionate, he's truly a good actor
R.I.P. Vivian’s front yard
Hell yeah 😂 the show they made together is my absolute favorite and I hope they keep it going for a while!!!😂❤❤
"MOVE WE GOT VIVIENNE FROM HELL OF A BOSS"
Can’t tell if this is real or staged
"Dimentia?!? I'm stoned motherfucker!" *Slaps Brandon*
I can’t see the difference bettween Blitzø and Brandon 😇😇😇
the directors said cut, but they heard cunt
At first i didn't believe him but then i searched on google and then i saw it and i nearly cried for some reason I love brandon so much and i LOVE HELLUVA BOSS!!!
I love Vivian she's so socially awkward
❤❤❤ AWWW
We love helluva boss for life
0:49 And now, a scarecrow dying from an insane man’s car
Blitz just keeps gettin' better.
Very wholesome moment. Congrats to everyone involved, it's a great series. Don't know why Brandon is dressed in like Michael Jackson from the Billie Jean music video, but hey...it's something.
He blurred the emblem of his car but forgot the steering wheel
BROOOO HE PLAYS BLITZO FROM HELLUVABOSS.. I NEVER KNEW THAT THAT'S SO COOL
1:27 Music?
The ending is so wholesome ❤
"hellof a boss?" shame on you
"Dementia? I'm stoned motherfucker" under-rated lins of the millennia.
0:35 “GET IN THIS —beep— CAR, OR I’M RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROA👹OO👺AO👹M‼️” the next second: “Hello helloo! 🫶🏼😚😌😊☺️🌸”
nah idk what this guy did before he became blitzo but he embodies him
Brandon literally acts like blitzø
He doesnt just voice him he IS him ‼️‼️
Viv be like: what the hell did i get myself into
As a kid who’s a helluva boss fan                         This is a masterpiece
Lmao I didn't know he was actually in the show
Brandon probably committed many war crimes in his past
I love his chaotic energy 😂
this guy is so funny  mad jim carrey vibes
Was that Mf MIKE TYSON IN THE BACKGROUND
Social Anxiety is scared of him, Lol.
My anxiety could never💀💀
Lol did is fucking funny😂
My favorite character is blitz so when he’s fighting grandpa plus congratulations the person that created helluva boss I watched every single episode and where is episode seven🤨🤨
I love helluva boss especialy stolas blitzø moxie and millie i think thts how u spell her name bro
Respect for him making a fool of himself.
The song was good tho 😂
Brandon voices Blitzø? Nah he *is* Blitzø.
Love brandon, fucking hate helluva boss it fell off so hard
She looks like she regrets hiring him 😭
ween
This is beautiful
are thoes paid actors? (spontaneously cum-busts)
Viv's reactions felt completely genuine throughout the video
Poor Vivienne she must be confused beyond thinking
The “What the f@$!! is happening?” I felt in my soul I said it with her🤣😭
bro is the character he acts
I love this
wait is brand roger blitz? in helluva boss or am i dumb
Social anxiety : I fear him.
What you blitzo from hellova boss omg
Oh my god give her a break
The fact they actually made a Blitzø puppet is hilarious.
PFFF
1:27
Helluva Bob 😂
Bbg ur gonna get fired
0:27  This fucking scene keeps fucking killing me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Interesting wakes up naked and takes a shower with clothes on
❤
Oh my god, it's Brandon Rogers
He never stops making laugh and cry. ❤❤❤❤
I just realized is Brandon blitzø
all this video says for me is "shits and giggles." And i love it so much lmao
I love fact that he was like "get in f***ing car or IM RAMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM"
The line between blitzo and Brandon is so small I don’t even think he’s acting he’s just doing what he usually does in his videos like they’re one in the same
YOUR BLITZ
Idk why but know I want to see the puppet in the actual show
Poor vivie😭😂
If we ever see human BlitzØ, I hope he'll look like Brandon
0:43 hellof missing a space, bad spelling
Vivian makes great animations. The only thing I hate about her that she started banning ukrainian people for them complaining about her sponsoring a russian guy who supports war. This is unfair.
“DEMENTIA? I’M STONED MOTHERF*CKER!” 2:04
✨I just wonna go home..✨
Poor neibor
Not even 2 minutes in and I'm already dead 💀
i wish my parents didn’t divorce so I could go to my grandparents house and watch this with my uncle
ship😊
Your blitzø omg your very funny
I feel her Right now
Having fun yet ....Em....
I LOVE THIS
Helluva boss is awesome
Brandon and his Toyota 😂
HELLUVA BOSS MY FRIEND LOVES THIS SHOW!! 🖤🖤
Masterpiece.
watching Brandon Rodgers while high is such an otherworldly experience
I wish he would do this to me...
Wow
BRO IF I MET A GUY WHO SOUNDED LIKE THAT I WOULD WANNA BE HIS FRIEND
The best part is I truly believe that Brandon Rogers kidnapped Vivienne Medrano, took her to some random restaurant, and summoned an imp from hell as his DJ all to present her with a made up award in a spell of absolute lunacy.
2:03 “DemEntia.. I’m st0ned Mother Fucker!” WHAACKKK!!! 😂🤣🙌  Favorite part! Caught me off guard and had me break out of my depression 😅
His voice 🤩
This is cute and all but hurry the fuck up with hazbin hotel
THE O IS SILENT
In local reports, strange man causes multiple property destructions.
The beginning has nothing to do with the Streamy, It's just another Tuesday with Brandon as a friend
My favourite part of this video is the Grand Theft Auto V driving
I think 2× speed is just blitzø on crack
I think he might start using guns to shoot big shots
Our man needs q raise tbh
nobody: Me on roblox:
Wait is Brandon actually pamsexual or am i wrong also sorry if im intruding anyones buisness
nahh her lawn
Congratulations you guys you guys deserve it. Brandon You also deserve this to. With all the animations you guys are doing for the new episode of helluva boss I’m proud of you guys I really am I could never do it as good as animations as you guys could
So wholesome
Why does he sound like blitz😂😂
0:26 "oh here we are beep beep"
the fact they added him in an episode so cool!
Blitzs voice actor is just as crazy as him😭
“Hey dj blitzø why don’t you hit that funky beat” “Don’t tell me what to do motherfucker” “Heh that was my voice” “I can see that”
He's crazy. No wonder why he's casted as Blitz
"GET IN THIS FUKING CAR OR IM RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM!" had me dying
2:14 “i just wanna go home 🥲”
hehehe
I could make this video even worse :3
The people who just wanted to eat
At the end he acted normal
I didn’t know he was an actor in Helluva boss
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
he's so random...
Brandon's wild creativity could've made shows like Reno 911 insane.
Are you going to do more with helluva boss
What is this
Complimenti anche qui dall'italia.🇮🇹  Congratulations from Italy too. 🇺🇸
I like the neighbor watching and was probably wondering if he should called the cops
I love helluva boss
2:06 LMFAO
Right as I said wtf, so did Viv, I'm happy about that
🎉 ♥️ Congrats you two! Your both creative, hilarious, and unique! You're gonna go far! 💫
The face of the guy on the left is just hilarius 1:52
The fact he doesn't close the car door when she gets out🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣:*:·\(￣▽￣)/·:*·°★*
Congratulations Viv and Brandon and spindlehorse crew you are one of my favorite creators and Brandon one of my favorite voice actors
bro needs to chill 💀💀💀
Dude I absolutely adore helluva. Boss
This makes me question how much Blitz is written and not improvised.
I play with myself to your videos :)
This was oddly wholesome in a Brandon Rodgers way, congratulations
The slaps i cant XD😂😂😂
How is it that the ultra gore filled cartoon about Gay as Fuck Demons in HELL is Brandon at his most *restraint, composed and sane?* Well I guess cause it's someone else's project he has to behave........  XDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXDXD
❤❤❤
W Brandon
Someone please animate this
Vivian employed Brandon freaking Rogers.  I can feel the second hand embarrassment don't get me wrong, but I mean you gotta know that this is the toll it comes with.
Blitzø suddenly makes a lot more sense
This is so crazy in a point that prooves this guy is blitzo itself
😆
The people in the restaurant: tf is helluva boss
The fact that he literally did this is fucking hilarious
I don’t know how but you’re the first person I’ve ever seen to make social anxiety scared of you
First half of the video: The neighbors honest reaction to Brandon Rodgers picking up Viv:  Second half: Confusing Viv with the dance party  End: wholesome appreciation and reflection
peewee play
I will come back in 10 years with a surprise
i love them man, congrats vivzieee
Misheard him at 0:22 as "a steamy security officer"
My home is ✨Helluva boss✨
YEEEEE
I love how everyone just bitch slaps each other at the 2:10 mark.
bruh ok
I LOVE THIS HAHA
I like how they even got Donna's actor
no way the puppet is cool
This man is deranged
Brandon, just can’t feel embarrassment is just honorable.
I love it. 😂❤
She is so confused and I am living for it!
I love how Brandon went with Blitzø's personality the whole time
He doesn’t play Blitzø, Bliztø plays him
Congrats you more than deserve it 🥳🎉🍾, and he really is blitzo 😂🤣😈❤️🖤🤍🥰
Why i just i Tank That Blitzo i need Charge of Him His neck
The fact he did in it in puplic
The fact I'm in a lecture laughing and some peeps are looking at me
For that small amount of time where he picks up viv he is more like blitzø than blitzø himself
0:29 WHAT THE HELL BRANDON 😂😂😂
i fucking love how bro does this all in character man
This is funny as fuck
The way he crash his car and the neighbor look in shock
"Just stop" your talking to the person who walked in a shop naked
*"one of anxiety worst enemy"*
he's literally me bro
He's like a violent gay Pee-Wee Herman.
Jimmy in payday2:
this is great and all. but wheres hazbin daammmit xd
I KNEW IT
He's not Blitzo's voice actor, HE IS Blitzo!
seems normal to me
Ojala Helluva boss fuera eterno
Se merecen lo mejor del mundo
Vi te amo
Imagínate emocionarte por ser la voz de un personaje de basura boss que oso we 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
True blitzø fation
I love this guys so much ❤
BRANDON 😭
😂 I need someone to animate this.
"Sir this is a mcdonalds" "I DONT GIVE A SHET😃"
This man cant get out of character even when hes not his character
The part when he gets out of bed😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Anxiety fears him😂
nadie si blitzo fuera humano xdd
I never realized this guy was the voice actor for blitzo but it's so dam obvious
He reminds me of Borat with his public skits lmao
“gEt iN tHiS ****iNg cAr oR iM rAmMiNg iT iNtO yOuR liViNg rOoOoOaAaAaAoOm” best part
why is this so funny
“That is the last time I’m letting your dementia get the better of you.”  “Dementia? I’m STONED MOTHERFUCKER” fr I can relate
HELP
This is so funny, yet so wholesome
Everything wasn't scripted.
I love it when actors give their performances 110%, not only do they pretend to be the character, THEY ARE THE CHARACTER
This is the most funniest shit I’ve ever seen in my life 🤣
hi my name is Mason am 12 years old am a fan of the helluva boss show   and can I please be on your show I can voice fizzarolli
I'M DYING-
„Dementia? I’m stoned motherfucker!“ literally hit me harder than Brandon
Ебааааать. Просто топ, пушечно. И если вы не понимаете то мне похуй на вас знайте.  P.S. Я русский Ebaaaaat. Just top, cannon. And if you don't understand, then I don't give a fuck about you, know. P.S. I'm Russian
😂👌
The look of fear in her eyes as she got into that car.... girl same.
I love how he stills bring Brandon even all the years that came by 😂😂😂
Someone's gotta draw the comic version of the DJ Blitzo part if that doesn't already exist, please-
The way he drove into her fence, mailbix AND decoration just to pick her up was hilarious😩
He’s living his best life
Lmfao
What the heck even is this?
Hello blitzo
I like how viv is just chill even tho blitz literally destroyed her fence then kidnapped her then embarrassed her infront of everyone in the restaurant 😂     Edit: but damn Brandon is just the same as blitzo fr
Congratulations 🎉 now if only YouTube actually sent me a notification that the new episode was up that would be nice 👍
He’s so good at driving
Absolutly deserves it! Such creativity and amazing talent behind all of the work! Keep it up!
rip that one scarecrow
social anxiety's worst enemy
I can't believe how good is Blitzo at voice overing this dude, so good he possessed him in 0.1 seconds
so on brand lmao this fandom just gets better and better <3 WELL deserved award
I'm dieing 💀
As funny as this is, Viv deserves it. She truly does. I’ve been watching Helluva Boss since 2021 and the series is just amazing. All of the effort that goes into the show is incredible. And let’s not forget the amazing team. Oh yeah. And to Brandon. You’re amazing for voicing Blitz. Keep it up
Extrovert and their adopted introvert friend
Bro he fits Blitz so well 😂
10/10 video THIS MADE ME GIGGLE
I love how cool your videos are
Brandon the o is silent
He deserved all of this fame 🙏
“hellof a boss”
I love Helluva Boss so much
I love how Viv looks so concerned
So Blitzø is just Brandon without any acting huh?
0:28 ...... *WHY OFC YOU RUN INTO THINGS-*
Such a great show and Brandon is always 100 percent!!
Shame the writing has gone downhill.
0:26 - 0:42 BRO😭😭
Lol
Yep, Brandon is human version of Blitz. And you know I really can't wait for episode where Blitz will finally sing a song.
autism belike: and me personally i am autistic
Brandon existence makes this timeline worth living in
0:27  R.I.P Fence and mailbox
Little did we know this was similar to the recruitment process Vivian had when hiring Brandon to play Blitzo
blud WTH
I hope that’s not here actual house because some people be intensely good at figuring out where people live
0:28 this is my favorite part🤣
Commit to the bit
Just as chaotic as Blitz. I love you.  The "O" may be silent, but it's replaced with the 😯 on everyone's face.
He is just as horrible as his character.
This is amazing XD
The fact that brandon ran over the scarecrow lol
She agreed to this hahahahaha! I love this show a lot and this is better wooooo
Best show ever
“I just want to go home” is. Mood
The more of this guy’s videos I watch the more I realize Blitzo is just this guy but in hell 😂
Is this cannon??
Brandon is like Blitzø and Deadpool meshed into one. Lol
Im very very very very very very very very very obsessed with you and with helluva boss ❤
I don't even know what to say anymore man
Brandon in this sketch reminds me of Slappy the dummy from Goosebumps 😂
Season 2 episode 6 made me almost cried
I like blitz
Is this cannon for helluva boss?
The voice sounds familiar 🤔
They really got the best person to play Blitzø
Wait YOU'RE THE VOICE ACTOR?! HOW DID I NOT PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
This is so perfect. Congratulations 🎉
This was so awesome. The puppet was great.... And i love everything that team does
I love this dude's chaotic energy so much
bro needs a Netflix show 💀
The commitment to the Bit is great.
hellof a boss, my favorite series of all time.
I’ve loved Brandon rodgers for years now and it’s nice to see this
You know, it's moments like these that make me lose faith in humanity.
I really hope this wasn't scripted and she had no idea. lol
Vivan seems so lovely, she is such a skilled artist and animator <3
this has such office vibes
Oh my god its brandon rogers from random brogers
I LOVE THE FACT HES COSPLYAING BLITZ
I love how Random those Is
how did y'all keep straight faces while filming this 😂
I'm loving how vivian puts up with his shit.  I bet it's great to be brandon's friend.
I think it's just Blitz in the human disguise 0:27  I know he is the voice of Blitz
0:49 RIP Scarecrow, you will not be forgotten.
I can very much tell why they hired Brandon to voice Blitzø-
You are the definicion of goofiness
This is too funny 😂
I'm the 1 Million Viewer guys!!!
YAYYYY I LOVE THIS VID
Is this cannon
Really glad you two are working together, you add a lot of flare to her show and it’s wonderful, thank you.
0:36 - 0:40 is the funniest moment in this entire video.
I love this video
He is as crazy as blitzo
Congratulations viv
Drunk Mox is still my favorite.. 🤣🤣🤣
My brain always pronounces it hell-oo-va boss
The actor of blitz destroyed  viziepops fence
fun fact: the voice actor of moxie is actually a voice actor from skylanders lmao
Loooove you guys!!!! Keep it up!!
They broke a small fence and mailbox just for a joke, now that’s courage
Brandon Rogers is an actual human Blitzo
Brandon is literally my favorite person
holy shit. i feel like i watched this 3 months ago  time is weird.
2:09 THAT SLAP THO 💀
the "omg please stop" sounds so real XD
The fact that I'm also a Medrano is Insane
I LOVE HOW THE MAGIC FUNHOUSE  CAST IS HERE
i ship it
Why is he the same like bitzo
O-o
The shit he’s willing to do to promote Helluva Boss is a very Blitz thing to do
2:30 😊😊😊😊
😂
Even two weeks after this video was made, I love to pretend that Brandon paid off that restaurant owner, had the puppeteer behind the bar the whole time, and in other words, this was all real.
Lets appreciate how Brandon acts mostly like blitzø in that moment of facts
The team for this project are all so amazing and congrats to everyone, especially Viv tho! She made it all happen. Congrats guys
I literally love Brandon so much Viv could not have picked a better vc!
😂😂😂
I hope I meet them
the office
This gun ain’t pretend BAHAHHA
why does this give sm what we do in the shadows vibes
Bro was just recreating what he did during the Rewards
why are there no nazis or racists or rapists in helluva boss and just loads and loads of homosexuals wtf
I feel like Brandon has gotten so far with internet content he’s referring to a song called ‘ Welcome to the Internet ‘.
did they utile the music from lackadaisy??? thats awsome!
introverts and extroverts be like:
Whats funny is that Vivienne is not concerned that Brandon ran over her fence and mailboxn & scarecrow
Yes Vivian
This is a level of Confidence and semi lack of self respect that I am in awe with and envious of  The lengths Brandon can and will go to, is inspiring more than cringe, and some of the best indication of how talented he is  He’s got tom green energy, if Tom green had talent.
It took me that long to realize he voices blitzo
The fact that you can tell how much fun Brandon has while playing Blitz is so uncanny yet brilliant.
Wait what did they win a Grammy where can I watch them win
i love this
The voice actor really is the soul of the character he is literaly Blitz irl
Congratulations!!
You sir, are a fucking legend <3
this feels like an unaired office pilot
im flabregasted
The cringe made me laugh
Despite the backlash, the team works hard and delivers ! Good job Helluva Boss !
vivien is my deadname so i went on fight or flight mode whenever he said it T.T
Nah brandons singing voice is magestic i legit cant wait until blitzø sings in the show
Brandon is such a good friend😭🙌💜
Those fucken high kicks, props.
this is fucking hysterical
Why is it so funny to me of Brandon just *ramming* is car *through* Viv's front yard?
What I've learned: Don't get Brandon Rogers on your show, he will destroy your lawn if you win an award
Vivziepop: i wanna go home😢😢😢
Congratulations you guys!!!! I'm so fucking proud of you all!
Nice to know that Blitzø va is a gnarly opossum in real life too
the way he can be like the role he plays is amazing
This fucker is the modern day Jim Carry 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This made me laugh Brandon is hilarious I've seen this on Instagram a while back
Nice job
ThEse 2 officially take place in the universe 1:20
😂😂😂
Congratulaciones! I love your work
"Vivienne medrano from helluva boss" i love that nickname
this is such a brandon and not brandon thing to make
This This THIS!
Wow
Vivienne:I just wanna go home Fizz ep 6:I just wanna go home
so whens hazbin hotel
this feels like the dundies episode of the office where they go to a chilli's
Weres stolas😂
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I well to hell after you said “She’s quite durable for an animator” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh my gosh I didn't know he was the voice actor
VIVIAN GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE OR IM RAM CAR INTO YOUR LIVING ROOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!! *literally 5 seconds later* hi how are you doing 😌😌
Was that Dylan mulvaney?
Equal parts chaotic and wholesome?????
The funniest part is Viv's genuine embarrassment bc there are normies around in the background 1:58 who front row for Brando's performance
He's trying be like sml but I love it a lot of humor
Brandon is a goofy goober. In a good way
Watching anime and reading manga is always so exhilarating..
CALLED HELLUVA BOSS
Vivziepoppy girl!!
Im losing it.
Also hi vivzie ❤👑✨️
Yas Bran is cosplaying his own character this is so cool thx Bran❤✨️👑
Wut da fuck
How am I proud and disappointed to be subscribed?
The fact that Brandon doesn’t change while acting for blitz is perfect
Alot of stuff happened in that two minutes
You make my day better 😂😂
Bruh, wtf XD
Brandon u r everything to me
Bruh Viv fr just went to hell found blitz and brought them back to life to make these helluva boss ep
sound familiar
Brandon is so hecking hilarious
Can everyone agree that helluva boss needs to be acknowledged and added onto Netflix cause honestly its better than half the shit they got
The commitment is truly beautiful!!!! XD
Based
By far the best part of the show
nah bruh ain't no way all the acting he does for Blitzo is being a MILDER version of himself
This confirms that Brandon Rogers and his personas are all just Blitzo's Human Disguises.
I love this😂❤
What is this
🎉😂❤
"FUCK I'VE BEEN WASHING DISHES IN MY SLEEP AGAIN"
Blitz living his musical theatre dreams in Brandon Rogers form
She knew what she was getting into when she got Brandon 😂😂😂
omg！！！blitzo！！
I beg you to do a skit of Hoarders but the hoarder only hoards dildos and sponsor Adam&eve
Please tell me it was scripted when he drove through her house
Who does she voice again?
0:10 damn
That was completely unhinged and I loved every second. Wholesome Blitzo moments
this guy kinda looks like Brennon Ragers
I love this so much and I love the show. It would be so fun to Brandon
FINALLY he made a video about the show haha
Its hilarious how everything done in this video could be in character for blitzo
I made the right decision subscribing to brandon all those years ago lmao
Me when it’s my best friends birthday.
0:38 Character insanity right there "Get in the fuckin car or i am haming it into the eleventh ring" I love this part so much
Hooray!
Love it XD
That slap was PERSONAL
If blitz actually existed
He’s just as annoying as blitzø is 😭
how to get fired 101
this entire video is my new alarm sound thank you brandon i love you
You did to much to get her a trophy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
serious Brandon at the end oh my goddd
Bruh the civic 😭😭🤣🤣
Nah because Brandon is  Blizo, I swear she couldn’t have picked a better voice actor
Oh God! I wish Paulette were in the show!
This is both hilarious and heartwarming in equal levels
The brightened up my day so much
Good lord what a nut
“Im stoned!” 👋 💥
Best video ever!
I'm just imagining blizø saying all of these things and mimicing the actions of Brandon
Pee wee, that you?
SHE CREATED HELLUVA BOSS, SHE IS A LEGEND, SHE IS A GODDESS, SHE IS EVERYTHING THAT IS COOL IN LIFE
Best show
THE O IS SILENT 🔇!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Helluva Boss is seriously one of the most fun shows I've watched in the last 10 years of my life
Imagine eating here and and seeing this shit happen
Ok you made me laugh😂
I wonder how many Brandon Rogers fans have been living under a proverbial rock and hadn’t heard of HelluvaBoss until this video (or have heard of it but never watched or realize he was in it)
Wöw
How he does this without dying from laughter or embarrassment is beyond me. And that honestly makes it funnier.
Vivienne is my name!
1:37 Bro's throwin' it back
HOW DID I NOT REALIZE HES VOICE BLITZO
I can only imagine how terrifying yet hilarious it would be to meet Brandon!
the closest we'll get to blitzo actually singing
We LOVE you all ❤😂🎉
Helluva Boss is the highlight of my entire youtube watching history and I honestly hope at some point you all get to make big money off of it (if that's what you want) because it's honestly a masterpiece. I get so excited when a new episode comes out and it truly makes my day 100% better. Thank you all for all you do to create it.
I loveeeeeeee the show I just wish it would drop once a week instead of every-other month
I wanna know was everyone in on it
Real life helluva boss
Cringe
Jsi
Brandon Rogers gives off mad Peewee Herman on crack energy in this video, and I am here for it!
❤❤❤
this man needs a show on adult swim
i love this show honestly it kind of saved me athis past year has been hell alot of messed up things have happened and honestly i did lose myself for a while i love life and i love waking up and remembering that sometimes my situations arent all that bad, blitzo has helped me kinda think about ho i am and what i need in life and who i atually want to be i messed up when i was younger i let the people i loved et away because of blind obsessions and ive made various misakes its uncanny how hard this hit lmao
Please never die
her poor lawn!!!
Damn she looks like she enjoys arguing on twitter about her shit show LOL
1:01  is this a leak of his human design
This is so unhinged and wholesome at the same time, I love it 😭
Losing my shit over him just tearing into her lawn, makes me wonder if they planned that. It’s funny as hell.
so sweet :') she talked about her team and he posted this to channel lol idk why im just now gettin this, i saw this live xd anyways well deserved, congrats once again
If anyone wants to know who's the best person to invite to your birthday party it's Brandon
Stolas: good job blitzy
Never thought the voice of Blitz would be this crazy in real time...
You traumatized me when I was 6 I loved your content though
same
so fucking cool
Blitz = you eh sane energy
I like how it's pretty much his normal voice
He plays blitz-o ??
ok
I guess this goes to show. No matter how many jerks come up with pathetic controversies to make Viv seem like a horrible person on Twitter and no matter how many idiots who think their critics insult her show. Vivziepop will still come out on top. Because she can work and be patient with someone as crazy as Brandon.
This is amazing
Congratulations you are the new peewee herman
This feels like a Parks and Rec episode
I remember back when all we had was the sneak peaks for hazbin hotel, i love how far we've come.
I just want to say this…you are doing an absolutely STELLAR job as Blitzø! S2E6 really shows your talent in acting! You put so much emotion into your performance and I am just in awe! You’ve done a great job, Brandon! Keep it up! Can’t wait for next episode!
Brandon. Please be blitz's fucking human disguide!! 😭
I LOVE THIS MAN
“GET IN THIS CAR”
I wanna see Brandon Rogers vs Roger Smith vs Blitzø
u have the best voice for blitz
I love helluva boss so much
Hilarious and heartwarming, love it
This is basically Blitzo presenting Viv with an award. Very cool to see.
I love how Brandon act like his on character, and I kinda love it lol
Thats cool and all but when will we get more Hazben Hotel?
whats the song at 1:30
So is this blitzøs human disguise orrrrr😂
2:05 I don't have dementia I'm stoned mf lmfao
Her face 😂
IS THAT DONNA?!?!?!?
How characterful
I miss the old vids when he pretended he was 7
1:03 bro just broke two laws 1.not handicap parking 2. Parrel parking
You guys deserved that award and more.
YAS
Blitzo was made for you Brandon, he is literally you but in cartoon demon form
Viv looks like Angel Dust and it’s the best thing ever 😭😭
Vivienne deserves the world. She has worked so hard and earned her success and it's unfair to see her receive so much hate. This truly was both hilarious and heartwarming.
The thing that is most relatable in this video is i wanna go home
Epic
I didnt know he voiced him
Man, blitz really is just brandon turned up a little bit. If i closed my eyes i could picture blitz saying all this stuff.
Brandon kinda acts like blitzo. Even drives like blitzo
Vizie looks so depressed lol
I was at Animate and wanted to thank you I was the one that had you sign a image for my friend be cause her aunt died and she loves it it was truly a honor to meet you Brandon
This is amazing
I still find it crazy how I used to watch Brandon Rogers everyday back during the days of Vine, and now he's voicing the main character of my favorite show alongside so many other actors I adore
If this isn’t staged I’m personally scared of this person
God I love him so much he's so damn funny
I wanna do a meet and greet with Brandon but the fact that he can do this and not give a shit is amazing and scary at the same time. Also YAY VIVZIE!!!!!!
They called me a opossum (I did not know opossum was spelt o-possum)
Still upset Brandon hasnt sung as Blitz in the show yet. He could do it
I’ve been watching you for years I’m so proud of how far you’ve come as a voice actor and comedian thank you Brandon rodgers for everything and much more
Blitz never get old lmao⚰️
THERE IS A BLITZO PUPPET IN THE WORLD HELL YEAH
brandon u have changed my life for the better if u didnt make these videos i wouldnt wanna be here thank u so much for all the help i just wanted to tell u im gratefull ur here and thank u again please keep goin on the fun in helluva boss and the shows u make they make me happy thankk youu
HB has really gotten me through some shit 😢 love you guys so much ❤❤❤
Tbh whenever Brandon Rodger post a new video it always makes my day
Loving y'alls work!!! You deserved that award. Please keep chasing y'alls passion
all the cast and everything it's just perfect
This is why you made my life fucked
My favorite series on YouTube! I’m happy to see that it’s still rolling on! ❤
1:36 SLAY IT!
brandon is my favorite person ever
Wouldn't be surprised if they got hellava boss on netflix of sum
🎉🎉🎉
just like helluva boss
The way he loses it while calling her from the car 😂
Make a part two of no parants
She looks like she is being kidnapped
You actually voiced blitzo HOLY SHIT IVE BEEN A follower for years not on this account tho
If I had the chance to meet her I would take it
Your video made my day when I was with depression thank you for make me laugh 😊
Brandon Rogers is truly the perfect person to play Blitz
OMG I LOVE BRANDON SAW HIM IN CANADA FOR THE FAN EXPO AND ALMOST CRIED HE SUCH A GAY- I MEAN NICE PERSON
DON CLICK THIS 👉 0:39
0:04 THEATRE CLASS REFRENCE???
He's so irl blizø😭😭
Yippee
I feel like blitzo would drive a civic
Very funny and epic
I just watched OOPS, I can't stop seeing Blitzø chasing Vivienne around the City going "Get in the car Bitch!!"
This announcement had me just as happy and excited when Blitzø rekindled his friendship with Fizz.
This is beautiful
He acts just like blitzø 😂😂
IF THEY COULD BUT THIS SHOW IN A DVD I WOULD TOTALLY BUT IT 💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳
“You are making this into a way bigger deal than it needs to be.” ~this entire video
Yall better know how much this show means to us
The part where bro drove into fence 💀☠️
Literally brandon is naturally animated!! Haha I love his energy ❤
I know this is about Helluva Boss, but this killed me "Dementia?! I'm stoned mother f**ker!!! *SMACK*"
I love this man so much I swear😂
y'all this made my day.  I had a REALLY bad day at school and an even worse time earlier, but this made me laugh and smile.
You were one of the voice actors for helluva boss
:o.....
0:10 Porque esta censurada la marca del coche si luego se puede ver¿? XD
We love you bizzo the o is silent
I bet someones working hours or days just to make a animated version of this lol
Was this loona or millie??
BRO WAIT HE VOICES BLITZ? BRO HUH!?!!? I KNEW BLITZ SOUNDED FAMILIAR OMG.
You made blitzo blitzo the o is silent
I’ve watched every helluva a boss
0:20  The pure hilarity of him running away while losing his pants will always be my favourite XD  And congrats to the amazing Vivziepop and Helluva Boss!!
this is weird and crazy but in a good way
L
To quote Blitzo in S1 Ep3, "WE FUCKING WON!!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"
Vivian is amazing! Her art is wonderful
Sup Biltzooooooooooo😀
You need to hook up with @IzzyInsane_ and collaborate y'all'd be epic in his together
I didn't know... I didn't know he VA's Loona!
I half expected him to just take the award and be like “nah nah nah this is for me btch”
Brandon. You are genuinely one of the greatest people ever! Thank you for existing ❤
I love him😂❤❤❤
😂 lol
AHHHH OT WAS SO CUTE😂
day 1  of saying what i love about brandon and his videos hes funny  and can put a smile on our faces
This is nostalgic man I watched Viv 8years ago this is really funny man lol XD
😱At least he didn't reference (OR SHOW) the mountains of porn that exists of this damn show😱
Someone's having fun.
1:22 Yay it's Brandon puppet!
I feel like blitz’s actor isn’t an actor. Just some random dude they found in a bar
"GET IN THIS F#$%NG CAR"  "Yeahhh, nooo, yeah, nooo..nooo..."
VIVZIEPOP LOOKS SO SCARED
YESSSSSS
This guy’s talent never fails to amaze me. 😂
So chaotically unwholesome and then it ended so wholesome wtf
Yay❤
I had the hardest fucking day today, this made my day.
this shits embarrassing asf both for helluva boss and urself, (helluva boss sucks anyway)
rip viv's frontyard
Idk why but this reminds me of a the office skit
Why do people constantly comment how'd it moves can do all this in Broad public as if they forget this is all planned
brandon makes the best content
that slap xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Let’s also all agree that Brandon was perfect firstly the voice and secondly he is blitz if he was a person 💀
BLITZO PUPPET BLITZO PUPPET BLITZO PUPPET-
The fact that Brandon Rogers themselves pronounces the name as "Blitzo" means we were all wrong and the "O" isn't really silent
I can tell vivzie was very uncomfortable
bradon Rogers BRANDON Rogers brandon grogers
i heard if u spam.a.  creators nqme u get pinned
She looked like she was having a great day
This is probably the most genuine and sweetest video I've seen and i love it.
I can’t get over how the scarecrow gets fucking destroyed when Brandon reversed
This mf went from embarrassing himself in public to staring in one of YouTube’s best animated shows at the moment. DAMN Edit: poof Viv, I can’t believe what this man did 😂
I went to Italy (specifically Venice) and I met a tour guide named Giovanni who was basically Italian Brandon Rodgers, down the appearance and humor.
I feel like if I ever got a voice acting role, this video is what I'd realistically do. Although, less destructive, at least.
Brandon Rogers: "You know this bit is gonna destroy your fence?" Vivienne: "....Do it!"
W
The character blitz has always put a smile on my face because of his jokes and one of my favorite YouTubers is his voice actor makes me so happy
I KNEW I KNEW THAT VOICE
I hope she doesn't fire you over this.
Blitz is my favourite Helluva Boss character ♥ ♥
*"Dementia? Im Stoned MF!"* XD
VIVIANNE MEDRANO FROM HELLUVA BOSS!!!!!!!!!!
I cannot watch this in full because of second hand embarrassment. It rlly funny tho. XD
I'll pay to see an animation of this right F*cking now.
Congratulations to Vivienne Medrano, Brandon Rogers and the entirety of the Spindlehorse crew. Helluva Boss has become one of my favorite shows and definitely deserves the award. 🎉🎊😁   Also, I really hope that was a fake mailbox put out for the skit. 😂😂  Well, I'm sure Medrano is very used to Brandon Roger's energy.
666k views 6 days ago All is right in the universe
Sam and stuff was 5 years ago😢
666k views 6 days ago... this isn't a coincidence...is it?
the fact this has 666k views makes it even more funnier.
Poor Viv Must've Been So Embarrassed Lol, Also Congrats On Winning.
666K views. Perfect.
BRO THIS HAS 666K VIEWS. IT FITS PERFECT ABOUT THIS VIDEO.
Why when I watch it there is a 666K views? XD
Bro won🔥🔥🔥
This is why I love your channel and all the videos you do, just random shit happens like crashing into the fence. Love your videos and love you <3
2:06 i'm stoned mf
I’ve followed Brandon Rogers, spindlehorse and the team since day one, and I’ve seen them become more and more popular! I’m so proud of all of you guys and the production...Helluva boss is an absolute sensation as will hazbin hotel! (It already is)
this is so hard to watch poor viv looks so uncomfortable 😭
That security guard was hot. :u
The best thing about Brandon is his nonexistent filter for his attitude
The porn is fire doe
He's so amazing :D, Brandon you are the most wonderful man I have met and you inspire me every day
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make another 💗Cathy 💗video🤱🏻!!!!! -♊️👑💋
I KNEW THAT BASTARD VOICED BLITZO 🤬🤬🤬
Congrats, and love the pop-up from Paulette
Inspiring
This is too fucking wholesome *sniff* I'm proud😊😊
2:36 in the part from Brandon says i'm gona f**** cry is very good XD
Abraham Rogers, it's me again. I just want to say again. I love your content and I love your videos
Why do i feel like somebody’s gonna animate this with the helluva boss characters..   *(totally not foreshadowing my plan)*
Lucifer approves of the electro swing 💙🦋
0:53 XD
That was amazing I loved it
VIVIENNE ME-DRA-NO FROM HELLUVA BOOOOSS
Lol 😂
Her look says “i deal with this too often” 😂😂😂😂😂
Hi Everyone
This man's videos are absolute chaos and I'm here for it. Congrats to everyone on the team!
Hey Brandon I really want you to bring back the painted clown and the magic fun house and make the main characters meet
this makes me love helluva boss more
Absolutely love this, we’ll deserved as well haha 🙌🚀
Can we get Donna to voice a character
😂😂😂😂😂
this would be easer to watch if i didnt know she abuses her employees
omgosh this was funny and super sweet!
I just feel bad for Vivian, she had a tough time with the Lackadaisy drama and she’s honestly underrated for her team, I just want to protect her from all danger, not ruin anything for her, she deserves better.
Using the Skyrim method I see
Brandon is my spirit animal
Heck yeah! Helluva Boss won the Streamys Award! Plus that video with Brandon Rogers acting as Blitz is awesome especially with Vivziepop's confusion at first.🤩😂😅🏆
1:19 DJ BLITZO! 😂
0:36 GET UP😂!

0:31 VIZ 😂
0:27 BIP BIP
IM SO HAPPY. The show is one of a kind, and in every way a work of art. You guys deserve the recognition, I hope one day we can see helluva boss get picked up by Hulu or someone and they really let y’all go all out
We love the worst show ever made 🥺
I love that you can tell she was not expecting some of that stuff
This made me cringe way more than the actual schoolgirl moxxie episode 💀
I'm so confused 😂😭
just brandon rogers being himself is just.....blitzo
And that was the day Vivie regretted hiring Brandon
nice 👌 Brandon made my day
“dementia? i’m stoned you mf!!” im definitely keeping that in the books for when i’m 70 if i get there
Brandon rogers is hilarious
Omg I watched this in the streamys
I LOVE BLITZ AND U❤
k yeah cool, when the next ep tho -_-
This guy is the next Jim Carrey
I don't even think Helluva Boss is a good show... but Goddamn, Brandon knows a thing or two about being funny. 😭😭
Long time, still hits the same😂
Helluva wins because you are Helluva Boss bruh It's nothing without you
I think he enjoys the role of Blitzø very much lmao
Brandon is so underrated and he deserves it all for helluva boss👍👍
congratulations
Official certified verified shitpost
Low key Brandon Rogers is the best content creator on YouTube.
My Favorite part 0:26
Love u guys from one nobody
very intimidating
What the fuck blitz?
I could NEVER do that in public
I love that they had an unedited nice moment right at the end
Holy shit I did not realize you two were the same guy and I should have
*Kharn approves the frantic amount of energy shown in this video.*
Damn, never knew Brandon Roger was blitz voice because I haven't been on YouTube to much cause college life sucks.
I get it now it’s helluva boss as in hell of a boss
brandon has balls do this in front of a resturaunt
Brandon is so funny and animated! The skit is hilarious! Congrats to Vivienne, Brandon, and all of the crew of  Spindlehorse! I love helluva boss so much and looking forward to see another episode! ❤
Someone fucking animate this.
Yes.
The dude who’s just peeking over in the bush
Bruh, the moment I saw the video and that it was posted by Blitzy, I had to watch it.
The round of slaps tho 😂

I keep thing you sound like blizo

GREAT JOB GUYS 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
XD
This is great Brandon seeing how well thought out this was and the insane positivity made my day seeing this
I genuinely wonder how much of this she knew in advance.
Congrats y'all! Couldn't have gone to a better crew.
Congrats to both of you! Also I love that Brandon plays Blitzo but is dressed like Moxxie 😂
Helluva boss I the best YouTube show I’ve seen
Is this why s2 e3 takes so long
I KNEW I RECONIZED YOU FROM SOMEWHERE
Brandon: i wont sing as Blitzo on the show because i can't sing   Also Brandon: *sings pretty good rag time here*
I know you just doing this to piss off us BFDI fans
Huh that looks like my car...
I was laughing the whole way through and then it ended so abruptly!!! 😂😂😂
i strive to get this dudes energy
I shouldn't have been eating when this video started, I almost choked 😂
What in the actual fever dream is this?? So much chaos and I can't process a single thing😭😭😭
i love how brandon embraces his character as a whole he just is blitz
(Your text here) almost killed me
"I Just wanna go home"
AWWWWWWWWW🥹❤️
I aspire to one day be called out like this like someone like Brandon. I want to get into streaming and making content. But until then I get to watch others achieve dreams I haven't gotten to yet.
ngl.... this chaotic energy was alot but the kyrics to that little ditty there were actually not bad. plus i want that Blitzo puppet copied and sold as plushies PLEASE
WAS THAT A BLITZ PUPPET?!
This is very heartwarming in many ways, also congratulations to y'all we all love you a ton y'all make us happy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mood
Wow amazing I never excepted that to happen but here we are 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
The Peewee Herman fit
I LOVE THE SHOT OF THE NEIGHBOR JUST STARING AT THE SITUATION OCCURRING ON HER FRONT LAWN 🤣🤣🤣  i literally couldn’t stop cackling my stomach hurts😂😅
i hate helluva boss mha is better
I'm beginning to believe Brandon Rogers is.. slightly deranged.
1:19 Donna got that youtuber thumbnail face
Its so over the top but it fits you lmao
Post a new vid
Maybe I should read the credit now I know why Blitzo sounded femiller xD
The chaos is bright in this one
Brandon does not need to act as Blitzo, Blitzo is already Brandon.
yippee
Not gonna lie, show is mid but this video was funny
i love the Blitzo puppet 🤣
This is the most unhinged YouTube video I've seen in a while
i relly hop this was sett up becus she is a wonderful person
this is actually so cute
Vivian is my will to live
Congratulations Brandon and the Team 🎉🏆
Congratulations everyone, it is so very deserved! And literally just those last few seconds of the video made me get so emotional wth 😆
Congratulations, i also like hazbin Hotel. i hope that one gets picked up.
Do cocaine before watching.
My name is Vivian 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭                    *dies*
❤❤❤❤
The puppet blitzø 😂
YESS
Hope everything works out for us all in the end. It’s no figment of the imagination that there has been a lot of love put into this work, and while I’m still worried about it’s future, I’m still hopeful that Helluva will iron itself out straight.
Nice that he decided to honor the late great Paul Reubens by disturbing the public in Pee-Wee Herman cosplay
Brandon ran over all her shit 😭✋
Everytime I enter the school me: 2:14 😂
The fact Brandon broke character at the end just to let Viv shine and sincerely reward her is just so wholesome.  I love these goofballs and all the hard work they put into there content and helluva boss.
I freaking love you Brandon 😂
Perfect❤❤❤❤
1:49 LOOK HOW HARD SHE'S TRYING NOT TO LAUGH
Brandon is just the human version of Blitz
Like Ryan Reynolds,  Brandon was born to be a Blitz....oh.
She looked absolutely scared but so cute I love her sm😭
social anxiety fears this man
“Luckily she’s quite durable for a animator” THE WAY I STARTED CACKLING 😭😭
it must be a hazard living anywhere in a 20 mile radius to brandon rogers
It’s the fact he came up with this ON THE SPOT is hilarious
Yay!
Bro He is the voice of Blitzo and the personality of Michael from The Office
0:07 WHAT THE FUCK
I love that even to this day, Brandon still has the same car
BRO ITS REAL LIFE BLITZO
He’s as wild as Blitz 😂
JAJAJAJA
XD what fuck
😂😂😂 This was too funny and touching.
You can absolutely tell that this man is so appreciative and happy with the role that was given to him, and he loves it. just working with such a creative team gives him inspiration.  Been a fan of Brandon and vivienne before they teamed up for the show  I’m so happy you all came this far!!
🎉🎉🎉
“Luckily she’s durable for an animator” Why, why did that make me cackle so hard??😂😂😂
I literally screamed when they won
absolutely no fuckin clue if this is like a long running joke or anything but why is bro dressed slightly like the mc from cabaret
this made me tear up a little this was so sweet lol
So beautiful 😭
So deserved
“Luckily she’s quite durable for an animator” I’m giggling
0:35 pure Blitzo(o is silent) behavior I am rolling right now, but I am happy Vivian got this this show is really good and deserves a lot!
I love that Brandon chose Alastor’s canonically favourite genre of music for Vivsie
I love you you are the funniest and funniest Person everr
THAGS HOW YOU SAY HELUVA?
Just gotta say really love Season 2 Episode 3 for you know why
I can't tell if anything in this video is an honest series of events like just running over her property and Viv's reactions or if it's all a skit. I honestly can't tell.
Most chaotic wholesome man alive
I can’t believe I JUST found out blitz was voiced by Brandon🤦🏽‍♀️ no wonder he fit the role so well
just in love with this chaotic energy
Someone better animate Blitzo for this. Oh and Viv's angel character she voiced, if I recall. xD
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 amazing
I voice acted for one episode of a small YouTube animation channel in 2018, and you can bet this is how I acted to her afterward
Vizzie just side eyeing him💀😭
1:18 it was at this moment the creator of helluva boss regretted having Brandon Rogers as Blitz as he's *too much in character*      (jk not trying to be rude we all love him and Blitz deep down)
1:27 What was the name of this song?
I really hope there is a fanmade animated version of this
This show is so extremely ass. How did it win anything? The only good part of it is the voice acting. The writing, humour and vivze herself are unbearable.
💀 brandon..
W
0:38  Mah guy just said "Does this guy not feeling embarrassed around public like gosh dang"
Poor yard
Brandon never misses he didn’t when I was a kid and still doesn’t he’s funny asf 😂
How does it feel knowin Georgina is in play boy
I was so happy when I found out they won i literally was left speechless and couldn’t stop smiling  “I’m just so damn proud”- blitzø   saw this video on instagram and I literally can’t stop watching it it made me laugh so hard I love this video  I am just proud of the team and well yea
Huge apreciation to vivian <3
2:13 “I just wanna go home🥲”     HOLY S*** THESE LIKES :0
The way he pulled up into the driveway 😭
Finally vivziepop made a new episode
Amazing
Blink twice if you need help Vivienne
"Who is the most bizarre person alive?"   "Anyone from Florida, right?"
This is why but is my favourite character from helluva boss and I mean it
autism cured ✨
this is content.
...how is it THIS clip made me realize Helluva Boss is a play for "Hell of a boss" ...thats clever. VERY *insert streamy over mouth here* clever
Will there be a season 3 of helluva boss? I got really attached to that show, and I must know how it’ll end!
i want to see this animated so bad
The thumbnail gets me every time
ok i spit out my bdrink at that puppet for DJ blitzo
wow that was amazing! :3  Congratulations!!!🎉🎉🎉
2 best youtubers having fun
😂😂😂
I love how the blurred the neighbor face
I was so happy to hear Helluva Boss won the Streamy award. Every single soul involved in the show deserves it. And I look forward to an epic future for the “Immediate Murder Professionals”!    Congrats!🎉🎈
2:04-2:16 Makes me feel bad for laughing but isn’t that part of his style of humor?
Im dead over how much Vivienne physically wants to leave :PPP
Well deserved for both of you!!!
Hello! This funny was very funny, I was wondering if I could use this audio? I will give credit. ❤️
Dude, did you at least ask Brandon Rogers if he's okay with you putting Brandon Rogers into this video?  Because I feel like if Brandon Rogers finds out that Brandon Rogers is in this video without his permission, then he's going to hire the infamous -PurpleEyesWTF- Brandon Rogers to murder your ass.
Man sitting in the booth in the back of the restaurant is an icon
this is so cute and wholesome but why is no one talking abt brandon’s blush 😭😭😭
Ok but what’s the name of the song though-
You look like if Peewee Herman had an existential crisis.
Anxiety fears him
PERIOD 💅
"luckily she is quite durable for an animator"  I DIED 1:08    NOT THE BLITZO PUPPET <3
“It’s Hollywood star Brandon Rogers!”
🎉
O.O
Magic fun house helluva boss crossover episode
OK OK OK LISTEN!!!! A Helluva Boss episode and all of the characters get turned into puppets.
Being around Brandon Rodgers is an experience, you can see it on V’s face 🤣
Live action blitzo was AMAZING
An amazing character, show, and team!
i literally said “THATS THE GUY” when i heard his voice
0:53 I'm dying 😭💀
I want to know if destroying that fence and mailbox was real or part of a bit.
I love this guy
Super happy for all the people involved. This win deserved a Classic Rogers skit~ :)
This was so cringey that I began sweating profusely.
mm... food
alright but Paulette is the real star of the video 😂🎉
The chaotic energy is legendary
Congratulations helluva boss!
Idk why but I love the thumbnail so much
I need Blitzo and Brandon for some reason now
Congrats guys! Also I saw you at Fan Expo, couldn’t afford anything but you looked cool!
This is beautiful.. also I love how Blitz literally just HAS brandon's voice and it fits perfectly XD
A creative force and an indestructible actor: what could go wrong
Brandon dude is Blitzø irl ngl congrats vivziepop
😂😂😂
The fact that Blitzo's voice actor had won 5 streamys (according to him, it is at least one) was amazing to me. I didn't know he did his own content, although the prizes are comprehensible as he's fucking hilarious.
i practically died when i saw helluva boss on the streamys i had only watched the first episode but when i saw it i remembered it existed so i watched every fucking episode
This is totally Blitzo. Like what a prformance. And you kept you esscence. Totally lived it. Congrats Brandon and all Vivzie team!
I can imagine blitzo screaming this
This some funny shit
(On 1:19) me to my friends /J
Brandon: I’m gonna cry Me: I’m crying No joke that was a good speech
Looks like blitz took the day off
wow
He has no shame, he's way too hilarious
LETS GOO
ne made sure to hit everything possible on the way in and out of her "driveway"   obviously by driveway, i mean yard lmao
Bisexual black God does not approve.
"VIVIENNE MEDRANO FROM HELLUVA BOOOOSSS!!! THERE YOU ARE! GET IN THIS FUCKING CAR, OR I'M *RAMMING IT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOOMABHSBDHSAGDHFBASHV..."* I'm fucking dying xD
Brandon is amazing
This is going to stay in my memories until I die, time to see my favorite character's voice acter commit my intrusive thoughts!!
He literally is Blitzo, there is no acting.
this goofy ass boy-
OH YOUR THIS GUY. I watch Helluva Boss but never watched your channel and so I know your voice from it, but I’ve heard of your channel before and I never realised that you were the voice of Blitzo
I don't like helluva boss
I thought blitz was gonna say it’s with a silent o❤😂
oh my god
This is so sweet
WTF
congrats yall are awesome ❤
i love the video but poor honda civic is being tortured in it lol.
someone needs to animate this.
Love the fact that Brandon managed to slip in music from Lackadaisy into his flash mob. Very classy.
WHERES THE HAZBIN HOTEL BISHHHH
“GET IN THIS FUCKING CAR, OR IM RAMMING IT THROUGH YOUR LIVING ROoOoOoOM!”
And he drives ricest car of them all truly evil 😢
AYYY! Congrats guyssss! Also it’s amazing how quickly Brandon can change from acting to being serious, it’s magic 😂
😂😂😂😂
I’m surprised Brandon’s antics haven’t landed him in police custody yet.😅😅😅
As an aspiring voice actor this is my dream
Blitzø and Brandon are literally the same person.
Brandon is Blitzo even in real life it’s awesome!
WTF??
Mooove we got VIVIENNE FROM HEEEEEEELLUVA BOSS
Blitzo’s human disguise really keeps getting better.
This is so freaking awesome lmao
❤
Congratulations To Vivienne Medrano & Brandon Rogers. Way To Go Fellas. :)
This must of been a fever dream for her
Nobody:  Loona and Blitzø:
Driving that thing like it's an Infiniti.
I love hjs energy
I could feel the chaotic energy as if I was there-
Congratulations vizvie pop you and the whole team deserve this award 🎉
This is the level of confidence I will achieve someday and you can't stop me
this is so wholesome!
I don’t know whether this has either made my day, or ruined my day but either way I really needed this, thanks!
PLS😭😭😭‼️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️
Congratulations!!! So proud of you❤️
How the hell are you able to do this stuff in public and not completely shit yourself doing so?!
HELP I LOVED THIS I LOVE YOU BRANDON (not in a weird way ew) AND I LOVED HELLUVA BOSS BEAUTIFUL
Somehow this video was wholesome ❤
🥰❤️❤️
the amount of embarressment makes me cry
Brandon once said. "VIVIENNE MEDRANO FROM HELLUVA BOSS! THERE YOU ARE! GET IN THIS ****ING CAR. OR I'M RAMMING IT IN YOUR LIVING ROOAOAOOAOAO!"
Jimmy Urine????
Q: what's a laugh riot? A:
i love how he’s really in the blitzo act and it too fucking funny 😂
Brandon litteraly being the character
He is literally his character lmao
Vib was not prepared
The was nice (and funny), congrats to everyone :3
Why doesn't this video have over a million views? WTF is going on?
Helluva Boss  is Best Respect from Ukraine!(Kiev!)   Вітаю Блеце!  Ти Молодчина братику!  з ПЕРЕМОГОЮ!
0:38 the guy just standing there
Jesus Christ I'm in pain from watching this. 🤣
YAY! Vivienne! Its so well deserved :D
The end was wholesomly funny 😂
Это было шикарно! Очень смешно, весело и здорово! Спасибо за видео! Поздравляю Брэндона и Вивьен :)
Hi blizø
1:07 bumps into courtney from smosh lmao
Congratulations, you all deserve it, perfect n the best
I read it as Helluva boss wings and was very confused the entire video 😂
Viv : I’m looking for someone who can play as blitzo for my new animated show  Brandon drives into her gate and mailbox Viv: oh your here for the audition Brandon : what audition?
Viv blink if twice you need help 👀
Here I present you the CEO of I.M.P, Blitzo, the 'o' is silent.
I absolutely loved this❤
Congratulations Vivienne! 🎉
The office got nothing on this 🔥
😂😂😂😂😂
i cant tell if parts of this are staged or not 😭
🤖🎣🦬
This is perfect 😂
Cute
I like to think this is just how Brandon is in general
This was by far the best part of the ceremony
BBBBRROOOOOO, THE LOOK ON VIV'S FACE, MAN LMFAO🤣🤣🤣🤣 aaaahhhh, she does NOT know how to handle the BRANDergy
Congrats guys! You created one helluva show. Ya ll deserve this!
Did Brandon pay homage to Pee-wee Herman?
Im gonna cry this is so hilariously wholesome
Your videos are like watching the Office again but more comedy gold. you are like Michael and Vivienne Medrano ist Like Pam
So glad to see this win.
I love you, Brandon.
Posting in legendary thread.
This man is pure chaos
So this why I think the new episode is running a bit late…
Social anxiety is scared of this guy
you all deserve awards i love this show it needs to be loads more episodes and go on forever
Every time I hear Brandon Roger's voice I think of Blitz. Every time I hear Blitzs voice I think of Brandon Roger's.
He truly is perfect
fever dream
Brandon, your the sweetest and funniest person on the whole planet.
Congratulations to Vivziepop and Brandon! Also I can actually see that Vivzie is suffering inside :)
Helluva boss is shit
When the VA is worst that the character
i thought she'd be ugly.
HELLUVA BOSS IS THE BEST SHOW I HAVE SEEN BUT MAKE MORE!
I didn’t know he was like the joker Energy guy I like it.
BLITZ GET OUTTA MY HOUSE D:<
Are they a couple?
We need a lesson on how to not give a shit feom Brandon.
I'M STONED MOTHER%&?) 😆
SIT DOWN
Brandon Rogers I love you fuck yeah you inspired me  The fact that you can do your own thing and all this fun and crazy shit it  And not feel embarrassed just thank you I was not very social in middle school but in highschool I'm the mother fucken king and queen
bro got the lackadaisy track😭
WOOOOOOOOO MY BOY IS BACK AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I MISS YOUR SKITS SO BAD your my whole entire childhood bro :D
This is beautiful
"I'm gonna cry" ❤😂
I hope she's okay she looks terrified 😂
Poor viv XD
I love just how much you get reminded that these skits are absolutely batshit insane when you get an average person in em
Brandan is funny... and Viv and her whole team work so... so... hard on the shows! The spam on my part...  A while back... was not necessary... A position of power is great! but... you shouldn't. ever. abused it! I learned that recently! And I shall try not to!
God this was fvckin golden
I'm convinced that Blitzø is the actor and Brandon is the character
he is a menace to society and I love it
And this is what happens when I get so anxious after looking at videos' thumbnails!!! I thought you were going to f*** he in the a$$
You know after all the nasty drama Vivienne has had to endure since making helluva boss and hazbin hotel, it's nice to see her get a fun shout-out from Brandon Rodgers and some appreciation from him
Badass, hilarious and wholesome at the same time! Congrats! 🏆🎉
Congrats!
Brandon really does do good for that show, he already has experience with several war crimes being loud and getting freaky all in the same second.
cutest shit ive ever seen
You know, I never saw the connection between their voices until now
i laugh so hard and idk why-
the fact you did this without bursting out into tears from laughings insane
The Neighbor be like: OH No, not again!  Vivienne be like: OH No, not again!  Brandon Hits the Letterbox: YES, AGAIN! 10 POINTS
This is pretty cool he finally acknowledged it on his actual YouTube channel
HE HAD NO SHAME
The one time Brandon was calm at the end of the vid
“I just wanna go home” 😂
The fact that Brandon came up with this on the fly the second he heard Helluva Boss won the award makes him an incredible human being
i see brendon but i hear blitz
0:28 10/10 parking
I appreciate the peewee outfit 😭
I’m more excited than you, Brandon you’ve come a long way we have ❤ I might find you I have to give you a kiss
She and they deserves it🥺
He’s got that Blitz energy I will say 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm convinced Brandon is physically incapable of feeling embarrassment and shame
My Children Are Trapped In A Tower That Is Gonna Be Blown Up in 4 Minutes And They Have No Way Of Getting Out, But This is more important
This is  just awesome
This was both wholesome and disturbing and I couldn't ask for anything better
It's awesome seeing one of the best character actors on YouTube and one of YouTubes best animators get along so wholesomely. You both bring joy to your fans and have no idea how much you're appreciated for your hard work.
It's awesome seeing one of the best character actors on YouTube and one of YouTubes best animators get along so wholesomely. You both bring joy to your fans and have no idea how much you're appreciated for your hard work.
Give us more verosika
My favorite characters in helluva boss is blitzo and moxxie

Vizie is like help me😭
Brandon you are good at acting your video are funny and I wanna say thank you for being in the show, Vivian thank you for making the  show all your animation happy and excited speaking of excited I so excited about the new episode of Hazbin hotel
"The look on her face says otherwise..."  Her face: 🫥
I can’t, Brandon is literally Blitzø 😭
CONGRATSSSSS 😆👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This guy is basicallty the Dark Version of Pee Wee Herman, and I fucking love it
I'm convinced Brandon is just the Joker from Batman
i live laugh love helluva boss and brandon rogers <3333
yes
I pronounce the show “hell oova boss” and so does my friend so hearing “hell of a boss” is so akward
See... this is cringey... but this is something Blitzo would do when he's shitfaced drunk...
Everyone hide!!! Blitzo is on coke again!
What people think working for spindlehorse is like: viv assaulting underpayed staff with children and puppies tied to sticks that are also on fire. What working for spindlehorse is actually like:
Why did this make me Laugh while Crying?
I am glad vivziepop got an award
about damn time ya made a video that involves blizø XD
All i can hear is blitz 😂
I didn't get to see you at FanExpo last weekend,  But I wished from afar.
What did they win??🤨
When is Hazbin hotel? it said it was going to release in the summer but it’s almost fall and also, is it going to be on YouTube?
Congratulations on winning on the 2023 animations awards 🏆
Extrovert with the introvert they adopted
She is like "omg please stop"
Omg blitz human disguise
Bro I saw you on a clip/ad at the movie theatre the other day ❤
Brandon never fails to spread my cheeks with each upload, filling me to the brim with happiness 😊
Congratulations to hellva boss!!!!!🥳
😂 yes animators are quite durable.
Brandon never fails to spread my cheeks with each upload, filling me to the brim with happiness 😊
You can really tell he loves what he does. I’m so happy to see him, Viv and the rest of the helluva crew come so far. Congratulations to everyone involved! You deserve the win!
So proud of everyone who put work into this show! Thank you for everything!! Congrats to Viv Brandon, and the crew of spindlehorse
This was so chaotic i LOVED IT<3
😍😍😍😍😍
I would feel so honored, this is a masterpiece
i was soo fucking happy
OMG THIS LITERALLY IS THE BEST THING IV'VE SEEN THIS EVER LIKE OMG YES VIVIENNE DESERVES EVERY AWARD EVERRRRR
I NEW U SOUNDED FAMILIAR
Congratulations Helluva Boss crew!!!
Oh she's the one who made that hot wolf girl, she definitely deserves that award
I don’t see anybody talking about the Blitzø puppet but I love it
Ok that ending was so beautiful 😭😭 man these 2 inspire me so much
There's a puppet too OMG
What genre/song is this? 1:32
❤❤❤❤ So Incredibly Wholesome 🎉❤❤❤❤❤
She had to have expected him doing something like this eventually
Looks like someones gotten way into character. Maybe Eric Andre
The embarrassment
I saw this at the streamys and I love it so much I can feel the friendship through the screen and it's beautiful!
Aw
Look up “flaccid ego” and tell me that’s not the grandpa character…..especially the battletoads call
Brandon rogers an absolute icon working with vivian the creator of fucking HELLUVA BOSS.... just wow, they've come so far ❤
Yo I did not know this is the guy!
This is now definitely in one of my top 10 videos that you’ve made, ❤❤❤
Viv is fat
YO I LOVE THE BLITZØ PUPPET THATS SO CUTE
You need to chill !
this was a wholesome video congrats for the award!
😂
2:20 best part
Helluva bullshit lmao imagine loona says that 😂
this is the most meta shit i have ever seen
Just realized Brandon is the VA for blitzo 😭
Brandon arguing with Pox from Destroy All Humans is legendary.
Oh great, Vivz's ego just gets bigger.
I didn't catch that the woman behind Vivienne was Paulette and I got so excited when I realized it was her lmao
Lol 😂
Brandon is %1000 no matter what he does
You're amazing,  I love Blitz and you're really similar to him, maybe that's why your voice suits him so much. And what you did to Vivienne was so cute, I wish I could meet you someday❤️❤️❤️ (for now I'll be just talking about you to my teachers cause I like talking and I'm never embarrassed just like Blitzø😅)
i accidentally first watched with 1.5 speed on and it makes this video so much better
This really remembers me to RACKA RACKA
This isnt a skit it's a vlog
It’s funny seeing Blitzo as a puppet
Is this a new character?
To this day I'm certain Brandon just showed up one day and they just kept recording him to compile whatever he said into _Blitzo_
That was some strong "The office" energy type of video right there😂 I loved it.  ❤❤❤
OMG you did a video about Helluva boss and I love that channel and you!!!!!
to be honest i dont know where i where i would be if this show didnt walk into my life at its darkest point, i've been loving every second of it since the pilot episode, i'm glad Spindlehorse teams talent is being recognized in what is practically a new wave for indie animation, thank you for bringing this show to life and allowing me to create many great memories i'll fondly look back to in the far future, one more to more hb 🥳
THE GUY IN THE BAAAACK 👀🤨😶
Ohhh😂
Hey my last name is Medrano😂❤️
I don't think that was actually Brandon. But instead, Blitzo just found a good human disguise and had Moxxie or Millie do the puppet work!
she looks so tired
i laughed till I pee'd a little
This is the quality content I came for, and I love it! he made the award thing in his iconic video style
Congratulations to all the voice actors and animators for working on the show and doing an amazing job, you deserve this
Congratulations guys!
I love you Brandon! No one can do what u do!!❤❤❤❤
Brandon sure acted like his character in this video.
Congratulations 🎈🎊🎉🍾 Vivziepop we love you 🇸🇻
I love you, Brandon rogers
this is cute. now kindly ask your little friend where in the FUCK Hazbin is! Your voice and Loonie's ass are the only reason I care about Helluva. I fell in love with Hazbin, and especially Angel. I need to see how bad they fucked my spider baby's voice. Absolutely insane a fan song can get the proper va but the official show can't. 😡
i wanna think that Brandon didn't tell viv anything about how crazy the video will be, just to see how she would react lol. this definitely has Eric Andre vibes/Tim and Eric vibes lol
I love this guy 😂
Thanks for torturing her she deserves it
Hmm, Let’s see, I wonder what will come up if I press the “I’m feeling lucky button…” *random man starts screaming at me*
Paulette!
I've watched this 5x now as Blitz would say: CONGRATUFUCKINLATIONS MY LOVELY PEEPS AND TO MANY MORE ADVENTURES 🖤♥️🤍
Here’s to braving the chaos… and not all of it from Brandon.
Blub
You should team up with eric andre you both are so chaotic XD
I want Brandon to teach me how to drive
lmao the laugh track at 0:44
I love this lol what a reward show!!!
This is so amazing and I love friendship
My brain screaming please tell me those are extras
The idea that Brandon is like this IRL is freakin amazing lol xD
Imagine if he just drive into the house by accident...
Imagine if he just drive into the house by accident...
Oh my Satan!!!!! Blitz!!!!!!! Hahahahahahaha!!!! 10/10 best character in the entire show!!!
1:19 woulda been better if he said, “The o is silent MotherF*cker”
Ah yes, stoned Donna, nothing out of the ordinary here
Turn this into a helluva boss episode please
😂😂😂😂😂 slap 👋🏼, slap 👋🏼, slap 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Brandon looking like a normal person at the end is soo heartwarming! 💓 lol
This is the best!!!
He really said: Get in loser, we're going shopping!
I wanna be him so bad
I teared up how happy I was about all this!!! ❤😢
This is lovely
this is it. this. love it
soo fricking nice and funny 😂 I love it ❤
Great voice actor, not very great show.
Okay but that blitzo puppet is a need
His personality is exactly like Blitzo and I love it
wtf.-.
Just don't fuck it up. I get it. You won. Just take what you get man. You only got one life
Omg i absolutely loved this video!!! I love hellavuboss and hasbin hotel and the part you play but love Vivian for making the shows and being so talented
He is like Spamton on drugs lmao
The madness in this man’s eyes is scarier than long beach Griffey but it’s hilarious 💀💀💀😂😂😂
“I’m gonna f*cking cry” when Brandon & Viv lean their heads together at the end it was just so wholesome. I love Helluva Boss so much 🎉
Is Donna gonna be the next new character on Helluva Boss?
Wait? Her last name is MEDRANO? I always read it as MERANDO
Helluva boss deserves this
I honestly keep forgetting he plays Blitzø and I kind of hate myself for it SINCE HES SO DAMN FUNNY AND I REMEMBER MOST FUNNY PEOPLE I WATCH SO HOW THE F🚙CK DO I KEEP FORGETTING?!
Congraulations.  And XD
bro i don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for or jeezus christ
How does Helen manage to come in every video? 🤔
The ending omg I'm crying 💚😭🥺💚💚
on a real note, growing up and seeing all your favorite shows die off hits heavy, especially when you get tired of the new mainstream cringe. Helluva Boss kept something exciting in many peoples lives during these past few years when there hasn’t been much that’s entertaining.
Brandon dressed up as his hero Paul Ruben
WHY ARE NONE OR US TALKING ABOUT THE BLITZ PUPPET!!!
cumgratulations
Congrats to Helluva Boss and Bryce for the big win this year! We love you all, for your hard work and the many laughs shared! (Bless for Vivzie and Paulette)
class class class class
I was laughing my ass off watching this 😂 I am a huge fan of HelluvaBoss I bought their merchandise, a plushie and a poster of you and striker fighting each other. 😊
The end is so ooo cute, I love you guys 😢💕💞💖💗💝
Bro the puppet of blittz is so cute
This is great 👍 you play all of your characters... ALL OF THEM
when the f is the new ep
Oh my lord that poor Honda Accord.
Congratsssssss🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
This was amazing I never knew who played Blitzo until I watched his megan took Anabelle's parking spot but I finally know!!
It was a great celebration there. And the way he was driving was nuts.
Cool video
1:29 *Lackadaisy drama intensifies*.
FUCK YEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
Congratulations!
I'm glad Viv got that win. It's very much deserved!!
"Dementia?! I'M STONED, MOTHERFUCKER!" i can't express how mutch i laughted at that
It’s weird having Brandon say my name since Vivienne and I share the same first name lol, why am I here-
tf is this again
wtf did i just witness ?
Blitz irl is scary🤧✊✊
When the extroverted friend invites you out for the night
PFFT THE SLAPPING PART😂
Congrats to both you and Viv! It was absolutely amazing to have met you at Fan Expo Saturday! 💕
I really wish Richard Horvitz, Vivian Nixon, Bryce Pinkham, and Erica Lindbeck were at the Streamys. They would've cried tears of joy when learning that _Helluva Boss_ won.
thanks for doing the Blitzø vibe in this video
His videos are so chaotic and fun it's the only reason i watch him
how tf was he allowed to run over those things and not get the police involved lmao
That thumbnail is genuinely terrifying.
Every time y watch helluva boss i can see the care and work put into it and how well made it is, so Helluva boss really deserved that award
I’m sorry can we talk about how amazing that Blitzø puppet is?
regret clicking on thiss
He is literally blitzo Also this is so sweet-
Congrats Vivian for your amazing success!! Its so nice to see a show I have been supporting from the start to get to a point like this❤  And there is so much in the future like hazbin hotel which fans have been stayed tuned for and maybe there could be collabs between the two shows since they are in the same universe
This must be a huge milestone for Viv. Congrats! 🍾
"To be recognised" bitch my oc was supposed to be on that place I feel fucking robbed off of the sunshine Blitz us literally the oc and everyone attacks me for "copying" yet I had it way far before even hazbin was considered to be made
You know what’s crazy, she won from her SPIN-OFF show before she could even work on her main show
Congrats to everyone dude it’s so amazing how interactive y’all are and how far y’all have come. Congrattssss
That "I just wanna go home" is the realist thing ever
When is the next episode releasing
*helluva boss
0:45 Viv: *What have I created?!?!??* *starts to panic inside*
Brandon is the funniest guy ever; he makes the show!
Congratulations, SpindleHorse! ☺
LMAO THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
He's just like his character
0:43 LOLOL “hellof a boss”
I wish he got everyone from his classroom skits in that restaurant
Congrats!!❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I fucking lost it when I saw the Blitz muppet😂
helluva is one of my favorite shows (sorry but nr.1 will always stay Last Airbender) and im really proud that i can see it from the day it started, and even see you get a WELL DESERVED award for it. you guys are doing amazing work and everyone loves it!
Congratulations
When I saw Paulette I died
I can’t believe brennan ragers kidnapped Vivienne Metropolis for a vid.
He said I'm gonna f* her dry at the end
This is what makes vizie pop work slower
He exactly sounds like blitzo!
Brandon is the living proof that it is possible to have multiple personalities in one body.
Congratulations Viv, you’ve worked so hard and your such an inspiration to me and many others♥️
The old Honda’s holding up quite well x
Brandon Rogers, you inspire me to be full stupid self with comedic acting haha
Helluva can't win against Buddha and the gods
I like the bleeding puppet   Must have costed a...helluva cash   I'll see me self out
OMG THIS IS SO SWEET!!! I LOVE IT!!
kool
I want that puppet of Blitzø so badly.
This feels like an episode of the Eric Andre show
They gotta have Donna in helluva boss
You went through the trouble of censoring the make branding of the car at the beginning but not at all later on lol. Nice Honda
I fucking love that man...
HELP VIVVIENNE IS SO PRETTYYYY
The guys dressed like am emcee, which is incredibly fitting.
On that day everyone gave a fuck
I was shocked rn
This is amazing pls  use blitzo puppet more times pls
😂
Bro give me that puppet now
this is such a fucking good video
The way Brandon shook his head while yelling "or I'm ramming it into your living room"  Funniest shit I've seen all year
Aww I Love this combo ✨
Are you high?
i was so happy
I really loved that Helluva Boss won a streamy award, I was so surprised! Congrats Viv! and Congrats Brandon! for being so gosh darn funny. I don't know how I did not realize that Brandon was in Helluva Boss after a few episodes. Still hilarious with your humour, it has been so long.
10/10 content
Brandon is literally playing Blitzø in real life.
Babe wake up new helluva episode dropped
This is the crossover I needed😩💖
Glad these people exist.
Completely nuts but wholesome.
Proud of ya Brandon
Viv looked so terrified-
It's like if Slappy from Goosebumps got his own What We Do in the Shadows skit, and I absolutely love it! 😂
BEST CELEBRATION EVER SEEN 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Congratulations to all of you HelluvaBoss Cast and Congratulations to Viv too🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
LET'S GOOOOO!!! Keep up the great work, Vivienne, Brandon, and Spindle horse! Helluva Boss never fails to make my day. I'm so proud of you guysss!!!!
Hell to the fvcking yes!!!  I must say, Helluva Boss... Is really one Helluva show ❤
Congratulations to Viv, Brandon and all of the Spindlehorse team for making this amazing show!🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
The song was good though
Oh god lol bro Brandon is crazy but Viv deserves it
Me and the boys waiting for Bryce episode 2
I love the chaotic energy Brandon gives off, definetly fits Blitz' character.
2:24 Vivienne: *makes a touching speech*  Brandon: *looks at the award like he wants to steal it*
Congrats everyone! Maybe raise Paulette's salary to $23.
Viv trying to not smile and act serious while Brandon Rogers acts like Brandon Rogers in front of her.
"Lets go pick up Viv since we love her so much!" *Proceeds to run over her whole front yard*
God this is fucking hilarious
She looks so terrorfied
“Dementia?! I’m stoned MF!” Congratulations everyone. DESERVED
Not me tearing up at the end... Yall make me so happy and i am in LOVE with what all of the cast and crew have created.
"I SPENT ALL THE MONEY THAT MY CLIENT GAVE ME * pulls out "Mare Juana" miniature * SO HE HAS TO GO" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What the fuck did I just watch
This is one of the best videos I have seen on youtube.  Especially for Award giving.  I need more videos Brandon!
You deserve this win❤🎉
Today i learned Brandon can sing.
the office vibes are undeniable😂
You guys deserve it 🎉🎉
1:23 "don't tell me what to do motherf---er."
EPIC!
0:15 h e l l u v a ✨b o s s✨
I actually wish more time and energy was put into hazbin hotel than the tons of episodes of helluva boss.
Ngl the way he was screaming put of the car window is how I would start acting around everybody if I was on Helluva boss for just one episode, lol  0:30
Viv just being like “what the fuck is going on?” The whole time and not breaking character is so perfect. 😂
I need that blitz puppet 👀
omg. dj blitz
Yay!  You won!
Blitzø is Brandon and viceversa
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssss😊
SO PROUD
Oh my god i'm wheezing
Danm I love this video this is so funny 😂 and they deserved it
I feel like Brandon is either an r rated version of robin Williams or Jim Carey
2:08 the slap 3
Love watching Brandon channel all of Blitzo's paternal energy for Loona in another form.
Brandon i saw this when I was drunk I love your videos so much 😂baby
❤❤❤
😂🤣 I love how viv is now part of Brandon chica-shenanigans ❤❤❤❤ can’t wait for viv turn to play a character on his channel ❤😂😂😂😂 I’m dead
Brandon Rogers > Rami Malek
When is the next episode of helluva boss?
WHAT IS THAT MELODY??
The aggressive support made incarnate lol
Seeing Blitz manifest in real life exactly how you would expect him in the show is really uncanny and amazing at the same time!
Please address the fans too that pronounce it as hellooova boss 🙃
The thumbnail tho 👌
On her fucking front yard are you serious? 🤣🤣🤣
Brandon can sit still :O how did you train him! that is amazing!
It's a really good show I can't wait to see the next episodes and seasons!! Pls hurry lol
“No one likes a flash mob who isn’t in it” 😂😂😂
CONGRATULATIONS! It was a blast watching the skit in Streamys vod. Everyone in the cast and crew of Helluva Boss deserves the award 🥰
I love how stupid and funny this is we  deserved it dude :p
Barden roosters can u tell me the helluva boss episode 6 season 2 release date
VIVIAN IS SO COOLLLL RAHHHHHHHHHH
He thought we wouldn’t notice the Courtney Miller cameo
They kinda felt like a brother and sister to me.
I fucking love this fandom
I fucking love you. You're just a bunch of adorable craziness with a big heaping spoonful of ✨SASS✨      🥰   Blitzo wouldn't exist without you. Congrats to everyone at SpindleHorse
Bro Where does Brandon Rogers start and Blitzo end?
Congrats bro!!
Wow, they’ve really come so far.
Not to lie that would've been insane to film
jesus fuck where does this man get all that energy? He's like if you took ladybeard and condensed him down to a small size then took another ladybeard and made them fuse.
What they need to do is put the "MOVE, I'M GAY" in Helluva boss, usually that stunlocks Brandon IRL and he does not know how to respond or react to that.
Congratulations to the Helluva Boss team!! 🎉🎉
Its all porn.
The prewee herman act is kinda creengy and then again thats BR
Ok but what is the thumbnail 😭😭😭
You’re like a gay alternate timeline version John Mulaney except the intervention only made you double down on the crack you snort from both ends to keep your creativity alive… I don’t really have a point to make, I just thought it’s just a funny image, and now it’s your problem too.
❤❤❤you are such a delight Brandon❤❤❤ I am so happy for  Viv and the whole Spindlehorse crew🎉 Congratulations 🎉
congrats :') well deserved
I love that hey finally did a skit on brandons channel together. hope we get to see more! btw i feel ya Viv with being embarrassed lol
1:14 Donna is in the background!
Vivian be all like: "What have i gotten myself into heiring this guy?"
Consider
Congrats Viv,Spindlehorse, and Brandon you all create amazing projects
I hope you come to Philly fan expo I can not wait to meet you!
🎉
"Dementia?! I'm stoned mother fucker" possibly the most moving sentence I have ever heard.
That puppet was just perfect and i need to know who made it!
After watching this, I've come to 2 conclusions: 1. Brandon Rogers was perfect for the part of Blitz because he essentially just has to play himself. 2. I fully believe that Vivz were not informed pf anything beforehand and everything (from the car plowing into her garden to her burying her face in her hands in embarassment) is 100% her real reactions to everything that's happening.
I love this so much
watched Brandon for years (5 or more) and then saw helluva last year sum how didn't make the connection . love it. u go VIVVVIAAAN
The ultimate cross over
brandom rogers videos always bring me nostalgia to early days of youtube
Lol
Congratulations!! ✨✨🎈🎉🪩🦉😈
Cars ramming into easily destroyable and easily replaceable objects will never not be funny to me.
Now tell her to release more Hazbin Hotel
got to meet brandon on friday at a convention and he was genuinely one of the kindest people. have his autograph hanging in my room
CONGRAAAAAAAAATS
Can't wait to star in the show. Future predicted
I am with Vivi here what the fuck is going on
I'll be together with Aubrei by next valentine's day in 2024. She's still with her boyfriend right now. Future predicted.
Congratulations you deserve it man! I got chance to meet him on Saturday at Fan Expo Canada and he was great guy he was and he is first YouTuber I ever meet in IRL ever!! ❤❤  Congrats to Viv, Brandon and Helluva Boss!!  - Janjee
OKAY BUT WE GOTTA AGREE THAT THE ENDING WAS ADORABLE😭🤍
Congrats y'all! You deserved to win! Also, it's nice to see that Brandon's humor hasn't changed a bit even when compared to his older videos
Damn why is his cut always so clean?....
Oh no,  oh no oh no oh no    OH GAWD
An award that was well deserved and received
Helluva boss is amazing. But I can't wait for hazbin hotel either.
OMG I LOVE THAT ITS PAULETTE OUT OF CHARACTER NOT DONNA!!!
I'm so happy for ya Brandon. Very much earned. You deserve the recognition and I can't wait to see your talents get acknowledged again and again.
I didn’t know he was in helluva boss, I kind of thought it was just some stupid Tumblr show
You were kidnapped. But it seems you wanted that or you are used to it. Anyway autism ptsd is real.
I saw this during the stream. It was so fucked lmao.
Viv looks like she is rethinking her life choices. Mainly the one where she decided to cast Brandon.
CONGRATS GUYS!!!!
I don’t know about you guys but that was one helluva moneyshot
Brandom for the W THE COMMIMENT. i feel so bad for the neighbours help 😢😢
This is amazing you guys rlly deserve this
HEHEHAHAHAHAHAHH3HEHEHEHAHA
Viv just surviving the night ✨😂 soo happy for them :3
When you realize the direct spin-off of Hazbin Hotel gained more success than Hazbin Hotel.
The way Viv immediately talked about her team's work instead of her own was adorable. Congrats guys, y'all earned this one.
There’s 30 things I love in this world murder drones and hell of a boss
Congratulations Brandon, Vizie & the rest! You guys work!
Yaaaay!!!
Serving PeeWee Herman realness. Jokes aside congratulations to the SpindleHorse Team, Viv and the talented voice actors who help bring the characters to life! <3
I imagine this is a typical Tuesday for moxxie
Bro she looked so scared getting in the car 😂
That may have been the most wholesome ending to any of his videos ever
Welp he is in character. Still to this day.
got me smiling-
Viv looks like he just started doing the skit and gave her no script
Congrats! 💕💕
The work that brandon dose is amazing, he was meant for blitz
Are We Not Gonna Mention How Brandon Is Also Dressed Like Blitz?
Blitzø has my favorite energy in the show. The fact that you're so batshit insane out of the booth as well has only enhanced my enjoyment. Most perfect casting since RDJ as Tony Stark.
Half expected to hear 'god damnit moxxie' 😂  But Paulette works too
When are you going to drop the facade and just do porn? 🤣
Crazy at the start and middle  But serious at the end   LOVE IT
<3
Eyy congrats to Viv, Brandon, and co.! Helluva Boss is an inspiration to indie creators everywhere, myself included!
WHOLESOME ENDING WHOLESOME ENDING WHOLESOME ENDING
When is next season come out because I heard there was going to be a next one so I’m asking one of the stars but I did find you first so ❤️
Lol she looked like she was trying so hard not to laugh for a moment there 😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
it never clicked that you were Blitzø but now that i know it all makes sense why i love the guy
I remember seeing the pilot and thinking “huh this really reminds me of Brandon Rogers, kinda cool to see where the inspiration came from- WAIT HE IS WORKING ON IT!?!” and ya been loving the show ever since would smash.
Why aren't we talking abt the way he ran over a mail box and fence????? 😭😭😭😭
:39 LOL that poor neighbor had no idea what was going on
Bro is more deranged than Blitzø himself LMAO
When is  hazbin coming out? 😭😭😭
Very The Office Dundees-esque.
YEP HELLUVA BOSS WINS
Holy shit now that is hilarious   But fr can we all agree that they have the best relationship between an animator and a voice actor tho :)❤
I thought he sounded like blitzo at first and then thought he sounded like john mulaney and then realized it IS brandon
I cant with the thumbnail 😂
I THINK we all saw this coming when we found out he was casted
I’m pretty sure I have the same pumpkin blanket seen at the start
It’s one thing for Brandon to do dumb shit in public but it’s another thing to pull someone into it. Hilarouse
This end made me cry. God damnit 🥹💕💕💕
Heck yeah!
Love how blitzø and brandon are the same person in every aspect possible.
So happy for you guys! You all earned it!
OMG I LOVE THIS
😐
This guy has no shzme and i love it
Oh my fuck 😂 I love y’all
What the fuck is a bradon ragers-oh shit ~ sir
Brandon is the dictionary definition of over the top and I love it! 😂🤣
I imagine these two while working on HB: "We should hang out some day!" "Yeah! We totally should!" And then this happened
After the awards I went back to find this part because it was so funny to me, I gave up eventually 😂😂😂
viv so sweet of a person so is branden he ain't insane he is a genius oeople get it  right!
make more helluva boss vid
i feel like brandon would make a good Joker lol
this was funny and cute! like a video of a dumb kid doing something "funny and cute" but this is actually funny and cute.
I'm so confused on if this is a skit or real life 😂
I love how high bro looks
I love this
This was not a sketch, it’s a beautiful masterpiece
You all really deserved the award, congratulations to Vivziepop, Brandon Rogers, and everybody who has made Helluva Boss a reality. You created a treasure that the internet has never seen before and you deserve every kind of recognition and praise for making this show a reality.  Keep up the incredible work, all of you! And congratulations once again!
Wait, the Doctor Who 60th Anniversary special leaked?
this was so funny and so cute at the same time oml
NO BRANDON I’M GONNA FUCKIN CRY 😭😭😭🩷🩷🩷🩷 I’m not gonna lie this show has helped me a lot (and yes I know how unhinged this is gonna sound) hb has helped me make my way out of many unhealthy situations and has just calmed me down by just making me laugh and just for one second forget everything and enjoy myself and just laugh I can never stop gushing about it to literally everyone this show deserves this award and many more and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’ll get the recognition it deserves
wait could anyone tell me what happened? why is everyone congratulating them???
DESERVEDDDD
Vivienne Medrano, hellof a boss YOUR TEXT HERE
I hope this sh1t was scripted and staged lol
1:39 Part of Me thinks this was how she was actually Acting like This for some reason, She was so confused on what was happening  1:47 Is part for some reason is so satisfying to watch for some reason 😂😂😂😂 He nailed it with that part
I love him I crying of laughter
Dementia I'm stoned mother Fucker !!! Absolute Gold!!!
Congrats!
1:23 "and don't call me BlitzO."
Surprised the car plate didn’t say ‘wiener’
Brandon’s “I’m gonna f*cking cry” is sincere and makes you love him even more
Bruh when I first watched it I lost my mind when I heard the Lackadaisy music considering the drama
CONGRATS!!
LMAOOO THE PUPPET
Dear lord, I nearly lost it when this happened live. This is officially my favorite skit.
Congratulations you guys!!!🎉
what the fuck
Brandon: GET IN THIS FUCKING CAR BEGORE U RAM IT IN YOUR LIVING ROOOOOOOOOM   also Brandon : im gonna fucking cry-    Best part is….. thats the last time you get your dementia get the better of you , IM STONE MOTHER FUCKER
She looks so embarrassed, lol
The way Brandon congratulate Vivzie is really unique . Cant believe Vivzie VA is really unique too . Espcially Bradon , just like Blitzo
2:09 HELP
Bro really is Blitz0
What just appeared in my recommended.
Rodgers reminds me of ratigan from the great mouse detective, genie from Aladdin, and Hades from Disney’s Hercules, where they just are the character they play, the way Blitz moves in Helluva Boss is so similar to the way he moves in his sketches it’s inseparable
Brandon: Hey vivian, can i do a skit with you? Vi: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
It's beautiful. Like a flaming tornado
Congratulations to the Helluva Boss team for making such a great show. It is time it was acknowledged. You deserve it ❤🎉
TALENT RECOGNIZE  TALENT LETS GOO
Brandon? Who’s that? I just see blitzø!
Oh no.
VIV IS SO PRETTY!!
I think that's the kindest version of Brandon Rogers i've ever seen
That Blitz puppet make me wanna get one!
I AM SO HAPPY WHEN YOU STAR HERE! I LOEV YOU BRADON! I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN!
Congratulations Viv, Brandon, and the SpindleHorse crew 🎉🥳🎉  I hope more great things will happen for you guys and I hope the Hazbin Hotel series will go smoothly sometime this year.
I wanna know what that song was called. I love swing music
BITCH WE HAVE VIVIAN FROM HELLAVA BOSSS😂🤣
That song was fire tho
Seeing this last night on live was..something interesting. And I loved every fucking minute of it.
I love Brandon, his chaotic energy is what I need in my morning coffee
Hell ya
1:49 her face 😂
we got viv a streamy AND we got brandon being public enemy #1. its win-win!
Congrats to Viv, Brandon, Adam, Spindel Horse and all VA.
This kinda took me back to your theater class series. Love the work both of you do, congratulations to y'all!
He's dressed like peewee human
i wanna be Paulette when i grow old.
I need Puppet Blitz.
This is both a special occasion and just a typical Tuesday for viv
Fucking deserved, the internet needs more Viv and Brandon
She definitely deserves it for designing Loona 🤤
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
“GET IN THIS FUCKING CAR RIGHT NOW FOR IM RAMMING IT INTO THE LIVING ROOAOOAOAOAOAM” - Brandon Rogers 29th august 2023   Also that theme song of her…. What a banger
CONGRATS VIV AND CREW!!!
This was my favorite part of the streamy awards. 😂😂😂
Poor viv…
Really funny but wholesome by Brandon, congratulations Viv, you have made an amazing show, this award represents how amazing you are.
Ok, who cloned will wood?
Brandon doesn’t just voice Blitzø, He IS Blitzø.
Yaaay！
i saw this last night and freaked the fuck out I am so proud of yall for winning and am excited to see stuff in the future! 💙
Brandon, how could you? The "o" is silent!!!  Congratulations Viv, Brandon, Spindlehorse, and the whole team! 🎉
I'd be fucking dying laughing if this happened
I've loved Helluva Boss ever since the pilot episode came out. 😈 I had already been into Brandon Roger's videos for many years, so hearing Blitz's voice for the first time I was like: "Holy sh*t I recognize that voice!" 👀💜 I must have bought soooo much Helluva Boss merch over the years at this point especially of Millie and Moxxie 💜💜 to help support the show. (wearing the Stolas and Octavia pajama pants atm) 🌌🦉 I hope years down the road they decide to make at least a few video games just imagine making your own Demon and causing mischief in hell and the mortal world and having the option to help or work for I.M.P. it would make an interesting open world game in my opinion. 💜😈
This was the best creator award video by far 😊
Are we sure that Blitzo is animated and isn't just Brandon Rogers rotoscoped?
Bravo, Helluva Boss team 🎉👏
This video is awesome, but at the same time I'm gonna tell my kids that this is Brendon Urie's secret brother
this is nice
I wanna see the drawing
Probably my favorite part of the Streamys... Also, how much did that "hitting the fence and mailbox with a shiny car" bit cost??
CONGRATIOMS VIVIENNE MEDRANO FROM HELLOF A BOSS ❗❗❗
been with Helluva Boss since the very beginning and this is really dope as fuck for y'all. <3
Im not even gonna lie i can only think ov whats behind the scenes. Also Viv, how do you deal with that? (No offense) if i were that neighbor i would be dying on the floor. Also (last one i promise) Viv was that your real house!? Are the scarecrows ok!? Did the scarecrows get scred of the crows after this?  All of you are masterpieces.UvU❤
this is so pog
You both make funny content atleast
2:07 - 2:11 holy shit, I’m rolling 😭💀
i love them sm 😭, the ending was so sweet too!! Helluva boss is awesome and I'm really hoping the good work keeps up! <33
this made me laugh 😂
Concrats
Blitzø (Brandon) and Deerie (Viv)!
Smosh Collab???!!
Brandon's sketches are something else, I love it
HELP NOT HIM DRIVING THE CAR STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MINI FENCE 😭👋
Ok but now I need to know what the instrumental to that song is lol
I wish I could meet Vivienne and thank her for making such an amazing show and for hiring u Brandon and thank her for a wonderful and funny an amazing show and at least voice one character in helluva boss
That's so nice congrats 🎉
Helluva Boss AND The Bryce Seties won awards!!
I'M GONNA CRY OMFGGG!!!!!! 😭😭😭😊💖💖💖

Oh my god it's like Blitz is a human.... How did I not know he has a channel until NOW?????
Own it bitch!!! ❤❤❤❤
you seem exactly what I thought you would seem like from your voice acting XD awesome
HELLUVA AND BRYCE WON TWO FOR TWO BB!
Poor viv lol, man I love helluva boss
The whole thing was hilarious (and I loved the little dance performance) but the ending is melting my heart somehow
Congrats
This was hilarious but so cute to watch, congratulations. 🥳
Wow! This is a hilarious, and wholesome skit!
Brandon is out here looking like demented Peewee Herman lmao  Congrats on the award tho you guys deserve it!!!
hurray
I have a feeling Brandon did this just to annoy vivzie
So funny and sweet 💕🤣
❤❤❤ I’m gonna fucking cry too
I feel sorry for the people who were in the restaurant, they just wanted to eat their food :(
CONGRATULATIONS!!
Congratulations Brandon! You, Vivienne and the whole SpindleHorse crew deserve this!
I can't stop laughing😂😂😂
Wait, this is scripted?
I am cringing and smiling while feeling happy and mildly uncomfortable
This was hilarious. 😂 The Blitz puppet needs to be in more videos!
hi
I can't wait too see more but stupid question will there be a zoophobia series not like I'm demanding or rude I'm just wondering
Brandon legitimately running over her mailbox made me laugh so hard.
Congrats Viv
God Brandon will never stop being funny.  He's a treasure
No one:  Him not afraid to be naked 💀
early bitches🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hi Viv, say, any sign of uh...Hazbin Hotel on the horizon by any chance yet?
This video was so funny but congratulations vivziepop and the spindlehorse team you are not only my idol but everyone's idols you deserve that award hopefully the future of your show can keep it expanding even better ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💓💗💖💘💜🤎💞❣️💕♥️
I’ve been watching Brandon for years, and have also been a big fan of internet animation. When Hazbin’s pilot came out, I subscribed to Vivziepop. When Helluva Boss first premiered, I had to do a double take because Blitzø sounded so familiar. It’s still super surreal seeing Brandon step into that world, and for those two things to cross lol. It’s really great. I hope to see Viv and Brandon both have a prolific future in the animation space.
this was truly a high point of the streamys
“What the fuck is happening?!”  I felt that-
Man I love the show it’s so fucking cool I wish I was in it man it basically was a life changer for me I was always trying to turn down my phone so my mum wouldn’t here it and I wouldn’t get my ass kicked but seriously you viv from hazbin hotel to helluva boss you have been my most favourite creator so thank you for making such a good show and having the best team to do so    That’s all folks
What a chaotic surprise!
...he portays himself as a hybridity of all the characters that he've ever acted
That part with dementia is golden xd. God I love that woman.
Helluva Boss FOR THE WINNNN!!
He's driving a Honda
I been waiting for this
And vivenne kept up the good work
The random person
Yessss
I refuse to believe Vivienne didn't crack up laughing while shooting this video with Brandon 😂
Bro this is fucking HILARIOUS.
please tell me some of this was staged
Guess thats 3 in a row you win the award
This was fucking amazing! 🎉🎉🎉
The love is so clear and obvious it makes my heart so happy! Congratulations to you both and the entire team for this award; Helluva Boss deserves it.
When the character and his actor are just the same person...  Congrats, guys! You made an amaizing work with this series 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🥳🍾
2:06 THE BLITZO PUPPET
Inhad no fucking idea he was blitz
That "Dementia? I'm stoned motherf*cker" joke had me dying so hard that I had to rewind a few times to be able to digest the last 20 seconds or so
i need the thumbnail pic on my wall
He is Trevor irl
Congrats to the both of you and everyone who works so hard on the Helluva Boss webseries! Such talent into all this!
I love that show
Helluvaboss winns
Congrats to Viv and the spindle horse team!!! You guys are constantly making us all laugh and enjoy your passion projects. Keep up the good work
this is hilarious

Lol. This was a new unusual and fun.❤  Love it
Wow a master pest best helluva boss video I ever see 😢😢😢
Whose Lawn is that?!?! LMFAO This is HILARIOUS and its clear Brandon was the perfect choice for Blitz. Congratulations Vivzie and your team
I love how Vivienne is like "Help Me" during this video xD
seeing how the actor's act IN universe are hilarious. They're all just the most extreme versions of themselves.
My father has Huntingtons and loves helluva boss. He calls it the funny hell cartoon
best day ever
I think this is the first time I’ve ever heard Brandon sound sincere and it was kinda weird but nice :)
Congratulations to you all!!! :D This is so funny. ^-^ Keep it up! :3 ❤
YESSSS HELLUVA BOSS IS THE SHIT
I’m so glad you guys won. This inspires me to become an actor myself like you, Mr. Rogers. You’re a funny guy that makes me laugh 24 seven 365. No regrets this is one of the greatest shows I’ve ever watched in my life.
W BRANDON ROGERS
It was at that moment she knew she fucked up
i didnt know viziepop had a face
undeserved , helluva boss went  to shit
Funny and wholesome. My favorite
Viv is amazing for making helluva boss, it's my favorite show and I can't wait to see the next episode💗
"Dementia? I'm *stoned* motherf*cker!"  This is exactly the type of old lady I aspire to be.   And Brandon, if you're reading this, your videos made me laugh during one of the worst months of my life, and I'll never forget that. Thank you
Perfect mix of hilarious and heartwarming, love it
THE WAY HE iS EXACTLY LIKE THE BLITZO BUT HUMAN AND IRL
THIS WAS SO CHAOTIC BUT I LOVED IT AND YOU DESERVE THIS!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I need the giant blitzø
Brandon’s work ethic is crazy not even 24 hours before this he was in Toronto signing autographs and taking pictures
😂
THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND AND THE VOICE OF BLITZ! ITS BRANDON ROGERS
hell yeah brother
I feel like blitzo would do this
Brandon’s videos have the type of slapsticks we all love.
Lmao
It was so awesome meeting you at Fanexpo this year! Great experience thank you so much
It would of been a fucking treat to see this in person XD
I have been seeing that show EVERYWHERE! on YouTube and wondering what the big deal was now I know BRANDON ROGERS IS IN IT!!! 😍
🎉Congratulations!🎉 🌈✨🦄✨🌈
imagine your just walking on the sidewalk and see that happen
Get em!
You're such a supportive friend 🥺🧡
Congratulations Brandon and Viv! You deserved this awards! Helluva boss is amazing and I’m excited y’all won. ❤
Recognized for what a satanic cartoon 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I don’t even watch much of the show but this made me laugh so hard
I was hoping viv would be in a Brandon video and it happen
You guys created something awesome with Helluva Boss, congratulations on all your success
But... but... You can't mix crazy with insanely cute!! That's forbidden!! FORBIDDEN, I SAY!
Always good to see Paulette and Jude. XD
Viv looks terrified 😭😭🤣
Wow, I didn't know that Viv was going to actually appear in this video. So much accomplishment with the both of these amazing people. I absolutely love it.❤
A**holes in Automobiles Getting Awards
💅💅💅👏👏👏👏👏
Ar you blitzo? ( the o its silence)
I LOVE THEM SM 😂
Congratulations helluva boss

Better then any parking space congratulations team 🎉
CONGRATS TO VIVZIE + SPINDLEHORSE AND BRANDON ROGERS ! 💖  y'all deserve the win 100% ! 🎉
Well deserved, you guys inspire me im working on a script to a brandon rogers style video and I hope it's good especially since its Brandon Roger's style
jesus this is awesome
I need a friend like Brandon Rogers in my life
good lord i love just how scared viv looks its sort of funny but kinda off putting lol
You are so chaotic I love it😂😂❤❤
LMAO this is so funny
Okay, this is fun as hell. I'm surprised you went this far for this. Even with the current dramas. Props.
I just got here and I love you already
So they got live-action puppets.
U are so funny 😂😂😂 I love your videos
i never noticed you were the voice actor for this show. note I've watched you for years and have seen every episode of the show
Brandon Roger's was the perfect casting for Biltzø
It's an awesome show. I will always watch. Thanks.
I loved it so much! Viv totally does deserve such an award! I love her work and love what Brandon did, his chaos is best <3
Random but sweet
I tried to watch this video three times but all I can see are onions... 😭 Thank you for Helluva Boss, all of you! You created something that made and makes so many people happy. Because of you I practice, study and fight to become a storyboard artist. And I bet there are a lot of people you also deeply inspired. Never give up, never surrender!
I don’t know what the streamies are, but whatever it is, Vivian deserves every bit of it and more
Congratulations everyone who makes helluva boss and the hard work they make 🎉
*Cameras go out* Viv: “I’m recasting you Brandon. You know I hate flash mobs”
Brandon Rogers is tha GOAT🐐🐐🐐🐐
Brandon your my favorite you Play Blitzø very well 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Holy shit im alte i was in school butt this video is awsome love blitz
"HAIL-uva Boss!" Well dang- I guess I should hail Helluva Boss.
Viv is so talented and creative
So proud of everyone who put work into this show! Thank you for everything!! Congrats to Viv Brandon, and the crew of spindlehorse
Well deserved. Congrats you guys!
Congratulations on winning Brandon. You deserve it so much 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
He’s like Pee Wee Herman on enough crack to send John Goodman into outer space, and that’s why we love him
My answer to this video is yes
You gotta respect his commitment to the bits
She honestly doesn't deserve the amount of people tryna sabotage her career.  She deserves success
Why did i not realize sooner that he voiced blitzo
I _KNEW_ we were gonna get Blitzø in a Brandon Rogers video one of these days
Poor lady 😂😂😂😂😂
“Dementia? I’m stoned mother f*****”  My queen.
"'Dementia'? I'm stoned motherfucker!" 👋  Paulette continues to be the biggest mood
Brandon never ceases to cause me joy  and laugh.
Congratulations Brandon, Vivienne and Team Helluva Boss!!! 💖🖤🥳🥳🎉🎉
The one and only blitzø!! ✨
I love the nod to Paul Rubens
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!
U guys deserve all of the love and praise! Congratulations to everyone in the Spindlehorse to team! Wish you all the best! ❤
So he IS BLITZ. NO WONDER HE SOUNDS LIKE HIM HAHA
is nobody gonna talk about how good his singing is? because now i can't get his voice out of my head
❤
Congratulations!
Branden was so excited that he couldn’t wait and drove through the dang fence and broke the fricken mailbox.🤣
Congrats indeed! Y'all are awesome!
"I won"😈
Nice puppet blitzo really love the details
1:59 he did the thing just one word of           If you don't know the thing is "god damnit moxxie
I swear to god Brandon has lost his fucking mind and he is never gonna find it because he doesn't want to find it
i love how he has no shame to just drive into Viv;s driveway
WOOO LETS FUCKING GO! Brandon's commitment is amazing, also he was literally BORN for Blitzo. CONGRATULATIONS GUYS!
This was and is the perfect way to exept an award
YES! *cartoon airhorn*
Congrats on the show!!!🎉🎉 We really won’t forget Helluva Boss❤️❤️
I really love the fact that the voice actor and the character they play are both a menace.
Did you really destroy Viv's mailbox?
Bro I love this video WAY TOO DAMN MUCH I would 10/10 ride in a car with Brandon driving, even if he crashed into my living room. Honestly wouldn't be too mad about it 😩😩😩
If Blitzo was watching this he will be all like Biltzo: what the who is this guy !?! And why am I puppet?!?
He’s even dressed like Blitzø!
OMG congrats! Helluva boss helped realize I was lgbtq and it means a lot to me so it warms my heart it’s getting the recognition it deserves❤
Congrats on the aware, and my sympathies for the state of Viv's lawn decor.
😂
Wholesome
BRAVOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was hilarious, wholesome, amazing, you guys!
I can FEEL her embarrassment.
I'm surprised he hasn't got called on by a cop or at least got a ticket for all that stunt he just pulled. 🤔
How the f*ck do I find this funny
😂😂😂THIS IS FUNNY AS HELL AND I LOVE THIS
Congratulations Viv and Brandon I enjoy watching Helluva Boss keep up the good work.

Huge congrats yall, well earned!   NOW TO BURN SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE 🔥🎉🎈
That’s amazing🎉
*CONGRATULATIONS EVERYONE* 🎉🎉🎉
You should have the whole helluva boss cast to make cameos
The Spindelhorse crew absolutely deserves this
I would pay millions to have Paulette be part of the helluva cast
Vivian, i love you. thank you for creating a show that i have fallen in love with and get to enjoy on my down days <3
I loved this live
Brandon is the MC
0:28 I hope your car's insured
This embodies chaotic neutral.
Congratulations to Brandon and Viv on your awards 👏 🙌.
This is like if getting stuck in a Happy Birthday song in a restaurant went Super Saiyan.
WINNER!!
The way that Brandon got all sincere and genuine at the end was as cute as it was brief!
Lowkey you the one carrying the show
so proud with how far you guys came so far, cant wait to see what the future holds <333
I adore you all
I FUCKING KNEW THEIR VOICES SOUNDED FAMILIAR
Good job Everyone who work on Helluva boss
2 Brandon video near each other? Wowza!
The person next door shocked at Brandon running into stuff and kidnapping his neighbor had me ROLLING XD
1:09 as a animator i am as durable as a little ceazers pizza
I think Brandon can do what ever he wants and no one would stop him.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
im 40 seconds in and im in love
I absolutely love how viv just endures Brandon’s insanity. CONGRATULATIONS QUEEN
WHY IS HE SO GOOFY
Best. Video. Ever.
Yeeeeeeaaaaaah! Helluva bosssss!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That is the most wholesome brandon rogers video I've seen in a while. And only two major crimes committed!
This is so funny! Brandon you are litterally so hallarious and I’m so glad that you are the voice of blitzø and I’m so glad that helluva boss exists because I wouldn’t have anyone to relate to if it didn’t. I love you and Vivziepop so much and this litterally made my day❤️❤️❤️
a big congrats to all of you! 🥳🥳🎉🎉🎂🧁🍰
guys I think he won
Epic!
Congrats helluvas!
Bro does NOT have public shame😭🔥🔥🔥
This is a work of art
This guy is just HILARIOUS  Congratulations Viv! Thanks for everything Brandon! Thanks Spindlehorse!
You guys f*cking deserve it! 👏👏 congrats!
Right onnnnn!  “That was my voice” Good work fam🤘🏼💪🏼🤓
this was beautiful
"I just wanna go home.... ☹️"  same, Viv... same 😭
HOW DARE YOU PLACE A DOLLAR TREE BUCKET ON VIV'S HEAD!! She's worthy of a Home Depot bucket.. And I know it's a Dollar Tree bucket because I WORK THERE, and recognize that cheap, plastic, teal bucket.
This man crazy
This is awesome
0:28 100% not expecting that XD
somebody animate this,, its not an idea IS A NEED
Brandon’s energy and dedication to character is just incredible. I wonder what the neighbors thought when this crazy guy drove up
Lmao the way they slap each other
First off, congrats to Vivienne and Brandon, you guys really poured your hearts out to give us the entertainment that we enjoy. Second of all, Blitz's dance moves tho, yo......
Congrats you guys! :D
I have no shame in laughing so hard I started crying.
How am I just realizing this
Paulette needs to voice atleast one character in Helluva Boss
I’ve seen this live last night. Congrats!
"She's quite durable for an animator" lol
Vivienne does not look like she wants to be there
Watching Brandon Rogers is basically watching Blitzø in real life.
I need to see the behind the sceenes of this funny peace art!!!😂😂
Congrats to Vivian and the Spindlehorse crew. Also congrats to Brandon Rogers for winning Scripted Series.❤
I need that blitz o puppet
I love this so much ❤ congratulations everyone 🎉🎉🎉
I like to imagine she has actually no idea what's going on lol
Blitzo is Brandon, Brandon is Blitzo.
That's the best fucking thing I've ever seen
W
AWWW THEY'RE SO CUTE AT THE END <3 I LOVE U GUYS!!
HELLUVA BOSS!!!
38 & I love Helluva Boss!👍💓.
you guys need better writers for the show tho.. it sucks and its confusing
“Don’t tell me what to do mf”
Congratulations!
Woooo
This needs to be in a helluva boss episode as a beautiful little easter egg
Viv is trying do hard not to laugh 😂
This is the best thing ever! It hits all the best points for comedy and honestly, Brandon can do a jazz number. I love it xD
I love how Vivian is just here now 😂
Like how he parked in the handicap spot😭
Brandon Rodgers content makes me wanna smoke weed just so I can watch his drug-like content in a drugged state (drugged as in high!!!)
Love to see Paulette in this
I want to assume Viv genuinely didn't know Brandon was going to do this XD
Alternate universe will wood
Congrats Vivzie, Congrats Brandon You're Both Are Incredible
i coudnt imagine going out for a family dinner and seing this lmao
Brandon you can abduct me anytime. I know it will always have a happy ending.
it feels like it's not Brandon voicing Blitz, but Blitz voicing Brandon
Wait is Donna's name not Donna..? I don't know why I thought that was her actual name
Finally. Brandon use Blitz on his videos
Awesome and congratulations
Congratulations
The dedication in this video and everything is amazing! Congrats for the nominee!
When he pulled up to vivs house and was yelling I just was picturing Blitz screaming at his creator to get in the damn car
Everytime Brandon uploads I know its gonna be a good day
The best part of the streamys
I remembered when i first watched the helluva boss pilot I was like yo no way brandon is voicing the red dude.
Brandon straight up looks like a Peewee Playhouse host from Wish
I’m dying, as I do every time I watch Brandon Rodger’s videos
Omg how embarrassed I fill watching this goes to say how good this was 😂
im gonna f*ckin cry 😭
Your chaotic energy in this video cracked me up so much it brought a huge smile to my face!
I can see blitz doing all of this
"Dementia?! I'm stoned, motherfucker!" god i love paulette
Yeah I don’t think she could have picked anyone better to play blitzø
CONGRATULATIONS!!! All of Vivzie's team deserve that recognition. The quality and effort put into this series is astronomical. Especially for a show that we can watch FOR FREE on YouTube. Thank you for all your hard work. You've made me laugh, cry and look forward to seeing that bright episodic thumbnail. It's a treat to have been watching from the very beginning. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
It rlly does win best show in the world 🥰🥰
This video actually reminded me of the theatre class days. Those were some good times
🎉Congrats Viv🎉 PD: This is the perfect representation of a introvert Cartoon Animator getting outside to the Fame by his Extrovert Friend
Love it
Amazing how Blitzo made and played his own rendition of Brennan Ragers. I almost believed he was a real human being, just like us! What a talented thespian, that imp.
Recently got Blitz and Fizzeroli tattooed on my bicep! I love Helluva Boss💖
She genuinely looks like she has no idea what was happening and regardless if that's the cassee or not, it's hilarious. I'm glad.
Best blitzø and Vivian
i need that Blitzo puppet. dont ask questions, just tell me where i can acquire one
This was hilarious and heartfelt! 💕  Seriously congrats both of you and every other person that produces in Helluva Boss!  You guys made an amazing show and you deserve this award and many more to come! ☺️🎉
CONGARTS hope all of you have a good day
Congrates 🎉
Congrats 👏🎊🎉 🥳
Winning
Lmao this was absolutely adorable
The face slapping segment was ridiculous, unnecessary and hilarious as all hell. Chef's kiss!
what the fuck just happened?
Viv is just unfazed by Brandon at this point
Im gonna cry too
LETS GO MY BOYZZZ
Congratulations guys, I'm so happy you won!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Keep up with the amazing work Brandon. 🙂💗💗
He fits the role of Blitzo perfectly.
So... is this canon to the Helluva Boss universe...
I am so proud of all of you<3
"Vivienne, VIVIENNE. GET IN THE CAR NOW, GET IN IIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!"
I need that muphet Blitz, he is so cool.  P.s. congrats Viv, Brandon and others
😂
Congrats y’all!
That award shit rigged af. Meatcanyon should’ve won
HELLUVA BOSS >:D
Brandon literally carried the whole show with Blitzo
Lmao i fucking love this dude
Im so f*cking happy  And this is extremely hilarious as usual
CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AMAZING Talent & Hardwork you guys have put in this amazing show. All I can say is: Keep up the amazing work, and I can ALWAYS  be patience whenever HB & HH pops up. You guys deserves it🤙🏿
I fucking love this dude 😂😂😂
Omg i knew  that voice sounded similar
We wanna meet you one day. You should do a meet and greet because we love you and your Blitzo character you starred in in Helluva boss.
Wow good for the group ❤❤❤
Mazel tov! 🎉🎉🎉
Les go
IT HAPPENENED YAY WOOHOOO
Not a win,y'all don't deserve that award,the jokes are terrible,the writing is dog water,the cursing just get obnoxious,the characters designs are trash,and y'all were placed against small creators who don't have any of the sh y'all have (funding, professional animators etc) over all your show is trash
Totally deserved, from animation to storyline to character choices. Helluva Boss is an extraordinary show with such a different taste yet long needed. I applaud everyone for making it and being a part of it!
I would bet that Viv was not told about this at all and brandon just texted her he would be at her house in 20 minutes and basically just kidnapped her
I love you guys ❤
Viv is beyond embarrassed but anyway congratulations on winning the streamys
Congrats ! :D
Viv is realizing she hired a sweet person. Crazy, possibly chemically unbalanced, but sweet…
my heart!✨✨✨
1:06 I felt so dumbfounded when I figured that he didn't edit a 2nd one of himself in. That woman sitting in that chair looks scarily like one of Brandon's characters
CONGRATULATIONS VIVI🎉 Helluvboss has really inspired me and I’m just so PROUD 🥹
congratulations vivziepop & brandon rodgers
I can't tell if Vivzy was in on it or not.
Wait ur the voice actor for blitz
I love Brandon so much
“Dementia!? I’m stoned mother$&&)er” (me) and I thought Brandon would be stoned too but I was wrong
I got to meet Brandon on Saturday at a con and he was the sweetest person I’ve ever met 😭♥️ You can really tell he loves what he does. I’m so happy to see him, Viv and the rest of the helluva crew come so far. Congratulations to everyone involved! You deserve the win! :>
CONGRATS!!!
truly this was the thing of all time
You guys deserve this award and SO MUCH MORE!!!!
Aw. ♡
Congratulations to the entire team of HellvaBoss. You all have worked so hard and deserve it so much. From the voice actors to every animator. Congrats to all of you
I never got to see Viv in person! I love her and her stories
Social anxiety is scarred of *him*
I literally started fucking crying I'm so happy
WOOOOOOO❤
I got to work on a few of these episodes and I've never been more proud working on a project! Congrats Viv, Brandon and the Spindlehorse Team!
Hilarious, and then touching... Classic Brandon Rogers video :)
Congratulations! Vivziepop and Brandon and everyone else who’s part of it did amazing! 🎉
I hope Brandon and Vivvian are like best buddies
That is one oxymoron of a car
Congratulations!!
I think Viv has the need to move now lol.
I remain watching this on the streamy
helluva ✨BAWS✨😭
That was such a heartfelt moment at the end ♥️♥️ congratulations!!! You guys are so amazing!!!
holy shit lol
Congratulations the two of you 🎉
Hell yah you guys fucking deserve it!
Congratulations Helluva crew. Can't wait to see Hazbin hotel get the same love
“Brendon Ragers”
These are your coworkers 😂 definitely will make you rethink why you hired them lololololol
Brandon deserves better than this show lul
If I could, I’d give this a thousand more likes!!
1:27 I really need to know if the electro swing played in the restaurant was made just for this segment or if it actually exists. Ande if it exists, please TELL ME ITS NAME
Congrats on winning!!
I'm so happy 😭 I love the show more than any YouTube show
another hilarious and peak video from the man himself.   CONGRATS TO VIV, SPINDLEHORSE, AND ALL THE CAST OF HELLUVA BOSS FOR DOING SUCH A AWESOME FUCKING JOB AT CREATING SUCH A MASTERPIECE OF A SHOW.   Helluva is my favorite show and its just so nice to see it getting the recognition it deserves.
Brandon and Vivienne are two of the best youtubers out there. Period.
𝕊𝕠 𝕔𝕦𝕥𝕖. 😚
I love how he just announces her status of being the creator
HAHAHAHAAHHAHA THIS IS FUNNY
Hooray you guys did it
I’m not really a fan of Vivian but I recognize her talent and tbh Brandon Rogers is the one carrying Helluvaboss
Yay! Two of my favorite people in the same car! Thank God!
I would love for some kind of hellvaboss + Rrandon rogers non cannon skit. Blitzo vs tankthrust would be amazing.
I never knew he played Blitzo until now, honestly makes me like Blitzo even more
Best way to honor your boss
LOVED THE VIDEO YOU GUYS MADE 😭 It was funny but also very nice at the end.
Congrats! I love you and Viv. Helluva Boss is one of my favorite things and I can't wait for more episodes.
Can we get a round of applause for the commitment 👏👏👏
Gratulations Brandon rogers and I’m fan of vivziepop and that’s very surprising to see Vivienne medrano the most best artist ever😊❤
I lost it when I heard that Helluva won, this award is incredibly deserved by everyone that put in the work for this show, Congrats! ❤️
1:07 wait did brandon just bump into himself how-
Was Vivienne genuinely freaked out by Brandon’s tomfoolery, or was she just playing along with him. If the former were true, I bet she now knows how Moxxie feels having Blitz as an employer
0:49 Buckle up Vivze, we're doing a Shrek
She's so out of place in Brandon's world it's amazing
Imagine if the voice actor for Stella was in this cuz isn’t she in Brandon rogers vids aswell?
This video was the best surprise today. Thank you all for what you do here on Brandon's channel and the work done for Helluva Boss 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
We love you ViV! Thank you for making a show so great it gave me and my sister something to bond over
Saw this last night and had the biggest grin on my face
HE IS LITERALLY HUMAN BLITZØ WHAT THE HELL LMAOKL
congratulations guys, you deserve it!!!
I did not realize that Brandon was that agressively smooth.
Let’s go Vivian!
This isn’t scripted Brandon rogers is just a sicopath
hellof a boss is certainly a good show
I can't tell if he is committing to the character or that's actually him
and imagine him walking into a resturant that u were in
nice, man
imagine being vivseis neighbor.
Is this Blitzø in a human disguise?
Helluva Boss YEAAA!!!😄😄😄😄
Not to mention, but i believe Blitzo is like being himself for him. He must feel great being payed to be himself
Vivienne's reaction was like "omg... I want to go home"
this guy might be my idol
My name is Vivienne I'm so happy ❤
Amazing vid out of all
I just realized, Brandon Rogers is just John Mulaney if he didn't regret doing all of those drugs.
I stopped having sex to watch this. Worth it
I’m so happy both Bryce and Helluva Boss won
"She's very durable for a animator" I FUCKING WHEEZED

Aww, I'm so happy for both of you!! Congrats!! 😍🎉❤🎊
Classic Brandon Roger. Starting it with chaos, ending it wholesome ❤❤❤
WHAT
…
The way Brandons human persona is crazier than his Demon one😭
I'm early to a brandon Rogers video?
Victory "Hazbin" Achieved.
Did he bump into himself at the resturaunt
careless, loud, yep, defo human Blitz
Congratulations 👏👏👏i love the show you made❤
I mean this in the nicest way possible bc I love this content but sometimes I think he got dropped on the head as a baby but I think I did aswell so I can't say anything
Congratulation to you, Viv, and the Spindlehorse crew. We love you all so much!
Yes indeed this is what I call true television or a picture show
Hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha!
Not the neighbor😭 I love that brandon does his skits with reckless abandon, and all public reactions are genuine. Like when he got banned from vidcon UK
Keep up the good work hellvea boss
My heart snapped in two at the end, that was adorable I didn’t know my heart could do that
Brandon if your reading this comment how big is it
I have never agreed more with who an awarded given to, you all work so hard and do such an amazing job with a show that million people love including myself
😂😂😂❤❤ love this
My 3rd hand embarrassment could N E V E R

Congratulations!!! 🍾🎊🎉🎈
I LITERALLY SCREEN RECORDED THIS LAST NIGHT 😭😭😭

absolutely amazing video, and congrats on her reward
this was truly a video of all time!
No, WE WIN.  Gimme my fking trophy, and my name better be spelled right!
This man is the definition of 'I was born against my will, and now I'm gonna make it everyone else's problem'
Vivian is hot af!!!
You guys are f*cking awesome!!!! Wooooooo!! Congrats!!!!
8=~=~=D
I can’t with this 😭😭😻😻😭
Viv: "WTF is happening!"  Viewers: Your in a Brandon Rogers video my dear xD
I want to see puppet Blitzø appear in Brandon's videos or else I'll pull a 9/11 on a 7-Eleven
goofy ah
Such a wholesome video
Idk why but Brandon’s videos always make me feel at home. And I always end up crying at the end of them. Then I just re watch stuff with Sam and Im good again.
Wooo yay btw where’s the new episode
Brandon you did it again you beautiful bastard
I bet she regret to hire him
I fucking love this video. The CONCERN on her face lol
Congratulations!!  Such an awesome show with such incredible talent behind every part of it.  Well deserved.
AWWW😭😭 this video is beyond adorable
Anyone else has been mispronouncing "Helluva" in "Helluva Boss" as Hell-uva Boss? Like Hell-oo-va- Boss. The correct pronounciation is Hell of a Boss, but I've been saying, Hell oove a Boss. In IPA, that would be the sound /o͞o/ in food, moon, fool, school, and swoop. So it's Hell + /o͞o/ + va + Boss
I love him
Well deserved congrats to you Brandon on you’re win and congrats to Vivzie and her team on their win❤️💖🤲🏽🦭🌸✨
....why do I get the feeling this isn't just heighted for a video, and Branden actually drives like that.
congratulations 🎉
I love Brandon and Vivian so much! This was very much deserved, she’s an amazing creator. And Brandon killed it with this video😂
Viv is so beautiful😍
Congratulations to you and the entire SpindleHorse crew! You guys deserve the win! Keep up the great work!
Hell yeah! Way to go people 🎉
I say 10/10 no one died
This video is absolute insanity and I love it! Congratulations!
Brandon Roger’s everyone! A national treasure and Blitzø in Human Form!!!!
This is the least expected thing I ever encountered.  Yet I still love it
Brandon makes the weirdest and most horrid shit imaginable but always finds a way to make it wholesome in the end, lol.
I like how they cut to a reaction shot from the puppet
Vivziepop threwout this video: why the fuck did I cast him in my show 😅
Oh my fucking Lucifer yes! I’m so proudddd!!! I would be doing the exact same for Viv if I could because I love helluva boss so much and appreciate everything you guys do no matter what<333333
I am so happy for you and the Spindle team. I said all sorts of congrats on Twitter but once again congrats =)
This is one of the greatest projects ever and I love the fact many people love it, appreciate the hard work
I gotta go watch this now.  CONGRATS!
This is the best video i've ever watched
Congrats Vivienne, Brandon, and the Helluva Boss Cast/Crew! y’all deserve it!
Congrats, Vivziepop and Brandon Rogers!🖤
best 2 minutes and 40 seconds of my life
Brandon is everything
This is hilarious 😂
Whose house was that?! Was a that a neighbor?!?
All hail the king(s)! And queen(s)!
She looks so terrified 😂😂😂
*When the waiters come to your table to sing happy birthday*  6 year old me: 1:18
If someone doesn’t animate this with Blitzo in it, we will wage a war
Brandon, this is the best video I’ve ever fucking seen.
Bro’s being a little too silly but we still adore him
The end sums up my emotions, congrats and thank you for everything you do.
Love the "buckle up" before hitting the sign
Dang Brandon you sure do love to make one hell of a entertaining performance and congrats to Vivien. You guys are awesome!
YOU ALL AMAZING <3
I swear I am watching Viv and Brandon’s real life convos lol
Yeah he really fits Bilitzo he radiates chaotic energy and that puppet was awesome and I want it!
I love Helluva boss you guys deserve it!
CONGRATSSSS!!!
While the show isn't my favorite and that i would have liked certain aspects be improved (writing, humour and less musicals) i respect the effort that You, Vivzie, Cast and everyone involved put in it's something i couldn't have predicted.
This is to good
i love this guy. hes so in character 💀
I guess you could call it... One Helluva Victory >:3 I'll see myself out.  (Congrats on the award! Y'all absolutely deserved it!)
YEEESSSSS!!!! I was hoping it would get uploaded here 🤣 This was so hilarious and sweet, just like this dynamic duo! Congrats to both of y’all on the wins, Brandon! Here’s to more success in the future 🎉🥳
I love that Brandon calls him Blitzo
Best thing to wake up to
How did you made that puppet of Blitzø?
Im black
I saw it this morning on reddit😂 It was so hilarious. Congratulations to Vizvie, Brandon and the whole crew
This is the best crossover that i never thought would happen
Congrats to Paulette for being high
And congrats for Bryce as well!
"That is the last time I'm letting your dementia get the better of you" 💀
SLAYYY🎉🎉🎉
OMGGG I LOVVE THSI😭😭😭
Stolas: hmm blitzy, i brought the cake. blitzo: what cake? theres none. Stolas: ohh dont be so blinded, its right in front of you. blitzo: ohh ho ho ho! im gonna stuff you like a thanksgiving turkey tonight! *few minuts later* blitzo: few that was the best gift ever. Stolas: ohh thanks. *both kissing in the bed*  THE END
WHEN I FOUND OUT YOU WERE BLITZO I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SHOW EVEN MORE. 10000000000000/10 ACTING SKILLS I FUCKING LOVE THE SHOW.
Yeah. Hell yeah.
That's sweet Brandon shown his love in the most Brandon way possible
Wait, did Brandon called himself Blitz’O’?!?!
Early
You are the best voice actor I know Brandon (in terms of being a crazy bastard)
I'm so proud Brandon. The funny Thing before Helluva Boss and you Appearance by Anthony Padilla I didn't know you. You are very talented.
He has no regards for any road safety Just like Blitzo     Yeah, that about checks out
🎉
Brandon Rogers on the show: Makes his employees uncomfortable.  Brandon Rogers in real life: Makes his employers uncomfortable.
i'd be happy for viv if she wasn't such a shit person. congrats to you though, brandon!!! <3
Without question the best moment of the Streamys
Waking up to your naked ass once again is the greatest thing I could ask for ❤
7 seconds in and he’s already naked 😂
GOOD FOR THEM! GOOD FOR FUCKING THEM!!!
The fact that he literally does this in public is even funnier.
Every fan meeting they're favorite creator be like:
i can hear the tittle blitz saying: i fuking won from that one episode
Started off in the typical cancerous fashion 😂, but ended off sweet and wholesome. Only with Brandon!
I NEED that helluva boss plushie
The Oscars have some competition
His music choice was from Lackadaisy. Wow. 😂
I've been watching since day one, The amount of work you put into everything is amazing and you have every right to deserve that award, love you, Brendon!
Cgs to you guys!! Y’all deserve it, love this show🎉❤️❤️
I watched the TikTok before the video came out
Brandon meets Blitzø was amazing.
Love this
This is adorable 😂😂
That means Oops S2 Ep.6 Helluva Boss will come out September 2nd!
😂😂
Hellabussi
Congratulations Vinnie If You did not make helluva boss idk if this comment would exist
Blitzø as dj man is so radical I love it.
Helluva Boss is one Helluva time
I'm shocked this wasn't making fun of the show. I've had to gently tell friends to stop making me watch clips of it because it is so hard to watch and pretend it's enjoyable.
Why does the Helluva Boss comedy feels good and natural? *plays video* ... oh
the BaCK UP DANCERS DSERVV UH RAISE 😍😍😍
Brandon: The extroverted friend who’s always screaming his ass off, being chaotic and violent Viv: The introverted friend who just wants to go home
What a heartwarming vid. Thanks viz and Brandon!
The fact that Viv simply endures Brandons insanity is so hilarious  And the end is so wholesome TvT
THE ONLY REAL WINNER 🎉
Brandon was actually not acting here, Blitz tried to posess him and it just went wrong
Lmao this is funny and cute
Let's go DJ Blitzo!!!!
they deserve that award
YESSSSS
YEAH 💪💪💪
Bro grats
I’m sorry but this is the worst animated series around. The artist is an awful person and none of the jokes are funny. I avoid fans of the show like the plague because they’re usually just so undesirable and annoying.
Considering all the *FUCKED!!!* up vids this man has already mde. Him just being him is the most Blitz(o) thing he has ever done.
I worship this show sense it started helluva boss is the goat
Viv is so cute and cool. Wish I had her as a friend
Congratulations! 😂🪦✨
Brandon you are an absolute riot! 😂🎉❤ congratulations to you big and HelluvaBoss
She just looks terrified through most of this 😂
This is incredible!
"Dimentia? I'm stoned mother fucker" relatable lol
0:39 HELLISH INSANITY
Yay
Amazing work!
Dressed in his best Pee Wee fit for the occasion 😂🎉
"luckily she is quite durable for an animator"
Did you see the guys from the background the face he made was so funny, Congratulations you guys!!!🥳
The way it made me smile 😂
Congratulations on the very well deserved win!!!   Also was that Courtney Miller? 1:08
His voice cracks 0:32
poor viv bro she was traumatized
Hi mr. Brandon!!!

You guys had a lot fun with this video.
This video is just brandon rogers in nutshell (congrats to viv and the rest btw)
CONGRATS Y'ALL!!
Congratulations Viv and Brandon! keep up the great work!
Dj blitzo
Why...why is Brandon dressed like PeeWee Herman?
Great that Brandon is congratulating Vivenne & Helluva Boss in his own fantastic way
Are you going to keep use the bliz puppet and future videos are only on this video
746th
brandons songs are an actual bop
1:21 I recognize that Puppet that belongs to Wolfbunnycosplay.
If people didn’t know about Helluva Boss before, then they do NOW.
Shes so confused and im loving it  I also like to think that they disnt get permission for what happened in the restaurant and i genuinely love everyones reaction
HELL YEAH !!!!! MORE BRANDON ROGER AND HELLUVA BOSS !!!!!

Very much deserved
Congratulations helluva boss on the win they earned it for all their hard work also Brandon is hilarious and amazing at voice acting                      :D

God DAYM congratulations for your biggest prize of your life's! It's actually the best what you guys doing in this!! God blessing your goddamn life's for fck sake I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,  And Hello From Russia🇷🇺 💖💖💖 Thank YOU for everything 💞🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The use of puppets to bring Blitzo into the sketch was brilliant! Hope they explore more ideas like that. XD  Seriously though, congrats to Viv and her crew on this award!! They deserve it!
0:25 how many hours of footage do you think Brandon has of him just running around in public pant less. Has to be at least upwards of 40 right?
So wholesome 🤌🏼 ❤️
CONGRATS! 🎉❤
This is so amazing
657 comments in 25 minutes? The power of Brandon😅

Congratulations 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤
That was like the sweetest and funniest congrats ever!
Brandon, you're losing your fucking mind faster than you got popular and I couldn't be happier
This is literally why blitz was my favorite from the start
The freaking thumbnail, Brandon! Jesus Christ! XD
If you don’t mind me asking is the Voice actor for blitz bisexual
Congrats guys :) you earned it
i really hope that wasnt at a real restaurant 😢
Hazbin hotel is coming up
I saw some old friends a while back. I told them I wanted to be a middle aged monster comedian. They asked who my favorite comedians were. I said "Brandon Rogers".
is this what shes been doing instead of realeasing hazbin hotel?
Congratulations to the both of you ❤
YOU RAN OVER THE FUCKING SCARECROW? HOW DARE YOU.
I'm getting Blitzo Stolas tattooed on my arm
I LOVE THISSS
I love both of your channels so facing much 🤩🤩🤩
This was really great to see at the Streamies. I wasn't expecting him to make a whole skit on it
Congratulations Blitz and Vivian!!!!  Blitz's -mom- would be really proud of him!!!!
This is incredible
Hmmmm, alright
I really wish Brandon won, but I'll take what I can get.
Vivian definitely deserves an award. I’ve been watching Helluva Boss since Ozzie’s released. It’s amazing to see how it has evolved over the past few episodes.
Cool
The best part of the Streamys !!
She deserves an OSCER award for dealing with the guy who’s horrible to his children 😅
i hope blitzo becomes a reoccuring character in this channel
I love how chaotic Brandon can be and I believe he was perfect for the role of Blitzø, but his last sentence in this video sounded so genuine that I am truly happy for all of Spindle horse, Viv and Brandon for their big success with Helluva Boss! ♥️♥️♥️ Congratulations, the hard work and effort paid back to all the cast two fold 🥳
And can't imagine how confused the neighbor was
what is that?
CONGRATS EVERYONE!!!
You are chaos in human form and I can’t get enough of it. 😂  Congrats to Vivzie and the awesome people at Spindlehorse!
BRANDON YOU’RE SO SWEET
Yay
Incredible work and congrats🎉
I 100% believe he was actually naked during the blanket reveal
Noice
Hey Brandon I know you may never see this, but the last 7 months have been the hardest for me. One night I was considering ending it all then YouTube recommended one of you videos and it made me genuinely laugh. You saved my life and I will forever be grateful. I love you Brandon keep being the amazing person you always have been. Thank you for everything!
Not going to lie you remind me of some white girl at Starbucks lol
the engineer from TF2 is deeply confused.
she looks scared
I f**king love this
Congrats Viv, Brandon and the rest of the Spindlehorse team! ❤
HELLUVA BOSS WINS!  BFDI:hahahaha...... FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

Glad Brandon and the Spindlehorse team won some rewards! They deserved it for all the hard work!
Omg we have the same car. I’ve got a bright blue honda civic
One of the best fucking shows I’ve ever seen. All the characters are likable (Loona is my fav), the humor is hilarious and not over done, great character and story development. You guys deserve it all. Thank for you creating this incredible show and for giving me another thing to be thankful for. Here’s to all the future shenanigans with our favorite group of demon mercenaries and our favorite hellhound Loona! 😈👹🐺🔥👏🙌
Now this is how you promote a web series!
🎉🎉🎉🎉 congratulations ❤
i still want to see what brandon drew for her... and I love how the style of this video is a lot like the office, like a lot like the office

Helluva funny
Congratulations Brandon and Viv!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
BEEN SINCE DAY ONE AND WILL BE TILL THE END!
0:39  Police: Um hello, we got a call from your neighbor reporting a maniac threatening to drive through your living room. Viv: Oh that’s just Brandon. Don’t mind him, he does that every other week.
Nice call back to Theatre Class in the beginning!
When I watched the first episode of HelluvaBoss when it released I know for a split second that it was Brandon Rogers voice acting for Blitzo. Seeing him in the team honestly made me laugh. he’s so unique and unpredictable in his own ways. Love you Brandon Rogers, don’t know if you’ll ever see this but it would make be blushed so hard.  To me, you made HelluvaBoss a very special show that I can’t have enough of.  Richard Steven is always a treasure to me.    🖤🖤🖤 0:10
Ye ye good for you guys!
😂😂
Congrats!!!!! so happy for you both! it completely made my day watching the Streamy Awards hearing you both win! YAYYYYY
I remember seeing this in the streamys it made me laugh so much
The font couldn’t fit in the bubble and he just went with it that’s some blitz shit right there love it💀
blitzo x brandon hot yaoi
♥♥🍑♥!  Seriously, though. Much love! Well-earned.
I Kinda don’t care. I’ve been waiting years for hazbin hotel. And at this point vivzie pop has just been stalling.

I’m so confused
Congratulations Vivienne and all the helluva boss crew

I just want to say thank you to helluva boss crew and creator herself and miss Erica linbeck For the best year for myself And every other fan. Thank you for this and I hope I get to see more of your work.

YAY I LOVE HELLUVA BOSS SM U ARE THE BEST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Please get Paulette on Helluva Boss. She would be amazing!
Without Brandon their wouldn’t be a blitzo
I wonder if Vivien was acting in this or not.
Any neighborhood Brandon Rogers emters is warned ahead of time that emergency services will NOT be avilable for the durat8on of his visit because only God knows what kind of tomfoolery he is up to
ROCK IT!!!! You guys deserve it!

Leave it to Brandon to commit several war crimes and end having an emotional moment seconds later and get away with it
Ahhh i love this!! And well deserved
Congratulations!
what
THE END WAS ADORABLEEE and the rest was hilarious. God thank you all for existing
There’s a puppet Blitzo in the Rogersverse. How did he get there? A new worm-hole?
is this the first time Brandon has broken character?
First time I’ve thought what the hell while watching Brandon.
Brandon, my dear, you're the one who deserves the most credit. One of the reasons why Helluva Boss will stand out and hold up, not as a spin-off show to Hazbin Hotel, but as the real thing, is you. Congratulations 🎉
That kick at 1:46 was worthy of the great Lenny Beige
Congratulations guys! I've been watching the show ever since the pilot was uploaded. Even though it isn't a mainstream thing on TV or streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, Paramount+, HBO Max, Peacock, etc. I still enjoy it. Keep up the good work!!
Well... that's one way to ensure your property taxes are low XD
We love you guys!
congrats guys. 🥺 honestly I wanna animate this with Blitz and Keenie or Dearie since viv voices them. 😂
Deserved / VPOS
"I'm gonna fuckin cry" AND WE DID🎉😭🎉
Woohooo!!
I want that Blitz puppet
I love that you’ve always had blitz energy irl. It’s like you’re always in character.
I think this might be the first time he’s referenced the fact that he’s in helluva boss on his channel
EVERYONE LIKE THIS COMMENT I RILY WANT MY FATHER TO SEE THIS

Vivienne “Helluva Boss” Medrano.
I  watched this yesterday live on the streamys
EARLY! Also this is amazing, remind me of Helen’s chaotic energy a bit heh,.
Lmao! Can't love you anymore than I do Brandon 😂😂😂😂😂
Brandon never fails to spread my cheeks with each upload, filling me to the brim with happiness 😊
Honestly, this was the best part of the Streamys 2023
Congratulations Blitz
I was so excited when they announce the winner
I remember watching a compilation of just Brandon Rodger’s clips from the streamies and this is so weirdly wholesome 😂
I love how Viv is just so confused the entire time lol
I love how everyone else was like a casual giving of the streamy and you wrote an entire sketch
👏👏👏👏
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎉🎉

Jesus lord.... You stay the king of Sensored Comedy.
i love being early for brandons videos he's clinically insane at this point if he wasnt already
the energy brandon rogers has is something I wish to have when i am that age, or at any age at all.
Just as unhinged as usual
*Vivzie is love...Brandon is life*
The commitment Brandon has in playing his characters is so hilarious and amazing
