mulaneys was the best idcare 😂
Comedians stupid enough to make fun of our President, who got the majority of the people's vote are not intelligent enough for me to watch.
😂❤
If only they could've left out Chapelle. Sigh.
Dave Chappell is the best comedian of all time hands down
Tripping is actually one of the most common injuries for people
That was a lot of video for very little laugh. Most of it was unfunny as f.
NOT FUNNY
At what point will the world stop pretending Trevor Noah is a comedian? Calling him a hack is an insult to hacks.
"Trevor. I've met Trump." What a cheap ass lame joke. Is that all you have?
Hasan Minaj and Trevor Noah are two of the least funny people alive. They might be neck and neck for the top spot.
People are weird. Celebrities just have more money to bring their weirdness into reality.
I hate when comdians use fakr laugh tracks... That rolling laughter is so fake a bad
A great man. 😐🫡
Chris d didn t estimate young ppl don t know Who Phil Collins is
No one touched Chappelle, guy is unbelievable!
The Steven Tyler / Bon Jovi call was the most NY thing I can imagine!
If Neal Brennan never met Dave chapelle he wouldn’t be here
Not one woman in the bunch?? Geez boys!
It's ironic to hear [Patton Oswald] a man that was involved in Pizza Gate refer to anyone else as weird...🤨
Chappelle talking about his jealousy is so real 😂
Yeah i'm sure those dudes aren't weird either
The hilarious part is they ARE celebrities. They ONLY hang with the biggest people.
I really thought it would be Dave Chappelle talking about OJ
So nice that Trevor Noah got shoe horned into this compilation.
Money and fame tend to fuck with the human brain.
It’s the adrenochrome and baby’s blood
Shit Bloomberg’s a REAL self-made billionaire at least.
To an skip past the first 7 minutes…. I didn’t even smile.
You KNOW Chappelle is complaining to his agent 😂
Trevor Noah ruins everything
Really? The Trevor Noah bit? Just a 20 second quick dumb Trump slam? You felt the need to shoe horn that in amongst all these other actual stories?   Lame. Really.  Super lame.
I gotta sneaking feeling, this is NOT gonna age well. More people are gonna busted.
The irony is a lot of these guys like chapelle and mulaney are unhinged themselves
"That's not true....I've met Trump"....That Barak knows how to sucker punch.
Dennis broke his collar bone in the gang goes to the slopes
I've got news for these guys: most all people are really weird. They just have an easier time hiding it.
Trevor Noah is the biggest sellout loser on the planet
Celebrities talk about celebrities
Urrggh how do you get fat on your pizza? Unless its Olive Oil drizzled on your mozzarella its grim Americana and an International superstar like Tyler can do what he wants
It was great until that hack, Trevor Noah. He ruined it.
Patton Oswald.  Why name a lame ass basterd after such a great man... a great man.
Trevor Noah is so unfunny.
All my comedy heroes in one video!  ROCK: And Chris Distefano
Patton's holding Koolness 2 nother level sik he looks handsome.
I was just checking out the pic of Steph taking the 3pt record breaker and I'll be damned... There's Jon, there's Pete..... Ah! There's Chris over there, a couple seats down. Right baseline.
Was Patton Oswalt ever funny? That guy sucks.
Hey TREVER.....how's not having a show feel?  Make fun of the GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER again, you damn DUMBASS.  Goodbye.
Who’s Glen Howerton ?
John mulaney ❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Man alone suffers so much then he compelled to invent laughter-comedy definition  Give me chance i will make better comedy than this
Glen who?
Trevor Noah's joke was a compilation of his entire body of work.
Head of Netflix can't be that great, his company can't stop cancelling  their original movies and tv shows... 😂
YO BON JOVI
Napkin blottin oil off pizza is a fuckin sin!!
Everything patton oswalt says is just so bitter and unfunny. Not to mention timothy olyphant says he is the biggest douchebag to ever work with and he said it on conan. He doesn't bullshit. Fu patton
Chappelle show was only good because of CHARLIE MURPHY period! It was HIS jokes, his skits, HIS stories are what MADE that show, plajn and simple. The network made a huge mistake not continuing the show by giving it to Charlie to host, that would have been epic and even better than Chappelle, no kne acknowledges Charlie at all. His hollyweird stories are the entire show. They brought in comedians who were not funny, Chappelle was a good man however Charlie was not given credit when it was him, so strange no one realizes this.
By the way, don't even try it. 2332 is not the real code. You are not and will never be cool enough to have the bathroom code to the Starbucks in Times Square.
Good compilation of comedians and That guy Di Something
Why is netflix a joke?
Neal Breanon is funny
I tore a ligament on my ankle because I twisted my foot on a rock. So I feel you Patton
12:57 0⁰
He landed his Dogtown Wrong🎉😂😂😂
Omg all are funny,  sup with borat?
lol literally all of these people are “celebs”.
Full moon
Portugal.
😂
🤣🍔🍔😍
😂🌭🌭🍔🍔🍔🍔
I thought Glenn was skiing not snowboarding
Chapelle is the GOAT! He makes Trevor Noah look even more weak, lol.
I kind of expected more from the stories. Just saying.
I really enjoyed the last bit about Mick Jagger!
99% sure Chris Distefano doesn't have a father and all of his bits a just slightly reworded stories he told kids in school about how cool his dad is.
Layman: a vertical = skater: a McTwist.  Actually, probably everything on a vert ramp could be "a vertical" to non-skaters.
That Hasan dude is the antithesis of funny
14:16 The artist, not so much. The accent, especially feminine... 😁
Patton Oswalt is never funny
Clearly i need to become mic jagger cus i already am That honest but people just can’t handle it (authism now rock star later then haha 😂)
Im sad the crowd didnt know who Glenn Howerton was.
Chapelle is a transphobe weirdo
5:34 😂😂😂😂
0:53  lmao  old farts
Very true
dam everybody is bad compare to dave😂
The only thing funny about Kevin Hart is the fact that anyone thinks he's funny.
More compilations, less Ch*pelle
Star studded vid...the irony
3:02 4;06 Why did the audience instantly bust out laughing when Neal Brennan called the head of Netflix a "great man?"  What do they know that I apparently do not?
Chris rock's statement would have been more accurate if he would have shouted out "and aziz ansari"
See the guy with the glasses...fo...Leo is the big target because he never wrote the environmental piece...I did
Dave is so funny, but it is not that funny as I would like
Trevor Noah sucks so hard
I've been to that Bananas comedy club! I met Dave Coulter and TJ Miller there!
How sad when he says the owner of Netflix's name,and says he's a good person and the entire crowd laughs at that!? Wow. They all have to use Netflix, but they all know Netflix and its owner are p.o.s. and you got Pete pretty mucj saying, ya us celebs tend to stick together. We hang together even though we don't really care to.
Hasan's Bloomberg impression
Great clips =)
Any one know which Chappelle special feautures this bit? Greets!
This is the best 15mnts of straight laughter I've ever had!  This compilation is brilliant!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dave whispering: "I was furious." will NEVER not be funny
Original video from the onion Over a decade ago  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ-T3i8Ap3U
"You just Jack Chan'd yourself into EVEN MORE coolnes!!!" That's one of my favorite lines ever!! 🤣🤣🤣
If you've ever wondered how Hollywood sells mediocre talent, this is a prime example.  By including Pete Davidson they imply he is at or near the same creative level as other comedians. A big dish of funny with one turd.
ai make a movie
I love how Mr. Pat claps back at Ted Cruz he be roasting his ass lol 😂😂😂
Trevor Noah sucks!
They are all severely overpaid tools of our entertainment and nothing more. Court jesters if you will.
I wish me being the dumbest person in the world would make me billions of dollars
1:20 our golden god definitely  doing extra 😂
The best. Ty
I wish chris destefano wasnt aick becayae it killed his bits. Super distracting😊.
The stuff with Dave’s son is even funnier if you remember Chappelle’s show. Dave featured him in a couple sketches, and both of them involved his son telling Dave how hilarious he thought another comedian was (Nick Cannon if I’m not mistaken)
Aye Bon Jovi💀
Why is Pete Davidson the first person on this list? He's literally the least funnest person in the clip
Wtf is Glenn howerton?
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trevor is rhe absolute worst
2:34 that much red around the eyes even makeup cant cover it... doing stand up, sitting down.... the "chewing" at his own lips getting in the way.... loss of muscle mass.... sorry bro, but you got the HIV....
Y don't u name them in order of appearance ?
Who's the one in the suit ?
Oh Trevor to bad you didn’t know how horrible Obama was he mass murdered woman and children
Patton Oswalt is always hilarious.
"Nawt funnnnyyyy!" is absolutely on point. Need a refund for the last 10 minutes
Doesn’t Chappelle hate autistic and trans people?
DiStefano’sdad should have picked somebody else to mistake Tyler for, Bon Jovi would have known better. 😉  I ove Mulaney.  I’m still half convinced though, that he and the British comedian Jack Whitehall are really the same guy, with an uncanny talent for accents and and f*ckton of frequent flyer miles. 😉
What I got from this is "Don't go in the snow." Dually noted, signed sealed delivered, not gonna do it.
John's right.  I mean I can probably count on one hand the number of times a British billionaire in leather pants has told me to my face that I'm not funny.  Not gonna lie, it stings.
Bunch of great comedians and great bits and they throw in ONE guy whining about trump… why?
Dave Chappelle you make me so fuckin happy ❤
"..a British billionaire going 'Not funnnny'.."   ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
trevor noah didn't belong in here.
Dave's tickets were £300 in London, he cant complain about Kevin's.
Very enjoyable
Their really aren’t any good Indian comedians except russel , also most comedians with glasses just suck
"Famous people are weird as shit" also them: *are famous people*  make it make sense!! cuz the math is not mathing here
Patton Oswald and Pete Davidson are considered to be comedians?
Not a fan of Patton Oswalt sorry
Lol these are famous people telling stories about other famous people.  Lets stop telling ourselves these are just average folk telling stories of weird celebs.  I think the meaning of Netflix is a joke is becoming less than a joke and more just a description.
As a white 34 year old from Australia who laughed my arse off at Dave Chappelles show in my teens and found Kevin Hart funny as a side character in random movies it's funny to me that Dave Chappelles son loves Kevin Hart so much.. He's good in small movie roles.. As a comedian he is an ant compared to Dave's godliness.
Trevor not funny
*kathy griffin has better celeb stories though*
"Trevor that's not true...I've met trump" 🤣
Had to Google who Glenn howerton was 😅
Trevor Noah is a comedian?
Chapelle talking about Kevin Hart is funnier than Kevin Hart
...Trevor though🤣🤣
It's Weird You Don't Know
I can't believe they put Petes name before Dave chappelle
Not really interactions since there's no conversation in these stories and mostly dull.
We want to be comedians, reply to see a video of funny stuff. We also do EPIC FAIL
I broke my ankle playing hopscotch with my son. Yea... I did that. Everyone that worked at the hospital was laughing.
Haha I was waiting for that Mick Jagger bit to resurface again. Classic Mulaney.
famous people on famous people !?  ok
great 3 comedians to put in a thumbnail about celebrities being weird as shit
Trevor is pathetic
Your a write make it cheap cheap
What movie I said no to giving u weed
No
Hey jack black do u regret it
I can tell you Andy Griffith was the polar opposite of Sheriff Andy Taylor. Hunter S. Thompson was jealous of the bad craziness in Manteo, NC. at the Griffith Estate....
I didn't laugh once
I was scrolling down looking for someone to say that Trevor Noah is funny, I didn't find it.
Dude Pete Davidson is not funny
Dan Van Kirk is funnier than any of these people besides Mulaney and Chapelle.
Pete Davidson is whack.  I think he gets so much attention for the fact that his father was a New York fire fighter who died during 9/11.  He is not a good actor and his stand up needs a lot of flippin' work.  His quirky status as a neo-9/11 sympathy-extorting hybrid who portrays himself as a comedian/ actor/ hot chick defiler has created more questions than logical answers in ANY  CAPACITY.
Is it just me or is Hassan Minaj getting incredibly annoying by the minute?
Yeah, can I get that with no Patton Oswalt please?
Hearing these stories just shows how weird hollyweird is 😂😂
8:02 he is a GOD
These comedians are famous also. Does that mean the comedians are weird as s*** also?
This SUCKS harder than my ex girlfriend.
And this is why I don't know the acts of these people, those who I know in the video, I don't watch. Nothing, wow
Mulaney tells a story before getting name dropped in a different story
Who’s Glenn howerton?
This video really illustrates how much better Chapelle is at standup than the majority.
Trevor Noah is NOT funny...
Aubrey Plaza is pretty weird but in a good way...
Who believes Chapelle’s SON was able to get front row seats for $250?? 😂😂 (Quick call to Kev’s manager and he’d be comped front row)
Please don't ever put Pete Davidson's name in front of Dave Chappelle's name.
One of the comedians clearly voices a character in the netflix show Big Mouth
I love when people from CA name drop celebrities like it's a currency that you can spend to make you more popular to the laymen. I believe it's called a starfu**er
No women?!
Netflix  is a JOKE
Homie mentioned Trevor Noah as a great... Already love him
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is Trevor Noah so bad with his delivery? Even with decent material it just comes across horrible.
Famous people turn weird.  And, AI predictive text is a fucking joke!   They can't win here.   They are fucking  idiots!
You don't have to be a celebrity to get weird. Most people that have any large amount of money get weird. I'm sure there's a study done on it somewhere but if you look at every single person that gains money they turn into different people. Part of it is that they are so disconnected from the rest of the people in the United States. They forget what it's like to live day to day for some reason they assume everybody lives the way they do and have the same problems do I take the private jet or not oh I am so torn I don't know what to do. Just saying look at anybody with money they're automatically weird.
8:02 is what we all came here for
Netflix name dropping in the title.
Chappell is good, real  and smart. He is a gift. IMO if you think he is racsist then I disagree. He is a comedian. If yo u don’t like him then don’t watch. Simple.
Fuck this woke comedian
Kevin Hart IS NOT funny. But My daughter dies  of laughter cause of him. Lol
uno obama really said "that's not true i know biden"
"and since that night, horrible things have happened to me and Chris" - Pete Davidson. Pete, do you mean horrible things like you breaking up a marriage and taunting the man whose wife you ripped away from him and then dropped within 6 months?
What is the common theme of these chosen stories.......hmmmm I wonder 🤔
He ratted and threw Dave Chapelle under the bus.F this dude.  😂I’m a new comic. Watch my Comic Bombs set and lmk what u think.
My God, Trevor Noah is the worst. Absolutely nothing he says is funny. It's just regurgitated DNC talking points. I feel dumber having watched his horrid attempt at comedy.
Trevor Noah with the only predictable joke in here...
I still can't grasp why people think Davidson is funny
Wow Trevor Noah to ruin this compilation and of course it was bad joke as expected.
9:56 no one recognized your sorry az because you ain't the real Dave. Dave died in Africa. You're an imposter and a 💩y one at that. #FakeAzDave
This just goes to show how men get prioritized to be invited into rooms with A-list celebs
The Kevin hart bit is the only funny one from all of Chappelle's specials
Hasan Minhaj is absolutely not funny.
Boy I'll say famous people are weird as shit. Little big mouth is an excellent example.
I’m just sitting here calmly smiling and turn the little quiet laugh through my nose..And then I foolishly take a sip of my coffee right before hearing how Chris Distefano’s addressed Steven Tyler…That’s the one that ends up getting coffee everywhere.
Funny how all the great comedians have self-deprecating senses of humor. And then there's Trevor Noah... who can only make a joke at somebody else's expense. And not just anybody, but the most obvious, easy, overused, warn out, has been, target. There is no limit to the depths of his lameness.
Mulaney was the funniest
Booooo
Pete Davidson doesn't belong in the same picture as those legends. He isn't funny.
they should NEVER have cancelled hasan minaj's weekly show on netflix. real eye opening. it was like when jon stewart was on the daily show
Loved this but Trevor Noah is a sell out. Very disappointing😔 as a south african he unfortunately lost a fan when he went all out woke😔
Ppl nowadays are  so touchy,just laught at the  jokes  or don't,but most of y'all  need the laughter clearly  your lives sock😅😅😅
It’s funny how trump is more popular snd funnier than Obama
I don’t know about that Patton Oswald bit, I have a really hard time believing he’s not super athletic. Lol.
Chappelle is the only one who made me laugh. Sad
Oswald would make a perfect Leisure Suit Larry movie.
Hey Netflix, quit forcing everyone to slip “Netflix” into  their act — it’s desperate as hell.
Lame
That davidson guy is so much fun. I laugh alot.
Anybody but Trevor. Dude blows.
I only laughed when Dave Chapelle came on
I want to be a homeless person in Dave's neighborhood. I want him to kick me in the f****** face when I ask for change.
Hasan Oswalt and Brennan are seriously unfunny
Hasan saying "and then she left the room" it's so relatable
Trevor sucks so bad. Not funny at all. Has nothing to do with Trump. He's just not funny.
Hey Chris Stephano, we all felt our dad's were the coolest but we didn't make our entire career embellishing the issue
Why would anybody want to watch an ugly corpse that's not funny like Pete Davidson
Dave is King, god damn it!
There is just to many weird shady things that go on in this world
FF thru Trevor. He's never been funny.
Famous people talking about how famous people are weird
Ironic Patton Oswalt is featured in a video titles Famous People are Weird. Have you seen his tweets?
Of course Trevor Noah was the lamest, only one political joke, you could see coming a mile away with the setup "I must be the dumbest person you've met [Pres Obama]"
The 1st guy listens to Kanye West! Bit the shyt out of his lines
Patton is a woketard pos.
Dave Chappelle is the goat
Neil Brennen 😂😂😂Chis Rock is a killer!!
I love watching celebrities talk about celebrities
Trevor Noah definitely should never ever die in a fire.  I would be heartbroken.
I love when famous people make fun of the concept of famous people
Mulaney is easily in the top 10 funniest comedians alive
It was great to see so many funny comedians and Trevor Noah.
I didn't know Andrew Globerman told jokes. 😲
When you name drop cunts, that's not a brag. Just fyi  Edit: yeah I'm talking to you Noah and Silverman. Try not to suck a dick on your way to the parking lot, whores.
Was that just Patton Oswald name dropping Glenn Howerton? Wasn't Patton famous for years before anyone even knew who Howerton was? And isn't he (Howerton) only famous for one thing, it's always sunny? Isn't name dropping a mid-level celebrity a little self-deprecating? Is there any possibility for Patton Oswald to become any more beta than he always already was?
and Neal Brennan 💔
We've been to see a lot of comedians, including 4 or 5  where they were recording for a special, but something happened at the Kevin Hart show we've not experienced anywhere else. Before it started, they had us all fake laugh and applause a few times for the recording, which we found strange and unnecessary because it really was funny, they definitely could have got plenty of real shots of that. They also threatened us with having our seats filled if we left them for some reason, despite there being huge empty sections right down the front they were apparently not bothered by. Neither of those things have happened at any other show we've been to, it was just weird. Good show tho. Neal Breenan is good live too. Believe it or not, Dave Chappelle was actually the worst show we've been to, not because of the sets tho, him and Jon Stewart were great that night, but because there were huge gaps between sets (and there were like half dozen support acts), it really dragged, but we couldn't tell how long because they'd locked up our watches as well as our phones. We were also grumpy because we hadn't been able to find food anywhere near the venue, tho of course that's nothing to do with the show.
Dave is such a good storyteller
🔥😂
I can’t stand Patton oswalt
Please don’t put a clip of Trevor Noah in with comedians that are funny. It ruins the mood.
People really likes pete material?
Chris' father is the best! Dave's son is hilarious!
I thought it was comedians what was Trevor Noah doing on there
Someone just has to be political. F-- him. Everyone else was great, but my favorite was the guy's dad telling Steven Tyler not to blot his pizza. And calls him Bono. 🤣🤣🤣
Who gives a crap you gnome?
Do you do private consultation?
i don’t like patton after he went after chappelle
Trever Noah is an unfunny looser.
That was very enjoyable EXCEPT Trevor Noah! That man never has been,  is currently not & never will be funny👎 No matter what he is talking about.
Am I the only one that thinks Neil Brennan isn't funny?
Chris Destefano tells the same joke twice with minor variations.
Thank goodness for comedy.
Trump joke by Noah killed it for me, and not in a good way
Chappelle’s depiction of his son is so perfect
Hurt. I was napkin blotting the oil off of a slice of cheese and pepperoni in my van watching this at lunch. I just balled up the napkins and tossed them in my trash bag when that bit started. I prefer not to have orange oil running down my shirt. I prefer the  crust not get soggy with it. I may be a dirty construction worker but I am not a savage. With pizza at least. That is all.  I'm off to piss in a jug.  Maybe I am a savage.
Patton Oswald the leftist "who cares about logic" hahahah so on point
But Chris knew your name man
Dave's story is still hilarious.
Not even funny
I loved Blocks it’s a must watch
Literally I only laughed at Dave’s material. 😂😂 that’s why he’s the best!
“and Neal Brennan” 😂😂😭😭😭🙌🏽
Not Funny !!
Trevor Noah is not a comedian. Comedians are funny and tell jokes.
Patton Oswalt is a scumbag and doesn't deserve to be in a set of clips that also has Chappelle in it.
The title of this video is the most interesting things I've seen online in a while
That's ironic considering how dumb Noah is and who Trump is. Weird to call someone who's spent his whole life successful and before he became president beloved by most, dumber than the unfunny guy who spreads propaganda for a living.
I got news for you - ALL people are weird as SHT - you just never hear about them!
I never laughed holy fuck 😐
trevor with a trump joke , such a good set up for a lame punch  that said not a fan of any president just hate how hard he rode that train
Dave Chappelle having a badge for his old show as part of his onstage dress greens is such a baller f*ckin flex.
Netflix chose the weakest clip from Trevor  come on man..
who is trevor noah? never heard of him before.
Dave manages to come away from any story with incredible humility. I doubt that he has ever measured his success by the checks that have been waved in front of him.
Chappelle is so funny.
Patton: "I am going to drop a name here....Glen Howerton! " Me: Who? ...You are not good at this name dropping thing, are you? "
Pete Davidson is not a comedian. He's barely an actor; he played in a movie about him, and he played himself. Not much acting was needed so....
I love Chappell!
Me saying "that's funny" at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So snow boarding amd skateboarding accidents make you weird?
Kevin Hart is NOT funny. I don't know why people like him.
Neal is such an underrated comedian. Blocks is a masterpiece.
Could've left out Pete would've been perfect
Dave Chappelle is the funniest man on the planet hands down.
Is Mick Jagger circumcised?
If Obama could say Trump the dumbest person he ever met. Obviously blatantly ignoring Joe Biden. Trump could and did run a country very well! Joe Biden is completely destroying every good thing about America. #FJB
As always Trevor Noah…..😐
Somebody explain Pete's joke pls
Now would you say celebrities we have an inside or s*** did everybody don't know about
Dave Chappelle always kill it
You lost me on pedo patton, bye!
Funny! Thank you.
This was awful
Trevor Noah had to ruin this reel
12:52 don’t ever go to thay holiday inn 🤮
Both are excellent but different  Didn't know we had to choose.
Is it just me or were all these jokes cut off too early
"Pete Davidson" - hard pass, putting that no talent "comic" in there
Sure hope Netflix stays woke, so Netflix can go broke.
This is shit
Without Jesus➡John 3:36.
Dave Chappelle just does it like no one else.
2:35 wtf happened with Ari Shafir?!!
Wait, Trevor Noah is a comedian 😒
I Throw Comical Jokes At This Stuff Too,  Even Ones At American Politics Today,  But My Jokes Aren't TV Worthy, Because  My Jokes Don't Laugh With Viewers,  My Jokes Laugh At People Instead, oO   I Mean Lets Be Honest? If You Can't Find Something To Laugh About In America Today, You Gotta Have Some Kind Of Mental Problem,  Or Your Just Brain Dead, oO   Cause Even Other Countries Find America  To Be The Biggest Joke Of The Century...
Steven Tyler got fucking humbled ☠️
Patton Oswalt is the worst person to ever live.
F Kevin ❤
Please put the riddacuo The harassment I'm making fun of me Please set my life
These compilations are better than cable television
Trevor noah was not even funny
Man I was watching Dave Chappelle and then it cut to Trevor Noah, it was like a train crashed. I instantly paused the video, left this comment and closed the video. Going from one of the greats to a completely unfunny 'comedian', who edited this?!
Why is Pete’s name first.
Trevor Noah not funny
Armpeet Davidson is a degenerate scumbag Im not watching the video, paused at 2 sec.

Trevor Noah…so funny!! How’s your late night show??
Chapelle telling a story like this shows how humble he is.... He is without a doubt one of the goat in comedy but he is so modest....
Except for Noah this was pretty funny
Did Trevor Noah leave office with Trump ?, what a hack, go back to your shitty Country and make fun of your war torn poverty stricken nation
Pete sounds like James Woods.
trevor noah has never made anyone with an iq of over 60 laugh
To patton oswald: dennis reynolds is a golden god and so is glenn howerton.
Pete is completely insufferable. How did that guy get famous whining about how pathetic he is.
I love listening to compilations like these😄 Thank you!
I hope they don’t recycle that same Chapelle and Hart encounter with his son 😂 they love showing that one
Comedians (and Pete Davidson)
Fuck Patton. Calaims a 20 year friendship and then apologizes for taking a picture with Chapelle. Fuck you.
I have to give propst when due, chris rock's "and Neil Brenner " comment was hilarious
Not funny!
why cut the dave chappelle bit? there was more to the story
That Trevor bit was the worst of the bunch. Mainly because I knew he was going to say Trump at the end. This dude is so predictable.
Trevor Noah is as funny as broccoli. And more irritating
Pete Davidson is a comedian?
Netflix is a joke, for putting Pete before Dave in the title
I really liked Neal’s special
Im astonish Husan is still alive after saying all that out-loud! lol Guess he once again outted the Saudis! haha
You cut out the beginning of Trevor Noah’s joke.
I can't wait to never meet Trevor Noah.
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!! Despite the economic downturn, I'm so happy 😊I have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $9,000 investment every 21days.
Oswald sure sucked a lot of pickles to be called a comedian.... What a turd
Oh back when Mulaney was put together
Hasan and Patton ain’t funny.
Maybe the only video in history where Pete Davidson is credited before Dave Chappelle
I want to meet DiStefano's dad SO BAD.
"...never to your face does a British billionaire in leather pants go, 'Not funny!'" Has John Mulaney never heard of Simon Cowell?
IS THAT ANDREW GLOBBERMAN?
Thanks for the Chapelle clip, it helped the Pete clip go down more easily.
Useless.
Mulaney's bit on Mick Jagger 😅😅😅
Well, guess that's it for this sub. I'm not supporting y'all if you're giving a platform to people like this. Kanye West loving, Elon Musk friending conkwocket.
6:35 napkin-blotting the oil off your pizza IS pretty egregious 🤷🏽‍♀️😂
Yes they are
chappelle is an artist
Going to be fun to see these people sud denly die LOL
Chappelle’s bit is hilarious lmao
Kanye is telling the truth about alot of stuff.He might have a couple of mental issues but HE'S NOT CRAZY!!
wth
WHERE IS KANYE WEST
