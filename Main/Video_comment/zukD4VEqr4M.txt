The ultras in Europe look like cowardly terrorists with their masks on. I prefer the English fans.
Little game of football,, I don't get it the game is crap , trump for England
Fans falling out over absolutely nothing again because they've had a few beers on an away day Football fans are not hard And its not a competition whose the hardest You're paying to watch a load of millionaires run round a field They'll be in the dressing room while your on the terraces fighting for a team they dont care about as much as you do Time to wake up
It’s the absolute golden rule not to attack normal fans or families. They got dealt with by a few elderly West Ham boys. The Dutch are at very best forever living in the shadow of English firms..
strange when english hooligans get a taste of their own medicine
you will never see this at a rugby game
📢WHO ARE YA WHO ARE YA📢
Cowardly Dutch against children and families, as always.......
Stupid football customers
The security is non existent. Shameful and embarrassing
Funny how West Ham fans always get "attacked."
Alot of respect for az but leave families out of it
To much Milk from Mum
GSE IS REAL 😂
Y’all take soccer Way Serious! 😜
Dutch 🤢
Alkmaar pussies in masks.
Top fighters west ham from a manu fan
Chicky in London, but too scared to come to Warsaw
Seems everyone wants a go at the English,  your 40 years to late you tobys
Most civilized football fan
Tottenham Arsenal Chelsea and 👶💩⚒️
It was Duch planned aggression against players and fun’s!. I hate Duch people since then!!. You are liers , racists & bandits!. 🤮🤬💩
The hammers had the Dutch courage boys on the run.
Alkamar best stick to making cheese. They can’t fight that’s for sure.
Nothing new, they did similar thing to Legia W fans and yet had got away with it, What a bunch of losers az A are
Holland gays against UK women and children
England fans scum bag 😅😅
0.06  Declan Rice throws a bottle towards the crowd. Now I know why he wanted to leave the Hammers.
Little Dutch girls bit off more than they could chew, trying to take on the West Ham fans ! 😂Pathetic lads !
W Polsce solidaryzujemy się z piłkarzami West Ham.
Brawo West Ham Kurwy z alkmar)
West Ham Alkmar gej kurwy
Dutch pedals bhuhuhuha no holigans but funny pedals
It's a pity that the city is ruled by xenophobia and brutality
https://youtu.be/nCO8JhMYa6w?si=If9dSSs0Y4cSoqtE
Dutch racist van Alkmaar attack rest of Europe...
They weren't Dutch supporters. They were dressed in hoodies, snoods and clavas...so they were they to cause a riot intentionally. They look like Antifa but no idea if that's who they were.
Jebać holenderskie ścierwa - pozdrowienia dla WHU👍👍👍
Animals from Alkmaar, xenophobic and racists, as we are hated by everyone, their slogan surely is we are afraid of everyone, all beyond Alkmar must be so mysterious for them. If it happened in Poland, we would be banned from European games for decades...
West Ham then, Legia now. Savages.
The Dutch suckled Nazism with their mother's milk
*puts the current, October 2023, situation with LEGIA WARSAW in perspective, doesn't it?*
UEFA !!! Why is Alkmaar still playing in the competition? WHU and now Legia is not enough?
Alkmar is a racist place. Attacking children, mothers and standing behind police guard.... AVOID ALKMAAR AND HOLLAND..
Little Alkmaar wankers...come to Warszawa....We are waiting for you...
dutch Nazi scumbags without honor and rule of law! Stink and pathology, the netherlands has always been like this, human rights are not respected in the netherlands , only racists and Nazis live there,
Alkmaar is a s##thole
Come on you irons, don't be afraid! ⚒️⚒️⚒️
Is Reiinders really strong player?
Haha😅
Isso é Paquetá! I🔥🇧🇷
Telegraph don't want to show what a real man looks like, defending families, women and children.
Maleducazione tipica olandese, solo scena e zero fatti
Can you imagine if those ultras had tried it on against the West Ham firm of the 70s and 80s.  They got kicked to sh8t by an old geezer with a dodgy hip😂😂😂
Rangers fan here. Hope the hammers win the cup next week; met a few of you guys in Seville last year at the final. Good bunch of lads. Up the hammers!
Dutch are idiots
Look at all them drunken idiots. This is why I don’t go anywhere in this world I don’t take a city bus I don’t take Uber I don’t fly on planes and I stay in my home the world has become too evil do you enjoy anything in this world I even order my groceries online😮 I don’t go anywhere‘s and I certainly won’t drive not with all of these horrible Road rage people on the road they can have it😮
If it had been The Hammers  causing the bother then the coppers would have attacked them 100% ,but they did nothing, naff all,shame on them 🦉💙⚒🇬🇧🤝
They Don’t even know how to fight 😂
Paqueta 🤣
Da ultrà Napoli solo rispetto per questo tifoso 😊
Hooded pussies. If you're gonna do something atleast have the balls to deal with the consequences. Cowards.
Where is the police??????
Need to stop those ultra that disgracing the game. Even AZ players were wanting to stop the mayhem
Football is patriotism and  patriotism is the  virtue of the vicious
AZ Alkmaar.....watch your backs Ultra scum........you got fuckin' HAMMERED!!
bloody discracefull .  take my hat off to the chaps thatn got stuck in .. just wish westham fans could have got inthere to help.
"I'm forever blowing bubbles" 🎶🎵⚒️
az alkmaar, THE SHAME OF EUROPE
Wheres your famous ICF??? 😅😅😅😅
Disgusting hooligans..if u upset..show your anger at your club..not their opponent..
Y se supone eso es el 1er mundo
Remember “Moroccans” rioting in some European countries. When those Moroccans are 2nd/3th gen, born, raised European. Where are all the racists now huh?
Well done, they protected West Ham scum..not families
Those duch dummies 😂 sissies thinks wearing cagoules makes them strong and scary I swear that I can f**k each of them one by one in 10 second max for each
This is what happened when a group of so called hard Russians ran into an end full of family supporters and started punching non-hooligan English supporters. The Dutch have tried something very similar here with my beloved football club. It's so easy to get caught up in the past history of West Hams firm and say if this was 45 years ago this wouldn't have happened but, it has and this is what happens when you have a reputation from days gone by.  You've only got ask our friends in South Bermondsey about that they are still paying for their past, it is what is you just have to live with it. God bless and be safe.
These ultras are in every European Club, only interested in trouble, not football and UEFA do nothing.  I watch Chania fc in the Greek Super-league 2 and those ultras spit on the opposing teams dugout and the Police stand by and do nothing, it’s a disgrace, if it was in the U.K. we would all be banned.  Unless action is taken it will get worse.  It’s ultras not normal fans
A good old Dutch vs English shuffle.
Why were no arrests made by the police? That club should be banned from European football, and a huge fine imposed. If UEFA penalise WHU and any of their staff, then they have no common sense at all. I am not a West Ham fan, but applaud their actions in consideration of their families and friends.
well done to the west ham dad fans who held of the Dutch protecting the families brave guys fair play
Millwall fans would have handled them
Very unfriendly, but the same happened in London. Don't forget that
No arrests!!! What a joke
That's an old school beating ! No masks, no weapon , no dresses. Good 4u grandpa! 🇬🇷☘️
This Made me like Declan rice lol
Green street holigans was here.
Will the Dutch get a decade ban for this ?
Az pussy s cant fight
Wegen nem Ballsport 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️viele dieser Ultras sind so Ehrenlos!!! Jeder der an solch Aktionen mitwirkt, sollte auf Lebenszeit Stadionverbot bekommen! Bas#*rde!!! 🤬
How is it in a stadium full of stewards it falls to the players to try to intervene and a couple of West Ham fans to prevent the mob from doing what they clearly intended. Dutch policing effort ? Don’t make me laugh.
The dutch just found out that england are the OGs of football violence
Don’t F@ck  with West Ham fans ….respect from a Liverpool native
""3 old West Ham fans were deployed to restore order""
Weakest punch up the worlds ever seen
No arrests? the porn loving dutch stoner cops are such pussies.....the folk who abandoned the Bosnian Muslims to the slaughtered by Serbian thugs at Srebrenica, the same folk whose civil service and cops collaborated to kill 84% of Dutch Jews, a higher percentage than anywhere is Western Europe....
Bloody Hooligan bastards! what does it actually take to make you see it's you guys destroying the sports we all claim to love. Piss off our stadiums!
AZ scum made themselves look like a bunch of flannels
People gotta be fucked to mess with Iron
Had that been in England West Ham would be fined and banned
Che pagliacci 🤡 Respect West Ham
Well done Knollsey proper ⚒️🤣👏👏😘
Hahaha AZ pussies lost against one West Ham Bloke on the stairs 😆👌
PS: This is about a few AZ Hooligans (not fans) who only want to rell. So please do not think every AZ fan, Alkmaarder or Dutch person is like those filthy hooligans.  Thanks for appreciating❤ and greetings from Alkmaar
If that was English fans their would be a ban and fine. Notice the little cowards didn't  show up at West Ham.
Why is this video called West Ham players defend their families’??? All I see is a couple of players running around waving their arms about. It should be called ‘West Ham FANS defend West Ham players families’!!! Why has British journalism sunk to such misleading and inaccurate reporting? Did you even watch this before you stole it and added your logo?
Imagine 5 Knollsies being there. They would send all those AZ pussies directly to the hospital 😂
And this is why I don’t watch football. It just turns everyone into apes!
Picked there mark didn't they? Can you imagine trying that against the old ICF? well done Hammers - now go and win the thing. Everton fan.
I don’t get it.
I have said this for ages... the security staff at football games are rendered useless!    Its mostly wee boys n girls with no life experience and on minimum wage!    We have all heard the saying "you get what you pay for"? Well this is an example of that!    British stadiums are the same inadequate level. It shows a presence but when it comes to actual security they are as much use as tits on a fish! 🐟    Respect to the two West Ham boys! 💪
Un saluto a mio fratello west Ham lazio
Sorry what am I watching?
Az fans getting beat up by old men hahahaha. Your lucky you didn't attack the main fans instead of family members and old men
Well done lads.
Hero❤
Respect....Millwall fans
Hahahah come to Serbia to see what the fight is all about😂
Ssince this happened in sick degenerate western europe, no punishment from uefa mafia excpected.
Tbh i seen hs basketball games fights.that are way better than this 😂😂😂
I’ve just seen this and my first thought is that Az Alkmaar fans suck, and I know nothing about football and live in Australia. All you ‘Ultras’ should get a life.
Who do they think they are wearing matching black hoodies like they’re the teenage mutant ninja hooligans
Where ever English go they just don't have any respect for the country they land in.
No English hooligans this time but Dutch hooligans the English disease is spreading greetings from America.
Wouldn't call that defending but okay.
Netherlands is not a safe country and people there are unbearable.. GENERALLY SPEAKING
The Dutch police are at fault here by even allowing pyrotechnics into the stadium and then sitting idle instead of reacting instantly
Vergogna.....
Apologies are not enough. Identify the attackers, take them to court and implement capital punishment. Then, this will never happen again. These people were trying to attack families and would kill someone if they had a chance to do it. They cannot be rehabilitated.
West Ham had jone jones wtf  https://youtu.be/zukD4VEqr4M?t=54
MERDA💩
As a Dutch man …. A shame what the fans AZ did  Also a shame to the Netherlands
The day two old guys smashed all az ultras
Respect for the english .  From ultras inter .. dutch pussy there
Why this vid don't show fights trainstation and city centre?,WHU run run 😅
Ha ha they got destroyed in there own backyard, by a few English men 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤣
West Ham and Trouble NEVER
“Congratulations, You Have Just Met the I.C.F.” One ("big old oì-boy Knollsy) against hundreds of keyboard-AZ-"hooly"....Who won? Oiiii, my boy! I.C.F. 4ever
This goes to show that a country funded by drugs and whores raise sons of drug addicts and well .. whores. New low from the lowest of all. Too bad they did not show any spirit when it comes down to being sore losers. Also the "police", was more like taking part rather than preventing it. Still, can't ask more from sons of low life mentality.
The Major!
What pussy boys going for the families, well done for the men, proper men who stood up. How embarrassing for them altras lol
Depois os europeus querem falar que são civilizados em relação aos torcedores sul americanos. Hipócritas
In rome fayenoord "hooligans" have attacked bernini fountain. (Even nazi didnt touch monument in rome during ww2 ) now az "hooligans" attacks wast ham families and get beaten by 2 old man.. dutch dont have ultras/hooligans mentality.
Wow that must of been so scary for the kids the women and the men involved in these scenes  but from wot my eyes can see them them west ham oldies stood there ground big time and them other thugs I think didn't expect that don't  back in the day fans protected each other gr8 stuff west ham I hate violence its just like crime dead end street its not just that there could be a mother and father without a family member now , anyway good luck for the final guys godbless , from a Liverpool fan, YNWA,
To English fans wondering where Alkmaar is, we don’t know either… they seem to always run away when the other team arrives… greetings from Rotterdam ✌️
Dutch fans are crazy
I saw this from another angle and saw a particular big guy at the top of the stairs taking on the thugs himself.  It was pretty impressive.  I hope he and those next to him get some recognition for their bravery. Its sad they had to experience that.
Utter shocking ! Its bad enough when the mob are attacking other mobs , despicable when they target players but this is the lowest yet attacking players families ?  Come on I know none will change the result but while I have experienced the first two experiences this is rather dire in a new low in behaviour. Lets hope this was a one off.
Idiote navijacki  nemoj psovati boga Nek te je stid i sram.
Well done to the stewards who managed to keep the players away from their families.
I kinda know West Ham, but never heard of AZ Alkmaar - sounds like a literacy club, for people who cant read good and stuff. Come learn your A-Z here guys. Thick dutchmen would probably fail anyway.
Security making sure they themselves don’t get hurt , well done Security next time we need security for children’s parties will give yous a call make sure to wear your body armour
good old fight no one injured
AZ Alcoholic fans are crazy.
Dutch Wankers
What actually happened and why?  Came on to see video after seeing that man called Knollsy helped alot of people. Thanks?x
Relegate that dogshit club…
Family😂😂 some topguys from earlier were in the stands next to the family provoking and hanging west ham banner. That should never be tolerated jn the away stadium.
Full grown men in balaclavas at football, embarrassing
Stommeeeee hollanders jullie stinkeeeeen
barbari vs barbari
The police blatantly turned a blind eye they even came from the same area as their so called ultras. If they had anything about there selves should of took em to the other end where they would of met their doom. So sad for the women children who had to witness and experience this cowardly aggressive act. Nod to the men who stood and protected the vulnerable 👏🏼🙌🏼⚒
Congratulations!! You have just met the ICF⚒
Disgraceful display
Az attacking family and children pathetic
The stewards did nothing to stop the wannabe thugs; but they sure did want to carry on with the west ham players. Where were the police?
What's the point paying the 'security' if there just gonna stand there and watch😂😂
Respect for the two West Ham blokes 💪
Same thing happend to az in london this was just retaliation
AZ stewards were fecking useless!  I could see some of them pushing the West Ham players back whilst the hooligans were attempting to beat the West Ham fans!  Geez, I think these AZ stewards were on the hooligans' side.....
Dutch Ultras out here throwing bicycles.
Disgusting and inexcusable from the security/stewards, probabaly paid off by those clown ultras. Glad to see they got beat twice in a night. Rest easy angel of alkmaar, someone get that guy to the final.
No arrests were made ???? Wtf !?
And there are the Dutch "Ultras"...18 year old kids who "bravely" cover their faces with hoods! Who probably would stoop as low to attack women and kids. Utter novices and a joke! The English firms of the 80s would have - literally - had them for breakfast LOL!
The dutch looking like right cunts.... Useless fooking muppets.  A 59 yr old and another one just slapped the faces of them  perfume wearing geebags .
If anyone ever deserved a thorough beating, it is these lot. Not supporting the actions of the AZ mob but West Ham hooligans have been causing trouble in literally every ground in England for the last 30 years so its hard to feel sorry for them.
Handbags!
Imagine acting like this because you're upset over other men playing a sport you have nothing to do with, except that by chance you were just born in the same town they play for.
Dutch filth! It’s coming home! Get in there Hammers!
AZ Ultras made mugs out of themselves...with a bit of luck will be drawn against West Ham in Europa League Group Stage next season...
Bunch of scummy, hood wearing chavs versus proper legends defending their families. No contest.  Literally..... Men vs boys.  Expect nothing from UEFA though..   They're as toothless as they are corrupt. Has there even been a COMMENT from UEFA ?
AZ Alkmaar Ultras 0 West Ham United Granddads 2
Bullshit headline...one bloke who definitely isn't a player stood up for the lot of them properly
Liverpool fan here well done west ham but I don't think all these hooligan movies are doing your club much good the European fans want to take you on
Cause they are without Lazio fans
The Dutch are a weak cuck nation.
Little mugs in black would get folded up.
Wouldn’t happen in rugby
Ban them. Arrest them.
Dutch dickheads.
Russia-Ukraine, then this?...
Same thing happened last week. But I guess it isn't convenient for a bri'ish media outlet to acknowledge the fact that this was retaliation 😅 Both those West Ham and AZ hooligans should be brought to justice.
AK fans have no idea what they just started Icf icf icf icf
Wonder what Alf Garnett words would be to this
Shameful and disgusting. Surely there needs to be some sort of repercussions against the idiotic minority.
Stupid crazy people
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRONS
The whole world is laughing at the Dutch, didnt the Netherlands say they wanted to produce propaganda to deter English people from visiting the Netherlands because of how they act yet this is their reaction when getting beaten at football, should be ashamed and a public statement should be issued by the people in charge of the Dutch government
100 AZ Alkmaar ultras are marching towards the WEST HAM fan's, the spotter says, there coming, how many are they, a voice from afar calmly asks, around a 100 maybe more, after some consideration the voice from afar, again calmly says just send 1 to repel there attack, if we need more ?  il go 😭🇬🇧⚒
Rumours are that one of the west ham fans got his cheeks took
AZ Ultra pussies...lol
Knollsy ❤💪💯
realy bad job  form dutch police,
Areola ready to brawl
Marlon Harewood 😝 damn brut of a man 💪
Football..brings out the best and worst in people..
Thats right get back in your hole dutchies !!!!!
grow up.....accept reality and move on
what a bunch of pussies to attack the family stand. go and attack the west ham away supporters if they have the balls, easier to attack a bunch of kids and women isn't it? absolute disgrace and a lack of balls by AZ ultras. very low.
Would you mind to tell that in England the West Ham United " fans" did this first ?   Suspend both clubs for a year would be mine solution
Well done to the West Ham Dad's Army - brave men.  They humiliated the Dutch.
They would want to hope they never have to play West Ham away ever because one of the worse and one of the biggest firms in England not going end well for them AZ fans 😂
Shocking same old ultras.
Totally appalled by the scenes at the end of the match last night but surprised by it;- absolutely not. Whilst I don't condone hooliganism of any sort, we set the rules when our hooligans were running amok, home & abroad, back in the 1970/80s. We passed on the baton, metaphorically speaking, to the Dutch, German, Italian thugs who've continued running with it. I just worry that UEFA will now come down hard on the West Ham players who got involved like Downes, Antonio, Ogbonna etc , who afterall were only going in to protect their families& friends. Hopefully common sense will prevail.
Absolute fannybangles. Grown men all kitted up like they're part of some military regiment, attacking a stand of mainly kids and oldies.  Must make them feel like ten men. I don't know why they don't put that aggression to better use, like going boxing or MMA training. I suppose then they'd take the risk of being exposed as absolute wimps so it kinda makes sense.  If you want to fight, fight v's people of like mind. Whether that's firm v's firm, in a ring, or underground. Attacking innocent bystanders is just the absolute pits and only makes them look the cowards they are. This is true of all hooligans, not just these idiots. Proper mobs used to have a tear up with other mobs, they left the people who weren't there to fight well alone. You're just a coward if you start throwing punches at people who are there purely to watch the game. It's tantamount to bullying, and nobody likes a bully.  If those AZ fans think they're all that, they should organise a meet up with the ICF. They'd sharp see the error of their ways. I'm sure they're aware of this though, hence why they attacked the family and friends corner. Bunch of absolute marshmallows.
Wheres the video of the one guy fighting them all at the top of the stairs, that man deserves a  life long season ticket.... acted like a spartan. From a forest fan! Top guy!!
Ban them. Disgusting that they had to defend their loved ones. Absolute disgrace.
West Ham fans did what they had to as no police arrived till later.
No arrests made...really? I dream the day My team play here...I live here and know how cowardly Dutch fans are..... come on millwall
