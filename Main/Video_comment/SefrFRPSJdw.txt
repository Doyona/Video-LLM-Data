He has a tattoo of never mind, he literally has recreated the pic a few times, and NOW he has an issue with it 🤷‍♀️
still chasing that money huh
Hey can't sue the singer😢
Baby on Bored
Bro was brave to saw the 'cp' in uncensored way
I swear it's his daughter bro
He just wants more money. He only got $200 bucks
No one would know who he was if he kept quiet.
They should just toss him like 50 or 100 grand and call it a day. Maybe have him show up with the surviving members for publicity and pay him a wage.
He's still chasing that dollar...
Tbh i would brag to my friends if i was the nirvana baby
Nirvana won the case and he didn’t get anything
I honestly think he's doing all this for clout
This is what happens when lazy mfs want money 💀
Ungrateful mofo
Only 150K?? Why bother?
Cash grab. He can blame his parents
HE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THE LIL PIECE OF 💩😒😒😒😒😒
Estoy seguro que todavía sigue buscando el billete de dólar aún adulto.
How you gonna sue Kurt cobain if he is dead
he looks like kurt too
NERVANA?? WHAT
I’m gonna sue a dead guy hip hip hooray!!
What does meaning suing kurt cobain died and nirvana was disbanded. maybe he need more money.. what a fool
Oh c'mon🤣
I think he should get some dough.  I mean his horrible parents were horrible, I bet they ran around telling everyone who her son was. Of course people gave him shit about it. I kinda think bullying is a joke, you really can easily bully someone who is being loved too much.
Ooo fuc. that!
No he’s really upset because he never got that dinner with Kurt. But no In all seriousness this guy is a scumbag.
This is 2 year old news
Stupid old news and the case is already settled
What is porn?
He'll make more money on onlyfans than spend it on lawyers.
Idiot,  just bullshit Just a money grab!!!
You just get out of a Mexico prison or did it take you a year to make this video?  And its actually Nirvana, with an I.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Old news
Old news bro
Breaking news, huh?
The oldest news in the music industry. He’s done this several times.
Even as an adult he’s still chasing that dollar
He literally became what the album cover represented. Just a baby chasing money.
He just needs the $$$$$.  Penises don’t equal porn. Lame.
I saw that cup before🥲🥲🥲🥲💀
Pretty sure its a cash grab but I sure af hate that album cover
he sound like a bigger baby than he was on the cover
This case was thrown out over a month ago
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
This lawsuit was dismissed back in January. Little slow on the news with this video.
He's a nobody. No one knows who he is.
Hogwash
He has recreated many times, its not like we would have know who he was if he didn't embrace it.
Typical America...
Anything for $
If he made money from it then there's no way he can sue  they paid him his due he's just getting greedy and want more money And anyway he should be bitching about his parents who allowed that
He should lose because he’s made money off of it. He probably just needs more money for meth
Some people are just sue happy.
Child pornography is not a civil suit, it's a criminal one. Is he seeking to have them all arrested? How about his parents?
child oport sounds wrong so yeah
As a minor, his parents signed away his claim.
yeah he just wants money 🙄😹 he’s not wrong tho
Nah, he ain't  Gonna be winning That game, Not after that.
I feel like that is CP tho
It's America. It's what you do! File ridiculous law suits that wouldn't see a courtroom anywhere else in the world......some of 'em even win too!!
he just wants money and now has found a way to get it, it’s bs
When I saw that at target I was like so that's what a handle looks like and I said that in public 🤣😭
"Nirvana has traumatized me by using my nude baby picture.....so im going to recreate them?"
So that baby was on a Nirvana cover AMD a similar one by a band of a similar name, "Nervana" ?  That can't be a coincidence
"NERVANA"?
Kinda hard to sue dead people
It’s possible that he recreated the pictures because he’s confident in his body and he likes the band. But if he doesn’t like the original cover, he should sue his parents
He's still the same guy in the picture.... fishing for money
Funny finesse move 😂
They should just give him money yearly for the rest of his life just because millions of people have seen his naked baby body to this day. I mean he must not be that hurt if he’s recreating the picture but he’ll get what ya can times are tough !
bro came out as one of the most iconic rock n roll albums of all time and still do this shit
Tell me you are American without telling me you are American.  This guy:
Each band member?
Case was thrown out, old news.
now that's creative ......yeah  nirvana profited from it...i mean they used it as a type of commercialism so he should receive some type of compensation
Man’s tryna sue a dead guy
shame 🤣
Get that check mayn ☠️
Still chasing that dollar huh
Respect to that guy!
It's all about money
I smell b****
Mhm
Nobody even knew who he was he wanted the people to know so he can do something conniving like this think it is nasty and dirty he don't deserve s***
He deserves nothing!! He's a user.
Money hungry and he's looking for attention 😒 🙄
He is reaching, no one would recognise him, so even if he is embarrassed his pp hasn't grown no one would know its him.
He just trying to make money
Lol dude just wants money
No. He's trying to make money.  Who would think this is child p. What has he been watching.   Ones greed tells on Themselves... the poor baby ain't doing nothing but swimming..IN WATER NOT WITH NOBODY ...   He might as well sue light..for lighting him up while he's naked at home...smh...
His bs
I think he's after money. nobody would know its him unless he told them just looking for money instead of working for it
He's appeared on a British quiz show called nevermind the buzzcocks and has stated he's managed to get with a few people because of this.
I think he is an OPPORTUNIST.  And the Court should immediately determine his lawsuit FRIVOLOUS!
Wait isn’t it his foot?
That black dot is a little overextended. In both photos
People talking about he consented to it and that bullshit! It’s literally child porn
I think he's broke
It clearly didn’t cause him trauma.
He will probably lose, but nirvana sucks and Kirt was an ass, so I wish he would win
Literally no one would know who he is unless he tells them.
I think he wants money
His perants  singed him uo for it. If he wNtd to sue any one its his perant. Greedy
If you ever recreated it and have a tat of the band name u can piss off. Even if he didnt recreate it or like the band his parents consented....they signed your rights away for u soooo
He is full of it
Why not just sue them for using his likeness on a cover, it'd be much easier than trying to claim something much more serious
He's just mad, because his g/f told him that his week wee still the same size.
He's just money hungry.
POV: When you need the spare change
Dude literally has a tattoo that says Nevermind on his chest. He’s just broke and looking for money 🙄
Bs. I read an article where he was saying he thought it was cool until he got older snd started to date women and they poked fun at him for not making money off of it. So now he's trying to make a big deal about it . He shouldn't win
I never liked the album cover because frankly, I don't like seeing baby genitals. But I think he's doing it for the money.
The worthless dude is broke AF and wants to be something to talk about again.
Sounds desperate for cash!
Why does the black censor circle cover that much area, is it that big?
Nervana???? Xd
We see babies in there birthday suit all the time lol I feel bad for that slow guy
There is a poster of that somewhere near where I live and its uncensored it seems unreal but it isnt
My man's is trying to make a quick buck💀
Money money
I’m with him, that’s kind of cruel. And even if he did recreate it it may just be because he accepted that was his entire life and decided to live like it. But then realized he never could and wanted a chance to restart his life
Drugs cost alot after being famous for a picture all the drugs and girls he got drugs and hookers
This is old news, and he only did it for clout
His parents and the company didn't respect his dignity.
How tf is no one commenting on "nervana"
“Nirvana”
He saw an opportunity for alot of money and is trying to take it
Ah yes, a publicity stunt because no one recognizes you anymore.  Also, good luck losing it.  Your parents gave them full consent
He wants money
Can u believe after 30 years he's still chasing the dollar? Some bs f this guy 😒
.
Get a life sue your parents...😁😁😁✌✌✌
He's in it is for the money only. He was never traumatized!
I mean I don’t agree with it but not surprised. And after all it like…is child porn. Like…it just is. It’s a nude photograph of a child so yeee. Try to defend that lol your cia agent finna put you on a watch list
I think he is an idiot and so are his parents for letting people take his picture.
He just wants money and he's doing it in a pathetic way
He should sue his parents, they allowed it and probably got paid already! Quit ur bitchin'
I understand why because they put a baby underwater for a stupid picture
He’s not wrong to sue, but the trauma stuff is bullshit
L
for those people thats like "he probably needs money, he should lose" dont act like you wouldnt do the same, and if he does it as an adult thats different than unwillingly doing it as a fucking minor, ffs grow up
Good Grief anything to make a buck won't you sure ur parents they allowed to him do it so....
for the money
Money money money money.....money...
And he lost didn't he
I call bs on this
He just want a quick cashout
he also celebrated nirvanas anniversary for a couple years now. mans just tryna get some $$$. kinda pathetic tbh.
the case got thrown out :/
Old news
"Nervana"
First before you say this please learn how to spell
How this even got through all the rules and regulations back then amazes me!!! You couldn't even say there word shit on TV or radio and print. Let alone a naked baby!!!
As if anyone, ANYONE would recognize him if he didn’t keep telling this story. the things people will do for their 15 minutes of fame or a buck is just ridiculous 🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Hes mad because his wee wee never got bigger
He stopped getting his 15 minutes of fame and now he wants some more
If he can't make money shaking his ass on tiktok or eating tide pods on YouTube..what's a guy to do?..get a real job pshhh not this generation
He just wants money 😂
......this is one of the most stupid things I've seen a while
He needs drug money.
Its just a snowflake trying to get easy money by claiming he was hurt. In all honesty its only because of that picture, that he is even known.
I think he's either in debt or has addiction issues.
my only question is why the title says "Nervana" instead of "Nirvana" uncultured bro
He a damn lie and attempting to extort…. Quite sure they got paid for the album cover when it was done…. And he should sue his parents if he feels he was exposed or caused damage to his mental because they allowed it🤦🏽‍♀️
Just another junkie liberal looking for a pay day!
He just wants money
N be dead
What a frivolous lawsuit.
I agree with him. And the fact that he has recreated and has a tattoo doesn't matter to me because we all go through fases in life and try different ways to deal with our traumas.
Seems like he is just taking advantage of the opportunity to make money off of it, as he found out that he could
Looking for easy money  What an a__hole
Sensationalism, Seeking attention and bank accounts
nah that boy is just broke and looking for the come up we all wish we had
Tbh, he don't look the same, so unless he just be going around telling people he's the baby, idk how people could recognize him. But sue his parents for giving away pictures of their naked baby for moneu
Nuravana*
He is totally lying he should sue his parents if anything he probably wants money and attention
Can't have shit in Detroit  And what kind of trauma could he have gained from this
He should grow up
Follow the money, pure and simple
Old story bro
LAAAAAAAAAAAME!
He just wants money
Only in America
POV you revive someone to sue them about something you got famous for
He certainly has willingly put his face forward as being that person so I would say he has no victim..
Dude they wouldn't be alive lmao
Its baloney, he just wants easy money
nirvana*
He's like everyone else in society willing to sue just to get something for nothing, no morals and an ugly human being.
To be fair… it’s literally cp… should have never been there in the first place and it’s creepy that it even was.
"CRAZIER"
I've never seen this album censored anywhere
He should cobain himself in court
Bro but it’s iconic
Imagine being that poor that you need to sue someone for that
He’s full of
Just for the money. Every couple of years he tries to sue them. I remember at least one or two other times he tried
It’s not fart
so he's sueing a dead person 🤔
He can try but I garuntee it has surpassed the statute of limitations
Looking to get a check, that’s all
Learn to spell nirvana
He probably ashamed it’s the same size
He broke
He's made money off recreating the picture.  He will lose.
Never gonna get it never gonna get it. He is a pos obviously and should problem get a job
Ehhhh fuck emmm alll
BS, That’s what I think! Provided it’s true and not fake!
My favorite band, Nervana.
This is fake
nIrvana
Babies always look the same, it’s not like you’d be able to recognize him
6th
When you need a way to continue doing heroin
lmao 🤣 sounds like he's trying to get a quick pay day
I would too 😩😩
Dave grohl can easily pay the entire suit
The first time I saw the photo was on my moms phone
technically “he” consented to it, as in his parents consented for him. he should take legal action against his parents if he really thinks it’s wrong.
1¹
He’s trying to make a quick buck. Yeh chief your a turd
idc I would get my moneyyy
He should sue his parents who took him to the picture set and got paid
2
He must need money, he should lose.
