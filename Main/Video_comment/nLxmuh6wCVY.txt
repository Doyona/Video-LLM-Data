When I though this was the worst performance ever, I was wrong
Commentator: You'll never see anything like thing.  Then boom, 7-0.

Liverpool 2024 in old trafford will 8-0 man utd

The noise from the crowd tells you it was a great home game for United.
I am a CR7 fan...❤ best wishes..Please do this every time with this team...🎉🎉
❤❤❤
😂 This is nothing compared to a cool 7-0 score haha
what is wrong with MUFC
Cr7 hijo de Van dijk
Bek mu yang tak bisa menjaga pertahanan
We came, we pissed and we mocked Yanited. 😄 🤣 😂 😆  🤣 . Battered in their Backyard.
7-0  4-0 0-5  ICONIC!! love this team so much
Maguire should be Man U coach.
Salah is Manchester United worst nightmare. He always manage to make difference against them.
I bet this is happening this yr once again
If Kieta wouldn't be this injury prone he could be great asset to this team..
its almost 2 years already since this happened, i remember seeing this results for the first time and i was like "holy f, Maguire masterclass"
'Defeat' for Manure is so sweeeeet......
nutted over ronaldo face
5-0 at old toilet or 7-0 at Anfield?
😍😍😍😍
Keita's best game
Gene 8 olmadı
Salah the one season wonder ! Where are those idiots at the moment 😂
My idol fristiano caganaldo got humbled and embarrassed by liverpool 🥶🥶🥶👻👻👻🇵🇹🐪🐪
9-0 vs Man United (5-0 at Old Trafford, 4-0 at Anfield) 7-0 vs Man United (at Anfield) 4-0 vs Man United (at Old Trafford) 5-1 vs Arsenal (at Anfield) 5-1 vs Arsenal (at Anfield)    Liverpool are indeed the Bayern Munich of England.
What about ronaldo
So satisfying 🧖

Penaldo got humbled 😭
I love seeing United lose to Liverpool FC
Good salah
😃😃😃
Keitas best game for us. By far. He was great here. If this is the level we’d get by him, he’d leave as an absolute great. But he never reached the level again…
Salah is 🔥😅
MANCHESTER UNITED 🇰🇭
Yes salah get in
They didn't like this 😅😅😅😅
OOOOOOO!!!! HOW I LOVE 💕 THIS 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Poor man divided 😂😂

Anyone revisiting this after Liverpool amazingly qualified for  Europa League?

theater of broken dreams
This is an historic win which we lfc fans will remember for decades.
one of the best night in my life. the match, the kit, and the circumtances i was surrounded with were so so perfect. i will miss this moment forever❤
I Feel Like We Don't Need To Sign Anyone This Summer.We Should Save The Money For January To Buy A Big Name Player
We should have gone for more goals in the 2nd half.. literally stopped attacking keeping position with opposition down to 10 men..
The predecessor to the great 7-0
Manchester united net is very seductive to Liverpool players. 5-0 then 7-0.  Looking forward to 9-0
❤❤
5-0 and now 7-0. If this was UCL, aggregate: LIV 12-0 MNU
4-5-7 🤗
Liverpool king fc vs Emyu lawak fc

Eth took the team from 0 5 to 0 7. Great job. And he bought 170m players who bottled up anyways in big matches. Let s be real, casemiro and anthony won t bring us the EPL

I have a few utd fans in my contacts and after that game I rubbed all of them
Watching this has become a tradition
맹구 올해는  '우승컵 주고 시작하시지요'  안하냐 ㅉㅉ
I'm LFC to the bone.. M. Salah best player on this side of the Solar system.. Jazakallah Sir.
Even Ronaldo doesn't want to play for man u again
Saf wished he wasn't there to. Watch that game enough said
Harry Maguire had a great game for liverpool.
Christa Ronaldo shittyyyy
โด้เตะเด็ก ไร้การเป็นมืออาชีพ
Both Maguire and Shaw defends like a donkey.
Mo Salah .. absolutely wonderful
Best of Salah
Mana team menyu dalam ni?? Team sampah.. boooo menyu... bodoh kena rogol sampai 5 bijik
Man u can hire pep,klopp,tuchel all at once and still be thrashed by watford
Just coming back to feel better after a 4:0 lost
Hey what's about Thailand 🔥🔥🥵🥶
Best game of the season for Liverpool total dominance. 😍😍
3 goals . Thanks to Lord Harry Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
Liver pool club abbigest fantastic team
The day I started supporting Liverpool
Alex ferguson can assemble the best side he ever coached and still get thrashed by this liverpool side 😂😂😂
Shaw...
Liverpool vs real Madrid 2017 Cr7 perfect 😍
I was having a pretty bad to tbh. . . . This cheered me up no end:)
So easy
EŞŞOGLESSEK MANUM BENİM

It's Tradition to watch it once in a while Now 7-0 😆
When Salah insulted Manchester United 😂😂
Stop saying “Liverpool played so well” They’re going against ole for gods sake
I'm a man utd fan but we gonna win
Chill, its united
I love Salah! And I love Liverpool!
0-5!!!! I never knew that was possible!!! GO LIVERPOOL!!!
Q kasian sama Pogba yg kartu merah sama sama tak sengaja,meskipun saya fans Liverpool tapi nggak tega liatnya
Beta penaldog and their 450 millon fans
If you watch carefully, you can realize that H. Maguire made at least one mistake in every goal ocassion
Commentator's crass reporting of ..."it's absolutely 'ridiculous' from this Liverpool number 11 at the moment"... he was lost for words he actually meant was (without using the totally worn out  'awesome') ; fabulous, brilliant, wonderful, breath taking, mesmerising, skilful, amazing, magnificent, glorious, superb, majestic, out of this world, first class, mind-blowing, incredible, spectacular, stunning, extraordinary, remarkable, astonishing, delightful, etc, etc.   Ridiculous synonymous with; absurd, preposterous, ludicrous, laughable. Can't be bothered with any more, you know the rest.   Fandabifeckindozi.  Evolved from Everton in '63 and raised as red. Proud to have witnessed it all.  Hope for more of the sublime before I'm dead. Peace to you all.
maguire 😅
i go for liverpool and my frend manchester united and we made kindof a bet but there is nothing on the line and this hapens
Imagine predicting 5-0, Salah hat trick and Pogba red card
Play Theme from Benny Hill (Yakkety Sax) under this and its almost bearable to watch
Look at Maguire 😂😂😂😂
I'm still in pain from our defeat to Madrid but somehow coming back to this always makes things better
did Liverpool win away
Mjaui
❤️
Semangat  muhammad   salah
HARRY MAGUIRE!
MU SO EZ LOL
G(old)
Jeez man, what a downfall for mo. He’s been terrible of late.
I developed a habit of watching this highlights from time to time, seeing United demolished by 10-0 in a single campaign with a so called “GOAT 😂” in a pitch is actually pleasant to watch
Maguire you are the GOAT!!! ♥♥♥
mo sala
suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii is soooooooooooooo badddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Kasian Mu di bantai pemain lawak mu
Goals 37. Keita (3rd, 2nd in Premier League) 38. Jota (4th, 4th in Premier League) 39. Salah (13th, 8th in Premier League) 40. Salah (14th, 9th Premier League) 41. Salah (15th, 10th in Premier League)
2 matches against man united was the top views of match highlights
Mo could empty a stadium in minutes 🤣🤣
👎👎👎🍿❤️➡️👏👏👏👏Cr7❣️❣️❣️
Man utd are better
Salah was super this time.  Meanwhile, Liverpool could win the Champions League by beating Real with such force.
Poor man u
Bro if Mo Salah wakes up in the cl final and score 3 bangers definitely will be likely to win the ballon d’or 👏🏻🐐🇪🇬
Salah ❤️
Dont be a fool sapot liv
Go luv
To be fair Liverpool has Maguire helping them 😂
🔴💪🏻
good game🤞
We love you Liverpool
Relentless....one word to sum up this liverpool performance
Who else has watched this 20+ times ? 😘
Lets remember this match until 100 years
Henderson is understand bro what a pass
aku fans liverpool 😣🔥🔥
Man untd Chelsea
This is 55555555 at old Trafford ? Only Liverpool can do that!! 🫤😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥

salah - best player maguire - bad player
Is Salah the best or what?
Pogba Hahahaha What sport does he really play?
This was the most disaster home match for Man Utd against Liverpool of the year........
Penaldooooooooo
This shows how weak Manchester united really is
siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
The man, the myth, and the Legend  Harry "God" Maguire.
mu bek y jelek
This game started the downfall of Manchester United...
Ndak ado nan sarik dek salah do 😅
All goals pass thought the king: Maguire
Mohammed Salah is Legend. Very wonderful
Tak ada rt ett
I came back after the 4:0 win simba mane lion Kang
1:49
mu 0 : 9 Liverpool
Now 4-0 🤣
After 4-0
Wow 3 goals from m Salah I'm form Egypt like him
If you want to know the difference between Liverpool and Man Utd watch the first goal but just follow Andy Robertson. At 0:02 he plays a pass down the line and between him and the goal on his side of the pitch there are 6 Man Utd players 1 or 2 of which have a 30 yard head start on him. Just 6 seconds later at 0:08 he has sprinted passed all 6 United players all of whom are jogging to create a 3 on 1 situation, Salah could have played him in instead of Keita. That was all off the ball, nothing to do with footballing ability, just pure effort and desire. No wonder Man Utd fans are so frustrated.
Dissolve the Man United team right now.
Theater of dream, in this context a nightmare dream
Who come back here after 4_ 0 at anfield
2022 9-0
Watch Liverpool practice passing at Old Trafford
I will ALWAYS come back here
1:30 Even the ball wants to go to Salah's feet!
I’m here after home game 😂😂😂 we destroyed Red Devils by 4-0 🤣😂🤣
Who’s here after 4-0 at Anfield????
N ronaldo is invisible
Only I know The Difficulties of Being a Manchester United Fan 😀😀
Who is here after Manchester United Took L today😁
A pesar de la rivalidad los fans de Liverpool los mejores👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This liverpool team and Mo left me speechless!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man u is going to win
Another big day
History maybe repeat itself tonight
What a signing, what a player. Game changer.. An absolute world class performance by harry maguire.
jeez that lad is fierce.
Manchester united positioning is the worst i have ever seen
All because maguire 🥱🥱🥱
Need a repeat from Salah this week against ManU
When coach want to win the game of tomorrow should tell his wings make wright and left backs of Liverpool very much busy but I don't have the telephone number of RR
I remember when I used to play football in marshy fields and my teammates always used to rebuke me " why the **** are you blocking your own teammates !!??" Now after watching Sir Harry Humiliating Maguire, I am assured I was doing legendary .....
Hope this repeats
Good Friday
ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE
Mo salaaaaaaaaaah 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️
Soy solo yo o DeGea se ve como diciéndose a sí mismo: ¿Que sigo haciendo de portero en MU?
Bagus sekali liverpool, salam dari indonesia fans
I love this game
To easy match
what a found for Liverpool. strongest team this season
One of the Best Sundays Ever..
After this game all Liverpool fans miss Ole terribly . 😁
ASLIIIII...KEREN BANGAAAAATTT LIVERPOOL..MU MAEN LIGA TARKAM AJA SEKARANG, KASIHAAAAANN...UHUY
Man United are back
134648اكىب
Maybe Man Utd should bring back Beckham, for money purposes
There are only 3 managers in club football, pep, klopp, tuchel
Pep klopp and who else, Beckham?
Manchester United can still buy mbappe, and still win the title in 30 years time, with the help of maguire $70 million pounds
In a parallel universe Man U beat liverpool 10 - 0 but no one wants to talk about that.
I love you mohammad salah only you not messi ronaldo mbappe only I love you mohammad salah
0:49 amazing playmaking and passing...
Awesome to watch again, however, the thing that is not most impressive, but most disturbing, is the absolute lack of remorse by pogba after an extremely vicious tackle, the word scum comes to mind.
Salah is a king
Man U is weak
When I have a bad day, I always come to see this clip..
firmino's impact in this game is largely unnoticed or completely ignored.....a true false 9 in my opinion.
Mo Salah mo Salah running down the wing the best in the world!!!
Wow
2nd goal, Maguire. 🤭
Watching this back 6 months later, as great as this was, when they went down to 10 we really missed a trick. If we’d gone at them hard we could’ve really rubbed their faces in it. 7, 8 or 9. Still, it was awesome.
Salah what a player
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 Salah
Liverpool is the best
Has anyone noticed how careless and indifferent Maguire was, absolute legend. The guy even pushed his teammates to let opponent score, Kindness at its peak.
Red dog

OMG ... 14M view 55555555
I hate Liverpool
I watch this often, love seeing manure put to the sword.😂😂😂😂
Great day YNWA
the real score is 10-0 manchester united wins
The fifth goal. Henderson tackles in the centre circle, Salah scores................... 6 secs
♥️♥️
If we wanted we could have scored 3 more goals after red card 🤗 but Liverpool showed respect for man United 😇 can we play like this against man city in semi final or FA Cup and League game against them?
I have ZERO respect for Manchester United and Everton. other scousers might not hate them completely and might respect some of their legends but I don't. YNWA
Maguire wouldn't even be a sub for my pub team.
Bewtifull !!
🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
La fessée hahahaha . Vous les avez dominez les pauvres
Still watch this around once a week
Mo Salah is humiliating the team faced like Manchester, make glory the tim him stay and shame on the team that had been left behind like Chelsea, wait second Liverpool will be like Chelsea and  As.roma. Let mo salah make barca or PSG great again wohoho...

Lol max Guy
Pogba looked happy to leave
Legendary match
Mohammed salah is amazing player and the best in engaland
How kind of Liverpool to take their foot off the gas after the fifth. Such compassion is rare in football.
Whenever I'm feeling down, I'd watch this and immediately cheers me up and makes my day.
The whole match i was watching tobey maguire.
Viva liverpool
That first goal doesn't get talked about enough. Textbook Liverpool goal starting from deep in our half: Robbo -> Jota -> Bobby -> Mo -> Naby Lad .... BOOOM! ⚽🔥
Why has the referee not awarded ManU United 6 penalties?
Brilliant!
Liverpool sucks
Where is ronaldo 🤣🇮🇩🤣
Nobody’s talking about how bad maguire is

MU Ampas🤣🤣
Football fans on TikTok: This is gonna be SO INTENSE!!!     M.Salah: I'm about to end this mans whole carrier
🥰😇👍
I like how we eased off on them after the red, because we were worried about how much busier it would get outside if even more Utd fans tried to leave
Maguere
After what my club did to leeds united, I just can't stop watching of this kind of matches. Man city we are coming for you. This our year
❤️

Con esta goleada Cristiano se convirtió en el primer futbolista en la historia que se come una manita en el clásico inglés y español. Cómo siempre mi comandante rompiendo récords siuuuuuuuuu 💪💪💪

Liverpool vs Manchester United ❌ Liverpool vs ManSister ✅
Every so often I come back here just to reminisce   😊
When I'm sad…. I just play music and watch this

Bitches come and go bruhh but This match stays !
Mo Salah owns Mufc
united be like, we are Manchester united we have a football team
I’m a utd fan but I’m just here for an edit
They should have done the muvelo celebration
glory glory man united
How did Manchester United pay 80 million for Harry slap head wow he’s is so bad and Luke Shawn pure rubbish
so much for the fortress that is OLD TRAFFORD
All the goals because of Shaw.  What a terrible defender, sell him
I am proud to be a liverpool fan!
It should have been 0-14 or more
Christians of U.K had Salah (Muslim Egyptian) into their team while Egypt do not allow Christian Egyptian players to play into its national team. Christians all over the world should treat those garbage the same treatment. But however, this is the difference between us, we don't carry hatred against people based of religion but they do bcz they are sick. I'd be very ashamed if my religion like that salad player.
Best England
Pls extend salah and mane contract
Mo salah
I am a Man U fan and I accept that for now Liverpool are better than us
team sampah
Ливерпуль 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Hahaha
Crynaldo ghosting as usual😂
Love this highlights so much. Love LFC from THAILAND.
Here after Greenwood...
I do not know how many times I watched this video. But always I love the theatre of dream turn into the theatre of nightmare 😂😂😂😂
Fgvfyvg💛💛💛💛💛💚💛✌✌✌
The no1 man M.Utd must immediately replace is Maguire. He's like a clown as a central defender, running after all balls like little kids playing...
Let laugh at man utd once again 🙊🙊🙊🙊
Sala es el rey de egipto
Semangat
This is LFC s goodbye to Solskjaer, he was once a paying member of Kristiansund LFC fan club
Came here just to see the worst defence of all time (as a United fan)
😀
✌✌✌
Poor Man U when i say that I mean no I hate them gg tho scoring 5 vs cr7 and the rest of Man U
Hehehehe
Maguire is probably one of the worst defenders in the league. Textbook definition of a clogger
Can't beleived i watched this again as a United fan but how the hell did this man (Ole) continue after this to manage those other game. Not only shows how far we have fallen but how in the dark the people running the club are!
Sometimes when I’m down I come back to this😂 what a result
Egyptian Kings Hatric vs rivals
Damn what a day to be a Liverpool fan
Pogba rubbish
Man of the match this game : no.5 mu player ...
Salah scores like is in training..soft bt tactical.
Salah was hatrick to goal and Ronaldo was also hatrick to jones. 😂
Why they didn’t played Fonaldo
This is why we live old trafford
Yoook ke goa yoook 🗿
United fans will remember this for life.
I remember this match, I was still on my way home and I called my buddy to ask the score and he said 3-0. I thought wow okay the match has already ended, who's man of the match? And he said mate, it's first half 🤣
That pass from Henderson 🤤
OldTrafford remoook gaes
I became a Liverpool fan after watching this game. 😊❤❤
❤❤❤

Cristiano Ronaldo kicked Jones   But M.Salah fucked  The whole Manchester United that day
CR5
Mo Salah no seve
You don't score 5 goals against a team and still have mercy on them. But Liverpool did the same to man utd. Will never forget this  5-0 Mercy.
Liverpool i love u ♥️♥️♥️

I love Liverpool FC, from Pakistan
Maguire and Shawn were the best players for Liverpool
Before his goal from Alissons assist there was a big thing about salah not scoring against man utd. He's absolutely dominated them since... I struggled to write this in the time he'd scored his hat-trick in the video. Lol
Almost forgot to watch this today
Thank you Liverpool Thank you Maguire 💩 for bringing Ralf Rangnick 😭
I'll quote the commentator" ruthless and swashbuckling".
Liver ý thức phòng dịch tốt thật,rất tuân thủ theo quy tắc năm không.
The score brought Ronaldo good old memories if you know what I mean.
Man utd. 0 mohd salah 3..fantastic show by liv.
Man  United  nood
Enjoy this cause you won't get this again be ready for the ending.
24 oct remember the day
Ole's at the Wheel.... Lalalalalala...... Best Performance of Liverpool 🔥

Liverpool isbluv
🙈🙈
4 years ago I would’ve said man united was better but in 2019 I played a game of PES using them and then watched the premier league (I normally only tune in for the champions league and the final world cup) and man was I wrong, now Liverpool is my favorite team.
Send me any amount of money into my account and I will refund you 4 times the amount back. Mll
Best match EVER!!!
Muhammadl Salah is in his best years he's in his peak. Cristiano Ronaldo is not close to his peak. I hope people would stop comparing the 2 together because it is not fair.
is it real that ronaldo cant do anything ? is the star was 👎?? 😂😂😂
ماشاء الله على صلاح
MUNYUK TOLOL
Ronaldo! Welcome to Liverpool.
If Messi or Ronaldo had done this. Ballon D'or instantly.
محمد صلاح أفضل لاعب في العالم حاليا

Liverpool is amazing

Good news liverpool team players
So nice liverpool and Mohammed Salah.
Salah vs Manchester United 😅😅😅
Mohmad Salah best primer league
Manchester United after the appointment of Ralph Rangnick:  You have staked yourself now Klopp! No longer in the minds of men but on Anfield you will be fought! And if nothing but a miracle will accomplish your doom, that miracle, the Red devils will perform!
If you watch this everyday as well as liverpool vs barcelona 4-0, Liverpool v spurs champions league final then you are garnered to have all your worries go awayt
They could have scored 10 if they wanted to
This will NEVER get old
Everyday I comeback here😁😁

Can’t believe PL fans are voting for a Bundesligian tap-in merchant all cause Salah plays for Liverpool
محمد صلاح لاعب رائع
Man United is so chicken
(French) Connaissez-vous cette vérité?  1. Les nuages ​​du ciel du monde entier sont descendant sur la terre de plus en plus chaque jour.  2. Le soleil et la lune dans le ciel sont super lune et super soleil tous les jours.  3. Si vous regardez de près le lever et le coucher du soleil, vous pouvez voir le ciel rose.  4. Les composants chimiques de Chemtrail sont pulvérisés comme un fou dans le ciel du monde entier.   5. Si vous regardez de près la lune maintenant, la lune tourne.
Where was Maguire?
Premier league isn’t easy go and tell to ronaldo please
Ahahah Ronaldo suka
United should have brought out their training cones instead. Would have made filming the match a bit easier.
My eyes hurt
Liverpool vs sri Lanka... 5-0
YNWA.... Wow... Glory glory glory man United... Woooow hahahaha... LoL
He’s simply unrivalled in PL.
الله اكبر
Liverpool FC have way too much class and talent for that Old Trafford mob, who should learn how to play professional football.😂
Lez go salah
won't lie, I feel sorry this man utd team, absolutely amazing but the manager is dreadful. much respect to liverpool though, total football dominance. haven't seen a rival beat another rival like this since fc barcelona 5-0 real madrid. and ronaldo was there too 😭😭😭
Awesome
Glory Glory to man utd 💪💪💪💪
man u is literally free content 😂
hey  guys mo salah is  a best player in  the world
Proud on Mohammed Salah from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Mo Salsa as as as as his a real king

McGuire I dunt lyk..its like robot...
This gotta be one of the worst football i ever seen tho, good for Salah for scoring i love him, but every action was just awful from both teams it's crazy
Mo Salah Mo Salah running down the wing....🥰
The Man City demolition was the best though, this one not so much
1 Liverpool😍am 1 msalah

SOMO MALAH
Freds got to go, worst one on pitch

If what you're seeing is true, the Liverpool team can be dangerous....
Wow!! Liverpool
Muhammad Salah 😎😎😎❤❤❤
😍😍😍
Livpool is on fire in the game
And then they lose to West Ham 3-2. Ironic
Salah..made giant man utd looked like alien to football game
I think the only part that people love is Virgil fighting with Ronaldo
Maaf ya net....mudah2an  menchester uneted tahun ini...TERDEGRADASI KE LIGA TWO....semoga ya ted....biar apes kmu ted....😭😭😭😭
jestescie koks
I'm learning here, why was pogba sent off? Wasn't his first contact on the ball?
les équipes de PL sont quand même mille fois plus séduisantes à voir jouer que les équipes de ligue1 conforama... C'est incomparable!
Ronaldo deserves a red card Its a deliberate attack not an injustice  We know its Ronaldo but no courtesy
Ajj
It is not about there is Ronaldo in MU....it is about the team work....good job Liverpool...and the lost continued in Derby...once again the citizen smack MU on their own stadium....and....with Ronaldo in it
What da Cristiano Ronaldo doin tho??
I think ManU is not a rival anymore. Actually, it's been a few years since they are not our rival anymore. lol
How is Harry Maguire even a professional football player
Uau
I think this victory deserves more likes.
Magnífico
Ole out
Wow 🥺🥺😳

Ronaldo : I made the wrong move  Maguire was their 12th man Liverpool deserved to beat and salah is my role model
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mo Salah is a devout Muslim. he knows how to be grateful to his creator by doing prostration of gratitude. love it Liverpool ❤️❤️❤️
WHAT HAPPEND TO MANCHESTER  RONALDO CAPTAIN U KNOW YOUR JOB
Muito 😍😍
Why take your foot off the gas at 5-0?   It's so remote a team will be in this position against utd again for ages..... I feel they should have at least gone for the record and put 7 goals in.
Una squadra che ha ereditato 2 ex juventini non potrà mai vincere !!!
What a easy win love it when them dodgey Manks lose makes the best tv ever

If Baily was playing things would have been much better in this game but Ole does not even know that he lost because he was benching the world class defender
Tampang si Pogba puas banget wkt diusir. Buset..
I hope MU fans can't forget this sweet moment
I will treasure this for the rest of my life ! Thank you ❣
Empat sehat lima kosong
Most satisfying best ever match. Never ever gonna let Man U fans forget this

SING ; you never walk alone...
CR7  has smashed this 11 before many times. If he ad the team he would have done it again. He will CR7  The one and only.
Anyone who has go'ogled the rules byRenatta Kirmzel wouldn’t end up being surprised this kind of works. It isn’t really always the situation, but you can expect to make your yeast infection vanish within a a couple days.

This proves that Liverpool is the best team.
This is prove that teamwork more important than rely on 1 star...
3 Goals and 2 Assissts against Man United is just Insane. Salah is in the form of his life.
Udh seminggu masih aja masuk trending video ini di Indonesia, kasian fans MU jadi trauma liat YouTube
Manchaster united  always in my heart 😑
Where is master penaldo?

Pertandingan yang menegangkan

One of the best videos in youtube
GG!
Bubuk
conter attack Ala Totenham hospur ... manager mourinho......
The coach was very useless. How will you 🌟 t the likes of greenwood and Fred who doesn't pass and tackle roughly respectively? WHY doesn't he believe in Jesse lingard? Why didn't he begin Sancho instead of greenwood and lastly but not leastly, even a blind man faults this 1. Why will he save Pogba, the highest assister in the tournament then bring him on when the team has lost concentration in a 4-0 scoreline which inflicted frustration in Paul and his red card saw him off. If these amendments above were in formation. No chance will Liverpool slide with ease to triumph though they may win. I Don't give credit/distinction to Liverpool because United was not at 💯%. Honestly the coach is cubanite.

Alhamdulillah, Salah you are the beast!!!
Penaldo iL mijor di la historIa 😭😭😭👊 si hubiera empujado el balon el liverpool se hubiera quedado en 0 😈😈😈😈
Salah: the new Messi 😊
where's C.R?
United has a defense crisis, they behaving like amateurs like really, there is nothing attach can do with a defense that weak, they will always be demotivated, they need a new defense or to find something that will really inspire the lads at the back
i am not a liverpool fan but Wow wow wow, thumbs up
Osimhen of Napoli is better than Sallah
Respect to Liverpool. They can play football.

Christiano Ronaldo: Mo Salah is fantastic but nothing like me. Me: Mo Salah is nothing like you because you can't score goals 😂
McGuire the capten clown 😂
Manchester United in crisis 😂
too easy
Egyptian King!
United has the worst defender i ever seen
Ronaldo Vs Salah
Henderson's assist to Salah is just unreal.
Let it be defeated these red devils
Woow
Imagine United get Liverpool on round of 16 cl 😂🤣 I’d predict 10-0 on aggregate 😂🤣

De gea dari dulu udh sangat cerdas,kiper proffesional terhebat

Shame on you MU.

Hasil yang sangat memuaskan yang pernah saya lihat
Mourinho💀💰 pudrió hasta la raíz al Manchester United
Barcelona game?
Well done Liverpool. But do not get ahead of ourselves. The season has just started. Remember Manu only need chemistry between Ronaldo and other players and everything will change. Their problem right now is denial and not passing balls to Ronaldo. If they overcome that Liverpool must strive to go a notch higher to win the Premier league. No relaxing boys it is not gonna be a walk in the park.
Oh my God, Limo kosong bantai dek salah nyee, ayo mantap yia
Pemain mu kurang kompak, ronaldo kerja sendiri di permalukan
The Best ever Liverpool player:  Salah or Gerrard ?
날강두가 리버풀선수를 발로 때리고 싸움을 벌어서 할 말이 없다.
우리 FC서울의프렌즈 친구 맨유가 리버풀에게 0대5으로 져 울드 드래프트축구장에서 굴욕적인 참패를 당해서 씁쓸하다.
Let's go 30million views!
United think they have Ronaldo and become Elite Club again...🤣🤣🤣...and this 5-0 prove they are still mediocre
MOHAMMED SALAH...😍
O my

That's the greatest win in Liverpool history. Even greater than the 2005 Champions League final

"นักเตะเหล่านี้ต้องมีส่วนร่วมรับผิดชอบอย่างมากด้วย พวกเขาเป็นผู้เล่นระดับโลก, นักเตะทีมชาติ และสโมสรอย่างแมนเชสเตอร์ ยูไนเต็ด ต้องการให้พวกเขาแสดงศักยภาพออกมาให้เต็มที่  นักเตะเหล่านี้้ต้องรู้สึกเจ็บปวดเมื่อพวกเขาพ่ายแพ้"       "สโมสรแห่งนี้มีความต้องการในระดับสูง เต็มไปด้วยแรงกดดัน และผมมองเห็นนักเตะหลายคนไม่ยอมวิ่งลงไปช่วยแดนหลัง ไม่สนใจที่จะเล่นเกมรับ ไม่ทุ่มเทอย่างเต็มที่ในการเล่น และนั่นเป็นสิ่งที่ยอมรับไม่ได้ คุณช่วยบอกผมหน่อยซิว่าแบบนี้มันเป็นความผิดของผู้จัดการหรือเป็นความผิดของนักเตะ ? ผมก็ไม่รู้นะ
In this season Manchester United is really bad when Ronaldo came in this team and Ronaldo 50% will quit this football bc he’s team so bad
Pogba change your haircut you look silly...

As a manchester fanboy it's painful to watch this . Spurs beat ManU 6-1 at old Trafford and again this time 0-5 . What a shame on OGS and what the fuk is he doing . Is he making the greatest losing  records at old Trafford ??
CR7 tetap semangat ganteng,, salah, selamat..
Fans will remember this for decades.

We will never walk alone.  Bye bye manu. The end of CR7 career by Liverpool goats. Nothing is permanent not even Maradona or Pele everything have time.  Liverpool don't buy extremely expensive player but they create it and produce best of best but united buys them.   Liverpool is roasting Manchester united.
Brilliant goals! Well played Liverpool
Salah kabeh wes
Ole out
MU maennya ga pake keper
BISAAN NJIR
Man utd were so bad they don't even deserve a place in highlights
0:22 that ball into that space by roberson was intelligent. this is why he's the best in the league.  it isn't really to anybody but it's just what you should do, and it paid off. liverpool play more intelligently.  the play a mix of barcelona and other styles.  and robertson is the most underrated danger player in that squad... his footballing brain.  but united's tactics are all over the place. you have to stop liverpool's fullbacks. they freely allowed pool to play. they allowed a cl wining squad to play.  the united players have given up on ole. they're not even tacking back anymore. maybe they didn't like his open tactics for this game but it looks like they want him out.  he's managing a bunch of players that think he's inept.
Salah... The best
Emang Pemain kalo Hattrick Salah ya? Salah nya dimana, kan pemain bola emang berusaha menciptakan gol sebanyak2nya yg penting sah.
Nyom Nyom luss
Goa mana goa

Salah what is..an alien?
Si brewok is the best
Nothing sweeter then beating Man U can’t stand them !!! And hurry up and get Salah contract done more wonderful things to come !!! Liverpool have fans worldwide that’s how much the world loves Liverpool

first goal the referee was running faster than manunited defenders
Ronaldo is not at all in fault.. His only second 5-0 loss in career.. This will not be remembered
😥😥😥
LoL Man Utd 😂😂
Is this how you Manchester United?
Salah totally alone in the box for the 4th goal. Arguably best player in the league and left alone Manchester United professional team LoL 🤣
Mohd Salah is great 🥰👌
I rarely seeing funeral on youtube

Funny, if you see Paul Scholes at BT Sport After the match against Atalanta about the way Man Utd did play in the first half. In this match exactly happined what he has said there.
Lol

Man United's defense is trash

Mo salah for ballon dor 🏆👍
Best moment
The collective groan from OT when they see that pass from Hendo to Mo is a joy to listen to!!!
Manchester United are the best siiiiiiiii

Beknya payah sering slh posisi dan  telat nutup ruang
The media isnt allowed to give mo what he desrves  His name is mohamed (hated already) His name is salah (second hated name) Arab (duh) African (no thanks)  U realy expect fifa saying the both hated names in the western world  on the stage for ballon dor?   The point is to keep a christian role model (whoever that is)  Trust me, its deeper than what we see
People saying salah best player in world the aftr scoring open goals with hatrick. Ronaldo be like:-what is hatrick?
Ojalá haci hicieran en Champions
Poppy PPP oooopp

All credit to Liverpool for this victory, though the circumstances and implications for Manchester United are shocking and embarrassing. Salah just keeps on delivering.

Maestro Naby keita is on 🔥🔥 fire. I told you. Just wait he will be 🔙🔜
I don't get Maguire like transfers. 80 Million? Since when?   Outside of England NOBODY rates English players at all. Internationally don't perform . In the premier they bang average but yet we still have Grealish going for 100 million . Ben Whites for 50 million. Ridiculous .... Keep waiting for it to come home. What a joke of a country
Arsenal fans smile look this videos
Not a fan of Liverpool..but hats off to Salah 👏
Is this recent

No use of Honaldo 🥱🥱

It´s time to say goodbye to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
MU should get a good defence asap
Ronldo is always good player
Liverpool blæster dem.

That assist from 4th goal was a piece of art
Remember when Barca beat Madrid with Ronaldo 5-0 with messi hat trick now it’s salah destroying  Manchester 5-0 with his hat trick
M Salah👍👍

Maguire the best defender in the world right now😊
What a pass from Henderson to salah
Thank You…. We Will Never Walk Alone 🔥
Anyone else watched this at least a dozen times?
Ole stay
How our defenders was not really organize,especially once i look Maguire is so slowly every game he cost us.He is the kind of defender play with luck ,but once meet with strong striker for sure we lost.Eric Bailly is the best defender we have in Manchester united ,cause he knows how to position himself, he has speed ,strength and he know how to tackle very well ....
man u gotta do smthn
Hahaha Manchester united Channel seems like they didn't post the highlights 😏😏😄😄😄😄
Maguire is one of the worst thing that has happened to Man United's defense
It's time for African to win ballon dor again after weah
Liverpool menang berkat pak jokowi. Terimakasih Pak Jokowi.
That was a legit lesson from Liverpool !
People talking about sala but forgot kaeita
From a Man Utd fan, goodbye Ole

Manchester United defence is a mess
Hahahahahah....nice
trending in nepal 😀😀no4
Over 9 million views... Wow. Compared to a few hundred thousand. A few of them views are probs United fans catching the second half. Must have missed it when they all left the stadium at half time
Everyone is lauding salah and rightly so he was absolutely SENSATIONAL against united, but credit should also be given to keita for a goal, an assist and a key contribution for another goal (the jota goal) hope naby lad is ok and good to go for the upcoming fixtures, tough few months coming and need everyone around especially in midfield.  Also, how robbo managed to thread that ball through to jota for salah's second I will never know. Just magical. Same could be said for hendo's assist, captain fantastic as usual filling in for fab but still putting in a solid game.
Alhamdulillah,thank God and thaks moh salah from indonesia
I wish I could be the boy who received the ball from Mo at the end. 😀😃🙂🙃😊😇
I’ve come here everyday since this MASSIVE win, it really boosts my mood and helps me get through my day, love you reds! And love this fantastic fanbase💪 YNWA🔴🔴

M Salah wow...

Lawak back mu ngakak
Ole stay
Mo Salah is the new KING of Premier League
Fire in the fire😍❤️
Ole should go to Arsenal.  They do well when the manager’s name got something to do with the club.
Before the game I knew Liverpool would beat us, but 5-0. Mad respect for Liverpool, we will never hear the end of this. Lol
Continue commentary premiere league
Salah - 3 goals 1 assists Ronaldo - 3 shots on Jones

As an MU fan, I expected this.
Ronda😂😂😂😂🤣🤣where is yours penalty???the goat🧐😱😱omg
Dont cry cr7
Liverpool champion!
If I were a Man U's fan I would be mad with that defense. With the left side. They forgot there were players on their backs
Salah must be given the Balon d'or  when Liverpool won the Champions League & Premier League title few years ago. Not Messi not Ronaldo.
pertahanan mu Kacau
Where is cr7?
Brilliant salah... 👍👍
unbelievable, Kloppo: ... Mainz, Dortmund, Liverpool...and Salah, the diamond in the middle ofthe ring...
I'm Madridista ...but I love my brother Sala.... assalamu'alaikum brother ..., Full determination...superb performance for Liverpool especially Sala... Brilliant manager ..brilliant player ... I love motto..."You LL never walk alone ... ❤️✌️

Ronaldo dan 10 batang kayu
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Liverpool good job, i like you.❤❤
MU ayam sayur 🤣🤣🤣🤣
mo salah is so cool men
What's  a player i like the player  Salah
PENONTON KECEWA WKWK
I have never eatched soccer in my entire life why is this in my recommendation
This is a statement from liverpool ❣❣💥
Salah is the Best!!🔥
Liverpool is the best team in the world now and Klopp is a God.
When you play versus a fast team like Liverpool, Ronaldo doesn't touch ball.
Awuevos  El Liverpool   El Equipo Que Nunca Camina Solo
Where's the mutv highlights?
That red card is hella questionable ... man got the ball
Klopp. Great leader!
Now MU is nothing for LFC
SALAH IS LEGEND
Amazing liverpool
Salah is a new Maradona! 🔥
曼聯全隊最大貢獻球員非博格巴莫屬！他在最後30分鐘雖然不在場上，卻神奇地幾乎以一己之力，保住曼聯球門不失！
gue ulang ulang sampe 100 goal wkwkw
Mo salah you showed the world the value and skills of the Arab player and good morals….we love liv❤️

Mohamed salah doesnt want to hurt liverpool, after be legend in liverpool maybe he goes to Real Madrid/barcelona who have a good relationship with africa player/arab sponsorship /culture
Liverpool on fire
🇮🇩💗 m0-5alah 💗🇮🇩
Mohammad salah know how to conquer satan, Because he's always been by god's almighty side, And liverpool have a player who works amazingly, You'll Never Walk Alone
This message is to the owners of the club that you are the most miserly with ( Salah ) the best player in the world. Will you repeat what was done by Real Madrid with Cristiano and what Barcelona did with Messi, unfortunately you do not deserve to own this club.
Liverpool
I have watched the highlights 10 times already, still not bored.
tremenda goliza
Allhu akbar
Salah
Mo Salah
Sakit tak berdarah.
ma Rotolando?
Traditionally, a player who scores a hat-trick is allowed to keep the match ball as a memento
😂😂
Sad CR
Can we just say that salah is the most disrespected player in the prem league but is playing like this
Mampus emyu,, trending truss ini wkwkwk
Ese pinche Salah se la turbó mamó con leche de almendras
mo salah 🔥❤️
What a day for United... they'll not forget it for many more years to come.. Liverpool was outstanding...Klopp did a good work in protecting OLE's work.... RESPECT 💯🤣🤣
Proved Provedly m salah
Salah has more goals on Old Trafford this season than Ronaldo
After the first time, the coach, Jurgen, asked the players not to register more bags and enough 4, but Salah at the time was in the bathroom
I just wanna know how man u lostt with Ronaldo bruh. They were playin with kids bruh 😂
Mohamed salah
awokawok kosong lima
Nice match!
This is why I don't watch football! Blaming the Ole for this loss, like the coach were playing for them. Im not a fan of football, but liverpool brutally schooled them in this match. like trying to put out a raging fire with a squirt gun.  On the otherhand, i kind of agree with the manchester united fanbase, like why did Ole just stand there and let it all happen? He's been a man u player before, why didnt he put his shirt on save his team from this ordeal?
Salah is the best
Jordan Handerson... 5th. goal in the match... Crazy assist!!!!
que paliza
Golden time for Liverpool ..tremendous
انا ادعوكم الى الإسلام لأن الإسلام هو الدين الحق وكما ترون محمد صلاح فاخلاقه من القرآن الكريم ❤️
Golden ball for salah
As a Muslim I have duty to my Muslim brother so Im now a fan of liverpool
Man Utd are a bunch of plastic glory-hunters. I will never tire of watching these highlights. Daniel Taylor, Martin Tyler, Gary Neville. YOUR BOYS TOOK ONE HELL OF A BEATING.
Salahhhhhhhh🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
Man UTD defense is trash
Man U has the two worst CB in PL. I mean Victor L and Maguire!! 😳 Both are too slow and should play in Romanian or Polish leagues or something 😂
The 5 daily salahs keeps the devil away!
Salah fc 3 - Mu fc 0
Easy level or unlucky ghost 😪😪
de geya, kova olmus

Mohammad Salah the best 👍👍❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Thank you guys for this amazing gift. They will have nightmares for years, after that!
Benteng yang begitu kokoh membuat lawan frustasi. Van dijk dan ibrahima konate
The definition of “ambling” can be seen at 0:01 to 0:08 : look at where Robertson starts and look at where he is by then. Then look at those red shirts around him and how many he put behind him.
🏁 F1 SALAH
I Love   you more UK but
There were salah and ronaldo but ronaldo magic failed infront of 🇪🇬 Egyptian
I'm upset why we didn't score more goal after 50 minutes 😂😂

After the historic hat-trick in Manchester United, Salah became:-  • The historical top scorer for African players in the English Premier League.  • The first player in the history of the English Premier League to score a hat-trick in Manchester United against Old Trafford.  • The first player in the history of Liverpool to score in 3 consecutive matches in Manchester United against Old Trafford.  • The first player in the history of Liverpool to score in 10 consecutive matches.  • The top scorer in the English Premier League for the current season so far.  The best player in the world right now 🇪🇬👑

Liverpool showed some mercy for United in the second half
hahahahahaha....bye bye cr7!!!!!
The first incident that caused the 1st goal where Maguire moved into the space of McTomminay? Why did he have to do that? Second goal occurred when Maguire bumped into Luke Shaw and pushed him?  A captain making cartoonish errors ... what a joke
Emyu nieh senggol dong boss 🤣🤣
Theater of Joke
Keita should have done that Cantona look celebration. Lmao
Salah Amazing
Salah best player in world 🔥💪🏽

Olle must stay, if Man United  was the winners on Sunday  than the coach would have been labeled as the best, we don't need a new coach at Man United
I watched this a thousand time

Walaupun MU kalah, tapi tetap sema ngat nonton karena ada CR7

ربنا يوفقك يا احلي محمد صلاح
Klopp is an elite manager coming from an United fan
gg salah
Man U is the best but nice Liverpool
Kok saya senang ya 😁😁😁
Man United fans: Ole must be fired! Liverpool: No problem, let me help you with that.  It's a shame that nothing will happen.
😂😂😂😂
Di babak kedua setelah gol ke lima mereka(liverpool) bermain Lebih santai mungkin Klopp takut pemainya mengalami cedera serius sedangkan MU sangat brutal saat laga itu😰😰😰😰
Vietnam 🇻🇳
Alhamdulillah ... salam vlog muslim indonesia

This is a total demolition of Man Utd. Fantastic performance from Salah!

Salah pancen josss tenan,😘😍❤👍
LIVERPOOL INDONESIA
Absolutely embarrassing
nk
Gg
I don't think Man United is that bad. It's just that Liverpool and Man City, these days, are probably the two best teams EVER in the Premier League. Even Ferguson would have struggled.
Wow, cool..but, you..dont..loss..look  chanel  okay bang  👍😅😇
An absolute dismantling- United don’t run half as hard as we do in training…
ربنا يحفظك ويبارك فيك ويحميك يا محمد يا صلاح
Ole game over
Sehr gud Liverpool FIFA
You'll Never Walk Alone
That "Sadio Mane is the best football player in the world" kid would be happy innit?
And it’s five!
Wkwk
Wkwkwkwkkkkk kapok
We are liverpool

LIVERPOOL : WE TOOK EVERYTHING FROM THEM  MANU :😭😭😭😰
Mo Salah! Mo Salah!
I'm impressed by Manchester defence
You know what's the most humiliating about this match? It's that the only highlight Man UTD has is Pogba getting a red.
Kalau mcm ni la cara man utd main...Malaysia pun boleh mkn ni
😆😆🤣🤣💪💪💪5-0
Salah ❤️
Good job m salah
Besttt
shaw was very bad this night
Salah the most clinical striker!
Liverpool 🥰
Liverpool was training in the field in the 2nd half...passing here and there....LMAO. They could have easily scored at least 8 goals in total....but they want to give some face to the red devil for old-time sake.
It seems that United players are deliberately playing Ronaldo out of the game......it looks like they are scared that he will be getting all the limelight.............Rashford is playing very selfish.....It is worthless having the best player in the world, but he never gets the ball...........
ALLAHU AKBAR BARAKALLAH SALAH 🤲🤲
Siiiiiiiiuuuuuuu...
Luar biasa mo salah, jadi suka liverpool gara " Mo salah, keren
We will give back this.... This is devils just remember that... Ggmu❤
most embarrassing game of Manutd ever. Absolutely looked like there was no training and coaching and they also look like hating to play football. Even a street team looks much better in terms of chemistry and understanding of football basics. Manutd and its staffs/players is the biggest scam in football history.
The amazing Mo Salah😍😍 LFC😍
Terimakasih atas kerja keras kalian pantas mendapatkannya. Mantap!
🇹🇷Tebrikler Mohamed Salah 💯
Cool Mohamad Salah!
haha
Good jobs mo n team
MU ez
Manchester united win
Apart from a superb example of how to CRUSH Man Utd in their back yard, something else has caught my eye.  Has anyone else noticed the BBC text service is Biased towards Manchester United? I looked for a few hours after the match for comments and eventually found one at the END of the comments, meaning those comments would disappear first.  I thought journalists were supposed to be IMPARTIAL!
saloh zooooooooooooooooor
حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل تقال هذه الكلمة المباركة في مقامين: مقام طلب المنافع ، ومقام دفع المضار : فمن الأول: قول الله تبارك وتعالى {وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ رَضُوا مَا آتَاهُمُ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَقَالُوا حَسْبُنَا اللَّهُ سَيُؤْتِينَا اللَّهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ وَرَسُولُهُ إِنَّا إِلَى اللَّهِ رَاغِبُونَ} [التوبة: 59] . ومن الثاني: قول الله تبارك وتعالى {الَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ النَّاسُ إِنَّ النَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُوا لَكُمْ فَاخْشَوْهُمْ فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَقَالُوا حَسْبُنَا اللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ (173) فَانْقَلَبُوا بِنِعْمَةٍ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ لَمْ يَمْسَسْهُمْ سُوءٌ وَاتَّبَعُوا رِضْوَانَ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَظِيمٍ} [آل عمران:173-174]. وجُمِعَ الأمران في قول الله عزَّ وجلَّ : {قُلْ أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَادَنِيَ اللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ هَلْ هُنَّ كَاشِفَاتُ ضُرِّهِ أَوْ أَرَادَنِي بِرَحْمَةٍ هَلْ هُنَّ مُمْسِكَاتُ رَحْمَتِهِ قُلْ حَسْبِيَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ يَتَوَكَّلُ الْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ} [الزمر:38]. أي: قل حسبي الله لجلب النعماء ، ولدفع الضرِّ والبلاء فاكثروا منها جزاكم الله خيرا فخيرها عظيم

In 2200, a quiz question might be, when did Coach Klopp’s 200th victory come and what? Future answer: Oh the famous 5-0 in Mu's home where Mo also kicked a hat-trick: :))) It is simply history from now on !!!
Well I guess we could say Salah got his revenge on Ronaldo 4 years ago
Keita >>> kante Liverpool >> chelsea 😁😄😃😀😛🤑🤪😜
Winning 5-0 three weeks in a row, don't bet against it.
Sorry Manchester United
MU deserved it
respect for both lLegend Salah  & Legend CR7
SALAH ❤️

This is the most United team I've ever seen in the past 3 years And also salah > messi n cr7 this season From a sad barca fan 😂😢
Bravo Liverpool....
Amazing effort. Subhanallah.
Bring in Big Sam ,come on United idiot's give him a shot at your big club. If You can give Jose and Ole a go why not big Sam. Or you guys still believe old Fergie can buly the team up the ladder
Question, for men only.. What gives you hope in life? What makes you want to keep going?

Dont forget that Salah is *MUSLIM* Put + if you also *Muslim*
90 million plus £400,000  a week and lasted less than 15mins with brutal school boy tackle! What a waste of money
MU Prank Liverpool..
Salah performance is phenomenal so .got  bad feelings someone gonna injured him soon 😪 . Hope not
Cristiano 🤔
Mancaster united udh terlalau lama tidur. Kapan bangunnya ???
and ronaldo kicked on his belly and slapped that made curtis jones fall on the ground and then he kicked 3 times more when curtis was on the ground. A clear red card
Alhamdulillahh...MO SALAH is the goat
idk how many more times i'm gonna come back here to watch this masterpiece
Looking for penalties ronaldo 🙃🙃
ronaldo 💩
MAMPUSSSSS
The only question I have is why they didn't score more
Ronaldo will take revenge against Liverpool coz he is best at taking revenge 😁😁
Manchester United will come back stronger!!
Лучше один раз проиграть 0:5 Чем два раза подряд 0:1
تحركات محمد صلاح نفس الاسطوره ميسي
What happen with anfield? Why you all practice at old trafford?
Ole stayyyyy
I'm still here, to see the history being made. this was the kind of match fans gonna swear on.  what a time to be alive when you when you wake up as a Liverpool fan but then you're an Indian 🥲

HHaha Man U invested to much up front and nothing in back
Mo egy king
Who ever said let's sign Salah than went and got him they deserve a million pound bonus.
Rip Man united😥😥😥
This match was almost like a training session for Liverpool. Man United's defence was absolutely poor and a lot of mistakes were made and salah and others didn't hesitate to make them pay for it. Very wonderful passes and goals from Liverpool and though I'm not a fan but I loved this gameplay from them💓💓
See u in March @Liverpool FC red devils will be waiting 😈😈
The first goal summed the game up liverpool get the ball and running past man utd defense like there asleep

Singaporeans be like: 5 kosong pratas

Its now legitimately arguable that liverpool is the strongest team in the PL and CL. One could also argue that Liverpool has the strongest offense as well. Lets summarize their accomplishments so far in both leagues.  Liverpool is undefeated in the "Group of Death" in the Champions League. But that is not all. In 3 games, theyve scored 11 goals! That is two more than the rest of the teams in the group combined! The only other team to have scored more is Bayern who, as you know, is in a much weaker group.   In the Premier League, Liverpool is undefeated, ranked 2nd and trailing Chelsea by one point. Liverpool have also scored at least 3 goals in every one of the last 10 matches which is one of the reasons I think they have the strongest offense. And theyve actually scored 5 goals in 3 of the last 4 matches. As a side note, there has been at least one gorgeous/magnificent goal in the last 5 matches.
P
Mo Salah is currently the best player in the world....the present G.O.A.T☆☆☆
Yes yes liverpool fc for life bwoy get Big 5
All the dislikes is from manunited fans
How bad MU defense is🤔🤔🤔
❤️❤️👍🏼
Ternyata MU lebih bagus 10 pemain tidak kebobolan dri pada 11 pemain sampai kebobolan 5😂
Mans defenders are just running sheep 🐑, they are doing nothing but running 🏃
England national team would be feeling like huh Salah should have come from our root
It's shame penaldo.
Udah, semakin trending semakin malu nih mereka.
Liverpool Indonesia mn nih

Maguire and Shaw, England defenders.   All five goals are on their mistakes.   Fun to watch on Liverpool while disastrous on watching these defenders.
SALAH "you'll never walk alone"

Where is your Ronaldo
Arsenal fan here your team was hella good hate the fact that y’all parked the bus tho wanted you guys to score at least 3 more goals..... as for Man U I’m just gonna say that Pogba understood the assignment👌🏽

I personally think Keane or Scholes or Neville should be hired as MU manager and see what those blowhards can do besides being backseat drivers with a loud bull horn.  I'm not making excuse for Solskjaer or suggesting keeping him but I especially hate those 3 smartass with the loudmouth.

Mohammad Salah is really humble compare to Ronaldo.. i choose Salah as my hero
Look how Fred react in the first goal.
I wish liverpool should continue performing like this. Consistent is what they need if they have to compete with likes of City and Chelsea for a title

That was a good welcome back to EPL CR7 moment. Brilliant game.
The golden ball for Salah and remember my words
الحارس والدفاع خونه
How can anyone dislike this wonderful performance
Mo Salah ♥️🔥
MU ronaldo👎😂😂😂
Alex Ferguson made Manchester United what it is, but since him, the rest have made it much less than when he left.
OMG!! That Maguire is really horrible defending, so indecisive and slow, its unbelievable that he was involved in 4 of  the 5 goals and 3 were definitely his fault... 🤷‍♂️
Thanks loverpool, am united fan but i have to congrates you people, my people are still thinking of 1999 treble as if they are the only team did that, me i don't like nonsence
It's hurting that the reds start forgetting Sadio mane
Cr7 always the Best!!
I'm gonna be a Muslim like Salah
Incredible Mo Salah. The Next Liverpool legend
Did Cristiano Pedaldo cry? 😢 😿
Manchester United outclass for Liverpool
Was Ronaldo playing in that game ?

Why Ole should stay at United 1- Best manager they've had since SAF 2- Smiles better than kante even after a loss 3- Starts my idol Fred regularly 4- Is a United legend and has the United DNA Ole deserves a new 5 year contract at United
Hope this talk of missing Gini will be put to rest now. Midfield has purpose and a flow now that was lacking with Gini starting every game. This team has every chance of winning trophies for fun.
I think Liverpool showed respect to the MU fans. They could’ve scored more goals
Where's Cristina? 😂😂

the only sad thing about this for Liverpool is Keita is on fire, scoring in consecutive matches but now he is injured again..
I still laugh at £80M Maguire on the 5th goal, where the hell he was looking at? Henderson passed the ball to Salah on the right side n he, Maguire just running straight while still looking at left side until a very last 2nd before Salah making a goal..lol..what a great defender he is
😂😂Salah roasting CR7
McGuire might be the most overplayed player in the history football Hw really sucks at defending...
Great Job SALAH , we all hope this season being the best one & still smashing records 🔥👏♥♥
De gea is so bad not sure why Man U continues to keep him he has not been a top 5 goalie in forever
I never get bored watching this video

Give Salah everything he wants and let him stay till the end of his football career, he deserves everything 🔥🔥.
Allez Liverpool
It was so bad I could not even feel ashamed being long-time United supporter. But remember 1:6 loss to City, it was also end of October... so caps down to Liverpool, thank them for having stopped playing afer the fifth goal and look forward to the next game, hopefully without that misunderstanding Harry whoever-guire.
Mo Salah: hoy amanecí re loco!👌😎 🇪🇬

This is a Red Nose. Manchester/2 = 5.
Most memorable match of the season for now. Pretty sure Roberto Firmino brought in all his buddies from the Brazil national soccer team to celebrate this win (if you know what I mean... #5 , the lucky number)
Koplok MU
When you play fifa on medium mode
اللهم صل على محمد وعلى آل محمد وأحسن عاقبتنا يا الله. كثرت الفتن واختلط الأمر على عبادك وصاروا حيارى. اللهم اصلح حالنا وأرشدنا إلى ما فيه الخير واصرفنا عما فيه الشر . أشفق على حالنا واجعل لنا ما يرشدنا.

Great game Liverpool over Manchester United 5.0 wow
Menang juga
Mo salah 🇪🇬🇪🇬🖤
Damn Im a ManU fan 😭😭😭😭
Liverpool reset exception
It is good that we have depth of midfielders but it’s only the ninth game and one after another got sidelined through injury. Elliot, Thiago, Milner, Keita. We just got Curtis back from one. It’s time for Alex to step up.  Keita played on the right seems to get more involved.
Most beautiful football... 😍LIVERPOOL.
i like it

We have 5.5k dislike we know who is 5.5k 🤣🤣

Absolutely classic performance by Liverpool. Did Harry Maguire actually cost £80m?? 😳 No way I'll sign him for even £30m... hw was just a total mess in this game with tens of timeless runs

Ok.... I'm watching from away.
and to think they could have done a lot more
Liverpool literally turned Old Trafford  into a library!
Salah for the gold?whi not?
Salah so far: Appearances: 12 Goals: 15 Assists: 5  Ronaldo so far:  Appearances 9 Goals 6 Assists 0 (he never passes)  We can see who the real GOAT is
mo . salah the king and the best
I think the Man U players are tired of their coach. Player do it a lot.. it's like when a a child in elementary school is not doing too well academically, the parents might want to use the opportunity to put the blame on the teacher. In most cases, the students might have been tired of the teacher or don't like his attitude for one reason or the other. That's exactly what I saw okay out in this match. There was no motivation at all from the Man U team.
Pepes goreng
I love salah I love Liverpool
if liverpool defeated man u it would be easy for chelsea to defeat man u
Mohammad Salah is the best player in the world 🌎 🙌

Bella lezione a Cristiano, così almeno non si monta troppo la testa..credeva di aver lasciato la Juventus per una squadra più propizia alle sue esigenze..adesso si può accontentare di questa squadretta del Manchester United.
Wow hat-trick to big enemy..

ما اعظم الامور مصيبه بان يدرب اليونايتد لاعب كان في هذا النادي هههههههه يجب علئ الحمقى ان يستنزلوا ولو عاطفه ان يأتوا بمدرب مستقل لم يلعب كره القدم قط ويملك شهاده
I wish you’d show the time in the game on these clips.. it would tell the viewer when each goal happend and at what point in the game
How sad
Highest Paid Players in Premier League (Salary Per Week)  1- Cristiano Ronaldo £510,000 2- Kevin De Bruyne £400,000 3- David de Gea £375,000 4- Jadon Sancho £350,000 5- Raphael Varane £340,000 6- Romelu Lukaku £325,000 7- Jack Grealish £300,000 8- Raheem Sterling £300,000 9- N’Golo Kante £290,000 10- Paul Pogba £290,000 I don't see Mohamed Salah here 🤔 I got confused.. Do those players in this list pay to their's clubs or the club pay them?
Suiii
MoSalah.... Ronaldo's worst nightmare
coom on man utd
Not Ronaldo's fault
Cr7 return is probably a nightmare for Man U  How could Liverpool beat such a star studded side by 5 smh
Ahahah good very good

โรนัลโด้ เล่นบอลวิ่งไม่ไหวหรือขี้เกียจวิ่งกันแน่ เล่นแบบรอส้มหล่นอย่างเดียว แบบนี้มันเอาเปรียบเพื่อนร่วมทีม แก่แล้ว วิ่งไม่ไหวก็ควรแขวนสตัคดีกว่า
Luke Shaw he has no speed 😂
Ole out Ole out  Ole out  Go go go
1:31 Que passe monstruoso e a categoria do Salah,que jogada incrível...
What a deservingly satisfying win! I hope the other coach will not get the sack and let the team continues to rot deeper and further!
Merah yang sesungguhnya
Its time that everyone should know that Ronaldo has to retire right now. He is not at his prime. It's time that Man United Fans should boo him in every single match he will be playing. (Hope Every Man United Fans and Ronaldo sees this.)
MU=NOR
Manchester zawsze spierdo@& kupon

المو صلاح ضرب اليونايتد والدون يتحسر هاذا ايام صلاح التاريخيه
We all know this would happen. I dont understand why the managwr still is there. Replaxe him or let ronaldo coach or something. Or let him be but not be in charge. You cannot have pogba and cavani and ronaldo and lose 5 0.replace the coach now.
Mo Salah mo Salah mo Salah..
Did anyone notice after scoring first goal three Liverpool players raised their hands at the same time
That Henderson pass gat me
Salam 5 Jari.  Eeeeeeh 0-5 maksudnya 😂😂😂
5k dislike from M U. But is still 5x0.
Salah was mad because Firmino got a hat-trick before him, so he clutched it up on a bigger game

Bye bye ole
When Liverpool was leading 5-0 with 30 minutes remaining, they were not thinking of scoring more to humiliate the 10 men Man United. That’s a kind move of Liverpool….well done.
How did this happen with Ronaldo on the starting line. What! 🤯😭😭😱
You must show how the opponent’s “king” kicked our people.

Liverpool is miles ahead of their mid- table  team.
Not giving red card to Ronaldo is racism! He intentionally hit Liverpool player on his stomach and put him down on the ground. Absolutely brutal, disrespectful and deserves 3 red cards!
Salah, I don’t have any more words to describe the best player in the world and the continue record breaker. On fire🔥, apart from him exceptional team work from every individual player. And Bobby is back in the best trio-MSF of Liverpool form more strong and creative. Love my dear club & we are the RED -YNWA

It should be 6 or 7, so it will be  memorable. As klop said in CL let's talk about 6 so will have double meaning. Henderson assists is priceless.

محمد صلاح انت علامة فارقة فى تاريخ الكرة المصرية والعربية والإفريقية. مثال حقيقى للاعب المجتهد والبسيط والمتواضع والمميز جدا. تستحق الكرة الذهبية عن جدارة وها هى الايام دارت وفزت على الكبير جدا كريستيانو رونالدو ورفاقه فى عقر دارهم " الاووولد ترافورد". كم أنت كبير يا صلاح !!! 👏✌️💕🌹🥳
I'm here before the video reach 10 mil

Ruthless indeed 😂💪
Mo Salah is making history as the greatest African, Egyptian player ever. He deserves to be at the topest and to receive The Ballon d'Or 👏✌️💕🌹🥳
This match reminded me of Barca vs Real Madrid (5-0) when RM players were just showing violence as they were losing.

สะใจโว้ย!
That assist from Henderson🤑🤑
Maguire is the weakest link in MU team now. He’s unable to defend and is slow, also unable to read the game. Take him off the team.
Liverpool deserved the victory they have been better than us in every department!' Congratulations to you....as for us fans' all we say is 'Ole Out!!!!

Ole is a former MU striker..he is good at scoring goals but not defending..thats why Liverpool can score so many goals and at old Trafford..so sad😔
"Ole is the best manager for MU post Ferguson"  -Liverpool fans.
Mntep m salah  From indonesia
Common where is ronaldo's kick performance.
As a united fan, all I’m gonna say is that you deserved the win today. Ole didn’t even start our strongest squad which annoyed me considering that you are no doubt one of the best teams in Europe.

What a depressing depressing game...... Absolutely pathetic from the Reds..... Y'all shoulda listened to Paul Scholes after the Atalanta game!
I am a LFC fan... But have to say it... This away jersey colour is stupid....  Man Utd have to get rid of Balotelli. Pogba is the new Balotelli... So lazy... Why Man Utd spending money for the sake of spending?? Spend big on quality players who will fight for Man Utd every sec

I also seen that the defence didn't allowed Ronaldo to touch the ball many times. The one time got the ball went inside the net. Liverpool was lucky that refree gave it a offside.

Ronaldo must have been sent out as well. His kicks in the stomach of the liverpool player proved not only on the pitch but also in human values and spirits Ronaldo is miles behind lionel messi. Ronaldo is a showman with little to offer

Manchester seperated , not united 🤦🏼
That MAN U defense sucks. Why buy Varane and not use him?. And Fred, I'm pretty sure he is Ole's long lost son. Like come on, you have world class players sitting on the bench. Use them FFS.

Emyu? Akwokwowkwokwowk
I just re-watched this video over 100 times. Can't get over the madness we created at their own backyard ❤️
Красавцы !
If you watch the full game you will hear Robertson saying “keep going, keep going” after celebrating the 5th goal lol. Man didn’t want to stop bullying poor Man United.

👏👏👏👏👂👂👂
what a match is is
Mohamed Salah is the pride of the Arabs
Ole out.. Ronaldo out.. De Gea out.. Martial out.. Fred out.. Pogba out in Juventus..
Why ??? 0-5  Why ..why ..why
So many people turned out to see Liverpool's training session
Mo Salah is an absolute genius on the pitch he is on fire , I still wonder why he is not yet giving a ballon' dor crown?, Come on FIFA do something .
Liverpool isthebest... Mo salah 👍👍👍
Get well soon Naby Lad, you stood up.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👌
tanda liverpool juara lagi
What a player, what a team!
If no red card, it would have been 10-nil easily
Knock, Knock you about to get shell shocked ⚡. YNWA97 . Mo Salah, hat-trick hero!
Love it!!! You lucky bastards what a stunning win. Light years better than my beloved Leeds and evidently beyond those scum bastards. So pleased for you.
<3
poor manchester united like a useless clown in epl. Since the arrival of ronaldo like not a team
1:19 look keita he already celebrated before salah scored that is confidence for mo salah he is the best in the world right now
Amazing team 😍
very good moment
I dont speak chinesisch i speak argentin but not chinesisch
Wow... I really respect to Egypt now.. M.Salah (Soccer) and Big Ramy (Mr.Olympia) are G.O.A.T
Proud  to you Salah your are  arabs pride
Maguire starts for england as well..smh
nightmare for MU 🤣🤣🤣  Liverpool is the best team  in the world
<······················>
محمد صلاح كان كبوس في المطش
Absolutely beautiful from Henderson
nobody talk about assist from hendo was exactly like the one stevie G did for sturridge?
I'm really happy because liverpool out of the winner😍
menang itu bersyukur seperti m salah.bukan sombong dan minta di senggol !
Mohammed salah is better than Christian ronaldo 😅
0:48
henderson❤️ my idol
aston villa 7 - 2 liverpool
United defense easy as pie 🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧
masterpiece
Sala ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ronaldo likes revenge be ready 😈
What a performance!!
Good refereeing. Normally there would not even be a booked Manu player for those fouls, and some Liverpool goals would have been stopped due to offside, and United was given onside...
Even my manager mode on PES still do better then this
Oh my god  Ronaldo is really back 😱😱😱😱😱... FORZAAA JUVEEEEEE JUVEEEEEE JUVEEEEEE 😂😂😂😂😂
What a pass from Hendo!
Unpopular(?) Theory: Mo Salah is actually an ancient egyption god who saw football and fell in love with it, reincarnated in sweet Mohammad Salah. Cause THAT can't be human...
hat trick in an away match against the great team. wow
What an awful commentary 😳
SAALAHH IS THE KINGGG
WE DID A GREAT GREAT JOBBBB
impossible
And united thought they were going to win the league, hilarious 🤣😂😆 Easy W 🚩🚩🚩
What a performance from Pogba LOL
SIUUMMM
Fred really enjoy his jogging
Munyuk otw puasa gelar lagi🤣
Oh wow , That seemed so easy to win 5-0 every week 😅
That sprint Mohammad Salah did in his 1st goal between Man Utd defenders, is it something we see everyday? He is a genius man.
Maguire worst defender i have ever seen 🤦
Absen dulu. Ada ilham, Ada fahri, Ada kurniawan, Ada deddy, Ada corbuzier.
For decades, Man Utd fans have said that Liverpool can only win by a small team.  When I believed after we won today
Thank you liverpool
Ronaldo 5 pappine e a casaaa hahahahahah
Congratulations on our achievement and keep up the good work. Mohamaed Salah has now been directly involved in 17 goals so far this season:    ◎ 12 games   ◎ 15goals   ◉ 5 assists   He's only failed to score or assist in *one* appearance. 🤯   🔥 Hat-trick for Salah! 5-0    Mohamed Salah is the first player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick against Man Utd at Old Trafford.    Mo Salah's 107th Premier League goal sees him pass Didier Drogba as the highest-scoring African in league history 🇪🇬👑
You will never walk alone wow
Salah on a red hot form
The reason as to why we are playing to such a high level, is simple. After what happened to us last season, when injuries destroyed our form (plus the coronavirus too), we are now determined to make up for all of that.  We want that title back. And, by God, we are gonna win it - plus the Champions League too.
The Reds is Liverpool🔥
Keita incredible
Sad m.u
FORZA LIVERPOOL 🔴🔵
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Mo Salah..I mean mister goal ....with salah never walk alone
Mo Salah is currently the best player in the world.⭐👑
That pass from Henderson omg!
What a game!!!
You've got to make these highlights of atleast 8 mins.
Norwich played better than utd against liverpool
Laura Liverpool tatti team ....ole out 😤😤
5-0. Fact.
That flick from Henderson to gift Salah his hatrick is underrated
Someone cry in the bed corner
Yesterday we bought united to their limits so all the utd fans can now shut their mouths
Md salah ❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤❤️
Salah and Lukaku better than Ronaldo
As of now, the view is  5,155,555 views  LOL!!!!

BRAVO...
DIOGO JOTO THE LIVERPOOL'S TIMORATA(G.O.AT)
Sensasional👏
where is manes fans who so much hate salah
5 goals in 2 match...5 goals in 5Day... Goat man Goat Man!! 🇾🇪Salah
Kasian Ronaldo di penghujung karir malah dengan tim lawak
Salah was more than great , but Jurgan klopp made a touch of magic when he let fermino free to move wherever he wants , Klopp you are great
Alhamdulillah. Great job Mohammed Salah and Liverpool...keep hustle always.
Forza liverpool by milan s fan
Salah🔥🔥🔥
INDONESIA ❤️🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Maguire 🤡
Mo Salah👑
That red card wasn't necessary
This has to be one of Liverpool's worst performance in years. How could they not score more then 5 goals against a mediocre side like Man Utd? The way some of the Liverpool strikers, such as Jota, Keita, Firmino and even Alexander Arnold and Robertson were missing the mark with only De Gea to beat on one to one situation is absolutely unforgiveable. The only player who gave a decent performance was Mo Salah, who rightfully should have helped himself to six or seven goals instead of only 3. If i were Klopp, i will not hesitate to replace these bungling Liverpool strikers and give others a chance to proved their worth. Hope he will make the changes in Liverpool's next match against  more tougher opposition, Brighton.
fans emyu nangis di pojokan
Old Trafford should be named Mo Slaha Stadium from today...
Good job Liverpool eased off in the second half it would have been double figures
สุดยอดมากครับ
That defense is spot on....jezzz....
Henderson’s assist was sick
MAN UNITED 😂😂😂😂
Bubuk
He wants 400k pw ? The way he’s playing I’d give him that per day
What do Watford and Manu have in common? Exactly they both lost 5-0 to Liverpool ❤😂😂
Am sure the haters are united fans. Mo just too good, keita as well.
Never walk alone
Stunning salah simply superb
Liverpool r very generous they wanted to beat man UTD 11 vs 11. I say these bcoz after Red card Liverpool stop scoring.  They didn't want pple start saying ooo we were 10 vs 11. Bt Man utd the biggest problem is Ronaldo.
(before game)Mo Salah : tonight we are gonna had a bigmatch.. (After game) Mo Salah : so its just sparring training i guess .. 😁
Loooooool laala !!!!!! Mohamed Salah is empire of the game he is the Egypt talent many wishes for him gooood Luke haaaá
We deserve the victory... proud to be liverpool😊😊😊
Liverpool ❤️
Salah deserves Ballon d'or.
CR7 should have seen a red card as well.
Who else has to come here because Man United YouTube channel won’t post this
So lovely 😊
Mo Salah is back to his absolute best . There was a period of time when he tried too much to prove that his best season wasn’t a one-off and he can be consistently good like Messi and Ronaldo. He was virtually trying to score from impossible angles and not passing to teammates in better position . Now ,he is back to the good old Salah with incredible amount of assists and goals , just like his previous best season . This shows that he just have to be himself and goals will come naturally . I’m so happy for him - YNWA
🤣🤣🤣
Cr7 oombi
Five wow
🇪🇬 🔥
Rip for those  who was said community posts that man utd would win
Quick 5
Mosalah❤️
humiliation
amazing
What a shame 😢😢😢
Everyone tells me that man u are better than liverpool after I watched that game I got to bully them all 😂
Saya kira ini tayangan ulang VS Watford...ternyata saya salah..
Fantastic game from Liverpool !! YNWA !!

The first goal was a masterpiece. Cut through the defence like hot knife through butter
SALAH LOVE FROM PAKISTAN 🇵🇰
According to their existential philosophy, Manchester United has no defense 😅
1 assist 3 goal
Mohammed Salah scoring hattrick against Devil's club that's why his Mohammed Salah for reason
Wonderful teamwork by great team  MU just look like a ball boys..
Salah owns the prem right now.
slaughtered.wkwkwk
Goo Liverpool pepet chelsea 🔥🔥🔥
Man utd has 5 times ball'on de'or winner CR7  we have the priceless Mo Salah. 🇧🇩
Ancur
I don't get it, one of the most lethal striker in the world now, but they didn't even bother to mark him, but Salah's team mates , the whole team is amazing too
The goal celebration of Liverpool fc shows that they are a complete team with understanding and happy for each other when somebody scores a goal..... they play together and celebrate together..
Man Ronaldo did not do his best and Salah did do his best
😂😂😂😂😂✊
Liverpool really respected ronaldo, they score 5 goal for five ballon d'or that ronaldo had for tribute
Saleh did to Manchester what he did to Rome. Great work goo Liverpool.
Nasib baik real madrid tak ambik degea
Im wake up and Youtube gave me this notification "wow beautiful trending for Liverpool🔴"

Utd fans: When the unexpected becomes the expected, and the insane becomes the predictable... Innit?   If what i typed, it's wrong... U know what i mean anyway.
Mohammed Salah absolutely ruthless 🇪🇬👑
MU have six defender in the box.. Really bad defence..
We all know who is the real man of the match. HARRY MAGUIRE 🥰🥰... love to thank him for creating 3 golden chances for us 🤣🤣

Worry about status of Keita!!! Hope not serious
To be perfectly honest, Liverpool  could have played a little better. Some sloppy passes and then Klopp told the players to calm down after Pogba was sent off because he didnt want to humiliate United.
Naby keita.. keep it up👍
What a team red's
Maguire defence and captaincy 🤡🤡
Get Salah that new contract asap
Thank you Salah for your 24pts I knew you were going to distory  United that’s why I had no doubt you would be my captain for MW 9.
Salah  now is in the Premier League history  ! 3 goals  at Old Trafford: incredible  Mo  .... go Reds  !!!
Incredible Mo Salah...from Liverpool Fans Indonesia.
Maguire still looking for Salah 🤣🤣🤣
Massive Massive statement of intent by the redmen. They know we were denied an open top bus parade, so they gonna win it again.   ...but I genuinely feel sorry for united. Talented players, club with great history. It snot nice when a big club gets humiliated. we have been there.
Olle outttttttt
Ternyata doa salah lebih manjur dri pogba
Seems like Old Trafford has become a playground for Liverpool
Hendo passing very amazing 👏🏼👏🏼. Liverpool Comeback 🔥🔥
Cr7 is best.

Liverpool are a great team and what a performance. Utd should have played pogba van de beek farandos in deep midfield role so they protect defence.ole is clueless.
Forever Salah Forever OGS
Salah deserves everything he wants. We've got a close squad that can achieve greater things now that they're well into their prime. We just need to resolve a few issues about our injury crisis apart from that we are in for a bumpy ride.

Time to go Ole
Another lovely weekend. Amazing
Ole just like lampard the seat is to big he got all the players to win evrythng but he can't use them it's like giving someone a 4x4 with all diff locks,low range and everything and  take him to sandy place or mudy road and tell the person  to drive he will definitely stuck because he doesn't know how to drive it in those conditions so the problem is not the car but the man behind the wheel  Ole
siapa yang di sini nonton berkali kali?
C Ronaldo is going to Liverpool this year
Umtiti 🔥
Quelle humiliation ? CR7😂😂😂
🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴!
Salah is presently the best player in the world.
They should have stopped the game after half time because the 2nd half they did nothing and was boring.
So Muhammad means praise-worthy..and salah means prayer...so hes praise-worthy prayer???

That last pass was ridiculous
well done Liverpool champions again this year ..
SALAH SIAPA? 😁✌️💪
What a Beautifull goal 👏
*I thought that Mo Salah was frustrated last season when separated between him and  Harry Kane by one goal for the top scorer in Premier League* *But this man is indifferent ،Always Continuous , Amazing*
Salaaaaaaaah
Ini tidak normal😡 aku rasa ada yg harus di pertanyakan atas gol2 itu. Liverpool ternyata mesin pembunuh
yuk bisa yuk masuk goa😅
Fun fact: Man U were favorites to win
If Salah misses out on player of the month again.  I think all the Liverpool fans need to protest.
"Solskjaer admits he's still the right man for the job"  Couldn't agree more as a Liverpool fan.

Moh salah...the best.
Varane and Bailly can do a lot better. Maguire needs to be dropped for at least 5 games. Lindelof is okay but still he should be dropped for 2 games in order for Bailly to get match time
Poor defending from Man U 😡
I'm so happy to Liverpool, I love Liverpool 🥰🥰🥰⭐⭐
outstanding from Liverpool
United did worse than Watford
God day
The Egyptian 🤴 👑 King did it once again ..
Maguire is nothing but a meme material, almost all goals from his side 😂😂😂😂
ManU's defence was just embarrassing. That's like watching 5 y o defending. 😂😂😂
oleout
Umiliato Ronaldo
All the goals were scored  from the right side which means that the defence on that side was  like a strainer. Not only that , the  defence was nearly inexistant.  SHAME ON THE TEAM AND THE COACH  .PLAYERS LIKE MAGUIRE, POGBA, FRED AND OTHERS NEED TO BE SACKED FORTHWITH. If they have an iota of shame , they should not take their salary as they cannot be paid for doing nothing.WILL THE AUTHORITIES TAKE NOTE.?
The most beautiful thing in this mach assist Henderson
LIVERPOOLL
Maguire is really lost.
Adakah orang kita disini
I saw this fixture in 2017. 1-1, Milner penalty. I see Milner is still going, amazing
This week Liverpool fans seems so happy because, Everton and Manchester United Lose in a same week (include me)

Damn poor cristiano, Manchester’s defenders are so bad and too damn slow…. That dude harry the captain didn’t even try. He was just standing there lol.
Phenomenal scoreline, brilliant performance and our best away kit in a long while. What a time to be alive

Salah owns CR lmfao.
That Hendo -> Salah pass had echo's of a certain Gerrard -> Torres pass
OLE THIS OLE THAT... no one talks about how good the whole LFC Team gels and play in every single department and what a pass by Hendo! Lastly, the tackles united players make? or even CR7 who is a world football icon that makes that kick against Curtis, 19-year-old... COME ON, the red cards and amt of yellow cards? Surely there needs to be a cap?   oh wells, We keep going till we win the PREMIER LEAGUE AND UCL, FA CUP, LEAGUE CUP. VAMOS!
Fair play! We deserved to lose! Our tactics were terrible and Ole has to go. Well Done Mo Salah for scoring a hattrick at Old Trafford
Lets give Salah the ballon dor already
YAA ALLAH... PLEASEE GIVE MOHAMMED SALAH TO MAN CITY PLEASEEEE 🙏🙏🙏
M.salah one of the best player in the world
Hendo's ball to Salah world class

I LOVE TO SEE RONALDO LOST FROM  COMPETITION.  🇮🇩  REMEMBER NOBODY PERSON CAN ALWAYS GETTING PERFECT.  SOMETHING WRONG MUST HAPPEN AND YOU SHOULD PREPARE  IT.
Mo salah, mo salah, mo salah Running down the wing Salah.. la...la...la...la Egyptian king
Thanks to Ole,Fred,Maguire,And Shaw
Talk about a fact that sounds too absurd to be true. Mo Salah today just became the first player to score a Premier League hat trick at Old Trafford as a visitor.
pertahanan MU sejak gk ada Ferdinan,G heinze,Nemanja Vidic dan G nevile rapuh gmpg hebol gol rata2 kena serang dari sayap kanan..Mndg pgl Ferguson j lg benahin MU
Luk Shaw was absolutely magnificent
nothing feels better than seeing Gaychester united getting trashed.
so will he got player of the month now?? 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️

Even  the school children can do better than man utd'defence

MOH SALAH MOH SALAH MOH SALAH
Manchester has 1 star and LFC has 11 stars.   Its a team. LFC have no individuals stars and that's why we win.
Liverpool as a united fan I say good job. But next time we will shamble you to the ground. How dare you come to our stadium and sing songs like that. By the way it was not a red card for Ronaldo. No way Ronaldos challenge was a red. Only the first he kicked him but then he kicked the ball
Menang di upload kalah diem bae
Liverpool nih, senggol donk !!!
Salah best player in the world
I m a man u fan,actually ,ole should thanks kloop for teaching him how to upgrade as a manager.   From here we can see theres totally lack of experience in ole.    Kloop tell and show him..     U got a good player high class player..but olee...,i m sorry u are not up to my standard yet..    From here ,take this as a lesson.     Stop ur egoistic as a manager ,trust a player ..   Who u can trust ..    Thank you liverpool.     Ole should play .      Tom heaton       Bailly        Alexis.     Liderloff      Bissaka. Matip/mata/van de beek. Bruno,sancho.   Ronaldo/ martial/ cavanni
We will remember this until the time the doomsday is coming.
they did it against leiceter too, shaw and mcguire should not be seen defending side by side; they make each other weaker. shaw is freequently caught out of position, macguire is outpaced many times.
10 years i become united fans now i am fans liverpool ,i like beuty football
I love Salah's down to earth behaviour........Congs over your Hattrick
Manchester is Blue💙

Here's a sobering thought for LFC supporters ( with memory loss :)  ASTON VILLA 7 ( YEAH SEVEN ) LIVERPOOL 2 .... OCTOBER 4TH 2020. Manager JK and pretty much the same team as yesterday . That's one year and twenty days ago .
Mo salah deserve the balls d'Or this year
Can we agree that Luke Shaw had one of the worst performances ever. Him and Maguire. Absolutely terrible.
Mo KING 👑❤️👑❤️👑❤️
what a performance . 5-0 at their own backyard man😂
One game to remember 🤩
Man United defenders thinking like this is  training match of CR7😂
Mohamad Salah mantab
Nice salah
Hey clowns if you sack ollie steve bruce will be a good choice .lol great manager you know ..howay 5-0 .
ronaldo should of gotten a red card because he kicked him 4 times
THOUGHT MAN UTD WILL GIVE A GOOD MATCH BUT THEY HAVE OLE WHO DOES NOT NEED TO PROVE HIS EXCELLENCE SALAH IS THE GOAT NOW I HAVE TO SAY CURRENT GOAT 🐐 AND POGBA RED CARD WAS VERY WRONG IT WAS IN THE BALL
LIVERPOOL ❤
Just love everything about this team. Hard work ethic. Not afraid to play tough,  while playing fair. And they take it straight to the fucking house every opportunity they get. From the defense to the offense, everyone is working in conjunction and it is so beautiful
MU need Zidane not Ole
Good team work  Bad tactics from Ole  See you in ur next club  Greetings from the pearl of Africa
I am not sure why MU bought Mcguire. He does not fit to MU squad since he is slow and dumb..
Congratulations!!!
Luka shaw ngapain wkwk
This was a huge defeat or as Paul Scholes describes it "The Feet"
🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🇮🇩
Dear Manchester, India feels your pain. We got hammered by Pakistan on the same day
do we have defenders?
United made everybody happy 😃
It's so shameful on the legend Ronaldo to play like a small kid with no sportsmanship, embarrassing and got a yellow card for that child like behavior.. disappointment and ofc u get what u deserve van dijk and konate bullied the bully's back..Don't mess with people who has sportsmanship and infect felt bad and decided not to score furthermore to give chance and they started their training session on the ground after the 5th goal. Proud of YNWA for showing mercy.
Manchester, if they come to Missy and Mambape with Ronaldo, it wouldn't be the wonderful team. The administration is bad
What a time to shine naby keita 🇬🇳🇬🇳
A good team Liverpool
Mampusssssss...hahahaha
MANCHESTER IS BLUE!!! C'MON LIVERPOOL GO CRUSH UTD
Let varane play yaar😑😑
Salah is unstoppable
Liverpool has Luck....next we'll triumph
😍😍😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
luke shaw and Maguire are the weakest link.
I hate the fact that when ronaldo plays the other teams get motivated more and more, but he defeated all of them in his time and has 3 PL titles, that’s why they are mad happy, now he’s 36 what do expect him to do, although he managed to score a beauty.
Congratulations to Liverpool for beating Manchester United 5-0 at Old Trafford. Mohammed Salah played well in this match.
yess...this is a TIME....yahuuuuu
They were so bad I almost thought they were throwing the game😂😂😂
With Ole at the helm, Manchester United will not going anywhere, they are far behind Liverpool, Chelsea, and even Manchester City, Leicester now chasing them, so poor for CR7, the REAL G.O.A.T who move from Juventus to worst club and coach like Manchester United, he did not desserved this, sack this Ole man, he just too radicolous
#🤣lestay
I.m really happy What an assist from endorson❤️🔥
Where's the highlight from MU 🤭
Maguire is a huge joke
LET'S GO REDS 🔴, WELL PLAYED
افضل لاعب في العالم حاليا...محمد صلاح بلا منازع

Happy  momentfor the redmachine.

For all 5 goals Maguire and Shaw were at fault. They were awful.
This is really a shocking loss by man utd
As a man united fan i'm mad but also not because we lost to the team that's gonna win the title cause damn that liverpool team is cracked.
Ole IN.
EZ Liverpool,,,🥳🥳🎉
Pertandingan yg sangat luar biasa

من يصدق ان فريقاً به كريستيانو رونالدو و بوغبا و راشفولد و برونو يدخل به خمسة أهداف؟ 😲
penaldo no effect ,used only at pinalti
Now i see why Liverpool fans are backing ole. .
Menurut hemat saya sebagai mantan seorang bidan bayi..., Ada baiknya kalo pemain pemain EMYU melupakan sepak bola dan mulai fokus pada penerimaan CPNS untuk formasi pegawai kementrian thn 2022. Timbangane bal balan yo mung kalah wae. Malah tombok kon mbayari sewa lapangan karo njajakke bakso pemain tim lawan.
What. I should to say. Believe or not  this is true good job salah
10 Reasons Ole should be retained:   1. His puzzle tactics make opponents and players confused  2. Having Fred as the best Deep Playmaker, whose Passing often confuses Enemies and Friends.  3. Having Martial as the best Target Man, who often wastes opportunities.  4. Having Maguire as the Best Central Defender, who often passes to opponents and keeps friends on his own.  5. Having Lingardinho, One of the Best Players in the World.  Who can pass to friend and foe to become a goal.  6. Can present 000 trophies in the last 4-5 years.  7. Have a smile that makes your opponent happy.  Even when you lose, keep smiling.  8. Football fans, both opponents and friends, really love Ole  9. Very Humble, when a lot of blasphemy hits always smile and smile  10. Ole is handpicked by club legends who make management believe 1000% in the process.  Hopefully it will last another 10-20 years as Emyu's coach.  We Love Stay OLe
M. Salah is going crazy this seoson🤯🔥🔥

Mo Salah receiving the same pass he gave Sadio for his goal against Watford. What you give around, come backs around.
That last assist from Henderson, damn
Liverpool club owners: renewing Salah’s contract is a public demand.
don't be sad and panic manchester united you had played very well.
I thought Mertesacker was really slow until i saw Maguire
United retired from big four😂😂
I think the Title of Banter club has been overused by United fans, but I guess it goes around in roundabouts, because those “banter clubs” are laughing at you! 😂
Alhamdulillah🤲

Congrats Liverpool and the whole team for their great win.
Lol tsimikas
3 rd goal was insane
Déjà vu for ronaldo,  he thought he playing the El Clásico with the left footed maestro getting the hattrick and MOTM award.
From a United fan..We were humbled and thrashed with no mercy. United players cannot run, no vision and absolutely clueless on the pitch.. I would blame Ole, wat on earth is he coaching my goodness.  I rate Klopp wat a manager, he is the difference and Salah he is the best in the world no doubt. :(
I'm from. Egypt.. Salah proud to all Arabs 🤍🇪🇬
golden left leg mo salah
Things I love To see 💔💔
Bravo LIVERPOOL👏👍 U Never Walk Alone Amazing
Liverpool selalu salah 😂
1:19 Keita celebrates before the ball even gets in the net, that just show how confident they are with Salah every time he's in the box.
This is the most satisfied result for me
OLD TRAFFORD IS OUR NEW TRAINING GROUND..We used Man United to prepare for our next game..
Poor cr7....
Hopes and pray for Naby Lad, He's on Fire🔥 and now have to deal with new injury, hopefully he'll recover soon
The worst United inside old Trafford Olegunar take the responsibility for the next day in Manchester... Or leave the club and all the defenders...
Brilliant performance by Liverpool YNWA 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙👏👏👏👏👏
Every goal came from Shaw and Maguires side. They are absolutely shocking players. Once again its overrated English players. They would be better off with a new centre back and then signing KT from arsenal. Shocking  And pogba! The most overrated player in football history. Horrendous

Ole dibuat bingung dengan taktik liverpooll
If mo salah didn't win world best I won't watch football again
So Ronaldo didn't get a red card for kicking jones..., ooh no no it's Ronaldo, the marketing merchant nobody talks badly about him.., my bad
Salah is really incredible best in the world 👑👑
MANTAP
Lagsung trending
Roberto Firmino what a player He is striker or attacking midhfielder? beautifull skil and pases from firmino What a man?
Nu e vina lui Ronaldo daca defensiva a fost varza
Where is Ronaldo's offside goal?🤣
Bobby Firmino 9 almost involved every goal. He is back to his best as false 9, he is the best in his position which is Klopp's system (The LFC System). Even there was no goal and direct assist, but Bobby was the first to defend and dictated almost Liverpool team attack play. To: Bobby Firmino (Please don't bother other people questioning your goal scoring, just keep doing what you are doing now as Kloppo Gegen System. You are the best false 9 in the world). Bobby Firmino is truly Liverpool FC legend.
Ole out WENGER IN
Maguire is out of sorts.   He already has a defeated looks before game started.   And that goes the same for Leicester and Atlanta game too.
Lucky
Wow
I am waiting for the every angle of goals
Mo Salah on fire
Can't wait to see "inside old trafford" HAHAHAHA
BADUT YA GAES YAA
Man Utd ...f***ing disgrace !!!! Matt Busby would turn in his grave, wot a bloody shower...
nothing special just a training hahahah
we need a extra highlights for this match!
SO GOOD OF THE EDITOR THAT HE DIDNT INCLUDED RONALDO'S DISRESPECTFUL KICK IN THE HIGHLIGHTS. CR7 thats was so disgraceful to see as a football fan
Ole Sucks
What happened to De Gea? I know it's not his fault for this match, but why did he start to play so bad?
ole as at the wheel, ole must be to stay
Hope the FA investigates and ban the Portuguese diver for 8 matches.
Ole…..ole……you did great !
Love the way tsimikas just took the ball off Salah, he truly is a Robbo understudy 😂😂
OLE'SSS AT THE WHEELLL

I savoured every minute of this stunning display.   For the duration of this football match, my beloved Liverpool FC were simply on another level.   Man United dismantled, Mo Salah continuing to rewrite history and a team display that dreams are made of. We move on and we keep battling. YNWA.
Lets talk about Mr.Tap in performance......hahahah

Alison would be the worst player for LFC because he just stood at his goalpost for nothing and did not move forward and attempt to score a goal.
Mo salah ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Kostas at the end hehehehe
Always SALAH ❤ Always Liverpool💓
UTD we're lucky Liverpool eased up at 5-0. That could have got really embarrassing. I think Liverpool just played it around to avoid more injuries. That was a total demolition of a hugely expensive UTD team.
No one's talking about how so beautifull passing Hendo
Excellent M Sala God bless you From Bangalore India
When you can't achieve clean sheets against others, you had this coming against Liverpool and you knew it. Nothing to be surprised about...
im watch 2 time.. liverpool 10 -  0 mu

Next ballon d'or winner is mo Salah
Yah terbuly wkwk
Y N W A
Naby you the best....wish you speedy recovery
It's really unfortunate for Manchester Ltd
Konate gave away ball 2 times but later he played well, he took his time to settle in a Big Game. Van Dijk was perfect as usual, even he went shoulder to shoulder with Crisitano, Robertson's deflection was important otherwise Cavani would've scored 1, Trent made good passes with 1 assist, Naby was on Fire, he scored 1 goal made fast passes + dribbles - he got injured 3 times, I hope he will recover fast, Henderson made 1 assist + good passing in the back & midfield, Milner also played well but got injured - Hope he will also recover fast. Jones also played well, specially that moment when he defended against Crisitano, Jota took the chances he got as usual, Then what can I say about Mo Salah, he was perfect & Hungry for more, Alisson also played well specially that Greenwood save. Firmino made good passes and tried to create chances Y N W A
Well done Liverpool.  United  have to be defeated till they uncover the problem
HOAX
😭😭😭
I'm from indonesia : wkwkwkwk

My best day so far in 2021 !!!!!
maguire is a joker, look at his position as defender, sack him
Pertahanan kacau Kerja samanya sangat buruk Pada egois semua minim Tak Tik dan strategi udh terpancing emosi semua Dan juga fokusnya sudah hilang Jadi wajar di bantai 5-0
Schalke 04   Man U 05.

It was a slaughter! Liverpool ran roughshod over Manchester and they had no answer.
That Defense was high AF!
Well played

Amazing..
I know I've been Liverpool fan for 30 years now, but what Ronaldo did today is just horrible. He lost my respect now
Just looking forward to see Salah renewing contract with Liverpool. He's the man we need, no matter the cost. Also feeling anger towards Pogba, who gave injury to man who really put big progress this game.
Very amazing.. MOHAMMED SALAH
Salah omg wt a beast player but getting paid so less
MoSalah the best so far
Ruthless Liverpool
Liverpool ape kawan-kawan? Liverpool power💪. Love from Malaysia🔴

Naby Keita played very well. For me ha is very underrated
Monster from egypt.. love him
Just when we were seeing the best of keita, he gets injured by a clumsy challenge from pogba, hope he recovers soon, now elliot and keita out for some months, dont want squad becoming thin in this crucial season were liv are challenging again across all fronts
Ronaldo Football Club dibantai di kandang sendiri NGOAHAHAHAHAHA

There was no way to handle these players for the Man Utd defence or midfield, the quality difference was infact massive, good luck with that squad Ole.

I see Harry was wearing his invisible cloak again..
Liverpool were trying to get out of Manchester safely in the second half, else the scoreline could have been 8-0
Pogba tackle was not even a red card…
patahin aja kakinya si salah
First trending in my country, Indonesia. Elclsico in 2nd trending
Did anyone notice its the usual Pogba Loosing the ball that led to the 5th goal. Don't create excuse for an average player, IF loosing the ball a recurrent theme of his game for 5 years...Is that not enough Assurance that he is just not good on the ball. A world class player might ne out of form, but that never affect assurance on the ball,its just a basic skill pogba lacks. Nothing in this world affects players ability to keep the ball at his feet, There is not excuse for that.
Thanks for accelerating Man U’s manager search, Liverpool!
Salah gives the hattrick ball, what a humble person
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Forza Salah Forza Roma
YNWA ❤️❤️❤️

Ada apa dengan MU ??
SALAH IS GOAT
Seriously! My team is Liverpool but this match being between two giants was somehow not fair! How could Manchester not perform? Even the lowest ranking team gave Liverpool their worth! Really the ball is round!
Meskipun salah tapi gapapa lah
The reds 👍👍👍
May God bless you to score even more goals. Thank you Salah for your feat against M United .
Ole Stay!!!
Moh. Salah harus nya dapat Ballon D'or setiap tahun

If Pogba could stop changing his meaningless hairdo, and pay more attention to the match rather than his living styles, I would say he may probably have a chance to win a premier league champion before his retirement someday. LOL.

woallaa...5goals, for liverpool....
Send Taki instead of Mane for a run out. Just a thought.
Liverpool the best 👍👍
We still had a few gears left in the tank
Hahaha MUnyuk nangis liat nya 🤣🤣
Mohammed Salahhhhhhhh. There's no stopping the Egyptian Pharaoh
I think Salah at his best form of his life. 🔥🔥🔥
Massacred
Personnellement je n'accable pas le coach, les joueurs , on dirait tous amorphes pas étonnant qu ils ont reçu cette raclée
We are all love olee olee
All the MU fans silence in the stadium and twitter are proudly presented by Mo Salah.
Any other Manchester united fans?!?! 😪
Today I feel Manchester united got what te deserve lack of sportsmanship by men in red
Ronaldo who?
Seperti mimpi 😭😂sedih dan bhagia ketika Liverpool bisa membantay mu di  kandang nya   good job the red   NYWA from Indonesia fans
Can't believe Harry Maguire is the most expensive central defender in History, is just fucken unbelievable
Cr7 ketar ketir wkwokwkw
MO salah 👌
Harry Maguire is pathetic lmaoooo. Absolutely pathetic. 3rd division quality centre back. He should be selling jerseys at the local store or maybe hot dogs infront of the stadium, not start at the centre back position.
You will never walk alone ❤
😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍
Great match boys
MENANG KU SANJUNG, KALAH KU PULANG🤣🤣🤣
The defender, traitor to MU, got involved in an unpromising tackle in the middle of the half of football field of Liverpool. As a result, the first goal was scored. Further, in the same spirit. Portugal's best playmaker has been replaced by second traitor MU. As a result, MU was left without a pre-maker. It looks like the bookmaker Abramovich ordered the score 0:5.
CLUB TINGGAL KENANGAN, YANG SELALU MENGUNGKIT MASA LAU HHAHAHAHA, FANS GHOIB, BARU AJA BABAK KEDUA, DAH BALIK🤣🤣
Man Utd just renewed their yearly subscribtion for embarrassing results service
thank you mo wrong you have made me happy  Liverpool you are a great team
Hhhh ways ronaldo

Liverpool came at Old Trafford and burnt it down literally🔥😂😂.. Where is Ole at? Someone fire that "innocent face" guy😂😂😂
MO SALAH NIH BOS S3NGGOL!! DONG! 👊👊👊
MU is done, they should sack Ole.
I am Man Utd fan but a football fan first. Liverpool deserved to thrash to unmask this Ole guy as a manager.
Nice try RRQ
Hope keita is ok , disgusting challenge
Ole outttt Cr 7 outttt
He has got to be the best player of altimeter now
2022 ballon d'or is for Salah
Salah involved in all 5 goals. 3 goals 2 assists. Best in the world. From a cr7 fan.

Katanya bek chelsea yg paling buruk, kenyataannya.........

I cant beleive it
Niceee❤
Son: Yes daddy! Ronaldo is finally here to help us win the Premier league and champions league. Dad: Son, he is not here to help us. He is here for the money. Thats the reason Juventus let him go. I mean which club can afford to pay $1million pound per week to a 37year old player who only loves money. Being greedy get you to nowhere..
RonLdo mandul 😝😝😝😝
LOLOLOLOL penaldo 7 playing red light green light HAHAHAHA
Love liverpool
No Salah, No Liverpool...
As a man utd fan, Salah is one of the best player out there and great teamwork from Liverpool which man utd have none during this match.
No Matip, no Fab, no Mane, no problem...
Salah is the best player around today, no question about it
Saya salah satu orang yang  menyukai tim liverpor era jurgen klop,,tapi sya fans mu sejak lama.. Hasil ini bikin saya senang😄bercampur sedih😭 Disisi lain saya tidak suka terhadap olle😏😖😡
From the beginning, look at Robertson's run. The lad never stopped running...
Munyuk kalah lagi tim lawak pelatih pelawak 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fatality
It was a clear red for ronaldo.
I'm the only man utd fan who can't deny Liverpool is bigger than. Us
Wahhahahh, Trending 1 Indonesia
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡
Mohamed Salah the King 👑
I’m a Liverpool fan but I was not expecting 5-0
Jgn sok bahasa Inggris Cok,, pake bahasa Indonesia
Devil always a looser, they need to change their evil logo for their better future...

Thanks mo salah ❤️
We are going to win the league
YOU'LL NEVER WALKE ALONE 😍🔥👏🏻
Si senorrr
GO TO CAVE
Mu nya ngantuk
Lord ronaldo😂😂😂😂😂
Ingat! Laki-laki selalu salah.
bubukkk
The so-called goat🐐  came to England,  Liverpool used him for Salah. 😊
I know everybody is talking about Salah's performance, awesome, no doubt, but i think there's one factor for this team good moment... Virgil comeback, since he is return a good level, Liverpool is a machine again.
Pogba : why
Kehadiran  cr7 menambahkn  luka  pada  mu dan  juga  teruk  dibelasah  Liverpool  sebagai  pengajaran ....bukn  cr7  yg  mbawa  tuah  tapi  lebih  mbawa  sial  bagi  mu
Salah run passed thru mu defenders for his 1st goal shows it all.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🍻
محمد صلاح ابن بلدي ربنا يوفقك دوما 🇪🇬♥
Best best best 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Klopp: Do you think you can get a hattrick against these Muppets. Salah: Hold my Baklava's. 😋🤣

It's like playing FIFA on Easy 😆
YES!
King salah
😃😃☝️
🙌🏼😂
why Liverpool why? why didn't you killed us with 8-0 or 9-0, you allowed ole some more time. I will urge city and tottenham to go for kill than we can have proper manager or may can challenge in next 2-3 years time🙏
Mu mah gak ada apa2nya ..yg di banggain cuma sejarah jaman sir alex.hehe
Man... Naby lad had great performance lately but now he get injured again this time by Killmonger.
Yes, of course. Don't show the garbage sportsman that is Ronaldo just because he's a superstar.
Fact that they had Ronaldo in the team makes this so satisfying. Things that you wanted to happen as a Liverpool fan happened Mo hattrick , Ronaldo losing his head and have a goal ruled offside and pogba red card
My God,Henderson’s pass was sick!
Very good game 😍
🤣🤣🤣
FANS MU, MAKAN LAH SIKIT
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy a week of silence, proudly brought to you by Liverpool.
Monterrey 1-2 Liverpool 🤑🤑
if MANCHESTER UNITED maintains ole until the end of the season maybe MANCHESTER UNITED is thrown into the second tier
Tiga dari lima gol Liverpool ini Salah deh keknya
last i remembered man u lost 5-0 was against Newcastle at St. James Park
M.Salah 👏👏👏
Just  the Quality of REDS🔴🔴....this is called class.

Happy for the team, sad for Keita 😢

Man UTD fans be like Before game: Bark Bark Bark After game: meow meow meow
I commented on a shorts before the match saying Salah is best in the league right now and I was replied by Ronaldo fan boys saying "no ronaldo is better".  I was wrong, Salah is best in the world at the moment and Ronaldo fan bois have their answer.
Guys,  MU is History
Beban ole...
Thanks RED, YNWA
Livrpool 💪💪🚩

Siiiiiiiiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Mo Salah is the best at the moment, no doubt
akwowkwowkk
Liverpool's best team
Henderson n milner👍
How hard it is to train Salah... Klopp: easy..he doesnt drink, doesn't do clubbing, no womanising , never stay out late..no trash talk...no glamorous celebrities lifestyles....he just train and play football.
Mang ipul idolaku

Where is CR7?? 🤣🤣...
MUNYUK BERUK :(

All ManU remain is only its powerful history.
United has the right players but............ Not the right to mind.
Mo Salah is an amazing player . I enjoy seeing him handling the ball . An artist.  Todays match is a landmark for a nonstopable Liverpool this season.
Looks so easy

Did CR7 play this match?

Di obok-obok MUnya di obok-obok, ada ikannya kecil-kecil pada mabok. Dingin-dingin, dimandiin, MU masuk angin.
All the Arsenal fans would like to thank and congratulate Liverpool. We are praying so that you can win the league ❤  Also pray for us to get European football 😭😭😭

Mo salah is crazy
Liverpool is best club in the world.
Man united is my favorite  club, but in this match why they play like tortoise? I think hard work is more less in this match, anyway dnt give up my fav club
Feeling sorry for Ronaldo

Salah of Argentina is Messi.
Liverpol ini geng Senggol donk 😂😂😂
No mames el 23 es un tronco y el central es una desgracia jajaja asco

I can watch this all day that's how happy I am god u hate Manchester United
THE KING MUHAMMAD SALAH ⚽👑
Captain salah on fantasy premier league . ....Thanks for 40 points  Chelsea fan
YNWA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Team bintang 🌟 idiot MU
Liverpool is tough team to beat 👍🙌
Except for Hendo 's assist for the 5th, the other 4 goals were very ordinary. No moment of genius was needed, just hard work.  ManU are there for the taking, for any organised, hardworking Premiership side.
Bantai
Thank you 🙏 from a Manchester United fan. We need more loses like this then only our renowned ex player cum pundits, so called intellect fans, and don’t care management will understand the real problem. A proper management will start hunting for a new coach and imho united at least scout and find the next pep and klopp or else they must hire the service of Eric ten Hag the current ajax coach.
Oh happy day (Oh happy day) When Salah scores (When Salah scores) He washed the Mancs away (Oh happy day)
I remember 5 years ago: Me: Liverpool, common! Man U fans: Looserpool? What a looserpool? Is this a team? I just want to say that i really enjoyed this game! Man United had already deserved this!!!
What a game! Salah for ballon d’or!! And i just hope Mane gets his rhythm! We def need him too!
YNWA from Indonesian,,, LIVERPOOL forever 👍
SALAH IS A BEAST .. THE FUTURE GOAT
I'm a fan of Liverpool in South Korea. I don't regret watching the game instead of sleeping at night. And Salah is really crazy this season.
Ole stay
Ronaldo tak berkutik wkwk
If Ole is sacked after this, United should thank Liverpool, they're actually helping United...
Liverpool play a team.. Mu?
Ronaldo who?
this is why i slept very well last night
King Mo👑 thrushing Man Useless
Liverpool ❤️❤️
Save ole pls 🙏
YNWA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
even brighton more better
Great Job Kloop!
Este liverpool está en otro nivel. Me encantaría verlo medirse ante el Bayern München.
Tbh This Liverpool Side Played Football Like City Played in the first half against them. Whenever a clearance happened , Liverpool player war there & United's defence was just too too Bad. None of those players even tried to Press them or mark them well. Look at all the goals , almost no trickery from Liverpool players yet the attackers always had ample of space to attack & penetrate. I really like Curtis Jones tbh , he's fast athletic & can pass pretty well , an awesome link in the Mid & sometimes flank. if United wants to have a better Mid then Fred , there's a local boy in our team & he's definitely better than him. Liverpool thrashed United not only on the pitch but Mentally too if only they had it. What Cristiano did should have been a Red too , it was intentional the first time & luckily for him , there was a ball next time. Shouldn't be happening from such a player at this level at all.
ole out.
LIVARPOOL IS 💩
*ميسي أفضل منه*
That pass from Henderson ⚡⚡⚡⚡👏
Ole stay , 11 players out Ole play alone 🤣
feel sad for ronaldo, already a legend, but decide to join mediocre team. and who is that guy decide to choose that maguire magiur magurei whatever as the team captain definitely has 1 brain cell.
Man U fan🤣💔💔💔
How does Man U have so much money, and still can’t buy themselves a good team? These defenders defend like me😂😵
What a loser Progba
A dark day in our history, but Mo what a beast! And what a pass from Henderson!
Man u get out from EPL go to championship..haha??
Where is Ronaldo
The real futsal 😂
You deserve it
Great game.but i feel lfc need to unload keita if its a long term injury..and bring some some quality signing of a midfielder in January.kroos will be available i guess.we need a back up midfield..jones defending is unreliable
Ronaldo out😆
liverpool 5-0 watford,and 5-0 man u  😂
Crybaby Ronaldo 😅
Be Patient, Arsenal Know you feel MU 😂
Pemain mu mirip sepakbola kampungku dulu..bek nya ngejar bola keroyokan..menyedihkan
Ole out...
And yeah okay salah is the best of his team but the other team players are better than every other team its a strong 10 with a knuckle 💪🏻

Score could have been 8-0 or maybe more if liverpool played their game with same attacking attitude but after kieta got injured they got cautiously calmed down their game not to get injured. I'm lucky liverpool fan not to miss this match. ❤️
SALAH always gives his best on the field. thank you for your hard work
Yes this gives a smile in my face

Ganti pelatih Dan jangan pernah dipakai lagi Pogba sama Bruno Fernandes pasti ok MU
Salah si gesit irit
But still ballon d'or top contenders are messi and lewa. They just don't consider 2 weeks performance. So don't Shout mo salah for ballon d'or
please stay Solskjaer
8-2 pessi fans.. Hold that.. Also pessi lost 4-0 bottling a huge 3-0 lead in the ucl seminfinals.. Never compare pessi and ronaldo.. Ronaldo lost in a random league game and still scored a good goal which got disallowed sadly
ole sucks!
Liverpool Fans beleives in Salah supremacy 🔥
There is no Benzema to dash Ronaldo the ball 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. It is over.
Amazing ❤️
I just love how this United team makes Ronaldo look like an average player 😂
Discussion about who is the best player among Messi, Ronaldo, and Salah can be decided between Messi and Salah now.  😊😎
Egyptian king 🇪🇬🇪🇬
That's what is called surgical strike.
Wohooo ❤️❤️❤️

That henderson pass & work rate versus Pogba & his red card. Sums up the match. Scholes was right it is a buffet for liverpool.
Gimme that hattrick ball!!
Liverpool semakin terbiasa menang di Old Trafford.
All hail Mohammed Salah, our King of Egypt and also Bobby Firminho who in my opinion is our unsung hero last night, his movement makes Maguire looks like an idiot that he is

Terrible Man Utd performance, no fight at all. Pls keep Ole for years.
lüv it how slah always chases the ball mo matter what the score is, what a guy brilliant player
💥
i have never seen such a useless defender like Maguire.
Hurrahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 💙💙
صلاح 🇪🇬👑
Salah salah salah
where position of maguire and lindelof? are they striker?
Setan abang di gulung gaesss, wkwkwk
Greatest Liverpool Line up Of All Time!
Liverpool really have a mercy on man united last night just like what germany did to brazil years ago
ronaldo goal is more beautiful than all goal in my eyes but not acceptᥬ🤯᭄
つっよ
EMYU AMPAS 🤣🤣🤣YNWA 😘😘🔥🔥💪💪💪
❤❤❤
MU rr alias remuk redam
Great work 😂😂
Hallah Baru gitu aja senang anj,
Salah was great But United will be kicking themselves cz they know , they've just executed some terribly bad defending
Mo saleh best one fifa
By all cost, we have to keep Salah
Liverpool ilove
defend Mu lemah
Actually is Maguire an attacker or a midfielder? If the captain doesn't know where to play, God bless the team. I had respect for Man U. But this guy is not even worth the jersey, forget the armband. Maybe political pressure.
not even sure why pogba is dtilll wasting his talent at man utd SMH
😂😂😂 I'm glad to see Jota play a part in smashing up Man Utd on their own patch! 😍😍😍
SALAH THE NEXT BALOON DOOR
What a night
mohamed is one of the best players at the moment.. every time he scores a goal he has good skills.. he is the greatest player
Asanteni Liverpool kwa kuwafunga hawa  nyumbu
Come on guys..... Ole must stay.... Why did you guys score 5 goals?????
Klopp : If salah does'nt win the balon d'or the french football is coruppt
What the hack 😂😂😂😂
Terbantai
Ronaldo best player in the world ? My foot, he deserved red card instead of yellow for kicking Jones. In my opinion he is more like a street goon on the football field, kicking, pushing & abusing opponents at his best.
Joker United is a history club
HM proven that he is a clown. Good job.
It's ok to appreciate Liverpool attack but the actual reason for such an offensive performance was due to weak Manchester defence.
pertahanannya MU 😭
watched this hightlights over and over again never gets tired by their outstanding performance
What a win at Old Trafford.. Ronaldo shd hv been red carded for his act. Some how,  I think arrival of Ronaldo made MU lost their usual playing style.. Hope the reds will keep this momentum till end of the season.. YNWA..
Like it or not, salah is the best player in the world rn, if we look at the current form
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Salah🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Auto Subscribe Liverpool
Ok the Salah hat-trick was a big deal but THAT HENDERSON PASS
i know liverpool gonna win this match
Pateeeen BosQ🔥🔥

The MU defence is messy.
Big mistake AS Roma kick Moh salah..now he became a hero in liverpool.. wkwkwmwkwk
The Egyptian King. I am Egyptian and I am proud of 💪

मुला सलह किरा,,,राेनाल्डाे हाम्रो हिरा😍
BOOM
C Ronaldo too  why is he is  kicking the  boy like that .. maybe he think he is playing   kickboxing lol 😂... he should have gotten red card too .. don’t know y Pogba  got red card for that tacking n he got yellow card for that hash kicking
THIS DESERVES FULL HIGHLIGHTS MR ADMIN
I love mo salah from bangladesh
Man utd Defense= TRASH!
And Paul Scholes say that MU Defenders is better than Chelsea,what a joke 😀
Lewandowski like finishing with Messi like movement and touch. Pay Salah what he deserves and lock him down 🦅🦅
I wanna Salah to be Egyptian president soon.
Rip liverpool
Congrats liverpool you win first time 😁😁because porgba get red card

🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank' Liverpool,,,,,,good job team & Mohammad salah
Kena ayam2 ja mu hahahah
Salah tetap tak bersalah🔥
Thanks, Ole! Please stay!!!! Hahahahaha
If United played 11 the whole match, Liverpool will score at least 7. Red card forced them to parked Bus and Liverpool players knew its not worth the sweat.
살라 미쳣네..
Beatles & Mo. Salah are the great "singers" of all time, Thanks Liverpool.  😄😆😉
SalahSalah🔥Salah🔥Salah🔥Salah🔥
Ronaldo shots on target 1  Ronaldo shots on jones 3
Week before this very game, I've said that if Mo Salah scores a hattrick, he'll proudly deserve a new unlimited length contract. Now, at Anfield I'm expecting actions!!!
Poor poor United, even pogba intentionally got himself sent off with a cheeky smile.. everything is in a mess now
ez game
Trendingkan
Stunning Mo...the kop lagi latihan aja ini mah 🤣
this video is disliked by 1.8k United fans, lol
My level will go high 🤣🤣🤣
meguire play like a child who don’t kno whats he Play 🤣
What a player! Mohammed Salah you are something else…
Maguire sama pogba ngantuk ,,
YNWA 🔥
As a United fan, I think Liverpool played absolutely amazing football and deserved to win. Also while watching this video, all I see is Maguire incompetence. Having Luke Shaw and Lindelof also doesn't help.
THAT ASSIST FROM HENDO
Bisa" nya kgk masuk tranding asu
Minum Coca cola makanya

manchester is blue repsect liverpool amazing club
Meanwhile there is still no video highlights on Man utd channel🤣🤣🤣
Man that Pogba foul was mean, I will never understand why ManUtd players always plays like that when they loose. Bro if you are trash don't injure other players, Naby was playing very well and now Liverpool have another midfielder down. Hope he will get well soon.
The siiiiiiiiuuuuu not existi
Terimakasih mola TV udah kasih tayangan gratis buat w nonton liverpool
LB for manu is fucked up
what atea effort. mo and keita on fire and peaking right now. but the through passes by jordan n jota are just amazing
Mo Salah...The Beast from the middleast
Scoring made easy-new tactical book written by Salah ,kudos salah ,well done lfc/fans.We are liverpool ,this means more .
Mo Salah!!!!!! Ballon d'Or :D
Poor overrated defender leads to 5 Nil
It could have been 10-0 if we wouldn't have parked the bus for the last 30 min
Salah should have remove his Jersey after his hatric goal... That too at old trafford😒😐
Fick 5 🤣🤣🤣
Things we learned: 1. As in 2015, Gerald came in the game against UTD and got red card, Pogba also got red card after dews minutes of games. This is the karma 2. The former goat, the king of hatrick CR7 handed his crown 👑 to the new goat Mo Salah who score a hatrick 3. Man Utd fans were supporting Liverpool after leading of 3-0, then they were hoping Ole to be sacked.😂

Two of my beloved teams won : RMA and LIV 👌🙏 sad Pogba, i hope next season he will play in a better club 🙏🙏🙏
Love u Liverpool
WE ARE LIVERPOOL 💕
And where was the legend Christiano Ronaldo 😳🥺🥺. Thanks Liverpool my team

SALAH WE LOVE YOU MAN, KEEP WORKING HARD BRO, YOU ARE THE BEST AND I WISH YOU GET THE BEST WORLD PLAYER, LIVERPOOL IS THE WORLD BEST TEAM
Impressive performance by Liverpool and all the dislike are united and Ronaldo fans. Love from Manchester city
Ole just needs to do some 'management' thing
Solskjaer is sacked for sure
Wow
Back MU kalah lari
y el bicho donde esta?
Thank's Salah.. hatur nuhun Liverpool 😀👌
Easy work for LIVERPOOL!!
I'm an all round sports guy. Football isn't my top sport but if I recall correctly from experience, 3-0 is a bad loss but 5-0 is a beat down.
Mo Salah!!! Africa to the world🔥
We need to pay Mo whatever he is asking for.  If he wants £500,000 a week give it to him.  That comes out to £130,000,000 for five years.  He stays in shape and has no bad habits in his personal life.  Doesn't drink or smoke.  A family man that only wants to be the best at his job.  In the immortal words of Teddy KGB "pay him; pay that man his money."
mu memalukan
WHAT HUMILITY OF THE MANCHESTER LENDING HIS STADIUM FOR THE LIVERPOOL TO TRAIN
Ole out
Well done guys 🙏
Dear commentator. His parents named him "Muhammed" salah. Not "Mo"salah or Oolaaalaah.  Yes. I mean it
Man of the match Ole 👏👏👏
Omg salah🔥🔥

A perfect 3 goals by Mo Salah enough to shut the mouth of Man Utd

Salah el mejor del mundo 🌎
Gw kira suhu  Ternyata cupu  🗿
Awesome
MU Dont have deffender..stpd
THE FIRST MISTAKE THE UNITED COACH DID WAS TO GIVE MAGUIRE THE CAPTAINS BAND, HE DID NOT DESERVE IT BIT. THE HYPOCRISY IN FOOTBALL IS KILLING UNITED BECAUSE HE IS ENGLISH BY PASSING DE GEA WHO HAS BEEN HUMBLE SERVANT TO UNITED FOR THE PAST TEM YEARS, SHAME TO OLE.
MU lg lawak 😂
Nobody marks Salah at all. He move freely like doing at his backyard.
best game but the mu too dirty play hurt the players, Ronaldo also nothing have the sportmanship
why Mo
Liver pool last 8 games they score 33 goals that means my club Liver pool last 8 games in one game in average 4.12 goals they score.wowwww
why not Mohamed Salah
Prayers for Naby Lad
Mo salah no doubt 😂
ronaldo was over as long with united
I want receive huge thx to glazers and ole

That Are Really Our Red
SALAH IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD❤
Thats why i dont like Ronaldo.....he starts crying...when they're about to lose
محمد صلاح فخر العرب 🔥🔥🔥
I love Liverpool Football Club. I love Jurgen Norbert Klopp. I love Mohamed Salah!
over all you can say that salah better than ronaldo
The best player in league
*Manchester United everytime, after losing: it's the fault of Ole, our players are toys, Ole told them not to run while playing. No credits of opponents and opponents who scored the goals. Bla bla bla* 🤡🤡🤡
🙏Hopefully this season LFC can win 🥇🏆EFL Cup, 🥇🏆FA Cup, 🥇🏆Premier League, & 🥇🏆Champions League.  👏💪Come on Liverpool✊👍.  🔥You'll Never Walk Alone🔥
As a Man City fan I should be happy with the result but I was actually feeling bad for the Red Devils. Liverpool should’ve allowed them a consolation goal.
Take all my money and give King Mo Salah a lifetime contract.... YNWA
Moooo Salah
Liverpool stopped attacking after the fifth goal, this shows how sporting and top class they are Enjoy guys Ynwa
23번  누구냐...
Man city be like : omg 😂
Salah reminds me a lot of Luis Suárez.
Man U fans😭.. What will we tell people??  Really disappointed 😞
MashAllah currently the best in the world, Mohammad Salah!!! Respect from a Bayern Munich fan!
It makes Man U so small and nobody.
What a day..!!! 😍😍😍
👑💪🏻❤️
NICEEEE :)
World-class gameplay. CR being pocketed by Konate.
Enga tega di bantai 0,5 memalukan MU harus bangkit
No penalty no party 🥳🎉🥳🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
historical game
Mampus totol 5
I like Liverpool
SUIIIIIII
Salah is the greatest winger the prem has ever had
United is Back 💪💪💪
Felt like Liverpool lads were playing a game of Fifa 21 in Easy difficulty. What a horrible display of defense.
Next level performance by Liverpool 💪
Its funny how they included the red card to Pogba 😂😂😂😂
That first goal how Salah control the momentum and see Keita movement, that is GOLD....... checkmate...... no more Menchester United domination after Furguson until year 2100, that is my point. That is Menchester United curse.
The got moh ❤💪💪
Manchester United is actually Watford who can afford to pay Ronaldo honestly. Really miss the times when rivalry between both team is so fiery. I miss the old ManUnited under Sir Alex. I miss the underrated talents and signing from him.
That's a lot of damage
Where Is Penaldo ?
INJECT THIS INTO MY VEINS!!
Mu nih boss senggol dong wkwkw
Fun fact: Old Trafford is Liverpool's training ground
Congrat Salah 👍👍👍
Only man u higlight is the red card😂 thats tuff
Salah <3
This could have gone 7 or even 8 goals if they were really intending to do it. History would have been created, the worst loss for manu at home at the hands of liverpool.
The highlight is more of a liverpool as a team  vs man utd defense 😂
O maior da Inglaterra venceu ❤
Modol sia MU hahahaha
Salah🔥💯
Man United need time to recover but what's to worry is considering their current form this season would go wasted in trial and errors. High time ole leaves the club voluntarily
They defence and tatics of man united is worst. They cannot even mark a muhammad salah. Manchester defencer are they laziest.
no matter they will win against hotspur but they should have beaten liverpool
Probably the shortest highlights on the Liverpool channel. Love, from India.
Amazing Game... Liverpool Overpower , Mo salah On fire
salah
Mun Lost so bad 😫
gol kelima salah itu mirip gol kelima pas tragedi 1-6 😂
arsenal ampuun ampuuun ampuuun give up give upp 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

MU  nih bos senggol dong
Que hermoso es el liverpool!!
We lost 2 midfielders today Including Harvey, that's 3.  Let's hope we don't see the repeat of last season's luck with injuries...
Mo got was defintly man of the match , but can we talk about bobby´s game? He was superb. I´m so happy he is back on form
hmnn
King Mo..!!
Keeeeeeeep Salah otherwise you will suffer to have another talent..
Top scorer Mo salah, gills 💥
Liverpool was too kind after that red card, they could score 5 more goals
Mo Salah 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Fucking ManU's dirty play
Damn it feels so good to watch this over and over
1.6k dislikes from Manchester united fans? Thats your sportsman spirit ?
Liverpool we are above all teams, who were scoring 5 goals at old trafod.
Liverpool gave face to Man U after the 5th goal just by passing the ball around and not even trying hard to score.. if not, it would be 6-0 or even 7-0 and Man U will be humiliated even more.
I'am liverpool
Trending 1 nih bentar lagi ,salam dari binjai 🙏
Jugo?  El ronaldo?
*Một Thảm Hoạ bóng đá của Manu mang tên Ole,Hàng phòng thủ Man thì càng tệ,Đến nỗi Cr7 phải phát cáu,chán.Klop lại tiễn đồng nghiệp Ole đi 1 chuyến khá dài rồi*

Manchester United 0 - 5 Liverpool. Wow that is amazing.Mohammed Salah is the best player for now, he is the goal machine, of course with his teammate's support, but he is awesome. I hope liverpool can be EPL champion and UCL champion. I think liverpool must keep Mo. Salah stay in liverpool.

SALAH TERBAIK 😎😎😎😎
MU can win if there any SERGIO RAMOS, 🤭🤭🤭🤭😂

Ole allowed such a dimwit team like Liverfools to dominate them. Ole needs to be fired in order for Man U to continue their dominance over a dimvit team like liverfools
King Mo!!!

Good boys.Manchester United is just waste 😂😂😂

Respect to all player to say anythings
If United defense was a másk, you probably get Covid in the place where is practicly  imposible
Hahahahhahha Shaammblesss Uniitteeddd
Ronaldo terpongkang😂
4 x 0 on first half. "Gee, i better put Pogba on the game now to improve the team" Pogba loses ball to hendo and the 5h goal comes. then he gets the red card after 10 minutes in the game...damn
Langit bisakah kau turunkan hujan dengan petir? Fans emyu ingin menangis tanpa terlihat, ingin menjerit tanpa mendengar 😢
Salah pasti sholawat nya kenceng nih
Where the hell was Ronaldo?
Salah you rock it again
those who dun rate Keita - if you've seen him @ Leipzig know that he can improve even more under Klopp and thats very scary!

Sack Ole and bring a good manager  This united defense is worser than the Brazilian  defense in 2014 WC
Gak jelas permainannya kaya gembel berak
YNWA❤
When opponent gets red card we expect more goals. But Liverpool can't score, they can only keep possession. It was 3rd time in this season.
Mo salah destroyer 🔥
That's what good shirt can do
We had joy we had fun we had goals for everyone and the fun it did last old Trafford was a blast.
Old Trafford is training ground
*MO SALAH*...Fantastic

Everyone talking about salah goal. But that through pass for the fifth goal was just amazing .
Liverpool yu kryzi yo
manchester unishit
Egyptian King shows his magic
LoL🙆‍♀️
Thank you reds for incredible display. It was a great night and these are great times to be a Liverpool fan.
Incredible start salah
Perfect game for Liverpool.
hahahahaha
Salah > Crying penaldo
YNWA! Not a tactician but I was just wondering how and why was Keita given so much space with no Man U players around him for the first goal? Was too easy.
Pay salah what he wants and what he deserve
MO SALAH MO SALAH MO SALAH
Great game lads great to be a liverpool fan what a club man
aowkwokw...
OLE STAY FOREVER
Mohammed Salah the best
Masya Allah , Salah , YNWA 🔥🙏
I really think united downed tools because they know losing big against liverpool would likely get Ole sacked
Man Utd boys playing like Arsenal.. the PTSD is going to be heavy on this one
GACOOOR
🤩🤩🤩
Back to perform ynwa
Fck…what a demolition. Salah has arrived to the next level. Awesome.
Ole is the man
Liverpool players be like its just a training session 😂
emyu tolol awokwokwokwokwok

1.4K that disliked this video are Man Utd fans. What a beautiful game. YNWA
Мохаммед Салах достоин золотому мячу. Давайте поддержим нашего нападающего.
Sebagai penggemar City. Saya sangat memuji konsistensi Liverpool, kandidat kuat 3 besar selain City adalah Liverpool dan Chelsea. Sudah terlihat panas berkejar kejaran.  Tinggal menunggu kkub lain yg bergabung tersulut. MU sudah saatnya ganti pelatih.
Man U defense is trash
YESS 5-0, JUST GIVE SALAH THE BALLON D'OR ALREADY
Salah is 👍👍
Siuuuuuuu😂😂😂😂
Man United performance was horrible, They're broken before the game starts
الملك المصري محمد صلاح
Prem 21/22 on target letsgo YNWA

Salam dari Binjai 🔥
Ronaldo Clown 🤡
It is sad to see teams like Barsa and Manchester United in the situation they are today.
Keita's gol is so cooll.. 😍
I love Liverpool
Heheheheh munyuk

Sedih mu bawa batanang haaha
صلاااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااح  الافضل في العالم
Я очень рад за свою любимую команду, за то что он одержал победу. Ливерпуль поступил жентельменски по отношению МЮ после удаления Погбы и не хотели  забивать мяч сопернику который осталься в меншенстве. 🥇🥇🥇🥇👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿👌👌👌👌
🤣🤣🤣
Salah is burning 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i have 4 words              Manchester United is trash
You got served, man utd
Kayaknya ada yg "SALAH" sama Manchester united 😒
Ronaldo era is over as he is getting older day by day .
He is the best and fair to give him the balon dor but France is racist so they won't give it to muslim player
EASY GAME 👌
Hope Keita and Milner gets well soon! YNWA!
salah in indonesian its mean > wrong but, what he do, is correct🤣
He could win ballon d'or
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️🔥
Very entertaining... Naby and Mohammed fantastic
6 win 3 draw 0 losses what a start for Liverpool
MU Ampasss

😂😂😂0-5
Shala is boss
Salah benar
Salah FC like a Messi FC
The Mugs were Ripped Apart 😂
M slah layak dapat Ballon d Or 2021
Nabi Keita was playing mad yesterday. He was there behind all first 3 goals.  I felt he is about to be injured. Soon he got head injury. But he was not ready to leave the match. Then he got big injury. I hope he will get well soon!
Before the game most polls I saw had an overwhelming majority for united but I knew and anyone with logic would have known that Liverpool are going to win, I predicted a goal differential of 2, looks like I have been proven wrong
Liverpool is brilliant and on fire. But it's really pitiful to watch Man U last night.  They are in tatters and seem totally lost.
Respect to Liverpool who stop scoring after 0-5 🙏
Man United fan : 😑
MESSI BALON DIOR 2021.... REAL RONALDO IS FENEMENO RONALDO... R9
Keita was playing very good then he got injured i hope it is not serious injury
Don't worry keita the king you fellow African magic mate Mo salah got your back.
Save ole please..
When man u wins, its an 8min clip, when man u loses, its a 2min clip.
Mantab...👍👍👍👍👍 "the Reds Indonesia"
I hope Keita can come back quick ♥️

United played better with 10 men they didn't concede
M.salah masya ALLAH
Hahahaha....ROnaldo Kemanaaaa???? Memalukan sampai 5 - 0

as a man united fan this destroyed my soul
🥰👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
BADUT
Get ronaldo as player-manager
Mu mode slowmotion
The result was inevitable  .
Mohammad Salah is The Greatest of All the Time ❤️❤️❤️
Lord meguire afk
Terlalu tangguh M.U hingga nyamukpun ikut bahagia
Konate and Virg absolute destroy MU attackers. Keita back with the goals and he has improve his defending skills. Salah doing what he does best. Jota and Bobby top notch performance. TAA and Robbo back with the assist. Lets hope Keita injury is not that bad.
Sad for pugba
Mo Salah the true king on the pitch
Donde esta cr7 cr7 donde esta jajaja
MU playing just like no defender??🤣🤣🤣
Liverpoll memang mantap!!!!  Tdk perlu beli CR7 yg pnting mental juara👍👍
Loh kok gini
Mu is the big loser
My blood boiled like anything on the challenge Cristiano did on Curtis...it was indeed a red.  But at the moment what counts is the win , and this one is in the best possible way , lets keep going lads. Great job!! YNWA
GOAT Salah
Stay ole
The Great Liverpool😊👍✨😊👍✨
Salah > Ronaldo  This is Fact
Mazza
Everyone enjoyed this game except Man u fans
Salah ❤❤❤❤
Win a lot on Liverpool and also over 3full time. Thank you my Liverpool. YNWA.
Smashed them on their own turf…💪💪💪
Manu defenceless
High Five ManUnited👋😂
Salah involved in all 5 goals... Best in the world.
So, no yellow kit for the rest of the season yeah?
It means more.  Cahampion  and Premier league.....
Ruthless
Messi is goat 🐐 now Liverpool have played against both you can anytime ask players they will definitely say messi cause at that night messi was something else i know after then they lose but it was team fault messi was running one man show
Salah hanya manusia biasa yang bisa salah
Yee
Ok ok
Mu nooooooooooob
Mantap m. Salah .... semoga Allah selalu memberikan kesehatan
Liverpool FC vs BOT Manchester United
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
From now on, I am a big fan of Liverpool. Thank Liverpool. BTW, Ronaldo's attitude seems to have a lot of problem here.
masih segar 4 jam yang lalu
I wish Trent's blocked shot was shown too, that deserved a highlight too..
It's funny how Liverpool didn't even include Ronaldo's offside goal in this video
Liat pergerakan Maguire di proses gol ke 3 udh kaya bek kampung, itu yg buat MU ngeluarin duit sebnyak itu??
1 season sensation they said
Pogba did a Funos Mori on us. Smiles after a reckless challenge to take down Naby on purpose.
Thank you M. Salah
Henderson showed some Brazilian meets Rosicky
Mo salah will be the best player
It's clear now.
Get out CR7
This was the best comedy show in the league I've seen in ages, great performance from utd
Maguire fucking player. 🐕🐕
Where is CR.
Woooww..the true Reds 👏
Ha ha ha  Ynwa
mohamed solah.
Embarrassing for Manchester United
Is Mo Salah at his best ever????? 🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
Mo Salah....what a player 🔥🔥🔥. Also, Keita played very well too.
Mo salah is on fire 👌👌👌👌
Liverpool FC just "Nuked" Hiroshima, but this Hiroshima was Old trafford.
You know what, it's kind like PES one goal challenge... Literally you could score more than the title of the challenge because it facing clubs with one star ability... 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Cristiano loves revenge
Lest's goooo
Old Trafford 🤣😅😂
masyaAllah Muhammad salah..semoga Allah taala selalu menjaga mu
THX LIVERPOOL NOW OLE GET SACKS! YEAHH THX GOD
where is MU attempts ?🤣
What a wonderful day at Old Trafford  I'm still smiling.
YNWA 🔥
Salah is the ballondor winner this year.
Keep humble, not just win of the game, but win of the hearts🙏
Egypt King
I was hopping that Liverpool to  score 8 and 0 Man united. What they did to Arsenal in 2008.
SALAH 👍
Hatrick Gileee. 5;0
Olestay forever
Total goals scored by Ronaldo after comeback in premier league- 3   Goals of salah in one match  - 3
So-called GOAT was bussy eating grass while Salah scored a hattrick 😀
M.u no level😄
Mantap...
What a game 🔥🔴
❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏
Nabi, get well soon!
3 goals 1 assist.
Jugando así el liverpool hay que tenerlo en cuenta en la champions
Salah the best in the world

It's not a big match Lol ..
Tsimikas very happy 😁
Mohamed salah mantapppppp 👏👏👏👏👍
I from Indonesia YNWA.
Suiiiiiii😂
Just get this man a new contract please
So this is why people keep saying that salah is overrated every season? Overrated your head
As a Man Utd fan, I'm ashamed of that performance, I just want to bury my face in the pillow.
Ronaldo Who???
Midle player MU is nothing and look  over individual for Greenwood, freed .
The fact is this highlight didn't upload by MU official.
👏👏👏👏👏
Myrrr😓
I man wish there was no AFCON next year. Salah is going to miss at least 3 games. If he's in this form still, he's gonna be a huge miss and could maybe ruin a record breaking season.
Moooooo...SALAH 😎👍
SIIIIIIIUUUUUUU
Fantastic, Lads!
Indonesia mana nihhhhhhh
Liverpool 💪💪
Gilaa sii ini
Feels like fighting a lower division team, YNWA Feels like fighting a lower division team, YNWA.

As a Chelsea fan, I would like to congratulate Liverpool as we too destroyed an awful club this weekend 🤣
This is so satisfied to watch

MOHAMMED Salah
5 - 0 inside manchester united stadium, unbelieveable..liverpool amazing.
Never seen Liverpool in such a high class performance , what a day to remember for years . This is the greatest team work and great professional Training skills . I’m still enjoying the historical win that make me proud of the whole squad and Salah in particular . Love Liverpool forever 🥂
mentality and teamwork is the key
❤️❤️❤️
only a fool leaves cavani and pogba , solskjaer are you crazy ?
Why did Liverpool stop scoring in the 2nd half? I thought this games was gonna be something special. 😂
kaya futsal ya
Penando cry 😭
amajingggggggg🤪
You'll never walk alone
Salah is much better than Penaldo
Liverpool uploads all their wins and losses on their channel. ManU: Oh! There was a loss, but none exists on our channel.
Fraud Utd 🤣
HATS OFF!! YNWA!! 🔥🔥
Keita is a beast..the 1st 3 goals came from Keita
This is not the end guys! We have more games ahead, still long journey! Don't be  slower Reds! Treble winner this season.
Aduh aduh
What's going on with Mane. Why he so selfish. Jota in good position and mane shoot it.
Keren Liverpool,,bener kata bonucci hadir ny Ronaldo jadi ketergantungan...
Assist capt hendo 🔥🔥.
Pantas mengapa klopp sangat menyukai FIRMINO.. Good playmaker
Maguire na victor worst combination ..I think varane would not let goals to be conceded like that
Ole we need to change Ole we need a new coach why did he play Greenwood put Sancho  Who agree 👇
ชัยชนะอย่างสวยหรูของทีมหนึ่ง กับความพ่ายแพ้อย่างหมดรูปของอีกทีมหนึ่ง ดูแล้ว มันคนละอารมณ์ แต่ผมวิเคราะห์ว่า ศักยภาพของนักเตะแต่ละคน มีความสามารถพอๆกัน ไม่มีทีมใดทีมหนึ่งได้เปรียบเสียเปรียบกัน แต่ผลการแข่งขันนั้น ขึ้นอยู่กับรูปแบบการเล่นและวิธีการของผู้จัดการทีม  ถ้าจะบอกว่า โรนัลโด้เก่งกว่าซาลาห์ ก็ตอบไม่ได้ว่าใครเก่งกว่าใคร เพราะการเล่นฟุตบอล มันเล่นกันเป็นทีม เพราะฉนั้น อย่าไปด่วนสรุปว่า นักเตะแมนยูฯไม่เก่ง ผมชอบทั้งสองทีม เพราะเป็นทีมของขวัญใจของชาวไทยทั้งคู่ แต่ ผจก.ทีมนั้น โซลจาร์ ยังสู้กับระดับมันสมองอย่างคล็อปไม่ได้ ซึ่งผิดกับยุคท่าน Sir Alex Ferguson ที่วางแผนในการเล่นกับแต่ละทีมได้ดี งานนี้ ผจก.ทีม แมนยู ต้องหาที่ปรึกษาใหม่ครับ
ole stay please 🙏🙏🙏 🙏🙏

In my opinion Ronaldo also earned red card
We showed them mercy. It could've been 10 easily 🤣
Where is mane?
Ronaldo who?
The khabib curse. Khabib gave them bad luck.
Pendukung man united datang ke stadion hanya untuk menonton kehebatan mo salah 😁
People are like am this club and that clubs support but me  I support the club that has mo salah
Manchester united fans are cried see this 😂
No 23 menciptakan 5 gol
As MU fan, all I can say what an Amazing performance from Moh. Salah & Liverpool team. The nightmare happened again in Old Trafford, just like 2009.   Oh well...
Moh salah....best of the best
Apakah naby keita baik2 saja?
Liverpool forever. I love this team they are all SUPER STARS. MO.SALAH CONGRATS TO YOU FOR YOUR AMAZING FINISHING. GREAT WORK TEAM.
As a neutral this match went in a totally different way from what I expected
Ronaldo : I made a mistake.
Manteb tenan 5 . 0.....Paul Pogba & Penaldo tidak berkutik hanya lari2 tidak jelas .
My from INDONESIA🇮🇩 LIVERPOOL FC THE BEST
Liverpool... Kayak maen PS aja ...
Salah! Salah!! Salah!!!
No team on Universe can beat Liverpool with this performance. Super solid.
I am a Manchester United fan from SEA and I come to work with bad mood today. I accept Manchester United is an average team in EPL but I am waiting for seeing devil coming in form again even in 4 or 5 years later.

And my friends made me watch the F***ing W-Series 🤡😭
I had the weirdest dream last night that our lads scored 5 unanswered goals at Old Trafford in the first 50 min, and then made their fans watch us stroke the ball around the park for the rest of the match 😋
Manchester United hasn't uploaded their highlights video on YouTube.
tetap gw dukung cr7
Alhamdulillah
Ronaldo Get Out !!!
Its funnier to know southgate was there to watch his best national defenders
Liverpool👍👍👍👍
Salab and Keita the best duo at this match!!
En la actualidad sala es más delantero q CR7
love from INDIA TO MOH. SALAH AND CO.
I can't assist like 5th goal even in Playstation 😅
3 goals 1 assist...
Its a humiliating
Ronaldo fans umbikoo
well... the defender are all clueless.. the hole created by 23 is way too good to be true.. all the attack was created from the wings.. idk man.. idk..
💓💓💓
Where is the siuuu??😅
صلاح العالمي احسن لاعب في العالم الملك المصري
CR: free to join the great pool, take or throw?
mu ganti pelatih
Hancurrrrr mu
Great Liverpool 🥰🥰
Keita - MVP Salah - Walks on water Liverpool - Insane football
Who tf brought Maguire
There's nothing much more that I can say about Mo Salah. He is having fun scoring goals week in week out.  Klopps was absolutely right when he signed him from Roma. He is just fantastic!!!!!!!
Not a Liverpool fan but grew up in the era where they always seemed to just fall short. In an era of huge budgets and big names like Pep and Ronaldo they are showing that what matters is heart and being a unit. Bravo lads. Best team in Europe rn.
MANTAP SALAH 👍👍👍
mo Salah  mo Salah  running down the wing 🎵🎵📢 🏆🎉🎉  Liverpool was the best  who was the best player allover the world 💪⚽⚽⚽

Ole out
Henderson assist on mo remind me of that gerrard pass to sturridge 😍😍
This was a murder
Klopp looks scared when Keita get that tackle,hoping he is okay🙏
LIVERPOOL TEMPAT LATIHANNYA MEWAH BANGET
Congrats Liverpool

Poor Manchester United
❤️Liverpool ❤️King Mo
1:30. Remembered when stevie did that pass. ❤
Mantappppp 👍💪
What a shameful 4 man united
Pantes MU.dapat perlakuan memalukan begini .MANU.itu club lemah
Salah's pace is incredible !
Mooooooo Salah
Moh SALAH❤️
Pemain MU seperti kebingungan
Macguire was involved in 4 (!!) of the goals conceded. Again. How can he even captain United? No wonder the ship is sinking with Ole being unable to change course.
CALMA CALMA !!!
Mo...Salah...
Ole will not be the same level as Klopp, Tuchel or Pepe. He is clueless.
Mo salah love
MANSCUM
It was an earthquake in Manchester
Babak pertama + babak kedua = babak belur
Cr7 thaw 🤣
This game will be remembered for years
Amazing👍
This isn't La Liga where most of the teams suck and players play dirty
Happy day!!!!!🤩 Well done lads. Stay hydrated, drink lots of water, you guys are on fire! Jordan Henderson, the captain, the anchor, the brain, the mastermind!
Henderson's pass though
I feel bad to mu fans that spent his/her once in a lifetime moment watching their club in Old Trafford, and this what happened.  Respect to Harry Maguire that still showed up at the post match interview. 😀
Akan trending, segera.
Haha 7 cling has brought miracles to MU, not doing anything but the unsportsmanlike action of kicking people @@ Liv's kicking style is too high.
Can’t wait for inside Old Trafford
Almost looks perfect, Unfortunately no *Minamino* , at least sub in him on last 5 minutes before whistle blowed
United in the mud
No questions about it Ole Gunnar out.. And roenaldo be captain
What a macth
Maguire and ole = 💩
Ronaldo effect 😄
In game one wins and one lose bt from one game or ome season  Salah can't become G.O.A.T. ...  Real G.O.A.T is CR7 and Messi... They hv dominate evry season and CR7 dominated world's best 3 league... and Salah been dominated many times by CR7...  Bt for Liverpool fan Salah is Goat... bt for universal fan Cr7 and leo was and will remain G.O.A.T
🤚😆

Thats the results to not give the opportunity to CAVANI. dance dance babe.!!
Wonderful performance I was hoping you guys would go all out and score 8 but I guess that's not good sportsmanship and salah reminds me of a prime messi such a beast I love seeing manchester lose I hope Chelsea and the rest will continue the slaughter
Thank you , liverpool for getting us a new coach

YNWA indonesia
I'm going to the Manchester United team but there is no doubt that liverpool is a beast of a team
this is the result of the team not listening to the advice of its supporters
Thanks liverpool now MU fans can kick Ole out
ole stay forever
If liverpool signs Mbabe or Haland or even Harry Kane they would pay from 100 to120 mil pounds! In addition to their salaries which around 15 mil pounds a year!!!!which makes it at least 200 milions in 5 years! If they pay Salah 400k pounds weekly that would cost them a maximum 55 millions over  5 years contract!!I don’t understand why Liverpool adminst. did not renew Salah’s contract yet!!The ONE MAN SHOW gave Liverpool 15 times what was expected from him; The best Liver’s profitable deal ever had!  Give Salah what he wants !!!
🏆💪😎👍⚽⚽⚽🔥🔥🔥
OMG!!
Vamos
Modar MU
Manchester United look like Amateur
I'm glad Keita is getting his game... I knew he could do good things for Liverpool but everybody wanted him out, Klopp has been patient and it pays!
You....you....you'll never walk alone
Wkwk yellow dollar
pemain madura united nomor 5 ngapa longgar banget jagain si moh salah
Nonsence
Salah deserves the best contract extension he could ever have ! Come on Edwards
Another match another record, highest goal scorer in Africa "Mo.Salah" 🥰❤️
SALAH ANJAY
lindelof motm
annjg lah bek kontlll
In my eyes Kieta is  man of the match .literally 3 assists ! Come back stronger Naby lad !
Ndrk taina setan abang
10 man Chelsea > Liverpool > Man U + Mr.Siu

😍😍😍😍
Salah to Ballon D'or
Ganti pelatih
😍😍😍😍
You could see the body language from the Man U players after that 2nd goal and the game felt like it was over at that point, crazy. That tells you where the Man U players confidence is at right now.
😍😍😍😍
اللهم صل على محمد النبي الامي وعلى اله وسلم تسليما
Yoohoo Liverpool win
Ole OUT
Bye ole, he has to go
Thank you Liverpool players for making us feel happy tonight
Hatrick sala
Jurgen tidak salah menurunkan pemain Salah
Liverpool 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
As a United fan I’m scared to walk out of the house 😭😭
MU di senggol 5-0
Good Mohammad Salah
My day with a smile. How i want this news on my monday. Good job guys, Liverpool the best.
This season UCL finals should be between.... Liverpool vs Bayern Munich   The two BEST teams in the world currently.
As an MU fan, I do hope this match will open MU management's eyes and they start re-evaluate everything now
That through ball from Hendo for Salah's hat trick goal was pure filth. Reminded me of the ball Stevie G played for Sturridge to score away at Fulham. Peak performance.
Maguire and Shaw wss playing squid game 😀
Nothing better as a real football fan than watching Man U getting trounced.
Mohammad salah #1
Alhamdulillah m salah .oke.
they just murdered MU...🔥🔥
Hendo assist like gerrard to Sturridge
Liverpool played well and deserved to win. They have played in a disciplinary and calm way but Manchester United played in a aggressive mood. I think Red Devils are out from Premier League title.
맨유감독 밥주지마라 ㅋㄷ폭력축구 맨유.
YNWA  INDONESIA
utd fans : thanks klopp and all player.                  hope can help ole sacked.
just like messi, mo salah is a fast thinker, thus aspiring fellow liverpool players to play as fast as him which of cos requires top physical n mental fitness of all liverpool players!
Pagi ini cerah sekali 🤩
harry maguire such a clown
Perfect reds 🥳 from ind
Particularly tonight, Salah has already proven to be the BEST PLAYER in the world. He really DESERVES it.
Salah needs no introduction, he scores in every matches in every league.             Now it's Salah era 🙏♥
OLE STAY FOREVER
Klopp Out
Liverpool cheated
i hope there is no damage to our Navi Kaita :(
A very great match, thank you very much, Mo Salah and the whole team. Very nice work. I am Egyptian

So so so soooo satisfying 😌

작년에는 토트넘한테 개박살 나더니 요번 시즌에 리버풀한테 박살나네 맹구 클라스 니들 덕분에 위안이 된다.
Advantage Liverpool! "a buffet ball" I have never heard of that before. I know about a buffet restaurant, I have been to few .
Can't stop watching this highlight
Wow ..satan and devil kill each other ..
should have been red
Moh Salah was INVISIBLE to united. It’s funny how Man U did not mark Salah tight. Salah is the most lethal player in EPL and It’s like they (MU) did not consider him in their tactics, They just let him move comfortably. Congratulations Liverpool, you got the right people in your team. I remember back in 2015-2016, the team was struggling hard to play under klopp because of the intensity of the tactics. After 3 years, with the right players Klopp turned the team into European Champions.  On the other side, Ronaldo was also INVISIBLE to his own team. He was nowhere to be seen. Did he even play? 😂
Mohammed salah alhamdulillah
Everlasting hatrick
Pogba Red card,MC Arthur yellow what the premier league
Yg dislike fans Mu..
it’s not real guys..clearly it’s a gameplay of fifa 2022
salah tak pernah KALAH
Congrats liverpool you deserve win...from united fan
The best salah
Ronaldo the koyakman
Mohamed ❤️
MU lawak :D
Sempre a enfardar!
Still surprised at how many Liverpool supporters are surprised at this result. I expect nothing less and feel we are still a wip.. I wd prefer to win 1-0 with no major injuries. Get well Naby,Milner,Harvey, Thiago🤦🏿‍♂️
Terrible defense
Ole outttttttt
This weekend was a weekend of goals. Up Chelsea and up Liverpool
I would say, when it went to 3-0, manu players started to lose control and sportsmanship, like CR and Pogba. They hurt our players, just like warn us don't score again. We stopped scoring since LFC players protect themselves
YNWA
Suuuu😆😆😆😆
Salah is better than
RONALDO WHO?????
1 million in less than 5 hrs❤️❤️.. This is LFC
Mantappp
In mnceritakan ronaldo d buat barca 5:0  Dan,madrid hncur d kandang ny sndri 😅😅
Kasihan MU jadi tempat latihan stadionnya
Save ole....you are the best...😄😄😄
And people said we were going to lose...
Ina thad power
Ketika Hendo Dapat Bola, Gue: Okehh Lgsung Pencet segitiga 😅😅😅
love this game !!! That Henderson assist absolutely stunning, Mo Salah really on fire
this is what scholes predicted after UTD vs atalanta game   he said if this is UTD they will lose 4 or 5 to.liverpool on sunday  and they did
Salan on fire this year
Eh eh eh eeehhhhh
The African king 🤴 keeping up proud
I Don,t believe it,
Slaah!!
Henderson's assist reminds me of Gerrard. Incredible. YNWA
Mohamed Salah what  a player he is ❤❤❤
Yank here, so apply a 20-percent discount to what I say, but this was only one — albeit one glorious — game. To win the league, LFC still need to wring points out of Burnley, West Ham, Southampton, Leicester, ‘Villa, etc.  Maintain perspective. Keep feet on the ground.
The best match... Give them zero at old Trafford was the magnificent game for all the kops army all over the world.... They becomes The Reds Shy Devil... Haha so happy.. I can sleep well last night with a smile...
WOOH...OLE..D PECAT..
Hancurkan MU
Mo On Fire 🔥🔥🔥
SEKELAS MU DIBANTAI 5-0 NAJISS BANGET DAHH WKWKWKWK GAK GUNA

When i was watching the match, i have to double check the channel couple of time, because i thought it was comedy. 😂😂
ole + shaw please stay! 😎
Liverpool masih yang terbaik di bandingkan dengan MU, sekalipun ada Ronaldo di MU.
Ole out.
Can’t stop watching these highlights incredible ❤️❤️🔥🔥 I always known deep down even through our struggles 2007-2015 that we were indeed one of the best, to me the best club in the world Jurgen has transformed us I remember hearing rumours about him leaving Dortmund and I knew if he was coming to us he would be incredible ❤️👏🏼
Ez
for me bobby is the best.. he created a chaos in manu defender area so nicely..
De gea ari sia teh cager

Salah will never in a hundred years achieve what Ronaldo has.
Haha yes liverpool win..👏
Anjay... munyuk kebantai
YNWA liverpool 4life blood Reds. We are liverpool ❤❤💯🦍
CR7 showed his sportsmanship today.
Bravo!!! 5 times
Very refreshing Salah did a good job!!!!! by Japanese KOP
This is a charity match between liverpool and man Utd.. Not a bigmatch
David Ge....👎👎👎
Stupid Legion Devils vs the best Red ...
Wkwkwkwk 5 - 0
Yo creo que el liverpool si le anda dando una cogidota al psg viendo esto jaja
I love Liverpool ❤️
Only can say... thanks YNWA...
dua2nya aku suka tapi emang menykitkan harus ada yg kalah..apa boleh buat kuterima kenyataan .
Total demolition. I repeat TOTAL DEMOLITION. What a win and a clean sheet. Liverpool destroyed United at their backyard. Fantastic performance from the Reds. Naby, Jota and Salah x3 with the goals. A hat trick for Salah👑 what a player. Bring on Preston💪🏻 @LFC YNWA🔴
Cómo debe de ser!!! El Manyu y Papá!!! La situación esta ya de lo más normal!!!
YNWA ❤️
Pogba comes and goes
Where is CR7?
JORDAN HENDERSON best captain
FIrmino started 4 of the goals....That's how important he is to us and that's why when he isn't playing our midfield and attack can't connect
Number AAAAA.
WE'VE GOT SALAH OH JOTA JOTA AND BOBBY FIRMINOOOOOO
Bek MU lawak 🤣
Makin bagus Keita tiap laga... Mantappp.....
MU the best,
What Happens with MU ???
salah again :) ...
Amazing game so far❤️
Why always Liverpool 🤣🤣
Where Ronaldo...
Wonderful Mohammed Salah 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Mu sakit
Salah top score in EPL 2021/2022, Kovacic top Asist, and Chelsea winners EPL🔥
Ole out🧐
No varane No win
Sudah kuduga
So sad for ronaldo.. 😅😅
SALAH AGAIN !!!!
Fans MU Kalah atu Kalah sja tu
the future of Liverpool is so bright just like Firmino's tooth
Wow that Manu defence was just horrible :/ ... not to take away the nice attacking footbal of Liverpool.
Keita was amazing this game, a goal and an assist, was sad to see him get injured. Henderson with a wonderful assist, and wat to say abt mo Salah he is simply doing GOAT things!!!
Goodbye ole gunnar "silent" solksjaer..
Manchester has the worst defesa that I have seen. Liverpool knew how to approve the occharsions
M SALAH Mantap
Salah🔥👑
Salah and Lewandowski could end the reign of Ronaldo-Messi.
💥
saya orang Indonesia ingin mengatakan :   KEMENANGAN YANG BESAR  😇
Salah 👑💓🙌
Ballon d Ore engraver should start practicing Mo's name.
Easy match for liverpool
🔥👻👻
I don't even think this match is only about 65 minutes !
Kalian luar biasa
Ronaldo mal perdedor
Rip old trashford wkwkwk
Mo salah mo salah
If m u play without Ronaldo the result will be another one  I don’t say they will win but it will not be like this  Ronaldo is a great player but his team didn’t like him , they full of jealous and envy’s from him  They didn’t assist him or give him ball enough  All they do is to try to make themselves butter than him  This is a tragedy
Please just pay Salah what he wants 🙏🙏🙏
Great 7.....CR??..🙃🙃
Give Salah what ever he wants. Salah is on the wheel !
💪💖❤💖 ....off....
Pogba made the great decision to make the tackle to avoid humiliation. 🤣
Kapten nya terlalu pro
we made old trafford home...maybe we should play there every weekend
Not only stunned, he killed them completely. Some even question their existing, aome considering to support magpies and some go back straight home just to dunk a beer under shower.
You know brow....  mohd salah orang asal pahang 1kaMpung with saya....so korang ingat apa sis....😛😭😢☔🤩☔😢☔😭😭😭☔🤣🎃😓🌇⚡🚬🥰🎸🤗😛
Hari plg bersejarah untuk the kop
From the win against Atletico,I started suspecting this team.I think they are a full package.
YNWA...💪💪💪

As I am a Leicester fan I’m very happy that Man Utd lost lol
Why pogba he said at 4nd goal salah..😇

@Liverpool FC; this video requires a mature content advisory at the beginning. That was brutal - I did not realize YouTube allowed this type of content😆😆
Anjiirrr....di bantai etah MU
Stunning statistics for Liverpool FC, good hard work for a defender who didn’t give much chance to Ronaldo and Bruno.  Salah made a Liverpool and African history.  Keita shows his best and is crushed with a stretcher.
Ronaldo got award player of the month with that attitude.What a joke
Stupid defender of MU, number 5 of course.
CR0
Ini pasti salah...
Liverpool are too good
greenwood , martial , maguire , fred do they think they deserve to be de gea , MU trash management maybe there is a plan to make MU a stupid team and some are not happy if MU rises to be a strong team again in their internal
History lesson: this is the biggest win against Manchester United in either top flight league. (First Division/Premiership) the all time record remains from 12 October 1895 (Liverpool, 7-1)
ashame of soccer = Ronaldo
disappointing from Liverpool..............4-0 at halftime................should be 7-0 at fulltime...............LOL
Ole out
Mo Salah deserves to win Ballon d'Or this year.
That outside of the foot pass from Hendo, delicious!
Ini MU maunya apa sih Kog sekelas salah gtu dilepas bebas
Menangislah jika kau ingin. Jangan pernah ditahan tangisanmu. Kembalilah ke dalam goa
Siuuuu later penaldo🤣🤣

Love you guys
De gea es un chiste
INDONESIA PROUD !!
Mo salah never afraid to shoot at narrow gap and never afraid face to face with the goal keeper in a short range. He's arguably the best striker in the world right now.
😂🤦‍♂️🙈
Sem pênalti sem gol kkkk
M.salah amazing 🔥
Does the MU management have a plan to make MU a ridiculous team like Barcelona in the Koemen era?
Remember this all fanatics extremists. Salah isn't the world best player.  It's Liverpool as a team which is best.  Ex Owen, Torres, Coutinho. Salah leave LFC he will regret.
Mu lawan tim futsal sekolah ku mungkin bakal kalah juga
Lol Mo Salah smashed Man U

From a Chelsea fan, Salah is the best player in Europe.
نادي برشلونة يستخدم نفسة الحيلة نساء جاسوسات فخة الكاميرا في الغرفة
Luke was really really poor today it's like forgot how to mark sommeone
Liverpool is fantastic ,  Mohamed Salah he's  more than fantastic always
Congratulations for Liverpool🙌🙌🙌
oh man,, i liverpool fan.. but i'm respect to Man U... honestly,, i'm shock we win with big score here... i think Man U have strong squad too, especially Ronaldo there

Luke shaw makes salah very comfortable, look at even sticking to salah he can't and it's purely his fault that he looks slow and seems to have lost a player in that position, and there are still united fans who say he's better than chilly😂  Congrats to liverpool btw, salah what a player! If he keep like this he deserved ballon d'or for next season🔥
What a game
🔥🔥🔥
What a salah!!!
legenda mu bilang united tertinggal jauh dr liverpool beberapa tahun ini...bukan tertinggal...tp jauh banget...saingan liverpool sekarng city....
concerned about the injuries. 🙄
Ole stay... Said by MU opponent
Congratulations liverpool Forza milan
Liverpool champions 🏆🥇✨🎊🎉
Old trafford = Liverpool training centre
I've been waiting for us to thrash united like this since Klopp came!! What a day to be a 'pool fan
AdA CR PuN LeMaH
Salah is world best player no doubt, he do what messi and ronaldo can't do.
LoL😂😂😂
Wkwkwkw MU   Goa dulu fans MU
Sayang Ole!
لماذا مانشستر يونايتد لم يعد يحقق ألقاب لان الفرق المنافسة زرعت جواسيس في النادي ٪70 من العاملين جواسيس من مدير المالي إلى مدير رائيس النادي الاعبين أنفسهم جواسيس المدرب جاسوس او ربما وقعوا فخ مارسوا الجنس مع نساء و غرفة فيه كاميرا لا تلعب جيدا ولا سنفضحك

How is Maguire playing on such a big team like Man U, he is so fucking bad its crazy
God damn it why pogba have to do naby lad like that our #8 was playing like Gerrard for us these past few games
Senggol DONG
for a moment, can we appreciate Henderson pass ? it's amazing .
YNWA
The Egyptian king 👑
Salah alien
What an absolutely great game. And also, finally Salah scored a hat-trick.
Undeliverable Mo. He is looking to break a lot of record. First 32 goals a season. Can he opt out of the Africa Cup in Jan. he could miss 4-5 games.
United players really wanted to get Ole sacked ASAP
MENCRET UNITED 😂😂😂
Fantastic win Liverpool. For Man Utd, its been a roller coaster ride since SAF left. STOP the mix and match with your forwards' position. Full backs are not skilful enough so cross the ball in every time they go forward. You have great center forwards but you park them to the corner flags?
Awesome movement from firmino overall.. He make the united defender confused..
خلص الكلام يا صلاح بطل يبن النيل❤️🇸🇦 🇪🇬🙏🏻

Unbelievable 🔥🔥🔥

Breaking news. Man United  are going to show rest of their games on Comedy Central.😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Salah gave the 'hattrick ball' to Tsimikas that looked very happy.
Coming from an Arsenal fan I hope sala  wins the ballon
ronaldo: no penalty today, day bad
Buset deh dikandang sendiri 5-0 wkwk

💪✊
محمد صلاح أحسن لاعب فى العالم بدون مبالغة ربنا يحافظ عليه ويحميه أمين يارب العالمين
Ole is still learning and developing and has definitely become much more tactically astute he's just having bad luck atm. We have one of the best managers in the league, lets get behind him and support him. OLE IN. GGMU.
Sudah jatuh ketimpa tembok wkwkkwkw sudah kalah kena kartu merah
AAA congrast liverpool 💗💗💗
Salah Masterclass👏
and there were people who think Luke Shaw is the best left back in England
Dónde está cr7, cr7 dónde estaaaaaá 🎶
Very good👍👍👍
This was a stellar team performance everyone came on the field with a mission and determination. Well done REDS!
CR7 said, what the hell with this team
VAMOS, HACIENDO EL AGUANTE DESDE ARGENTINAAA!
Makan lah sikit nak, ntar kau sakit
Ole culprit
There's gonna be a baby boom in Liverpool nine months from today
Lets Goooo!!!

Dirtiest club in the world. Lets hope naby ladd is fine 🙏🙏
Naby keita👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
D gea k chụp luôn
Mcguire plays a great deal in all of the goals of Liverpool. Such poor awareness and marking. Doesn't really deserves the captain's armband. Totally overpriced
Salah 👏👏👏
Ole good Job👎
Duh eung, kakarek ge arek rada miang miang MU teh, eh kalah dibantai. 🥺 tapi da emang liverpool na alus euy, kudu diakui eta teh.
Nice salah
The dislike is from man united fans lol
Ole must stay...

Mo salah👍👍👍
ابو مكه مشرف مصر
On fire (emot epi) (emot epi)
Bravo Moh salah
CR7😪😴😴😴
Thank you salah
Man Utd's structure and defense was like Brazil's against Germany in WC 2004. Total chaos.
how mu so 😓..maybe their player is to many old player
500 Million arabs are Liverpool supporters !! 500 million prayers that is the key 😂😂
Kalah 1-0 2-1 atau 3-2 itu wajar,tapi kalo sampai 5-0 kalah nya pelatih memang tidak punya mental juara
Kasihan MU 😭
Sekarang eranya Mo Salah
..... SENSATIONAL, utterly buzzing here!!! Thank you, lads, fer so MUCH JOY, TODAY!!! 😍😍😍
كنت على وشك ان أعقد صفقة مع شركات الألعاب الفيديو عام 2020 ولكن مندوبين الشركات لم يأتوا اظن الخبل خرب الصفقة
I think de gea bad performance
At the moment, Mo Salah is the best player in the world! Congratulations from 🇵🇹 on your victory Reds
King Mo👑
Klopp: yeayyy...whoaahhhhh..yeessssss...niceee...ok,stop...stop..he's already dead..salah stop!salahhhh..oh gosh
Jurgen chose an easy game for Konate to gel with Virgil.

MU looks like mediocre 😀

I love Liverpool ❤️ the best salah 👏
keep ole on his position,everyone in this universe loves ole even more.. YNWA
OLE OUT
Pogba is a punk.
huge respect for LFC players for not scoring after Pogba was sent off. In the history books it’s already written that LFC won and scored all the 5 goals when Man.United had its all 11 players and big names playing the game. Period !
I literally said that the score will be 5-0, before the game LMAO
one of my favourite games i've ever watched lmao. not the absolute best in terms of quality and competitiveness, but so so fun to watch utd get embarassed 😆
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Salah is Legend ☢️🔥 but English Commentary is the worst🤢 Listen to Arabic or Spanish and enjoy ^_^
Absolutely from henderson...word class passing for mo salah...
أبو صلاح يا مشرفنا👏🏻👏🏻
Salah is the best ❤️❤️❤️
Great football Clubs Liverpool
Where is Cr7 ?
Shaw the centerback
Sopir angkot vs pebalap f1
CR7 was pissed bruh lmao
Cr7 is the best 😂😂😂😂
What a game.. Salah class

What a great day for manchester united.
محمد صلاح افضل لاعب في العالم

De gea kacau
Moh Salah just score because his player. He does not compare with CR7. CR7 still the best player.
Outclassed outplayed YNWA❤️
تحيا مصر✌️❤️
Either Chelsea or Liverpool gonna be champion this season..
solskjaer out
❤️
Amazing.....
Huh, didn't know Liverpool changed their training ground to Old Trafford
Salah brother love from. Algeria 💖💖
How Ronaldo and Fred weren't also sent off baffles me but 5-0 ain't bad
Seperti ketika main pes dan pilih lawan bintang 1
ole should stay in ManUtd  at least for 10 more seasons 😂
Glory glory man united
Salah oh salah.. Ole stay.. hahahaha 😂
Ynwa
I think ole and maguire should be replaced by more useful ones in the field
Handerson.keiyta sangat mengusai lapangan
ผีแดง.อย่าหวังจะได่แชมย์เลยครับ.ตามหลังลิเวอร์พู.ห่างกันมาก
Salah is a machine but let's take another look at that pass from Hendo.  Outside of the boot, weighted to absolute perfection, inches around a defender to the boot of ..... The Machine!
Bangang McGuire
Mate i live in Australia and had to wake up at 2:30am just to watch the match, but oh man, I wasn’t disappointed at all, it bloody worth it!! Love this team forever!!
Ronaldo is definitely sulking in pity
Not a Liverpool fan but have to admit this Liverpool Sqaud is tight. They are just too good. Premier league is fortunate enough to have Klopp and Pep Guardiola who not only makes the team score plenty of goals but makes them plays and attractive brand of football. Which is such a treat to watch... 👏👏
MU sehat?
I can’t ask more than this, What a Performance! What A Team! The Reds is the first color in English football before some add devil to their own red . This Is A Result for Generations to come . We Are Liverpool   This Means More ❤️❤️❤️
what ronaldo did to curtis jones was appalling😠. I don't believe he didn't get a straight red
Oh mg
Others: liverpool plays very well Me: MU did very worse
Damnn back to back 5-0  games
Liverpool fans and I love Mohamed Salah
Wow! El Liverpool está jugando a otro nivel!
where is krishna Ronaldo ?!!!!
Salah sending a message to Ronaldo saying: "I guess now you know who is the boss in this house called the premier league"
Salah mulu, dah lah.
Does Liverpool want Salah to play for them or against them , this Liverpool team would probably be one of the best attacking Liverpool teams ever.
Moh salah moh salah moh salah running down the wing..👑👑👑
I love you liverpool❣️and I love you Mooo salah❣️ I from Indonesian🇲🇨❣️
Amazing...  lfc😍
Haha nice joke..
Ronaldo was in the game, but only 1 legend can shine out.
Salah better than ronaldo
Good god salah, what a player, Chelsea City Liverpool title race like 2014 will be interesting
إلى نادي ليفربول .. إياكم أن تكرروا أخطاء الأندية الأخرى التي فرطت في محمد صلاح ثم ندمت . Take care Mohamed Salah is the best player in the world nowadays
Nyesal gak kau dodo ke Munyuk 😂
Salah>Neymar
Salah tidak pernah mengecewakan
El liverpool llegando a old tranford: hoy se folla
Sheer delight for Liverpool
I have no regret to have you like my favorite team. I fall in with you since 2005. Your number one haitian fan ! You will never walk alone
Ole out
It’s good to see Naby Keita back in form 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Salaaaaaaah
Livorno skrg Kencang sekali.. Pemain spiter semua 😂
Liverpool BEST IN THE WORLD.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻   Luar biasa Mo Salah
Salah... Best player
Ada yg dari indo ga bro
Congrats all Liverpool squad. Each of all persons has contribution. Great team. Love from Indonesia
Funny 🤣
As an Ajax fan, I'd like to congratulate Liverpool for this win. You guys look like one of the best teams this season. Honesty, I'd be quite worried if we do end up going against Liverpool in the champions league ( if we both qualify passed the group stages), because in my opinion liverpool is the main team I wouldnt want us to play.
Woow salah
😂😂😂... Liverpool
OLE OUT
Incredibly satisfying!! Great performance by Liverpool! Absolutely smashed it!
YNWA my man mo
Mo Salah has 20 goal involvement in 12 games so far this season.
Salah terbaik!
Unbelievable I am a Liverpool fan an I don't believe it
Ole out.. Ole out
Oh my good, what a lesson they got taught today. Manchester even if they wanted they wouldn't be able to perform that kind of football. Ole makes to many bad decisions these days.
Alhamdulillaaahhh....
Change manu coach or defenders & also this stupid young talent greenwood never pass the ball this guys are not made for big games they don’t know how to use cr7 the GOAT very disappointment results i have ever seen in my life🤷🏻‍♂️🚶🏻‍♂️
Haha
Yes, lads. This was excellent.
Hahahaahaa....maguire lord
If Pogba cares about the game as much as he cares for his hair style he'd be the best of all and of course the sleeves don't forget the sleeves only he's got one long and one short I mean who does that !? So dope
Mo Salah is the best striker🤗
_In his entire career, at no point C.Ronaldo was as good as Mohammed Salah is right now.._  Don't @ me, y'll know it to be true..
Mantap mohammad salah, tetap d liverpool
Did he just say that’s a bobbler
Awesome performance. Thanks to killing red devil😭
❤️🦁🇸🇳 sadio Mané
Muhammad salah
Lini belakang sangat bobrok
Inalillahi wa innailaihi rojiun...
Luke shaw kayak gak main ....
Pogba: Dis Henderson guy is copying me. He has no honour.
I still want to see ole stay for another match against Liverpool 😁
Thank you for Liverpool‘s help
Ole OUT!
De gea jadi kaya kiper amatiran karena bek MU tidak sekuat Rio Ferdinand Dan Nemanja Vidic ...
This is embarassing 😭
If cr7 have good teamwork like realmadrid i think them won sure
محمد صلاح 💪💪💪
Sensational Mohammed salah 😍😳
Love Salah
I didn't have any idea here is an adult page
Moncroot MU
Liverpool were very respectful after the 5th goal. They could've scored many more goals if they really wanted to. Gentlemen!
beasts
Hahaha Kasihan Kasihan Kasihan
Best game of the season, the one i look forward to the most. Man United vs Liverpool.  Winning on their turf makes me smile. Amazing performance reds!
Moh salah Moh salah 👏👏👏👏
Mo Salah TO Barcelona

Easy Game ☺
Maguire man of the match 😂😂

This wasn't even a challenge for LFC. Man U totally collapsed after the first goal. YNWA🙂
Amazing
Jangan Salahkan SALAH jika dia terlalu overpower 😂😂  Salam dari Indonesia 🔥
Kasihan Ronaldo...... Solkjear out 😆😆
And EA dropped Salah's rating in Fifa this year 😂
Did anyone get the license plate of that truck? Man United was run over.
I'm a MU fan, and Liverpool played excelent, all team help each other, great performance.
صلاح جبتي العز خوي عشت ودمت فخرا لبلدك مصر والعرب جميعا😎
What happened to Penaldo? LOL
Mo la
LIVERPOOL DEADLY
I still waiting for cristiano red card... XD
Spanked, that is all!
Mohammed Salah, what a player! My goodness. He better get a extraordinary raise in his contract renewal.
king mo salah❤❤
Pogba and the red mist moment.
Yeeessss, hancurkan MU
Mantap surantap Mo Salah, dgn 'hattrick'nya dan 'cleansheat'nya Allison, bikin Emyu kayak 'tikus' dipermainkan kucing ......  😂 Bravo the Reds, YNWA .....  👍
Liverpool is unstoppable🔥 Salah ✌💜
Pemain bawahnya,, lemah
Game of the century.
Salah is the goal machine.

If salah wants to higher salary, man he deserved it, hope he will get ballon d or someday
Propper snottin ' that .
Woooooooow....... 5 - 0
ok, Salah... this is your new contract 📙  ... oh yeah, for the salary and bonus, just write it by yourself...!
Man u  defense is horrible Lindelof & Maguire make a bad pair & it has been showing for a long time now when Keane talked about shaw , maguire & de gea ,when lindelof & bruno fernandes got angry at each other .. Maguire is not always constant & ive never seen lindelof cover him or do anything good really lol
Mo Salah.....Mo Salahh..!!   ✊
Wowwwww

Jamaah mang ujangiyyun tolong masok goa dengan tertib ya.
Sols has to go. No coaching should be in this bad position. Accept responsibility. Tighten the loose screws and get the machine working!!!!. Get a coach to make solid players. Too much amateur things happening. Cudos to Salah
Stuns
Salah:3 shot 3 gol CR:3 shot all on Jones custis
Manchester united defender🤣🤣
As a MAN U fan.  wanna thank Mo Salah for stop scoring after the fifth goal tell the end of the match.

AMAZINGLIVERPOOL
Waiting for ManU upload his highlights.. :V
moooooooooooo Salah
As a life long pool supporter, pure delight,  3 things today,  1 Ronaldo should have been sent off for his childish behaviour against jones,  2 United supporters should be applauded for clapping when keita carried off in a stretcher,  3 pogba unlucky with the red card , he didn't go in to damage with keita
JAJAJA PAUL POGBA
Mo Salah.. Please stay in Liverpool we are all love you, so proud of you.. The greats player..
Yeah Salah is the best but that Hendo pass for 4th goal its insane.

And CR7? 🤣
This was a team performance salah didn't score a hatrick by himself the team played as a one , an absolute beautiful performance and then to just play about with united after the nabi injury was so funny , they are the BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD
Salah : too Easy for Hattrick 😁
Love tsimikas at the end😂😂😂❤️🤣❤️
Messi los 2-8 dengan bayern Ronaldo los 0-5 dengan liverpool.   Sama2 pernah mersakan di bantai wkwkwkw
If Mohamed Salah tell you that the best player his Leonel Messi and you come to play agains him,, that is what will hapen to you
Everyone before the game said ronaldo will score a hatrick and liverpool fans will cry now who's crying 🤣🤣
Mana nih penaldo
Give Salah any money he’s asking for. Plz don’t be misers n let Salah leave the club like Wijnaldum
Lol Liverpool crushed Man U what I like to see!
I love the fact that ManUTD's YT channel hasn't even uploaded this. They didn't upload their AVFC loss neither. So much shame i guess 😂  They only upload wins.
Give him new contract today... ASAP !
Ole outttt
Tactic ole is too old and monoton
Thank you mr. salah you make ole a LOT more easier to get sacked🙏🙏

Pembantaian
Henderson giving Salah the same assist Salah gave Mane against Watford . Amazing pass with the outside of his boot through the defense like a knife through butter 😁
Is it no Highlight from Manchester United?
Can we get an ‘all angles’ video of Salah’s third goal… for the Hendo ball 😍🔴🔥
🔴🔴🔥ynwa🔥
good decision by klopp cooling down at 5-0, or they will break everyones of us legs
Amazing Mo Salah hattrick 👍👍👍

Kok bisa sebanyak ini ya Goal nya padahal MU ya bisa di bilang tim besar
Whaaajhaa
Hiring Klopp as manager is the best idea Liverpool has had in decades.
Munyuk ni boss senggol Donk
What is the difference between taxi and MU depender?  Taxi only lets 4 in.. 😎
Historic match, it could easily have ended 7-0. Maybe they slowed down a bit because of Pogba's criminal kick to Keita
Wow! What a match! 5-0! Salah hat-trick + goals by Keita and Jota.
Salah is legend 🔥
we have a new g.o.a.t
Alhamdulillah. Salah
I am very proud of you, mo Salah, son of my country, Egypt I wish you success always as you raise the name of my country in the next World Cup

It's ok...there are so many games ahead. Man Utd will win many games after this. Liverpool and Chelsea will begin to suffer loses. Man City will never be a contender for champion. Table will turn. MU will win the crown.
Salah is the next Ronaldo
lord maguire tidur aja, ga jelas 🤣🤣
Let Mo stay at the Anfield...no regrets...
Saya sebagai fans Real Madrid mengucapkan selamat untuk Liverpool telah memenangkan pertandingan melawan Manchester United.
Man U for Life...
Alhamdulillah... 🤲
We manucian too never see everything like this. congratulations Liverpool
Mohamed salah love
Liverpool stop their attack after min 60. I know MU had no soul to play after the red card.
This is a sweet gift on my birthday🥳🥳🥳
Thanks for the video
Liverpool to win tetrapuple this season
When a professional team plays against d kids.
no salah no party...yes salah yes party
Brilliant assist from captain 💪
Keita had a phenomenal game as well next to Salah, involved in so many of the goals. Just amazing to watch.
Tidak salah lagi kalo salah yg terbaik
Made Man Utd's defence look like a bunch of amateurs, Liverpool were absolutely ruthless, so clinical, just hope they can keep this up until the end of the season.
😭😭 its okay
I remember that C.Ronaldo never lose such 0-5 result as his club & national team ever
Gokil
صلاح ياااا جاحد لا ترحم اي فريق 💪💪💪 ١٠٠مليون مصري مشجع لليفربول 💪💪💪
Ole stay
Mo Salah 🔥
could salah get the ballon d'or  if he continue this? i hope so.
*This one will be remembered for a long time* _Mo Salah is the best in the world, and Naby Keita is simply stunning hope both of them stays for the longest time_
Give Ole 10 Years contract....😂
United has been rapedd🤪
One season wonder 🙄🤪😝
Good job liverpool
Ronaldo couldn't kick the ball in so he just kicked Jones instead
Idk why this liverpool player training at Old Trafford ?? Anyone can told me 💀
Salah is one season wonder. But for every season.
0 - 5 😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣
✔ Salah hat trick ✔ Hendo beautiful pass to salah ✔ Konate was class today. Goes home with Ronaldo in his back pocket. (and my favorite part when he push that bruno away, after that bruno dare to push virgil).  poor keita.
120 million Egyptians were encouraging Liverpool because mo Salah we loved this 120 million Egyptians were encouraging Liverpool because of mo Salah we loved this club Liverpool ❤️🇪🇬❤️🇪🇬❤️🇪🇬❤️
Masha allah mo salah 👏🏻👏🏻, 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 masha allah mo salah 👏🏻👏🏻,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 mooo salahhhhh 😍😍😍😍😍😍
We should pay more attention to that magnificent Hendo assist as well, was a thing of beauty leading to the fifth at Old Trafford.
If Salah leaves,there will be riots at Merseyside
So happy today
Give new contract for Mo Salah!!!! Just give him what's he wants.
United exposed as the dirty team they are today. No fans applauded Keita as he was stretchered off. Ronaldo a disgrace. United got everything they deserved. Horrible club
🤣🤣
Apik tenan 😄
What a difference when we have a midfield player pushing forward. We need it more.
Tak perlu banyak komen ,cukup Tayangan ulangnya gua putar" sampe puluhan X, puas banget gua,😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I like this
Arsenal fan here but love the way Liverpool attack. Coaching matters and individual brilliance matters. Mo is at his best again because the defense is at its best again.
Hehehe tak berkutik sama sekali ki piye jal mas brooo
Ole out🤬😡
Salah gendeng..!!!!
PADUUUUUU!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Kesian ronaldo
OLE STAY UNTIL MAN UNITED Degradation
Very fantastic...
Muhammed Salah. Winner ballon d'or 2022
Salah the best player in world 👑☝️💪🔥
Loves this, while Man Utd fans, ex players and club continue to support their legend Ole blindly. Hopefully they continue to keep their legend while the rest of the top epl clubs  continue to progress.
Aaaaaaaqhahahhahahahah

Munyuk mampus

Munyuk ko
This guy should be balloon d'or contender behind lewandowski
Mr.Pogba is bad action, he is cry baby and a litlle by litlle will  be not good performance. Congratulation for my kind football club is Liverpool.

Mohamad salah muss gewinnen die Zeichnung als bester Spieler der Welt dieses Jahr .absolutely amazing player 💪💪
ابن بلدي فخر العرب 💪❤️
Save ole
Mo Salah is absolutely amazing! But let's all appreciate the rest of the squad! Keita was sensational! Firmino was elegant! Jota and Henderson with their goal and assist respectively were astonishing! Trent and Robbo were glorious! Our defense especially Van Dijk and Konate were absolute class! Curtis stepping up instead of Milner and giving it his best is courageous! Milner himself was awesome for the first 15 minutes he played! Mane and Oxlade were wonderful when they came in! I'm very proud of this team! ❤️
6 kartu kuning + 1 kartu merah Kenak bantai 0-5 di kandang sendiri  Fans munyuk menderita lihat tim ya di permalukan🤣
From Malaysia saying this “Liverpool are on fire!” Congrates for them. Mosalah! 🤩❤️🇲🇾
Moh. Salah is the best
Mohammad Salah 💜💜
Salah is the best in the world 👑
Watching man utd defend is like watching a horror movie.
Great  Liverpool
Bir kaç tane altın ayakkabı ödüllü futbolcu vardı sahada, o nerede? 🤣
AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA, bruh everyone were talking that Man united will be favourites to win pl and liverpool will be under a quastion if they will be at top 4. All I can say Cr7 overrated, mufc fans deluded, Salah like prime messi bullying million worth trees.
Great team work 👏, mo salah deserve Ballon d'or this year
Salah The One Career Wonder Alhamdulillah
I enjoyed that match way more than I should
Salah ballon d or 2021

Yesssssssss My Team Liverpool FC Mo Salah ⚽⚽⚽ 1️⃣1️⃣ 🇪🇬 💞💝❤️❤️💕 Happy
Salah the best in the world 💖💖💖
Am I the only one who is a bit disappointed we took the foot off the gas with about 30 minutes left. We could have stuck a proper cricket score on the Mancs today.
thank you Liverpool 💙
I think is now Zidane to manage Man united
Selawak lawaknya Barca ternyata masih lebih lawak MU
Manu như 1 con nai ngơ ngác
United defensive is so poor and too exposed lol hahaha...varane and maguire the two world class🤣🤣😅

Maguire 😂😂😂
Grande Salah, se perdió el mundial una lastima , uno de los mejores del mundo pero para estos jugadores los que eligen no les importa , les encanta el sentimentalismo eligiendo a un tronco como cr7
Looked like Pogba was the prob after he was sent off they didn’t concede any🤔😢
Come on Liverpool......we City wanna play against Ole's United too! Don't sack him already!
main man united kaya liga tarkam apa lagi lini belakangnya
Mujaer bingung si ole juga bingung yang penting bisa ketawa, tetap di munyuk pan japa

Oldie (ronaldo) and ole should retire

Fans MU cry in the cave
MU does not play as a team, coupled with the poor individual skills of the defenders.
Liverpool is a wicked team. You guys didn’t let Ronaldo to even score a consolation goal. Because of you Alex Ferguson and Ole won’t sleep tonight 😂😂😂

Anjir mu jadi ayam geprek
Score a goal in the Champions League champion Chelsea. He scored a goal in Man City, the runners-up. He scored two goals in the Spanish champion. Record three historic in Man United. That is why we will give the Ballon d'Or award... to Benzema or Messi😂😂😂
Salah ...Amazing...mo salah...mo salah
Where are the CRY Andora fans now...Salah really silenced this Mr Lithuania supporters..lmao **Only OG CR7 fans will understand.
صلاح أفضل لاعب فى العالم بلا منازع  ربنا يكرمك فى اللى جاى
Mooooooooooo❤️
It would be ridiculous if Salah didn't win the 2022 Ballon d'Or.
I kinda feel sorry for them, we were in the same boat at one point last year v Aston villa  Still YNWA though
If this month's player of the month is not salah then I can think we can all boycott the award.  This is the best Liverpool game. They are so hungry, everyone wants to attack and score. In this form, they can easily tear up any team.  Simply incredible.
we're just living in Salah's world and everybody knows it
King mo👑
Remember when we said can we play Watford every week? United took it literally
Ha ha ha 5/0
Liverpool is so ruthless and savage this season, simply love it❤🔴
Gile lu ndro.....
they slap the hell out of man u
M. Salah 3 goal, lalu salahnya dimana ???
What does he allow himself, a player of 4 seasons?
Maguire the best centre back
SALAH 👍
ole anjing
Jir langsung upload , mantaap
Naby keita is improving by the with every match 💯
Pemain dari jepang ga main, jadinya ga asyik
I was not a football fan before, but when Mohamed Salah went to Liverpool and I saw him in the Roma match I loved Liverpool I loved Firmino forever I loved Robertson so much And I loved Virgil van Dyck how great he is and I love the style of the German Juergen Klopp His Excellency I will always love him and finally Mo Salah I don't know the names of the players in Egypt but I know all the Liverpool players 😂😂❤️
محمد صلاح افضل لاعب في العالم
Salaaaaaaaaaa,going down the wing!!!
Congrats you guys deserve it because of the shitty way we play

Wowoww
OMG Mo Salah ❤❤❤
Different level
Mohamed Salah deserves to be the best player in the world this year The time of Ronaldo and Messi is over. It is the era of Mohamed Salah 11 Who agrees with me?
And Penaldo???
You’ll never walk alone
Mohammed salah, assalamu'alaikum... From Indonesia. Liverpool Mantapp 👍
Everybody saying Cristiano or Leo is the best  But in fact, Mo is the MVP
The best day of my life. 😻😻
How could Pogba still smiling after beaten 0-5 and given that red card? That's how rubbish MU is today...😄
My friend was crying beside me during this game
Salalalhhhhhh the EGYPTIAN KING ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Terlalu mudah hhhhh
Salah is geting closer to the legends.  Who would you rather buy?
Where is ronaldo...? He is crying?
Ini kemenangan yg masih saja kita membayar mahal untuk itu, semoga saja tidak ada yang cidera parah dan semua pemain sehat semua
tolong kepada pihak yt liverpool, Kasih peringatan ke video ini, spapnya mengandung unsur pembantaian heuheuheu
One word: MO SALAH🔥👑

Mo Salah is the best of the best on this moment

What's the difference between de Gea and a tax driver? Taxi driver only let 4 in
Ole out
Mantap Liverpool
OMG 😱😱😱
M Salah.... 💯💯💯💯💯
Things are definitely coming together right now. Rest of the premier League and Champions league must be worried considering we weren't at our best either.   Salah is definitely the best player in the world right now.   And our 4 forwards make up the top ten premier League top goalscorers so far this season.  Salah-10 Mane-5 Firmino-4 Jota-4  And we remain the only unbeaten team. Just need to win every game up until the 2nd January and try and beat Chelsea, then let's dream again
YNWA
Liverpool to strong 🔥
Salah has to be the best in the world at the moment.
Que surra 🤣
Mo Salah the best player in the world now. If you believe give me a thumb up
Cr7 likes
Ole number one haha
What a historic result, Salah is the best in the world right now 👏👑
What a match. What a game. Momo Salah is absolutly King of the business
Sensasional....
That “Oh God!” before the first goal, hilarious 🤣 🤣 🤣
It could have been 8 or 9 to 0 but Klopp said to his players to be lenient and not to humiliate more Manchester United. Infact in the last 20 minutes Liverpool has just made ball possession without attacking. Klopp is a lenient and respectable man👏 he decided to respect the history and the fans of a big club, otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster
Messi had suffered too much in the feet of Liverpool, now it’s Cr7's turn. Everyone has a turn at FC Klopp.!
Mo Salah is a real goal machine
Great win lpool fan let's get really here oily hasn't a clue wot he's doing give him 10 year deal he's a joke man City will kill them can't wait
Ronaldo has finally ruined man utd
Good matches Liverpool boys👍👍
Sometimes I can't help but wonder if Mo Salah is the expected Mahdi?
موووو صلاااااح 😍😍😍
🤣🤣🤣
1:32 pro-level vision and passing🔥
Paul Pogba should be suspended
Nice play
RUTHLESS ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
WOUUUWWW....SALAH THE BEST DESTROYER

I just love this team! Please take me to play with you 😫😅❤️✌🏼👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻 I’m an architect but because of Mo Salah I got addicted to football 😜

Well done Liverpool,from a Utd ...well fan 😱. Easy training day for you.
Konate is always a missing solid piece at the back if konate plays with vandijk you can be sure of clean sheet with no doubt. Thanks to konate 👌🙏

⚽ vs. Chelsea ⚽ vs. Leeds ⚽ vs. Milan ⚽ vs. Palace ⚽ vs. Brentford ⚽⚽ vs. Porto ⚽ vs. Man City  ⚽ vs. Watford ⚽⚽ vs. Atlético Madrid ⚽ vs. Man Utd  Mohamed Salah has now scored in TEN consecutive games for Liverpool. 🤯
WE ARE LIVERPOOL FOREVER 🔥🔥🔥
It should be 10-0 😅😂
Wow
Give Salah what he want!!
Henderson to Salah had Gerrard to Torres vibes
awsome liverpool
Manchester united Know Same Like Arsenal??? ( Another Jokes)🌝🤣
ALHAMDULILLAH MOHAMMED SALAH 👍💪
5-0 win at Old Trafford. Salah's hattrick. And it's only two minutes long?  C'mon LFC, why so lazy? Even Watford's YT channel shows extended replay vs us last week.
Salah makes everything look easy!🤾‍♂️
OLD TRAFFORD We came. We scored. We conquered.  Ladies and gentleman...the REDS 🔴💪🔥
Mo Salah  The best player in the world .. ♥️ Greetings from Egypt ✌
Salah is the best player I the world right now no cap
HAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!
Salah's brilliance hides Ronaldo
Mohammed Salah is the best player in the world
lagi jelek2nya MU.
Yg dislike fans mu mampir kesini juga, ngapain 😂
We should take time to appreciate what ibrahima konate did today. He silence both Ronaldo and rashford. He did really well today.
Best team in the league, it's a joy to watch you play. I hope City can keep up with you so we can have a nice season with good football. Btw, you wanna trade Salah for Mahrez? :/....
MVP MAGUIERE🤣🤣🤣
Mo Salah now is the best football player in the universe
ان محمد صلاح فخر مصر والعرب يعيش ازهي سنينه مع الريدز بالتوفيق يا نجم العالم حاليا 👍❤💪
Message sent. Big win, three points.  Loved King Kenny’s smile  We push for number 20.
Akhirnya MU GK berkutik 😂😂😂
De Gea es una basura de portero, por qué no dejaron que se lo.llevara el RM?!?! No puede ser que un equipo pitero como el Liverpool les haya metido 5 goles!!!.....no nada más la liga MX hace de las suyas
Salah the best...Cr7 the goat...Ole out...
Terbantai 😂
Hit the f***king " like " button if you believe Salah is the best player in the world and is capable of smashing anybody , anytime anywhere at the very moment
Smart pass from robertson 1:16
Where was Cristiano Ronaldo?!! Hahaha xD xD xD
Salah is too hot at the moment, best player in the world
Tsimikas is like a child getting the ball from a father (Mo Salah)😂
Salah : ballon for EnshAllah
The best player in the world.  He is the king of Egypt
Liverpool nih bos
Should’ve shown the clip of Alex Ferguson snd Sir Kenny Dalglish 😂🤣
What a Performance🔥🔥🔥
Salah mostruoso!!!!!!
Salah isi the best❤️👍👍👍
Old trafford (bukan era lo lagi)
alhamdulilah liverpool 5 manchester utd 0 buuuu you never walk alone
please stop United fans Patience is running out😃😄😁😆🤣
Ha ha ha the pinky devils..
Mo Salah The best player in the planet, beautiful skill and nice shoot
Humiliation at old trafford🤣🤣🤣 Give Salah new contract already ...
Superb performance by keita.. amazing liverpool
Amazing
محدد صلاح أفضل لاعب فى العالم انه الملك المصرى🇪🇬❤🇬🇧
Woooow
That was a perfect demolition job by Liverpool.  Well played to them.  For United, they better wake the hell up before heading into the abyss.
Salahuddin al aegypt i
Dedicado a los madridistas de corazon
Mohamed salah 💓
nvm, Salah should won ballon d'or next year.
It is interesting to see how close the players are to one another. Just look at Jota's goal, he and Firmino are supposed to be "rivals" fighting for the same position, yet Firmino is the one who first goes to hug Jota when Jota scored, which I honestly think plays a big role in the team's performance.
What an amazing game.. just to recall CR AND MESSI THOSE two greatest players of all times were struggle to survive in the own league.. i thinks they should move to others league such as display lite league instead of UEFA league.. this time is others times.. somehow they are goat all times ... Credit to mo salah...
The red card to Pogba was a blessing in disguise for United, Liverpool stopped playing after that. 11 vs 11 and it would have been more goals for Liverpool
Salah is a magnificent He deserves the Ballon d'Or🥇
I ask the management of Liverpool Club, my beloved team and my love since childhood, to send me an invitation to see the Egyptian king playing for my favorite team. I hope that the administration will agree or any fan will send me an invitation to attend 🇪🇬❤🇬🇧
Still don't know why we stopped scoring after that Red card🤔🤔.. We could have scored at least 7
Manchester get mash by Liverpool even the coach shell shock no press conference they will fire the coach Ronaldo frass out Paul red card
haha! have that
😂😂😂
This is our new 1-4. Still miss me some Torres+Gerrard though
I think that Liverpool spared Manchester United from more goals because he was able to do so, but liverpool show merrcy for children and women who support their club, so they should be grateful🙏
All the Manchester fans dislike
Ezz banget liverpooll beknya MU pada Afk tu apalagi si maguire behh klass sekali lah skillnya 👍👍
What a game
Gak tega gue cuk nontonnya
Mo Salah! Mo Salah! Mo Salah! Running down the wing!  Mo Salah la-la-la-la-ahh, The Egyptian King!
👍
the most unlucky man on earth now is the one who downgraded Mo Salah in EA to 89  😂😂
@ManchesterUnited
What a roller coaster it has been for me and my desire for Keita to succeed.  I hope his injury isn't' serious.  He was spectacular today, a complete make up game for his less than stellar showing vs ATM.  Let's go mighty REDS!!  We have no money, but we're coming for the league and the CL!!!
Godo
mo salah
0:22 sorry can't stop laughing
Liverpool playing like a well oiled machine while Man U forgot how to play football.
Salah is the best player at this time
2022 b'lon d'or Mohammad Salah 🎖️🏐 insha Allah
Liverpool and Pakistan both winning today was a good day
مبروك ليفربول الفريق بقيادت كلوب اده مباراة جميلة ومحمد صلاح اثبت هو الفظل في العالم في الوقت الحالي
Alhamdulillah menang 😘Mu kok kurang girang main ya😅😅
محمد صلاح نتمنى أن يستمر للقب أفضل لاعب في العالم 2022

Man U = Watford Same score line.
Mo.salah 🇪🇬💪⚽👍🇪🇬❤️
amazing.....the great team
MAMPUS COK HAHAHAHAHA
As an Arab, I am extremely proud of my brother Mohamed Salah as he further proves the doubters wrong and is currently one huge figure that connects two parts of the world that needed connecting.
Where's penaldo 🤡 and pruno penades
massacre
Mo salah ⚽⚽⚽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
I'm blessed to witness  this, really golden time of a Liverpool, I can only pray that in the future another team like this would form. Right now I'm so happy that we won Man United, 0-5, it's a dream come true. Thanks for the victory LIVERPOOL, YNWA
I'm a Spur fan but I'm impressed by your performance, turning Old Trafford into Anffield. Worthy of being a championship candidate and one of the strongest teams in the world.
Salah is skyrocketing now
Norwich looking sharp today. Much better from them than usual.
Kieta always good 👍
OLE OLE OLE
Nice, but how was that a red? 😂
Muitos ainda dizem que CR7 voltou pra um time que vai brigar por todos os campeões kkkklll...  Não vai ganhar nada pq não tem jogador que possa competir com times grandes
What a pass from Hendo
Anjay terbantai....
"he's smashing goals for fun"
ez
Konaté is very good
The commentator has no reaction on Salah's hat-trick lol. It was a historic moment.
Mo Salah legend of Liverpool
they have the worst manager in Premiere League, you're nothing special😴
Is Keita injured?
Gave him what he want
الله أكبر والحمد لله الله أكبر والحمد لله الله أكبر والحمد لله وما شاء  الله تبارك الرحمن الرحيم الملك القدوس عليك يا ابن بلادي يا غالي بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم قل أعوذ برب الفلق من شر ما خلق ومن شر غاسق اذا وقب  ومن شر النفثت في العقد ومن شر حاسد اذا حسد صدق الله العظيم  أعوذ لك بكلمات الله التامات من شر ما خلق يا محمد صلاح بسم الله الذي لا يضر مع  اسمه شئ في الأرض ولا في السماء وهو السميع العليمنعوذ بك من الهم والحزن  والعجز والكسل والجبن والبخل والكفر والفقر والمرض ونعوذ بك من ظلمة الدين  أو قهر الرجال أو ظلمهم  اللهم احفظه فوق الأرض وتحت الارض ويوم العرض عليك يا ارحم الراحمين اللهم أحفظه بين يديه ومن خلفه وعن يمينه ومن شماله ومن فوقه ونعوذ بعظمتك ان  تغتاله من تحته وصلي الله علي محمد وعلي أهله وصحبه وسلم تسليما كثيرا
Norwegian Bruce in!
Caralho, 5 a 0 em pleno old trafford, o Liverpool não tá pra brincadeira nesse ano
Naby 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Manchester United is the best in the epl! But that was 15 years ago...
Genius Salah !
Cr7 itu sudah tua. Waktunya jadi penasehat klub
Hope Keita will be able to come back soon! He's brilliant.
ربنا يحفظك يامحمد صلاح
Again again and again Mo salah MPV. Dan sekarang dia membuktikan siapa yang terbaik!!! Ronaldo harus mengakui sekarang bukan usia emasnya lagi.
Ronaldo?????
That ball boy so happy :)
Mo Salah. son of my country ❤🥰 Congrats to Liverpool Congrats to Mo
I've watched this about 10x now. And I watched the full match.
Wow, what a result!  I was nervous when I saw the line up and Matip, Fabinho were missing, but how good was Konate?
Ok but CHELSEA on top of the table! we Chelsea need EPL this season, so no one can stop Chelsea to win the league even if  we plays only  9 players on the pitch like we did against Liverpool but we still we will win it this season. Attack wins you a match, Defender wins you a titles, so liverpool have good attack but we Chelsea have solid diffence so the answer is .........
Salah 👍👍👍👍👍
Praying for Naby Keita’s speedy recovery 🙏🏿
watching this here since I'm sure Man Utd channel won't upload the highlights. MU fans btw.
Salah 🔥
Mo. Salah❤️🇪🇬👑🙏🔥
Mohamed Salah broke Ronaldo's nose, broke his ego, and threatened Messi's throne
ive said it before. Salah has become a better team player than before. Instead of trying to shoot everytim he actually looks for his teamates. Thats why i think salah is at his best. As an attacker i understand that you have to try sometimes but he used so many chances the last two seasons so now that he can pass to teammates and shoot, we can only love him even more than before
I am A Pakistani Liverpool Supporter. Today was Such a Good day. We defeated india in cricket worldcup and humiliated man u in their home. Ooo what a Beautiful day it was. YNWA!!
Mo
wow 0-5
Liverpool training in new tranford stadium
There was an add before the game for like bet356 or something like that and it came up with 2-1 United. Tides turned ay
I guess Ronaldo still cant find a team at his level... 😂
No the best  bLuer in the world
Mo Salah <3
😍😍😍
i thank you all
مبروك للفربول ومحمد صلاح فخر العرب والمسلمين
Ronaldo again proved that he is dirty player. With this self centered attitude, and putting himself higher than club he will never be a top player.
YNWA 🔥
Mo salah 🔥🔥🔥
Manchester United Fans cannot recover from this, hold them tight tonight
Salah proved how great he is and Ronaldo proved how jealous he is!!!!
absolutely sensational
This is the fastest I've ever seen the highlights released😂😂
Now this is the best thing this week 5 - 0 at Old Trafford is amazing
I dont see anyone better than Salah at the moment
MU performance: 0/10 Liverpool performance: 10/10 Ronaldo should have been red carded for kicking Jones.
هذا الموسم لـ يفربول افضل فريق في العالم
m.salah..good job
Bahahahaha... MU fans still believe that comeback on atalanta was a huge things... And now they're understand Liverpool are much more different..😂 😂 😂
Mohammed salah is unbelievable 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 he was amazing 👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊
ole in..
united has become an absolute joke lmao
@Liverpool please give Salah his new contract. He deserves it
Can we just appreciate we played keep-ball for the last 30 minutes at Old Trafford and still won 5-0? 😂
Give salah the ballon dor 👑👑
Brillance brillance brillance from Mo Salah, what a player 🤯.
why is Hendo not getting any love? the guy is the literally liverpool's heartbeat. and what a TOUCH. splendid. it looked like liverpool were playing norwich again lol
Meanwhile PENALDO is still waiting for a TAPIN GOAL CHANCE.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.... MO SALAH SCORE MORE GOALS THAN PENALDO at OLD TRAFFORD in 2021.
Ronaldo Angry wkwkkw
Mo Salah is the best player in the world without any competitor
Liverpool just like playing with Norwich City …… easy win .
هل يعرف الإنجليز كيف يشجع المصريين فريق ليفربول بعد انضمام محمد صلاح له !؟
I swear Man United had a gk on the game but it dissappeard  Still, mad props to Liverpool
Liverpool arrasou!
Man i was thinking Liverpool gonna score 8 goals
Shame on this team and shame on Christiano Ronaldo for this matter
OLE OUT !!!!
Guul taariikhiya ayaan ka gaadhnay waliba gurigooda ayaan ku karbaashnay si xun gacantaa nagu daashay Aar mo salah is the best player in the world
3 mistakes from Luke Shaw, Mactominay was absolute shocker. I am not United supporter! I would have changed Scott and Luke after 15 minutes.
Naby,, get well soon
That Salah pass🙏
Liverpool has no lost this season in the Premier League and i think we can clearly dreaming for the suprem title in england  at the last of the season.
Ole at the Weele 😂😂
Mo salah the best player in the world 🌍🔥👑💕
mo salah 😍
Salah wow...fantastic
Mo Salah now is the highest goalscoring African footballer in the epl history. Now Imagine if he extends his contract with Liverpool for at least 4 more years and keeping this rate, the next highest goalscoring African will have a job to do to surpass that.
Konate
ya ampun
Today all liverpool players were outstanding no exception keita..ta ..hendo.firmino robo..konate  ..jota ..salah van ..aly  Allllll were perfect
Light work
Liverpool was just too hot to handle
United have been raped😂😂😂
Anthony Taylor the Manchester born and bred referee is culpable for keita’s injury  He didn’t send off Ronaldo then again failed to send off Fernandes so Pogba does likewise again Taylor only gives a yellow!? VAR made him change it to RED  Why is a mancunian refereeing this fixture ⁉️
❤🇪🇬❤ MOHAMED SALAH ❤🇪🇬❤ ⭐ 12 Games ⭐ 15 Goals ⭐ 5  Assists ✅ The Best in The World 👏❤🥰
Mohammed Salah ❤️.
There is happiness when united humiliated
Bro no one mentioned how fast salah was last goal
Congratulations 🎉👏 MO Salah the 🇪🇬👑 Legend of Liverpool ever 💯🌠, unstoppable winning best records 💪 and soon congrats him for The ballon d'or prize 🏆 and the Premium League 🏆, next the Euro champion 🏆 and later the world cup 🏆🤞
La defensa del Manchester united  🥅⚽🤸🥅⚽🤸🥅⚽🤸🥅⚽🤸 🥅⚽ 🤸
ppppfffttt🤭
Ole in .
I think fermino was the best player today even though he wasn't score any goal but he is the cause of every goal
🇪🇬 محمد صلاح ربي يحفظك ويرعاك وانت وأسرتك ❤️🇪🇬 ❤️ Egyptian King
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA........
best player in the world right now. The egybtion king👑
Salah really should be proud of himself. At this point, he's got the whole of Egypt to become LFC fans! YNWA
Alhamdulillah. We get the win. Incredible all Liverpool lads
MO SALAH the 1-Season-Wonder goes on for the 5th season in a row 👍👊💪
Mohamed Salahhhhhh🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️🇪🇬
mo salah the best player 🌏👑
MAN UTA WON IN THE C CUP
Good result but why were united so bad??? I feel sorry for them
Thank you liverpool for thrashing man utd in the first half but holding back in the second half so that ole still has a chance of keeping his job
If Salah ain’t 91 rated on fifa 23
صلاح🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow😍
😃😄😃what a disaster for man United 👨
🔥🔥🔥
I wanna see the Liverpool Bayern UCL final this year!
What a bad tackle.. damn.. 2 footed lunge?
Man of the match with questioning is keita for sure
Salah is From another Planet 🥰🇪🇬👑
Henderson assist 👌
Mohamed salah is the best player in the world 🌎🙌👏👌🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬
Man united were mad lmao they were clearly trying to voice their frustrations by injuring players
Hendo assist looks like SteveG vs Fulham in 2014
I m the best in the world
What a game. What a performance.  How Manchester United players are going to fall asleep tonight? It wouldn't help even if they took all the anaesthetic drugs in the world.
That ball from Hendo was absolutely filthy and should be rated for mature audiences only.
YESSSS REDSSSS
Bloody hell. No words to describe Mo Salah. Absolute genius. The great thing about the Liverpool team is the harmony between the players. One of the reasons why Man united failed is because of the selfishness of Ronaldo. I don't expect him to stay with Man united for long lol
Oh my goodnes, i can't imagine that MU was destroyed

Mo Salah the Egyptian king , Long live Liverpool
Mohamed Salah is the best football player in the world right now 👌
موووووووو صلاح
I was watching Salah’s shot for his second goal and I was like “what is he doing.” 2 seconds later I was celebrating mad
cooool‼️
It was Pogba who saved United from a devastating defeat today 😅🤣😂
Good day for Liverpool  five 5 . Liverpool are unbeaten. Mo.salah you are happy for us
Mashaa Allah Mo Salah
And fifa give him 89 lol
As soon as Keita catches form 🤬🤬🤬 Now he’s prob gonna be out for the rest of the season 😢
Mo Salah    The Best in the world
With this consistent performance I can say Mo Salah is the best player in the world right now.
Every time i see this man there is abig smail draw on my face ❤️thank you mohammed salah❤️
Team work must important than individual skill's
To be honest, if you ask me who would you pick currently Messi or Salah? I will instantly pick Salah.... He is just currently better than Benzema,Mbappe,Messi,Ronaldo all combined. He shows up every single game either with deadly assist or goals..
Every time i see this man there is abig smail draw on my face ❤️thank you mohammed salah❤️
Beautiful, elegant, dominant. Absolute masterclass today lads. And it could be even more because after Pogba red card the team was just chilling passing the ball around. And what to say about Salah. Simply the best in the world rn. And some people said he was a "one season wonder".
The Winter Is Coming 🏆⚽ You Never Walk Alone

But that ...... does put a smile on my face.
Puoi oh Puoi I love this club with all my heart ♥ 😭 YNWA 🙌🏿
Ronaldo nazario and Mo Salah are the only players who scored the hat trick at old Trafford against Manchester United!! What a legend Mo Salah has become. Scoring a hat trick at the theater of dreams proves he is The absolute Egyptian King. 💚💚👑🇪🇬
Perfect !!!
A class act
God is good all days 0:5😂😂😂
YNWA 🇮🇩
This is the most dangerous Liverpool I've ever seen in a long time
Could of been worse for man United today, we could of had the McDonald’s kit on. What a performance and what a stage to show off the best player in the world
Admin is early posting about the score line
The new kit was cool on the boys. 👌
That. Was. GLORIOUS!!!  Coming from Liverpool for me the rivalry always feels that bit sharper & like many others I had to suffer through the Ferguson years.  But today was fantastic - to hear Gary Neville say that we were only performing at 75-80% and it wasn’t even the strongest team we have but that we still tore Utd apart…..I will sleep happy tonight!  The only downside were our 2 injuries, Pogba’s foul on Naby was a disgrace.
What a performance! Drink some booze tonight, celebrate and onto the next!
Man Utd are completely trash
salaaaaaaah ooh dear but klopp should play minamino
A penny for Ollie's thoughts
The Egyptian king 🤴 is here
I loved the compassion and respect of today's Liverpool team what a really great team 🇪🇬
I just hope they won't fire Ole after this match, he is doing great job at manu.. from our perspective.
Aeam form aerk livrbol
I will say that. Salah right now reminds me messi at his prime when he scored 91 goals in 2012. Momo right now is out of this world
Nady lad the boss today man got me calm down again after a bad day at atletico Madrid…am always okay when I see him in the side prefer fab more but okay when nady lad play
اعطوة الكرة الذهبية وكفاكم عنصرية ضد العرب والمسلمين
This will never get old doing the years come by.
I think they don't want to humiliated united that much,after pogba sent of they can score at least 3goal and salah is in beast mode💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Sheeesshhh
Superb👍👍👍😎😎😂😂
I was really impressed with Ibou today. He was thrown straight into the deep end and did not look out of place, dominated in the air, made loads of tackles and was really composed💪🧱
Mo Salah
Salah the first away player to score a hat-trick at Old Trafford since R9 in 2003, absolutely incredible! 🤯
مو صلاح
صلاح افضل لاعب بالعالم
sensational
I'm biggest Mo Salah fan but I'd say naby lad was the key player in this match because after he got subbed we didn't scored anymore goals. 🙏
محمد صلاح أفضل لاعب في العالم حاليا، إنه رائع
Ole in🤲🏼
YNWA❤
Mo.salah
ManUs defence though... aaaaahahahahahahaha
He is smashing records for fun 😂
Congrats! Salah The Egyptian King
Mo salah egyption king👍💪
Respect for steping on a break for the last half an hour, if we beat them 8-0 its the end for Ole
YNWA ❤️

One word to describe this Unstoppable
Mo Salah and Naby.. 🔥 The new lethal combination of Liverpool! Hope he won't be out for too long now
This one should’ve been at least 25 min longer, Mr. Admin, I’ll pay for the license.😅😅
Mo salah...mo salah....mo..salah....best palyer in the world
MO SALAH MO SALAH MO SALAH
Mohamed Salah does what no one else can do. He guards three goals in 12 minutes in the Manchester United camp. He deserves to be the best player in the world.
Salah the best in the world 🤟👍
Mo salah💃🇪🇬❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mo Salah, first opposition player in the history of the PL to score a hat trick against united at old trafford. Incredible.
If the Utd players concerned themselves less with Tik Toc, Instagram,  childish dance moves and hair cuts and more with actually giving a siht about football ⚽️ they just might improve.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Naby Keita second best player of the match. Get well Soon Naby😞
Jordan Henderson was absolutely brilliant all match today - He worked really hard in the midfield and played a beautiful pass to Salah for goal number 5!
Actual score is 06-05 6 yellows cards and 5 goals for liverpool Winner is man ult
Macguire is slow af. You can't call that a "defense".
Keita this season playing a lot better than in RB Lipzeig
🇪🇬🇪🇬👑☀️🔥🔥🔥
Donde esta el mejor jugador de todos los tiempos 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Salah was perfect ❤️I hope he stays at liverpool and finish his career with them ❤️ YNWA❤️

The best in the world Mohamed Salah ❤️🇪🇬⭐🥇👑
Salah is a Liverpool Legend
Let's make it 1 million views guys
Keita played wonderfully and shut the doubters up, and Firmino's link up was a positive as well. I'm pleased Jota got in on the action and made a meaningful contribution. Salah is absolutely monstrous and brilliant this season. Salah has to be player of the month for October. Ibrahima Konate's defensive was sound, astute and dominant too. Great competition amongst the CBs.  Henderson played great at 6, he managed the tempo well for the Reds and that assist for 5 was lovely.
Konate pocketed Ronaldo🔥
Liverpool are playing football from a totally different planet the attcking football we all love to watch
Salah...
Mo Salah, the best player in the world
Is hat trick 😎🖒
It's crazy what Salah does, the Egyptian king is back🇪🇬❤️👑
Keita brilliant today get well soon .. and Mo again brilliant performance walk on 🔴🔴🔴
Absolute magical performance from the boys today!  Salah continues to show that he is THE best player in the world at the moment!  Give him a new contract now! Do not take a risk to lose him, PLEASE!
Salah is so damn good. Hopefully he keeps his form and wins the Ballon D'or next year
Egyptian pharaoh Mohamed Salah is the best in the world👑🇪🇬❤️

Egypt’s Mo Salah becomes the all-time leading African goalscorer in the premier league, and the first player in premier league history to score a hat-trick against Manchester Utd at Old Trafford !! He absolutely killed CR7’s bright star this match ❤️‍🔥
Salah is the king of world players
I genuinely expected that we could scored 7-0.
