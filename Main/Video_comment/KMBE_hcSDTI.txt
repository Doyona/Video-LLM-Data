You are beautiful and pure, and immaculate

Splendid
such an underrated artist...
Why isnt this on Apple Music videos?
despite her new releases, this will always be my favourite mv and song of her. so nostalgic! ps: leaving this comment tonight, aug. 28, 2025 🧡🤍🧡
Best thing she ever released.
This is the best b-side track of her debut album Heaven & Hell.
Maybe her most private Song
Girl
Por fin, al fin salí de la obscuridad  De esa oscura habitación  Aquí estoy salí con la luz de energía a bailar después de ensayar en mi las veces encerrado antes recordaba que bailaba para una pista ahora baila para mí mismo puedo hacerlo sin importar que estoy bien
🧡

❤❤❤ LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS AND SONGS!!!💯🎇💞😻😻
I love this song so much!!!!!❤ SO FIRE!!!
This kind of music that takes the name of God in vain is hell's attempt to confuse us, be careful brothers
I wanted to say to both the singer and everyone watching, my brothers, be careful not to take God's name in vain, she didn't need to have quoted the phrase "take the name of the good Lord in vain"
Eu queria falar tanto para cantora quanto para todos que estiverem vendo, meus irmãos cuidado para não tomar o nome de Deus em vão, ela não precisava ter citado a frase "tome o nome do bom Deus em vão" é desnecessário e é uma blasfêmia cuidado irmãos para não pecarem esse é o tipo de coisa que o inferno usa para nos confundir
One of my top favorite songs, it will never be off of my playlists.
It's an anthem, which doesn't appear in YouTube searches, but which makes you reflect in an interesting and artistic way. It's clearly a masterpiece or art that you have to go and see. This is #Naked
Her Wikipedia page mentions nothing about the song I found her from. Cold as ice. Damn shame. People who don’t like that song also don’t respect the Dewey decimal system.
2020 - Naked 2025 - Wet Hot American Dream  :))))
Good song, good clip, beautiful lady

Even in 2025 this song is still a banger ❤
Why can't these females in this day and age use their wonderful talent to sell songs and make money instead of being like naked in her for in their underwear
My work day starts with your song "Kings and Queens" you have a great voice!

Her songs are incredible
Уже 5й год один из любимых песен
3765 anyone?
2025 anyone?
Beautiful Woman 😉😉😘😘
Me because I literally if I’m bored I sit down and listen to all of her songs and there’s this one song I like that I’m listening to like right now. I play over and over and over again until I get bored of it and turns out I never really get bored of it, but I don’t really post any videos of her or anything. I’m not obsessed.
I kno 38 year old guys definitely aren't her demo but I really enjoy her music. Whether it's just a poppy tune that's just supposed to be fun or if it's a deeper, more meaningful one. I think she's really talented and has a great voice. 🎄Merry Christmas 🎄 to everyone out there!
Amazing
Madison Love. It helped Ava a lot with the visualization issue. Ava should have used it for more and more. And then she discards it there.Me lembro quando eu era viciado  Nessa música e nesse clipe em 2021 Os vizinhos não ao aguentam mais haha. Bons tempos, essa canção marcou meu 2021.Why did they remove the time markers?

This song was still 1 year old when I first  listened to it, but now it's 4 years old already. Time flies so fast, whew!
Naked   Deserved to have 50 million
Indian server here 🙌.
she is my fifth element
노래가 너무 좋아서 몇 번이고 다시 듣고 싶을 정도에요
This song hipnotize me 😍😍😍
I love that the costumes are a  play on the fifth element - my favourite movie
The song isn't just talking about being naked. It's also about being emotionally bare. That's why she says you'll never see her naked when she has no clothes. Until she peels back the clothes covering her heart. You'll never see her fully bare. Which is why you'll never break her heart if you don't know it,  like she says in the song. Because only someone who knows her will see her truly naked. All of her.
masterpiece da diva
I may be mad as a hatter but I think mercury ava is super cute.
I LOVE HOW YUOU MOVE YOUR BODFY IN THIS VIDEO. SO SEXY. AND THE SUPER,AM SYMNOL AQND THE SPARKLE. DID YOU MAKE THIS VIDEO FOR ME? ITS SO GOOD!

Release date : September 18, 2020 😮 Buy first 🎧 listening in the beginning of 2021 when the economy is slowly recovering ❤️‍🩹 back to normal 🙏🏻😊😅 this song however, makes me think of the TVC of Hanford Men’s Undergarments
AVA ARE  YOU REAL OR AN A.I. AVATAR. ALL YOUR SONGS ARE RELATIVE TO WHAT I HAVE GOING ON. IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN WITH YOU NOW. I LOVE YOU AND YOUR MUSIC. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT THERE ISANY POIINT TO WRITING ANYTHING HERE BECAUSE DO YOU  READ  IT?  PROBABILY BUSY DOING ANOTHER AWESOME SONG OR WITH SOME LUCKY PERSON WHO YOUR HANGING WITH.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF YOU TILL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND I LOVE ALL YOUR STUFF SO FAR
super man likes your symbol you are dancing in inside of. The diamond with an S in the middle of it. I don't see Satan inside the diamond i see Sexy wearing a Sia Chandelier costume with barcodes on it.  Ava I can imagine what you look like naked because i got rid of the global pandemic which is 666 but so is a bar code. Two lines together represents a six and every bar code has those two lines in the begging middle and end. If you don't like Ava then don't use my code. I want her free of that glass trap because i see her for her truth and not her scars but i would love to worship the son of God inside you if you want to come to Olympia Washington USA and conquer me. I saw you make crapes.  Crapes taste good with lemon and sugar but not lemon and pepper or do they Ava? You went to the UK  this is the land of the free now free my Sexy million dolllar baby from that krypton cage I am torn too thanks to singers like you and Taylor Momsen another wonderful singer who is pretty and it is me who is reckless. You guys should come get me together.
My 2021, this is part

✌️ Lyrics ✌️ Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed (yeah)  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you (yeah)  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

Ava have raison ! Women's IS not product of consommation !! I am not ok for the Plastic life too !  Womens and Mens gentleness and to feel good and protect, The man needs to reassure himself, to tell himself that he has the right to tenderness from the woman... The instincts, we do not want to fight, it is a completely natural need for both, and it's not a question of sex, but of pure Love!! you don't have to waste everything with Sex, you have to have the feeling for it!! We are all equal in the face of this feeling, fighting is useless, why resist? Let's love each other as much as possible, hug each other, hold each other, kiss each other 🤗 Womens/Mens: 50/50!! #2024
Sexy.❤❤❤❤❤
Ava perfectly
Все, что ты делаешь, Как ты это делаешь, Зачем?  Мы и так тебя все Любим! Ты есть --мечта и Любовь!
Love your awesome. Such a dear sweetheart. Love even the orange. mmmm. such a sweetheart.

Ava Max, come to Brazil. We loves u
If You’re OG fan like me then you would also know her as Amanda kay because she first started making music in 2008, but didn’t get any attention, she switched her name to Ava max and that’s what you guys only know her as is Ava max.
Elle l'est belle avec les cheveux orange 💔❤️💞💓❣️❣️💓💔❤️💞

"Promise that you see me for my truth and not my scars" - Ava Max 💖💖
God has a higher dimension form that a third dimension person can't see with the pupil dilated to normal size and God must activate your fucking brain and eyes if he wants you to see him but he's on lockdown
Дівчата! Glory to Ukraine

Lyrics:  Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed (yeah) Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you (yeah) Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

I'll never be bored listening to this masterpiece ❤❤
Enrole-me em folhas de designer e trace ao longo deste quadro Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame  Pergunte-me por que eles costumavam dizer que o problema era o meu nome Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name  Eu tenho bancado o tolo desde que entrei no jogo I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game  Diga-me que eu sou como o céu, tome o nome do bom Deus em vão Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain Mas quando eu jogo minhas cartas, mantenha-as perto do meu peito But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest  Nunca se apaixone, todo mundo perde a aposta Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet  Mas por baixo, eu só preciso esquecer But underneath, I just need to forget  Então venha e me tire a roupa So come and get me undressed Bem, você pode tirar todas as minhas roupas Well, you can take off all my clothes  E nunca me veja nua And never see me naked  Me veja de verdade See me for real  Se você não conhece meu coração If you don't know my heart  Você nunca vai quebrá-lo You're never gonna break it  Bebê Baby  Diga-me se é seguro desnudar minha alma Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul  Eu quero te mostrar meus segredos mais profundos I wanna show you my deepest secrets  Acho que estou pronto para ser exposto I think I'm ready to be exposed  Eu quero você me observando I want you watching me  Quando você tira todas as minhas roupas When you take off all my clothes  E realmente me ver nua And really see me naked  Me veja de verdade See me for real Se eu deixar você deixar a luz acesa e eu baixar a guarda If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard  Prometa que você vai me ver pela minha verdade e não pelas minhas cicatrizes Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars Mas quando eu jogo minhas cartas, mantenha-as perto do meu peito But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest  Nunca se apaixone, todo mundo perde a aposta Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet  Mas por baixo, eu só preciso esquecer But underneath, I just need to forget  Então venha e me tire a roupa (sim) So come and get me undressed (yeah) Bem, você pode tirar todas as minhas roupas Well, you can take off all my clothes  E nunca me veja nua And never see me naked  Me veja de verdade See me for real  Se você não conhece meu coração If you don't know my heart  Você nunca vai quebrá-lo You're never gonna break it  Bebê Baby  Diga-me se é seguro desnudar minha alma Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul  Eu quero te mostrar meus segredos mais profundos I wanna show you my deepest secrets  Acho que estou pronto para ser exposto I think I'm ready to be exposed  Eu quero você me observando I want you watching me  Quando você tira todas as minhas roupas When you take off all my clothes  E realmente me ver nua And really see me naked  Me veja de verdade See me for real Se eu mantiver distância, não consigo me conectar com você If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you  Deitar minha cabeça em seu peito e apenas me render Lay my head on your chest and just surrender  Apenas se renda a você (sim) Just surrender to you (yeah) Bem, você pode tirar todas as minhas roupas Well, you can take off all my clothes  E nunca me veja nua And never see me naked  Se você não conhece meu coração If you don't know my heart  Você nunca vai quebrá-lo, sim You're never gonna break it, yeah  (Oh, você) Diga-me se é seguro desnudar minha alma (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul  Eu quero te mostrar meus segredos mais profundos I wanna show you my deepest secrets  Acho que estou pronto para ser exposto I think I'm ready to be exposed  Eu quero você me observando I want you watching me  Quando você tira todas as minhas roupas When you take off all my clothes  E realmente me ver nua And really see me naked  Me veja de verdade See me for real

Legends that listening in 2023  👇
2 years still my fav song 💓
"Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul", I swear I thought the next line was gonna go somewhere else. "I wanna show you my deepest..."
If that's the name of the song,  then why isn't she naked? 😐
Bro I’m 27 and Ava is my idol fr this one song makes her so sound so beautiful and gorgeous she makes anyone fall in love with her seriouly Ava keep up the great songs my love 😍
Leeloo Dallas, multipass?  I can see some visual influence from Milla Jovovich in The Fifth Element.
❤️😃♥️😀
Radio in America needs to start playing real music like this, and artists that deserve it, stop replaying the same boring tiktok songs on the radio they suck
Glee Song? Blane
I love your songs Ava
Классно Мне Нравится
This song is so underrated, like so many of hers 💛

Leeloo
Majestic

One of his best songs..una de sus mejores canciones, poco valorada...Ava es 100% pop , ese q ya no existe
WHO'S DANCING TONIGHT!!!?? AVA to the MAXXXXXX!!!!
🧡❤‍🔥🖖🍀
You're the best
Eres la mejor
Cant believe her songs are not getting more attention and views.

Leeloo from The Fifth Element 💚
Amazing {♡}
see me for what i am
This is masterpiece
not only because of the name of the song, it deserved to appear quickly in searches when we searched for "Ava Max" Naked"
And the 14 million for the masterpiece arrived, I'm 14 years old good reference I love you AVA
Best music video 👍
народ  этоже класс
NO WOMAN NO CRY . HOW POOR😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Quiero quiero quieroooooooooo
….SINO SI HELIUNG?
my favorite song 🥰
Sexayer than fifth element weapon, ……weapon…….
...липсата на прекален грим ...също е голота...и пределна искреност...поклон...
...the absence of excessive make-up ...also the nudity...and utmost sincerity...bowing...
Te amo Avaaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷👑
I think that she's a Beautiful Woman & I  LOVE this song.
I love Ava Max!  She's the new IT girl next to Dua Lippa, Kim Petras <3.   Lady Gaga will always be queen, and Taylor Swift will always be royalties.
One of the most underrated songs
Oh Ava Max love all your songs. Please produce more. Listening from the Fiji islands. My daughter and I, can't stop singing your songs. I just love them all.
still my favorite song by her
merece mucho más 😭❤️
13M???? Ava Max merece muchísimo más, Naked es un temazo diosss
...skip to ed...
...just with ideas...
...красотата е и на много други места...Да харесвам голото женско тяло...но то е описвано...къде ли не...красиво е...но е създадено и за беля...някой палавник...без мозък...
...beauty is in many other places...Yes, I like the naked female body...but it is described...where not...it is beautiful...but it is also created for trouble...some naughty ...brainless...
...а за голотата...тя радва само тези, които имат очи за нея...
...and about nudity...it pleases only those who have eyes for it...
... не мога да смогна на YouTube...или пък клиповете са кратки...не знам...
... I can't find it on YouTube... or the clips are short... I don't know...
💖
See me fr  I literally love this part
...Не желая да излизам ... много ...от стила в YouTube... или похвала или ...но  ми е приятно да съм с теб ...отдалеч...
...I don't want to go out ... much ...from the YouTube style ... or praise or ...but I enjoy being with you ...from afar ...
❤❤
Mulheres com conteúdo beleza e vaidade como Ava Max me fascinam.
Lembra o filme 5 elemento
❤
I THINK YOU AND I SHOULD GO HAVE A CHEESEBURGER AND A COUPLE OF DR.PEPPERS.  WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS BETTER LOOKING IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. YOU DEFINITELY HAVE THE MALE VOTES.  FEMALES FOR ME. HOW SHALL WE BREAK THE TIE YOUNG LADY?  BEST 2 OUT OF 3 MINI PUTT.  HOW ABOUT THE ONE IN TIRANA.   LOL    YOUR FRIEND JAMES  WHO YES IS A BOY SO THAT MAKES ME YOUR BOYFRIEND.  LOL.
Songs well. Video sucks.
5th element vibes! ❤‍🔥
13M
My God, what a song. You are amazing Ava, I love you. ❤greetings from Ecuador 🇪🇨
...Красива си...дано го чуваш ...по веднъж на ден...
...You are beautiful...I hope you hear it...once a day...
Reminds me her outfit and etc of fifth element
I MUST SAY YOUNG LADY THAT VIDEO WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE.  THE BEST 3 MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS I EVER HAD.  YOU MAKE YOUR POINT QUITE CLEAR.  I WOULD TAKE YOU UP ON THE OFFER BUT COVID 19 RESEARCH ANGEL WINGS TAKES ALOT OF TIME.  I KNOW YOU ARE A STRONG WOMAN BUT OH BOY, YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY DYNAMITE.  KEEP YOUR HEAD UP AND I WILL COMMENT AGAIN VERY SOON.  YOUR FRIEND ANGEL EYES.

I love this song so much 😊
😻😻😻
#AvaMax Together we could stack the deck. 🙏🙏 No need to keep your distance as #IAM the forever. I hear your heart in my ears. The same ears connected to my heart. Your heart makes my heart dance 🤵‍♂💃. Your scars show me the durability of your soul. I see someone I'd like to cover my 6 through the thick of it or the thin. With your best or my worse hand in hand if you dare. This is one wager you can bank on. But I understand you're sharp, you're clever, you're creative, you're wise. Here take these and slide them on those hands - white gloves.  Now you can inspect my heart. Girls got to be safe, right? Oh! If thats not enough here take this - I'm sure you want protection. There are 7 silver linings - 6 in the mag and 1 in the chamber <whispers: no one has to know>. Allow me to expose myself ❤❤‍🔥❤❤‍🔥❤❤‍🔥💘- #Nofear The Good Lord has taught me that perfect love casts out fear. You're in control [❤🎯]. Show me how you drive. I'll ride shotgun 🎯💞🎯. 😜 #RideOrDie
Literal Translation of Lyrics of [Ava Max - “Naked”] That Could Be True for Some Cases (2022.10.16 - 6.15 PM) by Nikh Azmy Beghzr (Nick Besher)  Re lyrics from that song “you can take off all [Ava Max’s] clothes & never see [her] naked… you can take off all [Ava Max’s] clothes & really see [her] naked…”:  -= The Ava Max Clothed Mannequin Borrowing System =-  People borrow from Ava Max one of her mannequins with her clothes on it.  They have her picture on the wall.  They first take the clothes off the mannequin, “all [Ava Max’s] clothes, [never seeing [her] naked]…”, they put on the clothes, then they take off Ava Max’s clothes they put on, to return the clothes to the mannequin, to return the clothed mannequin to Ava Max, & when they’re naked they look at the photograph of Ava Max: they “[took] off all [Ava Max’s] clothes & really see [her] naked…” — they took off the clothes owned by Ava Max, they got from Ava Max, then looked at her photograph, really seeing her [photograph]…”: both quoted statements can then be true.

WHY DOES NOBODY REAIZE THAT THE ORANGE HAIR AND THE WHITE, TORN UP SUIT IS A REFRENCE TO THE FIFTH ELEMENT, I LOVE THE REFRENCE SO MUCH IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY!
This song is one of my favorite from her
I  Love you ava Max Kiss bye  bye
Speaking  from brazil  she has beautiful skin
Yes she is gorgeous vocal talent is the best creativity is all there she has everything The only thing I Don't like is the obvious satanic symbology so I encourage her to start her own record company and make real wholesome traditional American music.
Супер хит👑 ありがとうございま⭐🌸 Naked is a wonderful song, deserves more recognition, I even asked them to play on the radio ❤️🇧🇷
That bass line ... I'm hooked!
Why is it in fullscreen (4:3)?!
Ava has beautiful eyes, very alluring

No hate, but what company would stamp a barcode on bras and panties
Where can I find? Even a copy half as good is sufficient #doppleganger?
Can't her handlers make enough money without forcing a product placement? Bizarre...
Olala, tellement de choses à découvrir, un régal, merci 🇫🇷😏
Y Eva always my fav ..🥰💛😍😘😘 If doremon exist i real i would av use his anywhere door n meet Eva 🥰😍😘❤️❤️❤️
such a good song it deserved 100m+ streams in all platforms

So underrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bestie gave multiple iconic looks :)
Lady Gaga daughter
...Venus...can judge...ah...,I ​​have no right to...and I object...
...I like the female body...but there was a time when the male was on the pedestal...and it was remembered...but whether it was liked...is another matter...
...Харесвам женското тяло..., но е имало време, в което мъжкото е било на пиедестала...и е запаметено..., а дали е харесвано...то е друга тема...
...Great... I'm installing a barcode...
... И голичка си си пак красива, но не мога да те припозная...
... And naked, you're still beautiful, but I can't recognize you...
...Tell..., for whom you cross your eyebrow...
...Пиша ..., а не гледам...къде ми е акъла...ще си избода очите...тъпак...
...Голичка и без грим..., но отново с тези очи...и с другите си неща...вече се избиват... а аз си стоя и загивам... безсилен...а още какво бих сторил???...
...Naked and without make-up... but again with those eyes... and with their other things... they are already killing each other... and I stand and die... powerless... and what else would I do did???...
...И голичка... пак си си готина...
...And naked... you're still cool...
essa é uma das minhas musicas favoritas de todos os tempos e eu digo com toda a certeza do mundo que aqui ela foi maior que carreiras!!!!!

She reminded me of the girl from the 5th element.

she has such a unique voice.. once you listen to her songs and you will be addicted❤❤
This girl is on the rise...her songs are really good
U look so beautiful without makeup av AA m max
What's so bad about this? Why does this music video got only 12 m veiws?
I'd love to hear Bonnie's demo!
I'm 54 and i'm so sorry to discover her only in this period. She has a wonderful voice. She is amazing for me (LOVE). She remember me Madonna ( i don't know why hehehe ) . Maybe i'm so old for new talents XDDDD
A legend! ❤️
She makes good music! ❤️
🫶
🔥 Love this song & album! Can’t wait for the new one in October! ❤️
Amazing
She has such a unique voice so when I heard one of her songs I just knew it was her, no one has as much of a beautiful voice as her, like seriously she needs more recognition and so do her songs, and don't forget why she cut her hair like she knows it's ok to be different and have different features to other people so she cut her hair to be different and suits it, I can't imagine her any other way, so if your a hater back off because she will seriously slay you with her killer personality so don't say we didn't warn you
🕷🕸🖤😈
Love You
None of her songs are bad...They are just awesome, Those lyrics and her voice is gonna remain in my heart forever.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

This music video doesn't need a hundred million views to be called a masterpiece, the artist itself who wrote this is already one
This reminds me of The Fifth Element. That's a 90s Sci-fi film starring Bruce Willis. I wonder if that was her inspiration for this video.
Bits sr9lunsrt dyalk
I left your channel I knew your channel I love your videos you’re very fun to watch that and two discard the Malvones the one that you like those red haired one of those here by
She's pretty without make up
Never see me naked ) ) )
My truth and not my scars.
Ask me why they used to say. The trouble was my Name.)
Yes
I can't blame her,her songs is good. I remember when I were 6and listen to her songs but now,I love her songs too much,I listen to them everyday ;) Have good day Ava max! Greeting's from arab!

Red-orange colour is beautiful! ❤️🧡
응원합니다^^
Ava is just trying her best, people don't attack her with horrible words, she's a human being like us, a wonderful, exemplary artist, an artist who came to stay, artists suffer with kind of uncomfortable words it hurts ok, you keep commenting on things, horrible words and the artist sees what he is receiving from him and he thinks about all that, and all the effort he gives of himself, seems to be going down the drain, so he doesn't come out saying anything from an artist without knowing him or knowing who he really is behind makeup and cameras ok.
Anyone thinking this video is from the film 5th element😂🤣
She is so awesome and amazing and stunning..but tell me this doesn’t sound like a Victorious song.
One of her songs was in my school it is folow the queen and the kings on the throne
shes so pretty :(
Love the inspiration I can see fifth element vibes
Divine performance and a gorgeous baby, just fire. I wish Ave success, good luck and further career growth.
I LOVE AVA MAX ❤
Hello guys, I have a cover of Kings & Queens (Ava Max) on my channel and would be so grateful if you checked it out! I'm an aspiring singer and every opinion counts! :)

A lot involved here.  It cost a shit ton of money to make this video.  Illuminati Confirmed Yo🖤
Ok idk why but she gave me Leeloo vibes from the fifth element. Maybe it's her appearance 🙂 either way ava rocks🧡
Someone has seen the 5th Element. The outfits and the scenes are copys of the movie.
Красавица😍😘😙👍👍
I'd like be to naked

But none of the stuff about me loving Jason is a lie because that was just the missing heart talking And I'm eager to enmore to say it's not about subturbo1798ths either or Jason because I woke up and I finally realized what I'm missing I'm missing the me who could have been anything that he wanted to be like playing the gum game or the life game you know.
how come no one is talking about these lyrics? It's about a little more than sex.

Terrible 🤢
If they desire to only see the body, and never what's beneath the surface of such a aura of beauty how can you get to the truth. To see all within ones truth and soul, is to know the mind and the body and that gives empowerment to the one you claim as your true one and only for she or he is heavenly sent.
Leeloo is looking diferent from fifth element.
Лучшая👑💗💗💗💗💗
Yo
greetings from belgium, big fan
She reminds me to Leeloo of The Fifth Element! ❤️

Do other's here feel the video is a little inspired by the movie "the fifth element" based by hair color and style, and some of the outfits?
it's shocking - WHY ONLY 5- no I'm not gonna rant but SHE DESERVES MORE RECOGNITION *insert whistle note*

Her music is good, better than any other girls. The only disappointed I had is her video, makeup and her dress code.
I love your songs but I don't know how to tell you

Was anyone able to scan the barcode?
not bad but not too good either
Ava is the best artist I ever heard in such a long time
❤️❤️
i think this song is wonderful but the mv i didn't liked it actually
I love her aesthetic it’s so original and different !
I can appreciate her channeling the late 90s to early 2000s with a lot of these videos.
Celeb crush
I am so sorry if I Offended anybody. Yes.   And I have Autism. And Special Needs and other things so.
Plus I hope I will always be a good man
Some people maybe don't know who I am and what I do in my life.  I will tell you somethings about my past ok? OK In my life I have seen people banging screaming getting restrained and all sorts of nasty things. But I am still a Nice Good and Strong Man. I hope I will always be nice and kind for the rest of my life until I get old and die. If I Die Old OF COURSE. The Doctors at the Hospital on the 8th October 2021 and 9th October 2021 (Because I was there past Midnight) said that I am Healthy my Heart is was and probably still is? Healthy and everything else in my body seems Healthy so you know what I mean. Last Word or few words next ok. People said i had a panic attack at the hospital. But I am Feeling Calmer than I was at the moment and as time moves on. Bye
I think I might be in love with her. And I may care for her.
Fifth Element cosplay. 😁😁😁
Que música, que mulher incrível ,ganhou meu coração ( ◜‿◝ )♡

4 years later if you're watching this you're a legend
All American musics look the same: asses, boobs, diamond smile and ordinary voice. You listen to music the same you eat burgers: fake food, a lot of light to beautify, to sublime a product, and BOOM more than 10 millions views.
In another life I sure hope

Uma piada minha: Fez e não fez  (Duas fezes sem prisão de ventre) Sabe o que uma fez disse para uma outra, ao vê-la ao lado? Disse: "Bosta, como os anos passam depressa! Estava tão quentinho e confortável enquanto descansando no reto." E a outra acrescentou: "O mundo está uma merda mesmo! Uai! Não estamos na geração dos ais? iPod, iPhone, iPad, "I" tudo? Apostasia generalizada! Então, estamos também na geração do iMundo! Agora em monturo, ganhamos novas curvas. Tenhamos nós esperança que seremos melhor aproveitados, pois vejo luz aqui! Deus, o Criador, sabe o que faz; eu não ficarei aqui de braços cruzados, apenas esperando tudo acontecer! Ah! Cuidado onde pisas, há muito cocô pelas calçadas!"  (Fezes em prisão de ventre) Sabe o que uma fez assentada à frente disse às outras, assentadas até ao final da fila? Disse: "Somos todas iguais! Juntas venceremos! Agarrai-vos nas curvas! Ninguém nos tirará daqui!" E a fez recém-nascida ao final da fila, suscitou dúvidas: "E se chegar medicamento para soltar as bichas? Não aumentarão a pressão, a confusão, o desconforto, os terremotos e os trovões? Não sereis vós liquefeitos, mesmo que em parte? Afinal, quem gosta de ser reprovado em exame de fezes? Aleluia!"

She is not a bad artist
Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who submit to or perform homosexual acts, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.

Lulu Dallas, Multipass. MUL-TI-PASS!
Ava Max is one of the hottest singers out there today! She's not only super talented but so incredibly gorgeous! A perfect female! She has a good songwriting team behind her. This is by far her best song to date! I have been in the music biz for nearly 60 years and have worked with almost everyone famous! Would love to let her perform some of my songs and sing with her or anything! Love! Jay
One of a kind but not alone
Not LeeLoo Dallas, no multipass.

"Naked" Ava Max  [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
Wonderful music video.

I absolutely love this song ava max is amazing ❤❤
Declaração de originalidade?     Ohh! Amadas mulheres, não tenhais vós medo de mim, pois eu nasci de parto natural, na Pro Matre Paulista, maternidade localizada na Rua São Carlos do Pinhal, 139, subdistrito da Bela Vista, São Paulo, Brasil; logo recebi cuidados da Benedita; adicional e retroativamente, eu também sou português; com ascendentes de Portugal. Não vos desejo nenhum mal. Por favor, não boteis olhos gordos sobre mim.   Boa, justa ou má, até aqui te parece tudo igual? Eu te pareço mau ou original?   Pensando em cenáculo e prosperidade, com minha parcela de QI de ostra, graças a Deus, como ostreicultor que trata as ostras com amor, busco formar ou encontrar pérolas, até mesmo, na bacia das almas; mesmo sem pretensão de criar o meu império, prefiro não ter que pagar por estacionamento; sem trapaça, evito usar parquímetro ou estacionômetro. Evitemos o desperdício.   Hoje em dia, me parece que zumbis da penha descalvada andam por aí, por diferentes lugares, até por Parques; em grupos de quatro, e como que passeando em quadriciclos, e como se não fossem gente desvairada; vangloriando-se da impunidade de terem deixado seus fios de cabelo com prostitutas (ou prostitutos), sem serem descobertos pelos seus pares. Esses zumbis foram varados pela pica seca; muitos mostram inveja, medo e ódio de mim; me querem nivelar por baixo, tentando me tratar e me fazer pecador igual a eles. Sem querer ser vaidoso, prezo cada fio de meus cabelos, independente do corte; bem verdade que eu prefiro que me sejam cortados com amor e conforme o meu gosto, que pode mudar; pois somos livres para amar.   O amor existe, mas para que ele possa pintar é necessário amar.   Sinto a proteção de Deus sobre mim! A chama do fogo eterno pegará os maus, os mentirosos e os iníquos. Justiça já!   Fiquemos com Deus!   Honra e glória a Deus! Amém! Aleluia!   Até logo!     Caraguatatuba, 09 de dezembro de 2018. Fábio Luís Amaral dos Anjos (o Fuzilinho, Belinho ou, ainda, Dinho) Cidadão do Reino de Deus Estagiário de Deus.
Prazer em me conhecer?   Cada um tem seu jeito de buscar prazer ao longo do ano.   Uns aventuram-se em cavernas (naturais ou artificiais), outros nos céus, outros nos mares, outros em terras, outros em lamaçais, outros em desertos, outros em árvores, outros em montanhas, outros em abismos, outros em bordéis, outros nem saem de casa; outros querem o fim do mundo.   Gozemos, com amor, da liberdade.   Por que não aproveitarmos nosso presente ano para agradarmos a Deus?    Não percamos o juízo. Não o guardemos apenas para os dias de sábado; mas, sim, o pratiquemos sempre. Robusteçamo-nos uns aos outros em amor; portanto, juntamente com Deus.

José era formoso de porte e de aparência.                 7 Aconteceu, depois destas coisas, que a mulher de seu senhor pôs os olhos em José e lhe disse: Deita-te comigo. 8 Ele, porém, recusou e disse à mulher do seu senhor: Tem-me por mordomo o meu senhor e não sabe do que há em casa, pois tudo o que tem me passou ele às minhas mãos. 9 Ele não é maior do que eu nesta casa e nenhuma coisa me vedou, senão a ti, porque és sua mulher; como, pois, cometeria eu tamanha maldade e pecaria contra Deus? 10 Falando ela a José todos os dias, e não lhe dando ele ouvidos, para se deitar com ela e estar com ela, 11 sucedeu que, certo dia, veio ele a casa, para atender aos negócios; e ninguém dos de casa se achava presente. 12 Então, ela o pegou pelas vestes e lhe disse: Deita-te comigo; ele, porém, deixando as vestes nas mãos dela, saiu, fugindo para fora. 13 Vendo ela que ele fugira para fora, mas havia deixado as vestes nas mãos dela, 14 chamou pelos homens de sua casa e lhes disse: Vede, trouxe-nos meu marido este hebreu para insultar-nos; veio até mim para se deitar comigo; mas eu gritei em alta voz. 15 Ouvindo ele que eu levantava a voz e gritava, deixou as vestes ao meu lado e saiu, fugindo para fora. 16 Conservou ela junto de si as vestes dele, até que seu senhor tornou a casa. 17 Então, lhe falou, segundo as mesmas palavras, e disse: O servo hebreu, que nos trouxeste, veio ter comigo para insultar-me; 18 quando, porém, levantei a voz e gritei, ele, deixando as vestes ao meu lado, fugiu para fora. 19 Tendo o senhor ouvido as palavras de sua mulher, como lhe tinha dito: Desta maneira me fez o teu servo; então, se lhe acendeu a ira. 20 E o senhor de José o tomou e o lançou no cárcere, no lugar onde os presos do rei estavam encarcerados; ali ficou ele na prisão. 21 O SENHOR, porém, era com José†, e lhe foi benigno, e lhe deu mercê perante o carcereiro; 22 o qual confiou às mãos de José todos os presos que estavam no cárcere; e ele fazia tudo quanto se devia fazer ali. 23 E nenhum cuidado tinha o carcereiro de todas as coisas que estavam nas mãos de José, porquanto o SENHOR era com ele, e tudo o que ele fazia o SENHOR prosperava.''  {Fonte: Sociedade Bíblica do Brasil.

Despedindo-me da Cinderela; cOM ErRata  Sou como eunuco do ventre. Graças a Deus!  Provei da magra Cinderela, e me é como pastel de vento; experimentei seus sapatinhos altos de pedra polida de cristal, e sem cadarço, e ficaram muito apertados em meus pés, e muito folgados em minha cabeça justa. Não me agrada.  Não caminho de sapato alto; nem tampouco tenho comigo. Mas aos que costumam incorporar sapato alto em suas vestimentas, conforme a ocasião, alerto que tomem cuidado para não entrarem com a ponta do salto em buraco onde não querem, ou onde não devem, e para que não caiam, e nem deem vexame.   Melhor, antes, que desçam do salto, banhem-se, e esfreguem bem os pés para remover toda crosta de imundície, e tentem avistar, já de longe, uma terrinha santa.  Imagino que na próxima versão da história, se houver, utilizar-se-ão de cristais piezoelétricos para sapatinhos relâmpagos, e para as virgenzinhas, princesinhas e rainhas, sentirem-se as tais. E quem são os príncipes e reis da terra que usam tais apetrechos? E quem, verdadeiramente, lucra com isso perante o SENHOR?  Ohh! Relinde, melindrada, agora? Por onde andas tu Satanás?  Ah! Meu número de sapato? Será que é o mesmo de Zorobabel?  Faço vento tempestuoso sobre o borralho e reacendo o fogo original. Sobem fumaças em direção aos céus.  Faço-me estagiário do Deus vivo; cadete do Deus dos Exércitos e SENHOR dos Exércitos; sigo firme com todos os seus, como que numa abençoada batalha naval; que já tenho aval.  Honda e glória a Deus!

Assobiando aos fiéis cães de guarda     Ohh! Amados fiéis cães de guarda! Nem vossos ossos os diabos respeitam mais?  Ohh! Carcereiro do diabo, por que manténs Onésimo prisioneiro?  Ohh! Demóstenes, qual é o povo que te segue; quem tu persegues?  Ohh! Dormentes e doentes, não escutais vós Deus batendo às vossas portas?  Ohh! Prisioneiros dos mistérios, que não escutais o que eu já disse: Não precisamos conhecer toda a verdade para sermos verdadeiros. Ficareis vós de fora da ceia do Senhor? Por que não desatai vós os braços de Deus que há por aí?  Ohh! Vicente, por acaso, vangloriarás tu, juntamente, com os hipócritas? Esperarás tu apenas pelo fortuito, ou terás tu, sem demoras, atitudes de amor e de casos pensados, refletidos, juntamente, com Deus?  Assim como minha semente de fé (boa-fé) em Deus foi-se para dar lugar à ciência e convicta dependência de Deus vivo, a qual nos dá a independência dos homens; como percebida inspiração e espiração, com raízes profundas, e com ramos e frutos vistosos, também o homem que havia em mim foi-se, ao provar do fruto da árvore da ciência do bem e do mal, no jardim do Éden, um dos lugares dos Anjos de Deus; que habita em mim, como querubim, desde que nasci, em minha cidade natal; pois sinto-me como eunuco do ventre, com vistas tanto para o ocidente quanto para o oriente; não quero nostalgia; graças a Deus.  Usemos a foice, com mão firme no cabo, e usando, sem preguiça e sem pressa, de nossas puras e sinceras capacidades de análises críticas, e partamos para a ceifa e a vindima, pois a seara e as uvas estão no ponto; balançando ao vento. Vamos sem demoras; antes que caiam e que apodreçam no chão.  Vem tu, também, com paixão pelo amor, que é dom de Deus; para que não dependas da compaixão dos diabos mascarados e açucarados; nem dos transviados; e para que tu não percas as músicas e danças, e nem as sobremesas, das festas dos céus.  Eis que chego como cascata. Provai todos da fonte de meus olhos d`água, bem como da minha queda d’água, e refleti vós se eu estou mentindo, ou se, ainda, estou eu a esconder, de alguém, verdadeiros tesouros dos céus sob a terra.  Ohh! Cuidai vós para não ficardes encurralados no abismo, nem na pequena cascata. Não é hoje dia 04/12 (quatro do doze)? E 4 (quatro) dividido por 12 (doze) não é 1/3 (um terço)?  Oremos sem cessar. Fiquemos com Deus! Honra e glória a Deus! Amém! Aleluia!  Até logo!     Caraguatatuba, 04 de dezembro de 2018.

Denunciando um escorpião  Meu sórdido irmão, Alexandre Augusto, quando adolescente, comprou um kit eletrônico, anunciado numa Revista de Eletrônica; kit chamado Scorpion, que, depois de montado, era um transmissor de FM, do tomando de uma pequena caixa de fósforos; e esse meu irmão, então, usava-o (talvez, até hoje) para escutar, em trevas, conversas dos outros, clandestinamente. Sinto que até hoje há um grande abismo entre ele e mim, pois eu tenho e exercito meu juízo, refletindo, juntamente, com Deus.  Fiquemos com Deus!  Até logo!  Caraguatatuba, 03 de dezembro de 2018.

Ya estás entre ellos lo que pareces. Cambia la luz del sol. O a la luz de la luna. Tienes ojos. Que Dios ayude a los espectadores. Todos miran. Incluyendo muecas y mis pecados. Incluso antes de que se saltara la mayor parte del pasaje. Se convierte en un pasillo y todo duro. Vuelve a lo largo, a suavizar, a durar, a durar. Se sentirá decepcionado y no conoces los vinos. Y empapando, te tragas tu chispa, y tu saliva es vino, y quien traga por ti, y por ti. Mereces desperdiciar el tema. Tus mejillas están rojas, un gramo de mis letras poéticas, de la generación de lluvia como lluvia de. Vierte abajo. Yo no empecé. Tus alumnos no terminan, eres demasiado. Woody continúa 🖋️naderI will break into your borders ... And make Yusra s dolls in your blood ... I will melt inside .... I will let my perfume flow in your air ... I will make you see my face in your mirror ... If you stop looking ,,, I will embrace your breath ,,, then leave me in your sleep ... I will make your eyes embrace mine, and if you try to escape from me ,,,, You will not run away from my sect, for it will flow between the folds of your heart. Beware of my love.

There was this girl who I haven't had the pleasure of meeting, she had a birthday around the time of my Grandma Truka, who was the lady who introduced me to love, my grandma birthday was July 3rd,   Happy belated birthday wishes my love  Wherever you are, come back to me after work so I can memorize your heartbeat like a line from a Shakespearean sonnet.
My name is ava to
Love this song Ava

When I first heard this song it sounded familiar, the I searched SPICE by kagamine len. Yup, the chorus has similarity but both are gorgeously unique.
Wow
I like this one song. Ava Max, I like it. You are the most amazing artist I've ever seen. I hope you are making some new songs for heaven and hell album.

Ela é linda,até com pouca make up
I hear Bonnie McKee so hard in this song. Such an amazing song writer
The words in this song are so powerful. She’s so beautiful and the amount how hate she gets makes me so upset, she’s so underrated. She’s one of my few comfort artists
I like 🥰🥰🥰🇨🇴
been listening to Naked since the release of Heaven & Hell but this is actually my first time to watch the music video. Ava's music are enticing even without the MVs
Magnifique, belle femme, j'aime trop ses chansons
Ava a Queen and a Diva.. A real Boss Bitch!!

Moral Lesson: Don't Kiss A Woman in Front Of Ava
This is such an excellent song too. Actually I love all of Ava's songs. Very catchy, very 80's feel to them, but with a touch of today.
AVA MAX 💖💖💖💖
This song actually very good❤️
Linda🌷
The lord knows I was waiting for some Ava ❤
Nagość ? Nagie szczere prawdziwe żywe kosmiczne eksplodujące uczucia ...
If we can see through all the scars and blemishes that life gives us?... just remember it’s what is deep down inside what really matters in life,love,and pretty much anything I’m life?... see into the heart of a person to truly believe what there all about?... in my opinion Thank you for listening to me and have a glorious day Clay Murphy (Esquire)...
fifth element
The fact that this is one of my least favourite Ava Max songs but yet I still love, love, love it kinda speaks volumes on how much love I have for this woman 😍😍

Is this song supposed to be catchy?  It sounds no different than thousands of other modern pop songs.
She's better than miley cyrus
She's a very good singer
Lyrics are so wholesome
She simply continues to amaze with her true talent and awesome voice
Ava Max de lo mejor.. Me alegras la vida 🇪🇸🤗

This song is not what I expected...so much better!
Such a goddess, you're heart mind and body, and soul would never have to ask this question or utter the words. If they can't undress you with their eyes and hearts and souls, then what's the point.
You are dream girl🤩😍🥰😛😋
This is one of my top 3 favorite songs on the album and I’m just now finding out it has a video

OMG ava max
Oh my God
Is it just me or does Ava have a bit of a country twang in her voice? I can totally see this song being covered country-style one day.  The chorus is incredibly catchy. Surprising, I've yet to hear this on radio. It's a solid single.
Everytime i watch this beautiful video reminds me of my beautiful BMW, it's always playing in it and it's beautiful just like you! It's my day off and I'm listening to you all day 💙

Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name  I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real  If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me  When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed (yeah)  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real  If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me  When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you (yeah)  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah  (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me  When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

I really love this song!!! 😍
5 element
The looks with the orange hair remind me so hard of the movie the fifth element. Especially the one with the white leather thing I thinks it's inspired by the main female character of that movie. I love it
It's like bad romance and teenage dream is having a baby
I guess you're the 5th element
Leeloo is that you!?
Nice video ... Is it inspired by the main character of the movie The fifth element?
i dont know why but the short and long hair bother me
Thank you for being part of us all... It's wonderful having wonderful people like you...  BEBÉ!!!!

If you give me your Heart i never gonna break it
This is very very good
I hat hat this song
Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed (Yeah!) Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you (Yeah!) Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
Código de barras; João 20. 19 A (''Or'' a) 31 E Ava Max  Código de barras  ''Código de barras (em inglês: barcode) é uma representação gráfica de dados numéricos ou alfanuméricos. A decodificação (leitura) dos dados é realizada por um tipo de scanner - o leitor de código de barras -, que emite um raio vermelho que percorre todas as barras. Onde a barra for escura, a luz é absorvida; onde a barra for clara (espaços), a luz é refletida novamente para o leitor. Os dados capturados nessa leitura óptica são compreendidos pelo computador, que por sua vez converte-os em letras ou números humano-legíveis. A utilização é muito comum em diversas áreas, desde a indústria é largamente utilizado no comércio e serviços.  Código de Barras para produtos - Os códigos de barras EAN-13 servem como identificação de seu produto no sistema de Ponto de Vendas dos lojistas. Qualquer produto, como por exemplo produtos alimentícios, CDs e DVDs, produtos naturais, verduras e legumes, roupas e vestuários, sapatos, entre outros utilizam códigos de barras EAN-13. As únicas exceções são livros (veja código ISBN) e medicamentos controlados.  Também conhecido como GTIN-13, esse código de barras é usado no mundo todo, exceto EUA e Canadá (veja UPC).

Seu código consistia num padrão de circunferências concéntricas de espessura variável.  Em 1969, a Associação Nacional das cadeias alimentares (NAFC) realizou uma reunião [1] onde se discutiu a ideia de sistemas de verificação geral automatizadas. RCA tinha comprado os direitos à patente de Woodland original, participou da reunião e deu início a um projeto interno para desenvolver um sistema baseado no bullseye código. A cadeia de supermercados Kroger se ofereceu para testá-lo.  Em meados dos anos 1970, o NAFC estabeleceu o Comitê para Supermercados dos Estados Unidos em Código Uniforme de Produto de Supermercado, que estabeleceu diretrizes para o desenvolvimento de códigos de barras e criou uma subcomissão para seleção de símbolo, para ajudar a padronizar a abordagem. Em cooperação com a empresa de consultoria McKinsey & Co., eles desenvolveram um código padronizado de 11 dígitos para identificar produtos. A comissão enviou então uma proposta de contrato para desenvolver um sistema de código de barras para imprimir e ler o código. O pedido foi para Cantor, National Cash Register (NCR), Litton Industries, RCA, Pitney-Bowes, IBM e muitos outros. Foram estudados uma grande variedade de abordagens de código de barras, incluindo códigos lineares, código de círculo concêntrico da RCA (bullseye), padrões de "explosão de estrela" (starburst) e outros.  Na primavera de 1971 RCA demonstraram o seu código bullseye em outra reunião indústria. Os executivos da IBM na reunião notou as multidões no estande da RCA e imediatamente desenvolveu seu próprio sistema. Especialista em marketing IBM Alec Jablonover lembrou que a empresa ainda empregado Woodland, e ele estabeleceu uma nova unidade na Carolina do Norte para liderar o desenvolvimento.  Em julho de 1972 RCA começou um teste de dezoito meses em uma loja de Kroger em Cincinnati. Os códigos de barras foram impressas em pequenos pedaços de papel adesivo, e anexado à mão por funcionários da loja quando eles estavam adicionando etiquetas de preços. O código provou ter um problema sério. Durante a impressão, às vezes prensas manchar de tinta na direcção do papel está em execução, tornando o código ilegível na maioria das orientações. Um código linear, como o que está a ser desenvolvido pela Woodland na IBM, no entanto, foi impresso na direcção das tiras, de modo que tinta adicional torna o código simplesmente "mais alto", permanecendo legível, e em 3 de Abril de 1973, a IBM UPC foi seleccionado pela NAFC como seu padrão. IBM tinha projetado cinco versões da simbologia UPC para necessidades futuras da indústria: UPC A, B, C, D, e E.   NCR instalado um sistema testbed no Supermercado da Marsh em Troy, Ohio , perto da fábrica que estava produzindo o equipamento. Em 26 de junho de 1974, Clyde Dawson puxou um pacote de 10 de Wrigley Juicy Fruit goma fora de sua cesta e foi digitalizada por Sharon Buchanan em 8h01. O pacote de chicletes e da recepção estão agora em exposição no Smithsonian Institution . Foi a primeira aparição comercial da UPC.'' ...  {Fonte: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Código_de_barras}.

A incredulidade de Tomé  Lucas 24.33-43 e refs.   19 Chegada pois a tarde de aquele dia, o primeiro da semana, e cerradas as portas onde os discípulos, com medo dos judeus, se tinham ajuntado, chegou Jesus, e pôs-se no meio, e disse-lhes: Paz seja convosco. 20 E, dizendo isto, mostrou-lhes as suas mãos e o lado. De sorte que os discípulos se alegraram, vendo o Senhor. 21 Disse-lhes pois Jesus outra vez: Paz seja convosco, assim como o Pai me enviou, também eu vos envio a vós. 22 E, havendo dito isto, assoprou sobre eles e disse-lhes: Recebei o Espírito Santo. 23 Àqueles a quem perdoardes os pecados<1> lhe são perdoados: e àqueles a quem os retiverdes lhes são retidos. <1> 20.23 Mt 16.19; 18.18 24 Ora Tomé, um dos doze, chamado Dídimo, não estava com eles quando veio Jesus. 25 Disseram-lhe pois os outros discípulos: Vimos o Senhor. Mas ele disse-lhes: Se eu não vir o sinal dos cravos em suas mãos e não meter o dedo no lugar dos cravos, e não meter a minha mão no seu lado, de maneira nenhuma o crerei. 26 E oito dias depois estavam outra vez o seus discípulos dentro, e com eles Tomé. Chegou Jesus, estando as portas fechadas, e apresentou-se no meio, e disse: Paz seja convosco. 27 Depois disse a Tomé: Põe aqui o teu dedo, e vê as minhas mãos; e chega a tua mão, e mete-a no meu lado; e não sejas incrédulo, mas crente. 28 Tomé respondeu, e disse-lhe: Senhor meu, e Deus meu! 29 Disse-lhe Jesus: Porque me viste, Tomé, creste; bem-aventurados os que não viram e creram. 30 Jesus pois operou também em presença de seus discípulos muitos outros sinais, que não estão escritos neste livro. 31 Estes, porém, foram escritos para que creiais que Jesus é o Cristo, o Filho de Deus, e para que, crendo, tenhais vida em seu nome.''  {Fonte: Sociedade Bíblica do Brasil.

FINALLY a woman that can tell the world that a women needs to see the deep in you instead of just a pair of tits and a vagina. They are more complicated than you may think men, since I've been taking on a single parent roll with 2 girls at ages of 7 months and 2 y 4m it has been the best experience to do this. Makes you appreciate all the single mothers that succeed in life and now the fathers are showing it out now. Not that is says anything about the parent of the past few decades i would say.
She is so beautiful without those makeup.
✝️🐅👑🇦🇱🧜‍♀️🦁⛪🏛🦉🧠🌟🧖‍♂️🏛🇺🇸⚔✝️    I didn't expect    to be commenting so soon.    I guess my emotions took over.    I just wanted to say,    Your music matters,    It's what got me here.👍✌
High I'm brain Witt Eric  you're vibrant and beautiful
"Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars." ❤🥺

Seems like some of the costumes for this video were inspired by 5th Element...

O rei da Assíria leva para Samaria muitos estrangeiros           24   E o rei da Assíria trouxe gente de Babel, e de Cuta, e de Ava, e de Hamate, e Sefarvaim, e a fez habitar nas cidades de Samaria, em lugar dos filhos de Israel: e tomaram a Samaria em herança, e habitaram nas suas cidades.  25   E sucedeu que, no princípio da sua habitação ali, não temeram ao Senhor: e mandou entre eles o Senhor leões, que mataram a alguns deles.  26   Pelo que falaram ao rei da Assíria, dizendo: A gente que transportaste, e fizeste habitar nas cidades de Samaria, não sabe o costume do Deus da terra: pelo que mandou leões entre ela, e eis que a matam, porquanto não sabe o culto do Deus da terra.  27   Então o rei da Assíria mandou dizer: Levai ali um dos sacerdotes que transportastes de lá; e vão-se, e habitem lá: e ele lhes ensine o costume do Deus da terra.  28   Veio pois um dos sacerdotes que transportaram de Samaria, e habitou em Betel, e lhes ensinou como deviam temer ao Senhor.  29   Porém cada nação fez os seus deuses, e os puseram nas casas dos altos que os samaritanos fizeram, cada nação nas suas cidades, nas quais habitavam.  30   E os de Babel fizeram Sucote-Benote: e os de Cuta fizeram Nergal; e os de Hamate fizeram Asima.  31   E os aveus fizeram Niba e Tartaque: e os sefarvitas queimavam seus filhos no fogo a Adrã-Meleque, e a Anã-Meleque, deuses de Sefarvaim.  32   Assim temiam ao Senhor: e dos mais baixos se fizeram sacerdotes dos lugares altos, os quais exerciam o ministério nas casas dos lugares altos.  33   Assim que ao Senhor temiam, e também a seus deuses serviam, segundo o costume das nações dentre as quais tinham sido transportados.  34   Até ao dia de hoje fazem segundo os primeiros costumes; não temem ao Senhor, nem fazem segundo os seus estatutos, e segundo as suas ordenanças e segundo a lei, e segundo o mandamento que o Senhor ordenou aos filhos de Jacó, a quem deu o nome de Israel.<3>  <3> 17.34 Gn 32.28; 35.10 35   Contudo o Senhor tinha feito um concerto com eles, e lhes ordenara, dizendo: Não temereis a outros deuses,<4> nem vos inclinareis diante deles, nem os servireis nem lhes sacrificareis.  <4> 17.35 Êx 20.5; Dt 5.9 36   Mas ao Senhor, que vos fez subir da terra do Egito com grande força e com braço estendido, a este temereis, e a ele vos inclinareis, e a ele sacrificareis.  37   E os estatutos, e as ordenanças, e a lei, e o mandamento, que vos escreveu tereis cuidado de observar todos os dias: e não temereis a outros deuses.  38   E do concerto que fiz convosco vos não esquecereis: e não temereis a outros deuses.  39   Mas ao Senhor vosso Deus temereis, e ele vos livrará das mãos de todos os vossos inimigos.  40   Porém eles não ouviram; antes fizeram segundo o seu primeiro costume.''  {Fonte: Sociedade Bíblica do Brasil.

Ava - when French poet Victor Hugo said “music speaks to us in a way that spoken words cannot” he was referring to musicians like you and a few others that have really harnessed the essence of music and what it means. Thank you for your dedication and confidence, and the confident-sassy approach to your songs like “Naked” and “Torn” to name a few.
Song 80s
You are beautiful and have a beautiful voice.
Look like gaga
This song is so beautiful! I love it

Ava Max music videos that we must support to be certified after passing 100 million views:  - "My Way"  - "Torn"  - "Freaking Me Out"  - "Who's Laughing Now"  - "Naked"  - "OMG What's Happening"  - "My Head & My Heart"   and in others where she was invited:  - "Into Your Arms"  - "Make Up"  - "Slow Dance"  - "On Me"  - "Stop Crying Your Heart Out"    Come on fans, let's support Ava...!
Same same Lady Gaga 😍😍🤩
I feel like this is the next level for Ava, it just sounds so different, so mature

Ma favorite song🤍

Dulce melodía
Okay, just one question. Where is her MULTIPASS???
I see Lady Gaga in every video of her
Unpopular opinion: she looks so freakin' bueatifull without makeup.
I need to buy some of ur outfits
I didn't know this singer until the summer of 2020. That's when I heard Kings & Queens and Sweet but Psycho through twitter and Tik Tok. Neither of these songs did anything for me.  I can admit I am pretentious with pop music, so I kind of stuck my nose up to her. All the music I knew of hers wasn't fresh. Her damn haircut just added fuel to the fire. I never gave her much of a chance. However, I finally did a listen through of Heaven & Hell today and wow. What an album. It is a fun, sugary-plastic coated, nostalgia-packed mix tape of old melodies turned into something new. It has like 12 tracks and maybe 3 of them are average. For a first record, Ava delivered! Some have called her shallow or unoriginal, but this song defies that for me. It is so intimate and personal. I will be streaming!!
Love
🙂🥶👍🏻
Amo e amo...
Omg the parrots!!! Birbs!!! <3
Ava Hair 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ily
she seems to be adorably short
Just finding out about this song the only songs I knew before this was my head my hear, sweet but phsyco, kings and queens and so am I. I’m a big fan of Ava and she’s a great singer can’t wait to hear all the other songs I saw might go to one of her concerts someday 😊✨
😂😂😂😂🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Не такая уж она и naked, в этом клипе. Хотя, фигура представлена достаточно полно. Жалко что песня не очень ритмичная.
COVID made fat so ..... you’ll NEVER SEE ME NAKEEEEDDDDDDD
Ava Max and Billie elish and alen walker are only people I know that don't have any bad words in their songs
I don't understand why this song & video is underrated. :(((
She looks like the fifth element girl lol pretty cool
how does this not even have 10m
7.584.515 ????????????  only?
I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ i will see you 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭 my Queen you so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
I love this girl 🥰
This song needs more attention. Its freaking awesome. 😍
this well be on my play list
Such a beautiful woman underneath all the glitz and glamor, and a stunning voice to go with it. Dont find that talent package too often now days.
She looks like Mila Jovovich on Fifth Element. Nice song and video <3<3
You the Next Topmodel by GNTM LOVE You ♥️♥️
🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Shes not naked 😠😠
Wow esta canción es tan hermosa💓🤧
this just shows how out of touch i am with modern ''pop'' music. never knew there were more tracks past ''sweet but psycho'' and ''alone''. now ive actually listened to them i must admit my favorite is ''torn''. harmonically her voice. wow. dynamically. wow. saw a video of her singing at home and proves she can do it all. i mean in terms of being really talented outside of a studio on basic equipment.
Nude color clothing brings a whole other vibe. I want to see the real you too.

Friends are like a good book, you are willing to take a book home, savor the fun and machinations in the book, there must be your own interpretations; perhaps it is the emotions invoked; brought by a certain sentence, or it reflects you Longing for love, affection, passion and/or compassion. In the end, although not necessarily or a necessity for you have to agree with the author's ideas and arrangements, at least it can help you understand yourself from what you glimpse or gleamed from what the author was articulating. When the ending ballad sounded in the movie, the crowds in the huge theater were gradually dissipating, and one might not understand the complex emotions that were called forth, just like the way they react to life. In any case, a touching and extraordinary movie can bring you and I(US) colorful and exquisite feelings. It doesn't matter whether it is sorrow or amusement. It doesn't matter whether it is heartache or joyful euphoric bliss. What can awaken you can also inspire me. Life is a good movie to be thought-provoking; the temperament of a person's character is also a good book with very different flavors. Every friend is like a good book, even an adult who says one thing or does another in your eyes. In any case, we decided to open the book ourselves. If we are not happy, of course, you can close it at any time. If you are willing, try to calm down and turn back the pages and reread some of the chapters. You may find some missing sections that make you willing to learn more about this person. Many things are not as simple and easy to understand as they are seen. Everyone has his unknown stories behind them. No one is born to hurt anyone but mistakenly thinks that doing so is for their own good. Friends, I am definitely not an expert on the full spectrum of Emotions, behaviors of life and society, I just enjoy trying to understand the complex minds we are blessed with, and to expand my own mental state and understanding of everything around me, myself and I. When you are willing to learn more about others, it will certainly help you to learn more about yourself, because you, like me and everyone else, have a desire for love and a fear of losing love. To all kindred spirits and others alike.
不动明王 - DHarma Protector; remover of obstacles and destroyer of evil.  Do we really understand what it means?
Interesting, my daughter really seems to like your Jam, you reminded me of one of my favorite Film "Fifth Element"  I'm scarred from head to toe... I like the feeling the music invokes and stores up in my mind and heart...
1:18
[LYRIC] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say the trouble was my name I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real   If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to, you  Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it (oh)  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [ESPAÑOL] Envuélveme en sábanas de diseñador y traza a lo largo de este marco Pregúntame por qué solían decir que el problema era mi nombre He estado haciéndome la tonta desde que entré al juego Dime que soy como el cielo, toma el nombre del buen Dios en vano  Pero cuando juego mis cartas, las mantengo cerca de mi pecho Nunca enamorarse, todos pierden la apuesta Pero después de todo, solo necesito olvidar Así que ven y desnúdame  Bueno, puedes tomar toda mi ropa Y nunca verme desnuda Verme de verdad Si no conoces mi corazón Nunca vas a romperlo Bebé  Dime si es seguro desnudar mi alma Quiero mostrarte mis más profundos secretos Creo que estoy lista para ser expuesta Quiero que me mires Cuando me quites toda mi ropa Y realmente me veas desnuda Verme de verdad  Si te dejo dejar encendida la luz y bajo la guardia Prométeme que me verás por mi verdad y no por mis cicatrices  Pero cuando juego mis cartas, las mantengo cerca de mi pecho Nunca enamorarse, todos pierden la apuesta Pero después de todo, solo necesito olvidar Así que ven y desnúdame  Bueno, puedes tomar toda mi ropa Y nunca verme desnuda Verme de verdad Si no conoces mi corazón Nunca vas a romperlo Bebé  Dime si es seguro desnudar mi alma Quiero mostrarte mis más profundos secretos Creo que estoy lista para ser expuesta Quiero que me mires Cuando me quites toda mi ropa Y realmente me veas desnuda Verme de verdad  Si mantengo mi distancia, no puedo conectarme contigo Apoyar mi cabeza en tu pecho y solo rendirme Solo rendirme a, ti  Bueno, puedes tomar toda mi ropa Y nunca verme desnuda Verme de verdad Si no conoces mi corazón Nunca vas a romperlo (oh)  Dime si es seguro desnudar mi alma Quiero mostrarte mis más profundos secretos Creo que estoy lista para ser expuesta Quiero que me mires Cuando me quites toda mi ropa Y realmente me veas desnuda Verme de verdad

She’s Leeloo from “the 5th element” 😍
Her makeup artist:How long do you want the lashes? Ava: YES
Ava Max: if I keep my distance I can’t connect with you  2020: *yes*
This is my favorite of Ava's this far.  Want to see and hear this go to #1, AND some really good remixes!!! ♥♥♥
Anyone else looking at this and remembering that movie the 5th Element?
She is the fucking future !!!
The only one with a good voice in 2020. Everyone else is either stoned mumbling (rap) or sleeping (Billie Eilish).
Esta canción tenia mucho potencial su disquera no le dio nada de promoción como Siempre y siguió explotando Kings and Queens😭😭
❤💥
I love
Omggg
The progression of her career in a few years was all right there in her Heaven and Hell album. She get better each and every day. I love this goddess Ava Max
amo esta canción por cierto muy infravalorada... es mi canción favorita de Ava 💕
❤❤Amanda
Elle n'aime pas qu'on l'a compare à  Lady Gaga mais elle fait tout pour la ressemblait y compris ses clips, et ses costumes. Une chose qu'elle n'arrivera jamais  à copier c'est la voix formidable de Lady Gaga !!!
Воу, пародия на 5 элемент?
I LOVE YOU❤❤❤❤❤😭😭😭
We all know that this is sponsored by Dyson.

the people who disliked this video are DEMONS.
She’s really annoying because of constantly asking for my help at work, asking me to repeat how songs or dances went
The poor doggie had to suffer and watch dis XD.
Every song she releases is a B A N G E R.
I like the songs I made with Ava Max

We all know that all songs of Ava are underrated, but maybe this is the most! ☹️☹️☹️
ผมปิยพงษ์. ผมยากยูกับคุนสง
This is the "Shakira - Whenever, Wherever" - Moment of the next Generation.  Ava Max is way better!
"Take my money" just doesn't do the meaning justice.
A little bit look a like of Kyline Alcantara.
I love u ava❤️❤️❤️
shes that character!!
Shes so mature, her lyrics sing to me and im older than she. its so beautioful this whole album was crafted so genuinely by her i love it. i dance to her music at the clubs too girl kills it!
Everyone else: your better naked Ava max : don’t love someone bc of thare body love them bc of thare heart Ilysm Ava
So proud of you Ava well done I Reiner your first vid ever your songs have changed
Me in 2050: oh Ava you have changed allot I remember so much if onky we could go back to the old days the teck has changed so much from not your Barbie girl to all thease new songs

Maravilhosa , de primeira conseguiu criar uma marca o cabelo e a sua grande extensão vocal S2❤️❤️❤️
Ava Max ok

Nova Lady Gaga? (Isso é um elogio ❤️)
Her songs are so good to hear, I love it
soooo  underrated!
Imagine being that pretty... It's crazy how pretty Ava is
i wish
Never..💋❤
Am i the only one that thinks that she sampled Michael Jackson's Billie Jean at the beginning of the song
Yang milih allah like 40000 ya.
Nobody don't want to see this bag of jangling bones naked ,wannabe Hayley Williams from Paramore
Her 2 piece is so cool
How come now only I'm noticing her? 😂
เธอคือลูกสาวโทรนีใช้ไม่คับผมสง
She looks way prettier with natural makeup
You search on Google: Ava Max Naked Bruh 😳

Hermosas visuales! Los outfits, el pelo y el maquillaje, la escenografía, el minimalismo, los movimientos de la cámara, obviamente ella y la canción hacen de este un muy lindo video. Mi favorito de Ava hasta ahora.

Cool!
Hi beauty ❤️ is it ok to cry when I watch you!!!
0:11 xx
everyone is saying that she deserves better an i agree but you gotta remenber that her debut album"heaven and hell(HAH)" is doing sooooo good on spotify with more than 2.1bil streams!!! so proud of Ava  but she stills deserves better
YESSSSSSS THE ORANGE HAIR IS AMAING ON HER! What a queen👑
To be honest, i prefer blond hair Ava ^^
Correct me if I'm wrong but ava max maybe the single best thing to hit music since queen b she has the sass the sex appeal and her vocals are simply out of the world she reminds me of young Christina Aguilera with her chords and her outfits are like Lady gaga yet she is the only ava max I love this woman so much.
Awesome thanks so much for this sense
Omg.
Beautiful love u.
The dislikes are just jealous that their not as good at singing than Ava
זה naked זה????
Leeloo vibes Big bada boom

Ava Max I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!
hays why you always look so good miss ava! 😍
Damn
I guess nobody still knows who I really am
I like the meaning of this song. It's like she's saying that she wants someone to see her true self. (Both in general and for someone to see her real personality naked or not.)
Iya ya Allah.
😍
Love you.
Que Dios nos perdone.
Ugly,  no need to see you naked.   All her songs sound like other songs I heard all she dose is just add more and chnages the beats.. thats all . Thats sucks
Wtf?

*People shouting STOP IMMIGRATION, GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY, listen to this song and appreciate that had Amanda Ava Koci's parents not immigrated to US from Albania, you'd never get this artist. By the way, i am no one to judge anyone, it was just a thought that ran into my head. Cheers from India.*
Definitely one of my favorite songs by her 💙💙

Does the bar code on her clothes have any meaning? I tried to scan it with an app in 1:25 and 2:55, but I got no result :( EDIT: You should NOT do that in public! Pleople will start looking at your very strange ^^'
I'm here everyday! Love this!!!!

Ava Max you are my favorite artist and when/if covid goes away I will go to a concert for you and I hope I get to meet you sometime in my life because you are shaping my musical abilities more than country ever did. #lifegoals #iloveavamax
This video reminds me to The Fifth Element.
Thanks for this masterpiece, Ava. 💖
What's the deal with her eyebrow? Is it a fashion statement or a scar or something else entirely? Asking because I've seen a very similar gap on another singer - same eyebrow and everything - and thought it was too much of a coincidence for them both to have such a specific thing.
5.4m only this view this video should have more view who agree pless like
Omi’m in a google meet with my friends and they are soooo funny I also love ur music
Princess Merida

Only people who watched the premiere are worthy of liking this 👍

Gracias Ava max por esta canción sin duda me encanta, quizás a miles de personas igual pero en mi particularmente produce algo especial. Entre tantas cosas malas que trajo este 2020 esta es una de las cosas buenas. 😘
Creative, that's what this music is like❤️
She remind of Leeloo from 5 element, with that red hair 😏
Take off all my clothes and now you see me naked...but then there is more behind the frame. She's talking about what's beyond the frame.  Seee her for real...as human, struggling like the rest. How bringing her into gods name is in vain......love is often vain...Beautiful song! Beautiful and truthful expression <3
5th element vibez🧡
Tf how this still 5M !! She deserves better than that 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 at least 10M !!
Naked means truth
Hello Ava max im really greatful to know you and thank you so much for this wonderful song IDK if how many times i hear this song but i really love it thank you so much love you take care always 😊😍😘
Good start photo... But so childish... 😇👍😉

She is making great, memorable music - So much music today is crap but she keeps the flame alive of beautiful + timeless music! XOXO AVA!
Leelu??
Literally impossible for her to make a bad song.

🎯👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
There's no doubt this video will have over 1 billion views in 2 years.
Once the pandemic is sorted - soon, I hope - , and everyone is back on their feet, Ava's publisher needs to make a massive, worldwide marketing push. Ava has quality and talent. I have spoken.
Same sound as poppy moshi moshi
Milla Jovovich wore it better
I LOVE AVA MAX❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗🙃🤣😃🤣😅😀😅😀😅😀😅😂😘😅😀😀🥰
Ava Max is a cheaper copy of Lady Gaga
1980s Retro  uh nah.    2020s Retro OH YEA

Nobody gon talk abt how beutiful she looks in this and the orange hair muvahh❤️❤️🧡🧡
i mean wow this deserve more than a grammy
😍😘😗😙😚❤❤❤❤❤
Is no one gonna bring up how all her videos have beats headphones? Like all she's doing is advertising the brand
Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this pain Ask me what they used to say, that trouble was my name I've playin' a fool, since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed Boy, you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I let you leave the light, I'll never drop my guard Promise that you see me for my truth and not my scars But when I play my cards, I keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed, yeah, yeah Boy, you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest, and just surrender Just surrender to, you Boy, you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it Oh, oh-oh Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

I feel like pressing the thumbs-up-button just doesn't justify my appreciation for the song... Such a masterpiece!

A bad cosplay of Lady Gaga and 5th Element.

Słabe. Inne piosenki lepsze.

This Is Fucking  Amazing
I like her a lot but after watching this...seems like she’s turning Miley Cyrus (wrecking ball) on us. The ‘dance’ choreography seems more suited for a pole dance at a strip club?! 🤷🏽  She doesn’t need to show so much ass to sell her music!

The lyrics are always so fucking excellent. She makes pop worthwile again.
Ok but this song is 2015 doe 🖤😌💅
Ava Max parece o matuê kkkkkkkkk
nooo el quinto elementooo jaja
Blonde or Orange Hair Which suits her better?Like for Blonde comment for orange hair guys
This song gives me MAJOR Bonnie McKee vibes. The video, too, reminds me of Bonnie. It gives me major Easy vibes -  which I love tbh because I was obsessed with that song when it dropped. Lyrically, it feels kind of like the counterpart to Easy, too. Either way -- definitely going to be playing this a lot!  Ava Max has got such an amazing voice and she's so gorgeous. I'm glad I stumbled on her accidentally one night, I love everything she's been releasing since.  EDIT: I looked up the songwriters on this just to see if I was crazy, and I'm not! (For this reason, anyway) Bonnie McKee is indeed one of the writers! Makes so much sense now! lol
WHO WANTS THE ALBUM TO COME OUT IN VINYL ?? :)
Está canción debería estar en el número 1 de billboard, es muy arteeeee.
Ava is such an extraordinary artist and I love her and her music  for that it's unique  ❤️
Did anybody else notice she wears Beats in almost every music video? :)
is it possible that every song is better than the last?
The best
Great song
What's the name of all the ava max' characters in her clips ?
She look like a lot of 2010 lady gaga
unpopular opinion: this deserves more views, period
Great music, great melody, worse lyrics and pornographic video... get the instrumental version and forget about the original.
I got it , they are flying through the decades and who ever they need as a show piece holds the reigns......from what I can tell, it's back to the Future Nostalgia, they call me Marty McFly with me to night Ms. Lipa? Who remembers?  - A Zul in Exile
guys in 1:48 you can see her kitty and peach
bop
she's so beautiful
Gorgeous gorgeous!
Orange hair it's special but nice

Ava Max ft ZAYN...  how would be ??? EPIC

Ava max perfect music
Subtle Beats advertisement, I see you 😂  Yas, get that 💵 ! Love this song tho!  Probably my favorite of Ava.  Her musical style is so uniquely her, super real, raw, and a little quirky. ❤️
1:30 Girl, eyebrows! 👀 Hold your eyebrows! That's just WAY too much!

Hey good morning I’m trying to get some demos to you seeking agent
Wow, it's a pleasure surprise to accidentally find out that I took part in making this music video for such a talented performer (computer graphics for some of the shots)
Hermosa estoy todavía en Salt esperandote👍😊
Love this video so much and the song is too beautiful! And you are absolutely amazing my beautiful superstar ⭐ Feliz Martes mí hermosa reina 👸🎼🥀☕💙
j'aime trop cette chanson courage
Much 👍
I wonder what would come up if you scanned the barcode?
Esse clipe foi editado depois de 1 já postado ou é impressão minha ?
Seriously if there is one popstar to give competition to ariana and billie its ava max. She is steadily getting attention. Her song kings and queens is doing well on Us billboard charts slowly.
I get it's still alot of work. But there's alot to like about a more simplistic video. This is very nicely done. ❤
🥰🥰🥰
I never had a celebrity crush until Ava Max came

YESSS AVA this is IT!!
Wow...this is when you showed me Love....either I didn't react fast enough or it was just an emotional for the moment event..        or there's a screen writer who is and was aware of the military Thermal Vision they had on me, Frequencies can be felt by the brain by the way........My Speakers and Internet were tapped.........Did you all really have to erase that many of my Emails.....         My prayer moves have been put on display for US ALL to see.....but Azul they will never show.........shout out to Damian Marley * I hand drew Your Father....Bob Marley while artificially locked up a few months ago....I'll try and get it to you if possible.....and Nas......I've got patience my friends...  5 GOM's couldn't stop Me... I took it and smiled....       Now, here I'm here to set the record straight... I'm the Azul that you Love.....but you hate.....Really? Why?  ...then bend your ass in circle cause you said your love for  AZul's eternal.....        not digging those trying to play with the name like you play with yours, dig it?  I won't.....let those that love it.....handle the mess...           I like the good ol' natural Milky Weigh in Her Galaxy! Unless she begs me for it.....how can I deny Her? I'd be a seLfish man, but I won't trade Her Alma'sCore for NADA! :-)      Cause Azul will be Poppin One special Star.. One Special marathon Night....       Then round 2 and how ever many it takes for the Tiger in Azul to finish.....While she begs for more.... No apologies for the rated ER scene......keepin' it Classy....  Who wants to get married.....single life is not for Me.....still in my prime and want My next Alpha Zul......             ...Azul's love is for an Eternity....Can My Queens relate?           I spoke to soon about your other videos....Forgive Azul *US ALL*  Ms. Ava Max...I found this after the fact.....I don't wait to drop my thoughts....like I let it all Hang.....I just do  it....right then and there.....         You all witnessed it.... while I Testified about US ALL to My Celestial Father.......what did you think I was doing.....Had the weight of My Baby *Azul* and Christ  on My Shoulders...   Everything had a meaning........still does.....        stop pretending it wasn't a mix of laughs, emotions, and inspiration....        I'll be the first to admit all I needed was a soft Queens hug, kiss, and furry kitten....yes I like grown women and Like to see it in its Natural state....Just kept...Like the garden of My Eden, I found My Eve in....  -Azul
Ava max I love you

As for me She looks very nice with red hair and with minimum cosmetic it's so natural look.
Only 4.4 million for a music video? Is she loosing her touch?
AVA - ПУШКА😍
I like this, I dont know why but I like this, something so simple and catchy?
this is the freshest looking video ever
This woman is the one that gave me courage to come out as bi infont of my parents 🥰🥰😍😘😭
W blond włosach było jej lepiej
Her best single to date 🧡
OMG me and my friend are in a sleepover and we are watching this video we are so proud of Ava you are doing so good 💕☺️
Om
A BOP
Ava has defined her own genre. I like this video in that she lays bare her human body. It's not perfect but at the same time, it is. You can spend your time chasing 'Perfect', but why? Her fans could care less about her mortal coil, what they really like is how she just makes you feel okay with being you. That's all any of us need, to feel wanted.
RIP the reply button! I so love this version of ava ✨❤
The song look like a Heal Me by Lady Gaga
I thought the music video looked similar to Hilarry Duff's Sparks. And whaddaya know, both were directed by the same person!
What planet are you from? ✨😍✨
I look great in this video on the reface app.great song too
that flop omg... why? she's really great
When I play my cards ♦️ keep them close to my chest ever fall in love everybody losses my bed 🛌💯❤️♦️♦️♦️💋😍🥰😘💎

Cant say anything, she is so beautiful
Awesome
Rote haare passen nicht

There’s something about this song that keeps me coming back to hear it...over and over again. ❤️❤️❤️
Wow this gives me 90's vibes❤️😍
❤❤❤
Love it!
Can anyone see the barcodes on her clothes

سمحلي انوشتي راكي تخيل عيشي papichti الواقع نتاعك
Wow I remember when Ava Max was just starting of and my sister loved her music especially her song "My way" but now we can't even find her music video for "My way". She has come a long way and I love it!

Uma das minha preferidas do álbum
Ava is perfect... no auto tune needed n plastic surgery isn't required... shez a model goddess on her own. we love u Ava Max, all the way from Africa!!
Ava, создавая новое, не надо рушить старое,  Распостраненный стереотип мышления, Мы тебя Любим совсем не за твое тело, а за твой Голос! Все, что ты уже сделала, Достойно восхищения! не уподобся Леди Гаге,  это тупик. хм
The new trend is Ava Max...
Ava kocham cię
Leeloo from The Fifth Element :)
I genuinely can't believe that there are people who disliked this video.
I like see ava max collaborate with ariana grande.
She’s very pretty
Can we stop the idea that Ava Max is a copy cat of Lady Gaga? Ava Max is Ava Max. Period.
Then i just realized that im getting addicted to her😅😅😅
The Fifth Element vibes.
Reminds me of lelu from fifth element and shakira. Big compliment from me. Good girl!!
Ava Max........ wow 🧡
If she's giving you "Fifth Element" vibes, here's your like button. 👇🏽
Y’all fan sites on twitter doing a great job because that’s how I ended up watching this video 😂 I really like this song too.
🦋💯
I love Ava Max..i like 😘😍
Wait... is this a FIFTH ELEMENT THING?  I only was seduced by "Sweet but Psycho" and then totally lost interest.  This song is a solid 6/10. Lol, which means you're mostly talentless.   All this video is, is sex. She's hot but has little to no personality but... that's all you need in America haha
Linda ❤
The Fifth Element keeps popping up in my mind. Nice one.
she deserve alot more subscribers
I love this song
Big Fifth Element Vibes
Ava's SEXY toned voice stays with you FOR WEEKS.

HI AVA MAX YOU IS BEAUTFULL! YOUR VOICE IS PERFECT :)
Why she look like the girl from 5th Element movie
There is not one song on this album that would be considered a filler.  Perfection.
Yes the pretty not from Naked is from the Music & the Song, I feel dance in my dreams.
Неа сори но непонравилось

This girl just surprises with her vocals, except good luck nothing to wish 🙏 👍 👌 😘 ❤️ 🤗 🔥 🤝
amazing
Anybody noticed that ava has an angel face without make up ?
Amazing song 💖
why is this song so underrated
she's bringing back that 2000's Pop vibes, the sound, the visuals, everything is just perfect! A true artist Miss Ava Max, this video is just a masterpiece!  💗
Ava is a under rated artist! I'm loving her songs! 💙💜💙💜
I ❤️ youuuuuuu

This song is very good! Good job Ava ❣️
I’m impressed with her music I didn’t think she would bring this to life
Скопировала .... время и стекло...любви точка нет.

hook so good :) from tw.
I like this music is so fun :D
Me Encanta esta Canción 🥰
A nova lady gaga sera?(no email da minha mãe estou)
Ava max has literally one of the best voice of the music industry I don't know why so many people hate her.
I
This is just the beginning of it, 💫🖤 all your songs fascinate me 🇲🇽     ❤️👄❤️
Queen of pop
There’s a part that i remember of summerboy by Lady Gaga.3:20
!!!!!ZAJEBIOZA!!!!!
ava's lashes on FLEEK
Obviously 5th element thing going on.
i wonder why but the thumbnail reminds me of Britney Spears
1:47 Ava look like Mila jovovich at the 5th element💗
LADY GAGA & ARIANA GRANDE'S DAUGHTER 🥺
Love 🙈❤️🎤💃🤗
❤️❤️❤️
You are stunning!Ava Max
All fifth elements in her naked body
That eyes bring me back here.
She dressed perfectly for the video. She dressed like Mila Jovavich's Leeloo from The Fifth Element film. Its fantastic and smashed the like button
So good
Leeloo Dallas Multi-Pass!
Her hair is orange 🍊 and I cannot say no 😅
Anyone else realize that her white outfit resembles the one worn by Leeloo from: The Fifth Element(1997) The Movie Staring Bruce Willis As (Korben Dallas) & Milla Jovovich As (Leeloo)?
Atlantic Records need to move their butts niw, cause this song is so freaking amazing. Pls your promotion is so weak
Time for a Fifth Element remake
😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍 i like you
this songg is so underrated and one of her best ones
? I LOVE you, my star-Princess
Speak you German
Not to compare these amazing  beautiful ladies in a bad way because they are all unique and talented and beautiful. But who would you choose Ava Max, Halsey or Dua Lipa?  I think I would pick Ava she's the better dance than them vocally I still have a hard time deciding who's better Ava or Dua. Let me know who would you pick?
I love this song, I love u Ava,  I love your voice Good job Awesome, amazing and incredible❤️😍
Multipass lol
i love you and your music ava! <3
😀
I love this song ❤️
Week 3 Views is getting closer to the subscribers 👌
Gatissima
mundial
AVAN SEMOGA SUKSES👍👍❤❤
She doesn't hv to work much harder to b sexy cos she is already sexy n beautiful...❤️❤️❤️❤️
Producers- rip off The Fifth Elements aesthetic  And all of your fans are too young to know what the fifth element is smh.  I'm actually sad the song had nothing to do with the movie
super
My Fav song On Ava Max Channel Is Salt
(Ō~Ō)
Sorry but it's a flop...
Great👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Are you léeloo?
stevie nicks
Gorgeous and wonderfully singing Ava Max
Hello ava mix ❤️
Leeloo Multipase
I am so proud of Ava it’s the little Birdie out of it's nest🥺
This girl is awesome! 😍❤️❤️❤️👌
gorgeous
queen
I wish she never kept her life such a secret... I wish she told us more about herself... she maybe would earn more recognition perhaps...
Lelo Dallas Multipass
Looks like Leeloo in the 5th element movie. Love the song ‘ 😻
Esto es muy pop del 2000 me encanta te adoro ava max 😍😍😍
She's so pretty tho. 🥺🥺
waiting for acoustic version, kinda sad
I'm on the fence with Ava.  Vocally, WOW if it's what she truly sounds like with out auto-tune and well you know what I mean.  Visually, 2 thumbs up!  I'm not always crazy about the overdone pop look, here with subtle make-up (yes, I know she is full face), but without all the overdone and "overdressed" you see her as a human being, like us and... Ava is beautiful!  I get it. Pop crap is what sells.  It's like when Lady Gaga sings her lil monster songs (love them) and when she sings with Tony Bennett or "A Star is Born"  There is much more than a "wanna be"... Ava CAN sing.  Let see what happens.
im obsess with Ava Max Music
This is giving me fifth element vibez
I really love this fucking song 😍🥰
💜💜
The Fifth element
KatzProductions would be proud of that thumbnail
I Love That The Fifth Element Concept Just Bring Me Back To Future In 90's
I’d love to see how they build these sets. They’re fantastic and give me TLC no scrubs vibes
I better go see myself naked🤣😂🤣
Bella

Si mi mamá revisa el historial va a salir "Ava max naked (Ava max desnuda)" 😩

Masterpiece

Love music Ava max
I saw this on spotify  i did remember  this song from that playlist  truly
sounds a bit like Love me harder x some 80s songs
I love her taste for the melodies!! This one is one of my favorites songs from the album, along OMG, Sweet But Psycho, Call Me Tonight and Belladonna
Milla Jovovich would be so proud 😎😊
I truly believe that Ava Max is the best artist at the moment. Her music is much better than the rest. I am not very into pop music, but this is good stuff
I wonder if she has a sister called Pepsi Max 😍😊
Ava just looks GORGEOUS in this video ❤️❤️

❤🤧
Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame   Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name  I've been playin' a fool since I stepped into the game  Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain   But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest  Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet  But underneath, I just need to forget  So come and get me undressed   Well, you can take off all my clothes  And never see me naked  See me for real  If you don't know my heart  You're never gonna break it  Baby  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul  I wanna show you my deepest secrets  I think I'm ready to be exposed  I want you watching me  When you take off all my clothes  And really see me naked  See me for real   If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard  Promise that you'll see me for truth and not my scars   But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest  Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet  But underneath, I just need to forget  So come and get me undressed   Well, you can take off all my clothes  And never see me naked  See me for real  If you don't know my heart  You're never gonna break it  Baby  Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul  I wanna show my deepest secrets  I think I'm ready to be exposed  I want you watching me  When you take off all my clothes  And really see me naked  See me for real   If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you  Lay my head on your chest and just surrender  Just surrender to you   Well, you can take off all my clothes  And never see me naked  If you don't know my heart  You're never gonna break it, yeah  (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul  I wanna show young deepest secrets  I think I'm ready to be exposed  I want you watching me  When I take off all my clothes   And really see me naked  See me for real
your voice is divine ava
Love you ava you stand for being different that’s why I love you girlllllllllllll  🌈❤️💁🏻‍♂️

2:03 the "yeeeaaaah" in the background sounds similar to Ariana🖤🖤🖤🖤✨
Her voice sounds so pretty in this song it shows more potential. I love how she makes a song about naked look so pure and innocent. True Artist❤
Ava’s like an onion. She has layers
This is legit 3:2 aspect ratio in 2020
This song should be in the charts really good
all natural no surgery
Всё правильно, Ава. Молодец!
Anyone likes Ava fluorescent hair ??
I love this video plsssssss do a video named cover up this a song request thank you!!💓💞
Gooood that is soooo bad. That's a copy of a copy. She looks like gaga, signs like gaga, unfortunately this song is not as fancy as gaga used to have. And I don't even talk about the costume from the 5th element. Fake

Mom: What are you watching on your mobile ? Me: It's complicated :/           -  a circle spinning around...  YouTube: Should I put this comment under the latest NCS-Video ??
Lucas 3. 14: ''A pregação de João Batista Mateus 3.1-12'' ''14 E uns soldados o interrogaram também, dizendo: E nós que faremos? E ele lhes disse: A ninguém trateis mal nem defraudeis, e contentai-vos com o vosso soldo.''  {Fonte: Sociedade Bíblica do Brasil. Bíblia Sagrada - Almeida Revista e Corrigida 1969 .

''O soldo e a prata  Sem querer trair Jesus, hoje, aos trinta de junho, tomo para mim todas as trinta moedas de prata citadas na Bíblia, como assunto muito importante e interessantíssimo.  Embora pareça estranha a citação, no livro de Mateus, de profecia de Jeremias, ligando aos acontecimentos entre Judas Iscariotes, os príncipes dos sacerdotes e os anciãos do povo, me parece que Mateus, o publicano, não erraria na contagem de dinheiro em autos tão relevantes, como os descritos em Mateus 26 e 27.   Hoje, dia de partida de sete tentos, digo que o soldo justo vale mais que qualquer prata roubada.  Quanto ao profeta Jeremias, citado por Mateus, digo que, como ele, eu como que também já fui raptado para o calabouço; e sofro ameaças até hoje, pois os diabos ainda exercem abominável controle no mundo de hoje.   Sem querer parecer arrojado, mas sim sendo verdadeiro e sincero, digo que o nascimento do meu filho me foi vaticinado na manhã do Dia dos Pais, quatrocentos e catorze dias antes de seu nascimento, através de um sonho, em que uma voz me disse para ler Lucas 1; e acordando eu logo em seguida, fui-me imediatamente ler. E li; acreditei; emocionei-me; agradeci a Deus pela resposta às minhas orações, que eu vinha fazendo; pedindo por um filho.  Agradeço a Lucas e a Zacarias, também; bem como vários outros participantes Bíblicos; eles me são úteis até hoje. Inclusive, eu até já rompi laços de família.  Filho, te amo! Fica com Deus! Beijos!  Glória a Deus!  Aleluia!  São Paulo, 30 de junho de 2018. Fábio Luís Amaral dos Anjos''

Best singer ever😍💕 I love you so so so much🥺💗 I hope that I will meet you one day🥺🔥💖❣️
Ai love ava max
Ava Max has grown so much as an artist from Sweet But Psycho and Kings and Queens, this is an absolute bop and I can't stop listening to Born To The Night and Tattoo, I do hope she does blow up but I also low-key feel like she's an uncut gem 💎 such an underated artist
From VIETNAM with luv 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
Now i have to delete my history everytime i listened to this...or at least before my friends come over and say: "yo lets watch yt"
you are the best
And her friend name is max
My daughter s name is Ava it is such a beautiful name
She's "the" best
Ich weiß nicht , warum  Du das  machst  naked  ist ein bisschen ekelhaft  aber ich mag  das du so  bist  💋❤💗🇩🇪🌈💏🎵😎🦄🍉🌏🎶🏳️‍🌈
unpopular opinion: this is the one of the best songs on the album
I get some The Cure vibes from watching it. The video is great tho.
Ava sei più brava di così. Peccato poteva essere un nuovo tormentone...
This may have not been on purpose but it was such a good idea to name this song "Naked", because when people type "Ava Max naked", this comes up instead. Such a smart move.
Cool
Ava Max 👑 la siguiente artista del año 👑👑👑
hermoso video.
Cringey music video but good song
Of course this is just my opinion you guys are free to disagree with me but, I think this applies to both men and women that it's a metaphor for expressing yourself.
2 min .... so poor
*PRETTY FEET...*
This song is a masterpiece <3
Multi-pass.

👌
Ouça - NAKED - na Rádio RCN portalradiorcn.com
The visual of Ava in the white outfit and orange hair reminded me of Leeloo from the movie Fifth Element. I realize it may not have been the intended visual, but it just made me think of that. I also mean that entirely as a compliment because Leeloo was badass.
Help. I'm addicted! This song is sooooooooooo good! 😊 So good!
Marina Lambrini + Lady Gaga ------------------------- = Ava Max
I´m a Little Monster - that doesn´t prevent me from also admiring Ava

I love her songs ❤️❤️❤️
Ava Max promesa del pop ❤🥺

The Fifth Element - Leeloo
the American dream is so far away
Excellent song, as always, Ava Max have done a good job. I would like the next single was "Rumors", that is by far the best song of the whole album (in my opinion).

Que bueno suena esto! Lve Ava 😍
ㄓㄉㄓ.私立是自治的意思.中囯大陸在聯合國提告.訴說中囯軍方的戰鬥機 被竊賊偷開到臺灣.而臺灣執政當局{應是中國國民黨執政期間}收贓物.掩護包庇並且稱呼偷機竊賊為反共義士.還給予獎金.顯有利誘竊賊偷竊之實.因此要求聯合國集體抵制臺灣惡行.那麼中國國民黨常說從大陸帶了黃金到臺灣.那批黃金也是贓物嗎?根據法律規定.是不能收贓物的.話說解鈴還需繫鈴人.沒有揪出當時收贓物的執政黨來說明交代.是無法平息兩岸糾紛的.

this song is really good and shows a new side to Ava she knows how to make good nostalgic pop songs:) but releasing as a single on the album release date mmm not the best decision :o it got lost in the whole thing i bet many didn't realize its a new single and its not being pushed i guess

@Ava Max ppl Literally hate your event on roblox all the items are for robux so that why ur events has more dislikes than thumbs up

This is so good
I love it!
My favourite song👍
If this songs doesn't have 100M views in 1 month then It's underrated
I'm feeling 5th element vibes
I bet that in a maximum one week this video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbWnE-_llNI will surpass the one we are seeing now   I just like this guy and his idea, it's so simple and I think that I want to help him out with it, I want to see if it really works what he says, so let’s give him a hand dudes, we have nothing to lose And another reason would be that creepy song in the background, I don't know what it is but I love it...:>>
This song is soooo f***ing good😍
she's so beautiful ❤
This song ❤
Ava Max knows how to make good songs.
amazing artist ava max

Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this pain Ask me what they used to say, that trouble was my name I've playin' a fool, since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed Boy, you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I let you leave the light, I'll never drop my guard Promise that you see me for my truth and not my scars But when I play my cards, I keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed, yeah, yeah Boy, you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real If I keep my distance, I can't connect with you Lay my head on your chest, and just surrender Just surrender to, you Boy, you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it Oh, oh-oh Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
i love you so much!!

How Many of You Think that She's Totally Looking Like and has the Voice, Energy and Vibe of Lady Gaga?!🤩❤😍
She looks almost perfect! Just needs blue eyes!
Don't try to search for this song and write "naked"
Totally in love with this song ♥ So perfect!
Great 👏

🔥 *lyrics* 🔥  [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say the trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to, you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it (Oh) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
whos here, where. ava was exopod for being a racist??
Ava Max is so underrated
Ava que orgullo decir que soy tu fan desde el principio, y estoy orgulloso de ver que has crecido bastante!!! Mexico te ama✨✨✨✨

Ava Dallas Multipass 💖
I am loving everything I hear by this amazing woman...and I really appreciate the "Fifth Element" vibe she injected into this video! Anyone who's seen the movie didn't miss it!!♥♥♥
I caught that Blondie reference at the beginning (wrap me in designer sheets) from Call Me, nice nod Ava! :)

This video is giving me fifth element vibes. Love that movie and this video. So cool!
it sounds good but i don't like to stare at naked people.
Тут Ава уж больно напоминает раннюю Надю Дорофееву или Леди Гагу в клипе "Bad Romance"
I love you music Ava Max🖤🤘🏼🤙🏼💜
It's hard to decide which is better. The video or the song. Ava Max is simply fascinating. With or without clothes, it really doesn't matter at all :)
❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🇧🇷
My ava
I loveee you!!
She's so fine......and then there's her voice ✌😍💗💗💗💗💗💗
I saw ava max on roblox
This song have such a DISCO vibe. I love it
*"Take You to Hell"* deserved a video rather than this one.
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful in life, God bless you.
Love you  lot Ava max 😍💖
J'adore ava max de toute mon coeur 😍😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹

Egg decent at best Lin Manuel is a better  artist go listen to his songs instead
Okay WOW. I knew she was pretty but DAMN she's so ethereal omg  😭❤
Fifth Element reference is random but appreciated.
Anyone Realize, Ava has insanely long eyebrows
At about 1:47 I got a "5th Element" vibe". And this could have easily been an 80's or 90's mega hit. Great Song.
I love the new look, awesome song,too!!!
Subscribed!!!!

German and French fan
elle est trop belle <3
damn I'm not sure about this song but it catches me so baaad ❤️
Future lady gaga  😍i really loved this ❤️💕song
Why do you have red hair and why do you look like you just came out of a receipt machine? Lol and you look much different
If you don't know my heart, you're never gonna break it✌️
Clickbait

what a magnificent talent congratulations love you ,Ava 💙
She´s so hot,so sexy
♥️
so good ! i love ava max !
Lov love 💘
How is this soooo underrated. This is arttttt, come on!!!
Too good 👍👍
this is Do What You Want but non scandalus
Gorgeous
Bad romance?!?! so nice
someone has to be naked there
U in roblox
The first thing that came to my mind while watching this video was that it has the vibes of early Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears music videos. Love it.  And this song is so good. Not a hardcore fan of Ava, but this song is a bop. Love the 80's influence beats. Cheers.
So many feelings in one song! Love it. I hope at least one person will read my whole comment, and I wish you an awesome day!       I am a 23-year-old singer-songwriter of French, Czech & German origins. I play the guitar, the piano, the Irish whistle, the harp, and I love to dance. My life goal is to make people feel fulfilled and inspire them through my music, and to create soundtracks for movies. I post my own original songs on my channel as well as covers. It's a difficult path to follow, as it is tough to get recognition online nowadays without paid promotion. I'm planning to release an album this year with many songs, but for this I would need your support. If you have a moment, please check out one of my videos and tell me what you think. Every single view, like, comment... counts a lot. Please give this a thumbs-up so that others can see it. Many thanks, and I can't wait to read your comments. 😊 💋
The german radio loves ava max. They always play her Songs like 10 Times a day
she's so amazing 🥺🥺🥺
It's like a combination of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance and Britney Spear's Toxic
tak best.. sorry
Perfect❤❤
You are amazing dear Ava..😭❤️ Love you always 💋❤️

meu Deus é a PATROA!

been following ava since sweet but phycho. she's really good.
♡
Ava mac in roblox whaaaattttt how is this allowed
Guys play roblox.bc they are ava max event it will free item
Love it!!! The Best!!!
Everyone keeps asking why she doesn’t have more of the spotlight. She will once she stops looking like a copy of other popular artists. Yes like fashion, music is a cycle and everyone is influenced by everyone but when you present visuals that just make people think of bigger stars that did it first you get overlooked. Even with lady Gaga being compared to Madonna at first, she still brought so much to the table musically and visually that she was respected on her own and still so unique. Ava just looks like a gorgeous talented woman that dressed up like her idol and called it a day
Love the Song
Urang resep iyeu😍
This is very early 2000s, love it!
Who Come Here For The Roblox Event? / quien vino aca por el evento de roblox?

거미🕷다리같은 속눈썹도 잘어울려 언니 최고야....노래도 좋아💛
She is so divine in this video, love the visuals (and maybe a little Filth Element influence? lol MULTIPASS). So obsessed wth the chorus!
Don't take the good lord's name in Vain it is against the commandments

Reminds videoclip of "Please" by Robin Gibb
I feel she made this to show how confident she is with her body
Wow this is a BOP. I hope it gets to Hot 100 🔥
This is really good. The vocals. The visuals. Everything was a masterpiece!!!! I love it. Cheers for Ava's success❤
Why is this being advertised on a children's channel??!!! Absolutely disgusting
Her songs are FIRE!!
This is the song that i really like😍😭 I hope u too🥰
Omg I love love love this video! 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Yassss Ava 😍😍
Shakira?
"Tell me if it's safe to bare my SOUL I want to show you my deepest.....SECRET"  Almost had me
This song is do amaizing and ava have a beautivful voice
The music video gives me "human" by Christina Perri vibes, this may be my favorite song from her album, although Kings and Queens and Take You to Hell are also strong contenders
She's amazing ♡
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
sooooooo cute without make up, wow ♥️
How been here since her first song ?? (Includes me)  👇🏻
And then I was transported to 2014
Alright I don't like pop music but, I was just browsing new releases on Spotify and skimmed through her album and its really good. Not something I would personally play like that but, I will say as a music head her music compared to other pop artist seems way better.
Очень красивый клип! Молодцы!!! Здорово очень!!  Прошу ответные лайк и подписку на канал:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNbZRUwzRZg&t=82s
Damn She Looks Good
Am I going crazy or did you guys also hear the first 4 seconds of Billie Jean at 3:17? Taking that as an Easter egg :p
O yll i bukur .qe ndricon dit per dit per dit .me shum
Imma need a Gaga remix
Ava I'm proud of you you bring one song after another madness
I don't think she's found her own image yet. Yes she's known for that cut but she goes for a completely different look on every music video. But shes only known for one song and a hairstyle. That's not good.  She has potential, i can see so much energy on her. But she needs to take more control on her image and what shes going for. I can't get her off bubblegum pop because of that one song 2 years ago. I think she could be a big star but she needs to chill and stop doing soooo much at once. One step at a time and dont change into so different looks, were still trying to get to know ava max and shes not letting us this way.
Wonderful, this is more than I expected.
Sponsoring by beats by dr dre
Born to the Night and Tattoo should be the next singles!!!!!!!
I want cheeto hair.
Perfect😍
Anybody got a new Vice City Vibes?) The song is actually brilliant!
I was watching AGT, last night and when I heard she was gonna perform at the results show I started freaking out! She’s  so amazing ❤️✨💕

Imagine how now many people are looking for ava max naked on google. Other fellas may think we're perverts, when in fact all we want is the song.

Thank U Next - Mean Girls and more...911 - The Colour of Pomegranates... Naked - The Fifth Element ? I love them both. Lady Gaga x Ariana Grande x Ava Max = QUEENS 👑👸👸👸
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Now await the release of the music video for "OMG What's Happening", also directed by Hannah Lux Davis. If you go to Ava and Hannah's Instagram and see the September 2 post on both accounts, you will see a photo of the music video. Wikipedia says about the following about the song: "On September 2, 2020, American music video director Hannah Lux Davis announced her involvement in the" OMG What's Happening "music video on her social media accounts. Prior to the video's release, Max mentioned that it involved a large truck and several fast muscle cars in the desert. A lyric video was released on YouTube which coincided with the song's release."
*Ava Max should* *Collab with Nova Miller*
Elfen lied ❤
She should make a official video for "not your barbie girl". The scene should be like: she in a toy shop as a Barbie doll in the packaging but wearing a black outfit instead of pink or purple signature barbie dresses. *it would be a disaster*
why do i feel like she turned into like Miley Cyrus
so good!!!!
dead meat

She looks like Leela from The Fifth Element
Lady gaga + Christina aguilera combined = ava
The clip make me to remember the "5th Element" Movie :D
Kings and queens, salt, OMG! What's happening and Naked are my favourite songs of "Heaven and Hell"
This is my fave song by her
Lol this song not so bad and not so good ok :/
This video is very beautiful, you are very talented!
Im scared to watch the video bc like... look how its called..
Estilo "el quinto elemento"

I thought we lost lady gaga
Awesome video Ava!👍 I remember when she just had just around 400 000 subscribers! Congrats!
💜Am I the only person who thinks she looks a little like shakira when the face is zoomed without the fake lashes?💜
With every new release 😍 She is getting better and better Surprisingly gorgeous ❤
Op
Great Song!!! The sounds reminds Carly Rae Jepsen's E•MO•TION!!!
Thanks for the long awaited album Ava 💖💖💖
Something is different about her but i don't know what🤔 Maybe she got a new lipstick...🤔
everytime I search this song I have to push really quick, youtube is so gross haha
ava max is superior I need a slow sad melody song by her pleaseee
Dumm
Roi! Melhor cantora neh?

Her music reminds me of the Britney , Xtina, Gaga  old school Pop
I'm getting strong the fifth element vibes
Akala ko si jenelyn mercado
You can take off all my clothes and never see m naked, as you never, see me for real 👌👌👌👌👌
nothing special about the song or the artist that hasn't already been done.

Plagiat "double je" Christophe Willem, je parle de l'instru pas de la meuf
this song is a bop! 🔥 love u AVA!!! a proud fan here 💓
When she say undressed the vocal like ari😍 2:00
Eva max iconic
Keep going Amanda 👌💞💥

For me she is one of those singers that I watch for her songs than her looks, even though she is hot as hell 😍😍
I'm an  'into your arms' Fan Expecting more such masterpieces from you 😍😍
cool
She delivered what DWUW couldn’t deliver
Lyrics https://youtu.be/NmBrWzj0Dkc
your voice is amazing.
I’m gonna crash that LIKE button
I love you AVA MAX
One word !!! WOW !!! Okay,  more words. I LOVE HER !!!
This has a 90's vibe touch into it from the music video and the looks! I'm here for it! The music sounds like it was dropped in the era of Katy Perry's Teenage Dream and Kesha's Tiktok.
“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire” “Good Luck”
まつ毛なげー！ｗ
more songs like this one and less songs like so am i and who's laughing now. way less generic and corny.
Хоть и не имею музыкального слуха но слышу тут совсем другую песню,особенно в припеве а вот какую вспомнить не могу
Love this MV from Ava Max.
Ava the night you released sweet but Psycho, you cried a lot thinking if it was going to succeed or not, obviously, it succeeded as you have to continue to succeed. I love what you do and you inspire me in many moments. So, I thank you for not stopping what you do, wonders. I love you. Keep it up and you will go very far. 😍😘
Ava Marathon... <3
Yes Queen, love you Ava😍❤
No puedo. Es la copia de Lady Gaga pero mas joven, osea, en sus comienzos. Ya la tenemos a Gaga, Katy Perry. Estilo propio no tiene.
She's not that artist who gets 100 million views,but Ava is the artist that can prove us that she can sing.
Fat
This song reminds me of late 2000s and early 2010s vibes
Brazil loves you, Ava! <3
Anybody thinks Ava Max is the Avril Lavigne of this generation?
Chandelier sia style?
Mê chị dã man luôn ý ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ranndi

Always Masterpiece Ava Max 🔥🔥 so much Love 😘
Beautiful girl n talented, but very odd look. I guess for attention,  but i bet when she's dressed all natural and normal. Shes much more beautiful

LYRICS:  [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real         HOPE IT WAS HELPFUL 😀😀
She is sooo good  <3
Is she Latina?
Só eu que acho a Ava Max a nova Lady Gaga? Kk

Never care about views and awards. Just see the talent. Good job Ava. Love from Pakistan
she looks like a mixture between lady gaga, ariana grande and shakira
Very 00's, I like it
Is that Sia & Lady Gaga's crossover?
She's got a talent, she's got a voice, she's got a boobs!
Sponsored by beats

Ava max you so brave in this song so good and beautiful thank you ava cause you song naked song
Why aren't we talking about her FEET?
This a well put together song and the 5th element vibe works!
she's 🔥
Смотрю  клип вспоминается фильм Пятый элемент
ava max is the new pop singer in the music industry! she does a good job and she will go a long way!
ME : MULTIPASS.!!
Let's call this song barely naked though ;) :D
👍😈
I wanna hear this as a ballad OMG💖💖
Nice
Don’t get me wrong she’s fireee and has talent but she takes A LOT of ideas off other artists fashion and video ideas and makes slight twists on them. She sings good songs that others write for her BUT she’s not original when it comes to her visual videos.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😘😘😘😘😘
🎶🌹☕💙
<3 <3 <3 <3
5th element
Why is this video not on apple musicccccc
Been with you since Sweet But Psycho Look at where you are at now😍
i love you
Watching From Algeria🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿
Ava Max is like a drug, once you addict you can't stop listening to her songs 😍 Agree??
Is the video 4:3 because it's supposed to be reminiscent of older times ?
She looks pretty in ginger hair😱 It fits her🔥
I wonder if the 5th Element was the inspiration for this video. This song is gorgeous.
Why isn’t everyone holding a flashlight or magnifying glass over Ava Max! She needs more of the spotlight than she deserves!! Hello?? Am I the only ??!!!
you can take off all my clothes and never see me naked. What a line!!
why naked its so ugly there are infinet word so why naked
The costumes remind me of the 5th Element movie in the 90’s. 😘
This looks like something from 2000s
Idk it's something about this angel like voice that catches me in every song, just amazing never had this with another artist before 😊
This is so good <3
Great
Her hair makes me want spaghetti.
she’s really beautiful in her simple make up 🧡
Esta chica me gusta su música como canta y sus canciones
Is anyone going to mention that this orange hair look made her look similar to Shakira in some angles?...just me? OK. 😛 😂
Every ava's song is good
Amazing 💙🧡
Joe bide: 👁 👄 👁
It's too good to listen to 😍😘
PERFEIÇÃOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Que música perfeita cheguei com 3 dias né meio atrasadíssimo né.

Love you Ava
언니 수영복 화보 찍어?
This video is so early 2000's ... LOVE IT!
amei tanto essa música ❤
Leeloo vibes anyone?
She is gorgeous.....
So come and get me a dress.
Grande Ava Max te amo ♥️
Listen to ME GUSTA- Anitta feat. Card B & Mike Towers
She need dress ...🤣ask directly ...
Idk about the shaved brow
Beautiful song. ❤
Leeloo Mood
This track is so  wonderful,, I can play it allday long and more,, because so beautiful, No matter what everybody say. This is your best song (I think)
what a serve! ☁️🔥✨
Me gusta. Ella es como una versión mejorada de Gaga.
No es por nada pero porque Ava saca tantas canciones? Me hace acordar al caso de Paulo Londra que lo estaban explorando, espero que no sea lo mismo
If you dislike this then you’re a simp.
Getting a strong Fifth Element vibe from this video
IS THAT AN EYEBROW SLIT??? *QUEEN*
She said "the 5th element but make it VOGUE"
Good music, I never not liked one of her songs
someone been Watching the 5th element... Ava Dallas Multi Pass~!!
Views for ava max  kings & queens 100 million who's laughing now 50 million  naked 10 million
Why she's dressing like Leeloo?
5th Element vibes. Awesome!
Ava's a such great artist.
try tocut thenextto210secaa
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them.Non-Duality
This music is so good!!! Sending love from Brazil
Love you Ava best singer of all time
This music video gives Bad Romance vibes.
eu to obcecado
0:40 like yo glow in the dark hair ava nice touch :) lol
Oh Ava thank you for helping me get through my darkest time I don’t know what to do anymore ...
I'm obssesed.
Love this song. Love that Bonnie McKee helped write this BOP. But I absolutely LOVE the 5th Element references! Best on the album by miles.
Sex sells, cool costume designs anyway.
That's a good song             Sexy too
I love this song it's a good song you're amazing Ava Max amazing
Multipass!
This is so fucking good <3
Reminds me of Kylie Minogue - Love At First Sight
She reminds me Lady Gaga if she was are a teenager lol I like Ava and Gaga
THE BEST SONG BY AVA SO FAR
Like all Albanian  🇦🇱
If all you people think that success is more fame or money, you are wrong. She is a music icon for me, she is rich, beautiful, doing what she loves. The more fame the more complicated life that doesn't even belong to you. She is winning. She doesn't need 50 million followers on Insta or Youtube. She is SUCCESS.
This is definitely my favorite song of the album and I live for the Lilo from the 5th Element outfit. Milla Jovovich is that girl ❤   I can relate so much with the lyrics. Ava looks heavily beautiful here.
❤
Will play on DACLEU-RADIO.COM
LISTEN "ME GUSTA" ANITTA FT CARDI B AND MYKE TOWERS
wow, a song that's just not so good. About time tho, ALL her other songs are amazing!
nice clickbait
Lilou Dallas multipass !!! This song is so love. Ava your voice is howesome that's crazy please don't stop !!!
feeling the vibes from the movie "The Fifth Element"
Omggg!!! Love the resolution
I love this song hope to find the cd soon

I'm hearing this song for 78th time and everytime it is hitting me differently. Lots of love from India see you soon AVA.
Lady gaga ??
Полюбила её всей душой
❤️A NATURAL BEAUTY❤️
Not bad, not great :) cuz this song it s a  old version, which remember me of kardi b and nicki minaj, it s same pop music with 90% naked body (where is the originality?). I enjoy the song, it chill me but i fell the lack of interest from managers, it s very easy to see the low support, anyway she is a wonderfull super star.
This sounds so heaveny!!😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️
literally my fav on the album
Naked song so excellent you so beautiful and pretty your voice so  so good
You can take off all my clothes and now you see me naked - Ava Max
OH SUPER Ava Max
Dans ces vidéos elle fais des placements de produits punaise 😤😣moi qui était fan😢😭
Fifth element vibes
She reminds me of lady gaga FR THOUGH. 💀💀😭😭
Love this song her new album lit 🔥
Cântico aos ramos ao vento  Peço bênçãos, peço aval;  Espalho versos em flores, cheias de odores e amores;  Para muito além dos Açores; Pela terra e pelo céu; Livre, sem cela, olhando para as estrelas;  Sem dolo, e sem dó, preparando minha mó.  Sinto um passado similar ao presente; Trocando-se presentes passados; Que poderiam estar ultrapassados; Como que repletos de serpentes a sibilar; E como que com estrelas-cadentes molhadas e corruptas, aquecidas em prostituição.   O bom futuro, com cortesia, nos espera; E para que não fiquemos nem ociosos, nem ociosas, tomo uma decisão:  Combaterei o mal, sem demora, pois que sem medo eu fico.  E, após aval contra injustiça: Eu me prontifico; Com ou sem vendaval, arvorar-me-ei como que pela lúdica e gloriosa batalha naval.  Peço bênçãos, agradeço aval; Que Deus nos ilumine e nos livre de todo o mal!  Desobrigado, eu te digo: Te amo Jesus! Glória a Deus! Amém!   Caraguatatuba, 23 de junho de 2018. Fábio Luís Amaral dos Anjos
I hope everyone that is reading this is having a really good day
Are see the treu kiss joy thanks hopefully too peace one love
Omfg i have too split in mine eyebrow
A AVA MAX É UMA FILHA PERDIDA DA LADY GAGA KKKK. DUAS LINDAS, 💟
Did anybody else think of the Fifth Element???
This reminds me Liloo character from 5th Elements movie hahaha She was my favorit
Hoje, revisitando meu texto "Dei-me à luz", do dia 23 de abril de 2018, percebi uma falha no mesmo, que poderia gerar más interpretações. Assim, o texto hoje aperfeiçoado: Ao invés de "mundo normal", expresso-me melhor utilizando "mundo naturalmente normal, puro e natural". Desculpem-me por qualquer inconveniente causado por esse meu engano. Aliás, qualquer um que encontrar outros erros em meus textos, por favor, me avise. Tenho todo o interesse de não dizer, nem escrever, mentiras nem falsidades. Busco pela perfeição. Segue a nova versão do texto:  Dei-me à luz; corrigindo-me  Fui cego, mas agora vejo. Fui surdo, mas agora ouço. Fui mudo, mas agora falo. Fui coxo, mas agora ando. De fato e de feto dou graças a Deus!   A criança nasce depois que se rompe a bolsa da madre, e logo que é trazida das trevas à luz é banhada. Mas, se já não nasce clamando,  antes, apanha; depois respira melhor.   A mulher desobediente, para fugir do castigo, não temente, mas com dó, paga para muita gente, que a livre da mó.   Assim, para não ter trabalho, vende o salário ao plenário, que corta sua entranha e banha de sangue a mesa.   Essa situação sem beleza já nem se estranha, mas não que seja normal.  Ó Deus, como eu gostaria de um mundo naturalmente normal, puro e natural!   São Paulo, 02 de julho de 2018. Fábio Luís Amaral dos Anjos
She is a beautiful singer, has a beautiful personality,  and is just a beautiful person...  I hope I can meet her someday
Сиськи конечно топ!
there is so much music in the world....

The aesthetics are amazing!   The way it was shot reminded me a lot of 2000's music video, but with the quality of modern music videos (like it isn't trying to copy 100% the 2000's style by putting some filters which are becoming really jarring)
She trying pull off fifth element in this video ?

i love you ava !! sending you love from morocco
Lol is doll
yassss Queen let's go
Why the hell you shoot a video in 3:4 format in 2020. Ahh yess...to remember us that both the Song and video is something ALREADY done, you are just copying things. This old fashioned predicts a 3 albums career.
Mi hermosa reina te amo😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
literally each song from her is a masterpiece
Your style is soooo Gaga 2013. Please do something more original.
Nice song is this new song I wonder
Love the song and the video. Also, was waiting for her to say MULTIPASS.
She's beautiful and her voice 😍
That orange hair and outfit reminds of The Fifth Element!
Literally 1% people who are seeing this may your parents live more than 💯 years             🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

Intense eyelash work hahahaha

❤❤❤🤧🤧
Thank me later. Verse 1 Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked

😉

Wieder mal ein Meisterwerk :)
Feels like the 5th Element. Copied the movie character. Disappointing :)
Love you Avaaaa

When you're searched 'naked', there's something different appear on search results 😶😳
Thank you Alan for introducing us to this angel!
I am your fans .from indonesia ❤️❤️
Thats a interesting Remake of The fifth Element :P
You don’t know my heart, you’ll never break it 🥰🥰
Love it reminds of the 90’s vibe
I felt a reference to the 1997 movie "The Fifth Element." The video was perfect and impeccable
Ava's other singles far superior, this one would skip over. Sounds like a lot of other artists as well!
People say she is the next lady gaga. No she is the first Ava Max.
Happy Wonderful a Present Good Luck Universal Nice To Love You a Ultra Sexy💃
Dentro de unos años Ava Max sera una estelarista del pop, tiene bastante talento ademas de ser una hermosa damita

Im curious what the barcodes would say if they were scanned.....
[Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

It really reminds me of “Easy” by Bonnie McKee. So good!
Queen maravillosa ♥️😍👌
Why the hell in 4:3???
Poxa, a Ava Max deveria fazer feats com cantores mais famosos para ela ficar mais conhecida. É uma otima cantora!

1:22 She looks like Mystique from X-men. QUEEN AVA❤️
V element
*Remember: This song will be so iconic*
This song and video did it for me, ok I’m a fan now.
No one. Nobody.  Hold my eyelashes.
Who did this intense lash makeup look? I NEED those lashes.
I envy her body and beauty 😭
THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF EARLY 2000'S
Amo essa música 💕
This has fifth element written all over it
Anyone here before this video hits a million   If u are then turn this button to blue👇
I'm surprised there is no comments about the 4:3 ratio instead of widescreen. Looks great in "normal" view but strange in fullscreen.   The song was amazing though! :D
I dont know but I think it's her best MV  The early 2000s and 90s aesthetic and vibes are DAZZLING MYSELF
Look a bit like the movie the Fifth Element?
another brilliant song xx
I love Ava. One of the best voices of the POP. Fantastic song and.MV. 👏👏👏
Someone else doing an Ava Max marathon?
The Orange looks so good on her... Perfection..❤️🇦🇱

The VOCALS!! 🔥🤘
When Ava Max Say:   "If you don't know my heart, you never gonna break it"   Bro, I really feel that 😔😔
OUUUUU, WE GOT A NEW SONG, WE STAN A TALENTED QUEEN
Reminds me to Milla Jovovich in the Fifth Element 🧡
Tłumaczenie polskie Tłumacz  ANGIELSKI POLSKI Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain. But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed. Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real. If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars. But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed. Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real. If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you. Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real Owiń mnie w arkusze projektantów i śledź wzdłuż tej ramki Zapytaj mnie, dlaczego mówili, że ten problem to moje imię Grałem głupka, odkąd wszedłem do gry Powiedz mi, że jestem jak Niebo, na próżno bierz imię dobrego Pana. Ale kiedy gram w swoje karty, trzymaj je blisko mojej piersi Nigdy się nie zakochuj, każdy przegrywa zakład Ale pod spodem po prostu muszę zapomnieć Więc chodź i rozbierz mnie. Cóż, możesz zdjąć wszystkie moje ubrania I nigdy nie zobacz mnie nagiego Zobacz mnie naprawdę Jeśli nie znasz mojego serca Nigdy tego nie złamiesz Niemowlę Powiedz mi, czy można bezpiecznie obnażyć moją duszę Chcę ci pokazać moje najgłębsze sekrety Myślę, że jestem gotowy na ujawnienie Chcę, żebyś mnie obserwował Kiedy zdejmiesz moje ubranie I naprawdę zobacz mnie nago Zobacz mnie naprawdę. Jeśli pozwolę ci zostawić włączone światło i opuszczę gardę Obiecaj, że zobaczysz mnie z powodu mojej prawdy, a nie moich blizn. Ale kiedy gram w swoje karty, trzymaj je blisko mojej piersi Nigdy się nie zakochuj, każdy przegrywa zakład Ale pod spodem po prostu muszę zapomnieć Więc chodź i rozbierz mnie. Cóż, możesz zdjąć wszystkie moje ubrania I nigdy nie zobacz mnie nagiego Zobacz mnie naprawdę Jeśli nie znasz mojego serca Nigdy tego nie złamiesz Niemowlę Powiedz mi, czy można bezpiecznie obnażyć moją duszę Chcę ci pokazać moje najgłębsze sekrety Myślę, że jestem gotowy na ujawnienie Chcę, żebyś mnie obserwował Kiedy zdejmiesz moje ubranie I naprawdę zobacz mnie nago Zobacz mnie naprawdę. Jeśli zachowam dystans, nie mogę się z tobą połączyć Połóż głowę na twojej piersi i po prostu się poddaj Po prostu poddaj się tobie. Cóż, możesz zdjąć wszystkie moje ubrania I nigdy nie zobacz mnie nagiego Jeśli nie znasz mojego serca Nigdy tego nie złamiesz, tak (Och, ty) Powiedz mi, czy można bezpiecznie obnażyć moją duszę Chcę ci pokazać moje najgłębsze sekrety Myślę, że jestem gotowy na ujawnienie Chcę, żebyś mnie obserwował Kiedy zdejmiesz moje ubranie I naprawdę zobacz mnie nago Zobacz mnie naprawdę

I remember that she barely had 1 million subscribers back then and here she is now slaying the world!  *The album is worth the wait! It's been 2 f'ng years!lol*
I love her somehow..but i don't really prefer this song.. don't really prefer women too sexy..
the old vibes this music has, are amazing
So we all went out and buy everything in 16/9 format and now we have a resurgence in 4/3. Looks good on my iPad pro 12.9 at least lol

This song is prove that Ava Max is original, fresh...not a copy cat Lady Gaga. Her singing voice is her  unique signature. She has grown mature and do not need to be associated with other famous singers. Greetings from Malaysia!!
Wow, now I know what people mean when they say:"NEVER clicked so fast!!"🤩😍

A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit next to you?" The girl replied with a loud and angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! All the people in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl calmly walked to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what the man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed huh? The boy replied loudly: $ 500 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy whispered in her ear "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ...    🤭 If you like the comment, "write" on my channel ... I know I misspelled the spelling and grammar 🤗 But YouTube does not allow the promotion. .. It only takes 5 seconds, thanks ❤️🙏🏻 [     If you don't want to sub *** e, that's fine, but don't spread the hate 🤗❤️ '] Have a nice day 😊😊😊🙃🙃

Peace my brothers, repent of your sins and accept Jesus as Savior of your life, his coming is near and he will take many by surprise, accept Jesus as your savior, when many people disappear and why Jesus took them, 1 Thessalonians 4:16:17 Why does the same Lord come down from heaven with a shout and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God and those who died in Christ will rise first, then after we stay alive we will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air .... Watch this video my brother is important before it's too late, God bless your life always ... Jesus is close !! among the clouds he comes  https://youtu.be/J1WhaD2eyus

Love the video, the vibe and the song!! Great Ava!!!
FI-NA-LLY a music video that shows your professionnal style, more mature, more fashion, more elevated. Damn you deserved visuals like that since ages. No more funny videos, something on the level of your talent. And the song is very retro, I love that come back. The vocals are good AF If it's a new Era, I'm jumping IN. Please follow those steps, it suits you so well and that new orange wig, i'm living for it ! WELCOME BACK AVA
Polska pozdrawia mega piosenka
This is 5th Element film's aesthetic copy & paste. That bar code underwear is just strange though......not exactly great is it? Making yourself out to be product.
I just love this girl!
Dope 💪🌺✌🏻

i love it this songs🥰...from Mizoram India
[Lyrics] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain. But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed. Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real. If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars. But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed. Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real. If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you. Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
Just 😱😱😱😱 Ava 🖤🖤
No se pero me recuerda lady Gaga, pero con otra voz.
🤑💗💖💕💋💋💋
Your new album is amazing like you ♥ I'm enjoying it so much
Leeloo from Fifth element anyone ? 💗
Her best song ... and this 5th element vibe is amazing!!!
leelou dallas multipass
This song manages to look like it's from the early 2000's and futuristic at the same time. Such a banger.
Her voice never disappoints.
Why Are You Naked
The hair alone is enough to invoke the Fifth Element inspiration, even without the iconic white strips!
without high heels she's more better ❤️
Lady Gaga clone
Yay 31 on trending. Well done Ava
Come on Lilu Dallas Multipass realness!
this is so trash
We àll miss her blonde hair 😭😭
El quinto elemento 😅
Ava eh linda, talentosa. Essa mulher não erra em suas músicas. Amei o álbum e cada música. Sem saber que iria lançar clipe, já amei essa música. Agora com clipe....linda. Kisses from Brazil.

The Beauty with The Brain and The Voice - Ava Max❤️
Jak zawsze super piosenka. Pozdrawiam❤ Śliczny teledysk,I wogóle cał jesteś piękna
Wow! This song has such a deep meaning to it. The value of trust is really emphasised here. I love how Ava Max has used ‘Naked’ to metaphorically portray a subject so powerful.
Ava Max deserves more than everything, she is a sweet little angel and her songs are bop 💕
Milla Jovovich on The Fifth Element vibes
I love the nostalgia vibe here! Ava Max bringing me back to good old times.
There is nothing on the face of this Earth that I would not do be the one that she allowed to see inside of her heart

She is amazing ❤❤👏👏💖
I haven't even listened to the whole song and l already love it😘😘l love you Ava😘😘😘
👁👄👁
This song is NOT about sex like so many other songs these days are. It’s literally about being vulnerable to the one you love. The line “tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul” clearly outlines that meaning and is strengthened by the bridge. We have a Queen on the throne.
5th element vide?
La amo muchoo
Wow
I Love u Ava ❤️❤️❤️🎶💥
Her hair reminds me of a girl cast on Netflix film " Son of Adam "
Very 5th element 😍
All of her songs are just so fun, none are boring. I love this one. It’s explaining how love is more than just sex, how it’s about listening and connecting with your partner.
Bebe rexa still looks better

This is better than a song with the same title 🔥
Omg this is so Incredible

I'm so excited for this album
This is awsome, but I think there's an awesome Country version still to come ...
"Naked".
Cara isso tá maravilhoso
This Is A Great Music Video and I Love You So Much Ava Max
LITTLE MONTERS APOYANDO A AVA MAX. POR FAVOR LES PIDO QUE VISITEN  CUANDO LADY GAGA LANCE EL VIDEO DE 911
The only thing that made me uncomfy in this video are those eyelashes like Yas queen get it but maybe trim them eyelashes bb 😭✨
All that skin and all I am looking out is the red hair. I liked hero normal color of white to blond.
This is literally quite clever cause everyone who searches "Ava Max naked" will get to this song😂
Incrível como essa mulher nunca erra Mano, que perfeição de álbum e que perfeição de clipe 💖
Yassss go ava 🦋🦋
O ÁLBUM PERFEITO EXISTE 💖
Ummm naked in the morning. Opsss!!

I love this song and nice to see Ava with a bit less make-up.
Gives me hard Lady Gaga vibes... especially in 1:34 like damm
0:46 that beats product placement tho, did anybody else notice?

Holy Battle   I'm in a Holy Battle against corruption. The Governmental Systemic Corruption in Brazil is worse than COVID-19. I don't like living in Brazil. It's a good place with very bad and fake people.   Estou em uma batalha sagrada contra a corrupção. A Corrupção Sistêmica Governamental no Brasil é pior do que a COVID-19.

Another bop from Bonnie McKee
Me: *walks to a therapist singing this song* Therapist: whats wrong? Me: im listening to ava max so nothing is wrong
Jonas 4 ''O descontentamento de Jonas e a resposta do Senhor      1 MAS desgostou-se Jonas extremamente disso, e ficou todo ressentido.  2 E orou ao Senhor, e disse: Ah! Senhor! não foi isso o que eu disse, estando ainda na minha terra? por isso me preveni, fugindo para Tarsis, pois sabia que és Deus piedoso,<1> e misericordioso, longânimo e grande em benignidade, e que te arrependes do mal.  <1> 4.2 Êx 34.6 3 Peço-te, pois, ó Senhor, tira-me a minha vida, porque melhor me é morrer do que viver.  4 E disse o Senhor: É razoável esse teu ressentimento?  5 Então Jonas saiu da cidade, e assentou-se ao oriente da cidade: e ali fez uma cabana, e se assentou debaixo dela, à sombra, até ver o que aconteceria à cidade.  6 E fez o Senhor Deus nascer uma aboboreira, que subiu por cima de Jonas, para que fizesse sombra sobre a sua cabeça, a fim de o livrar do seu enfado: e Jonas se alegrou em extremo por causa da aboboreira.  7 Mas Deus enviou um bicho, no dia seguinte ao subir da alva, o qual feriu a aboboreira, e esta se secou.  8 E aconteceu que, aparecendo o sol, Deus mandou um vento calmoso, oriental, e o sol feriu a cabeça de Jonas; e ele desmaiou, e desejou com toda a sua alma morrer, dizendo: Melhor me é morrer do que viver.  9 Então disse Deus a Jonas: É acaso razoável que assim te enfades por causa da aboboreira? E ele disse: É justo que me enfade a ponto de desejar a morte.  10 E disse o Senhor: Tiveste compaixão da aboboreira, na qual não trabalhaste, nem a fizeste crescer; que numa noite nasceu, e numa noite pereceu;  11 E não hei de eu ter compaixão da grande cidade de Nínive em que estão mais de cento e vinte mil homens, que não sabem discernir entre a sua mão direita e a sua mão esquerda, e também muitos animais?''  {Fonte:SociedadeBíblicadoBrasil.Bíblia Sagrada-AlmeidaRevista eCorrigida1969.Sociedade Bíblica do Brasil.KindleEdition}.

Sono lunica Italiana che adora Ava Max
Video starts off good then turns into craziness, woukdve done a few things different. But the lyrics and music are solid. Really felt it
Maravilhosa 😍😍 essa é minha música favorita do Heaven & hell ainda bem que ganhou um clipe. Naked é meu amorzinho 😍😍 Lembra muito o Pop da década passada por isso que gosto tanto dessa música
I like it a lot.
collab with BTS

She always got beats lol
This somehow reminds me of Fifth Element a lot
I LOVE IT

Wow - nice hair colour. And I'm still so excited get your crazy moment.
hello ava max
I searched Ava Max naked before it was cool
You look so hot🔥🔥🔥👙👙
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
One of the few singers whose almost every song I fall in love with at the first listen. I'm glad someone's doing real pop these days.. This one has 90s vibes.. Donna Lewis etc.
if this song will not be in billboard charts and her album in billboard album charts i'm gonna be mad af.
Ale gówno
Her voice not only pleases me ears, but also warms my heart.
These are some fifth Element Outfits i like it its a good movie
awesome 🔥
Ava really just cut off one side of her hair and said to the other pop girls “here hold my weave, I’m bout to show y’all what real pop music is”  I can’t wait for her to come to Ireland on tour. I’m gonna he front row singing every word and dancing like the world is about to end.
I hope no one looks at my YouTube search history as now it's got "naked ava max" and "ava max naked" in it. 😂😂 My only saving grace is I am gay so😂😂💁‍♂️🙆‍♂️
Queen Ava 😘😘
Yes queen ✨💖I love it ✨💖
I LOVE YOU QUEEN😍😍😍

I AM SO READY
THE POP MUSIC SUPREME IS HERE BOW DOWN
Here are the lyrics! (i got them off genius lyrics)  [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
Meh

Im here for 1M VIEWWWSSS!!!!
Adoreiiiiii
Incrível
Fantastica 😍
Ava MAX can I scan your bar code
NAKED is not a song about sex as we may have thought because of the title, it's a metaphor for showing your true self to someone you love; and surrendering yourself to him/her as the bridge of the song says.
This song takes me back in 2010's songs. the beat is so sweet😍.
You are : awesome 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
Amazing😭💕
First ever song of Ava Max I don't like

i lov"e soundtracks💖💖💖
she looks SOO beautiful in the first look with no lashes and natural makeup!! wow, so different and so cute

"People say Ava Max only has fans"    Comment if you are an Air Conditioner
Gurl The wait was worthy
Let's stream harder avatars
I don't know why but she is looking so similar to Shakira😍😍🔥
OMG.!!!Ava you are amazing for me 😍❤💓
I remember when I discovered her randomly for the first time. She put Sweet But Psycho's lyric video out but it wasn't that known for a while. Then she put out the music video for it, and it began to blow up slowly, more and more each day and she quickly gained more recognition, recognition that she deserves because she definitely has so much talent, and even though I think she deserves even more recognition, I'm so happy she has been growing so much. THIS ALBUM IS ON FIIIIIIRE.
Cheap copy of gaga
Lets dance 😍
I really like this song , love your music keep going Ava Max 🔥🔥 Also guys wanna check my music in my channel , you know if you want 😂

Was looking for the lyrics man but I didn’t find it, so I’ll be me:  LYRICS  [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it, yeah (Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

Can we all just agree that Ava Max is the greatest popstar of our current generation? I don’t get a weird feeling when I watch her music videos. I don’t feel like there’s an agenda behind it. It doesn’t feel toxic and evil like everything else. There’s a sense of purity. A sense of compassion behind the artistry. She is the real deal! We are blessed to have an artist of her caliber during these times. I can’t wait for the world to go back to normal so we can start going to her concerts and Vibing to her live performances. Amazing new album!!! ⚡️
ARCHAIIIIIIIIIIIII🌞💜🌞💜🌞💜🌞💜🌞💜🌞💜🌞

THIS IS SO GOOD AVA
So I'm listening to this album and I gotta say that she is so professional. Can't believe it's her debut album.   Every song is a bop.  Btw I did acover of "SWEET BUT PSYCHO" ch3ckit
Lyrics [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say the trouble was my name I’ve been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I’m like Heaven, take the good Lord’s name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don’t know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you’ll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don’t know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to, you  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don’t know my heart You’re never gonna break it (Oh) Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real
Cool 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍  Wow ur song 😍😍😍😍😍

Ava Max  NAKED LYRICS  [Verse 1] Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame Ask me why they used to say the trouble was my name I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Verse 2] If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars  [Pre-Chorus] But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest Never fall in love, everybody loses the bet But underneath, I just need to forget So come and get me undressed  [Chorus] Well, you can take off all my clothes And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You’re never gonna break it Baby Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I'm ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real  [Bridge] If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you Lay my head on your chest and just surrender Just surrender to, you And never see me naked See me for real If you don't know my heart You're never gonna break it (Oh) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul I wanna show you my deepest secrets I think I’m ready to be exposed I want you watching me When you can take off all my clothes And really see me naked See me for real

Brazil loves you Ava 💖😍
me encanta su musica y ella como producto, me encanta la producción de su musica y los videos se nota que estan muy inspirados en la musica noventera, es la tipica diva pop, pero que no tiene nada que ver con la musica basura del 2020, por eso me gusta. PD: me hace acordar a shakira con el pelo rojo

Wth. Why are there dislikes when they haven’t even heard the song yet?!
I just found out that Ava fans are called Avatars! Is that an amazing name for a fandom?
Who else thinks that an Ava and Dua collab would be revolutionary?
Very goot
I literally can’t wait! She’s my favorite artist and in my opinion the future of pop!
Oop finally here before a premiere-  I’m so happy and excited
Make this blue if you've been an avatar before Heaven and Hell.     I'M SO PROUD OF AVA

Ava, if you ever see this, I love what you do, you make the best songs ever! They really help me get back up and feel great even when I’m down! Your songs really are amazing and you deserve everything! My bday is coming up in like a week and I am asking for your album and I really hope I get it! Tysm for everything you do! I know you will continue to be amazing! Love you Ava! <3<3<3<3<3
