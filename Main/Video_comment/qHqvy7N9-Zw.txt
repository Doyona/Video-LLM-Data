Hopefully glazers leave because according to reports  thinking to stay  because were winning again however there cursed for us i don't what us to lose again and they get rich off us losing and club braking
You mean just like newcastle united media coverage ffs
British media has been terribly biased in many areas including sports coverage for a long time.
The fact of the matter is that United does not need super wealth if it is run properly, however, why drive a fast streetcar when you can drive an F1 car? The Qataris will run it the way it should be run.
People winging about Qatar then backing 'Hedge Fund' finance. So what makes Hedge funds more moral then,
Media bias? Qatar should not be allowed to buy any franchise. We all know why but no one wants to say it, or people want to pretend that because our governments are far from perfect there is a moral equivalency to be had, which is complete and utter naive nonsense. No way Qatar or any of their wealthy individuals or conglomerates can buy this club. It's bad enough a family of gluttons own us already.
No one in their right mind would want qatar to own Man U, the soul of football has been sold for the last 25 years and this would be the last of it gone.
Not necessarily a disagreement with Mark - but there is a clear distinction between: Not wanting Qatar vs. Not wanting Qatar and wanting Sir Jim.   I feel as though many are opposed to Qatar due to morals or fears over how they'd run the club. But that doesn't mean they automatically want Sir Jim without knowing his plans for the club.
Mark used to say that the debt will leave with the Glazers.
Glazers took the FC off United’s badge,they take dividends each year when no other club does and they lead the super league,Americans have done more to destroy our club and the premier league than the Qataris . Qatar owned psg stood strong against the super league. We all watched the wc,some bank at Barclays, work in the shard,shop at Sainsbury’s and harrods.
100% there is a news reporter that works for independence talking mad crap & yet the buness he works for they own 30% of the business. 🤣
If de gea was English he would be the best GK the world has ever seen
Media push Brexit view of ‘Qatar bid’. It’s an individual FROM Qatar, we can assume he’s linked to state but don’t actually know. Not the same media bias against Radcliffe or American consortiums. Media don’t say enough about ineos or Americans,if sheik wins he will be pressured or may even agree with huge support for women,lgbtq and human rights that he couldn’t support in Qatar. ‘Green washing’ is also an issue and we know Americans would push for super league any time it comes around
If its Qatar we absolutely must buy Bellingham!
Glazers in Glazers out Glazers all about 🎶
The glazers delivered ten Haag Mark,ever want to thank them?
I feel Thursday nights game will be weghorsts night 🙏
Mark has been totally sport washed
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE GABBY AND PIERS IN A INTERVIEW!!! 🤣🤣🤣 best comment by far,  i feel the same mark
Glazers aren't going anywhere
90% of people who want Radcliffe would switch if the Qatari bid was a Manchester bid. I want the best deal for United I couldn’t care less where it comes from
Hope it doesn't come back in 10 years and bite us on the ass just like the city owners. But people seem to forget Newcastle faced the same scrutiny.
I mean it is kinda obvious he wants qatar lol
Totally agree with ye mark glad ur feeling better
It is important not to confuse issues. The World Cup allocation to Quatar is not relevant to the bids for United.
Happy birthday Mr Phil Jones. Rumour has it he got himself a new pair of rainbow boots to hang up lol
Very interesting comments about the bids for United.
For purely footballing reasons it has to be Qatar. They will look after the club and take us forward and that's all we can ask for.
Like I said, people  are just blind and don't think or  see for them self what they see on the TV they take in and believe  America have beef with China, but they still do deals  to benefit to full there pockets open Your eyes. Stop the hate, stop the hate. GLAZORS OUT SUPPORT THE TEAM AND TENHAG  everyone COME TOGETHER AS ONE GLAZORS Vipers  GLAZORS OUT.
you saying Wout Weghorst should be here is why you are a shitty person.He's an alternative that worked out well...
Canary Wharf is owned by either Qatar or Kuwait lol as is most of London. Shard is owned by Qatar isn’t it?
In the normal world, only a fool puts himself in debt
Saw a comment in the live section saying that poch is better then ten hag. wtf??? 🤣
Man Qatar united a former Football Club. What a shame.
Mark only yestetday i said to myself I am looking forward to seeing our home grown players come through. Kobe Mainoo is exactly what we need. That profile...age of player
My take on this is simple. Those Utd detractors see exactly what potentially the Qatari investors can do 4 us. I am all 4 the Qatari investment
the group that bought Newcastle United! tried to buy man United 6 months earlier with the same people but the premier league stopped it ! United bias??
Am very worried.  The club has just appointed a new member of staff - why, if the owners are selling up? After showing hides like alligators for seventeen years, the Glazers are suddenly so easily offended - by the truth of course, but that's another discussion. They've shrugged off insults, protests and open criticism from former players without a word. Why so easily offended now?  And they've increased ticket prices by 5%. None of this represents actions of owners who intend to sell up.  Yes, Baldy Ponytail has been practically living in Qatar but that's not necessarily to do with this bid. That could have been to do with the minority investments that the Qataris previously seemed interested in.  I am very worried that we are gonna be partitioned up by the Glazers and another group of snakes like Poland by the Nazis and Soviets...
Whether you support or moan and groan about a Qatari bid or them buying united.... There will be no skin off your nose. These so called fans just want something to moan about.
I wish Sir Alex was rich enough to buy United. But seriously, I am with Sir Jim. Less baggage.
Well, I want to see Mase back..  Edit: Bruno is the "ENGINE" of the team..
The media is so scared that United might dominate again that they are doing wht they can to stop the Qataris from taking over 😂 City already fits all their anti Qatari bids and they still twerk for City when they win the league
Give us Qatar
You after a new sponsor or to retire?
I honestly do not feel the glazers are going sadly. Glazers out
Bro where was this energy when Newcastle got taken over and man city🤦🏿
weghorst is a work horse  he covers lots of ground defensively that frees up the other attacking players to run into space
My face is oily today. Let’s go Qatar.
There is enough media criticism of this. Its rather tame compared to what the Saudis / Newcastle got.
They aren't even focused on the employment created in that area of Manchester if Qatar buys utd ..
Anyone who lives outside western countries knows how biased the western media. So we are not surprised that even when it comes to football, they have a certain point of view. Look, there is no perfect prospective owner, not even an ideal one. At least for me among them the best option is Qatar.
Yeah mark the memory's are for life I don't care who owns us don't care who runs the club manchester united has always been for us fans of the club
come on qatar, we need camavinga and vinicius
If i may speak with 💯 honestly regarding z1onist media, without youtube(itself z1on1st owned)  Any opportunity to make anything Islamic look bad is snapped up ny z1o media. Zio funded uk government labor or torie, do the samw thing.  Now as if this factual comment would stay up long enough to even think about discussing Manchester Uniteds masonic heritage.
I'v Never Seen a controversial football club ownership as United ownership even when thé chinese company owned intermilan
Qatar deal is done ✅💯🤝💪😎🤩
lots of people here wanted Conte hummm
I am confident that the Qataris will have the edge over the Jims. I also believed they are not going lord any player over the coach.What the coach want is what they bring.
why are you guys hung up on telling the owners that the must sell a club they own it like me telling you to sell your car
Mark,  if you have any morals you will speak up against this Qatari takeover.
My dream Signing for the summer   Osimhen, Mitoma, Son and Caicedo Bellingham. Fk De Jong he didn’t want us  when we were in dirt and we don’t want him when things are looking good!
I don't want Sir Jim and his American, criminal, scumbag banking pals. Worse than the Qatari bid IMO.
MC, we dont condone LGBTQ but we are quiet and respectful to them.. i don't understand why people should slug off Qatar in what they believe in...people should be respected for what they consider it is right for them. As for us we believe in the success of man utd and that is all that matters
I will stop following united if the Qatar take over happens
I want Qatar..
I want Qatar
how to say you wan't QATARI OWNERS without saying you want qatari owners by Mr ''Mark Goldbridge''
I cant get excited after yesterday. I now feel the Glazers are playing us and the financial market. Feel sick to my stomach.
i feel Qatar
only the qataris will be able to raise Man Utd to the level it was in every ange, and all these without any Debts unlike the greedy Glazers
What’s worrying me is the increase in ticket prices and the removal of some boxes for more seats and a couple other things why are they all of sudden approving changes in stuff right before they leave if they arent
You were a tea boy
They dont want qatar because theyr brown.
I feel QATARI
The Glazers aren't leaving and we're chasing Kane in the summer.
Your so wrong mark there selling 30% stake in the club
Maaaaan the Qatar World Cup have showed how hypocrites and double standards the west is
Am going to break it before everyone else does congratulations manchester United bid has been accepted and will soon be owned by quatar... Anyone who don't belive me... Learn Arabic and go and watch the video from representative of the new owner..  100k stadium is coming to old Trafford..   Congratulations guys 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Cracks me up how everyone acts as if ETH came up with the Bruno on the RW as his idea but at Sporting he played there regularly. HAHAHA.
Corrupt quatari would destroy us , Shameless !
Why am I getting the feeling more and more that SJR is just a Glazer with a British accent?
As a Muslim and a supporter, I find some of the comments on Syeikh are racists.
Mark you might want OT renovating…but the majority want a new stadium  - it would be cheaper in the long run as well ….
Except it's mostly utd fans bringing it up
GLAZERS OUT !!!
Reasons don't wash? Well sorry but I didn't want Newcastle, chelsea or city bought and I still don't want it for us. Just because my neighbor starts selling drugs and buys a nice car doesn't mean I have to. I'd rather not have the overdoses on my mind.
The media does not want Man United to be big again, they thrive on our failures and take pleasure in it. Imagine a Reds team that was back on top and dominating the premier league, who would be their whipping boy if they could not criticize our club?
Toady I feel Qatari
People just don't want to see man united back at the very top.
Sportwashingfc
Bruno also played more games in the world cup than Rashford, machine for real
Spent some time thinking about this lately. I'm not happy that it seems likely that Qatar will gain control over United to use as a sportswashing tool. Let's be honest, that is why they're doing it. Still, that is the world we live in. What matters to me is that United doesn't change under Qatari influence on the points that are problematic: human rights, LHGBT+, freedom of speech. And I don't think it will. I don't think the fans will let it, I don't think the FA will let it, and to be honest I don't think the new owners will want to as that would weaken the global brand that United is.  In fact, United is so massive, I think it may very well be a double edged sword in the culture and PR wars: values and attitudes will go the other way as well, and may very well end up having a positive influence in Qatari society. Naive, perhaps, but enough for me to accept reality and keep supporting the club.  And I must say: a debt free and financially backed United is incredibly exciting. So let's wait and see.
Glazer's out Glazer's out
Today I feel Qatari
It's really disappointing to see how the majority of this fanbase seems to have had its head turned by the Qataris. It's got nothing to do with other clubs already going down that road. MUFC has the chance to maintain its integrity and not follow the current trend sheep style.
Qatar will give you full expertise in every field.
Amazing
the debt has to go whoever buys us. The good thing about United is it can wash its own face not having to service the debt and someone take profits will help immensely. The new owners can support the manager and concentrate on the clubs infrastructure.
How disrespectful!!! Wout Weghorst has contributed more to this team in a couple of months compared to McTominay who has been here for years and has played week in week out!!!
ITS ALWAYS JEALOUSY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SELL OF MANCHESTER UNITED? NOBODY WHAT'S MAN UNITED TO BE GREAT AGAIN BUT ITS ALRIGHT FOR CITY CHELSEA NEWCASTLE TO HAVE MEGGER FINANCIAL POWER BUT MANCHESTER UNITED NO. IN 7 MONTHS TIME SPURS  OR LIVERPOOL GET QATAR 🇶🇦 OWNERS UNITED WOULD OF MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE AND WILL NEVER RECOVER....WHAT IF EVERYBODY WILL SAY. FOOTBALL IS CHANGING AND THIS IS THE BLUE PRINT WITH A TOP MANAGER 🤦🏿‍♂️⚽️
You know what we do know about sir Jim? He doesn't have slaves
Love Sir Jim but it looks like a 17 year ago take over in his bid
If someone offered 150mill for rashford would you take it???
If the glazers stay with radcliff etc.. there should huge protests to stop this
Information is the key
i HATE THIS GUY ON THIS SHOW TODAY
Whats the issue with a dictator state owning our club? Anyone?
Others are going to look silly later? lol, .. You and so many others wanted AWB Lindelof Rashford etc etc sold 4  or 5 months ago. How can you say such things when you are so guilty of it yourself?
Yeah Rashford may be player of the year. but United is Team of the Year
The last time United got bid for by Sky the papers and regulators didnt like that either and we ended up with a leveraged buyout and the Glazers rinsing our club for nearly 20 years. United went from debt free self-sustaining successful football club to a joke thats been drained of its wealth and laughed at by other clubs.
Who ever buys United the priority is to buy class players to attract big sponsors
Hope this does not offend anyone but regarding Qatar human rights issues, there is an argument to make that the more Qatar integrates with the west, the more they have to conform to the west's sensibilities. Therefore Qatar ownership of Man Utd would  be a pro for human rights. The same could be said of Liv golf
The biggest irony is the english complaining about the human rights 😂😂😂😂😂😂 ffs you hypocrite twats
I get the feeling that Sir Jim wants to do exactly the same as the Glazers did but on a bigger scale
Super wealth is a terrible idea. Sustainable rich owner who cares about the club is what I prefer. Qatar feels like a terrible option, looking at just how awfully they've run PSG. Sir Jim has been ok at Nice and could prove valuable for United's longer term future.
is amazing
Sad to say it glazers ain’t gone sell cuz we’re doing good
It’s not just football and sports, there are more activists in the media now than actual news reporters right across the board.
the only thing I want is Glazers GONE n have nothing to do with the Club ANYMORE!! Clean Break!!! Otherwise they are just screwing the fans all over again!!!
I really wish Apple are willing to buy United
good article.... i'm Qatar In all the way
We all know you want oiled up Mark 👏🤣 don’t need to try and hide it 🤣🤣🤣
A mixture of youth and old heads is always the way to go.. that way the young players become the experienced players for the next young players to come in… perfect cycle
So what happened about FFP stopping United investing in the team in the summer regardless of who owns the club ?
You worked in finance for 15 years, was a police officer for 20 years which (do the maths) totals 35. You are 44 this year which makes you 9 when you started work.  That is without adding in your football career. What is that smell???? Oh its the smell of b*llshIt. I cant believe people pay your wages to listen to this.
@MiguelDelaney lol
How would anti-Qatar-bid fans look like hypocrites next year if they do buy us, and the club does well? 95% of us don’t want the Glazers to own the club, but we’re still passionately supporting the team this year. Come on Mark.
🔰 GLAZERS OUT 🔰
Impossible to get excited because deep down I know they’re staying
Possible RED FLAGS! - Avram Glazer looking to buy out shares from  his siblings  - Hedge funds backing them - Glazers wanting to keep the sale a secret
Propaganda !!!!!! That's what you call it
25yr old Frenkie and 24yr old Osihmen are the perfect ages for our team
Think they know who they want this exploring orther bids is to show people they may have a chance, it’s like giving someone a job an still advertising it.
If we get bought by Sir Jim/Ineos we will be a plastic club! I don't really want to be an oil club either but we really have no choice.
Also we don't want Old Trafford renaming the Qatar stadium either.
Qatar is the only option here, period!!
Those shouting get Pouch are the enemies of Man United. They have been taken aback by ETH success. Poch can't even deal with Ronaldo if he has been the one on the wheel.
My huge concern is that if Qatar don’t purchase United they then purchase Liverpool, that would be a disaster.
Qatar or we riot 🤬
biggest lie that he worked for an investment bank.. maybe as a clerk
Sir Jim is based in Monaco now for tax purposes. Surely that would cost him some of the ‘local’ appeal
I love your channel. You are a big inspiration to me. ❤❤❤
As a season ticket holder and been informed the cost for next season is being increased, could this be a sign that the Glazers are some how staying?
Nobody buys Mark’s claim that he doesn’t know what he wants, right?
45:25 this is straight facts
these journos crying about morals of football (they celebrated city and Newcastle being bought) are just using that to hide they're real anger which is Qatar buying united means the club will be dominating again..its their worst nightmare. they have no integrity and couldn't care less about human rights or sports washing
Is it possible that they want prospective bidders to keep quiet about details in case it affects the share price? GGMU! LUHG!
The Media Wanted Pochetino .  Manchester United fans Wanted Ten Hag. The Media wants Glazer 2.0 (Ratcliffe) Manchester United fans wants Jassim.
Mark is clearly biased towards Qatar
Media is incredibly unfair towards the Qataris, No to INEOS
At this point the Qatari bashing is nothing but xenophobia
Imagine if sir Jim was a foreigner with such a bid?
We want Qatari oil and gas, no more ineos things
Talk of David De Gea contract please😵😵.  Or is the Club just gonna let him leave despite his positive attitude towards his contact renewal??  Not another Andre Herrera situation please🙏🙏
I think they should build one of those temporary stadium like it was at the world cup. Then old Trafford get a complete renovation from top to bottom.
Let's finish this season strong.  Let's support our boys.  Next season gonna be exciting❣️
Why are you Englishers calling Qatar immmoral for not allowing people indentify as penguins?
Can't wait for barca what a season we are having great job Eric and Co. GGMU
If the Qatari retracted his bid and tabled an offer for, say, Spurs, all media scrutiny would cease immediately. Shameless.
Qatar should buy Real Madrid not a DEAD club like United 😂😂😂
Oil me up
Let the oil spill all over old Trafford
Sell ,Fred and Jones and Mctom ,that should raise abot £20 .lol
Qatari
No one who cares about anything listens to the media anyway. As long as whoever buys the club invests, and supports ETH, I'm in (that includes Qatar ownership)
Today I feel Qatari 🇶🇦
