I thought you don’t lose adrenaline unless the defense bumps you so how he losing adrenaline without being bumped or did they change that?

Nice start bro. The shooting take is fiiire
Y’all make sure y’all make your own build this year these content creators making bs builds! You need defense for sure. Ofc look what they do but don’t copy and paste like y’all been doing for years. Be your own person this year
😂 this vid was lit you just made me hype to play 2k again. You had me ctfu when you bought 750k vc.

Mike wang said the walk back will be back
Look Mid if im being honest
700k VC to get to 85?
W
Buying 700k vc and then saying I'll do a no money spent later is literally contradicting the point of no money spent...gotta get the likes though right?
jump shot?
Jump shot ?
YOO DOUBLEH im the guy you added thanks for adding me
green animations taking so long to activate suck's i much preferer the 23  version
is zens still allowed?
You know I was waiting for this video 🔥🔥
can u make a video of this build pls
Drop the jumper
3 min gang 👇
What’s the jumpshot
do i buy vc when doing the NZ trick? or do i wait
I was thinking about making a build with an 88-89 3pter but you’re making me question my choices
definitely dont go on your xbox, dont switch location to new zeland, and dont restart your xbox, but if you do definitely dont start up 2k24😉
You’re HIM 💪🏽
Nah double h is just different. There are people with high 3pter and ball handles who are boxed
Nice build
WE HERE❤
