1 year later the impact this ppv had on the wrestling world at the time makes it seem all the more crazy; in every sense of the word. The shoot media scrum from CM Punk, to MJF being AEWs equivalent of “Mr. Money in the Bank”, and unfortunately the concussion Adam Cole just recently sustained. I wish the best for their careers, AEW as a whole, but most importantly healthy and safe wrestling with as little injuries as possible. Witnessed too many this year.
12+456 isnt 477 Tho. But godammit your excitement is great.
My two favorite matches from this PPV were the steel cage match and Jericho vs MJF
love the shredder t shirt
Simon my dude from across the pond great video you are cracking me up 💂‍♂️😂🤣🤌
The editor sucks at adding 12 to 456 .
Simon's reaction to the tag team championship match made the video for me
That was 455 Golden ups that were added
Tony Khan's opinions & willingness to push black people since AEW started   Brown Down
LMAOOOO big show n QT got an up😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 what a fn mark
Chemcounter
😊😊😊A perfect ratings system!🤗🤗🤗
AEW is sooooo much better than WWE now
People are comparing All Out to Wrestlemania 17. What's amazing about that is that AEW is only two years old. There going to get better, and more likely sooner than later, they are going to surpass this!
AEW All Out 2021 is hands down the greatest wrestling PPV OF ALL TIME!!!
is no one gonna mention that he said add 466 to 12 which equals 478 not 477?
I watched it last night and today just feels non existent knowing I won’t be watching it again
Kojima is just built different r truth
Why is Johnny Sins talking about wrestling? Thought he used to do different type of "wrestling"
the best thing about AEW to WWE, there are lots of new faces i never heard of and being given a boost by veterans, then there's WWE where theyre reusing veterans and using the young fresh talents as cannon fodder
2:22 - Simon, what’s a “joggernot”?
ok do not need to see this vid  as i seen the ppv   and like  all the aew shows  and ppv  this one was   best  wrestling     all   aew show  need to see  all the ppvs
Goodbye wwe and thanks for all the great memories. But aew is taking the business over now.
The ending was 1000% the best ending of a wrestling PPV in history.
Kenny Omega proved why he is the #1 wrestler in the universe.
I loved this review
Totally agree with 477-0
"five point 7 stars..." you don't know how right you were gonna be
Since When did 12 + 456 = 477? Or is Simon just using the wwe style of calculating?
That is some seriously good fantasy booking by Mr. Simon but this really never happened, did it?   Did it??
Thank You Tony Khan! ❤❤❤
Simon, I too had something similar, but markedly worse than what actually happened written in my fantasy book. I have also seen footage. I do believe this actually happened.
I fell off watching pro wrestling years ago, but Punk was always one of my favorites and him coming back got me to check back in. I don't think I'll be checking out again for a while. AEW is in such a good place right now.
Wrestlemania X7 is a sideshow act compared to this...
Only bad match was the big show match
I lowkey wanted Thunder Rosa to win
12+456 = 477??
Not just ALL OUT, but this was bALLs OUT!
They definitely went ALL OUT on this one, this might be one of the best ppvs ever.
Plot twist: Punk sitting up like that was a hint to Mean Mark Calaway being All Elite 😉
The Tag team cage match was off the f'n chain
How can you not love this ppv
I don’t think any show has ever got 12 ups, 3 being golden
😱😱😱😱😱😂😂😂😂😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Haven’t watched pro wrestling since I was 12. I’m 21 now. I’ve watched some matches from AEW here and there since they launched. And every time I’d get a little spark reminding me of why I was a fan before but never fully got into it. This ppv not only lit the fire to get me back into wrestling. It pretty much blew me up. I don’t watch wwe anymore cuz it seems too meh. But damn AEW is doing it right. For the first time ever I feel like wwe is actually in trouble.
That shirt is mad small
No wonder Triple H ended up in the Hospital...😁
Simon, none of this actually happened, was this in some weird fantasy book that you wrote?
Only complaint is Daniel Bryan's debut completely overshadowed Adam Cole's.....9/10 one the best in last 20years for sure!
Is it just me or were the Young Bucks going for a Hulk Hogan (not a lion!) & Macho Man look?
Definitely one of the best PPVs of all time, arguably THE best imo. Top to bottom they nailed it. Heatwave '98 is hard to top for me but dammit, this show had everything.
AEW is now destroying WWE.
He ain’t Daniel Bryan anymore , he is the American dragon Bryan Danielson.
Just such a great PPV...what tue hell happened! Oo
It gave me outsiders showing up to wcw vibes
Any relation to Jonny Sins?
If this is the best Pro Wrestling has to offer these days, I'm glad I still don't watch anymore.
I appreciate that Johnny sins enjoys wrestling as much as I do v.v
The ending segment should’ve gotten the first ever Diamond Up
LMFAO..LOVE IT..LOVE UR SHOW....I GIVE U SIR...477 GLODEN UPS.....
This video's title is wrong. There were no downs.
Not the biggest aew fan, but this PPV is top 5. Well done
havent watched wrestling regularly for years now. usually watch around 10 shows a year, the big 4 wwe shows and a couple other random ones.  was happy when aew came on the scene just cuz i thought it could only benefit the business as a whole but never really followed them. i gotta say, and its kinda sad but also exciting, this show makes me actually want to watch aew on a weekly basis, which is a feeling i havent had for an eternity now when it comes to wrestling.
*This Deserved A Golden UP!*
Crater thing popped me up 🤣
That guitarist is from his band, right?
I felt like Tony was struggling with Jim.
Moment of absurdity. People like it.
235 people are pissing me off
Half of the card was dedicated to men who got famous because of WWE, & Christian was the only one to lose their match.
This definitely feels like the downfall of WWE. It’s amazing to be excited about pro wrestling again!! Hopefully Wyatt and Steen sign with AEW and show Vince how to book 2 more main event stars!!
I'm guessing Simon is still orgasoming from All Out! Seriously Simon is about to have a heart attack or his head exploding. AEW shouldn't do any more surprises or Simon may die! This is what it is like if you let a kid eat all the candy in the candy store and lace all the candy with coke!
Orange cassidy shouting at Kris Statlander! Then excalibur saying, "Thats the most I've heard him speak!"
Totally amazing! The battle royal was insane! Every time Tony Schiavone (i think that was him!), said that a certain wrestler was favourite to win, they went over the ropes!! I'm surprised that the big names went out when they did! Especially Jade Cargil!
Nick Jackson is basically rocking Hollywood Hogan facial hair, btw. But I like the "lion" idea just as much.
Simon needs to be Aew World Champ 😁😁😁
I was there in Chicago but had to check out the ups and downs
Rey Fenix is top 5 wrestlers in the world for me 🔥🔥🔥
Great PPV but it didn't deserve a flawless rating. Paul Wight vs QT Marshall was definitely a down at the very least. The man can barely move anymore and people are having to over-sell for him. Jericho  & MJF also wasn't that great but I'll give you a pass on that one.
Miller do a live stream with the boys
the one winged angel is the most protected finisher today. so if it's hit, the match is over.
Is that Johnny sins??
2/3 of the lucha bro intrance song where unhearable.
Keep being awesome Simon Miller. Hands down the most entertaining wrestling channel because of your enthusiasm. Never change.
not one golden up but two golden ups!  hell why not three golden ups and add 456 more golden ups.. hell i lost count.  BEST PPV EVER..............!!!
What sold the Jericho x MJF ending even better was that the referee who told Aubrey about Jericho's foot on the rope only saw that because he was helping with the HaggerxWardlow braw, so it even made sense he would be there looking. Great PPV.
The Moxley match was terrible
I honestly can't watch WWE anymore! If i watch any wrestling it's aew. This is how wrestling should be run. By listening to fans and the wrestlers first
Wow! Return of CM Punk, brian danielson and wwe lost Adam Cole! The last one is 100% WWE's downfall. They should have put him on the main roster. WWE will be gone in 3 years at this rate
Even my wife loved All Out, and she doesn't even really watch wrestling. An all-time great show.
Best PPV I’ve seen from AEW. I think the Lucha Brod vs Young Bucks was the match of the year.
When you need Platinum because you're about to break the gold system
When the best ppv then makes the best ups and down 477 ups each for both  OHH doolally that was fun watch 🤣🤣😂
"I have no where near 12mil dollars."
Simon…you need to seek help. Your enthusiasm is killing you 😆
Kenny plays such a good heel
Tony Kahn: Fire Everything
My only complaint of the ppv was the first two matches with miro and John moxley- some of the selling was garbage. Especially with Eddie Kingston. The tag match was one of the best matches I've seen. Ever.
It’s kinda suspicious that Simon didn’t give any downs to AEW All In
some would say they went all out for that ppv
MJF should have won. I love Jericho, but I wanted the reign to end. MJF has to be the guy to end it!
Easily one of the best Ppvs of all Time
So glad Danielson still had Ride of the Valkeries as his entrance music.
Absolutely amazing PPV every match was amazing. Even the Big Show match was good
CM Punk match was a tribute to Bret Hart vs 123 Kid match
All these arrivals may not be a good thing. I think Mox is going to be odd man out soon. Jericho as well. Punk, Omega, Cole, Danielson are taking up a lot of oxygen. Hell, Christian is! There is a  clear divide between the level of stars. Punk played up Darby but no, he's a step over jungle boy. But he's not anywhere near that level. Oh damn, I forgot Mero, Black and Cody!  What do you do with Page? Hes really a Malachi Black level. But I think Starks, Cage (The big one),  Cassidy, FTR, Orange, Pac, Sammy and even MJF, are all going to suffer with these guys taking up space. Especially with the two shows not having their own exclusive talent.
That's so awesome aew broke the show
Golden UP to Lana's Tweet to Miro after the match LOL
22:00 BAY BAY
you should make a whole video on the repoman! i am a fan too!
This PPV was pure fan fiction 😆
That was Jericho lead guitarist from fozzy
I looked it up and that is the hardest part of the ring.  Hilarious! That has quickly become such an overused comment by announcers.
Simon swole as hell.
It was a great ppv but if I was a signed AEW talent I would be a little pissed that i had to job to these big EX WWE superstars. After grinding for over a year. Esspecily the Ladies in the rumble style match that the winner ends up being an EX WWE superstar.
Feels like 98-99 all over again! But this time AEW is the WWF and the WWE is WCW
Please add subtitles this guy sounds like gibberish
Looks like everybody in wrestling is gay now,now I understand why they like to pick each other up by the balls and crotch and slam Each other.
This ppv left me with happy tears...
I'm just so happy to see the legendary  *Minoru Suzuki* back in action.  *That guy alone can literally wipe out an entire roster.*
That was a member of Fozzy who played Jerichos entrance.
Weather u support WWE or AEW but  do watch this pay per view just once i bet u will not regret it
I just dont understand why they didnt put the team taz angle in there smh. Would’ve preferred that or a ricky starks promo rather than the big show match
A.E. Dub
D.M.D!!!!
Technical Workrate Productions youtube channel is 100x better than this channel. Fact.
That Cage match tho... the emotions at the end... ugh... so good
The crazy part is it’s not even hyperbole to say AEW can almost do nothing wrong. Not everything they do is 100%, but damn they try so hard and obviously have an amazing backstage scene to put on shows like this.
UPS AND DOWNS? THERE WERE NO DOWNS IN AEW ALL OUT LOL
Anyone ever notice if you play Simon's videos at .5 or .25 speed it's really REALLY funny?
This was the best PPV Since Wrestlemania 17. That’s absolutely crazy…
I was hysterical and in tears throughout the whole PPV and now I am all over again listening to Simon relive it all too. I am with you, what the hell kind of wrestling dream is this? I think my head may explode.  PS: Kevin Steen(Owens) tweeting about Mt Rush more has me saying please give me more of the drugs!!!!
People should of known Adam Cole was gonna join the Elite, he walked out from the heel entrance
When Ruby Soho looked at the ref in disbelief that she when and then gave him a hug.  Ugh.  So warm in my tum tum.
Jurassic Express has a boy from the Jungle, a dinosaur, a cage and now a GOAT!! BEST PPV EVER...
Simon the most genuine guy for a wrestling review and incredibly fun to watch. Simon give this an UPPPPPPPPPPP
AEW, it's a wrestling product by wrestling fans, for wrestling fans. Who would've thought people would absolutely go wild for it. Who would've thought that when you listen to fans, fans will actually like it.
WWE living in the past. AEW, giving the fans what they want.
I love that Simon is so elated and drunk on fun by just describing what he watched. I stopped watching wrestling after Impact went down hill. Then for whatever reason, I started watching Ups and Downs over the past year without watching much wrestling, then got into AEW and my lord, it makes me wonder why I ever stopped watching it. Simon is a huge part of what brought me back to watching wrestling and to see him so happy hes giving out golden ups like moxley giving out chops. Fantastic
Best ever? Do I need to watch this PPV? It can’t be better than WM17.
C.m punk said it best : "This Sh*t is fun again"
Vince McMahon you need to get your sh** together. AEW is taking all your people and taking over the business. You are definitely falling behind Vince.
Gayyyyy
Hands down the best ppv event ever
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
All out was a great show. I've never watched a full episode of Dynamite. In fact the most I've watched other than clips here and there is Punks promo from Rampage. I'm a Punk mark.  My only 2 "Downs" would be the pre show tag match. Way too hokey for me ( although Cassidy and Jungle Express are very very over ill admit. ) Secondly if you just tuned in during the Punk/Darby match and didn't who they were you would wonder why this man was beating up a 14 year old kid. ( It was a great match though )  I've posted negative comments on my opinion of AEW before. I still stand by my previous comments but I will say this PPV was up there IMO with WM17
Kris Statlander is my future wifey <3
😆Hey you, wherever you are in the world, if you’re reading this  … be BLESSED x 1,000,001 😊😊💛💛🙏🙏 😊😊💛💛🙏🙏😊😊💛💛
Where can I stream AEW? I don't want to subscribe to another service though. Already got too many.
Seeing Ups and Downs on the trending page is awesome. Well deserved for sure
72. As always, he said 72
Simon's reactions are exactly what my reactions were! His love for the business makes this program so great!
Its crazy but it's hard for Simon to give AEW 3 downs cause the product is so good 👍👍👍
Simon none of this actually happen! lol
I'm new and I was this close to ask you, how's going brazzers so sorry man.
Two things, Simon Miller: Miro didn't win with the Game Over. He won with the Matchka Kick version of Shingo Takagi's Pumping Bomber. The second thing: Sting's debut on Winter is Coming still remains the only Diamond Up that I've seen you give for an AEW moment. But this PPV was amazing. I think that if The Final Countdown wasn't so prohibitively expensive(even for Tony Khan), that Bryan Danielson entering to it, might've warranted a Diamond Up.
you probably get this a lot, but johnny sins?
Stop calling Daniel Bryan 😭
Simon Miller is the best there is on What Culture, the best there was in wrestling reaction videos, and the best there ever will be on YouTube. I love that he always refers to Chavo as eeewww Chavo and the line about The Butcher hating Orange Cassidy because he's a fruit so he can't sell him in his shop made me laugh harder than I should have. Never change Simon, you are a global treasure.
Simon totally OVER RATED that CM Punk return match. Punk looked VERY rusty n slow. That man can't keep up Darby pace lml👀
*AEW ALL OUT 3 = PLATINUM UP!!!!!*
I woke up this morning and said to myself, "Well, I bet Simon will have a measured, demure, low key reaction to All Out 2021."  You didn't let me down man!  Watching this review was almost as good as watching the show itself.  Thanks for being a fan Simon!
Kenny Omega, Chris Jericho, Jon Moxley, Cody Rhodes, Christian Cage, CM Punk, Bryan Danielson, Malakai Black, Orange Cassidy, PAC, Eddie Kingston, Lanche Archer, Brian Cage for the now. Adam Page, MJF, Adam Cole, Andrade El idolo, Darby Allin, Jungle Boy, Ricky Starks, Ethan Page, Wardlow, Sammy Guevara, Rey Fenix for now AND the future.  The potential of the male single division alone in AEW is *insane* .
The battle Royale was so well done, it felt like a royal rumble of old. Non stop action, from EVERYBODY, not just people lying around the ring waiting for the others to finish their spots.
We are living in the best timeline for wrestling.
Flip-flopping, no-selling, grand-standing, back-slapping, finisher-kicking nonsense. Bring back proper wrestling
AEW TAKING OVER
I can’t believe I was blessed enough to be in this crowd. What a phenomenal show. I’m gonna remember this night for the rest of my life. Look for my sign for the Cincinnati show.
The best ppv I ever seen in my life! AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW
Can't your AEW name be Simon The Shredder?
Lol wish I could leave a like every time I watch this always had me laughing and smiling the whole time
Imagine if they outdone ALL OUT at FULL GEAR. I believe they have all the tools to make that happen.
Lest we forget all of this (while funded by mister Khan) all began as a dream by a young man named Cody Rhodes. This was his vision, wrestling for and by wrestlers. Much love thanks and respect to Cody for his vision and the phenom it has become!
Easily a top 5 ppv of last 15 years. Only have 2 issues, wasnt a fan of the mjf match or ending, y2j is not in shape and mjf is the future. The kenny omega match and ending cuz i thought cage shouldve won and don calis is angry, gets on the mic, and is like hey didnt want to upset the elite, but i was worried that this might happen so i made a phone call earlier this week about bringing in an old friend to help restore the elite, then adam cole shows up.
AEW just won my heart with this PPV gonna start watching it now
Introduce the diamond up and platinum up
183 thumbs down from all of the WWE toddlers and mouth breathers that would love to gargle VKM's seed like it's Listerine.
Aew has taken over, its the best thing going in "wrestling". Smackdown second.. and raw a shrinking in the distance 3rd. Aew is so good I didnt mind paying the 50 bucks for the ppv. It was worth every cent.
Kinda funny how almost all ex WWE guys won thier matches. And then the end was an ex WWE guy saving the day from the heels. It reminded me of WCW when the Outsiders were made to look like the WWE somewhat invading WCW and they made the whole locker room look weak. Plus, you had CM (winded) Punk do to a  younger talent what he complained older guys would do in WWE.
I'm on that "redeem Deez nutz" t shirt. Brilliant!!
I have have enjoyed AEW since it first debuted. I think it's great there is some variety now. Though, in my mind, there is really no competition. AEW is really doing well.
You all our reaction vidio got highest reaction views of all time more then SummerSlam or mania we have dinally move the needle
177 angry WWE shills gave this a thumbs down
Adam this didnt actually happen this was a fantasy booking on reddit. Did I say Adam.. sorry I meant Alan.
That's was actually first time aew had that kind of finish and restart the match
I would have loved to watch Simon watch All Out live. I am sure he was going absolutely mental! I think Simon is overstimulated and head was going to explode! I'm guessing this will go down as a perfect pay per view for Simon!
This ppc deserves 100 golden up saying before watching
My question. Is how do you top this pay per view? I could have done without the Paul Wight vs QT, but other than that. All of the matches were at least 4*'s. I honestly wasn't expecting new tag team champions. But that tag team match was awesome! How are they going to give enough time for everyone? They just keep hiring more and more people. It's great for us fans, and I'm excited for the match ups we wouldn't get in WWE. Even though we have AEW Elevation, Dark, Dynamite, and Rampage. I would like to see a different rotation in wrestlers getting their opportunity to shine. AEW is killing it, and I hope they can continue to into the future.
26 March 2001 is the day WWE killed wcw on 5 September 2021 aew officially killed WWE (obiously quality wise money wise they never die) this day will go down in history and this was a perfect ppv
This is  a solid card and the care for the craft the creativity the crowd the story telling its so much different from wwe this is why I love pro wrestling I want to do this so bad
Amazing Holly Shit OMG AEW is Wrestling
I'm sooooooo damn happy that I was actually fortunate enough to experience this live. EASILY one of the best ppvs in the history of professional wrestling, I'll remember this literally forever. AEW is the future.
Did anyone feel like CM Punk is already teasing a heel turn?
For those who didn’t know the guy who played the guitar for Jericho is the  guitarist for jericho band fozzy
Top PPV of the year so far. The booking was on point and the debut were spot freakin on
Simon you fucking rule man! Your energy and stuff excitement for pro wrestling is mad clear
Damm i’m glad that my son gets to enjoy wrestling like I did thank you AEW
13:17 this entrance is probably the ONLY criticism i have from the show. They should have gotten the whole Fozzy. Just having their guitarist having wireless guitar problems was... A little sad actually but the rest of the show was spectacular
I know Double or Nothing was AEW's first official PPV ever, but I feel like All Out should be AEW's annual PPV, it truly was their  best PPV ever!!!
It appeared as if Jericho made an attempt at the original lion tamer, but couldn't get his leg back there, so he settled for the walls, lol.  Great match though.  Best PPV ever.
All Out didn't have a down moment , maybe the botched Jericho entrance but that is so insignificant that who cares , one of the best ppv ever and easily the best in the last few years
Love AEW Punk and Danielson are my movers. Kenny Omega's super fast "I have to get all I can say into this short time" promos makes me feel like he is nervous in his promos.
After the CM Punk vs Darby Allin match go and watch Bret Hart vs 1 2 3 Kid, it's literally the same match move for move it's amazing
Even just watching the highlights of this PPV showcases how amazing it was.
What a great show and thanks Simon for being you. Pro wrasslin eh haha
Your videos are the best your so funny & aew sits well in my tum tum 🙂
And to note, the guy playing was his guitarist from Fozzy
I love your take on the ref fixing the turnbuckle. It was different from anything I've really seen before.
The only thing that can make the next ppv as good is if hangman kicks out of the one wing angel and miro loses his title
Vince McMahon is crying in shame right now.
All Out Bay Bay!
The only bad match on the card was that godawful cage match. At least the tag titles mean something now that they're on an actual tag team
Show was average.  Daniel Bryan saved it at the end
I'm almost sure , Simon did it twice when he gave 2 Golden Ups at the same show and the show itself a Golden Up  This is First time where he gives 3 GOLDEN UPS & A GOLDEN UP for the show itself so this show holds the record ! It was amazing ! Simon you are amazing ! What a time to be a wrestling fan!
Seeing someone else as excited about this as I am always makes it that much better, great show. I flubbing love AEW, thank you Simon.
I'm starting to worry we won't see a title on Kingston
Hands down best ppv of the year.
It’s not even just a match. This whole show plus the card was Top 5 ever.
CM Punk vs Darby Allen was a tribute to Bret Hart vs 123 kid
I only watch What Culture because of Simon Miller!
Give this video a golden thumbs up 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I’m not even going to lie I haven’t gotten to into wrestling since middle school but I keep seeing all the hype about aew lately and this video alone is gonna make me watch this paper view . Simon just got me hyped about a bunch of fights I knew nothing about yesterday.
Is this the first ALL UPS episode of Ups and Downs?!? Is that the first GOLDEN UP for a whole show??? Mmmm this was perfection of a ppv
My 2nd ever bought PPV and holy _hell_ was it worth it!
You can't fake this sort of enthusiasm.  Thank you, AEW.
I feel bad for Simon who has to watch Raw after this masterpiece.
I give this an 477 golden Ups. I love this dude. No H*mo bro. Lol
This is the ultimate game changer in wrestling. What wwe are going to do now I have no idea. I simply don't care I loved All Out, AEW is the place to be and damn I love being a fan of professional wrestling atm.
Such an amazing night, will be remembered for years to come
This was the greatest ppv I've seen since the 90's. It was brilliant!!!  It was like bash at the beach 96 when hogan came out but the whole ppv felt like that moment times 100
Simon, solving global poverty isn't a bad use of your money.
Simon, you’re crazy - none of that stuff happened and it was the worst PPV in recent memory. When The Shockmaster crashed into the ring and pinned Omega by mistake to be the new AEW champion, I knew we were witnessing a new low in wrestling.   And that tag match with Young Bucks v Rellik and Matt Morgan was disgusting.
Jericho had "some guy" playing guitar during his entrance.... it's the guitarist from his band Fozzy, Simon! :P
ABC
Sounds so epic!
But did Cole really turn heel though? He literally came out of the heel tunnel wearing Jordans
I have watch 3 ppv's in the last few years and 2 were AEW. All Out being the third, geez omg was this amazing!!! Im so happy to be a wrestling fan. Thank you AEW for being wrestling back. And Simon give yourself a golden up!!! You deserve it!!!
I think this ppv is the best I have ever seen
Punk vs Darby was the highlight for me! It was a classic wrestling match,  It was like Bret Hart vs 123Kid evolved!
Jeff hardy vs darby allen
some guy playing guitar?? You Simon are the Judas in our minds!!
So are we just not gonna bring up all of Kingston's no selling?
“Of course the Butcher slammed him. He’s fruit and he can’t sell that in his shop.” Popped me harder than it had any right to. 🤣
And yeah no wonder Tony Khan threw 8 figures at the video game 😂😂 that game is going to be insanely good with a crazy roster. Give me GM mode!!
My friend just made the following point to me:  "I saw a list of talent that wasn't on the show and its insane   Black, Cody, Cage, Starks, Hangman, Dark Order...basically all the tag teams!...Sky/Page as well...  You could have an entire ep of Dynamite on Wednesday without using anyone who was on All Out and it would still be amazing."  He's not wrong, is he?  Honestly, they might as well fold WWE now as they as so far behind AEW and all the promotions they are working with, its getting embarrassing for them.  Without doubt, the best US produced PPV since Mania 17. Tremendous stuff.
This was my first AEW PPV and there wasn't a down on this show at all
Can I ask how they were able to use those tables in the main event without being DQ’d? Or does that BS only exist in WWE😂
That thumbnail is disgusting
We need to get you on a watch along with the rest of the team soon!
MJF is the best Heel Ever
Simon at 21:20 😂😂
My brother said this was probably the most fun he's ever had watching a Wrestling PPV.  My Brother is basically a Dementor.  He's miserable and sucks all joy out of a room.  So that's quite something.
Are guys serious? Were we watching the same show?! This was decent at best... The Bucks vs The Lucha Bros was the best match BY FAR. I knew that nothing was gonna top that.   Also the whole presentation of the PPV was boring, the video packages they played before the matches were too brief and told me absolutely nothing about what let up to the match, no exciting opening video package and why play fun heart pumping metal track when you play a down tempo chill beat to make everybody fall asleep?   Speaking of falling asleep, let's kick off with an out of shape Kingston to get the show started... I don't care about the predictablity of an ending, this show was A V E R A G E.   6/10 if I'm REALLY generous.
Lucha Bros are a special tag-team imo. They complement each other so perfectly and their chemistry is off the charts. Easily one of the best things about AEW atm.
All of the sneakerhead world cried when we saw what they did to those Travis Scott’s😭
If you didn't enjoy this PPV then you're either lying to yourself or you're not actually a _pro wrestling_ fan but a WWE fan 🤷‍♂️
Defining PPV of a generation
Here is the thing,  I love this show but we are giving a up to AEW for the same things we give it a down for WWE. Like the Big show match for example. Simon,  you are getting a down!
Simon using Karrion Kross Tshirt while reviewing this show is just such an irony.
How can WWE even compete with AEW now?
Best wrestling ppv in 20 years.
I couldn't love this more.  Golden up for Simon!
This was one of my favorite ups and downs...EVER.. it goes along with the last ups and downs you did for New Japan for WrestleKingdom
Also I saw a couple of people basing opinions of matches on crowd reaction only..i thought the pandemic n there not being fans would highlight m show more n. More that quality ain't based on if a bunch of drunk  people are yelling but I guess not..just a separate observation ation..not about you..
You know I listened to a couple review podcasts on the show..and I heard someone who didn't know britts Pittsburgh sunrise was a homage to Adam Cole...people who were shocked that he aligned with the Elite..so they don't know the history..dont understand the big deal with Minoru...which is why I beg for someone to do NJPW..BUT you explained why you can't on your podcast I discovered..which I understand..though you need to hire someone or have someone start reviewing or adding njpw news n shows..mi volunteer..but I add that because it shows the lack of knowledge the avg person has on .."the Forbidden door" and why it'd all happening..and understanding the business of pro wrestling..
AEW just killing it at the moment.
I love how excited you are because I felt exactly the aame
Jungle Boy Vs Adam Cole on Dynamite please
Killswitch from the top will kill some1 lol
The Lucha Brothers match legit got me a few times. Great PPV overall. Simon, you rock!
That steel cage match was so good I kept saying it like damn it was really good I love aew
That math at the end though lol
Best ppv since wrestlemania 17
Bruce prichard be like 0:00
477 golden ups!!!!!!!!
When Daniel Bryanson appeared it just hit me right in the chest. Can't wait to see what happens next. Glad the Lucha Bros are champions, they are one of the favourites in AEW.
Enjoyed the hell outta this one Simon
I'm happy for Ruby. She deserves a chance to shine! We ALL KNOW that WWE doesn't let people shine.
There were multiple parts where I was legitimately on my feet getting unreasonably hyped about what was going on. That hasn't happened since Chris Jericho beat The Rock and Stone Cold in the same night, easily the best PPV ever.
Simon just devolving when describing the Bay Bay and Bryan appearance was flapping hilarious. Genuine happy tears from my eyes at how joyous it all was...the description, the happiness pouring out of Simon. Golden UP
You really think about it Vince is probably pissing himself and saying why I let these people go lol
2.1 lakh views..!?🔥✨
Did Simon really suck on tiny khans pp Giving 477 ups to aew Shit man , he is just sold to aew
It is perfection!
Adam Cole vs Orange Cassidy!!! This popped in my head and now I NEED THAT
I've had to rewatch the ending multiple times just to make sure it was real.
Can confirm. Best ppv ever
I absolutely love ups and downs and Simon's enthusiasm. But Simon, come on my guy, the guitarist was none other than Billy Grey from Fozzy! Not some guy playing his entrance.
Aew is the best wrestling busy
Simon. YOU get a golden up 💛
Couple of things I think Simon missed. Penta's hug with his family *water coming from my eyes*. The women's battle royal -> Tay Conti, Bunny,  Penelope, Anna Jay mini-story. Otherwise he is absolutely spot on. I was marking out something cronic.
Adam Cole and Britt Baker are one cheeky couple. They both teased Adam's eventual debut on their respective PPV's. Adam hitting the Lockjaw and Britt hitting the Panama Sunrise
Middle rope. Not top rope, to finish the title match
Best PPV of our generation so far.
The crowd summoned Bryan Danielson with the YES chants like he was fucking Candyman. God I fucking love this company
I love how Simon thinks Butcher is an actual Butcher... (is he?)
The Lucha bros vs young bucks  match has overshadowed the Bucks vs Omega&Page match. Who would have thought, right? But that would be just the beginning, with all that potential matches in AEW, anyone else can, and maybe will, top that.
Rey and penta are something else
Not gonna lie, Adam Coles debut was perfectly timed as people were expecting Daniel Bryan, THEN WE STILL GET BRYAN!!!! I won't lie, I was fooled and that's why I love AEW
😳🤩🤯 that was awesome. Thank you Simon. golden up
When he's says give the bad bits a down and laughs and says ya right ya know it's a good show
The only thing with the whole soho thing. She comes in and she has 1 match, and she is the #1 contender. That was the big problem I had when lynch came back and won the title also.
Haters gonna hate, I don't give a damn about them I fckin love AEW product
AEDub just smashing it out the park, i wouldnt be watching wrestling anymore if AEW hadn`t arrived on the scene
Ok. So now where does AEW go from here? Now that everyone has debuted, I'm going to check them out. Real talk though,  the CM Punk match looked like a big brother beating up on his baby brother.
WWE is scrambling for some or any sort of relevance at this point.
What a pvp, best I've ever seen
where was cody tho?
I've gone more aew side than wwe as of late and I've watched wwe for over 25 years but aew is just slowly taking over more and more each week
awesome - 12 ups and golden ones too - id even say it deserved a diamond crusted UP - going to obliterate the system go all the way BAY BAY
Simon you should host the Simon awards you often say “he deserves some sort of award” How about the simons ?
LOL!! Simon is so fucking funny in this video!!!!
Tony Khan is the mad scientist of pro wrestling
This is thr reason I stopped watching WWE programming. AEW actually give you what you want and they actually do want you to be entertained. God I love this company
Made me fall in love with wrestling again!
This is the greatest episode of ups and downs ever 🤣
LMAOO @ Simon cursing
Ruby Riot , Adam Cole and Daniel Bryan are ALL ELITE. Nice !
Can't people wait one day to spoil plz
the Up Points of 477 (Golden), damn! that's insane
Gunner agree wyd ya Simon,,probably a Carlsberg of a PPV,, da athletes were up there,,,Lucha bros,,different league
All out is plain damn awesome! As always giving what wrestling fans want! brilliant! Bloody brilliant! From one wrestling fan to another, this is the best ppv I watched for a long time!
Simon, none of this actually happened. Was this in some weird fantasy book that you wrote?
Franky kazarian is being overshadowed
Hey I'm back to watch this , anyone else joining me?
RED VELVET's delivered the BEST SPEAR I HAVE EVER SEEN A WOMAN DELIVER, EVER! It was absolutely incredible and she really stepped up. Well done, Red Velvet! You did brilliantly! Also, well done to Jaime Hayter, she sold it like GOLD! Gosh damn, if you haven't seen it, go check her out. It was SICK!!
A small complaint in a fantastic show, but I wish they hadn't turned Cole heel immediately. Have him come out to the huge pop, fight with the Elite guys, slowly get overwhelmed, and then just when it looks like things are over, Flight of the Valkyries hits. They clear the ring together and end the show in more or less the same way. Cole then spends a couple of weeks cutting his usual excellent promos on the Elite about wanting revenge for how they left him last time they met, and ends up tagging with Danielson on the main event of Dynamite a few weeks from now. Cole turns heel on him and they beat the hell out of Danielson, setting up their match at Full Gear.
Out of all matches the only ones that really sucked was the Paul Wright match and that match I also completely forgot was a thing, I would say the Royal Rumble was bad but it delivered at the very end. The only match that pissed me off was Britt Baker winning but with the Royal Rumble Britt Baker had to win to set up Brit Bakers loss to Ruby or at least that better happen
How good is adding 456 golden ups to 12 and getting 477 as an answer.... Epic!👌🏻
He really is Buck Hogan now.
AEW is starting to pass WWE in giving wrestling fans what they want especially with Cena leaving to pursue a movie career. They are getting better and better.
You're a delight, Simon.
If you have seen one bucks match you've seen them all, but a lot of ppl are talking about this cage match so I might give it a shot
Simon Miller you are Legend. And not just Legend but a Golden Legend.
Just wanna say with Jungle boys dad Luke perry passing away just right before aew got going he must be on cloud 9 watching all the great things jungle boy is doing
This is a golden up
Zero downs? seriously? That was one bloated bland snooze fest of a ppv. The fact that ex wwe guys got the loudest pops has a lot to say about the quality of their product. If the same crap was put out by wwe, everyone would be whining over here. 😩
Simon was 100 % correct.. this PPV was better than any wrestemania!!! Every match was great and had a purpose.. worth every penny
For me AEW is making wrestling exciting to watch again.
“PFFT” -Simon
I laughed so hard at the fan that had the giant cutout of Conrad Thompson', head.  Don Callis is awesome (not a nimrod)! Hold my scarf!
Right after All out went off the air, my next anticipated show I wanted to watch was whatCulture and what Simon’s ups and downs were going to be…..Saw a few other videos but Simons tales are the only ones that matter. Ok now to actually watch…can’t wait!
Never purchased a PPV before but something told me to do it worth every penny what a show
I would really like to know what you really thought about the AEW event. LmFAO. You are awesome Simon
Idk how WWE can keep up rn… if AEW keeps this up.. we’ll hopefully WWE will change. AEW brought me back to a childhood like glee.
I like chocolate
Crater: "You Keep Using That Word, I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means”
best ppv ever.??nahhh..not..by..far... lucha bros was awesome, jericho match and main event were great .. rest  ok.. punk was very disappointing
it was PERFECT
Not to be a Debbie Downer but 456+12 = 468 not 477. Other than that...I absolutely love this video and your reactions to this epic PPV. Keep up the good work and fire whoever can't do math lol
I FUCKING LOVE BEING A WRESTLING FAN RIGHTY NOW!!! 29 years old and I’m excited like a kid again.
Cole, Soho and BD had the biggest smiles on their faces which spoke volumes
22:40, ahhhh ahhh ahhhh I'm dying laughing
Vince McMahon must be senile because Simon did point out the fact that Daniel Bryan wrestled at wrestlemania in the main event and yet still didn’t give in to his demands and now Adam Cole is there too along with CM punk we are in for a great time to be a wrestler FAN ! This is going to go down in history as a game changer probably even better than WCW in 96
Absolutely perfect!!!!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
5-10 yrs down the line- on Retro Ups and Downs, - this week we got the best PPV of all time.
I really enjoyed the Punk Match, I was just glad that both men got time to shine, I'm glad that Punk is still one of the best in the world and after the ppv I'm overall just a happy person
Dear Vince,  This is how you book a great wrestling show.    Sincerely,     True wrestling fans
Why was the TNT Title defended? Isn’t that the whole point of that title…to be defended on…wait for it…TNT??
Simon this wasn’t real was this in some sort of fantasy book you wrote?
I bet Hunter is plotting a homicide at this point
Billy Grey from Fozzy was playing Judas
Are we gonna finally say it? AEW is Pro Wrestling
Def one of the best PPVs of all time, I think its AEW's best for sure (took a lot for me to edge out Revolution 2020)
I thought I was trippin when i thought this was an all time great ppv. Thank you Simon and all for confirmation
“Trust not a woman when she weeps, for it is her nature to weep when she wants her will.”            -- Socrates
You even called him big show…his character is garbage version of big show. Down.
this is easily the best ppv  of the last 5 years and ik Vince is freaking out tryna figure out how to top this
Does someone keep track of all of simons ratings? If not someone should.
It’s exactly as you described. Unreal event
I'm sorry. I loved the PPV, but Simon's on that good stuff if he gave the Paul Wight vs. QT match an up. Paul was limping on his way to the ring! Appreciated the effort by both guys, but it was the one smudge on an otherwise great PPV.
That money comment gets a golden up!!🤣
So I would love to see you guys do a video on all the golden up moments aew has received since the start of the company
WWE Marks disliked this video
I felt like I was a kid back in the late 90s early 2000 watching incredible wrestling again every match was great and the debuts were incredible
Punk and Darby Allen match was a remake of hart vs 123 kid
Fans that dislike how they got treated in wwe is getting Cole, Punk, Danielson in the same organization. I missed their whole wwe era though
Should have known Adam Cole was going to join the Elite; he came out of the heel tunnel
Simon gets an golden UP!!
Here i am like AEW is awesome at just great week to week programming that builds to an ultimate & awesome & legendary PPVs. Here's my wife, awww now Adam Cole and Brit Baker are together in AEW. Lol. Needless to say, we friggin loved All Out. AEW certainly went...All Out. Adam Cole debut the same way he did in NXT & it was  better in AEW tbh
You Simon also get a Golden Up for this reaction video.
Best ppv I have ever watched
First off, Simon I love these...never change. These ups/downs have become mandatory viewing now.   Secondly, I was just blown away by how good last night's PPV went down. Seriously, like I was still so hyped hours later. What a great time to be a wresting fan, and what a joy it is to be an AEW fan right now.  The cage match won the night for me...I've just never seen anything like it. That was the best cage match I've seen, and I think it's the second best tag team match I've seen from AEW...only to come behind the Young Bucks vs Kenny Omega/Adam Page. But it's very very close...
I feel just like Simon.  It was absolutly amazing
I’m not even a AEW fan, but nothing WWE has done all year even comes close to this show.
Ngl, I feel like people who saw All Out are gonna be in for a serious disappointment if they watch RAW. 😬 Imagine having to follow All Out.
2 seconds in and I'm already laughing. Never change Simon.  After the show I immediately thought - yep golden up
You people better f'n admit it that AEW f'n spoiled us at that ppv,it obviously was the best ppv ever since AEW's last couple ppv's,it was so much better than any ppv WWE has done since the attitude era period lol
So happy for Ruby Soho :)
Simon gets something on his lip in the beginning
Simon, was this PPV a dream? Slap me silly and wake me up!
Simon, none of this actually happened. Was this in some weird fantasy book that you wrote?   ;)
“It was like the Undertaker losing at Wrestlemania.” 😂😂😂😂😂 The dramatics. No the hell it was not. Grown men were crying and losing their shit. Not even close to the same. But, ok.
Penta busted open. I hope he's alright
Damn, WWE going out sad.
Being there was something I’ll never forget. The building was a fucking eclectic factory the entire night.
Riho was not eliminated. She went underneath the rope. It's a down
Hey Simon is wearing karrion Kross new shirt! 😱😏🤣
We need to demand YouTube give this channel a *GOLDEN* LIKE 👍🏼 button for this video!
I am starting to love wrestling again. What a time to be alive.
When he started dropping F-bombs  I died!!!!
One of my favorite videos in a while, your reactions at the end were hysterical
Dope shirt
The only way they counter this by WM is giving us Lashley/Lesnar and Rock/Roman like that’s the only thing to get close to as good as AEW last night
There's no topping that show. Now its up to the booking to be compelling enough going forward. Can't keep relying on signing names from wwe
Jesus Miro does a dropkick and people lose their minds...the bias towards AEW is ridiculous lol
I still wish Bryan had come out to "the Final Countdown."
You my friend are the reason I have restarted liking wrestling.
As a fan of wrestling since I was watching Hulk Hogan and Macho Man, Sting and Flair, to the days of WCW vs WWE, ECW, TNA, etc... I've grown bored and lost interest in pretty much everything...now AEW is here and puts on one of the best wrestling shows ever and I'm suddenly a fan again. It was a pretty awesome show and the talent is actually having fun and doing whatever they want..of they mess up. Oh well. No Vince to yell at them and cancel their push. They are having fun and are happy which translates into better matches and more creative product. It's great to see this finally in a promotion..and they keep us guessing which makes it even more intriguing. As always Simon just kills it with his reviews and he seem so happy to be watching a fun product like all of us are. Wrestling is cool again 😎
one criticism the one winged angel was from the 2nd rope not the top.
Love u AEW love u pro wrestling❤❤
All Out > any wrestlemania
This was my first AEW PPV and I’m definitely keeping up with this show now
Awesome ppv
Miro's drop kick was as beautiful as they come, too.
Haven’t looked forward to the show after a PPV this much since the Nitro after Bash at the Beach 96.
As an old jaded wrestling fan, this was the first ppv I've bought since WrestleMania 30 and I had a great time with it. The matches were all really fun, the unexpected surprises were excellent, and the surprises we kinda knew about were executed in brilliant ways that made them still feel huge. All Out was well worth the money and it did that extra little thing of selling the next show because, c'mon, Suzuki vs Moxley!
And now we all watch raw .........I just hope this makes then step it up
First time I've watched a live show in years, so this is pretty well the first time I've watched a normal Ups & Downs as opposed to the retro show. Fantastic stuff Simon.
Hahahahahaha best PPV of all time.... WOW
This video get up as well👍👍👍👍
I thought you liked all wrestling Simon!! Seems pretty AEW biased to me but that's just my opinion. Never get this excited about WWE in the same way... just my opinion.
I’m a WWE lifer but MY GOD are they in trouble 😂😂😂😂 I’m loving AEW so much
I was in tears when Kaze Ni Nare started. I can't believe I'm about to see Suzuki live from the front row at NJPW Strong Autumn Attack!
i was the same as simon at the end lmao just a mumbling mess, so many surprises, this show was sick
someone doesn't know what 12+456 is....
Hearing the entire crowd shouting Bay Bay was quite awesome!
Yeah...but what are they going to do next week?
September 5, 2021. The day wwe officially died and a unstoppable force emerged and broke the iwc AE fuckin W!!! I mean just look at the staged roster mjf,brayn,punk,cole,omega,Christian,Tommy end,miro,pac,Y.B,Lucha bros,andrade,jungle boy,Adam page, Rhodes, moxley and veteran like JerichoI mean wth is this even real real? This is even better than a video game roster. This type of roster was only possible as a action figure collection but AEW just broke the measuring stick for sure. WWE can pack their bags and accept defeat
Simon, none of this actually happened.  Was this in some kind of fantasy book you wrote?
This was the best PPV I've seen in years.  If not best ever! Such a good time to be a fan.
Best Wrestling pay per view ever!!!! best Ups and Downs ever!!! This episode of Ups and Downs gets a golden up!!!!
Aew knows how to put on a show every ppv gets better and better
After watching Wrestlemania: "Decent, thumbs up."  After watching All Out: "OMFG I can't believe what I just witnessed!"
"He's a fruit he can't Has  him in his shop " that made me chuckle. But yeah this Has the potential to be ppv of the year. Punk returning, new tag champs, Miro looking like a beast (that fucking dropkick tho 🤯) Adam Cole (BAY BAY!)  debuting then Bryan Danielson debuting. Kojima v Moxley was awesome as well. How the hell is Kojima in such good shape !?
As a fan that grew up on the attiture era when wrestling was fun I have to say this whole PPV was awesome no complains at all. All out was the first wrestling PPV I order since the early 2000s and I tell you what worth every penny the young bucks and the lucha bros  I would compare that match to shawn michaels and razor first ladder match it.
one of the best wrestling ppv's in recent history
The booking was amazing for the show. The pacing was great.
The photo of Adam Cole getting kissed by the Young Bucks has become iconic now lol
I loved when the people near me started shouting "BIG STRONG GIRL!" For Kris when she did that move off the ropes with Brit
Vince, i bid you adieu, AEW would like like to say goodbye, and good...night BANG!
That Young bucks vs lucha bros best match I’ve seen in awhile I was so invested into it but that could also be said for most of the matches. best ppv ever
Simon, none of this happened. You fell asleep watching SummerSlam and have fantasy booked the best PPV in YEARS!
all out was amazing. best ppv in a long while. bucks vs lucah bros was perfect. jericho made me cry. so much excitement from a ppv. im glad im a wrestling fan.
I was there and it was amazing best wrestling I have ever seen.
it was an incredible show
Possibly the best show I've watched in a decade. Absolutely an unbelievable wrestling show and I am so pumped
Miro did what Eddie asked him to - he redeemed his nuts.  Ask and you shall receive.
Lads! All we need is Windham Rotunda and it is GAME FUCKING OVER!!!!!
Biggest pops of the night from myself and my 7 year old son were Bryan danielson debuting and the end of the cage match! Great ppv we had a blast watching it
not sure how i feel about moxley being out of everything and doing the new japan tour. the boys love it, which is so mox, but i dont want him buried either.  He is the OG, before all these guys.
Simon luv ya
Oh yea and Tony Khan showed Vince McMahon how to make a great PPV, how to make surprised people and make sense
Simon, you make the videos very entertaining. I grew up an NWA fan, and initially stopped watching wrestling in 1984 when the WWF came to Toronto. AEW has brought back to me the love I had for wrestling when I was younger. Excellent card. Great video.
I can't remember seeing an Ups and Downs that had not only double digit Ups but no Downs at all,  and triple digit Golden Ups on top of all of that with an Golden Up as the cherry.  Insane!
AEW showcasing how a wrestling show should be from the relevance of the titles to the story telling to the way the show was put together! Simon thanks for the review the way you do it like all of us as wrestling fans !!
When Simon says it, people listen.
After seeing AEW All Out 2021, it's clear that working for Vince McMahon makes it not fun being a pro wrestler. Every former WWE superstar that came out for All Out had huge smiles on their faces which tells me that they are happy doing what they love again.
The fact that CM Punk's match didn't go last show how much respect they show to the World Championship
Love AEW!
I love how you call Chavo "ooohh Chavo"
That was hands down, the best tag team match, and overall pay per view this year. LITERALLY.
Love adam Cole new theme banger
I like the “Dark Knight Rises” reference. ☺️
12 ups + 456 golden ups =??? Who cares about the math, flubbin amazing ending
Lucha Bros vs Young Bucks by far best match of the ppv. Omg! Incredible
If statlander is from the andromida galaxy, what galaxy is rey phoenix from??
I was very sports entertained
Best wrestling PPV I’ve seen in a very long time and what’s crazy is that unfortunately the Andrade/Pac match got canceled if not that would’ve even made the event significantly better as well. Assuming Andrade would’ve won, AEW could’ve probably had the Lucha bros come out join Andrade after becoming Champs and pushing Andrade for a TNT title shot V miro after his Victory earlier that night.
It was hilarious to see all those clowns, WWE rejects, glorified jobbers and hobbits all in the ring at the same time at the end.
Jericho’s guitarist is the only down
I don't watch anything but NJPW anymore. But AEW has started having shows that make me feel like a wrestling fan again, and now I watch NJPW and AEW, and that's not a bad thing...  That's... A good thing.
I wasnt able to watch it live, so when he got to the battle royal and announced the joker, Ruby Soho, I tell you, I popped so hard lol
AEW cost the same amount as UFC in my country so I would rather pay that much money to watch real fights but thanks ups and downs looked like a good show
Honestly I don't mind most of this video but come on man if bigshow beat someone in WWE in under 5 minutes you'd all be calling BS and WWE burying younger talent!! "How can I complain about that" well Simon you damn did when they had him beat Cesaro a few years back or winning his last few wwe matches 🤷‍♂️
When Ruby Soho looked at the ref in disbelief that she when and then gave him a hug.  Ugh.  So warm in my tum tum.
AEW WAS SO GOOD
This PPV as a whole deserves a golden up. Absolutely incredible show! Great job as always by Simon to bring up the emotions brought by this absolute banger of a show. Never change. You're amazing!
Wish I could have seen HHH's reaction to the main event
477 golden ups
This was officially the day WWE died....
For a teenager growing up in the attitude era, not only has my love for wrestling come back after 20 years, but its surpassing anything I’ve ever seen. AEW are by far and away the greatest wrestling company on the planet right now.
Wish I could afford the AEW PPVs, but I’ll get the DVD some day and own it forever.
If the show did finish after the main event I would be extremely happy! It would be a 8.5 only because the still weak women division! But that ending...man! Made me feel 14 again! 9.5 and a chef kiss! 👌
I knew MJF would lose the Jericho match when MJF came out dressed in tights reminiscent if Ric Flair. When Ric was going to lose a match, he wore his red trunks.
"Some guy playing guitar" = Billy Grey. The second guitarist in Fozzy, who is way better than you think. Really nice guy too.
Simon is on fire here 😂
An absolutely incredible show from top to bottom…. Quite excellent indeed.
I didn't see it all but i absolutely loooovvved omega vs cage and that whole ending segment
Simon Miller WE LOVE YOU!
Simon get a Golden Up for this one, love watching his reactions. ☝☝☝
The Young Bucks match was incredible, as in not credible.
Next year. Bring Finn and aj and wwe is done. The elite is amazing and Adam Cole is one of my favorites. Dream came true. Bring Finn and aj.
18:15 Thanks for the drink, Simon. xD
Simon gets a golden up
I wasn't a fan of the miro/kingston match, the match made Miro look weak IMO, Eddie dominated the majority of the match.
I feel like I'm the only one that thinks nick Jackson was channeling hulk Hogan circa nwo with the way he dyed his beard lol only Hogan ever dyed his like that with the blonde handlebar mustache and black beard. The earrings and shit remind me of 90s Shawn Michaels also
WWE is dead AEW is the future
Best ppv of all time lol why because of Adam cole and Daniel Bryan only 1 good match maybe 2
brill show but did cm punk /ruby have to win think not but thats life other wise like people say the best ppv for ages
Lol MJF as burgerkingguy
Def glad i got this on fite so awesome to be a wrestling fan now ;)
I wasn't a fan of the Britt/Kris match. I didn't like Kris effectively getting squashed.
Simon Miller is literally living the dream in this video. I love it what a time to be alive
For me, the debut of Adam Cole was bittersweet, because he had had so much more he could have done in WWE if they had extended his contract and sent him to the main roster., but I also love the fact that I am still going to get to see him on my television screen. Daniel Bryan on the other, I was 100% pumped for and literally jumped up in excitement when Flight of the Valkyries started because he spend almost 12 years in the WWE and basically did everything he could and had nearly the dream matches you could think of, so seeing him in a new company allows for so much more to happen.
Actually, the cut on Moxley’s elbow which opened up in the match with Kojima was from putting Matt Cardona through light tubes to win the GCW title belt the night before  BTW, I’m fairly certain that many people will be watching this PPV again rather than the three hours of shite we normally get from the other company on Monday nights! I know I will be….
24:00 me to Simon. it feels good doesnt it? ;)
I think the downside of this PPV is the match between Paul Whight and QT Marshall and the Women's Battle Royale. Other than that, the rest was 5 stars!
When he said the Young Bucks are one of the best teams of all time I had to stop watching.
MJF such a talent and is being so wasted at AEW.
This PPV made me a wrestling fan again. With WWE in the past, i would skim through most of the PPV just to get to the good parts. Meaning that i would watch it a day later pre-recorded.  BUT, with AEW All Out, the first time i saw a Wrestling PPV from start to finish LIVE.
Bucks vs Lucha Bros was not all that too me. It was a little too much involved
Man.... All we now need is Bray Wyatt... If Bray Wyatt shows up in AEW, I might just watch wrestling again... Holy motherfucking shit... AEW is doing it, it's living the dream... AEW is beating WWE by being the better product... And I can't believe that we went from WWE being legitimate shit for many years and then having a few golden moments.... To now having AEW deliver banger, after banger, after banger. It's absolutely insane.
The first wrestling PPV I’ve bought in a long, long time and I got my money’s worth and then some. Made me feel all warm and fuzzy in my tum tum
Best £15 I've ever spent
Craters don't smash into things.
It was the BEST
Here for all the "Simon is being paid by Tony Khan" comments 😂   Nah it's just that AEW is that damn good!
ALL OUT was great, but just imagine the PPV they will have with ALL the new superstars on the card……Now that’s gonna be one hell of a PPV.
When the show ended, I stood and applauded and threw roses at my TV screen. This show was so good, I ordered it as a topping on my pizza the next day. This show was so powerful, it’s currently lighting my house. This show was so flawless, they made it into a facial cream that goes for an amount I can’t type on here.
"It made me all warm and fuzzy in my tum tum" 😂😂😂
for shows like this you should make "THE DIAMOND UP", by the way one of the best wrestlings PPV nono i mean the best PPV in the last decade or so!!! SALUTES SIMON ALL THE WAY FROM TIJUANA MEXICO!!!!
10 thumbs up, sorry I'm just amazed how great this PPV was, one of the best on this modern area, so well executed
I hadn't watched more than 15 minutes of a wrestling show since WrestleMania earlier this year ...and boy howdy! I picked a good show to tune in on
Hey, Simon, you have "Surprise Roll-up" counts and "Distraction Finishes" for WWE, how about an "After Match Beat-down"  counter for AEW? You'd probably get to treble figures in a couple of months, if you include the Dark and Dark Elevation programming!
That sucks ! Adam coke should have stayed in WWE
One company does four hours of loooong entrances, commercials, and lame skits with sports entertainment events sandwiched in-between. Another does, in the same amount of time, wrestling matches, a handful of well-produced promos, while introducing new signees. Both left you exhausted, but for different reasons.
Maybe i'm just an idiot, but this event feels like it will have far-reaching, profound effects on the world of wrestling, from the big-time companies to the smallest of indy promotions (which is where skye blue is from)...
Between Punk , Cole , Daniel and Ruby Brock out weighs them all combined  lol Be afraid Vince
After watching this PPV its the first time I’ve thought “hmm WWE might actually have some serious competition”
Anyone know the non-kayfabe reason Skye Blue replaced Julia Hart in the battle royale?
This show was so much fun. I haven't had this much fun watching a show since WM 3 & 4
So if you didn't like it, clearly you didn't watch  On the nose?
A golden up doesn't do this PPV justice. And neither does a platinum up, nor a diamond up, make any sense either.  Somebody give these goofs a Plutonium Up because they F#&%ING went Bat S*** Nuclear.  No Bulls***.  And since TK is handing out Debuts like Oprah, F#&& IT. Simon, you too can have a Plutonium Up because you're a delight to watch. 👍  Also, TK is now officially the Ricardo Monelbán of pro-wrestling's Fantasy Island. IDC, don't @ me if you disagree. 😁
I already liked AEW, but this show was the one that well and truly got my attention
Amazing Amazing Awesome!!
One of the best if NOT the best wrestling PPV of ALLLLLL TIME!!!!! It had me at the edge of my seat the entire time…..the cage match stole the show!!!
I authentically believe we all universally agree that it's more than acceptable that there wasn't a single down on this show
Spot on bro! Spot on!! Thanks!!
This is one of the best ending swerves on any PPV.   When Cole turned heel, anyone would think that would leave The Elite on top...then the Danielson debut swerved it, again.   It was genius!
Miro using a low blow to set up the win after Kingston walked out in the Redeem Deez Nuts t-shirt. Layers bay bay!
I watched the show last night and I remembered what it was to really enjoy wrestling
Totally upset with the call I wanted jurassic express 2 beat the bucks for the titles
The only down I give is ruby soho
WWE is officially dead AEW is too much for them to handle 😭AEW just keeps raising the bar higher and higher
AEW!!!! AEW!!!!! AEW!!!!!
Are we gonna ignore the fact that the referees did their job 2 times on this ppv which basically can be a meme because referees are never doing their jobs properly?
The best Purchased I bought and it was my first AEW PPV and the first wresting ppv since 10 years ago lol it’s worth every penny and the ending was amazing
As much as I love Daniel Bryan, it was weird to see him in an AEW ring. Hope he goes back to WWE someday and he retires there as the legend he is.
I have not felt like this watching a wrestling event in a long time…AEW is doing a great job
Simon u r the man  Unfortunately I couldn't get the ppv br live was having massive issues here on the east coast in the states they need 2 fix that but love ur videos brother
Cantidad believe wwe let adam cole go. The guy has star written all over his body. Mindblowing.
I can’t think of a more stacked card than this.
I can say that was the “Most Exhilarating” wrassling show I’ve ever seen! All the bouts had you wanting more.
The absolute best PPV ever.
AEW is pro wrestling and WWE is sports entertainment and I am a pro wrestling FAN.
I laughed so hard when the crowd booed when Nyla Rose eliminated Hikaru Shida in the battle royale lol
I've only watched highlights but just from that I agree with Simon totally. That cage match damn! Punk and Darby, Adam Cole Bay Bay! And Bryan Danielson. Stupid stupid WWE when are they gonna learn to recognise and utilise the talent they have? And I didn't even mention Ruby. Please AEW get Liv Morgan too and hook her up! I never thought I'd have to consider watching wrestling regularly again but I might have to.
Could this be legit the best ppv of all time?
No one kicks out of the OWA No One… and that’s just regular not avalanche
People will look back at All Out 2021 as a monumental moment in wrestling history.  The match quality was off the charts and the surprise appearances were very well executed.
I’m thinking way to far ahead but I hope CM punks last match in AEW is a championship loss to Darby Allin to put him over even more on his way out
AEW is the Smash Bros. of wrestling.  Well said.
It was so smart bc everybody was distracted by Adam cole being there they did realize Adam came out of the HEEL tunnel so they literally told us he was gonna join the elite before he got to the ring
That cage match was one of the best matches ive ever seen
UP
I was trying to be quiet because everyone was asleep but I screeched like a girl when bd came out
pretty sure riho getting eliminated by getting kicked under the bottom rope should be a down because that doesn't make sense.
MJF won the match! Jericho got the foot on the rope after the 3!
That some guy playing his entrance is the lead guitarist from Fozzy... love you Simon but maybe just do a bit more research on stuff. Because those 2 entrances earned a up befor the match
Ruby the first joker (I think) to ever win the battle royal
All Out 2021 was the show to break any scale or measurements in the last twenty years. We could have gave it another 477 golden ups..... It was worth it!
Aew all out was awesome.. am glad that they don't do ppv every month that would be extremely hard to pull off every time.. you definitely got your money worth out of it.. it wasn't even close to WWE stuff am happy to be a aew fan..
I love each time you say "Ooooh" before "Chavo"
Last night sold me as an AEW fanboy. In no way do I think WWE could do what AEW did last night in the foreseeable future.
I'm sure glad I decided to listen to Simon and tune into AEW a few months ago.  I had watched a show here or there, but mostly given up on watching wrestling. Jericho was always one of my favorite way back when and his story with MJF is one of the best I've ever seen.    So happy for Ruby!
This show was like WrestleMania X7 in the fact, only a nut would hate on this show.
Adam Cole instantly turning heel was brilliant. The boo was equal to the pop.
It was a 10 out of 10 ppv. Im glad that AEW finaly turned from a gynastic into a wrestling show. Cant believe that even young bucks stopped being gynastic coaches. Can anyone tell me why
I didn’t realize it until I watched it again that Adam Cole came out the heel tunnel, foreshadowing the kick to Jungle Boy.   Just great work by all!
Vince you watching?
I love it so much that you call him ooh Chavo
While the show was probably AEW best PPV so far let's not pretend there are no downs. MJF tap out to Jericho is a booking mistake and should be considered a down. Also Paul Wight vs QT had no business on that card especially being the second to last match. That's a match they should have just happened on Dynamite. Other than those two things, the rest of the show is a strong thumbs up.
All this injection of new talent coming to AEW is great but as a life long Christian Cage fan I just hope he isn't forgotten about again. His work in the ring is so incredible he has the ability to make all the talent he faces look better. I'd love to see a program between Christian and Miro or Adam Cole.
Didnt even get to watch the ppv, but just watching simon with the recap gave me chills thinking about how amazing this show was put together. Loving pro wrestling right now!
Without listening I'll speak of the negatives since he's never able to die to bias  ✓ Paul Wight match was a waste ✓Women's Battle Royale was very bleh until the last 5-7 +/- contestants ✓ The Young Sucks vs Lucha Bros was a HIGH SPOT GYMNASTIC NO SELLING NO RING PSYCHOLOGY FEST....that's not real wrestling. Are the choreographed moves neat? Sure. They are, really.  But it's not real wrestling.  ✓ Omega vs Christian wasn't as good as their Rampage match and Christian CARRIES Omega. I said what I said.  ✓ As long as you expect Moxley to no sell for long then his match was average.
Where’s Trent?
I really hope Vince was watching and taking notes. After all these years of phoning it in, we need some great WWE ppvs
did they flirt a bit with heel punk? heel entrance flirting, slowing down match and trying to win by countout? :)
This was so much fun to watch.  I feel you Simon, it was excellent.  Reminds me of 20 years ago when the internet wasn't spoiling everything and it was just fun and exciting.
Easily the best pay per view of all time!!  I love to see Simon so excited! His reactions mirrored my own. And now a roommate of mine watched it with us, and he is hooked on AEW.
The golden up goes to the crowd for staying amped up the whole night
Love aew, it is great with all the wwe stars coming in, hopefully braun strowman, bray wyatt and buddy Murphy join soon, so many dream matches to come
WWE saying they’re not worried about AEW is going to be their downfall because AEW is just superior in every way.They should be taken very seriously
Can anyone remember the last time any PPV was so successful   Wow. Just wow
Wwe better step up there game
Ciampa and gargano where you at?
That was an all time PPV. Just fuckin' outstanding.
Think you need to give platinum ups because that was out of this world ppv!!
All Out 2021 was one of the best shows of the year. Very excited to see what is to come
Vince should wisen up.
Kenny Omega is Wrestling God !!!!!
This PPV was absolutely magical. I mean, the madness between Bucks/Lucha Bros, that entrance swerve by MJF (which was absolutely brilliant, he should be a heel for life), CM Punks not missing a beat and that ending...holy shit, did I pop when Adam Cole came out of the tunnel. And then, like Simon said, within 10 seconds he turns heel. My mind could not comprehend what I was seeing.  Tony Khan, whatever you do...please stick with this course for the rest of time. Your booking is fantastic, your talent is obviously happy with where they are and you give us quality shows every week.
Kingston's shirt is awesome
Love you Simon.   When are you joining AEW
Simmons broke my heart when he said if I did have  million dollars I would give it to you
This was by far the best PPV, in like the last decade...no lie. Every match was just, WOW
Is it just me, or is anyone else scared that Malakai Black and Andrade are just going to get lost in the shuffle now? Like, where do they go after their current feuds?
Simon Miller this is the first time I bought a pay-per-view in a long time is this was the best pay-per-view I seen this year match the night definitely was Chris Jericho mjf
This ppv was nuts and has Simon acting like a crazy person 😂 epic! I'm so happy to see Adam Cole in aew
This was the best PPV I’ve seen probably ever
Where was Adam Page ?? Andrade El Idolo waste of time bring him in ?? Eddie Kingston ?? Malakai Black on this show… Probably won’t see Cole and Bryan for awhile…
Mannnnn WWE going out of business! 😂 i bet Wrestlers from the 2000’s are wishing they had this opportunity! This company is splendid‼️
Was the best ppv i’ve seen in a while
O I almost forgot...Simon you bald bafoon!
great ppv
Adam Cole bey bey! Bryan Danielson and Ruby! I loved it !
Simon sure has a massive hard on for Daniel Bryan doesn’t he…
you are right !, only AEW has the balls to pull that kind of ppv show. one of the best, if not the best PPV  P.S As usual, your review and ratings are top-notch and  keep up the good work your, you Asshole
That tag title match was the best of the whole night.
I'm so glad that I purchased this. Was worth every penny! Finally cancelled the WWE network last month and now I have fully committed to AEW. Yeah, I get you can be a fan of both. But how long can people seriously put up with WWE insulting it's fan base? Especially since AEW is ticking all the right boxes. Fun times ahead.
definitely expecting the dragon. but adam cole was a nice surprise. and i am pretty sure that is a speed record for a heel turn LOL
I am gonna point something out  If WWE were to put Big show vs … I don’t know, Elias, for no real reason before the main event You’d give it a down
I couldn't have rated this show any better myself. I'm still cleaning myself up from it. Last night was a good night to be a "mark"
Best PPV of all time.
"Lets see what have I got in my pocket, oh yea its an up" 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Simon is the GOAT
Probably the best pay per view for a long time, this has made me want to watch wrestling again.
This has to go down as one of the greatest PPVs ever and must be the highest score ever on "Ups and Downs" too
Darby,MJF and Qt all got buried but the fans wont say that cuz its AEW, but hey if it was WWE they will bitch about said wrestler being buried.Also time to start releasing talent AEW starting with Spears and Cage both are being jobbed and never used but you AEW doofus dont wanna talk about that. overall decent show but Women division still dog shit and ruby isnt gonna help.
You, Simon, get a golden like, and a golden subscribe
It's official. The wars are back.
Simon dropping f bombs 😂😂😂
That Adam Cole swerve before Brain Danielson was amazing. Hell, I don’t even like that pip-squeak Cole that much!
I like WWE but I Love AEW
Every review video I've seen has the host/s being surprised that Adam Cole kicked Jungle Boy. And that they weren't expecting it...  HE WALKED OUT FROM THE HEEL TUNNEL!  One video said they expected something was up because he was wearing Jordans. I wasn't even looking at his shoes. But I noticed the tunnel he came out of.  If they wanted a bigger swerve, they should of had the lights go out, Adam Coles music hits and he's standing behind The Elite.  Also, the whole 'forbidden door' schtick seems to only be for Moxley these days. Has anyone else walked through that door and challenged someone other than Moxley?
Omgoodness this is the most entertaining whatculture show I’ve ever seen. Absolutely the best thank you for bringing it to life , last nights show was awesome.
How do you cap off the amazing excitement that was All Out? By seeing how excited Simon got from watching All Out! An Ups and Downs worthy of the PPV it was reviewing!
477 Golden ups.....yeah that sounds about right XD.
I'm sorry but we will never see such a good tag teams match in WWE anytime soon *Lucha vs YB is a 11/10 match*
Best ppv ever reviewed by the best wrestling reviewer ever.  Awesome👍👍👍
Who remember when people hated Simon? Cause I do lol
BEST... PPV... EVER...
Let's give everything an up on this show !
Such a great ppv. No downs in my opinion! I wish I was there!
I think you should unveil a platinum up for that lucha bros, young bucks match... that was god tier
4 hours that felt like 40 minutes, that much the PPV kept me engaged until the very last minute ... with the risk to sound like the markest of marks, it was the best event that I have watched in ages!
What is the difference between this PPV and some of the best WWE PPV's? The wrestlers here ALL actually looked like they were enjoying themselves. They were having FUN. And it was infectious throughout the show. They knew they were knocking everything out of the park.
That was my first aew Ppv and it was one of the best I have seen in years and years of watching pro wrestling
Miss Statlander is a bonified legend! Also where the eff is trent?
The Punk match was ruined by his awful attire. Looked so funny. The stripes on the side did not work.
I'm not going to lie there are a couple of game changing move that makes a new Era last night was definitely one of them Adam Daniel etc its amazing to me that wwe let Cody go and he and the rest of the elite made a nightmare become a dream who knows where aew will be years from now no lie aew has made wrestling very exciting again
The longer the match went on, the better Punk got, the more the ring rust wore off, and the better the match got.
MJF is the best addition to wrestling since the WWE Attitude era. Best heel since Roddy Piper.
477! That’s a record!
nick’s hogan nwo moustache made me laugh so fucking hard that i had to pause the show to gather myself
ALL OUT. GETS A HUGE GOLDEN UP FROM ME.
When I watch WWE and AEW I'm always thinking I can't wait to see how Simon reacted to them and AEW's All Out... well there's so much to him to react to!
The best wrestling show of all time
Eddie Kingston V Miro - "the fans started to chant that he had made a mistake", no they said "YOU FUCKED UP!" at the top of their voices over and over!  Wonderful stuff!   the crowd was so INTO this match!  Also there was a GIVE THIS AN UP SIMON sign at the beginning of the PPV as well!  CONFIRMED - SIMON MILLAR IS ALL ELITE AND OPENED A PPV
Adam Cole Bay Bay
first pay per view AEW Ive watched and this show really does deserve a golden up
This is weird to write, but the Bucks have never beat the Lucha Bros at All Out 0-2
I rarely watch AEW. I don't dislike it or anything. And almost didn't watch All Out. But damn I glad I did watch it!
I was really hoping braun strowman would come out and clear the ring by beating all the elite up. Who can complain about getting bryan danielson though
“Maybe you didn’t like it, maybe you’re crazy”. Lmao
This might end up being Simon's most watched Ups and Downs in history.
the Best PPV all around. was " Awesome"
i watched the highlights last night and went omg i cant wait for simon to do ups and downs hes gonna go crazy
Early in the day: Youtube uncancels Simon Miller. Later in the day: "I really wanted more drugs injected in my system." - Simon Miller Tomorrow: Youtube cancels Simon Miller.
Also I love you Simon
This was the best thing in wrestling in our lifetimes my god
Awesome segment....lol
AEW is the best wrestling promotion in the world. This isn’t opinion it is 100% fact
You did a better job than Sedgwick in justifying Show/Marshall getting an up. Sedgwick basically said “this sucked, but it’s not a down, because this was AEW!!”  Omega/Christian was a bit disappointing, but this was a great show.
“Bad bits a down , yea right” I love you
Hmm... So AEW will become the new WWE if this continues. Meaning it will become the most popular wrestling program. It's pretty funny to think about since AEW is taking former WWE superstars that are influential and beloved so that it becomes well known around the world. I'm not saying that these superstars are WWE's property. They are free to do as they please with their lives and go do whatever they want with it. But I can't help but think that if these superstars wouldn't have returned, things would've played out much differently for the wrestling world. I feel like the only reason why AEW has a chance to overthrow WWE in terms of ratings is that former WWE superstars are now backing AEW up. What are your thoughts about this comment? If you're angry about this "outrageous" comment, go ahead and express it. I want to see how people would react to this and hear their thoughts.
ALL OUT is by far the coolest and best ppv of the year... Kuddos to AEW for putting smiles on wrestling fans around the world!
I heard what happened, watched the show at a friends place, and afterwards felt like WWE was dead to me. That normal?
WWE is too far gone with their ways. AEW is here to stay and that feels so damn good to say!
Me and the wife we're there MONEY well spent!! CHITOWN STAND-UP!!!
It was an okay PPV
Love the shirt Simon I have the same one but purple
Finally someone taps out to the Wall of Jericho lmao.
Highlight of my time on this channel is a tie between the “this is my reaction” moment 🤣 and when he said “I don’t care f*ck f*ck f*ck” lmao I died. What a PPV. Hats off to AEW for continuing to better wrestling
Did Adam Cole turn heel or stay heel?
It was a fun Ppv
QT should have eithrer pinned Paul White or given him a beating afterwards.  Paul White does not need to be put over, QT does.  He bullied Tony S., he has/had potential to be another top heel.... put the guy f*cking over.
I'm blessed as a fan right now.  Life is good.  And epstein didn't kill himself
Absolute greatest review of anything… ever. This review deserves a golden up!
Thank you for this Simon.  Just thank you.
Put Baker in the Elite lol
Jericho and MJF was an amazing match but the stipulation was unnecessary unless Jericho was gonna actually retire.
Ahh I missed it where can I go and watch it?? I am fairly new to wrestling and would like to know where I can watch AEW all out
I feel sorry for anyone who has to watch Raw tonight after this.
AEW did more with Ruby in one match that WWE did in years.
It's like an MCU movie...No, we can't leave...must sit through the credits...
Excellent video as always Simon!
Simon, if you ever came across this comment, please give me an UP!
It was absolutely amazing! An I just love there theme music it so dope an now I need there tee shirts in the near future
Aew All out
Simon the only thing better than All Out is your review of All Out. You get a golden up from me 👍
Genuinely All Out 2021 will go down as one of the best PPVs in Wrestling History
This was a Starcade/Wargames level Pay Per View!! Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!
His golden ups had a mind of its own. Lol.
Now did no one see rhe adam cole heel turn coming?
the greatest tag match I think I've ever sern.
Kojima is 50 years old? That man is rock solid. Respect. Now we get Suzuki vs Mox in Cincy this Wednesday!
Imagine Bray Wyatt in a program with Malakai Black. I really can see Wyndham take over the Dark Order. Reports are that Wyndham Rotunda really took Brody Lee's death hard.
this ppv, oh...my...god. tag team match was the best and the tnt match was surprising good too!
I give wwe 2 more years before things go downhill
To be fair, Miro did redeem Eddie's nuts in the end
Honestly since MITB 2011 in Chicago this was the best pay per view. My god.
MINORU! I LOVE IT!
If the post ppv interview didn't hit you in the feels especially the Ruby Soho segment then you are just cold hearted what an amazing time to be a wrestling fan !!
Yeah... this was the best PPV ever. ^_^
I already watched the ppv twice
I was there live last night and when Adam Cole came out it was crazy loud. When Bryan Danielson came out it blew the roof off! Such an amazing show and tag match should be up for match of the year! Honestly best PPV I may have ever seen!
Lmao the young bucks and Kenny the jobber are a massive down 😂😂
best ppv in the last ten years
Nick Jackson's Billy Graham beard tribute was fantastic
Just for fun us as viewers and fans should try making these a “Do Not Laugh Challenge” because I couldn’t make it past the 00:13 mark.  And with that said, I love the Ups & Downs episodes, and I can’t wait to finish it.
imagine, El Idolo Andrade vs Pac was not even happening, we would be at 500+ golden ups
It's so good to see wrestling fans like Simon beside themselves with happiness! This was a great, great show... He'll always be in Edge's shadow but I also think there is a very good argument to be made that Christian is a better in ring worker than Edge. He was amazing in the main event.
Lucha brothers vs young bucks the best match I have ever seen
PPV of the year maybe decade!  So glad Punk/Darby had a clean finish and nothing silly like 2.0 and Garcia interfering.
AEW brought ne back to wrestling. I hadn't watched wrestling since the attitude era. Thanks AEW for making wrestling enjoyable.
All Out was amazing
Cool shirt !!
AEW>WWE 😂
PPV of the year 2021, if it were to get beaten OMG what would that be like
I'd give it 1000 golden ups.  Cmon Simon... do better.
It's the first AEW PPV I really enjoyed. I don't particularly care for the style of some of their talent. It has turned me off in the past. But now they seem to have something for everyone. Lots of different styles on display. That really kept me interested the whole way through.
After that tag team match I wanted to take a nap. I was so excited for so long I was almost dead.
Cuz they are already DED ! * lights out *  .... guitar string  Catching flies ... in his mouth .... Tasting freedom ... while he dares
If I see one down, I will unsubscribe!
I wonder if wwe still think aew no threat, they probably going to fire more people as a result because that's what they do
BEST PAY PER VIEW EVER !!!!!!!! :)
I just realized Simon can be Johnny sins
I agree 100000000000%AEW,🤘🤘🤘👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,,,👍
Cm punk left through the heel tunnel
No matter which topic Simon is talking about, I just feel happy. BTW the show was awesome.
WOW when is the last time we had a clean sweep on the show? 😮😮
Best ppv I’ve watched for ages what a ride
This PPV...ticked all my boxes can Wednesday come tonight?!
The whole show was garbage
Incase AEW reads comments the only debut for them that would be bigger would be Simon. I think as a fan of what culture itd be amazing to see Simon in the ring and still getting to do the videos we love!!!
Aew sucks and please stop geting all wet for wwe rejects tna looklike
I still hope that styles and Ko are set free from wwe and join aew then join bullet club
He’s Brian Danielson not Daniel Bryant
Say whatever you want about AEW but that was a near perfect show *Chef kiss*
It was Awesome Bay! Bay!
14:42 Someone needs to tell Simon Miller that craters are holes in the ground, created by explosives or massive impacts. Craters don't "crash into Chicago" because they don't move. It would be a meteoroid that did that, not a crater.
AEW went from #2 to Officially #1 last night!!!
Simon being so overwhelmed with emotion and excitement that he can only muster dropping the f bomb, I love it.
This was an amazing PPV the best I ever saw,ido have some complain but nothing major,this is the ultimate PPV,great matches, not 1 or 2 but 3 good debuts what more can you ask for?
I was waiting all day to watch this PPV and it was literally the best one I've ever seen.  Amazing action and every return/debut I've ever wanted.  Can't wait for the future of AEW, they're going to destroy WWE!!!
Vince McMahon created 101 Youtube accounts to downvote this video.
I'm surprised he didn't mention the bad bump MJF got off the edge of the ring. That man was yelling in excruciating pain the rest of the match!
I'm so pissed that I didn't get tickets to watch it live and in person.  Flub me sidways, I'm a moron.
All Out 2021 was amazing hi Simon great videos man keep up the fantastic work.
I was like that F, F F, YOU FING joking. It was a orgasm I need a cigarette after watching this pay-per-view💯🤣
"omg my back, how am I going to sleep later?!" Lol awesome comment, Simon
🤣🤣🤣🤣 amazing. I almost ran into my door frame when Adam Cole came out
I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a wrestling PPV this much.
Miro did indeed redeem those nuts.
This PPV is the ending statement on the manifesto of why AEW is simply the best wrestling promotion in the world. I didn't go to the facilities from the time the buy in started to the time the show ended. I did not want to miss a moment. Wish some of the matches went another way, but they were so good that I didn't care. And that tag team match was simply the most wonderful thing I've ever seen!
So... WWE is dead, right?
tag mtch sucked luchas didnt deserve to win anything give golden up to adam and daniel who deserve
Any show where the Bucks go down is a great show 👍 🍊 👍
I am so happy Cm Punk returned when he did. I started watching AEW at that point now I’m invested in so many of these wrestlers
So glad I watched it. Fucking A to Tony Khan and AEW
The greatest take away from this in my mind is the pure look of joy in the faces of everyone who debuted. Those were some of the biggest smiles we've seen on them in a long time.
Penta being almost afraid to hug his daughters while spewing blood is a powerful takeaway from the cage match...
Pfffffffft
Tony Khan is the second coming of Jesus. Tony Khan is the man who is gonna make Wrestling popular again
AEW is the number one wrestling promotion in my opinion regardless of ratings and revenue WWE at this point is a watered down hasbeen promotion
Now AEW has become a great alternative to WWE!
where does simon get all these TMNT villain weight lifting shirts?
That PPV made me want to buy a Oxygen tank (It's a joke), because it was a mind blowing fist festival!
I don't think a wrestling show has made me feel like this since I was a child.
That cage match was insane! Over the past decade or two, I lost my love for wrestling. I figured I had just outgrown it.  Thank you AEW for making me feel like a kid.  I love wrestling... again. This was amazing.
ALLOUY Was  FIREEEEEEE!
Great show ever
One of the best wrestling PPVs of all-time. Easily.
Simon vs Gareth, Hair vs Hair!
And we love you too.
Your enthusiasm and excitement is so genuine. Great show by AEW again. They’ve broken your scoring system
“…and the bad bits a down. Haha, yeah right!” My thoughts exactly, my man.
Down for Riho being eliminated after rolling under the bottom rope.  Pretty freaking good show overall though!
This video, just like the PPV, made me feel warm and fuzzy in my tum tum, you sir don't just get a 👍🏻 you get a golden 👍
AEW>WWE... Smoked
I have one complaint, and only one- Paul Wight still sucks
I love Simon!
Aew is putting wwe in his pocket with ppv like this. for me it was a very very good show.
Just amazing
The only match I can say I genuinely disliked was Chris Jericho and MJF, and that’s only because the screwy finish kinda ruined it.
The only downs were that Skye Blue, Shida, and Rhio(which was a botch) deserved more time in the Battle Royal.
Reminds me of Hogan Hall Nash... Just gotta be able to maintain control with all that star power asking for control...
Nick hollywood hogan Jackson 😂🤣
Easily the best PPV I've ever seen. Easily the best tag team match Ive ever seen. I love AEW so much. Golden up
Simon none of this happened it's just a fever dream of yours
MJF should have won
the show could have started at the women's title match. Miro was too sloppy to be believable. 9/10
Here's what I think would've happened had Adam Cole joined the main roster:  Lands on Raw Has a feud with The Miz Put in a random tag team with Damian Priest or Ricochet Has a week-long US title reign Starts bringing a plastic baby to the ring, dubbed the Adam Cole Baybay Aforementioned baby gets possessed by Alexa Bliss and a feud ensues He loses to Lily on PPV Relegated to Main Event or 205 Live Released due to budget cuts, never once sniffing the main event scene
The intro
This was the greatest ppv I’ve ever witnessed
Sorry Simon but it is not one of the best PPV's ever. A solid one no doubt but it was far to predictable and did nothing to build homegrown talent. Instead castoffs are being made out to be huge deals. If they were that important the biggest Wrestling company in the world would not have gotten rid of them
Wwe are doomed,Vince has gotta be worrying now,all that needs to happen is for the fiend  to turn up and lead the dark order
Overall this Ppv made me warm & fuzzy in my tum tum. First time I purchased a ppv in over 15 years.
The best episode  so far, Simon you make me laugh hard your enthusiasm for the product is infectious, keep  up the good work and bring the  wizard in the sky
MLW, AEW, NWA it's when i watch their PPV that i find pleasure again in Professional Wrestling 😌.  AEW KILLED IT with this show.  Cole, Suzuki, Punk, Soho... 😢 That was Wonderful !!!
So, that's steel cage match... MOTY candidate?
I’ll go ahead and just say that this is the best PPV of all time. Start to finish was perfect.
One of the best PPVs I've ever seen
Don't like the music in thebackground.
Needed to make up like a 'Platinum up' after this one haha I was so pleasantly exhausted at the end of this show. Watching Simon do ups and downs for it made me feel all the feels all over again haha what a time to be alive. \m/
12 + 456 = 477?? Hmmm...
Simon Miller is the GOAT 🐐 every time man
I was at the show and there was never a moment when the crowd wasn’t raucous.   Paul Wight was probably the lowest point and that delivered.  The main event was just the crowd being tired and trying to save something for the big finish and boy howdy did it deliver
Thank you Simon
Sorry everyone I cant remember his name but there is a new well not that new mexican luchador who give you the vibe that he is Suzuki's reincarnation his a huge heavy hitter!
Aew: brings back cm punk  WWE: brings back Becky and Lesnar  Aew: and I took that personally
Yea seriously one of the best PPVs ever, and that ending… OMG THAT ENDING  and as soon as Adam Cole came out the heel tunnel I was like 🤔
This PPV was perfect from start to finish.  And yes I'll watch Raw tomorrow, and NXT and Rampage and Smackdown etc...   The AEW content is more enjoyable for me by leaps and bounds from WWE at the moment.  But that's the best part of all this.  They will hopefully keep pushing each other to improve on the content.  This isn't CNN and Fox News for crying out loud....it's ok to watch both!  I always have...always will regardless of which is more entertaining on "any given Sunday".
AFTER LAST NIGHT ENDING IM CONVINCED WE’RE IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.  NEVER WOULD I EVER IMAGINE RUBY. PUNK. PW. AC. AND BD ALL ON ONE CARD.
So Gay.
Is this the first event that's had zero downs?
'AEW is the Super Smash Bros of wrestling'   lol and I love it!!
477 golden up!? 🤯 Sorry WWE there's not coming back I'm sorry I had hope for your you WWE but it don't seem as off its going well
Simon, for once, you were almost lost for words.... 😁🤣 AEW really did knock it out of the park with ALL OUT!!! Ruby Soho, Adam Cole and Daniel..., Bryan Danielson all making their AEW debuts. WWE have it all to do to top this on the entertainment scale
All Out showed again why Jim Ross needs to retire.  He asked during the tag title match about who the legal men were.  IT WAS A CAGE MATCH!  He may be a legend but he has got to go!
AEW loves the fans and the talent.
This was the first aew ppv i bought, aew can take my month every 2 months.
Take a bow, AEW; you put on the PPV of 2021
When "All Out" ended, I just wanted to watch the Ups & Downs, to see Simons reaction to this masterpiece. It made the show even bigger.
I wonder if Vince is gonna let wrestlers have twitch streams now
Its always fun watching you praise AEW and then watch Jim Cornette shit on it.
YES! YES! YES!
I gotta be honest here. The Tag Match is getting SO overrated by people.   Like was it an exciting spectacle? At times, particularly the ending, but honestly I felt like it dragged a bit in the middle. I remember getting a bit bored before the last few minutes because it felt like empty calories, and I also felt like the production crew were having trouble shooting in and around the cage.   Honestly, my favorite parts of the match were the Lucha Bros entrance, and the part where AEW's tag team division got it's belts back from the Young Bucks. The match itself was just OK.
22:02 😂😂
This fever dream we all shared is the best thing in Pro wrestling since Jericho x Omega WK
A bunch of WWE guys show up again = best ppv ever! Lol.
I missed the ppv because I couldn't afford it wish there was a way to watch it without paying
Just throwing this out there, aubrey edwards is by far THE WORST ref ive ever seen...like, everything she does makes absolutely zero sense...ive seen bad reffing (the female ref on WWE who you can always hear telling the wrestlers their next moves john cena style), but this is like....bad to the point i cant focus on the wrestling
Simon that was the guitarist from Fozzy! That’s why it meant a little more to Jericho
Simon, this didn’t happen, is this a fantasy book?
That shirt! Where do I get one?!?!
That tag team championship match is easily my favorite of all time. And I saw the TLC match between the Dudleys, Edge and Christian, and the Hardys live.
IT  WAS THE BEST STORYTELLING AND WRESTLING I HAVE EVER SEEN.
This PPV melted your brain 🧠😂
I think Simon photoshopped all of this because there's no way this happened  As much grief (and deserved) tha AEW gets for their booking and flippy style, the PPV made up for it.  Now it needs to keep up the momentum
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I have to be honest it was one of the best PPVs that I've ever seen in my life 😲👏
WWE TAKE NOTES!!!
MJF is the best bastard in wrestling. Will not lie, I Marked out for his entrance and fucking loved every second of it lol
456+12 Up = 477 Golden up ..Great Math mate
I used to listen to a number of reviews on wrestling shows but the main reason you are the best in my opinion is because you come across as just a huge fan. You do not come across as a snob or in any way conceited about wrestling. Simon you are the best and I'll give you 50 golden ups. Keep it up my friend. Peace!!!
Incredible show
I don't see it being mentioned, but I liked that cheeky, sort of, tease of Punk's heel turn with the tunnel that he's gonna exit from. We all know it's too early for that but as Simon said before, "planting those seeds."
I absolutely lost my mind the moment I heard "Who's ready for story time with Adam Cole Bay Bay?!"
Also, AEW gets this massive boost from Punk's debut. And STILL DECIDES TO DEBUT COLE AND DANIELSON ON THE SAME NIGHT. All I can picture now is Ralph crying 'Stop, he's already dead', cause Raw is ☠️
Something tells me Simon really liked it....
So how on earth is aew going to keep all this talent in storylines and happy? At some point there’s too many egos to keep happy.
Fantastic showing. ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐
If you didn’t like that PPV you don’t know wrestling!
i'm still not wearing pants because I don't want the joy to end.
I was going to be sad if the ppv didn't get a golden up as  a whole
I haven’t watched a wrestling ppv since before Eddie passed away. This was my first ppv in a long time and I’m honestly back to being a wrestling fan! Holy smokes that was a show!
The only thing that I was upset about was the Paul vs QT match. There’s no two ways about it, when WWE books something like that with wrestler x and y we all want Vince’s head on a spike, but when AEW does it we love it
UP
Young Bucks vs. Lucha bros shouldn't have gotten a golden up....... give them boys a platinum up because that was insane
If wwe done some of this stuff it would have gotten some downs this guy has a hard on for aew that’s for sure but it is his show!!
How many time do I wanna watch the replay a lot
This show was perfect there was truly no match that fully sucked or was underwhelming. Even the Punk match yes in the beginning we had a slow build in momentum but once that match got going boom amazing. I mean even the Butchers return was great.  Well-fucking-done AEW.
Simon your awesome I really am enjoying the videos and aew is just taking over I think aew is my favorite show promotion now every since last year
This is seriously one of the best, if not the best, PPV I've ever seen. All the matches (except for Paul Wight and QT) were BANGERS and the 4 surprises were just the cherries on top.
Simmon the goat 🐐
Bryan Danielson
my tum tum was all nice and fuzzy for 5 hours
Holy shit the Lucha bros vs the young bucks had everything thrown at it including the kitchen sink. Epic!
I’m not even an AEW fan persay, and I’m hard pressed to think of a better viewing experience I’ve ever had watching a wrestling show.
I like AEW but when you’re booking Kenny omega to be the next Hogan and bad guys are always winning it’s kind of annoying and I know that some good guys just one titles but look how long it took him and see how long it’s gonna take them to lose to another heel stable
22:40 - This PPV broke Simon! LMAO
Aew is killing it! Great show and I can't wait to see what they do!
I was literally waiting for your ups and downs
Kenny omega be Christian shocker same old same old shit from AEW now
Saying Jericho got hit in the head and not that he got 'twonked'? Down Simon, down 🥺
If All Out was a good show ?????? Take my golden fuckin' UP !!! 👍
GOD BLESS TONY KHAN
THE BEST ppv in the last 10 years for me not including Japan. Just mindblowing
All I could think was how do they top this? This show was amazing
Up : everything  Down : we will see Goldberg champion in Saudi becasue that's what Vince thinks is a great response to All Out
That bit “Well my reaction is this:” got me laughing so hard for the shallowest reason. I love you Simon dammit
A modern wrestling show so good, even Jim Cornette gave it a 65%
This is what happens when you do things with entertainment in mind rather than sucking an old man's farts.
Darby Allin & Sting need to go to Impact and take the X division title.  The reaction Sting can get out of Impact
Lucha bros make every show worth watching always a golden up
This is a mark promotion
Best PPV I have ever seen! could have done without the Paul Wight match. The cage match blew my mind, but there were a few too many cute spots. Darby needs to gain weight.
All Out was phenomenal!!!!!!!!!!!! My first AEW ppv watch was a success… give that a Golden UP!!!!!
Perhaps a Platinum Up
Only down for me was the Bryce Remsburg stuff in the TNT match. It wasnt necessary and makes AEW look dumb for having ref shenanigans in two different matches
This is going to be one of the hardest PPV's to ever follow.  One of the best PPV's in over 20 yrs.  Still marking out and re-watching videos from last night.
AEW is the New Champion in Professional Wrestling. PERIOD!
477-0🤭
Just an amazing show how people can complain about any of this I’ll never know they are using all the indy stars that WWE ruined I love iy
No doubt about it Wrestling fan for decades and this was one of the best Wrestling Pay Per Views I have ever seen! Finally there is some REAL competition for WWE (Who really has to step up their game now - because last nights show made their product seem very stiff and tame in comparison.) The only area where AEW is  not quite on their level is in the Woman’s division - where they are honestly far behind WWE. But something tells me that this will be taken care of very soon! Amazing job last night AEW
Waiting on what Simon thinks of any wrestling show is next level goofy. I am that goofball.
Chicago is a lucky town, witnessing all the amazing debuts/returns
If you didnt like ALL OUT, you don't like wrestling.
Might be a wild prediction, but I feel like with the Super Elite being at 6 now, i can see down the line a split between them, leading to Omega and thr Good Brothers vs Cole and the Bucks
0:13 me too Simon
Simon, none of this actually happened, was this in some fantasy book you wrote?
Aew > Wwe at the moment!
And HHH called this a pissass company
Simon made my day with his reactions. Simon you definitely need a Golden 👆
Best ppv in years ... Lucha Brothers vs Young Bucks is the match of the year
If only Kenny omegas clan was ambushed by bray Wyatt while they retreated at the end 🤣
It was a great show, for sure. And WWE really shot themselves in the foot by letting all of this top talent go. AEW are singing these people and immediately having them make an impact and are inserted into meaningful srorylines/feuds.  And I'm going to be that guy and point out that the One Winged Angel was hit from Bret's rope, not the top. Still impressive.
I haven’t watched wrestling in years. Maybe it’s time to start watching AEW. Great video Simon👍👍
This is why wrestling is real to us. The vibe, the moments, the feels, it’s a time to truly be alive as a wrestling fan.
I hate to say it because I am a hardcore WWE Fan but after that pay-per-view last night I honestly think aew surpassed WWE they are in a whole nother level and I just don't know what Vince can possibly do to top on how great aew is right now I think it's kindly impossible
Simon curved us on his million dollar promise...is this a heel turn?
I was hoping Ruby and Thunder Rosa would fall at the same time and have Tony Khan come charging out and tearing both of his quads getting in the ring
$3?
I got to see MJF nearly crush my gf and Chris Jericho use our section divider as a weapon! Holy shit this show was unbelievable!!
WWE is dead if AEW keeps this up
The second the PPV was over my 1st thought was... how long until ups and downs?
Can't wait for Vince to come out sometime this week and state that the WWE isn't in the "wrasslin' business", but the Entertainment business.
Makes you wonder how WWE is going to catch up, throwing all their talent out the door, ruining NXT potentially .. with their sponsors shouting at them, Vince McMahon must have shit the bed after seeing this.
This was gay i wouldnt want my son watching aew watching cole let 2 dudes kiss him ill give this a golden gay
How disappointed is Simon going to feel having to watch WWE RAW after this bonkers show!!
That ppv was 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
We can't call him Daniel Bryan anymore, it's back to Bryan Danielson...
🎶Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho!!!🎶
When Bryan Danielson debuted I made the same noise Simon lol my fiancée looked at me all weird. This was the first PPV I’ve ever bought and damn AEW delivered.  Can’t wait to go to the Grand Slam Dynamite and then next month to the Dynamite in Boston  Ahhhhhh
BS attire looked like MVP lmao
We’re all thinking it, AEW is the top brand now, this All Out was the best wrestling show I’ve seen in over a decade, you could genuinely combine the last 10 wrestlemanias and they wouldn’t match up to the fun I had watching this. Tony Khan thank you, you’ve brought wrestling back and shock and awe the entertainment came with it. Bye bye vince you old decrepit fossil of a man.
Can we please not use WWE music and symbols for AEW related videos!
BTE is about to be amazing
The will go down as the shift in professional wrestling. all time ppv
All of Simon's predictions came true. Im going to need you to come to my house and choose me some lottery numbers... Because damn. How? Wow! We love you Simon! Lookimg like he didnt even go through a table last night
Describe AEW? Remember wrestling when you liked it?  Its like that but new.
Is it just me or is Dr. Brit Baker DMD someone who you would like to pick up in a bar and take home for the night?
15:33 Don't worry Simon, this is not the first time you've awarded 2 Golden Ups in the same video.  Probably the first time for 3 Golden Ups though!
Cristian Cage, Brian Danielson and CM Punk ...  Everyone in AEW has a crew... make them a crew for God's sake... debut the trio championships with them if u have to... it cannot have more prestige on debut if it's them
Simons wife after their wedding night : “how was it honey?” Simon: “it made me feel all warm and fuzzy in my tum tum”
I have never paid for a PPV or watched wrestling in over a decade. As a Chicago native, I HAD to come back for CM Punk. I am so glad I did because EACH match was AMAZING. I have never seen such talented wrestlers in all my years of watching wrestling. That cage match with the Lucha bros and Young Bucks was THE BEST match I have seen. Unreal performers all around. The crowd was so alive and made things 10x more engaging. Thank you AEW for bringing me back to my childhood!
AEW is way better then WWE
I love watching Simon. He's got so much enthusiasm. I wasn't a fan of AEW but they have brought in so many big names lately. I'm excited to see what they do next
Was an amazing PPV by AEW I mean who can complain about wrestling today? Like most wrestling fans WWE wa the place to be to see... but not now oh no the entire world is watching AEW now and its just a matter of time before they are the number 1 wrestling company in the world. And Vince can't buy them out this time
I absolutely agree. This pay per view was dare I say, phenomenal (potential spoiler???? doubt it but still lol).... All I know is I still don't like Kenny Omega but Adam Cole is professional wrestling so even though I was partially saddened by the heel turn because I want Omega V.S. Cole (I think we'll eventually get there...or at least hope that we do).
That was one of the best ppvs ever for sure, but this review was hands down THE BEST REVIEW EVER! I had such a great time watching this and feeling the emotion Simon was showing was just so great.  Thank you Simon!!!!
Simon I love you brother but lay of the l.s.d 🤣
10/10 best PVP ever
Greatest ppv I’ve ever seen. Easily. Nothing comes close. And Bryan cut a promo afterwards. It was great. It’s on YouTube. You should watch it.
Danielson lookin like a scale model Lesnar. How come we never saw DB shown as a badass, but always as a bit of a dweeb, if BD can come off so hardcore.
english man so happy after wrestling show he gives everyone one million dollars.
Bryan Danielson's speech after the ppv was awesome to be part of! I'm so flicking happy I got to experience that show live!
MJF’s selling of that back injury was top tier. I could feel that shit
AEW You nailed it 100%
AEW is the future of wrestling. This is huge for the business!
I woke up this morning in a haze and was like did last night really happen or was I dreaming
What an awesome PPV.
The thumbnail already deserves a golden up!
Golden up. Be looking for my sign on Wednesday in Cincinnati!!! Straight from BEECHMONT AVE!
We knew this show wouldn’t get any downs in certain. From the rematch to the wcw finish with Chris Jericho but hey whatever. No downs again. Enjoy y’all show 😜🙂
I don’t even watch AEW and I’m super stoked to watch this. I keep with the happenings though, and watched the debuts (outside of punks match) LETS GO!!
Guys, I had wrestlemania X7 vibes last night! Stacked card, the crowd was on FIRE, & all those surprises!
When wrestling is good it's great!  This was the best show of the year for sure.  Maybe (summons Wilborn) EVA!
Eric bissoff said mask wrestler cant show emotion properly n i choked when penta took the boot instead of rey fenix
Simon Miller....pffft.  thats the sound I made during this video.  Funny AF
Gotta say i love the remixed ride of the valkeries and i am also extremly happy that they went with it instead of the final countdown. I know he used the final countdown in the indies but because of cm punk you have allot of casual fans watching and his wwe theme will get the biggest reaction
you what the only thing that sucks about watching this ppv was? knowing Raw is on today lmaoo. what a downgrade thats gonna be
Tony Khan is the MAD HATTER of professional wrestling!!... And whenever he talks after shows he lets everybody know "you aint seen nothing yet"... just that right there blows my mind!
Its Official! Simon Miller is synonymous with Professional Wrestling!  Keep posting, I’ll keep watching! Great stuff always!
All out was amazing and I thought nothing could be better until I saw this Simon you are the BEST!!!!
R2 timing on the money he say!
AEW took it to the moon... Can't make a better show, IMPOSIBLE!
Danielson's post-show speech was pretty damn good, too
Ruby hugging the ref after her victory made my night
"Andrade and ohh Chavo" 🤣🤣💀
Aew doesn't need to beat wwe.. it needs to be profitable and exist in order to continue to give us these great shows. Coke has Pepsi  etc.
I thought the Monday night wars and attitude era/ECW will never be matched but AEW and Smackdown (Not you Raw) is killing it . AEW and the forbidden door and the most stacked roster since the 1996 Bulls is so entertaining. It’s about 100 dream matches that can be had in AEW right now then you have Impact and New Japan wrestlers showing up . This is amazing , only thing is the women division might suffer cause you only have so much time and AEW timing on their shows is already perfect where they don’t take up your whole night with 3 hour shows . But the work they have done so far is amazing . And we still have two more huge names out there waiting to be signed .
The cm punk and darby ending reminded me of when then young jeff hardy faced taker and at the end take was like,hey kid your got 'it' and will have a great future.Sting being there made it even better as he should have had that dream match w/take.The paul and qt match screen shot looks like a mortal kombat battle pic.Imo the best ppv in recent memory.I can only imagine how vince is and what he's thinking now.
Imagine being one of the 71 people who disliked this LOL
That was my reaction too. I was on my feet more than not. This reminded me why I love wrestling. Thank you to everyone at AEW! 10 star show from start to finish. Much love and respect to all the wrestlers.
What is wrong with the young bucks...ruined coles debut smh
No surprise the Young Bucks vs. Lucha Brothers get the Golden Up. Holy hell what an amazing match!
Darby Allin's ability to get over and get put over in defeat is truly amazing. The dude is incredible. Definitely my favorite guy in AEW and will go far in this business.
honestly aew to me is better than wwe for daybiews but not in returns
WWE is really helping AEW become real competition by letting all these stars go to AEW!….and I know they didn’t necessarily let them go but they could of paid them more or gave them bigger pushes and they wouldn’t of left WWE!
How many " Holy Shit" or "This is awesome" chants did you hear on Summerslam? Have you ever heard a "wwe" chant? This PPV made every wwe ppv look like nick at nite. AEW is wrestling and we love it. Best ppv, hands down!
Ruby's enterance brought a tear to my eye. She was treated so badly by WWE, gets a title shot as soon as she comes in the door of AEW, so deserved
That PPV was money well spent. Holy shit, what a great show. 👍🏼
AEW is beating the crap out of WWE right now and that ppv last night was a tombstone to wwe
That tag team cage match was some goooooodddddd shhhhiiiiii
An alien humanoid could only be stronger than a regular human if the alien's planet had a heavier gravity than Earth. For fucks sake Miller,  do I have to explain everything...
Well, well, well. All Out certainly lived up to it's name 🤭 I mean they held nothing back and everyone is happy they didn't 😁
He got his R2 right on the money lol
Best wrestling pay-per-view ever
Such a great show, I reckon the crowd deserves an up too.
The whole PPV was great the matches the suprising debuts
Chicago is wrestling city 🔥🔥
2 more eric Rowan and bray wyatt
As much as I like Christian Cage, could you have imagined this card with a Hangman Omega main event on top of everything
Nothing to do with the show but can we please get CM Punk Vs KENTA GTS Vs GTS
We are gathered here today to mourn the official, signed, sealed and delivered passing of WWE. Type F to pay ur respects.
First pay per view I have ever bought and I regret none of it. The cage match was amazing and the bait and switch at the end was great.
I think AEW all out broke Simon Miller his system and him but I have never seen him so happy
456 golden UPS you added nine extra to that number but I'll allow it
Love watching big sweaty man meat beat the shib outta each other
Just a little detail on the Jericho/MJF match. The second ref didn't come from the back; he was already there because the attempted run-in by Wardlow happened seconds before. Small but important detail for various reasons.
This was the first time in a LONG time I was so into these matches I was SCREAMING. LOL!!! That lucha bros match was absolutely gorgeous. That was my highlight.
I was so sure that Simon would be so hyped about this show. What AEW offered us yesterday was amazing!
69 people are WWE only fans 😳😜
Was it perfect?  No.  Was it the best PPV AEW has put out yet?  Yes   Does it make me hope and wish WWE steps their game up? Yes.  Was it the best PPV any company has had in an extraordinarily long time?  I believe so.  Am I done asking dumb questions and answering them myself?  Not sure.
Yeah, you did every single thing you had to do there. Sure did.
All out just obliterated summetslam, raw nxt and smack down for the next 7 years with this amount of ups
Best show that I've ever watched  Btw, Simon, I'm gonna give you a Down because you don't want to give me 1 million dollas :(
Two golden ups in one show WHAT?
According to Taz and Excaliber if you watch dark they proved that the apron is NOT the hardest part of the ring... its the ring post
Simon and neil de grass tyson should have a debate about big numbers
Amazing show
None of this actually happened
If ever an entire show deserved a golden up, it's this one. Holy balls.
MY CUP RUNNETH OVER!!!  Also: Did you cought the moment when Ruby says: "Hi Bryce!" to Bryce? :D
YouTube should implement a golden up icon on this show so we can all click it.
Danielson should have come out to final countdown other than that it was a great show
I I felt like I was watching Bruce Springsteen concert Bruce Springsteen concert who's watching who's watching all out can't wait to be in person Aew either a dynamite or Rampage or pay-per-view
Aew just keep burying MJF tho
It was a decent show. Nothing special or to brag about but Adam Cole should have debuted a few weeks down the like because the American dragons debut overshadowed his by a mile
kinda getting old with all this...pac not wrestling...visa or not...
No downs… sure.
Just thinking bout how the fans went home so disappointed after summer slam and how excited the fans went home after All Out is night and day…
If WWE needed a bigger kick in the balls, this was it. When u release all of ur stars and dont give the fans what they want, the competition will take advantage. AEW is taking full advantage, and the results were shown in this PPV. Pro wrestling is what the people want. Thankfully AEW is bringing it back for us. Wish WWE would do the same, but Im afraid nothing's gonna change until VKM is permanently out of the picture.
Spot On! Everything you said Spot On!
This deserves a golden like
Mjf is one of the best heels in recent memory cuz I can't stand that asshole
i trust AEW.  i felt genuinely blessed watching that ppv.
Simon’s reaction actually made me care about this.
Imagine being Adam Cole you had your big moment and debut in new Company and within 5 min you are sidelined and got kicked out of place.  Glad that he and Bryan are in AEW and they had phenomenal PPV, before watching video I am sure this PPV will get Golden Up also tag title match too.
Would Brit baker using her Opponent’s own hand to apply the lockjaw work?
Best PPV ive ever seen. It was even better than 12 year old me convincing my dad to buy wrestlemania x8 just to see the rock vs hogan. This blew that out of the water. Move over WWE there is a new wrestling business on top!
Hell yea couldn't agree with you more Simon phenomenal card. And a Big up to Simon for the genuine review
Cm punk Vs KENTA winner keeps GTS lol
Ima be honest i only know whats going on with wrestling because of your videos you honestly made me remember what i love about wrestling
This episode of Ups and Downs gets a Golden Up!
Simon Adam did come out of the heel tunnel lol
Just went to look what wrestlers kept/left their ring name pre/post wwe and no vids came up soooooo that could be a good video idea for y’all
bias if it was wwe egg head would give it all downs
Amazing show
This needs a golden thumbs up
Adam Cole sucks.
This ppv was the greatest of all time. I still love wwe but this ppv had everything
Match between Punk vs Darby was good but didn't deserve Golden up.
I give your review 477 golden ups, last nights show gave me the big feels too!
Greatest wrestling ppv in quite some time.  All Out 2021 >>>> Last 3 Wrestlemanias combined
WWE fanboys disliking the video is pure gold
Simon "you son of a bitch" Miller - YOU GET A FREAKING UP! 👍 thank you, you are a key component for giving me life back into Wrestling and I'm All Elite!!!
The most insane wrestling show of all time!!!!!!!
This video just wrapped everything up in a nice little bow for me. Now I can finally sow my jaw shut again😆🔨
Aew: kills children  Simon milller: up
Ruby Soho = the Molly Holly of this generation ❤
Best thing after watching a pay per view is watching ups nd downs hosted by Simon Miller.
When was the last time WWE got 12 ups(3 golden) and 0 downs?  AEW>WWE
Jericho vs mjf was my favourite match of the night. I may have disturbed my roommates by screaming “tap you Bitch, tap” and I jumped out of my chair when mjf tapped out. What a match, what a pay-per-view
Ups from AEW All Out: everything  Downs from AEW All Out: nothing  😁👍
I can understand the criticism towards the ref putting the turnbuckle pad back on.  AEW's refs are beyond a shadow of a doubt the worst and most useless refs the industry has ever seen and most of the time the refs just stand there looking like they don't even know where they are.  In any other situation, AEW's refs would have just stood there pointing at the turnbuckle pad like they've never seen one before.
The best ppv in years, if not decades. AEW is now the premier wrestling organisation on the planet. Bye bye wwe.
What a great time to be a wrestling fan, I enjoy watching AEW and I enjoy watching WWE. My life is just getting better and better.
why does the ELITE has to be apart of 90% of the storylines on dynamite it ruins the whole show, every match they makes there refs look like complete idiots, constant run ins, the booking is horrible how do aew honestly expect to compete with wwe when they cater to there niche audience that’s 90% indy fans n wwe haters
(I hate to be that guy but unfortunately it needs to be said) but All Out was honestly a perfect PPV & it’s kinda hilarious how we are going to go from that…to Monday Night Raw in the span of 24hrs.
What can I say chef's kiss this was probably the best PPV I've ever seen.
so many golden ups I'll add one more for Simon Miller
Adam Cole made the right choice
Aew is moving like the Lakers rn
This was the first aew ppv I had the money to get and omg I feel like I just watched wrestling history
Simon's little dance when talking about Adam Cole nearly made me cry laughing
No downs?? Somebody's angling for a job in AEW
First aew ppv where I watched every match. That cage match set the tone for me damn those guys are good especially the Lucha Bros!!
Simon, did you notice that in the Britt and Statlander match, Britt had Stat in the crossface hold too? Another Tease that was real
Golden down QT lost
AEW at least has a good enough roster now to compete with WWE. Maybe it's just me, but I find all the fan participation annoying and distracting. Rather than just going and enjoying the show, they want to start stupid chants like, "holy sh..." and play sing-along with the theme music. I don't remember The Attitude Era needing validation from the fans. It was enough just watching the shows, buying tickets, and buying merch rather than needing to hijack the show and make it about them.  If it was really awesome, you probably wouldn't need to chant, "this is awesome." All the little marks in the crowd knew DB and Adam Cole were set to debut, so is it really a, "holy sh..." moment?
Riho was never eliminated. I mean, she was never going to win, but she was the first ever women's champion. Gotta give her some respect.
The only down (and only a small one at that) for me was Riho's sudden and clearly botched elimination. She went under the rope!!! Even heel Jamie Hayter wasn't pleased.
I wish you did a reaction show
Best PPV ever hands down
Simon never disappoints love ya Edit: damn that t-shirt is clean
Simon, Mikey Rukus did such an amazing job last night, with his little private concert for the Lucha Bros, that made that match that much more special.  Now you add, Billy Grey, the actual man who wrote Judas, and told Jericho to use this song as his ring entrance, you have something special for many performers.
was expecting Tanahashi, got Minoru. I regret nothing. All Out was the first time in ages when a wrestling ppv got me suspend my rationality and try to predict the show, and just appreciate it as a fan. It's disappointed that the fans were not as much into the main event as it deserved, but, by then they were probably exhausted.
I love you Ninja Turtles shirts! Where do you get them Simon?…..I’m a huge TMNT fan since I was kid in 80s!
Simon, you're the best ! We're in this together, this crazy world we call professional wrestling. This is an era defining moment, prepare your golden ups, this shit will be raining aplenty soon !
come on, that paul wight match was a down. still doesn't take away from the overall PPV though, amazing
you know the ppv was fantastic when you get hyped again from some dude just recapping it.
AEW and it’s fans give off that attitude era feeling, no kids just vibes
Simone none of this actually happened was this in some weird fantasy book that you wrote?
That wasn't just some guy for Jericho's entrance that was his guitarist from his band Fozzy
AEW Truely went ALL OUT... hope this sets a trend for future ALL OUT shows
It was all UPS for me and the gang. All Out was definitely top 5 PPV’s
The lucha Bros match was the best for me, first because I'm Mexican and I love their style and second because of the theme of the match, the whole family is important thing was amazing, starting with the entrance of the lucha bros then two teams of brothers fighting for a championship, Penta blocking the kick to Fenix and after they won he celebrated with his daughters and wife I think, totally amazing stuff, I could watch it all day
I had plans already scheduled for Sunday night so I missed All Out, but I promise to look for a way to buy a replay and watch this. I’ve never bought any PPV before this year, especially wrestling. But I’m convinced I need to watch this show. I kept up with AEW in the beginning but I was so used to watching just highlights I couldn’t watch more than the first few episodes in full. But now? I gotta watch the whole show and I haven’t done that in years. Thank you AEW.
I can't imagine anyone in good faith not thinking All Out wasn't at least great.
i think Darby Allin is going to turn heel soon everyone new that comes into the company want to fight Darby and he keeps losing, i smell a heel turn.
Best.play-per-view.ever.
I really hope aew can actually keep all these ppl happy and not mess it up.... it's really hard to juggle all these wrestlers and keep them in the main event where they deserve to be.... look at wwe.
I can't say it enough.  AEW womens division is becoming strong! That was a weak point to haters early on, and for good reason. But now that division is much stronger. So if you're still an AEW hater you aren't a true wrestling fan or you're not willing to embrace the present and let go of the past!!!
The beginning gets 1 down to slow , the rest agreed thumbs up
Young bucks vs lucha brother's was epic match
"SoMe GuY pLaYiNg GuItAR dUrInG hIs EnTrAnCe"  Man, imagine if you did 4 seconds of research before you shot this video. 🤷‍♂️
This was the Very best Ppv ever and I love if
Daniel Bryan Danielson
Well.......at least WWE has *HAPPY CORBIN × NIKKI A.S.H × Alexa & Lilly* and now a "heel" *Becky Lynch* 🙃..... Lmao 😂 shits sad AF bruh 😩😭
I didn't even get to watch this pay per view but just watching this recap makes me feel like this is one of the most awesome things I would have seen in a long time!
My first AEW ppv & im glad it was!
I meet you years ago at Eurogamer when you were working for 2K - I remember telling you you’re awesome and marked out a little over the old reviewsicles -which I think confused the dude trying to interview you 🤣 keep up the good work duder
Anyone else notice the genuine smiles on all the wrestlers! They are back in love with their craft at AEW!  What a great product! As a life long fan, thank you AEW
Oh that was icing on the cake!  I went to bed so late I was up early because I had to check reactions all day.  Wrestling has become so awesome!
I seriously hope Rampage can get two hours at some point, with the roster being as big as it is, you'll need time for everyone to get some shine. As much as I love Jurassic Express and The Acclaimed I think other talent could use some exposure as well, if it wasn't for Platinum Max making that ridiculous rap the acclaimed would be on every week, but then again his burns prior to then was absolutely vicious lol
Aew is the best wrestling promotion rn. What I love about this Company is that we get to see guys who are actually themselves and allowed to show us their craft. Where in wwe they act like they never seen or heard of the person who shows up or when getting called up.  Aew has interested me in each and everyone of their ppl on the roster
All Out was the best wrestling PPV since Wrestlemania 17.  Fight me
The forbidden soir frame. Let's be honest, the door is litteraly unhinged.
remember, adam cole is smart. he might be just running a long con to have his revenge.
Why not just watch wwe and see all your stars from the beginning?
Sounds nuts but gadamn i can't wait for the AEW wrestling game. Its gonna be so epic. The roster is insane (especially now), the folks who made No Mercy are making it, and its AEW!!!😳🤯😵 put it in my veeeeeeiiiins.
did anyone else think that this crowd kind of sucked
These guys better be using fakes for that spot cuz damn it if he used the brand new 5,000 Travis Scott’s he deserves to be kicked with them things his self
Jim cornette Stans are gonna hate this video 😂😂😂😂
22:03 pure happiness
"The whole show is getting a golden up! I know I completely obliterated my system, but AEW has completely obliterated all the rules" - Simon ....I see no problem here 😁
That was one of the craziest pay-per- views and the greatest ever
Knew Jericho was going over when. I realized MJF was wearing the red Flair gear.
man, i could listen to simon talk for hours maybe even days
I guess it's safe to say that *Miro* redeemed those nuts.................... Lmaooo 😂
The only complain I have with All out is usage of same dynamite arena for this awesome ppv.
Imagine watching monday night raw after seeing this 🤣
"He had some guy playing the guitar..." that guy was the guitarist from Fozzy
First pay per view I ordered in over 20 years and was so happy I choose wisely!! Platinum up!
First time I’ve brought an AEW PPV, I don’t really watch it but follow what happens. Could spare £15 to see Punks return and wasn’t disappointed by the rest of the card.
AEW PPV's start at 8PM EST and end when Simon gives his Ups and Downs.
Simon, I like your Karion Kross shirt
the best night of wrestling I have ever seen amazing booking just amazing Tony Kahn thanks for making me a wrestling fan again and keep up the good work on this video
Best PPV of the year. AEW KILLED WWE WITH ADAM COLE AND BRYAN
"Some guy playing guitar?" I'm not that familiar with Fozzy, but I'm pretty sure they said his name and that he was the guitarist for the band. But... yea. Some guy. lol
All the wwe rejects buried all their aew originals its tna all over again lol 😂
The only down I would give is to Bleacher Report. I missed the first hour because I couldn't get the player to load on my computer. I eventually watched what I could on my phone. I'm still waiting to hear from B/R tech support by the way.
“Of course he power bombed Orange Cassidy. He’s a piece of fruit. He can’t sell him in his shop.” 😂 idk why I died of laughter. This is me typing from beyond the grave 👻
Definetly the best if not one of the best pay per views in the last decade
This was insane!! I have a wrestling man crush on Tony Khan, he is bringing all my wrestling dreams come true
Professional Wrestling is currently in a *Great Space* 🤞 💯 🏁
sold out 👎🏿
Simon, none of this actually happened. Was this in some weird fantasy book that you wrote?
This show made me fall in love with wrestling all over again. I genuinely haven’t felt that in years. I haven’t watched Raw, Smackdown, or NXT consistently since probably 2017. But this just brought a feeling of complete and utter satisfaction and happiness that I can’t ignore. I’m genuinely concerned for WWE and if they can ever come back from it. If they weren’t terrified before, they definitely are now.
The whole show deserved the golden up
One of the best PPVs I’ve ever seen. $50 felt like a steal for what we got. AEW is now my first choice for Pro Wrestling.
First time buying a pay-per-view in over 20 plus years and it was so worth it
Dream match lucha bros vs the uso
Greatest wrestling ppv ever!
Simon, your ability to give a different analogy to how each match made you all warm and fuzzy in your tummy  is Top Notch Sir. You are why I subscribed to this channel
Best PPV of the year. Including all the promotions.
I am ok with the scoring system on this one.  I was "Holy S**T" the entire last 10 mins.  Incredible PPV. Now where is my million bucks?
I think aew just burned it down. Great show!
Ummmmm Simon what are you on about, none of this happened. Were you having some kind of fever dream?
TK needs to get The Final Countdown for Danielson
Simons TMNT tee shirt collection is something to behold
I actually thought this was one of their worst PPVs... i dunno, maybe it was just my expectations, but everything just sorta played out how I anticipated them to, with nothing other than (arguably) the worst match of the night (QT & PW) surpassing my expectations...
And wwe will dedicate a combined 5 hours of women’s wrestling and promos on each of their shows this week. WWE is finished
will anybody talk about punk's new gear?
Crazy good show. How is WWE gonna top this PPV, tonight?........Oh yeah, they can't!!---->Fact! 🤣
Immediately after THE MOST ELECTRIFYING SPORTS ENTERTAINER IN ALL OF YOUTUBE posted this video - WWE countered by posting a Hamptons Hard core match with Dolph Ziggler vs. Damian Sandow 😐 - I'm buying the AEW re-play
best ppv of aew history
My names Simon and WWE wouldn’t spit on me but the money mark might… give it an up
september 5th 2021 will always be remembered as The day simon and all wrestling fans who witnessed this, lost their mind!!
Simon..you had me in tears at the end there. I didn't know wether to laugh or cry at your reactions and what you were saying. Give yourself a golden up.
Honestly that PPV was so good overall that I might buy the DVD of it when it comes out
you should consider making a Diamond UP for special occasion like this
I had hoped they just would go totally all out and have Cole, Bryan, Wyatt, IIconics & Ruby show up during the show, so I kinda got a 3 out of 5 and I still have the hardest wrestling boner ever known to mankind.    Pissing & etc etc does however hurt as heck now, everything is diamonds and they dont flow well.
The only bad thing about this show is HOW are they ever going to top this???
All out was amazing the best ppv of the year
AEW is 🔥🔥🔥 right now
I beg to differ on one thing. Miro didn't hit Kingston in the balls, he redeemed those nutz.
I couldn’t sleep last night, that how awesome AEW is 😭😭💜🥺
The only match I could see ever getting a down would be QT Marshall vs Paul Wight, and even that was kept very brief so its hard to give it a down.
Simon's presentation style has changed quite a lot over time it think. He's more animated, and it surely is tied in with his wrasslin' gig. Just an observation.
AeW 👽 speciality is using underutilized wwe roster (mostly)
Rest In Peace WWE. you have really fucked up letting all this talent slip out of your hands. This PPV was one of the best in years. Simon you do a fantastic job keep up the good work!
I don't think I can remember a time I've felt more excited as a wrestling fan. I like WWE but it's sports entertainment and they are good at that, mostly. I wasn't always a fan of AEW but man they do wrestling so well. This is the 1st ppv in a long time where there wasnt a midcard lull. Every match felt absolutely important and told a great story. The ending just sent chill up my spine. They reaiiy pulled it All Out this ppv the only thing they need to wonder is how to yop this one. If they do I better have my will made up because I might just die lol
Best 52$$ i have ever spent  AEW dynomite is going to be off the chain this week
Simon….you get a golden 🆙
I tweeted you to give the tag match a GOLDEN UP and before I watch it I'm saying now again IT BETTER GET A GOLDEN UP
All Out really took its name literally
Expected most of the surprises, BUT Minoru Suzuki showing up got me good. I never expected it. It was awesome!!
Does anyone know the easiest way to watch rampage and dynamite in Canada? I tried FITE but apparently that’s not available in my area
Probably the best PPV I’ve seen since 2011 and or 2006. Wow.
Young bucks vs Lucha Brothers and arrival of Cole and Punk was so awesome. Punk match was decent rest of the show was fine. Just watched Jericho vs MJF match great story telling and match second best match of the show.
You forgot to add the Kojima highlight lol
Thumbs downs coming from WWE fanboys who didn't even watch the show I'm guessing...
cm punk buries younger talent like darby shows punk is all about punk.
Aew needs to sign Simon
They truly went ALL OUT for this PPV.
I was already into AEW, but this Show made me fall in love!
I "Oh Flub" 'd out loud, at the Adam Cole reveal.  If you watch the after show press junkets, with Ruby, Adam & Brian: Tony is sitting there, wide-eyed, like a fan that can't believe he is sitting there.
WWE is done.
Who else was bumping Daniel's music when he came out!
AEW is smart. They're still protecting MJF with that finish. He now still has an excuse when he claims to be undefeated.
all out was one of the best pro wrestling shows of all time.
U forgot about jon moxlys macth???
Moxley defeated Cardona for the GCW Championship, confronted Gage, went somewhere else to defeat Kojima, then traded shots with Suzuki in a 24-hour period. Mox is the real workhorse. Dude really will wrestle anybody anywhere.
Christian, Daniel Bryan, Jurassic Express the Next new super stable!
How the hell are you gonna pick an mvp this week
Popped from start to finish. I love pro wrestling and it's time to shake things up!
All I kept thinking throughout the show was, I can't wait to see what Simon has to say
According to Meltzer, they put the Q.T/Paul Wight there because if matches went over, they could cut the match from PPV.
Kenny Omega really is one of the absolute best wrestlers in the world
Minor nitpick but the final up count should be 467.
Aew is just wrestlers who couldn’t hang in the wwe. How many tryouts did the Young Bucks have? Kenny Omega? How many fired wwe wrestlers crawl their way into this shit production?
I never agreed with Eddie Kingston getting a title shot at this pay-per-view or a title shot at all for that matter but the match wasn't half bad at all the only thing I didn't really like was the ending it was really stupid it didn't help either one of them I was rooting for Miro but even I felt bad after he won because of how bad the ending was booked
This was the final nail in the coffin for me and a lot of WWE fans who actually enjoy Wrestling. I cancelled my peacock subscription which doesnt even update it with the live shows. Traditional wrestling fans will go to AEW, WWE is geared toward "Entertainment" AEW is a wrestling purists dream.
Best $50 I've ever spent. That show was Amazing...Yes Yes Yes☝👆☝👆☝👆
When mjf did his entrance i literally said out loud “what an asshole” cause i popped for the countdown
Simon is very shiny today
A distraction finish is a distraction finish no matter the gimmick.
I need to calm the hell down. Absolutely outstanding ppv. Wow just wow
Simon so excited he will join aew   Confirmed
Best PPV of the year and one of the best wrestling PPVs ever.
Johney sins
AEW just broke Simon's system 😂😂😂
Simon what’s this weird fantasy novel you’ve wrote. None of this is real. (You told me to do it)
22:02 me when adam cole debuted..
Feel bad for paul white.I love him but ppl seem to despise him. He's great
Can’t believe you didn’t mention that chop and super kick spot
Lets see how vince trys to one up this cause he needs something i didnt order it last night but i prolly will next one cause they give u a good feeling for spending ur money !!
𝕲𝖔𝖑𝖉𝖊𝖓 𝖀𝖕
I have never known perfection, this PPV was bloody close! Loved it all!
Best ppv ever
The Paul Wight segment should be a down but the only down of the whole show. The rest is pretty much a golden up.
I think it's safe to say that AEW is going to be around for awhile. WWE better be scared.
All Out was AMAZING! This following after, just the same. Thank you Tony👏👏  👏👏👏 Thank you Simon 👏👏. 👏👏👏
Personally with everything aew is doing wwe is gonna go the way of wcw
All Out 2021 was Pro Wrestling done to perfection in every aspect possible.
Had some dude playing his song lol.its hes from chris jerichos band  simon
👍
All Out >>>>> Summer Slam
Normally I feel like Simon over hyped these AEW shows but for once this show actually deserved all the hype this show was literally just fucking wild and I can honestly say I haven’t felt this excited watching a wrestling anything in a looooong time and that’s not an over exaggeration
Hopefully Dave Meltzer gives this PPV 6⭐️
Was far from one of the best PPV ever...
Not AEW’s biggest fan but this PPV was really good. Credit where credit is due.
Hangman can beat Kenny for the title
Simon's tangents are giving me life!
That Thumbnail tho It looks like something out of a fandom.
Such a good PPV !
I forgot about the Paul Wight match too but I think he was literally late. He did the 7th inning stretch at the Cubs game, and you know Chicago traffic
Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed the birth of the Golden Age of AEW
AEW All Out 2022: Simon Miller debuts with WHY Chants... and then later we get our first ups and down from locker room
Tony Khan is a mf genius, AEW is hands down the best company right now & them working that forbidden door
Never paid for a ppv, but this had so much promise that I couldn't resist paying for the 1st time ever.   WWE could never win my interest enough to invest especially after what they did to Bret Hart many years ago, and I stopped watching after that.
3:49 over and over
I'd almost forgotten how much fun it could be, being a wrestling fan. Fantastic show.
The Title of the video should be Ups and More Ups from AEW All Out
Best pay per view ever
I don't know what was better that pay-per-view or your shirt!
I think AEW has the rights to the Bullet Club branding so if they wanted to bring back the Bullet Club, they could since they are partners with NJPW now and for some reason I could see that happening because of the faction reuniting with each other one by one. Let's make it happen AEW🙏🏻
No downs!? Wow!!
if you saw that live last night you were some of the lucky ones to be apart of that moment in time. insane pops all fucking night. i feel like a kid again watching this shit
Thanks to AEW tonight on Raw Undertaker is coming out of retirement to fight Lashley for the world title lmao.
So sad I don't have cable and the money to watch it because as someone who was a fan of wrestling but stopped watching around 2010 but has come back since AEW has shown up. I would have lost my mind cheering at home like I did years ago
How was the Tag Team Championship match so far down the card?
Imagine if Cole pulled his head back from that thumbnail...🤣🤣
WWE ain't fuckin with AEW! PERIODT!
That was an incredible ppv. It was great start to finish. I haven't seen a ppv that good in a very, very long time.
Awsome couldnt agree more with u mate!!
Ruby Soho just stole her name froma rancid song lol also Simon Simon Simon! also yes yes yes yes
Meanwhile in WWE. Spear Spear Spear , Superman punch , Spear, Guillotine choke ,Spear.
10/10 PPV
No chance in hell McMahon liked it lol
I was crying when I thought Jericho lost.
Jericho burred mjf for no reason at all .
AEW is like the alternative new death row records of todays new professional wrestling nowadays
love the possitivity cant wait for a professional like cornette to release an actual review tho 💯
Yay Daniel Bryan has finally separated from WWE I am so glad I never have to see him again’! I just watch your recaps for roster updates as I refuse to watch AEW.
Adam Cole was already a heel, he came out of the heel tunnel.
My favorite ppv ever
I've never seen so much positivity in a video. Keep up the great work Simon 👍
Best Show Ever or close I stayed up late slept 4 hours to come to work and even watch it again LOL
Miro won by pinfall with a thrust kick. It's ok we're all human we make mistakes Simon
"AEW is the super smash brothers of wrestling" that is the best analogy.
Gave the fans so much, great matches, great storytelling, unbelievable action, CM punk wrestling after 7 years, a new womens division badass and my god that ending was just majic. Very possibly the best PPV I have ever seen.
You know a shows good when you click Ups and Downs and you're like "I wonder which segment got the Golden Up"
WHAT A WONDERFULL SHOW ! WHAT A COMPANY .  I'm ALL ELITE FOR GOOD NOW
I bet that wwe has a response for this show. Since nxt is going Nickelodeon, they will announce their new ppv show, All That. 😂😂😂
It was a Monday morning 7am show here in Malaysia, but who cares. What a treat it was
Legit had to check my video playback speed
The best pro wrestling PPV of 2021!
Hangman Page vs All These guys is gonna be awesome! I think Page Vs Bray will be Brays 1st feud because of the dark order!
Amazing show! The only down was Danielson's entrance music. Hope they redo it asap
If you think about it, "if ya smelllllllllll......." was about the only thing missing from this PPV Simon :D
This was AWESOME
Brilliant PPV, one of the best but am I the only one that thought the cm punk match was a snore fest? If it wasn't for the nostalgia chants from the crowd it would have totally sucked
The only ups are Adam cole,Bryan, and the new tag champs the rest of the show sucked
Best PPV ive seen in years
This ppv had to be top tier
I’m hoping Bray comes and forms a heel stable with Lance Archer and Jake the Snake. “The Deranged Dynasty” . Their pairing along would be legendarily scary!!!
Aew sucks
I made a fan of my roommate this show was absolutely incredible
The ending was so awesome even my 5 year old was screaming YES YES YES
AEW is giving us the WWE we always wanted
sunday was a statement. period. the superior company has spoken.
I was done when Minoru Suzuki came out. But then AEW just kept giving it to me last night. I'm exhausted. 10/10
Lucha Bros Tag Team Champs was a dream come true for me as they are my favourite tag team of all time and that means they beat out the likes of the Dudley Boyz
I was one of those people who couldn’t wait to see your reaction
Hey Simon just a suggestion but maybe you can add the diamond or platinum ups to your scale for ppvs like this one
The tag team cage match was the highlight. I was exhausted just watching it.  Cole embracing the Elite was predictable though his appearance was not. Neither was DB's return. Never thought we'd get two major debuts one after the other.  The show was WELL worth the 50 bucks!
He was asleep
I missed Simon last night he wasn’t tweeting
.kenny is such a dipshit, i love him
All out 2021 greatest ppv in 20 years  round of applause👏 all around 👏
WWE TAKE NOTES!
I'd love to hear Vince McMahon's take on  the pay per view. Only changes I'd have made was Thunder Rosa should have won and QT should have won. Still my favorite ppv maybe ever.
AEW burying WWE now..    First Christian , then Jericho, then CM Punk himself(!!!!!)and now Brian Danielson and adam cole!  Bring Christians best buddy and his current tag team partners over from WWE and  WWE will drown themselves..   Seriously, thanks to AEW  Pros wrestling is back and  All Out was one of the best ppvs EVER!  So just imagine the aforementioned Christians buddy and his current tag team partners also shipping to AEW  For those who don't understand I'm talking abt EDGE and REY MYSTERIO!
Ruby's smile filled my heart with joy when she walked out, when she won and gave the ref a hug after confirming she won brought tears to my eyes, was superb
Goodbye Vince. You got nothing left.
This is the beginning of a new era, wrestling is never gonna be the same ever again
I really wonder Vinnie Mac's morning is going?
all out went all out
Best PPV I've seen in decades, AEW is killing it, what a time to be a wrestling fan.
Not a single down. Definitely an amazing show
I saw this in theaters and a good amount of people came out. It was so much fun and we all lost our shit during the the whole ppv, especially the returns/debuts.
I got my mom to start watching AEW just a few weeks ago.  She told me "This is so much better than that sh*t they have on Mondays."
Really curious what that thing with cassidy means for the future...
Aew only put this card/show together because this was their response to the new nxt logo and rebranding genius !!!!
Literally the best ppv I have seen. Even my little brother was excited.
I swear I expected Jericho to lose, I would have sworn my life on it, biggest shock of the night
Was a golden up.paper veiw cm punk looked good still
13:05   it wasn't  "some guy"  playing guitar.  It was the guitar player from FOZZY!
what an event! aew aew aew aew
This was definitely a historic PPV event. If you were not entertained last night I honestly don't know what you could possibly want to see in a wrestling event.
One bigger return was Edge other that nothing can beat it
If you think Adam cole is going to be with the elite after what they did too him your stupid
Your comments almost as good as the PPV. Love it. I would love to have a pint with you Simon, just to hear your wrestling stories. 👍🏼
I love this guy 😂
CM Punk, Minoru Suzuki, Ruby Soho, Adam Cole, and Bryan Danielson. The stars were out last night and the event as a whole was amazing. PPV of the Year.
Vince: *Hello, Brie can you return next week. I have a special segment with you and Nia. (Hehehe)*
This was really ALL OUT, they got the hottest free agents in the world and now their roster is bloated with great talent. Can't wait to see what's in store in the future
Meanwhile, that other company is thinking about bringing in McGregor to their roster. So smart *sarcasm*
CM Punk is 42 years old. So what? Loads of older wrestlers take flip dives. Why give him so much credit for a normal thing in wrestling?
I also loved the press conference afterwards😂 I’d never had guessed Bryan Danielson had such a potty mouth. “Cm Punk wants to help put the young guys over….I want to beat their F’ing asses!!!” Epic
AEW : All out deserve a Emmy, Grammy and a Oscar. I don't know how to explain the Grammy part. Maybe the superkick party part.
One of my favourite bits of the night was when Jericho picked up MJF for the powerbomb into the apron, you can hear MJF say "Oh s**t!"
Simon is like that wrestling nerd fan friend we never had
lucha bros vs young bucks is my new favorite tag team match ever. Never have I considered a match over and then bam kick out. I loved it.
this and takeover new orleans best ppvs the last 5 years
Just an amazing early morning for me! Definitely worth me struggling with tirdness at work today on my first day back after 2 weeks off!
Golden up or boycott Simon
The joy that Simon exudes in these videos is what brought me back into wrestling.
What a time to love wrestling. (I usually dislike  hyperbole, but this was a FAULTLESS ppv... just wow).
darby is the better one he should have won fuk cm punk
The Dusry finish is always dumb. Why wouldn't they always do it? It's like VAR in football - you either use it or don't
Definitely the best AEW PPV.... maybe of the decade
Talk about long term booking.. Bryon Danielson waited years to get revenge on the WWE for the Royal Rumble debacle oh so many years ago.
I think SimOn going to have a big O during this. Ha.
He pinned Eddie. He didn’t beat him with the game over.
AEW screwed theirselves last night. Why? 👋🏼😑Here’s Why. They cannot follow this up with the NYC show or Full Gear in November. Best PPV I’ve ever seen and I’m 40, so I’ve seen a lot of PPVs.
That was the best pay per view I scene in a very long time, if not the best. AEW is on another level
24k golden up
Wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall on Sunday and Monday at WWE HQ after that?  Raw for 9/6 - good luck
someone cant do maths 12+456 and they get 477. Still Awesome show and AEW is outstanding just now
Best wrestling PPV/show  i've ever seen
Hated the fact the Jeriblow got a win over MJF. Way to put the young talent over.
Diamond up
Them 31 dislikes are wwe 😂😂😂 aew is top dog 🐕
I had the same thoughts. I can’t want to see what Simon says about this 😂
It was the best ppv we have ever seen only wished I was there
Simon gives the show a golden up. Cornette will give the show a toilet bowl.  Something there for everyone.
That show was the best in the world
Maybe it’s time for a diamond or platinum up?
We’re living in the wrestling matrix
One of the best wrestling shows in along time. Think about how people will talk about this 20 years from now.
That cage match was the first time wrestling ever brought tears to my eyes. After that brutal match when penta celebrated with his kids, it tugged at my heart strings. So good!!!
Looks like Miro did redeem Eddie Kingston's nuts
I cannot wait till Simon reviews shows. I get excited when his video posts. I love his excited positivity. Then, I go find Jim Cornette's review for the negativity side. Yin-yang of wrestling reviews.
Just being a nerd - you added 466 instead of 456
Instead of multiple golden ups, you can have the golden up, platinum up and a diamond up.😆
I can think of at least 10-20 ppvs from the 2000s that were better and y’all on here like “it was the best ppv ever” 😂😂😂
I want that shirt
I don't need a million dollars I'll take a golden up since you gave 2.3 million to this show I understand if you're low lol 😊
Pffffftttt.....
I loved this show, I truly don’t get the love for the youngbucks match though. Maybe just me personally but I can’t get into the dueling acrobatics
I have to see this ASAP
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Add the number 456 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
All Out definitely made me warm and fuzzy in my tum tum
Travis Scott jordan 1 fragments
The lucha brothers and the young bucks stole the show
the only and the biggest down is bryan's theme
All Out gave us everything we predicted and hoped for and everyone loved it.
The thought of watching Raw after this is laughable. AEW is just too damn good.
Lucha Bros and Young Bucks = match of the year contender!! That was BAD @$S
I'm very curious to know who will take the title from Kenny Omega at Full Gear, so many options, but I'm betting on Adam Page
The cage match shouldn’t have gotten the golden up, it should’ve gotten the diamond up 💎
Jericho match was a mess. Who had the authority to restart the match? Didn’t make any sense
Simon "some guy playing guitar during his entrance"  That's Billy Grey, he's in Fozzy.
I haven't even started this video & I'm already hyped. We all should have warm & fuzzy feelings in down in our tums tums after last night. I feel like I woke up Christmas morning lol.
This is seriously an amazing time to be a professional wrestling fan. Sometimes dreams can actually come true. Lmao this whole thing definitely deserves a golden up.
Great review, only thing I wish you had mentioned was Leyla Hirsch suplexing nyla rose! That was insaaaaane!
Wow something nice after everything else is crap
the only thing better than all out is simons reaction! you rule!
Now that is all out of the way...Maybe they can get back to wrassling...plus I feel it's time to end the WWE refugee grab...for now. There is still plenty on talent to pluck up...I can name three that fits, Jacob Fatu, Alexsander Hammerstone and Sami Callihan. Not including all the female talent!
Dear AEW fans,   We are fucking spoiled.
I give one down cuz we came in suits with a sign that said "Simon give our suits an up" and unfortunately it just didn't get caught on camera lol
AEW literally did go All Out
All Out has to be the best Pay Per View i've ever watched
This the best Ups and Downs EVER!!!! Yes i said EVER! The cage match got a pfff noise and a golden up and that was worth the video alone! Again i said EVER!!! Prove me wrong
I love AEW ❤️️
What a great show!!! Great time to be an AEW wrestling fan! Best PPV of any wrestling company in the past 5 years
Here to see if Simon got a warm and fuzzy feeling in his tum-tum?
This was a wrestling PPV for the fans. Virtually every booking decision was to either to further a story or straight up fan service.
The Best Show I've ever seen
Are we ready to see Undertaker vs The Rock vs Stone Cold tonight on Raw? Lmfaooooooooooooooo
This whole video gets a golden UP
The ending of the Jericho/MJF match ruined the match for me cause Jericho didn't get on his foot on the rope in time. He lost, he should be retired.
You Sir, are a genuine wrestling treasure. Keep up the great work!
All the good bits aside, but 12+456 is actually 468 lol and not 477
U make wwe sounds like shit. Lol
That Jericho Countdown by MJF was HILARIOUS!!!
Am sorry to hurt anyone feeling but AEW is actually better then WWE right now
PFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
this the show was good but not perfect. the surprises were what made it good
AEW makes my 40 year old self  feel like I’m watching Monday night wars again this is the greatest time to be a wrestling fan since then.
Simon Monday Morning: OMG!! AEW is awesome!! This is the best I’m gonna rewatch! 400 ups!!   Simon Tuesday Morning: OMG! I want to shoot my eyes out! Why does WWE make me watch this?!? 200 downs. I hate RAW!! 😆😳
There were downs? I'm usually highly critical of aew, but I struggle to think of a better ppv I've ever seen. Especially as an adult.
Big brown down
Less all the debuts, the show would still be A+
It is obvious this is how they build to a rematch on the NY show where Eddie wins the belt at home.
Kenny and  Cage had their R2 timing right on the money 🤣🤣🤣 seriously one of the best PPVs I have ever seen bravo AEW!!!
Love you Simon! Was looking forward to this video
if there are people who are so naive to aew and refuse to watch, i beg you for your own fun, please watch aew man you are missing out so much.
Great recap!!
Let’s call it what it is…AEW spoils us, they just do. They learned from their mistakes and are still learning and they just give us damn near everything!
"Keep oblitering them" is a quality Millerism.
Miro Vs Kofi was awesome
If you don’t think this will effect tonight’s raw, you aren’t paying attention.
ITS ALL ABOUT THE COLE! I woke up my whole family at past 3am UK time 😂
I’d be more impressed if you could cross body a fly if I’m being honest. Those shots are fast lol
One of the greatest wrestling PPV's I've ever seen. AEW just leveled up.
Has someone checked if Vince is okay?
Lol why was Adam cole kissed like that
All matches in All Out deserves golden up, best PPV of my wrestling life  Give AEW PPV of the year award
It's awesome seeing how far AEW has come from their first show Double or Nothing till now. I'm proud of the OG's and the new people to help push what the og's have started to make it even more better. 👏 AEW is the place to be and the show to watch!
In my household all we watch is aew i knew this ppv was going to be great but holy shit I did not expect it to be this GREAT like this ppv was PERFECT. thank you aew for making wrestling GREAT again!!!
Undertaker keeping his phone on airplane mode rn 😂
I like the Karrion Kross t-shirt you are wearing
Greatest ppv of all time
Man what a time to be a wrestling fan
I don’t even care that your math was off by 10 golden ups.. it deserved 10 more golden ups! What a great Ppv..
Best PPV in over a decade. Not just AEWs best, but across the board of wrestling. I would have paid $100 for what we got last night. Truly amazing night. Wow
Not bad for a bunch of non-needle movers, lol
I can honestly say Bryan Danielson has lead to most of my favorite PPVs
Simon, Miro didn't win with the Game Over.  That's all. Love you.
This ppv was by far one of the best ones ever. Even Baker impressed me lol. I just have to give a small down to the fast eliminations of Riho, Skye Blue, and basically all the girls from Dark who have a total combines time of one minute in the match. Literally the only negative thing of the night
Has any told Simon that the wrestlers name is Brian Danielson and not Daniel Bryan? 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
By God AEW All Out last night was magnificent S class PPV, by far it's best production and that's saying  something  by their standards, Tony Khan must feel like a kid at the candy store right now, thanks for  reinvigorating Pro Wrestling 🙌
First PPV I ordered since the first All In. Awesome show
It’s crazy to me because I agree it’s one of the best PPV’s ever but I feel like the whole card excluding YB vs LB and MJF vs Jericho was so predictable. Even with a very predictable card this PPV still was an all time great
That ppv didn't miss. All hits.
Such an a amazing show
I usually think Simon is pretty easy on AEW as I think there are a lot of segments I think are bad he gives an up, however aside from Punk being gassed(I know totally understandable) and the match starting slow that whole ppv was great 👍 and I'm sure Punk will be even better in the coming weeks and months.(Not everyone can be like HBK and Christian and come back after 4-7 years and be just as good in their first match as when they left)
Inside show... Finally I'm able to say I like wrestling and not seem like a dork lol ... Great job
Don callis far cry cosplay....pagan min
Super Golden Up
Here's the issue. No one is talking about the matches. They're talking about the people who showed up. That works for now, but it's not lasting.
I love Aew but this formula of hiring wwe fires and kenny winning by cheating but Tony not "punishing" him is just getting kinda cold.
Lucha Bros v Bucks Best match i have ever seen.
This video made me smile.... Good job Simon..
I was actually there!!!! It was so amazing actually getting to be apart of the crowd and getting to be apart of all the moments
Well it looks like AEW went ALL OUT 😂😂😂
First aew show I've watched in full.. absolute classic
Wwe can’t possibly top this 😱😱
Thank God for the Paul Wight-QT Marshall match.  Without it, I'd have probably peed pants.  Because I sure wasn't going to risk missing a second of amything else.
Ups and Downs counter officially blown to smithereens!!
I think I'll be back for the AEW reviews in like 2 years when the new company goggles finally wear off. You know damn well there would be like 6 downs and maybe 2 ups if WWE booked their shows like this because that's exactly what happens during every RAW review.
Brie through WWE tables confirmed
Happy to see Ruby Soho win and the crowd loved it but imagine if hometown girl Skye Blue won
This ups and downs gets a golden up!
THE. BEST. WRESTLING. PPV. EVER.
"Super smash bros of wrestling" Yes...Yes essentially it is
Can't wait for Monday Night Raw's Ups and Downs tomorrow 😂 😂
Best PPV I've seen in well over 10 years. Ended up feeling like I got way more than I paid for and did I ever.
This AEW feels like the height of WCW and the NWO in the 90s as the alternative.  They have so much momentum.  I hope it lasts.
I bet we see a faction with Punk, Darby, and Sting
Simon should give a diamond up then a platinum up if theres more than 1 golden up
Adam Cole Bay Bay making his debut before Daniel Bryan was just beyond perfect. It was genuinely one of the biggest shock debuts in recent memory within professional wrestling. Obviously along with CM Punk's debut as well and Bryan Danielson, well done AEW.
I love it when I'm about to write a comment about you calling him Daniel Bryan, is when you say the you were calling him the wrong name. Damn Simon that gets an up. Haha
When DVD come out of this
Friendly reminder that AEW employs zero writers. This is what happens when you get corporate suits OUT of the way and let wrestlers control their own character development. Bravo!! 👏👏👏
Can’t remember the last time I was this warm and fuzzy in my tum tum
Cole did not turn heel because he was heel in nxt, came out the heel tunnel at all out, and he was in Jordans. He was heel the whole time
Btw, Punk, Bryan, Christian and Moxley VS The bucks, Omega and Cole at full gear. You read It here first.
I used to see WWE as the superior brand. This changed completely with this ppv.
Simon is the reason I got back watching wrestling, he really loves wrestling.
ALL OUT had to be one of the if not the best wrestling PPV in the past decade PERIOD it was that damn good! PS I love your ups and downs Simon
Had to unlike this video, just to like again
Matt Hardy  Malochi Black  Chris Jericho Paul BS Wright “Christian” Cage CM Punk Daniel Bryan  And now Cole.   Slowly turning into WWE 2010. So who’s next??
One of my favorite PPV besides WM17
Best pay per view of the year
After this life is goooooooooood
This is one of the ppv that is worth it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Young bucs vs Lucha bro, match of the night and honestly i only watch RAW for RK BRO and smackdown for rey mysterio
First match better than all 3 hours of raw
I hated it,they made me too happy
This PPV has everything in modern pro-wrestling. Squash, big man match, cage, spot fest, tag without tags, tag match with lots of people, big star power, veterans, surprises
That damn mjf I was laughing like crazy
That might be the best Wrestling show I have ever seen🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍🙏
I'm ready to see Punk vs Kenta
I can go buy meat again lmaooo
Legitmately one of the greatest wrestling shows in history.
The best ppv of the decade
Never got 2k20 bc it wasn’t worth it but I’m changing my WWE2k19 Roster into AEW.
LOL at first when Adam Cole went out, I thought there was some kind of mistake because I was like "Why is he going out through the heel entryway?", and then it happened. "Ohh okay." 😂
All out is like the werestlemania of wwe
17:34 right now on All Out started a storyline on level of Hangman's saga: Darby Allin The Best in The World, how its gonna be i dont know, but i know when its gonna happen, and prepare yourself for a huge mindblow, this was prepared since or even before AEW started, because the answer its on his own name: All In !!!! (Darby Allin AEW World Champion on All In 2)
Simon miller became a golden up he is so funny :D
AEW is really putting a company together where you can appreciate every single athlete. They all bring something unique and its quite entertaining.
And I would never have guessed tag title change and Adam cole appearance on this show
Sadly Bryan Danielson doesn't show up with the legendary Final Countdown theme, but overall was an amazing ppv
WCW jr😂🤣
As someone that watched WWF/E, WCW, and later NJPW and AEW - that was the best PPV of all time. The best ever. It took what you thought was the high, and kept going higher.   Cole and Danielson turning up in AEW felt like when Hall and Nash showed up in WCW. These weren’t two guys that were released; they were offered new contracts but chose to jump.   It might not be on a Monday night; but I think we’re seeing that beginning of a new war.
I rarely mark out when watching wrestling these last few years... perhaps once or twice since 2017... but in one night, I marked out when Lucha Bros won, when Adam Cole debuted, when he turned heel, and when Bryan debuted... 4 times, I was clapping along in my apartment like a moron....no other show got that out of me in years... maybe even a decade!!
Nick hogan Jackson
Only down in the entire card was... Danielsons white T-shirt.
So does AEW use “the most devestating move” or is that just a total WWE thing. Also….why are the referees 10X better at their jobs on AEW?? I’m just knit picking on how WWE can get better!
I've already watched the Young Bucks vs Lucha Bros match again this morning and I yelled "Rey, get down from there you fool!" again.
This Ups and Downs also deserves a golden up. Simon, thank you for reacting how all of us were last night.
I was only thinking about this show while watching aew  At that time I was only thinking this show is absolute masterpiece should only be fair to give it golden up
Best Pay-Per-View EVER
Remember, this PPV was brought to you by a "piss ant" company. And this all happened, because Vince didn't let Cody to stop being Stardust.
I love how AEW has different entrance tunnels for faces and heels and they keep it consistent. It gives the impression that the faces and heels don't hang out backstage before the match. AEW minds the little details
I was MORE SHOCKED by the two golden ups than anything AEW did (just kidding, but I was pretty shocked). Love your positivity Simon. Hi from Peru
Random thought. I would to see Walter in AEW. Can you imagine the classics AWE would let him have. He had some really good ones in WWE, but he would be like a final boss type in AEW.
and we love you, simon.  i for one, really love watching your enthusiastic take on these shows.  makes me appreciate the biz more every time.
Best ppv of the 00s = WMX7 Best ppv of the 10s = MITB2011 Best ppv of the 20s = All Out 2021 May well have taken that title already.
It was alright, Danielson, Punk/Allin and Cole were the good points to thw show imo
456 Golden Ups 🤣🤣🤣 It was a fantastic show and I’m still giddy from last night.   Also, to add context, those are about $4000 shoes that Matt and Nick added thumbtacks too.   That Lucha Bros entrance was a golden up in itself.   I love pro wrestling.
My favorite Bald British Guy
This is absolutely the best wrestling PPV I have seen since ECW Heatwave 98!
I'm proud to be a fan of wrestling aew continues to create magic. Three new debuts all in one night. I'm hype for their future
I was at the show live. It was nearly a perfect event. Golden Up for me.
Oh my goodness! Jim Cornett's show is going to be fire talking about this PPV! I can't wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Aew make us as wrestling fan enjoy wrestling again.. this is pro wrestling. Not world sport entertainment..
A metaphor I've come up with recently:  Vince McMahon sees himself as this great chessmaster, and he expects everyone else in pro wrestling/sports entertainment to be playing chess with him.  Then along comes Cody Rhodes and company, and they set up a table so they can play poker with their friends. Turns out, more wrestling companies are game to play poker than chess, so they keep sending people to the table, and eventually, more tables get set up, turning what was a home game into a top-grade tournament.  This is the world we live in. A world where you can play chess, or you can play poker. And as it turns out, a lot of wrestlers are having more fun playing poker than chess. Who knew?
Simon Miller is one of those GTA characters that you pick up late at night 😣
Vince is bringing back SABLE
U should start a platinum up or diamond up. All Out was a Platinum up or diamond up.
After that PPV i looked at my wife and she said yup, AEW is about to get lots of money from us on PPVs going forward. What a amazing show and thank you to all of the AEW stars for putting their bodies on the line for our entertainment.
I'm so glad I watched it live but man am I tired today.
What The Young Bucks did was fucking incredible
Best PPV I've ever seen
Honestly, this was so good, that I’m sure that if WWE ever were to fall, you could point to this exact moment as the point when it truly was over!
the aew fans are good giving spoilers!!!..cant keep their mouth shut bout surprises....we all knew was coming  but they ruin the moments
Cm punk is the 🐐🤫🥶
Darby should pack on a lil more weight cause all those dare devil moves going on get worse with age.
AEW All Out was PERFECT! Every single match delivered perfectly, Mrio & Kingston, So happy for the Lucha Bros what a cage match, the whole women's division shined Welcome to Ruby Soho, CM Punk is better then ever, Adam & Bryan both debuting   I! FUCKING! LOVE! A! E! W!
I wish the production was a little bigger. It's like the same set up as the weekly shows.
never watched aew before but after watching that show live blew my mind
Just think as well of these debuts and possibly some more. We still could have a horseman reunion in the near future
Shout out to AEW. They are doing they thing but damn Simon will never give them a down
Someone may have said it, but the guitarist for Jericho is from his band “Fozzy”.
i wish youtube allowed me to give this video a golden thumbs up
0:13 Muppets be like...
All Out was awesome! But the Punk v Darby match was super lackluster for me. Especially after all the hype
I wanna see all the aew hate now
We wish wwe the best in their future endeavors
I think I've fell in love with Kris the alien. The character and the person. I think she is the next ultimate warrior that can actually wrestle and isn't verbally psychotic.
Damm didnt know Johnny Sinns was in whatculture.
This was one of the best PPV...
It was awesome to see Kojima and Suzuki get some well deserved love in the USA.
Just give it an Up and just mark out with everyone about it
we are living in the “history book” times of wrestling. going to be telling these matches/debuts to my grandkids lmao
AEW Dynamite should move to Monday nights! Screw it! Stomp on WWEs neck while they have the momentum and send Vince packing for good! Go All Out! (See what I did there?) haha
I havent Steen this video yet but i wanted to predict and demand a golden Up for the tag team Championship match
Best ppv I've seen in a very very long time.
No downs. That shit was worth every damn penny
best tag team match I ve ever seen no question. I always read how good the bucks were but God that destroyed my expectations.
Is this the first-ever Golden Up?
Everything about the show was great except for QT Marshall, please get him off tv , nobody wants to see him..
Show was fucking perfect
0:13 Someone should gif that.
Vince “AEW aren’t a threat” Tony Khan: “Hold my beer!!!”
I literally started watching AEW because I heard CM Punk was coming back and I’m glad I did 🔥🔥
I loved this PPV
The R2 reference gets a Golden Up
All out ppv. has just stacked in our mind the best wrestling ppv ever .Simon gave the show golden up and  iam going to give tonnnnny khan the ceo of aew double golden up  because he  listens to fans and makes them happy.
Johnny sins wins again.
wow all ups? this is awesome
“Im gonna give everyone a million dollars” hahaha
This was a phenomenal pay per view. Worth every penny
It is a grand time to be a wrestling fan!
Wow!
Seriously 11 - 0🥱
May all your ups be golden.
"Of course he powerbombed Orange Cassidy. He's a piece of fruit and he can't sell him in his shop" Golden ups all around
I think this is a near perfect show. Like if I would whine about something it would only be the Big Show match because it was all filler and nothing of substance. But I guess you need matches like this to allow the crowd to rest for a bit.
I just wish they’d stop being so ridiculously obvious when waiting to take a bump. They almost all due it except a select few
The moment I seen Bryan danielson. I said to myself can’t wait for g1 climax
Nice Jackson looks like beefcakes run in the nwo
On the other hand... WWE... brings... Brock Lesnar... again... for 13536634th time... for main event...  yeah... wuuu wwe.
Best PPV I've ever seen
All the golden ups, new age of wrestling
wwe fanboys are rabid on twitter tryin to say this wasnt good XD
If WWE isn't shitting themselves right now, they should be
You nailed it when you said one of the best *wrestling* PPVs ever.  WRESTLING is back on the menu boys!
456 golden ups?  WWE better book Goldberg some more....
Waited all day for this after watching live last night. I just KNEW Simon would be all giddy and its great to see lol. One of the best PPVs I ever saw in the history of wrestling and if this doesn't put WWE on notice, nothing will (which I hope it does as they will actually work on programming for once which means everybody wins).
Ruby Soho's reaction to the crowd = good wholesome fun.  She was nearly in tears in the media scrum saying"I've never had chants before".
Best PPV I've seen in years
All out was awesome beats anything the WWE did
Can we call the roll up the most devastating move in sports entertainment when it comes to AEW? Cause this ain't no sports entertainment this is wrestling!  Can't wait to see raws response tonight!
what a load of shit. This could not be anymore biased if you tried.
Simon is a national treasure
am I the only one who thinks Jericho should of lost and put MJF over in the end
DONT need to watch this today bit Simon is just so enjoyable.  This whole show deserves a GOLDEN UP
QT Marshall v Big Show the only miss on a otherwise perfect show
It was one of the best shows I've ever seen.
A great show with no surprise roll ups
Miro did in fact "redeem" Eddie's nuts for the win.
This Episode of Up and downs get a Golden Up
Amazing phenomenal awesome just a ridiculous ppv from start to finish.
Golden up?
One of the GREATEST WRESTLING PPV's EVER. So exciting, was glued to my seat from start to finish.
I should have known from the nikes on his feet and that he came out of the heel tunnel how his debut was going to go
Can they stop calling moxleys underarm DDT as the paradigm shift? Because it was the dirty deeds and then it was his finisher in the first few AEW appearances. But now it is just an underhook ddt. The paradigm shift is an elevated (or lifted) underhook suplex-brainbuster mix.
That mjf troll entrance was amazing. Man does he play a heel to the max.
So, Miro actually redeemed those nutz... Huh... Be careful with what you wish for, Kingston.
Now that is how you throw together a PPV, yes WWE superstars have amazing matches most to almost all the time but the booking & way the WWE PPV is delivered by creative or whomever just make it feel like a RAW or some regular show sad they throw together great amazing PPV quality when they go to Saudi Arabia …. AEW killed it last night very awesome
Ruby Soho coming out to Ruby Soho was my second favorite part after the tag match. I love Rancid, I hoped she'd come out to that song. She came out to that song. Tum tum got a warm fuzzy feeling
Good math editor
This was what I always imagined the perfect PPV being like.
Kenny has to be the best wrestler in the world. He is doing a great job at making people hate him and he elevated Christian to a main event match. All Out Was amazing.
Try and follow THAT, Vince McMahon! Muahahaha! Lol 😆 😘 "ain't no chance in hell!" - Adam Cole BAY BAY
All Out ppv was incredible overall
ADAM COLE BAY BAY 😭
I love this show its the first time since i was a kid i screamed at the tv. During jerichos match i screamed turn around dumbass as if the referee could hear me. Aew has made wrestling enjoyable to watch again.
This was definitely a great Ppv...AEW now definitely has the momentum and the talent advantage.  I hope the ratings begin to shift towards AEW and we see Vince really start making some rash decisions lol
Deserved every golden up
This could be the ppv of 2021… from the start to the finish I enjoyed everypart of it. bryan, cole, Britt, omega, the butcher, soho. Loved this show
I agree with Simon. We are privileged with pro wrestling right now. Love it.
I felt 10 again! Best ppl ever
The only down in my book would go to the guitarist from Fozzy. Sounded out of tune and a little too fast for the fans to keep up
This was the best ppv EVER !!  Thx aew !! For weeks i hoped adam cole diden't resign with wwe and my dream came treu ! Then daniel bryanson🤯 suzuki , rubby soho 🤯 give me more Aew every day 🥳🥳
I have one question... what the hell is that thumbnail 😂 loved the ppv, best I have ever seen in my life so far
The best booked ppv I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Loved every minute of it can’t wait to have it come out on dvd/blue ray so I can cherish it forever. We love you tony khan. We love you Simon Miller
Someone Remind me...isnt Adam Cole the real life BF of Dr. Britt Baker?
Every single moment had a purpose and was exciting. Best PPV I can remember. Wasn't this happy about wrestling since I was a kid. 👏
I was really hoping Bryan Danielson would come out to The Final Countdown
Aew gets like 477-0 and wwe gets like 3-8 for ups and down AEW > WWE
Damn I’ve never expected seeing both Daniel Bryan and Adam Cole Bay Bay. All out is truly one of the best ppvs ever.
This was my first time watching an AEW ppv and it premiered at 5:30 in the morning here. But boy..was I glad to tune in
Young Bucks actually took a £4000 pair of TSxFragment highs and did the Candice LaRae spot. Fucking love it.
This is the first time I bought a wrestling PPV… First wrestling PPV I watched since I was 12 and I’m 30 now… This was the best PPV I ever seen.
MOX needs to get into a long feud I feel
Can’t remember what move it was but mjf sold that back injury really well he was full on screaming
My God 477 Golden Ups!? Possibly the best reviewed PPV OF ALLLL TIME
Im not trying to compare eras, but this was the best PPV i can recall in my lifetime. Not a single bad match. Plus im pretty sure i made fans out of my in laws too. Golden ups indeed☝️
Amazing Show. WWE was put on notice. Although WWE has incredible talent the booking is horrible. tHE MATCH STRUCTURED BY WWE ARE HORRIBLE. The ONLY THING GOOD IS SMACKDOWN AND NXT. WWE is dead to me now.
There was one more thing they could have done which would of giving me a heart attack. If they would of given the trailer and release date of the AEW Game. I would of lost it!
The things Simon says....golden up
All out 2021 is by far the best ppv I have seen in a long time. It's good to be a wrestling fan right now. Wwe should be worried
one word only : LEGENDARY !
Excited Simon is the best Simon
For those who didn't believe that wrestling fans was watching and flip flopping between NXT & AEW on a Wednesday night, the crowd was fully ready with Adam Cole's catchphrase.
Poor Simon has to go from this to RAW in just 24 hours lol
477!!!! Oh my!
Best PPV in modern pro wrestling history
Simon Miller kinda pulled a Dave Meltzer here by destroying his own system :P
They really went all out with this show!
Great show
AEW is THE BEST Wrestling Show going today woo!!! 477 million Golden Ups. Thanks Simon I had a lot of the same fun during All Out!!  All killer no filler. The most important wrestling moment since the 90's. A round of applause for AEW 👏👏👏👏👏👏. Absolutely beautiful!!!
Simon, none of this actually happened, what is the fantasy booking all about?
Simon none of this actually happened, wasn’t this some weird fantasy book you wrote
Pretty damn good show. So many dream matches and promo battles to come.
Not a fan of wrestling romaces per say, but I really want to see Kris Statlander and Orange Cassidy in a relationship onscreen
I'm sorry. I have 2 best matches of the night. Lucha Bros vs YB and Jericho vs MJF. Because I never seen it coming. That Jericho match restarter was amazing. WELL DONE AEW. Also Lucha Bros YOU DESERVE GOLD. THANK YOU TONY FOR GIVING IT TO THEM. They worked their butt off for gold.
I think Adam Cole Joined the Elite to try and take it over and become leader then he's gonna go after that AEW title because those 2 in the group together I'm not seeing Adam Cole being second
Lucha Bros vs Young Bucks was match of the night for me!   Also, that spear from Red Velvet was sick!!
The botch save by omega was gold!
Bryan Danielson vs Kenny Omega match will be legendary
All Out brought my dad to wrestling again. He had stopped watching after few years when WCW died and he doesn't know anything about Punk or Bryan but when he saw it he wanted to know all about them and how AEW started.
You should give the main event and everything that followed a Platinum UP
Is there really a down from this whole PPV….  Hell no!!!
PFFT
All out deserves a platinum up.   Great fucking show.   Best one I've seen in years
Simon calling Paul White "Big Show"       No more BS...
Youngbucks vs Luchabros was absolute insanity and I loved every minute of it.
will Adam Cole be accompanied to the ring in his matches by Britt Baker? Is Britt Baker now ALL Elite?  Also Bryan vs Kenny Omega will be such a fast paced match!
JR said Big Show again
The key thing is all who join are joining coz they can be happy and do what they love which is wrestle and help AEW grow and experience it. And damn I'm glad I'm a day 1 fan , Let's all appreciate the simplicity and magnificence of AEW all out it was the best show of the year for sure !
Lol Jim Ross saying Big Show & Ruby Riott name are hilarious 😂
Miro VS CM Punk will be awesome.
ALL OUT gets a golden up
My ONLY complaint is that in the women's battle Royale, we didn't see like half the people coming in, or some of the eliminations. I hope it's something they'll get better at with time
I'm laughing at Simon's reactions and enjoying the heck out of this video. Simon, never change. You are the absolute best and deserve a golden up!
Lucha Bros vs Young Bucks is definitely match of the year across ANY wrestling promotion
Miro’s win gets a DOWN. Anything Miro does gets a down
WWE is like Earth 616 and AEW is like the Multiverse of Madness
The show was like a fever dream after a three course meal consisting of Candyfloss, Cheesecake and ice cream...  Just absolute madness, and I loved it!
Awesome PPV, but 2 low points imo. 1-Dont' pull a WWE and start to showing the referees like idiots. 2- For the love of everything put MJF with someone else!
Loved that the Chicago crowd  sang Suzuki's theme, I was really hoping they would but didn't expect it, but man I got chills
Last nights ppv is when I got to really enjoy it there were tons of great matches and we got to see two ex wwe guys make their debut. And then you got Vince fucking up his promotion and firing most of his younger talent and bringing back his veterans so he try to draw ratings and etc and is refusing to push most of his wrestlers  Vince at this rate needs to retire he is too old and he can’t do what he use to do best  This is why I love AEW and thanks for making wrestling great again
Best PPV since all out 2019
Dare I say that was the PPV of the decade
AEW All out lived up to the hype. 10/10.
Last night was my first ever AEW PPV. I have no idea how AEW is going to top this PPV.
My question is with the rankings...Orange should be ranked number 1 now..but with Bryan here does he jump into the title picture or those Orange go for the tnt title?
AEW isn't a WCW 2.0. AEW is standing on its own 2 feet. These guys are just wrestling fans running wrestling shows for other wrestling fans. Lets goooo!
Bucks vs Bros is the 2021 match of the year.
With Halloween around the corner, with Bray Wyatt possibly signing and his release clause expiring that same week. it would be so dope if he debuts on a Halloween edition of Dynamite
Checks Twitter, still unforgiven for mentioning that the up counter didn't increment. 😥 I wonder if Simon was having a really bad day that day.
AEW ALL OUT 2021 = WRESTLEMANIA X7 2001 👍
Simon surely had fun. Already 5 ups.
Ruby Soho winning the Casino Battle Royal, Adam Cole coming back to life to join the Elite, Daniel Briansen debuted, and the Suzuki clobbering Jon Moxley was exciting.  What's next..... Repo Man to AEW?!
Amazing show dude. Just top notch
As much as I'm happy to see Cole back with the elite it's a little bittersweet knowing he's not gonna get his wrestlemania moment.  But he's probably happy to be in full arenas instead of a warehouse of a few hundred.
Cornette I could hear malfunctioning last night all the way in Canada. Great watch last night.
What an amazing show, “ALL OUT” genuinely deserves a golden up
Lucha Bros vs Young Bucks is the match of the night at All Out
Moxley IS the forbidden door...
Miro vs Eddie was terrific for what it was. Miro is outstanding and Eddie fills his role well. Moxley match was kinda just there. The post match was highly entertaining.  The cage match (mind you I am NOT fan of the Bucks) was one of the best cage matches I've ever witnessed- the Bucks really seem to be listening to some criticisms against them. They sold very well and told a fantastic story. Womens battle royal was sloppy but fun at the end.  Darby, Darby Allin is just tremendous. Great match. Based Punk showing all the flippety dippetys in the back how to tell a story. Did I mention Darby is amazing? Main event was better than I thought it would be. Overall a 5 star ppv. Best in many many years. And I didn't even touch on the debuts.   *THIS REVIEW WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY SOMEONE THAT AGREES WITH JIM CORNETTE ON 85% OF THE THINGS HE SAYS*
I don't even watch wrestling anymore, but I sure as hell watch Ups & Downs. No need to even watch the shows when there's content like this. :)
It's Monday you know what that means!  Welcome to RAW Legends Night
Please can AEW get its own intro for Ups and Downs?
Finally, Bucks lost belts 🥳🙌 first reign of terror over. Now to enjoy the little time while they don’t have them before they become first two time champs!
This PPV made me happy in my tum tum
Only nitpick of entire show was the superkick spot in the tag team match, whole thing was awesome
Brian Danielson makes his AEW debut. Looks like Vince is bringing Brie out of retirement to have Nia Jax put her through a table.
All we now need is Bray and Buddy. AEW is on fire 🔥
woke up my family last night screaming Adam Cole Bay Bay and Yes
waiting....first comment
We need something greater than a golden up for that tag team match. I suggest a diamond or platinum up for that match.
Golden up. Already calling it
Adam Cole vs Hangman Adam Page will be a greater feud on AEW
I like simons reviews on all the shows🤘🏾
Adam cole bay bayyyyyy
I don't think I've ever seen a ppv quite like that last night. Frigging awesome. Baker foreshadowing Cole with a panama sunrise? The cage match?  Danielson,  soho, the return of the butcher, even? Yes, please!
Aew has become YES bay bay.
It was the best ppv I have ever seen
Adam Cole BAY BAY
I'm just going to guess... it's an UP 🤪😵
You guys are appreciated but we gotta hear Cornette on this one👀
Hell yeah was waiting for Simon on this one! 🤘🏻😎
Yes! Yes! Yes!
