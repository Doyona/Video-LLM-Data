The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is one of the most overrated superhero movies I've seen in my life and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man is probably the superhero movie character I hate the most.
Plz react to first and last episode of Kevin can go f**k himself!!! It would be such a good reaction😭 such a goood show
Rewatching and ran to the comments to say thank god Dylan isn’t doing the weird bubly ads anymore ❤
where is the unicorn academy video though
watch gravity falls pleaseeeee😭😭😭
Dylan, when are you gonna watch The Amazing Spiderman 2?
dylan’s taste in youtubers never disappoints me
HIM CALLING UNCLE BEN AN EVIL MAN IS HILARIOUS 😂
with great responsibility comes great territory also i had the exact same realization at 21:37
Bit by the love bug, man
I know that this video was posted a year ago, but how's nobody talking about the two cans of bubly in the bottom left on the table that were so obviously added in post? It took me until 3:47 to notice... Why are they there? They're consistently there until like 8:40 XD why?
Please don't make me wait 2 full years for a unicorn academy commentary. Dylan, please.
6:12 rewatching this and laughing at the kurtis conner reference for the nth time
“She’s not even multiple fields” 😂😂😂😂 I’m dead
BITTEN BY THE LOVE BUG
“Tonight’s the night” Dylan becomes Dexter
i’m back
18:10 she was bitten by the love bug
and he never watched spiderman into the spiderverse
22:53 that’s called foreshadowing 💀
“ with great responsibility, cause great territory” 😂😂😂😂😂 19:54
Still waiting on unicorn academy
Loved the video but he didnt comment on the scene of Peter acting like a spider with the webs in the sewer
Dylan???? where is the amazing spiderman 2 commentary?
18:15 by a love bug
I genuinely do not recall Gwen dying in the next movie, and now I'm upset. Sheesh thanks Dylan.
dylan PLEASE watch the second one
18:09 bitten by the love bug dylan tgats what she meant 💀
You could’ve worked in the easy A joke when she was describing herself as the smartest in her class as well as the fact that she was working in such a high position as a high schooler
Emma Stone is something else though. One of my biggest celebrity crushes. Yes she is a high schooler here, but the actress was 22 in this movie.
2nd movie is my favorite " Hes not just spiderman hes pretty freaking amazing" ALSO please watch 2
Dylan can u do a unicorn academy commentary
Just realised how the actor who portrays the young version of Spider Man in his movie is Spin from Lab rats Bionic Island
Okay im rewatching this and now I’m just wondering when you’re gonna watch the sequel
excuse me ofc we want you to react to unicorn academy!!
"I have to hump my chair" "I kind of like it sometimes" Huh?
18:29  Biten… as in biten by the love bug?
25:02 😂I know for sure Dylan screamed inside
19:53 😑 *cries in Marvel*
15:31 Stop making me realize how predictable my beloved childhood movies are😭😂
10:02  Dylan: “His voice went bonk-bonk-bonk into that ear. I know she heard that.” Me: Just wait… Uncle Ben: “He’s got you on his computer.” Dylan: OHHHH HE’s killing…NOOOO!” Me: Tried to tell you… Having seen this movie so many times I find myself doing this like every 10 seconds waiting for Dylan to unpause it and react 😂
I grew up with the Toby Maguire Movies and for a long time I ignored the Amazing Spider-Man Movies out of spite. But these days I grew to love every one of the three live action Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield is probably the best Spider-Man while Toby Maguire has to be the best Peter Parker. Tom Holland is a good mix of both but doesn't excell in one category in my opinion, which is still pretty good.
Colab with alex hefner
this spider man movie is honestly my favorite!! andrew is the best spider man
Do u get bitches? I feel like u can but u don’t, it’s weird
I don't know how many times I've seen this video and never noticed the bubly ad 😅 I love it
Dylan joking about throwing Gwen out the window and Peter running out of webbing is so funny in retrospect
yes Andrew is my favorite spiderman
I personally think one of the reasons the TASM movies did not pop off as hard as they really should have was that Andrew didn't have an actor that carried the villain side. Tobey had Willem's godly green goblin to play off, and I think to some extent even Keaton's vulture had a pretty compelling story with the twist. It's obviously not the only reason or main reason why these films were underrated, but I also think we've seen many times that giving the superhero protagonist a really well acted and compelling villain to bounce off of each other can really elevate a movie and make it much more memorable.  Though we did get the chemistry between Pete and Gwen so I'm not complaining.
I still kinda wanted to watch unicorn academy
She was bitten by the love bug 😭
this was great! whens the Unicorn Academy video gonna drop though ?
still waiting for the unicorn academy commentary
Wait please react to Spider-Man no way home that is literally my new dream please I beg 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Now I know why I’ve never liked the idea of someone stalking me. I don’t have a spider tattoo.
1:48 💀💀💀
20:00 That's actually crazy because this just made me realize something about myself. I love spiders. I want to get a pet tarantula someday. Last night I was watching 27 Dresses, and when we get to the part where the guy finds her schedule and like writes his name in it and stuff, I was like "That's kinda cute" 😭😭
unicorn academy is pretty good, i was invested when watching it with my niece😂
Over a year and no sequel? You teasing little troublemaker!
Oh I wish he would review the second one as well!!
the way i scream   'F YOU!!! ' everytime he mentions Gwen's death 😭
21:02 SOO FUNNYY
ik im gonna regret saying this.. but ive never wanted to be a chair so badly in my life. Exhibit A... 4:20
7:57 This is actually a pretty realistic scene. This is just the average NY Subway experience.
These ppl probably have seen worse stuff than this, i mean, it IS New York 😅
7 minuets in and already got 5 ads.... at least your getting paid....congratiu-fucking-lantions i guess
12:50 …you mean a vest?
8:55 Dylan’s face when he smashed the alarm clock 😂😂😂😂
23:54 “There’s a sequel”…that he will never react to
MIB memory eraser 😂😂😂😂😂
Nobody gonna mention him calling Andrew the Garf? No? Alright...
Okay so why we ain’t see you watch the next one ?
6:58 Dylan that's llike one of the most legendary bollywood actors ever. And yes he did die 😭💀
Feel betrayed we still haven’t got the unicorn academy reaction
So sad there’s no sequel from Dylan
16:32 I don’t get it 💀 😭
16:35 she could be his rosetta Stone, if they sponsored this video...
OG movie for sure!!
Petition for Dylan to become the next the Uncle Ben when the inevitable reboot happens because I can just imagine the comedy of that death.
Tonight's the night?
Why are you a YouTuber people have feeling to what they watch and they like it and you dislike it and disowned and a lotta shows you disrespect like you disrespect the actors and shows but you don’t watch it at all like you just watch a movie and your like destroying it and shows like series you watch the beginning and the end like two different episodes that share elements in different dialogue like why destroy and disrespect shows and the cast it’s not good
I was just chuckling here throughout d video but d Easy F bit took me out..that was hilarious!!
17:21 yooo guy from the Quarryyyyy :0
still waiting for him to cover into the spivderverse
this is indeed the BEST spiderman movie
BY A LOVE BUG DYLAN 18.10
really would wanna see him react to spider-man no way home. it's not a movie suggestion tho haha😂
Bitten by a love bug Dylan 18:21
When she said "me, too", I thought she meant she was also bitten... by the love bug 😝
She means by the love bug, she thinks that's what he's saying
Did Dylan just call Andrew Garfield “moderately attractive”???????
Facts
revisiting this one   dylan repeatedly calling andrew “the GARF” is absolutely sending me
“ With great responsibility comes great territory” 😂😂😂😂😂the face really shows he had no idea he messed up the most important line on the whole series. Great territory?! 😂😂LMAO
kinda wanna see him react to the second one
"With great responsibility comes great territory." Dylan's famous last words to Peter
22:50 stop killing me 🤣😭
13:56 facts 😂😂
That man is weird, I hope Spider-Man kills me 🤣 go get him Garf😭
Imagineeee watching a video on Unicorn Academy😂
Even Stevens 😂😂😂😂😂😂
8:00 honestly if you are from NYC, people hanging from the subway car ceiling isn't anything new SHOWTIME iykyk lol
idk if it's just me but i feel like andrew's peter and dylan give off the same dorky vibes
23:04 please replay 😂
Peter really has to work on his timing, ghosting gwen after her dad died and then breaking up with her after the funeral 😂
I may be in the minority but I’ve never been a fan of the Tom Holland Spiderman films
please react to first and last episode of tv series White Collar
20:52 thats a rugby ball Dylan 😂
3:53 i think she as in teen wolf series. She played tracy... theo raeken's gf
bruh watch across the spiderverse
"Wouldn't it be funny if"....and then ACTUALLY doing that "funny" thing is a really great motivator if you ask me. I think I might have to actually use that. 😅
Not the Unicorn Academy show in his list 😂😂
Still waiting for the Unicorn Academy commentary
i had so many laughs
14:27  Love his reaction to this. Have whatever opinion you will about Andrew's Spidey, but he really had quips that felt like they were ripped right off the pages.  23:08
dylan looks like the type of guy to make a song called lalala
Dylan looks like Pewdiepie and bbno$ had a baby
Okay Edward Snowden, I agree it’s a great Spider-Man movie, but the best? Nah
Ain’t no way he skipped Andrews acting when uncle Ben died
I liked the actions a lot, and I feel the chemistry between the two. But I'm still gonna say Spiderman 2 is my favourite, it's art and art is subjective, and I'm biased towards movies that pull my heart strings more than anything
With great responsibility comes great territory made me laugh more than it should 😭 and the easy a stuff too even though Dylan milked the hell out of it lol
The annoying thing is that people only started raving about this movie in the lead up to No Way Home. Until then everyone kept shidding on my boy 😢
Your chronicles against Disney Plus' spacebar are the story of legends
The spacebar repeats your last click, it doesn't pause the video, that's why it probably kept escaping when you pressed it at certain times.
Okay, I'm a new viewer so I don't understand his process or his internet personality or anything. And after I saw this video I wanted to be mad because he seems to be over acting. Over reacting. Laughing too hard at parts that aren't necessarily that funny. And just insulting the whole movie. But again, I want to be mad but I won't since I don't know his channel or his way of doing things and judging him as a new viewer seems unfair. So if anyone can tell me if this is just over acting for content or his personality or if he has a video addressing these things. Please let me know. Because I'd like to know more before I judge and possibly make myself look like an ass. However, besides all that it was an entertaining video so I guess he accomplished his goal.
My little sister just made me watch all of unicorn academy the other day  😭
Title correction: The Amazing Dylan vs Disney's Space bar 🦸🏻
23:08 omg the validation in that moment 😂😂
18:12 gwen was biten by the "love bug"
Not my favorite spider man
With Great responsibility comes great territory 😅😅
dylans archnemesis: disney+ space bar function
Oh right, I forgot he doesn’t have organic webs. 😂
6:11 KURTIS CONNER MENTIONED?!?
Look, some high school kids can make it to such positions if given the right opportunity. It's actually not farfetched at all. I mean some kids intern at hospitals at young ages and undertake serious tasks. A tour especially is actually pretty normal and low-stakes. Idk it may differ in places, so I could be wrong.
I watched this video multiple times but I never really got the Easy A joke until now. I just chuckled at it because I was trying to make the same joke. 10/10 my type of comedy.
Make a commentary of Easy A
i feel like this is the first movie that I absolutely adore that Dylan has validated at the end as understanding why people love it bc it's good😅
Bitten by the love bug ding dong
u never watched the 2nd one
Glad to see the small knife joke getting its deserved credit
She meant she was also bitten by the LOVEBUG!!!Thats what she thought he was saying❤
Dylan saying "I hope spiderman kills him" I can't stop laughing 😂
I laughed at your joke in minute 28:35
"He's wearing one of those weird coats without sleeves" ALSO CALLED A VEST
Dylan, I'm laughing at the joke about the easy A 🤣😏😁❤️
Bit by the love bug
my favourite thing about this video is dylan calling them garf and stone it's so funny to me for no reason
8:01 that's just New Yorkers being New Yorkers
HE SKIPPED THE SEWER SCENE?!?!
Not me screaming in my room “she was bitten by the LOVE BUG !!” 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
She says “i have too”, about been bitten.. by the love bug!!! Duhhhh
Intertaining myself with his old videos just before a test 😌
why are frames so low on the movie scenes
18:15 Bitten by a love bug?
The fact that you haven't watched Andrew's Spiderman movies shocks me. You're American on top of that so where were you !? I watched them all chronically and I'm younger than you 😂
She was bitten by the love bug Dylan
Uncle Ben: "That's the girl from your computer." Dylan: 😲😨😖😫 Uncle Ben: "He's got you on his computer." Dylan: (highest pitch) "NOOOOOOOO!"  😂😂😂
With great responsibility comes great territory made me burst out laughing😂
“I’ve been bitten.” “So have I.”  By the Love Bug.
SHE WAS BITTEN BY THE LOVE BUG DYLAN😭😭😭
"OH MY WEAKNESS IT'S SMALL KNIVES!"  i love this quote so much 😂
it’s been 8 months when are you gonna react to the second movie YOU NEED TO
I don't see why some people don't like this movie! It's so good!!
Dylan constantly forgeting it’s New York. People saw crazy sh!t every day 😂 Now watch second Amazing Spiderman, and then Spiderman no way home. Andrews Spirdeman had amazing arc in the end. I cried so much 😢❤ Also, I love how his bully, Flash, still came to him, not as bully, but almost as a friend And the best Stan Lee cameo ever. R.I.P. 😢
Peter Parker: “I’ve been bitten.” Gwen: “So have I.”  Dylan’s missing context: I’ve been bitten by the love bug is a saying, babes.
the andrew garfield spiderman has been the BEST one since it came out thank you.
REACT TO THE SECOND ONE PLEASEE
Pleaseeee react to the second oneee
Still waiting for him to review the second one
by the love bug
Dylan tripping over the space bar man... first classic. Second iconicly funny. Third the Disney space bar piss me of but every time this happens I remember Dylan's fight with it and laugh
20:10 damn .... Howd you know
6:15 MY FAVE YOUTUBERS KNOW EACHOTHER?
I didn’t know people hated this spider man until I read these comments, bro WHAT this is by far one of the best (my personal favorite being miles morales) this is crazy 😭
The amount of money I'd pay this guy to watch Maxton hall.
I kind of want to watch unicorn academy
6:15 KURTIS CONNER REFERENCE????
"misdirect" dylan's fav word
is it just me or does Dylan look like MMG but with brown hair
Can you please react to the amazing spider man 2?
My man loved his Easy A joke so much he broke the rule of 3... tbh I thought the third one was too much.
4:21 is wild
“Great responsibility comes with great… territory”   OMGOODNESS DYLAN NO
WHERE IS THE UNICORN ACADEMY COMMENTARY???
I see how passionate you were about the spacebar on that 23:07 probably the most relatable part of the movie. hehe
Fav moments: 8:17 LMAO 8:54
The Easy A jokes 😂😂😂 I can't help but laugh!
"The great responsibility comes with great territory" is simply the best
He caught the guy when he had a knife
dylan talking about kurtis was just so unexpected and funny. like, my favorites know about each other!!!!!!
It’s so refreshing to see Dylan react to a movie he actually enjoys 😭 like finally these directors got it together
If he hated it I would’ve been so sad thank god 😂
kurtis connor reference
Never heard the saying "I've been biten by the lovebug" lol
I adore you 😂 that is all lol
Dylan is so fine God did a good job with this one. and yeh, this is def my top 2 spidey man  I rly like the second one. Jamie Foxx' bad guy origin story makes me so sad :(
unicorn academy is so good though
Andrew Garfield is the best Spiderman PERIOD
Bitten.... by the love bug. Duh. LOL
Please watch spider man homecoming
Dylan you gotta watch the new Planet of the Apes trilogy
whats up
justice for unicorn academy movie  commentary monday
The Easy A joke was only that funny cuz of how much excitement you had behind it
22:50 Dylan foreshadowing
PLEASE I BEG YOU . Watch “Better Watch out “ the plot twist I crazy !!!!!
I'm extremely late to this video but I watched your flash first and last episode reaction and now this and I'm totally subscribing, your videos are so fun to watch
16:35 NO DYLAN 😂THAT WAS A GREAT JOKE!! I actually went “AAAH hahahah👏🏻👏🏻” and I clapped. (I’m literally by myself like a lunatic)   That was clever 😂unless I have bad taste in humor but I really enjoyed that joke lol  ALSO ANDREW’S SPIDER-MAN IS MY FAVORITE 🫶🏻💙✨
I'm a crane worker. I found it so cool that all crane workers decide to unite to help spiderman, but since to turn crane the only thing you have to do is *turn button to the left* I found it so anti-climactic it's a really funny scene to me xD
This always been my favorite spiderman movie FINALLY its getting recognition
“I’ve been bitten” by the love bug Dylan. That’s what she meant
the amount of EasyA jokes 😭 and to think i laughed at almost all of them
7:58 Honestly, the NY subway scene is pretty realistic considering how little new yorkers react to crazy people on the subways these days with all the weirdos doing something new every day. Most New Yorkers I talk to tell me most people just go with minding their own business and going on with whatever they got going on so all that background crazy just becomes normal
Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man
Numerous Poor things happened to Gwen
Dylan, u are so fine sorry I cannot hold it in anymore so funny n hot wowie ❤
yes
His father figure may have never came home that night but at least he had milk.
I DIED when he dry humped the chair 😭😭
“Imagine if he was out of webing” yeah…
He’s literally the best one
Facts
"With great responsibility comes great territory"        -Dylan
DO TASM 2!!!
No doubts Andrew is my fav spider man. Love both of the movies, and died watching you react to it😂
when she says “so have i” i think thats her thinking he’s talking about getting bit by a love bug which would explain why she said “so have i” i’m surprised no one ever caught this
It's called The Amazing Spiderman after a line of Spiderman comics in these ones he dates Gwen.
YES I LOVED THIS MOVIE then it got really boring for a while THEN I LOVED THE ENDING
I am sorryy but why do you lowkey look like the sketch of the sunglass guy who killed Ben 😭😭😭😭
Idk if anyone answered this for you, Dylan but Gwen is saying she got bit by the love bug which is why she said “I did too”
for dylan id watch him watch unicorn academy
I feel like i should be insulted by the spider tattoo stalker comment. i have one and would not be impressed by a stalker. naughty dylan
17:52 she's been bitten by the LOVE BUG dylan
You should do reaction to the second movie fr
Watch the second one!
Dylan if you haven't seen the first Tom Holland Spiderman, you really should! It's (imho) hands-down the most charming and enjoyable Spiderman movie there is. His second and third aren't bad, but not NEARLY as charming. It manages to be the most light-hearted version, while also being deeply emotional, and it's balanced so well that I didn't even notice until I started trying to describe it.
DUDE. WHERES THE SECOND ONE. WATCH THE SECOND ONE
Hahaha. I liked the Kurtis Connor joke.
she meant that she was bitten by the love bug too dylan c'mon
The amazing spiderman movies are the best in my opinion
I feel like you'd love Deadpool. Lots of deaths and lots of jokes.
This is the best one. Idc. I said it
“with great responsibility comes great territory” -Dylan 2023
Dylan had a major glo-up! The hair and style evolution seriously needs to be studied!!!
You need to watch the next one please Dylan
I'm still waiting on that Unicorn Academy video! 🥲
i wish this movie wouldnt exist
i hate this spiderman cause all the skateboarder andrew garfield look alikes became the biggest assholes in school and ruined my whole live
CORRECT
This was my favourite spiderman.
7:58 that's just what the nyc subway is like
The only positive reaction to this movie ever
When tf is spider verse movie's coming I have been waiting for months and I just know I can't be the only one I wish he watches both movie's in one video
Yes we do in fact want Unicorn academy
The title of this video literally brought me here cause yeah this IS the best Spider-Man🥹
Watch part 2
dylan you’re making it so hard not to ask you to do a detailed three hour commentary on both spiderverse films. i need it like an itch that wont go away
I am the biggest slut for Dylan oh my lord he is so fineee
4:27 ayo
"Great responsibility comes with great territory" I absolutely lost it 😂😂😂
Цікаві відео , переглядаю для настрою , завжди допомагає😆
First time watching this guy and I couldn’t make it through 5 mins. Idk how people watch him lol dude has to have adhd or something. He couldn’t stop talking and didn’t let at least one scene play out the entire 5 minutes. He said pretty much nothing in those 5 mins too. It got annoying fast.
The Andrew Garfield Spiderman was canceled because of annoying comic nerds complaining about it but it had so much heart and charm. At the same time, the cancellation is part of what made it what it is today.
Que vídeo my friend ❤
I died laughing when he says "ooh an activity when the episode starts" I'm laughing now thinking about it
Kinda want to watch unicorn academy
the way dylan said “guys he just on the CEILING” was so fucking funny
honestly after reading the original comics the original peter is such a prick. so i actually think that the darker side of peter when hunting down bens killer works in this movie more than people say. this is a good spider-man movie but i think what drags it down is honestly just the memory of the second one that movie is just so bad i thought whenever it came out that i was never gonna enjoy a spider-man product again it was that bad
18:57. That is 100% a SUPRA
Yes! Favourite Spider-Man movie 🤩 Loved this - would love to see you cover the sequel as well one day 🤩
easy A joke was genuinely a 10/10
“Villain, AH VILLAIN HE’S WEARING SUNGLASSES AT NIGHT!” 😂😭
This us one of my favorite reactions of dylan
Is NO ONE saying anything about the kurtis conner joke OMG im dying 🤣💀
18:05 "Bitten by the love bug"
This movie in genuinely miserable to watch
PLEASE i need to see him watch the next one 😭😭 i've never seen them either and it's so enjoyable watching it with him bc of how he thinks fr
What Spiderman is this? I never seen him, or either i just don't remember him, i only remember Toby
18:15 bitten by a love bug . Cheesy
Unicorn academy>>>>>
With great responsability comes great territory...
Yes Andrew & Emma... now LET US HEAR THEM PLEASE!  Even having seen the movie, with *so much ranting* dear Dylan, it's a huge slog to follow. I gave up. Speak 50% less please🙏.
I‘m gonna start a game of guessing which joke he thought of before watching the movie, BEFORE he admits to it
What the hell are you doing?  I've watched only 4 minutes and i am 😨😨 we are here to watch your reaction not sarcasm bullshit
21:48 Don't mention the marbles I'm begging you Dylan
My maiden name is Gwen Stacy, I had never watched any spiderman movies until Into the Spiderverse came out. I always got teased about being Spiderman's gf through school though 🙃 the only scene I'd ever been shown from Amazing Spiderman was from the second movie of her being "caught" and throwing out her back 💀
Bitten by the “love bug” 😂
0:24 I mean……it’s not too bad                                                  go on, watch it
19:35 - 19:38 oh my gosh DYLAN!!!!! 😭😭😭
now second part!!!!
I’ll be waiting the unicorn academy commentary loool
Do the second one
I see Dylan i click - I see Andrew Garfield I VIOLENTLY CLICK MY MOUSE UNTIL IT FALLS APART
A commentary every Monday baby, still going strong, no misses on the schedule
Dylan that wasn’t his screen saver 😭 he was editing the photo
You should be watching the first 2 episodes of percy jackson, that is what you should be doing, but you're not going to do it anymore, because you don't like being told what to do, but, stick with me, if I say that you won't watch it, shouldn't you do it to prove me wrong? Yeah, that is what I thought... You won't do it, or will you?
"the best" not really but ok
Bitten by the love bug.
we need you to do spiderman 2!!!!!! funny vid btw
I think this is the first time I've seen dylan genuinely like a movie.
I’m a new subscriber who started binge watching most of your videos. Love your growth and love Misoa 🥹😭
STOP THE BUBLE ON THE BACKGROUND 🥲
plz watch pan's labyrinth
You have notoriously retarded movie takes. But it’s ok cause you’re kinda funny.
Watch the second movie!!
Season 1 thru 5 that’s all you need lol
But are we gonna watch the Unicorn one or what 😂
i am so ready for dylan to review saltburn
"With great responsibility comes great territory."- Uncle Ben, the Dylan translation
"Go get him Garf" 😂 7:01
Andrew Garfield killed it as Peter Parker and Spider-Man you can tell he loves the character with all his heart he is proper fanboy of the character like most of us are, he said it himself its not just a fictional character its a symbol amd he wore it with pride
23:01 that’s his personality though, and one of this spider-man’s charms
If Andrew is moderately attractive than I must be a bridge troll
Me... with a spider tattoo..... definately have been turned on and dated some sus people 🙄Dylan back at it again with the predictions
Will you watch the Anne with an e series but only the first and last episodes
20:39 lmaooo his face
20:39 LMAOO
Dylan you definitely should watch the spiderman into the spiderverse and across the spiderverse
The second one is even better! If you haven’t seen it, that would’ve been a better reaction because there’s more shocking moments. (Iykyk)
Bitten by the love bug dylan.
I think he has seen the first tom holland movie and just thinks he didn't cause there was no uncle ben
This movie was directed by Marc WEBB and I think that’s great.
"Iv been bitten"  "So have I"...... BITTEN MEANS :LOVE BUG  in other words, 'iv been bitten by the love bug to"  That or she means bitten by crabs....and it's a heinous STD  I'd have to look into more.
People hated this movie just because of nostalgia and that's it he still stays the closest from comics and the best Spiderman and Peter parker those who don't like the amazing franchise clearly haven't read Spiderman comics
"People like it so much" "Everybody's favourite movie"  yeah, definitely it is 2023. if it was back in 2013 there was me here and two other fans rooting for Andrew's Spiderman HAHAHAHAH
LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND MOVIE REVIEW
LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND MOVIE REVIEW
LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND MOVIE REVIEW
Dylan just watch Into the Spiderverse, kay
pls do the new one to like its soo good
Seems kind of weird that him being a cop says it’s too dangerous stay away. I feel if they show more villians like this then it would be warranted, but right now they have the same type work and fight the same bad guys. And it’s not like the dad was staying away you know.
Wait what the hell, he has webs coming out the back of his neck??? Does that ever come back up again?
I remember hearing that tobey is a good spider man, andrew is a good Peter, and is Tom is a good combination of both.
I can’t wait till you watch amazing spider man 2
18:07 she’s talking abt bitten by the love bug😭
Terrible film
So….. how do I slide into the dm’s Dylan…?
Dylan said imagine he ran out of webbing, when Peter threw Gwen out of the window it almost made me cry lol, it to soon man, too soon lol.
love Andrew Garfield
The Kurtis Conner joke made me cackle and now I want to see a collab
Can we please just change one of the most iconic lanes to Dylans version please?  With great responsibility comes great territory.
Bitten by the LOVE BUG Dylan🙄
Dylan, i was 90% convinced we had the same taste and thoughts about entertainment, but this video has literally sealed the deal. I hate watched unicorn academy and i NEED to see you do it too 😭
dylan.. I am so down to hear your commentary on Unicorn Academy...
The two actors were dating for real that's why they were so cute together. This is the best spiderman movie hands down
Literally spit out my food at dylan humping the chair 😂
Dylan, can you please watch The Amazing Spider-Man 2 please
Me yelling “bitten by a LOVE BUG” hoping Dylan would get to that conclusion too at 18:13
I had a rough few weeks. Glad I still have a few of these Dylan videos to watch. :)
Dylan, the New York subway station has seen crazier things than a man sticking to the ceiling. That is why no one had a reaction
The amazing spider man 2 was my faaavourite I don’t know why I think I like movies that hurt me
Are we really not gonna talk about "DUMB COATS WITHOUT SLEEVES"
Dylan you gotta play the quarry it’s kinda like until dawn
Bitten by the love bug
I’ve always said that the three live action versions of Spider-Man we’ve had perfectly fit the eras in which they were released. Like you said, this one is very era defined for having that indie, less commercial vibe- it’s very 2014 Tumblr-coded, which is definitely one of the reasons why those of us who were in their teens/ early 20s when these movies came out loved them so much!   I love the other versions too- I grew up with the Raimi trilogy (I vividly remember the buzz around the third one when it was revealed that Venom would be featured in it), and I love Tom’s more teen-like version, but the TASM films will always be my definitive Spider-Man
I love you, that’s it
You should watch the second one too
6:14 the very subtle mention of kurtis conner (who is one of my fave youtubers) that dylan (who is also one of my fave youtubers) made, made me so happy idk why LMAO
Dylan making an Easy A joke but not a Rosette Stone one? 😂
I want the Road to Eldorado commentary so bad
Bitten by the love bug is what they were referring to lmao also do the sequel!
😮‍💨 One, She was “bitten”  by a love bug~ 🤣 Get it? And it’s “With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility” Not Territory Dylan!
Jesus Christ died and rose again. Repent before it’s too late ❤✝️
Bitten by the LOVE BUG Dylan! That's what Gwen was referring to
Biten “ by the Love Bug” It was a corny joke.
bit by the love bug?
She was bitten by a love bug you dork lol
My dad's wife saw you on screen and thought you were James Franco LOL
unicorn academy first and last would be fire
“With great responsibility comes great territory”😂😂😂😂
Everyone trashed these movies until No Way Home gave Andrew Garfield’s Peter Parker the redemption he deserved. Suddenly, when you put him in the same room as the other two celebrated Spider-Mans, everyone could see how talented he was as an actor and how impactful his story was.  The three of them complimented each other so well, with Toby McGuire being the logical and experienced older brother, Tom Holland being the optimistic and untested younger brother, and Andrew Garfield being the slightly chaotic but masking his trauma middle child. SO. GOOD.
Take a shot every time Dylan says “My guy” 😂
andrew & tom are deffff my fave😍😍
Me watching this just for dylan to see this scene @ 14:35!!!!
This movie did few things the others did not and that's why i like this version a lot. First Andrew Garfield is a way better actor and although has these moments of comedy still are well excuted but the thing is that he didn't seem like a dumb boy with powers, he was a teenager in distress with emotional voids, confused and angry but chose to do the right thing at end. I think he gave the character depth which i didn't get with Tom Holland and with Tobby i only got it later in his adult life as the movies went on but no at the beginning. And the next thing is that the relationship between Gwen and Peter felt more organic and supportive also it added value to the storyline cause she had a mayor rol more than just being safe, the chemistry was sooo good.
you have to watch the second one!!!!!
every time dylan is shocked by how strong andrew!peter is, idk why but i love that so much
Let’s all remember the quote from Uncle Ben, ‘with great responsibility comes great territory’
Bitten by the love bug
honestly everyone being like whatever just another tuesday at so much of what's happening is because this is in new york and people really do be that nonchalant 😭
DYLAN, i absolutely love your marvel movie commentaries. please please please do more !!
I grew up with Andrew’s Spider-Man movies, & he will always be my favorite Spider-Man hands down!
Garfield's Peter has always been my favorite Spiderman for a while but I got into a Miles Morales brain rot recently so this gives me so much nostalgia
this was honestly so entertaining
Bitten by the lovebug
Dylan needs to remember that this all takes place in NYC where people see crazy stuff all the time. A weird teenager doing spider things on a subway is pretty easy to ignore lol
I was ready for unicorn academy 😪
The reason I love the Amazing Spider-Man franchise so much is because this was my reintroduction to Spider-Man. I did kinda watch Tobey’s Spider-Man movies but I was still quite young and the Green Goblin kinda freaked me out but I did watch an animated Spider-Man show and love the character of Spider-Man. When the Amazing Spider-Man came out I wanted to watch it and I looooved it, it was officially my first superhero movie but didn’t watch the other marvel films like avengers until I think 2014 and now I’m obsessed with all things marvel all because of Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man .
I came to hear Dylan yell at Disney about the space bar only 😂
18:14 bitten by a love bug, Dylan 🤣
20:20 I like spiders but that ain't me, Dylan, please 😭
This is actually a really good movie.
I think it’s mad adorable that Dylan found it odd that no one questioned Peter Parker hanging from the ceiling of the subway. Like, that scene shows that New Yorkers have done seen it all on the subway. 😂
🦄
No Dylan. People don’t rave about this movie. The 12 year old girls that just founds out about Andrew from watching No Way Home rave about this movie🤣
You need to watch greatest showmen and the notebook😂😂
Dylan lost his opportunity to do the Easy A joke when she said that she tutors Flash
Plz do the Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. IK you don't take suggestions but just pretend it was your idea.
Dylan you idiot… bitten by the love bug hahaha
she was bitten by the love bug
You should be thrown in jail for the Easy F joke
Are you ever gona get that nose ring for real? Like you seem pretty committed to it. Might be time to put a ring on it. 😎
watch seinfeld next please
Dylan the movie thanksgiving has Addison Rae in it and she did not do bad. It’s still in theaters but maybe it’s something worth checking out when it releases
the easy f joke kills me
i’m NOT RECOMMENDING AT ALL, but sometimes i just wonder, if Dylan watched certain movies or shows, and i wish i could know his opinion on them. like watching jjk now and just dying to have Dylan reacting on the whole Shibuya Arc, BUT ITS NOT A RECOMMENDATION PLEASE DONT PUT ME ON A CROSS
petition for Dylan to do the second part !!
Very nice
You need to do Purple Hearts please
My reasoning for liking Andrew's spiderman more than the others is because he acts more like a spider.       he's also HOT
I don’t know if anyone else has answered the question but Gwen was bitten by the love bug 😂
Dylan !!! Please watch Ready or not !!
I mean this with the upmost respect but you look like if dr mike and hiccup haddock had a love child
He needs to feel the emotional trauma of the sequel and I need to see his reaction
I just realized Gwen's little brother is baby Eric from Santa Clarita Diet!
Watch RRR pls
Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man has been my favorite since I was like 8 yrs old. I didn’t even know about the original till middle school tbh. Also, I’m from Brooklyn and I frequented Queens a lot growing up and Andrew Garfield definitely brings a New Yorker vibe to Spider-Man that I personally think Tobey and Tom didn’t do as well as he did. The wit and confidence he had under the suit was one that was so New York energy, i shit you not. He had me sold. Ppl need to respect the Amazing Spider-Man movies more
how do you edit/compile these videos? like software wise. or how did you do it when you first started? i know you went to school for it, but it looks like a lot of very hard work
12:58 “coats without sleeves”
wow,such a fantastic movie....this movie is so amazing..
The fact that nobody said yes to unicorn academy is disappointing lol!
Wicho fine ass
Bitten by the love bug dylan 🤦🏼‍♀️
This is my favorite Spider-Man movie of all time.
can you please watch the other zoey
Ok, but I laughed at the easy A jokes
"An easy F"... lol THAT WAS GOLDDDDDD
I wanna watch unicorn academy too!:D
I just finished rewatching tasm 2 a few weeks ago. Andrew Garfield is definitely my favorite Spider-Man!  "Go get'em, Garf" Okay, that's my new nickname for Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man. Dylan, you're amazing!
wait, hold on. i would be down for unicorn academy 👺
Hey Dylan can u watch "The Menu" i heard its good but im scared to watch it alone lmao
When she said “so have I” she meant by the love bug I believe 😭
I dunno if anyone explained it but it's a common phrase to say you've been 'bitten' by a love bug or just love. So she probably was thinking he was making a cutesy confession so was like 'me to!'
I agree Dylan and I haven’t even watched it yet
She’s been bitten by the love bug Dylan oh my god
Bitten by the love bug
Oo! Here for it!
"bitten" by the love bug lol
I DIED at "with great responsibility comes great territory" line lmaoo, that was too good
top tier spiderman
why is dylan so… idk him in this video is doing smth. WAIT DID HE GET A TAN?????
Dylan had the perfect reactions to Uncle Ben talking about Gwen being on Peter’s computer. 🤣
You would love Who Framed Rodger Rabbit Dylan
hes right abt the spider girl thing i like spiders and being stalked
"With great responsibility, comes great territory" -Dylan, 2023
Dylan, I recommend you watch Sheroes next, since you like watching bad movies😂
i have 5 spiders as pets... I do NOT think stalking is attractive. .... stalk me.... and I will send my spiders after you ;)
the fact that you didnt watch ATSV  is a crime
WHO WANTS DYLAN TO REACT TO ANDREW SECOND SPIDERMAN MOVIE  👇👇
Bitten by the love bug is what she meant
netflix does that on purpose to force you to use there app, it works fine on that
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
this is ur best video 😭😭🩷
Dylan has nightmares about that mf disney spacebar
I recommend you do a commentary on the movie 9
Now I need the second one. Not in a month, not in week. Right. Now.
You should do mad max fury road
He should watch legend of the guardians he’ll think it’s about cute owls then boom war and suffering
Sally Field, incredible actress. So many good movies under her belt. But I know her more from Brothers and sisters. ^^u
I'm almost 25 and I have things on my list like Unicorn Academy, actually I'm going to add that one to my list /genuine
dooo a reaction to the sequel too please!!
i am still not over gwen's death
gosh dylan, i hope u see the 2nd part n cryyyy
Dylan needs to bring back the episode series 😂😂😂
3:54 omg isn’t that the same actress who plays the mom in the Barbie movie?
Dylan just for the record Gwen Stacy’s dad is the police chief… The police chief in New York makes bank… He’s like on TV and shit lol saying this as a New Yorker 😂
love ur vids Dylan ty! But don't forget guys to boycott Marvel & Disney. Free PS.
You NEED to watch Grease or One of us is lying
That train scene would not stand out to a New Yorker. Not every dude attached to the ceiling is Spider-Man 😅
18:14 "bitten by a love bug" is a thing
Can someone recommend me a really really bad movie that makes you laugh so much bcs it's so bad idk why I just feel like it.
why did the last easy A joke actually get me laughing out loud. my boy
You know what? I think like the tv ad better than the ad roll
6:54 he's a great actor of Bollywood rip ❤❤ he's a legend
Cackled lil 2 loud at the kurtis joke 😂
PLEASE watch the movie “The Village” i need to know your opinion on it 🙏🏼
Can you watch my fault?
That guy who’s kid Spiderman saved on the bridge is Ponyboy from the Outsiders so no I would not forget his face 😆
Honestly surprised by the lack of comments on the scene where he makes his webs. (My favorite scene of this whole movie besides the Stan Lee cameo)
I’ve missed this editing style!
Dylan can you watch Teen wolf please. I think you'll like Stiles a lot.
I'm just going to say this totally unprompted: I got the hots for Dylan - there, I said it. I'll leave now, bye!
Bitten by the love bug, I think she means
18:13 Bitten by the looveee bug Dylan!!
Dylan my guy I neet to see you watch part 2
You hadn’t watched amazing spiderman before??????? I don’t think I can trust you anymore Dylan 😭
Do watch the 2nd one
True best spiderman
Dylan, she meant Love Bug. She’s been bitten by the love bug
Havent watched it yet, but THIS is my favourite Spider-man film. Adored it since I was a kid and I cant wait to see your reaction
I will never get over how irritated he gets with the space bar 😂 it’s hilarious to me…   This commentary was so much fun to watch and I can’t wait for him to watch Spiderman into the spider verse
he is my favorite spiderman for a reason
If he doesn't review the sequel I will cry myself to sleep for the rest of my days.
10% spiderman 90% spacebar 😂
18:16 love bug
That easy a joke was Superbad
I NEED DYLANS REACTION TO SPIDERMAN INTO THE SPIDERVERSE I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS
And dead pool
Mb meet the blacks
All imma say plz watch meat the black
bitten by the love bug I think is what she means
The way dylan violated the entire moral and biggest catchphrase of the Spiderman franchise in a single sentence is beyond me  "With great responsibility comes great territory"
We should dislike this video to show how much we understand and appreciate Dylan. 😂
Bitten by the love bug bro.... Re: so have I
Adding on to Dylan's joke, if Gwen Stacy was tutoring Peter it would be an easy A..(because Emma Stone was in a movie called Easy A) It was funnier in my head Dylan hope I did you proud!
I think Dylan should redo to Hunger Games franchise especially now that TBOSBAS has come out  😳😳😳
“I’ve been bitten” by the love bug! Come on Dylan you’re better than this!
don’t want to be a hater but am I the only one who feels like dylan’s commentaries used to be so much funnier akdkd idk if it used to be more subtle jokes or what but I think he relies on the “making funny noises and hoping it lands” shtick alot more for a while now
Wow Dylan. I wonder what circles you've been travelling in - The Amazing Spider-Man series isn't highly praised in my world. Perhaps, I've just been travelling in nerdy circles. The first one has generally good reviews, but it also has a distinct number of detractors, while the second has been highly criticised, at least in more critiquing circles - It's not said to be awful, but has been distinctly defined as a bad film, or okay at best. These movies are very fun and even though I think you're a fairly critical guy, I think you'll greatly enjoy both of them. One of the things that's nice about this series as opposed to the other two Spider-Man ones, is that it's stylised - The movies make an effort to be visually stunning in a standout, stylish way.  I hope you'll do a commentary on the second one.  By the way Dylan, even though I think this is a good movie when putting on a critiquing cap, I definitely think Peter throwing the ball and bending the goalpost shouldn't be in the film - The basketball glass shattering can be bypassed, but this should definitely call suspicious attention to Peter - The length he throws the ball is also abnormally massive.
I LOVED the fact that you too appreciated the fear-of-little-knives scene. I rewatched that part (14:27) like 4 times cause your laugh made me laugh so much 😂
When Gwen said “so have i” she’s referring to the “love bug”
Spider-man strength is soooo powerful. He pulls his punches, if he punched someone at full force, he'd literally break their jaw and kill them LMAOO. Him shattering the glass when playing basketball made sense
You should watch the first and last episode of Hemlock Grove. Its so bad but I like it
u need to watch the second movie
Dylan should watch the hangover
Please react to the movie Missing
You've been doing this channel how long? I watched this channel once upon a time, & realized it might be a while before you get to my show. I wait. 2 years later. I cnt believe it. You STILL haven't watched BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER?! STILL?! I'll check back in 2 more years. Til the , I'm rewatched your 50 shades of Grey videos. My favorites ❤😂
Dylan needs to watch scream
Watch first and last episode of Loki series
I know Dylan doesn't do recommendations ... But, I'm gonna take a risk. I am surprised he hasn't done a commentary on a certain 'Regency Era Shondaland Show' on Netflix. I mean it is right up his alley.
The easy A jokes need to stop HAHAHAHA
Oh man I'm only 8 mins and 47 secs in but you already have me cracking up so hard 😂 I love your reactions and how fun you are to watch!
dylan ignoring gwen saying shes a senior and sticking w his idea of her being a junior is so funny to me
i'm so happy rn. this is my favorite spider-man movieeeee :)
Dylan you should also watch the second one that ones even better and electros a great villain
"With a great responsibility comes great territory" dylan 2023 😂😂
she got bit by the love bug. great commentary, I'm glad you love AGs Spider Man
Nah bro we need a Unicorn Academy commentary NOW. You can't just leave us hanging like that😔
One of the things I really like about TASM is that Peter told Gwen his secret very early. It prevents Gwen from being sidelined or being oblivious.
Dylan YOU HAVE TO DO HACKSAW RIDGE
TASM version is my favorite and one of the biggest factors for this is that they really explained why this Peter Parker was able to get the powers from the spider, not just brushing off that “I got bit by a radioactive spider” and we’re supposed to just roll with it 😂 like you can actually understand spiderman with this version whether you’ve seen the older movies or read the comics or not at all.
Dylan, you have to do Once Upon a Time - the first and the last episode! :-)
you and kurtis give me the same humor vibes, a collab would be so funny
„Ooooooooh..🥰🥰🥰was that sexual assault“💀💀💀
Dylan, I know you like roasting movies but you should really watch  Encanto and Elemental and the spiderman movie...it's amazing
It’s SPIDER MAN . SPIDER MAN . TU NE CHURAYA MERAY DIL KA CHAIN.
I’m gonna start saying “with great responsibility comes great territory”💀
18:20  Im gonna assume she meant she was bitten by the loooovvee bug .. 😅🙌🏻
OUR FAV SPIDER-MAN 🥹❤️
The best Spider-Man no one can convince me otherwise
a LOVE BUG DYLAN. Bitten by a LOVE BUG
bitten by the love bug Dylan, come on get it together lololol
Bro looks like pewdiepie sounds like him and also does reaction vids😂 clone alert
Ah my favorite reaction channel hosted by hiccup
I watch this and I realise that lizard never used his claws to stab garf did he ? like what do you have those claws for huh ? to make chemical bombs ?
“We can chill with some of these effects, jah?”
I love all of the Spider-Man’s they are all good in their own way I think it’s just because I grew up with the original it’s just too iconic
18:09 bitten by the love bug!!
18:00 bitten by the love bug, Dylan. It's an old phrase.
i feel like you should do a bridgerton commentary
DYLAN DO THE SECOND ONE TOO
8:12 Dylan idk if you noticed hut pretty much every spider man is set in NY. The subway might as well be a sci fi movie 😂😂😂
watch the first and last episode of Loki I genuinely need to see your reaction
this is genuinely one of my favorite commentaries by dylan ever😂i’ve thoroughly enjoyed these last 31 minutes of screen time😌🤌
I'm sorry did you just call THE Andrew Garfield ...moderately attractive ?!?!?!?
Dylan the kissing booth 4 has come out
She has been “bitten” by the “love bug”
what 1:11 Dylan doesn't know is that I would enjoy nothing more than watching him watch Unicorn Academy
29:42 I HATE YOOOOOUUUU😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
please do kung fu panda 2 and 3 its worth it
22:53 - that was unfortunate foreshadowing.....
Dylan, about that botched joke….did you know that Emma made a movie called Easy A? Stay thirsty, my friend
DYLAN YOU HAVE TO WATCH THROUGH MY WINDOW 1 AND 2
14:11 Dylaaaaan😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hey Dylan I know you already have other things coming but for upcoming stuff please steer clear from using Disney, they are currently supporting the genocide happening in Palestine with money so we are boycotting them🙏🏾
can u do red white and royal blue next?? you’re gonna love it !
In my opinion Andrew Garfield is the best spiderman because he plays the awkward teenage outcast while also having that smartass playful spider persona with a great sense of humor. Like Tom Holland is great at the nerd peter parker but he also just happens to be very strong, his playfulness as spiderman doesn't stand out as much in my opinion and same with Toby, he's more serious most of the time. But i still love them all❤  Edit:Also someone in the comments pointed out that Andrew moves more spider-like while the others don't and it fits better and i have to agree with that, also fits his powers more
I feel very attacked during minute 20:15.
Nice one
Why can’t I tag ol Kurt boy 🥲
Love this video so much 😭🫶but Dylan leave the ugly drop shadow at ooga booga pls
"Day 76 of"💀💀 DO THE DUNGENS AND DRAGONS💀💀💀 MOVIE NEXT PLSSSSSSSS💀
Very nice movie🎉🎉❤
Pleaaaaaaseee watch My Fault
“she’ll be fine there’s a sequel” YIKESSSS lol
Now I need your commentary of across the spider verse 😭🙏
It’s hard for me to hate movies but these are just are so bad and Andrew is a terrible Spider-Man imo
i cannot believe dylan knows who kurtis is😭
Personally think this movie can get pretty boring, love the 2nd movie though
I think she meant that she was also bitten by a love bug. 🤷🏻‍♀️ At least that's what i thought she meant.
Andrew Garfield is such an underrated Spider-man and the characters are portrayed how you would expect them or even better. I'm so mad they didn't continue production on the third one.
18:04 BITTEN BY A LOVE BUG DYLAN SHE WAS BITTEN BY THE LOVE BUG
they probably are fixing all the problems now theyre getting boycotted
What I love the most about all the Spider-Man movies is that they adapted Peter's personality to the generation of teenagers of the time, that's why the three of them are so different. I love Toby's because it was the first superhero movie I watched and for a long time, Spider-Man was the only superhero I kind of watched. I love Tom's because Homecoming was the reason I got into Marvel. And I love Andrew's because I was a teenager when those movies came out so I related more to his personality.
She meant she was so bitten by a love bug
Tazm 3
AHHH I LOVE THIS MOVIE Andrew and Dylan??? It’s perfect
Okay Im a fan of Dylan but now I’m even more of a fan that he likes Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man ❤
only dylan would edit out spider-verse to universe cause he accidentaly said it.
People do not rave about Andrews spiderman dont even joke about that. His Peter is somehow like this jock, angry bully character and its just confusing
Thumbs up
I think dylan could be a really good voice actor lol. maybe like one of the characters on Rick and Morty.
i saw that easy A joke coming like a min before u even said it, it still landed
“He’s not alone!”  You never announce yourself!!!!  Don’t do it!!  😂😂😂😂
She was bitten by a love bug
I never get tired of Dylan fighting with Disney+
she was bitten by a love bug😭
Dylan needs to see Spiderman No Way Home!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice
good
Dylan, Gwen was bit by the Love Bug 🐞
she was bitten by the love bug!!!
So ya when you press the space button after you click the full screen button you goota make sure you press play other wise it wont work i think its stupid too and it annoys me so much but as someone who watches shows and skips the intro after watching a few times that usually helps and will let you use the space bar to pause and play after hitting skip 🤷‍♀️ idk its dumb 😂😂😂
The continuous beef with the disney space bar is one oof my favorite things. Also Gwen thought he meant he was bitten by a love bug
20:08 i’m terrified of spiders but this is me😭
L
ahh no unicorn? ;(
i absolutely loved that joke you made! hilarious 😂
i hope you watch number 2
Dylan and his dad jokes
Does knowing so much about movies, ruin the experience? I’m generally curious
9:42 he never said “she is your screensaver” Dylan come on lol
No.. Dylan. It’s “with great power comes great responsibility”✋😔
Nah, Andrew Garfield is just a tad too handsome and charming for me to believably play neighborhood dork Peter, I prefer the awkwardness of Tobey from the original three movies :P
👍👍👍👍
Garbage movie
Gwen means she’s been bitten by the love bug. :)
0:07 is that...? a new shirt? 👀
Am I wrong that this version of Gwen and Peter are in college? Not highschool?
you've seen far from home and not HOMECOMING???????? JAIL
I love Andrew as Spider-Man.
is it just me or does Dylan look buffier?
So ready for Unicorn Academy.
Ok let's be real ok u were teasing Gwen when she internship at Osborne but when mcu Spiderman is doing same thing with iron Man lol I 😂 just can't.
I’m so happy dylan laughed at the knife scene, that scene is a clear representation of the real comic book spiderman
Nice movie for all people
kurtis really had a glow up
I LOVE Andrew Garfield as Spider-man. He is cool and funny and I love the role of Gwen Stacy. Mary Jane was super annoying in the first Spider-man trilogy. I do think that he was the best choice for Spider-man. He looks super nerdy but also kinda attractive. I absolutely love his humour and his whole character.  Toby was fine but kinda cringe (sry ) 😅 And Tom Holland is just not like Spider-man anymore. He‘s like a big superhero and not the friendly spider from the neighborhood.
Im just shocked that Dylan never did an Ice Age comentary.
I remember recommending him this movie 3 years ago as a new troublemaker, not knowing he hates recommendations. Now here we are. A long wait but worth it nonetheless! >.<
You didn't talk about the very interesting side plot auf Peter Parker and Flash Thompson becoming friends.  It starts the flash inviting Peter to his bullying and Peter calling him Eugene when he tells him to stop. Later they have this Basketball beat up incident. Then Flash gives Peter His condolences for uncle Ben's death. Later the Lizard attacks at the school. The look Flash gives Peter...   He knows! In the end Flash wears a Spider-Man T-Shirt and from the comments one could conclude that he knows who he is talking to.
dylan doing my fav movie is a cultural moment in my mind
bro just watch.
“Great responsibility comes with great territory” 😂
Andrews sense of humor during this movie is what made me love his spiderman. Just that smart ass type of spiderman that i have always wanted lol
When Gwen said she was bitten too she meant by the love bug. It's a common saying to say someone was bitten by the lovebug.
Very nice video
I can’t tell if Dylan is working out and gaining muscles or just buying tighter shirts
Not me screaming “she was bitten by the LOVEBUG” while watching this…as if he can hear me…
hope you do the next one! and then the new ones i would love to see your reaction to them !
I truly understand why a lot of people love Toby as spiderman and see him as the correct one, and I think Tom is doing an incredible job with the character as well, but for me, Andrew is 100% the best Spiderman there is, and the first movie is for sure my fav. spiderman movie, the second movie definitely has its flaws, but with what Andrew had to work with he still managed to make himself the best spiderman in my book.
"Where were we?" "Oh yeah, Your parents didnt love you." lmao 🤣💀
unicorn acadmy!!!
i NEEED movie 2 as well please and thank you
EXACTLY!!! i felt so bad for gwens mom and brothers! Imagine the dad whos the breadwinner and the super smart sister whos abt to go to university……
Boycott Disney 🍉
Dylan she got bit by the love bug
❤❤❤❤nice video
Please do Amazing Spider-Man 2 next time!
Nice movie
Why didn't Dylan asked our help for chosing the lights color?? Betrayal😂
I'm so down for Unicorn academy 😎
This is probably my least favorite Spider-man but I still like the movies. I think they give a different feel then the other. I feel like this is a Rom-Com in a Spider-man movie.
Good video
"this better be a prank...he better be bullied"
The wish dragon is actually a really cute movie. It was a "random click" movie on netflix
Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man and I will die, rot and decompose on that hill.
DYLAN HOW have you not watched this movie before this video if I didn’t think you were an absolute goon before I do now 😭   **edit: okay, I actually live for your sweet reactions to gwen and Parker and outlandish bits. ur still a goon tho ❤️
I’d love to have Dylan watch”rat race” but it’s a bit dumb lol and maybe a bit controversial for now a days
She was trying to say that she has been bitten by a love bug
1:53 BY THE LOVE BUG!! 😝 @dylanisintrouble
I would so wanna see a Dylan commentary on the movie simple favor with Blake lively
30:57 the like boton flash in colors??
Garfield got fired before the 3rd movie
Bitten by the love bug Dylan… by the love bug
am i going crazy with the fake green bubly cans in the background?
Dylan we aren’t gonna rest until we get a unicorn academy commentary
Hey Dylan what happened to that young adult book you were writing?
Dylan you should definetly watch dragonfly from Superhero Movie HAHAHHAA!!!!
The amazing Spider-Man is the worst Spider-Man movie we all know Spider-Man 2 is the best
The way Gwen literally talked to Flash about tutoring in the beginning of this movie but I had to sit through him working through that easy a joke was a travesty
This movie is a family favorite so we watched your commentary for our pizza and a movie night. Thanks for the laughs ❤
I really want his to do the 2nd one just to see his reaction to Gwen's death. That shit shook me as a kid
I don’t know why but I’m in the mood for a bubbly
No lol this is the worst movie ever, the worst of the spider verse. This is my opinion obviously and ofc some may disagree but it is still my opinion.
tobey is the best peter, andrew is the best spider-man and tom is the best as both🤪
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
23:16 🤣😭
Favorite spider -man
bold of dylan to assume that those teenagers would give a fuck about seeing a kid fucking twist an end zone metal. today i almost got hit by a car and the only thing i thought after that was about the test im gonna fail next week.
Yes yes yes Dylan I've been asking for this for years so you finally did one of my suggestions
Review Ang Lee's Hulk movie
that's right Dylan, best spider man movies so true !!
The way I added Unicorn Academy to my watch list lmao
For your next first and last video, can you please do "Loki" :)
But no joke I really want to see you react to the Miles Morales movies 😭
Wait?? Dylan wears glasses ⁉️😮😭
What on earth is wrong with ur Disney + Dylan 😭
"With great responsibility comes great territory" - Uncle Ben, probably
27:56 petition to make this a meme🤣🤣💀💀 had me dying
when the dad said "he's not alone" I teared up lol
I was 8 when the second movie came out but damn her death still hurt 😫💔
please watch the second one cause i need your reaction to the chimney scene!!!
Can someone tell this guy to stop talking so much i cant hear the movie
watch the second one
20:54 subway scene you gotta remember it's NYC. Alot of shit happens in the subway... I reason that's why noone really thought twice abt it
18:21 she was bitten by "the love bug"
Normal people: Vest Dylan: Dumb coat without sleeves
I am obsessed with the Bubbly placement. lol
No one gonna notice the added in Bubbly cans in the background? For sure thought it was gonna be a sponsor
“SAAAAAAMM!!”
I know you dont want suggestion but ple watch The other zoey. You also kinda look like Drew starkey. Love you videos
I always thought the movie with Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst was titled „The Amazing Spiderman“  Are there two?
Yeah I literally watched toby and tom holland and skipped over the amazing spider man somehow
I've never seen the amazing spiderman movies, but from watching dylan's commentary they seem really fun. Not sure why they received so much hate.
stop trying to make "easy A" happen, its not going to happen  lmao
Oh man!! Irrfan khan...I completely forgot he was in this!
"great responsibility comes with great territory" 😭😭😭😭😭
Im calling Dylans bluff, I want to see a video of him reacting to Unicorn Academy
Damn, I miss her.
Yes with great responsibility comes great territory, words to live by.
I love this movie!!! Don’t like the second one though
This wasnt my favorite spiderman
you better post a reaction of TASM 2 because I've been rewatching your movie commentaries nonstop 💀 I need TASM 2 and I can be at peace LOL
Bro really wanted to get that Easy A joke in😂😂😂
one word: The Garf
20:17 Dylan lmao 🗣️🗣️
need a side by side of him and felix
im down for unicorn acadamey (idk how to spell)
lets be careful with jokes about stalking that make it seem less harmful
Got a whiplash seeing irrfaan Khan in this
Part 2!!!
Dumb an dumber
Around 18:05 love bug Dylan… love bug
good
fabulos work
I  want to See you Watch Unicorn Academy
PLEASE UNICORN ACADEMY
Quote of the century ”The great responsibility comes with great territory” Dylan 2023  12:33
OMG YES THIS ONE IS THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE
Sad to hear that Dylan has never been “bitten” by the love bug…
i love dylan he is so funny man
Turns out Dylan has never heard of "Lovebug" by Jonas Brothers. That's the only reason I know that term 😆
😂 dying because dylan doesn't understand that she was talking about being bitten by the love bug, I'm pretty sure that's a saying and I'm pretty sure that's what she meant when she said "so have i"
PLEASE WATCH THE SECOND ONEEE
20:39 I replayed this reaction at least 10 times. It’s so fucking funny
Can’t wait for Unicorn Academy
you should do commentary on the next amazing spider man movie
I normally love your content dude but this was 75% you complaining about your chair and Disney Plus' user interface 😂
Dylan, you can literally play Milo from Atlantis.
with great responsibility comes great territory is my new life motto
17:47  Bitten by a love bug
4:10 As someone who was in yearbook in high school, we had to ask consent to take someone's picture (unless it was like a big crowd/event where asking would have been impossible)  Then again, I was in yearbook only a couple years ago and I'm pretty sure this movie is like 10-20 years old
I have a lot of nostalgic love for Tobey Maguire's spiderman, but Andrew's is the one that feels the MOST like spiderman. I remember playing the video games on playstation when I was a kid where you swing from cranes and fight lizard guys in the sewers, and spiderman had such a quippy attitude. They really portrayed that video game feel in this movie and with Andrew's acting.
people rave about this? x to doubt
dylan repeating the same grading joke over and over again eventually had me laughing
my favorite movie commentator 🤝🏻 my favorite Spider-Man
Andrew Garfield improv’d the “small knives” scene!!! You can tell he just had so much fun in this role which is why I think so many people love his spider-man.
you don’t understand how happy this made meeeee🥹🫶❤️
i need a part 2 this was too good
This was exceptionally funny Dylan 😂
... so, who's gonna tell him? Dylan, even if you don't film it, you should watch the rest of the series.
that's my favorite spider man!!!
Bitten by a love bug! 💕
I really hope he does the second one
Please watch the second oneeee
Ngl, I adore Andrew gardield as the spiderman and loved the movies
My BF reacting to my BF’s movie!!!
YOU BETTER WATCH THE SECOND ONE
17:50 She was bitten by the love bug! I'm pretty sure that's what she meant.
How did you pass right by the animated spiderman like that?!
Do TASM 2!!
Give this video an Easy A 👏
dylan appreciating the small knives joke has been the best part of this
in my opinion the first amazing spiderman is the absolutely best spiderman, above both the Tobey one and Tom one but the amazing spiderman 2 is my least favorite, so yeah, they crushed it on the first one but the second one was a real disappointment
"bitten" by a lovebug, duh!
Love how it took Dylan this long to actually realize how the disney+ controls worked 😂
Dylan: I've done callbacks to jokes that didn't even work in the first place Me: MEATPACK
YESSSSSS one of my favourite movies!!!!
Love the song
Always remember kids, With great responsibility comes with great territory.
Completely unrelated- I hope you enjoyed the finale of Attack on Titan Dylan!!
Wow Dylan! Congrats on being '#47 on Tending", that's awesome :)  I've been subscribed to your channel for a a few years now, so it's been nice to see your channel grow. I really enjoy your videos, and no matter what your reacting to you always make me laugh, even when I'm having a rough day. You are one of my fave YouTubers and your content is great.  Keep up the great work :)
NEED A PART 2 REACTION NEXT MONDAY!!!!!
Not me yelling “it’s a love bug” while Dylan tries to figure out why Gwen said she’s bitten 🙈
Only 22 likes?
boycott disney and free p@lestine (you can always watch disney movies illegally)
Give us the next movie!!!
17:59 She was bitten by the "love bug," I imagine
Dylan, I'm gonna need you to stop profiling chicks with spider tattoos. I feel attacked right now, and it's kinda hurting my feelings. 💔🕷
Absolute icon of a man
I don't care what anyone says Andrew's Spiderman is the best one
I would watch u I one academy with u Dylan
All bystanders ignoring the spider powers are chalked up to how NYers handle weird shit they see. Pretend it don’t exist and we good. 🤣🤣
You’re entitled to your favourite but all the Spider-Man’s did a bang up job
Ngl, I didn't really catch that "Be good." parallel at the end until you said something about it, Dylan. Like, damn
you need to do spiderverse though u'll love it its so fucking good
why are we pretending people liked the amazing Spiderman before the cameo in the newer movie ? cuz I was FIGHTING,  and I mean fighting for my life defending it every time someone mentions Spiderman.
Never clicked faster on a video. Love you, Dylan! Always picking the right movies!
Andrew is and always will be my Peter Parker/ Spider-Man I grew up with Toby but Andrew just nails every aspect of the character
Idc this will forever be my favorite Spider man🖤 Andrew just gets it.
Love the commentary! Thank you! And I just wanted to say, that the Spider-man across the spider verse is second part of Spider-man into the spider verse.
In my opinion, Toby was a great Peter Parker & Andrew is a great Spiderman. This series got so much hate, but I actually really like this version.
Watch The other Zoey!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me: "ahahaha OH G O D I would *Kill Myself*" Dylan: "Oh My God, I would Kill Myself"  Its so satisfying to be on the same page as a pre-recorded video.
oh wow he enjoyed it hehe
the quirkiness of both emma and andrew made this movie the best
This was one of your best commentaries! So much fun. 😊
i've never seen anyone WANT a marvel funny ha ha quip during a serious moment
This one is my favorite too! I just related to this Peter so much more. He’s not cool, he’s awkward, girls will talk to him, but not date him, he seems chill, but he’s secretly lonely and shy. I must have said “Yup, been there” five time the first time I saw it. I didn’t care about seeing the origin stuff again cause it’s my favorite superhero and I had hopes that the next one will be it’s own thing(not talking about that). Gwen and Peter are the best superhero couple I’ve ever seen, and let’s not forget he’s actually funny here. I used to feel like if we took the cast from the amazing films, put them in simple stories like the Raimi films, use the effects from these films, and these were the first Spidey films, we’d have a perfect Spiderman movie series. That being said, I’m excited for the MCU’s Spidey’s continuing story.
I’m gonna be honest with you, no matter what people say TASM2 really isn’t that bad I enjoyed watching it
With great responsibility comes great territory 😂😅
Shut upppp
stop wathing on  Disney. Disney send money to isral
The Road to El Dorado is in his list I REPEAT THE ROAD TO EL DORADO IS IN HIS LIST
Hi, Dylan! Just to add fuel to the fire of your hatred towards disney lol, I encourage you to watch movies from other websites instead of disney as they are funding the genocide in Gaza. Please show your support to Palestinian by boycotting Disney :))
Dylan, please. Watch “Crazy, Stupid, Love” that’s right up your alley!!!
why did this make me realise that Amazing Spider-Man is similar to Morbius...
React to second movie, please
DYLAN!!!!!! When you're reacting to the second movie, PLEEEASE react to the deleted scene from the graveyard to!!!! It will change EVERYTHING!!!!! (Please spread this until Dylan sees this!! 🙏🏻)
Please watch a cross the spider verse too!!
OMG been waiting for these reaction video!!!!!
20:00
I felt my body drop when i saw the “leaving soon” on the amazing spider man
It's a reference to the lovebug.
Please do unicorn academy it would be so funny😂
Kurtis Conner collab when
HAHAHA this video got me laughing crazy, please do TASM 2 😂
WATCH ALVİN AND THE CHİPMUNKS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
SHE WAS BITTEN BY THE LOVE BUG!!!! Sorry for yelling Dylan you’re not really in trouble i love your work ❤
i love that he fell in love with gwen and peter's relationship eventually because they're arguably the best part of the movie
❤❤❤
I came to your channel specifically to look for a No Hard Feelings reaction... I watched it the other night and I REALLY REALLY want to know what your reaction would be
when you said that easy A joke and then acted out our reaction i was literally responding to your joke just like that and it felt hilarious how you knew HAHAH
andrew garfield was the best spiderman but clearly some of you aren't ready for that conversation yet
It was not better than tobey. The actors were trash and the story was already written.
You could say Dylan gave this movie...an easy A
She was bitten by the love bug
clinging to that easy A joke like a lifeline 😭
I was really hoping for Speaking of easy A's, today's sponsor audible
shocked about the title of this one... but, not everyone is perfect I guess, including Dylan </3
Now you got to kill the kid!!!
BY A LOVE BUG DYLAN FOR GOD SAKE
I think a big factor in why so many people love this movie (besides how awesome Andrew's Spiderman is) is that Gwen actually matters to the story from the beginning, as in she's not just the love interest and damsel in distress. She's just as stubborn as Peter is and she gets shit done. He tells her about him being Spiderman pretty fast and she immediately puts her skills to use in order to help him save the city. She makes her own choices when he tells her to stay away and chooses to risk her own life to save others. The story is obviously mainly about Peter, but she's a girlboss.
That's cute as hell
Another amazing movie commentary that almost made me bust a lung <3 I have to ask though: was the edited in "bubly" in the background this videos' sponsor or why was it there???
It's old but pls watch the birdcage robin williams 😊
I am so happy you are reacting to this. I love the amazing spider man. The commentary, love story, story, I love it s much. It's the best. Guy and the end that for you, for you, baby I'm not giving up. It's so happy and sad. And the couples they give
wait dylan homecoming is the best of the new one
i hope dylan reacts to amazing spiderman 2 now
Me, yelling at Dylan on my screen: The LOVE bug. She’s been BITTEN by THE LOVE BUG
”With great responsibility comes great territory” - Dyl
Andrew Garfield is the best spiderman. he totally nails the humor, the mannerisms, he's so good
Help I accidentally had this in two time speed when Dylan was talking about the sketch and it was so funny 😭😭
Next week do TASM 2 🥺🥺
Dylan wearing purple shorts with a green top….. so real 😂
Dylans fav spiderman movie being TASM is the best thing to ever exist
"With great responsibility comes great territory" wise words by Dylan 😢
28:38 Dylan…
this was great but BRO YOU COULD’VE WATCHED INTO/ACROSS THE SPIDER VERSE?!! come on!
She’s been bitten by the love bug Dylannnn😂
I am glad he put warmer lights on his face but because of the discrepancy with his neck, it seem like his head is photoshopped!!!!
after this video I'm going to watch Dylans commentary for easy A
My dude, u not getting what she meant when she said she was also bitten is some serious maidenless behavior
I think the play off of "bitten" was it sounds like "smitten"
HAHAHA "Easy A"
I think she meant love bug bit her 😂
6:54 omg i completely forgot irrfan khan was in this movie! (he was a legendary indian actor, who worked in indian cinema and few english movies as well. Passed away in 2020 at the age of 53)
I think she thought he meant he was bitten by a love bug lol
“With great responsibility comes great territory.” - Dylan
are those cans of Bubly on the table fake
great video but anyone else noticing how many ads there are on YouTube now??? i literally got 3 different ads in 12 minutes wtf
damnn dylan why you on trending 😭😭
do the second oneeeee,... so good its time to cry
If you don’t watch El Dorado, I will riot. You would LOVE it!!
Andrew Garfield is one of my favorite Spiderman actors. I'm so glad he's getting more love lately.  Just wish Amazing Spiderman 2 hadn't been as much of a train wreck.
i like this movie because its comfy. i dont know how to explain it but its comfy
Whenever people imagine Deadpool with spiderman, this is the spiderman I imagine. He’s sassy and not too childish or serious to handle Deadpool 😂
"I was bitten" "so was I" by the love bug. she meant that she was smitten with him and bit by the love bug
I'm very happy to know that I'm not the only one who appreciates Andrew Garfield's Spiderman
every time Dylan made an Easy A joke i heard Emma Stone saying "OOOO Burn"
Opinions are like Butts, everybody has one...
dylan mentioning kurtis connor is my roman empire
18:15 she meant she had been bitten by the love bug
i love this video
6:25 such a tiny Adam's apple. Got distracted lol
THE GASP WHEN I SAW MY FAVORITE TOW LONG STRING BEANS IN ONE PICTURE
By so have i, i think she meant like Ive been bitten too by the love bug lol. But I could be wrong of course 😅
It’s good but the best Spider-Man is Toby😛
Please react to the 2nd one omg 😭 your reactions literally my day
I really do like this movie, its my favorite SpiderMan + Love interest. Its probably why I was so emotional in No Way Home when Andrew Peter caught MJ. And he gets hope of a good future that the second one didnt end on. RIP Emma Gwen.
Andrew Garfield is by far my favorite spiderman. He's so dorky, and he's just head over heels for gwen. He's, in my opinion, the closest spiderman depiction to the comics. That knife line sells it, it's my favorite line from the movie lol
Would you recommend Unicorn Academy? I’m tempted to watch it.
As a girl with a spider tattoo I would like to make it known that Dylan's statement about us being into it if we found out someone was stalking us is, unfortunately, 100% true
Love that he just refused to let go of that Easy A joke. He really tried 🥲
It's nice to see how this movie holds up well, but better yet to watch Dylan have so much fun with it 😄
the soundtrack is epic because it's James Horner who made it!
honestly i would watch you watch unicorn academy, i couldn’t get past ep 1
You should watch strange magic it’s a Disney film (2015)
Andrew is the best Spider-Man. I prefer the Maguire movies but as playing as Spider-Man, Andrew did the best. Great suits, great Spider-Man banter, great acting, great chemistry with love internet. All round he was the most complete Spider-Man portrayal, just in a universe that rushed itself. Like if you look at no way home, people collectively agree that Andrew is a highlight and the favourite of the three (tobey nostalgia aside).
please watch the second one!!
andrew is the best spiderman !!!
Part 2 please watch the 2nd one
Dylan’s commentary is just pure dopamine 😘🤌🏻
Definitely not the best spider-man, Toby is the OG but i still like him 🤣
My worlds collided when Dylan joked about Kurtis Conner. This is absolutely not a recommendation. Kurtis conners new comedy special just dropped 👀
bitten by the love bug, dylan XD
I also have unicorn academy in my list, no judgement.
the easy A joke (at 29:54) really got me
PLEASE WATCH UNICORN ACADEMY DYLAN
love that you reacted to this movie
Dylan. She was bitten by the LOVE BUG. Come on.
18:19 The Love bug!!!! What else man
Nothing beats when Dylan actually enjoys the movie
“Did he shoot her booty” I’m cryin
the spider tattoo comment hella valid (i have a spider tattoo)
bro is getting closer and closer of posting on mondays lmao
I love this commentary so much I wish for them every time monday comes around. I hope he does the animated spider verse series soon he would absolutely love the cinematography
Dylan have you been working out? You’re looking well anyway 😊
When I watch movies I just accept things as they are and don’t question it. When his uncle died it was so sad but you were laughing about it 😨 Dylan always making jokes but I always watch his videos with a straight face, for some reason only my jokes work on me (when someone says a joke I don’t find it funny but when I say a joke I find it’s hilarious)
Boycott Disney – it supports genocide.
Alll i want to see is Unicorn Academy now
25:15
Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are seriously some of the top movie couple chemistry winners EVER. They literally just jump off of the screen and it feels so organic
Still waiting on an El Dorado reaction. Such an underrated classic, its probably my fav animated movie
"With great responsibility comes great territory" - Dylan , 2023
The knife bit is AMAZING
I had a tingle in my balls that Dylan posted...my balls were correct
the commentary i never knew i needed
Me coming from Kurtis Connor's Potterheads video to Dylan's commentary of the Harry Potter movies to this video where Dylan references Kurtis Connor....idk what it means, maybe YouTube just knows me too well, but it feels odd 😳
I feel this Spiderman and Dylan have similar senses of humor. Its fun to see him enjoy this movie and react to it!
BY A LOVE BUG DYLAN!!! SHE WAS BITTEN BY A LOVE BUG!!
It never fails to amaze me how Dylan always manages to upload every Monday!
Please watch the rest of How I Met Your Mother
the beef between Dylan and Disney over space bar continues.
He uploaded YAY
I've been bitten means like "bitten by the love bug" idk how common that phrase would have actually been during that time. But that's what Gwen meant when she said "so have i" saying she likes Peter.
Starting off insulting my fav movie but I knew the knife part would sell it
Hey Dylan! Please watch Talk To Me! You probably know but it was made by YouTubers and it’s so good! Seeing you enjoy a good horror movie would be a nice contrast to the suffering that you’ve done on this channel haha.
Please watch unicorn academy  😂 I watched it with a little girl and it would be so funny to watch you watch it
Apologies for asking Dylan but is there any place were we can recommend things to watch?
16:20 there’s a scene at the beginning when peter gets beat up by flash, and gwen reminds flash abt his tutoring or smthn. u could say smthn like “i bet its an easy a with her tutoring u” or smthn to that extent
Glad we agree on something. TASM is indeed the best spiderman ❤
Can U please react to The amazing Spiderman 2 pleaseeee
Is it bad that as soon as he switched to Disney+ I knew the spacebar joke was coming
i decided to watch the O.C. and i’m obsessed, thanks dylan
this video is near perfect
She was bitten by the lovebug, you can thank the Jonas Brothers for that one❤🪳
I love amazing Spider-Man and many people hate it I can understand with the directing choices in the 2nd one but my favourite
🤣🤣🤣 Dylan, where are you getting territory, my guy? With great power comes great responsibility... unless you're Dylan
my favorite spider man bro andrew is the best so glad you’ve watched this
Now you have to do the sequel
why did i think the chair humping was a bit about resurrecting the uncle
So like... we all agree Dylan's gotta watch TASM2, right? (For legal reasons, this is not a recommendation)
I desperately need to see jack the giant slayer commentary, this and the amazing Spider-Man have to be one of the best movies ever made
"hahah damn clumsy bitch" weird way to propose but okay
A man of culture
28:36 can creaking chair noises be the new chirping crickets?
there's two things Dylan has a beef with... his scam college and Disney's spacebar
In the scene, Emma Stone meant she’d been bitten by the “love bug”
We're getting closer and closer to Monday ;)
#9 on trending 😱 My favorite small YouTube channel isn't that small anymore. I'm happy for Dylan though. He deserves more recognition.
She was bit by a love bug!! Haha. “Shot by Cupid” would’ve been cool too. But he was bitten by a radioactive spider and she was “bit by a love bug” and falling for him.
Whenever Dylan has to watch a video on Disney+, you know it's gonna be a good day
First the Danny Gonzalez reference now KURTIS CONNER. I must saw Dylan you have excellent taste in YouTubers.
Gwen Stacy: “I’m a senior:” Dylan: “What is she, a junior?”
Idk what it is but this is quite possibly the best reaction from Dylan lol
I watched to many Ooga Booga Videos that I got confused when he called us "Troublemakers"... what am I? A boogie or a troublemaker. Identity crisiiis
joke about kurtis conner is hilarius
DYLAN please watch all Lion King, Lion King 1 1/2 & Lion King 2!!!!! nobody has reacted to all 3 parts, just the first one. please oh please
"Tonight's the night he finds the uncle-killer." kills me 😭🤣
Nice video
My favorite Spiderman and my favorite youtube man in one video 😃
Hands down my favourite Spiderman, I love Tom Holland but his version of Spiderman just gives me too much second-hand embarrassment and Toby kinda scares me with his wide-eye stare 💀
12:51  "Also he's wearing one of those dumb coats without sleeves" you mean a vest😂
Please watch StarWars
20:08 As a girl who likes spiders... I can't say he's wrong 〜⁠(⁠꒪▿꒪⁠)⁠〜
With great responsibility comes great teritorry! 😂
Who’s gonna tell him Gwen died
That Kurtis Conners joke!!!!!!Dylan!!!!
#6 on trending 👏🏼🎉
What would my mondays be without the weekly completely on schedule movie commentaries?!???!
Let’s dive in to unicorn academy tho I am kinda curious
Tobey: Best Peter Parker Andrew: Best Spider-Man Tom: Equally great at both  Andrew out of all 3 is the best ACTOR in general (imo) Tobey is great and Tom is awesome but Andrew Garfield is just an absolutely phenomenal actor that you can tell gives his all for this.
does dylan do live reactions to a whole movie or episode? CAUSE I NEED IT
wait now im confuse wasnt the guy who killed uncle ben the same guy in the small knife scene?
No because Andrew Garfield was robbed he’s truly the best I love him
17:53 “I’ve been bitten.” “So have I.” The Love Bug, Dylan. She’s [also] been bitten by the love bug. She’s assuming he’s admitting his feelings. Teenage Romance Tropes 101. 😂😅
i am very happy with this movie choice
this is too much fun Dylan you need to do the 2nd movie please please
Wait a minute i didnt know paul blart was on netflix.thanks dylan I'm gonna go watch that now
I like Dylan's videos, but this made me like the movie less. Lmao. This was hilarious though.
Andrew is absolutely the best spider-man, he physically moves like a spider which others did not do. He is so creative with his webs and swinging, and the suit is the best imo. The scene where he skateboards and uses his webs is my favorite scene in all of the spiderman movies. He's an amazing actor.
28:46 booooooooooo 😂
I love how much fun Dylan’s having in this video! So entertaining!
My favourite spider man 😌
I started to watch unicorn academy too😂
14:49 😂😂😂😂😂 I’m crying hahahahahahaha
no
not me thinking "he is a cop so he must die for the canon" ... spiderman into the spiderverse really has me on chokehold
Okay, now do the second one pls lmao
Bit by the love bug!
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”  “But those are the best kind.”  Dylan: See you guys next Monday!
#4 on trending is so slay
The Easy A jokes😂😂😂😂😂😂 love this commentary ❤😂
that Easy A joke killed me 😂  good job, Dylan
Oh I so love this movie and I am happy you enjoyed it too personally I love the 2nd one more but this one is amazing too
18:15 i think she meant bit by a love bug? 😂 idk love you videos :)
i was just watching this movie the other day no way we're telepathic
To be fair, the subway scene was probably just another regular day on a NY subway for them
these and the new animated spider man’s are the best
Now you gotta do amazing Spiderman 2 as well bro
oh i am so down for unicorn academy
Andrew's spider Man is just very very charming
When she says me too, she thinks he was talking about being bitte by a love bug. Well that’s how I took it
Eventhough I know it's not a perfect movie, this is still my favourite Spider-Man movie and I think it should be reagrded as one the best Spider-Man live action movies. I think it has a perfect cozy vibe to it along with it's Sci-Fi vibe wich I think fits Spider-Man's character and Peter Parker's scientific side very well. Besides, it features on of my favourite actors of our generation (Andrew Garfield) and lot more great actors that made me feel a lot more for these characters than their previous actors.  I think Peter's journey in this is very well written and his realisation of what Spider-Man should be is great character development and makes it feel earned. I love the fact that he becomes Spider-Man but it's only after the discussion with Captain Stacy that he realises that he is not doing the right things for the right reasons and that people like the police see him diferently. It's only after he saves a life that he truly becomes Spider-Man and realises his purpouse.  I love the actors for Uncle Ben and Aunt May a lot more in this one and I think they are great expressing emotions and making us feel for them.  Flash's character is the best version that we have gotten until today in any adaptation in my opinion. The only one that is just as good as this one is the version in the Spectacular Spider-Man show.  I like the fact that in this version Peter is still bullied nerd but it seems like he is just a very closed and outcasted kid, since the typical geek has not been a real thing and has been very exagerated in movies and other media to the point where its not even believable. I met people like this through highschool and sometimes I felt like I was this kind of person. Not bullied for being the way I am but just being a bit of an outcast because people didn't like the same things as me or because I found it hard to relate to people.  Gwen's character is one of the best as well and in my opinion the best love interest in any live action adaption by far. Emma Stone did a fantastic job and so did the people tha wrote her character and the people that made her look exactly like she did in the comics.  The CGI and action scenes are perfect. I really felt like I was watching a real human moving when watching Spidy move and not just a CGI dummy wich really gave the movie a grounded feel to it.   The soundtrack is probably my favourite soundtrack of any Spider-Man movie and gives me chills everytime peter swings to Oscorp. It's such a shame James Horner passed away so early, he was one of the greatest imo. May he rest in peace.  On the other side, I get why people criticize some of it. One of the weakest elements in this movie is the villain.  I like the casting for Doctor Connors and the Lizard would be a great starting point as a villain but his motivation were not great and not very well written in this movie. I feel like the movie could have used some of the deleted scenes like the one where he is with his son to explore him a bit more.  To end this already long comment I just wanted to say that this movie was realy underapreciated and that all the actors did a great job. Mark Webb was a great choice as a director and imo the best director in a Spider-Man movie when it comes to emotional scenes between characters. Although I like most of the second movie as well, I wish the studio did not interfere with his vision and let him explore the relationships and the drama within Peter's life more instead of cramming the sequel with everything they could. The potential was there, Sony just wasted it.
Let's watch unicorn academy
before watching this video of dylalalalannnn i will say frr this is def my fav becasue of andrew that fkr is so good at acting how?
I missed Joe’s editing on this video
For what it's worth Dylan, I appreciated the Easy-A / F joke a lot 😂😂😂  It was so funny lmaoo
DO THE NEXT ONE
i love this omg
the rage at the disney display is so real
4:21 Dylan giving his chair CPR  This moment made me laugh so much and I feel like it deserves more love so here you go  Okay I’m just going to make this a weird compilation of strange moments from the video: 6:25 lol  14:10  23:07 Dylan has been waiting for this moment his entire Disney subscription
"That guy is weird. I hope spider man kills him"  Did not age well Dylan lmao  The actor died 2 years ago
Don’t you just hate it when Dylan posts and we all time travel back to Monday? Like I don’t want to restart my week again
fun fact: phantom planet (the band that made California) had one of their songs in this movie during the scene where peter wakes up and attempts to brush his teeth
The soundtrack to this movie was so under appreciated, it’s so epic
16:34 aaaand she is in the movie “Easy A”
Actually I always thought this movie sucked and was one of the WORST movies with the character but uh... whatever. Maybe when you revisit the Raimi films, see the Spider-Verse movies and No Way Home, you'll see this is one of the weakest, by far.
She's been bitten by the love bug Dylan
Won me over w the title immediately
That Indian guy is Irrfan Khan, who was very popular in Indian cinema. He was a struggling actor for a long time, and then became one of the very few Bollywood actors to get many projects in Hollywood as well. Sadly he passed away a few years ago.
People claiming this is the best spiderman movie and not into the spiderverse is why I could never be a superhero
i thought he uploaded it on monday for a second and i was SO PROUD ... nvm tho
this is def my favorite. andrew has the PERFECT portrayal of Peter, and i love gwen so much. Him and Miles are def my favorites
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
The road to El Dorado is on his list..A man with good taste.
Not Dylan giving CPR to his chair
just here to tell you that the small knives line that you loved was improv by andrew 😎
bitten by the love bug, dylan!
Not me with my spider tattoo 👀
DYLAN KNOWS KURTIS CONNER?!!
Dylan you need to play Outlast!!
Next week's video better be the second movie, I WANT Dylan to experience Gwen's death as we all did EVEN THOUGH HE ALREADY KNOWS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
Dylan. When the bar isn't up, pressing the space bar brings it up and then you have to press it again to pause/play. If it is already up, just press once. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU 🤦‍♀️
The fact he enjoyed this film so much makes me think he’s not ready for how disastrous the sequel is
That's so funny I was just watching the first episode of Unicorn Academy with my niece. Honestly don't blame you mate
She was bitten by the love bug, Dylan.
andrew's peter parker is a dude you wanna be friends with, like i KNOW i would have a blast hanging out with him. my guy is smart, funny, witty, caring, athletic, he's pretty much got all the best qualities yet manages to stays humble. i like that these movies show his flaws and downs: the fact that he's stubborn and not the best at communication, the way he holds on to so much anger and sorrow and masks those emotions because he knows how other people (the entirety of nyc lol) depend on him. maybe i'm biased because i grew up with this spider-man, but tobey's just feels too mature (full grown adult) and tom's a bit too immature (an actual teenager, but it changed after the most recent movie). garfield's young-adult spidey hits just the right spot for me :)
Dylan, babe, we're boycotting Disney and their stupid control functions anyway
Complete the Emma Watson list. Watch lala land. (I know but I’m still gonna do it)
no wait I wanted Dylan to react to Gwen telling her dad off because Peter was in her room. " Dad I DO NOT WANT HOT CHOCOLATE, I'M A GROWN UP!!!" 😂😂
I want The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie commentary now this was too good love the jokes ❤😂
I haven’t even started watching the video yet but AMAZING take Dylan! This is my favorite spider-man movie to this date and I am so happy that you did a video on it :))))
That’s why I will love every remake of Spider-Man. Them discovering their abilities is every time is too funny
Dylan's vendetta against the space bar is still going I see lol
genuinely forgot irfan khan was in this movie
DYLAN CAN YOU PLEASE WATCH “ MONTE CARLO “
him saying Irfan Khan should be killed by Peter when he is actually dead in real life...
bitten by the love bug
I'm so glad he likes this movie! Especially 14:29! Best joke!! 18:26 best reaction🤣
16:32 Lol i thought the joke was gonna end with you being hard as stone because she's your tutor
18:00 Love Bug. Bitten by the love bug. It's a common saying for when you've fallen for someone. Her saying "so have I" just means that she thought he ment bitten by a love bug and she likes him too.
fr the best spiderman but part 2 is my faveee
iispiderman iispiderman tune churaya mere dil ka chain
DYLAN WATCH THE MILES MORALES MOVIES!!!!!
THIS IS #5 ON TRENDING
I think the spiderman quips and Andrew's delivery on them were my favorite parts of this era of spiderman, it's a shame he didn't get the trilogy treatment. I'm sooooo soooo glad that we got some redemption and closure seeing him get such an extended spotlight in no way home.
Dylan should watch repo! The genetic opera sometime 😍
Andrew Garfield is BY FAR the best Spider-man/Peter Parker. It's like they ripped him right off the pages of the original comics.   May not have been the "best" Spiderman movie, but it's definitely my favourite.
This just so happens to be the movie that started my love for both Andrew and Emma. It is a great movie but the second one had a much profound effect on me because of how it ended. I was so sure it was going to end well.
I can’t believe l’m going to watch unicorn academy after this I hate u Dylan
As a girl who likes spiders...why did you read me that well?
Yoo, I wasn't expecting Dyl to react to this one now 😂❤️
i’ll be honest i kinda wanted him to do into the spiderverse.
Bitten by a love bug Dyan. A love bug.
18:15 bitten by the love bug!
I wanna see the sequel with you guys here as well, next Monday maybe
Ah yes my favourite Spider-Man quote: “with great power comes great territory”
When Gwen says "so have I" to the "I've been bitten" remark by Peter , I think it's a  corny little comment like trying to say she has been bitten by the love bug, but I actually never caught on until now 😂😂😂better late than never ig
The someone’s been a bad lizard line is what I say to my leopard geckos every time before I feed them 😅 I love this movie
we, as a society, really did not need the amazing spider man movies.
im offended that the lights in the background arent red and blue.. you had one job dylan😔
Now imagine a multiverse that the roles are switched, SpiderMan is a youtuber reacting to Dylan's movie 🤪
can’t wait for unicorn academy 💅🏼🌺
7:00 not dylan calling Irrfan Khan weird. The Indians are coming for you dude.
I’m sooooo Happyy and giggly, thanksss for doing this movieee. I NEED a part 2 pleaseeee
„Man that man looks weird! I hope Spider-Man Ki-„ **AD**
My favourite spiderman 🥹
I don’t mean to recommend I’m just wondering if you are gonna do the the 2nd one?
Tobey as Spiderman is the best Forever
People who look like 25 y o andrew garfield don't get bullied in hs.
Okay but can we pls watch unicorn academy 😭✋
now next monday next amazing sipdey 2 plzz dylan
Now watch the second one.  And get absolutely destroyed.
To be fair nobody makes it out of the 2nd movie.
I don't think you need Disney to make you look stupid... Too much bla bla bla  2/10
"my weakness! small knives!" changed my life. i made it my phone's hotspot name and have never changed it since
I think Gwen meant that she was bitten by the love bug, meaning she is falling for him.
The Garf and Emma Stone are such good actors and they work so well together, and it makes these movies some of my favorites among the Spider-Men movies. When she dies, and Peter realizes they'll never have a life together, and then it comes back in No Way Home... man
Not really related to the video: I got an advert for a university during this video, imagine getting a university advert in a Dylan video
who said we don't want you to watch the unicorn academy? go ahead king give us what we both want
Not dylan saying i hope he kills him to irfans character when hes actually passed away irl 💀💀
Love the character development of Dylan learning to compromise and peacefully coexist with the Disney plus space bar functions
I think she might have meant bitten by the love bug??
See you next Monday! Loved this video definitely made me laugh
Dylan's beef with Disney's user interface, will never not be funny
Bro saying this one is the best Spider-Man movie when literlay Spider-Man into the spider verse exists
Dylan: what were they thinking? Me: it must have been the wind.
i really enjoyed this duology when it came out and i still think they're a lot of fun. had a blast rewatching with you Dylan, hope you want to do the second one too!
"Studiers" 😂😂😂
Did I laugh at the “Easy F” joke? Maybe.
This is my Fav Spiderman. Like Toby said in No way Home... he is Amazing. Cause its called the Amazing Spiderman lmao.
Did Dylan dye his hair red?
the man that threatens doctor and is the villain is actually a very famous talented late Indian actor who has been in different hollywood movies as well
PETITION FOR DYLAN TO BE THE LIVE ACTION SPOT
Me, with the spider tattoo 😧
Lol bitten by a LOVE BUG lmfaoooo
No one (not even the murderer):     Dylan: He killed his uncle but he also did give him free milk...   :D   Also I'm surprised you didn't crack a joke here about how college is a scam (21:34)
“With great responsibility comes great territory” 🤣
This is still my favorite Spider-Man movie to this day! I love this movie and I go back to watch it probably too much😂
Dylan, now you’ve gotta make a commentary on the second one! It’s so underrated but the best one ngl!!!!
Dylan im a minute into the video but i'm just letting you know that if you dont give us unicorn academy now i will be severely disappointed. my curiosity is beyond peaked
This was the first Spiderman movie I've ever watched and I loved it😂❤
Was watching Dylan watch the scene where Andrew saves the boy on the bridge and had such a visceral moment of nostalgia remembering the crane scene and how that scene changed my brain chemistry. That scene was my school laptop background in year 8 or 9 or whenever this movie came out. The way that Andrew was MY spiderman and my favourite spiderman and the hate his films received making them prematurely end the Amazing films unlike the Tobey movies... then came Tom, who is the most complete Spider-Man ushering a new wave of Spidey love and it opened the door for public sentiment to morph into "ok but Andrew!Spidey had rights" and then No Way Home everyone welcomed him back so warmly and even inspired demand for him to return to the suit, and ugh... this is just a film near and dear in a way only Spider-Man movies tend to be. Each Spider-Man iteration always hits different man, that even with superhero fatigue, I don't miss any of these films.
"with great responsibility comes great territory" sure dylan
I laughed a little too hard at the Sally Field being only one field joke 😂
#5 on trending omg, Dylans ego is about to take a big hit since this masterpiece is not number 1
I definitely love TASM 1 and 2 more than the other and think it's the best Spider-Man movies. Also the best soundtrack out of the Spider-Man movies.
17:58 she’s been bitten by the love bug (I’m sure she assumed he was gonna say that)
Such a good movie
My first thought when uncle Ben said Peter had a photo of her on his computer was " way to salt his game uncle ben". if anyone doesn't know what this references, it's The O.C
I would recommend Dylan and anyone watching this to start pirating all your shows and movies, we are boycotting Disney and Netflix and any companies that support israel, please if you care about Palestinian people in any way, don’t buy from these brands, free Palestine 🇵🇸
No the original Spider-Man is the best Spider-Man.....how dare you say the amazing Spiderman is anything....
23:15 YouTube better take notes
Omg yes! My favourite Spider-Man!! Dylan obviously has impeccable taste 🤌🏻
Based on
I like the Andrew Garfield one the best.
Usually my favorite type of commentaries from Dylan are from movies that I would never watch, because it’s fun to clown on things I don’t have a vested interest in.  But I really enjoyed this one, Dylan was happy watching it and it made me happy, even if I remember the shortcomings of the movie.  Great time all around
If I EVER develop video playing software I will make sure space bar starts and stops the video always. bc i wouldn'T want dylan whining about it for hours on end XD
I'm sure someone already commented on it, but at 18:17, I'm pretty sure Gwen means she was "bitten" by a lovebug.
the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone was lightning in a bottle. i'm not saying it carried this version of Spider-man, but it did *a lot*.
I’m so disappointed there was no segway into a sponsorship. Those are the best, you never know when they’re coming. But when they do they are smooth!
Biten by lovebug
i feel like Dylan has paused 3x more than he usually does in this video. He kept pausing all through Gwen and Peter's convo, he's so into it 😂
I literally never pause movies im watching 😂 ive never seen someone pause so much
not the product placement 😂😂
Ngl I'd watch unicorn academy with Dylan's commentary
ah yes, "great responsibility comes with great territory". a classic line
The beginning of this video is so chaotic
my life has just come full circle
PLEASE WATCH TASM 2
I just realized how the whole plot of him gooing after the killer is completely forgotten a quarter way thru the movie. dude dunked on his bully and was satisfied
This has to be the most beautiful boy on yT!!!!!
dylan you actually made this video for me specifically, thank you
So glad you liked the movie and I gotta be honest, loved the easy A joke and it's many variants attempts. You should definitely do a commentary monday with the other spiderman animation movie, I would be curious if you arer able to get your assumptions on the story right or completely wrong!
That one joke was freaking hilarious😂
He made this video for me
28:39 AH I GET IT EASY A WOW DYLAN I TOOK ME A BIT BUT WOW THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD
Dylan, I would LOVE to watch Unicorn Academy together
Andrew is what made that movie
Definitely watch “the amazing spiderman 2”
Gwen/Emma thinks Peter is saying 'I've been bitten' like, 'I've been bitten... by the lovebug'. That line really freaked you out though, so I am guessing that kind of phrase isn't something you're familiar with
Ayeee Dylan’s trending
I LOVE THE EASY-A JOKE DYLAN
I'm so glad he liked this movie. Andrew is my fave spiderman and these movies are so fun, Andrew and Emma carried. It doesn't matter than they're far from perfect movies. They're really fun anyway
At this moment, trending #5
omg my two shawties in one video, dylan and andrew garfield
I love your videos, you are so funny, but I don't know why I had  3 commercials in a row every couple of minutes! It made the video hard to watch, because I lost track so many times. Youtube, listen to me, I WILL NOT PAY YOUTUBE PREMIUM
Like this if you also want Paul blart. I saw the list and now it’s all I can think about
PLS WATCH THE SECOND ONE
14:28 YESSS AHAHHAHAHA I LOVE THIS MOMENT
Here are my reasons why TASM is my favorite: The Spider-Man suit is very detailed and unique, I really liked the story, The movie’s Oscorp tower and Spider-Man suit as well as other small things in other scenes had a correlation with hexagons which was a neet detail. I also loved the darker shading and lighting in many night scenes in the movie, and I loved the music in this movie especially the Young Peter theme that is used when he is building his suit and spider technology. Also though some may say it’s cringe, I loved the sort of shy awkward interactions between Peter and Gwen more than in the other Spider-Man movies. Also, compared to TASM2, TASM1 had some incredible details in the Oscorp lab using real equations, the super complex spider web machine in the Oscorp basement, Peter Parker’s nerdy messy room, and the simple clothing and hairstyle choice of Peter and Gwen in TASM, which becomes more fancy and complex as their characters develop in TASM2. Lastly, I loved the filming locations that were chosen for this movie. I was a kid when I saw this so the youth vibes hit very hard.
the kurtis conners joke was gold 💀💀
Dylan having Unicorn Academy in his watchlist is giving me life
Pleeeeeeeease watch the 2nd movie
PLEASEEE watch Unicorn Academy, it's so good I watched it in 2 days and I learned something valuable
disneyplus+ spacebar = dylan’s rage
omfg i didnt know irfan khan was in thisss 😭
OH MY GOD?? i just recently got back into my andrew garfield obsession and now dylan is reacting to my favorite movie omg
I used to have the same low quality issue with Netflix on Chrome. Switched to Edge and it works fine.
I gasped so loudly oh my god….. I know its a gold-written rule to never recommend you anything to watch but its 89 years of waiting and hoping you end up watching all of the spiderman films and doing commentary on them, and Anastasia. maybe this means the Anastasia commentary is coming soon 😮😮
Bitten by the love bug
when dylan said the butterfly effect comment i immediately was thrown into this nostalgic feeling when he was playing video games and played until dawn.
This was my brothers favorite movie for a while in middle school and his style now, at age 21, is literally just Andrew Garfield Peter Parker
Honestly, Dylan shouldn't feel too bad about that 'Kurtis Connor' Joke Cause I make the same stupid joke every time I watch this movie.  Dylan: Makes 'Curtis Conners' joke. Me right after: "That joke has already been made Dylan, be original."           Edit: Great Responsibility comes with great territory HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I peeped Road to El Dorado in the Netflix queue. Please tell me he is reviewing this next because it has everyone Dylan would love
dylan, please unsubscribe from disney+. it's important.
OMG OMG MY PRAYERS ANSWERED. aaa
PLZZZZ DO A COMMENTARY ON UNICORN ACADEMY
omg dylan I hope you know this vid is #5 on trending!!
🦄
I need Dylan's honest feedback on the "Just one," line.
Greatest threats to Spider-man: The Media Parents And the Disney+ user interface

i’ve been waiting for this one 😈
Dylan i freaking LOVE coming to your videos and having the best fun you ALWAYS make me laugh and point out the most random stuff and your always pointing out facts I never watched these two spiderman films so I'm glad I can see this one through you
This video is PEAK humor. PEAK HUMOR THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. I’ve been laughing throughout this whole video. I love this movie, I love this video. Amazing…. ;)
WHAT OMG IVE BEEN BLEEEESSED W THIS VIDEO
He's wrong. But I appreciate the commitment
Thank you for your service
Please do across the universe
Dylan not getting that Emma’s character thought that Andrews was referencing getting bitten by the love bug is strangely sweet  😂
watching this man watch movies brings me so much joy, i'm cackling at the interpretation of andrew garfield's hand gesture at 8:44
Bro I cannot explain the joy I get when Dylan enjoys something as much as I do
She was bitten by the LOVE BUG lollll
I KNEW DYLAN WOULD LOVE THIS SCENE 14:28
Dylan - thank you for helping thru my first heartbreak and for giving me so many so many laughs on my 21st bday!!!!
Dylan you ever heard of “getting bitten by the love bug”? Thats what gwen thought he meant so he agreed. Corny
my freeze frame while it loaded: 18:37 i’m dying 😭😭😭
This has been my fave spider-man movie since i was younger
It truly is the best spider man movie and I'm glad you understand
Great responsibility comes with great territory -Dylan 2023
dylan knowing that this is the best spider-man movie made my day
Calling Andrew Garfield, “The Garf” is unhinged💀
Aw yes, my favorite Spider-Man quote…”great responsibility comes with great territory” 😂
Was anyone else waiting for his transition to his video being sponsored by Bubly? Or did I miss it somehow?
HE CAN USE THE SPACEBAR FOR PAUSING!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Nah, cause I kinda want Dylan’s reaction to Unicorn Academy 😂😂 I’m grown as hell and I watched it
One of these movies they gotta give him an actual New York accent
Wow you covered my favourite movie and on my birthday?? Thank you for the birthday gift <3
"However, this guy did give Peter a free chocolate milk, so he's not like the worst person ever." 😂😂😂 I died when he said that!
4:28 that is a sentence that was just spoken out loud😅
Meat pack
dylan being able to upload a movie commentary EVERY. SINGLE. MONDAY. is so crazy to me 👏🏽
dylan's wearing a new shirt!
Let go Unicorn academy😂
you need to watch the second one now plzzzz
“With great responsibility comes with great territory” 😂
Bro I screamed when I saw this😆 I LOVE the amazing spider man
Holy shit the crane guy is George Foyet from Criminal Minds :O how did I miss that LOL
I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS PLEASE WATCH THE NEXT ONE THESE ARE MY FAVORITE
He was soo close to posting on monday
correct me if im wrong but i dont think shes his screensaver, uncle ben is just referring to when he came in and saw him working on that photo which was, yes, zoomed in on her… right?
Loved the kurtis conner joke
Youre the only YouTuber I dont watch to 'pass the time'. When you upload I make a whole event out of it. But when you watch my favorite movies like Spiderman and Moana.. oh you better know my whole day is going to be revolved around when I'm watching this and what food I'm eating to MAKE SURE I'm not interrupted!
Here's hoping you do No way Home soon!
Dylan you're the only valid person ever to have an opinion on this movie
my favorite part of this video is dylan finally figuring out how the disney spacebar UI works
Bud is mad annoying
NEW SHIRT?????
me reading this title and immediately yelling IT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i will always and forever be a tasm truther
12:30 is it dylans editing or is there a continuity error in the movie? Cus in first he steps threw the hole where peter broke the glass then it cuts and he just opens the door like he cant step thru it
This spiderman is definitely every 20 something teenage girl’s fav spiderman!
FUCK YEAHHHH this is the best spiderman
The second one is even better!
16:10 Dylan, you will have a chance to make that easy A joke on the second movie, be patient
FINALLY
Why don’t you take suggestions though..? Ngl a lot of the stuff you do is generic af. Or weird kids stuff 😅
I agree with you. He’s the best, Spider-Man, the best movie, the best actor, the best jokes.
Dylan obviously never listened to the iconic Jonas brothers song lovebug. “I’ve been bitten” “so have I” SHE MEANT BY THE LOVE BUG 😂
This was the most Dylan has enjoyed a movie in so long
Unicorn
I love this movie
yes yes yes you uploaded
That “easy F” joke was top class Dylan, don’t be embarrassed.
it's the bubly placement for me
Spoilers for second movie below(just in case)     I’m actually so upset they didn’t finish the trilogy bc seeing a version of Spider-Man that doesn’t pull his punches or kind of a darker side to Peter would be so cool to see on screen.
“Id rather have a nub” - Dylan quotes of 2023
everytime dylan questioned why they just ignored peter doing spidery things i was like dude theyre new yorkers they eat cockroaches for breakfast and sleep with rats
22:57 it’s a very Peter thing to talk shit and get his ass beat anyway
personally would love a unicorn academy video Dylan. how dare you say we don't want that.
haven’t watched any of the video but the title says it all,, best movie commentary monday
BEST SPIDERMAN!!
19:54 “with great responsibility comes great territory” yeah sure dylan 😭
One of my favourite movies of all time + dylan = perfection
I know he was joking about the spider girl thing but I was low key offended XD
my boy if you dont watch Spirit: the stallion of cimmaron next, ill sue
Why does a week feel so loooong
Yesssss
i wanna upside down kiss toby maguire like in the movie
You should watch the second one too, even in your own time but i would love to see ur reactions to the amazing spiderman 2 😊
Ayyyy I'm getting a video on my birthday!!  Also Andrew is my favorite Spiderman ❤
"That man is weird, I hope Spider-man kills him"   That man's already dead Dylan, Cancer. Life of Pi, Jurassic World  One of the greatest Bollywood actors   How do you feel now Dylan, how do you feel now ?
i actually gasped when i saw this, andrew garfield spiderman movies will always be my favorite and the best IMO (exept miles)
Nothing makes me want to punch someone in the face more then if they say “that looks too cgi” when they’re literally looking at a practical shot. Like holy shit it’s not rocket science
I hated spiderman across the spider verse the ending was not satisfying at all
I think Gwen meant bitten by the love bug.
I guarantee Dylan will like the amazing spider man 2
Anyone else wonder about the rando high pitched voices?
i can see why so many people like this movie but its just too melodramatic for me too many tragedies in a short time and it just feels heavy i liked the tom holland's movies bc it used to be silly and more wholesome but after no way home this also vanished and i guess the problem is the characther background after all ITS JUST TOO SAD
Dylan knows his female audience very well because Garfield Spiderman movies are very popular for female audiences.
Yea people’s reactions wouldn’t be like this cause irl they’d be so quick to pull their phone out before moving on lmaoo
this is my favourite spiderman because of andrews comedic timing but mainly because of petergwen their chemistry is off the charts and their story is so cute since she’s his equal constantly helping him be better as peter AND spiderman something which the other movies lack imo
AHHH I’M SO EARLY. LOVE YOU DYLAN 🤍🤍🤍🤍
pls do hunger games
haha I'm glad you get the hype! this movie is so good because it has the comedic moments without being too contrived like mcu movies nowadays, and the emotion really hits you, and the tension in the plot is done really well and great chemistry between emma and andrew you can tell why they dated in real life. it's a movie I will rewatch many many times without ever getting sick of it
me, a girl with a pet spider:
Unicorn Academy is the only thing I need em y?.. Can you just watch it.
I think she meant a love bite lmaoo it’s corny but somewhat cute, their rooftop scene is my fav
PLEASE WATCH THE SECOND AMAZING SPIDERMAN, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY ON THAT ONE IS SO GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE SLOW MOS!!!
You gotta do the second movie plssss
I got scared that Dylan posted on a Monday, then i remembered my internal clock is messed up. 😜
Disappointed ☹️ I wanted him to watch Spiderverse.
God, this movie is so bad. The only thing worse is the sequel, which you should definitely cover!
Bitten by the love bug Dylan. The love bug.
Tobey best
It’s the Lovebug Dylan. She was bitten by the Lovebug.
The joke about the lizard guy’s computer was too good
Free milk to the kids sounds like all types of wrong, I’d still hunt him down 😂
Hey it's tuesday!!🎉 congratulations you almost got it right 👏
Yes to Unicorn Academy 🦄
Okay, the title on its own gets an automatic like from me because seriously- ASM is the best. I have vouched for this movie so many times I have a list of points almost ready to go off the top of my head at this point. Yes I'm about to go on a rant but I cannot NOT scream into oblivion about how much I love this movie.  1, I get that Tobey-Spidey is classic, sure, but it's super dated and, although I still enjoy it, also a little cringey. I mean seriously, "pizza time" and "dig on this" haunt my nightmares, and that's just two examples. 2, The new Spider-man (really Spider-Boy, in my eyes lmao) never connected with me because it feels targeted for a much younger audience, even though I'm in my early 20's. I also never liked the fact that that Spidey had the whole avengers team on his side, when his whole journey is dealing with loneliness, loss, social struggles, and taking on too much by himself. Marvel also just generally gets on my nerves, tbh. Super repetitive plot dynamics and shallow characters, whose only interesting qualities tend to seem written more for shock-value. 3, Gwen Stacey is just the BEST. I mean come ON people. Tobey's MJ was just a damsel in distress tbh, and the recent MJ is a little too much of a stereotypical grumpy-but-secretly-not-so-grumpy tom-boy love interest, yknow? Like she made Tom's Peter fit way to perfectly into that trope of "nice guys get the girl". And I know, we all love us some Zendaya, but that is clearly not her BEST role over other things she's been in, and they did not do her or her character much justice with the writing, either. 4, The Flash Thompson in this is sooooo well written and actually has personality, a beautiful, emotionally-engaging, and interesting background/character arc, and story-relevant connections to Peter AND Gwen. The first Flash had zero depth and the recent one is genuinely annoying, like I'd enjoy the movie more if he wasn't there, which isn't how antagonists are supposed to work. You're supposed to value what they bring to the plot, while still rooting for them to lose. I was rooting for his head to end up in a trash compactor as soon as possible. They are not the same. 5, The villain(s) in ASM oh my god! Rhino is mid but at least if you do research his actual character background is cool (Russian immigrant just helping his family through villainy type shit lol). But Connors???? Don't even get me started! He is just so integral to Peter's story and vice versa; they are so deeply connected and it hurts to see them fight, but in a hurts-so-good way, writing-wise. 6, Peter's parents' deaths actually are shown in a really well-crafted and simple-yet-interesting-and-complex way in this movie. Love it. 7, This Uncle Ben and Aunt May are both my FAVORITES by a mile. We didn't connect emotionally to any of the other ones, albeit Tobey's Uncle Ben did have some wise words. But I wasn't like emotionally invested. I couldn't tell you his personality or goals other than "be Uncle Ben, raise nephew, say old man shit" lmao. With ASM Ben and May, there's like DEEP character development and personality going on. I LOVE them; that's the difference. And I don't even have much to say about the recent Aunt May she's so boring I don't care about her and I find her very cringey and underdeveloped as a character, tbh. 8, Dude the humor lowkey kinda sucks in the other movies but in this I genuinely love the quippiness and even the little bit of edge thrown in. Like being a superhero is dark asf! Of course he's coping with humor, lmao. And he's a NERD. So of course it should be like hella good humor, not just Marvel-ass, "he's right behind me isn't he" type shit. Tobey's is a runner up here, but once again, a little dated by comparison. 9,  Andrew Garfield does a MASTERFUL job (per usual), and the writers too, at portraying the pain and deeply emotional, traumatizing, extremely, uh, *unique* experiences Peter was going through, with the most realistic reactions and personality put into it, very accurately for such a famously quippy-but-also-traumatized hero like Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Plus he just slays at everything. He's got acting CHOPS, like he's done everything from stage acting (Angels in America) to dystopian Sci-Fi/romance (Never Let Me Go) to super heroes (duh) to biographical Broadway musical-movies (Tick-Tick-Boom). He's also just a wise, deeply mature individual, and I admire him in general so much. 10, I am not biased by nostalgia- I promise- because I didn't watch any of these until I was in early high school and actually looking more into quality writing/movies, and all around the same time, so I experienced them all with relatively similar perspective.  Basically, I am seriously shocked this is the one that people often rank as their #3, because I see no flaws where the other movies did have many flaws, AND some amazing (haha) qualities the others never even touched upon. This movie is a good stand alone movie, AND a good superhero movie, AND a good coming-of-age story. Everybody who disagrees shut up (but also be nice to me please lmao).
Dylan predicting the entire plot before the movie even starts will never not be impressive,   also its the love bug, she means she was bitten by the love bug at 17:42
Alright movie boy where is the Star Wars at I’ve been waiting for years
I agree with the era defined reason..everyone got so loud in theaters during his appearance in no way home lol, whereas I got excited over Tobey, Willem and Doc Oc 😂 but everyone else were probably babies or never born yet when those came out so can’t blame em lmao
Dylan I am begging you to make a beer and a movie about all 3 Tobey Maguire Spiderman installments
I just love the kurtis Connor reference
Yea..this Peter is just creepy Lmao, like we all know Gwen’s cute but even dudes in relationships don’t have their gfs as their savers😂 (the only two of my bfs have, ya’ll stay safe lmao) but at least Tobey and Tom were awks in a cute way and their stories with MJ were slowly developed. I honestly never really liked the idea of Gwen and Peter so probably another reason I never bothered watching these movies (ngl tho, the cutest scene between them tho is def the Spidey web kiss scene lol slightly cliche but cute)
you shoulda put “the best spider-man” in the title. js.
"With great responsibility comes great territory"
My FAVORITE spider man movie❤❤😍
Tobey’s is the best.
The Indian man in the movie is Irfan Khan. He was one of the best actors from Indian cinema. He passed away in 2020 and literally everyone in the country still mourns his loss. Just wanted to let everyone know because he deserves to be known.
not one pun abt the directors name being james webb wilddd
Yea I remember these movies coming out when I was 13 but I had already grown out of the Spider-Man phase and it didn’t look as interesting but it’s not bad. Andrew and Emma are super talented and having grown up with Tobey’s version I never watched these till recently but wow is this the most depressing 😅 probably more so than Tom holland’s lol yes I said it
Andrews films were better than people like to admit, he killed it as SpiderMan but they were just so attached to Tobey no one wanted to admit it. He got jipped out of a third movie because he openly stated it wouldn't be against comic lore if he explored his sexuality after Gwen and wouldn't walk the statement back. He (and the villain from his second movie) was one of the best parts of No Way Home tbh and renewed people's interest in seeing more from him.
fantabulous commentary, hopefully the second one is just as enjoyable
Great video, but where's the couch??
this is a new all time favorite video :)  hopefully  you do the second one too  cant wait <3
This is one of my favourite movies and has always been my favourite spiderman and watching Dylan experience it was so much fun. I had a rough day today but this made it so much better
Wow, Dylan watching a movie that doesn't make him hate himself? What a novel experience.
I've actually never seen this set of movies either, despite knowing a lot about it. This was a really fun watch!
dylan does not understand the absolute ridiculousness of the goings-on in the NYC subway bc a person being on the ceiling would indeed elicit a minimal reaction from any new yorker.
I feel like dylan had some unhinged energy in this video and it’s great Xd
Not me having a crappy Monday and then being surprised by my favorite pasty 20 year old
Idk how to rank my faves, Spidey guys, lol. Andrew is my fave live action, but overall, I'd say he's my 3rd fave behind Miles and Noir
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE SEQUEL OF THIS MOVIE!!
My two favorite malnourished tall yt men sharing a screen☺
Marvel era
Gotta admit, I haven't watched you in awhile ever since your music video and album reactions, but I had to watch this just cuz u were reacting to my fav spiderman  movie. And, i had lots of fun doing so!
I love Andrew’s spider man.  For me, Tobey was just to old and Tom is to youthful. Andrew is that sweet spot for me.  Though each Spider-Man brings something new to the screen and universe. Andrew’s just felt the most genuine and relatable. It’s fun and sad in all the right ways.
Gwen: “Hi, I’m a senior… Dylan: “What is she a junior?!” 😂😂😂😂
Happy Monday 💕
i've been going through such a rough time. I just finished two projects that i've been working on for too long. i open up youtube and see this and i am so happy. thank you dylan. i love these movies idc
it's funny since it's still the worst Spiderman out of all lol. sorry but look at the material
You are right. This is the best Spider-Man movie.
Would like to point out Gwen has a conversation with Flash about tutoring him early in the movie and you could easily have fit the joke in there.
“I’ll see you here next Monday.” 😂😂😂 oKAy…
I expect the reaction to the sequel next lmao 🤣
Complete cringetwink like you will say EVERYTHING is the best if there's money involved
Easy F worked
It’s okay Dylan, I started Unicorn Academy the day it came out. XD
OK NOW DO. THE. SECOND. ONE.
Dad's thumbs up, bud 👍🏻
Leave it to Dylan to entice us to watch, using JUST the title😏
I really wish you could do a commentary video about Behind Her Eyes!!! I have few reactions of your face in my mind  ITS WORTH THE WATCH ISTG
I just assume the people on the Subway didn't care because it's New York. That's quite possibly not the strangest thing they've seen in the last half hour 😂.
The small knife line was actually improvised by Andrew
I thought it was general consensus that Toby is the best Peter Parker, Andrew is the best spiderman, and  Tom is a nice balance between
"The great responsibility comes with great, uh, territory"😂
New troublemaker here! So excited for my first video on the day of the upload! Thanks Dylan!
i watched all the spiderman movies this past week and there’s just something about andrew garfield’s spiderman. he was the highlight of spiderman no way home imo
this and homecoming are my two fave spiderman films - and probably my two favourite superhero films overall. I love the whole 80s film aesthetic of homecoming as well as the relatable teen quirkiness. and I love this one cos it more feels like a indie teen romcom and one of them happens to be a super hero rather than a 'superhero film' if that makes sense.
i vibrated with excitement seeing this pop up
this video basically Dylan complaining Disney space function. hhahahaa
nice new shirt, Dylan!
Andrew garfield will always be my #1 spider-man🙏🏽
"with great responsibility comes great territory" is my new favorite quote from the movie
Did I just watch you give CPR to chair?
when dylan watches a good movie>>>
Loving the mustache
i do think the space bar gets stuck on the full screen option once you click the bottom right full screen button. try using the F key (the letter F, not a function key) for full screen and the escape button instead and the space bar should only pause. love your videos!
Damn can't believe dylan finally approves of a movie. So rare😢 imma cry
I was waiting for the knife weakness scene cause I just knew Dylan would love that shit
the "easy f week" got me, it was hilarious
shes been biten by the LOVE BUG hahaha 18:14
DYLAN SHE WAS BITTEN BY THE LOVEBUG
my favorite spiderman. i think the second is my favorite, but the way andrew plays peter in both movies is so comicy and charming.❤
the best movie ever and forever and forever and more
andrew qill always be my fav
WE WANT UNICORN ACADEMY [
this and the Toby Maguire one is the only spiderman movie I've watched lol
the product placement 💯💯💯 reverse psychology making me focus on it MORE
this is the only spiderman move that I don't remember, it was not me cup of tea 😅
Hahah my daughter watched unicorn academy and I ended up getting into it more than she did 😅
Bitten…smitten
Dylan's fixation on the reaction of the people on the subway is how I just know he's never experienced New York.
the easy A jokes are killing me lol
‚how are these people so blasé about his powers‘ its New York dude, we don’t give a shit.
I saw road to eldorado in your list and got excited!
21:01 "What are this people thinking in there head?" Answer: "Wow, that girl there is really strong... 😮" *while ignoring the dude*
SPONSORED BY BUBLY?? They have those in major supermarkets where I live, hopefully Dylan got paid a lot for this sponsorship
Omggg yes
Unicorn academy season 1 reaction.
😜
What? No recap or final thoughts at the end??? 😢
Dylan getting all excited that the Disney pause button is working correctly and 1 minute later it stops working and he just looses his sh*t about it for the rest of the video is hilarious 😂❤ love your videos Dylan!!!
Dylan please watch the first and last episode of Chucky the series plsss❤❤❤❤❤
I’m so glad Dylan has the correct opinion on the best Spider-Man movie
If you loved this please react to Spiderman no way home, because Peter 1,2, and 3 were way too perfect together
Bitten is an old school euphemism that's just missing the second part. Bitten by the love bug is probably what she was going for in that line. It's cheesy, but makes sense.
Ameeeee este videoo aww
You gotta watch the first movie if you watch “across the spider verse” movie which is “into the spider verse”
Kurtis is here?
why is nobody talking abt the fact that he’s watching unicorn academy
Day 4 of trying to ask Dylan out . Can I take you on a date Dylan
Watch mid 90s
THIS IS THE BEST ONE
Petition for Dylan to watch TASM 2 and react to the clock tower scene!!
1:12 I wanna watch you watch the unicorn academy!
this was exactly what i needed from you god bless
andrew garfield is such a great actor. I'm not even a musical fan at all, but I loved tick tick boom
I love this film!
Watch the rest of them!!!!!
Yesssss! Original fan from release! Best Spider-Man for sure 🥰
Petition for him to do 365 days
Has Dylan never heard of being bitten by the love bug, or is this just another one of those "Dylan moments"?
bitten by the lovebug Dylan LMFAO, I literally can't stop laughing
Wait but like actually react to Spider-Man across the verse tho
Please react to the sequel
Dylan please watch unicorn academy 😭🙏 1:13
She meant by the love bug, Dylan. She was bit by the love bug!!!
please please please watch the second one!!!
I have never heard anyone say this was their favorite spiderman movie
Dylan coming back to the Easy A joke four separate times shows his commitment to his craft.
seeing unicorn academy on his netflix made me think how dylan could literally have a wife and kids and none of us would know about it. he's like a kpop idol with how under wraps he is as a person
I literally just re-watched the amazing spider-man recently. I'm stoked to see Dylans commentary lol
I just watched this movie right now for the first time, and this one made me like Spider man, I kinda didn't cared abt Spiderman before this movie.....damn
AHHH I loved this! Please do the Amazing Spider-Man 2, I think that the 2nd one was the most hated out of the two.
She’s been bitten by the love bug Dylan..
cant wait for part2 kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
ive been waiting my entire life for this video and it didn't disappoint!!!! i loved how he appreciated gwen and peter's relationship :(
Unironically the best spider-man movie.
sending love to dylan for making these! seriously he got me through high school.
18:16 by the love bug!!
If I were to give this commentary a score, it would be an easy A from me
“You just watched a guy jump to the ceiling and hang there” - Dylan, I’ve seen people do more crazy stuff on the subway. Trust me, seeing a guy doing that is not impressive.
Bitten by the lovebug, Dylan. XD
This is about to be the best video he's ever made
Dylan...hear me out. When you are in Disney+ on full screen, hit "tab" to lock it. Then, when you hit the space bar, it won't exit out. Troublemakers help me out so this man doesn't continue to face this issue.    Of course I have only tried this on a mac✌🏼
“With great responsibility comes great territory” took me out lmao
just watched across the spider-verse and this is literally the perfect video to smoke to before i go to bed
You have to see the second one too
Andrew is the best Spider-Man
andrew garfield is the best spider-man. fight with the wall.
bitten by the love bug Dylan, obviously.
it would have been funny
22:52-22:54 can’t wait for Dylan to watch the second movie
okay dylan now u have to watch the second one like u dont have a choice
When Gwen Stacy said she got bit too she meant by the love bug .
I think Dylan talks to his therapist about the space bar and Disney+
clicked the like button the minute he clicked full screen followed by the space bar lol
dylan this was incredible, i laughed so hard i had to watch it again.
“it’s like asking a horse to baby sit your dog”
BOY YOU BETTER WATCH ROAD TO EL DORADO!!!
Now I'll have to wait another ten years for Dylan to watch the other Spiderman movie... it's actually as funny or even funnier than this one. Okay... No, this one's funnier.
Andrew's Spider-Man will always be the most accurate Spider-Man for me.
At least you were closer to a Monday upload this time Dylan 😂
Dylan liking the movie so much just warms my heart. It was my comfort movie growing up.🫶
Dylan I am so happy you watched this, absolutely made my day. Please do a vid on TASM 2, it'll be another banger I know ❤
I hate spiders with everything in me, but I have a spider tattoo 😭 it was something I did because of my fear and I find that it diminished my fear of them lol I swear there has to be a study on the science of this 🤔
Plssss lest watch unicorn academy
MEGAMIND, please watch megamind, you will love it!!! You dont need to film it but you will love it.
Never forget: With great responsibility comes great territory.
The best? the gaslighting started thinking it’s Monday and ended with the title 😂😂
we need dylan’s letterboxd asap
YES- Andrew’s Spider-Man is SUPERIOR.
Such a terrible movie XD
Uncle Ben: dies* Dylan: A small price to pay for chocolate milk
thats no evil man and that aint uncle ben. That's Josiah friggin Bartlet!!
How funny is to hear the crack of Dylan's voice 21:09
It feels like Dylan gets closer to Monday with each post but never quite made it
Please do Unicorn Academy!!! Not a recommendation
That bit about girls who like spiders loving to be stalked sure was r/oddlyspecific.  I feel like there's a deeper story not being told here 😂
the spider thing sent me it was so out of left field like the generalization that every girl ever with a spider tattoo gets off to stalkers is hilarious
I still think Andrew Garfield is the best casting for Spider-Man/Peter Parker however he’s not the best I think Tom is better just because he’s more well rounded and that come from the movie’s writing I don’t think this is a great Spider-Man movie as Spider-Man should never be motivated by revenge Toby’s version does go on a quick rampage to catch his uncle’s supposed murderer however as soon as he’s wearing the proper Spider-Man suit he is all about stopping crime as it’s his responsibility Andrew Garfield is just a criminal hunting down a murderer However I do find enjoyment in this film purely for Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone I think they’re so much better than Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst I prefer Spider-Man 1 and 2 as movies but I don’t like a lot of the performances or character motivations mainly between Peter, MJ and Harry
Dylan it's a love bug  similar to the cupid reference.😁
Gwen meant she was bitten by the love bug
Yesssss, I love seeing people putting respect to Andrew’s version of Spider-Man. I remember going immediately to theaters to watch it and the second one and him becoming my instant favorite iteration of the webhead. It always makes me so happy to see people finally showing Garfield love.
8:20 my dad used to do this when I was a kid. He'd pretend to eat the fly he caught, but in fact he'd let it slip down to the floor. Mini me did not understand that and would cry/be grossed out thinking he really ate it😂
Is that a new shirt?
THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME IM SO HAPPY DYLAN IS REACTING TO IT AND LIKES IT ON TOP OF THAT😭😭😭
I havent watched the vidoe yet and i agree
Bitten.... by a love bug
Biggest character development was Dylan finally figuring out how Disney uses the space bar
Always will be my fav spider man. I just like the type of Peter Parker Andrew Garfield portrays compared to Toby or Tom's. Andrew really shows off his acting skills in this movie
That easy A joke was smart
These movies mean so much too man and glad they’re finally being appreciated in some form.
Now, this is a title to improve my day
dylan never dissapoints
Bitten by the love bug!!!
Andrew and Dylan? My boyyyys
assiste o 2 duvido
How many on running jokes do we think we will get about Dylan's chair before he finally replaces it in 5 years?
28:47 I she would see this weak as cruela
THE SCREAM I SCRUM SEEING THE TITLE
Dylan, pls get to daddy Miguel in the future
Accualy favorite Spiderman 1 movie. Aldo the second one is ass xD
no joke i get so happy when i see that dylan posted
16:25 cue pitty laugh,  28:41 cue real laugh! The joke started corny, and ended strong!
wow a new shirt !!!!!!!!!
Once bitten and twice shy
I'm so glad you liked this movie, its one of my favourite spider mans, it's so funny and good
Finally, someone who agrees with me. Almost everyone I've talked with is like: "The originals are the best." And: "Tom is so handsome and funny." So Andrew has always slipped through the cracks. But he has always been my favourite. And i feel he's unappreciated. I don't agree that often with Dylan, but I'm really happy with his reaction today. 😄
The Kurtis Conner joke KILLED ME as a member of kurtistown
IM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW I LOVE TJIS MOVIE THIS JUST MADE MY DAY SO MUCH BETTER
16:18 Dylan completely forgetting that Gwen talked about tutoring Flash in the beginning and had the opportunity to make the joke is so funny
Stop trying to make Easy A jokes happen Dylan, it's not gonna happen
Ooo this Will be good. Such a nice surprise after a long and tier movie shoot
So I’m writing a book…unlike someone *cough cough* but if I wanted feed back would you be able to do that Dylan?
Andrew Garfield 🔛🔝
I was waiting for you for two days felt like forever I had literally nothing else to watch thank god 😌
18:14 never heard of the love bug
the second one is ever better!
I never knew I will see the time where he watches amazing spider man but here we are so happy
also may i say i wish Dylan would do any interviews or be on podcasts or sit down and talk videos like i know he just exist in social media with his comedy videos and we do get to see some of his personality but i wish i knew more of him in serious conversation he seems like such a cool dude and I wish we got to see more beside his funny and jokes side
Andrew Garfield is my favorite spiderman! He’s the best actor and he’s so funny! I just wish his villains were better
I need your reaction to The Other Zoey or I’ll sue🔪
i neeeeed me a Dylan and sturniolo triplets crossover i just know their humor would go together so well specially him and nick
OH MY GOD YT CROSSOVER OF MY DREAMS HE MENTIONED KURTIS CONNER
18:16 she meant she’s been bitten by the live bug
I am super down to watch a commentary on unicorn academy btw
That Kurtis Conner reference was fantastic 😂
Dylan this is still my favorite comfort movie and 2012 Andrew Garfield is still everything to me so if you have a PROBLEM it's going to be ON
I liked that one joke. Anyways how's the book?
we almost had it all
WE WANT UNICORN ACADEMY!!!!!
i never been happier seeing that u watched this movie
I love that I watched this for the first time 2 days ago and realized that it is my favorite Spiderman movie, THEN to have Dylan upload my exact thoughts 2 days later! Today is a great day:)
spiderverse
Peter Parker is actually one of the most intelligent Marvel character.
I’ve always loved Andrew’s Spider-Man. His acting in this is so phenomenal and tearful at times.
The truth is there is no such thing as a bad Spiderman! The concept is brilliant and untouchable! It's emotional, action filled and funny.  I think it addresses an emotional side of men that is ignored too much! He's growing and learning how to really be a man, not just a celebrity! I love it because we all can relate to growing up!
Andrew will always be the BEST Spiderman
dylan needs to make merch that says “no wait this is a MISDIRECT”
You should definitely watch the second one too! It’s amazing!
The best part of this video is the “ooo did he shoot her booty”
This was such a great video Dylan, especially that one joke 😄 it was so funny!
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard to one of your videos before omg. oh and I know you hate when we don't say what is funny so I'll give you some timestamps: 2:22 ("studiers"), 2:30 (uncle ben is evil lol), 4:21 (chair), 8:19 (the fly thing), 14:28 (knife vs Spiderman), 16:20 (easy A), 20:08 (girls who like spiders), 22:52 (out of webbing?), 23:56 (Gwen survives?), 25:35 (dad of saved child), 28:18 (New York streets are dangerous, 29:42 (easy F week)
8:09 this is New York lol
I think Andrew Garfield is the best “Spider-Man.” I feel that while great actors and Spider-Men in their own way both Toby and Tom seem to miss that “friendly neighborhood” part.
I wasn’t born yet when Tobeys came out. My introduction to the world of superheroes was this movie, and now I’m making my own superhero comic. This movie was the start of it all and will always hold a special place in my heart
love bug is what she has been bitten by
Unicorn Academy may be on your watchlist but CentaurWorld is where it’s at
Why do I have this strange feeling I'm not going to see Dylan next Monday.
Watch Loki plsssss
Am I dreaming? Did he really react to and like this movie? I never thought I’d be sitting down one Monday to watch him watch TASM!
Dylan knows Kurtis... this makes me so happy, my two favourite youtubers
Damn dylan you are looking too good recently
I love you for posting every time I have such a hard day.
Bro I'm so tired of this week and Everytime Dylan posts, he just alleviates my pain. Angel sent from Heaven. 🥹🤝
THE KURTIS CONNER REFERENCE
The news show is soo dope! I'm not gonna recommend it! I love the theme music sooo much it hard core slays, But you wouldn't like it so I"M NOT RECOMMENDING IT!
i need kurtis conner to leave a comment
i literally read the title and screamed
DYLAN PLS WATCH SPIDERVERSEE
Still waiting for the day that dylan finds out the space bar repeats the last click so if you click full screen and then play it‘s all good
My Fav YouTuber Of All Time
why is their front door glass...
I'm gonna be real with you Dylan, I was Concerned™ when I saw this on my homepage, because this is one of my favourite movies ever and I know how you get 😂 But this was a great reaction and I'm glad you didn't rip it to shreds too much ahahaha
so glad that dylan has finally seen my favorite harry potter movie
I’ll never forget loving these films while most people trashed on them when they came out but it’s lovely to see the appreciation now
She was bitten buy the love bug
Watch Unicorn Academy, you coward.
I cannot believe you cut the "Easy, bug boy" scene
Him delivering the joke he wanted to put in is funnier than the joke 😂
Please watch unicorn academy
Unicorn Academy would be entertaining but what I’m really waiting for is the Road to El Dorado, oooh the innuendos in that one are off the charts 😉
dylan referencing kurtis conner collided my worlds in such a great way
Me patiently waiting for Unicorn Academy 👀👀👀
I loved this movies so much
Spider-Man: No Way Home is the best!!! Please react 🙏
Love bug bite was the meaning 😆
dylan never having heard of the phrase being bitten by the love bug.
just another week rooting in silence for dylan to magically choose the movie i’m thinking for the next movie comentary since i can’t recommend it or he will hate me forever
HOLY SHIT YESSS THIS IS DREAM COME TRUEE
So weird that I randomly started watching this for the first time yesterday and this pops up 😂 I might just watch this instead honestly
hey @DylanIsInTrouble what is the brand of your wireless headphones? Thank you.
Please we need a unicorn academy commentary 😂💗🦄
5:12  Uncle Ben: "She's pretty" Dylan: "Thanks, i like to secretly take photos of her."
Most people consider this the worst of the three Spider-Man franchises. But it’s by far my favorite. You must watch the second movie. Whether with us or not you have to watch it.
Kurtis is here?  Kurtisss
Dylan didn’t do any scary movies for Halloween and I want to hear him scream 😞
Hiiiiiii! Thank youuuuuu! Great video 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂
i love how dylan shames peter for all his stalker activities when in actuality that's what we do with celebrities anyways
Look at the notebook
Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were so cute. It still makes me sad they didn't work out.
thank you for uploading on this fine monday, i know it’s so hard maintaining a consistent routine as a writer and a fine college grad
Best. Spiderman. EVER.
“He gave Peter free milk so it’s not that bad” … yeah ok, makes sense, checks out. Let him go free 😂
Your process of picking a movie maddening
dylan so real for this. Wbk this the best spiderman movie.
I feel like if this movie was just set in college so much of it would make more sense
I’ve been bitten by the love bug 😂
gwen and peters chemistry in this movie is some of the best romantic chemistry i’ve seen. i love it.
my favourite man watching my other favourite man. today is a good day
Please do Amazing Spider man 2 now🙌🏻🙌🏻
After all these years, I'm beginning to appreciate Andrew's Spiderman. It still doesn't have the Spiderman vibe but it's okay. I think it's because MCU made so that he isn't seen as a replacement for Tobey because Tobey brought the feel of Spiderman. So having them exist in their separate universe kinda reduced the hate I think people had for it . This isn't still the best Spiderman though, just saying 🙂
love the video! Laughed at that ONE joke (and i mean ONE, i laughed once, at that VERY funny joke)
I had to pause this too many times because I kept laughing remembering the Bad Lip Reading of this movie. Thankfully it paused first time whenever I hit the space bar.
is it just me or does Dylan look like he's been working out?
Ey guys! I actually think we will see him next monday!!!!
Still waiting for the third movie 🥲 And please watch the second movie too.
every time he comments a famous movie/tv serie like this one im like how is possible u never watch that shit maaannnn also i love these videossjsbavagha
yesssssssssss my fav
Finally someone who agrees with me! Andrew was the best spider man
Some of these jokes would hit for the second one lmfaoooooooo
I'm pretty sure she meant she's been bitten by the love bug 18:05
I have no clue why AG Spider-Man got so much hate. It’s top tier.
OMG i can't wait to watch this!! Andrew Garfield's Spiderman is my favorite!
this might be the closest thing to a movie commentary monday we could get
andrew garfield is the best spiderman
Dylan, i’m still waiting on my star wars marathon!!!
watch the sequel, that death scene is heartbreaking
Bitten by the lovebug Dylan!
17:47 Gwen says "So have I" because she thinks Peter is telling her he's been bitten by the *"lovebug"*
Not five minutes in and a Dead Uncle Ben joke is made. Dylan kills me
Andrew is my favorite Spiderman! I love these I'm so sad he only got two where the other ones got 3
OMG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
dylan pls acquaint yourself with the talent who is denis leary. his delivery is his comedy. the ref is a great xmas movie if youve never seen him in anything before. he is also in the thomas crown affair from the 90s not the 60s
6:45 Currently watching in a lab fully knowing I’ve had our interns working with bioreactors 😂
Ye me too😂 I cant
My fave spiderman🫶🏻
Dylan needs to watch the Amazing Spider-Man 2 then Spider-Man No Way Home… I’m just saying
YES YES YES
In my opinion i definitely think this is the best spiderman out of the trio, love Toby Maguire and Tom Holland but Andrew Garfield is my favourite.
She got bit by a love bug, Dylan. And because you brought it up, Unicorn Academy please.
Coming home from school to see that Dylan posted a video >>
watch the next amazing spiderman !
out of all the movies out there this one would've been my request for dylan. watched it a thousand times this year and now I'll do the same with this commentary. thank you for your service sir
el dorado 👀👀 that would be an amazing movie commentary JUST SAYING it's NOT a suggestion 😅
Love the drama with dylan and the disney pause button, never fails to entertain me
new Yorkers are so used to seeing wild shit seeing someone do that isn't nothing lmaooo
please don't ever say ai ai ai again dylan FOR MY MENTAL HEALTH AND SELF LOVE
his jokes are so pathetic. i'm in love with him.
Hi I just really want you to react to a cw "movie". Its a four episode crossover called crisis on earth x and it has the flash in it since you reacted to the show. And I thinj you would be impressed cause the cw did a really great job in this one and you might like DC heroes
MALL COP IS PEAK
i cant breathe dylan is so gorgeous in this
Neden bu kadar yakışıklısın Allah’ın cezası
I seriously forgot that today was monday thanks for the heads up Dylan 🤣
“What was she bitten by?” She meant the love bug
it’s great! we love the garf, but can you still do the across the spider-verse?🥺
The Andrew Garfield Spiderman has always been my favorite movies to watch! I'm really glad Dylan is making a video on them
I'm so glad he liked this movie, Andrew is my favorite Spiderman 😭I was so worried he'd dislike it, so many people gave it so much hate when it came out
I knew you would like Andrews humor
Dylan ignoring every new long-awaited movie and instead choosing the most random stuff he can stumble upon is honestly kind of inspiring.
My two favorites colliding - Andrew Garfield is truly the best spiderman
Dang, my husband and I just watched this movie for the first time last night since it came out. Something is off about it, I can tell if it’s the pacing or the tonal inconsistency. Love Andrew Garfield though
I've always liked TASM 1 and 2, 2 less so, I know they have a lot of problems but Andrew as Spider-man and him and Emma's chemistry is top tier to me
Bring on the unicorn 🦄!
Dylan making the joke about how the killer of uncle Ben gave spider man some milk and then later in the video saying that it’s now “even Steven” has me chuckling for life
brother I thought you were doing cpr on your chair
NO WAYYY! I just rewatched it the past friday and I never thought you would react to it 😭😭
Dylan for all our sake PLEASE JUST CLICK THE PAUSE BUTTON WITH THE MOUSE
Dylan saying “what are you a junior?” right after Gwen says I’m a senior is peak comedy
Literally the best Spider-Man movie
Watching his videos is like a toxic relationship. I get so pissed off when he want to nitpick things that don't matter and the movie already told him he was wrong about. Then get so happy and excited because he likes the same things I do. Idk, I think I can fix him tho.
literally astv is the best spider-man movie wym
I literally came to Dylans channel to check if it was Monday, Mondays really are the best
Please watch the Amazing Spiderman 2 as well. I wanna see your reaction to some... Choices 😂
A dumb coat without sleeves!? Dylan I think you mean vest. It’s a vest lmao
This commentary is the most Dylan thing Dylan has ever done
Gwen meant she’s been bitten by a love bug
needed this after a tiring monday
a dylan video is never complete without him mentioning how much he hates the disney plus space bar a million times 😭
Finally some love for Amazing Spider-Man !
I don't mind this sponsorship
I actually put Unicorn Academy on my list too. Note that I’m 25, just a smidge older than Dylan 😂
She was talking about a love bite 17:44  @DylanIsInTrouble
thank god we have Dylan
I love that shirt!  It looks good on you too Mr. Dylan.  😄
27:50 I LOVE the delivery of this joke, it’s so good 😆
"With great responsibility, comes great territory."
Hey dylan your videos never fail to make me cringe, thanks for making them
Andrew will always be my spiderman
Miss Irrfan. RIP
YOU FINALLY LEARNED HOW TO PAUSE ON DISNEY +!!!! I feel like I've waited decades for this moment
THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED 🥰🥰
please watch el dorado omg
Dylan getting the one quote from the entire movie that’s the most important wrong is so on brand
Watch the first and last episode of big bang theroy
Can Dennis Leary ONLY deliver cheesy movie one liners? Who lets this man act?  Also my favorite thing about Dylan is when he tells a joke that isnt very funny, he calls back to it until it becomes funny. Thats his superpower. 😂
Love it when you do Superheroes. And who's gonna tell Dylan that people consider this as a terrible Spider-Man movie?
my FAVORITE spider-man. lowkey also my favorite spider-man movies to rewatch. idc fight me
Andrew is and will always be my favorite Spider-Man
"I've been bitten"... by the lovebug
The only thing i hated about this movie is how stupid they make his powers look as peter at school specifically
Bitten by a LOVE BUG, Dylan 😂 @18:00
Their chemistry is by far the best and gets even stronger in the 2nd.
Dylan: It's a misdirect! Us: Oh yeah youre right it is. Dylan: SEE I TOLD YOU!
The reason a lot of people don’t like this is because we didn’t want another Spider-Man origin story because we already had one with Tobey. Also my biggest complaint was he wasn’t Peter. The way he showed off after he got his powers is realistically how a teenager would act but Peter always held back. I liked his jokes and stuff when he was in the suit but it didn’t work for me outside of that.
5:37 the marauders fans are quaking
fall came but the summer foundation stayed
Dylan she means she was bit by Lovebug!
bit by a love bug dylan 😂 that’s what she was referring to
the chair creeks in moments of silence are SENDING ME😂😂 so hilarious fr
“His voice went bonk bonk bonk into that ear” < is what you find when you look up the word echo
60504th
I always knew Dylan had taste.
Second one is a must now, can’t leave us hanging
You better watch the new spiderman though
Watch the second one!!!
My heart hurts for all the people I come across who watched No Way Home without watching these Amazing Spiderman movies so they don't get the full emotional impact of this Peter making the catch 😔
But what happened to the Bubly
*WORST
This is also my fave Spider-Man film❤❤❤❤
Dylan is the only reason I wake up on Mondays, such a punctual content creator 😂😂😂
I can believe for the first time in my life I audibly laughed at ONE of his jokes. He is so funny with that ONE joke.🤣
"So was I" explanation.  There is a term of endearment statement that goes, "bitten, by the love bug." That's it. That's the reference.  Her "so was I" implies she was bitten by the love bug.
I'd watch anything with Dylan 😁✨
te amo Dylan
when i saw the notification, i screamed
Phenomenal episode
Andrew has always been my favourite. He’s the most comic accurate Spider-Man AND Peter Parker!
Damn this video was uploaded 3 hrs ago and it already has 1k comments
I had 2 doughnuts today.
BESTTTT
I really thought it was monday, im going mad
Andrew's Spiderman is my fave, always has been
i want an unicorn academy commentary 🧍‍♀️
My favorite spiderman, I knew Dylan would enjoy it
Andrew Garfield was absolutely amazing for Spider Man
This rendition of spiderman would get so much hate! I'm happy you're appreciating it dylan😭
I LOVE YOU THANK YOU FOR UPLOADING THIS OH MY GOD I LOOOVEEEE THIS FILM SO MUCH  😭😭😭😭😭
watch one piece
Man i couldve swore yesterday was Monday! Silly me
this is the best day of my life
i just know this video is gonna produce a lot of tiktok thrit traps 🤭
okay but the way i (internally) screamed when i saw that dylan reacted to the Garf as spidey i couldn't have been more excited!
Andrew Garfield W
But.. but across the spiderverse
Would be hilarious if after all that time you could've changed the space button to play/pause in the settings 😂😂😂
YES THIS IS MY FAVORITE SPIDERMAN MOVIE
i think Dylan should do another episode story i miss that series it was so much fun (Dylan if you happen to see this i suggest doing the k*ss list you get to chose who your kissing )
i agree wholly
Dylan. Thank you.
every week monday is redefined
When dylan said he has done call backs to jokes, who else thought about meat pack?!
the way Dylan said “damn clumsy b1tch” @25:16 took me out 😭😭
“Is that a real knife?! My weakness, it’s small knives” had be doubling over with laughter and I’m glad it did the same for Dylan 🤣 such a good movie
She thoght he was saying that he's been bitten by the "love bug". And she said: "So have I."
The timing of this video is the best. This week has been awful. A family member has passed away last week and I'm not doing great. I find myself rewatching your video's to distract myself and try to have sort of a nice time. I've seen all of your video's, so it's great you've posted a new one to watch and laugh about. Your video's are helping me through a tough time. Thank you so much ❤
"With great responsibility comes great territory"-Dylan
Well we’ll welll, Disney FINALLY took Dylan’s pause butto suggestions. It about time… 💀
I understoood the “me too” when peter says he’s been bit to be alluding to the “love bug” term
andrews amazing spiderman has always been my favorite!! there's such a prfound sadness to them, and the humor works so well - i never understood why people used to hate these movies, i'm gad its changing and andrew is getting his well deserved praise though!!
PLEASE WATCH THE SECOND ONE DYLAN
I gotta say I’m down for the unicorn academy review 😂
18:09 I AM DYING OF LAUGHTER THAT LINE DELIVERY WAS AMAZING 😭💀😭
@17:58 I think she meant bit by the “love bug” Dylan
I didn’t know I wanted or needed this but WATCH PART TWO!!!!!
we need the paul blart commentary tho
“Does he have the Men in Black memory eraser?…What are these people thinking in their heads?! “Wow that is crazy. Well I guess I should get to math.”  Dylan you forget it’s New York. New York has seen a lot of shit and doesn’t care, it minds it’s business 😂
You know watching this now, I realise how funny this movie actually was 😂😂
I hope the title isn’t sarcastic bc yes this is the best Spider-Man movie. I will not stand for the Andrew Garfield slander
This will forever be the best spidermans! Great acting, great storyline, great soundtrack. Good cgi.  Andrew will forever be my Spiderman!
Almost Dylan... Just one day, just one single day
I wonder if Dylan’s book will finally be released on a Monday
dylan had such an opportunity. "what an enjoyable experience...i'd give it an easy a."
Dylan has been my celebrity crush since I was 11 😂❤
In the original uncut version, Peter's dad is more _actively_ involved with the storyline. Peter and his dad has a very intense dialogue at the cemetery when Peter was visiting Uncle Ben's grave.
I absolutely love the first TASM!! It was sooooo good. The second one, though, was a complete mess beside Peter and Gwen’s love story. It honestly felt like there’s two different films happening in the same movie😂
Just came home from school and I turned on my phone and saw Dylan posted and I almost cried for happiness 🥹
Guys we’re getting closer and closer to an actual movie commentary Monday !
Omg finally
Let's goooooo! 🤩 Great commentary
random note, but I really like your shirt
Wait- was this video sponsored? I can’t tell…. 😂
The "Easy A " joke was funny.I chuckled .
Btw no one loved this movie until No Way Home but I was there from the beginning before it was cool
DYLANNNNNNNN! Do the second movieeee.
*Unicorn Academy comes up*  Dylan - “LET ME EXPLAIN”  Also Dylan— no explanation given   Trying to understand Dylan’s actual taste in media is an absolute rollercoaster 😂
Im in for dylan watching unicorn academy
“great responsibility comes with great territory” - Uncle Dylan
dylan uploading after a horrible day will never fail to make me feel better
MY JAW DROPPED WHEN I SAW THIS ON MY HOME PAGE SOOOO EXCITEDDDD
Not only did I momentarily scream when I got the notification on this- (because of how much of a marauders fan/remus fan I am) but the fact that Dylan made that HARRY POTTER REFERENCE??? Bro summoned a whole made up fandom based on like three lines of an actual franchise 😭💀
Dylan watch TASM2 as well I beg 🙏🙏🙏
Dude I litterally rewatched all of the maguire and garfield Spider-Mans like last week, this is perfect timing. TASM 1 is the best live action Spider-Man origin to date. Also, don’t Liston to the critics of TASM 2 it’s good
The Disney control-thing to  put that order on "space" that you used last is SO annoying!
Anyone else: a vest Dylan: dumb coat without sleeves
I have a spider tattoo…🧍
Exactly on Monday. Amazing
ive been waiting for this one for a long long time
Andrew Garfield is always been my favourite Spiderman. I love him and Emma's chemistry so much
"With great responsibility comes great territory"  - Dylan, 2023
I love you
This is why I look forward to every Monday
You were really in La La Land trying to get that Easy A joke, weren’t ya? …I’ll see myself out
Bro has Road To El Dorado in his list of movies, what a chad
I absolutely would love for you to review Unicorn Academy. But only as a first and last.
this movie was so good and then they totally dropped the ball with the sequel
He's just getting closer and closer to Monday
I love how dylan actually loves this. It was my favorite movie and andrew was my fav spiderman. I absolutely hated how everyone treated it so badly back in 2014.
Instant click. Always been one of my favorite movies and loved Andrew as Spider-Man.
Dylan’s beef with the Disney pause button will forever be funny
I have come to disagree and say Toblerone's was the best
“with great responsibility comes great territory”   Dylan outdid himself here
If Dylan ever watches something on Disney you know at least half of the video is gonna be him fighting the space bar
I don't know what Unicorn Academy is but id watch it with you Dylan 🌻. Oh and i think she meant I've been bitten by the love bug. You never heard of that saying, love bug.
I JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE THIS MORNING!
Let's goooo!!!! The Amazing Spider-man represent. If he clickbaited, fuck you haha
It’s weird, I’ve never seen this shirt before
Ppl hated the Amazing Spiderman because they were mad it ended Tobey's run.   The overall consensus is that Tobey was the best Peter, Andrew was the best spiderman, and Tom is good at both.  This Spiderman is great, moves like a spider, funny, etc.   This Peter was too "cool", the whole skating scene was laughed at.
Why does nobody ever talk about how weird the scene after the shattering of the backboard is? Like, it's obviously cut weird with how the ring is NOT in his hands when he lands but then suddenly it is 🫠🙃
Did not expect this today but anyway I loooove Spiderman
Every time i'm having a bad day I watch your videos and laugh my ass off so thank you Dylan for making my life a little bit bearable😁❤
You could’ve worked in the Easy A joke when Gwen mentioned tutoring Flash in the beginning
Andrew Spiderman the best spiderman movie? EH? Since when? Its like the worst one. Im not saying its bad or horrible, but its not the best. Wait...is this where you say something thats not true so people will argue with you in the comments? I see what you did there. Also, did you pay for the HD netflix? Cause they changed it a while back, so if you want to watch things in HD you now have to pay extra for that. It could be that youre just on the base model and not paying for the HD model.
Each time he is getting closer to Mondays
It’s Dylan!!
Dylan let me borrow 100 bucks
Starting to feel like Dylan only watches stuff on Disney plus so he can complain about the pause button.
Andrew is my favorite Spider-Man, I'm so glad you liked that movie ❤
The second movie it’s better with Andrew Garfield!
never thought this one would happen but I'm so happy it did lessgooo
Nice movie, you can really see that Gwen really *fell* for peter
I think she meant love bite?😀
The chair creaking in the awkward moments makes these videos
22:52 ouch
The comment bots really ruined the Monday gag lmao
I can't believe Dylan was so close to doing a commentary on one of my favorite movies🥲 also I am so jealous that atsv is on netflix in the us
Unicorn academy is a masterpiece... 😤don't bait me like that.
And then Sony had to f everything up with the 2nd movie. I still liked parts of it but wish it was better.
Recent subscriber here... I've been binge watching Dylan's videos for like the past week and a half, this'll probably be the last time I comment but I'm glad to be a part of this community😊
Dylan talking about girls who like spiders and me immediately feeling attacked cause i have two that i love living in my patio lol one's a golden orb weaver and the other one is a silver spider
I watched this when I was little but now, after investing some time in photography, I realize there is no way he could spy on people by zooming using that tiny fixed lens and camera.
Just one day off from a Monday lmaoo
You can’t say this is the best until you’ve seen the animated trilogy lol
OMFG DYLAN AND ANDREW???? this was a video for ME
This video gets an easy A
I always assumed the whole "I was bitten" "so was i" was her thinking he meant by the Love Bug 😄 never questioned it
andrew garfield carries so hard
She was bitten by the love bug!! That's why she said "So have I"
I have also seen all the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, except for the first one haha
Latinamerica loves you Dylan, thank you for posting every single Monday.
W opinion
Easy F… DYLAN
YESSSSSS BASED ANDREW WAS THE BEST PETER
Dylan: "With great responsibility, comes great territory." Me: "Sir, that is not the line." 😂
Bruh where tf the kung fu panda 2😭
Dylan I hope you know this means you gotta watch the second one and do a video on it for us.
He spoke with such conviction at the end there I really thought he posted this on a monday
"Great responsibility comes with great territory" -Dylan 2023 😂
DYLAN SPEAKING THE TRUTH
There's a phrase that goes something along the lines of being "bitten by the lovebug," i think, so when Peter said that he was bitten, gwen interpreted it as a confession basically, and also that she feels the same way. That or i'm making this all up.
you are so real for making this video, my fav spiderman fr
OMG UNFAIR, SPIDERMAN ATSV ISNT AVAILABLE IN THE UK NOOOOO
i kid you not i literally watched that yesterday holy damn
Bitten … so have I… by a bug… a lovebug…
Andrew did the best body acting compared to other Spider-Man’s!!! Dylan giggled at 14:39 proved it
Omg Dylan got a new shirt
the way this was almost uploaded on monday?! this is record time omg
I just want to say i watched unicorn academy in it's entirety and it's not the best bUt it could be much worse 1st episode though kind of a banger
I don’t know if cause I haven’t been able to watch a video in a minute but is this is most chaotic reaction ? 😂😂😂😂
BEST SPIDER-MAN!!!
9:30-10:40 and 14:28 -14:43 had me laughing so hard 😭
I really wanna watch another sequel to Andrew's Spiderman,where he stopped pulling his punches 💔
Is he being sarcastic when he says he only hears people talking about how good The amazing spider-man is??
Ohh man, you're really slipping into THAT genre, getting more mainstream again. What about some comedies like you used to do often in the past? There are still numerous out there, for example "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton (2004)", others as well. You can do that one! As long as The Movie Budz don't get it to it soon, you'll be the first!
Not having Dylan slide in a sponsorship feels odd
Bit by the love bug. 😂
way to commit to the bit dylan. it IS very funny to make a video on a decade old spiderman movie instead of the new one.
I love the Andrew Garfield ones. I hope you like it.
In my heart it is Monday
as someone who likes spiders more than a bunch of animals, I'd be too paranoid to know if I like/dislike that obsessive approach
Less than a minute in, and I already need a new ringtone with that Spider-Man jingle you opened with 😂
the way i squealed when i saw this video omg😭 andrew garfield’s is the best spider-man and peter parker idc
Dylan, not all girls who like spiders will like to be stalked by a handsome guy. But if he's handsome AND rich... 👀😏
Gwen was bitten by the LOVE BUG, DYLAN get a clue its a movie about bug bites 🤣
Now i truly need the unicorn academy commentary to be happy
i'm literally in the middle of every spider-man movie rewatch binge, you couldn't be more on theme this monday!
You absolutely gotta do el dorado next that was my childhood I gotta see your reaction 👏👏👏
Thank you for appreciating this movie ! Its my fav spiderman franchise. I absolutely loveee Andrew's portrayal of Peter/Spiderman
My roman empire: Dylan deleting his other channel
He needs to watch the sequel!!!
16:42 this is kinda strange...how did he predict my face so perfectlyI thought this is a one way medium, we watch him. Not the other way
now we need part twooooooooo
this is gold
“Great responsibility comes with great territory”  -Dylan
Andrew Garfield is the best Spider Man, and I’m dying in this hill
Dylan should watch HISHE!
5:03
This is so weird because just yesterday I started watching this movie again
Dylans high pitched voice whenever something stressful happens is so funny to me
As soon as i saw the title i clicked, dylan has confirmed what ive always known is true
Just in time for me to watch while taking a break from studying
Still waiting for Dylan's explanation as to why he has Unicorn Academy on his list of things to watch. 😂
I haven’t seen this movie in a hot minute but the foreshadowing of Gwen’s death is great
love how as time goes by his videos get closer and closer to Monday! we appreciate it Dylan
Can we actually look at the film and not have it paused every three seconds
She was bitten as in by the lovebug, Dylan 😂
This was great and I hope above all hopes that you do the second one next because I'm SO curious what you'll say about it! Thanks for the content Dylan!
this is right up my ally
DYLAN COVERING THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE?? YESSSS
I’ve been debating it but now I have to watch Unicorn academy, thanks for the sign Dylan!
She was bitten by THE LOVE BUG DYLAN!! Lmao sometimes you're so smart and other times things go right over your head 😂
IT'S MONDAY MY DUDES
Which is better meat pack or Easy A...that's an easy answer 😂
I love how half of Dylan's videos are him having a 1v1 with the progress bar
Bitten by a Love Bug you goof.
Dylan trying to justify Unicorn Academy is me with Miraculous Ladybug
bitten by a lovebug ¿? who knows
Hi Dylan 👋🏼 I’m pretty sure that in minute 18:00 of your video Gwen means that she has been bitten by a love bug. Like the saying “bitten by a love bug” meaning that your falling in love.
I saw this movie like 4 times in theaters. I love it.
i can't believe you did a movie commentary about my favorite spider-man, you're a real one dylan <3
you should’ve referenced the movie Easy A that emma stone was in. it would’ve been funny if you incorporated that in
petition for Dylan to do unicorn academy commentary
PLZZZZ actually react to across the spiderverse...i beg
21:48 all I can think of is meat pack
A little too late for this dylan😂
TITLE IS BASED
Dylan if you watch the sequel it has a moment you want for that easy A joke 😂
20:32 that was such a "u ladies alright?" kinda moment lmfao
I’m sorry but DID HE NOT REALIZE what he did the THE “EASY A” REFERENCE??? All he said was, “cuz she’s a good teacher” and not, “cuz of the movie”
I'm so glad you didn't do cross the spider-verse lol
I wish you watched Spider-Man across the spider verse though 😭
This is my favourite Spider-Man series. I'm still so mad it never became a trilogy. They robbed andrew garfield so bad ❤🎉😢
What happens with FPS of you camera??
our mayor in a Dylan video??
I loved this video especially since this is my favourite spider-man🥹❤️I just wished i could watch Dylan react to the swinging scene at the end🥲
Even if the movies weren't great, nobody can deny that Andrew is the best actor out of the 3 spiders
one of the worst spider man movies
When she said so have I after ive been bitten she meant the love bug...
Dylan got so far that disney listened to his suggestion about the play button 👏👏
BROS WATCHING MY FAVORITE SPIDER-MAN
Dylan starts by singing and my head “spider pig, spider pig, does whatever a spider pig dies, can he swing, from a web, no he he can’t he’s a pig look out, he is a spider pig”🙃 if you’re  reading this hope you have a good day!
10:07 this cracked me up so hard 🤣🤣🤣 Dylan explaining for 2 mins that Gwen will hear Uncle Ben saying Peter has her as his screensaver then Uncle Ben saying it directly to her just cracked me up 😂😂😂😂😂 I have tears in my eyes
Changing to warm lighting is the best decision he has ever made ❤🩷😘
18:17 by the love bug, Dylan
the scene where the construction cranes lead a path for spiderman to swing to the tower has always been my favorite scene in a spiderman film! idk but it's something about how the good he does in the mask has a positive effect on the people he helps has the people helping in return. i dont see that a lot in the newer spiderman films (ive never seen the tobey maguire ones tho) but i think it really emphasizes the "friendly neighborhood" part to his reputation here :)
21:48 it reminded me of the marbles' joke
If there's not Unicorn Academy commentary next Movie commentary monday, there is no God. (Spoiler)
8:35 Wait till you get to “You’re my boy.”, you’ll get it.
Bitten by the love bug!
I love you so much Dylan you bring me tons of joy watching your videos! I always look forward to you posting new reactions and commentary’s. Thank you!🤣🥰👍🏼
29:58 "What a pretty girl!" "Yeah, she's my screensaver." Ok, This one broke me Dylan x'D
hahaha, I think Emma's been "bitten" by the love bug Dylan
pleaaaseeee watch the amazing spider man 2, its unfortunately not as good which is why i know dylan is gonna have more fun with it
Unicorn academy commentary?
Dylan seemed to giggle a LOT in this video 😂
Dylan promoting bubly just like he’s all that promoted core water was so funny to me 😂
BOYCOTT DISNEY!!!!!!!!! 🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴
We need the last installment of Amazing Spiderman to finish the trilogy 😭
I love Andrew Garfield as Spiderman. I really wish we got an Amazing Spiderman 3 with Black Cat lol
What a nice monday it is to watch Dylan's new video
this is the most random movie commentary, but i'm all for it.
I have never met anyone who agrees that this is the best spiderman live action movie. Thank you dylan 👍🏿
Oh please do the second movie too please ❤
Andrew is the best Spider-Man period!
Peters Uncle: *gets murdered* Dylan: Yeahh but Peter did get a free chocolate milk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I just finished Ultimate Spider Man (PS2 game) today and then you uploaded this. Fate!! Lol
bruv its not monday innit?
YEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!! YEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everyday we further stray from gettin to monday
Only Dylan can make a joke funnier by explaining it 😂
Dylan, "bitten by the love bug" is a phrase that exists lol
So nice to see the good word of TASM being spread. God’s work, Dylan!
18:16 you don’t know the expression "bitten by love" 😂?
MAAAN YOU GOTTA WATCH THE MALL COP! PLEASE MAKE A COMMENTARY ON THAT ONE IT IS HILARIOUS....sorry for yelling🤗
man i love Andrew as Spiderman, he´s the best one!
dylans hate relationship with the disney space bar is hilarious
Yay! Favorite YouTuber watching my favorite Spidey! This day was an Easy A
Command for the algoritm😉
8:54 😲  11:38 he's alive!?  14:27 🔪  17:37
Dylan watching a marvel movie is a rare occurrence
THE KURTIS CONNOR REFERENCE JAHAJA, PLEASE VIDEOS WITH HIM, MY TWO FAVORITE YOUTUBERS
And when we needed him the most......... He appeared
Cannot believe I am saying this but Dylan I dont agree with you, Spiderman into the spiderverse is better and across is amazing as well It is the best live action spiderman film tho
I demand a unicorn academy commentary, you can't just tease us with that glimpse and then shut it down like that.
I personally liked Andrews Spider-Man the best, and Gwen was the best love interest, the only problem is that the rest of the the movie is lacking (In my humble opinion.) And he was the best character in No Way Home, too
i’ve been waiting for one of these!!! spider-man AND dylan!!! TURN IT UP🤩🤩
THIS WAS SO GOOD ❤❤❤❤ Hope you watch the second movie too!!
Dylan, are you going to do the Top Gun movies?!
DYLAN GWEN LITERALLY TALKS ABOUT HOW SHE STUDIES WITH FLASH 😭😭😭
Watching Dylan unironically enjoying this movie is so fun Especially considering that AG's spiderman movies are the least appreciated
dylan mentioning kurtis conner while watching spiderman? my 3 worlds colliding fr
She was bitten by the "love bug" lol
El Dorado is on your list, please do a commentary when you watch it. 🙏
Ok but why did i laugh so hard at the Easy F joke? 😂😂😂
she was bitten by the love bug
1:12 Dylan is a brony, confirmed.
HAVEN'T WATCH THE VIDEO YET BUT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE TITLE
Completely unrelated but recently I have been seeing SO MANY TikTok edits of you and they’re rlly something. I know it’s cringe for 30 yr olds to have TikTok but ur 20 innit so u should be fine and it would be absolutely hilarious to see you watch them
if you don't watch unicorn academy, i will
Irrfan Khan </3
Boycott Disney! They support apartheid!!! And the play/pause button sucks
4:35 When you were talking about your chair, I looked away for two seconds and the noise, I thought you fell back out of your chair 🤣
dylan reacting to my favourite movie ever is this heaven
i like it when the guy posts
This is it, this is where Dylan gets cancelled. RiP boogies
kurtis and dylan interaction omg
It was my favourite spider man as well
Andrew is my favourite Spiderman, so this video made me beyond happy. I know the movie itself isn't great, and they really shove that Sony ownership down your throat, and the Spiderverse movies are genuinely superior, but Andrew really embodied Peter as I remember him from the comics and I am so grateful to him for that.  P.S. By 'bitten' I think she means a love bug, that's a very 50's term. It's godawful and I cringe horribly every time I have to endure it. And you made me listen to it TWICE, damn you.
She was "bitten by a love bug"
🗣️SHE WAS BITTEN BY THE LOVE BUG!
chop chop movie boy, you chose this life!
3 Easy-A references?? Dylan, you're spoiling us today!
Not this slander against the girls who love spiders, it's not truuuuue 😭
Please do the sequel:)
OMG NO WAY I LOVE THAT ONE AAAAAA
MY BDAY GIFT FR
Gwen: I'm a senior at midtown high Dylan: THEY GOT A JUNIOR TO BE HEAD INTERN??
This is my favorite Spider-Man ❤️❤️❤️
Not the Kurtis joke ☠️
Idk if u did Tom Hollanda spider man but I'd love to see that reaction
Dylan is the first person I know who is also irritated by the Disney+ interface and it really makes me feel seen lol
that spiderman suit is just too good looking. wish it stayed practical for the tom holland movies
You have to watch the second one
i have such fun time seeing Dylan's reacting to every little thing Andrew does with his body acting as spiderman 😂😂😂
6:18 was the first time i've heard dylan mention other commentary YouTubers I watch (Kurtis) and now I need a collab.
Yess ma man
18:06 bitten by the love bug, Dylan. The love bug.
when peter says “i’ve been bitten” and gwen says “so have i”, it’s a reference to being ‘bitten by a love bug’ (what she thinks he’s saying) which is essentially the same as the “shot by cupid’s arrow” joke :p   also, the guy didn’t just steal a six pack, he also emptied the register.
“HOW NICE IS THAT DISNEY?!” 😂😂😂😂
This is absolutely in NO way a request……….. but there is a new mean girls movie coming out that is the same as the first movie just new actors and looks worse😂😂😂😂……. Just fyi :)
I like the 2nd movie even more lol
I'm glad people are now realizing how Goated Andrew's Spiderman was!!!!
I think Dylan hating Disney+’s UI is my favourite part when he does a commentary.😂
the squeal i let out when i saw this posted
When she says "so have I" she means she has been bitten by the "love bug". She thought he was saying that he had been bitten by the love bug and was confessing his feelings 😂
it would have been funny
Now you HAVE to do the second one🤷🏼‍♀️
Who remembers when this film first came out it got hated on so much & Andrew had his experience ruined due to the hate & Sony, there was suppose to be a third film… so sad it took people so long to appreciate these films. 😢
My mom came in when I was watching this and she looked at me like I was an alien  I was just giggling for a couple minutes strait
""skirting" around the rules", I'll take it
He can watch unicorn academy and I'll still sit here and laugh at my phone
Dylan taking nearly 2 years to learn how the Disney UI works is par for the course ngl.
I’m so glad you watched this movie, my favorite Spiderman movie for sure
This movie gave my 10 year old self trauma
I will never not laugh at how heated Dylan's relationship with the Disney plus UI is. 😂
nearly choked on the spacebar
Do Unicorn Academy. I've never even heard of that til now- but DO IT.
you did your own editing here, didn´t you dylan? still the best, no offence to joe
I feel like Dylan doesn't wear t-shirts anymore... something about it is sexy.
Love the Kurtis joke <3
Was searching for something to watch while having a midnight snack and here’s dylan uploading just in time 😼🙌🏻
The fact when these movies came out I felt like a one woman army defending them and Andrew against everyone but now everyone suddenly adores the films and Andrew… I fought for a worthy cause after all! 🫡
Wish it was tasm 2, would love to see Dylan’s reaction to the staircase scene
She's been bitten by the Love Bug, Dylan
Hmmm but it would be super great to see you react to Spider verse.
Bring that unicorn academy commentary!!
yes unicorn academy
With great responsibility comes great territory wtf 😭
I know u dont like recommendations but plzzzz do (DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS)
Tidbit: 6:56 The actor in frame is Irrfan Khan. He’s from India and we all love him here. He was such an amazing actor, but sadly passed away 3 years ago. His legacy still continues on though!
Dylan, stop trying to make Easy F happen, it's not going to happen. 😂
She was bitten by the love bug
Dude I LOVE the TASM and Andrew Garfield as Spiderman but everytime I talk to someone about this, they would disagree, but seeing Dylan say that the TASM is the best SM movie feels so nice!!! I really respect his choices in film and his views/reviews on content in general so this just makes me so happy!!!!!!    Edit - I always forget to mention Irfaan Khan in this movie cause that is such a surreal thing to me. Like he was one of the greatest actors of all time. He died of cancer a while ago. But his legacy and the stuff he did for the Indian film industry is very cool. Lost a gem 💎
Now you gotta do the second one. Can't wait for your jokes if you do that one because the jokes make themselves in TASM 2
i love andrew but justice for spiderverse 😔
Watch the 2nd movie!
When you get confused because you swear Dylan already watched this and then you remember that was Alex 😅😂
I’m waiting for the unicorn academy video!!!
2 videos in the same month🤩 I feel spoiled….  Thanks
Yes yes yes, Andrew is THE best Spiderman! 🤌🏻
You'll be thoroughly disappointed if you ever watch the sequel (the missing piece is easily identified: charm).
They drew the sketch of the Unabomber with his aviators on lol
i'm glad you watched The Amazing Spider-Man instead of the animated one
Dylan thank you for doing this spider man commentary, a personal favorite
Dylan shrieking at the Peter and Gwen scenes, oh he’s just like me fr
Dylan, Tuesday is way too close to Monday... don't scare me like this again
“with great responsibility, comes great territory”
i giggled when he mentioned harry potter (i need this comment to reach the right people)
I love Movie Commentary MondayTuesday !
Yesss the best Spider-Man. Just screams nostalgia as well, I remember watching in the cinema with my brothers
The funniest part of this whole thing is Dylan not know now New Yorkers react to crazy shit 😂😂 Edit:also a jacket with no sleeves ( a vest) imma start saying that
Okay I want to clarify stuff that Dylan was confused about! Gwen is a SENIOR at midtown high and she’s just the head of the interns. When she said she has “been bitten too” she’s meaning by a love bug. The guy didn’t just steal a 6 pack of beer he took the entire register too! Love your videos! This movie is one of my favorites!
one movie that Dylan enjoyed finally ❤❤❤🎉🎉
Confused by the everyone loves this movie
Bit by a love bug Dylan lol
you're so pretty Dylan
I hate how accurate the spider tattoo comment is
I think I might be losing it, I thought yesterday was Monday, I can’t believe I messed up.
FUCK YEAAAAAAAH I FUCKIN LOVE SPIDERMAN DUDE
didn’t know i needed a dylan and spider-man crossover
The most nonchalant sponsorship ever. Didn't even realize it was sponsored by Bubly bc i'm so used to casual plugs of either audbile or expressvpn. lmao
Toby got the sad. Tom got the goofy awkward. Andrew did it all plus the charm and it’s perfect.   My biggest problem with this movie is the random lizards running around. It just doesn’t make sense to me. And as someone who only has half an arm on one side I struggle with way one armed people are portrayed in film. It’s so inaccurate and more often then not we’re the bad guys (see connors, us Marshall’s, iron man 3 and Captain Hook). But this is still my favorite Spider-Man.
Wait, did Dylan miss him catching the bad guy that killed Uncle Ben?
it feels illegal to be this early
disintegrating at the “great territory” line (are we playing Risk?) and the absolutely convoluted Easy A joke that couldn’t fit but he told anyway (edit: four times). I luv it here
Dylan she meant she had been bitten by the love bug 😂😂😂
Andrew Garfield is my Spiderman😭🩷
The tension between Dylan and the space bar is just too intense I fear
Andrew has always been my favourite and no one will ever change my mind, so excited for this video
Probably have seen this movie at least 20 times and still would watch it again. Your reviews are fun man.
Dylan thinks TASM is the best Spider-Man movie? Dylan is Based?
Excuse me, I want to watch a unicorn academy commentary.
I was in a really sour mood today and he dropped a commentary on my Favourite Spider Man movie. I call this Fate and I love you Dylannnnn
The easy f joke saved my year
Bro calling Uncle Ben evil at the start. 😂😂 Bruv.
Dylan knows what’s up. TASM was a vibe that’s just different than the rest.
The nose ring does work he doesn't look 40 I am impressed  (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)
OMG I JUST SCREAMEDDDD GSZXSHAHYUSHHAJA,THANK XOU DYLANNNNN♡♡♡
It's my favorite Spider-man movie! Andrew and Emma chemistry was something else!
the best part of my mondays
do you post uncut reactions anywhere?
So happy it’s Monday and we get more videos from Dylan 😂🫶🏻
Andrew was always my favorite because the first Spider-Man movie I ever watched was TASM2 when it came to theaters. As a 12 year old girl that was never interested in superheroes before, this movie hooked me and made me the geek I am today💀💀
Do a transformers marathon next? Those are hilarious
That one joke you made really made me laugh, Dylan
Dylan’s beef with the space bar and him will always be funny 💀
now you HAVE to watch  spider-man into the spider verse or i'll DIE
Ah yes, the famous Spider-Man line "with great responsibility, comes great territory"
HES FINALLY GOT A NEW SHIRT
Dylans inner 13 year old girl came out when Andrew and Emma were about to kiss IS PEAK
Eyvallah
18:15 i think she meant "bit by a love bug"
it's kinda scary the fact that you posted this video when i literally just finished the amazing spiderman but i guess i'll just ignore it and watch the video
She thought he was saying he was bitten by love, is that not a saying? Idk
Legit just watched this while at work 🤭
FINALLY I CAN AGREE WITH DYLAN ON SMTH
❤from morocco all love
You gotts watch the second movie too!
crazy how this one is now thought of as the favorite spider-man film when a few years ago you would have been executed in the town square for saying that
it’s a good day when there’s a new dylan video. the smile i had when i saw this notification was huge
The opportunity for the "Easy A" joke was there when she was talking to Flash about tutoring, you missed it 😭
"imagine a video player, that when you hit the spacebar, 100% of the time, it would just play." 0% pause
Im not sure if im more attracted to dylan or his editor
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOGMGOKG YESSSSS DYLAN IS FINALLY REACTING TO SPIDERMAN EEEE 😭💕💕 I’ve been wanting this reaction for so long but I never suggested it cuz Dylan doesn’t like suggestions 😂😂
Dylan, is that a new shirt?
YES SOMEONE AGREES THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE AND ACTOR
He NEEDS to react to The Amazing Spider-man 2
Only halfway through but I really love this video. It's so nice to just see Dylan enjoy himself with this one:D
alex heffners better he actually watches the fucking movies and takes it serious
I kept yelling at the screen “It’s 2012! Think 2012” the entire beginning. It really was of the era. But Andrew and Emma’s charisma and comedic timing was just lightening in a bottle on top of their chemistry. I hated they didn’t continue the series but I also dreaded what it would be w/o that. No other screen partner could live up to that chemistry at the time.
"With great responsibilities, comes with great territories"   😭😭😭
happy Monday everyone
You remind me of Andrew Garfield
dylan wanting somebody dead not even within 5 minutes in to the movie is so on brand
he killed the uncle but he gave andrew chocolate milk hmmm he's a good guy
i have never been so excited to watch a video in my life, do the others too please
Idk why this Spider-Man’s mannerisms just remind me of Bella from twilight but it do
Petition to re-upload this vid with red and blue lamps😂
I imagine Amanda The Jedi immediately clicking on this because how have you not seen The Amazing Spider-Man!?
Idk about you guys but It’s a Monday for me
bitten by a love bug omg dylan
WE WANT UNICORN ACADEMY AND WE WANT IT NOW!!!!!!
OMG i'm watching unicorn academy rn it's actually so stupid and terrible i love it so much pls watch it soon dylan
I don't understand how 4 years ago Dylan looked like 20 and now he looks 25, he's lying about his age pretty sure.
Andrew Garfield: best Spider Man actor, worst Spider Man script
Perfect way to spend the night knowing full well I have to wake up early and go to work tomorrow. Worth it.
The kurtis Connor comment 😭
idk dylan the only girl I know that likes insects and stuff is a lesbian
Petition for Dylan to watch unicorn academy
Bitten by the lovebug Dylan. Also, I HATE these movies! I LOVE Peter Parker and Andrew is way too cool to play him! He’s a funny Spiderman tho.
17:45 ish This is my theory. She said “So have I” because she meant she was BIT by the love bug or something.
He missed out not watching the second one, that is the movie that is notorious for being a shit show, there would have been jokes for days
Yes, Dylan. It is the best Spider-Man movie. Thank you for the validation.
Now you have to see the second 🤷🏽‍♀️ it's the law
When will the react vid be up for the second one?
Now you need to react to into the spiderverse and across the spiderverse
We should all write to disney as a whole community saying how they should fix the space bar problem, but then again I love seeing him alla worked up about that every time lol
dylan please watch unicorn academy, i watched with my 6 yo cousin as a joke but its actually rlly good
very bonita
it’s crazy how consistent dylan is, never uploading on mondays
IM SO HAPPY WE HAVE THE SAME OPINION
I’ve come to a point where I can no longer watch a movie without wondering what would Dylan think about this
WHAT A GREAT DAY! you just made my day, thanks dylan<3
this is why i love dylan, thumbnail and caption saying andrew gardfields movies are the best (except nothing beats miles móralas)
“And I WILL see you again next Monday. TOODLES!”   And he never posted another video again
OMFG I JUST WATCHED THIS YESTERDAY 😂😂 I got into Spider-Man again after re-watching the spider verse one  Perfect timing Dylan 😂😂I love you❤ 25:11 😂😂😂naaaah that was cheating you didn’t show yourself scared… I know for sure you got jump-scared
"Bitten by the Love Bug" is what she means.
just press F11 when using Disney+ and then spacebar wont remove fullscreen you nob
She was bitten by the LOVE BUG, DYLAN 18:10
Yay I’m early today on a Dylan Video 🫶
1:52 same energy as   "I LOOKED AT MY UNCLE AND HE!"  "let me guess, he died?"
*we know what you did there!* Damn you, farming audience through rage-bating :D  ...and btw Team Tobey Maguire for ever <3
i mean seeing a guy sticking on the subway ceiling wouldnt faze a new yorker
love it
I am watching unicorn academic
THIS IS 100% THE BEST SPIDERMAN !!! WE LOVE ANDREW!
MY WORLDS ARE COLLIDING!!! andrew garfield and dylan, my two favorite men <33
these movies may be far from perfect  but they are MY spider-man movies
Not Dylan calling one of the best Indian actors to have ever lived "weird" and "I hope Spiderman kills him"
Bitten by a Love Bug...I think that's what she meant at 18:00
Dylan please don't watch Across the spiderverse before you watch Into the spiderverse 😅
The Nolan Batman trilogy?
with great responsibility comes great territory 🤣🤣🤣
Dylan’s war against Disney’s play button is my North Star
dylan struggling with ui is so funny to me im sorry
The fact that you haven't watched the Spiderverse movies is insane!
free palestine🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
bitten by the love bug dylan....
loving the pink shorts!!
We need part 2 asap ❤❤
I thought it was Tuesday. I am so glad Dylan is here to let us know it is in fact Monday 👏🏽
4:20 so we're just not gonna talk about this 😂
ugh i LOVE andrew’s spiderman. there is such a profound sadness in andrew as a human (he always looks like he’s in a bit of pain, even when he smiles) and it made for an impeccable portrayal. im a fairly new marvel fan but i do think they didn’t give him a third movie bc it got too dark and too real - just my guess. does anyone know why they stopped at 2?
"Oh, she's a single field?  She's not even multiple fields."  Why did I laugh so hard at this? 😭  Dylan was having a good time with this commentary.  We love to see it.
in defense of the beer lady it is New York I'm sure she has seen weirder lol...also Dylan loiing his marbles with Disney's UI never gets old
WATCH THE SECOND AMAZING SPIDERMANN
The Dylan is in real trouble in this video is when he says 'The guy looks weird. Garfield should kill him.' aaaannnd the actor passed away few years back fighting cancer. I mentally face palmed when he said that. 😮
8:22 fly away peter... fly away paul. come back peter... come back paul
Dylan not having the lights be red and blue is criminal
the amazing spiderman 2 is probably my favourite representation of spiderman, andrew is my favourite spiderman, however my fav spiderman movie is into the spiderverse
she got bitten by the love bug my dude
This man knows my schedule or something and knows when it’s my Monday 👀👀
can't believe you watched this, so excited for this video😂
the title is proof that dylan's always right
The thing about girls who like spiders is 100% correct plz dont ask how i know
23:05 STANNNNNN
please watch the amazing spiderman 2 aswell
now u have to watch the second one
Ugh thank God Dylan posted I had no idea what day it was
Thank you for acknowledging that this is the best spiderman movie <3
Dylan..... "bitten" she means bitten by the love bug 😂
6:54 dylan thats Irfan Khan. he died recently
6:14 i appreciate this joke a lot
21:48 I was expecting Dylan to bring out the bag of marbles again, not going to lie
Dylan been looking extra hot lately.... 🙄❤‍🔥
ASM is fantastic and I hope AG can play SM a lot more, especially with multiverse coming.
20:07 I can confirm this is 100% facts
The dip of quality from the first Amazing Spider-Man to the sequel is Astronomical 💯
but bestie please don't start with across the spiderverse, please watch the first one if u watch them :):)
you should watch the second amazing spider man Garfields acting is really good in that one he shows so much emotion through body language (you'll like it because there's death)
I just watched this yesterday for the same reason what are the odds
Please do the 2nd part too… I’m sure you gonna love it   If you can do “after”🥲 why not spiderman
lol hope u watch themm all
The Amazing Spider-Man series does not get enough credit. Andrew's Spider-Man was HILARIOUS
Guys I suggested this movie on the subreddit. So I am gonna take this as a sign to buy a lottery ticket 🎉
This movie commentary was the most easy A commentary of all movie commentaries ever 🏆🏆🏆
Amazing Spider-Man deserves more appreciation. I think that Amazing 3 about a post-gwen peter parker could've been one of the best spider-man films of all time, sadly it was never meant to be.
22:52 💀💀💀 Dylan........
It's Tuesday, scam artist
Now watch number 2 😢
you gotta watch unicorn academy now
watching your videos made me realise ur the master yapper this man can talk 24/7
Okay now watch the 2nd one 😅
Love Andrew Garfield but these films did not live up writing wise. First one was good but the second was meh. Also he wasn’t nerdy enough as Peter.   However I’m happy he got redemption in NWH saving MJ. Love that the writers made that full circle.
andrews spiderman movies are the best
this movie has only recently climbed up peoples' spidey movie ranks. when it first came out, majority hated it mostly cause they were too attached to tobey's. i've always loved it tho. it has been my favourite rendition of spider-man since the first time i watched it. the most comic accurate spidey out of all. the jokes! the quips! the mannerisms! the romance! i do hope they deliver if they ever make a 3rd movie. garfield is a treasure!
yes more these type of movies reactions😍😍
if I hear another easy A joke I swear-
i love how even people who've never seen these movies still know that gwen dies in the second one. it was just that much of a cultural reset.
You have to do a commentary with across the spider verse and into the spider verse bc those movies just as amazing as this one
Now you have to watch the 2nd movie there's absolutely no excuse
I just want Dylan to post on a Monday one time so everyone can lose their marbles
Oh man after like 4 years seeing yours videos I still can't miss a fucking part. Maybe is to much personal information but today University informed me I'm in half way journal to my degree. After soo many years using ur videos like a background sound i can say is a wonderful day hahahaha
Thank you! Finally someone appreciates the best Spider Man movie!
I'm watching Unicon Academy too 😂🦄
Dylan we NEED you to watch Unicorn Academy!🦄✨
I have a midterm exam tomorrow... BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT
oh hell yes
dylan you should have covered the new one becasue it's the best and also I don't want your youtube rivals to win this game
Please watch the road to el dorado!!!!
Bitten by the love bug babes 😂😂
Dylan thinks andrews the best spiderman?? i feel like i just won a bet
Yes❤
The beef that Dylan has with the spacebar pause function is on another level and I am here for it
DYLAN! ITS WHATEVER YOU CLICK LAST FOR YOUR SPACEBAR ON DISNEY PLUS! (i say because I literally do this every time im on Disney plus and I get just as irrationally angry as you lol)
Erly I love this
Each and every Monday it's like clockwork
As DJ Khaled said: ANOTHER ONE!! OMG another video and alsoooo i love this spiderman adaptation is my favorite of them all but i do just love spiderman generally ❤
gonna need to see TASM2 now
The chemistry of Emma and Andrew and the whole character arc of Andrew's spiderman along with his charm is soo good. This movie is heavily underrated. Plus, thanks Dylan for making my monday so much better. Your consistency is much appreciated!
"I've been bitten by a love bug" is the saying that Gwen was referring to. She thought that's what peter meant when he said he was bitten so she responded "so have I"
I can’t believe Andrew is older than Dylan (like actually, with Dylan’s real age 😭).
With great responsibility comes great territory 😂😂😂😂 every time
She thinks he means 'bitten by the love bug'. That is actually a line my husband said after our first date.
thank God you uploaded
There were some scenes in this one that I've never seen in the movie😭 Is Disney just giving yall the directors cut?
Dylan makes Mondays the most enjoyable day of the week😂.
I am DELIGHTED with this video
Who wants to bet he’ll never do a commentary on The Amazing Spider-Man 2? We’re still waiting on Kung Fu Panda 2 😂. He did all the After movies but can’t do a sequel for actual good movies like cmon man   Edit: But hey Dylan if ur reading this it’s ur channel ur choice whatever 👍
Dylan's constant frustration at the Disney space bar will never not be funny.
Do the seconddddddddddddddxxxdxxcxxxddsds
Okay next movie commentary will be the second one please 🙏🏼
spent this entire video laugh at every single one of your jokes   mondays truly are the best 🕺🏻
You gotta remember this is New York in a Marvel universe weird stuff happens everyday. A giant purple space alien could appear in the skyline and it be just another Tuesday to them
Dylan finally figuring out how the spacebar works on Disney+ is magical
"I've been bitten" "So have I" she means she's been bitten by a love bug, Dylan 😭😭
We'd better get Unicorn Academy
“With great responsibility comes great territory or something” lol
I don't know what to comment. So I will just leave it at this 凸( •̀_•́ )凸
You being 21 and all, you could be the next Spider-Man. You even got that hot and nerdy thing going. 😂
"Wearing his sunglasses at night, he's a VILLAIN" Or... a nollywood baddie
I'm so happy that Dylan can actually appreciate this movie
I love the different interpretations of Peter Parker all 3 main live action versions brought.
Andrew is my favorite Spider-Man he played it so well I wish that he did more then I don’t understand why people didn’t like him then but yesss this one the best Spider-Man movie
dylan i’d love to see a unicorn academy commentary please 💅😝
she was bitten by the love bug, dylan.
18:15 bitten by the love bug Dylan.  When I saw you I was also bitten 🐛
Dylan: *gigglesnort*  Also Dylan: Didn't notice little hair defying gravity.
my depressed ass needed this thank you
Is that a new shirt that I see
In my opinion: the hottest Spidercouple on screen
I didn’t even realize it was Monday until Dylan posted, Thanks Dylan!
I loved this, PLEASE do the second one if this. The amazing Spider-Man 2
Gwen was bitten by the love bug, Dylan...
I LOVE ANDREW GARFIELD SPIDERMAN AND I FREAKED OUT WHEN I SAW DYLAN'S NOTIFICATION. IT WAS SOO UNEXPECTED.
AND MY MAN THANK YOU TO MY MAN
small knives my one weakness
Being "bitten by the love bug" is an expression, Dylan.  😆
that's the closest to a Monday that we got in a while
Both these movies as messy as they are, are also wholesome af. Andrew Garfield is so dam charming and Emma Stone has amazing chemistry with him.
Reacting to TASM  Also known as: Dylan going insane not being able to pause the movie
Have you never heard of being bitten by the love bug? 😂😂 also this is my least favorite Spider-Man but I still love him 😭😅
No joke, Andrew Garfield is the best live action Spiderman.
“oh no a small knife.. my only weakness”-andrew’s spider man
Thank you Dylan for making my monday better, every single week 😍
WHAT I just watched this, crazy coincidence (maybe not statistically, big world and all)
UNICORNNNNNNN ACADEMYYYYYYY!!!!🕳️🚶🏾‍♀️
Why the sketch of the guy who killed uncle Ben looks Alex Pereira 😂😂😂
first dylan brought up danny and now kurtis?????? this is my multiverse of madness 😭😭😭
With great responsibility comes great territory✨✨
DYLANNNNN
AAAAHHH IM CREAMING HAHA I got a big ass black widow tattooet on my belly lol.
Girls who like spiders check-in:
Dylan going absolutely feral over Disney’s pause button malfunction never gets old 😂
Petition for Dylan to stream someday
Dylan- girls who like spiders only like being stalked by hot guys.
HOLY SHITTT YES
'with great responsibility comes great territory'😂😂
i think andrew garfield is the best spider man unironically and I love this movie
Id definitely tel everyone i was wit spiderman if i was mad 😭
Omg I was like he should totally watch unicorn academy 😭😭😭 yessss pleaseee doooooo!!💀
it is indeed incredibly funny to just talk about the wrong spider-man movie, thank you dylan
Petition for Dylan to react to The Amazing Spider-man 2
Actually love just binging Dylan slagging films off
I love Andrew is my fav actor
dylan unintentionally mentioning Harry Potter WITHOUT knowing that andrew's spiderman was actually the fanfiction face of Remus Lupin is HILARIOUS to me oh god
Stop cause I missed Dylan so much😩
him saying 'the garf' everytime is sending me
The two films Andrew did were so good! He is my Spiderman and him in no way home was amazing he deserved it ❤ love him as Spiderman the second film is sad af 😢 I always cry watching that film.
Dylan making an easy A joke without mentioning Cam is a crime
I know you don’t want recs but I’m early so… fnaf movie?! 😅 0:03
DYLAN YOU SON OF A BITCH I MISSED YOU
HES BACK
this is the earliest ive ever been to a video!
Dylan your opportunity for the Easy A joke was when gwen talks to flash thompson abt his tutoring
I get so exited when I see Dylan posts in makes my day
Y’all had Dylan been workin out 🤨
ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE PLS DYLAN PLS PLS PLS
I love all the other Spider-man’s dearly but Andrew Garfield will forever remain my favorite Peter Parker he’s such a soft boy and so pure hearted you can’t help but find him endearing as hell
OMG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO!!!!
Mondays are the best
i spend 10 minutes watching the commentary and 20 minutes laughing at dylan being mad at the space bar. btw best comfort youtuber
THE CONSISTENCY BROO!! ALSO ITS LIKE ALMOST MONDAY OMG OMGGG!!! 😭😭
❤❤
Another Monday another great movie commentary as always
im so in love with andrew garfield
THE WAY DYLAN REFERENCED KURTIS CONNER, LIKE OMG?? CAN WE GET A COLLAB 👀👀👀👀👀
7:01 that actor died recently in real life. Now we know it was actually Spiderman who killed him 💀
i’ve been WAITING for this commentary
Dylan's clothing and hair evolution needs to be seriously studied.
dylan it’s a little too close to monday for my liking
yes Dylan we want unicorn academy
IVE BEEEN WAITINGGGGGGGGGG FOR THIS
Fucking. FINALLY DYLAN.
I just love how consistent Dylan is...    With not uploading on a Monday
Been fighting over this since I saw it in cinemas as a kid. Glad to see its finally getting the appreciation it deserves.
What a fast week, it’s already Monday again.
HAPPY MONDAY GUYS!!!🎉🎉🎉
Please watch Amazing Spider-Man 2 gotta see you react to the second one
❤❤❤❤❤
ANDREW SPIDEY ON TOP
crazy how a few years ago this was the most hated spiderman but now it’s beloved
i clicked with a speed of light :P Dylan and Andrew in one video, phew <3
7:00 THE WAY DYLAN JUST VIOLATED IRRFAN KHAN IM CRYING ☠
Bomboclurttttttt!!!  cant lie i hate to watch this chanel but ive been consistently tuning in for the past 3/4 years
Bro is getting really close to Mondays I’m proud
We should call you DD, Daddy Dylan or DDD, Daddy Dylan's Dong
I HAVN'T EVEN WATCHED THIS YET BUT THANK U FOR MAKING A COMMENTARY ON ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME AHH DYLAN THE CAPTION IS SO REAL
OMGGGGGGG...i have been waiting for this since the dark ages!!!!!
I remember having such a huge crush on Andrew Garfield and now I have an even bigger crush on him thanks to Andrewnnaissance that’s happened recently.
IMO I love Andrew Garfield’s spiderman
How did I get so lucky to refresh and see this uploaded
Wearing only a t-shirt aged Dylan down more than that nose ring ever did
Andrew Garfield nailed the personality of being Spider-Man but the thing that bothers me the most about this franchise is they tried to make Peter Parker too cool even before he got his powers. like, he's supposed to be a huge nerd, he doesn't skateboard or have awkward meet cutes with the most attractive girl in school
The Road to El Dorado in his Netflix... 👀👀👀 I'm begging Dylan PLS 🙏❤
I've BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY FOR SO LONG
DYLAN YOU ARE SO GOD DAMN REAL FOR SAYING THIS IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE I GREW UP WITH THIS STUFF
A Dylan vid is the best bday gift!
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITHOUT DYLAN
Oooh snap! Thanks Dylan, blessing us with another video 🎉
YES!!! Andrew Garfield is an incredible Spiderman and my personal fav 💖💖
You don't understand how proud I am Dylan, you finally went shopping for new clothes, it's been years
It's always a good Monday when Dylan uploads.
MY LIFE IS COMPLETE ! DYALN LIKES MY FAVOURITE SPIDERMAN FRANCHISE AND I MEAN ITS ANDREW GARFIELD CMON
18:00 bitten by a love bug
I read the thumbnail and ngl, I was ready for Spider-Verse 😭😭😭
NO FREAKING WAY TASM????? Just when I thought I couldn't love Dylan more 🥲❤
Waiting for the unicorn academy movie commentry. Will we get it this month? I don't know. This year? I also don't know
Just on time as always<3
I have to learn not to watch your videos while I work because all I do is try not to laugh out loud 🤣
my two favorite things dylan's commentaries and andrew garfield's peter parker i'm so happy
When the universe keeps coming back together. Dylan mentioning harry potter + Andrew Garfield = Remus lupin. Ill leave now tho.
a commentary from Dylan gets ten times better if it is on Disney+ 😂
They should cast Dylan as harry in the Spider-Man movies lol
DYLAN POSTING ON MY BIRTHDAY?!?!?!? BEST BDAY GIFT 🎉
Uncle Ben’s death in this movie is so unnecessary and hilarious.
didnt even have to look at the calendar. what a wonderful monday
okay spidey
I can’t believe my favorite YouTuber is watching my favorite superhero movie!!!!
New shirt?????
LETS GOOOOO
So handsome
AND HES RIGHT!!
I was watching some videos and then youtube recommended me this and I was  like 😦😦😦😦😦
think we need a unicorn academy reaction
I can't believe Dylan is reacting to this movie😭 My favorite Spider-Man🥹
I have a 1500-long assingment that needs to be submitted tmr and I just opened my laptop but PRIORITIES!!
What a great “Monday”
"Where were we ? Oh yeah your father didnt love you 👹HAHAHA👹"                                            -Dylan 2023
I love Andrew's spidey I don't care what anyone says
always amazed by this guy's ability to never miss a movie commentary monday
Dylan never disappoint me  My favorite spiderman too😁
unicorn academy seems pretty epic ngl
Glad people are appreciating these movies more as time goes on, the hate it got when it came out was so unnecessary.
He always puts a smile on my face and instantly puts me in a good mood
As always, Dylan speaks nothing but the truth !
Andrew Garfield is simply GODLY in this film
Ayeeee I love this Spider-Man movie so much, Andrew ❤
Like "No way home" more, but Andrew was the best Spiderman, not even a question
Saying it’s kinda Harry Potter as Andrew Garfield is in it…..🤭
Andrew Garfield is MY favorite spiderman.
I'm 727th like and I like that😎
What a great Monday upload! And correct
the validation i'm feeling at this moment... me and dylan are like this 🤞 fr
I have finally been early to his video😊
I never thought I’d see Dylan react to Spider-Man and ITS MY FAVOURITE ONE
Kinda wanna watch Unicorn Academy with you tho 😂
omg i love movie commentary mondays so glad we got one again also idk why but i didnt expect this one haha
Ive done it
Andrew Garfield is and will forever be my favorite Spider-Man
he’s getting closer and closer to monday’s
4:21 Dylan giving his chair CPR lmao
dylan... you have never been more correct in your life
I’m actually a little upset that you didn’t pull a liar liar vampire on us & watch unicorn academy
Thanks for the cheer up video after the physics midterm, homie ❤️‍🩹
At this point I am convinced Dylan calls it „Movie commentary Monday“ and then doesn’t upload on Monday, intentionally.
Adding another tally for Dylan now that he has proudly announced he is pro Amazing Spider-Man.  Thanks Dylan :) ♡
andrew garfield supremacy
MALL COP!! All time favorite, can't wait for you to see it hahaha
I’m early and the notification didn’t even happen.
I don't know why but whever I see Dylan has posted a video it warms my heart
YES! I love it when you review movies I've already seen... im pumped for this. Also, Andrew is my favorite spider man.
Did anyone notice the old man in the intro and then 20yr old dylan came with his nosering or am i the only one 🤷🏼‍♀️
HE POSTED?
no doubt the best spider-man portrayal
Hi
Use this as your "give us unicorn academy" button
never knew I needed to see dylan reacting to spider man
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
This video is exactly what I needed right now ! The amazing Spider-Man is my favourite movie :)
I clicked sooo fast !!
starting this before work knowing full well i can’t finish just so i can restart the whole thing after my shift 🥰
YES YES YES
"the best spider-man movie"  SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!
Yo Dylan is that a new shirt??? Did you finally go shopping?!😅
YESSS ITS GONNA BE A GOOD DAY 😍 been waiting for this one!
Andrews Spider-Man is Underrated
The sound i just let out when i got this notification, because i adore this movie so much and andrew as spider man
this is actually the best day of my life now
TASM defenders rise
I thought you were dead Dylan
dylan in a tshirt
Before the 5 min mark!
When I got the notification that DYLAN POSTED, not only did he post but he posted a reaction to SPIDER-MAN! I jumped right to this video.
I know he does not take recs., but: It would be so cool if Dylan would watch Unicorn Academy
YESSSSS I FUCKING LOVE SPIDER-MAN Andrew Garfield is the love of my life
It feels illegal to be this early
My favorite movie not me fan girling right now I remember watching it every week I need to watch it now before Netflix takes it off  Gwen and Peter >>> Mary Jane and Peter
andrew is the best spiderman everrr
Can we just appreciate Dylan's consistent posting? Like the dedication to upload a movie commentary every single monday is just insane
Garfield's spiderman always seems to get overlooked which is such a shame. Edit: My new favorite quote from Spiderman is "with great responsibility comes great territory." It really hits deep within my soul.
OH MY GODDDDDD
Andrew Garfield really is the BEST Spiderman ♥
omfg???????
The Garf 😂

A random comment
My 2 worlds colliding
I came at 2 mins and you already have over 300 views and 50 comments. Wow Dylan I’m so proud of you and your growth
No because I’ve been saying TASM is the best Spider-Man movie for YEARS. Maybe cuz I was born in 2003 (like Dylan) but I was never a huge fan of tobeys Spider-Man. Andrews was always it for me, especially bc of Gwen too.
PERFECT TIMING! 🎉
Dylan gaslighting me into thinking it’s a Monday every time he uploads is my favorite bit and will never get old.
OMG 😭🙌
Did I read the title correct?!
it just makes sense for dylan to like andrews spidey idk
Loving the subtle sponsorship. Was it Buobly or bobbly?
YAYYYY I'M SO EXCITED TO WATCH THISSSSS 🎉🎉🎉
you're getting SO CLOSE to posting on a monday
I love this movie. Still remember watching it secretly on my school library computer for the first time ^^
The fact that you saying Andrew is the best makes me love your content even more 😊
