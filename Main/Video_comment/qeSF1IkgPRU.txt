The fact i just beat this challenge without any effort 💀
Noice video bro.
I won this challenge just by spamming all the troops in front of the townhall and spells on left side
This is probably one of the easiest and fastest challenge!
Wow. At first was scared with the infernos and towers. Follow Judo's plan and got it with the first try. Very fun especially with the Champion at the end doing her special to get all 4 Tesla Towers at the corners.
No idea what I just did, I spammed everything just by listening to you and watching my phone screen and still got 3 star haha nice!
Thank you, bro, judo, I have completed the mission.
I can't wait to use witch golem and super archers
I 3 star it difrent
I win from spam all troops 😂😂😂😂
Easyest ever
Awesome
Judo sloth is my ❤❤❤🥰🥰
That was a fun challenge!
rhe shield was so fun
Thanks Judo
Really helped
Thank u Master
Bro I have been looking for easy guides & yours have been the best so far thanks a bunch definitely subscribing
Best spam I have ever seen 😂😂
💘💘💘👍👍👍
I complete it by my own I am  only 10
niceeeeeeeeeeeeee After watching this, i did it on first try, Thanks a lot bro
Thx
easy! haha
i was like HOLD ON, and then oh, it can be done breezely hahaha thanks man
Can always rely on judo such an awesome guy .
I literally spammed everything all at once in the bottom corner and won
this is the best tutorial i always seen every season chalenge... hope i can get a goldpass i didnt experence it for my 4yrs playing the game
i just beat that without watching you and its only 1 attenpt😁
Did this on teh first try thanks to your help.
Judo our lord and savior❤
Thanks bud!!!
Mine is different though, I put 3 bats to the left, rage, then freeze, I put 3 skeletons to the right, rage, then freeze, then I put the log launcher to the very bottom of the base with 1 electro titan. Now, when the log launcher destroys the front wall of that base, I put 2 ice golems with a warden and a royal champ with 2 supr wall breakers then rage. Once I destroy the townhall, I activate the warden's ability then I put the other 3 electro titans in the corners to destroy the tesla and the skeletons.
this is the first challenge i completed yesterday, i came back after a year and decided to test my first attack there and got a 3 star
First try, thx.
Finished this challenge in 23 seconds. I used up a lot of time. Took me 6 hours. Im not kidding when i say I successfully wasted my time. Got screenshots to prove
I did it myself
anyone wanna buy clash of clans TH 13 account!!!
And actually on my first account i had more than one try but.. on my second account i only had one try and i did it!! Actually check judo's pinned comment and srcoll down 👇❤❤❤
Basic 1mins 3star
First time subscribing to your channel will support you Judo ........ Help me to purchase once 🙏🙏
wow the trick shot at the end was pretty cool! :D
The trick shot is awesome
Thanks for sharing tutorial
Thanks
I beat this one so blindly, I used a healer to activate The clan castle before electro titan the head hunters plus skeletons, before using all skeleton and bat spells to trigger the invis towers before using all wizards, ice golems, and one electro at the bottom and then launch the log launcher in the right conner as well as a titan to get the tesla as well then send everything and improvised with the spells accordingly
Nice
I finished this by dividing my troops evenly then the odds at the center, make it 3 stars at first try
Judo give me dayamon lorence Alia c
After seeing this tutorial the challenge is way too easy
Nice
Not for bad, but everyone needs to complete this without tutorial
Take love from Bangladesh
Thanks for the tutorial.
That bounce tesla was insane
Thank you!
hi judo, when do clash of clans release new scenery in new season?
Plz judo ur old introduction 🥺❣️✨
I have Got 3 Star in 1st Attack By own strategy
Got it one 1st try, thanks !
Judo is the G.O.A.T 🙌
HE JUDO SLOFT WATS YOUR CLAN NAME
Wooohh YEAH!!! 🍻
Who remeber the outside townhall 😂?
I first time clear this base without watching Your video 😉🤟
After the queens gambit challenge this was the second easiest challenge ever, supercell needs to drop more of these for us simple minded players here
thanks again mr legend
Thanks!
This was extremely helpful… or it would’ve been if I hadn’t accidentally three starred it lol. I just spammed random stuff and put electro titans around the skeleton traps and some random bat and skeleton spells to clutch up at the end. Literally nothing else, this was surprisingly easy, considering I did it first try.
First time I beat a challenge in the first try and without help and I don't even knew what almost each troop did.
This was one of the easiest challenges so far. After searching for traps, my first real attack was a triple immidiatly even though I placed the ll and the ice golems far to late, the RC in a bunch of skeleton traps and spammed all the bat+skeleton spells in the last remaining compartment because i had forgotten to use them early
Guys just spam the troops I did it like that 💀💀💀
🫶
Thanks a lot
I just spammed everything and i won
great video!keep it up!
idol judo may i join your clan?
He make it so easy for us
I finished it by using bat and skeleton spell on the single target infernos and rushing the sides
Hello sir you see the th3? ..210 exp
Sir big fan from bd
❤
Judo you are the best at making us beat these challenges what a king!!☃️😄
I love making my own solution then seeing how judo sloth does it
Great . Is worth it ! Thank you so much .
Easiest challenge ever. JUST DEPLOY EVERYTHING FROM ONE SIDE AND LET THE TROOPS DO THE WORK. TAKE HOME THE SPELLS
When does the ghost Grand Warden skin available?
I just spam everything still got the 3 star
w
Supee easy
thank you so much this helped a lot!
I deliberately restarted to nail the trick shot
I just spam everything in the corner and somehow still win
First Try thanks Judo
I beat the challenge without even placing the champion it’s easy
I won by spamming everything in one spot 😂
I am missing your intro video judo😢
Thank you judo for the guide always
Fabulous Challenge 🤍
Hi Judo, what is the best combo to put into blimp? I mean, super archer, super wizards, super minions or super bowlers?
Can you stop zooming. I can't follow the instructions. Lol
I haven’t no watt a star jars does
Thanks Judo
Spam everything and you'll easily 3 star it.
Thank you, i used code judo
Judo Rocked⚡ Opponent bases shocked🤣
😮
This was the easiest one yet
No tutorial needed!!! This is by far the easiest one ever. I just rushed it and still had loads of troops left over, too easy this one.
Sup judo
Sup joud im big subscribe😊
This one was pretty easy. I just spammed everything at the bottom and 3 starred it in 1 try. :)
If u buy the gold pass but u havent unlocked the royal champion can u still get the skin ??
Not going to lie that trick shot at the end is actually kinda cool
Easiest challenge, I just spammed troops and won 😂
Shortest video ever 😂
Nro I just Spades every troop in The middle bottom and sples on monoliths and 3*
I dont have this challenge in  my events section. Someone help
spam all to the th from 6 a clock warden ability pretty quick after - rage all of them // 3 skelli one side - 3 bats other side turn the hero’s and big units invisible in the th compartment when the monolith r still up
Judo saves the day again
How cool that she threw her shield to destroy all the teslas from 4 corners
always intresting to see how its done. I used the bats/skely and a rage to take out the entire right side and just rushed the left with my entire army overkilling the base
I sweg a fury, a frost and an invisibility🍸🍷🗿✨✨
Yo judo first time i don't need yo strat i literally just spammed units and i won
Thanks😊
YOU'RE MY FAVORITE IN TERMS OF NEW EVENTS ❤❤❤❤
When Will be new update?
Absolutely Fa-boo-lous tutorial judo
the king of tutorials 👑
Is this the upcoming halloween scenery? I waited almost 1 year and just disappointed because this scenery has same parts from different old scenery
Just the best.
Panot
I think it's not the place where I can ask questions , but guys , do I get a royal champion skin if I buy gold pass , and I don't have a royal champion yet?
thanks man
Nice making the challenge, another walk  in the park.
it is supposedly for fun so was not that difficult. I’m in th11 and I don’t know half of mechanisms of the troops but it was still easy 😁
I placed 4 electro titans on 4 teslas, got one component with 4 super wizards, rage spell & 2 invisible spells(placed on inferno side). Got the other component with rest army. Completed the challenge within 37 seconds. You can try it too.
LMAO I watched this video once, attacked and followed like 30% of your directions and then spammed the whole thing blindly and somehow it worked hahahah
This was the easiest challenge so far you can just do a builder base attack
the first thing i do in these challenges is spam all my troops and spells to just see whats going on (like where the traps are)      i won first try when i did this...
I just toticed the base design is a bat
Legend is back
Judo is basically a cheat code for us XD
I didn’t do this as smooth as you did but I still did it. Thank you
Dang glad I use code Judo every month for gold passes
Most likely the easiest challenge ive ever completed...
Thanks
i can swag that challenge, its too easy
I just did random spamming and completed this😂
I do not yet have any super troops so I cannot do this!! HOW do I get super troops?? And I do not have the log launcher yet. Headhunters?? I do not have those!!
great tutorial!!!
Thanks judo you're the best ❤
This is the easiest one I ever completed, no tutorial needed. Anyhow it’s always nice to have a guide.
Judo I  already 3 star Fa-bloous The new update with different location
judo is like teaching us because its like problem and solution
This is always so helpful, thank you please never stop
Judo u our problem solver in every event ..❤
This was so cool I wait he’d the first 10 seconds and then did it myself first try
Been supporting you for a few months now judo! Great vid!
Finally a set where the Royal Champion has the best skin
Thank You Judo for putting all your time and effort into these videos and thanks for helping us with all of these challenges it helps alot❤❤❤❤❤
I literally just let all my troops go and winged it.  Pretty simple base.  I got 3 stars first try
hola judo like your  conten ❤❤
This challenge is too easy
I'm here to say I made it from the first time without watching the video thanks man you learned me a lot
I was able to do it in 32 seconds can’t get it any faster
always the best thxs judo.
In war who will win if opponent    has full star and our also full star ? I want to know bro plz
Thanks for the guide. 3 stars on the first try.
I just spammed both sides and prayed, it worked
Anyway i beat it just spamming all the troops on the top left
Judo bro take rest... tutorial video after playing tournament whole night...🔥💙
I just deployed all troops at once and 3 stared it but still wanted to see the guide
You just earned my use of your creator code bro. I been watching your videos for a little while now.  played clash of clans a very long time since 2013. Just recently came back. You still keep clash fun, exciting, and cool. Things sure have become wild these days in game. Good job with your channel, it's excellent, and keep up the good work.
Hah, is it so easy even for me)
Seems easier than usual, but it's good they included some supertroops.
This one was pretty easy. I was just trying to get the elixir and threw everything in the middle from below to get the TH and got the 3 stars
Best advice for Clash Of Clan
I played the Challenge 3 times coz Im amazed with the last Shot from Royal Champion. So nice.
I not expect the RC ultimate at the end😮...great tutorial 👍
This is only challenge I manage to 3 star without any help ( I just spammed the troop)
tbh i did this first try without guide😱😶😠🦂😔🤫😠😱😶😱😡🤭🦂🤤🤪🤤🤔
This was actually a fun challenge, I guessed deployed with some thought and got a 3 star pretty surprisingly, I redid the challenge and yup every time I replicated the deployments it’d work. I did it nothing like judo but really shows if you actually try to figure out these challenges by yourself you’ll have way more fun. Judo though is a great time saver especially when it’s a good magic item.
I'm waiting good skins and scenese until dark ages (((
I got scared when i saw the challenge and when i sww it said boo
love from bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 bro
i love how the strategy is: drop everything here
I like how they design the challenge to look like a skull with a bat for a face.
Can somebody tell me what the new Halloween obstacle is?
I just spam down it and this time it worked 😂
failed at the headhunter part but the electro titan walk cleared it for me thanks judo ❤
So easy
I did it on my own
Lol me i already did it in one try without watching this😎😎
waiting for royal ghost to complete the goblins map
Watching that shield go around was really fun, I did it again just to watch the shield go round.
I did it before seeing this for the first time lol
Simple
Thank you for the tutorial ❤ judo and love your videos ❤
I have finished the base with in 50 sec bro
Hello Judo sloth sir...please make video about changing gmail in clash of clans account.. i cant receive OTP code for changing gmail..please help us ......thankyou
Sumit 007 did it to a easy way 😮‍💨
He really makes the hard challenges into easy one 😂
Judo sloth, the man with 0 lovers  ❤😂
The trick shot😂🔥
i dropped everything at the far right and got 3 star 🤣
Wow this is so simple and yet I thought it was hard😢 but once again thanks judo
Please judo send me gold pass
The final shot was really good tho
I didn't even watch the whole video and started spamming and accidentally got 3 star😅😅
Spam ez, thnks for the tutorial sir
someone already got the prizes from the galaxy superverse  in game i won but i did not get any?
Thank you Yudo!! Btw I’m th14 recently should I rush to 15 and if so what should I focus on, additionally I’m kind of struggling with multi phase attacks any tips and armies I might be able to use? If you guys could post link that would be great! 🎉
This was the first challenge I 3 starred in my own crude way without any tutorials. But I decided to check Judo’s method anyway. I realise now I need to follow his method just to experience that Champion trick shot at the end! 😂
Hahaha loved this one especially the end 😂👌 you prob won't read this, but you are who I go to for challenges and I thank you for saving my time good sir! In return, I always support you in game! Not important but just know you have my sword (: best of luck in becoming a superstar!!
Plz😢com back of clash of clen 😅
Such an easy challenge I did first try without any tutorial they really made those new challenges easier than like the cyberpunk season ones...
Appreciate the content .. but on this raid I didn't need any special attack just placed the troops in center and bam 3 star
Cool my Friend Judo Now I Have Done With 💯%👉3 STAR Attack.
Brooo
Nah this challenge is the most easiest challenge of all time I just spam the troop and hero and I win 😂😂

Thank you judo! ❤❤❤
Bro i just spammed everything in the like nothing but i was shocked that three electro titans were left and three star the base 😯

Sueprb...... In one go... I got 3 stars... Thanks for sharing such a wonerfull attack.... 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
Damm LOVE THAT SKIN!!! and as always ty for your help Judo ❤️ you're a life saver for these challenges
Judo Bro your the best ❤ love from my bottom of my heart 💜 lots of love bro
Hi

It took less than a minute to finish🎉 Thanks my friend😅😅
Just bought the Gold pass with Code Judo  Clash of Clans Guru
The challenge IS relly ezy i get 3 stars in first try without tutorial 😅
Love your videos judo keep up the great work
Awesome 🎉 thank you!!! Put your creator code in!!!
I highly doubt if they can release better skins ever
best tutorial send everything in any side and you win trust me try this
I just spammed my troops and 3 starred it 😂 by far the easiest challenge among all the challenges of this type
I dont think is hard at all I just spammed everything middle and it worked 😂
I just spammed all troops and some how won the challenge
Nice and easy. And I didn’t realise content creators got the gold pass at least 4 days before everyone else ?  Showing nearly 34 days remaining here
I got it on the first try on my accounts, so I came to check your methods if they were different from mine, and they were.
I only spam the troops😂 and 3 star it
Who just deployed all at a time
Judo, it's very nice looking at the trick shot of RC at 4 teslas
i was trying to do that 10 times and win but after few hours i saw this in almost 1 minute
Judo is fast than coc🤣
Thanks judo this one was fun and easy even for me 🦇💀🦇
Damn the royal champion ability is so satisfying at the end 🫠
I am looking for loyal active players for a relatively new clan. Would be great if anyone is interested, currently 30 players all english speaking no dead weight. Most are returning veterans. Cheers ❤
Did it third try without a tutorial... I'm finally getting good
This one was really easy imo..i managed to 3 star without watching judo.... But these tutorials are much appreciated...thanks judo
Any event ! We straight go to judo vdo ❤ best teacher
Thank you so much brother.....
Tru
Anyone can buy goldpass for me?i cant buy it in mu country 😭
THANK YOU SO MUCH 🤣🤣
This one is easy with only one chiray
I miss the magic royal champion, when can I get her?😂
Judo can you friend me clash of clans I used your code "Judo" If you answer this thanks
In my case i just spammee every thing in the middle n somehow won 😂
Hello it’s me from the stream yesterday, I’m a little late on the first hour. Love your content!
I'm in th 10 but somehow I 3 star in one play through 😂😂
I just spammed in one spot and won somehow
The rc skin was marked legendary when it came out, i bought it and now its gold, why is that?
Hi judo can u give me gold pass❤❤
maka
Coming after completing the challenge 😅
1st up i opened both compartments with the wall breakers, grand warden with healers to take out a few def, 1 ice golem to each side & the rest spread out the troops on either side of the base skeleton spells one side bat spells on the other side, log cart to the right with grand warden & invisible spells to the sides where troops are then rage when they are near the town hall. easy 3 star.
guys why does the rc change from legendary to gold
It's a habit for me now ... once every season begins I'll purchase the golden Pass supporting Judo and come here to check the solution for the challenge and get the 3 stars easily ❤❤❤...
i defeated the challenge without help now watching what you suggest but idk kinda got the 3 star on 1st try this one aint that difficult.
This Royal Champion skin is probably the most detailed and my personal favorite now. If you have played Prince of Persia Warrior Within upto the point when the prince transforms using the MASK OF THE WRAITH, she literally looks like that! ❤
Bro I will recreate this video i will mention you too please see and comment on the video
I'm from Vietnam and I found this video very useful😊
I just random bs go this time and still able to 3 star, It was so easier than the last chess king challenge
Thanks Judo, I was strugling to 3 star the base but you saved the day! Love your videos, Judo.
Thank you. Ima noob so ya. Thanks a lot
Easily 3Stars ❤ Thanks Judo❤ LOVELOTS FROM😊 PHILIPPINES

Easiest challenge
This is one of the few challenges that I finished without Judo's help. Still appreciate your hardwork ❤
How will we be able to get the other ghost skins other than the one part of the Gold pass? I really like the other skins
I just couldn't resist buying the Gold Pass even though I wasn't planning to, but that skin is a big W. So, I instantly bought it.
When you get in the 1 minute a 3 star without a tutorial
This season is the best season ever ❤️🔥
