hi, i know you may have not been expecting this but  Jesus loves you and he died for you so that you and I may have eternal life, the thing is that no matter how good we may think we are,we are all sinners that deserve an eternal punishment cause we sinned against an eternal God. But Jesus Christ came into this world  as a man to take the punishment that  you and I supposed to take. To  receive God's gift of eternal life you have to believe in he who he says he is, not just a good man, a great teacher or a big prophet but the way the truth and the life and you must  confess with your mouth that he is lord  come to him the way you are and let him change you, I am not here to force any religion. If you would like to receive him you can pray this prayer ( remember it is not a prayer that saves you but your faith in Jesus)   Jesus i accept you today as my lord and personal saviour  i believe you died and rose again, i choose to forsake the world to follow you  change my heart and make me who you want me to be  in Jesus name i pray amen     Thank a lot for reading and for your patience, have a wonderful day

British rap suxx … that song w/ kid laroi annoyed me so much I had to visit this garbage.  I’ve never been so annoyed with an accent, in my life.  I’ve never wanted to punch someone in the face so hard ever, but I’m afraid if I did, he’d sound even worse than he does now…  Garbage rapper, leave rap to Americans, go drink tea or something

Didn't know central cee is a real Madrid fan so good❤
what
At first I was a little disappointed as always with Central Cee 😅 and the more you listen the better and I think it's the first time that someone who was little becomes a famous guy and talks about this subject which denounces a capitalist society.  So just for that keep it up CEE
Central Cee never disappoints, he knows how to choose the perfect beat.
Yo cench what u doing in Egham? You local yeah ? Shout me AMOFFICIAL23

THE BELLINGHAM SHIRT HELP-

Bars man 🔥I shoot/direct music videos myself and only criticism I got With CC is his lip movement/action. Looks as if he's mumbling. It would definitely grab the viewer even more if I could see his mouth rapping the bars (more emphasis on the lips) but other than that hardest UK rapper man
ああ、なんて素晴らしくて完璧なんだろう
Prr pr 🔥

I own a blue 2008 Toyota Yaris, "Went from a Toyota Yaris to a Urus" that line hits different🔥🔥

Not for me, but I appreciate the fact that you can hear the lyrics, which are very well put together, and it's not full of bad language/violence. I'm not prudish about swearing in any way - the use of the f word (etc.,) is perfectly acceptable for certain situations. Also, I get a positive vibe. 👍👍😘😘
Overrated,your good but not main stream good. I can't bump this shit in my car.
cool man👍👍👍👍
i heard hes guyanese 🇬🇾!

Dearest Cee,  The ink feels heavy on my fingertips, like the weight of unspoken words pressing down on my heart. This letter, a vessel for both sorrow and solace, stands as a testament to the journey we shared, now reaching its bittersweet end.  Saying goodbye to you, even in thought, tears at the very fabric of my being. Our laughter, once woven into the tapestry of days, now hangs like tattered threads, echoing with the memory of joy. The warmth of your presence, a sunbeam I used to bask in, chills me now with the absence of its light.  But even in the face of this aching departure, gratitude blossoms. Thank you for the stardust you sprinkled on my life, for the dreams we danced under the same moon, for the secrets whispered in the hush of twilight. You were my confidante, my partner in adventure, the melody that harmonized with my soul.  Our paths, like rivers converging and then diverging, now take us to different horizons. Though the pain of separation stings, I respect the whispers of our individual stories, the chapters yet to be written. To hold onto what has been, when the tide pulls us forward, would be to deny the very essence of our growth.  So, I release you, Cee, with a bittersweet blessing. May your laughter ring out wherever you roam, your dreams paint the sky with vibrant hues, and your spirit find solace in the embrace of new dawns. And within the tapestry of memories, cherish the threads of joy we wove together, for they will forever whisper your name in the chambers of my heart.  This isn't a finality, but a transformation. The love we shared, though taking a different form, remains an ember glowing within me. It will fuel my journey, a reminder of the light we found in each other.  Fare thee well, my dearest Cee. May your path be illuminated, your heart brim with wonder, and your soul find peace in the unfolding tapestry of your life.  With love and bittersweet acceptance,   You have ruined my life

Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God and your souls. Jesus lived, died and rose again to save us.

I’m mad he sold out to Columbia records. It would’ve been mad respect if he didn’t, but now he’s just sold his soul to the devil. So mad respect is gone. What a shame. He should’ve stood strong on his own.

Still driving my Toyota Yaris 🚗
Letra:  “ Noites Frias”🎵     Refrão:  Nas noites frias preocuro o conforto dessas melodias Ela disse que está  chegando o meus dia  Eu amo aquilo o que me tornei se for pra voltar no tempo Te juro que não mudo nada ...   Estrofe:  Manos que se afastaram  de mim eu quero que continuem  afastados eu estou atrás de dinheiro, e não em ter uma mulher ao meu lado fiz muitas coisas erradas Mas mesmo assim Deus tá ao meu lado Amei e ajudei  muitas pessoas erradas ...  Muitos pensamentos eu tenho medo  que a minha mente possa explodir O sonho desde miúdo é  sair da merda e evoluir  Os que julgaram e me humilharam sei que um dia eles vão  plaudir a verdade é que eu quero sumir...  p'ra bem longe ...  Refrão:  2x  Nas noites frias preocuro o conforto dessas melodias ela disse que está  chegando o meus dia  eu amo aquilo o que me tornei se for pra voltar no tempo,  Te juro que não mudo nada ...  🌇📀Ouça agora a minha Ep  “ Outra Metade”  Toca no link:  https://youtu.be/hC3X1DTAih4?si=0QV9zQiOJgwWRUnv

I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.

Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing.

I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Cat dancing has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.

Você é o cara Cee🔥
Yaris to Urus
So clean
Reff du jeans svp à 0:44
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Why did the start sounding like a call of duty operator

He spelled Entrepreneur wrong, but fire
Merry Christmas. May I share with you the Gospel? If u wanna be saved today read this. The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23. And to go to heaven we need to be perfect Revelation 21:27. But God says we can't earn our salvation because we aren't perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  We simply believe on Jesus Christ's   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2 Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15: 1- 4. And it's only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47. And from this we know Jesus alone saved us from our sins  not by our works as Ephesians shows but by Grace through Faith in Him. And we can know we are saved through 1 John 5:12-13. Have a good day.
Maximo respeito 👍

I am a 69 year old man from Alabama, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Alligators played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honour for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powertul, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined Alabama cults who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/its life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical african war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Alabama is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 Alabama tribes/10 Alabama tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece.
Shocking

🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
In Da Hood    [Intro]  I fart in da hood.  I fart in da hood.  I fart in da hood.    [Verse 1]  Sadness and solitude keep on k…lling my stormy mood.  Go crazy. Heavy metal is tasty. Enjoy my boggy hood.  For real I steal everybody’s loot. Vampires shun fire  And keep on jogging aloof. Skunks chase rats in the rotting hood.  Business really sucks if you have no fitness and bucks.  So you lose if you get bruised. You don’t fit these blocks.  Everything really sucks. Crazy corrupted cops release these f…cked-up thugs.  Bums gobble gutted bugs. Schools are underfunded. Rocks  Cave in. Ravens like hunting dogs. No time to banter. Ducks  Become lame playing the game. Vile slander sucks.  Broken fates galore. Local mates ignore books.  Crooks don’t wanna masticate lore. Destiny fades. Bawl  And cuss. Trust turns into dust. I’ve been through lust  And rusty melancholy. Grab melons and flee the city  That is sh…tty. Squeeze lemons for free.    [Chorus]  Farting in the hood.  Farting in the hood.  Farting in the hood-hood-hood-hood…    [Verse 2]  Dragons become lackadaisical and a little lazy. Dill  Burn. Smoke makes me go crazy. Drill  Walls and Jay Z’s mill. Then I get swayze. K...ll  Time. Call me Vile. I spill the beans and Pepsi. Chill  And copy Snoop Dogg. I’m in the mood. Shock  Local mooks. Mock loco dudes. Rock  Is my strong suit. Lock your doors, wh…res.  Stop your chores and hide because I’m gonna fight  Your love army. Stop running. Alright.  Lust blows my mind. Flight’s delayed.  I-I’m ready to mate. Screw hate. I’m cool and okay.    [Chorus]  Farting in the hood.  Farting in the hood.  Farting in the hood-hood-hood-hood…    [Verse 3]  Listen to Metallica-tallica and Coolio’s valley-valley. Scar  After scar. I’m not a star. I just dally. Come  Closer to the loathsome edge. Memories often itch.  Count my rusty coppers. Glitch stole my bike.  I lost my mind. I’m gonna switch off the radio.  They woo. Don’t play me. Grow pale in Sunnydale  When I read Buffy’s mail. Everybody’s in jail.  Monsters burn libraries. No time for hype and peace.  I can’t sit tight and tease demons of patience.  I get audacious to fight the Gs who wanna see me in plight. Bees  Keep on biting knees. Don’t freak me out!  Gas is leaking now. I stand in need of crowds.  But people are gonna beat me now.  I give ‘em poison. So they don’t make noise in  The room. Boyz N The Hood wanna live in a posher hood.  They wanna post some food and forget about the loathsome nook.    [Chorus]  Farting in the hood.  Farting in the hood.  Farting in the hood-hood-hood-hood…    [Outro]  No smoking! No farting!  No smoking! No farting!  Do you understand me?  Do you understand me?  Do you understand me?    © NORFUM 2023.

Cench is so calm with LGBTQ its so refreshing to see
straight pop trap. Cee fiending for the green card
"Went from Toyota Yaris to Urus" that bar is lethal and he pulled up with both whips too.

Lyrics:    you know what? The trap still runnin', it's never turnin' off Different product, same hustle mentality The only difference is You pay taxes on it and feds can't kick off your door (We put the trap in entrepreneur)  [Verse 1: Central Cee] We was flyin' up O with white, we was buildin' lines, now it's clothing lines I sell tees and my darg sell T's as well, but his ain't got no design (One—) One-eighty for the tracksuit, go somewhere else if it's overpriced New genеration don't know how to trap 'cause they all getting high off thеir own supply (Trap—) Trap house in the woods where the bando's haunted, it's supernatural, poltergeist Witnessed things that I wish that I didn't, like crackheads overdose then die Bad B's curvin' the kid back then when I weren't so lit, I was broke them times Bitch, would you ride on the back of a bus? What 'bout on the front of a stolen bike? Soho pitchin' coke to the gay men, I'll serve anyone, I got a open mind No complaints when it comes to the customer service, I pick up the phone polite See man fall in love with the white, Billie Eilish, 'cause they got ocean eyes Set up a shop, then it's open twenty-four hours, we don't have a closin' time  Chorus: Central Cee] (We put the—) We put the trap in the entrepreneur All of the time we spent in the field, woulda thought I got me a Ballon d'Or I'm stackin', not droppin' a bag in Dior (Went from a—) Went from a Toyota Yaris to Urus, I still got the same work rate as before (Work rate as before) Two years that I ain't been home, seven-hundred and thirty days on tour  [Verse 2: Central Cee] It was Nokia ringtones, pickin' up phones No private calls, now it's microphones I think that I got bipolar disorder, the way I'm going through highs and lows (In—) Insta' full up with IG models and back in the day, I would Skype these hoes My girl try hack my iCloud, when I logged in, gotta hide my code Tryna get in through face recognition when I was asleep and my eyes were closed, huh If she ain't got nothin' to hide, might make her my wife, yeah, I might propose How many lies got told? Don't believe in the hype, it's false Bro died, he was still in his teens The chance is slim of me dyin' old I won't lie, it's me or them (Or them) Slime shit, I'ma wipe his nose Unbankin' packs and touches faeces, I was OT, you would find it gross Now it's five-star hotels, Michelin-star dinin', I might rise a toast New generation would die for clout They'll do anything for a viral post  Chorus: Central Cee] (We put the—) We put the trap in the entrepreneur All of the time we spent in the field, woulda thought I got me a Ballon d'Or I'm stackin', not droppin' a bag in Dior (Went from a—) Went from a Toyota Yaris to Urus, I still got the same work rate as before (Work rate as before) Two years that I ain't been home, seven-hundred and thirty days on tour

Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  The Euphrates river is drying up and shaping like the Omega symbol. Jesus said he’s the Alpha and the Omega  Revelation 16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
More clear than any UK rapper🔥

x_mass trap still tuning
Just another crap boasty song, the new generation is actually fucked up, what about the older generation like Michael Jackson and Annie Lennox who actually did good for the world with charity and heart and made the most beautiful songs, including political ones, the young people don't see this and because of this, they're failing at what they do, as well as making a mockery of our Musical Union, this is why the world needs to act to stop this nonsense, to stop boastyness, people going to Instagram and showing off their wealth, they have to understand that change and nothing but change will only work, with force
U will never fall off
hey doubleC, im doubleG also letrick and yesterday my phone died and all i have left is my laptop, if you fell like santa this year @letrickfura is my revo, all i want is an iphone 15 pink, ty and merry x-mas 2C

Could’ve been better
Hi all. I hope you are doing well. I would like to share the good news with you. There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything, and he is Sovereign over everything. God has appointed his only Son to judge the living and the dead. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as lying, stealing, lusting, anger, and pride. God is Holy, Just, and Impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that his people deserved and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness.

The trap still running, it's never turnin' off Different product, same hustle mentality The only difference is you pay taxes on it and feds can't kick off your door (We put the trap in entrepreneur)  [Verse 1: Central Cee] We was flyin' up O with white We was buildin' lines, now it's clothing lines I sell tees and my darg sell T's as well, but his ain't got no design One-one-eighty for the tracksuit, go somewhere else if it's overpriced New genеration don't know how to trap 'cause they all getting high off thеir own supply Trap-trap house in the woods where the bando's haunted, it's supernatural, poltergeist Witnessed things that I wish that I didn't, like crackheads overdose then die Bad B's curvin' the kid back then when I weren't so lit, I was broke them times Bitch-bitch, would you ride on the back of a bus? What about on the front of a stolen bike? Soho pitchin' coke to the gay men, I'll serve anyone, I got open mind No complaints when it comes to the customer service, I pick up the phone polite See man fall in love with the white, Billie Eilish, 'cause they got ocean eyes Set up a shop, then it's open twenty-four hours, we don't have a closin' time

Song is a banger just like the Bellingham goal against Barcelona
I just want to say that Jesus loves all of you. I used to be agnostic and I was always questioning about the purpose of life and how we are here and I always wondered if there was a God or not. Getting money is good but at the end of the day, it is not the purpose of life. Money is temporary, chasing after money, fame, women, etc is unfufilling. But I can tell you Jesus is the way and he is the truth because he super naturally encountered me and it changed me and my heart from that day forever. It was the most joyful and at peace that I have ever felt in my entire life. I can tell you that Jesus can do the same for you and he can help you through anything you are facing now. Jesus is the one that can fufill your true purpose in life. Following Jesus is not about a religion but a relationship with him. Life is temporary and so is everything we chase on it but what is eternal, is your eternal life in heaven with Jesus. I hope you seek the truth and seek a relationship with Jesus because he loves you and he died for you on the cross so you don't have to suffer for eternity. God bless you all

5 % each you think that’s low but I’m making big money if you wanna fly this plane then you need to follow the wave not talking rap talking investing, you want more then that I’ll say good day policy is not good but I need one so I keep it 💯 from china too United States to where they pull trigger’s we still busting but keeping it low show up with a necklace or watch and I’ll pay extra you think it’s funny but we’ll end up in a hotel not partying but making money movement’s call me state of mind cause I’m state too state mind over matter I’m still pushing no matter what I don’t got a clock cause I’m still flying like a bird pass the whistle cause he whistled now we know you’re business no matter where you are I’ll get it done they say so, I pay more then you’re housekeeper they still see the steel 24/7 I’m still chilling well I’m thinking where the plane will be next, music the way it’ll be I went from serving coke to guns too serving music they wanna be higher in game but don’t see 5% in each product they want you’re soul and profile so they can make a clone so I keep 100% that I’ll be nice for the night copy my ways and it’ll be the microphone no need to fall down we still out here making beats like the heat in the streets hold you’res trees cause she’s on her knees saying for half of you’re supply’s I went from no flow too making verse’s in 2 years. It’s like controlling and managing

La razón por la que tiene éxito Central Cee es porque su música es auténtica. Construyó una base de fans leales basándose en la coherencia y sin tratar de sonar como todos los artistas. Rezo para que algún día mi música pueda llegar a masas como Central Cee. ¡Él es mi mayor inspiración!
