1:23 Roman Reigns Laugh is National Treasure 🤩
The mic went into business fot itself
1:24😂😂
1:18😂😂😆
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE MIC TO WORK😂😂😂😂😂
Ridge Holland's reaction is funny
1:13 Roman: what you say? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This segment was pure comedy
Was Sheamus' mic not working a part of the script? I actually have no idea if it is or not.
0:52 i don't know wat is Going on here but I totally love How Roman just turns around like that with a mad look on his face..
1:19 😂😂🤣🤣
1:05 Brought You Here to This Video 😂

a group made of british and irish  thanks to the great british bulldog who showed people from the UK could make it to wwe and ridge when he said game sounded like davey
lets see them try that on monday with 4 generations of samoans surrounding the ring
Making Roman a heel was the best move for wwe
Sheamus Is True Legand And 100% a Future HOF
Roman will never ever beat Drew without backup
WE THE ONES
Comical to see the "Fella" Sheamus not getting his mic to work lol... Fella
As someone that was at the show in Indianapolis, I thought that Heyman was going to make a joke about the Colts firing their coach earlier that week
Acknowledge The Tribal Chief and The Bloodline 💙👑👆🏽
WHERE IS SAMI
But why is Solo without a title? I thought he won the North American Championship
Don't mass with my Bloodline they will get you
😂😂😂😂, that was hell funny, that Roman smile, 😂😂😂
Being disabled of Mike got me....
Bloodline should loose in wargames that could setup a Sheamus or Holland vs Roman on next paperview then have Roman win that will buy time til WrestleMania to face the rock
Where is sami?
Better to say a War .
Looking forward to the Rumble.
1:40-1:45 LOL!
WWE is milking those “we the ones t-shirts
Roman Reigns king of king 👑👑👑
WARRRRRRGAMESSSSS
The Warring Brutes...👊🏼⚔🍀👊🏼
the fact the mic was still messin up as he was entering the ring 😭😭😭
Sheamus fella 💪💪💪
Sami Zayn's prank?????😂😂😂😂😂
Roman king
Roman's laugh
Fight night at survivor series waaaaaaar games babyyyyyyyyyyy
First time long time roman lounging
Edge batista.kkkk.
Wwe now goes boring, same story main event last two years.
Smackdown is one fire
My age is 15 I am 2016 to shemus fan😼
Everyone is talking about sheamus mic part  But the more hilarious part for me is 2:06 Roman reaction when drew theme song started to play
Many wrestler who had double championship fought twice in a night. Eg.Seth rollin, Jericho even Becky lynch . so why cant Roman. Why so much protection. Let one championship challenged by raw contender and another from smackdown. I was expecting such long before but have not witness untill now. Instead often he is not even defending either title. Its been couple of month iam skipping the show and just reading about the match. Glad i missed. Nothing new.
Wow
Where is Sami ?
He was about to acknowledge them
Just another fantastic mic burn by Roman 🔥
Imagine every time Sheamus swore the mic goes off🤣🤣😭
sick scripted fighter keeping on dreaming
Roman his great man
Randy Orton and Roman Reigns are the only pro wrestlers that look good with two titles
1:24😂😂😂
Where is Sami Zayn in the bloodline?
Honestly if anyone deserves to dethrone Roman one day it's Drew💯✊
Ali
my favourite now is drew
😂😂😂😂😂Roman
At least make sure u have a proper mic lol
BRAWLING BRUTES × DREW MCINTYRE!!! 😍💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪⚔️
Roman ❤️❤️
Plz chairman let's finish this change titles plz roman is not good enough to be a double champ
Bloodline at War Games let’s go 🙌
this shtick is so old and dull.... makes me just turn the channel when this bs comes on
Roman laughing kinda like Seth 😂😂😂
As Roman pushes sikoa to go at Drew 🤣🤣
Remember Heel Sheamus Vs Face Roman Reigns Now It’s Heel Roman Reigns Vs Face Sheamus
initially when smackdown became live, Shane McMahon used to brag about smackdown being the A show by showing fake ratings. But Now, Roman and co. has actually made Smackdown the A show. Raw is no way near Smackdown now.
where's sami ?
Hell yeah!!!! Bring it on !!!!
My Drew McIntyre😍😍
My Drew McIntyre😍😍
I'm in LOVE with WWE 😍 😂
Roman has certainly learned to think on his feet by taking an equipment issue like a mic not working and cutting a quick promo with it.
The fan that shouted we can't here you was hilarious
The bloodline
Nepotism is lowly becoming a growing concern for me.
best promo of Roman every time he's a savage 🤣😂
Solo and Roman will be dead soon 🤣🤣.Sheamus is the real deal not the bloodline puppies
Mclntyre super nice start
This makes. No sense if Sheamus couldnt defeat Gunther how tf u gonna tell me that he gonna beat Reigns 😂
0:51 how did pete Dunne fit all his hair in tht small hat 💀
After long it was fun watching WWE as was in the shield era 2014
kinda upset the hurt business wasn’t around long enough to do war games with the bloodline, they could of added omos. but the brawling brutes and. drew is just as good.
@1:27 Roman suddenly goes all Italian
ROMAN IS ALL TIME LEGEND AND MY FVT😏😘
they need 1 more person to take out Paul heyman
The dead crowd ruined an otherwise great segment
Whoever was working on sheamus’s mic is probably future endeavoured
Wat happend  to sami
foll hayemon
Where is Sami Zayne? Sorry Sami Uso?
Where is Samy Uso?
legend says they're still fighting
Where we get the full segment of this caos?
Sikoa didn't laugh
1:24 that laugh omg 😂😂 roman i acknowledge your laugh
1:23
War Games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Roman kick 😮😮😮
WWE for the love of God make longer videos when you upload this stuff please 🙏🏾
I acknowledge the bloodline because they are the one ☝️
Would be more interesting to see a 3MB reunion and for them to take on The Bloodline. Jinder Mahal is already in Smackdown. Now it's only for Heath Slater to come back to Smackdown.
Hahaha u can't even get the mic to work😂
That's war is phenomenal and i hope Samy also join and another one shemus side 5 on 5 at main event servivor series
War games 🔥
Where is sami
Where was Sami?
Head of the table roman reigns super 👌
We need Canadians like heatman back too 😂
UK people try ruin the USA again 😂
wwewasidchampiowwe
The bloodline took out sheamus last time so he can get married and enjoy some nights 😎. Ucey move by the bloodline
BakribPraiserAllfromvOttar4 Allbarreinplate3allfrom1200earsAllareinnaksalatieelsein. All can. get in milatary
What was the end I am searching from 3 days🤔
They didn't have to do Sheamus like that with the messed up mic.

Hi
Solo needs that Intercontinental title
Michael Cole: and Roman Reigns with a boot to Drew McIntyre. i like how Drew McIntyre fell to the ground after the boot to the face from Roman Reigns it was funny. at      2:38 seconds instead of a Superman punch Roman Reigns just hit Drew with [a Superman Boot] to his Jaw. hahahahahahha hehehehe.🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Love you roman 😍😘
since triple wants the world titles too be separated again without roman being pinned why not just make it where roman reigns can relinquish one of the titles
So they're gonna put Mcintyre through this again? He deserves better.
ROMAN IS A POS USELESS SAMOAN WHOS WHOLE FAMILY IS A JOKE
Roman Reigns laughing Seth Rollins style. I want to see Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins team up again.
When Roman Reigns is shield members he is always angry and shouting but I never see Roman Reigns this type of laughing.
When Roman Reigns was face he is some amazing matches with Aj style, Bray Wyatt (inside Hell in a cell), Bobby Lashey, Brock Lesnar first match, Brun strowman (ambulance match), etc.
Where's Sami?
End the bloodline administrative
this bloodline thing is really getting boring looks like those who wanna see them is just as lame
The carelessness on bloodline face ☝🏾
I love that tshirt which Roman is wearing
Every episode of smack down is just this guy talking about how good his family is hahaha
WAR GAMES, WAR GAMES, WAR GAMES. it's obvious, we found our second Survivor series Wargames match...
Roman ♥️♥️♥️
Drew McIntyre 🥇💪💕
I must confess I've been nagging Drew and Sheamus on their Instagram and Facebook to repair their old friendship and form their own tribe to take down the bloodline and it's great to see it happen ❤️
Is.roman like.razor ramon
Shemus is back after the wedding
Cheating , Coward Cunning Worthless & Useless Universal Champion " FRAUD LINE " Roman Reigns Now Facing Problem , Lose Them Titles  .  Coming Soon . Await & See .
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😂😂😂😂😂
I went to this it was awesome
Tamina should be female bloodline divison🎉
hello.romsn.reings.you.stop.i.am.all.best.vews.all.only.one.king.alok.
আপনি এমনকি মাইকও কাজ করতে  পারেন না
We The ones 🖕🖕🖕
Butch💪🔥
Yrr ab bahut roman ka rona ho gaya... Now it's boring🥱... We want a new champ😎
Roman is love💛
2:08 What was that noise from Wade when Drew came out? 😂😂
Happy time ☺️👍
Feels like an old Nitro ending.
His mike sounds funny
Guess roman's laugh is in league with kawhi's🤣
Bring Imperium in to this and you'll get the ultimate war. 😊
Where the hell was Sami? 🤔
Reings vs Mcintyre vs Sheamus for the Title and The fact that reings didnt just chose to retreat was amazing
Why does Drew always have to be in the title picture just get him off my screen.
Who else is sick of the bloodline?
This is going to be a good survivor series match
RK BRO rocks over The USOs and capture WWE Raw Tag Team Championship from The USOs
I can See a Triple threat match for the Undisputed Title with Sheamus, vs Drew vs Roman, OR a fatal 4 way if Karrion Kross was added..
Did anyone see the bit where mcintyre went to hit an uso but hit Holland instead that was badly timed
where are zayan?
1:24 I ACKNOWLEDGE that LauGh but not RoMan 🤣🤣🤣
I saw the drew impact
In think bloodline vs drew, Sheamus, riddle and the brawling brudes
It's gonna be Team Bloodline vs Team WWE  Roman , Jimmy, Jey, Sami, Solo                 vs  Sheamus, Butch, Ridge, Drew, Kevin Owens. WarGames match.. I'm on for it..
🤬💖
What Happened to Sami Zayn?
Someone please dethrone roman already i am really frustrated now. at this point may it be sheamus or drew idc just put the guy down
Where was Samy?!  :(
he really tries to be seth with that laugh
It's official: Roman Reigns vs The Mic at Extreme Rules for the Universal Title. 🔥
*Cheat Champion ever Roman* 🤮
Props to Roman for resolving that botched mic really well.
I acknowledge  the bloodline👈 they are untouchable neither drew or sheamus they can,t win the bloodline
If Sami was there that wouldn't have gone down
They need to book this drew promising to keep the family off sheamus's back so he can beat roman 1 on 1 and have them reignite their friendship just for now you can even have heyman try get in-between them at points it can be a real good stop step storyline until they set up the challengers for the rumble and mania
Literal chills when Ridge said 'It's fight night'
where is sami zain 😿💔
This was awesome
Give Sheamus and Drew their old themes back already, we've been clamouring for it for years
Please put the bloodline where it belongs....to the Urin like.
The pop for sheamus tho 🔥
waiting for Regal's WAR GAMES!!!!
I like how Roman came up with the laugh and worked Sheamus's mic problem to keep things going normally. Class act from somebody who developed on the mic. Now with Mcintyre's addition it's gonna be a showdown to witness at Survivor Series War Games.
Times like these i wish they'd just bring back Written in my Face for Sheamus instead of Hellfire
would love to see the uso's face paint back in war games
Shamus is most hard working wrestler in the WWE rn and he deserves to be the top
RR the face of WWE
Always love a good fight night. 😄
Where is Sami ?
Where is sami? Why he's not here?
Bloodline sucks😆
😎⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Bloodline must lose there is only one main eventer that is roman but seeing drew sheamus and other main eventers it will be better to make bloodline loose
Who loves Roman reigns make sure click subscription button ✅
the war game is on
If They Add Braun Strowman Then Bloodline can be destroyed
We're is sami zayne
Where is sami?
wwe fans will like anything will they?
Where is Samy zayn
It’s should be brawling brutes Drew McIntyre matt Riddle vs the bloodline this year men’s war games survivor series ppv  Glad Sheamus back on smackdown again
Braun should have been the one to come out
Where is Sami zany isn't he part of bloodline too?
ما بتحسن تحكي عربي
انا احبك كل يوم عشان اصير نفسك كيف تصير انت قبضاي ابغى اصير نفسك كيف تدرب انت تدرب بالحديد
This is gonna be interesting. But it's still 4 V 5
Seeing Sheamus and Drew in action together like that, Wade must be also getting excited to join them there.
they all look the same
Why is Sami not seen with the bloodline ?? Is he injured or they planning to break up Sami from bloodline ???
Roman now should get a king tribal chief chair in the ring ..
Where’s Sami??
Who want Bray vs Roman at wrestlemania 40!!!!🙋🧟
Like William Regal once said in NXT.. "8  fighters... 2 teams of 4... I think, Gentlemen, you know how this goes...  WARGAMES!!!!"
where's sami zayn though?
Why isn’t Sami zayn with the bloodline?
Roman is a savage every single week. What he produced is always the hottest thing in all of wrestling industries.
Best match for survivor Series 💪 the bloodline 🆚 these chillers 🤣
Where is sami zayn Who know?
Where's Sammy Uso when you need him?
Wwe is fake
Always Bloodline ☝
Acknowledge  roman

WWE lo oka waste person is drew McIntyre gadu peddaa gojaa gadu 🖕😂🤣👎🖕🤣👎😂😂
1:24 Roman Reigns is  now roasting Everyone 🤣🤣🤣
I love Roman laughing 😍
Don’t forget Sheamus was once a Champion before Roman
Sheamus mic wasn't feeling ucey.. also roman was laughing 😂😂😅
How to get a body like Drew McIntyre 🤔
Their fifth member has to be Kevin Owens, they need to start the dissolution of the Bloodline storyline at some point.
Ok I see, Sheamus vs Roman at Royal Rumble and Sheamus vs Gunther at Wrestlemania.
Where is Sami uso
☝️💙 Roman 👿 only king of the Bloodline 💥🔥💯
Imagine bad news barret and the rest of the league of nations return to help sheamus
1:24 lol
02:06
Drew McIntyre and Sheamus 🤘🏻
00:47
WWE MAKES IT SIMPLE, BLOODLINE SHOWS UP SO I DO
I can't wait for wwe to be done with the bloodline at this point its so damn boring 😴 the results are always the same theres nothing interesting about them anymore
The bloodline is wining in war games
I don't know what so special about Bloodline but I can watch their any segment on repeat anyday....plz don't end this..... I m loving this so much 🥺🥺 After Roman who will carry the blue brand

THE BLOODLINE CAN KISS MY A*****!!!!!!!!

chaos and finish ....lol
Did anyone else here think Roman reigns sounded like mcafee when he laughed lol
(Butch) Enough Talkin it's FIIGHT NIGHT 🌃 LOL 😆 and CONGRATS 👏🏾🎉 to u Fella Sheamus on gettin married to his beautiful wife 💯
WWE Superstars are sick of tired. Enough is enough for bloodlines. War is coming...
I will never get tired of Roman's reactions to Drew coming to the ring
Someone Needs To Fix Sheamus Microphone!
Didn't expect Butch had a long hair 🤣
What must an alien from another world think of the human race, still savage and certainly not quite ready for a visit.
bro ain’t nobody sure about himself like Solo. bro stands in the ring like he knows he’ll chew everybody’s head in it off.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
one night without Sami and already it’s fire
I hope Karion Cross won't be a problem.
UK vs US its war
🔥
mcintyre now feels like an obsessed ex to roman
☝️
What a shame………. Roman was going to acknowledge them at the end of the night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Damn you brawling bruts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where's Sami?
Definitely screams WarGames!
🔥🔥🔥
Brawling Brutes ,Shemaus, McIntyre and Tyler Bate vs Bloodline Survivor Series
You see what happens when the honorary uce is missing. People start getting ideas of defying the bloodline
Can't wait to see Sheamus against roman reigns
somebody's getting fired
we need Samy Zayn lol help Roman emipire  😂😂😂😂
Acknowledge The Bloodline
May be Randy Orton the fifth member.
Where is sammy
Greaty way to bring Sheamus into the fold, ive never liked the guy, face or heel, he is in the wrong business and the wrong goddamn career!  Dude looks like a waiter at Nandos
W A R G A M E S ❤‍🔥
Love seeing a ring full of island boys (from opposing sides of the world) get it on
Seeing Sheamus and Drew together after their feud a few months back is actually really nice. No one knows how well the other can scrap in a good ole donnybrook like those two, and they both have scores to settle. Nice touch
Brutes+McIntyre is a brutal combo
Where’s sami
Add Drew McIntyre To The Brawling Brutes So There Is Enough For Wargames
Team McIntyre vs the bloodline at survivor series war games
Roman's laugh was hilarious and unexpected
I want Reigns vs. Sheamus... Because I think that, would be very, Ucey. 😊
Where sami at?
The Bloodline's tribute to the troops tshirt looks dope
The mic fail 😭😭😭😭
Where has Sami been? Haven’t seen him in a while
Wow Roman reigns win
Where was Sami?
Please get rid of the butch character, please I beg mercy.
Can sheamus please please please go back to his old theme song. Just imagine the Sheamus and the Brawling Brutes coming out to Written in my Face!!!! 😳😳💪🏻💪🏻
Nice save from Roman with the mic not working stuff!
where is sami ?
A time know.
When will the titles be separated? I think it sucks that WWE allows the bad guys to win, that they both have titles, I wish that many would boycott this show, it doesn't work that way anymore
Lol Roman laughing just shows how far he’s come with mic training after John Cena
Missing Sami Zayn in Bloodline
bro tried to say “you want a War? you got one” but his mic was bugging out LMAOOOOO
Mactyr kitni bar mar khayege kitni bar har gya phir bhi shrm nhi aye
Where's sami Y'all??
They should add Drew to their group he make a perfect brute
Sami Zayn?
Where is the honorary uce
In the immortal words of William Regal “WAR GAMES”
ok srsly at least learn to throw fake punches. punching shoulders back isnt that bad, no need to punch the air.
roman experience a lot. and there will be some time title
The Tribal Chef Roman Reigns And The Bloodline 🩸 Will Rule The World 🌎.
Without Sami Zayn and Paul Heyman the Bloodline would flat line
Could Pete Dunne be back ? 0:50
Drew Mcintyre Best wrestler 💪
Wargames!!!
ه
Send dem go war games like
Romans tribal chief character is the best in WWE history. How he just has his henchmen and only gets his hands dirty when he has to but when he does he just dominates people
War games
Anybody can beat Roman,Kevin Owens had him beat in the last man standing match when he had him handcuffed,they stopped the match so the ref can uncuff him so he could win instead.kevin rightfully won the match
Roman Reigns laughs like Joaquin Pheonix's Joker
Every time Drew McIntyre song hits the whole stadium goes CRAZY FOR MCINTYRE
Where’s sami
When Drew’s music starts it sends chills down my arms lol
Adding Drew makes sense but what about Kross ?
Wargames
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Drew loser is why coming
Reigns vs sheamus for undisputed word titles would slap.
I can see the match between roman and drew over and over again 😌😍
They should have 8 man WarGames match and leave Sami to focus on the World Cup tournament and win the whole thing
Drew And Roman In A Hell In A Cell Make It Happen
Roman has ptsd whenever Brock or drew music hits lol
I called it when they injured Sheamus that this match was gonna happen.
where is sami zayn
I just cant get over it how absolutely ridiculous Pete Dunne looks just jumping around and waving his arms like a tennis ball at the beginning.
Where's sami?
"And Roman Reigns with a boot to McIntyre's face" uhmmm...Cole, that wasn't just a boot, that was an Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Patented Bred' to the face
Now this what I'm talking about thank you WWE
Dream
This feud is gonna be awesome! All parties involved look so happy to be working on this storyline together
Shamus needs 1 more wwe championship run
You'll lucky SAMI wasn't there
This is awesome finally real wrestling,  nice to see someone shut the bloodline up and Roman isn't WWE your show so why isn't my mics working
👊
Drew is just gonna keep jobbing to the bloodline.
1:24 that laugh tho
I was just waiting for Drew and here he comes 😭
I ecknowledge you my tribal chief  Iam from Egypt 🇪🇬
This better be the match at Wargames cause that would be lit
I love triple H. Thank you for bring back the real wwe Mr HHH
Honestly the 4 brutes might as well be called Kingdom lol
That mic botch is definitely a work. It is done by Sami Uso. Hear back what word did Sheamus said when the mic is working.
That was awesome !
8 fighters, 2 teams of 4, WARGAMES
Where was sami zayn ?
We need to see solo win the us and the intercontinental championship
🔥
cmon Drew ,WATP
الصراحه هؤلاء الحثاله  والشرذمه والاوغاد  عصابة الشر  رمان. رنز. وحاشيته. كرهونا في wwe
Tamina or Ava raine would make the perfect fit to be apart of the bloodline
War games
By the way. Where is Sami Uso
Sheamus had his wedding within the week & also went to the gym with Bianca without broken arm but here is he with a broken arm...how comes
where's sami?
Well plan one didn’t work but plan two definitely. If the mic doesn’t work, just brawl it out
I have a great plan Sheamus and Drew McIntyre and the and The brawley brutes All those eight men in war games
Romans face change when’s Drew music hits 😂
Finalmente puseram alguém que tenha hipótese de mandar a bloodline abaixo , sheamus de volta e o escocês Drew McIntyre 🏰⚔️
Sheamus your mic 🤣
give me Sheamus vs Roman for the title soon!!
Where's Sami?
Before: face roman vs heel sheamus Now: heel roman vs face sheamus?
It's FIGHT NIGHT!! Gets me every time.
This should be a good wargames match
Sheamus is still one of the best from the last decade
WARGAMES!!!!
Drew and sheamus,  the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Am we Haven't see Sheamus Have a Title match to Roman Reigns ?
If they're gonna go for 5v5, Brawling Brutes need one more man. Looks like Wade Barrett is gonna make his wrestling comeback soon.
That line for Roman reigns.. 💥💥♨️♨️
War gaamessssss
Where's Samy?
this is gonna be an awesome war games showdown.
WWWWAAAAARRRRGGGGAAAMMMMEESSS
The funny thing is, they can still have this go 5v5...
THE BLOODLINE VS SHEAMUS, BUTCH, HOLLAND, OWENS & MCYNTYRE.
what the hell was that laugh
I was there
2/10 show, only because Bray thing was decent
AN ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUSLY TERRIBLY AWEFLY BAD ending the show. I got me so LESS interested in Survivor Series. I thought something awesome was gonna happen but nope. Or a callout. Triple H has earned a new nickname; and that name is TRIPLE L
Where's Samy ?
im so tired of dis drew vs roman beef
SHEAMUS VS ROMAN PLEASE HHH PLEASE,bring back 2015
😍😍
4v4 survivor series
one unemployed audio technician, everyone knows the rules.
Love the way the bloodline behave and the tribal chief you too much ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘
Well written segment with everyone doing their part.
Why the hell did they just cut off like that? There were still 2 minutes left last night but for some reason they felt the need to just end the show.  Very dumb.
I'm tired of drew man
Weres sami uce
Wearing Breds 😂 dam son
Where Sami tho
Drew McIntyre is better than Roman and that's truth we  see recently
I smell something…. WARGAMES
Sheamus and Drew Mcintyre.........Together that's a dangerous combination
Where sami
Where's sami?
It's also great to see sheamus and Drew mcintyre reunite knowing the fact their close friends in real life
One family holding all titles is getting boring.
McIntyre : i'm not done with u
Fair play to Roman for improvising
Where sami
2 Words: War Games
Where Sami?
WARGAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WWE
War Games
Where was Sammie
Drew McIntyre WOULD be WWE Undisputed Universal Champion IF it wasn't for Solo Sikoa. This is going to be a good Feud for McIntyre and The Brawling Brutes
I CALLED IT WARGAMESSSS!!!!!!!
WARGAMES!!! Oh, I miss Sir Regal screaming that announcement
Greeeaaaaaat another roman and drew feud

Survivor series wargames drew McIntyre and the brawling brutes vs bloodline hope they get revenge
Where is Kevin owens 😔
Scottish and Irish connection
The first main roster war games you want to be a part of them
Great watch this brawl with Sheamus group and Drew and The Bloodline and Paul Heyman watch on.💙🤍🖤😅😅😅👍👍
WARGAMES!  The only question now is who is gonna take the last spot McIntyre's team. I call Kevin Owens!
That mic did Sheamus dirty bro 😂
if this isnt an 8 man tag match in the making idk what it is
WARGAMES
I was rooting for Sheamus to take the IC title from Gunther (their feud is far from over), but I’m down for this.
That laugh from Roman Reigns  make me suprised
WARGAMES!!!!!
Roman sounds like the rock
WARGAMES LOADING
Ucey!!
The Mic fail was pure Gold 😂😂
He can't really make the mic work indeed lol 😂 can't hear ya Sheamus.
Where is Sami?! 😔
War games!
Seems like it's gonna be McIntyre who would be the one to end Roman's reign.
Sheamus, Ridge Holland, Butch and Drew Mclntyre attack the Bloodline really very interesting this whole situation intrigues me a lot all this maybe we will see a Wargames match at Survivor Series between these 8 great athletes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WWE has now turned into Reigns family arena!
I didn't acknowledge you tired of seeing him,ssly they are others who deserve the title more than part timer roman
Drew, hunter roman anywhere 😁
Romans laugh omg😂
Well we already know the teams for survivor series am I right?!
Mic didn't work but fists do 👌great by Wade
Seeing Roman Crack after the mic kept glitching 🤣🤣🤣that wasn't planned
What roman was about to say
Scotland vs the USA if shamus join,I see
This is sounds like a insane Wargames match
I was there last night and had the best time of my life. First time seeing wrestling in actual person
Where is samy zayn?
Survivor series will be Drew & the brawling brutes v the bloodline
Anybody else who saw the fear Roman got the moment Drew's music hit
Sheamus , Mcintyre And the Brutes vs the bloodline in wargames  then sheamus vs reigns for the wwe and  universal titles in the following ppv BOOK IT HHH
Where's Sami??
WWE give shamus another title run
I’m coming to smack down November 18
Lol Drew accidentally hits Ridge Holland at the end then goes after Solo..the confusion
Told y’all I was right. Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn join in 2 weeke
WARGAMES
They need to add riddle to this feud and sami zayn in the Bloodline so they can have a WarGames Match
Roman Reigns vs Sheamus no war
O campeão voltou Sheamus
The Bloodline vs Sheamus, The Brawling Brutes, Drew, and Kevin Owens
Drew vs Sheamus vs Roman Reigns
O guerreiro escocês com o guerreiro irlandês
Wwe war games e survivor series
Wargames time. Bloodline (Roman, Jimmy, Jey, Solo, and Sami) vs. The Brawling Brutes (Sheamus, Ridge & Butch) Drew, and a mystery partner.  Brawling Brutes and Drew need one more partner and it's Wargames time.
Roman Reigns vs Sheamus no war games
Defeat the bloodline!♥️🙏
Roman Reigns vs Sheamus no war games
Roman Reigns vs Sheamus no war games

They could have done this so much better if the mic worked and i feel like they could have called drew out on the mic instead but I’m still hyped for this

Thing is, People actually love the bloodline segments now so it doesn’t even feel like heel work anymore 🤣
Paul Heyman
Roman Reigns vs Sheamus no war games
Roman Reigns o chefe da tribo
The bloodline stand strong
Universal champion
Tag team champion
Just a little fantasy booking I thought of, but how about McIntyre and the Brawling Brutes vs The Bloodline at WarGames, with the Bloodline's titles on the line? They lose, tag titles go to the Brutes (Freebird Rule) and the world titles go to whoever scores the winning fall.
Sheamus e drew vs solo sikoa e Roman Reigns
Wtf is a blwd line ?
Isso é war games
WAR GAMES!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sheamus retorna com The Brawling Brutes e Drew McIntyre para derrubar a the bloodline

War games
It's a shame the mic didn't work. Would have been much more an imlactful promo.
What ever, no one can breaks the Bloodline, because they are the best of all the best💪💞🏆🙏family is a one heart 💞☝️
Love to see drew become part of the brutes….except he talks funny compared to the other two.
The bloodline help roman reigns to win
Top g is better   We are ATTTAACKING THE MATRIX   Change your profil to the top g  and comment on every bad video *top g is better * and every good video comment * top g*
Brawling Brutes vs The Bloodline at Survivor Series? I'VE GOT MY ATTENTION NOW!!!!
Solo sikoa vs Drew
The usos vs Drew
Roman Reigns vs Sheamus
Survivor series
War games
Sheamus está de volta
War Games! War Games! War Games!
WAAARGAMES.
Usos? More like BOO-SOS!
Roman reigns laugh sounds like Austin theory lmao
Michael Cole ain't wrong though.  Cause Drew McIntyre still got a score against Solo Sikoa before Kross get in the way.😁
This is a great feud. Sadly, nothing is going to come from this because WWE protects part time mid card Roman. Interesting to see what happens now that the Bloodline are no longer the top merchandise sellers.
I sense a War Games match in the future.
As much as I admit it's good to see Sheamus back from his injury, I was surprised to see McIntyre allied with him and The Brawling Brutes.  I mean talk about the unexpected moment.  Cause I guess that McIntyre and Sheamus really became pals again after all.  I may not know what'll happen next, but if I have to guess then perhaps there'll be Drew McIntyre and The Brawling Brutes against The Bloodline in the Wargames match at Survivor Series.🙂😯😃☺️😁
God I wish Ceasero was here for this one.. .please WWE do a quick trade with AEW just for Ceasero to do Warzgames
Where's Sami? I don't like this. We haven't see Sami Uso in over a week now. That's not very Ucey of you WWE
Yep, this is gonna be an epic WarGames match
Lmaooo the 🎤 😂
Roman reigns and the bloodline and Sami uso vs the brawling brutes sheamus and drew McIntyre at survivor series war games I called it
Botch!!!!
Then Wargames it is.
I love you Drew❤
Roman and Pete Dunne in the same ring, at the same time, wow
Great to see the Brawling Brutes & Drew McIntyre put their differences aside ruing the Bloodlines acknowledgment ceremony. Also, it was good to see that Samy Zyan wasn't there to help the Bloodline.
Wargames?
I refuse to acknowledge the Usos, because people don't deserve to be rewarded when they receive multiple DUIs.
BORING
The handled the mic cutting on and off way to smooth. I feel like it was part of the segment cuz The BB just be fighting rather than talking 😂😂
Where's Sami Uso
WARGAMES
WILL ROMAN REIGNS DEFEND HIS TITLE AT SURVIVOR SERIES PEOPLE????????
It's about time someone stand up to the bloodline
now at survivor series wargames roman reigns will defend his title against anyone people? an answer please
I'm tried of The Usos winning all the Tag Team Titles.
THE NEW DAY CAN ACTUALLY WIN THE BELTS BACK.
Solo remind me of umaga!.
So no one else is over the undisputed title reigns? Both the Usos and Roman? When will we get new champions? More championship matches? I am so over it now😒🤦‍♀🙄😑
WARGAMES!
Banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after banger after
🔥
Where was Sami zayn
I’d like to think they would do Solo Sikoa vs Drew McIntyre and Sheamus vs Roman Reigns for the title. Would be great i think
the only mic skill roman have is make fun if something accidently malfunctioning.. other else, boring.. he have everything and face of wwe. he should be already good with his mic skill at this rate.
So we’re suppose to believe the Bloodline are suppose to be all about outnumbering your opponent yet Jimmy and Jey run after McIntyre one by one.
The end of bloodline is coming... Believe that... McIntyre and Shemaus already enough... 💪💪💪😘😘😘
This is guna be sweet af
Las perritas defendiendo al perrito mayor el perrito no puede paliar solo si no están sus perritas defendiendo los
Drew Mcintyre, The Brawling Brutes and Kevin Owens vs The Bloodline at WARGAMES!!!
Wargames!
Bruh that mic botch tho
ياناس إتقو الله
Where Sami zayn at?
You know who id love to see take the titles off roman ...... Sheamus he deserves another title run
Roman,Jey,Jimmy,Zayn,Sikoa vs Drew,Sheamus,Butch,Holland,Owens ..................  ................WAR GAMES🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think sheamus should be the one to beat roman
The Bloodline vs The Brawling Brutes &Drew (Waaah games)
WARRRRRRRR GAMESSSSSSSS
What happened to sami Zayn
Gotta love to see sheamus back in action!
Just when Roman was about to acknowledge them 😭
England Scotland Ireland working together ?
I'm so hyped to see this match!
After war games this be interested we got     Drew vs solo Sheamus vs reigns Brawling brutes vs usos at wwe tlc or day 1
Roman didnt forget his lose against Sheamus at Survivor Series when Shemaus cashed in his contract hahahaha
Welcome United Kingdom
It's gonna be Samoa vs Celts
There's no love lost between both parties. Nice that Sheamus and McIntyre put aside their differences knowing that they have a match to settle with "The BLOODLINE." Neither or them haven't forgotten about the tribal chief and the Scottish Warrior haven't forget about Sikoa costing him the Heavyweight title at his hometown on "Clash At The Castle " when he interfere. So with all of that, let that be settle with "WARGAMES."
I love how triple HHH & Steph bringing that old attitude area feeling back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman sounding more and more like The Rock every time he talks
Smackdown's definitely the show to watch this year. Imperium, Rey Mysterio, Bloodline, LA Knight, Bray Wyatt, Drew McIntyre, Karrion Kross. All of them so far looking strong and involved in interesting storylines.  Compare this to how RAW's been doing lately and it doesn't even feel like it's the same person booking both shows.
Where is Sammy?
Where is Sami?
Drew Mcintyre is the ONLY one who can dethrone roman reigns.... he went war with brock lesnar and won clean.
"were sick of you having the numbers advantage"  *still decide towalk into the ring at a number disadvantage*
All we need is Regal to yell WARGAMES!
The usos and their cousin roman reigns are not more than a group of cowards with no balls inside their pants, they always depend on number advantage to win their matches, and if some body can split them they will definetly loose all their titles from long time a go, this day must come sooner or later, i hope that mccintyre  as well as the new dayv  are  gonna help the buretes in  or new day inorder to beat the usos for at least on ofvthevtagteams titles which must be seoerated one day or another
Didn't The Brutes violently feud Mcyntire? Feels like it was only yesterday. Now they're friends?
This never happened when Vince was in charge. Js
When I see Drew against Roman, I can only think about 3MB vs The Shield.
Did anyone catch drew about to attack ridge holland 😂
But where’s Sami USO?
Add Sami and wade
And here I was expecting Bobby Lashley to show smh
Too much of everything is bad ama end there let someone pick it up 👆
This was a good episode
Sheamus should challenge for the title. They made him look kinda weak here.
I assume we’re gonna get KO joining them
😒 Where ya going with this! Cool segment dou!
Where is Sami
Boring to see bloodline gosh I need the changes
Drew is low key getting annoying now
Drew again smh get that man on raw bro is boring
If this is gonna be a WarGames match then I'm very curious on who's gonna be the 5th member for Drew's Team
Props to Roman for trying to make this promo feel more real than scripted
Why’ve they gotta ruin it just let them have a celebration nobody’s really arsed
Well that’s our  war games main event set
Whoever is in charge of that mic is so fired I
1:14 “We can’t hear you!” 😂
WARGAMES!!!!!!!!
This is where not having Sami with you GETS YOU!
Great! Hope the 5th memebr will be Cody or someone.
As usual when this match happens the bloodline will win. Lmao. Wwe should fire HHH at this point lmao
Coward roman never win a championship match by himself coward roman always need a bk-up stupid wwe
So...overnight, Sheamus and McIntyre are buddies again with ZERO build-up?  Yeah, ok....WWE...
War games bout to go crazy
Whoever was in production truck for this segment wants fireing. Botchamania.
Sheamus: .... Our Allegiance .... at tonight is the start ....... of the bloodline! Roman : 🤣 (in Seth Rollins laughter)
WAR GAMES
What can I say....WARGAMES!!
Man it sucks to see the mic go out in Sheamas' return, but that was a solid save by Roman.
Look forward to see Drew win one of the main WWE titles 😀
Where is Sami usos
Sheamus deserves to dethrone Roman
where's sami
Where is Sami
Sami will be involved & i’d imagine KO joins the brutes 👌 setting up for USOS vs KO & Sami at Mania!
The bloodline (full team with sami) vs brawling brutes, drew McIntyre and Wade Barrett looks fun
I'm sick of it. I think I've lost both my fun and story
Of course if u realized this means, WarGames! Survivor Series soon......
Tribal chief was about to acknowledge the USOS before this kicked off!
1:28 Roman improvise right🤣🤣🤣
Would’ve been the perfect time to bring back sheamus old theme
drew and sheamus being pals again would be fun Can't Mcintyre join the brutes as well? He's from Scottland thats close enough
Sheamus talks like he was drowning😂. Still it was gold tho
Bro McIntyre just keeps on coming back
Glad to see Sheamus back as a threat, The Great White Shark, The Celtic Warrior, Top Tier
Heyman at the beginning 😂😂
Looks like we gonna see the bloodline vs drew and brawling brutes at survivor series wargames
Hear me out, wade barret
Dude what the hell? Interrupting the Tribal Chief like that?! Couldnt it wait until they were backstage again? The continuous disrespect of everyone on the roster never seems to end. Wow! At this point, our Tribal Chief should just jump these people backstage and see how they like being interrupted. Screw getting acknowledgement, our Tribal Chief should just force everyone to. Make it an "I acknowledge you" match for the next couple of PPVs up until Wrestlemania. Ah man, these people make me sick. Still no acknowledgement? After all this time? We dont deserve our Tribal Chief for his endless patience against this growing resistance
If Brawling brutes and drew McIntyre come together it will be a fight night and a problem to the bloodline.
Wargames
Where the hack is Sami!
Where was Sami Zayn?!
The way Roman started laughing at Sheamus is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
hope mcintyte doesnt get another shot that man is overpushed
Hope you fellas take down the bloodline sick and tired of those cheaters with the tribal loser as the biggest loser
Again roman vs mc intyre… i’m sick  Why not Logan Paul ?
I want a new undisputed champ. pls let others reign not just the bloodlines. 🙄
Where is Samy?
But hi-key I wanna see Sikoa vs butch.
is it just me or…Sheamus deserves another world title run…
1:27 Roman got jokes huh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is sami?
imagine bloodline vs brutes mcintyre and wade barrett
Great show in the Ring to watch 🖥️ Always interesant with The Bloodline and Roman Reigns The Bloodline VS The Browling brutes at WarGames in No DQ match This sounds really epic, insane and firey 🔥🔥🔥 Drew Mcintyre deserve rematch for WWE and Universal Championship Like who agree with me... 👏😉😃
Where is Sami?
Well that was unexpected laugh from Roman 🤣
Sheamus va roman?
I guess we all know what that means…. WARGAMES
Sheamus has to be the guy who will take romans title
Looks like we found the survivor series main event
شيمس
Roman imitating Sheamus accent was the best part of the segment
2 English men (particularly one of them being a YORKSHIRE MAN 😁) and a Scottisn and Irish man taking care of business 😆👊
The bloodline outfit is outstanding 😎😎😎
Loving how over Sheamus is right now
I miss those days when Roman was 1vs all
Looks like we have the second Survivors Series match.  Bloodline Vs Brawling Brutes & Drew Judgement day vs O.C   Not bad.
Looks like we have the second Survivors Series match.  Bloodline Vs Brawling Brutes & Drew Judgement day vs O.C   Not bad.
We have our war games match at survivor series!
Was the mic not working an accident or a work?
Roman afraid drew
Its a shame on wwe . They're unable to rotate the championship. In 2030, wwe will announce the undisputed championship Roman reigns and tag team champion usos.. it's really boring 😴  one family has all the titles.. waste of watching this family drama 😂😂😂
Bloodline( Reigns, USOs, Solo n Zayn) vs Team McBrutes (McIntyre, Sheamus, Butch, Holland and KO) WarGames
So who's going to be the 5th member of the Brawling Brutes at Survivor Series?
Brawling brutes and drew need a 5th man for war games.... And that man has to be Kevin Owens!
But where’s Sami Uso 😂
The British (and Irish) are coming!!!
Sheamus and drew  back freinds
Romans laugh😂
WAR GAMEEEEEEEES
Roman is the best of all time ☝️☝️☝️
LMAO I love how Drew attacked the wrong person at the end xDD
띠어리 가방 어이없이 쓴거 넘 아깝다 차라리 세스가 승자였다면 캐싱인 했으면 로만 이길수도 있는데 아쉽다
Sheamus and Mcyntire together? yes pls
I love butch ❤️
💜
This shows us how great Roman really is. With the blooper of the mic cutting out, he immedtialtly thought of something to say on the spot to give the tech guy's some time to fix the mic's connection.
I thoguth  they got separate after jey uso vs roamn
Roman's laugh tho 😭😭😭
War games?
I think there's something that happened there that is lacking?  William Regal: WAR GAMES!!!
Can't even get the   Microphone to work😂
I like how WWE are emphasising the importance of how long titles are being held rather than, how many times it’s been held.
Very good Roman 🤴💪💪💪👊👊👊👌👌👌
Roman hitting a goofy ahh laugh and messing with Sheamus was hilarious 😂
Hi there what up
😂😂😂 nobody gonna talk about Roman saving The mic not working moment A++ Quick thinking!
I hope we get a war games match between these groups
Roman great good good
WAR GAMES !!
Waiting on William to come out and say “WAR GAMES”
Amazing the difference 7 years made for Roman and Sheamus.
Finaly WE sick of roman cheater Always win same scénario good to see somthing New
THIS Roman vs THIS Sheamus would make me forget they feuded for the WWE title a few years ago.
Sheamus' return was ruined by the mic malfunction
This is some Forrest Gump shot going on with his microphone
The constant change of camera angles is making me dizzy!
Wargames!!
Really want Sheamus vs Roman Reigns down the line, sounds epic
Sheamus should dethrone Gunther first
Still, Roman will stay in his reign, I dunno, maybe for next year and the next year afer and so on Because what?  The Bloodline That's why  😂
Quit The Tribal Chief has to Something to say to Jimmy and Jay🤔
Kya gandiyapa h ye
Alright!! A 4V4!!
👎
Anyone else want to see McIntyre and Sheamus and the Undisputed Tag-Team Champions?
Where is sami?
SHEAMUS FOR UNIVERSAL CHAMPIONSHIP
The Bloodline is not that tough when it's a fair fight and the number's are equal
Sami now does the superman punch
The song at the end of the video is good
Reigns mocking Sheamus with the mic not working was hilarious.
He never defeated anyone on his own.  He's completely Fake Champion
Sheamus was away getting married......glad he's back tho...
So I'm guessing this 8 tag team match will be in SS war games ppv
I smell a survivor series match ❤️😁💪
McIntyre timings kind of off
To be honest I wanna see Seth Rollins disrespect Reigns on RAW, then at WarGames Sami Zayn and Rollins have a title match and Zayn wins. Would be good for Sami to hold a title too. McIntyre, and the Brutes vs Solo Sikoa and the Usos. Reigns vs Sheamus Title Match.
I do not acknowledge you cause i hate you, and that's what you deserved
very nice nice nice
Sami zayn?
Welp, looks like Roman, Usos, Solo, and Sami vs Sheamus, Butch, Ridge, McIntyre, and maybe Riddle for Wargames
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻🤣🤣😀😀😅😅😂🇪🇬🇪🇬⚔️⚔️⚔️🗡️🗡️⚔️🗡️🗡️⚔️🗡️⚔️🗡️🗡️
Basically the Bloodline vs United Kingdom
gyess we have a survivior series match
It's about time a group of people stood up to Roman Reigns and the Bloodline.
The Sheamus shoulder tape reminded me of Cesaro😞
Welcome back Sheamus
I still remember at Survivor Series 2015 Sheamus cashed in the Money In The Bank briefcase & defeated Roman Reigns to win the WWE Championship moments after Roman defeated Dean Ambrose in the final of a tournament to crown a new champion.
Where is Sami
Sheumas the best Roman i hop sheumas vs Roman and Sheumas wins
So what happened to Sami?
Did drew accidentally smack ridge holland at the end there..
Bruh, McIntyre again... can we please have someone fresh or are they waiting for Randy or a big Sammy turn?
Wargames right there
Great to Shamus back in the  ring. Wrestling 🤼‍♂️. This time it's all out WAR. AS HE HAS FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE WRESTLER 🤼‍♂️ DREW MCINTYRE AND the Brawling Brutes as back up. ❤️
Drew McIntyre reunites with the returning Sheamus as two English warriors teamed up with The Brawling Brutes to take down A Undisputed Bloodline members, Solo Sikoa, Unified WWE Tag Team Champions The Usos and WWE Champion Roman Reigns  Booking for Winners Take-All Tornado Tag Team WarGames Match for all gold on the line at Survivor Series when WWE goes WarGames
Where the hell is sami zayn?
The bloodline is boring now
Where is Sami?
I have a feeling roman was gona turn  on jey and put solo with jimmy as champions but they were interrupted
Gdzie jest Sami?
Where was Sami?
The Bloodline is unstoppable ☝🏻
The shape of Drew is the best in all of the company in my opinion, man is on another level
I love how cool  solo  is
Was he about to acknowledge them?
Ooootra vez mcIntyre
Acknowledge by your sister roman
Yesterday's Smackdown theme was : God of War : Ragnarök  Well done, WWE.
Where tf is Sami?
Where's sami
So Sheamus is the next opponent
I see WAR GAMES for these guys
0:22 The Brawling Brutes & Sheamus reunite & attacks the Bloodline, but it was 3 on 4. 2:05 When McIntyre came out, he helped the Brawling Brutes fend off the Bloodline. Which is why we must have an 8 man tag match.
Where’s Sami?
How come no one is curious to where Sami has been? Lol
I miss you so so so much my babe my One and only king romanreings love him with all my entire heart my star my champion l o.m.l my king romanreings greatest of all times ♥️♥️♥️❤️❤️☝️☝️
I can’t take the brutes seriously. They have so much hair in that tiny cap. So unexpected 😂
That mic sucked
2:55 Butch superman punch 👌😂
YAWN
Sheamus' mic not working reminded me of po Vs Shen LOL
Drew and sheamus again that is asome
Roman Reigns' laugh at 1:24 had us feeling very Ucey 😂😂😂
THIS is the NARRATIVE and VIDEO to LIKE. (WWF)

BUFFONI
WARGAMES!!!!!!
They really botched Sheamus mic up🤣🤣🤣.

The United Kingdom vs The Bloodline. Wargames!!!
2:23 Give us a kiss!
Sheamus is a legend
This is gonna lead to an epic Wargames match
Have reigns put the raw title on the line and have someone else take the pin to separate the belts and to keep reigns strong
Glad to c The Brawlin Brutes Tcb
That mic was funny af
Hi
the mic only picked up:  "AND TONIGHT, IS THE START (of the end) OF THE BLOODLINE"  And tonight is the start of the Bloodline, sure
War Games🔥!!!
Fix your mics WWE. Small indy company.
I need Sheamus v Roman for the Undisputed Championship, please and thank you
Wade should have jumped in, great way to bring him back part time worker.
Can't wait to seeDrew As the New Champ once again!
This was awesome and amazing to see Sheamus back. Drew McIntyre getting involve! Sign me up and put them into War games Survivor series
4 v 4 !!!!
I'm sick and tired of the fact that Drew Mcintyre has to get beaten by Roman Reigns multiple times, he deserves more
Love Roman and Seamus riffing
You know what really really ruined it? It wasn't the Brutes. It wasn't Drew. It was Fox cutting the show with 2 minutes left. What an absolute joke. We wouldn't see USA Network end RAW with 2 minutes left.
Drew!
Goofy ahh staged wrestling
Butch against Zayn gonna be incredible
Where's the honorary Uce?????
This is what I expected to see. And if this won't work out if hope Brock Lesner joins
Sincerely voces sabem divertir se sabe
Is the title even going to be on the line ?
Can we have barrett shout war games in place of regal please??
A Little Prelude To Survivor Series WarGames
We are now tired of this bloodline , and it's so sad to see brock and Bobby not attacking the bloodline
Where is Samy
It's awful how the mics didn't work here, but the fighting was excellent enough for this segment to work. Oh, well.
Ridge Holland injured that mic's neck that's why it stopped working properly.
I love that Solo and Drew are enemies now, also I have a feeling the 5th member for the Brutes is Owens.
Where Sami
The Fifth member for Scottish Brutes is Sami Zayn
Is this Continues at The Survivor series at The War Games Match?
Mcintyre, Sheamus, Butch & Holland + Reigns, Usos & Sikoa = *Wargames???*
The Bloodline meeting McIntyre and Brawling brutes after attack
Please can we have sheamus us roman again
Stupid fake wrestling
I miss samy
Where was Sami ucey tonight, anyone know, did something happen
Sammy where is he 🤔
Go get Gunther as the fifth member for wargames. The enemy of my enemy is my ally!
Wargames!!!!!!!?!!
It needs to be a war games match but before something happens with jay and it makes reigns mad so he replaces him with Sami and then it pushes jay over the breaking point and he attacks Sami and cost them a teammate and the match and then he gets kicked out
Man bro I just got out my couch when I saw this 🔥🔥 man the hype is coming back get ready y’all my boy my boy jar of mayonnaise looked good 💪
If willam regal was still here he would still those words that were for nxt paperviews for 5 years but I guess I say who is ready for wargames!!!?
Quran 112
I’ve been saying they should of done this. But I have it be a trio match. Roman and the usos vs sheamus and the brawling brutes and Gunther and imperium
Where.  Is Sami Uso
Where's the fuckass poorshit bastardfack named Sami Zayn?!
Drew vs Sheamus vs Roman for the undisputed championship at survivor series!! Book it!!!
Now theres equal..come on wwe, have some wwe trios championships
This was one of the best segments. Eveng the mic not working was perfect handle. The comeback of sheamus, the power of the Bloodline...and the entrance of Drew
McIntyre nearly clotheslines Ridge Holland at the end of the clip. 😂😂😂
The mic turned heel
If Roman doesn’t lose at Survivor Series, then I’m done.
WHERE IS SAMIZAYN YO HELP HIM
Pls where is Sami Zayn,it's not complete without him straight up!!
2:38 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

WoooooW Sheamus always attacking from behind. Lmfao cause He know Roman would Pop Him out. 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
ohh, where's Sami ? 🤔
where is samy zayn?
Did Roman just imitate Seth’s laugh? 1:25.
Now if you add K.O and Sami for each team it would be complete for Wargames
I would not mind if Sheamus beat Reigns for the titles
Hell No, we can't have another Roman vs McIntyre, we've seen enough of that
I have a very simple solution for this. WARGAMES!!!
Thsee white boys making the Samoans look small
Happy married life Sheamus
If they guys fight at war games they gotta put the titles in the line
Should have let him acknowledge his cousins first
We get Sheamus back, but where the hell Sami go?🤔
This is what I expert from these wrestlers 🤼‍♂️ if they want to bring the bloodline down 👇🏾.
where is sami?
Is it just me only, who see the frustration and fear in the eyes of Roman reigns when drew 's theme hits 😆😆...
Europeans Vs. Samoans
In my William regal voice WARGAMES this will be a match at wargames
Gang fight
Question  were  sami.Zayn
Drew joining the brutes for.........WAR GAMES
WARGAMES!!!
War Games about to be Lit
Genius move! Drew and the Brawling Brutes all have beef with the Bloodline so why not team up to fight them? But more importantly tho welcome back, Seamus!
Love the Scottish, Irish Save 😂😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪

Sheamus will take back his title after 7 years from the same man he lost to and never got a 1 on 1 opportunity after that.
Where is Sami I want Sami back asap come on Wwe
Bloodline vs Brawling Brutes And Drew McIntyre  WAR GAMES!!!
Mcintyre entering cleaning up the usos and the staredown looked like he met the mini boss of the game lol
This was a good opportunity to have Sheamus come back with written in my face 😢
Bloodline can lost this match and make drew strong
WARGAMES!!!
Mic Botch 🤣🤣🤣
Where is Sami Uso Y'alll?
war games
Where’s Sami
wheres Sami Zayn? i havent seem him with the bloodline for a while
Sokoa is bad 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is Roman hiding lol
Obviously this is leading to a war games match between The Bloodline and The Brawling Brutes and Drew. Gonna be interesting who they choose for the last guy on the brawling brutes team. Could be lots of various people at this stage
Sheamus merece um título 🔥
war games????
Add sami to the bloodline and KO to drews team
I hope the Brawling Brutes and McIntyre win and then we eventually get a Triple Threat for the title between Reigns, McIntyre and Sheamus. That will be a banger☝🏽
Bye bye sami
Sheamus seemed sluggish and lagging. That's not the Sheamus I grew up watching. 09-10 Sheamus would've cracked Roman's skull w/ brogue kick and then put him through a table. Hope WWE lights up the fire in him back.
Sheamus fight with roman is the fresh start at smackdown
Is Sami injured?
next week Sami Might be back with Some Backup ,N&SB
War Games 🔥
roman was scare from mctinre😂
Where’s Sami zayn?

Brawling brutes and drew Vs bloodline at survivor series
Wade Barrett’s Gasp. Priceless
And again no Sami? I'll take my leave then🚶‍♂️
I don't know for sure... but something smells... odd... I don't know if its the fact that that Sami ain't there or if its the fact that there were four on four... it looked like a war (nice rhyme) cough cough wargames?
THAT SHEAMUS POP 🔥
What happend to Sami Zyan this weekend? I didnt see him.
Thanks Triple H🔥🔥🔥👏
I wish we coulda seen judgement day vs bloodline
This is fake so those belts mean nothing that they might have brought them from a dollar store.
The fact that the mic got distorted the more sheamus got near the ring was funny LMAO 1:41
Love the bloodline and huge fan of the tribal chief 🔥☝🏻💙 acknowledge him yessir .
Oh this war games gone be one for the books
Wait did Sami get kicked out? Where is he?
What happened to Sami?
Where Sami Sayn

Nice to see Drew stepping back and letting Sheamus take the spotlight against Roman.

Roman vs shamus a plus Roman vs drew a plus
WAR GAMES!!!!
Who else was here and got to see tribute to troupes? (I Was)
2 words. WAR GAMES!!!!
2:56 man😂😂😂they just don’t care nomore that man was supposed to fall🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂
Haha Sheamus mic !
Next Monday, the Uso's VS New Day..... seriously! Same show every week with most wrestlers
It gives me the flashback seeing Roman and Sheamus confrontation... My god.. Those days😭😭😭how incredible it was
Brutes and MacIntyre need 1 more dude
With Sami Zayn  taking a day off the Bloodline look more serious than usual. I think he was left off the show intentionally to make sure no one break character so this segment can properly build up WARGAMES!!!
the brawling brutes and sheamus have backup drew mcintyre
The Newly Wed Man Is Back!
Where's Samy?
Sheamus vs Roman inject ittttttt
0:52  Jey's like "PLEASE SAY IT AIN'T SO!!"

Fire the Technician who works with the Mic
Talk about production issues
Where is sami
just saying i feel like bloodline will win as cross will take out drew after that hit drew did with the car door but who knows gonna be exciting to see how it all plays out
10 fighters. 2 teams of 5. I think you know how this goes.    WAR GAMES!!!
Where was Sami?
Drew mcintyre vs el pendejo de roman reingns en survivor series por el wwe universal championship eso sería muy bueno para los negocios.
Soooooo damn sick of anyone in the bloodline
Meh easy win for the bloodline I expected better
This elevates everybody involved. Good stuff.
It's about time roman drop those titles
Europe vs Samoa
The face Roman  did when Drew MacIntyre's theme played lol
That's a fight I wouldn't want to see in the streets 😂
where is sami
This is what we are gonna see on WARGAMES 💣
I hope its Sheamus vs Roman and not Drew vs Roman again. plsss
Good old brutes as the rock said just bring it
The four of them should call themselves the United Kingdom.
Don’t wanna see Drew vs Roman it’s played out at his point lol I would rather see Brock again m 😂
Where is sami
Sheamus and Drew McIntyre back together again
when roman laughed he lowkey sounded like seth lol
Samoan stable vs G.B. Union (Irish+Scotish)?
Butch will be the only one who had experience in Wargames as he was part of last year’s event
Add Owens and Sami and book it.

I'm really glad to see them going with these matchups for WarGames. Adding KO would make it even more exciting. Hope this leads to a Sheamus and Roman feud and not Drew again after this event.
Hmm 🤔 how interesting… 😅 I really do sincerely hope that the Brawling Brutes with Sheamus and McIntyre can finally put an end to the Bloodline and Usos domination.
The British are coming the British are coming
Roman vs Shemus vs Drew at Survivor Serious will be epic asf. The way Roman got scared when Drew's music hit.
Where is sami
Drew Mcintyre 🗡🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 and The Brawling Brutes 👨🏻‍🦰🇮🇪👨🏼‍🤝‍👨🏽🇬🇧 vs The Bloodline 🇺🇲🇼🇸🏆🔴🔵🧔🏻👬🏽 at Survivor Series War Games 🌙🔴🔵🤺.
Good ending
Good improv by Roman with the mic issue lol But this should be a good feud leading up to Survivor Series.
Da ultimate showdown IT'S FIGHT NIGHT
Where's KO😂
Sheamus, McIntyre and the brutes (Europe) taking over the limit against The Bloodline reign of terror goes over the edge.
Was he about to acknowledge the Usos?
where tf is sami
Where's Sammy been?
I’m tired of drew McIntyre just going up against Roman he’ll never beat him, from the amount of attempts he did for beating Roman down, he still lose to him, doesn’t matter how hard he tries he always lose to him
But the rock is watching you
This is going to war games
Bring back Written in My Face please, we need thatt
I always like the fact that everytime Drew is feuding with the bloodline Roman always have this scared and confused look of his, Shows you that out of everyone it was only Drew that mamaged to actually destroy the bloodline and if it weren't for Solo he could have been the world champ right now
When the hell did drew macintire become big time, guess it’s been a while I remember him in 3mb
Making the Usos retain and look amazing, just to be handled like kids moments later.. This booking is at level of Vince
Two thing:1 war games 2 the uso vs brawling brutes and sheamus vs drew vs roman
Survivor Series WarGames
I WWE is awesome to watch buddy
"You can't even get the mic to work" damn
Roman’s laugh doesn’t sound like Roman at all lol
I hope Brawling Brutes Wins for Survivor Wargames This year ever!!!!
I see a War games match here
I see a War games match here
Man Sheamus is a big boy.
This Roman Reigns calling out the mic issue is gold. Just goes to show his improved promo skills, I support that
War Games
So Bloodline vs United Kingdom (And a 5th guy.)
Reigns laughing a lot like Rollins.
Where's Sammy?
WARGAMESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Where's Sami?
☝️ Bloodline
I smell a match….And you know what it is.😏😏                                                 WARGAMES!!!!!!!
Where's the honorary uce? Sami USO y'all?
Scottish vs Samoans 😂
Man I’m loving all these factions on the WWE roster. Makes for more story telling
Replace Brawling Brutes with New Day and add Kevin Owens. That way Wargames is New Day, Kevin Owens, Sheamus, and drew mcintyre vs The Bloodline
Where is Sami?
❤🧡💛💚💙💜
where is sami zayn ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Ah Man! They clipped it right before my favorite part: McIntyre throwing haymakers L, R, L, R...A full piece combo
😤 No one, Absolutely no one interrupts an acknowledgement celebration of my Tribal Chief end The BloodLine 🤜💥
Sheamus got a great pop, and the mic botch plus Roman making fun of it was just gold LOL. Plus, Roman's laugh was hilarious as you expect a deep laugh lol
Roman Reigns ☝️😎
1:25 I thought Patt McAfee return to laugh😂
L need semi zayn NOW
WAR GAMES
The audio technician that gave Sheamus that bad mic is an idiot. Also, WARGAMES!
pete 'butch' > bloodline trash
Now get KO in this and it's gonna be a great War Games
Where is the honorary uce?
All I heard was "WAR GAMESSSSSS"
Drew is massive
Bro I’m so tired of seeing drew
I swear drew looks more ripped everytime I see him.
The way that ended was still such a masterclass on how to build something but not give too much away and wanting to draw you back
This was awesome!!!
Golden
Setan betul roman gelakkan Shemaus
Where is Sami?
bloodline I only like the twins and their bro. but Reigns is overrated
I see a war games match is about to happen
Roman vs sheamus for the championship the match just write banger💯
Where was Samny tonight
Scottish vs Samoans.. . Damn
The way no man want to let off show the insanity each of these guys have
Wargames is coming bloodline and brawling bruts
This is like Marvel vs DC but WWE version
Calling them "the Greatest Tag Team Of All Time" is a spit in the face to the teams like The Brothers of Destruction, E&C, DX, Bret and Owen, the 2 Man Power Trip, Jeri-Show, and many other great tag teams that built this business!!! But HHH is probably used to spitting in people's faces!!!!
someone is getting fire
Roman got me crying laughing
I dont mind sheamus being champion dudes Been here so long they gotta give him a run sometimes
Someone’s getting fired😢
This went off the rails so quickly a stopwatch couldn’t even do it justice
Scottland vs Hawaii
Wow! Why a member of AEW prod team was hired? Trips man.
This was just pure chaos and insanity from the start and I love every minute of it
Reigns vs Sheamus?
Just add a pinch of Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn to this matchup, it's going to result in  pure perfection.
This is not a brawl this is war
Roman sneaker game has been impeccable
NO ME ILUSIONES OTRA VEZ PORFAVOR 💔😞
Roman always god mode💗
Hi wwe the ones
this should've been the time wherein if Regal were in WWE he'd come out and say "WAR GAMES!"
I wanna see more trolling but also very serious Roman just like now
WARGAMES🥺🥺
How many times does Roman have to beat Drew for him to learn his lesson lol
Romain laugh look like a teenagers Omg 😆
McIntyre Sheamus And Brawling Brutes vs The Bloodline WARGAMES
Sheamus vs Reigns for the Titles NEEDS to happen at this point!
bloodline vs brawling brutes and drew in war games would be awesome or if we get a tag team battle royal for the tag titles with all the teams
WWE Legendary Friday Night SmackDown Showing Tonight Man!!🙌🙌🙌😎😎😎🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🏆👑❤️🎉☺️😊💎💎☝️☝️🇺🇸🇺🇸
No Sami for tonights Smackdown I bet Jey was happy about that.😂
This will be on Bochamania!
Where is sami zaynn?
I wish Brock return and destroy all of them
Team Sheamus vs The Bloodline at Wargames
Some kind of Europeans vs Americans?
Honestly it feels so good to see Sheamus again on tv I legit missed him and it hasn’t felt the same
McIntyre 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here’s is the Real Facts! The usos are Not and I Mean NOT the real longest tag champions, they are not winning for themselves, they’re winning them for Roman aka heyman’s lap dog! He is the tag title holder not them because they really slaves! As far as facts are,Roman is not only the worst champion ever, he’s the WORST TAG champ ever and FOOOORRRREEEEVer
War games brawling brutes and mcintyre vs the bloodline
Could be KO being that 5th man because right now he the only one I can think off to team will McIntyre & The Brutes because right nobody on SmackDown screams yeah I can see him joining.
Sheamus vs Roman for the Titles🔥
Where sami?
Man mclntyre should’ve been the one to dethrone Roman no one works harder if not drew it should at least be Cody these two are the ones that deserve it most they’re willing  to for anything for wwe
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There's no stopping Drew when he is on a roll, just look at him mistakenly target Holland lol 😂
Anyone know what happened to Sami?
I am not like Roman
WAR GAMES
1:19 That Roman Laugh LMAO
Man... I wish Wade Barrett laced them up again
Good to see drew and sheamus work together again, the chemistry they have with and against each other is superb
Roman's laughter cracks me up 😆 then a brawl happened and Drew McIntyre shows up. This is a team of babyfaces they just need Riddle to join.
Ngl I'm getting tired of Roman vs drew
There are the Survivor Series teams. Add Sami and the Brutes would need one more. Maybe Madcap?
This match needs to happen at war games
There's no way WWE let that mic problems to be aired, right 🤣
this is the first time I hear roman's laugh
Man.. I'm waiting for Sheamus vs Roman
ahhhh WAR GAMESSSS
Where's Sami Zayn ?
Tribal Chief so great he even saved that mic botch. ACKNOWLEDGE HIM!
The Bloodline is complete for SSW but who one person else is there for The Brawling Brutes and Drew McIntyre ?
1. Mcintyre and the Brawling Brutes 2. Celtic Connection + Brutes = Brawling Connection?  Nvm.
Wargames
I feel the brawling brutes and drew MacIntyre should be suspended for attacking the bloodline without any reason.
The bloodline vs the brutes. Wargames will be a 5 star ppv event. Now we need more factions to declare war
Present 17 minute
I LOVE HOW ROMAN JUST STANDED😂
The Brawling Brutes & Drew Mcintyre are the best!!  Now this is a WARGAMES!!! 💙🔥💙🔥💙🔥
looks like Drew McIntyre vs. Roman Reigns 3 is on the way and this time, put both of the titles on Drew
“We can’t hear you” 😂😂
Sheamus is getting old man 😢
Roman saving sheamus because mic issues 😂
Where is sami??
This is very disrespectful thats why they will be acknowledging the bloodline after their threw with the brawling brutes
Where’s Sami?
1:24 Roman laughs
Roman be looking shook when Drew's music hits
I don't support cheaters
WARGAMES!!!!!
so sami zayn got erased?
McIntyre with The Brawling Brutes is a cool team
Sadly we don't have William regal to say WARGAMES!!!!
Last one will be KO i bet
Wtf is this why didn’t they show the rest of it
Only people who didn’t come from TikTok are allowed of liking this.
So it's already Warnight? Not fight night.
WAR GAMES!!!
War games!!!!!
War games match 🤔🤔
Let the games begin.  ......it's gonna be uceey at survival series.......🔥
Solo Sikoa is Roman Reings' sincere bodyguard who dares to stand up to protect and confront Drew McIntyre.
Oh
Reigns, Sikoa, Usos, Zayn vs McIntyre, Sheamus, Brutes, Owens. WarGames!
It wouldn't be wargames without this
WARGAMES!
Where’s sami
Where is Regal to scream WAR GAMES
One of the most interesting endings in SmackDown history, I’m sure it means WAR GAMES
Lmfaoooo Roman laugh 1:24
That was entertaining to watch!!! The bloodline getting the hell kicked out of them!!! Welcome to the Jungle boys
The Brawling Brutes & Drew McIntyre vs the Bloodline at Survivor Series Wargames 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Drew and Brawling Brutes vs Bloodline at WarGames make it happen Triple H
Out of the loop here but where's Sammy at? Are they keeping him out so that they don't break character.
They shouldn't cut off the brawl
Roman thought the mic wasn't working was so hilarious  😂😂😂
Imagine sheamus beating Roman and brutes beats the usos
McIntyre never gets boring man! And Sheamus is definitely a legend!
There's only one place: WARGAMES
Bloodline and Honorary Uce Sami vs The Brawling Brutes, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens. Calling It. This match about to be a banger of a century 🙌🔥
Roman Reigns
I hope we get Sheamus vs Roman Reigns for the Undisputed championship in the future, it would be a banger, exactly how Sheamus likes it!
Romans knows his job on the mic
Tbh Cesaro returning would've been better.
That annoying little tween, Sami Zayn's BOUND to be in the production truck pissing about with Sheamus' microphone. 😒
The Usos Solo Sikoa.
Roman Reigns: Everybody is acknowledge me Drew Mcintyre: I'M  NOT FINISHED WITH YOU!!!!
Either Roman was going to acknowledge The Usos, or he was going to call out The Rock. We'll see in the future, But for now It's Wargames!!!!
Ummm so afterwards were they feeling very usey?
What a rough wedding night, a fractured elbow? damn !!!
We just need KO to join WARGAMES!!!
Damn maybe Sheamus is stronger then Reigns and Lesnar
buzz kills!
Never thought this would happen.
Broo when is Triple H gonna give Sikoa a title and make them complete the Bloodline
I love this team of Drew and the Brawling Brutes. Now bring in Wade Barrett as the 5th man with Sami and the Bloodline.
You know what, I wanna hear HHH say WARGAMES for this feud
This is epic
So, let me guess, after the WARGAMES, Sheamus is the next one in the line for the Undisputed Universal Champion
I'm calling it. This is gonna setup a Wargames match at Survivor Series. The Bloodline vs Drew, The Brutes, And 1 more partner to join them. And it's great to see Sheamus back and he didn't come alone. He brought an old friend too and that's Drew. What a rivalry those two had from last year to this year, but now, it's great to see them reunited together.
I hope to see this at Wargames and not Roman vs Drew again.
I am very excited for WarGames. That would be insane. Plus, Congra sheamus on the wedding.
This WAR GAMES will be interesting
WOA-GAIMS!!!
Where's karrion Kross? Just gave up on him again?
Wtf is that with Sheamus's mic Please bring KO back for this feud Nevermind Mcintyre is a great addition for this Wargames
"He didn‘t hear him!"
Wow , the chaos everywhere on Friday Night Smackdown 🔥
You can't even get the mic to work  😭😂🫣😂
WARGAMES
Good to see Sheamus back. And they got a score to settle with the Bloodline. And the Brawling Brutes have backup. And this isn't a brawl, this is war.
where is sami zyan
Inb4 someone from the Bloodline ends up on the receiving end of a Brogue Claymore Sandwich...
10 Years of the Tribal Chief Head of the Table since he made his debut
Super showdown
Roman Reigns gives his greatness to Jey and Jimmy Uso in 0:01. Sheamus is back along with Butch and Ridge Holland (Brawling Brutes) in 0:23 and 0:47. Sheamus confronts Roman about ending the Bloodline in 1:16. All hell broke loose in 1:43. Drew McIntyre joins the fight in 2:10. 😎👏.
Roman Carried the show as usual Roman’s been carrying wrestling on his back for years now.
If Sami joins The Bloodline, who's going to be the fifth member of the other team?
The bloodline vs brawling Bruise
Ten fighters. Two teams of five. In two rings. In one giant cage. Ladies and gentlemen, I know exactly where this is going….                   *WARGAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
