lallana is an english legend
If Brighton won it would have brighten-ded up my day
lol Idiot Vardy could have thrown the game with that dive. Maybe next time stay upright and get the ball into the box you fanny.
Tielemans 😍🥵🔥
Love the double piggyback Iheanacho and Soyuncu jumping on Amartey
I always said Tielemans was under rated. He’s proven my point with that pass.
A short story Thank you Leicester from a Newcastle fan The end

2:17 disgusting
Ndidi has had many mistakes of late.
La masia player's never lose class
Wheres the cheering coming from?
Liverpool  need LALANA now...............
Leeds might end up getting Ben White for cheap the way they are going
whoever sees this may your mum live for 100 years
the ball from tielemans and then finnish from ihenacho 🔥
OMG
Where is Moder?
I think we know that the penalty shout would have been given in certain Premiership games - and we all know who would have benefitted from it.
Pause at 2:18 ... I know he's bloody but fast no way Jamie Vardy should be getting to that ball first lmao... Dunk is even slower than Harry Maguire ffs and that's saying something. Embarrassing.
Sanchenz is good he just messed up 😁 Graham might get sacked this is coming from a Tottenham fan Leicester are going to champions 😁 😷😷😷💩💩💩
Wish they had kept a camera on Tielemans face when that exquisite no look pass came to fruition 🤗
Tavares will be a baller
Spent 60 seconds opening and closing the video so I didn't have to sit through unskippable ads. Time well spent.
Vardy with his normal kick out dive
penalty
Happy for Lallana that he got his first goal for Brighton, a good career ruined by injuries, just like mine. completely!
The fact is that var is scuffed
How the hell wasn't that a penalty when he didn't touch the ball?
Lallana is on fire
Brighton  lucky again. Should have lost by more. Definitely a penalty.  Brighton forgot to go in there Falling over in the penalty area when losing mode.
That was a pen 😡
Fofana doesnt look fit... His socks were rolled down
Iheanacho is so underrated it’s unbelievable
Hope Roger Sanchez gets "Another Chance" to play after missing that corner
If it isn't a penalty to vardy then it has to be a dive. This VAR thing is a absolute shambles doesn't actually help at all
Tavares is gonna be some player, he looked so positive whenever he had the ball, and that connection was gorgeous
How United let Leicester get Tielemans I don't know 😅🤔🧐😂💯🔥👊🙈
Brighton is the weirdest team in the league. They always give a good performance but constantly drop points
Keep it going Leicester!
The assist from tielemans, no look😬
Nobody likes Leicester
defo penalty but still won 2-1 so ill take it
Tielemans top top player Lcfc will do to hold onto him - he should have been snapped up before joining Leicester as to me was class already - top European clubs missed out and will now have to pay millions
Ronaldinho like pass from tielemans.🔥🙌🙌
1:37 that tielemans pass though.... 😳😳😳 goosebumps 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
As a city Fan. always happy to see Iheanacho score.
Amartery was so grateful for his goal he took a bow as it went in
IN YOUR FACE BRIGHTON! Cost me a fortune in bets recently
That penalty claim would have been the main talking point had the Brighton keeper not made his error.
I swear leicester just played like the day before yesterday
0:17 punch to the face 😂😂😂
Cheers Daniel you just won me £83 spondools. Woo-hoo!
My brother had 4 other results come in for him early on in the day he was needing Leicester to win for him to win 174 pound from a five pound bet and he did he fair play bro
Great for an equaliser
I'm a utd fan
Ndidi just not good enough on the ball
The match that lallana and amartey score after a very long time
Yeah
Okay, so Sanchez had a 'mare for the second goal, but who the hell was picking up Amartey?
Brighton are a joke of a club
Who else got goosebumps when lallana scored
Tielemens is massively underrated
Only  first  I josh  crazy  me in school  tomorrow
And that's how a goalie can throw away 2 points. He's been so good as well. Maybe starting to believe his hype and getting carried away there
When I saw a young player called Tavares playing I thought I was watching a career mode 5 years in
Packed What if  Pereria, absolutely gutted
How is the top comment not about how Jamie Vardy didn't get a penalty.
The most undeserved win of the season
Should never have let Matt Ryan go on loan to Arsenal!
Big up Daniel Amartey tbf, he was in great form showing what a quality player he was & it was a shame when he had his big injury, nice to see that he's doing it again 👍
"VAR "CAR for Gunners?
Smarter is doing well covering in the positions he has, RB, CB, DM, CM I didn't rate him but he's showing it be a good cover option
Ileana hi in top form
I hate Brighton
Genuinely forgot lallana existed
Brighton have been so unlucky this season, Lallana had a brilliant game tonight too
I thought Leicester City going back to their position 5th but good win at the end
Both teams played very well
That first Leicester goal is actually beautiful, no look fantastic pass by Tielemans, cool composed chip finish the unexpected side of the keeper... oh my
Cheeky no look from Tielemans
-in bed   -not in full screen   - reading comments   -if I’m right, u owe me a follow bro 😎   -don’t ignore
What a perfect tackle Lewis dunk
U20 winning in the final amartey scoring and eyew scoring on Independence Day🇬🇭
this is a terrible corrupt referee, this is also the idiot who booked Forestieri for diving, even when the player for Hull admitted pulling him down, he should never referee another game.
I’m sorry but a player just simply isn’t underrated if 60% of comments are about underrated and class he is. He’s just very good. And everyone knows it
I still can’t believe that is not a penalty VAR is so inconsistent
Liverpool fan here, I miss lallana
Unpopular opinion: tielemens is the most underrated player in the league
So happy for Iheanacho so underated
Vardy not been his usual self since Christmas
Leicester beat the litte boys wait next season leeds leeds leeds.
Bruno better den all u stupid prats
If I were Cengiz Under I would go back to Roma immediately, as his talent is not appreciated.
1:41 Lewis Dunk knew he scored 😂😂😂
Iheanacho is so underated
Ogs remember tielemans 94 potential on fifa 15
Th4 state of that by the keeper
Why not timer and scoreboard?? They did it for like 2 games then it buggered off again
I think with good recruitment in the summer Brighton could get top 10 next season. Potter is a really good manager, they play nice football but just don't have the players that will get them where he wants his team.
You won me £74 ya beauty
sky could you not please spoil the title for those who don't know what happened.
Happy independence day Mr Amartey, sealed with a goal
Big win for Leicester. Sheff utd next at home and expect them to win. Well on their way back to Champions League football next season 👌
1:37
Imagine if salah went down like vardy did 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
Ihenacho playing type of football he was when he was at city, get that goal scoring form back they  could be a real force with vards upfront along side him
THAT Youri pass 😍😍
Brighton are probably top of the xG league aren't they they 😂 Honestly if a top 6 side got Potter they'd get top 4 or challenge for the league every year with his football
Like how Ianacho is moving silent⚽😶 atm, very happy for him 🙌🏿.
Crazy thing is if Brighton converted 20% of the chances they had they’d probably be in the top six! They are so wasteful in front of goal! 😅
Brighton will be playing against Barnet again before long hahaha 😭😭🤣🤣
fair play to Youri. Absolutely terrible first 55ish minutes. then really turned it up.
What a gobshite goalkeeper,threw away the game,lucky Leicester.
Amartey was a baller back in career mode
Thank you amartey winning me £100
we won ugly but that’s a sign of a quality side. tavares is a future star, iheanacho is on fire and i’m so happy for amartey but that dunk challenge was a penalty for me. he didn’t get enough of the ball and too much of the player
Love to see Iheanacho getting in the scoresheet again.
Definite penalty... Var must have been at the bar... Deserved win.
what a pass from tielemens
Petition for sky to ban arjan Patel
In my opinion Sanchez was fouled
I thought Leicester were going to bottle top 4 but I think this win tonight will be huge if they can get players back for the bigger games coming up after international break 😬
tielemans put some respect on his name.
Ianacho is underrated
Amartey scores on Ghana’s Independence Day 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Lallana could’ve had a hat trick!!
Thank goodness we won lol
Lol way the guy saw the goal In while On floor
WHAT A GOAL FROM THOMAS PARTEY TO WIN IT LATE
Lallana celebrated too quick
Ice cold composure by Ihenacho. Maybe he'll reach his potential yet.
Leicester got away with it. Will not finish in top 4, cannot play out from the back and again, I lost count the number of times they actually passed the ball to the opposition.  Suicidal tactics. Top sides will take them apart.
Brighton could start a game with a 5 goal head start and would still lose around the 90th minute.
Still gonna bottle top 4 though
Hopefully Leicester keep this up and don't bottle their top four hopes like last season. They were in the top 3 for most of the season, only to miss out on the final day. I want to see Everton finish in the top four too. That would be great
Brighton play really nice football but I wonder if they will regret parting ways with Hughton by the end of the season?
Sidnei Tavares remember the name 🔥
Brighton are the worst best team in the league.
Jamie Vardy is having Amartey
Brighton were unlucky not to win this
They win but they don’t keep a clean sheet that’s my ricardo going down
That Vardy dive would be a 10 on “strictly come diving”
brighton who ????????? foxes never quit
That Tielemans pass was gorgeous...
Anyone heard from the Graham Potter fanclub lately?
How was that not a pen on Dunk
Just like my brother brighton just cant finish their dinner
I won 890 pound from a quid thanks to the last goal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No one on the back post!
Ooft thought Brighton where going to get the 3 points
Brighton’s goal was like a Sunday league goal lmao
Had Leicester on an accumulator so I'm delighted
I believe Karma is paying a visit to Brighton's chairman who sacked the previous manager, who got them promoted, and said, 'I want a new manager to take Brighton in a different direction.' I believe he's about to get his wish and that Brighton are soon to go back from whence they came - the Championship.
Kelechi Iheanacho has been doing quite well for Leicester.  Good game, good goal from the young lad.
That Tielemans no-look pass was dirty!
Armartey, what a rí 🤴
Liverpool not gonna qualify for champs league.
Brighton must be one of the most frustrating teams to support right now. So much effort for little or nothing every week.
Well after we didn't get a stonewall penalty we deserved the second goal...
Well Leicester are running away from Chelsea
Iheanacho backed in to the keeper. That's obstruction.
I REALLY FEEL FOR BRIGHTON THEY ARE PLAYING GOOD FOOTBALL BUT IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING FOR THEM LET'S HOPE THEY WON'T GO DOWN
That Tielemans pass was beautiful.
That no look pass by yori tho 🤯
Should Tielemans start for Belgium at Euro 2021? I think yes.
Tielemens with that no look pass 🤯
Superb Leicester FC performance.  2/1 underdogs my foot. 🤣
The Foxes baited, waited and then pounced on the Seagulls.. like a true predator! Well done lads. 👍
Leicester are such a good team
What a pass Tieleman Dont watch me watch tv
Super Sanchez Save *Got Enough Alliteration there m8?*
Leicester in the champions league would  make me vomit, nah i am joking, very impressed with Brendan rogers performance this season and last with what was initially classified as mid table quality players
That no-look through ball from Tielemens tho 😍
Tielemans criminally underrated
Brighton have to be the most unlucky team this season
Will be dissapoited if Brighton go down they play great football but individual mistakes always costing them, robbed by Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and now Leicester. It's looking like relegation now and Fulham 16th
Can we give credit to Maupay for the assist I know he's a penalty merchant but that's good skill to have the composure to find the pass and the strength to hold off the defenders
as a leicester fan I wanna say we've probs been the luckiest this season and I feel bad for Brighton who have probably been the unluckiest
Won me my bet, I love you amartey
Holy Moly!!!!!!
Holy!!!
Tavares (number 50 for Leicester) looks like he could be a good talent
Such a shame this Leicester lost some silly games.. they would had been right up there with the rich buy all boys.
Amartey played against liverpool and man city We won both those games coincidence I think not
That assist to iheanacho 😑
If only arsenal could of done the same
Another poor decision by the referees, luckily Leicester won to save them from being slaughtered yet again
We are so fucked against city tomorrow.🙁😭
have a good day!
that Tielemans was absolutely beautiful
Who agrees the ars v bur and this highlights are longer than usual extra replays
Iheanacho!!!
Should've had a Pen too but Michael Oliver and Stuart Atwell went fully blind again and didn't give it.
Tielemans' little nervous shake of the hand after his assist is adorable :')
Arsenal fan here. Leicester are a great team. I hope they finish second in the league and then go on to do well in the UCL next season.
The fact that tielemens is still going strong without a rest all season is impressive. An underated player for sure
Leicester this season: we suck at corners Daniel amartey: hold my beer
18 seconds and gross gets left hook to face....should been a red
The dislikes are Brighton fans😭
👍👍
Who ever is reading this god bless you and your family x
Just need everton and west ham to get their fingers out and get that 3 rd and 4th spot 👍
Sloppy out the back today same vs Burnley but great turnaround and iheanacho is becoming my favourite player
Sanchez brings me Leno vibes against Chelsea when he didn't get the ball which led to Jorginho scoring
I’m so glad Amarty and Lallana scored. It will really boost their confidence
1:38 no look by tielemans👀
0:50 yep the technique is great good shot unlucky not to score good save
Iheanacho is underrated..
poor brighton :(
this was such a huge win  psychological  win for leicester
VAR are corrupt, that was a pen
Ayoooooo
ffs this keeps on happening to us and tired of it, see ya sussex im off to man city edit: im joking xd
I hate supporting brighton. Classic today.
Leicester likes to win the game quite late.
That no look assist from Tielamans is beautiful
Poor Potter needs a good striker
That youri tielemans pass to kelechi iheanacho for the goal 💥  And great to see Daniel Amarty on his first goal in 4 years.
I’m so glad I haven’t seen arjan Patel on here today and if he comes on everyone make fake accounts to hate on his video
IMO Leicester getting 2nd this season would be a similar achievement to them winning the league. I thought it was just a special season but to stay at that level without spending loads would be terrific
Leicetser fans: DANIEL AMARTEY YESSSSSS  OTHERS: WHO IS THIS GUY
MGH was right all along
0:45, man if that went in...
Ugh. Hate Leicester
🦊
Day 16 of trying to get famous in the comments
Earlt
Third
Maddison starting for the euros?
What do Brighton even offer the premier league anymore, every week they play a boring brand of football and lose
Vote lingard potm ⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
I'm so glad Amarty scored he really needed that to boost his confidence COYF
Great to see Adam Lallana back👏
If You See This Have A Nice Day
