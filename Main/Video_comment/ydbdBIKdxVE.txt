blud dont talk
This is my favorite emote and I’m about to get it in 3 days
If u put the speed to 2x it kinda sounds funny
I can't wait for this emote to come back again, I really want it and I missed it because I wasn't playing Fortnite at the time
Ever time i hear this emote I want to punch the skin in the face
I hit the Quan I was 8 when that came out (2015 )
I love it
Best emote
what skin is that
*causally has 18k v bucks*
I got this emote
This is basicly the new outwest...
Look at those vbucks
write
Ngl emote big cringe
fortnite runs out of ideas for emotes solution : tiktok
Holyyy CRAP EVERYMODE I GO INTO THIS EMOTE IS SO OVER USED LOLLL ITS SO ANYOING BRUHHZZ I Don’t like it that’s why I didn’t buy it
This is why I left. 🤦‍♂️
At this point they're just putting different songs on the same tiktok moves, big oofs. indeed!
Worst icon emote it don't even make since
Another reason why I do not play this shit show of a game
im so glad i stopped playing this game holy shit
Man, I regret spending so much on this game. Had I known they were going to override it with cringe-worthy tiktok dances..
This is so fucking cringe🥴🥴🥴
cringe
Rubbish music can't lie
What’s the link to the song
Kill me
Hi can you add me
Why did I think the song was corvette when the music wasn’t playing
I didn't notice it was hit the quan
what the hell
Y love you pls gift me this im so sad id marty_prinses
Nothing new tiktok emotes on Saturday
Na, I collect icon series cosmetics but this might have to be a drop
no thanks lol i'm tired of these cringy rap emotes
This is the shittest song I have ever heard
Never heard that song, and i wish i never did
People actually like this brav. Something is seriously wrong with people or me in that sense.
Dissapointing music
Dissapointing music
I’m getting it but that soon kinda ummm
And thats why i quitted fortnite 😂
Oh I can't wait to see people use this in every game...😒
When he doesn’t get copyrighted 🤣
When I saw name I just thought   hIt Or MiSs I gUeSs  ThEy NeVeR mIsS HUH   When I saw emote I hated it
Hi this is my first video I watched on your channel.
I hoped for a better music because I like the moves
Ehhhh
Epic games please give me back my sanity...
I used to do this dance  with my friend infront of the whole class + teacher 😔
I'm.. Just confused are you?
This is absolute dogshxt idgaf
save the world died for this?
BUT IT SAID A NAUGHTY WORD 😳 😈
Bro it sounds so weird without the end
They forgot to add hit da quan .-.
Bruh im not a fan of this emote 😂😂
tbh the song doesn't fit the dance
I want this emote
What you should do is when your about to open it try reacting to it with your voice so we can get a reaction
I remember doing this exact dance on my TikTok LOL
This is so stupid and is PURE CRINGE, HOW ABOUT ADD GOKU AND VEGETA SKINS FOR ONCE
Ray gettin’ that money
why cant there be something good for once like why cant we get a good classic song not a new song or any other stuped tik tok song all there is a stupid tik tok song i want a classic song like michal jackson or what ever classic song that is good not this what ever this song its  dum if you ask me.
if anyone wants to gift me the new hit it emote my epic is KieWarby242 😂
I mean this emote ain’t bad
Wow yet another trap emote, also looks like Renegade emote zzz
Damn RAY go crazy
Please record ur reaction with the video 😭
Haven’t heard that song in a while
song ?
I mean the song is fire but it’s such a throw back I was surprised it was added
Ok I thought the music would be a lot cooler. WAY WORSE then I expected
song¿???
It’s the song hit the Quan emote
Very old song but it nice
Damn that shit got moves
i love the fact that he isnt even using his own creator code!
My guy is really out here coping I talk or I talk fortnite like bro why do you do me like that
THIS IS THE BEST WHOOOOO
Yo that kinda fire 🔥
I want Beatbox instead
Hit the Quan
Best tiktok emote realesed
I was thinking a few months back if this would ever become a fortnite emote
Thought the next one was Corvette Corvette
I would cop the the xxxtentacion set just like Travis and a concert
What the skin
I really hate these rap emotes, oh well
This snippet of the song for the emote is horrible in my opinion, I really dislike it. A LOT.
How do you not get demonized
Can you gift me
It's horrible
To be honest I think Fortnite might be going a little to far. Mostly cause of music wise and all cause I mean there are a lot of different dances that might be more liked than ones like this.
Hit the quan is now in fortnite, but we don't hear the words hit the quan):
Dice roll makes the dance better
I hate tiktok emotes
I bought it using your code
this is cringe asf what is epic thinking? oh yeah $$$
Hey itf❗ we need your reaction with the music too right here❗💖💖💖
...             Catchy :]
u should include your reaction, cause we don't get to see it on the item shop video, I watch your item shop videos to see how u react to what we got lol
At least it isnt the same mumble autotune rap
At this point they're just putting different songs on the same tiktok moves, big oofs.
Copy right my guy
Fortnite wah you doin
Winner.
Annoying but cool
ᴼⁿˡʸ ᵖᵒᵍᵍᵉʳˢ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᵉᵍᵉⁿᵈˢ ʷᶦˡˡ ˡᶦᵏᵉ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ
Oh shit this slaps tf
Wait your name does it stand for I talk fortnite?
ITF.....I talk creater code
I'm soooo bored of this type music i swear   Can we have rock? Damn.
I was waiting for the hit the quan part 😔
What the name of the dance song
ig ray really likes her new body
Trash
No.
Thats a pretty cool emote, I was amazed to hear that it was "Hit the Quan". I remember that song.
Locket this sounds like NF
I kinda of wish they would of include him actually saying "hit the quan "
Hit the quan
They really left out the best bit of the song smh
They really left out “I think I got a winner”. The best part😭
Ah hell nah
I would love if they made a icon series emote for nf
Ngl this emote is next to Savage, Chicken Wing it, Wanna See Me.                    On how bad it is.
🤮
I thought it was Corvette when it was the dolphin move
Robo Ray absolutely looks like she feels very comfortable in her new body😂😂
Wow this sucks
It's a cop for me  Love the emote I think best icon dance yet
I thought this was corvette corvette by the movements
I talk please add you reaction to it please
Thanks. I hate it.
I respect the creator for the song and the effort they put into the emote... but it's not my vibe man. It's too fast and just not understandable... not my type of music but it seems like the majority enjoy it, so.... my rating is like 4/10 for me boss.
i knew ittttttttt
I- wh- ...no comment...
Holy fuck I actually love this.
The song is kinda bad just sounds like a bunch of screaming😂
This emote is wack.
I hate this with a passion
Wtf
Broo this song brought back so many memories
Oh noice
why can't they put the song name in there
We really going back to 2016 with hit the quan, aren't we? That's awesome!🤣🤣🤣
I wouldn't mind TikTok emotes if A) TikTok was good B) The music was good C) It wasn't another shitty wannabe rap song
It would be cool to hear your thoughts of the emote after hearing the music too
Fortnite when they see other battle royals games.
omg when will they stop with the trash songs i kinda want them to go back to stealing the movement with new original music
Nice moves but not a good song in my opinion
Yo
Hi
it has dice roll lets gooo
Na
This song sucks, one of the most generic songs ever imo
wow
Yooooooo
Yuck this emote sucks come on Fortnite your losing your great emotes too now!!
Omg it's Hit the Quan
HIT THE QUAN!
Hit the quan
Here from I talk
🤔
This is a vile disgusting thing that should not exist
Wwwwwwwwww
Ssshhhheeeessshhhh
What the f is this emote
Ah I see the devs at Epic have found their children's phones again...
Something is seriously wrong with epic really hit the quan 😂
I think that this emote is from a popular song and not tik tok just like marshmallow
😔tik tok man
This is the worst icon series emote yet.
Lol its 😈
I kept refreshing my notifications until I saw ITF post this new TikTok emote video lol.
Just cringe
Hmmmm
Nice!
oh
Hi
lol im too poor to buy it
I mean it ight
Lol YUHH
Great job on your main channel and second channel videos keep it up
On this channel can you also show your reaction to hearing the emote?
cringe
I'm so lost on the song... Hm
Imagine he hearts this 😳
Omg this is weird yet I love it! They at least could have added the other part of the song the way they cut it off really annoys me but its whatever
Hope this channel remains as ITF
Nice
I always wanted an emote that did the dice roll since ch2 s4
I lost my mind when I heard that it was Hit The Quan
I can't tell if these songs for the emotes are getting better or worse
finally i'm one of the first 100 lmao
They did everything BUT hit the quan
