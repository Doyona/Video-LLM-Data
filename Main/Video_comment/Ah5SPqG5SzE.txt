I know I look different - head over to my twitch if you wanna know more about it (I had a nose job woop lol) if u hate it I don’t care so don’t bother commenting :) mean comments will be deleted and let’s keep the comments about the video plssss❤️❤️
I really do hope that she does a apartment tour for her new flat
Wow it’s beautiful
She lives right next to me lol about 1mins walk
I just clocked tgat these apartments are where Jesse Lingard’s staying for his time at West Ham, check his Insta
Your voice is so regal and the tone is very nice
U and Natasha stay Same in one apartment building
Beautiful!!
Is that Westfield in white city or Shepherd’s Bush
And she’s moving again...
Who’s here after she’s moving out of this apartment
Those windows are so nice but soooo fucking scary 😭😭
Why do you always keep moving tho why don’t you just wanna sit in one flat for a while and be settled I don’t understand
It’s so strange every one in the uk and a lot of the sidemen like viks place talk about how small the places are for the money you have to pay for them but talias places are always so big and roomy
damn. talia with short pink hair looks hella fire xD
Am I the only one who really wants to know if she rents this or has bought it?
Bruh her apartment is way better than Simon's and JJ's
This apartment cost £2.25 million 😱😱
Why don’t you move in with Simon ??
Annnnnnnd.... she’s moving again 😂
Shes gonna move again trust me 🤣
Hey talia .. since you got a new house can I get your sister ?
Crazy to think that she's already moving again
H
whos the other female in the vid other than Italia and frey....
The only reason she moved was cause she found out that Simon was cheating on her with JJ
This place is madddd
The apartment is so cool 😍 I wonder if I'll be able to have like that one day..
How does talia live nicer than Simon
JJEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!
Well what’s the next house gonna be like
is Frey the one that's filming Talia
Wtf talia living like Bruce Wayne 🤣🤣 when I say her front room I was lost
looks fucking sick tbh
Wait does Natalia ocèane live in the same building as her?
Why does she look so different wtf
She reminds me of the girl in lazy town
Ohhhhh my god. I would love to live in there!!!!! So much space it looks like. Woooow. And the view!!
oh my god i love itttttt
Omg, I know exactly where you live because I was looking into this place a few months ago myself lol.  Pretty sure its the same one. I was looking into the 27th floor but it was worth like 2 mil so it was well over my budget.. Won't say where it is obviously for privacy reasons but yeah very nice place and location. CONGRATS!!
You remind me of a singer. I’m not really used to it. But it fits you. Hope you dont get hate and keep it up!
But the other one .... the colour scheme and decoration ... you have to do it all again ... oof. It’s nicer tho well done
Tbh Simon's wall is more textured than talia Mar's make up
She hella rich bruv. This loft is by Stratford and that’s like the 5th Avenue of New York...
I love how it is nicer than Simon and JJ's
8:31 that gives me so much anxiety
can you film an full apartment now?
That flats huge and nice and in London and no flat mates gonna leave a dint in the wallet
My favourite youtubers girlfriend is rich check

When’s Simon gonna grow up and move in with his gf?
I was wondering why you looked so different and I thought you were going to make a video about it.
She looks different
Honestly as some who loves real estate this is an incredibly designed apartment, so cool!
Guys im not gonna lie... this place is just a tiny bit mad
This is actually one of the best apartment designs i've ever saw
The kitchen/living room looks like my mine craft house I built when I was 12
Damm you look amazing not that you didn't already lol
Why’s is the extractor and hob not aligned
that view is mad
I want a heart from Taila, can it happen? Please
Nicer than simons in my opinion
make simon cook for you
Nice Sidemen tatoo
KSI took ur man
why the walls built like minecraft im sorry i had ttooooo haha
that's so freakin highhhh
Now that is probably the best appartment out of the others I have seen...
Also loving the new apartment and the views 😍 can't wait to see you decorate!!
ur amazing:)
11:37 yo I actually thought she said “furniture and drugs and stuff”
This place is soooo nice
Hey Talia, Ik you've got twitch and stuff but bring the videos back bc they are amazing, bc you are a great youtuber :) also need more music!!!!!
I am so confused, did Simon buy it and now he gonna live with Talia? Cuz I can’t believe that Talia made enough for such sick apartment
You eat poo

Miss PlGGY
Ms. Piggy
Why Talia??? Why Ms. PlGGY??
Looking like a PlG lol...... wtf Simon aka Kermit the FROG
Jo

Actually speaking deli looks better than you!!🤣🤣
I love how Talia is always changing her style and look
Love the house talia
When are u going to live together with simon ?
Interracial relationship and I find talia
I know it's been a while but can you do an updated makeup look that you wear every day? Btw your so pretty <3
Is Simon moving in with you
"Gotta do the cooking by the book!" (Sorry, its just the hair, nothing personal)
What happen to her 👃
Looks so sick tho
Watching your stream right now and seeing you flirt with another guy while you have a bf its disgusting. you are clearly a golddigger and i feel sorry for simon to have you
Ok, but where is her skirt from? It’s really pretty
Why don’t u live with Simon
Drinking game: Every time they say cupboard you have to take a shot
Simon probaably gonna move too
Talia you look great! What does Simon think of it lol
You’re sister is such a beauty
Geeeeeezzzzzzzzzz
Talia looks like that pink hair chick from lazy town
Could u do a singing video singing the song I see red by everybody loves an outlaw because I love your voice and I think the song would go great with it
It's like the sidemens but yours is cleaner🤣
simon so lucky
i would kill for a flat like this 🔥🔥 so sick
How much did it cost
so good (hi from macedonia) IMGAy
yo this flat is PENG!!
she looks so different
Q&A with sis?
Dude, that kitchen/living room is absolutely ridiculous. What in the fuck, that is one of the coolest designs I've seen.
wait did talia and simon spilt?
SIMON IS CHEATING ON YOU WITH HIS BFF
Don’t want to be mean but you look so different don’t know why you look like a stranger to me
This apartment is so peng ❤️
So simon moved in with jj
You suck as a YouTuber
sucking off simons fame  worked well for you!!! never see someone less interested in her bf then you.
It’s actually mad to think she has the p’s to pay for this and doctors and nurses could never even get close🙃
The only problem is groceries how are you gonna get those up there
Simon is eating well damn..
i dont want to hate but a few months of rent on this place and you could probably put a deposit down on a house... :/
Tell your fucking fans to hop off the sidemens dick
apartment looks like it costs bare p
I love you
Wait didn’t Simon move with her?
U PUT PANS AND POTS IN THE DISHWASHER u hand wash them and put playes and Bowles knives and forks in the dishwasher
she doesn’t even look like herself like i wouldn’t recognise her ... and i’ve been following her for years omg
Why do I have a funny feeling that Talia is tricking us ?
what a unique wall on the outside
Talia Been making pees
She moved out because of JJ's screaming innit?
Talia remimds me of tje girl from lazy town
See looks completely like a different person
That must have cost soooo much...
I thought  you live with Simon
Did u get plastic surgery? Look different
Why don’t you live with Simon
Just saying.  Talia must be making p'sssss now off twitch
Most of the sidemen fans watch her...but incase there are any original talia fans here..just know that harry doesn't give a flying fuck if you cancel him or not🤣
what about you and simon                                                                            :(
The girl who filmed this is jj's girl
Pink haired tosser
Simon knows how to choose
"iev been gone for two months" Me - who has been playing fall guys all the time then?
Yo, your stans trying to cancel Harold.
U sharing the house with Simon ?
To see apartments like that is amazing. Work, believe and you will achieve. Well done Talia!
Imagine a hide and seek here
Make more videos with simon
When did you get your hair dyed pink
Where’s Simon
i would like to move in with you🙂
something about you looks different (obvs the hair 😂) but something else 🤔
Watching video, but not looking at the apartment too much🤭
she moved because Simon and JJ lol
Did her and Simon break up?
You are literally perfect inside and out..... Hope u see this comment😣😣
Congrats for 700k
I live near her...
You really know you’re getting old when things like the cupboard under the sink and the huge fridge/freezer gets you excited hahaha
wheres simon
So this is what twitch gets you, apartment is lit
Feel sorry for Simon. Gf went from a 10 to a 6
Can’t wait for Simon to move and they make more content together. What a pair 🙏
Why dosn’t Simon live there
You should make a group channel with all the sidemen girlfriends and call it something like 'the sidechics'
Gold digger
Talia *THAT PINK HAIRRRR* it looks SO PRETTYYY on YOUUUU!!! Im so happy for u and just remember. We are here for u at anytime anywhere. So if something is bothering u, share it to someone, not to us if u r not feeling to. Sharing something makes a person feel less burden and not heavy in their heart. Love u and u r my inspiration!
Is anyone else feeling cold for talia while watching this l.
Why do I know where this apartment might be 🤣🤣🤣 I've been living in London for too long
She looks like a dbd skin
Oh so you live Stratford  ps I live in new Zealand and I know were you live
When are you and Simon going to live together
What are you gonna move in with Simon
only the "chea" was missing from this english video
Imagine looking for the fridge
Ppl seriously comparing this with Simon and jj...their house is bigger and they both can buy their own massive mansions if they want lol
how much bank she be making 🤑😂😂
Anyone else jealous
Talia Harper
What happened with Simon
Why does she look different ?
£7000pcm a month business must be good!
Only clicked the video cause you're looking cute as hell lol.
Talia should live stream her building the bed and tables and stuff
Oh dear lord.... the architect that designed that apartment should not have a job anymore
Talia I love soooo much😍😍💜💜 your my Queen. I loved the apartment sooo much btw And the hair
That living room view is mad
I thought you lived with JJ and Simon
rip SIMON' I MEAN TAILIA LET KSI AND SIMON DO THEIR THING
Looks like a completely diff girl
She moves and changed her looks more than anyone I’ve ever seen
Y have u moved out with Simon
This is how many cupboards are in Talia's house 👇 👇
Nearly at 700k come in Talia we can do it
Since when does Freya have a fringe
@taliamar rule 1 of apartment tours. Close the blinds. You've baited the fact u live near Westfield, it won't be hard to find your building. You may have building security but I doubt you have bodyguards once you leave the building. Proof how easy it is to get address: the sidemens last house was in Orpington, JJ and Simon, who close their apartment blinds whenever they film, currently live at centre point near Tottenham Court Road.
I typed Empty to get Juice Wrlds song and this is the top video 😂😂😂
Holy F*** - that apartment is amazing!! o.O
enjoy your new flat i hope you spend your best times there with people you love
my best girl wowowo
you're looking gorgeous omg
Not being rude but ur the women Michael Jackson
Is this really talia? The face is really different
The bathrooms bigger than the bedroom yikes
WTF... What happened to her face....
got so pissed living with jj and her bf so moved
Can't wait to see what Simon thinks about  the new apartment!
9:21 Josh is used to hearing that from her.
Is only me or Talia looks different
she rented it or bought it?
Can someone pls tell me has Simon nd tarlia broken up
your apartment has got such a beautiful view😍
zzzzzzzzzzzz
Forget the apartment but who’s that fine girl in the white crop top 😏🥰
Why do i feel like JJ is the type of person to buy a more expensive and bigger apartment for him and Simon to one up Talia
i dread to think how much that costs lol
Ngl after the tour i thought freya and taila were gonna get down to business
Beginning of th video: yeah it's alright  Shows the living room: yes this is my dream house
With this hair colour u look like toxic nea😂😂
"ooooh, she boujeeeee" *harmonizes*
Jesus Christ the living rooms a madness
Who is she?
Congrats on the new apartment! But pls do a boom mic audio with some echo proving next time 😅
No one :  Camerawoman: GEEEZ
Talia moves out: Thinks Simon will be sad and depressed     Simon: Happy cause now he can fuck JJ wherever he wants
Has talia and Simon broke up is that why she got a new apartment
Is it me or are their a lot of doors😂
9:02 did anyone recognise the football pitch
Talia is extremely underrated. Even her just playing games is entertaining
Congrats on the new apartment 💪🏿👊🏿💯
That's actually insane! GG's Talia
699k subs!!!!! hahahha
Simons a lucky guy
Omg your flat is so nice!😍 x
Simon simped hard on this one lol
We want to know how much it was
She still with Simon?!
Didn’t she just do up her apartment and now she’s got a new one 🤯
You look like one of the robots in better than us. Your  hair is so perfect.
Ily
699 thousand subs, if you know you know
Wasn’t she living with simon though????
anyone else love the apartment but hate how the kitchen/dining room is like a triangle, that'll be hard to design is all i'm saying
If Talia's moved out them when's the Simon breakup vid coming out
Remember Stephanie from LazyTown? This is her now.
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that this isn’t talia
The view at night tho 😍😍
Why's she moved out from Simon?
That apartment is huge
when are the  music vids coming? that place sounds like it has such good acoustics in it.  you the guitar and your voice, gonna sound goooood doood
i love her sm
You look so dofferent
is simen going to move in  with you at some point?
Can I please live in your fridge.
Does anyone else think she looks different...just me ok
Looks like she's living like shes making mills. wtf how
Cograts Talia, really nice place.
8:41 freyas voice 🤣
WHAT HAPPENED TO SIMON
I thought she was staying with Simon?
talia is pregnant oof
that's a sick house
It's actually upset me how I know I'll never be able to live this life like no matter how hard I try this will never be me. 🥺
i think the apartment could do with some more cupboards 🤣❤️
there are automatic diswashers?
Omg that view be mad
Simon?
Anyone else think that her new apartment is nicer than Simon and JJ's?
F@ck! Your content is like watching a turd weasel nibble on a particularly large brown trout.
I would love to live in such a house😣😭
Is simon moving in
So when is Simon moving in
ok this apartment is sick
where does she get all this money from lmao
Beautifull appartement!! Happy for you!
Always said I’d shag the lass out of lazy town 😍
How did she afford that. Simon?
wait so what abt simon????????//
thats where i would like to live
Dang your apartment is so nice Talia!!
omg love the kitchen
I always wondered what happened to the lazy town girl. Now I know.
How come you and Simon don’t move in together
Is Simon moving in with her or did they break up or is she just moving to her own apartment
We wanted simon to be part of this video
I’m not gonna lie, your house looks like its from the year 2050 or something 😂
Talia this is sick if you are happy then we are
I’m jealous
So Simon rather lives with JJ than with his hot girlfriend in a nice apartment.
when is she gonna move in with simon
Wonder when tali’s and Simon will actually live together
Now Simon and JJ will be able to have “fun” together with out getting interrupted (if you know you know 😂🤣)
The views from the windows are absolutely gorgeous.
She have a secret only fans or something where’s she getting this p got damn
Mad
Wait, so you did break up over those chocolates then?
Lovely appartment. But why does every appartment in England look the same. Light wooden floor and then everything white and simple.
I actually thought she was a different person ngl
Why don’t you just live with simon
What about Simon?
Hello my friends, I don’t know who reads my comment, but I wish him eternal happiness. I wish you to subscribe to my channel and activate the bell. This is all I hope. Thank you.
how can she have a better place than jj and simon....??
Lol the fridge is like a normal American size
Kill them with your success, bury them with your smile
I dont mean to sound invasive; but around how much does that apartment cost? Im asking simply because it looks amazing and Im curious how much an apartment like yours would cost me. I apologize if this comes off as intrusive or rude, and congrats on the move!
I want to grow up and live here one day
That view is mad!
fucking hell right next to Westfield I wonder how much it costs u I'm assuming u are renting it?
SHE LOOKS GORGEOUS
Bruh my butt clenched when you opened the window
Aren't you going to move in with Simon
them views tho!! 😍😍👌
I loveeee it 😍 but how is the patio bigger than the lounge room area 😂 andddd I would be so scared that a bird would come in through one of the windows and never be able to get back out hahaha
I hope you know your face was gorgeous before you did it but I mean do what ever makes you happy in life
🤣
We can see your bra
9:51 just saying simon would've had the time of his life seeing that if u know what i mean
I want to live there omg 😍😍
This is the dopest apartment in London
*How much does this woman make*
Why did she not continue living with Simon and jj?
oh. my. god.
The big question is is Ksi staying there
Bruh  Your making money
Couldn’t work out why Talia looked different in Simons video. Now I know
How much is this to rent per month?
Stop moving mate
when Talia goes from a 10 to a 10
these twenty second ads are pushing it youtube
damn talia living gooooooood
I only hope my future looks like this wowee
This is a nice house you know.
Fun fact: both of your bathrooms are called bathroom pods. Made in Germany. Pretty interesting but very boring!
9:37:  Youtube: Copywritten
How much is Simon paying her Jesus. Guess jj must be worth it.
Can you guys stop being so nosy let her live omg Love u xx💖💫💫
Just out of curiosity. Does anyone know what the price would be to rent/buy an apartment like this. Just wondering because it looks like something I would like to live in one day :)
Wonder if you gave in and bought that couch you wanted lol
this is where you are going to live when you leave Simon for Freya
I'm sure the place is luxurious and expensive, but it just looks impractical
Talia: I need content Talia: Yes I have an idea I’m moving
Simon defo put money to help talia for this aparment
cool. no more screaming simon.
Does Simon not live with her?
Only one question wtf are the ceilings so high
Simon should move in so the jj Simon memes stop , like if u agree
she lives not far from wembley
Lookin like some Minecraft house
**^Mum walks in 0:03 Mum: what is this bs
Why didn't you and Simon just move in together?
that pink hair pops out and it looks SICK
So this is where our donations on your twitch has gone 😂👍
9:23 what every man wants to hear from a woman
me just being excited during the whole tour :D Congrats Talia this place is beautiful!
It
This is pretty i love
Not only do you look like a SIut.. . You look like Peppa The PlG now..........Wtf why would you do that to yourself??
I think Westfield gives it all away
I'm going to  manage site, and mเ,ในเรื่องราวในเรื่อง
Who are you?
9:52 I can see my house lol.
why doesn’t she live with simon. it’s kinda odd
Why have u left Simon?
No Simon? 🥺
Is she still with Simon
Omg that night view is amazing, it could be a really cool computer lock screen 😂
I've been so excited for this since you were getting excited over the windows on twitch 😂  I wish you all the best in your new place, it looks amazing!
Anyone else got champions league vibes when Talia turned off the lights? 😂
Frey!!!
That onlyfans money doing good for her🤩
Hey everyone look at me and how much better my stuff and my life is than yours.  You are part of the reason kids feel insecure and poor, shame on you
i want your apartment!
Josh’s personality must be hiding in one of those cupboards.
Did Simon kick you out because he’s dating JJ?
Can we get a Simon reaction of apartment
Simon?
😂😂
Wait a minute,first let me start off by saying This apartment is Cool and Talia deserves it but what about the Young Minter Is he moving as well with u? Cause If he won't that might damage ur Realationship with him.
This was the coolest apartment I have seen which is not like the other extremes and insanely high prices like the nyc ones
I point you in the centre with jj and Simon tower
Why don’t you live with Simon
Is that STRATFORD?
Did Simon move with you?
trending #8
HOW MUCH COULD THIS HAVE COST
Sidemen money🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ smh😂
WIFI OVEN twitch gang
6:49 this is how you know you made it in life
no living with simon?
I can’t believe ur moving again. Feels like you just finished the streaming wall in ur current place. Btw, my OCD could never live in that new apartment sorry. Everything’s crooked! Hope everything goes quickly and smoothly.
why did she leave simon?
Manhattan Loft Gardens. Don’t tell me how I found out where she lives......
Your Peng
She had a glow up
Bet simon is jealous.
Why aren't you and Simon living together
This level of wealth, and for what? Dating a D-list Youtuber? We live in dark times.
Is it just me who watches these and think “you can poop whenever you want and not worry about anyone hearing you” 😂 I’m sorry goodbye
The mandem are gonna reverse engineer your address from the scenery
You rich bruv?
I'm just waiting for the video that will say that shes moving in the Simon.
I love your music so much! 20 reasons and get gone are my favourites!!
You will eventually hate that spiny thing. Coming from experience they eventually get annoying with stuff falling
Don't get me wrong its a nice place. its a weird shaped place lol
How much is a apartment like this?
Your Apartment is 50x better than Simon's. You also have to do a tour once you have sorted it out
I kinda really want to live there.......im 15...... not even legal lol
Apartment tour no simon living with her still
Look like daisy ridley now
Nosejob??
You remind of Lisa from blackpink with that hair style😍
💤
Damn nice place
talia looks way different
this seems bad for young impressionable people
Big shoutout to Talia for rocking Callux's 'Notoways' shoes
So this is what a life looks like when you're privileged.
The little cupboard can be for the diamond play button😂 all jokes  aside it’s a beautiful place and you’ve done well for yourself!
I knew somit changed about talia jus read her comment and all I’m saying is wow tha apartment is amazing
sooooooooo        ksi and simon alone wink wink

Me when I see this vid no 7 on trending 🥺🥺
THIS IS INCREDIBLE OMG! CONGRATULATIONS!!💕💕
Me: sees title  Also me: OMG MAYBE SHES LIVING NEAR ME

Clearly simon didn’t want her getting in the way of him and JJ
No more simon
1:46 what does she actually say
Cool
Soo u finally forced out to leave simon and jj 🤣 they were annoying
9 on trending yay
Are you still with Simon
I desperately want her to sing over there cause it’s so echoey
I’m obsessed with the window shapeeeeeeee
Will simon move in???
You changed
Talia: "on to my favourite thing"  Also Talia: "ok, on to my favourite thing"
perfect timelapse balcony. it would be lit if you would be like a female English Casey neistat timelapse person thingy
I thought she said she was moving in with Simon maybe I'm just an idiot?
Didn’t she move in with simon ?
That kitchen will be sick at nighttime Pog.
I was gonna say it looks like a standard apartment in london which is sick BUT THEN I SAW 4:00 GIRL
i didnt even recognise her but recognised the voice, my brain couldnt work it out, whats different?
Fall guys is the best game
I know you don’t do pranks but can you start doing pranks on Simon !
Jesus christ Talia your living the DREAM 🙈
Umm.. Idc what ya'll say this girl is not Talia. Who tf is this? Looks totally different.

Nice, congratulations ✨✨
Her house is hugeeeee. Kinda jealous ngl but im happy for her
take a shot every “geeees”
Is it just me or does Talia look different and sound different
London is a third world shithole
Shouldn’t Simon be moving in with her he’s 27 now
To the person who is reading this :  You are amazing stay blessed stay safe and have a wonderful day
Why the title wasn't "New face. New place".
Good decision
Are u still with Simon?
Of course u would say the washing machine is the best part
The only reason she moved was cause she found out that Simon was cheating on her with JJ
oh hey! I've got boobs! you bought me this apartment so also please buy me some furniture, in case you forgot, Boobs!
One of the cupboards defo has her strapon collection
Jelly appreciation
Imagine a games night in the living room 😂
absolutely no one: talia: another cupboard
Why is this 8th in trending
Can I just say this is way nicer than simons and JJs
It's not bad but she looks different
Prick

this is such a beautiful apartment! im so jealous, the makeup bench idea seems amazing and i can't wait to see it when its finished, i looks like a great place to host a  NYE part with those views!
Why do you not live with Simon ?
There’s not much storage space. It needs a few cupboards
I don’t get it is she still living with Simon ?
Talia’s sister is kinda cute
She gives me "Charlotte" Vibes for some reason.
that is a mental flat
It’s bloody massive 😂
i got such bad anxiety when you opened the window
Where is this???
Simon gonna live jj for you??
that kitchen looks insane, im acc so jealous
I kept looking at Talia like she looks different. Beautiful either  way 💕 (I don’t simp)
I no longer need my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
She looks different
when someone else is living your dream
U did not move. Simon wanted some privacy with JJ
You look great

I almost got struck by lightning near talias house
Why do you not live at simon’s?

She doesn't look like Talia

Nostrils = cocaine?
Very upper class
OOOOMMMMGGGGG THIS APARTMENT IS SO DOPE TALIA!!!
She’s had enough of JJ’s screams

Can someone count how many times Freya said JeeeeeeeeeeZ
Wtf she looks so much more different

a small flat in london is already ridiculously expensive so i bet this place is soooo pricey!!
That must cost a ridiculous amount.
Fuckin jj

I'm so excited about this moving vlogs

What about Simon (Miniminter)?
It’s soo pretty wow

Can we talk about the fact she's 7 on trending 🤯
She looks unrecognisable (not saying its a bad thing) just so different
So this is where all the money from simon went...
We need a yoga videooo 👍👍👍
Wish I was rich man
trying to watch tv on a sunny day in that living room would be aids
Is this north west south or east London???
Talia look like a Talia lookalike
Talia be living the dream 😂
Is Simon moving in?
Great apartment but why does the living room looks like a minecraft-build walls.
that little area where she gonna put a dining table nd makeup stuff, would be sick to have a projector onto that wall 8:22
course her faviourite would be a mirror
Simons paying her good
Do talia change her hair or something?
her apartment looks sick! can’t wait till its fully furnished😍🤩❤️
beautiful apartment but living room look abit small
Wowwwww this apartment is insanee
please make a channel called the sidewomen
I hate the wooden finish on everything, but the flat itself is amazing. I'd be in a constant state of vertigo that high up lol
Jheez Talia doing mad moves out here. them lofts be expensive AF. You get that bread girl!
If this was Simon he would of done a MTV Cribs style tour.
When Simon moving in
She litterally just finished decorating her other flat
Am I the only one that thinks that her hair is so cool? love it Talia
Talia be looking like the girl from lazy town
I keep looking at her face like she's a different person.
When will Simon and talia move in TOGETHER
not hate but why,you looked so much cute before
arctic monkeys
That living room is whammmmm
Why is her apartment nicer than Simon and jjs
I literally know the name of the apartment lol. I have passed by it many times before
why does she look different not in a bad way but still
if she went ham on this channel she would easily have 1 mill by then end of the year
Pretty sure Talia moves just so she has content
her twitch aint a clickeable link in the description
9:22 that’s what she said
Why not just live with Simon and jj instead of having simon pay for this place
She must make bags
I didn’t expect the living room is so big lmao
*Moves away from simon and jj*           Ksimon lives on❤️❤️❤️
Innit all London apartments look the same
okay talia, if you leave this place youll be the dumbest person to ever live and then if you and simon want to move in together make him move here :)
Has Simeon moved?
the architecture of this house is SICKKK!!
No more livin w/simon🥺
Bro that fridge🥶
Why does she not live with Simon?
I LOVED THIS VIDEO SO MUCH!!! YOURE FUCKING GLOWING MY QUEEN! If anyone has anything to say then they can get fucked because at the end of the day it’s your face and you’re life. You do what makes you happy and you’re still gorgeous! You can see that you’re just so genuinely content and happy. I’m proud of you baby g!!! ❤️❤️
Probably the strangest shaped flat I’ve seen lol, but it looks so modern and nice 👍🏼. Good choice 👏🏼👏🏼
aye  talia i see you in west london you live about 10 mins away from me haha
is this tailia? im confused
At 1:44 what did she say, it got super echo
Bruh dis apartment seems better than jj and Simons
i need a apartment like this in my life
Ok shes getting that TWITCH MONEY
Storage 😍 btw is it ideal to keep blinds closed even if your several floors high?
Damn ur so fit and have got a lovely personality, mini meter is one lucky lad
Talia giving us that Stephanie from Lazy Town look 👌
I wonder what this apartment costs so lucky
Omg this is actually such a nice apartment , THAT LIVING ROOM IS MAD
looks like a museum
hella sick pad
✨Lets get talia to 1 mil ✨
Talia with that hair reminds me of that girl of lazy town 😂
Did u break up with Simon
Yo what about simon ?
Banging vid
Is it just me or does her face look a bit different
Can't wait for Simon to move in there
I can already imagine Talia forgetting in which cupboard she kept her stuff in...
Is she moving in with Simon
Jesus
Its like a spy house  When u open cupboard boom fridge
Oh my gosh! I, sadly, haven't been keeping up with your videos. But, your hair makes you look SO DIFFERENT!!! I could barely recognise you! I love it though
....I want... that place 😳
The view ❤️, also the living room is sick!
Your apartment sounds like a museum
My favorite part the washing we loved that
All the storage is for the US army😂
Where’s Simon living
Talia is such a great person
Also why is it obvious  where she lives?
Fucjin hell, she renting that place solo, she makin mad money
Me: mum, can we have champion?  Mum: no, we already have champion at home  Champion at home: *fila*
i thought simon had a nice apartment
She already looked good but damn she went from a 9 to an 11
Must've been a good deal or you are absolutely loaded. Fair play
My parents literally wash there hands with that temperatures water
The apartment is really nice but it just has small amount of space to put thing and furniture
2:01 me every day thinking about life and death
Why does she look so different???
It's a shame Simon amd talia don't live together
This makes me so excited for the day I get my own apartment and film an apartment tour!!
R u moving in with simon
Nobody:  Not A Single Soul:  Literally No one:  Talia: FoR tHe PaST YeAr AnD A HaLf
this flat is like a maze
There is something different about her face?
Talia: This is the bedroom Freya: Where all the action happens Talia: This is the stream room Freya: Where all the magic happens
Nice
omg love the new place, looks so cool and classy and will be so good once furnished. Can't wait for the rest of the moving vlogs.

Is it me or Simon has a lot of gfs
What about Simon
Dat view is soooo sick
Is Simon moving in with you
Is jj going to be in the new house
You know you're old when you start getting hyped over kitchens🤣
For all the people saying she's a golddigger:   This apartment's bigger than Simons and she's making money moves. Respect her.
I’m so excited to see what you do with the new appartment! 😍 really enjoyed the old appartment decorating videos
talia you look amazing
penthouse tings
I thought talia was living with simon and jj have they split up or something
It's a nice place but the whole place is windows I like my privacy
If a thief ever comes he's gonna have a tough time opening all the cupboards.
Iam so happy for u Talia u look so beautiful
N why freya sound like she's getting fuck when talia press the thing then it had something pull up in the kitchen
Vlog it when your things already there pls
That apartment so weird shaping, it barely spacy n it dangerous that is such a weird apartment I would die in there
Nobody:                                        Literally no one:        Talia:👌🏻
Her kitchen is part transformers
What about Simon ?
Omg I wish I could have a place like that it looks amazing
Her apartment is fucking amazingggggg how much is the rent😭😭😭

I thought u were moving in with Simon and JJ
The way talia walks😍😍
I just dont get why waste money when u can move in w simon
UPDATED TOUR WHEN FULLY DONE PLS
Disliking the video bc you said you put ketchup in the fridge
Of course they get gass for the kitchen 🙎🙎          Joking btw don't cry 😂
Is it just me or does talia look different.
Umm how much did this cost!?!?!?!?
Talia i hope you dont get stuck in the washing machine
That’s not an apartment, that’s just a room of cupboards
OMG I LOVE IT😍😍😍
It looks like Lux and Simons apartment mixed
I cant even imagine how expensive this apartment is. I respect it
Is it just me her face features looks different🤔
for 1 person this is massive!
why does she look so different
This is amazing!! She definitely made the right kinds of moves to get to where she is now in her career!! Such a queen ♡♡♡ I've been watching her since her very first video & never stopped. It's sooo cool to see where she ended up *as of now*. Now, she just needs to make more tunes I can jam out to in my shower♡♡♡♡♡ THANK YOU TALIA FOR TEACHING ME HOW TO REEEEALLY DO MY MAKEUP & TO ☆JUST DO THE DAMN THING☆ WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT HAIRSTYLE. All the love, you deserve this!! PS: my martain hoodie is worn to death🖤
Right il see you next week when she moves again
W ab Simon x
Fam Wut Talia’s apartment makes simons look  like just... wow Talia well done honestly. Like the view is kind of mad yk.
had to put my glasses on when i clicked onto the video, not dissing just didn’t expect it
Why
Is Simon going to live there with you eventually
I don’t think you guys understand how fucking expensive that must be. Apartments in London are fucking costly anyway, AND SHE’S RENTING HALF THE BLOODY BUILDING.
What’s the elephant in the room? I’ve listened to her say it a handful of times and can’t figure it out to save my life lol
She looks a bit like Saoirse
Yab i want to live with you
N is Simon gna live there aswell
Your new place lacks storage
the LIVING ROOM IS STUNNING
I mean my grandfather was an architect I’ve seen some awesome apartment designs but this has got to be the most unique apartments I’ve ever seen  Big up talia Made in life
Is Simon moving in with you?
SIMON IS A NONCE
I wouldn't be surprised if Simon moves in with her
Jheez I didn't know she had money like that damnnn
No wonder Simon's been doing so many brand deals recently
Well Angèle Is more tanned than I remember
I’m legit living vicariously through this vid the apartment is gorg😍 also that hair is itttttt
Hey merry was the afternoon of time for you guys to join us for the next year round of us we are going back and then I’ll go see the new trader joe soon and I’ll try it to get all together and I’ll see if I can see you tomorrow
This looks like a porno
Bruh. Talia's apartment is way better than Simon's and JJ's. You definitely have more money then them. Like imagine living here. I think Simon would want to move in
Like if Simon should move in
I don't need anymore my work because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
you living in the burj khalifa or somin
Your sister is stunning! Is she single?🥵👀
Could anyone tell me how much an apartment just  like this would cost in London/just a rough estimate
How is Simon and Talia not living together yet O.o
Ha u do realise that’s a Karen’s classic haircut but in pink
So she doesn’t live with Simon anymore?
This place is so nice omg
If i were you i would never want to move again
I wanna know what the price for this apartment is
Looks a bit like eathens flat
How much ?
Flex
Is Simon and JJ gonna live there
Except for the people unironically sucking talia off  This is the best most original comment section with the least 4 year olds  Big up talia fans
Instead of moving houses move in with Simon already
I’m so proud of talia, this apartment is practically a dream 😍
Wait am i the only one that think talia look different not in bad way
The rent on this must be $$$$$$$$$$$
am i watching lazy town?
Wait wait why does she look so different? Like her whole face has changed
that's a gorgeous place to live.. so excited for u <33  btw, can simon fit the bathtub?
Talia, you look beautiful as always! I hope you have a great day
I need this apartment or the YouTube money to get an apartment like this god damn!!
But do you see Simon living there with you?
i can only imagine living in a flat like this
Is that taila....
10:49 some guy went behind the pillar thing who's that
10:49 WHOS THAT
Twitch money came in clutch 💯💪🏽
Yo, that is the coolest apartment iv'e ever seen....
9:21 that's what she said
Why she not living with Simon
I saw the space around the kitchen and was like WTH THATS LIKE MY WHOLE HOUSE
Mate that kitchen wtf. That’s outrageously nice
Talia to 700K let’s GO!!!!!!
Don’t worry talia, we love you no matter what😀🤗
Can you do a follow up video once it’s all finished and decorated?
First 10 seconds I thought I was on the wrong website 😅
Where’s talia got this money doe

JESUCRISTONUESTROSEÑOR I swear you are so extremely gorgeous
Did they breakup ? And she moved away?

That view is just to good you deserve it
Simon should move in
this apartment must have been a pain in the ass to build
Damn that is a sick apartment. Love the views and you deserve it so much❤️
Such a beautiful house I’m so jealous
I can guarantee you are going to bump into that kitchen counter when you walk in
*super nice kitchen, bed room, bathroom,*    Talia: excited about the ice maker and dryer
She rich rich
Can't wait for simon to help you out again😅
TALIAMARHOME IS COMINF BACK FROM THE DEAD

QUEENNNN THIS IS SO EXCITING the apartment at night oh my goddddd (also your outfit BANGS)
That’s nice man 🥶

Your new apartment looks so nice. You deserve this. Keep up with the great content 💕
I'm sorry Talia but it was very easy to find your apartment...... It's infront of wesfields in stratford, triangel shaped apartment near the railways...............
Will u be living with Simon
Simon and ksi will be there soon
*OMG pls do a cover or write a song or something as a video or vlog singing before you furnish the apartment, the echoes will be insaneeeeee 😭♥️👌🏼💕😍😍😍😍😍😍😍*
Just me or tali’s look different ( to about her hair)
Did she get a noise job
I have to say it , but she looks like the pink haired girl from Lazy Town
All her expressions,learned them from simon....
Can you do videos of you decorating your house, I love interior design videos!
She live near Westfield
She lefted becasue of JJ
This is the minecraft house you made when you were 9 that was a triangle that was filled with mostly chests
Soo pretyyyyyyyyy, can’t wait to get my own apartment!!
This apartment is better than any house ive been in. Although i do live in maine so not much to choose from
She looks like the girl from lazy town😂😂🤣
Talia get a hot water tap so it’s a tap but it has boiling water from it best thing( just watched the part with that tap) 🤣🤣
The new place looks so good
The extractor not being inline with the hob stresses me out
Couldn’t manage to look at the property at all sorry 😳🤣
Damnn the layout and shape of the apartment is so sick, gonna be soooo nice when its furnisheddd!xxxx
Why have they put the extractor fan not in line with the Hobb 😂
why are you sooo pretty 🥺💘
Talia let me hit
I really wanna be rich now
i swear to god that looks like jj's first apartment (the one where harry nearly got pnuemonia on)
I love the way in her last 4 videos she has had 4 different hairstyles😂, all which I love 💛
Let's not forget about the camera women👏, world class.
Move in with Simon already wtf
That tiny cupboard can be for Simon and that’s it 😂💕
What does she say at 1:44
Did you and Simon break up?
I can live through Talia as she decorates?? Yes please!! I’m in love😍
She is not living with Simon??
talia out here in a better apartment the simon
Daaaaamn did not know she had this much bank to afford a place like this
Why do you look so different???👃🏽👃🏽
Is it just me or is the structure and base of the apartment really impractical i.e the tall cupboards and the diagonal shape of the living room
I just love how how Simon and josh gf’s are friends like them
move in with simon
This sounded like a white girl private snapchat story
Your apartment is three times as big and five times as posh as simons, who shares it with jj, one of the most popular youtubers of all time, who has nearly 5 million monthly listeners and has had professional boxing matches, thats actually CRAZY, I assume its thanks to all the modelling you do?
That view though 😍
I don't like it I'm afraid. But happy for you
Fun fact: I’m moving into the fridge
I want to move in
damn that streaming money do be nice
Is Simon gonna live with you?
YouTube getting too comfortable With these 30 second ad
You look soooooo different omg i loved the old talia look i had a crush on old Talia but why do you kinda look familiar...
Talia pls do some singing in the echo-y rooms , I bet it would sound even more amazing than you usually do ✨
What about Simon
your apartment looks sooo sick it must have taken you ages to find this one
the flat over all is meh but the terrance is awesome the living room im not a fan of
that apartment is ace
Can I replace Simon?
Sold out in 63 seconds
I think that this flat is where willne used to live
Fam i need to talk with the arcitect of this building, what is this i wouldnt live here ever its...just not me
Bro is anyone gonna talk about how different she looks? No? Just me?
Talia is making bangers
When are you moving in with Simon?
She baited her location soo harddd u can see the Westfield outside the window
Only reason watch her video is coz Simon needs the money
How much does the rent roughly cost for an apartment like this ?
Dont lie you came for the chebs
Please don’t go to her flat people even if you can work out where she lives leave her to her privacy! We are all entitled to this.
I was like “yeah it seems like a nice place”. Then gets to the kitchen and lounge “holy fuck that’s expensive”
That apartment looks fire. Next time I’m asking talia to pick my my house and decor she got good taste
Have you moved out from simon
Her living room/kitchen is bigger than my house ahahahaha xx
talia i loved the video but don’t u think it might have been a gd idea to furnish ur new apartment before doing a video 😭😊
I imagine this to be the house Simon joins
Wait she doesn’t live with Simon oh no what’s going on
i didn’t even know she was moving !!! she should have said LOL
Tali’s looking 🔥 the flat looking 🔥 can’t wait to see it fully finished
This appartment is fire i would live here the rest of my life and its a really good place to give parties
Just move in with Simon
Ewwwwww wearing shoes indoors CRINGE
Talia I just wanted to say you look SOOO BEAUTIFUL, and engore everyone else bs there obviously blind. Love you and your content ❤️❤️
Tbh I prefer the old flat
The big question rent or buy my moneys on rent
Great video! No joke I’ve used the same background music you used in the bath clip for my GCSE media studies opening scene 😂
I. Am. Jealous
What about Simon "miniminter "
Does she have an only fans because Idk how tf she payed for penthouse looking ass apartment
In my dreams
Ur rich
TALIA! You're boooooogiiieee
Ok Well After This Simon And Talia are gonna upload consistently
She looks like a completely different person
Love seeing you upload again talia ❤️❤️ was really missing your videos
Literally when talia said her twitch I got her twitch notification 😂😂😂
She looks so different 😱😱 I didn’t even recognise her at first. So pretty 🥰
Ngl she looked way better before she had plastic surgery
You look so pretty talia🤍🎀x
Why she look different
Rahh stream money coming in clutch i think it nicer than jjs and simons from what i have seen of theres and not much worse than vikks big boy flat. This actually like my realistic dream flat
Feel sorry for Simon if he gets roped into helping her move all her stuff over from the old flat too the new one
I dont owe anybody anything now thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Do u still live with Simon
Is simon going to live with you now instead of his boyfriend ?
What about simon
It would be hella funny if someone found the address just from looking out the window
Nice apartment
You look so different💙🔥
DAMN THE PINK HAIR AND TOP IS A VIBE!!!!
I don't think I could ever move into a place like that. It would just feel so open because it is basically all windows
OMG I'm so excited for you! the apartment is amazing!!
I mean, this just shows if you keep grinding you can achieve your goals. Big up Talia
Just move in with simon already
This one is certainly not 2k per month lol
What did she say the elephant in the room was I didn’t hear?
Isn't she living with Simon?
Where is simon
Oh my god it’s the girl from lazy town 😂😂
She must have a hell of a lot of money to get an apartment this big in London Edit: thanks for the likes guys means a lot  👍
ALSO SUB TO SIDEMEN ; )
why talia does looks like a  girl in a teen movie who has a bad household and is addicted to drugs
They gave you some Simon cupboards in the kitchen
People saying  she looks different  like motha fukka u aint her boyfriend  ur opinion  is irrelevant  and no one cares bye
Put a hot tub on the balcony pls
She can watch tv and cook
Fucking hell ur rich. Odds on she gives one of us a chance to go to her house and try her cooker
Jesus fok the house design is wierd af
Am i the only one that want's to know how much did it cost u never know maybe in the future i can buy something like that myself 😂😂
17

She should do a video moving in all of her furniture with Simon
Are u living with anyone
Finally uploaded
So she’s not living with simon? 💔
Where is Jj and simon's room
Freya saying “jeeeez” reminds me so much of Josh.
That tiny cupboard in your bedroom would be ideal for a little safe, just a suggestion :)
Talia “on to my favourite thing”  Also talia two minutes later: “okay, on to my favourite thing”
That balcony is gorgeous
She looks like the girl from lazy town
Shout out to Talia all that hard work she has done and now she as an absolutely amazing flat/ apartment

Literally a dream
what about Simon :(
this is a 12 minute video of freya saying "jeeeez"
is simon moving in with her aswell x
This flat is so gorgeous wow
Rookie mistake. You used a few seconds of copyrighted music, which "rightly" entitles some asshats to steal all of your money.
Me and my £0.78p in my account are super jealous but very excited for you and your new adventure. Congrats girl 💛
Please adopt me this apartment is my dream 🥺
JJ probably took Simon from her that's why she moved out
LOVED THIS
Oh my  God,  cutesie/cool pictures on that balcony  is probably what would have sold me on moving into that apartment because damn, you know a good view
Simon : you change your hair so much and i love it cause it makes me feel like i date alot of girls
3:59 okay but why does this look like that glass part of Talia’s house in Minecraft?
no one: Talia: you could lob a baby through there
this is what she's been ranting about on twitter
you should put like christmas decorations in the cupboards in the kitchen that you can’t reach lol
Talk about an upgrade, jeez
9:20 ??
Amazing house🤩❤️!
Ok it's cool but like it looks like the strangest use of space ever
This house is sick AF

Are you with Simon ??
I am soooo in love with your new apartment! Congratulations on everything Talia I am so happy for you and everything you have accomplished this year, I find it so inspiring that you are so independent and you live alone doing your own thing I rate that so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
If I had a kitchen with a view like that, I would actually never cook
You tryna start posting again tho. I reckon reddit vids would do well
Her face looks different.
ITS SOOOO NICE 😍😍😍
Where is her skirt from?
Why’s talia so insecure abt herself
That’s fucking class you must be making p’s
Is it only me who thinks she looks weird in this video?
I have never seen someone get so gassed over a dishwasher 😂😂
Are you and Simon moving in together? xx
Loving the hair gurllllllll. What's the dye name haha
Why is the girl from lazy Town on talia's channel?
Talia is just a copy of Selena Gomez but with less face cheeks!
"the towel holders are hot" *grabs them three times*
No one: Freya: Jheeeeeeeez
This is sickkkkk you can only go up from here can't wait to see the boujie furniture etc.
My first thought... A thunder storm would-be pretty cool from your apartment!
