Kane's passing ability is amazing. The one at 1:52 in the build-up to the first goal got applause from the crowd.
Saka learns from his mistakes, this year england will make it to a semi final... then we'll (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢) knock em out >:)
Even when saka missed pen 2 other England players missed so why abuse for sake only
england beating italy is a brilliant moment since they beat us in the fianl
Saka is my favorite player
English football is now so Woke I`m surprised they didn`t allow Ukraine a charity win🤣😅😆😁
My Goat Saka
if rashford was in the starting line up the would score 6 goals
How is Rashford not on starting eleven?
Saka.
Saka.
5:09 has no one seen Walker’s control on the long pass played to him? Insanely good, in some insanely good moments from all the players I guess
when will they take the captainship from Kane? He's just not star material anymore
How come Ukraine can play and Russia not? 🤔🤔
I got to say I was never  ad but to some people this should be his sorry for the penalty against Italy..  its coming home
Kane is a boyhood Gooner 😉, jokes aside you can tell he genuinely enjoys playing alongside Saka. Those 2 + Rashford = scary hours at the Euros 🔥
Ukraine will soon be Russia anyway
Saka is so strong...
Watch out for this golden boy saka in the next world Cup. We'll done son keep it up and send the world in to a frenzy.🎉
Tbf if you've seen the training vids from Colney Saka makes that shot every time
Yessss I’m English but I still feel sorry for Ukraine
fut5s mp
Saka with a cross on the money.. Then a top bin finish.  🎉🎉  this guy is amazing
Z
And England will still not win the euro
6:28 Yes because it wasn’t sealed at 2-0 in the 90th minute
Please get rid of the Nationwide sponsor throughout the highlights. Or at least put it top left or right. In the way of the action!
I'm surprised Ukraine didn't win....it is usually fixed for them
1st goal was own goal
The Channel 4 pre match punditry was possibly the worst I have ever seen. So woke.
SAKA could be next superstar💪💪🤘🤘
Did they arrive at the stadium by boat lol
Looking through these comments, Saka's career is over before it began. When will us English learn not to overhype our young players
What a blinder!! Saka
Glad we beat Ukraine
Whys everyone gassed over this win it's Ukraine FFS we couldn't lose
Saka shit mate
He looks like a young salah
Lol let them win
cant spell 🇺🇦 without 🇬🇧
Saka come a long way since he could not score from 12 yards.
We should beat Ukraine and, let’s be honest, by more than 2. The drop in quality in the midfield from the XI is dramatic… you can see it with Gallagher’s poor choices, even in this short higher real.  A lot of work to do before the Euros… and we need to start calling up those that are performing, rather than just Gareth’s faves or those who play for the big name clubs.
I have a feeling big clubs will be after saka in the summer, not sure arsenal will be able to hold onto him if big money comes in, all depends on his marketability
Ukraine played really well, the Ukrainian spirit is visible across the world right now, hopefully we will progress to the tournament together as we're now kin United!!!
Saka is miles better then rashford and saka is also better then foden now easy
Saks should be playing 4 nigeria
SAKA IS GOING TO BE ENGLANDS BEST PLAYER EVER    MARK MY WORDS
John 3:16-18    Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God and your souls.
Keep Saka in the England team he is  the ideal partner to Kane or maybe rashford  England has strikers to scare any defence in the world 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Shame he bottled the big penalty that will always show on his history
The same Saka, that so many English fan enjoyed racially abusing. Let's wait till he miss a chance.  Then you see leopard never changes its spot
Not very sporting of the English,  I am surprised they didn't let Ukraine win to show their support for the war.
Future wining team for the next euro , Kane , grealish, Madison, Saka , Jude Bellingham,Declan rice , recce James , stones, Maguire, shaw , ramsdale  .   If all is forgiven Ben white at right back instead of Reece James.
Good to see England continue it's glorious history of victories over the Nazis! Surprised the US did not order the English goals taken away and given to the opponents - after all, they've been given everything else!
Ukraine at war but playing football
Saka is brilliant
Both of these 2 players messed up in European and World cup. So both of them missed their penalties so they could have made history for their country but now its too late.
What a goal Saka by the way.
Trust In Jesus Christ today for all those  watching and not saved, It's the greatest thing you can do in your life. Have you ever thought where you could go when u die or what are the consequences for your sins? Today is the day for salvation as the word of God says in John chapter 3, 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Please believe, please acknowledge you are a sinner.
Delighted for Kane obviously but even as a Spurs supporter of way over 40 years, what a screamer from the great talent Saka is..
Nice one Saka, after what all those twats were saying after that final, you fucking show em boy 👍🏻💪🏻 also never leave arsenal 🙏🏻😂
Eng were rubbish, so slow and boring under southgate with such a brill squad. Saka saved him
Anyone ells Notis the play went downhill with the introduction of Grealish.
https://youtu.be/JdhNWgyGVt4
And what have we won ? 🤔
I thought Ukraine was at war what are they doing playing football shouldn’t they be at home protecting their loved ones .
World class with crappy teams.  Not a trophy in sight!  😅😂
It only takes Saka to miss a penalty and everything is forgotten. Bunch of hypocrites!
As a gooner I am so proud of Saka. He has come a long way and will only get better from here
Saka is some player. Destined to be an England legend.
I feel like England is going to win Euro 2024
Obviously never read the script, and let Ukraine win.
What a goal from saka he his class hope he gets the prem trophey this year and im not a fan of his team but anybody but man city
Such a shame England didn't let then win... Where was greame sourness telling England to do that.
The way Saka has back since that penalty miss is a testimate to the attitude he has. A lot of players would have gone into their shell and disappeared. But he’s got better. This from a spurs fan
It’s all so boring …. All we do is rinse and repeat and run over the likes of Lithuania, Lichtenstein, Montenegro blah blah blah yawwwwwwwwn
You cant hate Saka he seems to nice
What a finish by saka
“He must have practised this 1000s of times” - you don’t get there by luck. Ngu
Bayern, Barca, PSG or Juventus would love to tempt Saka, abroad. He's becoming a VERY special player. *
ENGLAND WILL WIN THE NEXT EUROS.. lol. But I'm certain. Thanks to these commited, skilled players. They're finaly lift another trophy. Trust me. Fans will dance in the street. From Newquay to Newcastle!
James Madison was brilliant, a starter for me any day
may be Nazi Ukrainian dogs will bomb UK?
Apart from the last 10-15 minutes of the first half the game was dull and hard to watch. England had the chance to put the game to bed but failed to do so. 2-0 feels like a win for Ukraine. A repeat of the match against Italy but this time England were lucky to get a clean sheet. It should have been 4/5-0. England were playing in defensive mode. This is on Shitgate.
Suprised no one's crying to let Ukraine win like they did at the euros
What a goal from and by saka ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
I hate how Southgate is so boring with his subs. What's the point in putting on toney for only 10 mins
Imagine kane moved to Arsenal, as a city fan… 👀 👀 👀 👀
Something about Saka but not about British depleted uranium tank ammo in Ukraine - a gift for future generations of Ukrainians. Obviously by gift we mean deformed babies
maguire acting like that header was a pass 🤣
Kane finally scored an Important goal
You were actually allowed to beat Ukan't
WWW
I just can't wait when rashford is back
It's all so simple with Saka. Hollywood it's not. Few fancy tricks, it's a simple swerve or twist just to gain 1 metre to execute his pass or shot. Like with Robben, the defender knows what Sakas going to do but in that split second Saka moves, there is nothing you can do. That goal was a thing of simple beauty.
Wow
England becomes strong when they face Luxemburg, Malta, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Ukraine, North Macedonia. We see true England when they face France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Portugal, Spain. If you want to be the best you have to face the best.
Just lucky that these overpaid prima Donna's aren't fighting in the fantastic Ukrainian military.  The Russians would win in a day while England's "heroes" were drawing their ridiculous salaries and kneeling for diversity.  Useless wastes of space.
People pretending Saka is actually English 😂 😂 😂
Why are England & Italy in a gorup together when some of the other groups are all piss weak?
Don't care, since they started taking a knee for blm I've never watched football again.
I didn't watch the match, do England still take the knee?
It puzzles me how Southgate can pick players like James Maddison who has been terrible all year..Nothing will ever change until we get rid of the manager..Another wasted tournament coming up and I haven’t got much time left to see us win something 😢
Saka and Kane were superb. The whole team was amazing
He`s some boy Saka
saka is incredible,real madrid will come knocking soon
3:22 is where the magic happens. brilliant goal by Saka
How did the commentator say thats Quality from kane, when all he did was stick a foot out and hope? Kane has to be the most over rated striker England has ever had. If you take all his Pens and goals against nobody teams, he has scored about 4 important goals
Saka is a baller 😏
Bellingham (birmingham city fc) zuluz
Thought there was a war going on, you no the one with no video footage
Stop advertising the fake war
Whatever😢
where’s all the ‘foden is better then saka’ clowns??
It is not the English team.they are not all English. They should be called the British Team.
Love the ad 👌
Hi
As someone who has relentlessly hated arsenal for a while, I’m starting to just appreciate how beautiful their players are playing atm and Saka is the best. Fantastic football and an amazing asset to England.
Is there some clause with YouTube sports highlights stating they have to spoil the results in the post’s title description?? They do it with the cricket & NFL all the time to the point I try to avert my eyes 😂😂 it’s not gonna change but it’s poo ???
I went to this game
COYG 💪💪💪😂
Saka & Rashford are being praised now as they score goals. Wait for them to lose crucial penalties/opportunities for the racists and sleeping racist character to be on full show. People (smh).
England football team is a woke disgrace
You have to wonder how long we (Arsenal) are going to be able to hold on to this boy! What a strike! What a player!
Meanwhile in Ukraine they are rounding up Kids and old Men to fight Against Russia! Why aren't  these Players and indeed the Men / Women in the Crowd fighting for Their Country 🤔
Southgate at half time: “right boys were winning it’s time to not do anything second half. Let’s play like crap and park the bus”
That second half was painful to watch💤🛏😴
The skill level of passing is world class and now the goals are coming
The whole second half was the most boring in the history of football.
3:00 - that's an own goal isn't it?!  From that angle doesn't look like Kane touches it
Not being funny but the second half was absolute boring, if we can't see of teams like Ukraine. That game should of been 4 or 5.
Kane diving at the start, what a dick
So sad Ukrainian, bombed by Russian,on top of that a Nigerian Nuke
Thank you saka 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺❤️❤️❤️
Bellingham did one great move on a counterattack during the WC and immediately got commented as  the best midfielder in the world  Now Saka scores one good goal and he's   some amazing player.   I mean, very good performance in each case, and I don't know if it's also because England teams for so long have  underdelivered, but please, stop the hyperbole. He wasn't THAT good. Being over the top is something the English public regularly accuse the media of but reading the comments here they can be just as bad. There's still a way to go before he's a winger at the same level as say Hazard, Robben.  Reason why England are doing well is because they play as a real team, a real unit. And that's what should be appreciated about the current team and setup - they actually seem to understand that this trumps individual skill every time and have managed to go further than the golden generation of the   Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard England with a theoretically inferior team-  and thats what needs celebrating more.
You guys all need to calm down they played against Ukraine..😂😂
Wow, Kane actually ran to the box after passing? Tottenham fans must be fuming
Ukranian football team as bad at their army 😊
Saka is really good! However, the number 11 should have gotten a red card for his Karate drill against the Ukrainian goal keeper. England should have played with 10 men. Even with 10 players, England would have won the match anyway, but let’s be fair, anyone hitting the goal keeper’s cheat with his sole, should have been sent out immediately.
I really do wonder what happens to England during big tournaments. Like we are amazing during friendlies and qualifiers but when it comes down to the tournaments itself we don't perform as well.
Am l missing something, Ukraine is at war, people are being killed on a daily basis, so why are these fit and able Ukrainians in England watching a football match?
Spurs legend switches play to an arsenal legend who plays it back to his spurs legend friend to score and then later gets his own . Spurs and arsenal at thier best as always . Both super clubs with massive winning mentalities . But most importantly best friends of clubs . Beautiful to watch
Anyone else feel like this was a charity game like soccer aid?
Great
Grealish  too     ⚽
Saka ❤
English player very rich need to take poors Ukraines into there house, Mr Southgate’s alsos Gracias
Why is every goal a 'screamer' now?
Pity saka couldn't have done it when it really mattered.
The referee got payed by zelensky with the money he swindled from UK hahahah
HARRY KANE DIDNT SCORE THAT GOAL THAT CAME OFF THE DEFENDERS RIGHT FOOT
Is it me or does this game look rigged af?
How’s Ukraine in the euros 😂😂
Unfortunately he can only kick the ball properly with one foot, which will always place him behind the best
Why they didn’t give the victory for Ukraine,all EU and uncle Baiden support this neofasizm country 😅😅😅😅
Saka is such a talent
That mudryk is defo a steal for 100 million 😂😂😂
Absolutely quality ❤ COYG ♥️
Kane up top with rashford foden saka behind, rice and jude holding would be unstoppable.
I though Ukraine was at war? How they have time to play football is a joke.
Everyone praising Saka and I can guarantee if he missed a penalty again like he did everyone would be calling him shit throwing him racial abuse again!! He is an amazing player and as an Arsenal fan I love the player.  Just hope of something happened again everyone would still love him.
Rashford could learn a lot from Saka
2:35 'the ability to find Saka' 😂 more like the ability to find Kane. The guys don't have a clue
THE ENGLISH ARE VANISHING FROM FOOTBALL TV POLITICS & STREETS & PRAISE THE MUSLIMS BLACKS & INDIANS DAILY LMFAO
Wow. He is bloody special that boy is. Saka I mean.
you can't help but feel that apart from gareth southgate being thick we really would have won the euros
Saka is the future not foden.team should be built around saka.He will help England win a trophy for sure.
Saka is overrated as fuck don’t @ me
Saka wants more..... and he gets one. Amazing goal ! 🙂
England are shit 😂😂
Time to admit Saka is Englands best player not Foden
Thats what you get for taking all our money!
Sad to see another generation of talent getting completely wasted. By keeping this clown of a manager in charge. Pure nepotism is why we never win and have a terrible record again the big countries. Plays Maguire instead of tomori or even smalling. Sterling instead of rashford. Phillips absolutely shocking decision. We need a proper manager Southgate was a shit CB and has proved to be a shit manager a Middlesborough reject. We have the ability to be winning world cups and the euros but we never will so long as this idiots in charge. Barely could hold on against Italy. Only 2-0 against Ukraine…. He’s a nepotistic idiot who should be no where near our England squad.
I heard that Drs up and down the country are putting Anaesthetists out of business by showing patients an England game instead.
Saka came from the Arsenal youth.
Absolutely class act saka is!
Kane/Saka a good combo......maybe Harry will do a Sol Campbell....
Think I'd rather play footy if my country was invaded too.
Kanes goal won me two grand had england to win by harf time thanks kane😂
Play like that against a top team you got no hope. Poor performance
Saka make me fall in love with football again not only the way he plays but also the how he carry himself!
Another 45 minutes of pure quality from our boys.  What's that?  90 minutes?  You sure?  Oh crap!   Will someone please tell Southgate.
Where's rashford?
Should of been five goals
Saka. What a player. Arsenal through and through! ❤️
Sakas goal made me like the video
Saka the future late Pele ⚽  in the wings. The cheers were awesome 👍 What a wonderful personality he has ⚽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
smoke and mirrors for the cattle - look at what is really happening as people pass away in record numbers around you
Im so happy for saka. Its always a bittersweet moment for me when he scores for england. Im always reminded of how fickle many fans are and how they racially abused him when he missed the penalty. Im sure many of them were cheering yesterday.
Saka did nothing against Italy.
Scabby England, Italy will have to fight for second now!
2 Wins Out Of 2?! Great Start!
The question is can they beat real competition like Germany, France, Portugal, Spain etc
Saka played well in world cup yet Southgate took him off . Mistake
acting like saka just scored a 40 yard no look chip LOL
Shouldn’t be any doubt saka plays every game?
I heard about Saka several years before his breakthrough In Arsenal team.    Lots of club staff were talking about this  ‘nice kid, who listened, great energy and straight A student’.  He seemed to have endeared himself to everyone around him. Great role model for kids….keep trying, don’t let your ego get better of you, and you create your own luck by being a good person.
Another defeat for Ukraine
good thing about Saka he plays football no issues with anyone
In year's to come you will see that Putin was protecting this country from the west and NATO the urks was the threat
Bellingham gets better aswell
As an Arsenal fan I'm so happy that Saka made it through the international break uninjured. with Rodri trying to severely injure Oodegard I was terrified for Saka
My ex is Ukrainian, her and her mum both freely admitted that Ukrainians are racist. Specifically towards black people. It's a detail the British media don't like to talk about.
I hope we see more of Maddison and Bellingham together.  Both great creative midfielders.
My starboy saka 🤩🤩
Bring Kane to arsenal
Why do I think saka looks like tobi from sidemen
👏👏 Saka  Amazing Goal 💯🔥
Inagine if kane didnt play for Spurs
Taking the knee causes weak knees - weak knees cause missed penalties.
Saka is great. Why did Southgate take him off v France? i just do not know. .
Kane diving again
A really low tempo game. England on cruise control, but a solid performance. And Kane and Saka team up so well, Kane should come to the Gunners.
Did Mudrick play?? I think Chelsea have been sold a DUD!! 😂😂😂 Thank god he went there instead of coming to us. Trossard has been quality since coming in
Why is it so boring watching England play
When Saka scored the commentator says...  The 21 year old...  It feels like he has been around 21 years playing football ⚽️  !!!!
that saka goal was pure quality
Now that's a screamer for him.
Always love the commenters mate contributing philosophical gold. He's at his best when he's enjoying himself. Pure wisdom.
Now saka needs to prioritise football and to avoid every distraction the smallest thing can make his career end
Saka keeps adding £££ to his value
This is the same player that missed a penalty and was hounded by fans shame on you who know who they are
WHAT A GOAL FROM SAKA AND KANE! WOW TAKE THAT HARLY AT MWS
Saka thinks he's almiron with that strike
We could have absolute gems in our team but with soft Southgate in charge we are gonna win nothing....... that shouldve been 4 or 5 nil
Play rashford
Saka is superb right now
Get him in the gym and bang him upfront!  SAKA'S COLD!!
England's strongest XI: Ramsdale, James, Tomori, Stones, Chilwell, Rice, Bellingham, Foden, Rashford, Kane, Saka
England Win
No excitement from Southgate when Saka scored now if grealish or mount did that the guy would of done a Mourinho and ran up the pitch celebrating racist manager
Unfortunately still not coming home lads. Great win tho👏
Wow saka 👏
I was at the game and my brother missed the saka goal
Crazy how a new England player gets the nickname ‘starboy’ every season
Saka a wonderful talent long may he prosper 🙏
Are England still wearing the pitches out with their KNEES? Have not watched the wokes for years.
That's not good sportsmanship.  Should have let Ukraine win. They need all the support in this trying period. I thought that was the agreement?.
Saka is fast becoming one of the best players in the World 🌎⚽️ (IMO)
Saka is a Gooner ❤️
The issue with England is that they bottle it in major competitions
Peace flag even thought everything but peace is being pushed
Yeah, we all know what to expect with this England team.  Good qualifiers and then an abject and limp performance whenever we meet a decent team in finals.  This team have the resolve of a wet paper bag, stick to taking the knee and other meaningless gestures for your boring PE teacher of a manager
Give Tony chance we all know harry is no 1 u want him and rash 2 be sharp wen dey put the shirt on anything can happen 2 harry I wish him no bad
1:54 2:35 It wasn't even that beautiful
7:06 What a numpty there was no need for that. Man lost the ball tryna look cool and then hurts another player in a poor tackle tryna get it back - flippin 93rd minute
Why is rashford not here?
Saka has finally unlocked that top bins curler, it’s gonna be a long couple of years for full backs 😂
Everyone on about saka...but kane breaking records for our country...kanes the man
Beat the holders ova day and ez work today....never been that confident wiv England until now...we cud actually win this Euro..we can beat anyone...on the planet...
Saka does it again !! 😁
We should be sending players to Ukraine it seems rather than depleted uranium weapons.
Something about left foot belters ❤
Madders was class, the runs he made gave Saka the space for that goal. Shame that when Mount returns from injury he won't get any minutes
Sake was excellent but jude Bellingham for me was just everywhere...at times he looks like he's playing 4 positions at once... he's just an absolute beast of a footballer
How TF did Gareth Southgate not play Maddison throughout the whole World Cup?? He’s one of the only players in that squad who plays and stays in that CAM position. He’s not afraid to grab the ball in the middle and be calm under pressure. He was a breath of fresh air and deserved a goal today. Southgate messed up big time🤦‍♂️
All the racists 🙄
Did the filth get on their knees for their black masters again?
Harry Kane and saka link up is decent. We should bring Harry back to where he belongs…😂
Channel 4 only gets qualifying rounds… go get the Champions League and make it free again
best right winger in the world right now
👍 saka and kane combo no chance against them
2:00 that moment Saka made Mudryk look like a scared little rabbit🐇 To all Chelsea fans: Thank you so very much for hijacking this wasteman Mudryk. U saved Arsenal millions 🤣👍
Missing "that" penalty might have been the best thing for Saka.
Had to catch up on the highlights great game
man im so happy for Saka. He's a textbook example of how to come back from a massive setback after the euros. He's young, hungry, naturally talented and not just that, he's a straight A student. Role model material at its finest. What a person.
Would love to see England win against a big team.  So far on Euros and World cups from last 30 years or so only once. Against Germany on last Euro
Surely it's transphobic to best Ukraine?
Long highlights that's what I like to see.
I might’ve guessed the first bit action I see is a dive from Kane and him having the cheek to complain when he doesn’t get the penalty. Saka on the other hand, brilliant from the lad.
I’ve been say he’s best right mid in world football for long, now you better believe!!
england 2 nazis 0 england "how dare certain european countries dont have enough black players in their team, racists!" also england "we stand with ukraine ( no black players on their team)"
Before he was carrying Arsenal and now he's carrying England Jah light is shining
I was surprised that England didn’t let Ukraine win for symbolic reasons and because they are Ukraine. Also I was hoping to see Zelensky come on 😢
my guy saka🎉
Saka Englands best player.
So when are they going to show this "screamer"?
5:40 gallagher “How the f**k have I missed that”🤣🤣
StarBoi💪🏿
Having seen Saka play his first game for Arsenal, knew instantly he was better than the overhyped Pepe
Keep cheering Ukraine they reason everything is going up in price for is #fookukraine 💩🇺🇦 💩
Beautiful ball from Kane to Saka then from Saka back to Kane beautiful, then the second Outstanding Saka!! Class.
When itv covered the qualifyers they use to show highlight's of the other group games, channel 4 only show the england game , rubbish.😢
Saka's mid-range shots has transform him and it's only a matter of time before he becomes an elite player.
Star boy
wow..... i thought ukraine would have automatically been given the 3 points
Shame we can’t do it when it counts
C4 Focusing on SAKA… I Cannot wonder why … yawn
Im surprised i thought enhland wud give the game to ukraine as gheir are at wwr with russia
Saka is world class
A lot of praise for Saka and rightly so, but it's Jude Bellingham who is  the one who will be England's biggest star in the future.
F all u racist scumbags,  black African saka back to the top ,
Did Ukraine top the world cup qualification group ahead of Portugal without a single loss?
England should of had one red card. Who every hit keeper with his shoes
Good performance by Maddison, nope he plays more in future
Rule no 1.  Don't ever give poor Ukraine a yellow card.
5:44 I agree Connor
Get rid of these useless refs!
Love the hate it’s absolutely beautiful lol
Please don't ever drop maddison from that team
England still shite
Woman’s team would have won the World Cup
Spurs fan but Saka is something special, can only imagine how good he will be over the next few years. Happy to have him playing for England
Just remember all the racism Saka, Rashford and Sancho received from England fans when they missed penalties.  Now everyone loving Saka and Rashford. Classic case of selective racism.
England can score anything but a penalty
We beat them worse than the russians
Today's stadium felt like it was Saka's display show. He didn't disappoint.
Saka has world class potential I'm so glad he's an Arsenal player
What an incredible England team...and Manager
What a goal by Saka.
Okay I’m calling England a good team now…
My main man the big dawg can't mess with this best wing of all time puts the big names to shame they wish they had his humbleness he professionalism he ability and technique and style and played and still does more games than any other winger all ready a fellow gooner legend and the future will only bring him greatness. Coyg the future prem champions. 10 Cup finals to go.
Desperately need to sack Southgate
Saka is the 4th most expensive player on the market in world football for a reason. Our starboy!
🗣YÔö Brûddâ England,  To every Englishman reading this: I Strongly believe that football will soon be coming home, coz its clearly evident on our performance's in these first two qualifiers that our young 🔝Super🌟 studded national team is seriously on job as we say in East London innit.   We crushed the current champions in there own backyard and tonight we clean sheeted a fully decent Ukrainian team innit. We are also lucky to possess 2 of the BEST young players in the world in SAK'S and BELLY. TRA LA LA . .   ENGERLAND
Wow saka lad ❤❤❤ COYG WE LOVE YOU LAD ❤❤❤❤❤
How lovely it was to see 4000 Ukrainians as guests at Wembley...all those Men bouncing.. dancing..n  having a good ol jolly up whilst there country men back in there homestead are fighting n dying to defend an invasion well done👏👏👏👏👏👏W.⚓...s....
England 2 , Neo Naziland 0
Good first half again, awful second half. Southgate needs to alter his plans slightly when we take a lead.
Maguire still a liability
England should stop pretending they like Ukraine, proof is there now
England never manage to sustain or look after players that could potentially be spoken about as GOATS in the future. They always end up ruining them either in the tabloids or just with the number of games they play per season. Wayne Rooney was the closest thing to that IMO England’s best ever player hands down.
What a goal by Saka  keeper had no chance
There were so many replays of Kanes goal I almost missed sakas
How is the Ukraine national team playing competitive football when their country is engaged in a war with Russia! That does make any sense.
Ukraine soon to be russia
Saka is immense.
Kane for Tottenham, Saka for Arsenal. Great to see them supporting each other for the nation!
The England team is amazing... they have won ZERO TROPHY .... LMAO 🤣😅😆😁😄😃😀
That assist by Henderson was definitely the match highlight. Some pass.
SAKAAAAAAAAAAAA THE PHENOMENAL TALENT SUPERSTAR CLUB AND COUNTRY.
Saka; just don't make him in2 Alli or Lingaard cos I'd h8 t c u over8 him as brilliant as he is just t tear him down if he don't live up t UR preconceived ideals. What's up with Southgates views on Rashy? 2wks ago he was media darling of the Yr now caption online reads  *Southgate SLAMS Rashford;* so what's he done wrong?
Saka is just something else, very rarely has a poor game, he's consistently the best player in the prem and he is only going to get better and better. My favourite player at Arsenal.
Just here to inform you messi fangirls that ronaldo now have 122 International goals.... no matter how many Jamaica's Argentina plays messi will NEVER reach him....have a great day 😉😉😂😂 and dont 😭😭😭😭😭😭 too much on your way out 🤣🤣😃😃😃😃
Saka makes me proud to be English and a Gooner, brilliant performance. Too many footballers "dive" at the slightest touch, it spoils the beautiful game.
A load of rubbish
England has all the signs for the cup this time.
really two penalties anyone can see it ,they are mixing everything with war .
Oh why did not let them win? Pity j7st sending wrapons but simple game you dont let them win 😂😂😂😂😂
Did we have to beat Ukraine, shame on you guys
I really thought England was going to allow Ukraine to Win like the EuroVisions.
What an amazing player!  So sad that he was the victim of racist trolls for missing a penalty last year!  Well done you for rising above it and coming back stronger !!!
So lucky to have been there. Great match
🌟 boy
Maddison was class today
Saka place is secured on that right for England now. But on that left you got rashford who prob wins that race, foden, sancho, Sterling, grealish & whoever else is left lol.
Saka has come of age. He still looks 12 but his game is matured.
Well done harry kane for diving trying to get a pen against Ukraine. Cant get much lower than that tbh.
Saka ❤
England very bad at diving these days. They are miles behind other teams, just like top goal scorer is miles lower than other teams too
Now they applaud Saka, they should do that when he needed the most!! Fake ass fans!!
He was role model student, all A’s and first team for arsenal and England. This kid is talented
Honestly. Seeing Saka assist Kane, wearing white with dark blue shorts made me feel sick.
What a fucking game to be at.
Saka has been absolutely phenomenal for our club and country 🌟 star man
Saka is a future Ballon d'Or winner
Honestly this isn't just form. Saka is who he is.
A rather dull game.England reluctant to really play in an adventurous way and settled for caution..Only Madison played freely..Saka was superb first half but went missing in second
Saka is the best winger in the world no debate
Hale end gang 🎉
Yeh they love Saka Rashford Sterling when they are scoring, when they miss penalties thats when they get told to go back to own country 🙄
Saka's goal was blooming brilliant, what a player.
5:44 "How the fuck I missed that"😂😂😂
This is what we need more foreigners to join England.    Fck Trinidad and tobacco
In the World Cup Kane was dropping so deep he started playing almost like a midfielder, which I will never understand why.
Ukraine we all love you ❤❤😊😊😊😊
sakas crosses and shooting is so good
Saka will lead England to a World Cup.
Well done England 🇬🇧 👏 👍 ❤
OMG!! What a STARBOY!!
Love how everyone tries to compare saka to rashford rashford is 5 or 6 years older then saka, people act like they are both promising youngsters.  Rashford should be where is he now it’s not that impressive saka is playing well above and beyond what a 21 year old should be doing.
Saka SUPERSTAR already what a player he is
Long 1-2 for the first goal
Looking at the newspaper headlines I had thought saka had dribbled past  10 players and then dinked it past the goalie 😂
Why Maguire still playing for England
If Saka was Australian he would be a Sakaroo
THATS MY STARBOY COYG
At least now everyone can see why we have high praises for Saka at arsenal, its not based on delusional love
Awww we all feel sorry for ukraine aint we supposed to keep them happy ?
Part from the goals that was one of the most boring games I've witnessed. Seemed like they wasnt trying. I know it might of been a easy game but atleast make it entertaining instead of just a game of let's see how many times we can pass the ball round the back 😂 edit: brilliant goal from Saka though
Best right winger currently in Europe/world??
Ukraine won the match on sympathy votes!
Long drag of a game, subs should of came much earlier, no disrespect to Ukraine but we was comfortable all second half... 3pts was the main thing
Why wasn’t Maddison picked to go to World Cup another cock up by Southgate he was best player in t Prem before World Cup n he d rather play Phillips more who s only half fit
Англия понадусе! Украйняку на гиляку!😂
Saka is a good player but the amount of English people hyping him up like he's the next Ronaldo is hilarious
Well done England Slava Ukraini !! 🇬🇧🦖🇺🇦✊
Let the boy enjoy his football typical British commentating take them up to the moon prematurely then drop them without a parachute
I feel so proud Saka is a gooner, he keeps getting better & better, producing week in & week out.. if that’s not world class then I don’t know what is!
Imagine if saka keeps up this form with Arsenal in the champions league he could win Ballon d'Or in the next couple of years incredible talent.
But.. But... Ukraine most important thing ever... Must let win...
England are the Tottenham of International football never win anything.
Have I missed something? Why are these highlights on Channel 4?
Saka and Bellingham were both excellent, Kane even when not scoring is essential for his link up play. Maddison played well at times but I wasn't a fan of him constantly whinging at either the ref or his own team mates. I get he is eager to show what he can do but a bit more maturity was needed.
Respect for Ukraine. For them lads to play? Brilliant.❤
Saka always using Rashfords celebrations
What a rich vein of form Saka is in! Confidence and style!
I still remember your response when he missed a penalty
How long must it take for Maguire to get a header on target!?😂
Saka 🐐
HE’S ONE OF OUR OWN!!! HE’S ONE OF OUR OWN!!! BUKAYO SAKA HE’S ONE OF OUR OWN!!!
As a Nigerian I wish Saka played for us instead but England, take care of this guy because he has a bright future ahead of him with you guys.
It's about time he played Maddison.
If Saka keeps playing this good he’s gonna end up getting benched for Mount
As a utd fan,Saka is top top quality
outstanding thunderbolt strike🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪👏👏👏😁😁😁!! Winning 2 matches is great but the next step is playing like THIS at The euro's/world cup then actually win the whole Thing instead of going it’s Coming Home then it all goes backwards!! I won’t be singing it’s coming Home until I see the men reaching a FINAL and winning it like the lionesses European summer doing the men's job for them😎!  keep it up playing good focused Football then it will be worth watching! + Congratulations Captain Kane😃👏👏👏keep it up!
Saka is the best player on the planet without doubt
Saka Kane Rashford would cook
Shouldn't England stand aside and let Ukraine have the 3 points, so they can qualify? That's what they said to Scotland and Wales last year.
saka and kane great pair
Sakaaaaass
How have u managed to find 8 mins of footage in this game.
Kane will score about 80+ goals by the end of his career. One of the best strikers in history not to win any trophy. How sad
Looks like Rashford is a big hit with the under 15s on here.
Saka is insane and still so humble, unlike a certain young baguette eater
It wasn't a screamer, as in very hard shot. It was well placed curler
Saka had an absolute blinder of a game. Real 11/10
Pointless game! Everyone knows England n Italy gonna qualify soon as group came out! England cud show real class by letting Ukraine win 2nd game for their people at War, and still England wud qualify top of group!😂
Balogun getting no love or support from his teammates. His positioning was good when he came on. Should have been picked out so as to have an opportunity to shoot at least. And Maguire's free header? Jesus. Negative stuff out of the way - great win!
Great team England rubbish channel 4 who hates democracy
Saka is a world class player England don't have many but he's one of them
That was for Eurovision
*6:39* poor decision making and pass by Gallagher in my view there. Tony was in a better position. But if you're going to give it Grealish there that pass has to be much better.
Southgate critics must be so disappointed by another win.
Good time to be an England fan, great team atm.
saka=magic. kane=lazy tap in merchant
Light work
Does Ukrainian Team exists
Kane plays everywhere that was fantastic goal 👍
Am I missing something  A second rated team beats a third rated team 2-0 After a poor World Cup and poor opening European and being substituted he is now a wonder kid for scoring a goal Come on keep some perspective
Saka just gets better every time I see him play
Saka top man again.. one thing that always annoys me are defenders who stop, hold their arm up claiming off side before a decision is made! Ukraine could have equalised.. I know he missed and eventually linesman put his flag up but ffs.. just play to the whistle..it will cost us one day….
I don’t think I remember a player more loved by majority of fans than saka and tbf rightly so!
We'll send them weapons, but we won't let them beat us at football? Come now...
Standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine will go down in history in the same way as doing the nazi salute in the 1930s did when the truth about that vile country comes out. Absolute disgrace.
England needs a new manager.  Southgate is the wrong guy for the job. England has so many world-class players and he didn't make subs until the end of the match. We have no reason to let Kane play more the 60 minutes
Someone needs to tell Gallagher he’s allowed to look right …
Rashford Kane Saka there’s your Euro title
Ch.4's footy coverage has been very good and having a YouTube thingamajig, Jules Breach showing she an excellent presenter. As I rely solely on terrestrial tv for footy/sport I've really enjoyed not having Lineker+ his chuckling sidekicks on screen, thank you Ch.4
Saka really changed my opinion he’s one of the best in the world right now
What a goal for Saka!! Come on England! Onto the next🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
England still won't win fk all 😅
Saka will win the Ballon d'Or in two years
Was at the game, Saka was unbelievable 😍 sat right next to the pitch as well
even this game makes a cricket match look fun
Shame on England. Beating Ukraine in a situation like this??? They are nothing better than Russia... To show support they should have lost today, that would be the PC thing to do!
0:57 note how Maguire doesn't bother running because he knows Ukraine are offside.
Thought they were having a war? Bread and circuses! Jesus
Saka is the ultimate role model for a young footballer.  Amazing talent, humble character and hungry to prove himself.  Been brought up well and is surrounded by good coaches.  As a Gooner, makes me so proud that he is our home grown player🥰
Bro it still boggles my mind, how fast England fans have switched up on Saka like god damn
The lads have played so well the last two games.  They can be proud of themselves I feel.
Have I gone deaf or there is no sound in this clip?
Saka has a chance.
what a woke show.....
Saka becoming the player he is now after that penalty miss in the Euros final is truly amazing. Most other players would let it prevent them reaching their full potential.
We must protect this real gem at all cost ❤
I was there what a game it was the atmosphere was alright what a goal by Saka 😊🎉
🌶️
Saka started poorly but then got the win with a beautiful assist and rocket of a goal.
Harry Kane a the record breaker he can’t stop scoring he a hurrikane
Haaland is English, he should be playing for England. He would stand a much better chance of winning a world cup or euro if he swapped to his birth place.
Second half was so sit back England ,let’s not give them a thrashing because of the war morale thing in Russia.
I was at the game soooo good
Well-done to the Ukraine team for their participation irrespective of the War.
What I've noticed is England Win=hate England lost=Hate just stfu 🙄
Yeah obviously
Saka we will never forget that Pen.
Well Done England! Hope You Win the Euro 2024! Best Wishes From Bosnia 🇧🇦👏
Imagine Saka and Kane in the same Arsenal team, hey Spurs fans. 😄
Garath "no plan b" Southgate
Saka was dropped and pulled off when he was Englands best player at the world cup. Now he needs a rest and has started almost every game in every cup for Arsenal Southgate leave him on. Saka is one of the most used  players in the league this season but was the only atarting attacker to finish the game. Southgate is a prick.
Congratulations from Polish football fan.p.s.you got couch and team to get it in Germany.
Why aren't these Ukrainian men fighting in their war? Cowards
I know everyone is say they played so well , however, they have no Chance against the big boys if they played backwards the way they did in the second half . So I hope they get it together and attack without complacency and remember ,no sympathy. Attack attack attack.  .
Drop kane. Rashford striker, foden and saka wings.
Can't really fault any player tonight which is unusual seeing as I always worry about our defense more than anything and lack of pace sometimes. Yes , a great goal from Saka and the stand out player of this game. Great to see Maddison get on and show his worth , a better proposition than Grealish in my book , more versatile in general play. It's a pity Toney didn't get on earlier but I hope he gets more time in the next two games to settle in with the squad properly in case Kane gets an injury , Toney is the most likely understudy for Kane. We seem to have a very strong squad and with a little more attack minded pace injected instead of the dawdling at the back so much things could get even better. Well done lads.
So, how much of this match was playing into the Ukrainian War Narrative?  The one with no footage of any actual fighting?
I was there
Is there an argument about Saka being the best right winger in the world given mo salah's form? Mahrez and Di maria aren't in great form either I think if saka takes England all the way in euros we can conclude this.
Still a apple
Oi as a city fan hats off to saka he’s fucking world class
I’m sick of people goin on about Ukraine who cares!!!  it’s a football match I’m not interested In anything else
Southgate is seriously ruining our best group of players for years
What the f happened to Sterling?
Saka! DEFIANCE! STILL STANDING 🤛🤜
Var is so inconsistent - that challenge on kane was a pen. I know it doesn’t matter but when something happens early in the game var let’s it go
Kane master of only tap ins and penalties.. A total waste of space
2-0 England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 v Ukrain is bad we should’ve beat them 4-0 like last time😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🔝
Saka is Europe's vinicius jr
The propaganda for that “war” is ridiculous…in fact most are getting sick too death of it
Nationwide, get rid of the logo. Spoils the view.
It’s coming home come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 ⚪️🔴
World class is Starboy.
England's all time most prolific penalty taker (Kane) is clearly in top form: flinging himself to the floor inside the penalty box within 8 minutes.  Shows the hours put in, nose down on the training pitch. However, Southgate won't be pleased with that first goal.  I'm sure Southgate would insist that Kane shouldn't have stuck his foot out like that, but instead, have put all his energy into a convincing swan dive to gain the penalty.
I thought Maddison was pretty good with spin and turn and had many opportunities to score. Good decent debut. Saka, Bellingham, Kane all great!
When your a war torn country..yet you find it more important.  How you compete in a game of football..😂😂
So Ukraine are at war with Russia and receiving billions in aid from manty countries yet they can still put a football team together. Something not right here. Apart from the result. Well played England.
Saka is a good  young African footballer
Saka is the man of the match
Shouldn’t Ukraine be focusing on other things like you know ….fighting a war ?
What’s happened to BT sport sky sport
Boy Ukraine are a poor team these days
The day we have rice Bellingham and foden rashford saka and Kane willl be a good day 😅
2nd half Danny Dyer ..
Rubbish Highlights.. Show The Subs.. A Player Made His Debut 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nationwide can get tf out the doing my nut in 😤
People still watch england games with southgate as manager?
The opening highlight is a penalty all day long.
Why isn't rashford in the starting line up
That's my boy
English media again all over saka he give the ball away numerous times yeah he scored and assisted but other than that he was useless
Saka is England. Saka is Arsenal. At 21… what a player
Gallagher was pulling some MJ moves with the ball, saucy 💯
Love that when Gallagher misses his shot you see him say “how the f did I miss that “ 😂
AWFUL ENGLAND MANAGER, DRAB PLAYERS, rather watch paint dry than England try and play football.
Saka the man.
That was nice 🔥🔥🔥
Sakaaaaaaaa ❤
Kane again looking for a penalty what a surprise.embarrassing.
3:14 what you came for
Take a Bow Saka amazing performance I'm a Proud Arsenal fan
Been to work all day looking forward to watching the game tonight. I've avoided the score all day only to find that shit ch4 haven't put it on the app. Fucking woke bastards.
Southgate is class, I don’t get the hate against him
Best England XI                                      Kane  Rashford                                       Saka                               Foden               Bellingham        Rice  Shaw/chillwelll     Stones.       Maguire.  Walker                                Pickford
Starboy shines 😅
So not only do nationwide have the most annoying and cringe inducing adverts on TV, they also have to plaster their logo over football highlights...
Get in
So why didn’t England pull a diplomatic blinder and let Ukraine win?😂
Saka is better than Mount
It’s just a shame this England side has such a poorus manager in charge
Saka is THAT guy right now
2030 England win WC saka captain
Saka’s still learning how to play football no disrespect just a compliment…What a player🐐☝🏽☝🏽💯
I remember when white people were racist to Saka
I love this guy. He’s unreal for club and country. 21 years old and already has 8 goals and I don’t know how many assists.
That was a strong win for England. Southgate is a good manager. Maddison had a good game for England. Maddison had a loan spell at Aberdeen FC, in Scotland earlier in his career.
England football is a joke, one of the biggest premier ship in the world and won the world cup once. Last two mach know proper left link. This game only have one attack from the left for the entire 95 mins. Up to now none of these talented player reach Sterling level and the stat show it. Where is all the English ex footballer  crictic that even cannot be a proper manager saying anything about it.why are they fighting Sterling so much and he's the best left winger they still have?
Saka is the undisputed GOAT now.
The double drop of the shoulder on that Saka goal just as good as the strike
How boring are we to watch,we must be the world champs at passing the ball backwards and sideways.
Why did Saka have to play full 90 minute’s when England was comfortably leading 2-0? Kane should have played full 90 minutes now that spurs have nothing to play for.
I fell asleep in this game
I went to this game today and we all got our flash lights out, it was so cool shame they didn’t show it
Arteta has made this guy into a world beater, saka honestly has 0 weaknesses🌟
Why can't they play the top teams then we will see if they're good
Ukraine should be banned from playing football too tbh they’re constantly asking for money to wage a war
Saka looked hot against Italy , that's a banging strike that is .
Saka has to be player of year surely
Saka is the man my guy 👊🏽 #arsenalstarman #englandstarman
This is why Southgate needs sacking 2-0 against Ukraine and we thing we can challenge for tournaments, I hope we don't qualify if Southgate remains in charge saves the embarrassment, too defensive and too much backwards passing.
Sakas Growing With Confidence, One Watch
Hope the racist in this country don’t ruin him he’s is safe in London don’t trust them white folks up north
I have a funny feeling we win a major trophy soon.
Original Starboy
Hooray! At last! Kane is stood were he's meant to be and ready for a brilliant cross from Saka. Now keep doing that!
Assist and a goal COYG 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Didn't watch the game but why didn't Southgate take off saka and made him play the whole game as he's the main man at arsenal and arsenal need him for the league, but takes off kane and maddison
Can we all appreciate how good the Ukrainian goalkeeper was? 💙💛
Great result and amazing performance from saka, but you just feel that with Southgate managing a team of such talented individuals the euros will slip from England again.
We cut through the defence like a Russian Tank through the Crimea 😂
Kudos to Harry and Saka, both are legendary in their own field of play. Cheers
Ukraine you are best frendly
Look at the mentality difference between Saka and Sancho, one was being an overweight bum whilst the other is on his way to winning the title with Arsenal and being one of the most influential players in this England team
Without Saka England would struggle
Starboy 💫
Need some of them for arsenal!! Yes saka!!?
The English beat Ukraine and they think they have won the tournament.
ref didjnt give the pen at the start bc of the war 🤣🤣
Hes the Starboy🤩
And the racism seems to go quiet when the starboy does the business 👂🏾
Saka *will* be one of the best in the world in a few years time!
Saka's been watching Kane replays😂
Give the star boy a break we need him to win the pl!!
Thanks for putting me to sleep the second half.
All of those ukrainian players and fans should be fighting the russians........Football is very inappropriate for them during a war........Absolute madness.
Looks like the ref received a transaction before the game or it’s just out of ‘solidarity’ Ukraine. At least be fair in games.
Maguire & stones cant play out from the back Boring, Stones is a bottlerthey need to get married
8 minutes? Get it down to 2 please.
How is that a screamer? Just a basic outside the box goal, wasnt even that far out. Just sucking him off at this point.
Why are the Ukrainian players not fighting with their countrymen and the Ukrainian fans look old enough to protect their country 😡
over to the expert Rob .. ouch
connor gallagher at 5:43, "how tf have i missed that" 🤣
Wow saka what a player😂
👑👏👏STAR BOY SAKA‼️
Saka and Kane link up😢 buy him arteta
Hope Mudryk got a great view of Sakas goal... Here's what you could have won 😂
What a goal from Saka...
We will win the Euros...
Saka is a real Gem🎉
People give Southgate shit but he was the one that gave Saka his international debut and stuck with him
Saka.  Wow! .. and to think he was nearly destroyed a year ago...bigotry really is a cancer
Great goal by Saka. An absolutely brilliant talent. But let’s not pretend he’s the best young player we’ve ever seen. Before 21 Dele Ali over 40 goals. That tally was more than Cristiano Ronaldo had managed at the same age, and the same as Beckham, Gerrard and Lampard combined.
Saka is world class, arguably one of the best wingers in world football at the moment. My Star boy ❤
If Englands eurovision 2022 was sung by a black man... I wonder whether Ukraine would've won that by default? Must be so hard for the elite when they have to prioritise one of their narratives to make a mockery of another
Smashed em better than putin as
Brilliant from England was never in doubt but the way the presenters were at half time towards a Ukrainian legend was poor and embarrassing! He looked uncomfortable and that’s not on. No wonder most of the world don’t like the English when you pull shit like that !!!
Sake get's an assist and scores against a poor Ukranian side who got spanked by Wales and he's now world class??? Welcome to the internet.... (Thankfully the game was just a Euro qualifier and not a Euro final penalty shootout)
Really dislike Arsenal but Saka is something else
saka is deffo a nail on in england no doubts
KINDA FEEL GUILTY BEATING UKRAINE, THEYRE SUCH A GREAT COUNTRY, AND SO BRAVE, HOPE WE CAN HELP THEM ALL WE CAN.
saka my idol
Star boy saka ⚽ 🔥
We have some very talented players but Southgates defensive first tactics are so boring. Take Walker for example - in club football he always bombs forward and stretches defences. Under Southgate he rarely crosses the halfway line. We'll never win anything under this idiot so no reason to get excited.
He's a special kid.
This might be the year for kanes first trophy and England's first ever coming home after 1966 inshallah
Great goal by saka
Can't tell if England are good or Ukraine were poor... should've been 7-0. Granted these are only highlights on a British channel
Even as a Utd fan, I can't help but heap praise on Saka. What a player.
Loved seeing Saka up against Mudryk. Saka showed him how its actually done
As an Arsenal fan I genuinely cannot believe he is ours
England 2-0 Russia
Celebrate the goal stop drinking water, you twatgate
Even viagra couldn't get me up for England game
if it a real war with russia why are they not back home fighting
no need for these highlights to be this long lol
🇬🇧🇺🇦
Apparently harry kane found Saka not the other way round. Stupid commentators
Yh. This "lack of depth" is saving Southgate's job.
Saka needs to move to a better club
Saka is a freak!
*KING SAKA!* 👑⚽
Harry Kane tapped the ball in, and all the commentators do is praise Kane, barely mentions Saka, racist much
Kane’s too good
Sad(England now top 5 teams in the world.Good luck in future games
Hopefully Saka has a long and healthy career
Saka is the goat youngster
Kane > Saka > Kane > Goal I mean do we really need 11 players?
Best player ITW
Saka and Kane on fire, whole team looked great, maybe now
Starboy!!
It’s coming home
Whooppiii.  Kicked a ball in net.
All for nothing. No cups ever
I still think it was a own goal.  (Kane)
Great start to the campaign,  but I always feel we should be doing more with the quality we have up front. (playing & on the bench)
Truly, no keeper in the world saves that Saka goal. 3 keepers probably don't manage it
Saka for Arsenal is magic saka for England is special what a talented player looking forward to this Euro 2024 💪
He's English before the RASCISTS Cripps out. BUKAYO SAKA(NIGERIAN Star Boy)
Gallagher should have kept going
Saka is England bests player by a million miles !!!!!!!!! Dynamite!!!!!!
Where's the blue in the flag of England?
Southgate you're the one
Kane to Arsenal
Saka is the future of English Football
Top draw goal from saka, love that an arsenal player is scoring for England
You can clearly tell Saka came back stronger after euro 2020
straight outta Hale End.
I wish they didn't put the winner in the title.
But y didn't he give Saka a rest 😕
If anything were to happen to Kane... Oh wait never mind, we have a backup who is match-proven with a whole nine minutes of experience! WTF Gareth?
The team that NEVER WON NAWT SINCE 66 OH BUT GREAT GOAL   KANE TOP SCORER BIG DEAL  ALL MILKING THE 3 MILLION QUID A YEAR COW
saka is such a baller, bros been on a redemption arc ever since the euros 💪
people mention rashford and saka in the same breath, needs to stop.
*Arsenal Starboy. Arsenal fans have known for a while that Saka is World Class* 🌟
Good defender that Mudryk 😂
Don’t ever compare saka to these bummy youngsters again!!! 😮‍💨😮‍💨
fantastic performance...way to go England!
Saka scoring worldies in his endz. What a time to be alive!
Bravo!
Good fuck Ukraine
Brexit is turning Pengland to Sinkland! 👎
Saka and Bellingham are the future for England. Their quality on the ball and intelligence of the game is so mature and amazing and only being youngsters... the only way is up for these two.  A very steady game for us today, we had control from start to finish. Just wish we subbed early so that Toney and Gallagher had more time out on the pitch.  Can't wait to see Rashford back with the team. Kane, Saka and Rashford are going to make England shine if we can sort out our shaky defence and bring in some new talent
See them goals scored ever other week in the prem hahaha where is the hype around Sakas goal from?😂
Interesting that a certain youngster is performing but others ain’t… yeah keep comparing nonces
Beaut of a goal from Saka! Full confidence that the boys will be bringing it home for 2024 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Ukraine at a disadvantage as they had to endure a tiring long journey
Saka is so good❤
A real peach from the arsenal youngster what a gem
And now they gonna beat by russia and then hopefully my electric wont be so expensive
Deport Ukrainians now lol
Boring play
Said it years ago and people laughed at me.........best England team in my lifetime even with Slabhead on the pitch. In Southgate we trust.
Saka is our future 🔥
Ukraine refugees at wembley instead of fighting on front line
21 years old he’s special!
Also gotta love Kane starting and finishing his goal. The cross field pass to Saka 👌
Madders with a W debut, unfortunate not to get on the score/assist sheet though.
Was it really this one sided? Not a single Ukrainian highlight. 😲
Maguire the donkey.
Special goal
Saka. That’s all that needs to be said
The pass from kane to saka was sensational
What a goal by Saka
if it wasn't for a Saka worldie we're looking at a 1-0 performance against a team that couldn't even register a shot against us (on or off target) really pathetic. not winning any trophies with performances like that today.
why arn't these guys on the front line fighting for NATO?
How boring is it watching England nowadays'.. Backwards pass after backwards pass. Switched over after 6 or 7 minutes. I think the lack of fans in the stadium just about sums peooles thoughts up about our national side, only getting behind them in the latter stages of the World Cup. Same players and tactics that were applied at a failed World Cup campaign so what will change for the Euros... Absolutley nothing = another failed tournament  🥱🥱🥱
Saka is the man with the plan 😏
If Kane was at Chelsea, Man City, Man United or a host of big name clubs abroad he'd have won so many trophies by now. This year he needs to move.
Ukraine supporters turned the channel to the war as Englands football was too boring.
the logo.
Ukraine apparently getting invaded and their refugees are at Wembley enjoying the game
Don’t see anyone raving for Gareth when England win but the moaners come out of hibernation soon as there is a draw or loss. Definitely a weird fan base.
Saka being overrated by english again😅😅😅
How is he 21! England have a very strong future
Saka, Rashford and Bellingham
England haters gone quiet rn
Keep going Ukraine
Light work
Ha! The Ukrainian offence is almost as bad as [REDACTED]
The best player in England at the moment
You're right. England rarely play well, entertain the crowd for about three mins of each ninety, and the games are mind numbing to watch. They never build up a head of steam, and their success comes about because the majority of international teams are mid table championship quality at best. I'm sure that Pickford has more outfield touches than any other player. I should have stuck with the golf !
Saka shot a bomb against Ukraine, giving them flash backs
Lets see what England do when we play a top side!
This team is on the pathway to win Euro 2024.
Saka is absolutely brilliant well done young man
The Kane hate on the other game comments and Saka love really tells a lot. Can’t arsenal fans put rivalries aside and appreciate a good player. I’m spurs and can appreciate what a talent saka is. But saka assist this , saka assist that… Kane made that goal with that pass. People saying kane does nothing from open play are deluded and only scores pens. Ridiculous. Best player in the time by a country mile formulated with logic rather than emotion.
Omg saka was even told to do summing else but he knew what a prodigy
SHOULD HAVE LEFT UKRAINE WIN THEY NEED IT FOR CONSOLATION
Was that long ago Ukrainian fans would be doing monkey chants.
If Saka is this good NOW , what's he going to be like in 4 or 5 years time ?
They really compared Saka to every youngster but he’s surpassed them. I don’t think there’s been a better youngster for England since Rooney was coming up. 21 and doing this is crazy if he wins the league this is best individual season in a long time ❤️🙏
2 goals, 8 minutes worth of footage.  Was a lacklustre game.
Saka is a great player a professional performance not their best.
Tap pin merchant England kane
He's called starboy for a reason 🌟
Saka is the best Winger in the world right now! No ones better! World class!
BS7🔴⚪️ StarBoy 🌟  Gods Child😇 Bukayo Saka♥️
I’m only here coz of SAKA ❤
Saka will go down as the greatest footballer to ever live.
Kane and his kneeling muppets at it again after all the UK is a racist society declares BLM!!
honestly England needs to find a new manager, he is the one that hold this country back. leading 2-0 and didn't make any changes until 80mins. Each individuals played very well but It’s damn boring.
Palestinian flags! oppression of Muslims in China! and its keep religion and politics out of football........Ukraine proxy bs and its spoon fed down peoples throats. The hypocrisy of this country is absolutely vile. We all know why its like this though don't we..
North london link up
For the euro 2024 we hav to have Rashford Lw, Saka RW, Kane ST and Foden CAM and that will be  best attack itw!!
Good job englund
England will soon have a forward line of:  Reiss Nelson        Nketiah           Saka                                 Esr  The people who racially abused Saka after the pen miss should be ashamed.
This is a good result. Another 3 points for the group and it would've felt very wrong to smash Ukraine by 4+
Love it that when Kane scores a goal it's because of his talent and skill, when Saka scores a worldie, it's because he's practised it "1000 times"
Now Banchester Utd fans, just admit Saka is MUCH better than Rashford lol you won't cos you're deluded! BANCHESTER UTD
Saka is the man. England's best player.
1 assist,1 goal,well done starboy
From Russia with love
You just don't give HARRY CLAIM that sort of space because he'll have you on toast.And I'm sure the UKRAINIAN MANAGER  said the exact same warning as me..
Genuine question. How do we play them away?
A front 3 of Kane, Saka and Rashford would be as good as anything in world football
Hhhhhh Ukrainezelensly 00
This was the guy England fans racially abused for missing a penalty in the world cup 🤡
Can we stop pretending Maddison should be in the team now, absolute shite all game.
ENGLAND
Saka is clear
Cracking goal saka, amazing player and skill

To be fair England are pretty much euro /world champs at the moment. I'm loving it last few yrs .. streets ahead of anybody
