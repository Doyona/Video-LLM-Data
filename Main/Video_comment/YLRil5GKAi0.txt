ℳ𝒶𝒹𝒶𝓇𝒸𝒽ℴ𝒹 𝓋𝒾𝒹ℯℴ.
Christmas!
YES CHRISTMASS PLEASEEEE
It’s not even december
Yess christmas or nye
Niki.. at the show you had WITH GABI your friends stayed the whole time so if that shows you anything it should be that they’re fake.
Why does Gabi have Herbalife at her house???? She literally has so much
Your maturity as sisters I AM HERE FOR IT! I love that you guys are closer and better then ever❤️
aww I literally got a little emotional watching niki up on that stage, she deserves to be up there! ❤️‍🔥☝🏻
The way Gabi literally said “TELL HER TO LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!” Like bro, that’s your sister why are you using an assistant for that??? Hey your phone and tell her straight up “LEAVE ME ALONE WHILE I FIGURE OUT MY PROBLEM..” simple
I need a Christmas in New York or Christmas getaway!! With secret Santa and stuff like that!
You guys doing the dance to Judas i know lady Gaga moves when i see them yesss
https://youtu.be/vs2FqxNRiqk

Hi 😍🥰🥰😘😘💋💋♥️❤️🦋♥️♥️💝✨😚😉💝Hee Hee Aw bill Jan say hi
Lol The fact that that wasn't the first time Gabi had farted in a serious situation to ease the tension. (The first was in Niki and Gabi take Miami)
I like niki 🥺❤️

Not colon being barnacle boy
CHRISTMAS IN NYC!!! gosh that would be so beautiful 😍
When gabi farts LMFAO
A Christmas series pppplllleeeeaaaasssseeee
I love how Collin is honest with Gabi during s conversation and they take it so maturely
Everytime Niki cries I cry 😢 dammit
6:30 - I love how Colin is unbiased and tells Gabi like it is. Love that he isn’t a Yes man, has her back, and doesn’t sugar coat situations. Truly a quality person everyone needs in their lifetime
Ok mike! I loved his costume ! Lol
christmas in new york!
your assistants deserve a raise lmfaoo
Finally
Love ya! ❤️
I love gabis scarf omg

Christmas is NYC!!!!!!!!
its not a niki and gabi show without drama
I almost cried when gabi thanked niki for pushing her to throw the party and not let her sadness win, lily was partying in spirit also bear is adorable and I’m hoping will be in more videos soon
Gabi clearly didnt want to have the party but Niki kept pressuring her one way or another. Its always Niki not listening to others 😅
اتاري مو بس العرب بيعملو مناظر وتمثيليات بين بعضهم منشان يجيبو مشهدات لايكات وتعليقات طلعو الاجاني كمان 😤😤😤😤😤😤الله لا يشبعكن مشاهدات وتعليقات تفو

I love niki’s hair
Something was up with the mic during the interview things, it just sounded muffled. But the party looked like fun and I'm SO HAPPY that everyone showed up for Niki at her 1st show! She killed it and Niki you deserve all the recognition because you are an amazing singer, songwriter and performer!

Yesssssssssssssssssss a Christmas one would be amazing!!!
CHRISTMAS ONE PLEASEREEEEEEEE.
Nicki's friends gotta go they aren't contributing anything to their relationship with her
Christmas one would definitely be interesting
The fact that Gabi farts and then proceeds to get up and walk away. 💀 ♥️ lmfao  She makes me laugh. 😂
I love them so much
💗
everyone say thank you teammm..!!
путин издевается надо мной с помощью многочисленных баб в ютюб
2 episodes only???
Christmas in New York!
I would love to see a Christmas version!!!!
What happened to Rachel? She hasn’t been around in forever
niki your hair looks INCREDIBLE darker i’m actually obsessed. y’all look so good
The miscommunication thing stressed me out. I get wanting to vent to people but you gotta put people in boxes sometimes. Like this person is safe to talk about this, this person can hear about this, this person won’t tell anyone this, so on and so forth. And if ever you have an issue with a specific person, take it up with them to avoid confusion. This is just advice to everyone in general lol.
Chrismas
She looks like kim k
Christmas 🎄 in NY Yessss queennsss plssss ✨✨✨✨
Christmas!
Yall is Gabi pregnant??😻😻😻
CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK😍 you two are the best x
A Christmas series would be so good but I love this.
Shout out to Nate fr, videography was amazing
You both should come out with Niki & Gabi Merch!💖
Love the drama 🥰😂
Niki with her pride flag at her show is everything 🌈🏳️‍🌈❤
Christmas series!!!!!!!!!
We need  Christmas one!!! Love the reality series you guys do!
Christmas series plssssssssss
christmas in new york!
Go to VEGAS
Gabi here!! Just wanted to clarify that I did send niki a text explaining the issue but due to all those groupchats going off and assistant miscommunication she missed it! Glad you’re enjoying the show 🤍
Not Gabi complaining about not having an assistant, sis. Just hire one.
I've been waiting forever for this
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
I admire Niki and Gabi for handling the situation, and you can really tell how much their relationship has improved. I love how much fun everyone had and everybody looks incredible in their costumes!!!❤️❤️😊
Season finale? There was only 2 15 minute episodes 😩
Christmas in New York would be an awesome reality show! Zx
CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS PLEASE
We need a thanksgiving series and then a Christmas in New York series next!!
Christmas one!!!
I do miss the series being longer though, this one seemed soooooooo short 🥺
We need one in D.C. 😍
We need more series like these!
PLEASE DO CHRISTMAS OMG
i love how collin keeps it real with gabi though i love him for her
Please christmas in New york

Collin is a great boyfriend telling you the truth, but saying it kindly. He did not hold back and I love that for him
Where is Allie?
CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK!!
WE WANT MOREEEE
Christmas in New York?!? Yes please!!!
💜
FINALLY LMAO
I am so lok-key sad that there were only 2 eps :(
Loved the twinowiene, but lets be honest this is not a series... 2 caps does not make a series.
CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK LET'S GOOOOOOOO 🌲🎊🪄🎀
Thanks giving haul
Why the party had to be at Gabi’s? Nikki should have been understood the situation and organize it at her home
Omg i love this Series 💙🖤💙🖤💙🖤
Loved both costumes, gabi's was my favourite from the party
Does anyone realize how staged and produced this is
in this video Niki was such a brat, if a house might go on a fire this party does not matter period. safety first
this is proof that rachel not being there results in less drama
Your friends might not be there for you because everything is always about you I wonder if you show up to things that are important to them or you're too busy with your own life to?
So what's the title about? Your assistant was sick...now you're saying you shouldn't hire your friends?
I wanna see a christmas series
I would love to see a winter vacation with skiing ice skating in a cabin in the woods ☃️❄️🏔️
i love how she always plugs in her pumpkin spice face cream xD
So why did Gabi kick Niki's ass while she was having a moment on the dance floor?
christmas videos
CHRISTMAS!!!!!
Please do a Friendsgiving series
We NEED a Christmas series please 😭😭😭
So happy for you and your first show Niki!

New Year Reality Show
PLEASE do Christmas in New York🏙🎄♥️
Awh, my boyfriends an electrician…he woulda did it at 2 am. He just replaced a panel yesterday for someone. On the bright side, your house most likely wouldn’t have caught fire from it not being updated, but the breakers would have probably constantly tripped making your party super stressful. I’m glad y’all worked it out like adults. So much growth 🖤
CHRISTMAS VACTION HOUSE IN THE MONTAIND OR IN NYC
