can someone explain the sword bearer.  looks like u get only 3 strike then the sword disappear.   so heavy, heavy, and heavy sword strike.  then sword disappear.  Does this mean all 3 strike has to connect?
Is there not any guides for this solo? I can’t find one.
Got to love how long winded this guy is like shit I just need to know the basics not
So it does no good if the enlightener isn't waiting for everyone
As a new Destiny 2 player, this sounds ridicoulously complicated. Think ill stay away from this dungeon until i reach 1000 hours 😂
Why does it have to be soo complicated 😢 its back and forth with different alternating tasks. Cant there be a simple raid where boss just has a bigger health pool and take longer to kill? OR At the very least, can bungie Introduce different Raid "Raid Elements" into Vanguard Strikes so as to make players more familiar with Procedures to follow 🤔. EX. ( A strike mission where Darkness fills and need to pass the chalice back & forth to prevent getting weighted down, and no negative effects for holding the light too long) this would allow players to familiarize themselves with this step and do the same with other steps of other raids. ITS LIKE THIS, WOULD YOU TEACH A KID TO DRIVE PLAYING "NEED FOR SPEED" MOBILE GAME THEN HAND HIM THE KEYS TO DRIVE YOUR CAR AND SAY HE'S ALL GOOD, HE CAN DO IT? Introducing elements of raids throughout the strikes would help drastically and include more gamers to play.
Clearly they didn't run the lord of wolves back then
Question. Does the longer you hang around the lantern the more the weight reduces?
They changed the mechanics from d1, they didn't have the chalice of lights back then
Man I miss the good ol warlock days when revives were an option as we would just have the squad wipe and then revive as a way to get rid of all ads and then take the sword from sword bearer and use it to jump off totems and fly in a safe route across without even needing the bridge... Lol..  This was so much fun.. Ran this raid solo once 😊
I remember playing this raid without all these perks and swords you have . It was a lot of grinding and fun
Thank you sir
Takéto videa sú viac menej na dve veci... :D Čo z toho keď 95% hráčov hrá s náhodnými hráčmi (ja tiež). A tí napr. v Cora´s End sú ešte viac stratený než ja. Keď to nejde na prvý pokus tak sa zakrátko rozutekajú napr. na začiatku v tej tme. A keď už sa začne umierať na nespoluprácu tak už rovno odchádzajú z raidu. Tento návod je super pokiaľ ide všetko ako z učebnice. Tieto aktivity mali byť aj v sólo režime ako to bolo v Destiny 1. Inak je to nehrateľné. A potom na to doplácajú aj taký čo majú záujem o Destiny a učiť sa...
This raid rework is trash dude. Shit is absurdly difficult for no reason. I could see it being reasonable if pinnacles dropped at every chest like it did in D1 but not even challenge mode in D1 was this hard.
Man I was trying to do this solo I must stupid or something
how do you stop the countdown in the first encounter? the bridge is not building up
Who else thinks these mechanics ruin raids
Raids actually make me hate this game. This is too much, and I don't use mic for some randos.
you made this more confusing then it had to be
THey should have left it alone. Stop reprising the old stuff. maybe make the enemies stringer but leave it alone. I have no interest in juggling stupid crap throughout these encounters.
In the abyss you don’t have to enlighten every lantern do you?
Bruh so... wtf am I missing when I go to look, and Destiny 1 content is... not here? What I mean is I go into the map, and Crotas End isn't even shown on the moon, nor is Venus for vault of glass, or even... again quite literally: Any piece of D1 content in D2, except so far for Cosmodrome...  Am I missing a DLC or somethin?
big daddy crota is wild💀💀
i love you
Thank you!  This is exactly the kind of in-depth guide that I needed to understand this raid.
Instructions unclear crossed bridge with chalice, wasn’t able to place well, only tether
What gun he running?
ChatGPT Refered me to this video 😭
I just did this raid with the fireteam finder and we did the whole raid and it was so awesome i got the abyss defiant and two pieces of armor and two more weapons and i am trying to get necrohasm
Man i def want farm thise deathsinger's mantle look nice on strand armor glowing green parts......too bad i m deaf myself dont think such good idea to run raid without cooperating thur mics cause mic is useless for me😔
they should’ve kept the raid the same with minor changes because this is too much work for what the raid was in the first game
Honestly, for me the worst part of destiny is having to rely on clan as some are not interested in the raids and or dungeons. Its been a frustrating and then people quitting. When they do attempt others act like complete morons and kick then instead of guiding them SUCKS. Bungie needs to come up for a work around for those who are NOT interested in raids nor dungeons and still acquire good drops.
They had no need to add this new mechanic that wasn’t there in the original. They reprised Atheon perfectly, why they didn’t do the same for Crota is beyond me. It doesn’t make it challenging, just more annoying, especially when playing with people who don’t know how to communicate properly
Strikes are my raids 😁
Am I the only one that finds raids so confusing and difficult?
Ima be real your teammate overcomplicates things for no reason, in no world should just numbers themselves be used for callouts. It overcomplicates the hell out of the raid for no reason.
Actually you dont need to light the lanterns you only need to preserve the chalice
Remake the pe on how to make them Heroic
This video really is helping my first Crota run since Destiny 1. Thanks
Those chandeliers ruins the game
Do you have a video of guns I should have for raids? I feel like I should collect some more guns before I start doing these.. guns by type and by element. like linier fusion rifle or whatever. best one of each element. and it seems like there are some guns new players will never be able to get because the seasons are done so please dont tell me to get a gun I cant get as a player that started a month ago
Wish I could do this alone
Il never get this done 😵‍💫
First, love and appreciate your videos, second, go back and count and see how many times you say "as you can see" 🤣
AS YOU CAN SEE-
how do u go the CROTAS END  raid
Great now I need a fireteam hopefully that will be easy to do
So from what im seeing is that its impossible to solo ..great
yeah... no thanks
I remember D1 days soloing this on normal and hard everyweek
So when do I use my Rock Band drumset....?
i cant play them u need to many people
I used to be able to solo this raid in Destiny 1. Clearly things have changed. 😂
You explained this like if you are the dummy
You go through this stuff WAY TOO FAST. Slow it doooooooooooown.
This raid is trash
You expunge on Crota you Khaki boy you! lol thanks for the vid bud. I thought there would be some changes here and there.
This videos crap it doesn't even show where you go to get to the raid specially when you're a new player you can find 5 million different videos about how to do the raid but you can't find anyone with intelligence to help you navigate where to find it so much has been added to the game and yet it still forces you into story lines when you log on for the first time in a long time
They really should just remove all this raids difficulties, it makes sense making a little jumping puzzle and needing a team and having to kill a bunch monsters. But just remove all that chalice Og light shit. It makes no sense and it confuse everyone! And for people like me I can't even play crotas end cause I have no way of remembering all this information you just gave! And joining a team where you have to watch a video while playing will get kicked. It took me so many times to fix ally do it once and I just wanted necrochasm only to find out I need to do it 10 times more! But I used 3 days and over 16 hours to do it once. It's just not fair for guys like me we can't get the cool looking armor or the best weapons in the game simply because we can't do puzzles which have absolutely nothing with being a guardian to do. I am going to try crotas again today so wish me luck I want the machinegun and necrochasm!
As you can see... this is a great tutorial. Thanks
Hey! Nice vid. What shader was that on Cartesian?
Just watched this video, and I'm in an lfg fireteam, and it's my first time. Final encounter. I tell the guys it's my first run-through, and they are like "bro how come people expect to know what to do just from watching a video" like bro why do you think I said it my first time
could that last person just have shatter/well skate across the gap?
had to watch guide cuz all lfg has the KWTD tag
Guys I need your help to do chota I never done this or any raid
Rick "Crota-Crushing" Kackis, because of your raid and dungeon guids I have been allowed into the "kwtd" lfg groups so thank you so much
So I can’t super jump the dark room, despawn the enemies on the bridge, cheese the deathsinger and make Crota stay down on one knee forever? Nah this ain’t Crotas End I know 😂😂😂😂
Me and my guys got it everything correct on our first try😂tho it was a pain in the ass we still managed didn’t a wipe a single time
Oh shit! They brought back everyones favorite Strike!!! I mean... Nightfall...
I want to mention two things you did not the lanterns can explode and when you get past those walls if you're fast enough there's a chest on the other side of the end of that room before you drop in the hole
didn't you use the hack to bypass the mechanics on the bridge encounter like we did in d1
bless his heart for acting this excited still over these basic mechanics after all these years.
yap
As you can see...  well done, thanks for the tutorial
Is there any way to get a random drop of husk of pit without the raid , I had a stroke a year ago , and I’m not the best to play raids
This is the Raid that made Ghllahorn famous
I remember when this launched on  destiny 1. I went in blind at launch. Having to figure out everything on the way was such an awesome experience
Destiny 2 ruined this raid
Kinda wish you could still do this solo without a team like you could in D1 until you get to a point.. (i dont have anyone that could help me with raids)
Hi dummy here - " as you can see, shoot the oversoul" - what? where? The moon? And did not understand the "expunge" at the end - how did u get that buff?
DID YOU SAY 0:06 For dummies SO IF WE ARE,YOU MUST BE THE LOSER THEN..
These raid mechanics be too complicated 😩
Is there a discord I can join which has lots of people on it that would help me do raids?
Im surpised nobody on your team used Merciless. Conserve Momentum seems like it would just chew Crota and his Wizards up
So it's crota but pass the baton?
My problem with this game is communication in raids etc.. the game volume is so loud even turned down to 1 and people's voices are so quiet its Impossible to hear whats going on
This is great and all but where the hell is this raid and or pre reqs cas ever guide I've seen has started inside the raid
The changes to this raid make me not wanna do it at all. Im probably the only one that finds these buffs/debuffs complete bs along with the chalice mechanic the whole raid. Raids used to be fun. Seems over complicated for no reason. And considering most lfgs want insane clears or just have a bunch of impatient jerks, here is yet another raid I wont be completing.
Honestly... i tried to do it with an lfg group and they ruined this raid
yeah forgetting that new weapon can't play the game mode with other people because it will not turn on matchmaking flagging your video and you're getting reported for hacks
how are you posed to team up with people of matchmaking is turned off get recorded
I can’t find the raid anywhere! Where do I find it?
This guy calls everyone who watches his video Dummies and gets away with it 🤣🤣🤣
No room for hunters this raid…
Also, pop the well on top of Crota bc he’ll break it if u don’t
Nope. Don’t miss it at all. Payday 3 here I come.
U make everything sound complicated
I aint doin allat im the number 1 most casual d2 player in the world.
So my question would be then how are you supposed to solo The Raid if somebody else has to take the buff from you or you'll die?
So us solo players can do it LMAO
Bruh why couldn’t they just keep it how it was. This mechanic makes everything worse
Where is crota raid which planet ? I’ve been looking everywhere
Do my eyes deceive me or are there actual time stamps in this vod? Congrats on finally incorporating time-stamping in your vods.
Now all I need is friends to play this with smh
What is that auto rifle bro has in the second encounter??
Just came back to playing it and had to learn what has changed haven't did no raids yet
bungie: give us 100$ so we can reuse old content. us: ok
Great breakdown.  ty.
HOW,... in the name of all that is unholy is this 'fun'? i think i've had more enjoyable migraines!
Can you farm this for weapons every week? Or only the first run do weapons drop?
Do you have to expunge or is that just for extra dps?
Right before crota dies at the end of the raid he should teleport to that empty room under the spawn, throw his sword to block the entrance and use that circle pool to regain some health. Then teleport back for the final stage.
In the first Encounter, how do you know which way to go. I ran it today for the first time but they wouldn't really tell me what to do or how to do it. On top of that, it seemed like they just went into any direction that had a Lantern. I swear we did the same Lantern 3 times. I remember it because there is a rock in front and a hole directly behind the rock.
Remember this was on contest mode. Survivability might not be as big of an issue now
Its basically been 9 years since ive done this😅
Is there a dps timer before wipe if you dont Start dps or not? Like to Ir Yut
i hope they will add wraith of the machine at some point, my favourite raid xD
Hey man just wanted to say this really helped me a lot I like how you thoroughly go through the steps little by little especially for slow learners like myself.
im still kinda confused on bridge bahahaha so chalice and sword go over together for the first one, chalice goes back over once 1 person gets enlightened, and from there does chalice stay on beginning side till the last 2 people?
1st encounter is legit the hardest part, people have no patience.  4 LFGs in a row abandoned after just 3 or 4 tries of getting through.
Thanks so much for this. Amazingly helpful. Now I just need to not die
Gratr video man thansk for all the help.
In other words I can’t play it solo
The things they do to make it non solo 👎
so you cant just swordfly across the bridge now??? damn i would 2 man crota with my buddy on d1 regularly.
Makes me happy seeing this, remember doing Crotas raid in the OG destiny game
Deja vu
awesome!
always appreciate this content. these videos always age well because I always end up watching them 2-3 times throughout the years as I forget raid mechanics.
It just looks like a nightmare!!!
Imo this just makes destiny one look all so much better.
"Boomer Patrol" Is what I call it when my dad walks around the block looking for things to get grouchy about.
14:13 I wonder if Thunder crashing across is still possible. 🤔
After all these years he’s back
Cool weapons locked behind the raid….sucks
Suspend the gatekeeper and then try to hit him like he's a goddamn pinata wow great raid design, swords absolutely fuckin suck against a suspended enemy I wonder if stasis is better
What auto is he using in the first encounter?
I watched 3 walkthrough videos, and while waiting for this kackis to finish his intro
Can someone explain oversoul to me? I was put on that last night in a raid lfg and it didnt let me expunge, I have no idea what I did wrong.
Is there still a bonus chest in the Shrieker Hallway?
These mechanics are dumb....  Lone wolves/ filthy casuals don't have a chance once again.
Thanks for that ❤
these memories overcome me. a once forgotten time is brought back.
That's why i never do Any old raids worlds first cause PC NOOBS ALWAYS DO IT FIRST LIKE THEIR PC WAS ON SOME COCAINE OR STUFF😂😂😂😂😂
35:28 😩
Would be nice to have friends lol.. 😢
Besides lament, legend of acrius is still a solid option (but need the catalyst)
@ Kakis I wonder do you think arbalest could work to remove the shield from crota then do super damage with swords. Or does it only work with dungeon bosses?
gotta "love" how every F**** post on bungies lfg is KWTD,
Nobody:  Rick Kackis: “AS YOU CAN SEE”
Ri-cactus
When the original crota raid dropped my team came 5th in the world on time taken .
Tip: Crota is unable to break Sanguine Alchemy empowering rift. If the team has two elementals, for example, half void and half solar, then one solar and one void Warlocks with Sanguine Alchemy can provide the damage boost for solar and void swords.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
Why didnt they just re-release original crota. This "new" crota is doodoo
The vehicle radar callout is a really good call tbh for the witches. Just in case, wishender helps see through the walls too
I remember watching your first crotas end for dummies before school, here I am 8 years later. Thanks rick you legend
yo wtf is a riggamoral
Watching you heavy swing that give sword over and over like some kind of newb physically pains me @kackishd
At the very start you can check the statues to unlock red border chest
Your not selling it
Great vid. Watched and shared with clan. I spent the first 7 minutes saying "Oh, THAT'S how it works". Thank you, thank you, thank you.
What would be the best loadout and super for Titan in the 3rd encounter?
wish i had friends to do this with
Do we get glowhoo on 1st complete???????
I know people try and get guides out quickly, but since contest is only active for 48 hours, it'd be nice to see raid guides based around no contest mode as well. Things are easier, but the strats probably change ever so slightly
Husk quest is bugged amcannot progress the kills
Ah yes 39 minutes video
Where do you pick up the quest? Seems like one should stumble across it if only by accident since absolutely no one talks about it but I can't find it anywhere.
Enlightment kinda lame
I wonder how wrong this video gets things.
So it's still the same raid only added the chalice to prevent the solos and made the deathsinger encounter a real encounter
You fucking rock dude
I wonder if they did the first buff to open the bridge before you jump down the portal so people can’t solo crota as easy I couldn’t get past the first part on my own which was disappointing 😂🤣😂
Chicken sandwich
Loved grinding the old raid for the ornaments! Can't wait to get the gear (that looks the exact same lmao) this time around 🙌
Fun idea. Run crota's end, taking shots everytime he says "as you can see"
If you use stasis on the gate keeper you can push them all off making the encounter free
So much more testing needs to be done with expunge. I refuse to believe they put it in the raid for no reason and it looks like you can do it on wizards and crota?
BUNGIE continually over complicating things
bungie did a good job with this
Thank you so much for this I can’t wait to do this with my friends. How would pyrogale gauntlets work for dps? Is it worth it considering you can just swap back to your legs and get soul invictus healing from ads?
❤
Thanks kakis
LFG is gonna go like this "Can you run cenotaph and well?" "No i like arc warlock"  "Yo titan can you run phoenix cradle?" "Nah I haven't beat the shadowkeep campaign"  "Aiite bet"  *Closes game*
my team cant even do enough dps (on ir yut)
After 2nd damage it whipes like 70% of the time for no reason.
Contest mode is not for Dummies
3000+ kills on a tractor cannon is criminal 💀
loved D1 crotas end. i absolutely HATE D2 crotas end, they essentially turned a good raid into a chalice minigame that has nothing to do with the raid, then say 'use it or else'. its so tedious, boring, poorly designed and repetitive.
Watching this makes me not wanting to play this raid 😅
37:14 i like how crota's watching them from upstairs
What a Shame ! Bloody destiny never change old sh ts same same same
Prefer d1 version too much pissing about in the new 1
For the bridge, u can just get everyone enlightened on the first side instead of going back and forth with the chalice (assuming no one will die before they pass the bridge with a sword).
21:29 I like how you say you and your team. Emphasizing that it all of you to draw that.
You missed the Expunge mechanic
I miss the days of solo-ing this raid 😢
Rick kackis is clutch af
Looks like no more solo clears for this raid. Fireteams up. Great guide as usual
You can also blind and use stasis on the second encounter to defeat the gatekeepers. Blind makes it very easy.
There's secret chest in lanterns my team found it I don't know if anyone else found it but its around the halfway point to the left behind a door but the door is open with a chest in like a little hallway
How do I start this raid do I have to complete certain missions to start the raid or no
This raid is di do now  likes it the ild wast
funny cause u didnt even beat the raid day1
that chalice buff is just annoying unnecessary mechanic raids is annoying enough without it
i was beyond lost through out the whole thing😅
Thats it
Wait why did they have to get 1 more sword to finish off the overshield…?? I thought the swords had unlimited ammo?? What am I missing during the crota fight
Crotas End was my first raid I ever did.
O god how did they ruin this raid
Wheeew… I’m tired just from watching
So you’re saying that you can’t solo the raid
😩
What heavy machine gun are you using?
So basically they Made it where you can't Solo the raid smh
We weren't able to beat Crota, the adds kept killing us alongside crota. It never once occurred to me that we could use pheonix in the middle and cradle for survival. We only managed to reach damage phase once, and we only did like a tenth of crota's health. The others had to go to bed, but I'm gonna try for like 3 or four more hours with randos to see if at least I can get it and let the others know if the exotic is worth it/the instant exotic was worth the abstract p a i n.
Man, this chalice swapping thing appears awfully tricky and confusing as hell….. But of course, this is Destiny 2 not 1, so of COURSE Bungie just has to intensify the Raid. (Presumably the same with Vault of Glass, King’s Fall, which I’ve honestly only ran in D1, not a single 1 I. D2 for said reason(s).  I’m really a bit of a casual PVE bounty runner, Strikes, etc…..)  I’m curious if any old Raid gear returns other than the armor and Necrochasm.  I’m honestly itching to mess around with Hunger of Crota again seeings for the longest time Ghallarhorn simply just wasn’t dropping for me until a couple weeks before nerf, Crota’s End being the 1st Raid I’ve run and completed so many times I’ve just gotten so used to it, just as I got really easily comfy with Iron Gjallarhorn in D1 and obviously D2, literally dedicated (all) day 1 drop to get it including catalyst.
So I can’t get to the pit by myself…noted 🥲
you left out a lot of important things, but that's to be expected. your guides have always been dog water.
this guide misses a lot of useful mechanic info
Ok so why is my team wiping even after hitting the damage threshold? We don’t get it
This is a very bad guide.  Very incomplete and badly explained. Go watch someone else. Anyone.  This is a loss of time.
Didn’t even explain expunging on ir yut bruh
Cartesian still putting in the work after so many seasons 😂
Yellow bar 🅱️oomers
Destiny really said f u to solo raiders with this raid 😂
Congrats of the Raid clear. Also getting the guide up so fast had a major impact on views.  Again thanx for all you do.
W video, Your raid guides are awesome
Well damn 😮
As someone who 3 manned lanterns after 8 hours of trying to get there cause of the traps killing us... I can say it's an easy encounter if you just don't die
Can you get the day 1 emblem by just getting a crota boss checkpoint and defeating him then doing the challenges? Or do you have to do every encounter and then challenges?
The sweet business auto rifle is overpowered
The plate is not letting my group enlighten it, are we doing something wrong?
So yeah.... I accepted the fact I'll never get the exotic
Releasing this video while contest mode is still ongoing is an utter insult and mark of disrespect to all the community who put in the time and ingenuity to work it out for themselves! You and the other creators have made the emblem worthless, as 95% of the ppl who'll now get it have cheated!
How about sherpas
Are you happy now destiny community? You’ve now got a challenging raid that’s too difficult
Do what the first clan who best it did.... Run the raid on D1, same map same strategy, only with the new version all the new modifiers are added. We ran both today.
wait, what do I do with the boomers? I don't think I heard you talk about those...................
Do you think we can do a raid sometime? Cacus like I'm looking for a friend to do raids with. I haven't done an umbrella too often but I would love to learn them.
Can you do it solo
the first encounter is the worst in this whole RAID...
I actually like the first part with the lanterns because that part in D1 was so easy I soloed it up with void invis hunter and a sniper that used to turn you invisible also , forgot the name of it . The new way is better , you actually gotta fight your way up
What about expunge? When enlightened you can interact with ir yut to expunge her
Rick is the Ali-A clickbait yt scamming monetization of the destiny community. Avoid this guide and wait for Datto or Fallouts guide. Kuckis didn’t even go into how to stop Ir Yut. TRASH!
Is this supposed to be fun?? No thanks 🙏
The wizard room numbers are numbered so stupidly I stg this video is gonna cause so many issues for lfg’s 😂
What took u so long ?
Why couldn't they just keep it the same?😭😭😭😭
If u get to a 3rd phase on deathsinger what does the sixth person do with the chalice just preserve it? Also do I need to do it twice to get necrochasm or just once in contest mode?
Great info! Always great guides! One thing id like to note is to make these simpler, in the bridge encounter you can have everyone elightened before anyone crosses. This prevents the constant stress of juggling.  Full explanation: Divide it up into 4 roles, -Starter (x1) -Passers (x2) (Eventual-swordbear) -Defenders (x2) -Ender (x1)  (Starter) grabs 1st chalice, next the first (Passer) grabs next and "passes" it to (Defender). Once defender is ready, 2nd (Passer) gives it to 2nd (Defender). (Defender) then passes it to (Starter) to ensure he keeps enlightenment then finally, gives it to the (Ender). (Ender) is the person to group cross with chalice while one partnered with one of the 2 (Passers) who can be swordbearer. Once sword + chalice is banked, everyone will have enlightenment and no one needs to juggle
Anyone else get to about 15mins in and thought, yea I can't be arsed to do this shit. The changes to VoG were great, these Crota changes tho, nah, no thanks. Good luck to everyone tho
I don’t understand why people didn’t run Vesper, made everything so much easier
oof not really a "complete raid guide" if you don't go over the challenges too...
You & Datto were in such a hurry to get your videos out that you both didn't even mention where the two hidden chests were.
Do you pay something to get the raid or is it free
Wow so much gets missed in the video
They keep limiting the scope of solo players can play. Now there's no other raids you can solo. I remember back in D1 soloing this all the time. Now with the chalice mechanic that's impossible now. I hate what Destiny has become
And as usual, another confusing, ill-prepared and excessively long guide from Rick Kackis lol.
Ez raid love it
This is random but I wish they’d add ghost dialogue throughout the raid itd give it more depth imo
I HIGHLY recommend a flash bang grenade for the second encounter. It lasts a really long time against the gatekeeper
My team called the little nodes in the first encounter checkpoints
At least it's not too complicated. SMH
Yo tell them next raid no lfg 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyr time this Alvin and the Chipmunks looking mferr says "hOwEveR" I die inside
So the magic of crota damage phase is gone..
Can the host unplug the router for dps? 😅
Is there only one secret chest that came back?
How do you get 5 people enlightened on ir yut without killing the last one with chalice from having it too long
Nice video as usual. I love ur detailed drawing of the rooms 😂.
Can you get the necrocasm by just beating the boss? Or do you need to complete every encounter??
Still impossible for me, solo is hard. Also what does the Two-Tailed-Fox’s catalyst do? I just got the weapon.
You're are legendary and essential for the community. Thanks khakis!!
From what I can see, this new raid is awesome compared to the original version! Crota doesn't seem to be soloable and is actually a tough battle. No telling how he is outside of conquest, but he looks hard to beat.
they made this raid so hard to lfg
For our run of 3rd encounter what really helped was we had one person calling the witch spots bc he was using Wishender to look through the walls. He was invis hunter for survivability. Also you can juggle enlightened into the damage phase to expunge on that boss, it's well worth it. If you're getting inconsistent damage with rockets go div and linears, way easier and still easily locks down the damage cap.
Ahhhh yet again they make another raid with stupid extra mechanics to make it that much harder & to find a solid group to get it done in 6-12 hrs lol
You lost me on the first mechanics😅
Realizing that we won't be able to do this one solo
U can do a normal hit with the sword, heavy super another normal hit, heavy so u can do like 75% of the shield
Imagine it took 1 man to complete this raid 8 years ago 😮
I got to crota yesterday we can not did it maybe on week one be more ez crota is a big pain
to anyone being the wizard scouter role in 3rd encounter, void hunter with stylish executioner gives wish ender wallhacks with way more range and more ease of use
Thanks for always doing this it’s appreciated
Too much instructions and tasks to do for a old recycled raid. I think i may pass
Who has the chalice when the three people that crossed are now on their platforms keeping the bridge formed?
Ricks the 🐐🐐
khakis the goat
This reprisal is probably the most obnoxious variant I have ever witnessed.  I understand the original was super easy, a laughable time.  However this ? Just wow.. smh
“As you can see”   Good lord stop saying that.  Yea we can see - it’s a video
Can we not use dummies ? It's kinda rude call people can we at least say guide for new players
a shame I won't be playing it until the fun stuff is reenabled
where xur video
They ruined this raid
for bridge our team just had full tractor cannons and a tether to blind the gate keepers they can’t attack when they blomd
Kackis got carried hard😂
Legend of Acrius chunks his health a little better then swords.
Fun fact, I'm pretty sure light light heavy is the most damage dealing combo on Sword Relics
The dumbest thing you can call a title.Players that play the game aren't dumb, they just don't have the time nor the patience to teach others or learn it. So please for your fan base it's counter intuitive to call us dummies. Here is a thumb nail, RAID GUIDE FOR FIRST TIMERS. you see, no insults given.
You can cheese the first encounter 😂, just send someone with fast charging invis to the end and the enemies stop spawning
I like these guides but we need less nonsense between the steps. I like to just learn the encounter and before or after explaining how to do the encounter, then say what would be best to use for the encounter. Explaining the encounter while saying what you can use confuses me, making me rewatch the same part till I understand whats happening in the actual encounter. Not hating, just wish you'd change it up to make it a little less confusing then again I appreciate a video explaining it while contest is out so this video is perfect atm
so what you are saying is that this cant be done solo
Where do I go to start the raid?
To make it easy use wishender in the witch incounter
If you could make a new Hive-based / Weapon Of Sorrow Exotic weapon, what would you want it to be and do?
How long does this raid take
Crota mechanic so easy but if you are like me micless even as destriny vet its just a pain to find a grp :D
Thank you for taking your time to show us this D1 raid <3
Another raid I that so DANM cool that I can't even do
I believe you missed an opportunity to say "This is Kackis, Son or Rick!"
Another great raid video!! Kinda sad you didn’t say it’s ya boi Crota kackis lol but all good!
These mechanics are ridiculous
You’re such a gigachad for doing this🤙🏼
Hoped on solo, believing it like d1.
This day 1 raid experience made me realize that the raid itself is not hard.. just that there are seriously stupid and impatient people in lfg
I swear im the only person in D2 who finds relic juggling and shit like it, not fun. I'd rather it was exactly the same as D1 and the challenges just being really hard for world first.
Yesssss babbbyyy dis what i was waiting foooorrr
Dude thank you so much for making this guide and putting it out so early! Hoping to beat it
For a second I thought your intro was going to be “it’s ya boi Rick-crotus here.”
Can u get the quest by only beating the boss?
So I have a question… so this is kinda a dumb question but do we have to do the whole raid in order to get nechrochasm or can we just defeat crota?
No Jumping puzzles. Warlocks rejoice. 😁
For dummies? Exactly what i needed. lol
This guide is awful. He constanrly stumbles over his words and goes on tangents. I'm so lost
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO RICK!! I truly appreciate your uploads man, keep it up bro! 👊 I hope I can complete this Raid to get that juicy juicy Emblem 😭
You are a G
How did you do this that quickly?
Yeah you missed a lot in this like how to stop ir yut. Also mentions his team skipped a latern but doesn't show us how. And makes it sound like well is required for bridge encounter. Stop making these guides, just it can be the first one. 🙄😑
Equipping a sword is not a good idea, the tracking will kill you.
They made the raid non solo-able
So sad, they ruined a great raid with new shitty mechanics, d2 is trash anyways 😂
Dark LiTurdGee
I was here, and i’ll be back here for years to come 😁
Here's a tip for the 3rd encounter: if you can't find the wizards, you can ude wallhack abilities to see them like from wishender or hunter stuff.
Quick tip, when the fifth enlightened person runs across with a sword, the 6th person can run across with the chalice and they can deposit it in the cauldron, and then they can be the support super person for the gatekeeper battle at the end
If this sword works like other hive swords light light heavy is better than mindlessly mashing heavy attack.
It's funny how the d1 raids bring the stupid outta ppl WARLOCK I the only support class 😂😢😂😢😂 but in this video it's a damn TITAN destiny 2 players cmon now
Thanx Rick "As you can see" Kackis
Encounter 3 sleeper 2 phase
Is it just me or did they make the hellmouth look a lot less deep in D2
Can you thundercrash over the wall at the lantern encounter? I used to jump from a light to the top in d1 all the time and skip like 40% of the running
Lamps all i know is lamps
Thanks for putting this together... but that is way too much to digest. That looks really not fun. At least you finished it. Unlike 100% of people on PS5/Xbox... bruh.
How would we clear any raids without you
I literally can’t play this raid because everyone on LFG is either extremely incompetent and doesn’t listen or just leaves straight away, I was stuck on the lantern encounter for 9 hours because literally nobody was listening to how the mechanics worked….it’s absolutely ridiculous
This is perfect! SOOOOO MANY DUMMIES TRYING TO DO THIS RAID RN😂
The hardest part to beating this raid is, FINDING COOL PEOPLE TO DO IT WITH 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ everyone acts like they’re too good to help folks out.
Dawg I gotta say, I don’t get the hype with this raid, first time I played it and any time since, the ONLY part I had fun with was the final boss fight. I enjoyed Wrath of the Machine more than this 😭😭😭 here’s hoping they redo THAT raid
How can Rick be a full grown adult and still pronounce Guillotine wrong…
I hope they make trials harder for pve players ,they make the raid harder for us pvp people but want to give pve players two mercy’s out and don’t penalize backing out of matches just to farm for engrams
Ah Bruh..., 4 (four) Shadebinder's with Osmiomancy Gloves plus Bleak Watcher plus Whisper of Rending plus Wish-Ender and 2 (two) Dawnblade's with Well of Radiance and Phoenix Protocol.  The team will have easy full Crowd Control, the battlefield full of stasis turrents and frozen enemies.  The gatekeeper, the Shadebinder can keep it frozen indefinitely with Cold Snap and stasis turrents, so easy to deal with those enemies.
The thing bro
IM A DUMMY, I NEED THIS ❤❤❤
I just wish I wasn’t working I wanted the challenger emblem :(
This sounds like the most annoying part of Skolas, but more of a pain in the ass, and for the entire duration of the raid.
“Making content is hard” 😂
Appreciate it, like other guides, I'll watch and never find a decent team
They ruined Crota with a stupid juggle mechanic. It’s not harder it’s just annoying
That pic showing the callouts was the most detailed artistic thing I've ever seen
Do you really have to have the 'for dummies!' in the name? :p
tysm for the guide rick !!
New drinking game, drink every time he says “As you can see” or says something annoying (which is every time he opens his mouth)
hardest raid I've tried.  screw contest mode
So question real quick my mate and I found that with strand you can literally go to the end, do you reckon since we were trying to two man it we didn't have enough people to enlighten or do the lanterns need lit
Wow I absolutely hate this new mechanic it wasn’t nesseaary just kills the fun
This raid will be annoying with all these no mics in LFG.  Get on the comms you anti social hooligans when you are raiding.
no offense to your numerical system you guys made for ir yut, but my team just used “right top, right bottom, left top, left bottom, back left, back mid, and back right” as its far more easy of a descriptor than making an entire team remember and number a set of rooms.
Rick "AIAT" Kackis
This raid just don't feel the same without black hammer.
What does expunging on ir yut do, is it extra damage or just to get rid of enlightened if needed?
Wow! They really went balls to the wall with mechanics! The original was far too simple but they might have gone a little overboard with these changes.
This is ridiculous!
Hmmm sounds too complicated!
I wonder how many mistakes will be in this one
Great video.  Thanks!
wheres my DONT TOUCH ME's!
so much for soloing the raid.
Can’t believe our favorite D1 strike is back
My main question is in third Encounter is that the chalice has a debuff counter. If you hold it too long you die. So how do you survive the third encounter when you get people enlightened? The debuff timer will run out when your getting Everyone to their wizards? Can you preserve it somewhere?
Vesper of radius is a godsend for that middle room during the Ir Yut part
Crotas End: Hot Potato Edition
Credit where it’s due, Rick always manages to put these guides together super quick, which are a must for anyone going through LFG.
Kackis is Crotas End!!!! Thank you for your time and amazing videos. I was stuck on Lantern phase for 6 hours with no idea how to advance. Keep up the great work and rooting for you to get worlds first always
Nice Rick thank you for the info 😅
Am i the only one who gets psyched to do a raid. Watches guide. Then halfway thru guide say solid pass?
I still don't have teammates
So it’s not easy like the d1 version? :(
Been a fan since D1. This is why you're the GOAT!
🗣️ AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!!
You can destroy oversoul again and again but you need to have enlighten buff so when final phase make sure all ppl have this buff and destroy oversoul again and again
Can’t wait for well to be nerfed. It’s crazy how much it’s needed..
I don’t have the patience for this mess ‘ 🤣
Weaken also blinds the gatekeepers
Holy shift this video makes me feel so old. I remember making Facebook videos on how to solo the entire raid. Good times
Minor correction. The Engulfed in Darkness debuff is personal. It doesn’t raid wipe, it just wipes you out when it hits zero. Everyone just starts out with the same time. Learned that when reviving other Fireteam members.
How do you get the option to start the raid? I’m so confused
I hate the new mechanics for this raid it’s an unintuitive mess
Bridge Encounter: easiest way for us was everyone got Enlightened buff at the beginning,  chalice and sword go over, drop a well/blind/suspend/stasis turrets kill Blue Knight, then deposit,  next player comes over, repeat
Appreciate the video Kackis
For this raid, my fireteam had two Renewal Hunters providing support and ad clearing. Shit was impressive with how tanky they were, especially with Ir Yut.
The original raid mechanics were better and that first encounter was so much better when it was much darker
Day 1 of this was so much fun. Bungie did a FANTASTIC job at updating this raid. :)
Ok how about solo
Great video.  Disappointed in bungie for making this impossible for solo players to even get into though.
Seeing the raid is the reason why I feel it's a terrible idea to nerf Wells as saltygreppo desperately wants. Unless they rework every raid where trying to DPS the boss doesn't turn you into mince meat (since you're out in the open with either a hard hitting boss or a shit ton of adds), it'll be a terrible experience for most of the players.
REMOVE THE PENDELUMS BUNGIE!!!!!!!!
I was able to solo the other side of bridge with devour by slamming heavy next to the door until the gatekeeper died but i also seen a clip of someone getting him to fall off the map
Anyone on xbox wanna do it
rick the goat
Bruhhhhhhhhhh if I hear rigamarole one more time hahahahaha
The map in the final CP got me. outstanding 😆
Thanks
Does anybody know if you can just do a crota checkpoint and skip the nechrochasm quest or if you have to do the entire raid?
We got to deathsinger and my raid team was getting Soo mad.. we had to take a break
No black hammer?
How long it takes for the challenge if done right?
When the witness arrives we will rely on “what’s going on guys it’s ya boy Rick Kackis”
I do kinda like the buff option it makes you have to have good communication and it's a good solution to people being able to solo it i also like how this raid needs a lot of player engagement no one can really say ill just ad clear.
So did you get the exotic right after?
Oh my god it sounds like bungie made this raid as tedious as possible
"Tell the Boomer Patrol, Stop Killing" - Boomer Killer Kackis
Looks fun.  Ty for the instructions
So how do you do the Descend into the Hellmouth Solo???
U know one thing that annoys me about the first encounter is the lanterns don't make humming boom noise when the lantern is about to explode
These new mechanics seem more annoying then challenging.
These new mechanics seem more annoying then challenging.
Crazy how quickly this review got out
Thank you so much for timestamps you gou’ve gotten a million subs!!!
This is very well explained. This has to be one of your best guides.
dude! Its my favorite destiny commentator! RickAddictedtoCrackis
The changes to Vault of Glass were welcomed and appreciated… The changes to this Raid are simply ridiculous and obnoxious!… Bungie needs to change these mechanics…  Good job by Bungie Trolling us. This raid is honestly stupid and a waste of time.
Me and the boys grinding first encounter for 12 hours failing 67 times.
Dang who finished it first?
24:43 huh
You can use abar warden, newer exotic titan chest piece and have the strand barricade in your nade to suspend him and you can still use a shackle grenade, during that time with tier 10 resil you'll have another barri-nade to suspend him again, you can go back and forth with the shackle grenade and barri-nade to suspend spam
Man I was doing the sword across the bridge solo and barely able to kill him solo but the teams I was with couldn't kill him even with me there
So on the lanterns can you just grapple to the end with the chalice?
for ir yut how's was the 6th person gonna get enlighten to dunk if there are 5 wizards u need to take out
Crota aint called a sword breaker for nothing
this is why i don’t like d2 raids, the dogwater raid mechanics. what a joke
I understand why Banner of War was disabled now
GUYS had no one played D1?? If you sit behind the cover right as you get across the bridge to the left, the gatekeeper runs right off the map
I would recommend using a sword and strand in the first encounter, saved me a lot
So what happened I nodded off 😆
Feel like this will be alot easier once contest is gone! Think the new mechanics caught a lot of people out and a high damage check on the bosses but I’d expect a lot of people will be able to get ir yut and Crota past half health without really thinking about it! Mechanics seem like once you have done it once the raid will be simpler than what it seems
I wish this looked fun to do.
I think I preferred the old version of the Raid.
I remember watching your first crotas end for dummies before school, here I am 8 years later. Thanks rick you legend
Is necrochasam guaranteed if you just beat crota
This is a great video! Thanks Rick Kackis!
Rick out here doing gods work like a champ give this man a like🙌🏻
yeah F all that noise
bungie did a good job with this
A Tip for first encounter. For my completion of it, if we dunked the chalice to Preserve, we moved on to the next lantern. We still had x10 but even players who joined in the middle were saying that our way felt quicker
You can freeze the gate keepers and push them off :)
So no more soloing the first encounter
I was disappointed.. i moss the old d1 version when you just kill shit, i hate that pusle part of d2! F that i want to kill shit
I should have saw that coming. I was so hyped for this raid to come back and they have to go and ruin the raid by added stupid mechanic. I just wanted a old school raid that I know how to do and can run it many, many times over. D2 has ruin raid to the point, I dont even raid anymore. Unlike D1 where I was running every raid, every week.  Why did they have to change all of the raid to be worse then D1.
You should rename the title of your video to 'Crota's End Raid for Warlock Dummies' since the whole guide relies on their use.
i really hate that well warlocks are always so mandatory
Changed so much they woulda been better off making a new raid. Embarrassing.
Love it when Rick kackis makes guides. ❤
Don't you need the chalice in the other side to build the bridge after 3 ppl go across? Since you need 3 enlighten to build the whole bridge
Goat tier Kackis 🙌🏾
what's your reccomendation for hunter players during this raid?
It’s sad this game doesn’t have matchmaking for some modes, I don’t have friends that play Destiny 2 they just should make matches with random players that wants to do the Raid.
I figured out a cheese for the abyss encounter that’s actually insanely good but I was hoping it would be in this video
Guess there will be no solo efforts with that chalice type mechanic
That enligtened mechanic is trash
Just out of curiosity, which one of your teammates pulled their ethernet cable to cheese their raid if you’re not an OG D1 player you have no idea what I’m talking about I thoroughly enjoy your content
Just out of curiosity, which one of your teammates pulled their ethernet cable to cheese their raid if you’re not an OG D1 player you have no idea what I’m talking about I thoroughly enjoy your content
whats expunge for on 3rd encounter? everyone seems to have a different idea
Thanks for the guide appreciated Rick
7:07 i would recommend a sword with eager edge :D
While running the first abyss encounter. We had two teammates rush straight to the end, that reduced the spawn of the thralls for the people who are running the challace of light through the route. Also we just move straight to the next lanturn without worrying about the weight of darkness debuff.  whenever we arived to a lanturn that has a deposit spot, we just used the deposit and skipped lighting the lanturn.
Props  for getting this out sooner fast! 💪🏽💯💯
So all those people saying this was harder must have been joking, this whole chalice mechanic is just there to stop you doing it solo, it isn't hard, especially with 6 people you get so much time, theres no risk. Thats so trash dude, why not just make it so you can't launch the raid unless you have a full party ? Or force matchmaking so you have to have 6 people. If they wanr you to do it with a full team why bother with these simple mechanics that add "difficulty" by forcing you to need more than one person ? Its so pointless
Someone should make "Crota's guide to Killing Guardian in Crota's End" " where it's  from Crota'd pov and how to keep guardian from beating him.
Hot Potato: the raid
Thanks rick😉
Gatekeeper got outdated by the new well of radiance and the strand grenade! Well darling we are no longer in 2015 LOL
Wish i'd known about preserving the chalice on the gatekeeper side, my teams solution was to have the sword guy drop the sword, take the chalice and then the previous chalice is enlightened so they can now pick the sword back up and then the previous sword, now chalice player will run back across the bridge
You don’t need to enlighten the bridge 3 times.
so basically no one will ever be able to solo this.
Tether really helps for adds. Really hopeful tip
You can use wish ender to see the wizards through the walls or true sight
Does anyone know if you need to complete the entire raid for nechrocasm, or just kill crota?
So you can’t solo it
She preserve my chalice until I'm enlightened
Huge effort dude
Take a shot each time he say 'however'. you would get liver failure by the end of the video.
"WHAT IS UP GUYS RED COCK IS HERE!"
Congrats to you and your team. And thanks for the guide. Really looking forward to experiencing the raid.
Ngl this raid doesn’t seem like it will be very fun
So basically you don’t have to leave a teammate behind at the bridge, my explanation is long but i hope it helps:   The way you do it is similar to the first set of players crossing the bridge, but do it with the second set of players, so the first 2 players with the sword kill the gatekeeper and plant the sword, and then the other player the one with the chalice dunks it and then head back to switch with another 2 players back at spawn to make them enlightened and then goes back to his teammate with a new sword to plant, now spawn have a chalice they can swap and make someone enlightened and the other with the chalice to go across, they plant the sword after killing the gatekeeper then do it again, dunk and take the chalice, go back to swap it with the remaining 2 players at spawn and you’ll be able to grab a sword because they took the chalice from you and just head back to plant the 4th sword, now the final 2 players basically have the chalice so one swap with the other grab a sword and just both cross the bridge.
Killing the shieldsingers are not what triggers dark liturgy. It’s an invisible timer that ticks from the start of the encounter. It only makes itself known at 45 seconds
For the first (abyss) encounter while building the bridge you don't necessarily need to swap the chalice around for more enlightening. I believe the enlighten after the first one is to speed up the bridge building. My group just preserved the chalice and killed ads while we waited for the bridge to be built.
Wow… another raid where you chain wells. Great. Bungie really needs to put their foot down and nerf it into the ground Lmfao
is it me or are the raid team just being lazy with raids as of late. I am talking about using the same mechanic over and over throughout the raid. A bit of varity would be nice
I can solo d1 crota's end almost four full times in the 39 minutes this guide took 😂
It would be great if they would stop remaking the raids from D1. Now you have to have a fireteam just to be able to complete it since they made it so much harder. Its not worth the headache for the cool armor and they need another way to get it because the raids and dungeons are fucking hard as shit by yourself.  Ive been playing for 3 years, have plenty of good guns and decent armor stats but havent ever been able to get a fireteam to do any raids or dungeons so I always have to pass on the cool shit
No secret chests this time?
Man we spent hours and hours and couldn’t even beat the first encounter. Gona be a long weekend
Do u have to finish it on challenge mode for the emblem ? Or just a normal run through ?
I can't believe we still playing it...
Only did finished 2 raids in D2 in my life but I always watch these videos
For bridge, we found it easier to make 5 people enlightened before crossing first.  first enlightened person that starts the plate building will be last in the rotation and will take chalice across with the first sword. simply dunk the chalice on the other side and no longer worry about swapping buffs since the other side is all enlightened and able to just grab swords and cross. Used on challenge too
I liked the video because this was a lot of hard work. And must've taken forever and you have a new baby and had to spend all day doing this. I mean this is your career and is like a nurse working a double at the hospital. Good job K
“Expunge on Crota” 💀
Vesper of radius blind takes care of gate keeper solo he can’t do anything and I killed him before the blind finished
Holy shit and I thought beating crota in d1 was tricky first month. This shit is crazy lol
Waiting for esoterickks solo video. Cause all my friends quit back in rise of iron 🤣
so no solo? laaaame
can you just do crota for necrocasm
Obviously the contest mode makes it look buff 💪 as hell…
thx for help us.
you can also blind the gatekeepers
we finally arrived at big daddy crota -kackisHD 2023
Does this mean that you can overdose on light and dark?  Considering the new mechanic and all...
I dont think I have the patience to tackle this kind of raid with all these mechanics lol
Just call it a guide. Stop saying "for dummies" please? None of us are and it's kinda rude since we are all here to learn. And thanks for putting this vid out so quickly. I understand it take a lot of work
The good ol Ricky kackis guide I've been waiting for this
Thanks kackis but can you help me cus im low level i know the steps tho
😢 and they did it again to many mechanics. I understand that is the goals of a raid to premote team work and make it a challenge.  But only a small % of players complete a raid and the % will be really small in this one. There needs to be levels of difficulty and rewards to match. Normal should be simple enough that 2 players can carrier the team mechanics wise and teach newer or less skilled players.  With contests mode being nightmare mode.  Theres to many A holes on lfg for a single player to find a team that's not a raid pro. People what to get in and out in a hour. Thats not happening in this one.
WELL NEEDIT
Rip solo unless you can drop chalice easily
Glad to see that they took a great raid and added a super annoying, debuff juggling mechanic to it.
Also how do you get the age of triumph raid armor???
You can expunge Ir Yut, does this do damage like with Crota or what does that do with her in particular?
Is this solo able?
for the bridge encounter the old d1 cheese still works were you can bait the sword guys to jump off the map realy easily making it a lot less risky for contest mode
WTF
18:57 What about the door at the end of the hall with the hidden chest?
is there a chalice deposit area on the Deathsinger?
I didn’t even realise this videos was 40mins long. I’m never clicking on a rickakis video again
Thanks for the vid Khakis! The many toxic LFG guys did terribly in explaining the crota part....
Can u just freeze or blind and push of the knights in the second encounter?? Like the immune guys in vog?
You forgot to show the secret chest on the first encounter
Pay $100 a year for this game just to get the same content you paid twice for 🤦🏾‍♂️
Soo.. no more soloing the first encounter...
Khakis the goat.  Major bungie L making us run the chalice mechanic at every turn encounter. Never had a one mechanic repeat through an entire raid. Not creative.
love ur vids man been watching since levy guide' !
gotta put respect on Kackis name hes a dad beat day 1 and then made a guide like frfr mad respect
Thanks for the vid. Now to watch 10 times and never get to do the raid.
Thank you
Rick-a-ma-role
You MONSTER wasn’t expecting a walk through for us dummies 😢 thank you Rick much love brotha
the pronuonciation of liturgy is "litter G" just say it like that, litter - g. lol they way you are saying it is cringe my guy
Bump
Can’t say I’m shocked that he somehow managed to turn this into a 40 minute video
I was very disappointed when I heard that Crota will be the new raid, but I can say that it is what it should be, this is what a raid should look like, communication and all players should have something to do, everyone should take the Cup for light, coordination for Deathsinger, it's a successful raid, not like in RON where only 2 runners do the job and the rest are clear.. but I'm waiting for the contest mode to end, I don't have the courage to enter this raid with an LFG team on contest mode with many things disabled :))
In the second encounter Assassins cowl hunter with flash bang grenades can go first and solo gate keeper. After that I suggest having the same person have a tractor cannon to debug gatekeepers as players come over.
Light, light, heavy for hive swords. Come on people
thank you daddy rick for getting this out so fast 🫡
Got banned from all multiplayer cause of bad wifi for 2 weeks so stupid
Thumbs up
is this 3 mannable?
What if you use stasis turret warlock on the bridge part? Keeping the gatekeeper frozen for a long time
Nice to have a guide to wake up to lol. You don't disappoint with these RK!
Bro always coming through. Much love 🙏🫡
You can destroy oversoul by shooting it with the knights sword and then load into wrath of the machine
So they basically reversed the damage phase of crota
Thanks Rick to you and your team for making these tutorial videos. Imagine having to do all of these mechanics in D1...that'd be overkill!
is 4 phases even an option or does enrage wipe you after a third phase?
When he says “this one is gonna be a doozy “ 😅.. 😳-smh 😂
This is Raid seems to be impossible for Solo, I tried because I don't have a Raid I can't give away the chalice buff since I'm doing it on my own
Well…your teammate’s drawing is stupid so………👀
The vehicle radar callout is a really good call tbh for the witches. Just in case, wishender helps see through the walls too
How bout you Crota deeznutz!!!!
Also I’ve noticed there’s some statues that you can ignite (2nd encounter)not sure what they’re for
We love u rick!
So quick to get this out
been waiting all day for this vid, thanks :)
I need help with the deathsinger encounter then Croat🥲
bridge, you can expulge the wizard to spawn the orge
thanx good to kno ill only use that horde mode then to get kills if needed to :)
Bro, this why you’ll always be a staple in the community. ✅✅✅✅✅
you're a legend Rick . thank you
Any team of 6 wanna get it done right now.? Drop your bungie ID and ill add you
Just in time Mr Kackis
Tyvm Ricky now get some sleep
Strand player will just yeet
Thank you for the guide
I know people want to get a guide out asap butnid rather them wait and do a proper guide when contest is done. The vast majority of people watching this wont be doing contest, and woukd rather a guide for normal mode.
Quick note: You are able to destroy the Oversoul during final extending the timer to ~9 seconds it will consume your enlightened buff so i recommend going into final with at least 2-3 extra enlightens  Edit: you are only able to destroy the oversoul one time during final use the rest for expunge which deals a little damage
I love your for dummies videos 😅
i hate that warlock Well is going to be heavily needed.
This entire chalice mechanic is to stop you from running the  entire raid solo ..like we did in year one  Bungie missed a real opportunity here they could have left the year one mechanics in but placed in more unstoppables and ain't barriers but if you complete it ya get a special emblem... O well   Looks like the so-called improvements ain't up to much.
Make sure to jump and heavy attack the gatekeeps. Jumping does more damage to them.
I remember solo'ing the Destiny 1 version of this raid the whole raid!
Sooo ters no way to solo it
Wow they done brought back all the Destiny  content from weapons to armor to raids may as well just kept it Destiny since they bringing back everything from the 1st game! Shows they are out of ideaa for this D2! The objective is to move forward with the game not backwards, but okay.......
