Don’t forget this is all fake, shot in a studio………
Marvellous
Reenter??? How when we can't get out Earth atmosphere??? Just plain dumb and dumber
Buang sampah di ruang angkasa😮😢
So you see how clear these camera shots are (video) even in reentry with all that heat ! So why are all videos or shots of objects so blurry on all other platforms!!!! Just odd
WOW!!
Interesting how the camera filming this is not effected in the least from the oppressive “re-entry” environment.
Watched this video a 2nd time on November 3rd, 2025
I go to outer space 🪐 in my dreams almost every night And im getting emotional watching this
They couldn't  find a real man for cometaty?
AI idiots! not real video!
How fucking stupid. Big fucking deal! 😂😂😂😂
That big crowd noise is loud
IT NEVER LEFT EARTH ORBIT BECAUSE OF THE INPENETRABLE FIRMAMENT THAT COVERS EARTH.
最近よく聞くこの変なナレーション本当に邪魔。
You know these people are paid to cheer.
I’m height sick but this is really great to see in real time..way to go! 🚀
What were the small particles of debris flying around at the start of the video?
Space X Can't surpass Earths Atmosphere...So how can You watch it Reenter Earths Atmosphere????? Obama and " Astronots" have admitted it. They say recently......the New Orion Rockets are going to allow "Astronots" to finally go past low Earth orbit........because of the Radition...from the Van Allen Radition belt.....DA! How did they do it in 1969???????? Wake up SHEPPLE!....🐑🐑🐑🐑
Applause for what?? It's physics. WOWEEE. People get more horny for over-paid athletes and spaceships than what's more to life.
❤ Hi Elon
タコが
Fascinating with great narration!
You guys believe anything...  So sad... Ai . CGI.  We will never make it out of this
Lol nice CGI. Isn't this from a video game? It is!
Maybe  we  could  get  some one  a little  less  GAY
Y is the camera always pointing or turned to the side or corner of the spaceships they send up, all this tech and they can't get a decent picture or video of outer space....is they hiding something or is it all fake😮🤔🤷🏾‍♂️
Coming in from space crystal clear yet, - we can't get a clear ungrainy picture of the robber at the corner store.
Wonderful.
All that stuff flying off Starship is not good. Lol AND, did it survive re-entry?
Для дураков ?
3:25🎉4:13 大気圏突入🔥
Extremely well thought out.
That is no starship. Nor did it actually go into space. It just in upper atmosphere. Bunch of hype. Go to the moon, THAT would be going into space
Ceramic tiles: should be in refrigerators AND foam insulation in an aluminum chassis and carbon fiber body. But does anyone want to save on the electric bill?: No? Then you can have a piezoelectric charger on the hinges of the refrigerator door. And then after I say it, I get the opportunity to get killed off by exposure in the state of Kansas. Well, not exactly.
The camera so very strong  It's totally scam
The greatest technological achievement of our era in the field of aerospace. Yet there are still some naive people who believe that Neil Armstrong and his crew walked on the moon in 1969. 😂
Subhanallah......
Pero por qué los vídeos lo ponen ya dentro de la estratósfera,por qué no desde afuera en el espacio negro y vacío para ver la tierra completa de una vez por todas
Don’t we have better shit to worry about????

What's the bits and pieces flying off?
後ろうるさい😢
Il titolo?? NON è uscita dall atmosfera, al rientro sarebbe bruciata.
the plasma on reentry is a lot less violent as most animations make it look like. they always make it look like flames enveloping and blowing of the heat shield while this looks more like a blanket that stays below the surfaces of the atmosphere facing side. Pretty interesting

THE DATA SAYS WE ARE AT 105 KM, ALMOST 10 TIMES THE DISTANCE YOU CAN SEE CURVATURE. WELL IV HELD A RULER ACROSS THE HORIZON AT 105 KM & ITS AS STRAIGHT AS MY RULER. WHERE IS THE CURVATURE? NO, GENUINLY, CAN ANY1 TELL ME WHY THERE IS NO CURVATURE?

are you watching this in a bar? what's with all the idiots yelling in the background?
How you can film this during reentry with all the heat?
前もって機体の中に、風船を仕込んで置くみたいなアイデアはどうかな😂
It didn't blow up
Woooow truely extraordinary

Lots of debris seen floating or flying past in space also?!! 🤔
What material are the hexagonal heat shields made of? And what cohesive is used to stick them together so that it doesn't melt away during the heat of re-entry?
This is all CGI BS.  Same crap NASA tries to feed us.
Terraplanistas, vcs viram a curvatura do nosso planeta?? Oh!! É redondo!!!😂😂😂😂

Getting quite emotional almost just like I left earths atmosphere and am in outer space 🪐
That's beautiful 😻😻
No one could ever convince me that GOD does not exist!!!  this is so freaking beautiful! 😍😍
Employees cheering sounds ridiculous. They sound like children that are surprised by magic.
What are those flaking off?
Spacex is incredible the way they work and the things they do are out of movies we could never imagine that were possible appreciate your work 😊😊
Amazing
Watch a bunch of cgi....just like nasa all fake
Holy shit the Sun really is white in outer space
I wonder , why not wings like the Shuttle ?  Glide to landing rather than being destroyed .
Fools, strange now signal is lost on reentry, never see the heat on the tiles when the rocket 🚀 is going out the atmosphere! Only on reentry🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Cartoon Network 🤡🎪
Does your boardcomputer work well, I would check it 😮 oops 💪🏼 good luck ✌🏼
Elon Musk is the man. MAGA with brilliant guys like this leading the way.
Wild. SpaceX is absolutely amazing. Pushing the envelope.
My signal loss what happen❤
Thank You Elon! I believe you helped bring this! Good for my soul!
What is that debrie flying off? And try not to narrate so much. Other than that, magnifico!
👌👍
Made in a Hollywood Basement
Hi beautiful
Lowest  paid actors.
One name… Elon Musk!
SpaceX should be called Space Explode... Stop killing yourselves!! Stop listening to Elon Muskumbag.. 🤦
what are those tiny objects flying in pieces?
Great thanks to Elon Musk
Cgi, this is all faked for the tards to consume
This totally faked.
Wow
What is all of the flying debris?
we are the Starlink History man ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇳🇪❤🔴🔴🔴🔴🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🌐🌐🌐🌐🌏🌏🌏🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😷😷
Amazing CGI
Too much talking without saying anything !
Geeks geeking out.
Love it,great return!
👍🏻
During re entry , can the ship now able to communicate with earth?
Absolutely breathtaking ❤
Our God the creator of all, will one day come to take us so that where He is there we maybe also.We are going to explore all His creation.
Nice CGIS guys👍👍👍👍
Too many uhs...take speech lessons!❤
What is the small debris that seems to be there
Nothing comes close so far to the might Apollo Program.   Nothing
MUSK

Out of this world
As a youngster I was glued to the TV when men bounced on the moon's surface, but this... THIS is absolutely incredible!
1 km/4 sec = 900 kms/H. Not 26000 kms/H  !  It's fake .
lotta trash flying off....does that stay in orbit???
Funny how we only see this view…it would be just as easy to add another cameras POINTING OUTWARDS
Wow.
Nice A.I. footage to make the fake real!!!
amazing
Why do all nerds sound the same? Lols
How could anyone not like Elon Musk. At least for now.  It Dosint get any better.
Why did Trump praise Elon Musk’s election work in Pennsylvania and his computer vote counting knowledge at his recent rally? Was there tampering with the vote counting computers in Pennsylvania? Governor Should Josh Shapiro investigate German Fascist supporter Musk?
While I really like this year old re-entry, don't you have one from a few days ago?
the 1969 Moon landing deniers will think this is all fake, the mindless creeps!
I no longer support Space X solely due to the evil actions of Musk.
That “splash landing” was titles CGI/AI.
What are the flakes that’s falling?
The hell with Evil Elon.
Yes good but your one more day will come to beat you
Ok
Fake as usual.
Starship is now reentering saaarrr
Space X  will never compare to the the Space Shuttle back in 1980’s it seems where going backwards in the 21 Century  🤔
Jai shri radhey krishna 🙏
😅😂
Why the speed is not dropping during the athm. entering ?
What amazing footage.   This is unprecedented in visual re-entry !    The only distracting part is the incessant jabbering of the commentators and the cheer-leading team in Hawthorne.    They are almost tolerable for lift off but not for minutes at a time when we want to experience this amazing video without pom-poms and leaping boys and girls at a Cheer Camp.    Thank you !!
Loved the video. 🌹🙏🌹
Elon is un loco gringo
Re-entry must be one hell of a ride. Magnificent to watch.😊
What's all that trash flying around the capsule? Is space that nasty now??
Hey nephew ,what are you doing there😂
Damn. I live in there. Something awesome.
Another giant step for mankind.
I'm so geeking out with this😆
So nice and interesting information, thanks a lot !! Congratulations !!
It's okay to stop talking for a few seconds and just watch.
Truly, this footage is absolutely fascinating.   And THIS IS NOT A GRIPE AT ALL…but I do wish that the two (fantastic) commentators could perhaps be placed in a separate room/area in Hawthorne for their broadcast (just so they’re away from flight control/wherever the “crowd” is gathering there), so that when this wonderfully enthusiastic crowd of Space X engineers @ control goes totally bananas during critical maneuvers—especially related to re-entry/landing of the reusable components—we might still be able to hear/understand what our two commentators are saying on the broadcast. I’d have just gotten even more out of the broadcast if their commentary during those critical re-entry stages had been audible. But I of course also enjoy hearing the contagious cheers of all their engineers gathered there in Hawthorne @ control, as they’re CERTAINLY entitled to their boisterous enjoyment of this remarkable, historic event, as this is the best part of the “payoff” for all their hard work.   I continue to celebrate along with them—from this first, ground-breaking event last year through all the exciting developments ongoing now, in Spring 2025!
Amazing guys thanks to technology
Magnificent. Especially hearing the joy in the voices of the people who made it a success.
Trump & Elon Musk r really great in getting back the  astronauts back to earth
Only stupid people believe such hoax.....
Only fake show
Great footage ! Thank you team Elon and SpaceX 🎉🎉🎉
Great USA Great Tesla❤

Where did they go?
The Earth is flat, some people say.
I have reason to believe that the cheering in the audio track is fake.
I dont get all of this cheering .
Were so fortunate to see the technology with today's Space related flights, vehicles, and camera angles. The Mars Rovers, the arms catching the the booster rockets, etc.  Just so much fun!
Shiva has something different , cool name
Trash video I thought they were gonna show the complete reentry
Fake
What is the sound from within the can I say it the vehicle?
Absolutely awesome
This is the EMPTY Starship re-entry without astronauts you have posted. Read and be educated . <<<That's Boeing. he Dragon spacecraft SpaceX Crew-10 launches aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft piloted by astronaut and Air Force Maj.
Hello Genius poster. Starship is Boeing, Space X is Dragon. You are just without real knowledge posting for pay. Your site is BS, very incorrect info. Get your sh*t together.  SpaceX Crew-10 launches aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft piloted by astronaut and Air Force Maj.
I'm unimpressed. In the 80s there were space shuttle ships flying in and out of space.... now everyone is excited about rockets that can only go vertical 40 years later?
Experiments are expensive but necessary!
Shibu....u mean shibu...malayali guy ... everywhere 😂
Cancel Elon's contract!!!!!!
Very nicely explained
Everybody SHUTUP!!!
but how about those trash that are left in the space?
So many pieces flying around orbit my god fabulous watching it in slow motion looks like it wonderful realistic view of from space entering into earth !
Am i supposed to believe that NASA has genuine pics of Jupiter which according to the criminals that run Google amd YT, is only 760,000,000 ks away?(LOL)
Good image's
Does the rocket care that people are clapping? Why are they cheering and clapping? Do they have no confidence in what they've created? The last few minutes look to me like TV shopping, buy 3 get 2!
Speed indicated 26,000 km/h yet took 6 seconds to travel one  ķìlometer ?? WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSHIT this is !!😊
Notice she never said flat earth u bunch of clowns
What is all the debris coming from it pls?
26000 km / h wow
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE
Thank you Elon Musk, SpaceX, Nasa and president Trump
I never comment in YouTube but this one I have to this is just incredible
Can anyone explain the "Speed" and the "Altitude" being shown in the bottom right corner? If this is a vertical decent and star ship is flying at such a high speed, shouldn't it be able to cover those 8-90 kms in like 10-12 seconds?
I wish I paid more attention in science class. Why does it look like it’s moving so slow?
Great work by SpaceX. Musk company has definitely achieved a tough milestone. I still don't understand, why the great NASA could not bring them back without SpaceX?
🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
We can truly see it.
it never went beyond the firmament
The title says 2024 ?
What's with all the cheering?
Watching this in 2025 gives me a nostalgic sense of when Elon wasn't involved in politics and was instead the cool rocket guy.
Thanks from France...
A bunch of kids in tee-shirts and ball caps thinking this is the first time this has been done. Oooh look ceramic heat shields!!! This is not new and it's not a big accomplishment. Maybe for dumb kids who never paid attention to history. We use to have this thing called NASA been here done that
Musk has ruined this kind of thing fir me. 😒
mantaaap
SCOTTY SCOTTY
If anyone believes this is real, I have some lakefront property in Arizona for sale!! This is all simulation, the firmament is impenetrable, we've never been to space, and NASA stands for Not A Space Association. The ship will only skim the surface of the firmament, we live on a stationary flat planet and we are not going anywhere. Stop believing this garbage. Just because this is what they've beat it in your head your whole life, don't make it true.  Do your research, find out when "round earth" comes about, the education system was put into place to make us working bees, nothing more, nothing less. Stop allowing these ppl to control you and look inside yourself, open your mind and search for the truth. Don't bother responding, I won't see it. And you're welcome.
are those heat shields something new? I mean, space shuttle got it since the 70s or what? But I was here for the re-entering view :D
All laws of physics being applied
I just saw the physics in practice
People today who believe this are tv watching zombies.
Fake  flaps can’t operate at that speed it would be over a million ftlbs of torque to operate.. this is bad 90’s movie
SO SPAce is a cartoon.
Question: Does Starlink have to deal with the heating reentering the atmosphere?
These people are in a cult
Amazing that Elon Musk could accomplish all this with ,  as per AOC,  he is the least intelligent person she knows.    She must hang out with aliens....unfortunately all of them are illegal.
So salut like you would with your favorite fuhrer
Oooooh.... Im soo moved i could crush a grape big boy...

It may be that the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) would have survived if NASA had NOT wasted $4,500,000,000 on the traitor and illegal immigrant con man, Elon Musk.
CGI bullshit!
Nice of order
My cell phone😂😂🎉❤
Broadcast  one of the first. Critical. But nice. Having  no.sucsellfuell
strange... balloons with gopro go much higher and the plasma doesn't appear.
could they have got someone with a more effeminate vioce? Nauseating.
the fact y’all so dumb just flip the sky around😂😂😂or upside down they never be over an planet just always water
That speed doesn't make sense. 26000km/h but cant cover an alititude of 100km in less than 10mins?? Somebody make it make make sense to me
Her being so into this make her so much sexier lol a beautiful woman talking science about Starship 😍😍😍😍
Beautifully remained under the dome all the time filming with fish eye lens as usual. It gets even more primitive with all these pathetic screamings from the staff public behind. No HUMAN has ever crossed that "Twillight Zone" which is the dome and never went to the so called Space. What you see there in the outside, this black ether is another dimension. (as Rod Serking once said :-)  My explanation is not scientific at all, don't bother remind me of that, it is simply REALISTIC.
As a flat-earther I can totally explain how they faked this…  JUST KIDDING!! Massive well done to the SpaceX team this is truly incredible footage it’s a double whammy for me because the plasma visuals were amazing and I always get emotional every time I see our earth with that dark endless void behind it and all the amazing things out there in space ❤ I’m excited for the future of space travel.
You got to hand it to them. SpaceX want to do a lot of the things we were dreaming of as kids
Why are they showing starship, just show this anchor she is more beautiful than the atmosphere view😊😊
Space x hides flat doomed earth 🤣🤣
Elon is the most important person of our time.
Elon u cn make more money from other sources,
Does anyone else find it stupid the way they cheer every 5 seconds
most spaceships: burns up in the atmosphere  the mounted camera:
After watching this, I wonder how Portholes works?
what an insane way to throw your $$$$$$ away.     do some good, would ya.

where is the firmament?
So now we understand why it cost US 3 dollars to go to work!
They still cant put a man on the moon!!
Y'all are true Americans!  What a GREAT VIDEO!

Extremely interesting and impressive (except for the idiots yelling in the background)
Never left the lower atmosphere fact
What happened to the ionospheric hole No One talks about it!!!
Are the flames from burning a hole in the O zone ?
Elon Musk belongs to us now!  MAGA is so lucky this genius is part of the Trump administration in charge of lowering the deficit!  He said he could get 2 trillion off!  America is lucky to have the team Trump/Musk/Vance/RFK Jr!!!! 🇺🇸
Can anyone tell me anything about the two stuck on the international space station? How did they go with the latest mass coronial expulsion.?
3:00 That shot of the sun sitting in the dark void of space, providing the glossy look on earth is sweeeet
why so much annunciation on the S's?.....its annoying listening to dudes talk that way.....its like they're way of letting everyone know they love the D
Space x is not a starship it's a hunk of jung!
What ceramic material is used for shield ?
Elon Musk is one smart cookie 🍪!!😆👍🇺🇸
I can’t imagine it traveling at 26K mph!!!
On you title picture you show satellites being deployed but nothing of the sort in the video.  The reason I viewed.  We've all seen the launch and landings.
What I'm unclear about is the ability for the booster to withstand the heat of reentry, given the blunt end is forward and traveling at supersonic speed.
Thank You Elon!
This is what I'm talking about Elon Musk has got it going on Space X Tesla is the bomb. One day we'll be able to do this like going for Dallas to Washington DC. It's unbelievable.
CGI
WHY, do Americans always have this incessant need to Shout, Holla, Yell, Scream? Its not just exuberance, it's primal!
MAGA!!!
A FlatEarther blocked this Channel
This is a great achievement but consider a civilization that may be like 2000 years in advance of us as tech goes ( yes aliens)how do you view an old assembly line of model "T" thats prob what " they" are looking at....
0:37 Look right along the edges of the airframe. Especially around the wings.   Does that look like thermal air distortion? From superheated Air that isn't quite hot enough to be a plasma?   Or is the camera playing tricks on my eyes?
Please don't find another planet to inhabit and ruin!
Thunderbirds are go. Did anyone check on the speed the craft had and the distance to earth?
Are those little particles passing by the camera space debris?
What is that flying by on the right side of the screen at 1:14 from bottom to top of the screen?
So you telling me it left the Firmament?…… 🤔
Yeah dead real. 😂
lol, how many people think this is real.  You can clearly see the soft-looking cgi.  I do better things in Blender.
Waoooooo.😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
next time please do this on day light we cannot see it landing on the water
All CGI! What a crap!
This is the most faked video i ever watched. What are we looking at? Even NASA cgi shit is better.
Stupidest
Elon you Donald trump With God can do Great things for the world 🌎 God bless youse and protect youse and your families from the evil one Amen 👊
Flatearthers:  "This doesn't prove anything"  🤦‍♂
I like how the spaceship is *clearly* completely out of control, entering ass-first, flipping around, spinning wildly, and nobody mentions it, they all act like it's totally normal.
Beautiful
rather you like him or not, elon is doing some cool shit
25707 km/h at 65 km altitude, that's not very high up going that speed, falling speed from gravity is 120 mh?
E dov'è l'atterraggio??
Puts into perspective how there was no hope for Columbia on reentry.
I just watched the very awesome 2 part documentary about The Apollo 17 mission to the moon. It was interesting listening to the commentators, the flight controllers and astronauts. None of them women or gays. Why do we have a woman and a gay narrating this? Why not some serious men?
Fake
Nerd clapping, the best!😅
Then fall into and sink in the Indian Ocean!!! Fucking SubmarineX!!!
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
00:28  Mom i see the star
6:24  if i get a nickel every time she mentions the atmosphere slowing the ship down id be a millionaire
i cant believe people still fall for this fakery lol people are stupid and so gullible
Well i think planet Mars atmospheric entry will be much hellish to penetrate. But i love this development
Sooooooò The earth is round👍
Big deal?? Fifty years ago we went to the Moon and back and took a moon buggy to drive around in. Now you think its great that a rocket can come back from Low Earth Orbit. Are you people dumb or what? What have you been doing for fifty years? Reinventing the wheel??????
The first two narrators sound like young teenaged boys.
Where is all the ppl calling space fake At?! And the people that says we don't actually have a space station?! 😂😂😂😂😂 Clowns 🤡
Why with all the technology does the audio from these space flights always sound like it's being played through an aluminum can?
Ma cosa fanno il tifo come allo stadio?!
Wow what a great video  thanks
i'm very happy for successfull projects. Wishing all the best for future endeavours.
What a nice CGI video folks 😅
Those people are just too loud
Yeah and the signal always goes out at the most revealing and important point....
What’s all the debris flashing past??
Did they bring back the two stranded? This is what we should care about. Or,  they went up there to have a party?
It looks completely different and wrong, what a idiotic camera viewpoint, made for children.
Looks fake sorry😂
Are the astronauts in this rocket coming back to earth
So this ship is moving at mach 26, and you see pieces coming off flying in all directions but no plasma field forming around them.   @ 3:58 watch that little chunk flow past the fin and it just mozies off the screen.
Nice green screen 😂
Listen to the excitement of these employees! I don’t think I ever heard that with government employees at NASA
I ve been watching this..and can't see even one commercial Aircrafts in the visual in vast view... Really strange.. evenafter we have soo much traffic in air
And part of what you are also seeing is an obstructed view of earth. I also observed a flat straight across horizon no "curvature". Absolutely no curvature. Why is it that any view that could silent flat earthers or prove we've been lied to about something else, just doesn't exist as a live shot or true photo. But replay. If you didn't see it. No curvature
i watch these videos on mute with the Captions on. one of the most annoying things about Space x missions is the hype crowd in the background.
Why is everyone cheering at random points??  Or am I missing some internal events going on? I tend to be on the side of holding it all in until touchdown.
I wonder, how the tiles attach. And the birth of the plasma field was astonishing.
But they did that alreadywwhen they went to the moon and back. Or am I missing something? D:
“They will climb to the Heavens”
"Currently Re Entering?" Where's the landing? All the "Applause" and sounds like game show "Applause" just wondering what we saw? Some object, started glowing red (Game show applause)....and then a sales pitch at the end, as if you were watching a NASCAR race? Lol...Show the landing and recovery.
Not “furthest!” FARTHEST is correct!
Beautiful Flat Earth.. Glad that's sorted.
0.55 did anybody see that face ?  That plasma trai was stunning
I may have missed this in the commentary, but what is all the debris you see flying around?  Is this the space trash that everyone talks about that is apparently a real and increasing problem?
Silly question:  Speed: 26594 km/hr Altitude: 128 km  Why it took so long to come down?😐😐
Note to the commentators.  STFU when something is amazing.  Good lord. 😂
it must be real because it looks so fake? the cheering is silly hollywood crap. they need it to sell to you something big is happening when its just a foogazi
Elon Musk and his team are absolutely amazing at what they turn their hand to. 🇮🇪
Wait.l thought the earth was flat,there is no outer space,space is full of water,and lm still looking for the ice wall.was l lied to?
Many years Nasa couldnt be this transparent with their Video?
Very cool.
Amen
"...he's attempting re-entry sir"
His voice is higher-pitched than hers.
So much junk and heat tiles getting thrown off . Pollution of our atmosphere is outstanding  .
Thank you from the human's on earth and most of all, South Africa
Thought we had an UAP there at 1:44, but it was only debris..., [fail horn]
FAKE
Nothing much new here. It was all done before by NASA in 1969. Musk and his planet-destroying toys. Billionaires are your enemy.
So many debris in space?
_If there was vacuum involving the atmosphere without any “skin” or walls to maintain the gases inside, there would be no atmosphere._
Anybody calculated the speed with times,  How it is slow landing  26600 in hour 443km in minutes  7 km in second should be comes
Pathetic humans destroying everything for$$$$
So clean all that garbage falling in the atmosphere?
Sure looks like wood grain on those heat shields when she tilts it toward the camera at timecode 7:25
Great CGI
Hahaha, Fucking NASA Scamer to spending bilion of taxpayer money with this wideogame. Wake up American people.
Is it called St elmos fire
Biggest bllsht since the moon crap!
NOMKUSIC
The Earth is not flat isn't it?
Sick!
Waw
why ppl yelling behind?
What are those pieces flying off?
I don't see any flat-earthers in the comments
I always let out a bit of plasma before re entry
These people are easily impressed by the flaps moving. 😊
Pakistani transvestite , nice voice😂
Agh I can remember doing this on my bicycle 😂
But this was accomplished decades ago wasn't it?? 😂😂😂
Can't they shut up for a minute during re-entry???
Poor quality CGI.   Fake X.
this is just a computer simulation.
I wonder how many plastic models they melted to make this video
Thanx Elon !!! 👍💥🔥💪🤗
Video is even better on Mute
Earth Is Flat ❤
Gee does it look like the earth is flat?😂😂😂
How flat earthers argue with this
Abdolutamente fantástico! ❤❤❤❤❤
not that impressive. Space shuttle was the deal. We are tired of this. Come down help earth.
🥱 Once again using a camera lense that distorts the image of earth. Of course this could be settled in an instant if we could actually send something up high enough with a camera looking down towards earth, one continuous, unedited live shot
can someone explain why the rate of descent was not about 7 kms per second wich it should be when moving at 26600 kmph ?
Filmed stuck in place   Great cgi though
Fake
ELON MUSK AND HIS MERRY BAND OF NERDS ENGINEERS AREC1000 TIMES SMARTER THAN ALL OF THE UNITED STATES AND NASA EMPLOYEES, IF NASA EVER GETS HUMANS TO THE MOON YOU CAN BET ELON IS DOING ALL THE BRAIN WORK AND HEAVY LIFTING. NASA IS USED UP OLD SCHOOL TECK, ELON IS THE ZHiT!
Most expressive thing this old man has ever seen ❤️🇺🇸
Nerdgasm
Awesome video.... but what was all the debris coming off the ship ?😳 Would have been nice if the narrators had mentioned something about it 🙃
As a kid who watched the moon landing live I think this is unfreakingbelievable!  Steely eyed missilemen the whole lot of ya'!!  WELL DONE!!!
Oh, look the starlink is giving the crazy flat eathers a run for their money. Or are they going to tell you that starlink is a hoax? 🤣
Stupid audience noise
Who are these cults cheering. Its actually scary hearing how programmed to hysteria these people are. They are obviously paid to be hysterical for the great leader God oh sorry Elon.
Do you still wait 40k after 5th wave 58.5k ?
Can someone send this video to the idiotic flat earth believers!
painfull to listen too with all shouting in background, very unprofessional broadcast
The amount of ignorants is incredible!
Absolutely incredible!!!
Weird that you have to spend all that money and time to do this, and all I have to do is go to sleep to go places :)
Whole place is having an orgasm. Lmao
So FN Cool. Thanks Musk!
Wow… I believe this really happened and I can’t wait for Santa Claus to come to my house down the chimney on Christmas.
The male commentator sounds like Google CEO, sundar pitchai😁
You gotta love Elon Musk.
what a fake...
Good luck🍀🚀
Noel is on the mountain building his ship. Life on earth must be preserved, but first destroyed. This time it will be fire from molecules of mass. Life must return to binary, condensed and flown away for 40 000 years. We will figure this out. It has been done before.
Speaking for everyone that lived through the Apollo programme......Get over yourselves.
where are all the flat earthers saying the eath is not round?
The only way to interpret this failure is it was a failure and the next one will be a failure and the next one will be a failure because it's just a terribly design space vehicle. What good is it going to be? Give me a reason for this thing to even exist if we're gonna take it to the moon, you're gonna have to refuel it flights for this are estimated app 12 to 22 times we're not going to Mars either that's an Elon musk wet dream also again there's no reason to go to Mars not just the physiology of human beings but the cost and what will get from it if there was 1000 people on Mars right now today with everything they needed for the next 50 years, they would all be dead within the next 15 from physiological related illnesses and diseases can you imagine the number of actions that will happen during refueling and 12 to 22 attempts so we can go to the moon for what this entire program was based on one man's ego stick with falcon at least it has a reason to exist like clogging up LEO with communication satellites, so Elon can have some more money Sierra space is the company worth watching at least they can put another large habitat in space for continued research on low gravity science
Fake
Who are these two women speaking?
Highspeed data? This makes it very hard to believe that a spaceship made it to the moon in the 60s, and talked back to earth, way before cell phones. Riddle me this please.
The flat earthers must be doing their nuts😂
no landing at the end 😢
what a clown show. give them a flying piece of crap, a fisheye lense, some screaming and applauding in the background and they believe even the dumbest narration.
Aliens: Ooo plasma, I'll take that YOINK
Fake Show.
02:20min bubbles.. 🙊🙈🙉
What a fake show 🤡

Gay lisp commentary  is terrible
I've seen cameras mounted on rock separating hoppers more stable than that.
❤❤❤
ALLAH IS ALMIGHTY.
Wow spectacular view
This is incredible 🎉😮
So fake 😂😂😂😂😂
Quindi a 127 km niente curvatura terreste 😂😂
Did anyone notice those objects zoom past just before re entry?!!
2 septembre 2024
vu ce matin é septembre 2024 au dessus de la baie de somme
Big deal! We have been hanging around low earth orbit for half a century! When are we going to land on the damn moon?!? We have a space station now right? Should be much easier to leapfrog back and forth no?!?
I'm in love with her voice.🥰🤪😜
God's creation is amazing! Atmosphere, earth, stars, moon, sun, gravity's WOW!
How are the tiles attached? it looks like you can see tiles floating away during re-entry. At some point loss of tiles could be a serious thermal management concern.
My phone showed a black screen the entire time so I had to give it a thumbs down😊
It’s Sci-Fi NO MORE.
the earth is clearly flat. you can see it. grow up and do your own research THEY are LYING to you. Elon 4ever xoxoxoxox
Amazing great job
can't you go through the flat Earth dome? Next time don't use a wide-angle lens that way everybody can see the flat Earth. If you're that high the star should be blinding you. Where are they where is all the Stars the Milky Way all that?
Where are the stars shouldn't they be blinding? Why a wide angle lens? Flat Earth. The stars are a hologram. Why is it dark in space it should be blinding you
I miss the days when there was NOT the sophomoric celebrations throughout each stage of things compared to Apollow et al.  And I lost count but starship, starlink, starship starlink I mean how many times ..... we get it we get it we get it
Why i left Christianity  https://youtu.be/I_btCVYm1IA?si=QGcon4vNi3omCTUV  And  https://youtu.be/SdyyNimjYCs?si=vFbcuRhXeHww9yEf
How did the camera survive the temperatures of the re-entry? Those temperatures will melt glass/camera lenses!
Why was the link not brought back after reentry? Did the system malfunction?
is it a requirement to be gay in today's professional workforce. because this voice is annoying
6:06 that's fast?
Too much noise
--------------------------the debris
CGI. Nicely done and so believable. Bravo.
That was incredible!! Seeing the whole earth from space is so beautiful.💕
What about the landing 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Ohhhh wait, the Earth is not flat .
2:54  Wow, the sun really is white!!
And the camera never melted 😂😂😂
Heat shields should have been X’s

2:49 Wow! Finally, you can see stars in the space of a video out of nowhere, and that's because the Earth has darkened, taking away all the brightness, and once again it is reaffirmed that the sun is white and not yellow.
Hindus shd prominently write their names on their shop board. Let muslim not write.
Anticlimactic.

Just incredible to see.
Ufos do it better
Amazing! That is why I love astronomy and everything related to space. And love SpaceX. I would like to work for SpaceX.
Whose talking he sounds gay
What an annoying accent !
كذابين ونصابين 😂😂😂 باقي مستمرين بالكذب على الناس
"hmm let's watch this interesting video" * screams from hell in the first second *
Not even the best green screen production 👹 very disappointing you couldn’t make it at least look real. I can’t get over the amount of sheep you still have 🤔💭 unless those are all bot comments
Why is the vehicle spinning?
There you go, flat earthers. A nice round blue planet. No firmament or secret hole for reentry. No pillars holding the planet up.😂 fucking goons.
WOW!!
So theyre re entering at crazy speeds eh cool. Whats the stuff just calmly floating around the ship then ? 4:00
Elon hungry to sell VR
If only it landed on elons head.
Wow  incredible 😮 ,
Is that heat blurr by the tail or Photoshop?
It’s impossible to go through the firmament of the earth.
No pocket protectors were harmed in the filming of this video.
If the ship heated like this….the structural integrity is compromised. An engineer would never let it be used again. A simple weld would be compromising. This is basic. Basic knowledge anyone can check.  While welding is an essential technique, it can be prone to certain defects that may compromise structural integrity. It is crucial to identify and address these defects to ensure the longevity and safety of the structure.-Boom&Bucket
Amazing how steal immediately turns red hot but the camera? Oh just fine. What 🐂💩.🤢🤮
Being able to see this footage is absolutely AMAZING. I can't even begin to imagine how beautiful space is in person. 😍
I can't believe people believe in this deception thinking this is real while this is just a PS game clip
Incredible work.
What kind of shielding does the camera have?
Sorry flat-earthers, the Earth is spherical and not flat (starting at 2:34).
Poor Sheeple. So desperate for entertainment that you actually be.LIE.ve this trash. 3.7 Million of you.
show me video of it leaving the ground all the way through the air and into the black space to the moon or very far away where i can see the entire earth once they show a full non stop video of that without any cutting out or turning on and off then i will believe they can go to space. i dont believe they can go to space thats why they show you video in the air and not in space first then entering the atmosphere thats because they cant leave the earth its all fake they are lying to us
No one can get out firmament
🟡☀ 🌻 I found asbestos tiles' that insulated North America' Ontario, Alberta homes. I also found My torch set I used to cut 1 3/4" plate steel. So before I reused them, they got tested with the torch set. I left the blue flame on to glow orange red yellow until the pressure valve said empty. . . they look new ... and the sliding garage doors look zombie like too ... . .. The Upper Canada One Arm  KJV* Amen
is this real or Ai?
Man! Get this fake stuff out of here!!!!!!
Hard to listen to that guy.  Make men men again, please.
Ok now invent a mass relay like in the mass effect video games...so that space x can travel to mars and other planets in just minutes...😊😅
The gayguy blew out my tweeters with his lisp.
I would add 2 more degrees of angle to dissipate the kinetic energy more efficiently between the flaps and the axels.
¿Porque es tan violento el reingreso a la tierra?  Gracias   BCN
Hey go easy on NASA.....losing all that data from Apollo in 1969---1972 took some real effort....
Elon should be a very proud man. He is a genius and I’m so thankful he has made the US his home. I feel he is only just starting his magic.
Fantastic
So................who do you think will take the regionals this year?
What time of day was this and where?
This particular Starship was actually lost, and was not expected to return.
Horrendous waste of tax payer dollars in an attempt to reuse old technologies and present them as new to uninformed investors.
_Hey, what happened to the Earth? I thought it was flat_ 🤔😅
3:06 Where the flat Earthers at?
Watch on mute and it’s better
I kept gagging. "FLAPS!" Stabilizers? Sure! Fins? Okay. FLAPS!? Kiss my ass! Also fire whoever hired the super-nasal commentator!
I like this❤
but nasa always said this had to be a blackout period. Go spaceX. stay away from nasa.
We've seen this a thousand times before, kids.  During the space race in the 50s and 60s.
Am I hearing people cheering?? Who?
Overreaction because Musk is sitting there.  Meh.
Reminds me of the 2003 Columbia Space Shuttle disaster. Nasa knew the shuttle wouldn't survive re-entry after the impact that occurred from the launch. It must have been tough talking with the crew while they were up there knowing they didn't have long left to live. The crew had no idea what was going to happen during re-entry.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the private sector.
SO MANY PEOPLE WATCHING THINKING ITS REAL HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CGI,fake news
Why is everyone so hyped about this? Has no one watched Star Trek or Star Wars?
nice renders
What is it with Americans and screaming at every goddamned opportunity. Shut the hell up so I can listen to the commentary!
Done for a fraction of the price of NASA
good sci-fi
Absolutely incredible!
A private company. Doing at a profit what NASA does while NASA charges the taxpayer billions each year. Anyone see the lesson here?
People couldn't be more asleep,  if they tried.  Wow.
We now know the trunk of this spacecraft landed in North Carolina
Fake
It's definitely a product of artificial intelligence, definitely. I'm telling you, flat earthers. And the camera can withstand entry into the atmosphere....They glued a disc to cut metal and consider themselves engineers....
Incredible ❤. Btw what are those pieces just falling out?
Just had a great sandwich.
It’a like watching grass grow. Nothing high tech here, use anti-gravity for slow decent. Or nuke power.
Awesome !!!
Dweebs
NAZI .......SPACE SHIP
This is Buck Rodgers technology.
What a bunch of nerds, relax, weirdo’s
Why don't you just shut up they love hearing themselves talk and let us watch it
Air involvement create plasma...
20+yrs aerospace enginering, is that Chris Patt in the green cap @6:32?
so much better on mute.
What is flying off this thing, you can see lots of debris
Recreating what was already done in the 1960s.  Not as impressive as I had hoped.
So cool
This is NOT space!
At 3:24 of this video the commentator mentions that Starship is "beginning to enter the Earth's atmosphere." But how is this possible if Earth's atmosphere extends beyond the moon? Wouldn't it already be in Earth's atmosphere at 100KM if the Moon is 38,000 miles away from the earth and the atmosphere extends beyond it? Or is that article about the atmosphere extending beyond the moon false?
Thank you to the tax payers for helping fund all of musk's companies
The crowd sheep noise is hilarious... Lol.
So fake...Liars and frauds...Just like the politician...SHAME ON YOU ALL...USAF VETERAN...Space X is Fake X...I guess the matt damon mars movie is true...They at least have 10X's better CGI..
live video at 22x the speed of sound... phenomenal
cheers to all you blind blievers
I thought colors indicate temps. Hows it skip cool and go to hot? My gpa made that paint btw. The white high heat paint? My gpa worked under Nasa.

Where are the flat earthers?
Could do without the screaming and yelling , very distracting.
So fake. Like the 50’s snd 60’s all over again.
Rocket Ship: “My biscuits are burning!”
These hyper-excited people who scream like children who have had too much coffee. This lack of politeness and restraint is unbearable!
On a planet where 25,000 children and babies under the age of 5 years die every day these delusionists want to go into space.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And that view of a curved earth made every flerfs head explode.  Great video.
Speed shown is some nonsens......  7,6 km/s look really different
Better to help any African nation so that it can stand on their feet and prosper.
Advancing spaceflight and science - and they still use 'Fahrenheit'; let's not have a repeat of the Mars Climate Orbiter.
speed 26000/h altitude 150km it still took 8 min to reach earth surface???
WOW,,, now I am proud of my last name KARMAN..
If aliens saw this they would be pissing themselves
Wow! I can see the curve of the Earth!!  LOL  Even if this was real, it's hardly a Starship.
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Lol hilarious, and still the sleep walkers eat this shite up!  NASA ☠️, check out the origin of this institution shee'ple 🤔

Watching from earth via Starlink
who said the earth is flat?! well, they've got to watch this. Congrats Space-X
How's it feel, Flat Earthers?
Space is fake, NASA has the largest film studio in the WORLD. some astronauts said "there is pitch black in space", some astronauts say "there's stars as far as you can see". Buzz Aldrin got heated when asked about this and threatened the interviewing crew.
Space Shuttle Columbia does not approve this video
Any of you stupid flat earthers watching this!!!...
What a load of bullsh**t! 2600 degrees!? How the hell is that camera not melted almost instantly? Also, the atmosphere supposedly slowing it down...? Am i the only one watching the speedometer posted on the bottom right side showing that it is NOT slowing down! The cheering and screaming is so stupid! Why the hell would anyone care to hear people in the background of a video being fake cheerleaders? Morons!
"Clap or you're fired!"
Blah blah blah ...Flat Earth
Dorks.
Awesome CGI.. 🤣
Thank you for providing this footage!
Watching the amazing views of earth, and that plasma shield form with starlinks continuing to transmit is just awe inspiring.
Fake !!!
seeing the top of the clouds feel Illegal
Wow I love seeing how badly SpaceX is failing
What with all the debris?
…non si vede  neanche una stella…. una buffonata
Amazing 🎉thanks
wow
Awesome 👌
Awesome footage, who can tell me what are those stuffs/flakes falling off in the beginning of the clip? interesting to know. thanks!
_The only truth is “these _*_INCREDIBLE_*_ views. The rest is FAKE._
There used to be blind communication spots, not anymore I guess. Private entrepreneurs entering this field is a game changer for humanity as a whole.
Rewatching this again and the fact that space x was able to capture these images and views on top of their incredible successes in the leaps and bounds of space exploration technology is truly extraordinary! What a spectacular achievement
Re enter earths atmosphere   ,,,,    boring     ,, mars  by the year  4987   by the looks of things  ...
What am i seeing fly by the ship?!
Some of the Hollywood movies are able to picture the exact way the  space craft reentry  in to the atmosphere.
Don't watch this shittt video
Oh how the Pi is taken .   Cheering at 22.7
Fake. CGI...
Whatever happened to professionalism in the control room? Is the laughing really necessary? Sounds like a fraternity party.
It fails and let it burn up, I guess they can try 100 times and it will still burn up. Unvalidated engineering.
Hats off to the team!!!  A few days ago, I was talking to a young, recently graduated aerospace engineer who was looking for a job.  I asked if he had tried applying to SpaceX. He replied, "No, I heard it's a tough place to work." I told him, "You should form your own opinion by trying it yourself. If you don't like it, you can always leave, but at least you'd have experience from a respected company on your resume. Have you considered that maybe the people who complained about SpaceX were fired because they did everything except work?" His response was silence... and he's still unemployed. Hard life? Hard work? Ask your grandparents how tough life was; their stories might help you see things differently....  Again congratulations to the smart and hardworking team! If it was easy, NASA would have accomplished it, despite the astronomical amount of taxpayer money they received.
It "really happened". :)
CGI live 😂
4:33 speeds at re-entry here are around 26,755 km/hr so that's around Mach 21.6 or 21.6 times the speed of sound. During atmospheric re-entry, temperatures soar to over 1,400 degrees Celsius...At times, the hottest parts of the tiles with stood heat shield thermal testing temperatures of 1,377 degrees Celsius — that's a whopping 2,510 degrees Fahrenheit!
Great re entry ?👌

Why is that woman so concerned with her attractiveness? Is there no job that women can look like just people?
Yea yea, the plasma field I get it.....who's the cute space babe?
The  woman giving the talk is hot and smart . That is tops.
Totally off topic but what is his accent ?
This would be sooooo cool if it was real.
Have a nice day my dear friends. I greet you. You are wonderful people.

What are all the little fragments between 2 to 3 minutes? Looks like big snowflakes but i doubt they are
It’s great to look down on the Earth from the camera
They just keep cheering at nothing 😂😂
You're kidding right ?  In the movies......

Still .... Not one fucking video of actual space ..... NASA, Space-X .... "Space Agencies" that love to show us nothing but FUCKING EARTH???? Wake the fuck up people!!!
People in America freaking out.  Well, those in touch with reality.  Not many.  The rest of the planet. Basically none.😅
It's a shame the crowd makes so much noise so we can't here the commentary! Can't you yanks keep quite for a while?
So glad went fab,❤nicola marshall
What is with all the debries flowing around
So the Billionaire class spends US taxpayers money playing around in space, while we have utter chaos on Earth. Btw, for those of you who still don’t know, Musk has contracts w the U.S. Military to weaponize space. But of course, many of you are too busy cheerleading his dog and pony show.  Wishing Elon Musk would actually build things that working class people can afford is not his priority, folks.   P.S. Tesla’s are junk, and his parents got wealthy off the backs of children mining gems in South Africa.
This would be better if his voice wasn’t like that
God is real
How can you not be impressed with watching that - so cool
Are there any heterosexual men, here? Or, do you all want Elon…lololol…this is absolutely a bunch of rubbish. I do not believe a word of it, lololol.
Why is it not stabilized before reentry.?? Spinning around. Is this just purely luck that it didn't burn to atmosphere??
What is that small pieces falling
How can anyone hate Elon Muusk for givinng us hope for the future? He will no doubt nail it next test. 20 bucks on the table!
Awesome News!!  Heat Shields are very Important. Used to watch the Shuttle Launches in Florida live or on TV back home!!  Miss being able to!!
Well, I'll be damned. They really got this ridiculous thing into space. I've been a doubter since they announced the thing but I guess I'll eat my words about starship.
Human ingenuity is amazing.
Watch at the 3:57 mark in the video and I swear I see a White object flying up from the ground at High Speed past vehicle!
Was I the only one that saw the face it starts right after 1:10 however you hold your phone it's top right area in the cloud and it's a demon face not sure what it might be just look real close you will see it

Thats so cool you guys. Thanks for showing the videos
MEANWHILE....New York can't keep the garbage picked up....GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM...
16k mph entry wow that's incredible
Its gone
Starting to melt
This rocket ship fell out of orbit and burned up in re-entry
one thing i dont understand is the relationship between the speed and altitude. travelling that fast but the ship taking 0.25 a minute to cover one kilometer? someone school me. that speed you got to eat up a kilometer in 3 seconds or so
It is reentering in pieces and ash. It looked like a fish out of water. Good God.
Stop cheering! It burnt up! The bar is really set low on this tin can.
Why are they cheering? It is out of control!
It looks amazing. Im glad this real
4:46 Looks like an album cover
Coming in Hot! Sheesh!
So fake it looks real !
All those dumbasses talking about heaven filliment or something seem to have shut up!
Lol, fake
Incredible
semes fake
And people still believe this is real lol, omg wake up people your being laughed at.
dang! thumbs up to the camera man! imagine the heat!
We see heat at 100km of altitude?!?🤔 ,  it is saying there is no air molecule up there, why heat is generated? What is spaceship facing with? Facing with Earth atmosphere? When there is no air molecules, what can cause heat to spaceship?
Plasma
Hilarious
People believe anything hahaha
THUMBS DOWN!!  CLICKBAIT...Didnt show the whole process   Im discouraged and let down....
Amazing. Thank you for sharing this!

SpaceX once again proving the Nay Sayers wrong,  Go SpaceX, Go Elon and Go Tesla     And everyone with Tesla shares vote Elon his bonus Package its not right he has worked 6 years without pay.
Whittle and Von Braun would be impressed.
why not use a heat resistan, flexible, lightly ancored, self heat ablading fabric wrap around  the earth exposed half of the main part of the ships hull that can be quiclky inspected and or replaced after every re-entry?
The guy sounds gay AF
Elon Musk congratulation what you have accomplished  is amazing
Why they so excited for?
Just watching this makes me disey why ?
Why hexagonal shaped tiles ?
Wow, out of control space x so called starship.
Awesome video!!!  What makes it so good is the Nerds losing it in the background.
Thank you for the incredible views.  There is a smarter way to re-enter Earth atmosphere without using heat shield. Just ionise atmosphere by laser or electric field and use magnetic field to redirect ionised particles as you need.
The Informational educators Subscribe & Share this YouTube channel🎉🎉
flat earth theory??? 😂
Marvellous accomplishment.
Not enough  credit goes to the people who build the engines and the rocket everybody thinks its elon well its not
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ummmm ok
You can see it`s tumbling and the heat shield tiling coming off.Well, it`s only a second flight out of the atmosphere and not enough attitude control, the tiles flying off is a little disconcerting.
Waiting for a stupid Flat Earth comment.  LOL   This is Amazing.   Go Science!!
Wow! Watch Pedo Guy's shitty rocket blow up, again.
One day we might actually see at least ONE of the almost 10,000 satellites that are supposedly orbiting earth..
I wonder how the camera is still alive when the vehicle is melting down
Earth is absoluetly beautiful.
What a load of old COCK!
18,000 MPH
Why does it look as though it's leaving Earth?
I'm pretty sure Starlink has just proven to be the most powerful and reliable ISP on the planet.
Can you get a campier sounding guy next time? Thanks in advance.
So incredible to see a Starship in space
you know it's fake coz it looks so real
The camera worked in 2,600 degrees?? I guess at least 99% of people can just suspend reality and believe that what they're watching is real.....like the Tesla with the mannequin in "space"??? Wake up and grow up people!!! This is all fake....just like NASA.
2:05 is it just me or the heat shield are falling off?
You people couldn't find someone that is a bit more manly to comment ???? This fellow sounds like a flamer 😂
As a KSP player, I know this wobble too well lmao
Notice to flat earthers....nobody fell off the earth at 2:45
What a load of complete and utter bullshit.  This is nothing but CGI lies.  Please, people, do NOT believe this shit!
Powoli do przodu ale w tym tempie to chyba tego lądowania na Marsie nie dożyje pozdrawiam
So we have all this footage outside our atmosphere and ppl out here dead ass believing that the earth is flat?
What is everybody going crazy for? That was fugazie!
I love watching rockets spin out of control as they plummet back towards earth, engines burning up in the plasma. Thanks Musk, truly a masterpiece.
Very cool
It's a pleasure to see the Earth spinning so beautifully around the ship, but why did the Chinese throw these debris on the fuselage?
LMFAO BLIND LEADING THE BLIND. FOOLS I TELL YOU...
That was about as fake and ghuey as they come.......
Is the ship falling apart?
The biggest “MAN-MADE” object ever in space to be precise
This video is confirmation that the Earth is flat and motionless as well as the Sun is only 3000 miles above the Earth's surface. Large bodies of water and clouds DO NOT curve to form an Earth ball.
Nowadays the show on space is like the launch of a new smartphone. Just show and shout. Presented by nice geeks with nice smiles. We're supposed to be happy and amazed, but we need to know why. And nothing new, images of Earth from space are always the same: a lot of clouds and some water, nothing really interesting.
The problem is not that there are bad cops. The problem is that bad cops are treated like they are doing nothing wrong. Internal affairs often finds no wrong doing while there is clearly wrong doing. The fraternity of cops will not fire bad cops they will protect them and cover for them. Other cops will go along with a false arrest when a bad cop dose it. City’s will cover for bad cops and hire cops that have had to resign for bad behaviors elsewhere those are the reasons cops are hated because there is no justice for bad cops 99% of times.  less than one percent of bad cops get prosecuted. When bad cops start getting fired and or arrested for their crimes then we will start to like cops until then there are no good cops until you prove your self.
So this spacecraft is apparently bigger than the Saturn five rocket ?
Why do we never see in front view of what’s in front of the spacecraft.  Or is that just the studio?
First test didn't make it out of the atmosphere. Second test didn't make it back INTO the atmosphere. So naturally, the third test will have human life on board.
My IRobot can find it's way back home too.
Such crude and backwards tech to my Ancestors, it is hilarious, how behind people are.  Did you know, that man is easily several hundred years behind where they should be, because of people like Musk and poor Governments, greed and only a handful of people developing things.  This means that man has been limited to what they have now, which is crude and backward tech.    I can show you all what I mean by how crude this tech is, what you see on  offering here or at NASA, lol.  It is a joke, pathetic in comparison to the Ancestors level.  The awesome thing about all this claims I make, is that I actually have solid evidence and proof.  No one can sit here and dig at me, whine at me, call me crazy, because I have not only got full on evidence to prove what you all do not know about, and it is something I was born with.  So you can marvel at tech that is 10s of thousands if not 100s of thousands, millions of years behind that of the original people of this planet.  Man is not the first and will not be the last creatures to  inhabit this planet, because there genuinely are things going on in the background, that would astonish you, but are daily and normal for me.  It is a duty, and a sacrifice too, what I know, that you do not want to know, because you have been drip-fed lies for the most part and drip-fed information that is crude and backwards. This is to keep you all wondering, and of course manipulated to believe ONE story and ONE story only.  Fear does that.
same bullcrap. camera fail. no camera on front of it
It is obviously tumbling out of control and fatally burning up on the unprotected side(s). Meanwhile, the babbling announcers truly have no clue of what they are seeing, or that the uncontrolled reentry attitude already means total loss of the spacecraft, long before the AMAZING video feed cuts off. I guess it's REALLY hard to find intelligent help these days😂
It's all a lie
People are clapping like they're watching circus 🎪 😂
I really don`t understand why you keep spending that vast amount of money when the world is in such a bad position, everyone seems to be trying to kill each other, global warming seems to getting worse,
So, let's go to the moon. Or can we make it through the radiation belts & have enough fuel? 😮
yeah cameras not melting )) good show
A alta temperatura não queimou a câmera externa. Acredito.
Utter crap
Flat earthers hate him.
I see what seems to be some deffects on the fusselage and it seems as it is continuously shedding off pieces of the fusselage... Columbia desintegrated because of a fusselage deffect caused during lift off...  how can this one re-enter successfully?
What are the things flying by?🤔
2:36 look at those mountains , insane
Is there still a hole in the O zone ?
Unbelievable 👍👌🤦
Pretty awesome pics of reentry, but the blond was more awesome.
The real reason for the globe lie is to keep us away from God, making us think we are just a tiny, insignificant crumb in the universe. So that we don't question anything and continue to allow ourselves to be enslaved. If the Truth of the Flat Earth comes to light then the Earth system as it is now will no longer function and that is exactly what will happen. the revelation is getting closer and closer
nice greenscreen
BAH-HIND
Fake. 😉
Super-exciting super-awesome super-winderful, eat up the earth , hijack our future by technocrats by industrialists by politicians. We are so clever ingenious , thumbs up for the abyss of space, our friend in becoming extinct.
Watching it burn up while trying and failing at reentry????
Who's paying for these stuff ups...And I don't think its Elon Musk...
I wanted to see it actually leave into space but I seen no evidence
An amazing moment ruined by the 2 people that would just not stop talking during the reentry burn portion.
Earth looks round to me. Where is the flat earth?
Spacex is maxspsce!!!
That’s funny it never leaves earth atmosphere
not sure it re-entered as much as is burned up
Am I the only person who hates hearing everyone cheering for every little thing that happens like the five-year-olds watching a magic show? I want to hear the technicalities and what we are actually looking at.
I hope im still alive to see a colonized mars
You guys know that these images show it tumbling its way to destruction, right?
Absolutely incredible!
This is nothing. This is a walk in the park compared to the re-entry I had this morning at 6 am. I said, 'honey, I'm home,' and her only response was this bottomless, negative-Kelvin stare. Badabing!  Oh somebody gimme a rimshot, please!
Farenheit? Are you stuck in the middle age? Since elon is maga... no surprises😮
Lord Shiva protect us from these satanic liars.

Incredible!!!
FAKE X
Its FAKE.
The CGI is pretty darn good!
It almost turn the earth 360° effortlessly
This is so fake
'You know it's fake because it looks so fake'..  The manufacturer (of Elon Musks human suit)
thats a green screen ...people think this is real?  🤣thats CGI ....how brainwashed can you be?😂
To all "flat earth" believers...heres your proof...its not flat
This must be great for earth's environment .....not 😢 no wonder the world is a mess . They try to tell us to use electric cars etc 😅😂the lies are palpable,  super exciting !, God help us all !! The money spent is disgusting too 😢
NASA needs to pay attention and step the game up... Goddamned shame when a private citizen Elon Musk (owner) is outdoing a country (USA) who has "Air Superiority". EDIT: Elon will no doubt be the FIRST trillion-aire if he continues on this path... and I know its NOT about money for him, its about pioneering... making a NEW path.... I wish I could be alive 1000 years from now when humans escape the solar system... there are more galaxies than grains of sand on ALL the beaches on earth. I wish I could be alive when humans break the barrier.
Why is the camera still operating at those temperatures? If it protrudes from the body of the vehicle wouldn’t it experience the heat?
CGI is amazing
I can’t wait 50 years from now when the “We never went to Mars” conspiracies start
NICE GREENSCREEN  PUPPET SHOW!  WHAT A CROCK OF BULLSHIT!!!  All you people believe this Crap!!!
This is so stupid.  What good will all this do for mankind?
The re-entry was rather lispy.
How much is the Starlink in space package...
can’t break that dome yet
16-17 thousand mph
The female commentator has a more masculine voice then that dude.
It never left our atmosphere!
Why does it start going arse first? Is this to decelerate?
Why is the filmed w/ with a fish eyelines? FAKE. High 'Altitude Footage' w/ a standard Lense doesn't reflect this video's exaggerated example [?]
'Starship' is a bit of a stretch isn’t it? Build one to make it around the moon and back first.
Please gay guy, shut the hell up!!!
CGI is so good these days ..
This guy has a voice made perfect for a Sesame Street puppet.
would  the heat shield  be effective  at protecting  against  laser  weaponry
pretty flat up there
Space should be in quotes,   cause they didn't go that high.
These people screaming like excited kids who have drunk too much coffee is ridiculous!
Outmostsphere
The diverse commentators brought me back down to earth. They couldn't find a qualified transgender to make it a trio?
that dude sounds so gay
I can only assume the people screaming are Elon's employees... "If I don't hear you cheering, don't bother coming in to work tomorrow"
The heat of re-emtry is caused by the compression of air in front of the ship, not friction.  Compress any air and it get hotter.
BS
What's the big chunks of stuff that looks like it's flying off of it?
................................................can someone remind these democrat bozos that we "apparently" did all this over 50 years ago. What do they think they are doing? - and what's with the football crowd? Well did it re-enter? Saw some cgi generated interference as it apparently entered the atmosphere - but that's about it...
Congratulations to Elon Musk and SpaceX for groundbreaking video of spaceship descent.
Almost looks real
I always wanted to hear Mulvaney narrate a space video after being fired from Budlight
cgi for idiots
Not one realistic commitment? Lol
Wow. video feed is amazing.
Tahts all a big Bullshit and Fake
Flat earth?
can i see  finally whole earth?
Nice, but why people screeming like a class of young kids ??
And people really believe we live under a dome.
Wow! It didn't burst into flames like a Tesla!
Man is just great.  All we have today is because of people, scientist, and technology.  This shit about thank god is all bullshit.  AI is coming I am sure the Catolics and Christians are busy trying to insert stuff in to the biggetst lie the bible and all religion, that way they can control people  and keep them for seeing the truth.
UFO all around 😮from start
U R kill our planet...
Try a different commentator!  And as for the background noise, it sounds a lot like students in a college cafeteria! It's not exactly an Apollo liftoff.  Professional, a video game...just strange, who knows?
FAKE
When nerds get together they have a nerd party this is it lol 😂
0:05, 0:41 what are those flying object?
WOW
What was all the debris floating around at the beginning? Was it ice coming off the spacecraft?
We are still capable of amazing things.
So far 847 Ex-Twitter employees have given this a thumbs down.....😂
" we love you Elon musk"
A whole lot of bull, fantasy for embiciles and the ignorant
TRASH turned into a TV show, thats discusting
Fahrenwhat ?
that is one of them there tumble entry's.
What are those debris we see flying ?
👏
Boy, I love stuff like this. I used to always be into science when I was a kid so I spent all my time watching stuff like this and just seeing what people can do. All knowledge belong to everybody.
Offer free trips for billionaires. We live in hope.
🥱😴
Oh the world isint flat
Aahh, und wer aahh braucht diese aahh ganze Scheiße
The speaker......"Hi there thailor........"
This is quite beautiful. Thank you lord for your never ending wonders you provide us. And thanks to Elon for pushing forward. Between this and the eclipse I feel very lucky this year!
Absolutely the most incredible rocket science together with GNSS technology in my lifetime
Not a single flat earth comment. Where’s my daily chuckle gone?
Big fake (blue beem)
Veryvoox
Что ж они так орут?
lmao "It looks so fake it has to be real" This is really sad... the cheering is so cringe its like being in a cult ritual.
oh my goodness, this gay commentator so ruined this
Earth's atmosphere 62 miles (?) Earth's atmosphere 220,000 miles (?)  Would Y'all make up yer minds! All of you BLIND BELIEVERS gotta start thinking for yourselves!
Lol
Flamboyant
Faik AI imaginery.
why the frantic cheering tho? is it 1960?
Fake crowd noises. Are you effing kidding me? Get outta here, Musk.
Shouldnt the atsmosphere be like entering 1000mph side winds
I just want a cell signal  lop
lol, fake
I thought earth was flat and this was all staged everyone is an actor
Please Elon sue the Australian E - Safety commissioner.
hahahahaha
so we doing 400 km per second and we are 70km up?  shouldn't take too long to get down then?
#SpaceTheFinalFrontier  These are the #VoyagesOfSpaceXStarshipEnterprise  Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before!!!
screamimg on cartoon
Why doesn't the external camera get hot at burn in.....
So fake
Fake af
A bigger load of shit I have not seen.
Tout sonne faux !
Video is not real video.  Its fake, CGI... They fun with our brain.
What a bunch of bullshit let’s pan out and see what the Earth looks like
Wow! Mind boggling! Never stops amazing me!
Fake,fake  plate aarde wal disney fake
Its really incredible views when  SpaceX Starship re-enter Earth's atmosphere in this video.  When I am watching this clip , my heart is full of ineffable joy.  Unfortunately the feeling mix under in my heart when I remember the tragically moment of Space Shuttle challenger accidents whose disintegrate when entering our atmosphere. I could imagine they were completely burned during re-entering. Happy watching also feeling so sad at the same time
Rip camera, got burned into his death
for flat earthers, the curvurture of the earth is actually done by an AI computer rendering the pictures instantly while we are watching.. you may think this is a little confusing explaination... it is!!
Let's talk monetary value. How many of those wunnerful heat shields could house 100 homeless Americans? 100? 10? Or just 1 maybe?
Easily excitable, aren’t they? Bless ...
Hey., I  can see my house from here.
😅😅😅😅
This is an example of when ice burns
CGI has really come a long way...plebs going to believe this BS
Be honest, working for any company under Elon's Leadership is the best job in the world.
She: nice nails!!
There is no space you can’t go out there you will die it’s all a lie space is under water
Nice CGI.
All fake folks
watching a 10 story building tumble uncontrolled into earths atmosphere is one hell of a show  :D
Not even thag impressive, I’ll enjoy it when I see something pass our moon and not sit in our stratosphere
At 1:50-2:20, why is there so much debris falling off the ship?
Did anybody else see all that space trash?
No stars intresting….#earthflat📣
The Falcon 9 is not the only spacecraft to land upright!!! https://youtu.be/nlVcAJFU-5E?si=K3co2GilykTc7_57
🙏🇺🇸🚀🚀🚀🇺🇸💓
Americans sound like Gibbons when they get excited.
Annoying and hilarious to hear the reactions from the nerd Farm
these starlinks are insane!
🔥
That's fake
USA is glory of the world amazing USA look to this amazing launching USA is the glory of the world
3:58
Why are there only certain  views
How does a male develop that kind of affeminized voice ?  Asking for a friend .
Lots of bolocks !!!
Looks flat to me 🤷🏽‍♂️
Go pro not fire😅
I don’t think mars has landing pads
And how is the ship protected against heat ?
I'll buy that for a dollar !.
But even if it is real it still proves and shows a flat horizon & inability to go further ..don't let term "atmosphere" fool you into thinking they went any further
You think movies are fake but believe this as if the same and more tech isn't being applied just calling it "news" so you think it's real
It didn't go to "space"
Yall sleep
Wow ! Look how flat the Earth is. Its amazing.😂
4:44 star ship was up side down
These people are full of shit... 50 plus years AFTER allegedly landing on the moon, they’re still cheering upon re-entry and WHERE is the hi def video footage of earth when they were far enough to record a ball? - There isn’t any because they didn’t do crap they’re all FOS.
elon should have plopped the ship on Biden's front lawn 😂
That’s a pretty decent fake film🤔
3:03 … It’s falling apart
Would you like to know what these small objects are that pass by Starship every moment?
OK so what's the big deal. NASA apparently landed on the moon in 1969.
The horizon is fake.  The horizon doesn't curve at these heights -used fish lenses (wide-angle).
What was the material you could see coming off the vehicle before it re entered the atmosphere?
I want to see infront video of that space reach the firmament. Why you don't show us that view..?😢😢😢😢
fakest thing i've ever seen
Imagine if the only camera view allowed on your car was facing backwards like all the space rockets.  Never a dashcam like on cars and even airplane videos.  Nope, if it's rocket, you're not allowed to see video out the windshield evidently. Has anyone ever seen a video of the view out the front like common sense would dictate, you know, like we do on cars?  Didn't Jelly Roll just say the windshield is bigger than the rear view mirror for a reason?  This looks like a bad reason here.
Simply beautiful and amazing. The minds that go into this are incredible. Thank u.
One day this is going to be a shuttle.
The commentator wants a boyfriend way too bad.
Fake😂
Whats the difference between a comet and the starship does it effect the atmosphere microorganisms below the stratosphere
Kinda corny all the cheering
NITIDAMENTE QUE ISSO É CGI 😂😂😂😂😂😂
People will say it's CG lol.
Technology is fantastic! 2600° and that camera keeps working. Leave my phone in the sun for three minutes and I can’t send a text.😂😂
Ben made illegal deals with nasa and transfers assets and property in illegal court cases and conspired with banks. Military and cops know and conspired with. Ties to all courts churches and banks also. Fake revolution coming and also heros. I tracked all of them. They jacked me and said i would lose my house in court and also always give me ben for lawyers illegally. Automatically send to me. Then try to say thyley are ttorney in fact when i never gave them rights. They are holding my house hostage till they getva deal they wantml. Im making them turn it al over with no money because i follow law and they dont. They laid lawyers and judges for their own outcome. Conflicts of interest. If i win in curt thy ignore it until they get answers that suit them.
My mistake 0:35
Did you see the face in the clouds looking back at the camera at 8:07?
He sounds like a real ponce!
Why this hysterical yelling?
very sophomoric bunch of children cheering and gasping, seems forced
0:05 what are the two objects below?
Fake, didn’t even look real
Face at 1:20
Absolutely amazing Wow 👍🇨🇦👍🚀🚀🚀
What ever is up there, is jush flotting in space. What a bunch of BS.
some of the greatest video editors alive. never continuous footage🥱...
🙌
All self declared scientists ..go and study😂
Why are people yelling and clapping? Wow, it's entering earth, WOW. YAAY
What is the camera made of to sustain all the heating from the drag?
Like we were watching a sports match😅
how the heck did we ever go to the moon what a hoax
Anyone else see a crazy looking face around the 1:11 mark till around 1:24 in the top right corner?? Or am i trippin
Strange creations of the creator almighty Allah. We should worship to this creator only.
What was all that stuff flying around off of it
I know it wasn't so beautiful back then, but you guys realize the soviets could do this in the sixties reliably, right?  Only their crafts survived, while this won't be reusable any time.  It is a beautiful destruction of a craft I give you that.
Very Cool!!! How many homes could have Tesla Solar systems and Tesla energy linking them to the grid selling surplus energy with the money spent on this very cool accomplishment??! Hundreds??! Thousands??! #ResignElonMusk #DefundElonMusk
I thought the earth was flat
This camera angle gives me so damn "Interstellar" vibes... *goose bumps* *hears organ plying*  "It's not possible." "No, it's necessary."
😂😂😂😂 what a big fast lie. The 3 gentleman are laughing at how well they created this video thru CGI. I’m AMAZED! To see how many people believe this lie!!!
My condolences to the Flat Earth Society
RIP Flat Earthers 😂
If that idiot stopped talking for three seconds we could hear the breakup
Elon knows its flat
I want to buy stocks
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Isiah(KJV)  14:12-15  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!  13For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:  14I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.  15Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
72 miles firm time
FARTHEST & Fastest
NASA dimana?
No space, imposible this speed, Its all a real FAKE. Dont believe in this illusions
Satanism
Can you tell everyone in the background to please keep it down?   LOL
lol how many of you actually believe it’s real😆
lol and the claps and yelling is also fake
You can tell it’s real because it looks so fake
😮 just wow!!!
Cool to see progress. Want to see full video launch all the way to a moon orbit and get a space station there in this quality with normal lens no wide view before I will be as excited as most are. Plasma not that special. We can make that in our house every day with Tesla coils. Is space X going to do any MHD thrust?
😂 nice cgi
Baloney
Wow, your way of putting it is much easier to absorb than the more accurate “tumbling out of control, rapidly disintegrating” verbiage.  You should think about creating marketing materials for pesticides and lawn darts.
who the hec is talking really we got two flamers the spacex and the commentator
"The biggest flying object ever in space"? :D Right...and the cheerings sound like a senseless baseball match <3
01:09 play at 1/4 speed.  What is that small yellow/orange/light brown object on the left of the screen moving bottom to top? 01:13 play at 1/4 speed.  Further away, left but middle of screen, white small "rock-like" tumbling object, also moving bottom of scree to top of screen? 01:15 play at 1/4 speed.  Two more white "rock-like" objects fly from middle bottom screen upwards to top of screen? 01:16 play at 1/4 speed. See the larger right bottom to top tumbling white rock-like larger piece of debris? 01:38 play at 1/4 speed.  See in the distant half a dozen rock-like (whatever it is, fuel bits-exhaust forming these shapes)?  What is this debris?   Is it just from the Ship engines fuel exhaust bits jetting themselves in these movements?  01:40 play at 1/4 speed.  Here the debris bits seems to come from the Ship's top end though as they are between the camera's view and the Ship as they move lower left to upper right.    What debris is this?  01:46 a rather large flipping debris piece is visible.  01:52 is another large flipping piece of debris.  01:57 play at 1/4 speed.  Closer view of the debris or is this fuel bits? 02:05 play at 1/4 speed.  A very large flipping piece flies by.  02:12 ditto.   Are these heat shield plates disintegrating and flying off?  If the above are shield plates (some of them) I'm curious why don't you bevel the final plates' edges to smooth into the Ship rather than this teeth edge that has the abrupt edge that is NOT beveled into the Ship side?   That I would think would greatly eliminate future plates peeling off!     CONCLUSION:   Research armadillo or all other similar life forms plating and spend the bucks to use that!  And/or SOME other firm R&D  space ship plating and make it perfect.   AND Ship platting is critical, it has to be perfected.
What  is flying by at 1.31 min to 1.38 min ? Looks like it's below the clouds.
Oh look, the earth is flat 😂😂
This is a firework 😉👍
So fake..
Sort of takes the shine off space exploration when the worlds a train wreck!
Thinking about the old-school Apollo days, I would imagine flight director Gene Krantz yelling at the folks cheering in the control room to "shut up!" Haha!
Why are you people clapping at nothing? It's not all that. Relax.
Old technology with bells and whistles. New tech is needed.
I wonder if people in the 50s could have predicted we would watch space stuff with a live peanut gallery crowd whooping things up in the future.
The crowd noise piped in is distracting to say the least
Cartoon
This is amazing!!   Engineering breakthroughs never cease to amaze me
This is real cool.
Fake, oml, fools hate knowledge, Simple CGI
Any Flerfs here?
NASA is false advertising, we never landed on the moon no human has ever left Earth's exosphere 🤷🏾
Wording is everything, never left Earth's atmosphere🤦🏾‍♂️
As we boldly go where no man has gone before 🖖  God- like capabilities. I really enjoyed this video, thank you🙏
I don't want got hear those morons making all that noise
NoN STOP :   blablablablablablabla
Why the big orgasm, why are they going nuts? we have seen similar space and Earth footage before this, did Elon just save the entire Planet?
how can people be so dumb?
AND NASA went to the Moon and back in the 60s and in 2024 they celebrating re entry?Musk then said human will colonize Mars come 2025 but they busy raving about re entry?😂
And people will watch this and still believe the Earth is flat..
GO GO GO SPACE X. STARSHIP. WHOOOAAAAHHHH👍👍👍👏👏👏👋👋👋♥️🇵🇭
If the speed is about 26000 km/hr then why is it taking so much time to reach earth.   What speed it is showing??
Why does everyone talk with a lisp?!?
That guy REALLY needs to fix his lisp!!! Same for the girl actually!!! Geeezzzz!!!
Are you sssserioussss?!? Sssstarlink?!? Sssssignal pickupssss?!?
Has anyone noticed the round object passing by at high speed?,,, we are not alone.😮
LOL
We are becoming the aliens
What?..Bezo you not impressed?
Yeah the plasmas cool but what’s all that stuff flying about?
"Take that"! Flat earthers😂😂😂😂
Mesmerizing just so beautiful to see the planet slowly revealing in the distance then just wow.
all that pollution . such a shame
And I also learned I have stuck poop
This footage is nothing less than a revelation to my discerning eyes. The clarity of picture made me realise just how accurate the digital effects artists are when designing the space visuals in Sci-Fi movies, because the friction burn depicted in the reality of the Starship re-entry almost appears fake looking. Edit : The fundamentals witnessed in this genuine SPACE X Starship re-entry are indiscernible from today’s digital imagery creations.
The closest experience you can get to being in the space for an ordinary guy is VR. My experience is from playing a game Red Matter 2. There were several scenes where I felt terrified. My feet were on the floor of my appartment yet my eyes were telling me that I'm in the space. Not everybody is so susceptible, I am.
Expensive CGI 😂
1:10 look like a ufo pass over the shuttle
So what happened,  did it burn up, they didnt show us
That was so incredible 😮 wow. This is such important data.
If the announcer's would just SHUT-UP. WTF
Incredible, that's how re-entry looks like from space, it's beautiful to view our home from that distance.
Oh, I could care less spend your money on something useful
Sorry bro. Are U sure this is not a framing video that U made looks like real ? Who took the picture of this camera, ?  What is the melting point/temperature of  the glass of of the camera when entering Earth ? Sorry I don't believe it, it's still hoax video.....
Самая лучшая ракета ведущая!!!
Impressive, but is there a video of the actual explosion? Seen from the ground (or rather, from the sea?)
It went down because it tumbled.. but i think the payooad door being open is what ultimately ended its existence
Allways fake images! Allways.
Amazing❤❤❤
People actually believe this BS?
This is AMAZING
Good morning ❤❤❤
❤❤
The clarity is fascinating, the fact that it lasted that long into the entry is incredible, I was 10 when the Apollo mission landed on the moon, those grainy images were amazing but these images of the earth are now etched in my mind forever. Thank you. 🇺🇸
That was freaking awesome ladies and gentlemen. 💯👍🏽
How cool is this?!
and people still believe earth is flat????!!! 2:42
Love how they wont show you space just earth nothing beyond
and the second time they use it or not? I haven't heard of them being used a second or third time
Oh my God,!!!! what a brain !!!God gave super, super brain to human beings. God is great.
aerodynamic control alone from the actuating fins on SS will not be enough to ensure correct attitude during reentry, it has to be in the correct position before hitting atmosphere, not tumbling irregularly like on this testflight. Needs some kind of larger gyroscopic reaction wheel or RCS system to control attitude in vacuum. Havent the dudes at spacex been playing enough realism overhaul KSP?
Awesome!
goodပါ
"The heat shields doing their work" Until they didnt
And still can't build high-speed bullet train technology.
White folks tearing up our atmosphere as usual, always trying to play God 🤦🏾‍♂️
Truly awesome
There's enough space junk up there
It blew up My mistake It’s like this is new technology. Rockets are experimental  Of course Eventually rockets can safely and effectively go up And one day we can dream about getting pic of earth from orbit and go to the Moon  Dreams are for dreamers
Where’s the landing part?
is it really moving at that speed.. 26,600 kmph smthing... y it seems as if its just floating at say 30kmph may be 🧐
There were no stars, planets, moon  There was no view of landing  The tiles are not ceramic, they are chalk  The views never show land  They never announce where on earth they are over  They never land say in Japan in 20 minutes proving the existence.  This is total bullshit
👎👎👎 the speed vs altitude must be wrong , if 26700 km/h ... must/k coming down with 7.4 km/s ...
Very Cool!!
The tiles look sketchy and unreliable, more like props.
What a time to be alive
1:30 whats about this things flight in formation?
Absolutely fantastic bit of footage thankyou all for sharing this first reentry makes you proud to be a human again 🎉
Was that space junk early in the video that the craft was moving through? Or was that pieces from its own construction coming off for some intentional/unintentional reason? I was confused with that part of the video, they didnt mention anything about it
Over 26 thousand kilometres per hour, and the camera image looks that clean? yeah right... this a is all cgi.
elon musk: you can tell it's real because it looks so fake
amazing video
Wow wow wow it's so amazing thanks for this beautiful actual footage. Cebu Philippines
5:24 you mean heating system 😢
"the biggest flying object ever in space" had me dying
The pure joy
Yeah I agreed.
looks like it is dangling off a weather balloon or something
What a bunch of bs
roflmao Already reported as false information!! wake up people!!
So 611 viewers think there is no Southern Hemisphere?    lol at FET
Call Of Duty Modernwarfare 2 Wolverine's https://youtube.com/shorts/KGgDgliKzxo?si=PPDVI51WH7-EfVnD
Beautiful 😍 Normally These Things Only Happens In The Hollywood 😅😂 Movie Tricks. This Awesome ❤
Another failure. If NASA destroyed so many rockets they would have terminated the agency.
What a waste of money. Yeah we went to the moon alright 🤡🤡🤡
This is one of the most amazing pieces of footage I've ever seen.
Toy maker.
The self-proclaimed philanthropists throw their money out the window on projects like these. They litter the orbit and pollute the environment by burning quantities of fuel that all Tesla e-cars together will never save on the roads, not to mention the environmental damage caused by the production chains. Together they finance Corona projects and trigger mass psychoses in order to test extremely questionable substances on a large scale on humanity, even though all risks and dangers are and were known. They hoard the money that economic areas and, above all, people lack, ensure that the money supply increases and thus devalue the money that most people already have too little of, so that it stays that way and they then keep the most valuable thing we humans have To obtain possession of these worthless, mass-produced promissory notes, also called money, from them, or rather they knowingly devalue the lives/time of ordinary people for their own benefit...
Paid with tax cuts and government handouts.
Fabrification
Amazing ❤ shame it broke up😢
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!!
😂😂😂😂
What movie is this from  the cgi is amazing
Wwww2w(i
The male announcer sounds INCREDIBLY effeminate  😒 He doesn't have a single drop of testosterone in his entire body.   He sounds like a Gender-Confused person who cries over pronouns.  😒  His style of speaking is NOT suited for the nature of the topic that he's reporting on. I acknowledge his personal "Right" to be effeminate,  but his voice is CLEARLY the WRONG choice for this particular assignment.   😒   His style of "announcing" is better suited for LOGO or some other LBGT-Oriented Network.   😒 I wish him great success at LOGO.  😊 Good luck Sir/Ma'am/They/Them !!!
Earth's atmosphere huh. Seems as if we never did leave Earth from the very beginning but wait didn't we go to the moon? Nope never did  . What a bunch of bull
Reenter? Did they even leave?
Meanwhile.....Buzz Aldrin is somewhere walking on the darkest side of the Moon.....
The crowd noise sounds fake.  @PatrickRobinson hey, clownboy, you're obsessed :)
So, why doesn't the camera lens melt during reentry? Can somebody answer please.
fairy tale
Camera would've came in handy before Feb 2003 Columbia re-entry
Meanwhile, That Footage Quality from the various Moon Landings recently....
forse un giorno andremo sulla luna
Imagine seeing this with a VR headset, being able to turn around and see everything. What a moment.
Man that blondie is fucking hot
the farthest we always get hmm
The real Rocket Man❤ it's what artists sing about❤
It lets you know how very small our little world is🌍♥️ and it gives you a view that no man can create we can only picture it❤ thank you very beautiful pictures❤
ELON, YOU ARE TRULY AMAZING, EPIC. PURE GENIUS, CLASSIC. SHEER, ARTICULATE SKILLSMANSHIP, WITH GREAT, WONDERFUL, CRAFTSMANSHIP. CONGRATULATIONS ELON👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏. BRILLIANT JOB. LOVE YOU MOOR, ALWAYS AND FOREVER MORE WITH UNCONDITIONAL LOVE 🙏😇💯🥰😘♥️💋💋💋💋♥️♥️♥️🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲.
Wow can't believe what i'm saying it's amazing
Thank you SpaceX for this incredible view of re-entry. I remember being in school 2nd grade and watching astronauts walk on the moon on a black and white television. Never though I'd see anything like this.
What is the age range & the average age of the people that can be heard yelling and cheering?
Super exciting and super Amazing!❤💯👍
Space X has a trained cheering section , how obedient they are .
Wow
Looked fake asf
lol "Re-enter?" they never go above 255k miles which means they never leave earths atmosphere lol.
Incredible CGI absolutely fantastic well done guys!!! 👏 the re-entry was just phenomenal. Remember folks....if its being filmed and reported, it must be true!! We must trust the government. Cant wait for more vaccines
The dude talking wanted to swallow his mic for sure.
Amazing! Wow!
You blow my mind sometimes  you are so brilliant my beautiful man
You are so brilliant babe
Esacketly
I am smiling honey
Wow
WHOOOOHOOOO 🚀🐑🐑🐑👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 lmfao 🤣🤣🤣
Wow amazing looking baby i am first time looking very shocking  super sonic  teacknalogi
And the most incredible part is that the camera could still stand the heat ❤❤❤
Elon Musk top g goat of all time . Congrats
The only way to Heaven, is not by rocket but by faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Nice CGI
Incredible 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Assuming a rifle bullet is traveling at a modest 3,000 ft/sec , that means rentry is approx 6.5 times faster than a rifle bullet or 15,000 mph.  Unreal
Isn't it strange that rock and iron burns up on re-entry to the Earth but these ships supposedly don't I think it's all bull crap and furthermore where did you ever see that many clouds on Earth
If a billionare was able to make a spaceship, you don't think an agency with over 50 trillion since 1960 doesn't have them out there?
Zero attitude control. Uh huh.
Flat earthers are so butt hurt right now lmao
Hahahahahahaha just RUBBISH science fiction total rubbish
are the flat earth people watching this you can see the earth round
Elon Musk should be treated like a national treasure… Democrats are out to destroy him by going after Tesla all because he doesn’t have TDS like them and agrees more with Trump than the modern Libtard..  I would love to see Elon do two things…  become the George Soros of the right.. and  threaten Biden to move his operations to China if they don’t leave him alone.
100 km yükseklikte bu kadar atmosfer sürtünmesi olduğunu bilmiyordum. Alevler 65 km de başlıyor sanıyordum.
Man the happiness in the voice of all the workers
Psalms 19:1 is on Wernher von Braun's gravestone.
What are those floaters starting at around 3:57 to about 4:06.....?
What s that debris passing the spacecraft ??  At about 2:00 mark
nice graphics the new quantum computers make it look so real
Absolutely loving the personnel in flight control. Looks like everyone is a white guy which proves Elon only hires on merit. No fat welfare mothers to be seen.. SpaceX has proven NASA to be just another incompetent bloated cancerous appendage to Washington.
Hmm that's spinning and burning up. Oh well who cares when it's a billion of tax payers money 😂
Problem back planet gravitation . Heawy vibration.  Airdynamic form .  Rocket standart Verticaly frame and big gravitation Heawy defects.    Correction gravitation Balancing weights control.  Earth planet Heawy gravitation.  Other planet gravitation little (soft ) minimal weights

Flat earthers are not gonna like this 😂
People need to be warned NOT to attempt this at home
Plazmayı ben de çok beğendim ama mekiğin baş aşağı dönmesi tam bir bela gibi duruyor...yıldızlar küre şeklinde.. yıldızlar arası araçlarında küre şeklinde olması mı gerek acaba... silindirik bir parçaya o hızlarda düzenli bir hareket rejimi sağlamak meydan okuyucu olacak
Where is the camara placed? Never seen so much stabilisation during an turbulent fflight! It’s like the ship is static and the background mooving. Looks very unrealistic, thats why we know its real, right!!!🤣
That is so goddamn dumb to be cheering like that
Kerbal Space Program 2 will need some new re-entry effects.
the Borg cube is much bigger
Im sorry, but if they are moving at 25,000-26,000km/h reentry would literally take a couple of seconds.....
Amazing 😊
What are these humans shouting about.... 😉
Look like it’s spinning and swinging, hanging from one of those big weather balloons 🎈
Cool video but I can't watch it all because of the narrator over pronouncing the letter s it's irritating me
Nice video but I couldn't watch it all because of that one moderator over pronouncing the S like gays people do
Earth is flat... said no person with a brain ever!😂
Hay all you Flatearthers, notice anything?
Subhan Allah
If that is the first time Re-entering, she says how they do it back when they went to the moon?????
17,000 miles Phr??? Crazy how Technology is.
Very very cool
Was there a  hockey game on in the background?  the hell was with the cheering?
Fake NASA 💩👎🤮
And...it's all fake😂
Fake
Congratulations 🥳
Thank you Elon and all your family for coming to the USA and making us a better country. Love our Teslas. Admire Space X. Appreciate x
The lox and ch3 indicators show tanks empty or nearly empty. The pumps may have cavitated in this situation or completely lost suction.
Now why would you need to super speed things up out to space and as fast as possible back down again.     Is it our new fast food delivery system.   Nope sorry folks only weapons of mass destruction here.   To bad for growth let’s just televise what we do but shhhhhhhh don’t say anything incriminating 😂
what a amazing CGI ...
Congratulations 🎊 👏 Sir Elon musk 7:10
I'm confused. The space shuttles went in and out of Earth's atmosphere many times, so how is this event here supposed to be so amazing??
Some nerds SOUND like nerds. The heck with re-entry data, what about 30 beef sticks for $30 dollars!
So how did the lunar module in 1969 re-enter the atmosphere and withstand all that heat without heat tiles? How did the camera withstand the heat? Same as all the false nuclear bomb testing the states claimed to be doing but a camera recorded and withstood it all. lol
The number one contributor to climate change
You can tell is real because it looks so fake
Wish those dorks in background were as passionate in praise for Jesus and the creator.
The commentary would’ve been better explained by Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson.
Why can’t it start showing the Earth from higher to finally silence the flat-earthers?
Mooie beelden
What an achievement. Congrats Elon and his team. You’d think the leftist commi media could stop talking about that loser don sourpuss lemon and mate talk about this.
Way to go guys, much better than NASA ever could ..
CGI
Flat earthers are super quiet 😂
what is the name of this game ;)
🤯🤯🙏🙏✌🏻♥️💪🏻💪🏻🦅🦅🦅
"Success" is measured by how many people have been reached to be programmed with those Space Doctrines.
CGI Hocuspocus ....
Where are all the flat earthers too🧐🙄🤣😂
NASA+T=? The plasma is noble gasses being charged up making light, same as a neon light
Re entry into what, coming from low earth orbit😅
Call me whatever i dont believe any of this , its shamefull  to push  an agenda that  is impossible ...
Unfortunately both booster and starship can’t relight their engines. This means starship is very faulty. This also means they can’t land. So when might this rocket become reusable. If it always crashes it will never be reusable.  This means no mars no moon no reusability.
Dieser Flug war großartig❗Auch wenn die Landungen nicht gut liefen, es war sehr beeindruckend ❗
Excelent  cgi
Absolutely incredible. Throughout the history of space travel, the friction from encountering the molecules in the atmosphere produces the plasma we see in this video.
So fake 😂😂
Arrest Musk and seize Twitler etc
I saw it at Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona where I work it was amazing I didn't know what it was glad I got Video
At 1 min 16 seconds do you see the  UFO  on the side
Another Evil Musk Scam
You fools don't notice that you're being lied to. There's a dome above us. You can't penetrate it or get out of it anywhere.
No one knows the size of the universe because it is possible to get out There is a sky / dome above us there is no way out and there is no way out.
Im wondering if the flat earth theorists are still holding on to their belief.
Not a fan of hearing the people cheering in the background.  They need to stop including that in the broadcast.  It's just distracting.
Mucha cocaina
Very cool image of the Sun against the darkness of space. 2:50
People are so gullible, lmao!  Look closer and think...  Hint 1:  Pay attention to the camera versus the heat... Hint 2:  Pay attention to the heat shields versus the heat...
What a waste of money.
its really ...WoooW!!
Abrupt silence with the fail😊
Oh look the world is flat
This is legendary not like the moon lander lol I love it
Remember there is people that will see this live from start to finish and claim its fake and space doesn't exist lol.
Was that pieces of the heat shield coming off?
3:59 ~ "...this is the biggest flying object ever in space" The Apollo Saturn V ~ "So what am I?  Chopped liver?"
and one camera is all they got lol where's the  heat prob.
Amazing!
Where are the manly men???
😂 just showing it backwards. Can't even get an electric car to go 200 miles on one charge. Lol
Most incredible thing I ever witnessed
I don’t know if this was SpaceX, but something just lit up the entire sky here in Tucson, Arizona at about 730 tonight. It was pretty amazing!
They need this camera live streaming on the ISS
Where’s his man-voice?
It would have been better without the noise from all those more ons cheering. It's pretty dumb. If I was in charge of them I would have fired the lot of them. Seriously its like something from the movie idiocracy
@3:45 its just the engine thrust doing it :'D whats with the fake hype these space agancies shout over nothing. Going 27000km/h  Pointed up but not gaining altitude but still maintaining speed Going 50x faster than a commercial airline, Lol. Believe the bull, the evidence is infront of you. its just above the first line of clouds :'D
It looks so fake it must be real.😂😂
This should win an Oscar
26,000+km/hr!!!!!  Wow, just wow!
It didn't cre-enter" it never left!
What happened next?
I remember the apollo and shuttle flights. Space x is building off that work and isnt giving  recognition to that.  Decades of science and engineering happened for musky , who is neither a scientist or engineer, to get to this point.
@4:58 EXCITED REPORTER ACCIDENTALLY ADMITS THE MOON LANDINGS LIES BY CONFESSING that this is the FURTHEST EVER FLOWN
😅
UAP at 1.15 from bottom to top. Fast.
Shut NASA down immediately. They're useless.😮😅😮😅
2nd stage has to be redesigned as scaled up version of X37B to withstand reentry. Even the 1st stage might has to land as a plane, because the engines does not ignite, because of excessive vertical pressure, because of bigger size and weight
Take a shot every time they say “Starlink”
totally CGI crap.
I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏😊 please read  Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better. And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea. Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself. I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏  Amen.  I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊  ''   CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, Please forgive me and my friends and my family for our immoral acts, please help guide us in a positive direction and please help us against evil. Please save us from Hell and have mercy on our souls. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen.  ''  Please say this at least once a day for at least a month, do it longer if you want to and can 🙏  You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏😊 Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol.   Please put your hands together 🙏 bow your head and say this prayer: "CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, please know that I worship you and not any idols. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen"  Say '  Om Namah Shivaya  ' or '  Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya  ' out loud or in your head 108 times, or try to do it 1008 times 😊 try to do it everyday if you want  repeat this aloud for as long as you want to, try to do it for like an hour a day or say it in a prayer  "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner"  You can also say this prayer once a day or repeat it aloud as many times as you would like to: "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen."  Galatians 6:7-8 "Do not be deceived, GOD is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.“   Thessalonians 5:16-18 "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."  Philippians 4:6-7 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."  "O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!"   Repeat this aloud at least 3 times or as many as you want, do it everyday if you can   I apologize for all the words 😊 I know how it may look  If you can't remember the words to any prayer, pray them as you read them if you cannot look and remember them 🙏 please consider beginnning daily prayer, it is a good habit that will help you if you do it and continue to do it. Don't just read from the Book or merely say you are a member of a religion! Actually practice daily prayer, the most fundamental part of religion (or one of the most fundamental parts). What would any Holy Book be without regular prayer? It will actually help you! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What video game is this?
Congratulations!
can make space ships. to this so called *space* but cant install a normal good view camera? lol
This is so Kerbal
And the other part when landing?
Much better on mute just sayin
I'm a 35-year-old man Sitting in his garage alone watching this footage and it has brought me to tears. How could you not find something like this poetic and beautiful. It's truly a monumental step foreward in the evolution of space flight. Im proud of all the courageous and incredibly dedicated men and women involved in this astronomical achievement.
2:39 into the video  Flat earthers :  Fuck im out of here!
Everyone seems to be afraid to criticize the FAA. They are purposely trying to impede SpaceX to help the SLS program and their thousand lobbyist. This isn't obvious? Nothing went wrong on this mission except development objectives. How is that a FAA issue? The flight plan was; 1. Launch to orbit. SUCCESS  2. Exit orbit and crash in the Indian Ocean. SUCCESS.  The plan was for the ship to crash, not to land. What difference does it make whether it crashed in pieces, burnt or otherwise? This rocket is in development, and part of the development process is test failing and correcting. FAA is supposed to be concerned over safety, not to lay down the hammer on SpaceX every time their development testing isn't 100% perfect. These 3-6 month delays after every launch is making development of this rocket impossible.
Turning into crumbs..
For all that"breaking" it didn't seem to slow down much.
When spacelink returns,check the weather..
So many tiny ufos... wow...
Haha ufo at: 1:09
I wish for the speed and attitude you had miles per hour and feet high or Miles high. Not everybody knows what kilometers are.
I got to watch the return of SpaceX dragon endurance crew 7 a few days ago right after reentry over western Nebraska at 4:35 am central time. Amazing sight. Orange ball of fire streaming past me at 4:36 roughly 70 miles away. 12 mins later it parachuted into gulf by Pensacola. Evidently traveled approx 6000 mph.
no body wearing there hats back words, interesting.
I hope their starlink works better than mine.
Regresando a la tierra plana después de chocar contra el domo.....
What they don’t tell you is the reentry tiles are secured to the craft with dried grits….
here people you see, how the US spends billions of dollars from taxpayers, to fly around in the space . totally useless, and here on earth people are dying from hunger!. what a shame.
2:05 Looks like heat shield pieces breaking off. Not the first time that has been an issue for this type of vehicles. The space shuttle and others have had similar problems.
Hello flat earthers - anything to say? Just buy a ticket.
Front and rear flaps rofl
Team of Starship!,FANTASTIC JOP !!! CONGLATULATIONS! GOO LIKE!...
This is unpossible cause earth is flat. lol
Lemmings cheering like it is something.  The waste of money while our homeless sleep in urine.
Heat tiles are falling off.
What are all those pieces flying off😬
It is so primitive nowadays
Rocket 🚀 proportion is so last week
Go back up there and do your job
All this is cool, but remind me again why the Government is spending billions and billions on this? So we can get to the Moon…and then years later, Mars? Really? Maybe the money would be much better spend trying to save this planet? The environment? Global warming…rather than contributing to it.
I saw this live it was incredible! Well done to the engineers at Space X
The male announcer is more effeminate than the female announcer. Welcome to 2024.
What's all the cheering. Just watch, no need to cheer like lemmings.
Complete Bullshitt
Firmament
Gee Whizz! This must be the first! Oh wait....its another one of Musks reinventions of what's gone before. 50 years ago. Don't you guys know any history  at all?
Damn... NASA could learn a n thing or 2 from Elon about great video ..must me HD, 4k or better. (I dont know.. does anyone? )
Once you go off planet.. you don’t come back 😉
Nice CGI
Amazing how the show the launch but never the half way point showing the view to the moon and to the earth
The ship was loosing heat tiles like a house looses roofing shingles during a tornado, but the scenery was pretty.
Did it land though?
Starlink employees are traitors of Europe, supplying our enemy Russia, you guys are pathetic.
Man this is too cool. This is forward motion in evolutionary design.. Re-entry landing...what a mind blower!!
Is it a coincidence she looks like Sigouney Weavers character from that 1999 space movie?
And then break up after we mastered this over 70 years ago
how can the onboard video camera handle a temperature that can liquify steel?
incredible!
horse shit
FakeX
It is not the spaceship which is beautiful but our Earth....
Flaps of insulstion started falling apart  the moments rentry started. Most of space accidents occur due to inability of space ships to tolerate heat produced on reentry.
wow is right, this is one of the most impressive videos i have ever seen in my life 🥰🥰🥰🥰
That hex-shaped tile would make a great ash tray if it was dimpled in across its top surface instead of being flat. ♨
Hello Flat Earthers 👽
Love it !
Wonderful
Footage like this is a flat-earther's worst nightmare.
This shtick of the control room freaking out over every small thing is really tiresome. It's sad to see a bunch of engineers trying to mount a real-time PR campaign. Just fly the ship.
I refer you to STS107, live reentry of a Shuttle.
Cool. Where are the flat earthers?
So cool to see! A memorable moment in history.
Sounds like their watching a game in the background lol
and apollo went to the moon never, never never
THANKS..... PLEASE, MORE,MORE OF THESE.......ITS SUCH A GREATER INSPIRATION......FOR. THE NEXT GENERATION......I WISH, SADLY THAT THESE HAPPENED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER......AND SO HUNGRY OF KNOWLEDGE.....AND NEW TECHNOLOGY DISCOVERY.......BUT .. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE...... JUST LOOKING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.....AND THE BOOKS.....AND THE THINGS THROWING TO US .....I COLLECTED AND DIGGING.....WHEN I FIND SOME ILL ENJOYED.....BUT....THE TIME WHEN BY........AND NEED TO FOLLOW THE CONVENTIONAL WAYPATH..........BUT IM STILL WATCHING OVER THE FENCE SO FAR ITS SOOO  GREAT THE PEEKS I GET TO SEE........PLEASE,MORE, MORE OF THIS..... BUT IN THIS TIME IN PLACES NO ONE EXPECTED....... MAYBE THERE'S. IS SOMEONE IN HUNGER OF KNOWLEDGE, STARVED OF CONOCIMIENTO. BYE AND THANKS.
Sweet CGI tho.
COMPLETE BULL
Alright that was cool.
Incredible!!!!
Yea right!  Thar is just way up in the air!!! Playing with their toys!!!!
To funny. It’s a real as Bart Simpson.
Wow!!!
Where the debris is coming from? (from 1:10)
Durning these tough times it still makes me proud to be part of a race that has accomplished so much.
Basically any "flat earther" can go fawk themselves.
We got LOS in the end there
Lame!
Sounds like steam eacaping.
does she ever stop talking?
I've very little idea of what I'm watching but know enough to know that this is incredible.
Fake
super villan Elon lol. and we have no superman.
people who believe this crap deserve what is headed our way....
And Nasa set back and watches. Wishing they were doing this. Nasa not as smart as they think. SAD!!!!!
@1:16 we have a sonic cruiser whipping by.
Very interesting facinating. Congratulations to everyone involved.
Such is the audacity of man to fathom wonders that aren’t so wonderful. Mankind will get super excited about this nonsense, yet can’t see God in the equation. It should be humorous but it’s not. It’s way too contrived in rebellious activity and thoughts. We are separated for real. The supposed smart people are the actual dumb people. Godspeed!
At 1:16 mark you can see something flyng by or braking off the rocket, were those heat shield parts braking off? Looked like tiles.
Amazing how the plasma starts precisely at 100 km of altitude, which is the Karman line
That was incredible. Wow.
2mot:6:18
Well done Nvidia!
Elon Musk is truly Hugo Drax
We live in an Electric Universe🧲⚡
Re-entry through Earth's atmosphere has always been so fascinating.  Thanks for this incredible view!
Absolutely amazing at the altitude it's freezing and oxygen not so much yet fire still happens! Awesome.
I knew there had to be a few indian guys behind all this technology, I mean 7/11 indians.😂
Sony it was you?
It was a great accomplishment even though it disintegrated on the re entry.  It will be better next time!
What is the point of this testing? John Glenn orbited the earth 62 years ago. Learning what? It's been done!
Excellent stuff bro
How fast is it moving coming down? Real curious here.
FEEL THE BURN
Bob Iger is punching the air right now 😅
This is as phony as Mr Spock.
elon mask: damn, this book incredible
Flat earthers where you at😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Iies all lies firmament ice wall 🧱 🧊
FOUR TIMES the SPEED of SOUND!! AMAZING!!
incredible spy device, I mean data capture device!
What's all that crap falling off?
some good cgi
Few ufos flying past aswell
😅🤗👍
Rip Gopro on starship..
Always a fish eye lense
That's one tough camera
So it blew up at 65 km high?
Looks as fake as the Tesla they allegedly sent into orbit
My opinion - it's all fake - hexagon shape heat shield just another sign, Hexagon is one of the "brotherhood" symbols, allegedly Hexagon is on Jupiter, the sign of their fake deity
meh, this would be impressive if it didnt fall apart..
Fake and gay
Incredible views of burning plasma and hard landing into the ocean.
De jolies image du jouet d'EM, mais de peu d'intérêt
BS!
And why can’t cancer or dementia be cured in a week???  Absolutely amazing tech, bravo!!!!
Wow. Just WOW!
Looks pretty flat to me..
Lies
I can't even relate to the treachery and deception taking place here!
Additional proof that the United States is the Greatest Country on Planet Earth!
Why not just let a woman talk in this man's place?
5:45 Changing OBS scene 2
I'm sure Flat Earthers will have 'something' to say about the video of the earth's curvature!!! Good job SpaceX
CGI is really good now..........
What is a debris?
I love how this format sounds like it’s a sporting event with a couple of commentators and the crowd cheering in the background.
Am I the only person getting tiered of the forced cheers from Tesla's employees every launch good or bad 🤮
fyi, humans have not and cannot fly through space. The Van Allen belt prevents this from happening.
Makes you wonder how good the engineers were to get the Saturn V and Space Shuttle launches almost perfect on the first few tries itself (yeah there were some serious close calls too, but still).
I wish the crowd would stfu
Nice cgi. Gg
Why don’t they make the shell collect the energy of re entry. Like the way ufo do. Seems obvious to me.
Flat earth confirmed.
Will the Real Elon , please Step forward!! Wowee
Seriously ill people that think they can leave the machine!!
Wow
NASA can’t get close to Starship!
CGI galore
This picture should be all over the news, absolutely breathtaking entry.
This carries more weight than any ballgame ever could. Awesome
What are you guys now, the Enquirer?  Be better.
Amazing!
WoooooHoooo
Very exciting
Beautiful
Fantastic 😊
❤
10:41 pm
They make it look easy.
People actually believe this  ?
Good AI
Fake B.S. ROCKETS DO NOT GO TO THE HEAVENS
This will be used for a weapon not mars
If we can't build a camera that can work on space how are we going to build a aero vehicle
This is a full blown commercial for starlink.  Maybe that's the real product here.
never seen anything as cool as this
Nice! ❤ I hope starship survives re-enrty next time ❤
Did they show re-entry close to earth and where it landed?
It’s water above, water below
Useless.  Boring.
the gay guy talking ruined this video.
I got goose bumps watching this. What an amazing feat of space engineers ❤
I’m old enough to remember watching the first televised launch and re-entry of the Mercury spacecraft with John Glenn in 1962. We didn’t get to see much, but what we did was incredible. Seeing this video of re-entry from outside of the craft is something I never expected I’d ever witness. It begs the question, what comes next?
Did anybody else notice the debrie dissappear into the body in the forst 3rd part of the video? Terrible cgi
"Re-enter Earth's atmosphere" is Elon-speak for "sprinkle shredded rocket pieces over the ocean instead of soft landing"
At 1:39 you can clearly see several of the heat shields tiles  coming off the spaceship upon entry. They are indeed the tiles, I've enlarge the screen and slowed it down enough to even see the tiles shape as it flys away from craft. Why wasn't this addressed publicly?
Fascinating makes my day thanks spaceX the best
Thanks for all the comments, Grok.
Remember when NASA did all their speculation work BEFORE launching giant tanks of poisonous fire into the sky? Biggest thing in space isn't an achievement if it's harmful to the atmosphere. How much oxygen is being destroyed up in that o3 zone?
It's global warming in real time...Cool?
Best video for science so far 😊
Why do those idiots cheer and clap. So odd
Friction of the atmosphere... lol
_And those narrator puppets, explaining all the BS, is really pathetic, very low level._
Umm that was not the planned re-entry ... but spectacular pictures ...
Nice acting 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
_CGI, home office produced! Cheer Leaders Applauding and everything. Simply ridiculous._
Thank god I was nowhere near that room.
❤ 🙏🙏Blessings forever GOD loves y'all too forever tell everyone you know and don't know. Jesus loves y'all too forever. Teach everyone how to see and enjoy their blessings too forever
Watching on mute.
Leaving comment for historical record
They’ve captured our collective consciousness. 🥴😵‍💫🥸
Take a shot every time they say starship
Take a drink for every time they say the word Starship.
Had to put this on mute to enjoy it
Stunning, incredible and beautiful. Praise god for Elon and the team. You have brought us so much farther than we ever where in such a short space of time. Thank you for the video, thank you for the great minds, tireless dedication and for being Human.
Incredible achievement. Loved the commentary but please turn off all the screaming in the background..so annoying. Thank you
FakeX is so joke ...
so   did the camera lens  have tile protection
Imagine if the first moon landing coverage was also smothered with an incessant barrage of loud unnecessary verbal diarrhoea
*_YAWN. how dumb do they think we really are?_*
MAGA
Pure comedy ...i feel so bad for humans ...so fckn gullible... so sad .. Fake fake fake fake fake
Can you not slow it down
3:43  wow.... what is strange reaction... Why so.  Many times ships got exit and enter atmosphere...
Oddly, the moon placed 1969 panning camera worked better than the 2024 Space-X one, in panning the launch.
Wow!! Did it land?? How did it land??
The speed it's moving at is incredible
Can a magnetic field repal plasma heat
"You know its real because it looks so fake"  Nobody noticed something very odd about the camera work ?
Thank for posting awesome vies of starship!❤
Fake as f^ck
Who cares? You actually think that piece of junk is going to land on mars in 20 years? 😂
Wow,  more space sex bullshit for suckers
Lousy commentary.  Explain what's happening, fools!.
Low Earth orbit (often known as LEO) encompasses Earth-centred orbits with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less. Low Earth orbit is considered the area in Earth orbit near enough to Earth for convenient transportation, communication, observation, and resupply. Basically has not even left Earths orbit, so how are they re entering anything. Also why did the camera not fail, with all the so called heat.  🤔
Mankind and be just as amazing as can be atrocious! ~Thankfully :)
Lol
wow
Just keep repeating the word plasma in the comments. Tell everyone how cool the plasma is. Plasma is the key word. Where is the Van Allen Radiation belt?
Pretty cool man. Oh, btw, it's "farthest" not furthest. Farther relates to distance; further means more.
What happened to the car they sent? Wheres that at now?
Whats with the 'valley girl' gay* commentator? *for effect
With every little flake of dust, ice, metal, whatever... that comes off of every rocket / craft sent into orbit, it's amazing we aren't more like the movie Wall-e.
Good luck star ship hope you have a good landing from David at mablethope linconshire
Less talking more re-entry footage
Do nerds always sound gay?
It's the video of the year!
😮I'm impressed with the way these spokespeople understand and are able to communicate the mission of the flights.
So where are the flerfs “debunking” this?
these people are a cult
Barron Asset fund.
What will the flat earthers say?
クラウンが最期に見た光景かな？
@Stanley_Kubrick&2001: we have a problem...
Why does it feel like, all that entry heating is bullshit. I am little sceptical about everything that concerns space. Seems like it's the area where all the lies have become useful to those who abuse ppl with the excuse of protection, over the long term. Selling lies most be the most profitable business after all.
Hyperbole as usual. Thanks for wasting my time.
Co2/Methane turned Planet Venus into a 900 degree environment 24/7 and 365 ? Methane turned our Sun into a Blurry Orange Blob! Wake up!
AQUATIC LIFE OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA? ARE DYING RIGHT NOW! CHEMICALS FROM ROCKETS BEING CAST OFF IN OUR OCEAN! WAKE UP!
NO MATTER WHERE HUMANITY MAY GO?? WE WILL DESTROY IT BECAUSE WE ARE A VIRUS TO LIFE! WE COULDN'T EVEN RESPECT OUR HOME!
Guys, there’s a lot of stuff flying off might wanna check that out
What's amazing is this starship is inches shy of 30 feet in diameter.  Walk off thirty feet in your home.  Amazing
Fake!
I can't believe nobody has a mask on this is nuts
Greatest footage of reentry ever recorded. It’s so beautiful
Ahhhh and hmmmm are not words and have no place in an announcer's vocabulary.
The woman and the gay guy covered the story pretty good....thumbs up
So what was all that crap that seemed to be falling from the ship at the beginning of the video?
I can see the appeal to buying a Tesla. Elon is definitely changing the world.
Oh dear sheeple 😂
3 for 3 another elon musk space failure... thank goodness his hyperloop monorail train thingy worked out so well for elon.
FAKE
WOW, I wonder if those 18,000 heat shield tiles are reusable. This is absolutely amazing and so revolutionary.
This iss very nice.  70 years ago,, we had problems transmitting dataover phone lines.  "We have come along waay Baby!!"
The Earth is Curved, sorry flat-Earthers! 😸🤡
The narrator voice has a lot testosterone in it.
Although NASA has tried somewhat to modernize its processes it still largely operates on the Cold War Era model of space flight research.  Back then every launch or test was a status opportunity vs the USSR.  Any kind of failure was seen as a major setback and an embarrasment  Flights were YEARS apart as NASA tried to fix every problem on the ground.  Once America had beaten the Soviet Union to the moon, the interest in space by the government largely fizzled and the program ramped down to a much lower level.    Space X is not about marketing a national ideology or competetion betwen nations , its about creating cheap and reliable space vehicles and lowering the cost of all things space related.  At this Space X is succeeding at an incredible rate, even if it has a hard time satisfying the expectations of current generations who grew up watching Star Wars and seeing warp drives and instantaneous space travel
it feels like the spin was hard to control for a lot of the early reentry process.  maybe the attitude jets need to be beefed up a bit and used for longer than originally thought.  oh well at the rate SpaceX is improving the system they will nail all the issues
so the plasma effect showed up at about 100km altitude but the ship gained a bit of speed until around 83 km when it began to tick down a bit and then around 73 km the kmph started rolling off.  I wonder how this lined up with Space Xs model for re entry
Amazing footage. How do flat earthers reconcile that obvious arc I wonder?
Add my favorite teack, the Space Shuttle burnup mix, Boston's Cool The Engines
Other than the inane chatter, that was mind blowing.
Yawn!
Wearing an omega speedmaster moon watch. Nice
Great job camera!
The operation was a success but the patient died.
Does it exploded? or landed ?
SpaceX is making NASA look like toyRUs. SpaceX technologies is so freaking cool!
Hey guys i have a question, is there air available, like in 80KM ore above? If not, i am trying to understand how the fire while re-entering the earth was possible to happen? If there is no air, no fire and heat possible. I understand, like how then rockets fly? They have oxygen tanks and so the engines can ignite the fuel etc. I am just asking, not saying anything, like today if you sak a simple question, they call you all names, like flat earther, conspiracy guy or what ever. I hope i will get here some serious answers. Thank you ;)
It’s so gross the laugh track space X uses over and over again.
Did the Sattilite ejection door close? Another commenter said it didn't.
Why do people think the earth is flat? Because no matter what, they always cut the footage to the people watching, so it leaves room for doubt 😂   In future, just stick to showing the camera on the rocket. I don’t want to see anyone on the ground, do a split screen… because I am sick of listening to flat earthers 😂 every time you cut the footage to something else they run with it saying stuff like “See, they won’t show the truth”… And while I disagree with them 100%, you ain’t helping by cutting the footage… show it from start to finish so we can shut them up 😂
Could be a hoax video
So if we can see live re-entry footage we should be able to see any UAP/UFO activity! 👽
Similar 1971 footage. Apollo 15. https://youtu.be/_TTqgLZ-0bU?si=WSOtqqkVoLXBJIsU
🙏👊
Simply marvelous! I use to pray I would be alive for the Jetson’s day! I MADE IT! Hahahahahah I am 67 and long to go……so exciting….BRAVO!!!
It's amazing !!!
Spoiler alert. It didn't make it.  This is absolutely incredible
So what happened with the vehicle? Judging by the way the attitude icon was flipping back and forth as the telemetry began to degrade I wonder if it didn't didn't break apart finally.
Elon is the man!
Slowly and surely
Love this but please can we keep the morons cheering out of the broadcast?
I hope Elon musk gets bankrupt and all his stupid projects fail. This guy is the most dangerous as***hole in the world.
That thing is MOVING
Concrats space x Team that a milestone in human history.
Bahahahaha! That was so fake.
Can we please left a more masculine man do the narration instead of someone who sounds like they watch the oscars ?  America needs some toxic masculinity to balance out all these low testosterone men
Lmao a 1000times!
WOW! COOL! And hot
and in my country, people from the majority religion are still debating and fighting and creating chaos because of religion stuff. they even managed to pull some shit into politics as well.
I lost
What would happen if you made starship spin (like a rifle bullet) on re-entry
They lost the spaceship, this is fake
Elon Musk and SpaceX seem so confident and competent. Have the previous failures been planned by SpaceX to milk more money from NASA and the United States government?
Utter bs
Why not just cover the entire craft with heat tiles?
Increíble speaceX thank you for showing this to me I’ll show my son 👦🏻 and thank you for keeping beautiful, smart, strong looking real woman in position, what I’ve seen in other factories if you look like a real man or woman they won’t hire you so thank you Elon keep up the good work
❤❤❤ wow amazing... thank you for sharing this video
Think;   Small propellant nozzles with heaters so they don't freeze.
What were the white dots that passed the craft briefly
Hahaha this is all fake it’s funny to see so much idiotss here…the distortion is so fake and obvious as well
Incredible!
Total BS. Wake up sheeple. This is fake. Just like all NASA missions. Nothing can go above 100 miles above the earth. It’s called the firmament.
How is it that NASA kept talking to the astronauts with Apollo but today with way better technology we lose  communication, liars! Liars i say!!
Fantastic, great job, everyone. Thank you Elon Musk!!
Amazing CGI
My camera broke after falling out of my pocket, laying on my back. This one can survive re-entry? Amazing.
What accent is that he has?
LOL. 2600F camera's just fine. LOLOLOL
Flat earthers dont like this video lol
Fake just mushroom food
What a horrible voice makes me sick in my mouth
Si explodeaza.😅😅😅😅😅
No wonder musk can't pay his employees benefits he's got $20million fireworks 😂😂😂, what a joke 🤣🤣
What's with the rent a crowd 🤔
oh man! it is cool! ❤
Hi Guys, this was amazing. One question I have is as Starship was decending before re-entry hit there seemed to be lots of small debris coming off it or flying past it? what was that please?
What’s all that stuff falling off
No Space! Soon you will get the Real Show!
So the thing disintegrated during reentry ? It's not very clear and from my observations there is no real guarantee that the thing will flip on it's belly which is the only protected area.
Those rocket nerds are very excitable
This is exactly why Hollyweird indoctrinates you fools with so many Sci-fi movies…so you’ll believe horse shit like this. There are plenty of videos of people’s rockets, and high altitude balloons hitting the firmament, and not once do they burn up in a flood of plasma 🤔 Those of you cheering this video on, are the same people who believe the moon landing was real. Anyone with half a brain, and some common sense can see this crap, along with anything to do with NASA, is all smoke and mirrors.
Love how many times they used the word flaps
Why does it show starship slowly accelerating if engines aren't on ?
Whats all that stuff floating/falling around ? 1:34
The diversity hire threw me off
It's cool and all, sounded like an Ohio State Football game being played in a Buffalo Wild Wings. I turned the volume Off.
I'm 60 years old. I remember watching Apollo missions. I can't believe all these years later we're cheering and getting excited about this? What? Back then we would say things like, "Imagine 50 years from now, dude!" And here we are 50 years later and we made no advancement. We went backwards.
Awesome
Well done Elon & Team. Fkkin EPIC!
Yeahhhhh thanks elon now we have starship debri  in both side of the planet great job musk and minions
I know re-entry and landing of starship will be the biggest challenge of space X
Incredible video but did it all work out?
Starship: fuck the temperatures, we goin sideways baby
What type of “data” are they collecting?  Who cares? This is all fake space pantomime for ignorant people.
Object is coming from earth at 3:57 on the right side of this video. Will they tell us at least they  did see it ?
Hurrah 🎉
Wow. SpaceX and Starlink providing exciting videos of Starships re-entry videos. Truly amazing. Chao. Keep Going!
Seeing the flat Earth was so amazing
1:55 are these space debris or starship parts?
100km->74km khoảnh khắc quan trọng
Ok Elon great Job you all , now... ( its no debris ) take a look at min. 3:57 of this video and you will see an object flying up extremely  fast . What is it. ?
and you want people to go up in this?  haha
It’s all CGI !
fake fake, we all know space is fake
So.....your excited  because,  of rentery, something  we've  been doing from the 60s.....
Hmmmmmm..?
Wooo fly that ship like you stole it ai ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Put some bass in your voice! 😂
What was all the debris just before hitting the plasma wave?
Are those barium type disks?
Cartoon shit 💩
Space is fake ...as fake as this vid!!
nice but totally outdated / museum toys 🧸
What are we listening to with the background cheering?  They should narrate - obviously there's pivotal points that us 99% of non aerospace  engineers watching this don't have readily apparent.
Giant waste of money. What is the useful application for us, with out tax-dollars?
I can stop watching that initial glow 🥲
Omg I was in love with her voice then saw her and fell in love again. ❤
The proof is all there!! It really is flat as a board....
🍑💨💨💨💨💨
Green screen BS
Just incredible CGI. It's very impressive.
Never, never going to get tired of this recovery process.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wanna know what all them pieces of debris were
Looking forward to the day when every single person on Earth finally realise that " we cannot leave this Earth, it is a closed system" !!!!!   All these videos are just deceiving the public and showing just how "clever" they are with CGI ! Wake up people!
Gentlemen, we’re going to Mars.
Imagine if she kept her mouth shut.
foxtrot, alpha, golf host ruined this whole video!
I am in shock, awe, I don't know. What a sight!
0 for 3, your tax dollars at work everybody!
I hate all the cheering morons and Elon kiss ass yes men. Nasa have literally done this thousands of times already. Looks great but yeah 🤷‍♂️
so what happend to spaceship finally , did it came back to earth or its still orbiting ?
Space X needs a Rob Navias sounding announcer!
Would have been an achievement if they still had control, because it was completely out of control at that point, basically just watching a chunk of metal falling back into earth's atmosphere and burning up
Lol it melted in an uncontrolled re-entry yay. What the hell anyway. Where can I buy a ticket?
Por que não mostram as margens da terra e nem as estrelas , será que ninguém se pergunta onde vão parar as estrelas
Why is the earth moving the way it is?
My Jaw just dropped. i want to cry. i only see this in movies
Wow,  heat shield tile just like the Space Shuttle.  By the way, they do work!!
Is there no RCS? Why was it spinning like that? The RCS shouldve basically stabilized it in prograde flight. Im just curious. Does anybody know if they lost the RCS systems mid flight?
Appears to be the start of another rapid disassembly!!!
That was super exciting🤗
I want to see the first HUMAN MOON landing LIVE!!! Now we finaly have the technology to REALLY go to the moon and send LIVE FEED.
Should have a camera inside the tanker, to see what happening with fuel at 0 g and descending, or need some redesign of the tanker.
crowd noises sound fake also
Our SpaceX Starship IFT-3 Mission Launch Reaction:   https://youtu.be/HyQxPLoKm2Q
*I like how you see multiple ufo's fly by, and they act like it wasn't even noticed lol*
Looks like those flaps won't be any use at those high altitudes and by the time there is enough atmosphere to push against the first stage will already be spinning too much out of control.
Beautiful view of earth curve on the horizon!   (flatters stay away, it was not a fish-eye lense)
5:45 i don't think i've heard such dissapointment in my life lmao
Camera man never dies.
Is it flying with 26,000 km/h and takes 1 km in 6 second ish?
Any safety concern landing back on earth?
60years after, we stay playing with rockets. stars you say!
i'm surprise it didn't explode in true tesla and elon fashion.
SPACE X has recieved over 17 BILLION DOLLARS since 2003 ELON LOVES FREE MONEY $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
seems to me like instead of using those tiles they should use the foil that they used on Apollo 11. The lunar module was a huge hit for having no issues returning safely to earth. That foil looks like it took the heat and the atmospheric pressure no problem. Where is 1969 when you need it?! All that technology destroyed 🤔😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Well done guys...
WOW that view of earth and the sun was incredible, we need more HD views of space, its mesmerising, well done SpaceX 👏🏼
One thing that this video CLEARLY shows is that the way SpaceX attached the thermal tiles to the surface of Starship was a MAJOR failure. You can see individual tiles starting to fall away from the vehicle at about the 1:10 mark of the video. At about the 1:40 mark, you see large amounts of tiles flying off the vehicle. And you can heard people in the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne reacting to the number of tiles falling off. About 15-20 seconds later, you hear the SpaceX commentators pause in mid-sentence when they realized what was happening.  This will probably be the biggest issue the FAA has ever had with Starship and will be a major concern with NASA, also. I predict that  ITF #4 won't happen until at least 6 months from now, perhars maybe a year, even.
Dave says "Cool"!
In my part of the country people won't accept you if you pronounce that way.
This is so magnificent my skin just got goosebumps seeing our world from the outside of it and entering back to earth. Just mind blowing that we are piece of huge system where we float but here we feel safe touching the ground :D
all fake BS
Leaving my comment here in this historical day! Such a nice view from the camera, I'll show this to my grandchildren
Get some real men to commentate instead of ……….? Remember Apollo era. 54321. Not a teeth show
Notice how this definitely proves the earth is flat. ;-)
In the words of the great Hawk Harrelson "He Gone".
Was Starship turning end for end prior to re-entry??
stop whooping!
Hey i could see my house 🤣 ☝️
چی شد بلخره ترکید؟
والا ما که نفهمیدیم بلخره هر کدوم چی شدن همه کف میزنن ولی تهش رو نشون ندادن
Sssss, sssssss, sssss ss sss ssss
This a all fake, don’t believe what you see
So what next starship got fried?
crazy to see how plasma forms real-time on an object re-entry and not in a game like KSP..... amazing
Those heat shields are AMAZING
Remember to recycle y’all! 😵‍💫😵‍💫
That was exciting stuff.
Since the beginning was clear the "ship" was inside. Not a reentry
This should be a commercial for the camera! I wanna know what kind of camera that is!
It's guaranteed to re-enter the atmosphere. It never left the atmosphere, lol. It was spinning out of control and leaked a huge amount of Oxygen. Then crashed into the Ocean. A total failure. But the pictures were nice hahahahaha
not bad for first attempt good work NASA the red glow on that bad boy dam that was really hot
Congratulations Space X, well done.
Mindboggling .... hits hard emotionally to see the level of engineering and sciences behind to deal with the extreme stress factors and do proper computer calculations for a controlled tumbling. Unbelievable if not seen with own eyes. Congrats to all who had been involved to make this outstanding project working.
Living in incredible times,
“Re-enter”?!  lol, that’s a generous description if there ever was one.  Another “successful“ disaster.
It’s absolutely incredible what Spacex is achieving! Amazing!
Just imagine how awesome this would be with DEI...women, people of color, BIPOC heros running the show! One day...😂😂
FAKE CGI!!  The Earth IS NOT round!!
🧚‍♂️
Woo that’s great 🎉🎉 but it get lost in Indian Ocean (signal lost) while re-entry to earth . Haven’t recovered yet.
Romans 10:9-11  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
1.2 ETH to 2.4 ETH per day - ez
Hmm earth doesn't look very flat from that altitude.
This is so fascinating!
🥲
I don't understand why they keep quoting off the script. These are highly skilled, intelligent aerospace engineers. It's clear from the video when the ship is upside down, or flying ass first.. but they keep going on about the heat shield.  And, they didn't even mention all the shit flying off of it at the beginning of atmospheric interface.  Also, according to the telemetry, this was happening... wayyyy up there, above 100 km... where there shouldn't be enough air to do any of this.  I mean, this was obvious to anyone with the knowledge base they possess... why aren't they reporting it?
Sounds like a Star Wars reveal.
Makes me think, how the heck the Space Shuttles got down to earth?
如败
Great content. But... this is not Entertainment Tonight. This is a scientific mission. You don't have to make it into pure entertainment. Also, your girl needs to learn how to talk without saying "UMM" every fifth word.
Weird that the guys faking all this Space stuff would even render in the mistakes....       /s
What am i looking at😂😂😂
This is what I hate most about Americans, all that premature whooping and shouting. This thing burned up on re-entry it was yet another spacex failure but all you hear are these ridiculous screams and shouting for no reason. Why can't they keep all that noise for when the things lands back on the earth and is a success?  Its so cringeworthy listening to it when this was an obvious failure. 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄
They needed to say 'Starlink' more often.
How is this not #1 on trending
WHY IS THIS NOT ON MAINSTREAM MEDIA!! WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS!
Hey Beavis, they said flaps huh huh huh
Ни одна из ступеней не вернулась  и сгорела, но тестовый полëт прошëл успешно!!! Только американцы так умеют😂!
Leave it to SpaceX to make revolutionary advances in plasma displays!
1:53 ish, why is the debris going the wrong way?? Edit: also at 2:10
What a view..wow
Whenever they have women speakers they're always so annoying aaaah. Aaaah aaaah they all sound like diversity hires
Love Netflix Series...😂😂😂😂😂
Truly next gen graphics.
Plasma field then unfortunate break up of the Starship..
Congrats SpaceX. I hope they managed to gain valuable data during the reentry part since any signal is block out by the plasma.
Unreal Engine 5 is awesome!
FAKE
Your kidding right??
If the cartel ever duplicates this tech, drug running is going to be impossible to detur. . . . Anyway I'll feint if I ever see a billionaire do something useful for a change. . .
Why isn’t the altitude decreasing more consistently with the speed?
❤👋
No one can tell this is CGI???!?!?!
Space penus crashed again what a turd!😊
Is all the debris normal?
It got the Angle wrong. I think they need 16 RCS trushtors to correct the angle and maintain that angle....
I built a table today
It seems as though the altimeter or the speedometer is broken.
Man the things they can make look so real through computer animation is amazing🙃. Truely as mind blowing as the heat shields😂
if this were truly in space the debris would never fall down or be pulled down by all the ferrum (IRON/STEEL) on earth  you would not need any speed, energy, etc traveling in weightless space. the friction or flames we see is excess static electricity because this vessel is under the dome
Looked like it was unstable and failed to align/keep the tiles aligned with the airstream/heat…
They never could get that thing under control.  Flaps just flailing back and forth.... yikes.  If you look at the construction of those tiles, they really haven't been able to replicate the quality of what was made 50 years ago.
Is this fake?
I wonder what type of heat shielding they implemented during the Apollo missions....🤔
Notice that big thunderstorm down below at 1:01?
This is incredible! We've never seen space video footage like this before back in the 80s and 90s.
i miss pubg so much, these are by far my favorite streams with you and viss
4:01 what was that thing that flew towards our pov
It was a Failure people, there is no arguing this point!  You are being fed lies online but trust when I say Elon is having to answer to some very disappointed people at this very moment.  By the way, Elon was curiously absent at this launch, wonder why that is if it was such a success.  Do you think if that was the case he wouldn’t be front and center taking the credit, you know he would.
Why all the noise?!  It is very distracting.
The  joy and energy expressed by the folks at Space X...!
Cadê os terraplanista kk
Woah another first from SpaceX phenomenal work all. Unbelievable. 👏🚀💪
If only it were real.
Watch out for tool bag.
Yawn...
psych!
Heat shield tiles flying off
What happened?  Did it eventually crash?  Burn up?  What?  I don't understand why it's so important to come back down so fast..  Why not slow it down first so it doesn't get so hot.
Elon Musk is one of the greatest men to have ever lived not named Jesus. 😁
The view through the debris field is awesome!!
I know the booster didn't land, but did the starship make it back safely in this video?
Super bad ass.
I can’t stop watching this. Some of the most spectacular space footage ever recorded.
While the environment and climate collapses, these billionaires are launching rockets to the moon. Let’s all help the planet earth instead.
TURN THE CAMERA THE OTHER WAY WHY DONTCHA???
The trained seals cheering are kinda of pathetic...... almost cultish.   BTW Musk was said in 2017 he'd be on Mars by now.
#flatwater
Biggest flying object ever in space. Bigger than the sun even.
She's a cutie!!!
THEY ALL BLEW UP... ahahaha success
Flat earthers, your move.
Where the flat earthers at ?? 😂 So beautiful. And so obviously curved.
We need more testosterone in the narration like the apollo era.
So did it survive re-entry and land or burn up or crash or what???
Soon we will be able to spread DEMOCRACY across the stars.
Mute
it's great to see people delighted and clapping because they saw the plasma, or maybe they were paid to do it. NASA vehicles have achieved much more than this vehicle, speed, range etc
i bety they were doing test to see what stress points they could find on these vehicles
I wish I could see the entire reentry, though... Until the ground.
Film of Apollo on Moon, none of re-entry.
Is that the heat tiles Fallin off
Wow!!! Impressive job dodging those satellites!!! Whoo hoo!
Fake bullshet
Seen better graphics in Hell Divers 2
Fake
Amazing how the camera can still project images with all of that plasma
1:15 Lake Anony🙂
There would be not enough money for me to enter this Musk tube working as pre funeral coffin
From what I understood, this footage proves that the Americans reached the capabilities to make hypersonic missiles actually maneuverable and actually work ad intended. This was more so a message to America's enemies than anything else
Between 2 and 4 minutes is the best part. Looks beautifull
Acum am înțeles de unde vine lumina pe pământ lumina Duhului   sfint mulțumesc  va iubesc
Felicitări Spacex
Plasma was beautiful ❤️
When my kerbal crafts flip around like this on re-entry, it's usually because the weight is off-balance and the heavy engines are wanting to go down first.
2:45 the absolute flat earth  ;)
disintegration
I hope everybody remembers how phony this all is forever. Rockets don't fly backwards. So sorry the law of physics has to ruin your day. Get an education.
KSP ass re-entry though.
star ship needs to do re entery like falcon does I think that would be a plus and then flop or land like falcon tail first all the way down half to put on grid fins in place of the fins on the nose but worth it.
fake as F
This puts the apollo rocket to shame. This starship will put us into the 21st century, its beautiful.
what a historical moment and a giant leap for mankind
So much tax money being wasted
Not much control kinda fell out the sky like a rock
My hair is standing…absolutely chillingly awesome
wow kerbal space program is looking quite realistic these days
More space videos, less politics is what the world needs… thanks for making the internet a better place! 🙏
5:00
Did it land or not?
Martian Chronicles not too far off (except the Fall of the House of Usher II has already begun for real on earth.)  Ray Bradbury would be amazed.
Damn it, the producers forgot to add more stars in space as always. Atleast they put some. Notice the local sun concentration. And how the sun is not shown as its is local as well.
Re enter nothing. That thing was still in atmosphere. You cannot escape the atmosphere.
keep rotating. that might be the reason of getting lost
Really annoying crowd
Wow comic book plasma
Good job & good time
To God be the Glory in Jesus name 🙏
I'm VERY upset about the lack of diverse representation in the control room.
doesn't show shit.
I am no scientist or engineer but it would be great if they could somehow use that plasma buildup to help with re-entry, a lot of energy there! Just a thought from a laymen!
What sre the things flying off, ice or tiles?
& failed again....bring back the SATURN V.....100% success rate.
Is this a joke.  Yet in the 60's we flew to the moon, deployed rh landong module with 3 men who the plated a flag, played golf and took home movies before relaunching the lander to dock with the orbiter module (that had been orbiting the moon the whole time), then flew back through the VanAllen radiation belt unscathed all to have a big parade.  So how is this "starship" thst hasn't even left esrth's atmosphere a big deal55 years later? 😮
I get sad sometimes I won’t be able to see the end result of this but I’m so LUCKY to be alive to witness the beginning. Congratulations space x 🚀
22 years ago, Elon Musk founded SpaceX. Now he has basically organised the building of the largest, most powerful rocket ever, that will, in all likelihood, be the first vehicle to carry humans to another planet. This is just one of his monumental achievements. Anyone that hates on Musk has a screw loose. He's one in a billion.
Perfect Machine. Perfect work in the world Perfect team in the world Perfect Mission. Thank you very much 150324.
that sound of ppl cheering is the same everytime, i skipped to the moments they cheered and it sounds the same, allready a red flag for me
It looks so fake,  it's not even funny
Elon Musk is indeed a National Treasure!!  A generation of govt bureaucracy called NASA with unlimited taxpayers money could never get us anywhere except earth ow orbit, until SpaceX came along
Re entry survival for such barrel configured ship seems llbe solid obstacle of the whole project...
At about 4:50 in
Did anyone notice the actuator arm between the body and flap melt away? The flap folded and stayed in place
why did they cut out before it crashed?
4:39 "The heat shield tiles doing their work"  Literally not a single heat shield tile is doing its job at that moment - the spacecraft is flying ass end first and the plasma is chewing up the engines.
How convenient that the ship was lost on "re-entry"... I am sure that was always the plan.
More space junk.
Cool CGI
Damnmmmm..... Elon wins again!
1965 Gemini exceeded this. 60 year old tech.
So cool. Huge success for starship. I remember being so excited by the progress in the 1960s then the way that the space program basically became a non-entity and it is great to see progress happening again in an activity I think it the next stage of the future of mankind. I cannot help but think that Elon Musk is single-handedly dragging mankind forward to fulfill the 21st century—restoring space exploration, moving to electric vehicles, connecting brains to computers and sensors to overcome damage-related losses, and other things—not to mention becoming, at great personal cost, a prime defender of the First Amendment in his spare time.
Just amazing, wonderful, wait what going on🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👍👍👍👍👍✨✨✨
Geek alert
Very interesting. Kudos to the SpaceX folks who made this happen. From the graphics shown, the spaceship's orientation is constantly changing from vertical (butt first) to vertical (nose first) on reentry which I suppose is to spread the heat throughout the body of the ship and not expose any one side too long to the heat of reentry. This makes sense (sort of like rotating your car tires) for both thermal and wear reasons. I bet it rotates as well for the same reasons but not shown in the graphics accompanying this video. Again congratulations...we've come along way since NASA had a monopoly on space - at true testament to private versus government successes.
Spacey
Where are all my flat Earth rejects? Crickets!
This is nothing.  In my day we put a man on the moon.  Or so they say.  And had pictures to prove it.
SpaceX is showing us what a fraud NASA is. Look at how the private sector is absolutely embarrassing our government when it comes to the progress they make on a fraction of the budget. And the transparency is amazing.  Just what the heck has NASA been doing with all of our tax money for all these years!!!!
this guy has an.  absolute horrible liberal sounding voice.  Couldn't finish
Too bad Elon was not around  in the 1960"s - we might have actually made it to the moon instead of a Hollywood studio ....hopefully Elon will always save (and not loose) the telemetry data like NASA.....wait NASA lost that too. We can land on the moon now at 54+ years ....- if you don't mind the lander falling over on  its side .
AWESOME!
الهم صل على محمد وال محمد god please u
Somebody tell that nice blondie lady.    It's FARthest not FURthest.
Did it landed?
The rocket rotates under the camera, which is firmly attached to the rocket body🤡 The delicate mechanism of the wings didn't melt🤡 Hot plasma is specially trained to stay at a distance from the camera and create analog interference in the digital camera at specific times🤣
Such nonsense
flying saucers dont do that.
Love it!  Go Elon!
Brilliant thankyou Elon X
Idiotic commentary. The atmosphere isn't doing you any favors. It merely exists, and you are using it to brake the ship instead of using a retrofiring rocket to slow it down, and how many times do you have to say, "This is the fastest and farthest Starship has ever flown"? She must be the diversity hire because they sure didn't hire her for her stirring commentary.
Lol,, Totally fake
Did they use Tesla full self-driving? 😂
Wow  Wonderful............   WHAT B.S.   We should have had people on Mars by now. Fools. Nearly 60 years later and everyone is going wow wow wow about a rocket landing back on the earth. This is what happens when they revise history.
Have we observed all of space to be able to make this claim?
The original space shuttle tiles were developed at the Admiralty Marine Research Laboratory Holton Heath UK. The was a laboratory there purley investigating the use of Aluminium Oxide.
Please get some professional commentary personal. These kids sound like high schoolers doing their first radio broadcast. Listen to any Apollo mission to hear much better commentary from... Actual men.
Encore une demi-réussite, mais quel spectacle!!!
TIME LAPS😂❤❤❤💖🥰😻😺
10/10 dream come true
😮 I was moaning and grunting as if I was taking a shit when I saw this incredible broadcast 😅
Imagine, this is easier than loving our neighbor as ourselves. This doesn’t impress me. The other would.
the constant cheering crowd is so unnecessary
They were all cheering as it was tumbling uncontrollably. Musk defenders will say that trial and error like this is just part of rocket science, I would probably agree with them if it was still the 1950s. The Saturn V NEVER failed this spectacularly while Starship has had some sort of catastrophic failure 3 times in a row now. Why are we still wasting tax money on SpaceX?
65klm and cam went out b4 it  splashed down  least we got to see it return .
It looked like it was shedding tiles even before it reentered and there was no significant speed reduction on reentry. I doubt it splashed down in one piece.
She doesn't mention that the ship is clearly oriented wrong for re-entry. Even as she's talking about the heat shield, you can clearly see on the video that the heatshield is not pointed at its path of flight. You can clearly see that the ship is not responding and is out of control very early on.
Why did the old shuttle not have these problems. ?
That debris is the ships' heat shield. Of course, she knew that as she was watching but kept up the pretense.
Love how they film the liftoff from the side of the rocket, like Nasa used to do it at the start
A qué hora se salen del cohete oigan alguien sabe 🤔
Too bad the SpaceX technology is not able to even enter orbit and reenter successfully. 1960's technolgy was better. Went to moon and back multiple times. I think our technology has gone backwards.
Is anyone inside?
Good but still confusing to ordinary people
🍿  WHY isn't anyone showing it land. 🤡
So cringy to watch a spacecraft starting entry interface out of control and the knowing its fate. Looks like SpaceX needs engineers.
I watch the launch off my boat in South texas
Look,no Fisheye Lens and Proof the Earth isn't Flat!!!
Spectacular views.
Imagine that .. we lost the signal at just the right time . Who really believes this crap is real?  The acting is bad, the science is bad, the false joy is so bad, and the cgi is getting better but too good. The fact that there’s only one camera is the dead giveaway this is all fabricated.  A rocket re- entering and landing ahahaha every academic engineer laughs at this and knows it’s impossible .   But pleas explain in this day and age, why only one camera? If this was legit these people would be so freaking proud of this that they would have cameras covering the entire rocket in a 360 degree view.  67 million dollar launch, idk how many million dollar rocket ,  180 billion dollar valued company , and one GoPro 4 duct taped  to a fin. Real believe guys. You’re lucky most of the people are under mass hypnosis mind control and have fallen under your spell.  Seriously , you have your mascot the actor and fake billionaire boss and he can’t even spring for an insta-360? SMH wake up people don’t be so naive.
1:45 Awful lot of debris in space
Send the screaming crowd for athenext (un)sucessful test.
Orbital mechanics at it's best
Most amazing video I've ever seen.  Too bad the craft wasn't recoverable.
another bad quality fake ....
We (humans) are amazing
Space shuttle lockheed martin TPS !
Yeah, TPS !!
Is it really necessary to broadcast from the middle of a noisy crowd?  It isn't, if it's important to SpaceX that the public actually be able to hear the commentators.  Give us a break, work from a proper booth next time with a little bit of sound isolation so we don't have to listen through the cheering crowd (we know they are there, you don't have to prove it). The girl is beautiful, but not a natural in front of the camera (too many "...ahh" s is a giveaway), in fact neither of them are a natural for the camera.  Find some professional broadcasters, please!  Although I know it isn't true, they come across as a couple of unknowing teenagers making stuff up as they go along.  It isn't necessary to use engineers as talking heads (if they are engineers); I've found that engineers are also terrible at writing (especially, tech manuals) about the things that they work on or even create.  Please get people in front of the camera that have some idea how to communicate intelligently and naturally-- these two are terrible at it and talk a lot without saying anything of note or interest.  But I'm sure there *are* people there that could.  SpaceX is an incredible company and doing incredible things!  Please find the right people to help us (the public) follow along.  It makes a real difference.
Yeah
Just unbelievable!!!
LOL at all the *MINDLESS* little space travel deniers here  :)  .
If NASA wasted as much money losing spacecraft the way ApartheidElno does, they'd have been shut down 60 years ago. Should have just given the money to NASA instead of these pretenders.
The NASA Apollo missions 11,12,14,15,16 and 17 landed on the moon 12 American Astronauts, that walked around setting up experiments,  at least one experimental station is still sending data back to earth today, they drove a lunar vehicle several miles out and back from their lunar lander and they returned safely back to earth...50 years ago, what's the problem now?  I mean really? That's what "Success" means.
What if... Starship has Roll gyroscopes? that might help with re-entry. We're only seeing Pitch data.
Большие игрушки Маска....
Seeing the Plasma is freakin the coolest!! 😮😍
lol “ you know  real cause it looks so fake”
cmon level headed sane adults...this is ridiculous...its nasas fantasy invention now being used by other agencies...research flat earth..break free from this CGI rubbish.
Amazing😮...from 🇧🇷🌎Brazil...,👍🌎☑️
Just fantastic
A great camera angle and lots of cheering doesn't make for a successful space mission. But it sure smacks of sensationalism. At some point you have to ask yourself,  "How many of these things have to blow up before it becomes  safe enough to go to the moon? Not to mention Mars?"
Elon Musk: "You knows its real, because it looks fake!"
Awesome to see how far along Starship has come... Have been watching since the very beginning.
WOW!!! I'm so glad that at 56 yrs old, I get to see something like this!! It is very cool and so exciting to see American ingenuity in the private sector doing such great things and also Seeing civilians going into space recently. I thought I wouldn't see that possibility in my lifetime. When I'm old and look back on the things i have seen in my lifetime, these new technologies in the private sector will definitely be a high point! I'm looking forward to America going back to the moon and first to Mars🇺🇲🇺🇲
Amazing!🤯👍😄
Awesome! That's insane!
We’re witnessing science fiction become reality
Do we really need to hear all the cheering , can't hear the commentary
why destroying such amazing video with those pathetic screamers losers?
Flaps ?😂
Flat earth supporters 😅
People will believe anything.
Oh good I'm glad it landed
We can see very much space debris orbiting
Clearly something hit it.. 🤔 Notice the jaring of the ship just before we see tiles come off..
Awful cheering. I prefer Nasa.
Did they use a GoPro or an iPhone on a stick?
I'm thinking of gathering some of those hexagonal panels to form my very own heat shield, I bet firefighters could make use of them as well
In hindsight they definitely lost control early on, you can see it tumbling and losing heat shield tiles. They're laughing about it because they knew it wasn't going to make it.
Pretty spectacular for a failure. Could've done without all the idiotic cheering. I don't get why they don't design it more carefully so it actually works but hey it's not my money.
Did it explode?
The same way that an asteroid "Re-enters the atmosphere".
Was it losing hear-proof armors when entering into air ?
i love flat earth.
3:27 ffs youtube wtf!
There is so much wrong with this video. You can see half the tiles fly off the rocket.  Second, why is it flying around like that? Its constantly twisting around in loops, always changing its angle, and it shouldn't be doing this. Also, they want to know what the plasma field will look like around the ship?  They have been doing accurate simulations with that since the 1950's, its how we got the design of the first generation of capsules. Granted this was great to see, but as an engineer, none of the things they are saying or doing makes since.
Absolutely amazing!!!
I like this
Dame look at all those UFO
I wish Walter Conkrite was still alive to narrate this!  Amazing, but yet, little coverage from the Elon haters.
Bit of a coincidence that the plasma started at 3:14 pi time?
*farthest and *farther. “Furthest”  and “further” refer to figurative distances.
One of the coolest views I've ever seen!
This is a continuing disaster looking for a place to happen IMHO!!
They ALWAYS burn up they're fireworks for goodness sake!
THEATRE paid audience
Amazing to watch real video of space
Huge camera distortion. But its ok
The "starship"  where it it go And with whom or what inside it???  This is the booster coming back..😮
Did it survive?
Damn how'd it get through the dome without cracking it??
That's a big machine to bring back from orbit.  I'm confident they'll stick the landing on the next attempt.
Totally awesome!!  I was one of many watching this feed live!!  What a time to be alive!!  ;)
So, with the live pictures of the curvature of the Earth, I’d love to hear how a flat Earther explains that.
This PR lady got to go.  When pieces of the ship are being left behind, we need an engineer to explain what is going on, not a PR person to pretend that reality is not happening... We had enough with companies like Boeing, and we need Space X to be a different kind of leader.
killer graphics man!
So long to people who believe that the earth is flat 🚀🌍
What is zooming past them, around them, not birds for sure.
👏👏👏🚀🙏
Man, this guy was made to say, Starlink. His next favorite word to say is, Salsa
Is it possible that the logic and sensor data that controlled the FTS caused the FTS to activate during reentry, and that that is the actual reason for the loss of the vehicle during reentry…not the continually increasing atmospheric heating effect of reentry?
Thank you.
Now thats some fake ass shit C G I
The Space Shuttle Columbia saw this right before break-up.
Is the cheering real? Who are these people?
stop talking, geez
The Earth's atmosphere definitely had a breaking effect on Starship's re-entry!
👍🏼👍🏼✌🏼
But the earth is flat !!!
Most amazing video of re entry, normally this is never seen. Thank God for starlink system. I'm confused did it land?
Flatearthers: 😶
What happens to Elon and his space endeavours if Tesla goes bankrupt?
Is the stuff falling off ice?
Bullshit
Yall stop yapping, we alredy know the whole reentry thingy and the flaps
Ridiculously fake, wowwww sheeple clapping...
NOT too much extra weight?  to make robust reentry margins, cover both sides with tiles? then twice as much margin chance of successful return to earth,  lol   get the first starship down from orbit successfully  the NEW future may have arrived lol   200 tons to orbit  what payload back to earth.. is that, 200 tons down from orbit too?
Good job very impressive. 😎🇦🇺👍
Successful striping of the TPS leads to a successful RUD
And you want people to believe we landed on the moon on the very first attempt with no problems?  yeah we went to the moon… but, can’t we do it now?  In the last couple of months, how many landers have crash landings have we had?  But, they were all labeled successful landing.
Flat Earthers are so pissed.
How did they get thru the Firmament??
USA！USA！USA！
reduce the background noises.
incredible, i finally know my grandparents got to school
That was amazing. The longest, fastest flight ever.
Le prochain lancement sera le bon. 🤩🤩🤩 Vous y etes presque ! 👍
She said it was the biggest flying object ever in space. Isn't that the ISS? HOLD ON. Multi billion dollar project and you only bolted on ONE camera. ONE. amateur youtubers have more strapped to their cars.
Tumbling starship had no chance. Needs a stronger RCS system. Expect that to be fixed for the next one!
Holly Fuck! Isn't the Earth flat any longer???
Elon Musk, say no more 🚀
Way to go!!!
Meah
4:00 "The biggest flying object ever in space"   ISS: Am I a joke to you?
Looks real, so it must be real.
It looks like Starship lost proper attitude during re-entry, causing the tiles not correctly facing toward the atmosphere .. it probably burned up.
☄️💥 nice Fireworks thanks
Amazing, a private company doing what most governments (including the US) struggle to do.
Tumbling on re entry, amazed it lasted so long.
Total Disaster... You are not ready for space travel.
Do people really believe this farse?
Yahh. Well done star ship. Spinning out of control all the way to 💥
Too bad Starship is wallowing like a drunken pig!  No attitude control at all!
Looks flat plus sun looks small
Just when you think Jeb kicked the bucket on SN8, guess again!
The difference to NASA in charge is: We don't see ppl. walking the moon now....😂😂😂 on way or the other
Check out communist 'news outlets' like cnn, msnbc, cbs, nbc and others.. They hate to see SpaceX Starship progress because DEI and affirmative action recipients are not allowed to even enter SpaceX facilities. For good reason..
Bunch of wack jobs cheering a. Rocket that's going to explode because they don't know what the hell they're doing. I waste of time and money while people here on earth are dying of hunger. Meanwhile, more idiots want to send rockets into outer space. I guess the last mission of the other rocket that stuck on the moon still never got to use his cameras because it fell over like a box of rocks. Now this piece of shit blows up coming back down to earth and people cheering is on like as a football game what a bunch of fools waste of money and time😂
Are you seriously arguing that SpaceX has 'validated' the landing of Starship at subsonic speeds? Only one out of several attempts resulted in it landing and not blowing up. If SpaceX had repeated that another 50 or 100 times without failure, then you might be able to claim it had been validated.
That rotation doesn't seem nominal. Never really had control of attitude. 4:07 Around 92 km the tail end starts to point forward. I think it's slowly tumbling and never recovers.
What a joke
SHE IS HOT
It's important to note that Starship was out of control and tumbling when it reentered the atmosphere. Apparently there was a leak that caused this. It's probably the reason why we don't see too much of the reentry, it continued doing so in pieces to the ocean surface after the telemetry was lost as 65km altitude. Cool shots of an atmosphere reentry anyway.
It's a space ship not a star ship.😂😂😂
Cool video, no doubt, but I see nobody talking about the total lack of attitude control, either in space or in the atmosphere interface. Starting at 4:00 the ship is entering sideways, plasma impinging directly on the bare steel (opposite camera view) and coming over the top. By 5:00 the ship is in a fully nose down attitude despite extending the forward flaps and retracting the rear ones. The aerodynamics of control surfaces can be quite counterintuitive at hypersonic speeds. SpaceX seems to have a long way to go to get a handle on this.
Fake X
If we are to put people on starship and that is the plan , we need to develop a better system instead of tiles.. Even inspection after launch does no good for tiles as you can see on this video can fall off any time  on re-entry.  I remember reading shuttle conditions after shuttle launches and they said they saw some missing tiles here and there.,but it was not bad enough to cause an issue. Until it caught up with them with Columbia .  Heat tiles are a system that will always be on the edge of failure. I do believe starship will be successful and meet all their objectives but I also believe it will never be 100 percent safe with these tiles. With people on starship traveling we need to the risk out of space travel if that is possible.   With all the great engineers we have working at space x and nasa we should be able to come up with an alternative
🎉
haters gonna sat it's CGI
One thing I dont think people have realised here, it was on its side for some of this. Meaning the full brunt of the heat was hitting a non heat shield area. It survived a surpisingly long time all things considered
Anyone notice how thin the Ozone Layer ( Blue Sky ) is at 2.40.  Forget Global Warming it never existed. Ozone Layer ( Blue Sky ) Depletion really is the END of the World and is happening NOW.
And there are still starving children
😂fake&fake 🤥 CGI & Hollywood 😅
What happened?
If space x have the knowledge of every detail on the starship re-entry fight, it is so great for next trial🤔
I don’t have any doubt for the next 100% success😍👍🏾
Thank you for let us see the real fight for the re-entry fight of the great starship 😍🥰👌🏿👍🏾
Amazing engineering work
AMAZING ❤
👏👏👏👏 That Was AWERSOME!!!! 👏👏👏👏 What a massive difference in watching this group of young men and woman versus the 70+ NASA groups we're so used to seeing during launches and re-entries. And WOW at what StarLink can bring us! Just amazing!!
Understanding the mathematical principles which God used to create the universe has granted mankind the ability to amuse himself.
This is great! Then why didn't we get ANY video from Intuitive Designs Moon Landing? 🙄
Wow it seems that audience is watching something completely different.
It looks so fake that it must be true
The sun is much much much much much closer than #NASAlies tells you. The heat is coming from the sun and all this testing is for seeing how close they can get past the heat of the sun. All this radiation belt nonsense is all about the Sun. Gullible people. The earth is flat. Go read the bible! The government is run by Satan. You are being lied to and the worship of the beast is here now. Book of Revelation. Read it!
It reentered.. tumbling and out of control... but it reentered! Developing and testing continues. I think "fluttering" is causing some tiles to evacuate. It might be as simple as moving the attachment points closer to the edge of the tiles to help keep them in place.
Finally something in metric! NASA idiots use imperial.
Elon.  That is all.
Plasma Won! Spaceship is Done!
what a waste of money
Now to know that this wasn't a movie is just mindboggling!!! Wow!! Amazing!!!!!!!!!
People coming back to earth on this spacecraft, that will NEVER happen! Our GENERATION-BOOMERS made it happen. Better go back to our design!!!
For those that are confused, it’s the first ever up close live HD capture of plasma forming on a vehicle reentering the earth’s atmosphere. 3:25 One could even call it a historical milestone lol
wish i had bit coin. got about 50p to my name haha
What's all the bits flying off?
Very cool…I love all the loud geeks too
amazing
Brilliant video, but that woman just will not stfu!
Wow absolutely incredible
Exciting times.
Yep, there's the flat earth.
Looking forward to narration of process without annoying background sound.
BS. Absolutely BS.  This is all CGI.
Well it burned on up, but got farther than the last 2-
What is the debris we are seeing?
Rapid re-use vehicle?  Why not just tell the truth; it burned up and crashed.  Here's some data for you:  SpaceX is an absolute ShitShow.  You can't even achieve orbit so why call it a 'Starship'?  Taxpayers are getting screwed.
Remember kids: No CGI. Absolutely beautiful!
Wtf did I just watched!! A live view if plasma field!!!
😂🤡😂
Did it land?
I want a tile
Wow
How's fast is starship
Give this cameraman a cape, and a shot of badassdom on the house.   Also I’d imagine our re-entry vehicles would look like computer heat sinks.
beautifull, but a total failure.
That reentry was a failure. You can sugar coat it with the good visual, but is a failure anyway. If there were people or cargo there they would have been lost.
well that was unstable and another failure
26000 km/h and 6 seconds to make 1 km ?😅
THEY ARE THE BEST GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE SPACE EXPLORATION IN THE US...TESLA SPACEX....
Awesome.!🚀..take that Flat Earthers 🗺️
Are these commentators broadcasting from a bar?  Geezus, the background noise is ridiculous....
Reminds me of the 1960s when we went to the moon and back.  I worked for IBM in flight code verification for 4 launches through the moon landing. .   It is certainly strange to see these people's reactions to something that was accomplished successfully 50 years ago.
What a joke! Musk has you all fooled! Sure, let's just name our fails on "test." While we ruin our atmosphere with garbage from fuel/launches....
Looks extremely fake...
Fake, there should have been a comms blackout during reentry.
Sounds like it burned up on reentry around 64km up
Fascinating….   The excitement of Mission Control ( assumption on my part ) is awesome
WTH is flying off???
Musk is a conman. Wonder, who he linked up w in the US and globally to fund his scams and rob people. Funny we quit funding Nasa yet the Gov funds hom amd Nasa is still on deck. Hes goin to be one of the ones who ruin the world.
"The data is the payload."👏👏👏👏
Best video ive ever seen from space, hope we can get more views like this. This was insane
Elon should market the heat tiles for kitchen use.
spinning pattern shows that it was not in ideal position for reentring. Something went wrong. It should be in a static angle. They were trying to fix it but was not possible. No way it should survive like that.
Would have been nice to know how fast it was going, (in actual MPH) and how high it was, (in actual ft) but other than that, well done. Great achievement.
Nice CGI the camera surviving that heat tells me that this is computer generated images.   Can I get an applaud sound bite
恭喜🎉😮
Heat shield tiles don't protect it when it is flying backwards through the atmosphere. Looks to me like it was already tumbling well before generating any plasma. The 3D perspective of the cloud layers whizzing by below was pretty spellbinding though.
Amazing view !😮
WOOOOOOO!
Hope they figure out how to keep the heat shields attached to the body     When they started to renter you can see the tiles falling off. Also attitude controls didn’t seem to work all that well. Don’t think the attitude controls were mentioned to work with something that massive.  All in all lots of learning to do from this flight, which is what it was mentioned to do!  I wonder how the first stage, the launch pad survived.   All in all a very educational flight!
It appears to be shedding tiles or something else?
It blew up!!!
Damn!  Just how big is that soundstage?
Wow! Wow wow wow. Awesome
top demais
incredible!!!!
Super exciting…
Yall only put on one camera?
I love this!
This is so badass 🥹
Anyone else see that white dot traveling at an insane speed, it comes into view at 0:04 mark top center screen
Meh just ordinary rocket, nothing spectacular
Why was it tumbling so much? And what was all the stuff flying off in the beginning of the video?
Keep up the great work SpaceX
Is it though? Is it a re-entry if it blows up?  Peace/JT
I thought that I heard Dylan Mulveney talking somewhere in the background.
really wondering what happenend to starship there. it had no control authority on orientation other than the flaps, it was basically tumbling down very much uncontrolled. or was this intentional?
its mind-blowing and utterly wild to receive such HD livestream images from space. It looked so cool it should be illegal.
This was pre-StarTrek!
Crashing
3:44 - from this moment the ship was not in the best alignment. For me it looks like, the plasmastream hits the ship from sideways related to the heatshild. Does anyone see this like me?
why they fucking SCREAM AND SHOUTS LIKE MONKEYS/???? WTF IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE??????? WHERE IS THE PROFESSIONALISM???
What are all those chunks, and why are there some that don't appear to have come from this thing?
They’re gonna have to work on maintaining the proper orientation on reentry. It was all over the place.   No wonder it didn’t survive…
Amazing Video of the Plasma Field !  Congratulations !
No doubt about it, the erf is flat as a pancake.
Well done Space X !
His nasally voice ruined it. How can a man sound like that?
Just listen to these absolute fools celebrate one of the last government funded failures! Purely selfish and disgusting!
They didn’t  have to fake it, they didn’t even show it 😂
wouldn't it be better to shed some speed by pluging nose first ?
1:15.   In playtime... right side.  😮
Dang it, school prevented me from seeing this historic moment! Damn it!
Good cgi today
hysteric crowd
Awesome work.
Unfortunately loss of both the Booster and Starship in atmosphere reentry is a design problem and for the Starship it showed it was heating but it did not show a commensurate loss in velocity and so a design change or use of Rocket engines or other methods must be employed to reduce velocity and energies.
💚amazing
Go Elon..Go go Spacex..
It's been fun to watch Kate grow up doing these events. She Was like an awkward 20yr old at first. So confident now!
❤😂🎉 yeah look great
another elon flop
Listen to the SpaceX idiots in Hawthorne cheer as they blow another $100B. Morons.
Was this a successful failure?
Talk, talk, talk, you always talk right over everything every time I watch your videos. I can no longer be a part of your style of media coverage, good bye,
What's all that stuff falling off??
Did both parts crash?
Chris Pratt is helping out too.
Rockets still seem to vex Musk, he should stick to smaller ones that seem to work better. And before you at me, rocket technology is a mature technology, almost a century old. Clearing the tower, not blowing up in the atmosphere shouldn't be  icing in the cake, does anyone believe this thing is going to take anyone to the moon let alone Mars?
Now go Scan the Moon and find the Flags.
Lost both: the booster and the Starship. And the door did not open. "A huge success" :)
that thing is going at Mach 21 that's 21x the speed of sound and the camera is unbothered by it just saying
Is this Pixar or Disney?
Humans Rule!  Aliens Drool!
lots of debris coming off
congrats SpaceX Team...
⚡👽lucidog🐶…🔥🎃…🔥👻…🌪…]]⚡👽⚡
i miss popcorn 🍿
Flatearthers hate this 😂  great video ❤❤
And yet there's a group of Flat Earthers sitting around in their buddies house watching this and saying "this is all BS"
i am trying to make Solar rocket
Simply amazing, congratullations SpaceX
Was just wondering, why don't they slow down the ship in space like they do with the boosters to prevent it becoming so hot with entering the atmosphere so fast?
What a time to be alive.
My goodness I had never thought I would get to see plasma forming LIVE.
looks real to me. lol
What flat-earth people can possible say after seeing this video
Kudos for that cameraman...he is a true warrior...
Barely started re-entry.  That the Space Shuttle did this over 133 times successfully. Makes  you wonder why it was so unceremoniously  discarded, leaving us with no way to the Space Station. And dismantling the braintrust that always built over 50 years to accomplished this was not smart. Was too expensive but Mach 7  to 225 knots, landing on a runway will always be one of mankind’s great achievements.
Great video keep going you guys are great get us back to the moon and beyond
No video of the landing?
when can i order pizza from new york to berlin with this new tech, please?
did it make it?
Great footage thanks for sharing
Lost contact still moving 24,000 km/hr
The wing looks completely damaged in the begin already
Some beautiful views of Earth.
Take that Flerfers!
The attitude appears to be all over the shop.
AMERICA 🇺🇸 , Elon musk and "all" of the people that have made this possible. thank you 🙏
Interesting object that flew right by it 3:57 😮
Another failure. You guys are so deceptive you know it burned up on re entry and you don't disclose it. 3 failures probably to to Elons use of number 33 engines . Tuc tic
🙏🏾🤍🤍🤍🙏🏾God bless
Am I the only one that thinks the ship was pointing a bit backwards during reentry?   Incredible footage nonetheless.
Keep your secrets to yourselves, stop showing your heat shield to the world.
Staggering footage!
What an amazing shot they got today ,
telescope view would be cool.
Not a success, but progress at least
What a huge success holy shit! Thank you SpaceX and Elon for pushing the reality. Im excited to witness this!
Tiles peeling off at ~1:40.
👏👏👏👏I  was very excited… congrats team‼️🌟🌟🌟🌠🌠🌠
Seemed motion control over rear flaps were lost during the descent.
Lmao it went boom
Congradulations on a great lauch!!!   PRESS ON!!!  YOU GOT IT GOING ON!!
this is shit
All that tumbling is the reason the vehicle wasn't in a position to survive reentry. It's an RCS issue that I'm sure they'll correct before the next attempt.
Epic!!! 😎🙌🏾
Those hosts are intentionally clueless or clueless. They weren't telling us what is normal and what isn't.  Obviously it tumbling around while on trajectory was a big problem, I guess also the venting of the fuel we saw shortly after stage separation. The first stage and second stage were unable to relight it's engines. However it was a big success I think overall.
There is a garbage fell off.
Back to that drawing board!
woa😮
I want to believe that this is real and not animated...I hate having to be a doubting Thomas on these things... This IS truly amazing..... but uh....Too many people are getting fooled and hustled these days... I pointed out irrefutable mistakes in animations being sworn as for real aircraft carrier mishaps of russian aircraft pulling off impossible feats and was banned from any further commentary on anything this group put on the internet... and russia doesn't even HAVE an aircraft carrier in service... The only one they have is a museum with gift shops on it..... so......What proof do we actually have that this isn't fake?
For good's sake, cannot you avoid to include those wild screams? People's wild screaming we can ear at many places and occasions, but we don't need it here. Disturbing to say the least. Nice to know that they are so enthusiastic (as i am too) but... who cares to hear their wild noise?
NASA Studios 🤣🤣🤣🤫
👍🔥🍺
Should it be spinning like that ?
Ive followed Starship from the beginning years ago. It is beyond imagination. It is history making and most importantly shaping the future!!!
nice bubbels :P looool  so smove so  fantastik 25000 kmh and the bubble is (artefakt ) is slowmotion 7 sec on the screen :D i LOVE IT no clouds change the skin , the water on the ocean ist still and  great  i cant see and ship ... and i cant see any  Airplane or the nice  artefakts on the sky Named by  Chemtrails ... not a single one ... realy i love this place -   what a nice Earth ... PERFEKTand why im not wondering about the los signal after enter the earth atmosphär .. why ^^XD  back to the real  Rocket ...   so cute  and im sure sozial media explode from peoepl round over the world to see this with handys ... or maybe not a single one :/ ?  ha ha  and btw you lost the signal ... but the speed signal and the other works fine ^^ lloool
Lots of debris coming off from about 1:00 - ice and maybe some tiles, especially around 2:00?  Some clear tile damage from the start with white broken edges showing especially in the bottom left corner of the screen. I'm guessing the reentry heating wasn't distributed perfectly either, as the entry profile seemed somewhat uncontrolled. Just amazing to see that plasma build up in real-time live.
Thats ace
...beauty of space....and down below on earth very bad wars go on!!   Whats wrong with those aggressor nations??
Jeez, are they Starlink salesmen or what? They make it seem Starlink is necessary to capture data. How did Apollo survive so many years ago? <SARCASM OFF>
Those heat shield tiles would make great coasters. It'll impress the ladies in my bachelor pad. 😎
Super incredibly 😊
Fantastic those heat tiles are so important!
We had the same views from the space shuttle.......What happened after the last view ?   Disassembly  ?   Touching the sea ?   We need informations
Bodies in orbit, is what Elon Musk will achieve.
Seems they had issues with controlling the vehicle with the gas thrusters, which is likely why the engine ignition test was not done. I also see a lot of ice debris, im guessing the only source is the thrusters, which is a potential reason for controls issues.  Considering how it started re entry at a pretty bad angle and never seemed to get stabilized and properly oriented, at the start it was even nose down and sideways looks like, i think that's pretty promising for next time. If it lasted until 65km while rolling side to side and later tumbling, i think the chance of survival properly oriented is very high. The control issue is likely a fairly simple fix now that they have seen it, and thr next flight I'd expect a clean and stable re entry.
o starship conseguiu posar?
It seems to be rotating around longitudinal axis throughout the video at times, like 2:47, 3.55.....   the heat  tiles are not facing the leading direction.
Too bad that the heat shield 😞
Seemed to be venting the duration of its flight
Well done spacex
Just like Musk's credibility, it melted away.
1:05 it flew over Filipo the Cyclone.
I'm not an expert, but that rotation doesn't look right.....
I think we might really go to the moon this time.
oh really how incredibly interesting,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Great to see the tiles blowing off as it tumbled uncontrollably through the atmosphere…$1B up in smoke…another abject failure
Did it burn up?
whats with F temperatures  STOP mixing metric  with out of date scales  it deg C remember last time you mixed systems
That camera is made of old Nokia phone parts.
KSP IRL
This footage is crazy haha. What a ride!
Why do we need people blabbing over everything?
WOW that was exciting!
I wish someone would tell the two hosts that they don't need to constantly talk. When the visuals are spectacular then stay quiet.
Stop throwing SpaceX under the bus BEFORE there is any failure.  Your need to lay blame and responsibility is absurd.  As if you have had anything to do with this ...😂😅😂 Your ego is bigger than starship and 10x more fragile.
Starship broke up when hitting the thickest part of the Atmosphere at 236,000 ft trading at mach 20. This is similar to where Columbia broke up 230,000 feet at mach 23.  Starship will need a much shallower descent profile...and a far more stable reentry. Likely Starship started an uncontrolled rolled due to frozen vents
Que buen video de ingeniería y de fondo la tierra espectacular todo el contenido.
You would think that the applause could be muted.
Wow, the recurring cheering of the morons in the background is annoying. 😖
Wow Kerbal Space Program 2 really looks beautiful now ! 😅
Once this thing becomes reliable and launching often it will usher in a totally new era in spaceflight. The amount of room inside the habitable part of Starship is greater than the ISS. It took $150 billion to build what could be done with a single launch of Starship. It could do to spaceflight what the train did to the 19th century
thats a nice go pro
It sounds like Musk hired North Korea to cheer for him in the background of this video.
UH HELLO ... TUMBLING ?  Why was nobody commenting on the fact that STARSHIP WAS SLOWLY TUMBLING the entire time, including during reentry ?!  🙄
Wow… I’m in awe
*Look !! Earth is flat!*
Just barely didn't flip on it's back during that entry
As amazing that something on a suborbital trajectory actually reentered the atmosphere... Is it really supposed to be spinning out of control like that when it does so?
More fish eye cameras and CGI backgrounds. Space exploration is being faked.
I was watching this live on SpaceX's [Twitter] feed, as well as on Tim Dodd's _Everyday Astronaut_ channel here on YouTube.   The video of the REENTRY HEATING was ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING!
That starship was moving faster than the fastest ferrari in the world. The cameras that captured those shot at such speed are crazy. Congratulations to all the Spacex family. ❤❤❤❤💪
Cant wait to see the US press badmouth these successes.
Are we watching the forward or aft end in this video?
So as long as they don't land it, it is perfectly safe...
Amazing view
They have got to figure out what is causing the roll!  Not going to be good if they can't figure that out!
garbage
This is the stuff that will eventually bring your demise. Go ahead hardheads 💰 🤑 💸 💲
Can't get enough excitement.... Only one question now: when IFT 4???!!!
It sure would have been a lot more enjoyable if these assclowns didn't constantly talk through the whole thing.
21.5 mach at 65km - starship was simply vaporized. This was a steep ballistic reentry which starship is not designed for. The flight itself though was highly impressive but it only resembles Apollo 4 flight - first orbital flight of Saturn V. The third flight of Saturn flight was her first manned flight - Apollo 8. There is no way starship will be manned rated within few flights. They will get there  but they will not be ready in time for Artemis 3.
This is incredible!! AMAZING!!
congratulations to the entire SpaceX team and especially to Elon Musk!!
Holy shit
From watching the motion of the ship relative to the earth, It looks like the ship lost attitude control. That's a recipe for failure and destruction. Another vid showed that the payload bay door would not close, and that's another nail in the coffin.
hey!... I've seen the limits of the flat earth. Obviously the curvature is lens effect and some CGI. We are being deceived by plots and conspiracies since the time of Copernicus.
Spacex should have sent a ship to the Indian Ocean with a tracking camera...or maybe they did but didn't to show the public....
The power of the flap's actuators is insane. They are able to push against the force of the atmosphere at such velocities
What a waste of Resources
Absolutely mind blowing - truly historic - next job - please educate ignorant news services about what a test flight means.
Nice CGI.
SpaceX get a real sounding MAN to commentate that guy sounds like a twink. REPULSIVE.
Star ship was rolling and/or tumbling slowly for just about the entire time it was in space.  It seemed obvious that once it began reentry it would break up.
The cheering needs to be cut out. Gayeeeeee!
Unfortunately seemed like they had a stuck thruster or venting issue preventing controlled entry.
Accomplishments  SpaceX: Lost count  Flat Earthers: Still working on it
Lots of tiles falling off. Doesnt suprise me it didnt make it thru re entry. They need to work on their heat shield.
I agree flaps are incredibly important
how is it that during the re-entry, while the ship is smashing into the atmosphere to the point of plasma formation, the speed is still increasing?
It blowd up
Drafts vs Wakes
Incredible!!
Idk who needs to hear this, or who's reading this, but if you didn't understood what happened, the rocket went BOOM.
Spinning out of control.  I can hear the interstellar music playing up and Cooper needing to stop the out of control spin before they hit atmosphere... the heat shield is only one one side of the Starship. .  then seeing the plasma of reentry moving around the ship.... well burning up the unshielded side.
Musk said. "You can tell it's real because it looks so fake, honestly. We'd have way better CGI if it was fake
Looks like it didn't make it back. Good that it made it further than previous launches but still work to do.
UAP @ 3:57  My second catch....
So everyone can see in real time what just few of us knew, by integrating some hydrodynamic equations. Great democratisation of Science, brought to you from the high technology behind Starlink communication systems. Thank you for the video! Greetings, Anthony
Its funny the whole world has to change what they're doing so these guys can keep direct injecting the atmosphere with carbon emissions😳😂😂 smh. I guess climate change has nothing to do with rockets and jet fuel, lol.
Phenomenal how beautiful the earth looks from up above.  Congrats to all involved.  Much future success for SpaceX4. 🎉Awesome ❤
THRUSTERS didnt work to put it into correct angle you can see its still spining ( frozen thrusters ) its not incredible the  things spining ..are you two looking at the same Video you can see the raw metal heating up ????
Improper orientation prior to entering the atmosphere.  Possibly RCS thruster issues.
why is stuff falling off of it?
Starlink worked.
Amazing……
At last we have images of how an uncontrolled reentry looks like
50 years ago we tested and deployed rockets that landed on the moon. It's not easy, and it takes extraordinary time and human input. the military industrial complex is shifting to the billionaire conglomatariate - musk, bezos, arnaults, gates - it is what it is so long as we accept it
It's like a bunch of teenagers are cheering as $2 billion of taxpayer money is burned. At least NASA acted seriously as the money flashed to flame.
Where is NBC, CBS, ABC coverage of this super event?
What an amazing achievement! Go SpaceX!
What a wonder.
looks like CGI to me
Descobri 2 coisas hoje! o sol não é amarelo e a terra não é plana😄😄😄
Wow wow wow wow 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍👍👍👍
Starship has yet to orbit the earth a year after the first flight even though Musk promised NASA orbital refueling by 2022.  It burned up on reentry and the booster hit the ocean at mach 6.  Success!
Did it explode?
Looks like they couldn’t control the orientation of the vehicle as it hit the atmosphere.
https://youtu.be/797jevfbsEE?si=ZR6PpyeVkSePcIPp
What was all the Junk floating by the ship?
Something about a room full of nerds cheering like they are watching the Superbowl is getting to me 😢
They said this is for training and to learn about a billion times. Intentional.
what is lot of debris fall from starship show on camera.
I can't believe that the parents don't see that the Starship is not stable when entering the atmosphere..... even crazier is the crowd shouting in the background, unaware of the situation.... it is necessary to check everyone's IQ before the online transmission
Hmm...imo, it looks like when the flaps started activating they 'flexed' the ship and too many tiles 'zippered' off....which led to a plasma burn-through somewhere. Phenomenal job SpaceX ! Everyone knows the tile 'problem' will be fixed.
Lol, thy are talking like they have no clue that the ship is wobbling and doing some other not intended stuff and then probably explodes and still they just keep on talking like nothing is happening, everything is going fine!
But the MAain news are having "Failure" big in their headline..... they are making me so mad.....
So, what happened then? Burned on reentry?
Way to go, SpaceX
Starlink cameras did a phenomenal job! Congratulations Space X
There it is!
Cool! so watch in a few weeks some fake AI experiment will attempt a hoax LOL!
Они так радуются и апладируют каждой ерунде))) , уверен что когда смывают воду в унитазе это тоже событие, тоже вызывает восторг)))
The commentators REALLY need to learn timing. (Are they engineers?) Let us hear the crowd cheer and live the moment, feel the excitement! Instead they yell over the excitement and ramble through historical footage. Short and concise is what people want durning the action. If mission control is hollering we want to hear it, and to cheer with them! There is PLENTY  of time to explain all the little details later. No need for them to yell over all the best, most awe inspiring bits. They clearly have no idea how many people get put off by that.
At 1:52, you can see tiles , black one side/ white the other, falling. Notice the plasma is touching the non-protected part of starship at 4 min +
starlink is above the plasma so it can receive data ....below and thru plasma it is blackout
Skip to 3:20 to see plasma
Was there a video of the splashdown?
So the booster failed, steering fins went bananas, satellite slit did not open, the ship entered the atmosphere sideways and burnt completely? They make this sound like a succes, but was it? Didn't just everything planned went wrong? Totally destroyed booster and destroyed ship? Like flight nr. 2? I hope SpaceX will show and explain all the details
Awesome! Totally awesome!
Ok
What a wonderful world ❤🚀🇺🇸 Nerds ROCK !
Dune 2 got it wrong
What a gorgeous compliment of engineering and technology. Way to go SpaceX! 👍👍👍
Need better glue for the heat tiles.
I love how, at 6:53, she grabs a heat tile from the "You know it just fucking blew up" stack of props.
Absolutely Amazing!
I wish I could go up there, looks beautiful
just with the successful launch and bay doors opening and closing ok this rocket is capable putting 200 tons in orbit. to put that in perspective, the entire iss with all its additions after all these years circling the earth weighs 465 tons. so already they have proven they could have another iss in orbit with 2 launches !!!
Still needs work on tile attachment.  It was raining tiles!
looking from ift1 to ift3, the rate at which starship is improving is amazingly fast
elon needs to launch little comms balls like the japanese moon lander dropped camera balls.  Or maybe little comms radios.  Make it small enough that it doesn't create plasma, or make it light enough that it doesn't have the gravitational pull and it can send data.... or give it they dynamics of a space feather, so that the starship can dump data into the space feather, drop it in space, and it can upload data to starlink before it falls in the ocean.  why not have a series of airplanes with radar and visuals?  If the rocket has trajectory X, at 25,000 KMper hour, then its not going to take a right angle turn for a whole KM, so put up some airplanes.
Why can't we have a REAL man narrating this video?
So happy to see SpaceX doing so good. Love  it
WHY IS THERE DEBREE FLYING AROUND...IS THIS A HOLLYWOOD PICTHRE.
Indoctrination.
Wow so incredibly amazing
Kermit the frog play by play 🤙
It did not even manage to land, but lost contact, spun out and crashed. Elon sure can waste tax payers money. 3 rockets now without success. Cost 1 BILLION dollars. Money that could be spent on welfare instead.
If you could get an announcer without a apeech disability with that lisssssp thay would be great.
🤯🤯🤯
I feel like I’m watching a sport i know nothing about and don’t know why and what everyone is clapping and cheering about…
Beyond phenomenal: way to go Elon and ALL of the SpaceX team....wonderful...keep going...you will put humanity ont he moon and mars.
Pfft, AI-generated
Thise guys innthe background claping and shouting really need to learn how to shut the fuck up during a live mission. Imagine that kind of behaviour in a NASA control room.
Got to get me a ride on that!
Where today Space-X saw plasma, tomorrow it will see blood...
Amazing!!!
Acts 2:38 ❤❤❤❤❤
Nor sure but I think they lost some of those heat tiles
Starship stared glowing and Reentry start exactly at kremline line (100km above).
The amount of debris is massive. Also, the images are amazing. It's interesting how they try to avoid mentioning the Space Shuttle. For me, it's clear why.
. . . a melting Elon fart in the sky over the Indian Ocean. . . What a success!
Such drama queens and queens reporting here.
Good job!!!
This Starship crap does NOT help humanity.  It only increases Global Warming.  Musk is basically a kid that has been given the keys to destroy the house while the parents are away.  In this case, the government are the parents that should NOT be allowing citizens in space.  Musk could be a spy for all we know up in space collecting satellite info for other countries.  Musk is NOT American.  He was born in South Africa.  Money should NOT give you access to air space vulnerable to cyber attacks.
was Awesome Flight
So Kerbal!
Fuel on both stage 1 and 2 was not enought to land safely. It's as if it was planned that way. Stage 2 looked like it went through what if this happens testing to see if it can recover. Both stages testing is best to do it now before the real thing that might happen in future flights. It's how it's done and it was well done. Way to go Space X
Go Elon Musk
My Kerbal experience tells me that going noes into the re-entry probably brought the shock-wave too close to the metal causing the vehicle loss.  If it'd kept belly front, i'd probably have been OK.
I love the view. I have flown the parabolic mars landing about a thousand times. Can’t get enough starship
This happens to me in KSP all the time, lol. But seriously, getting this far in flight is a huge win for the Starship team. Congrats!
Did the payload bay doors successfully deploy, was the test relight successful, and were those tiles seen coming off in the slipstream during reentry?
What a view! Think of all the data they accumulated before the ship was lost. Congratulations SpaceX!!
Wow - the fan-boys are out in force. The images are amazing - but they are images of a ship spinning out of control as it burns up on re-entry. The booster also crashed, at twice the speed of sound. Neither will be recovered. The programme is years behind schedule and horribly over budget. So what exactly are you celebrating?
So.... It exploded?
Next ship needs more orientation thrusters, it tumbles way too much IMO
So did it make the splash down or did it burn up on re entry?
These shots are just mindblowing! What a time to be alive.
The footage of the plasma will definitely help to improve future heat shields
Gracias comandante Chávez
*Thanks to 6000 starslink satellites on space,we got real time reentry footages in 4k*
Historical moment
How did SpaceX get Starship above the "dome"?  HaHaHa I bet that is what the flat earthers are talking about now.
It disentigrated at 40 miles up going 16,000mph. = loss of telemetry
Congrats!
Add a dragon x spaceship to the nose of the starship
Is this the one that has disappeared?
I’ve always wanted to see the real plasma during re-entry, but NASA has never been able to show us. This is. Wet impressive.   The main stream media didn’t even show this, rather ABC news YouTube channel put up a headline that SpaceX lost the booster in their third launch attempt. So shameful of them.
Ya another fake video so lame wake up people. Wonder why they need to hide thumbs down?
The procedure looks like uncontrolled rolling falling, but not managed descent. Isn't it?
Con man Musk does it again. Space pirate to the nth.
Was this at all correct?  It looked like it was rolling and tumbling.   Pieces were coming off.
Starship flies like a rock. Zero control.
Just awesome views!!! That plasma just blows my mind! Looks like the ship tumbled right before losing signal, will be very exciting to read the findings!
That thing was raining broken tiles at ~2:10. Also, there is one moment where the ship was not aligned with the airstream and was definitely baking stainless steel on the upper left side. It didn’t seem like the ship was fully under control.
This plasma.. pillow is awesome. What a view, that was an incredible stream.
Looks like the heat shield tiles were coming off during re-entry
FYI it's not the friction of the atmosphere it's the compression of the air hitting starship causing the plasma, friction is there but it's the compression causing the majority of the plasma.
firstime not a vfx😊
Today, the hearts of space exploration enthusiasts beat faster as the SpaceX team made history with the successful completion of the Starship's 3rd Integrated Flight. It's incredible to be a part of this journey and witness this project go from concept to reality. Congratulations to the team! Happy Birthday SpaceX! And Happy Pi day!  Thank you for the excitement, and see you on the next flight! ♥️🚀💯
That can’t be good for the atmosphere can it????
Ein Gefühl wie 1969.
So, what happened to ship?
It is IN ORBIT.  Not ON ORBIT!!!
It’s so cool dopinder from Deadpool is a commentator
Pretty Cool, I am 70 and still alive to see this re-entry.How amazing is the last part of my life. Thanks to all the amazing young man and woman and most of all to Elon Musk. KEEP YOUR FEET GROUNDED.
This is onlyfans for nerds. I love it!
I'm sure the Elon haters will claim that losing comms on re-entry is yet another failure of Starship!
hmmm, looks like the rear flaps may have lost their actuators, just before we lost signal, couldn't hold her out of the role
The special effects keep getting better and better. Hats off to Elon. I almost couldn't see the green screen!
It's amazing that this is actually the real reentry and not a 3D animation!
jesus, so many space debris...
Is there another version of this without the unless commentary and those stupid WOooowwWs ??
Just WOW!
Absolutely amazing 🫨
Om😢g this is best thing I ever seen in my life❤.. Space x
These launches are becoming more and more  suss af
Putin is crying.
It appears those flaps do not have any effect at all.
All that money and technology and the cam footage is just trash
SPACEX is Insane they’re doing things out of movies we never thought were possible.
Bs
Yeah... Seeing the Plasma wave start forming in real time LIVE on Starship's camera, is DEFINATELY a highlight of 2024 for me, just unbelievable !! 🤩
AMAZING!
absolutely decadent how they mix metric and imp measures.
I don’t care what anyone says, I am calling this launch a fully successful launch. If it wasn’t for the software hiccup, they totally would have had it. Also, when the plasma started showing, that has to have been the coolest video in history.
The debris we see ..is that tiles coming off ?
So, did it land?
Amazing Footage, BRAVO
Very cool. Almost, damn they need to and are going to keep trying. The starkink signal is amazing. Way to much spin on the starship, they will work it out. Three to four month wait... Damn.
This video is so much better muted..
calm down
The data is the payload.  Very nicely put.
stupidly annoying cheering
I value your perspective and content.Bitcoin is on its way to breaking records, getting closer to hitting new high prices, showing that it's gaining more value and could go even higher than we've seen before. This could mean great things for people looking to invest, suggesting now might be a good time to get involved before it jumps even higher. It's an exciting moment that could change the game in general...managed to grow a nest egg of around  1.2Biitcoin to a decent 6.4Biitcoin. At the heart of this evolution is indeko Glenn, whose deep understanding of both cryptocurrency and traditional trading has been instrumental. Her holistic approach to investment and commitment to staying abreast of market trends make her an invaluable ally in navigating this new era in cryptocurrency investment....
Absolutely beautiful and a huge step forward for the species
This is just plain beautiful! What an amazing ball of earth we live in...
Amazing to see plasma on the Starship flap.🥹
My mounth is opened...😂 Congratulation.
I’m so blown away 🤩
This is so aweseme. Go SpaceX, Elon and USA!!
Wow! You just have to love Elon Musk.
再突入の瞬間
Derick Henry is doing his ravens interview live. I’m watching that instead.
A lot better than NASA
Cameras holding up very well
Everybody cheering their own demise.
Why are there no attitude jets? Relying solely on the fins is a bit dim as they only become useable after contact with the atmosphere, the ship must be stable during the whole descent.
Very nice
So what happened after reentry is the telemetry just down or did it explode?
Intensely amazing view.  Wow.
Looks like that whale from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
Amazing footage, looks like it’s in a top spin and coming in hot on the starboard side, but corrected by 4:18 mark, flaps working overtime on that plasma,
I love the fact that SpaceX lets us celebrate the failures and the successes at the same time.  Because really, even the failures have been successes!
Virtually uncontrolled. I'll wager that the tiles separated from the front flaps and failed the flaps as attitude controllers. Every vehicle entering has attitude thrusters firing almost continuously till they get under 90km.
Insane
It’s a poor concept. An 8 year olds idea of a space ship.
Tiles flying off?
3:19 Heres where things get hot 🔥🔥
Great coverage. Minor detail: FARthest not FURthest.
Yep that's a flat earth 🌎
I wonder once the space craft entered and maybe the computer was saying  a possible threat to the area and they blew up the craft.
The male announcer sounds like Steven Bonnell, just bizarre.
Starship entered the atmosphere engine end first. No control of the entry apparently. Still an amazing success!
I belive in UFOs
What an era to be alive 🫡
A shame it blew up during reentry but it was amazing to watch live.
That is absolutely unbelievable - one of the most incredible things I've ever seen.  Literally caused me to scream in amazement and brought tears to my eyes it was so incredible.
talking heads TALKING TO MUCH
I think they could improve that roll control a bit.
I can't believe NASA didn't try tumbling and spinning on re-entry. 🤣 Great way to help the heat shield to last longer. 💥
Fake
Funny that their animated version didn't feature the rolling out of control and the direction the plasma was flowing just flipping around 180 degrees several times.
While this footage is truly amazing, the collective cheering nerdgasm is hilarious. 🤓
This was uncontrolled reentry. It was still rotating when it hit the upper atmosphere. And then desintegrated like doomed Columbia Space Shuttle.
I was so excited when I watched the ship reenter the atmosphere! It was just incredible! Go Starship!
If nothing else, SpaceX got lots of data. The approach velocity of SH is really scary (compare with F9). And the orientation of Starship during reentry was all over the place. There are clearly control issues with both vehicles. Makes the prospect of catching these guys out of midair-air really exciting.
what a historical moment and a giant leap for mankind
Did it tumble and break up?  The telemetry seemed to indicate that.
lol this is horrible!!
Gene Kranz needs to teach these idiots a few things about not cheering yourselves until the damn mission is over.
You guys rock at Spacex ,keep plugging along folks👍👍🚀🚀🚀🚀
It burnt up.
Wow 🤩
Somebody give that narrator some testosterone……
had a terrible day so far, but this lit me up instantly
The HEAT is real
While cool, the crowd noise is about as staged and fake  as a live taping of an 80s sitcom. 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️
Is it back from Kepler 160 b already???
I can just hear those miserable feckers in the flat earth community desperately trying to come up with a reason why SpaceX would spend so much money on a CGI re-entry. Cry some more morons!
Starlink is a hack
Closer to Moon I hope
Are the other comments bots? Celebrating the booster crashing at 1km/s, the LOX leak that put the whole thing into a spin, the failure to open the door, the failure to reignite the engines, the tumble and eventual destruction into the atmosphere... and people are like: OMG, well done!  Either you lack the understanding that this was a complete bust, or it's simply bots. Jeez.  I mean you can even see it right here in this video. The whole ship tumbles and spins out of control from the previous leaking. Flaps won't do jack if you go into the atmosphere at 26743 km/h with the shield facing every which way but to the right side.  Then once the ship is pretty much done (rapid deconstruction / exploding), they quickly cut the camera to talk about the heat shields that were facing the wrong way. $3 billion tax payer dollars well grifted.
Опять взорвался пепелац😂 Амайзинг 😂 Маскгений 😂 Не могут повторить технологию 70х.
What a dumb world we live in, where the rich, because of their wealth, get to do whatever they want with OUR ATMOSPHERE and OUR SPACE. Pathetic man. I honestly do not appreciate any of these billionaires.
Awesome!!!
The camera is located at the left upper flap which mean the Starship enter atmosphere at nearly 90 degree angle...this is crazy! very different than Space shuttle
This is magical! What a moment to see so clearly and for so long.
I really wish they would CUT OUT all the screaming and yelling in the background!!! So annoying when your trying to enjoy the the actual footage!!!
❤❤❤
3:13 is incredible, the moment the plasma becomes visible is the coolest
Simply Stunning!!
How does the camera withstand this temperature?
Pretty good proof of a Not flat earth, if they keep the video going during impact can also show its not hollow either
Tiles were falling of from very early on ! Vehicle rolling badly... out of control... do not yet have a valid design?
Is it me or has space travel become an episode on the home shopping network...
Did a lot better than last time, lost both vehicles sadly.
erm isnt it supposed to land?
Go SPACEX!!!!!!!❤
Is this the first ever live broadcast of spaceship re-entry in human history
amazing views
The plasma during reentry, damn It's magnificent 🤩🤩
I reckon on the next launch starship and the booster will atleast get through most of the atmosphere
Interesting.
Was this a controlled entry?  It looks like it was just rolling around
So much debree in 110 km ... ugh!
Need to mute the crowd.
Revelation 21:8  Yep, that's where all these deceivers are heading.
A lot of debris coming off of Starship.  Is that normal?
It looks like the ship was losing some of it's heat shield.  Great flight test!  Looking forward to the fight data info.
what's all those stuff flaking off?
4:06 looks like they are losing attitude control
Fan of SpaceX but also fan of truth, nobody commented that the ship clearly was totally out of control???
where did starship come down ?
Wait for media now...   ''Elon Musk spacex faces third FAILURE in a row'' :D
🇺🇸
I cant believe it. I didnt even believe it could survive at all once it re entered the atmosphere, but what did we just witnessed, we got to SEE it actually do it🤩
Was an awe inspiring moment in history 🚀
All the cheers is kinda funny. Idk. But still, cool.,
Most incredible re-entry footage to date. I'm so glad I got to witness this today.
forecast for the pacific is scattered steel showers
lol...Looks like cgi to me.  What a farce.  What is the plan?  To go to the moon when they destroy earth with geoengineering?  Only a fool would believe this nonsense.
Here we gomars is on the horizon
Why do they always put clueless people as "commentators".. talking about "heat-tiles" when the ship just exploded..? come on..! Otherwise congrats to SpaceX.. great achievement.. let's just hope it won't take months for the next test as you might be still "testing" by the time Moon landings are suppose to take place.. I truly and sincerely hope that Starship will become a fully reusable and most importantly inexpensive system..
LOS
If a spacecraft is spinning uncontrollably, because of venting. Docking is impossible and reentry is near impossible. Lot of work to do. 2026 is impossible now
wowwwwwwwww
Awesome 3rd flight!! Each flight they have gotten so much farther. This one they almost completed everything they planned!
shedding tiles like a cat sheds hair
Stop all this and use your money to feed hungry kids
So did it crash?
I do like how there isnt any toxic nationalism in these comments.
What a piece of junk. I'm never buying tesla! 😁
Parabéns espace X , magnífico
Hypebois loving this in the background
Totally out of control again. It was spinning the whole time
INSANE!!!!
So musk should ride the next one. Btw starship burning up on reentry is good? I mean, a few missing  tiles and everyone or everything would die or burn up right?
What is all the debris falling off before reentry?
Looks like they need to work out attitude control while on orbit/during the setup for reentry. Tremendous success on today's mission though.
Insane
Game on
First piece of very good news I've heard this morning!  Three cheers to everyone involve!
So recap: Both rockets lost....Mars here we come..
I believe there are something wrong happen with Starship thruster cause it is tumbling too much. We can clearly see that Staship re-entry on it's side while tumbling. Also, it seems that some piece of heat tiles is missing but still, far less than space shuttle. Look like it break up during re-entry and the signal blackout is due to the atenna was facing the wrong direction. Overall, it is still a great flight and I really look foward to IFT-4.
REAL TIME PLASMA 🤩😎
❤❤❤❤
Wow. Just insane views! Congrats SpaceX
Dear, it is burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. 18,000 less a few hundred. It did not survive. Data is good. You kids crack me up!
Cool
Another remarkable History in the Making. Congrats SpaceX and All spaceX team.
furthest and fastest it has ever burnt up. I love it!
One camera with a multi billion budget.   What a joke
The Earth's atmosphere is burning the pos up.
This is my favorite moment  That was awesome
Hahahahaha. Tiles. Because that worked so well on Shuttle..
lots of tiles falling off! ha ha ha ha
This is the most insane thing i have ever seen and a first for humans.. REAL TIME PLASMA not a video.. REAL TIME  utterly mind bending stuff.. what an awesome day for all us space nerds haha
Unfortunately, the signal was not reconnected in the end.
I love the excitement that the control surfaces move.
Great outcome today, congrats to SpaceX! Progress in leaps and bounds. Excellent engineering, fast tracked development and prototype test run.
Data!? You kids are not engineers! You just love collecting data on each failure. Cheating you way through college is catching up with you. ha ha ha ha
exciting
It did not reenter. It burnt up. What a joke!
Did it came back? What happened to it after this?
what a beautiful peice of engineering im glad i tuned in for this launch and reentry what a success.
