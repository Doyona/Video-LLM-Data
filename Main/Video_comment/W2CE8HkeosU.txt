Terrible.
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)!
This was a great collaboration 🙌🏽

Queen Naija ,H.E.R , Summer Walker, Jhene Aiko and Chris Brown are my R&B go-tos where I can catch a WHOLE vibe and get into MAJORITY of the album. Completely impressed & pleased with the quality R&B from Ms. Queen.
Love it  ❤🔥😜✌🏿
Lil Baby and Lil Durk are bros!!🔥

Queen Naija is great.. What a wonderful voice, and she is so sexy and beautiful... ❤️❤️Charles Ibegwam. Chimix@gmx. de
Love this song😘
😫😫😫i love her
Jesus is coming to get his people soon, repent, pray and tell your loved ones that you love them. Enjoy the little moments, laugh and be grateful for our time here is short but the beauty of heaven cannot be compared to this life. If you are going through something, it will get better, if you are feeling alone, you are not, you have a savior wanting to know you and love you and he has been waiting for you to go to him. God bless anyone reading this. You are loved.

hi sis
The all this love verse comes from a song by Donell Jones, all this love. Where's the creativity in music these day?!
Queen u worked hard babe and got where u got with CJ. Did u get married hun to Clarence?  Renzo got big quick he's really handsome.
🔥🔥🔥
if u and clarance in an open relationship just say dat..
Love this song she is beautiful🌹😍🔥lil Durk he is fine🔥🔥
“TRENCHES BABY” 😍😍
Y’all sampled an South African beat song By A-Reece~ Mgani
Durk slid
The queen is here to lead the people to love ?  All hail queen
Yo she sucks bro
durk prolly hit
the beat belongs to A Reece and south African rapper.( track name mngani wami) WFT they just change the pitch. the piano sample exactly the same.
SUS CAN SANGGGGGG IDC!!!!!
She can sing and people need to give her the credit she deserves
Yea-yee
I love this song
I just love her growth I've been a day oner, and the young lady she was is not the woman and inspiration we see today. Queen you are the mvp
So is u fw durk now
0:27 what ringtone is that ?
27 million
I can tell how she love her stuff and her kids and she don’t want to give up she best singer out there no mater how hard stuff going on she still handle stuff for her kid she don’t want be homeless and her kid grow up with no dad so we want her get better and be good at singing so she better at everything 💞❤️💕  No matter what she going through she still love her kid and her self❤️💞
The selective british presumably report because bridge mathematically stare afore a living pocket. shocking, few fierce snake
I know this beat came from and old song  but I can’t remember what song it was
Huehfdcduheheihdei
Shout out to Queen Naija lie to me ft lil durk
the sample used in this song is Dont leave me- Blackstreet
I want her outfit when she standing outside
She sounds good like always. The lyrics and the message are just sad though.  We women are better than that. I hope this is not what she goes through with Clarence. We should never have to accept and normalize infidelity. Just bc a dude comes home to you after "doing him", doesn't you are "winning". You're lowering you self worth.
I’m only here for queen
It’s was a joke everyone ok
Love the hook to this song she's knows she is the Queen at the end of the day getting whatever but them other chick is just fun 💯 Durk kilt it to
Durk u know better dis better be for India 😌
I hope India say something she better beat his ahh cuss who dis song for ?😑🤨 he wrong for dat but he swer he love ha like wtf and queen he don’t love u ok so leave him a alone he got a girl ok 🤨
Respect the GRIND!!!!!
QUEEN 😍😍😍😍!
My Girlllll. Straight fire. Per usual. Love watching you grow. 🤪✨🔥🔥🔥
Girl you fire❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

The song is good but it got me thinking she says “  as long as you don’t see nobody that I hang with “ and the relationship seems like ay we free to do what we want but in the song he says something about doing something  with her home girl...... lol some guys would fuck up everything even open relationships 😂

Dont ever let the truth reach your home if the Lie compliments your home better.....Do what you dont want seen or heard far from those you dont want to see or hear #PlayOnPlayerOrGameOver
Anyone else notice the beat is sampled from a boogie-right back
Ayeeeeee
Dear Naija you have talented voice, l love your voice. I go through most of ur romantic songs I really enjoy the way you sing. I'm very happy that you sing even Christian s song. My humble request if you could please change the way you 👗 dress many youngsters are lust of open chest.
Lil Durk is so fineeee and Queen Is beautiful they look cute together and this music video is fireee 🔥🔥🔥
Anyone got the piano chords for this?

Hey to whoever reads this. This Is a sign, Jesus loves you so so much and He has been right beside you through it all. He suffered and died for you and me. He will give you peace and take away your burdens. Please REPENT. He will make you new... 2 Corinthians 5:17. Come as you are. There isn’t any special thing you have to do. All you have to do is believe that Jesus is Lord. And make Him your personal Lord and saviour. And learn how to flee away from your old ways. He wants the best for you so please seek Him, repent and change. Start a relationship with Him. It doesn't hurt. It can start off as simple as having a conversation with Him as soon as you wake up and before you go to bed. Eventually He will guide you into what scriptures to read and how to pray. He loves and cares for you so so much. God bless and have a great day :)
😍😍😍

UNBELIEVABLE QUICK HERPES CURE BY HERBALIST RAZORHello!!! I’m indeed very happy for the great help that Dr Razor rendered to me,I was diagnosed with HSV 2 on  July 7, 2017 and I have tried all possible means to get cure but all to no avail, until i saw a post in a health forum concerning herbal doctor Dr Razor, who prepares herbal medicine to cure all kind of diseases/Infection including Herpes Simplex virus Type 2, at first i doubted if it was real but decided to give it a try, when i contact this herbal doctor via his email, He assured me of a cure, he prepared a herbal medicine and sent it to me via courier service, when i received this herbal medicine, he gave me instructions on how to use it, when i applied it as instructed, i was cured of this deadly virus within 18 days of usage,he told me to go for a medical check up and i went for test, I couldn't believe i was negative and the HERPES VIRUS in my body got cured, I and my family are so happy and grateful to God for using Dr Razor to Liberate me.

Queen got durk on thisssss😩yessss
Is that 2004-2008 style ?
Go Queen ! So proud of you!! 🔥🔥🔥❤️
People in the comments irritate me.. Acting like they so damn holy. "We" even if it was once in our lifetime have had someone that we didn't want a relationship with..  just the sex from. And if you young, Chile you have a lot of living to do to even attempt to speak on how other people decide to live their lives.. 😂 this song ain't for people in relationships.. And I'm IN a relationship saying this 😂 people get in relationships and married and act as if they never had a past 😂 Chile BYE 👋 sensitive ass generation 🙄 and some of y'all are too young to even have a PAST 😂
I just came to check out the person bearing my country’s name 🇳🇬
I love her voice. The message being spread to young women i do not.

Smh I hate the message in this song but I love the beat we got to stop trying to normalize cheating it’s not cool at all but I know on the other hand this is just for entertainment and to boost her career I know she’s not really living this kind of lifestyle cause as women we are worth more than a man that is unfaithful and shouldn’t be with a messy man PERRIODT

Came for durk but this girl bad 😍
😩😩😩
Queen has a sweet tone,so happy she's on top.Congratulations
🔥🔥🔥
Her wink is so cute with them pretty lashes 🥰🥰
Was sent this video... the original song was the music I listened to 30 years ago. I hope you can enjoy the music without following the lyrics. Someone who breaks promises, calls your friends (?) on the side, and lies to you but can still come through and hit, does NOT love you properly. That’s the kind of “love” you can do without unless his version of love IS your kind of love then carry on😳. No judgement.
I love this songggg. If I’m not playing it, I’m singing it!!!!!
I need Von back. Queen please don't tell me you just threw up 3 6's.  I need Von back... NOW!
Big up yourself Queen, heard your song on radio in Bermuda..banger.....💣💣💣...Bless up Queen n Spicy Management ..#fan 💣💯💣💯
i love your version but  the Original from Blackstreet-don't leave me   is still the best
Jcole should get on this
This was fire.... this is just another example of a timeless record sampling "A Dream" by Debarge. Such great talent they killed it !!! Love you guys.   Everyone who's able to survive 2020 and the craziness  deserves good vibes and music like this ❤ hope you guys enjoy the holiday season and let's continue to thrive, prosper, and grow in happiness 😊
Istg i

Ft. lil Durk means I’m listening
❣️❣️❣️❣️xx.tocq_boca.xx
love thisssssssssss
I feel like this song was her element. And she snapped🧏🏽‍♀️💗
Ok kids quick music fun fact from this old lady. The Melody that Miss Queen is using is originally by Debarge- “A dream” not Tupac “I ain’t mad at cha”
Lil Durk fine fine 🤎
God's grace covers all when we repent and true peace comes from God alone through His Son Yeshua (Jesus Christ).  Choose righteousness God loves U:)
This song is such a bop.
https://youtu.be/VMEqpDNoflI

IF YOU START READING MAKE SURE YOU FINISH THIS IS A SIGN FROM GOD FOR YOU!!: GUYS IM BEING DEAD SERIOUS JESUS PUT IT ON MY HEART TO WRITE THIS AND SAID IT WOULD SPEAK TO SOMEONE REALLY!! Please don’t think I’m playing cuz I would never lie on His name like that 💯  God says He sees you & notices you for your true beauty. He said that there are times where you’ve struggled to find peace & happiness but those times you looked haven’t been ignored by Him. He said that He sees and notices all the hurt you’ve been through & all the times you stayed up overthinking. He says He has been there with you everyday even if it didn’t feel like you feel Him. He said that He loves you for who you are & understands you more than you sometimes understand yourself. He wants you to know nothing you do can make Him love you any less. He says that He’s seen your hurt and how people have said words that hurt you more than they know. He says He has compassion for what you went through and He wants you to know you’re never too far from Him. He said He will lift your spirit up & refresh you & will show you where you need to go in life. He said that He sees your family & cares for them so much & that they will be protected by Him wherever they go. He says He has seen your tears and the tears that you held in & you didn’t see it but He was there with you crying next to you. He feels hurt every time you felt hurt. He says He sees you as His precious beloved, He calls you His beloved. He sees you for who you really are, and it’s hard for others to understand but He understands you completely. He wants to give you His love into your heart & fill you with peace like you’ve never felt before. He wants to be your friend, He wants a relationship with you. He’s asking you to invite Him into your life. He’s at the door right now and wants to give you his blessings and unconditional love and peace. He’s asking if your willing to invite Him into your life?   IF YOU WANT TO ACCEPT HIM INTO YOUR LIFE JUST SAY THIS PRAYER OUT LOUD, NOT JUST IN YOUR HEAD, JUST SAY IT IT TAKES 1 MIN BUT MAKES YOUR SOUL 100% GO TO HEAVEN AND GIVES GOD ACCESS TO WORK IN YOUR LIFE, DONT HISITATE!!! MEAN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, & BELIEVE HE HEARD YOU BECAUSE HE DID!! ITS THAT EASY IM BEING SO SERIOUS SAY THESE WORDS AND MEAN IT & YOULL GO TO HEAVEN!!!   "Heavenly Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. I now renounce any connection, attachments, and leverage I have given willingly or unwillingly to the devil. I acknowledge him as an enemy and accused against me and also against you and I will not support anything he plans on doing in my life. I declare his assignments in my life broken and destroyed in Jesus name. I declare that I trust you are much much more stronger than him and I declare that I as a new believer have been given power and authority over and against him in Jesus name. You are my defense and my stronghold, my heart will trust in you. In Jesus name, I declare that my thoughts, actions, and behaviors are free from the devils doing and I know and have faith you are fighting for me. Anytime I feel weird or off or feel something trying to attack my spirit, I will realize that is not you but from the devil and I will say out loud ‘In Jesus name, I am free and on fire for God, anything near or around me will feel the scorching fire of the Holy God and the fire will not leave them in Jesus name’! (Literally say you are pouring fire on the demons around you whenever you feel off or just mad at the demons for being evil lol but you HAVE to say in Jesus name you are doing this) Lord thank you for hearing me and I trust and believe your ears are always listening to my prayer and even if I don’t see it with my eyes, my life is not changed in Jesus name. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen."  HES FOREVER IN YOUR LIFE AFTER YOU SAID THAT PRAYER NOW EVEN IF YOU DONT FEEL HIM JUST KNOW HE IS WATCHING OVER YOU! NOW ITS YOUR TURN TO GROW YOUR FRIENDSHIP W HIM! YOURE ALREADY ON YT SEARCH UP HOW TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!! THATS HOW YOU START HEARING HIM AND SEEING HIM AS A FRIEND!! DONT BE MAD AT GOD FOR NOT TALKING TO YOU IF YOU NEVER GET TO KNOW HIM AND TALK TO HIM. THATS HOW YOU BUILD A FRIENDSHIP!!!!11111hhhggghhjtgg  WATCH THIS VIDEO HOW TO GET CLOSER TO GOD: https://youtu.be/ljsbz6ngkSw  Hhfvdgvx yggg

I’m so proud of Queen😍. She’s been through a lot and she is still pursuing her career. She’s a MOTHER and that’s comes before anything. But she’s doing everything for her and her kids.

i wonder what durk was thinking when he saw them pics of queen
t-series
Yessss!!
Queen keep shinning girl , biggest supporter ever and Lil durk came back with that fire 🔥 with queen I love you guys via wifey ❤️
My dad songs
Lil durk killed that shit. He dn carried the song with only a few lyrics.
The blond hair is a vibe on her
This song slaps
okay but is anyone gonna mention that fact that Teyana Taylor been killing it wit the music video directing thang!!
Love this song and video. Her and Durk got a cool ass vibe.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😻😍🔥
He's terribly fine....
I’m here for durkio
I feel sorry for people who haven't discovered this song yet😍
i love yall i wish yall was boyfriend and girlfriend that will be so cute
Tupaccc 😍😍 the paino from i aint mad at chu
I thought it’s AReece( the starting the beat).
I hear Tupacs beat in there
Anyone else hear the a boogie sample in the beginning...ik its been in other songs but thats what came to mind
Yo queen naija beautiful is hell
Can someone please tell me that beat? I know it’s a sample
I think ive liked queen naijas music since hearing her song 'medicine', was so relatable. And i love the way she talks about double standards in it as well, with the whole 'how would you like it if i did the same to you' concept. 💞 You can tell this girl has been through, a lot so young and despite that is very resilliant. Shes beautiful, genuine not full of her self has humility and sings like an Angel will always be a fan of this beautiful soul.

I’m a fan ❤️
Been on repeat since I heard this song 🔥🔥
I don't know peeps snooze on Queen. She's been true since day 1. Guess there's no accounting for true talent. Shameful!!
Okayy with the debarge sample in the back
You think her relationship with Chris and how it ended made her a better artist?

Why the girls bump into each other in the beginning like that 😂😂🤣
God is so creative, everything aligns the way it’s suppose to. no free will, if anybody thinks that’s false you just don’t have purpose.

For those who want to know Jesus Christ, my precious saviour say this salvation prayer out loud " Dear God I come to you a sinner I repent from the bottom of my heart please forgive me. Jesus, I believe that GOD raised you from death I make you Lord in my life baptize me with the fire of the Holy Spirit burn the chains that hold me captive to obeying you. I believe Jesus Christ you are the son of the living God please write my name in the book of life from today Jesus I make you LORD and saviour in my life guide and protect and teach me your word AMEN"  Listen to this No Fear by Kari Jobe  👇👇click on it  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lZnqyWfYom0  That's all next read the book of John,  Romans & Hebrew..listen to teachings on youtube Evangelist David Diga, Apostle Joshua Selman, Andres Bisonni, Myles Monroe, Tony Evans. Watch the movie Gospel of John on YouTube u will know how precious Jesus Christ is he is amazing and waiting on you....
The is most definitely giving  Newstalgia! it’s new with that old school school sound and vibe

I dont really wanna bring it up but who been supporting Queen since it was Chris and Queen!!
I peep the "My Dawg" (Bandgang Masoe) piano cover in the background
Minha RAINHA
Seems like Chris was holding her back , after she left Chris she went AL THE WAY up .... 10.30.20 misunderstood
lil durk on anything is a BANGER !!
I wondered if they pay DORNELL JONES for sampling his song- This Luv ???? Not Gon lie I love the song but damnnnn no ORIGINALS
A-Reece _ Mngani From South Africa  Sounds way better but I guess his underrated
💚
Lil Durk so good he got 2 different types of ft features
I’ve replied this song ova a hundred times and just noticed how Queen started off saying “bet they hear these words and call me foolish” 🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️ well she was freakin right 😂 all the controversy but the song 🔥 tho
This record is 🔥   Chris & Queen should do a song together Love VS Pain record 🔥
When Queen winked 😻, that was for me
The Baddest tune! Omg! 😍😍😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes Queen !!
Hey to whoever reads this. Just here sharing the gospel. This Is a sign, Jesus loves you so so much and He has been right beside you through it all. He wants the best for you so please seek Him, repent and change. For no one know the time or hour that the Father will come. Not even the Son, not even the angels, not even me or you. ONLY THE FATHER. That day will be scary. Thats why we ALL have to be ready. Matthew 6:33/ Matthew 24:36. Start a relationship with Him. It doesn't hurt. It can start off as simple as having a conversation with Him as soon as you wake up and before you go to bed. He loves and cares for you so so much. God bless and have a great week :)
It really dont move me :/ I pass on this one
Its the libra on libra fa me 🧡

This song hot
2:31 😂
I love herrrrr
Well if y’all didn’t know, she sampled Donell Jones - This Luv & it was about him being a side dude. He literally only wanted relations & no relationship because he didn’t want her lying about being in one. So that’s where her lyrics stem from.
Queen look good all thru this video
They would be the next jayz and Beyoncé
I like how they used the topline of « We know » by fifth Harmony
I can’t believe ppl compare Durk to Calboy Durk can’t sing for shit💯😭
TODAY VIDEOS !  AND USING 90'S SAMPLE FROM 70'S     MUSIC !   !   GO FIGURE THESE MINDLESS PRODUCERS ! 🙃
I can’t understand what lil Durk is saying
I la ha so much .......ha voice so beautiful 💕💕💕💕💕💕
A humble person at its finest, this is just the beginning Queen 👑 we been here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She is such a beautiful possum 😍

hello
Officially my favourite song. Damn 😩😍
This is my jam! Love the sound. 💜
let me find out LiL Durk abt to bagg queen😏
Queen Turn Back To GOD! He loves you so much and even gave me a dream of me warning you about the way your going is life andI'm how its NOT the way your gonna get into heaven. Stop Making these degrading songs approving cheating and sidekick trends, it's not of GOD and he see's it ALL. You and the alot of other lost souls might think it's cute but it's not, it's of the Satan. The Most High wants you be MARRIED with a Husband and have sexual relations with Him, not none of this "just dont lie to me about it but it's cool" crap 😕 Stop dressing half naked in videos and in general and show some respect for yourself. You are a beautiful girl and do not need tiny pieces of clothing and enticement to show how talented you are. Who cares what the World thinks and how THEY want you to look. They dont got a Heaven or Hell to put you in. But God does.. REPENT Queen and everybody else reading this. You've been warned. We are in the Last Days and Jesus Christ is Coming Back Very Soon and if your not right with him, Obeying his Commandments, repenting daily, and Building your relationship with him you will be condemned and thrown into Pits of Hell for Eternity. Think it's a joke if you want to, smh. Queen you will be in my prayers, and everybody else reading this as well. Bless up brothers and sisters. Turn around while you still can.. Those who are chosen by The Most High will heed this warning and know what to do.. REPENT REPENT REPENT.   (I'm saying this out of love because I know Hell is real and I dont wanna see anybody down there, but if you ignore this message it wont be God sending you there..  you'll be sending yourself.  💯🙏
🇳🇬🇳🇬#endsars

Her and Layton greene give me similar vibes🥰
I love the song! Queen will snap in anything regarding her voice 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The visuals 💯
Great
the song in the beat or song kinda sound like sofia the first (no hate btw) i like it
If you lie to me, you gone be picking up teeth off the PAVEMENT 🗣 remix
yassssssss gurll!!!!!!!
her singing at alll that
Beautiful song I luv her voice hate the blonde hair
On the “nah nah nah “ part I always hear the royal family intro 😂😂
Came for durk dats all queen did amazing I like her music just dont listen to her lil durk part tho and this song
Brooo I’ve ALWAYS loved this piano instrumental since I heard it as a kid in soul food!  She did this joint here justice!
ain't know bout credit tryna buy her ass wit obamacare lmaooo
I know both of them taken but they look cute together 😍. but I respect their relationships
Very nice.
Am fallin in love wit dis song yow 2.5 ppl unlike this  song y'all trippin'
Peep The Tupac Sample In The Back Shii Slap
My new favorite singer! Every song is a HIT! And she is absolutely gorgeous.
The end 😂💯
Who else played this like five times in a row
But no cap the Obama Care line took me out
I’m too in love with this girl y’all, I be BUMPIN HER MUSIC! My mama took my speaker 💀😭
Lil Durkkkk 🥵
Maybe I pay attention to lyrics too much, and yes the beat and flow is nice, but she's not giving good advice. I enjoy her music, but listen to what she's saying! She's fine with an open relationship.... as longs as it's none of her friends. Get away from that toxicity and love yourself! Don't block your blessings settling for less! We all learn on our own timing, but use that time wisely.
Man queen the shit!!! 🔥
Seeing queen now from when I used to watch her home funny ass videos back in the day I swear I'm so proud of her (hell fuckin yes)😍😍😍😍🤜🤛😝
💯😍
“Don’t want broken promises don’t want apologies” - Period
Yo sexy asss
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Queen so bomb
This song has been on repeat since it dropped and pack lite.
https://youtu.be/04Roh3SDyN0 Naija boy
https://youtu.be/04Roh3SDyN0
Can we get a bts pls 😩!!
teyana snapped on this video
I love it😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
Why they would look cute as a couple
Your Music is GARBAGE !!!!
Pac and Donell Jones + Queen Naija's voice = perfection. Could have chosen better lyrics, but song still catchy.
QUEEEEEN I AM INLOVE WITH THIS SONG......ON MY TOP LIST OF FAVS...IM SO SRIOUS. I HAVE LISTENED TO THIS SONG COUPLE TIMES EVERYDAY FROM THE TIME I SAW IT. AND IM LOVING YOU IN THIS VID. PLUS I LIKE LIL DURK!🙈
This sample is a classic.  Blackstreet - don’t leave me 🔥💯
Yassssssss Queen!!!!!!
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus saves.   God bless you
Quake sent me here
I fw with her heavy because she give me so much hope in life  && Her music is so relatable, her voice is beautiful.  Telling you forever my lost best friend Happy belated birthday baby 🎉🤍
queen you did that and lil dirk you did that to💖💕💕💕💕💕
It seem like she the only YouTuber really focused on her music
One random person that likes this will be a millionaire💯🔥🔥 Agdop.com
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I luv this song! I’m bout to have it on repeat! YAAS. 👸🏾 🙌🏾Queen come thru!
I ain't mad at'cha
🔥🔥🔥😍😍🥰🥰💞
I don't like the song because she is basically saying the man can cheat on her as long as it's not one of her friends.... I will end it here because the rest is negative!
Yo thisss fireee🔥🔥🔥
🥶
dang she's killin it😍🔥
snapped ✨
I love that she branched out she was bomb from the start though ❤❤ #DelawareLove
It’s the matching hair for me 😍🥰
Jesus loves you. REPENT. JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN
Jesus loves you. REPENT. JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN
Lowkey be i texting all her friends.....hahahaha

Damn y’all should actually be together foreal
Durkiooooo
It’s the Donnell jones line for me
Longlivepac💚✔
Am I the only one who hears a little Ariana Grande in her voice 😍
What made the dope was the Donell Jones (all this love ) hook and mixed it with blackstreet (dont leave me girl)
Yes ma’am!!!!
ppl forgetting this a Tupac beat
Heart of love from🇯🇲
Look  at her she look soo pretty with pink on 💗💗!
pressure
Omg ❤💯💯💯 this song is killing me 🎼🔊🎧🔥🔥🔥☄☄☄
I love it😍😍
So good
WTF Durk be talking bout???🤔
That outfit at the end, I’m a Carolina girl, born and raised, need that!
You really snapped ❤️😎😎
🐐‼️
Spike Tey done did it again. Yesss mamas!
lol...good music colourist 😒😊..so much talent but colourist...just sad
Dude this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boy wasn’t writing shit on that paper 😂
Since queen left her stupid ex Chris she’s been looking better & doing better, girl keep going we’re here for it😍!
Queen you go crazy beautiful
Can’t relate to those damn lyrics but Teyana did her thing with the visuals as always
It’s a cool song, but it sounds like toxicity. 😂... lol
That sample is straight 🔥🔥🔥
The message in this song is what bad men want women to believe is right. It doesn’t matter if I cheat on you and lie to you, as long as it’s not with your friends. The spirit of a bad man is the spirit that is singing this song. And using this artist to push that horrible message. DON’T FALL FOR IT LADIES.
YASSSSS, any song this girl makes or is on is FIREEEEEE💛💛💛 gotta love it
Queen looks fire 🔥🔥🔥 in this vid
A-Reece sample on Mgani
Love this ❤️
Most of the songs I’ve heard from her are about being the other chick or not caring if her dude cheats etc I don’t like that shit but she does have a nice voice she could do better messages
Y’all got a slap for 2020 straight up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That i aint mad at ya reference tho 😍
Pressure 🔐 ❤️🔥💯
Where is her bucket hat from
I thought this was “right back” by a boogie for a sec
I love this ❣️
Happy Birthday Queennnnnnn
This song is the shit I can see qn award for this one good job yall
that jump suit though.
She can actually sing she put in her work 🔥🔥
Jada picket smith: *Oh this my shit👀*
Kelly and Nelly Dilemma vibes 😍
2:38 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Why does this reminds me of Brent Faiyaz’s video
This kinda sound like “it’s the royal family” intro song
Queen vocals always on point y'all doing y'all thang
She's not hurt anymore she is happy and not upset because of that toxic relationship with Chris but she's happy because she is with someone how loves her and not with someone who cheats and lies to her❤
God Bless everybody reading this Jesus is Lord Jesus is our Savior Jesus Christ died On The Cross for our Sins God wants a Relationship with y’all God Wants y’all in Heaven and always remember “I Can do all things through Christ who Strengthens Me” Ask God for a Relationship and ask For Forgiveness God Loves Y’all pray for your Friends and Family and Spread The Gospel and the word of God. God Bless 🙏🏽 Philippians 4:13✝️

This isn’t cute. A woman can be so beautiful with 0 self worth. This is what it takes to have a man?Texting all your friends, and she says I don’t care. Wtf
So VERY pretty and talented!

I realize a lot of yall jamming but not really understanding the lyrics... she's basically saying she don't wanna be in a serious relationship... kinda like a friends with benefits. She don't want none of the fake shit that comes with a relationship
This song goes hard. So proud of Queen❣👏

This is what women have settled for...yikes.
w“For YHWH so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:  I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one  jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,  and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of  heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be  called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew Chap 5  no matter what you've already done the messiah's sacrifice makes you totally clean when you accept the messiah as your lord you gain total access to heaven there is a specific plan for you prepared by God if you have any questions about it do a simple test ask God to show you that He exists and loves you

Queen we need a Christmas CD this year. Cone through with the hit Christmas songs Queen.
Queen has a beautiful voice!  Yes she definitely does, and has it going on.
That Sunny Side up egg was done perfect.   I don't even eat eggs anymore, but that one sure looked good.
Donell Jones "This luv" I like the blends👍
Glowing growing so proud of her
This video just made me love the song even more 😭😭
Funny how some people want to complain about lyrics for a song and want to start preaching. Where was this energy for the 90s R&B that was talking about being side chicks or sleeping with somebody else’s man, such as My Little Secret, by Escape. Nobody forcing you to like the music but let’s not be hypocritical and reaching for something that’s  just music and to be used as entertainment. In no way does liking or listening to the song glorify cheating or being unfaithful. She’s singing about realistic situations that people have dealt with and can relate to.
If theres Anybody that will give my Music a chance ill definitely appreciated . Im on all Streaming platforms including Youtube . Thank you My music Head family 😎 -Doughjay Davon
Queen I love you your like one of my favorite artists but honestly wasnt feeling this one 🙁
She has a beautiful voice and I am here for her and her music! 💜💙💚💖💘💝

chris punching air right about now
Durkio🆘💯
Lil Durk is fire asf but queen dayummmmm 🔥🔥 she looking good fr
Damn Clarence cheating on her now damn Queen wyd
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism

Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16

This whole song toxic ... and I love it 🥰
Yeah Chris real hurt😂🌚
I made this after i caught my wife cheating with my brother 😥😡 https://youtu.be/7XYMBvONoT0
I bet India feeling someway😂😂😂
queen gave me NuNu vibes
Title Airport ?More like jimin's fashion runaway:  https://youtu.be/olkH5kXgI80
Shittt go crazyyyy
Love this song it’s a whole vibe
Can we all give 2pac his credit tho .
Hoping somebody explain to me the video I don't get it
I like the melody but not the message.
I love Queen! Been rocking with her since the beginning of her YouTube days! She really can sing!! She my fav out of this new generation of female r&b! People be trying to knock her down but I’m glad she’s on the right path. Wish nothing but success and happiness for her❤️.
Everybody keep saying they hear 2pac and Donell Jones. More like the Debarge's A Dream that's that real music. Old school music will always live on. And some of y'all don't understand the song it's a dream that shes selling I love this song it's fun and catchy great tune also I will never let a dude lie to me willingly (because that is clearly not good love duh!) but the dream is the idea of this perfect illusion of being the only girl who a guy holds closest to his heart.
MY JAM 🎶❤🎶❤
Why does this beat sound like “Biggie, give me one more chance” or is it just me?
.
Queen done got thicker ooowee
Dope 🔥
Chequen el cover que acabo de grabar de nuestra Diosa Lorde, espero que me puedan apoyar regalándome un like y una sucripcion! Xoxo ❤️ https://youtu.be/et3rvO_fKm4

Jesus Christ the lord of lords and kings of kings🤞🏽 died on the cross for everyone’s sins nothing can keep you from his steadfast love and he will forgive you for any sins you have committed but you have to come to him with a sincere heart genuinely wanting to be saved and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost how to be saved? read Corinthians 15 that’s the gospel....gospel means-good news the good news is what Christ’s did for us on the cross and GODS grace he’s kindly given to us Jesus return is near be saved before it’s to late🙌🏼❤️ the “mark of the beast” system is being setup watch my video on my channel

Whatever sin your going through whether it’s fortification, adultery, demonic music (rock and roll, urban music, sad music, and artist who sold their soul to the devil), stealing, lies, homosexuality,praising idols ( celebrities, artist, and etc) , false god, new age, and anything that is against Gods commandments ask for forgiveness. The devil likes to get into your mind with lies, whatever is impossible for the world is possible for God. Believe that Jesus is your lord and savior and he died on the cross for all of these sins. One sin isn’t worse than the othe because if it was then Jesus crucifix was for nothing. In John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. This means that when you believe in him and spread the Gospel and do what is ask of you. You will not fear death because you will enter the Kingdom if God. Jesus loves so much and don’t let him down for he believes that you may all can come live with him in heaven if you just take your cross and alter. Meaning you sacrifice what God doesn’t like of you to have, do or say and walk in the Holy Spirit as he will guide you for what is wrong and what is right. Amen.
If you want to be happy or have peace in your life, you should give your life to Jesus. This is the day the lord has made and we should enjoy and be glad in it. God has given us many things and we haven’t appreciate it by being thankful and even praying (talking to him). If you love God and want to make things right in your life he will reward you with many blessing with a good prayer life like praying 3 times a day. Ask for forgiveness ( come from the heart not just to be justified) , ask for what you need like wanting to be like Jesus and be thankful for the good things that are going on in your life. But you also have to drop all the things that the devil has power over like jewelry, make up, fake hair, fake nails, jeans, leggings, revealing clothing.
This the one 🔥🔥🔥
Banga!!!!!!!

God bless you all. God loves you and so do I. I beg of you to please repent and turn away from your ways. Accept Jesus Christ as your LORD and Savior and watch your life transform for the better. Please take heed of this you’re not reading this by accident, please do this now, no day is promised.❤️

Honestly I miss these kind of music videos, you watch it and it actually matches the song. These days its eyes rolling in the back of heads, optical illusions, smoking mirrors,snake here, scorpion there, and incomprehensible mumbles, lol. I like how HUMAN this music video is!

Yes queen I’m so happy for you ❤️❤️
I miss the days when you could scroll the comments and see legitimate opinions and things you could agree to or elaborate.  That cool moment when someone types a paragraph of analysis and you learn something about the video or concept.  I love how the internet has grown, but it would be cap to say I don't miss some of the old days.
I don’t like this song but durk is on it so I’ll listen to it, it’s just queens voice don’t sound right on it but he should have put summer walker on it
I like the way she is singing to all lildurk's lyrics 😩
YALL ARE SLEEPING ON QUEEN !
All the artists these major labels promote look and sound the same.

Queens moving up
Lil Durk is handsome..my old ass!
YESSSSS QUEEN DO YA SH!T BABYYYY
I know the person reading my comment will be a multimillionaire one day in Jesus name
I'm loving this vibe she giving in this video ol skool vibes mixed with new skool spin on it and I love it.😍😍😍
Got hip hop n trap beats for any new rappers
Durkio🔥🔥
Don’t like it... needs lil work on lyrics n flow
This is a bop! ❤️
now i see why  albums be  taking so long the clearance samples alone
This remind me of that one 2 pac song
I bet you after this video  lil durk gonna try to hit with her🤦‍♂️
This song is dope😩😩😩😩
I love the crispness of the video!!! Love it
Here for durk 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
All the dislikes are all the people that got lied to in a relationship.
One man for me and I'm the only one for him. Having a husband who loves you unconditionally, a Man of God is the best thing I could ever ask for. Once I got married to my bestfriend I realized... being single sucks lol Nothing compared. I mean being single is nenessary in finding the right guy God wants for you but still. Never going back lol🙏🙏🙏✝️✝️✝️
She hasn’t made a song i don’t like yet!
Fucking with it and my God she’s so gorgeous and underrated
I’m very proud of queen 👑 she staying consistent
This song screams toxicity with a cute melody 😦💀💀💀 this that what's understood need not be explained mess
I got a a lot of favorite songs but this right here 👆🏿 my shit 💜
Clarence cheating 😭
This a Tupac sample which makes me like the song even more 😂
Every new song she's on is better than the last. Her growth is so inspirational and her story says a lot about the company you keep.
Let get a remix without lil durk
Idk I ain’t feel this one. Maybe I’m poor
Why it say ft lil durk twice
I felt this. And honestly lillildurk is not needed
young this is her best song yet. she is so fuckin pretty and talented and RAW
DURK ATE TS UP POINT !!!!!
This is firee 🔥

Durk w his nails done periodt
The video give me Kelly and nelly dilemma vibes! I love it!
Another Teyana Taylor production❤
Can't wait rap in english version!!!
Queen- i think it would be a great idea if you guys would  threw CJ a little Welcome back get together when CJ gets home.  Maybe each of you could buy him a little something. That includes Lee, Mod,  Clarence and you. Maybe you could make him a little cake and get some ice cream.   The other day he was crying at Chtlris's house in the bathroom.  Chris's brother had to  hug him and rock him to get him to stop.  He didn't want to be seen  crying on camara.  Chris's brother would never 😤 really let CJ say what he was upset about.  I do  know that CJ sleeps with Chris and his girlfriend.  And I'm pretty sure there is no set bedtime there. It seems kinda cramped. Love you.
why didn't you sing this song when Chris cheated on you. -.-"
Queen vibe is just DIFFERENT 🔥🔥
YOU LOOK STUNNING IN THE VIDEO QJEEN

I met my Husband when i was 25, We both knew we wanted kids and we knew we needed to get started soon. So i decided to go for fertility test and get some basic testing done, when the result came out my report was totally discouraging, my doctor told me that probably my only chance to get pregnant was to use a donor egg. I was absolutely shocked, we hadn’t even started trying yet, and all of a sudden I was told that I had absolutely no chance of getting pregnant on my own, my head was full of terrifying thoughts like I wouldn’t ever be a mother etc. But luckily my beloved, i found dr emuakhe spell and herbs whose contact was shared on Fertility blog. He is in West Africa and the charges for the herbs was so sweet and more than acceptable for me, the herbs was sent to me in few days and i followed the simple steps and i was confirmed pregnant a month after using the medication. I want everyone desperately in need for a child to contact him on this info,WhatsApp contact number +2349077685681 or visit his Instagram page via @dr_emuakha. I spent less money than planned, you gonna get the best from him. Thanks.....
The video makes nooo sense but the song is fire

I just got my ex husband back through the help of Dr Vera segi love spells Experts. My husband left me for another woman, This was just 3 years of our marriage. The most painful thing is that I was pregnant with our second baby. I wanted him back. I did everything within my reach to bring him back  but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice than to try it. I messaged the spell caster called dr Vera segi, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before 11 hours. He cast the spell and surprisingly 11 hours later my husband called me. I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said  was that he was so sorry for everything that had happened. He wanted me to return to him. He also said he loved me so much. I was so happy and went to him. That was how we started living together happily again.thanks to dr vera segi . If you are here and your Lover is turning you down, or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact Dr. vera segi for help now..Here his contact, WhatsApp him: +2348051759674  email: verasegispells@gmail.com
Clarence better realize what he have cuhz he cocky as hell like queen aint bad with a slim waist and fat ass

Ok I was into it until I heard the I aint mad at cha beat  and then the donell Jones lyrics and melody .  I miss OG music queen like butterflies was 100 percent original ❤️ I need that !!!  FYI I’m not a hater just a fan with an opinion .  Love the video queen  you look great.
🔥🔥🔥 IT'S A HIT!!!
I'm so glad I've been her #1 of her supporters, I've witness her come up. I'm so proud of her, she's just glowing ❤
Durk been going crazy lately on his features he must lower his price or sum💯😂
This video confuses me
Queen is talented and humble 🇹🇹🇹🇹🧡

I don't like it. I think they coulda done alot better. Her verses mostly .
Yess girl you look so good😍💖
I love how she used the beat from Blackstreet “Don’t Leave Me”. Then used part of the lyrics from Donnell Jones “This Luv” for the chorus. Teyana Taylor is definitely putting her on with these videos. Dope song 🔥🔥🔥
If you listen to A reece you know wassup! Mgani wame beat lol😂💥💥

Real ones know she referencing “this luv” by donell Jones

Put your absolute trust in the LORD. He will never stir or lead you in the wrong direction. Understand and know that he knows what’s best for you so don’t do your own thing/way. He won’t fail you nor will he forsake you. So just trust and believe in him with all your heart, soul, and might and watch him transform your life. ❤️Proverbs 3:5-6 “Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. [6] In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your path”❤️
Queen looked 🔥
Straight 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Young Queens, don’t let the beat and melody confuse you. DONT EVER settle like these lyrics say. If a MAN can’t be faithful to you then he isn’t worth your love. Young Men. Don’t let the pretty models and this video confuse you.  Make a commitment to yourself that you will treat Women like you would want someone to treat your Daughter, Mother, Grandmother, Sisters Aunties etc. A real Man is a Man of discipline. Save all that swag shit for your wife when you are loving, providing, protecting her like no other man can. Thats REAL MAN energy.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been following Queen for as long as I could remember & it truly sucks seeing her do a song like this. That she’s okay with being cheated on.. she deserves so much more than that and then some! She’s a real trophy 🏆and should be treated as one & not settle.. js @queennaija js
GOOD VIBES HERE... GUARANTEED YOU'LL LIKE MY MUSIC 🎶🎶🎶🎶
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*

What is the name of the original, it’s killing me
Nobody pays for samples in songs, but I know where it came from. And the line in the song came from a different song- same group. I feel old noticing it. It did sound good tho.
Can’t wait to see her accepting awards at the Grammys
💖💖
Really good song 🎧
I get lost in how beautiful her voice is but I don’t know wtf it’s going on are they promoting toxic relationships?😭 please don’t promote low self-esteem and low self-worth... I am CONFUSION 😫
🔥🔥🔥❤️💚queen💪🏽
Literally 99% won’t see this but bless you and stay safe I’m struggling to hit 2k with notis 🔔

Everytime i see queen I’m just so proud..My Libra sis ❤️❤️❤️
Can we officially say Queen and Teyana Taylor is a great duo
She so cute 😍
The first “ All this loveee “ gives me goosebumps, queen did her thangggg!!!!!
The fact is yes she can sing but on the songs that she has dropped she is not SANGING the way she knows she can. This girl has vocals on her but she is talking with basic melodies in these songs. Queen please hit them notes im tired of these talking songs i wanna hear your vocals reach the sky u know u can do it. Im not hating at all i actually like u. But u dnt need me to like u my opinion means nothing. But as a person who buys ur music i would like to hear sone SANGING from my favorite artist. You can sing draw hella funny and ur pretty girl go off god is watching. He told me to tell u this. Sending smiles your way 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
dope ass collab !!🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Queen slaaayyy❗❗❗
QUEEN gon be mainstream soon watch

Another hit I love it Queen
2/22/11 From The Lord, Our God and Savior The Word of The Lord Spoken to Timothy  For All Those Who Have Ears to Hear   Thus says The Lord: Did you think My wrath would tarry forever? Did you think My judgment sleeps? Are My eyes closed to all these atrocities committed upon the earth, day and night without ceasing?! Are My ears also stopped from hearing? Lo, I have seen and I have heard!... My face draws near to this earth, My eyes are filled with fire and fury! My forehead wrinkles and is set hard against you, O inhabitants of the earth, for it is time!  It is time to shake the cities of men by measure, and to bring up wrath from beneath! City by city shall be punished, one here and another there! Behold, it shall come upon them suddenly, and men shall fear, and with great perplexity shall their hearts fail; a great trembling shall now come upon all people!... THE TERROR OF THE LORD IS AT HAND![1]  It shall come in swiftly, and you shall not know from where it shall come! It shall come upon city after city without warning, for I have caused the earth to become angry! Lo, the depths of the earth tremble at My nearness, and soon this planet shall rage!... It shall rage against you, O deceitful generation! It shall devour and consume this generation, scouring from the earth all man has made! The Scriptures do not lie! And My prophets speak, yet the people refuse to hear; they will not listen! Even My own people will not believe! Yet their belief is not at all required. For My will is set and can in no wise be turned back.  The truth of My Word stands; it speaks throughout the generations and echoes throughout eternity! For I am The Lord, YAHUWAH, I am EL Shaddai, and I shall surely perform all I have spoken! I shall not cease, nor relent, nor shall I be turned back from My purpose!... The kingdoms of men must die, and the evil of men must be destroyed; all must be wiped away! Peoples of the earth, you have hated life, you have polluted My garden! Diseased and awful generation, you have destroyed the garden! And so I am come to cleanse, and to wipe away! I am come down, My face is very near! Do you feel the heat of My wrath, O ignorant and vain peoples?! You retain no knowledge at all! Only greed and wickedness, wickedness upon wickedness, passes before your eyes without ceasing, and oh how you love to have it so!  DEAD GENERATION, YOUR HEARTS ARE STONE! Day after day you build up wrath, the vessels overflow! Day by day, the bodies are stacked up in heaps! Day by day, the unborn are slaughtered, whole generations of people murdered without cause, multitudes of innocent cast off as refuse! Yet you think Me too harsh, and My punishments too severe, My judgments unfair.   I AM THE LORD, AND THIS IS MY EARTH!  THESE ARE MY CHILDREN!...  All you see, from the ground beneath your feet  To the farthest reaches of the universe, is MINE,  And I shall do as I please!...  I shall do according to the counsel  Of My own will,[2] for I am God!   Therefore, O peoples of the earth, because you have slaughtered the innocent and murdered your neighbor, lo, you have even made for yourselves laws that all may do their pleasure in unrighteousness and perform evil at their leisure, so then shall I also declare MY Law, and it shall fall hard upon the backs of all nations! Yea, I have put forth the decree and hasten to carry out your sentences, O peoples of the earth!  And what is the sentence, you ask?... Look upon the slaughtered innocent! Look upon their torn and broken bodies; behold how they are torn in pieces! See how their blood pours down and their limbs are strewn about! LOOK! Look how they are scraped out of their mother’s womb! Look upon the works of your hands, you evil and most wicked generation! LOOK UPON YOUR WICKEDNESS! LOOK UPON ALL YOU HAVE DONE!  Thus says The Lord God, Creator of Heaven and Earth: Because of this blood which remains on your hands, because of all the multitudes of slain you have piled up in heaps, because of the evil works of your hands in where you have agreed together, to both do and allow them, to make them law, THUS SHALL I IN LIKE MANNER DO UNTO YOU! IN LIKE MANNER SHALL YOU RECEIVE AT MY HAND! Lo, even double shall you receive at My hand, and double again, until there is no place found that is not laid waste, until every land is polluted by the stink of rotting corpses! Both man and beast shall lie down in death together; they shall be as refuse upon the land! I shall tear down your cities and break apart all your dwelling places! I shall tear your leaders in pieces and pour out the blood of your mighty men upon the ground, until it reaches unto the neck![3]  Behold, all mighty and evil men shall be torn in pieces, with their limbs strewn about in the open fields and in the waste places![4] Behold, the great army, the astonishing company, the assemblage of nations who have come together to fight against The Holy One of Israel,[5] shall be broken in pieces without hand! For strong is The Lord, and sharp is the sword which proceeds from His mouth![6] Behold I, even I, The Lord of Hosts, shall scrape every last vestige of man and his inventions from the earth at the last day! For I am God, and the glory of My strength is revealed in My Holy One!   The glory of men must die! Declares The Lord of Hosts,  The Only Creator, The God of Israel...  YES, I AM HE, YAHUWAH!...  Hurry now, those who hear! Hurry now, those who know Me!  Hurry and kiss The Son![7]  Hurry now and kiss Me upon My face,  All you who know My name!...   YAHUSHUA-YAHUWAH!  https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Glory_of_Men_Must_Die
Why they put his name twice. 🤣

Queen steals my heart always ! 💚💚
Can’t wait to see the BTS

Don’t care for her music, but this was actually nice and cute
Queen did it again I love you as a person and artist keep shining.  I love this song will be adding to my play list.
I ain’t know about credit so I tried to buy her ass with Obama care 😂😂
RIP Eddie Van Halen
Wtf is this garbage? Why was it on my feed? The guy rapper can't even pronounce the letter S, he says SH instead cause of the stupid fake grill in his mouth and the main girl is fat and singing about how she's ok with being cheated on as long as it's not with her friends? Wtf is music coming to? You kids are dumb
She walked on this again like cmon yo
she got star power... need that album! keep up the great work Queen!

I love how she sending the message to little girls around the world that it's okay to be cheated on as long as it's not done with her friends in the man comes home to her the f*** is wrong with this world
🔥🔥🔥#Fightagainstevilfilms
Lil Durk my favorite rapper, and one of the top 3 in the game, cant tell me different
Yasss Queen !
Love
why durk low-key remind me of fetty wap on this
This song is fun. This is fun too: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.katerini.mandelaeffect
I like this song, but the treatment for this video could have been wayyyy better! Anywho, waiting for the album for sure ❤️
Lil Durk really said I tried to buy her ass with Obama care  2 libras on one song  it’s lit🔥🔥🔥 team libra lol
I’m so happy for her 💓 she deserves every blessing coming her way!
girl power who with me
This is a representation of dreams come true.. I get emotional on all her videos seeing how far she’s come and has proved everyone wrong 🧡🧡🧡 #Queentober
https://youtu.be/ih8-4FxfkhQ
This bih hard asf🤣🔥
Who put the title 😂😂😂 why durk Feature twice 🤦🏽‍♂️
VOCALSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🔥🔥
Been following her for a long time. I dont deny shes beautiful and has God given talent. Ive just been disappointed seeing her fall into the world's ways. Everyones goal now is to basically look like each other, clones. Children of God are separate. Seeing her getting surgery, contouring her face. I love her natural beauty better, it is God given. Im sorry she wasnt happy with it. And i do expect hate from my comment, but i just had to say it.
I love thisss😍😍😍😍😍😍
This whole video is a vibe 🔥
Song high key ight!😍
Refreshingly classy 👏
I'm sending you virtual hugs to anybody that needs it! Stay safe everyone and stay positive.
When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, show life that you have a thousand reason to smile:-))))
Damn!! 😍🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️

BBBBBB******* This is so cute honestly my favorite thus far
Another one of those lame mumble rappers who have no talent😂
Please y’all get Queen a choreographer she to bomb not to be dancing in her videos. She would shut the game down. Teyana Taylor needs to be her dance teacher/choreographer. They already have good vibes together.like this comment up if you agree.
Can we get a clarencenyc reacts to this asap! 🔥🔥👑

JESUS IS COMING Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #goodnews

Jonny Lang's song is better...
Queen is determined to look just like all the rest of these IG thots.
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭KJV‬‬ REPENT AND BELIEVE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU MISS CHRIST YOU MISS FORGIVENESS AND ENTER INTO A DEVILS HELL.
Mannn her music is just🔥🔥🔥😻
yessss , the collab i needed
Auto tuned garbage
its the Glow and growth for me 😍😍
When you're weak and stay with a cheater, but try to make it seem like a strength.  If he cheats, he's trash and you kick him to the curb where trash belongs.
Am I tripping or in durks first scene doesn’t that look like the room from My Beyoncé?
It's Queen Naija's wink for me 1:50
The Ethiopian calendar shows this year is 2012. The Mayans were correct.  Give your life to christ. Witchcraft, celebrities, your idols and opinion will not save you. These storms are warnings from the TRUE God and creator. These things will not improve. Time to repent is coming to a close. Soon the unimaginable will happen. Do it today. These warnings will run out and the opportunity as well.
And They Thought She Was Gon Be Repetitive ? STOP SLEEPIN ON MY GOOD SIS QUEEN.

Queen has come a long way she looks so happy and also working with big name artists . Her career is going day by day.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Real talk tho I hope this not the standard you all putting out there for women of tomorrow to look up. Real talk anything but the truth in a relationship is mediocre! #4DQueens
Gurl you shoulda done this on your own. His part was joke. Ruined the song for me. Women you don't need a man in your videos. Next
I read his name as lil dick and I read the title as lie to my feet lol 😂          My brain is so fucked lol
Damn I love her ❤️❤️
Dope 🔥
I thought of Tupac for a sec cause of the beat🤧... but this song🔥🔥🔥
Lil durk is doing the most these days...he is on another grind!!big ups
Good 😌 song Queen😍

Ahh straight level up she got T Taylor directing her music video, on point! Stay true to your Almighty Creator and yourself Queen!
🔥🔥🔥
HEAT 🔥🔥
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
I can’t wait for the album 🔥🧡
❤️
I like how they sampled Pac's song I aint mad at ya
Durk uo a real life goat 🐐

Hey random person scrolling down the comments..      Have a wonderful day  :)
This song def going on repeat🔥🔥🔥
Love ittttt
PACE YOURSELF   Isaiah 26:4 Biden could have unloaded all of the folly that Trump has done over the years; in between and around the structured questions of the moderator of the debate, in one go. But he, and I guess his team, needed to pace themselves. So if Trump ever comes back to the table Biden still has a lot of arsenal left for him, although Trump has pre-emptive strikes of folly of his own to try and obfuscate and confuse us. On a different note the devil knows us better than we know ourselves. He knows our weaknesses. He paces himself but we can pace ourselves too because he is a liar all we need to do is just take the opposite of anything he says (this goes for the world and the flesh too). Our enemies will try and obfuscate and confuse us too but don’t let them. JESUS has paced to you for perfection in paradise in the present.
I bet the shoot was fun

Video was fire

Nice song and video. Reminds me of "A Dream" by Debarge. I might have been born in 1992, but I listened to old school music. "Don't Leave Me" by Blackstreet and 2Pac "I Ain't Mad At Cha". These songs sampled Debarge song.
it’s durk for mee😫😫
I'm tryna figure out what the sample is

Mood: 🥺🤍
“ Cumming back to back she hitting goals that she ain’t reach yet” I loveeeeee this song 😍🎧
Here before a Milli!
Just my opinion I would of loved to see Lloyd on this
You should make a song with lil baby and nba youngboy
so y’all asking to get clapped & lied to now .. ion wanna hear a damn thing from now on 😂
Durk is that guy
Wow that auto tune is so talented!
i love this song i  wish was just like you
_I hope that whoever is reading this becomes successful in life ☺ stay safe and stay happy_
Yeah this video and song a fuckin vibe🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m not feeling chicks words talking about “You don’t care if this MF steps out on you and as long as he don’t fuck your friends you gonna hold all your love for him”GIRL now you about to have these young dumb mfs thinking about trying som silly shit like this on our young vulnerable ladies. oh hunny idc how much somebody paid me or what they was offering I would never speak no sh like this, you got these young girls watching and listening to y’all’s music so now your about to corrupt our young girls thinking it’s ok for a MF to step out while you be a good girl sitting at home saving yourself for him he’ll no girls do not believe that. KNOW YOUR WORTH!!!  But on another note your voice is beautiful and song or not you shouldn’t be saying shit you don’t mean because words are powerful girl an plz believe it’s true when they say “What you put out in the universe/world is exactly what your gonna get” even thinking shit can be your reality and that’s some shit we all need to be thinking about . But if you really do feel like this then girl we need to sit down and talk because your worth is so much more and you deserve to be treated as a queen. Maybe get some counseling look into co dependency! Idk but something’s gotta change with that mentality and it’s gotta start with you, what you tell yourself.   But if I’m doing to much by saying to much then my bad y’all! Aha love the song though .. Durk you got that voice baby 💋
Goin brazy queen I see u 🤣🤪🤪
Dang you see that booty pop @ 3:12 queen lookin good !!!😘😘😘
ITS THE LOOKS FOR ME !!! YASSS SIS LOVE THE SONG 💕 Yass AUNTIE for the VISUALS 🧡🧡🧡🧡💕💕💕💕

Perioddddddt a fucking Queen in the making❤️
Yooo I fw this song fr fr💯
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
LOVE ITTTTT
🎵🎵🎵
This is it !!! 🥰🔥🔥
Queen you should work on your stage presence. Her dancing, gestures, & movements come across stiff & awkward at times. It seems like she's not confident & it shows in her performances. Hire a choreographer or someone to show you how to be more natural & relaxed in videos, interviews, on stage etc. Alot of new artists get training & coaching on how to perform...no hate, you're a talented singer Queen, just an observation.
greatttt jawn! <3
I saw like durk I was like a wha-
Yes my babies do it 🌹❤️
It’s PAC for me✅
This might be my new fav !!!
LOVE IT
black atlass ........

Vocal for days ❤️queen❤️
I love the ratchet version of Queen
Clearance so lucky 🤪🤪🤪
Yurr
Behind the scenes 🥰🤩🔥
Love it😍😍😍
Queen can sing, truly! She needs classic hits not these popular toxic bops. Only a certain demographic wants to sing these lyrics, love me good and lie to me. With all that raw talent and emotion she could sing way more relatable songs on this same beat and it would be magical. Also, I’m calling it, people sick of the auto tune. We miss straight vocals, she actually has the talent to deliver them. Give it to us, with this nicely shot video, and nice beat and boom, MAGIC.
🦅🔥
Remember when you said SQUEAKER could beat up KING SO?😂 that’s tuff
Durk should’ve made this song alone
Only came for durk
Queen is makin shit shake and I’m here for it🤟🏾😭
OKAYYY queen just coming upp everytime i blink
But a man can't marry more than one woman????? Fjfjfkfkdldhdkdkdfk y'all slow fr

This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.

♥️LOVE IT ♥️💛🔥💛🧡💥🧡 #FIREBANGER
Queen deserves more recognition
I love this soooooooong!!!❤❤❤❤
what i can say is she is the only YouTuber/singer, rapper that is steady making songs back two back like she really on her grind like forreal though all serious like a this point she ain't worrying about NOTHING IN THE WORLD but herself her music and pursuing her music and all i gotta say about that is that i luv her and she's beautiful, gorgeous, fine, an amazing person and much more that i can't explain RN but u should know the rest though right.
queen and pnb rock would be 🔥! like if y’all agree!
Love it queeenn yasssss !!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️🎁🎁
Queen, you did the damn thing 🔥!
I don't get why all these songs be getting dislikes 🤦🤦🤦🤦 Jobless People 🤣

She’s so awkward with her hands 😭

Fire
Queen Queen Queen🔥🔥🔥
Its the "Donnell Jones - All This Luv" plug for me
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Song Gets Better And Better The More You Listen To It Go Queen! 👏🏾❤
That was fire 🔥
Queen did that
QUEEN NAIJA is that you you go girl love the song ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥 she can sing no body can say anything
Omg my new song finna be on repeat
Durk fine fine tho 😩
The right back beat from boogie was definitely the right beat for this song just fire🔥
Any artist with a platform that just sang about God always gets the come up because the cabal does not want Christian voices to reign in the industry. Queen Naija did an amazing job with 'War Cry'. Anyways, still and always will be a fan of her talent. Just a shame that that's the way it is. (Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce, Katy Perry, Justin Beiber, Tori Kelly, Koryn Hawthorne, praying for Kanye)
THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM SO STRONG I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT “CLAREBEAR” 😫❤️💕 GO SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR SUM HEAT 🔥

💘Gooooood Video Queen💘 😚Your Absolutely Beautiful😚 💣Makeup Sooo bomb💣 Hope u have a Bless Week 😇😇Stay Safe Too😇😇
I do not know that guy who was in the Jeep but damn he better looking then Clarence. I honestly feel Queen Naija deserves better than Clarence that’s my opinion if you don’t like it read past The comments. Btw even if I ever had a chance to be with him I would pass not my type at all. If you reply with some dumb shit I am not going to entertain it because I really don’t care what other people think and that’s just me. I love Queen Naija. You deserve way much more because you are The definition of pure love. I’m proud of you and you are doing an excellent job I understand you have a relationship with Clarence but to be honest with you you deserve better than him I’m keeping it 1000% with you baby girl not even 100%. I know you’re really really smart but remember don’t let a man get too comfortable with his surroundings that he slips up, you know what I mean.
I fuckennn love it 😍 yasss queennn 🔥  Gives me 2000’s vibes 💗💗
Bad asfuckkkkk😍😍😍😍
