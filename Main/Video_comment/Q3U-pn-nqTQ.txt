I love this new hype house era!
Bro I am so proud of him for putting in the effort that he puts into these video's
5:17
Why did Jacob day look at me
I love how Jacobs hair is a different colour in every video
I swear if Paige or/and Jacob leave hype house will be done
I swear the new hype house is so funny but I still miss the old one
Hi
im 14 and i want to become a tiktoker. i dont know how. i already have 611 followers. i was wondering how to get into the hype house when im 18. my goal is 1 million by the time im 18. i love yall so much and u are my insporation
Dude we’re twins. I almost cut the tip of my finger completely off too! Except you could see the bone (somewhat)
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS JAKE LOOKS LIKE  SEBASTIAN CROFT FROM HEARTSTOPPER ???
i love yalls videos sm idgaf if anyone calls me cringe😭😭
OML ace….that noise 😳🤭
Make one for jacob!!!!!
I’m such a huge fan also this is my dads account but I like the way u guys do stuff and u make everyone so happy
Jacob looked jealous when Paige was talking about Kristina girlfriend on ringer
wow                                                    wow
I love The new hype house so much
She got spOOns in her pocket 😭😭😂
Is Paige actually leaving???
the way Thomas was like "BUT I didn't! And that's all that matters here!" LIKE Your finger almost fell off dude 😆😂
His reaction when tab said she was expecting lol
5:26 LMFAOOOOO BRO
Hi
2:50 why do you always make them sit in the back and this hype house era is the best out of all them
ok you can’t tell me this isn’t the best hype house era
puthy
dang the application is real
0:40
I’m going to miss her!!!
How Jacob was when he heard page was gonna leave 🥲
I remeber the FBI open up prank you did on nick back then. I think it was nick
Oh Thomas be safe! Always hurting yourself
Ok Christian looks like Archie Andrews from riverdale
She was one of the best things for Hype house ~ will miss her comical relief.
Could you buy the biggest pool Floaty in the world and test it in the pool?
Jacob was jealous🫢 2:52
I have idea so you know how everyone is shipping Paige and Jacob they should do a prank of faking a relationship and being nice to each other
Random but you should redo the kidnapping video but on the new hype house members
Can you please post again your videos are always a good and more Jacobday
Hey Thomas and can we be friends ♥️♥️♥️
I actually love you guys so much
I love this and how happy everyone one looks but I’m gonna miss her but I’m happy for her!
What is up with your hair dude..
Uffffffffffffffffffffff https://youtu.be/7Icb-HAgbDc
Another day, another trash YouTube recommendation. Just when i think ive turned off the recs for this shit content another garage heap appears in the feed. Cant wait for the day when this type of non sensical stuff dies out because it is the most useless thing humans ever produced.
I have unhealthy obsession with Jacob😅
I hope you guys still friends I’m gonna miss her😭
I  am 😔  because she left  the hyep house
Love how mature Thomas is in how he handles these situations - he deserves way more props and respect from the ppl that come through Hype House
Love u guys so much ❤️❤️❤️
Where do you take someone who has been injured in a Peek-a-boo accident?      To the I.C.U.
Here they go w/ this fake crying
ok i might be dumb but is michael still in his relationship 🧐
Honestly I’d love if Netflix made a season 2 and they were in it !
I’m literally the person who made the application of Paige with the feet emojis 😂😂
literally heard your name all the time but I never gave a fuck about the hype house till now. I liked Paige for the Korean representation and it’s so cool to see her in all the content you guys make. I, as a grown 20 y/o woman….. really…. Enjoy your videos…………… <3
wait what about Eddie. didn't he leave too
This hype house made me laugh a bunch, there’s so much funny people! Everyone gets along amazingly, but also fights a lot as a joke lol
https://youtu.be/-qubsMglLlU
https://youtu.be/-qubsMglLlU
I want to see an old hype house reunion, that would be nice
lol bye
This hype house era is prolly the best, the try not to laugh got me choking on my own breath lmaoooo
damn its insane how goofy talentless fools from tiktok are able to live in mansions when someone there whole life working in hard labor can barely afford a house really shows you whats the problem in modern-day economy.
I love how Thomas is so respectful about everything. He really handles the situation to the best of his ability. He is a great person giving people amazing opportunities.  Thomas you deserve the world 🌎 💕
christian is my fav person hes so funny sorry thomas!
Hype house Season 2?
who r u and why r u in my recommended
Bryce was not fucking with you guys in the beginning
Thomas let’s fight
you're my fav don't tell the others!
i did it
Paige might leave 😭
It’s very odd that no one talks to Thomas or Mia form the old hype house
Not Jacob right in our face saying “U should be” 👹 right after Mia’s like “i’m scared” 💀💀💀
We're going to miss her so much ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Jacob looked 7ft tall on the ring camera
This video is the definition of click bait
what about eddie
aw
This was so funny
I love hype house but it needs more girls
bro, the end… i’m gonna cry  out of context but, i love how chase and charli are in the outro still, even with the whole issue going around…
Aww she literally made the hype house fun again
“ShE gOt SpOoNs iN hEr PoCkEt”
So basically she joined for no reason and was gone just as quick as she popped up. Called it.
Today, I was having the worst day at school. And after I watched this video and it made me so happy
She was one of my fav member and im so happy that she is moving into a new chapter in her life
Love the new hype house 2022😍
Ok, I just have to say something is it just me, or is it obvious that Christan and Jacob like Page? I mean when boys are usually mean to a girl it indicates that they like that person right?
Quick question how do you get to the description to sign up to be Bryce‘s girlfriend
Omg I love y’all and the positive energy y’all spread around the internet❤
I LOVE how everyone in this house gets along together so well!<3
I’m gonna miss tab 😭
Imma miss her
the bryce girlfriend application lmao
Lamo u actually linked the application wtf Thomas 😂😂😂 " I can't I love this video
Can I be apart of the hype House on my TikTok in my bio I am going to say  wish I can be apart of the hype house when I’m like I don’t know 18 or something I’m gonna probably move out and join the hype house even though I’m not even famous
You guys have Rilly me
Mia is so pretty
jackson dean ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love you guys <3
i love how he’s posting videos lately keep it up thomasss! i love you all hype house members🫶🏻.

Hello♥️ hope you have a good day♥️
❤❤❤❤❤

"she got spoons in her pocket" that made me laugh so hard for no reason
I am going to miss her so much! But I am happy for her
Ong Tabatha moving out is depressing 💔🖤
I love them so much wow💕 greetings from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷🇵🇷(did my application😉)

I love how Thomas makes sure everyone in the hype house is happy
I love how you try and try to keep the hype house together I love y’all so much 🥰🥰
Hi
I am genuinely going to miss tabatha but she is doing great. Plus Thomas is right they help
If we had to chose 2 people with the nicest smiles it will be Bryce and Jackson...... who agree
Why did Eddie leave ?

I love how much hype house has grown and I love the people that are in it now and you deserve so much following and love for this great content u create for all of us to enjoy ! Thank you Thomas and the Hype House ❤️

I love this hype house with everything bruh
wish they could make a video locking Jacob and Vinnei somewhere.
She got spoons in her pocket had me dying 😂
No because i agree with everyone this is probably the happiest I’ve seen the hype house and I have been here since they started but i love seeing everyone so happy in the hype house. Hopefully we can get a season 2 of hype house
Love yall so much ❤❤❤
I’m so happy that you guys ended things on a good note I thought they were not gonna address it

I love the new hype house it so funny and nice
Not me just filling it out bc I got nothing else to do😁
Is there anything Ace and Bryce wouldn’t argue over when it comes to pool? 😂❤️
Crying
Why is Eddie not in any videos??
Love how mature Thomas is in how he handles these situations - he deserves way more props and respect from the ppl that come through Hype House
I dislike ppl that pass through - it’s like they popped in to grab Thomas’ Hype House clout and then left :/
What happened to Eddie???
How do I join the hype house. I would really love to honestly. It's like my dream
Thomas I think that what you do is phenomenal and I hope that bigger and better things come your way , ps I love you so much
I love this new Hype House era!!!! 💗
