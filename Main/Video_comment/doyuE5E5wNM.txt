Great interview as always
The next craze will be flick nose fighting!
Sorry, either you are delusional as fuck because you never knocked him out, ever, you knocked him down you dropped him thats it
Wilder might die against nganu
Bloomberg 🫶🏻
“My African brudda, Naganyoooo!”
Dat white boy whupped deeyontay
I know wilder regrets trying to cherry-pick Tyson furry... he saw a fat over weight white guy, that hasn't fought in years, was going thru metal issues and thought it was going to be a easy fight... little did he know, it was the worst mistake of his boxing career..
Wilder mad that Ngannou did better then him... Ngannou will embraced wilder in a fight...
I believe Wilder knock fury the fvck out on 12th round 💯💯💯
Nate Diaz!!?? He´s a light weight!
I am so happy seeing the bronze bomber speaking with so much happiness. Best interview of him so far.
Ngannyo
This video def made me wanna subscribe 😊
22 second count insane. Joe rogan goes over it
Monster puncher. Say what u want he seems like a loyal dude to those he loves. Hell of an entertaining fighter
Fury is pretty match done as a pro boxer, he is old for an athlete ,
He’s tougher then fury
Wilder did not knock Fury out btw, and that is just Wilder's brain damage talking folks.
I’m going with my white brother
Real OF of the Boxing game ❤
CTE: am I a joke to you?  Dana White: Power slap
Fury won
I love Deontay 💪
Why would he support a guy that he lost multiple times to and support his own sport athlete ?  Lets support the other guy becouse hes " African brother " ... But when you lost you have problem with giving respect back as athlete... cover yourself with excuses time after time..not a champion behavior in my book...
Not gonna lie Wilder vs. N'gannou would be a crazy fight.
All respect to Tyson Fury, but Deontay Wilder made the heavyweight division great again
I ll always respect how he declined millions, i mean millions not to step aside vs fury the 3rd fight
This nigga funny asf tb my african brothaa!😂
Deontays spirit looks a lot more stronger!
Also what is this Nate Diaz talk? Do people not understand weight divisions?
This guy might have the most powerful punch on the planet but his legs are sticks. Stay away from MMA
That man won that fight they cheated that man out of that fight he won that fight I can't believe that the boxing industry result to something of that nature the best man win at the end of the day and the best man was Uganda
❤
Wilder could be a great mma fighter. If they start to promote it like boxing, the UFC would have a hard time to keep their fighters.
Deontay Wilder is an Edo descendant?? 😍That's my brother
This man knocked years off of Furys life in Fury's own words.  I don't think anyone's hit him as hard since. Even Ngannou.
Shows how much he knows about Francis when he can’t even see his last name, right
What do so many people struggle to grasp what a knock-out is in boxing?  If Wilder knocked out Fury then he would have won the fight and would still be champion.
Wow,you can tell wilder do like Naganew.
I don't know how come deontay did not kill fury in the ring.something is off because fury is not that strong
The way he was saying Ngannou 😂 basically said Neganu, they should 1time come back to the motherland and we teach them how to pronounce their original names😅
African brother🎉
Bro he should have got the first fight with Fury by KO.  If we're talking 10 seconds he won.  But it is a "10 count" so it was a slow af 10 count.
TYSON FURY CHEATED!! FTF!!
YOU KNOCKED HIM DOWN ..HE KNOCKED YOUR A... OUT
Its crazy how much bitterness and gentle hate wilder has for tyson fury...   The man upstairs frowns on this...
Aged like fine wine 🍷
If anyone can knock out a diaz it’s def wilder
LeDeontay
Delusional dosser Wilder still believes he KOD Fury when in fact he was KOD😂😂
He’s full of shit he don’t believes anything he says himself
2:16 there you go that explains everything. Racist mfs. This dude still sour AF that a white dude beat that ass. White GIPSY KING destroyed you and your African broda.
Deontay is always proud of his African Edo heritage
Wilder was right!
Kind of weird that it's acceptable to root for someone solely based on their ethnicity. Aren't we all brothers Wilder??
Mma 😂 one kick and his twig leg would snap
Bro said Nate diaz?deontay is 230 pounds😂
This is aged like a fine wine 🍷  Nganou vs. Wilder is going to be a bomb 💣
Now you're looking. A real racist is the auntie Wilder. Hes a hater of Tyson fury cause he knows Tyson fury has whipped his a** 3 times
I saw Fury knock out Wilder  ,he slapped him around like a red-headed step child.
Imagine a white guy saying “I gotta go with my white brother”. The 👨🏿‍🦱community would be up in arms. 🤨
British people hyping up their athletes all the time is always such a cringie thing to watch...
that’s a clean ass chain
Good on wilder for picking Francis "Naganyo" At least his prediction was solid, though.
Very likable guy when he is being himself!
For those who dont understand what Wilders said when he said who was he supporting and he said francis and am Edois a tribe situed in Edo state in Nigeria meaning ,his heritage his is from Nigeria andand Francis is from Cameroon which use to be under the administration of Nigeria before they gave it to France.
Lol wilder thinks he knocked out fury............
"I'm Edo and he's from Cameroon, so we back to back!". This is a man that knows where his ancestors are from, I love that for him!!! You know where your fathers are from, it'll spark a light in you that every adversary will find hard to extinguish.
Now if a white fighter would say they’re going with a fighter because he’s white, he’d be called a racist,right?  Deontay isn’t from Africa so isn’t like he was just picking his country so it was race-based comment.  Keep the same energy, don’t be hypocrits
Wilder got knocked out and knocked down more than fury.
Nice title. Neither of them knocked out fury. Lol wtf
So gracious. Really good interview. Deontay is winning me back after taking the fury loss so poorly. I hope he boxes francis next
Damn, Wilder putting his money where his mouth is!!!! Respect you more now bro ( sry minus all the excuses from your fights,) but respect!
He’s not African he’s a descendant of slaves. Big deference. African and American blacks don’t get along
Man fury really took wilders soul, dude can’t stand talking about him.
Power slap is fing stupid.
He wants to get back to bombing people, his long body would get tied into knots like a pretzel in mma
2:02 man F***k Fury 😂😂 basically what he said
Shocker he picked against fury 🤣
You’re correct cheating fury lost again he was down for 14 seconds and 13 seconds with Wilder and now he lost to Ngannou fury is trash he’ll never beat Wilder in a fair fight
Niether of them knocked tyson out 😂😂😂 maybe knocked him down but not out 😂😂
Silly man very silly
Wilder still upset he lost
This aged like fine wine
Nenganew
Wilder you were robbed but don't worry, we true fans know. The 2nd fight too was a cheat because of Furys gloves. Fury gloves were actually the same way against Ngannou.
First time seeing your platform and I really appreciate you keeping ppl in the loop on wilder. Look at the parrots spewing hate. Interview brought them back with a nasty spirit. Meanwhile we're trying to smile and live it up. Fighting against that energy offline til this day. I love you stay real. Keep reporting on the whole shyt. Lol.
This man is retarded 😮
The soul that lived in that Body called Deontay Wilder is completely gone after fighting Fury. It's not even the same person anymore.
Told everyone francis would do well. Everyone bashed his chance now they all flip and act like they were mates. Says a lot about people's character 🙄many fake follwers and not many honest leaders.
Hes just betting against anyone Fury faces because he has so much pain reflecting on his 3 fights with him. A broken clock is right twice a day.
You knocked him down but he got up and kicked your butt.you just like this guy did you cfeated just like him. Poor baby, you lost and of course both of you were cheated .
Look Fury took a draw and beat you twice.Francis lost the fight.But he did score 1 knockdown .But he lost badly on points.But i think you can take Framcis because your punch is harder than Tyson's.
Francis won clearly tyson is a white gymsy 🤡
Tyson was out of shape. Francis fought a Tyson that didn’t really take him serious.
Bruh you lost to Fury multiple times 😂
The only real boxing match Tyson fury has ever been in was with the guy at the Dunkin donuts drive thru, enough said ..
African Brother???  🦧🦧
Deontay Wilder's one dimensional amateur boxing skills helped Fury hide his boxing deficits for years. The two should go on tour together.
African brother Nigganou
My African brother Nagaiyo!!!
Wilder is such a sore loser. Fury was so knocked out...he got back up and absolutely demolished him for the rest of the round.   Muh costume wuz too heavy and sheeeei   My woter wuz spiked!  Fury's gloves wuz cheating!   Muh coach was on his payroll!!   The count wuz slow
...But he didn't knock Fury out and neither did Francis, pure delusion.
Bro nate is a small welterweight. This guy with the camera doesn't know what the Fook he's talking about.😒
Only man that saw the truth.
Like Bomber but tbf you can't put bass on Toney "just being a one and done guy" when you've yet to hit the cage.
U knocked him out? When was this? 🤣😂🤣😂
Wtf wilder would kill Nate Diaz
Fury beat this guy!
Yea he would go with Francis ofc because hes tired of getting his ass whooped by Tyson Fury lol😅😅😅😅
Love this guy I wish him and fury got along
Dude no u didnt he got up it was a draw 🤷‍♂️ then he beat yo ass twice in a row l bro  two knovkouts 💯🥊
Except you he didnt knock him out, and neither did Francis. And Francis did better than Wilder anyways lol. Also it was Fury that knocked out Wilder, i guess that KO did a lot mroe damage than i thought. Wilder is delusional.
Another bad prediction
What is wrong you mentioning 155lb punch drunk Nate Diaz to fight Wilder in any capacity? All you people who’ve never fought need to wake up and stop supporting these big guy vs small guy boxing shit shows. The Paul brothers are pathetic
Imagine if Wilder was to line up and take his time to bitch slap somebody lmfao I’m rolling around picturing that now 😂
Wilder and Ngannou is going to be another big money fight!
Only boxer to fight a man 3 times,say he had knuckle dusters in his gloves,and call him 'pillow fists'
You knocked him down, not out.
Aka “I’m only going with Francis cause of race” wilder a racist An it’s been easy to see for a while
Wilder vs Strickland next
Les go Nigga Yoooo😂
We love you Deontay ❤❤
What’d he say - he’s Cameroon and I’m what? “ethno”?
I love this, this is very heliruos 😅
I thought Wilder was still sleeping 🤣🤣🤣
Tyson put you to sleep nite nite
Nate diaz naturally weighs 77kg his and Deontay wilder lightest weight he ever fought was 97kg. If he needs to get lighter he'll die 😅 so either deontay has to cut weight until he almost dies. Or nate has to eat till he's fat asf lol.
Got slept and switched to straight up denial when the excuses didn’t work
Very subtle slurring of the words from Wilder
he didn't knock out no one Fury got up and shook it off but this fool got himself knocked out.
What is so special about Nate Diaz that you wanna match him with Wilder?
Im sure it was him that got knocked out
The fact Francis "won" makes it worse for wilder! That was his first pro fight against the guy who beat wilder 3 times! Wilder is still really bitter as hell.. he needs to accept fury is better and Francis would probably beat wilder!...lol. sad little prat..
imagine slap boxing deontay wilder in high school
Wilder is living in delusion. Sad to see, honestly. I hope one day he accepts he lost to a better fighter so that he can move on with his life.
Gonna try n beat up Nate? Not even close to same weight and Nate is old. Man fought at 155 most of his career. Atleast fight a middleweight. Ur 6-7.
Heavy suit. Food poisoning. Voodoo. Weighted gloves 😂😂😂
How tall is the camera man 😂😂😂
Wilder and Ngannou in the cage?
Wilder can learn from Francis
You are a great boxer bro but don’t run your mouth bro 😊 Tyson fury knocks you out three times straight 😢
Let's go nagayoo!
Damn he still got such sour grapes…..shit get over it already and stop being such a sore/poor loser! 🙄
Wilders came correct with the prediction 🔥
Wilder being a politician
Nganouu would beat tf outta wilder
Tyson knockt your bottom lip and u went crashing to the canvas like a little girl lol 😂 nganoue would slaughter you if he can do that to fury
stupid fight they took people for idiots to watch this fight  to make money this is less than exhibition fight all the fighters of UFC want to box because there is less damage and make more money
This guy has to be the biggest sore loser I’ve ever seen in boxing!Just like common people who talk big and are tough until they run into that one person!
Wilder you have to beat Tyson Fury before you do anything else! Maybe you can fight Francis!
Deontay was robbed twice by Fury with the gloves and 11 count Francis just exposed Fury
But wtf is Deontay doing at Power Slap ??🤣🤣🤣 so fkin random 🤣🤣
Fury changed this man.
Big dosser
Bro he bursted your ear lul
Dude shout up 😂 you got knocked out couple of times so please retire.
The only guy to accurately call the fight
Wilder is the THE top sausage I have ever seen.  IN MY LIFE. Sweet lord. Also dressing like a lady makes him so much cooler. Also the fact he can talk such great English is so enduring.  What a top bloke.
I think deonte would give Francis a better match. Deonte needs to fight usyk , I think he's still a champion
Honestly, all of us "delusional  race/ Wilder fans" saw this coming. We've recognized all his tactics. He didn't think he would have to cheat for this one, and he couldnt weight bully Frances, leaving his true fighting ability exposed. Yall now see the kind of protection this man has. Some of us boxing fans have been complaining but now that the world has noticed... maybe now there will be some serious investigations into his past fights.
He was right
I don’t care I know somewhere somehow Deontay wilder was watching this fight 😂 who you kidding champ
When a black guy,says hes going with his african brother its all fun n  giggle but when a white guy says im going with my white caucasian mate hes a racist.
Fury having nightmares about Francis🥊 😂
Time to run it with Francis wilder
Champ your prediction was on point N'gannou won with a Knockdown....💪🏾👊🏾❤️
He should fight Francis.
Wilder is delusional he knocked him down he didn't knock him out pretty sure that fight he got back up and put boxed you to make it a tie and than the next two rematches he literally out boxed you twice and won both time Wilder is the biggest example of a cry baby who can't except he lost to a white man that what it really boils down two
Nate diaz is 170lb put him up vs a heavyweight are u serious 😭
He did not knock fury out he woulda won if that was the case
Now we know about white supremacy in boxing... These judges keep helping Fury!
Francis should've started boxing early, he's 37yo now.😢
Nunganyo 🤣
First time Wilders colour coded prediction came true
your brother beat that fat guy for you 😂
Ngannou did better than Wilder in all his attempts😂 Ngannou would kill this dude
Yall some lier's he absolutely did know fury out Fury just a Terminator
He knew what was gonna happen
Wilder got it right
Wilder almost called it 🤣
Wilder hits harder the fight showed, but francis showed he got better cardio than wilder its wild. Also wilder can beat fury, clear decline
If there is one thing wilder loves it’s violence 😂😂 ofcourse he would Love power slap
Ngannou did better against Fury than Wilder. He is way more talented than Wilder
Wilder if doesn't fight Aj, Fight Ngannou
Clown of a man lol. Got spanked 3 times and the only thing he’s holding onto is I knocked him down lol’ - fury got up and won the fight. What’s his point ?!
💣💣💣💣💣💣💣
Fury is living in his head rent free
And Francis pulled it off
Fury put you to sleep easily
yeah you knock him down but he knocked your ass down and beat you multiple times. He is your daddy like it or not WIlder. LMAO
Well he's right😂
Wilder don't have enough foot movement for MMA
Nate would still submit wilder in mma 🤣
Ngannou knockouts fury the F out
Wilder has a point. He technically did KO Fury just like Tyson KOing Douglas. The ref gave them extra time to recover.
Much love Africa unite🇨🇲🇳🇬🙏🏿🙏🏿❤️❤️
Forget the interview i wanna see wilder in power slap holy shit
WHO here after the fight? 😂
Francis got Robbed and Fury knows it.
francis dropped that man in his debut he got potential
Ngannou would EAT DEONTAY after seeing that performance.
Wilder delluded as allways spoonfed opponents his whole career until he met FURY and fury made him piss his pants
How tf did Francis boxed and almost won against Tyson than Wilder😂
He might of been right. Hed loose against Francis as well
Ngannou won
He really did knock him down
This aged VERY well
😂😂😂 comeing from wilder can u remember when tyson ko u in the ring big hitter my ass more like big dosser 😂😂😂
brain dead  deyonte wilder is.....Tyson really knocked him silly, this is a proof video!
D.W….can’t get rid of all the furry demons in his head still haunts u doesn’t it good he beat u like a drum skippy
U did not knock out Tyson furry he beat u really 3 times skippy ur a has been ur toast
Fucking bum... One trick pony bitch.. You lost deal with it deontay
Guy is still butt hurt he lost twice to Fury. Only reason he'd pick Francis
Lowkey fuck w that matching Ice piece…
This man is literally a cry, baby he got his ass handed to him by the king years ago, and still goes around, holding a grudge thinking the world did him wrong and cheated him so he a black man
u know i mean
🐒 🙈 🙊 🐵 🙉 🐒
Fury got knocked down not out.Idiot.You got K.O’d dumbass
U didn’t knock him out 🤣
this man is the greatest fighter in the history of LIFE!!!😤🥊
the bronze bomber DEONTAY WILDER!!!✊🏿🙌✨👑
lol
fvck what people say! in my eyes your still the GREATEST FIGHTER THAT EVER WALKED THIS EARTH!!!😤✊🏾
God bless u my bro deo. Much love an respect mon frère ❤❤. One Africa one people🥂❤️ respect 🫡
Skulls are pretty hard for a good reason
Forever classless
When you knock him out !! This dude idiot
This man will always be a champion to me you’re such a inspiration and role model
0-3
Fury fans see Wilder interviews and they run to see it! 🤣 Hoping he admits Fury didnt cheat! 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾 Yall are literally mad because this man is living in truth than delusion. Yall probably think its okay for Men to compete with Women. Some shit you just cant make up. 🏌🏾‍♂️🤣
He went from the bronze bomber to the brown pantser.
Nate diaz? Lol 😂
Poor poor loser. Dosser
You loss 3 times vs Fury, shit.
One kick and Deontay's leg is snapped. FYTB MMA 😂
All these Fury boys cant accept that Wilder gave him his toughest fights. Knocked him down a total of 4 times over their trilogy. All other heavyweights have been cakewalks for Fury comparatively
Shut up Wilder ! You remember th pillow feasts that knocked you out two times c’mon man you shouldn’t even open your mouth Night night Fury turned your lights off and ended your career
Fury ended this dude. He had a good run
You'd think he'd know how to pronounce his African brother's name wouldn't you.
Waouhhhhh thanks man
With them spindly toothpick legs he better steer clear of that cage !!
Still salty as ever… Fury got ur number get over it, son !!
Stop the cap 😂
If Ngannou beat fury, That proves that you are just an overrated clown boxer of all time
Trash ass wilder 🗑️
Picking Francis cos he's black. Not suprised. I'm just glad Francis getting a paycheck.
Deontay is nervous of fury
Crazy how much he hates fury he defo hates that a white man beat him 😂
“I didn’t knock him out” = Fix’d Yer Sentence Fo Yuh, Dishes
Fury can fight both on the same knight and knock them out in the same round 😂😂
Wilders a sore loser and pathetic.he never came even close to knocking out fury all he did was knock him down.wilder needs to retire and go away already he's irrelevant
On the evidence if this interview I really think Wilder needs some therapy he is a damaged person. He needs help
I bet you my life he never had nightmares in the first place
Francis Ngannou is basically the MMA version of Deontay Wilder. Not the most technically skilled but has nuclear missiles in the hands.
Spoken like a real rat. You got your A... whopped and instead of giving props to the greatest ever he turns like a rat.
YT folk always hating damn can blk folk show support to each other yall time coming to an end soon
Fury got up like Jason in Mortal Kombat.  Wilder wakes up with wet sheets still.
Is he still bitter and hating? Cuz he should know as a boxer that ngannou doesn't stand a chance..
Of course hes picking francis, ine because he couldnt get the job done and two, he wont support a white guy, just facts
Wilder hit Fury harder than he has ever been hit, for sure. But Fury got back up, all times, and kept on fighting and winning. Fury is as tough as nails inside that ring. I have nothing but respect for Wilder as a fighter, he made it to the 1% in his time. But his inability to admit he lost to the better man is a true show of his colors deep down.
this dumb ass said nate diaz lol WTF wrong division
Memory wipe from fury smacking him in the ‘flace’
one leg kick done
Deontay saying he’s a fan of power slap says it all. Keep doing you pal, heavy weight boxing not for you at all.
Negannio 😂 damn near sounds Italian
Twat used to say he wants to kill someone in the ring.
The 🐐
Wilder is still learning to read
Avoid the cage😅
If a white fighter says he's rooting for his "white brother" people will call it racist
This guy is disgusting.. racist.... to this day...
"I love competing."  Dude has had 1 fight in 2 years, and that was a first round KO.  Does Deontay even want to fight anymore?  He hasn't fought in over a year.  If Deontay steps into an MMA ring, he'll get those skinny legs snapped.
Typical salty verdict 😅😅😅😅
Ko tyson.... Tyson got up an won the round..
Wilder deluded he never knocked fury out..ever. such bitter sore loser
Nobodys gonna talk about how this numbskull is asking about him vs nate diaz??? Tf? Nate competes at 155-170 and wilder is a heavyweight... why would this fool even ask such a dumb question as if it would happen... he couldnt ask about maybe a mid level heavyweight ufc fighter? Im just confused how this guy actually is allowed to ask questions like that. Smh
Wilder got SLAPPED UP BY Tyson
😂 wilders not the sharpest tool in the box is he
Racist
Well he didn't knock out Fury because he got back up
😂
Abit racist from wilders side !!!! But hey nobody says anything 🙄 if the tables were the other way round it would be all over the news
His wife was dying to get on camera 😂😂😂
Omg this guy is little brothering Francis 😂😂😂  You DIDN'T knock out Fury STOP it with your racist bullshit 😂😂😂
Is this wilder guy a ufc fighter or something?
oh delusional CTE wilder what a surprise he cant accept he got his ass knocked out and couldnt get back up lol what a skrub
So he’s choosing francis because he’s a brother, 😂 only white people can be racist of course. Just as biased as haye, clowns
That’s the spirit flower…. Finished isn’t the word, such a bitter bitch!
You knocked him out and he got up and still beat you up and won the round your bum
Nate ain’t even close to heavy weight bro
Wilder would go very far in the MMA. You know why? Because of his power not skills. He doesn't even have any real boxing skills, but that man's power alone can make him a top 5 or top 10 fighter in any combat sport. It's that freaking deadly.
He supports Fransis simply because he's his "African brother" what a racist fool..
☝🏿🤲🏾✊🏾
Who is Ngañyo?? 😂😂
Gotta love this real dude Wilder. Humble and dangerous.
Regardless of what ya say ur think …. He stuck to the code F THE REST..
Naganyah. they just trashed his name
He still mad lmao fury beat him! Stopped him! And Turned him off completely! And let's not pretend like Francis did tell the whole world wilder isn't African he's American!
Wilder is a losing fool.. he did not knock tyson out,just a knockdown 0/3 boyyyyy vs tyson n he got knocked the fk out... blood dripoing out his head thru his ear... didn't knock out sht..pretty much lost every round... stop lying... Of course ngannou... racist pos wilder Hoping someone can beat the man that stomped his azz to the ground 3 times loser boyyyy Wilder  Ps nate would whoop your azz easy I didn't know he was dmb af also not just a loser n racist
Nate diaz wtf 😂
Hahaha Deontay gonna look sick when ufc gives him a paycheck that's 95pct lower than he makes boxing
Wilder is a dawg for going wit his African brother like I am but it’s going to be what it going to be.
Yeap and he still got up and beat your ass off 3 times 😂😂😂
Hes even laughin at his own prediction lol!
Till this day! Till this day!!! 👊💤
lol that means he puts Frans is above him because fury beat Wilder
See this is why people dont like wilder.. Cuz he just picks black people no matter what. Instead of say I think francis can because of power or speed.. He just he black he gonna win
err no you didnt and also you lost 3 times to tyson
Wilder can't have a wet dream now without thinking about Fury , man has F up his head.
Deontay Wilder wouldnt have been in the top 10 in the 80s
Wilder is still claiming he knocked Fury out?! His pride still won't let him except a loss. Sad...
"Newwganyooo" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You didn’t knock him out though… you lost 3 times
Course u would pick him u got schooled by Tyson u deledued guy rocks in his gloves you glue head 😂
Always abt race!! But we need to end racism??
Tyson fury all thecwayyyyy
So dumb
You're a great fighter wilder god bless you okey
This man sees Tyson every time he looks in the mirror
To dis day! Still delusional.
Fury got up. You didn't get up. You went out on your face. So only one man got knocked out. You........
Wilder vs Sergei Pavlovich would be epic.
Come on now, Nate Diaz was a lightweight for most of his career. That would be a silly fight to make.
Bombzquad 🔥
What a disgraceful racist and sore loser. Imagine if a white boxer was asked who they are supporting in a boxing fight and they replied with: "I'm going to go with my white brother." - it would be all over the news and that boxer would be subsequently  cancelled and unemployed. Double standards much?
Does this guy smoke crack now? Mid/late thirties (idk) and gonna start an MMA Career while simultaneously up-keeping his boxing career and gonna smoking Nate being 100 lb heavier or whatever, am I missing something 😂
Detontay u got beat twice and had every excuse under the sun gloves ur water being positioned and ur outfit
“You knocked tyson fury out…”. No he didn’t, ass-lick. How about sticking to the truth?
Good job Wilder. Love the interview .. y’all can’t bash him .. they didn’t call that right with Fury in his fight. I totally agree.. he lean on Wilder the entire fight.
I agree with D Wilder 👊🏾
You knocked nobody out.he knocked you out bro!!!
He’s still bitter doesn’t surprise me one bit
Was a good interview until the DUM ASS question about a Nate Diaz Fight… 👎🏾👎🏿🇳🇬🇺🇸
Wilder still not over it 😂
Wilders brain is gone in reverse!! He means Tyson knocked me out,  and he can knock Ngannou out.
You didn't knock Fury out, you knocked him down.. but he got back up and knocked you out. Then you made excuses about your costume being too heavy 😂 😆
N. Gannon 😆 🤣 😂.  Please guys if he wins pronounce his surname right it's very easy. Ngannou...don't stress the N, by that I mean don't say the vowel 'e'...it's more like Gannou. E.g sing/singannou, now say singannou but si silently in your mind then ngannou out...nganowu! Never say the 'E'. Because it's not EnNgannou it's Ngannou
He won’t beat Fury.. But let’s say he did. That would make him better then Wilder
This fellas brain is still chewing wasps on the canvas from when fury knocked him into the shadow realm
Lol Black people. Tyson fury lays his butt out
Difference being, if he loses he will not come out with a plethora of pathetic excuses.
Ladies & Gents, That’s The BIG DOSSER😂
'i knocked him out' and STILL should have lost...how delusional is this guy?
What a hater! Also u know he’s watching this fight😂 if by sone chance fury threw the fight and let Francis win d will be the first person to post his opinion🤦‍♂️
Nate is 30lbs lighter than Wilder.
Wow soo many sooks in the comment section 😂! If you wanna be factual about it fury definitely did not make the 10 count on the knock down, get a stop watch and clock it. And second of all he is allowed to root for his African brother there is nothing racist about it stop being so sensitive people.
deontay got a draw against a man that had been through hell, then got fucked up the next 2 times he is a delusional fury kicked your ass
DW no way you should go to MMA
Deontae is one of the best word smiths of our time
Wilder is a dumb, racist hater. You got demolished by Tyson. 😂
WILDER VS NGANNOU 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too much Ego. Accept defeat
Wilder "I knocked Fury down" Tyson Fury "I knocked Wilder out" 😂
these cringers in the comments have worse excuses than their idol wilder lol.
The so-called biggest puncher of all time reckons that the ufc fighter will win when he can't, and it comes down to racism blatantly, and if a white man said I have to predict my white brother as DW said there would be outcry and 📞 for racism but never mind.
This guy is embarrassing
Paid by Saudi to come. Like other celebs. Garbage
Wilder picks francis because he's black
This man will never get over what toyson fury done to him lol
He pickin race...i lov francis but i dont tink he hav what it takes to win this fight...if he ketch fury wit acouple hay makers he could hav a chance...but if that dont happen francis dont hav much of a chance
The King #BOMBZQUAD
After 3 times getting beat hes still in denial
that necklace looks like the one you would inherit from your grandma
Wilder sounds like a real good man
I wonder who hits harder? Wilder or Francis?
You know he made some money betting on slap
Wilder never knocked Fury out instead he knocked Fury down he's the one who was knocked out by Fury and till this day the man is still in denial and I doubt his pride and ego will ever recover from the defeats if not the beating that Fury have him. He should just move on really and try get a new rivalry or feud so that he can boost his ego again.
Knocked him down  Never knocked him out 😂 Pretty much knocked him out ? FR  I pretty much walked 300 miles yesterday  But I was driving my car 🤣🤣
Ngannou vs Wilder…
dude Tyson fury beat you three times in a row lol
“You pretty much knocked him out”…… What!? 😂
Ok ll go for the white guy so
Go to Africa Mr Wilder and see if they’re your “ brothers” 😂
Fights bums and journeymen, threatens journalists😂
The only dropped him in the first fight. the other fights he played with you and I think he allowed you to hit him, so think about that.
💣 squaaad
I did not no wilder is funny😂
I know very well that if a match stands now between Fury and Wilder.  Fury will forget his own name if care is not taken.
Fury cheated Wilder in those first two fights with those gloves and was given help by the referee by waking him up. Only white fans are blind to what we clearly saw with our own two eyes. It was a corporate decision to allow what happened to Wilder.
Hey Wilder put your Money on it 😂😂💸💸💸💸
*Wilder a racist clown, still petrified of Fury.*
This reporter is clueless. He ask heavyweight Donte wilder if he wants to fight a welterweight being Nate Diaz lol
*Wilder still has nightmares about Fury. He never knocked him out.*
Why the hell would anyone wanna see deontay wilder vs Nate Diaz lol do you not understand how bad a mismatch that is? 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
He’s probaly pissing through money after the embarrassment in the fury fights trying to pay people to hang around him and keep his famous life going … 😂 what a bum! FURY ALL DAY BAYBEEEE🏆🥇🏅🎖️   Also he said he not watching the fight because he’s traveling LOLOLOL what a salty pretzel!! 🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨🥨 He def watching lol 😂
This is the best thing iv seen wilder say. I hope naganu does win
Bro never tell nobody your plans for the future cause thats bad business and bad luck
Blax are the most racist people. But you cant say shit about that.
oddly fury is the only man wilder hasnt knocked out lol lol what moron he is.
I hate this clown. I was never a fan of Fury but when he fought this loudmouth pos I definitely wanted Fury to win. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Fury knock him out twice🙂
Well, you can’t do follow up punches after a knock down in boxing rules. So it’s not a knock out.
the face is not supposed to be punched for a game. that's what islam says
Fury hit Wilder so good he’s still making excuses! 🤣🤣🥊
This man is a sore loser
MMA ?? Give Wilder a fight against Alexander Volkov . They both 6ft7 killers  . Oh yeah Volkov by stoppage  in 1 round 😂
He's only picking Ngannou because he's black lol, unfortunately it's take more than race to when a fight.
Wilder still brain damaged what tyson done to him 😂😂
I feel bad for this dude fr look at his eyes he’s broken
Black people ain’t racist but they always vote black and white people should always vote white because it ain’t racist.
Uhh correction Wilder you dropped  Fury (he layed on the canvas for a few seconds) beat the count and TKOed you!! When did you knock him out?
You dropped him you never knocked him out. Hate wilder
A true man takes defeat on the chin not sit and bitch about it.
Fury is the cryptonite of fury
"My African brother" ❤
Just for that, I’m gonna go re-watch the fights of him and fury
I’m going with Ngannou because he’s black. And yeah I would love to Fight someone 3 weight classes below me bet! What a racist coward
I like Wilder but he’s getting annoying nowy he visits every fury fight and says fury will lose. He even said he thinks jake won that fight against tommy. He is the biggest fury hater just because he got knocked out two times by him and fury respected him after that
2:26 is he saying  ethno or what? What is that?
Tribal at it's most deluded as usual.
So he's basically saying he would lose to Ngannou himself
Where's that dent in his head?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm very happy and Emotional as you said you go with your Africa brother, peace be with you bruh✌🏿
Retire bum.thats not a k.o. to the interviewer and deonty😂pretty much
What a fckn clown. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Must be grand to be a Vegas bookie going into this one. Shorten Fury to 10 cents in every dollar bet. Put Francis out at $10 for every dollar bet. Watch the same mugs who bet on McGregor versus Mayweather come out to play. The bookies will be going out for steak and lobster come post fight night! Thing is, both Tyson and Francis will be joining them at the table. It's a stitch-up.
He is still renting out some room in his head to Tyson. Good fella
Don’t forget the FACT that Tyson “The Cheating Cokehead” Fury CHEATED against Deontay Wilder during their SECOND fight!
Wow the king has left wilder an innocent fool
So basically wants the black guy to beat the white guy.  Imagine that was said the other way round from a white athlete
This man is a Bitch..any man who doesn't respect his opponent especially after his opponent best him 3 times..That man is a bitch...
This interviewer is borderline gay for wilder, you're horrible bro and who is asking for a nate diaz wilder mma fight besides you???? Diaz beefs up to get to 185, the lightest wilder ever been was 210, at least do some homework bruh
The first to take it seriously excuse me you must’ve forgotten about Clarissa shields she’s been on that mission you’re late to the brigade
Stil in denial after get twated twice
We want to deontay fight again please
impressive. hay. Yō. Deonte wilder did knock Tyson fury the fuck out. but the rev cheated. by slow counting Tyson out. well. guys it is not a surprise to me at all. Afterall. Tyson has been known to be cheater.  word. hay. Yō. ungannau is going to knock Tyson fury out to the middle of next week Yō. and he has been coached right know by the legendary iron mike Tyson too. Yō. games over. lights out Tyson furry. and that. anyone can take to the bank. it is too bad that they are not contesting for the belt .   well. it's going to be very entertaining. stay tuned. home sss skillets. home sss slide. hay Yō.  Deonte wilder. stay blessed brother. peace. love. and soul Yō. one.
Wait, Who knocked who out?   Delusional mush...   I watched about 30 rounds between Fury and Wilder and have Wilder winning 2 rounds total.    We're now changing the definition of "Knock out" now a days, too?
Of course he would he wakes up every morning and has to look in the mirror and face defeat in many ways including that chip on his shoulder about being black
Fury humbled Wilder
Fury completely broke him, knocked the only two brain cells he had out of his skull.
Forever salty that he got his arse kicked by a White man. Just like the rest of his ilk.
You didn’t knock him out, ya knocked him down. Lmao stop take the loss
Confirm edo boy ❤❤❤
racist deontay
Wilder is a hater u won't be watching the fight this is a Mega fight
He's such a hater omg im jus soo tired of him nd his negativity. You lost 3x get over it son!
Wilder would destroy Fury in a real fight
If ngannou slows up in speed or action Tyson will use his weight on him and land a couple of punches but if ngannou holds up and keeps landing those bombs we know he can then it’s lights out
Clown😂
The hate is strong with this one
Delusional D
@0:08 it's pretty asssyytin once you come in person and see it and you see the blows landing to the FLACE!😳😳😳
Lol pretty sure he has no knockouts of fury
sound like something a sore racist loser would say.
champ
Talk about not letting it go 😂
You knocked him out? Are you sure?
Lets go ngannuo Jesus's...he knows inside
The ‘Slap’ contest is people inside boredom and lack. No matter who supports and speaks on the ‘bravado.’
Yeah I'm with the black fighters. Don't trust white people ever, id rather trust a hungry lion than the english or white man...
Just needs to learn take down defense and ufc might protect him from grapplers like they did Alex Pereira
Fury changed this man
Shocker he's not picking tyson 😂 dnt worry he's gona proof you wrong again
Don't get it wrong deontay Wilder knocked furio in the first boxing match 🤘🤘🤘🤘 I'm with you welder I saw you ko Fury.😊 Fury's a 🤡🤡🤡
Lool he didn't knock him out. HE got ktfo lmao. Wilder will NEVER get over it lmao
Chump
Fury picking up his easiest payday of his professional career, a punchers chance ? No chance.
Deontay will never get over the losses to Tyson
Love Deontay he's the most exciting boxer I've seen since Nigel Benn
Fury is scared at faceoff conference, little known what's he's tricks he'll does at fight. . . . Millennium boxer BB Wilder
Because furry fuck you 3 time wilder that’s why you pick naganru 😡😡
Plonker
respect to wilder and ngannou ..as well as tyson
Fury haunts this man 😂
Once again he brings it back to race, I know that loss to a British man killed him
Wilder is terrified of Tyson FURY
He didn't knock him out, that was clearly debunked, Tyson fury hit him way too hard
Why is everyone ignoring zhang
Let's go Nigannouuu
Nate diaz…😂😂😂😂
FN will be lost, ya dont get on TF pro boxing level overnight at his age nor half assssing it IF that during his MMA career.  FN will also gas out by rd 5, IF that while DW trips over his own feet by rd 4 when fighting TF. Going FN huh,  shocker lmao.  🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😆
When did Wilder knock him out?  In what world does Deontay live in?
Wow the bronze bomber confirm his from Edo state(Nigeria) 2:27. Truly African 👌
I bet wilder got a good wrestling game
say what you want about Wilder, but he went out on his shield. Rare quality in boxers nowadays.
Im sure those beatings in fights 2 and 3 left DW silly.  Ya dont just shake those off, one good shot and the brain calls time out.
Too many digs to the head Deontay you're delusional
Fury humbled him well changed his personality no more bombsquaddddddd
Fury turned this dude into a fruit loop
TO THIS DAY !!!!!
My dear African brother Deontay: you knocked Fury DOWN not OUT. That's why he got UP,  knocked you DOWN and permanently OUT your lights. Gracie.🤣🤣🤣
Man he’s too cool 😎 he gave you a great interview. I agree, the count was really long, but it’s still amazing that Fury could come back from that at all, like any time that week. 😂
Sore loser.
Bah.  Ngannou couldn't beat Wilder, he'll never beat Fury.
Wilder still tasting lemons
You are a man whose head is filled with envy and hatred. You do not like to accept defeat as a man. It's like people who have ideas like that win or lose.
Fury can beat his ass a hundred times he trained super super hard for the third fight but still it wasn't enough to beat Fury, just accept Fury is the better man period and the resentment will go away
Fury will kick ur African brothers ass just like he kicked ur ass ...3 times
Still salty about those losses 😂
When will a Black back a White?
King i love you but you didnt knock him out. He in fact knocked you out 2x. Still takes nothing away from you
Fury living rent free in the excuse makers head 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Nate Diaz vs a 6’ 7” heavy weight.  Makes all the sense in the world.  😂
What a deluded , bitter cry baby !
Tyson Fury emotionally castrated this dude. It's sad too, because I live like 90 miles away from him and he used to be an Alabama hero
Haha got his ass whooped 3x 😂
What a sore loser
cool to see wilder on a good vibe
Nganou gonna fight till 10 n of he is gonna get the belly he will its game ova but its gonna be a decision or ref ahole gonna stop it
Wilder you're 38 years old it's a bit late to to even think about going into a cage fight,and as a career,🤥 you know that's just talk to draw attention to yourself...
Bitter man, and the guy doing the interview isn’t any better pretty much KO’d Fury he got back up 😂😂😂 did you forget! first fight Fury got robbed, 2nd fight you got stopped  because you were doing the chicken dance 🐔😂, 3rd fight you got KO’d. Get your facts right.
Sort your hair out man
Racist prick if a white person said I'm going with the white guy there would be hell to pay I'm sick of the double standards and the fact of the matter is he has hit Tyson with his best shots and couldn't keep Tyson down
Bumm squad... Gypsy school you for life....😂😂😂
So Wilder had a already knocked out opponent in front of him in the 12th Round and the biggest puncher couldn’t finish him 😂 Just think about this logically, if you’re saying Fury was knocked out that means Wilder had a mentally comprised fighter in front of him with 2 minutes left on the clock and he still couldn’t finish him. That proves you didn’t handle your business. He got up and won that round too lol. The way it all played out showed the referee was right with that call.🥊
Hes got this "till this day" mindset thatz only why he picking francis he knowz francis has no chance 😂
Bitter wilder hahaha asif he gona get near him
love wilders personality hope too see him back soon he was v brave to come back after fight 2 but fight three he gave fury hell
Tyson Fury finished this man. He has fought 1 round in 2 years since the Fury trilogy. And this is someone who used to be very active. He has 43+ fights whereas others have like 30 but now his will is broken by Fury. Him and AJ are in the same boat tbh. AJ is fighting regularly so we are able to see he’s broken but Wilder is not even active
He was saying dude name all fucked up lmao
The hate seeps out of this guy still
But he really makes sense these days, Fury really humbled him
I agree.
This guy would pick anyone over Fury
Racist!
Shows his knowledge on boxing... Or bitterness
Bro will Forever be a Hater. Dude even said Jake Paul beat Tommy😂
Stop wilder….
❤❤❤😂
Fury whoop your ass 3times haha😊😊😊
King 👑 Deontay Wilder
He's just envious of fury
Lol, this dosser is coping so badly that he had to make up an alternate reality. Got destroyed 3 times and still can't accept it. What an absolute bum. Cry more.
This dude so biased never gives Fury any credit.
Respect
Wilder needs to stop talking and get fighting
BROWN TURTLES STICK TOGETHER
Knocked him out and he got up and continued beating the shit out of you 😂
His terrified to fight everyone
Baddest looser and racist guy! I was for you against Fury, but happy now that you lost.
deontay in mma would be crazy
I hope he doesn’t have too much in that bag around his neck, carrying  all that weight he’s at risk of losing all his energy and falling asleep halfway through a power slap show.
Deontay looks well .think he got a mixed up about the fury fights though?
So he thinks Francis can defeat him too? Make it make sense one hit wonder lol
This guy still feels a type of way after his three losses I would as well if I got beat like that
I love fury because he’s willing to give wilder another shot.. They will fight one last time before they retire.. No other HW would give wilder four opportunities.. Fury is the goat
The night tyson rose from the dead like chucky, wilder will never forget.
He aint pickimg no white man over a black man and still butt hurt fury beat the snot outta him
Of course he goes against Tyson. Because he’s sore loser.
Nate v wilder in MMA, lol. I love Nate but that fight wouldn’t get sanctioned as Nate would almost certainly be killed! ❤️🇦🇺
Deontay should b ashamed of himself.  Francis is meat
Lol this guy still going
When did he knock him out? He must be still punchdrunk.
Jealous ex that never got over her man😂😂😂 u will never get another fight loser
ENGGANYO😂😂😂😂
Wilder Still having a lot of nightmares about Fury.
Those skinny legs are not ready for MMA😂
All great but what African brother crap.  If you all we’re in Africa you’d all be absolutely nothing and hungry.  Start praising the place and people that made you what you are already
It was ok Him hitting people on the head but now that Tyson Fury used His head as a punching bag ,your head is not supposed 🙄 to be hit ,Geezzzz this guy
Wilder u trippin
Neganyu
Criiiiiinnnngggge 🤣
tyson would never fight mma cause he's not a real fighter
If he did MMA he will be just as scary as Ngannou, He can K.O any man alive, But in MMA he need more ground game obviously, and takedown defence, If he did that, he will be scary MF
Difference is Deontay Fury got up and ultimately you didn’t. Why can’t you be gracious in defeat?
Lying arse sucking questions.
Has not done anything likes competiting lol
wilder is a BEATEN TWAT.      so  stupid.
Tyson did not get knocked out he got up so its not a knock out .......fury will beat him to easy
Wilder did knock him out in 1st fight!
So bitter 😭
Dude won’t watch the fight 💯, he can’t even see fury photos. 🫣
Anyone who picks Ngannou is a fool....Fury will toy with him for as long as he wants.
What a surprise he thinks Francis will win. Lol
Not surprised u make your pick based on color
Nice interview. Wilder seemed pretty chill here. I wish he could have trained some w/ Francis.
He should fight ciryl gane
This much be the coke head page for Fury fans.  🖕🏾
Engano!!!!! That's Spanish for deceit
yep! he still got that brain damage from the Fury fight
Powerslap is definitely different lol 😂
This guy made boxing excited
still hurt by his loss against fury. your brother will knockout same as you lol.
They should have gloves so the ko doesn't happen on the first slap
Any other ref, Fury would have been counted out in the first fight. Crazy how a decision made in a moment so small in time can affect the trajectory of an athlete’s career.
No deonkey you knocked him down he knocked you out 🤣🤣
Francis Ngannou will put Tyson Fury to sleep for sure, Deontay Wilder is 50 pound lighter than Francis, he knocked Fury down four times,  when Franics knock Fury down it is fcuking good night!!!!! Tyson Fury is dirty dirty fighter, now the table turned as Francis have answers for every his dirty tricks. Tyisn Fury is a dead man waling now!!!!!!!!
Wilder's speech has slowed down a lot since the fury3 fight  definitely took some long term damage there 💯
Why’s is always have to be a black issue…News flash the white boy will whip his ass just like he did yours😂
He a hater he knows as long as fury got that belt he will never get that belt back
Wilder vs jon bones for ufc title jones would choke him out in 3 seconds
Happiest I've seen this man. It's great that he's becoming the man that he's meant to be now. Living in anger really just means the man has fear.  Right now he has no fear
I love the support from a brother to a brother Deontay represented us black folks n loss in black history month but he was cheated for a fact but still the man of the people
All the wilder hate is crazy, calling a rich man a bum is crazy too, yall weird asf
Whys he wearing grandma's necklace.
Wilder definitely knocked Fury out, the ref could've counted to 12 that night 😂💪🏾
That thinking got Obama  the gay wad elected
lol "im going with Nghanu cause he is my African brother" lol imagine a white dude saying same about Fury. "im going with Fury cause he's my white European brother
wilder knock him down but tyson knock tyson out 2 times
Fury still living rent free in wilder head
Him being so open to do MMA fights is exciting! Deonte has the frame and athleticism to transition really well as long as he picks up and falls in love with wrestling and jiu jitsu. It's not everyones jam just like swimming isn't everyones jam. Some guys might be athletic and capable, but you toss them in a pool and they become toddlers learning to walk again and a lot of grown ups, especially in Deonte's position, don't want to learn to walk again when they feel they've climbed and conquered mountains. He'll have to humble himself if he's serious about doing it, which is hard to see, but if he does it will be fun and we can start evening up the score with how many MMA guys went to boxing vs. how many boxing guys have came over to MMA.
This guy is so butt hurt he turned into a hemorrhoid
He’s deffo streaming the fight while travelling stop it deon 😂😂
Doesnt even know his african brothas name
Tyson took wilder nuts real talk
Delusional
Ngannou-Wilder is the real fight to make that’s a fucking earthquake
He's still salty😂
Deontay chicken legs
Your brother from another mother from the motherland shall get ko just like you let's get it GYPSY KING 🤴. 🤓🥊
Wilder is still going strong and probably most definitely has Envey problems against Tyson fury The gypsy king. 🥊🇮🇪🥊😆😁😂😁😆😁
i lold so hard
Tyson fury alpha male will always beat the beta males. I would love to see Wilder get his ass whooped mma..
You didnt knock him out wilder yoi bum
Hate all u want wilders one of the coolest hws out here
Just imagine Fury saying in an interview when making a prediction “I clearly stand by my white brother from Europe”😂  I love this shit
Still has brain damage from fury
Wilder give weird answers, so that the people Keep talking about him. IT IS all showbusiness
Why does Wilder always loses his breath like that?  And I’m a Wilder fan just Curious 🧐
Your African brother is getting busted. No pressure for the fat WHITE man. No problem what so ever.
Deontay still mad he lost to a fat WHITE man. Couldn’t even knock him out.
Great interview as always
Wilder still has nightmares about Fury 😂
Deluded
NaganioOOOO!!!!
butthurt asf, fury got u on a leash boaa
MMA 😂😂 imagine someone like JJ getting hold of those legs 😂😂😂 please
