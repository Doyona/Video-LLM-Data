Plz tell me what sneakers you are wearing I love them
hi everyone. i remember 4-1 year(s) ago, when i was at a weight that was more acceptable than it is now. i am now about 75kg, and i've gained so much since law school, and i dont know why, but it seems like i cant control it. i exercise, am now on break so im trying to get it in more, and i eat that is consistent mostly so i dont get called out by my parents for not eating to not get gastritis lol. i dont feel strong anymore, and my clothes dont fit, and i dont know what i can do other than working out more to get myself back, and to feel confident again.
Thank you! Mood booster for the rest of the day😄
Love thank you. I love
I hurt my back in sport and it's something I can do and don't hurt it more.🎉
❤❤ Thanks Pamela
You make working out,fun and sexy and short lol love it!💕
I just discovered your channel thanks to a video of « Lenadorable » channel and I love your vibe❤❤❤ I see that you have lot of videos of glutes activation but could you do a video of breast enhancement ( musculation without equipment) ?? I don’t know if it’s possible to have results without push up it kinda difficult for me😢😢😢😅😅😅I’m desperately looking for exercises that fonction. If you can do it it be would really be the must.
Love it love it love it. What a boost last 2 songs 👌👌👌👌👌👌
when i started your workouts a few years agp, i didn't have much to shake... but i realized today as i was doing this one that has changed hahaah much love pammm <3

A really fun one! Made me really excited and happy 😃
First time, wanted something that made me feel confident! I didn’t finish it the first go only got too the 3rd song but will make my way to completing! Im hoping by the end I look nice doing the moves too! Will keep going daily on my weight loss journey!
thank you so much pamela - it is a bad weather so i didnt want to go for a walk, and i was feeling tired to do a proper workout, and i know i should do some movement every day to lose weight. this gave me a better mood and i feel good about accomplishing something :)
I remmber doing it with my mother during covid and lost weight doing all of Pamela's videos. And now, 2023 is about to end, I'm getting married in the beginning of 2024, and here i am doing only Pamela's workouts to get back into shape. Her covid videos always make me nostalgic. Thank you Pamela!
I love every dance workout, thank you so much Pamela, you make my day happier! :D

My brain: O.O R&B you like R&B My two left feet: please don't
Yay! This was a fun one!! I love starting my workouts with a dance workout/warm up:) This is only the 2nd Pamela Reif video I've followed but I can't wait to explore more of her content
I love Pamela’s dance workouts ❤️ You enjoy yourself while literally sweating to death…. Pam if you’re reading this, I began my fitness journey a long ago but because of your fun dance workouts, I’ve managed to stay consistent.
❤
I'm in love with this . Really, it brings me so much joy <3
Hi💋
Hello @Pamela Reif me and my family workout together with your videos and we were wondering what is the shoe model that you are wearing in this video?     Can you send the link for it as well please 🙏,  your fans in LA!!!
We need more dance workouts girl :>
This was a really fun workout💃
I AM SOOOOO GLAD SHE HAS 10 & 15 MINUTE WORKOUTS-  not 30 and 60 minutes that kill you off. It's what keeps me coming back!
that was so much fun
MY FAV DANCE WORKOUT EVERRR
Did this before I hit the treadmill, the high knees were so much fun!
This was super fun
OOO GIRL LOL I NEEDED THAT THANK YOU FOR A GREAT WORKOUT
Wenn man sich jetzt so bewegen könnte 🥲
Wow I loved it! Could you do another workout like this but with Christmas music when the time comes (like in November or December)?
Watched this lying on bed ñ had a really great time
like seriously, ive been working out through different sources for the past 6-7 months, and i always thought i loved working out but i knew in my heart that i forced it, and i tried the dance workout today and my body seriously felt so good throughout, i think im going to love working out
wow I feel like someone beat me up with a ladder
MY LEGS ARE SHAKING.
Level up hits differently from now on.
Surprisingly not so hard. Finally :D
can we just look at how pretty she is
that was so fun and you're gorgeous!
me: this should be easy :) also me: *breaks my back
Ciara ist the best part; had so much fun!! Thx! 🎉
How much calorie does it burn? can someone tell me
First song: "love my biscuit boy" :D
that Level Up part was burning asf bruh
I really hope the second song wasn't supposed to be the 'gangster' part cuz the song is so sad and realistic...about literal black life
So tiring but so worth it
I need more workouts with this kind of music ☺️😩
Nice dance
❤️
PLEASE PAM TO ANOTHER WORKOUT LIKE THIS!! 🥺🥺
I love you I like this video I need more video 😙😘🥰💋💟 .
More rnb workouts pleaseeeeeeee
I love this dance workout, my neighbours don't...
Who else hears and sings 'Pamela, Pamela, Pamela...'  instead of 'Level up, level up...'
everyone gangsta till pamela plays level up
Good music choice 😍😍
Just info for me: 75kcal:)
By the end I was like: "What? Was that 10 minutes? Noooo don't be finished, this is fun!"
hands down my favorite workout video from pamela

Really love some of the dance steps! can someone please shed some light on which type of dance style this is please? esp some moves from 1st song. (or maybe suggest which sub dance genre i can try for a novice) tia!
It’s the hard R for me.
Did the HIIT intensity burn a lot of a calories workout before and now I did that. Am I a hero now?
feeling really out of it and tired today because uni started today, but I felt so much better and less stressed out after doing pam's workouts, always thankful for her <3
How many calories do you burn? X
"Happy because of food" " Food is ready, dance" 😭😭 I found my soulmate hahaha
Hi! How many calories did you burn roughly? Would be nice to know :)
Love it 👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Food is ready dance" 👍❤️always
Omg! This is a real cardio....i like it but it kills me
Niiice , das mache ich gleich Mal nach , freue mich schon sooo sehr !!
Hey, please marry me
I honestly cannot believe I would actually say and believe myself when I say I enjoy working out each day because of Pamela!  If you told me to do high knees for HIIT I would tell you to get lost. Level up? GET THOSE KNEES UP, UP, UP!
Starting a new day with good vibes as usual ! 🎉🎶🎶🎶
Nice T
I really loved this! Thank u! xo
Such a good find. As an oldie trying to lose a bit of weight this is so cool and fun to do
16 Jahre hartes schwimmtraining hat mir nicht solche Oberschenkelmuskulatur gebracht wie dieses workout
this one is my faaav dance workout !!! I  don't understand 10 min how was end!
“gangster squat” lol 😂
Wer macht auch immer diese „Endstellung“? 😂
I'm in love with this workout, so fun!!!
I did pam's HIIT workout , abs and yoga workout, Jason Derulo workout chloe's HIIT workout. Still motivated thought of doing this optional workout for Saturday...   Little did I know I would end up getting cramps in my stomach 🙂
Super love this dance workout!! One of my fave among pam's dance workout now. 💯✨💓
who is here after the booty workout?? 🥵
so hyper when I saw the word FOOD. Need to include this technique in other videos Pam!
THIS IS THE FAV ONE!! Pam, please do the R&B Dance Workout part2 or maybe something LATINO's? :)
I didn’t realise how little rhythm I had till I started doing these dance workouts
I loved the Level up part so much, it just gave me the energy for the rest of the year I needed 🤩
Omgggggg the level up omgggg i loved it
I am.your biggest fan wanna meet you
I love the Level up part
HARİKASINNNNN
That was so fun!
I feel Amazing now Pamela! Thank you .... so enjoying your workouts 🎀
Did anyone sweat? Or did I just become a fitness guru 👟👟
How many calories we burn with this workout? ❤️
This was probably one of my favorites :)
Omg i loved the last part
Favourite wind down sequence for every day’s workout!!!
I loved this dance workout. I had so much fun! 😁💜
i loved this dance workout so much
i love the level up <3333
Pamela, I really have to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you do and the effort you put wholeheartedly in every single video.  I am a person who never dances, has many insecurities, and always try to put myself down. I'm following your workout plans for almost a year now and even though I've seen so much change in my body, I'm even happier that I can see it in my mindset and overall mental health also. Every day I feel stronger and more confident with who I am and who I'm becoming. I also have come to a point where I love my body exactly the way it is, and through your HIIT and Dance videos, I feel the urge to embrace my bloated belly, muscular but kinda flabby arms and fatty inner Thighs. I love all of me and I genuinely don't know how this happened. I'm pretty sure endorphin has something to do with it lol. I always skipped this R&B combo bc I was embarrassed of seeing myself in the mirror and today I decided that I don't need to hide from myself. I did this for 30 mins straight, with a ridiculously huge smile on my face. I'm so grateful. Thank You! Guys, we are all together in this. We can do it!!!
All is fun and games until gurl starts squatting.  That aside, great little dance and warm up!
So i haven't done this workout yet because the two first songs are so boring (my opionion sorry)... but today i have done it and I love the last song sooo much. May you please create a dance workout only with such power songs like the last one? pleeeaaasseee <3 <3 <3 <3
Ce finisher 🥵🥰
I know exactly how I’m gonna shake my body once parties are allowed and Low by Flo rida is on
I just wanna say I love your workouts, you are so full of energy and you are the first you tuber I workout with and feel happy ^^
Can you list your shoes along with the music? I’m always like, which Pumas are those 😍
I loooooove this one💙💙💙💙💙✨✨✨
Love your dance Workouts! Can you do a Reggaeton or Zumba Dance for some latino vibes pleeaseee 🔥
made my day !
BEST dance vid ever!!! Love the happy energy 💗💞😍
I always forget how munch cardio this has
pls do a dance workout with Beyoncé’s songs!! It would be fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was soooo much fun u need to include this more often in the workout schedules!
This was so much fun! Thank you
amazing ! that gave me a boost for the day ! Thanks a lot ! Gigi from Paris
oh god!! this is killing and hard but that happy and inspiring face of yours makes me do it EASILY!!
Everyone: doing the workout Me: trying to figure out if that door is real or wallpaper
It's all fun and games until you try this after 10min booty activation and 20min booty with weights and band lmao
I feel like someone videoed Pamela dancing without her knowing and I can't do this workout without feeling like I'm intruding :)
Doing high knees on beat with Level up is so satisfying! My favorite part of the workout.
Ok but this is so hard that I can’t do this not because of bad condition but I just can’t dance and I don’t know wth is happening 😭😭😭
Hi Pam! It would be great if you created a new 20 minute booty workout without weights, as we´ve been doing it for so long and there´s no other alternative for those who doesn´t have weights at home. I dont know if anyone agrees with me, let me know :)  Thanks Pam for everything you do for us!!!!
I did your warm up video, and ab video first & then I said a dance video ?! Let me try it! I’m SOOOOOO happy I did. This was so much fun ! I LOVED THIS . Thank you so much 🙏🏽💗
Low by Flo Rida always gets me hyped😁 this workout is definitely going on my Pam App plan👌
Probably my favorite dance workout to date 😍
me: this one is too good (easy) to be true Pam: high knees me: nvm
I LOVE this workout💥
When you do this workout before dinner and you see "Food is ready" the timing *chef kiss* 👌🤣🤷‍♀️
I've never seen such a woman's figure.  64.dq.to          @@@@@
today was rest day for me but I thought why not just do a little Pamela dance? and I feel so much better that I did!!
I hate doing cardio but I love Pam's dances I just enjoy it and have a lot of fun!
I LOVED THIS DANCE WORKOUT !!!!! AND I LOVE YOU !!! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO <3
I TOTALLY LOVED THIS! FELT LIKE A TOTAL BADASS. Thanks Pam💜💜
Pamela: Just learn the dance Me: Yes ma'am
I LOVE IT
Damn your such a vibe!- Glad I found these workouts they're so fun :))
Everything was fine until Level up Those high knee killed me
Çop
Liebe Pamela ich heise Laura und bin 8. Jahre alt. Meine Mutter und ich machen öfter deine Videos. Mittlerweile turnen Mamas Arbeitskollegen und meine Tante Christine und meine Cousins mit. Wir alle finden deine Videos toll Lg Laura aus Traunstein.
OKAAAAAAY PAMELA I SEE YOU
Me just can’t breathe bcs I have to sing the level up
I did the other two happy cardios, which would be sufficient since i only do the 30 min workout plans but i felt dizzy doing them, took a few breaks so I decided its a good time to destroy myself more and do these extra 10mins (which happen to be my fav workout lol)
Gosh I can somewhat do the dance workouts now!! 😭😭 before I was too self-conscious and insecure that I was so disoriented and couldn't do some moves. It's so satisfying to notice improvements in myself. Thank you, Pam! 😭💗💕
I love that "Level Up"-Part so much. The first time it killed me, but now it makes me really happy.
Best best best workout 👍
the best dance workout!!!
It's quiet impressive how these are all done in one shot all the time!!
Pam this is so far my favourite dance work out! The music is so so good I even downloaded Ciara's song to listen to on daily basis❤
why did I get so energized from level up? loved it tho, will definitely do again
LOVEDDD THISSSS!!! following week four of 2021 sweaty and this dance made my whole week 500 times better!!
Eigentlich bin ich nicht der größte Fan von den Dance Workouts, aber dieses hier ist so toll! Hatte lange nicht so viel Spaß dabei😂😍 LEVEL UP!
Pamela ich bin so so dankbar, dass es Dich gibt! Ich wünsch Dir alles gute auf der Welt! <3
Let's level up Pam ;) lots of love, Jenny <3
Level-up at the end is an instant motiv<tion and mood booster
High-knees have never been so much fun
Hi 🙋‍♀️  I’m here for you 🚿  Welcome 🙏 💋
Please do a “high school musical dance workout”
hey guys please make sure you have eaten and drank water before this workout so that you don’t pass out <3
Vim pela a prima Maisa
The best workout!!Fun and sweaty!!
Loved this! Soooo fun!! Thk you!
The only time high knees are okay, is with level up in the background 😄
i recently do almost all Pamela's dance workout.
This was a fun vibey workout 😅👀 defo the last song got me bopping🤪
the Ciara part is just the best 💕
I usually don't like working out but this workout made SO MUCH FUN and I could actually finish it even though I'm severly overweight. I'll def do a lot more of her dance workouts 💃💪🏻
How can anyone dislike this? It is legit one of the most fun and hip workouts<3
AMAZING!!!!
this was hella fun and at the end a little out of breath
Me dancing to 'low': 🥳😜🤠🔥 My FBI agent: 👁👄👁
Girl, this one is amazing!! Please do more like this! :)
Pamela, do you know that timer up there? Can you make a video on how to do because I want to make many videos with such a timer!
this is best🥰
I always wait till Pam remembers the correct gangster hands so we could start at the same time and she doesn't feel bad about it
I love doing this dance workout with my other workouts, I started doing it last night, and this is my second time doing it!!
I can't explain HOW HYPER i was during this😅😅😅
I love this workout ❤️ The only thing that confuses me every time is the missing beep 🙈
I just love this workout!  Never thought it would be this fun! I genuinely look forward to working out every day....
omg I love this girl so much this dance was so FUN to do but I'm literally dying
please do a 15 minutes rutine with latino music
Pam love this workout motivates me so much ly and thanks for making such an amazing dance xxxx
The end was unexpectedly satisfying 🏃🏻‍♀️ level up guys
geez...i broke a lotta sweat and one speciality u have got is the high knees..well done!! (I'm 12 years and I'm using dad's lap) :)
I love the names of the exercises!! Like „shake -yes,again“ or „food is ready dance“ 😂
Omg so many high knee QAQ
This is a great leg workout but do you have to use the word gangster? Kinda problematic
The playlist 🙋🏾‍♀️
Day1: 19/1/2021 Day2: 24/1/2021 Day3: 16/6/2021 Day4: 14/7/2021 Day5: 11/2/2025 Day6: 10/3/2025 Day7: 2/5/2025
Im obsessed.
2021
das hat so spaß gemacht omg, auch wenn ich bei level up schon am strugglen war ob es überhaupt noch endet😂 trotzdem hat es mir echt gut gefallen, würde mich mega über mehr davon freuen! <3
Nobody makes my heart beat as fast as Pamela does 😂♥️
I already see everyone, after corona, in the clubs doing squats
I wish food was actually ready
being latina means shaking your booty HASTA ABAJO
DANKE💗 das war seit langem mal wieder etwas, wo ich die ganze Zeit über und auch danach noch ein Lächeln im Gesicht hatte 🤩 hat mega Bock gemacht 🙏🏼
you were trying to kill me three times today! but I love it! thank u Pam :3
WE NEED A PART 2!
This was the most perfect blend..... THANK YOU SO MUCH PAM 😘😘😘😍😍
I love you , Pamela💕 And I absolutely love this dance workout bc it doesn't feel like you're working out it feels like a lot of fun
Need much more dance workout !!!!
I love this
I loved this workout!!!!
BEST DANCE WORKOUT! SO FUN!!!
Uffff! So great !!
ich vergesse immer wieder aufs neue, dass hier kein pieper ist hahah
today i tried to workout on the two last songs without watching pamela ( i danced just by the song) AND I DID IT!!! thanks pam for making my mood better sooo many times
oooooolala
LATIN MUSIC PLZ :)
7:53 I thought its over
Ah to be a person without any rhythm and no booty
You know you're crazy when u put a resistance band to your dance cardio :D
Anyone know how many caps burned don’t have a watch to monitor xx
Day=1 done
Intensität auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10 mal wieder bei 2 oder höchstens 3...  die Dance Workouts haben doch zu 90% alle nichts mit einem „Workout“ gemeinsam.  Wünsche mir viel mehr Intensität und mehr Power.
That was so much fun!!! Definitely sweaty though😅
Nach 6min schon fertig 😰
its awesomeeeeeeeeeee
the best workout for me 😘💓 new subscriber 🥰
level up ending is such a great mood boost! :D
I'm getting sweat for sure
“Level up, level up, level up, level up” 🎶
I LOOOOVE IT!<33
I would really like if you do a cardio or dance workout with music from early 2010. I love your workouts. xx
Super Video haben ich und meine Freundin uns an mein Geburtstag  kaputt  gelacht 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🥰🥰
Working out with my kids in the background and had to pause bc of the fact that you did use a clean version of the Lil Kim song (which is hip hop not R&B). I don’t get how you can be out here dancing and working out to a song that continuously drops the n word as a white woman. How is this monetized on YouTube?
My level is up now Pamela
Still my favourite <3
I love the part of LEVEL UP so much 😍💯 I can't stop  💃
Please do more dance workout
This is my favorite workout! It’s super fun and I’m always so hyped up! Love you Pam❤️
When “Level up” started I really knew that I was going to die
IT WAS SOOO FUN!!!
Day=3 done
please do an early 2000s one and a taylor swift one (classic songs like mean,better than revenge, shake it off,paper rings so many to choose...) !!!!! Love you
The pause at 8.00 is lethal
man after low i was like "I got this" Then level up came HAHAH
I am sorry down stairs neighbors for the level up workout
I'd love to see part two of this! Gives me a lot of energy and positive vibes
Level up kill me
This is absolutely my favorite one. Great job as always!
I like this video so much
"We in the club like" me in the club: doing gangster squats😅
http://miniurl.es/quickdates4bighot99  I LOVE YOU..! BRAZZERSS              Из-за отсутствия лучшего слова, захватывает дух. Наборы яркие. Их богатый цвет и подвижный статус притягивают наблюдателя к действию. Костюмы являются декоративными, красивыми и работоспособными одновременно. Макияж выделяет костюмы, и никто никогда не замечает тот факт, что это люди, разыгрывающие части животных. Вы настолько увлечены образами всего этогоbw 69gg
Love it!
I’m gonna be a dancer also 😂😂 Never had more fun while exercising 🥰
Does she have a grade A green screen or is that her house?
i stg pamela makes everything fun
КЛААААААСССС!!!!!
i love this
BY FAR MY FAVORITE
Love this Pam! lots of love, Jenny
This was sooo fun! Thank you Pamela for making our day with these dance exercises!
Soo good. Where is the part 2 ? ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I especially want to buy this kind of shoes.
there's me thinking okay this is good, I'm doing well, I've got it under control and then level up starts... I'm so out of breath that I can barely type this lol
at 8.00 when the music stops and no text pops up I always think the video is done and I get so proud then the music starts again PLUS high knees! like NOOOOOO. but still, gotta get it done
Hello year 2021
When this dance feels a bit like heaven after performing high intense workouts....😗😗 And...the last series with the titles referring to step-wise movement of food near me made me dance very heavily ( but later came to know I had no food in reality near me😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣)
Dance Workout für mich??? Hat aber total Spaß gemacht !!!
Me with every exercise: Nope, I don't get it.
she makes me so happy to workout
So fun!
This is my favorite from all of the dance workout videos - because Level Up in the end gives the best feeling ever! I love jumping to this song!
Von wo sind die Schuhe?😍
Ahh loved it ❤️
🖤
Oh I love it so much! Thank you Pam for these workouts. They are the best! You are the best ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE 😍😍😍😍
Done
This is for all of the men, women, girls, and boys who are out there eating under their recommended caloric intake!   Coming from someone who has done this themself, I would like to say that eating too little can trigger your bodies “survival mode”. When “survival mode” is triggered, your body will slow down it’s metabolism and store fat cells in an attempt to preserve energy to prepare for a long period of time without food. Think of it like when a bear goes into hibernation and needs to live off of the food it stored before going to sleep. The bear’s body will naturally preserve the food (fat cells) so that the bear can survive while it is still asleep and can not eat. Instead of eating dangerously a low amount of calories, you should little by little lower your caloric intake until you are in a 500 calorie deficit (if my body needs 2,300 to maintain weight a 500 calorie deficit is 1,800 calories) AT MOST. Lowering your calories little by little can create a less shock for your body! And one more thing! No matter how small you are, NEVER eat below 1,200 calories either! Everybody needs at least 1,200 calories to function. I hope this helps!   - Written by someone who did this to themself 🙂
just did two of the videos... sitting here vibing like.. should I do one more?
It's the first time ever I've enjoyed high knees this much
My absolute favorite dance workout! :)
Dieses workout hat mich grade so gekillt haha
love this one
It is so good I like this I am happy
This is my favorite Pamela's dance workout by far!!!
I love this so mutch 🥰
I love the form she combined her clock color with outfit😭
I had no energy to workout today but after this 10-minute-dance I feel renewed energies. Thank you Pam you are very good at what you do. 🙌
Pammmm, could you please make a "Latin Dance Workout"? I'm from Argentina and I would REALLY LOVE IT. All your latin fans are waiting for it 😍
Can anybody tell me what’s the name of the shoes she wears in this video?😻😻🥺
OMG that was so fun!!!
Feel so good this dance workout!! thank pamela!
I usually hate high knees but to the beat of level up they are like the most fun thing ever 😂
oh nawl lmfaoooo
the level up part was the most fun but excruciating part i looove it
🔥🔥
that was fun !!! love your videos
this workout made me exited for the next day to do it  :) <3
Wenn ihr sehen wollt, wie es aussieht, wenn ein blutiger Anfänger sich durchquält, dann schaut doch gerne mal rein ;)  https://youtu.be/JnQdqBzEzNg
I really have to leave a big, fat THANK YOU here - unlike people who totally got INTO fitness during lockdown, I lost all motivation. It took a lot of effort just to continue practicing yoga to avoid turning into a total slug! Two weeks ago, two of my students gave a mini presentation in class, and they both mentioned you, so I had to check things out (of course). What can I say? I've been loving your dance workouts (even though I'm really a klutz with two left feet), and I've been looking forward to getting to the mat every day! In other words: you've helped me get my mojo back. I know 2021 will be a fitter, better year. Thanks, Pamela!
awesome that was fun 💕💕💕

This dancing workout is amazing 😍 😍😍 thank you Pamela
YES!!! WAS WAITING FOR THIS!
Loved the LEVEL UPPP 📈 ❤️❤️❤️
Your Amazon Music playlist is “unavailable” why is that?
This is sooo amazing!! Level increases perfectly and the music puts me in such a great mood!!
my favourite dance workout video!thanks pamela!
Ist hier noch jemand, der bei Level Up immer direkt Seitenstechen bekommt?😄
Lots of fun! Doubt if people saw me doing it they'd think it was Sexy! But still a cool workout
Hallo,  ich habe leider bei den High Knees on the Beat immer wieder Schmerzen im unteren Bauch. Kann mir jemand sagen warum oder was das ist? Hat das vielleicht jemand auch? Komischer Weise habe ich bei Jumping Jacks keine Schmerzen. Danke für die Hilfe schon einmal im Vorraus!
LEVEL UP is so fun!!!
Pamela I loved this!! Please do a christmas dance!!!!
Girl u fire! Love ur workouts. ,🤗
Very hot dance 🔥🔥😈
Wenn die Clubs wieder öffnen, tanzen alle die dieses Workout gemacht haben deine Choreo im Club 😂😍

By far my favorite work out video from you!! Love it
A Christmas dance workout💕
Superrr
That last one....damn! ❤️💋😘😍👋🏼👍🏼
Love this one😍😍😍 best so far 😍😍😍
Mein liebstes Dance Workout 😍 macht so Spaß, dass die Zeit verfliegt😊😊
I LOVE ❤️ the dance 💃
Love it! Totally enjoyed it. Thank you Pam.
The best training everrr
First time happened with Pam's workout that I did all of them without stoping and enjoyed it otherwise in all others I just stop and rest for a while Yes you give us a lot of pain but we will be always supporting you ❤️
The best video 😍😍😍
This is so much fun! ❤️ The music is fun, the moves are funnier and the way I look when doing them must just be hilarious. Makes you feel goofy...in a geeky and good way.
a little gangster????
Honestly, I was shy to do this..but then it's too good to just watch others do it and not try it yourself.. This woman is amazing, she made me dance! Oh God!
AHHHHH!!!! Thank you so much Pam!!! i was having a pretty bad day :( thank you for making me smile :))
This was so much fun!
That was sooooooo fun!
I hope this is up a notch. Choreography and musicality is very amateur....I understand this is a workout. But it could be something more expressive and entertaining and I’d be hooked.
Can you please make another intense ab workout? Your videos are amazing.
Best dance-workout ever ❤️ the level up move is my favourite😍
Kannst du bitte dance workouts mit Weihnachtsliedern machen?? 😍
Love the dance workouts! They get me motivated and energized and are super fun! Looking forward to a LOT more
u did a great job
I heard so hard critics on this one which said it was pretty hard, but I only thought it was fun
I think it would be cool if there was a christmas dance workout🥰🤔🎄
The sheer joy emanating from this video is infectious -- when I wasn't dying I was smiling along. Thanks for another terrific vid, I've been sharing your channel with friends and coworkers any chance I get.
Maybe salsa workout? ☺️😁👍
Week 37, day 2, did the workout without any breaks 🤯💪🏻
Wenn alle in der Disco bei low sexy Tanzen und ich pamela reifs workout mache
Omg THE BEST WORKOUT EVA
This was so much fun 💖 pls do another!
lobe it!!!
Das ist leider das erste Dance-Workout was mir überhaupt nicht gefällt von Pamela 😭 es war nicht anspruchsvoll (außer ganz am Ende) und es war auch keine mitreißende RnB-Musik. Hatte mich sooo drauf gefreut 😟 schade!
Beste Dance Workout bisher. Hast mich zum lächeln gebracht obwohl ich dich noch 10 Minuten vorher verflucht habe 😂
Best dance workout so far!!! I had so much fun doing this
Me and my sister love your sassy and fun style on social media. Funky mixes and cool moves. Keep doing your thing. Carlos & Bex
we need a dancehall dance workout with a to of twerk moves!!!
Am I good at dancing: No Do I like dancing : No Do I like Dance Workout: YES  I hate dancing and working out, it always makes me feel like I am not good enough, I am just not confident while doing. But strangely I love dance workouts, they're the only I do, they make me feel confident and happy, something normal workouts just can't do. I currently trying your new beginner schedule, but it is just not fun for me, I have to force myself and doesn't work on the long run, I will probably stick with dance workouts
This workout will definitely change your mood :D Thanks Pam!
pamela let me tell you we NEED a dance workout with christmas songs!! 😍
I loooove this workout so much, thank you ! Definitely my fav video :D
i could do this 24/7! it‘s insane how this bring out my energetic side even after the hardcore hiit!
I love that this is a dance workout, because it's a bit different! That said, this is mad white gal dancing.
After the Song low. Me: omg that was fun, now a Break  Pamela: no no, level up!
I just did this today for the first time. Hahaha, level up was ON POINT. So much fun!!!
More likes these love them
yesss! More R&B workout pls! This is soooo fun🤣🤣
I never enjoyed high knees so much

i don’t think enough people realise how big of a star pamela reif is. her taste for the best quality music, workouts, editing, lifestyle, influence-skills are SO PROFESSIONAL compared to other influencers. she is definitely in the top, even if not many people see it immediately.❗️

fave dance workout of you
I love these dance videos SO MUCH ! I didn't wanted to workout today so I did dance workouts in my bedroom and ended up feeling myself ! Here is some theme suggestions for future dance videos :  - latina/reggaeton - rock hits  - pop music (from the 2010s like Katy Perry, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Kesha) - dj songs (David Guetta, Calvin Harris)
Pamela i think your one of my new favorites! You look so cute doing this video. I really dont have any groove when I dance, I will try this to get a good workout in and dance freely
Tried this dance workout today and it was a fun routine! I’ve also tried your 4 15 minute dance workouts. Like these dance videos thanks Pamela
Dein bestes Dance Worrkout! Hat mich (normalerweise 4-5 mal 1,5 im Fitnessstudio)  sogar im Vergleich zu den anderen Dance Workouts ein bisschen aus der Puste gebracht.
Kann jemand mit einer Fitness watch Mal schreiben wie viel das Workout so verbraucht? Ich finde das immer so als Anhaltspunkt ganz interessant 😳
Pls make more dance videos like this 😍 i love them!!!! But could you maybe also use a more peppy music?
I really love your dance workouts. Can you please make a Christmas song dance workout?😍
This one is so fun! Thank you Pamela!
Does any one know how many calories the workout burns? 🥺❤❤
Pls do a Christmas workout 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 this would be sooo much fuuuun😭 just to get in those vibezz

Pam thank you so much, I was having a weird evening and I never dance but I suddenly knew that the only way to make me feel better was to dance it out. And of course your video came at the perfect time! I did the whole thing through with a smile on my face — you have no idea just how much joy I got from this number! I love you and your workouts so much - you motivate and inspire so many people and have gotten me into the best shape of my life. A true muse and role model. Love from California.

did this after a one hour workout and it felt AMAZING afterwards, even if I must've looked anything but sexy during the hip shakes and all ! :) you should give it a try, 'cause what does it cost !!!
7:05 the squats matching with the low low low low are sooo satisfying
PERFECT !
I love this so bad!
I did this workout with my mum and when we did the „Level up“ dance she always said „Pamela Pamela - Pamela Pamela Pamela“ to the beat 😂😂
It’s year 2023 “Level Up” starts playing in the club. Suddenly the whole club is doing high knees. Life’s good.
Little did i knew that the only club vibes  im getting this year are from doing  Pamelas workouts
Really glad I was the one watching Pam, and not the other way around :')
more dance workouts! love them!
Omg! I loved this dance workout! Some of my favorite songs were in there! I loved the routine! It was so much fun to do! I was feeling myself! So energetic and it boosts up your mood! We need more R&B workouts! Who's with me?

This workout was really good! Definitely boosted my mood 🥰
Before watching this video: this is going to be easy After the video: *out of breath and panting like a fish out of water*
I like that 🧿
This is the kind of stuff that helps you lose weight but working out helps build muscle
Not me twerking on the "shake don't be shy" part
Love this Pam Reif!!  My daughter and I do lots of your workouts and this one was so much fun!!!  Thank you for doing this.
Did all the workouts for today and THEN add this on because I loved it so much yesterday!

I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!  We need a CHRISTMAS DANCE WORKOUT!
S C H Ä M DICH  Du Perversierst die Kinder So sehr dass sie ihren Scham verlieren, Als seien sie nicht genug sexualisiert  Von dem euren gift. Denn die meisten die euch anschauen  Sind kleine Kinder. Warum Macht ijr keine Videos In dem, die Kinder etwas für  Die Schule Lernen Anstatt mit dieser Absichtlicher Perversion, in der CAMOUFLAGE, Sind Doch nur Übungen (Ich will mich doch nicht ZEIGEN, Neeiiin, Wie ich mich Rekel  und ahh wie hübsch ich mit meinem  Körper und dem Küntlichem Face bin,  Eine Nach Fame, Ruhm Suhende  Künstl(ich) erin   NEEIIINN   ) Ihre kostbare Kindliche Zeit zu Vergiften. Die euch dann nachahmen  und immern Mehr  Pädophile sich mit Lüsterndem Blick 8 jährige, beim Übungen machen Anschauen  die sie EUCH NACHAHMEN. SCHÄME DICH, SCHÄMT EUCH.  Ich meine dass nicht Böse Doch ich bin wütend da ich Kinder  Sehe  die euch schauen und ihr SCHAM Verlieren  und schon Mit 10 die schlimmsten  perversen sahen begehen.
6:55 how do you even do this move? I look so stiff when doing it 😪
Ich habe das Video mit Hanteln gemacht und es war echt anstrengend, hat aber auch so viel Spaß gemacht👍
I normally never comment on your videos but this one made me sooo happy. A year ago I would never have thought about being excited to workout, especially not to dance-workout because I think I am so bad at dancing and sports. But well, as I am just at home since March I decided I need to do sports and because of you I even like doing it. Thanks Pam <3
A lil gangster, lmao
allgemein fände ich so lieder, die man aus dem Club kennt meeega. Auch einfach deshalb, weil man da so ewig nicht war.... Da würde schon allein durch die erinnerung eine meega energie kommen.. so wie bei LOW
Der absolute Inbegriff von: SPort macht glücklich!
I was having a party in my room, your dance workouts always SMASH!
Fire
These were the best 10 minutes of my life! The last two songs were just so much fun!!!
I can get downe with this. As in I could pass out in 3minutes 😆
What the f.... fucking love it <3
My throat is on fire 🤣
this was sooo fun!!!!
I did this workout n trust me people it's soo damn osm  n amusing... pls try it
Love it so much thank you xxxx💗🇬🇧
I can't believe you actually made me shake my booty like that Pam. You're a wizard.
Stellt euch zwei Zahnstocher mit nen Streichholzzündkopfes als Kopf vor, die Pantomime machen :D :D :D Fitness hin oder her aber Iss doch Bitte ein wenig mehr, die Welt leidet genug an Hungersnot! Deine Beine scheinen ja bald zu Brechen! PS.: Mach mehr Übungen für deinen Hintern, den von dem ist nix zu sehen außer Beckenknochen! #nofront #BischenFleischmusssein #zudünn #NormalisBesser

Die jungs wissen warum wir hier sind
So fun, made me sweat a lot it was amazing thank u
This was so fun🙌🏻♥️
Loved it❤️ The Best.
First time I wished the video would be 15 min long
I actually had more energy after this dance workout!! so much fun!!! I want this in the program every week !!!
I enjoyed that more than I thought I would
Why are you strecking your arsch in the Kamera
Alles klar
WE NEED CHRISTMAS MUSIC DANCE WORKOUT!!!!
Rock workout when? I know it might be not your thing but it would be amazing workout i think
The best workout ever
Just love itttttt 💯💯💯💯💯
This is probably my favourite workout!!!!
Dance workout, my favourite always
Das ist das erste Workout, dass ich nicht mag. Zu soft und zu shaky 😉
I clicked on this thumbnail thinking it was Jess’s Rhodes
Amazing 🥵😍
I looooooooved it so freaking much. A different way of working out  yet so funny and killer 💪🏼
This was a fun warmup before my weightlifting.💪🏾💃🏾
Love it!!!!
THAT WAS SO FUN
Was ein drecks workout. Nenns doch gleich tanzen
Great Video 😍😍 hopefully soon there will be a Christmas dance workout as well 😍
Best dance workout so far! so happy!! :)))

This is my favorite dance workout  ever! 🤍 So in love with this 😍
i loved it so muchhh

😏💖❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍
this is now my new fave workout
So skalieren, digitalisieren & automatisieren kleine oder mittelständische Unternehmen. Die Komplettlösung made in Germany. @t
I love itttttt I love it thank uuuu it brightens ones mood❤️❤️❤️
I love the last part. Nice sweat
Je suis française, je te remercie Pamela pour cette vidéo qui m'a tuer dans tout les sens du termes ;) Merci!
Me: decides to do this at 1am and hopes i won't make much noise Floor when level up comes on: "CREEK CREEK SQUEEEK"
Skinny 🤮
It was waaay easier than other dance workouts, but I still enjoyed it soooo much😍 My favorite is still happy dance, I know it by heart😌
Kannst du demnächst mal ein Weihnachtsspecial machen ?  ich bin gerade voll in Weihnachtsstimmung und da wäre ein Video mit Weihnachtsmusik schon echt nice
Congrats trending19
Thank you so much for this incredibly funny dancce workout!!! It put a smile on my face nearly the whole time through!! Especially the booty shaking parts in the end 😍😍 this is how you start your day right!!
Hey Pamela☺️ das Workout hat super Spaß gemacht! Aber ich würde mir total wünschen dass du mal Dance-Workouts auf höherem Niveau machst. Ich finde (vor allem vergleichsweise zu deinen sonstigen Workouts) haben die Tanzvideos nur das Niveau eines Warm-Ups, bis auf das Ende vielleicht😃. Fände es richtig cool wenn die Tanzworkouts noch anstrengender wären und nur aus zackigen Liedern bestehen ☺️.
Ihr muss doch auffallen dass sie 0,0 tanzen kann und es absolut affig aussieht
$10.9k - $174.3k ESTIMATED MONTHLY  Was mache ich nur falsch in meinem Leben :D
by far my favourite dance workout!!!! love you pam!!!
I laughed my ass off, so funny the ending. Made it together with my best friend via video call, and she promised me to play the video at my next birthday where i have to dance it 🤣 Great fun! Great exercise! Thank you Pam
da geht einem am Ende doch echt die Pumpe, hätte ich anfangs nicht erwartet :D
Hi Pamela, I love all your workouts and was specially waiting for this fun one! But I also think that using the term ‘gangster’ by referring to R&B music may be offensive to those for whom R&B music is part of their culture. You may consider just to change the title for this one. Having said that, thank you a lot for all the free content and the company you’re keeping us in this period! Love from Italy <3
So glad I didn’t skip this workout, so fun and now my favorite .
I bin gestorben... mehr als 10 jahre kein sport und jetzt bin ich tod... also für jemanden wahrscheinlich aufwärm programm für mich als anfänger top
400k views damn no wonder most people are fat lmao
Bru you can’t call this workout
Alleluia 1 h repeat https://youtu.be/rdlT2SD2MDE
i loved this sooo much and i truly felt connected with the music and dance movies! 😂 my favorite part was the high knees and shake at the end, might have to redo the workout just for those haha. love you pam ❤
idk why but the gansta squats are so funny
I was laughing the whole time, I can't believe you tricked me to do a workout! would love a badass dance workout next time. :D
i love iitttttt
After happy sweat this is my second fav... love you pam!!! ❣️❣️❣️❣️ you killed me!!
https://youtu.be/Pb1fc3UST6s
Iss mal was. 😆
When level up came on I just did the royal family dance😂
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Omg this is my favorite dance workout yet
She did this 4 times in a row!??!
OMG  so amazing !!!!!
If you love both Pamela reif and madfits workouts, you’ve probably done madfit’s level up song workout as well. Which is perfect! Now I have 2 different fun cardio workouts to do with this song!!!
that was amazing  Pam we want more of it.... Please post part 2 tooo
For an ‘R&B’ video, you had NO rhythm.
MY FAV WORKOUT OF ALL TIME.
I really love your dance numbers!
SO FUN
Omg can you do a Q&A ❤️
SAKYO? nani
You did the impossible, Pam. You got my dad to join in the dance routine when Flo Rida’s "Low" came on !!
Omg "low" brings back so many memories My middle school dance song xD
Alter muss ich die jedesmal in den Trends sehen?
This one was so fun!! Love u Pam !
pam I loved this workout omg tysm!!!
This was great hahah Thanks Pam, loved it. I should've worn a bra for the end tho
Love these dance workouts keep them up!!
wooooohooo!! good morning to me <3
i loveeeeee the captions for the workouts
I love It 😍
Als ob das jemand macht Hahahaha
Dennis is nuts. I could listen to these tunes and watch my missus do this forever.
An alle Damen da draußen: Provokantes Arsch in die Kamera strecken ist nicht nur fremdschämend sondern ist auch alles andere als ein sinnvolles Workout.
She should definitely include Dua Lipa's Levitating in her next dance workout! Do you agree with me?
Could you give us more no jumping apartment friendly workout, please? Thank you Pam.
Anyone else think it was over when Low ended, just to get slapped in the face with the sweatiest part of the whole dance?! 😂😂
This was so good I had to do it 2 times and I want to keep doing it forever. Love the vibe, the moves. The dance omg that was SO MUCH FUN. Loved it 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Definetely one of my most favorite dance workouts from Pam ❤️
So much fun!!! You rock Pamela!!
I look like a worm while doing the shake-don't be shy move 😂
I feel like I’m a little kid doing Just Dance again
Rn I miss when the timer had a bleep for when to finish doing the dance move 😩😩😩
That was the most enjoyable workout I have ever done in my life!!!! Pam you are amazing!!❤️❤️
Also an der Liederauswahl sollte nochmal gearbeitet werden. Das grenzt ja an Körperverletzung.
a proof you dont need an ass or boobs to get clicks as an influencer
Good idea for a video. But it's not "gangsta"
Um... can we have like a 45 min workout just like this one.  This was soooo fun!
Leg day for me today but I couldn't not do this!! Was so fun
PLEASE DO MORE VIDEOS LIKE THESE!!! Oh my God that was so much fun!! Didn't even feel like a workout... I love how you incorporated the "low low low" and "level up" to match the song!! Amazing :D Please, please create more videos like this one! Woo0o0o!!!
Die figur können auch nur frauen schön finden, da fick ich lieber meine knochige hand
Words cannot express how much I loved that workout

Love your dance workout 😍❤️

Om walkout
I was so tired and this workout gave me energy and made me feel alive, thanks! :D
I do your workouts for myself and because I can't stand that a girl who is just two years older than me, has this beautiful body and I still look like a stick on the field. grrr. one day I will catch you Pamela
Yo ich mache Fitness Motivations Videos wär phänomenal wenn ihr reinschaut ;)
I love it! It just feels so badass and dope. :D ♥ Can't wait to try this one. :3
This one sneaks up on you for sure😓💜 so fun
That was so fun that I did it twice :D

Bin nur zum Wixxen hier, wer noch?
I'm used to the beep sound at the end of the exercises and I was doing the hip shake til the middle of the video lmao
Geniussss!! The best one so far
Ich konnte den „low“ Tanz schon auswendig weil ich ihn in der Story so oft gesehen habe dass ich ihn automatisch gelernt habe😂

PAMELA you nailed it!! Love this so much! Made it so fun and my heart rate was up up up
I had so much fun while doing this workout! It's definitely not novice, but I feel like Pamela can actually teach me to dance- a task no one has ever succeeded in before😂
LOVE IT !!!

The best song dance workout!! we need more like this, Pam!

It was such a funny Workout 😂😊 The names of the Dance Moves are brilliant 😎😂😄 At the Beginning I thought "why it's just 10min?" ans in the end i thought "was that really 10min? Felt like mich more.😅" Your Dance Workouts are great. Burning Calories without the Feeling of working out 😄👍🏻
Bitte bitte mehr davon
actually it's really easy. Good luck tho
Omg, i love this dance workout 😍💕💕
Times like these when I remember that I really can't dance but it was fun I'm dying on my floor right now after the last section

I reached till let it rain and I was like I need some chicken noodle soup with soda now 😂😂.... My bones cracking
I wish I could like this twice!

Mein persönlicher Favorit von allen bisherigen Dance Workouts!! LOVE IT!

I cant wait to go back to the club with Pam´s killer choreos! I can imagine seeing someone on the other side of the dancefloor doing the same routine, and just nodding at each other like we are in a secret club :D love you Pam!!!!! <3
Yo who else was having fun until “Level Up”?! That track KILLED 😂 thank the lord for Pamela giving us these workouts 🙏🏼

Supeeer Pamela...
Loved the workout it was super funnnn also the end was amazing
Never knew i could look so shabby. But anyhow I had fun
uh it was the best!!!! 😍
Am I living or just waiting another Happy Workout 😭
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps9tEMJeBJI&t=1012s  with lofi its beautiful!
LOVEDDDD THAT NEED MORE! so much funn
Everytime I see workouts like this: No way, I cant move like that....hey but It looks fun, lets try!
Just a note guys Pamela said they had to film this 4 TIMES! 4 TIMES! before she can even nail the dance moves 🤣 So don't give up guys, if she can do this I know you can too! Just feel the music while dancing 😉
Hahaha, she took the song Level Up literally XD
YOOOOO WHEN LEVEL UP CAME I LOST IT
This is so much fun. Thank you ❤️
Me doing the "Low" dance: ok, hands go here, my legs should be like this, and then I've to move my arms and do a kind of squat pulses. When I learnt the whole dance: 03segs rest Me: 👁️👄👁️
The title really suits the workout!!!!!!
Pam that was so different and amazing, it tottaly boosted my mood and energy. Thank you, you deffinitely make my days better <3333
Omg this dance rocked. I love it ! Thank you Pam!
Christmas workout would be amazing
last song was so fun i loved it!!!! u should really do more workouts like this:)
Das ist wie die Song-Workouts nur als langes Dance Workout. Ich fands gerade schön, dass bei den Dance Workouts die meisten Übungen 30 Sekunden lang waren und ich nicht die ganze Zeit auf den Bildschirm starren muss. Ich finds auch echt unmotivierend wenn man kaum was merkt weil man ständig durcheinander kommt oder anhalten muss weil man die Choreo nicht checkt. Ich komm mir bei dem Workout so dumm vor, halte mich lieber an die anderen.
I didn´t know that I am so bad at coordinating my body especially when it came to the double whooper..
How much calories it burns?
the most fun workout ever i swear. thanks pam , love all the way from India!!!
it was so fun. thank you
This is without question, the best workout I've ever done
I had so muchh fun doing this and the coregraphies were amazing especially the flo rida low love it thanks Pam😍❤
this was NEVER 10min!!!! It was 5min not more! NOT POSSIBLE...
this is my favorite dance workout by far!!!
This is the most vanilla shit I’ve ever seen, no hate. I love it, it’s hilarious 😂
OMG!!!! I really, really LOVE IT!!! <3
I felt so cool doing this dance workout, probably looked lie a stick trying to wiggle tho
It’s definitely a torture for someone like me who have very serious dance impaired problem but I still finished it. So hilarious tho.🤐

Cringe
First 2 songs are so relaxing and I was hoping all work out to be like this but...
I luv level up
weird hips
Definitely the best dance workout so far
"Just learn the dance"  you over estimate me again Pam
I hate High Knees, but this one on the beat was so cool and fun. Thank you (again) for keeping me/ us fit during our second total Lockdown in Austria ❤️🙋‍♀️
Short and sweet...😁❤👍
favorite one so far!!!
Interessant wird es ab 6:46. dankt mir später Jungs. 👌🏾😂
That workout is so great, but the side to side in the end killed me because of the booty day yesterday. But can we please talk about how much fun Low was? I love it soooo much, just want to say thank you :D
Love love love love
the best dance ever, thanks Pam! :)
Was soll das jetzt bringen ? Da verbrenne ich mehr, wenn ich 15 min wie gewohnt dancehall  tanze und am durch powern bin.

I Like ittt but i feel like its too easy for a Pamela workout lol
I already did this 2 times and learned it by heart and then I go to study and take notes and I barely remember what I am studying about lol
This is a fun workout Pam. Been doing your workout since week 17 and so far this is my most favorite workout vids, from 68 kgs I am 61 kgs now. Thanks Pam! 💖 Greetings from PH! 🇵🇭😊

Pamela teaching me how to dance at a club 😂😂
I liked the other ones way more. Nice but nothing I want to do all the time like the other dance workouts
Thanks Pamela! I so wanted a 10 minute dance workout. Plus the titles of the exercises made me laugh! Can't thank. you enough! <3
At the beginning: *those moves are so easy is this really a Pamela Reif workout* By the end of the video: *I was wrong. So wrong...*
I did it twice and I am so tired but I can do it a third time because this workout just makes you happy. Thanks, Pamela for motivating us during COVID-19 time.
Omg I loved it😍 the perfect combo between dance and workout, at the beginning easy and in the end a little bit intense 🤩 thank you so much Pam ❤️
Me at the beginning: oh that's quite easy, even a bit too slow? Me at Ciara's level up: I CAN'T DO ANOTHER HIGH KNEE IM STILL STUCK DOWN THERE ON MY SIDE TO SIDE SQUAT
I LOVE THIS!!😻😻😻
Me: omg is this a dance workout I wont die at? Pamela: Did you really think I'd just forgive and forget? NOOO Me after Level up: I SEE REEED
IT'S SO FUUUUUUUUN! I LOVE IT
1 year ago I used to go low in the club now the only time I go low is while working out with Pam
wheres the timer bleeps 😭😭😭
Wow! This is really the coolest dance workout ever!!! Thank you, Pam, you are amazing!
Can anyone please tell me, whats the name of the shoes?? Great workout Pam 👌
I absolutely love it😍 This was probably the first time I really enjoyed dancing and I went craaazzyy😂 Had to do it 2 times! Thanks Pam!❤️❤️

Before  knowing  pam the word "double  whopper " had  a totally  different  meaning  to me 😁
THIS DANCE IS SO CUTEEEEE
9:29  I swear I look a worm while doing the SHAKE DONT BE SHY 🐛🐛
this workout is so fun!! even though I don’t know how to dance very well I can still follow and have fun💖 thanks pam for releasing this fun workout🤍🤍
the last part surprising me !!! i like it
Dieses Workout ist der Hammer! Es macht soooooo viel Spaß. Ich bin nur froh das mich dabei niemand gesehen hat 😂
honestly I didn't like this dance too much :(
Apparently it only took a world pandemic for me finally start working out ❤ Thank you for always motivating me Pamela! I wish you all a great day and I wanna recommend you another amazing song for your workout playlist: Benedict Ammann - Love ain't cheap This song always motivates me to work out so I hope you'll love it too ❤
"A little gangster" excuse me what ?
Pamela is wonderful, but I don't live dance workout, it's to simple for me and sometime don't follow the beat. But maybe is becouse I'm a dance theacer.
Mega dance workout🎵💃 aber high knees nachm leg day 😲🙈😂.....btw wer ist schon in der disco zu flo rida in die knie gegangen ❤🤗
Where do you find these amazing songs 😍, I wonder what your playlist looks like 😏
This is now officially my fav workout!! Thanks you so much pam! My favourite bit was when we had to learn the dance!
Do more dance workouts. .I only do dance workouts what make me feel so good , don't feel like working out but still enjoys a LOTTT . XOXO💚❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pamela! I love your dance workout routines, this one is definetly my new favorite. I love the songs that you've used and on top of that all exercises are perfect for me. It's extremly hard to find some good workouts so I'm very grateful for this one <3. Day one complete - I will give you an update after a week (I hope it will motive me to do it every single day)!
Sorry if I must say it but in your dances there are always same movements with arms Andi hips that are pretty worthless
The third song is really a mood!!! Love it💖
Happy bc of food😂😂😂
❤❤😍😍
So fun, thank you!
I'm covered in sweat, it's my 2nd day following up your workout plans, and let me tell you I never felt more motivated, I love your work 🙌🏻
Omg this was so cool and I had so much fun! My new favourite dance workout,  thank youuuu Pam 💕
9:42 "happy bc of food" - sounds like dennis :D
this looks so much fun! love it
Yesss I have been waiting for this! Love all of your dance workouts but this just might be new favorite :)
I really feel like I cannot be seen doing these moves. *can’t do dance moves I look too awkward I think. BUT I need to do Day 2 AND burn calories. So make sure to close the door and curtains and let’s do this👍💫
I can't wait to do them  tonight :) Edited : This was so much fun :D
You're amazing, Pamela! I really love this video, it's awesome, full of energy! 🤩 Love it! ❤️
OKKKKAAAYYYY!! I have to admit this was REALL FUNNN 🔥
I loved iittt. Go girl💪🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️
So perfect ..thanks Pam I think the last two songs are perfect because the moves and the songs are on the same quick and happy beat
I gotta say I was kind of sceptical if I would enjoy the workout. I'm so glad I tried it anyway! The music choice was amazing (as always) and the dance at the end was really easy to grasps, even for a body clown like me. <3
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes love it
yippee best thing of this week's quarantine! I live for these dance workouts
what does R and B means ? :0
At first I was like "oh seems like a moderate workout" Then came the high knees and I'm still gasping for air
When I'm working out the 3, 2 and especially the BEEP noise when the next exercise is coming anoys my dad so much that i have to play different music or really low volume.. The last BEEP is louder than the music. Is there any way to replace this?
Just watched this during breakfast because i was too excited ☕
I’m just trying to understand...why you forgot us? Uncoordinated people 😫 I’m watching it before and still can’t get the passes right 🤦🏼‍♀️ Someone help me please
Omg 😍 my new favourite video by Pam. It flew by ... I wanted it to keep going 😂
I like the dance moves on the last 2 songs😊 Soo fun 😊
Okay but why is the happy bc of food so accurate, like I really do a tiny dance when I‘m excited about food 😂🤭
hat soooo mega Spaß gemacht!
dance bc u got food  me - dances intensily than ever before
can't wait for this workout! Just in case you forgot, bilibili also needs your love!
This is nice for a warm up.
Christmas dance workout, or disney dance workout plzz pam!
This was soo FUN. I really loved the hiit part.
LOVEEEE THIS ONE 🥰
I like the old videos better, here's why: 1. In the past 2,3 months the videos are mostly about the unbelievable locations, expensive clothes, makeup, hairstyle... I mean, Pamela is beautiful even without this much makeup  2. " showing of" that how perfect she and her life is, is annoying for regular people like us🤪 who dose workout like her seriously? Putting on a lot of makeup, wear expensive dresses... 3. Personally I have been switched to "caroline girvan" channel for a while,  she is more real and more about the workout and not about beauty and perfect life. I am going to have a lot of dislikes,  I know that 😉😅
I love Pamela a
it’s the only workout of hers i can do without dying ahahahah
Loved it!
Yes so excited!
Well... I must say... You got me surprised in that "level up" song :D but it was so great!!! <3
I don’t think I look so sexy doing it  , I look confused 😂
level up dance is so cool
IVE BEEN WAIIIITING FOR THIS R&B WORKOUT, FAV SONGSSS
Level up level up...💕💕💕who else lovee the endingg?
my favourite dance workout so far! <3
She wasn’t lying when she wrote the last song is similar to Hey Mama in Happy Dance Workout😏
how amazing would it be to have a tiny little pam at home that motivates you every day, does workouts with you and dances with you?
Didn’t exercise during the entire video, was just watching her dancing 🤷‍♂️..amazing 🎶
I always have so much fun doing your dance workouts!!! ❤️❤️❤️
YESSSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS❤️
"Don't be shy"?  There's a reason I use YouTube videos instead of go to the gym...   ( other than ms Rona)
idk about yall but i be feeling like a bad bitty when i do the “big booty” part 🤣😏
OMG I LOOOOOOVED THE LAST SONG AND THE MOVES
Haben Grade Tag 2 vom sweaty and hard Plan gemacht. Hat super Spaß gemacht. Wobei ich sagen muss, dass ich auf mehr Lieder wie Low gehofft hätte oder zumindest mehr so Powerlieder wie das letzte Lied. Die ersten beiden sind irgendwie nicht so schweißtreibend und eher gemütlich. (Und mir gefallen die ersten beiden Lieder nicht, aber das ist ja eher eine subjektive Meinung)   DANKE für deine tollen Workouts und Pläne. Habe durch dich schon 9kg verloren! 😊  Viele Grüße aus dem schönen Niederbayern 😊❤️
The end of the workout is soooo freaking good 🥵
Well i didn’t expect the last song hahaha it’s actually really fun to do those dance workouts even tho I look like a wounded puppy doing those moves ...
loved loved loved loved it!!!! a little party in my  living room!! especially that part of learn to dance... hahaha ;) great job Pam!
Yes :)
Das tat heute morgen echt gut und hab auch gute laune bekommen während des Workouts
Decided to start doing you workouts yesterday by following the weekly plan you set on your Instragam. I am so happy I did, because these exercises are so fun! Keep up the good work, you just found yourself another fan! eheh
I do your workouts in the evening but when I saw this video I just wanted to do it now. Thanks for turning sports into something I love doing 🙏
Am I the only one who had to hold my boobs during the last song lol
‘Food is ready - dance’ - Pam’s Humor is next level
Knowing it's been filmed four times makes me appreciate it even more 😂
I normally hate this kind of music but if Pamela would be a DJ and play exactly this music, I would book her
wow. like wow 😍😭😩
Omg yessss
Alright Pam.. I'll try, as long as you know that even the rats in my house are gonna laugh at me
I'm just asking.. Isn't that move at 6:38 bad for your knees? I was told that if you go that deep down, it's harmful for your joints, they can get injured easily. What do you think? @Pamela Reif
wow you are ao cool
Liebe einfach die Dance Workouts sie machen mir immer gute Laune
The most amazing workout I have seen tell yet seriously enjoyed a lot 😄😄
i couldn’t wait for the workout and i came to look at it👀i can’t wait for “just learn the dance” part,i’m so excited for this video pam!
Waking up with some motivation 💪🏻💃🏻
Ampelmann jump 😂😂😂😂
little did I know that the only club vibes im getting this year are from doing Pamelas workouts
Omg can’t wait!! 😍Pam rumour has it that you were a dancer in the pré-insta era?
I didnt do it yet but i know i will love it💗💗💗❤️🤩🤩✨✨✨
Hey, it's me again. Hi Pam! Another wonderful and enjoyable video, you're awesome. Do you think you can help a friend of mine?  I have a friend that is a very big fan of you and loves german culture (she's even studying German), her name is Eve. She's always watching and redoing your videos almost every day and loves them. Sadly, she broke her ankle while she was doing one of your videos (a bad landing while jumping).   Now, she's quite sad 'cause she won't be able to do exercise in a month and a half, at least, and she usually can't stop moving (she's very very active; so now she's quite under the weather). And also she would have to wait that time to wear her newest outfit (a beautiful Puma outfit you recommended).  So, even that I don't really even know if you'll read this, I thought that least I can do is to try to contact her idol and to beg her to send Eve her best regards in a video (she's from Spain); to help her recover faster and return to her usual loved workouts!!!! So, please, could you send her your best regards in a video? 🙏  Very big hug to you from Emily! 😊
Omg i love it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
8:33 thought it was the beep😂
Miss the Timer in the beginning. But it's anyway good!!! Love the End.
9:16 wait for a sec.. Me: there's a break😍😌😛💃
Nice! Dance workout is my favourite!
Pam, FINALLY! A workout I'll enjoy actually doing it
Cool but so R&B is gansta? 🧐 saying cause your description
YAAAAAAY PAAMELA🎉🎉🎉🎉💥
I wish I could move like Pamela
Geil 😍❤️ das hat so Spaß gemacht und sich gegen Ende so gesteigert. Hammer!!!
Yaaaaaaaaaay to dance workouts  You’re amazing  Kisses from Italy
Make more dances
Cool stuff!
WHO WANTS A 20 MIN DANCE WORKOUT ? I ENJOYEEEED IT AF
I started with day 1 of the work out plan and did this workout after the "you will survive" booty day...   This was EXACTLY what I needed :-) just a fun workout w/ a sweaty end... I especially loved song 3 and 4  Lots of love from Austria!!!
I think the high knees on the beat are my favourites. Feels like not I‘m dancing on the beat but I puport the beat 😍
‘happy because of food’ I could relate so hard
Please next it be a Kpop dance workout 🙏💕
This was so fun!
I loved this!!
My favorite part is prolly "Food is ready" but no seriously I loooooove the last part more of those plsss!
I will definitely not be shy and try to be the best dancer just for food 💃🏻
Tolles Workout. Richtig coole Moves 💕🌸
Million Thanks Pam, is "A bit Hard",  guess need to practice some more to follow the bits and the movement. Cheers
loving all your vids! :D
Why only 10 min??!!  Can you at least do 30 min dance cardio?
Loved it Pam Pam! Plus it wasn't that hard 😂😁 lol
I Love the new Dance workout! It makes me so happy!! And i can‘t wait for the Christmas Dance workout 😭🎅🏼
LOL at "Dennis was not amused"
I thought it was over at 7:55 but then it continued....
Hei Pam! How many calories did you burn?❤️
loved that you wrote; just learn the dance! hahaha pam - that was so much fun! thank you!
Can't wait to try this 😍 you + ciara = soooo much motivation ❤️
is this considered a workout I don't feel winded or sweaty or challenged! I miss pam's challenging workouts I hope she uploads intense workouts again
Pam-dancing, looking flawless and just being Pam Me- ooh   ow  I'm sweaty ah I missed a step oof this is hard
This was amazing start of the day! Thanks Pam, great job as usual! (love from England) 🎶💪🏻👍🏻👏🏻
😂😂😂😂😂 you're cute. This is super seasonless but you're cute.
Pamela teaching me how to dance 😭
Had so much fun doing it 💃It's a great start for the day! Thank you Pam 💕
I really really liked the last 2 songs!! So much fuuuuun!!! Best way to start the morning 💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
Double whopper, hip rolls woohoo... It looks so fun!!!
I am very bad at dancing. Lets see how this video works for me 😜
I must do it twice! I love it!
love this 10min one i can pair it with the happy sweat one😅
Pamela was really enjoying her self in the last move😂
awesomee
Can we take a moment to appreciate the effort in all the details of her work? Like the outfits are always matching the settings and she always has motivational music, and she wears a smile almost the whole time! This is such a gift especially because it’s free! Thank you Pamela!!!
I’m offended that “double whopper” is just a dance move. 🍔
I didn't expect the last song 😂
Are there bots in YouTube to dislike videos too?😂😂  Like imagine coming very early and watch a good video only to dislike it in the end.. such a pathetic and boring job.. must be a bot.. 😂😂😂
Please please do christmas themed workouts😍
Soo cool everything 🥰
Love love love 💕
If this is not the best dance excercise on youtube !! Idk which one is
I literally loved this dance workout! Especially the last part! It gave me so much motivation amd emergy to study for the rest of the day 🥰

Whenever I do Pam's sexy dance.. Me: mom look I am looking so sexy right? 🙈 Mom: Well, someone will need special eyes to see a sweaty potato  sexy 😂 Me: 🤐🤐😭
Was so fun, but need practise for this one :D
I wish no one will happen to see me while i am doing this.

YAY!! ANOTHER DANCE WORKOUT! SO EXCITED TO TRY THIS ONE OUT!
Omg... I wanna do this so bad..  Too bad I'm working now!!!!
6:24 was sooooooo damnnnnnnn FUNNNNNN!!!!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤
Ok but... Who's ready for the family's bully after seeing you doing the "shake, don't be shy" 👁️👄👁️
i‘ll look like santa claus forgetting his presents for the children during my first try of the choreography at 6:24
*The "shake, don't be shy" made me shy even when I haven't tried it XDD*
Ich fang gleich an ☝🏻☺️
It's amazing! I'll do another two or three times later today 'cause it's so cooool, thank you ^^
do you ever feel like you just want to do a workout because you feel like the exercises are so cool to watch and you want to feel sassy doing them but when you reach those exercises in the video you‘re like a dead swan going underwater? 🦢 that‘s how i feel about the last song, i can‘t wait to do it but i‘ll sweat like hell! can‘t wait tho! i‘m ready for day 2!
pam we need a latin music workout please hahaha btw this looks so fun despite the fact that i have a stiff body
Yes love dance workouts!!!
I love you Pamela
Perfect! 😍😍
how many calories did you burn? :O
Wow! I haven’t tried this myself yet, just watched to memorise all the moves, but I am already in LOVE with this workout! 🔥Especially the “food is ready” part haha
No beep sound. It would be hard for me without that
It doesn't matter how many times you have failed, you only have to be right once. 👌🔥🔥👌
Was it just me or i learnt the 3rd song choreo by watching this video one time? *Pam made me a dancer tho XD*
Damn 10 minutes of happy-go-lucky
TRYING IT RIGHT AWAYYYYYYYYYYY
Yesss this queen makes working out so much more fun 🤩
If you try this just shaking your head to the beat while laying down on your bed it’s easier, I swear😂
