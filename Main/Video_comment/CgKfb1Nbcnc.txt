i actually cried of laughter
"lEMonAde" And "Im TWelVe 🥺👉👈" was so funny what 😆
Why is this soo funny
I saw the animation before the real thing lmao
Sapnap predicted 2025 lol
I guess he meant to sell for 50 cents, but he is accidentally selling for 50 dollhairs
With inflation, $50 for lemonade sounds pretty normal to me
who's here in 2025
😂 I won't pay 50 Rs for a glass
When he was stuck on the chair I laughed so hard 1:29
I love how just FULLY COMMITED dream is to screaming.
I mean let's be honest, in the U.S's current economy? $50 is a pretty hard bargain to pass on.
0:09 Pretty sure 12 yo don't speak like that.

This is why you don't sell lemonade for $50 because your dad might put you in solitary confinement and disown you
I’m 12 sapnap must be like 8 maybe 6 he doesn’t sound 12
50 dollars are you joking  Yea
Dream, Badboyholo, George and sapnap ready to sad dream said” you are disgusting”.

George: “Why you yelling at my son?” Dream and BadBoyHalo: “YOUR SON IS SELLING LEMONADE FOR 50 DOLLARS” *Sapnap acts in a weird way*  George: “O_O Son, you are disgusting”  Dreams Brain: Get out of here! (Dream just walks away)
He sells the lemonade and dram buys it and he realises that is actually solid gold
Must be very good lemonade and takes long time to make he surely does not deserve to be yelled at
$5 is still insanely expensive
Plot twist: he was trying to say 15 dollars.
Lol

I love over priced lemonade
The creeper on the roof be like: ;(
Sapnap is 12 years old, I'm around that age too, and yet I'm too scared to even go out into my backyard-
Hi I’m 12 :D
ISTG THESE R SM ENTERTAINING.
NOOO IT MAKE ME SAD WHEN SAPNAP LIKE *🥺🥺😢😢* PLSSS ..

Plot twist he was selling a jug of lemonade for 50 dollars
SIR YOU ARE DISGUSTING!    *there’s something a kid would wanna here from there*
😆😆😆😆🤣👍
50 dollars for lemonade!!! Soon… Sapnap sells water for 100 dollars a glass
First i thought bad would say " What a great prize
1:27 Dream, George, and Bad: ones who bully someone who is getting depressed (you dream hater who keep reminding Dream of his mistake)  Sapnap: depressed (stop bullying dream)   Seriously, this isn't a joke. Dream is getting bullied still from something he did. He did a mistake, all people make a mistake. That doesn't mean you come to bully Dream and his fan community. We're human, we make mistakes no matter what. Dream is depressed from everyone who bullies him. I'm not on the "dream stan" side nor the "dream stan stopping" side. I'm on my own side aka "stop bullying" and that's something I'll never change.

when you dont add the lamb suace:
One time me and two of my fiends were selling lemonade and cakes. We earned 300€. Today I ask myself how we earned that much money. (It was for charity but it is still a lot.)
R.I.P Headphone users

Dream is really Kid freindly
News report: 1456 people are screaming at 12-year old kid for selling 50$ Lemonade.

Tommyinnit should be in the kid role
Plot twist: sapnap meant 5$ but he doesn't know the word for it
Bet you people irl would really buy lemon juice for 100 dollars if it was sold by a celebrity
Um.... If sapnap is George's son soooo dream is shouting at his own son?
Dream’s dad joke
0:47 yes
I think the best line is the  *SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING*
**Dad texting his son to Pay $5.0 for each Cup Lemonade**  His son - I think he meant $50
So.Are we just ignoring the fact that George called Sapnap his son  Edit: ik it’s a skit but it’s really funny not to ignore 😂
😝😝😝
Wtf
Dream:what 50 dollars Mrbeast:take my all  money
I was ready for BBH or George to say "$50? WHY SO CHEAP? RAISE THE PRICE, COME ON!"
Why is it so expensive XDDDD
50 dollars?!?! What!!!
Either that kid has problems we just really want some money (I’m talking about sapnap)
Kid slaps POV: getting yelled at grown men....
Just most expensiv!
Nemonade
poor Sapnap
And here in India we get lemonade for less than 50 cents...
😂😂😆😆😂😂😆😆😂😂
I became one with the tea kettles
Plot twist : 50 Dollars was just super cheap and they were all rich and it was too cheap for them 👁️👄👁️
Man, the "Son, you are DISGUSTING" was so relatable for some reason...
“Son you’re disgusting!”
Dream will u be alright if I turn that 50$ into 49.9$
Poor sapnap as he goes too the corner
Sapnap just turned into sadnap

BeltNotFound
SapNap sounding like a child and Dream wanting to help out the community might be the cutest thing I've seen in the past 5 days.       But I think that 12 year olds might have a bit more sence that that. Maybe like 7-10 is better. xD (No hate)
"You are disgusting!" Sapnap: *goes to the corner*
RIPPPPPPPPPPPP OFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:32: George: *SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING*
Does he mean 15 dollars?
I feel bad for sapnap
The real story is this kid went to a millionaire city and so he knew it was cheap but ... dis is poor town
Georgenotfound: son you are disgusting!
What is this, is this hogwards Polly juice potion
George: why are you yelling at my son? also george: SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING! me: george would make a great father        Edit: thanks so much for 200 likes!
Wait if George is sapnap’s dad, then who is the mom?
The fact that when Sapnap said $50 dollars and my battery turned from %51 to %50 is perfecto timing
Maybe he meant 50 cent
Lol so that what happens when you sell 50 dollars for lemonade lol
Plot twist: the lemonade is actually incredible enough to be worth that much
Wtf- dream is shouting XD
He is going to have a sale 49dollars and 99 cents
Poor sapnap
Sapnap voice at the start is sooooo funny
50 doll hairs

Don’t worry he has a sale to 1000 % Dollars  For giving an attitude

SAPNAP WHY IS IT 50$ I HATE YOUR LEMONADE
Tds Lemonade farm stand skin in roblox be like:
Don't worry his having a sale tomorrow, the price will drop from $50 to $49.99
Sapnap  - its only 50 dollars C:   Dream- 50 DALLARS 50 DALLARS
It should've be Tommy instead of Sapnap to make the word child real
I think it should be $5000                But you will be given 1000 cups
50 japonese dollars

Dream Shorts
Dream's scream of 50 DOLLARS made me giggle
I feel bad for sapnap 🤕😔😔
when life gives you lemons, make lemonade out of it and sell it for $50 a glass
Ladidadida🤣🤣
)lol-
Anyone else thought he was just gonna sing the duck song
Dream waddled up to a lemonade stand and said to the KID running the stand, "hey!" bum bum bum, "WHY U BE SCAMMIN PEOPLE!!!!!"
May I ask if this is an official channel of dream? Like anothe one of his channels?
I can't blame Sapnap, it's impossible to get lemonade in Minecraft
STAND POWER!
I almost die laughing when Georgenotfound says  "your'e disgusting"
Is Sapnap George and Ninjas son? Cuz didn’t Ninja say they have a kid on the way?
I dont know why. I really dont know why i feel bad for sapnap😥😥😥😭😭😭
$50 DOLLARS A GLASS??
Instead of 15$  sapnap said 50$
This is sooo funny
sapnap is not to be trusted out
You can tell that dream is rich because he said “You mean five dollars?” where i live we buy that stuff for twenty five stuff lol
omg lol
It was not his fault...... His "DAD" "GEORGE" Is colour blind
Dream: FIIfty dollars?, U mean 5 dollars? Kid Sapnap: N no I mean 50 dollars Dream: 50 DOLLARS!!!????, WHAT DO U MEAN 50DOLLARS??!!!
Plot twist: the kid was tommyinnit
Plot twist: He meant to say $15
FIFTY DOLLARS IS SOOOOOOO CHEAP WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I bet it’s some really good lemonade
I was waiting for George to say son make it $60
Yessir
I genuinely cannot wrap my head around how someone could find this funny.
sapnap seems so shy
It’s $50 worth lemonade. If you don’t know the recipe this is the recipe: 1. Lemonade from the nether backyard, 2. Sugar from the end store, 3. Clean Water from the Atlantic Ocean 4. Carved ice from ice pillars at the winter biome
I love the short voice that sapnap made :) also SON THAT IS DISGUSTING.
Dont yell at my son
tbh I thought bbh was gonna be like "That's a great price! I'll take 10"
Ummmm... what was the EXACT point of this...???

Plot Twist: The 50 dollars was just a discount.

You could have used tommyinnit in the place of sapnap coz tommyinnit is a child and a scammer
Evryone yelling at sapnap sapnap is like yea I love the wall let me go there
Ok teens dont talk like that my voice is deeper than sapnap's and im only 14
"This is my son- why are you shouting at *it* "
50 dollars? thats 2,421.08 php here in Philippines
This is my favourite video EVER
0:03 best part of the video 🤣😂🤣😂
Plot twist: It was Tommy's idea
Would of been hilarious if George said that price is a scam and to sell for 100
if george is sapnaps dad, then woudn't dream be his mom?
FIFTY DOLLARS
How much Dream Shouted 😂😂
Give him 51 dollars and tell him to keep the change
50DOLLERS wow Hehehe I'm going to be watching Dream all day long now after that
I like how he calls his son disgusting but he doesn’t know how to look in the mirror and figure out why🤡

When Bad was walking up to Sapnap and    said “$50!” I taught he was going to say “ that’s amazing”.
50 dollars for lemonade. Dream: *n o* 1000 dollars for ksi to swear. Dream: *YES*
Nobody: Dream: screaming at kid sapnap bc the lemonade is $50 even though he has gold in his hand Edit: I had to correct hold to gold-

This is the top 1 longest skit they did
Is this legit dream team shorts because it seems legit.
Did anyone else predict George was the dad of Sapnap in this short because I actually did (SERIOUS)
No it is a good deal. There are gold nuggets in it
I think sapnap must say fifteen dollar  not fifth dollar
Plot Twist: Sapnap said 15$

😂
Poor sapnap-
Samples are for 20. Bucks
i cant stop watching this!!! lmao!!!
I thought bad was going to say that's a steal 😂
It has become part of my daily routine to watch these
The real reason it's $50 is because you pay for pufferfish(drugs) and get the lemonade for free
I feel bad about kid Sapnap now
Chill he is just a kid apperantly
God
Minecraft Lemonade Stand...
I thought he was going to bring out a giant cup of lemonade because its 50 dollars
Make more of these vids
1:24 did anyone notice sapnap jumping when he saw his “dad”
Oof
If George was the child he's excuse would be "im colorblind"
Fsr I really expected BBH to be like “fifty dollars? What a steal!”
That should be nothing to Dream
Son, that is  d i s g u s t i n g
Ngl you should sell it for 100$
Guys... dont yell at the child
Poor Sappie Nappie he just wanted some money to makehis dad proud😭
I love these

Black Friday it price 40 dollers
I think he meant 50¢

Ngl I thought bad was gonna say "50 dollars, that's a steal!" I'll take 10 glasses!"
Wait... who is the mom?it can’t be dream... so who?
sapnap is a poopoo
I was gonna say that bad should’ve played the father because in the cannon sapnaps his son but I don’t think he’d be ok with calling sapnap a “disgusting child”
maybe he means 5.0 not 50
lmao
I feel so bad for sapnap :'(
alternate title: 3 people that in age of 20's abuses a child for the price of lemonade
Damn, George went off xD
sapnap as kid called kidnap
At first, I thought this was gonna be a normal episode, but then, I laughed when he said 50 $ and argue
Dude I am 12 and I am not such a nerd
It sounds like he said 50 doll hairs
I-
Dream:”50 DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE?” Says the biggest minecraft youtuber that makes a bunch of money everyday

Sapnap getting bullied
im so sad of sapnap pls dont yall in sapnaps face its ):💔😭😭

i think sapnap just got confused between dollars and cents...
Imagine MrBeast just walk by and saw this lemonade stand selling 50 dollars for a glass of lemonade
I think I saw barely of George’s eyes
50 or 15
I feel bad for him like he is young and maybe he understood 50$ and not  50 cents (ik is roleplay)
Sapnap: Sells lemonade for $50 Dream: And I took that personally
Son u r disgusting LMAO
And scamming ppl
The 50 dollars part his shouting at a kid LMAO
Poor Sapnap...
👍
Why is this so funny I can’t- 🤣🤣

"sOn yOu aRe diSguStiNg" - Georgenotfound, April of 2021
Ha ha
Tommy innit should have been the child
50 dOlLaRs
FiFtY DollArs!?!?!??!
Dream: How old are you? Sapnap: Im twelve Dream: Thats amazing  wtf is going on here
*FIIFFFTTTYYYYY* *DOOOOOLLLLAAAARRRRSSS*
😂
Imagine bad and George ran up and yelled, “$50??? WHAT A GREAT DEAL!!”
This is the second time in a dream short, that dream has yelled at young sapnap
Poor sapnap it wasn't his fault actually George dream and badboyhalo were being motherflipping bthiches.
I thought this was a pee joke..
Sapnap:*said instead of fifteen fifty* Absolutely everything:I'M GONNA KILL YOU WHAT THE FUC
1:06 BBH: 50 dollars? Dream: Yeah BBH: A Glass of lemonade Dream: One glass fifty dollar BBH: THATS A RIP OFF!! George: Stop this is my son why you angry at him? Dream and BBH: Yeah your son selling 50 dollars of glass of lemonade George: Son you are disgusting   Edit: Thanks for the 194 likes Stay safe❤️
Dream: How much lemonade of glass? Sapnap: 50 dollars Dream: Eh  0:29
lol dream yelling at sapnap cause the lemonade is 50 dollors 😂😂😂😂
We saw dreams face reveal right
Thats how kids are blind $5.0
I kinda feel bad for kid snap after all three were yelling at them
We need more kid Sapnap this is adorable-
I feel bad for sapnap  because dream and bbh were yelling at him
This is a really good representation of how I feel when I look at the price of your merch  Btw before everyone gets mad, this is just my opinion. I am not sending hate towards him in anyway.
I never knew that dream could be a Karen
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These are always so funny XD
He spat everywhere
Lmao 😂
I think sapnap will feel bad about himself
I thought bad was gonna say “50 dollars? Wait, it’s on sale!”
Make another part pls
Sapnap kid voice is cuuuuuteeeee
maybe he cant spell 15
Is that really dream roleplaying?
No its $50 because George bought limes
rip random child who doesn't understand economy
George Coulda Said "Its not his Fault He's Colorblind"
hahahahhaa this one so fun
so this is their voice if they are in a manhunt.."loud"
these r so funny i also like how sapnap is like a innocent child and dream just always like screams at him in these kinds of bits lmfao
When life gives you lemons...     sell them for 50
If they could have brought in Tommy to be the child that would have been gold
Fi-fifty dollars?   Dreams entenison:WHAT THE FUC-
First, Dream wants to help Lil Sapnap, Starts to scream and then BBH comes and tries to help but joins the chat and finally the dad (A.K.A.  GeorgeNotFound) tries to defend his son (A.K.A Sapnap) but still joins the chat
LOL
At the end dream be like : ight imma head out
fun fact: sapnap actually said 15 dollar  but dream heard 50 dollars
Sapnap be like: uwaaaaa D':
Sapnap filling sad
and here I was thinking there was going to be a twist
This is my favorite dream shorts
Ok
George: Why are you shouting at my son? George 10 seconds later: Son you are disgusting
50$!!!???
LOL
is not much
But gold values more than $50....
Every time there’s a dream short  Me: oh no *clicks on it anyways*
The Lemonade was 50% of it was really costs $100
Amazing voice,Sapnap
In México: lord dream y Leidy George
Alternative ending:he meant fithteen not fithty
he's acting more like a 9 year old
It is disappointing that a 12 year old kid sells $50 per glass of lemonade but it is more disappointing that you got instantly shouted without asking to lower the price off
XD 50 dollars are pretty cheap :D :c
Everyone alternative ending:the boy get a poison flash potion and throw it to them lol
Omg this is hilarious i can’t stop laughing
“We all know how George is gonna be when he is a “dad”...                                              SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING
Alternate title: dream yelling at a 12 year old that's selling lemonade for fair prices
That’s a rip off
dream when acting: yelling = perfect
*starts beatboxing*
I feel bad...
Alternative Title: 3 grown men shout out a 12 year old child over lemonade
sapnaps kid voice is something i didn’t know i needed
these end up with dream yelling😅
Sapnap you making me Die laughing 😂
Dream should be be a actor
My favourite lemonade stand
Mr beast buying the whole lemonade stand for a video
What makes this even funnier is that BAD is Sapnap’s canonical father-
Why the hell did I just notice Sapnap’s shirt has flames on it. HOW
3 grown man yelling at a child
ITS MÈEEEE
The talented acknowledgment complimentarily attend because database ethnically amuse onto a limping milkshake. reflective, eminent olive
George was gonna go out and be like: are you winning son?
Technically that’s dreams son too
👌👌👌
George says that sap nap is a boy/son but he sounds like a girl
"50 million dollars! Who do you think you're kidnapping Chelsea Clinton!?"  - Detective Carter
Reminds me of the one and only duck song 😆😆
Poor sapnap
Me wondering how sapnap makes a kid sound
The lemonade stand kid should have been Tommy, it would've been twice as funny
By the mathematical order there is 34.2% chance that the lemons will be dirty and by the dirt on the table the the lemons have a 84% chance to have worms and thus the lemons is a rip off unless you flip the price back wards it will be 05 if you delete the 0 now you'll have 5 dollars worth
Poor sapnap
all I have to say is LOL
Plot twist: He didnt know how to pronounce $5, so he said $50 instead.
George has a son?
THEY SAY DISGUSTING IN EVERY SHORT LMFAOOO
Dadboyhalo
50 DOLLARS IN NORWAY THAT WOULD BE 500 MONEY!
FrEsH sQuEeZeD LeMoNaDe FoR sALe. OnLy 25 CeNtS.
lmao thought that George was gonna be like: "50 DOLLARS?? I THOUGHT I SAID 500!!"
LMFAO- THIS WAS HILARIOUS-
LMAO
oh my s rip off breek
Sapnap: crying George: SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING
Alternate Title: Lemonade Stands in 2090
Normally it costs $50 But it's on Sale now It costs  . . . . . $49
Dream getting mad about lemonade stands when lemonade stands when they aren't around much anymore
Poor sapnap! He must have had some good lemonade doh :/
Why is dream always the one person that shouts
What if the lemonade is made by god and it’s the greatest lemonade in the universe
He’s 12 THATS AMAZING
I feal bad for sapnap
Poor SapNap he just wanted to sell some lemonade
I love george at the end just like "SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING"
George and dream are yelling at their son... ;)
I mean if he's George's son he clearly just learned from his dad
Can we just get a 100% discount?
I have respect to that kid
I choked you almost killed me
D I S G U S T I N G
Plot Twist: Sapnap was dyslexic. Or he didn't know the difference between 5 and 50 Dollars
what did i just watch
50 DOLLARS!!!
I'm surprised there not dying of laughter
Why is dream so god damn good at yelling, wth
Bruh he was just paying for the glass too calm down
When the dad starts yelling too😂😂😂
Instead of sapnap it should be tommyint

First word: La Last word: Disgusting

*5 0 D O L L A R S*
w h o a  i am in shock
Sapnap: it’s only 50 dollars :  every one 👁👄👁
Dream's screaming 😭😭
Poor Sapnap 😭
People on the otherside of the street: *50 DOLLARS?!-*
Literally 3 grown men came to bully a 12 year old child in the middle of the street.
Oh  wow, and how much? 50$ "*FiFtY dOlLaRs!!!!!!*"
would've been better if bbh was the dad, since he is (dream smp) sapnaps father.
And then a duck came up and ask for some grapes
His impression of a 12 year old-
$50
50 DOLLARS?!!
the way i didn’t even think that was sapnaps voice-
Fun fact: this is the longest video in dream shorts
Lemonade Stand more like Lemonade Stan
Sapnap is a scammer
Son you are discusting😂
I don’t know why am I still watching this from yesterday till today I literally replayed it 100 times😂
Dweamypoo
I love the fact that the music stopped when SapNap said 50$... plus tax?
the kid in the stand should have been tommy
Plot twist: it’s 50 cents
50 dollars its fine lol
POOR SAPNAP :(
The little kid just wanted to make profit

I heard the kid Sapnap voice and started crying out “NOT AGAIN”
Who called me
Instead of sapnap it should have been big man Tommy. Now he's a real child that scams people.       We all love him though :)
I WAS DRINKING AND I CHOKED WHEN SAPNAP SHOWED UP
aww poor snapmap
"son you are discusting"
poor sapnap...
WHERE ARE THE GRAPES
It’s not actually lemonade. It’s Tree Sap that he collected while taking a nap.
What it feels like to go to a lemonade stand in Beverly Hills
Pov; you are a villian, trying to destroy the world and this is your tragic backstory
Snapnap:
Dream team on their off days be like...
POV: you came from Tik tok
I’m convinced dream just likes to yell😭
The price of that lemonade is higher than my parents expectations from me
Poor kid sappy
50 DOLLARS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING 😂😂
sapnap has a good kid voice
Poor little sapnap
BRUUUUUUHH
amazing
Lol
Son your disgusting
I guarantee you that, that recording was cut early because dream can’t keep his inner kettle wheeze
Plot twist: you can keep the glass that comes with the lemonade,  its made of gold.
imagine: ILL BUY IT dream: *ascends to another plane of existence
when bbh yells that's when you know its bad
very good video. my dad also called me disgusting one time. very relatable. 10/10
When I heard George said this is my son I though sapnap would say hi big daddy
I love how George’s called Sapnap SON you’re disgusting at the end lol
dadd
Good job Dream you made a kid cry
Hey Dream Team! Imagine you are Sapnap... how you'll feel if 2 adults and your dad are screaming at you? Shame on you 😅
Three grown man yelling on a child... it’s BriLliAnT!

Sapnap looks so sad at the end :/

I didn't understand anything but laugh ?

This feels like it's almost a birthday present to me, I love it. :>
Therapist- Kid Sapnap isn’t real, he can’t hurt you.  Kid Sapnap-
I kept expecting one of them to be like "50 dollars!?!?! What a steal of a deal, I'll take two!" but instead they just did the first punchline x3
“SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING” -George 2021

But i mean it could've been a really big glass of lemonade ya never know

Hahahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂
1:30 Awww look at Sapnap 🖐😩 Sadnap 😛
Plot twist : this had actually happened to dream irl, he's just taking out his frustration by mimicking and role-playing it in minecraft
What i love is that my 1st guess was 50 dollars too 😌
Why does no one understand, Seventh and eighth graders travel in groups
Thoughts badboyhalo was gonna instead think 50 dollars is normal then something else
What ar you doing
Fifty dollarssssss
An alternate ending could be george scalding his son for not charging more
Lemonade? More like lemon aids.
"sOn, YOu are DisGusTIng" 😭✋
i love how dreams like ur child is selling lemanade for 50 DOLLARS!
This does not have the rights to be this funny
Dream Is Karl
Inflation
So random lol
My Ears Hurt because you are shouting
$50 WHAT NOW XD?!
Son! You are disgusting! - Georgenotfound
I'm 12 and im not that stupid and my voice is not that high pitched at all 2nd lowest in my grade
This is george being a parent
This is LTT when he finds out he paid 95$ on a shitty pc case
Poor sapy napy ;-;
😂😂😃
George is such a good dad he even didnt defend hes own son
Plot twist: Sapnap selling Omega Mart lemons
50£ FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE
First 0:40 then 1:12 and then 1:24
Amazing
I feel bad for sapnap being yelled even though it role-playing
Lmao
Love you💝
sapnap has a cute voice
12 year olds still don't know how hard it is to earn money yet.
I thought my man was gonna pull out a comically large glass of lemonade
I thought there was some missed potential in this video because I didn’t really laugh, but like, i thought it was a little funny when George called sapnap disgusting
🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Alt channel name: funniest channel in minecraft
YOU.ARE.DISGUSTANG $50 DOLLARS
No one else can change their voices like sapnap

Alternate title: Dream yelling for a minute and a half.
"I MEAN, I'LL PAY, BUT DON'T DO THIS AGAIN!"
That was cruel
At least it isn’t $50.01
Wait, is this actually Dream???
50 DOLLARS?!
take a shot every time one of them says "fifty dollars."    note: *you'll die. don't do it.*
when life gives you lemons, you sell 'em for a 100 bucks apiece. No question about it.
I’m mean they don’t have to buy it
I know what this is from “YOU HIT DAD!!!!!!!!Dream:AaAAaaAAaAaAAAAAAAAAAA
Guys I think the lemonade is $50.....

Sapnap's reaction when dream said "are you kidding me": n-no :(
When life gives u lemons u make lemonade and make people pay 50 dollars.

I thought the ending would be like: The actual price would have been  $0.50
Oh my god this is a great lemonade stand 1 min later screaming 50 dollars for a glass!?!?
I’m so glad sapnap was allowed to use his real voice for this short.
I like how Georgenotfound was like "Son you are DISGUSTING!" 1:32
Kid Sapnap had childhood trauma and never made lemonade for other people ever again
Ugh all lemonaid is 50 dollars 👁 👄 👁

Hey dream is this Canon to the dream SMP or not.
"I am 12"  *says the adult*
He deserves it
George should set up sapnap for adoption
I like how Sapnap is always the kid because he’s the youngest.
Wait now George is father of Sapnap? Earlier in shots they were enjoying without letting Dream come in... So is George a Step dad??
I bet he can't pin this comment
Wait so was that supposed to be...funny?
Me being a tea kettle at sapnaps voice at the start
George: Son, YOU ARE DISGUSTING!
Dream is trying not to laugh at the end!
I thought this was gonna end with the lemonade being the most godly tasting thing ever, but nope!          *It's just Sapnap becoming depressed at 12 years old.*
When he said "50 dollars" his voice was so high i love it 😭🤚🏾
My girl just broke up with me 😭😭😭😭 this made my day thank you dream
At least Mr beast would buy it
No one : Dream after every  5 seconds : Th- that is amazing !

Sapnap: 50 dollars for lemonade   Dream: 50 DOLLARS FOR A CUP OF LEMONADE!  Sapnap: Hiding in the Corner From The Price and Gets yelled at For the Price !
No guys it’s fine, it’s just the sugar was shipped from Argentina and the cups are 1/2 a gallon
lol

When Sapnap brings back his kid voice, *You know this is quality content from your favorite homeless teletubbie*
SON— YOU ARE DISGUTI— 😂
F SapNap
I thought George was gonna say “50 DOLLARS? THATS WAY TOO CHEAP, PUT THE PRICE UP”
I think it meant 50 cents
@Jachael123 George should be dream's wife/husband
Sapnap: is twelve with a very light voice, lighter than a 4 year old's Me: a twelve year old who has a very deep voice when I am not trying to have a light voice.    oh wait-
I love how nobody realized this is a joke abt the merch loll
Toddler SapNap is back at it again. We love to see it.
but what if the lemonade was the most delicious thing ever? 🥺
lol
I'm selling lemonade           For 50 dollars only
btw if Sapnap's dad is George..then who are the momXD
God I love these short vids
I like how at the end George just starts joining the crowd and screaming at his own SON  lol
It's not a dream short if non of them shout "DISGUSTING"
This is how I feel when 5 below sells something for 6 dollars
CROUCHING SAPNAP 🥺🥺🥺
Sapnap has been shrunk into 12 year kid

Dream, George, and BBH: *Yelling at a child* Tommy: *Laughing in the corner*
This isn't how 12 year olds sound now
Dream Shorts is the future of entertainment
poor SapNap XDDD
Wow I’m always early here lol
How rude to scream at an children haha 🤣
“No no I meant 500 dollars”
I’m honestly curious if the lemonade was actually worth $50
Dream loves screaming at little kids
Turns out it was 50 cents and sapnap can’t read
0:03
As a 12 year old, this is offensive..
that's not sugar...
Sapnap your not disgusting
This is gonna sound crazy but I think BBH is voicing the kid
"Son you are disgusting"
0:08  James Charles be like
Lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love the "Son you're disgusting part" part, also George would be a wonderful dad xD
A Dream walked up to the lemonade stand and he said to the kid running the stand, “50 DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE!?”
Rip sapnap
These shorts brighten my day :D
Lol dream is more mature than badboyhalo
Imagine being a teenager and having three grown men yelling at you
i would’ve never thought i’d hear sapnap talk like that
Hello
This CHILD. CHILLLLDDDLDLDLDLD
people in adopt me be like:
I was expecting duck song parody
I like how everyone is against a 12 year old 😂😂
Maybe the lemonade was good
Pretty scenery
I legit thought he was gonna pee in the lemonade but I guess it’s just expensive
Pov:it's 5.0dollars
SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING!!. That got me lol
Cool
hello
A
I feel bad
son, you're adOP
I love how George says at the end of the video "SON, YOU ARE DISGUSTING!"
this lemonade is fifty dollars because the sugar is not actually sugar
sap needs a business license, officer, arrest him
kid sapnap is back
He just wanted to buy a gaming computer :(
kid sapnap = kidnap
I can’t get over Sapnaps voice
I laughed so hard takes so much enjoyed it
Sapnap’s voice 😂
When I was twelve my voice was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay deeper than that
I'm glad I never got to sell lemonade 😂
Plot twist: it was 50 cents
It would be soo funny if badboyhalo said noway is this a sale... 😂
He means 50 dollars a gallon not a glass:)
poor son
Don't be mad he is just a kid      and im wondering why always snapnap acting the kid character
XD
49 DOLLARS
Everybody gangsta till the little kid asks for 50$ for one glass of lemonade
imagine
i love how bad is the only one wearing clothes for some reason
gay
I like how it’s number fifty on trending,and it’s also fifty bucks for a glass of lemonade
so this is what happened when sapnap came back
Tommy should have replaced Sapnap.
....and the dream walked up to the lemonade stand and he said to the sapnap right in the stand, “hey,” bum bum bum “oh my gosh, this is an amazing stand. How old are you?”
I LOVE IT LOL
I was thinking about this at school. You give him the fifty dollars and he gives you $49.50 back. :)
No quackity would have been better at selling lemonade 100%
"Son, you're disgusting!" I always wonder what happened after that point, if George had disowned Sapnap or if Sapnap had meant 50 cents
Gogy is Sapnap’s dad, and Sapnap’s is BBH’s dad, and BBH is Dream’s dad? This family tree is a QR code Jesus Christ-
"#50 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING"
Dont worry its on sale!! 49,99
It's called _inflation._ Sorry, but you came too late.
The Lemonade Stand is made out of Terracotta from Minecraft: Dungeons.
Why does it actually seem normal for sapnap to be posing as a 12 year old
Oh my
I feel like there is a lore here.
Second time sapnap was acting like a little kid
Me as a parent be like: son you are disgusting 😂
yea, 50! such a rip-off, it should be sold for a higher price!
“Son, ur disgusting”. Where did that came from?
I love how everyone gangs up on this kid instead of the usual everyone is with the kid joke
Even the daddy is yelling his son, supportive daddy
Justice has been served
YESIRR
A
I wish they'd show bloopers xD
Plot twist sapnap doesn’t know there’s no lemons in Minecraft
George will make a great dad... Totally
1:00 The way he says "THIS CHILD!" is so funny.
sapnap is always the child
day 4 of telling him these arent shorts shorts are in 9:16 aspect ration not 16:9
I HAVE A NEW NAME FOR THE BABY SAPNAP   "Child Sapnap"
I wish they make it canon😃😃, that George is sapnap's dad
Poor SapNap, went a bit too hard there bud.
Ind the end George said sap is disgusting
“It’s freshly picked”   Me: turns to the left and sees a bottle of store bought lemondade...
I can hear dream just wheezing like a tea kettle in the background
I dont know whos writing these bits Drem, but you should fire them. lmao
I love helping      WHAT!!!!!!
Come on Dream!!!!! Upload a YT VID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will pay with a 19 dollar tip cuz I’m a good person, 69 dollars for little ripoffing sapnap
No one: 99% of dream stans:

He meant 50 cents
Dream: “Yeah! I love helping the community!”  **returns to the L’MANBERG wastelands**
what is it with sapnap and wanting to act like a kid lately

*" EH- "*

*inhales* THE DUCK WALKED UP TO THE LEMONADE STAND
From president to owning a lemonade stand. That's a sign.
I expected bad to come in and say   50 DOLLARS THATS A BARGAIN
Everyones favorite little 12 year old is back.
Sapnap sounding like a 6 year old: I'm twelve!  Me who is actually twelve: o_o
George: YOUR DISGUSTING! Me: This is why Minecraft Youtubers are Minecraft Youtubers and Parents are Parents
Omg XD 50 come on that is legit a rip of what ya doinv mannn itss just a glass of lemonoade whyyy 50 thats such a rip of

*DadNotFound*
George just calling sapnap disgusting  in the end. lol
Bro they should make a MyStreet series 😂
And then everybody comes to see whats going on and when they all found out it was 50 dollars they all start to complain

Kid sap nap is poggers
Thats me when i love money 😂😂🤑🤑🤑🤑
Lol
Fool you have never seen the glass of lemonade for all you know the glass is 6ft high 3ft wide in that case yeah 50$ is just a little over priced maybe
Why is it so underpriced?
This is so sad
Hi
maybe this is the same kid with the giant fort—someone actually bought their lemonade and they built the giant fort w/ the money
Hello
*50 dollaRs?* *50 DOLLaRs!!*
What how is he disgusting for selling 50$ of lemonade
Dreams 🩳 lol
“Son you are disgusting!” What a nice flashback to go to once your a grown up💀

I can confirm this is exactly how 12 year old boys sound.
Poor sapnap just wanted to sell lemonade and got called disgusting
Mr beast be like:  I’ll buy all of it
imagone if he actually ment cents instead of dollars
Twist its 50cents
Me if I walked up to him: FIFTY DOLLARS?!             you're having a sale?
I just realised Dream Shorts is actually one of Dream’s channels
I watched this like 10 times and I'm still laughing

I can just hear Dream trying not to become a wheezing tea kettle.

"SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING"
The best minecraft player: gives him 1 millón dollars
Sapnap back with the kid voice, he heard us!!!
WHY DOES DREAM ALWAYS SOUND SO MAD OR BE MAD IN EVERY SHORT-
If Sapnap is George's son, doesn't that mean Dream is Sapnap's dad?
0:40 dream when he speedruns and he get's killed by fall damage
sapnap: I AM TwELvE Dream: ok

As a 12 year old, 👁👄👁
I like how george said: SON YOU ARE dISGUSTING
But I don’t understand how SapNap got the courage after this for a YouTube channel!
This is 100% irrelivent but I got about 20 notifications at the exact same time
Lol, I thought Bad was going to say, “50 dollars?!? That’s way too cheap! Raise the price!”
Dream sucks.       *Now we wait*
Xdddd
"SON YOUR ARE DISGUSTING"  Says the one who is colorblind   😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
50 dollar is great deal
Fun fact, I have done this. When I was 5, I forgot to put the comma in my sign, so it said “Lemonade, $500.”          It was $5.00. XD
My dad talks to me like that too ayyyyy we match
Listen, I think he just read 50¢ wrong guys 😔
the fact that george called his own son disgusting while watching him cry in the corner-
I hope dream is ragging on how expensive his merch is
poor sapnap
Why does sapnap sound like a child?!
I love how even his dad is bullying him and screaming at him and why does bad have leather armor
Yeah you right. IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A HUNDRED SAPNAP!!! 💀
$50
50 DOLLARS⁉️
50 dollars for glass of lemonade? Who thought that was a good idea?
Too bad the duck wasn’t there. :(
SPN U ARE DISGUISTING

only if they replaced sapnap with tommyinit it would have been funier
This may make me a weirdo but i really feel bad for sapnap LOL

this is fan fiction, george is sapnaps leader
RIP for little sapnap
R.I.p sapnap
alt title: 3 grown men assult a child
Dream and George had Sapnap
it genuinely sounds like he marked the price incorrectly
It probably would have been better if he said no not 50$ for a glass 50$ for a whole pitcher of lemonade
Now that's just gready

"Son, you are DISGUSTING"
why is sapnap always a child
This is how my dad is to me.
If EA was a kid
Guys it’s okay! It’s only 49.99 now :D
l like how bbh is the only one with cloths on
Childnap just boost serotonin
Since this is a 94 second video, this isn't gonna be a '2 hours later' animation by sin3c12!
Just why
Why
When Dream's shorts videos are better than his regular videos:
Sapnap could've used his real voice because he legit sounds younger than he actually is
Rich people problems
"Son, you are DISGUSTING!"  o7
That is Amazing
We all know that the Kid sapnap stans would pay it though...
I thought george would say that you should have asked for 💯$. 😅
9 hours ago and I got the notification NOW?!?!
This gives me flash backs... 😅
50 DOLLARS IS A GREAT PRICE WHAT U GUYS ON ABOUT
fun fact: this is the second video over a minute.
Reminds me of that spongebob episode where they were selling chocolate 🤣
12 year old sapnap is cursed
Plot twist: Sapnap is telling the truth that the lemonade is actually really good (worth over $50) and marked down the price in efforts of convincing the neighbors to try some
Plot twist: the 50$ glass is giant
Me who's 12 and has seen no one in Quarantine:   Do other 12 year olds sound like Sapnap?
Dang that a ripe off
"SON YOU'RE DISGUSTING"
DREAM, IF YOU SEE THIS COMMENT, COMMENT ON THE YOUTUBE VIDEO.” IF DREAM PUTS A COMMENT ON THIS VIDEO I WILL BUY $400 WORTH OF YOUR MERCH OR COINS
Dream just buy  it  he's a kidd
bad be like: What the muffin is happening here
A homeless teletubbie just wants some lemonade
Minecraft manhunt speedruner vs 5 hunters ?
50 DOLLARS?!?!?
Sapnap sounds...                       *5 years old...*
George is Sapnap’s dad? Canon
dream screaming is something i never knew i needed in my life
George: 50 DOLLARS, THAT IS SOOOOO CHEAP
This was the best short in my opinion
Idk why but I expected a plot twist when bad came, I expected him to go, “Fifty dollars?! That’s a steal! What are you complaining about? I’ll take three!”
20 minutes later the entire neighborhood is yelling at Sapnap then he gets arrested
It's pee anyway
I love how at the end you can hear "You're disgusting!" 😂
HDWBDHBHAHBAH
I laugh so hard that I almost died 😂 lol
Imagine 10 people going and buying a $50 glass of lemonade every day oh that child will be rich
when a dream walk up to a lemonade stand, and he said to the kid running the stand "Hey" bom bom bom "50 DOLLARS?!?!?"
It’s not a scam if he lets people know the full price a head of time
Que legal não intedi  nada mais gostei do video
POOR 12 Y/O SAPNAP LMAO
I think I know what the lemonade is Insert meet the spy music  .......                   It....                           Peee
😂 LOL
theres a sale 69420$ dollars!!!
lemme be the child’s voice lol
First it was Sapnap as the kid, Then Sapnap the president, and now the kid is back!
Plot twist: He means 50 cents
THIS WAS WAY TOO FUNNY FOR ITS OWN GOOD ABAHAHH
Thank you snap snap for telling my voice is like a kid 🤣🤣🤣
Someone: "George will be an amazing dad!" Me: *Shows them this short* Someone: "I may have been mistaken..."
I was hoping bad would pay the fifty dollars
This is kinda sad tho...🥺
Gaming
50 dollars for a glass of lemonade  Mr beast: no difference
Plot Twist - He was saying 15 dollars
Hi
honestly i thought it would pan out near the end with an absolutely gigantic tub of lemonade and thats why its 50$
You know it’s funny when sapnap has that voice
All times l see this vídeos l guess its the hub
omg this vid is longer than 1 minute
Sapnap's voice is always so cool lmao
Why is Dream walking around a neighborhood when he doesn't got no home
I feel like the person who voices the kid is just the winner of playing in the manhunt for buying the shirt
I watched this like 10 times
the lore seems different here,,
DO YOU EVEN SLEEP?
God i love this channel
Me: 50$?!      ALSO ME: YOURE MUCH INSANER THAN THE VILLAGER I SAW ON A VILLAGE SELLING A BELL FOR 36 EMERALDS!! #$+$##&#&$+@/$($+$&@)$+$        TRIGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRREEEEEDDDDDDD
Wel that escalated quickly
I will never get over sapnaps child voice
xD I cried with laughter. good video ♡
i’m never going to get over sapnap’s child voice
I love how Dreams first question when he sees anyone is 'How old are you'
that 12 year old is in middle school and sounds like a baby
1:31 ''sir you are disgusting''
And They Dont Even Try The Lemonade... Welp
$50, ahh it's fine let the kid have his MONEY!
Sapnap is a kid again ✨wow✨
I like how Sapnaps 12 year old voice sounds like a 4 year old
He’s being ganged on-
i feel kinda bad for sapnap's character ngl lol
This lemonade stand kinda seems like an Apple store
Poor sapnap standing in the corner of the lemonade stand😂😂
When u forget the difference between dollars and cents:
I don't know why sapnap put on a voice he already sounds like a kid
dream's new favorite word. "DISGUSTING"
Almost 100k likes on your video congrats
"Son, you are DISGUSTING"  George is a good parent.

*"SON YOUR DISGUSTING-"*
Hear kid $50 *gives $5 dollars*
*RIOTT!!!*
When I try to sell something on eBay
Poor Sapnap.
Breaking News: 3 Adults Yells at Child for Selling Lemonade for $50   News Caster: wait.. $50? THATS A RIP OFF   [/joke]
Is this dream's literally new channel?
I can see this
Person 1: Did you here this kid once did a lemonade stand, but for fifty dollars? Sapnap (Grown up): Oh really? *nervous* Person 1: Yeah then 3 adults started yelling at him. Sapnap: *Vietnam flashbacks*
Remake it and at the end kill sapnap
**SON YOU'RE DISCOUSTING**  what a great dad
I need your help 🥺
the duck song
Like for second part  👇👇
Poor sapnap
Gogy yells at his son part 11
Plot twist :  the drink was so good they paid 500
Lololololol
Ahhh but they forgot the $50 question: in what currenc-
Poor sapnap. :(
wait emm when did george become sapnap's dad..
Sees the thumbnail: are they ganging up on him..  Watches video: welp–
$50 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!!
For being “12” in the story, his voice is quite squeaky...
Poor child
Lmao
I'm pretty sure George said you are disgusting just to tell that to sapnap and not part of the skit
they all just arrive and yell at him for $50 worth of lemonade XD
dream: how old r u? sapnap: i-im 12  me: =_= im 12 and i already know whats log means and 5282×316 lmao
"ladida dida..."
I was expecting bad to say, oh wow that is so cheap
George: son! you are disgusting!
i love how george says at the end YOUR DISCUSTING!!!
This made me feel embarrassed I just to make bracelets and price them at 20 or less or more I feel so embarrassed and people would buy them I didn't have clue about money and I was greedy I should've sold them for 4$
LOL why is this even a thing I'm assuming more and more people were just gonna come up and start yelling at Sapnap xD idk but I kinda feel bad BUT $50!!!!????
You could have just told him nicely to change the price to $5
Wait if Sapnap is George’s son then Dream is his mother? And Bad is his uncle… 😧
3 men yelling at a child ah yes, modern humor
poor sapnap press f to pay respect
Nice
This is halirious
Dreams Rich He can Afford it
I’ll just go to Timmy’s across the street. It’s the same price, but he’s selling entire pitchers of lemonade and throwing in seven real glass cups!
Here b4 1M views. Also LMAO
here before 1 million views
I really thought when bad screamed 50 dollars he was gonna say "THATS A BARGAIN!"
Millions of Dream Fans would pay $50 for lemonade if Dream made it.
Dream called him a child (tommyinnit)
I remember the video, they threw the kid across the table because he sold the lemonade for 50 or 75 dollars i dont remember
I'm 12
Your disgusting!
i feel bad for sapnap
“SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING!” 😂
I love this
I love how Dream yells for the stupidest things XD
Me this whole Video : in pain bc stomach hurts from laughing too much.
Dream don’t yell at the poor Child, if it’s $50 then it’s $50
This reminds me of the time some store was selling some electronic cleaner thing for $100 and no one would buy it so they changed the price to $99.99 and they sold out.
LOL 🤣
“Son you are disgusting” -George 2021
Sapnap dont be greedy
Dream: Oh yeah I love helping out the community!  Proceeds to scream at a child
Fifty dollars- HOW-
This is just a normal manhunt
"son, you are disgusting!" ahshshhs
Now, whose sapnap's mom
Lets see how many subs i=I get from this comment
Plot twist: Sapnap actually meant 15 dollars
"YOU ARE DISGUSTING" damn George is going to be such a great dad
I think he confused 12 with 4 I never met a 12 yo that talk like that 😭✋
"Son, you are DISGUSTING!"
Are you winning, son?
ARE YOU KIDDING?! 50 DOLLARS?!?!
*How Caillou should've ended*
Sapnap "Im 12" Discord: Oh boy here I go banning again
George :SON THATS DISGUSTING Badboy: THATS A RIP OFF Dream: WHAT ARE YOU SCAMMING PEOPLE Sapnap: crouching in the corner
near the end you can tell dream is holding back laughter while saying his lines.
DREAM  I KNOw  YOUR FACE  YOU HaVE LIKE  BLONDE  HAIR
Dude a kid was like asking me if he could have the cup back so he could use it again and I almost threw up lol
he meant 50 cents :(......
Sapsnap
The sad thing is......         .......I’m twelve
they make the 12 year old sound like a toddler
Hi notnico
HEY COME GET YOUR 50 LEMON SCAM ADE
Picked fresh from my backyard
Would have been much better if there were some satire or some kind of joke in some of these-
Why is that making me sad :(
He’ll give him the special discount 30cents off the lemonade 😁
Snapmap sounds so wired lmao sorry sapnap for calling you snapmap lol
I live for this channel ahsgdhdvbd
Why is there ... in each video
George at the end “ son you are disgusting “ opp
Lmaooo I am wheezing
Lmao
I love how we've already had Sapnap having a good place to stay as a child, Dream strolling around out of nowhere and shouting his soul out because of Sapnap
poor sappy
Dream is now only shorts making youtuber. While his main channel slowly dying..
Make a attack on titan episode
It has to be in vertical format.
100% sure they are high when they make these scripts no doubt
sappy nappy
Hahahahhahahahhahaahah
The little voice ahahha
I was deadass half expecting a pee joke
Plot twist the kid ment to say 50 cents
Ok so Bbh is Dreams Father and George is Sapnaps Dad... Explains a lot
"how old are you?" "i'm 12 years old" "t-that's AMAZING! THAT'S AMAZING!!"
Isn't this the same kid who denied a homeless man entry into his fort
Did you all see how George just agree with Dream... (As normal 🙄) He even betrayed his own son like that 😂
I think we’ve just all accepted that Sapnap is always the kid..
i would like to buy 3 glasses. yes i'm gonna pay 45$.
I love how dream and sapnap start to have a stroke at 0:14
The tough condition preferably knock because look terminally enter except a tightfisted father-in-law. oval, toothsome language
Who agrees Dream is one of the only ones who puts effort in his shorts?
Sounds like a deal
Ifunny
Dream makes videos that are like real life in Minecraft almost daily just to give us the vibe of going outside.
$50
Not so fun fact : he tried to get money so he can pay his dog's vet bills beacuse it broke his leg
50 DOLLARS
I like how dream gets mad or disgusted
funny
0:08 Dream: How old are you? Sapnap: I am 12.  Dream: 12? That's amazing, that's amazing... xDD
poor sapnap
that’s riDICulous
XD
This acting is so good 😆
That’s the way to make dreams yell because he never really yells.
Sapnap: 50 dollars for a glass of lemonade Everyone in the dream team: *screaming*
Wooooooooooooooow  He got the vbucks dou
I think they did an excellant job of building the neighborhood. Very nice upper scale community with palm trees. Their awesome builds really add to the atmosphere of the story.
Sapnap age reveal!!!
I would try it  well if it was good
Lol
50 DOLLARS???
"ONE GLASS FIFTY DOLLARS?"
I like how they all scream and i totally didn't have my volume up really high when they screamed
no one. Absolutely no one. Not even a cell during mitosis.        Dream every 5 seconds screaming INTENSELY into the mic: “50 DOLLARS!?!?!?!??!!,!??!!?!”
what ripoff/scam? it's a good deal.
Should've put 49.99
poor sapnap, if someone yelled at me like that i would be traumatized
I- father gog PFTTTTTT
We need more child sapnap We need more child sapnap We need more child sapnap
sapnap back at it again with his little kid voice <3
Don’t get me wrong I fking love this video but if George was the child and Dream was the dad-👀 I’m just saying-
My favorite part is when george says:''Son,you are disgusting!''
Litearly my paranets when i do somethink wrong like i does get my pen back on table but its in my school bag or somethink that little thinks AHALJAHLAJ
in every single dream short theres always gonna be someone yelling "DISGUSTING" also george such a great dad wow/

I feel Like the meaning of dream shorts is to make us laugh.
Lol
plot twist: he probably meant 50 cents
I thought this was gonna be a duck song parody, but this works too
😂😂😂
Do u think dream notices that he sells water bottles for 50$ on his merch store
george is such an epic dad
lowkey thought george was going to be like "what are u doing why aren't u selling it for 500"
i am laughing way way way harder then dream right now
S O N  Y O U A R E D I S G U S T I N G
This is the lemonade that Mr beast gets
50 DOLLARS ARE YOU SCAMMING PEOPLE SAPNAP?!?!?!?!??!
George future wife be like:OK I don't have to worry about my son😂😂😂😂
Dream shorts lore scares me
I love how sapnaps always the child🤣
wow. The child is a disappointment to humanity. Also, I see dream and George had a son.
Everyone: *screaming at the child ripping people off/sap nap   George: SON YOU ARE DISCUSSING
And thats the story of how Sapnap turned to arson and chaos
even 5 dollars is a lot lol
I love your shorts
50 dollars though I’d slap the kid but seriously that a goddamn rip off I’m loving these shorts
*FiFtY dOlLaRs????!!!!!*

Awww I feel so bad for Sapnap!!! 😭😭😭
SON YOU ARE DISCUSTING
poor kidnap
I’d buy $50 of Lemonade from Sapnap
I wonder how great of a dad Gogy is gonna be in the future.  Flashback: “Son you’re disgusting!”
I bet it a amazing lemonade
Google: How to take care of a son.  Be kind and teach them life lessons as they grow up.  Don’t yell at them for a mistake that they made.   Bing:
Dream thought the community wanted more child sapnap      He was correct
SonNap
The joke might have been stolen
lol
Lmao
It was .50 but he doesn’t know decimals 😂
Chill out guys, he meant 50 singaporean dollars
Video be like: while(true){ dialogue(50 dollars); Loudness++; }
Even $5 would be too much, $1 is good
50 Dollars?!!!!!!!
George is sapnaps daddy

It’s 100 years in the future where 50 dollars is worth 2 dollars
Lemon 🍋🍋🍋
They know what we want (child sapnap voice)
If dream comments on this comment I’ll give him 0 dollars
SAPNAPs voice acting is so cute
if he said it was 50 cents he would be rich...
imagine getting pinned by dream lol 😂
I say that this is a VERY good price.
George: "-Son you are *DISGUSTING*-" Me sitting here . . . : "George! Your such a great father!! "
It's that kid angain
rip
Good dad.
Poor Sapitus Napitus!
$50 for a glass of lemonade? THATS A STEAL!  I’ll take 2!
50 dollars for a glass of lemonade comically brings out a person-sized glass of lemonade
Sapnap just broke and need some money-
You should have had Tommy as the 12 year old.
Why do i feel bad about sapnap 🤣
When your dad betrays you
I’m surprised this didn’t have to do something with *piss*
Dream pls leave link for map your on for mcpe pls
Lol, dream and everyone is so funny
Guys, I think he meant 50 cents!
Gogy is such a good dad everyone should be like him 💞💞💞💞
He's trying to get enough money to nuke every country
I was hoping George said "50 dollars that's way to cheap"
He has coupons of 50% so it’s 5 dollars!
50$!$$!$!
Hi
Sapnap become way better at voice acting ngl
In 20 years... it will be very cheap!
I saw this and immediately thought “this better not be a piss joke”
I kinda feel bad for young sapnap😂
$50.....proper bargain mate
Y is seeing them mad funny
I hope youtubes say the same thing but not the 50 dollers part
Oh come on george, Sapnap would became a millionaire in no time
"THIS CHILD IS SCAMMING PEOPLE" wait does Dream mean tommy
That’s what the point of the mask is
Dream:*Screaming* Me:uh oh  Bad:*screaming too* Me:AHHHHHHHH George:son u are disgusting Me:Wha-WHAAAT okay okay this gone too far and my ears are broken
The reason it is 50 is because the “sugar” he bought was expensive.
Therapist: kid voiced crouching sapnap isn't real, he's only in your imagination *kid voiced crouching sapnap:*
LMAO

Dream: talks about how he will support this lemonade stand  Also Dream: *angry screaming*
Don't yell at the child you'll make him cry D:
Dream Team shouting "DISGUSTENG" in every shorts lives in my mind rent free
lol
I’m 12 and I feel offended lol
50 dollar is illegal, *20 dollar is legal.*
Snapnap: I...I just wanted to sell lemonade... Everyone: NOT FOR $50!
"SON you are DiSgUsTi—" -george to snapmap 2021
Kid sapnap :/
I like how there wasn’t even a twist at the end, they just bullied him for selling $50 per glass
FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE? WHAT IS IT? MADE OF GOLD??
Bro its just a child
Poor sapnap
They made this   AT NIGHT?!

Sapnap has a cute voice
THIS ONE WAS SO FUNNY I died xD
DISGUSTANG
0:48 “nooo It’s really good” 🥺

I thought Bad was going to be the dad not George hahaha
LMAOO
lmao
I Feel Like Antfrost should have walked up saying "50 Dollars? That's a Good Deal!"
wait a minute... why did thing actually go right this time, it's illegal.
It's not a Dream Short without the word disgusting
Legend has it that SapNap is still crying
Dream bought the Lemonate anyways
"SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING"
49.99
today we learned something.        *George is a horrible dad*
He should have sold it for 69 dollars
Who feels sad for sapnap im 12 and if this happened to me ill become a gamer for the rest of my life
Sapnap after all of them shouting: Alright new sale, *$100*
loool
Dream shouting sounds pog
I was dying laughing when dream started to yell

George is just like my dad, except for normal circumstances :(
Itna time hai to ek speed run video upload krna re bohot maza aata vo dekhne me

Son, you are disgusting!  Jesus Christ, didn't even try to step in to change to price to $5
Can we appreciate the building behind them
‘Son you are DISGUSTING!’ 1:32
Love hearing bbh get mad at young sapnap lol
The real crime is that lemonade stands don't sell grapes
A Dream walked up to a lemonade stand and he asked the kid, running the stand: ''hey, have you seen Gogy?''
IM WHEEZING🤣🤣🤣THIS IS THE FUNNIEST ONE YET OMLLL SLSJRKWGWJSN
Plot twist: it's limanade
Part me thought BBH was gonna be all like, “50 DOLLARS?! That’s a steal!!” And then proceed to buy like 20 glasses.  Edit: Oh cool, this comment has 800 likes. I guess it's time to sell out. Go subscribe to my channel if you want.
I wonder if the price was 5.0 USD but Sapnap didnt saw theres a dot between the 5 and 0  l o l
hes having a sale! it used to be 60!   inspired by pixelcraftian
“Son, you are disgusting” LMAO!
*FIFTY DOLLARS?!?!*
Dream irl: oh $50 is nothing
Plot twist: George meant that 50$ is very low price.
What if it was worth fifty dollars though
Someone is going to anima it
I would cry if Dream shouted at me like that
that's me whenever my dad corrects me about something
hi 12 nice to meet u
imagine god comes and just joins them
Twist sapnap meant 15 dollars 💵
Poor sapnap
ahh i thought bbh was gonna be like, "$50!... What an amazing deal!"
sapnap what a rip off
And he waddle a way (waddle,waddle)And he waddle away (waddle,waddle)
Count how many times they said 50 dollars
i like how they call a 20 years old man a child
then sapnap grew up to be a famous football player and now people beg for his lemonade🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️
Childnap returns
I loved at the end when George said: SON YOUR ARE DISGUSTING
this is so incredibly loud. especially dream.  that's all i had to say
George and bad switched roles, Bad just got tired of Sapnap killing the neighbors cat.
Dream, Bad and George at end : 50 DOLLARS YOU RIP OFFFFFF UEHSJSHENDUS
Alternative title: Bullying Sapnap
I think it's obvious by know when ever dream does a short he gets shorter just look at his profile
Child Sapnap is my new sleep paralysis demon
I just died-
Poor Sapnap :(
I love Dreams rage xD 0:40
ah yes, geoge is so nice to his son  "SON YOUR DISGUSTING"
It an amazing Stand  Jotaro be like :(

Why is sapnap always the kid in these shorts-
THE CUTOFF-

Reminds me of a tiktok- LOL
1:23 I saw george’s eyes
Comment for algorithm
Dream: $50!!!! George: Your disgusted Sapnap *inserts crying noises*
Why u bullying him
Oh this explains why people where yelling at my lemonade stand
my ears are dead. :X
I used to mix dollars and cents when i was a kid.
50 DOLLARS
Its time to ponder why dream shouts at the small boi when he has a Large Gold in his hand while asking for the cost in minecraft and also has a lot of money in real life.
Bunch of men screaming at a 12 year old
i have never ever heard somebody scream like that before and dreams scream is just sooo   i don't know what to say......😱
sapnaps voice is so cute its like bads lore voice lol
i love sanap's kid voice
George: *Son, you're disgusting!*  lmao!
1 like = 1prayer for sapnap
ngl thought bbh would be the dad considering the dreamsmp canon
when next manhunt with ranboo
Is it just me or do they end up screaming ever. single. video.
Dream has merch that's equally outrageous in price
I always wait for the punch line... and it never comes....
50 poo for lemon
Dream half of the video was just like: *T R I G G E R E D*
i thought it would be piss but this makes more sense
50 DOLLARS *spit flys everywhere
Is “disgusting” their new favorite word. maybe they’ll fit it into every single short in the future lol
Ur beatiful Face dream
took me months to finally find this channel hehe
sapnap reminds me of hedwig from split
Can i buy a glass for *50* dollars?
Dream Shorts Channel in a nutshell: *dream team Yelling*
Wait, if Bad is Dream's father And George is Sapnap's father. What Antfrost is of who?
1:28  George : Son you are disgusting.
that was a GREAT 1:34 minutes of life :D
Sapnap changed his voice to try sound 12 but in reality he already sounds 12
i think we all known how hard peer pressure is george...
Poor ShapNap...
Wow george that was harsh you didn't have to call him disgusting
Ha
wow y'all are so cheap you won't even pay $50 for some lemonade smh /j
I'm loving these shorts 😂
dreams skin is messed up
50 DOLLARS!!! WHAT!? 49 WILL BE OK BUT 50 IS TOO MUCH THES IS UNACCEPTBL 😠😠😠🤬🤬😠🤬😠
If you don't want to see DREAM upset, don't sell him lemonade for $ 5
When dream:
50 dollars? you mean 1 pound?
50 DOLLARS!?
XD
50 DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE?!?!?!  -Dream, BadBoyHalo, and GeorgeNotFound 2021
Why do I feel so bad for Sapnap in this-
the way dream got progressively louder and louder as the video went on 😀✋
Ok I am 13 this is not what 12 is😅😅😅
we all know bad couldn’t be sap’s dad for this because he couldn’t say “son you’re disgusting”
$50!?!?!??! WWWHHHHHHAAAAAATTTT!!?!?!?
Hahahah I laughed so hard after watching this
is it normal that the child has an american accent and yet the father is british
I expected Bad to say “What a steal!”
gergoe dad ark?!11?!!? :o
I was like wait 50 dollar what?!?! For just a glass of lemonade i would say 10 dollar for a glass of lemonade not 50 dollar!
it’s all part of the lore
I knew how this was going to go, yet I still laughed when it happened. That shows that they are great writers. While their acting isn't as good as Hermitcraft players, I think that just adds to the charm of the video, and the charm of themselves as well. I love your videos. Keep up the fantastic work.
Nothing like watching 3 grown men yell at another who’s acting as an 12 year old
Poor Sapnap... he just wanted to sell lemonade.
Ok I can't get over sapnaps child voice
Lol George said why r u shouting at it in minute 1:23
Don’t worry it’s 10 percent off
I saw one time someone selling lemonade for 150$
i love how they yell at him and george says nothing in defense XD
plot twist: george's son is numberblind
This was so anticlimactic, I love it. 😂
SON YOU ARE dIsGuAsTaNg >:[
"Son you are disgusting!" 😂
Foreskin is a RIP off
"Sapnap if dream buys a glass of lemonade"  Sapnap: "Business is Boomin"
SAPNAP IS SO CUTE LMAO
I see bad had diamond armour
$50!??
:(
why has sapnap been in his baby arc lately
I’ve had some of his lemonade it’s really good it’s worth it
And he said to the man, "50 DOLLARS!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"
Plot twist: the glasses were 5$ each and the only option is 10 glasses
Me: why does dream only post once a month?      Them:
Young Sapnap is trolling people once again... But surely Dream has gold, that's like 100k.
I still feel bad for the 12 year old
wgeb U furst thiyght t
Dream team + Bad shouting at children
I like how gogy said: son ur disgusting
George: UR DISKUSTING
I feel bad for sapnap
It’s almost iconic how whenever dream screams his mic quality pretty much expires for a split second.
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😤😤😤😤
For a sec I was like the lemonade was pee and the sugar sapnap and his dad went to get was coke
Why do I think they r going to say only 50?
"son you are disgusting" PLEASE IM DEAD XDDD
Dream ruined lifes
Sapnaps child voice sounds scary
The best one out of all of them
Oh nooooo XD
and then George gets the belt out.
the lemonades pee
I think the lemonade is 50$ guys.
Bruh,NOW SAPNAP ID THE SON OF GOGY??!!!! HUH
12 is how they all act hahaha
50 DOLLARS?
uhm... so uhh... I think I know the mom?    Wink Wink im proud of ya dream
I kept wating for the twist. 50 DOLLLARS?!? WHAT A BARGAIN

i think he doesent know his cents and dorllors calm down
3 grown men screaming at a grown man
Poor sapnap
I feel sad for sapnap but still 50 ARE U FUCKING SERIOUSLY
Kid Sapnap Is Love, Kid Sapnap Is Life!
i see we're getting our moneys worth of the sapnap child voice
George's emotions are the only real emotions here
Local green blob, leather cop, and colorblind dad shout at a kid about lemonade prices   Your typical tuesday in june
50$ the hell the hell
damn prince Philip died on tommy’s birthday :/
🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇
I was expecting a giant glass of lemonade
Dream does not like children huh? Explains the war with tommy..  Im joking btw
Are we sure its lemonade? wait whats lemonade-
$50 DOLLLARSSS .... holds pure gold bar XD
The currency Emerald 1$ Gold 5$ Redstone 10$ Iron 20$ Diamond 50$ Netherite 100$
when life give's you lemons you don't make lemonade you use them to make men angry
lmao
When sapnap is 19 and george is 23 = The FBI wants to get some lemonade...
He needs to listen to Luigi for some advice man.
LMAO
50 dollars? That’s a steal
I love how sapnap changes his voice  Unless its NOT sapnap *gasp*
Sapnap: Get some lemonade.    Dream:How much is it.    Sapnap:50$    Dream shouts:50$
GeorgeNotFound is known around the neighborhood for raising very ruthless businesschildren. they will stop at nothing to get money. they use their dad's colorblindness as a way to get around things.
I think Sapnap is trying to say 50 cents but he probably does not know the difference between dollars and cents.
I will sell it 69 $ 🤪
ngl at first i thought bad was going to be like FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ONE GLASS?!?! WHAT A GOOD DEAL!!
:]
Dream walked up to a lemonade stand...
Can i get lemonade i will pay 50$ ?? Pls!
karen mode
Calm down George your already taking his money, he’s just just trying to support the family
“This is my son, why are you shouting at IT!” 💀 Ya, I just realized he said “Him” ✋🏽 Yall don’t need to tell me again 💀
KarenWasTaken
For a second i thought bbh was gonna buy a lemonade..
Its look like lemonade tycoon wkwkwk
THIS IS QUALITY!! LMAO
After getting yelled ,sapnap will say okay I am sorry I will give a offer 49dollars for a glass of lemonade
*sapnap sells lemonade for 50 dollars each glass* *Dream, George, and BadBoyHalo*: Yells at sapnap
why has nobody mentioned that at 0:13 there are polished diorite bricks, same with the woods, this texture pack is amazing
I was expecting the lemonade to be pee
Isn't that gold ingot worth like 50k?
My fav line from George *“Son you are DISGUSTING”*
acab >:(       except for bbh
alt title: dream screams at a child
LMFAOOO WHY DID HE CALL HIM DISGUSTING-
YALL SO LOUD LMAOOO
Ésto me recuerda al inicio de un vídeo de Fred lammie
Lol omg hahahahahha
"Son you are disgusting!!!" Georgenotfound -2021
I am makin an animation for this
Poor sapnap :(
Me in awe that dream said "you mean 5?" I AINT AYIN 5 DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE that's expensive
Poor sapnap
Poor sapnap
Why does Dream hate children so much
50 dollars?! That’s a sale! Normally it’s 500 dollars.
To be fair, it was never specified how big said cups were, nor what the cups were made with. The cups could’ve been made with a little gold, or it could be a giant cup.....poor kid, trying to run a business and people yell at him.
And that’s how to traumatize a child!
I like dream
plot twist: sapnap trys to say 50 cents
When sapnap said: n-no  Like that was adorable 💀🤍
Honestly i would charge 100 dollars
When sapnap said: n-no  Like that was adorable 💀🤍
This is a really funny video to be honest
Maybe he is just saving up for a PS5
thats amazing that your 12
Poor Sapnap :(
Plot twist It's $0.50 but Sapnap is too young to understand decimals
If it’s George’s child then it’s also dream’s child /j
Guys! You should have asked him for grapes 🍇🤣
Dream, you have a GOLD bar
Almost every teenager has gained depression.   This is why:
HAHAHAHAHAH
Shouldn’t Bbh be the dad since it’s canon?? But George as a dad tho-
As a 12 year old I feel deeply disturbed they think we are that dumb at 6-7 grade.
He meant 50 ugandan dollars i don't think he was scamming someone arrested these dudes for screaming at a kid
I thought this would be a the duck lemonade stand parody but this didn't disappoint
Before Dream was a Youtuber, he was actually poor. He ripped people off to make some extra cash. This is where the idea came from.
Poor little Sapnap, that was actually sad
"SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING"
50  DOLLARS??!!!!
ok
kid sapnap: the sequel wait  *kidnap*
Petition for dream to scream in speed runs whenever he does something easy
lol
HahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahhahahahahahhahahhhahahhahahahahhaahahahahhahahahahahhahahaahhahahahahhahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHHHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHhhahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahaha
i wonder how much the lemonade is
Ah yes just another day what's next $1000 for a water bottle?
I have a feeling that this happened to dream in real life and so they made this
Wow
Son you are disgusting 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
it wouldve been funnier if tommy innit played as kids in these shorts
This was posted at 3 am
EA be like: not bad kid, not bad...
George: SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING   George son: turns around *
NANI HE WAS A STAND USER?!??!?!?!?
0:43 I mean it is freshly squeezed lemonade made from backyard lemons
What's lemon.
These give me the ability to get up and go to irl school every morning
"son you are disgusting!"
HEY DON'T YELL AT KIDNAP >:(
Normally I would make a scowl at a kid selling $50 lemonade, but if Kid Sapnap says it’s good then I have to buy one
I don't know why but dreams yell is always so funny to me
Note : bad has blue leather armor because he is portraying a cop
This is literally the first thing I woke up to
wow this just a story of people yelling at a kid who mixed up 50 dollars with 50 cents
"Son you are DISGUSTING!" - DadNotFound
Sapnap's kid voice is so cute 😩😩😩
I really thought that someone was gonna drink it and get superpowers
This reminds me of that Calvin and Hobbes comic where Calvin was trying to sell a lemon in water for 15 bucks a glass
50 dollars glass*  George: DISGUSTIN
Srsly how does sapnap make that voice
They should’ve bought it, it’s probably magical
POOR SAMPAM
Every sence then sapnap never sold anything ever again
George’s go to insult is “YOU ARE DISGUSTING” and I find it hilarious
Dream is a so kind person
Lets appreciate sapnap is george's son
XD
:so George would be the uncannon father of sapnap while bbh is cannonically his father for now :v
Awwwwwwwwwwww
FIFTY DOLLARS??? And I thought you were a cheapskate!
Everyone is just yelling while he hides in the corner 😭
How da hell this channel get 1M subs so quick. The 1st video in this channel is like uploaded 4 days ago?

LOL POOR KID
SAPNAPS BABY VOICE MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL WHYYY
Sapnap’s kid voice still scares me
bruhhhhhhhhhhh moment
Does anyone know this is notnico voicing sapnap
I could've bought some toilet paper with that.
It’s never a Dream short without someone saying “DISGUSTING” at the end
WHY IS KID SAPNAP SO FUNNY
george, bad, and dream: yelling at sapnap *me patiently waiting for one of them to say you should make it $100*
Just laughed my butt off
BUT WHAT IF ITS JUST THAT GOOD??? I bet they couldn’t find a Minecraft equivalent to lemonade
Bruh he’s 12 he doesn’t have concept of money.
i was thinking that george and badboyhalo would say its worth 500 as a joke but no i guess xD
please for the love of god just upload manhunts on your main channel
“Son you are disgusting!” Lol
Poor sapnap T^T
poor sapnap :p
"Kid sapnap ISN'T really he cant hurt you?" Kid sapnap at the lemonade stand :
i love kid sapnap i would risk my life for him i’m not kidding
Serves him right
I love how stupid these shorts are they always make my day xD
“SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING” I died then
Who in notch's name would sell items for prices like that? *AHEM* villagers
L E M O N A D E
I’m
Lmao George just put his son up for adoption lmaoooo......
I felt so bad when sapnap went to the corner to cry 😢
They don’t even leave, just stick around to gather a crowd to shout at this young 12 year old boy who is selling Lemonade for 50$ +TAX!!!!!
Poor Sapnap :(
i love how all of these shorts have no message at the end but feel like they should
Sapnap: I'm twelve Dream: THATS AMAZING
Technically the kid said a “glass” of lemonade but he never specified if it’s going to be the biggest glass of lemonade with 100 gallons of lemonade.
What if the glass is big? :<
D:
And then they beat him up
"son, you are discusting" sounds like my dad!
don't worry he'll make a discount $ 49
everyone stop spoiling the video in the comments you know I'm interested in the dream shorts lore so stop ://///
Oh deer now Sapnap build his fort to lemonade Stand
50 DOLLARS- WHAT WHERE YOU THINKING !?!?!?!!.!.
Poor Sapnap XD
is it $50?
Poor sap
I was expecting it to be wholesome- why did I expect that
lmao made me laugh a lot cuz of dream just yelling
50 dollars!!!! are you riping people off!!!!
These are so good I can't tell if there real or not
Do u mean 50c
Poor sapnap
What if it was really good lemonade
Plot twist this was sapnap's real voice and in other videos, he used voice changer
Imagine if they saw how muck Mr Beast spent on Ice Cream...
It’s 50$ because a glass is only about few kilo liters of lemonade.
:) hi I’m 12  Dream: ........ Hi 12 I’m Dream
I feel bad for him* (sorry its not my fault i dont have da-)
Tommyinit instead of sapnap
Dude I dont even care if its 50 atleast I have lemonade and meet SapNap
Plot twist: *He actually meant 50 cents but didn't know the difference*
50 DOLLARS??????
Poor sap nap
Millionaires be like: Only $50?
In the end sapnap's sad
Maybe it’s really good lemonade
George's son is Sapnap? This changes things a bit
Need More Kid-Nap  -Fluffy 87
LEMONADEEE

Why is Sapnap always a child in these videos
Poor sapnap he doesn't know numbers even as a 12 year old.
SAPNAPS KID VOICE ON POINT I LOVE THIS
Yes.  George is such a good dad.  Dream, could you please feature my YouTube channel BF Mediatainment?
Alternative title:  screaming at sapnap

he should make it two dollars not 50
“SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING” how does he know? Did he take a bite?
Please i cannot take another episode wirh sapnap child voice
Poor Sapnap. He just wanted to sell his lemonade 😔
When he said "50 dollars", i really felt that.
Lemonade for $50 that's a rip off he just give him people like adopt me scammer!
If you're here watching Dream and feeling inspired then keep going grinding away! We are all in the same boat here looking for ways to help all our channels. keep up the good work and Never Give Up!
$50 is not much in "Minecraft". Dream was paying with a Gold Ingot. A GOLD INGOT!
"SON YOU ARE DISCUSSTING" ~Dad
Poor babynap

This is the best one so far ngl
Imagine he thought five was fifty and he didn’t understand why fifty dollars was an unreasonable price 😂
well i do feel kinda bad for sapnap
"hey hey hey what are you yelling at a this child for?"  - Badboyhalo, 2021

Dream: That's Amazing!
My faivorite tv show

Bbh and sapnap when George doesn’t 1v1 dream after they die
Badboyhalo is Dream’s dad , George is Sapnap’s dad and George and Dream are getting married so Dream is Sapnap’s stepmother?
We need to give Sapnap an Oscar for his incredible acting.

He needed to sell it for 100
How bout $49.99?
That final 'You are *DISGUSTING* ' made my heart broke...

MrBeast: $50?

Plot twist: ZIMBABWE dollars
he posted the day of my bday im happy
Still  Sapnap and Dream have been multiplying  And still dream doesn’t know what sapnap said  And still Sapnap  is telling him “I said that what your mom said to me last night”
Why is Sapnap always a child
lol i cant get over dream's screaming
i had a dream that george was a part of the lore. he also had a really deep voice for no reason. it was very dramatic and i cried. not because of the lore, but because george didn’t sleep through everything again.
Congrats Everyone Who Come Early And Got This Comment💎❤❤.

Sapnap Actually I am not selling 50 dollars per glass I am making a good deal now. Ok? Hear me out. 1million dollars.  How does dat sound? Billionaire: oh can I buy the whole stand?
there’s no punch line. that’s it. they just traumatize this child, scarring him for the res of his life.
You know, you could always ask him if he can sell it at a lesser price! :D
50 dollar for lemonade.... WHAT..
Sapnap is good at being a 1st grader
XDDDD

Dream sounds a lot like Aaron from Aphmau's series in this vid.
Should’ve had tommyinnit play the kid in the lemonade stand, he wouldn’t even need to lie about his age.

The way they all just scream at him
I love how dream asked if hes wepping people off
They never knew why its 50 dollars. They should try it first xD
He took me to gett kool aid dust for my stand
If sapnap was making kool-aid i'd understand i charge like 50$ to plus i get tips :]
"50 Dollars!" He proceeds goes and hides in the corner.
Me wondering why Dream posted this at 2:00 am for me
George at the end:  “SON YOU ARE DISGUSTANG”
In the end, you will hear 'THIS IS DISGUSTING'
So you are disgusting 😂🤣
I say for 3.99 or 5.99 BUT NOT 50$
Sapnap: :(( BBH: 50 Dollars?! George: YOU ARE DISGUSTING Dream: See Ya

One gold bar is worth way more than 50 dollars
And all he wants to do is sell lemonade....

Jeez poor kid
Truly disgusting, that some people would do this horrible thing
When you are 12 and don’t sound like a 2 year old
this video is just grown men yelling at another person pretending to be 12 ah yes, child abuse
xddd
Laughed so hard here XD
Sapnap voice 😂😂😂
Sounds like chick-fil-a lemonade
I love how Dream is so passive at the beginning and then JUST SCREAMS at his mic
“SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING” XD
"Son, you are disgusting" 😂🤣💀
I love Dream's voice when he is angry, lol
Sapnap is younger than TommyInnit comfirmed!?
He meant 50 yen
0:09 hi 12
And the kid never sold lemonade again 😶
Y'all never let him tell you how large the glass was
Dream: This is amazing! How old are you? Sappity nappity: 12... Dream: GASS GASSSS GASSSS!
me who is not american and calculates $50 to pounds (UK) to see if it is reasonable in the UK.. £36.46 WHATTT THAT IS SO EXPENSIVEEEE WHAAAAAAT-
$50 for a glass of lemonade? I think the kid for got the decimal.   $5.0
NGL when George came and was like “FIFTY DOLLARZZZZ?!?!? SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING” I thought he was then gonna say something like “YOU SHOULD BE SELLING THESE FOR 100 DOLLARZZ INSTEAD OF 50” I thought he was gonna up the price XD  Edit: what are those orange blocks? Like the one under the flowerpot, I don’t think I’ve seen those b4
poor child geting yell at :(
So the point is...
Dream screaming makes it so funny
JUST BUY IT INSTEAD OF YELLING AT THE FREAKING SMALL FREAKING CHILD 😂😂😂😂
I think i love these short skits a bit more than his main channel cuz he uploads like once every year
i love helping the community im guessing he means I LOVE SHOUTING at the community.
poor sapnap...
At the end sapnap is just crying in the corner
Anyone obsessed with sapnaps kid voice? Like he sounds so cute and little . 🥺✋
$50 lemonade? id pay that just for kid sapnap
SONNNN YOUU ARE DISSSSSSSGUSTING
Sapnap is a good acter
Did Dream actually do a face reveal? Does he really use a voice changer?
At the end every hates the son
no actual is 100 dollars
"This child is scamming people" why did I instantly think of Tommyinnit
I thought he was gonna buy lemonade for a good price and its pee instead of lemonade
Daddy George
Dream: *walks off at the end* Me: *And he waddled away, waddle, waddle, waddle.*
Yes having a sale only 80 dollars !

Kid Sapnap is back
Every time another person came on screen, i was just waiting for him to say 'Fifty dollars!!?' 'That must be really good lemonade!'
The way how sapnap is a little kid in a fortress and then a president then a kid again :|
PLEASE I CAN'T WITH THE "YOU ARE DISGUSTANG"
I love how George says why are you yelling at my son but at the end he yells at him himself

The inastate in truely paved with memories of a past life I lived when I was the age of 18
*Kidnap* is back 👏
I was expecting BadBoyHalo to say: “*50 dollars?! That’s not nearly enough money!!!!*”
Poor sapnap all of them yelling at him
Dream walked up to the lemonade stand, and asked the kid running the stand Hey, how much for a glass?    I don't know how the actual song goes, and am terrible at rhyming so I gave up
I was so dead when George as sapnaps dad said,  50 DOLLARS FOR ONE GLASS, YOURE DISGUSTING!
POV: *All 12 Year Olds Including Me Have Been Offended*
"SON, U R DISGUSTING"
I am feeling bad for sapnap
I made a dream mask it’s a little to big but I think it’s cool🙂🎺🐛
Sapnap's child voice is so funny pls 😂✋🏻
1% off since jr yellint at me
Imagine having gold in ur hands that like 1000 Dollars irl while being mad at a kid who just wants to sell lemonade for fifty dollars
Why is George the dad though I thought bad was sapnaps dad..
I honestly thought BadBoyHalo was going to try one and then like it so much and pay 100 dollars for another one.
Pfv legenda em br

Sapnaps idea of a 12 year old is great😭
Why didn't you bring in Tommy for this act ? He was better being a kid
and that’s why my dad left to go get some lemonade it’s been 13 years now
Even Sapnap’s father called him a failure
Therapist: George’s eyes can’t hurt you George’s eyes: 1:21 - 1:22

Fun Fact: I had a dream as snapmap and got tortured by the SCP foundation, and then akumatized. then woke up.  I also woke up in the hospital after hanging out with dre and gogy.  and in some way shape or form it kept going from 1st person to third. needless to say, s n a p m a p ' s a m a i n c h a r a c t e r.
I thought dream was homeless, but he’s poor now too. It all adds up
Dream-Hi can i have a lemonade   guy thats selling lemonade-Yes its 50$ Dream-50$!!!!!! WHAT THAT IS A SCAM NO DO YOU MEAN 5$!!!!
If Ph1lza was his dad he'd craft a belt
B-Bisnesmen
dream likes shouting at kids huh
I have to wonder if Sapnap's character meant cents instead of dollars and didn't realize the miscommunication.
50 DOLLARS
$50!!!
*Promised Neverland theme*
Dream said he loves helping the community May I have a new graphics card sir
This literally is so sad
The way dream says “Oh my gosh!” Is hilarious to me
😂😂
This ist sso great dream
SON YOU ARE DISGUSTANGGGGGG
For a second I thought George was going to say *FIFTY DOLLARS?  MAKE IT 100!* lol
“That’s disgusting” 😂😂 best thing I’ve heard all day
Nice screams, I would like to hear them at 100% xD lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Sapnaps dad just made it worst i though  that he would helo lamo
Price: 50 dollars Me: I prefer a glass of water thanks
And that's how he bought the giant fort...
it is the same dream who orders steak from Japan
"*son, you are discusting*!!"

Bruh bbh could have just arrested sapnap 😅
*Kid-nap* is going to get *kidnapped* if he continues to sell the lemonade for $50.00
I'm really disappointed he didn't sell grapes.

Sapnap:im 12 Dream:ow thats great
FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE!?!?
Poor Sapnap, he only was just selling his backyard squeezed lemons   *For 50 dollars*
Lol
Quick cash grab dream, love it!
i know the background toook long to make
50 dollars!?
So George is Sapnap’s dad and Sapnap is basically Dream’s mom from the wed thing... Damn
"son, you are disguting" my dad in a nutshell
Cut Edit: 50 DOLLARS JUST FOR 1 LEMONADE JUICE!?? THATS SO CHEAP!!!!!
I thought the cop was gonna say that's a steal!
When dream rages his voice is just too good 😂
KID SAPNAP IS SO FUNNY
Sampam is POG at being a child (it’s edited because i said child and it autocorrected to cult-
Haha i just like who they scam at sansap. for 50$
Rip sap
The back of my mind thought he was gonna ask for some grapes
Now sell 2 glasses for 100 dollars
Sapnap: *george’s son* George: *sapnap’s dad* Dream: *EXCUSE ME WHY 50 dollars?!* Badboyhalo: *wHat?- 50 dollars-*
I love kid sapnap. And also Dream screaming stuff is halarious
H I s  b a c k y a r d
XD
When life gives you lemons, you become a capitalist.
Mom: The Internet Is A Dangerous Place  The Internet:
when life gives you lemons you make $50
50$? No one's gonna pay that much
Why
Dream: "How old are you" Sapnap: "Twelve" Dream: *Proceeds to scream at a twelve year old at how outrageous their prices are*
Dream : Rager BadBoyHalo : Rager 2.0 George : Son betrayer, also Rager 3.0 Sapnap : just a lil kid who doesn't know what 50 dollars is
its dream smp lore, but not dream smp lore
THATS 2,429.58 FOR US LMAO
yea lets all team on sapnap
In all honesty  *I would still pay for it*
Plot twist: it was fifty dollars for the whole stand
I want 10 minutes of this.
what did i just watch?
And thats how i met your father...
And dream waddled away waddle waddle till the very next day
When I heard he was 12 my jaw dropped, I thought he would say like 7. 12 YEAR OLDS DONT SOUND LIKE THIS. 😂
I’d probably act the same way if some kid offered me lemonade for 50 dollars
Now I know what dream does in his free time
I can buy lemonade from sapnap 🥺✋
I LOVE THIS DIAKWKAKA
SAPNAPS VOICE KILLS ME
Love it!
50 DOLLARS?!?!?!?
*FOR 50 DOLLARS!!!!???*
F in the chat for Sapnap
This is the best lol
SoN yOu aRe diSguStIng....
I'm guessing this is how sapsap sound when he was younger and had a high pitch voice lol
You should've put Tommy instead of Sapnap, he could've played a child better.
Sapnap is so cute
ur just giving stans the idea that dream and george created sapnap coz sapnap is georges kid
jeez, sapnap got the work
SO if thats Georges son Is that Dreams son as well?
idk why but this is so funny
Sapnap : I'm 12 Me : *Same here* Edit : *e*
I literally thought someone was going to buy it and say that dream was cheap  Also I love the “your disgusting” at the end
sap nap gets bully again
Instructions Clear: Don’t sell a glass of lemonade for 50$
I'll treat my kids like how george treats them.... ;]
bruh
Wait is he talking about hims-
SapNap as a child is more cute than SapNap himself
I like how adorable Sapnap being a kid. Even the animated version is good. Man i want more Sapnap kid
"SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING"
Plot twist: **His lemonade’s quality is really worth 50 dollars**
Do you take tooth
Keeping up with the kardashians more like keeping up with the dream team.
We need more Kid-Nap
Fun fact: fun facts aren't fun
I love Sapnap’s dumb kid voice 💀
kid sappy nappy reminds me of my little sis
George : You are *DISGUSTHANG*
Dream:50 DOLLARS??!! Sapnap's roleplay dad(Goerge):its 5 dollars:/
Poor kid lol
I do believe Sapnap would do that tho XD
Baby Sapnap isn’t real, he can’t hurt you..... OH MY WORD
FIFTY DOLLARS
Claim your ticket of: early but have nothing good to comment
50₱ no way
*sun you are* DiSgUsTiNg *!*
I was expecting George to say "son i told you that the price is $100"
I don’t think 50 dollars exist, Maybe selling 15 dollars for lemonade
When life gives you lemons you need to make a lemonade and sell it 50$
Why does Sapnap sound like that? 😭
I like how dream screams😂
George at the end thou
When they post this at 3am Central
I realized it was pee early Well it probably was
what if it isn't lemonade 😳
so good
LOL
I love it he starts with dadedadeda
The price boutta make bad swear
so we know now, that Sapnap sells a glass of Lemonade for "50 DoLLaRS"
how bout 49,99?
DISGUSTENG!
THE LAST PART LMAOAAOAOAOAOAOAOA
$50 that's impossible
Me: Poor kid-nap he's just trying to sell lemonade...  5 seconds later  Me: WAIT 50 DOLLARS!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME I don't have that kinda money but I do have a lot of pokemon cards 😂
12 YEAR OLDS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THAT
Thought they were gonna agree with the kid Saying it’s cheep
Poor sapnap

A dream walked up to a lemonade stand and said to the sapnap running the stand, hey what does it cost?
AYO STOP BULLYING HIM HE MEANT 50 MONOPOLY DOLLARS WHAT ELSE
New title - Adults shouting at some random boi

Capitalism in a nutshell
I thought this would be a totally different story
poor sapnap getting bullied :(
iam gonna grab a popcorn brb for a sec
Woah the yelling was so sudden-
Son you are discussing
I liked how George (dad) isn’t on the sons side (sapnap)
So....HE GREW LEMONS IN HIS BACKYARD
Karen Dream ark? Karen badboyhalo ark?
Pfffff
SoN uR dIsCoOsTiNg
Plot Twist: George called Sapnap disgusting because he knew that it wasn't lemonade and it was just Sapnap's pee.
*highway robbery*
In Zimbabwe that would be really cheap
F
Lmao rip sapnap’s business he’s just hiding in the corner now
Plot twist: kid sapnap read the sign for the lemonade stand incorrectly and thought it was 50$ instead of 5$
50 >:/
I hope SAPNAP takes 50 orphans.
I can’t get over Sapnap voice 🤣
"YOU ARE DISGUSTING"  -GeorgeNotFound
pls upload on mainchannel
Poor sapnap
" _oh my gosh! this is an amazing stand_ "  to  " *FIFTY DOLLARS??!?!?* "😂
You should have had Tommyinnit be the child because he is one
The entire Dream SMP is yelling at him 2 hours later.
Sadnap
Heres another way to say lemonade  P I S S
I feel bad for sapnap look at him crying but, $50 ok
D E S T R O Y  T H E  C H I L D
can we please check and make sure that its lemonade?
Ummm.... Why is dream yelling at his son?
This was posted at 5 4 am
I wonder what happens next
If it was 50$ was it really lemonade? the price would make much more sense if it was something else..
I love this channel 🤗🤗🤗
And this is the second sighting of kidnap
*green blob tries to drink lemonade from a 12 year old scammer*
You should be happy. He's probably discounting you. Imagine his main price...
My only question is... is blond George real??????
What was BBH supposed to be?
This made my day day after I got bad news one of my grandmothers cousins died and lost $25
Me when bullied : *calls dad* Sapnap : wait... That's illegal
Damn, dream screaming at kids? not surprised. 😔 (I'm joking! i love you dream!)
Just at the end "SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING" lol
LMAO
Guess people really liked Sapnap's kid role. Almost called him "Kidnap," but... doesn't quite work 😆
This is my favorite yturs sapkid dream not found
Sapnap has turned into EA comfirmed
For dream that's 1 dollar he more than a millon per year so that's just pocket change for him
I’d like to think that this was the same kid who guarded the fort
sapnap and dream is cute
1:26 did George slap Sapnap         That's animal abuse
I would have loved if he was like “HEY ITS YOU AGAIN KID, THE ONE FROM THE FORT”
not gonna lie this is my favorite because they bully a child
George's Sapnap dad canon
So dreams father is badboyhalo and sapnap father is george?
Sapnap wasn’t wrong when he said he was 12...

So That’s what happens when you’re used to trading gold for ended pearls
Poor Sapnap, just making some money
i think it was a pee...
Damn Dream acting and raising his voice: so amazing and Kreygasm masterclass acting!
The lemons contain pure gold, he was gonna give them gold bars
why is dream making this videos, and not making videos on his main channel :(
o
I died laughing 😂😂😂😂
*50 Dollars*
Hmmm.... You made me remember that my brother is 13 years old
Dream when happy: loud talking* Dream when he mad: yelling and shouting*  Dream when he doesn't get his lemonade: *Demonic screeching*
50 dollars monopoly money, ez
50 DOLLARS FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE
Dream is very good with kids
then he waddled away  waddle waddle
It should be 25 cents per cup not 50 dollars like wtf
Since when George have a son
Ok this is werd.. so if gogy is the dad... Does that mean dreem is the mom?
Was there a joke in here?
LMAOOO
The Dream walked up to the lemonade stand and he said to the man, running the stand:  “OH SAPNAP!!”
I feel bad for snapnap he is nice but he doesn’t know how much stuff can be bought with 50 dollars
why does Sapnap always play the kid? xD
why did sapnap say his real age?
bruh $50???
Never fail to make me laugh
Lol
50 DOLLARS !!!!
50 DOLLARS??? WHAT ARE YOU  DOING?!?!
I want a tutorial for those backround houses
The high voice are my favourite thing
What of it was actually worth the fifty dollars because of how good it is
All 12 year olds feeling offended by the voice acting- (Including me)
"SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING" xD
Dream are you danny😧😱😱
Future Businessman right there. And ppl will buy, cause he'll have learned to run the competition out
George: “Are you Winning son?”  Sapnap:  ‘Crouches and turns in depression ‘
Sooo there is obviously some backstory behind this. What did sapnap do this time
Why is sapnap always a child
Me: sees sapnap is the lemonade stand owner. Also me: uh oh
The way sapnap just looked at the corner at the end 🤣🤣
Lol Sapnap's voice is so funny 😂
ooof
Moment of silence for the people wearing headphones
I love how they made an entire street with so much attention to detail for a 94 second video
"it's really good trust me :D"
Danny Gonzalez, really didn’t want to pay 50 Doll Hairs
SapNap=Child

I'm just imagine sapnaps face when he make that voice, so cute.
When he Said disgusting  I felt that
On god memories
Lmao. Imagine being called disgusting by one of ur parents
So this is basically what's happening in this video...  Sapnap: Trying to sell lemonade for $50 not knowing what he's doing    Dream: Getting too mad over the price of lemonade instead of walking away      Bad: Tries to knock some sense into Sapnap     George:" SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING"
ill accept
This is so hilarious and stupid at the same time😂
Tbh I expected BBH to say that’s a bargain.
Why is sapnap always the child 😭
He must've thought capitalism is about making things more expensive     Also if he labeled it as natural lemonade the hipsters would buy 5
Kid sapnap
your being rude
I just love how Dream says " *FIFTY DOLLARSSSSSSZ!?* " holding a gold bar    edit: pal i wrote wrong lmfao I dont even noticed
im 12 and let me tell u, i do NOT sound like that :)
More like 50©
Hi Dream Shorts fans!! If you don't know block facts, please subcribe to him, just search Block Facts
This is so funny the hecking hell

Plot twist: sapnap is just a 12 year old boy
It's  my birthday today
poor kid sapnap, he probably don't know how to count
George commits child abuse off camera
Sapnap's childish voice is adorable.
Once i saw lemonade i immediately thought it's not lemonade
the child should’ve been tommy
THAT LEMONADE COST AN LEG AND A ARM
Insted of sapnap it should have been tommyinnit
So they weren't lying about the mom jokes..
RIP headphone users but that was such an amazing short!
PLS SAPNAP WOULD DO THIS
there's a family tree now??? this is too much lore to handle
No :( -sapnap
"Why did you not sing lemonade song?!" -Hater
Hello DREAM😁💚
is this lore ?
This made me laugh more than it should’ve
George: Son You Are Disgusting!!!  that line killed me 🤣
Poor sap sapnap all he wanted was to sell lemonade😢😢😢
Wow sapnap voice is cute

Other Title: 12 year old learns capitalism from angry green teletubby.
Where are the grapes
I was watching and thought. Aww wholesome. Then towards the end. Oh no XD
Life is short . And what better way to spend your life watching DreamShorts
I thought George would come up and say “WHAT? You need to charge more!”
Poor sampam
I dont know why but this video right here is the one video that actually makes sense in this channel...
But like 5p dollars a goddam glass l freaking lemonase is actually insane
Why does sapnap always play the kid
he said 15 dolars, r u deaf?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I just can't get serious with high pitched Sapnap.It's so damn funny. I need Bad Cop now too.
*50 doLLARs!?*
Plot twist: he doesn't know the difference between dollars and cents
watching Dream Shorts is the best start to my morning
“DISGUSTANG”😂
Poor sapnap😪💅
smh, I bet that lemonade WAS worth fifty dollars.
l0l
I was expecting a duck song thing, this is better
:people like 50 DOLLARS WTH YOU SUCK F YOU  :kid like WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why is screaming at a child the funniest thing to me
"You are disgusting"        Poor kid, his own dad told him hes disgusting XD
George be like “SON YOUR DISGUSTING”
*dream scripting* I feel like its lacking something oh yeah one more time FIFTY DOLLARS XD
Poor sapnap but bad boy halo be like OH MY GOD THIS A RIPPOFF IDC IF IM MEAN RN BC U SCAMMM	sapnaps mimd: well I’m just a kid so how do I know it’s a ripppff
Lemonade:  special sugar Sugar Lemon
What this world needs is the Dream Team and the Bread Boys to do a video together
Yo the way george jumps in
For a second I thought Bad was gonna yell and then buy 3 glasses
Hmmm
I love how sapnap uselly play the child (he also got a good child-like voice for the role)
I’m surprised bbh didn’t pull out a gun on sapnap for that
A LITTLE DUCK ONCE WENT TO A LEMONADE STAND
Dream doesn't actually need to pay him in cash because he owes acquatince to a pleasure of great interest. Remember what he was about to with Bad in exchange for the pizza?  I am sure Sapnap would cooperate.
Son You're Disgusting.                     -GeorgeNotFound 2021
Why is he posting at f'ing 3am
Sapnaps soooooop good at talking in a kid voice

Part 2
“Son, you are disgusting!!!”  -GeorgeNotFound 2021
I thought he was gonna ask for some grapes.
Nice one 🤣🤣🤣
Son u are disgusting
This channel is just a way for the dream team to yell at each other XD
i was expecting something to happen but they just bullied him for a minute straight
Sapnap suffered a lot today, F
Poor sapy napy😂👏
I love how sapnap is always the kid
Fish 🐟
Diorite bricks??
"Son You Are Disgusting"
I like how dreams second reaction to the price is to scream at the child, not try to barter, but scream.
wow three hundred thousand viewers in 3 hours
I woke up sucking on a lemon
LOL I feel so bad for his child :( dude he's just  a kid man shill   wait 50 DOLLARS FOR A GLASSE OF LEMONAD WHAT THE FUDJE FÏOOMIHIL%ZELIHTGËJZ%LEJ
I feel like they'll take some of these shorts lore wise
I want an alternate ending where BBH actually buys it and gets the ability to fly, so Dream wants to buy it but it's out of stock.
"SON, YOU ARE DISGUSTING"  pardon?-
You didnt let him finish, the lemonade says supreme on it
Dream: likes to help out the community and asks to buy lemonade Sapnap: it’s 50 dollars  Dream: *Screaming intensified*
Sapnap: “Alright, that’ll be $50”  Me: “Do you accept card?”
Reactions are epic !!! Lol
FIFTY DOLLARS!!!! hahahaha
tbh 5 dollars for lemonade is also a scam
my daily serotonin boost! thanks dream team
sapnapp is so cuteee even though he's ripping people off
This wouldve been better if george would have said " 50 dollars! That lemonade is worth so much more you dum kid" 😂
EY, IM 12 TOO MATE
I mean im gonna still buy  even tho its 50$
i wonder how much the lemonade is
lmfaooooo everyons just bullying the 12 yr old even his own dad hahhaha
The glass should have turned out to be GINORMUS
Sapnap is basically EA Games.
“Im sorry, i only have a bar of gold, 50 dollars is too much”
poor sapnap :(
Poor sampam :(
I wonder how, I wonder why Yesterday you told me 'bout the Blue, blue sky And all that I can see Is just a yellow lemon tree
Poor Sapnap
the mike cut out-
"SON, YOU ARE DISGUSTING" i found that so hilarious until i realised the son was crouching in the corner of the van facing the wall 😭🖐
love the whole thing but it's a bit harsh at the end when he says his son is disgusting
Sapnap: I’m 12 Dream: *12, PERFECT*
Uhm so sapnaps life was that he had a lemonade stand, made a fort, and then somehow became president. Dang imagine having that life. But then again he kept getting yelled at. Probably got kicked out by George, uhm. Life is complicated for him.
Before Sapnap was a prime Minister Now a lemonade
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Lemonade I need to make video about lemonade XD lol
man dream is so funny the dream team they are just to good i don't know how they do this but its crazy
50 dollors for one glass of lemonade?!      Poor Sapnap T>T
Hello skedadudlers
Dream, u should do behind the scenes too
Dream's yelling voice ia SO HILARIOUS and I DONT KNOW WHY
*based on true events*

It's 50$ Because he is Sapnap

50 DOLLAR 😂😂
This is what happened if you wear headphones😅
We need more child Sapnap content please his cute voice makes my life better💖
Sad Young Sapnap
Bad trying to scream is hilarious
Let’s be real, if you’re 12 you’d have enough brain to sell lemonade at a reasonable price.  That’s the reason why they shouted at him. His own dad betrayed him, BBH a child friendly man, gone insane. Dream, well he’s Dream.
Ngl, I wish I heard a 12 year old with that voice irl.
"Son, you are *DISGUSTING* "
Sapnaps voice 😂
you should do a speed dating one lol
sapnap: 50 dollars :D dream: mad blob noises badboyhalo: mad devil noises georgenotfound: normal goergenotfound noises sapnap: ^cries in corner^

Polished diorite bricks: exists Me: the what
James Charles: "well, how old are you?" random guy on tiktok: "am 12" James Charles: "12, thats amazing, thats amazing"

These are so much fun
Should’ve made Tommy the 12 year old-

Sapnap, Gogy is actually your father? JK, I know it's just a joke
if this lemonade costs 50 dollars it must be the best lemonade in the unvierse
Offensive  bc 12 year old's don't sound like that
Sapnap's voice are cute

I fell bad for sapnap
Everyone gangsta on him until he does it to 100 dollers 🤣🤣🤣
I see no problem here
0:36 I think this kid has to be from the Philippines for them to think that 50$ isn't that much. Because here in the Philippines 50 of our currency is just 1$
I like at the  end george say : SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING 😂 it so funny
U guys went too far
Sapnaps voice is cute
LMAO THAT CUT OFF OF GEORGE SAYING "*SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING*"
Huh so that's the reason Sapnap didn't allow Dream in his fort.

money inflation in a nutshell
Sapnap is George's son😂😂😂
Awww i actually felt bad lol
im 10 and i have never done a lemonade stand
It was funny 2 hours ago
I love these vids
I expected badboyhalo to say "thats a steal!" and buy it
These minecrafters are better than award winning actors. They should win oscars
Poor sappy
I don't know, but I guess you upload these videos abaut midnight? 'Cause in my country it's 12 PM and it was uploaded one hour ago...    Also I have a wish for a hunter in manhunt: BastiGHG.  He isn't american but a good speedrunner and anyway almost that great like you in minecraft. He is one of the best HungerGamers on the whole world.
This was the best 1 so far
Poor sapnap he is getting shouted cus of 50$ it might be magic or maybe it might be that you get superpowers
Its a fair price    Because lemonade doesn't exist in minecraft
Fifty dollars???
WHERE GRAPES

What?A stand user?
Thats such a tommy thing to do
Dream team****shout
i'd be mad at him for yelling at sapnap but he sang for like 2 seconds in the beginning so he's forgiven /j
lol
Dream screaming is hilarious
“SON, YOU ARE DISGUSTING”   That was the most beautiful line ever
hello man hunt dream
George's skin would fit better for the kid
Dream I don’t know if I’m allowed to say this but Sanap just give you a damn lemon
Equivalent title: Dreamwastaken, Badboyhalo, and Georgenotfound yelling at Sapnap because of overpriced lemonade.
Sapnap got what he deserved
Dream: im gonna Burn your stand with lemonade 🍋
deluxe lemonade
Imagine the kid confused dollars with cents.
When life give you lemons..You call them Golden Oranges and sell them twice the price :) - *Grunkle Stan*
50 DOLLARS!?!?
Anyone else just waiting for Sin3e12 to post the animated version of this?
Uuu
I think it was supposed to be 50 cents but Sapnap being 12 years old, he didn't know what the c meant and thought it was 50 dollars.
Sapnap:50$   MrBeast: na *500$*
When life gives you lemons, give them back
it will be nice if every place in this mc shorts will be toured someday

I honestly thought this would be a Dream Team version of "A duck walked up to the lemonade stand"
I thought dream was a simp 😓
Baby nap.            I'm late lol
Every kid on his first day selling lemonade:

Poor little sapnap when live gives you lemons you take a lemons back
“SON, YOU ARE DISGUSTING.” - GeorgeNotFound 2021

Poor sapnap, BUT 50$ FOR *ONE* GLASS
50 DOLLARS??? ARE YPU TRYING TO SCAM PEOPLE??
More -KidNap- SapKid please
The thing is I feel like this is genuinely how Dream would react if he saw a 12 year old running a lemonade stand with $50 glasses 😂😍
The "IT'S DISGUSTING!" at the end 🤣
50?! Dollars?!?!   Just for one cup of lemonade!!! Unacceptable  Thats why no one is buying
50$... 50$,,? 50$.!? 50$!?! 50$!??!!??!!??!???!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? WHAT LEMONADE IS THIS
"son you are disgusting"            -Not Found, George

Mr. Beast: I will take 100M of that lemonade
I thought george was about to fight dream but they gang up to shout a sapnap lmao
People looking at dream's merch: 0:33
I wonder how much he is selling it for
Sapnap: 50 dollars lemonade  Dream:  Disgusting
If my channel was lemonade stand I would want everyone to but from me
blue badboyhalo is everything i need in life
Bad and sapnap sound the same lol
Once again sapnap goes overboard
i dont know guys  i think dream hates kids that sells lemonade
Now I saw dream and bbh's bad side :')
Sapnap’s child voice gives me so much life, he gave me light to heaven
Ah, lemonade , fresh squeezes , lemmoonnnaaaadde !!! Sapnap ..😶😶😆👌
I thought his father would support him😂
I love how supportive they are
Now we learned to never sell lemonade for 50$ or the world is going to end
1 day ago Sapnap: WE ARE GOING TO NUKE EVERY COUNTRY WE CAN!!!! Now:50$ for lemonade.
Awwww its kinda sad that there bullying babynapsap
Best dad ever
Omg things From adopt me first imagination box now lemonade stand 😱😱😱😱 what's next a magic door?
Where is my lemon ? I WANT MY LEMON !
C’mon guys he is just a kid be nice
Is dream really Danny
Usually 12 years old kids dosent sounds like that
Next short: either Minecraft Godzilla vs King Kong or Minecraft Rap Battle
Sapnap is 12.😂
Its basically my life ppl shouting at me for making money...
Omg yes
Somehow I was expecting Bad to say:It's totally normal!
1:33 George when he realizes his son is scamming people: “Son, you are disgusting”  Legit
My ear oh God dream
The acting is cringey but its less cringey when dream screams through that mysterious mic of his..
Top ten moments when the protagonist says it will be a nice day
Every one of these videos makes your day slightly better
im surprising george also in here because i thought this is in florida
Lolol
Wait wdym Sapnap's $50 lemonade isn't normal? I don't understand-
we ain't gon get over sapnap's voice
"Lemons fresh picked from my backyard" - Sapnap 12 yrs old  "50$" for lemonade not bad
sapnap using his kid voice haunts me
im 12 too
"son you are disgusting" i feel that
I LOVE KID SAPNAP LOL SO FUNNY
poor sapnap
LOL why 50$
:)
Alternate title: Sapnap gets bullied for trying to be rich
P.S Dream becomes Karen
Ya di da di da it's such a nice day in the neighborhood 😂😂😂😂
Well 10 or 12 dollars could've been nice :l
poor child
So it was sapnap who made Mrbeast 70,000$ Pizza
Why did I get a ad called dickies life
Nice
Don't yell at a child, he can do whatever he wants and sell lemonade for whatever price he wants
Am I the only one that hoped for the duck song?
When dream offers you *50 Dollars* To live
Fan Fuct: If your son is like 10 year old and make lemonade stand  and somehow he learned that fifty is 15 and fifteen is 50
If it was 50 pesos it woyld be alright to me
ok ...
This has gotta be the most aggressive scolding I’ve seen
Plot twist :mr.beast comes and buys lemonade glass for everyone and after drinking it tasted so good that evryone came every day to buy it.
Dream has started shouting more often hehe nice vid though
Inflation:
Paying 50 dollars for a glass of lemonade in minecraft = unfair Paying stacks of gold ingot to get pearl from pilgins only with 2.18% chance = logical
I mean it could of been really good lemonade
50 dollars!!! I would drink it for myself if I was him
OH MAN I WOULD LOVE THE ANIMATION OF THIS VIDEO
Ok let's talk abt sapnap voice... It's cute goshhh
Poor child
50 DOLLARS?
And the moral is.... don’t be stoopy
Lemonades are for only 90k dollars! He's right! Why is he selling it so cheap! XD
This is the best dream short
Sapnap always sounds like a kid in shorts 😉
Đrēam
Sapnap: Only 50 dollars!!! Dream: 50 dollars??!! For a glass of lemonade?!!!!!, That's outrageous Also Dream: casually holds a gold ingot which cost about $2000 in America
Dream did face vidijo į tinkh mugo lie
Me thinking george,dream and badboyhalo yelling at a 12 year old sapnap -_-
Alt title:Sapnao being yelled at for 1 minute and 40 seconds.
Sapnap went child mode again
I could buy more merch with those 50 dollars instead of lemonade
I must say it was epic xd
Yum Lemonade
XD
lol sapnap has been a kid again
Poor Sapnap😟 he's just a child🤫
_OMG_
Is it just me or does sapnap and dream’s relationship in the dream shorts channel is just like Kreekcraft and timmeh’s relationship on the kreeky channel
little do they know sap’s lemonades is the secret to eternal life
I didn’t even recognize sapnaps voice at first goodbye
Poor sapnap

"SON, YOU ARE DISGUSTING!!!!!" ~GeorgeNotFound
worst sentence your dad can say to you "SON YOU'RE DISGUSTING"
I was expecting “but dad, it has your “special sugar” in it”

That’s why we don’t sell lemonade more than a dollar

My honest response,  wtf
Only this was left to be seen : Gogy being Sapnap’s dad and calling him disgusting Edit : HOLLYYYY I HAVENT RECEIVED THESE MANY LIKES!!!!!
Son u are discussing LOL
Imagine if there's just a giant glass of lemonade behind the stand so it ain't a scam
Ngl i was expecting bad to say, “$50?!! THATS A STEAL GET ME ONE GLASS RIGHT NOW.”
He might have ment 50 cents
"Son, you are disscusting !" 😭🤣🤣🤣
Why is no one questioning the blocks the stand is made of?

Plot twist: It was only 50 cents just the child didn't know the monetary system.
0:49 utterly ridiculous

I thought it would ended with sapnap showing the glass of lemonade is actually in a giant size
Ah, childhood memories
Imagine he sold potions
"Son, you're disgusting"
Fun Fact: this is the longest Dream short video.

i honestly felt bad when sapnap went into a corner while crouching facing the wall while they were screaming at him
You do know that for 50 dollars you can buy 12.4385909 yoda lego star wars mini figures with light saber included
This should be called: 3 people cyberbullying a child
*L e m o n a d e*
The "SON YOU ARE DISGUSTING" just sends me all the way to my grave 💀🙌
The poor child
Son You Are Disgusting Hit me in the torso  I tried to hold it in XD
i mean it could be really nice and worth the price but....                  i guess we'll never know
poor sapnap
Imagine that the $50 lemonade was substituted with his maths results (B+). Then imagine that Dream, Bad and George were his parents. Now Sapnap is experiencing the life of literally every Asian child.
George is a great dad!!!🤣

Is Sapnap Changing his voice by his own or using a voicechanger? i think on his own but not sure
At this point I am genuinely interested what do they think while making the script for these videos
It so sad when sapnap get scold by his father (george)  😂

George: sOn U r DiSgUsTiNg
Sad 12 years kids get scream by three older people like he is hated but he is
George: "son, you are disgusting"  THE BEST DAD EVER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
Dream should stop making these short videos imo

why does sapnap sound like that.
I find it funny that a little girl in my neighborhood had a lemonade stand today haha
*Bad, George, Dream yelling at Sapnap*  Sapnap: cries in the corner quietly
i thought bad would say "50 DOLLARS... WHAT A STEAL" ngl
Sapnap just went through puberty when he said “No”
I bet Dream's gold bar is so much more than $50
😂😂
I really thought that Bad would be against Dream and would taste the lemonade and find it amazing
when life gives u lemons am i right
*sOn yOu ArE diSgUStInG*
There's no punchline, they're just yelling at George, this is fucking hilarious

How much do you want?  *50* dollars  Did you mean 5....?
Poor kid
Karen Dream LoL
Dreams march be like (Sorry dream) it's just a joke
Dream and Bad screaming at the same time shakes my brain, they need a glass of lemonade to calm down
Ah yes the bullying of a Child. Top comedy
When life gives you lemons make lemonade and scam people
George is such an amazing father figure, very.
e
why the hell does dream post so late is my question
Plot Twist: It was actually 50 cents.
Lol idk why but this reminds me of “Death Buy Lemonade” the animation from like 9 years ago
Please all I ask is for a sleeping beauty parody
Poor 12 year old sapnap
Lemonade stand for Kids
I’m being sooOoo early rn
I AM HERE in the 1st hour Lets gooo  When life gives u lemons........
Lemonade: costs $50 Mr. Beast: time for another video
I was expecting bad to say that 50$ was really cheap lmao
no one: sapnap: *trying to sound cute* ı'm 12
No, im late 37 mins😢
Why are you doing so many shorts
alternate title: why you should sell lemonade for 100 dollars instead of 50
Can I have some fresh squeezed lemonade kid
I was really hoping that bbh is going to be the father :)
Villager/Wandering trader and players be like:
I'm kinda desperate fr a video on the main channel ...
Its 1AM
Note: Don't watch this with earphone , headset or an earpods  with full volume   You will regret it,trust me
Early

“Son you are disgusting!” - GeorgeNotFound - 2021
50 DOLLERS WHATTTTTTT .....
Everyone Says "Never Give UP!!" But Noone Comes For Support:(
"You are disgustin-"
Poor SapNap he only wanted to get enough money to buy a Nintendo switch
50 dolars me: probaly a good offer B)
After they all yell at sapnap que the "And then he waddled away, waddle waddle waddle".
If only the lemonade stand had grapes
50 dolalalalal
I just watched a green man and two mens shouting  50 DoLlArS $$
sapnap: its good  it only 50 dollars dream: 50 DOLLARS  BBH: whats going on over here dream: this child is scamming poeple for 50 dollars  bbh: wait 50 dollars
C H I L D
Dream, bbh, george: Yo sap wanna make a video? Sap: about what? Dream, bbh, george: nothing really, we just wanna tell at you
Son you are disgustin...
When life makes you early, comment.
George, you didn’t have to go so far as to calling SapNap disgusting. You just need to teach him proper selling stuff not be a terrible father and just screaming at him. This is how children get trust issues and social anxiety
When life gives you lemon, yell at Sapnap's overpriced lemonade.😌
OMG HAHAHAHAHAHAHA EVEN HIS DAD HAHAHAHAHHHAAHAHAH SORRRY I CANT STOP LAUGHING I THINK MY FUNNY BONE IS AT ITS LIMIT HAHAHHAHHHHAHHAHAHA
nice
1. I’m glad I was up to watch this 2. WHY WAS THIS UPLOADED AT LIKE 3:30AM GO SLEEP

Nice tpack tho
When Sapnap gets embarrassed for selling lemonade:
Dream revenge for the fort
Looks It's Sapnap Or Kidnap

The part when George said “SON YOU ARE DISCUSSING”😂😂😂😂😂😂 it ended me
Sapnap selling lemonade lol
Hiii
It was 50 cents btw
IM NOT LATE!!
I am 12 toooooooo
Poor sonnap
honestly expected someone to buy the lemonade and him to pull out some massive glass to put it in  and that's why it's $50
Sapnap’s voice is cursed
Why did I find myself cry laughing at this XDD
Omg poor Sapnap, I'm sure he meant *fifteen* you should've gone easy dream 😂
Son you're disgusting   -GeorgeNotFound
When ur mom doesn't give u money *for chores;* $50 lemonade take it or leave it
I- 33 minutes late-
Nice
Only 50 dollars i sell my lemmonade for 80
Plot twist: Son meant to say 50 cents
I love how dream turned everyone against him 🤣
pp
Hi
I thought it would be a dream walked up to the lemonade stand and he ask the man running the stand.
I personally feel attacked by dream’s screaming
Y’all need to stop posting to early
i am a dreamshorts!sapnap apologist. dont worry sapnap i will buy your $50 lemonade
plot twist: dream buys it and he enjoy the lemonade
Hehe
Sad part is they actully be selling it for like 45 dollars per cup lol  That’s a whole 6 flags trip and pizza 😂
Hm
These videos are so stupid that they’re funny
Plot Twist: Sapnap becomes rich since his lemonade recipe becomes big, buying the fort from the last short. Then making Dream jealous.
This channel gives me life SKEIDMDIDOSO
But.... Maybe he meant 50 cent ಥ_ಥ
15 mins ago
Sapnap child voice is killing me

Sapnap: Becomes president Also Sapnap: is 12
Little does dream, bad, and George know that its actually a skyscraper worth of lemonade
Most liked comment.
Then he waddled away...
This is how Sapnap got the fort...
Why do I always catch these when they’ve been posted half an hour ago lol
Snap does the child role pretty good tbh
Sapnap sounded like NotNico
why are yelling at this child
This is basically *dream george and bbh screaming at a child*
the glass of lemonade was probably a gallon
*WeLL wHeN LiFe giVes YoU LemOnS*
Then he waddled away ( waddle waddle)
First
"This Child!!!" - Dream 2021

Who else read "Stand" as "Stan" LMAO...
But where are grapes?

and i thought its going to be piss. idk if i am happy about it or just disappointed /s
oof
Someone tell them how big that glass of lemonade that is... And how good it is 50$ is not a lot
It would be sooo nice if George goes inside the stand from side and punch /slap sapnap at 1:30  That can be more laughable.
Plottwist the cup of lemonade is hella big
hahahaha that's nice
Plot twist it was 50 cents
Yo I’m early
I bet they all laughed at the end and had to cut it like that
Dream : "Your son is selling 50 dollars glass of lemonade!" George : "It's not my fault that Im colorblind..."
Poor young Sapnap can’t catch a break
dream: $50?!?!?!  what the heckkk  mr beast: take my money  o yea headphone users dont play this at vol 100

Kid: does not know value of money Everyone: Time to die
13 mins later  *GETS 40K V I E W S*
Son, you are disgusti-
I love how most of these shorts end with discusting
''Hi im 12'' Famous quote said to a pure stranger
I can't wait for an animation
this is ridiculous that a fight fits in a glass of lemonade!
DIS IS DESGASTING
This is epic
The “son, you are DISGUSTING” at the end was perfection
Sapnap 12 wow
God job that’s gonna be a nice kid and bot a psychopath
Dream: _holds gold ingot_ Also Dream: 50 DOLLARS?!!!
“Son u are disgusting” write that in the quote book ez
Let's all accept George tried to imitiate dream's DISGUSTANG
*$50 DOLLARS!!*
When life gives you lemons you make $50
What a pure kid trying to rip people off.
A wise fish said : “Every Villain Is Lemons".
Poor child.
So sad..... everyone screaming at sapnap. press F to respect
Alternative title: if EA started making lemonades
lmao,  "child u are disgusting" 😂
50 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!
George like son your disgusting 😹
Is this even shorts because the video is landscape and it is over a minute
50$!!! That's impossible it should be more than that
Poor Sapnap. He just wants to sell lemonade ❤️
He has finally received his punishment.
Sometimes sapnap is president and sometimes he is the scanning child 😂🤣🤣😂😅 next time he will be the ....👍😂
Sapnap: **sells lemonade for $50** George, BBH and Dream: *And i took that personally*
50 dollars?
Kidnap is back :D
Im hearing memonade....
i love how peaceful they are to eachother
Ok it feels kind of not fair to roast a child like this. But there are two point of views. First (customers view): 50 dollars for a glass of lemonaid is far overprized. Second (sellers view): he needs to make profit. He took bio lemons and bio and fair trade suger. So he had to spend 49 $ for the suger. He sells the lemonaid for 50 $ and gets 1 $ as profit. That's fair I guess.
lol
Kid Sapnap's name should be "Kidnap". Yes, I know. It fits tbh considering what he does to pets(in MC) first before "playing" with them.
I would pay 50 bucks just to get lemonade from Sapnap
L E M O N A D E s  I S  V E R Y  G O O D :)
Only $50
mrbeast would love to buy lemonade for 50 dollars. except the crews

George is the best dad and most supportive dad who we don't deserve
Uhh sapp
*Now whenever I hear sapnap's real voice I can only think of his kid voice...*
ah yes. Just dream yelling at more children. I guess now that he's in prison he has to find somewhere to live his favorite hobby.
we all know that badboyhalo is actually sapnap's dad
HAHAHAHA U know its bad when even ur dad turns against u 😂
George shouted "You are disgusting!" in the same way that Dream did it in "Dream Team Haunted Mirror..." and I think it's hilarious ahaha

George is colorblind
Again with the flawless sapnap voice acting
