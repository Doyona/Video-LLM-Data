Just too many commercial interruptions.
Nikolas is going to be a real threat for years to come
Way to make Iowa proud Ben!
Let’s go Simon
It was awesome watching this card shred in person, birdied galore 🔥
Great coverage and production, love it
Looks like a beautiful day in Iowa with no chance any bad weather....
I gotta be honest, I just pieced it together that this is the same Dust from Valorant and CSGO. Kinda cool to see him in the same circles of me.
Top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it.  2. No matter where you go, you're there. 3. Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.  4. Honk if you like peace and quiet. 5. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep.  6. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 7. Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway. 8. I intend to live forever. So far so good. 9. National Atheist's Day April 1st.  10. What's another word for "thesaurus"?    Editorial: Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
To much commercials. Can't watch it..
Was that the dude from eastbound and down in the background on hole 1?
Mr. Fish you have won my heart.....Go BRAVES!!
And to think I thought this was just about fat white alcoholics from Florida. I mean it kinda is but at least they remembered to wear nice clothes.
The Sport is growing wow
Go Niklas go.
Please keep the political ads out of this forum
I just want to point out that Nikola went over 30 seconds on hole 8 when he was going for his putt where are the TDs for the time infraction exactly
hole 7 is a septagon ;) 7 sided  great coverage!!
Lmfao this Dustin Mouret guy sounds like a sped up ian anderson. its kinda trippy
Thanks for the coverage.  Hienoa tekemistä Niklas! 🇫🇮
excuse me but if simon was T1 coming into hole 9 and T2 after his birdie, that means someone who was -5 aced it?!
How does the moon cut his hair?      Eclipse it.
Go Braves!!
I need to know how Ben Callaway keeps his damn tucked in shirt stay tightly tucked. I believe in the "look good, play good" model, but if I tuck them they always pull out and get all muffin topped. Help, Ben!
is that Kenny Power's cousin cruising with the group?
Hole 3, didn't Kristin Tattar park that hole for a birdie?
Hey!! Professional Egg tossing next ! Oohhhhh, such self development and dexterity! Such majesty !  Not enough makeup ! .
What's with the hate for this Dustin guy? I haven't tuned into GateKeeper in a while, but he sounded fine on commentary
Nathan's voice was too low, I think.
god, 3 is such a terrible hole. How are we STILL designing poke and pray holes, for elite tour level events, in the year 2022? make a legitimate line the ENTIRE way to the hole, or don't create the hole. just ridiculous.
thank you Gatekeeper Media
Sooo many negative comments.
Wow fish has improved his sidearm a ton!!
Like the coverage and the announcing. One thing I would like to see is the disc being used on their drives (like the other production company does). I do like that you include the shot number they are on each hole. Sometimes easy to lose track of when there are penalties involved.
Love everything but honestly can hardly hear Nathan's voice (I think it's Nathan lol)
That TruBank commersial was wild 😅.
Always love watching Fish!
Another great call and great coverage. Thanks!
The new hole 3 is awesome. They should leave it as is or make it tougher.
30:29  Stumpfest!
what a card
Cmoo suomi, hyvä Anttila
That 4:3 TruBank ad looks like I could've seen it after Ken Climo had just won the 1998 worlds over Scott Stokely.
Why does Nathan's commentary sound like he's doing it through zoom?
Danny McBride sighting behind the pad on #3 lol
What’s a “crab shoot”?? 🤣
Watching on mute because the experience is better not having to hear that Egamer know nothing commentator.. once they bring back someone who can improve the coverage, mute is the only way to watch it. Put on some sublime or GD and enjoy it a lot more
can we take a moment to appreciate how handsome ben callaway is?
Dustin’s commentary has really improved this season, especially when he’s partnered with a pro like Nathan.
The laugh at 18:38 😂
I love that bag check part. I didn't know y'all were doing that
When are you guys going to put Stokely on a feature card???
Hole 3 is trash. Just throwing it out there
Boring commentators
Ben calaway has gotta stope buttoning his polo shirts all the way up, 😂he looks like a middle school yearbook photo at a private school. He rips though haha but dresses like a goofball
love nathan on commentary as always, but dustin has no business commentating such high-level play. will resubscribe when he is removed from the booth. why did humphries have to go? :(
Why am I waiting for Nathan to go “ Ohhh noooo! Peter Griffin has a mustache.”?😂😂
So gatekeeper can get a full round edited, but dgpt can’t get the highlights up…
Almost 3 hours later and no back 9? Where's jomez when ya need them
Still no 4k.... unreal in 2022! WHY NOT???????
A. Fish stopped by our local thurs. dubs round in Iowa city on his way to DMC, he didn’t have time to play but donated a beautiful disc for the Am CTP prize pool!
Sorry I take it back. You only did it for Simon. Please think about doing it all the time
LOVE that you are showing the full flight from the tee pad on 5, and not switching to catch cam.  It’s so disorienting to suddenly zoom to the disc in mis flight. Much nicer to see it all from the tee as the players do.
PS - 37 seconds for Antilla from mini placement to release. #NikkoJr
Who is this Cleveland?this other commentator?
#CallawayStumpRemoval 😁🥏
That's it. Calling in sick. Lol
I enjoy both coverages equally. 🙂
So sick of seeing McBeth and Paige advertisements.
I don’t understand? What’s the scheduling? Looking at PDGA live it doesn’t have everyone even finishing their first round yet? But wasn’t the first round played on Friday?
I hope the guardian trees stay on 3 its makes for a great challenge
Yall need to change the intro music to last year. This year's is barely just ok. Not inspiring enough. It's like kids dream scape music or something. Chang it back. This is a sport not a video game.
Dustin is still commentating? No thanks
Dustin and Nathan on commentary, Simon, Ben, Andrew and Niklas on coverage, what is this? Am I dreaming? This can't be anything but excellent!
Go fish!
Wasn't McBeth supposed to play here, no score on DGPT site. Many other top names without a score as well, e.g. Wichsovski and Heimburgh.
Bag check is very cool!
Simon's skip on 8 was insane?? Wow. Longest skip I've personally ever seen.
Thanks for the entertainment Gatekeeper!
Thanks for trying your best to pronounce a Finnish name 🇫🇮 Finnish is pronouced exactly as written, so no tricks, just read it out. You could also just say Niklas. 🙂
Who knew Kenny Powers was a fan?
Gotta say, GK has really improved their production quality and especially color balance over the past year.
2:38 Mitch Williams sighting.
Simons jumbled up bag of discs gives me anxiety 😂
Making a point today
Good morning fellow disc golfers. Cheers!! ☕️
Gatekeeper wins for coffee and DG this fine Saturday morning.
I was waiting for jomez, but this is just as good.
