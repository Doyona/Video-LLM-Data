Why does the mask look like Griffith
12:35 I know a criminal that was very bad at art!
me when troom troom’s kidnapping life hacks: 💀☠️
why is troom troom aloud to give braindamage to millions of kids
9:40 finally good troom advice and it’s to straight up kill. HUGE step up 😂
Luke 12:32 "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom
5:03 criminals
The funny thing about the duct tape struck is that I’m pretty sure if they had tried to use actual scotch tape, they probably would have cut open their wrists because Scott tape doesn’t break in the same way that duct tape does.
9:43 askin' for a friend
18:58 I see your feet😊
There's criminals everywhere!?!?!
Why does it look like Danny kidnapped Nick 😂
we need to make this stuff illegal😡

2:49 shes a pick me
Michelle where do you get your  scissors frok
6:09 "that's actually a really funny joke, I like that a lot😐"
Crazy that nick is not green is there. I do remember this was the time of the high of his popularity, and i did think he was a cool guy. He was cool here. But after a while his videos started to be... idk, a little weird? There was a weird subtone in them, I can't explain. I stopped watching him at this time, and sometime later all that controversy happened. I really don't know what happened to him, maybe if he acted different he could maintain a youtube carrer. But, you know, this video is still awesome and their dinamic is funny as hell
THIS WAS 4 YEARS AGO?
Its so funny im genuinely wow that was funny, *litteraly looks so concerned
bro just think of any kid seeing you to and the mask he would go to his dad saying he seen a criminal just for his dad to go dont say that son you dont know them but the kid furces the dad to come see just for him to see you 2
10:19 out of context is strange
Im crying from laughing so hard 😂😂😂
the crafting corner is so cute
11:15 Tf you mean perfect
I just wonder how danny learned this is all just kink content...
Am I the only one who noticed the s-x doll in the background at 9:08 time????????
13:50 oh well
Snapping someone’s neck does kill if you do it right.
26:05 his secret base has been revealed.
u remind me of my science teacher
5:00 what makes that even funnier is it's a South Park sound effect
When i read the title for some reason my monkey brain thought that this video was telling you how to kidnap people...
Fabric glue? brother in christ... have you heard of this other invention called "Thread and needle" ? you could've just stitched the sock to make it toed without the glue...
the criminal gun joke was funny until it was overused like 8 times
1:29 me?
7:33  stockholm syndrome at its finest
26:35  he sounds like flamingo whaggt
“It’s the kinda not you’d tie, you fuckin’ square” “JeSuS”
9:32 i just did that to myself (idk whh) and it cracked my neck, 10/10 method would recommend
9:53 HOLY-
7:03 dude that cardboard was expensive😭🙏
Cough parts: 13:06 13:16  13:22  13:35
8:08 HELP ME WHAT HAPPENED? Ah yes, step 2 of how to be Un kidnapped... Break the realm that we thrive in to use it as a door handle to get out, can't forget that one!!!!
In the second video, perhaps she sent them the gift to make up for breaking their vertebrae, as she is a much superior super villain that they unwittingly waylaid and their feeble villainy aroused pity in her heart.
12:25 DANNYE WEST
7:03  Bro that fling is insane
23:17 almost 4 years later and “Arrivederci, losers!” Still lives in my head.

18:10 Nick teaching Caveman Dan how to use hands to pick up objects
The tape thing is real but it's so obviously edited in the troom troom video 😭🙏
Nice skin for a YouTuber? Wow… He better add that to his résumé, i don't think he was going for "internet-famous porcelain doll", but im glad its working-?
I'm first to comment on this video I swear 😭😅🎉🎉🎉
Imagine being kidnapped, Somehow get away, Then you see this troomtroom video
Kidnappers watching this vid to not make mistakes
3:35 its funny cause thats her hand
Question. Is there a reverse Stockholm Syndrome? Where the captor forms an emotional bond with the captee?
"this is nick, he is my assailant"
4:55 HARUBHABABAA—
“Guys, testing those life hacks was a lot of work It was rough, it was tough, and it was kinda dangerous AH. 💔”
13:44 i didn't hear anything before OR after "the toe suck-on"  love the vid <3
10:18 how did she rip that in half and who is constantly wearing this one scarf. You go straight for the sack.
Don't take the scarf off, dude, your head will fall off!
I love that so much 27:20
15:14  pov me every time i do a something with glue i guess
Stooop I’m really sick and it’s kinda hard to laugh because my throat is sore and he’s making me laugh so hard 😂 Keep doing what you do Danny, I love your content ❤️
Really not a fan of a kids oriented channel encouraging playing with matches and plastic
With rhinoshield you can keep your phone safe while you get kidnapped
Why does Troom Troom have to have the worst voice overs ever
31:15 is my favorite part
Why are they so surprised that duct tape rips? 😂 Isn't that the point of the tiny dots on the duct tape? So you can tear it instead of using scissors 🤣
Last one works with zip-ties too
19:07 he’s so in love
Troom troom's bizarre adventure
I wanna go back to when I didn't know those videos existed... Thanks.
How many layers would that duct tape trick work? I remember when i first saw it.   I only tried two though Lol
duct tape is designed to tear, of course it works, if it doesnt its cus youzabish
9:42 yes it kills someone by giving them a stroke
5:04 so what’s funny is I just found out the old Cant language Polari (used by criminals and the LGBTQ+ community to keep the law from detecting them) used to have a version where you could say something like “The rozzers will take him for a gun if they vada him,” meaning “The cops will know he’s a thief if they see him dressed like that.” Basically, this means “gun” was once a slang term for “thief.” All of this is of course to say—once upon a time, you could call a criminal a gun. I don’t think Troom Troom knows that but it’s still funny to me lmao
12:53 GRIIIIFFFFFIIIITTH
I am fully shocked the duct tape hack worked
7:02 stokholm syndrome
11:51 are you getting strangled: yeah
11:53 they probably just did it for tax write-offs
I wish he had gotten someone else for this like Jarvis or something bc I hate nick
10:47 maybe when you need to wear a scarf you wear this one instead?
You have no idea how funny this is at 2:47 AM
13:49 why not I would love it
29:01 this had so much aura
Is no one gonna talk about the finger socks??? No, just me..okay...
No one survived to tell that troom troom’s life hacks were bad, because it didn’t work 😭
i feel like they would keep a criminal holding a gun-i mean criminal in front of the cage or wherever you are
The fact that scotch tape wouldn't break because of what it's made of and duct tape is what's used more often is hilarious to me...
16:29 😭😭😭😭
arrivederci losers!
this is one of my fav danny vids :D it was the first vid he uploaded since i became a fan in oct 2021 !! it's super special to me. so disappointing how nick turned out though :/
troom troom is telling kids to play with matches
16:25 to 16:32 is gold
Note: if ur kidnapped don’t take a gun just wrap yourself with a blanket 👍 6:26
“ …How much force I would have to put in to throwing it back to crush someone” 😃🍑 -Danny 10:17
10:33 the skirf
The @nickisnotgreen collab aged horribly   ...    No wonder he is kidnapping danny-(THATS A JOKE)
Fire alarm spotted 16:00  alongside a pull station (very blurry)
Oh yes a carbon fiber phone case perfect for making my hands itch
14:09 HE HAS PUNCTURED THE FOOT CONDOM
gotta love how the victims are all female
i was eating bread while watching this video and started laughing at the sound effects around 10:15 and nearly choked to death on my bread
yesterday i tried the duct tape hack. it was difficult as hell because i had no one to help me but it actually worked. hurt my wrists though
I kinda want to try the duct tape thing lol
5:36 RAPPERS DO
How nice of the kidnapper to coach through escaping
I love the random ass photo of you drinking water in the background
1:38 as someone who has been done dirty by Martin. Thank you for this
Looollll
I need to reload my criminal
I think I have watched this already, yeah fun to watch again... Until...  Hear the room from voice
8:48 this is actually a method coaster enthusiasts like myself use to avoid being “stapled” basically theres a thing called airtime which is basically negative g forces and in order to get more of it we use the method to insure there is more space between us and the restraint
Im UR FAN ❤❤❤❤❤
4:48 fun fact: that noise is from South Park!
The narrator’s voice is infuriating. I hope it’s AI
14:45 as a seamstress who uses glue relatively frequently, hot glue is actually better for certain fabrics. it's much more viscous so stays in place easier and doesnt seep through mesh. it also has a much tighter hold for a much lower pricetag. for example, when i make fursuits i tend to use hot glue because it keeps the upholstery foam together and doesnt seep through the fur fabric (trust me, you do NOT want glue on faux fur).
17:33 HE LOOKS SO EMBARRASSED 😭😭
As an italian i found the arrivederci gag waild…. Hahahaha not aspected at all hahaha SAIONARA LUSERRR
5:36 people would disagree Danny
9:33 Wouldn’t work
8:50 No way in hell that would actually help
“Guys, guns don’t kill people. Criminals kill people. And criminals are guns.” - Batman
8:36 Why’d he sniff it 😭
Fyi, arrivederci means goodbye in Italian. The correct pronounciation is Arreve-eh-derci (you roll the rs)
The Xbox player   I have to watch from the sidelines until HD2 comes to Xbox
Just be poor; the kidnappers are looking for people to buy them a new TV.
0:22 I’m being kidnapped 😊😊😊
3 years later and i only just realised they have the sims 3 theme in the background
I like to imagine that every trick they do they’ve used because they keep on being kidnapped because of their content
8:36 why is he sniffing the chain?! 😭
10:10 push the seat backwards to C R U S H  H I M
Kinda shocked the duct tape thing worked, cause I saw a Navy Seal try it and he couldn’t break it. I think he tried it with way more than 3 layers though
These Troom Troom videos must have been ghostwritten by Jeffrey Epstein
9:43 I mean it killed Loki. (IM SORRY I LOVE LOKI)
Why does the pistol have a shotgun shell
Is that a Costa Rica shirt?
Actually there's usually an emergency release latch inside car trunks (it looks like a tag), so try that. Also not to put a bummer on things, but generally speaking your odds of survival in a real-life abduction drop significantly if you are taken to a second location.   Generally speaking if someone is trying to force you to go to a secondary, then you are at a 90% chance of not making it out alive. There are hundreds of real murders where people, mainly women, are abducted at the threat of violence and are later found murdered and oftentimes raped. Even in cases of people being kidnapped and held hostage like this, they rarely make it out alive. The real advice here that anyone will give you is this; do NOT let an abductor take you to a secondary location, you're going to want to make a lot of noise like screaming or set off an alarm. Even if someone is pointing a gun at you, you need to run and get away. Do not comply, RUN. Even if you get shot at, your odds of survival are better at a primary location than they are at a secondary.
IM THE LATEST!!!!!!

what a nice gift to leave them after her stay!
Im a therian, and i make masks. I am currently making a mask while watching this.
1:07 anyone else ever notice the sims music in the background? Sims 3 to be specific. I always hear the soundtrack in these videos lol
no way its nick from queef jerky
"Good job martan thats a felony!" is actually hilarious
league of legends💀💀 imagine buying one of those cases that’s mad embarrassing
12:36 there's a certain criminal that had a passion for the arts
6:06 its a birth defect
27:50 This is the best reveal
So it’s not common knowledge that duct tape is tearable?
So people really don’t know that duct tape is flimsy?
28:00 if you're using cable ties, there's a method kidnappers use to counter this. On the part of the zip tie that goes through the loop, the excess bit, they cut it so it's sharp and pointy, and APPARENTLY it stops you from using this technique.
Bro im not greg😭😭🙏🙏
Why is the scarf bit so funny
Danny be like criminals kill people, but guns do not kill people🧠💥😅
for scp: 21:59 , 23:10 , 23:13*, 26:42 *, 26:51 , 28:41 *
As a fellow mine crafter myself, I am very disappointed in Danny for not calling this (12:07) a crafting table
As someone named Skylar... I honestly feel deeply ashamed
I love people learning that duct tape is meant to rip easily🥰
I haven’t laughed that hard in a bit
I love the thumbnail because after Danny is lit on fire, nick isn't seen behind him, which implies that he just fled immediately after Danny caught fire
STOP THIS WHOLE VIDEO MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD
I used to watch troom troom please do a video on their zombie apocalypse videos
“Are u being strangled?” “Yea…” 😂😂😂
Dont forget to tip your kidnapper
The narrator chick is psycho I hate her tone.
Snapping your neck is like popping your neck I do it to stretch
2:05 You joke, but isn't that what is LITERALLY recommended? The general idea is that your life is worth more than any material gain, and so you should prioritize getting out of the situation before trying to get your shit back.
7:18  My look exactly.
I learned a lot from this video most important always thank you kidnapper after escaping the kidnappers pay them money
5:59 it’s the family business? Crine
The title is kinda confusing tbh , I legit thought that they were gonna teach people how to kidnap someone more effectively which sounds weird already not even considering how dumb that channel already is and we all know that Danny Gonzalez always gets a kick out of it when doing these things anyways . lol
11:15 it’s funny because it’s quite obviously edited XD
a square knot is a real knot (I’m not trying to bait anyone) it’s the kind you tie to do your shoelaces- it *is* a real knot, and is very typical. You cross and tuck one end under. I know that because I make Kandi. you usually tie like three to make singles and you can even tie like six knots. there’s also ways to tie it around which it’s hard to explain in a comment.. but it’s to tie off an X-base cuff which is the typical base for 3D cuffs.
7:46 “quick! quick! throw her in the trunk!” THE TONE IS TAKING ME OUT OMG
5:05 UNINTENTIONAL SOUL EATER REFERENCE‼️
1:34 I think they’re trying to Narrator their Dialogue instead of having the Narrator be on the Kidnappers Side
troom troom videos make my brain feel empty.
Sirius James ahh core
when i start spitting at my screen danny just looks at me: 0_o         22:30
im literally listening to FUCKING BANGARANG LOW QUALITY
😂😂AHAHAHAH ❤❤
troom troom made me learn how to tie my shoe when i was small XD
Somehow Danny managed to wear the scarf right…. Backwards
"its so boring in here" what. what do you mean.
24:52 is so. Beautiful.
0:14
Help my names skylAr 😭
4:48 THAT'S RANDY MARSH. THAT'S THE NOISE RANDY MARSH MAKES. I SWEAR ON MY LIFE.
“Gotcha girlie 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💜😍💜💜💜😍😍😍💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜😍😍😍💜😍💜😍😍😍😍😍😍”
The baby heads got me on the floor, laughing 5:53
4:41 you know this is how a lot of porn starts
THE MORE LAYERS THE MORE PAIN. i broke out of up to 17 layers before my wrists were bruised and shit and couldnt keep going
WTH happened here 8:07
Hi Danny love your vids um are you going to do the zombies 3 movie?
Nick is not good :(
11:48 Bucciarati after violently murdering someone
15:31 WHO WEARS SCARVES LIKE THAT YOU MENACE
7:41 what was that Danny?
3:35 I'm trying to picture how she could've possibly done this with her foot.
Crazy I completely forgot Nick was in this video  Eish
3:35 I love how it is so obvious that it is a hand holding that match
Snapping the neck does in fact kill people. They teach us that in self defense at karate (they do not teach it to kids because kids don’t really understand the dangers of snapping someone’s neck) and it’s been drilled into my head to only do that in extreme situations because it will kill someone. To be fair, I would consider a kidnapper attempting to kill you a valid reason to snap their neck.
Bazinga
Aw I miss Nick 😢
1:03 loony toons ass kidnappers
I love how silly danny is
7:16 GIGGLING. THE FACE.
I miss this version of Nick so much :(
I'm crying a lot these days. This is truly the most beautiful and best-organized story ever. I can't believe how magical 1:12 was. This part actually made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34, this part was so moving that words cannot describe the range of emotions I felt. I loved the climax, it had incredibly great detail. Oh, and we can't forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the biggest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen, better than any book I have ever read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. It's basically the most important masterpiece in the history of cinema. It's a tragedy that this cannot be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience that will be inaccessible to most. It beautifully sums up the human struggle down to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with characters in the audience, repressed entities in our own subconscious. It remains vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a statement about what it means to be human. Fun, exciting and just plain joyful. This may be the most impressive work of art I have ever encountered, and I will definitely return to it in the near future to study it in more detail. this is an absolute masterpiece, it brought me to tears hearing it and seeing the chip spin around countless times. It absolutely touched my soul and I don't think I will ever be the same. this bacon changed my entire state of mind, now I am at peace with who I am and what I will do later in my life. I have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a pacifist. I'm moving on, I've got to move on, as the song says. chip is very inspiring, he shares his immense wisdom with all of us and we are all very lucky to have been blessed with his wonderful words. we are all children on a chip. hail chip. hail chip. The spinning chip, spinning in one direction with that music... It made me cry. How could a piece of bacon do such a thing? I am impressed with this masterpiece. Especially when the token rotates, revealing yellow skin lightly covered in salt. I can hear the squeaking noise from here, as well as the beautiful sound of wood shavings scraping against the soft, dark velvet floor. Taste, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from the screen. You can really hear the gasps between the musical artist as she empathizes with her love for this bacon swirl. Truly what I call modern art. It was the most legendary performance of any chip I have ever seen. The performance was top notch and very life changing. 17:24. I'm crying a lot these days. This is truly the most beautiful and best-organized story ever. I can't believe how magical 1:12 was. This part actually made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34, this part was so moving that words cannot describe the range of emotions I felt. I loved the climax, it had incredibly great detail. Oh, and we can't forget the conclusion.

It beautifully sums up the human struggle down to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put into this is incredibly inspiring. Graphics, animation, music, a lot of thought. It reminded me that you can do anything you set your mind to. Not to mention the memories, it makes me feel like a child again, just looking at this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. From this I understand again what happiness is. Not to mention the most amazing part, 2:10. Chip Spin changed my life for the better. It connects with characters in the audience, repressed entities in our own subconscious. It remains vibrant, fresh and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while expressing what it means to be human. Fun, exciting and just plain joyful. This may be the most impressive work of art I have ever encountered, and I will definitely return to it in the near future to study it in more detail. this is an absolute masterpiece, it brought me to tears hearing it and seeing the chip spin around countless times. It absolutely touched my soul and I don't think I will ever be the same. this bacon changed my entire state of mind, now I am at peace with who I am and what I will do later in my life. So much great visuals, so much tension, so much awesomeness in this movie. I have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a pacifist. I'm moving on, I've got to move on, as the song says. Bacon is so inspiring, he shares his immense wisdom with all of us and we are all so lucky to have been blessed with his wonderful words. we are all children on a chip. hail chip. hail chip.

I can hear the squeaking noise from here, as well as the beautiful sound of wood shavings scraping against the soft, dark velvet floor. Taste, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from the screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, feeling her love for this spinning chip. Truly what I call modern art. It was the most legendary performance of any chip I have ever seen. The acting was top notch and very life changing. This is some of the best chip work I've ever seen, especially at 57:42. I'm crying. It put me on an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat myself up and also watched the movie while watching this premiere. It cost me a lot. Thanks to this, I got through depression. This truly inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
I ate some gummies and laughed through the whole video…thank you🎉 10/10
the title makes it sound like advice for kidnapping
these troom troom hacks are just normal gothem civilian tips
15:09 a doctor performing their first circumcision
why buy a ps5 but no tv
Kevin and Martin slayed this entire lifehack.
I feel like that duck tape one would be a good party trick
13:37 NEVAHH
Troom troom highered Dora the Explorer post Nickelodeon
10:03 "while the attacker is stunned by your agility push the seat backwards to crush them" the troom troom narrator said with joy 😂😰
10:18 what
hi I know Im 3 years late for this but dont most vehicles now have automatic driver seat adjusters? So in reality youd just be slowly moving backwards and the attacker could just move...
I JUST REALIZED I DIDNT HAVE NOTIFICATIONS ON😱 (i just turned it on)
4:38 Didn't see that one coming...
6:49  they have a ps5 but no tv?
I’m pretty sure the narrator is gypsy rose
oh i forgot nick was in this video, now i hate it.
thank you danny because of this video im a guy named greg who lives in kurtis town
I used to love this one but Nick ended up being such a pos, and when the people he hurt tried to privately get him to take accountability he disappeared off the face of the earth.
oof i totally forgot nick was in this video 💀💀
is NickXDanny real
8:08 what even happened here 😨
Wait till he finds out troomtroom is low scale f😢tish content
I love the kidnapper. So nice. He was so nice to Danny even though he kidnapped Danny
4:30 WHY ARE GM_CONSTRUCT!?
4:49 why did this make me laugh?
I really should've used these hacks that one time I got kidnapped! My mother wouldn't stand a chance against... matches.
GOD DAMMIT. WHY DID DANNY HAVE TO WEAR SOCKS
The duct tape thing is real because duct tape is really easy to rip if you rip it right spoilers she didn't
14:28 Welp, we have Centaur Danny and Centaur Kurtis.   Now I'm just picturing Drew and their other friends green screening themselves into Cantaurs so they can all run together in a herd.....  I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight with such a blursed image galloping through my mind's eye. 😂
I can see what's happening here.... This was a testing ground for the foot fetish Onlyfans page, he ended up making a year later.
I can't believe they didn't get Scarlett anything to eat she know she's hungry
The real question is who kidnaps and doesn't have a dungeon come on It's 2025
9:22 i had to put my phone down and laugh for a solid minute after seeing this, like why did she have to straight up kill him???
I had to check the channel, what a horrible place, brain rot videos everywhere. That kind of content should not be on YT.
9:03 So, are we just going to... Ignore that line?
THE CAR CHAIR RECLINE LMFAO 🤣🤣🤣
13:55 not for free? then how much
13:06 when he said " I think these little Black fuzzies" it kept making me laughing. For some dumb reason I laugh at "Little Black fuzzies"
Danny let me out of the basement plsase😢
Danny puffing his cheeks out while holding his breathe is sending me 😂 Did he never play an instrument or is he just doing that to look stupid. Because like seriously puffing your cheeks is preventing more air from coming in.
13:32 "I'M BATMAN 👹."
Compared to the garbage that AI is making, this almost feels nostalgic. Almost.
I couldn’t even watch this one all the way through because the original video was such brainrot and it made me feel sad
"God, get outta my throat". That's what she said
6:15 can we talk about how good his impression of the Wii sports announcer is
So the kidnappers got a whole ass dungeon but no tv??
4:49 is my face when troom troom 😞
i m now greg
As a fellow Martin I’m very happy to announce I am doing a great job!
16:05 Very Cool Danny wearing Costa Rica shirt! Pura Vida!
4:38
12:56 villagers in minecraft
I do want to say a really good bit of knowledge for actually escaping being kidnapped. Most cars will just have a plastic covering on the back trunk that can be removed or some way to access the lock of the trunk from the inside so you can escape if you’re stuck in a car.
"there's always an Alexa"
Nick is the best 😆
15:09 circumcision
Danny: Do you know how to tie a square knot?  Nick: No. What's a square knot?   Danny: It's the kind of knot, you'd tie, you fucking square  Nick & Danny: *Loses it*  Fav part
So sigma
I appreciate that he mentioned he won't show his feet on the internet *for free*
9:48 it’s actually almost impossible to snap someone neck just with your hands. Movies have been gaslighting us 😔
I love that Nick came away from this video without knowing for sure if a square knot is a real kind of knot
I know this video is super old but you definitely missed a circumcision joke at 15:15. I'm so disappointed in you.
7:19 that face sums up my thoughts perfectly… :/
Two kind if Troom Troom life hacks for kidnaped victimes:  If you are captive in a car, get out of the car and run.  If you happen to be very skilled with your feet, wear toe socks, be held captive in a place with no locks and a clear path outside, have your arms and hands caffed with a material vulnerable to fire but have your feet free and happen to be left alone for a long time with 19th century matches that can be lit in any surface or, alternatively, be left with modern matches and a match box: then light the match with your skillful feet, free your hands and run away from youe goofy ahh captors.
Arrivederci Is bye in italian
two grown-ass men discovering that duct tape is perforated in order for it to tear easily so you don't have to cut it
you  cant strike a match without a striker unless they are strike anywere matches the matches in the video arent strike anywere
I love how the mask looks like a wrestlers mask
15:07 jewish people like 3000 years ago for some reason
GRIFITHHHHH!!!
10:07
People always say my toe socks are weird but we’ll see who’s laughing when they get kidnapped and can’t pick up the match.😼
This was my first Danny video and still my fav!!
Not enough people have mentioned the Alexa. I am choosing to assuming Danny didn’t know it was there. Just deciding to ask Alexa a question for a bit and an Alexa RESPONDING is INSANE and I’m HYSTERICAL
Remember, according to danny, you can be strangled without a scarf.
3:11 bro her socks are eating her toes!
24:58 this whole bit with Danny going “now I crush his bones” then just completely stoic in his chair as it slowly reclines kills me every time
9:53 LOL
17:20 The scream💀
9:30 😂😂😂😂that one got me
as long as breath comes from mouth  i may but stand the slightest chance. a sliver of light is all i need to cease the darkness killing me!
is bro using that Griffith drip 13:33
Sometimes, I come back to this video because only this 13:50
Matches your new one with kurt. 🎉
If ur kidnapped with zip ties and you can’t break one zip tie, maybe getting kidnapped for lack of try is in ur best interest 😅
9:09 WAS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
Nobody's talking by about when he said throwing it back to crush them??
Flex tape will fix that
my whole life i thought it was duck tape
I've been stuck in a dungeon for 3 years but finally I'm free. These clever kidnappers blocked Troom Troom on their devices so if I managed to steal one I couldn't seek help but thanks to your video I managed to learn their secrets! These fools played with matches next to my dungeon cell but also forgot to actually lock it so I snuck away! You saved my life Danny!
17:12
Ok just wanna say, for the **ahem** snapping the neck part. It seems like the kidnapper was attempting to do the RNC on her, which is a very effective choke that, if held long enough, could in some cases eventually become lethal. Anyways I took a martial arts class at a point and if she was able to reach back and grab his head then he was not doing it right. When properly doing the RNC the person your doing it on would not be able to do that.

GRIFFITH!!!!!!!!!!
So…strike anywhere matches don’t really exist anymore 😂 - gonna need to paint that wall with phosphorous if you want that to light 🤷🏼‍♀️😅
Danny when youre being tied up breathe out as much as possible to make urself bigger giving yourself more room to escape when u breathe in 😅
Arrivederci means see you again, it’s italian
I'm learning Italian and arrivederci means goodbye or just bye. I've watched this video over 13 times and i'm still not sick of it. ❤❤
Life hack ❌ Hack life ❌ Half life ✅
I thought “awful” said “awesome” for a second 😭
"You mean this???" Ahh he's back😦
28:57
Hear me out…               Nick.
tuba ot
"They're legally not allowed to chase you" well.. I mean, yeah
Yknow looking back at this,those videos we're problably made so they could write it off as business expenses
bro looks like griffith
Missed opportunity to call it "trying troom troom's terrible tricks"
The 4:49 made me laugh😂
"Are you getting strangled?" Y E S
10:01 scarves don’t tear that easy… edit: if you lean the seat back the attacker could reach forward and grab you head
Every video he shows fsr look like the beginning of a p*rn :D
dude when he asked alexa what arrivederci means mine answered- he was right, there IS an alexa everywhere
All fun n games ‘til we get troom troom military life hacks.  Oh no! Andy finds himself stuck in a trench fighting bad guys! Luckily, he’s watched troom troom and knows some life hacks!  Andy aims and shoots for the legs cause he knows that’s where the femoral artery is!
Holp up, this video came out 3 years ago? I remember watching this right as it came out!
Hey so the matches they used are called "strike anywhere" matches. Its the same kind you see in old cowboy movies. They've been classified as "dangerous goods" and are illigal to ship vis usps, so you probably won't be able to find them anywhere.
12:00 how do you think they get their actors and editors

these work really well if you're being kidnapped by the crooks from home alone
3:07 WHY DO HER SOCKS HAVE EACH INDIVIDUAL TOE?!
The “Give me your, get, get, get in the car!” Was my fav part 😂 12:43
I love watching videos you making me laugh so much😂😂😂
I love to watch your videos you're so funny❤❤❤
how was this three years ago.?.?.?.??..?? i feel old
If troom trooms going to joke about kidnapping, you should make it, well, you know, funny
Note: if ur kidnapped don’t take a gun just wrap yourself with a blanket 👍 6:39
13:49 But Danny you’ve already been barefoot in your liver king video 😭
0:14 did anyone else noticed the sims 3 cas theme song in the back
I love how they don't realize that it's very difficult to find a match that's not a safety match, meaning you need the box to light it.
His videos always makes me feel so much better
Gyatcha girlie
The tape works if you pull it on your stomach
"gotcha girly" is the most iconic line delivered by any kidnapper ever
hes so funny i cant
The way he just made references to the video in front of nick without showing him the video is DIABOLICAL
The narrator sounds like that girl from making fiends
I know at this point Troom troom aren't even pretending to be legit but this seems like actually awful to make fake advice to kids being abducted...
2:14 give the kidnappers everything you want
9:25 the guy looks mortified when teh girl snaps his friends neck
The voice is extremely infuriating I dont know how anyone could watch Troom Troom
That would be horyfing if your actually kidnapped and this all you can think of “‘great Job Kevin”
13:55 "for free" FOR FREE?! are you gonna show them for money then?!😟
9:10 ARIBADURCHI LOSERS✌️
When i saw the title i thought troom troom had hacks on how to kidnap ppl instead of when ur kidnapped 😭😭
I tried these acts and they totally worked
in honor of having finished rewatching all of dannys troom troom videos again, ill admit that i was literally OBSESSED with troom troom when i was around 12.. i wouldnt watch anything else but them and id watch each of their videos about a hundred times until i could say their them word for word.. i was a weird kid
13:48 "and im not gonna be bare foot" now: FOX SZN
4:47  lmaooooo this is solo funny danny’s reaction right here is hilarious 😂
4:47  lmaooooo this is solo funny danny’s reaction right here is hilarious😂😂😂😂
9:53 Halloween 1978 moment Annie should have just pushed the seat back to CRUSH HIM
something about this video is so funny… I remember when it first came out and I watched it in the early hours of the morning in my room and I got yelled at by my brother from the other room for giggled too loud
At 9:08 why is there a damn naked body
Guys! Guys! Guys!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There’s criminals everywhere!
I think the fact he said for free implies that he’ll do it for payment
23:29 The timing of that is wild 😭
13:21 I’ve been laughing at this for too long
3:44 I love how it looks like a breaking news title
Was a can of toxic waste
dude looks like venom if he had a botched surgery
Bro your hilarious 😂😂😂 i havent laughed this hard in a while only your vids man
8:45 why she say gayt
Fat people are harder to kidnap
I never realised there´s sims music in the background of this video. It freaked me out, I thought I had opened the sims accidentally
1:27 why is she taking pictures of it? if I just saw a giant version of a cardboard box trap sitting in the middle of the pavement I would not start taking pictures or selfies with it. I would just walk around it.
It is actually kind of impossible for a human to snap another humans neck, at least with your bare hands 😊
9:48 no, it doesnt. was kinda dissapointed when i found out :/
The only troom troom vid i like is the zombie ones because it tells u how to make weapons lov your vids btw
Stan and Mitch lookin’ ahh mask at first
My friend just said you look like a combo of James Charles and Ben from Camp Cretatious
What if I’m using an iPad?
There's definitely a TikTok-viral dark romance book with this exact plot.
Troom Troom's writers aren't kidnappers. Troom Troom's writers were kidnapped, and are trying to convince Troom Troom that they will buy them gaming consoles if they release them.
Usually, when a person is tied up, they're tied up to a chair with arms, they wrap it around the victim and then insert the rope in the holes on the arms of the chair so like it's can't be lifted, yk   (... don't ask me how I know)
17:32 Danny_scream.mp4
The duct tape method also works with zip ties I think their weaker than people think
12:12  when he said this it was exactly 11:00 pm for me..
the way i exhaled when danny put on the homemade mask 😭
Oh my god her voice is so unbelievably annoying
Do y'all remember when troom troom had like 100k subs and made actual fun and normal diys
I just realized that this video was the first time I ever saw Nick lol. I didn’t start watching his channel until this year. I forgot all about this video.
6:10 I feel he missed good “son of a gun” joke
"She grabs his chin with one hand, then pulls his neck sharply with the other"  Caaaaaarl, that kills people
Are you tied up with Scott tape? Perfect! 😀
8:40 is literally what horses do when you put a saddle on them
are you getting strangled?
23:53 bros flexing on us with the tesla
9:09 this is a jids channel right? that mannekin in the background makes mebthink otherwise
the narrator's voice is unbearable
10:20 never thought Danny was gonna say that
you didnt understand the philosofical meaning of this, its a reference to stockholm syndrome and how it can be harmfull and cost you a tv.
How does he have a ps5 controller but not a ps5
Troom troom is actually on epic which is my SCHOOLS go to reading and watching videos app
13:54 ned flames would disagree
The narrator's voice is sending me!! Like no idea what they are going for except for people to comment wtf or whatever. The guy def felt left out "I wanna kidnap someone :C"
10:18 HUH
The "........Just get out of the car" at 8:17 made me laugh more than it should have
my collar bone hurts from laughing.... i don't think if that's normal
13:25 Griffith
Trying to light safety matches on a wall.... FFS our generation is dumb!  The striker is designed specifically not to do that..
I love how Danny describes the ski mask as "perfectly wrong," That is the perfectly right way to describe it...the best part is that the mouth hole shows so much of his face that he can be identified.
hey if you just bite/squeeze the boxy part of the zip tie it will come undone
The kidnappers are real G's for this
3:45 Relies way too much on out of control variables...
22:04 got me banging on my table laughing at how ridiculous this all was.
What's up with the picture in the background?
10:48 CACKLING SM
“There is criminals everywhere”😂
Todays mission: Get your friends and all wear ski masks and walk down town
Arrivederci losers!!!!!111!!
0:03 “ARE YOU GETTING STRANGLED 😃 ?”
SIMS 3 MUSIC
21:36 Danny when the store has completely run out of lacroix and small nutcrackers
Next time I get kidnapped, I will politely inform them that what they are doing is against the law. And then they legally have to let me go.
THE DIRECT CONTACT WHILE HE SLIDE OUT OF THE ROPE IS HILARIOUS AHHH LMAO
Why does she keep saying “Arrivederci” As far as I know troom troom isn’t Italian so 😅
future missing person danny gonzales...
THE POOR GUYS NEEECK 😭😭
29:38 flamingo ad ahh msuic
i wonder if danny disassociated from nick after it came out he was a horrible person and perpetuated a scheme to get super mega cancelled that ended up failing
Guys, when's the feet reveal.
Bro, stop making me laugh. I almost choked. Eh. I can never watch you because you make me laugh, bro. I’m almost choked two times.😂
Did you buy self striking matches? You can’t strike regular matches on just anything 😅
9:22 This is so dangerous. Children watch these brain dead videos… So they see the Troom Troom villain get up unharmed after she snaps his neck and think that might be a fun thing to try with their friends??
him putting on the mask killed me lmao
ARRIVADERCI?? IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
"guns don't kill people, criminals kill people, and guns are criminals." -Danny Gonzalez, 2021
Aww I thought this was hacks on how to kidnap people :’(
The title makes it sound like you the kid napper
"Uhh let me out of this dungeon. Not because it's scary, it's just kind of lame." The most April Ludgate line ever.
as someone who wears toe socks every day, i’m ready for anything.
The one where it says to tense up while you're being tied up is real. My friend in high school taught some kids in my theater class this one and we actually all tried it, and it worked!
when he said "no" my headphones turned off
I mean, according to Illinois law legally are allowed to chase you 8:29
Criminals.
“Got kidnapped :/“
I don’t like that troom troom used an overweight lady. They could have just used one of their old actresses or even actor and to me it feels like they are saying overweight people are easy to kidnap.
Holy smokes.  Is Danny O.K.?  Does he know what “satire” is?  Please, someone, help him out.
I love how the lady bent reality and made the guy dissapear when pushing the seat back with a calm face
arrivederci
I think my kidnapper saw this video :( not one coincidence has happened
"Arrivederci, losers"
"gotcha girlie?"
"what's a square knot?" "the kind of knot you'd tie you fuckin square"
8:13 actually references some good advice (although they don’t explain it at all)  It’s actual police advice in kidnapping situations to always take an opportunity to escape if it presents itself. People sometimes choose not to risk an escape attempt in kidnapping situations because they’re afraid that they might get hurt for doing so. The advice makes sense though because any opportunity you pass up is going to guarantee you’ll stay trapped but any opportunity taken gives you a chance
You wanna know a real life hack if you are handcuffed with zip ties? On almost all zip ties there is a little lever in the box part that when pushed down completely loosens and undoes the zip tie. I used to use zip ties to fiddle with for this reason.
The first troom troom video was more close to a comedy adventure film than an actual tutorial to help get out of a kidnapping.
ok but wait now im geniunely curious how many layers of duct tape it would take for the method of striking against your stomach to not work
Arrivederci is goodbye in Italian 9:10
In the first video she just got Stockholm syndrome
DANNY I CAN SEE UR FISH MOUTH AND SO CAN CHADCHAD (not really)❤❤this is a joke btw.
10:18 accept mine is electric😭
Help the narrator sounds like Mickey mouse 😭
So there was a KJ logo but when TSB won the votes THEY REMOVED THE LOGO
Ok but like did you know there was an Alexa? bc I legit cried laughing that she responded to you oh my god
For the second one people walking by must think there actually kidnaps.
10:15 how much force you would have to put in to what?
Shockingly enough, that first hack with the matches has worked before, and ultimately led to the downfall of a horrible serial killer named Robert Berdella
10:18 AYO?
Stockolm friggin' syndrome these videos
considering you can easily rip off pieces of duct tape, I dont know why I was that suprised that it worked...
i subed and turned on notifactaions i am truly greg  can i get a shoutout now
love that danny somehow thought that keeping his arms straight just swinging them down woukd break the tape
What i learned from the video: How to cut duct tape if you kidnapped
23:28 theres a cut here
gotcha girly!
i feel like the duct tape thing is such a popular thing you even see in like.. teen series for lil girls, and american action movies so like- you not knowing it, is almost as embarrassing as you thinking it was impressive for them to know it- xD
9:11 is that a Jojo reference
Fun fact: Arriveiderci means goodbye in italian!!
Is that... Tom Hollands character from Spies in Disguise?
arrivederci is goodbye in italian
The tape one is a real police method
When she escapes the chains WHAT THE HECK IS THAT MANEQUIN DOING OF A N*KED WOMAN ISINT THIS A KIDS CHANNEL
What is with the Olive Oyl voice on that narrator? 😂
Pls turn me to a greg
GRIFFTH!!!!
This was sooo funny
I was being strangled, then I looked this video up. I'm alive now thanks to this video!
Ill give you actural advice every car has an emergency trunk opener that usually glows in the dark
Danny you need to pull your hands apart when you swing them that’s how the tape breaks 😭😭
You could have easily hit him with the seat if you didn't use the worst car brand ever. Ew.
You actually can get out of a body chain if you tense up. The only thing is, they’ll definitely come after you😭
omg danny today i was doing my duolingo lesson and found out arrivederci is italian for goodbye and i immediately thought of this video
Strangling a guy: “i feel like I’m actually strangling u dude”
The reason the duct tape thing worked is because it’s designed to rip easily - you just need to hold one end and rip straight done to get a clean rip when you’re using it.
Duct tape is made to rip. That's what the dotted lines are for. If they really want you to stay put they'd use electrical tape.
Arrivederci id goodbye in italian
The intro is crazy “are u getting strangled” bro wtf😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
31:15 POV: You stand up but you have a Iron defficiencey
Production of those video's should come with minimum prison sentences.
anybody else notice that this man has 6.66m subs?
i was watching the part about picking up matches with your toes while trying to light a candle with a match and my match broke in half and landed on the carpet (lit) and i picked it up with my toes
Troom troom also does fish abuse horrible channel 😢
imagine a real kidnapper saw this
11:21 ahout out to my girlies who saw this on mc squared first ✊
Hack #2 is medieval
16:06 nickisnotgreen... yay...  😅
I don't know how to explain this without sounding really sarcastic but... Scarves are already cut in half. You can attach the velcro to the ends of the scarf.
I clicked on this video expecting Danny to call out a legitimate channel posting bad life hacks, but it looks like he's just taking obvious skit videos seriously. I can't tell if Danny is also joking or not.
With the breathe in when being tied up..I mean what you did worked but I think they meant completely fill your lungs and puff out your chest. lol
25:51 that validation
safety matches aren't strike-anywhere matches, they are ignited by a chemical in the striker strip. strike-anywhere matches don't really exist anymore.
I remember loving troom troom it was my favourite
It was funny when the duct tape was working as intended and they were losing their minds about it lol It’s made to be sturdy but also to be easy to rip without tools, that’s what makes it perfect for packing, you don’t need to have a cutting tool on hand since you can easily use the right technique and rip it so you don’t need to lose a sharp object just to pack up a bunch of stuff lol
I just noticed that on the box its supposed to be mortal kombat but the names for the characters are Raidan and Lu Kan. Not Raiden and Liu Kang, Raidan and Lu Kan, I get they're from another country but google exists
Danny I really like your vids, pls don’t start liking minors 💀🙏
That tape wrist thing supposedly works with zip ties as well, but nick is right if you're getting kidnapped by someone they're just gonna restrain you to the point you wouldnt be able to do any of these
31:15 Micheal jackson?
The reason you can break the duct tape is because you’re using your body as a wedge, there is even a 511 ad that explains it better
8:08  this was so confusing
Danny not understanding how stretchy fabrics work during the crafting segment is one of my favorite parts of the video
okayt you might laugh, but I bet when your parents took you to your first day in kindergarten, you didn't think to escape your captors by getting out of the car..........
How to kidnap: set up a box trap. 🪤 Next, this will obviously distract your target and make them take selfies. Don't trap them in the box trap. Instead, jump out and grab them!
4:39 I quote this DAILY
8:08 what the hell happened here
Would've been easier to just pop the trunk from the inside. Cars have latches in the trunk to keep you from getting stuck inside.
You messed up the rope one with the chair but you still escaped
"GIVE ME YOURSELF!"
8:07 HOW ON PIXELS SAKE
Plot twist : the life hacks are about how to kidnap people💀💀💀
The "aa he's back" really got me 🤣
27:50 That's actually (roughly) how you're supposed to get out of zip ties, duct tape, etc. on your wrists. Use your body as a wedge to force your arms apart.
4:40 we gon ignore the 2 guns????
“And in your head thingy” 27:23
"Are you talking about a gun? Like this?" "Aa, he's back." Is still one of the funniest bits I've heard you do. How unconcerned you sound when 'the criminal' comes back really makes it.
forget Beauty and the Beast, this is stockholm syndrome
I’m so serious, what is the reasoning for making these videos? Are they fetish content? Are they meant for kids so they farm ad revenue?
C R U S H T H E M
there's something 100x better than these life hacks it's called krav maga
Maybe she was bored in the dungeon because she's a Zelda fan and was hoping for some intricate puzzles
At 22:20 I breathed in while tensing my muscles while on the toilet and right when I tensed up I ripped a fat one
I thought this was gonna be a hack for the kidnappers. What a waste of time
Why do you look like 16 and 32 simultaneously 😭
So if you didn’t know arrivederci means until we meet again to arrivederci losers means until we meet again losers
Now if i'm ever part of the 0.00001% of people who ever get kidnapped i'll know exactly what to do if my kidnappers happen to tie me up with tape and leave my hands in front of me, thanks Danny!
CRUSH HIM!!
Gotta use the Bittenbinder method
8:07 am I going crazy or did you see that too
watching danny shittily diy a sheisty was not on my bucket list for, well, ever
I do not think that kidnappers use zipties as handcuffs- also, WHERE IS THE LOCK?
looked away to do something then heard my name said in a high pitch voice in my ear. *horrifying.*        (my name is skylar)
these kidnappers remind me of harry and marv from home alone, but if they wanted a tv so bad theyd kidnap some random girl for it, and their collective iq of 3 was divided by like 100
Can we try that with to layers of duct tape… I’m mean scotch tape?
I like how they used a hand, and tried to pretend it was a foot 3:33
i thought you said not for free danny ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️ (this is all a joke i find thhis funny but ill change it if you want)
11:25 it works with cable ties 18:36 geez calm down dude its just foot 21:50 emmm, but you should take air into your chest to make it bigger, not into your cheeks... you push your chest out and breathe normally through your diaphragm xd
that narrators voice is so fucking annoying
6:13 theyre just sons of guns ;v;
Watching two guys freak out over using physics to break tape is comedy gold.
they fr said  "play with matches"
Funny how it could possibly become useful nowadays because troom troom are from Ukraine and here we are in a middle of war so people really get kidnapped tortured and mordered, and ruzians are obviously too uneducated to know English, so if the hacks would work at least for some sort someone’s life would be saved and they would be able to cross the military border because when ruzians would check their phone history (they do that) a kid or a person would not be compromented
Skotch means tape in Russian lol, they're so cancelled
11:51 yeah..😕
How to escape Kidnappers: give them what they want (80” LED TV).
I love how sarcastic Danny is in this, this is my favorite video from him.
7:18 and 9:12 22:31
The scariest thing in that video was the narrators voice
That narrator in the troom troom video was so fucking annoying!! Bro I had to lower my audio when the video comes on
4:42 I laughed so hard at 😂😂
I'm just laughing 🤣 the entire video cuz this whole video is funny I just can't 😂😂😂😂😂
13:01  oh oh I’m so scared shiver my timbers
Did you wear the green frog shirt because you were worried about Nick's deficit
i do these things often, it all works each time 100%.
That narrators voice is SO HIGH
I just got a ad with that hide the pain stock photo guy
15:04 Danny Circumcision Tutorial, for my fellow freaks
that would actually be so funny if they actually invited that guy over
Chigaco shirt
Skyler has Stockholm syndrome
1:25 Why is the victim so *thicc* 💀 💀
Wtf are those socks
The amount of voice cracks the narrator has is insane
“There’s so many criminals” The “criminal” a gun: I kept lmao to that
THERES CRIMINALS E V E R Y W H E R E
soon as the epic part of the duck tape was happening my volume just so happened to for some reason turn all the way up
I kinda wanna see Danny react to the new stuff on troom troom now bc....it's so........uhm....youtube "kids" type stuff like Elsa x spiderman stuff....
13:54 Danny exposing all of you
This comment has been edited. Now it has*
9:11 I swear I’ve heard Kurtis use this? Has he? Couldn’t find any evidence
Two grown men just learned how duct tape works 😭 I love you danny
19:47 thats what she said
I thought this was a “how to kidnap”
My favorite part about the scarf one is that it banks entirely on someone planning on strangling you within their own car, and then not bringing anything to strangle you with, and also requires you to be wearing a scarf incorrectly
i hear some the sims 3 cas music here
3:33 WHY DO THOSE SOCKS HAVE TOE THINGS
Not gonna lie I literally thought that the first video was titled I was killed/survival hacks that may save your life. I know… I’m partially deaf. 😂 Don’t judge me please. 😅
Keep up the good work drew gooden!
Why Greg
Notice how he didn’t say I wouldn’t he said I wouldn’t for free
The scarf bit makes me cry laugh every time
I hate weeding
The fact that someone saw a comedically cartoony box and string trap and started filming it is shocking realistic
10:18 AYO- OUT OF CONTEXT THAT STATEMENT IS CRAZYYYY-
Yes Danny snapping peoples necks does tend to kill them 😭😭😂
11:13  Are you tied up with (duct) tape? *PERFECT!*
9:06 The Famed Arrivaderchi Losers Moment
“Gimme- your- self, I guess. I’m a kidnapper not a robber. Gimme your- get- get- get in the car!!”  Shiver me timbers 🤯 12:39
17:12 what DOES that mean?😭
I’m being kidnapped  They said calmly
When I first read the title, I thought it meant, "How to kidnap somebody" 🤣
actual kidnapping advice: pretend to gain stockholms syndrome so your kidnapper can trust you, and then manipulate him into trusting you with his phone, then you can call for help
Should we kidnap Danny now? I mean he already trained for it…
We all need a friend to tie us up
the narrator's voice makes me wanna rip my ears out
19:36 DnB!!!
this was actually my first danny vid
Arrivederci means bye in Italian
25:00 I can’t stop laughing at this even after rewatching it for 18 times😭😭
You'll be great friends with flamingo. Does that kill people? Yes, it does. Yes, a kind of does the chances of you surviving? That is like very slim. But how the heck is. This term to a man we can survive that But how the heck is.  This term to a man, we can survive that.
10:11 WATCH THIS IN .25 SPEED😭😭
The way she literally smiled…. 4:43     Edit: i like my own comment
Sims 3 music had me thinking my game was running minimized 😂
3:46 Dunno how he didn't notice but in the next shot she literally has shoes on
Danny's room looks awfully bright white today
love how this video has exactly 420k likes
11:55 if you aren't wearing the scarf..... CRUSH THEM with the seat and run 😂
11:37 i learnt this from project mc² actually, it happens bc although the duct tape is strong all together, the individual layers are very weak so your basically just pulling on its weak spot
3:09 is no normal gonna talk abt her sock cuz ummmm yea…
25:42 yeah because you were had me dying
“No that’s scotch tape” killed me ☠️
While Danny’s all concerned about how Troom Troom might be kidnappers, I’m more worried about why there’s a naked woman mannequin in the background of the shot at 9:08 and why it’s waist isn’t fully attached. Could someone explain this?
9:07 I’ve watched this multiple times and never noticed the random cursed mannequin in the background..
is it just me or does danny look like kickass with the skii mask
:3>
This is the video Arab should’ve have watched to escape
Doiiiiii 😂😂😂
as a person who wears a hijab, i see this as an absolute win
I CANT BREATHE 😂😂
7:27 i believe thats called stockholm syndrome
That’s the best way to be!
That’s why you tie the hands behind the back
I relate to the guy who said something that didn't make sense way too much.
12:40 umm.... "more authentic"??? danny.... are you a criminal???
"I had to cut the tip off!" Quote Danny Gonzalez
8:13 Yes, run deeper into the woods and away from civilization to make absolute SURE that no one will hear you scream. Great lifehack!
11:24 the fact that this is a working 'hack' but troom troom explains it so badly that you probably won't be able to do it right.  EDIT: HE DID IT
3:08 THE SOCKS.
Jesus bro this video is so funny literally lost my breath, have asthma and had to go to the ER
As that kidnapper, I can confirm that I am dead.
1:13 Silly you Danny, those are obviously for ventilation
Well at least they kidnap the fat girl
5:36 AH he back
You can definitely tell by his barrel that he was up to no good!
ARE YOU GETTING STRANGLED? Yeah. =(
My phone just fell in the trash can mid video 😭
12:12 "I've got a couple things to craft before my big day tomorrow! It's currently 11PM." Me for every high school project.
I'm sorry, on the duct tape one - why not just chew it off? Oh your mouth is duct tape? Tongue it off. Move your lips a bunch and then tongue that shit off. Haven't you ever had duct tape on your mouth before? It comes right off.
I think that scarf move would work even if they've got you with a garrote (just be ready to fuck up your hands) - but only the part where you sit the seat back. Put your hand between the garrote and your neck, push the seat back, which will briefly make room around your neck and slip out as best you can. Not sure if their pulling will make that moot but it's worth a shot, I guess.  25:10 Okay, nope not with a car that slowly adjust the seat like that. Which is most cars nowadays soooo...
Just started the video and I gotta say, there's an episode of Psych (great show, everyone should watch) that does a better job of this.
anyone know the song during the ad read?
13:26 Griffith!!
Can we talk about how the guy who delivers the tv talks??
……the fact that I watched this and knew the troom troom video 💀
most matches tend to be safety matches (you can only strike them on the box) so maybe that was the problem with the wall
The duct tape and making your body as big as poissble while getting tied something are tips I have heard from actual experts. I don't believe troom troom had these ideas themselves lol
song at 19:43 ??
It’s a game
Danny made a Gungungeon reference
23:29 arrivederci is goodbye in italian
Why is the narrator Mickey Mouse?
Not the naked manikin in the second video💀 9:08
And what if the kidnappers have a 9mm
9:10 why italian?
“I felt like I was choking you for a while there.” “Yea you were.” **Next life hack**
For some reason I thought the title of this video meant he was gonna try ways to kidnap people
danny: so it says i’m supposed to crush you nick: *moves out of the way as danny’s chair slowly goes backward*
nick’s inspirational speech to help danny get the duct tape off
Troom Troom is so clearly fetish content its insane
9:09 Bruv just screamed "bye" in Italian before she ran away lmao
for a second i thought the title meant tips on how to kidnap people
0:22 this feels like a cry for help
Yeah
Danny really made a kidnapper mask instead of buying a ski mask or balaclava. I respect the dedication
Anyone else notice the kidnapper sniff the chains when tying the 2nd girl?
ggrreeggggg😎
13:36 ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠
not the troom troom girl at the beginning getting pulled into the void
10:03 is the best thing ever
the bye at the end lol
7:11 I thought she was flipping them off 🫥
danny casually busting through duct tape multiple times is so funny lmao
Troom Troom is either the most genious satire ever created or made by the dumbest person alive. There is no inbetween
when a human neck breaks it could damage the windpipe/ esophagus/brain stem/spinal cord, which are all necessary body parts for humans
She wasnt even tied up. Its like taking off your seatbelt on a car while its still buckled.
Why would they use zip ties bruh
LOLL 😭🙏   anyways here is a recipe to the perfect steak, credits to recipes.co.nez: Take the meat out of the fridge 30-40 minutes before cooking. This allows it to come to room temperature and ensures even cooking. Salt your steaks. We recommend using kosher salt since its larger, flaky crystals make it easy to pinch and control how much you use. For the most flavorful and tender results, salt your steaks at least 40 minutes before or even the night before you plan to cook them. This takes a little planning, but “dry brining” your steaks, will not only season the beef, but help them to retain moisture for a juicy, tender bite. Dry the steaks and leave the fat on. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels for that perfect outer crust. If you want to cut the fat off the steak, do it once it’s cooked as fat adds flavour and moisture to the meat while it’s cooking. Don't add oil to the pan. Instead, brush the steaks with oil and season all over with a little salt and pepper. It's all about the sizzle. Preheat a large frying pan (or BBQ) to a high heat. If using a frying pan, the heavier the base, the better – heavy-based pans hold heat longer and cook the meat evenly. It’s important not to overcrowd the pan or BBQ, or the meat will stew rather than sear. Cook the steak in batches or use two pans if need be. You should hear a big sizzle when the steak hits the pan – no sizzle means the pan isn’t hot enough. The Two-Zone Method. The key to grilling thick-cut steaks is a two-zone fire. Set up your grill to have one hot zone and one cool zone. This can be done by turning on half of your burners or putting the coals just on one side of your grill. The side without burners or coals underneath it is where the steaks will begin. This lower, indirect heat will help raise the internal temperature so when you transfer it to the hot side of the grill you can sear it quickly and not end up with charred meat that is still raw inside. The timing. As a rule of thumb (for a steak 22mm thick) – cook 2 minutes each side for rare, 3-4 mins each side for medium-rare and 4-6 mins each side for medium. For well done, cook for 2-4 minutes each side, then turn the heat down and cook for another 4-6 minutes. To test for doneness, use the tip of your clean index finger (or tongs) to gently prod the steak. If the steak is soft and squishy, it’s rare. If it’s soft but a bit springy, that’s medium-rare. If it’s springy, that’s medium. Any firmer than that and it’s on its way to well done. Allow the steaks to rest. Place the steaks onto a wooden board or plate, cover loosely with foil and rest for about 6-7 minutes before slicing across the grain or serving. Resting will allow the meat to relax, and the juices will return to the meat fibres. This means the juices won’t run out on to the plate when you cut the steak – and results in more tender steak. You're welcome 🤗😅

I'm not Greg....
“and then you CRUSH THEM🗣️🔥🔥‼️‼️”
I hate troom boom
Thats the gayest walk I've ever seen.
The look.
The fact there are 3 people watching Danny get strangled LMAO
9:25: “Did someone commit a felony by the name of kidnapping? Show him you can do better by committing a felony named murder!”
So instead of getting the gun on the damn wall she just wrapped herself in a fucking blanket
Let’s together kidnap
TBH Kinda Cring
i can’t watch these videos not because they’re cringe but the narrators voice drives me to insanity
Why did the narrator in the first video sound like a knock off micky mouse and its making me want to rip my ears off
I never thought that I would see the combination of 5-minute crafts and the Elsagate people.
Undertale be like:
Let's take a moment to salute this soldier who sacrificed his sanity to make this video.
12:54 he do be looking like Griffith tho
10:12 C R U S H  H I M
29:22 flamingo music
When I was small, my best friend and I invented this life hack. When you sleep at night, you should always lay down in your bed the wrong way around (feet to head side). This way someone who wants to cut off your head will only cut off your feet xD
realistically speaking, I can't remember a single real life kidnapping incident that involved a fat chick
step 1 falls flat if the kidnappers actually lock the damn door lol
"How to survive being kidnapped:"  Have Liam Neeson as your dad
The Duck tape trick does work, but Troom Troom explained it wrong. first you have to put your elbows together. I think that’s what they meant by “Strain yourself”. Then, you don’t just swing your arms up and down. You’re going to keep them straight the entire time  and then bring them down really fast. Like I said, don’t swing your arms at all. Just up and down. If you hinge your arms out, then it won’t create the right tension.
7:30  stolckholm syndrome at its finest
smells like walmart in heeeeere
21:46
8:35 are we just going to ignore the background?
Goodbye is what arrivederci means I tried duo lingo last night in Italian so yeah
i felt like i was choking you for awhile....   danny: yea....yea you did   the sheer panic in his eyes and how his head snapped back even tho that velcro was there that...that is a man dedicated to his job
c=
im a gun >:3
I hate that voice. Fuck
can u put a trigger warning for the choking parts?
3:32 fetish content???
Where’s nicks TV or PS4? Kinda feels like you didn’t REALLY follow the video, Danny…
The Narrator got me in a mental hospital
the crafting section had me literally laughing out loud 🤣
9:53 DONT LOOK ITS A JUMPSCARE
What did you learn today?     Criminals are guns
you need strike anywhere matches for the match trick to work  you're a magician danny so I feel like you probably used those in the interest of fairness
Arrivederci is bye in Italian
9:08 THERES A NAKED LADY😭
10:10 I have no words and that is literally me and my friends
them being amazed that duct tape is that easy to tear shows how little knowledge they have of trade skills. I just know they use scissors to cut duct tape XD
13:35 that's what she said
9:07 WTF IS THAT ON THE LEFT
The first is stupid because,  Number 1. Most kidnappers don’t have handcuffs   Number 2. those are not handcuffs, those are zip-ties, zip-ties are made of plastic which can burn, normal handcuffs are made of metal, metal cannot burn.
If you snap a human’s neck they would die or they are paralyzed from neck below
nice sims 3 'create a sim' background music nerd. lol owned.
"You know what. I don't like basketball anymore. I like space." LOL
I love how they’re so surprised to find out that duct tape is not that strong
The democrats want criminal control, while the Republicans want criminal right.
Why does the thumbnail use Weezer blue?
Blud looks like Griffith
31:15 why does it look like Danny peed his pants?
Yeah, uh... don't try to bind someone with duct tape. It's purposely breakable. That's a feature, not a flaw.
the alexa moment never fails to make me at least giggle out loud. i have no idea why there aren’t more comments about that
This girl had instant Stockholm syndrome
He looks so much like lil mabu
“Are you tied up with scotch tape? Perfect!” gets me every damn time 🤣
i got a criminal in my rari, ay 17 shots no .38 i got a criminal in my rari 17 shots no .38
Ducktape is made in a way where you can tear it.  Apparently.  I have trouble tearing Ducktape.
u are so funny i love u sm
6:27 I believe you mean criminals
Danny the chipmunk cheeks makes it harder to hold your breath in, just hold your breath.
7:15 I just love how distressed Danny looks.
“wE sHoUlDn’T hAvE hAnDcUfFeD hEr!” YA THINK?!
29:29 what is this song?
HELP THE SOCKS??? 3:09
2:21 me, inserting an Andrew Tate joke here.
1:46 Ross Geller would...
Nobody:  Skylar: S T O C K H O L M S Y N D R O M E
DANNYS FACE HELP MEE 7:18
I like your frog shirt
I think "arrivederci losers!" Needs to be my senior quote
Nick is a reptile: CONFIRMED
“Alright well that- *literally dies*”
Danny and kurtis should fight
7:33 No...... they don’t! They also don’t know what a pretty girl looks like either. That’s obviously because they called her pretty. 🤢🤮
I saw the title and I thought “Is this how to kidnap people”?
0:04  yes, i am😁
one of your funniest videos 😂

I Love Danny Gonzalez Videos 💟
7:50 wait the car has the troom troom logo on the front  What are y’all tryina tell us troom troom? 🤨
The idea of kidnappers using plastic wrap as handcuffs is so funny to me, like you couldn’t get your hands on anything even a little more effective?
Someone should kidnap these Troom Troom guys.
Troom troom used strike everywhere matches
4:36 hoho hoho
i love waterboardimg
She’s not gonna use the guns or the chains you mean she’s not gonna use the criminals
Strike anywhere matches Danny
Troom troom and 5 minute crafts and other channels like that are kink content so thats why they usually dont work they often show feet and other common kinks everyone acts stupid in them and they usually feature little girls voices which is extremely gross but true
Why didn't you just buy a balaclava?
With the hack where you break duct tape on your wrists, you can actually do that with zip ties too it just hurts worse. You have to tighten them as much as possible with your teeth before slamming both wrists down on your knee cap. I learned this from a Netflix movie then tested it myself out of curiosity, it hurts!
"Kidnapping tips" feels more like tips for kidnapping someone rather than escaping
Duct Tape is a brand. Scotch Tape is also a brand. Duct Tape is actually called scotch tape and Scotch Tape is just clear tape.. it’s because of the brand names that people get confused. It’s like Howe in Britain they call vacuum cleaners a “Hoover”
"Quick! Quick! Throw her in the trunk!"
Ho hoo, ho hoo, ho ho ho hooo, ho oh ho hoooooooo
kidnapping someone is like A LOT more serious of a crime than stealing a tv. Why tf didn’t they just steal a tv
In the second hack THERE WAS A WINDOW IN THE BACK
You are the best
TroomTroom- ARE YOU GETTING STRANGLED???? Danny - ...yeah:(
i show3d my sister the troom troom hacks and shes missing now, thanks troom😊
did you that during the first life hack when the girl was holding up the match to show us, if you look closely you can see that the foot is actually a hand wearing gloves while holding up the match 3:30
For the duck tap one, you’re supposed use zip ties and slam your hands on your knees
to kill some one by snapping there neck you have to apply the same amount of pressure to there neck that they way 9:44
so sad Nick changed after this I miss the old kinder nick nd now he’s mocking ppls dead friends
Help me a few guns are running after me 😭😭
omg I cant... this sims music in the background :, D
What if the kidnapper brought their own scarf
Not exactly even "eyed" say
We need more nick vids
If you have a determined kidnapper he won’t just duct tape your hands with a couple of layers itl be about 5-6 layers which makes it impossible for anyone to do the downward manoeuvre and successfully tear the tape due to the amount of tape used,,the female looks like it may have only been a layer of tape for her to be able t9 easily break that tape …so those hacks are total”Achm( cough)” shite…. They’ve, probably watched a trained professional video concerning these hacks and weakened them a lot to make them look plausible …but who actually goes out wearing a material grip tape scarf deliberately every day just in case they feel they might be important enough for anyone to a kidnap them ???.?. Lmao
these two talking makes me feel like I'm at a playground when I was little and were playing a game help
When you find out duct tape is perforated
Arrivederci is good bye in Italian but troom troom was saying it wrong so you saying it wrong isnt that bad but you keep saying it and i cant stop laughing
the matches have to be strike anywhere matches
the one about grabbing their chin doesnt work if they are proper kidnappers they would just tighten the choke hold and you would be knocked out in seconds
" im being kidnapped 😊"
You are so funny with the troom troom series you make me and my siblings laughing.😅
Troom Troom: Are you getting strangled? Danny: Yeah.
10:18 poor choice of words
"and im not gonna expose my feet for *FREE* for you physcos" WHAT DO YOu MEAN DANnY?!
My dad was is a cop and when I was smaller he taught me the duck tape trick
if anyone was curious arrivederci means "until we meet again"
24:60
Hi
6:38 these guys have a Ps5 controller? Ain't no way they don't have a TV. They just wanted to kidnap someone.
28:10 the duct tape tears easily along one axis to make using it easier.
14:55 😂😂😂😂 it’s sealed, you have to clip off the tip.
so no one is talking about the doll at 8:30 ????
15:56 this clip did not age well after all of that happened.
Why does the female voice sound like Katelyn from Evan & Katelyn
The narrator of Troom Troom actually irks me.. Her voice is so high-pitched and it’s scratches my nerves to a point of hatred. I actually almost didn’t complete the video because of her obnoxious voice.
The door set up at 1:20 is actually fairly similar to some simple bird traps used in the medieval and early modern period. But they weren’t like, very good, and this woman is (patently) not a bird so… What’s the story there? “Hmm, how do we make the biggest, most obvious, and most overtly suspicious trap (not to mention useless) in existence?”
Her socks at 3:09 are just why
Man those criminals look really scary
Girl thought oh here’s a giant trap ok let take a pic🤣
Mortal kombat reference
Ok the woman that like does the voiceover sounds like that girl at school
i love the reverse stockholm syndrome thing in the first video it's so weird
If you’re gonna use chains to tie someone at least make sure they’re not extremely loose already like the ones in the troom troom video
Who tf is greg?
he just did it wrong first time
the wrist thing actually works
this is one of my fav vids
As a competitive martial artist and instructor I can say with complete confidence that would do absolutely nothing and it definitely wouldn’t snap a neck😅😂
Uhhh, so I sped up the sponsorship by 2x speed, and all I saw at the end was a very quick second of you falling to your death at the end lol
"I'm being kidnapped! :D"
aRe YoU TiEd Up WiTh ScOtCh TaPe? GoOd
This reminds me of 123 go but a whole lot worse
I read most of these in a book in high school we had to read about Hary Houdini
2:08 thank you, It feels nice to get some recognition for all the hard work we do.
5:36 The “ahh, he’s back!” Got me 😂
Does anyone know the background music 30:47?
missed opportunity to call kidnappers sons of a gun 🙏😔
8:07 what is that? 💀
6:26 Danny, she can't shoot guns, she can shoot criminals though
Is nobody gonna talk about the mannequin that’s literally butt booty naked
when nick starts genuinely choking him tf out  lmao it gets me everytime ksjdfkjsdf
"How much force I would have to put in throwing it back to crush someone"
8:28 actually yes
These video was made for Youtube kids? That's worst. 😂
HES USUNG THE SONG BACKGROUNDS OF @FLAMINGO WHAT????
danny: asks his friend to tie him up and then makes a weird face when he does
The narrator sounds like they have a voice crack
That thing about breathing in while you are being tied up is true. Horses like to do that when they are getting a saddle put on.
Who is this guy and why is he never on the channel again? Petition for danny to feature this random friend in another video
Omg I laughed way to hard at this
I never thought I wanted to see Danny's feet before but now I feel I'm missing out on something.
9:11 there's just a naked doll in the back
3:36 ain’t that her hand? Just wondering
16:02 aged like malk.
Not me walking in thinking troom troom would teach me how to kidnap people😅
As someone who's been hyperfixating on The Black Phone, I can't stop imagining the ghost kids giving this advice.
You can say that again
9:08 wait can we talk about the mannequin in the bg wtf
But like hands
Nick being in this aged like milk
Footfetishists : mission failed! We'll get them next time!
Watching the mask part, I get the reassuring impression that Danny is not a natural kidnapper.
4:53     LMAO WHAT WAS THAT OMG BAHAHAHAH
I Loved How Nick Was Pointing Out All of The Most Obvious,Easiest Ways to do Literally Everything
am I the only one who notices that the Rhino Shield sponsor background music is from Flamingo?
I think I’m ready to say, officially, that this is my favorite video Danny’s made. The way he delivers lines in the first half that aren’t technically jokes are funnier than most of the actual jokes.  “Just get out of the car” at 8:15 is a line that has no right being that funny. Only Danny could make that line funny because it’s such an easy layup to the point that it’s not really even a joke.  And I love Nick at 26:10.   I desperately want to know specifically which jokes in his videos are pre-written and which ones are on the fly. I think he said it’s like 70% scripted and 30% ad lib.  I need that 30%! Kinda surprised I haven’t seen any Gregs take a stab at making a compilation video of jokes they think are in that 30%. I think the comments section would be really fun.
Where is this being filmed?
The matches need to be strike anywhere matches
this video's gonna be a hard rewatch after learning about what nick's done, yeesh.
my worst mistake was having food and drinks while watching this
9:05 😐
Man i gotta thank troom troom these videos like literally saved my life im toooootaly not being sarcastic i was wearing my beatiful velcro scar when i got in my car and a person tried to strangle me so i broke my velcro scarf and SLAMED back in my SEAT!!!!!
I cant be the only one who thought of the jjba scene when they said ariverchi
why does danny look like riley from inside out at 13:32
what brand of mic do you have???
19:31 toe match game
The Troom Troom voice is killing me
I had already heard about the duck tape hack from the old show project mc squared but I didn’t think it actually worked
nick is related to benoftheweek
Danny is so autistic, I love him
5:01 my child watched this video and started crying from how many criminals there were how dare you not censor it
why does the narrator sounds like female Mickey Mouse???
She could eat the kidnappers☠️
11:50  "are u getting strangled?" "yeah🫤.."
I hate that these actually worked!
''Turns out even as babies they where still guns'' that got me
the voice makes me want to tear my ears off
If I ever get kidnapped , the last video I’ll ever watch will be this video
The voice over of troom troom does this aggravating voice, i cant handle it 🤡🤡🤡
i just want to say,, that the color of tht scarf looks so gorgeous on you. so chic ✨
15:57 Good job Nick!
I’m trying my best to watch this video but the narrators voice makes me want to rip my ears off
Not the type of kidnapping hacks I was looking for.
Who is watching this video after  the Rangers won the World Series?
Me, distracted: ...is that a Tesla Model 3?
You are the biggest nerd and i fucking love you 😂
Troom trooms title was correct, just not meant the way they intended. These tips will GET you kidnapped
9:08
25:24
"You wizard, How did you do that?" is a joke that gets stuck in my head a lot, his delivery of that line is so hilarious xD
“ are you getting strangled? “ “ yeah.. “ got me on the floor💀
You could’ve just bought a balaclava 😂 13:28
With how the narrator lady sounds I think this whole kidnapping video might actually be a hidden way to call for help
Who’s gonna tell him that fabric glue takes 24 hours to dry
The wink tho
I feel like I’m watching a video on escaping a fan fiction kidnapping.
Even the cheapest crappest duct tape can't tear like that. Haha
9:07 I’m sorry WHY DOES THE KIDNAPPERS HAVE A NAKED MANNEQUIN OF A GIRL IN THERE
When the fake kidnapper said “GOTCHA GIRLIE!” I paused eating my enchiladas and burst out laugh for absolutely no fucking reason
why is the troom troom’s video voiced by mickey mouse
And Russel Brand is “grooming” ? Fuck my life, rite..
i didn’t know this was nick
6:49 that cardboard tv fills me with so much rage
2 years after post
Stock home syndrome😂
11:12 "Are you tied up with scotch tape? ... Perfect!" -Troom Troom
this grown man is such a boy. it's so funny.
Arividaci losers
I feel like what I wanna do I would simply have shoes that have blades inside of them like how blitzø and Shinobu have There Shoes is like that
Kidnapping life hacks one to kidnap the other to escape a kidnapper 1 how to kidnap: take them out on a picnic in a deserted place and bring an assassin’s teapot’s with you ( a teapot with 2 chambers you can see how to use one on YouTube) have both chambers filled up with the same liquid except on has drugs and the other isn’t pour yours first (so there isn’t a drug residue on the spout) then purple there’s then kidnap them easily 2 how to escape a kidnapper: if your in a cell with bars after they go to sleep try to squeeze through the bars or pick the lock
9:34
dont✍use✍duct tape ✍when✍kidnapping✍
Bro it keeps on switching first to third person.
what is that weird video artifact
Fun fact:  If your kidnapper lets you see their face, they're not planning on letting you live
THE WINK 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Look at all those CRIMINALS” Danny points at guns.
“I’M bEiNg KiDnApPeD!”😊🥳😀
is anyone gonna talk about the girls foot at 3:09? HER SOCK IS SHAPED LIKE HER TOES LIKE WHAT
Bruh if you have the scarf on, when you lean back, you won’t be trapped anymore anyway!
Bruh. It’s so easy there with the zip ties. You don’t need a match, you literally just need shoelaces- which she had!!
i am a great greg
without the scarf they would grab your collar or neck u dont really wanna go running from kidnappers without ur neck and ur collar is way harder to detach from
Skibidi toilet is cringe
was this a glitch 8:08
I have not fallen out laughing like this in a while, you are truly Greg at holding your breath. 😂
Mickey Mouse wanna be: 0:41
Every time he said Arivaderchi I would laugh so hard because he's not only saying it wrong but also I have a broken sense of humor 😭
arrivederci, LOSERS
Arebaduchi
i completely lost it when you made your own ski mask, sorry but it was goddamn hilarious💀💀💀
"GIMME YOUR- GET-GET-GET IN THE CAR!" danny, 2021
As a horse person (equestrian) who uses duct tape (masking tape, in case Troom Troom reads this) very often at the barn and at home, the ripping life hack was not at all surprising. That being said, none of Troom Troom's hacks ever are. But the video sure was funny! Thanks Drew!
9:08 why is ther just a naked doll there
Nah, those faces he makes.😂
3:07 SHE HAD TOE SOCKS
I heard someone say channels like troomtroom and 5 min craft are like kink videos and I 100% believe that based on these videos 😓
Kidnapping lifehacks? More like, Troom troom: Stockholm Syndrome Lifehacks
the type of knot you'd tie you fukin square
egg 🍳
I use to watch these troom troom survival videos ritually, im not joking i used to watch kidnapping and zombie apocalypse ones 💀☠️💀☠️💀💀☠️☠️
if anybody didnt have the same reaction as danny when the girl gifted the captors a TV, you can call me your worst enemy, or even worse... a CRIMINAL 🔫
Oh no I've been kidnapped *start watching troom troom to escape
I remember chatting to a war correspondent before they went to Afghanistan. He received some real advice about being kidnapped; “it’s better to die on the streets”.
Respect meter;📈📉📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📉📉📉📉📉
I love how timid Danny is like during the RARARA Skit even though it was supposed to be him being savage but he Bearley moved
Did they use strike anywhere matches?
Yer mommeh sugs it all Noyte yer price
I’m gonna sub so I won’t miss more life hacks
21:14 i like how Danny’s doing the exact opposite of what he’s supposed to do here
No
is that a tesla?!?
Narrator sounds like mickey mouse
Neck snaps will kill or paralyze someone
In the part 2, the hack will be "If you're kidnapped and they put you in a giant lion cage, just die to materialize your ghost somewhere else! *woAw!* "
bruh at 25:20 I was eating noodles and I started laughing and I almost choked on them
am i the only one questioning why tf she was taking pictures of a random box on the sidewalk??
12:53 GRIFFITH!
The dungeon is just a pink bedroom
The duck tape part makes sense... But that's only if they use like 1 or 2 pieces of tape... and that's unlikely...
Cool tip for escaping kidnappers, if they put you in the trunk and your hands are (mostly) free.. all cars legally have to have a way open from inside. So you might be able to open it and jump out if your lucky. Edit: not cars their trunks.
16:00
The second one is every Wattpad fic ever only the kidnapper is Harry Styles or smth
The du- “scotch” tape hack is probably the most interesting because it exploits how it’s constructed, or something like that  Im not a engineer lmao
R/askreddit My goofy ahh kidnappers yelled at me, should I sue?
5:52  Son of a gun!
gotchya girlie!!!!!!!
You think those "actors" want to do these dumb hacks...? Ahaha! No.... Troom Troom seems suspicious with the way they always have new actors....
troom troom theiory they kidnap their actors and their like wanted criminals and thats why they have their lysinplate covered (idk how to spell lice N plate
25:30 I like how Drew closes the car door. It’s important even when being kidnapped that you follow proper car exiting safety
Casual Stockholm Syndrome
When she was in a chokehold and reached back I was surprised because I thought they were going to show her grabbing him and quickly throwing herself forward to throw him on the ground, a legitimate tactic that my brother in the army taught me, but I was NOT prepared to see her just- Snap his NECK-
I’m gonna  nut 0:21
sharply twisting someones neck like that would kill them instantly by severing the connection between their spine and brain  and yes it does kill someone
8:08 GIANT HAND GRABS ROBBERS (AT 3AM, COPS CALLED, NOT CLICKBAIT, GONE WRONG.) that's a video error, haha.
Im drinking milk
the mask reminds me of grrifith
I just realized in the first one with the matches, her legs were free, the dungeon door was unlocked, she could’ve just stood up and walked out lol
4:48 someone should tell Jerma Troom Troom is using his voice clips in their video and see his reaction
i hate them... its goofy ahhh
8:15 they could have made good advice if they mentioned how some- most? Trunks have a release mechanism on the interior. Or of ya kick out a tail light ya could get them pulled over.
9:45 - it can kill or paralyze at least, but it's nowhere near as easy as tv implies so it's not applicable anyway. I don't think there is anyone on Earth that is strong enough to break someone's neck in that position, while being thin enough to have a chokeable neck.
w
5:36 this is so funny to me
What does arigudishi mean
7:49 Illegal to be covering your plates like that.
what is the narrators voice HeY MaTiN!!
Nick just looks like he smells overwhelmingly of laundry detergent
Okay, because the government is definitely watching us, how does one of my favorite YouTubers video from a year ago randomly show up on my fyp doing a collab video with a channel I started watching yesterday 💀
imagine the kidnappers looking at those life hacks and trying it and then when they kidnap someone they're just one step ahead
7:04 is Martin having a seizure?
“Great job Martin, that’s a Felony!”
I haven't genuinely laughed like this in a while.
I’m upset no one’s talking about how offensive that toe sock part was 🤢
15:07 Doctors to baby boys
I love how excited Danny gets over the duct tape. It reminds me of that one time when I was 7 my sister tied me up with the tape in our garage and left me there to figure out how to escape because I ate her cookies!! Danny bringing back good memories <3
fun fact: all cars require a handle on the inside of the trunk so people can get out
being an actual greg makes me terrified every time these vbideos start
This is my favorite thing Danny’s ever said 21:54 that’s the type of nut you tie you ####### square
It's full of criminals
Lmao a weird Tuesday
I have to cut the TIP off. Dose that sound in the slightest way right?
Does the narrator in the first video sound like the animator Laddi or is that just me?
Toe socks were convenient
"...how much force I would need to put into throwing it back..." ---Danny-Gonzalez
Holy shit that duct tape one surprised me yo like same as danny i was so sure there was no way that would work
Nick kidnapped Danny for all the shit he pulled in the baddie SMP
12:27 looks like kanye put therrrrre
9:07 is that a s3x doll in the back 💀
Istg if I was kidnapped by the troom troom narrator I would give up on life
"ArE yOu gEtTiNG sTRaNGleD" how tf did that person put on the video
You know if Danny was ever kidnapped they would just let him go 😂
i love how the one i thought wasnt going to work was the one that worked best
"You can throw it back and crush him" 'Danny Gonzalez'
Imagine you get kidnapped and your kidnapper goes "gotcha girlie?" In the most 2000's Barbie ad voice you've ever heard
i thinks its hilarious that Danny makes  a joke that Nick didn't understand
T room groom is soon becoming advanced and civilized to the point of human extinction
The narrator 😭
why lol bro this is the funniest thing ever lol.
why lol
Why is no one talking about the LIFE SIZED NAKED BARBIE IN THE THE BACKGROUND?!💀 9:09
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE CHOKING PART WHEN HE WAS DOING THE MASK IM CRYINGGGGG 13:04
That first video's ending was like a Dhar Mann video
I love this duo
23:26 "arrivaderci" means "until we meet again" in Italian, for any of those wondering. But... Meet the kidnapper... Again..?
I don't know why but I despise the narrator's voice ._.
9:08 wtf is that doll doing there
i ahte thois
I think I'll stick to the Bittenbinder Method. Gotta throw the kidnapper off his rhythm.
So are we just gonna ignore the doll in 9:08
imagine if cops saw you doing this in public
I wouldn't be able to survive being kidnapped because I'd fall in love with my kidnapper immediately
24:44 Danny laughed as the life faded from his eyes
my alexa went off 😭😭
10:05 HER FACE I CANT WIDJSSIIWHE
“I’m going to be testing Troom-troom’s kidnapping hacks”  *puts on ski mask*
0:03 *are you getting strangled? 😃*
the fact that he spent money to rent a garage to do these stupid troom troom life hacks is crazy like just for stupid life hacks that probably won't save you
there was something similar on the part where you have to wear a scarf on tiktok where they use a rope or chain but you only move the chair down don't cut the rope or try to lift it off.
and now i have to crush his bones. seat moves slowly
yes im always happy when i get kidnapped and don't leave at all to get caught more times then give them stuff after they kidnapped me.
yes everytime i get kidnapped i always give the people who kidnapped me stuff
They even got survival matches I believe, which are supposed to be able to be struck on any surface
'Thats actually hilarious' meanwhile his face:😐
How to escape kidnappers  Step one: leave.
the scotch tape segment😭
18:59 LMAOAOAO
this is the first Danny video I ever watched.  Weird part is I used to not enjoy it but now it’s one of my favorite ❤️
Good job martin
The narrator sounds like Sharon from Braceface with a gun pointed at her head
The kidnappers are pedos in the first story
victim has Stockholm syndrome
I had no idea nick was that tall, he gives short energy😂
It's so weird how the narrator pronounces martin with a glottal stop
LMAO he activated my Alexa when he asked Alexa what the word meant 😭😭 23:38
Off brand Mickey Mouse narrating the kidnapping video is honestly the most unsettling part
Why do I feel like the photo with the masks was made to disguise the fact that nobody wants to work at their weird company and they only have like five actors in total
26:57  19:33
GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE, UHU I KILL PEOPLE, WITH GUNS  man, some yt classics here
IsNt iT RaCiSt tHaT ThE BlAcK GuY Is tHe cRiMiNal???     that was 100% sarcasim for anyone that requires more braincells
Bro put the life in page hack
Talk about a son of a gun.
bro, what were those socks 3:07
25:34 a wholesome moment between kidnapper and kidnapped ☺️
there are 2 kinds of matches, the "normal ones where u need the box to light them and different ones where the chemical or whatever is on the match so u can light it againt  almost any surface
When i read the title i thought it was life hacks on how TO kidnap someone That genuinely seems like something they’d do
WE             >:(        WANT       *TV*
The  beginning of the scotch tape one she said TIED UP WITH SCOTCH TAPE PERFECT!
The walls in this video triggred my memory of that one guy that cemented his head in a microwave
7:25 Stockholm syndrome ig 🤷‍♀️
I dont understand how troom troom can have such a large following with that god awful narrator voice
I’m being kippnaped😃
I tried the neck thing and I cracked my neck it made a pop sound 🫢
As someone who has been kidnapped by kidnappers using criminals I can say  when I escaped all I thought about was arrivederchi losers
0:40 Danny clearly doesn’t know the feeling of stubbing your toe stepping on a Lego or calling your teacher mom
darn! i shoulda watched these troom troom videos before i got kidnapped 5 years ago! Some proved to be very useful! Awesome video danny! 😂😂❤
I thought kidnappers taje kids not 30 year old woman
This is false advertisement I came in here thinking I would get life hacks on how to kidnap people
I watched this with my dad this morning (it was around maybe 1 am) and like maybe 5-15 minutes ago I was called because my grandma and dad wanted to know what I wanted for dinner after that was established I said "Welp, I'm not needed anymore, adios amigos" and my dad said "arriva durchie losers" and I just burst out laughing, and I declared to myself that I hate my laugh. 👍😬😁
Why are u so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They are developing Stockholm syndrome in there…
11:28, omg this totally works we looked at it once in my health class. But there is a chance you'll break your arms lol
Arrivederci is "until we meet again" in italian
Imagine being a kidnapper and the hostage is putting hair in their ears because they thought that it would somehow ease the pain because they saw a Facebook life hack
15k
Me and my son love your videos, we've watched this one a few times lol. We just wondered why you have a picture of yourself with an inhaler in the background lol. My son, Sammy and I really hope you reply, it would mean the world to him, and me lol x
I don’t know what company made it but my phone case has bolts holding it together
heres a hack! they only want to kidnap you for ransom or for your valuables, so make sure you have no friends, cut off all contact with your family and become poor! why would they kidnap you then? -troom troom
13:56 not ¨for free¨
@24:46 who does that mystery hand belong to? 😂
dy
Nick looks like kristopherson from fantastic Mr. Fox with that mask on
Ignore everything. Ignore the hacks, ignore the jokes, in fact, ignore danny. This bitch has toed socks.
The narrator person sounds like the kid from moral orel
i guess straining yourself works...
Did you know that groom groom is urkrainian
At 7:05 the delivery guys Shirt changes colors
10:17 me when i got that absolute dumpy truck
Ari va di chi
3:09  WE IGNORING HER SOCKS?? 💀💀
great job, martin. that's a felony
Are we not not going to talk about the door being open
Youre actually supposed to swing your taped hands from above your head into your abdomen as hard as you can and MAYBE rip the tape while DEFINITELY knocking the wind out of yourself. Most women can't do this successfully unless they work out regularly. I know I couldn't, my mom couldnt, most of my female coworkers probably couldn't, and my husband may be able to do it after a few tries. 😅 its not as easy as it looks and it will cause you pain, maybe even bruises, and might not even work.
8:36 (Sniff)
Push the seat back and CRUSH HIM
Push the seat back and CRUSH HIM
for 2 a real kidnapper will tighten up the damn chains for you ro not escape for 3 yknow how will the kidnapper know your wearing a scarf they will use a rope or something yknow
Danny the ski mask is part of them
I love how he doesn't know how to wear a scarf
Hoh ho
*“aribadurchi losers!😍😜”*
am I hearing the sims 3 CAS music?
The first one did not work would he help you. No he would not
3:33 they say to use toe socks so they can light the match with their hands while making it look like they’re using the sock. Look at the time stamp, that’s very clearly a hand
Honestly as someone who was kidnapped (yes it was a very traumatic experience) this made me laugh so hard, it’s just ridiculous. Btw I unfortunately wasn’t able to utilize any of these amazing life hacks when I was actually kidnapped, as I was 9 at the time and was scared out of my mind. But seriously this video was so fucking hilarious and it really improved my mood so thx Danny (and Nick)
Video synopsis: Danny tries these troom troom hacks while Nick offers a bit of logic to each situation 😂
Troom  Troom's voice drives me nuts.
9:06 ...was that a s*x toy?
I hate that the narrator of the video sounds like Mickey Mouse.
9:00 made me laugh when the chains are not even tight
IM LAUGHING SO HARD on the breath in while being tied part😭😭😭
it's so funny how nick just uses common sense and danny has to explain it each time
Why did that lady in the car crush him with such a straight face? It was terrifyingly graceful
what kind of kidnapper leaves the person that he kidnapped in a room that has two guns in it??? 5:05
Best video I've seen this week, hands down.
We almost had a foot reveal 😢
I love it when Nick and Danny do videos together
crime kin-
Duct tape really threw me off. Kudos. And the Alexa was kinda creepy.
the amount of times per day is "arrivederci losers!" is astronomical
You guys are hilarious. My day was a little bit boring till I seen this😂😂😂 Imagine if Danny actually passed out during the scarf kidnapping hack.
Wanna know why the last one works cause it’s not even their hack it’s a commonly known hack made by other people so don’t worry their still idiots.
This is not kidnapper life hacks this is so wrong a know self defense movements but that’s not real
Damn Martin u finna gonna get the jail time u deserve
yo susanna how you doin shawty
When he was talking to Alexa I was wearing headphones and my Alexa heard it
12:34 hitler
0:40
I just checked and Danny’s commentary had more views than the original. ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Why did the kidnapper sniff the chain at 8:36 😂
That common narrative voice is nails on the damn chalkboard 😩
you xan get out of a ziptie the same way as the duck tape.
5:09 -- 5:36 he had too much fun with this istg 😭😭
"Are you getting strangeled?" That one person watching while about to lose air curculation: "Uh-Huh!"
Boo! (starts to strangle the woman infront)
troom troom pls seek therapy
5.05 - when jewish babys are born
Okay but tell me why I feel like Danny is kinda good looking… bro isn’t even my type but bro still rizzable
I love you Danny, but Troom Troom’s narrator’s voice is making it impossible to get through this video
Considering that they are ruzzians probably means they're ACTUALLY serious with their advice...
7:56 your kidnapped? don't
Arrivederci means "see you later" in French (i think)
It means bye in Italian
26:42 no it was gayen yourself 🤦
3:08 so... Nobody's gonna talk about her sock...?
"I just had to cut the tip off." - Danny Gonzalez 2022
“I felt like I was choking you for a while there…” “Yeah, you were.”
the line "im gonna pull up to the shoot lookin like a hooved creature" kills me every time
7:05 did enybody know that the TV man's shirt canged
toenails🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
its full of criminals!
she said avadavici losers not arevadirci losers
This is one of my favorite videos
13:20
10:17 kinda sus
video is 1/10, i thought they would be life hacks to kidnap, not to stop kidnapping.
5:53
The real question here is, who in tf wears toe socks?
There not legally allowed to chase you
put the seat back to CRUSH HIM
QDDDFEWB
how much force to “throw it back to crush someone” 10:16
9:01 don't we all
I know how to save my life it's called a gun
3:08 WHY DOES HER SOCKS LOOK LIKE THAT ??? 💀
5:05  Oh no criminals
At 18:58 there are strike any where matches that would work
If someone went to me and kidnapped me and someone came to help me and says great job Martin i would be like why me
i went into a gun store there was all kinds of criminals
To be perfectly honest, without the annoying ass narrator, these videos would go great with goofy sfx and random gen Z humor.
Ni me abea enterado cuando comenzo el dia xd
The narrator is being held at gunpoint. Someone help her
pro tip if ur kid napped  untie your hands get out the trunk and tell them kidnapping is alegal so stop
11:48 they pronounced "arrivederci" so damn bad that they got my italian ass crying😭💀
Since troom troom gave us such a convenient way to get out of a car here’s a less convenient (more realistic) way to get out of the trunk of a car. If possible feel for the tail light of the car and kick it as hard as possible, if it pops out you can now see your surroundings, no hands necessary if they’re tied👍🏻
This "Skyler" character definitely has Stockholm syndrome.
Are we ignoring the “Are you tied up with scotch tape? Good!”
EXPOSE THE FEET
"Do you know how much force it takes tho throw it back hard enough to crush them?" -Danny Gonzales 2022
I was dying at you making toe socks and the picture that followed
Not him wearing the scarf like a dhupatta💀
I want to see feeet
29:28 im literally shaking buy him brown contacts please
When i watched this no joke i was DYING of laughter!!! Especially the part were you when "And if all else fails then try this! Kill them..." i was laughing so hard after that!
3:09 the sock toes💀💀💀
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
🤣🤣🤣🤣
It also helps to tense ur muscles when being tied up
I love the fact they have fake licensense plates
I read the title as "troom troom's kidnapping pranks" and I didn't even blink
how much money to see your toes?
The duct tape thing was on mythbusters I believe 100% works
Danny Gonzalez tomorrow is your 29th birthday
11th time rewatching
What are those socks 3:09
I have been kidnapped 5 times and 4 out of the 5 had matches laying around. That tip with the matches is great
ar·​ri·​ve·​der·​ci ˌär-ē-vā-ˈder-chē : till we meet again : goodbye - probs Italian. we love Google in this household
9:21 NEW THE LAST OF US PART III TEASER: THEY REVEALED ONE OF THE TAKEDOWNS.
I know this video is old but just in case you didn't know, duct tape is designed to rip easily and straight on seams to make it easy to use, which is why the duct tape hack works.   Any tape that doesn't have those seams it will not work with
oh that last one is like a legitimate escape method that I've seen from far more reputable sources than troom troom lmao
Does nobody else think this has to be satire? I feel like Troom Troom is just trolling the shit out of everyone but they're doing it so well that nobody realises they're being trolled.
thanks to these hacks, i now know how to kidnap so many people and no one will escape!!! Gotcha Girlie, or boyie i dont care.
As a former kidnapped person, can confirm this was accurate and exactly how I escaped
The tensing muscles and then relaxing to get out of ropes or chains actually does work.
Bro has a new superpower called Gregavision which tells you the nearest Alexa
bro could legit get the dimond play button with all these views
When i was ten i could do a really good troom troom voice
The best duo you could ask for tbh😂 I live for the troom troom videos and the “life hacks” of survival 😭
2:52 thats all I have to say.
15:02 the doctor cutting of my foreskin
The last hack makes them so confused and it's hilarious
Yes, breaking someone’s neck can kill them
i dont think that's a narrator she's voicing every single character in the video which is arguably worse
"His trigger was on the bottom half of his body" got me💀💀
Troom Troom is too hilarious
Fun fact! You are legally not allowed to do illegal things.
"Gotcha girly" Got me rolling on the ground💀
9:28 I have no clue what a snapped neck can do, but if it helps a kid attempted to snap mine and now my neck goes in a zigzag way and hurts at all hours, if that helps? I have not seen a docter yet and it seems to be getting worse, should i be concerned? 😅 Edit: idrk why i wanted to answer this, but my neck hurts worse some days than others and this is a day it doesnt hurt as much 😊
God that narrator is just awful.
My new fav line “it’s the kind of knot u would tie u fcking square” “Jesus”
25:33 beautiful friendship
The fact that there are two pistols sitting on the wall and she doesn’t use them.
this has no right to be this funny lmao
The thing I do not understand about this video is that these two people can't afford a TV but also have a PS5 and two fucking controllers for it. THEY CAN SPEND $575 ON A PS5 AND AN EXTRA CONTROLLER INSTEAD OF SAVING FOR A TV
I hate when I get killed by criminals!
i asked my alexa what aribaguchi was and she started talking about this youtuber that does ancient remedies and stuff
I think i know why this video has so many views
Ok I may have immediately tried the duct tape thing and I’m shocked it works so well! Wtf
Texas life hack: you are legally required to send any victims a letter detailing the crime(s) you plan to commit against them at least 24 hours in advance so if someone tries to kidnap you, just say, “Hey! Where’s my letter? That’s illegal!” And they are legally required to not commit the crime against you
8:54 this is how Harry hudini would escape from straight jackets
I think that these are just live action cartoons at this point.
10:18 gulp
13:37  that’s what she said
ARRIVEDERCI LOSERS 😈⁉
She is saying it wrong. It Arrivadichi means bye in Italian, and I am Italian and it is annoying when people say it wrong
Help. I’ve been kidnapped by troom troom. And I can’t do ANY of these hacks because they already know…… they taught me how to do this…..     HELP!
i just couldnt watch when they showed *gulp* criminals!
Why are there kidnap hacks 😦???
has Danny ever been cancelled before
Moral of the story: nobody can kidnap danny
the ski mask you made looks just like the ones from troom troom lol. also, i love your R2-D2 in the background.
Arrivederci means bye in Italian
As a kidnapper I can confirm I set down matches on the floor every time I kidnap someone
8:09  THE GLITCH
No😂
21:07 UGH HIS LITTLE WINK I LOVE IT
this is hilarious holy shit
love the sims 3 music in the background
3:07 NOT THE TOE SOCKS
9:19 I’m more dead than that guy💀
Okay, but the criminals are just POPPING OFF.                                                                                                                                                                      Troom troom;      *YES.*
but what if i like getting kidnapped 😩
Danny regretting all his life decisions when hever looked at the final product of his kidnapper mask.
Who the heck would want to kidnap her
Damn i hoped so much 13:57
im starting a narrator hate club
The toe socks were the worst part 😭
The first girl in the video, when she was picking up the matchs with her feet her socks were like gloves. Every toe was indivigually covered.
As someone who has been kidnapped... they do in fact say "gotchya girlie" if they don't than it isn't real.
4:48
Let me get these zip ties off my wrists so I can run!!
While I really want to celebrate the success of the duct tape move, I'm pretty sure there's a reason people bind your hands BEHIND your back...
My brother had to use the first hack when our dad tied him to a bed with zip-ties and he was able to get a lighter nearby so that one can work 👍
Is anyon else questioning the smooth jazz in the background
4:56 has to be the funniest thing I’ve seen all day 😭😭
We should go report troom troom's vids for "kidnapping" so they get taken down by youtube lol
11:25 oh thank you danny to survive i will just take off my doc martins and like guys
In case you were wondering why the matches weren't lighting when you strike them against a wall, it's because safety matches on light on the box (red/brown tips), but they used non safety ones (green/white)!
i dont get why he didnt believe the tape one lol. you can rip duct tape with your bare hands..
if I was kidnapped and the kidnapper was like "gotcha girlie" I would I would be like this: 👁️👄👁️
"And Im Definitely Not Gonna Sell My Feet Online *For Free* " YOU SELL FEET PICS??
The main reason these videos are so funny is because of how sarcastic he sounds
the robbers have the mindset of a younger and older brother
24:08 is hilarious. “There is rope inside that I can strangle you with” 😂 him with the mask and saying that is just hilarious. It just got kinky
14:21 my humour is broken I’ve been laughing at this for five whole minutes
Aahh he's back
Wait the end😂
Throw her in the trunk💀
17:32 Danny turns into a fly
Arrivederci is bye in italian so i think that might be what the girl was trying to say lmao 😭
Troom troom is dumb my sister used to watch it. I am a huge fan and I love ur vids
24:43 LMAAO DANNYS FACE WHEN HE REALIZES ITS ACTUALLY CHOKING HIM OUT
Stoppp 10:11 broo 😭
someone said to me they would try these hacks never heard of him since
james potter?
I thought when they said the kidnappers were brothers and pointed at the pictures I thought that one of the kidnappers was just a cross-dresser and the brothers had kids together for some reason I think the troom troom video is messing with my mind making me more stupid. I would not be surprised if it had that effect
Was the "arriverderci" f***ing jOjO rEfReNcE?
Y
In 2134, I bet children in Boy Scout/Girl Scouts would follow these tutorials and take it very seriously
Don't like your situation, JUST LEAVE
this is my favorite video
desserts and stressed are the opposite word
Why didn’t  she lift the box?😅
she has stockholm syndrome
HELP THE SECOND HAND EMBARRASSMENT WHENEVER THOSE GUYS ASKED YOU IF YOU WERE LIGHTING FIRE WORKS 💀
a boy is a gun
Did no one notice the weird mannequin          9:07
Why does the narrator of the video sound like mickey mouse
0:3 no legit this hurts my feelings I legit get strangled like evrey day at school becuase of my "friend"
damn, both Danny and Nick cute and fine af...i would marry them both
The troom troom videos are the type of videos that play when i fall asleep on my phone
the only thing i learned from this video is the word “duvet”
Can we just appreciate the coffee he puts in his daniel?
I'm italian and "arrivederci" means see u again
"arrivederci losers" jiojo reference
11:00 but they ll use their scarf then
I feel as though the narrator believes that the victim was kidnapped by Yes Theory
Note to self: kidnappers can't smell matches
nick is cool
9:23 that's not a life hack that's a fvcking murder technique
The reason you burnt yourself was because you had tension on the middle zip-tie and pulled one of the burning ends through the zip-tie on your wrist.
How do you not know what strike-anywhere matches are?
The narrator isn’t telling Kevin he’s smart that’s the other kidnapper saying that to kevin
Troom Troom videos are def A) a way to farm engagement/cash off anger-clicks & B) SFW fetish content. No way they aren't.
The new Troom Troom narrator is terrible and I hate it        I didn’t call her voice ‘it’, I called HER it.
huh-hough, huh-hough 🎅
"I feel like I was choking you for a while there." "Yeah, you were."
If you're drowning just swim out of the water bro
The people speak Russian so there is someone talking for them in English
The thing about breathing in and tensing your muscles actually works. Houdini did it in some of his tricks.
Fun Fact : There is supposedly 4,624,093 people who watched this video and didn't subscribe this answer is the closest to the real amount that I could get
I just realized that Danny has the same last name as my substitute teacher….
the reason the duct tape breaks so easily is because duct tape has sort of like a mesh inside of it holding it together (the reason you can rip it with your hands when you're tearing off a piece) so if you need to get out from being duct taped together it's not that difficult 😌👍 that's also why there's such a clean cut when he got out of it btw
you can just wear the scarf and just CRUSH THEMMMM!
4:39 ho HO ho *HO* 4:58 👆👆👆👆 5:15 police interrogation 🔫 9:15 ✨arrivederci✨ lOsErS 10:11 *CRUSH HIM* 10:47 *_CRUSH THEM_* 11:35 hiya! i’m FREE 12:40 gimme your- oh i’m a kidnapper 13:17 danny dying 14:18 danny’s big ass big toe 16:29 🔫 17:12 you got nice skin 17:32 aAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaH 19:02 it sounds like it’s working 😱 that’s what it sounds like when you scratch something!  20:29 should i invite him over here? 21:20 so what’s going on over there? 21:27 should i do a double? 🤨 you think i should do a double? 🤨 21:42 you okay? 21:53 what’s a square knot? 22:31 😒 22:51 kinda knot you would tie, you fucking square 23:27 alexa?! 24:23 kidnapper to lover story 24:43 danny struggling more than he thought he should 24:58 now i crush his bones 25:24 arrivederci loser! 26:56 you *dumbass!* 27:08 no 29:02 danny being so cool
This was the first video of danny's that i saw and it's the best intro to his content i could've gotten
It will 0
I always check my backseats before getting in the car
Not the family picture 😂😂😂
it's so hilarious that there just happened to be an alexa in this random garage😭
are you the actor in ratatoulie
while watching this i saw a cat pooping on my front yard
Danny using music from Sims 3 create a sim in the background at the beginning of the video is making me so happy
I'm starting to think instead of "gotcha girly," one of the kidnappers is saying, "Catch her girly"
7:08 To my Captors 😂
Wait until the robbers go broke paying for subscriptions and other stuff for the tv
Can we go back to being GEG’s???
By the way YouTubers take this so seriously no disrespect I get it this is a thing that's more doable to get your ideas out there and not have to depend on somebody to find you in other words you're opening your own doors which creates creative competition. Be grateful for the opportunities today focusing on that buildup don't break down that how to do that is still trying to be figured out. Whenever that day will ever happen.
I think the moral to the story is; Pay attention to your surroundings and be aware so you know who's near  So many kids walking home from school including my granddaughters glued to their phone become easy Pickens.  And if you do get kidnapped it goes from good meaning the attraction in order to lew you in  & Become a nightmare.  Maybe a kid's mind will see it that way I have no idea. But you are funny I watch what my teenage granddaughters watch LOL
"Gotchya girlie" NAH UH IM GONNA BE LAUGHIN- *dies* "HAHAAHAHHAHAAH"
i wanna hear that woman's real voice
This is one of my favorite Danny videos
The ultimate saw trap “you’ve been kidnapped besides you is a groom groom video
This is the first video I saw from you and I think it's really  good
At the start of the second video the robbers say quick brow her in the trunk
oi danny, you shouldmake a video on their 'zombie apocalypse lifehack series' or whatever it was.
10:18 I already put a lot of force into throwing it back
yall why is nobody talking about the socks at 3:10 its objectively the worst part of the video istg
The Batman we need.
If a kidnapper kidnaps me and talks like These kidnappers, I would ask them to shoot me right away
ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI ARI. i can’t be the only one thinking that
Matches will not strike on a surface other than the scratch pad thing on the box(forgot the name). There’s a chemical thing where the reaction isn’t complete with out the strike pad
I'm sorry, but if you were kidnapped, you would not even be treated like this. You would be threated and maybe hit along with other brutal stuff done to you and overall this might not even work because most kidnappers are very smart not like these two sh!t heads
I have to come back every once in a while to appreciate the square knot joke
God, the VO lady has such a terrible cadence to her readings. I’m not one to comment on the way women talk because I like to respect women, but Jesus absolute fucking Christ the way she pronounces “it” as “eht” makes me want to rip my hair out
Personally, i think the socks she was wearing are scarier than the actual robbers
Is it me or do toe socks look gross?
GREG
If you snap it bad enough snapping your neck can kill you
Im a kid and Im in the back so am I a badguy? Lol
Actually got some good advice out of it.  Annoy your kidnappers until they let you go or kill you and boom, no longer kidnapped.
i really thought nick was like 5'1 but no hes practically the same height as danny
Rude that danny didnt give nick a gaming pc and a full gaming setup and a mansion for kidnapping him. its like he didnt like being kidnapped
Calling guns griminals is like calling bullets magazines
hey I know it's been a year but I think there is something you might wanna check out about troom troom, that being the person who voices the channel might not be a person. I got an ad a while ago for a voice changer app called voice or something and in the ad IT HAD THE TROOM TROOM GIRL VOICE! literally the dude sounded EXACTLY like the voice over lady! maybe they used her voice as a base or maybe they've been using the app this entire time lmao
“if you have a box of matches, you can think of so many games!” ah yes, a great message to send to troom troom’s audience of children
i need more nick and danny collabs
please what brand is this sweatshirt/where did you get it i’ve been obsessed for weeks
arrivederci means "until we meet again" in french
Bro, just said I might’ve just died today but at least my phone was safe
My name has Gun in it does that mean im a criminal
My Alexa just turned on
GREAT JOB MARTIN
Arrivederci is Italian for farewell or goodbye
11:53
The narrator wasn't siding with the kidnappers-it was THEIR dialogue. As was fairly obvious by the way she says, "There's OUR victim.
Have not started the vid yet but I know it's going to be good due to the thumbnail
you should make videos on the youtube channel of *lisa gaming roblox*
nice going John you successfully killed her - Troom Troom's narrator
Danny the reason you were coughing when you did the handcuff hack was because you were inhaling dangerous chemicals 🤣
It’s not doo-VAY. It’s doov-ay
Why couldn’t she use her hands to pick up the match, light the match and melt the cable ties? Why did she have to use her feet?
4:58 bruuuh it hurts to laugh wtfffff
the "guns'had money to buy a ps5 controller and not a tv? awesome
All of the top comments are unhinged and I love that.
This girl really cant notice red flags
23:56 I never knew that someone wanted to get strangled so badly             Wait... That sounds weird
Tell everyone to unsubscribe to troomtroom
15:10 my christan parents when i was born
OK I feel like she had Stockholm syndrome come on
gotcha girly
When the first chick put her hand under the dudes chin and her other hand pulled his neck, it forces the person to go with it, it doesn't break their neck that easily
i didn't realize until now the music in the beginning is from the Sims when you're creating them xD i wanna say sims3
Nick is like the only sober person at the party
24:47 who’s hand is that?😬
7:16 I’m sorry, I’m sure this was a great video but truly I cannot stand to listen to that narrators voice for another second 😭
‘I did it perfectly wrong’ 😂
YOU ARE KIDNAPPED MUAHAHAHA by the way we still on for bowling on Wednesday?
3:32 why
the crafting corner light in the background and matching light was so cute
Omg- I paused on the perfect time and Danny looks so funny
Literally the funniest person ever 😂😂😂
I love how in all of his videos when he changes scenes he has a completely different microphone to use. His house is full of microphones of all types. Like there's no one type he likes the most. Subtle, but hysterical.
*Stockholm syndrome*
😂
I feel like the narrator lady either has a gun to her head or is doing it creepily intentionally
Hi Danny, Greg here, I've been a subscriber for years now and I thought today was the day that would finally pay off, but sadly, still no feet...  Da fk man....?
Wha .. ha wh ... Huh. Wha.. what huh
I'm surprised the trunk one wasn't hot box the drunk so when the kidnappers open it they get high and you can escape!
i ❤️ being kidnapped
7:25 stockholm syndrome!?!?
Amen
Then they would do something else to choke you, if you’re wearing a scarf, it would be useless to bring something to choke you. That’s why.
3:35 clearly just her hand in a sock
Me entering a police station lobby: THERE’S CRIMINALS EVERYWHERE  Police: Where sir!? Me: in this room.
I was watching this video a couple months ago and I fell asleep. I had a terrible nightmare where I was kidnapped and had to hide. I am being serious.
Actually no usually twistkng someones neck will not immediatle kill them
1:38 “Great job, Martin, you did it! That’s a felony!”
arrivederci means "until we meet again"
Power rangers acting ability
I learned the duct tape thing and the hold breath while being tied thing in a self defense class
The fact that the women was kidnapped, and yet she was so calm, and the fact that she was put in a room by herself with guns is just...   Like what the f
Arrivederci means goodbye in Italian
26:30 no élaboration needed
nice thumbnail
If you ever need a ski mask for trying these out you can always order a balaclava
bruh you look like if Lip from shameless had a good upbringing.
If you pause it perfectly you can see it that it's a hand inside of toe socks
You can’t light a match using the brick wall
Troom Troom's videos are just like modern Conservatives; "If you're homeless, just buy a house"
What if the kidnaper has a rope
is that a real gun danny? i wouldnt be surprised if u have a gun bc u seem like the type but i hate how troom troom looks like a girly girl
0:10 haha now I have the earliest comment in the timed section
That narrator is on par with the tiktok voice over on being absolutely annoying
He set off my Alexa.
What if this is made for  Kidnappers on what NOT to do...
I guess... the real kidnappers were... the friends we made along the way
not them romanticizing being kidnapped
i’ve never even been kidnapped and these are triggering
12:35 you look more like spiderman than a kidnapper
call me Kevin ......
This is pretty good comedy. I like this guy! Only like my third video I’ve seen of him he reminds me a lot of Conor! Much enjoyed!
Wtf is troom troom?
“gimme your get get get in the car” bars.   also nick being the most awkward kidnapper is so me. i could never be a felon.
This has strong early Lego game vibes.
I once undid a zip tie completely without breaking it. :l But seriously, if you get kidnapped and the kidnapper uses ZIP TIES, and then leaves you alone, scout out the area, make sure you're safe (well, as safe as a kidnapped person CAN be), plan out what you're going to do, and then CHEW through the zip ties. It's so easy! They're just plastic! And besides, on the off chance that the kidnapper leaves matches next to you, and the wall is the right texture, and your legs are long enough, and you're skilled/lucky AF, burning plastic produces noxious fumes that you do NOT want floating up your nose, so don't try that anyway.
Is no one going to talk about the real crime here 3:07 TOE SOCKS she deserved to be kidnapped
a reeve the dirt cheese, losers
That thumbnail and how you smile while being on fire 🔥😂
the first vid i watched from danny (i am greg) :)
The doubling down of the square not joke was golden
I finally figured out why they say you and drew look alike, I personally was like no they look nothing alike but then i closed my eyes and it was as if I was hearing drew, maybe a combo of tone of voice and style of video making but i'd have bet money this was drew if i hadnt seen your face first lol
@8:40 my mom’s childhood horse did this sometimes when they put his saddle on lol
Idk why I keep watching these commentary YouTubers unironically watching ironic comedy clips and taking it face value.
"GERG" (switch the letters for comments)
I worry for gen alpha
I mean, if you’re kidnapped and held for ransom, and somehow escape, and for some reason don’t then press charges, it would be a half-decent idea to get the thing they wanted so you don’t get kidnapped again maybe?
at 11:20 you can't be gay
Imagine not having a person that looks after you in your early years and you stumble upln one of these channels for genuine advice
They meant that the criminals were all around the house.
are we not going to talk abt how the narrator sounds like fucking MINNIE MOUSE??!?!!
All jokes aside, but at 3:09 , Why are her socks so stuck to her foot that you can see her toes.  Edit: And at 3:35  IS THAT HER FOOT OR HER HAND 💀
I cant imagine what Danny's youtube recommendations look like
Or you could just not get Kidnapped
You sound so much like the guy from team four star that does goku's voice
i thought nick was trying to trick danny into hurting himself buy elbowing himself in the belly really surprised it worked
The voiceover makes me want to cut my ears off
Props to Nick and the Cameraman
as a young woman, having a man pop up in my backseat is actually terrifying but it’s ok cause i don’t wear scarves
You know what...... f**k Troom  Troom
once again im used
Just check the back seat for people
A weird amount of these involve strangulation
Arrivederci is an italian word and it means "see you again/see you later" so he's basically just saying: see you later, hope you kidnap me again soon!
7:58, an actual useful version of this "tip" would've been to inform about the latch on the insides of modern trunks. The trunks on modern vehicles have a handle to the latch to get out of the trunk if someone closes it on you. Use that if you can
7:26 alright so this is what I learned Me a disgrace to society (wear toe socks) Get kidnapped by people who watch 5 minute crafts 24/7 Be stupid
I haven’t seen a Troom Troom video in quite a while. I didn’t think the narrator’s voice could get more annoying, but they managed it.
tape is called scotch(скотч) in russian, i was so confused when i moved from russia an went to school and it wasn't the same
Lamo I can't get over the fact she straight snaps that guys neck and calls it a self defense move
I hate the narrators voice so so much
Do you work with like young GenZ old Gen alpha? I’m not even in my 20s yet but I watched Steve on blues clues on top of that I watched the majority of movies in my childhood on VHS. My parents still have all their VHS and the player just incase they decided to try and set it up again
"Gimme your-! >:(... Self I guess?" I'm broken
Troom troom be like are u being strangled 😀
3:08 WHY DIDNT HE MENTION THE GRIPPERS
Arrividerci is good bye in Italiano
The chemistry between Nick and Danny during the scarf scene 💕
Keep strong. Don't forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.     Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans     . The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom.     If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. It's not about following the law - perfectly, as it's impossible - it's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction).     He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place.     He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.     He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way.     NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER    If you have any questions let me know
24:46 I CANT STOP LAUGHING LMFAO
0:22
6:50 lol the kidnappers are playing mortal kombat (sorry had to spot that out cause that is my favorite game)
Epek hack: js don't get kidnapped
Never heard of TroomTroom but it definitely seems like another channel copying off of “5-Minute Crafts” lol
Smells like Walmart in here
i like this nick fella. he is quite funny. for a kidnapper
4:25 Haha reverse Stockholm syndrome
Your all 9:11 9:16 23:16 23:21
got toe socks as a joke gift last year. i guess they’ll come in handy more than i thought…💀
The duck tape, sorry I mean scotch tape, one is an actual trick you can do. The reason why it didn’t work at first is because Troom Troom worded it oddly
i came here again to hear the "AREVIDERCHI LOSERS" one time and i cant even find it
Rrrrr
Is that the bonglord?
"Smells like walmart in hereeeeee !!" Walmart does have a very specific smell lmao💀
You can snap the zip-ties with that duct tape trick aswell. There's a reason why military / police personnel have very thicc zip-ties and they tie your hands behind your back. Though if you have your hands tied behind your back you can try using your ass as a wedge between your hands to break the tape / zip-tie in a same way you use your sides when your hands are bound on the front.
6:36 if they don’t have a tv what he playing on
Arrivaderci means "until we meet again" in spanish
The zip tie/ductape one is actually very dangerous, going and slamming your wrist can actually shatter your wrists AND not break it anyway, I got this information from Tom Coyne an anti-kiddnapping trainer (a person who teaches people how to get out of situations if they are kidnapped)
my brain keeps photoshopping wilbur soots face onto danny
The kidnappers just won't watch this vid
they're in russia. getting kidnapped is just a weird tuesday.
No one: Troom Troom: Use your local flex tape to stick yourself to tha floor!😳!😳!😳!
9:07 nobody taking about the naked manikin on the ground?
Why do kevin and Martin remind me of stan and mitch from road 96
I can't get over Danny's face when he's breathing in
My chest hurts - I'm laughing so hard at the homemade toe socks, I'm crying and choking
5:13 had me laughing so badly
Ah yes, the time I will get kidnapped by a cardboard box set up by girls pretending to be boys in black socks. And why would they have a film crew and having myself in zipper cuffs.
Can confirm that an Alexa is everywhere I asked Alexa something at a house I was staying at it was like where you rent a house and she responded and I had a good laugh with my brother 😂
Fun fact: When a tape is on your mask, you can just blow it off/spit on it. Tapes can’t be sealed when it’s on a hairy/Dence type of bodily skull structure
"You gotta cut the tip off" Oh no.. poor babies 😢
Actual kidnapping hack: If you’re stuck in a trunk, try kicking the tail lights out. You may have to use a lot of force, but once you succeed, you can yell for help or wave out the hole to get attention.
Regarding the scarf trick a good reason to wear this is because they could just choke you with their arms but if their some sort of psychopath they’ll probably try to choke you out more creatively via scarf and if you don’t have that scarf on you’ll just get choked out with their arms
9:08 are we not gonna talk about the random naked women?????
Complete random question lol but does anyone know the name of the music that plays in the background at 2:04 ? 😂
9:31 actually scared me a bit
#13:31 he looks like speedball
Funny
When they're trying to light the match they sound like middle schoolers
I think the narrator is actually just them trying to voice act
Heard someone say Troom Troom is just fetish content and I haven't been the same since. They're too correct
‘I’m being kidnapped ‘ moments before disaster 😢
arrivederci is italian means bye bruh
The girl at 11:51 is a baddie
The waffle house has found it’s new host
“The answer is a gun, and if that don’t work, use more gun.”   -Engineer
Me who trains on karate: *Time to see what h*ll i’m gonna watch*
4:00 Stockholm syndrome, i guess?
“mar’in”
The crazy thing is that there is a legitimate life hack for zip ties that doesn't involve strangely convenient matches. If you are wearing shoes then your laces can cause enough friction to melt the plastic.
I think that wearing toe socks at all is a war crime
Are we not gonna talk about how she have socks that have sectioned off spots for each toe! I know that it’s like really fake but actually have those socks 3:09
18:52 lets pretend like that didnt fall out of danny's toes.
when you snap somebody's neck you crack the bones in your back but higher up at the neck  and puncture their  spinal cord and yes YOU WILL DIE if you turn somebody's neck.
Are there any hacks on escaping that narrators voice?
I just like the intro
Can we please talk about how that sock has INDIVIDUAL TOES
"If you have a box of matches, you can play so many games!" 🚨🚨🚨 *This is the police. Why are you encouraging children to play with matches*
4:22 please tell me reverse stockholm is not a real thing also the exhale thing doesn't work, horses do it when being saddled and any decent kidnapper/horse girl will just knee you in the ribs and wind you
Oh for the match one, you might be able to use a candle or tea light
Guys this is the third time I'm watching this and I've haven't laughed so hard in so long. This is such a funny video, the editing is hilarious Keep up the great work Danny! 👍
"wait! please let me watch troom troom before you tie me up🥺"
I feel like this is an IASIP episode with Mac trying to make another Project Badass episode to show off how delusionally confident he is that he could survive a kidnapping and he’s forcing Charlie to be the kidnapper and Dennis is the one filming and tell him none of this shot would work
ARIVE DERUCHI  AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE
living for that sims 3 background music
3:45  this reminds me that a man escaped a high security prison by soup (which is actually a good thing bc he was innocent I think the video said I watched on it)
This is the funniest video you've mad e
No one noticed her disgusting socks?
Naw bro got the kidnapper rizz 16:21
Danny saying he won't show his feet for free suggests he'll do it if he's payed
Open the tape with your mouth 💀 27:12
Good job that's a felony 😂
Second time watching this and laughing so hard
Reminder that these craft jack videos are foot/hand fetish content.  If I have to know then so do you
“Cuz I’m definitely not showing my toes lol n camera for you creeps,” makes me crack up  Also, that ski mask is BeaUTIFUL 💜
If I'm a girl and I play gacha games...  am I a GACHA GIRLIE?
😂at 15:35 he literally looked like that kid from the Lorax😂
Aribaderchiey losers
GoTcHa GiRlY
such an underrated video
according to google translate the similish is actually Italian for "Until we meet again"
I’d like to point out the kidnappers would look a lot more menacing if they actually wore the ski masks properly
There’s a problem are you were talking about how I’m not wearing a scarf they wouldn’t be able to stand you not wearing the scarf would make it so that they would just strangle you by the your neck like I feel like it’s counterproductive 😅
3:09 why that girls socks got like compartments for her toes
Arrividerci losers!
Fyi "arrivederci" is an italian word and it means "se you later", wich is kinda concearning considering she's allegedly running away
i really need danny and nick to collab more cause this is easily one of danny’s funniest videos
Lol its hilarious how slowly the chair was going down
Ariavadochi loser 😂😂
Thats how they get actors for these, they kidnap them!
I was watching this and I realized Danny is wearing the shoes that my grandma always wears  18:34 lol I can’t believe it
6:44 the way he holds his controller is hard to watch.....
What are those socks in the second video!?
oops sorry wrong side of kidnapping
Chevy criminals don't like people not giving them what they want at the end so at the end of time and you don't give them one that was true for you today even if it's at the end of time
Loading screen hints are useful Loading screen hints:

Yo -look at 9:09. Troom Troom really be pushing the limits. That is one nasty mannequin on the ground. 🥲🫠

For the car. One having an electronic seat brummmmmmmmm wait it’ll crush you next year
9:41 yes
Was the tree frog shirt a hint that he would be visiting a Rainforest Cafe soon?
"Are you getting strangled?"Most out of pocket thing i have ever heard
Best way to survive a kidnapping is to not let me kidnap you.
Are you okay
troom troom doesn't understand how serious and dangerous kidnappings are. Like if you were kidnapped, the kidnappers wouldn't just tie you up with zip ties and put you in an unlocked plastic cell or "dungeon". Kidnappers would probably try to restrain you as much as they can and try to prevent you from escaping and they also don't just kidnap just so they can get a TV and they usually resort to physical violence.
So the “Kidnappers” have a PS5 but not TV bruh😂
Yeah just tear your scarf of and then Crush Them!
watching this video only taught me that i hate scarfs with tshirts the way some people hate socks with sandals..  something about it really gives me the anger.  grr.
Gimme... yourself
I was laughing so hard when you did the scarf hack😂
Maybe the blue eyed girl got kidnapped by them
The fact that Danny rented out a garage means he put more effort into this video than troomtroom who specifically designed their video on a budget
“Is troom troom kidnappers?” What kind of question even is that??? How else do you think they get their actors???
danny would be ded if he tried to dive in water, he could beraly hold his breath and puff out his chest
Just watch project MC squared to learn that the 'Scotch' tape trick works
Why don't she just take the gun and shoot em
Crush them *cough* I did it perfectly wrong  made me laugh so hard
Imagine if there was a saw game but the only way you could escape was by using troom trooms life hacks
yesss kevin youre getting so good at kidnapping! youve come so far man, im so proud of you.
11:22  *flabbergasted*
Or you can just lock your car (for the scarf one)
6:06 - I'm sorry....DID THEY SRSLY PHOTOSHOP THOSE MENS FACES ONTO THE BABIES!?!💀
Mar-en
24:52 romance.
Arrevidechi ( I think that’s how u spell it ) is goodbye in Italian ( I THINK )
At one point while watching this I swallow some water like people usually do then laughed so hard I choked on said swallowed water and the water just flowed out of my mouth like someone did CPR on me after drowning
Based on Nick's shirt, he's been to my local Walmart!
Did she fall into a tub of sprinkles why does her face look like that
9:07 came back to this video for a good laugh, then realized there was a naked, female mannequin in the basement.
Sometimes when somebody gets around me kidnapper too much they fall in love with them that's what this is also how did they not see the mask
boi
The second most scariest thing about this video isnt the kidnappers,dungeon,or the narrator, its the fact that shes wearing toe socks. I mean what are the chances that you choose to wear toe socks? I mean it has to be like one in forty eight million
the random "hoho hoho"
This was one year ago, but here’s an actual tip if you’re forced into a trunk. Kick the corner of the car repeatedly, non-stop. This should knock out one of the lights. I believe they should get pulled over. So uhm, hope you don’t need this advice ever- and I wish you have a good life and you’re safe! (Edit: Feel free to correct me if anything on this is wrong. I want you guys to have the correct facts)
If I was kidnap, all these life hacks wouldn't work. I don't wear shoes with shoelaces  Edit: Why are all the kidnappers  male there are female kidnappers
16:21 is the part he starts everything
You’re meant to hold your hands up and press your elbows together as hard as you can, then pull your hands to our sides to break the duct tape.
for some reason the happy go lucky 'iM bEiNg KiDnApPeD! 😃" had me dead
troom troom is a dumpster fire
When did her voice het so annoying
i just love that when she burns the plastic handcuffs she just stands up and opens the dungeon gate that is conveniently left unlocked.
Bro she was like 'thanks for kidnapping me here's a free TV
aRivAdErCHe LoSEr    I one hundred percent spelled that wrong lmafao
money
what do you do if a kinaper comes at you with that mask (me what i wolud do 🤣🤣)
You see the logic is If it wasn't for kidnappings there wouldn't be kidnapping escape life hacks to have video content on  😂 so "well done kidnappers" 🙌😂
ArivAdrüchee
Danny making the mask KILLED ME! Aren’t you supposed just cut out eye holes? What kind of ski masks have mouth holes? 💀  Edit: it’s my second time watching this and I just now realized he cut them out to look like the guy’s masks in the video 🤦🏽‍♀️
Do they only add ugly actor’s 🤔🤔🤔
3:32 The scariest part of this video is her socks.
It wasn't about hacks to escape kidnappers. More like, what not to do while kidnapping.
8:02 fact: all cars made after 2002 have levers in the trunk that open the trunk from the inside.
Man that narrators voiceacting is so fucking annoying
A picture of the babies are just baby dolls 😂
This guy is 27 in this video!
Ehat does arrividerci mean?  Jojo fans: i am glad you asked
In the video go to 9:21
22:00 in Germany, all WW1 documentaries have this musik
Arriverduchi. means goodbai in intalian
FUCK NICKISNOTGREEN 16:19
"If you don't have the scarf then they can't strangle you" okay am I stupid or did Danny forget that people can use thwir hands to strangle someone? /genq
bro has alot of guns and a dungeon but cant even buy a fricking tv
the narrator is very annoying tbh. I hate how she sounds louder than you.
i can't belive some of these worked .-.
13:56  pls
The way I actually laugh really hard I can’t watch you in my cousins house that I basically live in so like I sleep in the room where my grandparents sleep and they go to sleep early .  One time I tried watching you when they were asleep and there reallyyy strict so they scolded me and told me to sleep in my cousins room x-x
As dungeons go, that’s not bad tbh
Hi greg
Okay, but like, *why the fuck* is there a scene where two kidnappers throw a girl on a bed with chains-   Like idk maybe it’s just me but I thought that was going somewhere else for a moment
I’m pretty sure the that’s genius Kevin and great job Martin are the criminals talking about each other
Not Skyler definitely not having stockholm syndrome definitely
My mom said if I don't stop watching Danny Gonzalez, she'll slam my head in the keybkihrsv noifsvf kln x
Are oranges called oranges because oranges are orange Or is orange called orange because oranges are orange?   If hardly quin is the president what is your favorite color In the alphabet?  Mine is 11
Step 1. Circumcise the fabric glue.
6:10 is this sarcasm????????/gen
6:44 "We don't want money, we just want a TV!" How is he playing the PS5 then? The controller isn't even on 💀
4:16 She looks like Buzz's girlfriend from Home Alone 💀
I love nick. I couldn’t stop laughing watching this
troom troom: when you escape DONT tell the poliec about the kidnapping instead give them the ransome
I love how people treat troom troom videos seriously.
18:56 the reason you can't light the match by striking it against the wall is the lack of a chemical (I think red phosphorus). This chemical is usually contained in the strip on the side of the match box. This chemical makes it possible for the match to combust when striking it against smth
My god...This is so out of touch with reality!
Hay day badads
I wonder what happens BTS in a Troom Troom video.
why the coughing get me everytime
why is danny so ✨iconic✨
15:15 "I had to cut the tip off" 💀
the thing im most concerned about is that the kidnappers said "gotcha girly!"
Sketch 2 probably a case of Stockholm syndrome
toe toe toe toe toe toe toe toe toe toe yes
push the seat back to CRUSH HIM
Look up how Isadora Duncan died
(un)necessary knowledge time: it requres significant strength to break someone's neck. trying to snap it if you don't know what you're doing will probably hurt them but not kill them
so yall just not gonna talk about the socks...
That fkn robber mask is insane lmao
Him with the ski mask on makes him look like the guy from berserk
Hey as a suggestion, try gotcha it's a troom troom RIP off
4:24 - it's a hidden live hack for kidnapping victims: wait for Line Syndrome to kick in.
Then you can peel off the velcro and then…ÇRÜŚH HÍM 10:46
Heh… pulled the seat back to CRUSH HIM 10:11
the thumbnail sums it up perfectly
6:41 I love how they don’t have a tv but the have a ps5 which is basically the same price as a tv
What was stopping her from running away before she melted the handcuffs?
i think troom troom used google translate and thats how they got "theres criminals everywhere!"
I just realized a year later that... That's Nick... Huh...
9:19 This "life-hack" actually caught me off guard, I never laughed so hard in my entire life
Hi taegan hi brynn whats up freaks
The only thing you need to know about “kidnapping” is that you cannot allow yourself to be transported elsewhere. Even if it means dying on your front porch, you just have to say “fuck it, you’ll have to kill me right now”.
The chick in the Troom videos looks like the Cowardly Lion from the OG wizard of Oz.
The garage owner looking at his Camera...
11:50 the comedic timing of the  “…yeah :(“ was so shockingly funny to me that i choked and woke up my husband
Why is nobody talking about how the girl in the first hack has 5-toe socks 😭 ( 3:07-3:10) And the family portrait with everyone wearing ski masks??? (4:41)
Ayo did anyone else notice what looked to be a s3x doll at 9:03 idk
If the kidnappers don’t come back after 15 minutes, you’re legally allowed to leave.
I don't think  troom troom is Ukrainian, I think they're Italian (my reason I they keep saying arrevaderchi which is goodbye in Italian)
I love how cheerful and amused the narrator always sounds. It's like "did you get kidnapped by a strange man and get thrown into a van? 🤣🤣🤣 Did they drive you to an empty garage miles away from your home and tie you up and gag you so you can never see the light of day again? 🙋🙋 Did they threaten to kill your entire family if you try to reach the cops? 😆😆 You're not going to escape and you'll die in that garage, traumatized, starved and lonely!! 🤪🤪🤪"
No but it can incompasitate them Make them not be able to move there body It might snap the brain stem
Hi my son is friends with your nephew silas
did you know, if a burgular pulled a velcro scarf, the velcro would not stick?
I attempted the duck tape one and it did not work at all for me but then again I’m probably just weak af
Car seat hurts i got crushed by one once (not a thief) but it hurts like hell
My brain hurts after watching this 🤣
notice how he said "for free" when talking about toe socks. danny name a price and it will be done
Lol only thing missing during the first scenes kidnapping was the theme song for Duck Tails lol opps I mean oooo oooo!
Honestly It would be a much better hack to shoot the kidnapper then to WRAP YOURSELF IN A BLANKET.
When the narrators said “Got’cha Girly” it’s telling the first thing I thought of was childe
This video is crazy but the lady talking on the video her voice hurts my ears
Why does nobody Talks about the Girls socks ?! ( 03:09 min ) WHY DO THEY HAVE THESE LINES
29:20 the scream caught me so off guard
The narrator actually voices every character, the “Great job Martin!” Is actually the other kidnapper talking.
Nick just falling Inlove with Danny 🫵🏼💀🗿
2 things first of all what if the handcuffs aren’t rope and also…    WHO THE FRICK WOULD LEAVE A JAIL CELL DOOR OPEN?!
9:09 someone pls tell me what they said cuz I heard “areebadurchee losers”
I feel that this some kind of a not yet understood kind of art. It's so absurd it has to be ironic. Something so youtubers like Danny has something to make videos about.
Lmao holy shit this is one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen.  “ARRIVEDERCI LOSERS!!!”
Acually I think scotch tape would be harder to break then ducttape  Scotch tape doesn't tear as easy and gets folded and twisted up so bad it would basically be like tieing someone with a rope
Nothing to see here, just Danny and Nick engaging in some hardcore BDSM.
"That's genius, Kevin" could be an amazing meme.
Go to 3:09 why the hell does her toes have separate pockets in her socks
quote of the day: arrivedeci losers
Damn that was savage *trying to escape quietly from the kidnappers* “AREEVADUIRCHEUI LOSERS!!!!!!!!”
That fucking growl around 6:40 actually scared me more than most horror games
Wait how the fuck did she get her foot that high 😳
hihihihihihihihihihehehehehehehehehehehahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
those are TERRIBLE MATCHES WTF ARE THOSE ?!
4:39 LMAOOO🤣🤣🤣
What the actual fuck? Are they aliens? They are not in the general population are they?
8:40 Okay that's actually something that can help you but there realistically wouldn't be that big of a gap.
So... When she strikes the match against the wall, the bricks don't line up. That's either wallpaper or a green screen. So she lit a match on a totally flat smooth wall.
that female voice in those videos is super annoying...
came back here to see nick choking tf out of danny
I feel like
Your Australian?
I think we watched Troom troom in class
this guy is my new favorite youtuber
9:30. I didnt kidnap someone but yesterday someone did attempt to snap my neck.
If any of the people in this video got kidnapped they would be fucked
Look Danny, I’m sure this video is funny and all but I physically cannot listen to this troom troom voice for half an hour.
Ngl nick was strangely and suspiciously good at kidnapping
29:12 anyone else feel like this was a Regular Show moment?
Dude I just love their SKETCHES bro their SKETCHES. Sidenote did anyone notice the sex doll in the second video
It’s not possible to light matches using anything but the strip on the side of the box because to ignite it needs to react with a specific compound. I think it was phosphorus but I’m not sure 🤫 Also his sock could have caught fire… that didn’t seem like the smartest move 😅
4:44 got me dead bro😂
What the fuck troom troom
est intro into a sponsor!
how much tape are you going to put on the gu- I mean crimenal
(time 13:36) Thats what she said
9:48 No stupid, criminals kill people
duct tape is designed the way it is so that you can tear it without scissors I didn't know this wasn't common knowledge lol
15:06 When circumcision
I like you.... I shall subscribe.
I seriously thought the tape was just gonna be a more efficient way to simultaneously elbow yourself in both kidneys
4:59 had me laughing for 15 minutes straight
i did 5 layers and 7 layers of ducktape and it worked
I learned that last trick from a US Marine. The trick is mainly utilized with zip ties but as you can see, it works with tape too.
Moral of the story: pray that the kidnappers only have duct tape
im rewatching this and i had the horrifying realization that the troom troom video is like a kidzbop version of *365 days*
lol
unironically danny looks really good in a scarf
The funny thing is, I think actual scotch tape would be harder to break
are we gonna tell Danny that duct tape is made to be easy to rip?
now suffer
Yay you kidnapped a human being!
Geez, are these the same fools that put out the  "No, don't touch me there! This is my no no square?"
the tense up one works, but not as well as they show in the video, at best you can wiggle out faster and at worst you're marginaly more comfortable
i honestly think troomtroom is just owned by out of touch aliens
I like Danny’s voice here, he sound hot 😭 22:43
9:58 life hack: dont wear a scarf
Were, they not aware that duct tape is, perforated? Lmaoo
" quick quick!!! Bro her in the car"
11:12 the only hack that works
Did anyone notice the third hand for the first one
13:55 what if we paid
Is everyone just gonna ignore the mannequin in the background of 9:09 😂
This is ha lares as hell!!!!!!!😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😂😃😀
This is so weird!!!!!😀😀😄😄😊😅😅😂😃😃
i usually mute my sims so hearing sims music in this video really threw me off for a second
THE SLOW-MO OF HIM WALKING WITH THE SCARF- 🤣🤣
I got a Rinosheild case after watching this video a while ago and today the case just saved my phone after it fell of my balcony
4:35
That tensing thing was a houdini trick He was also very strong and fit, and knew how to escape from slightly loose ropes
Remember They legally can't kidnap you if you don't give consent...   I mean, they'll do it anyway... BUT IT WON'T BE LEGAL!
So, "arrivederci" means "until we meet again" in Italian. (was I the only one to look that up?)
that would kill him
9:20 as someone who does Brazilian jui-jitsu, this makes absolutely no sense.
1:46 I'm pretty sure that's the other kidnapper talking.
5:30 “the trigger was on the bottom half of his body” lmfao
okay... not even 6 minutes in and even Danny couldn't make it bearable. I rage quit.
I used to watch troom troom when I was like 8-9, and I have to say- Troom troom’s narrator did not have a voice this high pitched before, what the hell happened 🥲
Danny asking the Alexa what Areviderchi or however you spell meant made my Alexa go off and I proceeded to hear both Alexa’s sync up in giving the definition of what arveidechi means
this video is how i learned i needed to cut the tip off the fabric glue i've had for years i've just been using toothpicks and scooping it out the bottle
No bc Nick is kinda fine
GOOD BUT TO FR
its not as easy as people think to snap someones neck... in order to snap a neck, it would require a a force greater than 3,000 newtons....
snaping sumones neck yes it kill them
Denni's friend is the rare type of glasses wearer who isn't a 🤓
nick is so pretty
I've never laughed so much 😂 Also Danny slaying in that scarf 🔥
Plot twist danny writes for Troom Troom
can we talk about how hack #2 is the exact opposite of what you would want to do ??
Omfg my Alexa reacted exactly at the same time as the one in the video.
How did Troom Troom get worse?
Even if Danny doesn’t use hot glue, he still ends up getting burnt some hot liquid
Gets kidnapped: Me to the kidnappers: Can you run by starbuck to get me a hot cocoa. It’s cold back here. The kidnappers: This person is a fricking idiot.
The hell is that in the background of the chained to a barrel scene. It’s a naked doll. What the hell
You know what they say, It's never bad until you try it!
That ending got me, I literally said "Oh god" out loud 😂
I feel like troom troom are increasing the number of kidnapped people not decreasing them since kidnappers will see their videos and realise no one knows sh*t about escaping kidnappers
This was Nick's revenge arc after Danny kidnapped and hit his cat in Minecraft.
I’m pretty sure the scotch tape one works on zip ties
The jojo reference
GUNS DONT KILL PEOPLE UHHUHH I KILL PEOPLE WITH GUNS
3:07 Excuse me? Toe sock…
At 5:00 there are random guns on the wall?
What kind of manners?!?!
actually, i don't like basketball anymore, i like space
"I probably gotta cut the tip off, don't I?"  All rabbis ever.
First off, love the toe socks... but secondly, what is that yoga move at 3:34? lol
Watched with my kidnapper. We both liked and subscribed.
9:10 the way she pronounced arrivederci is so annoying
At school we were seeing how people get out of tape, put your arms around your shin and as fast as you can pull your arms into your shin. That should break the tape. Not guaranteed success
10:47 CRUSH THEM
15:07 jewish parents no cap
9:08 why is there a s3x doll on the floor
doiiiee
It’s the kind of knot you’d tie you fuckin square-Danny Gonzalez 2021
Aww too bad we didn't get to see his feet lol
When I saw the title I thought troom troom was teaching us how to kidnap
8:35 I honestly thought that was Jacksepticeye at first 😂
Heyy this was the first video I watched of Danny’s and here I am again
15:15 circumcisions be like
Hey Danny just got kidnapped and had to quickly watch this video 🤭 tysm for helping me escape🥳🥳 I'm currently driving away after stealing my kidnappers car
People say guns kill people people with guns kill people
This video hits different when you realize Troom troom makes fetish content, the toe socks really gave it away.
3:31 I know he's probably going to cover this later in the video, but that (in most cases) is completely impossible. The match when it strikes   the side of the box is caused not by a mechanical reaction but a chemical. If you took a match and struck it again a wall as hard as you physically could (in most cases) it will not light. There are matches that can be lit through a mechanical reaction, however these tend to be more expensive and rare compared to regular matchsticks pointless rant that is (probably) covered later in the video over.
Why is it so funny
The duct tape one does actually work.  Duct tape is made to tear. You’re supposed to thrust towards your stomach to tear it, thrusting downward does nothing but make you feel strong and powerful in the moment.
Unfortunately I cant do the tape break because I'm gay
is this video legal
The car seat one could work in that situation though if you have one that can go down fast
Stockholm syndrome be like
the dummy in the background is sus O_O
I’m mad I got a case and I haven’t gotten it it’s been like  months  and nothing
imagine a kidnapper watched this
You wont expose your feet on camera... ... ... ... For free?
If you’re ever being strangled you’re probably not gonna pull your scarf you’re probably gonna be using a zip tie or something and you could probably just recliner chair so it just hits your chin and then just pulled off
nah bro turn into scp 173 and snap their neck while they are behind you holding you
“The room is full of criminals”
Life hack when UR kidnapped:Escape
Can vouch as a dumbass person  That has no impulse control  The zip tie and the duck tape one work
"arrivederci" means "until we meet again" also they completely butchered the pronunciation, it's pronounced similar to "ah-reev-eh-deru-chi"
Why are all the kidnappers men and the kids girls?
One year ago this video was the first Danny video I’d ever seen so it’s my one year Gregiversery🎉1️⃣
No way you've watched this many troom troom videos without realizing they're satire haha, they're amazing
This video is guaranteed to blow up
Handcuffed with zip ties? OH NO! Fortunately they are made out of plastic that is just malleable enough to be torn apart by your teeth.
Cool 49ers hat
“arrivederci” is “goodbye” in Italian, so i’m assuming it’s a play on the Italian mafia.
I’m giggling like an idiot
the duct tape one like, you can use your fkin teeth, the real shit is that they tie you behind your back, making both hacks impossible lol
if you own a normal not rich kid car, you can do the seat hack
bro just you don't need a velcrow scarf you just recline it theres nothing stopping you
That narrator makes me want to kms
10:05 she is unfazed
This troom troom kidnapping stuff is kinda sexist (girl is victim 2 men are the captors(
1:58 you should be allowed to sue troomtroom for this until they lose their money and all starve slowly   3:36 most people don't even have matches   7:14 give me one reason why troomtrooms creators shouldn't be shot or something very painful   12:00 exactly and if they aren't they should still be treated as though they are it you're insane enough to submit this and then they get money for it while they only deserve chemical burns
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING🤣5:08
The second Life hack is really stupid you need like 1250 foot-pounds of torque to break someone's neck
Next video “How to successfully KEEP a kidnapped 👧🏻 🛏 “
i feel like the worst part of this troomtroom video is that it’s one of the first times i’ve seen social media accounts cast a fat girl as someone attractive and graceful. and they did it in a weirdly glorified kidnapping sketch.
4:48 isn't that Markipliers voice?
Bro can we get a hair tutorial already?
The kidnappers may have a dungeon, but do they have a dragon?
I think these are like a bad modern macgyver
If the only person who wants you is a kidnapper that means ur not Gregma sigma or alpha
WHY ARE HER SOCKS LIKE THAT?
0:41 sec when they say gotcha girly it sounds like Ralph Wiggum from the Simpson
I'm 6min into the video and it's definetly not your side, but Troom Troom's video is so much garbage and cringe in definition that I'm no longer able to watch this, I have a bad feeling, that my IQ will drop to zero
I honestly feel bad for Danny's pain with this corny not even realistic advice
Kidnappers have different ways in kidnapping, whether it’ll be blackmailing, threatening the whole family, etc. You wouldn’t expect a kidnapper playing with matches like a little kid, kidnappers are really DEAD serious at their acts.
on the thing where you hold your breath and puff up while the tying happens, don't horses do this? Like when the saddle is going on you have to be sure it's secure because they puff themselves up sometimes and then it's loose and rather unsafe to ride? I feel like that was actually pretty good advice, but idk.
12:32 👁d say
10:49 No they could have wired headphones a wire or a rope.
10:17 Lol you you would have to throw it back really hard cuz you have not cake. 😂
3:08 Her socks
She had toe socks—
Pretty sure you wouldn't need a tear away scarf to get out of that situation. If you had enough mental capacity while being throttled in your car (and you probably dont have a tear away scarf) pushing the back of your seat back might release you on it's own. But that's still a big maybe. You might also just be giving your assailant the higher ground in the situation but yeah. These are all super stupid. If you're able to stop an assailant from throttling you in your car you should probably just run instead of trying to "crush them with your seat"
Something tells me their names are nothing like Kevin, Martin, or Emily. More like Bogdan, Andrey, and Olena. And instead of doing homework at the college they attend they are filming stupid s like this.
So wait...should I get kidnapped for friends? OR SHOULD I DO THE KIDNAPPING FOR A FREE TV?!
To explain the duct tape one, you are essentially making your body into a wedge. Because of this, you are transferring the kinetic force of your arms into the the tape, and since you are doing it so quickly the tape breaks pretty easily. It's similar to using an axe to cut down a tree.
4:48 that is a markiplier noise 100%
where are they gm construct? 4:33
My kidnapper might also be watching these hacks
Or legs  I think
The tape one actually works - u just gotta hit it against your stomach really hard or stomach
The stockholm syndrome is big with the first one
It's intriguing because your recreation of a ski mask is the most believable out of the two versions in the video.
Danny you have no hope-
I don’t want do burn my hands (puts a match next to his hands
I think they say good job to the kidnappers cause that's how they get the actors and then they steal the props 👍😁😉
imagine the troom troom cast actually try to use these hacks if they get kidnapped
6:55 so the life hack literally was to give them what they want and they might let you go. Thanks troom troom!
3:09 bro what are those socks god damn 💀
Nick looks like Michael Jackson
The last thing troom troom needs to be doing is giving lifesaving advice 🙄
9:08 (pause) what is that in the left corner… 🤨 9:18 “just kill your captors by snapping their necks! 😜 10:05 just crush the person that’s choking you but before that rip of the scarf on your neck in exactly 1 second!
inhaling to expand your chest and widening your arms/legs just enough to not be super noticable actually does work. It was a trick used by several magicians to do escape acts. you can get a little bit of free room in the rope to manuever with. probably not as much as shown in the video, but you can get a decent amount
that bunny still haunts me!!!!
this is the first video I saw by Danny, and also my favorite
The matches they were using in the Troom Troom video were most likely “strike anywhere matches,” which would have made it possible to strike the wall.
1 how are they using random cat traps or some thing for a full grown woman 2 why is there a hole in the bush 3 why is the narrarator on the kidnappers side 4 why does the dude who didnt catch the girl so dumbfounded 5 why is the narrator still talking like a chipmunk 6 why do they have such a nice jail 7 why is the kid napper have matches and playing with them 8 why did they leave her for no reason 9 why are they in love with her 10 why was she not handcuffed 11 why the dude so mad 12 why did they have guns and why did they put her in the room 13 how is a cover going to do anything 14 why did they get a tv for trying to kidnap someone 16 why is she so S T U P I D
29:00 My guy went Super Sayian
BREAKING NEWS: Famous serial killer let go after judges found out that the criminal never killed anyone the knife and gun did. So now the gun is going through death sentence 💀
9:35 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The “duck tape” trick works with cable binders but not with tape
My man I had to click off the video when I saw "NickIsNotGreen" like bro wtf the mf is supporting bans.
The duct tape thing actually works. Me and my sister when we were young loved to try this out on each other
Troom troom be like: Put a penny in a microwave to become invisible! This only has a 60% chance of happening tho because you might survive!
But what if they don’t use your scarf to attack you what is the use like a rope that they brought or something
15:17........DOOEY
Oh my god the narrator's voice, it's so fucking high pitched it's carving its way into my brain
13:25 if thats what ur kidnapper looks like are u rlly still thinking why she gave them a tv and ps... I mean lool at this dude, there is no way u couldnt pity him and buy him some stuff
Actually, #2 could be reversed and it would work. Breathing in just wouldn’t allow you to breathe.
He sounds like mr beast kinda
If you do find yourself in a car trunk, (hopefully built recently, and it hasn't been cut) Pull the Glow in the dark escape Cord to manually open the trunk.
Didn't learn anything about kidnapping someone. 0/10
Just thought I’d say this to anyone who might be interested. The reason that the “kidnappers” had a hole in the back of the ski mask was because it wasn’t a ski mask. It was a balaclava. A mask with one large hole that covers everything but the eyes. Much like a ski mask tho
Or use your hands and take the tape off your mouth and BITE THE DUCK TAPE OF INSTEAD OF TRYING TO USE YOUR WEAK @$$ ARMS TO SEPRATE IT SOMEHOW
THIS WAS MADE A YEAR AGO? I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS WHEN IT CAMW OUT
It's so funny that Danny's version of breathing in is just filling his cheeks with air and hoping for the best
If you're locked in a trunk of a moving vehicle there should be a lever or button that glows in the dark to open the trunk from the inside, if they have removed this  kick out the headlights from the inside and stick your hand through the hole and wave, if you're on a road with other vehicles someone may see your hand and call the police. If someone grabs your arm aggressively to pull you into a vehicle or something, do not pull away, instead bring your elbow towards their elbow and then curl your arm up and away.
That is the worst type of fabric glue me dude, try fabric tack. Not tacky glue it's like using Elmer's glue instead of contact cement.
A collar can probably be used
A long time ago I met a professional escape artist and he did teach me how to do the duct tape wrist thing, I think troom troom explained it bad but I was surprised they actually had legitimate advice at all.
It means goodbye in italian.
The fact that he jokingly asked Alexa something and an Alexa did answer is the scariest thing in this video.
8:07 what the hell?
4:40 “hohohoHO”
0:58 he starts watching the videos 12:15 he makes the stuff 15:52 he tests the life hacks
Just remember guys if you get kidnapped just wiggle your finger no and remind them they can’t do that because it’s illegal
the stupidity of the self defense move of snapping ur attackers neck is retarded. firstly that physicly not possible and your probably gonna get sentenced to jail if u manage to somehow do that
you can light up a match on dry tiles. i used to do it as a kid
“Come on out Daddio” my dirty mind that’d what she said
I love your videos they are absolutely hilarious this is why I subscribed
good
I’m being kidnapped “says cutely”
"With a box of matches You can play fun games!" I can name some games 1. Arson .2 Molotov thorwing 3. FIRE IN THE HOLE 4. california thats all im gonna say.... ifykyk
Fr
just use the guns on the door handle and criminals
That’s a felony and very truly traumatizing ,good job marten!
This is painful to watch
I AM GREG
i love  this.This got me laughing so hard
i thought the title said team trotom
arrivederci losers
Omg, my Alexa actually reasoned
omg guys! this room is full of criminals!!
“Guns don’t kill you criminals do, and guns are criminals”made me laugh like HhÈÄHAä
Scotch makes duct tape 25:53 😂
Remember kids, when you get kidnapped, be sure to send them a gift to show your appreciation!
This is like the most low key triggering collection of videos I have ever seen
guys named greg: hol up
11:34 that actually works
11:00 Are you tied up, PERFECT!
ari ari ari ari air areveterchi losers
Danny and nick together are so funny
9:36 dale moment
this video 😭😭😭😭😭 😂
I now know to do 5 layers of scotch tape 😅😅😂😊😊 thanks so much😂😂
one question why didn't the mail guy that had the TV ask them "why are you  wearing sky masks at home"
“GoTcHa gIrLiE!”
0:21
0/10 didn't help me on kidnapping people
What's funny is I recently burned myself with hot glue doing a school project. It tore off a lot of skin on the side of my hand 14:45
KRUSH THEM
I think the whole "drop the seat to crush him" idea is just troom troom misunderstanding advice about getting strangled from the back seat. In theory, if you have a non-powered seat and can just drop the seat back, you can possibly get out of someone garroting you from behind by literally dropping out of the garrote.
wow, i read that title _so wrong_ My brain instantly went to *''wait...there's hacks on how to kidnap people?''*
"Oh god! Get out of my throat!" 😐
Bruh she can just stand up
Did you say funking NASA?!?!?
was troom troom saying that if u kidnap people for troom troom they reward u 🤔
The snap the neck hack is fake because he can just choke you faster than you snap his neck so what you want to do is upper kick the kidnapper in the balls/nuts area
only matches ive seen that u can strike against anything is the ones that have the white tips.
9:07 whats that on the floor?
The car at 7:49 has a troom troom license plate
Me hearing “arrivederci”: Is that a Jojo reference??
I bought that same fabric glue for a thing, had the same experience of not realizing you had to cut the top off lol
Holy crap your facial expressions are hilarious.
wtf is troom troom on
5:19  This just makes me think about the unused Mega Man 3 enemy that's just a pistol with legs and googly cartoon eyes.
GETCHA GIRLY lol Danny is the best
the better scheduled jontron
When did the Troom Troom narrator become Minnie Mouse?
We now have the great privilege of knowing what Danny would look like as a centaur
The most annoying part isn’t the stupidity of the video, but the narrator’s f*cking voice. I’d rather listen to all The Chipmunks albums back to back
Ugh it’s so boring sitting in a  dungeon while there’s a kidnapper with a gun
those awful life hacks work
Love the Mk 1 refrence, litterally have an Mk1 arcade in my room
Well "Emily" WHY DID YOU SNAP HIS NECK AND GIVE HIM A TV LIKE THE LAST GIRL
Troom Troom + My brain = dead
13:37
From the words of Gideon Gleeful from Gravity Falls, “I AM NOT A GIRL”.
The story was written by a person with Stockholm syndrome and a tendency to regress as a coping mechanism.
You, and every debunker. are. all lightsavers... LITERALLY! Your helping keep people safe by telling them the truth and NOT what these idiots are doing. Thank you.
Why is the narrator micky mouse
5:37 when I heard “guns don’t kill people” I immediately thought of Jon Lajoie’s song called I kill people, lmao, look it up, yw.
The Sims 3 background song in the intro is fire dude
I’m crying with laughter
12:40 ya you were
21:13 this entire sequence had me cry laughing
3:07 those toes took me out omfg
What in the Wattpad hell is this?

11 months later with newfound knowledge, clearrrrly this is fetish roleplay
I used to watch troom troom for fun when I was bored
I think you’re better at throwing it back than you think Danny
im being kidnaped jingle noise
When you lowkey genuinely feel some shared accomplishment and pride when they both actually manage to break the tape 😅 le'sss fkkknnn Goooooooooooooo!!!! Mfkn slay queen's/kings/Gregs¿? Idfk but gd vid danke
Tip for kidnapping victims, if you manage to grab a gun from a kidnapper, shoot his partner first before a struggle for control of the gun starts.
That family picture of the kidnappers leads me to believe that the ski mask is a part of their body. Maybe like a kind of skin shell.
Troom Troom crafts are amazing and totally realistic
you cut that tip off the glue bottle LIKE YOU DIC oh why are the cops a my door
Girl using a dang leprechaun trap-
The duct tape trick is real. I was taught that trick once in school. Still cool to see you tried it with so many layers
Troom troom is geared towards kids, if my kids watch this channel I would be mortified
I’d rather watch this for advice then urban survival training
Digging the sims 3 music in the background
Foot fetishes are the most common fetish in the world and he called them all sickos wow…
This video has a full-on Buffalo Bill situation, and the girl is bored. Can you imagine watching "Silence of the Lambs", and the girl that Buffalo Bill has locked in his basement is just bored? He's going to kill her and turn her skin into a suit he can put on to pretend to be a woman...and she's bored.
boys being boys 🥹
IM WATCHING THIS ON MY TV AND MY ALEXA ANSWERED WHEN YOU ASKED WHAT ARRIVEDERCI MEANT AND IT SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME LMAO mostly cause i forgot i have one and it’s right underneath my tv sjxjdkskd
he did it
21:53 the clip speaks for itself
I love to watch these kinds of videos now I know not to use duct tape anymore I’ll just use rope
The holding your breath hack is a thing horses sometimes do that makes the saddle fall off, so I kinda buy that one.
Also as if you couldn’t just lift the box lmao
About a year ago I saw this on my recommended and I subscribed right after, I thought you were a high schooler 🤣
Pro Life Tip For When You're Kidnapped! *Kill your kidnapper*
i can confirm, the UK duct tape works too, ive tried it as well
17:32 The mosquito in my room
Nah but last one really works...I tried aswell and it worked😳
danny fyi arrivederci DOES mean goodbye and it is italian
Wait a second the first life Hack the dungeon door was unlock she could of just opened it
Troom troom is like the last two braincells in my brain.....🤣🤣
And here I thought the old troom troom narrator was annoying yet troom troom manages to find a even more annoying one who somehow manages to have a vocie crack at every line
While it's not common to leave matches lying around it is a common practice to light matches in front of your captive, threatening to throw the lit match on them or hold it as close to them as you can do they feel they pain, the danger.  So I've been told anyway
“It was kinda dangerous” **cuts to Danny being legitimately choked with panic and fear in his eyes**
I’ve been following for years so idk how this is the first time I’ve seen this video but it was amazing
“Areavache losers😆”
That "No" at  27:07 was perfect
6:27 criminals*
13:20 WHY DID HE LOOK LIKE JAKE PAUL???????!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
22:52 favorite part
4:55 HAHAH
Look like Walmart Batman
The troom troom voice makes me wanna cry, it sounds so unnatural and in pain I hate it😭😭
arrivederci,. - bruno bucciarati after defeating pesci
this video is incredibly funny
my favorite part of this video is danny thinking she says “straighten yourself” instead of strain yourself
9:07 BRO WTF
Keep up the good work
"I'm being kidnapped!"  *intro rolls*  and that was the last we ever saw of the Troom Troom girl.
Are you being strangled “yeah😞
Jaidiferous your right
8:34 THEY HAVE CHAINS *Sniffs chain*
* WHY DOES HER SOCKS HAVE TOE THINGS WTF
"god get out of my throat"  but dannnnyyy
The duct tape one works bc of the structure of the tape. It’s made to rip sideways like that, hence that’s how you can rip it off the roll. However it doesn’t rip like at all if you try to rip it in the other direction which is why it’s strong tape
if you watch their video they’ll kidnap you and hope you’ll use the life hacks and buy them a playstation when you escape
Why does she sound like Princess Peach?
WHY DK HER SOCKS HAVE TOE INDENTS
9:44 it would kill the person. There IS a VERY, VERY rare chance they survive. They will be paralyzed neck-down though.
A quote from Theodd1sout “No means no Ada-“
In reality the kidnappers would be like “Shut your mouth lady or you won’t have a mouth to shut”
theory: troom troom kidnaps people and makes them act in their videos until they give them ransom.
I used to watch Troom Troom unironically when I was like 10 I'm so disappointed in myself :L
Bro Emily broke dudes neck (yes it dies usually kill you)
Skyler is like the best kid nap victim leaving a tv gift
Danny scotch tape his rrealll
After they got the TV it cut to an ad about therapy
9:20 “Detroit Urban Survival Training taught me this one”
when he said WHY I ADA
Омg that.     Ok
Danny, I love your ads.
21:38
“Recommended putting leaves In Your hair to look like Billie Eilish” 😂🤣  I never even seen that one but that’s really funny 😂
Just tried the tape thing with HD clear tape and it did not work. Kidnappers should use that instead of duct tape.
1:25 they sound like mickey mouse
we all know danny is watching these to escape being abducted by ratatoing
Who the fuck has finger socks-
"Danny I feel like it's choking you! " *Danny fighting for his fucking life*
The first video could casually be some american cartoon trope (and id defenitely watch that)
because of this video someone wears toe socks out all the time
Danny struggling trying to make a ski mask is making me laugh hysterically at 1:30 am I have to leave for a flight in five hours please help
the only accurate part of this life hack was the drawing of mortal kombat on the cardboard tv
9:42  yes yes it does
Giggty-g-g-g GET IN THE CAR
3:32 This life hack is literally fire bro🔥🔥🔥💯💯       But what is all that smoke and the weird smell🤨
The duct tape one works
I don’t want life hacks that say “MAY safe your life.” I want life hacks that WILL save my life.
Am I hearing The Sims 3 sim creator music on the background? 😄
8:51 i remember reading about that in Donald Duck years ago so they definitely didn't come up with it lmao
danny i come back to this video every month to rewatch. it’s my favorite commentary vid ever made LMAOOOOO ITS SO GOOD DUDE. this is iconic and amazing and so so so slay. thank you
nick is looking rather green...
Look at that criminal on the wall 😨
If you look at the cell door you’ll notice there’s not even a lock
third time watching this video, and like the tenth the part in which he swallows the ski mask particles
A year ago I watched this when it came out. I was sick with covid, and today I’m rewatching it as I’m sick with covid again
The tape thing actually works with a ziptie! You just have to do it with enough force. My dad tried to teach me how to do that when I was like 8 years old and I wasn't strong enough and all my cousins could do it but I couldn't and I was stuck so I started hysterically crying until he cut it off of me
3:09 WHO THE HELL WEARS SOCKS WITH THE FABRIC TUCKED IN BETWEEN THE TOES
I honestly need a sketch show with Danny and Nick
the tied up/breathe in thing, you are supposed to inhale deep not hold your breath like a cartoon character lmao
These guys remind me of the robbers in home alone
Troom Troom's Skylar gives off Mary McElroy vibes.
The narrator said “great job” as the other kidnapper
25:28 bruh how did Danny run 30 ft in 2 seconds 😭
is nobody seeing the naked manequin???
Danny wearing the scarf like a dupatta was really something
“I feel like I was really choking you”  “You were”  That made me laugh so hard lol
14:29 I got burnt from Hot glue
Uh she's a little too big to kidnap... they would need like 3 people to carry just her....
“I feel like I was choking you there for a while” “Yea you were”
So, I dunno why I'm doing this, but to answer Danny's questions when breaking someone's neck, they don't die immediately.  You paralyze the neck down, causing them to feel the pain of the break while also suffocating to death shortly after.  Yep.
I LOVE BEING GREG
14:11
Girl put them grippers away😁
Me before church: “ yourself”-Danny
Remember this,  If your ever being kidnapped just say.    ` ` Stop it, i don’t like it. ` ` Then they can’t legally kidnap you.
"gimme ur ge-ge-get in the car" nice pirate rap
13:32 oh em gee it's corey taylor
Her socks have toe part for her feet... Out of context.
I like the look of disgust on Danny's face when his friend says he could stand up with the rope
when danny was almost blonde 💀
I love that they say arrevederche. Im pretty sure there trying to say goodbye is Italian but i could be wrong
Im always suprised when people don't actually know about the duct tape thing i thought that was common knowledge?
16:29
Narrator: "they mean business this time! They have chains!"  criminal: **sniffs**
1:28 the way that high-pitched lunatic of a voice actor just goes "gOtcha, girlie! You can't get aWAy noW!" while sounding almost like she was holding back hysterical laughter is perhaps one of the funniest things I've seen today
Why are all those videos seems like the start of a porn
Guns don’t kill people criminals kill people -Danny 2024
The correct way to do it is hitting your stomach to break the tape even though it may hurt
15:14 Doctors after a male is born
Duct tape is literally designed to tear that way so you can tear the strips
4:36
Yo why does the narrator sound like mickey mouse or smn
hej
disclaimer: snapping a neck will NOT kill someone always. It can kill, but not always
some of these were edited
Horses breathe in when they're being saddled so that the girth is looser.
I cannot be the only person who thought these were “how to kidnap someone” hacks at first.
I was just watching the IT crowd and one of the main characters named roy said arrivederci the way danny says it is “arebadurchy” but it’s like an actual word
I had a breathing problem while watching this video that's house much i laughted
gross tesla
29:00 the sneak attack tho 😂
18:38 this might be the funniest twelve to fifteen seconds on YouTube
“Truly Traumatizing” aka Troom Traum ™
this is the best piece of media ive seen in my life
9:32 the mood change killed me
ok but on a serious note, if children are watching the videos, they take them seriously. it’s making light of a serious thing that parents are terrified of ever happening, hoping their kids will know it’s not a fucking joke. it’s kinda sad
ok but on a serious note, if children are watching the videos, they take them seriously. it’s making light of a serious thing that parents are terrified of ever happening, hoping their kids will know it’s not a fucking joke. it’s kinda sad
I laughed way too hard at them trying them.
I think the narrator is Mickey Mouse on hormones
Why would you need toe socks to pick up matches. She already got her shoe of with her other foot, just take of your sock with the other foot too, it's not that hard.
Danny I am truly disappointed in you, you know we don't call it kidnapping the correct term is gregnapping duh
God the voice is getting worse and worse...
“i felt like i was choking you for awhile there” “yeah you were” 😭😭
I think the girl who bought them a television had Stockholm syndrome.    So that really took a dark turn.  I think a few of the hacks could work if they were executed better.  For instance, on certain kinds of matches will ignite when scratched against a hard surface.  Most matches are safety matches that must be struck against the match book.  And it's very unlikely you would get matches thrown at you.  But it is possible that you would be making your escape with your hands still tied and find some kind of flame along the way.  A stove, some matches, or a cigarette lighter.  And zip ties would be a pretty common way for a kidnapper to secure your hands.  So that part is pretty plausible.  As for inhaling while being tied up.  Maybe not the most effective thing to do.  But there might be other ways to make yourself a little larger while being tied up.  Maybe have your hands a little further from your body, etc.  You just need to be careful that the kidnapper doesn't notice what you are doing.  And that might make it a little easier to slip out of your ropes.  But, generally speaking, following life hacks when you are kidnapped might not be the best idea.
I love frogs 🐸!!! Love your shirt
I think the scariest thing was the girl being forced into a bed
Danny winked at me😏
Good vid
Plot twist: Skylar gave them a tv not out of gratitude, but so that they didnt have a reason to kidnap anyone else
The narrator’s voice hurts me so much. It’s like a lady version of Chilled mixed with mickey mouse
Arrivederci (アーリベデルチ) (Goodbye)

Dear lord the Troom Troom narrator's voice is like nails on a chalkboard
16:29 19:33 24:24
WORD PRONUNCIATION ACCORDING TO DANNY: Ambience: *Arm-Bee-Arns.* Duvet: *Doo-*VEIGH*.*
I legitimately busted up laughing at the "if all else fails, JUST KILL YOUR CAPTORS"😂😂😂
The girls in my school got taught how to do that duct tape thing at every safety assembly
Just scotch tape their hands behind their backs, step up your kidnap game smh
Its like Troom Troom is trying to glorify kidnappings: the girl enjoys her kidnapping, the kidnappers get rewarded for what they've done. Plus, the narrator sounds so happy. "Watch your step, Skyler 😃 Now, she's getting kidnapped 😜"  And then suddenly: "Snap his neck 😐"
16:29lol
A VERY interesting fact about breathing in while being tied up was actually how Houdini (and later used by performer magician Chris Angel) escaped all those traps where they were tied up and bound, then placed in dangerous situations. It is a classic old magician's tactic used in actual performances when they are really tied up and placed in danger. FYI the CORRECT method to do this is to breathe in and tense your muscles ONLY when they are tensing the bindings.
Why is the summary of the first list of hacks "What's the BEST way to avoid kidnapping? STOCKHOLM SYNDROME." YeAh thAt'LL WoRk...
God that sweatshirt goes so hard I’ve tried so hard to find it 😅
Also advice SET THEM ON FIRE
I get kidnapped: AHHH LET ME GO YOU GUNS
😎👍
Imagine walking down the street and seeing two random guys trying to light a match with their feet 🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:33 is no one going to point out that in this shot she's very clearly holding this match with her hand in a glove? Why're you giving survival techniques that just don't work in real life situations?!
This is probably the most wholesome reason two men could rent out a garage to tie each other up in
The true crime here is the girl in the jail cell is wearing toe socks.
I never knew troom troom had tips for kidnapping people I guess I should watch it more often
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yes
Ah yes the kidnappers put you in a room with two GUNS(also know as a criminal)on the wall
I can’t take my phone out of my rhinoshield case 😓
Best friend goals: 24:52
the square knot jokes are so fucking funny i swear
It's so interesting the video is so much interesting everything about it it's so much interesting I like it
Ah yes so genius to put a box on a stick so big brain
yo new name for the vid on "troom troom" {my idea:how 2 catch a human (how 2 kid  nap) }}
25:01 I'm dead💀🤣
This is still my favourite fucking video, i keep coming back to rewatch it. The way danny struggles while being strangled in a bit that he set up, how nick stares lovingly at danny in a scarf, how excited they were when the duck tape actually broke, how danny couldnt kept a straight face while tensing his muscles and finally, how fucking upset they were when troom troom called duct tape scotch tape. Its a masterpiece that makes me cry laughing every single time
9:48 it can kill you if your spinal cord is broken/torn near the brain stem if not seek immediate medical attention.
bro by watching this troom troom video u get to go to juice worlds concert
That photo of the parents in bandit masks is literally a Joe Wilkinson joke in 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.
22:16 Danny really standing like a super villain making a speech about how he's gonna take iver the world and its about to cut to a flashback while he tells a tragic backstory and then the main character forgives him and the live happily ever after.
Are you tied up with scotch tape?             *perfect!*
Oh my god babe this video was so funny also also you like needa pay premium
Couldn’t he steal the car?
That was a big cardboard box. Lol wonder why
They always use that terrible voice in their videos
They are real danger for kids
I’m gonna bet that there is at least 1 kid out there who thinks these hacks will work.
Great job Martin! That’s a felony 😁😁 that’s genius Kevin 🥳😆
technically speaking it is brain stem manipulation witch could kill them or knock them out for 20 min to 50 hours
The scarf thing is kinda stupid cause chances are they would use a garrotting string or something to strangle you like that, and not just count on you wearing a scarf
0:40 this sounds like Mickey Mouse
Is no one gonna talk about her socks.
4:43 did anyone else see the guns on the wall she could just take the guns
What do you mean”guns don’t kill people”
24:52 im pretty sure i usually have to pay for thiss stuff 😯😯
This is my favorite fucking video. Nicks awkwardness paired with Danny's earnestness makes it so strange in the most hilarious way.
Why do you have an Alexa in a warehouse looking place
To be honest, i don't get why any of these hacks aim for the head of the kidnappers first.  I mean, get them on the ground and stomp on their head, that would be very effective.
I have the answer for neck thing, 70% of yes if you mess up in any way. If successfully 10% change of killing them
We just going to ignore that one of their "life hacks" is legit just: Is your phone not bright enough?! *THEN PUT A F-ING*BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND TIE IT!!!!!!!!!*
Ooooof the human trafficking vibesin this troom troom video is STRONG
do not drink water when watching him
favorite part of the square knot joke is a square knot is a real knot
Real lifehack: If you are trapped in a trunk and you've been kidnapped, unplug the back headlights so the police pull them over. Then bang on the trunk door.
The tape one actually does work, you just did it wrong. You're supposed to swing your elbows back to your sides
Danny: screams in tiptie on wrists Cc: music
Not A robot 1 second ago “She’s getting in the car unsuspectingly” yea cuz I always wear a strangle proof scarf when I’m not suspecting to get strangled. Im paranoid. When my paranoia is bad enough I feel the need to wear that scarf 24/7 then I’m also just checking the back of the car/waiting until I’m calmer before going into the car. So this is completely useless. If you’re paranoid enough about getting strangled by someone in the back of your car to wear this you just check the damn car.
The ending makes me wonder if she developed Stockholm syndrome (I think that’s the word but when you start enjoying spending time with your kidnappers)
She is surprisingly chill after being thrown onto a bed, with a chain and ropes next to the bed on a table. In my opinion that never leads to anything good, but troom troom just didn’t really follow through with it
agree
I T S  A  T R A P
honestly when the girl ran out while the car was having "troubles" there is soo much of an easier way to do it. just wait until they get to a red light in a fairly busy intersection, unlock the door (most cars come with backseat lock-unlock mechanisms, but then again you would have to be in the back seat-) open it and just jump out, and run as fast as you can. they cant chase after you since there would be a lot of people there and everybody would see, and the car would still be on or if they turned it off well i mean- but then if you do successfully escape, you can call like, and uber driver or something to take you back home.
15:15 ill cut your tip off ;)
Action figure hairdoo
This was honestly kinda scary to watch because of how shit all of these were
Why does the first narrator for the first video sound like Mickey Mouse
"what's a square knot?" "the kind of knot you'd tie you fuckin square" is so good and he gets him twice.
Playstation sucks!!!!!!!!
Am i’m being kidnapped!!:  cutely gets dragged into a door 😸👍🏻👍🏻
I didn’t expect to learn an actual useful trick with that tape one.
7:46 nobody:  The voiceover: "🙂😁QUICK! QUICK! THROW HER IN THE TRUNK!😊😃"
These Troom Troom videos made it easier for me to kidnap people!
The beginning of a kidnapper-to-lovers story when Nick realized how good Danny looked wearing the scarf is the best moment in this video
No one noticed at 8:30 there was a random naked mannequin?????
Is anyone gonna talk about they wanted her to stay in bed a bit sus 😳🤔🫥
Are you wearing a rainforest cafe shirt
"Smells like Walmart in here"
9:07 kinda weird how they play off kidnapping as a joke but all I can think about is that mannequin in the background and it's telling me what these kidnappers' intentions might be and it scares me
21:48 cute
the voice the va girl uses gives me violent urges
While being shackled in jail to be transported you have to lift your arms up, while they're chaining your waist you push your gut out as far as possible. Then while attaching your wrists to your waist you relax. It makes it a little more tolerable!! So Troom Troom got 1 thing kinda correct!!  The duct tape works! As you're coming down pull your arms apart as hard as possible!
Arrivedurci is acctualy a weir pronounviation of the word arrivederci which is bye bye in italian.i am not fun at parties
Am i the only one crying laughing
I hate the first narrator so much
I like how the lady in the dungeon blows on the match after, like she doesn't want to hurt them
Stockholm syndrome, making it work for me
4:41 we goin ignore they got two pistols hung up on the wall…
HER SOCKS!!! THIS IS A CRIME!!
That video is traumatizing just to look at
Holy Shit, that narrator's voice must be one of the most annoying things I ever had to experience
this video is about what will happen when gen z gets kidnapt also i cant spell
my dog broke in our room
Danny: and if I don't have toe socks I have to go bear feet and on camera    Bluring: am I a joke to u
the scarf-wearing pose at 15:35 lol cute
The scotch tape/duct tape thing is still funny to me because if that actually was scotch tape, the hack probably wouldn't work
my grandpa was actually kidnapped by a man in a white van when he was younger so he broke out of the van which was on the road and still driving and like rolled out
im not even gonna say all the sussy things he said
" I did it perfectly wrong it seems" this is what I will use from now on
Is the first one a Disney movie
I've been watching Drew since the absolute  beginning. I've seen every single video he ever made. And after watching this video several times since the first time when it came out THIS IS SINGLE HANDEDLY THE BEST VIDEO HES EVER POSTED
Daddy O
Nah that home made foot sock looked more like a penis
good to know , ill need 4 layers of duck tape uhh i mean scotch tape
15:11 that’s what she said  “ the tip was closed”
Bro my Alexa went off and said the same thing at the same time XD
Yup this will totally happen
I’m actually surprised that the duct tape (I mean Scotch tape) one worked.
Crying watching this. Love this lmfao
watching adds are way better then watching troom troom
12:34 h*tler
28:02 whats up with the crotches in the background??
Is no one going to talk about the random mannequin that was in the background of the troop troop video?
Stockholm syndrome
Hear me out, the red crook kinda fine
BRING NICK BACK
"Are you tied up with scotch tape? Perfect!"
i thought that tape thing was more common knowledge LMAOO maybe i just grew up weird
danny shouldve done 10 layors
*shoots person* no don't arrest me, the gun did it!
The narrator litteraly voice cracks ten times a second
Or just elbow the kidnapper and run into the nearest populated place
With the first life hack why is the cage door unlocked?
arrivederci losers!🫡
arivadurtchi losers 😎
Snaping someone's neck does unavailable life for them because it breaks connection from the spinal cord to the brain  🧠
E
I am surprised practically its okay to "hate" on channels.
19:33 “Is that fucking fish JENGA?!”
If all els fails just snap there necks life hack 🥸👍 🤓👍
are we gonna ignore the doll at 9:07 like what
I KNOW THIS VIDEO IS OLD AND THERE ISNT EVEN MUCH USE IN COMMENTING BUT OMG THE SIMS MUSIC AT 0:27 - 0:57 IS SO NOSTALGAIC 😭😭😭
That first narrator triggered my cluster headaches.
I think the chain thing in the second troom troom video is a military escape method when your held in a hostage situation I think
wow, daniel, he had very eyes, bery blue eyes, very blue. like denim. denim blue. eyes. very nice, very stare. i can see when he stares. because he has eyes. and so do i.
Wow the duck tape one actually worked better get myself kidnapped and ask them to tie me up with duck tape three times and do that
9:07 bottom left corner above the toxic bin what is that thing im almost too scared to ask
*GREAT WORK MARVIN YOU DID IT!*
We def need more nick 😍
Because I am, in fact, the best kidnapping expert, asking for small things like a glass of water can lead to bigger and bigger things in the future. It wont help you escape, but it will make your life more bearable
is anyone gonna talk about danny using sims 3 music during the beginning of his video  i recognize versimilitude anywhere
I had to put this video on subtitles just bc of the gurls voice 😭
Great Video! *These life hacks are extremely ridiculous!*
22:14 why did I think he was gonna say the N word 💀
24:42 the bataman (2022)
i love how the car door was the criminals for a second in 8:07
Aside from the cussing and kidnapping scenario you’re channels pretty wholesome I like it.
I can’t take this voice that the first story’s narrator is doing, it’s like a drunk Mickey Mouse, and I hate it 💀
The reason the duct tape trick works is because the seams on the sticky side of the tape are horizontal, so it's easier to rip vertically, ike when you need to use a piece of tape, that's the direction you use to rip it. The upward to downward motion of the arms plus the force as you bring them into your chest is a forceful vertical motion so it rips the tape
what is greg
I mean duct tape is made to be torn by hand 💀💀
I was crying laughing when Danny was holding his breath being tied up
"ARRIVEDERCI" (Music stops)
To explain the scarf, no its not a catch 22, because the attacker will just grab you by the neck.
bro not the toe socks 😂
WHY IS THE TROOM TROOM VOICE TALKING LIKE THAT!? WHYY!!!!!!!! "OOh nOo sHE is suppOsed to BE scAAAERD"
9:09 is nobody going to talk about the naked women doll?  no?    *ok*
Greg
Is no one gonna mention the mannequin that's snapped in half at 9:10?
If the guy tried to strangle her I’m pretty sure he would have a gun as back up, so as soon as she shows her face it’s kinda just💥💥💥
Ah yes, troom troom
Danny’s friend is pretty funny
feat pics at 14:20
Nick is hilarious. He needs to be on more.
Lol am I the only one that got a SimpliSafe ad that had a robber with a comically cut mask?
9:08 look at the bottom right
5:36  Wise words
this was really one of the channels my school let us watch 😭
“I’m being kidnapped!” *gets dragged into the void*
This was my first Danny Gonzales video. I have been Greg ever since
My respect for Danny after not buying his kidnapper a tv 📉📉📉
I laughed so hard my water almost choked me
15:14 When your jewish       Im sorry
Stockholm syndrome
Snapping a neck has a low chance of killing someone, and will almost always just paralyze someone for life if done correctly. And they will be screaming the entire time so it won't exactly be stealthy
OH NO DONALD DUCK KIDNAPPED A RANDOM CHILD WITH.. PLYWOOD!!!!
me a nieve subscriber: who's greg?
Idea: Troom Troom Videos But If There’s Even One Useful Tip You Have To Use ONLY Materials From Any 3 Tips From The Videos Of Your Choice To Break A Nokia Phone.
"Are you tied up with duct tape? Perfect!"
That duct tape thing is really cool
Foot revveaal
The scariest part of every TroomTroom video is the narrator with a voice that's annoying as hell that won't shut the f*** up. I swear to whatever cruel deity that created humanity, I have to mute the volume because that fake ass voice grates my ears so much.
Danny thinking that a match's scratching sound is correlated to it lighting is so funny to me
😃
what's better than this? guys bein' dudes
ᴛʜᴀᴛs ɢʀᴇᴀᴛ ᴍᴀʀᴛ W͟H͟A͟T͟?̲!̲
Dale is shitting himself right now
I was not prepared for 9:22
wait ... at the beginning the door of the dungeon is open and her feet aren't even tied couldn't she just run?
The fact that her name is Skyler and that's my name, it feels so weird
ayo 13:37 :get out of my throat" lol
For anyone who’s wondering, arrivederci means “goodbye until we meet again” in Italian
You know I watched a really good psychological horror movie about kidnapping and brainwash... Maybe the main character would have escaped if she had watched Troom Troom! 😊
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NARRATOR
You remind me of chandler from Friends
HELLLPPP WHEN YOU COUGHED ONE LAST TIME DPING THE SKI-MASK I FUCKING DIEEEDDD😭😭😭
danny: ok thats actually funny also danny: *straight face*
“How much force I would have to put into throwing it back to crush someone, but I guess it’s worth a shot”
This video is so Romantic 🥰
By the way if you are actually tied at the wrists with duck tape DO NOT DO WHAT TROOM TROOM DID. Because it can actually dislocate your wrists
Nick is the most compliant kidnapper in the world
danny is like a little kid lol his excitement over the match making a match noise
The reason the "scotch tape" hack didn't work is because your mouth wasn't taped, so do it again and suffocate yourself
I know this is an old video, but honestly I love your content. One of my favorite youtubers, even though I only recently found your channel in June. But I do still love it. Fun, hilarious, and just makes me smile.
8:07  Step one: Open the ethereal door into the next realm.  Congratulations, you just escaped!
Not gonna lie, I thought the one girl was gonna do that thing from No Good Nick and she would grab the kidnapper’s wrist and flip them over, but it is much funnier that she just snapped his neck.
It's been 9 months since this video, troom troom might be worse now (make a new vid checking up on them plz)
I love the sims 3 music
This video had me crying, lmao 🤣 I loved how Nick kept pointing out the way easier solutions and oversights just, casually. Funniest part was how "subtle" Danny was when he was breathing in for the chair escape 🤣🤣🤣
You make me want to pee.
please send me a brand new tv
Question: do they have samsung phone cases?
is the background music…… the sims theme? this is all i can hear. i’ve never listened so hard in my life
In a real kidnapping situation, regardless of their gender, but mostly because she’s a girl, she would be getting raped and tortured. Troom Troom, this really isn’t cool.
“Fuck dude my Troom Troom life hack didn’t work!”
14:22 something about that made me laugh uncontrollably 😂
"im being kidnapped" the troom troom intro be like: dont care
Just get a otter box phone case. Once I was drunk and chilling on my balcony and I live on the 3rd floor and I dropped my phone and it survived without a single crack in the screen. I said and alot.
I think the girl getting the kidnappers a tv was supposed to be some wholesome moment in a sort of cartoonish way. These two brothers are kidnapping a rich girl (very badly at that) and holding her for ransom just because they’re broke and don’t have a tv. And when the girl escapes she sends them a tv in a sort of “you just had to ask :)” way. Still really dumb, but at least I think that’s the story they were trying to set down.
15:07 Jewish couples when they have a baby
your funni
13:56 free? Could one pay for said items? Asking for a friend of course
Nick is the nicest kidnapper I have ever seen (I have not seen a kidnapper but-)
troom troom needs to make some kidnapping life hacks.
GeTcHa gIrLy    -troom troom
is anyone going to talk about the socks the she was wearing lol
I wanna be the security guard watching these cameras lmao
Snapping necks dose kill people or paralyze them mainly kills poeple
16:38 "why is the mouth hole so big?" "i thought that's how big your mouth was!"
Regarding melting a zip tie with a match: I'm pretty sure Troom Troom took this from the real life case in which one of serial killer Bob Berdella's victims escaped using this method. However, the reason he was able to do this was because Bob Berdella had been sexually assaulting him for a long period of time and was deluded into believing that his victim was actually in love with him, so he became more lax in his restraints when he left for work. The reason the victim couldn't simply bend at the waist to pick up the match was because he was tied to a bed post. Naturally, Troom Troom wasn't going to include any of these disturbing details and wanted to present a sanitised version of kidnapping in which the victim is never in too much danger, so the context is lost and this tip seems really bizarre as a result. I imagine the rest of these tips are similar: Things that have been/could be legit avenues of escape in specific circumstances, but without those circumstances it just seems weird and useless.
Hey Greg’s
That’s last one was wild. I was sure it wasn’t gonna work.
3:52  Mommy long legs🚫 Really long legs✅
Did any of yall notice that at 3:12, it says Mar-in instead of Martin?
If you Snape someones neck they would die or be paralyzed
“While the attacker is stunned by your agility, tilt your seat back and Crush him”
This entire scenario is giving princess peach and bowser tbh 😭😭😭
It's really easy to crush someone with the seat of a Tesla, I do it all the time on accident. You just need a really small person to have a profile and the when anyone else drives, have that person get in with their phone first. As soon as the driver sits down, they'll start to get squashed.
The reason why she was able to escape his because it was a Ford that the kidnappers were driving and fords so as long as your kidnappers have kidnapped you in a ford there’s a good chance it will break down
the sims 3 cas music in the back
I almost chocked from laughing
I think troom troom started as a goofy account but is now 10000% in on the joke
Not Nick having to explain to Danny that the scratching sound from the match doesn’t mean it’s going to light
8:07 is it just my youtube or 1. does it glitch for everyone 2. do the robbers just have a print of themselves on their car?
1:42 CRUSH HIM
1.42 CRUSH HIM
I thought he was just joking when he asked Alexa for help. But why is there actually an Alexa in this random storage shed lmao
is no one gonna talk about the socks the girl in the "dungeon" wore? ...No? Okay
square knot jokes hehe  21:50 22:43
6:32 bro I almost spit juice out of my mouth
Welcome back on Detroit training whatever
The Kidnappers leaving you alone with matches happens more than you'd think, but less then you'd hope.
3:33 THAT IS NOT HER FOOT  THAT'S HER USING HER HAND (using what I think and hope is just a glove with the same pattern as the toesocks.) In that first shot they are using the toesocks from the looks of it to me, though it clearly did not light  In the next shot, it's just her hand, i'm pretty sure. Notice how all her 'toes' are now exactly the same size.
10:18 😳😳😳
arrivederci means goodbye in italian, that accent was pretty hilarious
video funni
Hello fellow Gregs
toe socks…..
"If you have a box of matches, you can think of a lot of games!"  What a wonderful thing to teach children: play with matches.
Wish this lady narrated Split tho.
Mmmmmm *Stockholm syndrome*
12:12 I doubt I can see the phonecase you’re advertising on your phone here 🤔 You’ve been wearing them and changing them every week… did you take it off just for this video ?
Time to rename the Stockholm Syndrome, I guess... Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the TroomTroom Syndrome...
When you’re wont steal a tv but you’ll steal a person
In these situations always remember, right over left , left over right
So...What you're saying you are will to show your bare feet on camera for a fee?
I don’t understand why the narrator is apparently a million people like what
i really appreciate the sims music in the back danny it was a good choice
yes, every kidnapper says gotcha girly!!! 😉 when they kidnap someone
6:15 that joke is the entire premise of the Adultswim show "Delocated" so it's not even original.
I hate troom troom
omg tht first girl hada sndyrome i forgot what it's called
The tape escape method also works for zipties. Including if your arms are bound behind your back, though it's more difficult. It's all about creating a sudden sharp motion which forces your wrists apart. Which makes the whole song and dance with the match really weird. Sure, you can melt plastic theoretically, but why?
9:44 "I'm not gonna try that on a real human person" - Drew Gooden
bro your so funny
Fun fact: arrivederci means “goodbye until we meet again”
I’m surprised they didn’t already know the duct tape trick, are they faking? And then that also works with zipties…
I actually liked troom troom when it made sense....
"If You're Kidnapped, Just Walk Away And Leave." -Danny (2021)
Why would the jail cell in the first hack be opened...
Watching him swing his arm like a sword for the tape hack was genuinely really hilarious l
every wattpad reader: OMG enemies to lovers type beat😍😍 i want thattttt
I think skylar is just kinky
The only lesson I learned from this video is.. Not to take drinks while watching Danny vids because I almost choked to death several times.
the narrators voice sounds like they're halfway through a voice crack
What if the voice over was a voice in their heads telling them to do these awful garbage video
The true life hack is to somehow get thousands let alone tens or hundreds of thousands to watch a troom troom video let alone take it seriously
1:31 what happened to hello? how are you? my name is?
I didn’t know CallMeKevin had a brother.
It was weird when u made the 'foot clit' socks...
he makes these videos for his friend greg, but its nice that you like them too, 🙂
I can't with Danny he always makes me laugh
“Gotcha gurlie! 😊🔪”
Danny: “Now I crush his bones” Nick: *moves slightly to the right*
Troom Troom going from silly to actually harmful
If I had a nickel for every time I saw a stupid video I would have 9999999£ i’m not joking I’ve seen so many dumb videos… help me that’s so bad
the beginning: ArE yOu GeTtInG sTranGleD👹
this narrators voice is literally unbearable to listen to. it's like she's trying her best to be annoying and irritating. I cannot watch the rest of the video without my ears starting to bleed.
The inhaling and tightening all your muscles does work to give you an inch or two of room. Ask anyone who's ever saddled a horse.
Wow
Did y’all not know you could rip duck tape?
13:26 if Batman was broke
That nick guy is the one that tried cancelling Manter. I hate him
Now thanks to this video those pesky kidnappers will duct tape the dog shit outta the kidnap-ee?!
6:00 it sounds like ur being held at gun point
THE NARRATORS VOICE IS SO SQUEAKY TO THE POINT IT'S ACTUALLY INFURIATING 😭
9:07 so were just going to ifnore the naked manican???
Horses do the inhale thing when being saddled. That's why you ALWAYS tighten the girth immediately before mounting.
jojo reference
This video was hilarious I was laughing the whole way through.
I tried the duck tape thing and it actually worked. Tried it on my brother and his arm got waxed
THE WINK🤣 21:45
HANG ON THE TAPE DOES BREAK EASILY???
This video helped me not get muged once tank you
I absolutely love that nick prbably still didn’t understand Danny calling guns criminals until the video was uploaded
About the scarf I think it was smart cuz they might still strangle you it’s the back of you’re shirt it would almost impossible to escape
Troom-troom giving you trauma-trauma since 2021!
thats why you hog tie em
9:10 bruno buccellati after beating the shit out of pesci
I like how she sees the trap and just starts taking selfies with it
danny and his tesla awhh
This narrator sounds like my therapist.
20:10 literally a dad answer. can’t change my mind.
Why does Danny remind me of Steve Harrington from stranger things
11:16 or you can peel of The tape from ur mouth and pull tape off with ur teeth.
10:12 to *CRUSH HIM*
Good to know that I need to use something other then zip ties and duck tape for my victims. Thank You Danny.
For anyone wondering, The Modern Rogue has a bunch of great videos going over actually good techniques (and some shitty techniques) for hiding contraband and escaping a kidnapping
Whoever narrates these troom troom videos has the most god-awful voice
This video was how I found you,brings back memories 🥺
Her voice makes me wanna end it all
9:07 IS NO ONE NOTICING THE S*X DOLL IN THE BACK????????!?!?!?
Jojo reference⁉️⁉️😨😨
Basically nick with his beanie "Narancia!"
24:47 when you notice the hand
Wait a minute... Have I discovered my true calling?
Describing the criminal: he has like...bl...a gun metal grey face👀
I like that u get to watch danny realize he’s Actually being choked.
I'm pretty sure those are safety matches. You need a matchbox to ignite them. Non-safety matches can be lit on pretty much anything dry, as long as the surface has any sort of rough texture. I haven't watched the whole video; I'm sure I'll be shown to be wrong in the next few minutes
this was funny as fuck dude
I love when nick’s hair goes through the eyeholes in the “mask” and it’s like he has little buns lmao
The sucking in your chest actually does work bc my bro tied me to a tree and that helped me get loose.
Yes Danny yes that kills people.
i hate when im in the middle of kidnapping someone for ransom and then i have to go to a quinceañera. it's so annoying.
better title: 365 days: kid edition
Even with a mask Danny is easily recognisable
Why is there a random hand at 24:50?!
What is mind blowing to me is that these two boys, as well as the camera person were never part of the era of the internet freaking out over the breaking out duct tape hack
Troon Troom is undermining the dangers of being kidnapped, they are fucking bullshit
Stockholm syndrome in a nutshell
serial killer boyfriend back at it again
9:38 tried on Brother it makes people stop moving entirely, even their heart, which is funny
Thanks to this video, one of my favorite ways to say goodbye is "arrivederci, loser"
Upset they didnt teach me how to break my thumb ligiment
the door of the car has a bandets texter???
I want to keep watching the video with that girl's voice might just make my ears bleed
That narrator voice is gonna make me jump out of a window on the 69th floor
I NEED more danny and nick collabs
I worked as a detention officer for a cupple years. At the jail, inmates actually push air into there body so they can take off retrains faster and cause trouble. Second one works I you don't pay attention.
"For free"
Stop kink shamming
Wait so... These guys presumably took someone hostage, got an X BOX OUT OF IT AND DIDN'T THINK THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TV?
i’m watching this again at work and my boss just walked behind me while danny was trying to light a match with his toes
20:09 lmfao
When I was held Hostage for 8 hours at gunpoint when i finally fought back and got ahold of the hostage taker i tried to break his neck after i fought him for the gun and in the tussle got a hold of a screwdriver and stabbed him in the neck and chest and when he was down i tried to finish it and i couldn't get his neck to break. well his neck broke the cops said a few hours after they took him away they found fractures in the xray at the hospital.
Is it just me or does the narrator sound like missy from big mouth?
“Pull the seat backwards to *CRUSH HIM* “ I was laughing so much
The Door wasn't locked her feet weren't tied she literally could have gotten up and walked out lmao
This is how I found out Danny Gonzalez Channel this video
I'm always getting strangled, but that's probably because of my t-shirt that says STRANGLE ME, PLEASE!
the kidnappers' masks remind of me of catwoman's in the batman lol. borderline useless
I feel like its a bit of a catch-22 Danny it smarter than you🫵
In fairness I would send them a tv too and if they were that nice to me or that incompetent to essentially let me leave
11:00 as you throw the seat back, they can hold both ends of the velcro and you’re gonna get strangled frfr.
Snapping someones neck in the way she is doing it will very likely kill someone. The issue is the location on the spine. Generally, snapping a specific area of the spine results in, from lowest part of spine to the top, 1) no paralysis (lower parts such as directly above the coccyx), 2) leg-down paralysis 3) neck-down paralysis, 4) full paralysis or 5) death. Death mostly occurs when you break the top-most vertebrae, such as if a massive brown bear were to step on your neck. The vertebrae are so high up that you’re either fully paralyzed or you’d be dead very quickly, between seconds and minutes. Snapping the spinal cord will sever the connection between the brain and body, thus, both start to die.
Am I the only person who saw the mannequin of the naked woman during the chain hack- 💀
That's what you get for not paying Nick for his fragrance influencer course
It's this one of those pretend you don't know it's a joke things?
Top tier vid. 💝
im being kidnapped of course im not ok ;)
8:30 9:07 yo what in the bottom left floor tho
Nick looks a bit too happy
ok i tried the ducktape thing. it didnt work so uh yeah idk
the english troom troom voice is even worse than the german one
8:35 i think this was the only valid tip troom troom has ever given
"Oh my god, get out of my throat.."    *That's what she said*
Can't suffer from kidnapping IF IM NOT ALIVE TO SUFFER FROM IT 💡💡💡
wait is the camera guy christian from peachy babies slime
"You're tied up with scotch tape. PERFECT!" -troom troom
Bruh I melted a zip tie then it melted on my arm
Arrivederci is a formal way of saying “bye”. You use it for people you’re not familiar with or with more authority than you, for example a cashier, a waitress or a teacher :>
“Looks like [the kidnapper] has a little crush 😏” HOLY SHIT. WHAT IS THIS SCRIPT
21:15   Some of the best content I’ve seen in years 😂😂😂 Hack #2 had be laughing hard
The kidnapping video is clearly just them doing a bdsm scene.
ngl if i was to kidnap someone, i dont think i would skimp on the duct tape hahaha
< 0:30 looks a lot like my rabbit, I’m impressed👍
Funny thing is they haven't sold strike anywhere matches since the early 2000s 😂😂😂😭
I haven’t laughed this hard in eons. 😂
dude in one of the shots she brings her toe sock up to her face- how flexible is this woman?
Are you kidnapper Spider-Man rippof
Well they may save your life or just get you slaughtered
If a kidnapper falls in love with the person they kidnapped, would that be “reverse” Stockholm syndrome?
mickey mouse voice- "gotcha girly"
KIDNAPPING! YES! AN INCREDIBLY FUN THING TO DO! (To fictional characters, not to real people)
It means "until we meet again" huh
Troom Troom needs to be stopped-
wait, im new, why greg?
The troom troom narrators voice was so irritating.
I have thought about it and you should just lick the duck tape.
It’s even funnier that Nick wasn’t there to understand the references
10:30 this one is stupid because all kidnappers will use their own chain to choke you so….yeah
What the actual fuck
Danny u are very funny but not angry but I know ur secret
Instructions unclear I now have a ski mask glued to my foot
"great job martin!           thats a felony!"  that got me and i dont know why
i like your sweater
I can't believe troom troom put the sock over their hands to strike the match, and lift it to their face. Channels like that make YouTube more of a joke LOL
its ari-vi-del-chi
Dear mr. Gonzalez may I recommend you to react to the movie smellivill
9:11 let’s talk about the naked life sized mutilated Barbie in the background
Troom troom's narrator's voice fills me with an intense rage I never knew I had
"For free for you sickos" theres a paid option?
I choked on my buffalo chicken dip multiple times during this video, thank you
giving them tv was a good thing, now they won't kidnap anyone else
Funny good inspriational perfect
9:40 it dos noteng you chen not twist somoans head like thes
Make a review on the movie 'GOAT Story'
6:49 Yk, I gotta respect Troom Troom drawing their own TV with MK11 on it, that's pretty funny. My two favourites, Raidan and Lu Kang, hopefully they don't run into Crownika or Show Can.
*im being kidnapped!* *ARE YOU BEING STRANGLED?*
I've seen that duct tape life hack also used to break zip ties. Only you're supposed to do it standing and kind of against your hip.
they're legally not allowed to chase you. im dying
Ah he’s back
So many criminals
The duck tape one also works for zip ties
Video tutorial on how to get Stockholm Syndrome
Video property of Ernie gang.
Great work Danny!!! Im tyo drunk to writhe more.... But it was prtty dark...
If you're getting kidnapped, Give them permission! It's not kidnapping if you let them take you away.
Lighting a match with your foot is very dangerous, you could light your socks on fire
EW SHE HAS SOCKS WITH TOES THOSE ARE AWFUL WHY IS THAT A THING PEOPLE OWN 3:09
🎵GIVE ME YOUR- G- G- GET IN THE CARRR🎵
These Troom Troom videos make Detroit urban survival training look like experts
When they choke you push or pull your seat down.🍜
Your face @ 7:18 was almost exactly what I was doing at that same moment and I couldn't help but burst out laughing
"That's a felony." Me: (Almost spits out tea during breakfast) 😂
They’re fucking saying to play with matches that’s like number 0NE rule that your parents say NOT to do
is this a jojo part 5 refrence??? \\
R2-D2 23:09
Don't think that troom troom is good with everything just because of this video.  They probably watched another video on YouTube to get most of the things to do.  I already knew most of the ones that worked.
The duct tape one works with zip ties too!
6:50 he do be playin as raiden in mk11
“Im not gonna show my feet *for free* for you sickos”
Argh eev ih derr chee! lmfao I feel very sorry for my Italians in the audience.
The trick you were testing with the duct tape is pretty solid. I've broken a zip tie with it.
The tape thing works more commonly with Zip-ties, I know this cause my someone tried to teach me how to not be kidnapped and wouldn’t let me cut the zip-ties until I was able to break them
As soon as he said, "CRUSH HIM!" a massive boom came from thunder.
Dude, I'm eating
I was crying this whole video 😂
no one:   the narrator: ✨Gotcha Girlie✨ 💅💅💅🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗☺️☺️☺️😌😌😌😌😌😌
24:24 why just why
Lisa Mcvey and a lot of other kidnapping survivors have actally done the breathing hile being tied up thing
8:28 anyone who gets the reference deserves a veterans discount
the voice in troom troom sounds like Missy from Big Mouth.
I haven’t even finished the video and I know the duct tape one is true because I’ve done it before I mean I tested it out I wasn’t kidnapped
21:55 it's a knot you tie you fckin square
yws
The “gotcha girly” sounds like Mickey Mouse
If a murderer is gonna kill you, kill him!!!!!!!!!!!
I know how to unlock a car door without using the car key
the narrator also said “our” victim 😭
The grabbing the chin and the back of the head thing is so laughable. As if somebody is going to choke you standing up and put their face right next to yours for easy access.
Don’t breathe in, just tense up and make yourself as big as possible
Nick staring at Danny walking to the car and saying “I love when he wears that scarf” is so fucking funny I wish they collaborated more bc this was so good lmao
I had captions on and when Alexa spoke the captions said music and that had me laughing for a good 5 minutes
My ex bf kidnapped me 2 years ago. FYI troom troom being kidnapped is extremely traumatizing and not just a hangout sesh between buds or a fun escape game
17:33
13:08
"Gimme your.... self! I guess... I'm a kidnapper not a robber"
10:47
2 M9s on the wall and says: "nah, I'll cover myself in a blanket"
the girl for the first video her voice is really high sounds like if you put the pitch up for a tomodachi life character
I know the duct tape hack works for zip ties but what you do is raise you hand up and pull down hard into your stomach so i could see it also working for duck tape
This video had me in tears LMAOO
Ah yes kidnapping hacks! Hacks for napping kids
The duct tape one works but u have to hit it against your stomach
the sims 3 create a sim music is making my fight or flight response go off
Troom Troom is indeed Ukrainian and they are STILL putting out content. You have to respect that.
I love the fact that there’s a very enthusiastic and joyful voice narrating someone literally experiencing a life or death situation
This guys humor😂😂
That DnB Sony at 19:30 was banging
Thanks Again Troom Troom! This has really helped me iron out some of the flaws in my attempts!👍
first time that i had a fit of laughter only because of a thumbnail xD
I don't think this guy heard of virtual pc's
God the voice person is the most annoying thing I’ve ever heard
can i just say that i HATE the new troom troom narrator's voice? it feels like chewing glass to listen to
WHY IS THE PART OF HIM CUTTING THE HAT SO FUNNY IM ACTUALLY CRYING
If the scarf has velcro then when the kidnapper pulls on it it will rip
You can easily break zip ties on your knee
11:22 If you are tied up with some sort of tape, Straighten your arms, pretend there is a wall behind you, try to smack that wall and also when you are being tied up make sure your wrists are touching
Amazing, I died laughing during this.
The narrators voice makes my head hurt. Never heard of troom troom before and now I know to avoid it like covid.
really funny that both the parents and babies are wearing ski masks at the photo at 6:00, too bad it is about as origional as Amy Schumer's "jokes"
If the breath trick doesn't work, just shit your pants. it'll deflate your stomach and make you just a bit thinner.
I'm sick rn but I kept laughing so everytime k laughed while watching this I just felt a huge pain in my stomach as if I was gonna die lol
the troom troom narrator makes me sick to listen to
5:58, I thought the parents were the brothers for a second there lol
9:39 so i just tried that on myself... it will just pop your neck (keep in mind i did it a bit gently). but also if you do it hard i think it could at least hurt someone
If you escape in less than five minutes your legally skilled
3:35 wait that's a hand. she just put that sock on her hand
“Since when are criminals good at arts and crafts.” ….. hitler
“Crime should be rewarded.” ~Troom Troom
watching this was just just painful.
The only good one is the “scotch tape” one
Lmao, i can't with his sarcasm.
jeez more like "how to be calm while kidnapped"
an actual hack: call 911
i think the best part was the budding romance between the kidnapper and the victim
for some weard resion my wifi cut out, and when it did i could't exit full screen. But it was slowly zoming in on your face and it stopped on your nose.
Looked like you had black panties on your face lol
no free feet... got it. whats your onlyfans?
9:19 this can actually work and snap their neck. You twist and pull
I’m so mad at the fact that this wasn’t called Trying Troom Trooms Terrible Kidnapping Tricks
Funniest stuff I’ve seen in while
Pov your name is greg
hold on, lemme just pull out my phone to watch some of these life hacks rq
in the first one the door isnt even locked. you can just beeline for it your dont need to really do anything else
"Before we get on how to escape being kidnapped, this video is sponsored by RAID SHADOW LEGENDS"
Who's Greg? , I'm not Greg.
her mispronounces arriveradici the italian kidnappers you just made me even more pissed
22:15 danny becomes a god at life hacks he then frees all the souls that have been kiddnaped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         spaghetti
her voice is the definition of a voice crack while hitting the high note
YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT GOTCHA HACKS ITS TROOM TROOM 2.O
her voice god damn
someone actually named greg
Bro my Alexa went off too and it was at the exact same time lmao
When I clicked I thought I’m gonna get lifehacks on kidnapping people
who even wheres a scarf, 120 degrees isnt THAT cold
duct tape is actually easy to break with your hands
The voice in the video’s has changed and it’s so fucking annoying
Psych actually has an episode with kidnapping survival tips - I'd recommend those before any of this insane shit.
Breaking someone's neck can actually kill them.
24:41  The Riddler 2022
Danny in the mask lookes like budget batman. All I thought was dununununu nununununu BATMAN
5 stars would recommend to a nearby victim
Is it really that hard for other people to pick things up with their toes? I’be always been able to do it
danny: doesn’t realize he has to cut off the  tip of the glue me: troom trooms rubbing off on him
The ill-fitting ski mask is the best part of this whole video 😂
That was Randy from south park in the two days before the day after tomorrow episode 😭
I can’t take the narrator’s voice seriously! 😂😂😂
imagine being the camera guy who has to film Danny getting choked
Danny circumcised a bottle of glue 😟
The way he put an emergency alarm when he started coughing
Interesting that it's always a woman getting kidnapped or assaulted by a man or men. Very interesting
Are we not going to talk about the doll at 9:11
13:02  Task failed successfully
9:10 STICKY FINGERS
9:20
As a person who has actually been kidnapped and this video is 100% accurate
hello
Danny: “what does aeryvodoichi mean” JoJo fans: -TRIGGERED-
Man’s be looking like Batman
What
If you don't put that much force into it then you were not break their neck but it would like really feel uncomfortable
You know some times I wish the world ran on troom-troom logic
This is my favorite video he has ever posted
4:49 tobey miguire
If you actually are in the trunk of a car kick the corner to break the back light someone will pull them over and then you can scream for heeeeeeeeelp
im late to watching this. I still have a very pressing question. What kind of matches were those?
"Hi Greg, yes you read the story right: I am trying Troom Troom life hacks."  ......Sigh........    Call the funeral parlour. I'll hit the mausoleum.
There’s always an Alexa dude
I remember being taught the motion to break hand restraints when I was younger. (It also works with zip ties Danny!!!!) Is that not common knowledge?
Its called Stockholm Syndrome
Nobody noticing the doll at 9:07
TBH Troom Troom is just making strange fetish / kid content fusion videos to get as much revenue without actual morality at all
You looked like a chad wearing that skii mask.
Every time you make troom trooms videos a meme I laugh historically
Not me laughing at the match against the wall “hack”. They’re called “safety matches” for a reason - because they can only be lit from being struck against the box, and not by being struck against just any surface.
14:38 it's at this point, where Danny Gonzalez goes off the rails.
ok but why does the narrator sound different
5:03 I mean, she's not wrong, the entire room is purple which is why it's full of ርዪጎጠጎክልረነ
He said he wouldn’t expose his toes for FREE!!
just open the car window, easy. there’s a little door on the window. what do you think the window is for? to look out? no it’s a handle to get out of the window. step out and just walk on air. shrink to fit in you need.
9:00 but danny you forgot something                 you dont have any friends to tie you up
WAIT IS TROOM TROOM FUCKING ITALIN OMFG???
Ngl Danny kinda pulls off that scarf with the frog shirt
At 9:40 yes, if you feel as if you're in real danger you can resort to snapping their neck although sometimes it doesn't actually"snap" their neck. My oldest brother would pop his neck by doing what the girl did and hasn't hurt himself, but it can leave the attacker disoriented (because y'know you think you just DIED.)
Surprisingly enough some of it would actually be a teensy whitney little bit useful
13:36
The way I laughed out loud REALLY loudly while my whole family was asleep when danny said “time to crush his bones” because of how slowly he started reclining  backwards
Arrivederci, Greg!
WHY IS THE NARRATOR IN THE FIRST VIDEO SO FUCKING ANNOYING, WHAT IS THAT?!
Here a real tip for getting out of a car. A lot of cars seem to have an “antikidnapping” mechanism. For example the back of my car have a yellow pull with a note to pull to escape
I like the fact that "the kidnappers" have playstation pillows, and Xbox controllers and idk what console to supposedly play video games  Edit: the troom troom vids kinda have a weird vibe especially cuz i believe that they are aimed at kids...oof
The way they describe how to get out of chokehold is literally how I was taught to literally break someone’s neck. Like that’s how you’re trained to break a neck. 30 pounds of force in one quick motion and it turns their eyes on the back of their head.
How do people not know that duct tape (and all tape) is made to be cut like that. By just ripping it. That’s what it was made for scissors was never supposed to be used for tape. So troom troom finally got something right
Can we talk about how weird the narrator sounds? Her voice like cracks and gets higher and lower throughout the entire video.
“Thanks for kidnapping me, best I’ve been taken captive in a while; here’s a TV!! ☺️☺️😉😘😜”
Arriverderci means goodbye in italian
Literally thought the kidnappers were part of a skit featuring kurtis conner in the red shirt lmfao
guys what if you lick the tape so it unsticks from your mouth? its foolish but better than troom troom
That moment when he cuts open the beanie to make a mask and basically reveals his entire face. 🤣
3:10 no comment
well last year i was actually kidnapped and the door was unlocked and i just got out 👁👁 sadly the car didn't break down, it was moving fast but well anyways good kidnapping hack
Shout out to our boy Nick, who nearly choked Danny out because he trusted Troom Troom's survival hacks!
The narrator isn't on their side.  She *is* them  That's supposed to be them speaking  It's somehow so much worse
“ Gimme yourself “
I love toe socks!!! #1 survival tip!
I kinda wanna be bestfriends with danny
In a cutesy voice: Are u getting strangled? Teehee:)  Lost it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gun’s don’t hurt people PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE HAHAHA
The duct tape thing is real but troom troom did a terrible job of explaining it as they do.
I like how the criminals have a ps5 but no TV-checks online- yep.... TV is cheaper
Also, it should be pronounced arebbeDEREchi.
Troom troom failed to mention that they had to be strike anywhere matches. That's why they had green tips.
“To lore them to to think they can strangle you” Welp,one less kidnapper. *Someone snaps a kidnappers neck* (That can kill someone) IRL:Welp,one less kidnapper.
I DESPISE the goddamn narrators voice  God, it sounds so unnatural i want to throw bricks at it
I just realized she walked out of the dungeon without unlocking it the handcuffs were useless
I actually did learn the duct tape trick in a legit self-defense talk.
"Is the next life hack to shoot the kidnappers?"
Hey cool, I usually have sticks and/or leaves in my hair. But I don't look like some celebrity Billy person, more homeless and crawled out ov a bush.
22:12 DANNYS GIGGLE hahahahah oh my god this video is too funny
Ngl, that Nick guy, he is not green.
so we're not gonna talk about the socks she was wearing?... okay
9:15 The strong American accent during the pronunciation killed me
“Gawd, get out of my throat.”  R.I.P. my sides 💀
“What does arreverderci mean?” JoJo Fans: Allow us to introduce ourselves
4:29 is that fucking gm_construct
4:47 KILLED ME 😂😂
bro i "CRUSHED" that subscribe button....your welcome! heh your never gonna see my comment anyway so.....yeah....
The word arrivederci apparently means into we meet again
Is nobody noticing how that the first hack with the “toe socks” was literally just the girls hand and the clip was two different cuts
show the feet, coward.
"If you have a box of matches, you can think of so many games!" is the funniest thing I've ever heard in a children's video
0:22  that aint no kidnapper, thats just the abyss that surrounds the universe looking for its existence tax   or its the irs who have come to steal your toes for not paying your existence tax
Be careful with the fire!
Why does the evil hideout have a Alexa wtf
No way anyone will read this but with the whole breathing in and tensing when being tied up thing it's generally more helpful to bear down on your diaphragm like you're straining on the toilet but without the lower abdominal muscles (if you struggle to do this taking a big breath and then exhaling while holding the tension can help) and tense up so that you can still actively breathe because 1) it's super apparent if you're holding your breath and it's easy to force someone to exhale by hitting them and 2) holding your breath is super unsustainable and it's easy to just end up exhaling. Your breathing will be more shallow while you're bearing down on your diaphragm but it'll expand your chest sufficiently and will typically change your posture enough to make you larger. I've tested this method sufficiently to know that it'll work well enough to escape in an emergency.  Quick edit: Also if you're ever holding your breath for some reason not to puff out your cheeks, you want that air to be in your lungs so your lungs can get as much oxygen out of that air as possible. Even if you puff them out when you start to feel uncomfortable there's still some oxygen in that air and it can be useful to help you sustain a breath hold
I cannot finish this video because the narrator's voice is so grating to my ears GOD DAMN IT
Won't someone end Mar'en's reign of terror?
It wols
I watched this the day before my 32nd surgery and it takes a laugh and this absolutely killed me, it was so funny omg!
Emily grabs his neck and, f-ing kills the guy! She is now free! AREVIRDERCHI LOOSERS
Now seems like as good a time as any to say that if you’re having fun with restraints at home, you NEED: 1. A partner or partners you trust who can free you if needed 2. A way to signal if you need to be freed like a safeword or a nonverbal signal if you can’t speak (like for example if you’re being strangled with a tear away scarf) 3. A pair of those nifty scissors with an angle and a little guard; they sell them for cutting off casts in a medical setting as well as for cutting off ropes in an adult fun time setting
11:50 Yes.
Why do I find the Sims 3 music at the beginning so distracting?
16:28 criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal
this  girl has stockholmsyndrome
Not to defend sir troom troom or anything but i would DEFINITELY k¡ll my captor if i could
26:36 dancing danny
'Ew" Nick says -  Danny with the most evil grin I've seen in my life. "You like that?"
I can’t get over how awful the narrator sounds. She reminds me of those terrible girl impressions you hear some guys try to pull off
21:41 my 11 year old cousin when I made him made. He used to growl. He was weird.
"Is this written by kidnappers¿" I almost spit out my ramen
I love these kidnapping hacks! Now I know how to kidnap people successfully!
Skylar:they tried to put me on the cover of voge but my legs were to long
I love how the only life hack that actually works is the “scotch tape” hack, that isn’t even a troom troom hack it’s already like a thing, troom troom just stole it lol
Danny doesn't even know how funny he is
I kind of wanna strangle that person doing the ridiculous narrator voice. (This is a joke)
The fact that YouTube allows channels like groom troom to exist is ridiculous.
-and      *CRUSH THEM*
The duct tape thing actually works if you know how to do it,,, it's kinda cool
If you're being kidnapped, just tell them you didn't tell someone you loved them, they're legally required to take you home.
Ok heres the thing just lock the car at night so they dont come in your care😳💢
*danny starts choking on beanie fluff* *cuts to a flashback of that one demonic bunny hole puncher getting fur riggedy EVERYWHERE*
Rewatching this and I just realized that the background music he uses in the beginning is the Sims 3 Create-a-Sim music.... now I literally can't focus on what he's saying LOL
this gotta be the most kinkiest video dannys ever made
Using that family pic of the Criminals *not guns* as my header for everything
If you think about it people have to be watching them because they’re doing this in public places and I doubt they have the budget to have a green screen
I saw that duct tape trick on the news when I was probably about 8 years old. I only remember because I ran around the house looking for duct tape later so I could try it 😅
the actual shock from when the duct tape back worked made this video so much better for me- plus yayyy nick collab!!
6:49 they want a TV but they literally have a ps5 controller with  means they have a ps5🤣
Let's be real, a kidnapper would not kidnap you if your, fat, ugly, or act like a crackhead
His background music is the sims 3 theme- It took me a moment to realize that
It's the fact that everyone in all of Danny's vids look 20 something but they're like, 30 yr olds. Really making us question our mortality huh, Danny?
Trying troom-troom’s anti-kidnapping tips is like Detroit urban survival training
I love the casual “Are you getting strangled?” in a super cheerful voice
whats the point of kidnapping someone if they dont easily escape and then give u a tv
"aah he's back" lol
the look on the girl's face when she let the seat back
7:17 ,9:06 - 9:38, and 9:54 - 10:25 are my favorite parts
is that sims 4 music in the beginning ?
0:29 - no YOU  made this: give them credit for atleast the fact that their one was actually cute(though it still sucked as a "practical tool")
The fact that the duct tape one could actually save someone is insane
“She’s so pretty, so charming and graceful” “It’s obvious that he’s in love with her.”  what kind of reverse stockholm syndrome is this
Nick is taller than Danny????????
Damn it. It’s too late to straighten myself.
dies of cringe
thats a pretty sick Femto cosplay
13:06 is when he starts choking-
when danny called for alexa, mine activated too. didnt help that i was home alone
Stokhome syndrome
Scotch Tape Escape sounds like a type of icecream
i feel like this is an accurate representation of Danny actually getting kidnapped
"Are you getting strangled?" Funny that you ask, yes I am getting strangled right now.
13:26  shitty spiderman knock off
"Give me your ....  self."
The door looks weird…
the music sounds like a frickin fresnitc files episode  Edit: what did I say God lol💀☠💀☠💀💀☠💀☠💀☠☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀☠☠💀💀☠💀☠☠💀☠💀☠💀☠☠💀
11:47 English people saying italian words is so ridiculous, that's not how u say "Arrivederci" wich means bye
i laughed so much during this that it literally hurts to breathe now
That Troom Troom kidnapper in the red shirt looks like Kurtis Conner
"I just need some chains and ropes... and a friend to tie me up" out of context sounds a lil bit odd......
5:15 omg so many criminals
11:34
27:16 we were all thinking "really danny" 💀
Martin & Kevin playing Cancer Combat X
No one  Absolutely no one in the world  Danny Gonzalez: Get out of my throat!!!
0:22 4:48 5:04 9:10 10:09
Better Do Some Mad magic
Heart hmartttt Garth shns fart
Hehehehehe I will defo use these tips when I get kidnapped… 🙂🙃 GREG FOREVER!
23:49 why does Danny look like a greninja?
watching this is destroying my last brain cell
This is definitely me when I get kidnapped
L
E
17:15 It means he really is a psycho kidnapper xd
Danny didn't wanna get burnt from hot glue but now he is gonna get burnt by us for not knowing how to use fabric glue xd
Intro got me high
Danny and Nick are the perfect YouTube combo
12:46 BORN to be a criminal, that Danny. 😂
R.I.P "this video is over now" outro song
the narrator sounds like they're on- um- substances
9:36 freeze frame-
not lip from shameless
didn’t miss the sims 3 music danny
“You don’t get to see my feet for free you sickos”  Danny what do you mean *for free*
the ending really got me
Can't believe Danny collabed with someone like Nick he has a bunch of subs
Danny doesn't even begin talking about the naked mannequin in the background 9:07
12:43 so who’s gonna make that a song?
man sais its 11 pm when its acauly 11 pm  (23:05)
I love the crafting corner sign.
9:07 anyone else notice the naked mannequin cut in half in the background? 💀
Holy shit is that narrator ANNOYING
Criminals are gunss got me djdjfhehwheheahaha
17:32 *aaaaaaaaaaaä*
What do they give the troom troom actors to be able to act that way for these long videos. Coke or pixie Stix like for pagent toddlers?
me when russian registered daewoo lanos
0:22 u go to brazil
the chian one actually works i tried it with my rists
9:25 This actually works. It doesn't kill the person, it just causes them extreme pain. If you're facing the person, put the palm of your hand under their chin with your wrist facing them. Then push up as hard as you can, this will cause pain and the natural human response to pain is to hold the area that hurts. The persons hands will go to cradle their neck and you will be able to run. 10:00 Do not do this, just turn around. It will release the pressure on your windpipe and you will be able to breathe. Do not go for the chokehold, turn around and go for the eyes.
I love this video so much
Ok so, the scarf thing… if you’re wearing a scarf (from the “hack”) you can escape yea, if you’re not wearing the scarf they can just use their hands/arms so… i think troom troom has a point        PS: i still hate troom troom
Are u being strangled? Good
Are u TIED UP in skotch tape? Yes? GOOD!
I want to switch my skin with dannys
Danny, I'm sorry to inform you. You have already exposed Greg to your feet in your video: "Wrong Sock :/".
I feel so bad for danny he has to do it😭
"I did it perfectly wrong, it seems." Danny Gonzalez, 2021.
Well, breathing in should help if being tied to a tree.
Wow these kidnappers are hard core virgins they only kidnap women
Nick is hilarious
So impressed that Danny rented out a garage just for us for this video.
17:33 best part!
14:39 You realize that's what needle and thread are for, do you?
I looked really stupid laughing out loud. Damn you, Danny.
this was the first ever video i wtched of yours
The automatic seat part KILLLEDDD MEEE
I cannot believe how funny this was 😂
when I saw the title I immediately assumed that troom troom was trying to teach tricks to kidnappers
we gonna talk about that mannequin at 9:08 or what
Hey uh the duck tape trick is a good way to break your wrists
Imagine playing in front of a carboard TV with a PS5 controller to emphasize how poor you are.
24:44
NICKISNOTGREEN???? :o
Danny looks like Philip from shameless a bit ,not that ,that’s a bad thing
Omg i didnt Find ur youtube  chanel in years  and i finally found u again
I was using this as background noise and for like thirty seconds I thought he edited the narrators voice in because of how much it sounds like Ralph from the Simpsons    I'm in danger
They have chains!
@12:44 Arriva dirchi!
Right over left, left over right
21:24
“It’s the type of knot you’d tie you fucking square.” - Danny Gonzalez
Why would you stop at 3 layers?! My mind was BLOWN. Now I gotta bind myself and break out to prove that I'm a man
The narrator's voice is giving me several forms of cancer and aids
the “i’M bEiNg KiDnApPeD!1!” immediately followed by the troom troom intro song SENT ME 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
“Since when are criminals good at arts and crafts?” *Hittler: am I a joke to you?*
11:11 got me weak. “No its duct tape. Its duct tape its not scotch tape.” The pure confusion on his face is chefs kiss
Lame dungeon. You’re so funny, thanks.
We have the update corner The crafting corner And the war corner What will the 4th corner be…
My family helped me with trying the duct tape one. I got 7 layers on my wrist because my family thought that that would be the minimum that a kidnapped would apply. I had my arm hair ripped out as I struggled.
Love ur vids but this one made me laugh the HARDEST
“i feel like i was choking you for a while there” - “yeah you WERE” 😭
My trying to escape my kidnappers after YouTube removed the dislike button.
why is this so funny 21:48
15:25
still surprised that danny didn’t film this in his murder basement
Wait who's recording
Guns don't kill people, bullets do
I have seen this so many times, but I was in a bad mood and seeing these two together had me laughing and joyful. 10/10 Danny and Nick are the greatest pair! (Sorry One Topic and Click! Bromance over Romance, I can't help it)
i cant stop laughing 😭
Did you happen to give Nick a tv?
0:22 i like how the voice is so relaxed and calm while the lady is screaming her diaphragm out
this is my ultimate comfort video
19:47 I love how a quinceanera was the only long commitment nick could think of
I haven’t tried this but I feel like scotch tape would actually be harder to break than duct tape because the duct tape is being ripped with the grain and scotch doenst have a grain so it has less weak points
4:59
your hair is still so way overdone and terrible..........mark this guy up as a contributor to depleting the ozone layer
"Catch it Girlie!" Best sentence from a kidnapper.
The beginning was a bit long and not great but I’m happy I stayed for the trying that part was absolutely hilarious
Why is no one talking about the fact the narrator sounds high as fuck
the duct tape thing is a legitimate tactic used with real survival trainers.
Nick is having way too much fun choking Danny.
"Look at all of those criminals 😰😱"
Arrivederci losers
Trying troom troom. Hmmmm t.t.t
Funny thing is that its always two men kidnapping one girl…
The title says may save your life so ppl can't sue troom troom
I was teaching my cousin and her friend how to do the duct tape hack and my cousins friends kept doing it wrong and she kept saying it didn’t work so I did it and she was like “what?!” So I taught her how to do it
I haven’t laughed this hard at a Youtube video in such a long time, thanks Danny😂❤️
rewatching this video i just now realised how weird it is for danny to just be quoting troomtroom with his friends having no clue as to what he is even talking about, not only that he probably watched those videos a week before he met up with his friends and he just remembers random quotes from them and just keeps saying them confusing his friends.
The scarf one looked weird
The duck tape one was so cool
At 5:24 I fully expected Danny to explain that the man threatened him with the criminal he was holding
that duck tape breaking hack is also supposed to work with zipties- when there's one around both wrists, not like in the troom troom video- as long as you put the closing part of it in between your wrists. i've never tried it but the source seemed legit and it didn't seem edited.
I laughed so much watching this! Thanks, Danny!
Being Mexican I seriously doubt this would help, you can't really be quirky and smart when you're in a trash bag, cut into pieces like a grilled chicken.
There’s absolutely no way that troom troom is serious. They GOTTA be satire
The lady in the troom troom videos makes me want to hold a flash bang to my ear so they don’t work anymore.
The tape one is actually pretty accurate, duck tape rips under pressure. You gotta cross your wrists tho.
troon troom’s advice: When all else fails, break their fucking neck.
UHHhhhh there is a nakid manekin women
Danny: Kidnapping is okay, but killing the kidnappers to escape is way too far man
Who knew nick was the riddler this whole time
6:55
may be the real kidnapping was all the friends we made along the way
"Are you tied up with scotch tape?" "Nah it's duck tape"
One of the most dangerous things in the video was when the black fuzzies were suffocating Danny
her legs weren't even tied up she didn't have to just slide her shoe off, she wasn't even tied to a chair
The thing is kidnappers watched this video and now these life hacks are useless
The duck tape thing you have to pull apart and pull down at an angle use your knee or something
I think I lost some brain cells in this one. I would bet $50 you could have just pulled those zip ties apart lol.
Find yourself a partner that treats you the way Troom Troom kidnappers treat their captives
I love how there were crutches behind them on this part 31:16
Arevaderchi losers me is that a jojo reference
Troom Troom: Are you being strangled? Danny: Yeah :/
yeah the duct tape isnt troom trooms idea that's actually from other ppl and duct tape is made to be able to rip like that
6:40 we want tv Also 10 seconds ealier: playing ps5 that needs TV
Why is mickey mouse voicing this whole video
9:48 yes you could potentially kill someone if you do that but to do it you would need to do it in a certain position but it's also used to help crack your neck most of the time, but if you do doing this in a certain motion it could be lethal.
5:03 "It's full of criminals!"
The sims 3 music in the background is just- 🥺
The narrator voice is annoying but like...I like it right? Just me ?Orr...
These criminals are like Stan and Mitch from Road 96, like no joke...
11:49 sad attempt at being italian
with the scarf I doubt the criminal would actually try to strangle you like what if they have a gun
🙃😢🤣🙃
I won't expose my feat to you for free  For free you you say so ther is a price
ARARARARARA
There are way to many funny moments in this video, but that rabbit stapler abomination is your child you created it it's your responsibility
5:09 Mans sounded like flamingo for a second
Imagine you getting kidnapped  * Pulls out  phone and turn on troom  Troom*. Bruh  call the police
is that sims music playing in the background 🤔
Whenever I see this video I get the urge to play Sims 3... I just realized it's in the background music at the beginning. Crazy
Background music? No… Sims build mode music
Troom troom really said “definitely doesnt offend”
“Kill your captors, kill them! It’s the only way to escape!” I was dying, you are hilarious!
Favorite part 4:39 Haho Hahoo
"Oh god get out of my throat" -Danny Gonzalez 2021
and spread your elbows apart on the way down
scotch's and duck tape are just brand names;. that could still be Scotch
4:49 This face should be a meme format
15:18
why is this so funny
🤣🤣🤣
I'm shocked at the outcome.
The whole zip tie use is because of flex-cuffs, which are essentially zip ties with a stronger, metal tie, used as disposable handcuffs that police use.
I nearly pissed myself laughing. I like this channel so far.
OK if you are in YOUR OWN car with a captor: JUST LOCK YOUR CAR to prevent it!
Woah! OK so if someone tries to strangle you from behind, just kill them. Break their neck. Perfect.
OK wait if someone tells you to stay in a room, but the room has loaded guns or guns and ammo, then just take the guns and force your way out through armed force. Its how the police get in, and how you can get out.
DID THAT CHICK HAVE TOE SOCKS????? WAIT DID SHE LIGHT A MATCH WITH HER FEET???????????
"I want to try out their life hacks. SO TODAY I'M GETTING KIDNAPPED" would have been a lot funnier Lol. If you are always as funny as you are in this video, I'm going to be a huge fan of this channel.
Watch out for criminals)
22:11
arrivedeci is pronoced (sorry didnt speel that right) a-ree-ve-de-ch-ee and it means goodbye in italian
Troom troom got recommended to me for the FIRST time ever after watching this video…. I think you have an issue here. I did more searching and a lot of ppl from their channel are coming from yours 🤔 seems a little sus to me
Why does the Narrator kinda sound like Dora...
is it bad that i thought he meant hacks for kidnapping people
26:18 man I’m really liking the new riddler
Nick predicted the riddler
I mean scotch tape
The duct tape escape thing also works for zip ties I'm pretty sure so it's pretty pog
9:07 uhhhhh did u see that manikin? its cut in hafe
troom troom's narrator couldn't have a more annoying voice
why is no one talking about the sims 3 music in the background
Tied up in duck tape? Perfect!
The way he kept pronouncing it “arriveDURchi” 😭
How do these people live with themselves? If my child was like I work for troom troom id disown them 🤣
you set my alexa off lol
why does nick look like benoftheweek
Laura after danny filming this video: DANNY I THOUGHT YOU DIED WHY ARE YOU WRISTS RED!?!?!
LMAO
There was this book series I read where this kid had seen the "flex your muscles while getting tied up" trick in a book so he tried it as the bad guys were actually tying him up and then the ropes loosened by like a fraction of an inch and he realized that the protagonists of the book were a lot more muscular than he was lmao
Someone should cut out the life hack parts and reupload it as “kidnapper gives you escape tips”
Boys: why do girls live longer than us? Also boys:
8:38 That's not Troom Troom, that's a trick magicians use to get out of straitjackets
I’m truly Greg
Thanks Danny. My partner demanded I duct tape his arms together and after getting out has gone full anime protagonist on me.
Give me your… g-g-g-g get in the car  -Danny Gonzalez 2022
This is the funniest video on YouTube convince me otherwise
Mom, can we have Batman? We have Batman at home. Batman at home: 13:26
This is the first vid I watched. *E V E R*
Is it just me, or when Danny was talking about his car seat, did anyone else imagine him buckled up in a tiny toddler car seat just smiling and waving?
The creepiest part of this video wasn't any of the kidnapping, or Troom Troom's awful narrator. It was the fact that there was just a random Alexa in that warehouse. That's some dystopian cyberpunk shit.
Matches that light when swiped against any surface is kind of a last century thing (or even the century before that). Most matches made today are safety matches, and are designed to only light up when swiped against the strip on the side of the matchbox.
When you said Alexa what is arevaderchey I don’t know how to spell that but anyways when you said that my Alexa went of also there always is an Alexa
“GIMME YOUR-.. SELF” lmao 💀💀
The 'tense all your muscles before being tied up' hack is also a common trick for learning how to escape a straitjacket!
Toe socks are in often t😆
The random rabble part at the bed part was funny.
just wanna take a moment to appreciate the wii sports guy impression from danny
"Getting Kidnapped?"  "Set yourself on fire!"
It Drweam
Danny is giving theatre kid, as he used to be one
1:32 It's supposed to be that guy talking to the other one. (my sisters are obsessed that's how I know)
We must trademark the toe match game
Everyones commenting about the actual video, im just wondering what the alexa said lol
13:54 Guess he forgot about that for the liver king lifestyle video
I had a cold and i laughed so hard snot went flying across the room
I love how the crafting corner wasn’t even in a corner
Bro stop your ruining the kidnap business how could you
never realized how much of the music from Sims 3 CAS  Danny uses in this video until now 😭😭 watching this like 'hmm...why do feel like building a pool and deleting the ladder?"
why is sims music playing in the background of this video
How did you get the zip ties off your wrists doe
Is that a real criminal?
I have taken karate and Tae Kwon Do classes for a little more than 6 years. If you're in a chokehold like the one at 9:18, you should NOT immediately try to snap your kidnapper's neck. It's dangerous and inefficient because you waste valuable time, effort, and energy trying to reach backwards in an awkward position. Instead, you should twist your head towards the crook of your attacker's arm to get some breathing room. You want to do this fast before they can clamp down their arm tight around your neck. Try to elbow them in the diaphragm, it's located right in the middle of their chest below their ribs. If you can't, it's fine, you just want to disable/hurt them enough that they loosen their grip. As you elbow them, stomp out with your opposite foot. This sets up your stance to throw them: with the other arm than the one you elbowed them with, grab their forearm. Then with the other arm, grab their tricep, or the bit of sleeve under their tricep. You want to move both your arms at the same time, in unison, as you throw your attacker. Make sure that you twist your hips in line with your throw. This will move your back leg (the one that hasn't stepped out) into a position that is more comfortable and gives power to the throw. While you throw them, you want to make sure that you're throwing them almost straight up and down, as opposed to over and around. This gives power to the throw and ensures that they're incapacitated while you run as fast as you can out of there.
They are, in fact, legally not allowed to chase you
Just googled where Troom Troom is filmed... Odessa, Ukraine along with 5 min crafts. Their content has always been weird, but wishing those who create these weird videos safety--oof.
Danny: they are legally not allowed to chase you   Me: they are legally not allowed to kidnap you
That last one with Duct Tape is a real hack. It also works with zip ties
arrivederci losers
Hey bjj guy here you gotta fight of the hands to prevent the rnc grabbing them like that ain’t gonna do crap
"Emily watches troom troom and knows life hacks": How to die
22:56 all the dinosaur fear the t-rex
Lol who else being strangled while watching? 😂😂 ghsbeibab!€}!jrniakqnfmdnwjbe help
“Congratulations, that’s a felony”
skyler has some stockholm syndrome
"theres always an alexa" that bit actually got me pretty good lmao
I’m wheezing at the gun criminal bit
I can’t with this video I’m dying laughing 😂😂
This is really funny lol. Also um who is behind the camera? It sounds like Kurtis lmao
Step 1: don't get kidnapped
Breathing in is a trick used by horses when they are being saddled. Good job coming up with that.
"There's always an Alexa!"
"I feel like I was choking you" "YOU WERE" I teared up from laughing so much 🤣
I can't with these troom troom videos. My god. These are made for toddlers, right?
As someone whose cousin got kidnapped, troom troom is disgusting for making light of it. It was the worst time of her life. I can't even watch this. I'm sorry.
10:12
9:20 LITERALLY HAD ME CHOKING ON MY LAUGHTER
Serious question, is Drew holding the camera? If not, is it a ghost or perhaps a criminal?
0:41 “gotcha girly 🤫🤐”
lets talk about how the narrator's voice is continuously cracking lmaoo
why in the thumbnail he is happy to be being burned alive thats disturbing
22:11your face Danny means it was the funniest part of the whole video 🤣🤣😂
Me: name is Greg also me: how does he know
7:18 And pause. Yep. That pretty much sums up the video.
If there's one thing I love it's kidnapping <3
these life hacks are very unacurit its very unlikely for your kidnapers to tie you up with zip ties
i appreciate Troom Troom for doing something we don't see enough of; siding with the kidnappers. too many channels take an anti-crime stance, it's nice to see one tat doesn't condemn crime. maybe because Ukraine isn't as steeped in capitalist propaganda as america, and more people understand the necessity of crime to the excluded classes (to borrow CrimethInc.'s terminology)...
Troom Troom is legit just the worst youtube channel ever tbh
Holy hell this is so hilarious if you played this at a comedy club everybody would die of laughing
Oh my gosh this room is filled with criminals look at all those criminals 5:09
23:27 lowkey set off my alexa
Oh no,there is going to be a Troom Troom movie!     *joke*
top notch voice acting
It looks more like a balaclava
like the tesla model 3 my man
As a victim of a kidnapping, these hacks are completely useless, unless your in that exact situation which most people aren't.
please believe in god,jesus died for your sins so that you can go to heaven,Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion,god and jesus can help you...
The tape technique also works on zipties
5:04 full of criminals
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait...what's a troom troom?? Lmao
3:09 I’m sorry does she have TOE SOCKS
Why is nobody talking about how ANNOYING that first narrators voice was
This is actually horrible imagine if a kid watches this and takes it seriously
steals sound from south park
21:42💀🤚
*Danny literally fighting for his life* Nick~ Danny, I feel like I am choking u... *a few romantic walks later* Nick~ I feel like I was choking u for a while there Danny~ YEAH YOU WERE
In lots of situations like the beginning in a cell, hands tied up in front, or on back how would she use toilet? With the second girl, always hands in front, she can do everything, what about hands cuffed on back ankles cuffed, gag and diaper to not untie her to go toilet or other things that happened?
she should have just taken the white sheets off the bed and pretended to be a ghost to scare the kidnappers away
Danny was just a Russian agent all along.  The Russian army has been watching his reviews of this Ukrainian channel to stoke rage among the ranks. Shame! SHAAAAME!
0:45 You can’t just put sims 3 “Create a sim” music in without a warning The whiplash I felt from the double take I made after hearing a song that has ingrained itself permanently into my brain over hours of creating sims is just…. Wow  It was a nice nostalgic feeling so I don’t mind
I've been doing martial arts my whole life and the most helpful tip I can give is (if you are caught in a life threatening situation) to put your hand in their mouth and drop down with your full weight. This will definitely break their jaw and it's so painful it stunns anyone.
I have never laughed soooooo hard
when did jordan peterson start narrating troomtroom videos
16:33, why does Danny look like Toby from the office?
**COUGH** oh my god get out of my throat -Danny 2021
4:25 here’s a fact for everyone, the opposite of Stockholm syndrome (where a victim falls in love with, for example, their captor(s)/kidnappers) is Lima syndrome, where the captor(s)/kidnapper falls in love with there victim.
The title of this sorta implies that he's testing tips to kidnap people instead of escaping kidnapping and I love that
why don't youtubers i'm sexually attracted to make videos about tying each other up/choking each other? when will supermega recreate this
please believe in god,jesus died for your sins so that you can go to heaven,Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion,god and jesus can help you..
Why does Danny look like Nate Jacobs at 13:16
9:23 [TF2 Soldier voice] NECK SNAP!
“I had to cut the tip off” that’s what she said 😏
0:22 lol
5:56 is the funniest part of this video the pained look on his face while saying something is really funny? gold.
Danny I love the video and its very funny, however, the crafting corner does not take place in a corner. That's a room. Youve taken us for fools
"GoTchA gIrlY" 😚❤️✌️😍😘
“-and it was kinda dangerous… AAAHHHHHHHHH”
The most unrealistic part of the Troom Troom video is that a girl would be walking to her car "not suspecting a thing"
Did he call me Greg? Or something? 👀
Who greg
The people Danny rented the garage from come back and the air soft gun is still on the wall
If you’re tied up, just don’t.
Yo hang on is that the sims 3 song in the background of this video???????
what did you mean you wont expose your feet "for free"
The sims 3 music in the beginning 👍
Nick looks like Ben if the week
“Gotcha girlie!” Why just why……..
As someone in karate yes that’s a real move there’s another variant where you don’t kill someone though lmao
Those actors must be making bank, who the fuck would want to act this??????
duct tape is designed to be able to rip apart for easier use, meaning it's a terrible choice for trying to kidnap somebody who's of full mental capacity.
Why he tryna diss em and he can't even reach 10 mil subs and\why so serious
but the kidnaper would have to own the scarf
"IM BEING KIDNAPPED!!!" The video pretty much showing what actually looks like a scene from a Paranormal Activity movie and not a kidnapping life hack video from Troom Troom.
im so sorry to whoever is the narrator but their constant high-pitched voice hurts my 3 remaining brain cells.
Pulls his neck sharply 😝🤗☺️
I'm sorry but I almost died laughing when he started talking abt cutting off the tip *cuz I'm gay like that) and then he said "DOIIII" 😂 💀 🤣 😅
When I was a kid I was productive and learning quadratic formula and algebra at 11 when others were watching troom troom
it’s okay Danny you already have a 4.96 Wikifeet rating
Was hoping I'd see your bare feet. Disappointed. 😔😢
Why is the narrator in the beginning not the real troom troom lady? I’m so confused
My god this is so fucking funny 🤣🤣🤣
no!
When danny is holding his breath he looks like ludwig
Please make a shirt that says "arrivederci losers" 😭😭😂😂
surely Troom Troom is some sort of surrealist comedic satire channel that has just baited the whole internet into thinking that they're for real
Why could they not push the barrel over and just take the chain off from the bottom
Chekhov would hate the second hack
omg u and nick should make more vids together u guys are so funny together
"now that is gonna stick together all pretty like. SCR-" is all i heard before i got an ad for league of legends. this is fine.
3:10 WHAT ARE HER SOCKS?!
brb buying duct tape cause I need to try this
Hi my name is Danny and welcome to jackass
14:23 my favorite part in this video
IDK WHY BUT EVEN THE THUMBNAIL IS FUNNY AF
Dammit dude… I was scrolling down and this stupid ass Troom Troom channel’s poll popped up while I was watching. Hate this algo sometimes. Glad you’re roasting this garbage.
CRUSH THEM
God and Jesus loves you all!
My notifications are on and I convinced my mom to become part of GREG. I am proud.
The narrator's voice is so WEIRD 😭😭😭
actual life saving tricks should have less specific circumstances to be actually useful
Danny, do you snore?
let me forget about this comment
I haven’t started watching, but my prediction is that Danny is gonna get kidnapped, a lot.
I feel the quality of troom troom has decreased… somehow. The narrator used to be tolerable, but the new narrator wants me to commit die.
“gotch girlie 😛”
These dudes not knowing you can strike a match on jeans 😂
Why does the fat troom troom girl have fruity pebbles glued to her cheek?! 😂 It's that the cool trend in Slovakia or wherever they're from?
18:03 im dying 😂
12:50 That's OK just turn the beanie around and wear it the other way and cut new holes, the original kidnappers did it too lol
It feels like the kidnapping video was made by someone who was isolated from other people and was raised watching 90s instructional videos.
Why are C-3PO and R2-D2 in the garage you rented?
Great job Martin! That’s a felony!
Imagine your sponsor doesn't make cases for your phone brand, guess I'm just special ಥ‿ಥ
Lmao had a good laugh
12:51 I think we found out why there was an extra hole in the back of that ski mask in the beginning. They must have messed up their first attempt too
*free*
I love how funny it is
Can we just acknowledge the slaughtered manikin in the dungeon
18:15 skinny privilege 🤮🤮🤮🤮
hypothetically, they still can strangle you without a scarf they would just put their hands around your neck and hold down on it.
Okay but fr though, the first troom troom video is a really dangerous message to their mainly child audience…
16:19 nick here is just a mood
Also another life hack for kidnappers!  “Cut the tip off”
It’s okay. I did the same thing Danny did with the glue a few weeks ago. I had some caulk that I needed to put in a corner, but I squeezed and squeezed and finally realized I had to cut off the plastic tip
the narrator's voice gives more suffering than the hacks 😭
“Best self defense move” *SNAP KIDNAPPERS NECK AND DIVORE THEIR BODY*
Is it jus t me or can we talk about the mannikin in the background and lest just be honest it is probably used for what it wasn't intended to do
Danny : Troom Troom are you kidnappers ? Troom Troom : OH SH..
Why is no one is talking about how annoying the narrator's voice is?
༼つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
The box trap failed because of 1 simple oversight...they never placed a big mac in it!
So troom troom think that wuen you snap a neck , the guy is not dead and if you being kidnaped the kidnaper will not tie your mouth , hand and foot
If they were trapped under that car seat they could just get in the driver seat run you over
1:06 they litterly made a tom and jerry trap that dont work on humans
Its like a child scripted troom troom
27:04 I actually laughed. Like out loud.
There is a certain angle the neck needs to be in to just paralyze but not kill so it could work to just snap the neck.
18:46 some dark corner of the internet is *really* happy this footage exists now.       Quentin Tarantino is there.
the narrators voice is the scariest thing
- 4:39 Pro-tip for anyone trying to hide their identity: don't bother wearing a mask if you're just going to leave your identifiable tattoos exposed. (*cough*VICE*cough* 😒) - 6:45 They could afford to buy a PS5 from scalper, but couldn't afford a used TV off of Craigslist. 🤨 Logic! - 6:55 Why does their cardboard TV have a gloryhole? 🤔 - 7:20 _Fifty Shades of Skylar._ - 19:10 _"What Danny didn't know, is he was using safety matches which only light when using the strip on the box."_ 🤦 - 21:03 This one is actually legit, puffing up your chest (or twisting your hand when being zipped-tied), can indeed give you enough wiggle room to get out, but it requires the kidnapper/cop not noticing, which is hard to do inconspicuously. - 24:40 Why do you have to unvelcro the scarf yourself? Wouldn't the attacker end up doing that themselves while pulling? - 27:55 Duct-tape is specifically designed to be tearable from lateral force, that's what you did. No surprise here. 🤷 - "Comedy" aside, these are dangerous because they are clearly targeted at children as the primary demographic, but kids don't understand these ridiculous "jokes", so they're going to take it seriously and these groom them for danger. 😒
imagine your kidnapper explaining to you how to escape him
29:39  me: oh i want to buy a case for my phone!  also me: wait i dont have a phone
"should I do a double, HEY you think I should do a double?" I literally laughed tears
nick looks a bit green.
i started watching nick is not green after seeing this bc it got recommended to me, but somehow… I didn’t realize this was the same guy even after i watched the video right after this one
ok but the nick guy kinda looks like benoftheweek...
There's really weird BDSM undertones to these Troom Troom videos and i feel like that this is another one of their videos that are supposed to be aimed towards an older audience but they completely forgot that only children watch their content so they're just making strange BDSM fetish videos and passing it off as hacks to help you get out of being kidnapped. Which if you think about it it's even weirder because not only does this video sort of imply that people are fucking clueless to not report people walking around balaclavas during spring/summer to 911 and that the cops are next to useless because even if the people aren't that clueless to not report them it sure as hell seems like the cops can't be bothered to look into the huge surge in 911 reports about a couple creepy people walking around in balaclavas in the middle of the summer. Oh and let's not also forget the implications this type of videos have if a parent catches their child or finds out that their child was/were watching this video; think the last thing we need in this day and age are more parents pissed off and upset that their child might be in active danger of being kidnapped.
The fucking sims music in the background😂😂😂😂😂
9:10  WHY DO THEY HAVE A SEX DOLL THERE
I find it so funny how amazed they are about the tape breaking so cleanly not realizing duct tape has perforations to help you tear it
I rewatch this video almost daily, easily Danny’s funniest video
Fun fact: Zip ties are actually pretty dangerous to use as restraints, and Danny probably shouldn't have tried that one, as its actually pretty easy for them to tighten suddenly and become really hard to remove, while also cutting off ones circulation
27:27 sounds like something you would hear at the gym lol
Imagine somebody watching troom troom stuff somebody in a truck whilst wearing ski masks
The driver that casually interrupted them on that first match is an icon. I relate to him terribly so. I would rather be trying life dumb hacks in public too than work a 9-5 job. 😭
Has no one noticed that the kidnapper was using the ps5 controller backwards?
BAD SIGN NOT GOOD
3:30 going on a ~bit~ of a rewatcing spree and I just noticed that for all the times the girl is holding the match (like when she strikes it) its a hand...its just a plain ass hand in some toe socks
Not him literally getting choked
Getting knapped is not a joke troom troom 😠😠
Troom troom needs some serious help with production values!
13:53 F- For free?
25:42 “yeah you were” LMAO
The girl in the beginning was probably some rich girl who was bored out of her mind and her getting kidnapped was the most entertainment she’s gotten in her life. BUT BRO DANNYS FACE NEAR THE END OF THAT ONE
Why am I just now realizing there’s Sims 4 music in this video?
thanks for the advice, ill be sure remember to leave, i mean what are they gonna do?
Yo noice
4:55 ah yes, sims yelling sound
I don’t think Danny knows how to breathe in properly
Troom Trooms videos are so bad that the channel is starting to become a garbage factory
4:41 troom troom always gave me ph vibes, this just confirms it even more
that "gOtchA gIRLy😚💫🧚‍♀️🌸" got me crying
danny.... did u not get strike anywhere matches?
THE SIMS MUSIC I CANT
0:22
Is no one going to talk about the abomination that was Her socks when she was grabbing those matches
I really hope we get some "Arrivederci, losers!" merch
10:04 the guy is not even back there in this clip lol, its just her with a blank expression pushing the seat backwards
This camera man's got the shakiest hands ever
3:07 HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS PERSONS SOCKS
24:46 - The ominous hand watches it all from the shadows
I'm immediately in love w nick
4:56 got me cry laughing 😭 😭 😭
i haven't been watching for a while, but i come back and why and how has troom troom narrator started sounding more annoying?
"you wizard how did you do that" Bro that shi was funny 🤣
As good as Detroit urban defence guy
Bush is fush
i bet u can speed run
Danny: They didn’t have toesocks  People editing Wikifeet: **finger hovering over the screenshot button**
Why is their dungeon nicer than my appartment though
how did you not now about the last one you absolute caveman non grass toucher
To be honest, people, who take advice from troom troom seriously, deserve to get kidnapped
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ummm Danny who’s your friend 👀
"Whats up greg! The title is incorrect, we will actually be doing asmr sitting and scrolling through instagram"
I was laughing 95 percent of this video
i almost threw up 4 separate times watching this video cuz i was laughing so hard i nearly died i could watch this forever
I'm so sorry, I'm 5 minutes in and I simply can't tolerate that vomit-inducing voiceover anymore. So sorry, Drew, no more watch time from me😔
hold on i know this is late but why did danny use Sims 3 music in his video
Danny completely ignored the TOE FINGERS
23:25 as an italian, i can confirm arrivederci means bye  also, troom troom have a really shitty pronounce bro
11:11 I Like your version of the sticker
I see R2-D2 in the background
8:07 (confused screaming)
danny got so weird when that guy asked them if they were shooting off fireworks
I'm pretty sure most modern matches can't be lit by just whatever, back in the day you could do that but for safety reasons most modern ones only light up if you strike those things on the side. As far as I know.
The funniest thing is that scotch tape doesn't have the same weaknesses as duct tape, so if he tried to do that same thing, it would not work at all 😂
"you got pretty nice skin... for a youtuber" 😂
We not gonna talk about that thing on the left at 1:30?
Me: mom can we get mortal kombat?  Mom: no sweetie, we have mortal kombat at home.  The mortal kombat at home: 6:50
It feels weird and uncomfortable to see Nicks legs.
How dose Danny not know about the duck tape escape trick it is all over the internet
he sounds like a smoker when he inhaled the black fuzzes
My car has the twisty things to decline your seat… so my captor will be crushed in 1-2 business days
"even as babies they were still guns" danny gonzalez 2021
the toe socks made me shutter
Arrivederci means “Until we meet again” or “Goodbye” in Italian.
I’m so happy y’all became friends
Wow Danny Beauty is showing 24:26
11:39 ah yes i was just being strangled by an indruder and decided to look up a youtube video to help me
danny should've given nick a tv or sumthin the disrespect 😌
is the sims 3 cas bg music playing or is it just me . 😂
Why is the narrators voice so annoying please 😭😭
Troom Troom is the new Bobble the Clown
That I’m being kidnapped that ain’t being kidnapped that’s a demonic possession
Why is he only addressing Greg? Who is Greg?
Nick is really funny in this video 👍
“Push the seat backwards to crush him” troom troom said calmly
Why does the  narrator sound like a my little pony character ??
can we appreciate how much work Danny put into this?
Thanks Dan, I used to wrap my victims with 3 layers, but now I'll make sure to use more!
HIS EXPRESSION WHILE ON FIRE! IDK WHY BUT IM WHEEZING
this was so funny
This video is pure gold
Omg the neck snap, my jaw dropped holy crap Troom Troom, we’re supposed to be getting out of a felony, not committing one ourselves??
WHO IS GREG I DONT WATCH DANNY THAT OFTEN
i have never in my life cried of laughter from a  video but there are tears in my eyes and my stomach hurts from laughter, cheeks sore from smiling LOL wtf is wrong with me this shit was funny af for no reason
Thank you Danny. Now I know that I should apply 4 layers of duct tape to the wrists of the people I kidnap!
Miss girl be like: ugh how rude I was literally about to go cronch some French toes
5:52 shoot the kidnappers with du gun.
Arrivederci losers 🤪
That duct tape breaking technique is actually taught in SERE school.
13:31 nö
The narrator’s been trying to tell us she’s been kidnapped for years.
great job kevin u just committed a felony
Troom Troom listened to the people who wanted a different voice-over guy, so they did just that.           But they somehow screwed that up, meaning that we now have a voice-over guy that sounds more annoying and condescending somehow! HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP?!
the fact that tge kidnapper is helping danny escape is so funny i cant
15:15 what do you mean by that
I like the boy in thumbnail that fire in his body but still smiling that nothing is wrong
Love u Danny G
5.8 10.12.15 layers of duct tape. Do it for the people
WHO TF SAYS " gatcha girlie" WHILE KIDNAPPING A PERSON JHHAJAHAHAHAJAHHAJA
ARE WE GOING TO IGNORE THE FUCKING SOCKS HERE!?!? 3:49
Did you know you cant breathe while smiling        Jk just wanted you to smile 😀
Bro the original videos have to be satire/shit posts. The hacks all bank on crazy luck, and tools that could actually help the captor in the background of the scenes are ignored. (Plus the obviously ridiculous scenarios.) The squeaky happy go lucky narrator is the icing on the cake. I think so many YouTubers accidentally make fun of/criticize videos that are actually SUPPOSED to be stupid (even if said videos don't do a great job of being funny about it).
Image having worked under Troom Troom on your resume. And they see something like this: whether you’re the producer or the actors it’s just bad 😂
"Yeah you were"
That woman's voice is incredibly annoying.
Thanks for the best laugh I've had in awhile! Watching you do great crafts part had my crying 🤣😂
8:08 Nice door 🙄
Are we just not gonna talk about those socks? Are we seriously just gonna pass over whatever that was?????
I feel like the match with the sock is a HUGE fire hazard too, like imagine if she dropped it and it landed on her foot, that’s a bad day for sure-
“Yeah you were” hahaha
14:10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Arrrrr
My friend said that you look transgender
9:09 is that a s3x doll in the back?!
Troom trooms part 2 to the video is life hacks on how to kidnap
I love how casually she says “are you getting strangled?”
Plot Twist: Troom Troom's whole channel is meant to entertain you by making you cringe and not an actual teaching video.
To ✨CRUSH HIM✨
The sims music in the background tho
Just a little too big of a mouth hole. Just a bit
(9:17) The "Neck snapping" (I don't know how to call it) is actually a technique that doesn't kill the person, but makes it lose its balance, the neck would have to be Perfectly straight for it to do something bad...
they did that thing with the duct tape in project MC2 too, project MC2 would never lie to us
When the jojo music kick in
I'm always gonna wear toe socks now, just in case
why did i think these were to help kidnap people
The Troom Troom video is cretinous. And why does the narrator drop her Ts like an English person?
Reverse Stockholm syndrome be like:
5:40 that’s discrimination
13:53   Hmmmmm for free, then what if I... ?
If you’re ever actually thrown into the trunk of a car there’s a safety switch you can pull (on cars made after 2001 I think) that glows in the dark
I saw this video and thought Troom Troom was giving us hacks on how to kidnap people      Needless to say I was quite disappointed.
It’s not pronounced arrivedurchi. It’s arrive-deh-chi.
I will never understand these people willing to be in videos like this. Trade your dignity for acting like a weird kidnapper for a children’s show or something? It’s embarrassing. If I knew the “actors” in real life I’d think they were losers.
I like the way they catch her in a cardboard box and stick trap like she's a raccoon or a squirrel
bro just fucking BITE THEM
IM FRFR LOSING IT AT THE ESCAPEING BEING TIED UP ON A CHAIR U DID the delivery was awesome
ok like 5 minutes in and I can't even stand the narrator's voice
no that's not how u we're a scarf unless ur a terrorist
Trooms trooms life hacks are good since they have no dislikes
"What every kidnapper has..." * Holds up gun *  "A gun?" "This is a criminal" "Okay?"
In all honesty I think videos like these that make a mockery of kidnapping are really disgusting. This is one of the worst things that can happen in your life, you could be murdered, raped, tortured etc and are constantly fearing for your life so to make a video where the kidnappers are just hanging out with their victim and act like characters from a cartoon just puts a bad taste in my mouth. Not to mention these weird ass videos are being shown to children for entertainment.
Danny having a crisis moment where he kinda really wants to try the hack but also kinda really doesn’t want to kill someone and go to prison and become someone’s b***h.
24:25 he’s the one in yellow at 4:22
I showed my dad this video and he didn’t believe it so tomorrow I’m getting tied up with duct tape to prove it to him
“Arrivederci” (the weird word the girl kept saying when she would escape) means “see you later” in Italian.
Danny don’t you know the criminal they were talking about was the plant holding the guns
“I cut it perfectly wrong”
I laughed so hard I got an asthma attack
Gotcha girly!
great ab workout!!
i love this video so much
I think troom troom was making a kidnapping video for kinky people.  How to make a realistic and sexy escape!  That’s the only reason the girl would give them a tv.
"Hey, dude, I just got back from being kidnapped." "Oh my god, are you ok?" "Yeah." "Ok, should I call the police?!" "No need." "You've already called them?" "Nah." "....what-" "Can you buy the kidnappers a TV?" "Tv?! Is that some sort of elaborate revenge?" "No."  "Then what is it?" "A gift. They needed a TV so I want to get them one." "THEY LITERALLY KIDNAPPED YOU, SUSIE." "Please?" "Ok..." "Yay!" "Why do I have friends like this?"
Nose
The ski mask part got me wheezing like crazy bro
Why is Danny prettier than me🧍🏻‍♀️
most annoying narrator voice ever
can we just talk about how cool the frog shirt is
Ugh I CANT stand her voice!!!
Dude the narrators voice sounds like goofy
8:39 my horse when I'm tightening the girth:
Groom groom is watching too much part 5 jojo with their “Arrivederci’s”.
Troom troom: we are running out of content... Let's make kidnapping life hacks
30:33  Wtf, i know it's kind of an ad, but the way that he let his phone fall is just-
my bf was sitting next to me while i was watching this and i was genuinely surprised about the tape thing too & he was like “duh?? that works??” and i had to physically attempt it myself bc i have noodle arms and zero upper body strength and it does in fact work and it was very fun to try
“are you getting strangled??” “…yeah :/“
Lady :be scared they have chains, Criminal: sniffs chains
9:32 too perfect
high as fuck watching this, need to pause the video every time nick puts on the fucking mask on because i start cry laughing. the way the mouth hole is so huge its literally an eye mask with a chin strap. the fucking glasses over the mask. it is so funny. very great bit
the cameraman is craig so he and the slowest growing army on youtube can learn how to make good videos
Why does Danny cough like a toddler
Bro is the kidnapper Mickey Mouse
so, when it comes to the duct tape thing, the tape can't handle the stress put on it when your wrists go to opposite sides with enough force, the pressure from both sides being pulled on and the swinging motion to break it weaken the tape and make it snap :)
well what if you get *KIDNAPPED!!* not <kidnapped>
I’m dying by the neck snap bit
That velcro scarf is shite.   Most likely, the attacker would have their own means to strangle you, with their hands or a piece of rope or cloth or something.   Leaning back, I'd theorize, is actually the best to do.
00:22 happy voice: I’m being kidnapped ! * happy music plays *
are you a part of milk gang
Dude when you made your kidnappers mask, I was dying laughing. Those little fuzzies were sneaky haha
10:12
They teaching us that if you got kidnapped you buy them a expensive item Lol
You aint gettin away from those kidnappers , the man just grabbed amd bagged a whale!
Why does the narrator sound like minnie trying not to break down
dollar tree kidnapper
Troom troom is actually a comedy channel and no one can convince me otherwise
the matches they use are designed to light on any surface, they arent regular matches
Danny you are the reason why I don't have depression
"Since when is a criminal good at art and craft."
The frog gave him power
15:06 circumcision doctors be like
The narrator makes me want to rip my ears off
This is bad because some stupid kid is gonna come across this video and actually believe it.
the first video was basically a girl with Stockholm syndrome
while this video is fantastic and the duct tape thing is a very cool party trick any experienced kidnapped woth probably use something much heavier duty. doing that will only turrakit ur wrists. also i think these are supposed to be shitty parodies of an extremely funny key and peele sketch? its called psycho clown its very good.
Bruh troom troom sucks
The hack with tape also works with zip ties
The voice of the narrator sounds like she’s dying inside and or has done that annoying voice too much and is losing her voice
as someone who takes self-defense lessons, i can tell you that that move actually doesn't kill someone, and it's actually a good move.
this was hilarious
Doesn’t he have a basement.....? Why did he rent out this garage? I’m so confused. 🤣🤣🤣
mom i want to go back home
I have an actual hack you can do. If you're being grabbed, urinate yourself or defecate yourself. It throws them off, they wouldn't expect it out of your. At least, that's what I've been told to do.
“ gotcha girrliee!!”
I cannot watch videos about Troom Troom anymore, holy fuck who the fuck thought that the narrator should sound like she’s on helium permanently, why the fuck did anyone think that was even a slightly ok idea
Damn g what a sweet fuckin video Your aunt says hi -love mom
Now nick is owed a tv and a ps5.
You know your crying but
Dude I was laughing so much my mom thought I was riding
9:43 i tried this. it does kill
Ok someone gotta kidnap the creators of troom troom and other similar ones ngl 😔
9:20 I'd recognise that song anywhere... La Segunda Nostalgia! Uses a drumloop sample used in many amazing songs.
idk if this is just me but i’ve known about the duct tape thing since i was little, i just thought everyone knew about that
You need to do a video on the movie "The swing of things" on hulu. Its sooooo amusing hahahaha
okay but its genuinely scary that troom troom is aimed at kids. a lot of the content they have has a horrible message.
When I was kidnapped, and had a gun against my head for a solid 2 and a half hours, I had the time to make custom socks, light a match, burn through the rope around my wrists, and excape the car. It actually worries me that some idiot might try these and get themselves killed.
4:44 did anyone else notice that the kidnappers left her in a room WITH 2 GUNS.
“She’s so pretty, so charming and graceful” “It’s obvious that he’s in love with her.” Girl getting her kidnapper to fall in love with her just by existing? Troom Troom must have been reading some wattpad fanfic before making this video because Skylar is radiating main character energy
6:23 or... THE WINDOW
Are you tied up with scotch tape? PERFECT! That's amazing! :D
Dude, when you asked Alexa what “arrivederci” means, the Alexa in my office literally said the exact same thing in tandem with the one that responded in the video. 😂
17:34 the gun at the back made me laugh my head off 😭✋
13:30 you could probably join Slipknot 🤷🏽‍♂️
4:38 im sorry but this just made me laugh
Look at all those criminal
Getting choked retrofit a cardboard box into a 3rd lung and begin breathing again
Is it just me or the first time he said CRUSH HIM with the editing made me laugh so hard
THE NARRATORS VOICE 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
8:36 WHY DOES HE SNIFF IT?! 💀💀 that actually got a good laugh out of me
I’m Greg
It's not a problem anymore
Lol 😂😂😂
I thought the video would be life hacks on how to kidnap
"how much force i would take to throwing it back but I guess it worth a shot" Danny
I have no words for just how much anger that Troom Troom channel makes me feel. Why are they making a kidnapping situation seem lighthearted and silly?! Like are you fucking kidding me? There’s actually children out there who experience terrifying shit like this and they try to make it fun and suggest the child should buy a TV for their captors lmao.
If kidnappers were smart enough to actually kidnap you and ask for a ransom, they'll use proper handcuff's lol, and not play with the key and accidentally drop it and it just so happens to land inside the cell.
Troom troom is a jojo reference
I love when kidnappers give me the pep talk I need to break the duct tape I mean Scotch tape.
Is literally no one going to talk about Danny saying "there's always an alexa"
Hi
“Ah his back!” 😂😂
4:55
Holy shit the narrator's voice is so annoying
Troom Troom is so informative. You just need to simply escape because your kidnappers will make it easy for you, and then you figure out that they just wanted a bit of ransom so you go ahead and buy them a new TV because clearly kidnappers are all in good spirit.
Real talk, Nick is low key cute
9:23 " alright grab his chin then place your other hand on the top of is head and snap his neck and now he'll no longer chase you "
Holy fuck your camera is so high quality
I can’t fucking stand Troom Troom’s voice.
CRUSH HIM
11:25 i remember in middle school a few classmates would like. tie a shit ton of duct tape around their wrists and try to break it off, would end up succeeding after a bit. this tip may not work for most people, but it *will* work for the weird people i went to middle school with
i dont thi nk the second video was kidnapping i think it was uh. look in the backgrounf 9:07
are we not gonna talk about the mannequin in the back 9:08
10:12
My little sister unironically watches TroomTroom and it makes me want to off myself
so glad troom troom respects the fear and torment the millions of wemon and men and anyone really could and do endore everyday being kidnapped, murdered, or raped. or all of it usually
When I've been kidnapped, I like to pretend I'm a spooky ghost.
heh women ahahah
I saw someone in Danny's merch at a Perkins and my mom asked "Who is Danny Gon.... Gorillas?"
The tape trick is accurate to real life military strategy  Thats where i got it from  A military officer
This fucking voice sounds like a really poor micky mouse impersonation
"catch it girly💅😍🤪" 1:30
I choose to believe that the hole in the ski mask in the first one was a mess up and they didn’t feel like getting a whole new mask
Impressive vid now abduct me so i can fact check
Skylar has Stockholm syndrome
I love how it’s called “life hack that MAY change your live” as in it might not save your life
A while ago some of friends were trying the end duct tape trick in class, but we were seeing how many zip ties we could brake, I got to like 4 zip ties and my friend ended up punching himself in the stomache
Jesus Christ I'm only a minute in and I am already going insane I can't stand troom troom's god damn voice
Then you did it
Danny you did a The scotch tape wrong
Bra
As someone who does Brazilian Jujitsu, I was impressed by the RNC from the criminal (wow! They actually got something right) only to be disappointed with stupidity of the solution they offer to the RNC. If you’re in an RNC, you’re already in a very bad place. The best thing is to avoid an RNC in the first place. If you failed at that, use your hands to fight their arms and try to get your back and head to the ground.
You gave me Zack Galifinakis energy with the slow no scarf walk
When nick says something thats like common sense and then danny explains how hes supposed to do it. Like in the car when nick just moved it reminds me of when u play a game with a younger cousin and they are like "yeah but actually im very powerful and i wanna be that superhero soo you cant do that"
Danny's inexperience with duct tape is amusing
Luv when ppl put sponsors at the end
11:49
i watch this video to sleep idk why it just puts me to sleep
Troom troom sounds more like a how you get yourself in to worse trouble
Okay that duct tape one actually shocked me 😆
God the narrator’s annoying
Bruh...
How dare troom troom use a JOJO reference in a horrible video like that
I take Italian and the only word I know is arrivederci so i would like to say that its good bye( informal)
D A R K A was here
Are you getting strangled?
Bro I swear the fist video looked like a cult video you be seeing from films.
"Arriverderci losers" ah yes I guess that's what bruno would have said
I asked google what does arrivaderchi mean and she said goodbye until we meet again so the girl just said she's probably gonna meet the kidnappers again
omggg i havent watched you in like 500 years
As an avid sims player, I couldn’t stop getting distracted from what Danny’s saying in the beginning of the video due to sims 3 tunes dominating my brain waves 😂
“what’s a square knot?” “it’s the kind of knot you would tie, you fucking square.”
3:33 but… you can’t strike a match on random hard surfaces? Only on the box? Do we like have different matches in Australia or smth?
Why is the word Greg in your back
Kidnapping lifehack: Develop Stockholm-syndrome :D
push the seat backward to *CRUSH HIM* 😂🤣😭💀
The bandit in the second part looks like. Walmart $1 french  Vlad lenin
3:09, wtf are those socks?
The reason that duct tape hack works is because duct tape is not designed to hold against that type of force.  Its the same reason you can tear off the length of duct tape you need without having to use scissors or a knife.
Danny do you play league of legends
Wait a minute there’s a bunch of guns in the room grab one of those fucking things off the wall and then shoot the kidnappers
11:48 ho lee sheet is that a bucciarati reference
dreammmmmmmmmmmmmmmm～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～
13:12 I died
But as soon as they bring their scarf, ur screwed
9:23 This went from a family friendly show to dark really quick
Actual good "*life hack*"  Put them in a hospital :D
Thumbnail 🧘😁🔥
This is a great video of what not to do when kidnapping.
2:57 we have a saying for that in Sweden which basically translates to luck in the bad luck
Its arvidelchi and it means goodbye in italian
Nice shirt
The "bandits" have a PS5 in the first part where they get the tv
The voice in the troom troom video is so f ing annoying.
are we not gonna talk about the naked mannequin? 9:09
How is danny so funny?? 4:57
at 8:30 there is a naked umm mannequin so thats a bad sign
These are for jiafei
i guess when ever you rent a garage in cali you get a free alexa in every one!
ariverdici
Danny more Luke dantdm
Danny you know the real way to get out of duct tape is to straighten your arms but instead of just bringing them down you bring them down on your knee. So. Sorta what you did.
um when was 3 or 4 i watched troom troom's
This troom troom advice gives me the sane vibes as my religion teacher telling us “just call 911” when I asked if we were allowed to physically harm someone to escape from them. For context she claimed that the bible said you were never allowed to physically harm someone
I can't believe the duct tape hack actually worked...
13:05  funniest thing I’ve seen all day
Troom Troom are you... Kidnapper's!?
If they start chocking you from behind DO NOT TRY THAT. Tuck your chin, pull down and step behind
This didn’t help me kidnap people so the kidnapping hacks ARE bad
"I felt i was chokeing you" o.o "yeah you were" O-O WHAT THE
arrivederci means "until we meet again," which is a little concerning in this situation.
when ur hands are tied like that with ductape or even zipties it also works if u hit it against ur knee
Trying to snap their neck while they have you in a choke hold. Will not work. They’re just gonna tighten their grip and you’re not gonna be able to breathe XD can someone give Troom Troom something. I don’t know what yet. But they need it
As An Experience Kidnapper  No, I Don't Just Chuck Matches Around The Fucking Room  This Is Why I Own An Uno Deck
*_-oh-_*
This is a really weird observation, has anyone noticed that some of the makeup the actors have on sometimes is very…peculiar? Like, the first girl is wearing a very normal outfit and for some reason you’ll see at 3:36 she has on like…Fairy Eczema or something??? I dunno it’s such a weird subtle detail but It really throws me off and I don’t know anything about fashion
you forgot the blanket one with the "criminals/gund"
I’m sorry I can’t watch this video. That kidnapping video is just to fucking awful I cannot stand it. Not even Danny’s incredible comedy can redeem this video. That kidnapping video is just to much cringe for me.
8:07 pro tip open the bad guys
4:47 This made me laugh so hard. The fact he's yelling in random sounds.
I always wonder how high is the possibilty of being kidnapped as a grown woman/man in the Western World? Like seriously? I would guess it is more likely to be Struck by lighting.  Kinda like people watching survival in the jungle videos like they EVER need this.
A random robber: *duct tapes my wrists*  Me, an intellectual: *raises my wrist to surrender*
I think videos that are meant to be funny, should take being funny, more serious than well... Whatever priorities they took in the first one. Like holy fuck
Imagine Troom Troom commenting telling these are fake
Detroit Threat Manag..what? TroomTroom got the tips.
She said until we meet again in Italian. When she said arrivederci She said Goodbye, losers in Italian.
dont worry guys if u have a good phone (samsung) then u dont need a rhino case
I like your friend’s 97’s
Get out of my throat - Danny gonzalez( that’s what she said)
Key word * FOR FREE
who's greg?
27:30 "Even if your arms break or your wrists break or you hurt yourself or you know- you're crying and you start bleeding-"
I love your videos
“ it’s the kind of knot you’d die you fucking square “😂
As someone who survived a kidnapping... this is exactly how it went (✿^‿^) !
9:08 TROOMTROOM WTF IS THAT IN THE BACKGROUND
When she’s in the dungeon and she’s doing the match thing she wasn’t tired on her feet so she could’ve just used her hands since they weren’t very tied
22:12
spit at 2:07
21:45 hehe the wink
If I ever get kidnapped I will tell them I will escape and give you a tv!!!
10:12  C R U S H
I like how Danny was so offended by them calling duct tape scotch tape
Yes snaping your neck will paralyze you causing u not to be able to breath ending with a cause of death
I think you meant "surprise adoption".
As someone who was in fact kidnapped in a car, that "Get out of the car hack" sure was helpful!
Danny when he was holding his breath was so funny, he looked like an aggressive chipmunk.
EYYYY
You forgot to get your kidnapper a TV and Xbox
so nobody is talking about the kidnappers socks!
never knew i needed this video in my life
Anyone else think of jojo when he said arrivederci
why is no one talking about the square knot jokes and nick just saying "jesus" to both times that was the absolute height of comedy for me. perfect setup, perfect execution, perfect reaction
As an Italian, their pronunciation of the  word "Arrivederci" makes be want to die.
I wonder if these weird videos are intended to help kids not get trafficked, which definitely does need to be talked about in real ways (not the qanon distracted crap), and kids need much more serious advice than this
AH YES i too get my neck snapped and fall over. but i am only stunned for around 4 seconds, after witch i get back up and go back to hard labor.
are we gonna talk about the jim halpert face at 23:13
Now troom troom is using Jo-Jo references
Why does the "ski-mask" make nick look like a sketchy sonic?
Doesn't the narrator ever get tired of talking with such a high pitched voice?
classic horror movie reference 0:23
A baby has more braincells than troom troom workers
Like how the video is about smacking common sence on troom troom, its pogchamp, and yes apperantly 1 huge box can keep a human stuck
i love danny's frog shirt. where 2 cop
You kind of look like lip Gallagher from shameless
Did anyone else notice the manikin on the ground during hack #2
The matches lifehack wouldn’t work even if you had matches. You need a matchbox
How did troom troom find the moist annoying voiceover artist to voiceover their videos
Narrator still sounds sick. She's sounded like this for like a year now.
the fall at the very end of the video lmao
Troop troop made a jojo reference. I now think it deserves to be cremated prematurely than dissolved in acid
Gun =criminal
GOTCHA GIRLY
Remember kids! If you get kidnapped pull out the secret gun you have on you and then smack them in the face with it.
0/10 not what I expected  This only applies if your the one being kidnapped and not the one kidnapping >:(
With how much he giggled while he was being kidnapped, I think the Troom Troom videos were pretty accurate. I wonder if Danny got them a TV, a Playstation, or something else. Also, I loved watching them have so much fun with applied physics.
B$
Scotch tape escape: Step 1: straighten yourself  Damn guys I already failed
"it's not a mistake",✨IT'S MASTER PIECE
7:21 funny you say that, sometimes people who are kidnapped or held hostage experience Stockholm syndrome which is a psychological condition where the kidnapped person or people catch feeling for the kidnapper and sympathize with them
Imagine going on a walk and seeing a guy in a burglar mask with glasses on standing next to a guy with a long scarf on looking at something on his computer planning out how he was gonna kidnap scarf boy
When you were asked alexa a question my alexa answered
he was really on one in this video lol
10:48 CREM
he is gonna DIE
The crafting corner is like the update corner except Danny doesn’t hate every second of it
If you’re in an unlocked, unguarded cell with hands poorly tied with zipties, you could probably just pull the door open and leave rather then melting your zipties with a match and toe socks
Can someone please tell me why minimouse is on the side of the kidnaper's side
isn't the duct tape one you strain then pull it to your chest? troom troom be a bit dumb with descriptions
Nick reminds me of Nick from the Cat in The Hat Knows A lot About That-
How do you not know what arrivederci means? Have you never watched Jojo's??
hello
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
" and im not going to show you my feet for free for you sickos "  What  In  The  Fuck
IS THAT A JOJO REFERANCE
H ho h ho
I swear the narrator is on drugs
6:35 so you mean to tell me they have a ps5 (or at least a controller for one) but they don’t have a tv???
Oh my fucking god. You make me lol so much... I'm literally crying
9:09 jojo reference 😳😳
3:10 what’s thins😂😂😂😂
“Bet you didn’t see that coming” Pietro:u stole ma catchphrase (ง'̀-'́)ง
Most modern matches are safety matches, which means they're designed to only be able to be lighted on the strips on the side of the box. The reason you see people lighting matches on walls in movies is because most matches used to be strike anywhere matches, which would ignite on friction with anything.
Anyone think he is Mr. Beast? 12:46
the pull it up sharp is real
is the narrator fucking mickey mouse - I would like to clarify I'm not implying the narrator fcked Mickey Mouse, merely that they sound very much like Mickey Mouse
the troom troom narrator is on "coke" if you know what i mean
The gun taped on the wall😭
The duck tape trick also works for zip ties
Arrivederci is goodbye in Italian for those of you who don't know that 😀
Me watching the funniest thing ever (silence)   Me watching a 20 year old man coffing with a uneven ski mask (cant breath because of laughter)
one thing.                                                  Stockholm syndrome.
Thank you for the thoughtful ambience, Danny ❤
Just came back to this vid... OMG IT'S NICK!!!
That troom troom narrating voice is so fucking annoying
I thought he was gonna really kidnap someone I got so scared like tf 😭
Holy crap the voiceover girl on that first kidnapping video is straight up nails on a chalkboard. She's significantly worse than the usual voiceover girl, assuming it's a new girl.
3:08 mans is wearing feet gloves
no, not in a room full of guns. a rooms full of crimanals
15:11 my jewish dad when i was born
Yeah no this is actually how they met up and got to know each other y'know?
I've been watching your videos for years and never have I seen such a weird troom troom vid
9:06 anyone else see the sex doll looking thing on the floor
The worst part about these vids is the comments. 👁👄👁                         "Amazing video! 😍"
Me who has a dial thingy to put my seat back that takes 20 years: *guess I’ll die*
And then *CRUSH HIM!* 🤣🤣🤣
Oh no not the criminals 🔫🔫🔫
very funny shit danny
the robber mask looks like griffith
strain yourself, danny.
I like your videos but your friend nick is a hypocrite and makes fun of other peoples beliefs and appearances on his channel all the time but hates it when others do.
You should've just used the Tile Mate alarm
9:24 Can confirm that will kill a person, I just tested it :)
Random, but Nick is freaking awesome.
No one: Kidnapper: *Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark*
4:47 bruh clash royale sound effect
arrivederci means goodbye
Who noticed how much "effort" Nick put in to being A kidnapper! ☺
When youthe duct tape one is actually real 🌝
What in the Stockholm syndrome
I like how that hack video was a love story
i tried this and it works above 10 layers
The fact that troom Troom stole the duct tape hack from tik tok and wengie and probably others but Danny believed troom Troom cam came up with it is funny. It legit feels like he's been living under a rock
Oh. The title really threw me off, I thought Danny was gonna kidnap people using troom trooms hacks
I am gonna burn the kidnapper 😂
is arrivederci a jojos reference????
me to my phone: you… you… you have to cut the tip off 😐
The only thing I thought of when he said I want you to zip tie me like a kidnapper all I thought of was I want you to zip tie me like one of your French girls lol 😂😂
14:18
Danny should make his own life hack videos
I really wanted to watch this video but five minutes in I cannot stand that lady’s voice
Now I know not to buy duct tape for when I kidnap Danny….
I like Nick.
The thumb nail- 😂😂😂😂😭 I can’t anymore-
5:20 Danny is describing juzo from No Guns life
Why do her socks have toes like gloves ? Wtf
4:25 reverse stockholm sydrom lmao
When I clicked on this I unironically thought it was hacks on how to kidnap someone
the thing about these poor interns is that they're still creative young adults lmao I feel like I could have the time of my life making a troom troom video honestly they're just making it as ridiculous as they can at this point they dgaf
Danny with the goofiest proud ass smile when he escaped the ropes
The ziptie thing wasn't working because the Troom Troom video used extra long match sticks. But, regardless, the odds of this exact scenario happening in real life is probably a billion in one. Extremely unrealistic and dangerous to attempt, like we saw when they tried to replicate it..
i thought that this would teach me how to kidnap people easier i cant kidnap people easier after watching
Does that brand have a deal with actual mf NASA
The narrators voice is triggering my fight or flight
‘To master kidnapping you must master ski masks fluff’
It’s bye in Italian 🤦‍♀️🤪
Girl: *Doing nothing bothersome* The Kidnapper: RUGHRUGHRUGHRUGH
I feel like the narrator is going to stab me. my fight or flight response activates every time she speaks
5:13
Pain
8:36 did... Did he sniff the chain?
(11:51) She said, smiling.
The troom troom narrator makes me wanna off myself jesus christ
Ah fuck. I was happier in general when I watched this.
I am losing and gaining brain cells when I watch these videos. Because I'll be watching these dumb people but I feel better once I realise that I am not completely brain dead, but at the point I'm not even gaining brain cells
11:21 I knew that one from project mc2 lmao
The square knot joke is 10/10
Honestly the duct tape one is so stupid. Most of them easily rip apart, in fact you usually dont even need scissors to tare apart a piece, they don't handle physical strains very well.
i love your in life troom troom kidnapping hacks.
Are those really duct tapes? I am having doubts.
I love the way he says little black fuzzys
9:20 if you are in a chokehold like this, do not do what they did, because any inteligent human will not let you do this, and it is a waste of time, as a chokehold will cut off blood circulation to your brain, and you WILL pass out in 5-10 seconds, and at that point you will either be dead, or kidnapped.
NOW i CRUSH HIS BONES  *slowly reclines
"yeah that's right, when you were tying me up I breathed out and flexed my muscles"
Nick has high waters on. Lol his pants
Who the FÜČI<  is wearing TOE SOCKS when then get kidnapped? Scratch that- who is EVER wearing toe socks😫 ? Edit: @ 3:08
“get tight” -nick 2021
Me gets kidnapped    Troomtroom: *step aside I know what to do*
It kills team
10:11 IM DYING LAUGHING😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i love how he plays that old flamingo intro music during this whole thing
arrivederci is italian lol
Sir if someone is strangling you they want to kill you! it crushes your windpipe
I’m sorry but the high pitched, energetic *”theres our victim!”* is by far the funniest shit-
Wait a minute... aren't plastic fumes poisonous? And you make them by melting plastic?
Troom troom. Doesn't know weapons exist
sooooooooo he said he wont do it for free.............hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I would bet that they don't use fabric glue because it takes to long to dry and their whole thing is being able to whip up useless shit quickly
9:15 he looks like he gets so close to hitting the wall
Cause you could TOTALLY not unlock it from the inside
i legitimately dont even care how stupid this is, i just hate the voiceover.
This seems like a bad case of Stockholm syndrome
8:08 wat
“Guns don’t kill people. People kill people. People like me. People with guns.” - ExplosmEntertainment’s American guy
13:36 that’s what she said
you are so funny!!
When he got strangled
Gotcha girlie<3
6:41 So they have a ps5 but not a tv? Pathetic.
omfg I'm so tired of hearing people say guns kill people. This is fake news. Bullets kill people.
This is like my third time watching and I only just noticed the sims 3 music in the back
This has the same vibes as Detroit Urban Survival Training
Troom Troom is a money laundering scheme, right? I refuse to believe a group of people made something so cringe and terrible and thought "yep that looks good, I'm proud of it, let's upload it."
“”Gotcha girly 😇””
the narrator sounds like minnie mouse but worse. why is she doing that fake higher pitched voice
"Troom troom are you kidnappers?!" How do you think they get anyone to work for them
It’s funny seeing how Danny has no idea on how duck tape works and is genuinely amazed it actually broke 💀
It’s full of criminals!
I feel like the one where he was tied to the chair wouldn’t work to well for a lot women
He didn't say he wouldn't show his feet on camera he just said not for free! Onlyfans coming soon?
Conspiracy theory: Troom Troom doesn't hire actors, they are sucked into a human trafficking ring and forced to act in the skits
Her voice..... it makes me wanna click away
27:20 what an inspirational speech
15:52
Ur not gonna expose your feet for {free} .....
ahoohoo
The tape does work with enough force and in a different way
OMG THAT WAS  SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO FUNNY!!!!!! can i please have a shout out??????????????
I love how the kidnappers were playing mortal Kombat on the tv
the "Velcro scarf" one should have been named "CRUSH HIM"
For the tape one u have to be sitting like the girl was.
In my car the front seats are on a rail like thing and I know from experience it can crush the person in the back seat to hospital.
big nose
yeah areivadirche means goodbye
The Voiceover in this Troom Troom makes me have It flashbacks
(troomtroom narrator) now we get rid of the evidence! Actor: wait, what? "NOW WE GET RID OF THE EVIDENCE, here you can use these matches! A: uuh (leaves) tr: sends these "professional kidnappers after them"
Irl, a neck break makes it really hard to move (neck is connected to spine) it's just whenever the neck does a 360 or 180 like in movies where you just die, so irl, no a neck snap won't kill you, unless they end up shattering your neck somehow and mess up the inside of your neck, making you suffocate or messing up your jugular vein, (idk what a jugular does tho, google it)
"he looks so good in that scarf
what the fuck is a troom troom
Why does your face have an upside down V
"i did it perfectly wrong, it seems" has me in tears omg
He forgot to circumcise the glue 😲
“Gotcha girly😁”
8:12 When you're escaping your kidnappers as quietly as possible but you're considerate enough to close the car door and alert them
I'm very late on this but why is there sims 3 music playing in the background??
I didn't read the "kidnapping" part, so it was a shocker
14:27 wait…. Kurtis?
The “I’m being kidnapped!” **gets dragged into a menacing dark room** immediately followed by the happy little music in the Troom Troom intro is genuinely one of the best clips ever
That part when when Nick was choking Danny made me die from laughter
WOOP WOOP a 31 minute danny gonzalez video!? zoinks!
Also when someone is grabbing your neck In the grab you are probably not strong enough to succeed,and you’re better off grabbing hair or ears.
nick: “i feel like its choking you!” also nick: is strangling the life out of danny with a tear away scarf
Hi! im here to tell you that Jesus Christ loves you and wants you to repent and trust in Him! He gave up His glory and His throne to suffer and die for us, because we’ve all sinned against a holy and perfectly just God, but He gave His only son Jesus for you. Because we’re all heading to hell, because we’ve sinned (lied, stolen, using God’s name as a cussword, dishonoring your parents, making up your own god, adultery etc. Like c’mon you can’t tell me you haven’t lied atleast once in your life). But John 3:16: for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, so that everyone that believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Yeah you heard that right! God wants to give you everlasting life with Him, but that’s not possible when you’re still living in sin and because of that you’ll spend eternity in hell. That’s why Jesus came! So now all you have to do is repent wholeheartedly of your sins and trust in Jesus! He will give you a new heart with new desires and you will be made new and holy. But we’ll never be perfect on this earth, because we’re still in our earthly body. But we’ll be deattached to our flesh and we’ll have our focus on Jesus and God’s kingdom that’s coming! It’s coming very soon btw so please repent (confess and forsake) of your sins and trust in Jesus that He may change you and make you new and give you everlasting life in Heaven without disease, lain, suffering etc. Instead of hell and hellfire. So repent and trust in Jesus!! He’s the one that can save you and He loves you so much!! <333 Please think about this :)
I laughed too hard at Nick with mask 😂😂 I literally had to pause the video to chill.. "So I guess if you're tied up, just stand up"- I'm done 🤣
i swear i have never laughed that hard at a video before😂
oml i thought he meant tik toks to help kidnap someone
On the first hack the girl could just stand up bend over and pick up the match why your foot also for the foot swipe its clearly a hand TV is this shech
Why is there Sims 3 music in the beginning of the video?
Lol
Arrivederci JOJO REFRENCE
I love when Danny wears that frog shirt. I hope he never gets rid of it
Yea but ur still tied up.....oh
5:53 two months but god if I didn't think for a solid minute that "brothers" was a translation error, and the two were a married couple with children 😶
8:18 Hey! Have you been kidnapped? Just unkidnap yourself, It's that easy!
As much as this is funny tht video should be deleted because kids are watching it and might think tht how you do it
I'm about to be murdered or fucked... man this place sux
L  O  N  G       L  E  G  S
I cannot believe the tape thing worked.
Hes Staying humble with apicture of himself on a wall
The whole video sounds like a Wattpad story written by a 12 year old
*IM GONNA KILL SANTA CLAAUUUUS*
I'm Italian  Arrivederci=see you later (until we meet again)
There was a sex doll in the scene where she is tied up with the chains
Even for the “hacks” that work, they require the kidnapper to do specific things it is unrealistic to count on. Troom Troom is clearly going for comedy but those videos irk me deeply.
7:47 I'm just imagining a cop walking by seeing this wondering rather is this is a video or a real kidnapping that they're recordings to get money or some shit by a family member so they can get the girl back
Putting your chair back when being strangled if the seat uses a lever you can not only lower your neck to not get choked you can also use it to trap them in the car and run for help. Its a real technique
“Danny I feel like i-it’s choking you…” woah that sound weird out of context 🤣
this video makes me happy. i literally shouldn’t be smiling this much i got my wisdom teeth removed yesterday it hurts to smile
Kidnapping hack: If you're being kidnapped, just say no! They can't legally kidnap you without your permission.
first, there was centaur kurtis now, centaur danny  the trinity is almost complete
bruh... she's talking from each characters perspective and the "good job Martin." is from the other kidnappers POV.
I know the duct tape one basically the sheer force of you rapidly moving your arms down and then swiftly pulling your elbows back makes it snap.
How about instead of trying to catch the person you’re trying to abduct steal the car and just hit them with it
Danny always makes me fucking luagh so hard
what in the fuck
I wanna die when i saw her socks they were like gloves for feet
Lol nicks shock that there is an Alexa was priceless lol
Nick is such a kind kidnapper he even gives his prisoners advice on how to escape he do kind.
9:18 Why is the captor in the background just watching he scene
8:35  Why did he smell the chain and why is the way the chain I'd tied seem kinky
Thanks Danny now I know not to duct tape the kids wrists
These troom troom voiceovers make me want to go full van Gogh
Btw there are matches that will work they just bought the wrong ones (seen by the matches having a red tip instead of green)
Bro right after the kidnappers were "gifted" a free tv I got an add for a free tv
gosh the narrators voice is so annoying
I love that Danny casually discovers tabi socks in this video and doesn’t even realize
Great job Martin, you did it! *that's a felony*
The first video is next level Stockholm syndrome
By the way, this Kevin guy really reminds me of CallMeKevin for some reason. They look the same and they both have a dungeon where they keep prisoners.
13:06 I’m crying
also 3:35 this girls toes be like we fingas now
1:29 the gotcha girly xdxdxxdxdxdxd
when the cameraman cant help but laugh
I can’t believe that the last trick worked
27:07most epic buildup
24:26 this cracked me up way too much
0:35 lol if anything people wanna kidnap celebrities
The dirty memes goodbye and telling me again
So matches are made with red phosphorus now instead of white phosphorus. Because of this, matches no longer strike on everything only on the safety strip on the side. White phosphorus is extremely hazardous so the use of it has been discontinued completely.
The narrators voice makes me want to shove knives in my ears.
That’s a felony 😀
Arrivederci means bye in japanese
whats the sponsor music
i screenshotted you as billie eilish and its till my laptop screensaver

27:10 the giggle sounds like kurtis 😱😱😱😱
Bro i saw the part with the tv and then got and ad that said: Did someone you don't know buy something for you?
they look like teenagers
The narrator makes me want to be kidnapped and killed.
its greg heffley
3:36 I’m sorry, is that her foot
The breathe in trick doesn’t really work with people. But animals (like horses) will try it sometimes. When you go to tighten the straps on them they will breathe in so that it’s loose when you ride. I mean, this isn’t that common but the intelligent ones will do it
The girl I kidnapped tried this, she failed miserably.
You didn’t even get Nick a tv, fake video
She sounds like Mickey mouse
and we all were like naw danny its a joke dont be scared when nick says he knows where you live! little did we know....
The crafting bit made me lol so bad haha
i was prepared to dance at the end of the video....
Troom Troom is one of the best reasons to keep dislikes on YouTube.
You could have edited out the whole glue nozzle debacle and the fact that you didn't is one reason i like you.
Were those strike anywhere matches? I would imagine that this matches would work since it’s possible to just light them by striking jeans
So you must wear toe socks and a velcro scarf at all times.
Somehow the voice and the tips got stupider
If you ever get out in a choke hold, tuck your chin to your chest as soon as you see them reaching. This will allow you to still breathe bc they won’t be able to put their arm around your neck. If you can, try to move your chin to their elbow while remaining tucked. (Rotate your head to line it up). Then you can lift up with your arms and push their arms over your head. They likely won’t be expecting it and people don’t have a lot of downforce with their arms, so it should be manageable.   This is a serious post. I took a self defense class in college taught by a local officer.
Did any of y’all see her socks bro….
This was the video that introduced me to nick's channel, so thank you danny
I’m genuinely shocked that the duct tape hack actually worked
Danny's teeth are so damn white
I watched this 2 years ago then stopped watching then found it again
14:10
9:08 why is threre a naked manikin back there
Hack #2 Just do what horses do when you're putting the saddle on!  🤭 my friend's horse would do that she always had to double check the sadle
Mfw theres a almost naked life sized woman doll in the corner at 9:10
From the American outdoors guide website:  "To break duct tape, you must raise your arms over your head as high as you can. Then in one quick move, bring your arms down, while forcing your elbows to go past your ribcage. It may not tear completely at the first try, so keep doing it until you succeed"
25:33 two graceful centaurs
Is nobody gonna talk about the dummy at 9:08 and the bed with chains…?
You know, the best way to prevent getting choked by someone in the backseat of your car is to check the backseat before you start driving. I always put my bag or coat in the backseat of my car so I have to check anyway. My old car had a trunk that was connected to the backseat so I'd usually open the trunk or use a flashlight from the backseat.
yummy black fuzz mm
Here's a real tactic if you ever kidnapped kick out one of the lights
before this video, i honestly wasn't aware that escaping from duct tape wasn't common knowledge, it might just be where i live, or the fact that i'm a girl, but i thought that it was just taught regularly as self defense
why is there a naked mannequin in the background at 9:08
8:36 why the fuck is he smelling the chain
danny seemed extremely disgusted in this video 😂
just to let y'all know, it would take 100-110% lbs times their body weight at LEAST to snap someone's neck. so no, I would not recommend that as a self defense move.
I'm screwed. I have button operated seats.
jesus christ the narrator’s voice is unbearable
Why didn't she just tell them she needed to tell her best friend she was in love with her? I hear kidnappers will just let you go if you tell them that.
Life hack number 1: Break his neck
dude thats james potter
“what does arrivederci mean”  jojo fans:
My eyes hurt from laughing so hard 😂
Lol 😂
at the beginning I think the narrator is actually the kidnappers talking to eachother
I like the Sims soundtrack
ITS THE SIMS 3 MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND FOR ME
Wtf is troom troom?
“Gimme-uh g- ge- get in the car!” LMAO
Y is the dungeon hot pink
Okay, but the last hack is an actual trick you should use if you actually get kidnapped.
Nick: "I feel like I'm choking you!" Also Nick: *currently choking Danny*
Its not about escaping your kidnappers, its about the friends we made along the way.
i like how their is literally no dislike
ok, in that second video with "emily" is it just me or is there a fucking naked female doll lying on the floor, like DO THESE CRIMINALS TAKE TURNS RAPING A DOLL?
stop making me lol so much lol!!! also i'm drunk but beside that i really like the episodes where you talk about troom troom oh and bad AD episodes are good too
So we aren’t going to talk about the voice over lady having voice cracks like every sentence. Who is she trying to sound like? Mickey Mouse?
I should tell yoonbum about this shit
"i feel like 3 layers is pretty normal"-danny 2021
Is this written by kidnappers?   Looool 😆 👍
Wtf was the box for if the kidnapper just grabbed her anyway and why was that girl so interested in taking a selfie, with a box
the quick "bye-"
9:08 Is-  Is nobody else concerned about the mannequin in the back..?  I certainly am.
8:07 : the door isn’t even locked. Me: but you’re locked… INSIDE… the car.
I love when he wears that scarf 🤣
about the trunk part ... yes you can get out of a car easily if it is not moving and you are not tied and you are in the trunk.  But not the way she did. There is actually in most cars a way to open the car from inside of the trunk (it was made mandatory to install this in cars in 2002 so all cars that are made after that have a trunk release but allot of companies have started puting those in since the 70s) in modern cars it is more obvious it is a quite big red leather you have to pull or press. in older cars it tends to be in the center of the door underneath the covering of that door. it sounds harder to get to than it actually is. once you located it just wait until the car stops and run in zig zags in case they have guns.  Also in modern cars it tends to be on the side of the trunk so check your head and feet if it is not directly to the side it is on the side of the trunk door. again either left or right
Haha funny
I myself while watching this oml
Notifications on.
So in self-defense danny, we are taught to give up any possessions , it absolutely is give the person what they want, it's not worth risking your life
You should start every video with whether or not the title is correct, it would resolve a lot of the stress I have for the first few minutes as I try to sort that out for myself
"that's a really funny joke, i like that" he says with a straight face
i'm sorry , but you are playing sims 3 music and i am completely derailed by that
the mask he made had me dyingggg bruh
cass eris does in-depth breakdowns of jordan peterson's books on her channel and the narrator in this video sounds like the voice she uses for peterson
Now you've thrown him off his rhythm!
6:56 Are they making a Glory Hole?!? 8:36 What were they using that chain for? Dude SNIFFS it. 13:54 So what you're saying is you'll take payments?  BTW, it takes a certain type of match to light it on walls...
i can’t explain it but this is a comfort video now
This made me laugh so much🤣
0:41 *someone is getting kidnapped*         Troom Troom: Catch it girlie!
Ur friend was funny lol
YouTube age restricted one of my videos because it was about sex education... Meanwhile this is what Troom Troom promotes... And not to mention their videos when they teach kids to make weapons with nails or when then they teach them to bully... 😑
Snapping their neck turns them into the joker obbbvviiii Danny
10:06 to 10:13 made me laugh hard
it takes like 400 pounds of force to brake a dudes neck
This is literally too much work I’ll just stay kidnapped.
21:48
10:12
17:00
YOU WERE TO FUNNY YOU MADE ME CHOKE
great job _martin_ you did it... *thats a felony*
LMAO that ski mask part reminded me of Django Unchained when the racist dudes have an argument about their shitty KKK hoods.
the 4 serial killers subscribed to Danny watching this video: interesting
"that's really in my throat!"  he really said that.  Danny, I'm here for you, booboo.
myth busters be shaking in their boots
did anyone else think the picture of him using an inhaler in the background was him drinking a glass of water
it would have been cool if he showed some actual tips or maybe resources but i totally understand that that’s not really his responsibility
15:07 my mind I blown
The logic behind the tape one is that duct table rips easily horizontally so by doing that the tape would break.
The breathing hack might actually work if done correctly, your goal is basically to make yourself as big as you can. Same for when they tie your wrists, instead of holding the inner sides of your wrists together, you only touch with the top inner sides (in order to hide that you're separating the rest of the wrist). Also if the kidnapper is dumb enough, you can put your wrists side by side (only sides touching).  Another actual tip, if you are zip tied you can break them by doing the same thing you did to break the duct tape, the only other step is to tighten the zip ties first, as this creates more tension. You can also loop something (seatbelt, belt, shoelace, ect) through the zip tie and step on it to create the force needed (which is helpful for people who aren't strong enough to snap zip ties as is).
9:19 as a wrestler, what she did with putting her hands back on home will actually make it tighter, ik this from first hand experience
the kidnappers Forced the narrator to side with them.
the troom troom voice over sounds like minnie mouses child
The voice acting sounds like Shenmue
11:52 yea😔
Ah yea, let's teach kids that being kidnapped is a fun and adventurous trip where you can try out your new tricks, and not a life threatening situation where doing anything suspicious can get you shot.
Who said holy s***
U kinda sound like kusoko from emperors new groove
9:03 kinky
The socks on the girl in the dungeon scene is totally photo shopped 100 percent lol
In an actual situation you want to do everything they say don’t try to escape take notes on them and what their doing kind of be buddy buddy with them and build a relationship so they don’t kill you
9:10 why is there a sex doll on the floor?
My mum actually has a work scarf made with Velcro in case of a customer trying to choke her with it 😂😂
Alright today we gonna be shootin some 22 caliber criminals
One of the best collabs I've seen
The neck snapping thing would 100% not work. They just pulled that straight out of mortal Kombat. Might as well pull out your attacker's spine and turn them into a baby while you're at it.
Danny do kinda have cute feet though
lol
Anyone else spotting the sims 3 music in the background 0.o
"kidnapping hacks" .... I thought it's a hack for idiot kidnappers so they can kidnap more people.
Why do the people in troom troom use there own voices instead of making weird rat noises 😂
Sims 3 create a sim music is so distracting once I noticed it
Guess as a baby they were still guns .Danny Gonzalez 2021.
16:30 the absolute difference between Danny’s tone and face is killing me here 😂
I already knew the chain thing works, I've done it with my seatbelt.
why is her voice so high in the first video what the fuck happened
9:15 If Bucciarati went like this, I think my depression would be cured
27:06   NO  lmaoo
15:15 he circumcised the glue
Damn talk about having Stockholm syndrome
PSA: do not try the last one with packing tape instead of duct tape. It HURTS
29:04 LOL  Nick: so we started- Danny: breaks duck tap Me: XD😂😂😂😂😂
Arrivaderci means "Till we meet again" in italian
Ok, *i t b e g i n s*  Day 1 of asking Danny Gonzalez to review Joshua and The Promised Land
Conspiracy theory time!  Troom Troom's ultimate plan in all this with the kidnapping videos is actually to make kidnapping seem all nice and fun (as we just saw) so THEY can take advantage of it and kidnap people for their nefarious deeds like black market organ selling and stuff like that. It's all a ploy bc black market business would be way more profitable than YT. And there you have it.  *mic drop 🎤
5:35 wise words
9:07 we can confirm, that troom troom girl is Bruno Bucciarati
Did you see the Mannequin
You and nick remind me of the bird and the little guy from the regular show
This is especially awful since sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking and human trafficking is a major problem for women in Ukraine where TroomTroom is made lol
are you tied up with scotch tape?         ...        PERFECT!!!
Also as someone who knows how to do martial arts 9:24 insults me
Danny taking the obvious joke hacks as deadly serious is peak comedy
Arrivederci, Loser!
Puff your chest might work better then flexing
Why would you tie someone up with scotch tape
Pls react to lankybox
The part where she ignores the guns and gets the duvet instead is such scary movie logic
I think I’ve watched more reactions to troom troom than actual troom troom videos
22:37 another great life hack. Just tie the kidnapper up instead.
This voice is making me aggressive
i was constipated in the beginning of this video.  now i’m not.
The troom troom voice makes me cringe 😬
When I saw the title I just thought “Tips and tricks to kidnap people”
Danny’s videos never fail to make me laugh
9:09 We aint going to talk about the naked dummy on the floor?
8:08 thats a really cool paint job
this really helped me kidnap kids thanks!
Hey Danny! the technique with duct tape around your wrists and the movement downwards is actually a government/military technique if you're restrained by anything that isn't metal. it works with lighter ropes, tape, zip ties etc!
Omg he hit 5 million
“Great job Martian you did it..! That’s a felony.”
"its obvious that he's in love with her" I didn't know troom troom was wattpad
3:08 I just realized.. who wears toe socks
"the videos are bad" GotCHA gIrlIE!!!!!
THE SCARF ONE WAS SO FUNNY TO ME LMFAOOOOOOOOO IM SCREAMING
gOT Ya gIrLY! 🐭
The narrator’s voice in troom troom videos has been progressively getting more and more annoying as time goes on, and I am extremely worried
You posted this the day after I was abducted, such incredible timing. Holy hell. Finally getting round to watching it now since it was too soon then HAHA
This is honestly one of his best videos. My favourite 100% ❤️
14:31 wait- can anyone tell me why Dannys head looks so freaking big like- his proportions are so off 👁️👄👁️
4:40  4:59 5:25 i can't-
9:09 jojo refrence?
🤣🤣🤣 that's the best way to be though I'm still trying to figure out that statement.
I know about your little secret
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶😱🤔🙏🏻ha
I have heard some people say that horses will breathe in when being saddled up. So, when the person gets on the saddle, the horse breathes out and they fall off.
This is the first video I ever saw from this YouTuber and I ship the 2 guys.
"im getting bullied"  Google:Talk to a teacher  Bing: 10:11
Nah if I was her I'd send them a TV, not because any other reason but to hope they don't kidnap anyone else and use them as ransom for a new TV.
Stockholm syndrome got me like:
I am officially a Greg now
Who’s holding the camera
the narrator has a special place in my nightmares
hey look, our boy got a haircut
i thought he was gonna kidnap someone XD
i Laughed sooooooo hard in the carfting part of the video
are tied up with scotch tape ? perfect !
10:03 I find it funny that her face just leaves her body
Guns = criminals
31 minutes of pure enjoyment
I have only started watching Danny today, so I don't know who Greg is and his significance in Danny's life
18:51 “let’s pretend like it didn’t fall out of my…toes”
So mostly kids watch these videos and they’re saying “there’s lots of fun games to play with matches” 💀
“GOTCHA GIRLY!?!??!” 😂
Danny: I did it perfeclty wrong  Says me on every assignment.. ever
13:26 Who invited off brand 'The Collector'
7:21 Stockholm syndrome
Next time I’m kidnapped I’ll make sure to look up Troom Troom’s channel to see what to do.
Oh no it’s criminals 🔫
9:10 WAS THAT A BLOODY JOJO REFERENCE?!!?!?!?!?
Aaa
yes danny, snapping someones neck kills them because the brain that controls your blood flow and stuff is connected to your spinal cord and that connects to your nervous system which connects to everything else
arrivederci - until we meet again 😂😂
why is this the funniest video from you 😹😹😼
Currently imagining Laura eavesdropping on him doing the crafts and then hearing "come on out... Daddyo. COME ON OUT a vast COME OUT. I Probably gotta cut the tip off right? WOW!" and just jumping to conclusions
did not expect nick to be as tall as danny. very shocked. need a troom troom video for recovery.
9:16 NO if someone is grabbing you like that you should use your elbows to punch their stomach
gotcha girlie!!!
Stockholm's syndrome at it's finest. I love to see it.
arrivederci is goodbye in italian :) (i live in italy)
10:51  What if the robber/kidnapper brings his own scarf
I don't know man, but to me it seems like his videos are funnier now and he makes better jokes, keep up the good work drew!      I mean danny
I just love how he puts SO MUCH effort in his videos....
do you not get that these are satire ?
"Step one of this life hack is wearing toe socks at all times."  *Looks at feet* Check
3:38 why would the kidnapper leave the door unlocked :|
So they got a ps5 but no TV???
I though I'd learn how to kidnap someone
that thumbnail is great
She really said a Japanese word first and now she says a Italian word
as a professional kidnapper i can say that they work
"If you're tied up, just stand up and leave." How profound! Lol
The narrator's voice somehow got worse.
Troom troom’s IQ drops by ♾ every time they say anything
GREAT JOB MARTIN!
i love the sims background music
"are you tied up with scotch tape?" "nah, it's duct tape."  lmao
Hey this didnt teach me to kidnap kids!
Yes it will kill them
I'm the Dwarf!
is nobody gonna talk about the naked doll during the chain breathing in “hack”
omg i could not stop laughing throughout this whole video!! loved it!!😂💕
cpafting copnep
3:08 *so we’re just not gonna talk about how those socks had distinguished toes?*
Usually kidnappers even in movies duct tape after putting your hands behind your back, so...
The look at 15:35 😂😂😂 I’m dyinggg. I’ve rewound it like 5 times.
Seems like a morgz video...
"are you tied up with Scotch tape?" WITH A CASUAL TONE LIKE IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY
"if your kidnapped, get out of the car" What if I was unconscious
5 million incoming 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't cope with the narrator. Princess Peach and Barbie had a deranged daughter and I can't deal with it 😭
19:12 I can’t stop rewatching lmaoo, idk why. It’s the excitement of Danny thinking nick got it so he just has his hands out and ready.
GoTcHa gIrLiE
i’m watching this while laying on my couch sideways, which means i’m not wearing my glasses and it’s really blurry and kinda just colored blobs and when he was cutting the ski mask and like said like “oh maybe it’s more authentic” i was half asleep and got jump scared so hard when the music like changed. LMAO MY HEART IS BEATING SO FAST
“the car will break down and the door will be unlocked. Get out of the car and they will not legally be allowed to chase you” I mean that IS true i suppose
NICK PUTTING ON THE SKI MASK IS SENDING ME
"i always wear this" LMAOO
i'm sorry but the kidnapper brothers' baby picture is the funniest thing I've seen in 2021
“Oh he had like a meet- like a… quinceañera or something” “I guess yeah he has a quinceañera” 💀💀
Just commenting to see how many times I've commented on Danny's Videos
this is my new comfort video
drew’s videos are always a great way to end the day❤️
To CRUSH him😂
no cuz dannys so attractive
Spoiler alert: a kidnapper watches this and knows to use rope not "scotch tape"
10:47IM GONNA PEE MYSELF WHY IS THIS PART SO FUNNY  AND THIS PART OML 24:28  AND THIS BAHHSSKSJAJ 25:33
seeing that the kidnapped person gifts the kidnappers a tv or a playstation is very unlikely though there is a phenomenon known as the stockholm syndrome(from Wikipedia: Stockholm syndrome is a condition in which hostages develop a psychological bond with their captors during captivity.). It is very unlikely. The most popular example and the derivative of its name was in Stockholm on the 23rd to 28th of august 1973. A man tried to rob one of the largest banks in sweden with his friend; and failed. So they took 4 employees as hostages and kept them for 6 days in one of the bank's vault. When the hostages were released, none of them would testify against neither of their captors tl;dr: gifting your captor something expensive is very unlikely. But begging for mercy or not testifying against them has a very low chance but might happen
So basically Stockholm syndrome but in the form of a skit.
Shearing duct tape is an actual ttp taught in the premier military POW survival schools. That is the only useful bit of information from the referenced video. Somehow they got one right. Remember, never eject over enemy territory without Bobby pins y’all.
My last name is Gonzalez 😳
Imagine telling your kidnapper “the life hack said you are suppose to stay there”
At 8:08 it glitches
You look vaguely familiar I feel like I’ve seen an Andrei animation about you
another thing is that when she melts the wire around her hands, she just opens the cage. she didnt need to melt her wire if the door is unlocked
Hahahahah get out of my throat 🤣
The duct tape bit was amazing, who knew?! Crazy! 😮
I FREAKING LOVE your kidnapper! 🤣💜
The "you likey"
wouldn’t this help kidnappers too, yeah good job troom troom
Notice how the title says “MAY save your life”. Troom Troom knows that the hacks they include will most likely not work.
Well congratulations troom troom that was the dumbest life hack video I’ve ever seen
"How much force I would have to put into throwing it back to crush someone?" - Danny, 2021.
I love how a popular, stupidly childish YouTube channel is making light of assault and kidnapping, and Youtube is just letting it slide. Fucking evil.
The people who made that video must be making A LOT of money in exchange for their dignity.
Use these to impeove your kidnapping
hi Dude I am Kevin I know Hu are you
3:08 I don’t think that’s how socks work..
Ari veder chi means see ya or something like that
Breaking a neck won't kill anyone
Omw it's the gun devil
10:00 In that moment id do this:                                      Moan daddy
hey danny! convicted kidnapper here, while kidnapping is exciting, we do get bored once in a while and play with matches in front of our victims! it's really fun
Chipotle cup ftw
If I'm ever kidnapped, I'm going to be mightily disappointed if it doesn't turn out the way Troom Troom said it would.
i sub and put on notifications i am truly Greg
you gotta snip the tip silly goose
10:18 out of context is funny
With her in the kidnappers room, did anyone else's mind go "oh god, they're gonna r*pe her."
Troom Troom: Are you being strangled? Danny: lol yeah
his face in almost all his thumbnails are 👁👄👁
love the live circumcision of the hot glue! beautiful ceremony
Conspiricy thoery: Greg is Greg Davis from Taskmaster and Danny does these videos as part of a long and elaborate task to conquer the internet.
that works with duct tape for sure, it's tearable. but scotch tape mm glad y'all didn't try
TROOM troom is fricing stupid it doesnt make any sense  and i am kid that hates cringe and friking stupid kid shows.
Great way to set your house on fire
Okay, if someone was choking you, putting your hands back and snapping their neck while choking and in a horrible position would ABSOLUTELY WORK
19:00 danny and nick in their caveman era
The voice sounds like an alien trying to act human
Lĺlĺĺĺĺl
I’m savory but are we not going to talk about these girls creepy toe socks? She looks like she is wearing so,e sort of feet gloves and it’s kinda disturbing😐
In my self defense class years ago my instructor taught us the duct tape one and he went all out. Layers and layers and we could break it.
I love that  spitfire banner
12:25 donda
Danny:what criminal has ever been good at arts and crafts Hitler:*cries*
Anyone else see the mannequin in the background of the Troom Troom video?-
nick is the perfect person for this video
Maybe best video I’ve seen in a while 3:35 we gonna talk about how that’s her hand?
Pulling up to the shoot lookin like a hooved creature be like
10:10 LOL
wait why's he so fine
Love how the crafting segment is just Danny failing to grasp the stretching physics of fabric.
9:09 whats that Mannequin for?
I am Greg. The mossy rock snek
*gotcha girly*
10:00 Ut oh KINKY
We aren’t going to talk about that doll on the ground in 9:10
think the actual worst part of this video is the fact its targeting kids
Okay- Wait, I’m not the only one who noticed that when “Skylar” strikes the wall the very next frame is her hold the lit match with her hands...right?
The new troom troom voice makes me wanna become a criminal
Sims 3 create a sim music is god tier
This guy makes me laugh so hard.
Ok as someone who has gone through this sort of training before, 1.) the muscle flexing one is entirely circumstantial, you most times would not be conscious or in the right mental capacity to remember when you’re being tied up. Most people also don’t have that drastic of difference in size when they flex or relax their muscles. 2.) Just lock your damn car doors oml.
i'm sorry i'm LOSING it over the Sims background music 🖐🏾😭
Omg Danny makes watching troom troom hilarious
nick is the best his better than danny
"areevahderchi"
Me in my car…w powered seats…..crushing my attacker🦹🏽‍♀️
13:24 you look like femto
For a second I thought the picture was of Kevin and Martin married with kids.
I HONESTLY USED TO WATCH TROOM TROOM AND NOW THAT I SEE IT AGAIN I HATE HOW THEY CHANGED THE VOICE OF THE NARRATOR.
Ok fine whats your onlyfans
Why did that bandit sniff the chain 😭
Hey Danny! Serious question! What chair are you using and is it good? Husband's in the market for a new chair haha
24:24
THE SIMS 3 MUSIC AT THE START GOES HARD LETS GOOOOO
Amazing
The “scotch tape” one will actually work with zip ties too.
The tape trick is actually well known in self defense and escape tactics lol its probably why they had it in there and certainly why it worked. It's not something they came up with or it would've been something like the toe socks and matches hack
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NARRATOR VOICE
14:27 i with he edited himself on top of kurtis green screened as a centaur
12:53 Berserk reference?
you are an amazing youtuber i love your videos
The tensing up one works. My classmate taught a group of that and I actually tried it... I'm surprised it's on a troomtroom video lol
why is troom troom sponsored by playstation 😭
where is the " I wanna Kill Santa Claus" ski mAsk
I don’t understand what’s going on because the dude isn’t wearing the mask
Are you tied up with ducktape? PERFECT! ( 11:11)
This is off topic but, WHAT IS WITH THAT GIRL'S SOCKS 3:07
its not bad ITS HORIBLE
why is the narrator on helium and why does their voice crack so much lmao
aaa yes my favourite kidnapping hack  burning my self alive
"Are you okay?" Meanwhile danny going super saiyan:
He said why would any one watch this yet I've watched it three times. its the toesocks for me.
I’m crying you are so funny! It is only 2:46 in and tears are running down my face. I haven’t cried since February 30th 1998, the year I was born. Well done sir. You are a true gem! Remember, big foot is real and he is packing.
did anyone else know about the duct tape hack from schitts creek LMAO
I think it’s sad that men don’t know that duct tape breaks like that. I feel like almost all girls know that…. Meaning we have to think about these things but men don’t. We live in fear of men. That sucks.
Why is nobody talking about the naked female mannequin lying around in the kidnapper's lair at 9:08? What the hell is Troom Troom trying to imply...that the mannequin is a real body and they killed and sexually assaulted a woman? I thought this was a kids channel.
CRUSH HIM
The narrator's voice is probably the best defense against getting kidnapped... this awfully fake happy tone.
okay now i crush his bone *goes down really slowly*
why... why there's so much video rubbish coming outta my goddamn country, I can't even...
Tag yourself, I'm the hair poking out of Nick's ski mask eyeholes @ 20:20
Uhhh....wtf am I watching?? And wtf is troom troom??
Ngl but I thought the title meant “How to kidnap”
Sheeesh i like your frogg shirt bro 😏
Toe socks are like gimp suits for your feet.  That gets me way hotter.
don't know why "arrivederci losers!" is the funniest thing ive ever heard
i legit thought i left the sims 3 playing in the background
1:33
Troom troom got Stockholm syndrome
Kidnappers watching this be like: Now I know what not to do
Hack #2 works
22:16  Look at Danny,"🎵 You were tying me up".. swollen with pride , revealing how he's outwitted  Nick - who ISN'T Impressed!? The zoom in to Dannys crestfallen confusion  and shock -🤣🤣🤣ahahahahaha!!! Such a great actor.
THE TOE SOCKS AHAHA
5:36 you had me in the first half i'm ngl
For the toe socks "hack" the foot becomes a hand in the wall striking scene. They werent even suttle about the switch too
Are you getting strangled yeaaaah 😂
the voice though
@13:55 Danny says he won’t expose his toes for free. You know what to do boys. Get those wallets out
arriverderci means "bye" somewhat casually in italian
"I'm not gonna walk around with shoes on without socks," RIP to Danny, but I'm different. I'd get out of a kidnapping solely because I haven't worn socks in 3 years.
T.T.T. Trying troom trooms awful hacks
I honestly don’t remember the last time i laughed so much
fun fact, you can light a match on your teeth if they are try. have a nice day
Moral of the story is that square knots suck. Taught-line hitch gang for life.
If this was done by anyone else it would seem pretty racist. But they made it seem absolutely not.
I thought it was hacks on how to kidnap somebody
How the hell did the troom troom voice get worse? Lmao it’s absolutely awful
i wanted the music on the end of the video 😢
I was going to do a morning meditation, but I’m watching this instead.
"Im Being Kidnapped!" "Better Watch A 10 Minute Video Of How To Avoid Getting Kidnapped!"
Im pretty sure i could annoy my way out dead or alive
ARE YOU GETTING STRANGLED? ..yeaaahhh…:-/
the narrator is making me wanna kms
where's the JoJo comments???
“Give me your-.. g-g-get in the car!” “Oh god, get out of my throat..” “Do they know what kidnapping is?!” “They are legally not allowed to chase you.” “Push the seat backwards to *crush them*
unus annus fans already know the duct tape- i mean scotch tape life hack
Oop
why is troom troom even making these videos are they trying to inform that their viewers are going to get kidnapped!?
danny: if your are being kidnapped by a car, the car will break down and when the car breaks down the doors will be unlocked and when they are unlocked just get out and leave. they are not leagally allowed to chase you.  me: I don't think they are leagally allowed to kidnap you either but here we are
at 7:16 his face about made me bust out laughing
at this point, danny is the only one making troom troom relevant.
What also might work if the kidnappers let you (BTW idk if this would work ive never tried this im just saying) Is put your forearms straight up cross your forearms side by side straighten them so they can get duct taped and then make a X with your arms really quickly then continue twisting your arms down as fast as you can and it might snap it. Also if your tied up with rope keep a small distance between your hands but make sure its not noticeable then slip your hands out.
5:09 is funny
22:20 you should have to the criminal
The "Arrivederci losers" is just amazing lol- and yes, it's basically like saying "bye"
This is some kinky shit right here😂
Comment of extra appreciation
9:11 I have the same white chair as the background’s
Those matches should work on any surface, but it's not a single flick, you gotta slowly move it horizontally and then flick it
Danny looks like batman
Who knew J J Bittenbinder works for Troom Troom?
11:56 I think they just wanted to call the PlayStation a business expense
i’m look like that guy from u
"how much force i would put into throwing it back to crush someone" 10:17   ... me waiting for the joke where he twerks on someone and they die
I love how the sims build mode music is on in the background
*OH NO IM BEING KIDNAPPED HELP ME OH MY GOD IM GONNA DI-*  *Happy-go-lucky upbeat troom troom intro*
the breath in and tense your muscles was in the hardy boys
Ok I just found this dude and I was wondering why he looked so familiar then it came to me… he was the person who did dream’s April fools face reveal prank
The true friends were the kidnappers we made along the way
8:07 proceed to turn both the guns into a car door, that'll teach them
Eww why was she eating a banana 🍌😐
Ok but did jira bully clickup or something? because they’re definitely coming for revenge jeez
lol
Your arms up you go opposite directions with your elbows
I love the toe match game, used to play it all the time when I was younger
"So whats going on over here?" "Do you mind if i ask you what you're doing over here?"
Guns don't kill people, criminals kill people  *and criminals are guns*
arriverdeci = a very formal goodbye in italian
I could laugh at that scream you had when the bandit started chocking you with the scarf all day 😂 But seriously though, now we crush his bones 😠
I like that they just had Criminal taped to the wall the entire time
13:35 you look like Griffith from berserk
Life hacks from Troom troom, how to open glue for dummies.
Conspiracy theory: Danny has been waiting for this kidnap life hack video to know how to prevent Greg from escaping after he kidnaps him
“And now I crush his bones”
The tape thing works for zip ties too. You put the point where it joins between your hands and then do the same motion.
Danny is Greg's evil twin
There are literal tears in my eyes right now-
I had to pause the video because I was laughing so hard
arrivederci, losers! 😘
"I'm being kidnapped!"
Did they change the voice of the narrator because somehow I hate this one more than the original one
You should try food hacks
I love how when Danny tries to break the duck tape. The music in the background gets louder, like it's an emotional and Inspirational moment.
Long have i waited
Is... is that kidnapper based on CallMeKevin? Facial hair, Kevin, basement dungeon, fire.....
did you get a haircut?
BAHHA I THOUGHT GREG WAS BENOFTHEWEEK
The fact throom throom have a dungeon is way more worrying
Why don't they just wrap your hands up like a ball, not like your ever going to be using them in captivity
Apparently only bad people play PlayStation?
How to get out of being Tide up: BREATH
danny i watched you when i was 12
"God he looks good, I love when he wears that scarf," HUAHHSHSUXHHABH THAT WAS ADORABLE AND HILARIOUS
OMG thats a Costa Rica shirt! Did Danny come to CR lately and i didnt know?????? :ccccccccc
Just a helpful note, you can do the "duct tape" trick on zip ties. It doesn't work well on actual duct tape if they roll then around a lot
I’m so high this is so fucking funny
Gimmie your get in the car
I would get nick a ps4 if here kidnapped me
Danny: wouldn’t snapping someone’s neck kill them? The person that was kidnapped: I was fucking KIDNAPPED
What a helpful kidnapper
Also why was the dungeon door left unlocked
.... My name is not greg
i like just fir forgit for got that he doens dose doesent were haed headphons lol phones
i interpreted the title in a much more different way
the fact that danny refers to influencers as non-civillian makes war crimes against them completely legal. this is THE MAN to vote for
Cracking someones neck can auctally kill them
Don t know about you but I m crushing a little over the kinaper
God I love their energy. Please do more collabs in the future
Arrivederci is goodbye in italian lmao
Why do you call your fans Greg?
9:08 is that a s*x doll?
21:21 I laughed so hard I ACTUALLY threw up
its the type of knot you would tie you fucking square
Me rewatching this yet again
7:18  I enjoy the fact Danny and I had the exact same expression on this moment
This video was so funny jesus thank you
b o i
4:35 I’m CRY LAUGHING at the DANCES. AND THEN DANNY DOING IT. WITH THE HUH HOOH HUH HOOH DUB OVER. PLEASE-
Is it just me or the troom troom narrator sounds like being choked by a man with a gun next to her head? I THINK SHE'S BEING KIDNAPPED GUYS! SEND HELP😰😨😨😰😥😰😨😰😥
this man is too funny
I don't like when people wear sunglasses in public bc I can't tell if we're making eye contact
It’s literally 3am and I had to Hold my laughter so I didn’t wake up people but I couldn’t contain my laughter keep up the funny bangers 😂
How did Danny accidentally do an escape artist move correctly. Like, figured it out on his own, separated from the video. Just, how.
’Great Job Martin! That’s a felony!’
This is complete bs. As a kidnapper myself, none of my victims ever stay calm. I always have to beat them till they quiet
I was high the first time I watched this and 8:08 literally confused me so fucking much. And Danny didn't really mention wtf happened he just said she got out of the car and I thought I was going insane.
17:35 Nick is just like STFU NOW.
12:26 Kanye west donda reference
This entire video was fruity🍒🍓🍇🍎🍉🍑🍊🍋🍍
the ducttape wrist thing also works with zipties
Mt Name Is Not GREG! Its Martin... Oh wait, I didn't kidnap anyone. Maybe.... Also, go back to Corridor, even though your videos keep me entertained.... Nvm, do Hwat you Hwant!
21:50 there are tears in my eyes. Danny didn't have to go that hard
Troom trooms narration progressively gets worse every video
Help. Lemme go
8:41
Bruh, your thumbnail is perfect. I can't stop laughing! 😂🤣
3:09 is anyone gonna talk about her socks 🤢🤮
I thought of this: if you have tape tied around you, keep on licking your lips until the tape on your mouth falls off. DON'T talk, because they will catch you screaming and shouting without being muffled; instead, use your teeth to take the tape of off your hands. Last part: legs, now just take the tape off of them. Now, walk slowly, but if you are seen, run for it. There something useful! :D
I wonder if you could do the same duck tape trick with your ankles
That narrator voice is like nails on a chalkboard.
I appreciate all the effort you put into this video. Don’t know why there are so many dislikes. Good job.
That duct tape one is acc pretty cool tho  *sorry scotch tape
9:14
I enjoyed this video immensely. Thank you for posting it Danny
at this point, troom troom is just a kids channel disguised as a life hack channel 😟
Sorry I’m a little late but yes snapping a neck will kill the person
"now i crush his bones" with the very slow electronic reclining was probably the funniest thing I've seen all week
push the seat back to CRUSH HIMMM hahahaha WHAT!?
I'm a 35 year old woman and wtf I'm laughing so hard. Maybe because my demographic is most likely to be kidnapped and we've all thought about these circumstances. Seeing the typical "kidnapper" going through this is morbidly hilarious
5:49 Shoot -The- 👎 Shoot _DA_ Kidnappers With Gunz 👍
8:06 nobody gonna talk about this?
I'm troomitized
Legit watching this and it’s 9:11PM right now Wow-
her voice is so unbearable holy fuck
i thought this was hacks to kidnap people, disappointing
i love thoughs hacks like im going to use it if i get kidnapped
Are you getting strangled?
arivadertiche LOOOOSERS
Why are her socks like that😭
i love how the voice over is the narrator, an established character, and an invisible character
My grandpa had a dickhead horse who would do hack 2 whenever he was being saddled. Miss you, Buddy
Just for context arrivederci means till we meet again so I'm not really sure why she even said that I would hope she wouldn't want to meet her kidnappers again but hey I don't know what to do when being kidnapped
Yes yes it can kill ppl u can do it just dont do it too sharp
My dad kept looking at me while I was watching this cause I kept laughing  Genuinely my favourite Danny video 👍
“If you have a budget kidnapper… I guess”
I want someone to look at me the way Danny looks at Nick when he's explaining something simple.
You should react too Degrassi it looks like a new show on Netflix
Before the video an ad for a kidnapping game just played soo... idk maybe the hacks are for that.
Me knowing the duct tape one was legit the whole time: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
yeah straiting yourself because you have to none gay for that to work
ohh sh__ thats not a self defense hack its a fu__ing murder trick
you should listen to the happy scream in slow motion and the women scream in slow motion to
"Hey! You guys playing the toe match game over here?" "NO get lost, these are ours! "  Bruh more Nick pls this vid was hilarious
Danny wanna know a life hack, instead of buying a black ski mask just wear some black panties
16:00 i have never seen a more uwu person in my life
Yea he's got a quinceanera 😅🤣
I'm literally crying and snorting I'm laughing so hard... this is gold.
Use casefy and your r phone won't break and you can also costomize it instead of picking 5 or 20 whatever options
Dweam
8:36 Did he just SNIFF that fricking chain???
the breathing in and the scotch tape escape are both real tips that troom troom just got slightly wrong! I'd have LOVED to see some input from someone who knows about self defense in this video, even though it was pretty clearly just for fun. they figured out the tape trick, but for the breathing in one, the trick is to make your chest and stomach as big as possible, then breathe out entirely and slowly wiggle free/loose
Im gay for u
Dobba florbatolez
Are you drea??
I dont know why but I assumed you meant life hacks to make kidnapping people easier? which would be way better tbh
ah shit troom troom here we go again
Something tells me that the match might light if struck on a more smooth surface than cinder block, like the floor or something.
im not sure if you guys know this but there are different types of matches: one which basically only lights on the match-strip and strike anywhere matches. I dropped chemistry but im pretty sure it has to do with the phosphorus in it. Idk which yall got tho just making sure.
yo Danny dis shit really funny good vid
They have a zombie apocalypse survibal hacks video. "So I made a zombie apocalypse so we can test these hacks :D"
Not me thinking they were gonna say how to kidnap someone and not how to get away-
STOP THE SIMS 3 MUSIC AT 0:50 HAHAHA
What is that voice???????
the mouth hole of the mask being big enough to pull down around nick's chin is killing me
oh, so the hacks are about how to escape...
11:25 "straighten urself" sorry I can't I'm to gay for that
Now I know to take off peoples toe socks when kidnapping them Noted.
She might have Stockholm syndrome considering that she sent them a tv
His seat slowly moving back sent me into a coughing laughing fit. 10/10 best video ever
This was sooo funny 🤣😂🤣
What was the name of the song during the sponsor section
i remember being taught the duct tape trick in 8th grade, it works with zipties too and its actually helpful lol
13:07 danny becoming ur 5/yo cousin having a coughing fit
Why does the voice sound like money mouse or some shit?
danny,,, why didnt u use the precut beanie,,, from "i wanna kill santa clause",,,,
danny is this… sims music…?
This Money somg sounds like you made it lol
You look like spider man
I am now GREG! Nothing else matters except GREG!
"Arrivederci" means goodbye in Italian
The troom troom narrator seems a little biased 🤔
9:37 My answer for the Question "Snapping someone's Neck Doesn't kill people? " Well, The procedure causes a classic "hangman's fracture" - a break between the head and the neck, effectively snapping the upper cervical spine. In most cases, the victim dies of asphyxiation.
Got it, for tweens.
The video is pretty good but i couldnt make to the end, the narator's voice is way too anoying
I'm surprised you haven't done "next" yet
Does anyone know where he got his shirt
Any movie where someone gets strangled like that has been completely ruined for me, if only they'd been wearing their troom troom scarves...
There's a kid in my class named greg
you look like the executioner from clash royale
Wow a video promoting Stockholm syndrom! Great job troom troom!
this is one of the best videos you've ever made
Couldn’t you call the cops instead if you got the chance to watch a video
I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard. Thank you!
We stand the sims music at the beggining
Where can I buy his feet pics? /hj
I'm so mad that I recognize this garage from a fucking smosh video
911: 911 what'd your emergancy   Me: I've been kidnapped and I'm stuck in the boot of car  911: well have you tried getting out of the cat  Me: God dam, I didn't think of thank one
What if they duct taped your wrists and elbows together? O.o
This video is so funny I rewatched it four times 😭😭😭
Why is she wearing a scarf with a skirt and t shirt
Btw are Vaderci ( i can remember how to spell it) means bye and it’s Italian also she pronounced it so wrong lol
You know... You could tell me Danny is 27 or 18 and I'd believe both...
3:08 gave me nightmares
The break free from tape-hack doesn’t work with any other type of tape …
sussy
They're legally not allowed to chase you - my favorite line of the year
Legitimately the funniest video on this channel. Or is it just 2am ……
I was coming home and in someone's window there was a stop sign that said Greg 😅
You have to check out troom troom rich sister vs poor sister.
We’re all dead when Danny reacts to gacha life
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while thank you lmao
Kidnappings usually happen for  Ransom Revenge Specialized Theft Secret Murder And Assassination
3:16 CURSED SOCKS
we all thought the same thing when she got put on the bed
"What does erruuu verdetsjiee mean? erruh verdurtchii?" arrivederci, but you were close Danny xD
Love the Sims music.
IT'S ABOUT DRIVE 😤 ITS ABOUT POWER 🔥 WE STAY HUNGRY😈 WE DEVOUR 👹 PUT IN THE WORK 💪 PUT IN THE HOURS ⌚ AND TAKE WHATS OURS🥶
John 3 16 For God so loved the world, He sent his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him, may have eternal life
4:48 did...did they just use a Jerma sound effect???
lol could not stop laughing the hole time
thought that was a guess sweatshirt…
Wouldn’t the scarf also break when they try to strangle u
3:37 wait…wut is she holding the match with…?
These hacks can't work, because the people doing Troom Troom's voiceover are obviously being held hostage in a basement dungeon
Duct tape is perforated
Have not watched Danny in a long time and I'm so happy I watched this video  "Whats a square knot" "Its a knot you tie you fucken square"
i can't believe that troom troom is still... existing
22:30 is me legiterally at any point in my life.
Missed opportunity to play "help, let me go" honestly
She's wearing the toe socks on her hand 👁👄👁
He didn't say "Hey Greg."
I love Nick coaching Danny through breaking the duct tape and it actually working 😭😭
the socks
I love that he didn’t even use the Velcro he just ripped it off
Lol.  The neck lift was so poorly done.  The reason you lift and twist someone's head like that is to disorient them.  It's used in many different moves.  Some people will even add it to an arm bar.  I assume they think may loosen the captor's grip.  Which is why she was supposedly able to spin him off of her.  However, the execution shown her was very unlikely to work.  So the best she would get is a loosened grip.  If the grip does loosen, and if your fast enough, you can take hold between their thumb and pointer finger and fully drop your weight.  They wouldn't be able to keep you in a choke hold.  But, that's assuming they actually loosen their grip from the first step.
Why does Drew’s head look so big compared to his body when he’s crafting
I feel like since Danny calls us Greg should we call home something??
I really want to staple that narrators mouth shut. Her voice just kills my last remaining brain cells.
I made the mistake of watching this while eating lunch and I almost choked from laughter!
danny.... horses dont have two toes on each foot.....
"Are you tied up with Scotch tape?" *"Perfect!"*
21:40
9:09 what is in the freaking background
this was so funny hahahahahahahah
Skylar on that Stockholm Syndrome shit.
Top life hack for getting kidnapped     Don’t get kidnapped
The narrator's voice is getting on my nerves and I'm only like 2 minutes-
ÇŔŪ§H HĪM.*COUGH* *COUGH*
I learned the duct tape trick form tik tok and also a cutting the zip tie with your shoelace trick
sims 3 cas music why.
i'm losing it
What I’m seeing is that I should use four layers of “scotch” tape when kidnapping people.
It's the A-vea- durchi for me.🤣🤣👋🏾
7:21 ye i guess sheesh
3:00 She's not tied TO the chair is she? You don't even need to melt the god damn cuffs!
Danny, if someone is trying to kidnap you, you're allowed to use deadly force. They're trying to kidnap you.
I think the duck tape hack hit close to home for Nick and his escape from Kurtis’ basement
When the shot went to black and white while Danny was being choked I thought we were gonna be hit with a ‘wasted’
I’m loosing my shit over this video I cannot stop laughing
Nicks commitment to the glasses over the mask was top tire
I’m sorry I’m fucking CRYING at the mouth hole on the ski mask (no idea what it’s called) when Nick put it on
Is that a Jojo reference!
My school forensics teacher taught us that you can also do the duct tape hack with zip ties
5:54 that photo creeps me the f out.
9:07 so nobody is talking about the naked mannequin in the corner??
lol
28:05 “did you make that video?” “What’s up?” LMAOO
Thanks now I know to use more than 3 layers of duct-tape when kidnapping:)
Add a public comment...
Danny and Nick do bondage pt 1
DNI if you’re a kidnapper
9:53 I got really scared when they said boo! Because coincidentally a mirror fell right at that moment and shattered :/
danny did you dye your hair
Куда я попала
See a good man like me would never do something like this because I would never be kidnapped because I’m that cool
Isn't that true
9:11 he's not gonna acknowledge the giant naked barbie doll in the background??
I had to pause for a second before realizing this is not Drew, holy shit
That's the kinda knot you'd tie, you fuckin square
I can't stand her voice in the troom videos
Yeah twisting someone’s head can kill them
It’s so funny to me how troom troom used to do semi regular hacks and they would only record the hack being done but now all of a sudden they added all this skit crap to it they trynna make it a whole damn movie LMAO 😂😭
that breathing one is a real tactic
At 2:12 they're are some words in different languages that don't have a word in our language so they usually just change the word into something similar.
"get lost dude these are ours!" had me cracking up
E
Danny is a living vine
im sick of the troom troom voice and just wanna nap
I actually knew about the duct tape thing already. Duct tape has three layers: polyester, cotton, and an extremely strong adhesive which is why it works so well. It does however have a weakness which is stress so when you tense your muscles and lit your hands above your head, and pull your hands apart quickly, it rips the tape. That’s why that hack works.
"I felt like I was choking you for a while there like-" "Yeah you WERE" I lost it at this
nick: "dude this is so gross i dont know why anyone would watch this" 3 million people: *youd be suprised*
Theory: in an ultimate universe Danny is the voice behind troom troom
Is it just me or is the narrotor's voice for the Troom Troom EXTREMELY annoying.
I didn’t think I could like you more and then I see that marvelous Niner hat!
Skylar has mad Stockholm syndrome
How fucking annoying the Troom Troom dubbers are. At least 123 Go ones try to make a good voice acting
I’m glad there was some actual advice in this video :3
Why does the narrators voice remind me of Minnie mouse😂😂
He has a Tesla
9:23 if he tries to grab you, FINISH HIM!
Lol it's 11 pm right now
I think troom troom runs by a couple of escaped mental hospital patients or something
I was laughing so hard when Danny was being choked
Danny... How do you know theyre so awful? Do you have BETTER hacks?
Hi you are my favourite now 😽
10/10 meme 1clap
13:25 GRIFFITH!
Are you telling me a rhino shield case can survive kidnapping? That’s pretty epic
I think the scariest moment in the video for Danny was when he jokingly called for Alexa and actually got an answer.
Kevin the kidnapper kinda looks like Call Me Kevin and that makes perfect sense to me.
Okay pleas please do your next video on the new movie free guy or just watch it it’s literally the best movie ever like seriously
I think Nikki Tutorials did great as the kidnap victim...is there **anything** that girl can't do...🥰🥰
Pov: Danny trying to escape Obamas dungeon
-Danny: coughs- SIX FEET AWAY! SIX FEET AWAY!
im so happy to be a greg new acount but ive been a greg for 2 years
When he’s on the chair he looks like me on the toilet
I think that troom troom just had like a big box and needed to use it for a video and thought of one visual gag and just ran with it
This is Danny’s funniest video since “POV I’m ur vampire dad” 😭😭😭😭😭
13:54 The inclusion of "for free" made this the funniest line in the video.
STREET SMARTS
I have contacted the Police and they are on their way to save Danny from his mortal peril.
5:26 guys guns dont kill people...i do
11/10 for using sims 3 music in the background at the beginning
are we not gonna talk abt the socks w toes at 3:08? im crying laughing
5:36 based and pro-gunpilled
the person on the right looks EXACTLY like my french teacher 16:01
Bejng obsessed with true crime there are so many places where this couldve turned very very dark very very fast-
My ad for this was never gonna give you up
why she say martin like that
I hate the mickie mouse voice of the troom troom narrator
27:13 you can actually do this! You have to raise your arms up,the pull them as hard as possible towards your gut! I have TESTED this, because i was curious!
Hey bestie, I just wanna let you know that Arrivederci means goodbye in Italian
It’s now or never! uwu
I like this *Nick* guy.
why the toe socks
I am really happy your talking to me
And if all else fails?  Kill your captors. Just kill them.
him coughing constantly in the craft part is so funny to me for some reason
How much are they payed to act that out... 💀
23:48
19:06 😀
9:08 hold up what is that mannequin
Hol’ up— what happened to the normal narrator? *Troom Troom narrator where did you go*
i love dannys videos, i have been a fan for years, i have bought merch. but i cannot sit through this video. i have been trying to do it for so long and the voice is just so painful i fucking cant
Literally cry laughing.
Tying people up and foot stuff? Damn this channel's gotten good.
Getting really sick of the lady's voice over
I’m gonna guess that troom troom won’t use fabric glue is because it take a long while to dry :D
Danny is kinky
bro the sims music ugh love that game
0:22
0:21
25:40 "I feel like I was choking you for awhile their" "Yeah you were" *plays dramatic music*     I swear best line in this video!!! 😂 It's like watching a drama show.
The didn't even tie one of her feet to the chair in the first hack   She could just gotten up and done it with her hands
When in a headlock get low and push the chin away from you, when the assailant's grip loosens make a break for it.
I just need a "friend" to tie me up - Danny Gonzalez
11:24 I basically felt it’s supposed to stick to things.
why tf is there the sims 3 music in the background?? isnt it copyrighted??
dremmmmmmmmmmmm-m
8:37 what... did he really just sniff the chains??
Im having to turn this video off 1/3 of the way through because I physically cannot take any more of the troom troom narrator voice
Me after attempting anything at all: 13:01
lol i remember i was with my cousins and he said he could escape from a zip tie on his wrist and then it put it really tight and my uncle had to cut him out and then we did it looser and he could
10:18 "How much force I would have to put into throwing it back to crush someone"
15:34 Danny do be looking like my indian aunt
Nick is way taller than I thought
31:15 👁 👄 👁
this made my day
Really missed an opportunity to call it “Getting Kinky With Troom Troom”
Watching this as someone who is actually been kidnapped is unrealistically hilarious, I expected to be angry the whole time but this is so out of touch I just feel like a caveman is explaining technology to me
Her hand cuffs are zip ties around her wrist… Connected by a rubber band…
Give me your…self
4:40 when I tell you I was not REMOTELY prepared
danny: *acts like a kid*  Nick: *acts like a adult*  together they are... FaMILy
Isnt the easier solution to the scarf hack just....looking at ur back seat before u get in the car?
Young Guns!
*arevadirchie*
Hold up - Danny is 27????????
That duct tape hack is amazing
your crafting corner is not a corner >:(   very upsetting, 2.5 stars
Thanks, now it will be easier for me to kidnap people
Surely Troom Troom knows that a lot of modern cars have manual releases for the trunk, inside the trunk.
The voice is far too cheery for what's going on.
I don’t think the neck snap would work because you don’t have enough leverage to snap it but idk
i'm an egg
sims2  music?
WHY DOES THE NARRATOR SOUND LIKE THEYRE TRYNA BE MICKEY MOUSE LMAOOO
love the sims 3 music at the beginning
you both are the same type of awkward
react to “Something Strange About the Johnson’s”
Giggled so much at this, thank u
I didn't think troom troom could get worse, wtf is up with that voice???
the toe socks look like a split tongue
why is there sims 3 music playing really quietly in the background??
UR SO FUNNY LMFAOO
Gosh dammit. Gotta hate those budget kidnappers 28:55
4:45 I can’t believe Troom Troom got Steven Ogg in a video
ARRIVEDERCI SEE YOU SOON
Still Doesn't change the fact that I suffer for a witch not to live.
"MAR-IN" kill me please.
Life Hack: Eat Taco Bell to make  birth way easier.🤓
The survival video seemed legit because TROOM TROOM STOLE EVERY HACK WORTH LISTENING TO. Lmao. Classic TROOM TROOM
IDK why you wouldn't smash the seat back while beeing strangled to use the guys strength against him sense he is pulling you backwords.
I've been very unhealthy mentally recently and I just want to say thank you for making me laugh every day.
Was thinking about unsubscribing but then he comes out with this masterpiece
"If you are getting kidnaped in a car than just get out of the car" Ah yes! *If you are dying then just be alive*
Arribedutschi!
Matches don't light from being struck on walls anymore
Has anyone realized that there is a naked doll in the background of the video yet?
I am watching this at 6:20 in the damn morning trying not,to laugh and it is bout the hardest thing to do Lol
Arrivederci means goodbye
Honestly, watching Nick and Danny just having a great time together is so entertaining.
Danny is really serving me “1950-1960’s All-American Guy” here.
help let me go. stop kidnapping me
3:08 the toe socks were a shock to my system
Estaba viendo el video a lado de alexa y cuando le preguntó sobre el arrivederci, mi alexa tmb se activo (esta programada  en ingles, y no se como moverle, lol)
idk why but i really thought this was gonna be hacks for actually kidnapping a person...
3:09 what the hell are those socks
i am laughing so hard
Troom Troom: Are you tied up with scotch tape? PERFECT!-    What the- HOW IS THAT PERFECT?! YOU SOUND SO EVIL RIGHT NOW TROOM TROOM-
Is ur brother Rebal d
The way they said "ARE YOU GETTING STRANGLED?"  Sounded so casual like it happens every Tuesday
Are you tied up with scotch tape? PERFECT!
Alexis Rose taught me the duct tape wrist trick
And so the saga continues
I thought this video was about how to kidnap someone :/ severely disappointed 1/10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
your mother also hi charlie <3
t o e s o c k s
danny specifically specified that he wouldn’t show his bare feet online for *free*  so is his wikifeet behind a paywall or something
The randy mash sound clip.
imagine opening one of these videos to help you and it just goes "AYO THEYRE TRYING TO ESCAPE BRUH" LMAOOOO
If u actually do get kidnapped go CRAZY like piss yourself start kicking biting whatever you can think  do it.
I suffer for a witch not to live.
17:47 The fact that Troom Troom thought a kidnapper would just randomly be playing with matches- TroomTroom is just using some very unlikely situations-
its not skotch tape, its duct tap- no its NOT skotch tape its duct tape :l
Danny looks fire in a scarf
the background music sounds like Sims?????
9:00 this is how magicians escape from straitjackets pretty much every time
watching one of my worst fears as a woman play out on screen while funky music bops in the background was truly a *cursed experience*
Smh you got my Alexa yelling and shit
where’s the tv danny😱😱😱😅‼️‼️‼️⁉️⁉️
This was hilarious. When I saw Nick enter the chat I knew it was going to be even funnier
Did Troom Troom go thru some staff turnovers because … this girls voice is even more annoying than the original. Which I didn’t think would be possible to do. Also, I’ve now began to narrate my life like a Troom Troom video so … that’s happening now.
Danny saying, “that’s actually really funny” with a look of pain and disappointment on his face…he’s going through it with Troom Troom 😔
Next thing they be teaching you how to decorate the kidnapper’s house
6:19  escape through the window ?No-! Throw a blanket Over your head and dance around! OMG SHES TOO DUMB TO LIVE!!! 🙄🤬🤬🤯
What type of acid trip is this??
how troom troom gets their actors   kidnapping them eg. "That's genius kevin!" how did she know his name? "great job martin!" again, how?!
The weird thing is the first video when she got out of the zip ties she just opened the gate and walked out is the gate supposed to be locked because it was not .         And also:look at all those “criminals”!the criminals:🔫🔪
Troom troom is a world where safety matches haven't been invented yet
Why does their TV have a gloryhole in it?
3:09 look at her socks🥲
I like how they somehow could afford a PS5 clock the controller but not a fucking 200$ at most TV. Sure, sure.
What made me laugh is the fact that you never try and rip what someone is strangling you with. You lay your seat back (giving space to slip out) and then you get out. They just added a step that with kill you. Troom troom truly is great😂
At exactly 13:05 I blew a fat bong rip directly onto my screen 🌬️💨 😂
Now we *KNOW* groom groom is “absurdist comedy”     No I’m not changing the autocorrect because the irony with the topic made me laugh
anyone know where the green frog t-shirt is from
what did they do to the narration? why did they add sound effects? this hurts my ears it’s like a bad mobile game ad
1:28 This is the voice you hear when you enter hell
Fun fact! You can also break duct tape around your ankles by standing crossed legged and bending your knees with force. (I’ve tried it and it works!) Thank tik tok for than one
Is nobody going to mention that girls terrifying toe socks?
PRAY FOR WORLD PEACE!!!❤️❤️💕 God bless u!!!
They could have at least tried to teach kids about how modern cars have a latch of some sort to open the trunk
PRAY FOR WORLD PEACE!!!❤️❤️💕 God bless u!!!
gOtcHa GirLY!
why does the troom troom narrator sound like a middle school boy that's having voice cracks...
Some pieces of advice, if someone kidnaps you, pull the handbrake, and or squeeze their balls till they break, it is actually a lot easier than you would think
What's with the troom troom voice
There is a reason people don’t use fabric glue….
When your ankles are taped Cross your feet And squat/sit down The pressures will break every tape
Please make criminals are guns merch, I would buy
How is also watching like in the middle of the night I can’t be the only one
4:40
This is concerning but funny at the same time.
That high pitched voice makes me want to kidnap myself
29:24  why was someone  filming the cameraman???
Him saying Alexa what does Arrivederci turned on my Alexa which told me what it meant
oh-
you need a specific type of match to be able to light it against a wall, i dunno if you bought the right type :3
usually if a person is hiding in your car they'll  probally just shoot you through the chair
Testing troom trooms awful hacks [ real title] troom troom killed me with black fuzz because I tested their life hacks
The hold the breath and the duct tape hacks are genuine good ideas, good on u troom troom.
I was dying of laughter the whole time
Bro video’s fire. Do more of this
the troom troom narrator in the first bit sounds like Baby J
14:56
ngl that whole ski mask thing they did is comedic genius
Yo those TroomTroom videos were wild but that duck tape hack is awesome
I'm crying and dying of laughter
Are Rod and Tod Flanders narrating Troom Troom videos now?
Hell Hell
Oho oho
"Zip tie me" sounds weirdly sexual like he has a kidnap fetish XD
omg when you made the ski mask 😭😭😭😭 i couldn’t stop laughing
Why are girls always kidnapped in these videos? If you are a girl that doesn't mean that you can't defend yourself. Some girls even bring pepper spray or something like that for extra security .
Nick was the best choice for a kidnapper. I feel best educated by this pairing.
3:08 DID SHE HAVE INDVIDUAL TOES ON HER SOCKS sorry for yelling... WHAT THE F****
This could have been so different
It’s pronounced arieva DACHI
Nick kinda fine... can he ziptie me?
I love how the narrator of a kidnapping video is a baby
"Ok and now I crush his bones"
9:58 jokes on you, i dont wear scarves
From now on, i'm calling weapons criminals
This was so funny. You don’t know how much I needed this laugh, crying laughing and then just crying. Thanks
They have too much fun with all of these sets like 😏
WAS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
I cannot STAND her voice jesus christ
did Mickey Mouse narrate this video?
Emily must have beaten a mobile game and that’s why she was legally allowed to leave
willing to bet this video awoke something in someone
What the fuck is happening on Troom Troom? Honest to god, this is filmed in Russia, right? WTF is up with these sets? Why is the voiceover so goddamn happy? I have so many questions and I want none of the answers.
I though nick was benoftheweek🧍‍♀️
Ask mrbeast to be in his squid games
The fact that in one video the kidnappers get a PlayStation and the next video they have a PlayStation but no TV implies that, instead of a job, whenever the kidnappers want something they just go ahead and kidnap people. True bros.
9:48 yes that kills people it is called snapping a neck or something like that
the narrator kinda changed, she sounds a bit more... annoying
I have so many questions about the dungeon. Fuckin gold bars, wood floor, brand new toilet. Gotta be able to take them insta selfies while u in the clink I guess.
1:29 That’s literally a vine sound but just auto tuned
Ok the the duct tape hack I’ve actually see people do with gorilla tape (which is like strong duct tape), sometimes it’ll take a few tries if you have lots of tape but it’s like a real non-Troom-Troom hack
DANNY PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FEMOMETER ADS THEYRE SCARING ME
Gods sake you set off my Alexa
Did that man sniff the chains?
There are matches that light only against the box and matches that light with any friction. Danny, did you get the right matches?
These troom troom videos are insane. There’s no way it’s not satire.
stockholm syndrome: The movie  also danny just has such female eyes, like, it looks kind of unintimidating when he looks at you with the ski mask. It's just cute
5:37 I thought Danny was gonna make a Goldie Lookin Chain reference even though I know that he wouldn't know who that is 🤣
guys look at the thumbnail, do u remember ‘dreaming of a day where u die in a fire and i get all ur subscribers’  GUYS DREWS GETTING US TRUE GREGS
Aw maaan, I thought we were gonna learn hacks for how to kidnap people
A
I think somehow troom troom confused zip ties with tape and then got different kinds of tape confused as well
Danny obviously none of these would actually work unless you screamed “help let me go” a bunch of times
not so fun fact ive almost been kidnapped twice
“Are you tied up with scotch tape?”…..,    PERFECT
‘straighten yourself’  gay people 👁👄👁
'Arrivederci' basically means 'see you later' so... not the best choice
Today troom troom taught me that if someone ever tries to trap me in my room I'll just go into toddler brain and wear my comforter
CRUSH HIM
i love the crudely drawn mortal kombat on the cardboard tv at 6:50
Graduated with comp sci, crafting is still hard hehe
the absolutely chaotic energy of danny renting a garage and bringing a friend over with no explanation, only to reveal they're trying out kidnapping hacks...
Stockholm syndrome really hits hard
*me listening to the video while playing sims 4*  Huh, something sounds familiar... *looks around*  I'm not playing sims 3, where is that music coming from-
arrivederci is goodby in Italian, its pronounced as arrevedchi
15:34 why does he lowkey look like jared rushton in the weirdest way
Danny this is the funniest video you’ve ever made
the new troom troom narrator reminds me of varlis daughters
Kidnapped victim in a bedroom with CHAINS and the kidnapper is in love with her.....  Yo those vibes are BAD 😭
PLZ react to the After movie series... you look just like the main guy
ArEeVaDeRcHiE losers- Danny 2021
Obsessed with Nicks hair sticking out of the eye holes 😂
Troom Troom's 2021 family-friendly video about Stockholm Syndrome.
do one where you kill people with rocks
Hot take but the "that's the best way to be" is because he was relieved y'all weren't setting off fireworks
Why do they have a female manikin? That’s pretty sus especially for men
your next video should be trying troom trooms murdering people hacks
The Troom Troom narrator's voice is like a drill designed specifically for eardrums Jesus H. Christ
Breaking the tape was pretty bad-ass
11:51 love the intro “Are you getting fussing strangled?”
* Throws Skyler on bed *     *I think we all know where this is going.*
Why does Nick remind me of Wilbur Soot if he weren't from the uk-
Those Troom Troom videos do not need Danny in order to be fucking hilarious But the fact that Danny was there made it so much better
I’m
the last minute bye while falling 😭
that duck tape one dose work my dad is in the military and tough us that but you have to be really strong
I think it’s obvious what’s going on here. Skyler has a kidnapping kink that’s only fully experienced if she uses unconventional means, including seducing one of her kidnappers, to escape by herself. She does this all the time and is showing her appreciation for the kidnappers for always going along with her kink by giving them a TV. She probably gives them all sorts of gifts in return for them bringing her fantasies to life.
I just like how his eyes miss the lens every single time by like less than an inch no matter how close he is to the camera
9:42 yes that is. Very real trick. Sensei Steve taught me.
she had a phone but did not call police😶
I'm guessing next we will have a break the tape challenge lol
Guys I can confirm none of these work like I’ve never done that while kidnapping a child
13:53 so he would do it for money tho
Little did he know, the Alexa was a gift Danny bought for his kidnapper out of appreciation
16:23 NOT HIM POSING LMFAO
Oh troom troom- you never fail to disgust me :)
Another way to break out of being choked by a car is putting the car seat back onto their legs so their hands are onto their legs so you could escape
i'm actually shook at the duct tape thing omg
9:08 bottom left corner        I thought troomtroom was for kids
The troom troom video Just felt SO disrespectful!
Why do I want him to make an only fans
these survival hack videos are significantly worse than everything else troom troom makes
For the tape one you are supposed to stand up straight and put your legs shoulder with apart and if you swing your arms straight back and you elbows go next to your hip you can split it (idk if I that made sense)
Danny’s Bruno Bucciarati era
Troom Troom should rename the video. Instead if kidnapping lifehacks, it should be "How not to commit a kidnapping if you actually want to accomplish something."
Me with my electric car seat, aw man
Breathing in can help, but it doesn't always help
and they lived happily ever after
ITS A R I V E D E R C I
Idk why both of you breaking out of the duct tape made me so happy
21:53 that made me laugh so much
Ok but why was her socks basically toe gloves
Did they change voice actors? Because now instead of sounding like a normal person they're talking like GoOd jOB MaRtiN!
I learnt more about kidnapping then escaping
9:10 is that a jojo reference    11:48 srsly
This video did not help the people I kidnapped escape whatsoever
Missed opertunity to wear his Santa ski mask he used for his music video
Danny! Please review this low budget movie I just watched called Bullied! It's an Australian movie about some middle schoolers with a crazy premise and it came out this year,,it has its own IMBd page too.
Oh Danny boi they weren’t meant to be taken literally
The editing style is on point✨
"Smells like Wal-Mart in here"   I don't know why but I laughed so hard that I ended up coughing and crying with laughter.
Just get out the car then KILL THEM
YO DANNY HAS ANOTHER FROG SHIRT HELL YEAH
THE NARRORATORS VOICE IS SO BAHAHHAHA
19:51 sus
Fucking hell Nick is pretty af
"This might actually work, it's making a match sound."
It wasnt exactly like that but Mark and Ethan tried the duck tape hack themselves on Unus Annus and it worked
13:37 im sorry but thats what she said
adding that square knot joke to my repertoire
i hate how women wanting to protect themselves has become like a trend, it spreads false information which could get someone killed
That duct tape one.... actually is useful.
24:00 discount Batman and Robin. 🤪
The kidnapper will probably be embarrassed that he kidnapped someone who watches life hacks from troom troom
HE SAID US
Christ. Her voice.
Reasons to wear toe socks for the rest of your life.
"even if your arms break or your wrist breaks something breaks or your crying your bleeding" - Nick 2021
i cant be the only one who finds “you have nice skin… for a youtube” absolutely hilarious
To find toe-socks, go to WOMENS/GIRLS hosiery…boys departments only have mitten socks, not glove socks.
Skylar be like: I would rate this dungeon a 4.5 out of 5, the kidnappers were really nice, they even played games with me! But it was a bit boring. Definitely would go again.
I love how there was another pair of hand helping her burn the plasticy cuffs.
Life hack when someone kidnap you:        Say: STOP KIDNAPPING ME
22:53 Its Hip to be square
3:09 CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS SOCKS-
YASSSSSS NICK
I always thought Nick was short… guess not lmao
when is the face reveal danny?
Imagine they actually reply lol
Did they change the narrator?
Her voice is too annoying, can't watch this im sorry
Yes Danny, snapping someone's neck will indeed kill them
This was fun to watch! I like you  and Nick lol
Trumtrum jojo fans
Duct tape is fabric and fabric actually tears pretty well.
The snap neck thing I so wrong, I was in marshal arts and that is not correct
Why he smell the chain?
I laugh way to hard at all your videos
I woke up at 4am panicked cause I thought the nutcracker guy wasn't in your videos anymore... phew...
Troom Troom scares me 😭...*_and this explains why_*
UR FRIEND WAS FUNNY... U SHOULD DO MORE VIDS WITH HIM...
Omg that smirk while wearing the scarf was everything
How do you even think of toe socks 😭
I’m amazed the writers didn’t have Emily help the kidnappers with their car by showing them a troom troom car fixing hack.
that beautiful montage will never fade out of my memory 24:30
They actually show troom troom's kidnapping video at FBI training to educate about the dangers of Stockholm syndrome
hahaha gimme your-self!
This is weirdly worse than their older videos
I'm pretty sure I learned that duct tape one from Schitt's Creek. Glad to see it actually works 😅
12:46  the whole bit-  I have never laughed so hard at a video
15:14 Jewish parents when they have a boy
Mr. TroomyDan
When he winked i fainted like actually fainted
troom troom has some sus ra*ey vibes in this one.
who else likes to watch the troom troom channel on roku tv when they don’t want to think 🙋🏻‍♀️
DO NOT DO THE HACK AT 10:30 UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY INJURE YOUR WRISTS OR SHOULDERS IF YOU FAIL TO RIP THE TAPE AND ISE TOO MUCH FORCE
“Gotcha girly” 👧🏻💖💅🏼
Stockholm syndrome in a nutshell
Captain America who? Danny America now.
When u called out Alexa, my Alexa legitimately answered the same question lol
I'm fuckin crying at the car seat reclining
OH DWEAMMMM
6:02 lol
I saw the duck tape one like 5 years ago on project Mc2 (squared) (like a knot) (and Danny’s kidnapper)
LOL
The tape hack actually works depends on how tough the tape is tho
hack 4 works. You need to pretty much slam your elbows into the sides of your ribs after holding your hands above your head and the instant pressure breaks the duct tape.
I was imitating the “rarararah” that the kidnapper did and my mom asked if I was ok…💀
take ur grandpas hat off
Cute
Ariva-durchee sounds like a greeting on The Sims
8:09 ???
Why is nicks neck longer than my lifespan
The troom troom voice sounds like mickey mouse on drugs and helium at the same time
If someone gets you in a headlock there’s an easy fix for that! JUST SNAP THEIR NECK.
SIMS MUSIC!!!
I love the picture of the kidnappers as babies too 😂😂  If they didn’t kill me, that picture would’ve.. or still them after I laughed at the picture lol
Ive heard of the duct tape trick from numerous sources for ways to escape and ppl trying it irl so i knew it was gonna work
Them recreating the second hack got me laughing unreasonably hard
you guys have a great dynamic together
"yOu GoT nIcE sKiN"
okay but what is nick's tee?? like walmart shareholder?? but with a spanish AND catalonian flag??? am i missing some essential walmart history class??
We just gonna ignore the "sus" doll in the background at around 9:12
How many times has Nick been kidnapped since he knows these tricks better than Troom Troom?
Danny I want to watch this so badly but the new narrator's voice is causing me pain
I got so annoyed cuz I felt like Danny was doing the tape thing wrong that I literally paused and duct taped my own hands using my teeth (it’s like 3 am, no one else is awake) and long story short my wrists hurt really bad ans are bleeding
Is that a jOjO reference!!!!!!
16:23 Didn't expect Batman to be on the video!! He looks a bit skinny without the suit tho
Wtf did i kiddnaped someone cuz my name is martin xdd
Great vid Danny, honestly couldn’t watch it. Troom trooms too weird
I haven't even watched the video yet and I can tell I am going to laugh at least 10 times.
Things I said during this video: "Carllllll that kills people!" "But my seats are automated they go back so slooooow..." "The cap. The capppppp!" "The scarf. Which he apparently always wears. lol-" "Hehehe Scotch tape-"
Hi Danny. I love your videos and hope you keep uploading I thought this video was hilarious but I haven’t been able to get a account since now. Your videos are awesome keep up the good work
|     O      |           *Ho ho ho ho*  \     |     /        / \      /      \
9:16
When your phone is so cheap no one makes cases for it
Damn dude nick is a LOT taller than I expected haha
If I had a dollar for every time the narrators voice cracked…
hahahahahahahaha i like his vids its funny to wach QwQ
Are we gonna talk about that doll in the background? 9:10
i would literally just drive off with the kidnapper.
The scariest thing about Troom Troom is that someone may believe that these videos are actually useful life hacks. D:
I don't think I can finish my homework now
The sims music is everything 🤣😂
Gatcha girlie✨❤️🤪😘
Good job Kevin           t h a t s a f e l o n y
I keep on forgetting that Danny isn’t 19
Love the boldness of never drawing out the design before cutting things out, always free styling
I keep
with the duck tape you're supposed to pull your wrists apart at the same time, that's why it didn't work.
The duck tape thing does actually work my mom used to tape me and my sisters up and get us to escape so we would know what to do if we got kidnapped 😅😅👍
I was watching this with my grandma and she looked up and said “he’s got pretty hair” I can’t tell if this was a compliment or threat so I wish you luck
Anyone know where to get the Chicago sweatshirt Danny is wearing??
i can just imagine someone called greg clicking on your video from their recommended, not knowing who you are and being freaked out by you knowing their name-
Yea
21:12 For those who want to see Danny slowly turn into a fat tomato 🍅
That first video was not well thought-out at all and makes it seem like kidnappers don't do terrible things to people.   The second one isn't downplaying how serious this kind of situation is, and I seriously hope that the first one wasn't more recent, or else Troom Troom are sending the wrong message...
9:25  You need 1,000 lbs of pressure to snap a human neck, dont worry bout him
2:05 i was genuinely clapping
What frightens me the most is those socks with individual toes
Yeah that thing with the neck fucking kills ya
Finally found a time I could set 30 minutes aside to watch this.
Why do I always forget that there's another person filming
"That makes no sense to my eyes." 😂
the wannabe mickey mouse narrators voice is making my blood boil lol
A square know for anyone uninitiated is basically when you do a normal knot but do right over left then left over right or vice versa (yes, it’s so easy that I’d bet many readers already do it naturally). It just makes the knot a square shaped where each side is supporting the other instead of creating a normal loop and a sideways loop, which is more likely to fall out. A square knot is also easier to untie if you know how to untie it. If you tie knots even somewhat regularly, you’ll probably want to learn a square knot since it’s so easy yet effective. In fact, if you do something similar to a square knot with your shoe strings, you end up with a knot that doesn’t come undone accidentally (a single square knot is less likely to come undone than a double non-square knot). If you want to know more about the shoe tying thing, look up Going Deep with David Reece shoe tying method and it hopefully will pop up.
13:36 that’s what she said
Good👍
The way I actually was amazed that the tape one worked, lookin like the surprised Pikachu meme and shit😭
The reason they all defend the kidnappers is so that the kidnappers will allow you to watch it while you’re being held hostage. Genius!
Danny is taking troom troom life hacks on a whole other level
Nice to see Nick, always liked him
ⓗⓔⓛⓟ
a y o
8:34 why did the kidnapper sniff the chain?!🤣
Danny and his dupatta at 24:30 looking better than all us south Asians
helpful tip: if zip-tied in the front, use your teeth to tighten them down as much as possible, and the "scotch-tape method" works the same (make sure your wrists go directly over your waist line using your pelvis and hips. not your stomach)
He's not gonna expose he's feet to us for FREE... 🤔
No one’s gonna talk about her socks?…..
Laura: he’s probably out there cheating on me Danny: yeah the square knot is a real knot!
These ex-vine channels are almost just as bad as the lifehack channels and just as unfunny
i never would’ve assumed kidnappers were nice enough to help you escape
ahahahkkack
I mean he's not wrong 8:28
Robby reference
"I'm scared. 😉 🐸"
the energy in this video
"It's boring? You're in a dungeon, _DUDE,_ have a little sense of urgency! Look, I'd be scared enough being kidnapped, but come to find out the kidnappers have a *_dungeon?_* I would be about a thousand times more worried when I find out they have a dungeon. In the basement. This is definitely not their first rodeo, they've definitely been planning this for _a while..."_
The inhale thing was used in the hardy boys once
You have never looked so white <3  Edit: please know this is a joke
why is mickey mouse telling us how to escape a kidnapping?
i miss the end song so much :(
Don’t try to clean your room while watching Danny, it’s too funny😂
Just hit them, against the chair.?  Then my wrists would be broken, and I'd STILL be trapped.
this was so funny I was dying the whole time. also love the moment of triumph at the end
9:08 why the fuck do the kidnappers have a fucking mannequin in their room
Danny smells like Walmart in here lol
okay this is so random but the moment I start watching Danny my bird starts chirping and I've decided that Danny is the next snow white
13:32 danny the turtle😂😂😂
Um... the driver seat in my car doesn’t go back, so... I’m screwed. 🤷🏽‍♀️
I have not laughed this hard at something in awhile
ngl i thought that there was a dobre brother in the thumbnail LMFAO
That first video's narrator made me want to stab chopsticks in my eardrums
AH HES BACK GOT ME BRUH
That whole sequence of events from 24:23 - 25:05 was the MOST hilarious thing I’ve ever seen
“She got long legs Jack Skellington”
Lol y’all didn’t buy strike anywhere matches 😆
Conspiracy theory: Greg is Danny’s crush and he makes these videos to impress Greg.
I'm sorry but the voice was so annoying I couldn't even concentrate on the video, and I have severe Overload sensitivity to high pitched Sounds so I It was kind super annoying for nothing lmao
Me: amazed that Troom Troom was actually right about the getting out of the trunk thing because every car has a way to open the trunk from the inside.
22:21 made me laugh so fucking hard
So science fair idea, how many layers of tape
9:10 What is that damn mannequin doing there???? Also I love how the barrels say: TOXIC! 🤣
4:38 i lost it lmaoooo
7:00 Stockholm syndrome
The wink tho
before watching troom troom: level 1 prisoner after watching troom troom: level 10000000000000 danny gonzalez
Danny and nick goofing off in the streets the man passing by concerned : " whatcha doin ? " - danny : " trying those stupid life hacks " - stranger "oh ok" those boomers and their life hacks
have...you never ripped duct tape with your hands before?
pov: you got killed by mikey mouse
It all makes sense now.. who in their right mind would willingly participate in a troom troom video. They need help!
Danny, your shoes are ugly
I would love to watch all of it, but... that voice
3:33 Your telling me you did not see her hand
Danny cutting up the mask is like the exact joke from django unchained with the kkk members
This narrator, man. 😂 I just can’t stand the voice. The title of this video kinda sounds like Danny’s trying to learn how to perform kidnappings rather than escape them.
9:07 why was that in the background lol
Me: I want vemon my mom: We have venom at home Venom at home: 13:30
is nobody talking about the fact that she just happened to be wearing toe socks- 💀
This video killed me
Ok but like. The troom troom narrator voice has always been annoying. But I feel like it’s gotten worse?  Because at least before it was kind of tolerable? Obviously not someone you want to narrating a documentary, but it was passable for shitty, stupid little useless life hacks. But now it’s really hard to watch? It sounds like she’s constantly trying to do her bad ‘man’ voice and I hate it so much.
There are ways to actually break out of restraints. If I'm being held hostage, I'm breaking out of the restraints but not leaving. Kidnappers usually have guns or a knife, so I'm gonna at least make myself comfortable.  Obviously you gotta try to reason with the criminals in a way that's de-escaltory.  Usually if a kidnapped person tries to fight back, they die.
It seems Danny forgot about the ski mask he used in “I’m gonna kill Santa Claus”
The Sims music in the background ayyyyyy 😁
Did Kurtis film this
The duck tape hack is really well known a guy who tests gear for emergencies did it
Respect for the robbers cause they were playing mortal kombat
is this the Poughkeepsie Tapes?
Arrevadurchy, losers!
I learned to hold my breath from Ninjago. Sensei Wu was my Troom Troom.
All of troomtroom's employees are kidnapped. /srs
Danny in a scarf while being kidnapped 😍
Can we talk about the fact that she’s wearing toe socks
Arrivedechi? Reminds me of someone....
What criminals are good at arts and crafts? John Wayne Gacy
I waited four days to watch this because I felt like I was having a break in reality two days after I commented on the previous Troom Troom video, "Danny you still haven't made the deep dive into that kidnapping video like you said you would. We're waiting. (paraphrased)" like, I thought I was a little Greg, but this power over Danny is too much Greg for me to handle.
8:07 there's a weird error that makes it look like she's opening the criminals
Life hack? more like save your life hack
Yo wtf. That TroomTroom channel is fucken weird !! Im sure its being targeted to kids and its fucken weird and scary that kids might actually be watching that!!
Danny why did you steal less white Kurtis
The neck thing would not work it takes so much more force to snap a neck
So this channel is for children and were teaching them to use objects they likely can't safely use. People will probably do this to their siblings and see if the sibling can get out. My sister did that to me cuz she was bored, tied me to a chair and put me in the closet. And of course teaching them how to snap people's necks
The eyeholes being cut perfectly to COVER his eyes has to be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen lmfaooo
"GoTcHyA, gIrLiE."
20:45 why is there a hand
Bro why is no one talking about his hair in the outro it looks colored dude
Am I the only one who heard the SIMS theme tune in the background? 💀
So do you think Danny pitched this video to Nick? Did he just call him up like, "So, how do you feel about kidnapping?"
By the way, only strike anywhere matches can be lit against a wall. All they need is friction, but regular matches need the strike strip
I'm surprised troom troom hasn't started making porn yet
Arrivederci is italian, it means goodbye
why does she talk like that......
Thank you
Why does the narrator sounds like eugina cooney
At this point danny and troom troom have a symbiotic relationship in the YouTube ecosystem. Idk how to feel about that
Did no-one else notice the sims music????????
Danny we have the same last name
The whole part where they test the scarf hack had me 💀
Why is the narrator attempting a Minnie Mouse voice on the first video?
horses do that trick from the second video: they'll take a deep breath before you put the saddle on them so that when they exhale, it's looser. When you're about to ride you're supposed to tighten the saddle so it doesn't slip off
That narrator really be like   ItS KiNda GLoOmy iN hEerE  HeEr’es a TV for yoU
6:07 do you think the wedding was a shot gun wedding
Danny out of context: Danny:im just imagining how hard it would be to throw it back *two seconds later* Now from the top make it drop thats some wet
Omg perfect for all my kidnapping needs!
Narrator's voice is pretty damaged :')
Pro tip: just bite the zip tie off don’t melt it and potentially breath in plastic
"danny i feel like i'm choing you" danny: *fighting for his life*
No joke, always check your back seat before sitting in your car, especially at night
If bandits leave you in a car by yourself for ten minutes you’re legally allowed to leave
These troom troom vids are so insensitive.. I am a kidnap and trafficking survivor and these channels (not your's Danny, talking about Troom Troom) make light of one of the worst things a human can go through. People think you can only get Ptsd from being in the military.. That's not true. i have it so bad I'm afraid of men.. The only exception is men in my family I trust.. I haven't left my house in 6 years unless I absolutely have to and have panic attacks Everytime I do. I get flash backs at random or triggered times (like when someone triggers me.. For example when I tell me not to touch me or send me anything explicit and they still do) and with the flashbacks I'm back in that motel room with a different drugged out man on top of me.. And i still feel like I'm there and unsafe when I stop disassociating.. But Troom Troom makes "Cute" videos obviously aimed at children/Minors giving fake/harmful "tips" to an upbeat vibe and scenario. I'm not upset with your video because you're pointing out how ridiculous their videos are .. But this isn't the only kid/minor aimed channel to do this.. Like imagine if they made a video in the same fashion titled "How to escape getting 'R'-worded" and made it all cutesy like this.. That's basically what they're doing cuz that's how 90% of kidnappings go.
3:09 WTF IS THAAAT
Hey so that snapping neck self defense prob wouldn’t really work cuz they weren’t even choking her, if they were taller then you, you would use a different self defense
13:55 Why did you add "for free" Danny? Why did you add that? You certainly didn't have to. But you did.
It is the Black Hood! Lol
HUhOo hUhOooO
The dislikes are the kidnappers
She bought them a new TV? Poor developed a MASSIVE case of Stockholm Syndrome
That’s how mafia works
Imagine the kidnapper giving u advice on how to brake out😂
Fun fact: the adhesive on duct tape is water soluble, so if someone puts duct tape over your mouth you can just lick it off
I mean yeah of course she had to give the kidnappers their tv otherwise they would have tried to take another girl for the ransom certainly she couldn’t report them to authorities and have them arrested!
lägg ägg
life hack: have your kidnapper ziptie your wrists, and then have the same kidnapper hold a lit match while you melt the zip ties and escape
My little brother watches troom troom and in loud speaker and that high pitch voice of the narrator annoys me for some reason and one day I watched it cuz i was bored then i saw the hacks its ........ clearly for kids
Why is Nick wearing a t-shirt with the Spanish and Catalonian flags? LMAO A Walmart t-shirt with the Spanish and Catalonian!!!
why didn’t you give nick a tv danny
what are with her socks
can you pls grow your hair out. it’s for a science project
this is so fucking funny
I thought the kidnapper in the red shirt was jake t austin
Nobody Danny: Dungen
Was that kurtis filming, I sensed his presence
I had to cut the tip off! DOYYY
I spent the night in the quiet room
The one ab breaking the tape on your wrists also works for zip ties, I’ve tried it before. You gotta use quit a bit of force tho
I love that their first interaction was Nick creeping Danny out and now Nick is kidnapping him
"Guns don't kill people, people kill people but guns help" •some smart dude
I never laughed so hard at someone being choked
circumsize the glue
I wonder if troom troom stans exist
Nick and Danny experiment with bondage.
Oh my god it's been a while since I've watched your videos , this made me laugh so much
a fly in my room at 3 am: 17:33
What in the acid trip 😳
This is the video that convinced me to turn on notifications
Daddy saddle
Stockholm syndrome
Danny kinda a himbo just a lil bit
the narrators voice is so painful to listen to
I could just imagine trying to recline my seat to crush a kidnapper, its one those circle recliners where you have to twist it 🤣
The duck tape thing really opened my eyes, I guess cis men just don’t know this. But I think that’s AFAB peoplE know this shit by heart
You sir are very handsome.  I'm sure you get that a lot. Bro-mance here.   😂
Love this video ❤
gotcha girlie ☺️🌸✨
10:47 I just put this time stamp so I can relive the funnyness over and over
The glasses over the mask is a look
Does nobody care about the rope in Danny’s car? Why does he have a rope?
The first place I’ve heard of the “Hold your breath and tense all your muscles if your getting tied up” is from a Hardy Boys book (I don’t remember which one) I read when I was little. This video resurfaced memories I didn’t know I had of those books.
Troom Troom really grinds my gears. I mean.. I take it way too seriously. Want them all to be jailed up for the shit they're putting out and exposing to kids. Ugh.. okay, on my way to anger management and therapy.
is nick taken..asking for a friend
The narrators voice on the first Video is just driving me insane
These kidnapping hacks may does works 😧😉😏
Bear Grylls will have an aneurysm watching this video.
Aahahahags i love that shot when Danny says yeah you were and the camera just turs away and that's the shot it's so good
I want to know why someone has ALEXA in their Storage locker!
dude imagine bruno said "arrivederci,losers" after he finishes punching
Extra good video
i dropped my phone yesterday into 100,000 peoples
bro i dropped my phone yesterday into 100,000 peoples
that last hack actually was impressive, I thought yeah they probably made a snip in the tape in the video, but it actually worked, finally an actual life hack that could one day be slightly useful
the rope scene looks like a bad parody of a bdsm scene sjdjdjdjj
Damn you've been doing troom troom video's forever
very funny laughed a lot! unfortunately it is causing my recently removed appendix quite a bit of pain but thanks for the chuckles!
The narrator's voice though...
I’m sick 🤣 I cackled so hard to Danny getting choked out 🤣
Did she really give them a tv? StockHolm syndrome much??
So Nick doesn’t know what a square knot is and has never heard “arrivederci” before? Typical “in-their-own-bubble” Gen Z American
The "scotch" tape break trick is actaully a real thing that they teach you in the military.
As a professional kidnapper, I approve.   Seriously though, I fight people and I've been paid to fight people. the self defense ones are complete bullshit. There is nothing you can do to beat someone bigger and stronger than you. I can have all the skills in the world but at the end of the day, I'm not beating someone twice my size.
I can’t tell if The narrator is a guy pretending to be a girl or an actual girl
Maybe the real people we kidnapped were the friends we made along the way
Yeah strike-anywhere matches are a specific kind lol, to troomtroom's credit they seem to have actually used the right ones in the video
d o i
thing is you can use that duct tape trick with zip ties
To be honest I clicked off after the first vid thinking it was over
the scotch tape hack does actually work but its mainly for zipties
Real kidnapping advice:  part 1: the initial encounter  If you notice someone following you and they're getting closer. before they grab you turn around immediately. This will startle throw the kidnapper off their guard because most people run when being followed and they will be expecting you to run.  part 2: the taking  if you're being grabbed go for the eyes and throat (or groin if they are male) Bite them as hard as possible, gouge out their eyes with your thumbs. make them bleed and hurt them as much as possible. If you're shoved into the trunk of the car kick out the tail light,  you can get your head out or wave to drivers behind you. Most modern cars have some kind of button or switch to open the trunk from the inside, use this if you can, if it's an older vehicle you should just do the tail light thing.   part 3: secondary location  if you're taken to the secondary location you're basically dead, but don't give up. If your kidnapper threatens to kill you if you try to escape don't listen to them, if you let the kidnapper have their way you'll wish you WERE dead. if a violent enough rape is occurring and you can't fight back you can play possum, it may work. just hope they dump you on the side of the road, if they try to dismember you under the assumption that you've died then surprise attack them. Take note of alllllll of your surroundings, everything you see and hear you have to remember. Report ALL of it.
"Arrivederci, losers" -Vriska probably
THEY HAVEF FREAKING KIDNAPPING HACKS NOW
“are you getting strangled?” idk lemme check
This video feels like prime Danny😁
this was so stupidly funny
the duct tape works if you use a bunch of force tense and swing out to your sides fast
Ahhh he’s back
Not me getting a velcro ad💀
The sims music in the background???
honestly who expected none of these to work
why do the socks have toe holds 😟
this is literally my favorite video on the internet, i laughed SO HARD
Diassapointed he didn't end the video with 'arrivederci losers!'
Why is there sims 3 create a sim music at the start
I would let Danny kidnap me😩
Yo that was manbeasts "rabrabrahbrah"
pls “arrivederci” is goodbye in italian 💀💀
I had a tough couple of days and this video made me laugh out loud through the whole thing thank you for this y’all
Obviously with the way these videos are troom troom doesn’t even take themselves seriously I’m pretty sure they do it all as jokes and it’s mad funny lol.
the way he said arrivederci made me piss my pants
Nick: (Notices the scarf) What’s that?  Danny: This is a…I always wear this.
I thought this video was about hacks to kidnap someone
13:00 (ignore)
8:25 🤦‍♀️ just 🤦‍♀️ they could have at least given an actual helpful life saving tip that boots on cars actual have a emergency manual latch that was designed for in case people/kids lock themselves in their trunk and usually this latch also glows in the dark too.
the background is so white
Woah, that surprised  me, 15:51 is ny desktop picture
the 1k dislikes are kidnappers and the narrator
The scotch tape and match ones can be kinda useful ig. Imagine that, troom-troom being useful
“Matches smell like shit” while BURNING PLASTIC
why is the narrator just mickey mouse
6:49 can we just talk about that mortal kombat drawing for a second? xD
Ah, yes. The plastic zip tie handcuffs that all kidnappers use.
For me, the worst thing about Troom Troom videos are not the terrible ideas... But the god-awful narration makes me feel violent.
3:32 wtf kind of sock is that
Love the sims 3 music in the background
"Gimme your... get- get- get in the car 😠"
9:07 anyone else notice the dummy lying on the ground?
The narrator's voice genuinely makes me wanna cry
11:19 this sure isn’t flex tape
Thumbnail 10/10
DANNY YOU HAVE TO REVIEW RYAN PRUNTY IT WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD VIDEO PLEASE!!!!!
Is it just me, or has the narrator's voice gotten more annoying and voice-cracky?
Yeah, the match thing will only work with a specific type of match that isn't very common. See, matches require two substances + friction to light. For safety, only ONE of the substances is put on the actual match - the other is on the scraping surface on the matchbox. This is much safer as matches can't accidentally light in the box, so it's very rare to see ones you can strike on, say, a dungeon wall (at least afaik, i havent exactly looked for them but every match i've seen has been the safer kind)
13:36 that's what she said 😏
Get outta the car Get unlost 2.0
Troom Troom: Arivvederci! *Ah yes!*Italian mother noises* *
The crafting corner bit gave me Jenna marbles energy and I loved it
i've only been going to self-defense class for couple of months, but even then there are so many red flags with Troom Troom "hacks", thankfully no one is taking these seriously.
rawr
I love the sims music in the background
Troom needs to be stoped xD i was dying when the girl called the guns "Crimanals"
13:35 thats what she said
Danny coughs like a cute little ol baaaaaaby
the sims cas music as background music!?! i thought i had my sims open for a sec :|
THE TOE SOCKS ?!!!!
5:47...ha u said da insted of the :)
Step One: Use a tiny part of your strength to break the zip ties
Cut the tip off 😂
Female actor: *breaks tape easily*  Danny:..HOW ?!? HUH-😨 *then does mathematical equation to see how it works*
this has to be satire
this video made my belly hurt from laughing
13:16 you look like batman XD
troom troom is not serious ? wow dude thanks you blew my mind.
Troom Troom has Stockholm syndrome
Seeing Nick was a pleasant surprise 😇😇😎😎
"Like a hooved creature" and he references the one hooved animal that l can think of off the top of my head that has only toe
At 17:34 Danny really said 🦟🦟🦟
3:09 is that a glove you're wearing?
These aren't pranks. These are crimes.
Nick looks like a Mexican Wilbur soot 15:59
Chandler energy
always remeber, We all got born as a gun
You’re telling me I’m legally not allowed to chase and kidnap someone??
The previous narrator was awful but I miss her
God he has COVID
16:21 LMFAO at Nick
do more videos with nick, he makes me giggle
good video danny
Duct tape actually rips super easy on a cross tear. Like ripping a piece off to use. Scotch tape is stronger than duct tape as far as ripping it goes
A random garage with an Alexa and some rogue crutches    Seems perfectly normal 🤷‍♀️
I've always wanted to know kidnap people
Has a ps5 but no tv huh? Lol
I thought the title meant Danny would be trying Troom Troom hacks for kidnapping people, not the other way around
troom troom sucks
3:08 WTF ARE THOSE SOCKS BRO
The narrator sounds different like her voice is high-pitched
arrivederci means goodbye in italian 😇
go to 4:41 and look in the corner of the screen
Dude he got #1 on trending
Don’t forget to cut of the tip
alsO THE NEW NARRATOR IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING GTJKRDBJ
The thumbnail thoo 😭😭
Hahahahahahaha the scarf
What happened to troom troom voice over that is so bad oh my God
You both work so well together.
I saw kidnapping hacks and I thought ... so that's why I'm watching this
OB MY GOD
love the sims 3 music in the background - really adds to the whole video
One of the greatest videos of yours I really love it and appreciate all the effort that went on it  Thanks a lot, awesome video!!
So these kidnappers have to kidnap someone to ransom a TV, but they managed to get a PS5? Everything else in their video's is 100% accurate and true, but that is just bullshit!
wait, do you really say arrivederci in America?
This is the funniest vid of danny's in a long time. Both the crafting section and the kidnapping section were great, but they were even better in the same video.
I felt like I was choking you for a while  Yeah you were
i miss "This Video Is Over Now"
What happened to ur outro song 😭😭
Omg it’s the end of the world there might be a Trom Trom hack that worked holy shiz
This is genuinely the funniest video of Danny's I've ever watched I was in tears from the moment he cut out his eye holes right up to the end
All jokes aside troom troom doing this is so tone deaf considering the serious trauma and issues many kidnap survivors deal with
But I want toes.... :(
8:37..  Did anyone else notice the ‘bandit’ sniff the chain-?
If this was a real scenario and she was being kidnapped, she could of punched the crims then grab the pistols and shoot. [provided A: she knows how to fire one. B: the guns are loaded and ready to fire {VERY RARE} and she has good aim and knows how to pull the trigger. {please don't take this as a realistic thing i'm just pointing out the obvious]
i’m kinda disappointed i didn’t see you try and bust out of scotch tape tbh. i feel like that would have been harder
Danny defo smokes
Is it me or do I hear Sims 3 soundtrack as background music sometimes? haha SUL SUL
"Caaaaarrrrrl, that kills people!"
im glad nick is getting so much attention he's so funny
The astounding amount of kidnap-themed videos by Troom-Troom is incredibly suspicious, one or more of the writers behind the channel must have some sort of fetish for that.
WHAT ARE THAT GIRL’S FEET??!?
0:20 not the sims 3 soundtack💀
have your friend in more videos like this. I like the change of pace
Lol y’all are hella funny together 😂😂
The fact Nick’s acts like danny’s dad is hilarious!😂
I'm a Ukrainian and scotch tape is duct tape
I canti stand her voice
the part where Nick just opened the back killed me
I inhaled one lmfao
Shiiii congrats Dan Dan👌 deees is 31 on trending
When Danny winked I felt it man. I felt it.
His reasoning for not being bear foot is pure intellectual genius.
fun fact: horses will actually do hack #2 when they're being saddled up. So you gotta wait for them to relax and tighten the part that goes around the belly again lol
You ever got Stockholm syndrome so bad you buy a flatscreen?
I lost it at the Alexa part lmao
Why did it seem like nick is actually the one who was kidnapped?
Im sorry did playstation sponsor troom troom kidnapping edition?
The 8:30 ]!rt is actually real I read it In a survival book
nick with the glasses over the ski mask lol 😂
When I say that this is one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen from Danny, I’m not kidding. I was shaking laughing and pissing the whole time
"If you have some matches, you can play so many games!" These videos are for kids right?
My favorite part of the video, 15:51 the Danny’s sinister lair.
That sims 3 music in the background tho 🥵🥵
Danny’s obv never heard of tabis
Ahh yes you kidnapped me so here have a TV
I am now truly greg
I don’t know why but I think Danny looks kinda like Ben from never have I ever
thought these were gonna be hacks on how to kidnap someone-
Boutta try these out on my siblings. Wish me luck.
Danny, did you do the most important step and buy Nick a TV or PlayStation?
nick out here lookin like a rejected fantastic mr. fox character
Moooom, can you get me Venom? No sweetie, we have Venom at home. The Venom at home: 13:31
So if : Criminal = Gun.  Meaning : Parents were criminals = Parents were guns ..... Those goddam sons of a gun!
I feel like you don’t realize that Troom Troom is supposed to be surrealist satire. It’s absurd and terrible because it’s trying to be. It’s like a bad Ukrainian Tim and Eric.
That one about breathing in when you're being tied gave me so much nostalgia. Because a character from a Brazilian kid's movie I saw when I was little did that. I remember it well because I wanted to test it out so I asked my brother to tie me to a pillar (he didn't even question it) and then I did the thing and fortunately it worked.
Fun fact matches used to be able to light like that but they changed the ingredients bc ppl kept being set on fire
can't focus on the video with this the sims 3 music in the background
why does he pull a face when he is tensing his muscles
Hi
"If you're kidnapped in a car, just get out of the car"  has the same vibes as "if you're homeless, just buy a house"...
love the sims 3 music
Is this a jojo reference??
Did they get a new narrator or something? Her voice is awful for the sheer fact of poorly imitating the original narrator
I mean if the dungeon looked like that, i sure as hell wouldnt have complaints considering how most dungeons are, this one seems like its first class.
5:35 when you become political
As a JoJo fan, it took me forever to understand that she's saying Arrivederci.
nick look exactly like a mix of wilbur soot and jarvis johnson
Id like to rate the kidnapper 4/10
Why did the dude sniff the chain? Like... Is that how you test it to make sure it's real? Like when you bite gold... Is that why he sniffed the chain?
she go dragged to the shadow realm
I WAS EATING WATCHING THIS I STARTED CHOKING IN MY FOOD WHEN THEY SNAPPED THE GUYS NECK 😭😭😭
Ah, yes, I love arts and crimes.
Narrator's voice is annoying asf. It's like if Dora made it a mission to say the dumbest things in the most sarcastic way possible
My lawyer informed me to not confirm what *_snapping someone's neck_* does to them
btw “arrivederci” does mean “goodbye/bye” but it implies that you're probably going to meet again with the person you're talking to. “addio” would be better to use since it's kind of a “goodbye forever” and it implies you're probably never going to meet again with the other person
nick: “i felt like i was choking you tho, for a while there..” danny: “yeah, you WERE”
i love how the narrator is saying "I got kidnapped oh no" in a very friendly and happy voice
So we have to ask them if they watch troom troom before kidnapping them, got it
Nick and danny  are just hilarious
Danny, were you high at the crafting table?
Yo just wait and let the tiktok mom to come save you.
This video taught me to say “good job Martin!” If kidnapped. Got it.
Wasn’t expecting the viagra ad before this video
we all know that when you escape from a kidnapper you have to say "bye" to them in italian, it makes you cool
The cover picture made me die 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Neck/chin thing would hurt like a bitch but wouldn't kill you since you wouldn't be likely to actually break their neck Edit: also I dont believe the matches would work on nothing but the wall since the fire is caused by a chemicsl reaction with the strike strip
just found out i have school photos tomorrow this is the only thing that can console me rn
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is the music in the beginning of the video the sims 3 theme? catchiest shit ever
The general rule for kidnappings is fight, always fight, do everything you can to not get into the vehicle or whatever they're taking you in. Even if you take a beating you need to make it not worth their while to take you. If it's an armed robbery though, it's the opposite, give em your stuff and always comply
There's just a doll of a naked women on the floor lol
bruh, i saw the title and wtf
13:53 you realise, Danny, you've made yourself desirable Numero Uno for Wiki feet members when you said this, they're coming for you now and theres nothing you or we commenters can do to help stop them
Don’t do it if you’re in a choke protect your neck first
Danny reminder do u still have the Christmas hat from the i wana kill santa Claus music video
Why does the narrator sound like a prepubescent mickey mouse 💀
The tape one works
That arrivederci did not sound right.
Arriverderci means goodbye in Italian bruh 😭
Are you getting strangled 😃
Ow my braincells
“Actual kidnapped person tries troom troom’s awful kidnapping hacks”
Nickisnotacriminal????
That square joke is knot funny  aha
It’s hella weird hearing the narrator say fucked it shit in that voice..
Bruh,  nice cut! Bro that’s like literally the best I’ve ever seen your hair.
Broke Pls Send Money to: Mark Edwards, Flat 7, Preston Court, Sanford Lane, Wareham, Dorset, BH20 4DX, UK. Please Share address everywhere 🙏🏻👍🏻
they kidnapped polis, they were ruthless ruthless never killers killers wouldnt even bother, the government tries to hire the mafia to track them but then they left he mafia a message beyond buisness they know this was a war money cant afford so nah they failed to
weather man stormed fbi and destroyed cointelpro files, bombed the capitol all rich white kids to not one gangsta or black panthers even dared to challenge the wetherman hackers and they wernt gangstas or warriors do youse know why? something unbelievable to devilles of cruellas 100 dalmations, do you know why the fbi cia and all the federal powers couldnt stop them? a veil over the system in a nutshell the devilles tried every dirty trick in cia playbook in the homeland, they couldnt realise it was their own kids
this is hakers hackers, full haxers of hakers in the 60s woodstocks hackers, weathermen no computer hackers.. oh wait no! they aint 😭 there haxxers 2021, weather men were my hackers examples thats how i put it on anons took iver there whole thing and gave it back tbh, people should look into thier own hoo haa
god, the narrator's voice is giving me such a fucking headache
this was the first time i genuinely laughed in awhile
1000th dislike
I failed my test.
I disliked the vid just because the number of dislikes is 999 & I wanted to make it 1k , good vid tho
Danny: Straighten yourself  Me: But I’m gay.
Actually what you do in the car setting where you are being held down by your neck in the drivers seat just pull the seat all the way back and if you can crash the car of get out
Danny seems depressed
Anyone else assume the tips were gonna be on how to kidnap someone?
Ariba juachi means Why until we made again
'if you have a box of matches, you can think of so many games' yeah. right.
i CaN't TeLl HoW CoMmOn ThIs Is.... THEN WHY TF AM I STILL IN YOUR BASEMENT DANNY
"Are you getting strangled?" I DIED 😭😭
Nick was legit my favorite part of this video.
There’s a lot of homoeroticism in this video
why does white male have black frined?!?!
5:04 how liberals view criminals
Is this the actual funniest video I’ve ever watched, or is it just two in the morning?
how does a person even get into your car? why is the car unlocked for them to get in?
Why…. did he rent out a garage and not just do this in his creepy murder basement ???
This video was great and very informative! I’ll definitely be using the last hack the next time I’m kidnapped 😊
Plot twist :the person who makes the ideas for troom troom is actually traumatized from their past and they reenact scenarios in which they wish they could have escaped
3:34 is a clear HAND in the toe-socks lol
"Are you being strangeld?" Damn troom troom don't kink shame me.
Oh ok yeah. We won’t be addressing the dude sniffing the chain I see
I love the sims music <33
All of this happened to me, I can approve these escapes are legit and possible
Okay but doesn't Arriverderci mean "until we meet again"... So... I feel like this is the plot twist of the century where she was surprisingly the kidnapper and forcing the others to do all of this illegal activity, but they weren't allowed to leave until they fulfill every possible kidnapping scenario known to mankind   (... Also, alongside the duct tape technique, zipties are also the same! It's often taught in actual self defense classes! You might damage your wrists slightly, but it's useful to get free!)
I just tried the duct tape thing with my boyfriend and I got through 7 layers before I wanted to quit. THIS MAN'S WENT THROUGH 13 LAYERS LIKE WHAT we both felt like gods
WHAT. I’m so impressed that last one worked.
wait. danny knows the normal amount of ductape to use in a kidnapping.
I almost shit myself laughing. Help
Danny: Are you guys getting some useful tips out of this? Me:I think so 😂
The voice is cringe as fuck hahaha The troom troom video should be called "how to survive being kidnapped by troom troom"
9:09 what is kidnapper doing with that statue?
I've never cried so much laughing at a video
I missed Danny bruv I haven’t watched him in forever, he makes me laugh so much nxdnkdksdkkd
“There’s our victim! 😍🤩💫💞” Jesus Christ this video is fucking terrifying
i’m surprised no one has brought up the socks.  the toe socks
the fun energy between nick and danny makes the video even better
She's got Stockholm Syndrome, obviously.
nick: “i felt like i was choking you tho, for a while there..” danny: “yeah, you WERE”
Why is the narrator in the first video Missy from Big Mouth 😂😂😂
Are u boycotting Amazon?
I'm glad that I know how to survive if I'm kidnapped now.
Billy _iLEAVES_ I'll see myself out
Matches use phosphorous to ignite, but in the case of modern matches, it's on the outside of the box rather than on the tip of the match itself. They're 'safety' matches specifically because they can't be lit like you're trying to do in this video.
are we not gonna talk about how most kidnappers will tape your wrists... BEHIND your back?
You know troom troom is bullshit when a single hack happens to work and gets everyone elated, calling for a celebration
Are you the part of lgbt?
Was I the only one who began to freak out when the kidnappers through the girl on a bed...
1:22 The high pitched, friendly squeak of "There's our victim," is truely terrifying.
I love Nick not being clued into anything until the very moment he needs to perform.
we need to talk about the number plate for the car
“Are you tied up with scotch tape?” “No.” “Perfect! Raise your hand!”
3:09 the socks??!
kidnapped? just leave!
I could totally of used that neck one I was held hostage and if that worked that would of been aweosme
12:27 me when I’m in a Walmart
15:32 danny: "is this how people wear scarfs? ok yeah it is" shawls: *"am i a joke to yo-"*
Is it just me or is the troom troom narrator doing high levels of helium and crack cocaine
Toby McGuire Spider-Man , is that you?
4:39 me when i won the test of stupidity
8:07 ???
I liked the old narrator
3:09 WTFFF ARE THOSEEEE
23:13 hahah the Jim reference 😂
Just found this emoji and thought it was appropriate for this…    🪤
Where did all the skinny girls go
When i saw the bed.. OH NO DONT DO IT
9:07 why is there a naked mannequin in the background?
Danny's eyes are genuinely terrifying, they're staring into my soul
this is just  half an hour of danny roasting troom troom
9:13 arrivaderchi??
fun fact, the duct taped wrist escape actually works with zip ties too, if a singular zip tie is around your wrists in the same position. one of the very, VERY few actually legitimate hacks this channel has ever offered.
The only reason I know about the “holding your breath” thing is because horses sometimes hold their breath when the girth of the saddle is tightened; you always have to double check the girth before swinging into the saddle. Or else you’ll fall off. :)
Is there nobody seeing in the first life hack that she didn’t need to even get the hand cuffs off. All she needed to do was wait till he was gone, get up, open the bar door and leave.
Watching Danny struggle with the beenie because he didn't take the time to measure out the hole is the funniest thing I've seen all day
I'm crying at them trying to light a safety match on a wall and their shock at duct tape tearing (which is literally designed to be easy to tear)
I CANT EVEN WATCH THE VIDEO. HER VOICE. OH MY GOD. NOTHINGS EVER MADE ME WANNA JUST..PUNCH A RANDO SO BAD
The FitnessGramPacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
The necessary thing from being choked from behind almost works. At least with my experience in self-defence, I'd say tuck your chin like she does, place your hands in the same spots on their head as she does. But instead of doing a "necksnap" try to swing them around you, bend their head to make it easier. Then either run away while their getting up or start curb stomping them, Hey they decided to fight you!
My husband and I love to watch your videos and then we dance to your outro because it’s a banger BUT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PUTTING IT IN SO WE HAVE TO GO FIND IT IN A DIFFERENT VIDEO AND FASTFORWARD TO THE END   PLEASE INCLUDE THE OUTRO AND SAVE MY MARRIAGE thanks
Can Danny and David504 do a parody
I'm genuinely impressed that they somehow managed to find a more annoying voice actress than that last one
7:26 that shit is probably a thing mr beast will do hahahaha
Are you getting strangled??? .....Yeah....
This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. I was geeking LMAO
Well just grab the keys from the guard to untie yourself
danny is way too excited about getting pretend kidnapped
of COURSE TroomTroom are criminals! That's how they get their actors!
Pierre Laporte would never
Did they use safety matches or strike anywhere
Nick is so effortlessly funny i need these two to collab more
Danny you just made an inside joke. Congratulations. CRiMiNaLs  EvERyWHEre  I'm Dying rn XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
billie eilish, more like billy eyelash
You guys are so funny together this video was your funniest one in awhile LOVED IT!
16:29 there's criminals _everywhere!_  😟                  'Criminal': ᵂʰᵃᵗ ᵃʳᵉ ʷᵉ ᵈᵒᶦⁿᵍ ʰᵉʳᵉ
I don’t like the nick guy
24:24 was THE funniest thing to me, I laughed for a solid 2 minutes ☠️
wow these people on troom troom are geniuses  especially the really girly narrator that sounds like Dora the Explorer who says: Gotcha Girly!  wow, geniuses
Oh man oh boy these are so relatable and I'm sure they are helpful
The trick at 8:44 is actually something horses will do to try and keep their saddles loose because there bitches
27:24 When your kidnapper gives you the best motivational speech to help you escape *Really relatable bro*
pog
.-.
this has to be funniest thing i’ve seen in a while, thanks loser
i think troom troom is reading too much Watpad
Imagine getting strangled, but closing the car door after escaping-
*Man, I love it when he wears that scarf*
3:05 ARE WE JUST GOING TO IGNORE HER SOCKS LMFAOOO
I don't know what's worse in those videos. The stupid-ass lifehacks, the dumb narration/dialogue thing or the overall silliness of the acting.
Imagine being Danny’s friend😩 @nick
Stooop I just shattered my phone today :(
the sims music at the top of the vid is really fucking me up
As someone taking a self defense class, do NOT try to break their neck. It's better to elbow, back kick, or stomp their feet
Nice room rearrangement, much better than your original config
Anyone else feel that weird tension between them
Troom Troom aren’t kidnappers but they did all grow up in what used to be the Soviet Block so they probably did know people who were victims of kidnapping and organized criminal extortion.
Please don't melt plastic 😔😔😔
8:20 saving my spot
If you  get kidnapped  in a car then get out of the car
Slight problem. What if they tie my hands behind my back
the narrator sound like she’s trying to talk like Snow White
You need to watch "Say no to crack! Say yes to rollerskating!"
nickisnotgreen deserves the clout!!!
10:16 me with my tesla: *slowly reclines*
Boyfriends 🥺
Great job, Danny, now your weird toe socks are gonna end up on the foot wiki
The mask with the hole in the back killed me 😭🖐🏻
"He had a gunmetal grey face"  No guns life fans: *oh no*
The sims 3 music in the beginning of the video really ties this all together.
The people probably thinks your running a kinky bdsm dungeon
If I had to watch one video on how to escape a kidnapping I would watch this video
9:15 ariverDERTCHI losers!
So how about all those refrigerator trucks for all the bodies in the warzone hospitals so overwhelmed they had time to make tiktok dance videos while medical Navy ships sat empty?
If what they were saying until.we see each other again does that mean you know them? Again troops troops doesn't know what kidnapping is.🙃
video title idea:troom troom is troom troom's trooooooooom.
20:16
greg
Your hair is graying
you didnt even give the kidnapper a thank you gift...SMH...
Or a knife
Wait what if they have a gun
is kevin call me kevin because uh the resemblance is kinda scary 2:49
10:11
This is one of my favorites
So the choke hold thing: i grapple and as far as i know you will not have enough strength or force to snap someones neck as well as to mention you wont have time :)
Today on Troom Troom. How to get yourself killed in a kidnapping situation.
Getting kidnapped Just Say No
I hate when I’m kidnapped! At least troom troom is helping.
*Inspirational troom troom quotes :*  *Oh no I'm being kidnapped!*  *Gotcha girly!* *Is your spoon not working?*  *Just use instant noodles!!* *No you want to get your rubber ducky and tape it onto your earrings.*  *Is somebody stalking your boyfriend?*  *Does your kid not stop peeing in the pool?*  *Vote Troom Troom 2024*
I’d just like to say thank you for changing my life with being so funny, your videos are great for watching after school
Two masked men... throwing a girl onto a bed...  I've seen this before
As someone who regularly has the issue of being kidnapped, this helped a lot!
Why does the narrator sound like minnie mouse
Are we not gonna talk about the socks dawg those were atrocious
Lmao you didn't use the right type of matches
As I was watching this yesterday during the middle of the video I got an amber alert
Everybody- Omg this guy is such a nut Me- M I L K P O S T E R
I totally snorted my cascade ice through my nose when Danny held up the bb gun and was like "criminals"
At 8:09 it’s like one of those crazy acid videos lol
Lol danny actually trigged my Alexa
how did you watch that first video good lord her voice.. holy balls.
IM CACKLING
What if someones life actually gets saved from that duct tape hack
Funniest. Man. Ever.
12:57 why he lookin like rocko from boondock saints
Danny may hate this but he and Troom Troom are forever linked. They just go together so beautifully. If they ever met they would look at each other‘s eyes and say “you really GET me.” I’ve seen many reaction channels to Troom Troom and it’s just like polyester instead of silk
danny in that scarf looks like a middle aged woman coming back from a coffee and brunch
Why does Danny look like he's sitting in a dentist's chair?
9:09 why is there a mannequin on the ground?
This is the best video he's ever posted.
I can just tell already that this is gonna be one of the Danny videos I come back to after a hard day and just laugh my knees off to
Step 1: Escape using matches and fire Step 2: Develop Stockholm syndrome
A better idea- try breaking it over your knee instead of just moving your hands. Raise your hands over your head, and bring your elbows down past either side of your knee in one sharp moment. Also-  try not to get kidnapped.
chiropractors snap necks I don't think that is one would kill anyone
Idk why this video made me feel kinda high
"you have nice skin for a youtuber" i am not a youtube so that means I should have nice skin by this logic. why do I not have beautiful skin. smh
*“I’m being kidnapped”*
This whole situation they have made up is so bad. If they had really been kidnapped they would have been thrown in a room probably with the lights off and proper handcuffs, fed if they are lucky, maybe given something to drink, shouted at and if the captor found them attractive potentially raped and if they wanted a ransom there would have been videos and pictures taken of her and if the family dont pay then probably beaten or tortured and another video taken until the family pay or she is dead or sold to sex traffickers. So not really something to joke about and make up BS hacks to save your life.
4:42 not the worst thing by any means to happen to somebody when they're thrown on a bed by kidnappers
ok it DOES NOT matter if the door is unlocked because YOU ARE INSIDE THE CAR AND THEN DOOR BEING LOCKED PREVENTS PPL GOING IN UR CAR U CAN GET OUT ANY TIME IF U ARE INSIDE THE CAR!!!sorry for yelling im a weirdo
this is what tyler meant by a boy is a gun
why is nick on every video with everyone
I've been tied to a tree with a chain You aint getting outs  It was a drunk joke Thank God I was sitting down though it was a 40 pound chain
Is it just me or did anyone else notice how the dislikes on here show "911"  Btw if it doesn't then thats because the time when i commented this was different
Dude can't u just this once be serious with your reviews u know LESS silly & more reviewing as u spent most of this post just talking shite man like way more than usual... Sure it can be good for a laugh but lately it feels like u are just phoning it in & hardly even trying...
That's is, my next car is gonna be a 2-door
The duck tape has fibers to rip it lol.
when the guy filming laughed at 27:10  i died
I thought his friends was Benoftheweek lol
"Guns don't kill people, criminals kill people, and criminals are guns" needs to be merch
Thinking standing up is a good idea, then realizing they usually tie your legs to the chair too.
does the narrators voice physically hurt anyone else?
Maybe the real kidnappers are the friends we made along the way.
At 10:11 I was taking a sip of my drink and laughed at your joke then starting choking and laughing at the same time. I’m good now btw.
Wow
Teet
If your on pc then spam 5 while watching
I tried these "hacks", and now the only thing left of me is a finger my ghost is using to type out this comment.
9:15 Trish after defeating Notorious B.I.G be like.
fun fact they called it scotch tape because in russian duct tape is scotch
10:55 The ultimate plan
this is the funniest thing i’ve ever seen
Stockholm Syndrome Tutorial
Pov: Danny Gonzales is getting kidnapped
I can just imagine Danny going to the store and asking for toe socks
This is such a funny danni gorganzola video, good work 👍
I love your content! Be safe everyone! 🙏🏽🙏🏽
My AP English teacher sounds a scary amount like the Troom Troom narrator
The narrator sounds like a puppet in an Adult Swim skit
The tv joke made me laugh ngl
I have a theory that troom troom is 1 american guy in a basement, with a team he paid off of fiverr that he translated himself with either an AI girl voice or someone else too.
Danny please make a toenly fans please we beg of you
why did I think Nick was 5'4?
Can you do My story animated ext?
Why did I think it was life hacks for kidnapping people.
Please stop your killing me I can’t stop laughing
"I guess I know what I'm doing" The kidnapper overcoming impostor syndrome is beautiful. Good for him!
Huh-hoh    Huh-hoh
Danny: *calls a gun a criminal* Nick: You uh, you okay bro
Fairly sure it takes like a very large amount of force to snap someones neck, like not something a normal human could do, i would google it but i would probably be raided by the fbi.
The people watching Danny get choked 💀
I'm gonna assume someone mentioned Stockholm Syndrome, regarding the girl giving her TV away... I can't be bothered to scroll.
Arebaderchi losers
The clip of her putting the chair back to crush him is so funny
Amongous
Troom Troom Videos Are Painful 😖😣
Lmao this was a great video😂
Troom Troom Is Criminal
The narrator voice makes me wanna die
I Hate Troom Troom
Imagine being that one guy who thought you were setting off fireworks. Then imagine living close to that garage and seeing these random dudes do this. Mind blown.
this video was so unentertaining it took me 3 sittings to finish it
The duct tape hack is actually relatively commonly known to most women/girls these days. It’s come in handy for many women! I remember seeing something about it on a daytime show like Oprah or Dr. Phil.
Okay but Danny winking at the camera 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Reality in Chenzhou There is a saying in modern China, “In the old days, bandits were deep in the mountain; nowadays, they are in police uniforms.” Police are supposed to serve the people, but they have become the CCP's weapons to attack innocent people in its persecution of Falun Gong. In Chenzhou City, which Xi visited, many Falun Gong practitioners have been targeted for their faith. Below are a few examples.  Mafia-Style Robbery  Mr. Li Muduo, former employee of the Suxian Industrial and Commercial Bank, had poor health since childhood. After he began to practice Falun Gong, not only did he recover from his numerous illnesses but he also became a better citizen following the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. During a major flood in 1998, he donated 3,000 yuan and was praised by officials. When wildfires broke out in a nearby mountain, he volunteered to rescue stranded people.  After the persecution of Falun Gong began in July 1999, however, Mr. Li was detained for three months in 2000, and his home was ransacked twice. The police seized his cash and bank deposit book and took pictures of him and his wife. With forged IDs, the police then took money from the couple's bank accounts.  When Mr. Li went to Beijing again in 2001 to appeal for justice for Falun Gong, officials took him to a labor camp for a one-year term. His employer later fired him, leaving his family in poverty.  Ms. Fan Liying, a kindergarten teacher in the Beihu District, learned to be a better person by following the Falun Gong teachings and treated children with kindness. Because of her belief, she was detained ten times and demoted from her position. The former teacher became a babysitter and later a cleaner. Between pay cuts and police-imposed fines, she lost 110,000 yuan (or $16,000) in total.  Wife Imprisoned for Seeking Justice for Husband’s Death  Ms. Li Jumei, a 63-year-old elementary school teacher in Jiahe Country of Chenzhou, used to suffer from bone cancer. With no money for medical treatment, she attempted suicide multiple times due to the pain: she threw herself onto a railroad track, jumped into a river, and swallowed a large number of sleeping pills. Fortunately, she was rescued all three times.  Three months after beginning to practice Falun Gong, Ms. Li became totally healthy. Health professionals were amazed and asked her for a copy of Zhuan Falun, the main book of Falun Gong. Ms. Li’s husband, Mr. Guo Huisheng, who worked at the Jiahe Legal Office, became interested and also took up Falun Gong. The practice, too, made him a better and more conscientious worker.  After the persecution started in 1999, Mr. Guo was arrested and taken to a labor camp. Ms. Li was also detained six times and taken to a labor camp twice. The economic losses the couple suffered added up to over 100,000 yuan. While in detention, Ms. Li suffered from over 10 types of physical and mental torture. In addition, she was taken to a brainwashing center in March 2000, followed by another detention in August 2000 with more fines.  After Mr. Guo urged Xi Xiaogang, Lanshan County police chief, not to persecute Falun Gong, he was beaten in July 2009 by a team of officers led by political instructor Hu Yonghui. As a result, Mr. Guo had blood all over and lost consciousness. Without Mr. Guo or Ms. Li at home, officials ransacked their home twice, taking many bags of their personal belongings.  On October 12, 2009, Mr. Guo died at 52, leaving two daughters and elderly parents, already in their 80s, unattended.  In June 2015, Ms. Li submitted a criminal complaint to China’s Supreme Court suing former CCP leader Jiang Zemin for launching the persecution resulted in her husband’s death. In October 2015, she was arrested and later sentenced to 7 years in prison.  Violation of Legal Procedures  Mr. Lei Anxiang, a practitioner in his 70s, was on trial at Beihu Court on October 31, 2019. There were no lawyers defending him, and he was not allowed to defend himself.  The secret trial occurred in a small room in No. 198 Military Hospital. After his wife and daughter answered some basic questions, the prosecutor included Falun Gong informational materials confiscated from his home as evidence against him. Although there was no legal basis to sentence him, the prosecutor recommended two years of prison.  Judge Luo Hongrong sentenced Mr. Lei to three years and fined him 5,000 yuan on November 12, 2019. Mr. Lei appealed, only to be rejected.  Almost Cremated Alive  Mr. Lei Jingxiong, a 24-year-old practitioner from Jiahe County, was arrested on August 18, 2004. Police officers beat him badly at 4 p.m. By that evening, he had lost consciousness. The police then took him to a crematorium.  Right before Mr. Lei was to be cremated, a female guard found him moving a bit.  “He’s still alive, and we cannot burn him,” suggested the guard.  “He’s already like this, plus we’re already here. Why not?” several officers insisted.  But the guard did not budge, and Mr. Lei survived.
Cencenyera🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey Danny I like your Costa Rica tree frog shirt 😂
Love the thumbnail Danny
Nick is like that kidnapper helping the person escape so funny and it’s funny that the person but they were doing something illegal
So like Nick just strangled Danny
Danny Gonzalez, Queen if our Hearts
4:40 24:12
Arrive derci means "until we meet again" tho so why would they want to see their captors AGAIN.
Danny G SKINCARE ROUTINE?!?!
The narrator's voice makes we wish I was deaf 🙃
26:02.  Is it just me or does that not look like duck tape in the vedio?
“Gimme your….self” I’m dead
Nice
“Im definitely not gonna show my feet for *free* for you sickos”  **Pulls out wallet**
Troomtroom: kill the kidnappers and act like you don’t
.
Imagine your agent calls you saying they booked you an acting job and it’s for a fucking troom troom video
The tape one usually works when you do it on your knee
Gotcha girly
This is some of your best work
9:09 so we’re just gonna ignore the dummy in the background….
why is no one talking about how the narrator sounds like mickey mouse
Nahh you guys just like to be tide up ^>^
That was a very good transition into the commercial I hope they paid you good like honestly I don’t mean that as a rude gesture
This really makes kidnapping just a normal and a fine thing which is super insensitive to everyone who has ever been kidnapped.
Girls: I wonder why we live so much longer than guys Guys: 24:46
3:09 why does she have a painted on sock?
24:24 enemies to lovers arc
Troom Troom has Stockholm Syndrome  😵
I enjoy this style of video so much
It doesnt matter how bad my day is . Danny always has me 😂😂😂😂😂
This is like a really dumb mythbusters video lmaoo
Am I the only one who saw then creepy mannequin on the floor  9:08
Yes Danny snapping neckes kill people how many times do I have to tell you
yes it does theres a 000000000000000000000,1%change you will live
skylars got some stockholm sydrome she needs to sort out
That wink tho
Danny for the love of god please cut out a section for the nose
Your background music in the beginning is from The Sims 3, idk if it's also the music of the pc version, but definitely in the on for Wii
Not the "arrivederci" please, take my money and leave but please stop it😭
Danny this is literally one of the funniest videos you’ve ever made good job dude
I read crafting corner as catfishing corner 😂
Thank you for putting your body through all that pain and torture for me to learn what to do when or if someone kidnaps me. I'm ready to take on the world.  O look there's someone sketchy now, let's see if I can get kidn
9:09 the mannequin in the back??
her socks scare me so much
I laughed waaaaaaayy too hard when they were trying the scarf thing 🤣🤣🤣
It’s like manipulating cops to buy time in movies, you tell some truths and then some bullshit
Never thought I'd say this but i miss the old troom troom voice over person, this new one is just painful on the ears
i started watching this and fell asleep.. i am so sorry
what would bambi think of this nick…
This is the funniest video lol
13:36 that’s what she said
3:12 thats what she said
How is he like 27 but looking like an 15 year old boy 😩
Man I'd love to hang out with you 2
"that's the kind of knot you'd tie, you fucking square" "jesus"
Troom Troom aren't kidnappers. The kidnappers are forcing them to make pro-kidnapper videos.
HOLY SHIT THE GIRL PUTTING HER SEAT BACK I LOVE HER FACE ITS JUST 😐
Why is the background music the CAS music in the sims 3?💀
What the fuck is up with the narrator
why is the biggest thing that i noticed in this video is that he used sims 3 music
Where did you get that dope ass crewneck?
The way Danny looked at nick when he was tryna light the match was just 🤌🏻
Just a reminder that Danny said “I’m not showing you sickos my feet… FOR FREE”
10:05 ah yes, I always have a thumb tack on my neck
Gimme your g g get in the car
The narration is fucking obnoxious
10:10
19:22 wait I thought that was kurtis for a second
9:29
The DIY ski mask looks like a budget Space Ghost costume 😆
I got an ad for velcro right before the scarf diy
Fun fact, you can use shoelaces to file through zip ties. Run the laces through the zip ties then tie them together. Peddle/saw your feet to file/saw through the zip ties. Honestly it might work for duct tape too I don’t see why not but don’t quote me.

So .... you're saying you'll expose your toes for compensation?
“Ah he’s back!” 😂 amazing
Lol
ARE WE NOT TALKING ABT THE TOE SOCKS ????
Everyone congratulate mickey mouse as his new job as a Troom Troom narrator, never been more proud for my boy mickey <3
congrats on trending, Danny
"Gotcha girly"- mickey mouse
the sims music makes this even better
Great job Martin... You did it! *That's a fellony!* What an awful thing to do to someone, what a truly traumatising experience for this young lady. *Great job, dude!*
Mickey mouse voice: Gotchu Girlie👁👅👁
I miss the old voice the new one is annoying also the toe match hack was a hand not a foot. Also is troom troops not know about Stockholm syndrome or what kidnapping even is.🤦🏾
"Troom Troom, are you kidnappers?"   I mean, "under duress" definitely explains their actors, narrators and craft ideas
anyone else get confused by the sims 3 music at the start??!
Reverse stockholm syndrome time.
Kidnapper hack : just steal a tv
Plot twist he actually got kidnapped and was forced to do the sponsorship
last attempt to save his channel
Is this channel only for super young children that have parents that just leave the computer on auto play? If so why don't they just make a children's show? Who is waking in the morning to make these? I have so many questions
nick looks so much like benoftheweek/ ben de almeida
13:37 me to the guy who kidnapped me
I didn’t think the Troom Troom Narration Voice could get any worse…
wow danny is so awesome breaking that sotch tape
i live for this duo
You should do a wikihow video it would be great
I AM GREG AND GREG IS ME , WE ARE GREG'S AND GREG'S ARE US WE ARE ALL A GREG THE ONE TRULY GREG IS US   -YOUR MUM
This almost goes without saying at this point, but I f*ing hate TroomTroom
Can you be 5 minute crafts  fun fact: duck tape is strong in only one way, the other way it is super weak and tearable, i use it a lot when i make things
Duct tape is actually perforated so it can be torn without scissors. I usually just rip it by hand when I need some so it doesn't surprise me that the duct tape "hack" works.
OMFG THE OLD TROOM TROOM VIDEO FROM YOU WAS HOW I FOUND YOUR CHANNEL ITS LIKE AN ANNIVERSARY VKJDF Edit:btw i thought the title was about kidnapping people, not getting un-kidnapped. Big mistake.
Danny looks shockingly good in a scarf.
21:47 OMG THE WINK
I almost spit out my cereal multiple times....
Danny dancing and saying "AOUH AOUH", killed me😭
21:47 I see the edits already, send help
bruh this might be your funniest troomtroom video, i have tears in my eyes
Yeah duct tape is strong but it's really easy tear, most people don't notice the dotted lines that go across it and if youre a criminal,, life hack is to wrap parallel to the wrists aswell rather than just across them
React to food boy next
If you're in the case where they snapped his neck, what you could actually do is stomp on their toe. Toes are extremely fragile and if you angle your heel you'll shatter their toes pretty easily.
Haven’t laughed this hard in a while  Good video 👍
The transformers music tho
14:00  Smart choice, daniel.
"That doesn't make sense to my eyes."
8:08 xd?
Is the person giving the advice Dora the explorer
😂😂
Gotta admit Raidan and Luke Cage are on point and I’d instantly fall in love with my kidnappers after seeing that artwork 🖼 here, take my TVs take all the TVs
Troom troom should do some life hacks for kidnapping people, so we can kidnap people easier
The narrator is snow-white’s Walmart sister.
"Help! Let me go."
That was beautiful
He looks like male version of Betty
“GoTcHa GiRLy” makes me want to burst my eardrums
I think these people took Polly by Nirvana the wrong way.
EY YO WHATS UP WITH THE SIMS 3 MUSIC?
The dislikes are from kidnappers who have been foiled by the hacks
11:48 was that another jojo refrence?               Bucciarati's theme start's playing
Truly troomatizing
9:10 was that a        jojo refrence? Giorno's theme starts playing
2:12 more useful than troom troom's whole video
I turned on notifications and subscribed am I truly Greg?
Tbh I saw this a long time ago cus a youtuber made a reaction to the hack from a TikTok compliation before troom troom made their video sooooo..... yeah
Thanks for giving me a real good laugh today Danny!! Love ya buddy - fellow Greg
Danny's wink and smug little smile when he slipped out of the ropes AHHHH
hihi
"Arrivederci" means goodbye/see you later in Italian XD
today is another episode of?
I thought Nick would be shorter
14:18 okay that caught me off guard
20:33 is captioned "yeah, it's going, I mean it's" but he's actually saying "it cuts to him wearing a beanie" - it's not picked up on autosubs at all so thought I'd write it out in case anyone needs it!
Is the narrator's fav delicacy helium?
Come see what they've done to the Arc of Triumph in my last video !!!!!!!!
What happened to the voice over chick? It wasn't great to begin with but at leas the old one didn't make my ears bleed.
This guy is the chandler of YouTube with these one liners
I wouldn't want to imagine what will happened if someone would just go into Walmart looking for ski masks.
Danny " Yeah, this kinda confirmed that this could actually work." YES , IF YOUR KINDNAPPER LIGHTENS YOUR MATCHES AND BURN THE TIES IT COULD WORK, SUPRISE
Are you getting strangled? 😀
Can you react to scardy cat it’s on Netflix and it’s really weird
I almost got thrown out of my house because I couldn't stop laughing the whole duration of this video (well not during the sponsor read)... It was 2:30am when I started
This is my favourite new video. I laughed throughout
So good
22:10 Danny's bones got squishy
This is what makes me happy
As a kidnapper I’m deeply offended by these Troom troom videos
the scotch tape hack works on zip ties too! tighten the zip ties as tight as you can for it to have a higher chance of succeeding, and use the same motion they did with the elbow being pulled to their sides. no need for matches :)
3:08 r those……… *TOE SOCKS??????*
I love the commitment Danny has for these videos man…I mean renting an entire garage😭👏🏽
With the mask on, you look like you hava a giant eyebrow
9:19 Oh. That looks like a Chiropractor move. It'll probably make your spine feel weird, but it wouldn't kill you. Unless you have a glass spine.
You're giving me wonderful ideas! Thank you
The sims background music though 🤣
Danny’s face when he realized the tape thing worked 😭😭
"nah its duck tape" His disappointment.
Why does the narrator sound like Missy from Big Mouth 💀
I just started watching nick’s channel and now y’all are friends. Cool.
Danny: Won't use hot glue because it might burn him Also Danny: Sees no problem with melting plastic with a burning match held less than an inch from his unprotected skin 😂
You can do the duct tape break with zip ties too
These kidnappers don’t have a TV, but they DO have a PS5? Mmmmmkay.
I can imagine being kidnapped and my kidnapper starts coughing and said there are a bunch of fuzzys floating around
Holy shit danny on trending
Never let Danny read Wattpad stories about Kidnapping or on a second thought demand Danny to read a wattpad kidnapping story.
" And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds. " [ the interpretation of verse 21 : 107 in Qur'an ] Qur'an is the Book We Muslims believe it's words of God , Qur'an do speak about science , it was revealed more than 1400 years ago, it's mentioned in chapter 21 verse 30 ( interpretation of the meaning ) " Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe? "  (1) The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. Thus the Muslim’s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allaah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. Allaah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allaah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people’s hearts. The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allaah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allaah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allaah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allaah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it. (2) The effects of Islaamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following: Prayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a "powerful support," which is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islaam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: "Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer." If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist? Now let us look at zakaat (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islaam. Zakaat purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it. Fasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure. Hajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allaah, which was built by Ibraaheem (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allaah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world WhatsApp +96560078257
am i crazy or am i hearing sims 3 music in the background
10:05 her poker face kills me everytime
got kidnapped :/
Danny Hispanic and the Troom Trooms
epic tickling session!😻
Instead of wearing a dumb scarf, just open your back seat doors first. Thats like. One of the top 4 rules of Zombieland or something.
I love Danny Devito
'idk why anyone would wanna watch this'  2 million of us: 👁️ 👄 👁️
no one talking about her socks.. 🤮
Thanks to their lifehacks Anyone wanting to pursue them wont tug their scarf     Theyl just use music wire
This video Made me laugh so hard!!
Easily one of your best videos to date. I struggled not to laugh out loud during work. Great job, kidnappers!
Now I see why the Minecraft Baddie SMP broke down! Turned more bitter than I thought..
9:40 yes it will kill someone don't do it  unless you really want to
I guess if you have a Tesla, you can't BREAK THEIR BONES 😔
The voiceover from these videos is the worst I've ever heard from Troom Troom
I binged your game channel and I forgot you do this, I can't go back 💀💀
12:56 they look like thongs
Stupidity: *exits*  Danny: _I will end this being at once_
People who like feet are weird but you can trust me.
alright so thankfully i’ve never been kidnapped, right, but last year i did have some guys try to rob me, however i didn’t have any money and they ran off as soon as a car drove up. anyway the troom troom characters feeling sorry for their kidnappers and buying them gifts is weird BUT i would just like to say that a few days later i found a dollar bill in my bedroom and LEGITIMATELY my first thought was “oh, i can give this to those guys who were asking for my money”
Now why is this giving me anxiety?💀💀😭
The conversation they had after the "that's the best way to be!" guy confirms a few social anxiety fears
the scarf bit was so funny
Troom troom would know about kidnapping, its how they get their actors.
remember the time they used ur last name for a bad guy character HAHAAAHA
We actually earned the duct tape hack in my forensics class lmao
Nick needs more attention!
Damn wish I had these hacks when I got kidnapped
God the voice in the first video is so incredibly annoying
legitimately surprised about the tape one
Nick is learning how to be the ultimate kidnapper after this video I'm not sure I would trust him
Snapping a neck would end them or paralyse them for the neck down
the narrator sound like she’s trying to talk like Snow White
The reveal that a single lifehack work's was some Shamilan tier stuff.
I think cat phones are stronger am I wrong or nah
Martin and Kevin just wanted to feel the thrill of b̶a̶t̶t̶l̶e̶ kidnapping
Ur video is on trending #2
Is that Gus Johnson at 1:33?
I swear the narrator's voice is like nails on a chalkboard...
Bruh those youtuber that make' video how escape from kidnappers' didnt think that the kidnapper is human with around 3 digit iq , if you gonna kidnap someone at least prepare the tools for it maybe a rope and tape ,while restraining pls tied the hand and legs not the body and using like socks tied to the hand so they cant use their fingers, maybe strip and search for any tools on the body wether its like a match stick,glasses, even a hair pin   And last but not least ..... You know what maybe this should be enough
Did the Troom Troom narrator voice get worse?
Buying views that sad
I like Danny & Nick working together, they're funny
Nick: YoUr SkIn Is NiCe, FoR a YoUTUbEr… Danny: 😑
Ooo, scary. Lucky for me I’m familiar with the Bittenbinder Method.
Bones.... I saw the statue...
ThEsE lItTlE bLaCk FuZzY tHiNgS, I ThInK I iNhAlEd OnE *coughs and slowly dies*
my top kidnapping hack is to keep small nutcrackers in my bag so that I can throw them at potential guns
OK OK WAIT WHAT " if u have a box of matches, u can think of so many games ... "  There are literally children watching this ????
11:14 thats actually right
Danny why is your hair turning gray I thought you were 12
heres a bit of a through back but you should do a movie review on The Prodigy (2009) kind of a kung fupanda rip off
hold on was that song in the intro the sims 3 music?
Hey guys do not forget to educate yourself on irl kidnap victims and missing people. It was just Indigenous Peoples Day, and I wanna remind everyone to do research on the MMIW crisis. Thank you.
9:09 that was a weird way to speak italian
13:55 Dammit Danny, ruined my whole Tuesday.
The coughing part really got me🤣🤣
Hope you’re doing well, Danny
Little did we know, the robber emoji does actually exist… 🔫
Danny in a hat stresses me out for some reason…..am I in trouble
Dear Danny, that's not how humans wear scarfs.  Best wishes, a Martian
Bye!! * collapses*
In reality it is impossible for a human to kill someone by snapping their neck like the movies
Nice crafting corner
danny is so quirky for this 🤪
Danny is the level 100 mafia boss
Btw "arrivederci" is "bye" in italian😂
I'm a new Greg best decision of my life
The selfie eating the banana was perfect
I cant believe how much i laugh from your videos
i'm like 80% sure danny's background music is sims 3 music?
_Arrivederci, losers!_
Man, if I had a nickel for everytime I ran around, doing something crazy, and being kind of a goofball. Just to end up dropping my phone and shattering it into 100,000 pieces.
arrivederci is Italian. TroomTroom is made in Italy.
Now I hope I get kidnapped so I can try these out😝 I also hope that the kidnapper is Danny fan and they are amazed at the skills😂
The Chinese government sincerely invites independent people from California to visit!
😅😂
Why does your seat go down so slow😭😭
I think I’m in love with nick
Danny: Picking up items with homemade toe socks Nick: Who would want to watch this? 2.3 million people: 🙃
29:02 nick’s cat escaping the tomb
I thought everyone had toe socks lol they are so comfortable
the narrator sounds like TehMimi on helium
I dont know if its wrong to call these "hacks" retarded, but damn they really pop braincells.
Are we not gonna talk about The Sims music?
Proud to say that I actually learned some kidnap escaping techniques from Unus Annus
Dude the girls voice is so annoying
Ur trending let’s goooooooo
The chemistry is impeccable
Danny: "Ah. Get outta my throat."  Michael Scott: "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!"
13:00 Vĕņœm
i have a motorola and rhinoshield doesnt have a case for it 😔
Every day Danny looks more and more like an 11-year-old.
Lol why does troom troom exists???
yes
i hear sims 3 music
The lengths this man goes to test these out it amazing,praise our saviour Danny.
dany funni gonna shre tis to me frends.
"Guns don't kill people criminals kill people...and criminals are guns"
Plot twist the real kidnapper is filming and forcing them to film
nick kidnapping danny is hilarious if youve watched them play minecraft together
In the second video technology yes they are not legally allowed to chase you.
30:23 hey that's like my pfp
Trash video
Trash video
Trash video
Trash video
Danny: *choking on black fuzz* Me who reads Junji Ito: oh no
It's weird because they are occasionally really funny, like the image with the babies in ski masks or the cardboard Mortal Kombat TV. But then they lose it.
Yes that kills people
but did you buy your kidnapper a tv or a ps????
Does anyone miss the old outro- ~~This video is over now, over now.  You'll find something else to watch or, just watch this video again. I know we had a lot of fun, a lot of fun.  But you can't stay on this end screen forever, no.  This video is over now, over now.  So why are you still watching?~~
You’re on trending! You’ve come so far so proud of you! Love your content it’s honestly so hilarious!
What I found unsettling in this type of content. Like 5 minutes craft and this garbage is the setting of the room. And how the sound of the narrator is.
I am geg
it’s funny bc i’ve actually seen the duct tape trick online before troom troom so i know it does technically work but it’s still so funny
Troom trooms actors definitely speak simlish (Sims language) they just sound like ROO BLABLA, ROSHOW GAHAHAHA
U tryna make kids kill themselves
I got really excited for a second, thinking the assailant was Kurtis
24:43 i didn't even notice at first nick saying "WHY I OUGHTTA"
Why does the narrator sound like she’s trying to impersonate Mickey mouse
Duck tape does break easily
What i learned was that if you are kidnapped in US just scream  'Alexa call the police
The cringe
Danny: I probably have to cut the tip off, the tip was blocking the stuff         *my child sense of humour*  Ehehe yes 😈 (read in a maniacal french voice)
i don’t think i’ve ever laughed this hard at a video
Crazy Dave from PvZ be like 4:48
😂 lol🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
Let’s go Brandon!!
Sounds like my mind... both sides of it. Criminals are loaded!!🔫😏 I want to have criminals on my wall!...💖 Loved the skarf hack is pretty genius, knew about the other hacks and the match tale which only few incidents occured where it worked one sadly led to the guy setting himself on fire.
In Jesus name To them this isn't a fair trade You can't go full force on a family member like you would a stranger You could be a smooth criminal & get away A family member Doesn't need you at the crime scene "Look officer Here's their full name Date of birth Current address Demographics The brand of clothing they wore that day Their daily routes Their list of assets" You go to school & they're not popular at all This is segregated family See how enormous the world is outside this family? You do all that Threatening me w/a gun 🔫 makes you a winner? From experience My cuz Oscar got a gun charge during a routine traffic stop 🚦 When they searched his vehicle they found his firearm & added a gun charge 911 so&so has a 🔫 Here's their license & you don't want to be called a p**$y I get to call you a "P*$$Y" as many times as I want Sounds like a fair trade to me to these Dovies Rules you made up Who do you think you are? Detroit Pistons before Jordan' Championship Reign? In Jesus name amen
hey its buddah dog the dog wit da buddah on its hedddd
Hope u bought nick a tv after all this
i can’t speak welsh
gotcha girlie🥰🥰🤪🤪
It’s the tellytubby sun baby
I can’t possibly make myself sound as weird as the narrator lady. It’s not very annoying to me, it’s just weird
frogy
How tf uis this allow on YouTube?!
Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single seconds
Can we talk about the sims 3 background music??
well i guess the censored phrase of son of a bitch, "son of a gun" makes sense. oki
I woke up at 5am to take my morning shit and saw this 30 min vid on the tiolet and was laughing my ass off 😂 hilarious
4:25 That's like opposite Stockholm Syndrome
That's genius Kevin!
I subbed and clicked that bell. Am I Greg now?
I saw the instagram post with you nick and kurtis so i knew there was a great video coming lmaoo
please subscibe
i cant tell what’s worse. the narrator’s voice or the “life hacks”
It was a very nice scarf you butchered
Wow I can't believe Danny did so well pretending to be another person this time! This "Nick" character looks nothing like him and the editing is seamless
“Straighten yourself”  Me a raging pansexual: LENDNEWISLWL
Can we quickly talk about how that girl was wearing toe socks
I haven't laughed this hard in a while and thank you, I really needed it. When Nick just moved over seats whilst you slowly moved back, I lost it- 🤣   Also, thanks Nick for the bonus life hack ✌🏻
The ski mask looks like my old batman costume
Guess kidnappers need to find a new carrer now smh
This video was actually hilarious I had tears in my eyes when nick was chocking danny
The kidnap skit is like a Dhar Mann video but they ain't even trying to convey a point
Nice video mr gooden
the only one that is proven to work is the one danny didn’t think was gonna work at all??
Is it just me or does anyone else think the scotch tape might have been harder to break out of. The duct tape yea it’s sticky and much stronger however it’s got grooves on it that are made to be ripped. Scotch tape though doesn’t and is also pretty stretchy. Although you’d need much more scotch tape it might be harder to break out of.
7:45 i have that pilloecase, it's from ikea
I hope we see more from these two !! Super funny dynamic !!
emily did a jojo reference
Yo Danny, why is the background music the sims 3 CAS song?
Harry use the cloak of invisibility
As this video progressed, it suddenly became one of my favorite Greg videos
Hang on, the kidnappers name is Kevin, dang the kid from home alone really said “if you cant beat em, join em”
*High amount of appreciation for the Sims 3 build/buy menu music in the background*
Bro I would never trust troom troom with my life at risk lmao
this made me laugh too much not to comment for engagement
dannys face is the perfect mix of phineas and ferb
kkkkk verdade
Dayum this really made me laughing in tears 😭😭😭😭
The narrator makes one syllable of every word a screech
Next Troom Troom video is just going to be the same narrator gleefully listing rape statistics.
E desse jeito kkkk
I literally have not laughed this hard in years
9:18 WHY IS THERE A NAKED MANNEQUIN TROOM TROOM
Troom Troom honestly has the best life hacks ever
he should’ve ended the video with “Arrivederci losers!”
so your telling me, millions of people struggled with the rope, trying to get out, when instead they could've just standup?
I am Greg.
The neck thing is true, but it's a lot harder than it looks and not done like in the video, and if done incorrectly the person you're trying this on could end up a paraplegic. Though both instances work just fine since they won't be able to chase you afterwards. The air compression thing is also true but only if your captor is stupid or you're just that good at hiding the fact that you have your body expanded more than necessary. Same with the duct tape thing, it can work but it really depends on how much tape is actually used, more duct tape means more force needed that you may not have. Though if you do have duct tape on your mouth you can loosen it by licking it, it's very easy.
Her voice is the most annoying sound in the world
MORE NICK MORE NICK MORE NICK
The ppl watching her get kidnapped while walking down the street: 👁 👄👁
everyone knows you cant kidnap people they can put you into a room for that
Arrivederci means bye. Arivedurci means that neither Danny nor Troom Troom speak italian 🤣
okay fuck this made me laugh out loud by myself
This is what i imagine that Belle Delphine tape is like
you know what might work with the scarf part, you could just push the seat back and then rip off the scarf
Whoa....#2 on trending my guy
Oh there they are, my favorite couple. Danroom ship
fun fact, the duct tape maneuver also works if your wrists are ziptied! just pull the tab to make the ziptie tight as possible around your wrist, and then do the same movement.
Troom Troom is glorifying kidnapping and violence. People will literally die if they get kidnapped and use any of their "life hacks". YouTube needs to remove those videos, children and stupid people's life are at risk
Plot twist: this is how troom troom is teaching kidnappers. By showing any mistake they could make.
I really hope these actors in these videos and the narrator, and everyone involved really seriously delete their channel. Its seriously so bad and if kids start to watch their content, that's just...ugh. I dont even know
4:55 4:59😭😭😭😭
This is just our regular hangout, we always do this stuff  nickisnotgreen 2021  god he looks so good  nickisnotgreen 2021
Do these people purposefully make these videos to just mess with the sane population? Because I sincerely pray they don't think anyone actually believes anything they show in their videos. I wouldn't recommend wasting time watching these videos, because they aren't even funny and downright cringeworthy. Thank you Danny and team for throwing away so much precious time for us viewers.
the support these other guys at the storage facility is priceless
Why does he look green
I have a feeling that troom troom is just a high production parody  channel
This is the best vid Danny has ever made my poor roommate had to hear me crying laughing at 3 am watching this
I think that the last time you could fire a match on a wall or shoes or whatever was around the 1900s century 😄 The producers invented a new method because the matches easily lit up in your pockets.
bro the criminal is a gun?? soul eater weapon??
has nobody noticed the sims 3 music
You don’t even have to use matches to burn through zip ties you could   1. Tie your shoelaces around the zip tie and move feet back and forth breaking the zip tie with friction   2. Tightening zip ties with teeth and exerting all force upon your leg to release yourself
1 day ago boys
lmao the high pitched narrator is secretly an evil mob boss
21:47  Danny: winks Me: puberty activated!
Danny is like the ultimate boss to kidnappers
This Video was too hilarious 😂
Question for some of the crafts did u check Amazon or...?
Danny putting a lot of force into throwing it back is on his onlyfans
@Joel Haver be careful! If you ever wanna off Danny, he knows how to escape a kidnapping!
The panic in Danny’s eyes as his scarf fails to save him and then the slow recline has me sobbing
If you got kidnapped there’s always troom troom to help
As a kidnapping survivor troom troom disgusts me to my very core what an absolutely sickening channel!
Wow I guess she took care of those kidnappers at 8:06. Not sure how anyone would survive that.
Is the narrator mickey mouse
Sounds like Britney from the MTV Cartoon *Daria*
the narrator sound like she’s trying to talk like Snow White
Is no one gonna tell Danny that’s not how you wear a scarf? Although it is majestic
Jesus Christ loves you
2:49 “If you have a box of matches, you can think of so many games!” Umm, not only is this a terribly irresponsible suggestion, it’s pretty lazy direction from TroomTroom: what is the craft?
I'd thought that Danny was singing the background vocals of Weezer's 'All My Favorite Songs'.
8:08 me when the snnssjakxjjcaehcasckhakvdahkcdahaehc
I told my little sister to stop watching troom troom but she declined so I decided to go to her and say to watch Danny Gonzales  new video aka u ,then she stop watching the troom troom video's but some of them worked before, she was bored so she ask to try them but she needed my help because  my mom was busy so we tried all of them n some worked
honestly that last one feels good to know. and the breathing in thing since she was attached to a barrel and not a chair
It’s actually funny cause the “scotch tape” life hack is a legit way some militaries train their soldiers on how to escape it works on zip ties btw
8:38 I learnt this trick when I was like 9 and learning about Houdini I think it was how he originally did the straight jacket trick(probably also dislocated something, not sure)
Ok but 4 layers?
Is that Sims 3 Create a Sims music in the background at the start of the video???
Dude what the hell happened to the old narrator
Danny breathing in is so funny
Troom Troom is like a channel that doesn't think twice and would probably make jokes about the Holocaust.
i feel safe now thankyou
“It’s the type of knot you’d tie. You fucking square.”😂😂😂😂
Damn bro the kidnapper went to a quince right after kidnapping someone 😹😹👍
Also please make more videos with nick yall are hilarious together
Not gonna lie I feel like 5 below would have all of the supplies you needed for this….toe socks…..ski mask….just all of it
Thank you for making me lose my shit for half an hour
I laughed the hardest ive laughed in a while
Ok this video was so funny
This is such a good video lol y'all have great chemistry
The fact he didn’t realise that each toe in the sock had its own thingy
Omg I love the crafting corner, I couldn't stop laughing 😂
if you are kidnapped in a car i think you have to somehow break the tail light and wave your hand outside . i dont know if this is true
I'm sorry Danny I cannot watch this full video at once, listening to the narrator is torture.
I dont understand how Danny doesnt see that these troom troom videoes are clearly not serious.
Who's greg?
Why does the kidnapper dungeon look so cool tho? Lowkey wanna be there
i would do this to tiktok people who break my schools fukin bathroom
Listen, we all ignored Danny's cries in Help, Let Me Go and obviously someone did not heed his request to stop kidnapping him. Glad to see Danny escaped
The narrator sounds like... 5 year old Missy from Big Mouth
If Danny had cloven feet, I'd fucking scream 😱
I have a question        ARE U SUBBED TO TECHNOBLADE
I would like to see a Danny Gonzales/Simply Nailogical collab where they just talk about their reluctant fascination with Troom Troom for 30 minutes
I can’t wait to get kidnapped now so that they wrap my wrists in duct tape and I can break out
I have now figured it out. Danny invented troom troom and has slowly been pumping out fucking banger videos every few months on the garbage videos. Genius honestly.
8:15 in a situation where you are stuck in the trunk of a car, a very old tip is to kick out the taillights while the car is in motion, and stick a hand or foot out to get the attention of other drivers
Imagine if you got Stockholm Syndrome
The troom troom narrator is slowly turning into Minnie Mouse
13:26 griffith
2:18 Why am I in the dungeon???? 😭😭😭
Danny is trending, nice
jeez man, i wheeze EVERY SINGLE TIME i watch ur vids :)
E
two years of pandemic garbage have resulted in nick wearing walmart brand crotch-less panties on his face while taping danny’s limbs together. i can’t leave my house, but, things are looking up.
Questions for a “friend”: 1. How much money do the Rhinoshield cases cost? 2. Do they sell in the iPhone 7 model?
I love the wink at 21:49
#2 on trending, let's goooo
girlboss moment
Imagine kidnapping someone with that on they are not going to be scared but they are going to laugh as hard as they can
Skip to 12:34  GIMME UR GET GET GET IN THE CAR
This is going down in the danny hall of fame! Love him and nick together too
Is that a JoJo's reference??
Thought I’d never see the day I saw another troom troom video
Clicked for Nick
I miss your ending music! The “This video is over now” song is my favorite part
Finally, a comment section without OwO in it 😌
are you being strangled?
Nick is giving off major “my big brother forced me to play along with his stupid game” energy.
Thank you for the life hack Denny
I guarantee that these "tricks" are going to get someone seriously hurt if they actually believe in it.
12:14 missed opportunity to say “give me everything tonight”
Danny's laughing but the entire time there's so much stress behind that smile Troom troom takes it out of all of us
this is one of the funniest videos ive watched in awhile
let's be friends my friend
the whole thing with talking with the kidnappers, them being nice to her, making her food etc (first part of the video/first life hack) is just screaming fetish/es (bondage) ugh troom troom on a streak with that shit tho also edit: her eating a banana in the photo is creepy as fuck edit no 2: the one with "breathe in while being tied" is also tense your muscles and push limbs away from each other (ankles and wrists) while being tied. this is real advice edit no 3: there was a naked, life-size female doll/model thing in the background, adding to the creepy vibe. why do I feel like they didn't purchase that for just this video..? (9:10) edit no 4: adding to the creepy vibe once more, it's all women being kidnapped by men
Is the troom troom voice getting more high pitched? Jeezzzz
the narrator need some water
Danny this video was great but I think it’s time for the spooky man to show up
Sims music Also, I can't wear tor socks. I have too many toes
I mean if u had a chance to watch a vid u wouldn’t watch a vid u would call someone
It's so funny that the only hack that works is the one they stole from other people
Dannys pointing that gun kinda sus 15:54
These pieces of shit are just throwing it in our faces that they have a PS5 and we don't.
as much as i don't like troom troom for being annoying, it's kinda weird how they went from creative, harmless pranks or life hacks for everyday and now it ended up like this...  it gives me the whole glitterforever17 vibes all over again
Always S tier content
the duct tape hack is real, i learned about it on schitt's creek
Danny, you're looking a few days older than your last video.
Okay now that was epic
The hack with the duct tape on the wrists was not clear when troom troom said it🤣  but Nick told Danny the correct way to do it somehow. Troom troom was telling them to swing it only.
i always laugh alot during your videos' and im trying so hard to be quite cause its 12:13
Yay #2 on trending page 🤩🤗🥳🥳🥳
Dont fuc wit sotch tape bro
Okay but arrivarci is just a formal way of greeting someone about to leave, and does not imply the likeness of remedying that person; if you’re never going to see that person again you would say “addio” (always from Italian)
Wait a minute your form corridor crew
I can’t wait till the ‘official’ Closed Captions come out to add to this perfection
is that my bestie in a tessy
Cool
He rented a whole garage thats commitment...
Kids its naptime!!!
For those wondering, 'arrivederci' is Italian  for 'goodbye/farewell'.
the chain one is an actual strategy that magicians use for straight jackets and stuff, and the duct tape (i mean scotch tape) one is just a real trick in general the other ones definitely just seemed like something a crafts channel would come up with with no actual basis in the real world
is she...wearing socks with toe slots... oh god
3:09 WHAT ARE THO'S  SOCKS
9:08 PROOF THaT they are KIDNAPPING RANdOM PeoPle (there is a nak*ed person)
#2 on trending just regular trending!
more nick more nick more nick more nick more nick
Number 2 on trending hell yeah
btw the duct tape one is a actually tip when you get tied, but the inside of your wists together not side to side, rest your hands over your head and then as hard as you can just kinda go for it
Troom troom voiceover lady and tiktok TTS is the same person you can't change my mind.
The Minnie Mouse voice going "gotcha girly"  Is something I can never forgive...
I have not laughed so hard since my Ma passed away last month. Thanks Danny.
12:27
“good job, that’s a felony”
Guess what  I'm the real Skyler these true life life hacks are based off my daring escape
Okay but why does troom troom have two guns?
I haven't laughed like this in a while thank you.
look at my boy greg trending ayyeee

NUMBER TWO ON TRENDING BABYYYYYYYYYY
Why does the narrator sound like an off brand Minnie Mouse
Danny asks if they know what a kidnapping is but I want to know if they know what a sketch is.
lawd have mercy
gawd damn
dannys nose ..
nick looks so fine in this
Nice. .👍👍👍
Gimme your- get- get- get in the car
The tape trick working was an amazing twist
Danny are we getting a spooky song this year
23:29 all jojo fans be like: tsk tsk tsk its arivadeci You pathetic pile of dirt.
I hope Danny knows they used a hand for the match striking and zip melting parts
The narrator voice is one of the most annoying sounds I’ve heard (aside from the that tiktok text to speech voice)
I for one am completely confused. Why is Danny letting this guy in a beanie tie him up?
This has PEAK "boys will be boys" energy
How is this legal 🤣on here
The duct tape thing is a pretty well known thing
Yay! Troom troom is finally being useful and showing us how to kidnap people
*arrevadurche, loser*
Almost 5 mil. Great job Danny!!
the panic laughing while getting choked is the funniest thing
“ARIARIARIARIARIARI, ARIVEDERCI
this video was amazing
jeff bezos
I could handle more videos with these two.
I’m honestly amazed at the duct tape one, I never would’ve thought. It’s useful to know this video gave me valuable info “just in case”
Broke: putting leaves in your hair to look like Billie Ellish Woke: put leaves in your hair to look like Anne from Amphibia
The narrators voice sounds like a bad impression of Mickey Mouse
#2 on trending congrats Danny
Oh god the narrator's voice makes me want to go deaf
I just realized something... Instead of cutting the scarf in half, just get the ends that are already  separated. DOI
LAMAOAOA SHE SNAPPED HIS NECK WTF OK troom troom
Danny walking around happily w that scarf *adorable*
The tape life hack does actually work if you do it correctly they did not explain it well what you want to do is you pull your elbows apart and you slam your wrists as hard as you can on your knee or well anything and it'll forcefully rip the tape they did not explain that well in the video but that's actually how you're supposed to do it your supposed to smack your wrist against something and it'll rip the tape this is a real life saving life hack troom troom just did a horrible job and explaining how you're supposed to do it
Nice to see the SImpliSafe Burglars are doing well
This feels like a tutorial on “boys will be boys”
Omg wtf we r out of the office and there’s someone else on screen in addition to danny r u kidding I’m so excited
Danny: makes a joke about hooves while talking about socks Me: *flashback to the lil Wayne hooves tumblr post*
the first vid is giving enemies to lovers arc
Can't believe Troom Troom moved to literal life hacks
7:30 she clearly had Stockholm Syndrome
modern day matches are designed to be lit by the box. if u got kidnapped in the old days this would work
#2 ON TRENDING
This was pure gold 😂
Is no one gonna talk about the naked mannequin at 9:08
Love to watch and have fun
#2 on trending btw
Number 2 on trending, good job! :D
"While the captor is stunned by your AGILITY" i'm dead xD
I had to pause the video twice because I was laughing so hard I started crying. Danny introducing the gun to Nick as a criminal for some reason really got me. He had no idea wtf he was talking about.
“I’m just imagining how much force I’d have to put into throwing it back to crush someone” 😏
Hey hey wow wow wow
Thought we wouldn't notice that Sims 3 music, but we did
I always get exited when it’s more than 20 minutes because I look forward to watching these when I eat dinner
I can’t believe I got an actual lifehack for getting out of duct tape from this video.
វីដេអូល្អមើលមែន
epicly kidnapped :( but not as epic as AMOGUS BOOTY FART
the tape thing also works with the zip ties from the first hack, hurts a lot tho
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
8:08 she straight opened the kidnapper
why’s the car voice seem so aggressive and mean
Hi
"Now time to crush his bones"*moves car sit slowly*
25:03 - It just your car the chair doesnt normally go down slow my car how ever we have to pull somthing then put force on the chair and it goes down quite fast
can this girl stop with the FORCED voice the first one was funny ish this one makes me want to die
Ok but this isn’t realistic at all… Women kidnap too! 😆  In all seriousness how are they legally allowed to post these? They should be fact checked like Facebook posts are.
Your friend omg made this video so hilarious!! You need to have him on the next troom troom
i literally deez
fun fact, the duct taped wrist escape actually works with zip ties too, if a singular zip tie is around your wrists in the same position. one of the very, VERY few actually legitimate hacks this channel has ever offered.
The duct tape thing has been spread around A LOT especially with women. It could save your life and should be spread more ❤️
Number 1 trending?
the most baffling thing about troom troom's videos is the fact that they're made by actual human beings
this is the funniest video ive seen in so long my sibling and i literally cried laughing. the part where danny realizes he could just pick up the match with his hand. the part where nick fully chokes him and you see him realize "oh shit im actually choking" while nick seems concerned but doesnt stop. fucking fantastic.
Calm down & listen to God's voice
still waiting for this years halloween bop
The webtoon ad 😕
i live alone, time to try the duct tape thing😛
i laughed way too hard on this video
who’s danny what greg
The duct tape thing is move down while pulling your elbows apart. So like arms up, as you pull them down bend you arms and move your elbows apart
Very funny. Love the Danny and Nick duo
“perfectly wrong”
“Did you test this on your face?” Yeah he coughed in it you lucky boy
is the tv delivery guy doing an Ernest impression
idk if I have ever laughed so hard at anything on the internet more than during the scarf moment when the scarf didn’t rip in two and then that whole car scene omg hahahaha
9000th comment
More nickisgreen
11:51 is it bad that my first reaction was "kinky"
Why does the music sound like the background in sims
Did you know that criminals bind you really tight and do several wraps and tie your legs to the chair legs? ........ OMH...
Why does troom troom get a ps5
The “uuuunn rruhrururuh 🤬” sound always sends me. GrayStillPlays’ old reliable
“Get out of my throat” 🥰
I wouldn’t mind if troom troom got kidnapped…
Are you tied up with scotch tape?   *P E R F E C T !*
“ phew testing Those hacks where challenging, it was rough it was tough.   * gets strangled*  ahhhHhaHahhhHhHhhhhhHhhhhhH”
If your in a trunk kick out the tail light
You guys should totally do more Life Hack Collabs! This was hilarious
As a scarf person I genuinely got upset when he cut that beautiful scarf in half
stop calling me greg. i don't like it.
narrator straight out of mickey mouse club house
Can’t wait to see 10:18 in the next Danny Gonzalez out of context video 😂
Random Comment
that was an experience i will never forget, something about the phrase "hooved creature" unlocked something in me and i spent the last 15 minutes laughing myself into a tummyache
"Are you tied up with scotch tape? Perfect!" -troom troom
699 dislikes on the video, y'all better not dislike anymore >:(
Danny dropping his phone made me scared asf
Ayo ngl that wink got to me
I hope this being #2 on trending convinces Danny to do more videos on Troom Troom and other terrible life hacks
The amount of videos that Danny has done on troom troom the least they can do is make a video on him   Side note:DO A COLLAB
God don't you hate it when you get kidnapped? So annoying.
When you introduce Nick at 16 minute in, he kind of reminds me of Moss from IT Crowd.
1:27 did they just use the metal gear solid sound here but pitch up the sound to avoid copyright?
ARE THOSE TOE SOCKS 3:33
I knew a criminal who was good at art and craft it his name was named Adolf Hitler
This was such a good video!
I like your new chair
The narrators voice-cracking and cheery demeanoris so bad I don’t think I can watch this-
Dany and Joe give me the same vibes
I subscribed. I am finally Greg 🙌
Imagining my car with its automatic seat buttons trying to “crush” my captor
Hard pass... I'll figure my own way out.
LOL
4:43 When they pushed her on the bed I went 👁👄👁
I have electric car seats and I don't wear scarves, so I guess I'll die.
I’m so happy Danny came up on my page. His “Emma Watson’s watch son” vine was one of my favorite vines and I’m so happy that his content still cracks me up
Kurtis laughing in the background is killing me😭
Why do I feel like Danny and nick are secretly in love
The duct tape escape I heard it’s Zipties that work with the up down or you raise your hands up and bring it down on your hip
This is the absolute hardest I've ever laughed at a YouTube video
They clearly assumed that the kidnappers were using strike anywhere matches.
The girl in the first video probably has Stockholm Syndrome
ITS BEN I think
My gaydar goes off at all of Troom Troom‘s staff.
nick: “i felt like i was choking you tho, for a while there..” danny: “yeah, you WERE”
I’m my college dorm one night they did a lesson on how to break out of zip ties, it’s the same way as the duct tape hack!
Remind me to not kidnap Danny!! Seriously. That would be illegal and weird
🦇
fuckin' square
Okay number 2 on trending
Arrivederci is actually Italian for until we meet again
can't believe you forgot to circumcise the glue
The scarf bit had me dying!
IAM a big fans
bro why is troom troom trying to groom their audience? like what is the point of making a video downplaying the seriousness of abduction, other than to manipulate the oftentimes _very_ young kids that watch their channel?
The narrator literally sounds like if missy from bigmouth took steroids
I'm a budget kidnapper so I'm glad I know to use at least 4 layers of 'scotch' tape
Laughed so hard at your tests. Clearly, these are all excellent and viable life hacks for if you are ever kidnapped.
Snapping necks DOES, in fact, tend to kill people, Daniel.
The original meaning of kidnap, dating from the late seventeenth century, was "steal children to provide servants to the American colonies
damn its going to be 2030 and danny gonzalez will still be making videos about the exact same things

as a non-american, the fact that there was an alexa just chilling on the wall of a random garage is the most american thing in this video tbh.

hi
Danny choking on the black fuzzies reminds me of SpongeBob when he wouldn't write his essay and choked on eraser shavings lol
on the bright side if you die from "accidentally" setting yourself on fire, you're free 👍
The troom troom trend is over now its 123 Go
I just wanted you to know that I thought you were testing better ways to kidnap people until the video started
13:54   *for free*
Danny looks surprisingly good in a scarf
TROOM TROOMS BACKKKK
29:55 "they also have collaborations with huge brands like the NBA, NASA..."  Bruh NASA doesn't do fashion collabs, their logo just isn't copyrighted so it can be used by anyone.
excelente!!! amei ❤
I absolutely love that Danny used Sims music in the background of this video. I don’t know if he did it purposely or not, but it gave me a major nostalgia boost, so thanks bestie 😊
why is no one talking about her socks in the first hack tho
u have to twist and down onto ur knee
Is it just me, or when the lady with the scarf was being choked, she straight up put her chair back like a robot, like she planned for this LMAO, 10:03
If you punch someone in the guy while tying them up you can knock the wind out of them and the rope will be tight
I tought strike anywhere matches were like an american thing, never actually seen those. Are they real? Do they make them any more? Or is it just a movie thing? Are they rare? From movies and such you'd thing they are only matches you can buy on US.
21:47
excelente!!! amei ❤

They have to be in on the joke, they're purposely trying to be memed at this point.
Can't believe nickisnotgreen would kidnap Danny like that smh my head
lookin like a hooved creauture
Don’t know why I was so caught off guard by Nicks size, is that just me??
THE FOOT KILLED ME
HiiiiuiiiiiiH
Love the video. I think another funny video idea would be you reacting to boomer comments you get on your videos
Congrats on #2 on trending!
“So let’s say the kidnapper trows you in the back of the truck”
“You don’t know a thing about me. You wouldn’t last a day in my scarf.”
hey there is a movie called The Donkey King. You sould make a video on it.
Movie Review Idea: Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights. It would definitely get at least an 8 on the Not-Yet-Named Scale. It tries to be a feel-good holiday movie but fails miserably. It's a confusing, creepy train wreck of a movie about Hanukkah featuring Adam Sandler's ego, unfunny gags, really annoying voices, and a woman with three breasts.
Haha funny
thanks bro, almost tried it on some kids at the mall.
The undertale dungeon music is triggering 😂
i dont know why but "damn...imma pull up to the shoot tomorrow lookin like a...hooved creature" fucking TOOK ME OUT
That WIIIIIINK
You should punch sand in your next video.
Practically spewed out my ice cream during the "Danny I feel like I'm choking you" part 😂😂😭😭
I don't think most people would be able to get the right angle or amount of force to snap a neck from that position, youd be better off gouging the eyes.
Your eyes are telling the story of little to no sleep there at the end, bruhva
Hey why is nick so cute
The lighting in this..so crisp
the car one you could just, PULL OUT YOUR 1861 ENLISTED GENERAL ISSUED MUSKET AND FIRE AT THEM, THEN PULL OUT YOUR COLT .44 AND FIRE ALL 6 ROUNDS AT THEM, THEN PULL OUT YOUR SABRE AND STAB THEM DEAD
How can the kidnappers manage to grab a girl that size with so much ease? I know it’s fake, but still.
25:35 Gon and killua running
this had me crying and pissing. im not just saying that. i had to clench
Always remember to circumcise your glue
Thanks this realy helped
0:22 I'M BEING KIDNAPPED!! *happy troom troom music
I told my science teacher about you Mr. Danny sir
When you have a PS5 but no TV
3:35 scares me so much even though I know that’s not her foot but imagine if she could do that
The first one definitely had Stockholm Syndrome
5:35 I pooed my pant .
I cannot think of a more insufferable voice to narrate TroomTroom videos.
I got a amber alert while watching this😞
so we gonna talk about that wink danny did or???
NICKI SNOT GREEN collecting commentary youtubers like infinity stones. Love to see it
Nick as a self defense/ how to escape a kidnapping would be great
8:07 what the hell am i looking at?
This is number 2 on trending. Congrats Danny 🤠
Great video, stay lit 😎
To tell u I wheeeezed when he just stood up and was free
Out for one day and still number 2 on trending
Danny you're #2 on trending worldwide
Danny missed his calling in Vogue
“Hey guys my name is nick and hopefully you don’t have an opinion different than mine or me and my internet army will shame and bully you!”
In all honesty, it’s for the best that these hacks suck
NOOOOO THAT NICK KID SUCKS
Kidnapper Au Nick: would you like a sailors knot or a regular shoelace knot I know I kidnapped you and stuff but as a host it is my duty to make you—— LMAO I CANT EVEN TYPE WITH A STRAIGHT FACE WTF AHHAHAHAHA
i literally havent laughed this hard in FOREVER
you set off my alexa and i will never forgive you
What is that thing in the bottom left corner 9 mins and 10 secs
12:26 *Kim Kardashian entered the chat*
Actually so shocked the duct tape (sorry, scotch tape) trick worked! And their excitement about it made it even better
budget kidnapper
Yeah you Americans, always gotta cut the tip off... Smh
Nick would be a very considerate kidnapper LMAO
Stockholm Syndrome be like
#2 on trending, also happy birthday Danny
Why hasn't Drew pinned a comment on this video?
When Danny's friend didn't understand his joke. I felt that
Meet the Robbingtons
the ending lol 31:13
I don’t even wear scarves ;—;
every time they pronounce arrivederchi wrong it makes me wanna stab my eardrums
Danny I just wanna say watching a this made me laugh the most I think I’ve laughed all year
Oh... I thought it would teach you how to kidnap people.... 😢
When are we getting the “get in my, ge-ge-get in the car” song
Killing stalking
i think its actually great that the match didnt light up exactly when he was holding it between his toes, because most glues are flammable so i bet there is actually a high chance  that his super cool toe socks would of caught fire.
These hacks are so worthless, we all know the real way to get out of a kidnapping scenario: just scream "Help, let me go"
* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much! To have proof of this, we can say that he emptied himself of all his glory and stepped on the earth! Isn't that wonderful? And there's more! He assured us of salvation! He fulfilled the mission that God gave him! Which is to have a death on the cross for all people in the world! * How do I get to heaven? * It's very simple! -Accept Jesus as your Lord and only Savior! - Repent of your sins daily even those you don't know because you sinned out of ignorance! -Recognize that you do not deserve God's salvation but even with your faults He wanted to save you with his great love and grace! Now about keeping your faith -Read the Bible daily -Pray and fast -Go to a church that follows the word of God  May God bless you greatly! 👋
Why is there droids in the background of dannys dungeon
… I kinda wanna test that duck/scotch tape hack now
the cutesy "gotcha girly" voiceover the kidnapping is... bone chilling
I love hearing Kurtis just hidden in the background
Less nickisnotgreen. He is the character from the movie they can't make me like
One thing Troom Troom did do right though is at 9:19 . If you're ever in a situation where someone tries to choke you like this make sure your chin is facing toward their elbow. It's easy for them to push down on your windpipe if you are facing the middle of the arm, but it's harder for them to choke you if you are facing the inside of their elbow.
I can't describe how much I want to hit the narrator with a chair cause of her voice
I love how nobosy questions Danny on anything, they just go with it
Did Troom Troom take fighting classes or something? Are they certified?
the chaos of this video!
First one sounds like a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome
Congrats on 2nd trending
Bo that fore head [  : )
I can't believe the duct tape one works. The Mythbusters can literally make a functioning boat out of that shit, but apparently you can snap 3 layers of it just with a swift arm motion.
if you're reading this, I wish you happiness and wealth <3
This child should not be making crafts unsupervised
Troom Troom‘s Stockholm syndrome arc
when the duct tape strategy is a real method that troom troom prob found online
I came to get help trying to escape a kidnapper, but I left knowing how to kidnap the kidnapper
"oh god get out of my throat" - danny gonzalez 13:36
I enjoyed this video
YES NICK
Moral of the story never try to kidnap Danny
5:13 Troom Troom must subscribe to the idea that guns kill people rather than people killing people
Y O U  G U Y S  P L A Y I N G  T H E  T O E  M A T C H  G A M E
Yesssss a Nick and Danny collab
I LAUGHED THE WHOLE VIDEO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No offense but a girl like her is actually pretty safe
you got nice skin. for a youtuber. tf does that mean 💀
Imagine teaching little kids that kidnapping is fun.
The voice of the narrator sounds like a drugged up mickey mouse on helium.
You can tell Danny’s a guy bc when the two kidnappers threw her on to a bed and started threatening her with violence, he made a joke about how the yelling was technically scary compared to everything before. But just the visual a girl being forced onto a bed by two possibly violent men is enough to make most women and others very uncomfortable very quick 😬😬😅 Edit. Spelling
Praise God 🙏🏾
Yo the beanie crafting really got me. Bitch over here looking like a thrift store Venom 😂😂
Nick: "did you test this on yourself  Danny: *doesn't reply*
when danny went from the dramatic “ahh, ahhhh” to “oh crap, he’s actually choking me” but continuing on laughing with nick as he was getting strangled and nick just pointing out he feels like he’s actually choking him while still going full force with it made me burst out laughing. he choked him OUT 😭
sumthing abt the premise sits so sour in my gut. It just feels like it's turning sumthing hyper fucked up and happens all the time into a goofy thing for kids. I've seen kids media make kidnapping jokes before but it just never felt as weirdly insensitive the og vid was for sum reason, I dunno why.
also why are the matches so long
Danny looks so handsome in this video 😭😭💓
CONGRATES ON BEING #2 ON TRENDING AS OF NOW
1st, get a van
Gonna be honest... Based on the title of the video, I'm disappointed this doesn't cover hacks on how to kidnap...
They were very awful. 0/10
🌸✨🎀There’s our victim!🎀✨🌸
I'm starting to feel like Troom troom knows they are ridiculous...they've gotta be trolling. Right??
This is Very useful thank you Danny for the advice
This was one of the funniest videos i’ve seen in a long time. thank you danny for all the smiles and laughs. 😁
Omfg someone is at my house with a criminal! 😂😂😂😂
So no one is gonna talk about how she has socks with toes fitted
"how hard to you have to throw it back to crush someone?"
Not the criminals!
Oh God! My stomach hurts from laughing sooooo hard!! 😂😂
we can stop China from recovering Taiwan! Why can't stop the Afghan Taliban?
How is no one commenting on the Sims music??
NICK!!!<3
22:08 what's that troom troom
It's not Scotch tape it's Dutch tape
life hack: when you get kidnapped, escape and then give the kidnappers the ransom they asked for. because, after all, the kidnappers are the real victims here
NOT THE TOE SOCKS
That was cool
#1 on trending! ☝️ I jinxed it
Damn, 2 on trending at this moment.
HOLD UP 8:35 WAS THAT JACKSEPTICEYE????
my friends own so much criminals
This time I’m eating stale potato chips
I was actually surprised to see that the duck tape thing actually works
arivaderci means "until we meet again"  are they planning on seeing the kidnappers again?
Oh no, I’m being kidnapped. Says me in a calm way
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
what happened to danny gamezolez?
Ok this video is so funny I’m watching it again😼
About the “snapping neck” thing yea it does actually work Danny. Ofc cuz it’s troom troom they dramatized the hell out of it. If someone reaches from behind to choke u idk why but twisting their neck the way they showed it will actually have them back off because you’re “snapping their neck”
9:29 I mean shit it seems like that would works tbh. Snap your kidnappers neck guys
plot twist r2d2 in the back is the actual kidnapper
Danny #1 on trending. Can we just take a moment.
That chain bit where you tense up and hold your breath so theres a gap i think is actually based on how to escape from a straight jacket 😂
the mask was so ineffective that i immediately went "oh nick is in this video" even though he was wearing the mask
These videos are so fucking dangerous
Oh lord
Holy shit the Alexa lmao 🤣
The kidnappers would let you watch this because of the confidence boost
this video was so fucking funny
It’s almost Halloween ;)
this vid is so funny lmao
kurtis laughing as the cameraman is so funny wait nvm it’s not kurt wtf
why has the troom troom voice reached an even higher pitch
Hey I was wondering if u could react to wife swap I love it it’s so funny and cringe
The criminals has ps5 but not tv 😂
I love how Danny is struggling to pick up the match with his foot and Nick is like "pick it up with your hand."
i like to think the gun on the wall is the second criminal that also got kidnapped by nick because it betrayed him
the brief moment of fear when the scarf actually started strangling him was really funny even though it also looked sketchy as hell
9:21 I do Bjj This will not work if you are in a rear-naked choke there are many things you can do trying to snap their neck like an anime character is not one of them
the one dude in the yellow shirt just looks so much like jez from peepshow
The narrator sounds like their voice is being controlled by a child with a slide whistle, shit makes me wanna rip my ears off and throw them across the street
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him "go and sin no more"-Jesus
Do you have a mask tan?
I think Danny actually had fun doing these Troom Troom hacks.
31:14
Omggg the testing part i cannnt😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Okay Danny being #1 on trending 😙😙😜
The Sims 3 CAS music  in the beginning is my favorite thing about this
The voiceovers hurt my whole soul.
1 Corinthians 8:6  Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
James 2:19  You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!
this got me belly laughing, thank u
Isaiah 43:11  I, I am the Lord, and besides me there is no savior.
genuinely the hardest ive laughed in a while
At this point. Troom Troom is a comedy sketch YouTube Chanel
Isaiah 44:6  Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.
1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
That girl deserves to be kidnapped if shes wearing toe socks, that was the actual last thing i expected when she took off her shoe
youre a god
#1 on trending!!!! go danny!!!!
“Dude, matches smell like shit.” - drew gooden. Silly drew that’s the smell of plastic.
Great job on being #1 on the trending page, Danny!!!
me waiting for a circumcision joke when fanny forgets to cut off the tip of the glue: 👁_👁
Troom Troom exists in a world where people think Home Alone and Ruthless People actually happened
the sims 3 bop in the background 💃🏼
My dad likes collecting criminals ✨
Congrats on trending #1.  The most relevant YouTuber nowadays.  I love your troom troom videos the most.
Would you like to join the legion?
I like your eyes 👀
You likey ?
at 12:12 you cannot see any case on Danny's phone.... just saying
THE TOES
NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING GREAT JOB DANNY
danny holding his breath looks like the hulk about to transform- i can’t stop laughing
Does anyone know what Danny’s office chair is called
troom troom bad
29:02 Vordt of the Boreal Valley starts playing
9:09 is… is no one gonna talk about the mannequin that’s sliced in half half or…
Is no one going to mention the naked mannequin on the floor in that second troom troom vid?
5:14 Describing Juzo Inui of No Guns Life 😁😁😁🤣😂
Those toe socks caused me real-life psychic damage
diy beanie mask got that femto aesthetic
you forgot to give him a PS5 and a TV
I like that Danny is uploading more often now.
congrats on #1 trending!
My dude IS #1 ON TRENDING. You made it bro. The oysterworld is yours.
The -scotch- *duct* tape trick works on zip ties too.
congrats on #1 trending!
YO NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING
I would find a tutorial on how to get kidnapped better than these.
nice job on trending
Nice hat @30:00
#1 on trending!!??!! Fuck ya
Wait, is troom troom sponsored by playstation? Also, how in the world do they have a PS5 but not a tv
number one on trending i love you danny and nick so proud
3:53 she magicly have a 3rd hand thats pretty impresive
Nick was such an amazing gun in this video! really helpful as a kidnapper too. Hope he comes back for other less threatening stuff!
imagine getting kidnapped and just be like "hold on can i have my phone and look at troom troom for a sec"
#1 guy lets get cool
Nice 1 on trending. Bullying troop troop is god tier shit
3:09 is no one gunna talk about the socks
anyone else think that was benoftheweek at first lmao?
Danny saying “What the fuck!!!!” Excitedly when he breaks the tape is the only thing keeping me alive rn tbh
For those unaware, modern matches are usually made so that part of the ignition is on the box itself where you strike the match. This is for safety reasons.
“Trying awful life hacks” Finds a hack that works perfectly
#1 on trending! congrats danny
So…the tape break only works if your wrists are bound normally, but if they do a figure-8 wrap that won’t work. One of the best ways to escape from that kind of wrap is to reach down and remove a shoelace from your shoe. Tie a loop around each end and hook them onto the front of your shoes, with the center of the lace around the back of the tape between your hands. Then just start peddling back and forth, the friction heating up the tape and melting it easily. It’s apparently what Navy Seals are taught to escape bindings.
Why am I not seeing more comments about Nick fucking man handling Danny with that scarf 🤣
Its finally happened, the main character has the same name as me 💔😩
I’ve gotta say, I really appreciate Danny renting out a whole-ass garage simply for “ambience”
why didnt she just stand up and walk out WITHOUT melting her "handcuffs"?
Lemme just say that first girl would never be at risk for a kidnapping. Even with multiple men it would be hard for her to be forced to do anything simply for how short yet fat she is.
If youre getting rear naked choked by someone there is nonway your reaching back and snapping their neck 🤣
7:18 dany
petition for nick to be in more videos ⬇️⬇️
#1 on trending nice
Damn Number one on trending . Good job danny
I love this! Also your amazement with the last hack😂
i love seeing nick and danny hanging out
that duct tape hack is well known within the escapism community. It's the most commonly known 'kidnapping hack'
Gosh, I'm glad I chose this one video that my kidnappers let me watch!
Was hoping to see some feet... but I guess not
Good job
that moment when danny’s life flashed before his eyes had me screaming
Nice #1 on trending
MISSED THESE VIDS SMMM
NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING LETS GOOOO DANNNYYY
Anyone else think Danny should review Zapped? Weird movie, I swear.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE TOE SOCKS
Renting a warehouse was 100% worth it
Biggest fear: Watching Danny in public and someone looks over at my phone while only troom troom clips are on and now think I watch weird kidnapper YouTube
#1 on trending :o
Arrivederci means until we meet again... i wonder if that means shes going to kidnap the kidnappers... revenge of the kidnapped kidnapper
haha Stockholm syndrom so funny
Hilarious
13:22
They can’t afford a new TV after having to buy that PS5 from a scalper. Understandable.
#1 trending! Let’s go GREG
My step dad tried to show me that duct tape one years ago and brought it down right on his knee instead of just down and he broke his arm 😹😹😹
1 0n trending h0w
this is the funniest one you’ve ever made, the titanic one is a close second but boy oh boy did i laugh
#1 on trending
jokes aside, i can't fucking believe troom troom thought this would be an ok video idea. troom troom, being originated in Ukraine, must be well aware of the horrible case from Russia that was widely discussed like less than half a year ago - Skopinsky maniac ("Скопинский маньяк" in russian) kidnapped two teenage girls and trapped them in the bunker for 4 years in the 00's. they escaped, he was imprisoned, but this year this fucking monster was released yearly for his "good behavior", and you know what he did first? he promised to kill these girls, to finish what he started, and our law enforcement system basically gave no shit. everyone from CIS heard this story, everyone was discussing it, because its truly horrendous stuff. and all of that for troom troom to make a fucking goofy videos making fun of the situation like this
10:05 This has got to be the goofiest thing I have ever seen
honestly might be my favorite video of yours yet i couldn't stop laughing
I saw Danny age 10 years right before my eyes the moment he choked on that black fuzz
1# Trending congrats!
This video absolutely slaps
dang number 1 on trending
Ngl, nearly pissed my pants during the crafting corner part there.
Troom Troom is short for Truly Traumatizing
#1 on trending? Ok, king, go off
good  job its #1 trending
Someone tell Danny he made a gimp mask
My car has a manual seat,  it might work
Your camera man going hhhmmm after you ripped the tape is so fucking funny
I don't know how many people have said this already, but I fucking hate the narrator's voice.
15:06 Jewish people be like
I like the hair, Dan
I like Nick. Bring him back :)
Good video good video
The sexual tension between Nick and Danny is unmeasurable
can we talk how her shoes went on and off
It was very attractive when you did that wink😳😳
#1 on trending moment
For free?
I am so confused
Troom troom is just a parallel universe and these videos are not click bait, low effort engagement content for 5 year olds, they are documentaries.
O'Boy 😮! I sure do hope, no kidnappers watch this video 😏. Would be a total bomber if they know all the tricks the next time I kidnap someone. I'm pretty sure the victims will be impressed that we watched the same video and we lowkey can bond over our love for Troom-Troom.. Idk 🤷‍♂️ kinda quirky
"okay, now let's try to get him to commit tax fraud" -- the troom troom writers, probably
Fun Fact: Survivor Holly Dunn was able to escape serial killer Angel Resendiz by using her quick wits and being an overall bad bitch. One of things she did was when he went to gag her she stuck out her tongue out as far and stiff as she could, that way when she relaxed ,she was able to maneuver the fabric it over her face and fell to around her neck. I was reminded of this by the being tied up “hack” and felt like I should share it, who knows, could save someone one day.
the "build-a-sim" soundtrack playing relentlessly at the beginning is driving me insane
Crying
By.i9’
Fantastic work. So romantic.
Congrats on 1 on trending!
Jesus is your free gift to heaven when you believe in his death, burial and resurrection you are immediately saved.

That gas canister in the background of the bit with you and nick isn't properly chained up, I'm telling OSHA
Imagine where you have to be in your life to play one of the kidnappers in this
nickisnotkidnapper
Among us
The tape one is actually real, your supposed to swing your hands back through your body as hard as you can( from front to back) and it breaks
Why did I think this was gonna be tips on how to kidnap
Why did Danny look 12 in the scarf? 🤣
he looks like a wizard with that scarf
sims 3 music
Ah yes let me just adjust the seat back-  *five minutes later*  Oh… I forgot that it’s automatic…
Nick: “God he looks good. I love when he wears that scarf.” Danny: *walks gracefully as if the scarf is leading him to his destiny*   I’ve replayed that part 4 times now I can’t stop laughing at the edit
#1 on trending! Good job 👍!
The next time I kidnap someone I got to make sure I use more than 3 layers of scotch tape on their wrists. Thanks for the advice Danny!
Let’s go Brandon!
“Are you tied up with scotch tape?” “No-“ “pErFeCt!”
I’ve been blessed with this 30 minute video. Thank you Danny
This was the funniest video I’ve seen in awhile please make more
Oh my god, the narrator's voice is fucking UNBEARABLE.
That was the most horrible Italian accent I have ever heard. Dear God my Italian teacher would go mental.
I love how this guy gets #1 on trending bro he is worth #1
😂😂😂
16:25 IM DEAD 💀 🤣
Getting Elsagate vibes from TroomTroom
#1 on trending I’m so proud
Why did they change the narrator's voice it sounds so much worse now
Saddened that they don't know how matches work. :p
Dan Dan gets kidnapped, man! 😬
Okay
Sensei Seth appreciates
7:59 Every car in USA has a little glow in the dark handle in the trunk so you can open it from inside.
Idk why but the square knot joke is the funniest thing to me
#1 on trending!
Why in the second video did the criminal sniff the chane
The fact that all the girls knew what's up with the duct tape thing and Danny had no idea...lol stay safe ladies!
is that a fricking jojo reference? "Arrivederci"
Greg 👕
You actually can get out of being tied up by tensing all of your muscles (maybe not necessarily holding your breath too lol). It's not as dramatic as troomtroom made it look, but it does create extra space when you relax and you can maneuver your way out
Nice trending lol
truly troomautising
Damn #1 on trending 👏👏👏
"I love when he wears that scarf🥰💗"
#1 on trending
Congrats on #1
YOOOOO #1 ON TRENDING!!!
9:27 Danny I’m not sure a video about kidnapping is very light-hearted
Am I the only one who thought Nick was Wilbur Soot at the start 😂
1's ON TRENDING congrats

Danny is gonna die in one of these
Going on the trending page is like looking at cringy photoshopped thumbnails. And then just Danny with the #1 spot. I love it
"Guns don't kill people, criminals kill people. And *criminals are guns.* " I lost it 😂🤣🤣💀
Can they make a how to kidnap people life hacks asking for a friends
damn Danny, I just realized that you have really nice hair.
arivaduci, means bye in Italian! they pronounce  it wrong.
Are we gonna ignore the fact that those bandits have a life-sized naked doll in the corner??- 👁👄👁
21:48 w-was that a wink 😳
I will forever miss the original troom troom captionist from Danny’s first vid. :( so many fun emotes
Can you please move the cue cards closer to your camera so that we don’t have to see you reading your cue cards that is so stressing my OCD out
Danny, TELL ME this isn't BACKGROUND MUSIC FROM THE SIMS playing at the beggining??
Hi this is a good video.
Ofc Danny is #1 on trending
I feel that other you tubers wouldn't have got this extreme for troom troom,                       But not Danny!
The last test they did with the Scotch tape was the only one that actually works
hello nick
I love how Nicks and Dannys kidnapping thing turned i to the kidnapper coaching the victim on how to survive
Congrats on trending! Seriously, wow!!!
Congrats on being #1 on trending!
I am licherally crying this is so funny
"Are you tied up with scotch tape? Perfect!"
What a whale. Lets kill kill it
13:05 man the new Batman movie looks great!
CONGRATS ON 1# ON TRENDING
the voiceover growls get me
This video is so chaotic lol
Most trunks have a lever that when pulled will open the trunk and call authorities and I don’t think there’s a single way you can be tied to not be able to trickle around and pull it
Nick looks like he would a contestant on total drama
did not expect that last one to work
i really did not expect the duct tape one to work
“ ❤️ are you being strangled? :D 😍😉”
Guns don't kill people! Nuh-uh. _I_ kill people. With guns.
The crafting scene had me dying!
I watched this video twice in one night. Absolutely hilarious!
nick genuinely choking danny holy shit hahaha
mickey mouse has turned a new leaf

Why is the narrator Mickey Mouse
Your #1 on trending!!!
I immediately tried the tuft tape break thing. It worked on first try! I feel powerful now, .. come at me kidnappers and kinky people unprepared to have the tables turned!
Me, When someone asks me how circumcision works: 15:13
Thats why you cut out their eyes first.
Oh my god I was terrified of the duct tape snapping Danny's wrists to pieces
I don't like how the wrods "QUICK! QUICK! THROW HER IN THE TRUNK!" just blasted out my phone in public
troom troom really gave a tutorial on how to snap someones neck
y'all felt that... when he winked at the camera
The girl from the 2nd vid killed black she's kinda S U S
Nick carried this video
Better idea, prevent kidnapping & don’t condone the wrong thing again.
12:00

Not to be rude or anything but Danny Gonzalez can try kidnapping hacks on me any day
You guys have a rlly funny dynamic
Honestly, duct tape tears pretty easily. if it weren't for the fact scotch tape doesn't stick as well as duct tape, I would actually think scotch would be harder to get free from.
10:19 “how much force I would have to throw it back and crush them”  Considering it’s you Danny, you won’t need much force throwing it back to crush them
I wish I knew this Nick person earlier, he is also hilarious

NICE! #1 ON TRENDING
How come the most stupid of the hacks work
Real Ziptie hacks btw: Depending on the strength of the ties, the strands and/or the locking mechanisms tend to be weak on their own, you can break the loose parts of the cord to get into the mechanism with your fingernail, or twist your wrists until the locking part breaks off.  If they are too strong for and they get daisy-chained like that, use the loose strand off one wrists tie and work it into the middle lock to hold the tab back. You'd have to play with the outer strand of the middle tie too as you cram the other in there.
Oh wow #1 on trending
As a professional kidnapper, I can tell you these hacks are horrible!
A dungeon? Kinky😏
How am I supposed to know the video is over if you don't tell me at the end of it?

8:36 did he sniff the chain? 😂
11:19 If duct tape was used in the Vietnam war to patch bullet holes in helicopter blades I'm pretty sure it's stronger than that.
i’m sorry but the sims 3 music in the background is truly elevating this experience
I stayed here for hours because there is no outro. How was I supposed to know that the video was over now and I had to find something else to watch?
Nicksnotgreen is an extremely talented musician!! Y’all should check out the songs he’s made, they’re in his channel and they’re amazing. He also had a different channel called Denton which has some great songs too!

Nick wearing his glasses over the mask Is my favourite part 🤪
As a kidnapper I feel appreciated
The troom troom videos have some strange sexual undertones
29:02 gives me the energy of when the heroes "Capture" the main villain, but the villain hasn't even reached their final form
Wow. Those "life hacks" are some truly tasteless and irresponsible content, and it's clearly being marketed towards kids.
Arriverdirchi means goodbye in Italian

They somehow traded the bad narrator for an even worse narrator… how?
Troom troom gives me terror toon vibes
The duck tape one is just a military tactic

3:08 IS ANYONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE TOE SOCKS?!?
Here’s a real life hack. Usually, if your kidnapper is masked, they’re planning on ransoming you, and you should do as they say. If they aren’t masked, they are probably going to kill you, so do everything in your power to escape and fight back.
I thought this video was about life hack doe kidnapping someone else. I now realise life hacks for escaping kidnappings makes more sense.

Yo I was a troom troom  joiner from 3.4 m just when you exploded in 123 go ayy
While looking at Danny wearing his ski mask I could only see Griffith
Wait nick is tall?
27:57 fun fact I already knew it would work because there's a guy on tic tok who reads an escape a kidnapping book by the military
How comes there's no ft or w/ nickisnotgreen in the title?
Ok but the breathing thing is what horses do when you try and saddle them. You have to recheck the saddle like 5-10min later after they've stopped holding air to re-tighten it
ok but duck tape is easy to escape just pull and twist your arms a bunch and it should loosen enough to escape
13:54 this implies danny would still show his toes in exchange for money
Why does the voice sound like the girl from squid game saying green light.
The narrator is Minnie Mouse
Troom troom is probably the kidnapper trying to make you loose more brain cells when THEY kidnap you

“He’s in love with her.” Followed by the masked thug recapturing his victim and throwing he onto a bed was super unsettling. For a second I thought five minute crafts was going to suddenly descend into graphic sexual violence.

Does anyone feel like he is sponsored every video?

Every single trying troom trooms hack videos always end up being hilarious even nick came out Istg YouTube been goin crazy recommending me his videos 😂😂
arrivederci means until we meat again
I let the video play all the way to the end because I care about you.
Why does the narrator’s voice sound like a rlly bad impersonation if micky mouse 💀
Your tan line on your face is so distracting.
I’m sorry but I really really despise the first girls voice, it’s so much more annoying then the second girls 😭

I'm convinced these skits are just weird sexual roleplay for the actors. Troom squared is a fetish site for Mr Roger's fans.

#1 on trending congrats!
I like how all of the things that can irritate me the most about these videos, the thing that irks me the most is the names the narrator gives to these NOTHING characters
Gen z is the worst creation ever… go back to where y’all came from. :)
I heard they were terrible I saw some, and as they weren’t the best it walls wasn’t horrible But this for sure is I understand now XD
I hate the narrator’s voice so much, it sounds so condescending and WAY too high pitched!
This was so good, I always love Danny’s commentary but his banter with Nick is golden too
Don’t get me wrong the hacks were trash but some people do fall in love with captors.
Honestly thought it was going to be a compilation of Danny kidnapping people off the street with different "life hacks."
Number 1 let’s gooo
Imagine being kidnapped and being like “ hold up I gotta watch troom troom real quick” and watching it while being kidnapped
Even if they did work I’m not going to remember this crap when I’m getting kidnapped
8,000+ comments so I'm sure someone else has pointed out . . . . that girl in the zip ties.  Why did she have to go through all the trouble of burning her way out of the zip ties when the cell was unlocked?  She could have just walked out still wearing the zip ties.
the most concerning thing about this is that there was just a random ass alexa in the room
Guns don't kill people criminals kill people Was actually a pretty good line xD
I don’t know why but when I saw the title I thought it was how to do the crime My mind makes me very uncomfortable
5:00 you mean the people who kidnapped her, Are a bunch of criminals?
Why did they change the voice though like do they actually want people watching their videos lol
ok but i lowkey want dannys sweatshirt lol
Was Kurtis filming this?
What with every kidnapping video thinking kidnappers use zip ties for kidnapping e.e like why???? Who would use that why would they use that lol
The fact that they did the things that would actually work wrong 😑
9:07 that mannequin in the back be like
Danny asking Alexa a question triggered my Alexa and she gave me the definition for virtue lmfao

Did that bandit... sniff the chains?
27:03 .........no...
anyone have some real tips? like, resources - foundations and stuff. i think it's be good to have some in the comment section here
8:39 This reminds me of something I heard while listening to a true crime case some time ago, I sadly don't remember which.. A girl was being kidnapped and blindfolded and puffed up her face as she was being blindfolded by the kidnapper which allowed her to see through the small gap created when she relaxed her face, she observed her surroundings in the car (I mean the seats, floor etc.) and even the type of sounds and movements the car made which made it way easier to track down the kidnapper when she got free. Just an interesting fact, thought I would share. :)
29:44 bruh, imma be 100 percent honest with you, when he threw his phone on the ground I jumped and I don't know why
Why is no one talking about the duct tape actually breaking by using the hack?! I got so excited seeing that😆
Danny and Nick need to do more videos together. This was awesome 😂
The ski mask crafting section made me cry with laughter
You are number 1 on trending if you didn't know which you probably do
15:40 it took kids at a sweat shop to get a nice scarf like that
The people in those scenarios who bought the Kidnappers stuff must have a light case of Stockholm.
I dont know why its called kidnapping, Ive never got one of those little bastards to fall asleep

"Welcome to the crafting corner." Danny I am sorry to break the news to you (Not from the news corner) however that is indeed not a corner.
You can get two things from the title how to kidnap someone or how to get free from a kidnapping
All the time you were doing the match thing, before you struck the match, I  was thinking that I bet you bought the wrong kind of matches, and you did. There are matches that require something like the strip on the side of the box to light, often called safety matches, or strike on box matches and there are matches that just require a rough surface like rock (or concrete blocks) to work and you'll often see them for sale with camping or outdoor equipment, called strike anywhere.  They probably used strike anywhere matches, they come in green now which those were and she had a short strike.  You can light strike on box matches without the strip, which causes a chemical reaction to happen, but you need to strike it a long distance and the right surface.
Congrats on #1 tending man! You deserve it

Fun Fact: Danny Gonzalez (or Danny G) is a YouTuber famously from Birmingham
okay i'm sorry, but like why does the narrator sound like mickey mouse
No one:   Kidnapper Danny: Gimme your… self, I guess.
real talk: if someone grabs you like that, go for the eyes. ALWAYS go for the eyes when you're close enough to do so and if they're in front of you kick them between the legs (doesn't matter if it's a guy, it still hurts)
I literally cannot finish this episode, the narrators voice is too damn annoying. Its like listening to someone do a horrible Mickey Mouse impression.

Nick and Danny are now my favorite kidnapper and kidnape duo of all time
One of the original theories about Troom Troom was human trafficking so kidnapping videos is really sus
If only drew knew this when he was kidnapped by the pail brothers and taken to costal rica
"nickisnotgreen" is actually him trying to hide the fact he is a reptile
that was useful hacks, i have to write it down somewhere for the future if i ever get kidnapped!
Nick accidentally murdering Danny with the scarf
troom troom read 1D kindapping fanfics and thought it was how that works irl
Danny really upped the production quality for this one.
I’m sorry Danny, this is probably fairly petty and also meaningless to you, but I can’t finish this video. Troom Troom is so cringe every time you pay a piece of it in this video my soul aches a little more. I’ll drop a like for the algorithm gods for ya.
7:21 SHEESH
the fact that neither of them knew that you could snap duct tape off like that... as a girl i learned that in like 3rd grade "just in case"
"To be honest, kids are the only one who normally watch their videos ngl"   If the kidnappers don’t come back after 15 minutes, you’re legally allowed to leave.
“ im a straight lined criminal”
The duct tape (sorry, scotch tape) trick also works with a tie wrap! You should totally try it! (Although I think with the tie wrap you have to use your knee too? Not sure.) You should totally try other kidnapping hacks from other channels! And make it worth renting that basement 😂
Only way she’s getting kidnapped is with Starbucks and a box of Oreos
danny bring back the outro song,
not me watching this video while eating off of Nick’s old silverware 😳
Danny and Nick together = funny lol
Very bad. This never should exist. Kidfnaping is not a joke. Evan laughing at harming someone can kill your own .
Is there sims music in the beginning of this video??
0:23 hope you know this made me choke in the middle of the homophobia i was eating at
i do not like nick at at all tbh
If you inhaled and tensed up while being tied up, you would barely be able to breathe once you relax....
“Are you tied up with scotch tape? Perfect!!” Who and the hell writes and produces this nonsense?
Love when he does crafts
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
3:09 the fact that shes wearing toe socks rlly sums it up
my favourite thing is that nick is taller than danny and kurtis even though he’s just a small lanky boy
Aww! Daddy Nick, I want you to lock me up in a dungeon, tie me up with tape and choke me inside a car!
How to escape from the dungeon Step 1: Put leaves in your hair Step 2: Say your Billie Eilish and ask them to let you free Step 3: Go out
Troom Troom be like: How to escape from the kidnappers dungeon! Step 1: *Ask them to let you out* Step 2: Have a tea party with them and put leaves in your hair to look like Billie Eilish!
I love Kurtis's laugh in the background in the duct tape part
This video funny hahahaha x
Danny´s face when he is being tied up xDDDDDDD
Hey can you give me my phone so I can watch this video and learn how to escap? No. It's by the famous TroomTroom! Oh, ok! Then it's fine
I'm not into feet, but now that it's been pointed out that he's denying us, I kinda want to see them.
square knot is used to tie to ends of string together, tie the the left over the right, then the right over the left, pull strongly to create a square knot. push the ends together to release the knot.

“It smells like Walmart in here”. You wouldn’t think that has a smell, but it definitely does

Am I the only one noticing the narrator's a different person on the first vid?? Never knew I was gonna say this but I prefer the old narrator 💀  Edit: Oh thank god they have a different one on the rest of the videos
I think they found a refrigerator box and then wrote the video around that

Honestly, that ducttape thing is mind-blowing! :O
Wow Rupert Grints career really went downhill lately.
I love how the first video has the victim just having fun with the kidnappers and then the second video has the first hacks being the victim getting themselves out of being tied up with chains and snapping the kidnappers' necks.
Sims 3 music in the background 👍👍
Their videos are basically a guide to having stockholm syndrome.
why did the kidnappers put the girl in the dungeon but didn't lock it??? she just walked out. also all of the useful kidnapping hacks are literally just tips ive been hearing for years on end. they offer nothing new. and another thing: no one's going to ziptie you like that like literally ever. your wrists would be together with just one ziptie and you'd just end up burning your skin with the fire. you might be able to melt the plastic but it's thick and will probably get on your skin. i guess the burns are better than dying or God knows what the kidnappers will do with you tho? last complaint about this video: with the duct tape tip you're supposed to aim for your stomach idk what the troom troom lady is doing
DANNY THIS IS #2 ON TRENDING GOOD JOB👏👏
3:33 THOSE ARE HER FUCKING FEET
Damn Kurtis was shooting this video

The duck tape is true with zipties too

So hilarious and fun!!! Thank you Danny!
The try guys did a serious video like this where they told them real tips, the busting the ducttape and puffing out bigger while you're tied up were in it I think. It's a good video.
The duct tape trick works with those flexicuffs, I think going over your knee kinda helps too, if that makes sense.
I’m thinking the narrator is AI
Danny, hair looking good! 👌🏻
24:48 WHY DOES HE LOOK SO ADORABLE
Me and my sisters demonstrated the duct tape ripping at a talent show once lol
3:07 IS NOBODYD GOIGN TO TALK AVOUT HOW HER SOCKS HAVE TPES??
This was so goddamn funny, I never knew how much I missed irl collabs, plus I love nick  :)
Every aspect of troom troom makes me violently angry
11:10  Narrator: are you tied up with scotch tape? the girl: nods*  Narrator: PERFECT :D
When Danny said "and criminals are guns" for a moment i thought he was Sykunno
25:45 are you tied in scotch tape? PERFECT!
love all of Dannys content but the multiple-day multiple-location ones are so fucking funny. understand its a higher budget but I love them sm. can't wait for more!
where does this land on the nameless rating system
Narrator:It's obvious that he's in love with her Danny: Bad sign not good  Me : on the floor dying from laughter
LMAO i'm just imagining telling your partner "bye honey im off to work where i'm gonna pretend to be kidnapped/kidnapp someone for thousands of people to see
Maybe the narrator has been kidnapped, and these are just their fantasies about how they could've been freed, all that they're having while being mentally and physically tortured.
Holy shit. I was actually laughing so hard during the crafting of the toe sock lmao
why were you falling at the end the?
Is the narrator fucking mickey mouse
WHY AREN'T YOU BREATHING DANNY? YOU LOOK INSANE
3 videos in a MONTH!!! LETS GOOOOO!!
troom troom literally told children to play with matches im speechless
They have a Xbox but not a tv
They even broke the spawner in the dungeon. Absolute monsters.
OMG this was amazing!
11:22 yes it break so easily i doesnt even need to touch your leg the wind magically make it break
TroomTroom probably doesn’t use fabric glue because they could never figure out that they have to cut the tip off
I think an issue is that some of these "hacks" are very badly explained versions of genuinely helpful tips- the detailed explanations are key to why they work. LIke 27:23, pushing the elbows outwards is the key to breaking out of the tape, but those videos didn't even mention that. Then litter them amongst "hacks" that don't work, and it's just misinformation station.
Girl: arrivederci losers!!  Bucharrati: that’s my line?!
During the  stay put girl line milk came out my nose and went on the phone the table and the power cord
I just can’t watch this cringe
everyone knows danny doesn’t wear a case on his phone this ad is a lie
Help, let me go Help, let me go Help, let me go Stop kidnapping me!
“ I’m getting kidnapped ! ” * happy go run intro plays *
you can do the duct tape thing with zip ties too, just a fun little thing I would do w/ pals in scouts.
the “now i crush his bones” and nick looks down and scoots over IS MAKING ME LAUGH HYSTERICALLY HAHAH IVE STARTED THAT PART OVER LIKE 5 TIMES!!
I have spent my entire life online, and seen some horrible stuff, funny stuff, weird stuff, etcetera etc, but I do not know what the FUCK troom troom is.
That's not how matches work
Ooh Danny wink✨✨✨
Watching this in a safeguarding course. I’m not learning much about protecting vulnerable ppl but I’m learning lots about how to kidnap ppl. Ty Danny
If I ever hear that narrator again I’m going to become a gun just like the guys in the video
With my slow ass electric car seat it would take about 5 minutes to crush someone 😅 I think I'm dead
3:08 did anyone see the toes
I need a lot more of Danny's friend lol they are hilarious together
those socks with fingers are my nightmare
Aw... They're falling in love.
gotcha girlie!
His search history: does snapping someone's neck kill someone                             How to snap someone's neck                             What to do with dead kidnappers
lmao the ad before the video had the same music as the start of the video just a bit more turned down that is what I call a perfect segway.
7:50 wait this car look fimilar WAIT THATS MY OLD CAR well im georgian and trom trom are russians THATS WHY I HATE ok this has gone to far
Nobody gonna tell him he's sposed to slam his wrists against his knees to break the tape?
Hey Danny I know this video has nothing to do with Hallmark movies but I just want to thank you as well as Kurtis Conner for putting me onto that genre (I guess we can call it a genre right) Call it self harm but my new favourite pastime is watching these terrible movies and I have a lot of fun. Thank you
Am I gullible or did the duct tape thing work
"Arrivederci" literally means "see you soon"... shouldn't she say something akin to "addio"? which means roughly "goodbye to never be seen again"?
im gonna have my classmates duct tape me up and then im just gonna stare them down as i break it near effortlessly and walk away
Jeongguk is safe y’all
The tape one was insane... totally thought it was fake...
ArIvAdErChI LoSeRs
Whoever directs the voice actors for this must just be drilling into them "No! Every sentence needs to have that up inflection! Every sentence goes up! Always sound surprised!"
Still processing the phrase "how much force I would have to put into throwing it back to crush someone".
the narrator's voice is so strained... I hope she takes care of her vocal cords :c
The duct tape test actually blew my mind.
Am I the only one loving the background sims music that Danny plays 😌
6:47 Troom Troom, get your filthy paws away from my favorite video game Mortal Kombat.
I like how he is making more videos now
I should not have been drinking when Danny said "then I'll break my wrists...and I'll still be trapped" :D
yo why does the narrator sound like she belongs on baby bus
I saw Nick in the intro and started laughing way too hard
long story short, if you get kidnapped just get the kidnappers a tv and playstation as reward
The narrator's voice is worse now.... And i didnt know it was even possible
10:10
danny you keep putting sims music in the background of your videos and i think this means you now HAVE to stream you playing it.
Welcome to English class. Today we’ll be reviewing laws of English.  Yes = yes No = no Yeah no= no No yeah = yeah Yee = haw Criminal = gun
4:47 That's the scream from "Neighbours from hell" anyone else noticed it?
Danny could have just used his creepy basement instead of renting a garage
He said us
There were so many kinks present in this video.
Y E S!!!!!!
*Cries in I thought the kidnapper was going to be Kurtis Conner but he’s not*
16:32 and one of them did suicide and the criminals a so lazy they didn’t eveb care to put him away Oh no
"...for free for you sickos" Okay danny, where do I pay?
I can't imagine having to film that troom troom video. It's so ridiculous.
the craziest part of this, there's actual hacj´ks they chóuld have used that work.   like to break your zip ties... you can either use your shoelaces..... another is that you first tighten the ties so there's tension. then you slam them with a long arch on your hip. ..... basically the competent version of the tape one   you can look those up. they actually do work.
As far as I know you can‘t light watches on and surfaces anymore for safety reasons.
that is russia in real life!!!! :D
Guys, if you get kidnapped, and the kidnapper is gone for 10 minutes, you’re legally allowed to leave.
This is the most dorky thing I have ever seen, and I'm loving every second of it!
That’s why Troom Troom couldn’t use the fabric glue because they never realized they could cut it. Big brain Danny 😂
I still can’t believe the ducktape “hack” worked!
Somehow...somehow their videos became even more incomprehensible. You're a brave man for watching them, let alone trying them out.  Also, the reason why the car seat thing doesn't work is because you have a slow recliner. Older cars have a little lever you push and you immediately go flying backwards while breaking your neck at mach speed.
I feel like all troom troom videos are aimed at young kids playing pretend and giving them tips for their games Edit: Just kidding. I kept watching and "snap your kidnappers neck" is not advice you want to give to a kid playing pretend
15:14 my parents as soon as I was born
Bro. They need to be stopped.
I'm loving the fast uploads
I heard the phrase "catch 22" atleast 15 times today
Danny shows that trooms trooms kidnap life hack (the scotch tape)  The kidnapers: aight imma use chains then goodluck breaking those
I thought you just have your dad call them and say "I will find you, and I will kill you" and they think he's Liam Neeson, freak out and let you loose.
this video just made me realize how weak duct tape is
how do you look even younger than your last video?
"And now you've thrown them off their rhythm"
Bruh this dudes need a TV but the can afford a damn PS5! (There is the PS5 Pad to prove it...6:35)
Just so you know snapping necks does Kill
To be honest, when are they never awful
Hey how do you think those kidnappers got babies to put blacalavas on? 🤨
why does the narrator always sound like theres a gun being held to her head or sorry, i meant a _criminal_
I lost all my braincells now I lost my brain
you dont breathe in before you are tied up, how the hell did you even consider that hack plausible if that was how  you thought it worked?
Nick constantly trying to make Danny laugh while he’s trying to hold his breath
I know nobody asked but arrivederci means goodbye until we -arrive together- meet again
"But since when are criminals good at arts and crafts?" Ed Gein: hehe
if you get kidnapped, just leave. easy!
Actual hack, it is possible strike a match on glass (a window for example) so like idk if the thingy on the box is all scratched off and doesn't work and you're somewhere with a window, you can still light the match.
MORE VIDS WITH NICK! <3
Wow🙋🙋🙋☺☺☺☺😀😁😂😃
them not only using zipties but pulling them skin tight physically hurt me why oh why would you do that
Why do the kidnappers sound like mickey mouse
I wasn’t ever really wondering what your feet looked like Never was But now I’m kinda curious 😶
Plot twist: the camera person is actually a kidnappee, and danny is taunting them by showing them all the ways they could escape, but can't because danny knows about them
God damn this content is killer. Love you boys, make sure you get home in time for dinner.
Hey!  It's nick is green!
How did you not mention the fact the girl sounded like baby jay from that candy ken vid 🤣 😭
🪢
13:20 He looks like Griffith from berserk
The dry "ahh he's back" dude Danny is fucking hilarious
Damn daniel you really got outta them situations
Ariva derchi
Unironically, Danny genuinely does look good in that scarf
the fucking sims music lmao
scotch tape is also a mistranslation, in russian (and i guess ukranian too) we call every tape "scotch"
The tape one actually works if it's a ziptie. Just raise your arms, aim for your upper hips, and swing towards yourself and the ziptie will break. Not with tape though. I've tried it, it doesn't work.  EDIT: Oh hey, it does work. Neat. Guess I was just doing it wrong.
This entire channel has to he satire
Nick struggling with the mask is the greatest thing ever
Oh my god the voiceover girl is making my ears bleed
These aren't kidnap escaping hacks, they're kidnapping hacks
Soo… they got a ps5 and a house… but not a tv…
The funniest part of this is that Danny has Alexa in his kidnapping dungeon
Ok someone’s gotta say it. you are glowing in this vid sis
hello
DANNY POSTED YAY
at first I thought they were life hacks to help you kidnap people easier
Gotcha girly
superfunny video thanks for the laughs !! XD
Why does Nick sound so annoyed😂
My parents could not have walked by at worse times
R2 seems like he’s surveying the kidnapping
what happened to the old narrator? ima make a petition to get this narrators vocal chords removed
Did you frost your tips? You are looking on fleek!!!
It sounds like the narrator is the one who's been kidnapped
If your being strangled, just fucking snap  his neck :D /j
OBSESSED WITH THIS DUO
Anyone else want to go find duct tape and try this now?
Damn Danny a million views in 15 hours!!!
danny my favorite goofball 🥺🥺🤪🤪🤪
Kidnappers watching this right now like: Oh sh*t never doing these ones again
stealing crap content is still stealing, try making your own instead of debunking a video so stupid anyone who needs it debunking deserves to be kidnaped
at 8:09 was i the only one with a glitch
You can’t just snap someone’s neck that takes a lot of force
Why does the narrators voice kinda sound like Candy Kens girlfriend
But ur still tied up ohhh
9:40  It's not enough to snap the neck, it's just a wrench that does some damage and inflicts a good amount of pain
React to sml
the sims 3 music in the bg omggggg.
nick helping out small creators very nice
that narrator’s voice is even more annoying than that tiktok text to speech voice
this shit is gold
Correct me if I'm wrong but the duct tape hack is actually used for zip ties (for anyone who wants to know you tighten the zip tie as much as you can then swing your arm down from above your head)
Okay but can we just talk about the sims music in the back 😩
"since when are criminals good at arts and crafts" hitler, since hitler
danny looks pretty good in a scarf
Is nobody going to acknowledge the mannequin in the troom troom video ( I think it was like 9 ish minutes in)
I've seen the duct tape hack everywhere
I honestly dont understand. Are kids into playing criminals? I saw some bored panda videos on how to sneak things into prison. Why are kids watching them?
Danny’s new hair style looks like Uncle Ned from 17 Again with Zac Efron
The "are you being strangled"  questions make me think there's some poor sod genuinely search YouTube for a way to escape whilst being strangled
ok how has the narration voice gotten even worse, like it's high pitched to the point where i can't even fully understand what she's saying half the time? and it feels genuinely physically uncomfortable for my ears to listen to it? this is true horror
Omg nooo I hate this. Not you Danny. You’re great but this.. no I hate this. Again Danny, I love the video. It’s awesome. But I got anxiety every other 30 seconds when it wasn’t your face.
3:09 what king of socks are those 💀
This is it. The perfect YouTube video
Guns don’t kill people; Bullets do. Guns just make them go really fast.
when nick just scooting over in the car when danny starting moving backwards is absolutely killing me. he was like “oop”  side note that hack is SUCH a bad idea because it brings you way closer to the attacker and they can just grab you with their hands or if they have a knife, stab you
Are we going to talk about the toe socks or no?
Danny is evolving and I’m here for it (as long as he still throws some commentary videos on shit movies every now and again)
nick and danny forbiddin lovers
this was.. increasingly hilarious. great video.
Holy shit, that narrator's voice makes my ears bleed. Make her stop. 😖
I hate how TroomTroom keeps saying "Arrivederci" (Italian formal and informal way of saying bye) but they butcher it *every time*
Plot twist: This is a kidnapper POV
that chain is the least tight thing i have ever seen
Did anyone else see the practice dummy in the backround for tying her up? There practicing tying her up
the title of this video should have been I got kidnapped by troom troom
Aight people Danny didn't show us his feet (I like hands more tho) but at least we know that he has nice skin. For a youtuber. 🌚
im sorry sometimes i watch these and wonder if danny is being dumb on purpose like when he was first trying to get out of the duct tape
19:47 he has got like a long thing. Very poor choice of words
What happened to Gamezalez Danny?
12:45 I'll just cut me a mouth face
You're the only YouTuber I've ever seen actually get out of the duct tape that way 😯😯 op op.. sorry.. scotch tape.
This video is pure chaos.
These are so wrong, omg
So… they are saying you should develop stockholm syndrome!?
Tesla
Danny is the biggest king ever
When Danny makes a video he makes it literally better than others😂
in elementary school some friends and I used to do the duct tape thing!! it actually works somehow
Nick is such a mood 😂
Why is Drew being replaced :(
Fuck off the duct tape one can't actually work. It must be a joke
This is beyond bizarre... I mean wtf were these people thinking!? Isn’t this a kids channel?
The Sims 3 music at the beginning got me sad, I love that game so much
now this is one of my favourite videos
This was hilarious best 30mins of my life
I literally had to stop watching this while I was getting ready for work bc I was laughing too hard and it was messing up my makeup. it was so bad...its amazing.
Nick wearing that ski mask makes this video 1,000,000,000 times funnier!
danny playing sims music in the bg tripped me out i thought i had the sims 3 build and buy open in the bg or something
I like ur shoes Danny
The way that he hold his breath killed me
Bro, i cant with these videos, straight crack up Danny, ur literally the homie cuz
"And criminals are guns" is just too funny
this is the funniest video i’ve seen in so long
Safety matches won’t light on anything that isn’t the match box side. That’s the whole point of safety matches.
i love how the criminals home decor is like weapons   imagine if you walked into a plumber’s house and their home decor was like toilet bowls and pipes and shit
Man, I wish Danny said "arrivederci, losers" instead of "bye". Also, we wish to have a spooky encore to end the spooky saga
Yes drew yes it does kill people
13:31 possibly worst than that Ned Flames from tiktok social experiment
I love how unhinged Nick looks with the mask on, because honestly, relatable
The best way to be, ie the best possible thing you could be doing at any given moment is trying troom troom kidnapper life hacks.
I'm pretty sure the duct tape thing works no matter how many layers you use but I could be wrong
There's like a C-3PO in that garage.  Dang.
THE TOE SOOOOOOCCCKKKKKKSSSSSSS AHHHHHHHHHHHH
All car trunks have a lever that opens the trunk in them. Also yes, breaking people’s necks does kill them.
(As a beanie owner/lover, watching you cut it hurt me)  The video: Straighten yourself Me: *nervous bi sweating*
YES THIS IS BACK
Oh, I have the same glasses
this video was the definition of hilarious
Secondly.. if you're kidnapped in a dungeon.. just get out of the dungeon :/
troom troom never disappoints and lives up to their name: making unnecessary and useless videos to potentially crush your kidnap person legs
The "scotch" tape hack works because duct tape is literally made to rip that cleanly. I just rip it off the roll whenever I use it, I only use scissors when I need lots of pieces and want to protect my hands. It's made that way so you can use it quickly and easily without having to fumble around with scissors.  The breathing-while-being-tied also works, as you showed. In the video, she was tied to a column or something like that, so standing up wouldn't have helped her.
Where is the outro song? It is the only reason i watched the video
the narrator is mickey mouse now. i didn’t think i would ever say this, but i like the old one better
For free???? No just don’t show them
If locked in the trunk of a car, break trough the taillights. If that is not possible, tear out the wires from them to increase the possibility of cops pulling the car over. Turn on your location, send a message to everyone in your contacts, that is the simple solution. Zipties can be cut trough with your shoelaces. Grab your phone as you would a knife before stabbing and aim for temples - if done corectly, you can kill the attacker that way. Never stay fighting, if you kick a guy in his balls, turn around and run, don't try to knock him out completely.
You can't even light regular matches on anything other than it's box, that's why they're called safety matches, so that hack could've been debunked pretty easily without needing to make a toe sock.
LIKE HELP, LEMME GO, HELP, LEMME GO, HELP LET ME GO, LET ME GO TONIGHT   YOU'LL SCREAM HELP, LET ME GO, HELP LET ME GO, HELP, LET ME GO, STOP KIDNAPPING ME
"I just need a friend to tie me up." Is the start to all great story's.

ngl the sims music in the background really sent me back to me sitting in my room for hours staring at a screen.
First off, Danny is looking clean and fine today
If I go kidnapped I would just have the pornhub intro at 200% volume with bass at 100%
Why does the narrator sound like a high mickey mouse
The duck tape hack works with zip ties too!
24:32 is literally me when i need to go in the street but I'm in my pjs and grab the nearest dupatta
Danny: Doesn't know what arrivederci means. Jojo's fans: >:)
I knew the ducttape, sorry scotchtape one would work cuz Ive seen it somewhere else before but hearing it from troom troom first I also wouldnt believe it that something made specifically to not tear would break like that
The gifts the former captives give are probably mentioned so they're tax deductible haha
Gen Z be like-
At 11:34 You need to bring it down to your sides and do it a few times if you’re weaker, but yes this works.
24:30 Looks like he's wearing a cape lol
This video had me laughing so hard, and I'm Asian, so every time I laughed, my eyes would close to the point I had to pause the video because I couldn't see and I didn't wanna miss anything
still waiting for this year's  spooky october song
Great job, Martin! That’s a  f e l o n y !
i throwed up because i laughed too much
Just a couple of besties...kidnapping each other.
Wait a minute is that a real gun?
don’t cry, craft.
I just wanna ask the narrator if she tried these hacks while Troom Troom kidnapped her? Did it work, girlll!!??
A video I never thought I would see... Glad I did.
Next Danny is gonna review troom trooms free fun ways to die
"How much force I would have to put into throwing it back to crush someone"  -Danny Gonzalez, 2021, 10:17
24:35 anyone know the sound? Sounds familiar to me
“How much force I would have to put into throwing it back” - Danny, 2021
But the question we all need to know is, Did he know the Alexa was there?
danny looks cute af
Drew why are you wearing thongs on face?
Ok i am realy impresed with anyone who was able to wach it while with her saying it all in such a pich hight voice as if we all were less than 2 hers old.
Give me yourself ! - Danny, professional kidnapper 😂
I'm sure this was a great video but I couldn't get past 7 minutes, the narrator's voice gave me a headache
"oh god get out of my throat" ;)))
Aaa man that was so damn funnyy
The worst situation to be in is being born in america going to collage getting a loan going bankrupt due to dept and then you get hit by a car and forcefully taken to a hospital but due to no money you have no insurance
Sup Greg!
today my sister told me she's pregnant and i watched danny pick up matches with his toes
That narrator voice is giving me ear cancer
OH NO IM FINDING DANNY CUTE THATS ILLEGAL STOP
The way the narrator talks in that video got annoying really quickly
This is the funniest video you've done so far, Danny!
Ok.
Bro the sims 3 music is nostalgic
The duct tape one. You know, when someone gonna tied someone up using duct tape, It not gonna be just 3 layers, right? I worst I have seen it use is, not only the wrist but *the whole pair of hands* are covered in duct tape. It just a ball of duct tape at that point. I don't think someone could get out of that, normally...
.
My friend kill kidnapper with criminals, its just sad that he dies because of ligma
They suck at life hacks but their art is good
🎶"Guns don't kill people... ROBBERS DO!"🎶 5:37
So they were… kid nappers… since birth. Like… like kids napping. Because they’re babies. Napping.
The fact i got a bad game ad on dannys video
the first narrator sounds like she’s trying to do the worst Nikola Orsinov impression
nice sims music in the back
Man Stocholm Syndrome hit these people like within the first ten minutes.
Mr Ballen tried the tape trick… and almost broke his arms 😆
If the creator ls If this just admitted to this being comedy they would be kings...... Big Cringe has all the power already.
danny's eyes look swollen when he did his outro
That was perfection
stockholm syndrome confirmed
Yo mama gae
song name? 2:05
Is Danny a superhero he has a mask shape thing on his face
THE MOUTH HOLE ON THE MASK HAHA
If you have the scarf, they won't grab your shirt neck, and you can always get away
Yes snapping someone's neck will kill them
Nick + Danny = Magic
why do they keep saying arrivederci😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 so dead!
@Kurtis  are you filming this video??!!???
The "put the seat back and CRUSH HIM" had me dieing
I feel like danny is micheal and nick is dwight from the office
Funny thing, it's actually incredibly hard to break someones neck, which is why people are dropped several feet when they're executed by hanging.   YOu'd be much better off trying to gouge their eyes out fot your thumbs. THe pain would incapacitate them and they'd be unable to follow you on account of being blind.
This is some wattpad type shit
2:43 lmao tf is that skeleton doin' ?
did anyone else notice the sims 3 music?
Damn, Manbeast got Danny with the brbrbrbr.
This would actually be pretty plausible if it was Mr.Beast who was kidnapped…
"gotch'ya girlie!" will be in my nightmares
Omg I need "Great job Martin, that's a felony!" memes THIS INSTANT
nice frog shirt Danny
Ahhh Danny I love you can you post your yearly Halloween song I’ve been waiting so patiently..
The 381 people who disliked this are ether kidnappers or troom troom
"GIVE ME YOUR...self"
Yo Danny you can literally just buy a ski mask wtf 😂
my god this video is so funny danny you mastermind
i think Kurtis Conner is the cameraman lol
"Hey, that's the best way to be though!" is one of those moments where the words just come out wrong and you hope the other person doesn't notice.
ngl, the narrator sounds like they are being held at gun point. even their voice cracks can’t save them
sims music
Oh gawd!!!....this was hilarious (lmao)
dude when i first saw the title i thought it was hacks on kidnapping people lmao
this is my type
12:26  oh my gaaawd. Kim kardashian!!!
The kidnappers don’t have a TV and demands a random.. they have a GOD DAMN PLAYSTATION 5 CONTROLLER. (Edit: I posted this while watching so I didn’t see the part where they got the PS5, order of events matter lol)  Love your videos Danny, thank you lol.
The frustration of danny not getting the last one at first knowing its a legit thing was immense lol. Apparently it works with zip ties as well
the breaking neck is a real thing to do in such a situation it should be ruled self defence
Danny looks and sounds like a kid on Christmas Day when he breaks the duct tape.  Timestamps:  27:43 28:15 29:02 29:13
Danny is too weak for these hacks
Fun fact: I had read that hack/scenario of being tied up in a detective novel that was published in 1920's
The duct tape trick worked I’m so shocked I wonder if a woman would be strong enough to do it too
Arrivederci means goodby in italian,
I don’t feel a lot of on screen chemistry between Danny and Nick although I like them both separately, it just came across awkward. Still a fun video tho :)
i lost everything in the car bit  hahahahhshshwh
" are you okay? " " im kidnapped, of course im not okay. im scared. " *wink*
Nick is cute
The irl kidnapping testing was the most hilarious thing I've seen today
Im cryin. Danny out here stuggling with fabric glue when he just had to cut the tip off :P   Also gotta hand it to Danny for doing the Most in his videos
hold on in the 2nd hack did anybody notis the naked manican the the troom troom vid? the 1 with the chains
This is the best video ever
Yes danny you can kill someone by snapping their neck lol
im hyped for the epafting eopnep, its my new favourite danny video location.
The thing is, Danny really had a guest but Nick is just the red herring. R2D2 was the real guest.
finally, now i can kidnap people better... oh, surviving...? finally, now i can survive better, i guess
nice ps5 product placement troom troom...
great video my man, keep pumpin this shit out for me, it’s the only thing that’s stopping me from ending it all
1:25 bruh that girl so dumb she doesn't even realize that's the most dumbest trap in the world and she gonna be kidnapped
*e*
"The kinda knot you tie you fuckin' square" 🤣🤣🤣 I haven't laughed so hard
Ellen
i thought nick was kurtis
This is amazing. S tier Danny
The scarf get away hack was specifically created by troom troom for onlychristiantye to get out of a bad situation
is that sims 3 music i hear?
Nice joke
im cryinggg this is so funny
is drew filming?
Yay danny and troom troom rivalry is finally back. My favourite series.
Why on earth does the first narrator's voice sound like Paimon from genshin impact
I have no idea how this guy is able to still make stupid videos  Mankind needs to stand up against unnecessary videotic cringe
These victims are enjoying the kidnapping way too much
Omg Nick choking Danny gives people too much fuel for some fanfiction lmao
the only reason the duck tape one works was because it’s not one troom troom came up with. i remember being like 7 years old and trying that one in like. 2011
From now on I will only wear toe socks just to be sure. You never know when you get kidnapped, your hands will be tied in front of you with zip ties, get put in a dungeon of which the door isn't locked, your kidnapper is a freaking idiot who probably is a pyromaniac which means you can easily pick up one of his discarded matches 🤷🏻‍♀️
do i smell....stockholm syndrom?
2:11 this is actually good advice. like this is actually what they tell you to do in training. danny.
Nick and Danny are a perfect comedy duo
Who remembers Miss Gonzalez and her nephew
Nicks walmart shirt has a spanish flag in the back. Why?
12:45 this is a wabbery, put the coochie in the bag
I cannot stop laughing, thank you so much for this!!
That voice over is testing my patience
i almost threw up i was laughing so hard
You guys are so awkward together and I love it 😂😂😂
Watch the low budget, horrible animated movie: strawnsky and the mysterious house
You got nice skin... for a Youtuber
danny looks like a kid i went to middle school with its hard to believe his like 26
"There's always an Alexa"
the fact that these worked
What kind of sock is that 👁👁
Whenever I realize this was only 12 hrs ago. AHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The duct tape one was the most stupid sounding one but it actually worked
Danny, I'm disappointed! You forgot a crucial step in the life hacks. You're supposed to buy your kidnapper, Nick, a PlayStation, I can't believe you didn't do that. :(
“i felt like i was choking you for a while there”  “yeah you... were”
She literally could've just grabbed the match the entire toe sock "hack" was pointless
ahh hes back
DANNY lol. Duct tape is MEANT to tear easily. And it’s threaded. That’s why it tears cleanly. You don’t need scissors when you tear duct tape off the roll, you just rip it off. Why would you not think you could do the same when it’s off the roll? You can get out of zip ties with the same movement as well
'If you have a budget kidnapper' nick killed me 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly a great video, I don’t usually like stuff on YouTube but u and nickisnotgreen did a comedic job and it made me laugh a lot
Danny: Give the kidnappers everything they want and maybe they’ll let go of you 5 minutes later: exactly what happens in the video
did anyone else see the girl in the first vids toe socks, they pain me
Lesbian boy 😂
just to clarify, breaking someone's neck will not ensure instant death. in most cases, it breaks the vertebral segments, and there's a high likelihood that people will recover fully or end up quadriplegic.
I just cried in the bathroom for an hour while my boyfriend goes to bed unbothered and now I’m going to bed on the bathroom floor for 3 hours before work. Thanks for always being there Danny.
21:37 *Syndrome, Is that you..?*
lol the "Scotch tape" hack is an actual survival thing.
You have a lesbian haircut
The title is correct?
😂😂😂😂😂i actually cant
Cool
Nicki, Nicki Snot Green
Guns don't kill people! We're all impervious to bullets and it's a miracle!
wearing the scarf like a dupatta :)
Danny has literally chemistry with anyone.Kurtis,Nick,the other danny you name it.
Btw "arrivederci" in italian means "see you soon", until the next fun night with the kidnappers
We need more videos with tyler!!!🙌
i already hated the old narrator, but this one... they sound like they permanently have a peanut in their throat
This was so good!
I've never felt this much cringe watching a Troom Troom Video
Where is the outro song 😭
I'm trying to do tape lifehack, but it's doesn't work.
_Buy your kidnappers a fucking gift!_
the duct tape hack actually worked ???? i'm blown away???
the ending LOL
after all this time, he's trying troom troom stuff again. damm
im laughing incredibly hard right now
for the duck tape, it’s just glue so if you move your hands around the glue of the tape will eventually stop working! it hurts but it will be easier to slip away!
Troom troom's kidnapping video is a cinematic retelling of a quintessential wattpad story and you cannot convince me otherwise
“Lookin like a centaur” had me cryin 🤣
IF you get kidnapped, and are put in a room with guns that could be loaded, or a chain or literally anything else, or you escaped once and got caught in a really stupid manner, then you are the easiest target ever and likely wouldn't be worth much in the marketplace of ideas or the black market.
Bro im dying just by looking at the thumbnail 😂
fresh tshirt ngl
"arrivederci" is Italian for " until we meet again"
was that sims music in the video or did i imagine it?
❤️
Two dumbass youtubers trying out troom troom life hacks in a rented garage in Illinois is something that can actually be so personal…
Whos idea was it to fire the last va..?,As annoying as she is, At least she's better than this quiet highly pitched lady!
The first vid was just a plain Stockholm syndrome  presentation, lol.
Bc I didn't see anyone else comment this, yes the duct tape hack works, and there's also one to break it when it's on your ankles. Cross your feet over each other as best you can and then squat with your knees out, going down as quickly and forcefully as you can. Or if you have laces on your shoes, you can use them to saw through the tape. Just wanted to add that bc I learned it ages ago and I feel like it's a good tip for that type of situation. Even though you could probably just rip the tape off with your hands once you free them 😂
Actually the way you got out of the ductape seems to the the conventional advice for getting out of restraints, be that with ductape or zipties. Where did I lean about that? Achievement Hunter and Unus Annus. Also it's not so much taking a deep breath in for the rope thing, it's to brace yourself and make yourself bigger than you actually are, make them think that they tied you up real tight, but the reality is that once you relax, the rope is slack. I learned that one in clown school! :D
I’ve heard the last one works with zip ties too
21:40 Danny looks like he's powering up a super move
The "Get out if the car" _tip_ is basically "You're homeless..? Just buy a house!"
Danny: now i crush his bones Nick: politely scoots away
9:10 how is troom troom a kids Chanel 💀
Okay but now Troom Troom has to release a video on how to survive having to listen to their narrator for more than 2 seconds
We were making fun of Jungkook's toe socks but man is just prepared for abduction.
crafting corner? more like epafting eopnep
That's the best way to be
the sims 3 music at the beginning is absolutely sending me
Is the narrator on crack she has such a high voice
Goddamn those chains on the bedframe don't look good
This video  throom troom made is offensive
10/10
Ur deam
The main life hack I will be taking away from this is if I kidnap a woman she will become my best friend and buy me tvs and PS5s
Kidnapper Kevin looks a lot like 'CallMeKevin', fyi he's a youtuber
I feel like we were taught that duct tape thing in middle school PE. During the SRH model where they separated the guys and girls
I don't know if someone already said this but arrivederci is indeed one way to say "bye" in Italian. It is used in a formal context and/or said to people you don't really know personally but pay your respects to as you're leaving, such as, for example, a school professor or a store owner. The word comes from putting the words "a rivederci" together, which basically translates to "to seeing each other again".
lmao imagine being one of the actors in this. "so like what do you do for work?" "oh, right now it's just this acting gig for youtube" "cool, can i see?" "uhhh it's complicated"
Just gonna say, I'm vibing with my RhinoShield phone case
the new narrator sounds like mickey mouse
what in gods name happened to the narrators voice what did troom troom do to them
“Arevederla” is the correct term because it’s used for formal (new people you just met or teachers) goodbyes.”Arevaderci” is used for informal goodbyes (used for family and friends ).So this means she knows who the kidnappers are.
"You're a wizard,Danny."
How many sims songs can you fit into a video? Coming soon from Troom Troom.
I think this is my first time seeing nicks entire body lol
We stan rhinoshield. I've had their case for like 5 months now and it still looks like new even though I'm real clumsy and dropped my phone like 1000 times.
Cant wait to use these!
Are you kidnapped? Just go away, pffff. Are you locked up? Time to craft cutie bracelet!
I really love Danny’s troom troom videos. They’re flawless
I absolutely _love_ the fact that the garage Danny rented out is 100 times more menacing than Troom Troom’s “dungeon” was. LOL.  It’s _crazy_ what a little bit of effort can accomplish! LOL.
October 10th will always be remembered as the day Danny Gonzalez circumcised a glue bottle
im sooo confused are we going to ignore the sex doll at 9:08
Can you do your sister face revel pls 😅😅
Good Lord! That  shrieking voice! Imagine that girl as a kid and having a temper tantrum.
this is entirely too funny 🤣🤣
wait because their dynamic is perfect
The shock when the last hack worked
I think a lot of girls are taught the duct tape one
the funniest part of this video is the idea of you inviting that random dude to participate in your strange activities
I feel like the MET police watched this before giving advice to women recently.
Geez, Danny, you clearly have *no* idea what you’re talking about!  I was _actually_ kidnapped once and no, _obviously_ I didn’t disguise myself as a freaking duvet to escape.  I did, however, disguise myself as a pile of throw pillows, and you bet your sweet ass I was yelling “Arriva Derchi, Losers!” and rolling out the back door in *no time!*  So, I mean, get with the program, bro.  LOL.
I like danny and drew, they seem like cool dudes and their vids are well made but i cant watch most of them because the material is just so hard to watch bc 2nd hand cringe. These troom videos have to be intentionally awful i refuse to believe orherwise
This new narrator's voice is my new sleep paralysis demon
wtf happened to the old narrator
DIY to be best friends with the kidnappers ✌️ Nice!
Anyone else feel like these kidnappings life hacks is non sw fetish fulfillment????? 👀
help, lemme go
WHY IS THERE SIMS # MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND OF PARTS OF THIS VIDEO?????? HELLO???
If you’re hands are tied up just remove your hands
danny and nick are so funny together lmao
LETS GOO 100k TH LIKER SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESG
so not only are dannys feet online, they were rated badly on a foot site lol
Imagine if you were kidnapped, and the kidnapper whispered happily in your ear “ Gocha girly”
why the hell does the narrator's voice sound like a cheap version of micky mouse like, WHY
Danny's physical comedy is underrated, him just falling as a plank at the end sent me
1:29 the ‘Gotcha girlie! 🤩🤩🤩’ ended me
Why did I read this as "Trying Tom Nook's Awful Kidnapping Hacks"
The people at wallmart must be confused
ayyy another upload from our boi, Gre(g)nny Gonzalez
"Look at all those criminals" I died
THE SIMS MUSIC
I was kidnapped then I watched this video and was able to escape
I hate their new voice over person
Danny turned a beanie into a mask so Nick could turn it back into a beanie…perfect.
Stockholm syndrome in a nutshell
Troom troom is an abomination.
This video should be renamed "Kidnaper taches me how to escape"
Is it just me r does the voice over sounds like Mickey Mouse?
this is my fave vid uve ever made
Anyone else notice Danny looking to the side of the camera rather than into the camera quite a lot this video?
Their voice over is always bad, but this one is PAINFUL.
don't know if it's true, but i was told once that you need both the matchstick and the box to be able to light up a match. i don't think it works like they show it in the movies
not the sort of kidnapping lifehacks I was expecting
My first read the title I thought troom troom was telling us how to kidnap a child
Idk why but I lost it at the repeating square knot joke
Why does the the first ones socks looks like that
14:26 Maison Margiela coming up with Tabi shoes
e
9:11 look at the menaquin
Just in case anyone's wondering: Snapping someone's neck (at least the way it's shown in movies and in this video) is total fiction. The human neck isn't a twig, it requires a great deal of force to break, the kind of force most people won't be able to generate, especially in one swift, smooth motion. If it really was that easy, we'd be seeing a lot more broken necks from people getting punched in boxing.  What makes this even funnier for me though, is that the actress in the video is shown as doing it while the kidnapper is attacking her from behind and she's clearly struggling to so much as get a solid grip on him. So what, is she breaking his neck using only the power of her wrists? That's one crazy strong kidnappee right there!
Did nobody notice the other kidnapper licking his lips at one point?
The scarf not breaking was actually so fucking funny I can’t breathe
Congrats on trending dan
Youve always been on top for not just talking about it, the skits have class
Most of Danny's crafting problems (the mask, the glue, etc) would've been solved if he could sew
these channels are genius satire right?
I was doing the try not to laugh challenge with water in my mouth and you sir, are just too funny
6916th
The genuine shock of the duct tape one working was gold. It's actually a VERY well known thing that you can do that lol
Woah, did Nick fly out from LA to Chicago just to film this with you? That boy is grinding hard.
Was Kurtis the camera man??? I saw Instagram stories w the three of them together today and the laughs sounded like him
Why tf is rodent Michael narrating that video
Arrivederci means bye in Italian
The neck snapping scene caught me off guard
The people who saw what he bought at that Walmart are probably really suspicious right now
the “kidnapping location” looks like every backstage wing to a highschool theatre ive ever seen
Sims 3 music at the beginning?
please do more videos with your friends, this turned out great 😁
The thing for the tape is a thing for fighting to get out of a grab 😂
I liked the video as soon as she snapped that guys neck, that was too funny
To snap someone’s neck the girl would have to able to apply an equal amount of force to the persons body weight
This sounds like 2 kids on a playground
Shoutout to Danny Gonzalez for being the only YouTuber
Yep, just two dudes and the cameraman hanging out
This has the energy oh two 12 year olds home alone on a weekend
The narrator's voice is so damn grating. Can't stand it at all.
Maybe kidnapping hacks isn’t a good thing to say
The duct tape trick working was such a plot twist!
Fun fact, the duct tape trick actually has been around for a long time, and it even works with zip ties if you do it right
Raiden?    raidan     Liu kang?    Lu raid     Dont know what I mean? Go to 6:50
great video danny!
If they put you in the trunk, kick out the headlights
nick is kind of rude to danny one too many times
I do not like your professionalism Danny Gonzalez, your content has become sour for me as well as another channel,I think I am jealous of your success.
Next time we kidnap Danny, we have to make sure that we use 4 layers of duct tape.
This was beautiful! Pure art!!
I think rhino shield is so far I think at least is the one I’m slightly interested in
now kidnappers will learn a thing or two in their videos
At this point, the kidnapper is the one that helps you and not Troom Troom
22:15 Danny's Bizarre Adventure: Troom Tendency
That is the best way to be tho
I love that you had to put more scotch tape on that criminal even tho you dindt show us how it probably fell off
YESSSSSSSSS
The narrators voice is so annoying MY GOD
i know troom troom doesn't care at all but ngl these sketches are super insensitive to people who have gone through this
When I first heard tiktok text to speech I thought it was the troom troom narrator
At 15:53 my marching band uses that castle as a backdrop for our show this year that’s so crazy
Did you just try to light safety matches on a wall? 😂
Can’t believe danny would rent out a garage for this when his basement literally looks like a kidnapper’s dungeon
The duct tape one!!! You’re supposed to hit it on ur hip!!!! Or in the video she did the knee!!!! It’s a real thing the hip is easier u can do hella layers
If you substitute letters out, Troom Troom can become Broom Broom.
I find it funny that around the 5 minute mark the weird sound they dub over the criminals is from South Park lmao
As a person who does MMA, I can confirm that if someone gets you in a headlock, you can easily break their neck without hurting them
That Sims 3 music though
4:48 that sound effect is from the game, Neighbors from hell  :D
Skip to the end,click replay no ads
"Now I'm gonna crush your bones." Slowly leaning back in chair.  I fucking DIED laughing
Troom troom: are you getting strangled? Danny: yeahhh :/
Danggg troom troom Danny videos are gold mines 864k views in 8 hours
i’m so terrified of the generation being raised on those videos
I mean if someone kidnapped me and I got out, snapping their neck would be a lot kinder than what I'd do
Okay very funny video but like that duct tape one is one I feel like women are taught SO early, my mom showed me how when I was 12
I’m not crazy, the video has 800K+ in 9 hours…. Right?
From memory these guys are from Ukraine and use an American dubb, so if you are wondering why its so weird… that’s the answer!
Alternate title: Danny's Backdoor BDSM Experiments
At the end of the video they say did you like our sketches, so it’s satire not informative
Wait!? Was that guy who was strangling you benoftheweek!?
Danny this video was truly incredible. It really shows how much effort and time it took to make this...absolutely your best one yet. Please make a part 2 one day!
nick do be fine
the voice of the narrator pisses me off so much!!! whyy
This video is the funniest you've made in a while. I was laughing the whole time. Loved Nick being there too
“There’s always an Alexa” That’s actually terrifying since they can and do listen to everything for a megacorporation
Idk if you know Casey Aonso but when you (Danny) say “I’m gonna be” it makes me laugh because you sound just like her 😂😂😂
that poor assistant
lmao not Danny actually getting strangled
This is a good video
3:10 *pardon*
12:04 i hope no wants to work for troom troom so the only the way they get employees is by kidnapping, oh shi
why is this so funny , i was laughing the whole time, made my night
Me: reclining my seat to CRUSH my kidnapper My car: *electric seats*
The neck snap wouldn't work
Your hair looks good bestie
Kinda disappointed that Danny didn't say "Arrivederci, losers" instead of "bye" at the end
arrivederci does mean goodbye but its aLsO a JoJo ReFeRaNcE!111!!111!!!11
BRO NICK WITH HIS HAIR THROUGH THE EYE HOLES OF THE BEANIE AT 29:15 IS SO CUTE
Danny's "wooW" with the glue was a reflection of me when i do dumbass things
First one be like: the best way to escape your kidnappers is pay the ransom!
9:19 for some reason at this part I was eating chips and pretended to crack my neck and then I accidently crunched down on the chips.
31:15 The real life hack to get a concussion real quick in seconds.
“Cut the tip off.”
this video is too long and annoying. im sorry.
This video had me crying laughing 😂
Annoying mickey mouse voiced narrator
"Arrivederci" is Italian for "goodbye".
I’d really love to see a random bystander during the car strangulation part.
I looked it up and Greg is the strongest army on the internet
Fun fact, zip ties are really weak. Just chew them or rip them apart.
The title of this video makes it seem like the life hack is to kidnap people.
“danny im pulling pretty hard!” *keeps pulling*
Danny's cringe tolerance must be legendary.
That ski mask makes u look like griffith from berserk
Do you have a PSG phone case??
If troom troom was kidnapped and did all this the kidnappers will just ransom them for one penny and the cops will just say no keep them pls shoot them
danny really just made me say:- quality > quantity
Definitely checking out rhinoshield it's cool they still support the Note 9, definitely going to get a 76ers case
the voice over sounds like mickey mouse pretending to be a girl
This video killed me, I could not stop laughing, great work
Read the title and thought danny would be kidnapping people. I’m disappointed
To be fair, fabric glue is weak as fuck compared to hot glue, just sayin
I think they were doing something else for the duct tape, like I don't think they had their arm going to their sides (and if they did they didn't say it so they didn't help.) Also, what if you can't move your arms that much. Like (well like Nick said in the video, I think they would put more layers but besides that) they would probably tie your arms to the chair or something so you wouldn't be able to move like that..
<the frog shirt3
You had me chuckling and chortling this whole video
Um... I don't think those are strike anywhere matches. Lol
Ngl Danny's foppy hair lookin a lil depressed lately. I hope Danny's feeding and grooming it properly.
I appreciate that Sims 3 background music 👏
I like to think that if someone were to try to kidnap someone and they saw that video it would render it even more useless than it already was.
The fact that it’s nick who’s the kidnapper and his introduction to danny was something like “I know where Danny lives” which caused ppl to be mad at Nick,,, ah yes, this is S tier content
Omggg dannnyyy I love ur troom troom videos there how I found u 🤗
The narration is............. uncomfortable.
what sucks about content factories like Troom Troom is that they are targetted for and viewed by kids (really young, like under 15), if they don't understand these are jokes and try to test it out, it could lead to serious injuries or even worse. I know of so many kids who already have tried out 5 Minutes Crafts shitty "hacks" and suffered burns and cuts. These channels are causing more harm than good, and they should just stop.
i got way too hyped over the duct tape one working, i was over here standing up and cheering like my fav football team hit a touch down   edit: its called a touch down right? i know literally nothing about sports
love the sims music
I will never not love your Troom Troom video life hacks they are just too good!!!!
That was my exact experience with that same fabric glue
The curious yet oddly supportive bystander is my favorite character in this episode
Never stop making videos
5:36 Guys guns dont kill people. Criminals kill people. And criminals are guns. - Danny Gonzalez 2021
The thing with tape is real. I’ve only seen it with zip ties tho. But you’re supposed to pull down and back
Oooh I thought we were going to learn _how_ to kidnap someone  I wasn't going to question it
The hide under the duvet cover hack is awesome! … That is, if you’re me at four years old trying to scare my dad in his room when he comes home from work.
When Nick was giving the lecture about how to get out of the duct tape, how did Danny not completely lose it every time he looked at Nick with his glasses over the ski mask and the ski mask in his eyes
The rope exhale hack is how Houdini did some rope escapes.
fairly certain troom troom has transitioned into an artistic era where they merely use the "life hack" format as a vessel for some truly meta-level absurdist comedy that most of us are merely not smart enough to fully understand or comprehend. I know I'm not
Nice Chicago shirt you should come to Chicago and see the giant bean it’s our famous bean
Just out wierd the kidnaper (it works best if you have a thing for it)
Danny is going to die if he keeps on trying troom troom life hacks
9:22 well this video took   a sharp turn
Thank you for uploading Danny
I always laugh so freaking hard when I watch your videos.
7:51 the one accurate thing they put in the video was the Ford breaking down
Danny this video is so funny thank you for all your hard work
I like how they used a card bored box to draw mortal kombat in it as the tv but like raiden’s face tho 😭😂
They literally took the loose chain breathing thing for horses, horses will tense up when there saddle is being tightened so that they have more space
19:06 get someone who looks at you the way danny looks at nick
Since when did Goofy swap careers to become a youtube commentator?
I choked on my Cheerios watching this video
Troom Troom seems to have a lot of guys strangling women in it.  I"m not saying there's anything behind that, but I'm not saying there isn't either.
I’d rather be kidnapped than listen to the narrators voice, it’s just somehow so irritating to listen to.
You could do that duck tape hack with zip ties
The dude in the yellow shirt looks like the caribou guy from the polar express
I needed to laugh today XD
You’re almost at 5 mil buddy boy, that’s crazyyyyyy
At least Troom Troom has embraced the fact that they're a joke and make actual joke videos now.
arrivederci - goodbye; until we meet again ;))
4:25 Oh no! He’s got Mlohkcots syndrome.
So you managed to avoid hot glue gun only to be struck by molten zip ties
I love how in the first video the trap itself was just a trap
I love his sarcasm on stuff 😂😂😂
“In today’s video we’re going to be kidnapping troom trooms life hacks”
why the foot at 14:20 look like the cover of fear and loathing in Las Vegas
17:33 We need a 1 hour loop of this right now 😭
Does troom troom have a kidnapoing/ stalker fetish?
This is exactly what i needed
Wait I'm LOSING my mind over the duct tape
I laugh when the “ kid-napper” was explaining how to break free to his supposed victim. Like “ no no no, elbows to the sides.” . . “ 😲 ✋🤚 OOOOoohhh wat ”  27:20 “You did it! :D”
3:08 the socks.
Make more videos with this guy, he's hilarious
I LOVED this video
Someone got his hair did😉
Drew lookin different
The girl didnt need the matches she could have just stood up and pushed it open it was just a push gate ..?
Why do the kidnappers talk like animal crossing villagers
Bro why is there an Alexa in this random storage unit
Bruh danny gonzalez gives more useful life hacks talking about other people’s life hacks
- it seemed like I choked u for a while back there -YOU DID I can't lmaooooo
I just realized half of the voice sound effects are Clash Royale sounds I can’t unhear it now.
it’s funny cause the duct (scotch) tape trick is a real thing that people say to do when you’re in that situation, a lot of self defense classes will teach that if they talk about being tied up with tape like that
I want someone to look at me the way that Nick looked at Danny in that scarf
The pulling back with your elbows on the duck tape one is an actual navy seal trick that works with a lot of layers
the narrators voice angers me
Not Gonna lie, Martin Kinda did a Great Job. I am so Proud that he managed to Traumatize that girl. Great Job Martin 👍!!
just guys being dudes and kidnapping each other 🥰
2:43 I didn't think that vegan teacher would be in a Danny Gonzalez video
When I was kidnapped I left
31:15 i’m crying
Fr, what’s up with the sims life music in the back danny?
23:28 non jojo fans be like
that last one is often used by magicians
BTS fact: danny wore the toe sock on one foot and a normal sock on the other for the whole day of filming.
Bro I laughed so hard in this video-       good job on being yurself
I mean… killing your captor would be an effective method of escape
Guys the robber with the money bag emoji is actually a real thing! Here it is: 🔫
13:34 ayo Venom 2 looks crazy
Danny you look good in anything. especially that skii mask
Wait, so the kidnappers could afford a PS5 but not a TV... Yeah, sure, okay!
Danny's ski mask looks like a closet cosplay of Griffith from Berserk
I like how they a ps5 but can't get a TV
ha, nice haircut DANNY
actual kidnapping lifehack, if you’re in a trunk of a car as long as it’s not ancient, there should be a glow in the dark release that will open the trunk. but if there isn’t you can kick out the headlights and try to wave someone down
The future kidnappers in the comments taking notes lol
I dont know i feel like Danny shpuld be concerned with how many people enjoyed him getting choked and sayimg he was choking according to these comments.
"the tip was closed. i had to cut the tip off." -Danny Gonzalez 2021 is now my fav quote
it's the narrators Voice that's got me Lmfao
toe socks
My favorite TROOM TROOM Danny vid! The face he made when he ripped through the 3 layers 😮‍💨 the fact that Nick was ACTUALLY STRANGLING HIM 🤣 it was all hilarious! Great job guys
Finding yourself in a car with an attacker is terrifying! 💞✨🥰
14:23 I feel like Danny said, “You guys will never know” because he thought about holding his foot up to the camera but wanted to avoid having it posted to WikiFeet
Why do these Troom Troom videos feel like fetish bait.
8:27 : They're legally not skilled to chase you.
THIS WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNNNNYYY
There both just making each other extremely uncomfortable
The ugly cackle I let out when he just moved out of the way of the car seat going back
WHY ARE THEY DOWNPLAYING KIDNAPPING TO CHILDREN?!?HUH!!???!?!?????!!!!!????????
the mouth hole XD
What if it turns out that Danny bank rolls troomtroom so he can make these videos making fun of them. 🤯
The way the narrator says "Martin" bothers me more than anything else in this video.
21:47 the wink tho 🤣👋
9:09 JOJO REFERENCE
Does gen z not know that strike anywhere matches exist? Matches that aren’t strike anywhere need to be struck on the box
So proud of Nick, he used to just be Kurts Connor's editor and look at him now! He upgraded all the way to being Danny's kidnapper
Why is the person who gets kidnapped in troom troom always a girl? You sayin' boys can't be kidnapped???
This video is going to be sp useful
“Are you talking about a gun?” “Huh?” “Like this?” “Ah, he’s back.!”
Thank u for this video Danny I really needed this laugh <3
Thank u for this video Danny I really needed this laugh <3
I loved this video Danny!!! I’ll keep showing my support :)
this video was so fun  i do appreciate that he rented out a warehouse room purely for the aesthetic 😂
Crap Drew’s been kidnapped
yalls chemistry is so fucking funny yall are like noel and cody
I was watching this with my foster kittens and the whole video, whenever Danny was on screen, he kept trying to scratch at Danny's face lol
See the thumbnail: Haha looks funny.  Read the title: The wut-
Them not knowing what arrivederci means Me and other JJBA fans: Rare Rare Daze
middle school sleepover vibes
i am begging the narrator to please pronounce the "t" in martin
i think im free?                                          Well i found out im not 0/10 NOT usefull
Hi
yo where did you film this
22:29 feels like something out of The Office
This is definitely me when I get kidnapped
Dang it Danny. "Ahhh he's back" made me drop my phone in the bath
seems like troom troom wins 2-1 this time
I fucking lost it when you showed they cut out holes on the masks that already had a face hole
Martin tho 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Lmfao “there’s so many criminals in here”
did they get a new voice actress? i don't remember her being _that_ annoying
Fun fact! You can do the same thing Danny did with the duct tape if your hands are zip tied together.
Thanks! I usually get kidnapped 8.57 times a day, so these life hacks works perfectly.
I think I'm seeing some facial wrinkle on Danny's face. ...Oh shit! my life is becoming a lie.
Life hack: If your kidnapper drops the keys to your handcuffs, just pick 'em up you doober! Then you can unlock your cuffs and get away.
aye that tape one is actually helpful! thanks for proving it dan<3
Thanks for making me laugh way too fucking hard in a subway.
Please don't snap people's necks wtf
Danny should do a video on simply piano ads
Did Todd Flanders narrate this?
I think this is too groom young kids that kidnapping isn't that scary they know their target audience age it's actually really creepy on a deep level of you think about it
So, your kidnappers flick matches into your cell so you can light the match on a brick and melt your ziptie handcuffs. (what if they were real handcuffs lol) and once you melt the handcuffs, you just casually walk out of the conveniently unlocked cell door. Wow.
Troom Troom lifehacks is just a wackier version of wikihow pages, basically.
The best part about this vid is the parents in the picture frame who are also criminals wearing ski masks 😭
good night youtube yeahhhh
NICK!!!!1
I’m cryingggg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
not the “gotcha girly” plz i’d be laughing too hard to fight back 💀
21:48 ….Hear me out
8:09 .WTH?
“This is so gross, dude. I don’t know why anyone would want to watch this” I AM SCREAMING 💀💀💀
jokes on you, toe socks are my kink.
Why is the narrators voice so annoying, it is so obnoxious like oh my fricking God
Danny this isn’t Wattpad
When I first reed this title I thought it was life hacks for kidnapping people.
Whens Christine gonna do these?
nick posing after putting on the ski mask is cracking me up
As always, the Troom Troom videos continue to be godly
The first vid’s ending is straight up j Stockholm syndrome
if Danny was a kidnapper he would be the most non threatening kidnapper in the world
The picture is just the lady eating a BANANA
15:52 is that the castle from re8
you can also break zip ties with the duck tape method!
Oh silly Danny, being kidnapped for the sake of entertainment
Who else " joy farted" when Danny was actually getting choked?
If the backwards ski masks don't tell you their videos are trollish, the babies with ski masks has to.
Wait at 3:39 there was no lock on the door. Why didn’t you just run as soon as the guard left.
ngl, if i was kidnapped, unharmed, and let go after a few days i would be happy, i would get atleast a month off school         0-0
So a lifehack is a hack that's meant to improve your quality of life by like giving you a new and better way to do a mundane thing right? like a time saver? so how often and casually do you have to get kidnapped for the terminology to go from "self defense lesson" to "kidnapping lifehacks?"
this is just mythbusters
ok this video rocks
But Danny I’m only 5 years old.. will I be able to break the duct tape!?!?!?!
12:39  “ give me your…… self I gues. I’m a kidnapper not a robber” Omg i am dying🤣🤣
“You got nice skin” killed me, and “for a youtuber” brought me back and killed me again
The actual choking thing is supposed to be dropping a manual seat back while you're being choked, which hopefully gives enough slack on whatever you're being choked with to take it off.  But I guess that's not much of a craft.
Are you graying
3:08 so are we just… are we just not gonna talk about her socks… cause-
Try watching those videos with misophonia and not ripping your head from your goddamn shoulders.
6:06 , I miss delocated, funny series
The scarf one made me laugh so hard I threw up I am shaking and coughing and I am owed financial compensation
Guns don’t kill people, criminals kill people
Where is your outro sir?
Are matches always that long? I feel like I've never seen matches that long
"hey bro do you wanna tie me up in a garage I rented out" "danny" "for a video I swear"
i’m dying, were they even using strike anywhere matches?? 😂
The English accent of that video's narrator reminds me of my nursery teacher's English accent.
nick thought he was on spring breakers for a second there
I think troom troom is threatening you, Danny.
I actually learned about the duct tape thing in high school and they made all the girls do it for practice
Lmao
on today's video: Danny... ...circumsizes a glue bottle ...gets choked ...shows socked feet ...and plays with fire sticks you're not welcome
Waffles are my favorite
This was an excuse for Danny to explore his sub kink...we know all the hints throughout previous videos!
29:00
the narrator sounds like the new Missy from Big Mouth
☻-☻
6:33 The sound that escaped me at this moment 💀💀💀 nearly choked over my own breath lol
Nice sims 4 music
6:33 The sound that escaped me at this moment 💀💀💀 nearly choked over my own breath lol
4:40 I think I’ve seen this before 🤨 ⬛️🟧
"Definitely gonna do these life hacks when I got captured by Italian mafia, Mexican cartel, or something like that. They won't have any changes from an avid Troom-Troom enjoyer because I'll be the next Houdini! Haha!"  *dies
" I had to cut the tip off "- Danny Gonzalez 2021
they used grey fabric tape which is made to rip easily not duct tape but lets all ignore that and pretend because i dont want to take away that joy they got when danny ripped it
Love the Sims 3 music in the background
Please review or talk about simply guitar and simply piano ads
"Arrivederci" Is that a fucking Jojo reference
I love that in my province in Canada these masks are 100% available at this time of year. Watching someone make one makes me SCARED. 😂
Not me going to test out the duct tape thing coz that was damn cool and I need to see it for myself.
guys this isn't a kidnapping sketch this is a sketch where the'kidnapped' girl is the sugar mommy of the two guys and as payment, she sends a TV.
Her voice makes me wanna rip my hair out
I can’t stop laughing at how terrible these all went…
at 9:07 what is that mannequin doing in the background what is troom troom doing?
That’s a dope sweatshirt Danny’s Wearing fam
Nick goes on to teach self defense 😂
19 on trending
31:16 he has transcended to smooth criminal
WHY THE HELL DOES THE NARRATOR SOUND SO BAD🌹
Okay where did Danny get his Airsoft gun from? That looks like a type of Berreta and I want it!   Also from a little shared experience from law enforcement: You'd use only 1 zip tie for anyone you're restraining, maybe 2 if they have significantly thick arms, because you want to prevent as much movement as possible. Think about the how they were tied with the duct-tape, but even then it's still possible to reach for a pocket if you have a knife. I bring this up because I want to see someone make ACTUAL tactics for escaping kidnappings, like that duc-tape one, as it would be fun to watch.
My man I’d literally give you a thousand likes for “oh I gotta cut the tip off the glue”
i can't handle the narrator's voice
Breathing IN to loosen the chains when you relax...? Supposing that would work, breathing in would make it tighter for you when you relax. You making more space for them to chain you up not less. I'm disappointed in Troom Troom for not getting at least that right
The narrator on the troom troom video sounded like Missy from big mouth
I’m pretty sure I was actually taught the duct tape hack in some self defense class
Danny is the only YouTuber I’ll ever watch a full 30 minute video of
e
Why did he smell the chain?
as a knitter, that part with the sock hurt me.
Danny saying "arrivederci" hurt
Not only did I hysterically laugh the entire video but now I’m going to practice escaping from duck tape
"aRe yOu TieD uP wiTh sCoTcH TaPe?" "na its duct tape"
ITS FREAKING NICK IS NOT FREAKIN GREEN
With life hack 2 troom troom forgot the fact that ppl are unconscious while being tied up aka as relaxed as possible
Troom troom is going through an edgy phase 😔
As a former criminal (the criminal kind, not the gun kind) I find it highly offensive that Danny thinks I'm not good at arts and crafts. That is a viscous lie!
Ahhh, now I understand the "son of a gun" insult! Thanks Danny :D
This thumbnail is amazing 😂
Danny saying she’s “nowhere near the wall” when she’s very near the wall is so funny to me
"So I guess if you're tied up, just stand up" 23:09 😂 is the same as 😂 "If you're kidnapped in a car, just get out of the car" 8:20
Why does Troom Troom seem like some fake Russian channel that has some type of subliminal type messaging and all the “Actors” are trafficking victims?
Did they change the narrator I'm going to actually cry
Moral of the story: being able to throw it back hard enough to crush the kidnapper in your back seat is an asset.     *No puns intended.
9:10 no one is going to talk about the manikin in the bottom left
Stop cutting things Danny lmao wtf🤣😂
This video is youtube premium fr
The sims 3 creator music is throwing me off a little. I kinda like the usage though
This was hilarious, you should have Nick on more often!
I better go check out Danny's channel because every time Drew drops a video, so does Danny.
E
The troom troom narrator is doing a really shitty Mickey Mouse impression while talking about kidnapping a girl.
just gonna put this out there, if you actually get kidnapped, focus on staying alive and calm, not breaking out of whatever restraints you might have on. you won’t be able to magically get away just because you aren’t restrained anymore, and, unless you have a very clear opportunity (like being left alone in a room full of weapons) escape should be lower on your list of priorities than finding a way to contact the police.
Danny and troom troom, is just wow❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gotta be honest ,Danny. The gun being reported as the robber joke wasn't funny :/ Im sorry
the graphics being used messing me up more then they should
💅🏻✨🥲Get out of my throat”🥲✨💅🏻
trooom troom is being unironically funny more and more
YOU DIDN'T GIVE HIM A TV. YOU'RE A FRAUD
Why does Danny puff out his cheeks like a kid when he's trying to keep in air and expand his frame 😂
Not showing your feet? Jokes on you, my dude. I'm into hands
danny looks like spiderman with that thing
I feel like the title of the video could be misleading as to what the hacks are going to help you accomplish 🤣
what an odd continuity error that the guy delivering the tv was wearing orange and the cuts to a close up and he's wearing red
4:47 that's markiplier's voice
Danny out here copping the Gundham Tanaka scarf I see
11:00 imagine they grab the scarf by the velcro ends because you didnt put itnon correctly 😭 then what
Welp kid's watch this
They make getting kidnapped seem so much fun and easy.
For crack a neck youve to ave a Big Big strenght you neck dont broke like that
So happy with this collab
Duct tape is actually really easy to rip vertically, like you can easily do it with your fingers, I think with scotch tape or packing tape it wouldn't work actually!!
21:43 Danny doing the joker pose while being kidnapped
The gun jokes 😂🤣 I'm dying
Nick and Danny running together in slow-mo was honestly the best part of the video
The narrator: ⭐♥️💘🥳❄🌈YOU JUST GOT KIDNAPPED
I love this crossover
11:50
I love how you can still see who is in the ski mask. No one will catch you now.
i love it when people make silly goofy videos about stuff some people actually worry about all the time.
the dungeon girl's socks having toes though, I'm disturbed
The kidnappers are da vinki twins
That first vid was written like those 1D Wattpad fanfics where one fo the members kidnaps you but the OC appreciates it and acts quirky the whole time
I love 30 minute videos, thanks for the hard work
Mickey Mouse: GATCHA GIRLIE
love the sims music
And after melting the zip tie the door will be automatically unlocked.. Besides  why couldn't  you just run with your hands bound?
This was literally your best video in awhile. I laughed so hard!
I cannot with Troomtroom. Like bruh.😭💀
That ender was madness
9:33 no but seriously this should be taught more bc lots of women are afraid of causing scenes and getting blamed if the person gives up and tries to play it off. its like deeply engrained in women to always be polite and it's disgusting.
The kidnapper falling in love with her was....  Concerning. Little kids should absolutely not be watching that bro wthhhhh. Especially considering how manipulative children kidnappers are.
The fact that these are sometimes recommended to children is concerning
Never gonna give you up
ello
danny is funny without even trying. Literal god.
The ambiance is immaculate 😘👌🏽✨
Me after someone says something I didn’t understand but my social anxiety is forcing me to respond: “That’s the way to be though.”
Nick do be lookin a lil like Harry Potter from the side 🥴
whys no one talking about the Sims 3 music
Gotta say I was half expecting something when the kidnappers threw her on the bed
Whats a square knot .... the kinds knot you would tie ya square
I am now proudly Greg, aka part of the fastest-growing channel on the internet. And no, I will not look that up :)
Great now I know what not to do when I want to kidnap someone
That ski mask you made is like the opposite of wearing a mask and sunglasses.
Can’t wait for the how to kidnap video
I love how the cardboard TV looks like a gloryhole…
You can kidnap with the whole family if you only follow troom trooms 10 step plan, and also get 5 more for an added cost of 19.99
No one:  Literally no one:  Danny: aRiVaDURcHy

I'm starting to believe that these life hack videos came from another universe.
This is very offtopic, but the touch of Sims music being played in this video makes it truly an artistic masterpiece.
Man, good to see Cody with a haircut after so long.
This is the hardest I’ve laughed in so long
"It's not super common that your kidnappers will just leave you alone with matches" Deadpool: *sweats nervously*
I saw video from the try guys where they had these guys that actually teach people how to escape kidnapping situations as a job. They said to use friction wire for zip ties and talked about a few other items for breaking out can't remember what. they said to get a bandage or bandaid and put it behind there somewhere your hands can reach so even if they took your bag, clothes etc you would still theoretically have it, so you put it on when you are going out at night or if you going to walk home in a secluded area stuff like that
Ok I really wanna finish this video but the new troom troom narrator is killing me. Why does she sound like that?
This video made me loose it. The pep talk before finally breaking the SCOTCH tape was the cherry on top
Toe Sock sales: 📈
When I was homeschooled I took a class that taught survival skills like getting out of a kid-napping situation. You can do that duck-tape trick with zip-ties too it just hurts the heck out of your wrists, although if you were actually kid-napped i think the adrenaline would mask the pain lol
The video and the 'hacks' are REALLY worst but the narrator voice made the video even more worse💀
To be honest if I was kidnapped nick is the worst person to be kidnapped by
how fucking embarrassing would it be to attempt the duct tape escape and have it fail so spectacularly in front of your kidnapper lmao
Watching these people act … hurts me … deeply …
❤️❤️❤️
13:26 dollarstore batman
How are you still twelve??
Beannnzzz
How is this TroomTroom video allowed on YouTube?!?! Wtf, Susan?? 🤨😂
look up raiders of the lost shark really dumb, really odd. Gonna post this on one of drews videos aswell sooooooo
this video left me gasping for air dude it was so funny dhxbshzha
danny i love you but i can't through that narrator lmao
I'm convinced that it's service for women whose kink is kidnapping and she's tipping them with a large tv
Sorry Danny, your feet are already all over wikiFeet
it's illegal to kidnap someone against their will
curious about what other knots Danny knows😏
I have that same Beretta M92F BB gun, but it doesn't have the orange tip on it
the narrator is someone trying and failing to do a mickey mouse impression change my mind
Why did the narrator in the first one sound like a bad Mickey mouse impression 😭
Does anyone know where his shirt is from
Danny I want your shirt. Where can I get one?
my dumbass would just end up getting shot lmao
GREAT JOB DANNY!
Such a good vid, nick compliments you well
danny’s smug face when he got out of the tied rope 😭😭😭😭😭😭
nick should kidnap danny more often
Does anyone know the song he used for 22:03 - 22:11? I’m just curious because it sounds so familiar
Are they tactical tho?
these lifehacks hurt my brain
Try to get Danny to 5 million!
I don't know when Troom Troom started the whole 'arrivederci' thing, but they need to stop this instant.
THE FACT THAT HE ACTUUALLY RENTED THE GARAJE TNFHNFDTNUM
How did I get here again OOOOOOOOOOH NOOOO IM GETTING STRANGLED
I think it’s they aren’t actual hacks, they’re just skits
7:21 SHEESH
JoJo fans after hearing goodbye in another language: BUCCIARATI
Sent Nick and Danny panic about the choking sent me frfr
13:16 ash from fmf
If the kidnappers don’t come back after 15 minutes, you’re legally allowed to leave.
Okay is anyone going to talk about how at 9:14 there’s a mannequin laying on the floor?
The narrator sounds like Minnie Mouse
Kidnappers after this video: 👹Guess I need 4 layers of duct tape now👺
Lets give it up for the kidnappers guys. They out here workin there asses off and end up with a girl who looks like she used candy as makeup.
Everyone that sees this comment comment dog then you own animal check the most resent comment and add on to that comment of animals with your own let's see how long we can get it
what did danny look up for tht foot pick
"yeah, you were"
I feel like Danny will eventually start feeling Stockholm Syndrome with Troom Troom
Danny why didn’t you buy Nick a tv after all this?
5:58 Isn't this joke stolen from the Simplisafe ads? I swear there was one where the robber showed a family photo and they were all in ski masks.
21:55 I’m stealing that joke
Hehe
13:06 I WAS IN TEARS LAUGHING HELP ME
Here he goes again!
I hate how artificially high and hollow the narrator's voice is.
No but Danny legit ripped the velcro off of the scarf instead of pulling the pieces of velcro apart
Pretty sure centaurs don’t have cloven hooves. You’d resemble a satyr.
24:00 looks like batnick and dannyman are plotting their next attack
I died with the whole “look at those criminals!” And the guns and the whole but geez laughed and tears were shed 😂😂😂😂
I just got kidnapped Huh? Troom troom just posted a video? It’s how to escape a kidnapping just what I needed!  Kidnapper: what are you watching back there? Just some troom troom! Your a good person your free to go
“Thanks for kidnapping me so well, guys! I’m going to send you a TV just to thank you for kidnapping me!”                                  -Skyler
Are we just gonna ignore how this video is clearly for kids and they're literally saying you can have a bunch of fun playing with matches?  Kidnapped? not on fire? We're here to help :-)
God I hate this narrator I miss the old one
the added growls and mumbles lmao huh
i thought i was gunna get life hacks on how to kidnap someone.. unsubbed
I didn’t expect to watch a Danny Gonzalez bondage video today… but here I am.
at first i was shocked that danny and nick didn’t know about that move that breaks the duct tape around your wrists, but then i remembered….ah yes im a woman. we’re taught some form of self defense from a young age cuz we need to protect ourselves from kidnapping or assault at any time :)
hi
I’M SCARED 😏
Try the duct tape thing but with different tape cause duct tape is meant to be ripped without scissors
breathing out while you're getting tied up does work actually.
nick??? nick, is that you back there? :)
I gotta say, that tree frog shirt. Pretty baller. 100/10
Incredible collab! I love nick and Danny’s energy together, and their dynamic is absolutely hilarious :)
Im REALLY surprised that the last "Life hack" worked!
the tape one is real
Buys a beanie cuts eye and mouth holes and then assailant goes on to wear it as a beanie...lol
THE VOIIIICEEE! it's worse than ever!!
Honestly troom troom has went from terrible life hacks to being kinda funny. They're so ridiculous now nobody could think they're not a joke, not even a kid (except the people in this comment section :P). These videos do have their moments, like the baby robbers.
6:31  ''doo-vayy'
It’s pronounced ahh-ree-vahh-d-air-chee (that’s not a perfect way to do it but it’s kinda close) also roll the r, it is italien for goodbye.
I couldn't stop laughing wtf was this video I absolutely loved it
Kid nappers watching this 👁👄👁
This is so funny omg
"tHeY hAvE ChAiNs"
Best part of this vidoe is the frog T shirt                                                          It's a really good vidoe
the real criminal was that tiny black fuzz… 😔🖐  rip Danny
Danny and Nick being so amazed by the duct tape hack while all the girls watching have known about it for years
Danny youre making my left ear self conscious
Why did the narrator voice drop in quality to, like, primary/elementary school student level? Did their budget get unexpectedly cut by like 99%, or....?
he said us
This is absolutely the funniest video I’ve ever watched
Hahahahaha i am subscribed and turned on the notification bell
I can't believe that these guys met from Danny's ads
When you get out of the duck tape so you tie up your kidnapper and show them how to get out
the sound on the duct tape when danny breaks it first sounds like hes dislocating his entire body
Knowing troom troom, I was expecting you to say that they were teaching people how to kidnap
0:00 amogus
HI
I feel like actual scotch tape would be harder to break out of, because it isn't meant to rip like duct tape and instead just stretches...
I've literally been feeling bummed and stressed out with school and work today was so tiring, but then Danny just swoops in with this video that made my day
7:18
Sometimes when it feels like I’m being kidnapped, I just stop being kidnapped, and be awesome, instead.
Is Danny Gonzales Will join Corridor again?
wouldn’t it make more sense to breathe out while being tied because that would create more room or am i tripping
21:47 ok but like why was the wink so good
The car “hack” could work too. We used to have a car that opened to the trunk like that, but the mechanism to open it was on the outside, so you’d have to break it open and make a ton of noise in the process. However, a dependable fact to know is that all cars made in America after 2002 have a glow-in-the-dark handle in an easy to find location that releases the trunk from the inside. People sometimes get shoved into their own trunks, so locating where yours is at is a good idea. Also, if you have a car from 2001 back, s as mechanic can install one for around $50. It’s worth it; it could literally save your life!
I swear to god I'm going to throw my ears out why does that narrator sound like a Mickey mouse from hell
DUCT TAPE IS PERFORATED GUYS
This was a good fucking video lmaoooooo I needed the laughs at the situational awkwardness of him actually choking
nick !!!!!!!!!
The troom troom narrator voice is the human equivalent to that god awful tiktok tts
not for free you say?
“Get out of my throat” That’s what she coughed
That duct tape thing is...I almost want to try-
the comedy of there being an actual alexa in the building
danny being amazed of the duct tape hack every time is quality entertainment
Bu
cheese
Stockholm syndrome hits differently in Troom Troom's world
adore the video! although you may want to go back and re-watch it considering there are a lot of editing mishaps, especially within the first 5 - 12 mins
She needs to stop trying to speak italian its making my ears bleed every time I hear her attempt to say arrivederci
I thought it was going to be hacks for kidnapping someone
Can someone start a petition to get the old troom troom narrator back, please. The new one is giving me a headache.
youre gonna what
What's weird is that they give us the "chop-break" thing to escape from the duct tape around your hands, but they didn't do that trick with the Zip-tie handcuff at the start (which should work if you try hard enough), and i'm sure that Zip-tie is weaker than multiple layers of duct tape
This vid made me L O L especially the coughing part wowza. Great job Danny!
The sims music playing in the background 😍
Danny's gotta put a lot of force into throwing it back 😳
NO FUCKING WAY A LIFE HACK ACTUALLY WORKED 😱😱😱
24:29 laughing my ass off at this.
Oh no
The "breathe in when you're being tied up" is a thing I've heard some horses do when you're putting their saddle on. And I saw the duct tape tip given by a cop or something before.
Wtf is that shit on the girl's face or am I just old??
Fun fact: before all this madness Troom Troom was actually a really cute and innocent DIY channel. I really want Danny to do a documentary on how they became like this.
So ur just going to ignore the doll with deformed hips in the back of the troop groom video😃
My god finally
danny frantically laughing while he's being choked is me
Ggggreg is grrreeeaat
how did they make the narrator voice worse, like its usually terrible but this is like the voice you make when talking to a baby or a pet except for like 20 minutes. and on this specific video too like what
24:28 this is the cutest kidnapper I've ever seen lol
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ALEXA??
CRUSH THEM
Would that all the kidnapping victims who met horrific fates and haunt the annals of true crime had just watched troom troom. Then things would be ... probably exactly the same.
"since when are criminals good at arts and crafts" UHHH 1968?
You know why the duct tape trick worked? Because Troom Troom didn’t come up with it lol. That advice has been circulating for quite a while.
Ugh they made kidnapping look like a joke
Thank you Danny. This video made me crack up
ah you know just a regular day, hanging out with friends, laughing, *kidnapping your friends* , having fun
I have made a mistake watching this before going to sleep.  I am haunted by the raw bizarre energy of these troomtroom videos.
oh my god a minute in– Are these hacks FOR THE KIDNAPPERS???
dungeon dragon af
It seems like Troom Troom is just becoming ironic at this point, genuinely making some funny jokes now
Actually for the chain one your suposed to breathe in as much as you can before they tie you up to have more space
Finnaly you make a video about this I ha v e been waiting. A
2:37 danny, i'm not going to be scared in a dungeon with dry wall and hard wood flooring
Gets kidnapped, escapes, buys kidnappers a TV. Classic Stockholm Syndrome.
The narrator's voice is physically hurting me.  Those videos are straight up unwatchable because of that voice.
I almost choked on my drink
Okay, Danny winking is all I need in life.
I LOVE ITTT
That god awful voice is literally Marge Simpson meets Mickey Mouse
I was yelling at the screen for him to cut the tip of the bottle off.  I'm glad that he figured it out, otherwise I would have gone to bed mad.
Ah yes, another one of Dan's TroomTroom Videos.
I turned on post notifications
watching Danny struggle so much with literally any type of glue hurts my crafter brain
If you pause at 6:49  you can see that they tried to draw mortal kombat 11
Ganny Gongalgez
I am legitimately feeling the same feels from when Danny breaks the duct tape (spoilers) as I was during whatever happened in Rudy, I can't remember, that movie was from forever ago, but I'm just as proud today
i turned on notifications  aM i GrEg YeT???
the way she talks make me wanna bash my temple into a counter corner
That scarf actually looks great, Danny should wear more scarves
I actually learned that last trick with zipties. I didn't realize it would work with duct tape, too! That's actually pretty neat
lol literally a mask that only covers the nose and cheekbones😄
I feel like groom groom is trying to depict Stockholm Syndrome  in a weird roundabout way for the first video
i know this is a light hearted video, and troom troom hopefully isnt being serious but it hits a little too close to home. i feel like troom troom is trivializing struggles women have to go through.
I think the hacks only work if you're actually being kidnapped? Maybe? Give that a try
I can't believe the duct tape one worked....
No fucking way, i was convinced the duct tape "trick" wouldn't work
“there’s always an alexa.”
How has this channel not gotten anyone killed yet...       Not Danny, Troom Troom.
Danny and kurtis collabs are always the best!
“yeah but now you’re still tied up 😏… oh” and “should i invite him over here ?”
i didn't know you had friends
wow i can’t believe danny actually got kidnapped for a video
This is amusing
Seeing a rhino shield ad the day after I crack my phone >>>
For the duck tap your supposed to break it over your nee
9:10 jojo reference
The joy of YouTube is that you can create content about anything you feel passionate about, however silly the subject matter.
OK?
I always knew Nick was a kidnapper
Some kid is gonna watch these troom troom videos and get themselves killed….
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh my God, I have actual tears from this. Nick tying Danny up was so goddamn hilarious, but Danny escaping the chair and *not* the emotional prison of shame Nick threw him in again was exceptional 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hello
“I wonder how much force I would have to put into throwing it back the crush someone” 10:18
If Danny runs a marathon is he speedy gonzalez
I was audibly crying watching Danny make that mask
The next thing Troom Troom will do is how to kidnap the president and I will be there watching it but not using it
maybe they have a dungeon cuz they kinky. also you need strike anywhere matches
Aspiring YouTuber puts days of work into original, creative content.  10,000 views  "Light the match with your toe socks to escape from this room of gun criminals!"   50 million views
Okay this video was fucking hilarious.
the scarf one is just dumb. no, this guy is not gonna be stunned by your agility to remove your scarf like that, he's just gonna strangle you with his hands.
Dababy
3:05 her socks have toes that f*cking disgusting
Danny this is important, where did you get the tree frog shirt?
Idk who Nick is but I love him
The narrator is giving me a migraine.
wdym obviously velcro scarf is a daily carry even in summer
She got Stockholm Syndrome in 1.2 seconds.
Is the production quality super high in this video, or is it just me?
How does the other dude not know anything
As soon as Nick was like, "Couldn't you just lean over and pick it up with your hands," I knew I wanted a whole series of Troom Troom Trials with this guy bringing that A Game
6:19 reminds me of that tiktok of the kid who's gonna be a criminal when he gets older
when danny made the mouthpiece, it made the mask completely useless lol
I'm genuinely impressed at the duct tape one working
So the car strangulation thing- this just happened to a woman in my town a few weeks ago. Some dude was hiding in a woman's backseat and he popped up and started strangling her. She sped up then slammed on her brakes and that was enough force to cause him to lose his grip. She was able to get out & get away. The dude was arrested pretty quickly (small town) then the dude unalived himself in jail a few days later. K bye.
God the narrator voice made me want to jump out of my window
Great job Kevin!
cutting that beanie into a mask is Danny’s joker origin story
AWESOME VIDEO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"the kind of knot you'd tie . . . you *fucking square* " is *so hilarious* to me
The crooks family photo was an incredible joke, also why do I want to watch a movie about them?
This had no business being the funniest video on youtube
Troom troom kidnapping victims all suffer from a special case of Stockholm syndrome
You guys are so hilarious trying out the life hacks. That and the hat making scene were hilarious. Thanks for the laughs 😅
i agree ive tried kidnapping people with these life hacks and none of them have worked
Love the sims music
Troom trooms shit is hilarious!!
and a friend to tie me up , sounds kinky
The narrator's voice is terrifyingly high-pitched and chipper. I feel like at any moment she's going to start saying something like "Oh no! It looks like this girl ended up in the basement! She better get away before the kidnappers notice her and break both her legs!"
is nobody going to mentions the toe-socks
When he melted the zip ties I thought he was going to be excited, he said ow XD
Danny, almost murdering himself trying to cut a Wal-Mart beanie into a mask: And now to cut these socks on my feet into individual toes 🤗
These hacks suck. I know much better ways to kidnap people.
Bro
hi dan
did no one else notice that kurtis is filming-
Danny puffing up his cheeks to make sure the ropes around his torso stayed loose is my favorite thing.
I subscribed and turned on the notifications SO IM TRULY GREG NOW :)
this was so funny
Why are all of them developing stockholm syndrome?
Well I guess 4 layers are the way to go
"If you have a box of matches, you can think of so many games!" Really love to hear a line like that in video content made for children. 👁👄👁
24:24 - 25:13 Istg this whole sequence almost made me pee my pants, so ridiculously funny
Hmmmmm
Did Troom Troom just provide an actually useful life hack?
Danny, during the 2021 pandemic: *cuts a mouth hole into his mask*  ok stevie, this is why you were cursed by the troom troom reindeer cookies
Is that sims 3 music in the background
Omg it's a jojo reference 9:10 and 1:48
danny this is my favorite video you’ve ever made i have not laughed this hard in a long time thank you
why is this the funniest thing i've seen all year
her: snaps the kidnappers neck  me: 👁👄👁 i guess that works.
That wink at 21:47 is doing something to me🥴😂
Danny's Wife: He's probably out cheating Danny:
Original narrator quit cause man that new voice sounds like a man trying to make a girl voice.
my seat flies backwards at 100mph so i can crush bones. avidaderchi losers
Im legally changing my name since my names Skylar.
Danny and Nick: *trying out weird life hacks while being filmed*  Guy: hey that's the best way to be though
NO my younger sister watched one of those vids and she ran up to us later tryna tell us how to kill someone with pressure points on the wrist💀💀
29:30 Bang bang niner gang!!!! we arent having a great season so far.. but still! Faithfull to the bay baby!!!!
i really cant believe the duct tape one worked, that seemed like the least likely one to work
The girl at the start wasn't even tied to the chair she could have just walked out
This might be my favortie video like ever i couldnt stop laughing omg. U and nick need to collab more please <3
"Gotcha girly" didn't think mickey mouse would go from a kids show to kidnapping adults.
e
I learn the same duct tape hack in a survival camp lol
NOOO IM LATE
Sims music on point
Danny's soul leaving his body as he tries to open the velcro LMAOO
If ever there was a time to say," It's not a problem anymore," troom troom now, a kidnapping video would be it.   The matches will never work you need special matches that will strike anywhere.
13:55 WHAT DO YOU MEAN FOR FREE???
Oof
WHY IS SHE WEARING TOE SOCKS
No one:  The narrator: *is mickey mouse*
9:09   I s  T h A t  A  j O j 0   R e F e R e N c E
There people should be arrested
that breathing-in-when-you're-being-tied-up life hack attempt was the hardest i've laughed in a long time
it seems like the narrator and the kidnapper have the same voice does this mean that the kidnapper is the narrator :0
Danny in a dupatta😩👌
when your dad makes you learn how to do the wrist separation thing at 12 bc you’re never safe as a woman 💗💗🤪🤪
as kidnapper myself I can say helped my know what not to do
*cuts tip*  Me: Mazel Tov!
I like how Danny took the time to close the car door before he runs away
This is now my very favourite video of yours. I legit cry laughed three times. Soo good. When you inhaled fluff😂😂😂 . You and Nick have really good comedic chemistry.
10:00
These videos seem like they’re romanticizing Stockholm Syndrome with them not really seem to care that they’re kidnapped and them buying their captors things after they escape, this is fucked up.
22:23 HE LOOKS UNBELIEVABLY PROUD
Dannyyy I love that sweater you got on. Where is it from?
You made a video on this Troom Troom already ..
This was the funniest video I’ve ever seen
I swear the narrator's voice has to be on purpose. Because how could anyone make that video with that narrator and be like "this definitely isn't obnoxious"
Nick is in everyone's house...
Wait that's batman
This video is terrible. I didn't learn any lifehacks about kidnapping people
IS NO ONE GOING TO EXPLAIN THE GIRLS FINGER SOCKS 😭IM CRYING
Wait the random Alexa, was that planned????
Another troom troom video
The tape thing actually works
I can barely manage to strike a match with my hands, let alone my feet.
16:20 your assailant upstaging you by posing for the camera with his new fit is pretty much the best shit ever
I will be honest I had a rhino shield on my phone and dropped the hell out of it and it protected it perfectly!
the toe match game is my favorite game
This is one of the only channels where I actually watch the sponsor segment because it's just as entertaining as the video itself LOL
idk how much of an anime guy you are but there is literally an anime called sleepy princess in a demon castle about a princess who gets kidnapped by a demon king and she isn't even scared or anything she's just constantly bored and just wants to nap. I feel like she's the target audience for this troom troom video
Harry Houdini did that (tensing all of his muscles while a straight jacket was being put on him)
Watching Danny put all that effort into making his toe sock only for Nick to point out that he could just lean over and pick up the match was the funniest thing I've seen all week
tbh kinda suprised people dont know about the duct tape one
Did Troom Troom's narrator voice change??? It sounds way squeaker and grating than before...
The first video was definitely Stockholm syndrome
danny is so funny is almost choked on my cinnamon toast crunch
Troom troom has taught us how to escape a kidnapping, but now they should teach us how to do the kidnapping
Actually the second sketch is based in _some_ fact! Punch out the back car light to get out. Or; If the car has an "Emergency Car Door" lift on the inside, use that!
Even a broken clock can right twice a day Danny.
gocha girly!
Nope, duct tape TOTALLY isn't perforated lol. That's definitely not how they ripped it cleanly.
Nobody: Troom Troom at 3am: ARE YOU GETTING STRANGLED? :)
danny stares very loudly.
Gotcha girlie 🤪
Oh my gosh I cant believe they joke about this. 🤮
Imagine you kidnap someone and they just start watching a troom troom video on their phone
THE FUCKIN SIMS MUSIC AS BACKGROUND MUSIC I-
I only skip ads on Danny's video, everytime in my head i go "haha! no money for you!"
Guys I have no friends so if I will be kidnapped and get somehow free again I will send TV to the kidnappers just because they kidnapped me, and I was not bored :')
This is 30 minutes oh Jesus. Put yo seat belts on fuckers we in for a ride
Nick taller than I thought
12:14 ePafting coPnep
Heeeeeyyyyyy Danny
23:28 oh i thought they brought one 😂
I'm just dying laughing at Danny and Nick together. Nick has no idea what's going on but trying to follow Danny's instructions with that ridiculous hoodie on....I'm literally crying laughing!
do they have a new narrator now? or is the old one just doing her "best" mickey mouse impression
holy shit danny this is probably they funniest video you’ve ever made
Conspiracy theory  Groom Troon workers are secretly a sex trafficking service. Prove me wrong, these videos are meant for demonstration purposes only and the audience is for children.
good one danny
this video is funny
4.38
whgy did the first victim resemble a walking potato??
If you’re lost in the wild with only a bunch of troom troom videos, I think you would be better off just taking your chances instead of trying to do what the video says.
the only time i learned something from this video was at 12:20 when i learned how to plug in my mic correctly because i have the same mic as danny and i had it pointed further down with the cord over the stand 💀
The ducttape one can also be used if you have zipties on your wrists.  I tested that one myself.  Your wrists may get minor cuts but I was able to get out.
well all the actors in the videos are obviously being held captive so....yea I would say that troom troom are kidnappers
You gotta bring nick back again
19:40 why did they move outside? 😂
I think they’re being incredibly irresponsible and dangerous. They should stick to their usual stupid shit and leave this to the professionals.
Someone’s been hitting the tanning beds
I don't know about you guys, but seeing a comically large box and stick propped up as a clear trap definitely fills me with so much fear that I can't even move. Edit: 8:42 Yeah, that's actually a thing. I only remember hearing it about straight jackets, but it is a genuine escape tactic.
the last hack also works with zip tie
These troom troom videos feel like they are trying to get little kids to relate to their captors. Super weird.
5:53 i feel like troom troom stole this bit from 8 out of 10 cats does countdown 😭😭😭
18:04 Danny’s face 😂 like he never thought about it
ugh the narrator forcing their voice into that squeaky baby nightmare sound gives me legit anxiety
Appreciate all the support. I work so hard at my kidnapping skills. It’s always nice to be noticed!!
this is the hardest I've laughed in a good while
"there's our victim!"
Thanks for this masterpiece of a video
It’s the kind of knot you would tie...   You fucking square.
Danny things are starting to get a little wacky
BABE WAKE UP DANNY POSTED
Coward, if your really wanted to prove these worked you’d let yourself get kidnapped. I volunteer to do the kidnapping.
...does anyone wanna tell Danny he is using the wrong kind of matches 😅 TBF, how is anyone supposed to know that there are different types of matches.
omg I love it
Why are you wearing one ankle sock and one crew sock. What is wrong with you.
this is the MOST anoying troom troom narrator I have heard
i'm crying at the ski mask that covers none of nick's face jdfygbksuhdgkf
Danny you’re a good YouTuber
Finally realized I didn't have notifications on. I have turned them on. I am Greg.
So how many layers of duct tape does that hack still work with? Does it take like, ten? Or is it magic and can cut through infinite layers. I know there’s a cool one about how you hold your hands when being zip-tied that allows you to slip them right off, but I don’t remember how to do it.
"arrivederci, losers!" sound like something my autistic sister would say on repeat because she heard it in the newest episode of littlest pet shop
They act like clash royal characters ngl
not danny doing a jim halpert face  23:13
kinky
i actually learned something from this thx danny
That murder dungeon tho...
Okay troom troom is just straight up parodying itself now
Danny looks like off brand batman with his mask on 👌
9:08 I’m getting weird vibes from the Barbie in the bottom left corner. I have a feeling these men want a little more than just ransom. THE WORST PART IS THAT TROOM TROOMS GENERAL DEMOCRATIC IS CHILDREN!!!!!
almost pissed myself omg
Yo. At 12:35, when you cutt out the mouth hole you had me dying. My chest & jaw hurt.
12:19 why is everything tilted to the left??
He says he won’t expose his feet for ‘free’  How much dammit!
Just like imagine being the person that actually takes this seriously and constantly walks around wearing that scarf thing and have all your friends call you like paranoid and stuff like I can’t
this is genuinely one of the funniest videos ive seen in a while
The voice over for the video makes me want to shoot my ears of
25:33 Not the 40 year old white man jog
OMG Costa Rica! I’m Costa Rican!
Kidnappers after seeing this video oh well
Ill have to try these next time
this was amazing
Why tf does she have gems on her face
9:10 just a naked Mancunian in the background
why are u making videos with him :|
The last hack is supposed to work for zip ties around the wrists too
9:11 omfg 😂
There’s always an alexa lol
I was expecting the hacks to be "bedazzle your gun with stickers and flames so your bullets hit the criminals faster"
Gotcha girly🤓
3:08 WHY ARE HER SOCKS LIKE THAT HELP
just started the video, but oh my gawd the sims music. my nostalgia. it pains me.
How disgusting to make fun of these extremely, helpful hacks 🤮. This could actually spread misinformation. Can’t believe you could do something like that 🤬🤬.
Arrivederci, losers!
24:30 acting? phenomenal, romance? started
Hey Danny that's a cool sweatshirt
low budget mythbusters lmao
Just don't get kidnapped bozo
This video got me laughing blind lmao I can't open my eyes 😂
The background seems brighter for some reason
The most curse thing I see is the sox
I love this video
These troom troom kidnapping videos are so stupid they are making getting kidnapped seem like a good thing you wanna know what actually comes from kids and women being kidnapped abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and especially sexual abuse assault and rape getting kidnapped is not really something you should joke about it’s serious and traumatizing and happens more often than we think
I can't believe I'm saying this but I miss the old troom troom narrator
If the match thing worked properly, wouldn’t your foot catch on fire?
We are Greg and we are taking over the internet!
5:58 😂
This video is so goofy and good at the same time, I laughed my ass off even tho I tried really really hard to keep quiet since it's late night now
"this time I've got fabric glue, I'm not about to burn myself" cut to a day later him holding a match to his wrists
You have to swing your arms down and pull your hands apart from eachother to break the tape
How did you get so funny?
what a great birthday gift. ty for this danny. i love it.
the way u have sims 3 music as ur background music
“Rhino collabs with NASA”, Danny ; YOU discovered it was public domain to use 🤣🤣
Haha !!!
Kidnapping is so common in Russia there's etiquette for it that includes giving your captors gifts.
Please do more collabs with Nick!! Y’all are so funny together
haha                                                                haha
Help lemme go, Help lemme go
Am I the only one who got anxiety when he dropped his phone at the end?
yeah the duct tape one is an actual technique that self-defence trainers and police teach so troom troom actually gave some good advice for once lol
Their voices become higher and more saccharine with each video.
This was clearly a joke video🤦🏽‍♂️
R U getting strangled???🕵😲😱😨😠😡😧😧😈
Nobody: Absolutely no one: Troom troom: yay I’m getting kidnapped
pov: is using a new TV and new PS5 as props in order to claim them as business expenses from their videos
Hi
Looks everywhere but Amazon? Pages and pages of toe socks...
1:30 omfg the narrator 😂
21:48 low key unexpectedly turn on by that wink lmao
Troom Troom doesn’t know the first thing about this stuff. All you have to do is scream, “Help, let me go!”
DANNY ARE YOU A 49ERS FAN?
I absolutely cannot stand the narrators voice. It's so annoying. Like intentionally as annoying as possible.
*NOW IM GOING TO CRUSH YOUR BONES*
I'm legit impressed with the duct tape "hack".
Hi cream
“I felt like I was choking you.” “You were.” That got me.
I miss the old troom troom narrator lol
don't they mean push out while being tied up so you can suck in and your ropes or chains will be lose enough to wiggle out?
Danny bout to hit 5 mil 🥰
Plot twist: Danny's camera person is an actual kidnapper and has forced Danny and Nickisnotgreen to do this video
Toe socks wow
if i were a kidnapper and i had to use tape id use pacaging tape
It's physically impossible for a human to snap someone's neck like that. In order to snap someone's neck u would need the strength of a gorilla
Nick didn’t understand your comedic pausing
one thing i know about this kidnapper is that he’s not green
I'm so happy to see Nick supporting and guest staring small channels like Danny's.
If you get kidnapped, literally just wake up. It's that easy
The narrator makes me want to commit lego step, and I thought my voice cracks were bad..
NICKK???????/ :|
The narrator to these videos has a voice equivalent to the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard
Is that nickisnotgreen? On camera not being political? I've missed you buddy 🥺
Man this video was good
I learned hack #4 from Alexis Rose.
I'm not see George in you video ha
Why is the voice over for the channel so annoying holy hell
Looking a bit grey in the hair Danny
nick and danny collab nick and danny collab nick and danny collab. two of my favorite youtubers are collabing again woop woooppppp
Is it bad I was almost in tears of laughter at the parts where poor Nick had to tie him up or choke him, oh mannn
I'm glad you rented out this garage
WHY DO HER SOCKS HAVE TOES
Danny and Nick are two people who i have no clue how tall they are
He found his password again lol
They found a more annoying voice
Brb buying duct tape to try this
AWWWW Nick!!!!! Great vid you guys! :D
13:56 what if we pay you
Is Troom another word for Troll  😬😬??
Life Hack: LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR
"Skylar better watch her step" hit me personally
Next time I’m taken to a lame boring well lit dungeon I’ll be sure to look to troom troom videos for advice
:Now i crush his bones" i couldnd breathe
Holy shit, real talk, i know troom troom was bad but painting being kidnapped as a fun, light-hearted experience is just π√#@*)
I feel like every time Danny goes to a party now, he's gonna be like "Hey, wanna see something cool? I brought duct tape!"
So no ones gonna talk about that wink? 21:46
Actual advice if you're wearing zip-ties :  If you wear shoes with laces, untie your shoes and thread one lace through the middle of your wrists. Then, tie the laces to the opposite foot. Once it's done, move your legs as if you were pedaling a bike as fast as you can. This will "burn" the ties and they will break apart.
I think with the, uh, /scotch/ tape one, you’re supposed to hit your wrists against your knee to help break it the tape. That’s what I’ve seen and heard.
why does the narrator sound like she's trying to do a mickey mouse impression
That tape trick actually does work. But you don’t have to “strain” your body. Just press your arms together as hard as you can, raise them above your head, and then pull down and apart as fast as you can.
You got nice skin... For a youtuber
Yes, Danny. Snapping someone’s neck can kill them.
This is very easily one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen
The voiceover is so annoying it's unbelievable
Me: Sir i got hot glue can i leave? Kidnapper: Sure have a nice day Me: Arrivederci!
"How to escape kidnappers" narrated by Missy from Big Mouth.
WHY DO THE SOCKS HAVE TOES AAAAAAHH
love how nicks getting more popular
Half a million views in five hours.... Man is KILLING it.
nick is so adorable...
the narrators say the translation mistakes so casually
My dumbass thought it said kindergarten and not kindnapping and was so confused by the intro
god this video is hilarious
5:53 I won’t be surprised if I see that in the next SimpliSafe commercial
This shows that you haven’t watch Project Mc2 🙄 I used to think about the scotch tape trick every day
" are you getting strangled? "  WHY WAS IT SO CASUAL I CANT
One of the best videos in awhile
when i went to a self defense class for one of my friends birthdays they taught us the duct tape trick. they also taught us how to get out of zip ties by tying our shoelaces inside of the zip ties and doing the bicycle really hard, and the zip ties just popped right off.
I was watching this on my TV and when he asked Alexa what that one phrase meant at 23:29 it activated my Alexa and it actually gave me the term 🤣
I've actually seen escape artists suggest you should break out of duct tape the same way you did in the video. But the Troom Troom video didn't exactly explain how to do it properly by raising your arms overhead, then swiftly swing your arms to the ground while spreading your wrist and elbows apart
On the off chance you see this, thanks for making a funny video!  It's been a rough week and I really needed something to laugh at.
Hasan & Ethan and now Danny and Nick all my favorite YouTubers are collabin
Why the run THE SAME 25:33
Nick panicking that he’s actually choking Danny while he’s literally choking Danny killed me
Please this was so funny😭😭
Who is ur friend, I want more of him, lol
"guns don't kill people criminals kill people"                  ~danny Gonzales 2021
UwU
This video was made for those "Kidnapped by One Direction" fiction writers.
hack #3 was my favorite scene it felt so authentic tryiing to play off the scarf, looking at the camera, the choking & having your friend go back behind your seat to be "crushed" lol also racing out of the car to run away
You know that Netflix movie Bird Box, where people see monsters as their worst fears and then kill themselves.  If I was in Bird Box, the monster I saw would have the voice of the Troom Troom Narrator.
Danny Gonzalez troom troom videos better be archived for the future generations
I knew that duct tape strategy worked, but for some reason it looked like nick and danny were doing it WAY too slow to tear it so I was still surprised everytime lmao
ig they should be called "death hacks" then
I wanted to type a large paragraph analysing every part that was funny, but I realized, this whole video is. There were like 20 times where I rewinded a few secs to rewatch a joke haha.   Seriously one of the funniest videos I've ever seen.
"Are you psycho" -Danny Gonzales  Idk what year
Arrivederci means "see you later" for anyone interested
The narrator’s inflections makes me want to be dead
If my life was narrated by troom troom I would kill myself
this video would be 1 minute long if any of the kidnapping victims just had that one tiktok audio saved..
"they're legally not allowed to chase you"  that's.... actually true I think, like that's harassment or sumn
Is that sims music in the background?
So that duct tape thing worked because duct tape is designed to rip when force is applied from two different directions (in this case, out and at a diagonal). It works regardless of the number of layers of duct tape because each layer will rip individually with the force. It also works on zip ties but you have to apply physical pressure from another source -- so you can break out if you slam the zip ties against your thigh while also pulling out and at a diagonal (though it does hurt).
Danny Gonzalez the "tree frog" shirt you wore in this  "trying troom troom's awful kidnapping life hacks" is the same shirt you wore in funny/goofy video "I made a viral tik tok song" while trying to get a few famous tik tok stars...
I’m sure you could write an entire PhD dissertation weighing the arguments for whether or not Troom Troom is satire.
17:12 - 17:22 too good
That ductape hack is a free ticket for breaking or dislocating your wrists. Don't do that ppl
Dudes can't pay for or find a TV, yet they have a PS5. That plot hole was covered up with a blade of grass.
I like that he rented a garage for this. I imagine the application was like “for what use” and he wrote “testing out kidnapping hacks”. Or possibly they said “garage rental, no questions asked”.
"they mean business, THIS TIME," 🤣🤙🏾
“god get out of my throat”
It’s the kinda square u tied u fuckin knot
I had someone wrap like 10 layers of duct tape around my arms, from my wrist like halfway up to my elbows bc they didn't believe it would work, and it snapped so easily using that technique
Hello I am Greg have you hit the Greg button yet. If not please hit the Greg button
Hello I am Greg have you hit the Greg button yet. If not please hit the Greg button
ayo she said the jojo thing
why is nobody talking about the alexa that part was so funny
These are very useful skills 😉
Yaaaayy kidnapping hacks! I intend to be kidnapped next week. Plenty of time to train 😃
It *is* all about ambiance.
is that .... SIMS 3 CAS MUSIC at the start of the video??
the sims 3 music in the background of the video really got me, specially because I was playing the sims 3 while watching this video. the whole time I was like "huh??? why is there music?? I thought I was on live mode????"
28:19 the WTF when it works a second time
17:32 So getting kidnapped turns you into...a mosquito?
the tapestry at 23:28 is the same tapestry that's hanging beside me
Dang here I thought I was being taught how to kidnap. I’ve been scammed
These videos are honestly better to learn how kidnapped people will escape from my car
Very funny, Danny. Keep it up.
I just wanted to say I have the same exact pair of scissors as you.
Troom Troom narrator sounds like a Disney Princess gone nuts...... It's annoying
I laughed every time Danny made the square knot joke. This video was so good
This is like Troom Troom/Life-Hack Mythbusters and I need more of it in my life
I knew the ducktape one was real because I saw it on a Try Guys's video.
PRAY TO END ABORTION!!! God bless u!!!❤️❤️❤️👼👼
it was nice of nick to come and be in danny's video and help support a smaller creator 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I absolutely hate the new troom troom narrator
24:58 Danny regaining his composure after almost getting strangled “okay. Now I crush his bones”
i'm being kidnapped! * *the sims 3 ost plays in the background* *
Cheeseburger
Your expression at 7:18 said it all. That's the whole video.
The way Dan cut the beanie, it defeated the purpose of trying to hide lol
Rite Aid is the only store that has toe socks but only seasonally. Like right now there are four different types of Halloween-ish toe socks and then same for Christmas and Valentine’s Day.  I feel this pain.  I feel I may be the only one who understands this very specific toe~sock~pain. It is real.     *~^~Be warned however, they are not the best looking ... except for the Valentine’s Day socks and one pair of the Halloween socks. they do last a long time though , and like so they only come around  for  these three holidays-ish-seasonal-time-periods. and that’s it.   it vexes me to a degree that I cannot verbally <redacted>.
honestly loved this video
It’s a fish all. I’m greg
DANNY THIS VIDEO IS SO FUNNY LOVE U
HELP LET ME GO!!!!
I thought the title was about how to kidnap
Vintage sweatshirt on point danny
i cant stand the goddamn knock off micky mouse narrator's voice im sorry i cant even watch this video
I'm glad he actually got the duct tape "hack" to work, because that's an actual thing that's taught to people at things like self-defense classes. There's also one on how to break zip ties around your wrists. I swear I've seen Mark and Ethan do something similar in [REDACTED]. Either way, it's good information to know!
That’s a dope sweatshirt. Where’d you get it?
About the moment with calling duct tape a scotch tape. In Russia (I suppose in Ukraine is happening the same) we usually use scotch tape. We even use scotch when we talk about other tapes, like masking tape is called "painters scotch". And as for duct tape, it also usually called scotch
Lets together kidnap.
I feel like I’ve heard about the duct tape “hack” for so long now- I thought it was common knowledge you can snap duct tape 😂
Bro I'm so smart, I watched Project MC Squared so I learned the duct tape thing from the cool spy girls.
Daddy Danny: the next time you need toe socks (and we all know you’ll need toe socks again) go to your local Claire’s, or novelty store (Spencer’s Gifts, It store, etc) for toe socks.  And sweet bracelets.
Danny did you dye your hair and then put a hat on
ARRIVEDERCI LOSERS
Love u Danny
9:08 did no one notice the naked mannequin in the corner?
maybe troom troom are actually expert sociologists which is how they know crime is rooted in societal issues so they choose to address the root causes of crime and advise you to buy your kidnappers a PlayStation
Ok the neck snapping part came out of nowhere
The worst part that it is most effective lifehack video troom troom made.
5:37 actually guns don’t kill people, bullets kill people
“Ahh he’s back”
Aren’t their videos for kids, I don’t think teaching kids how to snap necks and then showing them fine afterwards is okay lmao
the reason the duct tape hack works is because duct tape is very strong lengthwise, but weak crosswise, which is why you can tear a piece off with your hands
Danny that's my shirt why do you have my shirt give it back
danny…you look good in this video because of your hair
Dude in the yellow shirt literally got reversed Stockholm syndrome
1:25 they should have put a hamburger under the box
My favorite video you’ve ever made
I have never seen matches that long they're usually small like inches away from your finger
glad that troom troom is teaching kids that being kidnapped is a fun thing to happen to women that ends in new friendships (/s)
can we walk about the toe socks that she had on?????
Safety matches can't light on walls.  That's the safety part (you need strike anywhere matches)
brb gotta tape my wrists now
by "kidnapping hacks" i thought they were going to give us tips on how to kidnap people
"are you tied up in scotch tape?" "perfect!"
i miss the old troom troom narrator voice tbh
Why wa she voice so hight gotCHA GIrle
He said he wouldn’t show his feet for FREE.  Ok fine. How much??
Actually amazing that after all this we got some actually good advice
2021 Oct 10
Cursory glance at the comments suggests that nobody has answered this yet, so let me be the first. No, you can't just reach back and snap someone's neck from a disadvantaged position. The body mechanics are all wrong. You wouldn't know it watching tv and movies, where people go around snapping necks like it's nothing, but it isn't really that simple. There would be far fewer people out there doing judo, jujitsu, wrestling, or playing American football if the human neck were that fragile.
Yay!! I always love the bad troom troom videos xxx
Stockholm Syndrome?
wtf was that 9:26
Wait, did you also buy a Tesla for yourself??
I need a “criminals are guns” shirt
The "scotch" tape hack is actually so effective, I tried and it works with hair bands too I wouldn't be surprised if you could do it with a zip tie
The narrator sounds like a Mickey Mouse wannabe
If you were going to snap someone’s neck and kill them you’d need a lot more power behind it
3:48 tbh this looks more than a hand than a foot
Why is the Troom Troom vid narrated by dollar store Marge Simpson
I wish you just used the Santa hat mask from “I’m gonna kill Santa clause”😂
5 minute kidnaps
This video was VERY goofy
10:01 so what if he had a leather belt?
The narrator sound like Squidward and a nasal infection had a baby😭😂😭😂
the narrator of troom troom sounds like she's on the verge of having a voice crack
Danny is my best friend in real life, and he won’t respond to this comment to deny it, so you can’t tell me otherwise
i think i have that same tv.
Danny escapes with bondage with the power of hamon
11:47 Nock-off jojo reference.
🗿
Danny getting choked is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.  Sounds way darker than I thought
Not the romanticism of getting kidnapped...
Are we just going to ignore the fact that with that hack or the guard is playing with matches the girl had neon orange toe socks on?
The narration is SO obnoxious
gunmetal grey isn't the color of gunmetal
Danny burns epicly
omg hi nick! good to see you!
The way the narrator says "Martin" makes me CRINGE!
you should review this movie "jungle shuffle" its so bad its funny
i am dying
D-Does Danny not know about strike-anywhere matches? Cause those were definitely strike-on-box...   You wouldn't be able to light those off the wall cause there's no phosphorus on the matchhead, only sulfur. The little strip on the box is phosphorus which lights the match when it hits the sulfur with enough friction. Strike-anywhere matches have both sulfur and phosphorus in the head so you just need friction.  Danny had strike-on-box matches, he wouldn't have been able to light them off the wall at all, that's why he was struggling with it during the zip tie hack.
Toe-socks are a sin
THE LONG AWAITED NEWEST INSTALLMENT OF THE TROOM TROOM SERIES
pro tip! are you being kidnapped from behind? bring up your leg and kick backwards! kick their kneecap if you can, or just their shin because shin guards exist in soccer for a reason. They’ll let go of you (because it’ll hurt, if they don’t just do it again till they do) and then bring your hands to their head, grab the hair (or mask if they’re bald) and smash their face into your knee. then, only then, can you run.  TL;DR being physically assaulted? attack them back.
Danny you look like you are slower than nick
nicks hair poking out of the ski mask is sending me
25:10 Haha, that’s what you get for buying expensive new cars 😂 you don’t get to crush your friends’ bones
are we not gonna talk about the mannequin in the background of the chain video...
If Louder with Crowder gets demonetized for spreading misinformation, Troom Troom should be completely de-platformed
Somehow the Troom Troom voice lady got more annoying.
the hack where u breath in when ur getting tied up is actually an option but they didnt come up with it
FINALLY
Plot twist: it's actually a life hacks for kidnappers
I think we need more of his kidnapper in his videos. Nick not Green
i genuinely thought it was gonna be a troom troom skit about how to kidnap people
Can I just ask why Minnie Mouse is narrating this whole thing? Wtf is up with that lmao
forget about wearing the scarf, just check the back seats of your car. better yet, lock the damn thing.
No one: Absolutely no one: Troom Troom:   *a r e   y o u   b e i n g   s t r a n g l e d ? ?*
The matches didn't light on the wall because they were safety matches. You have to specifically buy non-safety matches to be able to strike them on the wall to light them.
🤬NO END SONG AGAIN!!!
Awful WHAT hacks
Danny back with the troom troom vids🔥
12:10 i thought he was gonna say "my big day tomorrow as in the day I'm getting kidnapped" 😭😭✋
The entire part where he’s making the ski mask is KILLING ME
did you get a new cam
it's all fun and games until a child actually believes this, gets in this situation and thinks this will help, this is going to get someone injured or worse. god fuck youtube for promoting this dangerous content and having no policy against it.
stockholm syndrome
Danny gonalz
Arrivederci means goodbye in Italian I have never cringed so hard than I did when I watched them butcher that word
I’m literally laughing out loud
This is Nick’s revenge for what happened to his cat on the server.
Matches that light against surfaces thay aren't match boxes  arent made anymore
The “aRe YoU gEtTiNg StRaNgLeD?!” at the beginning is all I needed
God the voice over in the beginning was so extremely high pitched that it makes me want to clear my throat so bad lmao
The square knot comment is my new favorite 😂
this couldn't cross my mind, but narrator is worse than the older videos
no one’s gonna mention the sims 3 build mode music?
Why does it sound like it's being voiced by missy from bigmouth on Adderall
STOP SAYING ALEXA LOL
The narrators voice over is grading my ears. her voice fluctuates so much. Why is she forcing it so much.
11:29 it does work, it just requires a lot of strength
wild
I was kidnapped once by this older guy who lived 3 houses down he would always give me ice cream and taught me how to tie my shoe. Once he earned my trust he invited me in to get the ice cream myself and kept me there till dark and turns out he was on Megan’s law so obviously they searched his house and found me the same day (7-8) hours later. I was fine and didn’t even realize anything was wrong we played with all the toy trains he had.
nick: Are you ok? 🤨 danny: I’m kidnapped, of course I’m not okay 🙄  I’m scared 😉😏  PLSS 😭😭
The worst part of this, is when they give toe sock a purpose. Not a good one, but a purpose none the less.
IMAGINE IF SOMEONE TRIES THIS they would be dead
Please react to American justice warriors
3:08 is nobody gonna talk about how her sock separates her toes like that? wtf
13:27 woah is that spider man
Nice wink you've got there danny
the end of the cool hair danny era
This is a completely normal video. Just guys being dudes. Tying their bros up
19:06 Cavemen be like:
Danny having a self-portrait of him drinking milk is not only weird, crazy and narcissistic but also the coolest wall decor I’ve ever seen and I want it.
Guess I can’t kidnap Danny now.
why does the troom troom narrator sound like a bad impression of mickey mouse
23:13 is that Jim halperts signature look
Never knew wearing toe socks could be such a tactical choice.
The fact I hate myself for knowing what arreviderci means only because I watched jojo hurts bro
Did they specifically tell the voiceover girl to be extra annoying for this one because I am actually getting a headache from this
I love to think that the die hard troom troom fans watched this video and that’s why there is 186 dislikes
Why does the narrator sound like some sort of Disney character? 😂
"Breathe in and tense all of your muscles while you are being tied up" Isn't that what horses do when you're putting the saddle on to try to get you to make it looser?
Need a horror edit series for these  Troom is perfect idea for a creepshow like series
This video was hilarious, loved it!!!!
19:22 that guy is a wolf in all level but physical
Nick being so unimpressed by whatever is happening needs to be in every video
When you're black beanie from Walmart is made of asbestos
Ahaha he didn't want to show off his feet but  he made peekaboo socks, the most alluring kind
For your duck tape hack, use hand sanitizer to slide your hands through the duck tape.
*gets kidnapped and taken to a dungeon*  “Ugh I’m so bored…”
nick, danny, and troom troom. what a wonderful video.
Subscribed with notifications on !!! Am I truly GREG now ??
Is it just me, or is it uncomfy seeing a kids channel talk so casually about kidnapping? I feel like this could send a dangerous message to kids.
ive heard the duct tape one from a cop or smth its pretty cool that it works
Lol the scarf both dooms and saves you 😂 duct tape not scotch tape! Lmao 🤣 i love you Danny!!
Wow, what a clown. Centaurs are obviously odd-toed ungulates, but the sock has a split down the middle, meaning he’s definitely pulling up as an odd-toed ungulate. Buffoon
12:52 Meet the Spy
9:20 I’m sorry but is that a s3x doll?
danny you almost have 5 million subscribers why the fuck are you wearing sketchers
7:24 something like that is real. Stockholm syndrome is a a form of ptd where hostages of criminals find themselves bonding with their captors during hostage situations and even going as far as defending them in court
I used to be afraid of kidnap😳😣Now thanks to Danny Troom Troom collab I can escape kidnap 💯🙏🏻 🔛🔝
You gotta get strike anywhere matches brother they got the white tip
we need to see more of the crafting corner
I love how at 11:15 after asking whether you’re tied up with “scotch tape”. They literally say “perfect”
Everyone’s just gonna ignore how insanely long those matches were?? I was half expecting Danny’s sock to catch on fire lmao
They couldn't of got a different narrator for these videos?😂😂
whats up greg
For the second one you should actually breathe out when he’s tying you up so when he leaves you can breathe in and its a lot looser
Nick and Danny are so funny together omg I haven’t laughed this much in a while!
Chains ✅ rope ✅ friend to tie me up ❎
Heres an actual life hack that will work : do what the kidnappers say
Troomtroom is VERY out-of-touch LOL 😂
This video is so poggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
as someone who has experience with kidnapping people, i can confirm that these life hacks may save ur life. i can vividly remember one of my captives shooting me after i left them untied and alone in a room full of firearms.
18:38 prob because we are used to dan-dans crap lol
cool vid
Please… I need to rep my Chicago pride where can I find that sweater, Danny. I need it in my life.
I love you GREG!
"Looking like a centaur" .. hahaha 😂
AAAH, HE'S BACK!
danny stop watching me
I'm losing IQ points.
Danny's vids are HILARIOUS
The way Troom Troom is glorifying kidnapping in this one is really gross and disturbing,,,, not good for kids to be watching
Seriously that duct tape one made me angry, even angrier when it WORKED?! WHAT
12:13
Knowing that the duct tape would work, watching Danny’s absolute disbelief was incredible
13:55 Whatever your price is Danny, I'll send you a blank check
Dan and Phil? 👎 Danny and Phil: the glue cap boys 👍
11:08
I'm loosing it Danny is playing the Sims 3 soundtrack??? ngl I thought I left my game open or summat
how does this have 178 dislikes smh trrom troom bots 100%
The scariest thing about this whole thing is that when someone actually does get kidnapped and tries to think back to this, the only things that will come to mind is that screechy baby voice and that pumpkin head
I knew the duct tape/zip tie wrist thing & that it’s real. Where I’m from, that is a common self-defense tip that most women know. This video was hilarious, but now I’m pondering self-defense knowledge that is pervasive among women that men probably don’t know because the threat level is generally not the same.
This is my favorite Danny video of the year. I'm loving Danny discovering how duct tape works 😆
i just realized you look like balloony from pnf
Not me thinking this video was testing hacks of how to kidnap someone
As a fellow with a car seat that moves electronically...my attacker would have to be very patient to be "crushed" by it.   Even then...I think it has a sensor to not crush children.   This car was built in 2008.  I bet by now they have a "Hey, bro, there's a dude in your back seat...watch out for that!" Alarm in Teslas, Lexux, Mercs, BMWs, Infinitis, Cadillacs, Hondas, potatoes, a tree, my dog, an entire McDonalds' store, squirrels, and so on...and anything that has been improved after 2006.
!it's scary when troom troom yells "get in car"
10:05 My car has a motorized seat, so it’s just kinda just be like: “…hold on, wait for about uh… 10 seconds… YEAH GET YOUR BONES POWDERED FUCK YEAH”
Mad dot her win 4 hours
Accidentally paused at 4:43. And it looks like a scene from an adult film...
stockholm syndrome moment
The first girl’s voice in the Troom Troom video sounded like she was going through puberty and was held at -gun- criminal point.
As a girl who's constantly worried about being kidnapped I actually knew that "scotch" tape hack before this video, it's really handy for everyone to know!
That duct tape thing did not come from Troom Troom. I’ve seen that from other self defence instructors. But Troom Troom didn’t do the instructions as clearly as I’ve seen. Plus the reason it worked probably was because it wasn’t really from them.
7:57 Remember, if the kidnappers leave the car and aren't back in 15 minutes. You're legally allowed to leave.
9:07 is anyone gonna mention the naked mannequin in the background?
Danny I need your help, YouTube nsfw bots are stalking me! I'm serious, no joke
I only clicked on this video because I thought he was gonna try there life hacks on how to kidnap
Lol there was an Alexa 😂
Lol
When that girl was in the car trunk I thought she was gonna pull a JJ Bitenbinder move where you punch through the back car lights.
yes
i- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAST NARRATOR?? BRING HER BACK HER VOICE WAS BETTER WHERES TROOM TROOM I WANT ANSWERS
8:33 I'm so in love with the voice acting in these videos, like, "they mean _🅱️uisness_ this TIme, thEhY have *cHAINS* "
Danny my bf dont know about you. WHAT SHOULD I DO
...Did you get like the worst matches in the world?
The face he made from seeing the dutch tape hacks was hilarious😂
Danny, you need to do more than troll TROOM TROOM.  This is garbage.
wouldn’t this be extremely offensive to kidnapping survivors?
Troom Troom has the weirdest, craziest, most unrealistic narrated situations/story lines.
28:26 scared me bc it said matches are fun to play with you can burn your self and die with them their not fun.
Feels like this video was made by kidnappers
I think there was this one show on discovery channel or smth that actually has that hack of breaking a duct tape like that like there's some science behind it sooo that thing really works
I kinda wanna know why your wife wouldn’t want to tie you up and leave lmao
Am so weak🤣🤣🤣🤣diying
I liked the video, but why do you have sims music in the background
Anyone notice how all the people getting kidnapped are women? Just me...? It's like TroomTroom is making fun of sex trafficking or something. Kinda gross! Kidnapping is a serious problem.
At first I thought this meant hacks on how to kidnap someone.
Imma be honest. I thought that Troom Troom was giving you tips and tricks on how to kidnap people. And I wasn't even surprised
Why do those criminals sound like Mickey Mouse 😂
Why is Ralph Wiggum their narrator lol
Life hack: don’t get kidnapped in the first place
I’m too high for this 😭🤣
i think the tape thing was in an unus annus video.
The Criminal family portrait: the perfect couple's Halloween 2021 costume!!! ( If he says no, I'll kidnap him- he'll be powerless cuz he doesn't watch TroomTroom! Heh heh heh...😈
This is dumb but lowkey so entertaining kkk
The creepiest thing in this video about kidnappings is the Alexa responding when Danny jokingly called out an Alexa question
Are we just gonna ignore that the door at 3:39 was unlocked? She could have escaped without getting out of the zip ties.
I genuinely thought troom troom was teaching people *how to kidnap someone* as opposed to escaping-
Huh, nice
For me I know that the 123 GO! Is bad to but Troom Troom is scary so yeah 👍
"Get out of my throat" -Danny 2021
Watching him make the mask so incredibly wrong, shows how absolutely unfit for crime this man is. Good for you, Danny
LMAO the square knot bit got me twice
The people watching troom troom make these videos: 👁👄👁
Danny almost looks like the bully in any highschool movie
Wow its so great that Emily watches troom troom and knows a life hack
The first one is just abduction play 😅
now this video am i right????
here’s some actual advice for if someone tries choking you from behind take the seat belt if your able to get some space between whatever item it is loop it through and put it on your foot straighten your leg and lay the seat back. it’ll get you some space to get your head out n leave. and by on ur foot i mean by ur toes where it’s easily to get off
Arrivederci losers! Mamma mia...
Nick is longer than I thought she is.
This is the hardest i’ve laughed in a while😂
I knew the duct tape one was real bc when Unus Annus existed, they did a video of (actual) escaping hacks lmao
7:51 As a car nut I know why there car broke down they there car overheated and look at the engine like is this magic what happening
Nick is not green, but Nick *is* tall???
Danny reminds me of a grandma in a 20 year olds body so much
Love-Handle is at 2:03
Danny said he wasn't going to show his bare feet... For free. Interesting.
aRe YoU gEtTiNg StRaNgLeD¿
Is this narrated by Minnie Mouse
dude that narrator voice alone makes me cringe. how do people legit watch this for entertainment? not danny of course we love you lol
The first video is beauty and the beast 2
Came for Danny, stayed for the sims 3 music in the background
is the narrator minnie mouse
so troom troom taught you the duck tape escape life hack? No, that one show about smart girls called mc squared taught me
they are going to kidnap you or should i say adultnap you
The narrator in the first one sounds like the "When will you learn that your actions have CONSEQUENCES?!" kid
are yall playin the toe match game ova ere?
I haven't laughed this much in months, Danny and Nick are comedy heaven. I definitely hope you two make more videos together.
the breathe in method is used by magicians to escape from straightjackets
I can't stop laughing XD
i almost lost it when the guy yelled "GRRRRARBARBARB
Stockholm Syndrome: The Netflix adaptation
You know that weird feeling you get after waking up from a nap where everything seems odd? That feeling is called TroomTroom.
You an nick lmao
yo, the duct tape was a pog moment
I’ve been legit kidnapped before and troom trooms videos and skits about it legit piss me off 😐 love your video though 💜
Oh god how I’ve missed those lifeless eyes
Petition for Danny to watch no gun no life
those are actually balaclavas, just bad ones
The ducktape hack is actually a pretty good way to injure yourself! Better to get some floss and saw through or use any available liquid to lubricate your wrists
O
TroomTroom is that kid that says "if I was ever kidnapped, the kidnappers would just bring me back bc Im so annoying LOLOLOLOL"  like, no troomtroom. theyre going to kill you.
I'll most definitely use these life hacks in the future 😮‍💨
hey danny you seem to be a fan of many Chicago teams.. are you a Chicagoan?
🔫👋🏻😐👈🏻 “you mean like this?” “Ah he’s back!”
Danny, why didn't you buy your friend a TV to thank him for his hard kidnapping work?
The narrator sounds so squeaky
I literally cried tears laughing at the scarf not splitting, and seeing Danny legitimately struggle more than he assumed he would
3:37 wait who’s holding the match???
"since when are criminals good at crafts?" this is Martha Stewart ERASURE!!
My first thought by the title: *kidnapping hacks?*
This is probably my favorite video from you
Troom Troom Gives Me PTSD, omg
what a fucking wild notification to get and then the THUMBNAIL??
I’m no kidnapper but shouldn’t you try to keep your name a secret from the person you kidnapped just in case they escaped?
”Are you tied up with scotch tape?” No it’s duct tape… His deadpan delivery made me laugh
The troom troom narrator's voice makes it genuinely difficult to watch this video. Are they trying to be at grating as humanly possible?
We REQUIRE more videos with music videos at the end of them. As a criminal, who is a gun, I'm PREPARED to do something illegal and weird to make it happen.
I cant wait until TroomTroom teaches me how to escape capital punishment
Imagine Jaycee Duncan or Elizabeth Smart coming across this Troom Troom video. I think Dannys commentary is funny but the overall content of the original video that is obviously aimed towards children is wildly inappropriate.I just really don't feel like content like that should be aimed to kids it's gross
Had no idea troom trooms narrator could get even more annoying :')
Nick should be a motivational speaker 27:23
😂 being tied up had never been so funny
Ah yes, when I’m being kidnapped I obviously would immediately think about Troom Troom
Danny’s fashion sense upgraded 🫁
In the first one Skyler has stolkholm syndrome
bruh, i came here for advice and left with nothing helpful. waste of time
Why did that “got ya girly” kind of sounded like tod Flanders from Simpsons
Wait... have they changed the troom troom voiceover person?
2:49 apparently *SOMEONE* hasn’t been watching their Smoky the Bear commercials 🙄😒
Real life hack: while being tied up, put your wrists facing down if they’re together, then once your hands are tied you can put your wrists together and slide your hands out
foot fetish safety precaution
This video is HILARIOUS bruh I deadass watched it again after I finished it. This is my new favorite video now
"Thank you all for gathering here today to remember Danny Gonzalez.  He died how he lived, in a bitchin' Tesla."
I legit surprised that the duct, um, scotch tape thing worked.
the whole "i could just go get a rope" "no, uh,, no i think you would just use a scarf" bit killed me
who created these wtf lol
With the duct tape trick if you do that motion but do like a Muay Thai knee into the spot in-between your wrists it works (works significantly better with zip ties than duct tape but can work with duct tape too) my friends and I tested this is highschool
I have never been so excited in my entire life
* hears the sims 4 background music* ah delightful beginning of suffering :)
Nickisnotgreen?? You are a kidnapper??
9:17 as someone who takes Martial Arts, the best move is grab their arms, bend over forward the farthest you can, while still standing. This can be hard for smaller skinner people but if you use your back and send all your strength to your legs, it should fling them over your head. Which they would let go to brace themselves (a natural reflex) then you can make a break for it.
This should not have made me laugh as hard as it did
🧿
So modern matches don't let you use walls or other materials to light them anymore. Matches used to have the material on the matchbox you use to light the match on the actual match itself, and by applying friction you could mix the two and cause the reaction that lights the match, but nowadays they put one material on the box, and one on the match, meaning you can't just strike it on a wall. Although I suspect it may be different wherever Troom Troom is based, as they seem to be someone in Eastern Europe, and they don't have a good grasp on English, so my guess is Russia or nearby countries with similarly lax safety standards for things.
Lil Wayne in the hot tub
Danny has the worlds creepiest basement and still went to an external location to film 🤷
i cant get over the alexa part
more plz
Honestly Rhinoshield is the best phone case I’ve ever used in my entire adult life
Ok but is it just me or is the narrator in the first video way more annoying sounding
Dungeon? More like dumbgeon. Side note,  I can 100% tell you're danny Gonzalez with the mask on lol
That voiceover girl sounds like she is making fun of the old voiceover girl 🤣  Scratch that!! Just listening to her gave me a headache😩(the VO girl at the very beginning)
I already knew the duct tape trick and when Danny tried the first time to do it all I could think was “ PULL YOUR ARMS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER!” Glad him and Nick figured it out!
Is that criminal suffering reverse Stockholm Syndrome?
How much you wanna bet this was created by Russian mafia ties and is targeted towards wealthy/High ranking politicians kids to make them easier to kidnap by showing that it’s fun to be kidnapped.
danny needing help from his kidnapper to do the hacks is iconic
I don't need Troom Troom. I learned my street smarts from Detective Bittenbinder. You're not getting me to no secondary location!
just noticed that picture on the wall is danny holding an inhaler and not a glass of milk
This was god damn hilarious
I-.... What!?
Daphne Ur weird
The tape one works really well for zip ties. Use your teeth to tighten them up and then use your ribcage as leverage to break your arms appart.
I really enjoy this more physical content  Edit: It's 2023. Wtf did I mean by this
oh no danny gets kidnapped
The evolution of the Troom Troom narrator is kinda hilarious.
all I’m gonna say is “strike anywhere matches” .. and I’ll leave this right here
I was waiting for this
I've kidnapped someone... :)
0:41 Is that Mickey Mouse
This girl can stop assaults with one easy trick! Kidnappers HATE her!!!! *Girl snaps neck and kills people*
plzzz do another
When he said "Then ill break my wrists and still be trapped" I laughed so hard 🤣🤣🤣
These hacks are bad, but I think the worst part of all are the toe socks that the girl is wearing at 3:09 🤢🤢🤮
Can you post a bloopers for this
thought it was gonna teach you how to kidnap ._.
You should watch the Troom troom zombie apocalypse series (no joke it actually exists)
The Duct tape trick is actually really good to know. It also works on zip ties as well.
You see my thing is, I hate when people say my thing is…
Danny are you going to release the Spooky Boy hoodies again this year? I didn't find out about them until it was too late last year. I've tried looking for someone selling theirs online but can't find any. I don't want to get a knockoff
The lady narrating the first video was forcing her voice to be high pitch and it literally game me a headache
Where was this guy in all of the other videos
I haven’t laughed this hard at a video for so long
The duct (scotch) tape hack actually isn’t too surprising when you think about. Duct tape is designed to be torn along a seam. You can see the fibers that make a grid pattern and also allow you to tear lengthwise or horizontally. Also just throwing your strength and expanding the area that’s tired up is going to break most weak material, I bet you could even break out of the zip ties pretty easily with just brute strength.
If ur kidnapped SNAP THEIR NECK
9:15 Bruno Bucciarati
Waiting for someone to get kidnapped, try a Troom Troom "life hack", it fails, they are rescued and they sue Troom Troom into oblivion
"Now all I need is some rope and chains and a fRienD...to tie me up..." 😂😂😂
8:07 anyone else see the compression glitch?
13:30 My man looks like Griffith from Berserk
th- the w- the wi- win- the wink- I- I-
bruh who the freak was narrating that first Troom Troom video Mickey Mouse?
Loving the Sims 3 music in the background
Dude this was so awesome.
is the music you are using from the Sims or am I just brainwashed?
So much great material for children on YouTube! *child clicks on new Troom Troom video* “if you have a box of matches, you can think of so many fun games!” Also, for the record, my trigger is also on the bottom half of my body. Also either they chained that girl to an empty fuel barrel in which case she could just stand up and walk out with it on her back, or the fuel barrel is full and they placed an ignited lamp directly on top of it, in which case she could catch fire along with the rest of the building and escape her captors by escaping her own body and the physical world.
We as women are told the duct tape and the breathing in, so really hoping they work
Oh so we're not getting free foot content. That's fair. So now I'm just wondering how much it's gonna cost.
“Guys guns don’t kill people…”  Deadass thought he was gonna follow it up with “criminals kill people… with guns”
13:56 for free?   Uhh how much we talking 20, 30 dollars??? HMU if u got the prices
now kurt boy and danny have both been centaurs 2 down one to go
“I feel like I was choking you for a while there…” “yeah you were” 💀
Stockholm set in REAL fast.
Give us more Nick, thank you
"Oh, I'm giving this kidnapping a stellar review on yelp."
My attention was captured successfully so ... Partially true
circumcised glue
Your hair is turning gray danny
Bro she wasnt even wearing socks SHE PAINTED EM BRO YOU CAN SEE HER TOENAILS BROOOO
The hype of seeing Nick in the thumbnail of a 30 min Danny video!? you just know it’s gonna be good.
I'd like to think they went to dennys after this
Stop everything.
YOOO MORE TROOM TROOM HACKS! ITS BEEN FOREVER!! :D
I’m pretty sure the person who wrote these might have *Stockholm Syndrome.*
Kidnappers watching this Interesting *takes notes*    It just popped in my head and I wanted to share Kidnapping is not a joke
when danny said "we're just trying a stupid life hack" and the guy was like "that's the way to be" or whatever, i think he just meant it's good to be stupid/do stupid things? 😆
Ha hoo! ha hoo!
I was most of the way through this video when I noticed I'd been grinning so much it was hurting my face. This won't help me if I'm kidnapped but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Danny should wear a scarf!
this feels like a jojo reference
Definitely my new favorite video of Danny's, how has you're quality and quantity ratio so, so much better
i haven’t laughed this hard at a yt video in a long time
I want to go surfing on Danny’s hair 🏄‍♀️
I like to think that Troom Troom is just trolling us all.
React to Jaystation again. Like if you agree!
"ARE THESE WRITTEN BY KIDNAPPERS? Troom Troom, are you kidnappers?" Sometimes the actors and voice actors in troom troom videos seem like they're being held at gunpoint to make the video.
3:08 why are her socks like gloves
To light a match, you need the sulfur on the match to mix with the red phosphate on the box... so you wouldnt be able to light it on the wall XD
You are going to hate me for this comment when you read it It will be funny    Who's Greg?
DO ZHONG
I thought this was going to be about hacks to kidnap someone, very disappointed
This is boys will be boys
You’ve never looked better! ✌️
I'm honestly glad that duct tape one works bc that's a good thing to know. But Troom Troom giving a working lifehack??? i am in the matrix
I was cleaning my nose piercing and kept getting water all over my table from laughing 💀💀
If only the girls said "Help, let me go" a thousand times. They could have been saved by Varli
The troom troom narrator’s voice is scarier than the entire kidnapping
Why tf is Mickey Mouse narrating this troom troom video
I wish I knew these before I was kidnapped. Would have been helpful.
i was laughing so hard this video was sooo funny
Maybe the kidnapping video was a joke?
I swear this video has me creasing
if every stays napped with no kid in this video its false advertising
Omg this video was so fucking funny!
Is no one going to talk about this chicks socks?
Skyler got super Stockholm syndrome
It's so crazy that you collabed with Nick the same day I started binging his content
the bye is what earned the like
Clicked for Nick. 😍
Is no one gonna talk about that girls socks-
Even if some of the tips in these videos might be helpful, the fact that these videos are targeted towards children, and they paint kidnapping as a _~silly thing that happens LOL🤪~_ is not okay.
Remember when Danny cried because he said beener 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fun fact arrevederci is most famous for being used in jojo
I am pretty sure Houndi Used the breathing strat in his tricks. But I mean the kidnappers will easily notice
Why does the zoomer narrator not pronounce T's? lol.
Kidnappers taking notes
I’m currently being kidnapped and can indeed confirm is completely correct
Instructions unclear, I have my hands tied with scotch tape.
I know troom troom is bad, but theres an even worse channel out their called zoom zoom
Can't wait for troom troom's guide to kidnapping people who have seen their guide to escaping kidnappers.
Keep calm and stay GREG
that nickisnotgreen guy looks exactly like my fav youtubee greenisnotnick
ily dude <3
i stg every video he makes is his best video yet
Is that a Jojo reference
“It’s gloomy in here”  I’m sorry girl what? And what was the dungeon to you, a lively party room? Albeit the bedroom was bland but I mean come on Troom Troom translate😂💀
I have not finished this* Does he know how slowly fabric glue dries? It takes like a half hour to 3 hours, doesn't it?
7:05 why did you use a sound clip from the Eric Andre show lol
the sims 3 music 🥺
But did you know about that Alexa or not tho?
"Arrivederci!" *pause* "Are you getting strangled?"
Troom Troom forget that almost all matches sold these days are *safety* matches 😆
i’m using this diy video to kidnap the narrator
The ski mask joke is stolen from Adult Swim’s Delocated. Sorry to tell you even the one part you enjoyed they didn’t even come up with. 😂
At this point they are just a parody channel now, they are not even trying to be helpful or realistic.
I’m here
God damn Drew, beautiful vid
mama i’m in love with a criminal
I like how Nick was the one to kidnap Danny, since they had their whole 'fight' in Minecraft.
Danny’s best videos ever!!!!!!
13:53 SHOW US YOUR PIGGLY WIGGLIES!!
Danny: is the next life hack gonna be shooting the kidnappers with guns?  Me: *well its not a bad idea*
9:09 Why is there a dismantled female mannequin on the floor???
Troom Troomers seem like the modern equivalent of mimes.
is that a real r2-d2?
Jesus, NicholasLacksVerdancy goes so well with Danny. I need to watch more of his videos.
very useful
"So first you want to sneak up behind your victim and apply chlorof-" _someone whispers to them_ "Oh, sorry. So make sure nobody can sneak up behind you, one way to do this is to surgically add eyeballs to the back of your head."
A half-hour Danny Gonzalez video? What is this? Heaven?!
11:22  Gay people:
You should have nick in the videos more you guy’s energy together is so funny
Aight guys let's go kidnap danny
Troomtroom no longer just dangerous for your mind
toe socks....
5:40 the night vale branch of the nra
I guarantee that these "tricks" are going to get someone seriously hurt if they actually believe in it
Yeah the duct tape hack works but they showed it like crap
The scarf one i'm crying and will die happy
Love this recent content Danny. This and the Tesla video is fantastic content and really fills a big fat void of bad content on youtube. I like this style a lot.
Isn't this just? Just guys being dudes
Is the Sims OST royalty free now?
24:12 you can see just the tiniest bit of gray hair on Danny's temples. hes gonna be a dilapidated old man pretty soon.
does anyone else notice this narrators voice cracking like consistently? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I swear danny gets younger and younger in every video
i really hope nick’s channel gets some more recognition after this collab, he deserves it !!
Your hair looks great
9:08 ok wtf is the mannequin in the back-
The narrators voice gives me a headache
The new narrator’s voice is awful. It’s so clear she’s forcing a specific voice and trying to sound like the old narrator but it’s so grating and sometimes her voice cracks and it’s obvious it’s uncomfortable for her oh my word let her speak normally
danny i miss ur old haircut pls grow back asap thx
Plot twist: the narrator was the kidnapper’s mom
HES BACK
“I feel like I was choking you there for a while”   “Oh yea you were”  Lmao idk about y’all but it had me laughing🤣
There are hacks to escape being kidnapped but where are the hacks for kidnappers so they can be better at their job. Troom Troom is really excluding some potential fans lol. Edit: I wrote this before watching most of the vid but there is a bit where they are kinda on the kidnappers side I think
It would be cool if you make a video reacting to bad songs
2:45 : gen z be like..
It’s obvious that Danny hasn’t watched Schitt’s Creek because Alexis gives David that same duct tape trick, since she’s been kidnapped so many times…
Oh wow, Danny! It's almost like you can rip strips of duct tape, like you do to get it off the roll! But seriously, that duct tape one working was a surprise.  Great video as always!
of all the troom troom videos that seem like thinly veiled f3tish content, this seems particularly egregious
24:25 i ship it
9:46 Hey Danny not a doctor here, I dunno
"I needed to cut the tip off" -Danny 2021
13:26 is killing me 😂
"It's so Boring in the dungeon." Me: Isn't that the POINT of a dungeon???
Arrivederci: : till we meet again : goodbye.
They now need a troom troom video on how to kidnap
I read the title and thought troom troom was giving us advice on how to kidnap people
this is my favorite video on the internet
10:12 chefs kiss
What is with that lady's voice
not us just watching an attempted murder at 24:45
Go Niners
Jake Gyllenhaal would love the 3rd life hack
When you crush someone with a seat, there bones are gettin squishy
You need more rotational force than someone’s body weight in order to snap their neck
I see Troom Troom ripped off Unus Annus for kidnapping hacks
10:10, Dammit Danny, I’m doing my art homework while listening and I messed up a line, I laughed to hard at crush him
Been waiting for one of these, vidz 😅😅♎
I- what- I- I am so- WHAT
Troom troom are you getting strangled in your car do that annoying thing that people do on planes
Why does the narrator sound like a dog toy? Edit: 8:08 datamosh on aisle 4
Did you guys notice that when she lit the match she used her hand in a glove
Danny I love you
danny why are you playing sims 3 create a sim music in the background
I'm the sewist here for Danny having no idea how fabric works lmao
you should make a song about how mush you hate hot glue
i feel like nick grew for this video. like he didnt used to be that big
I’m enjoying The Sims background music
Subscribed, turned on notifications
Plot twist the first one was just troom troom trying to do a kink roleplay scenario
0:41  MICKEY MOUSE IS THAT YOU
Is this . . . A love story?
FYI the ski mask family photo thing is a bit they seemingly took from British Comedian Joe Wilkinson
"couldn't you grab it with your hand?" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
4:00 Danny mai guy, that's Stockholm syndrome at its finest
TroomTroom is trying to normalize kidnapping to bait their viewers into being more susceptible to kidnapping so they can in turn have more victims to ransom out and make bank on.
pausing to sympathise with the poor kidnapped woman as they appear to have glued sequins to her face which... suggests to me she was just kidnapped by the channel...which... would explain the narrator...
Oh I guess this why my little cousin tried to kidnap me! 🤔
OK that duct tape thing was actually really cool
"we weren't expecting visitors" you kidnapped someone how didn't you expect visitors
Holy shit that really is nick in the thumbnail
Nick's quinceañera joke had me rolling lmaoo
That's a very brightly-colored dungeon!
What's wrong with the voice-over girl D:? I hate the way she talks and the intentional voice cracks
why is the narrator Mickey Mouse
Day 3 of asking  Danny to review the Yeager family
Nick and Danny are so fucking funny together😂😂 dying the whole time
Is that the Sims3 CAS music I hear in the background of the intro
Next Troom Troom video: How to steal elections.
NICK OMG!!
15:14 Abraham learning about circumcision through divine intervention
Can this narrator not be so perky? Like- "You just nearly got kidnapped? Oh no!" "Quick, quick, get in he truck!" "It's now or never!"  Bro
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
"How much force I would have to put into throwing it back, to crush someone"
why is no one talking about the sims music in the background
Will we be expecting a Danny Gonzalez x IcyMike collab
This has got to be my favorite video of 2021
4:44 oh that escalated fast
i almost want to put a lot of actual advice on how to escape kidnappings and ab*sive situations that i know actually work lmao
The duct tape one is the only one that works because they took it from a website that has good advice if you get kidnapped
“Gotcha girlie”
Duck tape was on my wrist for 10 minutes
Bro why is the narrator literally Minnie Mouse wtf is this video
I wonder how much does the actors get paid
You are so  cute can stop looking at your fase
Troomy Troomatizing
This is one of Danny's best videos yet.
So subtle, just clean, barely noticed, amazing, the product placement was barely there
15:32 As a professional New Yorker, no, that's not how you wear a scarf. You'd die if you wore it like that. You're welcome.
Not many videos make me literally lol, but this one did, more than a few times.😁
arrivederci means bye in Italian, it's a rather formal bye but yeah
These videos are just obvious viral bait
I think this is the funniest video I've seen in a while. I love nick and I love danny so this is amazing. Yall should collab w drew and kurtis all together 🤣
What happened to the old narrator? No offense but this new one sounds very annoying than the first.
Oh shit new drew video hell yeah
4,603 COMMENT yay...
Stockholm Syndrome.
"i feel like i was chokin u for a while there"  "yeah u were"
When I first saw this I thought it meant tips *to* kidnap people
your and nicks dynamic is probably my favorite ever!! i love this video its so hilarious
happy almost 5 mil subs danny get him to 5 mil by the end of the month
oh troom troom you insane bastards
The kidnappers grunts remind me of a clown core song lol 😆
i laughed almost though the whole thing, thanks Danny for the laugh
Was their trick to catch someone… putting up a box to “scare” them??
I like how the jail is just unlocked and Danny doesn’t even notice 😆
if I have to listen to this narrator’s voice for two more seconds I’m gonna commit suicide
That's illegal, people can't do that
I just want you to know I was crying-laughing throughout the whole video. Thank you so much
The Troom Troom narrator’s voice is slowly driving me insane.
Now you're in the dungeon, how boring. They've chained you to the wall? But these cuffs aren't even fashionable!  Let's find a way to make this more stylish
So sad there’s no spooky song this year
I need more Danny/troomtroom vids in my life
Troom troom are you getting strangled in your car do that annoying thing that people do on planes
The narrators voice must hurt from speaking perpetually in falsetto
GeTcHa GiRlie 💁‍♀️
Nick almost got a kill count during the choking part😂😂😂
I’m waiting on the new spooky boy song
My alexa straight up answered the question
These will be helpful in case Joel Haver ever attempts to kill you
Breaking someone's neck would tear there nerves apart cause the nerves are on the spine and nerves are the things that connect to the brain that helps us do really anything
I just tried with scotch tape and I couldn't do it
Stockholm syndrome set in pretty quickly there!
good video... but WHY IS THERE SIMS 4 MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND
Troom Troom is giving us advanced lessons in Stockholm syndrome.
this kinda reminds me of when danny gonzalez tried troom troom’s awful kidnapping hacks tbh
why is the narrator mickey mouse
As a woman, I am already so prepared for these situations, so hit me with your best shot, Troom Troom.
8:05 door go brrrrrrr
the sims 3 background music was comforting
Someone give the narrator some water.
you can rip ducktape with your hands very easily, actually. i learned that a few years ago and have used it many times it cant be ripped lengthwise easily but along its width it totally can with the right sort of know how troom troom actually wasn't wrong with that one, which is an absolute shock
Danny and nick is such a killer combo
13:23   That’s what she said.  Or he. I love gay guys.
OMG I JUST SPIT MY WATER ALL OVER MY COMPUTER BECAUSE OF 25:00 WHEN HE CRUSHED NICK ☠️
this video is giving me deja vu and i have no clue why
The thing the annoys me more than these  “ life hacks” is the narrator.
i don’t know if i’m just really tired- although it’s only 8:00- but this was probably the most i’ve ever laughed at a video in a really long time
Ah yes, Chekov's duvet
This is the best video you've done in a while ..
Why did Danny do this under a ladder?! Did he not learn from the umbrella curse last craft time? 😁
I'm sorry- but her voice is so annoying xD it kind of reminds me of missy from BigMouth (the first vid)
All I can think watching this is STREET SMARTS. (Specifcally the car one reminds me of the "punch out the tail light)
What if the handcuffs are metal instead of rope or plastic?
22:40 I've never been so intimidated by Danny 🤣
The high pitched girly voice is hurting my ears.
hearing the camera guy laughing during the chair part while nick just stares at you is the funniest thing in the world HELPPP
hi danny
This way too funny,  you guys have to do more videos together
Bruh u make laugh ever day thank u so much for being a person that makes people laugh 😁😁😂
Why am I overanalyzing TroomTroom?
Omg great video !!!!!
Danny escaped so easily because he has SqUiShY bOnEs XD
You know, I didn't think Troom Troom's voice-over could be worse, but I was obviously wrong. I honestly think that SimplyNailogical's parody voice is less terrible and more understandable than this new voice. I mean, shit, the old voice wasn't great, but at least it was perfectly intelligible.
Are we not talking about Danny's use of The Sims music in this video?
*hides strike anywhere matches in my pocket.* Just in case
Why did they tie the victim's hands in front? Do they not know that it is easier to untie yourself when your hands are in front. From this observation I can assume that the kidnappers are inexperienced and probably have never kidnapped before. So it might be easier to escape.
The way danny used sims 3 music in the background
" god he looks good" "I love it when he wears that scarf " Me awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
a a
Nick casually trying to kill danny
These hacks are as effective as real self defense videos for women. LoL.
How did the scotch tape hack actually work wat?!?
the first girls socks tho
Danny: what does arrivederci mean? Jojo fans: ...
i can hardly stomach the troom troom narrators voice
I think this is officially my favorite collab video phahahaha
This is literally the funniest video I have ever seen
OMG! YOU’RE BACK TO TROOM TROOM LIFE HACKS!
How does Danny still have friends
All i could pay attention to in the intro is the sims 3 music in the background.
It's great to see Nick helping out smaller channels.
guess why they're called life hacks
The narration is just one long voice crack
When my teacher says my name I no longer respond.. Since I now only respond to GREG!!
can we please talk about danny turning a beanie into a mask and then back again into a beanie
arrivederci In dutch means until we meet again
i’m sorry but the tufts of hair sticking out of the mask look like eyebrows-
7:16  PLS HIS FACE- I CANT BREATHE-
Are toe socks still relevant?  I guess with Troom Troom getting kidnapped and brought to a dungeon with a clean toilet anything is possible!  Thanks Danny for showing me how to escape kidnappers!!  GREG 4 LIFE
they both run like sims
The duct tape trick is a real hack! They totally stole that one from someone else, I've def heard it before lol. Good ol troom troom.
I didn't know that toesocks exist. Kinda weird though...
the title of this video made me think danny was going to kidnap people
Bro the coughing when he tried to make the mask had me dying-
I love how nick was like “I felt like I was choking you” and Danny with a very serious was was just like “you were “ while the camera turned away lmao
Laughed so hard I choked on my rice crispies
1:42 More like Troom-troom-atizing
11:11
I cant with this sims 3 musikk
If you are wondering what the background music at 29:26 is, it's by SINY - Shokawa.
First thing I thought off the title was that Troom Troom was giving advice on HOW to kidnap
TESLA HE HAS A TESLA
I feel like this is Troom troom’s attempt to give bad life hacks so they can kidnap kids at they just do this-
Ok there’s actually a way to break duck tape on your wrist but it hurts like hell and your wrists swell up a ton yes I’m speaking from personal experience yes I’m an idiot that duct taped my own wrist to try it
This had me rolling🤣🤣
" Are you getting *strangled?* " That's normal.
*quietly hums “Help, lemme go, help, lemme go…”*
Getting kidnapped by Nora from ICarly is worse than these
seeing nick next to danny being like his height is making me trip out
The fact that you can see the camera shaking from the cameraman laughing during the Alexa thing 💀💀💀💀
They left a girl with rope in our bedroom I don't think they just want Ransom
Danny: they're back Me: They Never Left. THEY NEVER LEFT DANNY! THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE
This is genuinely one of the funniest videos I’ve seen in a while
I love kidnapping
Is anyone gonna talk about whats on the floor at 9:09
I feel like danny and nick not knowing you can legitimately break duct tape and zip ties with the last one has to be male privilege or something 😭 like I'm pretty sure every girl has been taught this shit right??
Guns don't kill people.. uh uh.. i kill people (chk chk).. with guns (pow)
لا
It's it just me or is Danny looking more and more like Ellen?
nick is such a good boy
You have to give Nick a ps5 now
Cannot believe Danny got kidnapped and at no point did he say "stop kidnapping me" :/
ok but wheres nick's tv and playstation??
ilysm
Maybe it will work better in reality, get in the van
“EMILY KNOWS A GREAT TRICK SHE CAN USE TO ESCAPE! MURDER! STRAIGHT UP SNAPPING SOMEONE’S NECK!”
6:49 lmao MK11. of course they are a raiden main
petition for more nick in videos
why is no one talking about: "are you tied up with scotch tape? PERFECT"
3:18 I have never been more repulsed by anything in the entire world. What in the world are her socks.
yo? sims 3 background music?
I burst into absolute hysterics when the girl just snaps her attackers head from behind her holy shit
you had to cut the tip off
troom troom on some next level big brain power
nick: "i feel like i was choking you for a while there' danny: "yeah you were"
“…what every good kidnapping lair has!” “…Guns?” “CRIMINALS! This is a CRIMINAL!” “Oh”
I thought the last narrator’s voice was insufferable
I've been laughing so hard at this video
30 seconds in and very disappointed that these are not life hacks about how to kidnap someone.
I liked that bit with the passerby.
Danny: Since when are criminals good at arts and crafts? Me: Well since troom troom are kidnappers confirmed, I guess for a while
When I read the title, I thought this was going in a whole different direction
Was that sims music
Now I know how to make sure they stop escaping
"Im a kidnapper not a robber"  *professionals have standards*
For the ski mask task failed successfully
Once in high school, I did an entire presentation with testing on how to escape kidnapping and other paranoid situations. What he did with the duck tape is a legit tactic to break out of zip ties - it fucking hurts but it can work. High schoolers were hurt in the making of this, but no point deducted 😎
I thought it was about HOW to kidnap someone 👁👄👁
Na na na sister! I'd rather take advice from JJ Bittenbinder and buy a money clip.
I like how one of the tips is just *SNAP YOUR ATTACKERS NECK*
I’m going to ignore the naked dummy in the corner 9:09
This is the hardest I've laughed in a LONG time thanks Danny
if anyone i know got a ransom note from my kidnappers that said “we want TV >:(“ they would probably laugh and throw it away
I love the idea of lighting a match and melting through a zip tie with your TOES when the “scotch tape” thing works for zip ties too lmao
kinda rude that Danny didn't get nick a tv for kidnapping him. Its like he didn't even appreciate getting kidnapped :/
I wish i had a thrash content multimillion subscriber channel like troom troom
Dan Dan the kidnapped man ✨
wait he finally let the nick clone out of the tube
Ok but with the second video couldn't she just pull the thing inside the trunk that opens it? Or am I dum
The handcuff thing works really well if your arms are zip tied together. I’ve never seen anyone use tape before.
The duct tape trick is actually a legit technique, they just didn’t show it well in the video lol. I’ve done it through I think up to 5 or 6 layers of tape before, it’s pretty fun
10:55 or they can strangle you with their arms
8:40 Harry Houdini
I think TroomTroom is literally trolling at this point for views because it seems like it's working 😭
Breaking down the stupidity  Of TroomTroom videos  should be a channel in and of itself.  There's SO MUCH to unpack😑
Aww Nick didn't know what to do with his hands poor guy
stock music bad
wow the new mythbusters rocks
I want someone to look at me the way Danny looks at nick in  19:07
I am guessing the original narrator was murdered likely in TroomTroom's own Battle Royale (2000)
“Wear toe socks at all times” Me with webbed toes: welp I’m screwed
I knew of the tape one but the others LMFAO
DANNY WHERES OUR HALLOWEEN SONG THIS YEAR
3:09 WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE SOCKS
narrator sounded like mickey or minnie Mouse
3:07 HER SOCKS 😨 edit: he noticed the socks LMFAO
27:48 Danny is legally skilled
Just thinking about the truck guy who’d rather be doing life hacks…
Now no one can kidnap Danny because they know that he’ll escape
Loved this video omg
The moral of the story is if someone kidnaps you, just give them what they want!                 Wait…
I haven't watched yet but I saw the title went "that sounds really dumb. Perfect" and clicked
If these people had a TacBat they wouldn't have been kidnapped in the first place.
nick is so good in this video lmao
It looks like Nick cut holes in the top of his beanie so we can still see his hair.
"I'm not gonna show my feet for you weirdos."   I took that personally. GIVE US YOUR FEET DANNY.
6:48  Wait so they have a PS5  BUT NO TV!?!!
Troom troom kinda reminds me of the Spiderman Elsa, food rubbed on the counter, like eerily cheerful fetish/horror videos
danny with the machs he sounded like a12 year old boy
Wait but when I was 9/10 I would use a hot glue gun and burn myself a lot but…it didn’t hurt ….sooooo I’m just better
if anyone wants actual advice for if someone grabs you from behind and tries to drag you off, bend in half. it shifts your center of gravity and makes it super hard for them to carry you away. there’s a whole “bear hug street technique” i learned in karate as a kid, i’m guessing it’s probably something you could find on youtube
Honestly I've done the exact same thing with fabric glue.
As an ex horse girl I knew the puffing yourself out while being tied up one because horses will actually do that so their saddle will slip off
the duct tape thing is magic you wizard Dan
The duck tape one can be used on zipties
Good job Martin that’s a Felony   Best sentence of 2021
Nobody: Bruno Bucciarati: 9:10
Is it me or is Life hacks getting worse just makes me want to shoot out my brain god kill me
fire video
Jesus Christ the narrator sounds like Micky Mouse on crack
If your relying on Troom Troom hacks for Kidnapping hacks, its just natural selection lmao
the sims 3 build music was so fucking distracting
I’m very upset that I actually learned something from Troom Troom.
Yah excuse me, I have ski mask genetics.
The tape thing can work but it was definitely precut in the troom troom video
"Arrivederci" -Goodbye It was a JoJo reference the whole time
The kidnappers have visible tattoos showing. They are such professionals.
Alright who's the new narrator for these god awful troom troom videos, I want the old one back
Omg pls do more videos like this I loved it, also love Nickkkk
10:03 is she a fuckin vampire or something what the hell js that
best part of the day
The kidnapping hacks were bad before too LOL next video with Troom Troom, I just wanna see your reaction to their FIRST VIDEO!
I was having a good time watching Danny, now that Nick showed up as a kidnapper, I am having a GREAT time
I couldn’t stop laughing through this entire video 😂😂
The first one is just straight Stockholm Syndrome
31 minute Danny Gonzalez video, FUUUUUUUUCK YEEEEESSSS.
is no one going to mention how the girl with the toe socks just straight up switches to having a hand in her foot? some of those shots holding the match are definitely a fucking hand
Apparently dungeons are supposed to be entertaining with lots of activities😑 TroomTroom really out did  themselves with this one. Whoever writes their scripts  is out of touch with real life.
dude got a shimipan on his neck
JOJO REFERENCE IN TROOM TROOM
Danny your just genuinely hilarious and yourself. Thank you for that
“i’m not gonna try that on an actual person.” danny’s dog:
the narrator sounds like someone from Making Fiends
I'm glad you tried the duct tape one, cause I was about 70% sure it would work, but I also didn't want to break my wrists trying it
I recognise sims 3 music when I hear it, Daniel!
I’m teaching all of these techniques to my children, especially how to snap someone’s neck if they’re holding you from behind.
i love the banter between danny and nick,,, you should collab w/ nick more, he's awesome & i'm not being paid to say this <3
9:23 are we not gonna talk about the naked mannequin in the corner
at least you didn't post this video in August!
this the 2nd time u and cody uploaded in the same day ever since you guys collabed  u trying to tell us something?
thought after seeing thumbnail:   danisnotonfire —> danisnowonfire
I want danny to change his first name to speedy soooo.........     Speedy Gonzales
13:48 I can't believe he foiled our plans just like that.
O I thought they were teaching hacks on how to kidnap lol
24:00 There was yet again some weird tension between the two
I thought they were hacks on how to kidnap someone
Why on earth was “do you know how to do a square knot” “what’s a square knot?” “the kind of knot you’d tie, you fuckin square” so funny 😂😅
Drew could have really used this kidnapping escape info when he was being kidnapped, punched once, and taken to Coastal Rica.
today on hackbusters...
HELL YEAH NICK!!!
The duct tape thing actually does work lmao they teach it in self defense classes
That voice... I... Feel such hatred
I enjoy that in the family photo, they not only had the babies wearing ski masks, but they had shrunk down photos of the adult kidnapper's faces and pasted them on the fake babies heads.
Arebbe derche loserz
POV: you're watching this in 2019
danny saying “hey, alexa” and actually getting a response
NICK hi
I thought her foot was switched with a sock covered hand bc her toes looked so long
Your collabs with Nick are hilarious, please do more!
DannYS FACE WHEN HE WAS HOLDING HIS BREATH OMG
A troom troom life hack actually worked. That’s somehow the weirdest part
Where is the end screen song?  I'm sad.
Cant wait to do nothing
first they encourage people to prank their friends, then they encourage people to spy on their friends, and now they are encouraging people to kidnap their friends. I don't want to see where this is going.
This could very well be the funniest video I’ve seen all year
I love the Sims music in the background ❤️
Is Sims 3 music playing in the background?
"If you're tied up, just stand up and leave."  :D
lol
Oh thank god, I'm being kidnapped right now and just watched a couple of videos of how to not be kidnapped and I needed someone to make sure they actually worked.
Did you make sure to get "strike anywhere" matches?
Ok but like Danny was seriously serving looks when he was walking towards the car with that scarf. He should wear one more often!
Oh god troom troom is back
wow I hate when the dungeon is boring :(
I'm very happy danny followed through with his promise
*FBI:* “We’ll find this group at any cost.”
This face says it all 😂 7:19
the duck tape thing is actually a hack for zip ties and you have to hit your wrists on your knees or legs or whatever
mickey mouse voice " gotcha girlie"
i love how most of the troom troom life hacks were shit until the end when they gave benefitial advice actual self defense teachers would give you
Gimme your get in the car. Ah yes, the famous kidnapper phrase
I’m uncomfortable. And scared. Is troom troom going to kidnap me?
The narrator sounds like she really wants to drop the high pitched annoying ass voice and you can kind of tell when it shakes.
dandy gondola
But imagine if someone saw them filming this in public...
Danny trying the match hack: Can light a match against the match box but can't against the wall which was all that was available in the back.  Can melt zip ties if someone else is holding the flame but not alone like the video said.  Also Danny: I think that pretty much confirms this could work.
Im surprised more people didn't know about the breathing in and duct tape tips. They're legitimately true and can often help, their impact is just greatly exaggerated by troom troom.
what.
Is the ski mask attached to their skin? Are they guns? What is this video?
Lol danny your such-and-such are so good or not yet you can expect to be able to move in with your current employer, so proud.
Hi
okay but he did look good in the scarf, UNTIL i saw those asics ass tennis shoes bruh
My friends and i did an escape room where we had to escape from a kidnappers house and we kept saying how nice they were for giving us clues to escape and a cot
11:10 "Are you tied up with scotch tape, Perfect"
This seems fun maybe I should get kidnapped
These channels r like bad kind of meme, they r self aware that what they doing r cringy but also there is a sense of seriousness and casualty bad meme potential at the same time. Its a weird breed of content. They expect YouTube commentators will make content on them also people who watch them also like to feel smart as they feel this is so stupid lets cringe with our friends,troom troom kind of content creators thrive on the criticism of their content not the value of the inherent content of theirs like any other content creators does.
The narrator's voice is 1000x more annoying I want to punch the wall everytime I hear it.
Loving the sims background music
Nick is not green 🥰🥰🥰
The narrator’s voice is somehow 1000x worse than the last one’s. Impressive.
yes i love when danny crafts
13:37 Why is my mind like this….
That duct tape lifehack isn't something Troom Troom came up with. That's an already existing method to break out of zip tie handcuffs.
sims music god tier
god, this is so dumb 😭😭😭
Maybe the family photo is meant to highlight the fact that few people choose a life of crime, rather our social environments in which we grow up have a huge part in the direction our lives take... there's a chance i'm reading too much into a Troom Troom video.
They actually wanted a tv because without there bones are getting squishy
Was absolutely not expecting to hear Arrivederci in this video
I was dead when he inhailed the fuz balls-
I have a strong feeling that the children who watched the original video were thinking that it could save their life.
NICK & DANNY NICK & DANNY
14:35
with the “scotch tape hack”, all i could think of was when unus annus did it lmao
I immediately recognized the sims 3 music in the background
imagine kidnapping someone and having them follow lifehacks that you made up to try and escape
I feel like the people in the second video took a self defense class and were half asleep through it and only got the jist of what they're supposed to do
Posted at 6:09😎
the narrator is so infuriating to listen to lmao
this is danny's kinkiest vid yet
Eventually troom troom is just gonna figure out how to hack their way out of death and give god a massive middle finger on the way
I gave my kidnappers a diploma and a Nobel peace prize for kidnapping me. They deserve it after putting in so much effort to get me out of all the individuals out there :")
Thanks for the help! Now I’m gonna make sure they never have the materials to do them!
is the narrator mickey mouse wtf is that voice
i can’t like this video.   there was a lowes commercial before it.
why did i think this was a video about learning how to kidnap people?
Perhaps he can now kidnap Drew so he can be the only white boy on the internet with brown hair blue eyes and a beautiful wife.
Fly Chicago shirt, dude
Okay but I tried this with scotch packing tape and it didn’t work 😂😅
6:11 That really was a nice joke Danny
I’m I the only one a bit bothered by this Troom troom video, which is obviously targeted towards children practically encouraging playing with matches. They literally use that phrase.  There is a reason that they made kids PSAs and that it has to be actively discouraged it kid’s media- that shit is dangerous.  Some of Troom troom’s stuff looks pretty dangerous but at the very least it’s fantastically and might require weird supplies, matches are much more accessible if a parent isn’t super careful.  I just feel that it goes to show how absolutely little thought goes into troom troom and similar channels. All they care about is view and they couldn’t care less about quality or even seemingly the safety of the kids watching.
does anyone else find the narrators voice so f*ing annoying...... Or is it just me like.
The duct tape trick is actually a real thing but I was a bit unsure about the one Troom Troom showed  because the way I was taught it was to go for the hips instead of straight down but I guess it works both ways
y did Danny say f and didn't actually curse. Im CONCERNED
I cannot believe that last one actually worked.
The DCU(Danny cinematic universe) is getting stronger by the dau
✨☺️🦧🍄Did you get kidnapped by the last craft you made from us?! Well here’s how you escape th ei r  W r a t h ✨🦔😩☺️
Troom troom just showed off Stockholm Syndrome in a life hack video.  -Sheep with internet
I gotta say, escaping your kidnappers and then giving them the ransom they wanted is a power move.
Most important Troom Troom kidnapping life hacks: Wear a scarf and toe socks if you're gonna be kidnapped ✔  Stockholm Syndrome means just buying you're kidnappers a flat-screen TV ✔
NOT MY ALEXA TELLING ME TOO
My uncle has a criminal in his closet, idk which one it is but I saw it.
Thanks for the tips on how to kidnap you Danny, now I know not to use duct tape lmao
22:21 looks like a powerful confrontation scene in an action movie… you know… excluding Nick’s hair poking out of the holes of the beanie.
The surprise alexa… she’s everywhere!!
Me watching ads to pledge my alliance to Greg.
shouldnt you actually exhale as much as possible so that theres slack in the rope? if u inhale youll be tied tighter than ur supposed to be?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Completely duct tape
It’s crazy to think that ADULTS make those Troom Troom videos…. ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
"are you being strangled?"   " :/.. yeah.." help me
24:29  So careless and ethereal... 25:35 Look at them go 🥲
All right time to make an only fans for the feet if you’re really going to say that we could pay to see them
I totally misunderstood the family photo and thought one of the guys was wearing a dress and they were both holding random babies!
i was thinking of making slightly darker themed troom troom parodies for fun but it seems they’ve beaten me to it
You can do the ductape thing with zip ties too
oh shit the match made a match sound??
Hehehehe ima rat
30:22 ned flames would love that one
Troom trooms new VA sounds like she’s from My Little Pony
I didn’t know Danny made couple vlogs
Guys...please don’t tell Danny, but the guilt is just too much. I searched what the fastest growing army on the internet is. I am now in prison.
Nick: "I feel like I was choking you for a while there" Danny: "Yeah, you were" fave part
C'mon now danny I love ya but the duct tape thing was obvious and common knowledge
King is back bb
and that just goes to show, you litterally cannot kidnap danny because he's got them troom troom life hacks up his sleeves
So many out of context clips could be made from this one video
The “gAtchA GirLy!” had me cackling for about 10 minutes
So, I’ve actually tried the duct tape hack, (cause I’m weird like that) and you actually need to  move your wrists away from each other sharply as you bring your arms down. It might take a few tries but it should work eventually
14:07 Japan creating tabi socks circa 15th century AD
I still can't believe the duct tape hack worked
im very curious who is recording yall lol
this was SO cute please do more with nick in person
not the sims 3 music
im sorry danny this is platonic bdsm
yes crafts !!!!
Troom troom criminal baby lore
NIIIIICCCK
Nickisnotgreen, more like nickisnotgoodatkidnapping
the “tense up while being tied up” is actually a real thing, in case anyone was wondering. it doesn’t work quite as well as in the troom troom video but it gives you a little more space to work with.  edit: since people actually saw this i want to mention the duct tape thing is real, too. obviously it won’t work that easy though. you’re supposed to raise your arms over your head and bring them  down sharply and quickly, while also pulling your elbows apart. it’ll probably take a couple tries but it is genuinely good advice.
no bc that mask making part literally made me CRY LAUGH
I did it perfectly wrong it seems” sent me😂
Troom troom's female narrator sounds like she's tryna sound like a girl
Video make me smile multiple times
i have just literally had the worst weekend of my life and im dreading tomorrow but i saw you posted and i feel slightly better so honestly thank you so much
danny where did you get that murder basement
Danny, can you make a collab with Drew?? Pleaseee 👉💖👈
it's like the narrator swallowed up a whole bunch of helium and tried to make it sound as "normal" as possible
15:07 doctors when boys are 1 second old
what is a troom
She kinda sounds like eugenia cooney
dude be acting like the guy from Shaun the sheep 4:47
Are we not going to talk about that naked mannequin the background  9:07
If I had a penny for every time I got kidnapped I’d have exactly GREG pennies
Duct tape has a like a grid of string so it’s easy to get different sizes that have a straight edge. It might be harder with like packing tape tho
4:49 why did I have to rewatch multiple times
Danny is wearing the same sweatshirt he wore on his "Why does anyone believe everything on TikTok" video.
danny you peel the velcro
The fact that you put The Sims 3 game soundtrack in the begining amazes me.
That crack sounded real
The amount of joy Danny gets while breaking the duct tape is SO GOOD
How is it a life hack if you’re dead?
sometimes i remember that there are actual human beings that are making and shooting these skits
I’ve missed some good old fashioned Troom Troom content. Glad to be a Greg 👏
Everyone needs to like and share and tweet and Facebook this so danny can make back the money fm the garage rental
The dislikes are from kidnapper’s
15:07 Doctors when baby boys get born.
The expression of the troom troom girl when she leans the car chair back is making me lose my fucking mind. Complete blank staring into space
Yes it does kill people snaping makes  can kill people😐😑😐
3:08 she... she has finger socks... 😳
i meaaannnn tbf, i think it's okay to snap someone's neck if they have already kidnapped you LOL
That fuckin' yea u were, had me chocking like danny on the fluff
I actually think duct tape is way easier to break than scotch tape (I can tear off a peice of duct tape with my hands but I need those spiky teeth to cut scotch tape) so I was actually looking forward to you using the scotch tape you brought.
Damm dude really love ur hair today
the ski mask is actually their face skin
Thank you for hiring the garage and the nick
greg
many innuendos
hilarious video, u and nick are a funny collab
Danny blink twice if troom troom is holding you captive
So is a gun a criminal now?
I’m going tbh and say when I clicked on this I fully expected that troom troom had released a video on how to kidnap someone and I didn’t even question it.   Ps. I hope you bought Nick a tv for being a good kidnapper!
the family portrait is so unironically funny lmao
Ur Hair is Amazing!!!
3:09 hold the phone, toe socks? Absolutely disgusting
What is the sims music doing in the background?! Haha I love it
Nick is adorable what can I say
Troom troom is legit better content than Danny Gonzalez lol..
I do not understand how but that scarf takes *years* off Danny. Seriously, at 15:32 he looks about 10.
Stockholm syndrom at it finest
9:00 that's actually smart. If you tense all your muscles and make your body bigger they tie you up to that size. Then you can suck in your fat and stop tensing all your muscles you can wiggle your way out because your smaller then the chain's limit.
i love that like he majority of this community is so cool. like everyone is funny and like chill at the same time. idk everyone here is just awesome
The "bye!" in the final second of the video was by far my favorite part.
Why. The Sims music
Let’s gooo! DG uploaded again!
Hey let’s not shame Troom Troom, one of their writers clearly has some type of abduction fantasy kink...yeah on second thought never mind shame away...
reminds me of a great song i once heard...... "guns don't kill people - ah uh. i kill people, with guns. pow!"
This made my day
…
I like the idea that the kidnapper saw the “scotch tape” escape trick and was like “I wanna try!”
why is the narrator's voice like that ... also troom troom scares me to the depths of my soul
Oh my goodness I always get strangled how useful
“i feel like i was choking you for a while” “yea you WERE”  PLEASE😭
What SWAT gunner is working for troom troom???
The narrator's voice counts as a sonic weapon
what do you mean they mostly worked, that shouldn’t be right, do it again but fail laughably
Thanks Danny now I can defend myself
Thanks for these tips now I know what opportunities kids can use to escape from.
tbh this is the best video danny has ever made
sims 3 music
The Sims 3 music thoooo
I'm definitely Greg now... Right?! 🖤🖤🖤
I haven’t laughed this hard in forever; Danny, I’m sorry you suffered making that mask but you DID slay me
Lol Alexis in Schitt's Creek has the exact same breaking out of tape hack
I literally just found nicks channel IN THIS HOUR, watched one of nicks videos, and then this one shows up   I’m scared
The new troom troom voice us the voice I imagine Tavros Nitram has, hE TYPES LIKE, uH, tHIS
4:36 9:09 10:40 24:24
ok but the narrators voice sounds like mickey mouse, it just needs the signature laugh
13:07 Danny looks like how a little kid coughs
29:12 Nick’ hair coming out of the eye holes like he has pigtails 😊
Love it
31:15  danny are you ok are you ok danny
The fact how I was watching his troom troom videos a couple of days ago..
hey   greg
this video made me laugh so hard i dribbled one the floor
I’m just happy the tiny facial hair is gone it was giving me anxiety last time
I thought for a second in parents photo the parents was the brothers...*sweet home Alabama starts playing*
i just about died at the criminals part
Do you think kidnappers watch video son how to escape kidnappers to find new ways to kidnap people
Heck yeee
mate with me father
I love how Danny says “Alexa what does (however you spell it) mean” and an actual Alexa that they didn’t know were there responsed
Is that princess peach narrating these videos
Also doesn’t “Arrivederci” mean “goodbye until we meet again”???   Why was that woman planning on meeting her kidnappers again?
GaChYa GiRlY
3:08 I’ve kidnapped someone before. This happens all the time
Does Danny have Billie Eilish eyes, or does Billie have Danny Gonzalez eyes? 🤔
you shouldve just said help, let me go, help, let me go, help, let me go, stop kidnapping me
2 things  1. Danny, you butchered Arivaderrchi  2. You into some kinky shit
man i wish it was me tying you up 😩😩😩
Idk if its just me but is danny looking older and older, and i cant tell if thats a gray hair on the front
The ductape trick actually working was the biggest plot twist ever.
bye
DANNEEEE
i love that nick is a common collab now. the vibes he brings are so funny and wholesome!!!! <3
That wriggling out of the ropes hack would never work for any of us with boobs.......
YES NEW VIDEO
Danny in the ski mask looks like Femto from Berserk...just saying
Some kid who watches these 'life hacks' is seriously going to think that any of this will work. Surprised that the duct tape thing was actually helpful
Holy shit that narrators voice sounds like Mickey Mouse strung out on crack for 5 days with no sleep sheesh so fuckin annoying
Kinda early check check
danny who did you kidnap?
DUDE DANNY! The guns are gonna prepare even more for the next time your kidnapped!
Ugh, I hate it when my kidnapper’s dungeon is too boring 🙄🙄😡🤪
I know somethings wrong with me when I’m upset that they changed the narrators voice
I vote for more videos with Nick!
Myghaaawd did I just hear a sims 3 soundtrack? Hahaha
is his hair grey
The Sims 3 music in the background is killing me
Is that the sims theme? - Lord Salvator
why is eugenia cooney narrating
i thought that duct tape trick was known, i've known about it for years lol
good one danny
As a Greg who rewatches Danny's videos often,this is one of the funniest
YOU THOUGHT WE WOULDNT NOTICE THE SIMS 3 MUSIC?!?!
Danny’s feet are built like that of a teenage mutant ninja turtle
Troon Troon: oh no, are the taliban burning your house??  Use this life hack! An ef-98 rocket launcher!
if you get kidnaped and your watching a troom troom video to try too escape maybe your there for a reason
Reality: tries to break scarf but fails Slowly goes back and he grabs your head
15:14 that’s what she said
omg this room is filled with criminals!!1!!!1111!!1!1!😟😟😟😔😔😔😡😡😩😩😎😎😟😟💯💯💯😭😭😪😪😭😪😞😞😞😣😣😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😲😲😲😲😮😮😮😮
I’ve seen that tape one on a self defense video before
How is the camera person not cry laughing this whole time? 😂
Imagine getting a message from your friend saying “Hey can you kidnap me?” Lmao
Remind me to not kidnap Danny!! Seriously. That would be illegal and weird
Was the fourth view but I got caught up in star wars story clips for like an hour
i wish his friend went along with it instead of sounding annoyed lol
Dude You don't need matches to escape a ziplock binding All you need are your shoe laces
Mickey mouse's new occupation is a little strange I can't lie
You have nice skin... For a YouTuber.
this was so funnyyyyyyyy
Can’t wait to take Troom Troom’s renowned self-defense classes.
In the most respectful way possible, I must admit that I watched Danny wink a couple times. Like respectfully
Y’all are hilarious together 😂🤣
they can get a ps5 but not a tv
this was the third funniest video I've ever watched. Both the first two are also Danny
why is the voiceover so annoying lol
They are both tied up and danny is choked. what in the kink
Dan Dan, the Troom Troom exposing man😂
Irl mobile game ads
The way this video’s titled, I thought it was going to be a video on HOW to kidnap someone… idk if I’m relieved or disappointed
Why in the second lifehac was therer a naked manaken woman
9:09 why do they have mannequin like that? …😟
Yo I got a pit mix named Wednesday
190k views 1 hour
The wrist thing is actually what I'm being taught in self defense class is the most effective way to separate your wrists
I couldn't watch the last life hack without hearing alexis rose's voice in my head
That looks like it was a lot of fun but also scary. Not just the choking, but having fire that near your skin
Bromance
5:37 obvious reference to guns don’t kill people by Jon lajoie
This video could be of great help to Sia😥 sending it rn
something about danny in that frog shirt, standing next to nick makes him look like that one annoying little cousin who thinks hes really cool cuz he calls you swear words.
Minnie Mouse really left Disney just to become Troom Troom’s narrator huh
Is a by product of being a woman that I was taught all of these at 13 because I’m baffled that Danny hasn’t seen these
These kidnapping tips have the same energy as detective JJ Bittenbinder
I'm honestly surprised there aren't more comments from people enjoying Danny getting tied up.  You know what I mean.
if anyone kidnaps me i am just going to slap them with legal
Well..actually the running iff you can is key and most law enforcement will tell you to do so. Even if there's a gun. Bc once they get you away then youre donezo
danny are you gonna start streaming again
The thumbnail is glorious
I read the title and thought what hacks do they have for kidnapping people
LMFAO IM SO SCARED HES GONNA BURN HIS TOES
That was a fun video :)
Danny looks simultaneously 12 and 33 and I can't see anything else now
With Nick's level of commitment to the strangling hack, this almost became a snuff film.
FINALLY
Danny did you use the sims build/buy music lol
Me getting strangled and looking on YouTube how to stop it
Actually I read the second hack in this book I read in middle school, so no, Troom Troom did not come up with it; it was common knowledge beforehand
lmao the description of the video
"Straighten yourself"  Me being gay:
Awesome videos sorry I’m sooo late
wait, danny is like 10 years older than nick!?!
Thanks Danny, I'll remember these hacks when I'm out kidnapping
Is it jus me or does Danny look kinda weird in this one.
Bro I was so confused because I got an ad at like 15:30 and it was about Velcro’s and then Danny comes back on talking about velcroing the scarf. I was like wait was that an ad or a bit or what.
Now I crush his bones - every fat girl giving a lap dance
Nobody:  Troom Troom at the beginning: aRe YoU bEiNg StRaNgLeD???
How else can I know how to kidnap properly 😑. Also does it count as kidnap if u have stolen many beings?
NAH I THOUGHT THE TITLE MEANT KIDNAPPING (SOMEONE) HACKS, NOT ESCAPING KIDNAPPERS
my brain can’t process this video
Who disliked the video
WE’RE ALMOST AT 5 MIL GREG!
YOOOOO NICK
when the kidnappers in the video pushed her to the bed i was legit SO TERRIFIED of what would come next
Please try self defense techniques from the Gracie breakdown YouTube channel
I'm going to hear that narrator in my nightmares.
31:16 min Danny 😍
the narrator sounds like she fucked up her voice real bad
9:10 they literally pronounced arrivederci so poorly. When Danny said “Arrivadoochie losers!” I died of laughter 😭
*oh my god what*
are they sponsored by playstation???
bruh the duct tape is literally made to be ripped apart with your fingers in one go lol
Loving the frog shirt B)
It’s actually pretty cool that the duct tape one worked. Now try 5 layers
lol there is a difference between strike anywhere matches and average matches... not sure what the odds are your kidnappers keep strike anywhere matches on hand to play with.
That duct tape hack also works for zip ties. I wouldn't recommend trying it unless you need it because zip ties have a good chance of breaking your wrist or at least hurting a lot, but if it means getting free from a kidnapping, I'd rather have the broken wrist. Just make sure the zip tie is as tight as it can be on you
You could just chew your way through those zip tie restraints. Just saying.
In case you're wondering what to actually do if someone tried to kidnap you, you're suppose to thrash, bash, break bones, jump out of a moving car. Basically do whatever you can to get away because more than likely they will kill you once they get you to their base. Don't assume they'll keep you alive if you comply.
*snaps neck" Then there sirens out side
THE END
missed you danny
yo ULTIMATE life hack: if the kidnappers have fkin ALEXA just be like hey alexa call the cops
Drew looks a bit different today
12:17 I feel really uneasy about this dutch angle, I feel like some climactic showdown is about to happen.   Or maybe alien Jon Travolta's gonna come into frame, equally scary.
Is it just me or does the narrator sound like Mickey Mouse •>•
U got to many ads on this vid... srry Danny
1:10  This basically summarises all of Troom trooms life hacks
i don't think troom troom has ever actually tried to give smart life hacks
3:02 I can't explain why, but Danny saying that the kidnapper was playing with matches so seriously had me laughing. It shouldn't be funny to me, but it is.
We have waited eons for another fabled trying troom troom video, the time has come.
You got to love how Troom Troom say are you getting strangled like it happens ever day
Bro Skyler got mean Stockholm Syndrome
Just do every video like this
Subscribed and notifications are on but waiting for the most important notification to tell me I'm officially truly Greg...
YES MORE TROOM TROOM BY DANNY WOOOHOOO
why is calling a gun a criminal is the most funniest thing I've ever heard
okay but imagine getting kidnapped and somehow one of these troom troom hacks saves ur life how cringe lmao
I can't believe that troom trooms used to be a craft channel
TO CRUSH HIM
I almost couldn’t finish this video bc of the narrators voice. 🤢
Nobody talking about how the kidnappers had a PS5 and not a TV
Danny not knowing about the duct tape hack and then being surprised when it worked is killing me. XD
I love you Danny, but the narrators voice was way too annoying to waych
I think you're only supposed to breathe in once the chains are on so you create more space in between, otherwise it's even tighter when you're trying to escape 😂
Danny being offended by nick telling him it was easy 22:24
I thought it was Kurtis jumping out of the truck and got so excited.
I’m dissatisfied I just started kidnapping and I thought I could get some tips and tricks
oh it's not about how to kidnap someone *clicks off video*
This video had the energy of "Roses are red, violets are blue, i have a gun, get in the van."
She just killed a man lol desurved it tho
NICK
Stockholm syndrome much?
Most YouTubers are lizard people but not Danny.
Nick looks so done with it lol
“And criminals are guns” I’m-
"I don't know how likely it is for kidnappers to leave you with matches"   Maybe, but the police in Paradise always leave you with a box of matches when they put you in jail.
one of dannys funnies videos in a while lol
Do you think Danny has yummy feet?
hell yeah Danny finally uploaded
Imagine a big youtuber asks for a collab, and asks you to tie him up multiple times
Haven’t laughed this much in a long time
it really feels like nick and danny have this kidnapper-victim kinda sexual tension going on throughout the video and idk what to think of that (especially at 22:43) lmaooo
I really like the tree frog shirt 🐸
When I was a kid, my best friend and I would take turns tying each other up and figuring out how to get out of it just in case we ever got kidnapped. I’ve never been kidnapped but I guess it was good practice.
23:29 - Danny became Chloe for a moment.
Was absolutely pissing myself the whole video A+ Danny
Danny, billy eyelash? Who knows! Lets just watch this wacky video and get kidnaped! Yay! So goofy silly and quirky! 🤪🤪😜😜🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
*doctors when boys are born* 15:07
Imagining kidnappers leaving for a casual quincenera made me laugh so hard
Yo i love nicki snot green
Lol the kidnapper that is called Kevin looks like Call me Kevin XD
Drew looks different.
I am a kidnapper and this video has given me many tips!  Thanks danny!
what the eff with the duct tape????????????????
Why is there Sims 3 music in the background Danny
or.... just don't get kidnapped, or, just be a adult.
Hello
your inhaler poster reminded me to take my inhaler
bruh i met you on my birthday and i wanna be in one of your videos so badddd. i follow nick i didn’t know y’all knew each other
my tail is wagging and shi...
“Ah he’s back!” Probably one of my favorite skits
I literally have daily nightmares about being taken somewhere against my will and these bitches be buying their captors televisions and playstations.
Not sure if anyone else was irrationally annoyed by this but it’s pronounced “ah-ree-ve-dare-chee”. It does not rhyme with Hershey
Y'all should make a song together  Nick makes really good music
That "ahh! He's back!" made me laugh so fucking hard.
kidnappers: *takes notes*
Nice one Martin! real good chloroform technique kevin!
THAT'S NOT HOW SAFETY MATCHES WORK  Like, the vast majority of matches nowadays no longer have all the reactives on the match head : one of them - red phosphorus - is on the actual strip, which ensures that the match only lights when you WANT it to
Why is The Sims 3 music playing in the background?
i feel like if i ever get kidnapped im gonna try and brainstorm about how to escape but all ill be able to think about is this video
Felice aderrR CHIIi
im amazed by the scotch tape one
the lengths artists will go for their art
She FUVCKING SNAPPED HIS NECK
Hello Danny my name is Greg
gli italiani che guardano questo video a mezza notte è ventisei hahahahhahaa
Does anyone else craft so much with hot glue that you can’t really feel the heat? Like I could feel fine while touching the nozzle of the glue gun while my fingers turn bright red
Oh god troom troom
All the dislikes are from stans who wanted to see his bare feet but couldn't
The shit you so for video homie
Omfg I think I've never laughed so loud, this video is everything
I feel like I needed a trigger warning for this
The duck tape hack is true but you should aim to hit around your hip not your chest . it also works if your are tied with zip ties
When nick was tied up he turned into a fucking dinosaur and stood up
The real question is if hack 4 works on duct tape.
I clicked off when I realized it wasn't about how to kidnap
I used to be like,” Who is this kid?” Now I just officially subscribed and became Greg. Thanks Danny!
Your ski mask looks like dolphin man
hey greg ily
I thought the breaking of the duct tape was a bit more commode knowledge lol you can actually do the same if your hands are zip-tied. You just tighten them as much as you can by grabbing the bit hanging off with your teeth, and then do the same motion as with the duct tape 😁
Jewish docters be like 15:06
Love the r2d2 toy in the background in the dungeon.
Danny I can't believe you missed the opportunity to call the criminals "sons of guns"
I wonder what the guy that asked about the firework would say if he saw danny being chocked in the car lol
Here we go again…
9:43 Forced a stranger to capture me and I can confirm this move killed them.
Lmao
Am watching this video from my kidnapper phone thank u troom troom
I cried laughing when danny slowly moved his seat back to crush him, and he just casually moves.
I feel like everyone's sleeping on the whole 'square knot' bit I thought that was hilarious lmfao
As a victim of a kidnapping i can confirm...   These hacks do not work.
I love the Sims 3 background music 🙏
Fun fact: All of these hacks are based on real kidnapping cases. For example, the one about the matches was based on this one time when a woman in Austin, Texas was kidnapped by two brothers and I'm totally lying this is just dumb.
Oh, so I'm supposed to crush them with my car seat now? Good thing my car doubles as a hydraulic press!
“The twap is awmowst weady” I hate it here 😂
LOL your like the only guy you can make me laugh, great video as always
he reminds me of a cuter more respectable lip gallagher
i watched nicks stream first but dont worry danny you only had 699 viewers stole
“I have to cut the tip off” That’s what she said
was great good night
I cannot believe the tape one worked. I was so sure that was faked
12:47 killed me ☠️  Then he started choking on the fibers and I broke all my ribs laughing at him 🤣
He'd be a wonderful uh, Idk what he was trying to be with the mask lmao.
Lol yes
I lost it at “*pant* now I crush his bones *pant*”
Danny has noticed my efforts to try and kidnap him, i'll get you Gonzalez soon...soon
I did the duct tape myself and I am stuck rn. Help
Wait till Danny finds out you can also do the same get out of tape trick with zip ties
Kevin hit the most devious lick of all time!!
The Little “yababababa” at 4:48 is from South Park
I thought it was about tips on how to kidnap people
I never thought I’d actually miss the original  troom troom lady!
9:10was a jojo reference
I thought I was watching drew gooden
Danny is absolutely right, it's all about the ambiance  LOL I love the other guy in this video but did miss seeing Drew
at least I know if I’m ever kidnapped I just need to buy them a tv and they’ll let me go, thank you troom troom
By the way Danny: "scotch" is what we call duct tape in tons of countries Europe :) that's probably why they called it scotch tape
These videos are very helpful for me and the others in the kidnapping community.
Stockholm syndrome. They all have  Stockholm syndrome.
He's really out here doing it wrong it's hurting my brain
I'm so annoyed the person I kidnapped didn't even leave me a TV
Create a Sim - Verisimilitude (Sims 3)
The person who narrates these videos has lost her will to live, you can hear it.
fun fact: modern matches are called safety matches, because they can only be striked on the box, and not on the wall or anywhere else
hello?
8:07 There is a small glitch.
that breathing trick is a valid one, Harry Houdini used something similar in his straitjacket escapes, but they greatly over-exaggerate the amount of give that trick gives you
I already knew about the duct tape one, but troom troom really failed hard at describing the actual steps.
this just feels like things i would probably do with my friends at a sleepover when i was like 11
12:36 hitman igloo tree long eagle red?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I’m 43 but you crack me up!
Danny not being able to hold his breath without puffing his cheecks like a 5 year old is the funniest thing ever
Why does the "gotcha girlie!" at the start kinda sound like mickey mouse
Hey, there’s this really weird movie you should look at, it’s called “Rapsittie Street Kids believe in Santa.” The animation might actually be the worst I’ve seen.
Idk why but i thought nick was short so seeing him here blew my mind
I miss the old narrator’s voice. This one makes my teeth hurt.
The whole thing with the duct tape is that it has to be flat. If the duct tape rolls you can't break it
This is the funniest video I’ve watched in a long time. Thanks Dan the man!
"Are you getting strangled" Geez i laughed hard!!  How the hell would you answer to that?!
i didn’t even notice this was a new video 😳😳
Anyone else feel a little sick listening to that narrator? ☹
NICK NICK NICK NICK NICK
Always a good day when Danny uploads 😊
Does snapping someone’s neck kill them?  -Questions by Danny
sheeee
22:30 this look right here..
This feels like a 2019 Danny video that I somehow missed
That technique used to break the duct tape also works for zipties iirc
Not the Sims 3 music 😂
Watch it girly!
27:35 Gotta love supportive kidnapper Nick explaining to Danny how to free himself
the reason the last one actually worked was because troom troom didn't come up with it, it's kind of well known and there's a lot of 'how to escape' videos that are serious and made by people who know what they're doing lmaoo
To be fair,you can actually pay to be kidnapped (as well as other things) ,you'd be perfectly safe but it would happen at a random time,I'd assume it creates a bit of chaos in a mundane life. Maybe that's why they were given a TV and made it easy to escape,idk
Thanks! This helps alot
What's funny is that I've seen a bunch of other videos involving the duct tape. I knew ahead of time that was a real tactic (though troom troom demoed it wrong)
can i kidnap u >~< :3
Isn't that a very dangerous kind of video for them to release? Claiming these things would work in what *_can_* be a life or death situation is a very bold claim.
Who else got legitimately hype when the duct tape hack worked?
Notifications on!!
yeah hit it danny of the crafting corner!
taking LIFE hacks to the literal sense
nick my beloved!
Now I'm terrified that Troom Troom will try to Gregnap me
Nick kinda fin-
UMM BEST VIDEO EVERR???? HELL YEA
My car seat can only be reclined by turning that little wheel on the side, so I guess my chances of surprising and crushing my attacker are pretty slim there lol
Jojo reference?
this is both the stupidest and funniest video ive ever watched
bondage boys
nick with the ski mask covering his eyes but the glasses still over it is never going to stop being funny to me
5:15😂😂😂
Danny is really starting to look like Ellen these days...                                  Damn...   smh
"Kevin's not bored, if you have a box of matches you can think of so many games!" Wtf is this channel clearly aimed at young children encouraging playing with matches? Are they actively trying to get people killed?
What happened at 8:05
This narrator is getting on my nerves
Why is the narrator making her voice _higher-pitched_ for the male criminals??
“And I’m definitely not gonna exposing my bare feet on camera for free for you sickos..” well he didn’t say not for money 😏...
Danny- You were supossed to breathe in and with your body and stuff, not hold air in your bouth lol
The narrator's voice actually makes me want to stop watching
You finally did it
The new troom troom voice makes my ears bleed ;-;
Toe socks 🤢
Lmfao like fr
The fucking narrator is driving me insane
Who else's eyes opened real wide when they through her on the bed I was like Oop
Fun fact, the duct tape method also works if only a ziptie is used. It will hurt more, yes, but it will work
We missed u Danny boyyyy!
These aren’t that awful, I can say this coming from background experience.
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU PLZ PRACTICE GETTING KIDNAPPED MORE
Did no one realize that in the first hack she just melted the zip tie and left, like the door wasn’t even locked 💀
To be fair, that TV may not have been new. It wasn't in a box. 🧡💜
Nick went hard with that choke, not his first time I think.
Further proof that Troom Troom kidnapped the blue-eyed girl
the narrator's voice is legitimately giving me a migraine omg
More trooms
8:50 yeah no troom troom got that from Houdini
22:16
idk danny, nick seemed to have some ulterior motive to kidnap you and conveniently sat in your car and waited for the exact day you would be wearing a scarf... stay safe brother <3
Luckily the troom troom narrator is identifying each kidnapper by name. So I think we have enough to bring these guys to justice!!!
Danny should have snapped the bad guy's neck and saved the day.
The car thing you should kick in the back light
Why do they have the same run?
5:14 *major flashbacks to aki in chainsaw man*
12:24 proof that danny is the new Daredevil.
the way they got so excited when the ‘scotch’ taped worked was so cute
The thing with the duct tape does work but it’s pretty hard and it hurts
*You may have saved somebody’s life with this video lol. Thank you Danny!!!!* :)   😂😂😊💖💗💖👍
why is nick everywhere now but tbh i’m glad he’s growing
I was actually just thinking about how I missed the troom troom videos :o
Greg
Arivederci is like good afternoon in Italian as an Italian I can confirm
Gotta get strike anywhere matches
Danny and co discovering the actual recommended method of breaking duct tape around your wrists in hilarious. Like, that's how you're supposed to do it, or you can also slam your elbows down on either side of your knee if you're positioned with your knees to your chest.
Ok but are we not going to address the outro song disappearance?
This was funny  😂😂😂
It workefred >:)
Why was there a Alexa on the wall
If you have a box of matches, you can think of *so many games*!  - Troom Troom 2021
"I felt like I was choking you for a while there, like."  *"Yeah you were"*  😭
The narrator's voice got somehow even worse. My ears are bleeding.
“What’re we gunna do for the narration?”   “Imagine Princess Peach, but 100x more annoying.”
not you playing the sims 3 music in the background
i love how nick wore the "mask" as a beanie
Most matches you'll find in everyday life are "safety matches".  They can only be lit when struck against a specially prepared friction surface.  The material on the match head has to be combined with chemicals in the striking surface to cause the chemical reaction leading to the fire.  There are "non-safety" matches (aka "strike anywhere matches") that can be lit on any kind of dry surface with enough friction, but they tend to be just a bit more dangerous because they can in principle inadvertently be lit when they rub against things like the side of their box or other matches.
As Bruno Bucciarati once famously said, “Arrivederci, losers.”
Danny... did you use Sims 3 music?
WHY
Amogus fungus
A whole 31 minutes of Drew, and I don’t have to press another video Fantastic!
i liked the part where he had to cut the tip off
Nick really collabing with everyone. You love to see it. Also in the first trick (with the matches) they just left the ‘cell’ door open??
Did anyone else notice the kidnapper smell the chain? Hahaha
Petition for Danny to talk about the Nickelodeon movie "Swindled", please Danny!!
30:00 i like my phone naked
19:06 the way Danny looked at Nick omg 😭
The fact that the entire robber family are deadass wearing ski masks even as babies lmfao
Danny learned how to tie a square knot at camp. Camp unplug
why
FINALY
Kidnapped=car=leave car=free
Nick supremacy
I love how Troom Troom's videos were somehow able to get significantly worse throughout the years, I didn't even know that was possible.
I like that criminal Danny taped up on the wall
Nick rlly made this vid
tie me up like I’m surprise, that’s role play I wear disguise
very epic
Alright, we got the Kurtis Korner, the Update Corner and the Crafting Corner. What’s next lol
Yes actually u put one hand on the back of their neck and one on their forehead with ur thumb right behind thier ear push with ur thumb and pull thier head both ways it will crack thier neck putting person in pain and the pressure behind the ear makes them release
Jesus Christ the narrator makes me angry
27:23 i too appreciate when my kidnappers give me a motivational speech to help me escape
Awesome, now I know how to kidnap the right way! I'll be much more successful next time! 😃Thanks Danny!
Nick is surprisingly skillful at being a kidnapper and kidnappee
Quality content
I always like to buy my murderer a new house after they murder me to repay them for the experience 😊
Yay now I can make the 104 kids in my basement that I forced to subscribe to me, now I can have 10,000,000 🤣
Nobody: Troom troom: "I'm being kidnapped 🥰😋🤪🤪✨💝"
The Alexa being on the wall was so good
This is going from “terrible things no one needs” to “literally advice that can get you killed”
this video was so beautiful and amazing I genuinely couldn't stop laughing you should make more videos with nick
We can be glad if Danny gets kidnapped he knows some tips
aright we have kurtis centuar, danny centuar, and all thats left is drew centuar
I love these videos because whenever I’m getting strangled and kidnapped my kidnapper always lets me whip out my phone and search up troom troom hacks to escape him.
Who is that robber he’s super hot. Sadly he’s not green.
13:55 wdym for free😳😳😳
Troom Troom is actually actively giving you advice on how to get yourself killed  Still monetized mind you
The reason that matches need the strip on the matchbox to light is that it has a special mineral in it that heats up from rubbing the match on it
The narrators voice is literally drilling holes into my skull
beuaismska
Can someone kidnap me so I can try this out real quick?
troom's insanely weird computer generated compu voice is bizaare enough, but the scenarios they put these people in while the computer narrator usese her distinct "ALways emphasize the HIGH syllables when you're being KIDNAPPED" is so god damn offputing and strange...one of the best hate watch channels there is. glad this is being marketed to 7 year olds, my 6 year old hates his entire generation's abuse of youtube and that gives me hope. "Dad , do people actually watch this for the information?" No son...I replied...never in a billion years.
I love all the coaching the kidnapped is doing in Danny's skits.
I hate it when I drop my phone and it shatters into 100,000 pieces
I started choking at the neck snap part
Omg this was hilarious baaahaha and that frog shirt brings back so many memories lol
I swear i've seen this before but it was only uploaded today
3 VIDS IN A MONTH??? Wow
i know the duct tape one- it was so funny seeing danny not believe it at first
15:31 brown people: am I a joke to you
I died when I saw nick choking u
LMFAO i dropped my phone right when you started talking about dropping phones
won't get your feet out for free but will make an entire BDSM video for free
i enjoyed this video so much , nick and danny make a great team :-D
when danny took in that first breath at 21:15, i cried laughing
suntitles please?
whos the green looking guy?
the last hack also works really well with zipties
I'm laughing so hard at the ski mask being so uneven and you can see his entire face lol
31:15 Wtf danny
Why does the narrators voice sound like Mickey Mouse??? It’s deeply upsetting.
“It’s obvious he’s in love with her!”  Ah yes reverse Stockholm syndrome
Troom Troom kidnapping videos are like my recurring childhood nightmares
hold on for an mf second. how am i supposed to know when the video is over ?
man, these life hacks are *seriously intense*
21:48 ur welcom
got kidnapped :/
Danny : being shocked by someone behind him me : 😳😳😳
3 videos per month? Who is this and what did he do to Danny
danny looked so concerned while getting strangled. the rapid breathing and the way his mouth was open when he was trying to breathe really pulled everything together
at least you didn’t have a bag on your head in costal rica like drew did
Teaching kids that if you become a kidnapper you’ll get a Flat Screen tv
I hope you know that all that coughing earned you a whole like from me, that was hilarious 😂
Me:Reads title AlsoMe:Sounds like troom troom to me
Ngl I’ll be thinking about how the duct tape thing actually worked for the next few hours
ive heard both the tensing yourself up thing and the duct tape thing before. idk the validity of the first but tt definitely did an awful job explaining whats actually good advice
Why did this make my laugh so hard
that duct tape thing looks really fun wtf
i literally cannot stop laughing at his balaclava plus him choking oh my god
I love guy. (this one)
3:07 honey- those socks-    the toes-
How dare you interrupt my Squid game YouTube conspiracy binge. Tf otta here hot stuff.
Why does Danny sound exactly like drew at 11:53   At this point you truly can’t deny that they’re the same person
Wait so they never fired the original narrator? Why do they need another one who always sounds like she's doing an impression of a mickey mouse character then
now thats a name i havent heard in a while
danny why were you playing sims 3 creat a sim music at the start of ur video
5:25 is my favorite part
the crafting corner… like the update corner… oh how i miss it..
You would need strike anywhere matches lol
This will hopefully really help Danny escape from Obamas house 😔
Danny, you forgot to put a big hole in the back of the mask like in troom trooms video
WHY DID HE SNIFF THE CHAIN IM DYING
I literally cried, this was so funny
This is my favorite video you’ve made king
Where is the iconic “This video is over now (over now)
It's feels like terrible idea 😅 ...  Just glad you okay Danny
“That mAy save your life”
new video new video new video
“Catcha girly” is something i never thought i would hear in my life
I actually thought they made tips on how to kidnap someone
Why is she talking like that how is she getting paid to talk like that. I have so many questions
That one hack where you tense and release after being tied is a classic magician’s trick actually haha, you do it with escape tricks etc.
waiting for "how to get out of multiple accounts of murder life hacks"
this video is a masterpiece thank you
Danny is the best youtuber
the two tufts of hair that stick out of the "mask" when nick is not wearing it, is hilarious, I also love the fact he just put the glasses on over the mask instead of just taking them off
Troom Troom life hacks: not the ones you wanted, that’s about it
Danny you look like a real Chad 😎
Why was using your muscles to break the duck tape arousing??
“Gotcha girly!” Ah yea, *gotcha! I kidnapped ya girl! I did it yeaaa!*
Brb, gonna run to the store and buy some toe socks!
is no one going to mention the sims music??
As someone who has been kidnapped by guns i can confirm that toe socks are very useful
Btw, on life #4 what you are gonna do is tense yourself, put your arms straight up and then try to hit your stomach.
definitely one of Dannys best videos omg
Love the sims music. Beautiful undertone to this insane video.
I hadn't laughed this hard in a video for a while :')
i think like puffing your chest to make it so their chain is looser when they tie it would work but i think they'd notice you doing that and just wait for you to exhale or hit you in the stomach
9:24 Made me die laughing for a solid two minutes
When I saw the title I thought it meant like life hacks for how to kidnap someone
I surprised Danny didn't say anything about the sliced mannequin (9:09)
The real ones saw the end
Danny holding breath...."Should I do a Double?".....im dead lol.
Thank you for this video
ngl i thought this was gonna be tutorials for how to kidnap not escape a kidnapping gjfnfjfn
31:15
Woah
Danny said "match game" like 3 times In this video, and not ONE reference to the show. Your slipping Danny.
I’m having an unbelievably good time rn
the toe socks bother me so much
What!??
since when does drew wear glasses 🤔
3360th
8:37 but Emily watches Houdini-
I want to get kidnapped now, kidnappers are chill
“Here within an hour”
29:49 Danny is that fucking ahegao
Ah . Just like the good old days
Nickisnotgreen gives me a pleasurable time
Did you get strike-anywhere matches or safety matches? That might explain why they aren't lighting.
Nick is so Fing nervous
This was so funny, thank you for this FOOD
😃 >))<      <---- MAN   I  \
If im ever kidnapped id just go limp. I am 300 pounds
I'm subscriber
this is amazing
wow I'm actually early for something
Thank you for this birthday gift, Danny
hi
***uses a match*** Danny : [the match] makes a match sound 😃
"Are you getting strangled?"  .......yeeeeeah.  Should have been wearing your velcro scarf, my man!
No, the neck snapping doesn’t work. It’s not as easy as it looks in movies. I did a self defense course two weeks ago and I facepalmed several times while watching this video.
13:16 Griffith after betraying the band of the hawk
This will soon be like his third most popular video
Not Danny not inviting Drew to this little adventure with Nick 😭
nickisnotgreen, your friendly, neighborhood kidnapper 😌
the fist life hack could been easier the door was open she could just wait for them to leave and then open the door with her body without hands
A variation of the duck tape technique does actually work, Tim Kennedy has a video on it. I tried it myself, unfortunately I did so alone and used extra strong bonding tape and wrapped it too many times. I had to wait like 4 hours until my GF came home and when she was arrived it was with a big black guy named Tay’sheon. We all laughed about the situation, then he stole my PlayStation 5 and banged my girlfriend in front me, which I wasn’t thrilled about.  I also was disappointed that she kept complimenting him on the size of his penis, although to be fair he was very well endowed.   Moral of the story: buy an Xbox Series X because your PS5 will just be stolen by Tay’sheon.
hello not to say danny is lying he probably just had a different experience but i recently ordered a rhinoshield case and it was super expensive, the print was oddly low quality and the phone case way too bulky. i had to pay for the return delivery and it was overall not a great experience. just fyi
Classic TROOM Troom
🦆tape is called 🥈(silver) tape in the Nordic countries. More apt, really
13:36 thats what she said
I’m kidnapped Of course I’m not ok…  I’m scared.   *wink*
So good XD I'm literally dying omfg HAHAHAHAHAHA This is one of my favorites so far
Geldhwreg
early gang
This vid actually made both my mom and me laugh till I cried- we love your sense of humor and editing style! I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard😂
It's space tape, not scotch tape or duct tape
The narrator is the girl version of the narrator of Top5 YouTube channel
4:24 Is this reverse Stockholm syndrome? Is that a thing?
The scotch tape trick is a legitimate trick actually! So at least they got that going for them lol
Troom Troom needs to Stop™️. Unrelated, but I love when you widen the footage for comedic effect.
Why yes, yes I am being strangled    voluntarily  *in troom troom voice*
So....in the troom troom world kidnapping is a common occurrence
The second life hack actually works. A girl escaped her kidnapper by straining her face when he was putting a cloth around her eyes. So she could see when they were driving.
0:22 sounds like one of those bad actors in an animated movie lol
this is the most i’ve laughed today. it’s my 16th birthday and my grandpa died this morning. it’s been a really rough day for my family and i. thank you for lightening it up danny
With your wrists your can do the same one with the cable ties
Im so excited for this video
the dollar store metal gear sound 💀
3,285th !!!!!!!!!!11!!!!1!!!
Nick was having none of it. I’m just here trying to casually accept these two being together.
first
I absolutely don't understand who troom troom's target audience is, except for Danny and all of us dumb Gregs of course
a little too much goofing around for the main channel
I think this is my favourite video on this channel (Nick might be a big factor in that, you two got great chemistry)
I tried, they dont work
Troom trooms channel must be run by Steve Brule. "If you get kidnapped in a car, just get out dummy! For your health..."
please do more things with randos watching
GET TO 5M SUB'S DANNY YOU GOT THISSSSSSSSSS
Wait there is an alternate universe where there are life hacks FOR kidnappers to be better kidnappers
This is the funniest video holy shit
Aren't you supposed to breathe out and make yourself as big as possible when being tied up so you have a bigger gap to escape?
Truly traumatizing? Tru truam? Troom Troom?
ive literally been binging your videos for the past day or so and most recently the troom troom trilogy and its so weird that you come out with this just as a finished by binge lmao
the narration in the videos unnerves me so much. "that's genius kevin!!🥰🥰"
Actually, I don't need any defense training to become a police officer.  I watched Troom Troom's survival saga 💁‍♀️😌
Fun fact, those are safety matches, and they were never gonna work on the wall. A lot of countries banned the kind that can strike anywhere in the 1870s. The US didn’t ban them but they’re not commonly made. Your kidnapper would have to special order them for you to use in your escape.
gotcha girlie 😱
It's a catch twenty troom
Good timing, I needed another, great video by Danny before sleep
Nick kinda cute tho 😫😫😫
imagine the people around them just watching three guys doing this. one of them strutting around in a really long scarf, another one in a ski mask, and another filming the whole thing.
neet
These DIY channels getting a bit more....  Kinky? 🤔
Hey wait, this guy’s kinda funny
I am already laughing just from reading the title
Wait, I’m confused. If Nick is the kidnapper, why isn’t he wearing a balaclava?
"They are legally not allowed to chase you" BAHAHHAHAHAH
She just stops caring at 10:05
i- is- is that sims 3 music in the beginning of the video 😃⁉️
You can break almost anything on your wrists with that hit your body with extended arms technique. Even zip ties and stuff.
Woah I’m early
That's the beauty of troom troom..become an expert in hostage negotiations, while mastering children's crafts simultaneously. Impressive....
The chicken wing trick with the duct (scotch) tape around your wrists, also works with a single zip tie around both wrists.  Source: dad has worked with cops for like 20 years.
The breaking duct tape was edited in on the troom troom vid LMAO
Can Laura use these to escape that well?
The voice actor for Ralph from the Simpson’s career really went downhill
2:43 Sasha Waybright, probably:
Btw a duck tape hack actually works they demonstrated it now basically you have to put your elbows together put them high up together then swing them down as hard as you can and pull them apart it works. Danny did it right the video troom troom video didn’t
new favorite video check ✅
LMFAO THE SIMS 3 MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING
Ur so funny bro love u so much keep up the great work
the narrator gets more annoying every single time…
Haha love it! You’ve done it again Danny :)
Literally can’t watch this video cuz of the troom troom narration voice lol
budget kidnapper
One time my sister crushed me with a car seat and I can say with confidence it works very well
i hate to say it but the old narrator was better
21:15 kinky
Wtf are those socks
If they need Gunsallus liked my comment I will cry
13:31 You would look like Batman if he was poor
you and nick should make more videos together, i was dying of laughter
bro her fucking socks have the toes....
That duct tape trick is actually a well known escape tool for being kidnapped, troom troom just fucked up the demonstration and instructions... as they often do, but im glad danny and his bud figured out the right technique!
nick was waiting on this video to get revenge for danny whacking his cats every baddie smp
It's not KIDNAPPING. it's deviously licking someone. Get with it, Danny.
I cant believe troom troom had an actually useful hack this time
Hi, I love you.
I subscribed and turned on notifications, am I truly Greg?
It brought me so much joy to see their excitement over the duct tape trick actually working
Next up: I Changed My Identity and made it into a troom troom video.
Aribadurchi losers   >:)
the way everyone pronounced arrivaderchi hurt me
Gerg
Anybody's going to notice this 8:08
Doing yard work
13:56 I love how he said “I’m definitely not going to expose my bare feet on camera FOR FREE for you sickos”
Dannyboooooyyyyt when are you going to stream again???❤️❤️❤️
Is the narrator also kidnapped? It sounds like she's being held at gunpoint to hype up the kidnappers.
I see Drew is trying a more deadly version of that scarf life hack from his other video with his wife
Hi
Me acting like watching a kidnapping video hack at 5 am is not a weird thing to do.
14:23 danny thee stallion
The the sims 3 song in the background
I thought they were gonna be life hacks about how to kidnap someone
i love how nick put his glasses over his mask despite not being able to see through the mask
is it just me or is like the troom troom video kind of insensitive
I can't stop laughing at the choking scene, the way Nick moved out the way, the commentary
🌸☀️💖✨🌈"Are you getting strangled!?"🌸☀️💖✨🌈  ..."yeah"  That made me laugh way too hard lmao
troom troom be like: tIe sOmEoNe iN a RoCkEt fUeL jEt
i'm really digging the sims 3 create a sim music danny
hardest ive laughed in ages
I have never been this early
Oh yeah, the duct tape part totally works.  That's a legit method, I'm pretty sure I've heard it before.
I just subscribed to Nick last night! Cool guy!
I gotta hand it to Troom Troom and all their sister channels for consistently coming up with this kind of content. It takes talent to be this weird.
Omg a hack with fabric glue: “The silly glue won’t come out! Luckily Danny watches Troom Troom to know what to do. Grab some scissors and place it next to the tip. Move the scissors so it makes a hole on the top. 😃”
One of the most important tactical videos ever made. Don't know why the government would leak these secrets
love the sims music
That is a very nice corner Danny
alternate title: danny tries out kinky life hacks with nick
Danny I love the way you say dungeon like that
Dany
You couldn’t light the match on the wall because now most matches are safety matches that can only be lit using the lighting surface on the box
That intro is so oddly intriguing
I subscribed and turned on notifications a while ago but never commented about it. Am I still truly Greg?
love the costa rica tourist shop shirt. i didnt even know people actually bought those
no bc why does the narrator sound like bubbles from powerpuff girls-
I put on notifications am i Greg now?
The work Danny has been putting in his videos lately has been really showing. 10/10, Five Star Video :)
WHY IS SHE WEARING TOE SOCKS HELP
But the crafting corner didn’t even hurt his knees 😡
The create a sim music really gets me going ngl
i love how nick is basically bullying him the whole time
The series is back!!!
It’s annoying that Troom Troom is just leaning into the ridiculousness because they know it got them attention. Like that voice is turned up to 11 million.
I still miss the stupid song
this is the best video i've seen in a WHILE
The next life hack will be “do a backflip, snap the bad guys neck and save the day”
Danny I just need you to know i have never cried so much laughing at a video I’m my life... this was an amazing video
19:00 i'm just imagining someone gets kidnapped and they fail so badly at escaping that the kidnapper has to help them
Amazing ive benn waiting for another one
love that you had to cut the scarf down the middle instead of just putting the velcro on the ends of the scarf 💀
Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day
These kidnapper suck
Forget the KGB, troom troom is the real Russian intelligence agency
Danny I need to know where you got that shirt
Let's just sit back and let this channel create an entire generation of very easily kidnapped children. What's the worst that could happen?
NICKK 🌟🌟🌟 easilyy one of my fav videos
Groog
whenever danny posts my happiness boosts to the max
The Moment I saw this video, I clicked, and Im commenting this before I finish the video
I thought the title meant that it was teaching you how to kidnap
Hello Danny.
All you have to do is tell the kidnappers that you never got to tell Danny you loved him. At least that’s what worked for Drew when he was kidnapped and taken to Costal Rica
danny just broke the laws of physics
They played the toe match game so hard 😫
Someone show these to Amanda in Afghanistan
Good thing they’re wearing ski masks- no way they could be identified with those giant holes cut out
Danny in his previous video: I'm tryna be dominated Glad his wish came true
gotcha girlie 😂😍😙😜😎
This video gives off-brand unus annus energy
I always watch Danny’s troom troom videos I’m glad there’s another one
“IT’s scaly it’s covered in scales!”  *AHEM LIZARD PROPLE JAKE PAUL FLAT EARTH?!*
Troom Troom is on a whole other level that simple minds like ours just wouldn’t understand 😔
Project MC square said the duct-tape thing. Its kind of a known thing
Great, just fucking great, now Danny is uncaptureable. Thanks for nothing Troom Trooms
Aaaaa my favoritee series
The narrators voice is giving me a headache
Nick got his revenge for the cat…
I LAUGHED SO MUCH I THREW MY 7 MONTH SISTER ON THE FLOOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The scotch tape hack actually working is the greatest plot twist I never would have expected from Troom Troom.
this is like danny wanted to play pretend and nick just went along with it
8:07 I thought I was having a seizure
Just make your bones squishy and squeeze through the bars
7:04 Eric André cameo.
troom troom is saving lives
11:33
I love how when they cut back to the criminal on the wall there’s like 3x the tape holding it there lmao
did the … narrator get more annoying to u guys or am i trippin
When everyone thinks Danny’s a typical bad boy who sets off fire works and catches buildings on fire
No one: Literally no one: Danny: *aggressively coughs*
I really like the part at 4:46 where she remembers she’s on camera and brushes the hair out of her face
This was his funniest video yet
danny: why dont they just use fabric glue? me: bc they were so stupid they didnt know they were supposed to cut the tip of the bottle lmaoo
I literally started crying from laughing so hard during the scarf segment
WHAT IS OwO???
That mask looks like it was cut out for Venom
Already hear several nails being dragged on a chalkboard while someone crushed styrofoam together then listen to the narrator's voice
Where's the song? 😐😠
4:22 this is stockholm syndrome but reversed, what do you even call this...
nick looks like he was the one kidnapped to the basement
Is that Sims 3 music in the background in the begging of the video? I might be losing my mind, please help ahhah
for anyone wondering, arrivederci means "until we meet again" in italian. the kidnapee basically just said "come kidnap me again losers"
Ah yes, because every single person in this comment section is kidnapped as an everyday occurrence! Truly brilliant for bringing the Gregs this helpful service.
Oh, 42 minutes ago. Not 3 years ago... 🙂
Lol him not knowing how to use fabric glue amused me
Man really used PK fire on himself for a thumbnail
arivaderchy sounds like something a sim would say
No…..stahp……my head hurts 😓
Me: born My parents : 15:15
Very excited for the CPAFTING COPNEP
WHY WAS I SQUINTING AT THE THUMBNAIL LIKE “is that our beanie king himself??? NICKISNOTGREEN?!?!?”
I am GREG
Wait Danny has friends?
this got kinky ⊙.☉
"Are you getting ✨strangled✨??? ☺☺"
As a kidnapper, I can approve that these do not work
imagine your life being worth a TV 😂
Im pritty shure the duc- "scotch tape" one is a real ecsape methed.
I just noticed the kidnappers have a ps5. Or at least a controller
Come on, you ignorant git.  Everybody knows Arrivederci means toe socks in Italian...
omg what is troom troom doing
This video was not suppose to be as funny as it was
Lmao that mortal kombat 11 drawing is just good
5:37 Uh uh “I kill people, *schklikt, klikt*, with guns. POW!
The thing for breaking duct tape also works with zip ties, fyi. Probably the only valuable piece of advice Troom Troom ever dispensed, even though they showed the entirely wrong way to do it
It’s very hard to snap someone’s spinal cord like that, but you might be able to relieve your attackers neck pain and they’ll be so grateful they’ll let you go.
I wish 7 year old me had Danny to teach me how to avoid getting kidnapped, would've saved me that bit of trauma smh
9:07 ok why is there a naked mannequin on the floor
I can’t believe that duct tape one.
I'm early! =D
Danny! I love your videos. I think you should react to rise of kingdom adds.
Alternative title: Danny getting tortured for your entertainment
15:14 sounds wrong
so when are they going to realize that the duck tape hack is actually real and is taught in self-defense classes lmaooo-- it works on zip ties too
This video made me laugh so hard i started crying and couldn’t breathe, now i’m literally dead
Aww omg Drew and Nicks first ever collab🥰❤️💕
Nick and Danny are like brothers, I like this duo
“guns dont kill people, i kill people. with guns.” -music man
I can’t believe Danny didn’t know what strain meant 🤦🏾‍♀️
My god the narrator's voice is CONSIDERABLY more annoying than the previous girl
Danny missed the perfect chance to make a "Help, let me go" reference
いぇええいぇえ
The terror I felt watching danny try to light a match with socked feet thinking he'd light it and the sock would instantly go up in flames ,,, my god man
Troom troom is back and it’s worse.
Martha Stewart is a criminal...shes the BEST at crafts. Just sayin.
kill the kidnapers it is that ez
nick is so cute. why is life this unfair
37 minutes since the Dan man posted and I'm barely commenting under the 3k mark..forget kidnapping, I need a life hack for commenting faster, ya know, stuff that actually matters
hey buddy :)
I want you to LIKE.  　　　　　　　　　だっdy湾tぃけs
i remember seeing the duct tape thing in schitt's creek
Very tempted to be late to my work shift to watch this...
I can only imagine the conversation he had at the craft store
I'm gonna try these hacks alone in my basement
Danny no
dannnyyy I think I saw you on an airplane last week going to Calgary
17:41 nice techfoots danny
Lote your vids! Cant say The same about trom trom.
.
why is nobody talking about the toe socks
The narrator's voice sounds like someone trying to parody a troom troom voice 😭😭😭
9:25 Dudes watching his friend get his neck snapped whilst casually sitting in a chair. Honestly mood.
Wow! What a normal thumbnail.
"I'm getting kidnapped!" *Is immediately followed by a cheerful music*  This shit shouldn't be that funny omfg 😂
captions pls
Future classic video right here
we love danny boy I like to see this video as an educational experience What have we learnt? Every year the Narrator’s voice gets more annoying
The look of fear on Danny's face when the scarf didn't break away immediately is hysterical
break your knees corner- a corner crafting corner- the middle of a room
OK BUT HER SOCKS-
Why does the narrator sound like minnie mouse
so worried about the fumes you're inhaling besties. thanks for at least doing it outside
Here in under 30 minutes
That duct tape hack was insane, holy crap! From beginning to end 😱😱😱
What shoes are those Danny?
Danny Gonzalez is like the first coming of god, but he judges what he has created.
That little bit of toe cleavage bout to make me act up
Omg I needed help with this!
Awsome
these will be useful
Hi
This was really funnt
greg😏
What the hell is this oh my god
man i sure know what they mean by "they mean business"  when i looked in the corner   9:08
I, too, missed Jenna's ratchet boutique!
Imagine being the girl in this video and being asked to do this video. "Okay Molly, for this video, we're gonna have someone kidnap you and tie you up. And they're gonna, like, make you sit on a bed and then use a blanket to escape."
The narrator makes me want to rip my ears off
"are you getting strangled?" says Dumbledore, calmy
Man I love when Danny wears that scarf 😌
Damn, foiled again at free feet footage of Danny.
that sims music lmao
i thought the title was a joke at first but then i remembered it is troom troom
DANNY IS ALIVE
“I’M BEING KIDNAPPED!!!”    *cheerful music plays*
Reminds me of that time two idiots tried to escape a hostage situation in [CHANNEL REDACTED]. Good times. "118"
No not jojo now not the holy anime noooooo
i- im sorry- WHAT KIND OF HACKS?
danny’s facials during this 👌🏻
the kidnappers being criminals as new borns is really funny
So we're all gonna count nick kidnaping Danny as part of the baddie smp lore right?
Damn im early
NOT THE FINGER TOES NOT GLOVES FOR YOUR FEET NO
you know its a good day when danny uploads a troom troom video
Hey Danny where did you get that Tesla from
This video has to make nick greg certified
Nick be looking like the US version of WilburSoot
I did not Expect her to just snap the kidnappers neck
That "tighten your body while being tied up" trick is from the Hardy Boys lol
I assume duct tape was purposely designed to be broken out of
Video was pretty okay, disappointed he didn’t try the neck snapping hack, though. It looks pretty effective and I’m sure Nick would have gotten up just like the guy in the video.
13:36 careful, might get taken out of context-
danny
This is the exact title danny would use if he actually kidnapped someone
Useful steps for kidnappers.  Step 1: Set up a box trap thingy Step 2 : Ignore box thingamajig, grab the victim.  No. I see no redundant steps here.
For some reason I did not expect Nick to be tall, sorry man
What was with the nerds splatter makeup on the first girls face
Is the troom troom narrator Micky Mouse?
Hi I watched this during my kidnapping I appreciate that you showed the accuracy of these hacks
Is that Sims 3 CAS background music
i feel like ive just gone through an ab workout
That duct tape part was kinda fucking cool
Cut troom troom some slack, they had to get kidnappers to kidnap the actors and let them film them!
hello NickisNotGreen and Danny Gonzalez
Damn this video is full of energy glad youre okay now after what happened to your dog drew gonzalez.
Dang I never thought I would see Danny collar with Tenz
itsssss reverse psychology
Yeah... the match thing was never gonna work in most of the world 'cause security matches.  In ye olden days matches worked off friction, but mos matches these days have part of what is needed to light them in the part of the box you strike it against, mostly because the variant of phosphorus in the old fashioned matches isn't all that safe for various reasons, and of course inadvertent ignition is a concern.
still in complete disbelief that the duct tape one worked
The narrator for the first life hack sounds like a Minnie Mouse on a budget
As someone who wasn’t kidnapped I can’t relate
Danny Gonzalez : risking having trauma for a video  YouTube : is this a prank? Because if it isn't I'm not even paying a dollar for this
O.G NEW DANNY VIDEO YAY!!!!
Nick is either taller than I was expecting or Danny is shorter.
Ok, Troom Troom…One thing…WHO TF WEARS TOE SOCKS?!
Like for a cookie
These videos are for adults but sound like they are made for kids
Why
troom troom is like if you're kidnapped just leave
so true
danny just gets younger and younger each video
I thought it was going to be a "How to kidnap" hack video but IG we aren't there yet
troom troom is like a troll that doesn’t know there trolling
I hope the troom troom kidnappers don’t come for Danny 💧😰💧
Danny: Tie me up, Nick Nick: Uhhhh ok yeah thats fine
27:29  the side effects of every medicine commercial
just escape 4Head
actual survivor here let's see how much of this video my ptsd will let me watch
yes
Troom Troom Lady’s voice got worse
danny, this is the funniest fucking video you have ever posted. i am SOBBING in the walgreens parking lot
this might become one of my comfort vids <3
No Danny(s) were harmed in the making of this video   maybe
Damn, no feet today...
Alexis Rose taught me about how to escape having my wrists taped together.
goddamn
Now, time for a field test.
“Honey, 3 PM, time for our Bi-Weekly kidnapping-based fetish routine.”
who hired this narrator. holy crap my ears
The narrator's vocal cords are a living example of 'tHiS vOiCe'
I've never seen anyone more triumphant than when they managed to break the duct tape
nick is a meanie :/
Another life hack is to play a troom troom video at full volume so your kidnappers die from the cringe
Oh yeah, in an hour.
Daughter: mommy mommy! Mom: what’s wrong honey. Daughter: I just escaped from a dungeon full of guns but it was ok! I gave them our tv. I stole some matches too!
6:58 I guess Jack Manifold got a side job as a delivery man
Deeno
the way u looked at nick while he explained why the match sounds like that omg
danny back to his roots ah yes
so amazed that the “scotch tape escape” hack actually worked
Thanks gonna use these the next time I get kidnapped
Minnie Mouse narrating like “good job marTIN you kidnapped a girl”
9:44 If you actually snap someone neck like take it and turn it really fast (or just turn their neck like that) you can kill them. Idk how to explain it in English, but they can die... Troom troom is choosing violence - _ -
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while
Imo the toe match round was the most brutal in the Squid Game
8:43 she could have just stood up. There's nothing stopping the chains from going up and over the barrel
Only Varli and Dolphin Man can save Danny!
Baddie smp irl but Danny would be the villain
3:59  when you have sensory issues and can only wear toe socks: 😎
2:35 wdym? Everybody has a dungeon in their basement
in a few months they are gonna teach us 5 different ways to kidnap someone
I was truly shocked by the duct tape hack
kidnapping life hacks by troom troom but it's how to kidnap better
Just imagine if the hack where she’s left in a room full of guns carried on to say, *shoot the first kidnapper, make sure to find an oil can or small paint can as a silencer, hid the body in the cupboard and put a wooden board on the cupboard so the body won’t tumble out. Sneak out of the room and silently assassinate the second kidnapper and grab the keys left of the door. Escape through the main entrance and avoid the guards.* And then happy music starts playing and it goes back to, Thanks for watching, we hope you enjoyed our tips and tricks! Subscribe for more and like the video!😊  (I also love how when she’s tied up by chains and escapes, but when she gets captured again, the narrator doesn’t say, “Use your strength and peel their arms away” but naw it’s just like straight up kill them by snapping their neck)
Does Danny’s hair look a little different in the ad he did ????
CROSSOVER OF MY FAVORITE CHANNELS POG
Those guys looked way too excited to get that tv
Holy shit, is Danny's hair greying?
10:05 WHY IS HER FACE SO CALM LMAO
So today we all learned that if you are kidnapped by some frugal bandits you can break through the duct tape.
27:25 the kidnapper is just showing Danny how to escape and the kidnapper know his name I’m just thinking if this was a real life situation the kidnapper would totally tell you how to get out and show you the right way lol
Not sure if you have or not but could you talk about all of the devious licks?
I think troom troom is keeping drew hostage
6:10 missed the opportunity to say son of a gun
ok but why are we not talking about the fact danny is using sims 3 music as his background music
kidnap me ❤️
nick: I felt like I was chocking you for a while...  danny: YEAH YOU WERE
HELLO DANNY
no "ft. nickisnotgreen" in the title??
I genuinely LOLed to this video
I have never been this early in my life. Just commenting so I remember when I’m old
arrivederci
Dang that ducktape thing was actually kinda sick
Baddy making weekly uploads? Get it king!
4:00 blame the "kidnapping is funsies!" writing on the YA/NA "dark" romances where the heroine gets bored and pouts and bonds w/her abductors who inevitably think she's amazing.
I love the banter between Nick and Danny. We definitely need more videos with the two of them.
Troom Troom sequaaaaaaalllllll!!!! Woooooo
The scarf part got me💀💀😂
Horses do the trick with holding their breath while getting saddled 😆
😈😻💔gotcha🤪👏girly‼️🙅‍♀️🥸
5:54 feels like an Internet Historian joke.
“I feel like I was choking you for a while, dude” “Yeah you WERE.”
Nobody:  Me, screaming at my tv: "YOU HAVE TO CUT THE TIP"
The narrator's voice is making my ears ring
danny with a scarf
“They’re legally not allowed to chase after you” 😭
Danny I would just like to say I am here early buttt I’m currently watching supernatural so Imma come back in a bit
The first voice annoyed me
i cant get enough of danny and nick content
Hey guys I got real kidnap life hack that could save your life I got this from mr ballen so full credits to him so if your in the trunk break this light thing the cops pull the kidnapers over then you bang at the boot door and hopefully the cops see it
Oh no drew was kidnapped
The chain life hack is actually a real one I’ve seen it a bunch
you can escape being tied up with that hack as long as you arent thick as hell
3:08 WHY DID SHE HAVE TOE SOCKS, PEOPLE OWN THOSE????
All time best click bait i’ve ever seen!!!
Whoa you uploaded again? This is witchcraft
I’m sort of disappointed that one of the hacks isn’t “put leaves in your hair to turn you into Billie Eilish so the kidnappers get confused and you can run away”
I can't with THE SIMS MUSIC in the background
That laugh at 22:12 might one of my favorite Danny moments ever
A thing that I noticed: Imagine if troom troom is recording these videos of kidnapping and the cops come for them. I wonder what they would tell them:   *"Oh, we're just recording some videos to teach people how to react when they are kidnapped"*   What if the cops ask them for their channel and they find out this-
Literally life hacks that might save your life           Not
I've missed these videos
The dramatic music whenever he tried a hack had me rolling
I'm glad Danny tried the duck tape. I've seen legitimate channels explain that same method for getting out of such tape
Danny teaching kidnappers how many layers of duct tape they need to successfully bind a captive
Hiii, early squad😎
Dan Dan the mermaid man
The Dislikes are from the Kidnappers…
And that is how Danny perished
Life hack: kidnapp your friends under the guise of a wacky YouTube video.
Takes notes “buy them tv, they no kidnap you”
Hehehehrha
FINALLY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
I’m feeling Gregory today
Now Danny you said you’d be concerned if someone had a dungeon…. Why does it look like you have one? 🤨🤔
9:15 either troom troom learning Italian, or troom troom is watching JoJo part 5
The narrator sounds like they're trying and failing to do a Mickey Mouse impression
nick, fighting back tears :  "why is the mouth hole so big???"
I just had surgery and it hurts to laugh….gots to see it through tho
" i felt like i was choking u for a while there" "yeah you were"
“I hear Stockholm is very nice this time of the year” -micheal
wow this will definitely help me when i get kidnaps OH CRAP
You can't convince me troom Troom videos aren't the narrator's villian origin story.... slowly losing her mind through one ridiculous tutorial after another...
“Are you guys about to set off fireworks!?”  God, I hate when people can’t mind their own business. 🙄
How to escape from dungeon  Step 1. Become Monke   ...   alright thanks for listening to my ted talk
Oh shit here in the first 12mins
Most true fact Danny has ever said," Guys guns don't kill people, criminals kill people"
Donda Danny
arrivedurci losers
"I love when he wears that scarf" *cue romantic black and white slo-mo shot* "what an amazing party it was..." *cue black and white choking sequence*
Get kidnapped
[popular comment]
"Thats genius Kevin!" also Kevin: *Gives matches to the victim*
Danny Collabing with Nickisnotgreen 🤯 Damn  ! So happy for Danny.
Danny this is my favorite video you have made ever ( I pressed the notification button and now I am at my final form, GREG)
I thought I was watching a Kurtis Connor video 🤨
I love how self-aware troom troom is. It’s energetic content for the kids and mindless meme content for the adults.
Why Danny's friend looks 14 too?
ur face whegn u were breathng in the  chair plseeaes
Amazing as always 💞   Tysm for making my day amazing ✨
Why do they think that this is relatable to the general population?
3:34 First of all, that's clearly her hand. Second, I do NOT like how they dressed her up like a little kid, that feels really creepy. Especially since they have one of the kidnappers "fall in love" with her, and there's the picture of her eating a banana... 😬
Remember kids always tip your kidnappers after you escape for their efforts 🤗
This narrator makes me want to die
Make sure to be a polite victim! You can't leave your kidnappers without leaving them a gift! They did put a lot of effort into kidnapping YOU.
I was watching this on nicks stream and he kept pausing and it was annoying so now I'm here, sorry nick plus don't hate me
Thought this was tips to help you kidnap people
Hello greg
does anyone think about getting kidnaped and the hacks actually work
This was posted on my 13th birthday
Danny not knowing how to light a lighter for 5 minutes
ITS A MIRACLE
"Are you tied up with scotch tape!?"      *PERFECT* !
Stockholm syndrome sets in really fast I guess
I’m sorry-
I'm guessing the writer's favorite song is boy is a gun
im sorry what         ...
Doesn’t the girl look like she is a 6 year old girl and just came out of the carnival
Troom troom really made a jojo reference then continue to tell you to kill your captors by snapping their neck
"Guns don't kill people, Criminals do." Danny Gonzalez pro gun confirmed.
Imagine your kidnapped and scared, but luckily you still have a device that the robbers didn't see. Then you decide to open YouTube to find a Troom Troom video on kidnapping...
First
Does Danny not realize he can just raise his chest and not hold his breath
Ive been waiting for this kind of video
Hi bestie
"how much effort would you have to put into throwing it back to crush someone?"  -Drew Gonzalez, 2021
10 /10 ma man
15:32 That's how Indians wear a "scarf" (it's usually made with cotton or something like that tho and not wool and it's called a _dupatta_ but close enough)
these hacks worked almost too well. i have no idea where i am! 😀👍 thanks troom troom
The duct tape one does work, u can actually break free if u do it correctly
i was just watching his old troom troom vids and then this popped up
danny teaching nick how to kidnap based off troom troom's hacks will never not be funny to me
Getting kidnapped is so beta Danny :/
The only way the troom troom video would be good is if they said "Now what you're gonna wanna do" in J.J Bitenbinder's voice
I'm being kidnapped right now. Thanks for the only video im able to watch, Danny!
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT??? WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST SEE??? 3:07 SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED
man i showed up 25 minutes after Danny posted and so many people have already seen this vid.... use me as a 'I'll never be first comment' button 😭
*steps of melting ur zip tie handcuffs:* 1. have long leg 2. toe sock
this is so scary i really thought danny was getting kidnapped !
How come Troom Troom has so many videos on how to escape kidnappings but none on how to successfully pull one off? Whose looking out for those crafty kidnappers?
by personal experiences yes this is actually quite common
Is it only me or the whole video is just a black screen
Danny I've noticed your unibrow, there's no escaping now.
this isn’t a commentary video, this is a survivor documentary.
omfg the strangling lifehack has me fucking dying
They actually put a lot of whork in kidnapping you
This is the best thing I'm gonna see all day
Hi yah I’m free hahaha
At 7:51 I first thought the license plate said "troom troom- make trash". Now that would be the perfect slogan...
0:03 yes I am
10:17 'how much force I'd have to put into throwing it back to crush someone' sounds like a line from a twerk self defence class
Greg = Pog     -Albert Einstein or someone idk
when the victim pushes her back her seat in the car the her facial expressions and kidnapper juss delete
soo did u invite the guy?
First thing troom troom says: “are you being strangled?” oml
"I'm being kidnapped 😃"
I dont know why, but when I read the title I thought I was about to get some pointers on how to kidnap people.
ok but wtf happened to the narrators voice
Haha isn't kidnapping cool? We should totally shower them with gifts. And this is verified by TroomTroom, a totally legit company that absolutely isn't involved in human trafficking.
WHY IS SHE TALKING LIKE THAT- She sounds like me when I’m trying to make my mom not get mad at me after seeing my report card
danny are you okay blink twice if you need help
It’s funny because nobody has finished the video yet.
Kidnapping and playing with matches... i wonder if youtube will consider troom troom's video suitable for children  yeah probably
as a kidnapper i can confirm these hacks are really ineffective
25 mins ago
You’re doing much better than Drew rn good job
7:22 I guess she developed Stockholm syndrome
Omg
Danny  where you in boy scouts?
The fact that she just took a picture of the "trap" instead of going into it is the most realistic thing I've ever seen from a troom troom video.
I don’t know why but Nick almost killing Danny by choking him really got me 😂😂😂
Drew should really stop getting into trouble, he knows that thr robot birds are spying on us for the lizard people 😔
This voice person is how half the youtube tutorials I watch at 3am sound like to me. But like what even are these audio clips? Especially at 8:56 , as the dude just gives the chain a good sniff
Who's gonna tell him those aren't strike anywhere matches?
:D
Hi
Early!also love your videos danny
Me reading the title: Wait Troom Troom is teaching you how to kidnap people now?
that wink.. did my heart just flutter for danny 21:48
ariva derchie losers
i thought everyone knew the breathe-out trick and the duck tape thing??? at least i read about them in a book when i was 10, so i thought it was a common thing lmao. then again the character was obsessed with apocalypse survival tricks so...they also had a thing where when you get your ankles tied, if you're wearing shoes, take them off, then try to slip it off
That duct tape hack is pretty cool
12:25 donda donda dondaaaaa dondadondadonda doooooooooondaaaaaa donda donda
“arrivederci losers”  oh no… you’ve summoned them…     the jojo fandom.
not again
Troom troom is kidnapped and is trying to lie so they can get free
What’s with the sims 3 music in the background 😶‍🌫️
No way they aren’t just doing this for attention
13:33 reminds me of granolaaaaa granolaa in my throat
Pure chaos.
did u get a spray tan
The narrator's voice in Troom Troom is even more annoying this time around. Either the lady inhaled 3 gallons of helium before recording, or a guy got kicked so hard his balls went up into his navel.
Why does the narrirator sound like female mickey mouse?
damn danny ur hair is looking freaking good in this video my man what a handsome baby boy
I love how the girl in the first sketch just takes off the handcuffs and opens the cell door as if there’s not gonna be a lock in a real kidnapping
Oh TroomTroom
I love this crossover.  moreover I discovered Nick’s channel recently
Still waiting for the “how to kidnap little boys in Jean shorts” tutorial
I read that title and thought troom troom was giving hacks on HOW to kidnap. And I thought Danny was testing out kidnapping hacks. By kidnapping. Honestly sounds like something that would be in a troom troom video. Hehe
Never clicked a video so fast 🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️
post notifs on i am now greg
imagine getting kidnapped and you search for youtube videos to try to escape, you click one and all you hear is “Writings not easy. That’s why grammarly can help. This sentence is grammatically corre-“
i can’t omg nicks arm at 0.07 🤭🤭
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
Road to 5 Mil
I feel like any second YouTube is gonna read the title wrong and take down this video.
Let’s gooo I love this series
hey drew, nice video
9:17 that is NOT ANY WAY TO BREAK A CHOKE HOLD! And I say that as someone who practices breaking various chokes 3x a week. Look up krav maga choke breaks, they're simple and use physics (hands and thumbs are delicate, don't let them close your airway) so anyone of any size can do it properly. Troom troom's "tip" only works in movies or for navy seals
Early Gang
hehe haha
🎶🎵Danny, i’m in luv with a criminal🎵🎶
the 12-15 min area when ur making ur mask and toe socks got me laughing and smiling while making slime PLS
as opposed to awesome kidnapping life hacks?
*nick, fighting back tears* : "why is the mouth hole so big???"
SO MANY CRIMANALS IN THIS ROOM
NEW CORNER ALERT!!!!
troom troom gonna kill us all
8:30 if your kidnappers leave you in the trunk for 15 minutes, you're legally allowed to flee and they can't chase you.
This is amazing. Troom troom is insane
These Lifehacks are so good.
15:15 Sounds like a forgetful rabbi
of course nick is the one kidnapping danny after all their baddie SMP beef
Thank you
hi daddy 😩
"ArE yOu GeTtInG sTrAnGlEd?"
21:48 THE WINK AHHH
next troom troom video, "15 LIVESAVING HACKS FOR GETTING SEXUALLY ASSUALTED"
I’m early for onceee
why does the troom troom girl sound like a shitty minnie mouse impression
EARLY CREW love the vids Danny keep going and keep up the great work😁
4:41   Why did I think troom troom was about to get really rated R and take things to a whole new level
Finally I can now break out of Danny Gonzalez’s basement
... Is that Sims 3 Build Buy music in the background during the beginning...
Yeah, I don’t know how much I wanna trust troom troom with my life
This went from sending a TV to a couple of kidnappers to a neck-snapping tutorial too fast
Danny i was cranking 90’s in fortnite and you posted this why do you do this?
6:24 Walked right past the kidnappers, thanks Troom Troom!
I like to think that Troom Troom is now just being a parody of what it once was and that they are having fun with it
You remind me of Danny Gonzalez
This video will help me later.
YO THIS IA SO USEFUL, I GOT KIDNAPPED AND I ESCAPED WITH THESE HACKS
Why did i think they made a vid on how to kidnap people instead of how to get out of getting kidnapped
The title made it seem like it’s teaching you how to kidnap lmaoo
thumbnail so good its now my laptop wallpaper
2:00. 2:48.  5:06
Lifehack: if you're kindapped, escape and buy the kidnappers a brand new tv. It sure is gonna discourage them from doing it again. Totally.
Gre
Danny that scarf actually look hella good on you in the crafting corner
No hot glue I'm unsubscribing
Plot twist the kidnappers were family
That voice got so much worse Holy cow please no.
That neck snap got me dying ☠️☠️☠️
This is why I follow Danny. He gets kidnapped so I don't have to
The ten dislikes are kidnappers who lost potential victims.
The narrator is so annoying
Spit on me Danny.
Where did the hair cloud go? 🦹‍♂️
The hack for getting out of chains is from the Hardy Boys nice try troom troom
i was gonna sleep since its 23:30 but god damn daniel u making me question myself
Hiya
Praise lord Kevin
"Are you getting strangled?"
Danny, imma keep commenting until you do it. PLEASE make a video about Rat Movie: Mystery of the Mayan Treasure. thank you.
its so sweet that such a huge youtuber like nick would show up in your video 💜
Dam
K I L L Y O U R K I D N A P P E R S, k i l l t h e m.  burst out laughing
Hii Danny! Finally an upload :))
"So I looked everywhere but nowhere had toe socks" Yeah sorry Danny those left in 2016 XD
The crafting corner isn't in a corner
This is for Nick, here is when you appear: 15:53
I can't wait to get kidnapped to try out these goofy life hacks! 😊
Wow I was fast
Phew.. thank God for toe socks
If the kidnappers don't came back in 15 minutes you're legally allowed to leave
As a professional kidnapper, I see no flaws
Oh shit this is brand new
E
I like how he specified that he wouldn’t get his feet out **for free*
troom troom be like “how to survive a traumatic event🤪✌️”
0:41 *Mickey's life took a dark turn after Minnie left him*
"Gimme yourself!" LMAO
Why does the "It's ducktape" send me 🤣
Wow im so early its already 3 but im too hyped haha
Yes! I love these videos!
Epic video
"i did it perfectly wrong, it seems" 💀 lol
Nick has to be the coolest kidnapper I’ve ever seen
Thanks this helped me so much
I didn’t expect people to kidnap me the same way that Elmer Fudd hunts wabbits, but here we are I guess
Bam
Hello fellow Gregs
NICKKKK
that sims music in the backround is great
Hot glue would have been better than fabric glue almost certainly
The narrator's voice is the most annoying thing, it's like she's always speaking in falsetto
Well I'm guessing if they watch troom troom and take troom troom seriously they probably do play with matches 🤣
God i thought that it would be on how to kidnap not how to excape waste of time
Trying Troom Trooms WHAT?
Ah yes…. The good old let me do something stupid from troom troom  Just what Greg wants
OUR BOY NICK
What in Sims3 CAS music--
Okay someone clip Danny saying "I'm trynna get dominated" and "I just need a friend to tie me up" and put them together
the unexpected use of sims 3 music as bgm in the beginning awoke such a deep sense of nostalgia in me
If you chase your kidnapping-victim you *will* be slapped by legal... 😤
10:00  Did yall see just see that stun, I think she got a crititcal on him for that extra dps that's a true combo right there
troom troom is always there to make me feel a bit smarter than I actually am
Matches that easily ignite from ANY friction aren't save, thus would not be used these days. We have *Saftey* matches.
Why is the crafting corner so crooked??
is that fucking sims background music
I can just imagine a person saying to a judge "I'm not the criminal, that gun is!  It told me to pull the trigger and his friends the bullets flew out of him at insane speeds."
nickisnotkidnapper
Bro I couldn't sit through all of this because the troom troom voiceover makes me want to gouge my eyes out
Hiiii sister
Lmao, so helpful!
“Blankets are the best disguise” -Konohamaru
i think danny should react to squid game it would be hilarious
I can’t tell if the narrator sounds more like mickey mouse or snow whilte
13:02 "I did it perfectly wrong" Task failed sucsessfully
Dang 15 minutes ago.
This is the earliest i've been to a daddy gonzalez video. NEAT
13:00 OMG DANNY I'M CALLING THE COPS YOU'RE A SPOOPY KIDNAPPER
I love that I was literally on my way to comment about how difficult it'd be to randomly tear off your scarf, only for them to hit me with the velcro DIY
The narrator voice sounds like she's being forced to sometimes
I have a mid term hours from Now and I was about to cry but Danny posted so I will postpone my break down for this 💖
I got the notification 15 minutes late and Im gonna kidnap youtube using troom troom's tips
Um. Why did the bandit have to smell the chains at 8:37?
The Greg ambassador himself
Plot twist: Troom Troom kidnaps Danny after this to see if he can escape using their hacks
Dang this video has 37k views In 20 minutes?
hmmmm
I AM GREG, I liked and subbed today
"hacks that MAY save your life" with may being "hey if you try this and it fails, that ain't on us" 😭
Dam 7 minutes ago?
Hey, if you're getting kidnapped, either ask hen for help or confess your love for Danny. Works 100%
Pog
Thought this was gonna be a video of Danny trying to kidnap people for a second.
"Turns out that even as babies, they were still... guns"
Hell yea broothers I’m GeG now
The troom troom vid reminds me of the meme that says, "If you're getting robbed, just say no. They legally can't rob you."
Imagine you kidnap someone, and you go to check in on them and they're watching fucking troom troom videos on how to escape
31 min video niceee
Ninja's cant catch you when you're on fire.
You're a cool dude
The Joker wishes he could come across as unhinged as a Troom Troom video
thank you danny, this video helped me escape my kidnappers and their criminals, I can’t thank you enough
Man he is cranking these out FAST
I’ve been waiting ages for this thank you so much for uploading your the best
Here
i like how danny doesn't even realize the narrator is different or maybe it's just me.. to me, she just sounds different.. Edit: I just realized the voice changed back..
Is no one else going to comment on how the narrator's voice was apparently grown in a lab to be as goddamn annoying as possible? Because holy shit! Even putting aside the incredibly stupid, dangerous, insulting, and even potentially traumatizing content of these videos, her voice alone makes me want to puncture my eardrums. At least that way the pain would be self-inflicted
i’m so glad a big youtuber like nick came to help out this small youtuber’s channel!! he’s so nice
Thanks this helped
getting the kidnappers a brand new TV sounds like what Mr Beast would do if he ever got kidnapped
TWO OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THIS YAYYYYY
9:43 usually.
troom troom's like 5 minute crafts but on crack
Can we just appreciate how the only sounds the people make are grunts, screams and random noises
I mean the channel is based in Ukraine or Belarus. So if they say anything against the president of Belarus, they probably get kidnapped and dissapear, so kinda a problem they might face.
No way this is monetized lol
early
Danny where is spooky song plz
Ayo cough reveal
14 MINUTES AGO WTF
Funniest parts of the video
No umm.. but yess please
Wiki feet 😭
"I'm being kidnapped! :D" LMAO
troom troom: “if ur kidnapped, just escape! and then give them a reward for kidnapping you!!”
I’m surprised Danny isn’t dead 💀
Oh no I'm trapped under a cardboard box with nothing but matches and toe socks help.
“She snapped his neck, does that Kill people?”  Amazing commentary Danny!
Danny where is spooky song plz
That John Mulaney sketch street smarts has better advice than this……
Tell me why I was just thinking of his troom troom videos looked him up and this was posted 13 mins ago😂
Danny where is spooky song plz
I saw Danny has a new roasting Troom Troom video and my day was immediately made
Notice how they say “may” save your life.
Only 13 minutes late
Danny why didn’t you use the “ski mask” you had in your I’m gonna I’ll Santa clause video?? 😂
couldn’t you have just reused the mask you made for when you killed santa claus?
gotcha girly 🥰✌️
is she a moose?!??!!?
The fact kidnapping lifehacks exist make me want to kidnap someonr, make them watch those videos and prove they don't work. (for legal reasons this is a joke)
Im pretty sure the narrator is washed up child star Alvin chipmunk pretending to be a girl
“Hey I’m kidnapped, lemme look up this video to help me on my phone and not call the police”
gimme your…self !!
6:49 that is kung lao not raiden lmaooo troom troom, get your stuff right please.
“what’s happening?? she’s supposed to be scared!”  idk about y’all, but a cardboard box propped up with a stick is actually so terrifying 🤧
"Is the narrator on the kidnappers side?!"- Danny Gonzalez, 2021
Damn no notifications and still here 13 minutes after posted 🥰
Narrator giving huge Luna Lovegood vibes
So early that the comment sections isn't even fun :(
Real advice, go for sensitive spots like under the bicep. high pain low damage.
i like girls
Wtf was on that girls face? Was it from a previous makeup life hack using fruity pebbles?😂
Lol even more bad life hacks
✨are you getting strangled?✨
I have subbed  I AM TRULY GREG!!!!!!
Ah yes when I'm kidnapped I'm just looking at troom troom instead of calling the police.
I'm sorry but is the narrators throat ok? That voice has to be forced and it must hurt
i would never kidnap Danny. he’s too stinky
9:54 wassup fuckers
thank you for posting on my birthday danny.
If you don’t wanna get kidnapped, just don’t. What are they gonna do? Kidnap u? U already said you didn’t want to.
12 minutes is the fastest I’ve been to one of your videos lmfao
bro its been 12 minutes and theres already over 30,000 views
as opposed to troom troom’s great kidnapping hacks
The narrators voice: 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟
y’all sleepin on troom trooms acting abilities
9:30 lol
Are you getting strangled 😊
Oh my goodness thank you Danny you’re a life saver... well not really, considering I’m now going to go successfully kidnap strangers!
The narrator was on mouse mode
These never get old great job 👍
Uhh the title is  a bit misleading
YES
omg here in 12 mins i’m so good
I was kidnapped oh no, troom troom help me
"guns don't kill people, criminals kill people" -Danny Gonzalez 2021
Only 3 seconds in and I know this is going to be amazing 😂
e
HA
As long as troom troom  keeps doing stuff like this, Danny will never run out of content
Uploaded 12 minutes ago and 32k views already, zooweemomma
No disrespect to anyone but Danny’s looking so good in this video 🤧
When the cops find this in ur history: Ummmm… I was watching for a friend?…
12minuets shawtys
Can't wait for the kidnapping theme to catch on, next video is 15 DIFFERENT WAYS TO HAVE FUN WHILE YOUR KIDNAPPER DEVELOPS STOCKHOLM SYNDROME!!
Its funny coz it happens to the best of us...
Just started the video and I love it already
Why does the narrator sound like she’s trying to talk like Snow White
not the sims 3 build mode music in the background.....
hi
I don’t like the shirt that Danny is wearing.
t o e  s o c k s ?
Yaaaay!!!! This upload made my entire day! 💖
Hehe I have arrived 😈
Yo
“Are you getting strangled⁉️ 🤩” Danny: *ÆÃËGH—*
Damn this is SERIOUSLY intense.
Sims 3 music 👀
I’m freaking laughing when you said kill your captors if you anyway
Thx Daddy
1.9k comments in 11 minutes 😳😳
I have notifications on. I am truly Greg.
The narrator sounds kinda like the mom from Ryan’s World 🤔
Boop
why does the narrator have the most consistently inconsistent voice ever
*looks at the title* Finally, some hack how to kidnap Danny.
The "AAH he's back" caught me off guard
"give TVs to your kidnappers!" Huh
Here within 10 minutes
are we just gonna ignore the first girl taking selfie’s with a box that looks like a trap...
Early gang 👇
This will be so useful for the next time I get kidnapped
When I'm kidnapped I'll make sure to be covered in baby oil so i should always just be covered in baby oil 24/7
Hi
are you getting strangled? 🤔  well if you dont remember OUR hack you'll die! <3 :D
1:29 This voice is horrendous my god  Also "Gotcha girlie !! :D" Why does she sound so happy reading that line ajsgbjbsgs
TROOM TROOM IS BACK NOW!
Danny Gonzalez upload?????????
How in the world you just rip a scraf like that?😶
Early :)
I never imagined the troom troom voice over could possibly get worse
Ok is no one gonna talk about those toe socks like what
I would want Troom Troom’s narrator to narrate everything wrong in my life
“if you’re kidnapped in a car, just get out”  if you’re homeless just buy a house
First comment!
*Report for false information*
Did troom troom get a new narrator?
So that box trap at the beginning just completely baffles me because I don't understand it. Did they expect her to actually fall for it? There's not even any bait. Was it meant to be a distraction so they could surprise attack her? Then why were they disappointed when it didn't work? This is atrocious and Troom Troom is a scourge on this planet.
i just wonder how they got the rights to use mickey mouse’s voice for these videos
why does emily stand there after presumably snapping their kidnappers neck? you should run away not just stare at them????
Yay vid
I am truly Greg
dany gozalez
The kick napper iss a simp
Almost to 5mil Danny
This whole video is just troom troom being desperate
Present!!!
Are they sponsored by Playstation in that video about the tv
Damn now I can’t kidnap you without you escaping
Ah yes Before i get killed by my kidnapper I set myself on fire  get fuxked kidnappers
WHAT. AM. I. WATCHING. 😳🤯
truly greg... no one likes craig anyway
Are you ok Danny?
ive been waiting for another danny and nick collab since the fragnance video
The hacks are so awful I would know from experience 🚐
Ello
I'm crying at how funny these are.
Kidnapping hacks. Look at us! What a time to be alive!
Are you being strangled? Well then watch this 10 minute video before you die!
sia be taking notes
Troom troom and the Eric Andre show are human contributions to inter dimensional cable
wow 8 mins ago and ALREADY 5.8K likes u go Danny
danny, can you let me out of your basement. im hungry.
danny r u ok
Hmmm troom troom
Hey Danny, you look nice today
Being early to one of Danny's videos is the best feeling
Why does this plot seem like a fanfic
3:08 why do the socks have toes? WHY DO THE SOCKS HAVE TOES?!
I’m a pro at this
Danny is rocking that scarf like a king
God I hate this woman’s voice
Drew, why are you posting on this weird channel?
The cinematography at the beginning
there's no reason I should be this early
LETS GOOOO LESS THAN ONE HOUR GANG WYA
im sorry WHAT 😀
why is the narrator so positive and everything about kidnapping, kinda psycho
so this is what the road work ahead guy has been up to
oooo looks "entertaining"
hello daniel
Bruh Chain
But if the cage was unlocked, she didn’t even need to melt the zip tie tho 🤔
Im here before the 10 min marc!!!
the narrator sounds high
*Reading title* What the FUCK Danny
“Hey if you kidnapped in a car…. Just get out of the car” 🤠
gamer
Most of the time the first person is smiling  She was getting yelled at and she just smiled  Seeing a box trap, she smiled Escaping the dungeon and she still gave them a tv
um
Wth are these socks 3:31
danny AND benoftheweek posting in the same hour?! this must be paradise
someone help Drew he’s in danger!
Finally something that will do my day better
Uwu

Jesus Christ I saw that I got here at 15 seconds after posting watched a little then checked comments and Theres like hundreds lmao
YOOOO
STREET SMARTS
3 views?
Wowsa im early. Time to get kidnapped and... set myself on fire?
this reminds me of the worst burglars ever like the guy who put a maxi pad over his eyes then he couldn’t see so lol
sus
Is that the fucking bubble wand song from bella sara? I didn't know I remembered that song!
oh
ill need this advice
I can’t be the only one who thought this was about hacks to help you kidnap someone
i enjoy  having notifications on for danny's twitter posts
What happened to the narrators voice in the beginning!?! Did they fire the old girl and hire princess peach instead!?
Early gang
Can this day even get better? Just had a AMIZING day out with my freinds  And now you uplode a troom troom video 😂
Danny is this a cry for help
these videos from Danny get progressively more and more chaotic and i’m all for it to be honest
Here before 1h
oh no my hands have been tied! but thankfully i carry matches so i can melt my zip ties away and escape! thanks troom troom, you're a life saver
I love your videos, *Drew Gorgonzola*
3:15  ☝️☝️☝️😗 you sit still
Claim your "here before 10mins" ticket here👏👍
I saw kidnapping hacks and have never clicked on a video so fast
I just love sitting down to have breakfast while watching the newest video from Daniel Gorgonzola. Thank you.
why does the narrator’s voice sound so broken jeeshsus
why does the narrator give me dora the explorer vibes
Why's there no audio
Yo ur easily one of the most funniest people I’ve ever came across tbh, i always laugh
show us how to kidnap next
another great video drew 👍🏻
weewoo cool video! missed the troom troom vids :D
imagine getting kidnapped and you hear “Gotcha, girlie!”
🤭 Who else is hiding in the comments??
Oh my god Danny, please don't die
Did troom troom replace the old narrator
Heyyyy Danny picked the thumbnail I liked
Lets go Brandon
am i tripping or is that Sims 3 music in the beginning of this video omg
What to do if Stan and Mitch from Road 96 kidnap you
So happy he's posting every week again! I was so afraid he was going to end up with the odd1sout syndrome and start posting once every 6 months since he's so successful now
dannygonzalez moment
POV: If Greg kidnaps Danny
fun fact: it's literally impossible for you to have finished this video yet
“Are you getting strangled?”
ello
Troomtroom went from bad to worse it’s not even fun anymore.
Danny I liked the video but  I don’t know about the part when you kidnapped 3 children and held them for Randsom for 35 hours until the SWAT raided your bunker and you got into a shootout before escaping on your trusty jet pack. Good video tho, love you Drew ❤️
Wow
Why did I think this was going to be how TO kidnap
thumbnail assures me this is gonna be a ride
Hello
im early Pog
Producer: "So how many cringe ideas with unhelpful/ tedious tricks that will most likely get someone killed do you wanna make?"  Troom Troom: "Yes"
nice
I will suck seed
The 5 dislikes disgust me.
new greg video
ive never in the "beta busts a fat nut" minute range of earliness. 3 minutes squad rise up
AAA 5 MINS AGO, THIS IS THE FIRST VID IM SEEING COME OUT AFTER I BINGED/STARTED WATCHING U
drew what are you doing
Here within an hour!
troom troom is so dangerous like these videos are made for KIDS
Danny, I know you wanna prove Troom Troom wrong, but kidnapping’s going a little bit too far man.
SUS
The narrator's voice is in my worst nightmares, just narrating everything with their high pitched voice
A fate worse than death, getting kidnapped, then seeing the troom troom intro.
ugh I hate it when the dungeon has no wifi soo boring 😒/j
1604th comment
“I’m being kidnapped!😃”
here at 18k!
is nobody going to mention how it looks like she has fruity pebble cereal stuck to her face?
awful review drew, you didnt even kidnap anyone 0/10
Can confirm the box trick really works, to bad none of the people in my basement have access to Troom Troom
Can't believe I made it here within 6 minutes lmao
My boyyyyy!
rn, there should be no one that has finished this video
IM EARLY
great video, danny. 👍
I feel like nobody's talking about how the narrator's voice somehow got several hundred octaves higher.
im grinning so hard with the joy i feel for this video coming out right now
26:28 lol
3:08 WHAT ARE THOSE SOCKS, WHY DO THEY HAVE TOE POCKETS. FEET GLOVES WTF
The saga continues.
This is such a crackhead energy video
Wait a minute this isn’t the Ferris Bueller’s Day Off CD I ordered
Jesus ive never heard a more annoying voice
"are you getting strangled?" "No"
Ah yes, another Danny Burrito video.
Can’t wait to use this at the local elementary school!
4 minutes and already 1.3 thousand comments
HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY DANNY
i have never been this early for a video before
The narrators voice is already making me wanna cut off my ears
Imagine using a fucking Troom Troom hack to get out of a life or death situation 💀    *Survival 1000*
UGH! A dungeon again? Come on Martin, AT LEAST give her some legos.
Troop troom is dumb but I think we all know that, hell, they probably know it too
Danny looks like he needs help
Please kidnap me, Danny
He returns to the demon again
I thought this meant life hacks for kidnapping, I'm slightly disappointed
Kidnappings in cartoons be like!!!
Danny would never get kidnapped. He's a sigma male.
heLLO
I hate the narrator’s voice
Yeeat
*I can use this knowledge* - Lots of love from me and Wario
The 6 dislikes are troom troom and 123 go’s channels
HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY
omg is that james potter
I feel like the average troom troom viewer is way too young to apply these things in an actual kidnapping situation, even if it was useful
Troop troom is dumb but I think we all know that, hell, they probably know it too
Calling it right now—the narrator was kidnapped by Troom Troom, and she’s exposing her escape plan. Either that or this is a cry for help.
Subbed and notified I am truly greg
It seems troomtroom thinks that every kidnapper is Bowser and every kidnapee is Peach.
danny this might be a little TOO goofy and TOO silly for your first channel,,,
oh god are you okay danny..
I hate it when Danny gets kidnapped by Danny.
can u tie me up like this danny
LIFE HACK: If you ever find yourself getting kidnapped by a gang of Mexican bandits, tell them that what they are doing is illegal. Kidnapping is illegal in most countries, and they will immediately stop what they are doing and let you go. Try it!
Hahaha
I'm early whoa
Hey did anyone else get a right wing ad at the begining for some sort of republican news site? What the hell? The Epoch Times or some shit
Love the Chicago sweater!
I didn't even know toe socks were a thing before this video
Kidnapping??         Ttoom troom is running out of ideas
No one: Troom Troom: "Are you getting strangled?"
0:05 Why TF did my dirty brain think of something else?
came for danny, stayed for nick
hi denny
Well, Troom Troom has once again rendered me absolutely speechless….. Thank you for the video anyway, Danny!
The reason why troom troom even knows how to survive from kidnaps is it probably happens to them way to often
pop off danny!
The only reason I like troom troom at this point is because it forces Danny to make these vids lmaooo
I miss the old troom troom narrator, what happened to her?
Damn I’m early
Epic napping
1,439th
The Sims 3 music that Danny's using it bringing me back 😭
that new haircut fire tho
Nice
3:08 just a random and unintentional timestamp for me to replay, keep scrolling
The socks…please omg wtf💀
So when does Danny reveal he’s collabing with Troom Troom?
How to escape a kidnapper: use your hot glue gun, since I always have my glue gun on me.
The bunny holepunch 😳
First 5 minutes gang!
Yo, can't believe Nick of "Nickisnotgreen" fame actually kidnapped THE "Danny Gonzalez"
i saw the title and i thought it was gonna be a very different post
Danny is actually dead this is his cousin dorby goragzalex
the first vids from u i saw were the troom troom vids omg😭
Look up the song Guilty if your struggling
what up, watching on nick’s stream first. hi besties.
pemis
here within 5 minutes
why does the voice over sound so done with it sometimes lmao "gOtCha GiRlY"
Yay another Troom troom vid. I missed these. they're so funny 😂
Do kidnappers just zip tie your hands and leave you with matches 😃
Idk how to respond to being early
Troom Troom. Maybe posting a video about "kidnapping pranks" isn't the best idea
*it’s called we do a litte trolling*
bruh whatsup with the narrator's😭😭
Holy shit the background music in the begging is from sims 3 lmao I'm having so many flashbacks :)
Best kidnapping trick? _Just don't get kidnapped!_
Here within five minutes trophies sold here: 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
heya!
“I’m being kidnapped”
Earliest I've ever been lmaoo
the legacy continues
troom troom is trolling the fuck outta you Danny  they want their fave to make more content, I guess
“if u have a box of matches, u can think of so many games” *arson*
I      I \ O / - Huh-ho Huh-ho    I   /\  I   I
Can't wait to be kidnapped sometime soon so I can find use of these hacks
Never been so early to such a mess of a video
I love getting kidnapped! It’s such a thrilling and hopeful experience!
Finally a sponsor for la croix
i can’t wait for this video oh boy
Troom broom
First
Never been this early for a video. Crazy. Also, why does the narrator sound like Mickey Mouse?
Drew might need these after he arrives in Coastal Rica.
1:03 🪤
hi guys
over 1k comments in 3 minutes, how desperate are yall for clout
Troom Troom will always find a way to impress in the worst ways possible.
I think Danny’s hair is finally at peace
"gotcha girly" be something i'm gonna say a lot often because of this
5 minute gang
"GrEaT jOb MaRtIn" 😀
messi or ronaldo?

Troom Troom in your room room  Lead you to your doom doom
I’m getting strangled
Another troomtroom video? Hell yes dandan
A true Sigma like Danny would never get kidnapped in the first place.
Yay new video I've been waiting lol
I bought a rhino shield a while ago they are truly great cases
Oh god the narrators voice oh no 💀
Lol
Claim your first 40 minutes ticket🎟
Why does the troom troom narrator sound like she’s being forced to speak while being held at gunpoint
Earliest ive ever been
Oh this is great! I was looking for something like this
Hello there!
Bro Danny is a pro kidnappee
Now I know I can kidnap you and you can't escape

ITS NICK TIME
I see Danny, I click and like.  I see Nick, I like three more times.
Danny gorbzalez 😳👌🏾
Not the toe socks 😂
I can’t stand thinking I’m early to a Popular YouTubers video cause there’s always more than like 10 k views so I’ll never be early 🤨😕🤪
joe mama

The dungeon is so aesthetic 🙄 wtf is she on😕

It's troom troom
danny I will kidnap you by using troom troom hack yes i know
🤨
I literally just commented so I can see the comments turn to 666
“Thats GENIUS Kevin!”  …ma’am its a box.
What was the point of the box if you were just gonna choke her
"What's up Greg" That is always the best to hear! Greg is a Troom Troom/Useless life hacks critic indeed.
Literally Detroit
Yay now i know how to kidnap people, thanks danny.
Ahhh yes the classic everyday kidnapping
*when you get kidnapped but don’t watch Troom Troom*
He said us
Hello
Studying all day long and then watching a danny video in bed is the best feeling known to men
I forgot troom troom was a thing 🤣
The video's been out for 2 minutes, and it already has a thousand comments. These are some quick Gregs
Thanks, I've been waiting on these hacks for a while
I left a Nickisnotgreen video for a Danny Gonzales Video with Nick
“kidnapping hacks”… the way I cackled when I read this oh my goodness. Ur so fucking funny Danny you’re videos make my day. :)
I feel like I’m going months on months without your next video when in reality I have a poor sense of time
.
Chungus
Why does the narrator sound like she’s trying to talk like Snow White
I was just thinking that I wanted a new danny upload like 10 minutes ago

Turned on notifications and subscribed!
I just find it hilarious having the girl casually say “I’m getting kidnapped” then the title showing

At first I thought Troom Troom was making Kidnapping hack videos to make Kidnapping people easier but sadly it’s the opposite.
I'm being kidnapped
Imagine if yoir doing military training and this video is the one that teaches you how to not get kidnapped
Everyone who reads this, have a great day! And don’t get kidnapped😃  Also, what do u guys think of my pfp, I drew it today and I really like it.
E
why does the narrators voice sound so off
You know it a good video when it starts with "Are you getting strangled?"
"Ah! I'm being kidnapped! Omg they left my phone with me! Let me watch troom troom instead of calling the cops!"

Danny: Wait, I’m sorry… Is the narrator on the kidnappers side? Troom troom: Yes, Yes she is
Danny

I just notice that troom troom changed like the narrator, the actors wonder what happend to them old ones
The new voice is anoying🙄
I was feeling like shit.. and I needed it
Eh, the troom troom tutorials are okay at best, I prefer the wiki how ones
Danny is out here teaching life lessons about kidnappings and troom troom
SILLY DANNY YOU NEED TO BE THE KIDNAPPER NOT THE KIDNAPPIE
Ah all the bots are here already Ight imma head out
I didn’t think troom troom could ever be helpful, I still don’t think they can
Troom Troom back at it again
Gotta love how awful TroomTroom is
I literally was planning to watch your video, nice timing. And as far as I've seen ( yes I'm writing this 45 seconds after the video was uploaded ), this video will be a banger.
Ah, and so we've returned home. To our awful home filled with hot glue and questionable practices.
Danny
who else is here just as this is released
we’ve had ratatoing romanticise rats and goverboe and troom troom romanticise kidnapping. ooh boy what’s next 😩👌
This is so relatable I HATE when I get kidnapped.
The new troom troom voice is so annoying I hate it so much
Guys I really appreciate you wanting to bless my family but holy shit these comments are annoying
i needed a comfort video, searched danny gonzalaz, this was posted a minute ago thank

If troom troom had any morals they would donate their money from this video to a charity that helps trafficking victims.
